[00:00] Whereas Bitcoin, you have to be honest
[00:01] and truthful because there is no other
[00:03] choice, right? There are just rules and
[00:06] you either abide by the rules or Bitcoin
[00:08] won't accept them. People like what real
[00:10] estate says about them. They like to
[00:12] say, "Hey, I own this house over here in
[00:14] Chicago. Hey, I have a bunch of storage
[00:16] units in Portland." It's fun for them to
[00:18] go to a party and talk about that.
[00:19] Tangibility is really a mirage because
[00:21] with real estate, it is just a balance
[00:23] sheet. It really is just on paper. The
[00:25] people that are investing in the real
[00:27] estate, the real estate investors who
[00:28] already have other jobs like you or me
[00:31] or whoever, it's really only 4 to 5% if
[00:33] you stretch it out. Income taxes are
[00:35] much, much greater than capital gains
[00:37] taxes. If I do have to sell a Bitcoin,
[00:40] I'm going to be taxed down here at
[00:41] capital gains, but only when I sell.
[00:43] There's no taxes by just holding. The
[00:45] killer app of Bitcoin is that you can
[00:47] self-custody property. We've never been
[00:50] able to selfcustody property because it
[00:52] could always be taken from you. It can
[00:54] be reappropriated. You know, world
[00:55] history, global monetary systems, it's
[00:58] not going to want to accept anything but
[01:00] Bitcoin.
[01:03] [Music]
[01:06] Hi Terren, how are you doing? Everything
[01:07] fine on your end? Good. How are you
[01:10] doing? I'm glad to be back. Be exciting.
[01:12] Absolutely. I loved our first
[01:13] conversations. I think we last time we
[01:15] really talked about AI choosing Bitcoin
[01:19] a little bit also about uh real estate
[01:21] and and some other topics but like I
[01:23] think AI was was a big focus. Have you
[01:25] any updates actually on on on how you
[01:28] look on AI before we get into real
[01:30] estate?
[01:32] H no, I just continue to uh believe that
[01:38] as
[01:41] AI scour and ingests all of the
[01:46] information of the world, you know,
[01:47] world history, global monetary
[01:50] systems, it's not going to want to
[01:52] accept anything but Bitcoin. And I I
[01:56] think that that's pretty cool because if
[01:57] you think about
[01:59] how humans are rejecting Bitcoin or not
[02:02] understanding Bitcoin because they don't
[02:04] want to do the work. Well, AI can do the
[02:07] work in a 30th of a second. And so you
[02:11] think about that like if I could push a
[02:13] button on a human and say boop, do the
[02:15] work. Download these 20 books, all these
[02:17] podcasts, all this
[02:19] information. I I'm convinced that
[02:22] everyone would understand Bitcoin. You
[02:23] know, you put someone in a Turkish
[02:24] prison and you say, "Here's 10 Bitcoin
[02:26] books." They're going to come out of
[02:28] there and say, "Okay, give me rush me to
[02:30] Bitcoin as quickly as possible." So AI
[02:32] will do that within seconds. And so I
[02:35] can't really see how AI would choose
[02:38] anything. But Bitcoin as as agents, as
[02:42] uh super agents with each other, you
[02:43] know, to delegate um various tasks to
[02:47] each other because they're trying to all
[02:48] solve problems. Won't won't they want to
[02:51] do it the most? AI is all about
[02:53] optimizing. How do I get there quicker
[02:55] and the most efficient way possible?
[02:57] Well, to me, that is Bitcoin as far as
[03:00] moving money, right? There's probably
[03:02] other tokens that can move fast, but
[03:03] they're not moving money. They're just
[03:04] moving their own token. Yeah, they might
[03:07] use some internal tokens uh to to move
[03:10] quick around within the ecosystem where
[03:12] you don't need trust or anything like
[03:13] that, where you don't need the security
[03:15] aspect of that. That's a good point. But
[03:17] the when it comes to money storing uh
[03:20] through space and time, it's it's a
[03:22] no-brainer to choose Bitcoin. Yeah. AI
[03:24] is going to sit there and say, "Okay,
[03:25] should I use Tron?" And it's be like,
[03:27] "Okay, let me save Tron cuz I have all
[03:29] these tasks I need to do." Oh, wait. But
[03:30] what if this one AI I ask over here
[03:33] won't accept Tron. Well, now he's stuck.
[03:37] But guess what? They're all going to
[03:38] accept Bitcoin. So, yeah. Interesting.
[03:43] Um I really enjoyed uh you talk about
[03:46] real estate also. Um and you said uh you
[03:50] do a lot of work on on real estate
[03:52] versus Bitcoin. How have you come to
[03:54] that? Yeah. So, it's like, you know, so
[03:56] many um people have been bringing in
[04:00] people from traditional finance, from
[04:02] legacy finance, from Wall Street with
[04:04] the whole digital gold narrative because
[04:07] often times investors and traders sort
[04:10] of get the hedge of gold. They get that
[04:12] it's a commodity um to help blunt some
[04:16] of the volatility of all of their their
[04:18] stocks and their trading.
[04:20] In my life and in my world, I don't know
[04:23] anyone that owns gold. You know, as you
[04:25] know, most millennials and Gen Z's, I I
[04:28] think less than like two or 3% even own
[04:30] gold. And most of that's because it's
[04:32] been handed down over generations. Like
[04:33] a grandma or grandpa gave them some
[04:35] jewelry. Like, no one wants
[04:37] gold that I know of and in my circles.
[04:42] And there's just so much uh friction and
[04:45] barriers to try to not only get actual
[04:48] gold but then to sell gold and you know
[04:50] fractionalize it and divide it and
[04:51] everything we know that's wrong with
[04:52] something that's analog that yes has
[04:54] worked for um centuries but now that
[04:57] we're in a digital world it doesn't
[04:58] really work and I think that's why for
[05:00] me the narrative of digital gold has
[05:02] never really has never really worked and
[05:05] in my circles and I will guess that
[05:09] beyond my circles I mean every country
[05:11] every nation, anywhere you go, everyone
[05:14] gets real estate because everyone has to
[05:16] live somewhere. Everyone would love to
[05:19] have their own place. The problem is
[05:21] that um what I've noticed, so by the
[05:24] way, I so I you know how we love our
[05:26] Bitcoin conferences, we love our Bitcoin
[05:28] meetups and stuff. So take that and
[05:30] times it by a thousand. That's the real
[05:32] estate world. And I've been to all of
[05:34] those real estate meetups. I've been in
[05:35] those like I've been this Bitcoin guy
[05:38] but with the real estate hat and I know
[05:41] the Kool-Aid that they're drinking. I
[05:43] know that the narratives that they all
[05:45] repeat just like we do in
[05:47] Bitcoin. The problem is that a lot of
[05:49] them just aren't honest with themselves.
[05:52] Whereas Bitcoin, you have to be honest
[05:54] and truthful because there is no other
[05:56] choice, right? There are just rules and
[05:58] you either abide by the rules or Bitcoin
[06:01] won't accept them. Real estate allows
[06:03] you to do whatever you want. And because
[06:05] of that, real estate investors aren't
[06:09] honest. And so, this is the thing that
[06:11] I've noticed, and this is where I now go
[06:13] to these meetups. I now um talk to real
[06:16] estate groups, and I say, "Hey, everyone
[06:18] raise your hand. Can we just be honest?"
[06:20] So, the first thing is, so, as you know,
[06:23] there's like $900 trillion in our global
[06:25] monetary system. About a third of that
[06:28] is in income and investment real estate.
[06:30] That's a huge amount of money. And I'm
[06:33] not talking about if someone wants to
[06:34] own their own home and have the white
[06:36] picket fence and raise the family. I get
[06:38] that. I still think there's problems
[06:39] with that. And I still think renting is
[06:41] potentially better for most people. But
[06:43] set that aside. Even if you want to own
[06:44] your own home, I'm talking about
[06:46] everyone who wants a second home, an
[06:48] Airbnb, a rental, four units here, or
[06:51] they want to invest in shopping centers,
[06:53] storage units, office space. Everyone's
[06:56] like, "Yes, I want passive money. I want
[06:57] mailbox money. I want to make money
[06:59] while I sleep, right? Why not? That
[07:01] sounds like a dream. And so people in
[07:03] get in real estate. They also are
[07:05] somewhat programmed and conditioned ever
[07:08] since they're young that like, hey,
[07:10] they're not making any more land. Get
[07:12] real estate. Uh you're always going to
[07:14] do well in real estate. You know, let
[07:16] let someone else's rent pay for your
[07:18] mortgage. So the first thing I find when
[07:21] I talk to real estate bros is that
[07:24] they're not honest about the fact that
[07:26] they like the brag. They like the flex.
[07:28] People like what real estate says about
[07:31] them. They like to say, "Hey, I own this
[07:33] house over here in Chicago. Hey, I have
[07:35] a bunch of storage units in Portland.
[07:38] Uh, I have an Airbnb in Florida." Right?
[07:40] It's fun for them to go to a party and
[07:42] talk about that. Okay. Well, first of
[07:45] all, what they will admit is that, you
[07:48] know, one of the first rules of real
[07:49] estate is that you can't get emotional
[07:51] because if it goes up in price, you have
[07:54] to flip it, right? Real estate goes in
[07:56] these cycles and you can't just hang on
[07:57] to it forever or if you're hanging on to
[07:59] it forever, you're not going to get to
[08:01] enjoy the Airbnb because if it's a
[08:02] business, it's constantly rented out.
[08:04] You're not going to, you know, there's
[08:06] nothing for you to do with the storage
[08:07] units or with the office space. It's
[08:10] really just a balance sheet. So, like
[08:13] Bitcoin, which people complain about,
[08:14] they're like, "Oh, there's no
[08:15] tangibility to Bitcoin. Um, I'm just
[08:18] looking at a number." Well, tangibility
[08:21] is really a mirage because with real
[08:22] estate, it is just a balance sheet. It
[08:24] really is just on paper what the the
[08:28] only tangibility is if there's like, you
[08:30] know, a a sewer clog or a toilet backs
[08:33] up or, you know, the roof needs to be
[08:34] redone. That's the only time there's
[08:36] really tangibility to real estate. Other
[08:37] than that, it is an investment. You buy
[08:39] it. You can't get emotional. Ideally,
[08:42] you flip it. The people that make the
[08:43] most money in real estate, they flip it.
[08:45] They they they buy something, they fix
[08:48] it up. 6 to 8 weeks, they flip it. They
[08:50] can't get emotional. And those that hang
[08:52] on to it long term, if you look at their
[08:54] long kegger, their their compound annual
[08:57] growth rate, it's really this and this
[09:00] is shocking, but they again real estate
[09:02] people have to be honest, it's only four
[09:03] to 5%. Four to 5%. Now, you say, "Well,
[09:06] wait a minute. I always hear about
[09:08] people talking about 20%, 30% in real
[09:10] estate." Yes. And they're talking about
[09:12] very brief moments in time. They're
[09:15] discounting the great financial crisis
[09:17] that we had in 2008, 2009. They're
[09:19] discounting the savings and loan crisis.
[09:21] They're also discounting the fact
[09:23] that yes, if you are a real estate
[09:26] developer professional, you went to
[09:29] school for it, this is your degree,
[09:31] you've got a master's in it, you're
[09:32] like, this is what you do for a living.
[09:34] This is how you mine fiat. Yes, you can
[09:36] potentially make some some decent gains.
[09:39] Absolutely. and you can get up there in
[09:40] the in the 20 to 30% range, but that's
[09:42] rare because there's so many times
[09:45] people lose their money because those
[09:48] developers really are only putting in 2
[09:49] to 3% of their own money. They're going
[09:52] to people like you, Rob, and they're
[09:53] going to me. They're forming limited
[09:55] partnerships, these syndicates where
[09:57] they're only 3 to 4% of the capital
[09:59] stack, and then they raise all this
[10:00] money on top from investors to go then
[10:03] buy this property. Now they're going to
[10:04] go get a $400 million, you know,
[10:06] apartment complex with, you know, 100
[10:08] doors, 100 units and, you know, redo the
[10:11] appliances and the doors and, you know,
[10:12] try to flip it in five, six years and
[10:13] sell it to an institution. But the
[10:17] people that are investing in the real
[10:18] estate, the real estate investors who
[10:20] already have other jobs like you or me
[10:23] or whoever, it's really only four to 5%
[10:26] if you stretch it out. So you have to
[10:28] first of all say to yourself, okay, are
[10:31] you willing to have all this friction,
[10:34] all this work, all this stress, all
[10:36] these headaches of having a tangible
[10:39] property just to get four to 5%. when
[10:43] you know Bitcoin is doing easily over
[10:46] 10x that and maybe into the future that
[10:48] comes down a little bit to eight or 9x
[10:50] but completely passive with I mean with
[10:54] you know completely frictionless which
[10:57] you know we both know. So, that's the
[11:00] first hump I'm finding with real estate
[11:02] people that if you could get them in a
[11:04] in a mode of thinking critically and
[11:07] being honest with themselves and say,
[11:08] "Hey, are you willing to take a away the
[11:11] label and the flex that that, hey, I'm a
[11:15] real estate investor," or, "Hey, I own
[11:16] all these properties." If you take that
[11:18] away and you say to yourself, "Well, I
[11:19] really only own own real estate for what
[11:21] it can get me because I'm going to flip
[11:23] it or I'm going to get this cash flow or
[11:25] I'm going to have this money." If you're
[11:27] realistic about that, you really don't
[11:29] need real estate, right? Wouldn't you
[11:30] rather would you accept some other magic
[11:34] thing over here that gives you 10x that
[11:38] and you can go to sleep at night and not
[11:39] be woken up in the middle of the night
[11:40] to toilets and trash and tenants and
[11:43] have your yearly taxes even if you
[11:44] haven't sold it. So then they'll say to
[11:47] me, here's the second thing, Rob, and
[11:48] they'll say, well, I get cash flow. I
[11:51] don't, you know, I I have cash flow. And
[11:53] here's my response to that. Again, they
[11:55] have to be honest with themselves. Cash
[11:57] flow is just another form of
[12:00] appreciation. So, first of all, most
[12:02] real estate investors don't get cash
[12:03] flow because they're flipping it, right?
[12:06] You could buy Bitcoin and you could sell
[12:07] Bitcoin just like flipping it. Second,
[12:10] the cash flow, the people that are
[12:12] getting cash flow is be is a reward for
[12:15] ill liquidity. You can't obviously
[12:17] fractionalize your real estate. I can't
[12:19] take off, you know, Michael Sailor can't
[12:20] take off the door knob from his front
[12:22] door and, you know, go buy a coffee or a
[12:25] dinner with that. You know, that
[12:26] degrades his real estate. You take off
[12:28] the doors, the windows, the walls,
[12:30] right? You can't do that. Bitcoin, you
[12:32] can. And whereas most people can't
[12:34] invest in real estate unless they're
[12:36] already privileged, already sit close to
[12:38] the money printer and get cheap,
[12:39] inexpensive loans, um, or are part of
[12:42] syndicates or accredited investors or
[12:44] qualified investors because you have to
[12:46] have a certain amount down. does require
[12:48] a certain amount of wealth to even get
[12:49] into real estate in the first place.
[12:51] Obviously, with Bitcoin, it doesn't
[12:52] matter cuz one sat will accrete and
[12:55] appreciate the same as a whole Bitcoin
[12:57] or 10 Bitcoin. So, if I could go over
[12:59] to, you know, someone's mansion in
[13:02] Florida or in London and be like, "Wow,
[13:04] I can't believe your property is going
[13:06] up 10% this year. I wish I could, but I
[13:08] don't have enough money to." It's like,
[13:09] well, I could buy a crumb of his stucco
[13:12] on the outside of his wall and go up at
[13:14] the same time as him. So real estate
[13:17] investors are like, "Well, yeah, I I
[13:18] like this cash flow." It's like, "Well,
[13:20] first of all, you have to put up a large
[13:21] amount of wealth to get the cash flow.
[13:23] You're not even getting back your full
[13:24] amount of money unless you're going to
[13:26] sit there for 10, 20 years." Um, also,
[13:29] you're taxed on that cash flow. That
[13:31] cash flow is income. And everybody knows
[13:33] income taxes are are much much greater
[13:36] than capital gains taxes. If I do have
[13:39] to sell a Bitcoin, I'm going to be taxed
[13:41] down here at a capital gains, but only
[13:43] when I sell. There's no taxes by just
[13:45] holding real estate. They're paying
[13:48] yearly property taxes, right? Which is
[13:50] why property taxes are just a rebrand of
[13:54] rent, right? All there is in the world
[13:57] is rent. And this is another thing for
[14:00] for real estate investors to just think
[14:02] critically about like you are always
[14:04] renting. You might like what the word
[14:06] owning says to you rather than renting.
[14:09] But I either rent to a landlord if I
[14:11] rent rent or I rent to the county in
[14:14] which I live if I own because the minute
[14:17] I don't pay those property taxes, you
[14:21] get a lean and they'll kick you out just
[14:22] like a landlord. So that isn't true
[14:24] ownership, right? The definition of
[14:25] ownership is that you possess it, right?
[14:28] And that is as we know the killer app of
[14:30] Bitcoin. The killer app of Bitcoin is
[14:33] that you can
[14:34] self-custody property. We've never been
[14:37] able to self-custody property because it
[14:40] could always be taken from you. It can
[14:42] be reappropriated. And that's another
[14:44] thing that especially the big real
[14:45] estate developers won't often like to
[14:48] admit. It's that that like you know an
[14:50] airport can be built across the street.
[14:53] Um a a a county can come in with eminent
[14:55] domain. They could acquire it. Like they
[14:57] literally can say this is the market
[14:58] value we're paying you because we need
[14:59] to expand roads. A school can be built
[15:02] next door. You can have noisy neighbors.
[15:05] like you just you don't know what's
[15:06] going to happen. You can't pick up your
[15:08] real estate. You can't move it to it to
[15:11] another place. You know, we can't cross
[15:14] lines drawn in sand. We're stuck. And
[15:17] also, it's not it's it's not fungeable.
[15:21] And every real estate investor will
[15:22] admit the day that they sell their
[15:24] property, they're like, I can't believe
[15:27] someone actually bought it. Because
[15:29] every piece of property is unique. It's
[15:31] all different. Even if you're in a in a
[15:33] complex where there's a hundred houses
[15:35] that look alike, they have different
[15:37] light, they face different places,
[15:38] again, different
[15:40] neighbors. And so you can continue to go
[15:42] down this list of taxes, of cash flow,
[15:46] of every single thing, especially for
[15:48] the investments, for the income, for the
[15:50] people that that again have a property
[15:52] that they can't even visit or see
[15:54] because they're so successful renting it
[15:55] out. Well, Bitcoin, unless people don't
[16:00] like math, will literally say we can
[16:03] beat real estate in every single area.
[16:06] We can make real estate portable,
[16:08] divisible, permissionless, censorship
[16:11] free, surveillance free, like it removes
[16:15] everything. Again, if a real estate
[16:16] person's honest and you say, write down
[16:18] in this column everything that you don't
[16:20] like about your real estate, all the
[16:22] things that you have to do, it's really
[16:24] foreign if you think about it. So,
[16:25] here's the thing. Like, real estate
[16:26] investing was never supposed to be real
[16:28] estate investing. You know what it was
[16:29] meant to be? It was meant to be real
[16:30] estate living. We turned it into real
[16:32] estate investing because we're trying to
[16:35] hurdle inflation. We're just trying to
[16:36] keep up. It's a numbers game. And real
[16:38] estate has done a really good job
[16:39] because it absorbs global liquidity. But
[16:42] think how foreign it is that we're
[16:44] investing in something that
[16:46] deteriorates. It literally is sitting
[16:48] outside in the weather and in the
[16:50] elements and that's our investment. And
[16:53] so we're having to spend all this money
[16:55] to continually to upgrade it. Like
[16:58] honestly, if there's a brand new house
[17:00] that's a million bucks, in 20 years it
[17:03] should be $700,000. It's not it's not
[17:06] new anymore. It's not as good.
[17:10] Um, Bitcoin doesn't have that problem.
[17:13] And you know, your audience is probably
[17:15] mostly Bitcoiners, Robin, so they, you
[17:17] know, they all know this. Um, but real
[17:20] estate people, they get so conditioned
[17:23] and so programmed. They've taken these
[17:24] late night courses. They're they're
[17:26] watching these YouTube videos, you know,
[17:29] how can I how can I get this 4-unit
[17:31] apartment complex? I'll I'll live in
[17:32] one. I'll rent at the others that'll pay
[17:35] my rent, you know, but they're taking a
[17:37] huge amount of risk. They have a lot of
[17:38] liabilities.
[17:40] um they're they're having to use a lot
[17:42] of leverage, which can work in a bull
[17:44] market, but we also don't know when the
[17:46] down markets come. And Bitcoin does the
[17:49] same thing. Just like real estate, we
[17:51] have bulls and and bears, but when
[17:53] there's a bear in Bitcoin, you just have
[17:55] to sit there. You don't have to do
[17:57] anything. You know, with real estate,
[17:59] you're still having to pay for the new
[18:01] roof, the new siding, the sprinklers,
[18:03] the landscaper. And by the way, every
[18:05] time a tenant leaves, there's one to two
[18:07] months of turnover, rekeying, new
[18:09] carpets, you know, all the things we
[18:11] know. So, and and I mean, look at and
[18:13] look at CO. You know, some people say,
[18:14] "Well, I don't want to have residential
[18:16] real estate. I want to be the big boy. I
[18:17] want to invest in all commercial real
[18:19] estate." Well, what happened to all
[18:20] those people that had office spaces when
[18:21] CO hit? Those people are still bleeding
[18:24] and a lot of those places are just
[18:26] sitting empty. And I don't know what the
[18:27] next pandemic or the next crisis will
[18:30] bring. what will what could that do that
[18:32] we're not thinking about you know for uh
[18:35] for storage unit space or shop shopping
[18:37] malls like I've been invested in in
[18:39] shopping malls um you know a tiny
[18:42] percent cuz I'm part of like hundreds of
[18:44] other people because these are big you
[18:46] know like practically billion-dollar
[18:48] portfolios but when when co hit those
[18:51] two they got decimated and now people
[18:54] are trying to figure out what to do with
[18:55] all these dated indoor shopping malls so
[18:59] anyways I've been talking probably way
[19:01] more than I should and um I can go into
[19:02] more of it, but that's kind of like the
[19:04] big idea when I I get into these groups
[19:07] and all you have to do is almost be a
[19:08] therapist with a real estate person and
[19:10] just ask them questions. Why are you
[19:11] really in real estate? Okay, you want
[19:13] the money? Great. Are you really getting
[19:15] cash flow? And all the and all the time
[19:17] that there's problems with this this
[19:18] real estate cash flow stops by the way.
[19:20] That's the first thing that stops. So
[19:22] even people that say, "Oh, I like the
[19:24] cash flow." They're not getting the cash
[19:25] flow that they think they are because of
[19:27] all the other because where how do you
[19:28] pay for the expenses from that cash
[19:30] flow. So you show them how Bitcoin is
[19:34] digital property. It's property in
[19:36] cyberspace and I don't have to worry
[19:38] about a zip code. I don't have to go
[19:39] north,southeast, west. I go
[19:41] up and it's scarce. It's a neighborhood
[19:45] with only 21 million plots. I can get
[19:48] one of these plots or a fraction of the
[19:50] plot.
[19:52] And unlike real estate, if someone
[19:54] happens to lose their Bitcoin or you
[19:57] know it burns down, your house burns
[19:58] down, no one can make a new one. So now
[20:01] it's even that much more scarce. Now
[20:02] everyone else who's being responsible
[20:04] and hanging on to their Bitcoin, you
[20:06] know, really their Bitcoin keys, then
[20:08] their property becomes even that much
[20:10] more valuable. So I mean, it's just to
[20:12] me it's so obvious to you. It's so
[20:14] obvious. You get all of this and and I
[20:17] know you fully fully fully get this.
[20:18] I've heard you talk about this as well,
[20:21] but the but the real estate people
[20:22] haven't stopped to think about it.
[20:24] They're like, "Ah, I I I I don't get
[20:27] it." So, I think educating about Bitcoin
[20:31] and comparing it to real
[20:33] estate is a big idea and is a big idea
[20:36] that I feel is way more helpful to most
[20:39] of the world than digital gold. I heard
[20:41] digital gold first and I dismissed it.
[20:44] You know why? I don't care about I don't
[20:46] care about gold. I don't want gold. I
[20:47] know right now at the time of recording
[20:49] gold is having its moment but you know
[20:51] go over 15 20 years it's mostly been
[20:54] flat right it's it's you know in what
[20:57] it's been around for 5,000 years and you
[20:59] know we're now at whatever over $3,000
[21:02] like you know Bitcoin's you know barely
[21:04] been here and you know we're tapping
[21:06] 100k. There are a lot of interesting
[21:08] points in there. Oh man I I I love it.
[21:12] Um I I want to start with a maybe um a
[21:16] personal a small story. I was really
[21:20] close to buying real estate before I
[21:24] discovered Bitcoin. I discovered Bitcoin
[21:26] when I was 21 22 years old. And this was
[21:30] right at the moment where I first got my
[21:32] first job for a few years. I made some
[21:35] money in the stock market and I was
[21:37] looking for like oh I can actually take
[21:39] some out to make a down payment on a
[21:41] real estate to get into this investing
[21:43] world also. It was right at that moment
[21:45] where I also discovered Bitcoin and
[21:47] luckily I never went into real estate
[21:50] and luckily I actually discovered
[21:52] Bitcoin. It saved me a lot of headache.
[21:54] It saved me a lot of uh clarity and
[21:57] focus uh from from real estate way to
[22:01] Bitcoin and now I can just have Bitcoin
[22:05] and I don't like if I wouldn't be a
[22:08] Bitcoin podcaster and I would I don't
[22:10] know have have an AI podcast for example
[22:14] I wouldn't have to worry about Bitcoin
[22:16] at all because I know it's there. It's
[22:19] okay. It's it's like I don't have to
[22:20] look at it every day. I can in the
[22:23] beginning most do uh but the longer you
[22:25] have it you don't have to look at it and
[22:27] this really saved a lot of my life
[22:30] energy actually do not go and fix
[22:34] toilets and then or hire someone that
[22:36] fix toilet and and do all those things.
[22:39] It's a lot of headache that you got that
[22:42] I got saved from and uh hopefully a lot
[22:44] of other people also got saved from and
[22:48] I heard out that you have been investing
[22:50] in real estate uh a lot or do you invest
[22:54] in real are you completely out now or
[22:56] did you um get out of real estate and
[22:58] now fully in Bitcoin? I'm not fully out
[23:01] and this again is another problem. I
[23:03] can't get out because some of the the
[23:05] big projects that I got into like for
[23:08] instance I own a bunch of leases for um
[23:11] CVS and Walgreens's um you know so
[23:14] there's these big buildings where these
[23:16] um you know what do you call them you
[23:17] know consumer consumer stores right
[23:19] where you pick up toothpaste and cereal
[23:21] and whatnot and they haveies
[23:24] um I'm invested in those with in what's
[23:26] called syndicates right where there is a
[23:28] sponsor who found it um but then I'm
[23:31] part of the stack of all of the
[23:33] investors that came in to invest in it.
[23:36] I can't get out of those until they
[23:37] decide to sell until they sell. I mean,
[23:40] I could be in some of those for the next
[23:41] 20 years. Like, I can't get out of
[23:44] those. Now, ones that I personally went
[23:46] into, I have fully gotten out in. You
[23:48] know, I had all these Airbnbs. Uh, I had
[23:50] one in Joshua Tree. I had one in
[23:52] Nashville. I had one in Palm Springs. I
[23:55] had one in Austin. I was picking all the
[23:57] cool neighborhoods and all these places.
[23:59] And guess what? They were constantly
[24:02] booked, always rented out, like amazing.
[24:05] But guess what? That was my second job.
[24:08] That was a job. And when things went
[24:11] well, man, those checks looked so good.
[24:13] Wow, these checks are just flying in.
[24:15] Right. People going to Coachella in Palm
[24:17] Springs. It's like, this was amazing.
[24:20] But then, you know, in the middle of the
[24:21] night, it's like, oh, the heater for the
[24:23] pool isn't working. The, you know, the
[24:25] toilet's clogged. Um, the air
[24:26] conditioner is not working, and it's
[24:28] 120° out here. It's like and I'm now
[24:31] jumping in the car and driving 3 hours
[24:33] out to the desert to solve a problem.
[24:35] It's like suddenly I bought myself
[24:37] another job because those properties
[24:40] didn't just come to me magically. I had
[24:41] to buy them. I had to put up a
[24:43] significant amount of capital just to
[24:45] get those in the first place.
[24:48] So once I graduated uh beyond just
[24:53] single family homes and renting them out
[24:55] and or flipping, I've also flipped about
[24:57] a dozen homes personally myself where I
[25:00] bought the house, I fixed it, I worked
[25:02] worked on it and sold it, you know,
[25:05] boom. And and I I did that uh every
[25:09] every year to two years. It's like sell
[25:12] sell. you know, I I executive produced
[25:15] um and show ran this TV show on on TV
[25:17] called Fix My Flip, right? And so, it's
[25:20] like I'm I'm very much into flipping
[25:23] houses and I was doing all of that, but
[25:25] if I was honest with myself, I didn't
[25:26] care about the house. I would find the
[25:28] ugliest thing and I didn't care what it
[25:29] looked like afterwards. It's just get
[25:31] it. It's It almost feels like a meme
[25:33] token in a way. It's like I'm getting
[25:34] it. I know I have to get rid of it as
[25:36] quickly as possible cuz it's like as
[25:38] soon because the longer I hang on to it,
[25:40] I'm I'm servicing all that debt. I'm
[25:42] servicing the the mortgage and the
[25:44] investor's money who I took to be able
[25:45] to get the house in the first place. So
[25:48] then so anyways, I graduated to all of
[25:50] these syndicates in these bigger
[25:52] commercial properties where it would be
[25:53] like 300 unit apartment complex um 600
[25:58] unit apartment complex all these garden
[26:00] style places and whenever those exited
[26:04] uh between I want to say like 2019 2020
[26:08] and now I would start moving that into
[26:10] Bitcoin. But some of those I'm still
[26:12] stuck in. And and you know what? The few
[26:14] that I'm stuck in now are all now losing
[26:16] money. The cash flow has stopped. I
[26:18] mean, some of them for two years, no
[26:20] cash flow, you know. Sorry, dear
[26:21] investors. We had to stop cash flow, you
[26:24] know, due to the economy, due to COVID,
[26:26] due to this. So, so, so me getting into
[26:28] those in the first place for cash flow,
[26:30] none. My down payment on on many of
[26:33] these, which could be anywhere from like
[26:35] 25 to
[26:36] $100,000, is held hostage. I don't have
[26:38] access to that. And in Bitcoin terms,
[26:41] I'm just losing. I'm like, I'm I'm I'm
[26:44] not growing my purchasing power at all
[26:46] in those. So, at this point, I hope to
[26:48] maybe just get back my principal. By the
[26:50] way, one or two of them, I know I'm only
[26:51] going to get half of my principal back.
[26:53] I just spoke to the owners of one in
[26:54] Texas, and they're like, you know,
[26:56] sorry, you're going to get about half
[26:58] back. We just we're going to have to
[26:59] sell it at a loss. We, you know, because
[27:01] the interest rates are now adjusting. A
[27:04] lot of these commercial properties do
[27:05] really well and they're and what they're
[27:07] trying to do is they try to get into
[27:08] like say a 100 unit apartment complex
[27:10] and their their their plan is to flip it
[27:12] in five years. They want to sell it to
[27:14] Vanguard. They want to sell it to Black
[27:15] Rockck. Those are the biggest buyers. Um
[27:18] but so they'll get these five-year arms,
[27:21] meaning low interest rates for 5 years.
[27:23] So we would have these like 2 3%
[27:25] interest rates. But now that they've
[27:26] adjusted and as we know interest rates
[27:28] are high and now they adjust up to 7 8 9
[27:31] they can't afford it. we can't afford
[27:32] it. So, we sell it at a loss to someone
[27:36] else who will benefit by by getting it
[27:38] way less than us and we get half our
[27:40] capital back. So, I've lost money on a
[27:43] lot of these. Some of them I've done
[27:44] okay, but when I add it all up together
[27:47] and some that look like I killed it, I'm
[27:49] a genius. And then these other losses
[27:51] and then you spread out this long time
[27:53] frame, it's like you're talking four to
[27:55] 5%. It's crazy.
[27:58] And I think that's why the theme of this
[28:00] talk today is that real estate investors
[28:03] need to be honest with
[28:05] themselves, you know, and this is what
[28:07] Bitcoin sort of helps us reveal in the
[28:08] fiat world. It helps reveal the way
[28:11] things really are. So yeah, so I'm so
[28:14] I'm unfortunately still stuck in some of
[28:15] these things. So I'm still technically a
[28:18] real estate investor even though I I
[28:19] don't want to be at all. I want to just
[28:21] be a Bitcoin saver.
[28:24] I think this this realization that real
[28:27] estate is not investing but it is a
[28:30] business. So you basically you you said
[28:33] you buy I love that term buying a job.
[28:37] So like you you're buying yourself a job
[28:39] when you do real estate. I think that
[28:41] realization a lot of people haven't had.
[28:44] I it's probably also in America very
[28:46] popular but in Austria it's extremely
[28:49] popular to take your own home. So you
[28:53] live somewhere rural, you buy a house,
[28:56] you live in it, you pay your mortgage
[28:58] for like 30 years and this is your
[29:00] retirement plan. This is your pension.
[29:03] This is how I would say the mid-range of
[29:07] Austrians, not the rich, not the poor,
[29:09] like the mid-range is looking at their
[29:12] pension in Austria like 80% of
[29:15] people. It's it's so hard to argue
[29:18] against that. I mean it's easy logically
[29:21] but really hard emotionally because they
[29:23] put their whole life all already towards
[29:25] that they're already living there they
[29:27] have the finances like they they they're
[29:30] betting their whole life on that and
[29:32] sometimes I sit there with them and it's
[29:34] it's almost hard for me emotionally to
[29:36] say like oh like yeah that's that was a
[29:38] huge I I cannot say that like you like
[29:41] that's that's really hard. um they're
[29:44] also stuck there, right? Like like if
[29:46] they want to move, they're so planted,
[29:48] they're so rooted there, it's such an
[29:51] investment and if it's a retirement that
[29:52] it's like what if they want to move or
[29:54] get closer to grandchildren or, you
[29:56] know, closer to a hospital cuz they need
[29:58] it when they're older.
[30:00] How how did you how did you realize So
[30:04] you were in the conferences, you were
[30:06] really close to the real estate um uh in
[30:10] uh economy. How did you all of a sudden
[30:13] realize, oh, like that that's that's BS.
[30:16] I I have to get out of there. So, I
[30:19] mean, I probably shouldn't say this, but
[30:21] I'll say it cuz I don't care. Um cuz now
[30:23] I'm a Bitcoiner. But, um it was when I
[30:27] was doing several real estate TV shows.
[30:30] I've sold real estate TV shows. I've
[30:32] produced real estate TV shows. And let's
[30:34] just say the numbers aren't always 100%
[30:38] real. And that's because we're making a
[30:41] TV show.
[30:43] And you want to, those shows want to
[30:45] encourage people to invest in real
[30:48] estate. They want to show people that
[30:49] you can be a weekend warrior. You can go
[30:52] flip that house. Anyone can make it
[30:55] happen, you know, but you have to learn
[30:56] how to hammer and tile and do all this
[30:58] and and I get that. I me personally, I
[31:00] like doing some of that stuff, which
[31:02] which is fine. The point is that you
[31:04] don't have to do that if you don't want
[31:05] to because we have Bitcoin.
[31:07] But to make the shows
[31:10] interesting, we would buy the house and
[31:12] and we would add up all the numbers of
[31:14] everything that was done by the
[31:15] contractors and the stars of the show
[31:17] and then we would sell the house. But
[31:19] when you minused all of the the capital
[31:22] debt, the debt servicing, when you minus
[31:24] the taxes, when you minus the time it
[31:27] really took us to buy a house and sell a
[31:30] house, which was often a lot longer than
[31:32] we said on
[31:33] television, they weren't making that
[31:35] much money.
[31:37] and and it was just so there was that.
[31:40] The second thing that made me realize it
[31:41] is that when I became a Bitcoiner, I
[31:43] learned what inflation really is. I
[31:45] didn't really know. We all think we
[31:48] knows what inflation is, but I didn't
[31:49] know. And I realized, you know, there's
[31:51] this amazing meme. Um I don't know if
[31:54] your editors can put it up while we're
[31:55] talking, but if not, I'll describe it.
[31:57] But there's this amazing meme where it's
[31:58] tight on this little kid. Um and he's
[32:01] he's dunking a basket into the basket,
[32:04] right? and he's called, you know, real
[32:05] estate, right? Hey, we think we're
[32:07] really good at real estate. He's dunking
[32:09] it. But then you back up and his dad is
[32:12] holding him up to the basket, putting it
[32:14] in. And the dad is inflation. And that's
[32:17] really what I realized is that anytime
[32:20] and every time I thought or I was
[32:22] witnessing people kill it in real
[32:24] estate, it was because of inflation.
[32:26] There was a lot of money printing coming
[32:28] into the system, a lot of dollars. And
[32:30] how do those dollars come in? Well, we
[32:32] know that there's several ways that the
[32:34] government money prints or the central
[32:36] bank money prints, I should say, but one
[32:38] of the biggest ways is lowering interest
[32:41] rates. It's credit. Credit creation
[32:43] creates dollars. Those dollars didn't
[32:44] exist. And so, the people that stick
[32:48] that's Yes, you know it. This is
[32:50] perfect. And so, I so I was always
[32:54] zoomed in on that kid with the
[32:56] basketball and that was me. And when I
[32:59] found
[33:00] Bitcoin, someone panned, someone pulled
[33:03] out, they zoomed out to a wide and I was
[33:06] like, "Holy crap." I am not. This is
[33:10] what has been happening the whole time.
[33:12] And this just blew my mind. And now
[33:15] here's the funny thing. Some people will
[33:16] say, "Oh, well that's just Bitcoin." And
[33:18] I'd say, "Okay, great. Let's say you are
[33:20] right and that is Bitcoin. Awesome. But
[33:22] now I'm not but I'm not I don't have to
[33:24] do anything. I just save in Bitcoin.
[33:26] That's it. I'm not having to throw a
[33:28] basketball into a basket. I buy the
[33:31] Bitcoin, I save it, and I just sit
[33:32] there. So, that was a huge revelation to
[33:36] me. And that's why, like I recently made
[33:39] a video on inflation, which is so basic
[33:41] to us Bitcoiners now, but it's like
[33:43] people don't really know what inflation
[33:45] is.
[33:47] So I um I said I got to get out of this
[33:50] as soon as possible and get it into
[33:52] Bitcoin because the longer it takes the
[33:55] more that I am leaving on the table in
[33:57] appreciation. And so I I have been
[34:00] trying to get out of real estate as fast
[34:01] as I can and I did of everything I
[34:03] could. I have sold everything that I can
[34:07] sell individually or if I had one or two
[34:09] partners. But now the things that I'm in
[34:11] with hundreds of people I, you know, I
[34:14] just write it off to like that was just
[34:16] that was me. That was past me, right? I
[34:19] unplugged from that and I've moved to
[34:20] the new better world and I still have
[34:22] some property in the old world, you
[34:24] know, but um it's imperfect property.
[34:28] Now I have incorruptible, impenetrable
[34:30] property. Let's take a break for a
[34:32] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[34:35] Coin Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[34:38] watches. Those watches are the most
[34:40] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[34:43] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[34:47] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:49] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:53] watch collections. You have the date of
[34:55] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[34:58] there. And of course, also the block
[35:00] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:03] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:06] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:09] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:12] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:14] love those watches so so much. And now
[35:17] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:20] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:22] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:24] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[35:26] first way is you put it on a hardware
[35:28] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[35:31] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[35:34] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[35:37] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[35:40] if you check out the link in the
[35:42] description, you even get 5% off if you
[35:45] use the code Robin. And the second way
[35:47] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[35:51] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[35:54] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[35:57] They will personalize for you a
[35:59] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:02] your individual situation. They will
[36:05] show you how you can secure your own
[36:07] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:09] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:11] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:14] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:16] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:19] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:22] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:24] last but not least, if you're in a
[36:26] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[36:29] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[36:31] that, head over to the
[36:35] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[36:37] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[36:40] will be for the first time ever speaking
[36:43] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:46] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:48] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:50] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:53] the link down in the description of
[36:55] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[36:57] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:01] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:03] there. I It's so unfortunate that I
[37:05] cannot put that site up because it's
[37:07] it's the I think the the provider just
[37:10] like stopped uh putting that site up. Do
[37:13] you know priced in Bitcoin
[37:15] 21 the the the website? Oh, are you
[37:18] talking about talking real estate? No,
[37:19] no. Uh yeah, like there's a site. It was
[37:22] one of my favorite sites uh in Bitcoin.
[37:25] It was called priced priced in Bitcoin
[37:28] 21 and and for some reason it's not
[37:30] reachable for a few weeks now and it
[37:33] brought it up so many times in the show
[37:34] because you see all of things priced in
[37:39] Bitcoin. So you can see orangees priced
[37:41] in Bitcoin. You you can see uh the stock
[37:43] market priced in Bitcoin. And basically
[37:46] it flips the script of you pricing
[37:49] everything in Bitcoin and then you see
[37:50] the true um the true true price of what
[37:55] bit where real estate where the stock
[37:57] market actually is going. If you use
[38:00] Bitcoin as the anchor, everything is
[38:01] going down.
[38:03] And this was this amazing chart of
[38:05] seeing like 5 years ago average home in
[38:08] the US was let's say 30 bitcoin and now
[38:12] it's like five bitcoin and this price is
[38:15] just sinking and sinking and sinking and
[38:16] it really opens the eyes of like oh yeah
[38:19] real estate is going up but because of
[38:22] inflation if you put it in gold or in
[38:25] bitcoin or in anything hard bitcoin is
[38:27] is the most extreme of course because
[38:29] it's the best money if you put it in
[38:31] that the real estate market is crashing
[38:34] what was it
[38:36] 98.5% or something like that in the last
[38:38] five years and it's it's it this is
[38:41] actually what I usually show the people
[38:43] that hold real estate are you sure
[38:45] you're making money are you real estate
[38:48] is going up well this will so this when
[38:50] I tell people this this blows them away
[38:52] so my house right now that I'm sitting
[38:54] in um I paid
[38:58] 1,818 Bitcoin in 2014 14. Now, I didn't
[39:02] pay it in Bitcoin because I wasn't a
[39:05] Bitcoiner yet in 2014. I I paid it in US
[39:07] dollars, but in in hindsight, it costs
[39:10] 1,818 Bitcoin. Today, it's worth about
[39:15] 1718 Bitcoin. That's all. 17 or 18
[39:18] Bitcoin. And I know in four or five
[39:20] years, it's probably going to be worth
[39:21] about 1 or two.
[39:24] So that like when you when you think
[39:27] about that, that just makes you want to
[39:29] acquire as much Bitcoin as possible
[39:31] because everything's going to get
[39:32] cheaper and cheaper. Now, some people
[39:34] would say cuz cuz I do own my home. I've
[39:37] just hung on to it. And they're probably
[39:39] right that I should sell this house
[39:41] immediately. I can probably rent a
[39:43] similar house for much less and I should
[39:46] take those 16, 17, 18 bitcoin right now
[39:50] because that would be incredible and
[39:51] that would be amazing to have that much
[39:53] Bitcoin and you know go rent something
[39:56] because I could probably buy back this
[39:58] place in four or five years for a couple
[40:00] of Bitcoin and you know and I'd have the
[40:03] difference. So
[40:05] yeah, viewing the world, viewing
[40:07] anything you purchase, any goods or
[40:09] services that you need, viewing it
[40:11] against a fixed tool, a fixed
[40:13] measurement tool will always make it go
[40:15] down. And we and it is just so weird,
[40:18] right? You know this that we measure
[40:20] everything with fixed numbers, whether
[40:23] it's weight or temperature or a ruler.
[40:26] Why don't we do that with our money? It
[40:28] just keeps growing. So we can't we can't
[40:30] coordinate. We can't communicate
[40:32] properly. Um, and speaking of real
[40:34] estate, you know, that's another area
[40:37] that I sometimes the people that are
[40:39] really, really resistant and they will
[40:40] counter everything that I've already
[40:42] told you, I will just say, you know,
[40:44] pretend you're building a house and
[40:45] pretend that measuring tape just keeps
[40:47] growing. So the lumber that you've
[40:48] ordered, you suddenly need more by the
[40:50] time you start building. The cement
[40:51] you've ordered, you suddenly need more.
[40:53] You said, I need 30 lbs of this, but now
[40:55] you need 40. Now you need 50. This is
[40:57] what happens to our money, right? We,
[41:00] you know, the value of your house hasn't
[41:02] gone up. We still have the four
[41:03] bedrooms, the three baths. What has
[41:06] changed? Nothing. In fact, it's
[41:07] deteriorated. So, why is it requiring
[41:08] more dollars? Well, because every dollar
[41:10] is worth less. That, by the way, is
[41:13] obvious to us Bitcoiners again. But real
[41:15] estate people have never thought about
[41:16] that. And I've several times said that
[41:18] to some very well-known real estate
[41:20] people, and they say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[41:21] whoa. Say that. Say that one more time."
[41:24] I'm like, "You need more dollars for
[41:26] your house many years later because each
[41:28] dollar is worth less. It requires more."
[41:31] And they're just like, "Oh my god." Like
[41:34] they feel like they, you know, they've
[41:35] been scoped their whole life. And I'm
[41:36] like, "Yeah, I I never It's so simple as
[41:40] a Bitcoiner, but before you find
[41:42] Bitcoin, you don't that there's no way
[41:44] that you know what? You want to be the
[41:46] hero of of of your life. You want to be
[41:48] the hero of your own story. And this is
[41:50] a big thing that real estate people
[41:51] like. They want to be the hero and they
[41:53] can be the hero. I found this house. I
[41:55] did this. I'm now flipping it. I found
[41:58] these tenants. Haha, look at me. I'm I'm
[42:01] responsible. I'm
[42:03] smart. Um, but you don't need to do any
[42:06] of that and it's not necessarily smart.
[42:08] And it would be nice if the if the
[42:11] ultimate effect of all of this is to
[42:13] reduce the price of some real estate for
[42:16] people that actually just need a place
[42:18] to live, that actually just want a home
[42:20] for their family. because we're not
[42:21] putting a monetary premium on it.
[42:23] Because we're not driving prices up,
[42:24] because we're not treating homes and
[42:27] real estate as piggy banks. That would
[42:28] be amazing. That would be that would be
[42:31] incredible. But oh, so here's something
[42:33] that I think is important probably for
[42:35] your listeners. So, a lot of Bitcoiners
[42:38] are saving for real estate. This here's
[42:40] the irony, right? We just bagged on real
[42:42] estate, but a lot of Bitcoiners like,
[42:43] "Ah, I want my Bitcoin to grow so I can
[42:45] buy real estate." And I totally get
[42:47] that. I do think there is some value in
[42:50] owning a home. But here's what I will
[42:51] say. There's no difference between
[42:53] renting and
[42:54] owning if you're willing to accept that
[42:57] your security deposit is the insurance
[42:59] for that.
[43:02] Meaning, you can go rent and live
[43:05] wherever you want. And of course, you
[43:06] have the freedom to move whenever you
[43:08] want, which is really nice. And of
[43:09] course, your landlord's going to pay for
[43:11] all of the maintenance, all the upkeep,
[43:12] all that, and all the taxes. So there's
[43:15] it's really nice. You can live where you
[43:16] want, pay the rent. You have to put down
[43:20] a security deposit. Well, the security
[43:22] deposit just covers the fact that if you
[43:26] leave and you've done something the
[43:28] landlord doesn't like, he use you he
[43:30] takes from your security deposit and he
[43:32] can't take more than your security
[43:33] deposit. That's what he takes. So, a lot
[43:35] of people are like, "Well, I want to buy
[43:36] because I want to change the
[43:38] countertops. I want to put wallpaper on
[43:41] the walls. I want a different sink."
[43:45] Um, so this is why I first got into real
[43:48] estate, by the way. I was renting and I
[43:51] was fixing up my rentals. I changed out
[43:54] the sinks. I changed out the toilets. I
[43:56] put in hardwood floors in one of my
[43:58] rentals. I literally knocked down a
[44:00] wall. Now, I always went to the landlord
[44:02] first and if they were resistant, I
[44:06] said, "Look, I'm going to pay for
[44:07] everything. I'm still going to pay my
[44:09] rent. I just want to live in a better
[44:11] place." and they would see it afterwards
[44:12] and they were like blown away cuz I just
[44:14] improved their property for them. You
[44:17] know, life is short. We want our
[44:18] surroundings to be nice. And so, you
[44:21] know, why delay doing something? Because
[44:23] you're like, well, I'm renting this
[44:24] place. You know, I man, I would really
[44:26] love to have uh I know I'd really love
[44:28] to have a different front door, but you
[44:30] know,
[44:31] um I'm renting. Why would I do that?
[44:35] Half the time you can go to your
[44:36] landlord. So, I've had tenants come to
[44:38] me when I used to have all kinds of
[44:39] rentals and say, "Hey, we want to we
[44:41] want to uh put a cement wall up. We want
[44:44] to put cement over the wall." And I'd be
[44:45] like, "Great. I'll even reduce your
[44:48] rent." You know, or or or someone has
[44:50] wanted to change the flooring. I'm say,
[44:51] "Great. As long as you pay for it, hire
[44:53] a a contractor who's insured and bonded.
[44:57] I'll I'll reduce your rent by that exact
[44:59] amount because they're improving my
[45:00] property." And I think a lot of renters
[45:02] don't think that way. They think it's
[45:04] temporary. They think they're in a
[45:05] hotel.
[45:06] And it's like, and I lived in a hotel,
[45:08] by the way, for for several years or
[45:10] kind of adjacent to a hotel. And I
[45:14] completely renovated that whole place.
[45:16] And all my friends were like, "What are
[45:18] you doing? You're renting this place. I
[45:20] can't believe I'm like, "Yeah, but I
[45:21] live here. Life is short. I want to
[45:23] enjoy my surroundings while I'm here."
[45:24] And I made my place look so nice. And
[45:26] the landlord loved it. Absolutely loved
[45:28] it.
[45:30] So, that's just something to think about
[45:32] if people are like um I even saw some
[45:35] Bitcoiner post the other day. They're
[45:36] like, "Oh, yeah. I want I want to buy a
[45:38] house because
[45:40] um I don't know. There was like there
[45:42] was like a uh there was a certain type
[45:45] of built-in cabinets that she wanted."
[45:47] She's like, "I want to have these." Oh,
[45:48] yeah. It was I want to have these
[45:49] built-in book cabinets right next to my
[45:51] bed so I can have my bed and buy my
[45:52] books. And I and I DM'd her and I was
[45:55] like, "Build it. Put it on the wall. You
[45:58] can take it off when you leave, but I
[46:00] guarantee you the landlord will probably
[46:01] come in and look it and go, "That's
[46:02] pretty freaking great. Thank you." And
[46:04] if not, the insurance, the fee is your
[46:07] security deposit. Let them get upset and
[46:08] say, "Great, I'm going to take my 2,000,
[46:10] my $3,000." It it's that 2,000 3,000 is
[46:12] way less than you going in and buying a
[46:14] home and paying the taxes and all the
[46:16] maintenance and everything. So that's
[46:18] just something that I think is also
[46:20] helpful that again you have to get past
[46:23] the the have to get past the mental
[46:26] model that I have to own. You know that
[46:29] the that buying a home is the American
[46:31] dream, which by the way is a slogan of a
[46:33] of a real estate company. A real estate
[46:34] company invented homes being the
[46:37] American dream. Now I get it. You want
[46:39] to raise a family, want your own home,
[46:41] great. Buy your own home. But you will
[46:43] buy that as long as you admit that
[46:45] everything isn't about money. And maybe
[46:47] everything isn't about money. If you're
[46:49] okay, Bitcoin is going to go up faster
[46:51] than your house. Full stop. It will 100%
[46:54] go up faster than your house. So, if you
[46:55] want to buy a house, that's great. So,
[46:56] like Natalie Brunell, who we all know,
[46:58] for example, she wants to buy a house. I
[47:00] think she probably now has enough
[47:02] Bitcoin to convert into a house. But,
[47:04] I've heard her say recently, she's like,
[47:06] I think Bitcoin's going to be going up
[47:07] so much faster than if I get a house.
[47:09] So, I'm going to keep renting for a
[47:10] while. I'm going to hang in there
[47:12] because Bitcoin is just going up so
[47:13] fast.
[47:15] And it may not work for her, but she can
[47:19] go rent anything she wants. Anyone can
[47:20] go rent. Everything is for rent. So,
[47:23] it's just something to think about how
[47:25] what's the cost of being able to tell
[47:27] someone, I own my house. That's that's
[47:30] pretty expensive. You know how many
[47:31] people have have gone bankrupt over that
[47:34] narrative? I own my house. You can say I
[47:37] rent my house. It doesn't matter.
[47:39] Doesn't matter. People confuse uh
[47:42] financial
[47:43] stability with owning a home. There's
[47:46] like some sort of sense, oh, you own
[47:49] your own own home, so this means you
[47:52] have to be good financially. So there's
[47:54] this like weird BS narrative around
[47:58] that. You hit you nailed it. That's it.
[48:01] That's that's the realization. We have
[48:03] to admit what it is. Um, yeah, ever
[48:06] since I was a little kid, like you I
[48:07] hear my dad, I hear my uncles, you hear
[48:09] people talking like, "Oh, you know,
[48:10] well, he owns, "Oh, wow. Do you own
[48:12] like, you know, oh, you know, I was just
[48:14] at at a wedding. Like, oh, this this
[48:16] couple got married. Hey, when are you
[48:17] guys going to, you know, buy your own
[48:19] home?" And it's like, stop putting that
[48:21] in their head. They don't need to buy.
[48:23] They don't need to go into debt this
[48:24] young. And, you know, anyways, we get
[48:27] it. How did you I'm just curious. How
[48:29] did you live in a hotel? Uh, and how how
[48:32] long did you do that?
[48:33] Well, it wasn't actually a hotel, but it
[48:35] was right next to the hotel was this
[48:37] little set of like bungalows, these
[48:39] little apartment complexes, but I I
[48:41] liked to take meetings in the lobby.
[48:43] This was back when I was um in
[48:45] Hollywood, and I would take all my
[48:46] meetings and read all my scripts by the
[48:47] pool and got to do all that. But it was
[48:50] the same landlord. That's the only
[48:52] reason why I called it hotel. You know,
[48:53] he was an owner in the hotel and he
[48:55] owned this complex. And so the first
[48:57] time, by the way, uh just getting back
[48:59] to what we just talked about, I didn't
[49:00] even ask him because I was afraid. But I
[49:02] ripped out all the carpet on my own
[49:05] because I noticed there were really nice
[49:06] hardwood floors and I threw it out by
[49:08] the trash and I just thought, "Screw it.
[49:10] He can take my security deposit." But he
[49:12] saw the carpet and he came up to the
[49:14] door knocking and I was really nervous
[49:16] and he opened the door and I think he
[49:18] was going to be upset, but he saw the
[49:19] wood. I mean, I had them sanded and
[49:22] polished. I mean, they were beautiful.
[49:23] And he said, "Thank you. This is
[49:27] beautiful. So, and that's when it
[49:29] started to click. I was like, I renting
[49:31] or owning, it's it's the same thing.
[49:33] It's just a different definition of the
[49:35] same thing. Yeah. Yeah. If there were no
[49:38] property taxes, I might get the
[49:40] difference, right? Like that makes a big
[49:43] difference. But it's like you people can
[49:45] buy a house without any leverage, no
[49:47] mortgage, just here's here's all my
[49:48] cash. Here's all my Bitcoin or all my
[49:50] cash. Here's my house. But now you're
[49:51] paying
[49:53] yearly. I mean, and it's a lot here in
[49:56] here where I live, it's one and a half%.
[49:58] So, you buy a million billion dollar
[50:00] house, you're paying 15,000 a year that
[50:02] doesn't go anywhere, doesn't do
[50:04] anything. That's crazy. That's without
[50:05] the maintenance. Yeah. And I think uh I
[50:09] mean it's Austria is such a small
[50:10] country, but I think that that can
[50:12] happen everywhere.
[50:14] The government is slowly slowly figuring
[50:16] out that they have to save. They're
[50:18] slowly slowly figuring out, oh we
[50:21] spend too much money. The deficits are
[50:22] way bigger than we expected. It's
[50:24] actually it's becoming a meme in
[50:25] Austria. Uh we we just got a new
[50:28] government and the last three months.
[50:32] There is coming out a new number what
[50:35] the deficit for 205 will be and the
[50:38] number is keep doubling every like month
[50:42] or something like that. It it's it's
[50:43] it's ridiculous uh how this how this
[50:46] goes. But basically the what I wanted to
[50:50] to get to is they are getting towards
[50:54] okay we have to not only save we also
[50:56] have to get new income and the only
[50:58] thing they always kind of get to is real
[51:01] estate because those are the only thing
[51:03] only um people that can not really get
[51:06] out of Austria like you cannot move a
[51:08] house in Vienna to Budabest you you can
[51:11] sell the house in Vienna and buy one in
[51:13] Budapest h companies can leave there's
[51:15] an exit tax but if If you if you
[51:17] increase the taxes on a company too
[51:19] high, they rather pay the exit tax and
[51:21] then move to another country. Bitcoin,
[51:24] they don't can they don't even know if
[51:27] where it is because it's not in any
[51:29] particular country. Um, stocks you can
[51:32] tax better because it's like in a in an
[51:35] brokerage. So like you you cannot get it
[51:37] out that quickly. So what are they
[51:40] taxing? Huh? Real estate. Almost
[51:42] everyone owns them. It's a huge source
[51:45] of income. if they just pump up the tax
[51:47] of like 0 0.5% it's a huge income for
[51:50] them most people will just buy them uh
[51:53] and someone that has a real estate
[51:56] property they will not sell it just
[51:58] because they raised at 0.5% but it will
[52:01] hurt him a lot financially so this is a
[52:04] this is a I think something real estate
[52:07] people also don't realize how easy it is
[52:10] to tax them yeah absolutely and they get
[52:13] scared because they live there and the
[52:16] government can put a lean on it, you
[52:17] know, and they can start collecting and
[52:19] they can have a judgment and, you know,
[52:22] there's all the liability. I mean,
[52:23] someone can trip on your property, they
[52:25] can fall in your swimming pool, you
[52:27] know, and suddenly you have a lawsuit,
[52:28] you know, that that no one can trip on
[52:30] my Bitcoin. I love that. Um, we we
[52:34] talked about why renting is better than
[52:36] owning a home, and I'm 100% there with
[52:38] you. Is there a time in the Bitcoin
[52:41] adoption where you say, "Oh, now it
[52:45] actually makes sense if it's a small
[52:47] small enough amount of your Bitcoin to
[52:51] own your own home again." So, let's say
[52:53] Bitcoin adoption is going not we are
[52:55] currently at like 3%, I think we're more
[52:58] like at 0.5%. Let's say we at 50 60% of
[53:01] Bitcoin adoption. We at like 10 20
[53:04] million. It's going really good. Is
[53:07] there an point where you say, "Oh, no."
[53:09] Like now we at the maturity level of
[53:11] Bitcoin adoption where maybe it makes
[53:13] sense to if you have the Bitcoin cash
[53:16] and you can buy with 10% of your Bitcoin
[53:19] portfolio a home that you really like.
[53:22] Is there a point where it makes sense
[53:24] again to invest in something else? Yeah,
[53:26] I think you know with the
[53:29] caveat that if people are willing again
[53:33] to admit that it will not be uh as good
[53:37] an investment as Bitcoin, whatever real
[53:39] estate you get, full stop, that you will
[53:41] lose in purchasing power against
[53:44] Bitcoin, if you're willing to admit
[53:45] that. And if you find a unique enough
[53:50] property that it happens to be in a
[53:53] place where you don't want to move for 5
[53:56] or 10 years like you because that is the
[53:59] one thing that ownership would do is
[54:00] like if you rent a landlord could force
[54:03] you out. He sells the property you have
[54:04] to move. So if for some reason it's
[54:07] unique enough that you're like look I
[54:08] really cannot live anywhere else in the
[54:10] world. I have to live here. like maybe
[54:13] it is a farm or it is a land and you're
[54:15] part of a business or something then I
[54:18] get it and then I would say yeah that
[54:21] could make sense for you to buy it. I
[54:24] also believe that to your question uh
[54:28] and this is right around the corner
[54:30] perhaps even later this year that as
[54:33] soon as we can have Bitcoin mortgages I
[54:38] think that'll be a gamecher meaning a
[54:40] way to not have to sell your Bitcoin.
[54:44] Let your Bitcoin continue to grow but
[54:47] take a loan off of your
[54:49] Bitcoin enough for a down payment on the
[54:52] house. So again, you're going to have
[54:54] more expenses because now you're in the
[54:55] fiat world and you're you're you're
[54:57] leveraging and there is risk. So you
[55:00] have to make sure you have enough
[55:01] Bitcoin that you can just have a small
[55:03] amount because you don't want to have a
[55:04] capital call, you don't want to have to
[55:06] have to add more or be liquidated. But,
[55:09] you know, for easy numbers, if you have
[55:11] 10 Bitcoin and you're getting a house
[55:13] for one Bitcoin,
[55:16] um, you know, yeah, that could make
[55:18] sense because you're not having to, you
[55:20] know, you're not having to sell all of
[55:22] your Bitcoin. You're just getting a
[55:24] Bitcoin loan based on the amount you
[55:26] have. Um, and the small amount of
[55:29] Bitcoin you probably would have to sell
[55:30] is for your down payment if you lived on
[55:31] a Bitcoin standard. If you still had a
[55:33] fiat job and you were saving some fiat,
[55:35] then sure, that could be your down
[55:36] payment. And then you don't have to sell
[55:38] any
[55:38] Bitcoin? None at all because you just
[55:41] get, you know, who wouldn't loan, you
[55:44] know, because there are some investors
[55:46] and some companies that still are
[55:47] fiat-minded and they want fixed income.
[55:50] So, just like all mortgages, all
[55:51] mortgages come from from fixed income
[55:53] investments. But why if I'm a fixed
[55:56] income investor and I want to make money
[55:59] off of someone else's mortgage, why not
[56:02] do it on Bitcoin that's perfect, you
[56:04] know, collateral versus a house that I
[56:08] have to appraise and there, you know, I
[56:11] have to worry about if this if my
[56:12] investment is going to be safe with
[56:14] that. But here, I can just digitally
[56:16] check an address. Here's the 10 Bitcoin
[56:18] this person put up. Great. Here's, you
[56:21] know, the $200,000 they need for the
[56:22] house. pay us back the $200,000 or not
[56:26] because we have your 10 Bitcoin, you
[56:28] know. So, there's that kind of thing.
[56:29] And with a multi- signature that makes
[56:31] it safe for everybody. So, you know, if
[56:34] I'm um a Bitcoiner and I want to borrow
[56:38] um off of my Bitcoin but not sell any, I
[56:40] want to know that I'm holding a key. You
[56:42] know, the lender can have a key and then
[56:44] a third party escrow attorney, agent,
[56:47] someone has a key. some kind of system
[56:49] where I know that no one can take my
[56:51] Bitcoin and as long as I pay off the
[56:53] loan, I get my Bitcoin back and if I
[56:55] don't, you know, I have my house.
[56:57] So, I do think it would make sense and I
[57:00] think those are coming. I know those are
[57:02] coming. Um uh yeah, you know, they're
[57:05] coming. Uh a lot of the these things are
[57:07] going to happen because if you don't
[57:08] have to sell Bitcoin, then sure, you can
[57:10] go you can go enjoy your life and do
[57:13] what you want. It it's it's selling the
[57:15] Bitcoin that I think is tough. And
[57:16] there's nothing, and by the way, I don't
[57:17] think there's anything wrong with
[57:18] spending spending Bitcoin. I mean,
[57:20] that's the whole point of it. Um, but I
[57:24] would hate to like, you know, I would
[57:26] hate to have 10 Bitcoin and spend six on
[57:28] a house and now I'm stuck with four and
[57:31] now I have six on on a house. And
[57:34] there's just so much risk and liability
[57:35] in that, I think.
[57:38] Man, it's it's a super controversial
[57:41] topic because at the one at the one
[57:43] point it's like you you don't want to
[57:46] sell your Bitcoin, but also I for
[57:50] example I operate on the 100% like
[57:52] almost 100% Bitcoin standard. I still
[57:54] have to use fiat where where I have to.
[57:57] So most of my income is already in
[57:58] Bitcoin. Um I pay one of my members
[58:01] already in Bitcoin. Maybe uh soon all of
[58:04] them as they watch more and more of the
[58:06] podcast they probably will also uh
[58:08] demand a bitcoin payment at some point.
[58:10] Uh so I I have like two cash flows. The
[58:12] one Cathro is is feared, feared in,
[58:15] feared out. And the other one is
[58:16] Bitcoin, Bitcoin in, Bitcoin out. And
[58:19] actually the Bitcoin in, Bitcoin out is
[58:20] is growing. And I also didn't use an
[58:24] Bitcoin exchange for like half a year
[58:26] now, something like that, because uh it
[58:29] it nicely balances itself um with the
[58:32] banks expenses. But it really made me
[58:34] realize that Bitcoin is money and we
[58:37] should use it. it. There's nothing wrong
[58:40] with spending your
[58:42] Bitcoin if you have only Bitcoin. Like
[58:46] you have to live. Yeah. You have to do
[58:50] something. The only thing is try to
[58:53] spend less than you make like make more
[58:56] Satoshi's each month than you spend and
[58:59] then you have a plus that this is saving
[59:00] like that. You you're using Bitcoin as
[59:02] it standard to use.
[59:05] Bitcoin is not this weird thing where
[59:07] you pay all your years in and then you
[59:10] die with the biggest stack ever. Yeah.
[59:13] The whole point of Bitcoin is that we
[59:15] can increase our purchasing power that
[59:16] we have more spending ability in the
[59:18] future. And so I think the narrative of
[59:20] never sell your Bitcoin is good. I've
[59:22] said that. But that is mostly I think
[59:24] and it should be if not directed at the
[59:27] people that aren't 100% there yet.
[59:29] They're putting 5% in Bitcoin. They're
[59:31] putting 2% in Bitcoin. Yes. for them.
[59:33] Never ever sell your Bitcoin. It'll help
[59:35] you so much. For us, cuz I'm just like
[59:38] you. I live mostly on a Bitcoin
[59:39] standard. I spend my Bitcoin all the
[59:41] time. I pay my bills in Bitcoin. I pay
[59:43] my dinners in Bitcoin. I have debit
[59:45] cards and stuff that that merchants
[59:46] don't even have to know. I agree. And I
[59:48] want I want to encourage people and when
[59:51] I can, and it's, you know, especially
[59:53] for gifts or whatever, you know, I love
[59:54] to give 12 words to people. I like to
[59:56] get that curiosity going like what is
[59:58] this? That's Bitcoin. What? How is it
[60:00] Bitcoin? Well, let's figure it out. you
[60:02] might have to download a wallet and
[60:03] punch them in and oh there there's some
[60:05] money and so I think yes it right if you
[60:09] break it down to its to its most basic
[60:12] fundamentals Bitcoin is for us
[60:15] to hold send and receive that's it so
[60:20] the sending and the receiving part we
[60:22] have to keep in
[60:23] mind you know because a lot of people
[60:25] are holding but you also have the send
[60:26] and receive part you have been in the
[60:28] real estate um community and in the
[60:31] Bitcoin
[60:32] community and uh one thing I just noted
[60:35] that down you you said um real estate
[60:38] people like to flex like oh I have that
[60:40] home I and this is my home and I own
[60:44] those five uh properties and stuff like
[60:46] that they they brag with that oh I have
[60:48] like 200 real estate uh properties in
[60:51] like five different countries in Bitcoin
[60:54] it's very different where if you say how
[60:57] many bitcoin you have you really get
[60:58] called out by the community of like oh
[61:00] like don't say that you make yourself
[61:02] vulnerable and like it's a very
[61:03] different community around that. Good
[61:06] point. Are there any other differences
[61:07] that you've noticed from the real estate
[61:09] community and Bitcoin community and
[61:11] which and what I'm really interested in
[61:13] is is there something we could learn
[61:15] from the real estate community that
[61:19] uh the Bitcoin community might not be as
[61:21] good in like what we could improve
[61:23] community-wise.
[61:25] That's a great question. I never thought
[61:26] about that. thinking in reverse. What
[61:28] could what could Bitcoiners learn from
[61:30] real estate people? Well, let me think
[61:32] about that. Let me come back to that.
[61:33] I'll I'll um respond to the first part
[61:36] that you said. You made me realize that,
[61:38] you know, when switching from real
[61:40] estate into Bitcoin, you you learn
[61:43] really what's important. You learn the
[61:45] reason we save. We learn that money is
[61:47] just the tool to get us what we need,
[61:50] right? So, you don't need to care about
[61:52] the real estate. And you learn about
[61:54] living your life with more fulfillment
[61:57] in that um we minimize our possessions.
[62:01] We don't need to be cluttered with lots
[62:04] of assets and owning lots of things. You
[62:07] know, anytime you buy something and
[62:09] especially real estate, and you know,
[62:11] real estate's one thing, but then you
[62:12] have to fill the real estate with stuff.
[62:14] You have to fill it with furniture and
[62:15] all this stuff. And you know, you're
[62:16] eventually having a flea market, garage
[62:19] market. You're hauling stuff to the
[62:20] storage unit. You're selling it on eBay.
[62:22] It's like, you know, possessions possess
[62:26] and Bitcoin teaches you that you can
[62:29] possess what's important, your time and
[62:31] energy, but without the possession,
[62:33] without the actual thing. And so, I
[62:36] think like for me, I I learned, and I
[62:38] think a lot of Bitcoiners probably have
[62:40] learned coming from wherever they came
[62:42] from and saving in Bitcoin, you can just
[62:45] minimize the distractions and the noise
[62:48] and focus on what's
[62:50] important. Um, now let me think about
[62:53] the opposite. What could a Bitcoiner
[62:55] learn from real estate people? I mean,
[62:57] real estate people in general can see
[63:02] the potential and promise of something
[63:05] um, early on. They're really good at
[63:08] saying, I know you have potential. I
[63:10] know you can be worth something. I know
[63:12] you can be valuable in the future, and
[63:15] I'm going to invest in you. And maybe
[63:18] with where Bitcoin is going and as
[63:20] Bitcoiners start to become more
[63:21] philanthropic and want to invest and
[63:24] build in businesses um you know contra
[63:26] not contrary to what Keynesian
[63:28] economists and the mo and the mainstream
[63:30] media say you know Bitcoiners do not
[63:31] want to just hoard their Bitcoin as it
[63:34] appreciates and grows they want to spend
[63:36] their Bitcoin and I think many of them
[63:38] will invest in things that they care
[63:39] about and um that maybe is something
[63:43] that you we can learn from from real
[63:45] estate people is that they are willing
[63:46] willing to roll up their sleeves and
[63:49] say, "I can see that this is a diamond
[63:51] in the rough. I know this this house has
[63:53] good bones. It just needs some paint and
[63:57] um a nice roof and it'll be good to go."
[64:00] Um and maybe some people that come into
[64:03] Bitcoin want their wallet to work
[64:06] perfectly and they want, you know, the
[64:09] the me the meool to be perfect and they
[64:11] want the mining to be perfect and it's
[64:13] like we still have some things to work
[64:15] out. we have some kinks like everything
[64:16] functions fine, everything is safe. Um,
[64:19] but there are ways things can be
[64:21] smoother for the user experience and
[64:24] maybe we just we maybe we the takeaway
[64:27] is that these things will improve. They
[64:28] will get better.
[64:30] Yeah, I think we we we're really good in
[64:33] the back end and and trying to make
[64:35] something work, but there are a lot of
[64:39] apps, a lot of things in Bitcoin where I
[64:43] just hope that we get better in the uh
[64:46] UX and the UI of things. And we lot of
[64:50] designing we we we have to make Bitcoin
[64:53] so good that people use it even though
[64:58] they disagree with Bitcoin because it's
[65:00] so nice to use. How many people are on
[65:03] Twitter and hate on Twitter every single
[65:05] day, but they use it every single day
[65:08] because it's so good so good to use.
[65:11] Bitcoin apps have to be so freaking good
[65:14] that people just love to use it. they
[65:16] they love to spend the Bitcoin with the
[65:18] Bitcoin apps because it's so such a
[65:20] great uh uh feeling. It's such a great
[65:23] experience on the app. So, uh I I think
[65:26] that's uh it gets better. Like if you
[65:29] think about how complicated this was to
[65:31] buy Bitcoin 10 years ago, how
[65:33] complicated it was 5 years ago, and how
[65:35] complicated it is now to buy Bitcoin and
[65:37] spend Bitcoin and all those things, like
[65:38] it gets really exponentially better. But
[65:41] we have a long way to go, especially
[65:42] with with spending and the medium of
[65:45] exchange side of things. Yeah. I mean,
[65:47] Bitcoin needs to get so good that
[65:49] unfortunately your podcast goes away.
[65:52] Like we no longer need to be educating,
[65:54] right? And it's almost like the
[65:56] internet. I feel like we went backwards
[65:58] in time like you know we're doing dialup
[66:00] and all this stuff and it's like no one
[66:02] thinks about how the internet works
[66:03] anymore because it's just beautiful. I
[66:04] said that uh I mean sometimes already in
[66:07] the podcast this was one of the reasons
[66:09] why I went away from the Bitcoin path.
[66:12] The the first and probably nobody knows
[66:15] that listen here but the first like five
[66:17] or 10 episodes were called the Bitcoin
[66:20] path. And then I was like but I think
[66:23] Bitcoin will be boring at some point.
[66:25] So, and I want to make this podcast a
[66:28] lifelong journey of me learning from
[66:30] great
[66:31] people. So, why I just me name it the
[66:36] one constant that will always be true in
[66:38] the podcast like me. I will always well
[66:41] like Peter McCormack, right? Yeah,
[66:43] exactly. He went he went out in in in
[66:46] the same direction and uh I I think it's
[66:49] great uh that that he did that. It's
[66:51] like really awesome to see. And I was
[66:54] having that realization after like five
[66:56] 10 episodes like no like I it should
[66:59] just be Robin. I I don't want to make a
[67:01] show out of it, sell it or like make
[67:03] investors like I I even got uh offers
[67:07] like I it's just my way of learning
[67:10] about the world and having a platform so
[67:13] other people can learn with me together.
[67:16] Now I'm solely focusing on Bitcoin. So
[67:19] maybe now it would be better for me if I
[67:21] call it something with
[67:23] Bitcoin. But maybe in 5 10 years it's a
[67:27] whole different topic and I'm really
[67:29] obsessed with a new topic. Then I have
[67:32] to rebrand and rename it. I guess it's
[67:34] possible. Peter McComic shows that it's
[67:36] possible. But this was the the reason
[67:39] why I I went with like just my name.
[67:42] Like that's the only constant that you
[67:43] can expect. Yeah. No, I get I mean, I
[67:47] was talking to some other Bitcoiners at
[67:48] a at a meetup the other day and it was
[67:51] like, you know, do you think about what
[67:53] we're all doing? Like where we know
[67:55] Bitcoin is going. We're we're not going
[67:58] to be having these conferences anymore.
[67:59] We're not going to be having all these
[68:00] podcasts. We're not going to be like
[68:02] because it like when's the last time you
[68:04] watched you when's the last time you
[68:05] went to the to the internet conference,
[68:08] you know, or watched an internet
[68:09] podcast, you know, you I don't even
[68:12] think it exists, but I'm sure those
[68:14] existed way back when, you know, I don't
[68:16] know. Um well, podcast didn't exist, but
[68:19] you know what I mean. Um conferences
[68:21] probably. It's also interesting
[68:24] if because internet conferences are no
[68:27] longer there like like pure internet
[68:30] conferences but there's like consumer
[68:31] products I I forgot how how there like
[68:34] really popular really big ones that are
[68:37] around the internet that use the
[68:39] internet. So maybe also and I don't know
[68:42] if if this will be the same case with
[68:44] Bitcoin, but maybe there's like
[68:46] conferences that use Bitcoin, not just
[68:49] as money obviously, but uh somehow the
[68:52] technology of it, but I don't know. I'm
[68:54] I'm not a big fan of things built on top
[68:56] of Bitcoin that are not money related.
[68:59] Uh but there could be like conferences
[69:02] or like niche things that like sprinkle
[69:05] out of Bitcoin but are not directly
[69:07] Bitcoin. And maybe we just move to
[69:10] citadels. Uh or the whole world is a
[69:12] citadel. It's the things we don't know
[69:14] about, right? Like when the internet
[69:16] came out, no one thought it would become
[69:19] a theater. No one thought it would
[69:20] become a dating app, uh you know, or a
[69:23] flea market, but it just did. So it's
[69:25] like we I we just don't know. Yeah.
[69:27] What's going to be built?
[69:29] You mentioned also cash flow. It's an a
[69:32] really interesting one because I think a
[69:34] lot of Bitcoin is also um crave cash
[69:37] flow uh from the Bitcoin holdings. How
[69:41] do you look at cash flow opportunities
[69:43] in Bitcoin like investing in mining uh
[69:47] investing uh in in in different
[69:50] investment uh how is that one called the
[69:52] MSTY or something like that? Not even
[69:56] not even available in Europe. So I did
[69:58] not check it out yet. Uh but there are
[70:00] different things where you can
[70:02] potentially generate some sort of income
[70:05] with of course additional risk. Yeah. I
[70:09] mean there's a lot of uh derivatives and
[70:11] synthetic products that are coming out
[70:12] and people are trying to uh get fancy
[70:15] and do things with Bitcoin and for for
[70:18] many sophisticated people and people
[70:19] that want to take the risk they can do
[70:20] that. um even the the the the developers
[70:25] and um platforms for any of these
[70:27] products, they'll tell you all of this
[70:29] is much more risky than just simply
[70:31] holding Bitcoin. Um because you can
[70:34] swing in either way. But as far as cash
[70:37] flow, all I would say is, you know, it's
[70:38] it you have cash flow with Bitcoin in
[70:41] that you can sell tiny fractions of
[70:45] Bitcoin. That is your cash flow because
[70:47] the the appreciation rate of Bitcoin is
[70:50] so great that as it goes up, you can
[70:52] take a slice here or take a slice and
[70:54] take it when you need it, not when you
[70:55] don't need it versus cash flow of real
[70:58] estate. And again, it's a capital gains
[71:01] on Bitcoin, not income tax as it is in
[71:05] real estate. So, I like to tell people,
[71:08] you know, like I was saying earlier that
[71:09] it's it's it's just a different form of
[71:12] appreciation and that there really is no
[71:14] c cash flow. Like even with the cash
[71:16] flow, you're you're cash flow like what
[71:18] does cash flow mean? It's like like I'm
[71:21] so I don't have enough money so I need
[71:23] cash right now to pay my bills, but yet
[71:26] you had enough money to buy the real
[71:27] estate in the first place to then just
[71:29] be getting fractions back. It's really
[71:31] weird to me, you know? So, in a sense,
[71:35] if you're doing the same with Bitcoin,
[71:36] you can just sell off tiny pieces if you
[71:39] need cash flow. I don't know if that
[71:41] really answered your question, but the
[71:42] problem is that I am not a Wall Street
[71:45] guy. I don't trade um you know, I don't
[71:47] own Microsoft and or any of these
[71:50] things. I think it's great some people
[71:52] have figured it out, but I also feel
[71:53] like uh a lot of those people might get
[71:56] wrecked. I don't know if they know what
[71:57] they're doing. I wouldn't know what to
[71:59] do to be honest. So, I'm probably the
[72:01] the wrong person to ask. Also, no
[72:04] Bitcoin mining.
[72:06] Well, um, so I I mean I like I mean I
[72:10] like I mean obviously I love Bitcoin
[72:12] miners. I love what they do. I support
[72:14] them. Um,
[72:16] but you know, if you're talking about
[72:18] investing in a stock, you know, like for
[72:20] the dividends of a minor, to me, that's
[72:22] just really risky. Um, I think if you
[72:26] can mine, fantastic. I wish I could
[72:28] mine, but I can't find cheap or
[72:31] discarded or wasted electricity over
[72:33] here. And so for me to plug into my
[72:34] wall, it's there's there's no way. Um I
[72:37] run a node, which I think is great. Um
[72:41] and I think solo mine, I do solo mine,
[72:43] but I don't consider that mining mining.
[72:45] And then that's great just to help
[72:46] decentralize, but it's it's such a small
[72:48] amount of hash rate that I don't think I
[72:50] even add to anything.
[72:53] That's Yeah, especially with ocean and
[72:55] like lightning payouts. It's it they
[72:57] they really made some some cool things
[72:59] there. Really cool. I have one question
[73:01] um that I asked each and every one of my
[73:03] guests and I think I introduced that
[73:05] after our last show. So probably
[73:07] something new for you. Um the question
[73:09] is what can we learn from you besides
[73:12] Bitcoin? Boy, I don't remember you
[73:13] asking me that question the first time
[73:15] we did a podcast. Was that is this this
[73:16] is the same question you always ask? Uh
[73:18] yes, but uh I introduced that question I
[73:21] think afterwards. So, um I think it's I
[73:25] I did not ask it the last time when you
[73:27] were around, so I introduced it
[73:29] somewhere along the last I don't know
[73:31] 200 episodes or something like that. So,
[73:34] what can you learn from me besides
[73:35] Bitcoin? Is that what you're asking?
[73:37] Yeah, exactly. So it's it's basically my
[73:40] try and then I I explain the intentions
[73:42] quickly uh because I think sometimes um
[73:46] I put that question in because we are
[73:51] talking with Bitcoiners around Bitcoin
[73:54] and with the same intention that I
[73:56] mentioned before why I did the the Robin
[73:59] Sire uh and not the the Bitcoin path
[74:02] naming. I think at some point Bitcoin
[74:05] will be boring and that's why I'm so
[74:08] interested in what else are Bitcoiners
[74:12] passionate about. What else are they
[74:15] really investigating, learning about um
[74:19] doing uh whatever it is some people say
[74:22] about family, some people say like some
[74:24] sports or some people say some random
[74:27] topic that they they are currently
[74:28] really going deep. Uh, and so I just
[74:32] want to get one aspect outside of
[74:34] Bitcoin in Well, I mean the the easy the
[74:38] lowhanging fruit for me is is um
[74:41] content. It's story. It's movies. It's
[74:45] videos.
[74:46] Um, you know, uh, I've made a lot of
[74:49] movies. I've made a lot of TV shows. And
[74:52] as I've migrated out of that into
[74:54] Bitcoin, I've brought a lot of the
[74:56] skills of writing and storytelling. And
[75:00] even though in movies and TVs, I never
[75:01] had to touch an editing machine. I, you
[75:03] know, I had people for all of that. I
[75:05] was, you know, the producer. I now am
[75:07] enjoying actually doing all the things
[75:09] that I never learned to do. But now
[75:12] we're in a world where everything's much
[75:14] more accessible. Um, we're in a very
[75:17] internetcon connected economy and and
[75:20] it's just very easy to reach an
[75:23] audience, it's very easy to educate,
[75:25] it's very easy to make people laugh,
[75:28] whatever you want to do. So,
[75:31] um, even with AI, no matter how big AI
[75:34] gets and
[75:35] whatnot, content will always be king.
[75:38] Story will always be important. people's
[75:40] personal stories are important whether
[75:42] they want to write books, whether they
[75:44] want to make videos, whether they want
[75:46] to make an independent movie, whatever.
[75:48] Um, I have a ton of experience in those
[75:50] areas and and those areas that I'm
[75:51] passionate about. I I I write every
[75:53] morning. I make a new video every two
[75:55] weeks. Um, I'm still developing several
[75:58] screenplays. Um, I'm still developing uh
[76:01] co-developing a movie company to to do a
[76:05] bunch more films. Like, I haven't said
[76:07] no to Hollywood. I've said no to the
[76:10] centralization and KYC aspect so to
[76:13] speak of Hollywood where now I just want
[76:15] to do things on my own terms. So, you
[76:18] know, if I can raise money and meet the
[76:20] right investors that are aligned with
[76:23] those values, I'm ready to jump back in
[76:26] and, you know, go make another 20
[76:27] movies. I love that. Yeah. I think I
[76:31] think on the last podcast and maybe I
[76:32] should uh quickly pull it up because I
[76:34] think last time we talked a lot about
[76:37] the movie side of things and uh
[76:39] storytelling and and Bitcoin. Um let me
[76:44] just quickly pull it up. I think that uh
[76:48] just for I don't think too much was
[76:50] similar but maybe No, it it was very uh
[76:53] it was a very different particles I
[76:55] think actually. Yeah. Uh so we shared
[76:57] different things. So if you just type in
[76:59] uh Terrence Michael and Robin Sire, it's
[77:01] literally the the the first uh thing
[77:04] that pops up. So if you want to hear
[77:06] more about the the both of us, uh there
[77:08] there you go. There's another hour.
[77:11] Perfect. And we we really dove dove deep
[77:14] into storytelling I think in Bitcoin if
[77:16] I remember correctly. It was almost a
[77:18] year ago, but something like that I
[77:21] remember. Yeah. Um, as you know, uh,
[77:23] this is I remember I did definitely last
[77:25] time our end routine where the previous
[77:27] guest is asking a question for the next
[77:29] guest without knowing who the next guest
[77:30] actually is. So, the previous guest
[77:32] asked you the question, what would be
[77:36] your one thing that would make you turn
[77:38] away from Bitcoin? Wow. What would be
[77:41] the one thing that would make me turn
[77:42] away from Bitcoin? Wow, that's a great
[77:44] question. I don't know if this is an
[77:46] acceptable answer, but because Bitcoin
[77:49] is a rules-based
[77:52] protocol, I I can't I don't even have
[77:56] the imagination to to see what could
[77:58] what is even possible to
[78:00] change because I would have to accept
[78:03] those changes with my node. And if I
[78:05] choose not to accept them, there are no
[78:08] changes. Um, so I'll use that as my
[78:11] answer that, you know, we can't change
[78:14] Bitcoin. It can only change us. And so I
[78:17] don't I don't know what could change.
[78:20] Maybe maybe I'm too limited in my
[78:22] thinking, but um I mean I think that is
[78:25] the big idea of Bitcoin is that it it
[78:27] can't it can't change in that
[78:30] respect. The only thing that can change
[78:32] is every node operator has to accept
[78:34] whatever changes they choose to accept,
[78:37] but you don't have to accept them.
[78:41] It it it's a it's a really tricky one.
[78:43] Honestly, the
[78:44] the might be a really I've watched a lot
[78:46] of your podcasts. That might be one of
[78:48] the best questions cuz cuz it stumped
[78:51] me, which is good. I I mean, I love
[78:52] questions that make you think. And I I
[78:54] want to think more about that, but I I
[78:57] because any of the things that I would
[78:58] would normally say in the fiat world,
[79:00] well, if this happens, if this happens,
[79:01] if this happens, just can't happen.
[79:04] So yeah, that's a good one. There's
[79:07] there's one thing uh and this is like
[79:10] very out of the ordinary. It's very
[79:13] almost it's not impossible, but it's
[79:15] something
[79:17] uh it's a black
[79:19] swan. If aliens, if something comes to
[79:23] us that is clearly superior and if
[79:26] something comes to us and they they
[79:27] probably are superior to us because they
[79:29] discovered us and not we them. um and
[79:32] they have their own monetary system.
[79:36] They could force their monetary system
[79:39] probably onto us which makes us probably
[79:43] um uh dump our Bitcoin. This is
[79:47] the till now actually my best try at
[79:51] what could go wrong with Bitcoin and
[79:53] alien force is forcing us to to use
[79:55] their currencies and even then I'm like
[79:59] I don't know if they really have because
[80:01] we also have now have different
[80:03] countries but yeah like you have to go
[80:06] they have to take over the whole world
[80:08] right and exactly cut all of us off the
[80:11] they have to be really a lot of people
[80:14] or like a lot of whatever or they they
[80:16] call themselves and they have to be
[80:18] really superior to bit to humans which I
[80:21] don't think is
[80:23] impossible but then it's so outlandish
[80:26] that you you you cannot like there's
[80:30] nothing to prepare for that one anyway
[80:32] so like you you might as well just stick
[80:34] with Bitcoin. Yeah, that's a good one.
[80:36] I'll accept that. I'll accept asteroids
[80:38] or aliens or any of that because to me
[80:40] that's so far-fetched. That that works.
[80:42] That's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. Really
[80:44] cool. Thank you so much, Terren, for for
[80:46] for being on. Uh, before I let you go,
[80:49] where can people find you, ask you
[80:50] questions, and reach out to you? X is
[80:53] the best place, of course, X Twitter,
[80:55] just proof of money. Um, I'm I'm there
[80:58] all day long and um doing a spaces every
[81:01] morning, 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. um for
[81:03] 2 hours. Um Monday through Friday, we do
[81:06] a big Bitcoin today spaces with a lot of
[81:08] Bitcoiners, and it's a lot of fun. So,
[81:11] um, they can they can find me and and
[81:13] everybody else there. And I'm also still
[81:15] as the Bitcoin adviser, so I can help
[81:17] anybody with the multisig setups with
[81:19] their wallets and inheritance solutions.
[81:21] So, really cool. Thank you so much for
[81:23] taking the time, Terren. And also, thank
[81:25] you so much for everyone that is
[81:26] watching and listening for joining us
[81:28] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[81:30] with another show. Bye-bye. Oh, man.
[81:32] Today I I said show, not episode.
[81:39] [Music]
