[00:00] shot 256 is the best asset protection
[00:02] mechanism there is yes your money are in
[00:04] cyber space you are not there yet you're
[00:06] right here in a physical presentence if
[00:08] you want to protect your family you want
[00:11] to be able to have a plan B a second
[00:13] home in case of emergency Bitcoin is one
[00:16] of the main Flags in the flag Theory
[00:19] they hope to never have to use it but
[00:22] they just sleep better at night knowing
[00:23] that civil unrest comes in geopolitical
[00:26]  happens that involves their
[00:27] country they're out and they have a
[00:29] place a safe place for the family
[00:31] Americans Canadians Europeans are
[00:33] interested in Turkey because it's
[00:35] outside of the EU it doesn't share all
[00:37] the information on the citizen with
[00:39] whoever need it my definition of flag
[00:41] theory is basically to limit your
[00:43] dependency on any one particular State
[00:46] while obtaining a second third and
[00:48] fourth flag Portugal is interesting for
[00:51] bitcoiners specifically because they
[00:52] have this investment option where you
[00:54] invest in a fund the fund basically just
[00:57] holds Bitcoin ETFs and you get red gold
[01:00] Visa first and then apply for
[01:01] citizenship so you can get a Portugal
[01:03] citizenship while holding Bitcoin there
[01:05] is a new trend right now in the US and
[01:08] Canada to move to Latin America with
[01:10] remote jobs they just realize their
[01:12] salary will give them an amazing
[01:15] lifestyle let's say in Mexico which is
[01:17] just 3 hours flight from their Hometown
[01:19] IRS is not the only one basically every
[01:21] threel agency can revoke your passports
[01:24] now countries do realize that they have
[01:26] to actually compete for the citizens not
[01:28] specifically for citizens in but for the
[01:31] capital and for the fruits of our
[01:33] [Music]
[01:36] labor it's an interesting topic and I
[01:38] think a topic that gets gets more and
[01:41] more uh popular um it's about Plan B and
[01:45] passports first of all like what what is
[01:48] Plan B because I actually didn't knew
[01:50] that like a half a year ago so maybe a
[01:52] lot of people are also like what's Plan
[01:54] B and why should we get a plan B yeah
[01:57] originally I was an immigrant myself and
[02:00] once I moved to the United States I
[02:01] realized that having a second passport
[02:04] or second residency really benefits me
[02:07] in a way that I now have optionality to
[02:10] which passport to use in which situation
[02:13] so having an optionality is always about
[02:15] Freedom having a second option having an
[02:18] insurance policy a hedge against your
[02:21] main government Homeland um that's what
[02:24] the plan B is so plan B passport is a
[02:27] company I founded 5 years ago where we
[02:29] help bitcoiners all over the world to
[02:31] obtain a second citizenship or second
[02:33] residency for their benefits I basically
[02:37] build this company on the concept of
[02:39] flag Theory and my definition of flag
[02:42] theory is basically to limit your
[02:45] dependency on any one particular State
[02:48] why while obtaining a second third and
[02:51] fourth Flags right and by Flags I mean
[02:55] citizenship residency driver license
[02:57] sometimes bank account sometimes legal
[02:59] entity though the flags can be different
[03:02] um it's like a custom tailored security
[03:05] model called flag Theory ah really
[03:09] interesting because of Bitcoin podcast I
[03:11] want to have like in the beginning one
[03:12] Bitcoin question that is kind of getting
[03:14] into that I feel like Bitcoin makes a
[03:16] lot of things easier for people to move
[03:19] around in the world and makes a little
[03:20] bit more brings more sovereignty to your
[03:23] life does Bitcoin then make Plan B a
[03:26] little bit less relevant for for people
[03:29] that are in bit coin because they have
[03:31] the option to like move around better
[03:34] yeah Bitcoin definitely has changed the
[03:36] game of jurisdictional Arbitrage the
[03:39] game of flag Theory much easier right
[03:42] most of the flag Theory stuff used like
[03:45] 30 years back was done for the sake of
[03:48] asset protection right so we have this
[03:52] structures to protect our assets where
[03:54] we create a trust the trust is created
[03:57] by three legal entities on an offshore
[03:59] island and those offshore um legal
[04:03] entities now hold some Assets in the
[04:06] local bank but now we have a way better
[04:09] asset protection mechanism 12 warts
[04:12] right here and it's like shot 256 is the
[04:15] best asset protection mechanism there is
[04:18] so of course it changed the game a lot I
[04:21] think Bitcoin is one of the main Flags
[04:23] in the flag Theory um toolbox right now
[04:28] but I still see the necessity and the
[04:31] need for like I mean yes your money are
[04:34] in cyers space you not there yet you're
[04:38] right here in a physical presence and if
[04:41] you want to protect your family um you
[04:44] want to be able to have a plan B a
[04:47] second second home in case of emergency
[04:50] that's where physical Plan B comes into
[04:52] place and of course like not many people
[04:54] are willing to relocate away from their
[04:57] home country they do get the second
[05:00] citizenship and residency and for them
[05:01] it's truly a plan B they hope to never
[05:04] have to use it but they just sleep
[05:07] better at night knowing that civil
[05:09] unrest comes in geopolitical
[05:12] happens that involves their country
[05:14] they're out and they have a place a safe
[05:16] place for the family on the other hand
[05:18] there are a lot of people who already
[05:20] feel like their home country
[05:22] jurisdiction is not does not suit them
[05:25] well so they think that either the local
[05:28] government is a little crazy culturally
[05:31] they don't feel like they fit so they're
[05:34] looking for actual relocation and
[05:36] obviously we help with that too uh we
[05:38] see what bitcoiners want and we provide
[05:40] the services that they desire so um
[05:44] that's what we do is there something the
[05:47] main reason asset protection as you said
[05:50] but the second reason as you said like
[05:52] there's some craziness in in your own
[05:54] country and your jurisdiction going on
[05:56] uh basically the fear of maybe Civil War
[05:59] the fear of some crazy laws of of
[06:02] something some monitoring law or
[06:04] something like that uh is is that the
[06:07] the main reason why why people want that
[06:09] or maybe even like also like tax
[06:11] advantages or other things like are
[06:12] there other things to consider yeah so
[06:15] all the thing you mentioned are very
[06:17] common now again flag theory is a
[06:20] security model and just like with every
[06:22] security model it's Custom Tailor like
[06:24] when it comes to bitcoin security like
[06:27] Michael sailor has somebody customing
[06:29] their points because that's what suits
[06:31] him if you ask me it's a terrible way to
[06:33] do that for my family and for anybody
[06:36] else right we are the self- custody
[06:38] Advocates now when it comes to self-
[06:39] custody you can have a hardware wallet
[06:41] you can have a a seed plate and like
[06:44] there's so many options and you have to
[06:46] find the one that suits you best based
[06:48] on things like okay how do I figure out
[06:51] inheritance uh I need to make sure my
[06:53] family can have the coins if I die I
[06:56] need to make sure that I can travel to
[06:58] 30 countries in the next year and not
[07:01] lose my keys you know like depending on
[07:03] your goals and needs you will navigate
[07:06] what security system needs to be in
[07:07] place same goes for Flack Theory right
[07:11] depending on okay are you a single dude
[07:14] um who got into Bitcoin early and that's
[07:17] like that's your attack Vector right
[07:20] like you think this is where the fear
[07:21] should be so based on your attack
[07:24] vectors and your needs you figure out
[07:26] what suits you now let's say you family
[07:28] with six kids and you're really not
[07:30] planning to relocate but you need to
[07:32] make sure that it's if something happens
[07:34] you get out it's a completely different
[07:36] thing um so yes tax like decreasing the
[07:41] capital gain tax that you know will
[07:43] happen in the future is one thing some
[07:46] people come with very weak passports so
[07:48] let's say South African passport
[07:50] extremely weak you can't travel anywhere
[07:52] you can't go to Europe you can go to the
[07:55] states not all of Latin America so you
[07:57] just want a a stronger
[08:00] document so you get a document that has
[08:02] Visa free access to 150
[08:05] countries um the safety issue again
[08:07] let's talk about South Africa people are
[08:10] just running out of there due to safety
[08:13] concerns in that scenario you just
[08:15] choosing the country whose lifestyle
[08:17] suits you and your family and trying to
[08:19] get your residency or citizenship there
[08:21] so depending on goals and needs there
[08:24] are different solutions um but yeah
[08:27] taxes Plan B um Family Security fullon
[08:32] relocation for
[08:34] opportunities um cultural need like
[08:38] right now cultural need but I mean bunch
[08:40] of bitcoiners want to move to El
[08:41] Salvador because El Salvador is into
[08:43] Bitcoin so that's one thing as
[08:46] well H how do you require another
[08:50] residency or another legal status
[08:53] somewhere yeah so there are multiple
[08:56] ways in which you can obtain citizenship
[08:58] or resident
[09:00] when it comes to citizenship let's talk
[09:01] about the biggest one so citizenship by
[09:04] investment that's our specialty that
[09:06] will be queers one they want they don't
[09:08] want to relocate they just want to
[09:10] invest or donate money to the state
[09:12] never visit the country get their
[09:14] passport they're all set easy
[09:17] straightforward in eight months you have
[09:19] the passport uh the paperwork is we take
[09:22] care of all the paperwork so not much on
[09:25] you second option let's say you have um
[09:28] roots ancestors from somewhere right
[09:31] that that is very relevant for Americans
[09:34] they most of them like half of them have
[09:37] European Roots so they're like okay my
[09:39] grandpa was born in Ireland I'm going to
[09:41] get an Irish passport or my mom is from
[09:45] Spain and something like this that's a
[09:47] second one um it's called citizenship by
[09:50] descent we provide those Services as
[09:52] well the Third Way is through
[09:55] naturalization you actually obtain a
[09:57] residency through one of the ways it
[09:58] could be marrying a local getting a job
[10:01] in the country there's also Sol uh
[10:04] Financial solvency programs where you
[10:06] basically say hey I make money broad I
[10:09] make enough money to cover all my
[10:11] expenses in the country and they have
[10:13] usually a certain threshold based on
[10:15] which you are able to obtain The
[10:17] Residency so you get a residency you
[10:19] leave there for five years you get the
[10:21] citizenship so those are basically the
[10:24] three common ways of obtaining a
[10:26] citizenship AKA passport of another
[10:28] country with residency as I mentioned
[10:30] there are so many ways every country has
[10:33] different immigration policies um
[10:36] starting from like being a student
[10:38] starting a business getting employed
[10:40] marrying a local citizen financial
[10:43] solvency investing in real estate all
[10:45] kinds of things different Pro different
[10:47] countries different jurisdictions
[10:49] different um immigration programs and
[10:52] again that's where we come into play you
[10:53] let us know where you want to go we
[10:55] probably already sent somebody there
[10:56] before had a lot of interesting
[10:58] questions for me India um maybe let's go
[11:01] first in like where do the most people
[11:04] want to go and like why like what are
[11:07] like the top destinations where people
[11:09] really like obviously Bitcoin nowadays
[11:11] want to go to El Salvador but like in in
[11:14] general like what are some of the the
[11:16] top
[11:17] places yeah definitely Caribbean islands
[11:20] offshore Caribbean jurisdictions are
[11:23] still top of the citizenship by
[11:25] investment um offerings because
[11:29] year processing you don't have to visit
[11:31] the island you don't have to leave on
[11:33] the island the process is very
[11:34] straightforward the program's been
[11:36] around for decades and all you do is you
[11:38] donate $200,000 to the local government
[11:41] or you buy some bonds or you buy some
[11:43] real estate on the island and on this
[11:46] basis you obtain citizenship the
[11:48] paperwork the due diligence is very
[11:51] thorough like they go through all your
[11:53]  quite
[11:55] diligently um but it's like those
[11:58] programs are well known the passport is
[12:00] very powerful the islands have zero
[12:02] capital gains tax zero Global income tax
[12:05] um you apply remotely and the majority
[12:09] of the funds you pay at the very end
[12:11] when you already know that you got
[12:12] approved let's say so it's like a safe
[12:15] bet everybody's like thousands of people
[12:18] done it before those passports work uh
[12:21] the programs are like everybody knows of
[12:24] those programs so they they they've gone
[12:27] through the time to prove themselves
[12:29] let's say that uh that would be top one
[12:32] then we have uh let's say turkey and the
[12:36] reason people want turkey is because
[12:37] usually turkey is on the other side of
[12:39] political Spectrum from where they are
[12:42] so if you think that your country is
[12:45] going downhill you want to see you want
[12:49] to get a passport from a country that is
[12:51] clearly not in bad with your hom state
[12:53] government because then they're
[12:55] culturally the same uh in terms of
[12:57] governmental opinion and the Direction
[12:59] they go to probably the same so
[13:01] Americans Canadians Europeans are
[13:04] interested in Turkey because it's
[13:05] outside of the EU it doesn't share all
[13:08] the information on the citizen with
[13:10] whoever with whoever need it so turkey
[13:13] is also interesting because the
[13:15] citizenship um is obtained based on real
[13:18] estate investment so you buy a two three
[13:20] bedroom apartment you get citizenship in
[13:23] a 7 months period and 3 years later you
[13:27] can sell that real estate us usually the
[13:29] real estate does pretty well I mean
[13:31] compared to bitcoin probably not but
[13:34] compared to Fiat probably yes um so
[13:38] turkey would be another one and now
[13:40] Portugal um is interesting for
[13:42] bitcoiners specifically because they
[13:44] have this investment option where you
[13:46] invest in a fund the fund basically just
[13:49] holds Bitcoin ETF so you give up self-
[13:52] custody but you still have price
[13:54] exposure and you get red golden Visa
[13:57] first and then apply for citizenship so
[13:59] so you can get p Portugal citizenship
[14:01] while quote unquote holding
[14:05] Bitcoin that's interesting uh that's
[14:07] that's like the probably the closest
[14:09] thing that bitcoiners want they they
[14:10] want exposure to bitcoin exactly and
[14:13] then of course we have El Salvador El
[14:16] Salvador has interesting programs in
[14:18] place right now specifically catered to
[14:21] our audience because we are the ones
[14:23] moving there so um I'm I'm pretty
[14:27] bullish on Salvador
[14:29] it's really interest it's also um it's
[14:32] something that seems to be quite
[14:34] expensive when we talk about 200,000
[14:36] 300,000 uh uh Investments is is there is
[14:41] there the possibility for someone that
[14:43] is like barely scrapping by and like can
[14:45] save a little bit of money and what are
[14:47] the options of of someone like can
[14:49] relocate in an area uh where like I
[14:52] don't know he he lives somewhere and he
[14:53] wants to relocate some somewhere else um
[14:57] what are the options for him there is a
[14:59] new trend right now in the US and Canada
[15:02] to move to Latin America with remote job
[15:05] so those people leave paycheck to
[15:07] paycheck but they make money in US
[15:08] Dollars now they move to Latin America
[15:11] and they spend money in pesos uh and the
[15:14] L like the dollar goes way further down
[15:16] there so they don't have savings they
[15:19] just leave paycheck to paycheck but
[15:21] because of the I mean difference in the
[15:26] salaries between jurisdictions it's
[15:28] again it it's a play of jurisdictional
[15:30] Arbitrage in a way too um they just
[15:32] realize their salary will give them an
[15:35] amazing lifestyle let's say in Mexico
[15:38] which is just three hours flight from
[15:40] their Hometown but now they can live in
[15:43] a penthouse and eat out every day and
[15:46] still make some savings so that's always
[15:49] an option and yeah I specifically talk
[15:51] about citizenship by investment let's
[15:53] say um you give up 200k but um you do it
[15:59] because you don't want to relocate you
[16:00] don't want any of this 5year weight
[16:03] period you just want to have a passport
[16:05] by the end of the year and that's what
[16:06] you buy that's why people are willing to
[16:08] do that is that possible for everyone
[16:12] like no matter what what passport they
[16:14] they have to bending in like they don't
[16:16] have any criminal records they like
[16:18] normal person they are not like Edwards
[16:20] not or something like that they they
[16:22] just like uh if they had have the money
[16:24] they can do it there are some countries
[16:27] that are currently banned in certain C
[16:29] jurisdiction certain programs for
[16:31] example with citizenship by citizenship
[16:33] by investment in the Caribbeans Russia
[16:35] is currently banned um also I believe
[16:39] Iran Iraq North Korea maybe Cuba from
[16:43] the top of my head I don't remember but
[16:45] yeah there are some jurisdictions that
[16:46] currently cannot apply um but yeah based
[16:51] like usually the client comes to me and
[16:53] I look into where they coming from what
[16:55] their goals and needs are so we can
[16:57] choose together the jurisdiction
[16:59] that will meet their goals but also that
[17:03] is feasible for them uh feasible in
[17:07] terms of price feasible in terms of the
[17:09] effort they have to put in order to
[17:11] obtain this citizenship um so that's the
[17:15] customization of the
[17:17] process that seems to be a alleged use
[17:20] Cas actually for because uh like for
[17:23] example Russia is now banned uh maybe in
[17:26] a few years your countries in the future
[17:29] banned for for something like that so
[17:30] like that's like a really good argument
[17:32] for for someone to get it before they
[17:35] need it it's like all with Bitcoin you
[17:37] want Bitcoin before your UH dollar is
[17:39] completely devalued like that's an
[17:41] interesting argument really really
[17:43] interesting there's also this concept of
[17:46] strong and weak passports and I never
[17:49] thought about that before I met my you
[17:51] must have a strong passport yeah exactly
[17:54] yeah I I I never thought about that
[17:56] before I met my Indian girlfriend uh and
[18:00] for her this was a a really big topic
[18:04] and I have an Austrian passport so like
[18:06] I basically can travel everywhere and I
[18:08] don't have to to deal with like waiting
[18:10] periods and and like get actually apply
[18:13] to travel somewhere that that concept
[18:15] was so foreign for me like I never
[18:16] thought about that in my life but that's
[18:19] a that's a real thing like the passports
[18:21] are strong and weak and it matters where
[18:23] you're actually coming from absolutely
[18:26] and I've learned it firsthand and raced
[18:29] in Russia I was on a Russian national
[18:32] team and every time I had to go for like
[18:35] a world championship European
[18:36] Championship we would have to send our
[18:38] passport to the Embassy provide them
[18:41] with uh airplane tickets hotel
[18:43] reservations everything must be paid for
[18:46] already otherwise you just won't get
[18:48] this visa and I've been denied for Visa
[18:50] so many times imagine a 14-year-old girl
[18:54] is flying to Switzerland for a Europe
[18:56] Cup like
[18:59] is she a threat to the country probably
[19:01] not is she going to stay by herself and
[19:04] be an illegal immigrant at 14 probably
[19:06] not does she have a good reason to go
[19:09] yes and I get denied I've been denied
[19:11] for visus my whole childhood and that's
[19:14] probably one of the reasons I'm doing
[19:16] this business too because I've seen
[19:18] firsthand the pain of it um yeah I
[19:22] usually say that my childhood really
[19:23] prepared me to be a big winner and a
[19:25] passport girl because I mean seeing
[19:27] Russian hyper inflation having my bank
[19:30] account Frozen having my visas denied my
[19:33] whole childhood I'm like okay let's go
[19:35] guys we got to Sol all that that's
[19:37] really interesting um maybe my case is
[19:40] also interesting for some people that
[19:42] are listening because I know that most
[19:45] of the people that listening to the
[19:46] podcast are from the United States uh
[19:49] from Canada from the UK from from
[19:53] countries that are that have quite good
[19:56] passports uh like the those like most of
[19:59] the countries obviously there are from
[20:01] all around the world but like the the
[20:02] big portions are from like the the uh
[20:05] those countries um what can I think more
[20:10] um what can they like for me it's also
[20:13] interesting for Austria like let's do
[20:14] this first um I know that when I have a
[20:19] second passport I probably lose my
[20:21] Austin one I think that's like a there's
[20:23] like a rule towards that what what can
[20:25] we do if if there's like you have a
[20:27] passport and your country doesn't allow
[20:29] a second passport yeah um so very few
[20:34] countries in the world actually prohibit
[20:36] having dual citizenship you just got
[20:39] lucky uh India actually would be another
[20:41] one um so Indian citizens whose country
[20:45] do not allow dual citizenship but their
[20:48] passport is weak they're just willing to
[20:50] let it go they usually obtain a second
[20:52] citizenship elsewhere they live in the
[20:55] US they have a Caribbean passport they
[20:58] just keep their there's the special
[21:01] status for Indians who left India and
[21:03] don't have the passport anymore that
[21:04] they still can come and spend a lot of
[21:06] time there are no problems so they're
[21:08] just willing to let it go in your case
[21:11] you do have a very strong passport and
[21:13] it's just the strategizing like if you
[21:17] want to leave an asra for the rest of
[21:18] your life probably just keep it and make
[21:20] sure you have a residency elsewhere to
[21:22] at least mitigate some risks but yeah
[21:25] you you can't really have dual triple
[21:27] citizenship
[21:29] as for America UK Canada you can have
[21:33] seven if you watch my podcast already
[21:35] for more than two times you know how
[21:37] extremely passionate I am about self-
[21:40] custody and the first very very very
[21:43] important step to self- cust is always
[21:46] getting yourself a hardware wallet and I
[21:49] have one for you here this is the
[21:51] Bitcoin only Edition from the bitbox my
[21:55] favorite single signature Hardware
[21:57] wallet on the market another really
[21:59] important piece of self- custody if you
[22:02] have a hardware wallet is the backup of
[22:05] the seat phrase and bitbox made the
[22:07] perfect solution to back up your seat
[22:10] phas they made a reusable steel wallet
[22:13] check out that beauty it's durable and
[22:16] extremely heavy if I put it on the desk
[22:19] I seriously fear for my own table it's
[22:22] so so heavy and durable I love it this
[22:25] is where my seed phrase is sec here go
[22:29] to bitbox Doss slobin to get your bitbox
[22:34] and if you use code Robin you even get
[22:37] 5% off of your complete order and the
[22:41] next step is to really level up your
[22:43] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[22:46] have the most secure self custody setup
[22:49] you have to secure your own devices you
[22:52] have to protect your privacy you have to
[22:54] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[22:57] on where you live you even want to have
[23:00] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[23:02] move in case something goes really
[23:04] really wrong and through all those steps
[23:06] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[23:09] step by step and if you visit the
[23:12] Bitcoin way.com
[23:13] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[23:16] minute free call to find out how you can
[23:19] level up your sovereignty and last but
[23:22] not least I have something completely
[23:24] new for you guys I partnered up with
[23:28] coin vigilante this is the most
[23:30] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[23:33] saw created by anyone look at that
[23:36] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[23:39] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[23:42] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[23:45] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[23:48] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[23:51] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[23:54] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[23:58] watch collections you have the date of
[24:00] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[24:03] there and of course also the block
[24:05] height and which EPO we are currently in
[24:09] I love the level of detail they put in
[24:12] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[24:14] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[24:17] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[24:20] love those watches so so much and what's
[24:23] the difference uh residency and and
[24:25] citizenship because like I can get uh a
[24:28] second residency which means I have to
[24:32] have a house there or like how still
[24:34] working so residency permit is basically
[24:38] usually it's a residency card or
[24:40] something like this in most countries it
[24:42] residency is a permit for you to leave
[24:44] and sometimes work in a country like a
[24:47] citizen you still have limited rights
[24:49] you can't vote usually but you can buy
[24:51] real estate you can have local bank
[24:53] accounts so you can reside in a country
[24:57] but you don't have travel Document that
[24:59] will get you across borders this is just
[25:01] a permit for you to live in a country
[25:04] basically the citizenship comes with a
[25:07] passport right so now you have full
[25:09] citizen rights you have a travel
[25:11] Document of this country um that's
[25:14] that's the biggest difference and
[25:16] distinct like it's huge difference
[25:18] between residency and citizenship yes
[25:20] residency will keep you safe in a
[25:22] different country in the moment you need
[25:24] it but let's say you like in the US for
[25:28] example example an IRS the tax um tax
[25:32] office of the United States can revoke
[25:35] your passport if you didn't pay taxes so
[25:37] now you're stuck in a country you can't
[25:39] leave no matter what and IRS is not the
[25:42] only one basically every threel agency
[25:44] can revoke your passport so in case of
[25:47] civil unrest in the country they
[25:48] probably going to close the borders
[25:50] revoke like say everybody's American
[25:52] passport does not have a power you can't
[25:54] leave so in this scenario you want to
[25:56] have another passport that you can just
[25:57] use to the border and get the out a
[26:00] big difference so you cannot do that
[26:02] with residen you can get cannot get the
[26:04] cross borders yeah
[26:06] exactly so you still need the the austan
[26:09] passports to to get like a and this was
[26:11] my my situation because I really was
[26:13] looking into that like the last few
[26:14] months and I was like oh I would like to
[26:17] get like uh in the future maybe a second
[26:19] passport I I feel comfortable in Austria
[26:21] uh but giving up the home Austrian uh
[26:24] passport is a big thing uh and
[26:27] especially if it's a already a good one
[26:29] and like you you kind of have a kind of
[26:31] have to make a downgrade for that I'm
[26:33] pretty sure like in Europe they started
[26:36] to allow more and more dual citizenship
[26:39] like Germany was the big one before but
[26:41] now they have exceptions so the EU is
[26:45] starting to move towards okay dual
[26:46] citizenship is fine so maybe in 10 years
[26:50] I hope I hope I'm young I'm 25 was a lot
[26:53] of life in front of me I I hope I hope
[26:55] so um uh let's talk about uh Bitcoin
[27:00] when did it made uh sense for you you
[27:02] talked about before that you had
[27:04] inflation uh when you were in Russia
[27:07] already so like you were pred prepped
[27:09] for being someone in Bitcoin when did
[27:12] you make uh when made it click for you
[27:14] so philosophically I feel like most
[27:16] Russians are prepared to be bit winners
[27:20] like they understand the radical
[27:23] ownership that is necessary for an asset
[27:25] because their assets has been seized
[27:27] before they understand inflation very
[27:30] well because we had a couple of
[27:31] hyperinflations in the last 20 years we
[27:35] just seen our currency lose 50% of value
[27:38] When The War Russian Ukrainian War
[27:40] started so we understand it very well
[27:43] now it's only the matter of learning
[27:46] enough about Bitcoin to realize it is
[27:48] the solution so for me um it was just
[27:53] very condential I was in the right place
[27:56] at the right time um and I just I was
[27:59] learning English just moved to the
[28:00] United States it's 2017 I'm going to
[28:03] every Meetup possible and I'm starting
[28:05] to happened to be at like Bitcoin
[28:08] meetups and some small conferences
[28:10] around um and at some point it just
[28:13] clicked like it all it sounded good
[28:15] right away because people called it
[28:17] Freedom money and I was like okay
[28:20] explain me more and the first book I've
[28:22] read was Antonopoulos mastering Bitcoin
[28:25] which was extremely hard for me it was
[28:27] in the foreign language I barely spoke
[28:29] English back then uh it was also pretty
[28:32] technical we didn't have the we didn't
[28:35] have um the Bitcoin standard yes yet
[28:38] which is more into like economics and
[28:41] philosophy we had mastering Bitcoin
[28:43] which is Bob sends Alice this is the
[28:46] hash this is and you're like okay guys
[28:49] but it did click at some point and of
[28:52] course it's like a process of thousands
[28:55] of clicks because you feel like you
[28:57] understand Bitcoin and then another
[29:00] moment happens you're like whoa it's
[29:01] even cooler than I thought um but yeah
[29:04] it I was just prepared to be a Bitcoin
[29:07] and it was only a matter of time until I
[29:09] figure it out how do you see the the the
[29:12] future of all that it's like
[29:14] citizenships are are easier and easier
[29:16] to to get when we get more and more the
[29:20] the possibility to travel around the
[29:23] world seems to be more connected now
[29:25] with money we have a really nice device
[29:27] for just like using as a bank account
[29:30] and you can literally go in every
[29:32] country and exchange your Bitcoin for
[29:35] local currency and buy everything you
[29:36] want do we need in the in the is is
[29:38] there a possibility that we can just
[29:40] like live on earth and and we we really
[29:43] are free and we can just move around
[29:45] more and those those those those kind of
[29:48] artificial borders and this artificial
[29:51] um barriers are not there as as much
[29:56] yeah um if you at sovereign individual
[29:59] book it talks a lot about the end of
[30:01] nation states specifically through this
[30:03] concept of um competition between n
[30:06] nation states so it used to be that
[30:09] you're born in a single country the
[30:12] country has Monopoly over you because
[30:14] you only have one passport you also
[30:17] attached to local jobs um you are
[30:20] limited by the language so mostly you
[30:23] would you would be born and stayed in
[30:25] the same country for the rest of your
[30:26] life even 15 years ago only 3% of people
[30:31] around the world would live in a country
[30:33] that they were not born in which mean
[30:35] it's crazy it's only 3% meaning that
[30:39] 97% Monopoly over you so if we look into
[30:44] what happened through Co people realize
[30:46] that they're no longer attached to their
[30:47] jobs locally they can pick up their
[30:50] things go anywhere and work remotely
[30:52] that was a really big thing uh the the
[30:55] nomadism right the digital Nomad concept
[30:58] that was a big spike in that and now
[31:00] countries do realize that they have to
[31:03] actually compete for the citizens not
[31:05] specifically for Citizens itself but for
[31:07] the capital and for the fruits of our
[31:09] labor so now if we can pick and choose
[31:13] which state provider we want to use
[31:16] where we want to leave they will have to
[31:19] compete for our attention so how do they
[31:21] compete with taxes with cultural um
[31:25] movements right so like El Salvador just
[31:27] just said no income tax for any tech
[31:30] company in in the country that's a huge
[31:33] incentive for Tech Founders to go and
[31:36] start their businesses there right so
[31:38] they will have to incentivize us to
[31:40] bring the fruits of our labor and our
[31:42] Capital into the country and just like
[31:44] that we have this beautiful Dynamic of I
[31:48] mean free market competition between
[31:50] nation states and just like in every
[31:52] free market there are two uh forces
[31:56] basically the price raised to the the
[31:58] bottom and the quality race to the top
[32:01] and I've been I've been doing it for
[32:06] last over 5 years now and I've been
[32:08] thinking about it and I realized that
[32:11] maybe I had a little too much hopei
[32:13] thinking that we would be moving in this
[32:14] direction
[32:16] faster and there are
[32:18] definitely um they they put they put
[32:22] blockers into our Wheels here and there
[32:24] they they do try to limit the way we can
[32:26] move with exit tax in the United States
[32:30] with prohibiting dual citizenship in
[32:31] Austria so all those tools are still in
[32:33] place but they at some point they will
[32:35] realize that they can't stop the free
[32:37] market so I have whole about it I'm
[32:41] seeing some Trends some of them towards
[32:45] this beautiful future some of them going
[32:47] in the other direction
[32:49] unfortunately um but yeah I just want to
[32:51] have this free market where people can
[32:53] pick and choose the
[32:55] country but but in general you see the
[32:58] competitive programs between those
[33:00] Nation stats increasing in the in the
[33:03] last years from the countries that have
[33:07] okay let's say we're talking about
[33:08] United States they are a really big big
[33:11] magnet of talent austri is actually too
[33:13] is too um
[33:16] they import a lot of talent right but
[33:19] they usually don't really like they
[33:22] still think they're the and they
[33:24] think it's going to be forever and
[33:26] people will never leave but they do
[33:28] leave and they start living and America
[33:30] has been seeing like exponential
[33:33] increase in the amount of people who
[33:34] actually renounce their US citizenship
[33:37] get rid of their American passport
[33:39] because of the taxes the the politics
[33:43] the culture but the countries that like
[33:46] El Salvador they had to make Bitcoin
[33:48] Illegal Tender they were at the bottom
[33:50] of the contian effect the money were
[33:52] printed in the US by the time they get
[33:54] to El Salvador like it's all devalued so
[33:58] they had this need to change things and
[34:02] those are going to be the countries who
[34:03] lead that um like Portugal not the not
[34:08] the wealthiest country in Europe is
[34:10] doing this golden visa thing where they
[34:12] really do try to bring foreign Capital
[34:15] it is not available for EU citizens but
[34:18] meaning that they are bringing Capital
[34:20] into EU from Mostly Canada us and Russia
[34:24] probably at this point um so the
[34:28] countries that are not at the top of the
[34:32] power Dynamic game they are the ones who
[34:35] going to be leading that they do have to
[34:37] be courageous because for example
[34:39] Caribbean islands who have really great
[34:41] citizenship by investment program they
[34:43] constantly getting hit by EU that EU
[34:46] doesn't like their programs because it
[34:48] does give new citizens a Visa free
[34:50] access to the EU so they want to have a
[34:53] say um but those countries need to be
[34:56] able to push back to let the EU know
[34:59] that they're not God and they shouldn't
[35:02] play one um and that's what Al salador
[35:06] showing showing the way to others
[35:08] they're being extremely courageous
[35:09] they're saying you to everybody and
[35:12] they're not afraid of that so that's
[35:14] beautiful to see yeah I think it's also
[35:17] really really beautiful it's also uh
[35:19] interesting because I think we are at a
[35:20] starting point of of all that Journey uh
[35:23] we needed the internet for that uh to be
[35:26] able to work from everywhere
[35:28] uh because like for me the the whole
[35:32] topic was arising once I got my income
[35:35] now from from online from podcasting
[35:37] from all those things then I was like oh
[35:39] like my my job is no longer in Austria
[35:41] like I can pack up my things and be
[35:44] anywhere I want uh so that was the first
[35:47] thing that even triggered me in asking
[35:49] those questions uh second thing is like
[35:51] of course money uh so like if you have
[35:54] those two things and they just like
[35:55] arise like the last like 10 20 years
[35:57] years uh basically uh and with remote
[36:00] work also that's that's also a big one
[36:02] uh so like I feel like we are right at
[36:05] the cusp of of something starting like
[36:07] we are like it's it's slowly moving
[36:09] there but those wheels at the nation
[36:11] state level they're not moving fast I
[36:14] feel like but you see that those those
[36:17] things that that are
[36:19] great hope you I have a lots of hopium
[36:22] for it yeah we need that hopium uh
[36:25] speaking of hopium uh I want to focus a
[36:27] little bit also on El Salvador it's a
[36:29] one one of the favorite countries right
[36:32] now for for Bitcoin it's also amazing to
[36:34] that we' talk about El Salvador right
[36:36] now because three four years ago we
[36:38] would probably not have talked about El
[36:40] Salvador at
[36:42] all but uh what are they doing and and
[36:45] why is it so attractive right now even
[36:48] outside of you want to move there
[36:49] because Bitcoin is cool yeah the
[36:53] advantage of El Salvador right now is
[36:55] they're a tiny country six million
[36:56] people
[36:58] um they basically operate as a startup
[37:00] you know when you compare to when you
[37:03] compare 10 people's startup to Microsoft
[37:05] the changes can be implemented much
[37:07] faster in the startup they can pivot in
[37:09] a day and have a completely new product
[37:12] rolled out in Microsoft it will take
[37:15] days and 17 project managers to move it
[37:18] to an actual developer right so same
[37:21] goes for El Salvador they realize um
[37:25] they they they realized that there were
[37:27] at the bottom then they had to just jump
[37:29] off the bottom and make changes really
[37:31] quick and that's what they started doing
[37:34] um so you know what they done in with
[37:36] the justice system and really went after
[37:40] gang members put a lot of people in jail
[37:44] which I don't know enough about to
[37:46] comment but seems like the country did
[37:49] become way safer they used to be the
[37:51] most dangerous country in the world now
[37:53] they're equal to Canada and they're like
[37:56] top one top two two safest countries in
[37:59] the North America which is like
[38:00] mindblowing to make that change in four
[38:03] years then they said Bitcoin is a legal
[38:07] tender and the country buys bit one
[38:09] Bitcoin every day how crazy is that
[38:12] they're stacking hard on top of it they
[38:14] said anybody can donate $1 million to El
[38:18] Salvador in Bitcoin and become a citizen
[38:21] of the country so they do have the
[38:23] citizenship by investment program that
[38:24] is more expensive than any other CBI in
[38:27] the world but that's just how they
[38:29] position themselves and there are people
[38:30] who are willing to donate $1 million in
[38:33] Bitcoin to have their citizenship to be
[38:36] part of that country and to support this
[38:38] country's um changes
[38:41] reforms now on top of that they are
[38:44] trying to educate local citizens
[38:46] citizens about Bitcoin they're investing
[38:48] a lot in advertising the um traveling in
[38:51] the country I've been seeing influencers
[38:54] on Instagram go to El Salvador and talk
[38:57] about how amazing the land is they call
[38:59] it an hour and a half country because
[39:01] basically you can get anywhere in an
[39:03] hour and a half so from volcano to the
[39:07] ocean you can surf uh you can eat
[39:10] papusas whatever you call it so um
[39:14] they're working on that and now they're
[39:16] installing an like an interesting tax
[39:19] regime for those who bring jobs who
[39:22] bring Capital who bring Innovations into
[39:25] the country for ago the President also
[39:28] announced that they're going to start
[39:30] the program for talent they're going to
[39:31] import talent and give citizenships to
[39:35] those who are like extremely
[39:37] extraordinary experts in their
[39:39] Industries um so that's an amazing
[39:42] program as well um so they just
[39:45] implement the changes so quickly that
[39:48] they attract more and more people um the
[39:51] changes again there's no the butterfly
[39:54] effect only has a couple stops until the
[39:57] country actually realizes what happens
[39:59] it's not that you make a tiny change and
[40:01] it takes 15 years for the country to
[40:03] realize all that no you can see the
[40:06] change in a week and two so um really
[40:10] amazing to see all that huge fan but for
[40:13] citizenships you have to donate not
[40:17] invest but donate a million dollars like
[40:19] that's a huge barrier for for for most
[40:23] people but yeah I guess they also have
[40:25] they have other programs so it's not
[40:26] that you order to move to Al salador you
[40:28] have to donate 1 million Again The
[40:31] Residency is really easy to obtain um
[40:34] you can have local employment you you
[40:35] can start local business you can just
[40:37] prove that you have income from abroad
[40:41] over $2,000 a month and you're good to
[40:43] stay so the residencies are very easy to
[40:46] obtain that's why a lot of bitcoiners
[40:48] just moving there getting their
[40:50] residency cards settling down in a
[40:53] country okay so like it would be very
[40:55] easy for me to to to move okay Co really
[41:00] cool perfect then uh this was uh really
[41:02] informative already um I asked that
[41:06] because uh um I asked you that before
[41:08] the podcast but I will ask you spe
[41:10] specifically now did I did I miss
[41:13] anything on that topic did I uh miss any
[41:16] question or any topic that that would be
[41:19] good to know for the audience no we
[41:21] actually did Cover a lot uh what I
[41:24] usually want to cover for those looking
[41:26] into Plan B passord again just want to
[41:28] mention it's a custom player process um
[41:31] if I didn't mention certain countries
[41:33] that you interested in I probably know
[41:35] their immigration policy can advise you
[41:37] what could work for you um we have a
[41:40] free consultancy call and that basically
[41:42] me brainstorming with bitcoiners and
[41:45] what would suit them best feel free to
[41:47] get it on our website let's let's think
[41:50] together really cool perfect um my end
[41:54] routine is always two questions the
[41:55] first question is always the same
[41:56] question for each guest uh and the
[41:58] question is what can we learn from you
[42:00] besides Bitcoin and plan B well I'm a
[42:02] mother I'm very proud of
[42:05] it um so anything about motherhood I
[42:08] really like to share um also I'm I'm
[42:12] doing a little like some call it radical
[42:15] motherhood or like alternative ways like
[42:17] I birth children at home I I start start
[42:22] them on solids meaning like introducing
[42:25] them to food in a very different way
[42:27] um so I I like to talk about it with
[42:30] bitcoiners because I feel we're like
[42:31] we're aligned like instead of giving
[42:34] them smashed fruit as their first food I
[42:37] give them steak because why not and
[42:39] that's been actually working out quite
[42:41] well for us um I had my baby right here
[42:44] where I'm currently sitting so at home I
[42:47] had a little pool here so anything about
[42:49] motherhood um I would love to talk about
[42:52] I love to see that so many bitcoiners
[42:55] are just parents and and love par like
[42:58] that that question um brings up a lot
[43:01] family uh and motherhood and Parenthood
[43:04] in general like that's that's uh amazing
[43:07] to see that that it's such a a great and
[43:09] huge topic like that it's it's really I
[43:12] think it's very healthy for the
[43:13] community to to see that aspect of of
[43:17] life so many times mention AB I highly
[43:20] recommend 10 out of 10 become a parent
[43:23] get babies check
[43:25] guys make baby use H that that's that's
[43:29] great yeah there are other entertainers
[43:31] where the previous guest is asking a
[43:32] question for the next guest without
[43:34] knowing who the next guest actually is
[43:36] uh and the question for you is what
[43:38] would Bitcoin have the biggest impact on
[43:40] outside of the financial system well
[43:43] that would be
[43:46] borders I really do believe that it does
[43:49] change the dynamic between the state and
[43:52] individuals separating the state of
[43:55] money takes a lot of control back from
[43:56] them
[43:57] so uh I don't like I mean border is an
[44:02] imaginary line and if you cross it you
[44:05] have to exchange money from one to
[44:07] another and then you have to have a
[44:09] certain piece of paper to prove that you
[44:11] belong on the side of an imaginary line
[44:14] so this whole concept is super weird um
[44:17] it needs to change and I think as a
[44:19] Global Currency that is decentralized
[44:22] and not controlled by any government we
[44:24] have a chance to make that happen so
[44:27] yeah geopolitics let's say that I I love
[44:31] that that you say it because like
[44:33] basically like um uh the business that
[44:36] you have is relying on those those rules
[44:38] but you're like I don't want those rules
[44:40] I to make it easy yeah I'm doing the
[44:43] best thing available right now but I
[44:45] wish it wasn't an issue so you wish you
[44:48] wouldn't had to do that yeah I I get
[44:50] that a lot it's it's really cool um
