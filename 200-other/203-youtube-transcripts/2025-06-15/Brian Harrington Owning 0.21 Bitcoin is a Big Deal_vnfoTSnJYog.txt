[00:00] why owning 0.21 Bitcoin is a big deal
[00:02] regular people can participate in
[00:04] Bitcoin right now owning .21 Bitcoin
[00:07] puts you in you are an influential
[00:10] bitcoiner you talk to a regular person
[00:12] on bitcoin Twitter a regular person on
[00:13] bitcoin YouTube all 100 to 99% of their
[00:16] long-term money is now in Bitcoin
[00:18] sitting here today you can direct
[00:19] deposit your paycheck to bitcoin and
[00:21] Bill Pay via an account routing number
[00:23] today Bitcoin personal finance
[00:24] strategies are going to be a combination
[00:26] of direct depositing to bitcoin holding
[00:28] either zero or some amount of fat taking
[00:31] some fat loans against your Bitcoin and
[00:33] then direct bill paying with Bitcoin
[00:35] once you adopt Bitcoin every bitcoiner
[00:38] is all of the sudden working for you if
[00:39] Michael saor acquires more Bitcoin
[00:41] because he has done good in his business
[00:43] that's good for every bitcoiner the tool
[00:45] set is already here for me as an
[00:47] individual to effectively hold zero Fiat
[00:49] and still live my life Bitcoin is
[00:51] happening right now in real time it's
[00:54] not a vague thing that's happening in
[00:56] the future
[01:01] I saw one really interesting thing
[01:03] because I did some videos on that but
[01:05] not enough videos I feel like uh and
[01:08] it's a very popular topic how many
[01:10] Bitcoin I should aim for and I saw like
[01:13] you made like two or three videos even
[01:15] on that topic um and I saw you pick the
[01:18] number
[01:20] 0.21 and there there are like in the
[01:23] early days it was like
[01:25] 6.1 because of the having rewards like
[01:28] why did you put uh what's the what's the
[01:31] vision for you for 0 point uh
[01:35] 0.21 yeah yeah so the why so why owning
[01:39] 0.21 Bitcoin is a big deal is the best
[01:42] YouTube video I've ever put out it's the
[01:44] first time I've ever been over 100,000
[01:46] on just just talking and the the reason
[01:49] why I put it out was because in the
[01:53] video I'm talking about how like point0
[01:55] 21 Bitcoin is you know it's a it's a
[01:59] it's a figure thousands of I live in the
[02:01] United States it's a what is it on the
[02:03] spot right now it's like
[02:04] $20,000 like right it's like it's like
[02:06] somewhere between1 $15,000 which is a
[02:10] good amount like that's a good amount of
[02:11] savings great chunk of money but not
[02:14] world changing not lifechanging and it
[02:17] also doesn't give you influence and in
[02:20] this video I kept coming back to the
[02:21] word influence to where owning .21
[02:26] Bitcoin puts you in you are an in
[02:29] influential bitcoiner but owning 10,000
[02:33] to $15,000 of Fiat like you are not an
[02:37] influential person unfortunately like
[02:39] not an influential person financially in
[02:42] the global economy or the United States
[02:44] economy or anything and so that's what I
[02:47] was talking about in this video is like
[02:49] it's really interesting to think about
[02:50] how much Bitcoin you should own from a
[02:52] financial perspective and from an
[02:53] investment perspective totally like
[02:55] totally um but it's also interesting to
[02:57] think about Bitcoin from this in fluence
[03:00] perspective and like 0. 21 because
[03:02] there's 21 million just thinking this
[03:04] like 0. 21 is just a great kind of
[03:07] initial handhold to really think about
[03:09] and so that's why that's why I picked
[03:11] that number and yeah apparently a lot of
[03:14] people connected with that yeah it's
[03:16] really interesting uh the perspective
[03:18] also with influence and not with wealth
[03:21] uh I like that never never heard that
[03:23] before uh just like I looked it up
[03:25] quickly this
[03:26] 13,300 like is a really uh cheap
[03:29] actually to get now to 0.1 0.21 Bitcoin
[03:33] and as you said like the the this is
[03:36] kind of the game theory topic like the
[03:39] the the small Nations could do that El
[03:41] Salvador is kind of doing that with one
[03:43] Bitcoin a day that will be I think a
[03:45] really big deal uh when when the Bitcoin
[03:48] adoptions further down the line and I
[03:51] mean us maybe do does it right now
[03:54] they're moving coins away since Trump
[03:56] spoke about it I don't know what what's
[03:58] going on there uh then Germany sold
[04:01] theirs um how do you see that is it the
[04:03] same thing for you also on on a nation
[04:05] state level how do you see um now
[04:09] adopting Bitcoin as an absolutely Game
[04:11] Theory
[04:13] Advantage yeah I I think it is fair on a
[04:15] country level to think about too um I'm
[04:17] trying to do the mental math right now
[04:19] of owning 0.21 puts you in I think it's
[04:22] the top 10000
[04:25] million yeah so the so I like your
[04:28] question about countries I kind
[04:31] of I something that's about me though is
[04:34] like I always am trying to just like
[04:35] think about the person like just the
[04:37] because I think Bitcoin so far like it
[04:39] goes so fast in like macroeconomics or
[04:42] like rich people or like governments or
[04:44] hedge funds and especially with the ETFs
[04:46] and stuff now like it's always just like
[04:48] kind of that or whatever there's there's
[04:50] always so there's a ton of content for
[04:52] people to like buy you know buy $10 a
[04:55] day at a time of like get started DCA
[04:58] and then there's all this stuff for like
[04:59] Edge funds and governments and like all
[05:01] this like stuff and like again back to
[05:03] kind of like why I like the 0.21 is like
[05:06] $113,000 21 Bitcoin is like if you're
[05:09] just a regular like quote unquote middle
[05:12] class just regular job like person 0.21
[05:16] Bitcoin kicks you into like a new
[05:19] influence level and now you're literally
[05:21] the floor is you'll be the top 100
[05:23] million people in the world there's
[05:25] seven eight billion people in the world
[05:26] like 100 million like you're now in the
[05:28] top and then you can get into the whole
[05:30] like lost Bitcoin or again all because
[05:32] the hedge funds are stacking so much
[05:33] more you're like chunking up and up but
[05:35] I just remember when I started watching
[05:37] when I started watching Bitcoin YouTube
[05:38] back in
[05:39] 2015 I like I love YouTube like I love
[05:42] what you do I love talking on YouTube I
[05:44] love sitting on the couch watching
[05:45] YouTube because that's where I learned
[05:46] about Bitcoin I watched tone base in
[05:48] 2015 and so for someone right now today
[05:51] that's just like you know got their
[05:53] wheels under them stacking a little bit
[05:55] like getting to 0. 21 is a big deal you
[05:58] don't have to think about what the hedge
[06:00] funds are doing or what the government's
[06:01] doing or what the whatever are doing
[06:02] because you yourself can like own that
[06:06] amount and have like an influential kind
[06:08] of like piece of the world now so that's
[06:11] a yeah I feel like also that's why um a
[06:16] DCA strategy is so powerful because like
[06:19] for when we talk about the average
[06:21] person not everyone has like now 15,000
[06:24] laying around and not doing anything and
[06:26] if you have on a bank account you should
[06:28] definitely think about investment
[06:30] because it's it's it's melting away um
[06:32] and that's like DCA is so so powerful
[06:35] and you also sent me in the preparation
[06:37] that you want to talk about what bit how
[06:39] the average person can live on a Bitcoin
[06:41] stand and I think that topic is really
[06:42] interesting uh how do you imagine like
[06:45] the the the average person now in New us
[06:47] can actually live on bitcoin uh
[06:50] especially if they have a high
[06:52] conviction and a High um percentage of
[06:54] their net worth in Bitcoin I mean right
[06:57] now I have like a little bit 100% I'm I
[07:00] want to come down to 95% again uh but
[07:04] how do you imagine that yeah so um one
[07:08] thing I love talking about is again kind
[07:10] of just regular people like I want to
[07:13] talk to just regular people that you've
[07:16] been orange pill right you're here
[07:18] you're learning about Bitcoin or have
[07:19] already learned about Bitcoin been in it
[07:21] for you know a few years or a lot of
[07:23] years that's fine like philosophically
[07:25] Bitcoin is better than Fiat we know that
[07:27] like we're lying on that Bitcoin is
[07:28] better than Fiat
[07:30] but you still have a direct deposit that
[07:33] comes over via an a deposit and you
[07:36] still have bill payments that have to go
[07:38] out to your mortgage payment your rent
[07:40] payment your credit card or car payment
[07:41] or whatever and these two things have
[07:44] been like balancing these two facts have
[07:47] been growing and growing for me like
[07:48] over these past like few years and so
[07:51] both on a both on like a personal level
[07:53] but also on a professional level and so
[07:54] yeah like I I work at f app now f app
[07:56] like fully fully solves this within the
[07:59] United States and so the concept of
[08:03] having Bitcoin as your main money but
[08:05] being backwards compatible to be able to
[08:08] pay your bills via an account and
[08:09] routing number receive a direct deposit
[08:11] via an account and routing number I
[08:12] think is a radical thing because it can
[08:15] because like Russell Kung tweeted pay me
[08:18] in Bitcoin back in 2019 and so ever to
[08:22] your part of like DCA like every like so
[08:25] Bitcoin became easier to buy everyone
[08:27] got on a DCA train which is good and
[08:29] awesome everyone very quickly racked up
[08:32] to where more than half of their like
[08:34] long-term savings is on bitcoin you talk
[08:36] to a regular person on bitcoin Twitter a
[08:38] regular person on bitcoin YouTube well
[08:40] 100 to 99% of their long-term money is
[08:43] now in Bitcoin and then even as early as
[08:45] 2019 people were starting to push the
[08:47] envelope of wanting to get paid in
[08:48] better Money Paid in better Money Paid
[08:50] in better money but up until now there's
[08:52] been a ceiling on how much you can
[08:53] direct deposit the Bitcoin because
[08:55] there's no way to bill pay from it so
[08:57] fold solves the bill pay cycle of that
[09:00] and that's what can click more and more
[09:02] people into receiving more and more of
[09:04] their direct deposit in Bitcoin more and
[09:05] more of their direct deposit in Bitcoin
[09:07] and so then again why that's positive is
[09:10] because it helps kind of like that
[09:12] regular person live on bitcoin because
[09:15] one of the problems with Bitcoin
[09:16] interviews and Bitcoin podcasts and
[09:18] Twitter is I think it's always like oh
[09:21] that influencer over there can live on
[09:23] bitcoin or you know that digital Nomad
[09:26] can live on bitcoin or yeah if you live
[09:28] in Salvador you can live on bitcoin but
[09:31] but I like I could never do that like I
[09:33] live in the suburbs I have a mortgage I
[09:36] have kids I have a regular job like
[09:39] there was that whole thing and I'm I'm
[09:41] now this I love that like I was
[09:43] scrolling your last couple guests and
[09:44] this recurring theme was like you can do
[09:46] it now like bitcoin's Happening Now
[09:49] Bitcoin is happening now and so I'm dude
[09:51] inject that into my veins like Bitcoin
[09:53] is happening
[09:55] now absolutely that's that's that's so
[09:57] true and um
[10:00] it's it's happening now but there's
[10:02] already this this um there are so many
[10:05] obstacles right now like you you
[10:07] mentioned with like you don't get paid
[10:08] in Bitcoin you get paid in feed uh if
[10:11] you convert something in Bitcoin and
[10:13] then we want to convert it back to to
[10:15] fear or you want to buy something with
[10:16] that you have to probably pay capital
[10:18] gains tax and that at least in most of
[10:20] the countries sometimes it's like lower
[10:22] or less if you hold it more than one
[10:24] year in Austria unfortunately not uh is
[10:29] there is there like um like I my
[10:31] strategy is always like keep uh the
[10:34] money that you don't need for your
[10:36] living expense and your Bitcoin wallet
[10:38] try to live like you don't ever touch it
[10:42] not in the next five 10 years and then
[10:44] live just on the money that you still
[10:46] have in your feat account in that way
[10:48] you never sell your Bitcoin you never
[10:50] have capital gain tax and you can just
[10:52] live on feat and you can have a very
[10:55] small margin and if you are far probably
[10:58] you need a bigger margin if you're
[10:59] father and you have a company you even
[11:01] need a bigger margin I'm 25 I'm
[11:04] self-employed I need no margin at all I
[11:07] have a way higher risk tolerance um so
[11:11] so do you have any any strategies here
[11:13] or like to totally I think you're
[11:16] exactly hitting on it I think so first
[11:18] off personal finance is very personal
[11:20] and so everyone's going to have a little
[11:21] bit different way of doing that and I
[11:24] like that there's tons of different ways
[11:26] to do it so I I think for a little bit
[11:29] sometimes talking about Bitcoin personal
[11:31] finance advice can steer very quickly
[11:33] into kind of
[11:35] like like social signaling and and then
[11:38] it just turns into this like random
[11:39] competition between me and you of like
[11:40] who can be the bigger Bitcoin or
[11:41] whatever and like what I what I don't
[11:43] like or what I what I like is that the
[11:45] concept of Bitcoin personal finance
[11:48] discussion and advice is actually is
[11:50] beginning to grow way past that to where
[11:52] it actually is more of a tactical
[11:54] conversation of just what is possible
[11:57] and what can you do so with that in mind
[11:59] the way that I tackled the whole capital
[12:01] gains issue is when previously pre in my
[12:07] previously that was a mental barrier for
[12:09] me also because I'm you know lean
[12:13] libertarian lean small government lean
[12:14] whatever like Freedom as like you know
[12:17] as a lot of people do and for them for
[12:20] me it was like oh paying gal gains taxes
[12:22] is like antithetical because that's like
[12:25] continuing you know a vision of the
[12:27] world that I don't want to foresee right
[12:28] and so this whole thing of of keep your
[12:32] Bitcoin until such a future where
[12:34] Bitcoin replaces the dollar and that's
[12:35] like eventually overturned right like
[12:37] that kind a very classic classic thing
[12:41] what I didn't what's new now and what
[12:44] helped me click past this was owning
[12:47] Bitcoin like having a capital game means
[12:51] you made a game like that's a good
[12:54] problem to have so connecting back to
[12:56] the influence part you know you you hold
[13:00] a person a person holding Bitcoin
[13:02] instead of Fiat and making a game
[13:06] literally has more stored labor more
[13:10] potential now underneath their future
[13:12] self than if they had held the Fiat
[13:15] money like that's good the am the more
[13:18] amount of bitcoiners that can be the
[13:21] most amount of wealthy as possible means
[13:24] that the future that you and I are both
[13:25] interested in will happen as fast as
[13:28] possible and so so for me that's the
[13:30] mental framework that changed combined
[13:33] with again the tools of fold and other
[13:36] places like tracking the capital gains
[13:38] even faster so that people so that it's
[13:40] not a headache it's not a headache you
[13:42] just receive a form the same way as you
[13:43] do with any other brokerage account and
[13:45] it you know you can manage your taxes
[13:46] for you and that's one place where
[13:49] bitcoiners in the and again I'm a very
[13:52] like I'm speaking very us Centric and
[13:53] that's like on on me but
[13:56] you like you have to kind of adopt the
[13:58] mental
[13:59] of how wealthy people in the US kind of
[14:01] already are and they're not afraid of
[14:05] that like they're not afraid of 3060 90
[14:07] minutes of like extra work a year or
[14:09] whatever so I my answer is like it's
[14:12] worth it and owning more Bitcoin for
[14:16] more days per year AKA living on bitcoin
[14:19] instead of holding Fiat like is worth it
[14:22] I guess and so I don't so I don't shy
[14:24] away from the fact that like there are
[14:26] capital gains taxes it does increase the
[14:28] work just a little a little bit I go
[14:30] immediately to the point of like I had
[14:31] that mental blocker also but it's worth
[14:34] it and then to your point of different
[14:36] people and different like life stages
[14:38] keeping a Fiat reserve of like different
[14:40] levels totally like absolutely and
[14:42] that's what's that's what's positive
[14:45] about everyone being able to do it like
[14:47] a little bit differently um but yeah
[14:50] that's that's the way I T tackled theuh
[14:52] taxes part is there um a room I mean
[14:56] it's a it's a hard topic because if
[14:59] Celsius and FTX and and the loan against
[15:01] Bitcoin kind of thing uh was kind of
[15:04] ruined by them uh but maybe we can get
[15:06] to a stage where there are more mature
[15:08] products coming out and and and more
[15:11] mature companies coming with that out um
[15:14] is loaning against the Bitcoin and just
[15:17] bringing the Bitcoin as collateral like
[15:20] you have I don't know if you have a big
[15:22] Bitcoin stack but you're not a big
[15:23] income guy so maybe you can get like
[15:25] five 10% of your Bitcoin out get some uh
[15:28] some of the live back because you know
[15:30] how
[15:31] much how how valuable that Bitcoin is
[15:34] and you can maybe afford the interest
[15:36] rates how do you see loaning against
[15:38] Bitcoin yeah so I definitely think it'll
[15:40] be part of it I definitely think it'll
[15:41] be part of it I don't think it's a fully
[15:44] Silver Bullet I think that there are
[15:46] going to I I think the personal the
[15:48] Bitcoin personal finance strategies that
[15:50] are being kind of written in real time
[15:52] through conversations like this are
[15:53] going to be a combination of direct
[15:55] depositing to bitcoin holding some like
[15:59] holding either zero or some amount of
[16:01] Fiat taking some Fiat loans against your
[16:04] Bitcoin and then direct bill paying with
[16:07] Bitcoin any and all of those are going
[16:09] to be a thing
[16:11] because the like and the reason why I
[16:14] don't see it as silver bullet is because
[16:16] I I'm I've never been able to fully
[16:18] connect with some of the videos that
[16:19] talk about how you just take the loan
[16:21] and then just as the exchange rate goes
[16:23] up you kind of just like roll it forward
[16:24] and Roll It Forward and Roll It Forward
[16:26] because I'm I'm like a decently like
[16:30] I've done a decent amount of like real
[16:31] estate transactions on like used the
[16:33] home equity line of credit and like use
[16:34] that kind of stuff before and it's like
[16:36] just from everything I know about the
[16:37] way that a home equity line of credit
[16:39] works I like I'm not able to kind of
[16:43] Envision this like rolling forward
[16:45] rolling forward rolling forward thing at
[16:46] least forever so that's why I don't so
[16:49] is it a powerful tool 100% absolutely do
[16:52] I see it as kind of like a
[16:54] daytoday bill pay tool not not super
[16:59] like I guess not for all of your
[17:02] expenses no I think it's also a big
[17:05] thing uh who who you are like it's so
[17:09] easy for someone like Michael sailor to
[17:11] get a loan for like I don't know 0.1% of
[17:14] interest rates uh but the the story is a
[17:17] different one if you have to pay 10% 5%
[17:19] or 15% or maybe even
[17:22] 20% on a on a credit so like there
[17:25] there's there's a lot of things to
[17:27] consider and a lot of variables um do do
[17:29] you see a point where or when do you see
[17:32] the point where we actually shift of
[17:34] Bitcoin being actual medium of exchange
[17:37] actually uh recognized by everyone uh
[17:40] there's no C gain taxs on like people
[17:43] like just accept it in the stores uh
[17:45] like a little bit life in El Salvador
[17:47] but maybe even more advanced than that
[17:49] in the whole world yep uh inside me life
[17:52] times like my answer is like inside our
[17:54] lifetime I think that's going to happen
[17:56] and and the reason and the reason why is
[17:58] because is today sitting here today you
[18:02] can direct deposit your paycheck to
[18:03] bitcoin and Bill Pay via an accountant
[18:06] routing number today so even so me as
[18:09] like a regular person in the United
[18:10] States the tool set is already here for
[18:12] me as an individual to effectively hold
[18:15] zero Fiat like in my account and still
[18:18] live my life relatively conveniently
[18:21] being backwards compatible and being
[18:23] able to withdraw it to my own wallet to
[18:25] because yeah withdraw it to my own
[18:27] wallet so now I'm effectively forwards
[18:29] compatible to paying people in Bitcoin
[18:31] so I'm like I'm lucky I have a like
[18:34] weekly meet up at a bar here in La it's
[18:36] called grey wolf brewing in L ire they
[18:39] take Bitcoin and so if if me as an
[18:42] individual can
[18:43] already like live on bitcoin through
[18:46] these accounts and then have one
[18:48] location that I know of like next to me
[18:50] that's already taking it I I mean inside
[18:52] our lifetime it'll way increase from
[18:54] there I think adoption rate is something
[18:57] that people uh underestimating they're
[19:00] like it's not that fast
[19:02] but I I compare it to the landline phone
[19:05] versus the cell phone like when was the
[19:08] point where we only had landline phones
[19:10] and maybe like one two people had like a
[19:12] smartphone or like a cell phone in the
[19:15] hands and then when was the point where
[19:17] it's super weird if you make a phone
[19:20] call with landline phone and we now so
[19:22] addicted to the cell phone like we we're
[19:24] coming from it's non-existing to we
[19:27] inventing boxes to lock our phones up
[19:30] because we too addicted to it so that
[19:32] was like 10 20 years it was like super
[19:35] quick and uh Bitcoin gives you so much
[19:39] advantages like 20 years is an
[19:41] interesting way like I always look at
[19:44] when will be a a kind of a developed
[19:46] Bitcoin standard like 20 30 years from
[19:48] now it's not impossible it depends on
[19:50] how how history treats us but I think it
[19:53] it could be very quick uh to to that
[19:56] whole uh adoption uh thing
[20:00] no absolutely I think I think very very
[20:02] quick absolutely and you also mentioned
[20:04] real estate did you do um some some real
[20:06] estate or like how do you see I think
[20:09] it's also a really interesting topic
[20:10] because I don't know how it's in America
[20:12] but in Austria real estate is kind of
[20:15] the personal life savings account for
[20:17] the middle class they they buy a house
[20:19] for 30y year loan and that's their the
[20:22] savings account uh which could be really
[20:24] interesting because when you see those
[20:26] price valuations what could uh be
[20:29] Bitcoin go through all those all the big
[20:31] part is like real estate has a big big
[20:34] valuation and that's because a lot of
[20:36] people saved their money in in real
[20:38] estate so you you did Real Estate and
[20:41] now switch to bitcoin or how how did
[20:43] this went yeah no great question so no I
[20:46] do it at the same time and what I mean
[20:47] by that is just like my wife and I own
[20:49] our house like and we own our previous
[20:51] house so we've we've moved twice now we
[20:52] kept the previous one as a rental um in
[20:55] the United States re owning your home
[20:58] being a real estate like owning a
[21:01] primary residence and investing in real
[21:03] estate is the number one path to being a
[21:04] millionaire in the United States uh like
[21:07] the most amount of people become a
[21:09] millionaire through that method and
[21:11] there's a lot of reasons for that but I
[21:13] do think there's a lot of similarities
[21:15] and things that bitcoiners can learn
[21:18] from that concept and so couple base
[21:20] things that I believe like the reason
[21:23] why like interior square footage like
[21:25] interior square foot holding interior
[21:27] square footage is better than holding
[21:29] dollars like also holding Bitcoin is
[21:32] better than holding dollars because like
[21:34] structurally Fiat doesn't work and
[21:36] that's what bitcoiners are so great at
[21:38] hammering we're so great at hammering
[21:39] and that's where so structurally Fiat
[21:42] dollars do not work the other thing
[21:44] that's interesting about mortgages is
[21:46] mortgages are effectively you know
[21:47] government back like the ability to get
[21:50] 90% leverage a 90% loan on a finite
[21:54] asset and the finite asset is like the
[21:57] concrete the glass
[21:59] the wood like the human labor that goes
[22:02] into building it like that is a very
[22:04] real tangible thing and so the fact that
[22:06] you're able to get a 90% loan of printed
[22:10] Fiat for that thing I don't foresee that
[22:14] kind of reversing like I a base case for
[22:17] me is I kind of see everything melting
[22:20] up together whether it's the stock
[22:21] market the real estate market and
[22:23] Bitcoin kind of like all melting up
[22:25] together I think everything would have
[22:26] to be like very very big before you kind
[22:30] of get the predicted kind of like
[22:33] Bitcoin eating other things kind of
[22:35] stuff you know like that like that the
[22:37] whole like Bitcoin removing the monetary
[22:39] premium from uh home ownership is pretty
[22:44] hard for me to see like that to me
[22:46] that's honestly past the first question
[22:49] you asked me of the like will Bitcoin
[22:51] you know transition into a dominant
[22:53] medium of exchange inside like our
[22:55] lifetime I honestly believe that Bitcoin
[22:58] transition into a dominant medium
[22:59] exchange would almost have to be a
[23:01] precursor before Bitcoin begins to like
[23:04] demonetize real estate if you watch or
[23:06] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[23:08] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[23:11] and now the most important step is to
[23:14] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[23:17] hardware wallet my personal
[23:18] recommendation for Hardware wallet is

[24:14] in Bitcoin self- custody and how to be a
[24:17] secure sovereign individual in general
[24:20] and last but not least I have something
[24:22] completely new for you guys I partnered
[24:26] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[24:29] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[24:32] saw created by anyone look at that
[24:35] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[24:37] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[24:40] the perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[24:44] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[24:46] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[24:50] make sure to check out the link in the
[24:51] description for this amazing coin
[24:54] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[24:56] amazing I love them so much it was
[24:58] really hard for me to pick the one that
[25:00] I want to have because there are a lot
[25:02] of great options I went with the new
[25:05] transparency Edition they're all limited
[25:08] so grab yours those will not be
[25:11] available for a long time but there will
[25:13] come new models and new amazing designs
[25:16] along the way oh that's interesting
[25:18] because uh I think most always see like
[25:20] there's first like the store of value
[25:22] has to completely proceed and then we
[25:24] move past to to medium exchange why do
[25:26] you think that that Medium Exchange
[25:28] change comes comes first I mean to Value
[25:30] already here but why do you think so I
[25:33] think because it I I give him personal
[25:36] examples so
[25:38] I sh when a new person gets Bitcoin or
[25:41] when a new person hears about Bitcoin
[25:42] one of the first things they say is well
[25:44] how do I buy groceries with how do I
[25:45] spend it how do I spend it right and I
[25:48] don't think that's actually them trying
[25:51] to kind of like needle the bitcoiner or
[25:53] like throw them off or saying that they
[25:54] don't believe or whatever I think that's
[25:56] literally just what you're telling me
[25:58] that it's better money the primary use
[26:00] case I have for money is to get things
[26:03] for my house I'll do that money but then
[26:06] tell me how it works it's almost like a
[26:08] trust mechanism like and I'm saying
[26:11] trust in like a neutral way you're just
[26:12] like you mentally have to close the loop
[26:15] of this works for my main use case of
[26:19] getting something into my house and so
[26:22] right now the like the Bitcoin bucket
[26:24] and the Fiat bucket are competing with
[26:26] each other effectively for people's
[26:28] direct deposit like effectively your
[26:30] labor because the the work that people
[26:33] do that they're earning money for is
[26:35] like the scarce thing right and then
[26:37] everyone chooses am I direct depositing
[26:39] to bitcoin or am I direct depositing to
[26:41] like to USD am I storing my labor in
[26:43] Bitcoin or am I storing my labor you
[26:45] know in USD and closing the loop of
[26:48] being able to do day-to-day things on
[26:51] bitcoin UPS the amount of people that
[26:54] can up the amount of Labor that they're
[26:57] storing in Bitcoin which is why I don't
[26:59] see them as like separate things like I
[27:01] don't think there's actually this like
[27:02] order of events of like oh store value
[27:05] like oh and then Medi exchange and I
[27:08] would say again even if even if I kind
[27:12] of like concede that that has to happen
[27:14] in a certain order it's not happening in
[27:16] a certain order for every single human
[27:18] on the planet at the exact same time so
[27:20] there's people that are going to
[27:21] speedrun through and speedrun through
[27:23] through all the things and I think now
[27:26] like if someone I think people are going
[27:29] to be able to download Bitcoin apps that
[27:30] take them to both immediately and
[27:33] they're not and they're not going to go
[27:35] through this like period of the like
[27:37] chicken or the egg thing that a lot of
[27:39] us went through over the past you know
[27:40] six seven years do you also think that
[27:43] we we should spend our Bitcoin toing in
[27:46] increase uh adoption or is does it not
[27:50] matter like yeah so like what the short
[27:55] answer is yes like the short I would the
[27:57] short answer is like I'll answer yes the
[27:58] reason why I'm like hesitating a little
[28:00] bit is because the like should you do it
[28:02] to help it's like look
[28:07] people
[28:08] I'm a lot of times when people talk
[28:11] about the circular economy they tell
[28:13] they say that like oh the bitcoiners
[28:16] should do something that's like
[28:17] economically irrational in order to like
[28:20] get the adoption or whatever I don't I
[28:22] don't think that it's irrational to like
[28:25] quote unquote spend your Bitcoin like I
[28:27] think it's just simply using a different
[28:30] thing like you you could pay with two
[28:32] different credit cards out of your
[28:34] wallet like if you're for this gry
[28:36] example if you're already going to buy
[28:39] three beers for
[28:41] $24 just and even if you hadn't done
[28:43] anything then simply buy $30 of Bitcoin
[28:47] before going in there and then use that
[28:49] as your method like I guess I don't know
[28:51] I think I'm hesitant to say that
[28:56] people like
[28:58] should like should do it for the
[29:00] adoption because I think it's
[29:02] economically like rational for the
[29:04] person in general even and like the for
[29:08] the adoption part I guess is like a a
[29:10] double benefit it's like gravy I guess
[29:13] wait that's an interesting example of
[29:14] like buying Bitcoin directly before you
[29:18] um buy things with Bitcoin because there
[29:22] is probably zero to no C gains because
[29:26] the C gains will be very less if if
[29:28] there is a couple gains like that's a
[29:30] benefit from the you so like if in that
[29:33] I don't know 30 minutes that you drank
[29:36] the beer from like getting the Bitcoin
[29:38] to dring and the Bitcoin price shoots up
[29:40] 10% you pay capital gain STX but that's
[29:43] a that's a positive thing uh so that's
[29:46] interesting no exactly and that's where
[29:48] that's where I just I think we over
[29:50] complicated it for a few years there
[29:52] like I think OG bitcoiners were great at
[29:55] talking about Bitcoin they were not
[29:57] great at talking about personal finance
[29:59] like they and and that's what I'm trying
[30:02] to just like reset that whole thing and
[30:04] me and others like tons of other that's
[30:06] what I that's my favorite thing about
[30:08] Bitcoin right now whether it's YouTube
[30:09] or Twitter or whatever is this whole
[30:13] chicker the egg thing almost the ice is
[30:15] Tha on all of that like it just is what
[30:17] it is it is what it is and you don't
[30:19] have to overthink it as much anymore
[30:21] which I think is leading to faster and
[30:23] faster onboarding of again back to these
[30:26] like quote unquote regular people that
[30:28] super care about and so an example of
[30:29] that is this so This Bar that that takes
[30:32] Bitcoin when when I was doing this four
[30:35] five years ago at a different bar that
[30:37] took Bitcoin our the bartender we could
[30:39] tip her in Bitcoin for a new person to
[30:42] participate they would have to uh we
[30:44] would have to tell them the app they
[30:45] would have to download the app they
[30:47] would have to pass all the stuff and
[30:48] they would have to come back the next
[30:49] week and then that's when they could
[30:50] participate
[30:52] now uh the bar takes Bitcoin the ner the
[30:57] like hardcore people from internet come
[30:58] and they participate and it already
[31:00] Works what we've also seen is that a few
[31:03] I'll call them like Normie adjacents
[31:05] like people that are just already at the
[31:06] bar they didn't come for the Meetup they
[31:08] already had a coinbase account like on
[31:09] their phone and they were also able to
[31:11] pay with lightning from coinbase and so
[31:14] the fact that the bar like that the fact
[31:17] that it just worked means that the
[31:19] adoption is getting faster and faster
[31:20] and faster and so now that person the
[31:23] very first day that they were like wow
[31:25] you guys are here for Bitcoin that's
[31:26] awesome like d we didn't hit them with
[31:28] the speech about like the savings
[31:31] technology versus the spending
[31:32] technology or whatever we just hit them
[31:34] with the like yes we're here for Bitcoin
[31:36] bitcoin's here in this town and it's
[31:38] awesome and then boom they were able to
[31:40] participate with the like mainstream app
[31:43] that they already had on their phone
[31:44] that's that's just proving that it's
[31:47] like moving faster and faster are we now
[31:49] at that like really critical S curve
[31:52] adoption uh point where we kind of
[31:54] filled all the buckets like uh we we
[31:57] have all we have already bars that are
[31:59] doing it we have ETFs we have Nation
[32:02] India we have the individuals we have
[32:04] the publicly traded companies we have we
[32:05] have kind of all people already in there
[32:07] and now we just waiting to to get that
[32:10] esur like do you think that we are not
[32:11] at that this like I think 10% adoption
[32:13] rate yeah so I don't know what the
[32:15] official number is I don't know where
[32:16] the official place on esur is but like
[32:18] is Bitcoin mainstream absolutely like
[32:20] yeah I believe that bitcoin's mainstream
[32:22] I believe that everyone already has had
[32:25] their first second third touches with it
[32:27] already has some sort of mental opinion
[32:29] about it
[32:30] and the like you have the hardcore
[32:35] people that have like felt an upside
[32:36] from it it's dramatically improved their
[32:38] life and then you have various people
[32:39] all the way down to where even the
[32:41] people like we onboarded a guy that was
[32:45] just he his thing was just like you know
[32:47] honestly like I'm I'm just too busy like
[32:50] hadn't ever like actually tried it yet
[32:52] like actually hadn't been burned by any
[32:54] of the bad apps or any of the whatever
[32:55] it just had like ridden it out the whole
[32:57] time hadn't participated yet and I was
[32:59] just like dude honestly like you're
[33:00] already at a great time frame because
[33:03] it's all like you skipped a lot of the
[33:05] headaches like you skipped a lot of the
[33:06] headaches and so it just is now and so
[33:09] him participating he's not going to be
[33:11] faced with the whole like there there is
[33:15] just yeah it's just mainstream like you
[33:16] said all that stuff where it's already
[33:18] happening and now it's just another app
[33:19] on his phone that he's able to
[33:20] participate with absolutely really cool
[33:23] the last question that I have on
[33:24] Personal Finance is uh also credit
[33:27] related the the other way around um when
[33:30] we now think of like oh I want to reach
[33:32] 0.21 Bitcoin um we are now coming slowly
[33:36] to a bull run I'm fearful that the
[33:38] Bitcoin price runs my purchasing power
[33:40] away and I'm not able to get to that
[33:42] point um does it make sense for you to
[33:46] to take a credit out to in order to buy
[33:49] Bitcoin not like against the Bitcoin but
[33:51] to buy Bitcoin uh because you brought
[33:53] out also the real estate example of like
[33:55] the real estate is so magical because
[33:58] you can actually do the leverage game
[34:01] and you actually leverage from that a
[34:02] lot yeah um so personally telling me to
[34:07] not give my main answer on this so I'm
[34:08] gonna give my main answer on this like I
[34:10] think if
[34:12] I again this is very us answer I love 0%
[34:15] balance credit card like offers so i'
[34:20] I've personally used 0% balance like
[34:22] transfers for multiple things in my life
[34:24] over like multiple years and so look
[34:26] like if you're a person who who has a
[34:28] great credit score has demonstrated that
[34:30] you understand how to use credit like in
[34:32] your life absolutely I think like
[34:34] learning how to use from a personal
[34:36] finance perspective learning how to use
[34:39] credit and easy to get credit and good
[34:43] priced Credit in order to increase the
[34:46] amount of assets you own is like a
[34:47] really valuable skill to skill to like
[34:50] understand
[34:51] definitely it's a I think even safine
[34:55] mentioned it in his book in field
[34:57] standard was kind of the conclusion to
[34:59] that because like Fiat is eroding so
[35:02] quickly that you can gain a lot from the
[35:04] fall of Fiat it's kind of like a short
[35:06] against fear and a long in in Bitcoin
[35:10] which can be very beneficial but yeah as
[35:12] as you said before like it's a it's it
[35:14] depends on on your personal uh situation
[35:17] and your Finance like it's it's not for
[35:19] everyone um you mentioned something
[35:21] before uh that you're like oh we we know
[35:23] that Bitcoin is superior philosophical
[35:26] um do you think that is on like why are
[35:29] we in uh why are we so Superior yeah
[35:36] because be like because humans aren't
[35:39] involved in the like Supply decision
[35:41] because the the
[35:44] the Fiat Supply is decided by a group of
[35:49] insiders all the time like there's no
[35:52] that's physically physically how it
[35:54] works and it's like the decision and all
[35:57] of the reasons around it and even the
[36:00] way that the decision is released is
[36:02] physically gate cuted and with Bitcoin
[36:05] the monetary Supply is not that's the
[36:07] like number one answer I get like that's
[36:09] the when people are like why is Bitcoin
[36:10] better than Fiat because the supply is
[36:13] not tied to regular human politics
[36:17] regular human insider versus Outsider
[36:21] games that's why it's like that's why
[36:22] it's philosophically better yeah even
[36:24] even it's it's not even tied to to human
[36:27] incentives what which I find extremely
[36:31] amazing because like if real estate
[36:33] prices are going up the roof extremely
[36:36] uh then people will be very very um
[36:39] creative with uh building new real
[36:41] estate like higher houses smaller units
[36:44] and all those things like uh making
[36:47] property that would only be for farming
[36:49] maybe
[36:50] into buying and uh building and property
[36:53] and stuff like that there's a lot of
[36:54] there's a lot of land and a lot of space
[36:56] in on the Earth left to to explore and
[36:59] maybe also like then space travel and
[37:01] stuff like that and even with gold like
[37:02] people will be turning in their gold
[37:05] that they have their jewelies and and
[37:07] digging up gold and the companies have
[37:09] more money to do that which is a really
[37:11] powerful uh thing that the Bitcoin like
[37:14] can shoot up tomorrow at to like1
[37:16] million US Dollars and the supply
[37:19] doesn't move right Supply is what the
[37:22] supply is that's that's an incredible
[37:24] underestimated thing I think at least no
[37:28] agree it still blows on mind like it's
[37:30] still agree still blows on mind
[37:33] absolutely and you um I think you were
[37:36] also involved in in in Bitcoin startups
[37:39] is that right uh what was the last word
[37:42] you were involved in in Bitcoin startups
[37:45] right yeah yeah yeah yeah so I've yeah
[37:47] I've worked for Bitcoin startups since
[37:49] uh 2019 um a few different different
[37:51] ones of them and so yeah like
[37:53] being and mainly what I'm focused on now
[37:56] today is like I really want to kind of
[37:59] one of the reasons why I'm thankful to
[38:00] be it pull is because I think a lot of
[38:01] bitcoiners need to understand the guts
[38:03] of like fintech even more and even like
[38:05] taking Bitcoin out of it for a second
[38:07] the hurdles that kind of like fintex
[38:09] have to go through in order to kind of
[38:13] quote unquote like beat beat the big
[38:14] Banks is like a really really like
[38:17] interesting kind of like startup thing
[38:19] to go through and I don't think always
[38:21] users know all of that and so that's my
[38:24] uh I don't know that's just my main
[38:26] takeaway right now off top of like yeah
[38:28] being involved on the the working for
[38:30] Bitcoin companies side of it for uh for
[38:32] so many years what did you learn uh
[38:35] about Bitcoin from working in a in a
[38:37] Bitcoin Fint uh startup world yeah I
[38:41] think that main thing I learned about
[38:43] Bitcoin from this I think that maybe
[38:45] that that everyone doesn't see Bitcoin
[38:48] the same way like I think you you
[38:50] intuitively know this you intuitively
[38:52] know this but when you're trying to make
[38:55] a Bitcoin app for the main stream or
[38:58] when you're really trying to think
[39:00] about how other various groups of people
[39:05] see see Bitcoin you have to learn how to
[39:09] kind of talk about it in multiple
[39:11] multiple different ways so that's kind
[39:13] of my that's yeah that's probably my
[39:15] main takeway really interesting um as
[39:18] you're also from from fintech and uh um
[39:21] really St on all all all those things
[39:23] how do you think um Bitcoin could or
[39:26] will reshape the definition of wealth
[39:29] and and being rich and being
[39:31] wealthy
[39:32] yeah I think that well first off I think
[39:35] bitcoiners can learn a lot from like
[39:37] kind of looking at the way that current
[39:40] wealthy like cohorts kind
[39:42] of already are or like already perform
[39:46] how do I think Bitcoin is going to
[39:48] reshape that I
[39:50] think this is maybe a very like cheesy
[39:53] answer but but I think it a lot of
[39:55] people talk about the middle class talk
[39:57] about the wealth of the middle class or
[39:58] the talk talk about you know the like
[40:00] lower upper class or whatever and just
[40:02] kind of how like wealth inequality is
[40:04] just like spreading and spreading and
[40:06] spreading right like I think Bitcoin
[40:09] actually functionally solves the problem
[40:12] for the middle it actually functionally
[40:15] solves the problem for the middle
[40:17] because like you know the term like a
[40:20] rising tide lifts all boats like Bitcoin
[40:24] actually is that like because of all of
[40:26] the things things that we know about it
[40:28] the fix Supply like um uncorrupt ability
[40:30] and all those things a person can now
[40:34] just work a regular job and not have to
[40:38] be constantly a top 1% investor or top
[40:41] 10% investor in order to like outperform
[40:45] the kind of like Fiat slippage that's
[40:47] happening all the time they can just do
[40:49] their thing and the money not sucking
[40:54] will
[40:55] like create floor for them and so I
[40:59] think that's the number one thing that's
[41:00] going to kind of change that's what's
[41:02] going to change in the middle and then
[41:03] what's going to change at the top is
[41:06] what's going to change at the top is
[41:07] it's just going to turn out who's there
[41:09] it's going to turn out who's there
[41:10] because Bitcoin is so Superior to other
[41:12] forms of investment and other for like
[41:16] unfortunately other forms of being
[41:20] wealthy like are tied to kind of these
[41:23] like Insider Outsider games a lot of
[41:26] times like a very High degree of kind of
[41:29] like who's in the top top top of the top
[41:32] comes with these Insider Outsider games
[41:34] and so people that like enter that world
[41:38] through Bitcoin are now like a literally
[41:42] a
[41:43] different kind of like demographic than
[41:45] who's there right now and so that's how
[41:47] I see kind of the top top changing and I
[41:49] see this like actual middle middle class
[41:53] like having
[41:54] influence and uh do you think that the
[41:57] the poor the lower classes um will maybe
[42:02] even vanish because they will uprise to
[42:05] the middle class or will there always be
[42:08] that really bottom pool
[42:10] class yeah yeah um I hesitate I mean I
[42:15] hesitate to say that it'll be fully
[42:19] gone I do but obviously like for for me
[42:23] to believe that it helps the middle like
[42:25] it obviously can help all tier like it
[42:27] can definitely help all
[42:29] tiers and I mean I for sure think
[42:31] Bitcoin I don't know why this is where
[42:33] my brain's going but like you know a lot
[42:35] of people buy lottery tickets like a lot
[42:37] of people just like spend dollar $5 $10
[42:39] at a time on lottery tickets like
[42:42] Bitcoin is that is like it's like you
[42:45] could be like you're buying lottery
[42:47] tickets in slow motion like you're
[42:48] actually building equity in something so
[42:50] it's the same for it's the same kind of
[42:53] like emotional payoff like as a lottery
[42:57] but you're building equity in it and
[42:59] you're actually like stacking your like
[43:01] chances over time to like kind of grow
[43:05] and get a hold of something I I love the
[43:08] lottery ticket comparison because I know
[43:11] even in my life I know people that are
[43:13] regularly buying Lottery dicks and I'm
[43:15] like yeah if you just put that money in
[43:17] the Bitcoin yeah the last years that you
[43:20] already did you would be already way
[43:24] wealthier and did not have to lose money
[43:27] and no it's not that much money and it's
[43:29] it's not making a big difference well
[43:31] that's and that's a part of the problem
[43:33] like people people that don't own asset
[43:35] like the the split is people that own
[43:37] assets versus people that don't own
[43:38] assets because Fiat is functionally
[43:40] broken like and that's the whole again
[43:42] we just pound the drum and pound the
[43:43] drum but like Fiat is functionally
[43:45] broken holding it does not increase in
[43:49] value holding it does not increase in
[43:51] purchasing power and so you like it is
[43:55] like it's not doing it anything for you
[43:58] like so the fact that you can own buy
[44:01] acquire a dollar of Bitcoin at a time
[44:04] and get a hold of something a little
[44:06] more tangible there's no there's nothing
[44:10] else available for a dollar at a time
[44:13] that is tangibly on any sort of growth
[44:17] like trajectory even like even take all
[44:20] like even take all of the kind of like
[44:23] hard money like macroeconomic stuff out
[44:25] of it for a second just like like
[44:27] there's there's I don't know what else
[44:29] can you acquire for a dollar that is on
[44:32] any sort of network effect growth
[44:35] projecting in the world there's nothing
[44:38] there's nothing yeah that's an amazing
[44:41] way to look at it it it it shifts a
[44:44] perspective away where we like go
[44:46] Lottery yeah you might win something but
[44:49] your chances are so so so so so slim
[44:52] that you almost guaranteed to lose and
[44:55] in Bitcoin you almost guaranteed to win
[44:59] like it's like why do you choose the
[45:01] lottery ticket it's like a losing losing
[45:04] thing to do it's it's really cool the
[45:06] thing about that and you're not playing
[45:07] alone like you're not playing alone it's
[45:09] not you versus the other people in the
[45:11] pool that's the that's the other problem
[45:13] with lotteries is it's you versus the
[45:14] other people in the pool there's can
[45:16] only be one winner like Bitcoin there
[45:19] isn't only one winner like it's
[45:21] literally it's literally people choosing
[45:24] that Bitcoin is better than Fiat money
[45:27] and you're all like that's what that's
[45:29] what I love about it is that there's
[45:30] there's no single there's also again no
[45:32] single way to kind of like improve your
[45:35] life and also be like contributing
[45:38] towards a broader societal like
[45:41] Improvement than
[45:43] Bitcoin that's a big thing um once you
[45:46] adopt Bitcoin everyone is working for
[45:49] you every bitcoiner is all of the sun
[45:51] working for you if if marichel sa
[45:53] acquires more Bitcoin because he has
[45:54] done good in his business that's good
[45:57] for every bitcoiner yeah if you do
[45:59] something that that brings value to your
[46:01] life and you st save that value in
[46:04] Bitcoin this benefit uh every every
[46:07] Bitcoin benefits from that that's a big
[46:09] thing uh that I think a lot of people
[46:11] don't really think about what that can
[46:14] also do to society when all of the
[46:17] sudden everyone uses that Bitcoin
[46:19] because now we also have this nation
[46:21] thing going on like Euro Zone bricks
[46:23] there's China there is the US and yeah
[46:26] of course
[46:27] um if if the US people work together the
[46:30] US people benefit from having companies
[46:32] like Google there having companies like
[46:34] Amazon there but what if the whole world
[46:38] doesn't have fear currencies like 50
[46:40] different fear currencies but have one
[46:42] Bitcoin standard and someone in Nigeria
[46:47] benefits a lot if there's a really nice
[46:49] company in in Sweden because it benefits
[46:52] whole society I think that's a really
[46:55] interesting topic what do you think
[46:57] could that do to the society at large
[46:59] yeah I I mean I think it yeah it like it
[47:02] changes the game it changes the game
[47:04] again instead of instead of the success
[47:08] you know floating to like the small
[47:11] group of people that choose the rules of
[47:14] each of the like each of those Fiat
[47:16] currencies is a network each of those
[47:17] Fiat currencies is a network and again
[47:19] you're right they are they're trying
[47:21] they're competing against each other
[47:22] they're attracting companies attracting
[47:24] individuals and if you choose to join
[47:27] that Network you're benefiting the
[47:29] Insiders in that network but if there
[47:32] was a global open source Network where
[47:35] everyone was contributing together and
[47:37] there was no leakage like there's
[47:39] there's no leakage where the you know
[47:42] cut of it is like where your
[47:45] productivity is getting like shaved off
[47:47] and shaved off just that in of itself
[47:50] you're GNA feel wealthier absolutely um
[47:54] we already coming to closer to the end
[47:56] routine uh I have one question that ask
[47:58] all my my podcast guests uh and I'm
[48:00] really curious about what you're saying
[48:02] about that um what can we learn from you
[48:06] besides all the things that you already
[48:08] talked about yeah yeah the the main
[48:12] thing that I enjoy talking about the
[48:14] most
[48:15] is regular people like the the number
[48:18] one thing I like the most is regular
[48:20] people can participate in Bitcoin right
[48:23] now Bitcoin is happening right now in
[48:26] real time
[48:27] it's not a vague thing that's happening
[48:30] in the future it's physically happening
[48:33] right now and you're able to adopt it to
[48:35] whatever degree you want you know kind
[48:38] of right now and then also I think kind
[48:41] of like thinking about yourself as a
[48:44] person of influence like if you if
[48:47] you've already listened to all the
[48:49] Bitcoin podcasts understand all of the
[48:51] stuff like heard it all before I think
[48:55] like really start to think
[48:57] about you kind of like your place in it
[49:01] sounds so cheesy to say like changing
[49:03] the world but like your place in being
[49:07] an influential person in the world that
[49:10] doesn't have to look like traditional
[49:11] politics it doesn't have to look like
[49:13] you know it doesn't it can be anything
[49:14] that can literally mean anything that
[49:16] can that can honestly just mean
[49:17] networking within your town like I think
[49:20] you're like people knowing your name
[49:23] knowing that you've kind of like made
[49:27] positive financial decisions I I I just
[49:29] think that the that's gon to make the
[49:33] Bitcoin kind of like standard I guess
[49:34] like happen even faster because you as a
[49:37] person are really
[49:39] influential that's an interesting thing
[49:41] because uh I talked a lot about on a
[49:44] space with with a group how to Orange
[49:47] build people and my standpoint was when
[49:51] you as a person are as positive and
[49:54] happy and uh um like trained and you you
[49:58] you do good in life and you just like
[50:01] are giving and your Society is like oh
[50:03] like he's a nice one like he's giving to
[50:06] the society that's the number one thing
[50:09] how you can orange PE people if you
[50:11] successful and happy and giving people
[50:14] will notice that and if you tell them
[50:16] yeah I'm living on a Bitcoin standard of
[50:18] course like what else should you do that
[50:20] alone is orange peing people because
[50:22] then uh someone that has Bitcoin is a
[50:26] ass with this positive things and not
[50:29] someone that has his life not together
[50:30] that's why I also think it's very
[50:32] powerful that we in Bitcoin talk so much
[50:34] about diets so talk so much about
[50:37] working out talking so much about having
[50:39] a positive uh and good life for each
[50:42] other because that's actually also um
[50:45] putting the Bitcoin adoption forward
[50:48] because people see like oh Bitcoin are
[50:50] like oh he is fit he is he's doing good
[50:53] like he's a disciplined person he's a
[50:54] giving person so that's an that's an
[50:57] very interesting point that you also
[50:59] raised in there really cool um and for
[51:02] the endro tetin we have uh always where
[51:05] the previous guest is asking a question
[51:07] for the next guest uh without knowing
[51:09] who the next guest actually is uh really
[51:12] cool tin um the previous guest asked
[51:15] when Bitcoin hits one million what would
[51:18] you
[51:19] buy I love that uh okay I have to I'm
[51:22] having to think about what my question
[51:23] is GNA be for the next person while
[51:25] while I'm thinking about this
[51:27] the one Bitcoin exchange rate is a
[51:30] million dollars USD Fiat versus one
[51:33] Bitcoin probably probably going back to
[51:36] my real estate answer like another like
[51:38] another house like another pretty nice
[51:41] house is definitely what I'm going be
[51:43] doing um at that level uh another thing
[51:45] would be Pro probably like a probably a
[51:49] bar or restaurant too like I'm
[51:51] definitely a little bit of a Roman like
[51:53] romantic for that like I just love
[51:55] meetups like I like Bitcoin meet I like
[51:57] the idea of small businesses and so
[52:00] definitely either like real estate or a
[52:02] small
[52:03] business could could be um both like a
[52:06] small small uh um bar where you buy the
[52:10] real estate and then you have the small
[52:13] business inside like that could be
[52:15] combined 100% no 100% because then I
[52:18] would just blast the address everywhere
[52:19] and we're just like growing equity in
[52:21] that space 100% yeah yeah true that
[52:24] would be a good good fit um perfect then
[52:27] yeah thank you so much uh Brian for
