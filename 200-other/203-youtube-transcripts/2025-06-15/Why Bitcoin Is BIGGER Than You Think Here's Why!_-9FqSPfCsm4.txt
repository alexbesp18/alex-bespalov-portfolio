[00:00] but there is a universal language which
[00:01] is English and there is an emerging
[00:04] universal language for Value which is
[00:06] Bitcoin try to take a billion dollars
[00:09] worth of value from Tokyo to Hong Kong
[00:13] from Hong Kong to London from London to
[00:17] Brazil without anybody even noticing
[00:20] look we're not at $10,000 a coin anymore
[00:23] we're much much higher now there could
[00:25] be an argument that you can make that
[00:28] this is already Maybe in 2015 of the
[00:31] internet right you could make that
[00:33] argument but then I go to other places
[00:36] like Tokyo at the airport and I see
[00:40] people still thinking in terms of gold
[00:42] and cash you know and then I'm like no
[00:46] hell no we're not there yet you know
[00:48] we're not there yet we're not even near
[00:51] there yet anything other than Bitcoin is
[00:53] a shitcoin anything my favorite shitcoin
[00:56] among all the shitcoins uh is
[01:01] [Music]
[01:04] gold I don't feel comfortable talking
[01:07] about Bitcoin in Persian which is my
[01:09] mother language uh I'm not comfortable
[01:12] speaking German uh about Bitcoin which
[01:16] is actually I speak German better than
[01:19] English and my mother language because I
[01:22] grew up in Germany right but I don't
[01:24] feel comfortable talking in any of these
[01:26] languages about Bitcoin why because we I
[01:30] mean I have learned most of what I have
[01:33] learned about Bitcoin in uh in English
[01:37] you know all the books I read were in
[01:39] English all the podcasts I've listened
[01:40] to were in English so there's not much
[01:43] content uh that I mean now there is
[01:47] thanks to I don't know block trainer
[01:49] Nico and all these guys they're doing an
[01:51] amazing job but back in 2017 when I
[01:54] started learning about Bitcoin there was
[01:56] nothing about Bitcoin in German almost
[01:59] non-existent right there was not much
[02:01] happening so I think that that's
[02:03] probably also one of the main reasons
[02:05] yeah I I never really consumed German
[02:08] content about anything like not like not
[02:11] even even outside of of uh Bitcoin I
[02:15] usually tend to go default English um I
[02:19] don't know why I think I made the switch
[02:21] and I was like oh like it feels good and
[02:23] now it feels I even chat with chat in
[02:26] English just so you know yeah me too me
[02:29] too even even though it wouldn't make
[02:31] like a difference I think I I think I
[02:34] think you know on this topic Robin I
[02:36] think it is highly underestimated the
[02:40] value of being able to actually speak
[02:43] English it's
[02:45] insane how the world actually opens
[02:49] towards you if you if you really speak
[02:52] like English well like for example I'm
[02:55] traveling right now around Asia right
[02:58] and wherever I go
[03:00] uh I was in Hong Kong before I came here
[03:02] I was in South Korea and before that I
[03:04] was in Hong Kong and I was you know uh
[03:06] going to so many places and obviously
[03:09] it's difficult to get around because not
[03:11] everybody speaks perfect English but if
[03:14] you speak English you can get things
[03:16] done everywhere it's insane like uh even
[03:19] if uh you go to really far far away
[03:24] countries nowadays when you speak
[03:26] English like the entire world is open to
[03:30] you you know you you most amount of
[03:32] content about most topics is mostly
[03:35] available mostly in English right in any
[03:39] other language it's very limited right
[03:41] so I I think it's very underestimated
[03:44] especially by people in my home country
[03:47] and in my um and in in in the Dak region
[03:51] because most Germans they don't like
[03:53] speaking English right they they they're
[03:56] I have German friends who actually never
[03:58] got orange pill
[04:00] because they could not speak English
[04:02] well you know and um they were just lazy
[04:05] to you know listen to English podcast
[04:07] because that's not their native language
[04:09] and there was not much in German either
[04:12] so they were like you know what can I
[04:14] learn about Bitcoin in German I'm like
[04:16] okay read the Bitcoin standard there is
[04:19] a German version and the German version
[04:21] it's quite funny by the way if you if
[04:23] you ever have any German version of any
[04:26] English book it's usually this much
[04:29] thicker than the original one because we
[04:31] we we we we we tend to over complicate
[04:34] things in German right this is this is I
[04:36] don't know why like a simple thing you
[04:38] can say in English we we tend to really
[04:41] extend the words to uh five words
[04:44] instead of two words so I don't know
[04:46] it's it's you you can argue it's it's a
[04:48] more complete language than English but
[04:51] I don't know it's just more more
[04:53] complex 100% And I do hope I me the
[04:57] comparison now of like Bitcoin I do hope
[04:59] we come to same conclusion where Bitcoin
[05:01] is kind of the the language of money
[05:03] that the Western world uh uses as a
[05:05] standard there might be in the meantime
[05:08] still other things that that people use
[05:09] maybe in local towns but the the overall
[05:12] World standard will be will be Bitcoin
[05:14] yeah that's that's that's that's that's
[05:16] a that's a good point you know the thing
[05:18] is um people don't actually understand
[05:22] that actually that that money is
[05:25] actually something like a language right
[05:28] it is a language language H it is a
[05:31] language of value and it is actually an
[05:35] international language but um you know
[05:40] coming back to my point hopping around
[05:42] countries you come to realize how
[05:45] inefficient it is to going uh from one
[05:48] currency to another it's so much
[05:51] friction you know it's so
[05:53] insanely um inefficient to actually go
[05:58] in so many places and
[06:00] H having to uh switch so many uh
[06:05] currencies you know um with language
[06:08] that's the same case but with language
[06:10] is a different story because we have we
[06:12] have historically been uh speaking
[06:16] different languages and we have
[06:17] different cultures and so on and so
[06:19] forth right so there's a reason why you
[06:22] have different languages um but there is
[06:25] a universal language which is which is
[06:27] English uh and there is is an emerging
[06:30] Universal uh language for Value which is
[06:34] Bitcoin right um which is spreading and
[06:38] I believe that um it's going to become
[06:41] the
[06:42] dominant language for Value over time
[06:45] and we see it play out I mean you can
[06:48] see it growing from nothing to something
[06:52] crazy and then from something crazy to
[06:55] something that uh people laugh about and
[07:00] uh then you know learn a little bit
[07:02] about and have a little bit of exposure
[07:04] to just in case and then it grows to 10%
[07:09] of their wealth and then it grows to 50%
[07:11] of their wealth and then they're like
[07:13] okay actually let me let me learn about
[07:16] this thing right and then it becomes
[07:18] actually a really really really big
[07:21] topic for a lot of people and people
[07:23] like us like us
[07:25] bitcoiners we are already on that
[07:28] Bitcoin standard and we already speak
[07:30] that language that universal language of
[07:32] value that is uh
[07:36] uncensorable uh
[07:38] Universal uh
[07:40] borderless and
[07:43] Limitless you know I was at the at at
[07:46] the at the Tokyo Airport today Robin I
[07:48] had to think of our podcast today that I
[07:51] need to mention that you know the number
[07:53] one thing they want to know is how much
[07:55] cash do you have with you and if you
[07:57] have any gold bars with you there's a
[08:00] big sign at the exit Customs exit how
[08:03] much gold do you have with you and how
[08:05] much cash do you have with you and I'm
[08:07] like well if if if I would want to enter
[08:12] this country I could store a billion
[08:15] dollar worth of value into the most um
[08:21] into the most
[08:23] Superior monetary protocol Humanity has
[08:27] ever seen which is Bitcoin and I can
[08:30] store it in my brain and just cross the
[08:33] customs and no one will ever know that I
[08:37] just did that right try to beat that try
[08:41] to take a billion dollars worth of value
[08:44] from Tokyo to Hong Kong from Hong Kong
[08:48] to London from London to Brazil without
[08:52] anybody even noticing right this is for
[08:56] me
[08:57] um like
[09:00] it's like it's like a secret right no
[09:02] one knows about it yet it's still so
[09:04] early we're at the 100K almost no one is
[09:07] still like taking this serious no one
[09:10] even with the president of the United
[09:13] States talking about it they're not
[09:15] taking it serious nobody even is still
[09:18] taking it serious no one takes the time
[09:20] to understand this technology and
[09:23] um yeah that's the opportunity right
[09:26] that's the opportunity to learn that's
[09:28] the opportunity to adopt that's the
[09:31] opportunity to be among the early
[09:34] adopters still in my opinion we're still
[09:36] in the ' 90s you I was orange fing
[09:39] someone in the airport in in the in the
[09:42] in the airplane uh was a Saudi guy
[09:44] pretty interesting personality and I was
[09:47] trying to orange pill
[09:49] him and um sorry I lost I lost the one I
[09:53] I lost the what what the thought they
[09:57] lost the thought yeah yeah I just lost
[09:58] the thought
[09:59] what I was what what was I
[10:01] saying about you orange build someone on
[10:04] the on on the on the airplane before
[10:07] before you said something which I I I
[10:10] loved that you said that uh something
[10:12] along those lines like Bitcoin is the
[10:14] biggest secret which nobody's trying to
[10:17] hide that's what I kind of got from it
[10:19] because you said like it's it's a secret
[10:22] uh that that like uh nobody's getting at
[10:25] so we so early I think that's what we oh
[10:28] yeah now I remember yes yes yes yeah
[10:30] yeah yeah so now I remember yeah yeah
[10:32] yeah so so when I was talking to him he
[10:34] was like but isn't it too late for
[10:37] Bitcoin is isn't it too late to buy
[10:40] Bitcoin right now and I was like before
[10:43] I answered him I thought for a second
[10:45] and I was like look we're not at $10,000
[10:48] a coin anymore we're much much higher
[10:51] now so there there could be an argument
[10:54] that you can make that this is already
[10:58] maybe in 2015 of the internet right you
[11:01] could make that argument but then I go
[11:04] to other places like Tokyo at the
[11:07] airport and I see people still thinking
[11:11] in terms of gold and cash you know and
[11:14] then I'm like no hell no we're not there
[11:17] yet you know we're not there yet we're
[11:19] not even near there yet you you know so
[11:22] I I still truly believe that we're in
[11:24] the 90s of the internet this is still
[11:26] extremely early the majority is still in
[11:30] deep Sleep they still don't get it um we
[11:33] have to go to much much higher Val
[11:35] valuations until the vast majority of
[11:38] people will get it and uh will want it
[11:43] and will want to understand it and some
[11:45] people will not even try to understand
[11:47] it they will just adopt it just like
[11:49] people don't understand the internet
[11:51] today and they adopt it you know you
[11:54] don't understand how the internet works
[11:55] but you use it every single day you
[11:58] don't understand how your car works but
[12:00] you use it every single day you don't
[12:02] know how how like how your fridge works
[12:07] but You' use it every single day right
[12:09] and one day there will be a time where
[12:13] no one will understand just like today
[12:15] no one needs to understand how Bitcoin
[12:17] works but people will understand that
[12:20] it's a hard monetary medium it's never
[12:23] going to expand its
[12:25] Supply it
[12:27] is it is anti- fragile it is it is
[12:32] censorship resistant and that's all I
[12:34] need to know I don't need to know how
[12:36] this is accomplished I know that no one
[12:39] can take this form of money away from me
[12:41] I can store it uh securely on a hardware
[12:45] wallet or even on a piece of paper I
[12:48] don't recommend that but you could uh
[12:51] you could even store it in your head I
[12:53] also don't recommend that but you could
[12:55] right and you could take that anywhere
[12:58] with you
[12:59] and that is all you need to understand
[13:02] and right now it looks like something
[13:06] too good to be true this is the stage
[13:08] we're in in my opinion Robin it still
[13:11] feels for a lot of people when you tell
[13:14] them this thing is finite no one can
[13:16] take it away from you you can you can
[13:19] send it from one place of the planet to
[13:21] another place of the planet no one can
[13:23] stop you and no one can inflate it right
[13:27] and when you tell that to someone
[13:28] there's like huh okay whatever like it
[13:32] sounds too good to be true too good to
[13:34] be true so people still don't believe it
[13:37] you know this is the stage we're in I
[13:39] think I love I love that framing of it
[13:42] it seems to be good to be true because
[13:44] that's actually where what a lot of
[13:45] people bring up like oh but that can't
[13:47] be true like that that and that happens
[13:49] and it's also um when people ask me like
[13:52] oh are we too late I always ask okay uh
[13:55] let's say in 2015 the example that you
[13:57] brought up go 20 15 on the street and
[14:00] ask people like oh where you on the
[14:02] internet internet today and like most
[14:04] people like I don't know 50% 60% 80%
[14:07] whatever will say yeah I was on the
[14:09] internet today I was like checking
[14:10] WhatsApp I was on YouTube like whatever
[14:13] um ask now on on the street how many
[14:16] people made a Bitcoin transaction of
[14:19] those 100 people that you ask I don't
[14:21] know like maybe you find one if you're
[14:24] lucky maybe too uh and I think uh we are
[14:28] we before the 2000 in the internet
[14:30] adoption if if you if you uh if you
[14:33] actually look at the adoption and then
[14:36] most people that have Bitcoin right now
[14:39] have like a very small amount like like
[14:41] like we too are very crazy people of
[14:44] having so much money in Bitcoin and so
[14:47] like it it feels it's it's like a bubble
[14:50] like we we are in a very small group of
[14:53] people that actually have a lot of
[14:55] wealth or like percentage wealth of in
[14:57] Bitcoin H but but most people don't like
[15:00] most people just have like 5% like like
[15:01] 2% in Bitcoin so we are very far away
[15:05] from being late in bitco yeah and it
[15:09] feels right at the beginning to have
[15:12] just a little bit and it's fine you know
[15:16] I really like if anybody's listening to
[15:18] this and you're like don't why are you
[15:21] guys so extreme you know what you're
[15:23] right we will sound
[15:25] extreme if we say we're all in
[15:29] but I was that person one day who
[15:32] thought exactly that I was listening to
[15:34] podcasts where I remember it was 2019 or
[15:39] 2020 um podcast with Dan held you know
[15:42] Dan held and he was like I'm all in
[15:45] Bitcoin and but back then it was like I
[15:49] was like bro seriously like I had to I
[15:53] had I had a very big amount like for me
[15:55] for myself that that was a big amount
[15:57] right I had 50% of my wealth in Bitcoin
[16:00] and I was like I'm good you know I'm
[16:02] good I don't want more I'm more than
[16:06] good you know but then this guy comes up
[16:08] and says I'm all in you know and I'm
[16:11] like this guy this guy is crazy like how
[16:14] does he handle this type of volatility
[16:17] on a day-to-day basis it's insane but
[16:19] now I I I understand him because once
[16:23] you actually are long enough in Bitcoin
[16:26] and once you have spent at least least I
[16:29] always say at least a thousand hours at
[16:33] least a thousand hours not 100 that's
[16:36] not enough if you if you spent a 100
[16:38] hours learning about Bitcoin you will
[16:40] have you're good with 20 to 50% of your
[16:43] wealth in Bitcoin but if you have spent
[16:46] at least a thousand hours studying this
[16:49] topic you know and it's not only about
[16:51] Bitcoin it's about so many things around
[16:54] Bitcoin Bitcoin is not one topic that
[16:57] you study you know it's it's something
[17:00] that is interconnected with politics
[17:03] Game Theory um psychology markets
[17:07] Finance so many things you know you you
[17:10] have to study the all of this until you
[17:13] understand why Bitcoin right once you
[17:15] get that idea you will know that there
[17:18] is no other alternative to be in you
[17:22] know and that's when when you when you
[17:26] reach the you know the Tipping Point
[17:28] point of you know why nothing else why
[17:31] Bitcoin only why nothing else you know
[17:34] and that does not mean you should not
[17:36] start a business you know I have a
[17:38] business uh Robin you have a business uh
[17:42] that doesn't mean you should not um do
[17:45] something that you want to you know do
[17:48] because you love it or do something you
[17:51] want to make money with or take risk you
[17:53] know to to to make more
[17:56] money that only means that
[17:59] having Bitcoin or
[18:01] gold does not make sense when you
[18:04] understand
[18:05] Bitcoin that means having Bitcoin or or
[18:10] and real estate does not make sense when
[18:13] you understand Bitcoin same goes for
[18:15] stocks same goes for any alternative
[18:18] asset that is supposed to play a role in
[18:23] your portfolio to act as a stor hold of
[18:27] wealth right because that's what most
[18:30] people are looking for most people are
[18:32] not experts in stocks and can read
[18:35] balance sheet statements and understand
[18:37] the product of every single company and
[18:39] do a Strategic investment who does that
[18:42] right the majority of people just want
[18:44] to keep up with inflation they just want
[18:47] to buy
[18:48] something that stores their wealth over
[18:51] time and hopefully also over space right
[18:54] that's what most people are looking for
[18:56] and the solution to that problem
[18:59] is
[19:00] Bitcoin right so my conclusion after
[19:04] that period when I listened to all of
[19:06] these podcasts was that I need to study
[19:11] this more and the more I studied the
[19:13] more I bought and um it was it was a
[19:18] gradual process you know it was not like
[19:22] I woke up one day and I was like I'm
[19:23] going to sell everything and I'm going
[19:25] to buy Bitcoin and nothing else you know
[19:27] it was like I'm going to start with a
[19:29] little
[19:30] bit then let me have some other coins
[19:33] maybe they're better than Bitcoin I
[19:35] don't know yet right and then it was
[19:38] like uh let me learn a little bit more
[19:40] and buy a little bit more and then you
[19:43] see that it grows by
[19:45] itself and then you're like wait a
[19:47] moment why do I actually have gold let
[19:49] me let me think think over that again
[19:51] you know why do I actually have anything
[19:53] else and over time you know I was like
[19:57] nothing else makes
[20:01] yeah you make you all of a sudden
[20:04] rethink a lot of things uh and you come
[20:07] to a conclusion and you said it best
[20:08] like um you you're like okay what else
[20:11] do I want to hold yeah like my own
[20:12] business okay makes sense uh yeah maybe
[20:15] I want to own the home that I'm living
[20:17] in um I currently don't do that and I
[20:20] don't know if I ever want to do that but
[20:22] if if you need it emotionally and if you
[20:24] want to to build that for for your
[20:26] family I think that's a fair one um
[20:29] and then the other thing is like okay
[20:30] you you you maybe also get a better
[20:33] return of investment if you invest in
[20:35] your own knowledge and and and your own
[20:36] skills uh and family but other than that
[20:41] it's like that all other money can just
[20:44] go into Bitcoin so it's like there's
[20:46] like family there's like business
[20:48] there's your own knowledge there maybe
[20:50] like getting your time back with like
[20:51] making a vacation or whatever or Gap
[20:53] year whatever you want to do uh but
[20:56] other than that it's it's like Bitcoin
[20:59] is is the best one and and I do like how
[21:01] how you how you framed it with like it's
[21:03] okay to also invest in other things than
[21:06] Bitcoin but you really have to Value
[21:08] those things uh to make it sense and not
[21:11] just gamble in some some some shitcoin
[21:13] Casino yes it it's always a question of
[21:17] opportunity cost right so what is my
[21:21] opportunity cost of not holding Bitcoin
[21:24] with
[21:26] gold it's over 50%
[21:29] because Bitcoin has outperformed gold
[21:32] gold more than
[21:34] 50% okay with anything if you measure
[21:38] anything against Bitcoin it's trending
[21:40] down so you have to be very very very
[21:44] very delicate with what you do if you
[21:47] don't have the money in Bitcoin right
[21:49] unless we're talking about like I I said
[21:54] that in our first podcast I'm going to
[21:55] say that again Robin there's an
[21:57] exception
[21:59] which is shortterm cash right bitcoin's
[22:03] short-term price action is highly
[22:05] unpredictable you cannot count on its
[22:08] price action over the short term not
[22:11] going to happen you cannot rely on it so
[22:14] you have to have some cash savings for
[22:18] the next I don't know
[22:20] year you know unless you have so much
[22:23] Bitcoin that you don't care even if the
[22:25] price crashes you're fine you know
[22:27] that's a different story but if you
[22:29] cannot sell your Bitcoin if it goes
[22:32] under I don't know 40,000 or $30,000 per
[22:36] per
[22:36] Bitcoin uh it's just an example number
[22:39] okay I'm not giving any type of
[22:42] prediction about anything but if you do
[22:44] have that in your mind then you
[22:46] definitely need a a cushion of cash that
[22:50] you can sustain a possible bare market
[22:54] right because we know if Bitcoin goes
[22:57] down
[22:59] uh in a bare Market scenario it goes
[23:01] down really hard and it stays down for a
[23:03] very long period of time but when it
[23:06] rips up it rips up big right so um
[23:11] that's the only thing that I would maybe
[23:13] encourage everybody to consider if they
[23:17] invest money or if they hold Bitcoin you
[23:20] need to have some cash on the side in
[23:22] case uh you need it for whatever reason
[23:26] uh because you never know what's going
[23:28] to happen maybe you're going to lose
[23:29] your job tomorrow maybe uh you're going
[23:32] to have an you're going to you're going
[23:34] to have an accident tomorrow you never
[23:37] know right you you need some cash on the
[23:40] side um but one other thing I I want to
[23:42] say uh Robin on on what you said uh
[23:45] which is having something else right
[23:49] other than Bitcoin like a house for
[23:51] example um my philosophy in life is the
[23:57] following I
[23:59] believe life is about having
[24:03] experiences right you want to have
[24:06] experiences in life it's all about
[24:10] experiences it's not about owning
[24:13] something on your
[24:16] name that doesn't have for me personally
[24:19] that does not have any value that is
[24:23] completely worthless to me if I can call
[24:26] a house mine
[24:29] because a paper that the government has
[24:31] approved say so that does not add to my
[24:35] experience of life you know what I'm
[24:38] saying what does add exper like value to
[24:42] my life is to experience different
[24:45] things in life that I always want to
[24:48] experience like traveling for
[24:50] example right like having like
[24:54] experiencing a nice house and I'm not
[24:56] saying having a nice house I'm saying
[24:58] experiencing an ice house why do I use
[25:01] this term because you do not necessarily
[25:05] have to own a house to have the
[25:10] experience of um using a
[25:14] house okay you can have an amazing house
[25:19] or experience an amazing house by
[25:21] renting it why would you do that
[25:24] financially it's much more intelligent
[25:26] to do that and obviously it depends
[25:28] depends on your life situation maybe you
[25:31] you see a house that you love and you
[25:33] can only buy it that's the only way to
[25:35] experience it that's a different story
[25:38] but for most people the reason they want
[25:41] to own their house is not that the
[25:44] reason they want to own their house is
[25:46] they think I want to own something I can
[25:49] touch because that's a good
[25:52] investment that's a good thing because I
[25:55] can rely on its value
[25:58] that's the error here right oh that's a
[26:01] very interesting metric yes exactly I I
[26:05] just wanted to bring it up because I
[26:06] think it's it's such an obvious one um
[26:09] no matter what what time frame you're
[26:11] looking at uh all houses are crashing
[26:14] down against the Bitcoin price forever
[26:17] since Bitcoin is there yes absolutely
[26:21] that's the proof right no no real estate
[26:24] investor wants to look at this but
[26:27] that's the hard truth
[26:28] if you price your real estate in terms
[26:31] of Bitcoin it goes down forever forever
[26:36] it's going to become cheaper and cheaper
[26:39] and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper
[26:41] right so you have to ask yourself is it
[26:44] really the
[26:46] experience of using a house that you
[26:49] want in your life or is it owning a
[26:52] house that you want in your life for me
[26:56] it's the experience so why should I go
[27:01] and put over $3 million in
[27:05] liquidity in a piece of real estate that
[27:09] is completely
[27:11] overpriced because of bunch of uh Market
[27:14] participants who believe it's a good
[27:16] store of value why would I do
[27:19] that I would rather rent it from the guy
[27:24] who has parked his money into this uh
[27:27] piece of real EST
[27:29] states have the experience of it and
[27:33] hold Bitcoin instead that's a much more
[27:35] intelligent thing to do whereas if I
[27:39] want to own that house on paper I have
[27:42] to sell $3 million worth of bitcoin I
[27:46] have to buy the
[27:47] house and the bit the house goes down in
[27:52] price when you when you when you
[27:54] calculate it in Bitcoin
[27:56] terms why should I do that right so
[27:59] there is no mathematical or logical
[28:02] reason to do this and the reason why
[28:06] this happens
[28:07] is
[28:09] housing was never meant to be a store of
[28:12] value housing was meant to be for
[28:16] housing for
[28:18] having a house or
[28:21] a we say in German having a roof over
[28:24] your head right that's the main purpose
[28:27] of having a house actually actually but
[28:29] because our monetary system is
[28:31] completely distorted and broken people
[28:34] have used houses as a store of value
[28:37] that's why they're not priced
[28:39] appropriately so if you want to buy a
[28:42] house today you have to pay that
[28:45] premium right so right now and this
[28:49] might change in the future in maybe 20
[28:51] years I don't
[28:53] know maybe when we are on a Bitcoin
[28:55] standard it will be different right but
[28:57] right right now houses most of them are
[29:01] way overpriced so if you ask me um do I
[29:05] want to have a house absolutely do I
[29:08] want to buy a house absolutely not do I
[29:11] want to experience a nice house
[29:13] absolutely yes how do I afford it by
[29:16] renting it and you know what I will be
[29:19] the free person who can move whenever I
[29:22] want the guy who owns the house cannot
[29:25] do that if you own a house
[29:28] and especially if you have put leverage
[29:31] in it if you have taken a loan to
[29:34] purchase it because you don't have you
[29:35] didn't have the capital to do so you
[29:38] might think you did an intelligent
[29:39] decision but you have basically trapped
[29:43] yourself because now the bank will chase
[29:47] you to pay this off no matter where you
[29:50] go and you have to make this payment
[29:53] every single month every single month so
[29:56] you're trapped you cannot leave whereas
[29:58] if I rent the
[30:00] house I can just cancel this lease
[30:03] anytime I want and
[30:06] leave right so you're paying with your
[30:09] freedom you're paying with your uh
[30:11] capital and you're paying with your
[30:13] opportunity cost so if you consider all
[30:16] of this and still say but I but the
[30:19] house costs me less than 1% of my total
[30:22] Bitcoin wealth and I really want this
[30:25] house I don't want anything else I've
[30:28] looked everywhere in the rental market
[30:32] the house that I want does not exist
[30:35] then you should then you should buy it
[30:37] you know but don't treat it as an
[30:39] investment because it's
[30:41] not it's purely um uh it's purely not an
[30:47] investment but a consumption good in the
[30:51] moment you purchase it to experience it
[30:54] it's a consumption good and it should be
[30:56] treated as such that that's my opinion
[30:58] about houses let's take a break for a
[31:01] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[31:03] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[31:07] watches those watches are the most
[31:09] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[31:12] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[31:15] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[31:18] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:21] watch collections you have the date of
[31:24] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[31:27] there and of course also the block
[31:29] height and which EPO we are currently in
[31:33] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:36] in this masterpiece make sure to check
[31:38] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[31:41] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[31:43] those watches so so much and now if you
[31:47] have Bitcoin I really do hope that you
[31:49] don't have it on Exchange but if you do
[31:52] have it on Exchange I have two ways for
[31:54] you to deal with that the first way is
[31:56] you put it on a hardware wallet that's
[31:58] the entry for you to get into the self
[32:01] custody game I recommend bitbox Bitcoin
[32:05] only Edition for that it's a super
[32:07] simple and secure way and if you check
[32:10] out the link in the description you even
[32:12] get 5% off if you use the code Robin and
[32:15] the second way is the Bitcoin way the
[32:18] Bitcoin way is your Allin partner in
[32:22] terms of how to get the most out of your
[32:25] sovereignty they will personalize for
[32:28] you a self custody setup that is perfect
[32:30] for your individual situation they will
[32:33] show you how you can secure your own
[32:36] devices securing your Bitcoin is not
[32:38] enough you also have to keep all your
[32:40] devices secure one topic that is
[32:43] overlooked often is the inheritance plan
[32:46] what happens with your Bitcoin once you
[32:49] are no longer here do you have a plan
[32:51] for that in place already and last but
[32:54] not least if you're in a jurisdictions
[32:56] where you don't feel safe it's better to
[32:58] get a plan B for all that head over to
[33:01] the Bitcoin way.com
[33:04] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[33:07] just a quick side note I will be for the
[33:10] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[33:13] Prague event in June it will be
[33:15] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[33:17] looking forward to seeing all of you
[33:20] there you can get your ticket in the
[33:22] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[33:24] Brock and very important use code Robin
[33:27] get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[33:30] looking forward seeing you there it's
[33:32] crazy that a consumption good can go up
[33:35] over time uh it's like it just it shows
[33:37] how broken our monetary system is
[33:40] actually is like you buy it and five
[33:42] years later the house is in a worse
[33:47] shape uh it needs way more renovation
[33:50] than five years ago and it's worth more
[33:53] I'm like oh like okay that that shows
[33:55] that the monitor system is not that good
[33:57] because not worth more it's priced
[34:00] higher yeah priced it's priced higher
[34:04] but it's not worth more that's the
[34:06] problem and you know Robin it's
[34:08] interesting I mean in Germany or in
[34:11] Austria where you live it's not the case
[34:13] yet but in my home country where I am
[34:16] from in
[34:17] Iran the same happens with cars already
[34:22] like there there there are cars you buy
[34:24] them and because uh of sanction
[34:28] and because of supply chain issues and
[34:30] so on and so forth inflation even
[34:33] happens on cars like you might have
[34:37] bought a car five years ago that is
[34:39] worth more today than five years ago in
[34:42] in local currency that's something
[34:44] Unthinkable in Germany like in Germany
[34:47] when you buy a car immediately after you
[34:50] buy it it's worth at least 20%
[34:53] less at least
[34:55] right always but when the monetary
[34:58] system breaks even
[35:01] further the Distortion becomes so
[35:04] irrational that even cars are
[35:07] mispriced right and at at the end game
[35:11] of this is that the supply chains will
[35:14] break like the supermarkets will be
[35:17] empty that's the that's a horror
[35:19] scenario of inflation right if you look
[35:22] at the uh hyperinflation that happened
[35:25] in
[35:26] Venezuela if you there is pictures on
[35:28] the internet if you check pre prein
[35:31] hyperinflation and after hyperinflation
[35:33] you have the supermarket guy chubby guy
[35:36] with lots of groceries behind him and
[35:38] after hyperinflation he's super slim
[35:41] almost a skeleton and behind him the
[35:44] supermarket is almost empty like real
[35:46] pictures the same guy you
[35:49] know that's what inflation does you know
[35:52] the end game is it breaks the supply
[35:55] chain you will have less Goods in the
[35:59] economy you will have less available
[36:01] Goods in the economy and uh it just
[36:03] breaks Society you know that's the end
[36:06] game of it but I just hope it won't
[36:08] happen in our lifetime where we live or
[36:10] where we are spending time it it won't
[36:13] happen if if you have if you're
[36:15] personally on a Bitcoin standard then
[36:18] then you then you are safe against a lot
[36:21] of this things obviously the the world
[36:23] can still be a mess around you but I I
[36:26] do hope
[36:28] yeah I do hope if the houses which is
[36:31] really interesting like I I will be my
[36:33] mid 40s uh in 20 years so now 26 in 20
[36:37] years 46 and I hope um that at that
[36:41] point housing uh is so cheap and
[36:44] recognized as a um consumption good and
[36:48] and and Bitcoin suck the financial
[36:51] energy out of it it actually makes sense
[36:53] again to to buy a house versus renting
[36:55] it because I think if the monetary
[36:57] premium goes goes down at some point it
[36:59] makes sense to to to own things again
[37:03] because they don't have a monetary PR
[37:05] premium it's just a consumption good but
[37:07] but Robin that's not going to
[37:10] stop in terms of uh
[37:13] dollars but it has already begun in
[37:16] terms of Bitcoin so this is already like
[37:20] for you and for me this is already
[37:23] reality because like I love how Jeff boo
[37:26] puts it you know he was already also on
[37:28] your podcast I I I think you've also
[37:30] spoken with him about this he puts it in
[37:33] such a beautiful way for us that's
[37:35] already reality we are already
[37:39] experiencing the the real Market which
[37:43] is a consumption good such such as a
[37:47] house has to go down in price not up in
[37:51] price and if you hold Bitcoin you are
[37:55] already in that reality you don't have
[37:57] to wait until you're 40 plus years old
[38:00] until you can experience that you just
[38:03] have to like maybe you're not ready to
[38:06] buy the house with your stack with your
[38:08] Bitcoin stack yet but you will be at
[38:10] some point it's just a question of time
[38:13] right that's the thing right that's the
[38:16] thing you're and it's it's it's it's
[38:19] it's pretty crazy because it actually
[38:21] flips everything in your head Bitcoin
[38:24] flips everything in your head it's like
[38:29] actually because it's scarce no it's
[38:31] actually not scarce right it's it's it's
[38:33] finite so because it's finite over time
[38:38] you it actually has to decrease over
[38:40] time your stack has to decrease over
[38:43] time okay you I mean you have to be very
[38:46] productive that it increases over time
[38:48] but at some point it has to decrease
[38:51] over time because at some point you're
[38:53] going to start consuming rather than
[38:55] producing right you will be at at some
[38:57] point a net
[39:00] consumer because you're going to age
[39:02] because you're going to produce less at
[39:04] some point right so at some point it
[39:07] will go
[39:08] down right but it will buy also more
[39:11] over time that's the beauty of Bitcoin
[39:14] will also be fun like with employees and
[39:17] stuff like that where uh all of the
[39:19] sudden the employer has to argue for a
[39:23] lower salary each year yes because every
[39:27] the prices will go down but they get
[39:29] maybe less Sates but the satosi buy more
[39:32] than than previous years so they have
[39:34] more purchasing power but less nominal
[39:37] uh
[39:37] Sates in in the comparisons of what we
[39:40] have now they get more nominal Euros but
[39:44] less purchasing power than last year so
[39:47] it will be a would be a fun thing though
[39:49] in a Bitcoin world where the employer
[39:52] has to argue like like we need less we
[39:55] need to lower your salary yeah yeah and
[39:58] you know it I think we are on on on a
[40:03] really really
[40:05] really fast trajectory to that reality
[40:09] because of the micro environment because
[40:12] of what we're seeing like would you have
[40:15] guessed just a year ago that the
[40:18] president of the most wealthy country in
[40:21] the world would think about putting
[40:25] Bitcoin in its strategic Reserve that's
[40:29] that's absolutely insane like if you
[40:32] would have told me that a year ago I
[40:34] would have said are you like and I'm a
[40:37] bitcoiner right I really believe in
[40:39] Bitcoin but I would have said are you
[40:41] nuts that's not going to happen like all
[40:44] of us we were saying yeah probably you
[40:47] will have El Salvador country
[40:51] likes uh adopting this first and then
[40:55] maybe America will be the last to adopt
[40:58] because they have the most to
[41:00] lose because of the dollar right that
[41:03] that's what everybody was saying but
[41:06] today we just had um
[41:11] the what's what's the name of the guy uh
[41:14] the Howard lutnick yeah Howard nudnik
[41:17] who is the crypto
[41:20] um strategic Reserve uh responsible
[41:25] uh I don't know uh is he the Secretary
[41:29] of um what's his role in in the
[41:32] government uh it's the Secretary of
[41:35] Commerce uh Howard Secretary of yeah
[41:37] Howard Willam mutnik um and is the 30
[41:41] 41st United States Secretary of Commerce
[41:44] uh since this year basically so he is in
[41:48] charge uh among David saaks I believe to
[41:52] basically take care of this strategic uh
[41:55] uh Bitcoin SL crypto Reserve okay and he
[41:59] just announced by the way that cryptos
[42:02] will not be included in that strategic
[42:04] Reserve they will be treated uh
[42:07] friendlier than before but they will not
[42:09] be includ it doesn't make even even
[42:11] Brian Armstrong who is the biggest uh
[42:14]  coiner of all coiners who's
[42:16] the CEO of coinbase says we should not
[42:19] have uh altcoin Reserve or even any
[42:23] altcoin in the bit in in the Strategic
[42:25] reserve of of the US so so uh just to
[42:28] get that out of the way it I believe it
[42:31] will be a at least mainly over
[42:35] 95% Bitcoin strategic Reserve nothing
[42:38] else not nothing else makes sense
[42:41] nothing um but it's absolutely insane to
[42:47] even think about that this is happening
[42:50] you know um I think people are not
[42:52] bullish enough they still don't
[42:54] understand what's happening and uh
[42:57] if the US does this Russia will
[43:00] follow if Russia follows China will
[43:04] follow if China follows uh South Korea
[43:08] will follow everybody will follow if the
[43:10] US follows everybody will follow
[43:12] everybody will will form more in yeah
[43:14] and I just wanted for for the people
[43:16] that uh that maybe don't know what what
[43:18] we're talking about um that I think it
[43:20] just came out yesterday uh this podcast
[43:23] will come out one or two weeks later so
[43:26] it will be maybe already the old news uh
[43:28] but he basically said that Bitcoin
[43:31] strategic Reserve is something that the
[43:33] president is interested in and it will
[43:34] be probably executed this Friday so in
[43:36] two days so one two weeks ago when you
[43:39] see this now uh and what's really
[43:42] interesting is Bitcoin is one thing and
[43:44] then the other currencies the other
[43:46] crypto tokens I think will be treated
[43:49] differently positively but differently
[43:52] so that's really really important uh and
[43:55] that's where I had a little bit of
[43:57] problem with the first announcement of
[43:58] of Donald Trump of like oh like we add
[44:00] Solana and ethereum and all those things
[44:02] like ah this this clear line between
[44:05] Bitcoin and crypto that was made the
[44:08] last years uh which is super positive
[44:11] and super important was kind of getting
[44:14] washed away again and thankfully Howard
[44:18] lutnick and and hopefully also the
[44:20] president now draws that line again of
[44:23] like there is Bitcoin and then there's
[44:27] everything else we need that line is
[44:29] super important especially in my opinion
[44:32] for for people that are new and enormous
[44:35] because I remember when I came into
[44:38] Bitcoin the the first question after I
[44:41] kind of understood Bitcoin I was like
[44:42] okay what what what is with all the
[44:44] other current coins and then I was
[44:46] researching ethereum researching all the
[44:48] other tokens and I was like oh okay
[44:50] that's so confusing and then I was like
[44:53] okay let's focus on bitcoin but if we
[44:55] really separate that out
[44:58] then it makes more sense if you research
[45:00] gold you don't start to research like oh
[45:02] like this other token also so you really
[45:05] need to to get it done I think Howard
[45:08] link did a great job with that yeah he's
[45:11] a bitcoiner he's a bitcoiner he really
[45:13] is a bitcoiner I think he was on uh
[45:16] Pompano's podcast before he was part of
[45:19] the government and uh he made some
[45:23] insane statements about Bitcoin I think
[45:25] he has billions of dollars personally in
[45:28] Bitcoin you know he is a he's a very
[45:32] very very
[45:34] um Pro Bitcoin personality and he's in
[45:38] charge of this strategic Reserve so um
[45:42] yeah I think by the time this podcast
[45:43] will Air we probably will already have
[45:46] an announcement about the Strategic
[45:48] reserve and uh the price will be maybe
[45:52] higher maybe lower I don't know I'm I'm
[45:54] not going to speculate but um it's
[45:56] dangerous
[45:58] yeah it's like I don't know man maybe it
[46:00] will be a sell the news event you you
[46:02] never know you never know yeah but yeah
[46:05] but it it really also depends um for for
[46:08] like shortterm Market demands it really
[46:10] depends on like how he phrases things
[46:12] and how Trump is announcing it so you
[46:15] really never like you have no clue
[46:17] what's going to happen in two weeks um
[46:20] but we we can know directly what will
[46:22] happen in the next 20 years um we also
[46:25] talked about that last time actually uh
[46:27] not the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve uh but
[46:29] about the gradually and then suddenly
[46:32] phas how how much close are we now to
[46:36] the suddenly phase I think last time you
[46:37] said we are still in the gradual phase
[46:40] what what happened I think the last time
[46:42] we were on was like July uh so it's a
[46:46] more than half a year uh uh away already
[46:50] what would we say happened kind of like
[46:52] in the last few months I the thing is
[46:56] Robin I have a very nuanced opinion
[46:59] about this gradually then suddenly
[47:01] moment um I
[47:04] think this is because Bitcoin is a
[47:07] global monetary asset you will have uh
[47:12] suddenly moments in some places and
[47:15] still gradual moments in some other
[47:18] places you know um gold did not do that
[47:22] and the reason why gold did not do that
[47:25] was because
[47:27] gold was
[47:29] local gold was not uh able to
[47:34] travel okay H this is why gold took
[47:37] thousands of years to be adopted right
[47:42] this thing lives on the internet so this
[47:45] thing
[47:47] is
[47:49] uh in one place a store of value in
[47:53] another place still a nothing burger and
[47:56] in a different place already a medium of
[47:58] exchange right so it is very hard to say
[48:02] where it's going to go
[48:03] but let me say it that way if a
[48:07] government like the United States has
[48:11] someone like Michael
[48:13] sailor as one of the people who advises
[48:16] right now the
[48:18] SEC and who is invited to the crypto
[48:21] event of the uh president of the US to
[48:25] talk about this topic
[48:27] and if you have spent
[48:29] maybe three or four
[48:32] podcasts with
[48:33] SA or listen to him or listen to Robin's
[48:37] podcast with sa I highly recommend that
[48:40] episode anybody listening go back and
[48:42] listen to that one it's a really good
[48:43] one if you have listened to that person
[48:46] you know that this person
[48:50] is extremely
[48:53] convincing and has the most amount of
[48:57] incentive to make this
[49:00] happen Okay um and and really
[49:04] understands this topic right so they
[49:06] have really good people around them
[49:08] David saaks I'm not really sure if I
[49:10] trust that guy he he's been into Solana
[49:14] before and I know that he he had a bag
[49:17] of Solana that he dumped on retail uh on
[49:20] their podcast with
[49:22] um uh with the other guys with with his
[49:25] billionaire friends and so on and so
[49:27] forth I'm not sure about him but uh I'm
[49:31] pretty sure that you have people like
[49:33] sailor who are very close to the
[49:35] government right now and they are going
[49:38] to educate these people and if these
[49:42] people in in these type of positions are
[49:45] educated on this topic I think you're
[49:48] going to see a wave of
[49:52] adoption that is no I I should I should
[49:55] phrase it differently it's not called
[49:56] adoption because adoption is something
[49:59] that you see on uh you know on the real
[50:02] economy right adoption will be slower
[50:06] than this okay but this is going to pump
[50:11] the price of Bitcoin very rapidly up
[50:14] because the amount of money that can go
[50:16] into the Bitcoin network if a government
[50:19] like the United States decides to buy it
[50:23] is freaking insane if you compare it to
[50:26] adoption okay adoption very very
[50:28] important distinction here it like we
[50:31] can have a gradually then suddenly
[50:33] moment for the price of Bitcoin but not
[50:36] a suddenly moment in the adoption of
[50:38] Bitcoin although one helps the other
[50:41] right because if the price of Bitcoin
[50:42] goes up you will also have more people
[50:45] adopting it but you don't know if it's a
[50:47] healthy adoption or a speculative
[50:49] adoption right speculative adoption is
[50:52] not good right it's it's a bubble right
[50:54] we don't like speculative speculative
[50:57] adoption but long story short I think if
[51:01] this strategic Reserve is is is is
[51:04] announced and
[51:06] executed executed it's going to um boost
[51:10] the price of Bitcoin it's going to
[51:12] increase the probability of us
[51:15] having a a wave of new people pouring in
[51:20] just like we do every four years and I
[51:23] know everybody said that in the last
[51:25] cycle I know everybody said that in the
[51:27] cycle before that but I'm going to say
[51:30] it again we might have we might have a
[51:36] cycle where because of derivatives
[51:40] because of the massive um micro
[51:44] situation or macro situation that we
[51:47] have worldwide because of governments
[51:49] now being
[51:50] involved that we don't see such a
[51:54] dreadful bare Market like we did last
[51:57] time it is possible it's I mean I'm not
[52:00] saying we're not going to see
[52:01] corrections but a blood bath we saw last
[52:05] time for over two years with 70 plus
[52:10] perc uh draw down right it is possible
[52:14] that we're not going to see a repetition
[52:16] of that it's not out of the out of the
[52:18] table but it is possible and that's for
[52:21] me a suddenly moment if you ask me
[52:23] that's a suddenly moment
[52:26] it's interesting yeah also the the the
[52:30] distinction between price and adoption
[52:32] which is very different even though they
[52:34] influence themselves but it's a very uh
[52:38] different of like how many people
[52:40] actually have already a hardware wallet
[52:42] versus what is the price of Bitcoin I'm
[52:45] sure they're somehow correlated uh but
[52:48] they are uh it's not the same thing
[52:51] because if the price shoots up tomorrow
[52:53] 50% I'm sure that uh hard wallet sales
[52:58] will also not go up 50%
[53:00] because they they take longer like just
[53:03] because the price shots up like there's
[53:05] some correlation but like also some lag
[53:07] and and some uh some some actual
[53:10] physicality in there also usually
[53:13] Hardware wallet sales goes up when
[53:15] there's a hack on an exchange that's
[53:17] when that that's when that's when
[53:20] Hardware wallet sales goes up so buy bid
[53:22] was good yeah I mean every hack on an
[53:25] exchange is good for for for self-
[53:29] custody adoption which brings me also to
[53:31] my my last topic actually today we we
[53:33] talked in July last time and and I think
[53:35] for 21st capital A lot has happened the
[53:38] the last couple of months um uh for the
[53:41] people that don't know about 21st
[53:43] capital or what you're doing uh what are
[53:45] you doing uh and and what kind of have
[53:48] you worked on in the past couple
[53:50] months so we started 21st with uh you
[53:54] know with with the vision of helping
[53:59] individuals and um companies to store
[54:05] their Bitcoin in a very very secure way
[54:08] without the downside of self-
[54:12] custody and uh we use a very in
[54:17] Innovative way to do that um which
[54:21] basically puts the user in complete
[54:24] control
[54:26] but without the risk of actually losing
[54:31] their coins ever right and uh that was
[54:36] initially the vision and we started with
[54:41] just you know a few clients and we got
[54:45] really great feedback ever since and uh
[54:48] we have now I can I can I can with
[54:51] confidence say uh over 20 Bitcoin
[54:57] uh ever since I spoke with you last time
[55:00] of
[55:01] growth uh in doing a collaborative
[55:05] custody with clients and
[55:09] um
[55:11] the the obviously we don't hold the
[55:14] Bitcoin right it's it's a collaborative
[55:15] custody model but we do have safety net
[55:20] or rescue Keys available in case the
[55:22] clients lose their Bitcoin right that's
[55:24] that's what we are solving BAS basically
[55:27] and um we really believe that this is
[55:31] the future of doing self- custody
[55:34] because self- custody is just
[55:38] not secure over long periods of time for
[55:42] the average user right normally
[55:46] exchanges have abused this insecurity
[55:49] and they have advised clients to not
[55:52] withdraw their coins which is good for
[55:54] them because they can work with the
[55:55] money right but our approach is we have
[56:00] built a platform for people to be able
[56:03] to take self custody very securely
[56:06] through our help and with safety um
[56:12] rescue backups that will help them in
[56:16] case they're in an emergency in case
[56:19] they lose their keys in case they pass
[56:22] away in case they forget something you
[56:26] know there's so many things that can
[56:28] happen because if you are long enough in
[56:30] Bitcoin you know this is not something
[56:31] you hold for a year this is something
[56:34] you want to hold for Generations right
[56:37] so we really try to help people to build
[56:40] their their a very robust inheritance
[56:43] plan that no very bulletproof
[56:45] inheritance plan and we take a very
[56:49] personalized approach right we we don't
[56:52] have an approach that is universal for
[56:55] any for everybody right right so the
[56:57] inheritance protocols with us are
[56:59] different for each client because we
[57:02] look at their circumstance we look at
[57:04] their concerns we look at their
[57:07] geographical locations we look at so
[57:10] many things and uh Define The
[57:13] Inheritance plan based on that so that's
[57:15] what we do and um when we uh were
[57:19] talking uh in July last year it was
[57:22] pretty much the beginning when we
[57:24] launched the product and I can really
[57:26] proudly say um obviously you were also a
[57:29] big help for us Robin uh by uh you know
[57:34] also um recording uh podcasts with us
[57:38] and actually spreading the word and
[57:39] coming on our podcast and thank you for
[57:42] that by the way it's really helping us
[57:44] to spread the word that people need to
[57:46] take self- custody we're really
[57:48] passionate about this and um yeah that's
[57:53] that's what we do that's what we do and
[57:55] if anybody interested to find out more
[57:57] about this just visit our website 21st
[58:00] capital.com
[58:01] uh just 21 the letter I mean the the
[58:06] number two number one st capital Al
[58:10] together.com
[58:12] and uh you can schedule a demo or a
[58:15] consultation with us and uh we are going
[58:18] to show you how the uh system can help
[58:22] you secure your Bitcoin I think that's
[58:25] the website said I got that
[58:27] right yes really cool yeah I love that
[58:31] cool I mean it's uh it's uh it's it's
[58:34] really cool what you have done because
[58:36] like uh just in in under year there's
[58:39] been a lot going on uh and I've talked
[58:42] consistently with with you uh so I think
[58:46] it's a it's a really cool service that
[58:47] that you've done and I'm not seeing
[58:49] anyone else do it in in in that exact
[58:52] way and which is really fascinating and
[58:55] if I think most important thing for me
[58:57] always is we need as
[58:59] many uh different ways of self- custody
[59:03] um so we can actually get it to be
[59:07] mainstream in Bitcoin because what I
[59:10] have found is self- custody isn't even
[59:12] mainstream within the Bitcoin Community
[59:15] most Bitcoin has hold their key don't
[59:18] really hold their keys which kind of
[59:20] frustrates me of like um why why not
[59:24] like why are they not go going to to do
[59:27] that when it's so obvious when there's
[59:29] like exchanges hacked all the time when
[59:31] there's Rock PS when there's like FTX
[59:33] there's so many famous examples of
[59:35] people losing their keys while having uh
[59:39] losing their Bitcoin while having it on
[59:41] Exchange yeah and then the whole uh if
[59:43] you hold it on Exchange you you don't
[59:45] you only get number G and not Freedom go
[59:47] up technology and and that whole
[59:49] fundamental part um so yeah I'm I'm I'm
[59:52] always supporting any uh product and
[59:55] service which promotes self- custody in
[59:58] any way shape or form and and do like it
[60:01] so you so you have a really nice service
[60:04] product approach of like there's like a
[60:06] service and a product because there are
[60:07] some things like uh uh the bit key
[60:10] that's kind of more of a product not not
[60:12] a service and then there are pure
[60:14] Services uh so that that's really
[60:16] interesting so yeah thank you so much
[60:18] for for do that I would yeah I would
[60:20] call it more a service than a product uh
[60:23] because it actually is really a
[60:27] designed for people who uh I'm going to
[60:31] be very transparent about this if you
[60:33] don't hold much Bitcoin uh it's probably
[60:35] not worth doing this because uh you know
[60:39] um it's just a very very very white
[60:42] gloved service for somebody who is very
[60:46] concerned about security and wants to
[60:49] store his Bitcoin in an extremely secure
[60:52] way for a very long period of time
[60:55] that's what this service is perfect for
[60:59] so we built actually something we wish
[61:02] somebody offered us when we started our
[61:05] journey in Bitcoin that's that's what we
[61:08] offer is there an a number of Sates or
[61:12] number of Bitcoin that you're like it
[61:14] makes sense to do it it your way right
[61:19] now obviously when when Bitcoin goes up
[61:21] those numbers change probably so it's a
[61:24] dynamic number but is there something
[61:25] that you have in mind of like okay if
[61:27] you have more than that stack it
[61:29] probably makes sense to
[61:31] do yeah the thing is Robin it it
[61:34] actually depends not only on the stack
[61:37] amount but also on the person or company
[61:41] right so if you let me give you an
[61:44] example if you are in your
[61:48] 60s and you
[61:50] have2 Bitcoin and that's all the Bitcoin
[61:54] you have and that's all your wealth
[61:55] actually you don't have more and that's
[61:57] not little money it's like almost
[61:59] $20,000
[62:01] right then you should do this and it's
[62:04] not that expensive by the way like maybe
[62:06] a, bucks and that's it uh and and and
[62:10] every year maybe $300 that's that's not
[62:12] a lot right but then you have a service
[62:16] that is there in case you forget things
[62:20] because at that age it's so so so
[62:23] important that you do this right because
[62:26] if you forget something if you lose your
[62:28] memory if you lose your keys uh in any
[62:32] way then it's it's it's a huge problem
[62:36] but for example if you have one Bitcoin
[62:39] and you're in your 30s and that's like
[62:41] nothing to you even if you know you lose
[62:44] that one Bitcoin you're very wealthy you
[62:47] have a couple of million dollars that's
[62:49] nothing to you then you know maybe uh if
[62:53] you do a single sck on your own Maybe
[62:55] maybe it's fine you know I would still
[62:58] do it but maybe it's fine for now right
[63:01] but as soon as you reach a percentage of
[63:04] let's say five or 10% of your wealth
[63:07] then it's a significant amount of your
[63:09] portfolio and it also depends if you're
[63:12] a Speculator if you're a tourist or if
[63:14] you're a bitcoiner who wants to hold
[63:15] this thing for many many years right
[63:18] that's also a question so if you're a
[63:21] Speculator don't do this it's probably
[63:23] not for you right if you just want to
[63:25] buy Bitcoin hold it for a couple of
[63:27] months and Sell It Again probably best
[63:29] to hold it on an exchange even right but
[63:33] if you want to store uh a a percentage
[63:37] that really matters to you and your
[63:39] portfolio and you take self- custody
[63:42] serious and you want to build checks and
[63:46] balances and security protocols that
[63:50] protect you in case of a disaster then
[63:53] it's the right thing to do for sure
[63:55] absolutely yeah and it's an interesting
[63:57] point of like it it does not only matter
[64:00] what the stack amount is it also matters
[64:02] like how significant that amount to us
[64:05] because for someone one Bitcoin could be
[64:09] the whole life savings and for someone
[64:11] else one Bitcoin is almost nothing
[64:13] because they have so much other wealth
[64:16] uh so that that's an interesting uh
[64:19] comparison and who you are and who you
[64:21] are if you are for example uh we had a
[64:24] client a few a few weeks ago uh he he
[64:28] he's he's new in Bitcoin and he just
[64:30] booked our service to learn self-
[64:33] custody like he he doesn't have much
[64:35] Bitcoin he has only $10,000 and it's
[64:37] nothing to him but he he wants to learn
[64:40] the journey that's why he book the
[64:42] service to learn how this works right so
[64:45] if you're also new to bitcoin you want
[64:46] to learn how self- custody works this is
[64:49] like the best rabbit it's like the best
[64:52] crash course you can take to learn self-
[64:55] custody and maybe after a year you say
[64:57] actually I don't need this I'm young I'm
[64:59] going to do the protocol on my own you
[65:01] don't need the service you can use it
[65:03] for a year and after year after a year
[65:05] say I don't need the rescue key I don't
[65:07] need it I I don't need the service
[65:09] necessarily I'm going to do this on my
[65:10] own also possible interesting uh
[65:14] learning it's like a paid Learning
[65:16] Journey uh because uh some people might
[65:19] have uh money but not the time to learn
[65:21] it themselves uh and so they can
[65:24] basically py for a pay Learning Journey
[65:26] and what better way better way to do it
[65:28] like like that exactly exactly really
[65:32] cool um we have one question that I
[65:34] asked each and every one of my guests
[65:35] and the question is what can we learn
[65:37] from you besides Bitcoin oh gosh you
[65:39] asked me that I think last time already
[65:41] yeah it's I think it's uh really hard uh
[65:44] for returning guests maybe I have to do
[65:46] a second thing for returning guests
[65:48] because no I like up with new new things
[65:52] no I like the question because it's also
[65:53] a little bit philosophical uh uh listen
[65:56] I I I'm a
[65:58] believer
[66:00] of I think you will have a much easier
[66:05] time in life if you believe in yourself
[66:09] if you really really believe in
[66:12] yourself and uh and I love how you say
[66:16] it I I think you said it in one of your
[66:18] podcasts with us or I don't know I I I I
[66:20] saw you somewhere say that the best
[66:24] investment that you can
[66:26] make is in yourself right and by doing
[66:32] that you will find out that it's also
[66:37] the best thing to educate yourself and
[66:40] by doing that you will realize that you
[66:44] will gain something we call
[66:47] self-confidence and self- confidence
[66:50] will make navigating life in general
[66:56] so much easier so much easier you will
[67:00] earn the respect of others you don't
[67:02] have to demand respect from others you
[67:04] will earn it and you will get it by
[67:06] default you don't have to ask for it it
[67:08] goes without saying but to get there you
[67:12] have to invest in yourself you have to
[67:15] put the time to educate yourself you
[67:17] have to put the time to clear your mind
[67:20] from time to time you have to put the
[67:23] time to cleanse your body from time to
[67:26] time and um to take care of your
[67:30] relationships from time to time so I
[67:33] always say it's mind reading
[67:37] educating listening to podcasts of Robin
[67:40] and others learning about Bitcoin right
[67:44] stuff like that the
[67:46] heart all your relationships with your
[67:49] parents with your loved ones with your
[67:52] friends all of these keeping the con
[67:56] because we're social beings right so
[67:59] mind
[68:01] heart Spirit clear your mind from time
[68:04] to time whether it's through
[68:06] meditation some form of religion you can
[68:09] call it whatever you want something that
[68:11] connect connects you with your uh upper
[68:15] self if you will higher self if you will
[68:18] okay uh and last but not least your body
[68:22] watch what you put in your mouth
[68:26] and take care of what God has given you
[68:30] this
[68:31] precious um body that will not exist for
[68:35] very long right it's it's it's it's a
[68:38] gift from the Divine that you need to
[68:40] protect and what's the best way to
[68:42] protect it don't give it crap food and
[68:48] exercise regularly that's what I can I
[68:51] can say about anything other than
[68:53] Bitcoin that's beautiful uh really cool
[68:56] and actually I mentioned it I think uh
[68:57] two weeks ago on the live stream on on
[69:00] your live stream with Momo uh of where I
[69:04] invested or I was prepared to invest my
[69:07] Bitcoin into making my Bitcoin Journey
[69:10] happen but luckily I never had to do
[69:12] that because I had cash flow from from
[69:14] the day one basically uh but I was
[69:17] prepared to to pay myself from my
[69:19] Bitcoin stack uh to make that thing
[69:22] happen and we kind of went into the
[69:24] Journey of like
[69:26] how Bitcoin enabled me to do that so if
[69:28] people are interested in it they can
[69:29] just go to 21st Capital probably like
[69:33] the one of the latest podcasts or like a
[69:35] few weeks back uh you can find it or
[69:38] just 21st capital and Robin S probably
[69:39] on YouTube it will pop up but that's
[69:41] that was a really interesting talk and
[69:44] it's so beautiful also how how you said
[69:46] it and framed it right now um really
[69:48] cool we have as you know and rtin in the
[69:50] podcast where the previous guest is
[69:52] asking a question for the next guest and
[69:54] I I can't can't um this question never
[69:58] came up uh but it's it's a really cool
[70:01] one uh and I'm really looking forward
[70:04] what what a bitcoiner like yourself also
[70:08] says to that what's your favorite
[70:10] shitcoin Ah that's a difficult
[70:13] one yeah like I I when he told me this I
[70:16] was like oh gosh like I don't have one
[70:19] poor next guest poor next guest what's
[70:23] my favorite coin it has to be blunt
[70:27] and just a simple answer right I cannot
[70:29] I cannot ask for any form of definition
[70:32] okay yeah because the the previous guest
[70:35] is not here so that's yeah yeah yeah
[70:38] what's my favorite
[70:40] shitcoin the answer is
[70:43] gold gold I love that I I thought
[70:47] briefly also about real estate no gold
[70:51] you know I I I I Robin I I really really
[70:54] from time to time I'm I'm really honest
[70:58] right now with you on a really serious
[71:00] note sometimes when I do some form of
[71:03] meditation or reflect on the past six or
[71:07] seven years I sometimes think to myself
[71:10] like what would we bitcoiners believe in
[71:14] if Bitcoin didn't exist like what would
[71:17] we do without this technology we would
[71:21] be probably some gold maximalist who run
[71:26] around and you know try to orange pill
[71:29] people about about gold you know so yeah
[71:32] I mean with all the things we say about
[71:35] gold uh I think gold is the second
[71:41] best uh or or the best shitcoin because
[71:45] anything other than Bitcoin is a
[71:47] shitcoin anything and for me the the my
[71:52] my my favorite shitcoin among all the
[71:54]  coins uh is
[71:58] gold I love that really cool I mean I
[72:01] would I think I would actually be still
[72:04] a stock Pro because I was a stock Pro
[72:06] before uh and Bitcoin kind of converted
[72:08] me to the sound money thing I I I I
[72:11] never I always dismissed gold as useless
[72:14] uh before uh and kind of Bitcoin
[72:16] explained to me the value of gold and
[72:18] now I get the value of gold because of
[72:20] Bitcoin so I think without I think
[72:23] without Bitcoin I would still buy like
[72:24] test St in all yeah which was also
[72:28] probably a good it's very hard to it's
[72:30] very hard to say how you would think if
[72:33] things were differently it's very
[72:35] difficult to imposs put yourself yeah
[72:37] it's impossible it's very difficult to
[72:39] judge that absolutely yeah really cool
