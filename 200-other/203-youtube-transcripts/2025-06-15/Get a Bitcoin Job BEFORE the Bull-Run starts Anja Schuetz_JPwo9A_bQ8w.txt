[00:00] everybody thinks oh I want to work in
[00:01] Bitcoin but I'm not a developer you
[00:03] don't have to be a developer that could
[00:04] be a major bull run the next 18 months
[00:07] what is better than a meaningful job
[00:10] that helps you contribute to the very
[00:12] thing that's going to fix the world the
[00:14] Bitcoin job market still is very closely
[00:17] linked to the Bitcoin price many
[00:19] bitcoiners get to a point where they
[00:21] don't want to just Moonlight as a
[00:23] bitcoiner and have a Fiat day job but
[00:26] they just want to move their whole life
[00:28] to bitcoin the Bitcoin space is still
[00:30] very small and most of the companies are
[00:33] startups for regular people to get into
[00:36] Bitcoin they need to see other regular
[00:39] people cbdcs to me is the biggest threat
[00:42] to humanity This Is How They always get
[00:45] us with
[00:50] convenience why should someone work in
[00:52] Bitcoin and build a career in in Bitcoin
[00:55] I don't know if anybody should but many
[00:58] many people really really want to and I
[01:01] mean what is better than a meaningful
[01:04] job um that helps you contribute to the
[01:08] very thing that's going to fix the world
[01:10] I mean that's what we all want
[01:13] right so yeah many many bitcoiners fall
[01:16] down the rabbit hole and there just
[01:17] comes a point where they want to
[01:19] contribute to Bitcoin in some shape or
[01:22] form and there are many ways to do that
[01:24] and some decide to work in Bitcoin and
[01:27] look for jobs with Bitcoin companies so
[01:30] this is where I want to help and uh
[01:32] serve the Bitcoin Community yeah not as
[01:35] a recruiter uh because I don't have a
[01:38] recruiting background and there are
[01:39] already skilled Recruiters in in the
[01:42] ecosystem but really as um a guide or as
[01:46] a resource for the job Seekers uh
[01:50] because recruiters mainly work for
[01:52] employers and uh I saw a niche because
[01:56] my background is in Customer Support
[01:58] customer service so I really am a
[02:00] service person and I chose the job
[02:03] seekers in Bitcoin as my target group to
[02:06] serve and to to contribute to the
[02:09] Bitcoin community so with knowledge with
[02:12] education with connections with an
[02:15] efficient job feed um with things that
[02:18] make their lives easier yeah so that's
[02:20] what we're trying to do at bit vocation
[02:23] yeah interesting what it was so you are
[02:27] acting more like as a um resource for
[02:30] people that want to get a a Bitcoin job
[02:33] uh but maybe have struggles starting
[02:35] with that what advice do you have for
[02:36] for people that are right now like oh I
[02:38] have a good job I feel comfortable but
[02:40] actually I have a lot of Bitcoin and I
[02:42] want to actually also contribute to
[02:43] bitcoin uh in a meaningful way what
[02:46] advice do you have uh for for them they
[02:48] seeking a Bitcoin
[02:50] job yeah that was a lot of questions and
[02:53] there's a lot of advice for different
[02:55] parts of that um if you're in a
[02:58] comfortable job like a Fiat job job and
[03:00] stability and security is important to
[03:02] you then I would not advise you to work
[03:04] in Bitcoin because if you're looking for
[03:06] job security Bitcoin is not the right
[03:08] place uh because bit the Bitcoin job
[03:11] market still is very closely linked to
[03:14] the Bitcoin price so there are a lot
[03:16] more jobs in the bull market when prices
[03:19] are high and when teams simply have more
[03:22] money to hire people and yeah the
[03:24] opposite is the case in a bare Market uh
[03:27] there are a lot less jobs teams have
[03:29] less money money and the job market is
[03:31] more skewed towards developers uh I
[03:34] think developers are sort of okay they
[03:37] will always find jobs also in the bare
[03:39] Market but all the nonde jobs um there
[03:42] is a little bit of an up and down which
[03:44] we can also uh which we hopefully will
[03:46] be able to see in our data that we are
[03:48] collecting in bit vocation now so um but
[03:52] there are many people who are sitting in
[03:53] Fiat jobs and they are nice and stable
[03:56] but maybe stability is not one of their
[03:58] values maybe freedom and meaningful work
[04:02] is um I mean that is um also something
[04:05] that bit that unites bitcoiners um
[04:08] Freedom truth privacy transparency and
[04:11] everything and so yeah many bitcoiners
[04:14] get to a point where they don't want to
[04:17] just Moonlight as a bitcoiner and have a
[04:20] Fiat day job but they just want to move
[04:22] their whole life to bitcoin and uh be
[04:25] fully aligned with it that happened to
[04:27] me I assume that happened to you as well
[04:30] I don't know what you did before but I'm
[04:33] sure there's a reason why you decided to
[04:35] do a Bitcoin podcast and go fulltime and
[04:39] um yeah so people need to check what are
[04:41] their values what do they need um
[04:43] because if you have a family to feed
[04:45] then maybe just moving quitting your
[04:48] Fiat job and and moving to bitcoin might
[04:50] not be the best idea maybe then focus on
[04:53] being the bitcoiner at your Fiat job
[04:56] maybe you can be more useful there but
[04:58] yeah for other people like for me
[05:00] Freedom um is much more important than
[05:04] security I will provide my security by
[05:06] holding Bitcoin and I'm used to the ups
[05:09] and downs um of working in Bitcoin so
[05:14] that's something really important to
[05:16] know for anybody who wants to make the
[05:18] switch Yeah I think that's uh that's
[05:21] great I mean just quickly to my story I
[05:24] as I it's been a while since I mentioned
[05:27] it on the podcast um I actually
[05:30] was very satisfied with my job I really
[05:32] liked it uh I was getting really good
[05:35] promotions i l the things that I did I
[05:38] Lov the environment the only thing I
[05:40] didn't like was the content of it it was
[05:43] cyber security which is an amazing F
[05:45] like it's really exciting there's a lot
[05:46] going on in cyber security uh it's like
[05:49] one of the fastest growing Industries
[05:52] right now as uh cyber as Internet
[05:55] Security is more and more important and
[05:57] privacy and all those things um but
[06:00] Bitcoin was more exciting so I had to so
[06:02] I had the choice like oh do do I want to
[06:06] make something exciting or do I want to
[06:08] have something that is the most exciting
[06:10] thing for me and as I'm young and 25 I'm
[06:13] able to take a little bit of risks and I
[06:15] was like yeah let's let's jump into it
[06:16] and yeah I'm I'm I'm still fine I'm
[06:18] still living I'm still I can still pay
[06:20] my bills Soh it's it's a it's it's great
[06:24] that you can do it but yeah as you said
[06:26] like circumstances are playing a big
[06:28] role like maybe maybe you're not 25
[06:30] maybe you're 45 maybe you're 50 maybe
[06:32] you have kids maybe you have uh a wife
[06:35] maybe you have a family that that you
[06:36] have to feed or they relying on you
[06:38] maybe have something else that yeah you
[06:42] you have then it's like harder to do the
[06:44] switch I also talked with bitcoiners
[06:46] that are like 58 years old they have a
[06:49] big income they have like 300 400,000 a
[06:51] year salary and they're like oh I would
[06:54] love to dedicate my life to bitcoin but
[06:56] those salaries are not in Bitcoin only
[06:58] companies so it's really hard to switch
[07:01] I mean that's a luxury problem that they
[07:02] have but uh still like there's a lot of
[07:04] circumstances where like maybe it's not
[07:06] the best and then we come to this
[07:09] interesting thing where being a
[07:11] bitcoiner in a non-bitcoin
[07:15] company is really exciting because you
[07:19] can bring this orange light into a new
[07:21] environment like we should not all like
[07:24] grow in our go in our Echo Chambers and
[07:27] and stay there like being a bit coin
[07:29] Warrior let's say it like that in the
[07:32] Fiat company and and say and bringing
[07:34] the knowledge in the lunch breaks to
[07:37] about Bitcoin I think that's a really um
[07:40] really good thing uh to do and I'm so
[07:43] proud that there are now two free bit
[07:45] Corners in my old job that are now doing
[07:48] that instead of me even though I'm not
[07:51] there anymore because I was long enough
[07:52] there and if we assume uh that every
[07:57] company will be a Bitcoin company at
[07:58] some point then the people who stayed
[08:02] and who are right now the bitcoiners
[08:04] they might set themselves up for really
[08:06] good positions at that point because
[08:08] where are their management teams going
[08:10] to go when they need advice uh to the
[08:13] guy who's been talking and preaching
[08:14] about Bitcoin for five years or
[08:17] something but um you asked me for advice
[08:19] but you can also give advice to to
[08:22] people who want to make the jump because
[08:23] you did it you changed you quit your job
[08:26] and you started a Bitcoin business so
[08:28] what would your advice be to to people
[08:32] who want to do the
[08:33] same I think it's really important uh I
[08:37] mean I think you talked actually about
[08:38] about that in a in a recent podcast that
[08:40] I I saw from from you you have to show
[08:43] the proof of work like um when you want
[08:46] to do uh a Bitcoin job first of all you
[08:50] have to um show that you can do that job
[08:54] like if you want to be a developer like
[08:56] it helps if you were developer before uh
[08:59] if you you want to be in in marketing it
[09:01] helps that you did marketing before but
[09:04] you can even uh do it yourself like uh I
[09:07] got so many connections just being
[09:09] active one year every day on bitcoin
[09:12] Twitter like I started on 103 with zero
[09:15] followers like not zero like 200
[09:17] followers or something like that and grw
[09:19] a following till 10,000 followers in the
[09:21] Bitcoin Community not by some grow hacks
[09:25] I just uh was engaging with everyone and
[09:27] was sending out five tweets per day and
[09:29] was uh building connections I was
[09:32] Skyping uh not Skyping I was zooming uh
[09:35] and Google meeting with with the people
[09:38] in the Bitcoin community and and just
[09:40] searched out for for Network searched
[09:43] out for for this connections with with
[09:45] bitcoiners which is amazing because a
[09:46] lot of talking with bitcoiners which
[09:49] then I kind of ended up talking as a
[09:51] profession to other bitcoiners uh and at
[09:55] some point uh I got a check from Twitter
[09:57] and I was so surprised that I can
[09:59] actually make money from that like I was
[10:00] not aiming to make money from that but
[10:03] then I was like oh okay Twitter sent me
[10:05] a check and I was like that's that's
[10:07] maybe enough to to buy me two days of
[10:09] food so like that's not a
[10:11] lot but but it it it gave me that little
[10:15] hope that I was like oh there there's
[10:17] money in social media then I took my
[10:19] YouTube more serious uh then I started
[10:22] the podcast to be really more serious
[10:25] and like after month um uh I actually
[10:27] got my first sponsor and then I was like
[10:30] okay I have a sponsor I have a small
[10:32] income it's not something it's not on
[10:34] the level that I was before but it it
[10:38] might be worth like I I had a full-time
[10:40] job next to it so I can do I make money
[10:43] from that even though I don't do it now
[10:47] full time I only do it like 10 hours a
[10:50] week or something like that what if I do
[10:52] it 50 60 hours a week like what what
[10:54] would the outcome then be so my way is
[10:57] for those people who actually want to
[10:59] build a business uh and and actually
[11:03] want to do something because you can
[11:04] build a business starting to build a
[11:06] business out even though you still have
[11:09] a fear job like you can start like five
[11:12] hours a week 10 hours a week maybe even
[11:14] 20 hours a week if you have a full-time
[11:15] job and you want to work 60 hours a week
[11:18] um then you can do it but show some
[11:21] proof of work like give give the reason
[11:23] that the the the company wants to hire
[11:26] you because you are a name in in Bitcoin
[11:30] or uh you have done some proof of work
[11:34] like for example if you want to be hired
[11:35] as a developer maybe just develop
[11:38] something in Bitcoin and then show those
[11:40] projects to the things like I think
[11:42] that's a that's a big thing uh for but
[11:47] I'm not an expert for getting a job just
[11:49] I just made my own job in Bitcoin yeah
[11:53] and but you mentioned a couple of really
[11:54] important thing one is um start safely
[11:58] while you are are still in a job and you
[12:00] have an income and just you know put
[12:02] your fers out try some see if they work
[12:05] or not and the other thing you mention
[12:07] is also I mean you chose to start a
[12:10] business but I think even finding a job
[12:13] as an employee it's a very
[12:17] entrepreneurial activity uh especially
[12:19] in especially in Bitcoin I think the the
[12:23] personality of a bitcoiner is a very
[12:26] entrepreneurial personality because
[12:28] Bitcoin
[12:30] or like entrepreneurs I mean it's very
[12:32] normal you start a business you put put
[12:33] in the work and you don't reap any
[12:36] rewards yet it takes time to build a
[12:39] business before you reap the rewards
[12:41] before you have customers before you
[12:43] have sponsors or before you make money
[12:46] and that is yeah that's not an employee
[12:49] mindset I think an employee mindset is
[12:51] like okay you get a job you go to work
[12:54] every day you get a you get a salary at
[12:57] the end of the month whether you did a
[12:58] good job or
[13:00] not that is not the bitcoiner mindset
[13:04] you know the bitcoiner mindset is the
[13:05] proof of work we first have to put in
[13:08] the work before we can reap the rewards
[13:10] you know block reward only is received
[13:14] after proof of work so that is the the
[13:17] the same thing uh the same approach that
[13:21] we have to take with finding work
[13:23] whether it's a job or a business clients
[13:26] or whatever so do you think that the
[13:30] social media presence even if you are
[13:33] aiming for a developer job or a
[13:35] non-marketing job is is something
[13:36] important as a proof of work that you
[13:38] are a bitcoiner and interacting with the
[13:40] Bitcoin
[13:41] Community your Bitcoin network is the
[13:45] other important ingredient next to proof
[13:47] of work so on one hand you have to show
[13:49] what you can do the on the other hand
[13:51] you have to build your Bitcoin Network
[13:53] made of humans in Bitcoin so and that
[13:57] depends um for you it was Twitter uh for
[14:01] a developer this might be somewhere else
[14:03] um maybe they hang out in a right now A
[14:06] Noster uh I would think uh or maybe I
[14:10] don't know GitHub very well I don't know
[14:13] if there are communities um or Discord
[14:16] or there are places where um your target
[14:20] group or your community will hang out
[14:23] you know or like I I also am a part of
[14:26] women's networks you know so maybe meet
[14:29] up in person or we have at every
[14:31] conference we have like a women's Branch
[14:33] or something or maybe there is like we
[14:35] have a telegram group so every person um
[14:39] no matter in what job or Niche you are
[14:41] you will find your your space on the
[14:44] Internet or you're um like I'm not very
[14:48] active on Twitter or I'm trying like
[14:51] yesterday was get on Noster day on
[14:53] Twitter everybody was posting their end
[14:56] poops I'm like oh I should take take
[14:59] this more seriously and hang out there
[15:00] more but social media has never really
[15:02] been my my thing it's a chore LinkedIn
[15:06] because I'm now in the world of careers
[15:08] and jobs uh makes more sense for me so I
[15:12] would just say Focus your energy and
[15:14] your efforts on the little pocket of the
[15:17] internet that makes sense to you but not
[15:20] everybody has to be on all the social
[15:23] media but you will find your people if
[15:25] you look for them you will find where
[15:27] they are another thing that I think a
[15:30] lot of people mistaken is like you don't
[15:34] have to be a developer to find a job um
[15:37] maybe to to give some context um what
[15:40] are the most common like chobs outside
[15:43] of being a developer because I feel like
[15:46] most people that want like oh I want to
[15:48] work in Bitcoin but I I don't want to
[15:50] code and I'm like yeah but what are you
[15:52] doing at your FIA job because bitco
[15:54] companies are also bit companies and
[15:56] they also need marketing they also need
[15:59] need recruitments they also need all the
[16:01] things that normal companies do need
[16:04] exactly um and I'm happy to say that we
[16:08] are now since we are scraping all of
[16:09] these jobs uh we are starting to put um
[16:13] reports together on all of uh this data
[16:16] because it's really important because
[16:18] everybody thinks oh I want to work in
[16:20] Bitcoin but I'm not a developer you
[16:22] don't have to be a developer but as I
[16:24] mentioned in the beginning during a bare
[16:27] Market I think
[16:29] most of the jobs are sort of developer
[16:32] related um but in a bull market that
[16:34] changes completely so let me just see
[16:38] what we have here because we put a
[16:40] little bit together so we have product
[16:43] managers nde roles product managers um
[16:47] sales development graphic
[16:50] designers uh marketing Bitcoin mining
[16:54] technicians so that I think is a very
[16:57] specialized um Mining facility job uh
[17:00] also a non- remote job because that's
[17:02] the other thing that half of the jobs in
[17:04] Bitcoin of course are remote uh
[17:07] accountants operations jobs sales and
[17:10] customer uh support of course and
[17:13] especially customer support I think is a
[17:15] great uh job to get in uh like Community
[17:19] manager customer support but these jobs
[17:21] I think we will see a lot more once the
[17:24] bull market really hit and that is also
[17:26] where my so my background is in customer
[17:28] service
[17:29] I have worked for uh for wallets uh and
[17:32] and like projects in the space and once
[17:35] the bull market hits and so many more
[17:38] people come into the space uh and they
[17:40] all have questions um customer support
[17:43] tickets like everywhere at exchanges at
[17:47] any service providers they just go up 10
[17:50] times in numbers and then they really
[17:53] need to hire um staff so I think we will
[17:56] see this anybody who is sub subcribe to
[17:59] the bit vocation feed I think this will
[18:02] Skyrocket uh in a few months in November
[18:04] dece or maybe like just after things go
[18:07] up um that will be very exciting so we
[18:10] have been really looking at the data
[18:12] since the beginning of the year and uh
[18:14] yeah once we have a whole year together
[18:17] it will be really exciting to see the
[18:19] the development into the bull market uh
[18:22] during the bull market and then as it
[18:23] goes down again yeah I think it would be
[18:26] a great uh second part to the podcast
[18:28] Maybe like in a year or 18 months to to
[18:31] see like a a job report how was the bull
[18:33] run because I feel like probably in the
[18:35] next like 12 to 18 months there will be
[18:37] a bull run no guarantees but if if
[18:40] history is any indication and all the
[18:42] things that we are now building up to
[18:44] that could be a major bull run the next
[18:46] 18 months so then uh it would be really
[18:49] interesting how the the the job market
[18:52] did in the last 18 months and then again
[18:55] like one two years later maybe then
[18:58] compared to to a bare market so it's
[19:00] really cool that you're collecting the
[19:02] data and you're collecting since 2024 or
[19:04] earlier already um well we have been
[19:07] scraping so I had the idea for bit
[19:10] vocation at the Bitcoin prag conference
[19:13] in
[19:14] 2023 uh because I met so many people who
[19:17] talk to me oh I want to work in Bitcoin
[19:19] but I'm not a developer or you know or I
[19:22] want to volunteer but I don't even know
[19:23] where to start or like everybody was
[19:25] like I how do I get my foot in the door
[19:29] um and I went to this conference
[19:32] specifically with the intention to
[19:34] figure out how I could serve the Bitcoin
[19:36] Community because before I was working
[19:38] with beginners and um yeah who were not
[19:41] part of the community who were Outsiders
[19:44] and um and I'm of course also working in
[19:47] this industry and but I also worked in
[19:50] the wider crypto space and I decided in
[19:54] 2023 I only want to work in Bitcoin I
[19:56] want to be just 100% Bitcoin only so I
[20:00] was also in the position of how do I
[20:02] find a job in this industry and yeah
[20:06] I've been very lucky so far in my career
[20:08] I never really had to look for jobs they
[20:12] maybe I knew how to network or my jobs
[20:14] always came from within my network and
[20:17] so for the first time I was like okay
[20:19] where where are the job boards where do
[20:21] you find this and I noticed looking for
[20:24] a job is a job in itself it's a lot of
[20:28] work
[20:29] and I thought why look I'm German uh
[20:32] efficiency is my middle name I always
[20:34] say so I was like there must be an
[20:36] easier way all these jobs they should
[20:38] come to me I shouldn't have to look for
[20:40] them and that's how I had the idea for
[20:42] like just
[20:44] scraping um the internet for just
[20:47] bitcoiner jobs and then putting them in
[20:49] a nice feed like on Telegram and that's
[20:52] how this uh how the bit vocation feed
[20:54] was born I did not do this I found
[20:57] someone um who could who could build
[21:00] this and yeah so then we started doing
[21:03] this at end of last year and then a few
[21:05] months in I was like we have a lot of
[21:08] data from scrap from scraping all of
[21:10] these jobs um and I haven't seen really
[21:15] like Bitcoin only job data out there
[21:19] it's always a bit mixed with crypto if
[21:21] it exists at all um so I thought let's
[21:24] just um yeah let's uh start doing that
[21:28] and then I also attracted some really
[21:31] smart people who joined my team and uh
[21:34] yeah that's really fun to work with them
[21:36] and and they have ideas and they come up
[21:37] with things so now I think from where
[21:40] are we now end of August so in September
[21:42] we are planning to start publishing uh
[21:46] the data that we have and of course it's
[21:48] not this is the first year so it's it
[21:52] will not be super super accurate because
[21:54] of course every month we add more
[21:56] companies to the scraper so it might
[21:58] look like there are more jobs but it's
[22:00] just because we are scraping more
[22:02] companies um but yeah it's it's a
[22:06] startup so every month we will do better
[22:09] and become more accurate yeah that that
[22:12] is really exciting to to be able to
[22:14] provide this also as another
[22:17] resource interesting uh yeah maybe uh
[22:21] how many jobs per company is uh is
[22:23] something that you can already uh
[22:26] provide um what what have you learned
[22:28] learn so far from from the data um so
[22:31] the most basic things is that it's not
[22:35] just Developer jobs it's actually even
[22:37] now that we're not in a bull market uh
[22:40] it's sort of
[22:41] 5050 which was really nice to see yeah
[22:44] 50% Developer jobs 50% non-de jobs uh
[22:49] also how many jobs are remote versus
[22:51] non- remote um so because Bitcoin is
[22:56] borderless and Global and the jobs
[22:58] should be the same ex except uh like
[23:01] mining facilities or something there are
[23:03] very few jobs that really require you to
[23:06] be on site on location there are a few
[23:09] companies um that um where I was
[23:12] surprised uh because Al I'm a digital
[23:15] Nomad I am used to working remotely but
[23:18] yeah there are still companies that
[23:19] prefer to have offices and have the team
[23:22] together which is also important but
[23:24] it's yeah I would say well it's
[23:27] definitely over 50% present remote jobs
[23:30] um but in some cases it's it's hard to
[23:33] tell for us from from scraping the data
[23:35] because there are also lots of hybrid
[23:37] jobs like especially in the US uh jobs
[23:40] are remote but you have to be within a
[23:43] certain time zone or in a certain state
[23:47] or something so I think in Europe This
[23:50] is a little bit different uh but yeah so
[23:53] there are for everybody to know there
[23:55] are many remote jobs and there are many
[23:57] non-de jobs so so this is really what I
[24:00] want people to know you don't have to be
[24:01] a developer
[24:04] also uh yeah and that is something I
[24:07] think important to know for people the
[24:09] Bitcoin space is still very small um and
[24:12] most of the companies are startups yeah
[24:15] many many companies are maybe just one
[24:18] person or two developers who had an idea
[24:21] and who started tinkering building
[24:24] something um my guess I don't really
[24:27] have
[24:29] uh really accurate data on this yet but
[24:32] I think maybe only 5% of the companies
[24:36] that exists are
[24:37] actually really active employers yeah
[24:41] who who hire a lot of like sworn Bitcoin
[24:45] or like profitable okay maybe also not
[24:47] the best example because they just
[24:50] fired I think half of their stuff but
[24:53] they according to our data we can really
[24:55] see it like like every month they had
[24:58] bit 15 and 25 new jobs and then in July
[25:02] August it just stopped um and there are
[25:06] also like the biggest employers are uh
[25:09] financial institutions and um like
[25:12] centralized exchanges like Kraken
[25:15] coinbase um bito and I'm often I'm
[25:19] thinking should I include them or not
[25:20] because of course they are not Bitcoin
[25:22] only companies on the other hand they
[25:25] are like really essential parts of the
[25:28] ecosystem so and since they have a lot
[25:31] of jobs and some people also just want
[25:34] to break into the industry I decided for
[25:37] now yeah we should include them but we
[25:39] will see going forward but also my first
[25:42] job in the industry was with the exodos
[25:44] wallet which is not a Bitcoin only
[25:47] wallet it's a multicurrency wallet but
[25:50] everybody gets paid in Bitcoin it's
[25:52] fully remote the owners are bitcoiners
[25:55] uh even though they serve The Wider uh
[25:57] crypto space
[25:59] uh to me it's a Bitcoin uh company so I
[26:02] want to include them also plus it's a
[26:05] great company to work for they have many
[26:07] jobs and I want to bring job Seekers you
[26:10] know vacancies or options to get their
[26:14] foot in the door in the space so uh yeah
[26:17] so there are some companies that we
[26:19] include that are not strictly Bitcoin
[26:22] only but they are really essential parts
[26:25] of the of the ecosystem do you have
[26:28] advice for people who
[26:30] have less skills and I'm thinking of
[26:34] people that maybe just come up from
[26:35] school or they like really want to start
[26:37] their career in in Bitcoin because I
[26:40] know a lot of big companies provide
[26:43] training programs and stuff like that
[26:45] but that will be probably not as common
[26:48] in in the Bitcoin scene as the companies
[26:50] are not as as as big and a startup
[26:53] cannot have the same training program
[26:56] when like to another compared to another
[26:59] company has like maybe 5,000 or 10,000
[27:01] employees already uh is is there
[27:03] something like that also in Bitcoin or
[27:05] is that less the case I think it's more
[27:10] about skills um like specific it's not
[27:14] so much about Job titles but specific
[27:17] skills and passion for Bitcoin so a
[27:21] passion for Bitcoin yeah well you either
[27:23] have it or you don't if you don't have
[27:24] it you you don't want to why would you
[27:26] want to work on bitcoin
[27:28] uh and skills I think there are so many
[27:31] courses uh I I have a friend who just
[27:34] messaged me like a week ago he
[27:35] completely fell into the rabbit hole
[27:37] he's teaching himself everything related
[27:40] to lightning Network right now he found
[27:43] the courses with NI D he's going to the
[27:46] Tokyo conference he's going to take a so
[27:48] there are uh tons of ways to to uh
[27:53] acquire knowledge um for free I think or
[27:56] also paid um but I I'm sure if even if
[28:00] you have no money you will find ways to
[28:03] learn everything you need to know about
[28:05] Bitcoin because also most content
[28:08] creators uh are so happy to share their
[28:10] knowledge you know as part of their
[28:12] proof of work and there's also so
[28:15] there's the plan B Network that is all
[28:17] about education then we have me me
[28:20] Premier Bitcoin then there is this I
[28:22] think it's called Summer of Bitcoin in
[28:25] Switzerland which is actually targeting
[28:27] students
[28:28] uh I believe which is sort of it's not
[28:31] an internship but
[28:33] it's I think it's um like a summer camp
[28:37] or something where students who come
[28:38] from University or who are still
[28:41] studying really learn everything about
[28:43] Bitcoin so there are many initiatives if
[28:47] if people just look for them they can
[28:49] find them I have seen also intern
[28:53] positions at some companies um but I
[28:56] think anyone can just acquire if if they
[29:00] know what they want they will find a way
[29:02] to acquire the skills um especially if
[29:05] it's like technical skills online uh or
[29:08] there are hackathons or you know there
[29:10] are tons of ways especially for
[29:12] technical people for the other people
[29:15] like I had a like for example also me at
[29:17] bit vocation I'm offering uh people to
[29:21] just use their skills and gain their
[29:23] proof of work in my team in bit vocation
[29:27] because I noticed that um while there
[29:30] are many open-source projects where
[29:33] technical people like developers can
[29:34] just contribute uh their their code
[29:37] their skills I don't see uh many
[29:41] opportunities for non technical people
[29:44] so I was like okay I cannot build bit
[29:46] vocation alone and I would like to build
[29:49] bit vocation according to the same
[29:51] principles as Bitcoin itself now it's
[29:55] not going to be decentralized because
[29:57] it's my baby and I still want to be in
[29:59] charge of it um but I would like to um
[30:05] just distribute the ownership of the
[30:08] tasks as much as
[30:11] possible um so yeah if there's anybody
[30:14] who has any skills that they want to use
[30:16] in a Bitcoin company um contact me like
[30:20] I had a video editor who I already lost
[30:23] because he actually found a job I have a
[30:25] data guy right now he's amazing I have a
[30:27] business develop who's amazing I have a
[30:30] web developer help uh and my scraper
[30:33] telegram it's I have an amazing team and
[30:36] I'm happy to add more people based on
[30:40] like social media you and I just talked
[30:42] about it I don't like social media if
[30:44] there's anybody who would love to show
[30:46] their social media skills uh in a
[30:49] Bitcoin company and and put their first
[30:52] proof of work in Bitcoin on their CV or
[30:54] on
[30:55] LinkedIn contact me um if anybody has
[30:59] any ideas of skills that they want to
[31:01] show in the Bitcoin company um I'm happy
[31:04] to add more people to my team uh
[31:07] temporarily uh just it should be a
[31:09] win-win so you lend me your skills for a
[31:12] couple of weeks or months and then
[31:15] hopefully I can help you find a job
[31:17] create a win-win through that if you
[31:19] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:21] regular basis I guess you already bought
[31:23] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[31:26] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[31:29] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:32] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:34] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:36] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[31:38] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[31:41] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[31:47] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[31:51] your bitbox and if you really want to
[31:54] bulletproof your self custody setup your
[31:56] security setup and maybe even your
[31:59] citizenship set up you have to talk to

[32:21] digital footprint in general is secure
[32:24] they are the experts in cyber security
[32:27] and Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[32:30] secure sovereign individual in general
[32:34] and last but not least I have something
[32:36] completely new for you guys I partnered
[32:39] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[32:43] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:46] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:48] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:51] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[32:54] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:57] there here and show that you are a
[32:59] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[33:02] Bitcoin only make sure to check out the
[33:05] link in the description for this amazing
[33:07] coin vigilante time pieces those watches
[33:10] are amazing I love them so much it was
[33:12] really hard for me to pick the one that
[33:14] I want to have because there are a lot
[33:16] of great options I went with the new
[33:19] transparency Edition they're all limited
[33:22] so grab yours those will not be
[33:24] available for a long time but there will
[33:26] come new models and new amazing designs
[33:29] along the way it's an interesting
[33:31] onboarding intership internship program
[33:34] that you offer it's an interesting
[33:36] concept because like yeah I don't want
[33:39] to call it an internship because uh I'm
[33:43] I'm not here to teach people skills um I
[33:46] want to give people the opportunity to
[33:49] to use their existing skills and get a
[33:52] testimonial and and and get me and all
[33:55] our team to experience their skills and
[33:58] how great they are because then this way
[34:00] I know it because I have connections I
[34:02] have found tons of people jobs before
[34:05] and also they build their Bitcoin
[34:07] Network through the people who are
[34:08] already in bit vocation who will all
[34:10] move on hopefully to bitcoin companies
[34:13] so it's another way to build your proof
[34:15] of work and your Bitcoin Network at the
[34:17] same time laugh it really really cool um
[34:20] as also the interesting topic because
[34:23] sometimes I get it's like oh
[34:24] decentralize your podcast and I do my
[34:27] best
[34:28] uh to make the podcast more
[34:31] decentralized but of course it's it's
[34:33] just me so I cannot be really
[34:35] decentralized but two things I do is
[34:38] first off all my content is free to take
[34:41] like if anyone wants to take my Clips
[34:44] they can use it for advertisement they
[34:46] can commercially use it they can use it
[34:48] for films and documenters I don't care
[34:50] they don't have to credit me they don't
[34:51] have to pay me they don't have to do
[34:53] anything for that if they credit me I'm
[34:56] really grateful if they pay me I'm
[34:57] really grateful but it's just an
[34:59] optional thing uh so that way I I that's
[35:03] kind of the the satosi spirit you you do
[35:06] something without taking something from
[35:08] it because I get paid for my sponsors I
[35:10] get paid from YouTube I get paid from X
[35:12] so like I already get paid for doing
[35:15] that and if someone just wants to take
[35:17] the podcast out Clips out whatever out
[35:20] uh they are they free to do that like I
[35:22] I will not uh punish anyone uh for doing
[35:25] that in in actually in the opposite I
[35:27] think it's advertisement even for my
[35:29] podcast if someone takes it out and and
[35:31] posts it on social media even if they
[35:32] don't credit me uh so I never understood
[35:35] that whole oh you you should credit the
[35:38] original no just put it out there at
[35:40] least for me yeah people might do it
[35:43] anyway and it's so much hassle to go
[35:45] after them if you wanted to so just
[35:47] allow them to do it uh it's yeah it's a
[35:50] better energy this way exactly and it's
[35:53] so interesting because uh sometimes like
[35:55] you YouTube has a feature where you can
[35:57] see who stole your content and then I
[36:03] once in a week or once in a month I look
[36:05] in there and like oh cool there's a
[36:07] account who use like 100% of the video
[36:10] or 50% of the video or 70% of the video
[36:12] yeah like YouTube has really nice
[36:13] statistics to that and just go in there
[36:16] and comment there hey thank you for for
[36:18] uh um taking my podcast I'm I'm really
[36:22] gr gr grateful that you you liked it so
[36:26] I'm I'm really like oh and then
[36:29] sometimes I get this messages oh I was
[36:31] like surprised that you messaged me like
[36:33] and that you liked it that that I used
[36:35] and I'm like yeah of course that's the
[36:36] that's the spirit of satosi and the
[36:38] other thing that I I wanted to mention
[36:41] is like I try to give everyone a stage I
[36:45] noticed that Bitcoin podcast themes
[36:47] especially the bigger ones have like the
[36:48] the same I don't know 50 people all over
[36:51] again like it's like a washing machine
[36:53] and they they're washing their guest uh
[36:56] every half year or year here and I am
[36:59] now like eight nine months in a podcast
[37:02] game and uh I have over 220 different
[37:07] guests already uh and I want to have uh
[37:11] this year over 300 different guests on
[37:14] and if you calculate that out over five
[37:16] years uh this will be 1,500 guests and I
[37:19] really want to get on this trajectory
[37:21] where I have a lot of different Minds in
[37:24] Bitcoin then it will be also like maybe
[37:27] Broad maybe just people in Freedom and
[37:29] and building stuff also but as as long
[37:32] as it gets Bitcoin only um so this is my
[37:36] two two cents for for for being a
[37:39] decentralized podcast with giving not
[37:41] only the big names a stage but also the
[37:44] smaller ones and opening up uh the I
[37:48] don't know how it's called like
[37:49] copyright things like like just take it
[37:51] wherever you want to take it uh and I'm
[37:54] happy to even assist you like if you
[37:56] want uh podcast without the logo like
[37:58] just hit me up and I will send you the
[38:00] raw files like no no worries about that
[38:03] and I'm here looking really forward to
[38:05] to what I can do with that but I just
[38:06] wanted to throw throw that in as as you
[38:08] mentioned theal company yeah and it's
[38:11] really important because that's also
[38:12] something I noticed that it's always
[38:14] this I mean we all have our gurus in the
[38:17] space that we love to hear and uh it's
[38:20] nice if they keep reappearing on
[38:22] different podcasts but for regular
[38:25] people to get into Bitcoin they need to
[38:28] see other regular people you know from
[38:31] not always the same celebrities uh and
[38:34] especially I mean there are different
[38:36] niches where this is the case but one
[38:38] Niche is also women in Bitcoin so as
[38:41] women in bit so when I checked your
[38:43] podcast I was like okay has he had any
[38:45] women and yes you have there are others
[38:49] who have not and
[38:51] especially uh like women we need to see
[38:54] other women uh to think oh okay if
[38:57] there's a maybe that's for me if if if
[38:59] this woman gets Bitcoin maybe I can get
[39:02] Bitcoin because most women think they
[39:04] will not understand uh Bitcoin and the
[39:07] same thing also in in jobs like women
[39:10] will only apply to any company whether
[39:14] it's a Bitcoin company or not if they
[39:16] see other women in the team so that is
[39:18] also something that uh I think companies
[39:22] companies are not aware of and
[39:24] especially in the tech space which is
[39:26] still male do
[39:27] or whatever the word
[39:29] is um and yeah women will always check
[39:33] the team page before they uh apply for a
[39:36] job to see do I fit in are these my
[39:39] people or is this just a bunch of men
[39:42] you know so it's also really important
[39:44] because I know many uh teams many
[39:46] employers they want to have more women
[39:48] on the team um but it means they also
[39:51] need to show uh more women so that's
[39:53] also maybe on the website even if it's
[39:56] just a ey picture in the beginning not
[39:58] for the team we should not fake team
[40:00] members but just any um uh pictures on
[40:04] the website uh it's if the company is
[40:07] completely made up of men they may not
[40:09] think about this yeah how they are if
[40:12] they are actually attracting women to
[40:14] even apply for
[40:16] jobs I just uh quickly scroll through my
[40:19] content I had uh already 20 women on
[40:22] yeah just like quickly uh um um counted
[40:26] uh yeah never never did it I I maybe um
[40:30] I I will do more more playlists uh uh on
[40:34] on my channel I don't have right now
[40:37] playlists on my channel but I I want to
[40:38] do more playlists uh and one playlist
[40:41] could be like women in Bitcoin that
[40:43] would be a very easy one just like find
[40:45] all the women that have been on my
[40:46] podcast and it's really interesting for
[40:48] me because um I started to invite more
[40:51] more women uh and I'm searching for them
[40:55] like we we had this I think e you you
[40:58] you heard the the the podcast e and I
[41:00] don't know if you heard the whole thing
[41:01] because in the end we talked about also
[41:03] women in podcasting and women around
[41:06] that and we we talked about that uh
[41:09] effect of like she had the same thing
[41:11] when she had saor on and I had sa on a
[41:14] lot of male uh people were in my DMs and
[41:18] in her DMS hey can I also be on the
[41:20] podcast there was not one woman uh woman
[41:24] asking for that like all the M like oh m
[41:27] s was on I I I also want to be on so
[41:30] this this uh effect is is definitely
[41:32] there and also I get the most rejections
[41:35] for podcast interviews from females I
[41:37] don't get a lot of rejections at all
[41:39] like probably like I don't know 2% of of
[41:42] of the people that I write hey do you
[41:44] want to be on the podcast uh don't write
[41:47] me at all or say no like there's a very
[41:50] small amount of people but I have um
[41:53] especially with with women that haven't
[41:55] been on many podcasts maybe just on one
[41:57] or maybe haven't been on any podcast uh
[42:00] and with mail it's different like I I
[42:02] write them they're like yeah yeah let's
[42:03] do it even they have never been on a
[42:06] podcast but they have this like oh yeah
[42:07] let's let's do it anyways but with EOD
[42:10] if you haven't watched it like it's
[42:12] really interesting I think the last like
[42:13] 20 30 minutes or something like
[42:16] that like I mentioned it was a very
[42:19] heavy subject in the beginning so I
[42:21] needed to take it a little bit easy but
[42:23] I want to finish it yeah um do do you
[42:26] see
[42:28] do do you see the similar patterns in in
[42:30] the job
[42:31] market sorry I just want to quickly ask
[42:35] do do these women give you a reason why
[42:37] they are not why they don't want to come
[42:39] on the podcast or is yeah it's it's
[42:42] usually it's usually the same uh reason
[42:45] uh I I sometimes hear it also from men
[42:47] but very very uh not a lot like why me
[42:51] like I'm not interesting like um like I
[42:55] don't have a specialized opinion I I'm
[42:58] not technical Savvy in Bitcoin and like
[43:02] uh it's it's it's like I have to
[43:05] convince them that I found them
[43:07] interesting that's why I write
[43:09] them but I have this sometimes also with
[43:12] men but very very very uncommon with
[43:15] with men so that's it's an interesting
[43:17] and and that's why I was curious if if
[43:19] you see the same pattern with with chop
[43:22] Appliance yes so two things first of all
[43:25] that's the answer I expected um because
[43:28] women are a lot less confident
[43:32] in yeah I think in a male Tech
[43:34] environment or maybe in general like I
[43:37] am saying this because I was the same I
[43:39] was always like what do I have who would
[43:41] want to listen to me and what do I have
[43:43] to say whatever I'm not an expert uh I'm
[43:47] definitely not an expert on bitcoin you
[43:49] know
[43:50] but I just so two things first of all I
[43:53] love talking with bitcoiners about
[43:55] Bitcoin that's what we all want so we
[43:57] already have a good basis for
[43:59] conversation on any Bitcoin podcast um
[44:03] and secondly yeah um since I have uh
[44:07] worked with so many women also educated
[44:10] them about Bitcoin onboarded them to
[44:12] bitcoin um I know that their fears and
[44:17] their doubts and and the lack of
[44:20] confidence when it comes to money when
[44:21] it comes to Tech uh when it comes to
[44:24] being seen going on stage or talking on
[44:27] a podcast talking on a stage I just
[44:29] spoke in June at my very first
[44:32] conference yeah I've been in Bitcoin for
[44:34] 8 years or something and so men I mean I
[44:39] don't like to generalize men are like
[44:41] this women are we don't
[44:43] know in the general experience men are
[44:46] just more confident and they they maybe
[44:49] think of themselves quicker as experts
[44:52] than women and unless women really are
[44:56] 150% Ure that they really know every
[44:58] single detail about the subject uh they
[45:01] will not speak up or or be seen or
[45:03] whatever I do think or I I do know based
[45:07] on studies that this is also uh relevant
[45:10] in the job market uh a woman will um uh
[45:14] apply to a job if she thinks that she
[45:18] knows every single requirement that she
[45:21] can fulfill this and men if they know
[45:24] 60% or some I don't know the exact
[45:26] numbers but uh men just see this
[45:29] differently and so there is a relation
[45:32] but yeah especially in Bitcoin with the
[45:35] women in Bitcoin one reason why I'm
[45:38] appearing on more podcasts yeah one
[45:40] reason is I need to promote bit vocation
[45:43] of course but the other one is I want to
[45:46] be seen by women I want to get more
[45:49] women into the space I don't want them
[45:51] to miss out on this on the biggest
[45:54] Financial revolution of Our Lives I
[45:56] don't want them to yeah be left behind I
[45:59] don't want them to end up in slavery I
[46:03] want them to have to understand savings
[46:06] technology um and they will only be
[46:08] motivated to do this well one if they
[46:11] have a problem that Bitcoin can solve
[46:15] but two if they see other people like
[46:18] them which is women in this case so we
[46:21] all need to see other people who are
[46:23] like us publicly uh so that we can think
[46:27] oh if if they understand it or if they
[46:30] believe in it then maybe it's something
[46:31] for me too so yeah one the main reason
[46:35] for me to be more public is for all the
[46:37] other women out there so that they can
[46:40] see more women uh online speaking about
[46:42] Bitcoin or working in Bitcoin yeah and I
[46:45] noticed that actually because uh I in
[46:49] the studing I think like the first like
[46:51] 20 30 episodes was like no women um
[46:54] because like I just wrote random people
[46:56] and
[46:57] who comes on a on on a in a non-existing
[46:59] podcast but then slowly it started and I
[47:02] think the the frequency is is a little
[47:04] better now uh and I started out with
[47:06] like three four five% of women and now
[47:09] I'm approaching like 10 and 11% I know
[47:13] that Natalie prunell which is I think
[47:16] the biggest female podcaster in the
[47:18] scene um yeah she she probably is but a
[47:22] wide a wide margin even um and she
[47:25] posted I think a few months AG go that
[47:27] she has 20% female audience so even a a
[47:30] female host of a Bitcoin podcast only
[47:33] has 20% so that's like kind of my
[47:36] Benchmark like if I can get to 20% I'm
[47:38] really doing good if a female host can
[47:40] get there uh then then a male host that
[47:43] would be amazing but I'm pretty
[47:45] satisfied now with my 10% half of the
[47:48] ones that has a I mean if the women are
[47:51] also just not there where are you going
[47:53] to find them so but it's it's good uh
[47:56] that you're reaching out and that you're
[47:58] inviting them because yeah that is
[48:00] another thing is actually something I
[48:03] experienced women and men are just
[48:05] different uh at that conference that I
[48:08] was speaking there was also a podcaster
[48:10] or YouTuber um who like he for the whole
[48:14] weekend he was interviewing one person
[48:17] after the other of the other
[48:19] speakers and and there were two women
[48:22] myself and another woman and we were the
[48:25] only two who were not interviewed so I
[48:28] was like how and I spoke to one of the
[48:31] other guys I was like how how does this
[48:34] work how does he select his his um
[48:37] interview girl and he said I don't know
[48:39] I just went and said let's have a
[48:42] chat and and I went to The Other Woman
[48:45] did you get invited to an interview no I
[48:47] didn't get in so we were waiting to be
[48:50] invited and and we thought oh this guy
[48:53] only speaks to men I also checked his
[48:55] YouTube channel he only speaks to men uh
[48:58] maybe not on purpose maybe there's just
[49:00] a Comm communication a misunderstanding
[49:04] so yeah note to self invite myself talk
[49:09] to people uh all and all the other women
[49:12] we just yeah and and also note to all
[49:14] the men or male
[49:16] podcasters invite the women you know or
[49:19] if you're interested in in certain women
[49:22] speakers I mean I'm also not like oh you
[49:25] know people should be invited just
[49:26] because they are women no they should
[49:28] also be interesting guests or have
[49:31] something to share but yeah there seems
[49:33] to be a
[49:35] mismatch there's some other interesting
[49:37] statistic that I can share from my
[49:39] podcast um I I think
[49:42] around I invite around like 60 70% of my
[49:46] guests uh and the rest is either coming
[49:49] from themselves they like hey I want to
[49:51] be interviewed or they are coming
[49:53] through another guest like another guest
[49:55] is actually more Comon these days like a
[49:57] guest is saying like hey Robin you
[49:59] should also have him on or hey Robin he
[50:02] would be a great fit um and
[50:05] interestingly enough all the women that
[50:08] were on my podcast I invited there was
[50:11] not one woman showing up and saying like
[50:13] hey I want to be on your podcast yeah
[50:15] but on the other side males like even
[50:17] with big followings like even way bigger
[50:19] names than me that are on stage on
[50:21] bitcoin Brock on stage on Nashville they
[50:23] are coming to me and saying like hey I
[50:25] have this new book I want to be speaking
[50:27] on your podcast on this on this book
[50:30] like uh which I really love because it
[50:32] shows that they have like absolutely um
[50:35] like they are willing to go on on
[50:38] podcasts that are smaller like this was
[50:40] uh and then they they're like oh no I'm
[50:42] this big one I should be invited and
[50:44] stuff like that they write me themselves
[50:45] so this is really cool but I I I just
[50:48] saw that till now not one woman wrote me
[50:51] like hey I want to be on your podcast
[50:53] yeah and I just noticed that last time
[50:55] when I spoke with like I and was never
[50:58] aware of that fact actually uh so it's
[51:01] it's interesting for me that like me men
[51:03] like oh I want to be on the in the
[51:05] podcast and more the more the hunters
[51:08] and less of like oh like I I should be
[51:10] invited at
[51:11] least yeah very interesting so that's
[51:15] also an invitation for me to just reach
[51:17] out to more podcasters yeah
[51:20] definitely yeah if if you want to be on
[51:23] podcast like I I can only speak for
[51:25] myself I don't know how the other hosts
[51:26] are doing it I I should check out with
[51:30] them if they have some tips for me also
[51:32] but I um evaluate everyone the same way
[51:36] I'm like okay is is is there some
[51:38] interesting topic for me like also for
[51:41] you um um I forgot his name someone uh
[51:45] brought you up and said like hey you
[51:47] should be on yeah exactly and he said
[51:50] like hey you should have her on uh and I
[51:53] was like oh I will check her out and
[51:54] like 5 minutes later I I wrote you and
[51:57] he was like oh you're you're fast
[51:59] and I'm like yeah if I see a profile and
[52:00] I see a topic like I have to make a
[52:02] podcast interesting if there's nothing
[52:05] then it's really hard for me to invite
[52:06] invite someone but I saw some an
[52:09] interesting profile I saw an interesting
[52:10] person I was like let's invite her that
[52:13] that's like a decision I make in like
[52:14] one minute and it doesn't matter if a
[52:16] guest brings it up I see you in the feet
[52:18] or you ride me myself so like I make no
[52:21] uh difference here and so like if if
[52:23] someone writes me and they're
[52:25] interesting like w maybe also an
[52:27] invitation to every one of my viewers if
[52:30] they they think they have an interesting
[52:31] story and they want to share something
[52:33] on the podcast like just reach out like
[52:36] uh I I respond to everyone uh and the
[52:38] worst thing that can happen that you
[52:40] will not be on the podcast and if you
[52:41] don't ask guess what you will also not
[52:43] be on the
[52:46] podcast that's learning also now the
[52:49] good thing about women is we are all we
[52:52] have a tight Network and especially in
[52:55] Bitcoin it's such a supportive community
[52:58] of women I mean everybody is supportive
[53:01] also the men I think Bitcoin is just
[53:04] amazing uh a supportive Community but
[53:06] after our podcast I will reach out to
[53:09] all the interesting Bitcoin women I know
[53:12] and tell them about this first of all
[53:14] that they can contact you um but any
[53:17] podcaster that they should should
[53:20] more courageous and say hey interview me
[53:24] I have something interesting to talk
[53:26] about about um but especially yours yeah
[53:29] since I know now that you are interested
[53:31] so absolutely yeah please do that um one
[53:36] thing that back to the to the Bitcoin
[53:39] chob Market topic um you said like if if
[53:43] you're not passionate about Bitcoin why
[53:45] should you work in Bitcoin which which
[53:47] brought the the uh thought in my head
[53:50] like there there might be some negative
[53:52] things in in working for Bitcoin you
[53:55] mentioned already two two things where
[53:57] like the link to the price and the job
[53:59] security um what challenges or what what
[54:02] negative sides are there to do working
[54:05] in Bitcoin obviously if you're are
[54:06] passionate about Bitcoin they probably
[54:08] don't matter but uh is there something
[54:11] that you're like oh you should be aware
[54:12] of that before you actually enter a a
[54:16] Bitcoin job well the one thing I
[54:17] mentioned is the job security that's
[54:20] just not there yet we we've just seen
[54:22] even big uh established companies like
[54:26] uh sworn just let go half of their
[54:29] staff uh so there's always something
[54:31] that can happen because it's just a very
[54:34] new and volatile
[54:35] industry I think to me that would be the
[54:38] only thing but there's also
[54:41] still fears that you might become a
[54:44] Target I noticed and I have to admit
[54:48] that this is completely not on my mind
[54:50] anymore um many of us we will die on
[54:54] this hill I have adopted this
[54:57] few years ago this mindset but I
[55:00] actually noticed because we have a
[55:02] Bitcoin walk here so it's not about
[55:04] working in Bitcoin but you know the
[55:06] Bitcoin works that um Jacob started we
[55:09] have one here in Bulgaria in banso where
[55:11] I spent a lot of time and uh we have
[55:14] quite a big group now but I there is one
[55:17] bitcoiner that I know lives here and she
[55:19] was like why would I join this this walk
[55:23] and make myself a Target you know like
[55:26] if if people know that I'm me I don't
[55:27] want people to know that I'm in Bitcoin
[55:30] and yeah I was surprised that some
[55:32] people still think like this um but
[55:35] maybe it also depends where you I mean
[55:38] in Bulgaria yeah nobody cares but maybe
[55:41] there are areas or or like countries in
[55:44] the world where it's just yeah where
[55:46] it's dangerous where you shouldn't um be
[55:49] public about um being a bitcoiner or
[55:52] working in Bitcoin but I think those are
[55:54] very few
[55:56] now so personally yeah I'm not uh
[55:59] worried about anything like that so the
[56:01] only risk really is that you uh might
[56:04] suddenly lose your job um when when the
[56:07] team runs out of money and that's just
[56:09] something you need to be prepared for
[56:11] but if you're a good bitcoiner with a
[56:13] long time Horizon and you manage your
[56:15] Bitcoin well then you can take care of
[56:18] your own security very true very
[56:20] beautiful um and what is the the the
[56:23] positive side of it like how different
[56:25] is is is a Bitcoin job to to to a fe job
[56:29] in in general is there like a different
[56:32] vibe or or is it just uh depending on
[56:36] who's employing you like it's probably
[56:38] like a job at Kraken or something like
[56:40] that will be maybe even kind of the same
[56:43] or how do you see it um I think
[56:47] companies like kaken are really they
[56:49] they run in a very similar way to
[56:51] corporate uh Fiat companies because they
[56:54] are actually Fiat companies
[56:57] they have to uh submit to the same like
[57:00] compliance and legal uh stuff as any
[57:02] other company but I think yeah 95% of uh
[57:06] companies in Bitcoin are startups uh are
[57:10] just very small companies that are that
[57:14] have been started by bitcoiners by yeah
[57:18] like I said often maybe it's just a
[57:20] couple of developers who had an idea and
[57:22] then of course they started growing
[57:24] bitcoiners want to work with other
[57:26] bitcoiners so I think it's um very
[57:30] Community Based Bitcoin companies also
[57:33] hire from within their Community I don't
[57:36] know if you are in any of that's
[57:38] actually a little Insider tip that I can
[57:40] give to people looking for jobs every
[57:44] startup has um a Discord or a beta
[57:48] tester group a telegram or something
[57:51] where they hang out with their very
[57:53] first users like in my case for example
[57:55] was the fountain app the fountain
[57:57] podcast app I'm sure you know it um they
[58:00] were three people when they first
[58:02] started um and uh of course they want to
[58:06] be in touch with their users yeah so
[58:09] they had a little bit a little beta
[58:12] tester group I think we were 30 people
[58:14] at the beginning um and that already
[58:18] feels like being part of the project
[58:21] being part of the company yeah and then
[58:24] when they do uh grow and when they do
[58:28] hire people where will they look for
[58:30] them of course in their closest
[58:33] Community which is their beta tester
[58:35] group or like also relay they have the
[58:38] squad the relay Squad um which is
[58:41] ambassadors which is I guess also better
[58:44] beta tester a little bit so every so I
[58:46] would recommend everybody to find a
[58:49] project that they really love like for
[58:51] me it was the fountain app like two or
[58:53] three years ago and just
[58:56] join them um because that will already
[58:59] feel
[59:01] like well not like working in Bitcoin
[59:03] but like like contributing and being
[59:06] part of something and uh you basically
[59:09] you get to hang out with the CEO of a
[59:11] company in which other industry can you
[59:13] do that so I was hanging out with Oscar
[59:17] and Nick back then from the fountain app
[59:19] in this group and then at some point
[59:20] they were looking for help with customer
[59:23] support I raised my hand and that's how
[59:25] I I got the job I worked for them for
[59:28] for less than a year but set up customer
[59:31] support and everything so this is what
[59:34] it's like to work in Bitcoin you it's
[59:37] like con concentric circles is that the
[59:40] word I hope I'm not saying this wrong
[59:42] but you start on the outside and you get
[59:45] closer and closer into the community
[59:47] until you end up working in a Bitcoin
[59:50] community so yeah that's my biggest tip
[59:53] uh find a project that you love join
[59:56] their Inner Circle their beta tester
[59:58] group start helping start
[60:00] contributing um and uh yeah and network
[60:05] in in these communities and uh you might
[60:07] end up with a job sooner or
[60:10] later well you mentioned also before
[60:12] that Comm Bitcoin Community is such a
[60:14] supportive one and and I 100% attest to
[60:17] that like it's it's really cool how how
[60:20] supportive they are um why why do you
[60:23] think Bitcoin Community is such a strong
[60:26] one why the the why is the the
[60:27] commitment to each other helping each
[60:29] other s such a big one well I think we
[60:32] are all United by um the desire to make
[60:37] Bitcoin
[60:38] successful you know um whatever our
[60:41] reasons are like my initial reason to to
[60:44] get into Bitcoin was to uh fix my my
[60:49] future my pension plan in the future
[60:52] because I noticed that all the things
[60:54] that I had put in place at as a
[60:56] responsible German were just not working
[60:59] and I will not have a pension even the
[61:01] one that I paid involuntarily whatever
[61:04] so that is how I noticed I have to
[61:07] become an investor and then I heard
[61:09] about Bitcoin I was like oh Bitcoin is
[61:11] the fastest vehicle for me to to get
[61:14] there so that was my initial uh reason
[61:18] to study it but then I learned about all
[61:21] the the freedom the decentralization the
[61:23] self- sovereignty like the transparency
[61:25] the priv pracy like all the things the
[61:27] human rights the the things all the
[61:30] things that Bitcoin uh can fix and help
[61:33] contribute so I my highest value in life
[61:36] is freedom and truth and those are the
[61:39] like the two things that are found in
[61:41] Bitcoin so this is why I want Bitcoin to
[61:44] succeed and yeah to take care of me when
[61:47] I'm old uh
[61:49] financially but everybody might have
[61:52] depending on where they live depending
[61:54] on their life circumstances they might
[61:56] have different reasons why Bitcoin is
[61:58] important to them but what unites us all
[62:01] is that we want Bitcoin to succeed
[62:03] because we understand it's the only way
[62:06] for us to stay free in a digital world
[62:09] it's either I always say it's either
[62:11] savings technology or slaving technology
[62:15] or I don't know if that's a proper
[62:17] English word or enslaving technology but
[62:20] we are at this Crossroad right now where
[62:23] we have to pick a s side and and all the
[62:25] people who pick Bitcoin we all have a
[62:28] common goal and I think that's why well
[62:31] it's also exciting to be at the
[62:32] Forefront of such a new technology and
[62:35] and have to have such a big vision for
[62:38] for fixing the world is is the the
[62:41] decision that you also talking about
[62:42] like between slavery and Bitcoin kind of
[62:45] like the the the Bitcoin route and maybe
[62:48] the cbdc route that we might go through
[62:51] do you see that also like maybe it's
[62:53] even a riskk to to bitcoin with cbdcs I
[62:56] don't know if it's a risk to bitcoin but
[62:57] it's a risk to humanity I mean cbdcs to
[63:01] me is the biggest threat
[63:03] to humanity right now ex apart from war
[63:07] and all the other bad things uh
[63:11] but it is the biggest threat to to
[63:14] personal
[63:15] freedom like I cannot when I think about
[63:18] cbdcs honestly I yeah if I weren't
[63:21] already in
[63:23] Bitcoin uh I want to invest all my
[63:26] energy in Bitcoin in having an
[63:29] alternative that keeps Humanity free in
[63:33] a digital world and the world is digital
[63:35] it will become more and more digital and
[63:38] I just don't see any other alternative
[63:40] except for Bitcoin right now so that's
[63:42] what I'm putting my energy in I actually
[63:45] see even cbdcs as an advertisement for
[63:49] for Bitcoin long term like if really
[63:51] governments really push that uh they are
[63:54] pushing basic basically digital
[63:56] wallets uh and and having only digital
[63:59] money and then I think citizens will be
[64:03] like oh there's like this digital Euro
[64:05] this digital uh US dollar um and then
[64:09] there's this digital Bitcoin thing so
[64:12] they're warming the the society up to
[64:14] digital money and then the chump to
[64:16] bitcoin is like oh yeah like your
[64:19] digital Euro I cannot spend on on
[64:22] weekends or I can only spend to this
[64:25] amount and there's limits to it oh yeah
[64:28] the I heard my my uncle there got his
[64:31] account Frozen because there was some
[64:34] some weird thing this all doesn't happen
[64:37] with Bitcoin and I think it could act
[64:40] like cbdcs could be a trojan horse for
[64:44] Bitcoin and that's that's an interesting
[64:46] thought that that I had with like bit
[64:48] Bitcoin could actually benefit a lot of
[64:50] governments pushing cbdc yeah
[64:54] um I
[64:56] I agree and I also have similar hopes
[64:59] because I'm like who is building these
[65:02] cbdcs they are smart people and I My
[65:06] Hope Is that these people build back
[65:09] doors or something like these people are
[65:14] bitcoiners that um make it look on the
[65:18] outside like they're building whatever
[65:21] the government wants but in the But
[65:23] ultimately they built what human ity
[65:26] needs yeah and so I'm also a very
[65:30] spiritual person I uh listen to a lot of
[65:34] spiritual teachers and astrologers
[65:36] whatever I don't base my investment
[65:38] decisions on it but um I have hope for
[65:42] Humanity uh from what I'm
[65:45] hearing this will not happen uh people
[65:49] are waking up more and more and yes it
[65:51] might be very convenient and and uh that
[65:55] this is how how they always get us with
[65:57] convenience you know oh you don't need
[65:59] to use dirty cash anymore and this is
[66:02] much faster whatever but people will
[66:05] wake up um plus it's the opposite of
[66:08] progress uh it's a deterioration of
[66:11] money because it will be cbdcs will is
[66:15] not be is not fungible money you know a
[66:17] dollar or Euro will not be a Euro
[66:20] anymore if each Euro has a different
[66:22] expiry date or you cannot if cannot like
[66:26] you said spend this Euro on the weekends
[66:29] or or for this course or this is only
[66:32] valid for three months and this one is
[66:33] valid for 20 years or what this is like
[66:36] the opposite of of what money should be
[66:39] so it's like a regression um while
[66:42] Bitcoin has all the all the uh
[66:46] characteristics of sound money so yeah I
[66:49] don't think Humanity will go in a
[66:51] Direction Where in the opposite of
[66:53] progress I just can't imagine that but
[66:57] let's see I I hope so too I'm very
[66:59] hopeful for the future and I just hope
[67:02] that uh people can see through that what
[67:04] cbdcs really are and see through that
[67:07] what Bitcoin really is and then decide
[67:10] uh the the the best they can and yeah
[67:13] I'm I'm really hopeful person in general
[67:15] really positive all so I'm I'm I'm
[67:17] thinking of like cbdcs might be uh like
[67:21] Blu-rays uh where a lot of people like
[67:23] oh Blu-ray technology is great and then
[67:25] like like oh we jump to digital things
[67:27] so I hope the cbdcs are like Blu-rays
[67:30] where like everyone is like oh yeah
[67:31] digital digital digital and it's it's no
[67:34] no it's Bitcoin not not digital Euro at
[67:37] least that's that that that's my hope to
[67:39] it I'm really cool that there's like a
[67:42] lot of other topics that I want to go
[67:43] through but there's already our our time
[67:45] over one hour uh so let's start with the
[67:48] end routine of the podcasts where I ask
[67:51] two questions the first question is
[67:52] always the same question for every guest
[67:54] and the question is what can we learn
[67:56] from you besides all the things that we
[67:58] already talked about oh wow wow I wish I
[68:01] would have prepared for this I notice
[68:03] now that I have not finished the
[68:05] podcasts that I looked that I watched
[68:09] with you honestly I think the most
[68:12] important thing with everything I do is
[68:14] I just want to be a good person I want
[68:17] to be a kind person and uh this is
[68:20] something that I as I mentioned find
[68:23] really in Bitcoin in this supportive
[68:27] community and whether you're looking for
[68:29] a job or for uh building a business or
[68:33] being successful in any way it is much
[68:36] easier if you are a likable kind person
[68:39] that serves other people um and if we
[68:42] all do that then uh yeah we can all help
[68:45] each other to
[68:47] succeed that's beautiful really cool um
[68:50] yeah thank you so much uh now the the
[68:52] other end routine where the previous
[68:54] guest is asking a question question for
[68:55] the next guest without knowing who the
[68:57] next guest actually is um and your
[68:59] question from the previous guest is who
[69:01] was the last person you orange pilled in
[69:03] real life and how did you do that uh I
[69:06] don't really believe in Orange
[69:08] pilling
[69:10] uh I will talk to bitcoin about any with
[69:14] anybody who comes to me and wants to
[69:17] know about it and I will happily share
[69:19] everything but I've
[69:22] stopped pushing my knowledge or my
[69:24] passion on people yeah in the very
[69:27] beginning I would send people SS and
[69:29] help them install wallets and then yeah
[69:32] a year or so later they would not
[69:34] remember where their wallets are and the
[69:36] I just wasted all my precious
[69:39] SS so yeah and we all I mean for us it's
[69:43] Bitcoin but maybe we have friends who
[69:46] keep talking to us about keto and about
[69:49] this and that and maybe we are not ready
[69:51] to hear that and until we have a problem
[69:54] that we're trying to solve so I believe
[69:57] that anybody is only motivated to learn
[70:01] about Bitcoin once they have a problem
[70:04] that Bitcoin can solve that is the
[70:06] moment when they are open when they are
[70:08] teachable coachable um and ready to hear
[70:11] about it but until then we will just get
[70:13] on our friends nerves so I'm not orange
[70:17] peing anybody no nice I think that's I
[70:21] think it's actually a good approach
[70:22] because if you wait then to for bit coin
[70:25] to come for for people to come to you uh
[70:29] and it's it's a way better approach and
[70:31] I also do that since h two three years
[70:34] now and it's uh feels way better and and
[70:36] they actually learn something and they
[70:38] actually make progress because you don't
[70:40] push it down the fro they actually want
[70:42] to learn it from you so like that that's
[70:44] a it's a big shift um yeah really cool
[70:47] thank you so much uh Anya for being on
[70:49] thank you so much for for being part of
[70:51] the show before I let you go where can
[70:53] people find you where can people ask you
[70:54] questions
[70:57] yeah so I think the best so we have a
[71:00] webs I say we because I have a team now
[71:02] uh bit
[71:03] location.com is uh the website right now
[71:06] it links to a substack uh but I hope to
[71:09] have a proper website soon and I think
[71:12] the best place is is telegram bit
[71:15] vocation feed for anybody who's looking
[71:17] for a job um there are daily updates all
[71:20] the jobs we scraping so that's the best
[71:22] address and I also post every now and
