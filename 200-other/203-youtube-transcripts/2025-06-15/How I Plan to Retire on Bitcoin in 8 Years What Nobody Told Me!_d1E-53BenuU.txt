[00:00] You could definitely retire in two
[00:01] cycles. Many people can escape the 9
[00:03] to5, escape uh the matrix, as they say.
[00:06] We've seen, like I say, like 65%
[00:08] compound growth. If you're very
[00:10] aggressive in Bitcoin, when you finally
[00:11] get that orange pill inside of you, uh
[00:13] now I'm just kind of going to focus on
[00:15] Bitcoin more. Now that I have more free
[00:17] time, I can focus on my passions, which
[00:19] Bitcoin is obviously a big part of that.
[00:21] I'm still living out here in Chiang Mai,
[00:23] right? Like I'm not trying to blow all
[00:25] my money. Uh I'm I'm not a
[00:27] multi-millionaire or anything like that.
[00:28] But I'm not living in Dubai, that's for
[00:30] sure. Uh but you know, maybe maybe next
[00:33] cycle. It's a net positive. Uh everyone
[00:35] who's holding Bitcoin is going to see
[00:37] Bitcoin become much more scarce with
[00:38] Black Rockck acquiring so much of it. Uh
[00:40] I don't think they can really wield too
[00:42] much power by holding unless they were
[00:43] to somehow dump it all at once, which I
[00:45] don't think is really
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] possible. Who told me you uh uh you
[00:53] actually quit your job or are you doing
[00:55] it now full-time Bitcoin?
[00:57] Yeah. Well, I'm doing, you know,
[00:58] whatever Bitcoin side hustles I have,
[01:00] you know, like I I work with Bitcoin
[01:02] wealth, so onboarding people from
[01:04] America and Canada. So, uh, working to
[01:07] to onboard people that way. And, uh,
[01:09] just, you know, a few other things. Uh,
[01:11] I am a landlord with, uh, couple condos
[01:13] I have in Canada. So, couple little side
[01:15] hustles, but, uh, going to be living off
[01:17] of my, uh, investments that I made
[01:20] mostly, uh, over Bitcoin over the course
[01:22] of the years. And you're right, man. Uh
[01:24] it is uh me breaking the news here first
[01:27] on the Robin Ser podcast uh that I quit
[01:30] my job back in Canada. So, uh, I've been
[01:33] was, uh, working for Canada Post as a
[01:35] supervisor like the last 10 years of my
[01:36] life. And you know I work worked hard
[01:39] stack sats and kind of this has always
[01:40] been part of my master plan I think to
[01:42] you know escape the Canadian winters and
[01:44] come on out somewhere where it's more
[01:46] affordable somewhere where I can uh
[01:48] huddle my sats for a few years and wait
[01:51] for my assets to appreciate further and
[01:53] hopefully you know as time goes on can
[01:55] can live a higher quality of life uh you
[01:58] know after stacking for so many years
[02:00] and just hopefully doing the right thing
[02:02] and uh so yeah that's breaking news man.
[02:05] Uh it's a big everything's changing for
[02:06] me right now. It's it's super awesome to
[02:09] see. Is that um because you're now doing
[02:13] more in Bitcoin and you have more income
[02:16] there or is it just because you have a
[02:18] bigger stack where you can actually have
[02:19] the security and and and retire more or
[02:22] less? Yeah, it's definitely for for the
[02:24] bigger stack. Uh you know, I believe in
[02:26] you know, definitely putting in your
[02:28] work and saving, making the right
[02:29] decisions, taking the right risks. And
[02:32] you know, without uh my stack of
[02:33] Bitcoin, I wouldn't be here. here. I'd
[02:34] still be working in Canada. I'd still be
[02:37] uh investing in other things. Real if
[02:38] Bitcoin didn't exist, I'd be at home
[02:40] probably working uh you know, investing
[02:42] more into real estate, more into
[02:43] investments and stocks, but luckily we
[02:45] have Bitcoin, which is a great hope for
[02:47] many of us. Uh and you too, Robin. So,
[02:50] uh now I'm just kind of going to focus
[02:51] on Bitcoin more. Now that I have more
[02:53] free time, I can focus on my passions,
[02:56] which Bitcoin is obviously a big part of
[02:58] that, and along with some other things.
[03:00] So, it's mostly the, you know, the
[03:03] ability to um stack the stats over the
[03:05] years and just buy at lower prices and u
[03:07] be able to accumulate a little bit now
[03:09] where, you know, I have a couple years
[03:10] of of living. So, I don't have to rely
[03:12] on going to a 9 to5 and doing something
[03:14] doing work for somebody else. Uh cuz I
[03:17] started that job when I was 25 years
[03:19] old. So, now I'm 36. So now I can focus
[03:22] on myself, develop my own skills, focus
[03:25] on uh the Bitcoin community and you know
[03:27] discovering Bitcoin Chiang Mai uh and
[03:29] this learning center here has been huge
[03:31] as well. Not to get out to all that
[03:32] right away. Uh but yeah, to answer your
[03:34] question, it's because of because of the
[03:37] investing that I've allowed myself to do
[03:38] that because I hold myself pretty
[03:40] fiscally
[03:42] uh a pretty fiscally conservative
[03:44] person. So uh I definitely wouldn't be
[03:47] risking it if I was going to go going to
[03:48] go broke in a couple of months.
[03:50] Yeah, it's it makes sense. It's it's
[03:53] also um I had a similar journey because
[03:56] uh uh last year I quit my job uh and and
[03:59] made the podcast full-time and I hadn't
[04:01] had income from the podcast. It was a
[04:04] podcast with like I think I had when I
[04:06] quit my job I had 500 600 subscribers
[04:08] and then you know it and and most people
[04:10] probably know it. You cannot live from
[04:11] that. um uh if you don't have any
[04:14] business and uh then because I quit I
[04:17] could uh resource uh uh locate all my
[04:20] resources to Bitcoin and all my
[04:22] resources to the podcast and then
[04:23] actually I can I can live off that which
[04:26] is is super super cool but I've only
[04:29] done that because I had a Bitcoin stack
[04:31] and I was like I can probably not live
[04:33] till the end of time from that Bitcoin
[04:34] stack but maybe I can survive long
[04:37] enough to start a a a great business and
[04:41] uh funny enough. I never had to to touch
[04:43] my Bitcoin stack in the time. Well,
[04:46] that's really great to hear, man. So,
[04:48] again, congratulations to you for doing
[04:49] that. And that's a big risk. It's a I'm
[04:51] sure it's a well- calculated risk. I'm
[04:53] sure you thought about it a lot. Uh, can
[04:55] I ask you? I wouldn't I wouldn't be so
[04:57] sure about that.
[05:00] It's it's Yeah, I thought about it a
[05:02] lot, but and at the end of the day, it
[05:03] was actually just
[05:05] uh a very emotional uh belly decision. I
[05:10] don't know if that's an English thing
[05:11] also, but in German we always say like
[05:12] if it's a from from the start make a
[05:15] decision. Uh, and it just felt right and
[05:17] I want to do it. And I was like, hey, if
[05:20] if I if I have a fear job that always
[05:22] distracts me, the other thing will never
[05:25] work out. So, let's just try it. And I'm
[05:29] 26 now. Now I'm 26. Back then I was 25.
[05:32] And I was like, if I stand in one year
[05:35] with like no income and all my Bitcoin
[05:38] are gone, I'm still just 26. So I I can
[05:41] I can I can start over. Yeah. Well,
[05:44] that's the biggest thing and that's what
[05:46] a lot of I don't want to say older
[05:48] people, but yeah, I guess like more
[05:50] mature people will say that about people
[05:51] in their 20s that you have all the time
[05:53] in the world to make the mistakes. Even
[05:54] like, you know, traditional financial
[05:56] investors will tell you that, oh, you're
[05:58] in your, you know, you're young, you
[05:59] should invest, you know, a little bit
[06:00] more risky now. And maybe they don't
[06:03] mean as going as so far as putting
[06:04] everything you have and overleveraging
[06:06] yourself into Bitcoin like many of us
[06:08] do, but uh you know that's it's a it's a
[06:11] good play, man. So, and I see you got,
[06:13] you know, sponsors now. I see you, uh,
[06:16] you know, you're making headway in in
[06:17] the podcast game. So, that's awesome,
[06:19] man. Absolutely. That's uh that's very
[06:22] very important. And I I applaud those
[06:25] companies that reached out to me very
[06:27] early on um and said like, "Hey, we want
[06:30] to support you and and here's
[06:31] something." And uh there was months
[06:33] where uh the sponsorship is going
[06:35] better, months where the sponsorship is
[06:38] going worse and they just kept
[06:40] supporting no matter what. So it's
[06:42] actually I think something that's not
[06:44] discussed often. uh we wouldn't had such
[06:47] great Bitcoin content if sponsors and uh
[06:51] companies wouldn't be uh willing to like
[06:53] hey let's let's support them. Uh
[06:56] obviously they make money with that so
[06:57] it's it's not a charity that they're
[06:58] running but in the end of the day it's a
[07:01] business decision. Uh but especially
[07:03] with smaller creators it's usually um
[07:06] not a win right away. Uh more more like
[07:08] a win later if they're getting bit
[07:11] bigger. So, uh, it's it's something I
[07:13] think I never I never talked about that
[07:15] in the podcast. It's funny, almost 500
[07:17] episodes now. But, uh, I I appreciate,
[07:20] uh, companies giving me, um, a little
[07:23] bit of trust beforehand when I was
[07:26] still, uh, way smaller and I'm I'm still
[07:29] consider my my podcast quite small
[07:31] because I want to grow it really big.
[07:33] But, uh, it it makes makes a lot of
[07:36] sense now also for the for the
[07:38] advertisement. So yeah, I'm al also uh
[07:41] how's it actually going with the H
[07:42] havinging report that you you're still
[07:44] doing the podcast?
[07:46] Yeah, still doing the podcast. However,
[07:47] just with the transition going
[07:49] international, moving abroad, uh comes
[07:51] with a lot of different things. So it's
[07:52] been a little bit slower, but now I'm
[07:54] getting a little bit more settled in Mai
[07:56] uh and Thailand, getting things figured
[07:58] out. Just moved to a different part of
[08:00] town in Chiang Mai for April. Uh need to
[08:03] get my license out here. Just working on
[08:05] some other things. Uh, but really
[08:07] wanting to get back into making more
[08:09] constant content. Uh, you know, being
[08:12] able to pump a episode out a day is
[08:14] awesome, man. And good for you. Uh, I
[08:16] think I might take um a little bit
[08:18] different approach now and just kind of
[08:19] focus on doing the ones I really want to
[08:21] do and and focusing on those when I can.
[08:24] Uh, and like I said, I'm in this for the
[08:26] long haul, man. So, I'm not I'm still
[08:28] going to be around doing them uh a
[08:30] couple months from now, couple years
[08:31] from now. You'll still see me moving
[08:32] around. Uh, but I was want to ask you,
[08:35] do do you I know you said a little bit
[08:36] earlier that you find yourself getting
[08:38] more motivated as time goes on to make
[08:41] these Bitcoin podcasts, but do you ever
[08:43] find yourself in a little bit uh podcast
[08:45] fatigue with recordings? Um, less um but
[08:50] with the process around it and keeping
[08:52] everything up more. So, it's there's a
[08:55] lot going on with inviting guests,
[08:59] communicating with guests because I have
[09:02] between three to 400 guests each year.
[09:05] Um uh just to give uh uh people a little
[09:08] bit of a uh conceptualizing for uh
[09:11] really big conferences like Bitcoin
[09:13] Prague for example uh they have around
[09:15] 10,000 people that come there every year
[09:18] and they only have 250 guests that that
[09:23] they have to accommodate. there's a lot
[09:24] of other things they have to do that I
[09:26] don't have to do but uh just
[09:28] communicating and um processing all
[09:32] those guests in in the appointment in
[09:34] the calendars and moving appointments. I
[09:37] have every week at least two free
[09:39] appointments that are moved uh because
[09:41] uh there are some family emergency
[09:43] someone got sick uh the internet broke
[09:46] down at that day and we have to do it
[09:47] tomorrow. So there's a lot I had fire
[09:50] alarms like I I've I've lived through
[09:52] almost everything that can happen. Um uh
[09:55] so uh that's why I also have now three
[09:58] people that uh three people sounds a lot
[10:01] but it's basically just one person. Uh
[10:03] so he three people do a job that one
[10:06] person also could do but I like to uh
[10:08] have those three people uh that work
[10:11] part time basically in the
[10:13] post-production um that do uh the
[10:16] titles, the thumbnails, the editings and
[10:18] the clips uh so I can focus more on the
[10:20] recording because the recording honestly
[10:22] there's no fatigue at all. I want to do
[10:24] it more often. That's that's the thing
[10:25] that makes fun. It also inspires more
[10:28] thoughts. Um but uh the process around
[10:32] it, keeping everything up and running uh
[10:34] and and uh doing the podcast on a
[10:37] broader scale, it's it's just I think uh
[10:41] and I've never went through that and I
[10:43] always hear it with businesses. you have
[10:45] that starting phase where it's all
[10:47] exciting and and really cool and and
[10:49] really nice and then there is like a
[10:52] plateau uh or like even like a small dip
[10:55] and you have to push through that where
[10:58] it might not feel that exciting anymore
[11:00] because it's the second year not the
[11:01] first year. um it's still growing, but
[11:04] it's not as exciting as as the first
[11:06] year and where you have to push through
[11:08] to actually go on the other side and
[11:10] actually have the major fruits of your
[11:13] labor. When you think about successful
[11:15] podcasts, they rarely are successful in
[11:18] the first year. Uh I I follow Chris
[11:21] Williams, I follow Jerome, I follow Lex
[11:23] Freedman, I follow all the uh Steven
[11:25] Bartley, all all the big ones, they
[11:28] usually don't even are monetized in the
[11:30] first year. uh the they that I even make
[11:33] money in the first year with podcasting
[11:35] is absolutely mindblowing for me. Uh and
[11:39] to see other podcast how long they took
[11:41] to make any uh progress um really
[11:45] inspires me and I think with any
[11:48] business is like you you have to you
[11:50] have to do the the boring things of like
[11:53] doing every day for very long extended
[11:56] period of time. And lucky for me I love
[11:59] doing the recording. So now it's all
[12:01] about how do I not do the other things
[12:04] myself.
[12:07] Yeah, exactly. That's the part that
[12:08] really that really fatigues you is all
[12:11] the background stuff, right? All the
[12:12] editing, all the all the little things
[12:14] that go in with it. I mean AI, this
[12:16] platform, Riverside FM, has made life a
[12:18] lot easier for for people like you and
[12:20] I. Uh however, there is still I mean you
[12:23] get what you put into it, right? So you
[12:24] could you could spend many hours. You
[12:26] could spend countless hours at at some
[12:28] point you just got to say, "Okay, I'm
[12:30] fine with this final final product." Cuz
[12:31] you got to move on to the next show,
[12:33] especially when you're doing them daily
[12:34] like you are. So, uh yeah, you know,
[12:36] totally totally can resonate with that
[12:38] for sure. I haven't uh I I saw on your
[12:42] Twitter you wrote something with ple
[12:44] retire in two cycles some something like
[12:47] that. Is is is that something uh that is
[12:50] uh that you wrote because it happened
[12:53] now for you or do you have some theory
[12:55] around that?
[12:56] You know what? I was just talking to to
[12:58] Neo, Jimmy's assistant here, and I was
[13:01] saying that yeah, I I strongly believe
[13:03] that within two cycles, which is about
[13:05] my timing right now, uh many people can
[13:08] escape the 9 to5, escape uh the matrix,
[13:11] as they say, and you know, live a very a
[13:15] pretty good life, uh comparative to
[13:17] where you started. So, uh you know,
[13:19] we've seen like you say like 65%
[13:21] compound growth. If you're very
[13:22] aggressive in Bitcoin, when you finally
[13:24] get that orange pill inside of you, you
[13:26] could you could definitely retire in two
[13:28] cycles. And I think I like I like just
[13:30] the term two cycles. I don't know, maybe
[13:32] there's maybe there's a new podcast
[13:33] segment coming. I don't know. But uh
[13:36] that's just kind of how I felt when I
[13:37] was making my last bio. Uh I just really
[13:40] want people to understand like the power
[13:41] of Bitcoin as a savings technology. And
[13:44] you know, that's just part of my Bitcoin
[13:47] personal campaign I would say at this
[13:48] point. But there's no. But yeah, it does
[13:50] align with myself and it does align with
[13:52] my greater beliefs around Bitcoin and
[13:54] how it's going to change humanity.
[13:56] There's this great 4% rule in fire um
[14:00] that I just talked about I think a few
[14:02] episodes ago um with Trey Salas uh from
[14:06] Unchained and he even says like with
[14:08] Bitcoin you can probably even make an 8%
[14:10] rule out of it. Are you are you familiar
[14:12] with the 4% rule from the fire
[14:14] community? No, I'm not. if you don't
[14:16] mind. It's
[14:19] basically um you if you want to retire,
[14:22] you have to have a target of what you
[14:25] have to accumulate on capital to um to
[14:28] retire on and and there's a way to
[14:31] figure out what is your uh target. You
[14:34] just take your yearly expenses
[14:37] uh and uh uh multiply that so you come
[14:43] to 100%. So, um, your yearly expenses
[14:45] should be 4% of your stack. So, let's
[14:48] say, uh, I explained that really badly
[14:50] right now, but let's let's make an
[14:51] example. uh if you have a million
[14:54] dollars in in in Bitcoin right now and
[14:57] you are uh uh yearly expenses of $40,000
[15:01] uh dollars a year, then you can actually
[15:04] from that 4% rule uh retire because the
[15:08] theory around that is if you spend 4% of
[15:12] your stack each year, your stack will
[15:15] actually outgrow
[15:17] uh uh your your cutting off the the
[15:20] stack long term. And there are many
[15:22] other theories around that but I think
[15:24] like
[15:25] 4% could be could be a good rule. Maybe
[15:29] in Bitcoin you should also
[15:32] see in in what part of cycle we are are
[15:36] we now at the uh uh Bitcoin bull cycle
[15:40] where we hit the 250,000 at the end of
[15:42] the year and then you can hit that 4%.
[15:44] Maybe wait till there's some retraction
[15:46] and then you still have the 4% maybe
[15:48] then it's a good idea. Uh, but yeah,
[15:50] it's it's fun to think about those
[15:52] retirement plans. Okay, so it sounds
[15:54] like I got some math to do after this
[15:56] podcast with my own and uh apply that 4%
[15:59] rule to myself. Uh, no, I like that
[16:01] though. And it seems like a pretty
[16:03] fiscally conservative number. I mean, if
[16:05] if Bitcoin's increasing, you know, 60 to
[16:07] 80% a year and you're and you're at 4% a
[16:10] year spending, uh, yeah, you should
[16:12] definitely definitely outpace definitely
[16:14] outpace uh, that rule. Yeah, that's why
[16:17] my theory and and Trey's theory, I stole
[16:20] that from Trey, sorry. Uh he says that
[16:24] is the 4% rule if you use Fiat. If you
[16:27] use Bitcoin, you actually can go um
[16:30] double that. So, you can spend 8% of
[16:32] your stack and you probably will still
[16:34] be fine. Uh the only thing with Bitcoin,
[16:37] the volatility is is higher. Uh, and
[16:41] yeah, I I I love that you also went
[16:43] ahead and said like, "Oh, I I now quit
[16:46] my job and I I will live now in a area
[16:50] where there's not as high of living
[16:52] costs." You're in it called Chi Mangi
[16:55] Chi Mang. Yeah. Chiangg Mai. Chiangg
[16:58] Mai. Chiangg Mai. I almost Yeah. Yeah.
[17:01] Almost got it. It's the second biggest
[17:02] city in Thailand and it's landlocked
[17:06] northern Thailand and it's just a it's a
[17:09] great city and it's got all the lowcost
[17:11] living like offered in most most of
[17:13] Thailand. Uh yeah, it's really great
[17:15] here. And yeah, it's, you know, coming
[17:17] where I'm from, you know, it's eight
[17:19] months of winter, so I'm like, why am I
[17:21] going to spend all, you know, winter
[17:22] here being miserable, spending twice as
[17:24] much money, where I can go have like a
[17:26] nice condo out here in Thailand, uh, you
[17:29] know, eat like a king every day for a
[17:31] few dollars. You know, you can go for
[17:34] hourlong Thai massage for $8 and you're
[17:37] just living really great out here. And
[17:39] it's a great way to, you know, if you
[17:41] need need to huddle for a few more
[17:43] years, maybe maybe until the next having
[17:44] and the next bull bull run, uh, it's a
[17:46] great place to do that. So, that's kind
[17:48] of my plan. Robin, I got my 5-year uh,
[17:50] DTV, which is the destination Thailand
[17:53] visa, and it's something new that came
[17:55] out last year that many expats and
[17:57] people are taking advantage of, and
[18:00] there's many ways that you can get it.
[18:02] The way I went was just signing up for a
[18:04] M Thai uh, Core at a gym called Core
[18:08] Combat. And this is a six-month program.
[18:10] It cost me about $500 US. And it got me
[18:12] a fiveyear visa. And I can stay up to
[18:14] six months at at a time with the
[18:16] extension to uh for another six months.
[18:18] So potentially could only have to leave
[18:20] uh once a year. You do have to check in
[18:22] with immigration every few months. Uh
[18:24] however, you know, they're really
[18:27] recognizing that tourism is their main
[18:29] industry here and they want to take
[18:31] advantage of that. So, a lot of great
[18:33] things in Thailand and I know you were
[18:35] just talking to Jimmy on your last
[18:37] podcast or one of the last few podcasts
[18:39] uh that you did and I know he was
[18:40] telling you about kind of things that
[18:42] are happening here in Thailand. It might
[18:44] be a lot more crypto friendly uh very
[18:46] soon here. how for people that because
[18:48] most of my audience comes from America,
[18:51] Canada, UK, uh Europe, uh Thailand
[18:54] probably has a very small uh small
[18:57] percentage uh but I guess
[19:01] growing. What is the difference of the
[19:04] living expense that you had in Canada
[19:06] versus you have now? How much how much
[19:09] cheaper is it? Is it like 10% or like
[19:11] onetenth of the cost or Yeah, it's
[19:15] probably Well, rent for for for
[19:17] starters. I was paying about $2,000 for
[19:20] my mortgage or $2,000 Canadian. I'm
[19:22] saying for So, what's that like 17 maybe
[19:26] 1,600 US, right? Uh now I'm paying about
[19:28] a quarter of that uh out here in
[19:30] Thailand. So, I just I just signed a
[19:32] 3-month lease, and I'm paying
[19:35] $450 a month for that, plus electricity
[19:38] and and uh water, which is not too much
[19:41] extra. Um, so
[19:43] $450 to to to pay to to live here in uh
[19:47] Chiang Mai and have all the luxuries.
[19:49] And then again, going out to eat is like
[19:51] a couple of dollars. It all depends. If
[19:52] you want to eat at a nice nicer
[19:54] restaurant, you can find them. Uh but
[19:56] really like an expensive meal out here
[19:57] is probably like, you know,5 to$10 US
[20:01] dollars. So, you know, most meals you
[20:03] can go eat just local Thai food for a
[20:05] couple of dollars. Uh so it's it's
[20:08] depending on what you're talking about.
[20:10] Overall living expenses is probably like
[20:12] 30% of what you're paying probably in US
[20:14] or Canada. Uh and depending depending on
[20:16] what you're talking about, rent
[20:17] specifically or or food. Food is much
[20:20] cheaper, I would say. Uh but yeah,
[20:22] everything's way cheaper and even
[20:23] compared to to El Salvador. Uh what I
[20:26] was talking to uh who was I talk I was
[20:29] talking to somebody about going out
[20:30] there and renting a spot from them. Uh
[20:32] Ronnie from the Bitcoin hardware store
[20:34] uh had a place for rent for $800. So now
[20:38] I'm paying, you know, almost half that
[20:39] here in in Chiang Mai in a big in a big
[20:42] ass city. Whereas there Bitcoin Beach
[20:44] is, you know, has different allures. Uh
[20:47] but you're you're kind of, you know,
[20:49] there's only so much room in Bitcoin
[20:50] Beach, right? The the price of real
[20:52] estate's going up a lot. You know, you
[20:53] got the beach right there. So, you can't
[20:55] really build out uh where Chiang Mai's
[20:57] got uh cheaper living. It's just it's a
[20:59] definitely a lot different than uh you
[21:01] know, Western or or America, South
[21:03] America, Central America. A lot
[21:05] different out here. Uh but once you get
[21:07] out here, man, everything's so cheap and
[21:08] and awesome. It's it's pretty cool. How
[21:11] big of a a condo do you get for 450? I I
[21:14] I am just looking at uh Changai pictures
[21:17] and maybe bringing up uh while you share
[21:19] a little bit. I think maybe like 400
[21:22] square meters. Wait, 400 square meters.
[21:25] No, sorry. Not 400. 40. Sorry. Usually I
[21:28] go by square feet. So, uh, it's probably
[21:31] like I don't know, 700. I Yeah, I don't
[21:34] know what the conversion is. 400 400 ft.
[21:38] Yeah, I guess it's 10x. Um, but it's
[21:40] nice. It's got a nice balcony, man. Uh,
[21:43] it's got everything I need uh in a nice
[21:45] uh bustling part of town. So for for
[21:48] like a guy that's just going to be me
[21:50] there, then it's it works out pretty
[21:53] good. So if you're looking to and that's
[21:55] actually something I want to start
[21:56] campaigning, Robin, is you know, come to
[21:58] come to Thailand, man. Bitcoiners should
[22:00] come to Thailand. With all the
[22:01] legislation coming, you can be, you
[22:02] know, on the forefront of, you know,
[22:05] Bitcoin development and adoption here.
[22:07] Uh seems like the the government's being
[22:08] very friendly. They just approved
[22:10] Jimmy's uh Bitcoin marathon event. Uh
[22:13] and like I said, they're going to have
[22:14] legislation and uh Bitcoin pilot program
[22:16] coming down to Phuket and then Chiangg
[22:19] Mai where I live. Uh where the Bitcoin
[22:21] learning center here is uh it's going to
[22:23] be here later on hopefully uh after the
[22:25] Phuket rollout. What it entirely looks
[22:27] like that looks like I don't know 100%
[22:30] but uh yeah. What what are you looking
[22:32] at there? Just pictures of Chiang Mai. I
[22:35] just put Mai in in Google and they all
[22:38] look so beautiful. Is it is it that how
[22:41] it looks? Actually, on I Yeah, I swear
[22:43] to God there's temples like this
[22:44] everywhere in town. There's I mean that
[22:46] you kind of get they're they're Buddhist
[22:48] temples and I don't know once I've been
[22:50] in a few, you know, I kind of just go to
[22:52] the special ones. Maybe there's one at
[22:54] the top of a mountain now. There's so
[22:55] many here in town. There's so many night
[22:57] markets and live music here. Uh it just
[23:00] almost seems like too good to be true
[23:01] some. And uh I don't know. I'm Canadian,
[23:04] so I like my cannabis, too. So when I
[23:05] got here, I had no idea that there was
[23:08] cannabis shops everywhere. Uh so I'm
[23:10] like, "Oh, you know, I'm not going to
[23:11] smoke anymore." And then I got here and
[23:12] it's like, "Oh, wow. There it's
[23:13] everywhere." Like this is crazy. So um
[23:16] you know, it's the only place in
[23:17] Southeast Asia you can smoke a joint um
[23:20] safely and and legally. And uh with the
[23:24] Bitcoin development, it's just like I
[23:27] don't know. Thai Thai actually
[23:29] translates to to free. So it means free
[23:32] land. Awesome. I also see a population
[23:36] is a good size. Like it's it's it's not
[23:38] small, but it's also not huge. So, it's
[23:41] probably like a a very uh good sized
[23:44] city. Chiang Mai. Does it say 100,000?
[23:49] Maybe I got the wrong one. Is Is that
[23:51] the right one? No, I think I think I I
[23:54] think it's a lot bigger than that. Let
[23:56] me just check Brock real quick because I
[23:59] thought it was a lot bigger than that.
[24:00] Yeah, 100K is like a a smaller kind of
[24:03] city. I mean, it's it's a area has a
[24:07] population of approximately 1.2 million
[24:10] people as of 122. Oh, that's that makes
[24:13] more sense. Yeah. Yeah. I think the
[24:14] month municipality, the official city
[24:16] center. Uh so we're just talking about
[24:18] the I think that population of 127,000
[24:21] is actually just the old town. So a big
[24:23] allure here is old town. So if you zoom
[24:25] in onto a map of Chiang Mai, you'll see
[24:27] a square and it's that's what we call
[24:29] old town and it's uh surrounded by a
[24:31] moat of water, you know, the for
[24:33] protection uh back in the day when wars
[24:36] were more prevalent. And uh that's that
[24:40] 100,000 number is just for that old
[24:42] town, that square you see, which is just
[24:44] a a small part of the greater area, but
[24:47] it's like the most coolest and most
[24:49] attractive part, right? If you zoom in a
[24:51] little bit
[24:52] more, see? Yes. See, it's a square.
[24:54] There's a square like that. That's
[24:56] interesting. Yeah, that's what it is.
[24:58] So, that's that's where it says
[25:00] population ofund and some odd thousand.
[25:02] And then the greater area is like one
[25:04] point, you know, 1.2 million or whatever
[25:06] it said. Is that is that square street
[25:08] or what is that? Mhm. Yeah, it's a road
[25:12] going going all around the city. And
[25:14] it's also it's got part of like the
[25:16] ancient uh gates. You see like the FA
[25:19] gate there in purple. Uh it's like a
[25:21] tourist attraction. People come and take
[25:22] pictures in front of the bricks. There's
[25:24] uh pigeons, you know, people like to get
[25:27] good snap, good pictures of the pigeons
[25:29] flying away while you're standing in
[25:30] front of the bricks. It's kind of like
[25:32] a, you know, classic picture everybody
[25:34] takes here. Uh but yeah, there's this
[25:36] whole old square is just full of great
[25:38] restaurants, narrow streets that kind of
[25:40] I've never been to Europe, but it like
[25:42] feels like Europe. And
[25:44] uh yeah, it's just it's just so super
[25:47] cool. Feels like a garden city. And
[25:49] there's just a lot of cool things to do.
[25:52] And yeah, I'm going to be posted up here
[25:53] for at least uh at least till, you know,
[25:56] a few at least a few more months anyway,
[25:58] maybe 6 months at the end of the year.
[25:59] Like I said, I'm doing training right
[26:01] now. So, I'm I'm going to a M Thai uh
[26:03] training a couple times a week, as much
[26:04] as I can can, as much as my body is
[26:06] letting me to do that at 36 years old.
[26:09] But uh yeah, it's it's super cool, man.
[26:12] So, I'm not sure what your plans are,
[26:14] Robin. Uh but uh yeah, if you're ever
[26:16] looking to come abroad, you got this
[26:18] whole Bitcoin learning center. You can
[26:19] do your podcast from here. They have all
[26:21] the equipment that you need and um yeah,
[26:25] there's some there's some great things
[26:26] out here. Great advantages to being out
[26:28] here, man. Oh, awesome. Awesome. If I
[26:31] ever get sick of Austria, which is is
[26:34] not as impossible as as some might not
[26:37] uh think, uh it's it's very much a thing
[26:42] where I conclude. I I love that they
[26:44] have the streets around the old town and
[26:48] it looks like a castle like you know
[26:50] like it it it's like protected with this
[26:52] double street and the in the water in
[26:54] between. Uh there's probably some gates
[26:56] and uh it I I never was there but just
[27:00] from the map and what you're saying and
[27:01] and the few pictures that I saw it's
[27:04] probably just very cool just to visit
[27:06] for like one two weeks probably. Oh for
[27:09] sure. I mean, if that's what you can,
[27:11] you know, that's that's actually what a
[27:12] lot of the city is. And what's really
[27:14] cool about being here is that people
[27:16] come for a week or two all from all over
[27:18] the world. So, me being here, I'm get to
[27:20] meet people from all over the world, uh,
[27:22] coming through here and it's super
[27:25] interesting. Um, especially compared
[27:26] from where I am where it's just all, you
[27:28] know, white Canadian folk in my area
[27:30] mostly. Uh, maybe some, you know, people
[27:32] from Toronto come down, but, you know,
[27:34] here is people from all over the place.
[27:36] And yeah, it's a great place if, like I
[27:38] said, if you want to stay for a longer
[27:39] period of time, but uh it's also great
[27:42] just to pass through, which a lot of
[27:44] people do. A lot of backpackers come
[27:45] through and you know, people can
[27:48] recognize other travelers and most
[27:50] people think I'm a traveler, but I'm
[27:52] actually stationary here for a bit now,
[27:54] but uh cool spot, man. Really cool spot.
[27:57] Awesome. Yeah. And it uh I want to get
[28:00] back to the point of of the superpower
[28:02] of Bitcoin. I often uh make that and and
[28:05] many others did that before me, but I
[28:08] love that comparison so much with the
[28:09] fist fight. You know, you have the fist
[28:12] fight and when you show up to to like
[28:16] five people and they they fight with
[28:17] their fists and you are the only guy
[28:20] with a gun, you will win that fight.
[28:22] like it it's very easy for you to win
[28:24] that fight. In the same way as the
[28:28] cities and the people with electricity
[28:30] won over those who don't have
[28:32] electricity, the people that early
[28:35] adopted the internet and built something
[28:36] in the internet won over those who don't
[28:39] adopted the internet. The same way I see
[28:41] it now with Bitcoin. those people who
[28:43] have electricity, gunpowder,
[28:46] um the internet and Bitcoin, they will
[28:49] win over the people that don't have
[28:51] those innovations in their hand. And you
[28:53] are one amazing example that uh you had
[28:57] 10 years uh the job as a supervisor
[28:59] there. Um and now because of Bitcoin,
[29:04] you can actually do whatever you want to
[29:06] do. You can retire, you can focus on
[29:07] Bitcoin, you you live there, you you can
[29:10] uh move around the world freely.
[29:12] That's just an awesome story. And and
[29:15] you said like you're 36 years, so you're
[29:16] super young also. Well, yeah, man. Uh it
[29:19] sounds really great when you put it like
[29:20] that, but I mean I mean I'm still living
[29:22] out here in Chiang Mai, right? Like I'm
[29:24] not trying to blow all my money. Uh I'm
[29:26] I'm not a multi-millionaire or anything
[29:28] like that. I'm not living in Dubai,
[29:29] that's for sure. Uh but, you know, maybe
[29:32] maybe next cycle. So, just trying to be,
[29:34] you know, live well. Uh be uh somewhat
[29:38] frugal the next couple years. uh here's
[29:40] a great place to do it, man. Rather than
[29:42] sitting in an office for the next, you
[29:43] know, 3 to four years for for the next
[29:45] having cycle uh where hopefully my
[29:47] assets appreciate even further, you
[29:49] know, maybe uh in a couple years I can
[29:51] go travel and live other places in the
[29:53] world as well. That's, you know, that's
[29:54] kind of part of my master plan and uh
[29:57] hopefully we'll be sitting here talking
[29:58] about it. Uh maybe when I move to
[30:00] Austria in 4 years or something. Let's
[30:02] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[30:04] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[30:08] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[30:10] are the most amazing, the most elegant
[30:13] way of showing that you are a true
[30:16] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[30:18] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:21] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:24] collections. You have the date of the
[30:26] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[30:30] and of course also the block height and
[30:32] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[30:35] the level of detail they put in in this
[30:38] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[30:40] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:44] down in the descriptions. I love those
[30:46] watches so so much. And now if you have
[30:49] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[30:52] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[30:54] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[30:56] to deal with that. The first way is you
[30:58] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:00] entry for you to get into the
[31:03] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[31:06] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:09] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:12] check out the link in the description,
[31:14] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:17] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:20] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:23] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:26] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:28] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:31] that is perfect for your individual
[31:34] situation. They will show you how you
[31:36] can secure your own devices. Securing
[31:39] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[31:41] have to keep all your devices secure.
[31:44] One topic that is overlooked often is
[31:46] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[31:49] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[31:52] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[31:54] place already? And last but not least,
[31:56] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[31:58] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:01] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[32:06] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:09] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:12] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:14] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:17] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:19] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:21] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:24] the link down in the description of
[32:26] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:28] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:32] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:35] there. I would welcome you in Austria,
[32:38] too. Like uh and uh but the rents are
[32:40] high. I think I pay
[32:43] €1,400 plus electricity. 1,450 I think I
[32:47] pay for the electricity and everything
[32:50] going on. But it is going to be it's
[32:52] just going to be a summer. It's going to
[32:53] be a summer thing.
[32:56] Then it's easy. I have a guest room for
[32:58] you.
[33:01] Really cool. Um let's talk a little bit
[33:04] about nation state game theory as you
[33:07] have you came from Canada. You've seen
[33:09] now what's going on in Thailand. you
[33:11] probably listen to what's going on in
[33:13] America and you also uh have been to El
[33:16] Salvador and seen what's going on there.
[33:18] What is the for you the current state of
[33:21] nation nation state the game theory
[33:23] behind that and where do you see things
[33:25] going? Yeah, it's a great question. Uh,
[33:27] you know, I wish I had a crystal ball
[33:29] for it, but you know, we're seeing the
[33:31] biggest, you know, empire and human
[33:33] history, the the American empire, uh,
[33:36] start to adopt Bitcoin, which, you know,
[33:38] I don't definitely don't agree with, uh,
[33:39] everything the Trump administration is
[33:41] doing, but that is one thing that is on
[33:43] on the plus side is adopting a national
[33:46] Bitcoin reserve. And that's actually
[33:49] going to be huge and I think is going to
[33:52] probably have a some sort of trickle
[33:53] effect where other countries are now
[33:55] going to start looking at that strategy
[33:56] as well. So this could be a very
[33:58] interesting cycle or maybe you know
[34:00] maybe it gets stifled again and we wait
[34:02] for another for another four years of of
[34:05] building and adoption until it really
[34:06] kicks in. But um I really think scarcity
[34:10] is at effect. So later this year, you
[34:13] know, we're probably going to see a
[34:14] little bit of a a squeeze in supply. So,
[34:17] I think that the current state is, you
[34:21] know, obviously America being at the
[34:23] forefront of of changing their their
[34:25] policy and their outlook and what
[34:26] they're going to do with Bitcoin. Uh, so
[34:28] I think that other nations are still
[34:30] going to follow are going to follow once
[34:33] something gets fully implemented. I know
[34:35] right now that they're not actually, you
[34:37] know, not trying to spend any taxpayer
[34:39] money on buying Bitcoin, but looking at
[34:42] u, you know, revenue neutral ways to
[34:44] acquire as much as they can. uh not
[34:46] selling not selling what they have. Uh
[34:48] so I think you know nation state
[34:51] adoption is is absolutely huge right
[34:53] because they have the most money. Uh you
[34:55] know corporations are also
[34:56] simultaneously starting to adopt. We
[34:58] just saw GameStop uh you know that have
[35:02] over a billion dollars that they're
[35:03] looking to uh get some Bitcoin exposure
[35:05] to and we've seen the success of other
[35:08] companies that have done that in the
[35:09] past. So, you know, nation state
[35:10] adoption with big corporation adoption,
[35:12] you know, this could be uh definitely be
[35:14] a super cycle potential, but you know, I
[35:16] don't want to go out there and say that
[35:17] that that's for sure going to happen
[35:19] because I don't know. And, you know,
[35:20] last obviously last cycle we were kind
[35:22] of disappointed we never hit the 100K
[35:24] mark. You know, we topped out at 69 or
[35:26] whatever it was. Uh but yeah, the
[35:28] current state is uh we're we're kind of
[35:31] eyes on America. Uh in terms of
[35:34] Thailand, you know, if you're out here,
[35:35] there's more eyes on on here. The
[35:37] Bitcoin community is looking at us a
[35:38] little bit right now because of of this
[35:40] center and what Jimmy's doing for the
[35:42] community and trying to push it or or
[35:45] educate actual Thai people in their in
[35:47] their home language. So, uh I I don't
[35:50] know the situation for every nation. I'm
[35:52] sure they're all starting to look at
[35:54] now, but it's come a long way from, you
[35:56] know, the days of even when I got in, it
[35:58] was just like magic internet money and
[36:00] people thought I'm crazy. And now, you
[36:02] know, we got the whole world freaking
[36:03] adopt adopting this this digital coin.
[36:06] Uh so I think scarcity is going to play
[36:08] a big effect and yeah the state is we're
[36:10] kind of watching we're walk watching
[36:12] regulation develop. We're still we're
[36:14] still watching it but you know the big
[36:16] move is obviously uh watching American
[36:18] policy is you know they have some of the
[36:20] most money in the world and you know
[36:24] China I'd like to see something happen
[36:26] with China but I really don't know the
[36:27] state. I'm not too optimistic about uh
[36:30] Bitcoin friendly uh policies in China,
[36:32] but uh you know, as we know, a lot of
[36:34] the most of the Bitcoin mining power
[36:36] does come from China. So, uh I feel like
[36:38] at some point they're going to have to,
[36:41] you know, own in on this advantage that
[36:43] they have. So, uh before America starts
[36:46] to make some sort of uh friendly more
[36:48] friendly mining policies, which meant
[36:50] could be some sort of competition. So, I
[36:52] think it's good. I think it's really
[36:54] good that uh nations are starting to
[36:55] adopt it and make some sort of strategy.
[36:58] Uh it's going to be in their, you know,
[37:00] in their national interest to do so. Uh
[37:03] yeah, the status is we're kind of
[37:05] standing by waiting for waiting for
[37:07] stuff to happen and we're in a good
[37:08] spot, I think. Uh 100%. That's that's
[37:12] awesome to hear. And I'm as you uh
[37:16] amazed that retail is still sleeping. We
[37:20] I've talked to many exchanges, many
[37:24] people that ga data and they're all
[37:27] saying basically the same thing. If you
[37:29] look just at the retail numbers, we are
[37:32] still not in a bull market. The bull
[37:35] market hasn't started for retail folks.
[37:37] The bull market has started for people
[37:40] that were already in Bitcoin. They're
[37:42] now going deeper and going more
[37:45] aggressive into Bitcoin. uh bull market
[37:47] has bull market has started from an
[37:49] institutional side maybe even from a
[37:51] nation state side a little bit but
[37:53] they're very cautious and uh it just
[37:55] takes a very long time they actually
[37:58] come into the game but it's mostly
[38:00] institutional buying and ETFs buying uh
[38:03] that drives not a not a price retail is
[38:05] just ah bitcoin is 100k who cares
[38:11] yeah definitely uh well that's good to
[38:13] hear so yeah if if the bull will run
[38:16] hasn't even started yet, then you know,
[38:17] I should be in a good spot. We should
[38:19] all be in a really good spot. Um, and
[38:21] I'm glad to hear that's your sentiment
[38:23] because I know you're talking to a lot
[38:24] of Bitcoiners out there. So, I'm sure
[38:25] you're acquiring uh a good all, you
[38:28] know, well-rounded opinion on the space.
[38:30] Have you made any predictions yourself
[38:32] or called what you think might be the
[38:33] top? Oh, I have no clue whatsoever. I
[38:36] don't even know if if uh if if if
[38:40] because you see I think um the cycles
[38:43] are extremely
[38:44] predictable
[38:46] previously but this can change at any
[38:48] time but we don't know if it changes now
[38:51] or or or or later but what I want to see
[38:56] maybe I want to show you and get your
[38:58] your take on on on this also uh just for
[39:01] people to to see that we have an amazing
[39:05] tool to kind of see what's going on with
[39:09] the world. Uh because Google can not
[39:12] only track the web searches but also
[39:14] like YouTube and and and more data like
[39:16] that and they also have the AI things.
[39:19] If we type in buy Bitcoin and I actually
[39:22] like to use buy Bitcoin and not just
[39:24] Bitcoin to track the the the folks that
[39:27] are interested in in buying Bitcoin. if
[39:30] we explore that and we have to obviously
[39:32] go out in the worldwide and uh go out as
[39:36] long as as we can. We've seen a massive
[39:40] spike obviously in 2017 this was the
[39:42] craziest spike ever seen and this was
[39:46] also the first time where I heard about
[39:47] Bitcoin then
[39:49] 2021
[39:51] was kind of crazy but for me it was a
[39:55] cycle that cut was cut short. uh the
[39:58] China thing was coming out uh Elon Musk
[40:00] was uh coming on and off uh and it was a
[40:03] little bit of confusion. So it was from
[40:04] sentiment maybe a little bit cut short
[40:07] and now we are not even like if we 7% of
[40:12] where we were in 2017 but the price is
[40:15] 4x as high. So, so uh that that's just
[40:20] uh some data and the interesting thing
[40:23] web searches uh people say okay maybe
[40:26] people don't search as much anymore. Uh
[40:28] when we go to YouTube data it's a little
[40:31] less uh crazy. So we actually we were in
[40:34] 2021 of of 74% and we're now at 27%. So
[40:40] sentiment is is down. People are not as
[40:43] interested in in in buying Bitcoin.
[40:45] Actually also I saw it in my own YouTube
[40:47] chart. Uh January, February were way
[40:50] better than now March is and now it's
[40:52] it's actually goes up a little bit again
[40:54] but I don't know how how good of an
[40:56] indicator my own channel is. Could also
[40:58] be an other factors. So overall I would
[41:02] just say re and yeah then I also have
[41:05] the data just of my subjective reality
[41:08] of me speaking to friends me speaking
[41:11] being in in in friend circles. I just
[41:14] see that they're not as interested as
[41:16] they were 2021. I was not around in
[41:19] 2017. I so I cannot really compare it to
[41:22] to that time. So the from all the things
[41:25] that I talk with uh people on the
[41:28] podcast, what I see from Google Trends
[41:30] and all the data that we can gather and
[41:32] from my own subjective feelings, I think
[41:36] we are in a in a retail bare market.
[41:40] Retail bare market. Okay. Yeah. I
[41:43] curious how much weight these things
[41:45] actually carry, but you know, based on
[41:46] these trends and comparing to the price
[41:48] appreciation like in 2017, uh you know,
[41:51] it seems like they're they're pretty
[41:53] correlated here. So, um yeah, the
[41:56] question also becomes if we ever get to
[41:59] a crazy town like 2017 again. Uh, and
[42:02] I'm curious what what you think uh
[42:04] around that because
[42:06] maybe maybe Bitcoin isn't the asset that
[42:10] will be mass adopted by retail folks,
[42:13] but rather gets adopted more and more by
[42:16] institutions and nation states and then
[42:19] kind of gets forced into the mainstream
[42:22] in a similar way as the internet got got
[42:25] adopted, a similar way as everything
[42:27] kind of gets adopted. I'm I'm not I
[42:29] don't know if you have an opinion on
[42:30] that, but I'm also not sure how how it
[42:33] will shake out. Sorry, what's the
[42:36] question? Sorry. Um maybe it's not a not
[42:40] a real question, but when we have now
[42:45] more and more retail folks kind of
[42:48] sleeping on it, but we also at the same
[42:49] time have more and more institutions
[42:51] buying Bitcoin and seeing Bitcoin and
[42:54] this is actually developing faster than
[42:55] the the retail side. My question is is
[42:59] it maybe that institutions and uh
[43:04] nations or let's say just institutions
[43:06] for for for that are they driving the
[43:10] massive adoption long term and then
[43:12] bringing it back down into uh society.
[43:17] So like the first 10 15 years was almost
[43:20] only retail. There were not a lot of
[43:21] institutions even into in Bitcoin. Maybe
[43:25] we just have reached a point where the
[43:29] people that are interested now in
[43:31] Bitcoin are already in there somehow and
[43:33] they just go deeper in there and the
[43:36] rest kind of like the we maybe there's
[43:39] like an early majority and then the uh
[43:42] the the the the early adopters and the
[43:44] early majority and maybe just as a
[43:46] crossover where the early majority
[43:48] slowly comes in and the early majority
[43:50] needs the infrastructure and the
[43:51] institutions uh to kind of gather the
[43:54] infrastructure. and actually make it
[43:56] happen. I'm I don't I'm speak just
[43:58] speaking out loud here. I don't know if
[44:00] it makes sense. I understand what you're
[44:02] what you're trying to say, but u I think
[44:05] that you know those hardcore Bitcoiners
[44:07] are still coming into the space. So
[44:09] there's there's still going to be the
[44:10] folks like us that are going to get
[44:12] super passionate about it because
[44:13] Bitcoin has that effects. And you know,
[44:16] especially
[44:17] people, you know, people between our
[44:20] age, I guess, uh, you know, can really
[44:22] see the problems of the old financial
[44:24] system once they see things like
[44:26] lightning payments, uh, and how much
[44:28] better it is and the the threats of
[44:30] third party ownership. I think there's
[44:32] always going to be those types of people
[44:33] that want to own their own Bitcoin. And
[44:35] I think it's a lot easier than say
[44:36] owning your old gold. So, it's I think
[44:40] it will be sort of like that. There'll
[44:41] be like a there'll be like a a niche
[44:43] group that always wants to hold their
[44:45] own Bitcoin and you know unless there's
[44:47] some sort of regulation where they try
[44:49] to make it illegal to do that which I
[44:51] think will
[44:52] be sought with a lot of backlash if that
[44:55] happens but you know I think it's all
[44:57] inevitable that big institution big
[44:59] banks adopt it nation states adopt it uh
[45:02] it's just impossible to avoid and one of
[45:04] the great things about the future is
[45:06] that nobody can predict it precisely and
[45:07] it's usually even more exciting than
[45:09] when we than what we envisioned. Right?
[45:11] Cuz like I wasn't in the cryptography
[45:13] circles before Bitcoin. I had no idea
[45:15] something like this was going to come
[45:16] along one day, but I'm sure a lot of
[45:17] people in that space knew one day, you
[45:19] know, internet money was going to come
[45:21] around and and take over and change
[45:22] humanity forever, right? So, uh I think,
[45:26] you know, it's going to be both. I think
[45:28] it's going to be both. More money is
[45:29] obviously going to come from the bigger
[45:31] entities, nations, and corporations, but
[45:33] there's always going to be a large group
[45:35] of retail people that are going to uh
[45:38] continue to, you know, acquire Bitcoin,
[45:41] hold their own keys, and want to
[45:43] interact with it on a on a peer-to-peer
[45:45] basis. So, I think you're going to see
[45:46] everything. You're going to see
[45:47] everything happen to Bitcoin, uh, and
[45:49] adopted by everybody. Uh but yeah, and
[45:51] it's going to be rolled out maybe from
[45:53] the big players uh down to the people
[45:55] that don't adopt it themselves kind of
[45:57] like uh you know, you don't adopt it.
[45:59] It's just kind of forced into your life
[46:01] whether it's in now in your part of your
[46:02] pension plan or whatever whatever aspect
[46:04] it might be. Um you know these things
[46:07] will be you know it's unfortunate
[46:09] because those people will get taken more
[46:10] advantage of right they'll pay the
[46:11] higher fees they'll pay the management
[46:13] fees uh and and they'll skim a little
[46:16] bit of your money off of you. Whereas
[46:17] you learn how to do it yourself, you
[46:18] know, you can keep more of your Bitcoin
[46:20] over time. Absolutely. Are you actually
[46:24] um totally fine if you if you don't want
[46:26] to go into the topic, you can cut it
[46:28] out, but are you all in in Bitcoin? Are
[46:30] you did you do this this whole stacking
[46:34] with the maximum exposure to Bitcoin?
[46:37] And did you use now a different strategy
[46:41] since you dropped your main job? I'm
[46:43] really interested on and like how you do
[46:45] did it methodically.
[46:47] Yeah. Well, to be for full disclosure,
[46:50] my my net worth is about 50% Bitcoin. Uh
[46:53] because like I said, I do have I did get
[46:55] into a little bit of real estate before
[46:57] uh I really took uh went down the
[46:59] Bitcoin rabbit hole. Uh and ever since
[47:01] then, which was like, you know, mid mid
[47:03] to late 2017, uh I've just I'd always
[47:06] been buying Bitcoin. Now I'm at a
[47:09] totally different uh stage of my life
[47:10] where I'm actually going to be uh
[47:12] starting to sell Bitcoin to live as
[47:15] slowly as possible. And you know, I
[47:18] still have a little bit of Bitcoin
[47:20] income. Uh you know, with Bitcoin well,
[47:23] but uh yeah, my strategy is not I'm not
[47:26] really stacking a whole lot anymore. Uh
[47:28] mostly just kind of maintaining what I
[47:30] have. I haven't really had to sell any
[47:31] at this point yet, but uh I'm about 50%
[47:35] in in Bitcoin. might go higher as as
[47:37] things change for me now. You know, it's
[47:39] going to be harder for me if I have to
[47:40] get reapproval for mortgages. So, maybe
[47:42] I'll sell a condo, maybe I'll put more
[47:43] into Bitcoin. My strategy is definitely
[47:45] going to change over the next couple of
[47:46] years, but right now I'm about 50% uh in
[47:49] in the fiat world or real estate and uh
[47:52] um 50% in Bitcoin. So, uh you know,
[47:55] maybe maybe that doesn't make me as as
[47:58] hardcore as a Bitcoiner because I
[48:00] haven't sold everything I I absolutely
[48:02] own and and put it into Bitcoin. you
[48:03] know, I still I I I'm a believer that
[48:05] concentration uh definitely builds
[48:07] wealth, but uh diversity, as they say,
[48:10] protects it. So, I'm trying to trying to
[48:12] protect myself uh for a long time to
[48:14] come and, you know, hopefully be self-
[48:16] sustainable forever here. And, you know,
[48:18] but but interestingly though, my Bitcoin
[48:21] stack keeps increasing in that
[48:23] percentage, right? Same thing is if you
[48:26] own like your cryp if you have a crypto
[48:28] portfolio uh you know if you know and
[48:30] you hold it those coins for you know
[48:32] longer than four years usually see your
[48:34] Bitcoin percentage continue to rise
[48:36] because most most of the altcoins trend
[48:38] to zero uh when priced in Bitcoin right
[48:41] so that's that's happening I think
[48:43] that's going to continue to happen and I
[48:44] wouldn't surprise me by the end of this
[48:46] year if my uh net worth is more than a
[48:49] lot more than 50% maybe 60 70 uh 75%
[48:54] because of uh price appreciation, right?
[48:56] Bitcoin goes a lot uh appreciates a lot
[48:58] higher in terms of percentage than real
[49:00] estate.
[49:03] It's a superpower when you all of a
[49:05] sudden calculate your net worth into
[49:08] Bitcoin and you are uh seeing all your
[49:11] investments uh in Bitcoin and uh
[49:16] it's for for me it's always because I I
[49:18] wanted to go into real estate actually
[49:20] in 2020 uh and didn't do it because I
[49:22] wanted to focus then on on Bitcoin. So I
[49:24] never went into anything with real
[49:26] estate. Um and now in in hindsight I'm
[49:29] I'm I'm quite happy about that. Uh but
[49:32] for you it's different because you
[49:33] already had uh those those investments
[49:36] uh and uh you also have income from
[49:38] that. So uh it makes sense and 50% is
[49:42] um not from my eye but for most eyes
[49:46] still very aggressive into
[49:48] Bitcoin. Yeah, for sure. Definitely.
[49:51] Like there's no, you know, uh you don't
[49:53] see a lot of older guys putting, you
[49:55] know, having 50% of their net worth. And
[49:57] if I'd ever tell my family members of
[49:59] like the appreciation I've got, you
[50:01] know, the their old mind sometimes just
[50:03] initially just says sell it, sell it
[50:04] right away, you know, and diversify, put
[50:07] it in something else, right? But, you
[50:09] know, if you want to keep taking those
[50:11] risk, man, you got to you got to leave
[50:12] it in there, man. Because once you
[50:13] understand Bitcoin, it's it's less
[50:15] risky, right? And you know, that stack
[50:17] compounds, you know, once it gets bigger
[50:20] a bigger amount, that compound means a
[50:22] lot more money. And you know, it doesn't
[50:24] take a lot of money to live out here,
[50:25] man. And freedom to me has always been
[50:28] super important, man. And out here, I
[50:29] got my freedom. Not working in a
[50:31] traditional 9 to5 right now. So, uh
[50:33] living much better uh in terms of life
[50:35] quality out here minus um burning
[50:38] season. I don't know if Jimmy talked
[50:40] about burning season, but uh in
[50:41] Thailand, uh burning season is right
[50:44] now. And so, the air quality is quite
[50:46] bad. Uh but something just I learned um
[50:49] recently. So, I'm actually curious to
[50:51] see what kind of initiatives, if any,
[50:53] are being uh talked about in terms of
[50:56] tackling that is major issue, right? Cuz
[50:58] it's not ideal to to stay somewhere
[51:00] forever if you know they're going to if
[51:03] it's bad air quality or bad for your
[51:04] health, right? So, but there's many
[51:06] places in Thailand uh that, you know,
[51:08] say Jimmy's checking out, he's going to
[51:09] kind of, you know, doing the rounds,
[51:11] seeing where the best places to go if
[51:13] you if you're looking to escape that.
[51:14] Um, you know, April April's been the
[51:17] worst month here for for burning season,
[51:19] but um, yeah, I'm sure I kind of went
[51:23] off on a tangent there on on on about
[51:25] that, but hope that answers your
[51:26] question. It it it's one thing that
[51:29] actually keeps me in Austria because the
[51:32] air quality is amazing. It's it's
[51:35] literally on the there's like an air
[51:37] pollution indicator and and uh Austria
[51:40] is always on the very low end because we
[51:43] have a lot of mountains, a lot of lakes,
[51:45] a lot of land and not a lot of people
[51:47] and not a lot of industry here. So the
[51:51] yeah is quite good here. And then uh the
[51:56] food here is is really good. Uh we have
[51:58] really hard rules. That's maybe one of
[52:02] the only one of the few good things
[52:06] about hard regulations and a lot of
[52:10] regulations. It's hard to get bad food
[52:13] into Europe uh and distributed in the
[52:16] supermarkets is actually something I
[52:18] talked with um and Bitcoiner I met in El
[52:20] Salvador. who was American uh and is
[52:24] really deep into the health uh scene and
[52:26] he's he's now like almost 80 years old
[52:28] and and he he talks about how how bad
[52:32] the food in America actually is and how
[52:35] good it is in Europe and how hard the
[52:38] regulations are. Things that are
[52:41] completely banned in in Europe that you
[52:43] can do with farming that are just bad
[52:45] for for the food and for the growings
[52:47] there is completely normal in America.
[52:50] and he pointed so many things out. Uh,
[52:53] and this is one thing that I actually
[52:55] really enjoy in Austria, the the living
[52:57] quality, but you pay a price with taxes.
[53:01] You pay a price with regulations. You
[53:04] pay a price with uh weird government.
[53:07] So, I'm I'm just I'm just young and
[53:09] hopeful that this will change and I'm
[53:11] trying to cast my vote and and make
[53:13] advertisements for that kind of a
[53:15] future. If it doesn't uh uh go in that
[53:18] direction, I'm gone. I'm I'm not
[53:21] emotionally b bonded. Uh I'm not in a
[53:24] bondage club uh club with with Austria.
[53:26] I can leave whenever I want. I I my I
[53:29] have no income from from Austria. I'm
[53:31] just living here. So it's it doesn't
[53:34] make sense for me to stay if u the
[53:36] regulations are so bad. Right. Right. Uh
[53:39] so so you're you're concerned about the
[53:41] some of the Austrian regulation? I'm
[53:44] concerned about socialists taking over,
[53:48] companies leaving, jobs leaving and the
[53:52] wealth that we accumulated in Austria
[53:55] leaving and
[53:57] therefore Europe looking like Venezuela
[54:00] in in 10 20 years and there's a point at
[54:04] some point where you have to leave in
[54:06] Venezuela when you have seen the story
[54:09] onethird of the whole country left and
[54:11] this was not the one the worst one/ird
[54:14] of the country. This was the best
[54:15] one-third of the country. And we see a
[54:17] little bit of the same thing happening
[54:19] in
[54:20] Europe. So, I'm just hopeful that we're
[54:24] not going down that direction, but going
[54:27] down a better direction, but that's
[54:29] wishful thinking. Uh I'm I'm waiting to
[54:32] see results and and and and see see
[54:34] where we end up because I really love
[54:36] Austria. I would love to be on the
[54:37] podcast and say, "Hey, all come to
[54:39] Austria. It's it's perfect. It's
[54:40] Austrian economics, home of Austria."
[54:42] like a Bitcoin capital of the world, but
[54:45] it is not like that unfortunately.
[54:48] Right. Right. Yeah. And I think I mean
[54:50] to me um Yeah. You have to strike a
[54:53] balance like you know you talk about
[54:56] the you know the regulations that keep
[54:59] your food healthy, right? You know a lot
[55:01] of a lot of conservatives will scream,
[55:03] you know, cut regulation, cut
[55:04] regulation, cut regulation. But some of
[55:06] those regulations are good for you. Uh
[55:08] whether you whe whether you know it or
[55:10] not. um you know a lot of people don't
[55:12] study public policy right so uh I think
[55:16] I I really think there needs to be a a
[55:18] balance uh between a free market and
[55:21] democratic socialist policies because
[55:23] Canada is a lot more like a democratic
[55:26] socialist country like some of the
[55:28] European nations whereas we see in
[55:30] America is kind of going the other way
[55:32] right now cutting absolutely everything
[55:33] in the government uh everything that
[55:35] they can uh but you know who you know
[55:38] some of those some of those will be good
[55:39] some of those will be that I'm sure. Uh,
[55:41] but I really think balance is key when
[55:43] it comes to to managing government. I
[55:45] don't think it should be total anarchy
[55:47] with no laws. I really think big
[55:48] corporations do do need to be regulated
[55:50] because they many many of them act uh
[55:54] unethically. Uh so that's kind of one
[55:57] thing where when you're out in Asia
[55:58] where all these countries are socialist
[56:00] like it's you know socialist republic of
[56:02] Vietnam and Thailand's more socialist.
[56:05] China's pure communist like you're
[56:07] getting a lot different values out here
[56:09] than if you say you move to America or
[56:12] El Salvador right now and the type of
[56:14] people that are um you know type of
[56:17] people that are going there I guess. How
[56:20] do you think Bitcoin will impact public
[56:22] policy, governments, nation states on in
[56:24] in the long term? Yeah. Uh I think like
[56:27] I said earlier like it's going to be
[56:28] forced people are going to be forced to
[56:30] adopt Bitcoin in every way they can and
[56:32] the ones that do it quicker uh are going
[56:34] to be in in the best spot.
[56:37] So yeah, it's a very tough question.
[56:40] There's, you know, how many countries in
[56:42] the world and they're all going to
[56:43] they're all going to approach it
[56:44] differently. It's going to be tough for
[56:45] places like China where they like to
[56:46] have tight control on these types of
[56:48] things where Bitcoin offers that what
[56:50] like Swiss bank account in your pocket
[56:51] sort of sort of vibe, right? So, uh how
[56:55] it's going to shape. Yeah, they're their
[56:57] hands are going to be forced in many
[56:58] ways. I do believe uh just not sure how
[57:01] long each country will resist, but I
[57:04] think uh they're going to have to
[57:06] respect uh public um self- custody.
[57:09] They're going to have to respect that, I
[57:10] think, because there's really no getting
[57:12] around it. And you know, they're going
[57:14] to have to they're going to have to
[57:16] stack Bitcoin. They're going to have to
[57:18] probably create help create
[57:20] infrastructure for for Bitcoin. They're
[57:23] going to have to help create education
[57:24] programs. Um, as much as Bitcoiners like
[57:27] to do this stuff for free, uh, you know,
[57:30] doing it on a major level um, with major
[57:33] organization is going to push the going
[57:35] to push our cause forward a lot a lot
[57:37] further. Uh, but yeah, it's it's it's a
[57:39] loaded question. We have a federal
[57:41] election happening in Canada April 28th
[57:44] where we have uh Pierre Polyv who's been
[57:48] um you know touted by the Bitcoin
[57:50] community. I'm not sure if you've seen
[57:52] him uh but he is our conservative uh
[57:54] lead uh leader of the opposition party
[57:57] which is now uh Mark Carney is our prime
[57:59] minister. Uh Justin Trudeau had stepped
[58:01] down a few weeks ago. So now we since
[58:04] the Trudeau uh has stepped down now
[58:07] we've seen a surge in liberal popularity
[58:09] again. So now we're kind of seeing more
[58:11] of a neck andneck where before we were
[58:13] really predicting this uh Pierre Palv uh
[58:16] conservative guy to be our prime
[58:18] minister. Now uh April 28th we're going
[58:20] to see uh whether the Liberals are going
[58:21] to maintain power or we're going to see
[58:23] that conservative government come in. Uh
[58:25] I'm not too sure about um any regulation
[58:29] changes. Nobody really seems to seem uh
[58:31] sure about Pier Polyv in his Bitcoin
[58:34] policy stance. He said things about
[58:35] making crypto and blockchain would make
[58:37] us the capital of the world. hasn't seen
[58:39] too much about it, but there was uh
[58:41] there was
[58:42] um you know an event where he went and
[58:46] paid and bought uh a schwarma in Bitcoin
[58:49] uh a couple years ago. Uh so we're going
[58:51] to see what happens in Canada. I imagine
[58:53] we're going to follow much of what the
[58:54] states do is usually what we do when
[58:56] these types of things and you know big
[58:58] financial decisions for the most part it
[59:00] seems like. Uh but yeah, I'm hoping
[59:02] we'll we'll be we'll be friendly. Uh
[59:04] have some Bitcoin friendly policy in
[59:06] Canada coming as well. Uh yeah, each
[59:08] country is going to each country is
[59:10] going to tackle this this issue a little
[59:11] bit differently. I think
[59:14] it's it's a is a really valuable insight
[59:18] and I think a lot of people don't have
[59:21] that perspective of we still have we
[59:26] still have nation states that don't have
[59:28] electricity. We do still have places
[59:30] where there's no electricity, no
[59:32] internet, no Bitcoin, nothing like that.
[59:35] when we look in those places obviously
[59:38] they lack behind but what do we have
[59:40] electricity I think electricity or was
[59:43] it internet uh one of those things it
[59:46] was just a 60% of the adoption rate I
[59:48] think it was the internet we just had
[59:50] 60% of the adoption in the internet so
[59:52] different places will have different
[59:55] rate of speeds of the adoption and they
[59:58] will benefit in a different way so maybe
[60:01] North Korea will have a very very low
[60:06] uh embracement of Bitcoin. But then on
[60:10] the other side, maybe America, Thailand,
[60:13] El Salvador, other small places like
[60:16] Budon, hopefully Austria, visual
[60:19] thinking um will have a way higher
[60:23] adoption rate than than other states,
[60:25] other countries, other places in the
[60:27] world. And those countries who actually
[60:30] get it will be the leaders of of the
[60:33] free world. And those who don't get it
[60:36] and lack behind and fight against it,
[60:38] those who lack behind and and don't have
[60:41] the the gun in the fist fight from from
[60:43] from earlier. I I I do see that coming.
[60:47] Also, I heard Pierre will come on Joe
[60:50] Rogan. So, if this comes out, maybe he
[60:52] was already on there. Uh that that that
[60:54] would be really cool uh to to see. I I I
[60:58] I never watched anything of Donald
[61:00] Trump, but when he was on Joe Rogan, I
[61:02] watched him. So I I I I like those see
[61:05] those things. So your algorithm isn't
[61:08] just flooded with like Elon Musk and
[61:10] Donald Trump like mine is
[61:13] um on Twitter.
[61:16] Yes. Uh but uh now I I now I only see
[61:20] how uh le left people destroy Tesla
[61:24] stores. That's what Mile Groom currently
[61:26] gives me. Uh yeah. Yeah. Many people are
[61:29] uh uh backlashing to Elon Musk and what
[61:31] he's doing in America right now. And
[61:33] actually about a half hour away from
[61:35] home for me in Canada. Uh the one in
[61:38] Hamilton, Ontario, big Tesla dealership
[61:40] was uh vandalized and I think a bunch of
[61:42] cars were were set on fire or something
[61:45] like that. But yeah, it's it's happening
[61:47] a lot, man. People aren't really happy
[61:49] with a lot of people aren't happy with
[61:50] what he's doing. Some people are happy
[61:52] with what he's doing. It's just it's
[61:53] just so polarized right now, right? Like
[61:55] it's probably not it's probably a little
[61:57] bit polarized everywhere in a lot of
[61:58] Western nations right now. We have it in
[62:00] Canada, but America is like the epitome
[62:02] of like I don't know feels like late
[62:06] capitalism, you know, friction between
[62:09] classes and uh just super super
[62:12] polarized where people are believing one
[62:14] thing and the other group of people is
[62:15] believing the complete opposite and
[62:17] there's just no cohesion happening right
[62:19] now. It's it's a little bit scary to see
[62:20] to be honest with you.
[62:22] What's your thoughts on on Trump and
[62:24] Elon Musk and uh their quite radical and
[62:28] aggressive steps towards uh cutting
[62:30] government spendings? Yeah, so I'm kind
[62:32] of an outlier in the Bitcoin space. I
[62:34] think when it comes to that because I
[62:35] don't like these guys. Uh I don't I
[62:37] don't think I think Bitcoin's inevitable
[62:39] whether Donald Trump is the
[62:40] administration to adopt it or not. It's
[62:42] going to happen one way or another. And
[62:43] a lot of things that they are doing I
[62:45] don't agree with. Uh I think you know uh
[62:48] a lot of the things that Elon Musk says
[62:51] uh is misinformation and even if you put
[62:53] it in Grock if you say give me one name
[62:55] I don't know if you saw that going
[62:56] around but if you put in Grock give me
[62:58] the person who spreads the most
[62:59] misinformation give me one name only
[63:01] Elon Musk comes up. So, I mean, I I
[63:05] think it's uh undeniable that he does
[63:07] spread a lot of m misinformation and
[63:09] calls a lot of things fraud that that
[63:11] maybe aren't fraud or and then he does
[63:12] he does do a lot of things where then he
[63:14] reverses decisions whether it be with
[63:16] Twitter or or government things he said.
[63:18] I've seen that he's given a
[63:20] million-dollar checks for people that
[63:22] vote a certain way in Wisconsin. I think
[63:24] he won the legal battle, but I'm pretty
[63:25] sure that was uh some that's an illegal
[63:27] maneuver in elections uh and can be seen
[63:30] as election fraud. Uh so I don't know a
[63:33] lot a lot of things I don't think he's
[63:34] they're doing are unde undemocratic the
[63:37] the going after the one of the judges
[63:40] right now that ruled against uh one of
[63:42] their uh executive orders or one of
[63:44] their decisions down there. So now
[63:46] they're attacking this judge calling him
[63:47] an activist judge. So um yeah I just
[63:51] don't I just don't agree with a lot of
[63:52] what they're doing. Obviously, uh,
[63:54] Bitcoin, on the Bitcoin front, I agree
[63:56] with, you know, making a strategic
[63:58] reserve and not everything they do is
[64:00] bad and a lot of things are good, but I
[64:02] think there's a lot of mistakes that
[64:03] they're making or I just philosophically
[64:05] don't don't agree with what they're
[64:06] doing. Again, I'm from Canada, so we're
[64:08] a little bit more democratic socialist
[64:11] uh than than our neighbors down south.
[64:13] And there's actually a lot of friction
[64:14] between Canada and US right now with all
[64:17] the tariffs happening. Uh, and actually
[64:19] I think I just saw one a Rand Paul bill
[64:22] was just passed in the Senate or or um
[64:25] it was a stoppage to for Canadian
[64:27] tariffs. So, uh, people I think people
[64:29] and a lot of Americans that uh have
[64:32] family in Canada or have friends in
[64:33] Canada are starting to realize
[64:35] like the way that Donald Trump speaks
[64:38] about Canada is is kind of scary. Like
[64:40] we've always been neighbors, we're
[64:42] friends. how a couple years ago we we
[64:45] arrested the CFO or whatever of Huawei,
[64:48] the Chinese company, put our whole
[64:50] reputation and relationship with China,
[64:52] you know, the emerging superpower of the
[64:53] world for for America. And you know,
[64:56] here they are a couple years later
[64:57] stabbing us in the back, putting tariffs
[64:59] on all all our goods. Uh and you know,
[65:02] we've been we've been friends for so
[65:03] long now we're seeing uh travel in the
[65:05] States drop tremendously. uh you know,
[65:08] we've taken, you know, our our premier
[65:10] of Ontario has taken all American booze
[65:13] off the shelves. Like they didn't even
[65:14] want to sell sell what they had. Like
[65:17] like the friction is is high. And I mean
[65:19] there was a there was a big hockey game
[65:20] not too long ago where Canada and US
[65:22] were were battling it out uh in the
[65:25] tournament there and Canada came out and
[65:27] and won that. So we were pretty happy
[65:28] about that. And like another thing too
[65:31] is like the American the American anthem
[65:32] is being booed heavily like when when it
[65:35] gets played in Canada. like we've never
[65:37] seen this before. You know, relations
[65:38] have always been pretty good. I live
[65:40] like, you know, 20 30 minutes from the
[65:42] Buffalo border uh in America. Um it's
[65:45] crazy. It's really crazy to see what's
[65:46] happening over there. Uh but overall, I
[65:49] don't really agree with a lot of what
[65:51] they're doing. Uh obviously on the
[65:52] Bitcoin front, uh even even the Bitcoin
[65:54] front, like there's a lot of crypto,
[65:56] like what's with the Trump coin? What's
[65:57] with all these meme coins coming out? Uh
[65:59] that doesn't seem like a Bitcoin
[66:01] positive thing in this space. Uh, so I
[66:03] mean I' I prefer I prefer to, you know,
[66:07] uh, wait and get something get some
[66:10] other sort of, uh, person in there
[66:11] that's not going to, you know, do all
[66:13] the bad things that come with the good.
[66:15] But it's all subjective at the end of
[66:17] the day, I guess. Uh, but those those
[66:19] are my opinions. So, I'm a little bit of
[66:20] an outlier when it comes to that to me
[66:23] in the Bitcoin maxi space. Anyways,
[66:26] did you prefer what uh what Biden uh
[66:30] represented? Yeah, I
[66:33] mean, no. I mean, not necessarily, but
[66:36] Bitcoin still did grow under under the
[66:38] Biden administration under a liberal
[66:40] government. It's going to grow
[66:41] regardless. It's going to be adopted
[66:43] regardless. Uh, obviously, Bitcoin
[66:45] friendly policies are going to progress
[66:48] it a lot quicker. Uh, and I I don't
[66:50] really I can't really say that I know
[66:52] the whole position. I know like
[66:54] Elizabeth Warren was like worried about,
[66:56] you know, a lot of different things uh
[66:58] with Bitcoin. I didn't see Bernie
[67:00] Sanders say anything about Bitcoin. Uh
[67:02] there's but it's always it's always a
[67:05] conservative government that kind of
[67:06] adopts Bitcoin first. It seems like uh
[67:09] because of the the libertarian aspects
[67:11] of Bitcoin and the freedom that it gives
[67:12] you. But I do think at the end of the
[67:14] day, it's just a tool and just like the
[67:16] internet and it can be used for no
[67:17] matter what kind of ideology you have,
[67:19] it's going to be a great tool for you no
[67:20] matter what. So regardless of what kind
[67:23] of government is in power, Bitcoin is
[67:25] the Bitcoin is the answer. And uh not
[67:28] necessarily saying I love the Biden
[67:30] administration and what they were doing
[67:31] with Bitcoin. I don't agree with that
[67:33] either. Uh but also they weren't doing a
[67:36] lot of things that uh that the Trump
[67:38] administration is doing. So it's hard to
[67:40] throw all your values for Bitcoin.
[67:41] Obviously it's a big big big thing that
[67:43] it's going to progress the world a lot,
[67:45] but it's hard to you know throw
[67:46] absolutely
[67:47] every ideology or or opinion you have on
[67:51] every other subject just to progress
[67:52] Bitcoin a little bit during this cycle,
[67:54] right? Uh, so yeah, I'm not sure. What
[67:56] do you What do you think about that,
[67:58] Robin? It's super interesting because we
[68:01] had under Biden a more hostile
[68:04] environment against
[68:06] crypto, which could be actually good for
[68:09] Bitcoin. Like, don't get me wrong, I I
[68:12] think what Trump uh and the Trump
[68:15] administration is doing is is net
[68:18] positive for Bitcoin if you just look at
[68:20] Bitcoin. but going really hostile
[68:22] against crypto and making uh cases with
[68:26] the SEC against uh all those big
[68:30] cryptocasinos and and and crypto
[68:33] holes. That might just be a good thing
[68:36] for Bitcoin because we know Bitcoin is
[68:38] antifragile and they cannot touch it.
[68:40] And the SEC also declared Bitcoin as
[68:42] something different. Uh and the CFDC
[68:46] also declared Bitcoin as something
[68:47] different.
[68:49] So, I think for Bitcoin it wouldn't
[68:54] matter that much. It's just interesting
[68:58] how
[69:00] um and it it speaks to Bitcoin. Like I
[69:03] had people I had people on the show on
[69:06] on on on both sides that uh loved uh
[69:10] loved Biden Harris. It's actually just
[69:13] like one two persons maybe or three
[69:15] persons. is a little bit less uh um uh
[69:18] populate than there are some that are
[69:20] just neutral to it. It's probably the
[69:21] biggest part like probably 80% of of my
[69:25] guests or 90% of the guests are neutral
[69:28] to it. They they don't really care about
[69:29] Trump. They don't really care about
[69:30] that. If the election got a little bit
[69:32] more political, I have to say and there
[69:35] are people say, "Oh, that election was
[69:37] the most important election ever. If
[69:40] that wouldn't have won by Trump, we
[69:42] would have gone to communism in in four
[69:45] years, maybe. I don't know. I I'm an
[69:47] Austrian. I'm Europe. I I really don't
[69:49] know that much about uh um American
[69:52] politics. I I also only get American
[69:55] politics
[69:57] through the people here uh that that
[69:59] speak about uh uh Bitcoin and politics
[70:02] in America. So, I have a very narrow
[70:04] view on it. and and right now I don't
[70:06] care to to dig deep in American politics
[70:09] because I don't even vote so it's I I
[70:12] don't live there. Um I have a lot of
[70:14] opinions on on Austria and Europe. Uh
[70:17] but it's not as interesting because like
[70:18] just 1% of my viewership is is from uh
[70:21] from from Austria, not even
[70:23] 1%. So at the end of the day um Bitcoin
[70:29] will not and does not care. But I think
[70:33] it's also net positive for America to
[70:36] establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve to
[70:38] bring Bitcoin mining back in the country
[70:41] and to start buying Bitcoin rather soon.
[70:44] They they haven't done yet but they they
[70:46] probably will and which is also almost
[70:49] more importantly that the states not the
[70:52] federal level the states of America is
[70:54] also going more and more into Bitcoin. I
[70:57] think that's the that that's the
[70:59] important message for me that America is
[71:02] doing those important steps. What Il
[71:05] Musk is doing with Doge? Honestly, I
[71:06] have no clue. I don't I don't know. I I
[71:10] like the idea of cutting government
[71:11] spending, but you can also do it the
[71:13] wrong way. Uh I don't know if it he's
[71:15] doing it the right way or the wrong way.
[71:17] I just know I'm a fan of smaller
[71:19] governments than bigger governments in
[71:21] general. Uh so yeah, kind of neutral on
[71:24] that one.
[71:26] Yeah. I Yeah. I just I just have a
[71:29] problem when you're when you're saying
[71:31] thing something if something's fraud,
[71:33] that's great. Say it out and let's let's
[71:35] prosecute whoever's committing fraud.
[71:36] But if you're, you know, saying things
[71:38] that aren't true, uh like people
[71:41] getting, oh, all these people, fake
[71:42] people are getting security checks. And
[71:44] like if that's not proven, now you're
[71:46] further radicalizing people. You're
[71:47] saying, "Oh, well, the other side's so
[71:49] corrupt. Look at what they're doing."
[71:50] And then it comes out like, "Oh, no. No
[71:52] one's actually receiving no one's
[71:54] actually receiving these checks that you
[71:55] claim. No one's 120 30 years old
[71:58] receiving these and it's just a
[71:59] computing error or something like that.
[72:00] So, but when you say something like that
[72:02] tound whatever how many million
[72:04] followers Elon Musk has now and how many
[72:08] people get radicalized every time they
[72:09] read something like that because they
[72:11] don't have they're just a plumber or
[72:12] they're just an electrician or a regular
[72:14] working person uh that doesn't have time
[72:17] to read into all these different
[72:18] different things, right? they just see
[72:20] headlines and then they make their form
[72:21] their opinion, right? So, I just I just
[72:23] don't like the the misinformation that's
[72:25] uh often being spread by by that camp. U
[72:29] you know, obviously they'll come out and
[72:30] say I'm a Democratic or a Camala Harris
[72:32] fan, which is not true either. Uh you
[72:35] know, uh you know, I like to say issue
[72:37] by issue, and I just think, you know,
[72:39] should try to pick the lesser of the
[72:40] evils. you know, no no government's
[72:41] really perfect at at uh every every
[72:44] policy and every issue, but uh just keep
[72:47] That's good though that a lot of people
[72:48] are apolitical that come on your show,
[72:50] though, and they're just trying to push
[72:51] the Bitcoin gospel because that's the
[72:53] most important thing and it's going to
[72:54] be inevitable for no matter what
[72:55] government. We've kind of all predicted
[72:57] that this is going to happen. All
[72:58] Bitcoiners kind of knew that this was
[73:00] going to happen. Uh after being in the
[73:02] space for a while, you're just like,
[73:03] "Wow, this is really, you know, an
[73:04] immutable blockchain. Uh it's you can't
[73:07] do any you can't touch it, right?" I
[73:09] like the term you use actually,
[73:10] anti-fragile. I haven't heard that in a
[73:12] while and it's that's definitely going
[73:13] to stick with me after the podcast.
[73:15] Anti-fragile. I really love that term
[73:16] for Bitcoin.
[73:19] Uh I don't know who's coined that, but
[73:22] many people uh in in in in Bitcoin use
[73:25] it. Um but yeah, it's also I'm currently
[73:28] writing a book and it's it's kind of
[73:30] hard because I'm using a lot of things
[73:32] from other people, but I don't remember
[73:34] from whom I learned it. So I probably
[73:37] will just write a big disclaimer in the
[73:39] start of
[73:40] like everything you will see in the next
[73:43] pages is copied from someone else.
[73:46] Please don't be don't be don't be mad at
[73:49] me. Uh I I I because I have 500 guests
[73:51] and I've learned many things from from
[73:53] them but I don't remember exactly where
[73:56] the this thought came from. Well all
[73:59] thoughts all thoughts in your head
[74:01] originated from somewhere somewhere. So,
[74:03] you know, depending on how you look at
[74:04] it, everything could be seen as
[74:05] plagiarism. You're you're just with 500
[74:08] guests, that's that's crazy, man. So,
[74:10] there's no way you're ever going to
[74:11] remember who said what. But, you know,
[74:13] you can say big thanks to everybody
[74:15] who's come on and educated me. Uh, you
[74:17] know, you can even list their names.
[74:19] That would that would maybe take up a
[74:20] page or two, right? So, uh, so that's
[74:22] awesome, man. You're working. That's a
[74:24] that's an interesting idea. I might do
[74:26] that of like ju just just like a list of
[74:30] names of all the guests. I mean, it
[74:32] would be one hack of a work to work all
[74:34] the names out because I don't have an
[74:35] extra sheet. Like everything is in my
[74:37] head.
[74:39] Yeah, a lot of things in my head, too.
[74:41] Uh, but yeah, if you can become
[74:42] organized or can create a list. Hey,
[74:44] maybe maybe some people will just buy
[74:45] the book just because they want to see
[74:47] their name in the book, right? Yeah,
[74:49] that's that's awesome. And what can you
[74:50] tell me about your book? Are is it going
[74:52] to be a long-term uh long work in
[74:54] progress or are we expecting it soon? Do
[74:56] you have a title?
[74:58] It is something I'm not even sure if I
[75:00] release it. Uh, I learned so much from
[75:03] the podcast that I want to write it down
[75:06] and process it myself to just like
[75:09] conceptualize what do I actually have to
[75:11] learn from that podcast up until now.
[75:16] And if it turns out that I can put it in
[75:19] a format that is actually valuable for
[75:21] other people so that it's actually
[75:22] something other people would enjoy
[75:24] reading and get value from it or maybe
[75:26] even orange pill other people from that
[75:29] then I might rewrite it so that it's
[75:32] actually nice flow has an nice theory
[75:34] around it and has a nice packaging
[75:37] around that and and publish it. But
[75:39] maybe it's just staying with with me
[75:42] myself and and and I all the time. Uh
[75:45] there's also a middle way of that. Maybe
[75:48] I'm writing it, but I don't want to uh
[75:51] publish it professionally and I will
[75:53] just make like an PDF somewhere and and
[75:56] upload it and hey like hey if you're
[75:58] interested read it a PDF. There are so
[76:01] many tools where you can just put the
[76:03] PDF and make uh a speech by it. Maybe I
[76:07] also just make uh a video series on my
[76:10] podcast around like 10 parts and and go
[76:13] into the ideas uh and don't even publish
[76:15] a book just make a video podcast series
[76:18] around it. I don't know how I will
[76:20] package it. For me, it's more about what
[76:24] I have learned and uh what are kind of
[76:28] the consequences from that and what can
[76:31] other people take away from that?
[76:32] Because that's the question I get most
[76:35] when I get on other podcasts. They ask
[76:37] me, hey, like you interviewed 500
[76:39] people, what have you learned from that?
[76:40] And I'm like, where should I start? Uh
[76:43] so, uh and having like a main theory and
[76:46] having like thoughts around that, I
[76:48] think is very valuable for for me, but
[76:49] also for the Bitcoin community.
[76:52] Yeah, absolutely. I think it's a great
[76:53] exercise, too, to to self-reflect on
[76:55] these things. Uh, write write them down.
[76:57] It's a good, you know, journal for
[76:59] yourself, too, to reflect upon. I think
[77:01] that's really cool. Um, yeah. And I've
[77:04] had similar thoughts, too. I haven't
[77:05] started anything like that, but uh, you
[77:07] know, it's a it's a great it's a great
[77:09] way to and this is like doing the
[77:11] podcast is sort of like, you know,
[77:12] you're you know, you're you're taking a
[77:14] history. It's sort of it's like a video
[77:16] journal, right? and you can kind of
[77:17] think about how you felt during that
[77:19] during that time or it's sometimes good
[77:20] to to look back and oh I had a big
[77:22] interview with so and so. You've had
[77:24] some big people on your show now, have
[77:26] didn't you? You've had some uh Yeah,
[77:28] like uh Michael Sailor was on, Jeff Boof
[77:31] was now already on second time. Uh and
[77:35] uh yeah, like many many many many big
[77:38] names uh were on. There's some that I
[77:41] still want to get to like Czech Maras
[77:43] has hasn't replied to me. So, so far
[77:45] Linda is also really want to get to
[77:48] Cipher in a Moose. I I never wrote but I
[77:51] I DM'd or something like that. So, I I
[77:53] still have to do that. So, there there's
[77:55] some people that I really want to get
[77:57] to. Uh but I'm also not super focused on
[78:01] that. Um uh it's like uh the the the mo
[78:05] most most of the big ones actually were
[78:07] already on. Uh and my personal uh hero
[78:10] and and favorite uh in the beginning was
[78:13] Michael Sailor and Jeff Bof. And and I'm
[78:15] so glad that they were both were already
[78:17] on. Jeff M was already a second time on
[78:20] and Michael Sailor might also come a
[78:22] second time on actually this year. So
[78:25] I'm I'm I'm really really happy and with
[78:27] with the names uh the from like what
[78:32] which big names were on now I'm
[78:35] actually trying to figure out okay who
[78:37] are the Bitcoiners that I'll keep
[78:40] returning and who might be interesting
[78:43] as a new addition that touches Bitcoin
[78:45] but comes from another audience. So we
[78:48] have cross audience pollination so we
[78:51] can get Bitcoin out to other audiences
[78:53] more because if you think about you you
[78:56] follow a guy that talks about how to
[78:59] improve speech and and he's really
[79:01] popular and he's also a Bitcoiner but he
[79:03] mostly talks about how to improve your
[79:05] vocal things and stuff like that. He
[79:07] would be really interesting to have on a
[79:09] podcast and talk only about Bitcoin
[79:11] because there will be some people that
[79:13] only improve their speech with him and
[79:15] know him from that then like wait he's
[79:18] talking about Bitcoin that let me see
[79:19] that and then all of the sudden they get
[79:21] orange build with that. So that's the
[79:23] next step of the podcast for next year
[79:25] 1026. I'm I'm trying to start as the
[79:28] podcast grows of attracting people that
[79:32] have Bitcoin but don't really talk about
[79:34] it but are really popular within another
[79:37] niche completely different from from
[79:39] Bitcoin to
[79:41] have to get Bitcoin out there. I mean
[79:45] Peter McCormick actually does a really
[79:47] good job in that. Obviously, he's like
[79:49] 10 levels above me, but uh we need more
[79:53] of of of of that if you if you get what
[79:56] I mean. Yeah, definitely. Uh cross
[79:58] collaboration, it's a good um way to
[80:01] grow your audience for sure. Like, you
[80:03] know, maybe you have people, you know,
[80:06] in a different maybe it's martial arts,
[80:07] but now all of a sudden they're
[80:09] Bitcoiners as well. And like sometimes
[80:11] when you see people in your own
[80:12] community, maybe your your trainer your
[80:14] trainer in martial arts is now a
[80:16] Bitcoiner. So now someone that you trust
[80:18] in this aspect of your life now talking
[80:21] about something else. So that might
[80:22] spark your interest and now you're going
[80:24] to be interested in what this person is
[80:25] saying because you admire and you
[80:27] respect this person for what they do in
[80:29] a different category and now you're
[80:30] going to cross over from that audience.
[80:32] So that's that's a really good strategy.
[80:33] Maybe I might have to uh take uh your
[80:35] advice on that one and and look it's
[80:38] it's really good one. Yeah, I had uh
[80:40] Renato Moano uh and uh Kenny Florian on.
[80:44] So both are uh uh martial arts fighters,
[80:48] UFC fighters actually. So, uh, this was
[80:51] a lot of fun because I talked a lot
[80:53] about like sports and talking a lot
[80:56] about, um,
[80:58] how a lot of things not correlated with
[81:01] Bitcoin, but also like Bitcoin stuff.
[81:04] And these are the episodes I think that
[81:06] I, uh, will be really good for long-term
[81:09] Bitcoin orange pilling from podcast. And
[81:12] this is also I have seven episodes each
[81:14] week. So I can still have like four or
[81:17] five Bitcoin only, Bitcoin focused
[81:20] podcast and like have one, two that are
[81:22] still about Bitcoin but talking with a
[81:26] different perspective and a fresh mind
[81:28] if you so will.
[81:31] Definitely lots of room lots of room for
[81:32] that when you're doing them daily.
[81:34] Definitely. So that's that'll be
[81:36] interesting. I'll look out for some more
[81:38] unique conversations. Absolutely. Thank
[81:41] you so much. Uh on that topic, we have
[81:43] one question that I ask each and every
[81:44] one of my guests and the question is
[81:46] what can we learn from you besides
[81:48] Bitcoin? Yeah, that's um it's a good
[81:51] question and I think something that's
[81:54] been in my head lately. I don't think
[81:56] it's me, but it's a Gandhi quote I
[81:58] think, but uh live like you're going to
[82:01] die tomorrow and learn like you're going
[82:03] to live forever. And it kind of resonate
[82:05] resonates with me lately as uh quitting
[82:07] my job, coming out here and kind of
[82:09] making another big risk move uh you know
[82:13] I think adopt those strategies man
[82:15] because you're going to you only got so
[82:16] many spins around the sun. So live your
[82:19] life like it's your last and learn like
[82:21] you're going to live forever. Uh because
[82:24] you know every day that you acquire
[82:26] knowledge you know education is power
[82:28] and that's something that kind of sticks
[82:29] with me lately. So let's go with that
[82:31] one.
[82:32] I love that so so much. I like that. And
[82:36] we have Andrew in the podcast where the
[82:38] previous guest is asking a question for
[82:40] the next guest without knowing who the
[82:41] next guest actually is. It's an
[82:43] interesting one. Do you think it's a net
[82:46] positive or a ne net negative for
[82:50] Bitcoin that Black Rock is now involved?
[82:52] Uh it's one of those things that I say
[82:54] that's inevitable and I want to go back
[82:56] to the quote that everything is good for
[82:58] Bitcoin. So my answer is it's a net
[83:00] positive. uh everyone who's holding
[83:02] Bitcoin is going to see Bitcoin become
[83:04] much more scarce with Black Rockck
[83:05] acquiring so much of it. Uh I don't
[83:07] think they can really wield too much
[83:09] power by holding unless they were to
[83:10] somehow dump it all at once, which I
[83:12] don't think is really possible. So my
[83:14] answer to that is it's it's a net
[83:15] positive and something that's seen as
[83:17] inevitable. Absolutely. Really cool. Uh
[83:21] then before I let you go, where can
[83:23] people find you, ask you questions,
[83:24] reach out to you and and see more of
[83:26] your stuff? Yeah, you can follow my
[83:28] personal Twitter account uh Bradleybines
[83:31] or you can follow HavingRport on
[83:34] Twitterx on uh YouTube of course
