[00:00] the Fiat system encourages chaos we saw
[00:02] Bitcoin go from 4,000 to 70 which is
[00:05] about 17 1 12 times so we're sitting
[00:08] here at what 58k if we make it 60k for
[00:12] ease of num 175 times of that is a mil
[00:15] 15,000 they always say money rules the
[00:17] world I think beneath that is energy
[00:19] rules the world the US is pulling the
[00:21] monetary arm the bricks nations are
[00:22] pulling the energy arm at a certain
[00:24] point these things are going to collide
[00:25] Bitcoin could be a million dollars in
[00:27] this cycle and I truly believe that I
[00:29] see kind of like two paths to like
[00:30] hyperbitcoinization the first path is
[00:33] everything crashes and burns and then we
[00:35] basically have to rebuild it up the
[00:36] other path is we get presidents in there
[00:39] like Trump or like some of these others
[00:40] that would want to keep the strength in
[00:42] the dollar recognizing the true power of
[00:44] Bitcoin delaying that
[00:46] hyperbitcoinization we gives the
[00:47] builders time to build on the lightning
[00:49] Network and other things like that so we
[00:51] can get to that place the rich are going
[00:52] to get richer the poor are going to get
[00:54] poor and then the poor are basically
[00:56] going to Rebel retirement accounts I
[00:58] think Social Security all that stuff is
[01:00] is almost a sham here in the US I think
[01:02] everybody would come to the conclusion
[01:04] just buy Bitcoin and hold it bitcoiners
[01:06] kind of resonate like fix the money fix
[01:07] the world so much because of all the
[01:09] underlying issues and stresses and
[01:11] things like that that money causes I
[01:13] think uh you know Bitcoin can help fix a
[01:15] lot of those
[01:15] [Music]
[01:18] things your podcast is called Green
[01:21] candle podcast I love that love that
[01:23] name a lot uh the first obvious maybe
[01:26] fun question is when are we seeing the
[01:29] the a weighted green God candle that we
[01:31] all
[01:32] want yeah man it seems like it's like
[01:35] everything's kind of leading up to it so
[01:37] uh you know last time we we kind of had
[01:39] some you know issues with the interest
[01:43] rate market and everything in the US um
[01:46] you know was the covid crash and
[01:47] everything right we had basically
[01:49] inflated everything right in 2020 we saw
[01:53] Bitcoin Crash from you know uh 20K or so
[01:57] down to down to four and we saw it shoot
[01:59] back up all the way up to 70,000 you
[02:02] know why did we really see that well it
[02:05] was basically a bunch of QE quantitative
[02:07] easing and in that sense it was a bunch
[02:10] of money being dumped into the market
[02:12] another form of that is pulling back
[02:15] interest rates so we have interest rates
[02:17] at uh that Rose basically at an all-time
[02:20] Pace here recently and they've been
[02:22] staying very high um you know we're
[02:24] recording this in the 13th I think the
[02:25] FED is meeting in the next couple weeks
[02:27] and the the plan is for them to start
[02:29] pulling back the Reigns uh you know to
[02:31] start cutting interest rates so you know
[02:34] I I mean crystal ball here I'm not quite
[02:36] sure exactly when but I mean we saw
[02:39] essentially Bitcoin go from 4,000 to 70
[02:43] which is about 17 and a half times so
[02:46] we're sitting here at what 58k if we
[02:48] make it 60k for for uh ease of numbers
[02:51] 17 and a half times of that is a milon
[02:54] 50,000 so I mean if we see that amount
[02:58] of quantitative easing that we saw in
[03:00] during the covid crisis I think it's
[03:02] coming very soon because interest rates
[03:05] coming down and I think that you know
[03:07] there's a lot of turbulent Economic
[03:08] Times going on here I don't think the
[03:10] consumer's as strong as everybody says
[03:13] and I think you know um besides all that
[03:15] too like you know there's a lot of
[03:17] geopolitical tension too in the air so
[03:19] um you know the Fiat system encourages
[03:22] chaos right so uh in 2020 we had the
[03:26] covid pump and dump basically so this
[03:28] time it might be other geopolitical
[03:30] pressures but I think it's coming soon I
[03:33] think it's coming soon and uh I think
[03:35] that the money Printing and uh the money
[03:37] printer is going to start to go bur here
[03:39] pretty quick it's also interesting for
[03:41] me when when we look at like monetary
[03:44] policy in energy and and the war coming
[03:46] up like there's so many interesting uh
[03:49] macro factors that come into play and
[03:51] then kind of all intertwine to to each
[03:54] other do you see a connection between
[03:56] like uh monetary policy from a fi
[03:58] currency standpoint from Bitcoin and
[04:01] especially with with energy also like a
[04:02] lot of people say like Bitcoin is energy
[04:05] money yeah I mean 100% I mean I think
[04:07] everything is connected in the overall
[04:10] Economic Policy um you know everything
[04:13] and I think beneath the you know they
[04:15] always say money rules the world I think
[04:17] beneath that is energy rules the world
[04:19] so I think we're kind of in an
[04:20] interesting impass here right now where
[04:23] you know the bricks Nations Russia um
[04:26] you know China and everything they're
[04:28] almost playing the energy card right I
[04:30] mean Russia is a very energy dense
[04:32] country you saw what they were doing you
[04:34] know obviously what what's going on in
[04:35] Ukraine but what they're doing is
[04:37] essentially you know with the us trying
[04:39] to pull put tariffs on them and
[04:40] everything like that if Russia wanted to
[04:42] they could essentially just pull back
[04:43] the Reigns and not sell anybody oil and
[04:45] Europe and you know [ __ ] would really
[04:47] hit the fan what the US is doing is
[04:49] they're pulling the monetary policy arms
[04:51] so I think you know it's not necessarily
[04:54] like as drastic as the Cold War but I
[04:56] think that that's what's kind of going
[04:58] on here is that the US is pulling the
[05:00] monetary arm the brics nations are
[05:02] pulling the energy arm and at at a
[05:04] certain point these things are going to
[05:06] collide now what is going to be the
[05:07] driving factor or something that really
[05:09] pushes that over the edge I'm not quite
[05:11] sure I mean we do have an election
[05:13] coming up here in November so uh you
[05:15] know everybody kind of likes to think of
[05:17] the US like you know everything revolves
[05:19] around us which you know it kind of does
[05:21] because we have the the US uh dollar
[05:24] here but uh I think that could be
[05:25] something that definitely pushes it over
[05:27] the edge especially if we get the wrong
[05:29] leadership place so I I do think that
[05:32] everything's connected uh that's why I
[05:34] you know I speak to a lot of people not
[05:36] only in the Bitcoin space but in the you
[05:38] know economic space energy space and
[05:40] everything like that because you know I
[05:42] think whatever lever is pulled I think
[05:45] can affect prices of whatever good
[05:48] across the across the globe right I
[05:50] think you know if oil and gas becomes
[05:52] extremely expensive to import into the
[05:54] US bananas are going to be more
[05:56] expensive at the grocery store because
[05:58] somebody's got to drive D their drive
[06:00] and transport the bananas from wherever
[06:02] they got them into the grocery store so
[06:05] that that underlying cost is always
[06:06] going to be you know more expensive and
[06:09] so for you know the the grocery store to
[06:12] uh to pay their workers they're going to
[06:14] have to do that and then you know if
[06:15] everything goes up the the prices of uh
[06:18] employees is always going to go up so I
[06:20] think you know everything in this sense
[06:21] is always interconnected and uh yeah I
[06:25] definitely think that the Bitcoin you
[06:27] know really helps by solving a lot of
[06:29] the by encouraging renewable energy by
[06:32] encouraging um you know the use of uh
[06:35] you know getting more efficient energy
[06:37] uh prices and everything like that too
[06:39] so uh I definitely think it's all
[06:41] interconnected and it's something that
[06:43] uh is going to be very interesting to
[06:45] see how it all plays out in the next few
[06:47] months to say the very
[06:49] least how important or how impactful do
[06:51] you think is is the election uh that is
[06:54] coming up in in in November no matter if
[06:57] it's uh Trump or Harris probably
[07:00] probably will be one of those two yeah
[07:02] but but uh is is is that do you think
[07:06] that has an actual impact on on bitcoin
[07:09] on the price on the adoption
[07:10] curves I do um and I I think that it's
[07:15] more so uh just because of their
[07:17] economic policies um you know I think
[07:20] Cala Harris has kind of seen the the big
[07:23] bump in um you know Trump going to the
[07:26] Bitcoin conference and everything like
[07:27] that um now her campaign is accepting
[07:30] crypto for donations I think it's all
[07:32] kind of fake um but what I truly believe
[07:35] is is is more of people really have it
[07:37] out for Donald Trump meaning that
[07:40] there's a lot of um I guess people with
[07:44] a lot of power meaning a lot of money
[07:46] that don't really like Donald Trump
[07:48] because he's exposing a lot of what's
[07:50] going on in the Fiat system I think in
[07:52] 2016 we really saw that the American
[07:54] people are really you know feing for
[07:57] something like that they've been
[07:58] realizing that the politicians have been
[08:00] lying to us for years and years and
[08:02] years and Donald Trump was the first one
[08:03] to kind of expose that um you know every
[08:06] politician comes in they're going to
[08:07] help save you they're going to help you
[08:09] know do whatever but in reality none of
[08:11] them really are right I mean they're
[08:13] they're they're all just there just to
[08:14] stay in power and and get elected now
[08:18] what I think is going to happen if
[08:20] Donald Trump gets elected is that you
[08:22] know the powers that be are going to
[08:24] sell off the stock market uh which
[08:27] includes Bitcoin now with the ETFs
[08:29] you're going to see a big crash because
[08:31] there's a lot of cracks underneath the
[08:33] surface so you know the powers that be
[08:35] want to make everything crash for him
[08:38] and then Donald Trump's goingon to have
[08:39] to rebuild that in the next three and a
[08:41] half four years um where I I think
[08:44] basically at this point no matter what
[08:46] you do there's a a recession looming
[08:49] whether it's the severity of that we
[08:51] don't really know but if I think you
[08:53] know Camala Harris gets in office what I
[08:55] think is going to happen they're going
[08:56] to pull back interest rates and then
[08:58] they're going to throw a bunch of money
[08:59] into this system they're going to print
[09:00] a bunch of money so everything gets
[09:01] inflated for a couple years and then you
[09:04] know come this time in four years
[09:06] they're going to be saying the same song
[09:07] and dance I mean if you look back the
[09:10] past 16 years a democrat's been in in
[09:12] power uh 12 out of the last 16 with only
[09:15] the only Republican candidate being
[09:17] Donald Trump and that economy for you
[09:19] know For Better or For Worse it was one
[09:22] of the be better booming economies
[09:24] during that time period so you know I
[09:27] think that uh you know the powers that
[09:29] being really want uh a a Democrat
[09:31] president now we'll see how that all
[09:35] goes I I mean I'm kind of doing a little
[09:36] tinfoil hat thing here where I think
[09:38] that everybody's kind of I got it out
[09:40] for Donald Trump but I think you know if
[09:42] the assassination attempt and um you
[09:44] know kind of the way the media in the US
[09:46] portrays Donald Trump I I feel like it's
[09:49] kind of obvious here where where nobody
[09:51] that is in in actual power really wants
[09:53] it where the people on the ground if you
[09:55] go to an X poll or something like that
[09:57] that Elon puts out Trump by a lamb slide
[10:00] so maybe it's you know maybe it's just
[10:02] because of uh you know the audience
[10:05] that's on X but I I find it harder
[10:07] harder to believe that uh the polling
[10:09] and everything like that is really truly
[10:12] um you know I guess reflective of the
[10:14] United States people that's interesting
[10:16] I like to look at um po Market because
[10:20] there like people actually bet money on
[10:21] it uh it's it's interesting how how
[10:24] those those go and I think he's actually
[10:26] in front of that but it's an interesting
[10:28] point that you mentioned that uh with
[10:30] Trump uh Bitcoin could actually dump
[10:32] because Harris will Brint basically more
[10:35] money in the PO to be will continue as
[10:37] they are because yeah a lot of people
[10:39] seem to not realize that but Harris
[10:42] right now is already the vice president
[10:43] so like it's not a not a CA change
[10:46] completely it's like the last four years
[10:48] again I don't think there will be a lot
[10:50] of changes when when when when she comes
[10:52] in so what I hear you saying is Harris
[10:56] could be shortterm better for Bitcoin
[10:59] course she will print a buch of money
[11:01] but it will be worse for for the
[11:04] USA yeah I mean you know Bitcoin as uh
[11:08] the US Dollar exchange rate it would be
[11:10] better I think in the short term but you
[11:12] know I put out a tweet the other day and
[11:14] I'll just read uh uh some of these
[11:16] numbers to you so price increases since
[11:18] 2020 car payments are up 40% food price
[11:22] is up 25% electricity up 30% gas 35
[11:27] Transportation home prices are up 48%
[11:30] auto insurance and gasoline are up 50
[11:33] plus percent and mortgage rates are up
[11:35] 244 per. so I mean like you know it
[11:39] could be greater in the dollar exchange
[11:42] rate but how much is your purchasing
[11:44] power really going up you know I think
[11:46] that that's what we should really be
[11:47] looking at as far as like the Bitcoin
[11:50] price right I I don't really like
[11:52] looking at it and the US Dollar exchange
[11:54] rate right I mean everybody says you
[11:56] know the the classic saying one Bitcoin
[11:57] equals one Bitcoin but you know and I
[12:00] came out here and said that Bitcoin
[12:01] could be a million dollars in this cycle
[12:03] and I truly believe that because you
[12:05] know at the at the same time like you
[12:07] know the way that they're devaluing the
[12:09] dollar it's at at an extreme rate uh but
[12:12] the problem with all of that is that
[12:14] like many of us in the Bitcoin space
[12:16] know is that bit Bitcoin at a million
[12:20] dollars might not get you as much as
[12:22] Bitcoin at a million dollars like 10
[12:24] years ago I it actually it definitely
[12:26] won't right I mean you know at this
[12:28] point they're valuing everything your
[12:30] purchasing power is just going to go
[12:31] down but yeah I mean I think in the
[12:33] short term Camala Harris might be better
[12:35] for the Bitcoin price action but I think
[12:38] she's going to cause inflation to go
[12:40] through the absolute roof um and I think
[12:43] you know it's kind of uh maybe uh the
[12:46] accelerationist would would want her uh
[12:48] in office because it'll accelerate the
[12:51] devaluing of the dollar here and uh
[12:53] accelerate uh you know almost the
[12:55] downfall of the US so but as an American
[12:58] I want this to be kind of uh you know I
[13:00] guess a slower process so I always ask
[13:02] this I I see kind of like two paths to
[13:04] likeit hyperbitcoinization the first
[13:07] path is everything crashes and burns and
[13:09] then we basically have to rebuild it up
[13:11] there's a bunch of you know uh countries
[13:14] around the globe that are you know
[13:15] showing some strength maybe it's China
[13:18] maybe it's Russia maybe it's some of
[13:19] these other bigger countries and you
[13:22] know we kind of just are at an impass
[13:23] and everybody's kind of building
[13:25] themselves back up while the dollar is
[13:26] just you know almost going in in a
[13:28] Venezuela kind of or Zimbabwe manner
[13:31] here um but the other path is we get
[13:35] presidents in there like Trump or like
[13:37] some of these others that would want to
[13:38] keep the strength in the dollar
[13:40] recognizing the the true power of
[13:42] Bitcoin and uh maybe delaying that
[13:45] hyperbitcoinization we gives the
[13:46] builders time to build on the lightning
[13:48] Network and other things like that so we
[13:50] can get to that place then maybe we have
[13:52] a you know an in between currency where
[13:55] it's maybe the dollar they try to back
[13:56] it by Bitcoin but as humans do they mess
[13:59] that up and then eventually we get to a
[14:01] hyper Bitcoin IED world but um so I I
[14:05] think this is kind of the impass that
[14:06] we're at Harris everything crashes and
[14:09] burns maybe it's good for the shortterm
[14:11] of Bitcoin and then I think Trump it's
[14:13] it's kind of delaying that full Crash
[14:16] and Burn here so um maybe everybody
[14:19] always says it's the biggest election of
[14:20] our lives but I I I'm not quite sure
[14:23] about all that we we'll see how it goes
[14:25] I I don't think the president can do too
[14:27] much in the current system because they
[14:29] only have four years and uh there's a
[14:31] lot of checks and balances but I do
[14:33] think uh you know as far as like the
[14:35] Bitcoin policy and everything like that
[14:37] I do think it is very
[14:39] important it's interesting the landscape
[14:41] I mean I try to not like look too much
[14:43] at politics but I recognize that even as
[14:46] a bitcoiner it's important to look at
[14:49] politics to a certain extent to see
[14:51] what's going on and to see what what
[14:53] people are are doing because you're
[14:54] still a physical person in a in a
[14:56] country and yes Bitcoin will be
[14:58] successful no matter what but you might
[15:01] suffer because you're in a specific
[15:02] country and and and the laws are not not
[15:05] good for your I I advocate more and more
[15:07] for people just like see what the
[15:09] politics in your area and in your region
[15:12] are and and see how you might add a
[15:16] benefit or suffer from them and maybe
[15:18] there's another region that is better or
[15:20] you can do something against it's like
[15:22] that we we have to care a little bit
[15:24] about politics even as
[15:26] bitcoiners yeah exactly and I think you
[15:29] know at the end of the day people are
[15:30] going to go where the incentives lie
[15:32] right so we have obviously na bu and El
[15:35] Salvador has been doing great things
[15:37] with you know uh minimizing business tax
[15:40] and allowing basically Tech and Bitcoin
[15:42] companies to come down there be
[15:44] headquartered in El Salvador and you
[15:46] know not really have too many penalties
[15:48] before it was the US the US was the land
[15:51] of the entrepreneur the American dream
[15:52] and everything like that now we're even
[15:54] seeing like pockets of the US that
[15:56] aren't very friendly to entrepreneurs
[15:58] we're seeing
[15:59] Mass Exodus out of booming States like
[16:02] California and New York to States like
[16:04] Texas and Florida so the unique thing uh
[16:07] to a European uh guy uh about the US is
[16:10] that basically like every state it could
[16:12] almost be looked at as like a different
[16:13] country at this point um where the
[16:16] policies are different state to state
[16:18] and that kind of you know it's Unique
[16:20] where we have one un underlying um you
[16:23] know government but we also have state
[16:25] governments that make things friendly or
[16:27] not friendly so um I think we've seen it
[16:30] in the US on a micro level where people
[16:32] have been migrating from you know blue
[16:34] states to Red States meaning Democratic
[16:36] to to Republican states and I think
[16:39] we'll see it on a macro level where
[16:40] people maybe will start to leave the us
[16:42] or people will start to leave countries
[16:44] to more friendly countries like El
[16:46] Salvador or um you know maybe if
[16:48] Argentina starts booming or Surinam like
[16:50] all these other countries that are
[16:52] starting to embrace you know the tech
[16:55] and and everything like that I think you
[16:56] know people are people are very smart
[16:58] they can move place to place very easily
[17:01] uh I think it will be hard for some
[17:02] people to obviously like leave their
[17:04] families and everything like that
[17:05] everybody's different but I think uh you
[17:07] know I've seen it in the Bitcoin space
[17:09] and with you know the digital Nomad kind
[17:11] of uh aspect and everything like that I
[17:14] think it makes it easier for
[17:15] entrepreneurs to go to different
[17:17] countries and I think that that's going
[17:19] to be a trend that we kind of see going
[17:21] forward where we see a lot of businesses
[17:24] have maybe a location in a different
[17:26] country but that person does even live
[17:28] there or they just have a po. box or
[17:30] something like that as their you know
[17:32] corporate headquarters and you know
[17:34] they're just traveling the world and
[17:35] doing all these kind of things so yeah I
[17:38] mean I definitely think that people are
[17:40] going to go where the incentives lie and
[17:42] the incentives in the US are definitely
[17:44] waning for sure absolutely it also it
[17:48] kind of cracks down on the on the
[17:50] strength from the US dollar also if the
[17:51] US is not as adjective anymore it's an
[17:54] interesting thing it's it's kind of goes
[17:55] in this um uh Global Game Theory of of
[17:59] nation states on a Bitcoin level but
[18:01] also like on a sovereignty level uh it's
[18:04] really cool did you already visited El
[18:06] Salvador yeah I've been to El Salvador
[18:09] I'm going again uh to adopting Bitcoin
[18:11] here in November I'm speaking um and I
[18:14] got a panel and other things like that
[18:15] so it's I've been down there it's it's
[18:18] great I mean you know I I think
[18:20] everybody in the Bitcoin space really
[18:22] props up L Salvador I think it's
[18:24] absolutely great and it's you know you
[18:25] can see a lot of improvements a lot of
[18:27] people tell tell you about you know the
[18:29] roads and everything like that coming up
[18:31] but it's still got a ways to develop
[18:33] right I mean I'm I'm spoiled in the US
[18:36] here like I have hot water wherever I go
[18:38] like there's little things that you
[18:40] notice that still aren't there in El
[18:42] Salvador but it's you know to be honest
[18:44] it's it started as like a third world
[18:46] country one of the most dangerous
[18:47] countries in the world I felt safer
[18:49] there than I do in a lot of big cities
[18:51] at night you know going out being an
[18:54] idiot get drinking a couple beers and
[18:55] wandering around I had no no issue with
[18:58] anything like that um but yeah I mean El
[19:01] Salvador is great and I think it's
[19:03] improving I still think it has a ways to
[19:05] go and I'm you know I'm confident that
[19:07] the way that bu has been running it in
[19:09] the next what I think it's like four or
[19:11] five years or however much his next term
[19:13] is um I think that's going to continue
[19:15] so um you know hopefully with everything
[19:18] like that it you know still still
[19:20] running strong but uh yeah excited to go
[19:22] back again in November here I'm also
[19:25] going in in November the first time ever
[19:27] I will be at adopting Bitcoin going to I
[19:29] love it a lot like I had so many
[19:31] Salvadorian people on my podcast the the
[19:34] past couple months then I was like a I
[19:37] really have to visit at least once I I
[19:39] want to I want to know what's going on
[19:41] actually down there and not just like
[19:43] talk from third person perspectives yeah
[19:47] sure yeah man let's yeah come on down
[19:49] let's uh let's go surfing or something
[19:51] dude I got I got a guy a local guy that
[19:53] I've uh been connected with and he gave
[19:55] me some great surfing lessons uh and El
[19:57] tunco so so not necessarily the Bitcoin
[20:00] Beach but uh yeah there's a lot of great
[20:02] stuff uh down there and I think I think
[20:04] every bitcoiner should visit it and you
[20:06] know I mean to me I'm just kind of like
[20:08] one of those guys that likes to travel a
[20:09] little bit so I think everybody should
[20:11] go down there no matter what I mean it's
[20:12] beautiful country and uh very safe good
[20:15] food all that kind of stuff are we
[20:18] seeing uh right now in real life the the
[20:21] sovereign individual kind of playing out
[20:24] when when we look at all the things that
[20:26] we are talking about with Bitcoin and
[20:27] and uh incentives around the
[20:30] world yeah I mean I I 100% I believe
[20:34] that right I think at everybody's core
[20:36] they really want to be a sovereign
[20:38] individual and I think obviously that's
[20:40] a that's a message that uh bitcoiners
[20:42] kind of find um but you know I mean just
[20:45] on the ground here and I'm in Tampa
[20:47] Florida so I mean on the ground here I
[20:49] always tell people I think my friends
[20:50] are like 99% of the way there they just
[20:53] don't realize that Bitcoin is the
[20:55] solution for a lot of this a lot of
[20:57] people in the US are starting to realize
[20:59] like they're pumping a bunch of
[21:00] antibiotics in the food that big Pharma
[21:02] is not necessarily good obviously we saw
[21:05] what what happened just for short years
[21:07] ago and I think that opened a lot of
[21:08] people's eyes um the one thing that they
[21:11] that they're still kind of hung up on is
[21:13] they find safety in the banks even
[21:15] though we've seen um you know big things
[21:17] like Silicon Valley Bank and other big
[21:19] Bank crashes here in the US there's
[21:22] still like oh my money's safe there so I
[21:25] I think that there's going to be need
[21:26] needing a little bit more pain to be
[21:28] felt in order for Mass uh like the the
[21:31] majority of people at least in the US
[21:33] from what I can tell to to understand
[21:35] that but I think in the Bitcoin space
[21:37] obviously that's playing out right I
[21:39] mean it's a no-brainer here um you know
[21:41] I know plenty of people that are digital
[21:43] Nomads traveling from place to place um
[21:45] going to all these different conferences
[21:48] um connecting with people from all over
[21:49] the globe I mean yeah look look at us
[21:52] here right I'm in Florida you're you're
[21:53] across in Europe and and we're talking
[21:55] over this I think you know all these
[21:57] people are kind of realizing in that
[21:59] that you don't really necessarily need
[22:00] to be you know locked into one specific
[22:03] Place go into the office do that nto5
[22:05] kind of grind I think people are getting
[22:07] sick of that and uh you know I think
[22:09] that's occurring like all over the globe
[22:11] so I think the sovereign individual is
[22:13] really playing out and I think that
[22:14] that's going to continue and uh
[22:17] especially if you know governments try
[22:19] to overbear their power more and more I
[22:21] think that that's going to continue to
[22:23] to push people to resist that right I
[22:26] mean you know you just got to think
[22:28] every everybody was a kid at one point
[22:29] in time right I mean uh what what did
[22:31] you always want to do against your
[22:33] parents whenever they told you to do
[22:34] something you wanted to Rebel right I
[22:36] mean I don't think that we really get
[22:38] away from that necessarily I think we
[22:40] just get kind of programmed to tell to
[22:43] live in the simulation so to speak where
[22:45] you have to do this this and this but at
[22:47] everybody's core I think everybody wants
[22:49] to be you know a sovereign individual
[22:51] and really wants to you know find their
[22:53] path in that way in that sense will at
[22:56] some point the generation fight against
[22:58] Bitcoin the the Bitcoin
[23:01] Monopoly yeah um what do you mean like
[23:04] fight against the Gen the no no no I
[23:06] just you just said like the the
[23:07] generation uh like you you fight against
[23:10] your par parents you you have a
[23:12] rebellion and if we think long-term out
[23:15] and there's like a Bitcoin World maybe
[23:17] there's a generation coming up that for
[23:19] some reason don't like some money they
[23:21] want something else uh is it possible
[23:24] like do do you see Bitcoin as the end
[23:26] all be all final money that that we have
[23:28] and it's the perfect thing but or do you
[23:31] think that's just the the next step to
[23:33] maybe something even greater yeah I mean
[23:36] I I think that you know that won't
[23:38] happen really in our lifetime I think
[23:40] like the the way that it's going to
[23:42] develop is still going to be looked at
[23:44] as like digital gold U Maybe I'm Wrong
[23:47] um you know I mean Parker Lewis always
[23:48] says the gradually then suddenly I just
[23:51] don't know if we're really close to that
[23:52] suddenly impass just yet um but what I
[23:56] think is uh you know I think that
[23:58] there's always going to be crypto and
[23:59] shitcoin tokens popping up I think
[24:01] everybody's going to have that um
[24:03] because there's just low barrier to
[24:04] entry like we could go on and create uh
[24:07] you know Robin S token or uh you know
[24:10] Brandon or green candle token or
[24:12] something like that and just kind of you
[24:14] know pump and dump that and I think that
[24:16] that everybody gets a little bit curious
[24:18] and is still thinking in that Fiat
[24:20] mindset so you know what what I always
[24:22] tell people is the biggest driver the
[24:24] biggest orange pillar whether we like it
[24:26] or not is the Bitcoin price right so you
[24:29] know there's always going to be stories
[24:30] out there that of somebody who had
[24:32] invested into some crypto token and went
[24:35] from you know $1 to a millionaire and I
[24:37] think a lot of people are always going
[24:39] to be chasing that just because of you
[24:41] know the where where we're at in society
[24:43] like everybody wants an easy kind of way
[24:45] out um and I think you know it's going
[24:48] to take a while for us to get to that
[24:50] point where everybody's kind of working
[24:51] to become their own sovereign individual
[24:54] um and so with all that being said I
[24:57] think you know there's going to be a lot
[24:59] of you know there's gradual adoption
[25:01] here in the US and and around the world
[25:04] um but I think that uh you know that
[25:07] gradual adoption is uh you know going to
[25:09] be slowed just kind of by the the crypto
[25:12] tokens and other unforeseen
[25:14] circumstances and you know I I still
[25:16] think that there's human greed out there
[25:18] I don't know if Bitcoin will necessarily
[25:20] get rid of all of that there was greed
[25:22] in ancient times when you know we were
[25:24] on a gold standard or just kind of a
[25:26] fixed Fiat or a fixed standard right
[25:28] whether it was seashells or whatever it
[25:31] was right so I think that there's always
[25:34] going to be some sort of greed some sort
[25:36] of person trying to rip some people off
[25:38] um and everything like that so I I don't
[25:40] think that in a hyper Bitcoin IED world
[25:42] it's necessarily going to be this like
[25:44] utopian uh thing that a lot of
[25:46] bitcoiners like to think it it might be
[25:48] but uh I definitely think that a lot of
[25:50] corruption and a lot of things that we
[25:52] see is due to the money and uh you know
[25:54] the Fiat system encourages chaos is a is
[25:57] something I like to say because you know
[25:59] if you think about it covid War whatever
[26:02] it is you always got to pump money into
[26:05] the system and who always profits off
[26:07] that it's usually the people that are in
[26:09] charge so I think we'll get away from a
[26:11] lot of that maybe Wars won't necessarily
[26:14] stop I think that they they'll still be
[26:16] there um but I think they'll be less
[26:18] frequent and uh you know these boom and
[26:20] bus cycles that we've been seeing lately
[26:22] are going to be less frequent as well so
[26:25] you know I don't know if we'll
[26:26] necessarily have people rebelling
[26:28] against Bitcoin uh not using it and
[26:31] trying to use that I do think that
[26:32] there's going to be popups of other
[26:34] crypto tokens um just because there's
[26:37] just low barrier to entry but you know
[26:40] that with all that being said like do
[26:42] people really Rebel and not use the
[26:45] dollar now I think like everybody just
[26:47] uses what's easier in that sense right I
[26:49] mean I think it's more of rebelling
[26:51] against the laws opposed to rebelling
[26:53] against the
[26:54] money yeah it's it's funny I I feel like
[26:57] more people should rebel against the V
[27:00] currencies especially like I I get why
[27:03] people are still comfortable and safe in
[27:06] the US or in Austria in Europe somewhere
[27:08] because yes we have inflation yes it's
[27:10] bad but it's not imminent bad like it's
[27:13] not like oh you go one day to the
[27:15] supermarket and the banana is $1 all of
[27:18] a sudden next week the banana is $2 like
[27:20] we don't have crazy inflation we have
[27:23] really bad inflation and even 1%
[27:25] inflation is too much inflation but it's
[27:27] not like people are completely freaked
[27:30] out and completely like that but we have
[27:33] countries like Argentina like Turkish Li
[27:36] where the inflation is like that like
[27:39] from Argentina I just got from someone
[27:42] from Ariel from The Argentinian prophecy
[27:45] uh offer guy uh was on on my podcast and
[27:49] he said like in the last five years uh
[27:52] the salary in Argentina developed
[27:55] drastically bad like five years ago the
[27:58] average salary of someone in living in
[28:00] Argentina was a thousand US dollar now
[28:03] it's $300 usar so like there are
[28:06] actually big problems in those
[28:08] countries but still they they flee to
[28:11] the US dollar they flee not to bitcoin
[28:13] the that there so many distractions
[28:15] going on like what has to happen that
[28:17] people see Bitcoin they have to feel the
[28:21] pain man I mean that's that's why a lot
[28:23] of people in these countries that have
[28:25] experienced hyperinflation get Bitcoin
[28:27] right right I mean you know if you look
[28:29] at the US dollar exactly like you said
[28:32] right I mean like I don't know I work a
[28:34] 9 to-5 job hopefully I'm out of it soon
[28:36] but theoretically my salary is going to
[28:39] go up 3% at a minimum really right I
[28:42] mean majority of people see that and you
[28:45] know majority of people in the covid
[28:47] time saw I could jump from in an office
[28:50] job to an a remote job and be making
[28:53] $30,000 more by doing the same exact
[28:55] thing they make a lateral move different
[28:57] company
[28:58] because of all of that so I think you
[29:00] know one there's going to be need to be
[29:02] tough Economic Times that are explained
[29:05] by the dollar right I mean in 2008
[29:07] everybody saw it they're like oh it's
[29:09] the housing crisis it was the banks just
[29:11] lending out a bunch of money and that
[29:13] was the issue it wasn't the underlying
[29:15] currency it was just that basically
[29:16] money was free at that point and uh
[29:19] people didn't really equate it to that
[29:20] so it's whatever they could sell here in
[29:23] this next Crisis that if the American
[29:25] people are really buying what they
[29:27] putting down they're going to just
[29:29] equate it to everything's fine the
[29:31] problem is is majority of Americans
[29:32] right now what we've been off the gold
[29:34] standard since 1971 so 53 Years
[29:37] everybody in the working age right now
[29:39] has never experienced a gold standard or
[29:42] a hard money standard of anything like
[29:44] that uh you know essentially ever unless
[29:47] you got somebody who's working at 80
[29:48] years old maybe they you know I mean
[29:50] even then right I mean the only time
[29:52] they experienced that was at like when
[29:54] they were 14 or something like that
[29:56] right so um you you know I think uh
[29:59] people just haven't experienced that
[30:01] it's all they know they've basically
[30:04] equated like this is what you do like
[30:05] get in line and uh you know I think that
[30:08] that's until that system is uh you know
[30:12] I guess in a sense just either crumbling
[30:14] or something Falls or breaks around them
[30:17] they're not going to really get it uh
[30:19] you know I think that's why Latin
[30:20] America is so big on bitcoin because
[30:22] they've had a lot of you know currencies
[30:25] either get hyperinflated and a lot of
[30:27] people have experienced hyperinflation
[30:30] or they're on the opposite side of
[30:32] things and they're you know run by the
[30:34] US in a sense um with the US dollar and
[30:37] the US prints all this money gives all
[30:39] the way this stimulus and these Latin
[30:41] American countries just don't profit off
[30:43] of it and don't experience any of it so
[30:45] I think you know with all that being
[30:47] said I think in the US Europe all these
[30:49] other places they're going to have to
[30:51] experience pain it's the it's the
[30:53] biggest driver the biggest lesson um you
[30:55] know I think everybody kind of looks at
[30:57] Bitcoin now as some funny internet money
[31:00] or something like that or a way to get
[31:01] rich um and and rich in Fiat terms and
[31:05] so with all that you know it's it's
[31:07] really going to take you know something
[31:10] about the currency that you use whether
[31:12] it's the Euro or the dollar or the pound
[31:14] or something like that to really really
[31:16] just uh push the average person over the
[31:19] edge because majority of people just
[31:20] don't even like to think about money and
[31:22] how it's coming in or anything like that
[31:24] if you watch my podcast already for more
[31:26] than two times you know how extremely
[31:29] passionate I am about self- custody and
[31:32] the first very very very important step
[31:35] to self cust is always getting yourself
[31:39] a hardware wallet and I have one for you
[31:42] here this is the Bitcoin only Edition
[31:44] from the bitbox my favorite single
[31:47] signature Hardware wallet on the market
[31:49] another really important piece of self-
[31:53] custody if you have a hardware wallet is
[31:55] the backup of the seat phrase and bit
[31:58] box made the perfect solution to back up
[32:00] your seat phrase they made a reusable
[32:03] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[32:06] durable and extremely heavy if I put it
[32:09] on the desk I seriously fear for my own
[32:13] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[32:16] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[32:19] secure go to bitbox
[32:22] do/ robobin to get your bitbox and if
[32:25] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[32:30] of your complete order and the next step
[32:33] is to really level up your sovereignty
[32:35] as an individual you have to have the
[32:37] most secure self custody setup you have
[32:40] to secure your own devices you have to
[32:43] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:46] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:49] where you live you even want to have a
[32:51] plan be a citizenship where you can move
[32:54] in case something goes really really
[32:56] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:58] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:01] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:03] way.com
[33:05] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[33:08] minute free call to find out how you can
[33:10] level up your sovereignty and last but
[33:13] not least I have something completely
[33:15] new for you guys I partnered up with
[33:19] coin vigilante this is the most
[33:21] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[33:24] saw created by anyone look at that I
[33:28] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[33:31] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[33:34] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[33:37] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[33:39] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[33:43] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[33:45] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[33:49] watch collections you have the date of
[33:51] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[33:54] there and of course also the block
[33:56] height and which Epoch we are currently
[34:00] in I love the level of detail they put
[34:03] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:05] check out those amazing coin vilante
[34:08] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[34:11] love those watches so so much it's
[34:14] really interesting when I when I hear
[34:16] that it's also for me it gets sometimes
[34:19] hard to believe that we have a peaceful
[34:22] Revolution we always say like the
[34:23] Bitcoin will be a peaceful Revolution
[34:26] and we will a peaceful transition to to
[34:28] to do the Bitcoin but if if a large
[34:31] majority only sees the problem when they
[34:33] in pain this means a lot of people are
[34:36] in pain at that point that there can be
[34:39] a lot of things go really wrong at that
[34:42] that point do do you do you subscribe to
[34:44] like a peaceful revolution in Bitcoin I
[34:48] well I mean it's it's how how you look
[34:50] at it right so I mean it depends what
[34:51] country you're in um you know I can only
[34:53] speak on what I see in like the US um
[34:56] which obviously has the dollar and
[34:57] everything the way I see it now is I
[35:00] think the US has never been more divided
[35:03] um as far as like political things you
[35:05] know go uh I feel like every election
[35:08] that we have everybody gets very much
[35:10] more upset um you know we kind of saw it
[35:13] in um you know during 2020 where you
[35:16] know if you didn't get the you know the
[35:18] jab or anything like that you know
[35:19] people were yelling at you saying you're
[35:21] the worst you're killing all these
[35:22] people all that right for stuff that
[35:25] quite frankly wasn't really B uh based
[35:28] on any types of facts or anything like
[35:30] that um so I think you know from a
[35:33] political standpoint I know it's not
[35:34] always all around that but I think from
[35:37] a political standpoint people in the US
[35:38] are very divided um and I think you know
[35:42] from a monetary standpoint people are
[35:44] even more divided you know every time
[35:46] there's a a crash or something like that
[35:49] there the wealth Gap increase right
[35:51] asset prices Skyrocket um people with
[35:53] homes businesses everything like that
[35:55] and the the average person who's working
[35:57] a salary job you know can't really
[36:00] afford as much maybe needs to sell off
[36:01] their savings and everything like that
[36:03] so I think the more of these cycles that
[36:05] we go through where you know there's
[36:07] boom and bust and asset prices rise like
[36:10] crazy I think the rich are going to get
[36:12] richer the poor are going to get poor
[36:14] and then the poor are basically going to
[36:15] rebel and I think that that's continuing
[36:17] in the US and it's just a matter of how
[36:19] much money printing we're going to go
[36:21] through and that Gap is just going to
[36:23] keep widening so I think if that Gap
[36:25] keeps widening which I don't see a way
[36:27] that it can't you know we're in this
[36:29] debt spiral we're going to have to
[36:31] either print more money to to get out
[36:33] the debt or print money to buy Bitcoin
[36:35] and you know kind of hope that it uh in
[36:37] a sense
[36:38] Bitcoin uh you know uh helps the us and
[36:42] we use it as a strategic Reserve here um
[36:45] you know I I I I just don't see a a
[36:48] world where um you know the wealth Gap
[36:51] uh the political pressures the
[36:53] geopolitical pressures with everything
[36:55] going across across the pond here and
[36:58] just the devaluation of the dollar you
[37:00] know I just don't see a way that this
[37:02] ends where everything is all peaches and
[37:05] daisies and we're just like oh you know
[37:07] everybody just bends over and like ah
[37:09] you you guys can use Bitcoin it's great
[37:11] I think the powers that be are always
[37:12] going to want to stay in power and
[37:14] they're going to do whatever they can to
[37:15] do that how do you see um all those fear
[37:18] related institutions like Social
[37:21] Security and and Forex exchange and like
[37:24] all those fear related markets that have
[37:28] a lot of power and a lot of influence
[37:29] right now but might not have all that
[37:32] influence and power when when we come to
[37:33] a honest
[37:35] world I mean Social Security is like the
[37:38] biggest Ponzi scheme in you in history
[37:41] at this point I mean there's no there's
[37:42] no money to pay it out but somehow we
[37:44] keep paying it out how is that going to
[37:46] continue to happen I mean we're just
[37:48] going to have to print more money so you
[37:50] know it's Social Security should be
[37:52] something that you know I I mean in a
[37:54] hyper Bitcoin eyes world everything that
[37:57] you know parents in the US and I'm sure
[37:59] your parents kind of raised you on is
[38:01] all all great right save just save money
[38:04] save your way and you'll be able to live
[38:07] uh you know a happy life if you're able
[38:08] to save right because your money would
[38:11] theoretically you know grow in
[38:13] purchasing power while you're saving and
[38:16] getting older and older and older and so
[38:19] if you're able to save in a hyper
[38:20] Bitcoin IED world you don't really need
[38:22] uh Social Security to help bail you out
[38:25] when you're um you know old and crusty
[38:28] and you could barely walk up and
[38:29] downstairs right I think um you know at
[38:32] a certain point uh hyper Bitcoin eyes
[38:34] world or a hard money standard or
[38:36] something like that a lot of these
[38:37] policies are not necessarily needed you
[38:39] know retirement funds
[38:41] 401ks um you know that was basically
[38:43] started as a big scam because the way
[38:45] that inflation was going uh you know uh
[38:48] companies just didn't want to give
[38:50] everybody as much of a raise as
[38:52] inflation so they you know said hey let
[38:54] us help manage your money and we'll put
[38:57] it in this 401K which will devalue uh
[39:00] over time and money that will devalue
[39:02] over time but will help invest it for
[39:04] you for the long period of time and we
[39:05] don't have to pay taxes on it in fact we
[39:08] actually get a tax break for businesses
[39:10] for that so you know I think retirement
[39:13] accounts I think Social Security all
[39:15] that stuff is is almost a sham here in
[39:17] the US at least I mean I know a lot of
[39:19] these policies um you know try to make
[39:21] it where they're friendly for you I
[39:24] think there's very few that are actually
[39:26] good accounts that you know the average
[39:28] person if you're good with your money
[39:30] needs I think if everybody can kind of
[39:32] just you know take a couple hours to
[39:34] learn what to do with their money the
[39:36] best I think everybody would come to the
[39:38] conclusion just buy Bitcoin and hold it
[39:40] um and you know that would be the best
[39:42] way to protect your purchasing power you
[39:45] don't have to become like a stock Trader
[39:46] or anything like that and uh you know
[39:49] but I I think unfortunately a lot of
[39:51] people just don't want to think about
[39:53] their money don't want to think about
[39:54] you know anything like that so they'd
[39:56] rather give that responsibility to
[39:58] someone else instead of taking the
[40:00] personal responsibility and that I think
[40:02] is just because they're in a job that
[40:04] they don't like which you know they're
[40:07] and they're forced to work there 40
[40:08] hours a week they're you know eating
[40:10] food that is essentially poisoning them
[40:13] and then they get tired you know after
[40:14] driving the hour to work hour to back so
[40:17] they're spending you know 60 hours a
[40:19] week all about their job their
[40:21] personality needs to be their job they
[40:22] need to go to happy hours to please
[40:24] their boss to kiss some ass to move up
[40:27] and then you know with all that then
[40:28] they're too tired to go back and enjoy
[40:31] time with their wife or kids or whatever
[40:34] and you know I think it's just this
[40:35] never-ending cycle that that the Fiat
[40:37] system puts you in where you know you
[40:39] don't really want to think about money
[40:40] or something else that causes you stress
[40:43] and so because people don't think about
[40:45] that you know before it too late before
[40:48] it's too late it either causes a divorce
[40:51] or something along those lines I mean
[40:53] you know that's why we see a lot of the
[40:54] problems here in the world and I think
[40:56] that's why you know Bitcoin kind of
[40:58] resonate like fix the money fix the
[40:59] world so much because of all the
[41:01] underlying issues and stresses and
[41:03] things like that that money causes I
[41:05] think uh you know Bitcoin can help fix a
[41:07] lot of those things it's really
[41:09] interesting the for me the phrase uh fix
[41:12] the money fix the world um and and and
[41:14] sometimes it it goes too far for me
[41:17] sometimes I feel like we we think that
[41:19] oh yeah like once we have Bitcoin like
[41:21] there will be nothing else like we don't
[41:23] have any problems at all then um uh and
[41:27] and think you don't see it like that but
[41:29] um what do you think does Bitcoin not
[41:32] solve like even in a hyper Bitcoin world
[41:34] we have sound money we don't have any
[41:36] feat institution left like what are the
[41:38] problems what are the things in the
[41:40] world that are wrong that still will be
[41:42] there I think there's still going to be
[41:44] Fiat institutions I still think that
[41:46] there's going to be Banks I still think
[41:48] that there's going to be people that are
[41:50] like you know it's it's all self-
[41:51] responsibility at a certain point right
[41:53] so I still think there's going to be
[41:54] scammers out there hey I mean we've seen
[41:56] it already people in Bitcoin that send
[41:58] Bitcoin to random people because um you
[42:02] know somebody left a comment on my
[42:03] YouTube the other day I was like Hey
[42:05] like yeah like I don't need any more
[42:06] Bitcoin I scammed people at a 7.5
[42:09] Bitcoin it's like all right cool man
[42:11] like you scammed people but like you
[42:13] didn't really like provide value to get
[42:15] that that Bitcoin so I still think
[42:17] there's going to be people out there no
[42:19] matter what if they believe in Bitcoin
[42:21] and everything like that there's still
[42:22] the human greed people wanted to take
[42:24] shortcuts and everything like that so I
[42:27] think the overarching theme of Bitcoin
[42:30] is great and I do think that people in
[42:32] general will be better people I still
[42:34] think there's going to be bad apples
[42:36] situations that you know people got
[42:38] raised in or whatever that caused them
[42:41] to be some way whatever we explain it to
[42:43] be um you know I I still think that
[42:45] there's still going to be people out
[42:46] there that try to Rebel go against
[42:48] something try to find a way try to find
[42:50] a cheap shortcut you know to to get rich
[42:53] uh try to scam their way that kind of
[42:55] stuff I don't think that you know we're
[42:58] going to really be someplace where it's
[43:00] a this perfect Utopia and everybody's
[43:03] like you know uh perfect and kind of
[43:05] working that way I still think that
[43:07] there's you know people still have free
[43:09] reign and I think uh you know some
[43:11] people will choose to use that in a
[43:12] negative light but I think majority of
[43:14] people will will in a hyper Bitcoin eyes
[43:17] World get to a point where you know
[43:19] everything is Peaches and daisies for
[43:21] for majority of people do you think that
[43:24] things like um like that's one of my
[43:27] favorite things to say like this this
[43:30] green energy Li I think you even
[43:31] mentioned it once time in your podcast
[43:34] um where a lot of companies even virtual
[43:37] signaling like oh yeah we are green
[43:39] Company Green company and then they're
[43:40] doing it Al like my favorite examples is
[43:42] like really politicians drive with like
[43:45] uh a plane somewhere and drive with the
[43:47] car somewhere and right before it hop on
[43:49] the bike for like a few meters will we
[43:51] have still those those those things in
[43:54] in a in a Bitcoin world is that kind of
[43:56] the scam that we still will be seeing
[43:59] yeah I mean everything's just a facade
[44:01] right I mean everything in in the
[44:02] Bitcoin or in a a Fiat world is you know
[44:06] fugazi fugazi right I mean that was seen
[44:08] in the world full of Wall Street where
[44:09] the guy's like you know just you sell
[44:11] these people on these penny stocks and
[44:13] like maybe it goes up maybe it won't you
[44:15] you don't really know you know I think
[44:17] that that's uh you everything will be
[44:19] kind of a a facade and you know it's uh
[44:22] you know I'm reading that book The the
[44:24] 48 Laws of Power right now and it's kind
[44:26] of like you know what ever the
[44:27] perception is is something that uh you
[44:30] know can kind of help people control
[44:32] things right so I think that's what a
[44:34] lot of people you know give off right I
[44:37] mean and you're seeing it in a lot of
[44:39] the political races like how are these
[44:41] people trying to be in power well you
[44:43] know you got Taylor Swift endorsing
[44:45] Camala Harris right but what does Taylor
[44:48] Swift do Taylor Swift flies a private
[44:49] jet every day all across the globe right
[44:52] I mean she uses her carbon footprint is
[44:55] bigger than me you and probably
[44:57] everybody that listens to this podcast
[44:59] combined and uh you know and but she's
[45:02] the one endorsing for green energy and
[45:04] everything like that but is green energy
[45:06] really green right I mean it's all a
[45:08] perception right I mean you go to you
[45:10] know Africa and people digging up uh you
[45:13] know big giant trucks of lithium for
[45:15] these electronic vehicles and then they
[45:17] can't you know recycle these electron or
[45:20] these uh big giant batteries and it just
[45:22] pollutes the world and everything like
[45:24] that but it's the perception that you're
[45:26] doing things right right I mean it's not
[45:28] uh good in you know feasibility sense
[45:31] but it makes people feel good that it's
[45:33] green oh I'm helping the environment and
[45:35] everything like that um and so it's all
[45:37] the perception and that's how people
[45:39] have been able to control people um you
[45:41] know because they perceive that they're
[45:43] doing something good and lighthearted
[45:45] and I think that you know that's one of
[45:47] the things that the 48 Laws of Power
[45:49] talks about is like if you can be
[45:50] perceive that you're doing something
[45:52] good and it makes you you know an
[45:53] emotional you know response and um you
[45:56] know you you'll kind of be more likely
[45:58] to do that I mean you look at like
[45:59] Charities uh Charities are a big example
[46:02] right in the US a lot of Charities are
[46:05] some of the most corrupt organizations
[46:07] in the US because you can donate to
[46:10] these Charities you get a tax break and
[46:13] you feel good about it because you're
[46:14] donating to some Charities but majority
[46:17] of these people just you know launder
[46:19] the money or they um you know utilize
[46:22] Charities as some back end to get a tax
[46:24] break and they don't necessarily um you
[46:27] know do whatever that cause is saying
[46:30] and because it's a nonprofit and they
[46:32] don't worry about making money they
[46:34] can't fail essentially and so I think
[46:37] you know a lot of these things like this
[46:39] um you know it's all about perception
[46:41] and I think that's where the green
[46:43] energy policies have kind of lied um and
[46:46] uh you know a lot of things in the US
[46:48] and in the Fiat system are still there I
[46:51] think um you know like I said I think as
[46:53] long as there's uh still places where
[46:56] you could deceive people and
[46:57] everything's not fully open source and
[46:59] you can see everything there's still
[47:01] privatized businesses and everything
[47:03] like that you're never going to really
[47:04] know it's all about it's at a certain
[47:06] point there's always going to be a
[47:07] little bit aspect of trust here or there
[47:10] um we're not going to be in a truly
[47:12] decentralized world where you have to
[47:13] you know you can you know just raise a
[47:15] cow raise your whole family you don't
[47:17] need to interact with everybody you're
[47:18] going to have to interact with people
[47:20] you know in order to help the society
[47:22] prosper and at a certain point you're
[47:24] going to have to trust somebody to help
[47:25] you out and so you know are we going to
[47:28] put the right people that we can trust
[47:29] in those places you know you never
[47:31] really know right I mean you you you
[47:33] would hope in a hyperbitcoinization
[47:41] or somebody corrupt in charge uh that
[47:44] can set back uh the entire nation or you
[47:48] know the globe for years to years at a
[47:51] time and so I think that that could be
[47:53] you know something that I that I deeply
[47:55] worry about and I think that you know
[47:57] bitcoiners almost undermined that in a
[47:59] sense where it's uh you know
[48:01] everything's going to be great and
[48:03] there's greener pastures ahead I
[48:04] definitely think that there is but I
[48:06] definitely you know am am a little bit
[48:09] more cautious where I think that you
[48:10] know not everything is going to be you
[48:12] know perfect in a Bitcoin IED World
[48:15] absolutely and by the way the the 48
[48:18] powers of law I think something with
[48:19] green Robert Green or something like
[48:21] that is the offer uh it's it's on my
[48:24] audible list for a long time is it is it
[48:26] a good one is that something I should
[48:28] listen to yeah I'm about like I think
[48:31] I'm in like the 24th or no I'm on the
[48:34] 26th law right now so it is it is very
[48:36] long even an audio book I think it's
[48:38] it's a pretty long uh listen but um you
[48:41] know I think it's it's very it's
[48:43] interesting right I mean it's just kind
[48:45] of I think um you know books like that
[48:47] to me are you know I wouldn't call it
[48:50] like a selfhelp book or anything like
[48:52] that but I I think it's interesting how
[48:54] um you know a lot of people come to the
[48:57] same conclusions whether it's uh you
[48:59] know books about I don't know how to get
[49:01] women or books about you know how to
[49:03] raise your money all of them kind of
[49:05] have the same undertone and it's just
[49:07] presented to you in a different manner
[49:09] um you know and then people have talked
[49:11] about this book and kind of a a way that
[49:13] it can help you uh just kind of figure
[49:15] out your true true self and get get in
[49:17] that sense and I think you know for me
[49:20] I'm a very analytical thinker just being
[49:22] able to figure out the explanation as to
[49:24] why uh things and people did this uh did
[49:27] whatever action it is um I think it it
[49:30] it kind of helps me a lot so um I
[49:33] recommend it I I'm not completely done
[49:35] with it yet I still got what 22 23 laws
[49:39] to to get through but I think so far
[49:41] from what I'm learning it's it's good
[49:43] and it's something that I'm probably
[49:44] going to keep on rotation and keep
[49:45] reverting back to uh following this uh
[49:48] following when I finish it for sure oh
[49:51] really cool I was just curious because
[49:53] uh I was like ah I heard good things
[49:55] about it but
[49:57] it's a long one I I don't remember how
[49:59] many hours it was on Audible but it it
[50:01] was it was a long one this was something
[50:03] very long and I was like ah I don't know
[50:05] if I want to get into this right now
[50:08] yeah I mean if you got Spotify uh I
[50:10] think the Spotify Premium it it comes
[50:12] with it so uh I kept getting it
[50:14] recommended to me so I was like all
[50:16] right I I'll see it um you know I I
[50:18] listened to some podcast and I listen to
[50:21] audio books in my free time and uh you
[50:23] know I kind of uh it's one that it's
[50:25] like all right I can it on don't really
[50:27] need to think it tells a lot of stories
[50:29] as kind of like throughout history and
[50:31] that's how um you know Robert Green
[50:34] essentially like studied power he would
[50:35] go and look at old stories old tales and
[50:38] history read autobiographies and things
[50:40] like that and just see how people in
[50:42] power acted and you know how they kind
[50:44] of became in power and um really deeply
[50:47] analyzing that and I think uh it's
[50:49] really interesting in that in that
[50:51] aspect and I I recommend it for
[50:53] sure the one last topic that I really
[50:55] want to get into with with you is uh
[50:58] Bitcoin personal finance there are a lot
[51:00] of interesting uh discussion around that
[51:03] uh when we get into like oh should
[51:06] should I if if I have a bunch of Bitcoin
[51:08] and I have feared uh bills to pay should
[51:11] I sell Bitcoin spend Bitcoin should I
[51:14] get a a loan against Bitcoin uh then
[51:17] there are few people that also get paid
[51:20] in Bitcoin what are they doing so it's
[51:23] like um a huge topic I want to start
[51:26] with one question um when you live on a
[51:29] 100% Bitcoin standard like you have
[51:32] everything in Bitcoin and then there's
[51:34] this like one weird expense coming that
[51:36] you kind of have to deal with uh are you
[51:39] in favor of like spending some of your
[51:41] Bitcoin or getting a Bitcoin backed loan
[51:44] or in general what would you recommend
[51:46] doing on on a personal finance mode yeah
[51:49] so um you know I I think it's
[51:51] interesting it's it's a it depends on
[51:53] like what you're really your goals are
[51:54] and where you're kind of getting to
[51:56] right I think everybody should you know
[51:58] try to encourage the circular Network
[52:00] spend Bitcoin when they can U maybe not
[52:03] you know spend uh maybe have like a
[52:05] stack for saving and a stack for
[52:06] spending that kind of aspect of it um
[52:10] you know I think uh if you're 100%
[52:12] Bitcoin you essentially give yourself no
[52:14] choice right you've got to spend your
[52:15] Bitcoin you've got to pay your bills um
[52:18] you know I think you know bitcoiners in
[52:19] a in a sense you know you could
[52:22] essentially pay for almost anything in
[52:24] Bitcoin uh these days right I mean we've
[52:26] got air BTC where you can you know stay
[52:29] at an Airbnb you've got bit refill
[52:31] places you could buy uh gift cards some
[52:34] other places too where you can buy that
[52:36] I know like in Florida here we've got
[52:39] the beef initiative you can buy um beef
[52:42] and and eggs and things like that um raw
[52:45] milk you know what there's a lot of
[52:46] different things that are are growing
[52:48] and people accept Bitcoin for uh I think
[52:51] you should always encourage those those
[52:52] local people and spend Bitcoin in that
[52:55] but you know I'm not NY I know that you
[52:57] know you're still probably going to need
[52:58] to pay your power bill or your mortgage
[53:01] in Fiat and uh you know those are going
[53:03] to be you know expenses that come out
[53:05] and they're not going away every single
[53:07] month I do think that you know you
[53:09] should uh do that if you're earning in
[53:12] Bitcoin it's great I think you should uh
[53:14] you know spend it and everything like
[53:16] that the one difficult thing in the US
[53:19] and I I think the you know maybe in in
[53:21] Europe too I'm not quite sure all about
[53:24] the laws but the difficult thing in the
[53:26] US is spending
[53:27] Bitcoin it has a lot of tax implications
[53:30] right now so um you know when you go to
[53:33] different places like El Salvador and
[53:35] you know maybe Argentina here soon or
[53:37] other places that have more of these
[53:39] like circular economies I know like you
[53:41] know Bitcoin jungle and Costa Rica and
[53:44] some of these other places I encourage
[53:45] people to spend Bitcoin there you know
[53:47] it is difficult uh in the US and I
[53:50] encourage people to consult a tax
[53:52] professional because I think you know at
[53:54] a certain point the tax man's going to
[53:56] come knocking in the US um they're
[53:59] essentially attacking Bitcoin and they I
[54:02] like to you know they call it choke
[54:03] point 2.0 right they they're attacking
[54:05] Bitcoin in the I guess the self-
[54:08] sovereignty the non- kyc route where you
[54:11] know they're making it very difficult
[54:12] for lightning wallets um to have non kyc
[54:15] so you have kyc like strike or cash app
[54:18] you're sending Bitcoin they're going to
[54:20] have to report it because they're
[54:21] companies and uh you know because
[54:23] they're going to have to report it then
[54:25] you know you're going to have the tax
[54:26] ban basically come knocking on you soon
[54:29] so I think you know spending in the US I
[54:32] encourage it for smaller things uh it's
[54:34] it is very difficult for bigger larger
[54:37] items um and I think it will be tough
[54:40] and be made tougher here um depending on
[54:43] who gets elected too um but I definitely
[54:47] think like you know people should try to
[54:49] live on a Bitcoin standard if they could
[54:50] ride the volatility from month to month
[54:53] of Bitcoin um definitely do that I do
[54:56] think it is a little tougher you know
[54:58] obviously with uh the exchange rate and
[55:01] kind of prices being fixed and whatnot
[55:03] uh here in the US but uh yeah I mean I
[55:07] think people should should do it really
[55:09] works for them s sit in the mirror and
[55:10] kind of evaluate it in that sense um you
[55:13] know I try to live on uh as much of a
[55:15] Bitcoin standard as I possibly can um
[55:17] you know I pay editors and other things
[55:19] like that in Bitcoin and and uh you know
[55:21] I kind of encourage people to try to do
[55:23] that as much as possible but like I said
[55:25] it is uh there is a lot of tax
[55:27] applications in the US to do that for
[55:29] sure absolutely um I heard that a lot
[55:32] never really ask myself that what is
[55:35] choke point
[55:37] 2.0 yeah so they're basically cutting
[55:39] off on-ramps onto onto Bitcoin so like
[55:42] they're making it difficult where um
[55:44] banks are you know if you're uh putting
[55:47] money from your bank you know into uh
[55:51] coinbase or something like that they're
[55:53] kind of flagging that account and uh if
[55:55] you're you know putting a bunch of money
[55:57] in at once say you move 10 grand into
[56:00] coinbase in one day to buy Bitcoin and
[56:02] then you immediately try to take it off
[56:04] they'll flag that immediately um because
[56:06] of what you're trying to do so um
[56:09] they're basically just cutting off
[56:11] onramps into Bitcoin exchanges and uh
[56:14] basically in in my eyes like cutting off
[56:16] the Privacy aspect of it so I think uh
[56:19] you know Bitcoin privacy in the US is is
[56:22] definitely something that's uh it's
[56:24] pretty scary you know I mean we've seen
[56:26] this the samurai guys go down um get
[56:29] arrested telegram CEO got arrested um
[56:32] you know I think a lot of these aspects
[56:34] a lot of these you know quote unquote
[56:36] private ways to move Bitcoin are uh you
[56:40] know under attack for sure and I I think
[56:43] that that will change because more
[56:45] people are going to start to rebel
[56:46] against it and you know I think people
[56:49] are kind of sick of that but um in the
[56:51] short term it is definitely a worry and
[56:53] you need to educate politicians here in
[56:55] the US to to help get away from that for
[56:58] sure yeah absolutely I I I do agree with
[57:01] that a lot really cool perfect then
[57:03] let's come to the end routine uh one
[57:05] question that I always ask my guests
[57:07] what can we learn from you besides all
[57:09] the things that we talked about besides
[57:11] uh
[57:12] Bitcoin yeah I mean I think like one
[57:14] thing to take away you know you you
[57:16] talked about uh spending and you know
[57:19] living on a Bitcoin standard one thing I
[57:21] think that uh you know is still there
[57:23] for a lot of people is the
[57:25] entrepreneurial Spirit um you know I
[57:28] I've been building green candle for a
[57:30] couple years now um but the reason I've
[57:33] been able to do this and hopefully take
[57:35] fulltime here in the next few months um
[57:38] the the reason I've been able to do that
[57:40] is because I worked the Fiat job and I
[57:42] saved in Bitcoin um and then of course
[57:44] that appreciated allowing me to put more
[57:46] money into my business you know over
[57:48] time and you know I think bitcoiners in
[57:51] general really get into that hoddle
[57:54] mentality uh I think you know be afraid
[57:56] to spend your Bitcoin because I think
[57:58] you know investing in yourself at at a
[58:00] certain point in time is is something
[58:02] that everybody should do and it's you
[58:04] know what do you believe in more
[58:05] yourself or Bitcoin and I think
[58:07] everybody should really take a look in
[58:08] the mirror and and really uh you know
[58:10] evaluate that and if you don't believe
[58:12] in yourself buy that more than Bitcoin
[58:14] than why um you know I think everybody
[58:16] should almost have that sense of
[58:17] delusion and uh really try to go for it
[58:20] because I think money always comes back
[58:21] around whether it's Bitcoin or Fiat or
[58:23] whatever it is and so I think everybody
[58:26] should you know really just look at that
[58:28] and you know look at how they want to
[58:30] paint their life and not be afraid to to
[58:32] spend their Bitcoin to help encourage
[58:35] something and to greener pastures of
[58:38] course I'm not saying go to the clubs
[58:39] and buy bottle service with uh with your
[58:41] Bitcoin but you know if you're investing
[58:43] in yourself and investing in a business
[58:46] uh in a way for you to to make your
[58:48] future better I I encourage everybody to
[58:51] do that and and Save in the short term
[58:53] for in Bitcoin and then in the long term
[58:54] invest in yourself and that will just
[58:56] pay off dividends that's a that's a
[58:59] beautiful beautiful learning really
[59:00] really cool uh yeah thank you so much uh
[59:03] for doing it we have now one more tin
[59:05] where the previous guest is asking a
[59:06] question for the next guest without
[59:08] knowing who the next guest actually is
[59:10] um the question from the previous guest
[59:12] for you is how do you orange pill your
[59:15] closest family members they seem to be
[59:18] the the hardest ones to orange
[59:20] pill yeah man that's that's a very tough
[59:22] question because uh I think you know I I
[59:25] think how you can uh orange pum is is
[59:28] just slow and steady man you can't
[59:30] really force it down their throats
[59:31] they're never going to really listen to
[59:33] you um you know I think it's just you
[59:35] got to let them come to them uh let them
[59:37] come to you excuse me and I think um you
[59:40] know people in a sense uh always are a
[59:43] little curious about it um and then just
[59:46] keep growing man like everybody will get
[59:48] curious and then ask you how you did it
[59:50] whatever it is um whether it's getting
[59:52] rich buying I don't know rental
[59:55] properties uh you know quitting your job
[59:57] and traveling the world people always
[59:59] ask you well how did you do that and
[60:01] then you know once they see the results
[60:04] of what you're building yourself
[60:06] everybody will get curious and then
[60:08] that's how they'll kind of start to come
[60:09] to you um and I think that's just with
[60:12] with people in general but more so with
[60:14] the people that are closest to you and I
[60:16] think the people that are closest to you
[60:17] are always going to be watching the
[60:18] closest too so that's where I think um
[60:21] you know that that'll be the way to to
[60:23] orange pill them I I've tried you know
[60:26] gifting Bitcoin I've tried shoving it
[60:28] down their throats I've tried all that
[60:30] stuff and to be honest I just I've given
[60:33] up at this point and I think that's the
[60:34] way that I'm GNA have to go about it now
[60:37] is let them come to
[60:38] me yeah that's I think the most
[60:41] efficient way also I noticed like when
[60:43] you when you're in a group and they know
[60:45] that you're the bitcoiner uh you should
[60:47] never be the the aggressive one pushing
[60:49] it you should always be just like the
[60:51] one that answers questions if there are
[60:53] questions and the funny thing is then
[60:55] after that they come in private with in
[60:58] private chats to you and like hey how is
[61:00] that actually and hey can I buy where
[61:02] can I buy like it's never in a group
[61:04] thing uh and it's it's really just be
[61:06] there for for people if they have
[61:08] questions and the rest will come that's
[61:10] that's a great learning thank you so
[61:11] much yeah 100% yeah definitely resonate
[61:14] with that and I think yeah that's the
[61:16] that's the best way to do it it'll save
[61:17] you a lot of stress and it'll save them
[61:19] a lot of stress absolutely perfect then
