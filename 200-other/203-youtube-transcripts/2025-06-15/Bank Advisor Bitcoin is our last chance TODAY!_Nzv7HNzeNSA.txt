[00:00] they print new money every day if you
[00:02] look at the European balance sheet for
[00:03] the last 3 years you see that they
[00:05] printed $700 billion what I was thinking
[00:08] and what I'm wondering is who has this
[00:10] money when we went there a year before I
[00:12] had the same cart and it was like 120 so
[00:15] I was expecting maybe 150 160 but not
[00:18] 400 or 300 so it's ridiculous I hope we
[00:20] can help to prevent cbdcs to come to
[00:23] life ever the idea behind the digital
[00:26] euro is to become independent from other
[00:28] payment service providers the pricee it
[00:31] comes with is total control the
[00:33] statement of the European Central Bank
[00:35] that the digital euro is not
[00:37] programmable is a straight out lie if
[00:39] you really want to be independent you
[00:41] use Bitcoin that's Superior money they
[00:43] don't want open source they want
[00:44] surveillance tools they don't want you
[00:46] to be free they want to control
[00:47] everything they put on regulations they
[00:49] put on technology they have face
[00:51] recognition they they regulate
[00:53] everything it's like a total disaster in
[00:55] Visa they can do 40,000 maybe or maybe
[00:57] 50,000 whatever now here's the
[00:58] difference if we go step up on a layer
[01:01] two technology which is the lightning uh
[01:03] Network for example we can do more than
[01:05] 40,000 we can do 100,000 we can do a
[01:07] million TPS I take responsibility for my
[01:10] Bitcoin I take responsibility for my
[01:12] life hey I take even responsibility for
[01:14] what I'm
[01:15] [Music]
[01:18] eating you are working uh in a bank
[01:21] you're promoting Bitcoin you're demoting
[01:24] I I say demoting cbdcs you're warning of
[01:27] the dangers you're Orange Building other
[01:29] Banks I think that's that's a great
[01:32] segue into uh the the Bitcoin podcast in
[01:36] general um so like before we start with
[01:38] with topics what are you doing and why
[01:39] are you doing that that's a good
[01:42] question and actually I do not work in a
[01:44] bank I work with banks I'm a consultant
[01:46] to Banks and uh I started um in
[01:50] technology like 40 years ago and uh I'm
[01:55] not a te technologist by myself I just
[01:58] uh do the market sales and I understand
[02:01] technology and I'm always excited about
[02:03] latest technology
[02:05] developments and um a huge part of our
[02:08] clients at the time were network
[02:11] marketing companies people who were
[02:13] selling to the direct sales from one
[02:16] person to the next and there is two kind
[02:19] of these kind of direct marketing one of
[02:22] them is legal and the other one is
[02:23] illegal so the illegals are called the
[02:25] pony schemes and uh the legal ones are
[02:30] um selling like insurances Financial
[02:33] things they um they are selling food
[02:37] supplements and things like that so I
[02:39] was providing technology to these people
[02:42] and one day one of my customers in 2016
[02:45] came along and said hey this Bitcoin
[02:48] that's a pony scheme is it and my
[02:51] initial reaction was of course yeah sure
[02:54] so he needed a uh forensics expert
[02:58] witness statement for a lawsuit and I
[03:01] took on uh the order and we Dove uh deep
[03:06] dived in it and found out Bitcoin is not
[03:09] a pony scheme but we accumulated a lot
[03:12] of knowledge and at the end of the time
[03:15] at the end of the day we had
[03:17] like 2,000 pages of knowledge and I
[03:20] decided to uh repurpose it and publish a
[03:24] book actually the first book in German
[03:26] language and one of many in the English
[03:29] language it was called Bitcoin
[03:30] blockchain and Co the truth nothing but
[03:32] the truth this book was also at the time
[03:35] dealing with blockchain a lot because in
[03:37] 2016 2017 blockchain was the big thing
[03:41] in the meanwhile I H do have a very deep
[03:44] understanding on uh Bitcoin and on
[03:47] blockchain and on crypto and today I'm
[03:50] just promoting Bitcoin because anything
[03:53] else beside crypto beside Bitcoin is
[03:56] crypto is not that secure not that uh
[03:59] immutable like anybody thinks and
[04:02] blockchain is not like the holy cril of
[04:05] the future so there's a lot of reasons
[04:08] why I decided to go only Bitcoin but one
[04:11] of the things what happened in the last
[04:13] three or four years was of course that
[04:15] Facebook started to promote Libra or DM
[04:19] at the end and that was a new currency
[04:22] which Facebook wanted to bring onto the
[04:24] market which pushed up the whole markets
[04:27] of digital currencies now all the
[04:30] central banks got very very scared about
[04:31] that and at the end of the day they just
[04:34] uh prohibited Facebook in doing that and
[04:36] anybody else because they wanted to
[04:38] maintain their
[04:40] Monopoly so like a few years later like
[04:44] in 2020 or so they came to the great
[04:46] idea that they wanted to push out their
[04:48] own version of a digital currency and
[04:51] that is what this they call the Central
[04:53] Bank digital currency
[04:55] cbdcs so I got involved in that by
[04:58] knowledge and found out that this is
[05:00] like the most dangerous thing ever
[05:04] whatever can happen to us in the future
[05:07] and based on
[05:09] my my love to books and my me having fun
[05:13] writing books I also wrote a book about
[05:15] the danger of
[05:16] CBDs and this is where we stand today
[05:19] and I hope we can help to prevent CBDs
[05:23] to come to life ever and I guess this is
[05:27] one of the topics we want to talk to
[05:28] about today right
[05:30] absolutely yeah cbdc is are really
[05:32] interesting um because it's also for me
[05:35] I guest all around the world from from
[05:37] Germany from Africa from America from
[05:39] Australia and uh people from Africa they
[05:43] don't worry about cbdcs at all and
[05:46] people from Europe uh and America and
[05:48] developed countries way more um so like
[05:52] why are why are cbdcs so dangerous well
[05:56] the reason let's look at how they
[05:58] promote the the cbdcs or let's look
[06:02] especially to the digital Euro the
[06:05] European Central Bank is promoting the
[06:07] digital Euro as a tool or a means of
[06:10] being independent from the American
[06:13] payment service providers like
[06:14] MasterCard PayPal and all the others so
[06:18] the idea behind the digital euro is to
[06:20] become independent from other payment
[06:23] service
[06:24] providers which is a good
[06:28] idea if you just take it alone the price
[06:31] it comes with is total
[06:34] control and this is basically H and we
[06:36] can go right to the core of the whole
[06:39] issue the digital Oro by itself and any
[06:42] other zbtc it's the digital dollar or
[06:45] the digital Yen or whatever it is by
[06:48] definition it is a piece of software
[06:50] because it's digital so there's no way
[06:53] cannot be a piece of
[06:55] software and any kind of software which
[06:59] is controlled by a single entity can be
[07:03] reprogrammed in a way that this single
[07:06] entity can benefit the
[07:09] most now if Facebook tomorrow changes
[07:12] the algorithm because they can
[07:15] accelerate sales in advertisement
[07:18] spending they will do so if the European
[07:22] Central Bank
[07:23] tomorrow can benefit controlling
[07:27] people's spending that they can
[07:30] reprogram this digital Euro in a way so
[07:34] that they can achieve their goal really
[07:36] easy the statement of the European
[07:38] Central Bank that the European uh the
[07:41] digital euro is not programmable is a
[07:45] straight out lie and if they can program
[07:48] it they can program it in any kind they
[07:51] like to the disadvantage of
[07:55] everybody and that's basically the core
[07:57] of the issue a lot of people especially
[08:00] in the outside of the Bitcoin world uh
[08:02] tell me like oh like what's what's the
[08:04] the question always comes like oh what's
[08:06] the difference between the Euro that we
[08:08] have now because like most of it is
[08:10] already digital uh and the digital Euro
[08:13] I think like most people outside of the
[08:15] informed Bitcoin crowd are like okay
[08:18] what's what's the difference is because
[08:20] like they already can basically stop a
[08:22] lot of things and they can already do a
[08:24] lot of things but what's the the main
[08:26] difference between the cbdcs that uh
[08:29] Euro uh is planning and right now
[08:31] digital Euro well these are two totally
[08:34] different animals and I do understand
[08:37] that the most people don't understand
[08:38] the difference now if you look at to uh
[08:41] into the currency the the Euro by itself
[08:45] we do have two different kinds of Euros
[08:48] at least two different kinds which
[08:49] anybody knows one is the cash which is
[08:52] the bills and the coins and the other
[08:54] one is our online banking like whatever
[08:58] it is now between these two is a big
[09:01] difference cash is only produced and is
[09:05] only allowed to be produced and can only
[09:07] be produced by the Central Bank European
[09:10] Central Bank so your bank may it be a
[09:15] FKS Bank may be sparas it may be
[09:17] Deutsche Bank commerci bank whatever
[09:18] Bank cannot produce cash they cannot
[09:22] print bills they cannot print or press
[09:25] coins the
[09:27] online version
[09:29] the online banking what you see on your
[09:32] online banking account that is from the
[09:35] bank not from the European Central Bank
[09:38] that's a big
[09:39] difference and the way money comes to
[09:43] life so to speak is created is that the
[09:46] bank is giving you a credit by just
[09:53] putting money onto your account which
[09:55] comes out of the nowhere it's just
[09:57] digital money which is created by the
[10:01] bank and it's put onto your account so
[10:03] you can spend
[10:05] it that's what the how the whole system
[10:08] works but the European Central Bank has
[10:10] no say in whatsoever European Central
[10:13] Bank cannot come to the bank and say hey
[10:16] Robin please give him a million oros or
[10:19] dollars as a credit I can't do it the
[10:22] bank is responsible the bank creates the
[10:24] money and the bank provides it to you or
[10:27] not now with the central Bank digital
[10:30] currency the digital Euro you do not
[10:34] have an account with the bank but you
[10:36] have an account with the European
[10:37] Central Bank and now you talk to the
[10:40] European Central Bank and they provide
[10:42] you the money on a European Central Bank
[10:45] digital Euro account which maybe in the
[10:48] beginning is parallel structure to the
[10:52] bank and you can use that money and you
[10:55] can spend it if they provide it to you
[10:58] if they decide
[10:59] we don't want to provide anything to you
[11:02] we just can take it
[11:03] away so it's a parallel system a paral
[11:07] parallel infrastructure which is one of
[11:10] the the downsides of the whole idea that
[11:13] they have to build up a parallel system
[11:16] which costs billions of Euros to build
[11:18] it up which has extra friction in it
[11:22] which makes the whole thing even more
[11:24] complicated and more
[11:26] sophisticated with no need at all
[11:29] but this is the difference between the
[11:32] digital oo which you do use in your
[11:34] online banking and the digital Euro
[11:37] which is issued as a cbdc from the
[11:39] European Central Bank so they would
[11:42] completely cut out the the commercial
[11:44] Banks and go directly to to the consumer
[11:47] is that why you are uh working for a
[11:52] with a Commercial Bank uh is like the
[11:54] commercial Bank should actually embrace
[11:56] Bitcoin because like the the Fiat system
[11:58] kind of cuts them out now not
[12:01] necessarily I believe everybody should
[12:03] embrace Bitcoin because that's the third
[12:05] or the like the superior money which you
[12:09] can think of and we come let's let's go
[12:12] back to the first statement where I said
[12:14] the European uh Central Bank stated that
[12:16] they want to be independent from these
[12:18] service providers like Master Paypal
[12:21] Mastercard and Visa whatever hey you can
[12:24] be independent right now if you use
[12:26] Bitcoin there's nobody in the world who
[12:28] can control manipulate Bitcoin in any
[12:31] way so if you really want to be
[12:33] independent you use Bitcoin that's the
[12:35] superior Superior money that's Health
[12:37] money healthy money and the reason why I
[12:41] support Bitcoin is because of that I
[12:43] don't even give I don't I don't care
[12:45] about Banks I don't care about uh the
[12:47] European Central Bank if it comes to
[12:49] money I care about immutable ledgers I
[12:52] care about freedom I I care about Open
[12:54] Access I care about uh limited Supply
[12:57] and all those things that's what Bitcoin
[13:00] has however to get this information to
[13:04] the people and where do people have
[13:07] their money at Banks so we need to talk
[13:09] to Banks and we need to educate them and
[13:11] also we need to show them that the
[13:13] digital euro is a huge huge threat to
[13:16] them because at the end of the day
[13:19] European Central Bank will have their
[13:20] customers not the bank you and I will
[13:24] have an account with the European
[13:25] Central Bank so if the European Central
[13:28] Bank tomorrow decides we don't need the
[13:30] banks anymore we just cut them off
[13:33] that's easy done if you have Bitcoin
[13:36] Bitcoin cannot switch off a bank Bitcoin
[13:39] just can add on to the satisfaction of
[13:41] the customers in the bank and if you
[13:44] have a bank which is providing Financial
[13:46] Service and it's for for you helping you
[13:49] to increase your Financial Freedom then
[13:53] Bitcoin should be part of this you
[13:55] should if you want to save money if you
[13:58] want to build your um Fortune you may
[14:01] need to invest in different
[14:02] infrastructures in different assets you
[14:04] may need to invest in in shares you may
[14:06] need to invest in ETFs and things like
[14:08] that but also you should invest today
[14:11] you should also invest a little bit at
[14:13] least in Bitcoin so that's not a threat
[14:16] to the banks it's just an add-on it's a
[14:19] additional tool and additional asset
[14:22] that's the difference between European
[14:23] Central Bank digital money and Bitcoin I
[14:27] think that makes it very clear really
[14:29] cool thank you for that um how how close
[14:31] do you think are we to that cbdc I mean
[14:34] we then have to also look at different
[14:36] countries I think in America where
[14:38] actually like most of the audience is in
[14:40] America as English English speaking um
[14:42] in America they are quite opposed to it
[14:46] at least way more than than the European
[14:49] Zone how is the current landscape and
[14:50] how close are we uh I I wouldn't say the
[14:54] Americans are so much smarter in general
[14:57] but in cbdcs they are very smart
[14:59] way smarter than the Europeans because
[15:02] they just polit political parties and I
[15:04] think it's bipartisan in the United
[15:05] States is that they say no cbdcs they
[15:09] totally understand the control they
[15:11] totally understand the dependence on the
[15:14] fat in the United States if they allow
[15:17] the fat to interact with their lives on
[15:19] a direct way they don't want that
[15:23] Europeans
[15:25] are not that smart in that
[15:29] if you look at it and Europeans also
[15:32] kind
[15:33] of what I think the European Central
[15:35] Bank will do and this shows
[15:38] how what kind of mean Spiel that all is
[15:44] I'm pretty sure they will incentivize if
[15:46] you use the digital Euro for example if
[15:49] you buy something they want you to buy
[15:51] they give you an extra discount so they
[15:53] manipulating people in it and if they do
[15:56] it to over a period of time they
[15:59] eventually it'll come out with a survey
[16:01] which says uh we found out 82% of all
[16:05] payments are now by the digital Euro so
[16:07] we don't need the other payments systems
[16:09] anymore and they just switch over to the
[16:11] digital URI in total that is a
[16:14] manipulation they can do by nudging the
[16:16] people into the digital Euro and uh this
[16:19] is something the Americans just say stop
[16:22] we don't even start that bipartisan
[16:24] politicians fighting against it so
[16:27] there's no way the FED can install this
[16:29] kind of surveillance tool now in other
[16:32] countries around the
[16:34] world it's like some sometimes we are
[16:37] not aware of it sometimes we don't do it
[16:39] sometimes we want to do it all the
[16:43] approaches we did in the past failed
[16:45] miserably because we were done not so
[16:48] smart they didn't work correctly and
[16:52] most important people just didn't use
[16:55] the cbdc they didn't want it they didn't
[16:57] use it however I believe if you have
[17:01] real good marketing behind the cbdc you
[17:04] can make people use it like I said
[17:06] before what probably the European
[17:08] Central Bank will do so the landscape is
[17:11] in general people don't want it because
[17:14] they don't need it everything works fine
[17:17] but if you put a lot of good marketing
[17:19] behind it you definitely can make it
[17:21] happen and you can make it working
[17:23] that's my
[17:24] belief I mean we kind of already saw
[17:27] with uh what was it called World coin
[17:29] where people like scan the IRS for for
[17:33] for some coin it's it's pretty easy
[17:35] to send incentives yeah that's the
[17:38] that's the thing the incentives and what
[17:40] European in the US like like I said
[17:42] there's a No it's it's just a no I mean
[17:45] the difference between the uh United
[17:47] States and Europe is that if you in the
[17:50] US if you say no people are carrying
[17:53] weapons so you shouldn't try it right
[17:55] because they are all they have all
[17:57] weapons in Europe they don't have
[17:59] weapons they have lot a lot of
[18:00] regulations they have a lot of a lot of
[18:02] bureaucracy a lot of uh whatever and
[18:05] it's all killing everything and the
[18:06] whole Europe is is like
[18:09] plowing itself into thousand pieces and
[18:13] then there is this little group of
[18:14] people sitting in the European Central
[18:16] Bank and in other
[18:18] institutions and they know how to Market
[18:20] it right now they are coming out with
[18:23] Communications they tell people why the
[18:26] European uh Central Bank needs to issue
[18:29] cbdc and I haven't heard really really
[18:33] political uh parties or politicians say
[18:35] no they say oh okay yeah no no makes
[18:39] sense yeah no so they are smart they
[18:42] using good Communications and later on
[18:45] they will good use good marketing and at
[18:47] the end of the day they will reinstall
[18:49] or no not reinstall they will establish
[18:52] Orville's
[18:54] 1984 as a regime in Europe so that
[18:57] everybody and anybody is controlled
[19:02] 247 and and that's uh that's a book I
[19:05] think also we we see it in the
[19:06] background that you wrote with 2024 um C
[19:10] can uh can can we be uh oh yeah that's
[19:14] that's really cool the
[19:16] book uh like first of all like what
[19:18] what's the book about for those people
[19:20] that don't know about it yeah people
[19:23] don't know this book but hopefully they
[19:25] know
[19:26] Orville's dystopian novel
[19:30] 1984 now what happens in 1984 um it did
[19:34] happen in the real world before that
[19:38] or's Vision orval's book and he wrote it
[19:41] in 1947 and that was right after second
[19:44] world war that was right after the Nazis
[19:47] installed
[19:48] gestapo which was a military secret
[19:51] police and a lot of people millions of
[19:54] people got killed with all this so under
[19:57] this impression he wrote 19 1984 and in
[20:00] 1984 he Visions a totalitarian
[20:03] surveillance state where you have the
[20:05] big brother and you have all these
[20:07] screens watching at you all the time and
[20:11] he describes the Journey of a person who
[20:15] is working in a system and then is
[20:18] falling in love and he meeting the girl
[20:21] and the name is uh vinston Smith and
[20:24] he's meeting the girl and at the end
[20:27] they catch him because he's against Bri
[20:30] big brother and the whole story doesn't
[20:32] end well for
[20:34] him now what people didn't know at the
[20:36] time and this book then was released as
[20:39] I said
[20:40] 1947 and it was a future was a vision in
[20:43] the future what people didn't know at
[20:45] the time was that Julia his girlfriend
[20:49] in the book was
[20:50] pregnant and at the end of
[20:53] 1984 she gave birth to a
[20:57] boy and in
[20:59] 2024
[21:01] this son of Winston Smith of the name of
[21:05] win was 40 years old was living in the
[21:07] United States in New York he was in
[21:09] banking and he meeting a girl and he
[21:12] comes into a situation where he's also
[21:14] not in alignment with the politics not
[21:16] in alignment with uh what people want
[21:19] him to do so he and his girlfriend then
[21:22] also are escaping like his father did
[21:25] before but this time it's not the
[21:27] screens watching him which are installed
[21:30] all over the place this time it's
[21:32] because we're using
[21:33] cbdcs and the government know exactly
[21:37] where they went what they bought how
[21:40] much they paid for what and this is how
[21:44] we catch them at the end of the day and
[21:46] I don't want to spoil too much of the
[21:47] content also I can say if we allow cbdcs
[21:51] to come true it's not ending very well
[21:56] we will end up in this total Ian
[21:59] surveillance and we need to do
[22:02] everything anything which is legal and
[22:04] everything which is legal to prevent
[22:07] this from becoming
[22:10] true and I wanted to update 1984 with
[22:13] this book uh so that the people have
[22:16] like a
[22:17] more more time realistic
[22:23] scenario and the difference between 1984
[22:26] and this book is that Orville in 19 47
[22:29] had to think about technology how can I
[22:32] surveil how can I have surveillance
[22:34] items on the people on the masses of
[22:36] people so he invented the screens he
[22:39] invented all the stuff now in 2024 in my
[22:42] book I didn't have to invent any
[22:43] technology all what we need is here and
[22:46] this makes it especially dangerous
[22:49] because we don't need to invent any
[22:51] future technology to do that no it's
[22:53] already here and cbdcs it's called cbdcs
[22:57] it can be used
[22:59] almost today so so you're saying that
[23:02] there is a chance even in the European
[23:04] Union that we stop that from happening
[23:07] and what role does Bitcoin play into
[23:10] that well in primarily Bitcoin doesn't
[23:13] play any role at it at all it's just
[23:16] that the Bitcoin people who understand
[23:18] Bitcoin or typically knows a lot about
[23:20] money and understands Financial system
[23:23] so much more than the average person and
[23:26] I'm sure that these people who
[23:28] understand B coin who who think about
[23:30] Financial Freedom and freedom in general
[23:33] will rather early understand the danger
[23:37] and hopefully will spread the message so
[23:39] we can we can
[23:41] definitely uh prohibit it from happening
[23:44] the cbdc digital Euro or any other cbdc
[23:47] happen if the people get up and say no
[23:52] if the people go to their politicians
[23:54] and tell them to say no if the awareness
[23:57] of the danger is risen then it may not
[24:01] happen if we just sit there and if we
[24:03] are just like the Lemmings we just
[24:05] follow each other and jump over the
[24:07] cliffs then it's going to we will end
[24:11] it's not it's not funny so we need to
[24:14] get up we need to talk to the people we
[24:16] need to talk to politicians and we need
[24:18] to do anything in our power anything
[24:21] legal to prohibit that and I think
[24:24] bitcoiners in general because we're more
[24:26] conscious about the subject
[24:29] can do a lot more than average Joe who
[24:32] doesn't understand who just lives day
[24:36] today that's why I'm talking to
[24:38] bitcoiners so uh so many
[24:41] times H that's uh that that's very true
[24:45] and what for for me it's always
[24:48] interesting um like cbdcs and Bitcoin
[24:50] that's like covers the money part um is
[24:53] there another part to it with maybe
[24:55] social media and big Tech with a general
[24:57] war on privacy when we see like or even
[25:00] open source developers being imprisoned
[25:02] and stuff like that is is that the is
[25:04] that another part to do the same thing
[25:07] basically of course of course I mean I I
[25:11] typically say there is a way to
[25:12] implement and install um cbdcs and there
[25:16] is two prere requisites to a cbdc number
[25:20] one is open source and number two is
[25:23] 100% privacy that means uh zero
[25:26] knowledge technology built in it and
[25:29] only if I see an open source that this
[25:32] is a uh a software which I can use
[25:36] because it has all the prere requisites
[25:38] and all the requirements then I may be
[25:40] able to use it and then I may able to
[25:43] use it and then I may use it
[25:46] however it also needs to have several
[25:49] other technology features which is like
[25:51] open not only open source but it needs
[25:54] to be open it needs to be immutable so
[25:57] that nobody can manip at and it needs to
[25:59] be free and a lot of other features and
[26:02] if you list all these features and you
[26:05] summarize them up you have
[26:08] Bitcoin so it doesn't make any sense to
[26:11] build a system which is already existing
[26:15] you can save billions of dollars and
[26:16] billions of Euros if you just use
[26:19] Bitcoin and then you have the same thing
[26:24] just better more freedom and immutable
[26:28] and all these features now that's not
[26:30] what state nation states wants nation
[26:33] states want control and in European
[26:36] European Union it's even worse this is
[26:39] like the super nation states the EU it's
[26:42] not the Germans Italians or the French
[26:44] or the Spanish it's the EU there's a
[26:46] group of people who try to get in total
[26:49] control and total power and of course we
[26:52] control open source they don't want open
[26:54] source they don't want uh um
[26:57] surveillance tools well I mean they want
[26:59] surveillance tools they don't want you
[27:00] to be free they want to control
[27:02] everything they put on regulations they
[27:04] put on technology they have face
[27:06] recognition they they regulate
[27:08] everything it's like a total disaster
[27:10] and it all gets in the same thing how do
[27:12] I get total control and this is exactly
[27:15] what we don't want and where we need to
[27:17] fight against as much as we can that's
[27:20] really interesting does it do do you
[27:22] think does it come down to either BTC or
[27:26] cbdc or might be like a hybrid system I
[27:29] mean now we have already a kind of
[27:32] feared Bitcoin hybrid system but does it
[27:35] come down to either that or that or can
[27:38] we have long-term even a hybrid system I
[27:40] do believe we will have a hybrid system
[27:42] uh the next 10 maybe 20 years or
[27:44] whatever it's very very difficult to uh
[27:47] Pro give a prognosis for the future
[27:50] here one of the things we need to solve
[27:52] in Bitcoin is the payment like how can I
[27:56] pay with Bitcoin that's one of the
[27:57] things we can we need a solve and this
[28:00] is also one of the areas I'm pretty much
[28:03] investigating and working on because
[28:05] here's the thing if people from the
[28:09] typical standard Financial system from
[28:11] the Fiat system comes along and says
[28:12] yeah but you can't use Bitcoin as a
[28:14] payment system because it only only can
[28:16] do five to seven transactions per second
[28:19] they are right the blockchain can only
[28:21] do the Bitcoin blockchain can only do
[28:23] five to seven transactions per second
[28:25] and Visa they can do 40,000 Maybe or
[28:28] maybe 50,000 whatever now here's the
[28:30] difference if we go one step up on a
[28:33] layer two uh T technology which is the
[28:37] lightning uh Network for example we can
[28:40] do more than 40,000 we can do 100,000 we
[28:42] can do a million TPS that's no problem
[28:44] we just need to build it the difference
[28:47] is then if Visa master or whoever it is
[28:50] wants to go from 40 to 50,000 they need
[28:53] to build a huge huge new uh server uh
[28:58] environment we need to put in tens of
[29:00] thousands of computers to go from linear
[29:03] from 40 to 50 to 60 each time we need a
[29:06] new uh computer system deployed big huge
[29:10] farms server Farms everything now with
[29:13] lightning we have not a uh linear scale
[29:18] we have an exponential scale means it's
[29:21] like very simple to understand if you
[29:23] look at the network effect if you have a
[29:25] fax look at back at the fax machines we
[29:27] had one fax machine one guy had one fax
[29:29] machine was worth nothing so when was
[29:32] another guy like you and me and we could
[29:34] send faxes from me to you and you could
[29:36] Fox back but if we have the third person
[29:39] we have so much more ways to communicate
[29:42] because then we can talk to I can talk
[29:43] to you I can talk to the third person
[29:45] the third person can talk to you and the
[29:46] third person can talk to me so each each
[29:51] uh note in the network is adding extra
[29:55] more communication channels and that's
[29:58] the difference between linear scaling
[29:59] and exponential scaling which we have in
[30:02] in lightning so what I hope what we can
[30:05] achieve is more lightning noes more
[30:08] better lightning clients better
[30:09] lightning technology and one of the
[30:11] things I'm really excited at the moment
[30:13] I'm investigating very very deeply is a
[30:16] way where you can pay with lightning
[30:19] with Satoshi on the lightning Network
[30:22] and for the merchant it gets transferred
[30:25] directly into his fiat currency and this
[30:28] is something I want to roll out I want
[30:30] to help rolling out I hope and this is
[30:32] also why I do talk to Banks because
[30:34] banks are the bankers of the merchants
[30:38] of course so if now the bank today the
[30:40] bank is going to the merchant and say
[30:42] here here's my payment terminal for Visa
[30:44] Master whatever it is and tomorrow we
[30:46] should go and say Here's a payment
[30:48] terminal which also allows you to accept
[30:50] Bitcoin and you don't have any risk
[30:53] because Bitcoin is volatile if you look
[30:55] from the Fiat system from the Euro from
[30:57] the dollar to the system it is volatile
[31:00] but dear Merchant don't worry about that
[31:03] because we are exchanging directly into
[31:06] Euros or dollars or whatever you have on
[31:08] your regular Fiat account and the only
[31:11] difference is you get the payment
[31:14] immediately and you don't have any call
[31:17] backs you don't have any chargebacks and
[31:20] it's so much more cheaper than any of
[31:22] the Visas and and this is the way where
[31:24] we get independent from the Visa master
[31:27] and any other payment provider not only
[31:30] the Europeans but everybody it's cheaper
[31:33] it's final sale and it's in real time
[31:37] and if you can achieve that and I think
[31:39] we are the beginning to roll that out
[31:41] and I think we are the beginning to have
[31:43] that deployed worldwide then we don't
[31:46] need to make any other system and we
[31:49] don't even need the established Fiat
[31:51] system anymore in very short period of
[31:54] time maybe 10 maybe 15 maybe 20 years if
[31:57] you can't get rid of the ground then we
[32:00] need another technical solution to get
[32:02] rid of the ground if you watch my
[32:04] podcast already for more than two times
[32:06] you know how extremely passionate I am
[32:09] about self- custody and the first very
[32:12] very very important step to self custody
[32:15] is always getting yourself a hardware
[32:19] wallet and I have one for you here this
[32:21] is the Bitcoin only Edition from the
[32:24] bitbox my favorite single signature
[32:26] Hardware wallet on on the market another
[32:29] really important piece of self- custody
[32:32] if you have a hardware wallet is the
[32:34] backup of the seed phrase and bitbox
[32:37] made the perfect solution to back up
[32:39] your seat phrase they made a reusable
[32:42] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[32:45] durable and extremely heavy if I put it
[32:48] on the desk I seriously feel for my own
[32:52] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[32:55] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[32:58] secure go to bitbox
[33:01] Doss robobin to get your bitbox and if
[33:04] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[33:09] of your complete order and the next step
[33:12] is to really level up your sovy as an
[33:14] individual you have to have the most
[33:17] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:19] secure your own devices you have to
[33:22] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:25] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:27] where you live you even want to have a
[33:30] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:33] in case something goes really really
[33:34] wrong and through all those steps the
[33:36] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:39] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:42] way.com
[33:43] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[33:46] minute free call to find out how you can
[33:49] level up your sovereignty and last but
[33:52] not least I have something completely
[33:54] new for you guys I partnered up with
[33:58] coin vigilante this is the most
[34:00] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:03] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:06] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:09] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[34:12] perfect subtle elent way to go out there
[34:15] and show that you are a bitcoiner and
[34:18] that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[34:21] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[34:24] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:28] watch collections you have the date of
[34:30] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[34:33] there and of course also the block
[34:35] height and which EPO we are currently in
[34:39] I love the level of detail they put in
[34:42] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:44] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:47] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[34:50] love those watches so so much and it's
[34:53] really interesting because a lot of
[34:55] people Overlook Bitcoin as a p payment
[34:58] uh Network because Bitcoin is a payment
[35:00] Network and an asset so like there's
[35:03] there's both sides to it and and I think
[35:04] the payment Network a lot of people just
[35:07] Overlook and don't really look at it uh
[35:09] and not pay attention to it so that's
[35:11] that's a a really good point there do
[35:14] you think we need maybe additional
[35:15] layers even above that if we really want
[35:17] to go mainstreams I I definitely uh
[35:21] think we need because if you have this
[35:23] first you have the Bitcoin blockchain
[35:25] which is an immutable ler which is like
[35:28] the main layer which is like the stable
[35:30] and secure and immutable base the
[35:34] foundation for everything and then you
[35:36] have the payment rails on top of that
[35:38] which is currently the lightning uh
[35:41] system but then also you want to have
[35:43] some services on top of that maybe some
[35:46] what they call Smart contracts like auto
[35:49] payments and things like that that may
[35:51] be a third layer maybe it's integrated
[35:54] to a certain part in the second layer
[35:56] but maybe it's on top of of the third
[35:58] layer maybe it's the fourth layer maybe
[35:59] we have a lot of layers and that's okay
[36:02] because if you look at the financial
[36:03] system today you see that there is a
[36:06] foundation and then you have a layer one
[36:08] another layer layer layer layer and they
[36:09] have like 80 or 90 or 100 or 200 layers
[36:13] the problem with that is that the
[36:14] foundation is built on zand or on a
[36:17] swamp land not on a real strong
[36:20] foundation and this is why the bloody
[36:24] system always crashes this is why we
[36:26] lose our
[36:28] uh our savings this is why we have to
[36:30] pay every year more and more and more
[36:32] for the same products this is how the
[36:35] financial system is built a Fiat system
[36:38] it's built on Sand or swampland now with
[36:41] Bitcoin we have this rocket we have this
[36:44] this 100% safe and secure and immutable
[36:47] base layer and we build on top of that
[36:50] throughout the next uh 100 years and it
[36:54] doesn't matter it doesn't matter how
[36:55] many technology you put on top of it as
[36:58] long as the base layer strong enough to
[37:00] support it you can do
[37:02] anything there's one component to it for
[37:05] me that's when we talk about why gold
[37:08] kind of kind of failed because it like
[37:10] you needed to uh issue IUS to like
[37:13] actually use it as a payment Network yes
[37:15] with Bitcoin you don't need it uh
[37:18] because you can put it in in layers and
[37:20] and you can uh transact Bitcoin directly
[37:23] overseas like I got the first uh like
[37:27] one of my sponsors is in America and
[37:28] they actually pay me in in Bitcoin which
[37:30] is amazing experience because payment
[37:33] from America to Austria it's a headache
[37:36] if it's not a Bitcoin it's like same
[37:40] same as here um but how how important in
[37:44] that whole process is self custody
[37:47] because I think sometimes I fear that
[37:50] people hold their Bitcoin in exchange
[37:52] and if if that gets mainstream and
[37:54] nobody holds their own Bitcoin then we
[37:56] essentially have gold
[37:59] again well let me let me Ju Just talk a
[38:02] little bit about
[38:03] gold all we want in Bitcoin or all we
[38:06] can do in Bitcoin some people claim they
[38:08] can do in gold and this is a big big big
[38:12] mistake because the difference between
[38:14] Bitcoin and gold is in the
[38:17] mining so if you want to mine gold you
[38:20] need to go into the Earth and you need
[38:23] to dig holes and you need to extract
[38:25] gold out of this mines right now this is
[38:29] a very centralized process so some
[38:32] people can do that because they have the
[38:34] technology they have the knowledge they
[38:36] have the money and so on and so on what
[38:38] happen if they dig in the in the earth
[38:41] they find gold and then it's going like
[38:45] let's say one 100 kilos of gold is in
[38:48] this particular mine and it's going to
[38:51] an end they already have dug up like 89
[38:55] kilos out of 100 but now all of a sudden
[38:57] they find another big chunk of gold
[39:02] right next to the mine which has another
[39:05] 100 kilos and this is exactly the
[39:08] difference now they look at the market
[39:09] and say okay before we just sell of all
[39:12] our Reserves at the high price before we
[39:15] announc that we found another 100 kilos
[39:18] because that may be an inflation to the
[39:20] gold price yeah so they manipulate this
[39:23] markets and that is on the base layer
[39:25] that's not even on the IUS and on all
[39:27] this all certificates on top that's on
[39:30] the base layer so there's a manipulation
[39:32] on the base layer this is not with
[39:34] Bitcoin you can't manipulate this
[39:37] Bitcoin Supply because every 10 minutes
[39:40] currently you get
[39:42] 1.3 uh uh 3.125 Bitcoins every 10
[39:47] minutes so every day you have 450 new
[39:51] Bitcoins there is no way you can change
[39:54] that if you are in gold mining you can
[39:57] manipulate a lot if you're in Bitcoin
[40:00] you can't do it so that's a huge
[40:01] difference between gold and Bitcoin and
[40:04] the other uh system of course is how do
[40:06] you pay like uh a piece of bread like 20
[40:10] cents or 15 cents with gold how do I
[40:14] know that the gold I get is real gold I
[40:16] don't have the capacity I don't have the
[40:18] abilities to do that but I know exactly
[40:22] that if I have six confirmations on the
[40:24] blockchain that now the Bitcoin nobody
[40:26] can take away my Bitcoin anymore and
[40:29] this comes back to what you were asking
[40:31] if I have it on an exchange so if I give
[40:34] my Bitcoin to somebody else he can run
[40:36] off with
[40:37] it and I shouldn't do that it's pretty
[40:41] much the same when I go to the bank and
[40:43] ask for buying gold and give it to them
[40:47] to uh store it they give me a piece of
[40:50] paper or digital piece receipt digital
[40:53] receipt and say now you we owe you now
[40:57] 100 gr of gold and then I go there and
[41:00] say hey give me the 100 gr of gold and
[41:02] they say um I can't do that because
[41:04] there's a regulation here and whatever
[41:07] reason or have it just ran off so
[41:10] anytime you do have your assets in
[41:13] custody of somebody else with somebody
[41:16] else can just run off or just they don't
[41:21] give it to you so it's always always
[41:23] always very important to have it in
[41:24] self- custody could that be a systemic
[41:28] risk for for Bitcoin or is the
[41:30] possibility to take it in self custody
[41:32] this exit wealth enough even if like 90%
[41:35] of people don't have it there what do
[41:37] you mean by systemic risk for me it's
[41:38] like when when Bitcoin uh becomes
[41:42] mainstream and uh we we don't succeed in
[41:45] educating people in getting them into
[41:47] self custody and they all hold it on
[41:50] Exchange um then it's like oh is is that
[41:53] actually Bitcoin or can the the
[41:55] exchanges then play with the numbers uh
[41:57] to a certain extent um I think not like
[42:00] I think that the risk is not there but
[42:02] it's it's interesting to to think about
[42:05] that if that might happen because I know
[42:07] friends that are big time in the Bitcoin
[42:10] but they still are like I trust the bank
[42:12] I trust that like is it could self cussy
[42:17] not being mainstream be a a big risk for
[42:20] for Bitcoin as as the mission not for
[42:23] Bitcoin but for the users of course I
[42:26] mean anytime and and we see that uh if
[42:29] you if you look around you you saw at
[42:32] 2008 you saw Leman PR and all the other
[42:34] Banks cheating on the customers big time
[42:37] uh you saw it in in in Germany
[42:39] especially and it may have uh had waves
[42:42] around the world with a company called
[42:44] vard they had like2 billion dollar on
[42:47] their accounts or $2.9 billion dollar on
[42:50] their accounts this 2.9 billion never
[42:53] existed never existed just a fraud it
[42:55] was plan out fraud you s Bernie Bernie
[42:58] Med you saw you saw a lot of uh fraud in
[43:02] the financial system I mean huge this is
[43:05] where we don't talk about like uh 250 CR
[43:08] we talk about $250 billion doar or
[43:10] something like that and this is because
[43:13] Banks and financial institutions and
[43:17] actors in the financial world are just
[43:19] cheating just betraying people badly and
[43:22] of course if they have custody of your
[43:25] Bitcoin they can do anything with your
[43:27] Bitcoin they can tell you uh you have it
[43:31] and in reality they just send it off to
[43:33] somebody else you don't have any control
[43:35] they can steal they can betray they can
[43:37] cheat on you get do anything this is why
[43:40] you should have your gold and should
[43:41] have your Bitcoins at home of course
[43:44] there's a risk on the other hand which
[43:46] is with gold if I know you have gold at
[43:48] home and I talk to my buddy and said
[43:50] let's go there and take the gold away so
[43:53] this is a risk with Bitcoin this is also
[43:56] a risk to a certain extent but there's a
[43:58] lot of measurements cheap measurements
[44:01] you can do to prevent this from
[44:04] happening like one of the things is like
[44:06] a multi sick which is a few hundred
[44:09] dollars investment but if you have like
[44:11] 10 grand or 100 Grand or even more
[44:14] that's a very good investment so you
[44:15] don't need to buy a huge safe or a
[44:19] safety box for tens of thousands to uh
[44:22] store your gold if you have Bitcoin just
[44:25] have digital
[44:27] measurements cheap and very very secure
[44:31] and yes you should do that you should
[44:33] think about it it's your responsibility
[44:35] that's the difference between Bitcoin
[44:36] and and the financial system we know is
[44:40] hey they do it they take care of it I
[44:43] trust them I don't I take responsibility
[44:46] for my Bitcoin I take responsibility for
[44:49] my life hey I take even responsibility
[44:51] for what I'm eating because I want to be
[44:54] healthy for the rest of my life and if I
[44:56] go go to the grocery and eat all this
[44:59] industrial processed food I'm pretty
[45:01] sure that I get sick so it has to do
[45:04] with self-conscious it have to do with
[45:06] self
[45:07] uh with uh responsibility and this is a
[45:11] world we need to yeah we need to move to
[45:14] in order to stay happy and healthy
[45:16] really really cool what do what role do
[45:19] you see Banks uh take in in the future
[45:23] where in in the Bitcoin world do do
[45:25] banks have like a service where they
[45:28] just help people uh on board the M or
[45:30] even like something like Unchained or
[45:32] CLE doing with collaborative custody and
[45:35] what is the future role of of banks in a
[45:37] Bitcoin
[45:37] World well if if you look at the banks
[45:40] their mission the core mission of the uh
[45:43] like Community Banks especially like in
[45:46] in Europe the sparas and folks bank and
[45:48] and Savings and Loans in the United
[45:49] States and things like that they're just
[45:51] the financial partner of the customers
[45:55] and they provide Financial services and
[45:57] that's not limited to uh credit that's
[46:00] also helping them to uh make decisions
[46:03] about asset allocations things like that
[46:06] of course to provide payment services of
[46:09] course to provide liquidity and all
[46:10] those things and this won't change if
[46:13] instead of the dollar or the Euro they
[46:16] now do it for Bitcoin it's a different
[46:20] way of doing it it's a different
[46:22] technology but the service at its core
[46:25] is still the same I be your person
[46:28] helping you with your financial duties
[46:31] and financial uh services and this is
[46:35] why the bank I uh I am working with and
[46:39] uh consult this is exactly their
[46:42] statement they say we invest bank is 130
[46:45] years next year they they will be 130
[46:48] years and they say we had so many
[46:50] different currencies last 130 years we
[46:53] didn't have the Euro all 130 years we
[46:55] had the deut Mark we had Mark we had a
[46:57] lot of other
[46:59] currencies but that's not what we do
[47:01] what we do is we help our customers in
[47:04] financial uh belongings in financial
[47:07] services in financial requests that's
[47:10] what we do and Bitcoin is a part of it
[47:13] and if you as a bank if you look at it
[47:16] like that then Bitcoin is just a natural
[47:18] thing what what they need to embrace and
[47:21] and the credit thing that you said just
[47:22] uh reminded me uh of what we briefly
[47:26] talked before we recorded what you said
[47:29] like you said it so nicely that we're
[47:31] expanding our balance sheets the
[47:33] monetary policy right now so much what
[47:36] what's your thoughts around that yeah
[47:39] this is one of the things I discovered
[47:40] lately um I mean we all talk about that
[47:44] we have inflation right I was recently
[47:48] in a in a um supermarket in Miami uh
[47:52] Florida and I I I was just I came to
[47:55] Miami and I went to a supermarket uh
[47:58] Grocery and there was a guy in front of
[48:00] me and I I I stacked my cart there was a
[48:04] guy in front of me had like a little
[48:05] more in his card but not really more and
[48:08] he pushed it to the cashier at the end
[48:10] of the
[48:11] cashier a lady at the cashia said it's
[48:14] $440 please and I was like
[48:17] what and I was literally pulling my card
[48:22] out of the chain out of the queue I was
[48:24] sitting it aside was talking to my wife
[48:26] and I said listen that guy just said 440
[48:29] I do not expect this to be more than 150
[48:32] and she was like you're kidding me this
[48:34] is at least 300 I was like let's let's
[48:36] have a look now anyway what happened is
[48:39] that when we went there a year before I
[48:41] had the same card like same full and it
[48:45] was like
[48:47] 120 130 so I was expecting maybe 150 160
[48:51] but not 400 or 300 so it's ridiculous so
[48:55] this is inflation very bad and the
[48:58] question is where does it come from now
[49:00] we do have a belief and we have a lot of
[49:01] evidence for that that is because they
[49:04] print new money every day we print they
[49:08] they print all the time now and this
[49:11] brought me to a point where I was
[49:12] thinking I said okay let's have a look
[49:14] at the central bank balance sheet the
[49:16] fat or the Europeans or the English
[49:18] doesn't matter and you see a major
[49:21] increase in the uh in the money supply
[49:25] in the last like three or four years
[49:27] especially after covid it just went up
[49:30] like crazy I mean it was always climbing
[49:32] but now it went up crazy so if you look
[49:35] at the European balance sheet for the
[49:36] last three years you see that they
[49:38] printed $700
[49:42] billion $700
[49:44] billion now they flooded the market with
[49:48] 700 billion new uh oros of course not
[49:52] dollars oros the FED they also printed a
[49:55] lot maybe even more I don't have the
[49:57] number right now what I was thinking and
[50:00] what I'm wondering
[50:01] is who has this
[50:04] money because Robin I mean we we are
[50:07] clear on that you don't have it and I
[50:10] don't have it and everybody listening
[50:12] outside to this podcast you don't have
[50:15] it either so the question really is who
[50:17] has it who in the world has his
[50:20] 700
[50:23] billion and I want you to go to your
[50:25] politician I want you to ask your
[50:27] politician any level of polit politics
[50:31] who has this $700 billion or oros who
[50:35] has it that is the critical question we
[50:38] need to ask here and this brings us to a
[50:41] point where people are probably more
[50:43] conscious about money this is what I
[50:46] what I love to achieve is that people
[50:48] think about what what is this money and
[50:50] how come that there is 700 billion
[50:53] nobody in the world knows who who has it
[50:55] probably the rich
[50:58] however if you think about it then you
[51:01] need to think about it what is this
[51:03] digital dollar digital Euro this cpdc is
[51:06] that really good no it's not just start
[51:09] thinking about money and is there an
[51:10] alternative do we have good money do we
[51:12] have healthy money as you call it sound
[51:15] money and you will find Bitcoin so going
[51:19] out and talk to people and ask them do
[51:22] you have this $700 billion because I
[51:24] don't and if you don't who has it that's
[51:27] maybe an entry to get people more
[51:30] conscious about the danger of cbdcs
[51:32] about the rotten Financial system the
[51:34] Fiat system and introduced to bitcoin
[51:38] which is sound money which is something
[51:41] we should embrace and we can because the
[51:44] technology is there we just need to use
[51:46] it and build it further and just engage
[51:49] with
[51:50] it so we actually don't know at all
[51:55] where where this this money flow like
[51:57] the this this balance sheet expansion
[51:59] that's not like documented where like in
[52:02] in what sectors they they're doing it or
[52:05] kind of it is but I don't know anybody
[52:08] who would be able to duck dig into it
[52:11] and find out exactly where it is I mean
[52:14] if you just look at the balance sheet of
[52:16] a of a nation state like a small one
[52:19] like I don't know Croatia or Serbia or
[52:22] Finland or any kind of smaller ones not
[52:25] to talk about the EU U balance sheet or
[52:27] the FED balance sheet so much money but
[52:30] it's
[52:31] significant more money in the last four
[52:34] years when anytime ever
[52:37] before and you see all the scandals the
[52:40] little scandals like oh there is a
[52:42] million this guy cheated the politics
[52:45] he's a politician he cheated for
[52:47] 350,000 we had that like that's nothing
[52:51] that's just nothing against $700 billion
[52:54] dollar or Euros in that case it's like
[52:58] 700 billion e that is 700 million
[53:03] million euros think about it if you
[53:06] don't have it I don't have it let's find
[53:08] out who has it ask your politician let's
[53:10] see how we get an answer and if not
[53:12] think about what we should do and embra
[53:17] Bitcoin yeah that's that's a great great
[53:19] story uh and a great um question to to
[53:23] begin with like I always try to when
[53:25] when someone ask me like oh uh what is
[53:29] bitcoin and why is it important I first
[53:31] asked them or what do you think about
[53:33] inflation that's always my entry point
[53:35] to to get someone before because on
[53:38] depending on his answer I maybe don't
[53:42] speak about Bitcoin the next like two
[53:43] three hours and maybe have to start
[53:45] talking about the monetary policy before
[53:47] we even get into the Bitcoin topics
[53:50] right and and this is what I I think
[53:52] this is a great shortcut because I don't
[53:54] want to explain anybody the money monary
[53:56] system it's way too complicated I can
[53:58] talk hours about a monetary system and
[54:01] and I did it's like Central Central um
[54:05] bank money where is like bank money
[54:07] where is like debt where is like
[54:09] obligations there's like a ton of I mean
[54:11] all these layers built on Sand right is
[54:14] all there and it's all just to height
[54:17] but at the core where are the
[54:20] 700 billion euros and it's 700 million
[54:23] pounds in US and I don't even know how
[54:25] much it is in the in in England and I
[54:27] don't even know how much it is in the in
[54:30] the US probably much more so who has
[54:33] this money that's the core question and
[54:36] if you don't if you can't answer it
[54:37] think about it maybe we need to talk
[54:39] about what kind of money
[54:42] is more transparent more open more
[54:46] reliable what kind of system is
[54:49] immutable where can't they cheat and all
[54:52] roads lead to bitcoin at the end of the
[54:55] day how do you expect that to to
[54:57] continue will they ex implode in at some
[55:01] point the financial system well there
[55:04] will be a big Scandal there will be a
[55:07] huge huge huge crash like 2008 and
[55:11] 2011 the the difference or the time
[55:14] difference between the crashes will
[55:16] shorten but they will save it they will
[55:19] try to save the system they will keep on
[55:21] doing it because listen there's millions
[55:24] of people making a lot of a lot a lot of
[55:27] money doing all this Fiat doing all this
[55:31] Fiat system yeah I I don't want to go in
[55:35] in bad words I mean they just do it they
[55:38] have like they find new financial
[55:40] instruments today and tomorrow and then
[55:42] they have another one they pack
[55:44] instruments together and have a third
[55:45] one and it's just a big big big scheme
[55:49] this is the pony scheme by by the way
[55:51] this is the Bony scheme not Bitcoin so
[55:55] if the whole system would go away
[55:58] millions of people who makes a lot of
[56:00] money will be out of business they lose
[56:03] everything why would they do that and
[56:06] one of the ways they can maintain the
[56:09] system is or not not one of the
[56:12] ways what they need to maintain this
[56:14] fraud system this Pony scheme they need
[56:17] more
[56:19] control and this is where we come back
[56:21] to the beginning if you have cbdas you
[56:24] have better control and more control and
[56:26] you can maintain the sponsy scheme even
[56:29] longer eventually it will explode but
[56:32] hey we had that before not in the US in
[56:35] the last 100 years but in Europe how
[56:37] many different currencies we had just in
[56:40] Germany where we where I'm sitting right
[56:42] now we had like four currencies in 100
[56:45] years and that is just to have control
[56:48] to control the people and to maintain
[56:50] the fraudlent pony scheme longer so it
[56:55] will not load it will just a bump it
[56:58] will be a very bumpy road in the future
[57:00] very
[57:01] bumpy yeah it's it's it's I uh I had
[57:05] Ariel on a few weeks ago where he talked
[57:07] about uh the Argentina history of money
[57:10] and this was like oh there's like a
[57:12] currency it lived for like two years
[57:14] then there was the next one it lived for
[57:15] four years and I like yeah it's like
[57:18] they hyperinflate and then they just
[57:19] make a new one that's like yeah when you
[57:21] look at Argentina or turkey apparently
[57:24] even with a very high inflation rate
[57:27] people don't flu to bitcoin all at once
[57:31] the the pain is just like I don't know
[57:33] how how high the pain has to go that
[57:36] people actually like oh yeah like I need
[57:38] to see a serious
[57:40] solution it's fascinating for me and and
[57:43] and this is why I'm promoting this where
[57:45] of the 700 billions because people don't
[57:48] care about financial system people don't
[57:50] care about what they eat as long as it's
[57:51] convenient right but what people care
[57:54] about is if they being Tre it
[57:58] unfair and if somebody pocket $700
[58:01] billion and you don't have it and I
[58:03] don't have it and everybody else don't
[58:05] have it then I I become
[58:08] pissed I'll be pissed because these
[58:12] people take $700 billion and I'm not
[58:14] part of it and now I want to do
[58:16] something and this is I believe the way
[58:18] to go instead of trying to educate them
[58:22] before on money and all they don't even
[58:24] care but they care about being treated
[58:27] very unfair compared to the others
[58:29] personal Bel I don't know if I'm right
[58:31] but this is what I
[58:33] believe yeah I I think it's uh very
[58:37] logical it's interesting um we have an
[58:40] end routine in the podcast where the
[58:41] first question is always the same uh
[58:43] question for every guest um and the
[58:46] question is what can we learn from you
[58:48] besides all the things that we already
[58:50] talked
[58:51] about uh stay curious all the time I
[58:54] love that one that's a that's a good one
[58:56] perfect then let's come to the end
[58:58] routine of the podcast where the
[58:59] previous guest is asking a question for
[59:01] the next guest without knowing who the
[59:04] next guest actually is the question for
[59:06] you is what is the most interesting
[59:08] rabbit hole which Bitcoin took you down
[59:12] that is not
[59:13] Bitcoin Financial system I had no idea
[59:17] about financial system I was just one of
[59:19] his limings jumping off the cliffs until
[59:22] I got introduced to bitcoin and I was
[59:24] like what is a what is money I mean what
[59:27] is money and what is a currency is that
[59:30] the same thing no it's not and what is
[59:32] central bank money and what is bank
[59:34] money and what is depth and that was a
[59:37] totally new universe for me and I
[59:40] mastered it I mastered it so much more
[59:43] than most of the bankers I talk to I can
[59:45] I can if I talk to a banker I can ask
[59:47] him three questions and he's out of he
[59:50] doesn't want to talk to me anymore
[59:52] because he knows now oh I'm such I don't
[59:54] have any idea about what's going on
[59:56] so that's one rabbit hole and I'm still
[60:00] deeping uh digging deeper because I'd be
[60:04] very curious do you did you already work
[60:06] in B with banks uh before Bitcoin no no
[60:10] no no I just got introduced I introduced
[60:12] Bitcoin to the bank and now I understand
[60:15] Banks I I wasn't even attached to the
[60:18] financial system at all beside being
[60:20] user and beside being cheated by many
[60:24] Financial people but uh no no I just got
[60:27] in it and and also there is a lot of
[60:29] nuances in the system like the Community
[60:32] Banks saving loans and things like that
[60:34] in Europe and in us and so a lot of uh
[60:37] difference between this Regional Banks
[60:39] and big Banks uh Regional banks are so
[60:42] much more urban the history like in that
[60:46] bank I'm Consulting mostly they have
[60:48] customers in the thir Generations where
[60:51] CR grandfather was a customer of the
[60:54] bank and Bank helped them at the time in
[60:56] agriculture and now they're helping in
[60:58] building his his other businesses so
[61:02] totally different them from the the big
[61:04] Banks like uh Wall Street Banks who
[61:07] are much more remote from the customer
[61:10] and just looking at the numbers instead
[61:13] of the people so you can learn in the
[61:15] financial system can learn a lot about
[61:18] psychology a lot about people and this
[61:21] was new for me yeah perfect and before I
[61:25] let you go uh where can people find you
[61:27] and reach out to you yeah the most
[61:30] important thing is Joe Martin
[61:34] BTC so in almost all CH channels you
[61:38] find me on Joe Martin
[61:41] BTC like YouTube and any other if you
[61:45] want to be more precise in German you
[61:47] find me on my German Twitter uh which is
[61:50] Joe Martin de for deut de but any else
[61:56] just Joe Martin BTC don't look for don't
[62:00] look for Joe Martin so many Joe Martins
[62:02] out there you need to go for Joe Martin
[62:03] BTC or Jo Martin de that's
[62:06] important yeah I always do like half an
[62:09] hour of research before with the guest
[62:11] and I was also like just typing in uh
[62:14] Joe Martin I was like oh there's a lot
[62:16] of things popping up that's not the CH
[62:18] Martin I searing but if you type in ch
[62:21] Martin and Bitcoin in Google and all the
[62:23] platforms then you actually most likely
[62:26] find you like at least at YouTube and
[62:28] Google then you were popping up with the
[62:31] keyword Bitcoin to it perfect then thank
[62:34] you so much Joo for being on thank you
[62:36] so much also for everyone that was
[62:37] listening and watching to this as always
