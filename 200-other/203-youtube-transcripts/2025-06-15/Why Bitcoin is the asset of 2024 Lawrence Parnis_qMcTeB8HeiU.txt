[00:00] they don't take money out of circulation
[00:01] they just make more it's like a tax that
[00:03] nobody sees lar saying that Bitcoin is a
[00:06] flight for quality but it's actually a
[00:08] flight for safety away from feeld away
[00:10] from cbdcs away from all this madness
[00:13] going on stack sets before the end of
[00:15] January hard as you
[00:17] can why did you came into Bitcoin in the
[00:20] first place I got into Bitcoin properly
[00:23] in 2020 I missed years ago we were
[00:26] playing around with this my friends were
[00:28] in front of me and they were buying
[00:32] Bitcoin uh years ago when it was like
[00:35] $30 but I didn't do my homework on it
[00:39] and I just said it's not for me I missed
[00:42] it again about $100 as well and said it
[00:45] wasn't for
[00:46] me uh in 2020 my brother told me about
[00:50] having hadn't done my homework on it and
[00:53] I missed that 5K Bitcoin or five and a
[00:55] half thousand Bitcoin yeah hadn't done
[00:59] my homework
[01:02] uh but I really got into this really
[01:05] properly like kind at the end of
[01:07] 20120 when I understood first of all uh
[01:11] my background is for a long time of
[01:14] special events I doing a lot of event
[01:16] management uh we've been doing that we
[01:18] have a business over here for 27 years
[01:20] doing Special Events and but I also was
[01:23] involved in a in an IT company a data
[01:28] company that it's started I found it and
[01:32] that was going very well uh and the
[01:34] government closed us down as we all know
[01:36] in 2020 everything was closed down
[01:38] special events was closed down concerts
[01:41] outdoor events everything was all closed
[01:42] down and in Ireland we were hit very a
[01:45] lot harder in other countries it was
[01:47] actually close down for about 18
[01:49] months uh but what it gave me was time
[01:52] to really go in and start work in my
[01:55] other business that I had and uh doing a
[01:58] bit of research the stange thing about
[02:00] it is in 2019 towards the end of 2019 we
[02:04] started getting data about something
[02:06] that was
[02:07] coming uh something big uh we didn't
[02:11] actually know exactly what it was but in
[02:12] February fine we knew what it was then
[02:16] okay and as we seen the whole thing was
[02:19] the whole world spoke down think IR was
[02:21] one of the first countries to stop fls
[02:24] coming in to the country in March uh P
[02:29] day parades with was was canceled over
[02:31] here the first time ever in the history
[02:34] of Ireland things started to change that
[02:37] time so gave me a lot of time because my
[02:41] main business was closed down to when
[02:42] and start
[02:44] learning and uh somebody introduced me
[02:46] to
[02:47] cryptocurrencies I went down that road
[02:50] first like a lot of us did don't get me
[02:52] wrong I did make a few bit out of it you
[02:55] know I did yeah make money out of it
[02:58] which was good and then I I said to okay
[03:02] I've got a good return on this maybe I
[03:03] should come in and start learning a
[03:04] little bit more about this yeah I'm
[03:07] spending a lot of time and energy with
[03:09] the events business I I had been
[03:12] before and maybe I should do something a
[03:15] bit more
[03:16] smarter so that's when I uh started
[03:19] learning a little bit more as I said I
[03:22] missed the last having of BU pay Bitcoin
[03:25] because I didn't understand what Bitcoin
[03:27] was and I didn't even understand that we
[03:28] could buy a piece of Bitcoin like the
[03:31] Tois uh I didn't know that there was 100
[03:35] Millions Tois in a Bitcoin
[03:39] yeah did you thought this you need to
[03:41] buy one bit whole
[03:43] Bitcoin I thought I would have had to
[03:45] buy a whole Bitcoin exactly like most
[03:48] people still do think that and that's
[03:50] why people are focused on the price and
[03:51] they they say oh well I can't afford I
[03:53] can't afford it uh
[03:56] but I started bit bu Bitcoin when was 50
[04:01] $2,000 that's how long it took me to C
[04:04] onto this on 5K
[04:10] basically yeah every goes down their own
[04:13] journey of it yeah but but but the thing
[04:16] about it is once I started buying it and
[04:18] I started realizing what it was
[04:21] uh the more work I done on it the more I
[04:26] started understanding about it you know
[04:28] and and initially at the again they're
[04:30] saying well how how could this be made
[04:32] like we heard about Satoshi we we know
[04:36] we disappeared like in 20110 in early
[04:39] 2010 uh at the end of
[04:43] 2009
[04:45] uh How could somebody a human being make
[04:48] something like this and just leave it to
[04:49] the world I just couldn't understand
[04:51] that and a lot of people still don't
[04:54] understand that until you do your
[04:56] work H it's also unbelievable story if
[05:01] uh someone created something and they
[05:03] just leave after such a short amount of
[05:06] time and the thing actually lives on
[05:09] usually if a Founder leaves a company in
[05:11] such a short amount of time the company
[05:14] probably dies if he doesn't have someone
[05:16] following up really good but the idea
[05:19] was just so brilliant that people
[05:21] catched on to it and just wanted to
[05:22] follow through with of it that's a
[05:24] beautiful thing yeah it is a beautiful
[05:26] thing and that's probably one of the
[05:28] reasons why way it kept on gr as well
[05:31] because no human controlled it you know
[05:35] nobody was in was wasn't totally in
[05:38] charge of it yeah H it was there for the
[05:41] people it was left for the people and
[05:44] thank God some good people uh started
[05:47] working on it and look what it's grown
[05:51] gr to now it's a monster that cannot be
[05:54] stopped it cannot be stopped you nation
[05:57] states cannot stop this you
[06:00] know uh but I think that's what a lot of
[06:04] people have to get their head around you
[06:06] know that it was created by somebody or
[06:09] something or some entity or
[06:12] something yeah we just don't know people
[06:15] are just
[06:16] speculating we created it and to a
[06:19] certain extent it does not even matter
[06:22] because it's all open source it's all
[06:24] verifiable you can look it up you can
[06:27] all like you can every step of the way
[06:30] you can verify it and look through it
[06:33] and can tell yourself like I hear this a
[06:36] lot on on Twitter and people are like oh
[06:38] but this Creed and NSA and stuff like
[06:41] that I'm like okay but point me to the
[06:44] point where it's wrong like point me to
[06:47] the to the vulnerability of Bitcoin and
[06:50] there's nothing coming because there is
[06:51] not not such a thing um what is bitcoin
[06:56] for you I think you describe it as a
[06:58] savings
[07:02] technology yeah yeah definitely yeah for
[07:04] me what I see it as and what I see a lot
[07:08] of people should be seeing it as for
[07:09] themselves personally know leave aside
[07:11] the institutions and the big
[07:13] corporations and all this but every
[07:15] single man woman or child out there this
[07:19] is the most advanced savings technology
[07:22] that was ever given to
[07:25] mankind ever ever
[07:28] created yeah and people need to
[07:30] understand that and they will only
[07:32] understand that if they put in the hours
[07:34] to learn about it and if they put in the
[07:37] hours they will will be rewarded over
[07:39] time with the growth of their
[07:43] satoshis yeah I you can see in the
[07:46] future people will not be talking about
[07:48] Bitcoin they will be talking about
[07:50] Satoshi like say maybe eight or 10 years
[07:53] time that's where it's
[07:55] going yeah it's already started a little
[07:58] bit um more and more people are starting
[08:00] to look not at Bitcoin they're looking
[08:02] at satoshis some wallets are giving you
[08:05] the option to not look at the Bitcoin
[08:08] value but of the Satoshi value and it's
[08:09] really good um was this the reason that
[08:13] you saw it as a saving technology that
[08:15] you're also uh now the host of I think
[08:18] the biggest Bitcoin conference in
[08:20] Ireland can I say that yeah yeah yeah
[08:24] yeah we started that two years ago and
[08:28] uh
[08:30] actually 2022 with our first meeting
[08:33] that we had it just came up as an idea
[08:34] between me and the co-founder a friend
[08:37] of mine uh we just saying let's get a
[08:40] few people to meet up H it started off
[08:44] like as a meet up with the 30 people all
[08:46] of a sudden it was full then we said
[08:48] then I said okay let's do 50 people that
[08:51] filled up then 80 people and it just
[08:52] went on and on yeah and the first the
[08:55] first IM the first meeting that we had
[08:57] was like 200 people at the event just
[09:01] through our connections and through
[09:03] people that wanted to learn and then
[09:05] this year again in 2023 we had it and
[09:07] the the event grew uh at least 50% more
[09:11] in the first year well next year we're
[09:13] going to have a bigger event it's called
[09:16] Uh
[09:18] the Bitcoin uh Ireland conference it's
[09:22] the biggest conference in in Ireland for
[09:25] Bitcoin um we have it's it goes on for
[09:29] the whole day in the future we will have
[09:31] it for like a a weekend one but we're
[09:34] happy keeping it what it is for the time
[09:36] being but it's growing every year it's
[09:38] growing growing and growing growing yeah
[09:41] but at least more than 50% growth on
[09:44] every year which
[09:46] is it's so fascinating that bitcoiners
[09:50] in the space is so motivated to do so
[09:52] much even though for me it's sound money
[09:55] and for me the definition of sound money
[09:57] is not something you have to f f for
[10:00] because it will be uh successful anyway
[10:04] like it cannot be stopped like why are
[10:08] we doing the extra work even though we
[10:11] know it's some money we could just sit
[10:14] back and relax and say I know Bitcoin
[10:17] will be some money I can focus my time
[10:19] on something else and just see my stacks
[10:21] growing and seeing the adoption growing
[10:25] um why do you think people like you and
[10:29] people have so much motivation to put in
[10:32] Bitcoin uh more than just buying it I
[10:36] think what it is once we understand it
[10:39] and once we know about it we need to
[10:41] just spread the word about it to try and
[10:43] help other people that's what it is
[10:45] really for me I'm trying to help other
[10:47] people that just don't get it yet and
[10:50] they don't understand what's really
[10:52] going on and in 2020 how I really got
[10:57] into Bitcoin was when
[11:00] uh I think I I heard about it a few
[11:04] times before but what really nailed it
[11:05] for me when I seen that tooker Carlson
[11:08] and Michael sailor interview in 2020 and
[11:12] he explained about what was really going
[11:13] on with our money how our money is being
[11:16] devalued H normally it was being
[11:18] devalued by about 7 to 10% in the US and
[11:21] in America the Americans have the world
[11:25] Reserve currency they've got the most
[11:26] powerful currency so if the Americans
[11:29] were going down 7% to 10% what was
[11:32] Europe going down we were worse you know
[11:35] I think we're Tre down so it's I think
[11:37] it's the dollar then it's the Sterling
[11:38] then it's the Euro yeah H and if I was
[11:42] going to lose 20% of my wealth that I
[11:44] had worked for for the last 48 years all
[11:48] my savings in one year I had to do
[11:51] something to protect my
[11:54] family and if I didn't and if I didn't
[11:57] shame on me
[12:00] it's like a giant melting Ice Cube I
[12:03] also like the picture that michelo Drew
[12:06] from the beginning it's like a melting
[12:08] Ice Cube you're just seeing it melting
[12:11] small faster and faster but but but the
[12:14] thing about is it's slow for us here in
[12:16] Europe and in America imagine you're in
[12:18] a country like Argentina and you're
[12:20] losing 100 100 110% per year devaluation
[12:24] on your currency if you're in turkey and
[12:26] you're losing about 40% per year
[12:29] you know then you really feel
[12:31] it but I think we're going to start
[12:34] really feeling it now coming into the
[12:36] future yeah what's about to happen and
[12:39] how they're going to keep on Printing
[12:41] and printing and printing and it was
[12:44] just it was so interesting I was in a
[12:45] coffee shop there during the week and I
[12:47] was sitting down beside this man and he
[12:49] looked like a fairly affluent man and we
[12:51] were talking and the guy behind the
[12:52] counter knows me from coming in and I
[12:55] was sitting like at the bar the coffee
[12:56] bar and uh the guy behind the counter
[12:59] was kind
[13:00] of teasing me saying to me are you still
[13:03] into that Bitcoin stuff you know how's
[13:05] that going here and I said yeah well I
[13:07] offer to show you I offer to do you a
[13:10] zoom with you you know it'll change your
[13:12] life once you understand what's really
[13:13] going on and he said I have no money put
[13:16] put into that I said but you can buy 10
[13:18] EUR Worth or 50 worth every week you
[13:21] need to start learning about it and
[13:23] really understand that if you're leaving
[13:25] your money in Euros or dollars on feia
[13:29] currency you're actually getting four by
[13:30] a month because the government is behind
[13:32] their back printing all this money
[13:35] that's the first thing you need to get
[13:37] that aha moment or that lifeold moment
[13:40] and then you need to make a plan for
[13:42] yourself how you going to protect your
[13:44] family and the the man was sitting
[13:47] beside me and all says oh yeah but sure
[13:48] the government has to print money don't
[13:50] they they have to take excess cash in
[13:52] the bad notes and print new on and I
[13:56] like what I said this guy looks as if he
[13:59] has money but he just hasn't done his
[14:01] work on what is money and just doesn't
[14:04] understand when the government or the
[14:06] European Central Bank prints extra money
[14:09] they don't take money out of circulation
[14:11] they just make
[14:13] more they basically take the money from
[14:17] everybody else because the money is
[14:18] going to be devalued it's like a tax
[14:21] that nobody
[14:22] sees yeah exactly but but but this man
[14:26] was trying to tell me that
[14:29] uh they take in all the notes and then
[14:32] that money is actually taken out of the
[14:34] system it's not taken out of the system
[14:36] and could explain that to
[14:39] him you know we can't help everybody as
[14:43] we all say we can only do so much you
[14:46] know yeah but but education is so key I
[14:49] see it all the time with with with
[14:51] simple stuff that you don't need to have
[14:54] a full Bitcoin that the Bitcoin price
[14:57] itself does not mean it's expensive you
[15:00] have to look at the whole asset what's
[15:01] the whole asset worth uh to to put it in
[15:05] perspective what do you think is the
[15:07] most misunderstood Bitcoin property or
[15:10] the biggest misconception that the
[15:13] mainstream media the normal people have
[15:16] about Bitcoin and how can we tackle that
[15:19] yeah I I think one of the main
[15:21] misconception about it is that the
[15:24] electricity goes up that your Bitcoins
[15:27] gone six somebody at the weekend only
[15:29] said that to me again what about the
[15:31] electricity goes off and I said to her
[15:33] if the electricity goes off we have a
[15:35] lot more to worry about having Bitcoin
[15:37] and as the internet goes up we have a
[15:39] lot more to worry about
[15:42] Bitcoin oh so the there's a thing that
[15:46] like oh what's happened and this is
[15:49] interesting for me because I think even
[15:51] if we have outages and shortages with
[15:55] electricity or the
[15:56] internet Bitcoin will be the last thing
[16:00] that breaks down because it's so
[16:02] decentralized the banking system all the
[16:05] other systems we have in place that
[16:08] require internet or electricity will be
[16:11] out first yeah because it just needs it
[16:15] just needs like one two laptops where
[16:17] it's still running yeah and this whole
[16:20] system can be rebuilt and everything is
[16:22] still there and as you said if you if
[16:26] there's no electricity for a long period
[16:28] of time on the whole world we have other
[16:30] problems then you need to be in shape
[16:33] maybe a gun and I don't know what else
[16:37] yeah we're gonna have a lot lot lot more
[16:39] problems if if if the electricity goes
[16:42] down and the internet goes down so I'm
[16:44] not worried about that to be
[16:46] honest yes that's happening and hey if
[16:50] it goes down in my country I'm out of
[16:53] here I can bring my Assets in the world
[16:56] people don't understand you can't move
[16:57] your house you can't move move your gold
[16:59] try moving your silver to the airport
[17:02] right I can take this was also
[17:03] interesting in the uh in the in the war
[17:06] of Ukraine I saw a lot of people and a
[17:09] lot more interest in Ukraine about
[17:11] Bitcoin because bit Bitcoin you can
[17:14] actually get out of the uh system or
[17:17] even with donations to political parties
[17:20] they that they are getting
[17:23] um with with Bitcoin so like there's a
[17:26] lot a lot use cases for that
[17:28] um so you have megar dental uh as you we
[17:33] can see also on your T-shirt uh you are
[17:37] the host of the irel and Bitcoin
[17:39] conference you do a lot of Entre
[17:41] entrepreneurial and business stuff and
[17:44] you also have this this kind of mindset
[17:45] you're not this only on the paper so
[17:48] what do you think is like in the Bitcoin
[17:51] sphere the the in the Bitcoin ecosystem
[17:54] the biggest uh businesses that that will
[17:57] arrive is it the exchanges because they
[18:00] have to uh adopt they have to onboard
[18:03] the people is it some lightning Network
[18:05] what do you see in the development the
[18:07] whole Bitcoin ecosystem yeah there's a
[18:10] lot coming there's a lot coming you I
[18:13] see the base layer of
[18:15] Bitcoin uh like the internet and then
[18:18] Layer Two is are like Google Facebook
[18:20] Instagram all these other company that
[18:22] that came along right so because we're
[18:25] buying the base layer right not the ETF
[18:28] just the Bas the real Bitcoin the value
[18:31] of these new companies when they become
[18:34] unicorn companies or billion dollar
[18:36] companies yeah the value of them is
[18:38] going to automatically go into the base
[18:40] L that's what I can see and so that's
[18:43] why for the last year and a half I've
[18:45] been stacking as hard as I can to buy as
[18:48] much as I can yeah to own the base there
[18:51] and then in the future maybe maybe in
[18:53] three or four years when we can't buy
[18:55] the base there because I I do believe
[18:58] you know once this ETF hits a lot of
[19:01] people are out of buying
[19:05] Bitcoin what do you mean with out of
[19:07] buying
[19:08] Bitcoin because I can see the price
[19:10] going so high once these institutions
[19:13] get involved in it yeah uh regarding
[19:17] this ETF right we've got 12 companies
[19:19] now at the moment like the Black Rock
[19:21] Fidelity H Aran bestest we can name them
[19:24] loads of them they that are getting
[19:26] ready to launch this ETF right and sell
[19:29] the
[19:30] ETF uh I think as well there was a new
[19:32] video put out there by bitwise was it
[19:35] one of the one of the companies that has
[19:36] a a pending ETF approval there's a new
[19:40] video that's Happ coming out I only seen
[19:42] it there today uh just just briefly H
[19:46] it's an advertising video Google as well
[19:49] is after changing the terms and
[19:50] conditions behind the scenes that most
[19:52] people don't know that uh institutions
[19:55] and these big funds with it to start
[19:57] advertising
[19:58] about
[20:00] Bitcoin have the game changer that only
[20:02] happened in the last say 10 days that
[20:04] the terms and conditions
[20:06] changed
[20:08] uh and uh yeah there there's there's
[20:11] like out of those 12 companies they're
[20:13] managing about $ 202 trillion doar of uh
[20:17] assets yeah uh Black Rock is the biggest
[20:21] one uh 20 trillion you take 1% of that
[20:25] we're talking about 200
[20:27] billion probably going to be coming
[20:30] into uh Bitcoin in the first
[20:34] year right at uh at at the moment
[20:39] there's about 25 million being spent
[20:41] approximately about that a day on
[20:44] bitcoin right so people people need to
[20:47] just do the maths yeah even if they put
[20:50] 50 billion in in the first year divided
[20:54] by the amount of days and and and see
[20:56] how much they have to spend to start
[20:59] buying the
[21:01] Bitcoin yeah it's going to go to about
[21:03] 150 million probably minimum a day that
[21:06] going to start spending so of course
[21:08] that's going to cause uh it's a supply
[21:10] and demand you know it's it's
[21:12] mathematics yeah it's it's not really
[21:15] complicated that people are trying to
[21:18] make it out that it's really
[21:19] complicated yeah it's really simple M
[21:23] yeah uh and people say like 21 million
[21:27] coins there not 21 million coins plus
[21:29] the
[21:30] maximum coins that are out there there's
[21:32] 19.6 million coins made out of those is
[21:35] about 3 a half million that people
[21:37] cannot get access to because they lost
[21:38] probably big Fe so we have about 16
[21:41] million approximately coins every those
[21:44] 16 million there's about 75% that have
[21:46] been taken off the exchanges that
[21:48] haven't moved for one year and about 58%
[21:51] that have been moved for two
[21:53] years yeah so on the exchanges there
[21:55] only about 1.8 million
[21:58] coins on the exchanges that these people
[22:00] can actually
[22:01] buy yeah if you work out a price of
[22:04] about 50,000 would just say on average
[22:07] per
[22:09] coin
[22:11] yeah 200 billion is going to eat that
[22:13] 1.8 million points very very
[22:17] quickly so what do you see as a price
[22:20] range possibility for end of
[22:24] 2024 listen from what I can see this is
[22:26] gone into hundreds of thousands
[22:29] that's what I can see Supply demand the
[22:32] volume of money that's going to come in
[22:34] the institutions are coming
[22:36] in so basically you're saying the next
[22:41] few weeks or months is the last chance
[22:44] to get Bitcoin under 100K I
[22:48] think before the end of January people
[22:52] need to get in after that it's going to
[22:54] start going up and up and up and up and
[22:56] up and up I I I can see
[22:59] now I I don't like coming out there with
[23:00] figures
[23:02] but to me it's a no-brainer really it's
[23:06] a no-brainer yeah Supply demand the
[23:09] volume that's coming in the people that
[23:11] are coming in this a whole new different
[23:13] type of people are coming into this you
[23:15] know most bitcoiners are buying like a
[23:17] grand a day you know I mean 10 grand a
[23:19] day or whatever these people are coming
[23:21] in to buy hundreds of millions if not
[23:23] billions per
[23:26] day and graes thing they are not there's
[23:30] not one there's like 5 10 20 and maybe
[23:35] in the future even more and they're all
[23:37] competing that they the investors are
[23:41] investing their money with them so they
[23:43] will advertise as bitwise as you said it
[23:46] uh they will make marketing events they
[23:48] will make a lot of uh Investments even
[23:52] outside of the just putting in money in
[23:55] Bitcoin but outside of the the whole
[23:58] sphere this will bring a lot of eyeballs
[24:00] and attention to bitcoin as I think also
[24:04] yeah the whole narrative is going to
[24:05] change from the mainstream media next
[24:08] year right let's let's think about this
[24:11] logically right Bitcoin controls I mean
[24:14] Black Rock controls all the media they
[24:16] control everything they control all the
[24:19] top corporations in the world okay now
[24:23] next year I can see the news changing
[24:25] the papers changing on their Outlook
[24:27] about Bitcoin because Black Rock owns
[24:30] the
[24:31] papers they own them they own everything
[24:35] so the news channels as well Black Rock
[24:38] owns the news
[24:39] channels so it's going to come from the
[24:41] very top listen guys Bitcoin is good now
[24:44] we're in you need to change your
[24:46] attitude on
[24:47] bitcoin that attitude is going to change
[24:50] very fast that's what I can see but
[24:53] maybe and I think a lot of people that
[24:54] have done their work as well can see
[24:56] that oh we're gonna
[25:00] see that's crazy to think about what do
[25:03] you think is the like why are they those
[25:07] guys now coming
[25:09] in for what did they wait to coming now
[25:15] why did they do it five years ago why
[25:17] are not they not doing it in five years
[25:19] like what did change in your opinion I
[25:22] think a lot of people are
[25:25] uh any Maybe did not see last year black
[25:30] rock created a bitco a black rock
[25:33] private
[25:34] fund okay private fund and in that
[25:39] private fund they were buying Bitcoin so
[25:41] I think that they were buying it already
[25:43] they I think they've been buying for the
[25:45] last maybe year or two okay and they've
[25:48] got this special software that they have
[25:50] uh Aladdin isn't this black rock has
[25:55] it's it's an analytic software that they
[25:56] use to put numers and figures and all
[25:58] into it and I think they've had that Flo
[26:01] into that fund and they've been running
[26:02] their numbers for at least the last year
[26:05] on it and now they totally understand it
[26:07] and I say they have floors of people
[26:10] working on this whole team of people
[26:12] working on this behind the scenes uh uh
[26:17] they've been in for a while they've done
[26:19] their homework they know they can't
[26:21] leave this any longer but regarding
[26:23] institutions not coming in themselves I
[26:26] just don't think there was the mechanism
[26:27] there for them to buy large volumes of
[26:30] Bitcoin you know they weren't going to
[26:32] trust the likes of FTX they weren't
[26:36] going to trust the LI of these exchanges
[26:38] but they trust Black Rock they trust
[26:41] Fidelity they trust all these uh bond
[26:44] that they have the money in there
[26:45] already yeah anybody that that that that
[26:49] that is that have ETFs already they have
[26:53] the money in the basket already so now
[26:56] they just need to move it from one
[26:57] basket like a gold basket maybe 1% out
[27:00] of there into a Bitcoin ETF basket it's
[27:03] going to be so easy for them to move
[27:05] this money whereas before trying to take
[27:09] the money out of there move it on the
[27:11] coinbase you know that takes days they
[27:14] don't have the money's going to arrive
[27:16] blah blah blah know me it was just too
[27:19] difficult for them before but with these
[27:21] ETS is going to be so easy for the
[27:23] institutions to just click and move it
[27:27] are they going to be
[27:30] doing what do you
[27:32] see when they are coming in with so much
[27:34] capital and they are acquiring a lot of
[27:37] Bitcoin and a lot of people are also
[27:39] going to invest with them and they're
[27:41] bringing so uh the mainstream on it
[27:43] they're bring the newspaper on it how do
[27:45] you see or how do you respond to uh
[27:48] someone saying it's a threat to bitcoin
[27:51] they trying to take it over they're
[27:53] trying to make their own Fork they're
[27:55] trying to do some something with the
[27:58] protocol something with Bitcoin um that
[28:01] might be uh dangerous to its uh core
[28:06] principle because blackr is not not
[28:09] usually not known for doing uh Freedom
[28:13] money yes no is it is a great Point H I
[28:19] think it'll help the
[28:20] adoption that's what I think it's G to
[28:22] help
[28:23] adoption H more people are going to
[28:26] carear about it they're gonna feed about
[28:28] the good side of Bitcoin because as I
[28:30] said the the the the the news is going
[28:32] to change about all that
[28:35] uh it's going to be good yeah for a lot
[28:39] of things like and at the end of the day
[28:42] as I said before there's on there's less
[28:44] than 1.8 million uh coins on the
[28:48] exchange right and here's something as
[28:50] well okay I don't think most people
[28:53] realize this I can see black rock being
[28:56] probably the biggest is holder of
[28:59] Bitcoin in a year or or 18
[29:04] months once the ETF launches the biggest
[29:07] holder of Bitcoin in the world so who is
[29:12] the biggest holder Bitcoin at the moment
[29:14] Robin satosi Black Rock want be the
[29:17] biggest all the time they are capable of
[29:20] doing it they coming in with all this
[29:22] money women those all their
[29:24] friends uh I can see them having over a
[29:27] coins probably in a year year and a half
[29:30] and they well capable to doing
[29:32] this that's
[29:34] crazy blackrook actually pulls it off to
[29:38] buy a million coins because when they're
[29:41] buying it and the news is even now
[29:44] getting out that they are even buying it
[29:46] now they have the spot Bitcoin ETF like
[29:49] the price is going to shoot up so
[29:53] quickly uh that they have to pay so much
[29:57] to get those Bitcoins in but it's a it's
[30:00] a rise of of adoption like it's a rise
[30:02] of accumulation because there is only
[30:04] maximum of 21 million we talked about it
[30:07] before maybe it's even like under 20
[30:10] under 15 million maybe like who knows
[30:14] how many Bitcoin I lost uh so will be
[30:17] interesting to see the the option I
[30:18] think I have no clue what's going on
[30:21] next year I think there's a lot more
[30:23] adoption coming and lot more positive
[30:24] news a lot more of events a lot more
[30:26] money coming in I think it will be crazy
[30:29] to see um one interesting question one
[30:34] last interesting question Robin let's go
[30:36] back to that point right there's not 21
[30:39] million that's the maximum cap but that
[30:42] 21 million would only hitting 2138 when
[30:45] most of us be
[30:47] gone okay that's how long it's going to
[30:49] take to mine the rest of the Bitcoin at
[30:51] the moment it's what's on the exchanges
[30:54] is approximately 1.8 million or less on
[30:57] the exchanges that's what these
[30:59] institutions are going in to be
[31:02] buying 1.8 million
[31:05] coins that's the number people really
[31:07] need to be looking at do you think
[31:09] blacko can actually pull it off to buy
[31:11] basically all of
[31:13] them I think myself in the next 18
[31:16] months I think they're going to be the
[31:17] biggest Bitcoin holder out there they're
[31:20] going to come in I can I can see what's
[31:21] going to happen in the on the first
[31:24] couple of days when this launches okay
[31:27] at the moment we've been on looking at
[31:29] Michael sailor and he's brilliant you
[31:31] know I love all his content I love the
[31:32] way he talks everything that he explains
[31:34] about they these people are going to be
[31:36] coming in and they're going to be buying
[31:37] what Michael sailor has accumulated in
[31:39] the last two years in in one
[31:43] day that's what I can see
[31:45] happening in one day like 150,000 coins
[31:49] being bought Boom the next day more the
[31:51] next day why did they not experiment
[31:55] with any altcoins
[31:58] black
[32:01] rug I think maybe in the
[32:03] future you be surprised they probably
[32:06] have experimented behind the scenes and
[32:08] done things themselves behind the scenes
[32:10] they ran the numbers they've done
[32:11] everything but I can see in the future
[32:13] as well maybe a an ETF for ethereum but
[32:18] the danger with the ethereum one is when
[32:20] they done that split there earlier on
[32:22] this year and they fored it h it gave
[32:24] the power into people that own most
[32:27] coins for the network so if that's the
[32:30] case black Rock's going to come in and
[32:31] just going to buy as much as they can
[32:33] and just totally control ethereum and I
[32:36] think that's a lot a lot of these
[32:37] ethereum people don't see that they're
[32:39] so powerful and so big that they can
[32:41] come
[32:42] in take over the ethereum network but
[32:46] they do the same thing with with the
[32:48] Bitcoin
[32:49] Network yeah that's the that's the thing
[32:52] uh with all the altcoins because if in
[32:55] any altcoin Black Rock comes in they
[32:58] control the network
[33:02] immediately they they are just the
[33:03] biggest stacker they're the biggest
[33:05] holder they they control the narrative
[33:07] they control everything Bitcoin is the
[33:09] only thing that's black rock proof would
[33:12] I I would say that actually just they're
[33:15] just contributing to the adoption but
[33:19] not to any control
[33:22] whatsoever yeah did did you experiment
[33:25] with altcoins
[33:28] I did in the early days I did yeah yeah
[33:31] uh and I let my lessel you know like
[33:36] like probably a lot of people doing with
[33:37] with Tera Leona you we all got wrecked
[33:40] in 36 hours there's no
[33:44] hope there's no hope of saving yourself
[33:47] because it went down so fast so
[33:49] quickly uh but I learned my
[33:52] lesson I dusted myself off and kept on
[33:55] going and I said there is some something
[33:57] here you know and then I just started
[33:59] learning more and more and more about
[34:00] Bitcoin that's it I'm just all Bitcoin I
[34:02] haven't bought anything else and any
[34:03] those alt coins I I have some from
[34:05] before but as soon as the price goes up
[34:07] I'm getting rid of them I'm out of
[34:10] there will be Bitcoin um completely
[34:14] replacing uh the Fiat system I don't
[34:17] know if it completely replace it could
[34:19] do in maybe 20 years maybe you know but
[34:22] but see a lot of people a lot a lot of
[34:25] people don't understand this well
[34:27] there's a new type of money coming
[34:29] there's a digital currency coming
[34:32] cbdc right so that's different actually
[34:35] to the Fiat system yeah because Fiat is
[34:38] one system this new system is coming uh
[34:42] I I read an article there from the bank
[34:44] of international settlements last year
[34:46] it was about the
[34:48] cbdcs H and they want every Central Bank
[34:51] in the world to have a fully functional
[34:53] cbdc by the 1st of January
[34:55] 2025 when I first started hearing about
[34:58] cbdcs I thought it would be like
[35:01] 2030 maybe that they might launch but I
[35:05] don't think so you know I think they're
[35:07] coming a lot lot sooner than most people
[35:09] think and I think like next year when
[35:12] people start cing on that maybe D cbdc
[35:15] is a reality we'll see a lot more people
[35:18] turning towards Bitcoin as well FL for
[35:20] safety that's what I see Bitcoin it's a
[35:23] Floy for
[35:25] safety yeah I saw the video of Larry
[35:28] think uh saying that Bitcoin is a flight
[35:31] for
[35:32] Quality uh but it's actually I think
[35:34] also a flight for safety away from feed
[35:37] away from cbdcs away from all this mad
[35:40] Madness going on when he couldn't really
[35:43] say if flight for safety could he
[35:45] because there people to say safety what
[35:47] what's coming he couldn't get into that
[35:49] discussion and panic
[35:51] everybody but if if he's saying it's a
[35:55] flight for quality
[35:57] it's kind of he's saying it's a flight
[36:00] for safety it's of course he is exactly
[36:02] that's exactly what he's saying to
[36:04] people yeah it's it's a different word
[36:06] for it but it's basically the same thing
[36:08] uh is there anything more you would like
[36:11] to share before we coming to our Andro
[36:13] team on the
[36:15] podcast I think uh yeah I'd like to
[36:18] share a few numbers maybe okay about
[36:20] Bitcoin and how it's been performing
[36:22] over the last couple years uh these are
[36:25] some just the few little images there
[36:29] okay just to show people can you see the
[36:31] screen there yeah yes I will I see it
[36:34] perfectly okay uh now I can't make it
[36:38] any bigger unfortunately but we can see
[36:40] here all these companies here that are
[36:42] already f for the ETF and what is about
[36:45] to happen once the the Dam breaks
[36:50] there's no stopping the the inflow of
[36:52] funds coming
[36:53] in and uh people are going to be very
[36:55] very surprised yeah they're going to
[36:57] wake up one day one night go to bed and
[37:00] Bitcoin might be one price and wake up
[37:03] the next day and it could be five or 10K
[37:06] higher that's what I see could be
[37:09] happening you know uh another thing here
[37:13] as well I'd like to show you something
[37:14] about the this a chart here done by
[37:18] Charlie uh Bello great guy on Twitter uh
[37:22] he put this out there uh in June this
[37:27] year and it just shows the difference
[37:29] between all other assets that people
[37:31] have been
[37:32] uh trying to save in or try to protect
[37:35] their wealth we can see here gold and
[37:38] how much it's been going up it's going
[37:40] up about 2% per
[37:42] year right now if the currency is being
[37:46] devalued by 7 to 10% a year like what's
[37:50] gold really doing for you it's not
[37:52] actually making you any more wealthier
[37:54] it's just trying to preserve your wealth
[37:58] I think that's what people don't
[37:59] understand about gold as well
[38:02] yeah right uh compared that to the US
[38:06] NASDAQ is up 177% you would have done
[38:08] well there yeah at least you would have
[38:10] been up above the the evaluation of the
[38:14] currency but look at Bitcoin it's up
[38:16] 150% year on year they're accumulating
[38:20] yeah in 2023 it's up
[38:24] 83% 2022 went down but that's okay you
[38:27] know uh the thing about Bitcoin it's not
[38:30] a get rich quick
[38:32] scheme yeah you need to do your work
[38:35] understand what you're buying understand
[38:36] the value of what you're buying and you
[38:39] need to hold it for a minimum of four
[38:41] years yeah and this this chart also uh
[38:46] shows extremely nice with Bitcoin that
[38:49] it has this um patterns it's up up up
[38:53] down up up up down up up up down with
[38:56] 2011 2013 up and then one down and we
[39:00] can just see the pattern going on and we
[39:02] are now in the Years where it's only
[39:05] going up if the cycle continues but I
[39:07] love the example that Michael sailor
[39:09] once uh gave that all the patterns uh
[39:15] break all the um uh models we have for
[39:20] the price are breaking once the big guy
[39:23] steps in like if there's a football game
[39:26] between amateurs if Cristiano Ronaldo
[39:29] all of the sudden comes in in the break
[39:30] for the other team this will win 10 Z
[39:34] and I think we have such a moment next
[39:36] year as you explained with the Bitcoin
[39:39] spot ETF and maybe we have a major super
[39:42] cycle that just keeps on growing and
[39:46] breaks this kind of Bitcoin cycle what
[39:48] do you think about
[39:50] that yeah this ETF is going to be a game
[39:53] changer it's going to be something
[39:54] completely different it's completely
[39:57] different yeah than what's been
[39:59] happening the last couple of years this
[40:01] another chart here the one I had before
[40:03] was open until June this is July the
[40:06] 14th to the 7 2023 and you can see here
[40:09] at this one you know it's still going up
[40:13] 150% here on average
[40:16] annually
[40:18] uh even if it was gone up 50% at least
[40:21] you're still beating monetary
[40:23] devaluation and that's what people need
[40:25] to get understand in their head if you
[40:27] have a business or if you're working
[40:29] somewhere right you at this moment you
[40:32] need to be increasing your prices by at
[40:34] least 10% per year or you have to be
[40:37] getting your an increase in your wages
[40:39] by 10% per year because the money
[40:42] because behind your back the currency is
[40:45] being devalued
[40:47] by a minimum of 7 to 10% per year in
[40:51] 2020 they devalued by 20% 2021 they done
[40:55] another 20% so basically in the space of
[40:59] 3
[41:00] years our currency have gone has gone
[41:03] down by at least 50% in three
[41:07] years yeah
[41:10] that's it's mind blowing if if uh you
[41:13] look at that with just the pure numbers
[41:16] of
[41:17] it
[41:19] yeah and people aren't looking at the
[41:22] numbers
[41:23] though yeah and like listen if not
[41:26] people's fault I didn't look at the
[41:28] numbers 48 years I was caught in that
[41:32] race of just trying to keep my head
[41:34] above water and not drown but we've been
[41:37] all right we've been okay I've always
[41:39] been okay you know I knew how to make
[41:41] money I just didn't understand what is
[41:44] money yeah a lot of people learned that
[41:47] uh really late as even Michael Z because
[41:50] we talked about him he understood money
[41:52] in 2020 he said it himself he was a
[41:55] public CEO for for over 20 years but
[41:58] never understood uh money and they you
[42:02] have to learn extra about it if you're
[42:05] just living in the field system and even
[42:08] if you're doing good or bad you don't
[42:10] know what money is yeah you won't and
[42:13] you won't be taught about it either
[42:15] because they don't want to teach you
[42:16] about it they have to go and learn
[42:18] yourself you won't go to college you
[42:23] know and they won't train you about what
[42:25] is money but if it doesn't suit them
[42:28] train
[42:29] what need to keep in that system that
[42:33] mindset keep you poor and that's what it
[42:36] does and I know a lot of people probably
[42:38] won't understand that maybe looking at
[42:40] this some people might some people don't
[42:43] but if your mindset is still in that fat
[42:47] system you're at nothing you can never
[42:50] catch up you need to get your mindset
[42:52] out of that
[42:54] system and then pull self out
[42:57] it do you think the masses will uh
[43:00] change the mindset once Bitcoin is like
[43:02] fully
[43:04] adopted I think they will I think it'll
[43:07] take a bit of time but you have to
[43:09] remember as well adoption is going to
[43:11] take it take take a bit of time now I
[43:14] seen something there last year about how
[43:17] Bitcoin was being adopted and at the
[43:19] moment it's been adopted three times
[43:21] faster than the internet was being
[43:23] adopted in the early days so that being
[43:26] said at that rate in about two and a
[43:28] half years time is going to be about 1
[43:31] billion people chasing after 21 million
[43:35] units in
[43:38] Total 1 billion people chasing after 21
[43:41] million units that is a, million chasing
[43:45] up to 21
[43:47] million that's but let's
[43:50] remember uh there's less than 1.8
[43:53] million on the exchanges the in utions
[43:56] are coming in so there'll probably be
[43:59] only like less than a million out there
[44:01] on these exchanges after the put for
[44:04] probably 18
[44:07] months so stack sets before the end of
[44:11] January St as much as you can people as
[44:14] you can and as hard as you
[44:17] can we have having an tine at the
[44:20] podcast where the previous guest asked a
[44:23] question for the next guest without
[44:25] knowing who the next guest is and the
[44:28] previous guest asked for you what
[44:30] elements of a Bitcoin standard have you
[44:33] adopted in your life and
[44:37] why okay very good well something about
[44:41] me I'm a little bit maybe different I'm
[44:43] running on about one month of Pat
[44:46] currency at the moment now I use P my
[44:50] bills and everything I'm not using it
[44:53] like in in in an ecosystem to buy things
[44:55] because I just feel the value of these
[44:57] satoshis is a lot more than what most
[45:01] people think yeah there's a difference
[45:04] between price and value and people are
[45:06] still looking at the price I I just
[45:09] understand the value of this uh I
[45:12] protected myself a lot as best I as I
[45:15] could I think yeah because even I lived
[45:18] through the 2008
[45:21] crash yeah I I I truly believe that
[45:23] that's coming as well sooner or rather
[45:26] later but we're in the Deb spiral at the
[45:28] moment you know the Deb is just out of
[45:30] control and that government levels now
[45:32] in
[45:33] 2008 it was at the banking level but
[45:37] it's been kicked up to the government
[45:39] level and they are not being held
[45:41] accountable for what they're spending
[45:43] yeah they just spending more and more
[45:44] and more and
[45:46] more uh I just don't want to get caught
[45:48] to be honest in having loads of fat in
[45:52] the bank you know like some of my
[45:54] friends do have a lot of fat and they
[45:56] still have it in the
[45:57] bank uh but that being said they won't
[46:00] take an hour out for me to do a zoom
[46:01] call with them and show them why they
[46:03] should put a portion of that into
[46:06] Bitcoin as an insurance for what's
[46:09] coming but for me I
[46:13] M now more or less I'm running I said
[46:17] one months a that's all I was before on
[46:20] about three to four months I thought
[46:22] that was enough and it was enough no
[46:24] problem but but but the thing about it
[46:27] is if that really does happen Bitcoin is
[46:29] the most liquid thing out there if I
[46:31] would have put that into property I
[46:33] couldn't Sol the bedroom out of my
[46:35] property but I can liquidate some a few
[46:38] Satoshi or a Bitcoin if I want to a
[46:41] whole Bitcoin if I want to anytime
[46:44] anytime any place anywhere and faster
[46:46] than I can faster than anything else
[46:48] that I've done before like property or
[46:50] like companies or stocks or gold or
[46:53] anything like that just it's just on
[46:54] money yeah Great Sound money yeah the
[46:58] hardest type of money you can bring it
[47:00] anywhere in the world it can't get
[47:02] seized from us as well like anything
[47:04] that most people have out there can be
[47:06] taken from them by
[47:08] force like their house their care
[47:11] outside of the road yeah uh their bank
[47:14] account can be taken from them by force
[47:17] you won't even know if your bank account
[47:18] been taken off you you just get a
[47:20] notification say your bank account is
[47:21] closed and uh sorry everything's been
[47:23] seized that's all will happen you know
[47:26] me your car you might see the tow truck
[47:27] come around come driving up the road
[47:30] with your car in the back of the tow
[47:31] truck what can you do then yeah people
[47:35] still don't get it you know but all
[47:38] these physical things that we have can
[47:40] be taken from the
[47:44] force it's a great ending point thank
[47:46] you for doing it Lawrence no problem
[47:49] we'll talk again soon yeah yeah
