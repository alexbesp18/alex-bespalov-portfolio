[00:00] we're excited to announce that we have a
[00:01] bill already we have a crafted a model
[00:03] Bill and we're putting it in front of
[00:03] lawmakers and regulators and asking them
[00:05] hey you should take a look at this we
[00:06] are also actively working on legislation
[00:08] to be able to ensure that states can
[00:10] participate in these types of strategic
[00:11] reserves as well we're very excited
[00:13] about strategic Reserves at the states
[00:14] and we think we can get it done in 2025
[00:16] there really just is no better asset in
[00:18] the world for stabilizing and
[00:19] establishing your purchasing value and
[00:21] power into the future than Bitcoin but
[00:23] Bitcoin as a as a savings technology
[00:24] really can't be outperformed because
[00:26] you're not relying on any one company or
[00:28] any one country's ability to be able to
[00:30] thrive and survive into the future we
[00:31] are going to see Bitcoin mining become
[00:33] one of the most important great
[00:34] infrastructure tools that we have
[00:35] available to us the cheapest energy
[00:36] comes from often times renewable energy
[00:38] you're going to see a consistent growth
[00:40] of Bitcoin mining using more and more
[00:41] clean energy I'm proud to say that the
[00:43] United States has the highest amount of
[00:44] hash rate of any country in the world we
[00:45] are on the upswing we are winning and we
[00:47] are scoring points just because Bitcoin
[00:49] is outside of the physical world and
[00:50] it's in the digital world doesn't mean
[00:52] that you're not at any time any
[00:53] government could use Force maybe
[00:55] violence even to come after you as a
[00:57] bitcoiner do you want to live in a
[00:58] country where you feel like you have to
[01:00] to hide and put your Bitcoin beneath
[01:01] your bed and hide your private keys and
[01:03] maybe you don't even have to hide can't
[01:05] even hide your private Keys cuz if they
[01:06] find them then they'll arrest you maybe
[01:07] you have to memorize it well what if
[01:08] something happens to you what if you get
[01:09] banged in the head you lose all your
[01:10] wealth cuz you're so fearful that your
[01:12] government is going to come and they're
[01:13] going to take your Bitcoin from you this
[01:15] is why bitcoiners need to become
[01:16] extremely politically active the United
[01:17] States and the people that live within
[01:19] the United States are the largest
[01:20] holders of Bitcoin in the entire
[01:22] [Music]
[01:24] world I want to talk as a first topic
[01:27] about the US strategic reserve of
[01:30] Bitcoin um I think it's really
[01:32] interesting before we get into like how
[01:34] it will happen and everything like that
[01:36] what do you think would be the
[01:37] implications if it actually happens iFit
[01:40] if Bitcoin is actually adopted as a
[01:42] strategic Reserve asset uh in the US
[01:46] well I think it would have profoundly
[01:48] important implications for the United
[01:50] States and would obviously be used as a
[01:53] great tool in our toolbox to be able to
[01:56] help us combat inflation and make sure
[01:58] to stabilize the economy
[02:00] um but but really though we we really
[02:02] should take a step back and and ask
[02:05] ourselves you know why why do we need a
[02:08] strategic reserve and why would the
[02:10] American people sort of benefit from
[02:12] this type of strategic reserve and it
[02:14] really has to do obviously with this
[02:16] idea that as time goes on the currency
[02:19] that we used to rely on as a currency to
[02:21] be able to save in is no longer viable
[02:24] as a form of savings it's not a great
[02:26] savings technology you know I think
[02:28] America and Americans even American
[02:30] leadership at this point recognizes that
[02:32] the dollar is not a great savings tool
[02:34] and this is why not only companies
[02:38] countries nation states governments and
[02:41] even individuals are finding trying to
[02:44] find any way possible to be able to get
[02:45] into assets and there really just is no
[02:48] better asset in the world for
[02:50] stabilizing and establishing your
[02:52] purchasing Val value and power into the
[02:54] future than Bitcoin and so what we
[02:56] really want to do is we want to make
[02:57] sure that the countries that adopt
[03:00] Bitcoin like El Salvador has uh that
[03:03] they are able to secure their purchasing
[03:05] power into the future and they can do
[03:07] that with Bitcoin and the number one
[03:08] reason why Bitcoin is so powerful as a
[03:10] tool for saving your value and your
[03:12] power into the future is because you
[03:14] can't debase the currency it's
[03:16] impossible anything El out there you can
[03:18] dilute and you can debase not just
[03:20] currencies you can also do this with
[03:21] stocks I me we see it happening right in
[03:22] front of us all the time there are
[03:24] publicly traded companies all across
[03:26] this ecosystem in the Bitcoin space
[03:27] outside the Bitcoin space and nothing
[03:29] against it some of them use it use it
[03:30] effectively as a tool uh but they but
[03:32] they're debasing they're debasing their
[03:34] their currencies these nation states
[03:35] these companies they're debasing and
[03:36] diluting their stock and if you believe
[03:38] in the way that they're allocating that
[03:41] diluted shares or that diluted currency
[03:44] back into the ecosystem to invest it
[03:46] then maybe it's a good idea but
[03:47] generally we don't see that type of
[03:48] behavior with governments governments
[03:50] tend to overspend um and they tend to uh
[03:55] overpay for a lot of projects so what we
[03:58] can do instead of is instead of having
[04:00] countries and states even in the USA
[04:03] rely on things like the dollar to be
[04:05] able to save in we can rely on things
[04:07] like Bitcoin um obviously I think you
[04:09] know there's a great story to be told
[04:10] around us treasuries as well a lot of
[04:12] people moving into us treasuries but but
[04:14] Bitcoin as a as a savings technology
[04:16] really can't be outperformed because
[04:18] you're not relying on any one company or
[04:20] any one country's ability to be able to
[04:22] thrive and survive into the future
[04:24] Bitcoin is a finite amount of Supply 21
[04:28] million that can't be changed and that's
[04:30] really important for countries and for
[04:32] States who are looking for a way to be
[04:34] able to save into the future that
[04:36] doesn't involve relying on other parties
[04:39] other third parties other countries
[04:41] other companies to be ensure that they
[04:43] can have that purchasing power far far
[04:45] into the future and so at Satoshi action
[04:48] not only are we endorsing the type of
[04:49] legislation that Senator lumus has put
[04:51] forward at the federal level we are also
[04:53] actively working on legislation to be
[04:55] able to ensure that states can
[04:56] participate in these types of strategic
[04:57] reserves as well and excited to announce
[05:00] that we have a bill already we have a
[05:01] crafted a model Bill and we're putting
[05:03] it in front of lawmakers and regulators
[05:05] and asking them you know hey you should
[05:06] take a look at this last cycle what we
[05:08] did we they said hey study it but at
[05:10] Satoshi action we're always progressing
[05:12] forward we always want to be on the
[05:13] bleeding edge of policy Innovation
[05:15] that's one of the exciting things about
[05:16] being at the state level in the US
[05:17] versus being at the federal level is you
[05:19] get 50 chances 50 different chances to
[05:21] be able to say hey let's innovate let's
[05:23] try this in Washington DC it's very hard
[05:25] to move policy along that's not true at
[05:27] the states we're very excited about
[05:29] strategic of the states and we think we
[05:30] can get it done in 2025 that's that's
[05:32] amazing I would love to see that um and
[05:35] now uh to to the original one what do
[05:38] you think is the implication of that
[05:40] when actually then uh the this is
[05:42] actually implemented and be coming along
[05:44] uh what kind of implications do you
[05:46] expect that from happening obviously a
[05:48] game the advantage of of the United
[05:51] States but is there is there more to
[05:53] it I mean yeah I mean it's great for
[05:55] Bitcoin right especially when you have
[05:57] nation states and and States themselves
[06:01] in the US allocating into Bitcoin you're
[06:03] obviously going to see an increase in
[06:05] the resources and the policy around
[06:07] Bitcoin increase and we might start to
[06:10] see policies that specifically Target
[06:13] Bitcoin in a positive way instead of
[06:15] seeing these broad ranging bills which
[06:17] you know sort of mix Bitcoin and crypto
[06:19] all in together which I understand why
[06:20] they want to do comprehensive
[06:21] legislation but at the end of the day
[06:23] you know Bitcoin is very much a unique
[06:25] technology it is out on its own
[06:27] completely there is no other crypto
[06:29] techn ology that is going to have the
[06:30] societal economic or energy impacts that
[06:32] Bitcoin will um specifically on the
[06:34] Bitcoin mining front I mean we are going
[06:36] to see Bitcoin mining become one of the
[06:38] most important grid infrastructure tools
[06:39] that we have available to us ever ever
[06:41] ever I mean like batteries are great
[06:43] like I like batteries a lot of
[06:44] bitcoiners don't like batteries they
[06:45] don't like renewable energy I'm a big
[06:47] fan of renewable energy I think that
[06:49] renewable energy is very affordable I
[06:50] think we're going to have a Dyson Sphere
[06:51] in the future and that involves a lot of
[06:53] solar panels a lot of windmills you
[06:54] we're capturing uh the energy that is
[06:56] already available to us and is always
[06:58] continuously available no matter what
[07:00] you know we're never going to run out of
[07:01] renewable energy and so in my opinion I
[07:04] think it's really important to make sure
[07:06] that our country can benefit from the
[07:08] opportunities that Bitcoin mining can
[07:10] provide and Bitcoin mining is this
[07:12] extremely powerful technology for
[07:14] monetizing excess energy for balancing
[07:16] the grid for enhancing Renewables I mean
[07:19] it it's it's almost like the perfect
[07:20] tool for renewable energy companies
[07:22] because whenever you build a renewable
[07:24] energy facility whether that be wind and
[07:26] solar and we're talking about variable
[07:27] renewable energy here of course not
[07:28] Hydro but whenever you build wind and
[07:30] solar plants you need to have someone
[07:32] who's going to buy that energy because
[07:34] it's going to be made or wasted either
[07:36] way it's not like a gas plant where you
[07:37] can turn it on and off and like save
[07:39] your fuel and that's sort of like a cost
[07:41] savings cost avoidance wind and solar
[07:44] create excess energy all the time that
[07:45] goes to waste and Bitcoin mining is this
[07:48] extremely valuable grid balancing
[07:50] technology and and renewable energy
[07:52] enhancing technology that can come in
[07:54] and buy up every single amount of wasted
[07:57] energy that wind and solar provide that
[07:59] is you know industry term in the wind
[08:01] and solar space is called curtailed
[08:02] energy so anytime you see excess energy
[08:05] from wind and solar get generated or
[08:07] doesn't get generated because it doesn't
[08:09] have a buyer and it gets wasted they
[08:11] call that curtailed energy and and it's
[08:13] wild like the the amount of curtailed
[08:14] energy that's going on across this
[08:15] planet is insane so like let's say
[08:17] California alone California they have a
[08:20] grid operator there called kaiso
[08:22] California's independent System Mod
[08:23] operator and they actually track the
[08:25] amount of curtailment that takes place
[08:26] from wind and solar in the state they
[08:28] are currently on track
[08:30] to curtail more energy by 2030 than the
[08:32] bottom 36 Nations combined and that's
[08:34] just one state it's one place on the
[08:37] planet and we have wind and solar
[08:40] generation being built all across the
[08:41] world has this same exact problem I was
[08:43] actually speaking to some renewable
[08:44] energy generators in another country
[08:46] recently and they curtail as much as 30%
[08:48] of their energy I mean it's an
[08:49] incredible amount of curtailment
[08:51] incredible amount of waste so things
[08:52] like a Bitcoin strategic Reserve I think
[08:54] are really valuable because I think at
[08:55] the end of the day once governments
[08:56] really start to hold Bitcoin they're
[08:58] going to care a lot more about other
[08:59] types of Bitcoin policies including how
[09:01] we can unlock Bitcoin mining in this
[09:02] country as a technology to enhance our
[09:04] Energy Systems i i l that a lot um do
[09:08] you think that America will be the first
[09:11] major country to actually like Embrace
[09:13] Bitcoin in in in a good way obviously as
[09:16] Salvador there Putin there are small
[09:18] countries but like America that would be
[09:20] a major country I also think about maybe
[09:22] Germany probably not uh but Germany
[09:24] would be a major country Argentina
[09:26] Brazil one of one of those so I mean
[09:28] it's let's let's let's be clear here
[09:31] that the United States and the people
[09:33] that live within the United States are
[09:34] the largest holders of Bitcoin in the
[09:36] entire world there are more Americans
[09:37] that hold Bitcoin in large amounts than
[09:39] any other place in the entire planet the
[09:42] United States itself is one of the
[09:43] largest holders of Bitcoin in the entire
[09:44] world already obviously that's through
[09:45] confiscation but they still hold quite a
[09:47] bit of Bitcoin hopefully we can convert
[09:48] that type of Bitcoin that they hold into
[09:50] a strategic Reserve but at the end of
[09:52] the day I mean the US is already far out
[09:54] and ahead on Bitcoin now we could always
[09:56] be doing much much better I mean we're
[09:58] we're fighting battles still left and
[10:01] right uh there's going to be a big fight
[10:02] in Texas where the lieutenant governor
[10:05] is coming out strongly against Bitcoin
[10:06] mining there's going to be a huge amount
[10:08] of work that's gonna have to go into
[10:10] combating that push back on Bitcoin
[10:13] mining but lawmakers are already
[10:15] starting to care and lawmakers on both
[10:16] sides of the aisle are starting to care
[10:18] and we see not only do we see
[10:20] Republicans who are way of course way
[10:21] out ahead on this issue right now but we
[10:23] see a lot of Democrats coming around as
[10:24] well and there's going to be a lot of
[10:25] exciting news in 2025 and even before
[10:28] then there's going to be some news that
[10:29] you'll you'll see that I know that's
[10:30] coming around the corner where it's be
[10:33] makes it more apparent that this is a
[10:34] bipartisan technology that unifies the
[10:36] cross party lines now although there be
[10:38] differences you know Democrats will want
[10:39] to enhance clean energy with Bitcoin
[10:42] mining and reduce the usage of Bitcoin
[10:44] mining around coal plants and uh
[10:46] Republicans are going to want to see all
[10:48] the above they're going to want to see
[10:49] Bitcoin mining use coal plants use gas
[10:51] plants use renewable energy and um those
[10:54] are the fights that I'm looking forward
[10:55] to because those are the real
[10:56] substantive fights not whether we should
[10:59] or shouldn't bit do Bitcoin that's where
[11:00] we are right now we need to get away
[11:01] from whether or not we should or
[11:02] shouldn't do Bitcoin and start migrating
[11:04] to an environment where we talk about
[11:06] how we're going to do Bitcoin and that
[11:09] migration you see happening within like
[11:12] a year or something like that so right
[11:13] now it's still like now yeah it's
[11:16] happening right now ah I love that
[11:18] really cool um within the United States
[11:20] there's all like uh States uh on the
[11:23] states level I thought about maybe it's
[11:25] interesting to think about the different
[11:27] states as they're really big also um
[11:29] what do you see as like the most
[11:31] friendly and the most um most friendly
[11:34] to bitcoin States obviously I think
[11:36] about Texas the first is is that like
[11:39] the the main one for you I think Texas
[11:41] has a lot of people that care deeply
[11:42] about Bitcoin there's definitely some
[11:44] lawmakers that care about Bitcoin there
[11:46] and Bitcoin mining but it's also going
[11:48] to face an incredible backlash here in
[11:49] the near term for political reasons in
[11:51] in my opinion and there's going to be a
[11:53] big push to limit the ability for
[11:55] Bitcoin mining to participate in Grid
[11:56] balancing programs that is not because
[11:58] Bitcoin mining is not good at balancing
[12:00] the Grid in fact it's because Bitcoin
[12:01] mining is so good at balancing the grid
[12:03] that the competitors in Texas don't want
[12:05] to see it continue to succeed and so
[12:07] they're using the long arm of the
[12:08] government there to limit the access for
[12:11] Bitcoin mining to that grid system uh
[12:13] but I I hearken back to the words of the
[12:15] late Brad Jones who you know co-authored
[12:17] a paper about Bitcoin mining's impact on
[12:19] the grid and in that paper we both
[12:21] clearly outlined the benefits of Bitcoin
[12:24] mining not only for the Texas grid but
[12:26] also for Energy Systems RIT large so in
[12:29] my opinion there will be this big fight
[12:30] in Texas I think it will ultimately not
[12:33] go as bad as it could um but there's
[12:35] going to be some body damage done for
[12:36] sure now across the country there are
[12:39] states looking to embrace Bitcoin at
[12:40] increasing rates we see States like
[12:42] Montana and States like Oklahoma as well
[12:44] as Louisiana doing a lot to be able to
[12:47] embrace this technology I would put
[12:48] Georgia in that list too a lot of great
[12:49] Bitcoin mining stuff going on in Georgia
[12:51] uh clean spark doing some great work out
[12:53] there and you know we see it expanding
[12:55] into other states as well it's it's
[12:57] really going to be a constant game
[12:59] of you know two steps forward one step
[13:01] back I mean that's really the way the
[13:02] policy game works we have to remember
[13:04] that we don't live in a vacuum there are
[13:06] competitors who want to use the energy
[13:08] that Bitcoin mining wants to use and
[13:10] Bitcoin mining is by far in a way the
[13:12] best benefit of Bitcoin um as far as
[13:14] like a from a feature perspective that
[13:17] Americans will be able to experience
[13:19] because ultimately we even though the
[13:21] dollar is not the best savings
[13:22] technology for the long term it is still
[13:25] way more stable in the short term
[13:26] compared to other currencies across the
[13:28] planet so in my opinion you're going to
[13:30] see a lot of these less stable
[13:32] currencies countries where there don't
[13:34] have stable Fiat currencies they're
[13:36] going to adopt Bitcoin faster or
[13:38] countries where they don't have their
[13:39] own currency and El Salvador is an exact
[13:41] example of that they're using the US
[13:43] dollar of course I think those are be
[13:46] the countries where you're going to see
[13:46] more of a monetary payment system story
[13:49] be told and then in countries that are
[13:51] huge energy rich Nations like the United
[13:54] States like Russia like China like India
[13:58] other countries as well you're going to
[13:59] see this Mass adoption you could put the
[14:01] Middle East in there there's some parts
[14:02] of the Middle East I would certainly put
[14:03] in there you're going to see Mass
[14:04] adoption of Bitcoin mining and so but as
[14:08] that adoption takes place you're going
[14:09] to say see these two steps forward one
[14:11] step back two steps forward on grid
[14:13] balancing enhancing Renewables and then
[14:15] what's going to happen is competitors in
[14:16] that space whether they be generators
[14:18] whether they be the battery companies
[14:20] are going to say hey well we don't
[14:21] really necessarily like all this Bitcoin
[14:22] mining coming in here and eating up our
[14:24] lunch eating our revenues up let's push
[14:27] back on them the only way that we can we
[14:28] can't beat them in the free market so
[14:30] we're going to use government to do that
[14:31] that's happening right now in Texas and
[14:33] it's definitely going to happen across
[14:34] the world as Bitcoin mining continues to
[14:36] prove to be one of the most important
[14:37] grid balancing Technologies and energy
[14:39] enhancing technologies that we have
[14:41] available to
[14:42] us that that's I never thought about
[14:44] better is being a competitive with
[14:46] Bitcoin mining but it's it's very
[14:47] logical actually uh that that's a
[14:49] fascinating never thought about it that
[14:51] way in my I mean listen in my opinion I
[14:53] think battery companies and Bitcoin
[14:54] mining can collaborate but but they're
[14:56] not there yet they don't see it that way
[14:59] they are going to see that anytime a a
[15:01] Bitcoin mine is balancing the grid
[15:03] through ancillary services like demand
[15:05] response frequency response or voltage
[15:07] regulation they are going to see that as
[15:09] a new competitor in the ecosystem and
[15:11] that's unfortunate because really
[15:12] Bitcoin mining companies and battery
[15:14] companies should be like owning each
[15:16] each other or doing joint ventures
[15:17] together or doing mergers and
[15:19] Acquisitions but we don't see that right
[15:22] now we just see competition and there's
[15:24] going to be I think a lot of push back
[15:26] right now the lot of the push back is
[15:27] coming from the generators in my opinion
[15:29] uh but there could be some push back
[15:31] from those battery companies as well
[15:32] going into the future because they serve
[15:34] a lot of the same needs they serve a lot
[15:36] of those grid balancing needs now
[15:37] batteries can do something that no other
[15:38] technology can which is they can store
[15:40] actual real energy and and deploy that
[15:43] energy at a different time in the day
[15:45] now Bitcoin miners can only shave off
[15:47] their load and then allow the energy to
[15:49] be used by a different load but they
[15:52] cannot hold the load and then release it
[15:54] at a later time so batteries will always
[15:56] have that as a competitive advantage in
[15:58] a space
[15:59] and Bitcoin will never be able to take
[16:01] that away from the battery
[16:02] ecosystem do you see in the United
[16:05] States the environment argument against
[16:07] Bitcoin still or is that kind of slowly
[16:10] dying off it's definitely dying off it's
[16:12] definitely on its way down now like I
[16:15] said two steps forward one step back we
[16:17] will see a lot of progress I think in
[16:19] the next year to two years but there's a
[16:21] possibility that we you know make steps
[16:22] backwards at times um there's been so
[16:26] much good work that has come out I'm
[16:27] proud to say that we at a soci action
[16:29] have released a body of peer-reviewed
[16:31] research papers uh in one in particular
[16:34] was in a top 2% Journal so high impact
[16:36] Journal ones that actually really make a
[16:38] big difference and we're just getting
[16:39] started with our research and so there
[16:41] are others in the space too though there
[16:42] are other companies other groups other
[16:44] nonprofits other universities that are
[16:47] working to advance research particularly
[16:49] peer reviewed research in the space I
[16:51] think that's critical for combating some
[16:53] of this fud some of this really what I
[16:55] would call misinformation around Bitcoin
[16:57] mining yes Bitcoin mining can be used to
[17:01] mine off of a coal plant that's true
[17:03] Bitcoin mining could be used to cause
[17:06] grid problems but that's not what people
[17:08] are trying to do today today people are
[17:09] trying to balance the grid they're
[17:11] trying to be a participant in the grid
[17:12] and they're trying to mine off some of
[17:13] the cleanest energy they possibly can
[17:15] and the reason why is because at times
[17:17] it's it's not even just because they
[17:18] have a mission to do good to the
[17:20] environment they also want the cheapest
[17:22] energy and the cheapest energy comes
[17:23] from often times renewable energy and so
[17:26] you're going to see a consistent growth
[17:27] of Bitcoin mining using more more clean
[17:29] energy um loving the growth of nuclear
[17:31] right now we're seeing explosion of
[17:32] nuclear because of the AI demands uh
[17:35] that I consider nuclear also to be a
[17:37] form of clean energy and I think that
[17:39] that argument is going to be made more
[17:40] and more and more not just by us but
[17:41] it's also going to be made by those at
[17:44] Google and Amazon right who have all
[17:46] these resources to dump into uh
[17:48] purchasing and acquiring and developing
[17:51] those those uh nuclear facilities But
[17:54] ultimately there will be consistent
[17:57] misinformation around Bitcoin to bitcoin
[17:59] it's never going to go away but we are
[18:00] on the upswing we are winning and we are
[18:02] scoring points and I think we're going
[18:03] to continue to do that as time goes on
[18:05] and we're going to start converting more
[18:06] of those people who were Skeptics to be
[18:09] Believers as as this we are right now
[18:12] recording I think like two three weeks
[18:13] out of the election uh and this will
[18:16] probably be uh published probably one
[18:18] week or one and a half weeks before the
[18:20] election um we kind of have to touch on
[18:23] this a little bit um even though it's
[18:25] almost too big of a topic for for for
[18:28] why sens as the bit the elections um
[18:33] what do you expect whether Trump or
[18:36] Harris uh will become the next president
[18:39] of United State do has has this any
[18:42] impact in a major way on what you are
[18:45] doing uh with the AC f with with
[18:48] everything that you're doing and
[18:49] involved in what you expect also in 2095
[18:52] how much of an impact has the question
[18:54] of who of those two people will be
[18:56] president
[18:59] so there's clearly going to be big
[19:00] impacts I think either way Bitcoin goes
[19:02] up uh in a trump Administration you're
[19:04] going to probably see the removal of
[19:07] Gary gendler that might also happen in a
[19:09] in a Harris Administration as well but
[19:10] more forcefully more likely in in a
[19:12] trump Administration and you're probably
[19:15] going to see a little less concern from
[19:17] the federal government around the energy
[19:19] consumption the energy usage of Bitcoin
[19:21] mining but regardless of who wins you
[19:24] know Trump or Harris pretty much
[19:26] everybody I mean because it's divided
[19:27] right you got a lot of people saying
[19:28] could go either way obviously poly
[19:30] Market it's way out pushing for for
[19:32] Trump in my opinion I think poly Market
[19:34] is a little bit skewed I'm not saying
[19:36] they're wrong I just think that poly
[19:38] Market is made up of probably
[19:40] predominantly men young men uh because
[19:43] young men are have a much higher
[19:44] propensity to gamble um and to be into
[19:47] the crypto space and so they're much
[19:49] more likely to believe that Trump is
[19:51] going to win I mean OB it's obvious we
[19:52] look at the demographics I mean even the
[19:53] Harris campaign has admitted that they
[19:55] have a problem with young men right now
[19:57] so I would say that poly Market is way
[19:58] skewed again they could be correct
[20:00] directionally but I think it's it's a
[20:02] little sort of out of pocket I think to
[20:04] predict that that what is it like it's a
[20:06] 6040 right now I think that Trump is
[20:08] likelihood of winning uh but at the
[20:10] polls it's a dead match it's a dead even
[20:13] uh all across the country so but the one
[20:16] thing that's not dead even the one thing
[20:17] that's pretty well agreed upon on both
[20:19] sides of the aisle is that there's going
[20:20] to be a gridlock in Congress you're
[20:22] going to likely see the Senate flip to
[20:23] Republicans and you're going to likely
[20:25] see the house flip to Democrats which
[20:27] means that when Congress is divided
[20:30] you're probably not going to see any
[20:31] activity take place and if and if it
[20:33] does take place it's going to be around
[20:34] things that there's a broad consensus
[20:37] maybe stable coins at best and that's I
[20:39] think being hopeful uh but definitely
[20:41] we're not going to see any comprehensive
[20:42] Bitcoin or crypto language pass through
[20:45] the house and the Senate and get signed
[20:46] by the president it's very unlikely uh
[20:48] and that means that state work the work
[20:50] that we're doing at Satoshi action is so
[20:53] much more important than ever before
[20:55] because we can continue to drive forward
[20:57] Bitcoin policy Innovative Bitcoin
[20:59] policies that Advance renewable energy
[21:01] that Advance Bitcoin mining that Advance
[21:04] uh balancing the grid that help to bank
[21:07] the unbanked that help states to be able
[21:09] to acquire Bitcoin these are all things
[21:12] that we are working on at Satoshi action
[21:13] these are all things that we can get
[21:14] across the Finish Line in 2025 and
[21:16] Beyond these are not things that are
[21:17] probably going to happen in in DC now
[21:20] you know I I thoughts and prayers to my
[21:23] my friends in Washington DC who are
[21:25] going to have to suffer through the next
[21:26] two maybe four years of gridlock
[21:29] but uh you know keep up the fight
[21:30] because once we get a lot of these wins
[21:32] at the state level the states are going
[21:34] to lead and I've said this before the
[21:35] states will lead they have led they'll
[21:37] continue to lead and then ultimately
[21:39] Washington DC will follow the actions of
[21:41] those States and this is not something
[21:42] new to bitcoin this is something that's
[21:44] been around for a long time this is a
[21:46] strategy that's been around for decades
[21:48] really you can see it through the
[21:50] Cannabis industry how effectively they
[21:51] use the strategy go state by state by
[21:53] state get so many states on your side
[21:55] you basically Force the hand of
[21:56] Washington DC and that's what's
[21:57] happening right now in the cannabis
[21:58] industry that's what H what's that is
[22:00] what's going to happen in the Bitcoin
[22:01] industry we're already well on our way
[22:02] with four states having passed Pro
[22:04] Bitcoin legislation including
[22:05] protections for self- custody
[22:06] protections for node running protections
[22:08] for Bitcoin mining for protections for
[22:09] peer-to-peer transactions these are all
[22:11] things that are happening at the state
[22:12] level and I believe ultimately once we
[22:14] pass through this gridlock we will see
[22:15] these things passing into law in
[22:16] Washington
[22:17] DC what can the average bitcoiner who's
[22:21] watching that to to influence on a state
[22:25] level on the United States uh a a little
[22:29] bit higher level uh to influence law and
[22:32] and governments into making bit making
[22:35] the UN United States a little bit
[22:37] Bitcoin friendlier I mean the best thing
[22:38] you can do to make the us more Bitcoin
[22:40] friendly is just continue to educate you
[22:42] know and if you don't if you're not in a
[22:43] position to educate your lawmaker or
[22:45] your regulator or those folks that are
[22:46] working in the government that have the
[22:47] position to make decisions on these
[22:49] Technologies you know talk to groups
[22:51] that can you know I mean I I'm we're a
[22:53] big resource we talk to State lawmakers
[22:55] and regulators and federal folks as well
[22:58] uh all the the time regularly so we're
[23:00] very attuned to uh the education process
[23:02] we've spoke to Republicans and Democrats
[23:04] both sides of the aisle everybody in
[23:06] between as well and we've been able to
[23:08] pitch a compelling story around Bitcoin
[23:10] um because the things that we say about
[23:11] Bitcoin are true Bitcoin can be used as
[23:14] a powerful technology to balance the
[23:16] grid these are things that lawmakers
[23:17] know that they want they know they need
[23:18] to to have a technology that can balance
[23:20] the grid they know they need a
[23:22] technology that can help to provide
[23:24] emergency backup Reserve power when when
[23:26] there's a winter storm I mean just look
[23:27] at Texas Texas they had two winter
[23:30] storms back to back that took the grid
[23:32] to its knees the first one was winter
[23:33] storm Yuri Bitcoin mining didn't exist
[23:35] really in prevalence in the State uh the
[23:37] grid was brought to its knees they had
[23:39] 700 people die it was a total
[23:42] catastrophe turn around the very next
[23:44] year the very next winter and you have
[23:46] winter storm Elliott same kind of storm
[23:48] but the difference this time was the
[23:49] Texas grid was much more prepared they
[23:51] had multiple new Tools in their toolbox
[23:53] including Bitcoin mining the reason why
[23:56] they had more Bitcoin mining is cuz
[23:57] China banned Bitcoin mining they didn't
[23:59] understand the technology they didn't
[24:00] understand the value of it they banned
[24:01] it all the miners came to America they a
[24:03] lot of them plugged into Texas started
[24:04] to plug into the grid balancing programs
[24:06] that Ott had in place for many years and
[24:09] uh when that winter storm hit when
[24:11] winterstorm Elliott hit they shut off
[24:13] their power in the middle of an
[24:14] emergency when everyone else is trying
[24:15] to turn up their heat trying to keep
[24:16] their homes warm trying to keep the
[24:17] hospitals running the Bitcoin miner shut
[24:19] down and returned roughly 1.7 gwatt of
[24:22] power back to that great now 1.7 gws to
[24:24] put that in context it's an incredible
[24:27] amount of power it's non it's
[24:29] non-trivial uh it is enough power to
[24:32] heat 1.7 million small homes it's enough
[24:34] power to energize 320 large hospitals so
[24:36] right in the middle of this emergency
[24:37] Bitcoin mining is there providing that
[24:39] service and that is a service that state
[24:41] lawmakers Regulators Federal elected
[24:43] officials across the world in America
[24:46] they all know that they need these types
[24:47] of Technologies and Bitcoin mining is
[24:49] proving that it can be one of the best
[24:51] at balancing the grid and making sure
[24:52] that we have emergency Reserve backup
[24:54] system so if you want again these are
[24:56] the compelling stories we talked to
[24:57] lawmakers about about if you want to see
[24:59] your lawmaker your regulator in your
[25:02] country your state be Pro Bitcoin you
[25:04] need to tell them compelling stories
[25:05] about what Bitcoin can do that is
[25:07] important to them not important to you I
[25:10] mean that's fine if you want to tell
[25:11] them why you were TR and I will say it
[25:13] is helpful to tell lawmakers why you
[25:15] were drawn to the technology what is it
[25:17] about Bitcoin that you love but
[25:18] sometimes you don't have enough time to
[25:20] talk about what you love and you only
[25:22] have enough time to talk about what they
[25:23] might love about Bitcoin and lawmakers
[25:25] across this country care about the Grid
[25:27] it's a big issue right now they're
[25:29] looking for new ways they're looking for
[25:30] innovative solutions they also care
[25:32] about stabilizing the economy and
[25:34] providing other tools in the toolbox to
[25:35] be able to combat inflation and reserve
[25:37] the purchasing power of states in the US
[25:39] and the country um they also want to see
[25:42] rural jobs be created and Bitcoin mining
[25:44] creates plenty of rural jobs now it's
[25:45] not a mega job Creator but at the end of
[25:47] the day a 100 jobs in a city of 10,000
[25:50] or a town of 1,000 that's a huge amount
[25:52] of jobs for that what probably was a
[25:54] dying City or dying town so these are
[25:57] things again these are compelling
[25:58] stories that Bitcoin can do will do and
[26:02] lawmakers will react to them in a
[26:03] positive way if you can present them in
[26:05] that way you know stay away from
[26:06] ideology stay away from Bitcoin versus
[26:08] crypto it really doesn't matter when
[26:10] you're talking about what Bitcoin can do
[26:12] because only Bitcoin really at scale can
[26:14] do any of these things sure there's
[26:16] there's there's others out there that
[26:17] have copied the code they look similar
[26:19] in design but they don't have the
[26:20] liquidity they're not worth 1.3 trillion
[26:23] they're not going to be trusted they
[26:24] don't have the they don't have the track
[26:25] record they don't have the level of
[26:27] decentralization that Bitcoin has so you
[26:29] don't really need to worry about Bitcoin
[26:31] versus crypto when you're talking about
[26:32] what Bitcoin can do and you know of
[26:35] course it's fine if you have a lawmaker
[26:37] who asks we do we sometimes do we have
[26:39] more of this happening which is exciting
[26:40] more lawmakers are saying well I think
[26:42] Bitcoin is a little different than
[26:43] crypto that I heard that recently from a
[26:45] Democrat I was very excited and so um
[26:48] they're starting to pay attention and
[26:50] things are starting to change and that's
[26:52] because groups like Satoshi action but
[26:54] of course other groups as well are out
[26:56] there educating lawmakers and regulators
[26:58] um to date we've we've over educated I
[27:00] think educated and engaged at least at
[27:03] least 2,000 lawmakers so it's incredible
[27:05] amount of lawmakers that includes all
[27:06] 535 members of Congress who we hand
[27:08] delivered Bitcoin books to we hand
[27:10] delivered multiple Bitcoin books to
[27:11] every single member of Congress yes our
[27:14] CS were very sore at the end of the day
[27:15] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[27:18] a regular basis I'll guess you already
[27:20] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[27:23] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[27:26] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[27:28] personal recommendation for hard wallet
[27:30] is the bitbox it's super secure it's

[28:32] completely new for you guys I partnered
[28:36] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[28:39] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[28:42] saw created by anyone look at that
[28:45] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[28:48] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[28:51] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[28:54] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[28:56] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[29:00] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[29:03] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:06] watch collections you have the date of
[29:09] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:12] there and of course also the block
[29:14] height and which EPO we are currently in
[29:18] I love the level of detail they put in
[29:20] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[29:23] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:26] time pieces down in the Des descriptions
[29:28] I love those watches so so
[29:32] much yeah I can imagine yeah um how big
[29:36] of an impact is it when a potential
[29:39] presidential candidate As Trump comes
[29:41] out and goes to bitcoin conferences and
[29:44] says like oh we have to mine all the
[29:45] Bitcoin In America which is absurd but I
[29:48] think it sends an interesting signal um
[29:52] what what what impact does that do for
[29:55] the law is is that making things easier
[29:58] here immediately or is it more like oh
[30:00] yeah he talks about it maybe it will be
[30:02] the long term better than if he gets
[30:04] elected so yeah I mean listen we're
[30:06] never going to mine all the Bitcoin in
[30:07] the United States I love it I love it in
[30:09] sentiment right you know I love the the
[30:11] sort of like the ethos of it uh but at
[30:14] the end of the day that would be a bad
[30:15] idea uh you don't want to mine all the
[30:17] Bitcoin in one place could cause
[30:19] centralization issues now I think the
[30:20] Bitcoin network will do just fine and
[30:23] we'll find a way to navigate around
[30:25] those sorts of obstacles we've navigated
[30:26] around many other many worse obstacles
[30:28] than that um but certainly you don't
[30:30] want to see all the Bitcoin mining
[30:31] taking place here in the USA I'm I'm
[30:33] proud to say that the United States is
[30:35] is the highest has the highest amount
[30:37] hash rate of any country in the world
[30:38] that is I think fine but you really
[30:41] don't want to see 100% you know mind in
[30:43] the United States but uh I think that
[30:45] these types of things bode well for the
[30:47] technology you know it's it regardless
[30:51] of what side of the aisle you're on you
[30:52] do want to see you do want to see the
[30:54] leaders in these parties you want to see
[30:55] them advocating for Bitcoin that's a
[30:56] really good sign it's shows that not
[30:58] only do we have value to add from a
[31:00] technology perspective from an economic
[31:02] perspective but clearly it's a powerful
[31:04] winning voting issue which is what you
[31:06] want you want your issue to be a winning
[31:09] issue you don't want to be a losing
[31:10] issue we were a losing issue for a while
[31:12] I think in my opinion um I don't think
[31:14] enough people embraced Bitcoin at the
[31:16] rates that we have today you know if you
[31:18] go back eight years ago there wasn't
[31:19] enough supporters there wasn't enough
[31:21] money there wasn't enough people
[31:22] lobbying or spending money in the
[31:23] political space or voting and so there
[31:25] really wasn't it wasn't a winning issue
[31:27] for them to to be able to embrace
[31:28] Bitcoin back you know eight years ago or
[31:30] even all the way back to bitcoin's uh
[31:32] foundation in 2009 but now there is
[31:35] there's there's Millions Americans who
[31:36] are holding Bitcoin some people say as
[31:38] many as 50 million people hold some type
[31:39] of crypto which I think is important um
[31:42] you know we have course sort of Bitcoin
[31:43] versus crypto I think doesn't matter
[31:45] exactly as quite as much when you're
[31:46] counting votes because all 50 million of
[31:49] those people a vast majority of them at
[31:50] least I believe care positively about
[31:52] Bitcoin I don't I very rarely meet
[31:53] crypto people that don't like Bitcoin
[31:56] they might like something else more but
[31:58] they generally like Bitcoin so you have
[32:00] like 50 million people roughly maybe
[32:02] maybe a little less than that that care
[32:04] about this technology they're going to
[32:05] vote about the technology they're going
[32:08] to show up to the polls they're going to
[32:10] show up to rallies they're going to
[32:11] they're going to donate I mean we've
[32:13] seen the more donations come from the
[32:15] crypto industry and the Bitcoin industry
[32:17] than anytime in our history talking
[32:20] exclusively about Bitcoin and then going
[32:21] be going outside of Bitcoin it is
[32:24] actually an astonishing number because
[32:25] you have roughly
[32:29] uh 50% of all super pack money which
[32:31] listen I'm not some big super pack you
[32:34] know Stan I'm not a I'm not a big
[32:36] supporter of this type of big money in
[32:38] politics but regardless I think it's an
[32:40] important metric uh you've got 50% of
[32:42] all Super PAC money coming from crypto
[32:45] that's what wild I mean like and here's
[32:48] the more here's the more insane number
[32:49] if you go back 10 years we're number two
[32:53] from just one cycle from just this cycle
[32:55] from just this election cycle more or
[32:56] less if you go back to 10 years because
[32:58] we weren't really spending any money now
[32:59] we're spending a ton of money in this
[33:01] election cycle we are out competing the
[33:03] oil and gas industry we're out competing
[33:05] the renewable industry the only people
[33:07] we're not beating is the coch brothers
[33:08] and that's not going to last long I mean
[33:10] you get one more cycle and it's over
[33:12] we'll be the number one political
[33:14] Spenders in in in a decade probably even
[33:17] going back further than that and that's
[33:18] because not only are the people in this
[33:20] space extremely entrenched from a moral
[33:24] and ethical perspective but they're also
[33:26] highly entrenched from a monetary
[33:29] perspective their entire net worth might
[33:31] be in Bitcoin I know can tell you a
[33:33] large percentage of my net worth is in
[33:34] Bitcoin um and there's people in the
[33:37] crypto space who are 100% into Bitcoin
[33:39] and or another technology so if someone
[33:42] shows up and says hey I'm gonna Advance
[33:45] your your cause you're going to be
[33:47] really excited about that because you're
[33:48] probably not only holding the Bitcoin
[33:49] because you think it's going to go up
[33:50] you're probably holding Bitcoin also
[33:52] because you think it's a fix to a lot of
[33:53] the world's problems so you're highly
[33:55] motivated to donate to that candidate
[33:56] and you're highly motivated to vote for
[33:58] that candidate as well so um I'll stop
[34:01] there that was a lot but at the end of
[34:02] the day you know I'm very bullish on the
[34:04] direction of where Bitcoin is going to
[34:05] go in the United States and it's all
[34:07] stems from people were willing to stand
[34:08] up and educate lawmakers regulators and
[34:11] talk to their family members that are an
[34:12] elected Physicians to be able to get
[34:14] them to understand why we should be Pro
[34:17] Bitcoin I want to take one small step
[34:20] backwards I think um uh a lot of bit
[34:23] corers that I meet uh and I myself I was
[34:27] in politics actually before Bitcoin and
[34:28] then I came into Bitcoin I went a little
[34:30] bit outside of Austrian politics and now
[34:32] I'm getting uh more excited about it
[34:35] again uh I think a lot of bitcoiners are
[34:38] maybe not this year but usually uh
[34:40] trying to like stay out of politic
[34:42] politics they're like a politics can do
[34:44] whatever they want and I have my Bitcoin
[34:47] um I fought like that also last year I
[34:50] I'm changing my STS a lot on on this
[34:52] matter um why is it so important for us
[34:55] bitcoiners to even get uh entrenched in
[34:59] in those talks get uh talking with
[35:02] politics push for good Bitcoin loss why
[35:05] why is that uh good when we as Bitcoin
[35:08] say oh Bitcoin game fair will play out
[35:10] Bitcoin interet will is is there why why
[35:12] should we get talking with politics it's
[35:15] a great question it's one that I get all
[35:17] the time I think it's important to go
[35:20] back to uh the beginning of my Bitcoin
[35:23] Journey with regards to politics I was
[35:26] in the same boat as everyone else
[35:27] Bitcoins outside of government get
[35:29] Bitcoins outside of politics and this is
[35:30] coming from someone who spent a lot of
[35:31] time you know involved in the the
[35:33] political space and also monitoring
[35:34] quite heavily growing up in a very uh
[35:36] politically engaged family you know but
[35:38] I thought for some time bitcoin's
[35:40] outside this but then one of the things
[35:42] that dawned on me as I was you know
[35:46] experiencing the shutdowns like
[35:48] everybody else was like you know you
[35:50] could have your Bitcoin and that's great
[35:53] but just because Bitcoin is outside of
[35:55] the physical world and it's in the
[35:57] digital world world doesn't mean that
[35:58] you're not and at any time any
[36:01] government could use Force maybe
[36:04] violence even to come after you as a
[36:06] bitcoiner and so you have to ask
[36:08] yourself do you want to live in a world
[36:10] do you want to live in a country where
[36:12] you feel like you have to hide and put
[36:14] your Bitcoin beneath your your bed and
[36:16] hide your private keys and maybe you
[36:18] don't even have to hide can't even hide
[36:19] your private keys because if they find
[36:20] them then they'll arrest you you maybe
[36:21] you have to memorize it well what if
[36:23] something happens to you what if you get
[36:24] banged in the head you lose all your
[36:25] wealth because you're so fearful that
[36:28] your government is going to come and
[36:29] they're going to take your Bitcoin from
[36:30] you that is not a world that I want to
[36:31] live in I don't think that's a world
[36:32] that anybody wants to live in and so if
[36:34] you don't want to live in that world if
[36:36] you want to live in a world where
[36:37] governments Embrace Bitcoin they embrace
[36:39] the technology like El Salvador and they
[36:41] Advance the technology and protect
[36:43] bitcoiners and they protect the usage of
[36:45] Bitcoin then you should want to see
[36:47] bitcoiners like myself and others get
[36:49] highly politically engaged and start
[36:50] pushing for Bitcoin rights protections
[36:53] of the right to self- custody the right
[36:55] to mine the right to use a node the
[36:57] right to pe- toer transactions of course
[36:59] these are things that should naturally
[37:00] be protected but unfortunately we need
[37:03] to be able to regulate and create rules
[37:05] around what the government can do
[37:07] because if we don't they will they will
[37:09] come take your Bitcoin they will tax
[37:11] your Bitcoin they will tax your Bitcoin
[37:13] mining Revenue to death they will
[37:15] because at the end of the day you know
[37:18] they're going to see that as a soft
[37:19] target so we need to create protections
[37:22] for this technology as quickly as we can
[37:25] and as sustainably as we can to ensure
[37:27] that we can live and know that we live
[37:30] in a country that Embraces the
[37:31] technology and we don't have to worry
[37:32] about choosing between hiding underneath
[37:34] of the Shadows or fleeing to another
[37:36] country sure you want to flee do you
[37:38] want to uproot your entire family and
[37:39] flee I mean you're you're 26 I'm 36 I
[37:42] have a family I have a house my
[37:44] mother-in-law lives with me like we my
[37:47] kid just got starting to get good grades
[37:48] in school their things are going well
[37:51] why would I want to flee this country
[37:53] just so I can hold my Bitcoin maybe some
[37:55] people would choose not to hold their
[37:56] Bitcoin because they don't want have to
[37:57] flee the country also don't want that
[38:00] outcome so this is why bitcoiners need
[38:02] to become extremely politically active
[38:04] I'll go back to uh a couple of quotes I
[38:07] have really these really great quotes
[38:08] out there around why you should be
[38:10] politically engaged and I'll paraphrase
[38:11] them of course one is you might not like
[38:14] politics you might not even be
[38:16] interested in politics but politics is
[38:17] interested in you government is
[38:19] interested in you and so it's up to you
[38:21] as an individual to stand up and and get
[38:24] involved and get engaged because and
[38:25] here's the second quote if you
[38:28] decide
[38:29] to relinquish your responsibility to be
[38:32] politically engaged and to be involved
[38:33] with the government you will be ruled by
[38:35] people who don't like you and people who
[38:38] are probably inferior to you so do you
[38:42] want to see a world where those types of
[38:43] people over over have power over you I
[38:45] don't I want to see bitcoiners who are
[38:47] thoughtful who are caring who think
[38:50] about who think far into the future who
[38:52] care about incentives and who care about
[38:54] Society to be the ones making the rules
[38:56] I don't want the rules to be set by
[38:57] people who don't like Bitcoin I want the
[38:59] rules to be set by people who
[39:01] do I I love that a lot uh that's what
[39:04] also changed my stance this year
[39:06] especially Al with the Bitcoin podcast
[39:08] that I have on the influence of the
[39:09] guest because uh you like bit government
[39:13] cannot destroy Bitcoin but government
[39:15] can make your life really miserable with
[39:17] Bitcoin and I think that's a really good
[39:20] takeaway for here and one more thing
[39:22] there too you're right absolutely uh if
[39:25] people don't like the idea of being
[39:27] politically active they don't like the
[39:29] idea of bills being passed well they
[39:31] must really hate the US Constitution
[39:33] which protects all of our rights in the
[39:34] in America I mean I I just think it's
[39:36] crazy you have these people that run
[39:37] around and they say screw the government
[39:39] get rid of the government and they raise
[39:41] their hand and say I love the US
[39:42] Constitution it's a great document it
[39:44] you cannot have it both ways you cannot
[39:46] have a world without
[39:48] rules and also sort of simultaneously
[39:50] like the US Constitution because it is a
[39:52] set of rules really that is a framework
[39:55] for preventing government overreach and
[39:57] giving us our rights our right freedom
[39:58] of speech super important especially
[40:00] when it pertains to bitcoin that that is
[40:03] a rule and really R regulations are are
[40:05] just rules and so people that say
[40:07] they're anti-regulation I'm like well do
[40:09] you like do you like rules that protect
[40:11] you from government overreach probably
[40:13] so they are good rules there are bad
[40:14] rules they good regulations they bad
[40:15] regulations I like regulations which
[40:17] Give Me Freedom um I think other
[40:20] bitcoiners will as well I mean if it
[40:22] comes down to that level I think like
[40:25] the Bitcoin white paper is a rule
[40:28] the Bitcoin system is R you'll love my
[40:30] you'll love my talk in Switzerland
[40:33] then you will be in Lugo come see me in
[40:36] Lugano I'm gonna talk all about that
[40:38] really really cool um let's talk about a
[40:41] little bit about your journey in making
[40:43] that happen making uh Bitcoin loss
[40:46] basically what are some big of the what
[40:48] are some of the biggest challenges that
[40:50] you faced so far in the last what two
[40:53] two three years that you're doing that
[40:55] now two and a half years yep we're going
[40:57] on our third year we're almost there
[40:59] it'll be our third cycle so States
[41:01] operate a little differently than the
[41:02] federal government Most states about 95%
[41:04] of them they have short sessions which
[41:06] means they last from about January to
[41:08] maybe March April May they're different
[41:10] lengths so it's sort of like a it's like
[41:14] a it's a mad dash right so one of the
[41:16] biggest problems that we face when we
[41:17] hit January is we're we have so much
[41:20] going on that we sort of can't handle it
[41:21] all I mean there's so many opportunities
[41:23] for us to be able to pass Pro Bitcoin
[41:24] bills into law and it really comes down
[41:26] to our ability just be active and be in
[41:28] those States and the time the places
[41:29] where we can be active the places where
[41:31] we can show up and actually talk
[41:33] directly to lawmakers not just rely on
[41:35] lobbyists lobbyists are great but nobody
[41:37] can tell the compelling message of
[41:38] Bitcoin better than our own team can
[41:40] better than I can better than our policy
[41:41] director can or better than our director
[41:43] of development can so um and then I
[41:45] would also include in there our uh our
[41:47] head of science uh Dr rut as well so it
[41:50] it it really benefits us when we have
[41:51] the resources to be able to fly
[41:53] ourselves into the states to be able to
[41:55] spend time there um obviously that's
[41:57] time spent away from family that's time
[41:58] spent on the road but it is very much
[42:01] worth it because we're able to secure
[42:02] these huge wins for Bitcoin but every
[42:04] time you go if you go look at any state
[42:07] we've passed a law in we spent a lot of
[42:09] time in that state and or we worked
[42:10] directly with really great groups
[42:12] there's really great groups on the
[42:13] ground in a lot of these states you got
[42:14] the frontier Institute in Montana you've
[42:17] got the bit Oklahoma Bitcoin Association
[42:19] in Oklahoma and you've also got the
[42:21] Idaho Freedom foundation in Idaho um
[42:24] you've got the beacon Center in
[42:25] Tennessee you've got a lot of these
[42:26] really great what I call center right
[42:29] think tanks in those States there's of
[42:30] course Center left think tanks in other
[42:31] states as well but they have embraced
[42:34] Bitcoin in a great way and that's
[42:36] resulted in very positive outcomes
[42:39] because it like I said if you support
[42:42] Bitcoin and you care about Bitcoin a lot
[42:44] and you go like myself or you go like my
[42:46] team and you advocate for Bitcoin the
[42:48] message that you're going to sell to
[42:49] those lawmakers is going to be much more
[42:52] compelling the message that a lobbyist
[42:54] tells listen we've had great lobbyists
[42:56] before that have helped us they but
[42:57] they're higher guns right they're
[42:59] they're just there to help you know get
[43:00] your bill passed um but they don't have
[43:02] a as big of an incentive in fact
[43:04] sometimes lobbyists have an incentive to
[43:05] not get things done because then you can
[43:07] keep paying them you know for cycle
[43:08] after cycle I I don't think we work with
[43:10] lobbyists like that we have great
[43:10] lobbyists that work hard to get things
[43:12] done but there is a small incentive to
[43:14] say why why pass it this year why not
[43:15] work together again next year and we can
[43:17] keep keep things going for us to be
[43:19] honest we will always keep coming back
[43:21] because we have new ideas new Cutting
[43:22] Edge Innovative policy Solutions but my
[43:25] point is that when you have these groups
[43:27] groups which have adopted Bitcoin and
[43:29] embraced Bitcoin they are like
[43:31] superpowered lobbyists they're they're
[43:33] basically an extension of the Bitcoin
[43:34] ecosystem and they can tell the
[43:36] compelling story as well so a big thing
[43:38] for us as Satoshi action and if you're a
[43:40] group listening you know please reach
[43:41] out if you're politically active group
[43:43] especially at a state level and you care
[43:45] a lot about Bitcoin and you're going to
[43:46] make it a part of your mission to get it
[43:47] across the Finish Line you should reach
[43:49] out to us because we can help you get
[43:52] these things done uh we can help you
[43:54] pass Bitcoin rights into law in your
[43:56] state um a lot of groups are reaching
[43:58] out we've had a lot of great
[43:59] collaboration between some of these
[44:00] groups and we're looking to expand but
[44:02] at the end of the day the biggest
[44:04] constraint for us going back to your
[44:06] first point um is that we just need more
[44:09] resources we need more resources because
[44:10] we have too much work and we can't get
[44:12] it all done ourselves I love that a lot
[44:15] uh really cool I think we we should get
[44:17] involved in politics we should get
[44:19] involved with with uh it it it comes
[44:22] down to like uh you should get involved
[44:25] in developing your neighborhood and the
[44:27] neighborhood gets the district and state
[44:29] level counter level all that things so I
[44:31] think that's that's something that uh
[44:33] Bitcoin is actually also really big on
[44:35] and and I love that aspect of it really
[44:37] cool um one last question before we come
[44:40] to the end routine of our podcast is
[44:42] when this strategic Reserve asset
[44:45] Bitcoin is actually adopted with uh with
[44:48] with the states um could that kind of
[44:52] strengthen and maybe even uh um survive
[44:56] or like like rescued the US dollar is
[44:59] that something that you're looking at
[45:01] when when uh Bitcoin will be then backed
[45:04] or US dollar will be back by by Bitcoin
[45:06] that's a great I I love this this this
[45:08] mental exercise of looking into the
[45:11] future on where Bitcoin and the US
[45:14] dollar Collide in my opinion I believe
[45:17] that Bitcoin and the US dollar will
[45:20] exist into the future together
[45:22] simultaneously for some time I think
[45:25] that a lot of government and a lot of
[45:28] currencies around the world will convert
[45:30] to either Bitcoin or the dollar and
[45:32] maybe maybe both um the reason being is
[45:35] because the dollar is very stable in the
[45:37] short term it allows individuals that
[45:39] are experiencing massive inflation to
[45:42] actually have a a currency they can rely
[45:43] on and depend on I and I actually
[45:45] believe also that stable coins will be
[45:48] the pathway for the broad world to be
[45:51] able to get access to the US dollar um
[45:53] that's already happening uh companies
[45:55] like tether companies like Circle
[45:57] are clearly the dominant two in that
[45:59] ecosystem and they're going to continue
[46:00] to be for some time I mean tethers
[46:03] already holds like more us treasuries
[46:05] than many many many nations combined
[46:08] so that is going to be how the dollar
[46:10] expands and I think that's how the
[46:12] dollar maintains a lot of its stability
[46:14] you know you need growth in users is
[46:16] really valuable and the US dollar
[46:18] already has a lot of access to the
[46:20] global markets I think that stable coins
[46:22] will just help the US dollar penetrate a
[46:23] little bit deeper into the hands of the
[46:25] individual now at the the same time I
[46:27] think Bitcoin will also I think people
[46:29] call this a a bar Barrel Theory or
[46:31] something like that where it's like both
[46:32] ends are you know sort of heavy in the
[46:34] middle everything gets destroyed um or
[46:36] it's flat and um I think that Bitcoin
[46:39] will be the prominent long-term savings
[46:41] technology that people will use I also
[46:43] think that uh my theory around the
[46:46] impact of Bitcoin directly on the dollar
[46:48] like here and at home is that Bitcoin
[46:51] will become especially once stable it's
[46:53] not stable yet but in the next 10 15
[46:55] years we're going to see a lot more
[46:55] stability out of Bitcoin
[46:57] and when it's a lot more stable it will
[46:59] be a very very accurate measuring device
[47:02] for how much monetary debasement is
[47:04] taking place because it will react
[47:06] almost instantaneously to that type of
[47:08] debasement it has in the past I think
[47:10] that will actually increase once it
[47:11] becomes more stable that will become
[47:12] more prevalent and more obvious because
[47:15] there will only be that one major
[47:16] activity of monetary debasement that
[47:18] really sort of sets it off um that will
[47:22] result in lawmakers going oh man look at
[47:24] that we we can't keep doing this or are
[47:27] going to leave to bitcoin where when
[47:30] because they're going to know that we're
[47:30] going to keep debasing the currency and
[47:32] so I view Bitcoin as sort of like a a
[47:34] mirror um reflection device a response
[47:38] to debasement um that will take place
[47:40] and it will be more prevalent in the
[47:41] future and so it will act as more of
[47:43] like a check and balance against runaway
[47:46] monetary debasement I don't think we're
[47:47] ever going to in my lifetime be rid of
[47:50] flexible currencies I think Bitcoin will
[47:53] make flexible currencies more
[47:54] responsible that that AIT wealth uh it's
[47:57] the same as like when when Twitter knows
[47:59] nostril here Twitter might be better to
[48:02] greatest than than that they really
[48:04] really cool it seems like that uh US
[48:07] dollar euro and Bricks is like it will
[48:09] come down to like those those those
[48:11] three big ones even though we have so
[48:13] many currencies right now uh but with
[48:16] stable coins uh and and all those things
[48:20] uh doesn't I think we we don't need that
[48:23] many currency at all it's like there
[48:25] will be three four big ones no the US
[48:27] dollar is like 90% of the global market
[48:29] so I don't I don't think the US dollar
[48:30] is going anywhere anytime soon I think
[48:31] people like to pretend and there's
[48:33] efforts underway all the time to subvert
[48:35] the US dollar and have bricks or have
[48:37] something else or the Yen come through I
[48:39] just don't really believe this idea that
[48:42] the world is going to trust China with
[48:45] their monetary policy and the way that
[48:47] they treat their currency I don't think
[48:49] they're going to trust that more than
[48:50] the American system I could be wrong but
[48:52] that's my that's you know I stand on
[48:54] that really cool perfect then let's come
[48:57] to the tin I switched the tin up today a
[49:00] little bit uh as I want to try a new
[49:03] form of it um what advice do you
[49:06] generally have for the average bitcoiner
[49:09] oh that's a great question my advice is
[49:12] if you're new to bitcoin uh learn about
[49:14] Bitcoin as quietly as you possibly can
[49:16] because your opinions of Bitcoin will
[49:18] radically change over the next four
[49:20] years when I found Bitcoin in 2017 I had
[49:23] many opinions and many thoughts uh
[49:25] ultimately many of them were just
[49:26] destroyed or proven to be incorrect uh
[49:29] and it's always best to learn uh learn
[49:31] and make mistakes quietly uh my second
[49:33] one would be I would say do everything
[49:36] you can to to educate those around you I
[49:39] mean listen don't be the annoying one
[49:42] that that you know the the kitchen table
[49:43] when no one wants to hear about it but
[49:45] be but just arm yourself with enough
[49:47] information or arm yourself with enough
[49:48] resources from organizations like
[49:50] Satoshi action or others in the space so
[49:52] that when the questions come up when the
[49:54] when the conversation does happen that
[49:55] you're there and you're ready you're
[49:56] sharp you're ready to go don't be like
[49:59] pestering people but what's going to
[50:01] happen is Bitcoin is going to go up this
[50:02] always happens all the haters all the
[50:04] doubters when Bitcoin goes up then
[50:07] they're going to ask questions and
[50:08] you're going to be ready because you've
[50:09] been studying and being researching and
[50:11] also have access to Great tools we have
[50:13] some tools on our website you're welcome
[50:14] to share them um there are many other
[50:16] great tools out there better than ours
[50:18] is even as well we're I wouldn't say
[50:19] that's our best feature but we
[50:20] definitely do have some resources and we
[50:22] are also if you meet a lawmaker who
[50:24] reaches out to you and they want to
[50:25] learn more about the technology we are
[50:27] more than happy to do the education for
[50:28] you given that that's sort of our
[50:30] specialty really cool thank you so much
[50:33] uh we have the end te also the last one
[50:35] where the previous guest is asking a
[50:36] question for the next guest without
[50:38] knowing who the next guest actually is
[50:40] it's an interesting one especially for
[50:41] you uh assuming we all live within a
[50:44] Bitcoin standard already and you have
[50:46] achieved Financial Freedom how would you
[50:48] choose to spend your time oh assuming we
[50:51] Achieve Financial Freedom and we're in a
[50:53] Bitcoin standard how would I choose to
[50:56] use my time I mean I listen I I I don't
[50:58] think I would change too much I mean I'm
[51:01] I've been doing Bitcoin for seven years
[51:02] I don't see myself doing anything
[51:04] different going into the future you know
[51:06] there may be some different ways that I
[51:08] approach to technology but I couldn't be
[51:11] doing anything different I wouldn't do
[51:13] anything different I'm very happy with
[51:14] where I am with what I'm doing um it's
[51:17] been an honor to advocate for Bitcoin
[51:19] and to secure so many great wins for the
[51:20] technology in such a short period of
[51:22] time and you know we're on the edge of
[51:26] the frontier so why why would I want to
[51:28] be doing anything else with my time
[51:30] absolutely thank you so much Dennis for
