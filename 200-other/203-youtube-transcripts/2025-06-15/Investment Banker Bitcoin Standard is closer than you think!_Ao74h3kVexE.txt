[00:00] in some places it will be a store of
[00:01] value in some places it would have
[00:03] completely eaten the fiat currency and
[00:05] the suddenly moment is there while we're
[00:08] still in the gradual moment I never
[00:09] questioned the dollar like who questions
[00:12] the dollar the problem with gold is at
[00:14] some point once it gets as valuable as
[00:17] gold got you get into a problem which is
[00:19] how do I subdivide it into more pieces
[00:22] so you need to look for a substitute in
[00:24] that case people started using silver
[00:26] but with Bitcoin because it's digital
[00:29] that changes everything most things I
[00:31] learned in Bitcoin I had no idea about
[00:35] throughout my entire career we need more
[00:37] sales people in Bitcoin we have a lot of
[00:39] Genius Builders but I think we need more
[00:42] sales people I think and we need to
[00:44] convince the rich crowd people with a
[00:46] lot of money to get
[00:50] in i l your first pin tweet and I just
[00:54] want to get in with this tweet and then
[00:56] we get in all the other topics from
[00:58] there you said everything is going to
[01:01] zero against Bitcoin mhm why is that the
[01:04] reason I tweeted that was because I was
[01:07] a little bit frustrated to be honest
[01:10] that I had to keep answering the same
[01:13] questions all over again but that's
[01:17] probably because it we're so early still
[01:20] in Bitcoin and uh the questions are
[01:23] usually what about this other coin you
[01:26] know what about the dollar price of
[01:30] Bitcoin right and all these questions
[01:34] that we bitcoiners keep hearing that
[01:36] they come over and over and over again
[01:39] and I love for example the website I'm
[01:41] pretty sure you know priced in Bitcoin
[01:44] yes it's amazing yeah so that website is
[01:48] pure signal by the way anyone anyone who
[01:52] hasn't seen it yet just go check it out
[01:54] maybe you can put it in your show notes
[01:56] it's a really good one so basically what
[01:58] what what uh they do is they price
[02:01] everything in Bitcoin and uh the moment
[02:05] you check the list there it's just all
[02:09] going down everything is trending in One
[02:13] Direction which is towards zero so
[02:18] everything priced like real estate gold
[02:22] dollars any other cryptocurrency
[02:25] anything as soon as you change the
[02:27] denominator and you start pric ing
[02:30] things in BTC you have a completely
[02:33] different picture and that picture is
[02:36] everything is going down nothing is
[02:39] actually going up everything is going
[02:41] down yeah it's it's we talked a little
[02:44] bit about before was investing and stuff
[02:47] um once you adopt the Bitcoin standard
[02:49] it's really hard to make any other
[02:51] Investments it's like the it becomes the
[02:53] new hurle rate you think about any
[02:56] bigger investment twice for me it does
[02:58] not uh doesn't not um change the way I
[03:02] think when I'm in the supermarket yeah
[03:05] but anything above like a, or at least
[03:07] even the 500 I think about it twice like
[03:10] this could be some Bitcoins this could
[03:12] be some zs like why don't I do it in
[03:14] Bitcoin rather then do I really need
[03:17] that right now yeah yeah it's it's also
[03:19] a mindset right and it takes time I mean
[03:21] for me it took years until I started
[03:23] really thinking like that right so I
[03:27] started in November 18 that was the
[03:29] first first time I really got into the
[03:31] topic you know and you know you start I
[03:35] mean everybody starts from a different
[03:37] angle but my start was because I have a
[03:39] financial background my start was hey I
[03:42] want to I want to make money you know I
[03:45] want to make more dollars I want to make
[03:46] more more Euros right whatever that
[03:48] currency is that you price everything in
[03:51] so that's how I got started and um from
[03:55] there once you really dive into this
[03:58] topic you at some point change the
[04:02] denominator the denominator right so
[04:04] everything you look at every investment
[04:06] every purchasing decision you said it
[04:09] right anything above a certain threshold
[04:12] that you actually care about spending it
[04:15] because it's a higher amount you think
[04:18] twice like do I really really really
[04:20] need that right now like should I really
[04:23] buy that or should I just wait and just
[04:27] hold Bitcoin yeah that's that's so true
[04:30] also before we go into your tra trade F
[04:32] story which I'm really interested in um
[04:34] you also said before when new people
[04:37] come into Bitcoin they always ask the
[04:39] same questions for example like what's
[04:41] the next Bitcoin I got that a lot like
[04:43] oh Bitcoin is interesting but can you
[04:45] refer any other coins yeah I always ask
[04:49] myself why is that I think the one thing
[04:51] is probably unit buyers do do you have
[04:53] like is is unit buyas because Bitcoin is
[04:55] priced so high in terms of like one
[04:58] Bitcoin uh is that the major thing or
[05:01] what does people why do people not tend
[05:03] towards Bitcoin in the first place and
[05:04] then like oh let's let's see if there's
[05:06] something else I think there is many
[05:09] reasons and uh you know how it is right
[05:13] as bitcoiners because we have already
[05:15] pass that threshold of understanding
[05:18] it's very hard to remember what we
[05:20] thought before that right that's very
[05:22] once you wake up from the Matrix it's
[05:24] very hard to believe or or have empathy
[05:28] with the with the other world how they
[05:29] think right so it's the same or a
[05:31] similar thing but if I try to
[05:33] remember it's just confusion it's the
[05:37] lack of understanding what money is how
[05:41] money works and the game theory behind
[05:44] money right and if you just study this
[05:48] topic long enough you realize and I love
[05:51] the piece of um Parker
[05:55] Lewis in his gradually then suddenly
[05:58] series
[06:00] specifically I mean one piece of that
[06:03] series completely changed my mindset was
[06:07] where he says that monetary
[06:12] mediums Trend to a
[06:15] single
[06:17] unit so over
[06:20] time the market the open free market
[06:24] actually doesn't want multiple
[06:25] currencies for a very simple reason we
[06:28] want convenience we want to agree on one
[06:31] unit to price things right no actually
[06:35] if you studied gold for example how gold
[06:38] emerged and how it really got into the
[06:41] place it got it was not like a
[06:43] government showed up and said hey gold
[06:45] is the currency right now right it was
[06:48] an emergence over time where humans
[06:52] chose gold over other monetary mediums
[06:56] and we converged on gold over time
[07:00] as the most or the single most used form
[07:04] of money right because of the game
[07:07] theory behind uh money right which is a
[07:13] winner take all game right it's a winner
[07:16] take all game you cannot it's
[07:19] inconvenient for people to uh start
[07:23] using multiple currencies to trade right
[07:25] it's very inconvenient it it's hard for
[07:28] the accounting system it has hundreds of
[07:31] reasons right that we could dive into
[07:33] but uh that's the main reason why you
[07:37] cannot actually have another
[07:41] Bitcoin and like if we for example look
[07:45] at gold for example we could say okay
[07:47] wait a second rusbe we had gold we had
[07:51] silver true but the difference there is
[07:55] gold is made of atoms gold is physical
[07:59] right the problem with gold is at some
[08:02] point once it gets very value or as
[08:05] valuable as gold got you got you get
[08:08] into a problem which is how do I
[08:12] subdivide it into more pieces even if
[08:15] this amount of gold is already worth
[08:17] hundreds of thousands of dollars right
[08:18] or purchasing power right so you need to
[08:21] look for a substitute in that case
[08:23] people started using silver right but
[08:27] with Bitcoin because it's digital
[08:31] that changes everything right because
[08:34] finally we have a scarce digital good
[08:38] that we can actually divide
[08:42] infinitely and and one and another thing
[08:45] that I want to add here is like isn't
[08:48] Bitcoin the first thing that is truly
[08:51] just there for money when you look at
[08:53] gold it has also use cases in in other
[08:56] uh Realms like it's industrial use it's
[08:59] all all smartphones in there yes like
[09:01] Bitcoin is kind of the first thing that
[09:03] just is money yeah and I think that's
[09:06] what a lot of people don't get right yes
[09:08] and I want to steal a quote from a
[09:11] friend a fellow
[09:12] bitcoiner uh he knows who he knows that
[09:16] I'm talking about him don't want to
[09:17] mention his name um he says it very
[09:21] nicely he says we actually never had
[09:25] money we never had money before Bitcoin
[09:28] we only had sub substitutes or mimics of
[09:32] perfect
[09:33] money right so for the first time in
[09:36] human history we have something that has
[09:40] perfected every aspect of what humans
[09:44] have always been looking
[09:46] for right to do Commerce to do trade
[09:50] freely without having the issues of
[09:55] reification
[09:57] trust transportation
[10:00] and uh divisibility and all these issues
[10:04] that we had and just gold was just the
[10:07] only thing we had right so we didn't
[10:08] have anything else so we the market
[10:11] forces converged onto gold because there
[10:13] was no alternative right and I would
[10:15] argue right now there is no alternative
[10:19] to Bitcoin today although we're so early
[10:22] and Bitcoin is very small compared to
[10:25] gold or any other monetary asset but
[10:28] yeah so
[10:30] I would say Bitcoin
[10:33] is a form of money that solves every
[10:39] problem humans have been trying to solve
[10:42] for hundreds if not thousands of years
[10:46] it's finally here very few see it yet
[10:50] and that's why we're early and that's
[10:51] why it's a huge opportunity in my
[10:53] opinion and that's why uh we should
[10:55] spread the word and and let as many
[10:58] people know as we can it's I I love it
[11:01] already it's really cool uh and
[11:03] especially like we are so like go in any
[11:06] Forum that talks about cryptos not
[11:08] Bitcoin talk in any form they talk about
[11:10] real estate or gold and ask there hey
[11:13] what do what guy what do you guys think
[11:15] about Bitcoin then you know how early we
[11:17] are yes yes it's amazing um but let's
[11:21] come to your uh trade F traditional
[11:24] Finance uh background yes um maybe start
[11:27] in the beginning like how did you get
[11:28] started with traditional Finance uh and
[11:31] then what did you do there and then we
[11:33] can see how you or why you switched to
[11:35] bitcoin yes sure uh before we jump there
[11:38] I I I think I forgot a point I wanted to
[11:40] make uh with the question regarding
[11:42] altcoins or any other cryptocurrency
[11:45] because I think this is a question that
[11:46] many people have in their head and it's
[11:48] still not very clear because we just
[11:50] explained Bitcoin is divisible and so on
[11:52] and so forth so unit bias is one problem
[11:56] but the other thing is not understanding
[11:58] Network
[12:00] effects right and what do I mean by that
[12:03] so for example we use for communication
[12:05] most of the time here in Europe we use
[12:08] WhatsApp yeah right that's an app that
[12:11] we are used to and that has the most
[12:13] Network effect if I now come to you and
[12:16] say hey Robin I have a new app only I
[12:19] use it it's more it's faster it's better
[12:22] looking it's lighter it's more
[12:25] private right privacy is a problem with
[12:28] WhatsApp
[12:31] try to convince hundreds of your friends
[12:34] to join you
[12:36] okay very difficult if not impossible
[12:40] right however let's take the argument
[12:43] that it is possible that because you
[12:45] like me you want to stay in touch with
[12:46] me and I don't use any other application
[12:49] you will do me the favor and download
[12:50] the application okay it's still somehow
[12:54] possible but it's very difficult to
[12:56] convince you you you're even reluctant
[12:58] to do it even though it's just an
[12:59] application you have no loss of doing it
[13:03] right now let's talk about money if I
[13:06] come and say hey I have a new new form
[13:08] of money Robin that I produced in my
[13:10] basement I promise there is a certain
[13:14] amount of it just believe me it's better
[13:17] than Bitcoin it's faster than Bitcoin
[13:19] and it has this amazing you know
[13:23] possibilities of doing smart contracts
[13:24] and all sorts of
[13:26] things like how difficult is it
[13:30] to gain the same network effect that the
[13:33] most dominant alternative already has
[13:36] even if you're more private even if
[13:38] you're
[13:40] faster it is impossible right it's very
[13:44] difficult it's difficult already with a
[13:46] normal messaging app it's even more
[13:49] difficult with a monetary asset why
[13:53] because in order to convince you to do
[13:56] what I just told you you have to have
[13:59] have you have to
[14:02] sell the monetary asset that most people
[14:05] use in order to buy
[14:07] mine so you have also a monetary
[14:10] disincentive to do
[14:14] that right with a messaging app it's
[14:17] already difficult but there at least you
[14:19] don't have any you know monetary
[14:22] disadvantage if you do switch or add it
[14:25] into the existing apps that you use with
[14:29] monetary networks that's not that's not
[14:30] true because you always have an
[14:31] opportunity cost if you don't hold
[14:33] Bitcoin you have to hold something else
[14:36] and if you just look over the past four
[14:38] years any alternative to
[14:41] bitcoin has not gone up against Bitcoin
[14:45] everything is down if you look four plus
[14:48] years back so just wanted to add that as
[14:51] a context because a lot of people say
[14:53] okay wait I get it with gold it's
[14:56] divisibility whatever but what about the
[14:58] alternative coins right and it's also
[15:01] money is the most viral thing yeah uh
[15:05] and it spreads faster and better than
[15:08] any other form of uh assets or
[15:11] communication whatever um but then um is
[15:16] that why it might take long to break
[15:19] feat even though feat is so bad like you
[15:22] hold it you will you know that you will
[15:24] lose all your purchasing power over 50
[15:27] 60 years over your lifetime you will
[15:28] lose
[15:29] everything um and still people like ah
[15:32] no I I trust the government no it's it's
[15:34] okay it's it's like it's it's stable in
[15:36] the short term um is that the reason why
[15:39] they hold on to it so much that's an
[15:41] excellent point I love it so exactly
[15:44] that's exactly the point I'm trying to
[15:46] make right let's not even stay here in
[15:48] Europe let's go somewhere where the
[15:50] currency even is even 100 times worse
[15:54] okay let's go to Turkey
[15:56] okay what's the most dominant currency
[15:59] Turkish
[16:00] L what's the inflation rate in Turkey
[16:04] hundreds of
[16:06] percent Network effects are insanely
[16:10] powerful insanely powerful right
[16:13] everything is priced in it right and
[16:16] even if even if you go to Turkey you you
[16:19] will see a lot of uh taxi drivers and
[16:21] hotels have started pricing things in
[16:24] Euros right because their currency is
[16:26] just really it's terrible right they
[16:30] have lost so much of their purchasing
[16:32] power over the past few years but still
[16:35] the currency is Turkish L at the end at
[16:38] the at the moment of payment you have to
[16:40] exchange it for Turkish Lera in order to
[16:43] pay the person
[16:47] however the this is the mistake that a
[16:50] lot of uh bitcoiners who are in the US
[16:53] and by the way I'm Iranian so I I can
[16:56] empathize from the side of the Middle
[16:59] East more than probably most bitcoiners
[17:01] who live in the US and who grow up in a
[17:04] fairly more stable economy right
[17:09] so we don't have to have a fiat currency
[17:13] die for Bitcoin to succeed in fact I
[17:18] believe that none of us will be able to
[17:21] see most Fiat currencies die in our
[17:25] lifetimes okay look at our Argentina
[17:30] look at turkey look at uh Iran look at
[17:34] all these countries right where their
[17:36] currency is has been dis has been has
[17:40] been disrupted for how many years and
[17:44] they're still working but people do not
[17:47] use it to store their wealth with right
[17:51] so we can go on for tens of
[17:54] years I mean the dollar will be the last
[17:57] currency to to vanish from planet Earth
[17:59] that I can be 100% sure because it's
[18:01] even more used outside of the US than in
[18:05] the US right because it's a world
[18:06] Reserve currency so Bitcoin could go
[18:09] easily to millions of dollars per
[18:13] coin and we would still be around
[18:16] pricing things in dollars paying each
[18:21] other for Commerce in
[18:24] dollars you talked before about that par
[18:28] Louis where it's about slowly then
[18:31] suddenly this moment yes even if we on
[18:33] this suddenly Trend you think that we
[18:36] still in a in a feared world I had last
[18:39] time a guest on rogard Sony I don't know
[18:40] if you know him uh he also said like
[18:43] even if we at the million US Dollars
[18:46] yeah most people will still not have
[18:48] adopted Bitcoin even as a store of value
[18:50] because uh the big money will come in
[18:53] and then uh it we we're coming to a
[18:56] million dollar price even without Mass
[18:58] adoption from retail like 10% uh maybe
[19:01] 15% of people adopting is is is all that
[19:04] we need um do you see Bitcoin as that
[19:07] big store of value and maybe never
[19:09] getting to a medium of exchange because
[19:11] government don't want to give it
[19:14] up no and I'll tell you why it's
[19:18] actually a very good question so here's
[19:20] the thing what's the difference between
[19:22] Bitcoin and gold gold was analog money
[19:27] and Bitcoin is is digital sound money
[19:31] right the difference or the main
[19:32] difference is that if you look at Gold's
[19:35] history gold was unable to uh
[19:41] become or let let me start differently
[19:43] so with gold you didn't have a
[19:46] communication Channel and people were
[19:48] not connected like they are today right
[19:51] so gold went through a phase of being a
[19:54] store of value for or even being a
[19:56] collectible first and then it turned
[19:58] turned to a store of value and over
[20:01] hundreds of thousands of years at some
[20:04] point it became a medium of exchange
[20:08] worldwide right with Bitcoin I believe
[20:12] it's going to be different you will have
[20:15] places where it's going to be just a
[20:17] store of
[20:18] value especially in the west probably in
[20:22] most places where the fiat currency is
[20:25] not as you know weak as other places and
[20:29] in some places because the suddenly
[20:32] moment is much quicker Bitcoin will gain
[20:35] more adoption as a medium of exchange
[20:38] and it's already happening as we speak
[20:41] right why because Bitcoin is global
[20:43] Bitcoin lives on the internet Bitcoin is
[20:46] accessible to everybody at the same time
[20:50] with gold gold had to spread over
[20:53] territories over years you know it took
[20:56] very long time for it to be transported
[20:58] and so on and so forth so I think
[21:02] Bitcoin will have a similar path but in
[21:06] every place it will be at different
[21:08] stages in some places it will be a store
[21:11] of value still in some places it would
[21:14] have completely eaten the you know fiat
[21:17] currency and the suddenly moment is
[21:18] there while we're still in the gradual
[21:22] moment I I love it a lot and I also
[21:25] think that Bitcoin is already globally
[21:26] accepted yeah because when you think of
[21:28] like I don't know when you you're in
[21:30] turkey and then you flee to Austria uh
[21:33] and then all of the sudden you're like
[21:34] oh I have my Bitcoin I told the Turkish
[21:36] government that I lost that I lost my
[21:39] Bitcoin I don't know they they got
[21:41] stolen from me uh and then all of the
[21:44] sudden you can go to I don't know waxel
[21:46] or some app they can really meet a
[21:49] physical person and then exchange
[21:51] Bitcoin for local currencies and then
[21:54] buy everything with that that's already
[21:56] globally in every all I don't know if
[21:59] every County but Pro probably in almost
[22:01] every country you can do that today
[22:03] that's already globally like it's
[22:05] accepted everywhere you can find in
[22:07] every County someone that is willing to
[22:09] change the local currency for your
[22:11] Bitcoin show me one place that would
[22:13] accept gold as a medium of exchange that
[22:17] doesn't exist doesn't exist but with
[22:20] Bitcoin I could go right now to El
[22:22] Salvador I could go to so many places
[22:25] not only El Salvador there is so many I
[22:27] mean El Salvador is the famous uh
[22:29] example because they have announced that
[22:32] it's a it's a legal tender currency
[22:35] right but there is so many places I
[22:37] heard my my brother was uh last year in
[22:41] Cyprus he was like R I can pay I can pay
[22:45] almost everywhere here with Bitcoin like
[22:46] real estate I can buy with Bitcoin I can
[22:49] there's shops accepting Bitcoin like you
[22:51] know it's emerging in places because
[22:54] Cyprus is also you know the history in
[22:56] Cypress right they they like the these
[22:59] areas they have really gone through a
[23:01] lot of struggle they know what it means
[23:04] if the bank shuts the doors right
[23:08] they're used to that so these places who
[23:11] still remember I mean Germany doesn't
[23:13] remember hyperinflation we were not
[23:15] around 100 100 it was exactly 100 years
[23:17] ago but none of us remember what Happ I
[23:20] mean you're in Austria but you know I'm
[23:22] from Germany so no German would be able
[23:26] to tell you or remember what happened
[23:28] years ago but Germany went through a
[23:31] hyperinflation just 100 years
[23:34] ago it's unbelievable that actually it's
[23:37] not a long time ago 100 100 years ago is
[23:40] not that long ago yeah it it's
[23:44] fascinating how how we see it um yeah
[23:47] let's let's come to the ACT question
[23:48] that I had yes yeah sorry I I I have to
[23:51] go back a step because I wanted to to
[23:53] clarify I love it it was really cool but
[23:55] let's uh let's come to your trade fed
[23:57] history you started there like why did
[24:00] you start there so uh my career started
[24:04] in ' 07 so it was pretty much the very
[24:08] beginning of the financial
[24:10] crisis um I started working in an
[24:15] investment Bank as an intern I liked it
[24:18] a lot I tried other you know Industries
[24:22] I didn't like it I I tried like shipping
[24:24] and stuff like that import export stuff
[24:27] not really my thing and I started
[24:29] working in Investment Banking I was very
[24:32] young I was like 19 this this was the
[24:35] start and um from
[24:39] there I observed as a very young
[24:43] individual the financial crisis you know
[24:46] it
[24:46] was unbelievable I mean back then I
[24:50] didn't I didn't think of it much I
[24:52] realized later what I actually
[24:54] experienced because for me everything
[24:56] was new anyways and it was you know I
[24:59] remember my boss came into the office
[25:01] and he said uh the day Leman went
[25:05] bankrupt he came in and he asked me hey
[25:08] rusel what's up like any news in the
[25:11] market and I was like yeah oil is at
[25:13] like oil price was at like $100
[25:16] something dollars and I just gave him
[25:18] the oil price you know we were I was at
[25:19] the dealing desk and he asked me hey
[25:22] what's what's what's new and I told him
[25:24] uh the oil price and you know my
[25:27] coworker looked at looks at me and then
[25:29] looks at him and says Leman is bankrupt
[25:32] and he goes like
[25:34] what and I was like uh yeah Leman is
[25:38] bankrupt whatever you know but it was
[25:41] oil price about oil price yeah but yeah
[25:43] it was it was insane it was really
[25:46] really H crazy I mean the
[25:48] markets uh were so volatile and we were
[25:51] dealing with clients
[25:54] mainly hedge funds I mean we had our own
[25:57] hedge funds in the bank but we were
[25:59] working with external hedge funds who
[26:01] placed their trades with us H so I was
[26:04] in the middle of all of this and um you
[26:08] know I mean later on I I lived in many
[26:11] places after that I I lived in the US
[26:13] for a while then in Dubai for a while
[26:15] then in Switzerland for a while and I
[26:17] just kept staying in the same
[26:19] industry went a little bit to Commercial
[26:24] Banking as well did some boring stuff
[26:26] like payments and trade finance and
[26:27] stuff like that
[26:28] but the main part of my career was in
[26:31] Investment Banking and you know I'm also
[26:34] like a person um I'm also a very
[26:37] spiritual person uh started in 11 uh
[26:43] really focusing on some gurus I followed
[26:46] like eat to is a great great person that
[26:49] I started to follow and later on Ellen
[26:52] wats and stuff like that so uh I I'm
[26:54] really also interested in uh topics like
[26:57] philosophy and religion not really
[27:00] religion but you know these topics like
[27:02] philosophical um uh topics and I and why
[27:07] do I say that I was actually never able
[27:10] to link these two worlds with each
[27:13] other like my career in banking was
[27:18] always linked to an ego that had to
[27:23] basically lie to be
[27:26] successful because the game the basic
[27:30] game of banking is you
[27:34] benefit if your clients don't know or
[27:38] lose that's how it goes that that's
[27:41] literally how it goes and you don't
[27:42] think of it like in bad ways because
[27:44] you're like you just accept reality the
[27:47] way it is you're like this is the way it
[27:49] is I if I don't do that I'm not going to
[27:52] be successful so I have to do it right
[27:55] that that's also one reason why many
[27:57] people in traditional Finance are
[27:59] trapped because the
[28:02] incentive is to lie the incentive is to
[28:06] cheat the incentive is to sell something
[28:09] you don't believe in right and I was
[28:13] thinking similarly until
[28:16] Bitcoin you know in
[28:19] 2017 I heard of it for the first time
[28:22] ignored it didn't think any of it like
[28:26] at all in 8 18 was my first time where I
[28:29] got really involved and bought some
[28:32] amount that I thought of being a lot for
[28:34] me that back then and from there I just
[28:37] went deeper and deeper and deeper and uh
[28:41] sorry to become a little bit
[28:43] philosophical but uh I thought it's very
[28:45] interesting to share this because it was
[28:47] also a very Awakening moment for me so I
[28:49] was listening to uh gu Swan you know him
[28:53] obviously and he was reading this
[28:57] article of of um Robert
[29:01] Breedlove uh the article's name was the
[29:05] number
[29:06] zero and when I was listening to that
[29:09] article I was like oh my
[29:14] God this is this is actually a financial
[29:18] product that is completely
[29:21] ethical like you have something that is
[29:24] actually
[29:26] win-win it's not loose because we have
[29:30] Fair rules on the very very base
[29:34] level of having a fixed
[29:37] unit that everybody has to
[29:41] share there is no way to produce more in
[29:45] the unit of the of the of the medium
[29:48] that we're going to use and price things
[29:50] in and that was like Wow and that was I
[29:55] would say that was like the most orange
[29:57] ping I had many orange ping moments but
[29:59] that was one of the most amazing orange
[30:01] ping moments because the Two Worlds that
[30:04] I always like separated from each other
[30:07] finally converged and I was like so now
[30:11] I can be ethical I don't have to lie I
[30:14] can be honest I can talk about something
[30:19] and be completely passionate about it
[30:22] and love it and believe in it and win
[30:27] While others also
[30:28] win which is the exact opposite of the
[30:31] Fiat
[30:32] system right so that was my transition
[30:36] from you know traditional Finance I got
[30:38] into Bitcoin not as early as some others
[30:42] but I wish I had but I didn't so yeah
[30:46] that was a transition for me yeah I
[30:47] already talked with some ogs that are
[30:49] over 10 years in the space and I'm so
[30:52] Envy yeah yeah I mean even though I was
[30:55] 14 but yeah but I could have heard of it
[30:59] because I was actually in finance you I
[31:01] was working but uh I didn't so I I have
[31:05] no regrets to be honest because no one
[31:07] ever told me about it and it was not
[31:09] like I ignored it and then the price
[31:12] went up you know I the moment I actually
[31:15] ignored it the price came down so I was
[31:18] able to buy a little bit cheaper than
[31:20] the first time I heard of it so that was
[31:22] a good part so yeah it's usually you
[31:25] ignore it the pry shoots up 100% then
[31:27] you buy it then it goes down 50% that's
[31:29] the usual process exactly exactly was
[31:33] also with me like that yes yes I mean
[31:35] the first time I heard about it was in
[31:37] was in December 17 then I was like let
[31:42] me buy some I was living in Zurich and I
[31:44] just I will never forget that day I took
[31:46] my credit card and I bought like 700
[31:49] Swiss Franks of Bitcoin and then it just
[31:51] went down and down and down and down it
[31:55] went from
[31:56] 177,000 all the way down to six and I
[31:59] was like that's it I'm going to sell so
[32:01] I sold and I was like before it goes to
[32:03] zero let me just sell it I I didn't have
[32:05] a clue what I what I even bought right
[32:07] so and then you bought again and then
[32:10] after like because my brother was into
[32:12] it he kept telling me about it and
[32:15] because he was doing business with it
[32:17] like uh I he about it from him again and
[32:21] I was like you know what I'm just going
[32:23] to
[32:24] buy and maybe I can tell you that story
[32:28] as well so the moment I bought it was in
[32:30] November 18 everybody can go and check
[32:33] the price November 18 I bought at around
[32:36] like
[32:40] 5,800 4 days after I bought it crashed
[32:46] %. and I was like what the heck like it
[32:49] went from 55 to
[32:52] 32 and I was like but that this time I'm
[32:55] not going to you know just held and held
[32:57] and you know you know where the price is
[32:59] right now so I never sold those coins
[33:02] really cool yeah thank you you already
[33:04] made it halfway through the video and
[33:06] I'm really really grateful to have you
[33:08] here two things make this channel
[33:10] possible you as a watcher and listener
[33:12] who keep supporting this Channel and
[33:15] another one is all the Bitcoin brands
[33:17] that I partner up with like 21 Bitcoin
[33:20] who support me from the very start and
[33:22] where I personally buy my Bitcoin from
[33:24] with code Robin you even get a discount
[33:26] when you buy Bitcoin with them and now
[33:28] also bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[33:31] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[33:34] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[33:37] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[33:39] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[33:41] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[33:45] bracket and if you have self- custody
[33:47] and you know your friend does not have
[33:49] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[33:50] he needs a birth present and a small
[33:53] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[33:55] 5% off your order Plus you support my
[33:58] channel and now let's get back to the
[34:00] video yeah it's it's like Bitcoin um
[34:04] rewards the patient people that actually
[34:07] do the research and actually um
[34:11] investigate themselves what Bitcoin is
[34:13] and not just like blindly follow someone
[34:16] or something like because if you just
[34:18] copy someone you will get out at some
[34:20] point yeah if it crashes down 50 60% it
[34:23] all like they they will get out of the
[34:26] Bitcoin and that's that's such a
[34:27] beautiful thing to have in Bitcoin uh
[34:30] and it's also like this this Fair
[34:32] instrument Fair asset as you said the
[34:34] ethical asset yes um what maybe which
[34:38] interesting you were a long time in uh
[34:40] the investment banking sector and and
[34:42] traditional Finance if you call it like
[34:44] that what were some learnings from that
[34:47] that you took to to bitcoin something
[34:49] positive from that world that you
[34:51] converted to bitcoin that's a really
[34:53] good question so
[34:55] um first of all let me just before I
[34:58] answer the question say that most things
[35:01] I learned in Bitcoin I had no idea about
[35:06] throughout my entire career like I
[35:09] Bitcoin made me finally realize that I
[35:12] don't know I don't know anything I
[35:15] don't know anything about money I don't
[35:17] know anything about actually Finance I
[35:20] don't know anything like I didn't know
[35:22] my industry this was my realization I
[35:24] don't know much like I I know how
[35:27] markets work uh but I never questioned
[35:30] the dollar like who questions the dollar
[35:33] right so Bitcoin made me question
[35:35] everything but what I did take with me
[35:38] and I have to say that because it really
[35:40] helped was not to
[35:44] trade because I was sitting always on
[35:47] the other side of the table uh because I
[35:49] was a prime broker so we had clients
[35:53] like
[35:54] um you know hedge funds Banks but also
[35:59] individuals who were trading with
[36:02] us I did not trade myself but clients
[36:06] were trading with us right so I saw
[36:08] their
[36:09] portfolios and I saw what happened with
[36:13] them I mean you won't believe it
[36:16] doctors
[36:17] nurses like and even I could not tell
[36:21] them common trade you know I honestly
[36:24] saying I mean there were times where I
[36:26] had to you know not say a lot of things
[36:29] but there were times where I said listen
[36:31] the the chances of you losing money is
[36:33] over
[36:34] 90% And they still did
[36:37] it I had one client he took a loan of
[36:42] $200,000 and lost it everything by
[36:46] trading currencies like you know Forex
[36:48] Trading he traded euro dollar and pound
[36:52] euros and whatever and lost it all you
[36:55] know and I even told him Hey listen this
[36:57] is not a good idea you should probably
[36:59] not do this he still did it but long
[37:01] story short to answer your
[37:04] question in my entire career and it was
[37:07] probably 16 years in being a
[37:11] broker I saw three clients making
[37:16] money
[37:19] three it's insane how like it's it's
[37:23] better to go gamble in a casino than
[37:27] trade
[37:28] and the odds are just so low and there
[37:31] is mathematical reason I could line in
[37:34] front of you and explain to you
[37:37] why we don't have to do that now but you
[37:39] know it's it's very difficult it's
[37:41] extremely difficult especially for
[37:44] people who don't have a lot of capital
[37:46] right because there's something called
[37:48] Leverage in trading that most people use
[37:51] in order to make money quickly and the
[37:54] way that works is you for example Robin
[37:56] come to me and open an account you have
[37:59] only $10,000 but you would like to turn
[38:02] this $10,000 to $20,000 as quickly as
[38:05] possible so if you would go and buy
[38:09] 10,000 with your dollars you would get
[38:13] 9,000 something Euros in exchange
[38:18] because of the exchange rate right but
[38:21] for you to make
[38:23] 20,000 you have to wait for the euro to
[38:28] go up by I don't know how much percent a
[38:30] lot right a lot a huge amount like it
[38:33] doesn't like it it won't make you rich
[38:35] that quickly right so what do you have
[38:38] to do in order to make that possible you
[38:40] have to take a leveraged position right
[38:43] a 1 to 10 position or one to 20 position
[38:47] so you start to trade
[38:49] $100,000 against Euros with
[38:53] 10,000 so you have $10,000 on your
[38:56] account but you're able to 10x leverage
[38:58] that and trade a
[39:02] 100,000 and we were even like the place
[39:04] I worked at not me personally but the
[39:06] banks and the entire industry they offer
[39:09] 1 to 100 leverage wow 1 to 200 if you go
[39:13] to places like that are not really
[39:16] regulated like plus 500 and all those
[39:19] eoro and all those gambling terrible
[39:22] terrible companies in my opinion they do
[39:25] evil in my opinion if you go there they
[39:27] give you 500 to one
[39:31] leverage so people take a huge amount of
[39:35] risk which can make them a lot of money
[39:39] but and it might but the problem is your
[39:42] psychology doesn't work that way the
[39:44] moment you make
[39:46] $1,000 out of your 10,000 guess what
[39:49] you're going to
[39:50] do you're going to close the position
[39:52] yeah right but the moment you make a a
[39:56] loss of $11,000
[39:58] guess what guess what you're going to do
[40:00] you're going to leave it open and wait
[40:04] that's a psychology of humans they they
[40:06] don't like losses they love profits but
[40:09] they don't like losses so they keep the
[40:11] losses going and going and going and
[40:13] they limit their
[40:15] profits right and with a leverage
[40:17] position one move can Margin Call you
[40:21] and you're at zero instantly right so
[40:24] that's why the odds are completely
[40:26] against do in fact if you look at the FX
[40:30] Market how big is it $6 trillion in
[40:33] volume year-over-year so sorry not
[40:36] year-over year daily turnover wow daily
[40:40] turnover it's the biggest Market in the
[40:41] world FX market right currency market so
[40:45] the Fiat Market if you will so h on a
[40:48] daily basis the volume is around 5 to
[40:50] Six Trillion every day volume being
[40:53] traded right out of that volume n over
[40:58] 90% of Traders lose
[41:01] money now imagine how much money the 10%
[41:04] is actually making the hedge funds the
[41:07] guys with the big Pockets right who
[41:09] don't take the leverage that you take
[41:12] they they making 90% of the profit
[41:14] exactly yeah that's how it
[41:16] works is this um that's why to answer
[41:19] the question that's why I never got into
[41:21] trading Bitcoin right I never traded my
[41:23] Bitcoin I would never trade my Bitcoin
[41:26] because of these reasons because I
[41:28] learned that from my career that trading
[41:31] is a bad idea just don't trade so hling
[41:35] you got from trade F yeah as a negative
[41:38] learning yes so I never actually learned
[41:41] that hodling is the answer but I knew
[41:44] that trading is not the
[41:47] answer and I studied Bitcoin and I
[41:50] studied gold as well I actually started
[41:52] with gold and then went to bitcoin and I
[41:55] and I just looked at the chart and I
[41:57] obviously through my career I also had
[41:59] learned how to read charts do analysis
[42:02] on charts and stuff like that and I did
[42:04] that with Bitcoin I was like at no point
[42:07] in this
[42:09] history could you have known when to
[42:12] time the market it's impossible right
[42:14] but if you would just hold it you would
[42:17] have made hundreds if not thousands of
[42:24] percent it's fascinating I having my my
[42:26] ear the the power LW guys
[42:31] yes I I made a episode with javanni and
[42:35] it was really interesting how he
[42:36] explains it and then I also like asked
[42:39] especially before I asked for some
[42:41] guests for for questions from the
[42:43] community and I did it also with sailor
[42:44] and everyone like ask him for ask him
[42:47] for the power ask him for the power and
[42:48] I'm like n sorry I won't do that I know
[42:51] his answer for that because he is the
[42:54] opinion that every model will break at
[42:55] some point it's just at some point
[42:57] matter of time and for like hey what
[43:01] happens to the power model if the fre
[43:04] top manager at Apple like Tim Cook and
[43:07] and two others decide why not put 10% of
[43:11] our reserves in Bitcoin plus we will
[43:14] make out of our Apple watch our iPhone
[43:17] and the mac and multi signature wallet
[43:19] for everyone to use and it will ship
[43:21] with the Next Generation yes when this
[43:23] breaks tomorrow what will the price do
[43:26] it will break the power model like in a
[43:28] day yes so so it's interesting for me
[43:32] and just hodling is is the best is the
[43:34] best thing 100% I agree
[43:37] totally I agree go ahead you have um uh
[43:41] this this Korean trade F now you got
[43:43] into Bitcoin what are you now doing in
[43:45] Bitcoin so uh I started with my
[43:49] co-founders in um
[43:53] 2021 I because I told you about my
[43:55] background right um originally so I met
[43:58] a few uh I was looking for bitcoiners
[44:02] who are from my country like so
[44:04] desperately because there's so many Alt
[44:07] coiners from that region from Dubai and
[44:10] from Iran it doesn't matter where you go
[44:12] they're all into altcoins unfortunately
[44:14] they're very far away from TR from the
[44:16] truth but time will change that
[44:19] hopefully anyway so I met a few really
[44:22] really nice bitcoiners back in
[44:25] 2021 and we started this um content
[44:32] platform called bitg guide and on bitg
[44:34] guide we started to publish content
[44:38] which is Bitcoin only in farc that was
[44:42] the start of what I do now I mean bitu
[44:45] is still there we still do it with two
[44:47] of my uh friends
[44:49] but among them uh Cena and Zia the three
[44:53] of us we co-founded this company called
[44:56] 2 First Capital in the beginning of this
[44:59] year and basically we
[45:03] believe that one of the most common
[45:08] issues in Bitcoin is
[45:10] custody and the main reason people are
[45:14] hesitating still especially people in
[45:17] their 40s and 50s is because they're not
[45:21] sure how to custody Bitcoin that's why
[45:23] the ETFs are such a big deal right
[45:26] because every everybody was saying hey
[45:27] custody Bitcoin can be complicated for a
[45:30] lot of people so the ETFs are going to
[45:32] be a huge thing right which they are
[45:35] obviously but the world is Big right not
[45:37] a lot of people can access or want to
[45:39] access ETFs and I don't believe ETFs are
[45:42] a good thing and we can talk about that
[45:44] as well but so what we want to achieve
[45:47] at 21st capital is we want to
[45:51] give access to
[45:54] everybody easy access to uh self-
[45:59] custody and we believe that the best way
[46:02] to do that is obviously education that's
[46:05] one thing but the other is I believe the
[46:08] future collaborative custody all right
[46:12] so we working very hard at the moment we
[46:14] are still not there yet but I mean we do
[46:19] uh you know private sessions for for
[46:21] high netw worth individuals who need
[46:23] help with their custody we also do you
[46:26] know classes to very small number of
[46:29] people who really have specific
[46:31] questions and needs for themselves and
[46:34] their family members to learn about
[46:36] specific things that they still have a
[46:37] big question mark about Bitcoin and
[46:39] custody it um we're working very hard to
[46:44] make a platform where people can come to
[46:48] us and say hey I need help with cust my
[46:51] Bitcoin how can I do it and what if I
[46:55] lose my keys right that's the biggest
[46:58] problem what do I do if I lose my keys
[47:01] right so we're working on two solutions
[47:04] at the moment one solution is um a two
[47:07] out of three so the client has two keys
[47:10] we have one key in case the client loses
[47:12] a key he still has us and he has another
[47:15] key and the other solution is that we
[47:20] actually
[47:21] diversify and have an option that if the
[47:26] if if something think if the client
[47:27] loses both keys that we can actually
[47:30] have a backup plan for the customer in
[47:34] case he has no access to any of his keys
[47:37] anymore right and that's actually the
[47:39] innovating part I think not a lot of
[47:42] people talk about this yet because it's
[47:44] pretty new in Bitcoin uh not sure if you
[47:47] had guests who talk about minis scripts
[47:49] but um I think minis scripts are a
[47:54] complete GameChanger they're going to
[47:55] change the way Bitcoin is custody in the
[47:58] future and um the way it works is you
[48:02] can have a time lock of a certain period
[48:06] that a certain multi will get activated
[48:09] if you don't move any
[48:11] money which perfectly solves the issue
[48:15] of losing both of your keys or even you
[48:17] happening something to you and you want
[48:19] the money to you know go to your
[48:22] relative or whoever right so we do this
[48:25] we help individuals we're there for
[48:26] individuals we help them with Consulting
[48:29] and with customing their Bitcoin that's
[48:30] what we do right now and even that alone
[48:33] like this this possibility of time
[48:35] locking I key is fascinating and this is
[48:37] all the the advantages this come to
[48:40] money once it's digital exactly because
[48:43] it's programmable money right it's
[48:45] fascinating for me um but it would be
[48:48] really hard to like um distinguish in
[48:51] the future when we have cbdcs and and
[48:53] they then they sell all the good
[48:54] properties of Bitcoin with the one
[48:56] property they are missing with the sound
[48:58] monetary policy but will be interesting
[49:00] to see um how do you see uh adoption
[49:04] like when you have the traditional
[49:06] Finance background Investment Banking
[49:08] background you talk with uh bitcoiners
[49:10] you talk with people and onboard them
[49:13] ask uh answer bfic questions um what do
[49:17] you see as the one thing that maybe the
[49:19] Bitcoin Community has to do better or we
[49:21] can do better to drive adoption or or
[49:25] how do you see uh us making the Bitcoin
[49:28] adoption better and driving it a little
[49:31] bit
[49:33] faster I would say argue
[49:37] less with each
[49:39] other try to come out of your
[49:43] bubbles being very honest because I
[49:45] really believe that we live in our
[49:47] podcast Bubbles and Conference Bubbles
[49:50] and you know one fork here one fork
[49:54] there and should we have covenants
[49:57] should we not have covenants and all
[49:59] these discussions that I don't think
[50:01] they're bad but I don't think we it's
[50:04] necessary right now right so I I really
[50:08] believe Bitcoin is good enough for 10
[50:13] exing the number of users from here I'm
[50:15] not even talking about price like the
[50:17] users we need more users so in my
[50:21] opinion what the Bitcoin by the way I'm
[50:23] not a fan of the word Community I don't
[50:25] believe there's such thing as a Bitcoin
[50:27] Community because Bitcoin is such a big
[50:31] Network right now that there's lots of
[50:34] Bitcoin communities a lot of people when
[50:36] you say Bitcoin Community they think of
[50:38] Bitcoin Twitter which can be very toxic
[50:41] and um
[50:44] very like intimidating to a lot of
[50:47] people uh however I do think that in the
[50:51] circles as we know them there should be
[50:54] more talk and action towards building
[50:58] stuff that will gain more adoption
[51:01] towards people who want to adopt Bitcoin
[51:04] as a store of value this is why at 21st
[51:07] Capital we have actually put this as our
[51:10] priority we think that um and I have
[51:13] huge respect for people like Jack MERS
[51:15] and you know what he's done with strike
[51:18] with uh all the lightning projects are
[51:21] amazing I love it like I use lightning
[51:24] myself all the time right but I just
[51:27] believe in lightning is necessary in
[51:31] places where
[51:33] Bitcoin is going to be needed as a
[51:35] medium of exchange right but lightning
[51:39] as of right now because of the number of
[51:41] users we have right now is is is is not
[51:46] first priority in my opinion first
[51:48] priority right now is let's enrich
[51:53] Everyone by getting more adoption and
[51:56] how do we get adoption by getting the
[51:59] network filled with more users how do we
[52:02] do that we do that by building more
[52:04] convenient tools by offering more
[52:08] services to high Networth individuals
[52:11] people with a lot of money to feel con
[52:14] to to Don't Fear entering this network
[52:17] right so I see money in general as just
[52:21] a network that's all it is right it's
[52:23] just a network like a telephone it's
[52:25] just a network right right so we have
[52:27] right now the most dominant Network in
[52:29] the world which is the US dollar Network
[52:32] and what we need to do is to make sure
[52:35] our network is more convenient is more
[52:38] friendly and is more easy to access to
[52:41] as many dollar networkers as
[52:45] possible right and who are the and I
[52:48] include everyone who has real estate
[52:50] everyone who has even gold is linked to
[52:52] the dollar right because in order to get
[52:55] out of those assets you need to buy the
[52:58] dollar seller calls them a substitute
[53:01] right they're they're just derivatives
[53:03] of the Fiat currencies right so we need
[53:07] these users especially the large ones
[53:10] who have a lot of purchasing power and I
[53:14] believe the focus should be on the store
[53:17] of value tools we have build them
[53:20] out sell as hard as we can we need more
[53:23] sales people in in in in in in bit coin
[53:27] we have a lot of Genius Builders but I
[53:31] think we need I'm a salesperson so I'm a
[53:35] fan of sales people I think sailor is
[53:37] also an amazing salesperson we need more
[53:39] sales people I think and we need to
[53:41] convince the rich crowd like people with
[53:44] a lot of money to get in because as much
[53:48] as we want to say one Bitcoin equals one
[53:50] Bitcoin I agree but the dollar price
[53:55] matters the number one marketing tool we
[53:58] have is the dollar price of Bitcoin
[54:01] period no discussion like for me that's
[54:05] the like that's where that's the reason
[54:07] most people get in people most people
[54:11] don't get in because they believe like I
[54:14] mean if you are in a rich country if you
[54:17] live in Germany if you live in the US in
[54:20] these countries you don't get into
[54:22] Bitcoin because you
[54:25] believe s sship is important to you
[54:28] right you don't you just simply don't do
[54:31] that because we're not used to
[54:32] censorship if you live in a country like
[54:35] turkey
[54:36] probably Iran most
[54:39] probably but if you live in Western
[54:42] countries and that's where the money is
[54:45] guys like let's focus on these folks
[54:47] like they have the money let's get the
[54:49] money a sailor says let's get the money
[54:52] first we can worry about minimum
[54:54] exchange later so that's my my take on
[54:57] that yeah I also L the Sor uh part where
[55:00] he talked like I think it was like the
[55:02] second part of my podcast where he
[55:04] talked first about sales people like how
[55:06] we how you are a good sales person in
[55:09] Bitcoin and how we should spread Bitcoin
[55:12] with love and not hate and not being
[55:14] against the dollars but being for
[55:15] Bitcoin and all that stuff but then also
[55:18] like uh the China talk was really
[55:21] interesting for me when you talked about
[55:22] like it's good when China adopts Bitcoin
[55:25] it's another discussion if we want to
[55:27] revolutionize China and bring a free
[55:30] world to there that that's not the
[55:32] Bitcoin Mission that's a whole another
[55:34] level that we have to like it's a noble
[55:37] uh thing to do that but we don't have to
[55:40] do it with Bitcoin they can have Bitcoin
[55:42] and put their own restrictions on
[55:43] Bitcoin in their region and when we in
[55:47] in the Western World then we have a more
[55:48] free world and we can use the same
[55:50] Bitcoin and whatever China does does not
[55:52] affect us that was a really interesting
[55:55] uh thing to see um before we get to our
[55:58] Andro I have one more um area topic that
[56:02] I want to go with you um you moved a lot
[56:05] a lot a lot around yes Dubai Swiss
[56:09] Germany now we're in Austria even though
[56:12] you don't live here um why did you move
[56:15] so much around and uh what are you
[56:18] trying to find with the moving what's
[56:21] your what's your version of a great
[56:24] country great question question so let
[56:27] me start by saying the reason I moved
[56:30] was not necessarily because I chose the
[56:34] places I lived in although they're very
[56:36] nice places but most uh of the places
[56:40] I've been was because I saw an
[56:43] opportunity because of work so I did
[56:46] move to those places but to to tell you
[56:50] the truth uh this is a very subjective
[56:53] question as we discussed right before
[56:55] the podcast right it's very difficult
[56:57] like I'm on clubhouse sometimes the guys
[57:01] always keep talking about hey where
[57:03] should we live like what's the best
[57:05] place to live right it's very difficult
[57:07] to say because for example let me give
[57:09] you an example I lived in Dubai for like
[57:11] almost six years right and um if you
[57:15] love nature Dubai is a terrible place to
[57:18] be just terrible because you don't have
[57:22] much there right you have the desert you
[57:25] have
[57:26] camels and you have
[57:29] luxury but that's it right if you love
[57:31] luxury then obviously Dubai is an
[57:33] amazing place right lovely place and
[57:37] relatively affordable for what you can
[57:40] get right so this is that and then there
[57:44] is immigration issues there is family
[57:47] issues or questions that you need to
[57:49] answer so my reason for moving around
[57:53] was I had an opportunity for work I
[57:57] didn't have any family members who hold
[57:59] me back or held me back I didn't have
[58:02] children you know I didn't have these
[58:04] kind of issues so I was free to move
[58:07] that's why I did it um right now we are
[58:11] considering also another move we don't
[58:14] know yet how and where but you know it's
[58:19] a very subjective topic it's very hard
[58:22] to answer to an individual so for
[58:25] example some people want to go to a
[58:27] place where it's very low tax right so
[58:30] they say you know Dubai is zero tax I'm
[58:32] going to go to Dubai okay so who lives
[58:36] in Dubai do you have anyone in Dubai no
[58:38] okay so you're going to be all by
[58:40] yourself not paying taxes do you want
[58:42] that right like do you really want that
[58:45] right so so um taxes is one thing then
[58:49] then the other thing is okay what if I
[58:51] find a place where there is taxes but
[58:54] the taxes are reasonable they're not as
[58:56] high as in for example Sweden or Germany
[59:00] for example Switzerland
[59:02] taxes but not high taxes right nature
[59:07] yes health care if you care about health
[59:09] care you have it um not cheap at all
[59:14] very expensive that's the downside of
[59:16] Switzerland but High income as well so
[59:19] that's also another question are you a
[59:20] wealthy person who already has made it
[59:24] with a lot of Bitcoin or with a lot of
[59:25] money
[59:27] then also the question changes right if
[59:29] you are dependent on income that also
[59:32] changes the equation right so for
[59:34] example let me give you another example
[59:36] if you are still on the income level of
[59:38] your balance sheet right you don't have
[59:40] a lot of wealth but you have you still
[59:43] uh highly depend on your income right
[59:46] then probably Dubai is um sorry then
[59:49] probably a place like Switzerland is a
[59:51] good place right because you can earn a
[59:54] lot in Switzerland
[59:56] pay very low taxes on the income level
[60:00] and it is expensive to live but you
[60:02] can't save in Switzerland there's a lot
[60:05] of things you can do which will not cost
[60:07] you much right you can cook at home for
[60:10] example or you don't have to you know do
[60:13] things that are very expensive but if
[60:15] you for example go to
[60:18] Dubai uh you're going to spend
[60:20] everything you earn in Du buy you know
[60:22] because there's no nature to to to enjoy
[60:25] for free everywhere you go you're going
[60:27] to spend hundreds of
[60:31] durhams you know which is a lot of money
[60:34] there you know so it's a very subjective
[60:36] thing for me personally to be honest I
[60:39] love the Sun so that's the main reason I
[60:41] want to leave uh like my wife and I we
[60:44] both want to go somewhere where it's a
[60:46] little bit more warm and um we're
[60:50] considering it we're not even sure if
[60:53] you know it's just a consideration for
[60:54] the next few years but
[60:56] yeah so uh it's a difficult topic very
[61:00] very difficult to answer depends on so
[61:03] many variables depends on your wealth
[61:05] level depends on your income depends
[61:08] even also on the language do you want to
[61:09] learn a new language for example Dubai
[61:12] why I loved Dubai or in still one part
[61:15] of Dubai which I really love is you
[61:18] don't need to learn another
[61:20] language right everybody speaks English
[61:23] like if you speak Arabic you actually
[61:25] have an issue in Dubai because no
[61:28] service person will a will be able to
[61:30] understand you you know because
[61:31] everybody is speaking English there you
[61:34] know
[61:35] so yeah highly subjective um I would
[61:39] just say whoever is listening just do
[61:41] your own research look at your
[61:43] preferences and decide accordingly
[61:47] amazing yeah it's it's it's an
[61:49] interesting topic I've not dive into it
[61:52] at all like I lived in Germany I lived
[61:54] here now in Austria where in Germany uh
[61:56] Munich actually oh really okay yeah I
[61:59] live in Munich right now uh I lived
[62:01] there a year ago since a year I'm now in
[62:05] in Austria now I'm in Vienna um cool
[62:09] last question before the end routine yes
[62:11] uh it's kind of the end routine already
[62:14] uh I put it to every guest nowadays um
[62:17] what can we learn from
[62:20] you besides Bitcoin what can you learn
[62:23] from me besides Bitcoin because I feel
[62:25] like I have so many uh podcasts with
[62:29] bitcoiners but uh we talk so much about
[62:32] Bitcoin and money and everything and I
[62:35] want to give this small wealth uh in the
[62:38] end of the podcast where we can dive
[62:40] into a different topic uh not not long
[62:46] not like hours but a small window in
[62:48] like what are Bitcoin as are doing
[62:50] outside of Bitcoin and then it's like I
[62:53] last time phrased it like that what are
[62:56] you doing not related to bitcoin and I
[62:57] got like five comments like everything
[62:59] is related to
[63:01] bitcoin which is true which is true
[63:03] which is true um but like but I know
[63:05] what you what you mean what can we learn
[63:06] from you besides Bitcoin
[63:10] so I
[63:12] mean just to say this before I answer
[63:15] the
[63:16] question Bitcoin is related to proof of
[63:20] work which means there is no free lunch
[63:24] right you might be in individual in your
[63:26] 20s you do understand Bitcoin but you're
[63:31] like okay everything sounds great but I
[63:34] have to earn it right how do I earn the
[63:37] Bitcoin that I think I deserve right and
[63:41] to answer your question I think what I
[63:44] have done in my
[63:46] 20s I never
[63:48] prioritized
[63:50] fun and I never
[63:52] prioritized um even
[63:56] girls
[63:59] like my first priority I don't want to
[64:01] say I didn't have any fun but my first
[64:04] priority because I wanted to live a life
[64:06] in my
[64:09] 30s that are easier than my
[64:13] 20s I wanted to have a very tough
[64:18] 20s but less work in my 30s and even
[64:22] less work in my
[64:23] 40s most people choose it the other way
[64:26] because they think I'm only young once
[64:29] so let me just enjoy life I will figure
[64:32] this out later right they don't even
[64:35] think about Bitcoin forget about Bitcoin
[64:37] right they just don't they just don't
[64:40] learn about
[64:42] discipline hard work not necessarily
[64:45] hard but also smart work you know how
[64:49] can I make sure that when I enter my
[64:51] 30s I
[64:54] can I can be more independent be be more
[64:57] free and choose what I want instead of
[65:03] having to follow someone someone's
[65:06] orders right that's the dream of
[65:08] everybody everyone wants that but not a
[65:10] lot of people can do it
[65:13] because they lack the understanding that
[65:18] you need to have a lot of discipline I
[65:19] don't want to say I'm a high disciplined
[65:21] person but I really prioritize these
[65:23] things in my 20s and that's why in my
[65:26] 30s I have an easier life now and this
[65:28] is I think I always try to teach whoever
[65:31] is in his 20s or even below his 20s to
[65:35] really prioritize this you will regret
[65:36] it because as soon as you reach your 30s
[65:40] you wish you had worked harder in your
[65:42] 20s because life will really
[65:45] suck like you will have such a terrible
[65:48] time to find a partner you will have
[65:50] such a difficult time to do things you
[65:53] want to
[65:54] do it's going to be really really really
[65:57] difficult and the formula I found in my
[66:01] life and I suggest everyone who is
[66:03] listening go and read the book The Seven
[66:05] Habits of Highly Effective
[66:08] People that's the book that changed my
[66:10] life so Steven aravi is the author he
[66:14] talks about the four principles of Life
[66:17] One your
[66:20] heart second your
[66:22] mind third your body and
[66:27] fourth your
[66:29] spirit which
[66:31] means um the first one
[66:35] is let's say your body which means eat
[66:38] clean food don't eat trash exercise
[66:42] regularly and so on and so forth take
[66:44] care of the vehicle that God has given
[66:47] you right your your only like this is
[66:51] the asset that's going to make you you
[66:53] know go on for hopefully tens of years
[66:56] right number two your heart have friends
[66:59] and family around you know be with them
[67:02] spend time with them you know take care
[67:05] of your relationships basically third
[67:08] your mind which is read listen to
[67:12] podcasts like Robin's podcast for
[67:14] example listen to good podcasts read
[67:18] books educate yourself keep learning
[67:22] don't stop learning I I I have met a lot
[67:25] of people
[67:26] University Highly Educated guys thought
[67:30] when they got their degree they're done
[67:32] that's when Life Starts dude that's when
[67:35] Life Starts after you get your degree
[67:38] actually the learning starts from there
[67:40] right don't stop learning right that's
[67:42] the mind the
[67:45] spirit have some form of connection with
[67:48] God you want you can call it God you can
[67:50] call it the universe you can call it
[67:52] whatever if it's not religion for you
[67:54] I'm not a Rel ious person some people
[67:56] are if that helps great if it
[67:59] doesn't also fine you know but have
[68:03] something that takes you back to
[68:05] yourself to the
[68:08] present out of your ego know that it's
[68:11] all a game we're playing we're just here
[68:13] for a time we're all going to be gone at
[68:16] some point let's have fun playing this
[68:19] human game we're playing and come back
[68:21] to that
[68:23] realization from time to time and
[68:25] realize that we're
[68:28] not human beings having a spiritual
[68:31] experience we Are Spiritual Beings
[68:34] having a human experience oh wow I love
[68:37] it a
[68:39] lot yes uh that's what I love about that
[68:42] question uh and it's it opens up new uh
[68:47] areas and a whole new like if you tune
[68:49] in right now you think you are in a
[68:52] whole different podcast than like 20
[68:53] minutes ago yes that's true yes it's a
[68:56] whole different thing um our end routine
[68:58] our actual end routine is where the
[69:00] previous guest is asking a question for
[69:02] the next guest without knowing who
[69:03] actually the next guest is okay uh and
[69:05] the question for you uh what is your uh
[69:09] biggest learning that you had because of
[69:16] Bitcoin and we already had like two
[69:18] three things that you could have said
[69:20] when we did not said it before can you
[69:22] read the question again what is the what
[69:24] is your biggest learning yes that you
[69:27] had because of Bitcoin yes not about
[69:29] Bitcoin but because of Bitcoin
[69:36] yes my biggest learning from Bitcoin has
[69:41] been
[69:45] that the definition of
[69:49] freedom I actually never knew what
[69:51] freedom is before Bitcoin never had it
[69:56] never knew I didn't have it never knew
[70:00] that I thought I'm free but I thought I
[70:02] am but I wasn't and with
[70:09] Bitcoin it's the most insane
[70:13] transformation in anyone's mind I mean
[70:16] in my mind it was the most insane it was
[70:19] even bigger than the moment I had some
[70:22] spiritual awakening moments you know
[70:24] when meditating and stuff like
[70:26] that because it it it connected the
[70:29] worlds for me you know
[70:33] and it's the feeling that you finally
[70:37] realize oh my God like this thing sets
[70:43] you free from
[70:45] any from anyone above you that you
[70:49] thought you had to
[70:50] follow including all of your Heroes yeah
[70:53] like all of my heroes died after I
[70:56] learned about Bitcoin all of them I
[70:58] realized
[70:59] actually I don't need
[71:02] anyone like I I can I can actually be
[71:06] like obviously we're inter
[71:08] interconnected uh beings right I know
[71:11] that we are all interconnected all of us
[71:14] are right but from a from a freedom
[71:18] point of view you don't need to ask
[71:22] anybody to be anywhere with Bitcoin
[71:25] right finally I don't have to ask for
[71:28] permission to be in Germany I don't need
[71:31] to ask for permission to leave Germany
[71:34] right if I was an individual who had
[71:36] let's say a couple of thousand dollars
[71:38] or hundreds of thousands of dollars and
[71:40] I would be all invested in real estate I
[71:44] would be trapped like where the heck do
[71:46] you want to go you want to you want to
[71:47] just leave Germany good luck try to get
[71:50] out without paying hundreds of thousands
[71:53] of taxes which which doesn't mean you
[71:55] should avoid taxes all I'm saying is
[71:58] just that the optionality that
[72:00] Bitcoin gives you is one thing that I
[72:03] learned and the other thing
[72:06] is I started to connect with a lot of
[72:12] people that are so diverse from so many
[72:16] different regions for example uh you're
[72:19] you're now you know you're in your 20s
[72:21] I'm in my late
[72:23] 30s because you know about Bitcoin and I
[72:26] know about Bitcoin we meet for the first
[72:29] time in progue and we instantly
[72:35] connect right like how is that without
[72:38] Bitcoin even possible like you have to
[72:40] know the person somehow but because you
[72:42] knew I'm a bitcoiner we instantly
[72:44] connected and you were like come on
[72:47] podcast and I'm like sure you know let's
[72:49] do it let's do it so so I would say
[72:52] freedom and relationships the these are
[72:55] the two things that Bitcoin I would I
[72:57] thought I knew about but taught me again
[73:01] I love it a lot uh and it's it's been
[73:03] such a great pleasure to talk with you
