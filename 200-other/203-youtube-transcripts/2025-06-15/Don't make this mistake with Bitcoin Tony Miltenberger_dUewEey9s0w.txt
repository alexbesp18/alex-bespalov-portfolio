[00:00] I literally thought that when you take
[00:01] your keys off that I could lose them
[00:03] somehow by putting them on this memory
[00:05] stick I was like I'll just leave it on
[00:07] coinbase it seems safe to me but little
[00:10] did I know how easy it is to pull your
[00:12] keys off unfortunately you end up having
[00:14] to pay an attorney how do you feel about
[00:16] it now looks like Bitcoin you know
[00:18] screwed you over Tony everybody should
[00:20] not be doing two Factor they should be
[00:22] using you know a UB key part that pissed
[00:25] me off the most was it wasn't the money
[00:27] it was hey how many Saturdays did I give
[00:29] up to go work and miss my kids gam what
[00:32] I find very interesting have friends and
[00:34] family is they'll form an opinion on
[00:36] something they know nothing about I sat
[00:38] there and I was like how am I going to
[00:39] retire one
[00:41] day what do you think inspires
[00:45] especially real estate people that come
[00:47] from that kind of career to get inspired
[00:50] to get into
[00:52] Bitcoin well you know for myself it was
[00:57] it was uh I'm 47 years old
[01:00] uh I've been doing real estate and
[01:03] Commercial Real Estate just focusing on
[01:05] Industrial for 25
[01:08] years
[01:10] um
[01:11] I work the Seattle market and at the the
[01:16] time that I got into it I'm I'm you know
[01:19] dealing with people that are family uh
[01:24] local investment just local owners that
[01:26] own all of this you know real estate and
[01:28] they're the landlords and they you know
[01:30] lease it out to the local companies and
[01:32] then also National
[01:33] companies and over the span of uh you
[01:38] know you have my first 10 years all all
[01:41] locally owned real estate it felt like
[01:43] there was very few uh institutional
[01:46] ownerships in in Seattle uh specifically
[01:50] industrial and um and then the the last
[01:54] 10 years of my uh career in Seattle it
[01:59] had flip-flopped it all gone over to
[02:01] institutional money and you know you
[02:05] quickly see you know how a local
[02:08] investor local individual values real
[02:11] estate versus an institution and you
[02:14] know local people they all they care
[02:16] about is is the cash flow uh they never
[02:20] push too hard on rents when the leases
[02:24] would come up because they sat there and
[02:25] they said hey this company this group
[02:28] they pay rent on time
[02:30] they take care of my
[02:32] building and I don't get any phone calls
[02:34] on the weekend kind of a thing and uh it
[02:37] was usually a pretty friendly
[02:39] negotiation between the tenant and the
[02:41] landlord and then um but I wouldn't call
[02:44] them a professional landlord okay and
[02:47] then you have this new group that comes
[02:49] in in 200 you know 8 2009 and while
[02:54] you're seeing you know companies close
[02:56] and and uh you know a crisy happen
[02:59] you're see seeing all this new money
[03:01] just flood into the market and it
[03:04] doesn't make any sense because they're
[03:06] paying numbers that we had never seen
[03:08] before and you're like look around man I
[03:11] mean the Market's crashing what is going
[03:13] on here um you know you start seeing
[03:16] these institutions paying for vacant
[03:21] buildings um and that that doesn't make
[03:24] any sense because kind of the golden
[03:25] rule that I grew up with was you know
[03:27] who can pay the most for a vacant
[03:30] building it was always an owner
[03:32] user um because they can make that
[03:34] building work you know work with The
[03:36] Oddities and whatnot of it and they'll
[03:38] pay the most for it but when you start
[03:40] seeing the institutions come into town
[03:43] and and paying uh you know astronomical
[03:46] numbers and every time it just kept
[03:48] jacking up more and more and more and um
[03:53] it was quite amazing because these guys
[03:55] all they care about is the highest price
[03:58] per square foot
[04:00] and so then that you know jacks up the
[04:02] building value well a local investor he
[04:04] sat there and he's like hey I know my
[04:06] value of my building I don't need to
[04:07] keep pushing the rent as hard they just
[04:09] looked at it as a slow and steady Bond
[04:12] and so you know you're seeing your
[04:14] career and your job um you know going in
[04:18] this direction and then as you're
[04:19] learning about Bitcoin in parallel
[04:22] course you you're just going like what
[04:25] is going on here and um it's it it's you
[04:30] see the the effects of the rents you
[04:34] know doubling tripling
[04:36] quadrupling and you know it's it's it's
[04:39] great I guess when you're if you own a
[04:42] building and that's your exit strategy
[04:44] all of a sudden you're sitting there
[04:45] going hey I thought my building was
[04:46] worth $3 million and someone comes in
[04:49] with an unsolicited offer and you know
[04:50] is giving you uh you know 4 million5
[04:53] million you're just like well I'm I
[04:56] never even knew my building was worth
[04:57] this and you saw this time and time
[04:59] again
[05:00] and you know towards the end of my
[05:01] career I sat there and just was like hey
[05:04] don't sell this building you know let's
[05:05] just renew the tenant keep this building
[05:08] in your uh family portfolio because your
[05:11] kids will never be able to duplicate
[05:13] this again I mean these institutions
[05:15] aren't going to be selling these things
[05:17] they just sell to another institution
[05:19] and for you and I to buy a building like
[05:21] this it doesn't make sense as an
[05:23] individual anymore and so that was
[05:26] that's really where you know you're just
[05:29] question and everything and you're you
[05:30] know you're busy at work you got your
[05:31] head down and then you kind of put your
[05:33] head up above the water and you're like
[05:35] what's going on here and um and then you
[05:39] then you just say oh okay this must be
[05:42] just unique to my market and you're like
[05:44] no then you go down every
[05:46] industry and you just see like where
[05:49] money has broken into things and um
[05:53] anyways it just kind of goes right along
[05:55] with your your Bitcoin uh
[05:58] education amazing and uh let's say a
[06:01] little bit on in real estate where do
[06:03] you see the market going with with
[06:05] Bitcoin growing and potentially
[06:08] demonetizing uh the real estate
[06:11] market where where do I see the market
[06:14] like headed right like this second you
[06:16] know I I would have told you in
[06:18] 2014 I I I had two uh partners and we
[06:21] just couldn't believe the where the
[06:23] pricing had gotten to in
[06:26] 2014 and I mean you can only say I mean
[06:29] I've been saying the Market's frothy
[06:31] since then like this is this is crazy
[06:33] we've never seen numbers like this how
[06:35] does it go any higher and then when you
[06:37] talk to other people in the market and
[06:39] say they're not an institution they're
[06:41] just like they just they can't believe
[06:44] the numbers like it can't go any higher
[06:45] let's sell right now uh you know like I
[06:47] don't want to buy it's it's at the
[06:49] highest it's ever been we don't want to
[06:51] buy at the height of the market well
[06:52] that was 10 years ago and so uh it it
[06:57] was you know I just read something to
[06:59] today this morning that you know like um
[07:03] you know finally the Inland Empire down
[07:05] in California one of the largest you
[07:08] know industrial markets in in the United
[07:10] States finally has seen uh the rent
[07:14] growth just kind of level out take a
[07:17] little bit of a dip but not the kind of
[07:20] dip that I would expect you know for
[07:21] just economics looking at it mathematics
[07:24] it's it's still very very very
[07:26] high um and and you know and I you know
[07:30] it works right in with the inflation
[07:32] that we're seeing right now because a
[07:34] lot you know a lot of these you know all
[07:36] these companies they just passed that
[07:37] rent cost back to you and I the
[07:41] consumer
[07:43] so uh I would have expected it to come
[07:46] down quite some time ago um but I I
[07:49] don't think that's the case I keep you
[07:51] know in my mind I I think it will but I
[07:53] I don't know uh because at the same time
[07:56] where where else is I mean while it is
[07:59] you know illiquid asset where else you
[08:02] know for these guys that are in a Fiat B
[08:04] they're sitting there saying where else
[08:06] what's the best store of my value uh or
[08:08] you know for my money and uh real estate
[08:13] is still at you know one of the the key
[08:15] assets where they're sticking their
[08:16] money so I I I think these guys will
[08:20] keep plugging along until you know
[08:22] something breaks yeah definitely and
[08:24] it's also for me interesting when I
[08:26] think of what would I do right now if
[08:28] they would not not been Bitcoin uh
[08:31] before Bitcoin I did a lot of Stock
[08:33] Investing but honestly uh I right now if
[08:37] Bitcoin would be just gone I would
[08:40] definitely do something with real estate
[08:42] real estate has especially in austa I
[08:43] don't know how it is with you amazing
[08:46] tax Benet fits you can do a lot with it
[08:49] um and you can even like if you don't
[08:51] want to be just like in AUST you can
[08:53] diversify and do it in different
[08:55] countries uh every holiday there can be
[08:58] a tax benefit stuff like that so like
[09:01] you can do a lot with real estate and
[09:04] it's a great asset if there's not
[09:07] Bitcoin and there then this then there
[09:09] is like my thinking uh because uh I
[09:13] would be probably one that would put
[09:16] money into real estate and propping up
[09:18] the market uh if there's no Bitcoin
[09:20] right now I'm 100% in Bitcoin and if we
[09:24] are thinking long term like not the next
[09:26] 5 10 years when we think the next 50 100
[09:28] years where Bitcoin is growing stronger
[09:31] and is growing better and better as a
[09:33] store of value and yeah sucking out
[09:36] Financial energy from uh um people
[09:39] that's been in in the real estate market
[09:41] like Gary kadon just posted a picture of
[09:46] his mega mansion and he's like I'm
[09:49] selling it to bitcoin and Bitcoin only
[09:52] like he is directly uh flooding the
[09:54] gates from from Real Estate to to
[09:56] bitcoin and it it is interesting how
[09:58] like this will shape out long term of
[10:00] course when we measure it in US Dollars
[10:02] I think real estate will always go up
[10:04] because US Dollars will crash down but
[10:07] then you have the minds Swift with like
[10:10] let's measure real estate in in Bitcoin
[10:13] and then everything goes down that's
[10:15] what like kind of my aim for for the
[10:17] question like how do you see like really
[10:19] long term does does does does Real
[10:21] Estate come really down to kind of a
[10:24] utility value uh when people stop like
[10:28] saving in it I don't know how is with
[10:29] you but in Austria a lot of people
[10:32] misuse real estate to just like have the
[10:35] life savings in it yeah well that's
[10:39] that's I think they do that you know
[10:41] with the you know with housing out here
[10:44] uh you know they use that as their
[10:45] savings account but that has been you
[10:47] know that's been preached to us since
[10:48] you know since the beginning of time and
[10:51] it's you know I I remember you know
[10:53] someone telling me hey it's a force
[10:54] savings account and it I mean that
[10:56] clicked with me but then again I I that
[11:01] just for that example it was a little um
[11:04] investment and you know just a few years
[11:07] ago I sat there and I thought well hey
[11:09] it feels like we're at the height here
[11:11] I'm you know going to sell it and you
[11:13] you know everybody's like well what else
[11:14] are you going to put it into Tony and
[11:15] I'm like well how about you learn some
[11:18] Bitcoin and you'll see where I'm going
[11:20] to put this you know and that's that's
[11:23] what I've done um and you know as you
[11:25] get more and more orange pill so that's
[11:27] that's very cool to hear that Gary and
[11:29] see that you know on Twitter when he
[11:31] posted that yesterday it a massive house
[11:34] I mean it's very nice house in Florida
[11:35] but uh he'll be able to buy some a lot
[11:38] of Bitcoin with that money yeah and it
[11:41] will be also interesting how it
[11:42] influences a grand Kone like the the
[11:45] just from like an influential point of
[11:47] view granone is the the the one with
[11:50] higher following and stuff like that I
[11:52] don't know like other metrics who owns
[11:55] more and stuff like that but just from
[11:56] his following I think Gran Kone getting
[11:58] into Bitcoin Community would be like the
[12:01] bigger boom effect uh so it will be
[12:03] interesting to to to see what's with
[12:05] grank what's going on with gradone
[12:07] what's also interesting um like how did
[12:11] like your background in real estate
[12:13] influence your thinking of of Bitcoin
[12:15] like how did uh your unique view with
[12:19] with real estate and the background and
[12:21] what you did in the like feeld world uh
[12:24] influence your thinking of how you view
[12:27] Bitcoin well I mean it's you know one
[12:31] you you you sit there and you you sit
[12:33] there I mean like the biggest thing was
[12:37] uh for me was just
[12:40] like when you're advising
[12:43] somebody you know you're just like hey
[12:45] this is a great investment this is you
[12:46] know this is how the mechanics of this
[12:48] work here's how the cash flows work um
[12:51] but then if you need that money you know
[12:53] say in a pinch it is it is very very
[12:57] liquid unless you actually you know dump
[12:59] the
[13:01] price um and so like that in you know
[13:04] that's a that's a that's a big one for
[13:06] me you know the one that I'm still
[13:08] trying to you know uh learn about and
[13:11] and get through my head is just I've
[13:14] grown up in a world where you're you're
[13:17] You're Building these models on
[13:19] investments you know for cash flow and
[13:22] Bitcoin you know doesn't have cash flow
[13:25] and so you know when I you know talk to
[13:28] uh
[13:29] uh you know my old partners and stuff
[13:33] and they're they're they can't wrap
[13:35] their head around that kind of a thing
[13:37] and that's um that'll be but that's what
[13:41] I'm working on you know in my head right
[13:43] now is just like you just I always start
[13:46] and it's like well what's the cash flow
[13:47] and they're saying well there is no cash
[13:48] flow it's but it just you know continues
[13:51] to go up and like you say our purchasing
[13:52] power just continues to go up in it yeah
[13:55] this was also like my problem I had uh
[13:58] three years I needed from 2017 where I
[14:00] heard it first uh I was
[14:03] like 18 or 19 back then uh and then I
[14:07] needed till
[14:08] 2020 uh to get from it's a scam to I
[14:12] invest my first money in that like
[14:14] because I was in the warm Buffet
[14:16] mindsets stock investor all like stock
[14:19] investor as a real estate investor also
[14:20] needs a cash flow a b thing I was like
[14:24] uh I need a cash flow where this going
[14:27] what's the future and like I needed the
[14:30] kick of a friend of mine that ke kept
[14:32] asking me hey what do you think of uh
[14:35] the the Bitcoin thinging because I was
[14:37] quite good with the the stocks and he
[14:38] was like ah what do you think of Bitcoin
[14:40] and then yeah I said it's a scam for
[14:42] three years and at some point the
[14:44] arguments ran ran out and I was like
[14:46] let's dive deep into Bitcoin let's prove
[14:48] my friend wrong and in in trying to
[14:52] prove him wrong I actually discovered
[14:53] Bitcoin bought my first Bitcoin like
[14:56] three days afterwards and stuff like
[14:57] that um and it's always interesting what
[15:00] what people and and families and friends
[15:01] circle and say uh for me it was not that
[15:04] interesting because I was really young
[15:06] so I had not like a lot of history um
[15:08] how did your like family and friend
[15:10] Circle uh um with all the the
[15:14] interesting headlines what's going on
[15:16] with with Bitcoin say when you said like
[15:18] you're focusing more and more on
[15:20] bitcoin well you know I fell into it
[15:23] just you know everybody's got a unique
[15:24] story and you know I I simply wanted to
[15:27] bet on some football games I had three
[15:30] kiddos um that I was staying home with
[15:32] on the weekends with my wife and we had
[15:35] a baby and it was I was like well I want
[15:37] to watch football on Saturday and Sunday
[15:40] and so it's like well I want to learn
[15:42] more about football and not just be a
[15:44] spectator and I was like okay let's try
[15:46] gambling on it and so I had to get the
[15:49] Bitcoin to I mean I just looked at it as
[15:51] a token you know just exchange your
[15:52] money in this token then use that token
[15:54] to bet and I found out real quick after
[15:57] about 3 weeks like I had no business uh
[16:00] gambling with you know I think I had
[16:03] bought a Bitcoin and a half and then i'
[16:07] won a Bitcoin lost a Bitcoin and I was
[16:09] just like I don't have you know uh the
[16:12] dough to be spending 500 750 bucks on
[16:15] gambling on a weekend so I quit that and
[16:19] then you hear about it again and and you
[16:21] said you got into it in
[16:22] 2017 no 2020 unfortunately
[16:25] 2017 were first heard it and then 2020 I
[16:28] got
[16:30] so I then started hearing about it again
[16:33] in 2017 and that's when I was like well
[16:36] what the hell I think I have one of
[16:38] these things and that's that's really
[16:40] when I started you know and so I had
[16:42] bought it for
[16:43] $485 or something like that and then it
[16:47] you know it quickly went up to I I don't
[16:48] know maybe it hit 5,000 bucks and I was
[16:51] like awesome I I'm going to go buy a new
[16:54] stereo I was like I I'm going to go buy
[16:55] a whole bunch of Sonos speakers rip out
[16:59] to Best Buy I went and bought the Sonos
[17:01] speakers I come home and I was you know
[17:05] telling my wife and she's like all right
[17:06] so you sold the Bitcoin and and at that
[17:09] point I thought about it a little bit
[17:10] more I was like well why would I sell it
[17:12] if I'm only into it for 450 bucks or
[17:15] whatever it was so I was like I'll just
[17:17] hold on to it for a little bit more and
[17:19] at that point you know that also drove
[17:21] my education like what the hell is this
[17:23] this isn't just simply a token and so
[17:26] then I I did 2017 I would come home from
[17:29] work and it would be you know one to
[17:32] three hours a day and I didn't listen to
[17:34] podcasts at that time I was just more
[17:36] just listening to
[17:37] YouTube and you know you you're all
[17:40] excited about that and you're like well
[17:42] there's got to be another what's the
[17:44] next token that's going to you know you
[17:46] know crank up and you see number go up
[17:49] and then you know I was trying to
[17:51] remember who it was it was probably like
[17:54] Max and Stacy that just you know just
[17:57] kept harping just get rid of all that
[17:59] other [ __ ] and just focus on bitcoin and
[18:02] I did and um I'm super happy that I did
[18:08] uh and then you just it was it was
[18:11] awesome come home and again spend one to
[18:13] three hours and if it was a good you
[18:15] know episode it' be like all right well
[18:16] let's smash buy 50 bucks let's smash buy
[18:18] a thousand bucks let's you know and then
[18:20] you know and as you in real estate
[18:22] you're all commission so I was like hey
[18:23] I got a good deal here all right let's
[18:25] bu you know let's buy 5,000 10,000 and
[18:28] you just
[18:29] it it was it was a lot of fun my wife
[18:33] uh sat there and and was just like what
[18:37] the hell are you getting into here and I
[18:40] wish I would have had you know instead
[18:42] of uh you know watching it on my phone
[18:44] or iPad I wish I would have had it you
[18:46] know on the TV so she could have
[18:48] listened too and uh been orange pilled
[18:51] at the same
[18:53] time uh but I anyways that's that's
[18:56] that's how I got into it and and um and
[19:00] I still I still need to orange pill her
[19:02] she's she's she's about 90% there but
[19:06] it's
[19:08] uh it's it's still I got Sim swapped in
[19:12] 2021 and so that was a big
[19:15] blow uh to you know that was that was
[19:19] partly my fault partly AT&T partly
[19:21] coinbase right um I'll take a little bit
[19:23] of responsibility for it um but that was
[19:26] a big blow to her she's like well
[19:28] Bitcoin failed and I was like no Bitcoin
[19:30] didn't fail uh one I had you know I had
[19:34] my two
[19:35] factor and it's you know
[19:38] AT&T uh failed me and coinbase failed me
[19:43] but at that point in
[19:44] 20121 that's when I really Dove down the
[19:47] rabbit hole and just you know before
[19:50] that I was scared I thought I literally
[19:52] thought that when you take your keys off
[19:55] that I could lose them somehow by
[19:56] putting them on this memory stick that's
[19:58] where I remember thinking oh there's a
[19:59] memory stick like what if this thing
[20:01] breaks I lose my Bitcoin I was like I'll
[20:04] just leave it on
[20:05] coinbase uh you know they use the same
[20:07] two Factor as Bank of America as like it
[20:10] it seems safe to me but little did I you
[20:13] know know how easy it is to pull your
[20:15] keys off and uh two just how unsafe it
[20:20] is and they you know when I preached it
[20:22] like I knew in my head it's you know not
[20:24] your keys not your Bitcoin it's a you
[20:26] know it's a [ __ ]
[20:27] IOU and um so anyways that's I you know
[20:31] went down I remember reading one of uh I
[20:33] think it was uh Kira bier's books and
[20:37] she has a real great book that just it
[20:39] kind of broke down the technical aspect
[20:41] you know so I could understand it and um
[20:45] I built my you know first note at that
[20:47] time and I just really started um you
[20:52] know becoming a a real maximalist and
[20:56] I'm very proud of it now I mean so yeah
[20:58] I don't wish that I would have lost all
[21:00] that um but at the same time uh it
[21:04] helped with my education and and uh so
[21:07] here I am now but I did get I did you
[21:10] know I did get my value back we sued
[21:12] AT&T and coinbase and we were successful
[21:16] um but you know unfortunately you end up
[21:17] having to you know pay an attorney and
[21:21] you know he he did a great job and so
[21:23] I'm not bitching about that but it is it
[21:26] just I wasn't expecting paying that kind
[21:29] of money to an attorney you know I
[21:30] thought I'd be having that money but
[21:32] anyways it's part of the education for
[21:34] myself but here I am now for the people
[21:38] that don't know what is Sim swapped it's
[21:40] like a hacking attack on your
[21:42] phone yeah so they they go in and it's
[21:46] it's quite coordinated they usually do
[21:48] it over a long weekend a Christmas break
[21:50] or a Thanksgiving break you know here in
[21:52] the states and you know we were having
[21:55] Thanksgiving we had just moved had uh
[21:59] you know all family coming out and
[22:00] everything like that and I go to use my
[22:03] phone and it you know my phone says uh
[22:06] you know no service and I was like ah I
[22:09] don't really need my phone right now
[22:10] anyways I'm I'm preparing for
[22:12] Thanksgiving I'm running around getting
[22:14] oysters and you know just getting the
[22:16] party supplies all that stuff so I was
[22:18] like forget it come home that night and
[22:22] um you know you find out that your
[22:23] Bitcoin is gone you're like what the
[22:25] hell is this like what happened and they
[22:28] end up getting basically the info on
[22:31] your phone to then log uh log into your
[22:35] account and then change all your
[22:38] password so you can't log into any of
[22:40] your you know coinbase accounts and um
[22:44] and then you're totally locked out and
[22:47] then it goes over the break so then AT&T
[22:50] or your phone carriers have different
[22:51] hours and everybody has different hours
[22:54] and um yeah it was awful yeah that's uh
[22:58] and that's why I
[23:00] Al yeah no it's no one ever needs to go
[23:03] through it it's it's a gut-wrenching
[23:05] deal it was hard on my family it was
[23:06] hard on myself you know mentally and you
[23:08] know you want to sit there and you want
[23:10] to tell you you know back to your one
[23:11] question of you know telling your
[23:12] friends and family no Bitcoin is it guys
[23:15] like like jump on and then they sit
[23:17] there and ask me it's like well how do
[23:18] you feel about it now looks like Bitcoin
[23:20] you know screwed you over Tony and I was
[23:23] like no no it it it so it made me really
[23:27] understand Bitcoin and
[23:29] um so and that's where I always thought
[23:30] like you know one coinbase I never got
[23:33] to talk to those guys they're a shitty
[23:35] company they're awful I mean I never the
[23:37] customer service was terrible I had to
[23:39] like I said I had to hire an attorney
[23:41] just to get them to pick up the phone
[23:43] kind of a
[23:45] thing
[23:46] um but it it's uh but yeah no everybody
[23:50] should not be uh doing two Factor they
[23:53] should be using you know uh a u key uh
[23:57] which is awesome or they should be using
[23:59] an authenticator or even better yet you
[24:01] know they should take their next level
[24:03] and take their phone and switch it over
[24:05] to like a cloaked
[24:08] wireless um and then there's another
[24:10] company I I can't remember the name of
[24:12] it but um you know cloaked Wireless just
[24:15] launched um maybe a month ago and it B
[24:20] it it really does eliminate the Sim
[24:22] swapping
[24:23] ability but yeah when they do Sim swap
[24:26] you it's a big coordinated event it's
[24:28] not like just one person's doing it I
[24:30] mean there's a few people involved
[24:32] so uh and the part that pissed me off
[24:35] the most was it wasn't the money it was
[24:38] hey how many Saturdays did I give up to
[24:40] go work and miss my kids games how many
[24:43] like you know nice that I stay late it
[24:45] was like you know it it really was it it
[24:48] did not equate it to money I equated it
[24:50] to you guys stole my energy and I was
[24:53] pissed
[24:55] so sorry go on a little rant
[24:59] but get your keys off secure your stuff
[25:02] and and and um it's no joke yeah
[25:06] definitely and it's like I I always try
[25:10] to hammer this point down take take take
[25:13] yourself C the serious like there's um
[25:16] easy stuff to get into with self-
[25:18] custody there solution I even have a
[25:20] sponsor with with bitbox have a link
[25:23] down in the description uh but there are
[25:25] so many hard worlds there are so many
[25:27] different Solutions you can do you can
[25:29] do it yourself uh even with just like
[25:32] like there's there's really a lot you
[25:34] can do uh with self- custody and there's
[25:38] no reason why you should not do it and
[25:40] there's thousands of reason why you
[25:41] should do it like even if uh um coinbase
[25:45] and your exchange is not going broke and
[25:48] is not gonna rip rip you AP like FDX or
[25:52] something like that right there can be
[25:54] like in your case a hacker uh there can
[25:57] be so many other things like even uh
[26:01] it's like I don't want to get on a rant
[26:03] too much uh but there like self custody
[26:07] um I don't know why I got it really
[26:08] early like in the first week that I got
[26:10] Bitcoin I also bought my first uh back
[26:13] then a ledger and got since then always
[26:16] self custody and never had it on
[26:18] Exchange uh um um but this is something
[26:23] I try to educate everybody on um but
[26:26] let's come a little bit back uh your a
[26:29] little bit back to your family what do
[26:31] you think uh is the biggest miscon
[26:34] misconceptions that people have uh maybe
[26:37] also your wife has but maybe also like
[26:39] other people in in your life that you
[26:41] see just just that it's a scam and and
[26:44] you know at any time I'm going to be rug
[26:46] pulled you know and that's that's really
[26:49] they just they haven't put the time in
[26:51] uh they listen to you know the
[26:53] traditional
[26:54] news um there you know I it's in so did
[26:58] I I mean truly I didn't get a Twitter
[27:00] account until I can't you know maybe it
[27:02] was 2020 or 21 and you know if it wasn't
[27:05] for that I mean that's where you meet
[27:07] this entire
[27:08] community and there is a ton of people
[27:11] out there that'll help and there's also
[27:15] uh you know just people giving away free
[27:17] education every day you know I've had
[27:19] sessions where or not sessions i' I've
[27:21] booked sessions with Bitcoin sessions
[27:24] before um he's helped me you know just
[27:26] answering a bunch of questions you know
[27:28] you go to and they're just reading books
[27:30] I mean but yeah my family they just they
[27:33] still sit there I mean I've kind of been
[27:34] Vindicated a little bit uh with the
[27:37] price action
[27:39] but you just it's it's hard to tell them
[27:42] that this thing solves so many problems
[27:46] that they are bitching about and are
[27:48] concerned about and and it's just um you
[27:52] know you try to tell them you know
[27:54] simply like hey this changes the
[27:56] incentives across the board and it just
[28:00] it doesn't click you you have to put in
[28:02] the work and it sounds you know like I
[28:04] said and it and maybe it's not that
[28:06] interesting to to some of my family
[28:08] members because it hasn't totally
[28:11] affected them yet in their life but I
[28:13] don't see how it's not where everybody I
[28:15] mean you just see where we're at today
[28:18] and then you just you know you go to the
[28:19] grocery store or go get gas whatever I
[28:22] mean I would think that they would be
[28:24] you know I I would think I'd be getting
[28:25] more phone calls
[28:28] uh but I I haven't you know it's just
[28:31] more of them like hey I see your
[28:32] bitcoin's back up and I even talk to you
[28:35] know like old colleagues and they they
[28:38] just oh you know we're into Nidia we're
[28:41] still you know really into Amazon and
[28:43] and you know whatever stocks and and oh
[28:46] bitcoin's still around you know
[28:48] bitcoin's still a thing and you're just
[28:49] I mean that's just you know up two three
[28:51] weeks ago I got that comment and these
[28:53] are from very very smart people that
[28:55] handle you know uh a lot of
[28:59] uh for for other
[29:00] individuals and it it's just it but as
[29:04] this continues to grow I mean those
[29:06] people will finally have to I I will I
[29:09] hope finally just say hey what is this
[29:11] just kind of like I did in 2017 like
[29:14] what the hell do I have here what the
[29:16] hell is Bitcoin and try to figure it out
[29:18] yeah this this magic 10% S curve Point
[29:23] adoption coming where when we have uh
[29:27] Bitcoin being there for a really long
[29:30] time like 15 20 years where we
[29:32] approaching it now like not 15 years but
[29:34] like within this time and then like
[29:37] around 10% of the population adopted it
[29:41] uh more and more like in Every Family
[29:43] there's some Bitcoin in there that can
[29:45] educate if we hit like a certain amount
[29:48] of of adoption and the price is starting
[29:51] to run up this formal that we saw in
[29:54] 2017 a little bit in 2021 can have a a a
[29:59] drastically different shape and a
[30:02] drastically different Force when we hit
[30:04] it now because so many more education
[30:07] pieces out out there like
[30:09] 2017 I always like I was not there but I
[30:13] was there but not as an someone that
[30:16] looks into Bitcoin uh it was not there
[30:19] was no Twitter in in that Dr that is
[30:21] here like right now there was no 20
[30:24] Bitcoin only podcast that tell about
[30:26] that stuff there was more education
[30:29] there than there was like in 2013 2011
[30:33] major respect to people that got into so
[30:35] early and ST stick with it uh but the
[30:39] more educators are out there the more
[30:41] bitcoiners out there the more those uh
[30:45] price run-ups really make a difference
[30:48] because all of the sudden people are
[30:49] like wait I I I this bit thing is still
[30:52] around and and now it's like it wasn't
[30:55] 10,000 then it was 2,000 now it's like
[30:57] 200
[30:58] ,000 what what's going on there and
[31:01] those small effects and those like even
[31:03] you being in your life as one of the
[31:06] Bitcoin guys in the family it's like one
[31:09] Bitcoin point in in the lives of of your
[31:12] circle uh which they will then go back
[31:15] like when it's coming to like 100,000 or
[31:17] 150,000 or like 500,000 they will call
[31:20] you what I find very interesting about I
[31:23] agree with you and what I find very
[31:25] interesting about friends and family is
[31:27] they'll form an opinion on something
[31:29] they know nothing about and I mean you
[31:31] see that on Twitter all the time it's
[31:33] like these people are chiming in and
[31:36] they haven't they just haven't spent any
[31:38] time and they've they've got their
[31:39] opinion and they're just like no you're
[31:41] wrong Tony you this this this this this
[31:43] and you're like God so I I really I've
[31:48] taken a step back I can't I I mean when
[31:50] you know it's just like everybody when
[31:52] they get that aha moment you know you're
[31:54] like one of the guys on the corner with
[31:56] a megaphone just shouting just like hey
[31:58] guess what I found this guys we this is
[32:01] it this is the path let's jump on here
[32:03] I've done the homework don't just here
[32:06] let's go and it's uh it's it's almost
[32:11] like they feel like I'm selling them
[32:13] something and it's like so I'm I'm I had
[32:16] to take a step back and and just I don't
[32:18] really talk about it unless they talk to
[32:20] me about it I told you a lot about 21
[32:22] Bitcoin the best place for me to buy
[32:25] Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin only
[32:27] Exchange
[32:28] but now let's talk about how to secure
[32:30] your Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin you
[32:32] don't want to leave them on Exchange you
[32:35] want to take self custody you want to
[32:37] take responsibility of your own Bitcoin
[32:41] that's why I recommend getting a bitbox
[32:44] bitbox is an amazing wallet where you
[32:46] can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[32:49] simple way very secure you can even
[32:51] create a passphrase with that passphrase
[32:54] you can basically create a hidden wallet
[32:57] on the device itself make sure to buy
[33:01] your bitbox in the link down in the
[33:03] description and with code Robin you even
[33:05] get a 5% discount and this there has
[33:08] this amazing uh movie scene that was
[33:11] turned into a meme now uh where the guy
[33:15] is saying come on to the ark come on to
[33:17] the AR and then there's like rain and
[33:19] people it's just a little rain then the
[33:21] rain stops and everybody laughs at him
[33:23] and then the Dam breaks the water is
[33:26] really coming down and then all of the
[33:28] sudden everybody comes on the arc and I
[33:30] think we at some point will hit this
[33:32] point I don't know if we hit it this
[33:34] year or in five years this can the
[33:37] timing can be difficult but there will
[33:39] be this this inflection point where like
[33:42] the adoption curve uh the price run up
[33:46] uh the everything is coming into like
[33:49] the perfect storm for for Bitcoin and
[33:51] even if it does not come then it's like
[33:53] a slow progression which would be
[33:55] probably better because like I always
[33:56] make this um example of the Titanic
[34:00] syncing you want to have the Titanic
[34:03] sinking slowly that people can get on
[34:05] the live raft with with Bitcoin right
[34:07] because when Bitcoin runs up to 10
[34:09] million this also means the US dollar
[34:11] and the feat system really crashes down
[34:14] in a major way which also has
[34:16] indications that are really bad for
[34:18] society it absolutely and what you know
[34:21] when people do ask me about it I just
[34:23] like you know at some point you're going
[34:24] to have to jump on this network so you
[34:26] might as well be early in be um rewarded
[34:30] if not hey okay get you know you'll
[34:33] still get to use a great network but you
[34:35] will be forced to get on this at some
[34:37] point here and you know it has you know
[34:39] in my mind you're just like think I
[34:42] thought that this would happen a lot
[34:44] sooner just because it makes so much
[34:46] sense to me and to you know everybody
[34:48] else that's in it um but it has been it
[34:52] has been slower um but it is it it makes
[34:55] for a much softer Landing when things
[34:58] are starting to break and that's what I
[35:00] try to tell them is you're going to want
[35:03] to have some of this because when the B
[35:06] when like when the Dam breaks it's going
[35:08] to be a problem and people are just
[35:10] going be scrambling anyways
[35:14] definitely um when you look back in the
[35:17] life before bitco like before 2017 or
[35:21] 202020 when you got Bitcoin uh what did
[35:24] like change about your money mindset I
[35:26] think like sound money can change a lot
[35:29] in your your brain uh if you don't have
[35:32] the mindset before some even had like
[35:33] the austr mindset before but what did
[35:36] something change in your VI it it was it
[35:40] it's you know one I was just like every
[35:42] you know probably like a lot of people
[35:44] you know you start making money but
[35:46] you're not saving money I wasn't
[35:48] spending more money than I was making
[35:50] but I I didn't I I'm sitting there just
[35:53] spending just as much as I make and then
[35:56] you know and even if I wasn't I I I sat
[36:00] there and I was like how am I going to
[36:02] retire one day especially living in
[36:05] Seattle and everything was just you know
[36:08] you have all these questions like how
[36:10] was you know you just boom just question
[36:12] after question how are my kids going to
[36:14] live here what job are my kids going to
[36:16] do to be able to afford to live in this
[36:19] life and you're like okay I'll worry
[36:22] about it tomorrow I'll worry about it
[36:24] tomorrow and well it's today you need to
[36:28] worry about that stuff today and when
[36:29] Bitcoin came you're just like it it's
[36:32] it's one of those things where I think I
[36:34] would understand it and I was like no
[36:36] this is impossible there's nothing out
[36:38] there this good that can help solve a
[36:40] lot of these problems and I was it and I
[36:44] just would there's too many moving parts
[36:45] to it and you know you think you
[36:47] understand it and then I'd lose a
[36:48] portion I was like H I'd question
[36:50] something and but uh it's I've always
[36:54] questioned money I never UND you know
[36:56] you just kind I guess always question
[36:58] credit I didn't quite understand how
[37:00] that worked and um so anyways it's as I
[37:06] found Bitcoin you know you start you're
[37:09] like you do you have a haha moment for
[37:11] all these different little things and uh
[37:15] leads you to where you are
[37:18] now do you have uh this is also
[37:21] interesting for me because I'm quite
[37:22] young um like I came into Bitcoin when
[37:25] basically my life started like like my
[37:28] Bitcoin like four years ago uh I was
[37:31] like 21 so like my life basically just
[37:33] started out um but you're now near 50
[37:37] like you're 47 um do you have like a a
[37:40] live lesson uh that you had before
[37:42] Bitcoin that like now got really
[37:44] reinforced uh with with your involvement
[37:47] in Bitcoin something that you can share
[37:50] well so
[37:52] some let me think about that one let's
[37:56] repeat the question one more time
[37:58] I'm let write this thing down so I
[37:59] really because there is there is there's
[38:01] like it's like there's so many it's like
[38:03] what is like the main one but go ahead
[38:04] give me that question again so I really
[38:06] Hammer this down the question is like do
[38:08] you have a live
[38:09] lesson uh which has been reinforced with
[38:13] your involvement in
[38:15] Bitcoin yes I it when I started you know
[38:20] when I found Bitcoin it just like I said
[38:24] I was never a
[38:25] saver but all of a sudden it just made
[38:29] sense to absolutely start saving and I
[38:31] mean it just it it's one of these things
[38:34] where you
[38:37] you I could you just want to Stack as
[38:39] much as you absolutely possibly can and
[38:42] I've never had that in my life before I
[38:45] always knew you know my dad was always
[38:48] like he was an accountant and he was
[38:49] like you got to save Tony you got to
[38:51] save you got to save and I was like well
[38:53] you got to have fun too Dad and then
[38:56] it's but I never did follow through on
[38:59] any of that and then you know thank God
[39:01] that I found Bitcoin because I have been
[39:03] a saver and I'm proud to be a saver and
[39:05] it feels good it's it's um but I've
[39:08] never I've never done that so uh my life
[39:12] lesson is I was supposed to be saving
[39:14] from you know as a life lesson from my
[39:16] parents and I never did and then with
[39:18] Bitcoin I absolutely started saving so
[39:21] um and it's you know I think that my I
[39:25] know my kids will um I talk with them
[39:29] about Bitcoin quite a bit I like I said
[39:31] I can't talk about bit I've been banned
[39:33] talking about Bitcoin with my wife for a
[39:36] while it's you know I don't really care
[39:39] about the number but she's got a number
[39:41] in her mind where once it hits that then
[39:44] I can then I'm allowed to talk about it
[39:45] in the family again with
[39:47] her that's
[39:50] good I mean I have a podcast which is
[39:53] daily and my girlfriend also uh doesn't
[39:56] get Bitcoin do 100% so she she has her
[40:00] satosi in in her wallet because I gifted
[40:03] them to her right I can say that my
[40:06] girlfriend has Bitcoin but she didn't
[40:07] get it uh till now and uh I think I'm
[40:11] I'm like picking episodes where I'm like
[40:14] this one you you have to listen to like
[40:16] every like three weeks or something like
[40:18] that because I'm where she cannot listen
[40:20] to every episode is like one hour a day
[40:23] uh but like handpicked like that in that
[40:26] episode you should list Listen to
[40:27] Because I like maybe she's resonating
[40:29] with the guest more on on that level uh
[40:33] and that's how I try to do it but it's
[40:35] it's hard like and I don't want to force
[40:37] anything onto her like she she will be
[40:39] on her own learning path yeah I've done
[40:42] the same thing I I remember coming down
[40:44] to Miami in
[40:46] 22 and I went down there one just to
[40:49] validate like am I going crazy are these
[40:51] people for real is this are there you
[40:53] know who who are who is this big group
[40:55] and anyways I I just I was super
[40:58] impressed with the attendees and I
[41:01] couldn't wait to you know come back and
[41:03] tell her about it but you know I picked
[41:05] a couple of uh the talks on stage and
[41:09] that I thought that she would love and
[41:10] it was really you know like hey it's not
[41:13] just numbers uh don't look at it just
[41:16] from the US you know our us standpoint
[41:18] think about if you're over you know in
[41:20] Africa and and uh where you've never
[41:24] been able to establish your culture
[41:26] because of money and I never understood
[41:29] that as a kid I was like how come these
[41:31] people can't help themselves like why is
[41:32] this you know and it's just like
[41:34] well light bulb goes off you know you
[41:37] hear Alex gladstein talk a couple times
[41:39] he has a he moderated a panel with uh
[41:43] three or four guests on there and um you
[41:45] hear about you know coming uh from North
[41:49] Korea you had one gal and then another
[41:51] gal down in um I can't remember her name
[41:53] is Freda or something like that and it
[41:55] was just it was it was mind blowing for
[41:57] me where I just thought I could anybody
[42:01] that listens to this can understand
[42:03] Bitcoin and it's um but yeah no amazing
[42:08] yeah pick some episodes and give the
[42:09] good ones out to your you know friends
[42:11] and family exactly and this uh like you
[42:13] have to and I I've been really uh
[42:17] passive now with my orange billing I
[42:19] basically don't touch the Bitcoin topic
[42:22] if it does not come up naturally and
[42:26] that's like
[42:27] I'm I'm aware that everybody sees me as
[42:29] the Bitcoin guy and if someone is
[42:31] interested they come to me and then I'm
[42:33] learning them all the stuff and it works
[42:36] really fine and I'm seeing now as an
[42:38] increased number a little bit but not as
[42:40] I expected it uh that people come to
[42:44] me and I'm not like the one that brings
[42:48] Bitcoin up at every topic which is
[42:49] really hard because Bitcoin is connected
[42:51] to so many or like all of the topics and
[42:55] when you sit in public transport when
[42:57] you sit with family members when you sit
[42:59] with friends and families and they're
[43:00] talking about inflation when you're
[43:01] talking about the problem that's going
[43:03] on with they talking about politics and
[43:05] and I just want to scream
[43:07] Bitcoin right no you do I mean I mean
[43:10] it's even like you'll be talking over
[43:11] dinner with somebody and they'll talk
[43:12] they'll start talking about like they
[43:14] they heard about seed oils or you know
[43:16] the the food or they'll bring up
[43:18] insurance or medical and you're just
[43:20] like guys and you you you do you're able
[43:23] to kind of come in and spit facts and
[43:25] they're like how do you know all this
[43:27] stuff or you know and I'm
[43:28] not I'm able just to kind of dance
[43:31] around and talk about it but they are
[43:33] kind of blown away but so I do think
[43:34] everybody is out there questioning you
[43:36] know things in their own way but just
[43:39] kind still haven't just grasped
[43:42] it yeah what would you say is like your
[43:45] percentage on a Bitcoin standard like uh
[43:48] I think we we all are like in kind of a
[43:51] trying to get to a Bitcoin standard
[43:53] where we like only live on bitcoin only
[43:54] have Bitcoin spending Bitcoin but it's
[43:57] not as easy at some at some points
[43:59] because yeah we're living also in the
[44:01] Fiat system so we cannot just switch
[44:03] completely to bitcoin uh like what would
[44:06] you say how what what elements of
[44:08] Bitcoin standard you already adopted in
[44:09] your
[44:11] life uh you know when you I don't like
[44:15] exercising okay um and it's just because
[44:19] I I I have a [ __ ] voice in my head that
[44:22] just says Ah you can do it tomorrow and
[44:25] um but it's it does remind you you know
[44:28] you got One Life to Live Here take care
[44:30] of it uh then that breaks down to
[44:33] food uh you can't just stick anything in
[44:37] yeah it tastes good I mean it is it's
[44:39] awesome I love Doritos I I mean I just
[44:41] go down the list of food and it it is
[44:43] you kind of sit there and it makes you
[44:44] think like well this this this is not
[44:46] this is not good this isn't my kids
[44:48] should if you know my kids shouldn't be
[44:50] eating this and you just um you know I
[44:53] remember the moms way back when that
[44:55] would be like we have no sugar in our
[44:57] house we have sugar-free stuff and it'd
[44:59] be like come over to my house you can
[45:01] have whatever you want you know we got
[45:03] full sugar you know at my house but it's
[45:08] it's you know as far as like the you
[45:10] know the Bitcoin standard on you know
[45:13] monetarily I mean it's I would love to
[45:15] be living on it 100% I mean I really
[45:18] would and I think we will at some point
[45:21] here sooner than later and I mean you're
[45:23] starting to see all the different
[45:24] conversations that people are having
[45:26] about you know well I got this Bitcoin
[45:28] how am I going to use it without
[45:29] spending it so we're going to start
[45:31] seeing you know lending and how does
[45:33] that you know prop up you're going to
[45:34] start it's
[45:36] just um you start seeing more and more
[45:39] of that but I'd like to be you know in
[45:42] my mind I'm living 100% Bitcoin standard
[45:46] uh but I know we're not there I mean I I
[45:48] go to I go to bed you know more bullish
[45:50] than I was yesterday I really do and uh
[45:54] wake up in the morning excited and and
[45:58] um just you know I always think like how
[46:01] is this thing going to break like can it
[46:02] break and you just again you can't find
[46:04] anything and you're just like well I'm
[46:06] more bullish today than I was yesterday
[46:09] a definitely and it's it's interesting
[46:12] uh how we get into Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[46:14] more and more it's like that's what how
[46:16] the podcast basically came to be because
[46:18] I didn't want to talk about Bitcoin too
[46:21] much in my friends and family Circle and
[46:22] then I'm like searching an outlet for
[46:24] Twitter then right all of a sudden I'm
[46:26] starting to talk about with
[46:28] bitcoiners I just can't believe that we
[46:31] get to do this um and we get to witness
[46:34] this front row um and we get to watch
[46:37] this change and it's it is going to be
[46:39] you know there's going to be some tough
[46:40] times there's going to be The Good the
[46:42] Bad and the Ugly um but it it will be
[46:45] not something that we uh just read about
[46:49] and these people that read about this 50
[46:51] years from now won't I mean they'll be
[46:53] able to think about it but they they
[46:55] will not have that same perspective Ive
[46:57] that you and I have because we've lived
[46:59] in both
[47:00] worlds
[47:02] and it's it's like back
[47:06] to you know life before cell phone
[47:09] internet there's not going to be people
[47:11] that understand that but it was much
[47:14] different
[47:15] before and um and you've just seen the
[47:18] changes and how how that's come about
[47:21] and and I mean I was I went I was
[47:22] talking with a buddy and he's the one
[47:24] that in
[47:25] 1994 I was down at bit block boom and he
[47:28] met me down there and we were just
[47:29] talking about the old days and we were
[47:31] graduating high school and it was it was
[47:33] 94 and he he was like the first kid to
[47:38] have internet and he's like and I'm like
[47:40] what the hell is the internet like tell
[47:41] me about this and you couldn't explain
[47:43] it you just he everybody's trying to
[47:45] talk about it and couldn't explain it
[47:48] but now that you've done it it seems so
[47:50] simple um and so um that's what I'm
[47:54] excited for is just that we get to to
[47:57] actually experience this and you know
[47:59] have touched both sides you know of the
[48:02] line of the sand there definitely and
[48:04] it's interesting because Bitcoin is
[48:07] actually probably for me in my opinion
[48:10] the biggest Revolution that's going on
[48:12] right now and uh we are right now seeing
[48:16] it evolving like we still so early to
[48:19] see Bitcoin growing from like 2% 1%
[48:23] adoption rate to like 50 70 80 %
[48:27] adoption rate eventually if it's becomes
[48:29] the base layer of our financial and
[48:31] monetary system which is crazy to live
[48:35] through and that's yeah as I said before
[48:37] that's busic the the premise of this
[48:39] podcast I want to just document the
[48:40] whole thing and talk with everyone that
[48:43] calls himself a
[48:45] bitcoiner and I'm gra Journey um well
[48:49] just think about all the things you
[48:51] never questioned before like I never
[48:52] questioned like my checking account I
[48:55] just was like well this is open a
[48:57] account this is just how I don't know
[48:58] how it works I don't care how it works I
[49:00] just want to write send a check off well
[49:03] now it's just I I think people you know
[49:07] on their Journey they question all those
[49:08] kind of things and they'll um anyways
[49:12] yeah they need to start questioning more
[49:14] and
[49:14] more yeah critical thinking is something
[49:17] really important that we need to enhance
[49:19] in our society hopefully it conduct
[49:22] that um I'm always speaking with a lot
[49:26] of Bitcoin as and the thing that I
[49:27] noticed that bitcoiners are extremely
[49:30] learning they're extremely curious about
[49:33] stuff uh they are even Beyond Bitcoin
[49:36] with food and everything going on uh and
[49:39] even like Beyond like all the imagin
[49:42] there just like super curious people
[49:44] that want to question everything and ask
[49:48] everything what's actually doing that
[49:50] they also want to get to bottom of
[49:51] things so it kind of got to my new Andro
[49:55] te where I'm asking before for the
[49:57] actual end routine uh what are you
[49:59] currently studying that's not Bitcoin
[50:01] like what are you passionate about like
[50:04] right now and and studying and learning
[50:06] about uh where is your like time your
[50:09] learning time spent when it's not about
[50:12] Bitcoin or is it just Bitcoin right now
[50:14] it's it it really is you know
[50:18] well you have
[50:20] Bitcoin and then I'd like to find a spot
[50:24] for myself in Bitcoin I mean you can't
[50:26] help but just get you get to a point
[50:28] where you know you go to these
[50:30] conferences um and I went there first
[50:32] just to validate and then next you see
[50:36] like wow I'm in this these people are
[50:39] one the they come from all over the
[50:41] world it's not just the United States
[50:44] and then two you quickly realize you're
[50:46] dealing with some of the smartest people
[50:48] in the world and you can't help but be
[50:51] jacked up to say like well how am I
[50:54] going to fit in this space like I I I
[50:55] want to do something in this
[50:57] space and you you see these companies
[51:02] and meet these you know Founders you I
[51:04] mean and just kind of the
[51:06] whole uh platform of of these people
[51:09] that are that are actually building
[51:11] something so where I sit here and go
[51:12] like oh I'm such a you know Bitcoin bull
[51:15] well they're five years in front of me
[51:17] and they're done talking about it
[51:18] they're going and building something on
[51:20] it and that's the most impressive so me
[51:23] like I sit here and it's like keep
[51:27] studying Bitcoin but I'm also just
[51:28] sitting there like well how does Bitcoin
[51:31] transfer into this like we were talking
[51:33] about real estate well how does that
[51:34] work into you know real estate how does
[51:36] that work into lending how does that
[51:39] work into you know escrow how does that
[51:41] work into just transactions not exchange
[51:44] but transactions and you just kind of go
[51:45] down the line and I I just um you look
[51:48] at all the you know services that I used
[51:51] to do for in real estate and you're was
[51:53] like well okay how do the institutions
[51:56] get into Bitcoin and own real estate and
[51:59] refine and how do they you know the
[52:02] property managers you know start taking
[52:04] you know they start accepting money in
[52:06] Bitcoin um I don't know it's just it's
[52:10] uh I I am
[52:12] I'm the coolest part about it is there's
[52:16] no we're still so
[52:18] early that if you have an
[52:20] entrepreneurial Spirit you're going to
[52:23] just go do it because there's not those
[52:25] you know it's not like well I can get a
[52:26] job here here and here well yes there's
[52:28] the new companies that you can get hired
[52:30] on but it really pushes you towards go
[52:33] create something go do something and
[52:35] that's what's really um like I said I
[52:37] just got back from bit block boom and
[52:39] you just you meet some Fascinating
[52:41] People there and what they're creating
[52:43] and and they are the smartest people in
[52:45] the room and you just like wow um I'm so
[52:49] happy to be a part of this
[52:51] group it's so I don't know a ton of you
[52:53] know there's and you guys you meet some
[52:55] guys that are super tech Technical and
[52:56] GS that are super technical and then you
[52:59] just you know meet some of these people
[53:01] that are more Phil philosophic and you
[53:03] know it's just it's awesome I mean it's
[53:05] it's so I'm trying to find my place in
[53:07] it amazing and uh you're all involved
[53:10] with with investing in Bitcoin companies
[53:13] uh that that I heard what are you doing
[53:16] there that was that's awesome I mean it
[53:18] was it was I
[53:21] just I got to meet um Mike jarmas of
[53:26] lightning ventures in
[53:28] 22 and again I just still was just kind
[53:32] of validating my Bitcoin
[53:34] conviction and you know there you know
[53:37] he's a venture capitalist you know puts
[53:40] these groups together to invest in these
[53:42] companies and you know I was like H I'm
[53:45] just going to focus on bitcoin and then

[54:03] some Mining and I'm just going to go
[54:06] figure this out on my own and I had a
[54:09] chance meeting with Bob Bernett uh from

[54:21] so I did I I emailed him and said hey

[57:19] before your government tries to ban or
[57:22] limits on Rams in a major way
[57:26] oh man well I mean you know I've been
[57:29] following along you know Caitlyn Long's
[57:32] Journey with with Bitcoin and talking
[57:35] about you know choke point
[57:38] 2.0 um and it it it
[57:42] it's I
[57:44] I I don't know I I think they're
[57:47] constantly I I don't know if this is
[57:49] Canna answer your question I think
[57:50] they're constantly I think you have a
[57:51] group that just is smart enough to say
[57:54] [ __ ] why find it you know join it this
[57:56] is this is going to win regardless and
[57:59] then you have these other people that
[58:00] are so on the tit like in Elizabeth
[58:03] Warren and it's just like hey lady you
[58:06] got kids I mean think about your kids
[58:08] your grandkids and their kids you're
[58:11] you're so
[58:12] selfish and it's um so I still can't
[58:15] believe that that's going on um but I
[58:19] think from I mean I think from here out
[58:21] and I think if this baby really ramps up
[58:23] because that's you know that's the first
[58:24] thing they're going to see is is
[58:26] numbers um I think I think could be any
[58:30] day I mean really I mean I think they're
[58:32] sitting there trying to figure out how
[58:34] to keep this big old uh you know Ponzi
[58:37] scheme up I mean I I look at it as I
[58:40] tell my kids it's like a big you know I
[58:42] don't know if you ever played D Jenga
[58:44] where you're stacking blocks and it's
[58:47] just like I can't believe that no one
[58:48] else can see this that we're going to go
[58:50] have all this money out here and we have
[58:52] to turn all these levers just to try to
[58:54] keep that thing from falling over it's
[58:56] like at some point hey this thing's
[58:58] coming down so and they're like you know
[59:02] part of their deal before it falls is
[59:03] they're going to try to take us down to
[59:05] or and um so I don't know but I'd say
[59:09] now they're they're coming after us now
[59:12] I mean they kind of uh started to attack
[59:15] Bitcoin in
[59:16] 2013 uh with with China so like they
[59:20] doing it in a long time and it's yeah I
[59:23] think Game Theory works for us I always
[59:26] wonder about that just like you know
[59:28] where they have all this stuff that they
[59:29] the Bitcoin that they got from the Silk
[59:31] Road like hey are are they trying to
[59:33] throw the cent off by saying hey we got
[59:35] to sell this stuff and they're you know
[59:38] actually in the you know just to try to
[59:40] say hey we're not we don't support it
[59:41] and in the background you know that
[59:43] they're uh purchasing it I I don't know
[59:46] but um
[59:48] anyways yeah it really interesting to
[59:50] see the the game fa playing out um thank
[59:53] you Tony for being on it was a real
[59:55] pleasure to talking with with you uh
[59:56] you're one of the uh great minds in
[59:59] Bitcoin that I did not knew about before
[60:01] the podcast uh and that's why I'm loving
[60:03] it to have so many different Minds in in
[60:06] in Bitcoin on the podcast and seeing
[60:07] them uh how they evolve and do stuff um
[60:11] Before I Let You Go is there anything
[60:13] you want to shout out is there anything
[60:15] uh you want to promote or uh other
[60:17] question how can people get in touch
[60:20] with
[60:21] you uh I'm on I'm on Twitter it's uh
[60:25] Tony milberg
[60:27] one um but I I I was going to you know
[60:32] compliment you I mean like I you know
[60:34] just like I'd said before I mean it's uh
[60:36] you have just a bunch of doers and you
[60:39] could have just thought about doing a
[60:40] podcast but it does take balls to you
[60:42] know to just get up and say hey I'm just
[60:44] G to go do this whatever it is so
[60:47] congrats man I mean I I didn't realize
[60:49] that we were on episode 97 and you know
[60:51] I when I first reached out to you I was
[60:53] like yeah this guy's gonna do hundred of
[60:54] these things that's awesome
[60:56] so you're almost
[60:58] there yes it'll be it'll be a really uh
[61:02] a long ride to 300 this year uh but I'm
[61:06] doing every day now so I could even
[61:08] reach like 320 or something like that uh
[61:11] because uh I'm doing it every day uh and
[61:14] I I think I switched to daily in like
[61:16] January or February and did like five
[61:18] times before that also uh so it will be
[61:21] a really really cool uh time and I hope
[61:24] to get Michael saor on for the
[61:26] 300th uh and after that uh I want to
[61:30] make a big compilation with all the
[61:31] guests like a a small documentary with
[61:34] like I don't know 20 30 minutes wethers
[61:36] like the biggest things but this is
[61:39] future stuff that will probably come out
[61:41] in the beginning next
[61:43] year yeah I think you''ll be able to get
[61:46] Michael sailor on I think you know you
[61:48] do 300 you know 299 episodes there's
[61:51] going to be bound to be some people that
[61:54] are at connections to him to say hey get
[61:58] on this episode so I think you'll be
[62:00] successful there but I was just going to
[62:01] end and just say um what really helped
[62:04] me is you can you know you kind of get
[62:06] in your own little Echo chamber
[62:08] World
[62:10] um make sure to get out meet people that
[62:14] are you know like-minded and you go to
[62:16] these Bitcoin meetups and you know
[62:19] sometime there's you know you meet some
[62:21] you you just meet so many like-minded
[62:22] people there but those the conferences I
[62:25] can't say enough about that because your
[62:27] mind will be blown and mine was and it's
[62:30] it always continuously is just to see uh
[62:34] just the just the Rockstar people that
[62:36] are that are in this space just very
[62:38] very solid human beings I think this is
[62:41] the perfect point where I can mention
[62:43] that uh the Bitcoin PR conference is
[62:45] really soon uh and uh like there's a
[62:48] Code down below with code Robin and you
[62:51] can get a 10% discount uh and I and this
[62:55] is why I also like I try to get
[62:57] strategic with my partners in the
[62:59] podcast uh and Bitcoin Prague was
[63:02] something that just came up uh like a
[63:05] few weeks ago uh because I talked with
[63:09] with Matias the the co-found of it and I
[63:12] was like yeah I want to partner with you
[63:13] because uh last year I was there and it
[63:15] totally changed my life actually like
[63:18] this is Bitcoin pra conference last year
[63:21] with like I don't know seven or 6,000
[63:23] people uh was inspired me to do more in
[63:27] Bitcoin and that's why I'm now not
[63:29] having a day job that's why I'm now not
[63:31] having the fear job and being really
[63:33] solely in Bitcoin and working with
[63:35] amazing Bitcoin companies so of course I
[63:37] want to support that and want to make
[63:39] advertisement for them uh and uh yeah
[63:42] want to meet as many of the podcast
[63:44] listeners and podcast guests and people
[63:46] involved in the podcast in brag uh and I
[63:50] might also come to America that's not
[63:52] sure in July to the National Conference
[63:54] and I'm not 100% % sure but if I go
[63:57] there I I'll definitely uh contact all
[64:00] the Americans
[64:02] there no you you'll be blown away I mean
[64:04] I know there's a lot of people that you
[64:06] know don't like that conference just but
[64:10] at the same time it's that that would be
[64:12] a great one for you to go to and just
[64:14] you know don't mind all the [ __ ] coinery
[64:16] that they might be having there or
[64:18] whatnot but it it's uh it's a great one
[64:20] because you're going to find some some
[64:22] like I said just some solid people and
[64:24] that's amazing and that's it's uh it's a
[64:27] I think an an event where you also have
[64:29] to be there at least once or twice uh
[64:32] and this is also like what I like really
[64:34] about Bitcoin prag there's like zero
[64:37] shitcoin Arena there's like just Bitcoin
[64:39] like there's the high signal I did you
[64:42] were last year there did you plan to go
[64:43] here uh this this this year to the
[64:46] Nashville one uh Nashville and or uh
[64:50] progess uh I'm not I you see I got to
[64:53] get my wife on board with me she
[64:55] wouldn't let me just go to Prague by
[64:57] myself that would be a
[65:00] problem but I am this year uh you know I
[65:03] took my kids down with me and my wife
[65:05] down to Nashville uh I can't remember
