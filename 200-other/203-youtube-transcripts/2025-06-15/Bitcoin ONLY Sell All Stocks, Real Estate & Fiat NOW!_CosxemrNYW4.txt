[00:00] what if they put somebody in there that
[00:01] says oh we need to embrace this we need
[00:03] to take away capital gains we to make it
[00:05] free payment that changes the whole game
[00:07] every large economy like the EU or Japan
[00:09] or all these G7 Nations they all follow
[00:12] in step with the us over time those
[00:14] coins are all going to zero against
[00:15] Bitcoin even in Fiat terms Fiat is
[00:18] completely worthless everything Trends
[00:20] to the cost of production and what is
[00:21] the cost of production to produce a new
[00:23] keyboard stroke to produce new units oh
[00:25] you want a billion you want another 10
[00:27] billion 100 billion click click clack
[00:29] there it is the cost to produce that is
[00:31] zero so Fiat is worthless toilet paper
[00:34] you're stealing their time and their
[00:36] life energy through this system we must
[00:38] resist it is a question of morals and
[00:40] ethics 40% of the S&P 500 are the zombie
[00:44] companies if they didn't have influx of
[00:47] constant debt propping them up and
[00:48] keeping them rolling they would fail the
[00:50] implications of sound money on the job
[00:53] markets are so huge he's made the
[00:56] decision to Long fat which is the worst
[00:58] trade on planet Earth you're long pieces
[01:00] of toilet paper literally like with
[01:03] President dead president's faces on them
[01:05] that's what you're long okay good idea
[01:07] I'm going to go over here and buy the
[01:08] most scarce digital asset ever created
[01:10] on Earth and then you can just keep
[01:12] buying toilet
[01:13] [Music]
[01:17] paper so what do you think about the the
[01:20] whole election what's your
[01:22] read uh I mean it seems to be a very
[01:26] clear mandate for Trump uh so like it
[01:30] for it's closer I mean at least that's
[01:32] what what we what what what we were told
[01:35] right that it will be a close race but
[01:36] it seemed to be not that close uh after
[01:39] all um what this means for Bitcoin if if
[01:43] Trump really follows through and makes
[01:44] it um strategic Reserve asset um makes
[01:49] uh favorable s candidates and V Gary
[01:52] Gensler uh maybe lowers or removes taxes
[01:56] on on on the transaction of course also
[01:58] free draw uh like all those things that
[02:01] he talked about if he follows through
[02:03] with everything that's super for that's
[02:05] great for America I mean it also is
[02:08] great for Bitcoin I think for the price
[02:10] action uh but long term it doesn't
[02:12] really matter but it's definitely good
[02:14] for for the states I think uh so what
[02:17] what's your take on yeah no I agree with
[02:19] everything you just said it's um it like
[02:22] one thing that I've kind of been
[02:23] following is this whole poly Market
[02:25] prediction market movement I think it's
[02:29] uh it's a big change and I think these
[02:31] pollsters have been exposed I mean who
[02:34] is going to believe a poll where it says
[02:36] 5149 I mean when the when the prediction
[02:39] Market is clearly showing like over a
[02:41] 15-point lead you know or even you can
[02:44] even see today when he got elected the
[02:46] price of Bitcoin before the final count
[02:49] Bitcoin surged so Bitcoin was kind of
[02:52] operating as a prediction Market as well
[02:54] as all these other like um you know poly
[02:56] market and the like so yeah I mean who's
[02:59] who's controlling these pollsters you
[03:01] know obviously there's going to be
[03:03] interest to to you know tilt the scales
[03:07] one way or the other if I'm a pollster
[03:09] and you're going to pay me a million
[03:10] dollars to to add a couple points like
[03:13] everybody not everybody not bitcoiners
[03:15] but a lot of people have a number you
[03:17] know and to to issue a poll of a hundred
[03:19] PE and we also don't know how many
[03:21] people are in the poll I've never been
[03:23] ped have you ever been
[03:25] pulled actually not no like it's funny
[03:28] for me to think because like
[03:30] I mean I'm young so I've not voted so
[03:32] much in my life but it's always like oh
[03:34] like how how do they do they do that in
[03:36] Austria actually they are quite accurate
[03:39] like they usually have um predictions
[03:42] and this is actually like with a small
[03:45] margin of of error kind of where where
[03:48] it's ending but it's very different
[03:50] because Austra has like those five
[03:52] different parties so it's not like a
[03:54] winner takes it all and stuff like that
[03:55] so might be easier uh it's also like
[03:58] popular world but yeah I've never been
[04:00] asked that's that's something yeah never
[04:03] never been asked before do you know
[04:04] anybody that has been pulled by a
[04:07] pollster um I don't but I also never
[04:11] asked any B if they have been ped so I
[04:14] don't know maybe there's someone that I
[04:16] know that have been pulled but uh I'm
[04:19] not aware of that yeah no me neither so
[04:21] it begs the question like like who who
[04:24] are these people getting pulled and is
[04:27] it really reflecting what the sentiment
[04:29] at the time is or is it like a
[04:32] controlled group I mean I don't want to
[04:34] get conspiratorial but it's just funny
[04:35] that I've never been pulled I don't know
[04:37] anybody you haven't been pulled and you
[04:38] don't know anybody so it's like maybe
[04:41] they're not capturing the the total
[04:44] population do do to what extent do you
[04:46] think polls can influence the overall um
[04:52] the overall election well I think if uh
[04:55] if you're let's say you have a candidate
[04:57] let's say I wanted to vote for Trump
[04:59] okay and then I go and I see he has this
[05:02] huge 15 Point let's say let's make it
[05:05] like really outrageous he's got like a
[05:07] 25o lead and I'm like busy at my job and
[05:10] I got kids and I got this going on it's
[05:12] like ah well he's gonna win I don't need
[05:14] to turn out right but if it's close then
[05:17] I'm more motivated to be like look I got
[05:19] to take time off work this is really
[05:20] important that I get my vote in right so
[05:22] if you can tilt it one way or the other
[05:24] you can probably change the turnout
[05:28] right negatively or positive I don't I
[05:30] don't know but it's much better to have
[05:34] a pred prediction Market that's accurate
[05:36] where people can make their own judgment
[05:37] based on like reality rather than some
[05:40] phony you know Hillary Clinton was
[05:42] supposed to win the first uh the first
[05:44] election with Trump and that obviously
[05:46] didn't turn out um yeah so I don't know
[05:50] it's a very interesting uh development I
[05:53] know I know Marty bent just recently had
[05:55] a guy that uh like a bitcoiner that
[05:57] developed like a prediction Market on
[05:58] bitcoin with s and stuff so yeah who
[06:01] knows if if if it shows that it's more
[06:04] accurate than pollsters and and
[06:06] bitcoin's reflecting maybe some sort of
[06:09] prediction maybe people use that more
[06:10] than polls in the future who knows it
[06:13] it's interesting because um it's
[06:16] different like uh for example if if you
[06:19] voting uh like you could vote for camela
[06:22] Harris but think that Trump will win so
[06:26] you would poll in like oh like yeah I I
[06:29] I I would vote for C Harris but then you
[06:32] actually go ahead and and and put money
[06:35] on on Trump because you think he has a
[06:36] better chance of winning so uh polls and
[06:40] prediction markets I think are a little
[06:42] bit different even though they should
[06:44] reflect the same outcome right because
[06:47] you're saying it's more of like a
[06:48] betting thing so people are like oh
[06:50] that's good odds like Trump has good
[06:51] odds so I'm gonna put money on this
[06:53] outcome to make money so you're ah okay
[06:55] yeah so it's more like a it's kind of
[06:57] like a hybrid between like betting off
[07:00] and polls so yeah exactly because it's
[07:03] it's also like um you you usually have
[07:07] um like those polls if if I would
[07:10] conduct the poll I would try and I don't
[07:13] know how they conduct It in America I
[07:14] have no clue but I would try to hit all
[07:17] different Geographics and demographics
[07:20] uh of America uh and try to get like a
[07:23] group from every uh every
[07:27] demographic with with a poly mark Market
[07:29] thing you have people that have um I
[07:33] think it's crypto cryptos you can pay
[07:35] like there's no feat thing you can pay
[07:37] poly Market I think I don't know is
[07:39] there is that a crypto thing actually
[07:41] poly I never did something with that
[07:42] I've I've just downloaded the app and
[07:44] then I follow him on on X or on Twitter
[07:46] so I don't really know how it works I've
[07:48] never actually like placed a wager or a
[07:51] or a you know a bet on anything so I'm
[07:54] not sure I have to dig more into it but
[07:56] yeah but I would guess it's probably
[08:00] screwed towards the younger population
[08:03] and a little bit towards the male
[08:06] population uh so that that that that can
[08:09] also screw a little bit with that but in
[08:11] the end it was way more accurate than
[08:13] the post so right yeah that it was more
[08:16] accurate so yeah it says something I
[08:20] think it's going to take a lot of um
[08:22] analysis to see how accurate was and
[08:25] maybe it'll get improved in the future
[08:26] it's just just a very interesting
[08:28] development uh
[08:30] in election Cycles
[08:32] so really interesting yeah but yeah we
[08:34] we're here to talk about Bitcoin yeah
[08:37] it's it's it's really hard to not talk
[08:39] about the election especially like just
[08:41] a few hours after that yeah no it's
[08:43] exciting stuff so I mean sorry to to get
[08:46] sidetracked on on Paulie Market but yeah
[08:49] I mean the development for Bitcoin it's
[08:51] uh it's going to be a big deal I mean
[08:53] what happens when you have um an
[08:56] Administration that's not anti- Bitcoin
[08:59] what happens when you have a pro Bitcoin
[09:01] Administration like like you said
[09:04] they're going to maybe swap out Gary
[09:05] gendler what if they put somebody in
[09:07] there that that says oh we need to
[09:08] embrace this we need to take away
[09:11] capital gains we to make it free payment
[09:13] and like open payment in the US I mean
[09:16] that changes the whole game right and
[09:17] then you know every every large economy
[09:20] like like the EU or Japan or all these
[09:23] G7 Nations they all follow in step with
[09:27] the US you know so if if the US does
[09:30] something everybody else's Game Theory
[09:33] wise they're incentivized to to follow
[09:34] suit
[09:35] so yeah we'll see it's um I'm not going
[09:38] to hold my breath on every single
[09:40] promise from from any politician frankly
[09:43] so I just hope mainly that he does free
[09:46] Ross on day one I think that's one of
[09:49] the most important and then yeah he just
[09:52] has like just decent treatment to
[09:55] bitcoin and it's going to change the
[09:56] game so bitcoin's going to do do what
[09:59] it's do regardless but like you
[10:01] said are you at all concerned that he
[10:04] puts um how should I put it more crypto
[10:08] people than bitcoiners in like there are
[10:10] some [ __ ] coiners all of the sudden uh
[10:12] saying like oh yeah like uh ethereum and
[10:15] all the other coins are also Commodities
[10:17] and like have weird weird weird things
[10:20] around that oh yeah I mean like he he
[10:22] launched that uh World Liberty coin or
[10:25] whatever and you know Donald Trump Jr
[10:28] posts about crypto [ __ ] all the time
[10:30] and yeah I think unfortunately we're
[10:34] going to have that that lumped in with
[10:36] Bitcoin because people like Trump or
[10:39] Donald Trump Jr or whoever on his he has
[10:41] a lot of good bitcoiners on his team I
[10:43] want to differentiate from that but some
[10:45] people still haven't made that
[10:46] differentiation between Bitcoin and
[10:48] crypto and they're lumping in it as one
[10:51] but yeah I mean I think over time those
[10:54] coins are on projects are all going to
[10:56] zero against Bitcoin and even in Fiat
[10:58] terms so
[11:00] yeah I don't see uh that's slowing down
[11:02] Bitcoin any but yeah it's going to be
[11:04] pretty annoying in the next next four
[11:06] years yeah that's the only negative that
[11:09] I could think of like in in terms of
[11:12] Bitcoin and Trump where I'm like yeah he
[11:14] he is his own shitcoin uh maybe he has
[11:19] grades now an opportunity for all the
[11:22] shitcoins to flourish in America but
[11:24] yeah you are right even if he really
[11:26] incentivized them um they will not
[11:29] survive long term against Bitcoin and
[11:32] this probably actually leads to more
[11:35] adoption of Bitcoin long term because
[11:39] those people that are in crypto
[11:41] eventually see Bitcoin and eventually
[11:43] see the Bitcoin education uh things so I
[11:47] think um it's like a crypto is sometimes
[11:52] even like an entry truck to to to
[11:54] bitcoin I I hear that sometimes where
[11:57] people actually come because of some
[12:00] mcoin uh or even like a shitcoin game in
[12:04] into bit into crypto and then they start
[12:07] to educate themselves and then they're
[12:08] like getting old and then they're like
[12:10] getting more experiened and we're like
[12:12] hey I should I should also know what
[12:14] this Bitcoin thing is that everyone is
[12:16] talking about that is the biggest one
[12:18] and I I should probably know about that
[12:20] one so could could be really good also
[12:21] for Bitcoin true yeah I mean I thought
[12:24] it was a really dumb move for his team
[12:26] to come up with this world Liberty coin
[12:28] like right before the election it's it's
[12:31] crazy because like he came to the
[12:32] Bitcoin conference and just said I'm
[12:34] going to fire Gary gendler okay and then
[12:36] right after launches a shitcoin project
[12:39] it's like okay you just open yourself up
[12:41] for like a charge you know for like
[12:44] unregistered launching an unregistered
[12:46] security like Gary gendler could just
[12:48] like okay here's an indictment or
[12:50] whatever like so dumb like the risk
[12:53] reward was just ridiculous like and then
[12:55] then they would have started with
[12:56] Trump's a criminal and look he's going
[12:58] back to court and I mean I don't
[13:01] understand why Gary gendler didn't it's
[13:03] very frustrating for me that all these
[13:05] these uh [ __ ] coins don't get don't get
[13:08] prosecuted I don't understand why they
[13:10] don't but it was especially obvious when
[13:12] Trump does it and then the guy that's
[13:14] supposed to be charging him gets
[13:16] insulted and it's like I'm gonna he's
[13:18] gonna basically get fired and then he
[13:20] still didn't press charges so it's like
[13:22] is the crypto stuff going to stop
[13:23] anytime soon I would love for it to but
[13:26] just doesn't seem like there's any
[13:28] anybody
[13:30] any uh demand for for slowing it down
[13:35] unfortunately it's it's it's for me ex
[13:38] interesting when we look at that because
[13:40] it seems like the same conversation with
[13:42] with fear in general like when I ask
[13:44] people oh like when are we getting rid
[13:46] of of fear and when when are we getting
[13:47] rid of altcoins uh usually the answer is
[13:50] is quite similar like the you could even
[13:54] like exchange the ansers sometimes where
[13:56] like yeah like uh the the we we know
[14:00] it's garbage but we also know that
[14:03] people will stick to that garbage for a
[14:05] little longer and yeah Fe has a massive
[14:09] Network effect addition to that which
[14:12] alins don't have a network effect at all
[14:15] I think not significant at least maybe
[14:18] ethereum a little bit uh but yeah they
[14:21] they sometimes the same answer to that
[14:23] question fat and Krypton I I actually
[14:26] put it in the same category um because
[14:28] it's like a essentially uh issued token
[14:31] in the end of the day and that's what
[14:33] crypto is and that's what Fiat is yeah
[14:37] yeah Fiat is a shitcoin and I mean this
[14:39] is my this is my handle name like Fiat
[14:41] is worthless Fiat is completely
[14:43] worthless ultimately everything Trends
[14:46] to the cost of production and what is
[14:48] the cost of production to produce a new
[14:50] keyboard keyboard stroke to produce new
[14:53] units oh you want a billion you want
[14:55] another 10 billion 100 billion click
[14:57] click clack there it is so ultimately
[15:00] the cost to produce that is zero so Fiat
[15:03] is worthless toilet paper and that was
[15:06] like a big uh a big orange pill moment
[15:09] for me when I realized that it's just
[15:10] like oh okay so I'm getting paid in
[15:12] something somebody else can
[15:14] print like that's blew my mind that's a
[15:17] huge one yeah blew my mind and uh I
[15:20] haven't looked back since so as soon as
[15:22] I get that Fiat hit my account from my
[15:24] job it just gets turned into Bitcoin so
[15:27] yeah you can pay me in the toilet paper
[15:29] but it's going straight into Bitcoin so
[15:31] that's where I choose to save save my uh
[15:34] my time and
[15:35] labor by the way that's a really good
[15:37] orange ping question ask someone um why
[15:41] are you working for something someone
[15:43] else can just print someone else can
[15:46] just issue for themselves and you have
[15:49] to earn that and put your energy in
[15:52] there and someone else is like oh yeah I
[15:55] I just issue more right like that's a
[15:58] great great orange pill or you could
[16:00] even flip it like if I sat at home and I
[16:02] had and I was counterfeiting money is
[16:05] that moral is that ethical well no
[16:09] obviously like nobody can can like
[16:11] counterfeit money because that's unfair
[16:12] because that you could just like you
[16:14] know spend that money and then prices of
[16:16] everything would go up and it would be
[16:17] so unfair it's like well that's what's
[16:19] going on from our Central Bank like
[16:22] that's literally what's going on from
[16:24] our Central Bank our our commercial
[16:27] Banks our central banks and the and the
[16:30] government are all in
[16:32] collusion they all know the game and
[16:35] they're all just printing and counter
[16:37] fitting money and then we're forced to
[16:39] use it so not anymore we have this new
[16:43] thing called
[16:46] Bitcoin I never thought about that it's
[16:48] like when when when the government is
[16:51] doing something uh that would be illegal
[16:54] if a regular citizens does it that's
[16:58] usually not okay
[17:00] like like if if if the government is
[17:03] printing
[17:04] money uh then uh the people should also
[17:09] be able to print money otherwise either
[17:12] printing money
[17:14] like never thought about that
[17:17] perspective the the moment the
[17:19] government is doing something that when
[17:21] a normal citizen does it is illegal the
[17:23] government also should not do that that
[17:25] that's basically the thing I just
[17:27] thought about I and never had that mind
[17:30] switch off like uh I I should do what
[17:34] the government is also uh doing and yeah
[17:38] oh i s sorry for that it's okay
[17:40] mindblowing it is mind-blowing 100% I
[17:43] have the same feeling it's like if you
[17:46] know there's been a lot of heinous
[17:48] things done in the world that were legal
[17:50] it doesn't make make them ethical so if
[17:53] there's something that's happening such
[17:56] as counterfeiting money aren't we
[17:59] obligated to resist that we're obligated
[18:03] as ethical and moral human beings to not
[18:06] accept that system because we we know we
[18:09] now know that it harms others you're
[18:11] stealing their time and their life
[18:14] energy through this system so we must
[18:17] resist is a it is a question of morals
[18:20] and
[18:22] ethics per full star like that's why
[18:25] we're so passionate about Bitcoin
[18:26] because it's you know some can work
[18:29] their whole life and unless they
[18:31] understand that they're supposed to work
[18:33] for dollars or euros and then when they
[18:36] get that they're supposed to convert it
[18:38] and quote unquote invest and put that
[18:40] money at risk in order to just either
[18:43] survive or thrive in the society nobody
[18:46] tells us in public school
[18:49] or on the news that we need to be
[18:52] actually investing our money or else
[18:54] we're getting stolen from right so it's
[18:57] it's it's an Insidious sick system that
[19:00] no that we're all not being educated on
[19:03] and it's unethical so it is is
[19:07] worthless and and on top of being
[19:10] unethical it also produces a lot of
[19:13] inefficiencies like the you just dump
[19:15] money so much on on the uh on the people
[19:19] that everywhere those small
[19:21] inefficiencies and weird business model
[19:23] come up that should not even be there
[19:26] yeah and I mean this is maybe a good
[19:28] segue into like my thread because now
[19:30] you have like all of these companies
[19:31] that are that are basically being
[19:33] propped up with debt right you have
[19:36] companies taking on debt to buy back
[19:37] their own stock to keep their stock
[19:39] price going up and they're getting
[19:41] interest rates at a far lower interest
[19:43] rate than you and I if I go take out a
[19:44] loan a personal loan it's like 9% if
[19:47] they go take out a loan it's like less
[19:49] than
[19:50] 1% okay great so they just like keep
[19:53] rolling over debt on a big huge
[19:55] corporation because they have a
[19:57] relationship with their commercial and
[19:59] Central Bank so yeah there's a lot of
[20:02] companies I've heard the I've heard
[20:03] numbers like 40% of the S&P 500 are kind
[20:07] of zombie companies like if they didn't
[20:10] have like influx of constant debt
[20:13] propping them up and keeping them
[20:14] rolling they would
[20:16] fail I don't know if that number is true
[20:19] that just pops in my mind I can't don't
[20:21] quote me on that but yeah it's pretty
[20:24] sick so inside those zombie companies
[20:27] not only you have the company that's
[20:28] that shouldn't exist you have all these
[20:30] people working a job that's not
[20:32] productive for Society on like on net
[20:36] right so you're kind of like trapping
[20:37] all of these people and these
[20:39] unproductive companies and these
[20:41] unproductive roles what happens when the
[20:44] money printer shuts off those businesses
[20:46] fail and all of those employees go find
[20:48] something they're passionate about
[20:50] something that they're that actually
[20:52] provides value to society I think it
[20:54] changes the
[20:56] world that's that's so beautiful uh and
[21:01] I it's seen more and more where you have
[21:03] a lot of employees that just um organize
[21:08] some Excel
[21:10] sheets they just move things from one
[21:12] thing to another thing and the
[21:14] implications of sound money on the job
[21:18] markets are so huge and I really want to
[21:22] break that down with with with you um
[21:24] maybe quickly before that um monetary
[21:28] premium is something that I want to
[21:30] touch on a little bit before that uh we
[21:32] talked about zombie companies how they
[21:34] have a lot of monetary premium in them
[21:37] we have obviously other assets like all
[21:40] the assets like real estate even gold
[21:41] and something like that that have a lot
[21:43] of um monetary premium in them um
[21:47] because the central banks are just like
[21:51] putting money in the system and then
[21:52] people have to figure out what to do
[21:54] with that money and have to like uh put
[21:57] it everywhere just so to be Diversified
[22:00] and safe um what happens if we now have
[22:03] that one perfect monetary system where
[22:06] for example like me I'm 100% in there I
[22:09] don't hold real estate I don't hold
[22:11] other other assets like that what
[22:13] happens to those things uh do you
[22:16] imagine that actually the whole monetary
[22:18] premium of all the assets uh come to
[22:21] bitcoin or is it more like a hybrid
[22:23] where most of that comes to bitcoin but
[22:25] there will also be monetary premium in
[22:27] in other assets in in in companies in
[22:29] Gold maybe in real estate and stuff like
[22:31] that yeah so I think the way the way
[22:34] that I think about it it's there's two
[22:35] things in an asset like take a house for
[22:38] example you have monetary premium but
[22:40] before that you have utility obviously
[22:42] right so you have a house it's it
[22:44] performs a duty it's a tool it's a place
[22:46] to live it's also money right because
[22:51] then it's it's there's a level of
[22:53] scarcity with real estate that the
[22:56] scarcity of Real Estate is is more
[22:59] scarce than the money because the money
[23:01] is infinite right so that's where the
[23:04] the monetary premium is appearing right
[23:06] so then instead of it being a house and
[23:08] a place to live it turns into a form of
[23:10] money for people right so people are
[23:13] buying houses I know people I'm from
[23:15] Canada it's like probably the biggest
[23:17] housing well maybe not the biggest
[23:19] China's up there but one of the biggest
[23:21] housing bubbles on Earth in my opinion
[23:24] everybody I know back home has oh I have
[23:27] two rental apartments oh I just bought a
[23:29] strip mall like all these people it's
[23:30] like aren't you like a a farmer it's
[23:33] like yeah well I'm in I'm I also own
[23:34] commercial real estate it's like they're
[23:37] not actually taking their capital and
[23:38] and using it for farming or being a
[23:40] pharmacist or a dentist or whatever
[23:43] they're like also also in real estate
[23:45] because they're forced to right so I
[23:49] think what what could happen is that
[23:51] that monetary premium could fall off of
[23:54] real estate but you'll always have a
[23:55] utility value and then that would be
[23:57] priced in Bitcoin
[23:59] right so housing will fall in Bitcoin
[24:03] terms to its cost to production plus its
[24:06] utility
[24:07] value that's GNA that's going to find
[24:10] some sort of medium right a house will
[24:12] be worth something a a beautiful view
[24:14] over the ocean is worth something
[24:15] someone a roof over your head is worth
[24:18] something so yeah I think the monetary
[24:20] premium will fall I'm not investing in
[24:23] real estate you're not investing in real
[24:25] estate I mean if that Trend just
[24:26] continues over and over again
[24:29] do I want a second house maybe a summer
[24:31] house someday maybe do I want a nice
[24:33] piece piece of land with a house by a
[24:35] lake yeah but it doesn't mean it's my
[24:38] investment that's a big differentiator
[24:41] in my
[24:42] mind absolutely if we can buy for a
[24:45] fraction of a Bitcoin a nice summer
[24:47] house maybe yeah no EXA I think I think
[24:50] it's trending to that I mean you look
[24:52] you look at um one of my favorite
[24:54] websites in uh in Bitcoin is priced in
[24:57] Bitcoin 21
[24:59] have you been to this website
[25:00] before Oh yes I actually pull it up uh I
[25:04] I I I actually pull it up a
[25:06] lot on on on the podcast that's why I
[25:09] say oh yes yeah it's so good but but uh
[25:12] it's it's I mean now obviously I I
[25:14] didn't pull it up uh since we hit the
[25:16] all damn High because we are quite High
[25:17] actually right now so it has to be look
[25:20] look really really uh nice right now
[25:24] really really red yeah so good this a c
[25:26] of red so anybody that has hasn't seen
[25:28] this website before maybe I'll just
[25:30] explain it quickly so like what what
[25:31] this is doing is it's pricing I mean
[25:34] Commodities Goods
[25:37] Services I mean from crude oil natural
[25:40] gas gold silver uh different Fiat
[25:44] currencies agricultural Commodities like
[25:46] beef and eggs everything's beef beef is
[25:49] the beef is the first screen one on the
[25:51] screen sorry to under inup okay bad
[25:54] example but uh you okay one out of like
[25:57] a hundred is green but what it's what
[25:59] this chart is saying that when PR
[26:02] pricing eggs in Bitcoin the the price in
[26:06] Bitcoin is falling so it's O year
[26:09] over-ear so it's like on the day on the
[26:11] week on the month on the year what's the
[26:13] percentage change and if it's in red
[26:15] then it's the price is down right so
[26:18] yeah my favorite one is the median house
[26:21] yes exactly you're two steps ahead
[26:24] you're uh you're good at this so um yeah
[26:27] over five years were showing that
[26:29] Bitcoin the price of of a house when
[26:32] priced in Bitcoin is is falling right so
[26:35] it used to cost whatever 150 Bitcoin to
[26:38] buy a house now it costs like 10 Bitcoin
[26:41] or whatever it is so if you priced that
[26:45] same house in Fiat it's like oh the
[26:47] house went from $300,000 to $500,000 it
[26:51] went up it's like when you switch o
[26:53] switch over to the Bitcoin world you
[26:55] start pricing everything in Bitcoin and
[26:57] it's like well why is it falling don't
[27:00] don't houses always go up forever it's
[27:02] like no they don't we get better at
[27:04] building houses we be get more efficient
[27:06] at getting the materials for houses you
[27:09] know we're using
[27:10] technology to build houses better faster
[27:14] stronger and uh and it's it's
[27:17] fascinating to see when you have H five
[27:20] years ago a new house uh is priced at
[27:24] like 44 Bitcoin uh that's like December
[27:27] 1st uh 2019 and now five years later uh
[27:33] it's it's like five Bitcoin right now
[27:35] 5.8 Bitcoin a new average or milon house
[27:39] actually uh that's that's a crazy crazy
[27:42] thing and you have to keep in mind the
[27:45] houses are going up in US Dollars um and
[27:49] people that hold held houses over the
[27:52] last 5 years they probably feel really
[27:55] clever they really feel smart of doing
[27:57] that because their net worth measured in
[28:01] US dollar has gone up significantly but
[28:05] then they don't realize that they don't
[28:08] get more they actually fall like they're
[28:11] looking at a hill that is growing and
[28:14] growing but they don't realize that they
[28:16] actually fall down and that's the only
[28:18] reason why the hill is growing because
[28:20] they fall actually further down
[28:22] perspective yeah wow good point it's
[28:25] it's it's a perspective and then once
[28:27] you switch to hold perspective to to
[28:29] bitcoin it it just it just gives you a
[28:33] lot of lot of
[28:35] um value for your time in in Bitcoin
[28:39] terms already like it it's like that
[28:41] that mind shift uh switch of like oh I
[28:43] should value my time in Bitcoin in
[28:46] satosi and not in US Dollars and not in
[28:50] anything else then all of the sudden you
[28:52] value your time more and you make I
[28:54] think also better life decisions but
[28:56] that's another a tangent 100% And like
[28:59] the way I've been kind of thinking
[29:01] lately is when you look at a price
[29:04] really it is a it is a ratio it is a it
[29:08] is a pair like a tra think of it like a
[29:10] trading pair it's like how many cars
[29:13] priced in chair how many chairs buys a
[29:17] car right it's like oh like aund I don't
[29:21] know how many chairs buys a car but
[29:23] maybe a bad example but what it boils
[29:25] down to
[29:26] is is the price going of of cars going
[29:30] up and chairs are going down well chairs
[29:32] are less scarce and easier to make than
[29:36] the car right so the trend because
[29:39] whatever is more scarce it will it will
[29:42] go up in right so if we take Bitcoin for
[29:46] example it's like oh the price is going
[29:48] up it's like okay Bitcoin is is fixed it
[29:51] is a finite amount right it is it is
[29:53] scarce and fixed it's just more scarce
[29:57] than than what it's being priced in
[30:00] right so it's not that bitcoin's going
[30:02] up it's because Fiat is going down game
[30:04] of scarcity so real estate is more
[30:07] scarce than Fiat that's why it goes up
[30:09] all the time I partnered up with coin
[30:12] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:15] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[30:18] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[30:20] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[30:24] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[30:26] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[30:29] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[30:32] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[30:35] vigilante just dropped a completely new

[30:41] watch collections you have the date of
[30:44] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:47] there and of course also the block

[30:53] I love the level of detail they put in
[30:56] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[30:58] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:01] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:03] love those watches so so much if you
[31:07] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:09] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:11] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:14] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[31:17] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:19] personal recommendation for Hardware
[31:21] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[31:24] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[31:26] gift for a friend who has has still the
[31:28] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[31:31] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[31:34] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[31:39] to get your bitbox and the next step is

[32:16] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:19] level up your sovereignty it's it's also
[32:22] interesting for me um because a lot of
[32:25] people don't realize that uh not
[32:28] financial decision is also financial
[32:30] decision uh and I think that that that
[32:33] example G gives a little bit perspective
[32:36] on that because you have to uh care for
[32:40] your financial situation if you want or
[32:43] not uh I had recently a discussion with
[32:46] someone uh on on like um Sunday morning
[32:50] Branch where a bunch of friends were uh
[32:53] collected and there was a new guy and I
[32:54] talked to him and he's like oh no I'm
[32:56] not comfortable um investing my money
[32:59] and I was like don't you have money and
[33:02] he's like yeah I have my money but I'll
[33:04] keep it on my bank account and and I was
[33:06] like to him you realize that that is
[33:09] investing like you keeping your money in
[33:12] Euros on your bank account that's an
[33:15] financial decision that's investing you
[33:17] are betting on that uh in three four
[33:21] five 20 50 years from now that euro is
[33:25] still there but so many people don't
[33:28] realize that even even if they don't do
[33:31] a decision they make a decision even if
[33:34] only if they don't have any money at all
[33:37] uh but that's then a different topic but
[33:39] that's actually where we come to the job
[33:41] threats that you then posted uh but yeah
[33:44] it's uh you cannot make no financial
[33:48] decision if if you know what I mean yeah
[33:49] he's long Fiat he's made the decision a
[33:51] long fat which is the worst trade on
[33:53] planet Earth right Your your long pieces
[33:57] of toilet paper like literally with
[34:01] President dead president's faces on them
[34:04] that's what you're long okay good idea
[34:07] I'm gonna go over here and buy the most
[34:08] scarce digital asset ever created on
[34:10] Earth I'll just like stay here and then
[34:13] you can just keep buying toilet paper
[34:15] same same thing I love it a
[34:19] joke um one thing that you mentioned
[34:23] that I just see as a pattern uh and
[34:25] maybe it fits also in the in the topic
[34:27] with with America um you uh said you're
[34:32] right now not in in Canada but you are
[34:34] originally from from Canada um I see it
[34:37] with so many Canadians that they are no
[34:39] longer in Canada and they flee from from
[34:42] Canada um how do you see the the the the
[34:47] nation right now there and and why did
[34:50] you uh go away from there or are you uh
[34:53] are you going back or like how what's
[34:55] your plan yeah well my situ I've uh you
[34:59] know I didn't flee because of for
[35:01] political reasons I do think it's a
[35:03] clown show at the moment but we can get
[35:05] into that um the reason why I left is my
[35:08] my wife is Swedish so I was traveling
[35:11] actually met my my wife in Ria ltia and
[35:14] uh I was like backpacking through there
[35:15] before I even knew about honey badger
[35:18] and Bitcoin and all that stuff I was I
[35:19] just was backpacking through there and I
[35:21] met her uh eight years ago and uh now
[35:24] we're now we're married so um yeah now
[35:27] now we live in Sweden we're based uh
[35:29] based in southern Sweden so um that's
[35:32] the reason why I left um I guess I can
[35:35] just start kind of with my whole my
[35:37] whole story um that happened in I met my
[35:41] wife in
[35:43] 2016 I moved to uh Sweden in December
[35:46] 2019 right before the covid
[35:49] thing uh went down so I was working
[35:53] before that uh for about six years in
[35:57] the Canadian oil sands kind of like
[35:59] construction management mining whatever
[36:03] pipelining kind of kind of roles um I
[36:06] studied like construction engineering
[36:08] Tech as a program so I when I moved to
[36:11] Sweden there's no oil I mean there's no
[36:13] oil fields in Sweden they're pretty
[36:15] pretty much anti oil and gas so I had to
[36:17] you know find a new job and get settled
[36:20] and and that's right very inconveniently
[36:23] right before Co struck so I was
[36:26] unemployed and covid started happening
[36:29] and I'm like job hunting and of course
[36:31] everything just like nobody's hiring in
[36:33] covid I mean right in the beginning of
[36:35] covid like the world's about to end and
[36:36] I'm like looking for a job right so in a
[36:39] field that doesn't really exist in
[36:41] Sweden so big
[36:44] disadvantage um so yeah I mean before
[36:48] when I used to go to like job hunting I
[36:51] would just like oh yeah somebody I know
[36:53] or I'd go like you know print off my
[36:55] resume or my CV and hand it out and I
[36:58] got got worked that way kind of through
[37:00] word of mouth but I don't I didn't know
[37:01] anybody and I'm in a industry that I in
[37:03] a country that I don't know so um what I
[37:07] started to do is I started to do what I
[37:09] always did just okay just start I
[37:11] printed off a bunch of CVS put them in
[37:12] my backpack I was literally walking on
[37:14] the construction sites and saying hey
[37:16] like I'm looking for a job and they're
[37:18] like first of all I'm speaking English
[37:20] and they're like kind of like what are
[37:23] you doing here get away from me and then
[37:24] somebody said after maybe 10 10
[37:27] construction sites they're like just
[37:29] apply online like apply online like
[37:31] everybody's like apply online it's like
[37:33] okay so have to apply online so you know
[37:36] first thing you do is you go on like
[37:38] monster.com or jobs.com or like the
[37:40] company ABC company and like check their
[37:43] job
[37:44] listings you know none of them have the
[37:46] job that I want that are posted they
[37:49] don't have any job listings or I'm like
[37:51] searching through them and then when you
[37:53] go to find a job that you want there's
[37:55] like 400 applicants
[37:58] right so you apply for the job and then
[38:00] you don't hear back from them and they
[38:02] they need a personal letter and all this
[38:04] BS right
[38:06] so I uh I probably applied for I I wish
[38:10] I would have counted but I probably
[38:12] applied for like three or 400 jobs
[38:14] during covid right so I mean I'm
[38:17] desperate I I spent 10 months unemployed
[38:20] like all my like my a lot not all my
[38:22] savings but a lot of my savings was
[38:24] going nowhere I'm just unemployed
[38:27] sitting at home in covid no job no
[38:30] support you know because I just recently
[38:32] moved there so there was no unemployment
[38:34] benefits or anything I'm expected to
[38:36] support myself and my wife is
[38:38] technically expected to support me but
[38:41] um you know I'm going through my
[38:43] savings and uh so anyway I start this
[38:46] journey of of how to find work and I
[38:49] mean I think this is really important in
[38:50] this time uh because uh if you are a
[38:54] person who is a bitcoiner and you want
[38:57] to stack Bitcoin you have to have a
[38:58] positive in income you have to be a net
[39:01] producer you can't be living paycheck to
[39:03] paycheck and stack Bitcoin it doesn't
[39:05] work that way right I mean you know this
[39:08] too right you need to have money left
[39:10] over at the end of the month to
[39:12] stack so um I think this is my this
[39:16] whole process that I went on is
[39:17] hopefully going to help somebody that's
[39:19] kind of the goal of this whole
[39:21] podcast anyway um sorry if I'm rambling
[39:24] but um I started to figure out my way on
[39:28] how to how to to get a job I figured out
[39:32] that when you apply for a job let's say
[39:34] it's like on LinkedIn and it's a project
[39:37] manager job for
[39:39] example when you apply you send your
[39:42] they ask for a personal letter and a CV
[39:45] okay so you fill out oh I'm the greatest
[39:46] person on Earth and this is going to be
[39:47] perfect this is my dream job blah blah
[39:49] blah and then you fill out your your CV
[39:51] and you make like it's like you fill out
[39:53] your CV and you submit it online and
[39:55] then you don't hear back right right
[39:57] it's like okay or oh sorry sorry to
[40:00] sorry to inform you that you know your
[40:01] application has been denied or whatever
[40:04] so that obviously doesn't work then I
[40:07] started looking on YouTube it's like
[40:09] okay why am I not getting any calls back
[40:12] and I found out um through this account
[40:15] on YouTube about the ATS system have you
[40:18] heard about this before uh no I mean I
[40:21] read it in your fret but I have no clue
[40:23] what it is yeah so the ATS system is the
[40:25] applicant tracking system
[40:27] so essentially what it is is it's like a
[40:30] software program that these companies
[40:32] use to filter CVS and personal letters
[40:35] so it'll take your personal letter and
[40:37] your CV and then it'll just it'll
[40:40] compare just the text and the words
[40:44] versus the text the the words in the job
[40:47] posting and like let's say I said
[40:49] project manager 10 times in my CV and
[40:52] then the job posting had is was for a
[40:55] project manager I would be you know a a
[40:58] match for the role it's not about like
[41:01] whether I'm good for the role or my
[41:03] experience is good it's literally just a
[41:05] keyword match and then it goes and
[41:07] compiles like a top 10 or a top five
[41:10] candidates list and then the hiring
[41:12] agent at the company like an HR rep gets
[41:15] gets a a top five and then they just
[41:17] read those top five so if if you're
[41:20] applying for a job and you're like one
[41:21] of 200 people applying for the job
[41:24] you've likely been filtered out before
[41:26] anybody's even read your CV and your
[41:29] personal letter that you wrote right you
[41:30] wrote like this passionate CV uh
[41:33] personal letter and it was just it just
[41:36] got filtered out by some some software
[41:39] so um I found that out and what I the
[41:43] next thing I think is like okay well I
[41:44] need to to to match my CV and my
[41:47] personal letter versus this job posting
[41:49] so I went and I figured out okay if I
[41:51] want to get a project manager job I'm
[41:53] going to put project manager a lot of
[41:56] times in my CV a lot of times and all
[41:58] the different keywords like construction
[42:00] and and supervisor and scheduling and
[42:02] all these keywords that match the job
[42:05] posting I submit I started applying that
[42:07] way still nothing what am I doing wrong
[42:11] so funny story I I I thought to myself
[42:14] okay what I'll do is I'll copy the job
[42:16] posting copy the text paste it into my
[42:19] CV turn it white white font so you can't
[42:23] see it shrink it down to like one font
[42:27] put it in the footer of the CV and then
[42:29] when the ATS system scans it I'll be
[42:32] 100%
[42:33] match so then I started submitting CVS
[42:37] with 100% match right I should be at the
[42:39] top of the list if I have exactly all
[42:41] the keywords in my
[42:43] CV then I found out if you're 100% match
[42:47] it kicks you out too you can't be 100%
[42:49] you have to be like a
[42:51] 90 99% match or else the system sees
[42:55] that you gain the system and spits you
[42:57] up
[42:58] so it's like I'm trying to figure all
[43:00] this out and you know how bitcoiners we
[43:02] go right to the bottom of something like
[43:04] I think bitcoiners are so relentless in
[43:07] our Pursuit for the truth that we just
[43:10] go right to the bottom of this and I was
[43:11] obviously motivated to find work so I
[43:14] said okay this isn't working I'm not
[43:16] getting any
[43:17] traction okay so I started going on
[43:20] LinkedIn because they had somebody had
[43:23] told me oh the whole game's on LinkedIn
[43:24] okay so I like look at the job postings
[43:26] on the job section of LinkedIn and I
[43:28] started applying for those and then it
[43:31] dawned on me I've seen like a few people
[43:33] like in the suggestions like recruiter
[43:36] there's people that are recruiters or
[43:38] Head Hunters I was like okay so I just
[43:41] started saying like construction
[43:43] recruiter project management Head Hunter
[43:47] Staffing wind wind energy Staffing wind
[43:50] energy recruiter and I just did that
[43:52] over and over and over again probably I
[43:54] remember sitting like full days just
[43:55] like pounding the keys is to find okay
[43:58] who are the people that do these
[44:00] recruitment jobs and maybe they can help
[44:02] me and I found out that not only is it
[44:05] people there are full con like full uh
[44:08] recruiting
[44:10] companies that H that hire Consultants
[44:13] to find to fill roles for projects so
[44:17] I'll give you an example like let's say
[44:19] you want to build um a wind farm in
[44:22] Austria for example ABC company says
[44:26] okay we need to have two project
[44:28] managers uh three supervisors three
[44:31] admins four uh foremen technicians blah
[44:35] blah blah and that company doesn't want
[44:38] to go and do all that work by themselves
[44:40] so they subcontract that out to do it
[44:43] in-house so they just say Okay a ABC
[44:46] recruitment company fill these roles for
[44:48] us in the best way and and then let us
[44:51] know who the people are going to be on
[44:52] the project right so these recruitment
[44:55] companies develop these uh relationships
[44:57] with large large companies to for the
[45:01] reason of filling the role so those jobs
[45:04] they don't ever see like monster.com
[45:07] they don't ever see LinkedIn jobs page
[45:10] like they already the re recruitment
[45:13] company already has a list and then
[45:15] they're going out and filling the roles
[45:17] like through head hunting with their
[45:18] Consultants so they'll contact people on
[45:20] LinkedIn themselves so if you don't know
[45:23] that this is going on and you're looking
[45:25] for a project management
[45:27] role and you're just like applying
[45:30] online to these these other jobs which I
[45:33] must I must have one little caveat if
[45:36] there is a role on LinkedIn job section
[45:39] for
[45:39] example a lot of times let's say uh ABC
[45:43] company wants to have a project manager
[45:45] needs a project manager and they already
[45:47] have a candidate within their company
[45:49] that they want to fill the role can't
[45:52] just go in in like a lot of times they
[45:53] can't just just hire like a do an inside
[45:56] hire you know if they like if they had
[45:58] laid off a project manager and then they
[46:00] want to replace that guy with John Smith
[46:04] that's already works for the
[46:06] company why did you lay that guy off
[46:09] saying there's like no work for him and
[46:11] then just go and replace him with
[46:13] somebody else like you're kind of
[46:15] putting yourself at risk with The
[46:16] Regulators so what they'll do is they'll
[46:18] take that project management role and
[46:20] they'll post it for a month on
[46:22] monster.com or LinkedIn job section so
[46:25] then they'll say okay we actually didn't
[46:27] do an like want to have an inside hire
[46:30] we posted it in the public but then
[46:33] after a month then the we found the best
[46:37] candidate was actually John Smith from
[46:38] our company so it's a way for them to
[46:41] get around the
[46:43] liability of of doing an inside
[46:47] hire so that job's already filled and
[46:49] dummy like a dummy like me who didn't
[46:51] know the how the system worked I'm
[46:53] applying for that job and that job's
[46:55] already been filled so yeah that's why
[46:58] you also see them online and you don't
[47:00] and a lot of people don't get traction
[47:01] because those those those jobs are gone
[47:04] so once I figured this out I'm like ah
[47:07] okay so then I started like finding
[47:10] okay who is who are the recruiting
[47:12] companies within my industry I added all
[47:14] the companies on LinkedIn who are the
[47:16] people that work at all these companies
[47:18] I connected with all the people from
[47:20] each company and then once I connected
[47:22] with all of them I dm'd them all and
[47:25] made a relationship with them
[47:27] and then I set up phone calls with all
[47:29] of not all of them but whichever ones
[47:31] wanted to like respond back to me I set
[47:33] up phone calls and built a relationship
[47:35] with all of them and sent them my CV so
[47:38] once I started doing this I went from
[47:39] like getting zero traction to I had like
[47:43] three interviews the first week three
[47:44] interviews the second week and then I I
[47:46] don't think I lasted three weeks without
[47:47] getting a
[47:49] job and it was like boom boom boom boom
[47:51] boom it just like people were me like
[47:53] emailing me and messaging me with offers
[47:56] and and job roles that would be perfect
[47:58] for me and like because they're
[47:59] incentivized to find me a role all these
[48:02] consultants get paid by the company when
[48:05] the role is
[48:06] filled right so we talk about incentives
[48:09] a lot in Bitcoin they're all
[48:10] incentivized to find me a job it works
[48:14] right all of a sudden I have a job when
[48:17] nobody is incentivized to give me a job
[48:20] then nobody gives me a job and it's not
[48:22] I'm not making excuses for myself maybe
[48:24] there's roles that I wasn't fit for or
[48:26] whatever
[48:27] just saying in
[48:28] general you I followed the incentives
[48:31] and they
[48:32] worked
[48:33] so sorry I've been rambling but very
[48:36] interesting no that's really really cool
[48:39] um and I
[48:40] think I never really had to search for a
[48:44] job because my first job that I was six
[48:46] years in I found in school and there was
[48:48] like a program and and there I met the
[48:50] CEO so like that was kind of what did
[48:52] you do what did you do outside of
[48:55] Bitcoin uh before Bitcoin I was uh
[48:58] starting there as next to school as a
[49:01] software tester then this was too boring
[49:04] and I said hey I want to program
[49:06] actually so I was a software developer
[49:08] and then actually was like Hey I want to
[49:10] have more uh contact with my clients uh
[49:13] with with the clients of the company and
[49:15] then I got
[49:16] into um manage service then I got into
[49:20] sales uh and then in the end I was
[49:23] having my own clients at the company
[49:25] plus was working very closely with the
[49:28] CEO so I had had a had actually quite
[49:32] nice career in in in that and I was
[49:34] feeling very good also in the company
[49:36] the only reason I left was I want to do
[49:38] something with Bitcoin yeah that's
[49:41] literally the only reason I felt very
[49:43] good there everyone treated me good I
[49:45] had a lot of growth potential I grew
[49:47] also a lot there uh got a lot of
[49:50] knowledge there so it was really cool uh
[49:53] other than it was it security and not
[49:56] Bitcoin and and I just I just like
[49:58] Bitcoin so much more but I know from uh
[50:01] my girlfriend she's coming from India
[50:03] and and she was only two years here when
[50:05] she started uh the the chob hunt or
[50:07] three years here when she started the
[50:09] chob hunt and she didn't new German in
[50:14] Austria and in Austria German is very
[50:16] important for companies oh yeah very
[50:18] traditional you like you have to speak
[50:19] German with us uh and she started that
[50:24] chop hunt um and it was not that easy
[50:28] but she actually found in a reasonable
[50:30] time I think like in four months
[50:33] something like that uh a job actually
[50:35] through Linkedin which surprised me that
[50:38] it actually worked but it was a
[50:40] startup uh and uh it it is a startup I
[50:43] mean now they're kind of crew so it's
[50:45] not that startup anymore uh but and they
[50:49] have English as their main default
[50:52] language because they hire so many from
[50:54] other countries also uh and that was a
[50:56] Perfect Fit uh but I I saw the struggle
[50:59] like you have the recruiting companies
[51:02] uh you have to really uh find
[51:04] connections you have to build
[51:05] connections it's not a oh yeah I I turn
[51:08] I'm not active searching for a job and
[51:10] then all of the sudden jobs turn up and
[51:12] you apply and you get hired like you
[51:14] really have to build the connections and
[51:17] you have to lead up to that uh and and
[51:21] uh in the end of the day uh it's it's
[51:23] it's quality and quantity like you have
[51:25] to uh not like put everything on like
[51:29] one company and like yeah hopefully it
[51:31] goes good uh but you also have to do um
[51:34] the the the quality uh of the
[51:36] application but I have no clue uh like
[51:40] in in a broader sense of application
[51:41] it's just like my experience that I
[51:44] experienced with her uh find finding a
[51:47] job in Austria um but your way seems the
[51:51] the best one you build uh relationships
[51:53] and you use the incentive uh of recruit
[51:57] and also a friend of mine actually does
[51:59] that in Austria he founded a company a
[52:01] year ago and he is a recruiting company
[52:05] because he has a lot of uh motivated
[52:07] people in in his Network and and he had
[52:10] the the connections also to a lot of
[52:11] companies and he he does that now since
[52:13] a year uh so I got a little bit of um
[52:17] little bit of
[52:19] uh insight into that industry so that's
[52:22] why I was also really intrigued when you
[52:24] told me that you want to talk about that
[52:26] on the podcast I was like that's super
[52:28] interesting and then also the the
[52:30] question next to that is like how will
[52:32] that change into
[52:34] Bitcoin uh when we are really
[52:36] incentivized to find the best candidates
[52:39] with a high value proposition like how
[52:42] how will that whole um um chob searching
[52:46] and chob Market change through Bitcoin
[52:50] that's what I'm also really interested
[52:51] what what you have to say about that
[52:53] yeah um it's a great question
[52:57] first I want to like touch on what you
[52:59] said earlier about where you went from
[53:01] um and this is relevant so when you went
[53:04] from your software role and then you
[53:06] just entered Bitcoin how did you
[53:09] evaluate the opportunity cost of staying
[53:12] at your software software job versus
[53:15] just diving into Bitcoin because I'm
[53:17] actually I've started a substack it's
[53:20] one of my new I haven't posted anything
[53:22] yet but I've been writing some articles
[53:23] and one of them is on opportunity cost
[53:25] so that I've been having a struggle
[53:27] myself like I really want to work in
[53:28] Bitcoin I'm just an average pleb I'm
[53:31] obsessed with Bitcoin I'm on a
[53:32] spreadsheet every day like you said like
[53:34] doing something I don't particularly
[53:36] like listening to bitcoin podcast and
[53:38] stuff but I always struggle with the
[53:40] opportunity costs and I'll I'll tell you
[53:42] what what I mean so if whatever if I'm
[53:45] making a 100,000 a year for example
[53:48] right and I'm able to be on that wage
[53:51] $100,000 let's say for example if I'm
[53:54] able to be like cash flow positive at
[53:57] the end of the month and
[53:58] stack then that suits like the the
[54:01] Bitcoin plebs Journey like we're
[54:04] stacking SATs or stacking STS if I
[54:06] wanted to let's say I wanted to become a
[54:08] developer or something maybe that's a
[54:10] bad example but if I wanted to go to
[54:12] university for the next four years and
[54:14] get like a software engineering degree
[54:18] computer science engineer computer
[54:19] science degree let's say it's like
[54:22] $200,000 or
[54:24] $100,000 for years of lost
[54:27] wages and then whether I'm able to get a
[54:30] job that pays a decent wage in order to
[54:34] stack SATs in in four years that's going
[54:38] to come at a hefty price in Bitcoin
[54:40] terms right because right now let's say
[54:43] on a person's earning $100,000 they're
[54:45] able to
[54:46] stack I don't know how much you can
[54:48] stack let's say 5% of that per year in
[54:51] the future even if you get a better job
[54:55] as a software and engineer for like
[54:57] $200,000 you're not going to be able to
[54:59] stack as much Bitcoin in the future
[55:01] because $200,000 is going to be a better
[55:05] wage in Fiat but priced in Bitcoin
[55:07] you're gonna be earning less Bitcoin per
[55:10] year do you know what I mean so it's
[55:12] like I understand if you have enough
[55:14] Bitcoin and it's like a passion thing
[55:16] and you you feel comfortable with the
[55:18] amount that you have but I I don't I
[55:21] feel like I want to Stack more so I'm
[55:23] kind of like in this um golden handcuff
[55:26] scenario how do how do you think about
[55:29] that uh that's super interesting
[55:31] question uh something that I don't talk
[55:33] a lot on the podcast actually
[55:35] um first of all for me I really wanted
[55:40] to start something myself like it was
[55:42] not only working in it security versus
[55:46] working in Bitcoin it was also for me um
[55:50] how I want to work I I really wanted to
[55:52] build something that's mine like I had
[55:54] this dream of like having my own thing I
[55:58] wasn't sure what my thing is but I was
[56:01] always like I want to have my own thing
[56:04] um so that was my dream and I had the
[56:07] stream the first time in
[56:09] 2020 uh and I started in 2020 actually a
[56:13] a stock podcast and the stock YouTube
[56:17] channel uh where I talked about Tesla
[56:19] Apple Facebook so like all those those
[56:21] companies and I also was invested in
[56:24] them uh since like a few years before I
[56:27] started that YouTube channel so I had
[56:29] that massive stream of mine but then uh
[56:32] I also had the job next to it and the
[56:34] job got from a a part-time job next to
[56:37] school and University uh more and more
[56:40] and more and the funny thing that
[56:42] happened is then I forgot about that
[56:45] dream because uh salary was good and
[56:49] they paid me and it was comfortable uh
[56:52] and um there's a saying salary is the
[56:55] truck to give you to forget about your
[56:57] dreams exactly and this was
[57:00] extremely true for me because I actually
[57:03] forgot about it like 2020 uh I was super
[57:06] super motivated to do that and then
[57:09] reality set in um then yeah got a good
[57:13] salary got a good work
[57:15] environment uh that I I didn't had a bad
[57:19] boss I had actually had a very good one
[57:21] uh I had no bad colleagues I actually
[57:24] had very nice and good colleagues which
[57:26] uh I even met outside now I even met
[57:30] them uh a few months after I quit I
[57:32] still meet them uh sometimes so like it
[57:35] actual good relationship also uh and I
[57:39] got a company car and and and things
[57:41] like that so like a lot of benefits uh
[57:44] which is all good um but this the stream
[57:48] didn't completely went away because then
[57:51] in
[57:52] 2023 uh I got into Twitter and I was
[57:55] just like okay I have my job that's my
[57:57] main thing but I also want to have my
[58:00] like my passion project it will be
[58:02] always a hobby project and I just like
[58:04] tweet and connect with bitcoiners
[58:06] because Bitcoin at that time at that
[58:08] time I also switched from stocks to
[58:10] completely all in
[58:11] Bitcoin um and then it went completely
[58:14] all in Bitcoin uh and went into Twitter
[58:17] and I was like okay if I want to do it I
[58:19] want to do it at least with um some
[58:21] commitment so I committed in 2023 in the
[58:24] beginning to do five tweets per day that
[58:26] was my only commitment out uh for
[58:30] Bitcoin in that community and that
[58:32] commitment took me from like 200
[58:34] followers and nobody knows me to 7,000
[58:37] followers to some people have seen my
[58:40] tweets uh that that was basically 2023
[58:43] and I put two to four hours every day in
[58:47] that like every day two to four hours
[58:50] just tweeting I did not see that as work
[58:53] because it was really feeling good I
[58:55] really liked it yeah it's a lot of fun
[58:58] and then I wanted to have also a video
[59:00] format and that then I just like started
[59:02] with with a video format uh making short
[59:05] content making longer content making
[59:07] news content and then uh I remembered
[59:11] about that podcast that really felt
[59:12] meaningful that I started in 2020 and I
[59:14] was like maybe maybe I should start that
[59:16] again uh with Bitcoin now uh and yeah in
[59:20] November 20 the 28th of November
[59:24] 2023 so last year
[59:26] almost now a year ago um I started the
[59:29] podcast with my first episode and that
[59:32] felt really good that felt amazing I I I
[59:36] really loved it and I got to talk with
[59:38] uh I think in in December uh already
[59:41] with Jeff po like just a month later wow
[59:43] and all those um developments were like
[59:47] what like that that feels really good I
[59:50] found something that I actually like but
[59:51] I didn't make any money with that yeah
[59:53] whatever whatever I'm talking to Jeff
[59:55] boo I don't I'll do it for
[59:57] fre exactly and um there's a saying like
[60:02] once you see the grass on the other side
[60:06] of the G like once you see the green
[60:08] grass on your neighbor you really feel
[60:11] bad about your bad grass so uh I I saw
[60:15] the I saw the amazing opportunity that
[60:18] the podcast has and then all of a sudden
[60:22] um I I got uh from Twitter first
[60:26] paycheck actually on Christmas Eve I got
[60:28] the got the message from Twitter that I
[60:31] um apply to have those 5 million
[60:33] impressions of what you need for that
[60:35] and that you will get your first
[60:37] paycheck in like two weeks time
[60:39] something like that uh I got that
[60:41] actually on Christmas Eve and I was like
[60:42] Wow cool uh I didn't know how much it
[60:45] was uh and that was like researching I
[60:47] was like ah probably not that much uh it
[60:50] ended up being like 300 EUR something
[60:53] like that it was definitely not bad uh
[60:56] but it was I was also aware that was
[60:59] that was just the first one and then the
[61:01] next ones are uh lower and it it was
[61:04] like that and it's still like that like
[61:05] I get from Twitter I think 50 or 100 EUR
[61:08] every two weeks so not something I can
[61:12] um support myself on uh but then I was
[61:16] like okay but I get money for random
[61:20] [ __ ] posts on some random platform
[61:26] maybe the meaningful long conversation
[61:29] on YouTube and on podcast platforms is
[61:31] also worth something so I reached out to
[61:33] 21 Bitcoin uh and I was like hey do you
[61:36] want to be my sponsor and they said yes
[61:39] and they set up a contract with me and
[61:41] they said hey let's let's do that thing
[61:44] and now I'm not working with them
[61:46] anymore because I had an English podcast
[61:48] and they only Opera in the German
[61:50] speaking area uh so that long term
[61:52] obviously did not turn out but they gave
[61:54] me the signal um that uh I already had
[61:58] the second income stream because of them
[62:01] and then I was like okay then I have
[62:03] Revenue I have a passion I'm young let's
[62:06] do that [ __ ] yeah yeah let's go and and
[62:09] and I I told you how I like my my job
[62:13] and that was the hardest decision ever
[62:15] like I was pondering about that decision
[62:18] a whole month like four weeks or three
[62:21] weeks straight I was thinking uh in the
[62:24] morning in the afternoon in the night I
[62:26] could not sleep nice I cried multiple
[62:28] times I cried multiple times of like
[62:31] what the heck should I do should I quit
[62:33] my job should I go into uh this new
[62:36] thing that I have no clue if this even
[62:38] turns out like I I have no experience in
[62:40] marketing like right I'm a software
[62:43] developer by trade so like I have no
[62:46] clue what I'm doing here I just I'm good
[62:48] with computers so I was like technically
[62:49] I will can set it up but I have no clue
[62:53] what I was doing so very long answer to
[62:56] your question now now I'm right here at
[63:00] that moment where I'm like um what do I
[63:03] do three weeks completely pondering um I
[63:07] I was talking with my girlfriend I was
[63:08] talking to my dad I was talking to uh um
[63:12] people at the company uh not my boss
[63:14] just like uh employees and tell them
[63:16] told them please don't say anything but
[63:18] I have to have this uh possibility and
[63:22] the interesting part more and more I
[63:24] talk with people I realized I have to do
[63:28] that I I will I will not forgive me give
[63:32] myself the whole life if I'm not doing
[63:35] that if if I do that and
[63:37] fail that's okay that's okay you can you
[63:40] can live with that I tried at least I
[63:41] tried yeah at least I tried and I can go
[63:45] back to do something maybe they don't
[63:47] take me back but I have a track record
[63:49] of six years doing that uh and I think
[63:52] about I was quite good in that I can go
[63:54] somewhere else do the same thing uh so
[63:58] why why not take the chance why why not
[64:00] take the chance uh like and there was
[64:03] one speech of I forgot the name of the
[64:06] the guy who plays the role of um I also
[64:09] forgot the movie now um Under the Dome
[64:13] uh where
[64:15] um oh [ __ ] like what's the movie
[64:18] called where where they where he lives
[64:22] he grows up under
[64:23] The Truman Show yeah yes how is the main
[64:26] character called German I don't know
[64:29] yeah I don't know yeah but definitely he
[64:32] gave a speech and I just saw that in the
[64:33] three weeks and that speech really um
[64:36] stuck with me and he's he told this this
[64:39] story about his conservative father who
[64:42] was I think an accountant or something
[64:44] and he just like was an accountant and
[64:47] he failed as an accountant because his
[64:49] company was closing down or his Branch
[64:52] was closing down or something like he
[64:54] did a great job but his company was just
[64:56] closing down and so he had uh no chance
[64:59] of of of doing that and his his family
[65:02] all of the sudden were um basically in a
[65:05] lot of financial struggles uh and then
[65:08] he said a sentence is like you you can
[65:10] fail in something you don't love so why
[65:15] not take a chance on something you
[65:16] actually like like why why not do the
[65:19] thing that you actually uh want to do so
[65:21] that was basically uh to to answer your
[65:24] question my
[65:26] decision making
[65:28] tree why I did that it was more
[65:30] emotional I have to do that I don't care
[65:33] about the pros and the cons I I was not
[65:35] making lists and and thinking about
[65:37] opportunity costs I was just going
[65:39] emotionally and say like I have to do
[65:41] this now wow that's incredible it takes
[65:44] takes a lot of Courage that's and that's
[65:46] such
[65:46] a it's great I mean your podcast is so
[65:49] good I I was going to ask you too like I
[65:51] don't understand how you do it I mean
[65:53] you you're putting out so many episodes
[65:55] and there's so so well done and um you
[65:57] know the captions on Spotify and the
[65:59] YouTube and like it's incredible how how
[66:03] you get it out but yeah you're fulltime
[66:05] right so you're spending your you're
[66:07] spending all your time on it yeah
[66:09] because you're all in yeah it's uh wow
[66:12] good for you that's so awesome man it's
[66:14] around 60 hours per week yeah yeah yeah
[66:17] I bet it is yeah good for you well yeah
[66:19] maybe do to make that uh story to to
[66:23] give the story happy end uh I recently
[66:26] reach reached um a higher salary I mean
[66:30] it's now a revenue stream not on salary
[66:32] but who cares how how it's called Uh
[66:35] higher salary than I had before at the
[66:37] company and that's just um what is it 10
[66:42] months or eight months after I quit so
[66:44] that that's uh pretty pretty freaking
[66:48] nice wow good for you yeah I think about
[66:50] that too sometimes like I'm doing a job
[66:52] that I hate for however many hour hours
[66:55] a week and I'm doing a good job at it
[66:58] like yeah I mean I just got a actually
[67:00] just got laid off from my job and then I
[67:02] used a recruiter and now I have I'm
[67:04] starting at a new job next week so it's
[67:07] case in point but anyway my point is I
[67:09] got a letter of recommendation so I'm
[67:10] I'm doing a job that I don't like so
[67:13] well that I got a letter of
[67:15] recommendation right so how good would I
[67:17] do if I could just focus on bitcoin
[67:19] every day something I love and I can't
[67:21] stop blabbering about to all my friends
[67:23] and my family and [ __ ] posting online
[67:25] and writing articles and all that stuff
[67:27] yeah if you could if I focus on one
[67:29] thing that I really love then yeah it's
[67:32] uh and I guess I guess for I guess for
[67:35] people that um trying to figure that out
[67:39] uh you have to see like okay what do you
[67:42] want to do and and how do you want to do
[67:45] it like um if you want to work in in
[67:47] Bitcoin uh you can still do this in in
[67:51] in in a normal uh work environment in a
[67:54] normal life
[67:56] uh feat job kind of thing because there
[67:58] are a lot of big companies uh even
[68:01] inside of Bitcoin I mean if you go
[68:03] Bitcoin only company that's a little bit
[68:05] more adventurous and a little bit more
[68:07] start upy but I can definitely recommend
[68:09] that yeah uh but it it it requires a
[68:12] little bit more of an entrepreneural
[68:14] Spirit uh but you can still have like
[68:16] your ninetto five job and and because a
[68:18] lot of people want that a lot of people
[68:20] don't want the headache and and the the
[68:22] stress uh related to being solo or being
[68:25] found or something like that I think
[68:27] most people actually don't want that so
[68:30] uh there there's like this one thing of
[68:32] like okay the side of like do do you
[68:34] actually want to do your own thing and
[68:36] do you actually want to try that and and
[68:38] be an entrepreneur and and start
[68:40] something and and fight for your revenue
[68:42] and and not have an automatic salary
[68:45] every month which changed a lot in my
[68:47] brain like right going from an automatic
[68:50] good salary to uh I have to actually
[68:53] work towards that Revenue every every uh
[68:56] month no days off it's just going in
[68:58] your head all the time right it it
[69:01] changes like it changes how you spend
[69:03] money it literally changes how you spend
[69:06] money because when you don't know for
[69:10] for certain that next month there will
[69:13] come money and like I don't know how it
[69:15] is where in Sweden but probably the same
[69:17] thing in Austria uh even if they lay you
[69:20] off they at least have to pay pay you
[69:22] three months and sometimes like even
[69:24] like half a year they have to pay you
[69:25] the full salary um so there's always
[69:29] this security of like I can spend money
[69:32] now because I at least get three more
[69:34] months even if they lay me off and
[69:36] there's no laying off in in in in the in
[69:39] the vision but if if you have like uh
[69:44] you you you have like I have this like
[69:47] all three four months because I have
[69:48] like short-term contracts with all my
[69:50] partners and I was like okay if I don't
[69:54] get them and there's one month coming up
[69:57] it was in November it was the same thing
[69:58] again they all um um um prolonged their
[70:03] the contracts but uh before that month
[70:05] you go in and like okay if if they all
[70:07] say no to my proposal then I don't have
[70:11] an income
[70:13] anymore if this all breaks down like and
[70:17] that that changes something for you yeah
[70:19] well that that's your whole story is so
[70:21] inspiring and one thing that comes to
[70:24] mind and the way that that I think about
[70:26] you know how you said you didn't really
[70:28] evaluate it too long you just went all
[70:29] in kind of passion Pro and I respect
[70:31] that so much I'm more like in the
[70:33] analytical phase and this I think about
[70:36] this so often have you seen this clip
[70:39] from uh Joe Rogan I don't know who the
[70:41] guest was but he was talking about this
[70:43] concept of most men live in live lives
[70:46] of quiet desperation did you see that oh
[70:50] no but uh I I I I agree with that
[70:53] sentence already yeah so his his thing
[70:56] is like he's like right now we're we're
[70:58] on a podcast and right now me and you
[71:00] are on a podcast and there's someone
[71:02] sitting on a spread sheeet you know
[71:05] tallying up widgets and making a
[71:08] progress report or a schedule or
[71:10] whatever and they don't want to be doing
[71:12] it they wish they were they owned a
[71:14] sailboat or they did something that
[71:16] they're passionate about they're living
[71:18] a life of quiet desperation they're just
[71:20] getting their job done because they have
[71:22] a mortgage and they have a family and
[71:24] they have a car payment insurance they
[71:26] they feel like they can't get out
[71:28] because the money at the end of the
[71:29] month goes and there's no space to leave
[71:32] so they just live their whole life doing
[71:34] a job that they don't like and I feel
[71:36] like when I heard that clip I was
[71:38] listening to that podcast on a spread
[71:41] sheet you know what I mean I was like oh
[71:42] my God that's me and then he says what
[71:45] you need to do is you just need to
[71:48] realize you effed up you got yourself
[71:51] into this situation you made a mistake
[71:54] so I'm like in that phase right now I've
[71:56] realized that I've made a mistake you've
[71:59] made a mistake he said and what you need
[72:01] to do is you need to build yourself a
[72:02] window so you need to spend all your
[72:06] days figuring out how much how you can
[72:08] how you can accumulate enough money to
[72:11] build yourself like a three-month or
[72:13] six-month window where all of your all
[72:16] of your expenses are paid you're going
[72:17] to be okay your family's going to be
[72:19] okay and then you need to spend all your
[72:21] waking hours before or after work making
[72:25] a plan and finding whatever you want to
[72:28] do and pouring yourself into that thing
[72:31] and when that window comes and you have
[72:32] enough money you execute it with
[72:35] everything you have and that's the only
[72:37] way to exit the life of quiet
[72:39] desperation so the way I think about it
[72:42] is right now if I just went out on my
[72:44] own and just tried tried to look for
[72:46] work I don't have an like whatever I
[72:49] want to get to a certain like stacking
[72:52] goal before I go and build my myself
[72:55] that window so I don't know when that's
[72:57] going to be but right now I'm like in
[72:59] the planning phase so I'm going to build
[73:01] myself a window I'm G to find what I
[73:04] want to do whatever creative art form
[73:06] whether it's a podcast or articles or I
[73:09] don't know I'm still don't really know
[73:10] what I want but I'm building myself I'm
[73:13] directing my life towards that window
[73:15] and then when it when the day comes I'm
[73:17] going to go all in just like you I'm so
[73:19] inspired man your your podcast is is
[73:21] awesome and uh yeah you deserve
[73:23] everything that you that you have have
[73:25] it's great good for you thank you so
[73:28] much I appreciate it and then let's uh
[73:31] whenever this window comes then let's
[73:32] get uh get you back on on the podcast
[73:35] and see how how it went afterwards uh
[73:37] would be really I think it it I think
[73:40] those could be the stories uh that are
[73:42] also really inspiring for for people
[73:44] even outside like I committed to this
[73:47] podcast to do it my whole life uh and uh
[73:51] I will fully do that podcast my whole
[73:54] life just like ah like once a week maybe
[73:57] if I'm like okay not not like fully
[74:00] committed to this podcast um and I just
[74:04] want to collect the truth in in the
[74:07] world and right now I think there's
[74:10] nothing else I can focus my time on than
[74:13] Bitcoin so I think the next like three
[74:15] five years the main focus of the podcast
[74:17] will be Bitcoin but at some point
[74:19] Bitcoin will be boring because everyone
[74:21] has Bitcoin everyone understands Bitcoin
[74:23] it will be the this
[74:25] main reserve of the of the world uh and
[74:28] then it's like oh do you have a Bitcoin
[74:30] podcast like why do you keep talking
[74:31] about it that that's boring we have like
[74:34] uh spaceships now flying I don't know
[74:36] what's happening having a podcast about
[74:38] the internet it's like yeah everybody
[74:39] has the internet whatever who cares yeah
[74:41] like like oh let's talk today about the
[74:43] TCP IP
[74:45] protocol yeah exactly there'll be a day
[74:48] but I think that day is a uh a ways away
[74:51] yet so you should be able to get out
[74:52] some some episodes but I uh
[74:55] I've also come across this funny you say
[74:57] that uh about discipline you you are
[75:00] committed to your art form of getting
[75:03] podcast out have you heard of the book
[75:05] um the war of art by Stephen
[75:08] pressfield the war of art The Art of War
[75:11] you mean well there's The Art of War by
[75:13] sunzu right but this is the war of art
[75:16] oh actually I don't know about that yeah
[75:18] so this book I I I keep talking about
[75:20] Joe Rogan but he used to give out in his
[75:22] early episodes he'd give out to all
[75:23] these comedians this book like you had a
[75:26] stack of them and would give them out to
[75:27] all these comedian friends and uh I
[75:29] recently did like got the audio book and
[75:31] I've gone through it a few times and
[75:33] it's got to be one of the best books
[75:35] I've ever read read it's uh it's really
[75:37] changed my perspective so he has like a
[75:41] few different ideas okay so if you are
[75:44] an artist and it doesn't mean like
[75:46] doesn't have to be like drawing or
[75:48] painting can be anything Bitcoin podcast
[75:51] is an art form right a pod making a
[75:53] podcast it's like creating a business
[75:55] creating something the art of creation
[75:59] let's just say it that way in any in the
[76:02] pursuit of creating something there are
[76:05] there are a couple things so one he
[76:07] talks about um what he calls resistance
[76:10] so let's say I want to uh I want to you
[76:14] know write an article a Bitcoin article
[76:16] and publish it on my
[76:18] substack when I I know that every day I
[76:21] should wake up pour a cup of coffee and
[76:23] I should sit down and write right for
[76:25] one hour and then post it on substack
[76:27] that's my goal right I've committed to
[76:29] that resistance is oh no you should just
[76:32] go to the store oh yeah you should just
[76:34] lay on the couch with your wife oh but
[76:36] the dog needs needs to be taken out the
[76:39] dog needs to be played with oh you
[76:41] should do this you should do that he
[76:43] describes the the resistance as like
[76:47] something equivalent to like gravity it
[76:50] is a an always it's like a pressure on
[76:52] your life that is constantly trying to
[76:55] distract you or pull you away from your
[76:57] art and I'm sure you you experienced
[76:59] that all the time as as an entrepreneur
[77:01] like to stay focused as you do which is
[77:03] so amazing that you just like
[77:05] consistently pump it out every week
[77:07] every day it seems like every day you
[77:09] put out a podcast which I want to ask
[77:10] you how you do that because it's
[77:12] incredible but um every day every day
[77:15] yeah I'd like to talk to you even
[77:16] offline how how you even do that but um
[77:19] he's saying okay you need to constantly
[77:21] and consciously fight resistance in your
[77:24] life and in your C
[77:25] so that's number one okay the second is
[77:29] he describes um something as um he he
[77:33] goes into like a lot of like Greek
[77:35] mythology and stuff but he has this this
[77:37] entity that he calls the
[77:40] Muse and the Muse is like a fictional
[77:43] entity and like unseeable like you can't
[77:46] see it what what it's doing is it's it's
[77:50] looking at your life and what it needs
[77:53] is you need to to do the work and like
[77:57] provide an offering to the Muse and you
[78:00] are rewarded with creativity like the
[78:03] Bounty of your art right so if you every
[78:06] day sit down and you start you say 9:00
[78:08] am I'm gonna pour a cup of coffee I'm
[78:10] going to start writing you're gonna
[78:12] write a [ __ ] article and that's that's
[78:14] where I'm at right now I'm just I'm
[78:16] writing just I'm just writing and it's
[78:18] like I don't know what I'm writing I'm
[78:19] not a good writer I'm just writing and
[78:21] then the next day you do the same thing
[78:22] pour a cup of coffee start writing over
[78:25] time after a week after a month after
[78:29] six months after a year you're going to
[78:31] write a damn good article and the idea
[78:33] is is since you are offering that
[78:36] discipline hard work and time to the
[78:38] Muse you are rewarded with with
[78:41] creativity like creativity comes out of
[78:43] The Ether it's like where did uh where
[78:46] did Picasso's painting ideas for
[78:48] paintings come from where did the S the
[78:51] the ceiling of the ctin chapel come from
[78:54] and St step PR pressfield is saying you
[78:57] are rewarded like like the artist is
[79:01] rewarded from the muse from the hard
[79:03] work and dedication that they put into
[79:05] the
[79:06] craft right and I think this is a
[79:09] mindblowing concept because we're we're
[79:12] in a day and age where we have our phone
[79:14] pinging every T every five minutes
[79:16] they're designed to Ping and vibrate and
[79:19] everybody is distracted constantly and
[79:21] then you look around and architecture is
[79:23] like just like a bunch of
[79:25] boxes and you know people aren't even
[79:28] performing like being paid to do art
[79:30] they're not they're not focusing on
[79:32] something creative I'm doing something
[79:36] that's just on a spreadsheet there's
[79:38] zero creativity I was trained to do
[79:41] something non-creative for a Fiat wage I
[79:45] just put through the ringer and now I'm
[79:47] producing be more efficient produce it's
[79:50] like if I direct my energy and I offer I
[79:53] fight resistance and I offer my
[79:56] discipline my intention to the
[79:59] Muse I don't what might come out of me I
[80:02] said to my wife I said if I had a canvas
[80:04] in front of me after 10 years of working
[80:07] on a spreadsheet and teams meetings all
[80:09] those BS what would I
[80:12] paint I I don't even know if I had to
[80:16] write a song what would I
[80:18] write and that was like a really
[80:20] sobering feeling recently like that the
[80:23] creativity has been like drained from my
[80:26] body for what some Corporation to hit
[80:29] their profit margins or whatever to make
[80:32] the stock go up make number go up on
[80:34] their stock it's like yeah I need not
[80:38] only do I need to find something that
[80:40] I'm interested in Bitcoin but for like
[80:42] spiritually as a person we are being
[80:46] drain the Fiat system is draining us of
[80:48] our creativity and that is resistance in
[80:51] itself and we need to fight that
[80:53] resistance so we talked talk about
[80:54] what's going to happen after Bitcoin
[80:56] it's like in the jobs Market it's like
[80:58] well maybe people will have more time to
[81:01] be more creative and maybe architecture
[81:03] will flourish and maybe art will
[81:05] flourish and we can see that through go
[81:08] like gold standard eras where
[81:09] architecture is much better like this is
[81:11] a common Trope on on uh on Twitter right
[81:15] oh look at the architecture from the
[81:16] this uh gold stand standard period it's
[81:19] like yeah because they didn't have to
[81:20] fight like this pressure of resistance
[81:22] of their money losing value they had
[81:24] time to be more creative and focus on a
[81:26] craft for their whole life every day
[81:29] Society just
[81:31] flourishes anyway sorry for my rant but
[81:34] it's uh just really blown my mind
[81:36] recently so wanted to share that that's
[81:38] beautiful yeah that's beautiful I love
[81:40] it it's it's
[81:43] it's it it's so true like it's really
[81:45] hard to stay focused I have to say um
[81:48] because when you work you kind of have
[81:51] to stay focused anyways like you have
[81:52] this work environment there's this
[81:54] office there are those people there are
[81:55] those deadlines there are those uh uh
[81:58] monthly reviews weekly reviews like all
[82:00] those infrastructures and
[82:03] processes uh and boundaries built into
[82:07] that uh if you're an employee you're
[82:10] very likely to like just stay motivated
[82:14] because you are in a in like a line
[82:16] where it's easy to work but what happens
[82:20] when there are no guardrails there's
[82:22] there's not no support structure for you
[82:25] that's just like you yourself
[82:28] and and I so that that becomes very
[82:31] difficult and I struggle with that a lot
[82:34] uh but what helped me is building those
[82:38] support structures just for myself like
[82:40] building like okay like I want to push a
[82:43] podcast every day so what is the minimum
[82:45] amount of work I have to do okay then I
[82:48] stand up in the morning 500 a.m. every
[82:50] day and the first thing I do is that
[82:54] minimum amount of work that I have to do
[82:57] and I'm usually done with that at 8:
[82:59] a.m. then I right now I have the the
[83:02] thing where I go after that to do the
[83:04] calisthenics Park work out then come
[83:07] back eat something uh first uh first um
[83:11] um breakfast and then I go again till uh
[83:15] till midday eat something then I go
[83:17] again so it's like I actually uh usually
[83:21] um out do my minimum uh and sometimes
[83:25] for example this week is a really hard
[83:27] week because I had to pump up my minimum
[83:30] by two twox because next week I'm the
[83:33] whole week in El Salvador and I just
[83:36] assume that I don't have time the whole
[83:37] week to work I'm probably have some time
[83:40] to to work there also and I probably
[83:41] have to work a little bit there but I
[83:43] just assume that I don't have work so I
[83:45] have to pre-work
[83:47] everything for next week to make this
[83:50] week
[83:51] possible um so uh my daily Mini
[83:55] is 2X highers and higher and I just see
[83:59] how this is [ __ ] with my mind right
[84:03] how this this little bit higher is just
[84:05] like oh like oh oh that's hard H oh no I
[84:09] have to relax no I should should not go
[84:11] too too hard oh no like let's watch the
[84:14] election because I have to do that
[84:16] because yeah whatever so like you you
[84:18] come up with all those excuses do not go
[84:21] hard but then uh the best working day is
[84:24] where I have a really tight schedule and
[84:27] I just work it the whole damn time like
[84:29] I I just like stand up at 5: and and
[84:31] work till 8 uh p and then then it's like
[84:34] then I look back at the day I'm like oh
[84:36] man I I didn't even look at my phone
[84:39] like didn't even had the time to scroll
[84:41] on Instagram I didn't even have time to
[84:44] uh to to to mess around because I had
[84:47] the whole time uh packed with work and
[84:51] to be honest um you need both like you
[84:54] need those days where you just like pack
[84:56] everything and you just go and then uh
[84:59] maybe it's good to have like one day
[85:01] every once in a while to lay a little
[85:03] bit low and have those creative ideas
[85:06] and and think of like oh like I could do
[85:08] that uh but um you should not you should
[85:12] not only have those days where you're
[85:14] just like laying and like uh
[85:17] procrastinating but there is some value
[85:19] also in procrastinating so I do also
[85:22] want to note that yeah well like all of
[85:25] those things you mentioned are
[85:26] resistance and we were talking about
[85:28] monetary premium earlier like there has
[85:31] been a monetary premium put on our
[85:34] attention so um there's literally a
[85:37] company out there saying like how can we
[85:39] steal your your attention and put it on
[85:42] our product right your your focus has
[85:45] been
[85:47] commoditized right so that's a form of
[85:50] resistance that's pretty sick and you
[85:53] know we've seen all these um different
[85:55] documentaries where they're like you
[85:57] know they're attacking your brain stem
[85:59] they're they're literally figuring out
[86:01] what colors and what songs and whatever
[86:04] on Tik Tok that stimulates your brain in
[86:06] a way and then next thing you know you
[86:08] lose like two hours of your life of your
[86:11] focus right and just to just to operate
[86:15] a podcast which is like digital
[86:18] obviously but then also have to like
[86:20] disconnect digitally must be like a
[86:23] weird kind of line to draw because yeah
[86:25] like you said I need to be informed
[86:26] about the election but I don't need to
[86:28] be watching three hours of it right like
[86:30] how do you do that it's it's really hard
[86:34] because um okay Twitter is really good
[86:37] in stealing my attention because Twitter
[86:38] knows really good what I like uh so I
[86:42] find myself like editing the description
[86:45] of a podcast uh and then I have to fill
[86:50] in the contact uh of of my guest and
[86:52] then I go on there x.com open the
[86:56] website oh what pops up interesting
[86:58] interesting 10 minutes later like wait
[87:02] why am on X
[87:03] scrolling why am I doing that and then
[87:06] like oh yeah I I wanted to find the
[87:08] guest's uh contact uol so I can put it
[87:10] in the description as I every day do uh
[87:14] but then uh I find guardrails around
[87:17] that so instead of going to x.com I go
[87:20] to uh pro. x.com where I can Define how
[87:23] X looks and then I only get into my
[87:27] messages and my messages are not as
[87:30] distractive as the for you page so I go
[87:33] in there and search a name and go
[87:35] directly on his profile copy the ual and
[87:37] put it in the description so I just try
[87:39] to analyze where I get distracted
[87:42] because I 100% do I'm I'm I'm not David
[87:46] gargin
[87:48] right I'm so sorry I'm not so uh I have
[87:53] to put up rails for myself to stay
[87:56] focused to to keep that Focus for as
[87:59] long as possible and I like to just like
[88:03] have go times and lay times where like
[88:07] those are the times I just like go as
[88:09] hard as possible and I'm really focused
[88:11] working and then I have like lay times
[88:13] where I just lay on the couch and do
[88:15] tomb scrolling but there's an Associated
[88:17] time where I'm like okay the next 30
[88:20] minutes I just lay there either I don't
[88:22] do anything or I watch something on
[88:24] Netflix or I play chess I really like
[88:27] playing chess on my phone that's also
[88:29] something that distracts me a lot uh and
[88:31] I keep telling me that's a good thing
[88:33] but I don't think that's a good thing to
[88:35] to play chess all the
[88:37] time when you're not a professional
[88:39] chess player uh but yeah
[88:42] like I I like I like when I Define okay
[88:47] where is my go time where I don't want
[88:49] to be distracted and where is my lay
[88:51] time where it's okay to be on chess.com
[88:55] playing uh till the uh till the the time
[88:59] is up right yeah it sounds like you have
[89:02] just like full control over your time
[89:04] and I mean that that's like a a value of
[89:07] all bitcoiners like our time is valuable
[89:10] is time is scarce Bitcoin is scarce it's
[89:12] like therefore if time is scarce then I
[89:15] need to control it because I value it
[89:17] right so you're blocking out times like
[89:19] in a disciplined fashion to take care of
[89:22] your craft and that's impressive that's
[89:25] one of the most most people can't do
[89:26] that right it's it's something I I
[89:29] really want to noce here because uh you
[89:31] said before with gravity and and that's
[89:33] so true like it's it's not like you
[89:36] figure it once out and all of the sudden
[89:37] it's good no you and you have to keep
[89:40] fighting the distractions uh will keep
[89:43] coming and they the the better you get
[89:46] uh like uh the better you get in
[89:49] fighting distractions the the better I
[89:51] feel like the distractions get hey
[89:55] yeah the distractions come bigger uh and
[89:58] they get better uh in in distracting you
[90:01] and and different things distract you
[90:03] but there are still
[90:04] distractions uh and uh opportunities
[90:07] arise and and uh and it's like oh like
[90:10] should I do this no no no no stay stay
[90:12] [ __ ] focused like like this is this
[90:14] is where you should be and that that
[90:16] that's where the thing is and uh saying
[90:19] no to things and and and saying uh I'm
[90:22] sticking with that and I commed to that
[90:24] that's super hard like I struggle with
[90:28] that to be honest but the discipline
[90:31] to like that's one thing you have to be
[90:33] disciplined about um not just wasting
[90:36] your time with like Doom scrolling on
[90:38] Instagram that's an obvious one you n
[90:42] 99% uh chance you wasted your time uh
[90:46] but then there's also opportunities
[90:47] coming you're like hey uh Hey I want to
[90:50] meet you for coffee I have an
[90:51] interesting idea okay do you go do you
[90:53] go to that coffee because if you go to
[90:55] that coffee that takes you out of the
[90:56] work mode and that might ruin your whole
[90:59] day right the the resistance becomes
[91:01] more sophisticated right it's like more
[91:04] uh temp more Temptation like oh yeah
[91:07] like oh I should go see that friend like
[91:09] you know that you know social
[91:11] interactions good for you and like you
[91:12] start convincing yourself like oh yeah I
[91:14] need this right it's like no you need to
[91:17] work on your craft right and you need to
[91:20] offer this discipline to get the the
[91:23] results from The Muse right yeah it's a
[91:26] a it's crazy it's crazy but uh good for
[91:29] you for fighting it's obviously resulted
[91:33] in a great podcast so thank you so much
[91:36] yeah it's uh it's a it's a great
[91:39] pleasure doing that and it keeps me it
[91:41] keeps it keeps me accountable because uh
[91:44] I have a lot of people that would
[91:48] probably be at least dming me or writing
[91:52] me if all of the sudden for some reason
[91:54] one day the podcast is not coming out
[91:57] because I have been so consistent every
[92:00] day Monday to Sunday every day for
[92:03] months now uh and this is my 305th
[92:07] episode so I'm cracking on the like one
[92:10] year uh one year long uh being every day
[92:13] on uh so I have this public
[92:15] accountability which is amazing uh uh
[92:18] when you have a podcast because like
[92:19] everyone can hold you accountable to
[92:21] that and I will not fail like like
[92:25] there's a podcast episode coming out
[92:27] every day 2 p.m GMT plus one or GMT plus
[92:31] plus two depends on if it's summer time
[92:33] or winter
[92:34] time wow people message you like if you
[92:37] if you didn't people would be like are
[92:38] you okay messaging you are you okay did
[92:40] something
[92:41] happen I think I think so actually like
[92:44] I think if if a if I miss a whole day uh
[92:48] there might be something like one two
[92:49] people that that that watch it every day
[92:52] uh maybe like a few more that watch it
[92:54] every day probably they like a good
[92:56] amount of people I mean there are
[92:57] probably way more than that because
[92:59] there are around 50 to 50,000 to 100,000
[93:03] people watching every month uh so on a
[93:05] daily basis there are probably a few
[93:07] hundred maybe even maybe even close to
[93:10] thousand probably a few hundred that
[93:12] watch every day or close to every day uh
[93:15] so uh some of them would definitely DM
[93:19] me and after a week if I let out a whole
[93:21] week then I think my my inbox is
[93:24] wow so like like what was it like when
[93:26] you first started figuring out like what
[93:28] kind of equipment what kind of software
[93:30] programs like do you use AI to to edit
[93:35] like what was it like going through and
[93:36] figuring out because it's really
[93:38] polished like seems like you have really
[93:40] good equipment the audio is good like um
[93:42] you like you said you're spinning out
[93:44] every every day and the quality is so
[93:48] high I'm just like interested in like
[93:50] how did you figure out the best uh
[93:53] equipment
[93:54] setup uh a lot of YouTube watching yeah
[93:58] yeah and and and just testing and I'm
[94:01] I'm kind of obsessed with not only
[94:03] bringing out the quantity every day but
[94:05] also polishing it up and making it
[94:10] better and I think the best learning I
[94:12] have from all that that you can apply to
[94:15] everything is um start with just what
[94:20] you have like like start with with
[94:22] whatever you can do uh and when you look
[94:24] at my first episode it's uh completely
[94:27] different to my episode that to this
[94:29] episode that is currently out uh it's
[94:32] it's completely different and what I did
[94:34] every time I improved something I made
[94:37] sure that the Improvement is something
[94:40] stackable like I don't improve my
[94:43] episode if it's just for one episode I
[94:45] had the even suggestions from guest like
[94:48] hey can you do that can you do that uh
[94:51] for example hey can you do b roll for me
[94:53] you do like in the podcast uh when I
[94:56] talk about a topic put that picture in
[94:59] and I said like no it's too much time
[95:01] right now and I can I could could only
[95:03] do it for you and I could not stack that
[95:06] uh Improvement of the bit of the podcast
[95:08] so I will not implement it so every
[95:10] Improvement that comes to the podcast is
[95:13] stacked and then comes to every podcast
[95:17] after that till I decide there might be
[95:19] something better uh so everything that I
[95:22] improve is stacked on top of each other
[95:25] and then what happens after like 100 or
[95:28] 200 episodes uh you have all those small
[95:32] Stacks that every time you release
[95:34] something you better and better and
[95:35] better and better and then you look like
[95:38] 100 episodes back and you like oh like
[95:40] there's a lot of development going but
[95:42] you didn't notice it because every time
[95:45] it got a little bit better it's just
[95:46] like a a very small detail that I maybe
[95:49] changed and there are some episodes that
[95:51] don't change anything right frankly like
[95:53] there are some epod that don't change
[95:55] anything so I think to to keep it
[95:58] generalized and we can go in detail if
[96:01] you want to but to keep it generalized I
[96:04] I try to find um improvements that make
[96:07] sense and then I can stack onto all the
[96:10] other things I already do and keep it as
[96:13] efficient and simple as possible because
[96:15] I do a lot of work to do one podcast per
[96:18] day uh and if it's too complicated I
[96:20] don't do it there's a lot of things that
[96:23] for examp example right now I do switch
[96:26] between two uh split screen and the full
[96:29] screen and I didn't do that from the
[96:32] beginning why do I do it now because now
[96:35] ai does it for me right I I I didn't AI
[96:39] uh feature was enabled on Riverside and
[96:42] I just had to click a button and since
[96:45] then every episode is a little bit more
[96:47] interact uh with a little bit more
[96:49] interactions so that's how I try think
[96:52] and stack that's that's so don't try to
[96:56] like figure out how to do the next
[96:57] podcast episode better how to try to
[97:00] figure out like how to do all the
[97:02] episodes from now on a little bit better
[97:05] and stack those on top of it I think
[97:06] that's the the biggest learning I had to
[97:09] find I think that's
[97:11] actually um applicable probably for
[97:14] everything you do I think that there's
[97:16] nothing you like just like get a little
[97:18] bit better with whatever you do uh and
[97:21] try to implement something
[97:24] that uh will also be relevant in like a
[97:29] half year or year and something like
[97:31] that so that that that's I hope that's
[97:34] that's I hope that is valuable no that's
[97:37] that's uh I totally understand it's what
[97:40] comes to mind is when people say oh I'm
[97:41] starting this new diet or this fitness
[97:44] challenge it's like well that is
[97:46] completely unsustainable and you're
[97:47] going to last uh however long it's a
[97:49] three-week challenge after that you're
[97:51] going to go back to the same stuff that
[97:53] you're doing before and probably put put
[97:55] the weight back on or you know whatever
[97:57] so yeah that's I think that's uh wise
[98:00] advice just just slow improvements like
[98:02] oh I bought new microphones like the
[98:04] next episode you're going to use the
[98:05] same microphone like the next I have an
[98:09] editing software like you said I'm using
[98:10] AI for the split screen well that's just
[98:12] one click or it's automatic even
[98:15] automate it and then it just keeps
[98:16] building on itself oh that's smart it's
[98:19] really smart AB absolutely perfect but
[98:22] yeah this podcast has been has been
[98:23] going very long actually already yeah I
[98:26] didn't even notice it that we already uh
[98:29] so far in I think the the honestly the
[98:31] conversations the last two three weeks
[98:34] um has been amazing I feel like I'm I'm
[98:37] coming into a whole new podcast
[98:39] recording flow like I really get into
[98:42] this conversation um so that that's
[98:45] great I hope you also uh enjoyed it um I
[98:48] have one question uh that I always ask
[98:50] my guest and this the question what can
[98:53] we learn from you besides Bitcoin and
[98:56] maybe besides all the things that we
[98:57] already talked about yeah sure um I've
[99:00] been thinking about this a lot and uh I
[99:03] don't know maybe just
[99:04] my my upbringing like I was um I was
[99:07] born in uh in Edmonton Alberta and uh
[99:11] grew up in like Northern Alberta kind of
[99:13] in a small oil oil and gas and Forestry
[99:16] town and uh yeah my my father actually
[99:20] runs um a business that is like with
[99:24] hunting and fishing like he's a he's an
[99:26] Outfitter so we have like clients come
[99:28] and come hunting from from the states
[99:31] and and I was a guide for him you know
[99:34] whole life before I moved to Sweden I I
[99:36] would do that like on different hunting
[99:37] seasons so we'd take like white tailed
[99:39] deer hunters out or black bear hunters
[99:41] out and and uh yeah so it's it's been a
[99:45] really uh nice education like since I
[99:49] was a little boy like getting to
[99:50] interact with like people from another
[99:52] country and you know they're they're uh
[99:56] operating in a different currency and
[99:58] they're uh you know I was able to learn
[100:02] that you know the world isn't so small
[100:04] the world is a big place and it's not so
[100:06] scary and you can you can travel and see
[100:08] the world and interact with other
[100:10] cultures and other people and um and
[100:12] then the hunting side is a lot of proof
[100:14] of work you know to to be able to go out
[100:17] and hunt and and and get your targeted
[100:20] animal that you want that it takes a lot
[100:22] of work and you're fighting conditions
[100:25] and and uh all kind of things so it's a
[100:29] yeah same thing you got to put the
[100:30] discipline in put hard work in upgrade
[100:32] your skills and then eventually it pays
[100:34] off so that's been a kind of like a
[100:37] value system that I've had for a long
[100:38] time and and it's kind of led me to the
[100:40] path where I am now
[100:43] so I love that that's uh that's that's
[100:46] Beau and I think it really fits nicely
[100:48] to to the episode we we did uh which um
[100:53] it's people um outside of
[100:57] Bitcoin when I talk about the podcast
[101:00] and I say to them I do it daily uh
[101:03] because first of all like when I say
[101:04] daily most people think that I do it
[101:06] Monday to Friday I also do Saturday
[101:09] Sunday um but they keep asking me like
[101:11] oh is there so much to discuss on on
[101:13] bitcoin and I like first of all like yes
[101:17] and and second of all um the Bitcoin
[101:21] Community really likes to die
[101:23] deep into everything I did a whole
[101:26] episode around parenting where we did
[101:27] not even talk about Bitcoin with Lia
[101:30] huff and it was an amazing episode and
[101:32] people loved it also like the the
[101:34] average food duration and all the
[101:35] statistics that i g gather from every
[101:38] podcast the same as as every time like
[101:40] people enjoyed it uh so I think uh the
[101:44] Bitcoin Community is a special one where
[101:45] you can have a Bitcoin podcast and talk
[101:48] about everything else too wow which is
[101:52] amazing
[101:55] just uh just getting to meet all these
[101:57] interesting people that's that's really
[101:59] cool I'm uh I'm kind of in a Bitcoin
[102:03] University and I get paid for it and
[102:05] that's how I see it wow live in the
[102:08] dream I'm trying to live in the dream uh
[102:13] as much as I can yeah um yeah perfect
[102:15] then uh we have end in the podcast where
[102:17] the previous guest is asking a question
[102:18] for the next guest without knowing who
[102:20] the next guest um actually is and the
[102:22] question is
[102:23] very uh Bitcoin and scaling uh like do
[102:28] you run a self- custodial lightning note
[102:31] and if not why
[102:34] um I I guess I'm just not at that uh
[102:37] that
[102:38] level like techn Tech technically I just
[102:41] I don't run one every time I I am asked
[102:45] about do you run a node I always with
[102:49] shame have to say no so it's on my list
[102:52] um I want to get a node running Before
[102:54] Christmas that's my goal so a lightning
[102:57] node or are you talking just a regular
[103:00] node I need to get one going before
[103:01] Christmas so it's a guilt guilty thing
[103:03] that's on my mind all the time so it's
[103:06] uh I have to do
[103:08] that I it has some benefits like uh it's
[103:12] it's great how the incentive structure
[103:13] also in Bitcoin works because if you run
[103:16] a full note obviously you also
[103:18] contribute to the decentralization of
[103:19] Bitcoin but you also have your own um
[103:23] uh incentives to do so with privacy and
[103:27] other things in in mind so I think it's
[103:30] a it's a great thing and um I always
[103:33] tell people at least try it yeah like I
[103:37] right now uh there's no active node
[103:39] running in in my home uh but there will
[103:43] come again and I already tried it so
[103:46] like uh I think the the education
[103:49] especially as we do it early bitcoiners
[103:51] I think we we kind of have to do uh but
[103:55] uh I'm not in the camp that says oh you
[103:59] have to run a bitco note because you're
[104:01] a bitcoiner no like if if that's true
[104:05] then Bitcoin is doomed to fail like if
[104:08] the incentive structure is not good
[104:10] enough to to have a decentralized
[104:12] Bitcoin node operation um then then then
[104:17] it will not succeed but it will succeed
[104:19] because the in incentive structure is
[104:21] there and and people really like to run
[104:23] no so like that's that's kind of my my
[104:26] take on that so like you don't have to
[104:28] run a note if you don't want you can
[104:29] just stack like there's nothing wrong
[104:31] with that yeah that's that's always like
[104:33] my when I get really motivated okay I'm
[104:35] gonna go and you know buy like a used
[104:37] laptop or get one on Amazon I'm going to
[104:39] do this and install Linux and do all
[104:41] this stuff and then it's just like yeah
[104:42] well the price just dipped maybe I
[104:45] should just maybe I should just stack
[104:48] and then and then just like smash by
[104:50] it's like okay well there goes my my
[104:52] laptop Amazon Amazon purchase or
[104:54] whatever or my whatever kind of node
[104:56] that people are selling online or
[104:58] whatever so yeah it's my it's a it's
[105:01] shameful that I I don't but that's my
[105:03] honest answer I don't run one because
[105:05] maybe I'm too cheap and I just want to
[105:07] Stack that right now I don't think I
[105:10] don't think it's it's shameful uh but uh
[105:13] I I I do think you you I mean you can
[105:17] even draw like on on your laptop that
[105:18] you have and then just like like do it
[105:21] there as as like an education thing uh
[105:24] but yeah it's it's definitely something
[105:26] I I don't think it's it's shameful like
[105:28] it if it would be shameful I think it
[105:29] would be I think it would be bad for the
[105:32] Bitcoin Community overall if that would
[105:34] be obligator like if that's like really
[105:36] something uh and and and sometimes we
[105:39] are too toxic about stuff yeah yeah it's
[105:42] on the list I'm gonna get it done so I
[105:45] have I have a goal Before Christmas
[105:47] Christmas perfect then uh we we can hold
[105:50] you accountable uh when we have your a
[105:53] second time on the podcast and then I'll
