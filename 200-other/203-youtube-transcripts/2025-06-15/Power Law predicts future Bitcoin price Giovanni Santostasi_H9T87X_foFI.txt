[00:00] how can we predict the price of Bitcoin
[00:02] we're not going to see anything below
[00:04] 60,000 ever in the history of Bitcoin
[00:06] what does happen when Apple tomorrow
[00:08] comes out and says uh we are now buying
[00:11] with all our reserves Bitcoin we have
[00:13] the strategies called weight DCA so we
[00:15] are going to give a weight to the
[00:17] different phases of where you are when
[00:19] will we break the 1 million US dollar
[00:22] barrier we should reach 1
[00:25] million as a full disclosure I want to
[00:27] start off with um I I only Buy and Hold
[00:32] Bitcoin so those uh models are really
[00:35] interesting for me to see patterns to
[00:37] see uh things but uh I'm just like a
[00:40] hodler I'm just buying Bitcoin yeah but
[00:43] um you will see I'm actually going to
[00:45] explain it is also useful for odler
[00:48] because uh and I will explain why you
[00:50] know because I think it goes from
[00:52] everything right from somebody who wants
[00:53] to be a little bit more aggressive to
[00:56] actually somebody that is a holder
[00:57] because you know let's say
[01:00] and we are already recording yeah yeah
[01:03] yeah yeah okay so let's say for example
[01:07] um I don't know let's say we were last
[01:09] cycle right and uh we know that Bitcoin
[01:13] we picked 70,000 right and three days in
[01:16] advance I'm going to tell you hey uh
[01:20] it's going to be in three day from now
[01:22] we're going to reach a
[01:23] peak wait wait a little bit wait you
[01:26] know you have all this money saved up
[01:28] for buying Bitcoin right because maybe
[01:30] you're doing it on a monthly basis or
[01:32] whatever you do you do some
[01:34] DCA wait a little bit you know wait a
[01:38] few months because it's going from
[01:42] 70,000 to 16,000 if you wait this amount
[01:45] of time and in fact you don't you don't
[01:48] even need to wait 16,000 wait until it's
[01:51] 30 wait until it's 25 and my algo can
[01:54] tell you how long is going to take when
[01:57] we are going to reach the bottom and
[01:59] when it's time to buy again right you
[02:01] can always wait a little bit right to
[02:03] buy your Bitcoin of course you say well
[02:06] buten is the risk is is going up right
[02:08] and you're are wrong well of course
[02:10] right there is a risk on everything but
[02:12] this is a limited risk right so you can
[02:14] still do your odling and you only buy
[02:17] policy but also
[02:20] maybe understand Bitcoin you know it's
[02:23] like if we love Bitcoin we also need it
[02:25] to understand and I think I found a way
[02:28] to actually understand what really Bon
[02:30] is doing now you have to trust my you
[02:33] know my my understanding and my model
[02:36] but uh there is space Also for odler in
[02:39] this approach so everybody can help can
[02:43] be helped by this knowledge of of a cyes
[02:47] yeah that's why I'm really interested in
[02:48] it because you can always like have an
[02:50] DCA plan but still buy chunks here and
[02:54] area um we we have the strategies called
[02:57] weighty DCA so we are going to give a we
[03:00] to the different phases of where you are
[03:02] in fact right now we are even developing
[03:05] this terminology we explain in a know
[03:07] later over a clock we can tell you what
[03:10] is a Bitcoin time in the cycle and
[03:13] according to where we are in the clock
[03:15] you can give a weit right I'm going to
[03:17] buy more when we are here and I'm not
[03:19] going to buy much here and so on so you
[03:23] don't have to buy and sell uh even if
[03:26] that is a possible approach you can also
[03:29] just simply
[03:30] by the right time you know so it's also
[03:32] good for aing maybe let's start right
[03:35] into it like what is the the power law
[03:38] um outside of Bitcoin because it's a
[03:40] thing outside of Bitcoin also yes what
[03:42] is it in in in the most simple terms
[03:45] okay sure
[03:48] so you know I am a physicist that is my
[03:51] background right uh and uh uh so physics
[03:54] is a the study of nature right this in
[03:57] fact what this what it means physics
[03:58] means nature and so
[04:02] um we want to understand different
[04:05] patterns in nature right usually uh if
[04:10] we want to express it in with some kind
[04:12] of mathematical formula right like like
[04:14] a relationship between things and then
[04:17] once we found find the particular
[04:19] pattern and the mathematical formula
[04:21] that describe uh these a particular
[04:24] phenomena we want to understand it we
[04:26] want to go deeper and try to see why is
[04:29] behaving in this way but you know the
[04:31] first step is always finding these
[04:32] relationships right so for example I use
[04:35] this all the time because it's probably
[04:38] the first time that scientists talked
[04:42] about some kind of a power law I think
[04:44] actually it was another example and uh
[04:48] um and that example was Galileo so we
[04:50] can also use that so let me give you a
[04:52] couple of historical examples right so
[04:55] the first historical example was Galileo
[04:58] so he you know from my country I'm
[05:00] Italian he's also you know it's like he
[05:02] kind of actually created a field of
[05:04] physics is he was the first one he also
[05:07] came up with this idea of a scientific
[05:09] method you know how to explore something
[05:11] with a scientific approach and different
[05:13] steps to do that so uh he he he
[05:18] understood he was studying animals and
[05:20] you see at that time you know there was
[05:23] still this Aristotelian way of looking
[05:25] at the world you know it was like a
[05:27] making analogy uh he was not as
[05:30] scientific as Galileo did he he actually
[05:33] has this famous phrase that says nature
[05:36] is a book and is written in the language
[05:40] of mathematics so beautiful right
[05:42] because it really applies to what we are
[05:44] discussing here so in this case what in
[05:46] the power law what he was trying to
[05:49] understand how animal size up in fact
[05:52] actually this is a very good example
[05:54] also in terms of this idea of sizing up
[05:56] what sizing up means right so if I start
[06:00] something that goes from being a small
[06:03] thing to a something that is much larger
[06:06] I'm not interested in small little
[06:08] changes I want to see what happens when
[06:11] you know the animal becomes maybe you
[06:13] know 10% bigger 20% bigger 30% bigger or
[06:17] you know if you have something that also
[06:19] change by a lot like for example Bitcoin
[06:21] right they went from being a few cents
[06:23] to almost
[06:25] $100,000 right that every time it
[06:28] changes by a factor of 10 so it goes
[06:30] from 0.1 1 10 100,000 and so on that is
[06:36] size you know that is one term the other
[06:38] term we use is scale you know the scale
[06:41] so if you focus if you try to forget
[06:45] details but you look at these large CH
[06:50] changes and try to see what happens
[06:53] maybe like for example you're looking at
[06:56] time in this case how the how much time
[06:58] it takes to change right or maybe a
[07:02] relationship between two things like for
[07:04] example in the case of Galileo he was
[07:06] looking at how big an animal um how big
[07:11] an animal becomes uh as he grows and he
[07:14] realized that basically you know I know
[07:17] we make this joke in physics that we
[07:20] call them the spherical cows you know
[07:23] like if you're are trying to understand
[07:24] a cow make it to a sphere you know
[07:28] initially at least later you can go in
[07:30] the details but initially think it as a
[07:33] sphere because sphere is so simple to
[07:35] describe right it's an approximation so
[07:38] let's if you imagine an animal be being
[07:40] kind of a blob thing right a sphere uh
[07:44] you know a sphere spherical cow and the
[07:46] cow grows you know it grows with let's
[07:49] say with the radius right bigger the
[07:51] radius bigger the cow and then with what
[07:55] quantity exactly well the cube right
[07:57] because a volume the volume of a cow GRS
[08:00] with the cube right so and mass is the
[08:04] same right bigger the volume if the
[08:06] density is the
[08:07] same uh bigger the mass right and so and
[08:12] and is going up with the cube so if I
[08:15] for example double the size of an animal
[08:19] the mass of the animal doesn't go up by
[08:21] a factor of two it goes by a factor of
[08:23] eight because it's two to the three
[08:25] right if I if animal becomes three times
[08:28] when I have to take the three to the to
[08:31] the cube right so 3 three three right so
[08:34] that is uh 27 so you see um it's
[08:39] important to understand how something
[08:40] scales in terms of the power you see the
[08:43] power here is a cube okay so this is one
[08:46] of the clue to understand uh Power lows
[08:50] and this why they are called Power
[08:52] because we're talking about some
[08:53] quantity raised to the power right and
[08:57] the power can be two three like for
[08:59] example volume goes up with the cube
[09:03] what about the area the area for example
[09:06] of the feet of an animal right the
[09:08] animal needs to walk and usually like in
[09:12] our case our feet touch the ground right
[09:15] and that is the area of the animal uh
[09:18] and that
[09:20] area how does it grow it doesn't grow
[09:22] with a cube it grows with the square
[09:26] right because this what with are is so
[09:30] this is another relationship that goes
[09:33] with the power of the quantity that
[09:36] we're looking at and so he realized that
[09:38] as an animal grows there is kind of a
[09:41] ratio right that is basically how much
[09:43] weight the animal will have on this on
[09:45] the foot right on on his bones because
[09:48] the bones need to make contact with the
[09:51] ground right so it's a question of the
[09:53] volume over the area right so actually
[09:57] that relationship R Cube over Square we
[10:00] get R right so the an as the animal
[10:03] becomes bigger and bigger this
[10:05] relationship between mass and the
[10:08] surface on which an animal can walk it
[10:13] goes up linearly right so it's a
[10:16] straight line in a in a graph and you
[10:19] know if I do uh this quantity that is
[10:22] the ratio between the the mass and the
[10:26] surface area of the animal right that
[10:28] has contact with the ground if you if
[10:31] you take this ratio it goes up right
[10:35] with linearly right these two quantity
[10:38] so there is the r Cube and R square I
[10:41] can make a graph of these two quantity
[10:43] and I get some kind of straight line and
[10:47] whenever you have a relationship of this
[10:49] kind where there is one quantity
[10:51] changing in relationship to another with
[10:55] some kind of a power you can visualize
[10:58] it better by taking a graph of the log
[11:02] of one quantity versus the log of
[11:04] another so this type of graph that no
[11:07] many people are familiar but in physics
[11:09] we are very familiar with is called a
[11:11] log log graph and if something as a type
[11:14] of relationship that I describe that
[11:16] depends on the power then it looks like
[11:19] a straight line and this is what
[11:20] happened also with Kepler I was
[11:22] mentioning because uh you know in this
[11:24] case I tell this story all the time
[11:26] because actually in a sense this where a
[11:28] really this idea of plotting things in a
[11:31] log l graph started uh he was looking
[11:34] for a pattern in the universe because he
[11:37] thought the planets were not moving just
[11:39] by chance but because it was some kind
[11:42] of underlying law you know he was not
[11:44] aware of the law yet you know again he
[11:47] you remember this was a the beginning of
[11:50] science so we were still influenced by
[11:51] all these ancient ideas you know about
[11:55] planets moving in perfect orbits you
[11:58] know we had all kind kind of mystical
[11:59] idea about a universe but you know he
[12:02] wanted to start to use math to actually
[12:05] understand if it was a very specific
[12:07] pattern and so he tried many different
[12:09] things and finally because log was
[12:11] something the log uh you know the log
[12:15] basically what the log does so if I have
[12:18] a let's say log of 10 right is this
[12:20] function and that apply to a number like
[12:22] 100 it gives me the power so 10 to the
[12:25] two is 100 right and so if I take the
[12:29] log 10 of 10 to the two the answer is
[12:33] two if I take the log of 1,00 because
[12:37] 1000 is 10 to the three the answer of
[12:40] that operation of taking the log is
[12:42] three and so on so you see it's almost
[12:44] like I'm asking through the log what is
[12:47] the size of this number right and it
[12:49] gives me gives me the power the power is
[12:52] the size right so he did this thing he
[12:54] took the distance of the planets from
[12:57] the Sun because we knew right other
[12:59] hundreds of century and Century
[13:01] observations of the planets of a move
[13:03] and so on so we had all these very
[13:05] detailed information all on paper it was
[13:07] crazy you know they did all this we
[13:09] didn't have computers at the time we had
[13:11] to do everything on paper very carefully
[13:13] very accurately I don't know how they
[13:16] did it because you know modern
[13:17] scientists don't have that feeling we do
[13:19] everything by computers uh and and so he
[13:23] he he measured right he wrote down the
[13:27] numbers associated with the distance of
[13:30] the of a planet and it took the log of
[13:34] this distance and then on the y axis he
[13:37] had the time the log of the time or you
[13:40] know you can do the other way around it
[13:42] doesn't matter uh the log of time right
[13:46] the in fact let me put it in the Y A on
[13:49] the x- axis because it's what I did with
[13:51] Bitcoin so he put the log of time in the
[13:55] in the x axis and U um and the time in
[13:59] this case is the time that it takes the
[14:01] planet to go around the sun right so
[14:04] when he did that he was shocked because
[14:07] you could see this beautiful organized I
[14:10] have a graphit I can show you in a
[14:12] moment beautiful organized line you know
[14:16] all the planets were little dots and you
[14:19] could like draw there are mathematical
[14:22] techniques to draw these lines but in
[14:24] that case you could draw it by hand you
[14:26] could just join the dots because they
[14:28] were so perfect
[14:29] along this line that you could do it by
[14:32] hand almost and and he was shocked and
[14:35] then because he knew the mathematics it
[14:37] could write a formula that tells you how
[14:40] long a planet takes to go around as a
[14:44] function of his distance or vice versa
[14:46] right so if I know how long it takes a
[14:49] planet uh to go because this is usually
[14:51] what You observe you look at this planet
[14:53] you see when he comes back in the same
[14:55] spot of the sky some of the planets take
[14:57] years and years you have to be very
[14:58] patient Jupiter takes 12 years right
[15:01] imagine being there every night for 12
[15:03] years like a Bitcoin it took 12 years
[15:05] right 15 years and in one one B more
[15:08] than the life of Bitcoin and Jupiter
[15:10] comes back right and you then if you
[15:14] have that information even if it is a no
[15:16] a planet that you never saw before
[15:18] because of this law you can say oh I
[15:20] know how long it takes to go around the
[15:22] Sun h no distance now even if you not
[15:25] measure because because there is this
[15:27] law all the planet then follow it and so
[15:30] by that time right so it's several
[15:33] hundred years we found hundred and
[15:36] hundred and hundreds of these power loss
[15:38] everywhere in nature so it's not really
[15:40] like oh that is the main thing about
[15:43] physics but it's really a big chunk like
[15:47] a lot a lot of phenomena and the
[15:49] interesting thing right so in physics we
[15:52] really like when we see what is called
[15:55] universality so different phenomena
[15:59] doesn't seem like what Bitcoin has to do
[16:01] with the planets right and this is one
[16:03] of the things that I hear all the time
[16:05] from people that don't know science of
[16:06] they don't know
[16:08] physics what has what is a corresponding
[16:11] why there is any relationship well
[16:14] because ex what we do in physics exactly
[16:17] that we look for oh you know this thing
[16:19] behaves like this other we have the same
[16:21] behavior so in a sense we are the same
[16:24] like for example waves right this is
[16:26] another thing that we study in physics
[16:28] the wave waves in the sea the sound you
[16:31] know that we hear that is a wave the
[16:34] light is a wave right very different
[16:36] level of abstractions of a wave because
[16:39] you know usually you don't see light as
[16:40] a wave but it is a wave it is a wave and
[16:43] this what we physics we get really
[16:46] really excited when we see this
[16:48] Universal pattern different phenomena
[16:50] that behaves very similarly and they can
[16:52] describe the same laws you know it it
[16:55] gets excited I don't know we you know we
[16:57] are a a bunch of nerds but it's really
[17:00] important because you know um once you
[17:05] understand the formula behind then you
[17:07] can
[17:08] say how these things behave you know you
[17:11] can use the same questions and say yeah
[17:13] you know sound and light are very
[17:15] different but you know they behave like
[17:17] a wave so I can calculate with speed I
[17:19] can calculate other properties of a wave
[17:21] I can tell you how much energy VI car
[17:23] you know because it's the same formula
[17:25] so this why this why it's very powerful
[17:28] to see this similarity and power lws is
[17:30] one of the keys that allows us to make a
[17:33] lot of connections because you know
[17:35] there are phenomenal in nature like you
[17:38] know how River form How Mountains grow
[17:40] like the other day uh I was showing in
[17:43] my X account how you know there is this
[17:46] article that had a very beautiful graph
[17:48] of how te grow teth grow in a power LW
[17:52] if I make a graph of the size of a tooth
[17:54] and then time how much time of the
[17:57] animal is you know for how long the
[18:00] animal is growing for long the tooth is
[18:02] growing and they do a log of the size of
[18:06] a tooth and the log of time right of
[18:09] growth it's a beautiful power law and
[18:12] there are different Power laws for
[18:13] different animals so you can actually
[18:15] use it as a fingerprint this animal as
[18:17] this slope you know because there are
[18:19] different slope right there are
[18:20] different lines you will have different
[18:22] slope because that slope it turns out to
[18:24] be the power is a you know if you
[18:26] measure the slope is actually the
[18:29] quantity I told you right the equation
[18:31] usually is like y equal the quantity x
[18:36] to the power to the n and that n is the
[18:39] slope of a straight line and that n tell
[18:42] us a lot of information I made a PO um
[18:45] post the other day it was very very
[18:47] popular because I was explaining how if
[18:49] you look at metabolism and the size of
[18:51] the animal you get a again a beautiful
[18:54] straight line for many different animals
[18:56] and the fact that that n is three over
[18:59] four it tell us a lot of things you know
[19:02] and uh people can go on X and look at my
[19:05] post or you know we can spend a couple
[19:08] of minutes to explain if if you are
[19:10] interested but uh so this is the general
[19:13] idea of power law they come up in nature
[19:15] many times is this a relationship very
[19:17] simple relationship but it has a lot of
[19:22] consequences in terms of how things
[19:24] happen how the metabolism of an animal
[19:27] uh Works how
[19:29] um scaling and changing size when we
[19:32] grow you know U how planets move around
[19:36] so so many many different things that
[19:37] are described by different simple laws
[19:40] and it doesn't matter if it's simple
[19:41] that is otheris oh it's so simple it's
[19:44] so silly you know is well this how
[19:47] nature likes it you know nature likes
[19:49] simple things economical things is
[19:51] trying to do something in the most
[19:54] simple and direct and efficient way you
[19:57] know doesn't to be
[19:59] complicated and I I totally get now the
[20:03] the whole power law and how it's
[20:05] connected to Nature and when we now talk
[20:08] about Bitcoin and the power law for me
[20:10] is the one question in mind like there's
[20:13] the human side of things like what does
[20:15] happen when like apple for example
[20:17] tomorrow comes out and says uh we are
[20:20] now buying with all our reserves Bitcoin
[20:22] I mean it's unrealistic but um how does
[20:26] uh the human brain
[20:29] uh and the human factor work in this
[20:32] power law and why does Bitcoin still
[20:34] follow this power law and can this
[20:36] something break this power law in
[20:39] Bitcoin okay very good question so in
[20:41] general let me say let me answer why
[20:44] this power actually come up in human
[20:46] behavior because they don't it's not
[20:48] just Bitcoin right so you will say hey
[20:50] Bitcoin is not a force of nature I use
[20:52] this Logan that I know it's as his
[20:56] limitation because you know it's not
[20:57] really a force of nature in the sense
[20:59] that is something that comes from
[21:01] directly from the natural war first of
[21:03] all humans are part of the natural War
[21:06] so it's still nature uh how humans
[21:10] behave as a group you know why not and
[21:14] second um we find this uh Power laws
[21:18] also in Social phenomena these again uh
[21:22] famous Italian sociologist e Economist
[21:27] his name is Paro probably you heard
[21:29] about him right for example income
[21:31] distributions are um if you take you
[21:35] know how much a person has in terms of
[21:38] income and you look at how many people
[21:41] have that type of income and you
[21:43] organize them and so on you get a power
[21:45] law and it's called the Paro
[21:47] distribution you know he discover there
[21:50] is a very precise like you will say how
[21:52] is possible right people probably have
[21:55] random uh salaries Etc it's a human
[21:58] phenomen
[21:59] maybe you know this count is different
[22:01] this yeah different countries will have
[22:02] different slopes and again you can use
[22:06] it almost like something specific for
[22:07] that country almost like a fingerprint
[22:10] but we still follow that you know it's
[22:12] also called the rule of 8020 because it
[22:14] turns out 80% of the people sometime you
[22:18] know in some countries even worse but
[22:20] 80% of the people sorry 20% of the
[22:23] people own 80% of the resources and that
[22:26] happens in so many different phenomena
[22:27] like a for for example in social media
[22:29] you know 20 80% of the post come from
[22:32] 20% of the people you know this law tell
[22:36] us a lot of things so you will think how
[22:38] is possible that human beings behave in
[22:40] that way you know in social media people
[22:42] do whatever they want they are free to
[22:44] do well I'm not sorry this is how it
[22:47] happens because when people start to
[22:48] interact Etc they follow certain laws
[22:51] you know why that happens well it's much
[22:53] more complicated with human beings we
[22:55] don't know exactly the interaction Etc
[22:58] about so
[22:58] they organize themselves to create this
[23:01] law and you can see them in our cities
[23:03] behave like for example this is
[23:05] something relatively new in the last
[23:07] maybe 20 years there was in particular
[23:09] there is this physicist called Jeffrey
[23:12] West and he has beautiful TED Talks
[23:14] maybe you can link it in your video uh
[23:17] where and also books and paper of course
[23:20] right he's a scientist he publish a lot
[23:21] of it's not just a scientist going
[23:23] around talking about stuff you know you
[23:25] usually write papers you know scientific
[23:27] or the science analyze so it's a very
[23:30] well assed field it's not just a random
[23:33] guy uh it's an entire field of study
[23:35] where people look at cities how City
[23:37] organized for example look at the number
[23:40] of gas station you know you will think
[23:42] the number of gas station in a city it's
[23:45] just random right the city has a m more
[23:48] these others you know fewer maybe you
[23:51] know yes it's proportional to the size
[23:53] of a city but you know I don't expect to
[23:56] see a very precise law no there is such
[23:59] a precise same thing with income same
[24:01] thing with the patents that that city
[24:03] produces same thing with you know
[24:06] hundreds of different type of things
[24:08] that you look they all organized as
[24:10] power power power almost to the point
[24:13] where you know I I made a joke and say
[24:16] and you know is it's all about power law
[24:18] it's it has been all about power law
[24:21] yeah it is you know a lot of things and
[24:23] with Bitcoin in a way is surprising
[24:27] because when you see it with your own
[24:29] eyes because one thing is what the
[24:31] theory says and the other when you
[24:34] actually see it it's amazing because you
[24:38] know first of all is there and is
[24:40] undeniable and second you know it's
[24:44] you're thinking about say of course
[24:46] because Bitcoin is a network and
[24:48] networks hold and behold you know when
[24:51] you have interaction between different
[24:53] agents this how we call them in in
[24:55] physics you know different things that
[24:57] interact with each other in different
[24:59] way right be people that talk about
[25:01] Bitcoin the miners how the miners
[25:04] interact with the the people that trade
[25:06] Bitcoin it's a big interactive Network
[25:10] right uh literally because there are all
[25:12] these nodes around the planet where
[25:14] running the protocol Etc you always
[25:17] almost always you see Power lows
[25:21] expressing and you can even go through
[25:22] the mat and show that yes you will see
[25:25] Power lows and and then you say well but
[25:30] what if uh there is something big you
[25:32] know like the ETF what if Apple like you
[25:35] say right it starts to adopt
[25:38] Bitcoin because they allow it to use it
[25:42] in their Apple store or whatever you
[25:44] know Facebook adopts it Elon mask or
[25:47] whatever it's usually these things do
[25:51] not change the behavior like you know
[25:54] like in a city will say well what if in
[25:57] a city and a c point they invite a big
[26:00] Corporation to come in right like you
[26:02] know remember there was a time when um I
[26:06] don't remember if it was Apple or some
[26:07] other maybe Google you know they were
[26:09] looking for another headquarters right
[26:11] and there different city competing with
[26:13] each other what if that City gets Google
[26:15] coming in in the town will know that
[26:17] change everything the Dynamics of this
[26:19] power law really usually not really
[26:23] because you know what happens the
[26:24] company moved there because the power
[26:27] law What was a the right place that to
[26:29] go to the next step needed something
[26:32] like Google to come in right it's almost
[26:35] like the power law attracts you know
[26:38] because it's it's it's a sign of how
[26:41] evolved the city is how wealthy the city
[26:44] is now there are some exception if a big
[26:47] company like Google come in in a small
[26:49] little town you know that creates some
[26:51] kind of big change Etc and that also is
[26:54] part of the theory how very dramatic
[26:56] changes can affect a network right but
[27:00] usually it it's very rare and this why
[27:03] you see this power loss because if it
[27:05] happen all the time we will not see them
[27:06] right we see just disrupted power loss
[27:09] instead usually the other way around if
[27:12] a network is ready for a the next big
[27:15] event then that event comes but for
[27:18] Bitcoin is a beautiful story because if
[27:20] you think what happened right in this 15
[27:22] years in the beginning was nothing you
[27:24] know it was just Satoshi and some crazy
[27:29] cryptographers you know in a very small
[27:31] little corner of Internet doing their
[27:33] little things about hacking you know
[27:35] white talking and thinking about
[27:37] cryptography and stuff like that he
[27:39] created this thing his friends say some
[27:42] were skeptical some were supporting they
[27:45] come together you know they start to
[27:47] share ideas then Satoshi launch the code
[27:50] some people run it on their computer
[27:52] they use some of their resources they
[27:54] debug it and this makes the network grow
[27:57] more people people hear about it they
[27:59] come in they started to tra you know to
[28:01] trade it between themselves somebody
[28:03] buys a pizza with thousands of Bitcoin
[28:06] you know all these events all these
[28:07] events right uh you know media start to
[28:11] talk about Bitcoin so all these things
[28:13] are happening and it's basically like a
[28:15] feedback loop like this right so
[28:17] something happens it brings the
[28:19] resources the resources make the network
[28:21] work go up and grow the that attracts
[28:24] more resources and so on and so on these
[28:27] when you have a effects like that that
[28:29] we call them in in physics we call
[28:32] multiplicative because you know you have
[28:35] something then is multiplied by the
[28:37] effect of another then is Multiplied so
[28:39] you have like instead of summing things
[28:41] you multiply them that is exactly when
[28:44] you you will expect a power L this why
[28:47] I'm I'm saying to everybody look I'm not
[28:49] just drawing a stupid straight line
[28:51] through data there is an entire
[28:54] philosophy there is an entire
[28:56] understanding if you get this principle
[28:59] then you understand a lot of things of
[29:00] Bitcoin it's almost like a key like a
[29:03] lot of equ that you have about Bitcoin
[29:05] what will happen with the ETF my answer
[29:07] is nothing you see I'm very different
[29:09] from many people because I'm saying this
[29:12] based on some principle that I could be
[29:16] wrong and we will see what the data
[29:18] shows but if this principle is I am
[29:21] trying to be consistent with this
[29:22] principle then I can answer all these
[29:24] questions and you can actually make
[29:26] predictions you can say
[29:28] you can say when is when how many years
[29:33] are we are going to wait before beIN
[29:36] catches up with gold and becomes more
[29:39] valuable than all the gold on earth
[29:41] because of this principle and because of
[29:43] these ideas and because of the
[29:45] mathematical laws that governs Bitcoin
[29:48] that seems to be true I can make this
[29:51] prediction see so it's an entire
[29:53] philosophy an entire understanding of a
[29:56] history of Bitcoin of a future of
[29:58] Bitcoin of the nature of Bitcoin once
[30:00] you understanding as a power L first of
[30:02] all if you like mat if you like you know
[30:06] principles Etc it's so fantastic because
[30:09] you know it's not a random asset it's so
[30:12] weird you know we have this incredible
[30:14] asset that for the first time in human
[30:17] history is not just random you follow a
[30:20] very precise path right so it's a
[30:23] beautiful interesting things even if you
[30:25] are not interested in Bitcoin just
[30:27] studying it and trying to understanding
[30:29] it it's beautiful there is no other way
[30:31] to describe it if you like math and
[30:33] physics Etc you find it beautiful you
[30:35] know it's organized so people resisted
[30:39] but if I am right and this is true the
[30:42] consequences are incredible you know in
[30:44] terms of this social experiment you can
[30:47] call it a social experiment a physics
[30:49] experiment because you know we use
[30:51] energy we transform energy to create
[30:53] this asset you know to create value in
[30:56] the network and so it's really
[30:59] fascinating and and it's powerful it's
[31:03] uh for me still a fascinating thing to
[31:05] to that Bitcoin follows models and we
[31:08] have from the past we have the stock to
[31:10] flow model I think this is something
[31:12] that uh is really popular in the in the
[31:14] Bitcoin scene lately not that much but
[31:17] it was really popular maybe it becomes
[31:19] again really popular and all this um
[31:23] models and now also the power law uh
[31:26] tries to kind of predict where the price
[31:29] is going with different kinds of mythics
[31:32] um the power law is really interesting
[31:34] because it's the first one for me and
[31:37] I'm I'm not a physicist I have I only
[31:41] I'm a software developer so I have not
[31:44] that much understanding of all that uh
[31:46] nature and all th those uh meth methods
[31:50] but as I understand this is the first
[31:51] one that's like tied to Nature and for
[31:54] me Bitcoin is also really tied to Nature
[31:57] and
[31:58] when I now asked the question to you
[32:00] like uh how can we predict the price of
[32:04] Bitcoin and if we now have the last 15
[32:07] years as record where it follows the uh
[32:10] price Model the the the power law uh
[32:15] where will Bitcoin stand in like 15
[32:17] years when will we break the 1 million
[32:20] US dollar
[32:21] barrier um and also another interesting
[32:24] question is is that power law
[32:26] denominated in US dollar the same thing
[32:30] denominated in I don't know Zimbabwe
[32:32] dollar Venezuelan dollars is there
[32:35] difference in in those kinds of um
[32:38] smaller and even uh less powerful uh fat
[32:43] Curren
[32:45] is very good questions okay so one by
[32:48] one so the first one about model so yes
[32:51] it's a great thing that actually you can
[32:54] study Bitcoin and try to make prediction
[32:57] and
[32:58] actually believe me it's not just uh me
[33:02] and uh Plan B that are doing these
[33:04] things uh like with some kind of
[33:06] methodology because of course you know
[33:07] you can always draw a line you can do ta
[33:10] Etc and most of the time it doesn't work
[33:13] because it's mostly based on humans
[33:15] trying to find patterns where they are
[33:17] not because this is how we are
[33:18] programmed right it's a very good thing
[33:20] we are kind of machines we're trying to
[33:23] find pattern because this are what
[33:24] allows us to survive but many times we
[33:27] do
[33:28] mistakes you know we see you know Jesus
[33:31] on a toast you know like oh look at this
[33:33] you know looks like Jesus or you know
[33:35] you see something in the clouds you know
[33:37] when there is nothing in the clouds so
[33:41] people can do that but you know if you
[33:42] have a methodology then you at least you
[33:46] around something like for example as the
[33:48] s2f model it had some value because it
[33:51] had
[33:53] some understanding of C you know like
[33:55] this is what makes the price goes up you
[33:58] know this is the mechanism the U amount
[34:01] of Bitcoins that are mined because of
[34:03] the alving event goes by down by a
[34:05] factor of two so I'm thinking that this
[34:08] what is going to happen so you know I am
[34:09] M actually with I know it received a lot
[34:12] of criticism people got disappointed and
[34:15] I think this what is happening also a
[34:16] little bit with my mother because people
[34:18] got tired and disappointed by s2f and
[34:21] you know we are kind of resisting by
[34:24] telling everybody that actually we have
[34:27] crack Bitcoin we have a model that works
[34:29] and I mean if I show you slide some of
[34:32] the recent things they did I think
[34:34] really I cracked it you know it really
[34:36] behaves exactly like I'm saying it is
[34:38] behaving uh and not not just in the
[34:41] general Trend but you know even in all
[34:44] the different phases of a cycle but um
[34:48] you know it's this how you do science
[34:50] you come up with an hpo remember what I
[34:52] told you Kepler tried many different
[34:54] things before he found the right thing
[34:56] you know this is how you go like uh
[34:58] Edison you know he was trying literally
[35:01] thousand of different materials for his
[35:03] light light bulb for the filament and
[35:05] they were all failing until he found the
[35:08] right one you know tungen for example uh
[35:11] so he this how you do science you try
[35:13] you explore and it's beautiful that the
[35:15] Bitcoin is actually study because if you
[35:18] go online actually and you go on scholar
[35:20] you know where they have all the
[35:21] scholarly articles you find really
[35:24] hundreds of papers on bitcoin people are
[35:27] studying as a scientific topic maybe
[35:30] bitcoiners are not aware of it but
[35:32] actually they should it's actually there
[35:34] are serious scientists they study
[35:36] Bitcoin and in fact there are even Ser
[35:39] scientists they found power lws like I
[35:41] always mention all these these one of my
[35:44] favorite Financial physic is actually
[35:46] pretty famous his name is seret he's a
[35:49] French scientist and he actually
[35:52] published a couple of papers where it's
[35:54] all about power laws he he found
[35:57] actually one of the first Power laws
[35:58] that they found was a power law that I
[36:01] found four years before but at the end
[36:03] publish a paper instead I I was silly
[36:05] and I wrote on Reddit I should have
[36:08] publish a paper instead of spending my
[36:10] time on Reddit and and social media but
[36:12] you know this how we did it and they
[36:15] publish the paper because usually you
[36:16] know you cannot publish exactly the same
[36:19] thing that somebody else publish un you
[36:20] know unless you make an improvement or
[36:23] something but you know they didn't know
[36:25] about my work because you know it's on
[36:27] redit and so they don't read readit they
[36:28] are seror scientist they're not like me
[36:31] that I'm playing with kids and you know
[36:33] talking about it's it's fun it's fun and
[36:36] I like it it's also educational you know
[36:38] but it's okay but just to tell you right
[36:40] it's a scientific topic power loss came
[36:42] about with bcoin before serious
[36:45] scientist mention them but then mention
[36:47] this specific one that I'm mentioning
[36:49] that is time itself being a power law
[36:52] with price and uh um and so you know the
[36:57] beauty of doing something in time is
[36:59] that if you're right and your equation
[37:01] you basically you come up with an
[37:03] equation of how bcoin develops in time
[37:06] then I can plug in in that equation any
[37:08] future time right and so this how I can
[37:11] make a prediction I have an equation
[37:13] that b describe a Behavior now you have
[37:15] to understand what it means in this case
[37:17] for example we're looking at the medium
[37:19] price you know the kind of the average
[37:21] price of Bitcoin right we are not trying
[37:23] to predict exactly where it is day by
[37:25] day but in average where in average
[37:28] price is going and again remember with
[37:30] emphasis on scale we are not caring
[37:33] about you know is it 50,000 or 53,000
[37:37] you know to me is the same thing because
[37:39] remember I want to focus on how the
[37:42] price scales up right so is it 50,000 or
[37:45] 100,000 you know is 10
[37:48] or you know 50 is in between so okay so
[37:52] but you know it's much more precise than
[37:54] that but in general we are trying to
[37:56] understand how we go to the next level
[37:58] of 10 does it take five years does it
[38:00] take 10 years does it take 100 years you
[38:02] know that is this entire thing about
[38:04] power lws uh it's the focus on scale so
[38:08] you know there are many differen between
[38:09] s2f and the power law of course I
[38:12] believe the power laws are more powerful
[38:16] you know me and plan B are talking we
[38:18] want to do at a certain point like a
[38:19] public public debate you know where we
[38:22] discuss with Pro and cons I admire him
[38:25] and I think he's great I think he got
[38:27] too much negative publicity when his
[38:29] model didn't work because people got
[38:31] disappointed there was some controversy
[38:34] there I think he was at a certain point
[38:36] maybe got excited and he was kind of
[38:38] hyping you know what was going to happen
[38:41] you know because his model is very
[38:42] optimistic this is basically an
[38:45] exponential so every four years
[38:47] according to his model we go up by a
[38:49] factor of 10 and you know so this cycle
[38:52] for example s2f predicts basically we
[38:55] are going close to a million my
[38:57] prediction right because you were kind
[38:59] of asking what my model predicts is more
[39:02] like 210,000 for the cycle is much more
[39:06] sober is much more because you know
[39:09] there is growth but the one of the
[39:12] messages because there are a lot of
[39:13] messages associated with the power law
[39:15] is that it takes longer and longer for
[39:18] Bitcoin to grow you know most of the
[39:21] very fast growth happen in the beginning
[39:23] and now we are slowing down and
[39:25] everybody kind of kind of see that right
[39:27] because we don't see that explosive
[39:29] growth it's the same growth right
[39:31] strangely enough because but because has
[39:33] to do with size it to you know the
[39:35] analogy is this if he you know if it
[39:38] took let's say took a you know 100 days
[39:41] for Bitcoin to go from one to
[39:43] $10 next step to go from 10 you know to
[39:49] what did they say from1 to $100 right to
[39:51] go from 100 to a th000 so it's a next
[39:54] step of 10 it takes a proportional
[39:57] amount of time so instead of you know
[40:00] 100 days it's going to take a thousand
[40:02] days so you know we're talking about
[40:04] years right because thousands of days is
[40:07] kind of almost like three years right
[40:10] so this is idea that to go to the next
[40:14] step it takes longer and longer and
[40:16] longer so for example how long is going
[40:18] to take to reach a million well it's
[40:21] going to take
[40:23] 2033 that is what the calculation of a
[40:26] model says which you should reach 1
[40:28] million around 2033 now if you if you if
[40:32] s2f is right because this cycle actually
[40:36] we will see if SF is completely wrong
[40:40] because it look kind of wrong last cycle
[40:43] but this time this new cycle will really
[40:46] decide between all these models you know
[40:48] and again it's something that happen
[40:50] science as you get more data some of the
[40:52] old models die and is almost like a
[40:55] battle of the models you know so model
[40:57] gets put aside because we were're wrong
[40:59] that you know like the Earth being the
[41:01] center of the universe you know it
[41:03] turned out not to be true we went to the
[41:05] heliocentric model right so as you get
[41:09] more data more information and knowledge
[41:11] many different models can be excluded
[41:14] you know so I think this what will
[41:16] happen with this new Circle and s2f uh I
[41:20] think his model is wrong mostly because
[41:22] the exponential growth doesn't look like
[41:25] what is bitcoin is doing and also you
[41:27] know what again because all this is a
[41:29] philosophy power laws are associated
[41:32] with something that is stable that is
[41:34] strong that is antifragile you do it
[41:37] something to it he wants to go back to
[41:39] where he was before so I prefer to work
[41:41] that the coin really follows a power law
[41:44] because even if it takes longer for us
[41:47] to go you know to millions of dollars it
[41:50] shows that the system is robust is
[41:53] strong it's going to last for a long
[41:55] long time and things that move move
[41:57] exponential they don't they usually go
[42:00] fast fast fast and then they crash or
[42:03] something really dramatic happens to
[42:05] them so you know we will see because
[42:08] whatever bcoin does whatever bcoin does
[42:11] right I I cannot force it to do a
[42:13] certain thing but you know again I think
[42:16] the power law gives us a completely
[42:18] different perspective s2f is part you
[42:21] know and by the way I'm doing model much
[42:24] much earlier than uh Plan B I started is
[42:27] in 2012 all the way so you know it's not
[42:30] that I'm trying to copy what plan B is
[42:33] doing with something different you know
[42:34] I'm doing this much earlier than him but
[42:37] you know like I say I think there is so
[42:40] much more so much more interesting
[42:43] principle ideas and they are all
[42:46] consistent and all you know even this
[42:48] idea of time for example that we have to
[42:51] wait for good things to come right so
[42:53] you you read of a Bitcoin standard right
[42:56] at remember that there is concept of
[42:59] preference time time preference right
[43:02] and and there is idea that it's it's a
[43:05] good thing to wait you know for gains
[43:09] and for uh good things to happen right
[43:12] so I make a joke all the time that uh
[43:16] yeah it's actually for Bitcoin it's it's
[43:19] not preference time but preference log
[43:22] time right because I'm taking the log of
[43:24] time so it's kind of a joke but it makes
[43:26] you feel think about what is beyond that
[43:29] if you want really if you care about
[43:31] this system and we want to support the
[43:33] network and for us you know it's a tool
[43:36] for Freedom Etc we want it you know like
[43:39] a plant you know that is growing with
[43:41] its own patterns and it's going stronger
[43:44] and stronger you know instead of being
[43:47] selfish and want that Bitcoin goes up
[43:49] like an exponential and we make millions
[43:52] very quickly I rather hope that a
[43:56] Bitcoin it's like that key that waits
[43:58] for the cookies you know that uh is
[44:01] taking his time and say okay I'm I'm
[44:03] going to wait because now now I'm going
[44:04] to get two cookies instead of one right
[44:07] so you see how the philosophy changes we
[44:09] are almost like opposite in a way s2f
[44:12] and the power LW there are like two
[44:16] different models that say different
[44:17] things you know all opposite things yeah
[44:22] I like uh your approach to it because it
[44:25] seems like an uh and connected to
[44:28] Something Real it seems like low time
[44:31] preference it seems like not a hype
[44:33] model where you like predict oh at this
[44:36] state uh the price will be at 1 million
[44:39] it's like uh no we having a power low
[44:43] and this is what it seems like and you
[44:45] also mentioned it in the beginning
[44:47] somewhere that uh there can be
[44:50] exceptions like for example I don't know
[44:52] uh in uh in the in the co area actually
[44:56] happened in Germany where the the
[44:59] company who buil who was uh doing the
[45:02] manufacturing of the covid vaccines H he
[45:05] that was in a smaller uh town and they
[45:09] now bringing in so many taxes because of
[45:12] one event like probably this is
[45:14] something it's a little bit of an
[45:15] exception to like something like a power
[45:18] but as Bitcoin also grows it seems like
[45:22] uh exceptions to the power law can be
[45:25] happen uh um not as as as as fast like
[45:30] the more Bitcoin grows the harder it
[45:33] gets for it to to break like you know
[45:36] like exactly exactly exactly you start
[45:40] see you you started to be a fellow
[45:42] physicist you're starting think like a
[45:44] physicist you know this is good this
[45:46] this is this why you know I wish
[45:48] everybody study Physics you know they
[45:50] should it's the martial I call it
[45:52] sometime the martial art of science you
[45:54] know it really trains you we have even
[45:57] experiment they show that when students
[45:59] take physics classes their brain changes
[46:01] because it's so different from thinking
[46:03] from everything else you start to see
[46:05] pattern you started to reason in a very
[46:08] systematic way you know you say okay
[46:11] yeah great like you did right now you
[46:13] say yeah a system is bigger and I'm
[46:15] talking about some kind of feedback loop
[46:18] of action reaction of course it's going
[46:20] to go slower because it takes much more
[46:23] to go from you know 100,000 to a million
[46:26] you know
[46:27] uh and also exceptions will not be so
[46:32] important you know very be little uh
[46:35] there be some reaction but it will not
[46:37] be as dramatic as before you know and we
[46:40] see that we seen so many things even
[46:42] these bubbles you know these times when
[46:45] after the alving the price goes away
[46:48] actually from the power law it's a i i
[46:52] that again I try to be consistent with
[46:54] My Philosophy I see it almost what
[46:57] physic is called like a perturbation you
[46:59] know it's like a you have a you know
[47:02] like a a branch of a tree but you know
[47:04] stays there it's stable and then I go
[47:07] and hit it and what it does it starts to
[47:09] vibrate right and then little by little
[47:12] because of the frictions inside the tree
[47:15] and you know the fibers inside the tree
[47:17] they create friction it loses that
[47:20] amplitude and he goes back to where he
[47:23] was
[47:24] before and so that is exactly what what
[47:27] happened with the coin because if you
[47:28] see what happens with the bubble I can
[47:30] show you again in one of the graphs you
[47:32] see the response to the alving the price
[47:35] goes up like crazy and then he reaches
[47:38] the top and he goes back and you know
[47:39] where he goes exactly along the
[47:42] trajectory of a power law it goes back
[47:44] there how does he do it I don't know but
[47:47] it does it you know it's a fact it's
[47:49] there in the graph you know it's a
[47:51] scientific thing and it shows that the
[47:54] system is robust it's yes it can react
[47:56] react to changes but even goes back to
[48:00] equilibrium same thing with physiology
[48:02] if I run my heartbeat will go up you
[48:05] know it it's kind of a perturbation in
[48:07] the system then because what is called M
[48:11] homeostasis you know the system wants to
[48:13] go back to equilibrium you see again
[48:16] this understanding of Bitcoin as a power
[48:19] law also allows you to understand how
[48:21] the Cycles work it's all consistent it's
[48:24] all part of the story and it's not
[48:27] you know it's not like a little BS story
[48:30] you know that I'm making up it's all
[48:32] Based on data it's all based on science
[48:34] it's all based on now could could I be
[48:37] wrong yes because some of these things
[48:38] that maybe I see maybe are not here you
[48:41] know but this we have a tool now to go
[48:44] and answer this question in a more
[48:46] scientific way you know and and and
[48:49] understanding Bitcoin as this kind of
[48:51] process that follows a power law so yeah
[48:54] and uh can that happen in the future be
[48:57] it could happen you know maybe there is
[48:58] some dis disastrous event you know
[49:01] like and sorry if I kind of skip a
[49:04] question you were talking about
[49:06] different currencies you know so what
[49:08] happened I didn't do it yet because I'm
[49:11] doing so many things I'm coming up with
[49:12] some many I spend all actually almost
[49:15] all my day doing these graphs because it
[49:18] doesn't look like it takes time but it
[49:20] does you have to code you have to
[49:22] understand you have to adjust the graph
[49:24] you know to make it nicer to make it
[49:26] look more understandable for people so
[49:28] it takes a long time for me to work on
[49:31] this is I'm I'm very excited I cannot
[49:34] wait to wake up and and work and see how
[49:37] people like it and how they respond it's
[49:40] really interesting uh it's it's the love
[49:43] of my life right now you know but um
[49:46] um you know I didn't do the currencies
[49:48] because there were other things the
[49:50] dollar is really good a good way because
[49:54] we're talking about value most people in
[49:56] the word use still the dollar as a
[49:58] currency you know it's very stable
[50:00] inflation inflation It's relatively
[50:03] small uh it would be interesting to see
[50:06] how it behaves with different currency
[50:08] but it's really I don't know what we
[50:11] could learn from that you know besides
[50:13] okay this currency crazy and uh you know
[50:16] maybe the power load is not there
[50:17] anymore when uh you have a i a very
[50:20] inflationary currency I I will do it
[50:23] because it's interesting and it should
[50:24] be done but I I don't know yet I saw
[50:27] some graphs with other people show of
[50:30] how crazy looks like looks almost
[50:32] exponential but see at that point it's
[50:35] not power law anymore I mean it's not
[50:37] Bitcoin anymore it's really the currency
[50:40] that is losing value in almost
[50:42] exponential fashion so that effect
[50:45] dominates over the growth of Bitcoin
[50:47] itself it it looks like Bitcoin is
[50:49] growing but really is a currency that is
[50:51] losing value you know uh that is what
[50:54] bcoin does you know the makes you your
[50:57] stupid currency look like crazy if uh if
[51:00] if you trade it in Bitcoin right but uh
[51:04] I don't know if there is really a
[51:05] pattern there we we can look at it but I
[51:08] my guess is that it's dominated by the
[51:11] currency losing value you know with with
[51:13] dollar it's a small correction in fact
[51:16] the other day posst because I say this
[51:18] many times it's small correction small
[51:19] correction but uh I really didn't show a
[51:22] graph and then finally I show a graph
[51:24] and you can see from that graph in my uh
[51:26] Reddit post that uh it basically almost
[51:30] didn't change at all you know while if
[51:32] you do the same thing with the sp500 for
[51:35] example in a equivalent amount of time
[51:39] he lost almost half of his value so it's
[51:41] already not much because you know like
[51:43] in the last you know almost like 20
[51:46] years SP 500 went up like four times you
[51:49] know and it seem oh maybe it's a big
[51:51] well it's not nothing for Bitcoin
[51:54] because Bitcoin goes up a factor of four
[51:56] in sometime in few months you know um
[52:00] but um you know for a for a normal
[52:04] investment seems a lot but you have to
[52:07] cut it in half because you lost half of
[52:09] it by for because of inflation you know
[52:12] so it's really dominant with things like
[52:15] SP 500 almost like you're basically
[52:18] catching up with inflation you're not
[52:19] really making a ton of money you are
[52:22] like basically preserving your money
[52:24] against inflation that is not what
[52:27] investment should be about right it
[52:28] should not just be about uh holding
[52:31] something because uh you beat inflation
[52:33] but you know to create wealth because
[52:36] basically you're saving and you're not
[52:39] doing all the things you would like to
[52:41] do with the money because you want to
[52:43] the Future reward but if a future reward
[52:45] is hey I just uh fought inflation you
[52:48] know it's really sad and it tells
[52:52] everything right in our philosophy of
[52:54] Bitcoin that we are against printing
[52:56] money and we all the time complain about
[52:59] inflation Etc these things that keeps us
[53:01] like slaves you look at that graph it I
[53:04] just posted you see it directly with
[53:06] your eyes look at this you know I
[53:08] invested in Sp 500 it's supposed to be
[53:10] this incredible investment for 20 years
[53:14] and I barely beat inflation by a little
[53:16] bit you know while Bitcoin you you are
[53:19] plotting the same graph Bitcoin bitco
[53:20] looks like this you know like really
[53:24] thousand tens of thousands B better than
[53:26] sp5 R better than gold better than
[53:29] anything it looks like like you look at
[53:31] the graph you say what re is happening
[53:33] yet doesn't even look real you know it's
[53:36] crazy I'm super excited to announce that
[53:39] this podcast got the first ever sponsor
[53:43] 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one
[53:47] and they teach and preach self custody
[53:49] this is my go to exchange when someone
[53:52] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[53:55] from this is the EAS easiest entry for
[53:58] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[54:00] Plus at the same time support this
[54:03] podcast use code Robin and click the
[54:05] link in the description maybe it's now a
[54:07] good time to actually look at the cfts
[54:09] you you mentioned in the while we we
[54:12] talked and now answer like the all the
[54:14] questions like how is the graph coming
[54:17] along what's the power of of the Bitcoin
[54:19] power law yeah and and where we are
[54:22] going and maybe we can also see like
[54:24] okay when should we cross the you said
[54:27] 210,000 for this cycle so like 210,000
[54:30] in like the next one two years yes and
[54:33] they can you see my screen I can see the
[54:35] screen yes bit boy side
[54:38] on yeah this is actually my company so I
[54:42] have a company and a goal of a company
[54:44] and so let me see if I can actually make
[54:46] it as a
[54:48] presentation let slides show so I should
[54:50] click here on the power L power L on the
[54:55] PowerPoint so fixated with power
[54:58] lws uh okay from the beginning all right
[55:01] and and now you see it as um
[55:03] presentation I see the slides yeah yeah
[55:05] so my my site is called B posidon and
[55:09] you guys can go there and sign up we
[55:12] have a like a little box where you can
[55:14] put your email we're going to we are
[55:16] planning to send regular uh newsletters
[55:20] uh you know to update people you know so
[55:22] you you can actually see it at your own
[55:24] liser instead of you know following me
[55:27] also on Twitter this is my Twitter by
[55:29] the way I I know if this is a crazy name
[55:32] I didn't know that you actually could
[55:34] use uh your own uh tailor the name and
[55:38] because so many different places Now
[55:41] link to this uh you know different
[55:43] interviews that I did Etc I decided not
[55:47] to change it at least for now uh so you
[55:50] know just paste and copy and or you know
[55:53] I know it's long but come and and uh see
[55:56] our discussions on Twitter and this site
[55:59] what this site is about uh we are
[56:02] developing an app actually because uh we
[56:04] want to help investors uh and the app
[56:08] will you know you basically decide what
[56:10] is your style if you're odler because
[56:13] this approach can also be used by odler
[56:15] because basically it's telling you look
[56:17] this is a good time to do DCA uh do it
[56:20] very aggressively because the price is
[56:22] very low we are um oversold relative to
[56:26] this General Trend here is not such a
[56:29] good idea you know just wait a little
[56:31] bit until you get actually a lower price
[56:34] you know so even a old can use or if you
[56:37] want to be aggressive where maybe you
[56:39] want to multiply your Bitcoin and you
[56:41] want to risk where you want to sell
[56:42] maybe 10% of your Bitcoin 20% 50% you
[56:47] know is is something that is called
[56:49] rebalancing right you sell the asset
[56:52] that is doing very well you know to get
[56:54] the one that is not doing and then
[56:56] because of a cycle you can Reby Bitcoin
[56:58] at a lower price so this app is going to
[57:00] help you with that you decide how you
[57:02] want to play the game and then uh it's
[57:05] basically doing the buy and selling for
[57:07] you all automated of course you can
[57:10] check what it's doing the performance
[57:12] you can control it but uh many people
[57:14] you know have busy lives so they don't
[57:16] want to look at a chart all day long so
[57:19] this this app can do it for you
[57:21] automatically uh so sign up we are going
[57:23] to do a beta testing very very soon so
[57:27] you know uh you can be part of the beta
[57:29] testing if we set up and so this is the
[57:33] first graph I wanted to show you so
[57:34] basically this is what I say all the
[57:35] time this basically what they show on on
[57:39] you know CNBC and all these uh Financial
[57:44] uh media uh they always talk about how
[57:47] Bitcoin went up like crazy and then it
[57:49] crash and it looks messy you know like
[57:52] if you look at this graph it doesn't
[57:53] look very is a pattern at all right it
[57:55] look looks like yeah maybe it's
[57:57] generally going up you know we have this
[58:01] going up recently right in the last year
[58:04] but you know if you for example if we
[58:06] just went through a bare Market it looks
[58:08] sad right oh we reached 60,000 now we
[58:10] crash to 16 and you know it's the hand
[58:14] of Bitcoin it's horrible you know uh
[58:17] this what we usually show you know uh
[58:19] they I never show them saw them showing
[58:22] a log graph for example where a so in
[58:25] this chart what you see in this chart is
[58:27] is called a linear chart because the
[58:29] time in this case what I'm showing are
[58:32] the days how many days are passed by
[58:34] since the creation of Bitcoin so the
[58:36] what we call the Genesis block this why
[58:39] we have zero you know of a Genesis block
[58:42] when Bitcoin was created then uh you
[58:45] know these are the number of days from
[58:47] that event right uh and and basically
[58:51] here is where we are today um I think at
[58:54] this this charts like three or four days
[58:56] ago and here on the Y AIS we see the
[58:59] price I know it's in this scientific
[59:00] notation that some people are not
[59:02] familiar but you know we're talking
[59:03] about every Mark here is basically
[59:06] 10,000 right so we have on top 70,000
[59:09] 60,000 and so on because 10 to4 here
[59:13] means
[59:14] 10,000 um and uh and then you know if
[59:18] you do this chart with many people are
[59:20] familiar because it looks kind of like
[59:22] you know that rainbow chart that
[59:23] everybody's familiar the rainbow chart
[59:26] actually is based on the work of this
[59:28] guy that is called troll or law I would
[59:31] like to meet him one day somewhere in
[59:34] the Bitcoin Universe because he you know
[59:37] I don't think he he understood
[59:40] completely what he was dealing with
[59:41] because he doesn't use the word power
[59:44] law uh it comes up with a a method that
[59:48] is a little bit cumbersome but his big
[59:51] intuition was I think we should plot
[59:54] Bitcoin but is not you know a big big
[59:56] deal because whenever you have something
[59:58] that changes by you know factor of 10
[60:01] like it happened with Bitcoin and
[60:02] remember he did it this around 2014 so
[60:05] we were here you know when we didn't
[60:07] have a lot of data uh and he decided to
[60:12] plot the graph on a what is called a log
[60:15] linear so log in the y axis but still
[60:18] linear in the y axis sorry the x-axis
[60:21] you know the time is linear it is what
[60:23] most people are familiar with and so so
[60:26] when you do that even at that time it
[60:28] looked like there was some kind of a
[60:30] pattern and and he was trying to say to
[60:34] people I think I see here something you
[60:37] know it looks like and that was one of
[60:40] the things I was trying to describe had
[60:42] a very very good intuition so even if he
[60:44] didn't have a language of a physicist
[60:46] that you know to call it a power law uh
[60:50] he understood that scaling was important
[60:53] so and he and the scaling was the X Y
[60:57] AIS it was focus on how Bitcoin changes
[61:00] in the y axis and you say look you know
[61:03] when I go from zero to
[61:05] $1 and so you see here is log so what
[61:09] this means you know when it's a log zero
[61:13] we are talking about $1 because 10 to Z
[61:16] is $1 10 to one is $10 10 to the two uh
[61:20] $100 ,000 and so on right this this what
[61:23] these numbers represent uh is the
[61:26] exponent of these dollar prices so he
[61:29] you know when he did it in that way he
[61:32] he he started to say this see guys I'm
[61:35] looking at how long it takes for Bitcoin
[61:37] to go from you know from zero to $1 to
[61:42] you know from from $1 to $10 from $10
[61:45] from $100 and so on and it looks like
[61:48] it's taking longer and longer time you
[61:51] had a very beautiful graph with all the
[61:53] time that it took to do that and you
[61:55] also projected in the future because he
[61:57] wanted to see what happened in the
[61:59] future so he he is kind of a grandfather
[62:02] of this idea right so because this also
[62:05] how you do science it's not a question
[62:06] oh I was the first you were the second
[62:09] many people come together and everybody
[62:11] has their own little contribution right
[62:13] this how many scientific Fields develop
[62:16] was you know Kepler and then Newton and
[62:18] then you know and Galileo have started
[62:21] you know they all contributed something
[62:24] for science to move along so think with
[62:26] the history of Bitcoin people started to
[62:28] notice there were very precise
[62:30] regularities right I was also active at
[62:33] that time in this field I was making my
[62:35] own charted I was already talking about
[62:37] power lows but I was more focused I I I
[62:40] cared about the price but I was also my
[62:43] the power lws that I was Finding were
[62:45] with addresses with Ash rate with
[62:48] transition I didn't look at of the price
[62:51] directly if a price directly was a power
[62:53] law because I thought it was like kind
[62:55] of two step process first you find the
[62:57] power law let's say between addresses
[62:59] and price and then if you know how
[63:02] addresses change you can then do the
[63:05] second step and say our price change
[63:07] right so it was like a two-step process
[63:10] uh and so I was like working there I
[63:13] heard about Trololo model he was fitting
[63:17] a nonlinear fit because you see this is
[63:19] Al the other thing that he saw remember
[63:22] he was for here around
[63:24] 2014 it doesn't look very curved right
[63:27] if you just focus up to 2014 it looks it
[63:31] kind of looks almost like a straight
[63:32] line and the straight line in this type
[63:34] of graph is what is called an
[63:37] exponential so many people were saying
[63:39] that Bitcoin was an exponential and if
[63:41] it was an exponential imagine I draw a
[63:43] straight line just here from you know
[63:45] the beginning to 2014 and I continue
[63:48] that straight line you know it will be
[63:50] already a million several years ago but
[63:53] he didn't do that right so he was right
[63:56] in his intuition because when oh
[63:58] actually the ma because he applied uh
[64:02] what is called a regression basically
[64:04] it's a mathematical tool to find is
[64:07] there like basically his answering this
[64:09] question is there some kind of a curve
[64:10] there that seems to explain the behavior
[64:13] of Bitcoin and he came up with a log
[64:17] that the answer was a log that the log
[64:19] of
[64:21] price seem to change with the log of
[64:24] time and
[64:26] I was kind of silly because if I I saw
[64:28] that and I should immediately have
[64:30] recognized but okay basically you found
[64:32] the power law that this is a cumbersome
[64:35] way of finding a power law because there
[64:38] is a much more straight way and what I
[64:40] want to say one more think about this
[64:42] chart you see even the nonexperienced
[64:46] mathematician of physicist looks at this
[64:49] chart and all of a sudden it doesn't
[64:51] look that random anymore right it
[64:53] follows a very nice beautiful art
[64:56] it seems to go up right maybe slowing
[64:58] down right because it's curved it's not
[65:02] straight if it was an exponential
[65:03] remember it will look like a straight
[65:04] line in this kind of Graph the linear
[65:08] graph an exponential looks like a hockey
[65:10] stick it goes very very fast but a in a
[65:13] graph like this looks a straight line
[65:15] this is not a power this is not a an
[65:17] exponential so it looks curved so at we
[65:19] means is growing but it's growing slower
[65:23] than an exponential right and it's now
[65:26] stoping because this thing in theory you
[65:28] know it's like a parabola it's a very
[65:30] because uh remember I told you that we
[65:33] can extract the exponents when we do
[65:36] this calculation and the exponent for
[65:37] Bitcoin is 5.82 so it looks basically
[65:40] like a a parabola right because we know
[65:42] what a parabola looks like y equal s
[65:45] square but instead of having the square
[65:47] we are having a number that is almost
[65:49] close to Six so you can imagine how fast
[65:51] it's going so when we're talking about
[65:52] slowing down it's still a very fast
[65:55] process is slowing down relatively to an
[65:58] exponential uh but so I was telling you
[66:01] there is a much more St and this look
[66:03] this stars are the alings right so we
[66:05] can see some other regularities in this
[66:07] chart like every time there is an alving
[66:10] it seems there is a like some kind of
[66:12] event where you know we call them bubble
[66:14] the price goes up shoots up reaches a
[66:17] top and then it comes down right but you
[66:19] see how nicely because differently from
[66:23] trolol and Etc this chart is also based
[66:25] on the power law because I did one step
[66:28] that I will show you in a moment and
[66:30] then everything looks much more regular
[66:32] when you do that see uh so even in this
[66:35] chart you can start to see that it
[66:37] doesn't look that random and people were
[66:39] already pointed out but you know they
[66:42] didn't really love the language of a
[66:44] power LW because to me that is how
[66:47] things start to be so clear first of all
[66:50] and then it's not anymore fitting a line
[66:54] it's an entire philosophy
[66:56] of Bitcoin and in fact life so and that
[66:58] is here look this is revealed by this
[67:02] graph so for a moment forget about the
[67:05] oscillations here because this is what I
[67:07] added on top say Okay beside doing this
[67:10] is also oscillating but so if you forget
[67:13] about the oscillations you can see that
[67:15] something magical happened look St curve
[67:19] straight line right it looks like a
[67:22] straight line and you say well there are
[67:24] these deviation yeah yeah a straight
[67:26] line with some deviations where like I
[67:29] told you before look what happened here
[67:31] it deviates it goes up then what after
[67:34] and how does Bitcoin knows to do that it
[67:36] comes back and look what it does it
[67:38] follows the power LW it follows the
[67:40] bottom you know it it is parallel to the
[67:43] trend and it stays within this channel
[67:46] that is like a deviation from that
[67:48] General Trend the general trend is the
[67:50] orange line so that is kind of a middle
[67:53] ground and then you have this Reg is
[67:56] like oh it looks like a it goes down to
[67:58] some kind of a deviation like a very
[68:00] fixed deviation it turns out it's about
[68:03] 60% from the trend and then it stays
[68:06] there and so I did it also before you
[68:08] see and here and here a little bit you
[68:10] know this actually by ways Co that is a
[68:13] little deeper but you see you know um in
[68:16] this um in in in the cycle after this is
[68:21] like a this is the last cycle this is
[68:23] the previous one like in 2018 then then
[68:26] we had the covid and during the covid
[68:29] the price went back you know to that
[68:32] General bottom Trend right but it stayed
[68:35] a little bit above right but I don't
[68:37] know maybe where where things right
[68:39] these are some of the there are
[68:40] regularities and then there are like
[68:42] little exceptions but in general again
[68:44] you know the general pattern is follow
[68:46] and this see after the last Cycles again
[68:49] we see the same thing where price stays
[68:51] there in this green band right that
[68:54] represents like a a range of different
[68:57] percentages from the general Trend right
[69:00] in the legend you can see 20% 40% and so
[69:03] on so all of a sudden when I saw these
[69:07] with my training of
[69:09] plotting power Lads and some of them
[69:11] believe me are not perfect like the
[69:13] planet they look ugly like if you do for
[69:16] example with addresses it looks much
[69:18] more disorderly right but there is still
[69:21] a general Trend there where you can say
[69:24] look it looks it doesn't look completely
[69:26] random it follows a precise pattern it's
[69:29] a power law and uh and then you know you
[69:31] can actually do this calculation that is
[69:34] a regression that uh is finding a
[69:36] straight line and and many people say Al
[69:38] you did a regression what is a big deal
[69:40] is not a big deal because most people
[69:42] that have like some basic mathematics
[69:44] skills know how to do regression and the
[69:46] computer can do for you the point
[69:49] is recognizing that there is something
[69:53] very organized very structure that is
[69:57] very unlikely for a an asset to behave
[70:00] in this way and in particular the other
[70:02] thing that I always remind to the
[70:04] critics of oh you just did a straight
[70:07] line in a graph it is silly you are
[70:10] silly if you say that because look at
[70:12] this you know my Italian passion comes
[70:14] out we went through orders of magnitude
[70:17] the this thing went from being F cents
[70:19] all the way to almost 100,000 and
[70:22] through all these he beh in this regular
[70:25] fashion
[70:26] this cannot happen by chance okay no
[70:29] scientist will tell will look at these
[70:31] and tell you this happens by chance in
[70:34] fact you know this uh Krueger um person
[70:38] you know he's like one of the um very
[70:41] active Bitcoin uh accounts and from what
[70:45] I understand I like his post Etc is very
[70:49] smart guy he has a a PhD from Stanford
[70:52] in mat you look at this graph I don't
[70:54] know why he didn't find it before but he
[70:56] look at the graph and he commented this
[70:58] is amazing Bitcoin goes through an
[71:01] Unstoppable power law he understood it
[71:04] anybody with any basic understanding of
[71:07] math and physics and some a little
[71:11] in understanding of Science and
[71:14] intelligence immediately says this is
[71:17] this is interesting this is weird and if
[71:20] you do it with other assets they don't
[71:22] look like that SP 500 doesn't look like
[71:24] that gold doesn't look like that you
[71:27] know just be coin and so it you know
[71:30] when I discover this yeah it's not
[71:33] something completely new there was TR
[71:35] there were other people but the new
[71:37] thing was this is a power law and
[71:39] everything changes all of a sudden
[71:40] because now you have all these other
[71:43] tools that come together in trying to
[71:46] interpret what Bitcoin does that we
[71:48] already discuss right and so uh you know
[71:51] this was an example that I was telling
[71:53] you before this is a paper where a see
[71:55] this a lot of we got also and a certain
[71:58] point we were all you know when actually
[72:01] s2f came about they were all these
[72:04] economies coming out some of you know
[72:06] probably students or maybe some phds Etc
[72:10] they were debating about the validity of
[72:13] v2f but also because uh there was like a
[72:17] u this uh soft you know I think he's a
[72:21] um computer scientist uh came out very
[72:26] very clever guy he saw my paper not my
[72:28] paper my my Reddit post because that was
[72:31] my mistake to publish he saw my uh my
[72:35] post and he also he like being a smart
[72:38] guy immediately was convinced this is
[72:41] striking and he started to post a bunch
[72:44] of medium articles his name is HC burger
[72:48] and he popularized this model you know
[72:50] and it
[72:51] becames not as famous as s2f but it
[72:54] becames kind of almost the competition
[72:56] and people were putting it down like
[72:57] these economies we attacking it and some
[73:00] of them started to make us fun of us but
[73:02] we're taking the log of time because you
[73:04] see how weird it looks all these dates
[73:06] bunching up what these dates bunching up
[73:09] means is because we are taking the log
[73:11] of time it it takes longer and longer
[73:13] and longer time for the price to go up
[73:16] by a factor of 10 this what it means you
[73:19] have to understand what is going on and
[73:21] come up with the right interpretation
[73:23] but because this Economist are not used
[73:26] to take the log of time of an asset they
[73:29] got confused and one in one of them in
[73:31] particular was telling us is absurd you
[73:33] know it doesn't make any sense it means
[73:35] that time is accelerating it doesn't
[73:37] mean that time is accelerating it's
[73:39] simply a way of showing that if you
[73:41] focus on scale both the price and the
[73:46] time scale in a similar fashion in a
[73:49] very we call it in physics we use this
[73:52] term a scale invariant invariant means
[73:55] it doesn't change so if I go from 10 to
[73:58] 100 to th it does the same thing because
[74:01] a straight line means a regular a
[74:04] consistent pace of change right so the
[74:08] same thing here so you can understand
[74:09] what is happening here in this graph
[74:11] they have time oh look at the these
[74:14] weird guys you know these weirdos that
[74:16] are taking the log of time we do it all
[74:18] the time in science I don't know why
[74:20] economists don't know that so it took
[74:23] the time that it takes for the to to
[74:25] grow right in this case years and and
[74:27] why this is a log graph you see how the
[74:30] weird scaling first of all all this you
[74:32] know they are not equally space that is
[74:34] a sign we're looking at the log and also
[74:37] you see how it grows by factor of 10
[74:39] right 10 50 and so on and same thing in
[74:42] in the x-axis so when you do something
[74:45] like that that is the main tool one of
[74:47] the main tool it's a trick if that is
[74:50] another thing people that don't
[74:52] understand M you know I see on the
[74:54] social media they say
[74:56] he manipulated the
[74:58] chart I mean it's silly but at the same
[75:01] time because we are dealing with a lot
[75:02] of people that don't know M it makes me
[75:04] sad if they say things like it what
[75:06] which kind of manipulator it's called a
[75:08] transformation we do this all the time
[75:10] in physics to show patterns that we not
[75:13] visible when you have a normal type of
[75:16] graph the fact that this Behavior looks
[75:20] like a straight line and a log log graph
[75:22] is significant it means that is a power
[75:24] l it's one of the way to recognize it
[75:27] easily because our eyes are trained to
[75:30] look for a straight line it doesn't mean
[75:32] that you're just basing all your
[75:35] understanding on using your eyes you
[75:37] then first use your intuition you look
[75:40] where is a straight line it looks like a
[75:41] straight line yes a little bit tilted
[75:43] you know maybe in the beginning but you
[75:45] know it really follows kind of like a
[75:48] straight line so it can be irregular it
[75:50] doesn't have to be always perfect but
[75:53] the scientist say it's a look like a
[75:55] power law yeah with some deviations of
[75:57] course because you I still kind of a
[75:59] random process but it's significant
[76:02] because when I can come up with all kind
[76:04] of interesting Properties by looking at
[76:07] exponent you know there are ways of
[76:09] thinking and understanding you know I
[76:11] can see the different animals have
[76:14] different lines so you know this animal
[76:17] uh the tooth grows faster why what is
[76:19] going on in that animal why that happens
[76:22] you know there are so many things that
[76:23] you can understand and extrapolate by
[76:26] doing this trick now we do it all the
[76:29] time it's like part of doing science
[76:32] okay so this is very interesting and
[76:34] these are an example but look at this
[76:36] there are tons of other example all over
[76:39] the place where are these are are you
[76:41] know for example I have body mass right
[76:43] and here are a metabolic rate and so I
[76:46] was telling you before right let me try
[76:48] to summarize what I wasling in the post
[76:52] the beauty of this graph right first of
[76:54] all look at all these different animals
[76:57] in this graph where they all follow how
[76:59] the bull knows you know where the goose
[77:02] is going to be of the dog and I all
[77:05] organized even the man and the woman the
[77:07] woman look at the woman so and there are
[77:11] many things to learn from a graph like
[77:13] this like for example right Al besides
[77:15] saying oh it's a it's a power law you
[77:17] can say why a woman is just below the
[77:21] man right well it seems a man for
[77:23] example the you know given the same body
[77:26] mass if you take a woman and a man with
[77:28] the same body mass in average men
[77:31] consume more energy so actually women
[77:34] are more efficient right so women are
[77:36] more efficient in now using the energy
[77:38] maybe because when they became pregnant
[77:40] they have to save energy so or maybe men
[77:43] need to do like a big efforts you know
[77:45] to anunt Etc so in evolution we change a
[77:49] little bit like when I say men and women
[77:51] are the same no because this graph shows
[77:52] you that at least from a metabolic point
[77:55] of view we're not you know there is a
[77:56] difference and an important difference
[77:59] and you can actually start to understand
[78:01] a lot of things by just looking at the
[78:02] graph the other thing I was explaining
[78:05] is that the slope this is why the slope
[78:07] is so important is three quter that
[78:10] means that is less than one and what
[78:13] that is the consequence of that well
[78:15] that means that every time I make the
[78:18] animal bigger and bigger so you know you
[78:21] will think I'm making the animal two
[78:24] times bigger is going to consume two
[78:26] times the energy no because it's the
[78:28] size of an animal this this graph means
[78:31] simply that how much energy you're
[78:33] consuming is your mass to the power of
[78:37] 3/4 right so if I take two to the
[78:40] 3/4 it's I don't remember exactly by by
[78:44] heart but something like 1.6 so it's not
[78:47] quite two so that means there is some
[78:50] kind of economy of scales right so if I
[78:53] triple the animal is not going to be
[78:56] three times energy it's going to be 2.
[78:59] three let's say I I cannot do that in my
[79:02] head but if you do it with the
[79:03] calculator take the power of you know
[79:05] three to the power of 3/4s you don't get
[79:09] three you get something less and Tre
[79:11] that means as the animal scales up
[79:14] becomes bigger and bigger and bigger
[79:17] it's more efficient in using V Energy do
[79:19] you see how many things we can learn
[79:21] from a power law this why you see why
[79:23] scientists are fascinated by them
[79:25] because just by deriving that little
[79:27] power we can say so many things about
[79:29] the phenomena that we're studying and
[79:31] also looking at the details of a chart
[79:33] and so on and so on so on then we can
[79:35] think about okay what is causing this
[79:37] why we see this three quter why is not
[79:40] five7 you know what is going on let's
[79:42] try to study and understand how that
[79:45] number comes about and so on you see it
[79:47] happens everywhere in languages like
[79:49] look how languages organized this is a
[79:52] how many times a word appears a language
[79:55] all the like what Latin and Japanese
[79:58] have anything to do with each other well
[80:00] they follow power law and every language
[80:03] see these are different colors represent
[80:05] different languages but yeah there will
[80:07] be differences but they all kind of stay
[80:09] on top of each other they seem to follow
[80:11] a very precise pattern same thing with
[80:13] cities you see here I show cities
[80:16] different nations right and different
[80:18] cities the different lines here
[80:20] represented a different city so it
[80:22] depends on how big the city and how it
[80:24] waves Etc and so there are very precise
[80:28] quantities whatever I'm looking at it
[80:30] could be how the city is growing and
[80:33] whatever these different type of
[80:35] parameters like I say it works with
[80:38] number of jobs uh gas
[80:40] stations um you know whatever t
[80:44] television stations and in a city they
[80:47] all follow power losss power losss power
[80:50] losss and the planets that we mention
[80:52] right and these are just few example
[80:54] that are l under and look right when you
[80:56] compare it with everything look again
[80:59] Bitcoin it follows like a general Trend
[81:02] looks a straight line so Bitcoin is also
[81:05] power law and it follows within all
[81:07] these thingss you know it's incredible
[81:09] it's like if this is true and it
[81:12] continues to be true it's probably one
[81:14] of the most fundamental interesting
[81:16] things about Bitcoin but for the first
[81:18] time in human history we have an asset
[81:22] that doesn't behave like a a a a
[81:25] um an asset random and it goes up it
[81:27] goes down Etc it does locally but the
[81:31] general Trend over many many many orders
[81:33] of magnitude like you know basically
[81:35] going from being a mouse all the way to
[81:37] being an elephant it follows the general
[81:41] power LW pattern it's extraordinary and
[81:44] if you are not seeing this I'm sorry for
[81:46] you I'm very sorry for you you are not
[81:48] you don't like science you don't
[81:50] understand science and I you
[81:53] know it's sad because it's a beautiful
[81:55] thing you know understanding all these
[81:58] with there are patterns in life and and
[82:00] in Bitcoin you know so uh and then you
[82:04] know this is what I was telling you
[82:05] before other scientists you know they
[82:08] again sometime they criticize me even to
[82:10] last the other day there is this this
[82:13] Reddit post that I don't know you know
[82:15] has to be like the saddest place on the
[82:17] Internet is called bcoin right Buu TT
[82:21] coin because these people are I'm sorry
[82:24] to us reward but literally idiots
[82:26] because you know when he was they were I
[82:28] was talking to them in 2012 when Bitcoin
[82:31] was $9 and you know you could still
[82:34] think he was a tulip Etc but you know 15
[82:37] years later they say the same thing is a
[82:39] tulip Etc so you're really an idiot
[82:41] because it's not right and right now if
[82:44] you invested in Bitcoin instead of being
[82:46] stupid on the internet you could be a
[82:48] millionaire because you know it went up
[82:49] thousands of time but you know these
[82:51] people continue to say s bu then they
[82:53] were making fun of my model and I was
[82:56] telling them look you know go and make
[82:57] fun of uh the snet that is one of the
[83:00] most famous physicist in the world uh
[83:03] you know in the financial uh area of
[83:06] physics and he wrote entire books on how
[83:09] to predict crashes in the stock market
[83:12] this guy is famous if you if you are in
[83:14] the field and he they wrote a paper with
[83:17] a coh where they were they had power lws
[83:21] in Bitcoin you know so you're saying
[83:23] that I'm silly to make little regression
[83:25] lines well that is exactly what we did
[83:27] we took the market cap we took the AC
[83:30] users by the way I had a graph I that on
[83:33] Reddit for years before them and this
[83:36] why you know they were not aware of my
[83:38] work because I publish on Reddit instead
[83:39] of a paper but I did it four years
[83:41] before that and I show this like see I
[83:43] told you that the data look messy you
[83:46] know because of course there is some
[83:48] Randomness right but in general you can
[83:50] see there is a very general pattern that
[83:53] can be explained by a power law these
[83:55] guys do a regression in a log l graph
[83:58] you can make fun of them they publish a
[84:00] paper you didn't you know these are
[84:02] professional scientist you are not you
[84:04] know so maybe maybe they are right you
[84:06] know so and you know then you can
[84:08] actually take this law do you remember
[84:11] that I was telling you the twostep
[84:13] process right this what I was trying to
[84:15] do I was looking at the addresses in
[84:18] fact I had a redit CO post called medal
[84:22] flow compare with zip FL law Etc you
[84:25] know there are different type of power
[84:27] laws you know and there was maybe K
[84:29] comparison and say Bitcoin kind of
[84:31] follows in between it's neither Zips and
[84:34] neither metal it looks like something in
[84:37] between uh so I was making all this
[84:39] reasoning by looking at this
[84:41] relationship so basically what this
[84:43] article is about and this article is
[84:45] published in a peer review journal other
[84:48] scientists look at it they agreed it's
[84:51] amazing you know okay you can go ahead
[84:53] and publish
[84:54] and you know and they had like a kind of
[84:56] a prediction of the price of Bitcoin
[84:59] that is kind of basically what I'm
[85:01] saying it's a very regular pattern that
[85:04] is based on a power lad right I did it
[85:06] four years before them they arve to the
[85:09] same conclusion you know so it's good
[85:11] when other
[85:12] scientists kind of support your work you
[85:15] know that say yeah you know you are on
[85:17] the right path you know um this how you
[85:20] do science you know so and it's not just
[85:22] this crazy physicist it's just I'm
[85:23] trying to say say I did it before many
[85:26] other people even if I didn't do in the
[85:28] right platform and also I don't care
[85:32] about who did it first it's just amazing
[85:35] that uh so this is the education part
[85:37] that actually is true and bitcoiner
[85:40] should be aware and not just be coer
[85:43] CNBC should be aware you know ker Kramer
[85:46] should be aware everybody we talk about
[85:48] Bitcoin you cannot talk about Bitcoin
[85:50] unless you realize that Bitcoin doesn't
[85:52] behave like a normal asset so don't talk
[85:54] about your normal way of analyzing a set
[85:57] you should understand power laws you
[85:59] should understand that is different that
[86:01] it behaves in a very regular fashion and
[86:03] it's stable and I know it's weird
[86:05] because people are not used to this
[86:08] right to think that there is an asset
[86:09] that you invest in it and you know what
[86:11] it's going to do 10 years from
[86:13] now it sounds weird but it is like like
[86:17] this and you know these are other graph
[86:19] that we did like for example we did like
[86:21] other things other people say oh but you
[86:24] didn't do all very deep statistical
[86:27] analysis to show that is a power we did
[86:29] we did a lot of different you know and
[86:31] these were for example I work with
[86:33] Burger you know where we wrote different
[86:36] articles we should write actually real
[86:38] scientific paper I that is my next step
[86:41] I want to put all this together and
[86:43] write in a paper but we did a lot of
[86:45] analysis to show that you know this
[86:48] graph what this graph is trying to show
[86:50] like one question is what if I uh did
[86:52] this model five years years ago what if
[86:54] I did six years ago what did I did 10
[86:57] years ago will I get a similar value for
[87:00] the N right for the slope Etc and how
[87:04] much the price is changing relatively to
[87:06] that Trend Etc so you know you can do
[87:09] all kind of different analysis and our
[87:11] conclusion after we did all these
[87:13] analysis that yeah they it seems to
[87:16] follow this pattern all the statistic
[87:19] points to be stable and consistent Etc
[87:23] and it's not a fluke you know so we did
[87:25] all the homework right and so then if
[87:29] you go back because now I show you the
[87:32] line the graph where Bitcoin looks like
[87:34] a straight line but you know once you
[87:37] look at it and you know once every few
[87:40] days should go back and look at the
[87:41] graph in particular when you're worried
[87:43] and you know about Bitcoin Behavior look
[87:45] at the graph and remember it is
[87:47] following this trend right we still like
[87:50] this more linear graph right it's easier
[87:53] for us to think
[87:54] at least the time to be linear so you
[87:57] can always go back and show how that
[88:00] straight line Looks in this graph it
[88:02] doesn't look like again like a straight
[88:05] line but curve but now I use all that
[88:07] knowledge that again from that chart to
[88:10] make a model so I added other components
[88:13] right because beside the general Trend
[88:15] we also have these bubbles right very
[88:18] regular Bubbles and so I say okay can I
[88:21] add these components to my model we do
[88:23] that the time in physics almost like
[88:25] modular you start with a very simple
[88:27] little toy model and then you add more
[88:31] complications right when you study for
[88:32] example a fall of an object you first
[88:36] discard the um the friction of the air
[88:39] right of the resistance of air and then
[88:41] you say okay let's how now that we
[88:44] understand how a Free Falling Body Works
[88:47] in vacuum let's add add air and see how
[88:51] it behaves we do that in physics all the
[88:52] time we had a little comp components to
[88:54] the model so here what I did I added the
[88:57] kind of periodic Behavior around the
[89:00] bubbles I also remember we observe that
[89:03] most of the time during the bare Market
[89:06] the price seems to go down to this about
[89:09] 60% deviation from the trend so I also
[89:12] uh you know I wrot this code to say okay
[89:15] let's Force the price to go there when
[89:18] you know when we are in bare markets uh
[89:21] and then I added you know like I said I
[89:22] added the these
[89:24] sign kind of waves like to show where
[89:28] bubbles are and also because we see
[89:33] these we call it you know diminishing
[89:36] returns basically the deviation from the
[89:39] bottom to the top if you measure the
[89:42] distance from the bottom to the top for
[89:44] each Cycles it BEC smaller and smaller
[89:46] right you can kind of see it with your
[89:48] eyes and and then you I kind of actually
[89:51] measure it it turns out even that is
[89:53] very regular it looks like a a um an
[89:56] exponential but instead of going up it's
[89:59] an exponential that is going down so
[90:00] it's going down pretty fast and so I
[90:03] included that in the model you know I
[90:06] included that change as measure from
[90:09] these Three Peaks and this is why when
[90:11] you go in the future you see how these
[90:12] bubbles are smaller and smaller because
[90:14] I kind of try to mimic these decrease in
[90:19] the size of the bubbles and projected in
[90:21] the future how we how that if it Contin
[90:24] to be like that and it continues to be
[90:25] regular how that will look in the future
[90:28] so I put all the and plus you see it's a
[90:30] little Wiggly this black line because I
[90:32] also put some of the noise right it's a
[90:34] it's not on a daily basis it's h
[90:37] changing a little bit I put actually the
[90:39] real noise that you serve on bitcoin
[90:42] right so of course it's much more
[90:43] regular because this models the entire
[90:46] idea of a model is that they are always
[90:49] simpler than the things they want to
[90:51] describe right because if I put so many
[90:53] elements model where is basic is also
[90:56] called overfeeding because you're
[90:57] thinking that oh it's behaving like this
[91:00] you're adding all these extra pieces and
[91:02] then you're are actually wrong so it's
[91:04] usually good idea to keep the model as
[91:06] simple as possible and you know here
[91:08] there are three simple little additions
[91:13] and when you put them together they
[91:16] really look like doesn't look like a
[91:17] very nice fit to you tell me you think
[91:20] it's a nice representation right
[91:23] simplification
[91:24] Bitcoin Behavior over time if it's
[91:27] almost like a glove right there are some
[91:29] exceptions like here for example right
[91:31] in in the in the last cycle not just
[91:34] before the last Cycles but in general it
[91:36] looks very pretty fit right pretty nice
[91:39] fit and so then you say okay let's say
[91:42] that it continues to behave in that way
[91:44] let projected in the future because
[91:45] these are all equations of time so I can
[91:48] plug in future times and then see how it
[91:52] it develops in the future and so we will
[91:55] see right is he going to do that we will
[91:58] see it will be really nice right maybe
[92:00] in six months from now one year from now
[92:02] you know we can have another talk and we
[92:04] can compare right and see how it looks
[92:06] like and so it looks like you know this
[92:09] is what is going to do and if he's going
[92:10] to do that then we can tell what the
[92:13] price will be um in during the peak I
[92:16] already told you it's going to be around
[92:18] 2,00
[92:19] 210,000 then see the nice thing that is
[92:22] going down and then when it's going down
[92:26] is we're reaching this bottom I think I
[92:28] calculated is going to be around 60,000
[92:31] so we're not going to see anything below
[92:33] 60,000 ever in the history of Bitcoin
[92:36] and so I will continue I will continue
[92:38] until in 200 33 we're going to be 1
[92:43] million and again if Bitcoin does what
[92:46] he did for the last 15 years is
[92:49] basically unavoidable it's going to
[92:51] happen and we can tell even when so you
[92:53] know this is the beauty of this model am
[92:55] I right am I wrong we will see this is
[92:58] how you do science you make an
[92:59] hypothesis this is nothing else when a
[93:01] scientific hypothesis the data you know
[93:05] and people even I heard other
[93:07] non-scientific people they want to use
[93:09] scientific language and don't know what
[93:11] they're talking about say oh the model
[93:13] is not Fifi it's very falsifiable right
[93:16] you want a model to be falsifiable
[93:18] because if you make an hypothesis and
[93:21] the data is not right you know the data
[93:23] doesn't show that your model it can
[93:25] really predict the future behavior and
[93:29] by the way again I want to respond also
[93:31] to the people say the past doesn't
[93:33] predict the future what else will you
[93:35] use to predict the future the past is
[93:37] that you know with asset usually that
[93:40] doesn't work very well but with very
[93:42] regular almost you know natural law type
[93:46] of phenomena like Bitcoin yes you know
[93:49] this is exactly what you do you take the
[93:51] past you look at what happened in the
[93:53] past and you project it in the future
[93:55] This Is How We Do Science this is how we
[93:56] know that there will be an eclipse in
[93:59] this given time right and
[94:02] so uh you know if you and so I made this
[94:06] joke this is like a you know kind of a
[94:09] meme because I'm trying to be also
[94:10] entertaining on the social media you
[94:12] know and so here I show what uh you know
[94:15] the usual media uh talks about you know
[94:18] like always this graph this sad graph
[94:20] you know it doesn't so messy doesn't
[94:22] look anywhere you know CR crer CR always
[94:26] you know say oh bad things about Bitcoin
[94:29] and this is what I usually show you see
[94:30] even here in the chart only linear time
[94:33] you know never never a log chart they
[94:35] don't even show this log linear and they
[94:38] you know I use saor because kind of now
[94:41] he's like kind of an enlighted bitcoiner
[94:44] but most of us right most of the
[94:46] bitcoiners that are familiar with this
[94:48] but they're not familiar with this right
[94:49] this where I came in Crazy Italian
[94:52] scientist that tells you know it is a
[94:54] very nice precise pattern and this
[94:57] pattern is not just like a nice fitting
[95:01] doesn't have anything to do with fitting
[95:02] the fitting is just a tool to extract
[95:05] the power you know and that is not where
[95:08] the emphasis is is the fact that it
[95:10] don't look at your eyes I don't need to
[95:12] make any complicated ma mat you know
[95:14] tell me how do I get such nice regular
[95:17] pattern that it's just striking with
[95:21] your eye because uh that is where you
[95:23] intuition comes from it's not anymore a
[95:25] question of math it's a question of
[95:27] looking at the graph you know this why I
[95:29] argue many times with this pedantic ma
[95:31] people they don't know Ma because they
[95:33] just studied in school but they don't
[95:35] use it on a daily level they don't leave
[95:38] it they don't make it you know their own
[95:40] way of thinking about the entire
[95:42] universe and they tell me oh the mat
[95:45] here the mat the M look at before you do
[95:47] any mat look at the graph the graph look
[95:49] like straight line you cannot deny it
[95:51] you know so if you do something that
[95:53] your your mat is telling you that is not
[95:55] a straight line probably you did
[95:56] something wrong you know or you don't
[95:58] understand what is going on you don't
[96:00] understand the purpose of this we are
[96:01] focusing those scale we are focusing on
[96:04] big large changes we are not looking at
[96:06] the details you know this is what is all
[96:08] about many times we say yeah you know
[96:10] you're of course your graph looks like
[96:12] in a in a log log KN because you're
[96:14] repressing the noise that is exactly
[96:16] what I'm trying to do I'm telling you
[96:18] once once you forget about the noise
[96:21] repress it you make it small then looks
[96:23] like there is a pattern you know it's a
[96:26] way of looking at stuff that you were
[96:29] going to be distracted by the noise
[96:32] noise in the linear chart is not a story
[96:34] the signal is in the log log chart and
[96:37] I'm you know I show you already I'm not
[96:40] just me that does this kind of things
[96:41] scientists do that all the time so if
[96:43] you don't know that go and study science
[96:46] okay and come back and then let's have a
[96:47] discussion if you don't know that go and
[96:49] study science that is my message to you
[96:52] all these critics that don't know
[96:54] anything you know I'm sorry if I am
[96:55] angry with them but you know I'm kind of
[96:57] a little bit tired of repeating the same
[96:59] thing over and over again you know I was
[97:02] not born yesterday I have a a white
[97:05] beard you know so and I have a PhD in
[97:07] physics and there are other phds
[97:10] publishing Bitcoins and power Lads you
[97:12] know I mean anyway this is
[97:14] aide they show you just want to quickly
[97:17] jump in I think um I think this is all
[97:21] bitcoiners are used to that like um
[97:24] because we are still so early and uh not
[97:26] a lot of people actually know about
[97:28] Bitcoin and I also have this feeling
[97:31] when I talk with people since the last
[97:34] four years in Bitcoin and talking about
[97:36] why Bitcoin makes sense I think like I
[97:39] can like tell the same thing over and
[97:42] over again and it's frustrating but I
[97:44] think it's important if you have
[97:46] something that you really believe in and
[97:48] you think it's true that you tell the
[97:50] world uh even if uh people don't
[97:53] appreciate that like and just put it you
[97:56] know I'm amazed about bitcoiners because
[97:58] you know they come from all different
[98:00] backgrounds not all of them understand
[98:02] science but when they look at graph like
[98:04] this it's not because it's confirmation
[98:06] bias oh look Bitcoin is amazing of
[98:08] course no because I think these people
[98:11] have something special in particular
[98:14] this particular stage right and more
[98:16] earlier you came in and you know we have
[98:20] different experiences in life and you
[98:22] know some of you guys have so young but
[98:24] 10 years ago you were a baby so how
[98:26] could you get in Bitcoin you didn't even
[98:29] understand it right so there is
[98:31] something special about bitcoiners that
[98:33] have this intuition you know maybe they
[98:35] cannot express it in all this m Etc but
[98:38] they get it they get it they understand
[98:40] and it's not just about you know making
[98:42] a lot of money it's the entire
[98:44] philosophy behind right it allows us to
[98:47] be free from government okay you don't
[98:50] you don't care about me because you're
[98:52] printing money and you're making the
[98:53] richer richer I'm going to invest in
[98:55] Bitcoin goodbye you know so these are
[98:57] people that are revolutionary they are
[99:00] early adopter they look forward and so
[99:03] even if you have different experiences
[99:04] we are all like a big family because we
[99:07] understand each other right we have we
[99:09] are contributing different way maybe you
[99:11] you contribute somewhere else right when
[99:14] you talk about Bitcoin in your own way
[99:16] this other person is doing in it this
[99:17] other way all of us have something to
[99:20] contribute and we always understand the
[99:22] same thing my contribution here been
[99:25] passionate about math and physics is to
[99:28] give a physics look right but yeah I I
[99:32] cannot I I don't know have to convince
[99:35] Bitcoin because they know already maybe
[99:37] they are surprised like see this is the
[99:39] last graph I going to show you sorry if
[99:41] I'm taking so much time but uh there is
[99:44] so much interesting things you know like
[99:46] these are one of the things that I did
[99:48] recently I started to combine both this
[99:51] uh growth along the power law with the
[99:55] regularity of a pattern so there is such
[99:57] a thing right if you put and I didn't
[100:01] come up with this idea of putting
[100:02] Bitcoin on a circular map other people
[100:04] came up I think one of the first people
[100:07] is called rational rout I think there
[100:08] was somebody else but again it doesn't
[100:10] matter if we came up all of us
[100:13] contribute right we all work on each
[100:15] other and work and contribute right so
[100:19] my contribution and so IDE is basically
[100:23] you it's something that uh again like
[100:25] the log plot the log log plot is not my
[100:28] original idea it's something that is
[100:30] done all the time we always in physics
[100:33] always when we try to understand
[100:35] something that is cyclical because you
[100:37] know Bitcoin has this foure Cycles right
[100:40] because of the alving you want to put it
[100:42] in a map where time is the is the angle
[100:46] right like in a clock it's not so
[100:48] difficult to understand right it's like
[100:50] a clock right time in a in like maybe
[100:54] young people are not used to analog
[100:57] clocks right
[100:58] with
[101:00] end but us you know older people like me
[101:04] with this what we use for some time you
[101:06] know and they are beautiful right
[101:08] because it's a analog it's mechanical
[101:11] you know but uh you know the the end the
[101:14] time there if you think about is
[101:16] basically the angle right bigger the
[101:18] angle bigger the time right and if you
[101:21] do an entire cycle it's basically
[101:23] 12 hours right for the clock and then
[101:26] another cycle two two cycles is an
[101:28] entire day right with Bitcoin one cycle
[101:31] is for years so you can do the same
[101:32] thing you can create a clock basically
[101:34] and you say okay I look at the p and in
[101:36] that case you see there not going to be
[101:38] a circle because the radius what the
[101:40] radius represents is the price so
[101:42] because the price goes up instead of
[101:44] being a circle it's going to be a spiral
[101:46] right because a spiral is basically like
[101:48] a circle that has an increasing radius
[101:51] right but the beauty of it is when and I
[101:54] don't have it graph here but you can
[101:55] find it in my um my YouTube on my X it
[102:00] looks amazing particular if you again
[102:03] you're trying to average out the Noise
[102:05] by taking averages over a long period of
[102:07] time let's say one year it looks like a
[102:10] beautiful beautiful spiral and it's a
[102:13] power law it's called a power law spiral
[102:15] right because given that the part is
[102:17] described by a power law the spiral is a
[102:20] power law spiral and there is such a
[102:22] think in nature
[102:23] again where a lot of different processes
[102:26] are explained by power LW spirals like
[102:30] for example the trees in a ring you know
[102:32] with three rings with three rings the
[102:35] way they grow it's a power low spiral
[102:39] the how the horns you know like in a ram
[102:42] where the horns curl on themselves that
[102:45] growth of that natural object it's a
[102:48] power loss spiral you know our planets
[102:51] form and they form like this Beau
[102:53] spirals of the Galaxy Etc power loss
[102:56] spiral Bitcoin is a power loss spiral so
[102:59] if you combine both the cyclical nature
[103:03] of Bitcoin and the fact that follows a
[103:06] power law and you put it all together is
[103:09] a power loss spiral that is something
[103:12] that I realized recently and when you
[103:14] put it all together now we basically
[103:15] crack Bitcoin because look at this here
[103:18] in this graph you know the top part is
[103:21] my is a trading View
[103:23] script that they wrote right is an
[103:25] indicator so you see the general Trend
[103:28] it's kind of a little bit wavy because
[103:30] it's adaptive this is a like a an
[103:33] addition that they did like instead of
[103:34] being like one big straight line taking
[103:36] all the data is kind of adapting a
[103:39] little bit to the local data so it kind
[103:41] of also works in trying to tell you the
[103:44] local Trend instead of a general Trend
[103:47] it those both in a sense so you see the
[103:49] general power low Trend and then and see
[103:53] how you know it catches the bottom see
[103:55] how here the purple was perfectly
[103:57] telling where the bottom was Etc but
[103:59] then I made another indicator where I
[104:02] basically took this spiral something
[104:05] that looks like a clock because it's
[104:07] thinking in very linear terms so I came
[104:09] up with the best thing that could do to
[104:11] represent the spiral that is basically
[104:14] you know you can take a if you move
[104:16] around the circle right you can project
[104:18] uh the dot around the C Circle you can
[104:21] project it on the x or the y axis right
[104:25] I don't know if you ever there are
[104:26] animations of that like if you took a
[104:28] physics class or there are things like
[104:30] that online right and then basically
[104:32] what you get is the sign a sign wave
[104:34] because a sign waves basically is a
[104:36] representation of a of a of a cycle so
[104:40] it's a circle right so if you have a and
[104:42] in this case it will look like it
[104:43] doesn't look much here but uh if you go
[104:46] back to previous cycle you see these
[104:49] oscillations they became bigger and
[104:51] bigger and bigger because the price
[104:52] became bigger and bigger right so you
[104:54] can see that this little first s
[104:57] semicircle is a little bit smaller than
[104:59] the other one this represents the price
[105:02] becoming bigger and bigger and bigger so
[105:03] this is the spiral I try to uh show how
[105:06] the spiral looks like in a linear graph
[105:09] and so the red one is basically the
[105:12] model the power low model that is this
[105:14] blue line maybe I should use the same
[105:16] colors but is basically the Blue Line in
[105:18] the linear graph so see how it follows
[105:22] the very very closely the price of
[105:25] Bitcoin that in this second chart is
[105:27] this blue line right that is kind of
[105:30] Wiggly because you know the price
[105:31] locally of course is going to be uh you
[105:34] know noisy but in general look how
[105:36] fantastically well it follows that blue
[105:40] line and then the C I say oh it looks
[105:43] like a clock so we have Z o' 3 o' six
[105:46] o'clock and all these critical points in
[105:49] this clock right uh are actually
[105:53] significant because for example at 0:00
[105:56] you have a top look at this see follow a
[105:59] little white line here you see how it's
[106:03] exactly the top right and then 3 o'cl
[106:06] what is 3 o'cl it's the bottom look at
[106:08] this it's exactly where the bottom is
[106:10] look at six o'clock what is six o'clock
[106:12] well six o'clock is basically we went
[106:15] through this bare Market Etc you know
[106:17] the price was kind of moving along this
[106:20] power LW you know with some noise and
[106:22] Etc and then we reach a bottom it's
[106:25] basically you are leaving
[106:28] a behind the bare Market this is when
[106:32] you're leaving behind so I called it the
[106:35] transition from the bear to the start of
[106:38] a of a bull market so this is when the
[106:40] bull market starts then you reach 9 o'
[106:43] and this when the LI the price goes
[106:46] above a trend line and that is usually
[106:48] when you have a a much crazier bull
[106:51] market when things are really so it's I
[106:53] called the transition to full bull
[106:55] market or frenzy bull market so again if
[106:59] you look at this point it's a very
[107:02] significant important point because
[107:04] things from that moment on are going to
[107:05] be like crazy and look at this again
[107:08] look how precise and I went back I
[107:10] cannot show it here because would be too
[107:12] clutter but if if you go to the previous
[107:15] cycle is exactly like this all cycle
[107:18] perfectly look at this I'm not making a
[107:20] nap right so in a graph you can even say
[107:23] oh maybe you manipulate a little bit
[107:24] with graph no you know I
[107:28] actually uh trading view is doing it
[107:31] right you cannot manipulate trading View
[107:33] and look how perfect it is do you agree
[107:36] does it look very regular does it look
[107:38] like we are finding very important
[107:41] points on the chart it it's fascinating
[107:44] that uh it actually matches with the
[107:46] cycle and follows that kind of a power
[107:49] law and I'm just now like I'm because I
[107:54] came really uh new to this topic I
[107:56] wanted to don't research too much about
[107:59] it and come with a new mind to it
[108:02] because I think most listeners are also
[108:04] come with that new mind to to that power
[108:06] law topic uh and I think it's a lot to
[108:10] process and I think uh and I recommend
[108:13] that to everyone that's kind of where I
[108:16] am right now where I'm like this is
[108:18] fascinating and I want to understand
[108:19] more of it uh I I actually Rec commend
[108:23] and I never did that before I recommend
[108:25] just listening to to the whole thing
[108:28] twice because uh it's it's something
[108:32] there's a lot of information a lot of
[108:34] information a lot of things to take in
[108:36] and uh I think it's a perfect even like
[108:38] a kind of a master class for power law
[108:40] like an introduction class uh where it's
[108:43] like we started wise power law the
[108:45] nature stuff then on bitcoin and now
[108:48] we're getting really in the charts and I
[108:51] honestly I would I would love to give
[108:53] you feedback right now but I'm kind of
[108:56] overwhelmed with a lot of information
[108:58] the only thing I can definitely say uh
[109:01] it's fascinating and uh you made me
[109:05] curious to learn uh more about it and
[109:08] you see by way we just uh so because
[109:11] this is where we are right now right so
[109:14] the time and fact will be really cool
[109:16] that people start to adopt to this
[109:17] language right what is a what is the
[109:19] time on the uh you know power power low
[109:24] spiral clock right the PLS clock uh and
[109:28] you can say right right now it's like
[109:29] what and I can even calculate in fact I
[109:31] want to make a a clock and put it online
[109:35] live you know so people can see what
[109:36] time it is on the clock so right now
[109:39] it's basically maybe like what 65 610
[109:42] and that means we are over this bump
[109:46] that represents a transition from be to
[109:48] start of a bull market right so really
[109:50] cool that this kind of feels like that
[109:52] right that we left behind the bull
[109:54] market the bare market and we are
[109:56] entering the bull market we are not yet
[109:57] in the frenzy period right when it's 9
[110:00] o'clock but it's really cool it's a way
[110:03] of thinking about these cycles and using
[110:05] this terminology it's a really another
[110:08] interesting way of talking about Bitcoin
[110:11] right maybe it's a it will people will
[110:13] stick with that terminology right what
[110:14] time it is oh 6:15 930 you know and it's
[110:18] very useful because it tells you what to
[110:20] do you know if you want to do investing
[110:22] because it depends on your style like we
[110:24] discussed in the beginning maybe want to
[110:26] Old you know like you probably don't
[110:28] want to buy Bitcoin when it's uh Zer o'
[110:31] clock because you know just wait until
[110:34] it's three o'clock and then byy you know
[110:36] save your money so if this continues to
[110:39] do the same thing it gives you an idea
[110:42] of when is you know when you should do
[110:44] theca and if you want to continue maybe
[110:46] do a little bit less DCA right when you
[110:48] are close to Zer and then go really ay
[110:51] when it is three o' and so on and so on
[110:54] I think I think this would be actually
[110:57] these are we we can end here if you if
[110:59] you want because I made this joke and
[111:02] you I say I'm going to the I'm going to
[111:04] tell everybody about power loss I'm
[111:05] going to the physics conference you know
[111:08] to the Bitcoin conference actually I
[111:10] didn't invent these are these actually
[111:13] power laws are so used in physics that
[111:16] we kind of almost like make fun of
[111:17] ourselves so somebody else made this
[111:19] shirt because it's a internal joke that
[111:22] it's there are so common and so many
[111:24] papers are published about finding power
[111:26] lws everywhere that you know we want to
[111:29] you know be a little bit
[111:30] self-deprecating so we made a joke oh
[111:32] you know I went to a physic conference
[111:34] and all I I got was allous po law and
[111:37] they say okay I'm going to scratch
[111:39] physics and I going to say Bitcoin I'm
[111:41] going to sell a bunch of shirt to the
[111:43] next Bitcoin conference you know and
[111:46] this is my like one of our repr
[111:48] presentation kind of colorcoded you know
[111:51] rela where we are
[111:53] and so you know it's it's yeah you know
[111:56] we should always make fun of ourself you
[111:58] know we we should not take ourself too
[112:00] seriously but you know still even if it
[112:04] is a meme there is some truth there you
[112:06] know and and it's really really
[112:09] fascinating and you know I would like to
[112:11] explore this with other Bitcoin
[112:14] bitcoiners or come to my ex account come
[112:17] to the YouTube you know and let's talk
[112:20] about these things you know and trying
[112:21] to understand Bitcoin better better yeah
[112:23] I think a website where you show like a
[112:25] clock and which time it is and stuff
[112:27] like that uh this would be really good
[112:29] in in marketing this this whole idea
[112:32] that where you can put uh put people ASW
[112:36] like this is the weight weighted DCA you
[112:38] should have and with a normal DSA you
[112:40] would have so much Bitcoin with weighted
[112:42] DSA you would have so much Bitcoin like
[112:44] I I think you can do a lot of marketing
[112:47] stuff on top of this model because there
[112:50] like data there's the models but then
[112:52] you also have to put it in nice charts
[112:55] in nice marketing things uh to people
[112:58] that people grasp uh things and this is
[113:01] basically what I want to do with with
[113:03] Bitcoin itself like make it uh by way I
[113:05] really love your accent you know I think
[113:07] this will be really a cool interview
[113:09] where there are two people with some
[113:11] crazy accents right yours is more like
[113:14] what Egger accent you know but is really
[113:18] nice I love it I get it a lot that I
[113:21] speak like Arnold Schwartz
[113:23] and there are some people that uh want
[113:27] me to say get back to the chopper
[113:31] for I I'll be back they they wanted me
[113:35] to say that for a long time in the
[113:36] podcast now and I think my this is my
[113:38] 55th podcast so I finally did it I
[113:41] finally said
[113:42] it yes yes because you know you find
[113:45] somebody else with a even stronger
[113:46] accent than yours you know and hopefully
[113:49] people understand what we're talking
[113:50] about but I think actually would be
[113:52] really cute you know that both of us
[113:53] have a strong accents you know so it's
[113:56] so so cool yeah it's it tells also about
[114:00] you know how Universal Bitcoin is right
[114:03] because people from different countries
[114:04] different experiences you know we all
[114:07] come together it's a world thing right
[114:09] so different accent different cultures
[114:11] you know it's really amazing you know
[114:13] it's a that is one of the cool thing
[114:15] about being in this space that you meet
[114:16] so many different people from different
[114:19] country different backgrounds you know
[114:20] and we have all this common things you
[114:23] know that we love freedom we want to do
[114:27] amazing things in the world you know so
[114:30] yeah it's exciting yeah it's it's it's
[114:33] like an uh it's like a base layer to our
[114:36] whole for natural system and finances is
[114:40] so fundamental to our life that it's
[114:42] like unites whole uh the whole globe
[114:45] with like one uh base layer of asset
[114:48] like it's an it's interesting thought
[114:50] model like where can this go when we
[114:53] like looking 50 100 years in the future
[114:56] and how will society change when we have
[114:59] one fundamental layer that's all across
[115:02] the the globe and there's a lot of
[115:04] freedom involved in there like but yeah
[115:06] this is this is one thing because I
[115:08] wanted to start the the podcast because
[115:10] I think we are in a really early stage
[115:13] of an extreme Revolution and the goal
[115:17] that I have to interview as many Bitcoin
[115:20] as as possible I'm now doing seven seven
[115:24] to nine podcasts a week I'm publishing
[115:27] five of them per week I want to publish
[115:30] like six and go to a daily upload
[115:32] schedule at some point but I need more
[115:35] time for that and in March I make the
[115:37] step to do it full-time like now I'm
[115:39] working till parttime but in March I'm
[115:41] going full-time on that so uh and I just
[115:45] want to document uh the thoughts because
[115:48] yeah we don't have the documentation of
[115:50] the internet that well imagine a podcast
[115:54] that uh interviews all the people
[115:56] involved in building up the internet in
[115:59] 1995 that would be sick to watch and
[116:02] this is basically what I want to do with
[116:04] with with my podcast documenting the
[116:06] whole journey it's a very good idea and
[116:08] I really enjoy your um podcast I watch
[116:11] it all the time every time you have an
[116:12] interview because it's also a way of
[116:15] knowing different bitcoiners what
[116:16] they're doing you know what is uh their
[116:19] way because everybody's contributing
[116:21] their own ways you know like different
[116:23] projects different ideas different
[116:25] approaches it's all fantastic yeah
[116:27] perfect um we are the first time ever
[116:31] I'm approaching the 2hour mark oh sorry
[116:33] for that no no it's I think it's
[116:36] something good because if you have a lot
[116:38] of talk it means there's a lot of value
[116:40] and content in there uh and I think uh
[116:45] the longer I do the podcast the longer
[116:46] the podcasts will go but yeah let's see
[116:50] um and we having if you watch the
[116:52] podcast we're having an end routine uh
[116:54] where the previous guest asked question
[116:57] for the next guest uh your previous
[116:59] guest was knut swanholm you probably
[117:03] know him the the the author of like
[117:05] really cool books and I think he
[117:07] invented the meme of uh everything
[117:09] divided by 21 million uh
[117:13] and lot of cool stuff and he asked you
[117:16] the question uh it's like you have to
[117:18] know a film for that question but I
[117:21] didn't know about that question what is
[117:24] the air speed velocity of an unladen
[117:28] swallow oh this is a multi python MTI
[117:33] yeah yeah yeah yeah he so cool I I don't
[117:36] remember what was the answer uh I am an
[117:38] ND and I love MTI python but uh I I
[117:41] remember the context right that it was
[117:45] basically you know they say where do you
[117:47] get these coconuts because we were uh
[117:49] playing you know I actually remember
[117:51] that movie so funny because I I was like
[117:54] a kid and I was uh very much in Middle
[117:57] AG things and all of a sudden you know
[118:00] they say oh and now we have a Monti
[118:02] Python and the search of olig say oh
[118:04] cool you know because I knew what the
[118:06] olra was it's a middle age movie it's a
[118:09] night movie you know then I I look at
[118:11] this thing I said what the heck is going
[118:14] on guys coconuts you know we have
[118:17] coconuts for to play their horse woles
[118:21] you know and it and the Italian version
[118:24] is all in dialects every you know the
[118:26] French are Sicilian talking in Sicilians
[118:28] and you know because in Italy we have
[118:30] all these different dialects you know
[118:32] and it was so funny I was like I was
[118:35] disappointed because you know I wanted a
[118:37] serious night movies at the same time it
[118:39] was so funny that uh I was like rolling
[118:42] on the ground I still remember the first
[118:44] experience and I do remember that
[118:46] passage because you know they said where
[118:48] did you you know this is zland where did
[118:49] you get the coconuts and and they
[118:51] started to say well came from asaro but
[118:54] you know asaro cannot really live to it
[118:56] and we have all this very indepth
[118:59] discussion about the physics of f flight
[119:01] of a of a sparrow and I don't remember
[119:05] you know what the exact thing was but it
[119:08] was this crazy calculations they were
[119:10] doing about you know how far asaro could
[119:13] go with the coconut Etc so larious and I
[119:16] think actually is relevant because you
[119:18] know it's like kind of a
[119:20] self-deprecating thing right in one end
[119:23] yeah very all this mat Etc but you know
[119:26] like a little bit like this meme right
[119:28] you know
[119:29] like know it's not that you're going to
[119:32] try to push it forever where okay you
[119:34] know yeah it's everything a power law
[119:36] Etc but you know the same time even that
[119:39] Meme was funny because in a cental sense
[119:42] it's true right how the heck asaro can
[119:44] bring a know if you use physics you
[119:47] realize it's impossible right so it was
[119:49] a joke but it was not a joke at the same
[119:51] time right right so it's relevant so
[119:53] even if I didn't answer straight I think
[119:55] a kind of answer right do you agree yeah
[119:58] definitely I actually when he asked the
[120:01] question I was like what is that and oh
[120:03] it's a Monte Pyon uh thing I think it's
[120:06] from
[120:09] uhon and the search of H yeah yeah the H
[120:13] yeah it's like 9070 80 or something like
[120:16] that it's like an old movie right right
[120:18] I think it was classic right it was
[120:20] around that time when my father was born
[120:22] so it's like it's long before my time
[120:25] right right yeah but you you find it on
[120:27] the internet and you know usually like
[120:29] very nerdy people they memorize it you
[120:32] know like all the lines Etc so for sure
[120:36] he's a nerd like me and I knew the
[120:38] context like I say I don't remember by
[120:41] heart the the discussion but it was all
[120:43] about you know using physics to
[120:45] understand how come these guys have
[120:47] coconuts right because they using Co
[120:50] it's very absurd right it's like this
[120:53] English humor that is like absurd right
[120:56] um it's uh it's not realistic but yeah
[121:00] and I love that he put the question and
[121:03] you got the question because it's is not
[121:06] plann something like I I don't plan when
[121:09] who is on like as I do it with you like
[121:12] I just send a link out and you pick your
[121:15] date and time when you have time uh and
[121:18] he also and it's it's fascinating than
[121:21] he uh gives the question to you because
[121:23] I think it's it's it it fits you
[121:25] perfectly I think to 90% of all the
[121:28] other guests uh it would have not been
[121:31] as suitable for that
[121:34] question yeah he ask a right question
[121:37] yes pertinent yeah it's meaningful
[121:40] perfect then uh um before we end is
[121:43] there anything you want to to add to
[121:45] today uh and where can people find you
[121:49] the best way like where can and you were
[121:50] saying I need to make up questions but I
[121:52] can do that offline for the next yeah
