[00:00] everything is a fraud except for Bitcoin
[00:02] we are living in the information age and
[00:03] it's about time for a lot of people to
[00:05] wake up to that fact no wonder that our
[00:08] whole society is filled with fraud from
[00:11] the individual level to the governmental
[00:13] level you always feel the shoe on your
[00:15] face you know like bum BM bum it would
[00:17] make sense to use a fiat currency like
[00:20] Euro or dollars and back it with Bitcoin
[00:22] that's why some Finance experts become
[00:24] very emotional because Bitcoin is
[00:26] Paradigm Shift the more money they print
[00:28] from now on the higher the price of
[00:30] Bitcoin is going to get and will take
[00:31] away this this power and give it to
[00:33] critical thinkers like you and me and
[00:35] other bitcoiners they just uh were able
[00:37] to shut your bank account down and this
[00:40] made a lot of people be quiet they saw
[00:42] what happened to other people who spoke
[00:44] up and they be like I don't want you to
[00:45] have anything to do with it so they were
[00:46] like I'm just going along it's okay and
[00:48] I understand that because it was really
[00:50] scary and it's still not over what do
[00:52] you prefer Trust of a system that's
[00:54] corrupt obviously which can be proven or
[00:56] do you want to use technology that is
[00:58] provably the truth I knew this is good
[01:01] and I knew this is a punch in the face
[01:03] of people who are
[01:04] [Music]
[01:07] corrupt what's the initial spark that
[01:10] you had with with the book like why did
[01:12] you write the book um so I'm originally
[01:15] a singer and music producer and um Along
[01:20] Came the pandemic and kind of changed
[01:23] everything and I was kind of shocked
[01:25] about how the politics uh changed the
[01:29] general rules of life for everybody and
[01:32] even even more that most people just
[01:34] went along with it even though it was
[01:37] partially very very confusing and uh
[01:40] obviously wrong and um uh suddenly I you
[01:45] know normally you sit down as a music
[01:47] producer and you'll be like okay let's
[01:48] start a new song let's start a new track
[01:50] and then you sit down on the piano and
[01:52] you play something and you get inspired
[01:53] and then you know one thing comes to the
[01:55] next and you have a finished product
[01:57] right and uh during that time I was like
[02:00] I was sitting down and I was like and
[02:03] somehow I wasn't inspired anymore and um
[02:07] there is the story about the the guy who
[02:09] um who was experimenting with dogs and
[02:12] uh in Russia it's Ivan Pavlov and um so
[02:16] he he put a glass on the mouth of the
[02:19] dogs and then he gave them food and then
[02:22] he measured the amount of spy spit that
[02:26] flowed into the glass right and uh after
[02:29] a while he gave them food and he rang a
[02:31] bell and the dogs had a lot of spit you
[02:35] know and then he only had the the Bell
[02:38] but no food but the dogs still were you
[02:41] know I don't know the English word for
[02:43] zaban but you know it was still flowing
[02:46] although there was no food but they
[02:47] connected the Bell to the food right so
[02:52] um and then there was a flat and the um
[02:56] the labor where he was working where the
[02:59] dogs were experimenting with um got
[03:02] flooded and a lot of them died but some
[03:05] were rescued and then he found them and
[03:08] he rang the bell again and this time
[03:11] they didn't uh there was no spit you
[03:14] know and uh because they they were so
[03:17] shocked that something in their brain
[03:19] got messed up and
[03:21] rewired and um I think that's something
[03:25] along that way kind of happened to me
[03:28] and then I was uh you know I had this
[03:30] idea to to you know write a book or to
[03:33] you know to uh put a spotlight on the
[03:37] fraudulent world that we are living in
[03:39] um because I also think it's kind of
[03:41] entertaining if you're not directly
[03:43] involved with it and uh and then
[03:46] suddenly came the the idea to write a
[03:48] book and then I you know woke up in the
[03:51] morning and I opened the laptop and I
[03:53] started writing and I didn't uh look at
[03:56] the clock until 2: p.m. and I wasn't
[04:00] didn't even have breakfast right and so
[04:04] the creativity that I I had for the
[04:06] music for music ruction kind of switched
[04:08] to um to writing I don't know why
[04:12] because I'm dyslexic actually but uh it
[04:15] happened and so and when I start
[04:18] something I try to you know pull through
[04:20] and finish it and um try to bring it to
[04:23] the success and that's um yeah that's
[04:25] what so two weeks ago the book came out
[04:28] in German no and and uh yeah and then
[04:32] yesterday uh we met at the BTC in Prague
[04:36] so uh and now I have to you know go to
[04:38] podcast and talk about it so people will
[04:41] recognize it and hopefully buy
[04:44] it it's like it's a it will be a great
[04:47] uh success I think so it's a topic is
[04:49] really interesting but before we come to
[04:51] the to the podcast I have uh to the the
[04:53] book I have one more question um I just
[04:56] thought about that when you when you
[04:57] write songs it's also like you're
[04:59] writing text you all of like you can
[05:01] even make an argument that you write
[05:03] like a small story with like a melody
[05:06] and stuff like that how how did this
[05:07] help you like in in in writing a book
[05:09] was it is it similar than that I think
[05:12] so yes um so you have to uh in if you
[05:16] write a song you have to um you know
[05:18] start at the beginning and then you make
[05:21] it interesting interesting interesting
[05:23] and then you finish it and the finishing
[05:25] and the beginning are somehow connected
[05:27] you know so it makes all sense and it
[05:29] keeps you glued to the to the content of
[05:31] the song um and even if you don't have
[05:35] lyrics you know still the music that you
[05:37] produce because my music is mostly like
[05:39] for TV shows and advertisings um you
[05:43] still need to keep it interesting right
[05:46] and uh I think it's a very similar um
[05:49] process if you write a book you have to
[05:51] you know hook the people and then you
[05:53] have to keep them entertained and keep
[05:56] them moving and you have to keep a red
[05:58] line that goes through the whole book
[06:00] and I hope that I achieved that and um
[06:03] you know bring content to the people
[06:06] that because most people are like
[06:08] Bitcoin I mean like yeah it's who it's
[06:11] digital money whatever you know it's
[06:13] cryptographic most people are like I
[06:15] don't know I don't care and my book has
[06:17] a completely different angle it's uh you
[06:20] know puts a spotlight on how fraudulent
[06:22] the world is from the individual level
[06:24] to the um level of governments and um
[06:28] how Bitcoin could change this to uh to a
[06:32] better world and I think this is a new
[06:34] portal for people who are kind of
[06:37] interested in Bitcoin but you know they
[06:39] are not very technical and to prefer a
[06:42] good story you know um maybe that's
[06:46] that's a book for them so um yeah and I
[06:50] now took the German title and just like
[06:52] translated it to like everything is a
[06:54] scam except Bitcoin is is would you go
[06:56] with that kind of a translation yeah I
[06:58] I'm not sure if fraud or scam is the
[07:01] right word but everything is a fraud
[07:03] except for Bitcoin would be a sufficient
[07:05] title I hope nobody's going to steal
[07:06] this now you
[07:08] know but uh yeah exactly everything is a
[07:11] fraud except for Bitcoin and if you want
[07:14] I can explain uh how how this idea came
[07:17] up yes definitely and and uh like how
[07:21] did this idea came up and and then maybe
[07:23] like let's because I think uh really
[07:25] important is for us to Define what's
[07:28] fraud I feel like like in especially in
[07:30] the internet days uh it it's so it's so
[07:34] easy to say like oh you're a fraud oh
[07:37] this is a fraud and it's like but how do
[07:39] you define fraud like it's like I even
[07:42] get comments like oh Bitcoin is a fraud
[07:44] like I hear hear that in the comments
[07:46] quite regular like every two weeks I get
[07:48] one kind of a comment like that and I
[07:50] always like don't don't hate them I just
[07:53] like ask like oh how do you define fraud
[07:55] and how does this connect to bitcoin and
[07:57] usually there's no answer to that most
[08:00] people that say like oh that's a fraud
[08:01] don't even have an answer or definition
[08:02] of a fraud but first let's go to um what
[08:06] you said how you came up with the
[08:09] idea um so I think fraud is uh if you uh
[08:14] try to project a reality reality to
[08:17] someone that doesn't exist okay and um
[08:21] Bitcoin is not a fraud it's a technology
[08:24] it's a real thing it's information and
[08:26] we are living in the information age and
[08:28] it's uh about time for a lot of people
[08:31] to wake up to that fact you know because
[08:33] you have Facebook you have uh other
[08:36] digital companies they are they are
[08:39] purely digital okay they have their
[08:40] servers and stuff you know but in the
[08:42] end it's just information and they get a
[08:44] lot of money with that I mean Bill Gates
[08:47] Mark Zuckerberg you know the the guys
[08:49] from Google right they are they have
[08:51] become billionaires and because
[08:54] information is um is a form of energy
[08:57] too okay and um I explain that in my
[09:00] book a little bit deeper um when I go
[09:03] through the history of how how money
[09:05] developed and um so how do you define a
[09:10] fraud it's you know you you you you
[09:14] protect or you um make a reality up that
[09:18] doesn't exist and in that during that
[09:21] process you steal the monetary energy of
[09:24] someone that's mainly what I think fraud
[09:26] is you know so and if people believe
[09:29] that Bitcoin is a fraud it's because
[09:31] they you know didn't buy it early enough
[09:33] and now they don't want to buy it
[09:35] because they think it's a Ponzi scheme
[09:36] which is obviously not true because you
[09:39] know the price of Bitcoin is defined by
[09:42] demand and uh what's the other word Ang
[09:46] Supply supply and demand right so um you
[09:50] know it's it's it's not a Ponzi scheme
[09:52] it's something completely different and
[09:55] um yeah so and how did you come up with
[09:58] with the whole idea of the
[10:00] book um so I at first I had a another
[10:05] idea to say there's one more thing and
[10:08] uh then I would you know make a short
[10:11] video about a fraud that just happened
[10:14] you know because the frauds happen all
[10:16] the time if it's bang fraud if it's
[10:18] fraud on the individual level you know
[10:20] every day you open up the news and you
[10:22] see another fraud another Ponzi scheme
[10:24] or whatever you know and my idea was to
[10:26] you know do a regular sh just about uh
[10:29] the frauds and but somehow then the idea
[10:33] for the book developed and um everything
[10:36] is a fraud except for Bitcoin the reason
[10:38] for that is that every person can be
[10:41] good and evil you know every person is
[10:43] good and evil and one factor that uh
[10:47] makes you more evil in the sense of the
[10:49] fraud that you you know steal the
[10:51] monetary energy of someone else is um
[10:54] that you get opportunities okay so
[10:57] people who get opportunities um tend to
[11:01] even if they are very good person tend
[11:03] to use the opportunity to gain a
[11:05] monetary benefit against other people in
[11:08] my book I use the example of a guy who's
[11:11] working at DHL and he brings you a
[11:13] package with a camera that you bought
[11:15] but you are not at home so he just puts
[11:18] the camera in front of your door ex you
[11:20] know normally he has to get a signature
[11:23] he doesn't he's just like putting it in
[11:24] front of the door you come home and you
[11:27] are a good person but now there's
[11:29] opportunity for you you know you take
[11:31] the you take the package with the camera
[11:33] you go inside and then you call them and
[11:36] say where's the package and then they
[11:38] say well we delivered it and you say
[11:41] well I didn't get it where is it prove
[11:44] it to me and they can't prove it because
[11:46] they didn't get the signature from you
[11:49] and so you will get the money back from
[11:51] an insurance right you're a smart guy
[11:54] you met you know you just got a camera
[11:57] for free which is kind of expensive for
[12:00] €1,200 that's a smart move you know
[12:03] that's kind of evil yeah I mean not evil
[12:05] but it's a you know some you get an
[12:07] opportunity and you do something bad and
[12:10] then you look at the financial system
[12:12] that we have which is governed by
[12:15] politicians who you know tend to use who
[12:19] are kind of the sort of people who use
[12:21] uh opportunities more often than others
[12:24] you know that's why they get this job
[12:26] and uh you know the Fiat monetary system
[12:30] where you can just uh you know take uh
[12:33] take credits you know like the
[12:35] governments do I mean they they sell um
[12:38] they sell bonds and take in money and
[12:40] that's the ultimate opportunity they can
[12:43] just print money out of thin air and
[12:45] that's the ultimate opportunity so no
[12:48] wonder that our whole society is you
[12:52] know um filled with fraud from the
[12:55] individual level to the governmental
[12:57] level and I believe that
[13:00] if you you know take away the um part
[13:02] with the opportunities in the monetary
[13:04] system you can change the world in many
[13:06] many good ways um and everybody is going
[13:10] to win from it so you know everything is
[13:14] a scam except for Bitcoin because
[13:15] Bitcoin offers no opportunities it's the
[13:17] same rules for everybody around the
[13:20] world is is uh for you inflation and
[13:23] money printing than like the the fraud
[13:26] that's on the biggest scale exactly
[13:28] exact exactly that's the point you know
[13:30] we act like it's totally normal that we
[13:33] have 2% inflation which is also a lie
[13:36] that's it's not two% like Lynn oron
[13:39] proves in her book it's more like 6.5%
[13:41] per year you know and uh it's it's like
[13:45] a it's like a hidden tax you don't get
[13:47] to vote for it you know it's like they
[13:50] they just take it from you and it's it's
[13:53] like legalized theft you know why don't
[13:56] we have a monetary system with 0%
[13:58] inflation because the government loves
[14:00] inflation because inflation makes their
[14:03] debt burden be become less and less
[14:06] because you know you have the cap
[14:08] capacity everybody has a battery you
[14:11] know with a positive part and a negative
[14:13] part like I can have a bank account with
[14:16] the 5,000 on it and I can have a credit
[14:18] card at the same time with minus €2,000
[14:21] on it and then you expand the monetary
[14:24] Supply the battery gets larger but the
[14:27] amount of money stays the same so in if
[14:30] I have uh like minus minus 2,000 EUR and
[14:35] the monetary uh you know the the
[14:38] capacity of the battery gets expanded
[14:40] it's in in relation is less now and
[14:44] that's what governments love and that's
[14:46] why real estate investments in
[14:48] combination with a credit is also a very
[14:50] smart way to become you know wealthy
[14:53] because you use the same you know you
[14:56] use inflation as uh wind to sale and if
[15:00] you save money on your bank account you
[15:02] have the same wind but it blows in your
[15:04] face and you get you don't get anything
[15:08] even if you get like 4% 5% of interest
[15:12] from from the bank where you put your
[15:13] money you know it's you don't get
[15:16] anything because the government takes it
[15:18] away from you and gives it to people who
[15:20] have real estate and to the government
[15:22] itself because they reduce the debt I I
[15:25] love the example with with the wind and
[15:28] for like some people they profit from
[15:31] that and and sale with the inflation and
[15:34] the the good people that like just want
[15:36] to do what's what's right they don't
[15:38] know better they're saving in Euros they
[15:41] saving in dollars and they're like oh
[15:43] I'm saving on my bank account and that's
[15:45] the only thing they're doing because uh
[15:47] they don't think that they're good
[15:49] enough for like having real estate
[15:50] having stocks having all those those
[15:52] assets they don't don't to get in depth
[15:54] which is a good thing like basically
[15:55] like if you don't want to get in depth
[15:57] you have a good mindset but it's in the
[16:00] you're in the wrong system for that you
[16:01] have to be in the Bitcoin system and not
[16:03] in the field system because if you're in
[16:04] the field system and you want to save
[16:06] and you don't want to use depth system
[16:08] you actually get screwed all the time so
[16:11] then your the wind that actually should
[16:14] enhance you because you're a good person
[16:16] actually blows in your face and the the
[16:18] bad person that actually uses that to
[16:20] their advantage they get the the
[16:22] advantage from that I love that example
[16:25] a lot um the only question that I have
[16:28] with that is like like why don't they
[16:30] notice their wind in their face like why
[16:33] they don't just like turn around and and
[16:35] use the wind with Bitcoin and and is is
[16:38] the pain still not high enough because
[16:42] it's a fraud and they get a reality that
[16:45] isn't there and they believe that
[16:48] reality and um you know people know it
[16:51] people feel it but it's it's not very
[16:54] obvious that's why it's a fraud you know
[16:56] it's not very obvious because the the
[16:58] tech know advantage that we have you
[17:01] know technology is making everything
[17:03] cheaper so you know you don't feel the
[17:06] the amount of inflation that and the
[17:08] amount of money printing that the
[17:10] government is using you don't feel it
[17:12] that much but it's kind of there you
[17:14] know and um so people really um have to
[17:19] you know uh learn about it and most
[17:22] people don't because they are too busy
[17:25] you know the the inflation kind of thing
[17:28] they take away money from you and you
[17:30] you kind of feel it but you don't know
[17:31] where it's coming from but you always
[17:34] feel the shoe on your face you know like
[17:36] BM BM bum and you you try try to swim
[17:39] and nobody's you know you try to swim
[17:42] stay above the water and just you know
[17:45] get the get the air you try to get the
[17:46] next job you try to save money here and
[17:49] in the meantime someone is trying to
[17:51] push you down and then you don't have
[17:54] you are too busy swimming and staying
[17:56] above the
[17:57] waterline then then you don't have time
[18:00] to think about inflation and think about
[18:02] the guy who's putting the shoe on you to
[18:04] push you down the water you know so I
[18:07] don't know uh some some people won't
[18:10] notice it and but hopefully we can uh
[18:13] wake some people up and in the meantime
[18:15] people are angry you know I love the the
[18:18] Claus Schwab thing you know we both are
[18:21] German speakers you know and I think we
[18:23] do a much better job than CL but he's
[18:25] like people will be very angry it's an
[18:28] angry PR you have to prepare for this
[18:30] world and why are people angry because
[18:33] they are so busy you know not drowning
[18:36] and then they are angry at each other
[18:38] and not at the guy who's putting the
[18:39] shoe on their on their
[18:41] neck do do you think that that that
[18:44] fraud will uh continue like I have a the
[18:48] more I'm in Bitcoin the more bullish I
[18:51] get about Bitcoin but the more I also
[18:53] understand what strong Network effect
[18:56] that feat system has like the the people
[18:58] are so embedded in the system and even
[19:02] young people with 15 16 years old even a
[19:05] lot of them are really embedded already
[19:07] in that field system because they get it
[19:09] from their parents they get it from the
[19:10] media they get it from everyone so it's
[19:12] such a big fraud um and it's so embedded
[19:16] in the system that even like a lot of
[19:18] people that work for that fraud they
[19:21] think it's a good thing it's like I
[19:24] don't know how many people actually in
[19:25] the Fiat system they work for the Fiat
[19:27] system they work maybe for a bank work
[19:28] for a central bank even recognized like
[19:31] I don't think that most people are evil
[19:33] I think they're just the system grew
[19:35] over time and now they're working there
[19:37] and they don't even realize uh What uh
[19:40] um major evil things they're doing um is
[19:45] H how do we get rid of like is is
[19:47] Bitcoin actually getting rid of that fat
[19:49] system do we have a chance of uh en
[19:52] rooting that and and and putting an end
[19:54] to to that major fraud or is is that
[19:57] always uh government issued money uh
[20:00] always a thing or maybe can it be backed
[20:02] with
[20:03] Bitcoin so I think opportunity makes the
[20:06] theft and um people who believe that uh
[20:09] the Fiat monetary system is a good thing
[20:12] um believe in the government and the
[20:14] government is not corrupt you know which
[20:16] is obviously very naive because the
[20:19] government is also
[20:20] only you know a team of people and
[20:24] people are tend to use the opportunity
[20:27] that's offered to them and you know the
[20:29] more power you get the more corrupt you
[20:31] get it's a famous quote I don't know
[20:34] exactly the words but you know everybody
[20:36] knows it you know power corrupts and
[20:38] absolute power corrupts absolutely you
[20:41] know yeah and so um people who believe
[20:44] that the Fiat system has also benefits
[20:48] for society you know because I heard the
[20:50] argument that the depth of the
[20:52] government that gets reduced when you
[20:55] expand the capacity of the battery you
[20:57] know we all win from from it because we
[20:59] are all the government isn't that great
[21:01] we all profit from it well yeah um so in
[21:06] my opinion U I think Bitcoin can also be
[21:10] a chance for the Fiat monetary system to
[21:13] you know live a little bit longer um and
[21:16] I think a great future would be um
[21:19] because the problem with Bitcoin is it's
[21:22] a good problem listen to me Bitcoin is
[21:25] CT at 21 million okay and the technology
[21:29] advantage of the world is getting faster
[21:32] and faster the available usable and
[21:35] monetizable energy that we use as a
[21:38] world societies getting bigger and
[21:40] bigger and bigger and therefore the
[21:42] price of Bitcoin is going to rise ever
[21:45] and ever and ever and you have to have
[21:48] one thing if you want a stable currency
[21:51] you need a stability and Bitcoin doesn't
[21:54] have that because it's going up forever
[21:57] okay and uh um so in my opinion what
[22:00] would make sense until we are all so
[22:03] rich that money doesn't matter anymore
[22:05] which is also
[22:07] possible it would make sense to use a
[22:09] fiat currency like Euro or dollars uh
[22:12] and back it with Bitcoin and I would
[22:15] like to see that on on the lightning
[22:17] Network I don't know I heard someone say
[22:19] that it already exists but I didn't
[22:21] Discover it yet but I think that could
[22:24] be a a future so we have a stable unit
[22:27] of account and you have but you have the
[22:30] total limit of um amount of Bitcoin that
[22:34] exist and it can save endless amounts of
[22:38] monetary energy which is
[22:42] remarkable um which for me it's also the
[22:45] book really interesting because you have
[22:47] to to basically make two messages clear
[22:49] like why everything is a a fraud and the
[22:53] other thing is like uh why Bitcoin is
[22:56] not and why Bitcoin is great what was
[22:58] the more like with what did you struggle
[23:00] more explaining is it is Bitcoin is it
[23:03] harder to wake up people to the fraud or
[23:05] is it easier to like or it harder to to
[23:08] explain Bitcoin to
[23:10] people um I tried to explain the society
[23:14] first that we are living in because it's
[23:17] uh sometimes really hard to you know I I
[23:20] feel like we live in a in an age of
[23:22] information Warfare you know and most
[23:25] people are not able to take the time
[23:28] because the guy is standing on their
[23:30] shoulders and they are kind of drawing
[23:33] but most people don't have the time to
[23:34] go and watch a hearing in the United
[23:36] States you know because it's all streams
[23:38] you can watch the whole thing but they
[23:41] don't have the time for that so they
[23:42] take the news article they get about it
[23:45] which is just a derivative of that and
[23:48] they they they read it and they be like
[23:50] ah okay now I'm informed now I know what
[23:52] happened and they start to build their
[23:54] reality upon that okay and um the
[23:57] problem is that this news article is not
[24:00] it's not fair it's not you know um it it
[24:04] it contains a reality that someone else
[24:06] wants to present to you and you feel you
[24:09] don't recognize that so you start to
[24:11] build your own reality um with the with
[24:14] these blocks of information that you
[24:16] receive from other people not directly
[24:18] from the source and um you know it's
[24:21] very hard
[24:23] to make people understand that they
[24:25] built a a reality because it becomes
[24:28] part of their identity and if you say to
[24:31] them things that are actually true but
[24:33] they have different information they
[24:35] kind of get
[24:37] emotional you know if if someone tells
[24:39] me something about I don't
[24:43] know that really shakes my um shakes my
[24:47] reality then I might also get very
[24:49] emotional and um you know the Fiat fat
[24:53] money is also some kind of religion you
[24:57] know and uh and it's it's it's part of
[24:59] your identity and that's why some
[25:01] experts Finance experts become uh very
[25:04] emotional when when because Bitcoin is
[25:06] like a paradigm shift and they are
[25:09] entrenched in this Fiat world and they
[25:11] know exactly what's going on and now
[25:14] they really it's part of their identity
[25:16] and now they they see this new thing and
[25:19] they be like no that's impossible you
[25:21] know this is my identity I can't change
[25:24] it's very you know the hardest thing a
[25:25] human can do is to change you know do
[25:28] you think that I mean I I love to be on
[25:31] your podcast don't don't misunderstand
[25:33] me but do you think that you know I
[25:35] wrote the book and I have to do this I
[25:37] don't want to do this I don't want to be
[25:39] here you know but I have to do it
[25:41] because nobody else is going to do it
[25:43] and I love Bitcoin too much to not do it
[25:46] and um
[25:49] yeah
[25:53] so I love it a lot but it seems a lot
[25:55] like um when we go to uh critical
[25:59] thinking like I feel like we have a
[26:00] critical thinking crisis we have to like
[26:03] really start critical thinking again um
[26:08] is is it possible that with Bitcoin
[26:12] nothing really changed because um there
[26:14] are a few select people that actually
[26:16] think critical about everything and they
[26:19] are awaken and they they see it and they
[26:21] will benefit from it but the masses are
[26:23] asleep and they will get into like some
[26:25] other fear fraud that someone's been up
[26:28] is is is that some some possibility for
[26:30] you no impossible because um the more
[26:34] you manipulate you know if you get paid
[26:37] from someone who says that I don't know
[26:39] the climate change is caused by
[26:42] CO2 you your whole life depends on it
[26:45] and you do the studies and you get all
[26:47] the money from them where do they get
[26:49] the money from they get it from the
[26:51] money printer mostly they get it from
[26:53] this corrupt system and the more money
[26:56] they print from now on the higher the
[26:57] price of Bitcoin is going to get and
[26:59] will take away this this power and give
[27:02] it to critical thinkers like you and me
[27:04] and other bitcoiners you know who try
[27:07] it's it's very difficult but who try to
[27:08] see the world as it is who try to make
[27:11] critical thinking and uh you know are
[27:14] not um so um deceptive for this this
[27:19] kind of um corruption you know that's
[27:22] going that's going on in the society
[27:24] Bitcoin is taking away this power to
[27:27] corrupt the society and you know make
[27:30] create realities that are debatable
[27:34] right thank you you already made it Happ
[27:36] through the video and I'm really really
[27:38] grateful to have you here two things
[27:40] make this channel possible you as a
[27:42] watcher and listener who keep supporting
[27:45] this Channel and another one is all the
[27:47] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[27:49] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[27:52] very start and where I personally buy my
[27:54] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[27:56] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[27:58] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[28:01] simplest and securest way to secure your
[28:05] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[28:07] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[28:10] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[28:12] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[28:15] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[28:18] and you know your friend does not have
[28:20] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[28:21] he needs a birth of present and a small
[28:24] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[28:26] 5% off your order plus you support my
[28:29] channel and now let's get back to the
[28:31] video and and and and for you you
[28:33] described it I think in the beginning
[28:35] for you 2020 like the uh the the
[28:38] pandemic was for you the the wakeup
[28:40] moment right so so did you had before
[28:43] this this fear mindset with like
[28:44] inflation is good the government is good
[28:47] or did you were already critical before
[28:49] the 2020
[28:52] crisis I wouldn't say that I was that
[28:54] critical i al already knew that
[28:56] inflation had you know haded certain
[28:59] rules and I Tred to you know become a
[29:03] real estate guy you know which is not
[29:06] which is not easy because it's very
[29:08] expensive in the
[29:09] beginning um but actually it started a
[29:13] little bit earlier I mean everybody
[29:15] knows 911 was a little bit H you know
[29:18] that it's kind of on Shaky Ground all
[29:21] the information that we get about it is
[29:23] kind of ah I don't know if that's really
[29:25] 100% true what the government says about
[29:27] it maybe
[29:28] you know something else also happened
[29:31] and um and then I was watching the
[29:34] hearings uh from U from Donald Trump's
[29:39] um you know Robert Miller the Robert
[29:41] Miller hearings and I was watching the
[29:44] whole thing because I was interested in
[29:46] how corrupt Donald Trump is you know and
[29:49] the more I watched it the more confused
[29:51] I got and then I was uh you know reading
[29:53] the newspaper in Germany or watching the
[29:55] news and they said something that has
[29:58] had nothing to do with what I
[30:00] experienced when I was listening to this
[30:01] hearings you know I don't want to say
[30:04] Trump is good or bad or whatever you
[30:05] know I don't care actually but uh I just
[30:08] noticed this information kind of thing
[30:11] that was going on and then during the
[30:14] pandemic they had you know the money
[30:16] printing of course I was it was like
[30:18] okay this they are going to print a lot
[30:20] of money because they think it's the
[30:21] solution to to everything and um yeah
[30:25] and then the whole um you know injection
[30:28] kind of thing and at first I also
[30:31] thought maybe it's a good idea to you
[30:33] know get these injections uh you know
[30:35] why not maybe I can help others with
[30:37] that and stuff all this propaganda that
[30:40] they put out in that time and the more I
[30:43] waited um the less I wanted to get a
[30:46] shot right because I was like why are
[30:49] politicians pushing people so hard to
[30:52] get these injections it's kind of weird
[30:54] man and it kind of you know threw me
[30:56] back and and then more and more
[30:59] information came out about especially
[31:01] the corruption of the you know farmer
[31:03] industry which is also a big part of my
[31:05] book and my test readers were like well
[31:07] you should do this part a little bit
[31:09] shorter because it's so corrupt then I
[31:11] had such a long you know Capital about
[31:13] it chapter and I really shortened it
[31:16] down to to a good level but um you know
[31:20] the companies uh that sold us this
[31:22] injection uh actually sold also
[31:25] different products before that long
[31:27] before that of which they knew and it
[31:29] was proven and they paid for that it was
[31:32] proven that they knew that they were
[31:34] killing their customers with it okay and
[31:38] uh you
[31:39] know it's also um very very frightening
[31:43] kind of and I think this whole um Power
[31:47] that they were pushing so much is
[31:50] because they have the power over the
[31:51] Monti printer money printer and I think
[31:55] maybe it was Peak it was Peak Fiat
[31:58] and now we are you know this whole thing
[32:01] woke up a lot of people and some people
[32:04] made found their way into the Bitcoin
[32:06] rabbit hole which is awesome um but
[32:09] other people also just got a lot more
[32:11] skeptical about everything that you know
[32:14] comes from from the side of the
[32:16] governments and are wondering if they
[32:18] lie to about to us about this which is
[32:21] very important you know important and
[32:24] lifechanging for a lot of people you
[32:26] know shutting down business
[32:28] and you know forcing Mas on children
[32:30] even though they knew that Mas don't
[32:32] really have you know any use case um you
[32:36] know that's really shook up a lot of
[32:38] people and um I think once they once
[32:41] more people fall into the Bitcoin Revit
[32:43] hole this would change uh the world
[32:45] dramatically because the world is made
[32:47] up of individuals and Bitcoin gives you
[32:49] a lot more control over your own life
[32:52] because if you spoke out against the
[32:54] pandemic uh politi politics you know
[32:58] they just uh were able to shut your bank
[33:01] account down and then you were like okay
[33:03] and and this made a lot of people be
[33:06] quiet you know it's like they saw what
[33:08] happened to other people who spoke up
[33:09] and they be like I don't want to I don't
[33:11] want you to have anything to do with it
[33:13] you know so they were like I'm just
[33:15] going along it's okay and I understand
[33:16] that because it was really scary and
[33:19] it's still not over and I I this whole
[33:21] pandemic uh subject is not a part of my
[33:24] book because it's all still very open
[33:27] and not uh not sufficiently um discussed
[33:31] in society yet it will take some more
[33:33] years to U you know so we come out at
[33:36] the other side and still have a
[33:38] democracy still have a working Society
[33:41] um yeah but
[33:44] uh yeah do you think we have now uh a
[33:48] working society and a working
[33:52] democracy uh yes but it's on the edge I
[33:54] would say you know I think which is
[33:57] interesting is we are on the side of the
[33:59] decentralized world and YouTube and meta
[34:04] Al Instagram and uh and they are on the
[34:08] side of the centralized world but we
[34:10] still have to use them to get more
[34:14] people on the other side and you know
[34:16] once people are know that they have
[34:18] their Bitcoin on their own wallet and
[34:21] they can leave the country and at any
[34:22] time they will be able to speak out
[34:25] against corruption and um you know they
[34:28] will have more um braveness they will be
[34:31] braver because they are free and the
[34:35] government hates that they hate it but
[34:37] they can't stop it and which is so nice
[34:39] to see it in in America how you know
[34:43] Bitcoin becomes such a political uh
[34:45] subject that Donald Trump Embraces
[34:48] Bitcoin it's like let's mine all the
[34:51] remaining Bitcoin In America which is
[34:52] also nonsense but you know that's
[34:55] typical Trump sentence and now Joe Biden
[34:58] comes along well Joe Biden and his
[35:00] handlers you know comes along and uh
[35:03] says yeah maybe we should also accept
[35:05] cryptocurrencies as donations you know
[35:07] and n they will have a meeting now with
[35:09] the Bitcoin Miners and you know it's um
[35:13] it's it's a way that they cannot stop
[35:15] anymore and it's it's the peaceful
[35:17] Revolution from a decentralized system
[35:20] against a centralized system which is
[35:24] corrupt it's fascinating for me how this
[35:26] whole thing sh out because America
[35:28] already has it as an uh as a topic and
[35:32] EU election I followed some of the
[35:34] debates because I was curious what
[35:35] topics they are discussing I was really
[35:37] not curious about what they're saying to
[35:39] the topics but I was really curious like
[35:41] what are they discussing and there was
[35:44] no talk of like how can we stop
[35:47] inflation there was no talk of like uh
[35:50] how can we uh Embrace cryptocurrencies
[35:53] Bitcoin like nothing even close to that
[35:56] I would be like if someone said the word
[35:58] crypto I would be really satisfied
[36:00] honestly and I'm like a Bitcoin I don't
[36:02] want to hear crypto too much I only want
[36:04] to hear Bitcoin but if a politician says
[36:07] like crypto then he is like a little bit
[36:09] closer to to that and nobody like one
[36:13] guy said once in Austria oh we have to
[36:16] return to to hard money and he was not
[36:18] referring to bitcoin not referring to
[36:20] Gold he was referring to the old fiat
[36:22] currency we used before in Austria which
[36:25] was better than the Euro but not this
[36:28] was not a hard not a real hard currency
[36:30] like gold or
[36:32] Bitcoin yeah so that's that's uh that's
[36:35] un very was very sad for me in the
[36:38] European election uh that the topics
[36:40] were just like not not on target it was
[36:44] not at least a little bit of a topic
[36:47] Bitcoin should have been as it is in
[36:50] America it doesn't has to be the main
[36:52] one I understand that in politics right
[36:54] now war in Ukraine is a big one it's not
[36:57] that big for for myself but a lot of
[37:00] people actually have concerns and yeah
[37:02] politics should address it it should be
[37:04] one topic but it should not the be the
[37:06] only topic so um it's interesting for me
[37:09] how do you see actually like Game Theory
[37:11] right now playing out when we have
[37:13] America seemingly seemingly actually
[37:17] again leading the way European is like
[37:19] there's this uh this this nice L like
[37:22] America innovates China copies and then
[37:25] European uh Union drives to regulate
[37:28] everything uh it seems to happen also
[37:31] again with Bitcoin how do you see it
[37:33] with the game theory it's the typical
[37:35] roles I mean United States of America is
[37:38] always like five to 10 years ahead of
[37:41] everybody else uh when it comes to
[37:44] technology and things like that yeah and
[37:47] I mean you nailed it you know the
[37:49] Europeans love to regulate it and the
[37:51] Chinese people have to ban it you know
[37:54] and then they have to embrace it anyways
[37:56] which they also do
[37:58] um I mean I'm I'm not an expert in Game
[38:00] Theory um but it's kind of obvious that
[38:03] it seems to play out right now in front
[38:06] of our eyes and still people are kind of
[38:09] um doubting Bitcoin it's so funny you
[38:11] know I have uh friends who really you
[38:15] know they they are they don't want to
[38:18] own Bitcoin not even a little bit
[38:21] because they still don't trust it and
[38:24] then you have about people like uh you
[38:26] know uh
[38:28] um Larry fing from Black Rock who says
[38:31] Bitcoin is digital God right and um gold
[38:36] has a market cap of 15 billion and
[38:39] Bitcoin has a market cap of 1.5 billion
[38:42] so if Bitcoin is digital gold it must be
[38:45] at least as good as the the old kind of
[38:48] gold right so it should do a 10x from
[38:52] here but they you know they they still I
[38:56] don't know they still don't uh are not
[38:58] open to that um but at some point they
[39:02] will have to understand it and you know
[39:04] if now the game theory plays out and at
[39:07] some point I know they will maybe ask me
[39:10] about it
[39:11] hopefully definitely definitely um in
[39:14] the last part part of the podcast I
[39:16] really want to dive a little bit also in
[39:18] in the writing process in there uh was
[39:21] it your first book that you wrote yes so
[39:24] I'm actually a dyslexic and um uh
[39:28] I don't know what happened but you know
[39:30] I um I I just started writing at first I
[39:33] did a mind map I used mirro.com I think
[39:37] it is and then I was just like diving
[39:39] into the subject what's the what's what
[39:41] ideas do I have you know what what's the
[39:43] line which combinations are there and um
[39:47] and then I knew that I had to start with
[39:49] problems first of all and then uh you
[39:53] you do this solution in the end of the
[39:54] book that's uh you know that's very
[39:57] important if you want to um if you write
[39:59] a book and you would put the solution in
[40:01] the beginning and the problems in the
[40:02] end then nobody's going to read it
[40:04] because you know I don't know because
[40:05] they they don't want to read about the
[40:07] solution they want at first to read
[40:09] about the problems okay um and this I
[40:13] learned from Herman Shir it's a German
[40:15] uh speaker is a very nice uh
[40:18] inspirational Guy and um well I don't
[40:22] know it's like the the process of
[40:24] writing I just started and I um and and
[40:30] during the process uh some things
[40:32] changed because I I was starting with
[40:34] frauds from the individual level to the
[40:36] governmental level and then I wanted to
[40:39] pinpoint to inflation as the Bigg
[40:41] biggest fraud of all of them but then I
[40:44] switched it and I put a chapter to
[40:47] explain Banks how fraudulent banks are
[40:50] and then I explained in in the
[40:51] combination Bitcoin you know banks are
[40:54] the the business of um Trust and Bitcoin
[40:58] is the technology of Truth you know what
[41:01] what do you prefer Trust of a system
[41:03] that's corrupt obviously which which can
[41:06] be proven or do you want to use
[41:08] technology that is provably the truth
[41:11] because you know every 10 minutes you
[41:13] create a block and it's a blockchain
[41:15] that cannot be changed it's it's the
[41:17] truth it's information um and then after
[41:20] that I started uh with with inflation so
[41:23] during the writing process some things
[41:25] changed you know but uh yeah so that was
[41:28] the the process and at some point I also
[41:31] was like oh man this is too much for me
[41:33] I I think I can't can't do it and then I
[41:37] I kind of uh you know I also wrote like
[41:39] 40 pages that I completely threw out
[41:42] during the proess I was like I don't
[41:44] know it kind of doesn't fit in U maybe
[41:46] it's a little bit too
[41:48] conspir conspiratorial you know and um I
[41:52] just threw it out and um yeah but I I
[41:55] kind of made it over the hump and um and
[42:01] and then I was like the the straight
[42:04] line I just I just knew I had to finish
[42:06] the to the line and I knew I can make it
[42:08] and then I was yeah really happy I wrote
[42:11] nine months and then I uh went to
[42:14] Twitter and said hey I guys I wrote a
[42:17] book who wants to test read it because
[42:19] if you write a book it's most important
[42:22] that you find test readers because the
[42:25] feedback you get is very valuable and um
[42:29] as I told you I just really had to you
[42:31] know put half of the farmer uh chapter
[42:35] out because people said it's too long
[42:38] okay and um so it's very valuable to
[42:42] find test
[42:43] readers and um and then I had to like
[42:46] six months of additional work to you
[42:49] know I had a I don't know how how it's
[42:52] called in English but electorat and
[42:54] corat so there someone who reads
[42:56] everything thing is a professional and
[42:59] says well you should change the sentence
[43:01] to this and maybe you should use a
[43:02] different word here and then the correct
[43:04] is like U putting all the um words in
[43:07] correct writing uh and all the you know
[43:10] quotes and stuff and yeah and then you
[43:13] have to do the inner design of the book
[43:16] it's also an an additional
[43:20] process you know and the cover design so
[43:22] much work but um and then but I think
[43:26] it's brilliant that nowadays anybody can
[43:28] write a book and you can um then publish
[43:31] it on your own using different platforms
[43:35] like bod is from Amazon uh no KDP is
[43:38] from Amazon and then there's BD books on
[43:41] demand and it works like uh print on
[43:44] demand so if you order my book and they
[43:47] print it especially just for you so
[43:50] there's no storage of the books um and
[43:53] it makes the process very lean and um
[43:58] easy and yeah it's it's very nice
[44:02] yeah was there at some point the point
[44:05] where like ah it I don't want to
[44:07] write this book because nine months uh
[44:09] it's like a very long process and the
[44:12] book is interesting because you write
[44:14] very long uh and then in the end you you
[44:17] never know like do even people like do
[44:19] even people read it uh so it's
[44:22] like very very a lot of hours where you
[44:26] never get feedback for me for the
[44:28] podcast I just started out put the first
[44:30] podcast episode out so I get constantly
[44:32] feedback oh that's good that's bad so
[44:34] it's like I write a long book with
[44:36] podcast like kind of like reading like
[44:39] writing a book uh and I always get
[44:42] feedback and from that I can really like
[44:45] every hour every five hours I put in a
[44:48] in a podcast episode because average for
[44:50] one podcast episode I need five hours so
[44:52] put like five hours of work out there
[44:54] then I get feedback how did people like
[44:57] like that podcast episode and for the
[44:58] next podcast episode I can even like in
[45:01] ingrain that feedback already but a book
[45:03] is a little bit different of course you
[45:04] could like also release an articles on
[45:07] one specific chapter and then release
[45:10] like the book in in in in in steps
[45:13] friend of mine Daniel white actually
[45:15] does it like that he's now writing a
[45:18] book in real time on medium and writing
[45:21] chapter after chapter and also like
[45:23] rewriting and he gets a lot of feedback
[45:25] from the community for that it's an
[45:26] interesting concept to write a book like
[45:29] that uh but was there ever a point where
[45:32] like ah I don't know like n months it's
[45:34] it's too long uh let's let's throw it
[45:36] away uh when I started to do this I
[45:39] didn't know how much time it will take
[45:42] me and um but during the process I also
[45:47] knew that this is going to be a good
[45:50] good book I knew it and um I think the
[45:55] feedback from the test readers was very
[45:58] um positive and uh and but they also
[46:02] gave feedback that so I could even
[46:04] increase the quality even more and um
[46:08] but I don't know man you know there's so
[46:10] much I'm actually super angry even
[46:13] though I appear to be very friendly I
[46:15] hope you know but I'm super angry to be
[46:19] honest and I I put a lot of this anger
[46:22] into the book and it's a creative outlet
[46:25] for me and I I know that and and I knew
[46:29] during the writing I knew this is good
[46:31] and I knew this is a punch in the face
[46:33] of people who are corrupt you know and
[46:37] uh hopefully it um is entertaining also
[46:39] this my my angle I try to also entertain
[46:43] and try to you know put a joke in here
[46:45] and there you know to make fun of the uh
[46:47] corrupt people in our society um so yeah
[46:53] um I know you know I was like
[46:57] I I knew that it was good but at the
[46:59] point where I was it was like six months
[47:01] in and then I was a little bit um you
[47:04] know maybe off off off the path and I
[47:08] had too many roads that I could take and
[47:12] um and that was a little bit um what was
[47:15] that and it was a little bit uh uh you
[47:19] know um I had to decide which rich road
[47:22] I will take now and um but once I
[47:25] decided it if was uh it was a clear path
[47:28] forward
[47:29] and yeah I I think it's a very
[47:32] interesting way to you know write
[47:34] article article article or chapter
[47:37] chapter chapter and and then get
[47:38] feedback instantly but also I think if
[47:41] you if if you write a book um you try to
[47:45] you know create a bow from the beginning
[47:48] to the end and during this process you
[47:51] try to you know get the um reader up to
[47:56] a new level of understanding and this is
[47:58] what I love about books and that's why I
[48:00] don't like for example uh blinket
[48:03] blinkist you know this app where you get
[48:05] the whole content in 50 minute summary
[48:07] because it's a derivative it's it's just
[48:09] like I Tau you about if you watch the
[48:11] hearing or if you read the newsletter
[48:13] about it I mean it's just blink is just
[48:16] the information okay but you don't get
[48:19] in the connection and the humor of the
[48:22] auor who tries to open open up your mind
[48:25] for a new understanding of a new view of
[48:29] the word and um so I think it's very
[48:32] hard for test readers who read uh
[48:35] chapter by chapter only and not the
[48:37] whole thing through to see this uh this
[48:41] you know bow of attention uh that you
[48:45] try to create is the author of a book
[48:47] right so but there are different kinds
[48:49] of books so you know for example tools
[48:51] of Titans which we also already talked
[48:54] about it's not that he you know he has a
[48:57] very clear format but it's Al only
[49:00] podcast interviews um and he just takes
[49:03] the most uh valuable information from
[49:06] these podcast interviews and you can
[49:08] read just one podcast interview after
[49:11] another but you don't have to read the
[49:12] whole thing through you know you can
[49:14] also just skip some chapters and it's a
[49:17] different kind of a book um you know
[49:19] maybe your friend is working on a on a
[49:21] book like that and then it makes a lot
[49:24] of sense to get you know the direct
[49:27] feedback from yeah that would be also
[49:30] interesting because we talked about that
[49:32] because I'm in the process of also of
[49:34] making the podcast I think I told it on
[49:36] the podcast already like two three times
[49:37] that I think of writing a book I'm like
[49:40] coming closer and closer to the idea I
[49:42] have like a big Google Docs document
[49:44] where I'm like trying to figure out how
[49:46] to do it and I have like 20 different
[49:47] directions I can go through and you
[49:49] actually made a really good um
[49:51] suggestion to me to make a book about
[49:54] Bitcoin about my podcast similar than
[49:57] what Tim Ferris did and I actually
[50:00] researched yesterday when I was on a
[50:01] train about that book because I just
[50:03] didn't knew about it and I love that
[50:05] format I will do it a little bit
[50:08] different I think like I have some some
[50:11] things where I could do it differently
[50:12] and I even thought about um categorizing
[50:16] my podcast in different categories
[50:19] because sometimes we talk about self
[50:20] custody sometimes we talk about
[50:22] philosophy some more about economics so
[50:24] there are like different uh things about
[50:26] it maybe I just like start with one
[50:28] thing and make a smaller book about that
[50:31] and make like my first book around that
[50:33] topic and maybe just like choose like 50
[50:36] podcast episodes from that and make
[50:38] around that one book about one topic uh
[50:41] and give examples of that uh which yeah
[50:44] I had a lot of thoughts about that but
[50:45] yeah I'm doing it really publicly I'm
[50:48] talking to a lot of people about the
[50:49] book uh as I always do everything really
[50:52] publicly so like if someone steals my
[50:54] ideas it's totally fine for me it's like
[50:56] I was Auto steal only for other people
[50:58] and like I think the the thought of like
[51:00] original thoughts it's like you put you
[51:03] put two and three things together into
[51:05] your own thing and that's called
[51:06] Original FS
[51:08] like there's always some quotes to that
[51:10] so there's always somewhere where you
[51:12] got the idea from uh so I'm doing it as
[51:15] always very transparen and very publicly
[51:18] uh but I thought about either making
[51:20] small articles and then maybe put the
[51:23] whole thing in in one book or like
[51:25] actually making smaller books around
[51:26] that uh but yeah at some point they will
[51:28] come come book out of that the only
[51:30] thing I'm really bad in writing uh but
[51:33] as you also said like uh you also did
[51:35] not thought that you write a book and
[51:36] you have dyslexia it's like um gives me
[51:39] a lot of hope that I might also be able
[51:41] to write a book because I'm not that
[51:43] good at writing I'm really bad actually
[51:45] yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm I'm happy to
[51:48] hear that it's you know maybe a little
[51:50] bit inspiring for you uh to know about
[51:53] the book to of titles I I can also
[51:55] recommend it to everybody it's a very
[51:58] helpful book you get a lot of advice
[52:00] from experts um yeah that's very nice
[52:04] and also I offered you already if you
[52:07] need any advice um I know a lot some
[52:11] things now that could maybe guide you a
[52:14] little bit
[52:16] Yeah amazing thank you uh for for the
[52:19] for the ideas and now coming closer to
[52:21] the end of the podcast we're coming to
[52:23] this one hour mark where I'm usually
[52:25] getting aing for for a podcast episode I
[52:28] think this is like it's like if you do
[52:30] everyday a podcast one hour it's already
[52:32] a lot for for people to consume but one
[52:35] hour is always a great great great Mark
[52:38] um and the question that I always ask
[52:40] before the actual end routine is what
[52:42] are you currently passionate about or
[52:44] deeply learning about which has nothing
[52:46] to do with
[52:48] Bitcoin
[52:49] um currently I'm learning to do
[52:52] marketing and uh you know for my book uh
[52:55] I'm actually
[52:59] um I would say like how do you say that
[53:02] I'm you're constantly overwhelmed with
[53:04] the with the process of marketing yeah
[53:07] exactly not only the marketing the whole
[53:08] process I was I'm overwhelmed uh all the
[53:11] time and I think that's a good thing
[53:13] because if you're not overwhelmed every
[53:15] day you with what you have to do during
[53:18] the day I think you don't do enough
[53:20] process to you know get get somewhere
[53:22] you know because uh it's a lot of work
[53:26] and and um but I think what's also
[53:29] interesting currently to me and which I
[53:31] want to study a little bit more is uh
[53:33] the banner cycle I don't know if you
[53:34] heard about it um it's uh Samuel Benner
[53:38] wrote a book about it and he analyzes uh
[53:41] cycles of price uh development and the
[53:44] book is I think from
[53:46] 1790 something it's very old the book
[53:49] and Samuel Banner actually lost a lot of
[53:52] money because he was a farmer and he
[53:55] didn't understand why because his
[53:56] product was great and then he started
[53:58] price cycles and price developments and
[54:02] uh you know he he created this price
[54:05] cycle where you have to buy where you
[54:07] have to sell and when panics appear and
[54:11] um interestingly for example the 2000
[54:15] crisis he forecasted that and also the
[54:18] big financial crisis which is 2000 and
[54:21] 2008 right so and also I think 2020 he
[54:26] also predicted that there's something
[54:27] like a crash also and uh which is kind
[54:30] of crazy you know it's a it's a book you
[54:32] can pro project this into the future
[54:35] because he focuses on uh uh actually on
[54:39] how the Sun and how the planet the the
[54:41] Earth is you know revolving around the
[54:43] Sun and that's how uh that's why crops
[54:47] grow or don't grow as good and that's
[54:50] why prices are created because of uh you
[54:54] know supply and demand and it's very
[54:57] interesting and I think I'm going to
[54:58] study this a little bit more if I have
[55:01] some
[55:02] time yeah I think what you said in the
[55:05] beginning I also feel like that
[55:07] sometimes I think when you don't feel
[55:10] overwhelmed you don't push hard enough
[55:12] like if you really wna grow and you
[55:14] really want to achieve something you
[55:17] constantly have to feel overwhelmed with
[55:19] it you constantly have to be in like a
[55:21] position where you even feel a little
[55:23] bit like an impostor you're like oh why
[55:25] I that in in that position so uh if if
[55:28] you don't have that you don't push hard
[55:30] enough uh and it's like just let it's
[55:34] it's hard to Pro to enjoy the whole
[55:35] process of it uh and and I I try to do
[55:38] that and then I I I really enjoy like
[55:41] maybe making the the interview with
[55:43] Michael S and stuff like that but when
[55:44] you sit there and you actually hear him
[55:46] talking and he's just like one feet away
[55:48] from you and then he's he's that one guy
[55:50] that you always watched on TV and when
[55:52] you got orange build and all of a sudden
[55:53] he speaks with you and you forget like
[55:55] oh I'm the interviewer here uh that's
[55:57] like imposter syndrome times 10 uh but
[56:01] but like I think if if you don't have
[56:03] that you don't push hard enough and I'm
[56:05] really thankful and enjoy the the
[56:07] situation a lot I don't know if this is
[56:09] also the the feeling that you described
[56:11] yeah exactly and uh it's also kind of
[56:13] honoring for me you know two days ago
[56:15] you interviewed Michael saor and now you
[56:18] interview me it's kind of you know it's
[56:20] very humbling and uh you know uh
[56:24] sometimes it's very important to not
[56:25] take yourself to seriously you know uh
[56:28] you have to stand most people stand in
[56:31] their own way they they decide not to do
[56:35] something because they tell themselves I
[56:38] don't I don't I can't do that I you know
[56:40] I'm not able to do this and it's not
[56:43] true don't believe yourself don't take
[56:44] yourself too seriously take the phone
[56:47] and call someone and do the thing that
[56:49] you wanted to do and you can only do
[56:51] something in combination with other
[56:53] people if you like me write a lot of
[56:56] good songs but never release them
[56:57] nothing's going to happen Okay so you
[56:59] have to work outside also and don't take
[57:01] yourself too
[57:03] seriously uh very very good I think this
[57:05] is a good end uh where we come to the
[57:07] podcast and now we have the end routine
[57:10] uh from the previous guest is asking a
[57:12] question for the next guest without
[57:13] knowing who the next guest is and the
[57:15] last guest asks you what are your
[57:17] current thoughts on the the first half
[57:20] year of of the Bitcoin
[57:23] ETF um I think it's uh it opens the
[57:27] flood gates of Wall Street and brings in
[57:31] new money into Bitcoin which is great
[57:35] and yeah I don't um you know the
[57:38] grayscale fund sold a lot of Bitcoin
[57:41] when while the Black Rock uh fund bought
[57:44] a lot of Bitcoin and it kind of you know
[57:47] balanced itself out so in in in reality
[57:50] I think only like 100,000 or 200,000
[57:53] Bitcoin actually uh got bought
[57:56] in some although Black Rock and the
[57:59] other ETFs bought like 800,000 you know
[58:03] because grayscale sold so many so that's
[58:06] could also explain why the price isn't
[58:09] moving that much but it's accumulation
[58:11] phase right now and it's just a matter
[58:13] of time and we are only seeing the
[58:15] beginning most people don't understand
[58:17] that um Bitcoin is actually way too
[58:20] small for the big guys to put money in
[58:22] it you know they have to wait until
[58:24] Bitcoin has a market value value like
[58:26] all of like 15 trillion and then only
[58:29] then they can start to put money into it
[58:32] which is kind of crazy yeah but uh it's
[58:34] it's going to be a lot of fun during the
[58:37] next uh maybe one or two years at least
[58:40] and then we'll
[58:41] see I think also the real flood gates
[58:44] they they really like they are start
[58:47] slowly starting to open and the the
[58:49] water is now slowly coming like this is
[58:51] just the just the beginning that we are
[58:53] seeing and the ETF is in a fun topic
[58:56] because some really don't like and oh no
[58:57] it's institutional money and then I'm
[58:59] like yes but of course institutional
[59:01] money is coming in when it's the best
[59:03] for a saving place for financial energy
[59:06] uh perfect that then thank you Dominic
