[00:00] we will see in the 10 or 20 years one
[00:02] Bitcoin being worth $10 million you
[00:05] learn that 2% inflation is good well
[00:07] that's just there should not be
[00:09] inflation deflation is actually great
[00:12] 50% of the world problems are basically
[00:14] caused by a few holding on to the money
[00:17] uh printer it shouldn't be that hard
[00:19] it's made that hard because central
[00:22] banks were set up and they took over the
[00:25] biggest Monopoly in the world called
[00:27] money creation people can now hardly
[00:29] afford buying a house it's terrible but
[00:31] it's man-made it's created by this
[00:33] system this unfair system Bitcoin brings
[00:36] the system back to even K and fair you
[00:39] end up in a citadel or you end up in a
[00:41] Renaissance where uh things are good
[00:44] fair and equal the hardest money always
[00:47] wins people and money will always go to
[00:50] where they're treated best in the ECB
[00:53] they are scared shitless and if you are
[00:55] scared shitless and your biggest profit
[00:57] making scheme ever invented is now now
[01:00] under Jess what do you do you you kick
[01:02] and you scream and that's what we see
[01:05] legard do have found the hardest money
[01:07] ever and you put some money into it it
[01:09] will go up forever it's mathematically
[01:12] programmed to go up forever and it will
[01:14] it brings back the power to the person
[01:16] it's not just abundance in wealth or in
[01:18] money but abundance in ideas abundance
[01:20] in time abundance in Sharing love
[01:22] creating uh
[01:24] [Music]
[01:28] stuff before we get into Bitcoin uh
[01:31] really briefly what are you doing I
[01:33] think you had uh you founded co-founded
[01:35] Amsterdam Capital Manager Management I
[01:38] remember that
[01:39] correctly yes that's right so basically
[01:43] there's two two things basically I
[01:46] Bitcoin OG which I first came across in
[01:50] 2013 so long time I'm still waiting for
[01:54] my mount g uh money to come back if ever
[01:59] yeah and ups and downs of course you
[02:01] know we've had three times going down in
[02:04] the cycle 70 80% so you really have to
[02:07] uh you know it's the School of Hard
[02:10] noock um and so that's my um one passion
[02:14] or or or activity and the other one is
[02:17] is Amsterdam Capital Management which is
[02:19] equity
[02:20] research uh so we do research of share
[02:23] markets different share markets for
[02:25] clients and uh they buy it mainly in a
[02:29] subscription form form so that can be
[02:31] family offices wealth funds High net
[02:33] worth individuals and we have our own
[02:36] Quant model to uh look for those
[02:39] companies that are improving and so
[02:41] basically yeah we buy those and stay
[02:43] away from the companies that are
[02:45] deteriorating and that's worked really
[02:47] well so I've been doing that with a few
[02:49] Partners now for 10 years yeah for
[02:52] instance the longest running product is
[02:54] is a Dutch one uh so the Dutch stock
[02:56] market and there we've been compounding
[02:57] at 18.3%
[03:00] per year which is very high and let's
[03:02] say 5 to 10% higher than than the stock
[03:05] market so and that also brings me back
[03:08] to let's say my sort of overall
[03:10] background which is financial so I've
[03:12] always been in the financial world I
[03:14] used to be in corporate finance uh
[03:16] merges and Acquisitions buying and
[03:18] selling companies both here in Amsterdam
[03:22] but also I went to do that for 14 years
[03:24] in New Zealand so um uh yeah have seen
[03:29] lots of different things in lots of
[03:30] different
[03:31] companies and when you sell a company
[03:34] you sort of get to see the inside and
[03:35] what makes it tick and how different
[03:37] business models work and how different
[03:39] companies uh you know make their uh make
[03:42] their money uh so that's helped me with
[03:45] the with the equity uh research
[03:48] interesting uh uh just briefly what is
[03:51] Quant I never heard that Quant comes
[03:54] from quantitative and it basically means
[03:57] using a lot of data
[04:01] and you also the opposite would be
[04:02] qualitative so you know to make it
[04:04] really simple if you keep it in the sort
[04:07] of equity in the share market stuff like
[04:09] a Quant basically uses financial data
[04:12] which is normally sort of historical
[04:15] data and if it's qualitative it means
[04:18] you go and for instance talk to the CEO
[04:21] or go and visit the company and come up
[04:23] with you know your own feeling of
[04:26] whether you know the CEO is going to
[04:27] build out the company or or other
[04:30] stuff but we are pure Quant so we
[04:33] basically use uh all the sort of
[04:36] information that is in the financial
[04:39] statement so if you every company uh and
[04:42] I don't know if you want to talk about
[04:43] mm Capital Management because I can talk
[04:45] about it a
[04:47] lot so you stop me if if it's too much
[04:50] about that but um so we use financial
[04:54] statements as our raw ingredients and
[04:57] they become liquid nowadays so so you
[05:00] can just uh you know uh use AI or other
[05:03] stuff to go through financial statements
[05:05] like annual report or quarterly reports
[05:08] and so you can look for all sorts of
[05:10] stuff in there you know correlations
[05:12] signals as we call it and so um that's
[05:16] what we do and with a technical world
[05:19] word it's called bottomup fundamental
[05:23] analysis which basically means we really
[05:26] look at the company its financials and
[05:28] pull that out of each other and really
[05:30] look for stuff like in the in the cash
[05:33] flow in the balance sheet in the profit
[05:35] and loss and we have got like 90 signals
[05:40] that tell us whether a company is
[05:43] improving and so if you have quite a few
[05:45] companies that improve then slowly but
[05:49] surely uh you outperform uh the index
[05:52] and uh so although our information is
[05:56] based on the past it sort of throws a
[06:00] shadow into the future because a company
[06:04] that is improving can't stop improving
[06:06] overnight so it normally goes on for two
[06:09] to three qus so 6 to n months so if
[06:12] you've got a lot of improving companies
[06:14] then uh yeah slowly but surely you uh
[06:18] you outperform the index and not every
[06:20] year but on average over an economic
[06:24] cycle which is between four to six years
[06:26] so uh yeah so back to your question so
[06:29] yeah Bitcoin on the one side uh our big
[06:32] passion and then the luxury of having a
[06:36] algorithm or Quant model that actually
[06:39] works because uh people in the stock
[06:41] market will tell you it's very very hard
[06:44] to you know make a good performance 95%
[06:47] of the investors including everybody on
[06:49] Wall Street cannot outperform a stock
[06:52] index so it's it's usually a uh a very
[06:56] tough environment so yeah blessed and
[06:59] and lucky and happy that we we have got
[07:01] a system that uh that does that and also
[07:05] what comes with a system because people
[07:07] mainly lose money in the stock market
[07:09] because of
[07:10] psychological uh traps like you know you
[07:14] uh buy when things look you know going
[07:16] up then people go oh then I need some of
[07:18] that I'll buy some of it but that's the
[07:19] moment you shouldn't be buying uh and
[07:22] then if the the whole thing crashes then
[07:24] you would typically want to sell because
[07:25] you don't want to be associated with
[07:27] something that's crashing and that again
[07:28] is another py psychological trap so if
[07:31] you have a system then you don't fall
[07:34] into all those traps so that's the sort
[07:35] of second thing that also really helps
[07:38] uh us and our clients because the system
[07:40] just says the companies now no longer
[07:42] outperform as it's called a good company
[07:45] it's now a neutral or a underperform and
[07:49] we just sell it without looking at any
[07:51] psychological uh stuff so that helps and
[07:55] that helps our clients as well because
[07:57] they can sleep at night uh you know
[07:59] knowing that the system is taken care of
[08:01] it really really cool um which brings me
[08:05] kind of to my next question um it sounds
[08:07] like you come really from the
[08:08] traditional Financial space how did you
[08:10] get Bitcoin so early and usually it's
[08:12] like Cipher buks and and and and those
[08:14] things like how did you get Bitcoin in
[08:16] in 2013 with your background yeah well
[08:19] that's where that's where I like to give
[08:20] myself a compliment but I mean you
[08:22] should always be careful when you start
[08:23] complimenting yourself but it was so I
[08:26] wasn't sort of mining I wasn't a techie
[08:28] that was mining and just as a side uh
[08:30] offshoot you know I started accumulating
[08:32] bitcom no I really did discover it so uh
[08:36] I read the Wired Magazine and actually
[08:39] our biggest hero Max Kaiser I came
[08:41] across him I think in
[08:43] 2011 and it was one of those things
[08:46] where you read about it and then you
[08:47] sort of looked stuff up but in 2011 it
[08:50] was very very difficult to you know you
[08:52] know set up a wallet or whatever so that
[08:56] was so then that stopped but then back
[08:59] in 20 2013 I read this wed magazine
[09:03] article and I've always been someone
[09:05] that likes to solve puzzles you know um
[09:09] left brain right brain what is it you
[09:11] know looking for the old things and uh
[09:14] always want to solve equations and this
[09:17] was like the perfect equation perfect uh
[09:20] you know absolute scarcity being uh
[09:24] discovered in the universe ever and so
[09:28] it it grew from there and obviously you
[09:30] know you need to do what is it 500 hours
[09:33] before you really get it so I mean I
[09:35] didn't obviously get it straight away
[09:38] but it it did really connect and click
[09:40] and it was both that absolute scarcity
[09:43] was invented which is you know as big as
[09:45] the number zero or is bigger than than
[09:47] uh anything we've seen in the universe
[09:50] and that together for also for the first
[09:52] time that state and money could be
[09:56] separated and obviously being a student
[09:58] of economics I studied economics I've
[10:01] always been disappointed with everything
[10:03] we've had to learn I remember me sitting
[10:05] in University having to learn all sorts
[10:08] of stuff including the efficient market
[10:10] hypothesis and whatever a supply and
[10:14] demand curve which are like two static
[10:17] lines trying to explain a dynamic
[10:20] environment so a lot of resistance was
[10:23] built up in May and I knew a lot of
[10:25] things were not right just like
[10:28] inflation which you know you learn that
[10:30] 2% inflation is good well that's just
[10:32]  you know there should not be
[10:35] inflation uh and deflation is actually
[10:38] great the price of Tomorrow Jeff books
[10:40] Jeff Boo's book is brilliant brilliant
[10:43] in in explaining that but that will
[10:46] never be explained to you in uh you know
[10:48] University about economics so uh Bitcoin
[10:53] also helped me to uh resolve all those
[10:55] things that I knew were not sitting well
[10:58] and um yeah so it sort of came from
[11:00] there and uh then you go down the rabbit
[11:04] hole and the rabbit hole goes deeper and
[11:07] deeper and still you know uh is going uh
[11:10] going on so it was wonderful it's like
[11:13] uh you come for the money stay for the
[11:15] revolution uh you come for solving
[11:18] puzzles but you stay because you can
[11:21] become a sovereign individual or a uh
[11:24] you know problems maybe 50% of the world
[11:27] problems are basically called cused by a
[11:30] few holding on to the money printer if
[11:34] that can be taken out of their hands uh
[11:37] and we can go back to uh the the
[11:40] Byzantium Empire for instance of a few
[11:43] hundred years where the gold was the
[11:45] standard something that could not be
[11:47] manipulated only by maybe 2% if you dig
[11:50] dig deeper and faster but uh so now yeah
[11:54] this was also leading to you know uh
[11:57] perfect uh economy and uh let's say if
[12:01] you talk about economics like canes
[12:06] and all the other schools basically the
[12:09] one that that that comes closest to all
[12:12] of this is of course the Austrian School
[12:14] where uh uh so it's sort of glove in
[12:17] hand and it's it became more and more
[12:20] interesting and then you meet different
[12:22] people and then Market starts
[12:24] developing uh then you see different
[12:27] products uh developing then you see the
[12:29] base layer and the lightning layer being
[12:32] built on top of it so basically yeah if
[12:34] you look at money it's sort of got the
[12:36] three properties right U unit of account
[12:39] medium of exchange and the store of
[12:41] value the store of value by far is the
[12:44] most important one and the stor of value
[12:48] sort of comes first and the other is
[12:51] medium of exchange or Unity of account
[12:53] can come after that but don't have to uh
[12:57] and so if all we would do with Bitcoin
[12:59] is create the perfect medium uh sorry
[13:02] store of value then already I mean you
[13:06] can think of um uh living in uh in well
[13:10] not Paradise but places where War can no
[13:13] longer be financed where people can
[13:15] basically save their toil their their
[13:19] hard earned stuff uh over time and over
[13:23] space and everything that money was
[13:26] supposed to solve which is nothing more
[13:28] than sort of oil or a
[13:30] lubricant um is then taken out of the
[13:33] hands of those that want to manipulate
[13:35] and control it and it can just be what
[13:37] it needs to be uh being a lubricant to
[13:41] uh allow uh interaction and trade and uh
[13:45] people to uh to grow um and and and also
[13:49] save their hard work toil which if you
[13:52] look at the economy today you cannot
[13:55] save and this gives unrest I mean uh a
[13:58] piece of cheese in in in Holland used to
[14:01] be6 then it was 8 now it's € 12 now I
[14:03] think it's 14 people cannot afford it so
[14:06] all those problems are being solved as
[14:09] well by this huge
[14:10] invention absolutely it's it's it's
[14:13] massive uh you also already mentioned uh
[14:16] some of the implications uh of having
[14:19] now with Bitcoin absolute scarcity what
[14:21] is for you the the biggest
[14:23] implication uh on on a global scale when
[14:28] more people just like a small group that
[14:31] we are now that have Bitcoin or actually
[14:34] understand Bitcoin but when like a
[14:36] majority of the world actually gets
[14:38] Bitcoin and has Bitcoin what do you
[14:40] think is one of the the the biggest
[14:41] implications of having the Bitcoin
[14:44] having some money having absolute
[14:46] scarcity well basically you can take
[14:49] away nearly all of the problems that
[14:51] come comes with Rogue money and replace
[14:55] it with something that is um near
[14:58] perfect but I mean it all it does it it
[15:01] functions as you know allowing uh your
[15:05] hard work to be put into something
[15:08] temporarily called you know saving or
[15:11] that you can transact with someone else
[15:15] so that uh basically it shouldn't be
[15:17] that hard it's made that hard because
[15:20] you know central banks were set up and
[15:23] they
[15:24] basically took over the biggest Monopoly
[15:28] in the world called money creation but
[15:30] now it would go back to the people so
[15:33] huge amount of positive implications all
[15:36] the unbanked can become banked all the
[15:39] people that are now being stolen from by
[15:42] inflation will no longer be stolen from
[15:46] but will also start living uh a
[15:48] different life if money is hard which
[15:51] this is the hardest money ever invented
[15:54] it means that investments will get uh
[15:58] back to the definition that what it
[16:01] should always be you know if you want to
[16:04] invest something you need to know for
[16:06] the next few Generations that the money
[16:08] is hard and it will not melt away or
[16:10] like a like an ice cube uh you know uh
[16:14] and also things like we now have to work
[16:17] so much harder I think it was only 60
[16:20] years ago that uh let's say the man of
[16:23] the family had to work I think a few
[16:25] days in the week he could then afford a
[16:29] house he could afford a family with two
[16:31] children and they would all live uh
[16:34] comfortably now uh the man has to work
[16:37] the woman has to work the kids some
[16:39] sometimes also have to work and all you
[16:41] get in return is is empty calories and
[16:43] and you can't even you know make do
[16:46] people can hardly afford buying a house
[16:49] let's say the younger generation are
[16:50] basically locked out of ever buying a
[16:52] house it's terrible but it's it's it's
[16:55] man-made it's created by this system
[16:57] this unfair system and Bitcoin brings
[17:01] the system back to even q and fair and
[17:05] it's never been this way let's say haak
[17:08] and forus that's that's what they were
[17:10] Dreaming Of Human Action uh you know the
[17:13] incentive comes from the person and a
[17:17] person if a person works hard he can
[17:20] then accum accumulate toil or
[17:23] savings and that's the the the incentive
[17:26] that needs to be in every economy but
[17:29] you don't want it with with with Rogue
[17:31] instruments so the Rogue instruments
[17:33] have been
[17:34] removed uh efficiency can take place you
[17:38] can come close to you know complete zero
[17:41] inefficiency because you know it costs
[17:44] nothing to over space and time to uh put
[17:48] your Bitcoin or your Satoshi over the
[17:51] lightning Network everyone can um be
[17:55] part of it you know you cannot be
[17:57] excluded like what we live in now you
[18:00] know now it's a club and we're not in it
[18:02] you know there's only a few that are in
[18:04] it now everybody can choose to be in it
[18:07] but you're not forced to and it puts
[18:09] everybody on an even queue and if you
[18:11] know that you can now save for your
[18:14] children uh and your grandchildren uh
[18:18] the world will change uh and you will
[18:20] your life will change and so yeah that's
[18:23] the revolution that that that's amazing
[18:27] it's it's kind of like we're entering a
[18:29] new Financial EPO like something
[18:31] completely different than we were in the
[18:34] last hundreds of years uh it's like we
[18:36] right at the start of of a new Epoch a
[18:40] new uh time frame even like there's do
[18:44] you also subscribe to the time chain
[18:47] time chain aspect that maybe is Bitcoin
[18:49] even like Beyond just being money
[18:52] actually like Bitcoin having an imp
[18:54] implication of how we account for time
[18:57] and events in in history yes like High
[19:00] Time preference and low time preference
[19:02] uh and that is key so at the moment we
[19:05] are just uh rats running around in our
[19:09] little red cage and having to you know
[19:12] keep running faster because inflation is
[19:14] stealing it away from
[19:16] us uh but if you go back to the
[19:18] Renaissance uh then you know time was
[19:22] not so important and the most beautiful
[19:25] things could be created and that is what
[19:27] will come back it's already coming back
[19:30] I mean basically uh I live on the
[19:32] Bitcoin standard and you know you your
[19:34] time preference changes and you start
[19:37] thinking in uh 10 20 100 200 300 years
[19:41] as it as it should be because nothing
[19:45] works well if you're just in a
[19:47] materialistic world where you are uh
[19:51] living from hand to mouth or from day to
[19:54] day uh and that will all stop so you
[19:58] know you can trust the money you know it
[20:02] will always be there uh you know nobody
[20:06] can ever take it off you you know it can
[20:08] never be corrupted it can never be uh
[20:11] conjured or or pulled together by a
[20:13] group so basically all that is has been
[20:17] resolved and all you then need to do is
[20:20] decide how hard or not so hard you want
[20:23] to work people will keep some people
[20:25] will keep working hard some people will
[20:27] work less but I mean you know that
[20:29] everything you do will be conserved into
[20:32] the future and that has never happened
[20:34] before it happened a little bit under
[20:36] the gold standard which was far superior
[20:38] to to the we're living in today but
[20:41] this is ultra this has never happened
[20:44] before um and then you come into things
[20:47] like deflation and inflation so
[20:50] basically Bitcoin is
[20:52] deflationary but deflation is the most
[20:55] beautiful thing that there's ever
[20:57] happened because you can explain it very
[20:58] very simple you know technological
[21:01] innovation allows us to produce more
[21:04] than than we could yesterday like the
[21:05] combine harvester or the AI or a
[21:08] computer chip so because of man's um uh
[21:13] knowledge and improving knowledge the
[21:17] pancake if you would or the cake grows
[21:19] every year by around 2% and now because
[21:23] technological innovation might be even
[21:24] speeding up with a AI it could be 3% so
[21:28] everyone should actually pay two to 3%
[21:32] less for their cheese or for their
[21:34] iPhone or for whatever else all day
[21:37] every day but that's not happening
[21:40] because inflation is stealing it away
[21:41] they're printing printing money up which
[21:43] then surpasses the deflation and then
[21:46] goes into inflation but if there was no
[21:50] money printer and there is just a 21
[21:52] million Bitcoins um then that would be
[21:56] you know uh there would be a slow
[21:58] deflation which basically means
[22:01] everybody gets Rich richer partially by
[22:03] their own toil but partially just
[22:06] because the the humankind has
[22:09] technological innovation which is used
[22:11] for everyone I mean the combine
[22:12] harvester replaced 500 labor workers or
[22:15] field workers so you end up in a in a in
[22:20] in a citadel or you end up in a
[22:22] Renaissance where uh things are good
[22:25] fair and and equal so uh yeah I can't
[22:30] wait it's it's fascinating when we think
[22:32] about the implications of that because
[22:35] it's so different it it it it's such a
[22:38] huge thing um when we think about that
[22:43] Bitcoin standard that Bitcoin renissance
[22:44] the Bitcoin world that that we we are
[22:47] entering now what do you think is kind
[22:48] of an unexpected outcome uh that that
[22:51] you think of that that people or
[22:54] bitcoiners maybe not have on the radar
[22:56] what do you think will be something unex
[22:58] Ed there well the fight is on obviously
[23:02] you know first they laugh at you then
[23:04] they uh ridicule you uh then they fight
[23:07] you and then we win now they're fighting
[23:10] us there was just an article I think
[23:12] last two days in the ECB ECB Bank
[23:15] European Central Bank saying that how
[23:17] unfair it is for people that came early
[23:20] to bitcoin and it should not you know
[23:22] that they're getting a free ride or
[23:23] something it's a bit like saying
[23:25] somebody that discovered Fang go or
[23:26] rembrand early
[23:29] is a criminal so so they're on their
[23:31] last sort of arguments now trying to you
[23:34] know create a situation where the the
[23:36] people will try and uh go against
[23:39] Bitcoin but so yeah so I mean there'll
[23:41] be huge fights uh still going on but
[23:43] we're now at the last stage so uh of uh
[23:47] countries adopting of central banks
[23:50] adopting two president presidential
[23:53] candidates in America have now said they
[23:55] want it so so yeah I mean what will be
[23:58] surprising is I guess the amount of
[24:00] fights that still have to take place but
[24:03] on the other hand I think it will go
[24:05] very quickly and one of the least uh
[24:10] mentioned things I think in that is
[24:12] let's say Game Theory all this is about
[24:14] Game Theory and Game Theory just says
[24:18] that if if you know uh let's say a
[24:21] country Holland treats people with
[24:24] Bitcoin badly and taxes them and makes
[24:26] their life hard and uh then people vote
[24:29] with their feet and go to El Salvador or
[24:32] go somewhere else so the powers that be
[24:35] will obviously do everything to try and
[24:38] block it and stop it and that's what
[24:39] they're calling it uh you know uh red
[24:42] poison Square on and on it goes but
[24:45] there's no use they can try but there's
[24:47] no use because you know it's just like a
[24:50] water mattress if you push on one side
[24:52] uh it goes up on the other side that's
[24:54] what people do people can vote with
[24:56] their feet and now they can vote with
[24:58] their with their money with their uh
[25:01] energy and there's no stopping it so
[25:04] there's not even if all the governments
[25:06] in the world would sort of hold hands
[25:07] and try and you know control it um even
[25:11] then that would not work I mean you
[25:13] couldn't stop the the alcohol B in
[25:15] America you cannot stop certain things
[25:17] it's a bit like weed I mean it's like
[25:20] somebody gets the assignment to kill all
[25:22] the weed in the world well you can't
[25:24] it's so that's where we are and Game
[25:27] Theory makes it uh hugely Dynamic and
[25:31] hugely interesting because it could be
[25:33] Qatar it could be kuwa it could be uh
[25:37] Russia mining but also adopting and also
[25:41] putting it on on their Central Bank
[25:44] Ledger and you know as soon as Kuwait
[25:47] would for instance say well we have now
[25:50] adopted Bitcoin as our Central Reserve
[25:53] then it automatically you know means
[25:56] that every man in his dog every other
[25:58] country needs to also think about it
[26:00] because only the first five cabs of the
[26:04] rank can get ahead and the rest will
[26:07] have to you know spend their life trying
[26:09] to catch up where you cannot catch up
[26:11] just like another company cannot really
[26:14] now catch up with the micro strategy you
[26:16] know 200,000 250,000 Bitcoins too hard
[26:19] to accumulate so that's game theory and
[26:23] this game theory is is so Dynamic and so
[26:26] powerful on a country level on a central
[26:28] bank level on a company level on an
[26:30] individual level and we're sort of now
[26:33] getting into yeah the big stages you
[26:36] know where the Big Blocks are falling so
[26:37] yeah I think it will fall faster than we
[26:41] uh we think and let's say there's sort
[26:44] of like three Apostles that sort of
[26:47] steer Bitcoin keep it on track and one
[26:51] is Game
[26:52] Theory and one is let's say Network
[26:55] effect and network effect is why you
[26:58] know a company like apple or Amazon is
[27:01] so hard to outroot because you know once
[27:04] everyone uses it everyone uses it but
[27:07] there is no product more powerful ever
[27:10] in the world than having One World
[27:12] Currency if you just have one currency
[27:15] and there is no friction and everyone
[27:18] can use it and nobody can be excluded uh
[27:21] then you have got the most powerful
[27:23] Network effect and so that's now coming
[27:26] together and then the other third sort
[27:29] of apostle I would call Path dependency
[27:32] you know it's a Divine uh it came at the
[27:35] right
[27:36] time uh and it came small and uh
[27:42] understated just like in H or F books
[27:46] you know a Sly and roundabout way to
[27:49] disrupt the current central bank system
[27:53] um and so yeah there cannot be a Bitcoin
[27:55] 2.0il or another coin whatever doesn't
[27:58] matter it will just be this but it's a
[28:01] force for the good it's a force for for
[28:03] for Humanity I partnered up with coin
[28:07] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[28:10] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[28:13] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[28:16] love it so much coin vigilante made a
[28:19] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[28:21] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[28:24] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[28:27] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[28:31] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[28:33] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[28:36] watch collections you have the date of
[28:39] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[28:42] there and of course also the block
[28:44] height and which EPO we are currently in
[28:48] I love the level of detail they put in
[28:51] in this master piece and make sure to
[28:53] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[28:56] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[28:59] love those watches so so much if you
[29:02] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:04] regular basis I'll guess you already
[29:06] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[29:09] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[29:12] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[29:15] personal recommendation for Hardware
[29:16] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[29:19] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[29:21] gift for friend who has still the
[29:23] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[29:26] 5% disc account with the code Robin at
[29:29] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[29:33] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[29:36] step is to really level up your
[29:38] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[29:41] have the most secure self- custody setup
[29:44] you have to secure your own devices you
[29:47] have to protect your privacy you have to
[29:49] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[29:52] on where you live you even want to have
[29:54] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[29:57] move in case something goes really
[29:59] really wrong and through all those steps
[30:01] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[30:04] step by step and if you visit the
[30:06] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[30:10] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[30:13] out how you can level up your
[30:16] sovereignty that's super interesting
[30:18] also love the breakdown with the those
[30:20] free uh stools with the three pillows uh
[30:23] really really cool um the first one is
[30:27] right now I feel like the most uh
[30:29] exciting one the game theory aspect we
[30:32] have on the one side America where both
[30:35] parties kind of agree on bitcoin Trump
[30:38] Administration I guess a little bit more
[30:40] than than Harris but Harris also uh got
[30:43] got more friendly because of
[30:46] trump uh around Bitcoin uh then we have
[30:51] the EU and the ECP saying like oh it's
[30:53] unfair and stuff like that uh but at the
[30:56] same time there's ma coming up there's a
[30:58] lot of regulations coming out with with
[31:00] Bitcoin uh so they are recognizing it
[31:03] definitely uh but I still get actually
[31:06] like just two or three days ago yeah two
[31:08] days ago I had a meeting with uh far far
[31:14] family uh to all the people um to wanted
[31:18] to get into Bitcoin and they're like hey
[31:21] is is it even safe will it be Bann and
[31:23] stuff like that so so it's still in
[31:25] people's mind uh it's still something
[31:28] that people think about it I like I have
[31:30] every day a Bitcoin podcast I'm in such
[31:32] a bullish Echo chamber that like this
[31:36] thought is not even in my mind no think
[31:39] about it what sorry I said no escaping
[31:41] for for you you're being in inated every
[31:46] day yes most knowledgeable Bitcoin
[31:49] person around I would say yes 10,000
[31:53] hours probably people have been bashing
[31:55] your head about how perfect Bitcoin is
[31:58] that's true it's like now almost 300
[32:01] episodes uh I think that someone in
[32:03] Amsterdam actually said it to me that uh
[32:06] when when I actually do it for 10 years
[32:08] and my plan is to do it now what I do
[32:10] did for now 11 months actually like in
[32:13] three days it will be exactly 11 months
[32:14] that I do it uh when I do that for 10
[32:17] years I probably been the most
[32:18] knowledgeable person in Bitcoin right
[32:20] now I'm not that at all like I'm far
[32:22] away from that there's so many more
[32:24] smart people in in in the in the Bitcoin
[32:28] but for me the the thing that I wanted
[32:30] to get back to is the game theory aspect
[32:32] what do you think currently is the the
[32:34] status of of game with the ECP being uh
[32:38] more aggressive against it but then
[32:40] America uh being really friendly to it
[32:43] and trying to get it but then there's
[32:44] also like the small states like bhan and
[32:46] Salvador that are extremely Pro
[32:49] Bitcoin well they're scared now let's
[32:52] say my best estimate is maybe like three
[32:55] years ago Wall Street
[32:58] finally got it and it's logical because
[33:00] if you've got a good thing going if you
[33:02] control the central bank and if you
[33:03] control the money supply why would you
[33:05] go and disrupt why would you go and look
[33:07] at a little small little disruptive
[33:08] thing you know why would you uh so they
[33:11] didn't care they didn't do the homework
[33:14] if you don't put the 50 hours into
[33:16] Bitcoin you're not going to get it it's
[33:17] you know it's it's you need to put it in
[33:20] so only three years ago Larry think and
[33:24] Jamie Diamond who still calls it a pet
[33:26] rock or whatever although he's not
[33:27] positive I mean with all these people
[33:29] you see the
[33:31] 180° 180° shift first seven years or
[33:34] whatever they poooo it and only Warren
[33:37] Buffett is still po pooing it but I mean
[33:38] yeah I guess his time is is been but
[33:41] then and that's the game theory in
[33:44] play they they make the 180 degrees and
[33:49] it's it's not that they're trying to be
[33:51] the smartest boy in the class it's it's
[33:53] the forces that of game theory that
[33:55] forces it so the clients of uh Black
[33:58] Rock are asking Larry think what's your
[34:01] Bitcoin strategy I want to have some
[34:03] Bitcoin why where why can't I so I mean
[34:06] it comes from from everywhere those
[34:08] forces and then um yeah and then he
[34:12] starts doing the work or he one of his
[34:14] smart smartest analyst uh gets sent out
[34:16] and has to find out is Bitcoin for real
[34:21] how can we break it can we ever control
[34:24] it can we ever take it over what's
[34:26] what's this and then they come to the
[34:29] answers that they can't control it maybe
[34:31] a little bit in The Fringe uh but it is
[34:34] for Real it's a divine intervention
[34:37] basically it's perfect scarcity it's the
[34:41] perfect asset class ever uh
[34:44] conceived and the the coin starts
[34:47] dropping and and they do the 180 and now
[34:50] uh he's singing all the Praises uh of
[34:53] Bitcoin and and he has to H because it's
[34:56] survival and uh then everybody else
[34:59] joins 11 ETFs join and everybody jumping
[35:02] over each other and so so that's what we
[35:05] we see and that's just in three years
[35:07] time I think truly that you know because
[35:10] we have a couple of funds we have you
[35:12] know I've I've got someone my partner
[35:14] who comes out of the the London and and
[35:15] the Wall Street Scene who normally
[35:18] manages let's say7 billion do but so
[35:21] I've seen it up close how people there
[35:24] privately had some Bitcoin but the
[35:26] official story was you did not uh have
[35:29] Bitcoin and then some of them started
[35:31] doing deep Dives and started seeing it
[35:34] and you always had the roges you know
[35:36] people that starting up funds in
[35:37] Bitcoins but the the great majority did
[35:40] not see it or want to see it or have to
[35:42] see it because they're paycheck was not
[35:44] dependent on it but now you know Larry
[35:46] think says it everybody pays uh notices
[35:49] it and uh and then Game Theory makes
[35:52] everybody do the 180 so that's just 180
[35:55] Financial Big Wigs but it happened s
[35:57] with everything and so it's also
[35:59] happening with the the
[36:00] ECB uh so I've had a few meetings with
[36:04] uh some some big wigs from let's say the
[36:06] the Dutch ECB or previous from previous
[36:09] times you know they are now with pension
[36:11] so they can now they can now speak their
[36:15] mind and they are going through the same
[36:18] journey and they are also now seeing uh
[36:22] that yeah you can't stop it it's
[36:24] immutable it's uh unconfiscatable it's
[36:27] uh so and then they have got even more
[36:31] baggage to unpack and get rid of I just
[36:35] had what was it six years of University
[36:38] economics so six years of of getting fed
[36:40] the wrong information but if you're a
[36:42] professor of Economics or you're at this
[36:44] in Central Bank you've had 40 years or
[36:46] whatever of CES and monetarist and all
[36:50] this sort of stuff which basically
[36:51] facilitates government you know it
[36:53] doesn't facilitate the people so you
[36:56] need to all unravel that and unpack it
[36:59] and and and and go back to First
[37:01] principles and uh you know um
[37:05] initiative drives Human Action and so
[37:09] what's this all about and then and and
[37:11] so they are on their Journey now of
[37:14] finding out and so the Smart Ones Will
[37:17] and so uh buuk is smart was smart
[37:20] there'll be Central Bankers that are
[37:22] smart I think there is a few that that
[37:24] that we might know and uh then if one
[37:29] you know at some stage they'll do it
[37:30] secretly first but next will be that
[37:32] they officially put it on their on The
[37:34] Ledger as as as a reserve and it will be
[37:37] Game Theory all over again and we'll see
[37:39] green green candles uh and uh on it goes
[37:43] the the the Omega candle the Omega
[37:46] candle and what's also because we're
[37:48] talking about the sort of three Apostles
[37:50] but let's say the two other because I
[37:51] once read read a wrote a condensed
[37:55] Bitcoin business plan and it was just
[37:56] these sort of five sentences so the two
[38:00] biggest drivers are basically people and
[38:03] money go to where they're treated best
[38:07] right that's voting with your
[38:09] feet uh so that is the Bitcoin
[38:11] citadels and the other rule or driver is
[38:17] hardest money always wins you know we
[38:20] saw it with rocks and Pebbles and uh
[38:23] copper and bronze and uh gold and silver
[38:27] and you know the Lost age of China 100
[38:30] years they were on the silver standard
[38:32] they're now talking over the Lost
[38:34] Century because the West had gold harder
[38:38] money so the hardest money always wins
[38:42] people and money will always go to where
[38:44] they're treated best those are two
[38:47] Dynamic forces that that power this
[38:50] ahead and then those three Apostles like
[38:53] Network effect Game Theory and divine
[38:56] intervention just like a rocket keep it
[38:59] on track and uh so we all we only need
[39:03] to wait uh it can take long or it can go
[39:06] fast I think it will go fast and
[39:09] uh yeah a new era will be born
[39:13] absolutely do do you think that the ECP
[39:17] gets that
[39:18] already or they still at the point where
[39:22] they think they can actually damage it
[39:25] they think they can can can can uh they
[39:28] can still talk it bad talk it but Game
[39:33] Theory stops that and let's say the the
[39:36] the ECB people that have left the
[39:39] ECB are now already understanding it and
[39:43] thinking about it and playing with it
[39:45] and coming are are also orange filled uh
[39:51] and um and in the ECB they are scared
[39:58] basically and if you are scared shitless
[39:59] and your um biggest profit making scheme
[40:04] ever invented ever is now under Jess
[40:08] what do you do you you kick and you
[40:09] scream and that's what we see legard do
[40:14] and uh call it bad names but I mean all
[40:17] this will be the same for everyone else
[40:19] I mean 180 degrees we saw Larry think do
[40:21] it you know Jamie Diamond did do it so
[40:25] if one or two or three well just need
[40:27] one Central Bank to adopt it call it the
[40:30] Russian central bank just to throw in
[40:32] the geopol political stuff it'll be like
[40:34] a cardiac arrest it will be a heart
[40:37] attack it will be we we need to get with
[40:40] it or or we're out I mean they do
[40:42] understand Game Theory and now you've
[40:44] got game theory which is maybe the most
[40:46] powerful uh instrument in town together
[40:50] with the most Divine most scarce uh ever
[40:54] invented in the Galaxy uh uh unit called
[40:58] called Bitcoin so these two are uh
[41:01] hugely powerful and and and and they and
[41:03] they will uh they will react so um yeah
[41:07] uh I I'm afraid ECB will react last
[41:10] there will always be countries that
[41:12] won't and will you know uh incentive
[41:15] drives Human Action I mean I guess the
[41:18] legarda is not really you know her
[41:20] salary is not really uh going to go down
[41:23] if she doesn't adopt but El Salvador or
[41:26] Paraguay or arent Ina or small countries
[41:28] with people having huge remittance
[41:30] issues you know it they will they will
[41:32] go first and uh yeah that's all you need
[41:35] because then you have Game Theory it's
[41:36] it's it's happening what do you think
[41:39] will will happen uh to the global um
[41:42] Power metric once uh there are the
[41:45] countries that actually get it and they
[41:47] adopt it early and then there are those
[41:49] countries or even like European Union uh
[41:52] a lot of countries are in there where
[41:54] they don't uh adopt it because the USA
[41:57] is or the ECP say like oh we we don't
[41:59] want to touch that and they actually
[42:01] last of the of the bunch and maybe
[42:03] America adopts it first maybe even like
[42:05] the Pricks maybe adopted first let's see
[42:08] uh like what what happens on a on a
[42:10] global scale on nation states is is that
[42:13] uh kind of the the shift of the power
[42:16] that that we are kind of seeing in in
[42:17] real time absolutely like we were
[42:20] talking about the Lost Century of China
[42:23] 100 years on the silver standard and
[42:25] West was 100 years on the gold standard
[42:26] but that's the biggest reasons why the
[42:28] West Was the West and West was so
[42:30] powerful and could dominate the world
[42:32] and the same will happen here you know
[42:35] those that don't um adapt uh adopt the
[42:39] Bitcoin uh will stay behind so it's a
[42:42] bit like a swamp Bitcoin you pay the
[42:44] price you deserve so if the ECB or
[42:47] Europe says well you know we'll do
[42:49] without Bitcoin thank you very much we
[42:50] will do our own uh Central Bank digital
[42:54] currency or whatever uh people will have
[42:57] voted with their feet they've gone to El
[42:59] Salvador other countries uh the hardest
[43:02] money in the world has left the station
[43:05] you know Europe without any Bitcoins
[43:07] Bitcoins residing in El Salvador in
[43:09] America or whatever else the country has
[43:11] adopted it and that's the hardest money
[43:13] so you get the smartest people the
[43:15] hardest money um and it solves itself
[43:18] you don't it's it's the peaceful
[43:19] Revolution and if you now look at El
[43:21] Salvador GDP up they're going to pay off
[43:24] the IMF and the World Bank 2013
[43:27] uh huge positive net migration huge
[43:30] positive net migration of the smartest
[43:32] people in the world so it's like you
[43:35] know it's the Playbook of Renaissance
[43:38] and there's only a few you know that can
[43:40] be first and the first ones get the
[43:43] spoils most of the spoils the rest will
[43:46] also get stuff but the ones behind
[43:49] unfortunately will be Europe I guess
[43:51] yeah they you know you get the you pay
[43:53] the price that you deserve and uh if in
[43:55] 20 years Europe finally
[43:57] does 180 degree it will be impoverished
[44:02] landmass unfortunately you know the the
[44:04] wealth would have gone and that's so
[44:07] hopefully they wake up but we don't know
[44:11] that but that's that's on
[44:13] them so yeah I hope so it's actually
[44:16] fascinating for me just in Germany I see
[44:19] uh two of the I don't know biggest guys
[44:21] or girls actually left uh count for
[44:25] Salvador there Lena s with the little
[44:27] hardler uh I mean she has been moving
[44:29] around a lot even before she moved to El
[44:31] Salvador but now she's in Salvador and
[44:33] she is originally from Germany then
[44:35] there's mark from the Bitcoin hotel in
[44:37] bling and he is really uh well known in
[44:40] in in Germany and there are a bunch of
[44:41] smaller ones like a bunch of uh smaller
[44:45] accounts and and people that I know of
[44:48] that just left for Salvador there like a
[44:51] group of like eight people uh that I
[44:54] know uh just just me I I don't even live
[44:57] live in
[44:58] Germany that that that left Germany for
[45:01] El Salvador and they moved there uh and
[45:04] there are so many more that move to
[45:06] other places and stuff like that so like
[45:08] the the the the brain train uh is just
[45:12] starting but it's already seen and then
[45:15] I remember in Venezuela like one third
[45:18] of the country
[45:20] left like one third that's a huge amount
[45:23] and that's probably the the upper third
[45:25] of the count that left not the the the
[45:27] lower further like uh those things have
[45:31] massive implication as you already said
[45:34] and I think I think almost nobody is
[45:36] ready to see what's happening in the
[45:38] next like few decades when when Bitcoin
[45:42] takes over I'm really looking forward to
[45:43] that that's why um I always say like
[45:46] this podcast will run out at some point
[45:47] because Bitcoin will be boring because
[45:49] it's just like everyone uses it but I
[45:52] think the time till it becomes boring
[45:54] will be extremely exciting still so so
[45:57] long you know you get the so new uh
[46:00] sovereignity you know individuals become
[46:03] sovereign you can cross borders with 12
[46:06] words in your head never before ever has
[46:09] that been possible you know if you look
[46:12] at the energy it basically solves
[46:14] climate change which I don't believe in
[46:16] anyway but I mean it uses up the
[46:19] stranded energy all the energy that goes
[46:21] to waste now so it's it's it's pure good
[46:24] uh so there'll be so many more stories I
[46:27] mean you've got the spiritual angle as
[46:30] well you know the philosoph philosophy
[46:33] about it uh it's the rabbit holes get
[46:36] bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
[46:38] so uh I think your podcast is good for
[46:40] for another five or 10 years uh you
[46:43] know I also think so I mean that's kind
[46:47] of
[46:47] my even one year before I started the
[46:50] podcast I was uh having that slog of
[46:52] like I will not shut out shut up about
[46:54] Bitcoin till it's boring till it's the
[46:57] standard uh let's see how how long it
[46:59] goes but uh if if Bitcoin is boring I'm
[47:03] I'm I'm glad I don't need the a podcast
[47:06] that's right and it's one of the sort of
[47:09] universal rules you know to have a
[47:11] successful life is basically follow your
[47:14] passion and follow it until it is no
[47:17] longer your passion you know it's your
[47:19] my passion both Bitcoin and we follow it
[47:22] and we are
[47:24] happy we enjoy it we are inquisitive
[47:27] and we're finding out more and if you
[47:29] follow your passion yeah you you will be
[47:32] uh you will also be rewarded for it
[47:34] because you add value you know you
[47:36] you're doing stuff you love and uh we
[47:39] also get rewarded for it we help other
[47:42] people create awareness uh but at the
[47:45] same time you know if you find have
[47:47] found the hardest money ever and you put
[47:49] some money into to it it will go up
[47:52] forever it's mathematically programmed
[47:54] to go up forever and it will so
[47:57] we get rewarded for it as well so yeah I
[48:01] think it goes full circle and and that
[48:03] we're doing doing we're doing good stuff
[48:06] but going to say we're going to do God's
[48:08] work that's what Jamie Diamond said so
[48:10] I'm not going to say that that's that's
[48:12] going far too far that's you you need to
[48:14] have a huge ego to say something like
[48:16] that that's true um uh what is this uh
[48:21] because you mentioned it what is the
[48:22] spiritual side of of Bitcoin a lot of
[48:25] people also like talk about Spiritual
[48:27] Awakening with
[48:29] Bitcoin yes I mean it's got so many
[48:32] dimensions I mean it's like to some
[48:36] extent a divine
[48:38] intervention if you look at the world
[48:40] now it is it is war and there is turmoil
[48:44] and the United States has done I don't
[48:47] know what it is 60 regime changes you
[48:50] know where they basically go in and
[48:51] Bully and and change a government around
[48:54] that shouldn't be the case you know it
[48:56] we should be living in a world where
[48:58] that's not the case and so that's also
[49:03] spiritual I believe and if you take the
[49:05] money printer away from these people
[49:07] they can no longer be the bullies and
[49:10] then it comes back to the Sovereign you
[49:13] as an individual as a spiritual being or
[49:16] as a as a you know an individual and you
[49:18] get to do good or you get to decide what
[49:22] you do with your toil uh people don't
[49:26] take it away from from you anymore you
[49:28] become honest you are honest because
[49:31] you're on the honest the hardest
[49:33] standard ever to to transact and that's
[49:36] what people do that's what human beings
[49:39] are you know we live together in
[49:40] villages or towns or whatever and so
[49:43] like the cancer will be removed out of
[49:46] the system and uh yeah to some extent
[49:49] that is spiritual I mean I I personally
[49:51] believe that we Are Spiritual Beings
[49:54] having a Earthly experience and this
[49:57] plays uh a role in it we're now in the
[50:00] age of Awakening the age of
[50:02] Aquarius we are now getting closer to
[50:05] ourselves again Back To Nature back to
[50:08] you know not materialistic things and
[50:11] Bitcoin is is crucial I think in that
[50:14] role you know people go from you know
[50:18] High Time preference to Low Time
[50:20] preference uh people take the time for
[50:24] good things you know it's all if you now
[50:26] look at all the that comes out of
[50:27] China you know if you throw away a
[50:29] printer you can buy a printer for 3030
[50:31] and then if it doesn't you know suit you
[50:33] you Chuck it away on the on the on the
[50:35] in the in the belt or what's it called
[50:37] the waste the belt that shouldn't be the
[50:40] case I mean you should be nice to have a
[50:43] printer that will last for 20 years or
[50:46] you know so and all those incentives
[50:48] will come back to that because you're
[50:50] not running around on your treadmill
[50:52] like like an idiot and this trying to
[50:54] you know make do because inflation is
[50:56] stealing everything everything away then
[50:58] inflation has stopped it's become
[51:00] deflationary your time Horizon you know
[51:03] it's a bit like you're going you're
[51:04] looking down now like you know pedling
[51:07] like hell and then you can look into the
[51:09] future five years 10 years one
[51:11] generation two generation three
[51:13] generations knowing that your toil your
[51:15] hard savings will always be there and
[51:17] probably more worth more than than what
[51:19] they are today and your decisions your
[51:21] investment decisions your family
[51:23] decisions they will all change for the
[51:25] better so I I think that's Divine and
[51:28] yeah that's spiritual and to some extent
[51:31] you know it it it I think the time has
[51:33] come for uh Bitcoin for the people
[51:39] absolutely I 100% agree with that um
[51:41] we're already coming closer to the one
[51:43] hour Mark um before we come to the end I
[51:46] want to get one thing out because I'm
[51:49] aware we're entering a little bit of a
[51:50] bull market and I think the ratio of new
[51:54] people uh will slowly start in the
[51:57] Bitcoin podcast so uh I I try to get
[51:59] also some beginner questions in um uh
[52:03] and with that is like what is your most
[52:06] important Bitcoin lesson that you have
[52:09] learned as you are now what is it 11
[52:12] years as you s told you since 2013 here
[52:15] what is the most important lesson uh in
[52:18] in Bitcoin uh for for someone that is
[52:21] maybe a little bit newer well maybe two
[52:23] things one that absolute scarcity has
[52:27] been created and I mean absolute
[52:30] scarcity nothing else in the world is
[52:32] scarce not your Coastal property or your
[52:35] gold or your silver or or anything else
[52:38] so that's
[52:40] unique and then the second thing is that
[52:44] it it brings back the power to The
[52:47] Sovereign to the person you could also
[52:49] say you know the division of money and
[52:51] state so basically you as an
[52:55] individual will now have 12 words in
[52:59] your head where you're basically your
[53:01] own Central Bank and you own your own IP
[53:07] your own property your own sovereignity
[53:09] your own property rights and nobody else
[53:11] can take that off you so that's never
[53:15] happened before as well you know whether
[53:16] you're cross Borders or not so that's
[53:19] putting the world upside down you know
[53:22] everything now is sort of centralistic
[53:24] communistic you know power grab power
[53:28] coming together but now it's
[53:31] decentral open source uh immutable money
[53:35] for everyone can never be stopped can
[53:37] never be colluded can never be taken
[53:38] away and so every for let's say the new
[53:42] podcasters if if there's something it's
[53:44] it's basically they get to own their own
[53:47] you know their property rights will be
[53:49] protected and they get to own their own
[53:51] money it's it's a bearer asset it's
[53:54] nobody else's you know that's another
[53:55] important thing it's it's yours no one
[53:59] else's if you have those 12 words in
[54:00] your head then forever and and a day you
[54:03] will uh will own that and that's never
[54:07] happened
[54:08] before I think that's that's really
[54:10] powerful also it kind of has the chance
[54:13] that it brings I mean there's this
[54:16] concept of like Bitcoin bringing
[54:19] abundance uh to do do you subscribe to
[54:22] that that that Bitcoin is kind of
[54:24] ushering abundance yes yes
[54:27] on LinkedIn on my profile I've sort of
[54:29] given myself a name and that name is
[54:31] creating abundance so I guess everything
[54:33] I do is about abundance and abundance is
[54:36] everything it's not just abundance in
[54:38] wealth or in money but abundance is
[54:41] abundance in ideas abundance in time
[54:43] abundance in uh you know sharing love
[54:46] creating uh stuff you know uh and and so
[54:50] Bitcoin is also a form of
[54:53] abundance um and uh yeah we will see in
[54:57] 10 or 20 years one Bitcoin being worth
[54:59] $1 million that's a form of uh abundance
[55:04] but also that it allows you to become a
[55:07] sovereign again and that your property
[55:10] rights are forever yours that's
[55:12] abundance so it's it's it's filled with
[55:15] abundance so uh
[55:18] yeah talk about for
[55:21] hours um one question that I ask every
[55:25] one of my guests is uh what can we learn
[55:27] from you besides Bitcoin well it's
[55:30] basically what we said I guess that um
[55:34] or the most powerful thing I think I
[55:36] could say is follow your passion and
[55:40] follow it as long as it is your
[55:42] passion and that will you know give you
[55:45] a fulfilled life it will also lead to
[55:47] abundance whether you are interested in
[55:50] in working with the soil or you're
[55:52] interested in uh creating ice cream or
[55:55] you're interested in uh being an opera
[55:57] singer if you follow your passion uh you
[56:00] will be uh uh excellent you know you
[56:03] will be exceptional and PE that's maybe
[56:06] 5,000 years when the Bitcoin uh has done
[56:09] its thing then we will transact in in in
[56:12] basically abundance or in in value add
[56:15] so if you're an opera singer then
[56:17] basically that is what you do that's
[56:19] your mission in life and that's how you
[56:20] get fulfilled and that's how you uh
[56:23] transact so uh yeah would be I mean it
[56:27] took me a long time to find out that
[56:29] that was a really important rule but it
[56:32] it works really well and it uh gives you
[56:35] a fulfilling life so that would be my my
[56:38] oneliner one really really cool I love
[56:40] it a lot um perfect then we come to end
[56:42] routin where the previous guest previous
[56:45] uh guest asked a question for the next
[56:47] guest without knowing who the next guest
[56:49] actually is and your question from the
[56:51] previous guest is how would you
[56:53] recommend buying Bitcoin for kids under
[56:56] the age of 18 it's a oddly specific
[56:58] question but his uh his aim was because
[57:02] uh they cannot even pursue the KC route
[57:05] because it's not allowed in in some
[57:07] countries or in most countries to buy
[57:09] stocks or Bitcoin under 18 uh yeah how
[57:14] would you do that well by educating the
[57:17] parents of the kids and then getting the
[57:20] parents to set aside a an account for
[57:25] the kids uh and buy some Bitcoin on it
[57:28] and then we come to another little topic
[57:30] that we didn't discuss today but one of
[57:32] the eight Wonders of the World by Albert
[57:35] Einstein which is compound interest you
[57:38] know interest on interest and that's the
[57:40] biggest biggest Wonder in the world as
[57:42] well so it fits nicely with creating
[57:46] abundance but if those parents would
[57:48] just save a few set satosi for for their
[57:52] kids and leave it for 18 years I mean I
[57:55] think
[57:56] resolved a lot of the world's problems
[57:59] you know we be a huge amount uh creating
[58:01] abundance and uh compound interest would
[58:04] would you know even if it would be let's
[58:07] say A1 EUR or call it 10 EUR and then
[58:11] the kids get to uh use that 18 years
[58:15] from now the € 10 EUR it's more likely
[58:18] to be 100,000 or maybe a few million
[58:21] euros worth so uh that would be one way
[58:25] of doing it I think
[58:27] uh I love that answer a lot yeah
[58:29] compound interest is something magical
[58:32] it's it's if you get the power of that
[58:35] you uh you you really start uh dealing
[58:39] with your money differently that's right
[58:41] and don't know if we have time but
[58:43] metaphor works really well and a great
[58:46] metaphor to explain it is let's say a
[58:49] snowball right so you start with let's
[58:51] say call it 100 EUR that's your snowball
[58:55] that's all your investment so you take1
[58:57] Euro that's a snowball a certain size
[59:00] and then you need to think of a uh a
[59:04] nice gradually sloping snow what's it
[59:07] called let's say going down a slope you
[59:09] know it's been snowing and then you
[59:11] slowly roll the snowball down the hill
[59:15] and all youve paid for was the the
[59:16] snowball itself the1 EUR but then the
[59:19] snow comes on the outside and it rolls
[59:22] around but then the next time it rolls
[59:25] around because the Snowballs become
[59:27] bigger you're getting all this free
[59:30] extra uh snow and then it rolls around
[59:34] and so if you have a long yard and it
[59:36] slopes down a couple of hundred meters
[59:38] and it's filled with nice wet snow and
[59:42] the gradient is not too much I mean you
[59:44] could talk about the gradient being the
[59:46] interest rate and uh the sun is not
[59:48] shining too much and you could see the
[59:51] Sun as inflation which is melting the
[59:53] snow you don't want that so the Sun and
[59:56] then you start with this snowball and
[59:58] and you roll it down and let's say it
[59:59] rolls for 100 meters then it will be as
[60:02] big as as a car so but if you compare
[60:05] then the size of a car to something that
[60:07] is not much bigger than your hands
[60:10] you've only paid for this the rest is
[60:12] free and it's been created as a will as
[60:16] a Wonder because it's it's the interest
[60:18] on the interest on the interest on the
[60:20] interest that has created it and the
[60:22] only reason why Warren Buffett is so
[60:24] rich and has Don 200 billion or
[60:27] something probably 190 billion of that
[60:30] is due to that effect the compound
[60:33] interest the 10 other billion is due to
[60:36] him making a good decision you know not
[60:39] making too many mistakes uh having a
[60:41] long time he's got the 60 70 years to
[60:44] compound but but this Wonder uh is not
[60:48] explained at all in University you got
[60:50] to look it up yourself but that's it's
[60:53] free and it's for everyone so even the
[60:55] little kid who gets A1 let's call it a
[60:58] snowball 18 years later he can possibly
[61:02] buy a house if he would have invested it
[61:04] in in Bitcoin or his parents would have
[61:07] so and it's free and it's just by using
[61:10] logic and using uh you know spiritual
[61:13] laws and physical laws and uh it's for
[61:17] everyone I love it a lot really really
[61:19] cool uh yeah thank you so much also for
[61:21] your time um before I let you go where
[61:23] can people find you ask your questions
[61:25] reach out to you uh maybe the easiest on
[61:29] the website
[61:30] www. Amsterdam capital management.com
[61:34] and there's something also about our
[61:35] shares and other products that we we
[61:38] have uh so that's probably the easiest
[61:40] way uh to to get in touch perfect yeah
[61:44] thank you so much uh also thank you so
[61:46] much that for everyone that is watching
[61:48] and listening for joining us today as
[61:49] always I'll be back tomorrow with
[61:51] another episode bye-bye
