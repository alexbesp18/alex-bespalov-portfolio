[00:00] before me there was another girl I think
[00:02] she was like the second or the third
[00:04] girl but they also wanted to stay
[00:05] Anonymous being in a room full of
[00:07] bitcoiners just feels so different I
[00:09] don't take pictures of myself and put it
[00:11] on the social media like it's not
[00:14] something that I'm used to I'm not an
[00:15] influenc I talk with my Army friends and
[00:18] they're like I don't know everything is
[00:19] getting more expensive and I we we'll
[00:22] never afford a house and my salary is
[00:25] not uh good enough and I have to get a
[00:28] second job and whatever but they are not
[00:30] not aware of why is this happening
[00:33] Bitcoin is something where you have to
[00:35] put your ego away I get what you're
[00:37] saying but I think
[00:39] that you are for from Germany or not uh
[00:44] Austria but uh ah okay
[00:47] almost yeah okay I speak a bit
[00:51] of oh that's
[00:55] actually that's why I I noticed that in
[00:57] your email it came in German the the
[01:01] appointment
[01:02] email uh Yes actually because uh my
[01:06] Google is in German like my Google
[01:09] account is set in German
[01:12] so I don't know uh it it it the text
[01:16] message I wrote in English uh but some
[01:19] things are coming in in
[01:21] German I don't know how to I should
[01:24] actually I think I should set it up
[01:27] differently I think it's cool yeah you
[01:30] you said it in the beginning that you uh
[01:33] only want to work for Bitcoin companies
[01:35] now um like why and when did you decide
[01:39] that I was working for a norming company
[01:42] here in Chile in the marketing
[01:43] department I was like marketing
[01:45] coordinator but mostly working with the
[01:47] social media and stuff and um I don't
[01:52] know I kind of got a bit tired of it
[01:54] even though I learned a lot with them
[01:57] like they were nice people and all there
[02:00] are some things that I I I just think
[02:02] that are ER in the Fiat culture That You
[02:06] Don't See in the Bitcoin culture
[02:09] and I wanted to search for that and
[02:14] also um I wanted to to have more time to
[02:18] do my art so this job was a full-time
[02:21] job and it was going like more than full
[02:24] time and I wanted ER I decided last year
[02:28] like I want to go back to my art I was I
[02:31] don't know I think I was like for one
[02:34] year I I couldn't make a new piece or
[02:36] something like that and I said like this
[02:38] is not possible like I I need to make my
[02:40] art and so I wanted to to look for
[02:44] part-time jobs and since I was going to
[02:46] to just start looking for them like I
[02:49] quit my job and I said okay now I'm
[02:51] gonna search for them I I decided to
[02:55] search in the Bitcoin Community First
[02:56] like I I think that's um once because
[03:00] you learn so much and because I'm
[03:03] already obsessed with Bitcoin so I think
[03:05] it's like putting it to a better use
[03:08] that only in my head you know yeah so
[03:11] it's an interesting uh approach because
[03:14] a lot of people are trying to First
[03:16] figure out what are they doing before
[03:18] they leave the job like they are like
[03:19] searching for parttime jobs or searching
[03:21] for like but you just took the step and
[03:23] like I want to be uh not working there
[03:27] and then I will search for it like I
[03:29] think it's a brave step it wasn't easy
[03:32] but I I have a lot of uh support um at
[03:36] the moment I was going through like kind
[03:39] of as I was living with someone and then
[03:41] I moved back with my parents so it was
[03:44] like everything was changing and uh they
[03:48] they are helping me a lot and they said
[03:49] like now is the time for you to do what
[03:51] you want and what you love and and
[03:54] that's I think that's the main reason
[03:56] what I was able to to make the decision
[03:59] even though it was hard to make at the
[04:01] moment H with all the support and all it
[04:03] was like is this stupid or not like am I
[04:07] doing the right thing here but H it's
[04:11] turning out very good so I'm very happy
[04:15] and now you are working uh at love is
[04:17] Bitcoin as a community manager As I
[04:20] understood it uh you are working with
[04:22] panties for Bitcoin uh you are having
[04:25] your own arts store do I miss
[04:28] anything no
[04:30] I mean I'm always looking for some
[04:33] collaborations and er Sometimes some
[04:36] Brands want to do something with art but
[04:39] I don't know if I can talk about that
[04:42] yet because it's not ready but I'm
[04:44] hoping yes that that will be out very
[04:48] soon and and if anyone wants to do like
[04:51] a collaboration I'm very happy I really
[04:53] like I think that uh when two people or
[04:56] more like come together to work it's
[04:58] always uh uh something good comes out of
[05:01] out of it like uh we we each one of us
[05:05] has their own perspective and together
[05:08] we can build something much uh I don't
[05:11] know like greater or something yeah
[05:14] that's that's one of the main points why
[05:16] I start the podcast because I think uh
[05:18] when when two or three one podcast I
[05:21] already did with three people um Minds
[05:24] come together and have an focused
[05:27] discussion like one hour two hours 30
[05:30] minutes it depends to time um all
[05:33] there's always some unique things coming
[05:35] out and every and you're now actually my
[05:38] 20th guest uh and uh I always learn
[05:42] something new I always have some new
[05:45] thing and it's like it's a beautiful
[05:47] perspective that when people are coming
[05:49] together talking with each other there's
[05:51] something coming out or collaboration
[05:53] working together so I like that um maybe
[05:56] let's start with the lest Bitcoin
[05:58] Channel because I think I think this is
[06:00] the maybe with panties for Bitcoin the
[06:03] most known uh thing the love is Bitcoin
[06:06] X Channel I think almost everybody saw
[06:09] it at least once when he was in in the
[06:13] Bitcoin Community it has 15,000
[06:16] followers uh it's really really really
[06:19] active a lot of posts are coming out
[06:22] today before interview I scroll a little
[06:24] bit through what are you posting and I'm
[06:26] like wow it's like hard to get to the to
[06:29] the yes yesterday post because there's a
[06:30] lot of posts and reposts going on um and
[06:34] a lot of people I think don't even know
[06:36] that there is like a team of five people
[06:38] uh a lot of people are also surprised
[06:40] that that the founder of Love is Bitcoin
[06:43] is a man I think everybody assumes it's
[06:45] like only one person and a woman behind
[06:48] it um what's the story about love is
[06:52] Bitcoin and what are you doing there
[06:55] yeah um George is one of the founders uh
[06:58] there are other founders I I don't quite
[07:00] remember if they want to stay Anonymous
[07:03] but uh I think it's it was founded also
[07:06] with a woman but George is very publicly
[07:10] about his image and and his account and
[07:14] before me I I've been working with them
[07:16] for like six months and before me there
[07:20] was another girl like doing the the
[07:22] social media and all and I think she was
[07:26] like the second or the third girl but
[07:28] they also wanted to stay Anonymous so
[07:31] that was a bit controversial because
[07:32] people didn't know who was talking or
[07:35] couldn't put a face into this character
[07:38] and so when I started talking to George
[07:41] um he asked me like would you be willing
[07:43] to be um more than just managing the
[07:47] account but to be the face and voice of
[07:50] liby who is a character um and I was
[07:54] like that was super challenging for me
[07:57] like I'm not a like it's it's
[07:59] embarrassing for me like I'm not a very
[08:02] I don't take pictures of myself and put
[08:04] it on the social media like it's not
[08:07] something that I'm used to I'm not an
[08:09] influencer but uh I thought that it
[08:12] would be like a very good lesson for me
[08:14] like to learn this to to to acquire new
[08:17] skills to be less um I don't know like
[08:20] um how do you call it like I have like
[08:23] stage frighten like sometimes I'm afraid
[08:26] of talking in public or something like
[08:28] that this has helped me a lot because uh
[08:32] since I'm an artist I think it's
[08:34] important to be able to to communicate
[08:36] to talk about your your work to um
[08:39] expose yourself and this helps the the
[08:43] projects you do like get to other people
[08:45] like I understand how social media works
[08:48] like people want to connect so if you
[08:49] don't show yourself it's really hard um
[08:52] so I think that that was the most
[08:54] challenging part but I'm happy that uh
[08:57] that I um I don't know that that that
[09:00] this came through in my path and now I'm
[09:03] I'm learning and I'm I'm trying to get
[09:06] better every day and you also have your
[09:09] own Channel with like a three or 4,000
[09:11] followers on X and you have like your
[09:14] own art uh store so like it's it's
[09:18] you're not completely hidden by now
[09:20] right you're like giving you more and
[09:22] more uh out there yeah because um I
[09:26] really want uh to to to try my best in
[09:30] my art and I think that one part is like
[09:35] how do you get people to see it and what
[09:39] I I realized that all that I had learned
[09:43] like in marketing and social media I
[09:45] wasn't doing for myself H because I was
[09:49] like kind of embarrassed or whatever and
[09:52] uh now I'm trying to to like do that and
[09:55] and in my own account like post more but
[09:58] if you see like I'm I'm not you are not
[10:02] going to find many like pictures of
[10:04] myself like I'm in my social media I'm
[10:07] more used to post about the work or like
[10:10] thoughts or or like repost other other
[10:12] people works because I I want this
[10:15] channel to be about art and not not
[10:18] about me even though I'm I'm learning
[10:20] that that's also part of of it you
[10:23] know and when did you actually got first
[10:26] into Bitcoin like was it uh
[10:29] you you that had your fear job and you
[10:32] learned about Bitcoin before you made
[10:34] the switch to the Bitcoin companies
[10:37] right
[10:38] yes um
[10:41] so I I learned about Bitcoin through my
[10:45] family actually um I live in Chile and
[10:50] at the time my I I was living with my
[10:53] parents I was studying um and my dad
[10:58] since like more than 20 years has been
[11:01] working for the same company which is a
[11:02] German company so um we we always had
[11:07] like that TR that problem of moving the
[11:09] money around like this his salary for us
[11:11] to live and uh so when Bitcoin started
[11:16] like to get a bit bigger I don't know
[11:18] like he he went he start he started
[11:21] learning about it and he figured that
[11:23] this would be like a very good tool to
[11:25] like if you could with the Euros uh buy
[11:28] the Bitcoin Kraken and then sell it in
[11:30] Chile for pesos you're moving your
[11:33] salary without the banks and and many of
[11:37] this uh like er complications and paying
[11:41] less for it and that's when when like
[11:45] the whole family started learning more
[11:46] about bcoin and my brother uh I don't
[11:49] know I think at the time was studying
[11:51] engineer like he's a software engineer
[11:54] so he he was like really interested in
[11:56] the technical aspects of it and I don't
[11:59] know I I was learning through osmosis
[12:02] you know like I didn't get it but they
[12:04] were talking about it all the time and
[12:07] um you start like like questioning like
[12:10] what is that and and then they said like
[12:14] okay this is like when they got my
[12:16] attention was like now you have to start
[12:18] reading for yourself like we have
[12:20] explained a lot and and for me like
[12:23] reading some books wasn't actually that
[12:26] hard because I had all
[12:30] been like taught about this even though
[12:32] I'm not a te technological person or I
[12:35] don't come from that world and yeah uh
[12:39] and then in like 2020
[12:42] or near uh like the pandemic and all is
[12:46] when I started doing my art in Bitcoin
[12:48] that came first and I realized that when
[12:51] I'm doing the art pieces I'm trying to
[12:54] understand Bitcoin even more and I I am
[12:57] very obsessed about the the
[12:59] philosophical aspects or or how this
[13:01] will shape our society or how like how
[13:04] is this changing the way we behave the
[13:07] way we think and and yeah that's that's
[13:12] what interests me the most even though
[13:14] uh the code and I think it's beautiful
[13:18] as it is um I'm more attracted about how
[13:21] is this going to impact society and then
[13:25] last year I started looking for uh
[13:28] Bitcoin job yeah and how do you how do
[13:32] you think it will impact Society the the
[13:36] Bitcoin yes I I really think this is
[13:39] like a like a ground layer if you think
[13:42] of a house I think Bitcoin is in the
[13:46] base like in where you put your
[13:48] foundations so if you don't have strong
[13:51] foundations everything in the house will
[13:53] have a problem but when you are building
[13:56] strong foundations this will also impact
[13:59] in all your house even in the latest
[14:03] floor or the roof or whatever so I think
[14:07] it's impossible for it not to have an
[14:09] impact and I think we are seeing it like
[14:12] I think when I talk to bitcoiners and
[14:15] how er the the the way they're thinking
[14:19] is different and understanding where the
[14:21] problems comes makes you allows you to
[14:25] take different decisions you know like I
[14:28] talk with my my friends and they're like
[14:30] I don't know everything is getting
[14:32] expensive more expensive and I we
[14:35] will'll never afford the house and my
[14:38] salary is not uh good enough and I have
[14:40] to get a second job and whatever but
[14:43] they are not aware of why is this
[14:46] happening so the decisions they'll make
[14:50] won't probably fix the problem you know
[14:53] yeah and I
[14:54] think I have a lot of thoughts about
[14:56] that and uh for me like bit coin in the
[14:59] purest form is just money um but you can
[15:04] clearly see that every Bitcoin has an
[15:06] extremely unique personality and uh
[15:09] being in a room full of bitcoiners just
[15:11] feels so different in being in a room
[15:14] from like not
[15:16] bitcoiners um
[15:18] and sometimes I think maybe it's because
[15:22] Bitcoin is something where you have to
[15:24] put your ego away and because you have
[15:27] to put your ego away and learn something
[15:29] and you have to deal with it that you
[15:32] did not buy in 2011 and did you not buy
[15:35] in
[15:36] 2015 uh and you bought at like 60,000
[15:39] maybe and and you might be angry at
[15:43] yourself because like you missed out on
[15:45] a lot of opportunity but then you
[15:47] realize oh it's it's actually a
[15:49] really really really good asset and
[15:51] money and because you have to be really
[15:54] curious you have to be really
[15:55] open-minded you have to be really you
[15:57] have to put your ego side and I think
[16:00] this is why the Bitcoin Community is
[16:02] right now so amazing because we just in
[16:07] a really early stage also I'm wondering
[16:10] how if if this is going through Society
[16:14] completely and will actually change
[16:16] society or if we are just an a small
[16:20] group that is just just different
[16:23] because we early and we discovered it
[16:25] and because also I don't know if
[16:28] everybody will use Bitcoin the way we
[16:30] are using it right now and being so
[16:32] deeply ingrained in it um maybe people
[16:35] will use it on layer 10 and don't even
[16:39] know that Bitcoin is like the groundwork
[16:41] like they they're living in the The
[16:43] Penthouse floor of the in in the
[16:46] building and don't even know what's in
[16:48] the in the basement uh so uh what do you
[16:51] think about that yeah I get what you're
[16:54] saying but I think that if you think
[16:56] about it right now people don't
[16:58] understand what money is and maybe don't
[17:01] comprehend what fat is but it's still
[17:03] shaping the way they behave like it's
[17:05] changing your time preference it is
[17:08] changing like how we consume this uh
[17:11] this need to get rid of it fast is is
[17:14] imposed by by how this Technologies has
[17:18] been designed so I think that's that
[17:20] even though you might not know in the
[17:23] future like exactly what beIN is or you
[17:26] maybe people won't
[17:27] care uh I think that it's it's setting
[17:31] this this layer on like on the bottom
[17:35] where we can enable this other way of of
[17:38] behaving like this low time preference
[17:41] and and
[17:42] maybe much more things like when you
[17:45] think about it it's crazy that today we
[17:47] work for money that someone else is
[17:50] printing for free so um and I'm I'm I
[17:53] know that money is just money in a way
[17:56] but also it's like um how would you
[17:59] describe a society like when when does a
[18:03] group of humans become a society um and
[18:07] I think that ER there are like a few
[18:10] things that might make the difference I
[18:14] think one of those is money like the the
[18:16] ability to transact with one another and
[18:20] H to create this technology um it's for
[18:23] me ER one of the first things you need
[18:27] to have in order to have a society so I
[18:30] I can't see that this is not going to
[18:33] have a bigger impact you know yeah it's
[18:36] it's beautiful because I already had two
[18:38] guests on that said uh the same exact
[18:40] thing without knowing each other
[18:42] actually and it's uh Bitcoin is a system
[18:45] based on love uh because if you have a
[18:49] system that's completely trustless you
[18:51] like you don't even have to trust it you
[18:53] know
[18:54] the financial energy you transact as as
[18:57] you said it in your early um in your
[19:00] early example from Germany to Chile uh
[19:04] you can rely on that it's actually
[19:07] coming to the right address nobody can
[19:10] put a stop on it like there's no uh feed
[19:14] institution in between and saying oh but
[19:17] what where is this 20,000 actually
[19:19] coming from I don't I don't want to deal
[19:21] with it right now like please fill out
[19:24] those five forms and then maybe we
[19:26] transact your your money do Chile
[19:29] because let's let's make sure it's
[19:31] safe and Bitcoin doesn't have this it's
[19:34] it's trust li like you you can just
[19:36] transact it and another big part as you
[19:39] also mentioned is um when you hold
[19:42] Bitcoin and Bitcoin is the standard form
[19:44] of our financial energy um your money
[19:48] gets more over time like your your
[19:52] iPhone is getting cheaper every year
[19:55] your bananas are getting cheaper every
[19:57] year so in inally we are having uh we
[20:01] just know that when we don't spend today
[20:04] tomorrow we have a little bit more and
[20:06] now intrinsically we know when we don't
[20:09] spend today we have less tomorrow and uh
[20:12] you're completely right this will uh
[20:15] change society and we have a lot of
[20:16] examples of that that uh Society on a
[20:20] sound money standard uh is a better one
[20:23] it's just like if you have a healthy
[20:25] money you have a healthy Society like
[20:27] you you're 100% right but um yeah so
[20:32] like it's it's just money but money does
[20:34] something with us yeah so I completely
[20:37] agree with you yeah I don't think that
[20:40] Bitcoin will fix everything but I think
[20:43] that
[20:44] uh this uh it will produce like a
[20:47] movement on everything you know like
[20:50] maybe it won't th we we are like fixing
[20:53] this round ground layer and then we
[20:55] will'll have to face Maybe other
[20:57] problems but uh I think that today we
[21:01] are trying to fix like small things that
[21:04] we see on top without uh like taking
[21:07] care of the real disease you know so
[21:09] it's like when you put uh I don't know
[21:11] if like covering your wounds with makeup
[21:13] like that doesn't fix the problem like
[21:16] you might seem like look like you're
[21:19] okay and healthy but actually you are
[21:21] not curing the the the wound you know
[21:25] your store is called ungovernable
[21:28] I I'm Austria I'm not native English I
[21:31] I'm having a hard time for some reason
[21:33] to speak it out but but I know what it
[21:37] means um what does it mean for you and
[21:40] and why did you pick exactly this
[21:44] word yes I didn't want to go with uh my
[21:47] like my name like my artist I it's very
[21:51] weird like in my social media or
[21:53] whatever I'm always FL Montoya but I
[21:56] sign my art with both my last names in
[22:00] Chile we have one last name from your
[22:02] father and the other from the mother and
[22:05] so I like to put them both so my art is
[22:07] actually signed Montoya salvadores so I
[22:11] thought between those those two things
[22:14] it's like too many words it's like too
[22:18] hard maybe to pronounce in like if it's
[22:20] coming from Spanish and then I don't
[22:22] know and then I wanted to make it like
[22:25] more of a brand in a way because I I
[22:28] wanted my website not to be just about
[22:30] me but to be about the art and and
[22:33] hopefully about many collaborations that
[22:35] I hopefully get to make in the future so
[22:39] um I I was looking for a word that would
[22:42] describe how I feel right now and what I
[22:47] want is uh for us to be less govern
[22:52] Gobles um and I think Bitcoin is helping
[22:56] us to to because we are obtaining the
[22:59] this self sovereignity um we are
[23:03] becoming less governable and I don't
[23:05] think that's a I think that's a good
[23:07] thing like when they it's like when they
[23:09] say um I I recently saw B of Vendetta
[23:14] again and it's like when he
[23:17] says
[23:19] uh the the the people shouldn't be
[23:22] afraid of the government but the
[23:24] government should be afraid of the
[23:25] people um I think that's how things
[23:28] should should work like you are working
[23:31] there for uh for us like for the bigger
[23:35] group if you want to be there like it's
[23:37] it's optional nobody put you on top of
[23:40] there you want to make the decisions
[23:43] okay go make them but make them for
[23:45] everyone not for you and I don't see
[23:47] that happening right now um I I see a
[23:50] small group of of people uh like
[23:56] um like like they are using the the the
[24:00] bigger group you know um and uh I don't
[24:05] not necessarily talking about
[24:06] governments but uh everything like the
[24:08] elected and the Not Elected people like
[24:10] there's a small group like trying to
[24:13] Rule the World um I'm very afraid of
[24:18] these World coin ideas and yeah I I it's
[24:22] an invitation to be more ungovernable to
[24:25] break the rules to opt out to don't care
[24:29] to yeah yeah yeah yeah for me also like
[24:32] a government should be more like a
[24:34] service like you should um government
[24:36] should be here for the people and
[24:39] service what the people want from them
[24:41] like if if we have uh if we all the
[24:44] people decide oh we have we want
[24:47] government to take care of kids during
[24:50] school then it's okay but if people say
[24:52] like oh I don't want my kid in the
[24:55] school like there are a lot of
[24:56] bitcoiners that are Al homeschoolers
[24:59] that's also an option and it's it kind
[25:02] of was flipped around because now
[25:04] there's like government saying the
[25:06] people what to do and not the people
[25:08] saying the government what to do like
[25:10] the the whole system is kind of flipped
[25:12] around in like my first principes way of
[25:15] thinking it should be like there they're
[25:18] like why is government existing at all
[25:20] like the qu question like for me it's uh
[25:24] things everybody needs uh
[25:28] can be more efficiently organized if
[25:32] it's the centralized group for example
[25:34] roads everybody uses roads with the car
[25:38] with like Street walks and stuff like
[25:40] that that that's okay if it's
[25:42] centralized Bland uh but it's a service
[25:46] that's there for the people the people
[25:48] are the the customers the clients that
[25:51] they are the the the the the Kings
[25:54] basically like for me is always the the
[25:56] person that that's like the the the
[25:59] guest that comes in in the restaurant
[26:00] that's the king like and the and the
[26:03] people serving the food they should
[26:04] serve the food to him and not like it's
[26:06] not like a privilege like there's no
[26:09] there's no restaurant in the world where
[26:11] the cook comes out and like you eat this
[26:13] today and you have to pay this Euros no
[26:18] it's the the the the guest says oh I
[26:20] want to eat this today and uh and this
[26:23] is the priz for it like the priz
[26:25] obviously is from the restaurant but uh
[26:27] chooses basically from what he is eating
[26:29] like it's it's just flipped around for
[26:31] me so I I really like that word I really
[26:33] like the the the mission was what what
[26:36] you were saying from
[26:38] that um and you obviously know the
[26:40] Bitcoin Community very well like you uh
[26:43] with three different Bitcoin companies
[26:46] or one is your own and you're working
[26:48] with collaborations you're a lot on
[26:50] Twitter I guess when you're the
[26:51] community manager of lest Bitcoin um
[26:55] what are some typical Properties or
[26:58] typical um character trades of a
[27:02] bitcoiner what what would you say is the
[27:05] the typical bitcoiner in in your world
[27:08] and why are there there
[27:11] are not so many women as there should be
[27:15] I think that ER what I see like a very
[27:20] common bitcoiner is
[27:23] someone who has like a I think that's
[27:26] it's people who is very open like people
[27:28] who are open to new ideas even though it
[27:31] might seem not like it's not that way
[27:33] because sometimes bitcoiners get like
[27:37] really how how do you say like uh like
[27:40] it's focused and I don't know if you if
[27:43] you talking about a shitcoin then
[27:45] they're like no that's not
[27:48] uh like angry or or something like that
[27:51] like very
[27:53] reactive uh but I know that in the in in
[27:57] like in their personalities it's people
[27:59] that's very open to new ideas that's why
[28:01] that's the only way to to embrace
[28:03] Bitcoin is to be open to a new idea
[28:06] because you were you were raised in a
[28:08] society that told you things are this
[28:11] way and things has have always been like
[28:14] this for like more than 200 years or
[28:17] whatever um so to be open to break that
[28:21] uh you have to have an open
[28:23] mind and then H this this other other uh
[28:28] thing that you see when they are like
[28:30] very reactive is because they're
[28:32] protecting the this thing that they
[28:34] found that is so important and it's like
[28:39] this analogy when I think was Michael
[28:42] saor said like it's like the Cyber
[28:44] Hornets that makes sense like if you
[28:46] find something that's you see it's
[28:49] beautiful it it it has the properties to
[28:52] to make so many lives better to improve
[28:57] ER how humans ER yeah live um why
[29:02] wouldn't you protect it why wouldn't you
[29:04] be like defensive and I also like a lot
[29:07] that property about bitcoiners I really
[29:10] like that when you are in a in a like a
[29:15] more friendly environment or something
[29:17] they're really funny I love that
[29:19] bitcoiners are like the kings of memes
[29:21] like nobody memes like bitcoiners um I'm
[29:25] learning uh I have a lot of supporting
[29:27] the team for Lis Bitcoin ER and it's
[29:31] impressive like so many ideas all the
[29:33] time like so much creativity that's also
[29:36] very very cool like I think Bitcoin
[29:39] pushes you to to your to to use your
[29:42] creativity a lot um in any aspect like
[29:45] if you are in the mining sector you
[29:47] might want to find a better resource and
[29:50] and getting cheaper energy or whatever
[29:53] and if you're are coding you have to I
[29:56] don't know uh fix that BG or I don't
[29:58] know it's like always pushing creativity
[30:00] and I think that H bitcoiners might be
[30:03] the most creative people in the world
[30:05] like the people who is embracing this
[30:07] right now when it's not obvious because
[30:09] in the future it will be like oh of
[30:11] course we trust in Bitcoin or or we
[30:13] believe in this but the people who are
[30:16] seeing this right now um I think it must
[30:20] be like like I said like very
[30:22] open-minded but also very very creative
[30:25] and I'm feeling like uh as I'm as I'm
[30:28] saying this um a bit like I'm I'm
[30:31] feeling super blessed to be in this in
[30:34] this group and I know for me I feel like
[30:36] it was just a lack you know I wasn't
[30:39] looking for this I just happen to have a
[30:42] family who is very curious um I think
[30:44] that my dad is always these kind of
[30:46] people who like Embraces new things like
[30:48] who wants to study my my brother as well
[30:52] they are more technological and yeah I
[30:55] feel very blessed to be in this to to
[30:58] call myself Bitcoin or to meet new
[31:00] people who is doing so so different so
[31:03] much different things and and yes I
[31:06] think that's a an an extremely accurate
[31:10] description of a bitcoiner because they
[31:13] they usually have uh like they're all
[31:16] different like uh like I have now like
[31:19] 20 people on the podcast and I could ask
[31:22] the same T questions to everybody and it
[31:24] would be an extremely unique um
[31:26] conversation and conversation worthwhile
[31:29] everybody is so unique but they have one
[31:32] thing in common for me it's curiosity
[31:34] and open-mindedness is like the the if
[31:37] if you Bitcoin is for me the only
[31:39] Community where an vegan and a carnivore
[31:43] can sit next to each other and don't
[31:45] kill each other like it's like like a
[31:48] carnivore who eats only meat and then
[31:50] and and vegan that only eats like non uh
[31:55] meat stuff non Stu that's that's the
[31:59] most craziest thing ever when you see
[32:02] those people together because they have
[32:03] completely different mindset
[32:07] uh opinions about one specific topic and
[32:10] in Bitcoin it kind of Unites us uh
[32:13] although we are so different in so such
[32:15] unique
[32:16] personalities and for the my second part
[32:19] of the question uh it's it's I'm on the
[32:22] hunt uh um to finding more women in the
[32:27] Bitcoin space it's it's uh not easy like
[32:32] I have you're now my second from 20 so
[32:36] that's really bad bad for me but I'm
[32:39] really searching um like why why do you
[32:43] think uh it's maybe harder for women or
[32:47] girls to to come into the space or how
[32:50] can we improve on that I I'll redirect
[32:53] you some amazing girls in the space like
[32:57] you have to interview them because there
[32:59] is so much talent in so much there are a
[33:02] lot of women doing different stuff like
[33:06] from the art scene to everything and um
[33:11] I think that I cannot speak for everyone
[33:14] but I think that we have might have been
[33:16] raised to think that technology is for
[33:20] boys in a way um in my case that was
[33:24] actually true like I really always
[33:27] thought that I wouldn't be able to
[33:29] understand it and then he was like yeah
[33:32] maybe you can maybe you and you start
[33:35] reading and and learning about it and
[33:37] yeah maybe I'm not like very passionate
[33:39] about the technology in general but uh
[33:43] I'm able to learn it and uh I think that
[33:47] we have to start breaking those those
[33:50] like walls um because otherwise we'll be
[33:54] losing so much talent from people who
[33:57] has their unique perspective and and
[33:59] life experience who can bring so much to
[34:02] this space and someone who is doing
[34:06] something like that that I'm I'm really
[34:09] impressed of her work is H Christa
[34:12] Edmunds I think she's from London I
[34:15] don't know if you know her but she lives
[34:17] in Canada or or is working there I think
[34:21] and she's doing uh it's a like a site
[34:25] it's called Uh access tribe and she's
[34:30] not only like helping woman to empower
[34:33] themselves she's doing this online
[34:35] courses where you can learn and teach
[34:37] from different uh topics um many are
[34:42] Bitcoin focused but sometimes it's
[34:45] something different like I don't know
[34:48] and um she's creating like a like a a
[34:54] community of woman ER and I think that
[34:57] she's also trying to raise like capital
[35:00] for this uh for women who are building
[35:03] their own companies uh in the Bitcoin
[35:06] space so uh there are things happening
[35:08] and I think you're are going to start to
[35:10] see much more ladies in the space I hope
[35:15] so yes it's definitely needed um for me
[35:19] personally I uh like obviously I know
[35:23] way more um boys and mens in in my
[35:26] personal life because like friends and
[35:28] stuff like I think that's natural for
[35:31] woman to know more woman and for men to
[35:32] know more men I don't know if it's that
[35:34] of course there are exceptions of that
[35:36] but at least for me it's like that um
[35:39] and I have a way harder time to uh or
[35:42] let's take like like that um if I tell
[35:46] someone like man or boy in my in my
[35:50] sphere about Bitcoin um there are
[35:55] sometimes even like uh little bit like
[35:57] oh yes yes I know about Bitcoin like
[35:59] they even though they don't know
[36:01] anything about Bitcoin they say they
[36:03] know everything and they're like they
[36:04] they're super confident about it and
[36:06] they're like oh let's let's let's do it
[36:09] and there there are some of them that I
[36:11] speak five minutes about them Bitcoin
[36:13] and they're like like how can I buy it
[36:16] and then then yes download this wallet I
[36:19] buy some Bitcoin for you transfer to you
[36:21] like they're really like instantly in
[36:23] doing it um maybe it's because I have
[36:27] don't have the good connection but uh I
[36:29] find it harder with orange billing
[36:32] girls like but that maybe it's just
[36:36] me I don't know um for examp from my
[36:41] group of friends uh I haven't been too
[36:44] successful in the orange pilling
[36:47] but um for example there was
[36:51] um a a couple that I orange ped uh and
[36:56] he was i w i remember I was very
[36:59] obsessed about bco because now I try to
[37:01] talk about it when people are asking
[37:03] more than just trying to bring that up
[37:06] but at the moment I was like this is
[37:07] crazy you have to know about this and
[37:09] like going on and all and the price was
[37:13] like about
[37:15] 8,000 dollars per Bitcoin and he was
[37:19] like no that thing is a scam and I don't
[37:21] know blah blah blah and she was like way
[37:23] more open like don't explain it to me
[37:25] like I don't want to understand but I
[37:27] kind of feel like you're telling me
[37:29] something that is true and then they
[37:32] were like no no no we're not going to
[37:33] buy we're not going to buy so that that
[37:35] was in the last bull market so the price
[37:38] started to go up and next time he was
[37:42] like okay maybe this is not a scam but
[37:44] it's I don't know another critique and
[37:46] then another and he was like accepting
[37:48] it like piece by piece and when he was
[37:52] like okay we're going to buy it was like
[37:54] the Tob of the past full
[37:57] market and then I I told him like this
[38:00] is a um because I when when people
[38:03] starting like I don't say like you have
[38:06] to hle forever or something like that
[38:08] because I think people don't understand
[38:10] that at the beginning so I tell him you
[38:12] have to at least huddle for like four to
[38:15] eight years to see like a um like you're
[38:19] winning in in terms of dollar you know
[38:23] uh in the hope that in that time he will
[38:25] the person will start learning more and
[38:27] get more Curious you know and also
[38:29] because it's like that the it's it's how
[38:32] it is like don't put money you you're
[38:34] going to need
[38:36] tomorrow for food you
[38:38] know so he B at the top and then the
[38:42] bare Market came and he was like super
[38:45] no why did I do this and I told him like
[38:49] do you remember the first time I I spoke
[38:52] to you he was yes it was eight he did
[38:54] remember like it was $8,000 and I
[38:57] up
[38:58] and and yeah and his wife is like super
[39:01] chill like she's like We're going to
[39:03] wait no no problem and he's like
[39:06] suffering because the price is not at
[39:09] the same or more today and she's like um
[39:13] this is long term I don't care like er
[39:16] and yeah I have had that experience with
[39:19] not many people but also other friends
[39:22] like girls are like okay I already did
[39:25] this I'm going to forget about it um not
[39:28] even going to try to learn like I will
[39:30] forget and we'll look it when you tell
[39:32] me and then I try to to
[39:35] to I don't know like micro do the orange
[39:38] pill and I think that's working
[39:41] better yeah I also learned like um right
[39:45] like I was super passionate about orange
[39:48] ping people uh in the beginning in 2020
[39:52] beginning of 2021 also but somewhere in
[39:55] the middle of 202 21 and end of 2021 I
[39:58] was like I don't care anymore like I
[40:03] everybody in my friend and family Circle
[40:06] knows that I'm uh the Bitcoin guy and if
[40:10] they want to learn about Bitcoin they
[40:12] can come anytime like and this is how I
[40:15] approach it right now like if someone
[40:17] shows actual interest and willingness to
[40:21] to learn about Bitcoin of course I'm
[40:23] telling that about them about Bitcoin
[40:25] and what it is and and what it's not uh
[40:28] but they they have to have interest of
[40:32] their own to to to begin with because if
[40:35] they don't if they are not interested in
[40:38] the beginning you will not make them
[40:40] interested in it they have they have to
[40:42] have some motivation of their own
[40:44] because it's just too hard to learn uh
[40:49] with by force like you cannot force
[40:51] someone to learn you like maybe you can
[40:54] spark an interest in them but but then
[40:56] you have to let them go and do their
[40:58] research and then maybe they come back
[40:59] and you can welcome them like I always
[41:03] uh like when
[41:05] when sometimes see a a lot of uh
[41:08] toxicity in the Bitcoin space and I'm I
[41:11] always try to to be like let's welcome
[41:14] them with OP Ms like like I also called
[41:18] Bitcoin a scam in in in 2019 and 2020 I
[41:21] bought and 2021 I went all in uh and I
[41:25] loved how B Community welcomed me and
[41:27] and and how Bitcoin in general welcome
[41:30] me and and I think we should not be oh
[41:33] you said once that your Bitcoin is scam
[41:35] and just we just throwing them out like
[41:40] everybody will come to bitcoin like we
[41:42] will on board the next one billion
[41:44] people in the next few years uh we need
[41:47] a lot of Educators we need a lot of
[41:49] content we need a lot of um
[41:52] infrastructure technology and and
[41:55] ecosystem let's open everybody who is
[41:57] willing to give for the community with
[41:59] open arms and uh let's not forget why we
[42:02] are here to have everybody on board yeah
[42:06] absolutely um we having an end routine
[42:09] on the on the podcast uh where the
[42:12] previous guest asked a question for the
[42:14] next guest uh without knowing who's
[42:16] who's the next guest is and uh your
[42:20] question is an interesting one it opens
[42:22] up a whole different uh uh uh topic
[42:26] uh what is the difference for you
[42:29] between filtering and sensoring is there
[42:32] any difference filtering and sensoring
[42:35] uh I think it might change with the
[42:38] context but
[42:41] um I think that's when you censor
[42:45] something um it's more violent like you
[42:48] have to impose something like it's not
[42:51] on your private self or your space uh
[42:55] it's like if you don't do what I want um
[42:58] you are going to receive like uh
[43:02] punishment and I think that filtering is
[43:04] more like in your own space like this is
[43:08] I what I accept and this is what I not I
[43:10] do not accept I'm not censoring you like
[43:12] go talk your thing go do your your stuff
[43:16] I'm not going to consume it I'm not
[43:18] going to approve it in my private space
[43:22] I I I would
[43:23] say yeah it's uh and think it's those
[43:27] questions are always great
[43:29] because the someone uh gets the question
[43:32] for someone else and they don't know
[43:34] each other and you you don't know what
[43:38] his intention of the question was
[43:42] and neither does he know who gets the
[43:46] aggression but I think the filtering and
[43:48] censoring it's it's sometimes uh people
[43:52] are uh saying oh I want to filter this
[43:55] out I want to focus on that and you know
[43:58] personal scale it's
[43:59] completely fine like you like fine you
[44:02] have to fil out you have to focus like
[44:04] you have to guard your time so heavily
[44:07] like everybody wants a piece of your
[44:09] time everybody wants a piece of
[44:10] everything uh especially if if if your
[44:13] time gets more valuable if your time and
[44:16] and you get more wealthy and you get
[44:18] more um more kind of social status um
[44:24] but even with uh when we are looking at
[44:27] the state level where there's a lot of
[44:29] uh sensoring going on or like a feared
[44:32] uh system there's a lot of sensoring
[44:34] going on and they're also talking about
[44:36] oh we're filtering out stuff we want to
[44:39] filter the bad people out that's just
[44:42] censoring for me like for me there's not
[44:44] a lot like those words are basically the
[44:47] same for me you can say Okay filtering
[44:50] is a personal level that's okay but
[44:52] sensoring is on the state of
[44:54] institutional level uh but basically
[44:57] you're you're filtering someone out and
[45:01] he's not seen if you're doing it for
[45:03] yourself it's recommended because you
[45:06] cannot intake everything uh but if an
[45:10] institution uh does it for financial
[45:13] transaction and they have an mon
[45:14] Monopoly on on it then it's definitely
[45:17] wrong and it should not be what what's
[45:20] your thoughts because you're lot on X
[45:22] and it's just a random question that
[45:24] came up in my head um what's your
[45:26] thoughts about X right now like do you
[45:28] like the changes the last one two years
[45:31] uh how do you like uh X and is is X the
[45:35] the best platform for you or or Twitter
[45:38] is you'll prefer some other platform
[45:42] more no I think I'm there because people
[45:46] are there like people is is making it
[45:49] special um if it coiners were to move to
[45:53] Noster I would love that
[45:56] uh I will be there much much more time
[45:59] like um that's the the difficult thing
[46:02] that everyone has to make that decision
[46:04] like everyone has to move to the next
[46:07] thing in order for it to work and if
[46:10] everyone is waiting for other person to
[46:13] move then nobody
[46:15] moves um but today it's like a it's like
[46:20] my main channel to to connect with
[46:23] bitcoiners and I'm very far away like I
[46:27] I would love to go to more meetups and
[46:29] stuff but like to meet in person that's
[46:31] why I love like conferences I have been
[46:33] very lucky to be in three conferences in
[46:36] my life and um it's very different it's
[46:41] special and I love it but it's really
[46:43] really hard to to participate and here
[46:47] in in my in Chile um we are just
[46:51] starting to make like a bigger group uh
[46:53] to have more meetups but everything is
[46:57] really slow and small so um yeah I think
[47:02] it's more out of
[47:05] necessity yeah it's X is is the place
[47:08] where kind of every bitcoiner is right
[47:10] now it seems like it um where can people
[47:14] find you B basically on a uh your your
[47:17] handle and you're also working at the
[47:19] three different companies where do you

[48:47] just go write us and we are like very
[48:50] open to work with small or big Brands
[48:53] like it's uh for us they only thing is
[48:56] that it's bitcoiner that's all that
[48:58] matters and in panties I'm I'm working
[49:03] like create well with them I'm more
[49:05] behind the scenes I really love it
[49:07] because I'm I'm able to go back behind
[49:09] the camera and take the pictures or or I
[49:12] don't know like I'm trying to work with
[49:14] a team to create ideas for new campaigns
[49:18] and collaborations with other brands and
[49:21] um yeah we're we're working we're doing
[49:24] like some like space places and things
[49:26] like that so that people get to know
[49:29] like the personality of the brand H
[49:32] pantis for Bitcoin for those who don't
[49:33] know is created by a family it's a
[49:37] family company they have always worked
[49:41] in the industry of underwear and one day
[49:44] they were like we want to do something
[49:46] for Bitcoin but what can we do like we
[49:48] have always worked in this industry and
[49:52] then they decided you know what we're
[49:53] only we are going to make a underwear
[49:56] for Bitcoin and it's very cool because I
[50:00] I think it's like a glimpse in the
[50:01] future like um it's like every company
[50:05] will be a Bitcoin company when they say
[50:07] that like you can feel that with panties
[50:09] like they are ER experts and they have H
[50:13] their own value then they want to bring
[50:15] that value what they know to the
[50:18] community and that's um I don't know I
[50:21] think it's very valuable and also if you
[50:24] want to move to a Bitcoin standard you
[50:26] need more Brands like with like regular
[50:29] stuff who we who accept Bitcoin and and
[50:33] are bitcoiners hopefully so I really
[50:35] love what they're doing that's great uh
[50:39] thank you Flo for being on and I hope we
[50:41] can do that in again
[50:43] sometime yeah thank you so much for
[50:45] having me I had a lot of fun
