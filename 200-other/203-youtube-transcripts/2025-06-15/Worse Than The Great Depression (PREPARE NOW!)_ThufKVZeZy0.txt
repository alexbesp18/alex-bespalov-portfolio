[00:00] the suicide rate is is a very easy way
[00:03] to quantify just how hopeless are the
[00:07] people of a country and the last time
[00:09] they were this hopeless was the end of
[00:11] the Great Depression uh since 1970
[00:15] anti-depressant uh prescriptions have uh
[00:17] increased by 13x Outsourcing our job in
[00:22] globalization and in creating a system
[00:24] where we basically put our youth into
[00:27] ever inescapable debt depending on on
[00:30] the data that you're looking at there is
[00:32] an argument to be made that we've
[00:34] actually been living in a silent
[00:36] depression since
[00:39] [Music]
[00:42] 2008 before we jump into the CHS and all
[00:46] the things is like U maybe a little bit
[00:48] uh um how you got started uh with with
[00:53] with presenting about Bitcoin with with
[00:54] doing something in Bitcoin uh and and
[00:57] what what your kind of point to what
[01:01] today yeah so I originally found Bitcoin
[01:04] in
[01:06] 2009 2009 or
[01:08] 2010 uh in the very beginning I came
[01:11] across it on a like an obscure Anarchist
[01:15] uh blog spot and it sounded really cool
[01:18] you know you know uncensorable money and
[01:21] uh and it was an interesting thing the
[01:23] te the technology side of it the cryptog
[01:26] uh you know cryptographic side of it I
[01:28] was kind of interesting
[01:30] and I I don't think I bought my first
[01:32] one for maybe a year or a year and a
[01:35] half but I was uh there there used to be
[01:37] this Bitcoin faucet um it was just a
[01:40] website where you could go click a
[01:41] button and get some free Bitcoin I think
[01:43] it was like two or three or something uh
[01:46] and I remember that and I even mined a
[01:48] little bit uh and so this was like you
[01:51] know on my laptop this was like 2009
[01:53] 2010
[01:55] 2011 uh and I didn't know anything about
[01:58] economics I didn't know anything about
[02:00] Finance um any of that kind of stuff it
[02:03] was just interesting to me and I thought
[02:05] it could be I thought it was cool you
[02:07] know uh and interesting so um yeah and
[02:10] then unfortunately I didn't really know
[02:12] what I was holding uh I didn't really
[02:15] understand the you know what Bitcoin
[02:18] really was um and ended up selling some
[02:23] uh you know I think it was 2013
[02:26] 2014 uh and then kind of throughout the
[02:28] 2010s I was just kind of in and out of
[02:31] it and this was before I jumped into
[02:34] like economics and macro and all that
[02:37] kind of stuff so I just had no idea what
[02:39] I was really holding
[02:41] unfortunately and uh you know kind of
[02:43] fast forward to
[02:45] 2020 um that was really when I started
[02:48] to dive into uh economics and finance
[02:52] and markets and um and and that was kind
[02:56] of when I finally started to realize
[02:59] what Bitcoin represented um on at least
[03:03] on the kind of uh economic side on the
[03:05] on the money side um but unfortunately
[03:08] you know I had sold all of them uh you
[03:11] know throughout the
[03:13] 2010s uh and so yeah you know had to
[03:16] basically start to kind of
[03:18] reaccumulate um and and try to build a
[03:21] stack at no nowhere near what I had uh
[03:24] unfortunately it's one of my biggest
[03:26] regrets uh in my life I think I I think
[03:30] at the at at the peak I had like 300 or
[03:34] 400 um and so it's a pretty huge regret
[03:38] uh but you know I didn't know what I
[03:39] didn't know and yeah since 2020 I've
[03:43] basically just been uh you know trying
[03:46] to learn as much as I can about um
[03:49] economics and markets and uh finance and
[03:53] and international trade and all this
[03:54] kind of stuff and uh and now you know
[03:58] now that I have done that
[04:00] uh I've never been more confident in in
[04:03] an investment or a trade um I've never
[04:06] been more confident in in in a trade
[04:09] than Bitcoin um than I am now so yeah my
[04:13] goal is to just try try to get back to a
[04:15] a small fraction of the stack that I
[04:17] used to
[04:18] have what does um before we start with
[04:21] the the slides and things but what does
[04:24] Bitcoin represent for you like you said
[04:28] before you you need need a long time to
[04:30] to get what what Bitcoin actually
[04:33] is yeah freedom I would say probably if
[04:37] I had a sum it up in one word um freedom
[04:40] but then you know the the separation of
[04:43] money and state you know a lot of people
[04:46] uh use that as a way to describe what
[04:49] Bitcoin actually does and I think that
[04:50] that's uh a super you know that that
[04:54] would be a really great summary of of
[04:56] what what makes Bitcoin so important um
[05:00] is that ability to separate money and
[05:02] state interesting um perfect then let's
[05:05] let's start directly in um I think the
[05:08] first thing uh as we discussed would be
[05:10] like what is the problem like why why
[05:12] why do we need Bitcoin in the first
[05:14] place uh is kind of the starting point
[05:17] uh what are we looking at in in in this
[05:19] chart is this the first one you want to
[05:21] show yeah this is the first one so
[05:25] um many people don't know this but uh
[05:28] and and and it's very rarely discussed
[05:31] in kind of mainstream uh mainstream
[05:33] media but the suicide rate is actually
[05:37] uh has has not been this High since the
[05:40] Great Depression um so this graph shows
[05:45] the suicide rate starting in the early
[05:47] 1900s um all the way through to today uh
[05:52] the chart cut off at 2022 uh so I had to
[05:55] to you know add a add a bar to represent
[05:58] um The Zo suicide rate as of 2023 2024
[06:03] but as you can see the last time the
[06:05] suicide rate was this High um was
[06:08] actually uh the Great Depression many
[06:11] people don't know this but it is just
[06:14] one of the many indicators of what I
[06:18] would uh describe as kind of economic
[06:22] malaise uh e you know hopelessness uh
[06:27] despair um and you know the more that
[06:30] I've learned about economics and finance
[06:32] and markets and all that kind of stuff
[06:34] more I've I I've dived into all that the
[06:37] more that you start to realize that kind
[06:38] of everything is Downstream from
[06:43] economics uh a and the money obviously
[06:46] being broken um and I think the suicide
[06:49] rate is is a very easy way to uh
[06:53] quantify just how hopeless are the
[06:57] people of a country um and the last time
[07:00] they were this hopeless was the end of
[07:03] the Great Depression um so of course you
[07:06] know we're not uh we're not in an we're
[07:09] not even in a recession uh technically
[07:13] um and we're certainly not in a an
[07:15] official depression um but something I
[07:19] would point out is that a depression
[07:21] many people think of a depression as uh
[07:24] you know negative 10% GDP you know GDP
[07:27] is Contracting at 10%
[07:30] uh you know every year it's the super
[07:33] sharp very um uh
[07:37] pronounced economic contraction but
[07:40] really uh what a depression really is is
[07:43] just a prolonged period of sub Trend or
[07:48] sub um um potential growth and so
[07:54] arguably uh you know depending on on the
[07:57] data that you're looking at uh there is
[07:59] an argument to be made that we've
[08:01] actually been living in a silent
[08:04] depression um since you know
[08:07] 2008 uh and there are some people that
[08:09] talk about this um Jeff Snyder is is one
[08:13] of them um and and and there is data to
[08:16] to indicate that um now it's not you
[08:19] know GDP has get been growing at you
[08:21] know two 2% a year uh and you know
[08:25] jobless claims are not you know through
[08:27] the roof but arguably if you if you kind
[08:30] of dig a couple layers deeper um into
[08:33] some of the data it does indicate that
[08:37] uh at least for the kind of
[08:39] bottom uh 70% of the country that they
[08:43] are living in a silent depression um and
[08:46] I think one one of the best ways uh to
[08:49] to quantify that is the suicide rate um
[08:53] and so so this is why I always talk
[08:55] about mention this particular statistic
[08:59] uh is that I think it's a good way to
[09:00] encapsulate just how hopeless uh people
[09:04] are about not just their current
[09:06] situation but their future
[09:09] situation um now this is drug overdose
[09:14] deaths um this is not per capita um you
[09:18] know per 100,000 people like the suicide
[09:22] rate uh graph was uh this is just kind
[09:25] of the nominals uh drug overdose deaths
[09:27] but I think this is another
[09:29] really good way to
[09:32] quantify uh you know just how hopeless
[09:35] people are um you know I if if you're
[09:38] extremely hopeful about the future um
[09:41] and you feel in a in a strong healthy
[09:44] economic position uh you know taking a
[09:48] uh you know 1% of the population that
[09:50] might have genetic predispositions out
[09:53] uh just kind of generally speaking you
[09:55] know people don't go out and use heroin
[09:58] uh if they're extremely hopeful about
[10:01] their their present situation and and
[10:03] their future um you know the
[10:05] possibilities for their future so so the
[10:08] the drug overdose death um I think is
[10:11] another really good way to quantify and
[10:15] see it in a graphical
[10:17] representation um uh just just how bad
[10:21] the situ the the situation is um and
[10:24] this chart shows uh the rate so this
[10:29] goes goes back to the first chart we
[10:30] were looking at where it shows it per
[10:33] 100,000
[10:35] people and um it includes alcohol rated
[10:38] drug related uh and then
[10:41] suicide and then deaths of Despair is
[10:44] basically all three of those combined um
[10:48] and you know we see a really obvious
[10:52] break of the trend uh you know the the
[10:56] deaths of Despair you know from the 1900
[10:59] s uh they they ticked up during the
[11:02] Great Depression um and the 20s but
[11:05] generally speaking from the 1900s to
[11:07] about 1960 they were trending down um
[11:12] and of course they started to ramp back
[11:14] up uh right around the you know
[11:17] 1970 uh you know uh gold was the the um
[11:21] gold standard was ended in
[11:23] 1971 uh and we see we see a kind of
[11:26] notable Trend change there um and then
[11:30] really after 2000 uh it just takes off
[11:34] and it just goes parabolic um and and
[11:38] this indicates that something is very
[11:40] deeply wrong uh at least the way I look
[11:43] at it this indicates that you know
[11:44] something is very deeply wrong with our
[11:47] our our society um our our economic
[11:51] system however you want to describe it
[11:54] something is deeply deeply wrong uh and
[11:56] deeply deeply broken um um and I would
[12:00] argue that it's two main issues uh the
[12:04] dollar and the reserve currency status
[12:07] of the dollar and the trade deficit um
[12:11] and they're both very tightly linked um
[12:16] and and we'll go into that a little bit
[12:18] more um but the money is simply broken
[12:22] of course Fe you know the fact that the
[12:24] dollar is a fiat currency I think is
[12:26] also uh deeply problematic um but but
[12:30] that that kind of Paints the picture of
[12:33] the problem you know there there is
[12:35] something very deeply wrong with our
[12:38] society uh and you know I'm not sure
[12:41] about Europe um I've only you know I
[12:43] live in America so I've only kind of
[12:45] looked at the American data um but I
[12:48] would venture to Guess that this General
[12:51] uh concept is is true uh in Europe as
[12:55] well uh and I I would even argue that in
[12:58] general
[12:59] it's worse in the whole world it's it's
[13:03] bad in the USA but it's even worse
[13:06] outside of the USA because the USA has
[13:09] the uh the the world Reserve currency so
[13:12] they can actually export uh inflation
[13:15] they they can export some of
[13:17] the devaluation of their own currency to
[13:20] other countries that use the the the
[13:23] currency maybe that's also where you're
[13:25] going with the trade
[13:27] deficit but it is is it is really
[13:30] interesting for me when you look
[13:31] obviously like there are things that are
[13:33] outside of of America maybe a little
[13:36] better in maybe worse I heard a lot of a
[13:40] lot about Americans complaining about
[13:43] their food supply the quality of food uh
[13:45] and a lot of people actually a lot of
[13:47] Americans also told me it's way better
[13:49] in Europe because like Europe is so
[13:51] strict with like what you can put on
[13:54] food and and using the pesticides and
[13:56] stuff like that uh so a lot of people
[14:00] actually are curious like or or noticing
[14:03] that some things are actually better in
[14:05] Europe but I would argue it's harder to
[14:09] find the things that are better in
[14:10] Europe than they in America so like the
[14:14] most of the things actually working
[14:15] better uh in America like Innovation
[14:18] like the the whole uh company and
[14:20] startup uh spirit is way better the the
[14:23] the risk appetite uh for for going for
[14:26] Big Ideas is a little bit B bigger and
[14:29] better uh and Europe is very we we
[14:32] trying to regulate everything down into
[14:35] the ground uh so that it's it's
[14:38] interesting to to make those
[14:40] comparisons yeah and you know I uh I'm I
[14:45] might come across as very critical of um
[14:48] America and and certainly the current
[14:51] system um but the re you know I think
[14:54] it's important to note I I am as I've
[14:57] gotten older I've gotten even more
[14:59] patriotic and and and you know I love
[15:02] America uh and there's certainly a lot
[15:05] of uh great uh aspects of America and of
[15:10] uh the system that I think we have the
[15:12] potential to build um Americans are
[15:15] great people and you know this the
[15:18] reason that I criticize uh some of this
[15:22] you know get get so into some of the
[15:25] stuff uh and and be so critical is
[15:28] because I love my country um and and I
[15:32] want to see uh you know I don't want to
[15:35] see uh deaths of dispair of my
[15:38] countrymen uh looking like a hockey
[15:40] stick you know going parabolic um I
[15:43] don't want young people to be so
[15:45] incredibly hopeless that they are
[15:48] gambling uh on Meme coins trying to
[15:52] catch a
[15:54] 3000x return because that's the only way
[15:56] they'll be able to afford a house you
[15:58] know and and it's important to mention
[16:00] like with with that data that we just
[16:02] looked at um they the it it the the
[16:07] suicides and um uh drug overdose deaths
[16:12] you know this mainly applies to to men
[16:15] um and young men are are you know what
[16:19] just I I I think one of the Forgotten um
[16:24] uh you know groups of people is we've
[16:26] forgotten our young men um and I think
[16:29] you know being a a younger man you know
[16:32] I I I think it's important to point this
[16:34] out because um you know not I didn't uh
[16:37] I wasn't able to find a graph of it but
[16:40] um you know this goes into like
[16:42] prescription uh anti-depressant
[16:45] prescriptions too um we've seen that you
[16:48] know the chart looks very Sim if you
[16:50] were to chart it out it would look very
[16:52] similar to to this particular
[16:55] chart um I think if memory serves me
[16:58] correct
[16:59] uh since 1970 anti-depressant uh
[17:02] prescriptions have uh increased by
[17:05] 13x um and so you know there I I I only
[17:10] say all this stuff because I do care uh
[17:14] about my country and I and I do want it
[17:16] to be better and I do believe that there
[17:19] is a way to fix all of this um you know
[17:22] I I I just hope uh that you know because
[17:25] sometimes when you're really critical of
[17:27] a of a particular country or a
[17:29] particular area or a particular form of
[17:32] government people kind of start to
[17:34] pigeonhole you and I am not you know
[17:38] some some deranged you know uh communist
[17:43] uh you know capitalism hater kind of
[17:46] kind of thing it's not that you know the
[17:48] only reason that I bring the criticisms
[17:50] that I do is because I love my country
[17:53] and because I believe uh that we have
[17:55] the potential for so much better uh if
[17:57] that makes sense
[17:59] that makes absolutely sense and also it
[18:02] it shows very much especially when you
[18:04] look at all those charts from 971 and
[18:07] there's like this uh uh
[18:10] wdf uh happened in 1971 website where it
[18:14] all kind of also collected it's really
[18:16] great to see what money does and like
[18:20] yeah solving the money problem actually
[18:23] solves most of the world's problems
[18:26] because it solves incentives and it
[18:28] gives the right structure to it it's not
[18:31] that if you fix money you all of the
[18:33] sudden fix depression but with a sound
[18:37] money you give the right incentive and
[18:40] the right uh framework to actually have
[18:43] less depressions because people can
[18:44] actually build something for themselves
[18:47] and they have sense and they have hope
[18:50] in in in their life so that's the that's
[18:53] where the famous saying like fix the
[18:54] money fix the world comes from I feel
[18:56] like yeah I and I agree completely Ely
[18:59] the the more that I've learned you know
[19:01] and the more that I've nerded out on
[19:03] macro and all this stuff the more that
[19:05] you you realize that is actually in fact
[19:09] um you know the foundation on which you
[19:12] know all these other second and third
[19:15] order effects that we see uh manifesting
[19:18] really at the end of the day it all
[19:19] boils down to the money and the economic
[19:22] system um and so this um this kind of
[19:26] goes into the uh
[19:29] globalization the trade deficit um so
[19:33] you know after after World War II we
[19:35] were um rebuilding Europe um we were
[19:40] largely unscathed our industrial
[19:42] capacity at least was largely unscathed
[19:45] by World War II um you know especially
[19:49] relative to Europe's and the rest of the
[19:51] world um and so we were able to
[19:53] basically rebuild the world following
[19:56] World War II um in America was EXT in a
[20:00] very very strong position um it had
[20:03] accumulated quite a lot of debt during
[20:05] World War II uh and and you know I
[20:08] always point out that negative real
[20:10] rates on Treasury bonds following World
[20:13] War II uh every year um were about
[20:18] negative 15% so if you bought those war
[20:21] bonds um Financial repression they got
[20:24] you at about 15 negative 15% a year
[20:29] um but you know we we stuck through that
[20:32] Financial repression and uh you know
[20:35] we're able to to come out of it uh in a
[20:38] vastly stronger position uh especially
[20:41] you know after we had kind of
[20:43] deleveraged uh the debt that had
[20:45] accumulated during that period um and
[20:48] you know it was around the kind of start
[20:51] the mid-50s where everyone started to
[20:54] want
[20:55] dollars um and this this you know goes
[20:59] on for many uh you know many years uh
[21:02] into the 60s and 70s and and basically
[21:07] you know we're going around the world
[21:09] and propagating the dollar um of course
[21:12] there was demand for dollars uh but you
[21:15] know we we also encourage the adoption
[21:18] of the US dollar um and this is this is
[21:23] what the euro dollar system represents
[21:26] um and so under un fortunately uh as as
[21:31] a as a consequence of some of this um we
[21:35] started running trade deficits uh and so
[21:39] so it's important just to Define what
[21:41] that is uh the the tra the balance of
[21:44] trade um or the trade deficit is simply
[21:48] the value of the Imports of a country uh
[21:52] versus the value of the exports of a
[21:55] country um and so you know we we went
[21:59] from having a trade surplus meaning we
[22:02] consumed uh less than we produced um and
[22:07] so we were a net producer uh and this
[22:10] principle hopefully makes sense to
[22:11] bitcoiners you can't accumulate Bitcoin
[22:14] unless you are a net producer for a
[22:17] value for the world it's very similar to
[22:20] to the to the trade deficit um you can't
[22:23] run a trade surplus if you are a net
[22:26] consumer or a net de um and so what we
[22:31] see here is the dotted Red Line
[22:33] indicates a perfectly balanced uh trade
[22:37] where uh the US is importing just as
[22:40] much as it's exporting um and what we
[22:43] see is that um here me see if that's
[22:47] better um uh here in in the 80s uh
[22:51] following the the end of the gold
[22:53] standard uh the trade deficit W starts
[22:56] to widen uh quite quite dramatically um
[23:01] and and and what that meant was that the
[23:03] US was consuming far more than they were
[23:07] producing um and of course you know
[23:09] throughout time uh this gets worse and
[23:13] worse and worse um and we see that uh
[23:17] you know in the 90s uh globalization
[23:20] really took off right and the trade
[23:22] deficit narrow uh widened uh
[23:26] significantly um and you know you fast
[23:29] forward to today uh and this chart is
[23:31] actually not updated with the current
[23:33] data the bounce of trade just came out
[23:36] um a week or two ago and it's at a new
[23:39] record um so you see that lowest point
[23:42] on the purple line uh and our current
[23:45] trade deficit is actually lower than
[23:48] that even um and so what that means is
[23:51] that you know we we what we've been
[23:53] doing is we've been you know Outsourcing
[23:56] all of our good paying jobs
[23:59] um in
[24:00] manufacturing all those jobs that built
[24:02] America and rebuilt the world um we've
[24:05] been gradually Outsourcing those jobs to
[24:08] cheaper uh countries where where the
[24:10] cost of production is cheaper cost of
[24:12] Labor is cheaper um in in the Emerging
[24:15] Markets like uh China Malaysia um you
[24:20] know Southeast Asian countries like that
[24:23] um and and that's great for some people
[24:26] um and we'll kind of touch on that in in
[24:28] the next chart um but but just broadly
[24:32] speaking when you are importing far more
[24:35] than you are exporting right you you are
[24:37] consuming far more than you are
[24:39] producing uh well how do you how do you
[24:43] come up with the that difference well
[24:46] one of the ways you finance a trade
[24:49] deficit is with a fiscal deficit and now
[24:51] this is the deficit that most people
[24:53] have probably heard about um this
[24:56] represents a government income versus
[24:59] their spending uh and we all know kind
[25:02] of that the US is currently running a
[25:05] pretty insane uh close to 7% of GDP
[25:09] deficit uh which normally you we have
[25:11] only seen during you know world war or a
[25:15] really really steep recession um and and
[25:18] of course we're not in either of those
[25:21] um and and yet we're running pretty
[25:23] historic uh fiscal deficit now one of
[25:27] the things you won't hear discussed in
[25:30] the mainstream media is why we are
[25:32] running that historic uh fiscal deficit
[25:35] well we have to be able to finance uh
[25:38] this trade deficit right we have to come
[25:40] up because we are our American uh
[25:44] companies are getting far less income
[25:46] from the rest of the world than than we
[25:48] are uh uh spending on on Goods uh from
[25:53] the rest of the world because of that um
[25:56] you know we have to come up with that
[25:57] difference somehow and one of the ways
[26:00] that we do is via the fiscal deficit um
[26:03] and so you know you can see in this
[26:05] chart the the correlation at least uh
[26:08] it's not perfect Ono one fit um but
[26:11] there is a a very strong correlation
[26:13] between uh the fiscal deficit and and
[26:16] the balance of
[26:17] trade that's super interesting uh to to
[26:20] to look at and and it and it makes it so
[26:25] hard to ignore once you see see the Juds
[26:28] what's that corporate profits now yeah
[26:31] so I I mentioned this system of
[26:33] globalism is really great for some
[26:35] people um and one of the people you know
[26:38] one of the groups of people that it's
[26:39] really good for is multinational
[26:41] corporations um they get to you know
[26:45] Outsource to to countries with much
[26:47] cheaper labor costs um and so it's very
[26:51] good for their profits and their profit
[26:53] margins um and so here we see the trade
[26:56] balance inverted
[26:58] um so so as that purple line is going up
[27:02] the trade deficit is getting worse um
[27:06] wider and then we see in white corporate
[27:09] profits um and and I the the chart was
[27:13] so the correlation was so striking that
[27:16] I threw a a correlation coefficient on
[27:20] uh to to indicate just how strong the
[27:22] correlation is um and you can see that
[27:25] in red at the bottom uh and it is you
[27:28] know following you know kind of in the
[27:30] in the uh mid-2010s this correlation is
[27:34] extremely strong um and of course it it
[27:38] it uh the correlation gets less uh
[27:41] notable during
[27:43] recessions um but generally speaking you
[27:46] know this this trade balance uh you know
[27:49] the worse our trade deficit gets the
[27:52] better our corporate you know the the
[27:55] biggest of the big corporations uh the
[27:58] multinational corporations the better
[28:00] they do um and so that kind of leads
[28:04] into the next one and so now uh we look
[28:08] at the S&P and the trade balance uh the
[28:11] S&P here is in Orange um and the trade
[28:14] balance again inverted uh is in
[28:17] purple um and now we start to to to look
[28:20] at okay well if it's really great for
[28:22] these multinational corporations uh that
[28:25] that you know globalization has allowed
[28:27] for much uh higher profit margins due to
[28:31] much lower labor costs cost of
[28:33] production um how how good is is the
[28:38] system for the average American um so
[28:42] here what I did was throw us wages as a
[28:45] share of GDP um and what this shows is
[28:48] the average hourly wage divided by GDP
[28:52] um and so GDP is the denominator and
[28:55] what this indicates when you I I do a
[28:58] lot of these kind of relative charts
[29:00] because I think that uh they're very
[29:03] helpful in illustrating a trend um a
[29:06] relative Trend between two things so uh
[29:09] to put it very simply if if the average
[29:11] hourly wage of you know the average
[29:14] American uh the average amount that they
[29:16] make per hour if that is growing at the
[29:20] same rate as GDP this line would just go
[29:23] straight it'd be horizontal perfectly
[29:25] straight um horizontal but instead what
[29:28] we see is you know since
[29:32] 1970 um wages have the average hourly
[29:36] wage uh has actually trailed GDP um and
[29:42] so so you know the US wage as a share of
[29:46] GDP the average Americans wage are not
[29:49] keeping up anywhere close to GDP growth
[29:53] we like to talk about GDP you know oh
[29:56] another year and you know three and a
[29:57] half half perc GDP growth well what this
[30:00] indicates is that Americans wages have
[30:02] not even been keeping up with that um in
[30:05] fact they've been growing slower than
[30:08] GDP has been growing um and and then you
[30:12] you contrast that with uh you know the
[30:15] S&P 500 um and and the you know overlay
[30:19] the balance of of trade and you see it's
[30:22] been really good for the S&P 500
[30:25] multinational corporations you know
[30:28] anyone who holds S&P 500 um but of
[30:31] course one of the things we know is that
[30:33] wealth inequality actually and this is
[30:35] also never mentioned but wealth
[30:38] inequality today is even worse than it
[30:40] was in the Gilded Age of America so we
[30:44] named an entire you know uh uh decade uh
[30:49] era of time after uh you know because of
[30:53] the the historic wealth inequality of
[30:54] that time and and wealth inequality
[30:57] today is even worse than that um and we
[31:00] know that you know the top 10 top 1%
[31:04] basically own all the assets uh so you
[31:08] know it some people might think oh well
[31:11] you know everyone can buy the S&P 500 uh
[31:14] I have a chart for that later but um but
[31:17] what this indicates is basically you
[31:19] know the disparity between those who
[31:21] work for a living uh and and their wage
[31:25] growth versus those who invest for a
[31:28] living uh and this is an interesting
[31:30] concept of of this balance between
[31:33] capital and labor um and of course you
[31:36] know a lot of people would think oh
[31:37] America's capitalist so we prioritize
[31:40] Capital which is accurate um but I you
[31:44] know I would argue that it's not always
[31:45] been that way even in America um and and
[31:49] and I think we might be starting to see
[31:52] a a kind of secular Trend change uh
[31:55] towards uh more of a populist Pro Labor
[31:59] uh sort of uh World um but clearly uh
[32:03] Capital has been uh you know uh very
[32:07] prioritized over Labor uh and I think
[32:10] that's that's one way to kind of
[32:11] summarize this chart I partnered up with
[32:15] coin vigilante this is the most
[32:17] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:20] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:23] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:26] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:29] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:32] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:34] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:38] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:41] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:44] watch collections you have the date of
[32:47] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:50] there and of course also the block
[32:52] height and which EPO we are currently in
[32:56] I love the level of te detail they put
[32:58] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:01] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:04] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:06] love those watches so so much if you
[33:10] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[33:12] regular basis I'll guess you already
[33:14] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[33:17] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[33:20] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:22] personal recommendation for Hardware
[33:24] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[33:27] it's simple to set up it's also perfect

[34:03] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[34:05] in case something goes really really

[34:21] how you can level up your sovereignty
[34:24] that's a it's a it's a it's a frust
[34:27] rating thing once you realize that
[34:30] of most
[34:32] people would make more money thinking
[34:35] about what they should do with their
[34:37] resourced Capital rather than working
[34:40] one hour like like thinking about like
[34:43] okay where should I put my financial
[34:44] energy and what should I do with that
[34:46] Financial energy uh and how do I
[34:50] allocate that Capital most efficiently
[34:54] this gives especially the the wealthy
[34:57] class
[34:58] um so much more than they could ever do
[35:01] in one hour of work and that's that's a
[35:05] flawed system in my opinion uh that
[35:09] that's a system that incentivizes
[35:11] sitting on a big stack of capital versus
[35:15] working towards a better Society a
[35:18] better Humanity working towards bigger
[35:20] things and so I I do um I I am a big fan
[35:26] of proof of work and what proof of work
[35:29] will do for Humanity and and thank you
[35:32] so much for for laying it out so so
[35:34] amazingly with with with the charts I
[35:36] think it it makes perfect sense and I
[35:38] think it's really clear now for for for
[35:41] people yeah I totally agree um and you
[35:44] know you can look at even something you
[35:46] know uh like taxes right uh so so if you
[35:50] work for a living uh you know what's the
[35:53] tax rate uh for for the average worker
[35:56] you know on a on a getting a salary on a
[35:58] W2 versus what is the tax rate if you
[36:02] are someone like you mentioned you know
[36:04] a wealthy investor that just sits on
[36:07] piles of financial assets uh and and of
[36:11] course um the capital gains tax is like
[36:13] half of what uh you know the the the
[36:18] income tax rate is for people that work
[36:20] for a living so so that's you know I
[36:22] think another easy way to get an
[36:25] indication for for which uh uh you know
[36:28] which of those two groups is being
[36:30] prioritized by government uh or you know
[36:33] by an economic system um and and and
[36:36] this goes into specifically the total
[36:39] net worth of the top
[36:41] 1% um as a share of
[36:44] GDP and the average hourly wage as a
[36:47] share of GDP so they both use GDP as the
[36:51] denominator so so the red line and the
[36:53] purple line that which we had seen in
[36:55] the chart before this purple line and
[36:58] this red line have the same denominator
[37:01] uh the only difference is that the
[37:03] numerator is different uh the average
[37:05] hourly wage is the numerator for the
[37:07] purple line and we know that that's been
[37:10] declining relentlessly for decades uh
[37:13] but now we look at the the total net
[37:16] worth of the top
[37:17] 1% um as the numerator for the red line
[37:22] and what we see is the trend is the
[37:25] exact opposite um unfortun fortunately
[37:27] trading view didn't have data uh before
[37:30] 1990 for for this uh but but we can see
[37:34] since 1990 and I I would argue
[37:37] globalization really kind of accelerated
[37:39] in the 90s um you can see that the top
[37:43] you know the the total net worth of the
[37:45] top 1% divided by GDP that line is going
[37:49] straight up into the right and so what
[37:51] that indicates is that the total net
[37:53] worth of the top 1% is growing fast
[37:58] than GDP right so so the top 1% are
[38:01] outperforming GDP and and the average
[38:05] hourly wage is under performing GDP so
[38:08] if you just you know figure 3% GDP
[38:12] growth well the average person's wages
[38:14] are only growing maybe 1% uh and then
[38:18] the total net worth you know might be
[38:20] growing five six
[38:21] 7% um and so so that's basically what
[38:24] these relative charts uh can show you
[38:28] and I think they're really instructive
[38:30] for some of these things uh changing the
[38:34] denominator uh I I always say you know
[38:37] the denominator the US dollar is
[38:39] fundamentally broken um and you know
[38:44] this I think uh denominating things in
[38:48] other metrics uh can be extremely
[38:52] illustrative of um some of these
[38:55] Concepts uh for example if you divide
[38:57] the S&P 500 by gold or by M2 money
[39:01] supply or by the FED balance sheet it
[39:04] doesn't look nearly as good as the kind
[39:07] of nominal chart that most people see uh
[39:10] so I think it's it it's something you
[39:12] know if people play around with trading
[39:14] view or or Fred uh you know and they're
[39:17] interested in this stuff you know I
[39:19] would encourage people to try out these
[39:21] kind of relative charts um because they
[39:24] can illustrate some really striking
[39:26] trends uh like this one and it and it
[39:29] shows too that the top net uh top 1%
[39:33] their net worth is extremely correlated
[39:35] to the trade deficit and you know that
[39:38] lines up with the corporate profits that
[39:40] we were looking at earlier and the S&P
[39:42] 500 um we both saw a strong correlation
[39:46] with with the trade deficit for those uh
[39:49] and you see it again here um where you
[39:52] know the the the out the level of
[39:54] outperformance that the top 1% are are
[39:58] performing uh the level that they're
[40:00] outperforming
[40:01] GDP uh very you know increases as the
[40:05] trade deficit gets worse uh hopefully
[40:08] that makes
[40:09] sense and it's a really great point
[40:12] because I have so many people that adust
[40:15] in ETFs and stocks and they're like oh
[40:18] like I I 5% per year I make 10% per year
[40:22] I make 7% per year and and I'm and they
[40:26] feel smart they they feel like they're
[40:29] growing they feel like they are
[40:33] outperforming and once I set them down
[40:36] and say like okay like what is the
[40:38] actual inflation rate let's go through
[40:40] it like what do you want in life do you
[40:42] want a nice house one day do you want to
[40:44] eat in a in a good restaurant one day do
[40:47] you want to take your kids out to to
[40:49] those trips and and have those
[40:50] experience and then they've soon
[40:53] realized that their a real inflation
[40:56] rate
[40:57] isn't 5% or 4% or 7% or even 10% if you
[41:03] go out and and and see what is the
[41:05] inflation rate of um a great house at
[41:09] the lake what is it the inflation rate
[41:11] of uh eating at great
[41:14] restaurants uh not McDonald's but great
[41:17] restaurants so like that inflation rate
[41:20] is all of the sudden way higher and
[41:22] we're looking at like 15 20 maybe even
[41:25] 30% um
[41:27] obviously if you just live in your mom's
[41:30] basement and watch Netflix all day long
[41:33] you don't worry about
[41:35] inflation but but that's not the not
[41:38] that's not the life I want to live
[41:40] so when you realize that you actually
[41:44] like okay I invest in something where I
[41:46] make 5% more but actually um the
[41:50] inflation rate is for me is 30% so I
[41:54] have to find something that makes 30% to
[41:56] keep up with inflation to preserve my
[42:00] financial energy and my salary also has
[42:03] to keep up
[42:05] 30% uh every year to keep up with uh
[42:10] what I currently have and then I also
[42:12] want to uh get better in in my life so
[42:16] it's it's a mind shift that people have
[42:18] to do of
[42:19] like are you really getting richer if
[42:22] you invest in an ETF that gives you 7% a
[42:25] year no yeah
[42:28] exact exactly the hurdle rate is so much
[42:31] higher than people realize you know I'm
[42:33] a big fan of Jeff Booth and and he talks
[42:36] about the kind of deflationary forces of
[42:40] Technology right so so it's not that Z
[42:43] zero% is our our our Baseline it's
[42:46] actually we should be seeing deflation
[42:49] on the order of four five% per year due
[42:52] to technological uh advancements and
[42:55] then you add on uh in you know that the
[42:59] actual Consumer Price inflation to that
[43:01] Baseline to the Baseline of four
[43:03] negative four or 5% um and it's very
[43:06] similar to the to to the growth the the
[43:09] compounded annual growth rate of the
[43:11] money supply which is around 8% um and
[43:15] so the hurdle rate for people is
[43:16] actually much higher than they realize
[43:19] um and of course Bitcoin is one of the
[43:20] only assets that has
[43:22] outperformed um the hurdle rate uh you
[43:25] know even you know you you can use any
[43:29] denominator you want on bitcoin and it
[43:32] has outperformed um and you know I'd
[43:35] point out I'm a younger Millennial you
[43:37] know and I've worked my my butt off for
[43:39] 15 16 years in this in you know the
[43:43] particular industry I work in um and you
[43:46] know I'm looking around and you know i'
[43:48] point out a couple years ago I kind of
[43:50] finally got to uh you know good salary
[43:53] and and and I I'm a director uh at this
[43:56] company and I thought okay you know I've
[43:58] done it I've made it um and this was in
[44:02] 2020 and then Co came right and they
[44:04] printed all this money asset inflation
[44:07] went through the roof and I went I I
[44:10] started looking around and going you
[44:11] know what is going on and that's really
[44:14] what led me into markets uh economics
[44:16] and and and finance and all this was
[44:19] like you know I I went one day being
[44:21] able to afford you know a modest little
[44:23] house in a suburb of LA to now wait I
[44:28] have to Triple my
[44:29] salary and I just I couldn't understand
[44:33] what was happening to me um you know
[44:36] because I I make a pretty good salary
[44:38] right I'm a director uh there's not
[44:40] really much higher I can go uh and yet I
[44:44] have to Triple my salary to qualify for
[44:47] a mortgage on a 60 70 year old house
[44:50] with you know two bedroom two bath small
[44:53] little thing like H what happened there
[44:56] um and so so that was really kind of
[44:58] what led me into looking into all this
[45:01] stuff was you know I think a lot of
[45:02] people have felt what you just described
[45:05] uh that phenomenon and I think a lot of
[45:08] people are are hungry for answers I
[45:11] think a lot of people are um want to
[45:15] understand uh and you know they they
[45:18] might not want want to know as badly as
[45:21] I did you know I have probably devoted
[45:23] 20 30,000 hours um maybe even more
[45:27] honestly to to to this world um of
[45:31] macroeconomics and and markets but you
[45:34] know most people they don't want to find
[45:35] out that badly so what I try to do is is
[45:39] you know uh distill everything down to
[45:43] to a bite-sized chunk um where people
[45:46] can understand because you know some of
[45:48] the stuff is complicated um and so my
[45:51] goal is always to help the average
[45:53] person you know because the average
[45:54] person is hurting the people I know in
[45:56] real life
[45:57] um are hurting badly um and and I think
[46:02] you know that the first step is
[46:05] understanding what the problem is um and
[46:07] once you understand what the problem is
[46:09] the solution especially now that we have
[46:11] Bitcoin uh is is so
[46:16] straightforward yeah it's it's it's
[46:19] so it's so messed up
[46:21] honestly you you have to now in that
[46:25] world be an investor macroeconomics you
[46:28] you have to do all those things and
[46:30] maybe you just want to be a doctor and
[46:33] save lives maybe you just want to be um
[46:37] creating an app maybe you just W
[46:39] to uh do a YouTube
[46:42] channel that then it then it that it
[46:45] itself is already a lot of work so like
[46:48] you you don't want to be uh Financial
[46:51] portfolio manager on the side and
[46:54] analyzing charts and looking at all
[46:56] those things
[46:57] in a perfect world my channel would be
[47:01] irrelevant like like all the things that
[47:04] we are talking about in a perfect world
[47:07] nobody would have talk about that it
[47:10] shouldn't we we we shouldn't had to do
[47:13] those educational things because we just
[47:15] have Bitcoin and and we just have good
[47:18] money and we can focus on providing
[47:21] value for other people I I I I put out
[47:24] something like one or two days ago on
[47:25] Twitter and I'm arguing with people
[47:27] around trading and I'm saying trading is
[47:30] not good you might make some money with
[47:33] it but you're not adding any value so
[47:35] think about things where you can add
[47:39] value to society and to humanity and not
[47:42] where you can make money and I think if
[47:45] it's more philosophical thing now but
[47:47] like uh the the this figure out where
[47:51] you save your financial energy and
[47:53] Bitcoin is so obvious uh once you
[47:56] understand it and then just figure out
[47:58] where you can add value and I realized
[48:02] currently right now I can actually add
[48:06] the most value to humanity I think of
[48:09] like making people understand why they
[48:12] should be in Bitcoin in first place but
[48:15] Bitcoin should not we we we shouldn't
[48:17] talk about Bitcoin all day long I do
[48:19] that now but because it's necessary but
[48:22] it's actually not good I think it would
[48:24] be better if I have a podcast on like
[48:26] how to like do AI stuff or like like
[48:30] what what 100 other things that you
[48:32] couldn't talk about it's really hard
[48:34] because it do so much Bitcoin is like
[48:35] almost nothing else in my life now but
[48:37] like that's where we actually should
[48:40] go yeah yeah no I agree um this uh this
[48:44] next chart you know kind of shows what
[48:47] we what we were talking about that
[48:48] hurdle rate uh and just how badly um you
[48:52] know the average worker in America has
[48:54] been performing uh this chart actually
[48:57] goes back further this chart goes back
[48:59] before the end of the gold standard um
[49:02] and you can see uh you know versus gold
[49:05] uh versus M2 money supply and versus GDP
[49:08] we've already kind of seen that General
[49:10] trend line um but you know versus gold
[49:14] uh of course Bitcoin wasn't around in
[49:16] the 70s so it's the best kind of proxy
[49:19] uh to look at you know in real terms uh
[49:23] look at that that precipitous drop uh
[49:26] for the average worker um in Gold
[49:29] terms uh at in the early to mid 70s uh
[49:33] it's striking um and and so this just is
[49:36] kind of another way to uh to illustrate
[49:39] some of the the concepts we were talking
[49:41] about before um but what I would say is
[49:44] you know what's what's happened um is
[49:48] that we have a hyperf financialized
[49:52] economy as a direct result of being the
[49:55] reserve currency
[49:57] um and uh you know globalization and and
[50:00] and kind of the US running this huge
[50:02] trade deficit um basically the way that
[50:06] system works you know we uh uh don't
[50:10] make anything so we need to buy it from
[50:12] China well we don't generate enough
[50:14] income within our country to to pay for
[50:17] all that stuff so how do we come up with
[50:20] the dollars to send to China we put our
[50:22] youth uh into kind of inex in in
[50:26] escapable insurmountable debt via the
[50:29] fiscal deficit right and and and just
[50:31] gross federal debt that's one way that
[50:34] we raise cash get those dollars ship
[50:37] them out to China so that China can send
[50:40] us you know uh the stuff they make and
[50:43] China then takes a good amount of that
[50:46] money um it depends on the the era and
[50:49] it depends on a bunch of economic
[50:51] variables but in general you can kind of
[50:54] think of it as about 5050 about half of
[50:57] those dollars that we send to China um
[51:00] this is a very rough kind of rule thumb
[51:03] um but about half of them China stores
[51:05] as foreign exchange reserves uh and then
[51:08] the other half get recycled into US
[51:11] dollar assets um and so what what the
[51:16] Dollar's Reserve currency status has
[51:18] really done um is it's turned the dollar
[51:22] into a into a funding currency right the
[51:26] the if you are a
[51:29] foreigner a and dollar denominated uh
[51:32] assets they not only perform very well
[51:35] you know just in in US dollar terms but
[51:37] remember most current what like you
[51:39] mentioned in the very beginning most
[51:41] currencies have been falling or or
[51:43] weakening versus the dollar for decades
[51:46] um so not only are you getting that uh
[51:49] appreciation in dollar terms but you
[51:52] know versus your local currency um any
[51:56] dollar denominated assets you hold are
[51:58] going up even further um and so I think
[52:02] I think that that concept is super
[52:04] important because you know as the trade
[52:07] deficit gets worse what what is
[52:09] happening is that even more money is
[52:12] flowing
[52:13] into uh our Capital markets and so this
[52:17] is part of why we see such historic um
[52:21] overvaluation and in financial assets
[52:24] and and historic wealth inequality is
[52:27] just the structure of the system um if
[52:30] the current you know the current account
[52:31] of a of a country must must bounce like
[52:35] you if you are running a a a very large
[52:37] trade deficit that means that uh it is
[52:40] balanced by an equal amount you know say
[52:43] you're running a trillion dollar trade
[52:45] deficit um what that means just just on
[52:48] a very simple accounting basis is that a
[52:51] trillion dollars of of capital is
[52:53] flowing into your uh capital and Fin
[52:56] ancial account and um you know this is
[53:00] kind of very rarely talked about you
[53:03] won't hear this discussed certainly in
[53:06] the mainstream media um Mike Green talks
[53:09] about it sometimes I know he's not uh
[53:12] the the you know a fan of Bitcoin but I
[53:14] think uh he you know it's important to
[53:17] listen to to to people like this um and
[53:21] and take take things on a you know uh um
[53:25] per issue you know go go issue by issue
[53:28] uh and be objective you know and hear
[53:30] people out because Mike Green I think
[53:31] does have a lot of really interesting uh
[53:34] things to say and of course Luke groman
[53:36] talks about this um but but basically
[53:39] what what has happened is as our trade
[53:41] deficit has gotten worse what that means
[53:44] is that the uh the amount of money
[53:46] flowing into our capital and financial
[53:48] account from the rest of the world has
[53:51] gotten greater um and so that's why uh
[53:56] assets have this kind of second leg um
[54:00] is as the trade deficit has really blown
[54:02] out in the past two decades um that's
[54:05] why assets have gone uh so vertical is
[54:09] it's just a
[54:11] mechanical uh design of the system of
[54:14] being the reserve currency issuer
[54:16] everyone wants dollar denominated assets
[54:20] um if you're because you're you're
[54:22] earning uh not just you know the say the
[54:25] S&P 500 uh of course S&P 500 you know
[54:28] goes up most years uh so that's great
[54:31] you're you're making money there and
[54:32] then you're also making money uh in that
[54:35] in that asset because the dollar is
[54:38] appreciating versus your local currency
[54:40] so you're making even more money um and
[54:43] and and this is what's led to the
[54:45] historic wealth inequality um that we
[54:48] see today uh and I thought you know this
[54:51] this is a kind of interesting way to
[54:53] look at it the average hourly wage
[54:55] divided by G GP versus the S&P 500
[54:58] divided by GDP um so same denominator
[55:02] constant constant denominator uh and we
[55:05] see that the S&P 500 has grossly
[55:07] outperformed GDP um of course following
[55:11] 2000 uh you know the.com bubble and then
[55:14] again uh in 2008 there was that period
[55:16] where it uh fell pretty sharply the S&P
[55:20] 500 uh underperformed GDP but zooming
[55:24] way out since 1970 the S&P 500 has
[55:28] vastly outperformed GDP meanwhile the
[55:32] average worker the average American the
[55:35] 99% um their wages have vastly
[55:39] underperformed GDP um and I think this
[55:43] you know you could overlay the wealth
[55:44] inequality chart that a lot of people uh
[55:47] you know the the the jaw uh the jaw
[55:50] chart and you can see it happen um you
[55:53] know th this is what is causing that and
[55:56] and the trade deficit and the dollars
[55:58] Reserve currency status uh just due to
[56:00] Mechanical structural nature of the
[56:02] system uh that's what's causing
[56:05] this um this is
[56:07] a sorry I just want to add one small
[56:10] thing it's it's so frustrating then when
[56:12] central banks and especially the ECB
[56:15] come along and say like oh like Bitcoin
[56:18] is causing wealth inequality it's it's
[56:21] so frustrating when they make those
[56:22] arguments and then like uh real people
[56:25] actually repeat those without knowing
[56:28] better it's it's a frustrating thing
[56:30] because like the central banks are the
[56:33] ones that causing that and it's it's so
[56:35] clear when you presented it with those
[56:37] charts and Bitcoin is uh not the cause
[56:39] but the solution to the cause of the
[56:41] central
[56:42] banks yeah I I I actually read that ECB
[56:45] paper and I couldn't disagree more with
[56:48] them um of course there are winners and
[56:51] losers in any economic system um but but
[56:56] it's it's it's a reflection of the
[56:58] system way more so than it is a
[57:02] reflection of Bitcoin Bitcoin is just a
[57:04] neutral uh scarce asset right Bitcoin
[57:08] doesn't have a board of directors or
[57:10] president uh or political opinions
[57:13] Bitcoin is just a protocol um and so
[57:15] really you know what if if you know
[57:18] Bitcoin goes well I I would say when
[57:21] Bitcoin goes to two three five1 million
[57:24] per Bitcoin um you know there will
[57:26] certainly be winners uh but um that does
[57:31] that's not a reflection of Bitcoin
[57:33] that's a reflection of the underlying
[57:35] system uh and and the inflation in that
[57:38] system um to deal with the debt uh which
[57:41] kind of a whole other thing I've done a
[57:43] lot of work on the fiscal uh uh you know
[57:45] the debt and deficit um and financial
[57:49] repression and the debt um but but for
[57:52] the purposes of of uh this discussion I
[57:55] think it's very
[57:56] because uh you know I've been talking
[57:58] about uh trin's dilemma with and
[58:01] globalization the Dollar's Reserve
[58:03] currency status and and the actual
[58:05] second and third order effects I it's
[58:07] been you know as uh July of 2024 was
[58:11] really when I kind of saw you know
[58:14] realized what was going on and um
[58:16] thought you know oh my God I have to I
[58:19] have to screen this from the
[58:20] rooftops um but you know in the
[58:22] mainstream you're starting to hear a lot
[58:24] a lot of the stuff talked about out uh
[58:27] you know recently and it's encouraging
[58:29] for me you know means I was on the right
[58:31] track but but you know you're hearing
[58:33] the the term triffin dilemma much more
[58:36] nowadays and uh you know the a global
[58:39] monetary reordering like a Mara Lago
[58:42] Accord is kind of the the name people
[58:44] used to describe that um you're hearing
[58:47] that a lot recently these days and I
[58:49] think that Bitcoin uh
[58:52] plays probably will play an important
[58:54] role in that um this this is uh just
[58:58] another way to kind of look at um the
[59:01] the concept we we were talking about
[59:03] before um you divide the S&P 500 by the
[59:07] average hourly wage um and what what
[59:10] that shows you is how many hours at the
[59:12] average job would the average person
[59:15] need to work to buy one share of the S&P
[59:17] 500 and you could see here in the in the
[59:20] 70s you know it was like 15
[59:23] 20 uh that number now is 19 5 so the
[59:27] stock market has grown
[59:29] 650 faster than the average hourly wage
[59:33] since 1971 that is amazing I mean that's
[59:36] not amazing but it's it's it's amazingly
[59:40] sad yeah and and you know what's
[59:42] happened is um just due to the structure
[59:45] of the system uh this hyperf
[59:48] financialization that I mentioned before
[59:51] what this you know this uh what this
[59:54] means in effect uh here's a chart that
[59:57] shows tax receipts for the federal
[59:58] government how much income uh revenue is
[60:01] the government making and then it shows
[60:03] s&p500
[60:05] uh you can see that uh and I have a very
[60:08] in-depth post on this uh um the tax
[60:11] Foundation themselves basically say that
[60:14] like capital gains tax
[60:16] drives uh you know the performance of
[60:19] the S&P 500 and the performance of the
[60:21] stock market uh drives tax revenue for
[60:25] the federal government
[60:26] um and you know maybe maybe we should
[60:29] have a system where uh it it doesn't
[60:31] have such an outsized impact but you can
[60:34] clearly see here you know anytime uh
[60:36] there's a decline in the S&P 500 tax
[60:39] receipts or revenue for the government
[60:42] fall pretty pretty dramatically um and
[60:45] so that so this uh you know goes into a
[60:48] kind of concept I have that you know
[60:50] essentially assets can can and will only
[60:54] go up and to the right because the
[60:56] government needs them to um and
[61:00] unfortunately you know that that's not a
[61:02] healthy system that's not a system I
[61:04] like uh because that includes housing
[61:06] you know um and I want to buy a house
[61:08] and I want to start a family and and
[61:10] raise a child uh and have that kind of
[61:12] life that my parents did um so it it's
[61:15] depressing to say but just objectively
[61:18] you know the more the more data you look
[61:20] through the more you realize okay well
[61:23] if if you know the the American economy
[61:25] is hyper financialized and utterly and
[61:27] totally dependent on financial assets
[61:31] constantly going up and to the right
[61:34] well that is probably what's going to
[61:36] continue to happen just because that's
[61:38] what they need to have happen um and so
[61:40] this is just another way to kind of
[61:42] illustrate this hyperf
[61:45] financialization that has occurred as a
[61:47] direct result of the dollar being fiat
[61:50] currency of course uh you know number
[61:52] one and number two the Dollar's role as
[61:55] a Global Reserve currency um and and I I
[62:00] think this is just another good way to
[62:02] to to illustrate that hyperf
[62:06] financialization um and this gets into
[62:09] to kind of what I started to mention
[62:11] there um this shows in white the trade
[62:14] way to dollar Index um and so so the the
[62:20] the dollar uh uh metric that most people
[62:23] know is the dxy and that's useful and
[62:26] and I do use it um but the that that
[62:29] that dxy calculation um isn't altered
[62:35] based on how much trade we do with uh
[62:37] each one of the countries the euro is is
[62:40] like
[62:40] 45% of the dxy um and so so the dxy is
[62:46] in my opinion not as good of a measure
[62:49] to see the Dollar's True Performance um
[62:52] and the trade weight to Dollar I think
[62:54] is a much better uh way to look at the
[62:57] strength of the dollar um and we see
[62:59] that here in
[63:00] white going back to the early
[63:03] 2000s uh and then in red we see
[63:05] manufacturing employees as a share of
[63:09] total full-time workers um and of course
[63:12] manufa you know this if you were to go
[63:14] back to the 80s or the 70s uh this chart
[63:19] you know this red line would look
[63:20] exactly like the average hourly wage
[63:23] line that we were looking at before it's
[63:25] just straight down the entire time um
[63:29] and this is a direct result of
[63:31] Outsourcing our jobs and and in
[63:35] globalization um and and creating a
[63:38] system where we basically put our youth
[63:40] into ever in escapable debt um to get
[63:44] dollars so that we can send to the rest
[63:46] of the world China mainly uh and and
[63:50] have those dollars then recycled into
[63:52] our Capital markets so that uh you know
[63:54] to pump the value pump the wealth of the
[63:58] the wealthiest top 1% of the country I
[64:01] mean that you when you put it that way I
[64:04] think most people would agree that's a
[64:06] pretty broken system especially when the
[64:08] average hourly wage has been
[64:10] relentlessly declining as a you know
[64:13] divide by M2 divided by GDP you know the
[64:16] average worker has been getting totally
[64:18] screwed if the average worker had been
[64:21] you know doing okay I think you know uh
[64:24] there would be less anger and you
[64:26] wouldn't see the kind of populism uh and
[64:30] and ideological divisions that that
[64:33] polarization that we've seen I don't
[64:35] think any of that would be occurring if
[64:37] the average American had been you know
[64:39] keeping up uh like you said before I
[64:42] don't think any of that would be
[64:43] happening um this uh doesn't show the
[64:46] wage uh it just shows you know how out
[64:49] of all the full-time workers how many of
[64:52] them are manufacturing employees and you
[64:54] know like I said back to the 70s this
[64:57] chart just goes down the entire time um
[65:00] and this is this is a result of what
[65:03] what we get when you know a company can
[65:06] make something for one sth the cost in
[65:09] China um and you know it's great for the
[65:12] company uh their their profit margin
[65:15] increases right but uh when it comes to
[65:18] kind of the average middle class
[65:20] workingclass person in America sure they
[65:23] benefit from
[65:25] I would argue in some ways you know
[65:27] there are benefits to this uh I don't
[65:29] want to be 100% uh you know black or
[65:33] white on this issue uh you know we as
[65:36] Americans do get the benefit of lowcost
[65:39] goods um that is that is certainly one
[65:43] uh benefit um but you know I think I
[65:47] think hopefully you know when you look
[65:49] in the in the totality of the situation
[65:52] you know I know I would much rather give
[65:55] up uh a a $20 Amazon speaker right a
[65:59] Bluetooth speaker made in China I would
[66:02] much rather give that up and have a
[66:04] solid uh wage that that keeps up with
[66:08] GDP growth and keeps up with inflation
[66:11] uh you know where I can make enough
[66:13] money to afford a modest little single
[66:16] family home like I would much prefer
[66:19] that to being able to to buy a bunch of
[66:21] cheap plastic stuff on Amazon um and I
[66:24] think most people are getting to that to
[66:26] that point uh too and it's it's qu it's
[66:29] quality over o over everything like
[66:32] quality is so important that might sound
[66:36] weird for someone that does a podcast
[66:38] every day uh but I also do think that
[66:41] quality is the is the is the most
[66:44] important thing uh and sometimes you
[66:48] have the quantity bringing quality like
[66:51] if you have repetition and training and
[66:53] art forms and Sports and stuff like that
[66:57] but in terms of like that topic I think
[67:01] like quality is the most important of
[67:03] them
[67:04] all yeah I I totally agree like I I you
[67:09] know I would much I I I I would give up
[67:11] the cheap Amazon stuff in a in an
[67:13] instant uh if it meant that you know you
[67:17] could build wealth by providing value to
[67:20] uh the the country you know uh helping
[67:22] America and providing more value to
[67:24] American people um you know but
[67:26] currently really the way you get ahead
[67:28] in America is owning Financial assets
[67:30] and I think that's a fundamentally
[67:32] broken system uh and and this chart kind
[67:35] of illustrates the
[67:36] disparity um between how much how much
[67:41] investment do
[67:42] foreign uh countries have in American in
[67:46] you know US dollar denominated assets
[67:48] versus how much uh does America own of
[67:52] foreign assets uh whether that be
[67:54] foreign exchange
[67:56] uh reserves you know currencies or uh
[67:59] you know foreign denominated um assets
[68:02] denominated other currencies uh you know
[68:04] how much has America invested in the
[68:06] rest of the world versus how much has
[68:08] the rest of the world invested in
[68:10] America uh and like Luke groman talks
[68:14] about the net International Investment
[68:16] position uh you might have heard that
[68:18] phrase that that is basically what this
[68:20] is showing it's just a different way
[68:22] you're with this you're able to see each
[68:25] line
[68:26] independently um but that that that's
[68:28] basically this concept and you could see
[68:31] here in
[68:32] white um the foreigners own about $ 32
[68:36] trillion dollar according to the Fred um
[68:40] of of US dollar denominated assets and
[68:43] meanwhile America only owns about 16 and
[68:47] a half 17 trillion um and you see I you
[68:51] know it might be a little hard to to
[68:53] make out but you can see that those Jaws
[68:55] are are following
[68:58] 2019 uh you know in the recent kind of
[69:00] era uh postco you know covid and postco
[69:04] um that trend is is accelerating notably
[69:08] um and that corresponds to the trade
[69:11] deficit blowing out over the past couple
[69:14] years um and so again yeah I just go
[69:17] back to the this is a fundamentally
[69:19] broken system and tariffs uh yeah sure
[69:23] they might be one way to
[69:26] um try to Tinker around the edge uh and
[69:30] get some marginal uh uh Improvement in
[69:34] the trade
[69:35] balance um but you know really at the
[69:38] end of the day the dollar being the
[69:40] reserve currency of the world is the
[69:43] problem and we can Tinker around the
[69:46] edges with tariffs uh which I think is
[69:49] good and I do support tariffs um and I
[69:53] think they're much needed uh because
[69:55] trade is incredibly unfair um but unless
[69:59] we can tariff all we want until we
[70:01] address the dollars Reserve status uh
[70:05] nothing really meaningfully changes on a
[70:08] fundamental basis uh and what this chart
[70:10] basically shows is um tariffs in the
[70:14] first round of Trump's
[70:16] Administration uh and so PE people might
[70:18] have to zoom in or or if they're on
[70:21] their phone but uh I put you know little
[70:24] uh description of what was announced um
[70:28] during that time period uh and what this
[70:31] white line shows is the Chinese wand
[70:33] versus the US dollar um so that currency
[70:37] pair uh and you can see that from the
[70:39] minute that tariffs were first announced
[70:42] they weren't even put into effect um the
[70:46] Chinese wand started to weaken versus
[70:48] the dollar um and and and that Trend
[70:52] continued until basically co uh when it
[70:55] when it you know the the wand started to
[70:57] kind of rally versus the
[71:00] dollar um but you know a lot of people
[71:03] misunderstand this particular aspect and
[71:06] it and it plays into what kind of the
[71:08] globalization and uh the dollars Reserve
[71:11] status and triffin dilemma um and I
[71:15] think it's important an important part
[71:17] of the solution uh is tariffs and and
[71:21] you can see here in the lower pain the
[71:23] CPI uh year over-year change which is
[71:26] the quote unquote inflation metric that
[71:29] most people know and you can see that
[71:31] during that round of tariffs inflation
[71:33] was actually below 2% if if you ask the
[71:37] FED inflation was not high enough uh
[71:40] during that entire you know era of of
[71:44] tariffs against China so tariffs are not
[71:48] inherently inflationary if these other
[71:51] currencies weaken versus the dollar um
[71:54] right if the dollar is getting stronger
[71:57] uh on for fundamental reasons um then
[72:01] and these other currencies are getting
[72:03] weaker uh that can can completely offset
[72:07] any inflationary cost for Americans uh
[72:11] just as a very simple example you know
[72:12] if we put a 10% tariff on Mexico uh say
[72:16] they have they probably have 10% tariffs
[72:18] on our stuff uh but say you know we we
[72:21] do a reciprocal Tariff of 10% for all
[72:24] Mexican Goods but then the peso Falls
[72:27] 10% versus the US dollar Americans don't
[72:30] pay any more for an avocado the currency
[72:33] Channel completely offset any
[72:36] inflationary impact from that tariff um
[72:39] and and I think it's an important part
[72:41] of the solution so I wanted to mention
[72:44] uh uh this you know T tariffs and and we
[72:47] are clearly going into a a world of De
[72:51] globalization um and and a move away or
[72:54] a move toward a multi-polar world um
[72:58] which I think uh gets into the the
[73:01] solution which is Bitcoin and uh I I
[73:04] couldn't agree more and yeah tariffs are
[73:06] like a good thing uh but as you said
[73:09] like the real real problem is the money
[73:12] not not missing tariffs that that that's
[73:15] that's the that's the real thing um we
[73:18] are
[73:19] already um like 70 minutes in so that's
[73:23] that the time flew by very quickly today
[73:26] um I think I guess we we will make a
[73:29] second part on this uh and and dive deep
[73:32] on bitcoin uh because we really describe
[73:37] now in like 70 minutes what the problem
[73:41] is what what what what's the cause also
[73:43] of the problem uh and this is amazing to
[73:47] see I think it it's an eye opener for a
[73:49] lot and it's also good for even the
[73:52] people like me that are already aware of
[73:54] the problem um to having that con
[73:58] concise in in like one video I think
[74:01] that's that's really great uh so thank
[74:03] you so much already for for for doing
[74:05] that and and bringing that to to to our
[74:08] podcast uh and maybe we can focus on the
[74:11] second part that we do in like half a
[74:13] year or year or something like that um
[74:16] uh more on bitcoin and and the things of
[74:19] that uh but um is there something you
[74:24] want to talk about on bitcoin
[74:26] specifically without diving too deep
[74:27] because otherwise I think we two three
[74:30] hours yeah sure of course I mean the the
[74:32] solution is pretty simple that that
[74:34] that's the cool part is is the you know
[74:36] Bitcoin being the solution this part is
[74:39] the easy part um what we need is uh if
[74:43] the dollar uh Reserve status right and
[74:47] the dollar is the problem the solution
[74:50] is something that is neutral and that
[74:52] freely floats in all currencies um and
[74:55] you know be before Bitcoin of course
[74:58] this was gold um and during the
[75:00] mercantilist era you know from the 1300s
[75:02] on this was how it worked you know if a
[75:05] country was um producing more value for
[75:09] the rest of the world than they were
[75:10] consuming the gold would flow into that
[75:14] country right um very similar to a
[75:17] bitcoiner right if you're producing more
[75:18] value for the world then you're
[75:20] consuming Bitcoin you can accumulate
[75:22] Bitcoin and grow your Bitcoin uh it it
[75:25] should really be no different for
[75:28] countries the entire thing is broken uh
[75:31] due to the dollars Reserve status um but
[75:34] at the end of the day that is how a a
[75:36] fair and free um International Trade
[75:40] system works is you know countries are
[75:43] incentivized to produce more value for
[75:45] the rest of the world than they consume
[75:47] you know gold or Andor Bitcoin you know
[75:50] a neutral asset uh flows into the
[75:54] country and that country stack gets
[75:56] bigger and their currency gets stronger
[75:59] right they they are in a stronger
[76:01] economic position their currency is uh
[76:05] stronger and and really it's that simple
[76:08] um that's the cool part you know Mar
[76:10] logo Accord uh I think has to have uh
[76:14] some kind of wonky um nerdy stuff
[76:18] attached but at the end of the day you
[76:20] know like the one is is is way too weak
[76:23] uh versus the dollar on a fundamental
[76:25] balance of payments basis um as as one
[76:29] of many things they have to address but
[76:31] generally speaking the solution is very
[76:33] very simple uh which is you know a move
[76:36] away from the dollar being in dollar
[76:38] denominated assets being the reserve
[76:41] asset for the world and a move towards
[76:45] uh gold and Bitcoin you know um either
[76:47] both gold and Bitcoin serve have all the
[76:51] properties uh that are needed uh to
[76:54] serve as a global Reserve asset um I
[76:56] just personally believe and I know a lot
[76:58] of bitcoiners uh believe Bitcoin you
[77:01] know you go down that list of properties
[77:03] and Bitcoin is just objectively better
[77:05] than gold uh in every single one of them
[77:09] uh so the solution is quite simple you
[77:11] know and luckily we have Bitcoin um as
[77:15] individuals um and I think that you know
[77:17] over the next few years maybe the next
[77:19] decade um countries will start to be uh
[77:23] grateful for having B
[77:27] that's uh very true and we we already
[77:29] see that happening right the countries
[77:31] already start doing do doing the things
[77:34] and already start exploring the Bitcoin
[77:37] option in in that way yep yep and I
[77:41] think that'll continue um a as these you
[77:44] know I I'm a big uh fan of like
[77:47] structural demographic Theory like Peter
[77:49] turchin and Neil how and those guys um
[77:52] and they talk in these you know 60 70
[77:54] year Cycles uh these these kind of
[77:57] Lifetime longer lifetime cycles of 60 70
[78:00] 80 years um and you know what we've seen
[78:03] over the past 60 70 80 years is uh
[78:06] increasing globalization and I think
[78:09] that you know much like we're going to
[78:11] be see higher interest rates for the
[78:13] next 50 years uh I think that we will
[78:16] see less uh globalization over the next
[78:19] 50 years I think that countries will
[78:21] start focusing on their own people uh
[78:24] who have been IGN for far too long uh as
[78:26] all the all of our graphs show um and I
[78:30] and I think that we will you know it's
[78:32] not just a flash in the pan uh it feels
[78:36] like this is going to stick um and like
[78:39] you mentioned you know it's not just
[78:40] America kind of going this direction
[78:42] this is also happening in the rest of
[78:44] the world too um like throughout Europe
[78:47] so I think that uh it's interesting
[78:49] times to live in uh I think that it's a
[78:52] very lucrative time to live in uh given
[78:55] what Bitcoin
[78:56] represents um and the properties of
[78:58] Bitcoin I think it it's going to be very
[79:01] lucrative for those that hold Bitcoin uh
[79:03] but generally speaking I think it's
[79:05] going to be extremely positive for the
[79:07] average American uh who has been working
[79:10] their butt off uh you know trying to
[79:12] just survive and keep up with this ever
[79:15] increasing hurdle rate um uh uh you know
[79:18] due to debasement and asset inflation
[79:21] and you know that average guy uh who who
[79:24] is
[79:25] drowning is going to you know hopefully
[79:28] we are able to construct a better system
[79:31] um and make modifications where they
[79:33] need to be made and and you know help
[79:36] that guy for once because you know the
[79:38] average dude has not been getting helped
[79:40] as all the the first couple charts show
[79:44] um and I think it's time that you know
[79:45] the average American that works for a
[79:47] living uh sees some benefit from right
[79:50] like America is so great and it's the
[79:52] strongest economy in the world well you
[79:54] look at average early wage versus GDP
[79:56] it's not it's not the the average
[79:59] American is not seeing any of that
[80:01] strength right so so I think it's time
[80:03] you know to to to try to rebuild a
[80:05] better system um and and prioritize that
[80:09] average guy you know who make up 90
[80:11] something percent of the country um I
[80:14] think it's critically important because
[80:16] if we do not um sure the current system
[80:19] can continue but eventually we get to a
[80:22] point where Marie Antoinette seem
[80:25] are playing out on the streets of
[80:27] Manhattan and Los Angeles in San
[80:29] Francisco and Washington DC and I don't
[80:32] want that um I don't think any of us
[80:35] want that you know I I think we want to
[80:36] build something better
[80:38] peacefully uh and I think it is possible
[80:41] I think it is possible and Bitcoin you
[80:43] know thank God for Bitcoin because gold
[80:45] certainly has some pretty notable flaws
[80:48] uh you know that that that make Bitcoin
[80:51] a much better alternative uh for for
[80:54] this uh this trend change really cool
[80:57] and I man it's been an amazing podcast
[81:00] um we have one question that uh I have
[81:03] one question that I asked each and every
[81:04] one of my guests and the question is
[81:07] what can we learn from you besides
[81:09] Bitcoin oh boy
[81:11] um well the industry that I I I've
[81:14] worked in the healthcare industry so my
[81:15] day job um I've worked in Behavioral
[81:19] Health uh and so that's part of the
[81:22] reason I think that I uh gravitate in
[81:24] the very first couple charts to overdose
[81:26] deaths and suicides um is that that's
[81:29] kind of the industry I've worked in for
[81:31] the past 15 years um and yeah I I I
[81:35] would say I I would just offer um if
[81:38] anyone is struggling with mental health
[81:40] issues or uh drug addiction issues um
[81:44] feel free to reach out to me on Twitter
[81:46] um I I've be more than happy to try to
[81:49] give my wisdom um and my experience with
[81:54] that um and you know it it unfortunately
[81:57] that is an Ever growing segment of the
[82:00] population uh so I would just say I
[82:02] would just make that offer um you know
[82:04] I've been doing it for 15 something 16
[82:06] years and uh I know it's I know it's
[82:09] troubling a lot of people I know a lot
[82:12] of people are hurting um and so yeah
[82:14] just uh shoot me a DM and we can talk I
[82:18] can hopefully uh help your situation uh
[82:21] if nothing if nothing else sometimes
[82:23] just listening to someone uh can be
[82:26] helpful so that's what I would say uh
[82:29] really cool and as always I mean I
[82:31] usually ask that later but uh we can do
[82:33] it now as always I do your um link uh to
[82:39] Twitter in the description so people can
[82:41] find it easily and don't have to search
[82:43] on Twitter uh for half an hour to get to
[82:46] your Twitter um so if they want to reach
[82:49] out to you they can just go on the
[82:50] description or if you're already on
[82:53] Twitter you can see the taged account
[82:56] above uh but like usually it's in the
[82:59] description and just reach out to him um
[83:02] we have a end routine in the podcast
[83:03] where the previous guest is asking a
[83:05] question for the next guest without
[83:07] knowing who the next guest actually is
[83:09] and the previous guest asks you the
[83:10] question how do you feel about physical
[83:13] Fiat cash um you know I think I think a
[83:16] small amount uh is is helpful you know
[83:19] there there are some situations where uh
[83:22] physical Fiat cash
[83:25] um could be beneficial uh you know if
[83:28] there was uh some kind of issue with the
[83:31] power or the internet um and we live in
[83:33] an increasingly digital age uh you know
[83:37] at least in the early stage um Fiat cash
[83:40] would actually be uh you know quite
[83:42] helpful to have some of that on hand I
[83:45] would say you know physical anything
[83:48] right like matters in that kind of world
[83:50] uh even physical silver and and and
[83:53] physical gold anything that that people
[83:56] agree has value in a physical form is
[83:59] super important if the power goes out or
[84:01] the internet goes out like a Cyber
[84:03] attack or something like that
[84:04] interesting yeah that's uh phys like
[84:07] physical cash and maybe even like small
[84:10] gold coins like smaller ones uh uh and
[84:15] it's like a survival kit of the worst
[84:19] things is happening
[84:22] currently a bit of Aer
[84:25] yeah it's I think it's not bad like I
[84:28] think it's good actually I actually do
[84:30] have physical gold also um uh in here
[84:35] like a very small amount but uh
[84:38] something that is probably not even
[84:41] getting me through a week but maybe
[84:43] through a few
[84:44] days uh so that that that's something
[84:48] but I don't have it because of that
[84:49] actually I have it because of emotional
[84:51] reasons uh so that that's just uh
[84:54] something that I hold on to because I
[84:55] want to remember something uh but it it
[84:58] is an interesting point of like okay
[85:00] what do you do if like right now over
[85:02] night everything falls down like how
[85:05] much physical cash do you have and and
[85:07] how much gold do you have in your your
[85:09] basement H maybe you want to prepare a
[85:11] little bit and allocate like one two% of
[85:15] your uh that's what I would say yeah
[85:17] yeah like something one two
[85:19] three% yeah yeah not a lot not not you
[85:23] know not a lot because it's a melting
[85:25] Ice Cube otherwise it's a melting Ice
[85:27] Cube for a situation that probably never
[85:30] happens yeah exactly
[85:33] exactly really cool thank you it was an
[85:35] honor to have you on I think uh you
[85:38] brought some really good wisdom and a
[85:40] lot of great charts and numbers uh here
[85:43] and I think it was eye opening for a lot
[85:44] of people we already mentioned that uh
[85:47] we can find you on on Twitter so thank
[85:49] you so much for for for being on for for
[85:52] being such a great guest uh here today
[85:55] and yeah also thank you so much for
