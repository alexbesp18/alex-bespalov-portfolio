[00:00] from the Roman Empire up into the United
[00:02] States right now the same mistakes are
[00:04] made over and over again truly history
[00:06] repeats itself eventually the rugs going
[00:08] to be pulled out on this trust train and
[00:10] when it is if you're not out of the
[00:11] system it'll be too late they're going
[00:13] to try to sell us this Central Bank
[00:14] digital currency that it's better but in
[00:16] reality when they make that change
[00:18] official that's when trust is going to
[00:19] be completely lost and all Fiat
[00:21] currencies will hyperinflate two
[00:23] different systems a communist socialist
[00:25] system and a true free market capitalism
[00:27] system and thankfully because there is
[00:29] some essence of free market remaining
[00:31] we're seeing Bitcoin in the internet
[00:33] economy out compete any currency of any
[00:35] real world economy and that trend is
[00:37] going to accelerate coin is that
[00:38] engineered money that was that can do
[00:40] what gold and us treasuries could never
[00:42] do deliver you the hardness but also the
[00:45] fast cheap and easy and secure
[00:46] settlement if there's any coin or any
[00:48] project out there that says we're
[00:50] competing with Bitcoin you shouldn't get
[00:51] near it with a thot pole because it's a
[00:53] scam we already have perfect money it's
[00:57] Bitcoin um I have you on my because
[01:00] someone else said you are an OG Bitcoin
[01:03] Maxi and I should have you definitely on
[01:06] so uh first question to you would you
[01:08] self self describe you as a OG Bitcoin
[01:13] Maxi I would describe me as a Bitcoin
[01:15] Maxi I mean what does what does OG
[01:18] really even mean I guess this is my my
[01:21] 10th year in the space so I do have a
[01:23] couple having Cycles under my belt but
[01:27] uh anybody is an OG Maxi who can embrace
[01:29] the mindset that Bitcoin is engineered
[01:32] money that Bitcoin is the solution to a
[01:35] lot of the problems that we're facing
[01:37] today so to me OG means that you've
[01:40] evolved your mind you've learned from
[01:42] the failures of fiat currency
[01:44] experiments and you've come to the
[01:46] conclusion that the fiat currency system
[01:49] isn't going to work so do I have an OG
[01:52] mindset that understands Bitcoin as the
[01:54] reserve asset of the internet economy
[01:56] and the most pristine form of collateral
[01:58] in the world absolutely
[02:00] and this is a perfectly a line up for
[02:03] for the the question like you probably
[02:06] think that Fiat currencies will collapse
[02:08] at some point
[02:10] right yeah you know that's a really
[02:13] tough topic because a a lot of people
[02:16] ask me that like when's it going to
[02:17] happen when's it going to happen well
[02:20] I've studied a lot of different Fiat
[02:21] currencies like more than I should have
[02:23] to be honest my time could have been
[02:25] better invested somewhere else but what
[02:27] you learn when you study these is that
[02:29] there's never been a success I mean
[02:32] thousands of currencies hundreds and
[02:34] hundreds of failures nothing has ever
[02:37] worked from the Roman Empire up into the
[02:40] United States right now the same
[02:42] mistakes are made over and over again
[02:44] truly history repeats itself but what
[02:46] I've noticed is even though the economic
[02:49] books will give you the definition of
[02:50] hyperinflation and they try to
[02:52] mathematically Define this the move from
[02:54] inflation to hyperinflation I disagree
[02:56] with that I find that the only
[02:58] difference between infl and
[03:00] hyperinflation is trust when the people
[03:03] lose trust in the system when the people
[03:05] no longer trust the government to watch
[03:08] out for their best when the people
[03:10] understand that the system is being
[03:11] abused and therefore the value of their
[03:13] time and labor is being extracted from
[03:16] them trust is lost and once that trust
[03:18] is lost we will move into hyperinflation
[03:21] regardless of what's done to counteract
[03:23] it so to me the there's no mathematical
[03:26] textbook definition of hyperinflation
[03:29] it's the loss of trust that shifts us
[03:30] from inflation to hyperinflation and do
[03:33] I think that's going to happen ask
[03:35] yourself a question do you trust your
[03:37] government more today or more yesterday
[03:40] which way is the the the trend of trust
[03:42] going eventually the rug's going to be
[03:44] pulled out on this trust train and when
[03:46] it is if you're not out of the system
[03:49] it'll be too
[03:50] late yeah I'm totally agree with that
[03:53] and it's it's it's fascinating for me
[03:54] that um when I talk with Bitcoin now
[03:57] most of them think that feat will
[04:00] collapse at some point it just cannot
[04:02] live on for longer but what what I
[04:04] wonder is they always come up with
[04:06] something like they always come up like
[04:07] like the Euro failed but let's invent a
[04:10] new currency it has this and this new
[04:12] like what do you think will will
[04:14] probably happen like like when there's a
[04:17] Bitcoin standard there's a time before
[04:19] that and I think there's a time after
[04:21] that let's focus on the time before that
[04:23] what do you think government will try to
[04:25] do to keep the currencies alive is the
[04:28] digital euro is the uh the centr B uh
[04:32] the cbdc is part of that to keep it
[04:35] running
[04:36] longer absolutely Central Bank digital
[04:39] currencies and every look what happened
[04:42] in the 70s was this country was sold out
[04:45] from itself it was raid and our whole
[04:48] economy was basically transitioned or
[04:50] sold to China so everything you see
[04:53] happening in China today is the testing
[04:55] ground for everything else and look at
[04:57] what they're doing in China they have
[04:59] over 7 100 million CCTV cameras they're
[05:02] issuing credit scores based on social
[05:05] interaction and social behavior it's a
[05:07] complete control system but they're not
[05:09] going to sell it to you like that right
[05:11] they're going to sell it to you in a
[05:12] good way like for every cash dollar you
[05:15] turn in get to Central Bank digital
[05:17] currencies there's there's going to be
[05:19] warped incentives there's going to be
[05:21] tricks there's going to be lies there's
[05:23] going to be deception to try to tell us
[05:25] that the Central Bank digital currency
[05:27] is better for Humanity that the Central
[05:29] Bank digital currency is the evolution
[05:32] of money when in reality Bitcoin is the
[05:34] Natural Evolution of money and Fiat is a
[05:37] scam it's not even money it's currency
[05:39] right gold was money because that's a
[05:42] hard money with all the characteristics
[05:44] of it Bitcoin is an engineered money
[05:47] it's gold 2.0 cbdcs are going backwards
[05:50] it's Devolution it's complete control
[05:53] it's trying to take over the free market
[05:55] price signal it's trying to give the
[05:57] governments complete control over
[05:59] resource allocation that's the main goal
[06:02] with this Central Bank digital currency
[06:04] and I think much like in Yar Germany
[06:07] where they were having hardcore
[06:09] inflation but it wasn't quite
[06:11] hyperinflation trust wasn't lost yet
[06:14] they came out and released a new
[06:15] currency right and they had this big
[06:17] agenda and a great probably you know
[06:20] akin to today's style it was a fantastic
[06:23] PowerPoint presentation it was a great
[06:25] deck right youve seen this and you're
[06:26] like oh my goodness this is it's got all
[06:29] the keywords it's it's beautiful this is
[06:31] going to work we can sell this well the
[06:33] people didn't buy it and as soon as they
[06:35] launched that new currency the trust was
[06:37] lost and in wear Germany they shifted
[06:40] from inflation to hyperinflation I see
[06:42] the same thing coming here they're
[06:43] they're going to try to sell us this
[06:45] Central Bank digital currency that it's
[06:46] better and they're going to have all
[06:48] these lying talking points and
[06:50] deceptions and they're going to speak it
[06:52] as truth but in reality when they make
[06:54] that change official I think at that
[06:57] time that's when trust is going to be
[06:59] completely lost and all theat currencies
[07:01] will
[07:03] hyperinflate do you see a good
[07:04] transition like I I think like when I
[07:07] talk with people about Bitcoin there are
[07:09] those people that's like okay let's try
[07:11] let's see and put it as a luxury item
[07:15] like one five% of my portfolio in there
[07:18] someone's like oh it's too speculative I
[07:19] don't want it there's so much fat out
[07:22] there and it's like when you talk with
[07:24] them you can read the headlines of the
[07:26] newspapers they reading the them in your
[07:29] phase um how do you see this transition
[07:33] H transition happening are people just
[07:36] forced into Bitcoin because it's some
[07:37] point it's so obvious that it's the best
[07:40] store of value ever uh or do we actually
[07:43] have to educate them like how do you see
[07:45] this transition to bitcoin and why
[07:48] Bitcoin
[07:50] explanation yeah so uh two points to
[07:53] make on this the first is that um I do
[07:56] think and snow Snowden came out and said
[07:58] this the other day which is that they're
[08:00] going to have to uh governments are
[08:03] going to have to come out and admit or
[08:05] or information will be leaked that a big
[08:07] government is accumulating Bitcoin
[08:09] without admitting it at some point in
[08:11] time governments are going to have to
[08:13] admit it look at what's happening at El
[08:14] Salvador El Salvador was a broken
[08:17] country it was a dangerous country and
[08:20] it was uh Laden with debt and now
[08:24] they're paying off their debt and what's
[08:26] happening is because they are holding
[08:28] Bitcoin on their balance sheet
[08:30] the asset side of their balance sheet is
[08:32] growing and what that does is it it
[08:34] shrinks the liability side of their
[08:36] balance sheet and you see JP Morgan
[08:39] increasing their credit the credit
[08:40] agency agencies are increasing their
[08:42] credit it's not going to be long before
[08:44] governments figure out that lending to
[08:47] each other is not the most Lisk
[08:49] risk-free form of lending but lending to
[08:52] a bitcoin-backed economy is the least
[08:55] risk-free form of lending that's a big
[08:57] thing that's going to happen that I
[08:58] don't think thek Market is talking about
[09:01] right now how Bitcoin changes the
[09:03] Paradigm for what qualifies as risk-free
[09:07] Government debt is not risk-free us
[09:09] treasuries are not the risk-free rate of
[09:11] return Bitcoin is and a hybrid
[09:14] debt-based Bitcoin commodity credit
[09:16] market like we're building at people's
[09:17] Reserve is going to be the future of
[09:20] Bitcoin setting free market interest
[09:22] rates not Central Bankers so that's a
[09:24] really big transition that will be
[09:25] forced on everybody just based on
[09:27] natural economic incentives the first
[09:30] thing you said though that is also very
[09:31] interesting is people are like oh it's
[09:34] too risky you know won the 5% allocation
[09:37] their mindset is completely backwards
[09:39] because they're laboring for Fiat money
[09:41] so in their in their eyes that when they
[09:43] labor for the fiat currency that's like
[09:46] their base unit that's like their least
[09:48] risky unit but in reality the dollar
[09:51] that we we trade our labor for the
[09:53] dollar or for any Fiat that is the risky
[09:56] investment you should take whatever you
[09:58] earn from your labor and pay your bills
[10:00] but whatever's left over run from it as
[10:02] fast as you can you can't save in it you
[10:04] can't look if you think you can save in
[10:05] it then you're not good at math so
[10:07] listen to somebody who is good at math
[10:08] and telling you you cannot save real
[10:10] rates are negative real interest rates
[10:12] are negative the rate of inflation is
[10:14] higher than the rate of interest earned
[10:16] therefore you're losing purchasing power
[10:18] you can't do that and they still have
[10:21] this mindset that they're running into
[10:22] the Fiats for safety that one to two 5%
[10:25] is 1 to 5% is too risky well Bitcoin is
[10:29] money so your allocation to money should
[10:31] be 100% that's what your allocation to
[10:34] money should be and then your wants and
[10:36] your desires and your needs like a home
[10:40] and food and transportation that takes
[10:43] away from your Bitcoin that takes away
[10:44] from your allocation you have to take
[10:46] portions of your labor and trade it off
[10:48] in order to have those things and then
[10:50] your wants and desires further take away
[10:52] from your allocation so your Bitcoin
[10:54] allocation should be 100% And if it's
[10:57] not 100% you're not an OG bitcoiner and
[11:00] you don't really understand what's
[11:01] happening here what's happening is the
[11:04] the governments are transitioning us
[11:07] there's a huge transfer of wealth taking
[11:09] place right now and all of your lines of
[11:11] questions are great because they tie
[11:13] together that lost of trust the forceful
[11:15] transition they want to go to the
[11:17] central bank digital controllers a
[11:20] centralized control system that gives
[11:23] the power to set prices to everything
[11:24] not just interest rates Bitcoin is
[11:26] coming along in a decentralized fashion
[11:28] and saying no we don't want anybody to
[11:31] control our money we want everybody to
[11:32] have the same rules and we want a A
[11:35] system that doesn't favor any one person
[11:38] no matter how big or small over another
[11:41] so what we see is two different systems
[11:43] a communist socialist system and a true
[11:45] free market capitalism system and
[11:48] thankfully because there is some essence
[11:50] of free market remaining we're seeing
[11:52] Bitcoin in the internet economy out
[11:55] compete any currency of any real world
[11:57] economy and that trend is going to
[12:00] accelerate I also think a lot about what
[12:03] happened in Germany with uh the two
[12:05] sides of of of Germany with the wall and
[12:08] everything that came down like not that
[12:10] long ago actually and you see just
[12:13] different developments with free market
[12:14] and
[12:15] communism uh and what I see uh with with
[12:19] Bitcoin and uh this loss in trust like I
[12:24] stack purposely for people I love around
[12:28] me that don't get now because I think I
[12:31] want to care for them because just
[12:33] because they don't get it does not mean
[12:35] they don't deserve it because I love
[12:36] them and I want to care for them but so
[12:39] many people don't uh have this like they
[12:42] don't have some Bitcoin in their sphere
[12:45] and they they don't get it maybe and do
[12:47] you see like from all this things coming
[12:50] up uh some social conflicts arising
[12:55] something that could be uh like even
[12:58] World War I
[13:00] scenarios like for that like is there
[13:02] something you see like there's loss of
[13:04] trust there's something new coming up um
[13:08] systems are taking down new systems are
[13:10] coming up governments are going wild is
[13:13] there something you see on the horizon
[13:16] uh obviously I want the peaceful uh
[13:18] Revolution a peaceful uh transition to a
[13:20] sound money system but there can be a
[13:23] scenario where it's just not
[13:26] peaceful unfortunately yeah yeah I mean
[13:29] we we all know the the new world order
[13:32] the world economic Forum the powers that
[13:35] be whatever you want to whatever name
[13:36] you want to give them they're saying is
[13:39] order out of chaos right so they they
[13:41] kind of want this chaos to come because
[13:44] out of that chaos they can rearrange the
[13:46] order to their liking and I think what
[13:49] Bitcoin does is it actually gives us a
[13:52] chance to have a what's I want to make
[13:55] sure I use the right word here I think
[13:57] Bitcoin gives us the chance
[13:59] to have that peaceful transition and the
[14:02] reason I say that is because as long as
[14:04] Bitcoin is priced in fiat currency it's
[14:07] going to perform exactly as it was
[14:09] designed to perform it's it's engineered
[14:12] money so what people need to understand
[14:14] is that if they print money and abuse
[14:17] the system as long as you spend the
[14:19] money that you need to spend on your
[14:20] bills and then you take your savings and
[14:22] you put it in Bitcoin you can't be
[14:24] harmed there's nothing that they can do
[14:26] to you so it kind of It kind of buys us
[14:29] time I look at the traditional system
[14:32] and I look at treasury notes and I look
[14:34] at Rising interest rates and I look at
[14:36] the the base layer money collateral of
[14:38] the entire system breaking down in front
[14:41] of everybody's eyes and I say wow the
[14:44] foundations of Finance are falling apart
[14:47] we are cracking at the seams and then
[14:49] Bitcoin comes in and a lot of people
[14:52] look at it as like this big sword that's
[14:55] going to come and just destroy the old
[14:57] system I don't I think we're seeing
[15:00] vertical integration of Bitcoin right
[15:02] Bitcoin is being institutionalized as
[15:04] digital gold on Wall Street Bitcoin is
[15:07] being recognized as the risk-free rate
[15:10] of energy for energy producers Bitcoin
[15:13] is being recognized for heat capture um
[15:17] and and waste capture for the good of
[15:18] the environment and being vertically
[15:20] integrated into those businesses to
[15:22] increase bottom lines the free the free
[15:25] market incentives are very imp are very
[15:28] powerful around Bitcoin and we're seeing
[15:30] those incentives Drive the marketplace
[15:33] and those incentives to no one's surpris
[15:36] that that has an OG bitcoiner mindset is
[15:38] out incentivizing the traditional trafi
[15:41] incentives so if we can we can continue
[15:43] to see this happen I'm hopeful that we
[15:46] can have a peaceful transition and
[15:48] Bitcoin can be there as that engineered
[15:50] money to help us navigate this transfer
[15:53] of wealth but that's just what I want
[15:57] there it's definitely plausible that
[15:59] don't have a peaceful transition and out
[16:01] of that chaos we see cbdcs we see
[16:04] tyranny we see all of this stuff pop up
[16:07] wait I mean we've kind of seen it
[16:09] already from from covid right like we're
[16:11] we're still in the fall that the
[16:12] governments want you to believe oh we
[16:14] recovered from covid everything is fine
[16:16] now we're on to new new higher levels
[16:18] that's behind us we're we're actually
[16:20] Living Through The Fallout of covid this
[16:22] is the inflationary recession prices
[16:25] still go up you feel richer but your
[16:27] standard of living and your quality of
[16:29] Life Decline and Bitcoin for us it
[16:31] protects us it protects our standard of
[16:33] living it protects our quality of life
[16:35] and people who are not having Bitcoin
[16:38] and even just a little bit of exposure
[16:39] to bitcoin like you said one to two% in
[16:42] Bitcoin and people feel comfortable
[16:44] because that's how effective Bitcoin is
[16:47] but really you got to be at 100% Bitcoin
[16:50] because it's the only money it might
[16:51] actually be the first discovery of real
[16:54] money in humanity I'm not sure gold
[16:56] actually
[16:57] qualifies coin is is so important to
[17:01] what Humanity can do as we move forward
[17:03] that I hope we have that peaceful
[17:06] transition where Bitcoin can slowly
[17:08] become part of the system and be
[17:11] vertically integrated rather than a a
[17:13] complete collapse and
[17:15] rebuild I love it Bitcoin as the first
[17:18] actual money discovered I never thought
[17:20] about that uh because I usually when I
[17:24] orange be people I ask them okay what's
[17:26] the perfect money look like and then
[17:29] they tell me the properties they think
[17:31] that suited for money and then I'm like
[17:33] okay you just describe Bitcoin here
[17:35] because if if if if you actually ask
[17:38] people what they want from money uh they
[17:42] this this they instinctively know what
[17:44] good money is they not like oh I wanted
[17:46] to keep my value I wanted to spend it
[17:49] everywhere like the the the the things
[17:52] that they contribut to perfect money uh
[17:54] is Bitcoin and uh before we go on
[17:57] further in the in the conversation I
[17:59] just wanted to one question came up to
[18:02] me when when you said like Bitcoin
[18:03] should be 100% in Bitcoin I totally
[18:05] agree with that and when we go to the
[18:08] scenario where there's there's not this
[18:11] peaceful Revolution uh but there is an
[18:13] unpeaceful Revolution going on um what
[18:16] can bitcoiners do that already are 100%
[18:20] in Bitcoin to prepare or like be
[18:22] cautious about that should is there no
[18:24] Co KC buying coin training mixing self
[18:27] custody do you have any
[18:29] like recommendations for people that to
[18:32] prepare for stuff like
[18:34] that yeah actually I I do recommend that
[18:38] people own some gold and some silver and
[18:42] the reason I say that is because if the
[18:45] systems collapse you're not going to be
[18:47] able to move your Bitcoin back and forth
[18:49] you're going to have to wait like it's
[18:50] going to be there it's not going to
[18:52] disappear it's going to be there for you
[18:53] everything's going to be fine when when
[18:55] the systems come back online but as the
[18:57] systems are offline to me in in one of
[19:00] those doomsday scenarios where at this
[19:02] point you know we're hoping and praying
[19:04] that's not the case but it's plausible
[19:06] so you have to you have to be prepared
[19:08] if something's plausible and I think
[19:10] having a little bit of gold and and more
[19:13] importantly I think silver is important
[19:15] because historically that's barter
[19:17] ability right so let's just say the
[19:19] internet or systems go down and we don't
[19:21] have mass communications for three
[19:23] months maybe six months what are you
[19:26] doing in those three to six months like
[19:27] bitcoin's going to do it job it's going
[19:29] to protect your value it's going to be
[19:30] where it is but in the meantime when
[19:33] we're trying to figure out some societal
[19:35] and culture issues what are you doing
[19:37] for security what are you doing for
[19:39] barter ability that one ounce of silver
[19:42] might be able to buy you a worker for a
[19:44] whole day so have smaller than even one
[19:46] ounces of silver be ready to barter be
[19:48] ready to have a community behind you
[19:51] right because what do you need you need
[19:52] water you need food you need energy you
[19:55] need security all of these things in
[19:57] that Doomsday scario you can you could
[19:59] be a Bitcoin billionaire and it won't
[20:01] matter if you're not prepared for that
[20:03] plausible uh outcome so there you know
[20:06] there are some other things we have to
[20:07] pay attention to but once you once you
[20:11] get those things checked off your list
[20:12] you're able to protect your family
[20:14] you're able to barter God forbid if the
[20:16] if the grid goes down for a little bit
[20:18] uh and you're able to produce some food
[20:20] or water or at least trade with somebody
[20:22] who is um go out and meet local farmers
[20:26] go out go a little bit out the suburbs
[20:28] and start me some of the farmers see if
[20:29] they'll take Bitcoin establish
[20:31] relationships build community go face to
[20:34] face don't stay in in Bitcoin Twitter
[20:36] don't stay in the internet make real
[20:39] world friends and real world connections
[20:41] strengthen those networks because if
[20:43]  hits the
[20:45] fan it's those connections that are
[20:47] going to save you not Bitcoin so that's
[20:50] an important I think that's a really
[20:52] great question an important mindset for
[20:54] people to have that to understand yeah
[20:56] if everything stays together bitcoin's
[20:58] going to do everything it needs to do
[20:59] for me but if Things Fall Apart you
[21:01] still have to be able to protect
[21:02] yourself and your family and Bitcoin
[21:04] will enable you to do that too right
[21:06] because it's it's increasing your
[21:08] purchasing power I I I'll add on one
[21:11] thing because of what you said before
[21:12] you asked the question about Bitcoin as
[21:15] money the perfect money and maybe the
[21:16] first form of money because if you think
[21:19] about it even gold what's really
[21:20] interesting
[21:22] is the there's I have an analysis on my
[21:25] Twitter everybody should check it out
[21:26] it's called value versus cost versus
[21:29] price and what I found in my studies is
[21:32] that the confusion between value cost
[21:35] and price
[21:37] um it just creates the misunderstanding
[21:40] that people have right now that makes
[21:41] them feel safe in dollars but if you
[21:44] understand the basic laws of economics
[21:46] and price Discovery and you understand
[21:49] the relationship between a value
[21:51] proposition a cost of production and a
[21:53] market price well then you start to
[21:56] really understand bitcoin's engineered
[21:58] design because the value proposition of
[22:02] Bitcoin is money well the the base layer
[22:05] of demand for money is larger than
[22:07] anything in the world because it's 50%
[22:09] of every single transaction in the world
[22:12] so there is no base layer demand it
[22:13] doesn't matter if your gold and your
[22:15] silver for your electronics and for your
[22:17] jewelry and all and dentistry and all
[22:19] that no no no the largest base layer of
[22:21] demand in the world is money so the
[22:23] value proposition of money is global GDP
[22:27] divided by 21 million and that's where
[22:29] the infinity divided by 21 million meme
[22:31] comes from because the potential of
[22:33] humanity the potential of GDP growth is
[22:35] Limitless so it's Global GDP or human
[22:40] potential which is infinity divided by
[22:42] the 21 million coins that's the value
[22:45] proposition ultimately price the market
[22:47] price will get to the value proposition
[22:51] but how does it do that well it does it
[22:53] by cost being pushed up towards price
[22:57] that's the engineered design of bitco
[22:58] when you look at gold when the cost of
[23:01] gold goes down the price of gold will go
[23:04] down so the the the gold I say gold is
[23:07] not actually money and Bitcoin is the
[23:09] first discovery of money because one of
[23:11] the the most important characteristics
[23:13] of money is that it's hard because it
[23:16] holds and stores its value well if the
[23:18] gold Supply can be increased you know
[23:21] you hear some people going into the
[23:22] having Bitcoin is now the hardest money
[23:24] in the world no it was the hardest money
[23:27] in the world from block one because it's
[23:30] just an inflation schedule there were 21
[23:32] million and that's it and that's when it
[23:34] became the hardest money in the world
[23:35] just because the inflation schedule just
[23:37] because the issuance rate is now going
[23:39] lower than the rate that we can pull
[23:41] gold out of the ground doesn't make it a
[23:43] harder money it's always been a harder
[23:45] money from its in from its invention
[23:47] from its Discovery so the price of gold
[23:49] the cost of produ producing gold can go
[23:51] down and the price can come down but
[23:54] what makes Bitcoin so amazing what makes
[23:56] its engineering so marvelous is the
[23:58] relationship between hash rate and
[24:01] difficulty adjustment and as the hash
[24:03] rate goes up that pushes up the
[24:05] difficulty as the difficulty goes up
[24:07] that pushes up the cost to earn as the
[24:09] cost to earn goes up that actually
[24:10] pushes up the floor price because the
[24:12] miners just like gold miners they can't
[24:14] sell you the Bitcoin for less than they
[24:16] mine it and most people who hold Bitcoin
[24:18] sure there there there is a price point
[24:20] that they might let go of it but if
[24:22] you're an OG bitcoiner you buy and you
[24:24] never sell because you know one day
[24:26] there's going to be the right products
[24:27] and services that will allow you to Bor
[24:29] against your Bitcoin and you will never
[24:30] have to sell your Bitcoin so the goal is
[24:33] to buy Bitcoin and never sell it because
[24:35] it's engineered money because of the way
[24:37] it was designed and there's no other
[24:40] money that humans have used previously
[24:42] that is comparable to this design truly
[24:44] Bitcoin is engineered money and our
[24:48] first discovery of a true money that
[24:51] will stand the test of
[24:52] time and uh when we now spin this
[24:56] thought further especially like like
[24:59] medium term of our um of our beings um
[25:05] Bitcoin will basically get rid of all
[25:08] the monetary premiums of real estate of
[25:12] even stocks of uh gold to a certain
[25:15] extent uh um do you agree with that like
[25:19] do you think that real estate will just
[25:21] drastically be really uh repriced gold
[25:24] real drastically be repriced uh stocks
[25:27] real drastically be
[25:30] repriced fantastic question and this is
[25:32] my this is actually my favorite line of
[25:34] study it's called cost structure
[25:36] analysis and what you do as an analyst
[25:39] is you you can do it for a bank or a
[25:41] business it doesn't really matter it's
[25:43] the cost the cost of production is the
[25:45] natural business 101 line because no
[25:48] business can offer a service below its
[25:51] cost it'll go out of business shut down
[25:53] your business and go get a job at least
[25:54] you'll make money you have to sell your
[25:56] products or services for more than it
[25:59] cost you to offer or produce those
[26:00] products or services this is business
[26:02] 101 so what that does for us what that
[26:06] exemplifies for us is that when you have
[26:10] all of these people and they all need a
[26:13] money right we all need a base layer
[26:15] money if we're all chasing that same
[26:18] layer base layer money there's actually
[26:20] two economic rules that are working for
[26:23] us the first Ru is business 101 the
[26:26] difficulty is pushing the cost towards
[26:27] the price as the hash rate increases
[26:29] increasing the fair value of Bitcoin and
[26:32] then the second is the demand for it
[26:34] continues to increase so you get the
[26:36] supply demand equilibrium price pressure
[26:38] a lot of people are don't they don't
[26:40] understand that there are multiple
[26:42] sources of price pressures so when you
[26:44] know when the government says inflation
[26:47] well they're lying because they're just
[26:49] blaming it on the economy but
[26:51] inflation's not from the economy it's
[26:52] from the devaluation of of the currency
[26:55] and all of these all these are designed
[26:59] to deceive you from the truth behind it
[27:02] all which is that Bitcoin is your
[27:05] solution Bitcoin is how you protect and
[27:08] preserve your time and energy and I just
[27:12] I'm not sure what's going to make it
[27:13] click for people but I do think we'll
[27:16] we'll probably see a loss of trust
[27:18] before it actually clicks for people
[27:21] that will be
[27:23] um an amazing time to be alive I think
[27:26] because Humanity will you know they say
[27:29] you don't change Bitcoin Bitcoin changes
[27:30] you so when people are forced to adopt
[27:33] it there might be a rough transition but
[27:35] over time it changes you because it
[27:37] changes your incentive
[27:39] structure yeah it's fascinating uh I
[27:42] talk with so many Bitcoin as I have this
[27:44] go to interview 300 bitcoiners this year
[27:47] alone I probably hit over that like I'm
[27:50] doing every day now so probably I'm
[27:52] going with 350 or something like that um
[27:55] and for me it's like even solving
[27:57] homelessness if the real estate prices
[27:59] is coming down if if the completely
[28:01] premium like there's so much craziness
[28:04] going on with that
[28:06] um I'm sorry I went off on a on a
[28:09] tangent the cost structure analysis the
[28:12] monetary premium of real estate and
[28:14] everything else sorry let me let me dive
[28:16] into
[28:18] this people get this really confused and
[28:21] what's so great about cost structure
[28:23] analysis is that the Baseline is the
[28:26] cost and then the price relative to that
[28:29] Baseline will tell you if it's cheap or
[28:31] expensive so if the price is above the
[28:35] cost it's expensive if the price is
[28:38] below the cost then it's cheap so what's
[28:41] really interesting is when you run cost
[28:43] structure analysis on gold what you'll
[28:46] find out is gold has two prices a
[28:51] commodity price and a monetary price and
[28:55] people get people get they're like what
[28:56] do you mean two prices that doesn't make
[28:57] sense
[28:58] well hear me
[28:59] out the reason that we the way that
[29:03] we'll measure the monetary premium being
[29:06] drained from these assets is as the
[29:08] price gets pushed towards its cost right
[29:11] because the premium pushes the price up
[29:13] above its cost that's the that's the
[29:16] kicker here the higher the price
[29:18] relative to the cost the larger the
[29:20] premium now some of those premiums are
[29:22] created by demand and a lot of those
[29:26] premiums are created by the corupt
[29:29] incentives of the Fiat system so when
[29:31] you look at real estate and you say okay
[29:35] well let's first look at gold right now
[29:37] I think it cost the all-in sustaining
[29:39] cost of gold which by the way the
[29:42] Bitcoin mining Council and Michael saor
[29:44] if you're watching this would you please
[29:46] come out for the good of the industry
[29:48] and investors of the industry and
[29:50] recommend reporting of Allin sustaining
[29:53] cost right we should not only meet the
[29:55] standards set by the gold industry but
[29:57] we should exceed those standards the
[29:59] gold industry the world gold Council
[30:02] recommends reporting of miners of their
[30:04] Allin sustaining cost and that tells us
[30:07] the all-in cost of production of gold
[30:09] well if you look at that cost today it's
[30:10] around 1,800 bucks so gold is trading
[30:13] just a little bit above that just a
[30:15] little bit above 2,000 there's not much
[30:17] premium in Gold relative to its cost so
[30:21] yes there will be some premium drained
[30:23] from gold but there's not so much that
[30:25] can be drained because if you drain too
[30:26] much then the producer won't make any
[30:28] money and then they'll shut down and
[30:30] then the supply will drop and then the
[30:31] price will go even higher until there is
[30:34] a premium that producers can capture and
[30:36] re-enter the market and increase Supply
[30:38] same thing with real estate real estate
[30:41] where are those prices now if you want
[30:42] to know if the real estate you're buying
[30:44] is overpriced or not find out what they
[30:46] call the replacement cost the
[30:47] replacement cost is the cost of
[30:49] production how much is it going to cost
[30:50] me to get this basket of Commodities how
[30:52] much is it going to cost me to get all
[30:53] these laborers to rebuild this home and
[30:56] if you could build a single family home
[30:57] for
[30:59] $250,000 by sourcing all the materials
[31:02] and labor yourself but then you turn
[31:04] around you'd have to buy it for
[31:05] $400,000 well then there's a premium
[31:07] built into that price isn't there
[31:09] because there's a there's quite a bit of
[31:11] a profit margin from the cost of
[31:14] production to the actual market price so
[31:17] sorry I I skipped over that but I wanted
[31:19] to go back into that there's a commodity
[31:21] commodity price and a monetary price and
[31:23] for Bitcoin right now we trade at
[31:25] commodity value because Bitcoin hasn't
[31:27] been monetized so it's still being
[31:29] treated as commoditized energy in the
[31:32] form of money it's still the price
[31:34] Cycles are relative to bitcoin's cost of
[31:36] production and when the price gets too
[31:38] high relative to cost of production
[31:41] those are the Peaks and those and and
[31:43] the smart miners like cleanspark they'll
[31:46] sell their Bitcoin at the Peaks and then
[31:48] when we come back into the discount Zone
[31:50] in the commodity cycle you go from fair
[31:52] value to premium back to fair value to
[31:54] Discount like this up and down that
[31:58] cycle you have to make the right
[32:00] decisions through that cycle so there's
[32:01] no doubt we can see it in the mining
[32:03] companies we can see it in the Cycles
[32:05] themselves Bitcoin trades that commodity
[32:07] value but sometime here in the future
[32:09] when trust is lost Bitcoin will go up
[32:12] its s-curve of adoption and we'll move
[32:14] to monetary value and monetary value is
[32:17] the value prop that's Global GDP divided
[32:19] by 21 million that's where the confusion
[32:21] comes with gold and and Peter Schiff you
[32:24] hear Peter Schiff talking about gold is
[32:26] at all-time highs but the miners are are
[32:29] so far behind the smartest thing you can
[32:31] do is buy the miners because if the
[32:32] price of gold goes up then the miners
[32:34] have to go up too right but Peter you're
[32:36] wrong the cost of producing gold
[32:39] continues to go up because of inflation
[32:41] pressures so the cost of produ to
[32:43] produce the gold and rip it out of the
[32:45] ground and Supply it to the market
[32:46] continues to increase but the price of
[32:48] gold is not increasing as fast therefore
[32:51] the miners of gold are struggling
[32:53] because their profit margins are
[32:54] shrinking so the price of gold can go up
[32:57] and the miners can fail because the
[32:59] price of Gold's not going up as fast as
[33:01] the cost and if we use cost structure
[33:03] analysis for gold or for Real Estate or
[33:05] for anything that you're trying to
[33:07] budget for you can start to answer the
[33:09] question the most important question
[33:11] that any investor can answer which is is
[33:13] what I'm buying cheap or expensive 21
[33:16] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[33:20] they teach and preach self custody this
[33:22] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[33:26] oh where can I buy my bit coin from this
[33:28] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[33:32] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[33:34] time support this podcast use code Robin
[33:37] and click the link in the description
[33:40] it's also fascinating when we talk about
[33:42] cost uh of production of Bitcoin with
[33:45] mining because there is at least right
[33:48] now in the last years I don't know how
[33:50] it was in the early days um no
[33:53] correlation between the mining uh hash
[33:56] rate right now and the price like the
[33:59] the hash rate was at all times highs
[34:00] when we were like really low um how does
[34:02] this play then in the whole whole
[34:05] Theory yeah so there there is no direct
[34:08] correlation it's an indirect correlation
[34:11] that's probably why most people miss it
[34:13] because what happens is as the price
[34:16] goes above the cost that creates profit
[34:18] and what miners do with their profit is
[34:20] they reinvest in hash rate to profit
[34:23] more so there's a lag time between the
[34:26] two so when we move into into the
[34:28] premium phase of the commodity cycle
[34:30] miners should be selling their Bitcoin
[34:32] that they've mined during during the
[34:34] previous bearish phase of the cycle
[34:36] during the discount phase of the cycle
[34:39] and what happens is when they raise
[34:40] those funds they reinvest those funds to
[34:42] expand their operation but when they
[34:44] expand their operation and they increase
[34:47] hash rate there what happens is miners
[34:50] start to find blocks at a faster than a
[34:53] 10-minute pace and the difficulty
[34:55] adjustment is designed to Target 10-
[34:57] minute block times so as the hash rate
[35:00] grows and blocks are found faster than
[35:02] 10 minutes difficulty increases well
[35:05] when difficulty increases the direct
[35:08] effect on the minor is less
[35:10] profitability because when difficulty
[35:12] increases cost moves up but if cost
[35:14] moves up and price doesn't move up your
[35:17] profit margin shrinks so the
[35:19] relationship between hash rate and price
[35:22] is that hash rate drives difficulty
[35:25] difficulty drives cost and cost pushes
[35:28] up the floor price of Bitcoin ultimately
[35:31] towards its monetary value which is
[35:33] global GDP divided by 21 million amazing
[35:37] it's a a great way to look at it and you
[35:39] also call Bitcoin the most pristine uh
[35:42] form of collateral and I love that
[35:46] saying and I have a question for you
[35:48] with when it's collateral you basically
[35:51] would land it out uh for for something
[35:54] would you land out your your Bitcoin
[35:59] no I would never lend out my Bitcoin and
[36:02] I would never advise anyone else to lend
[36:04] out their Bitcoin that is the biggest
[36:07] problem in the marketplace that's so
[36:09] Fiat that's a Fiat mindset that you're
[36:11] going to lend out your Bitcoin to earn
[36:13] Bitcoin break that mindset take
[36:16] everything you've learned in school I
[36:18] learned all the traditional Finance
[36:19] stuff in college I burnt those books in
[36:22] my in my fire pit with my kids so that
[36:24] they wouldn't be brainwashed by it this
[36:27] is some serious stuff that people have
[36:29] to
[36:29] swallow the fact of the matter
[36:32] is is that
[36:35] Bitcoin how do I say this I want to make
[36:37] sure I say this the right
[36:41] way this is this is a sour subject right
[36:44] because you get a lot of these Central
[36:46] Bankers a lot of these uh Wall Street
[36:48] Bros that come over and they're like
[36:50] well we're going to do this and we're
[36:51] going to do this you know you saw
[36:52] Celsius and uh blockfi and Voyager and
[36:56] they thought they were going to
[36:58] they were going to rule the world but
[36:59] they brought these Fiat mindsets into
[37:02] the crypto economy so they they brought
[37:04] the bailout mindset into crypto where
[37:07] there is no bailout there is no mercy
[37:09] and you saw what happened they got
[37:11] destroyed so what needs to happen is
[37:14] people need to understand you will
[37:16] borrow against your Bitcoin that's how
[37:19] empowers you you don't lend it out to
[37:21] earn interest there's no need to you
[37:24] borrow against it and when you borrow
[37:26] against it the equity value we go back
[37:28] to the example I gave you with El
[37:29] Salvador the asset side of your balance
[37:32] sheet is increasing while the liability
[37:34] side of your balance sheet stays the
[37:37] same so therefore the the the um the
[37:42] burden of your liabilities will shrink
[37:45] over time because the asset side of your
[37:47] balance sheet is increasing so let's say
[37:50] you know let's say you you have um like
[37:52] Bitcoin right now is at at um was is it
[37:55] $70,000 or so so let's just call it
[37:58] $100,000 for sake of math so you put up
[38:00] one Bitcoin as collateral you are not
[38:03] lending your Bitcoin to somebody else
[38:05] that is a bad idea that is Fiat what
[38:08] you're doing is you're lending to
[38:10] yourself you're borrowing from your
[38:12] Bitcoin to yourself so you put up one
[38:14] Bitcoin for $100,000 you borrow $40,000
[38:17] against it here's the risk if the price
[38:20] goes from $100,000 down to like 42,000
[38:22] you're going to get
[38:24] liquidated that's what you're going to
[38:25] lose your Bitcoin that's that's a
[38:28] potential thing but we have to look at
[38:31] this from the borrower side and from the
[38:34] lender side that's what people forget
[38:36] they always think they always think
[38:37] about the borrowers because most people
[38:39] are borrowers and very few people are
[38:41] lenders but from the lender side when
[38:44] someone posts that Bitcoin collateral
[38:47] it's an over collateralized loan and
[38:49] what that means is that there's no
[38:51] default risk so it's not based on my
[38:53] promise right if I posted one Bitcoin
[38:55] collateral with you and then you lent me
[38:59] $40,000 if I walked away from you and
[39:02] never came back you wouldn't care you
[39:04] wouldn't care at all because you hold
[39:06] that one Bitcoin uh as collateral and if
[39:08] the terms of our contract expire they
[39:10] may be they I think they'll end up being
[39:13] Perpetual but let's just say it did
[39:15] expire what you would do is you would
[39:16] sell that bit if I never came back to
[39:18] pay you back the 40,000 plus interest
[39:21] you would sell the 40,000 plus interest
[39:23] from the Bitcoin and then when I did
[39:25] come back to you the remainder of my
[39:26] Bitcoin would be sitting in my account
[39:29] and there was no risk to the lender
[39:31] because it was an over collateralized
[39:33] loan now let's go back to the borrower
[39:35] side and I I wanted to interject the the
[39:37] lender side because it's important for
[39:39] people to understand right now from the
[39:42] lender side what they consider the most
[39:45] pristine form of collateral is us
[39:46] treasuries and and you know us
[39:49] treasuries have worked fantastic and
[39:51] they solved the problems that gold had
[39:53] gold was too expensive to secure and to
[39:56] transport and to settle it didn't make
[39:58] sense to settle gold sometimes you would
[40:00] have you would pay more to transport the
[40:02] gold to settle than you would in
[40:03] interest against the loan so it doesn't
[40:05] make sense uh gold didn't work as a base
[40:08] layer money that could be used as
[40:10] collateral within a financial system so
[40:13] they fixed that problem with us
[40:15] treasuries but the assumption that they
[40:17] made was that the the expansion of
[40:20] supply of those treasuries would never
[40:21] be a problem that's where treasuries are
[40:24] failing now so treasuries are fantastic
[40:26] because you can settle treasuries
[40:29] cheaply securely and
[40:31] easily uh but there's a problem we lost
[40:34] the hardness of the gold collateral
[40:36] right gold was so good because you
[40:38] couldn't expand it well look what the
[40:39] governments are doing to expand treasury
[40:41] debt all over the world it's too soft so
[40:45] Bitcoin comes in and it's a hybrid you
[40:47] get the best of gold and you get the
[40:48] best of us treasuries Bitcoin is that
[40:51] engineered money that was that can do
[40:53] what gold and us treasuries could never
[40:55] do deliver you the hardness but also the
[40:58] fast cheap and easy and secure
[41:00] settlement now we come back to the
[41:02] borrower the borrower why would I want
[41:04] to borrow $440,000 against my $100,000
[41:06] of Bitcoin well because what what you're
[41:10] the risk that you're taking like we
[41:11] talked about was the liquidation risk
[41:13] but let's just say things become more
[41:15] steady and we're starting to move up the
[41:16] S curve and you know these 60 70%
[41:19] downturns now turn into 30 and 40%
[41:22] downturns right so at a 40% LTV you got
[41:25] 60% of wiggle room
[41:27] plus you can actually deposit more
[41:29] margin if you if you if you wanted to if
[41:31] you wanted to take the additional risk
[41:32] of losing more Bitcoin but the what
[41:35] comes to fact is that you borrowed 40
[41:37] Grand and let's say you borrowed 40,000
[41:39] at
[41:40] 5% well the rate of inflation is 10% and
[41:44] the the compounding annual growth rate
[41:46] of Bitcoin over the last 10 years is 60%
[41:50] so let's just cut that in half and say
[41:52] that it's only 30% kager well you got
[41:55] 30% kager working for you on the upside
[41:58] and you only have a 5% liability working
[42:00] for you on the downside that's called a
[42:03] self-re loan Bitcoin will enable
[42:06] self-repairing loans and people just
[42:08] haven't discovered it yet because they
[42:10] they're still trying to figure out how
[42:12] can we lend out our Bitcoin and make
[42:13] money you don't lend out your Bitcoin to
[42:15] make money you borrow against your
[42:17] Bitcoin to make money that's the big
[42:20] thing that's the light bulb that has to
[42:22] go off and I think uh there's a couple
[42:24] of people working on that but me
[42:25] personally at people's Reserve we've
[42:27] been stealth building for two years and
[42:29] one of our mainstream products is a
[42:31] self-repairing mortgage powered by
[42:33] Bitcoin and it Embraces the new mindset
[42:36] of Bitcoin as pristine collateral that
[42:38] empowers you as the barterer and reduces
[42:41] risk to lender it's a hybrid model that
[42:43] I think is going to take the World by
[42:46] storm yeah definitely and it's
[42:48] it's it's it's so fascinating to see
[42:51] what possibilities bitcoiners and
[42:53] Bitcoin uh will have in the in the
[42:56] future and what I also wonder uh what
[42:59] are Al coins doing
[43:01] here is it is it is it just noise uh is
[43:05] it just gambling is it just uh something
[43:08] that came up because Bitcoin had
[43:10] something like it's it's I always
[43:12] compared a little bit with the.com
[43:15] bubble like the really good companies
[43:17] made it through and like 99% of the
[43:20] companies were were washed out how do
[43:23] you look at
[43:24] altcoins yeah I think maybe that's being
[43:26] a little little bit too nice to some of
[43:28] these shitcoin scams I think the OG
[43:31] mindset is
[43:34] um Bitcoin is money it's the perfect
[43:38] form of money it's an engineered money
[43:40] it was designed to Leverage The Natural
[43:43] laws of economics and commodity cycles
[43:46] and price Discovery to empower We the
[43:48] People nothing can compete with Bitcoin
[43:51] and if you think something can compete
[43:52] with Bitcoin something's wrong with you
[43:54] you need to study more you haven't
[43:55] figured it out yet so if there's any
[43:57] coin or any project out there that says
[43:59] we're competing with Bitcoin you
[44:02] shouldn't get near it with a thousand
[44:03] foot pole because it's a scam it there's
[44:05] no reason for it to exist we already
[44:08] have perfect money it's Bitcoin if you
[44:11] can Embrace that mindset Bitcoin is the
[44:14] perfect wheel now what are some of these
[44:17] other coins out here doing well when I
[44:21] first invested in ethereum it was not
[44:24] sold to me as hard money it was the the
[44:26] IDE behind ethereum was smart contract
[44:29] capability hey you're going to be able
[44:31] to manage your money and with smart
[44:34] contracts and you're going to need gas
[44:36] to execute those smart contracts that's
[44:39] the real reason that anybody who loved
[44:41] Bitcoin even dip their toes in that
[44:43] ethereum Ico because oh my gosh talking
[44:46] about different ways to manage my
[44:49] Bitcoin with smart contracts and I need
[44:51] gas to execute some of these contracts
[44:53] it could be an options contract it could
[44:55] be like a discret log contract contract
[44:57] that's on bitcoin any type of
[44:59] contractual agreement and I'm going to
[45:01] need gas to execute it and I want to
[45:03] build contractual agreements based on my
[45:06] money so now you see ether coming out
[45:09] here and talking about hard we're hard
[45:10] money too you guys are fools you're
[45:13] going up against a quantum computer
[45:15] Ledger that is Bitcoin proof of work you
[45:17] have no chance you switch from proof of
[45:18] work to proof of stake game's over where
[45:21] my interest lie is Bitcoin is that prein
[45:25] wheel where's the cart that I can
[45:27] connect to the wheel to make me
[45:29] productive right because if I have a
[45:31] wheel that's fantastic but if I connect
[45:33] a cart to the wheel now I can start to
[45:36] do work and that's really important
[45:39] concept that I think some OG bitcoiners
[45:41] need to kind of understand and I and
[45:44] I'll I'll give an example I think Stacks
[45:47] I've been telling my followers about
[45:48] Stacks since the bare Market lows of
[45:51] sub2 cents and I think now we're up to
[45:53] like
[45:55] $3.7 I have never experienced anything
[45:58] like I have with ethereum from under a
[46:01] dollar to where it went to Stacks is the
[46:04] first thing I think that has that type
[46:06] of growth potential because it's
[46:08] everything ethereum was supposed to be
[46:10] and the real Innovation behind Stacks is
[46:12] that it's not some other coin what makes
[46:14] Bitcoin Bitcoin was proof of work it's
[46:18] the proof of work algorithm that makes
[46:19] Bitcoin Bitcoin that's why e ether
[46:21] that's why ether was proof of work
[46:23] because the value was in the proof of
[46:25] work algorithm but we just need to prove
[46:27] of work with smart contracts but what
[46:30] they did at Stacks was they evolved and
[46:34] what happened is we we hear of this
[46:36] proof of transfer algorithm now you
[46:38] don't hear anybody in the space talking
[46:39] about proof of transfer because they
[46:41] just don't know about it yet but they
[46:43] will know it it'll be a household name
[46:45] because really proof of transfer
[46:47] leverages proof of work and there's no
[46:50] need for any other type of structure
[46:52] dags all this other that these
[46:55] shitcoins try to sell on why they're
[46:57] better we don't need it we only need
[46:59] proof of transfer because proof of
[47:01] transfer leverages the network security
[47:04] of proof of work for the proof of
[47:06] transfer chain and then furthermore the
[47:10] way it works with Stacks blocks is the
[47:13] miners have to bid Bitcoin to earn the
[47:15] stacks block and then what happens is
[47:17] the minor who wins the stacks block the
[47:20] Bitcoin that was bid on the Block gets
[47:22] distributed to the stackers and then the
[47:24] minor who won the block gets his portion
[47:26] of that bit coin distribution but then
[47:28] also a stack reward what that does is
[47:31] and this is huge people need to
[47:32] understand this there's only four ways
[47:35] to buy Bitcoin in the world one labor
[47:38] for it two mine it three Market buy it
[47:43] four stack Stacks what that does is it
[47:48] makes the fundamental value of stacks a
[47:50] derivative of Bitcoin value because now
[47:53] I can buy Stacks to earn Bitcoin that's
[47:56] that's what proof of transfer does
[47:58] that's how proof of transfer leverages
[48:01] the Bitcoin quantum computer Ledger
[48:03] Network to empower itself this is so far
[48:06] beyond ethereum or any other L1 out
[48:09] there where you have to go to do all
[48:10] this bridging stuff I I I truly believe
[48:14] that the only reason for these altcoins
[48:16] to exist is to complement Bitcoin and
[48:19] there's no other ecosystem on my radar
[48:22] that complements Bitcoin the way Stacks
[48:24] does because without Bitcoin stack
[48:27] couldn't exist without Bitcoin could
[48:29] some of these other chains exist
[48:31] absolutely matter of fact without
[48:33] Bitcoin they probably claim they were
[48:34] money and try to compete for the market
[48:37] but Stacks it can't exist without
[48:39] Bitcoin they're it's a complimentary
[48:43] L2 that is the cart to the Bitcoin wheel
[48:46] that makes Bitcoin evolve from digital
[48:49] gold to digital collateral from a 122
[48:52] trillion do store value market to a 100
[48:55] plus trillion doll money
[48:58] Market it's always FAS fascinating for
[49:01] me when it comes to Layer Two because I
[49:05] have to do so much more research work on
[49:07] that first of all uh like you have to
[49:10] admit where you just have a blind spot
[49:13] uh because for me it's the pristine
[49:15] collateral it's it's the it's it it's
[49:18] Bitcoin the layer one it's so great it's
[49:21] such a beautiful uh invention it's such
[49:23] an amazing Tool uh technology that we
[49:26] have
[49:27] and I'm sure there's a lot of Technology
[49:30] will be built on top of that will be
[49:32] done with that but the important thing
[49:34] is that we have Bitcoin as the base
[49:36] layer and then the free market will
[49:38] decide what is on there there like fedy
[49:40] Min there's liquid there's Stacks
[49:42] there's lightning there's there's a lot
[49:44] going on and I just cannot foresee um I
[49:49] I don't have to for Sid to say this is
[49:52] the future that's is the future do you
[49:54] see uh value in the other layer tools
[49:57] like lightning for example fedt what do
[50:00] you see uh besides Stacks yeah oh yeah
[50:03] absolutely I see value in lightning I
[50:05] think lightning is is about monetary
[50:07] velocity right lightning is about
[50:09] enabling you to spend your Bitcoin for
[50:11] coffee for micro payments and that's
[50:13] important because that's that plays a
[50:15] role in the medium of exchange function
[50:18] but the medium of exchange function is
[50:21] limited relative to the store value and
[50:24] Global base layer equity
[50:27] money so you know medium of exchange
[50:29] might be a few trillion um but Bas layer
[50:33] Equity is probably close to a
[50:35] quadrillion with the amount of money
[50:37] that's been printed thus far so you're
[50:39] talking about a multiple of 100x
[50:42] relative
[50:44] and yeah lightning is valuable because
[50:47] it's there to increase monetary velocity
[50:49] that's a good that's a solution to a
[50:51] problem Stacks can solve that solution
[50:54] as well but what's more important
[50:56] important is that it offers smart
[50:58] contract capability in a in a in a
[51:01] decentralized way and I do think that
[51:03] you're right the free market is going to
[51:05] decide and that's why people's Reserve
[51:07] is a centralized company we believe that
[51:09] not everybody in the world wants to
[51:11] exist in a world where computers Des
[51:13] decide everything and everything is
[51:15] decentralized and you never interact
[51:17] with another human being if you want to
[51:18] borrow against your Bitcoin come into my
[51:21] building shake my hand look me in the
[51:22] eye I want to know who you are I'm
[51:24] lending you money and you're borrowing
[51:26] money from me let's develop a
[51:28] relationship I think there's still going
[51:30] to be you know we're not going into this
[51:31] like technocracy where humans won't
[51:34] interact anymore and some humans will
[51:36] prefer those decentralized no
[51:38] interaction Solutions and sometimes
[51:41] those Solutions will be more efficient
[51:43] but the market is so large we're talking
[51:45] about multi hundred trillion dollar
[51:46] Marketplace look at all the central
[51:48] banks in the world not even not even one
[51:50] Central Bank can handle handle it all
[51:52] right there's so many uh different
[51:54] branches of the of there's the bank of
[51:56] inter settlement international monetary
[51:58] fund each country has a central bank and
[52:00] then branches of those central banks
[52:02] within the country there's so much
[52:04] volume in in base layer money that no
[52:07] one company no one solution is going to
[52:10] be able to handle it so we just need to
[52:12] make sure that those Solutions are built
[52:16] and ran by true OG bitcoiners who
[52:19] understand that Bitcoin is money and the
[52:21] things that are being built are not
[52:22] being built to compete with it but to
[52:24] complement it
[52:27] it's fascinating for me also to see uh
[52:29] that
[52:30] bitcoiners and Bitcoin is a digital
[52:32] money um that bitcoiners are so down to
[52:35] earth so nature loving so um they want
[52:39] the connection with human beings it's
[52:42] it's kind of the feat world is that like
[52:44] oh I'm isolating myself I I want to be
[52:46] in this in this screen world and I want
[52:48] to be only it's it's the the bitcoiners
[52:51] are those who buys the farm and lives
[52:54] somewhere the subbs
[52:56] so that's that's fascinating for me to
[52:58] see and this I think the podcast when
[53:00] you go back and see the the interviews
[53:02] you see a lot of those Personalities in
[53:04] there um for the end of the podcast you
[53:08] think about it oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I
[53:10] just want to interject one thing because
[53:11] I want to that's so important what you
[53:13] said about I very few bitcoiners that
[53:16] I've met are closed they're very open
[53:20] they're very honest they love Justice
[53:22] they love truth and if you think about
[53:24] it you know if we move into a future
[53:26] and we're on a Bitcoin standard then
[53:29] let's say a farmer has to come to your
[53:32] come to your company and wants to borrow
[53:33] against their corn or borrow against
[53:36] maybe even their Bitcoin treasury well
[53:38] what happens if the the liquidation
[53:42] price goes what if the price goes below
[53:43] their liquidation Mark are you just
[53:45] going to be a decentralized app and just
[53:47] Boop you're liquidated too bad
[53:48] everything that you worked for for your
[53:50] whole life is gone or would you rather
[53:51] have a relationship with who you're
[53:54] borrowing from who you're banking with
[53:55] to be able to call and say Hey listen I
[53:57] can't post this margin today but in two
[54:00] months my crop is going to be sold and I
[54:03] have contracts so I know I'll be able to
[54:05] post that margin will you work with me
[54:07] and that you know there it creates a
[54:09] relationship besides just a zero and a
[54:12] one right the the decentralized network
[54:14] is a zero and a one and there's nothing
[54:15] wrong with it and a lot of times it's
[54:17] going to be more efficient but there are
[54:18] going to be important things in our
[54:20] society like farmers and engineering and
[54:22] town building and Citadel building that
[54:25] where if don't go as planned you want to
[54:27] be able to shake a hand with somebody
[54:29] you want to be able to have some type of
[54:32] solution besides the zero and the one
[54:34] and who better to work with than fellow
[54:36] bitcoiners yeah and I think this this
[54:39] what you also touched on bitcoiners are
[54:41] open uh we talked about it right before
[54:44] the podcast that I don't send out
[54:47] questions or something like that and you
[54:48] don't demand questions and I have now my
[54:51] 81st podcast and I think I have two
[54:54] podcasts uh on of free podcasts that
[54:58] wanted to have questions but they were
[55:00] like just okay with the questions like
[55:01] oh okay perfect uh and so even like from
[55:05] from 81 to wanted questions and the rest
[55:09] not because they're just so open they
[55:10] like they like ask me anything if you
[55:13] have a bad question I will tell you so
[55:14] and and this is this is the culture and
[55:16] the community uh that's that's amazing
[55:19] it's just a by product of an amazing
[55:21] monetary asset that attracts amazing
[55:24] people and this is uh I'm I'm glad to be
[55:26] be in this community and that I found
[55:28] found that uh yeah great well said
[55:31] couldn't agree more well said and uh
[55:34] before we come to the end of the podcast
[55:37] I have one more question I'm really
[55:39] interested in in your opinion on that um
[55:41] do what are you now currently
[55:44] researching like I think people always
[55:46] have like this this in their life like a
[55:48] learning fa different learning phase and
[55:50] they're like always researching
[55:51] something depending on where they are in
[55:53] their life what are you now and it
[55:55] doesn't have to be about Bitcoin it can
[55:57] be about Bitcoin what are you now
[55:59] researching deeply what are you now
[56:01] learning
[56:03] new yeah great question and you're right
[56:05] because once bitcoiners get down that
[56:07] rabbit hole you people are like have you
[56:09] gone down the rabbit hole I'm like
[56:11] brother I've gone to the bottom of the
[56:12] rabbit hole I've planted some dynamite
[56:14] and I've dug a little deeper okay we've
[56:17] gone deep on this so I love that
[56:19] question and right now what I'm what I'm
[56:22] studying is relative to what I'm
[56:24] building so at people's Reserve we are
[56:26] building that hybrid debt-based Bitcoin
[56:29] commodity credit market with the goal of
[56:32] letting the free market redefine the
[56:35] risk-free rate right now the risk-free
[56:38] rate is based on us treasuries because
[56:41] if you have a US Treasury you're going
[56:43] to get your money they have a printer so
[56:45] they're just going to print it and pay
[56:46] it to you but what people are learning
[56:48] is uh oh risk-free doesn't mean
[56:51] risk-free because when they print the
[56:53] money and pay it to me I don't know what
[56:54] I'm going to be able to buy there's
[56:56] inflation risk there so what what I'm
[56:59] studying is the the the thought process
[57:03] behind what defines risk-free in the
[57:06] financial markets and you heard me say
[57:08] earlier Bitcoin is the risk-free rate of
[57:10] energy for energy producers what people
[57:13] don't realize is when an energy producer
[57:15] comes in and builds a
[57:17] plant sometimes there's not enough
[57:19] demand for that energy so they're able
[57:22] to produce a capacity Beyond they in
[57:25] other words they can produce a supply
[57:27] that is larger than demand and what you
[57:29] can do with Bitcoin is you can come in
[57:31] and you can capture that extra Supply
[57:33] instead of it having being wasted and as
[57:36] an energy producer there's no profit
[57:38] there that's a cost because you're still
[57:39] producing the energy at a cost with land
[57:42] labor and everything else well Bitcoin
[57:45] becomes the risk-free rate of energy
[57:47] because if you're if you got um you know
[57:50] 10 gaws power and you can only sell five
[57:52] of it what do you do with the other five
[57:54] traditionally it gets wasted Bitcoin
[57:56] comes in and now becomes the risk-free
[57:58] rate it increases the bottom line of
[58:00] your your operation of your business by
[58:03] capturing that wasted energy so it
[58:05] becomes the risk-free rate of energy
[58:08] well Bitcoin is not just going to be the
[58:09] risk-free rate of energy it's going to
[58:11] be the risk free rate of return meaning
[58:14] that the commodity credit Market that
[58:17] people's Reserve is pioneering will
[58:19] offer the marketplace an opportunity to
[58:22] put the price on money right if these
[58:24] Central Bankers they can't tell us the
[58:25] price of eggs or milk or chicken and we
[58:29] say well let the free market signal us
[58:32] what the price is right it should be
[58:33] based on the supply demand equilibrium
[58:35] let the free market work it out then why
[58:38] in the world can they tell us the price
[58:39] of money there's no difference between
[58:41] the price of money and the price of milk
[58:43] it should be based on the supply demand
[58:45] equilibrium when the supply of money is
[58:46] high and the demand is low interest
[58:48] rates drop when the supply of money is
[58:51] low and the demand is high interest
[58:52] rates rise should be a free market price
[58:55] equilibrium just like everything else
[58:57] should not be based on what a group of
[59:00] men dictate that price to be and Bitcoin
[59:03] is giving us the opportunity to redefine
[59:06] the risk-free rate by allowing the free
[59:08] market to set the real price of money
[59:11] and that's what I've been studying
[59:12] recently with building people's Reserve
[59:15] really really cool and we having an end
[59:17] routine in the podcast where the
[59:19] previous guest is asking a question for
[59:21] the next guest um sometimes it's a
[59:23] really good question uh sometimes it's a
[59:25] question that just does not fit because
[59:28] you have kids and it's it's just not
[59:30] fitting if you already have kids uh but
[59:33] I will read the question anyways to you
[59:35] and you can do with the question
[59:36] whatever you want to do with it uh will
[59:39] the name of your first Bor be Bitcoin
[59:43] related I I actually I have three kids
[59:47] and
[59:48] um all Bible names that's everything
[59:52] comes down in the Bible names for me so
[59:54] when I talk to people I either talk
[59:56] Bible or I talk Bitcoin and I don't
[59:57] really talk anything else you know
[59:59] people come up to me like hey did you
[60:00] see that game last night uh no I didn't
[60:02] watch a bunch of dudes run around on a
[60:04] field grabbing each other uh I've been
[60:06] busy I've been busy building the future
[60:09] um but yeah I'm glad you I'm I'm glad
[60:11] you saw that match guy um
[60:13] so I that's interesting question maybe
[60:16] if we have another one we might throw
[60:18] something in a middle name but
[60:20] definitely the Bible takes precedent for
[60:22] us we name all our kids from the Bible
[60:24] yeah that's great I had with Pastor coin
[60:27] I think three or four episodes agoo the
[60:30] whole topic Bitcoin Bible Christianity
[60:33] everything uh it's it's it's it's a
[60:36] great topic and a deep topic also also
[60:38] the connection between Christianity
[60:40] religion and Bitcoin uh but we are
[60:43] already over the one hour mark I will
[60:45] not open this topic now maybe we can do
[60:46] it in episode and in a round two um
[60:50] thank you so much uh for for joining me
[60:52] today it it was a pleasure talking with
[60:54] you um for people that want to ask you
