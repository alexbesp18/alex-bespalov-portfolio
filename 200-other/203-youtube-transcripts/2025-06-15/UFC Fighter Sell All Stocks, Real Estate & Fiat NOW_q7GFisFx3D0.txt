[00:00] Bitcoin will drive no matter what I
[00:02] didn't sell I never sold any Bitcoin I
[00:04] used to care about nice things I always
[00:07] used to buy some Rolexes and then I to
[00:10] say [ __ ] that I will buy some Bitcoin
[00:12] with that money I want to leave of my
[00:14] labor I want to make money and I want to
[00:16] invest money in a good and hard and
[00:19] sound asset like Bitcoin the financial
[00:21] system right now is in a bringer of a
[00:23] collapse I don't know how we going to
[00:25] pay the debbit if every year the United
[00:27] States the debbit is growing bigger and
[00:30] bigger and that's the best country in
[00:31] the world the biggest economy in the
[00:33] world if you look all economy they are
[00:35] even worse why would you finance the
[00:37] government if you're buying stocks
[00:39] you're financing the government Bitcoin
[00:41] is just a way to get out of the system
[00:43] that you don't agree on the next couple
[00:45] years I want to put everything on
[00:47] bitcoin don't trust in politicians even
[00:49] if you like them the system going to do
[00:51] what is beneficial for the system if you
[00:53] worth to lie and to say stuff so so the
[00:55] people can vote you they're going to do
[00:57] that
[00:59] [Music]
[01:02] for those two people in the audience
[01:04] that might not know you um who are you
[01:07] what are you doing and and what got you
[01:09] inspired to get into Bitcoin uh my name
[01:12] is H moano I am a UFC fighter a current
[01:15] UFC figh and I start to to buy Bitcoin
[01:20] because I want money right I was I I was
[01:23] trying to to make some money and and at
[01:27] the time I had to start invest on stocks
[01:30] and stuff like that I had moved to the
[01:32] US and then I think
[01:36] 2021 right after the Hing the 2020
[01:39] Bitcoin Spike up I don't know how how
[01:41] many times and then everybody on the
[01:43] jeans start to talk about Bitcoin and I
[01:45] say okay I want to I want to learn about
[01:47] that too and then I I bought some but
[01:50] not for the right reasons right I bought
[01:52] to I bought to like to get rich and to
[01:57] and I didn't understand at the time and
[01:59] then
[02:00] uh the price dropped right the price
[02:02] dropped and everybody was saying this
[02:04] was a a scheme a pyramid scheme and and
[02:07] this and that and then uh uh I didn't
[02:10] sell I never I never sold any Bitcoin
[02:13] but I was not buying couple years later
[02:17] like one or two years later I start to
[02:19] really uh go into Bitcoin and I read
[02:22] some books and then I I realize Bitcoin
[02:25] is something that is is way more than
[02:28] money right is a about uh pre time
[02:32] preference is about is about uh saving
[02:36] your money is about protect yourself by
[02:39] of the inflation so but to to to to be
[02:43] honest with you I went I start to buy
[02:45] Bitcoin to get rich and then I
[02:48] understand the purpose of the Bitcoin
[02:50] interesting the time preference thing is
[02:53] interesting did it change something for
[02:55] you that it had an impact on on your
[02:57] time preference or is it just like ass
[03:00] said for you no it did because right now
[03:04] I used to care about like nice things
[03:07] and I I I always used to buy some
[03:11] Rolexes and stuff and chains and I say
[03:14] [ __ ] that I will buy some Bitcoin with
[03:16] that money because uh because I'm sorry
[03:20] s I'm so sorry my son is over here uh oh
[03:23] no worries no wor
[03:25] yeah so so I think really change your
[03:28] mind when you start to when realize that
[03:30] fear currency is all the time the base
[03:33] and like we Lo we losing power you just
[03:36] start to buy stuff to to to try
[03:39] to to try to maintain your money and
[03:42] even with stuff like Rolex because
[03:44] everybody say n the price goes up but
[03:46] the price goes up because the money
[03:48] doesn't doesn't have value you know so
[03:51] when I start to realize that I start to
[03:53] invest more on on things like uh not
[03:57] only Bitcoin but family family time and
[04:00] uh things that get me better reading
[04:03] more books so I think Bitcoin changed my
[04:05] mind completely interesting how is it
[04:07] actually as a UFC fight because I think
[04:10] like you probably get little money in
[04:12] the starting and then you get more more
[04:15] the the more fights you have and the
[04:17] more famous and stuff like that you you
[04:18] get um and then at some point like you
[04:21] reach a point where you probably don't
[04:23] want to fight anymore uh and and want to
[04:26] retire it's it's it's almost like like
[04:29] all profession Prof athletes go through
[04:31] that phase where they have like Prime
[04:32] Time where they earn the most money uh
[04:36] where I think a lot of the um where
[04:39] where it's dangerous to spend it all and
[04:41] then don't have any income and no no
[04:43] money when you're like later in the
[04:45] stage what is the the challenge there
[04:47] how how did you uh uh uh how did you go
[04:51] through that of like not having a much
[04:54] money and then like earning more more
[04:55] with the UFC and then like trying to
[04:58] save that and invest
[05:00] and plan for retirement for yourself I
[05:03] think I think like MMA is very funny
[05:07] because like I was saying the other
[05:09] day it it's like the free market you
[05:12] know you don't have any guarantees you
[05:14] know uh if you if you fight somebody
[05:16] that's is really good they're gonna pay
[05:18] you more because it's more risk it's
[05:20] like a risk reward thing you know on the
[05:23] beginning you don't make any money on my
[05:25] first couple fights I even had I didn't
[05:28] even get paid you know I was fighting
[05:30] for free I was fighting to get my name
[05:33] out there and then when I got to UFC I
[05:35] start to make a little money and then
[05:37] you make a little money with
[05:38] sponsorships and stuff but soon as you
[05:40] have like a audience people start to
[05:42] follow you you make more money and but
[05:45] the problem is uh I'm from Brazil and I
[05:49] don't know if you know how Brazil is
[05:50] politically but Brazil is very very
[05:53] socialist even though we are we still
[05:55] are a democracy even though we still
[05:57] elect our presidencies and and but but
[06:01] the mind you know the constitution of
[06:04] Brazil was made in 1988 so it's very
[06:08] very young and and you have to realize
[06:10] that the constitution was made before
[06:13] the fall of the the the so Soviet Union
[06:17] so on the Constitutions on the
[06:20] constitution of Brazil we have stuff
[06:22] saying that like people have the right
[06:25] to have homes on the Constitution people
[06:27] have the right to have like wealthcare
[06:29] this is in the Constitution so this
[06:32] welfare is like a it's like a uh a a
[06:39] thing that is our constitution so that's
[06:42] why our money doesn't doesn't have value
[06:45] you know and as a and as a Brazilian we
[06:47] don't talk about money so growing up I
[06:49] didn't know what what money was nobody
[06:52] talk about money everybody wants to be
[06:55] in the government side so once I move to
[06:57] America I start to realize about money
[07:00] and then I start to realize that man one
[07:02] day I'm I will not be making that much
[07:05] money that I'm doing now so I have to
[07:07] invest I have to take care of my family
[07:09] after I'm done and then I start to try
[07:12] to understand about money I got into
[07:14] Bitcoin and after Bitcoin I start to
[07:17] read books like um Bitcoin Bitcoin
[07:20] standard and after that couple Austrian
[07:23] books of money lud vomes and muray RBA
[07:26] all that all that kind of aors and I and
[07:29] I start start to realize what what money
[07:31] is and the importance of savings right
[07:34] because that there is this whole debate
[07:36] about uh savings and Credit and I think
[07:40] that was what inspired Bitcoin too so uh
[07:44] my mind right now is is very focused on
[07:48] make money save money invest money and
[07:51] and use my time at best to be with my
[07:54] family that's what I think and that's
[07:56] what I believe that like a true Bitcoin
[07:58] I love that really cool
[08:00] uh also inflation I think in Brazil
[08:02] inflation is a huge topic uh so it's
[08:05] like they have huge inflation but you
[08:08] don't talk about money it's it's the
[08:09] Money Talks was more than coming in in
[08:11] America and in Brazil there was no no
[08:14] money talk that's interesting I like
[08:16] that no not not at all not at all like
[08:19] uh it's even funny because I remember
[08:21] one day I was a kid and I asked how much
[08:23] money my my father was making and he
[08:26] said hey don't say that you don't ask
[08:28] people that kind of question even your
[08:30] parents even even if is your uncle or
[08:33] myself you don't talk about
[08:34] money in Brazil they treat money as
[08:38] almost something that is wrong you know
[08:40] like if you're rich is because you rob
[08:42] somebody or because you're a bad person
[08:45] they don't see M money as this tool
[08:48] because money is just a tool to cons to
[08:50] to for you to reserve value right it's
[08:53] just you just you just storing you just
[08:57] it's just a it's just a technology to to
[08:59] store your your work it's only that it's
[09:02] only that but people see this money as
[09:05] this magical stuff right but in
[09:09] reality money is just a way to saving
[09:12] your your work to saving what you you
[09:15] making and I got like I say I got in
[09:18] Bitcoin through to like to Greed but
[09:22] then I understand like the philosophy
[09:24] and and then I I just want to talk about
[09:27] Bitcoin I just want to talk about
[09:28] economics
[09:30] interesting was was Bitcoin a moment for
[09:32] you where you learned about money and
[09:34] inflation all that stuff or did you know
[09:36] a little bit about that beforehand no uh
[09:39] like the inflation and all that stuff I
[09:42] think even if you don't know the causes
[09:44] you know that you if you if you keep
[09:47] money on the bank you're going to lose
[09:49] the other day I I was asking a friend
[09:51] that is a fighter and I and I asked him
[09:53] do you do you leave your money on the
[09:54] bank and say hell no because it's it's
[09:58] going to uh it's going to be the bankk
[10:01] right it's going to be the base and and
[10:04] and I say and why is that but they don't
[10:06] know they think inflation is just thing
[10:08] that happens with money it's just a
[10:10] regular thing but then you have to and
[10:12] then I try to teach him they say man we
[10:16] only have inflation because because
[10:19] government are printing money you know
[10:21] they are they are increasing the supply
[10:23] of money and then uh your money lose the
[10:27] value you but back in the day I was the
[10:30] same I knew that if I if I put my money
[10:33] on the bank if I was not investing my
[10:35] money I would be losing but I didn't
[10:37] know why and and that's why people are
[10:41] putting money on the most uh trashy
[10:45] stuff you know they put on Bing they
[10:47] they put on stocks that don't make any
[10:48] money they put on bonds they put in in
[10:50] every place because they know
[10:52] instinctively that they're going to lose
[10:54] if they let the money stop you know and
[10:58] I know I I knew about that but I didn't
[11:00] know what causes like and the causes are
[11:03] central banks governments and inflation
[11:06] and quantitative easing all that stuff
[11:08] that the people from Bitcoin loves to
[11:10] talk about absolutely and is is it uh
[11:14] with within your colleagues with your
[11:15] teams with your with your peers is is
[11:18] that now where you were the bitcoiner
[11:21] that kind of educated them or is that
[11:24] well known uh of how to deal with money
[11:27] and and this Bitcoin thing or it came or
[11:30] did it came with with you basically I I
[11:33] try to I try to to teach everybody I try
[11:36] my best but some people think I'm just
[11:38] annoying you know because H look him
[11:40] he's just talking about that [ __ ] again
[11:42] they don't want to talk about that
[11:43] because it's very hard to to to talk
[11:46] about Bitcoin and economy and not talk
[11:48] about politics too because politics they
[11:51] the they have a huge influence on the on
[11:54] the economy so people don't want to be
[11:57] too political about that and people
[11:59] don't want to talk about that but every
[12:01] time that I can I'm trying to teach like
[12:03] and say man you have to put your your
[12:05] money in an asset that not gonna lose
[12:08] value not goingon to lose to inflation
[12:10] that that is safe and secure if you know
[12:12] how to do your self custody and and I'm
[12:15] trying always to spread the word thing I
[12:19] don't want to talk too much about
[12:20] politics but I think it's interesting
[12:22] that Bitcoin is so much into politics
[12:24] now like Trump is mentioning it um we
[12:27] have so many the Senators that into this
[12:30] uh political uh forces around the world
[12:33] actually is are now mentioning and
[12:36] debating Bitcoin which is H kind of
[12:38] unbelievable for me to see because since
[12:41] five years into Bitcoin and this five
[12:42] years ago was like nothing there and now
[12:45] they're talking about it how do you see
[12:47] that currently with the us maybe having
[12:50] a strategic Bitcoin reserve and they
[12:52] moving in how do you like that
[12:55] politicians are moving into Bitcoin and
[12:57] the us maybe uh
[12:59] steam rolling ahead I don't know I think
[13:02] Trump sent the wrong message right on
[13:04] the last few weeks because I thought
[13:07] because he went to Nashville right to
[13:09] the Bitcoin conference and he said that
[13:10] he would pardon Ross Zuri and he would
[13:14] on the first day and he would like a uh
[13:18] not sell the Bitcoins something that he
[13:20] didn't do yet but he he create this meme
[13:23] coin that is making billion of dollars
[13:27] and you know I don't think think that's
[13:29] making good for America and then and
[13:32] then now he he's using like Solana
[13:35] blockchain and using and buying like rap
[13:38] Bitcoins he's not talking about Bitcoin
[13:40] so I don't know I didn't like at all but
[13:43] that makes sense because as a
[13:45] politici and and that's why we cannot
[13:48] separate politics from economy because
[13:50] in the end of the day uh the president
[13:54] will will say who is going to be uh the
[13:59] the the the central bank right who who
[14:01] is going to be in charge of the central
[14:03] banks and that going to that are going
[14:05] to influence a lot on the economy and
[14:09] and they want votes so they want to say
[14:11] anything to get in in the off you know
[14:14] they're gonna uh they're gonna and
[14:16] that's why we have this huge welfare
[14:18] system people the thing is people want
[14:20] free [ __ ] you know most people want free
[14:23] [ __ ] they don't want to work for stuff
[14:25] they just want uh they want the print
[14:28] money to keep going and and politicians
[14:31] they want to be elected so they're going
[14:32] to tell whatever these guys want to hear
[14:36] so they can vote so that's why I cannot
[14:38] separate politics and Bitcoin but I
[14:41] think I think at the same time it's good
[14:44] it's bad I think Trump is gonna gonna
[14:47] expose a lot of people to to crypto but
[14:50] not to bitcoin so I don't know if this
[14:52] is a good or a bad thing I think we are
[14:54] in the first day we have to wait and see
[14:57] but the first message for me was not
[14:59] good I didn't like the the Trump coin
[15:02] and especially if you see like the the
[15:05] tokenomics of the of his coin like a
[15:10] billion coins he has like a300 Millions
[15:13] with the with in his company he sell 200
[15:17] Millions so he can dump all this the
[15:20] this stuff on the heads of who bought
[15:22] the coin I I don't like at all but we
[15:26] have to wait and see what he's going to
[15:27] do abs absolutely it's interesting
[15:30] because uh you probably would have had
[15:32] the possibilities to create your own
[15:34] coin and to create some something along
[15:36] those lines and or promote something
[15:39] else
[15:40] what how did you resist the the the
[15:44] quick money that you could make in
[15:46] crypto the quick money in in meme coins
[15:48] and and stuck to to basically Bitcoin
[15:51] only how did you get the difference
[15:52] between crypto and and Bitcoin so
[15:55] quickly there is a huge difference if
[15:57] you know what Bitcoin is you don't want
[15:59] to buy on all stuff because like I say
[16:02] who is the owner of Bitcoin there is no
[16:04] owner who create Bitcoin nobody knows so
[16:07] very decentralized and I think what
[16:10] makes Bitcoin special it it is that is
[16:14] always more is out is almost like a
[16:17] religion because we don't know who found
[16:19] it's something that came like to save us
[16:21] from central banks like we saw that on
[16:23] the on the Genesis block right like the
[16:26] two8 bay outs of the banks that's why it
[16:29] was created and and I feel it's going to
[16:32] be impossible to rep replicate any
[16:37] cryptocurrency because because if people
[16:40] create if I create a a cryptocurreny
[16:43] right now and I say no this is going to
[16:45] be my reserve of value it's not going to
[16:48] be it's not going to be
[16:50] because because man my English is not
[16:52] that good to explain what I want but the
[16:55] the the the point
[16:57] is you have a conf of Interest right
[17:00] here because I'm creating the coin and I
[17:02] I will make money of that and I want
[17:05] this coin to succeed and I I just don't
[17:08] think it's right you know I think we
[17:09] have Bitcoin and I think every other
[17:11] coin that you're creating you just suck
[17:14] in liquidity of that could be to the
[17:17] Bitcoin going to other to other MIM
[17:20] coins and and and coins that they want
[17:24] they say they are better than Bitcoin
[17:26] but in the reality they are not because
[17:28] they have owner they have companies
[17:30] behind and they have like a agenda you
[17:32] know like this axr xrp right they say
[17:36] it's good but it's just centralized
[17:38] Bitcoin it's like the worst is like a
[17:40] cbdc is like something that you don't
[17:43] want to buy but people don't care they
[17:45] won't buy because they think he going to
[17:47] to to the moon like they
[17:49] say and I don't want to I don't want to
[17:51] Quick Buck you know uh that that's my
[17:54] mindset I want to leave of my uh of my
[17:58] labor you know you know I want to make
[18:00] money and I want to invest money in a
[18:02] good and hard and sound asset like
[18:05] Bitcoin so I don't want to get I don't
[18:08] want to get reach quick I love that
[18:10] that's that's really nice mindset um is
[18:13] that also kind of the the proof of work
[18:17] that you see in the like the proof of
[18:19] work Concept in Bitcoin uh there's like
[18:22] there's obviously in Bitcoin proof of
[18:24] work concept for mining but a lot of the
[18:26] community also sees proof of work as
[18:29] just this mindset shift of like I want
[18:31] to put in my physical energy to get in
[18:35] the financial to get out the financial
[18:37] energy and I don't want to take the
[18:40] shortcuts I don't want to cheat I don't
[18:42] want to grade a meme coin just to dump
[18:44] it on anyone else that's kind of the
[18:46] fear mindset the Bitcoin mindset is like
[18:48] this proof of work mindset and it feels
[18:50] like you really Empower that that
[18:53] mindset uh probably also with like your
[18:55] sports background I I guess Sports
[18:57] people in general no matter what they do
[18:59] if they're like fighting if they're
[19:00] running if they're playing whatever
[19:03] football or something like that they
[19:04] probably are really primed to to to the
[19:07] Bitcoin because they all get this proof
[19:09] of work um concept this proof of work
[19:12] mindset is that is that right exactly
[19:15] and MMA is proof of work you know there
[19:17] is no there is no shortcuts no no nobody
[19:21] going to hand you anything you know if
[19:23] you want to to to win you have to train
[19:26] if you don't train hard you're going to
[19:27] lose and if you lose you have to be held
[19:30] accountable of your of your decisions
[19:33] like I did I just I just lost my I just
[19:36] lost the most important fight of my life
[19:38] on Saturday you know that was for a Bel
[19:41] uh I make huge money I make very good
[19:44] money but if I had win I would make a
[19:46] lot more and I would get a lot more
[19:48] exposure but that's life I cannot change
[19:51] that and if you have like fancy currency
[19:54] mindset you're going to you're going to
[19:55] regret you're going to say ah or you're
[19:58] going to you're gonna blame somebody but
[20:00] the only one to to blame is myself you
[20:03] know I went over there and I couldn't do
[20:05] what I was supposed to do so I have to
[20:07] live with the consequences and I like
[20:10] this proof of work because right now I
[20:12] can watch the tape watch what I did
[20:15] wrong watch what I did right and get
[20:18] better for the next one so my mind was
[20:21] always like that with sports but with
[20:23] money was not like that until Bitcoin
[20:25] and then I realized Bitcoin and sports
[20:28] they are just the nature is the nature
[20:31] of the market is freedom uh and
[20:35] and
[20:36] uh uh how do I say I don't know the the
[20:39] the word in English but it's like you
[20:42] it's like jumping the roof you can jump
[20:45] the roof but you're going going to die
[20:46] is the same thing uh you you have
[20:49] to uh is
[20:52] freedom uh I I don't know the word in
[20:55] English but what I want to say is do
[20:57] whatever you want if you see you're
[20:59] going to live another day if you do if
[21:01] you do something wrong you're goingon to
[21:03] uh you're going to die so I'm I'm I'm
[21:06] All About free market and and free
[21:08] choices you know so uh do whatever you
[21:11] want and let's see tomorrow who was
[21:13] right and I think the Bitcoin is that
[21:15] mindset in couple years we uh like five
[21:18] years ago people were laughing at
[21:20] Bitcoin and now we seeing Bitcoin at
[21:23] 100K so who was right and who was wrong
[21:26] it kind of reminds me of the mindset of
[21:29] with a lot of power comes a lot of
[21:32] responsibility and I think that's what
[21:34] Bitcoin is all about you have all the
[21:36] power uh like you hold your own Keys
[21:38] nobody can take it away from you uh you
[21:41] can lose those keys uh you can send it
[21:44] to the wrong address uh you can send it
[21:46] to an address and you're like oh I
[21:47] didn't want to do that and like stuff
[21:49] like that uh you can mess up your self
[21:52] custody setup you can do all those
[21:54] things
[21:55] wrong but nobody can stop you from
[21:58] acting nobody can take your money away
[22:01] and this full power comes with the
[22:03] responsibility and that's what you're
[22:05] saying also with the fights of like if
[22:07] you uh go in the fight you either win or
[22:10] lose uh and uh it's your responsibility
[22:15] to train to to get ready for the fight
[22:17] and if you lose uh it's it's on you and
[22:20] you don't blame anyone else you cannot
[22:22] blame anyone else of course you could
[22:23] blame someone else but in reality it's
[22:26] it's all on you and I think that respon
[22:28] responsibility uh we seeing reflected in
[22:31] Bitcoin and I I love the the example
[22:34] with the fire really cool yeah exactly I
[22:37] could blame but but listen I I am in
[22:41] pursuit of the true I always looking for
[22:44] the true what is true and what is beauty
[22:47] and what is moral you know I like morals
[22:50] I think there is right and there is
[22:52] wrong so every time that I look to
[22:55] something I want the true I want to see
[22:57] the TR so I could even blame my coaches
[23:00] or blame another another person for my
[23:03] decision but that would not be the TRU
[23:05] and I want to see the true so I can
[23:08] improve it's just that I just want to
[23:10] make more money I just want to suce
[23:12] succeed if I don't see the true I will
[23:14] not succeed you know I saw I saw Jeff
[23:17] Bezos talking about that because he say
[23:20] people don't like the TRU that's that's
[23:22] the truth even me I don't like the TRU I
[23:25] don't like to see that I fail but if I
[23:27] don't see the true I cannot fix what was
[23:30] wrong so if you like money if you like
[23:33] to succeed in life you have to see what
[23:36] was why you did wrong and that's why
[23:38] truth is so important and I think
[23:40] Bitcoin is the true and the financial
[23:43] Market you cannot hide it the price is
[23:45] due to the to the stock and flow and to
[23:49] the uh and to to the demand like in the
[23:51] supply and the demand is it is the true
[23:54] free market asset you know nobody
[23:58] control controls and the prices
[24:00] fluctuations are something normal
[24:02] because people are buying and selling
[24:04] and according with the the demand the
[24:07] price goes up or goes down so I think it
[24:11] is the same thing with fighting I see
[24:13] what is wrong what is right and I want
[24:15] to improve and I want to make more money
[24:18] and that's why I was so I was so uh
[24:23] attached now I'm so attached to this
[24:25] Bitcoin
[24:26] mentality oh I I love that really cool
[24:29] what did you actually do before you your
[24:32] a fight did did you do something before
[24:36] that or this was this your start of the
[24:38] career no I I'm I did I went to the law
[24:41] school you know I went to the law school
[24:43] and I stopped like I did two years two
[24:46] years and a half I was in I was half
[24:50] half College in Brazil uh I was supposed
[24:53] to be a a lawyer or or something like
[24:56] that but then uh I start to fight
[24:59] professionally and I say [ __ ] that I
[25:01] want to fight you know I love that I
[25:03] have been training since I was 11 years
[25:05] old and and but but but professionally
[25:11] that was my my first job was to be a
[25:14] fighter and a coach because I was being
[25:16] I was training to fight MMA but I was
[25:19] coaching other people too I had my own
[25:21] own Gene at the time like 10 years ago
[25:23] so I always was involved with
[25:26] fighting okay so you also basically a
[25:29] business owner and and and coaching
[25:30] people really cool why did you like that
[25:33] that's I I love stories when people
[25:36] follow their passion and just don't go
[25:39] with the conventional way because I
[25:40] could imagine uh back in the day your
[25:43] parents and the environment would said
[25:45] like oh like go to law school be a
[25:47] doctor be that like that's kind of the
[25:49] normal way to do why did you take the
[25:51] decision to go fighting that's like
[25:55] seems uncommon but it's it's the It's
[25:59] You Follow Your Truth again because I
[26:01] knew it was a scam you know the life
[26:04] that they they were offering me was a
[26:06] scam because I remember my father saying
[26:09] now you have to study you have to have a
[26:11] degree and you have to work for the
[26:13] government because everybody on this
[26:15] city they do like that in Brazil you
[26:18] know I don't know how Austria is but in
[26:20] Brazil if you work for the government
[26:22] you are in the best place because you
[26:23] make money regardless right they're
[26:25] going to pay you even if you do a good
[26:27] or a bad job so I'm from the capital of
[26:30] the city Brazilia and everybody like my
[26:33] parents my sister my my cousins
[26:36] everybody my my uncle everybody had a
[26:39] dream to have a degree and to work for
[26:41] the government everybody and I see and I
[26:44] was seeing man that's that's bad that's
[26:46] wrong that's a life that I don't like I
[26:47] don't want to be a bu a bureaucrat and
[26:51] probably one day this is not going to
[26:53] work for everybody because if
[26:54] everybody's going to that that's going
[26:56] to be more uh competition right
[26:59] everybody's trying to do the same I will
[27:01] try to do my stuff and I will follow my
[27:04] dreams you know I don't care about other
[27:06] people think I will do what I like
[27:09] because if you think about that if you
[27:11] do what you like you have the most
[27:13] chances to succeed because you're going
[27:15] to do every day you know one thing is
[27:18] doing something that you don't like so
[27:20] let's say you don't like your work let's
[27:21] say you don't don't like the life you
[27:23] you live so every day is bad you're
[27:26] going to the work is not something that
[27:28] love so probably you're not going to
[27:30] spend like your free time working on
[27:33] that and you're never going to be as
[27:35] good as you do be if you if you had
[27:38] something that you like so I just love
[27:40] MMA I just love fighting I was watching
[27:42] all the time I was good and I say [ __ ]
[27:45] I'm going for it I don't care and I'm
[27:47] gonna make it happen you know and and
[27:50] that was my mindset at the time I say
[27:52] [ __ ] school [ __ ] College I'm going to
[27:54] the United States I'm going to try my
[27:56] best to be a fighter and I'm going to
[27:59] make it work and I did I love that yeah
[28:02] you definitely uh did what was kind of
[28:05] the reaction of your environment when
[28:07] you when you did that was what were they
[28:09] supportive of you no no everybody won
[28:13] say man you you going to be poor you
[28:15] don't know you don't know what you're
[28:17] doing you you you're living a good life
[28:19] to live a dream and that's not going to
[28:22] work and and it's funny because usually
[28:25] is the people closer to you they're
[28:27] going to say that stuff
[28:28] and now and now I know why because they
[28:32] are afraid you know they are afraid for
[28:35] themselves too because they think if
[28:36] this guy succeed you know if everything
[28:40] goes right on his life that
[28:42] means and we are on the we were on the
[28:45] same start you know that means if I
[28:48] don't succeed is my fault you know what
[28:50] I mean
[28:51] so they that's why people don't want to
[28:53] see you you going up in life because
[28:56] that means if you're going up and they
[28:58] not going up is their fault and then
[29:00] that that stuff that we are talking
[29:02] about that about seeing the true they
[29:05] don't want to see the true and then they
[29:06] want to blame you they want to stop you
[29:09] to to achieve your dreams but I never
[29:11] care about people you know too much I
[29:13] never care about people too much I care
[29:15] about myself what I can do how can I
[29:18] improve what can I do to be best for my
[29:22] family and for society and I think
[29:24] that's the way to think I partnered up
[29:27] with coin vigilante this is the most

[31:38] that's really cool
[31:40] almost did you lose Friends Along along
[31:42] the way yeah a lot of friends a lot of
[31:45] friends and it is what it is you know
[31:51] because nowadays I think friends are not
[31:53] that important I think family is more
[31:55] important than friends because you can
[31:58] have friends but if you win if you make
[32:02] money you're going to have friends and
[32:04] if you're not you you're not going to
[32:06] have friends so I think you know it's
[32:08] kind of they just like you when you're
[32:10] winning so you have to stick with people
[32:12] that W were with you be before you you
[32:17] were famous or or had money because H
[32:20] this is just life you know and like I
[32:23] say I don't care too much if people
[32:25] don't like what I have to say uh if you
[32:28] if you don't like what I have to say you
[32:30] don't want to be my friend that's fine I
[32:31] don't I don't care too
[32:33] so I don't know I guess I lost I lost a
[32:36] couple
[32:37] friends I can imagine
[32:42] yeah but it's natural like if if if if
[32:45] they want to stay where they are they
[32:47] are at and and you want to exceed in
[32:49] life it kind of drifts apart uh I I I I
[32:54] yeah it's really interesting is the so
[32:56] for you the family unit is kind of the
[32:59] the most important thing like the the
[33:01] your your partner your your kids and and
[33:04] your maybe your parents maybe your
[33:06] uncles and stuff like that is that that
[33:08] is the main important thing for you 100%
[33:11] you know family for me is everything
[33:13] family is why I'm buying Bitcoin it's
[33:16] why I am spending all this time studying
[33:20] and getting better and fighting uh if I
[33:22] didn't have family I would not I I would
[33:25] not have a purpose to doing that you
[33:27] know because okay it's just me but I'm
[33:30] fighting for my family I'm fighting for
[33:32] my children and for a better future for
[33:34] them so I think that's very important
[33:37] and some people think ah but you you to
[33:40] uh
[33:41] individually but if everybody is selfish
[33:44] and individualist and everybody took
[33:46] care of the family the world will be a
[33:48] much better place because it is easy to
[33:51] care about people in Africa you know
[33:53] when you don't when you don't help your
[33:55] you like your your your your friends or
[33:58] your brothers it's easy to care about
[34:01] people in in [ __ ] Iraq or something
[34:05] and don't care about your neighbor so
[34:07] it's very easy to be a socialist and
[34:09] it's very easy to be because it's all
[34:12] this people money and it's very easy to
[34:14] be good with all this people money and
[34:17] to help people that you don't see every
[34:18] day so I try my best to be the best
[34:21] father that I can to be the best friend
[34:23] that I can to be the best husband that I
[34:25] can but that comes to to a price you
[34:28] know sometimes to be a good father you
[34:30] have to be tough on your kid somebody to
[34:32] to have a good uh to be a good friend
[34:35] you have to tell the truth to your
[34:36] friend that he doesn't want to listen so
[34:39] like I say everything in my life I apply
[34:41] the same mentality as the bit as a
[34:44] Bitcoin you know truth all the time tell
[34:47] the truth all the time do what is right
[34:49] do what is moral and and and preference
[34:54] temporal preference I think that's the
[34:56] the key the key word for for my life now
[34:59] I love that uh was this always something
[35:02] uh that you had in mind or also did you
[35:05] discover that with Bitcoin this uh like
[35:08] this libertarian cons
[35:11] conservative I'm also Austrian I also
[35:13] cannot speak English nicely sometimes
[35:16] but were you always like a Libertarian
[35:18] of of of of that point of view no like I
[35:22] I would say I was more a conservative
[35:24] you know because Brazilian is a very
[35:26] Catholic country we we very religious we
[35:29] believe in God but uh this concept of
[35:32] the libertarianism and all that all that
[35:34] stuff that CES with Bitcoin and in the a
[35:37] economic school I was not like that you
[35:39] know back in the day I used to think
[35:42] that that the government was a good
[35:44] thing you know because my father told me
[35:47] that and he said no there is a lot of
[35:48] bad people so the government has to
[35:50] intervene and make sure that the the bad
[35:53] people don't [ __ ] the good people but
[35:55] when you understand when you when you
[35:57] start to understand about private
[35:59] property and government and you realize
[36:01] the government is the bad guy you know
[36:04] if you don't pay your tax they're going
[36:05] to throw you in the jail and they only
[36:07] think they only do things worse because
[36:10] in in the end of the day it's a game of
[36:13] power they want Power they will they
[36:15] will do everything that they can to
[36:17] seize and to be on the power and then
[36:21] comes inflation because to make to be on
[36:24] the power they have to please the crowds
[36:26] and the crowds want free stuff and and
[36:28] then I realize the government is is one
[36:32] thing that is not letting us free
[36:37] economically and and politically you
[36:39] know so so I don't know if you if we
[36:43] ever could be like a in a true
[36:45] libertarian sense that no government but
[36:47] to me is small government you know to me
[36:51] less interference less uh less uh
[36:54] restrictions I think uh the society
[36:57] should be run by individuals and and the
[37:00] free choices of the market I love that
[37:04] he I also root always for the
[37:06] politicians that want less less State
[37:09] less government if politician says oh we
[37:11] want to cut spending we want to cut that
[37:14] that's always they they have my vote
[37:17] have but but but who gonna say that
[37:19] imagine if Trump comes and say hey I
[37:21] gonna cut Social uh Social Security I
[37:24] gonna stop uh stop uh
[37:28] the pensions are going to stop that stop
[37:30] this once once the politic the polit the
[37:34] the once they they do something for the
[37:37] people like they give free money is
[37:39] almost impossible to reverse because
[37:41] every other politic politician that
[37:43] comes over there and say hey I gonna cut
[37:46] that stuff they're not going to be elect
[37:47] so you have to go along with these
[37:49] policies from years and years ago you
[37:51] know uh but we are getting in a
[37:54] situation that the debit is just too
[37:55] high because the party is like is almost
[38:00] coming to an end because there was too
[38:02] much party too much printing of money
[38:05] too much the bunking of of the system so
[38:08] the the the financial system right now
[38:11] is in a is in a bring of a collapse you
[38:13] know no but I don't know how we're gonna
[38:15] pay the debit if every year the the the
[38:19] United States the debt is growing bigger
[38:21] and bigger and they just paying the
[38:23] interest they are not even paying the
[38:25] debit so you see the the and that's the
[38:28] best the best country in the world the
[38:31] the the the biggest economy in the world
[38:33] if you look all the economy they are
[38:35] even worse you know the dollar sucks I I
[38:38] have dollars because I have to leave but
[38:40] imagine you have Brazilian ha or
[38:42] Argentinian Pesos or other every other
[38:46] currency in the world so the dollar is
[38:49] bad the problem is the other coins are
[38:51] the other the other money is worse so I
[38:55] don't know how much longer we can can
[38:57] sustain the
[38:59] situation do you think a Global
[39:01] Financial collapse uh is inevitable it's
[39:04] it's just like something that will come
[39:05] anyways at some point I don't know I
[39:09] don't know how long because I don't know
[39:11] how long we take but I think we're going
[39:13] to have changes in the world you know
[39:15] especially with the globalization uh
[39:18] even Trump now is is signalized that he
[39:20] going to stop this he want to create
[39:23] more jobs in America and Factory so I
[39:25] think the economy
[39:28] that was once very very globalized is
[39:31] going to be reduced to the countries and
[39:33] the country is not going to be so close
[39:35] to each other and and uh every social
[39:39] State collapse right we we have read
[39:41] about the wayar Republic we have read
[39:44] about Argentina and and we have this
[39:48] milkshake Theory too the The Economist
[39:50] talking about how the dollar goingon to
[39:52] suck up all the liquidity all over the
[39:54] world and I believe that I don't know
[39:56] how long we take but it's just mad right
[40:00] if you spend the more money that you're
[40:01] getting eventually you will collapse if
[40:04] the social State and if the welfare
[40:06] state keep printing money and giving
[40:09] people welfare and not cutting expenses
[40:12] how they going to survive eventually
[40:15] they're going to broke the financial
[40:16] system I don't know when and I don't
[40:18] know how why but eventually the the
[40:22] Legacy system will
[40:24] broke absolutely it's just a matter of
[40:27] time then uh it's do do you see Bitcoin
[40:30] also as your retirement uh plan is is
[40:33] that kind of like where you see like
[40:36] okay once I want to stop fighting once I
[40:38] stop my career little Lo is Bitcoin uh
[40:41] basically your private Pension
[40:45] Plan yes but I don't know I have to
[40:48] learn so much about it I have to you
[40:50] know I have to understand that and I I
[40:53] have heard people saying that eventually
[40:55] Bitcoin will be like asset that you can
[40:58] Co that you can collateralize you know
[41:01] to get money and to live off the money
[41:03] without without spending your Bitcoins I
[41:05] have to learn more about that about the
[41:08] uh I don't know if this will be I think
[41:11] it is right people are starting to do
[41:13] that kind of stuff but uh for now I just
[41:16] see Bitcoin as a reserve of value you
[41:19] know all my money I put into Bitcoin not
[41:22] all my money but I put my money Bitcoin
[41:24] and like it's safe it's secure and in if
[41:28] I keep for five years I'm not going to
[41:29] lose any money and eventually I gonna
[41:32] make some money off that so that that's
[41:35] that's how I see Bitcoin I love that
[41:38] really cool um maybe to get some some
[41:41] education in in in there it's like what
[41:44] is what formed your opinion on bitcoin
[41:48] the most I think you already mentioned
[41:50] the Bitcoin standard were the other uh
[41:52] things that you looked at maybe other
[41:54] people that were influential in your uh
[41:57] forming of your Bitcoin opinion yes yes
[42:00] like
[42:02] uh I knew about Bitcoin I knew about the
[42:04] technology I knew about like uh like how
[42:07] the nodes work and how the they do the
[42:10] proof of work and how the system work
[42:12] and how was decentralized and all that
[42:14] stuff but then I read a book of a
[42:17] Brazilian guy his name is henatu amuedo
[42:19] the name of the book was Bitcoin red
[42:21] pill and then I watch I read the book
[42:26] and on this book were full of aors right
[42:30] because he was not talking about only
[42:33] Bitcoin he was talking about morals and
[42:34] all that stuff and then I went to to
[42:37] check the AOS and uh I I saw a lot of
[42:41] stuff stuff that I like and then I
[42:42] realized that Bitcoin is not only a
[42:44] financial instrument Bitcoin is like you
[42:48] say is something that is moral is way
[42:50] more moral to put your money on
[42:53] bitcoin it's just simple like that if
[42:55] you think the government is bad why
[42:58] would you finance the government by
[43:00] bonds and why would you buy stocks
[43:04] they're going to pay taxes to the
[43:06] government you know if you're buying
[43:08] stocks you're financing the government
[43:11] so for me it's just a way to get out of
[43:15] the system that you don't agree you know
[43:17] let's say you don't agree with the war
[43:19] in Ukraine if you paying taxes you're
[43:21] supporting that if you let's say you
[43:23] don't like let's say you let's say you
[43:26] live in a place that that you cannot
[43:27] smoke weed or drink you know and uh and
[43:31] if you like to smoke weed or drink and
[43:33] you think that's that's moral that you
[43:36] don't see any problem on that if you're
[43:38] paying your taxes you're helping the
[43:40] government to enforce the law and a
[43:41] Bitcoin is a way to get out of this you
[43:44] know so with this book I I start to to
[43:48] go down the rabbit hole and I and one
[43:51] thing goes you know you start to see and
[43:54] then here we are talking to bitcoin to
[43:58] everybody nice I love that Bitcoin is
[44:01] kind of the only true libertarian tool I
[44:03] feel like we have the only tool that
[44:06] where we can extract the the power from
[44:08] from the government as you say I think
[44:10] it's really nice uh what you say of like
[44:13] uh when we buy anything else like we we
[44:16] kind of Finance the the government uh
[44:20] and that's it's a beautiful way to look
[44:21] at it it and losing money too and losing
[44:24] money too because even if you put money
[44:25] on your on the bonds
[44:27] they are P they are paying you 5% but
[44:30] why they are paying
[44:32] 5% why
[44:35] because because probably you're losing
[44:37] to the inflation you're losing to the
[44:38] money supply if they pay 5% but the
[44:41] money supply is 7% you're losing you're
[44:43] still losing is the negative yield right
[44:46] uh so if you understand that and if you
[44:49] understand that it's very hard to make
[44:51] money out of investment nowadays and
[44:54] even if you do you are you are financing
[44:56] the the government it's just the natural
[44:59] thing go to the Bitcoin that is like the
[45:02] machine of true right the true
[45:04] libertarian like you say the true
[45:06] libertarian asset
[45:08] absolutely uh I didn't research that but
[45:11] do you also get paid in in in Bitcoin is
[45:14] that possible for UFC fighters no I got
[45:16] paid in dollars and then I do my my
[45:19] diligence uh buying buying Bitcoin and
[45:23] and and stuff but I don't get paid in
[45:25] Bitcoin yet not yet oh so that's but I
[45:29] think I can I think I can do so that's
[45:31] something that that you would like to to
[45:33] do in the future getting paid in Bitcoin
[45:35] yeah I I can just tell you from personal
[45:38] experience I got uh with the podcast the
[45:40] first time I ever got paid in Bitcoin
[45:43] last year and it's an amazing feeling to
[45:45] get directly in yourself C setup the
[45:48] Bitcoin it's it's like it's a feeling of
[45:50] another world I I love that a lot
[45:52] actually it's it's it's it's amazing
[45:55] thing so so but how you do I I need to
[45:58] understand that because I was watching
[46:00] an interview of of what's the name of
[46:02] the guy Jackie mler do you know yeah
[46:05] Jack mes yeah from stri M from Strike
[46:07] yeah I was reading that he don't he
[46:10] don't have any dollars everything that
[46:13] he does right he does on bitcoin I don't
[46:16] know if he has a credit card or stuff
[46:18] like that that pay I want to learn about
[46:19] that but I don't know yet do you know
[46:21] what it is H yes I think Czech malas
[46:25] does it like that he has a credit card
[46:28] where he pays the things that he cannot
[46:31] pay in Bitcoin because there are a lot
[46:32] of things that you cannot pay in Bitcoin
[46:34] currently and then once a month you pay
[46:36] off the credit card using Bitcoin so you
[46:39] just like once a month send Bitcoin to
[46:41] the credit card and paying off the the
[46:43] credit card if you have no uh dollars I
[46:46] think that's how Jack males does it you
[46:48] can also I think strike actually does
[46:50] that with check maras where uh you can
[46:54] get the money and right when it comes in
[46:57] uh you can split it like 70% Bitcoin 30%
[47:00] your dollars whatever you do so you can
[47:02] have something like that uh and what I
[47:04] do is I have uh some income that has to
[47:08] be in in in feat because of like YouTube
[47:11] ad revenue and some uh some stores and
[47:14] stuff like that that I have that has to
[47:15] be feat that I keeping feat and pay my
[47:18] fat bills and uh the rest I keep in
[47:21] Bitcoin and that's usually my surplus of
[47:24] the business and I just keep it in
[47:25] Bitcoin I've never touched it one year
[47:28] there might be a time where I have to
[47:30] touch it and then I probably use a
[47:32] credit card that I can pay off with uh
[47:35] with Bitcoin or figure out how to
[47:37] directly pay people in Bitcoin maybe
[47:39] like an employee and say like hey you
[47:41] can work for me about only if you take
[47:42] Bitcoin and stuff like that so I hope to
[47:46] to get more into that also as you said
[47:48] there are things like you can uh borrow
[47:52] against your Bitcoin so kind of like
[47:55] collateralize your your Bitcoins I don't
[47:58] do that it's it seems very risky because
[48:01] I don't want to lose my Bitcoin like if
[48:04] if you give out one Bitcoin that's
[48:06] $100,000 and you get $20,000 back uh
[48:10] with the chance of losing that one
[48:12] Bitcoin like that's a bad
[48:14] deal yeah I understand what you're
[48:16] saying so but yeah like there are there
[48:18] are a lot of tools out there and they
[48:20] getting PID in Bitcoin just feels so
[48:23] awesome I like that a lot
[48:26] and but I I don't know how how how is
[48:29] the taxes right because you you have if
[48:32] you have something like that you have to
[48:33] pay a lot of taxes too because you're
[48:36] putting out Bitcoin every time and like
[48:38] I say I never sold any Bitcoin and
[48:41] that's something that I don't want to I
[48:43] don't want to mess and let me let me ask
[48:46] you another question so the revenue that
[48:49] you make in that you that you do from
[48:53] your podcast is from from YouTube and
[48:55] then you put on B coin uh the revenue uh
[48:59] so like I have YouTube ad Revenue but my
[49:02] majority of the revenue comes from my
[49:04] sponsors those are Bitcoin companies
[49:07] like do Bitcoin watches Bitcoin
[49:08] exchanges Bitcoin Hardware wallets stuff
[49:10] like that and they pay me in Bitcoin
[49:13] okay uh and they pay directly so there's
[49:16] a tool like sep right uh that I use uh
[49:20] and uh there you can can just connect
[49:23] the hardware your selfcast setup to sep
[49:26] right and then you can send them payment
[49:29] links and then they can directly pay
[49:31] whenever they want and it's instant
[49:33] settlement you have an invoice if you
[49:35] have to do tax and stuff like that but
[49:37] yeah like taxes is something that a lot
[49:39] of people um this keeps the kind of the
[49:44] um adoption of Bitcoin as a Medi of
[49:47] exchange uh lower because me also I I
[49:50] never sold Bitcoin uh because I still
[49:53] have a Fiat income and with the Fiat
[49:55] income I can pay off my bills yeah but
[49:57] at some point if the Bitcoin income
[50:00] grows and grows and grows I have to pay
[50:04] pay my pay with my Bitcoin at some point
[50:07] uh but yeah it's it's it's a diff
[50:09] difficult topic one thing maybe uh to
[50:13] consider and maybe I I'm curious what
[50:14] you are thinking about that but if you
[50:17] have 100% in Bitcoin and you have no
[50:19] dollars at all you have to spend your
[50:21] Bitcoin and then you have to pay capital
[50:24] gains tax on that but you only pay gains
[50:27] tax on profits that you make so if you
[50:29] hold otherwise feed and they're flat uh
[50:33] you don't have to pay uh capital gains
[50:35] tax and that but if your Bitcoin Rising
[50:39] uh you you you're only paying capital
[50:41] gains tax on on profits anyways so you
[50:45] you always are better getting into
[50:47] Bitcoin versus having dollars okay like
[50:50] holding Bitcoin is seems to be always a
[50:51] better choice uh as as dollars uh but
[50:55] yeah like I don't know if you're
[50:57] comfortable um sharing that but what is
[50:59] kind of your like uh portfolio looking
[51:02] like of of percentage of Bitcoin versus
[51:04] non-bitcoin and cash and stuff like that
[51:06] but you don't like we can cut it out if
[51:08] you don't want to share that no no it's
[51:11] okay you know um like I don't really
[51:13] like debit you know I don't really like
[51:16] debit and and I put a lot of my money on
[51:20] on on bitcoin but not everything because
[51:23] I want to I want to pay off my houses I
[51:25] have two houses and I want to pay off my
[51:28] houses and then I will put everything on
[51:30] on on bitcoin I have some other incomes
[51:33] than fighting too and and I have other
[51:36] business right on the on the that I that
[51:41] I make on Fiat but uh on the next couple
[51:44] years I want to put everything on
[51:46] bitcoin I want to put everything on
[51:48] bitcoin that that that's a goal for me
[51:51] but I'm still not 100% on bitcoin
[51:55] because I want to
[51:57] get out of debit on everything that I am
[52:00] right now and then I can just put my
[52:03] money on bitcoin and keep going I love
[52:06] that really cool um I have before we
[52:09] come to the closer to the end routine uh
[52:11] one two more questions around martial
[52:12] arts and uh and this aspect um is that
[52:16] something that you um encourage people
[52:19] to learn even though they don't want to
[52:21] be fight as something that a skill for
[52:24] life kind of they they should do I think
[52:27] so because it's very important for me to
[52:30] to know that I can defend myself you
[52:32] know it's like a knowledge it's money is
[52:36] knowledge too Bitcoin is knowledge too
[52:38] is you can defend yourself from the
[52:40] government you can defend yourself from
[52:41] for inflation and I and I think MMA or
[52:45] any kind of Martial training is good so
[52:47] you don't need to use it but you feel
[52:49] that you can uh fight back you know uh
[52:54] it's very bad to be in a world that you
[52:55] know that you can not defend yourself or
[52:57] your family so I really encourage you
[53:00] people to to to learn martial arts even
[53:04] though if you not want to compete
[53:06] because like like we was saying on the
[53:09] beginning it's very close to bitcoin and
[53:11] to proof of work so you go you go to the
[53:14] gym you put everything that you that you
[53:17] have on on the workout on the sessions
[53:20] then you feel great you feel man I did I
[53:22] did what I was supposed to do and then
[53:25] uh you you get healthier right yeah you
[53:28] get stronger you get sharper and you get
[53:31] ready to defend yourself so it's a gain
[53:34] gain situation all the time you gain you
[53:36] gain from the skills you gain from from
[53:39] like you get stronger you you get to be
[53:42] more uh like discipline focus and calm
[53:47] because once you know that you can fight
[53:49] you don't need to fight you know back in
[53:52] the day was I was I didn't know how to
[53:55] fight I was always afraid man if I have
[53:57] to fight so that that caused me a lot of
[53:59] trouble but now like I feel I can defend
[54:02] myself and even if somebody wants to to
[54:06] fight me I say man no I don't need you
[54:08] know because I know I know that I can
[54:11] defend myself so I don't need to prove
[54:13] anybody and not even to myself that I
[54:15] that I know and I can't fight so I I
[54:18] really encourage you people to start a m
[54:20] training or even kind of competition to
[54:23] get healthier stronger and and uh and
[54:28] self-confidence I love that is there any
[54:31] recommendation of like there are so many
[54:32] different martial arts Styles you you
[54:35] can do is anything that someone that
[54:37] never did any martial arts that they
[54:39] should start with with that kind of
[54:40] martial arts any Mar wats I think boxing
[54:44] is a very good way to start because of
[54:46] course you have less stuff to worry
[54:49] about it's just hands I'm not saying box
[54:52] is easier but uh is easier to throw
[54:55] punches than the throw punches and kicks
[54:57] you know it's easiest to throw punches
[54:59] and kicks then throw punches and kicks
[55:01] and take Downs so you start with a
[55:04] little start with boxing or kickboxing
[55:06] Jiu-Jitsu and if you really like keep
[55:09] adding all the marshal arts to to your
[55:11] to your training routine but if you
[55:13] choose one martial arts and if you LIF
[55:15] to some weights and if you and if you
[55:17] eat good and if you live healthy and if
[55:20] you have a family then you you're lower
[55:23] your pref temporal preference and having
[55:26] in a family and having savings is the
[55:29] best thing that can happen to you and
[55:32] your son your family will be looking up
[55:34] to you and so that's how you make
[55:36] Society great I love that I it's really
[55:40] inspirational this video uh this episode
[55:42] already for me at least um we have one
[55:46] question that I asked each and every one
[55:47] of my guests and the question is uh what
[55:50] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin I
[55:53] don't know not much you know not much
[55:55] I'm not that smart you know the only
[55:57] thing that I can teach you in a way that
[56:00] can tell you about myself is that go go
[56:04] for your dream do what you want put 100%
[56:08] on on what you want to do because it's
[56:10] possible this world this word is yours
[56:13] if you want it you know if you want if
[56:15] you really want something just go over
[56:18] there and try your best and and you're
[56:21] going to succeed did you had actually
[56:24] one fight when you were young younger
[56:27] and still not sure if you do that
[56:30] professionally where where you had like
[56:32] one fight of like okay I I want to do
[56:35] this professional like I I this is this
[56:37] is my career did you had like one fight
[56:39] that was like flipping the switch for
[56:41] you yes 100% that was my third fight you
[56:43] know I was fighting the biggest show in
[56:45] Brazil and even though I had like two
[56:49] two fight professionals before I didn't
[56:51] know if I want to be a professional you
[56:53] know but I remember the feeling of
[56:55] winning a fight and then people are
[56:58] asking you how it was and then I had
[57:00] couple reporters and I was in couple
[57:04] like uh uh MMA fighting sites and stuff
[57:08] and I say man that's cool I want to do
[57:10] that for the rest of my life and now I
[57:12] believe in myself because I did it so
[57:15] was a process but when my third fight I
[57:18] I thought man [ __ ] that I will go 100%
[57:20] on this career and since then I never
[57:23] stopped perfect that that's amazing
[57:26] amazing I like that a lot um we have an
[57:28] end rtin in the podcast where the
[57:30] previous guest is asking a question for
[57:31] the next guest without knowing who the
[57:33] next guest actually is and uh previous
[57:36] guest asked you the question how can we
[57:38] better drive Bitcoin adoption how can we
[57:41] better drive the Bitcoin adoption I
[57:42] think is a process that's going to
[57:44] happen no matter what you know I think I
[57:48] think I think to make Bitcoin better and
[57:53] greater I think we have to talk better
[57:55] about the government because the
[57:57] government was what create Bitcoin if
[58:00] the government didn't have abuse its
[58:04] power through the monetary system and to
[58:07] the bailouts and to the printing money I
[58:10] would not need Bitcoin to to save my
[58:14] energy to save my my work to to to save
[58:20] all the time that I spent training you
[58:22] know and fighting is safe and Bitcoin
[58:26] and if the government didn't have abused
[58:29] its power I could store in dollars but
[58:33] unfortunately I cannot so we have to
[58:35] talk that government is bad all the time
[58:39] and and and and Trump is just proving
[58:43] that because everybody was excited about
[58:46] Trump and excited about the the Bitcoin
[58:48] strategic Reserve I'm not saying that's
[58:50] not going to happen I'm just saying
[58:52] don't trust in politicians even if you
[58:55] like them you know because uh it it's
[58:58] like the it's like the
[59:03] the the AUST economic School the the
[59:07] system going to do what is beneficial
[59:08] for the system if if wor if Worth to lie
[59:12] and to say stuff so so the people can
[59:14] vote you they're going to do that so
[59:17] Bitcoin will drive no matter what I I
[59:20] didn't want I didn't want Trump to
[59:22] create this Ral strateg for the Bitcoin
[59:26] I want for the America because I love
[59:28] America I live in America and if he had
[59:31] created that and he start to to
[59:34] accumulate Bitcoins and if you bought
[59:36] the 1 million Bitcoin America will be
[59:38] the prosperous and the rich Nation for
[59:40] the last uh for the next 100 years but
[59:44] if he choose not that's not going to
[59:47] break Bitcoin that's going to break
[59:49] America so I think we have to talk a lot
[59:51] of [ __ ] about all governments in the
[59:53] world there is better governments and
[59:56] that is worse governments that is better
[59:58] politician is the worst politician you
[60:00] cannot compare Trump to Lula the
[60:03] president of Brazil are you you cannot
[60:05] compare mle from Argentina and buele to
[60:09] to maduru in Venezuela that that is
[60:12] better politicians and that is good
