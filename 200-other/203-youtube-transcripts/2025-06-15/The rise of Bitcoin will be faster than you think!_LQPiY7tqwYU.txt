[00:00] I think right now we are 3 years away
[00:02] from a total collapse of the dollar so
[00:04] many countries are struggling to provide
[00:07] the necessity for uh a fruitful life
[00:09] coin is the perfect representation of
[00:11] human potential energy you can create
[00:13] policy but the policy doesn't stop the
[00:16] Human Action from happening if you ask
[00:18] me what is the moral case for Bitcoin I
[00:20] would say it is to solve world
[00:23] hunger you are my I think third guest
[00:26] today that chose to be anonymous and
[00:29] it's really cool because I think it's an
[00:33] act of serving Bitcoin Community because
[00:36] without getting yourself to credit you
[00:38] know what I mean because a lot of people
[00:41] want to be in the podcast I even get now
[00:43] messages oh hey I want to be in the
[00:45] podcast I want to promote that and that
[00:47] and you chose the completely other
[00:50] Direction you don't want to promote
[00:51] anything you don't want to promote
[00:53] yourself you just want to share uh
[00:55] knowledge about Bitcoin and I think this
[00:57] is a really Noel uh thing to do
[01:00] um but before we get into the Bitcoin
[01:03] stuff I want to know like why did you
[01:06] personally chose to be anonymous and
[01:09] private for me it was um uh considering
[01:15] um just
[01:18] the
[01:20] um the objective that we all have in
[01:24] Bitcoin is to is to promote uh Bitcoin
[01:27] and um I'm not here to promote myself
[01:30] I'm dedicated uh to bitcoin because uh
[01:34] uh um what it has convinced me
[01:37] of through studying it and um um however
[01:44] um good I look and how appealing I can
[01:47] be to a crowd is uh just uh a a sid case
[01:52] to to this and uh it's I think it's
[01:56] distracting
[01:58] um and um yeah is there also a security
[02:02] reason for it or is it just uh yes so I
[02:07] I think it is unwise to if you if you're
[02:10] um um into really into Bitcoin like me I
[02:14] think in the end it it may be uh more
[02:17] prudent to uh stay Anonymous so that you
[02:21] can um or suon ninous um
[02:24] to um to make sure that you're not that
[02:28] easily found
[02:31] um and I think I think
[02:33] that with Bitcoin the the biggest threat
[02:36] to bitcoin is a social threat not uh a
[02:41] technical threat because it's proving to
[02:43] be technically
[02:44] sound um all all this time and uh I
[02:47] think in the uh near future we're going
[02:50] to
[02:51] see that people are um lashing out
[02:56] towards uh bitcoiners because bitcoiners
[02:59] are doing better than other people same
[03:01] thing happened after uh the viar
[03:05] Republic um um the papier Mark uh
[03:09] collapsed Germans started lashing out to
[03:13] uh the Jewish Community where people had
[03:15] been more uh conservative with their
[03:18] money and uh were able to uh uh divest
[03:22] right before um everything went wrong
[03:25] with the currency they didn't save they
[03:28] invested and
[03:30] um a social reaction to this out of uh
[03:35] jealousy in spite is expectable I think
[03:39] yeah I think it's also like a a danger I
[03:42] we have we actually covered that on the
[03:43] podcast a few episodes back like 10
[03:46] episodes back or something like that
[03:47] that it can be dangerous for Bitcoins it
[03:51] can be also dangerous uh for for society
[03:54] if feat is collapsing too fast and
[03:57] Bitcoin is rising up too fast because
[04:00] then uh people don't have the time to
[04:03] slowly get into the the the better store
[04:06] of value like the The Shining sip uh sh
[04:09] syncing ship analysis if you have a sh a
[04:12] syncing ship you want it to sync as slow
[04:16] as possible so people have the time to
[04:19] get rescued with Bitcoin so this is
[04:21] would be like and I think uh the the
[04:24] more um um yeah the the the slower we
[04:28] get into that uh it's the more peaceful
[04:32] it it could be but there are also people
[04:35] like I think KN swanholm says it that
[04:37] feat is so bad we have to make the
[04:40] transition as fast as possible what do
[04:42] you think is like do you think it can be
[04:44] dangerous if Bitcoin is too fast too
[04:48] successful I used to think that uh um
[04:51] Bitcoin was moving too quickly but I
[04:53] don't anymore um I think um the sinking
[04:57] ship analogy is um
[05:00] um isn't
[05:02] correct I think um um most people earn
[05:06] their
[05:07] wages uh paycheck to paycheck at this
[05:10] moment and um most aren't even really um
[05:15] earning any significant amount of money
[05:18] anyway if you look at the global
[05:20] population I think to save as many
[05:23] people as we uh as possible uh Bitcoin
[05:26] can't move fast enough because this this
[05:29] sooner uh it becomes a store of value
[05:32] for institutional parties for uh large
[05:34] corporations the sooner people start um
[05:37] um making wages in Bitcoin and um um I
[05:42] think um it's all about uh distribution
[05:45] moments so what we what we've seen from
[05:48] cycle to cycle are are distribution
[05:50] moments where large chunks get sold off
[05:53] at alltime highs and we're in in one of
[05:55] those distribution movements right
[05:58] now um and
[06:01] um many other systemic distribution
[06:05] moments will come but I'm I think that
[06:08] the the main one is uh um
[06:12] after uh all of the distribution shocks
[06:15] have occurred and um as they say
[06:20] hyperbitcoinization has happened um the
[06:23] distribution
[06:25] becomes that of people really getting
[06:28] paid in in bit coin and it doesn't
[06:30] necessarily have to be on chain of
[06:32] course because it doesn't really scale
[06:34] that well I think most people will just
[06:37] have uh
[06:39] um
[06:40] um payments in either lightning or
[06:43] liquid or a Federated mint structure um
[06:47] and uh it doesn't it doesn't matter that
[06:49] we need to use second layer
[06:52] options um for
[06:55] payment um I think it's still beneficial
[06:58] we we don't we we can rely on
[07:02] onchain uh for uh store value and
[07:05] payments can happen on different R reals
[07:09] and um I also think that um people are
[07:13] under underestimating the the in
[07:17] Innovative nature concerning with
[07:20] development and the capital being freed
[07:22] up by bull runs so um last Bull Run we
[07:27] saw um a lot of capital inflow going
[07:31] towards lightning Network
[07:35] development and um I think if Bitcoin 10
[07:39] X's or 20 X's from now we're going to
[07:41] see uh an explosion of capital coming
[07:45] into that market and just uh creating
[07:47] solutions for every every kind of
[07:49] problem that we've run into if you look
[07:52] at who is working on Federated mints
[07:54] right now it's it's maybe three
[07:57] masterminds and a couple of Developers
[08:00] uh worldwide are are doing this or are
[08:02] known to do
[08:04] this um I I may be wrong but I I don't
[08:07] see many many people on working on it
[08:09] right now and I think um in five years
[08:13] time that's going to be tens of
[08:14] thousands of developers working on
[08:17] that I think the technology will just um
[08:21] and this is what I always say in the in
[08:23] the podcast and it's it's we have to
[08:27] acknowledge that we're still so early to
[08:29] it and uh there's so much technology
[08:32] coming on top of Bitcoin there's so much
[08:33] technology still developing uh that we
[08:36] don't even know what exactly will be the
[08:39] layer two solutions as you said we have
[08:41] liquid we have fimt we have lightning
[08:44] maybe there's something new coming up
[08:46] and I'm always really bullish on the
[08:47] main layer uh and then on top of that we
[08:51] see where the money gets distributed how
[08:54] we can develop the the second layers but
[08:57] before we get um more into Bitcoin I
[08:59] want to get uh one step back to to
[09:02] privacy again um what would you
[09:04] recommend would you recommend to people
[09:06] getting into to buying no KC into coin
[09:09] mixing to improve their um privacy um
[09:15] and what would you recommend people uh
[09:17] doing in general to improve their
[09:19] Bitcoin
[09:22] privacy I think there are many solutions
[09:25] to get kyc
[09:28] free um
[09:29] Bitcoin I think the biggest problem is
[09:32] that a centralized party has collected
[09:35] your data once you buy uh kyc
[09:40] Bitcoin um and that way you become a
[09:42] target for uh the government and
[09:46] possibly when uh the the information is
[09:48] leaked also organized
[09:50] crime um so I
[09:54] think understanding that as a risk is
[09:57] important and um
[10:00] um uh you can combat this by um um
[10:06] simply moving and making making your
[10:10] your address
[10:12] obfuscated
[10:14] um there are there are there are tricks
[10:16] you can use so that you are not where
[10:20] the information says you were supposed
[10:22] to be um which which makes it more
[10:25] difficult to find you um but yes in
[10:30] uh when when orange pilling people I
[10:32] usually tell them to uh
[10:35] start um
[10:37] collecting uh no kyc uh Bitcoin just
[10:43] because it's the most uh safe way to
[10:46] start and privacy is is um uh is in the
[10:51] Bitcoin ethos I mean it's mentioned in
[10:53] the white
[10:55] paper um as one of the principles that
[10:58] we uh we are to respect that are
[11:00] important to uh uh to
[11:04] bitcoin yeah definitely
[11:06] yeah and it's it's so important and it's
[11:10] um I'm well aware that um I'm actually
[11:14] putting a little bit of a Target on
[11:15] myself because I'm publicly now known as
[11:18] a bitcoiner and I'm talking more and
[11:20] more about it and uh I'm I'm I'm also
[11:23] growing in in in the let's say social
[11:26] awareness I just got in the last month
[11:28] and it probably will be way bigger when
[11:30] the podcast comes out a th new
[11:32] subscribers on YouTube so there are like
[11:34] more and more people coming into the
[11:36] space I'm just hoping that more and more
[11:38] podcasts are coming out more and more
[11:40] people are coming up so it's it's more
[11:42] distributed and there are ways to um try
[11:46] to set up an extremely secure Bitcoin
[11:49] setup but of course if you talk publicly
[11:51] about Bitcoin it's it's a Target on your
[11:54] back uh that's definitely I'm aware of
[11:56] that I'm I was I was getting aware on on
[11:59] that after I was already public that
[12:02] Bitcoin teach me that Bitcoin has teach
[12:04] me that I was not as
[12:06] privacy um focused uh and uh as before I
[12:11] was getting into Bitcoin and I'm
[12:13] actually now getting into more and more
[12:16] how do do I get it but the guest before
[12:19] that was staying Anonymous uh said to me
[12:22] he's like once you got your message out
[12:24] there that you are Bitcoin public it's
[12:28] almost possible to get it back in like
[12:30] even if I get now full let's delete
[12:33] myself from the internet you cannot
[12:35] delete yourself completely from the
[12:36] internet uh once you set it uh you're
[12:39] basically out there obviously it's
[12:41] better if you do it afterwards um but
[12:44] this just my comments on on on privacy
[12:46] let's move to to the Bitcoin and uh I
[12:49] always like to start out with with a big
[12:52] question and a question that is like a
[12:54] little bit broader in the
[12:56] podcast um what does and this you can
[12:59] take it wherever you want to take this
[13:00] question what does proof of work and
[13:03] Bitcoin uh mean for
[13:05] you proof of work is
[13:08] um
[13:10] the necessary
[13:13] component to
[13:16] combat
[13:18] centralization and um decentralized
[13:21] money is is the thing that Bitcoin
[13:24] promises to be um and it can only be
[13:28] that that through proof of work so I
[13:32] think it's uh I think it's one of the
[13:35] essential components of Bitcoin and um
[13:39] it because of the ambiguity of the word
[13:42] work you can use it as an anology also
[13:46] for how we act with each other and I
[13:48] think
[13:49] that's also creating a beautiful a ethos
[13:53] in in in
[13:55] Bitcoin of how we are incentivized to
[13:58] Tre each other through the protocol and
[14:01] how it how the protocol works and
[14:04] operates yeah it's also like so
[14:06] beautiful because um whenever we do a
[14:09] lot of stuff I get the comments like
[14:12] when when I post all I did today free
[14:14] death and that um again the comments
[14:17] proof of work and it kind of is the meme
[14:19] for hard work and for putting in the
[14:22] actual proof that you did something and
[14:25] not just take a took a short term like
[14:27] it's even a shortcut it's it's even like
[14:30] um more than just um like Bitcoin of
[14:33] course you need proof work to to get
[14:35] decentralization it's uh it's it's to as
[14:38] you said it's defending the
[14:41] centralization it's defending uh the
[14:45] centralization against the coming and
[14:47] coming and and growing and grow
[14:50] decentralization and uh what what would
[14:52] you say is like when when we zoom out in
[14:55] like 10 20 years um how does does how
[14:59] does it does the world look like if
[15:01] Bitcoin is successful like how does how
[15:04] would you say in 10 20 years oh Bitcoin
[15:06] was successful would you say oh Bitcoin
[15:09] is successful in 10 20 50 years if feed
[15:11] is not there anymore is Bitcoin
[15:13] successful even if Bitcoin if Fe is
[15:16] still there but Bitcoin is just at a
[15:18] such high price and it's everywhere used
[15:20] and you can spend it everywhere how what
[15:23] what would you say is Bitcoin success in
[15:25] like 20
[15:27] years I think will go faster than that
[15:30] actually but um we can come back to that
[15:32] later um I think U Bitcoin is successful
[15:36] as is it adopted as a store of value
[15:40] because it is happening right now um it
[15:44] is distributed as a store value and uh
[15:47] as soon it becomes the main store of
[15:49] value then um um it also starts to eat
[15:54] up all stores of value so right now we
[15:58] have have uh lots of artificial stores
[16:01] of
[16:02] value which don't actually represent uh
[16:06] human potential energy and uh Bitcoin is
[16:09] the perfect representation of human
[16:11] potential energy and um um it is I think
[16:16] from the moment that it is accepted as
[16:19] uh uh the main store of value of human
[16:24] potential energy
[16:26] worldwide Bitcoin will have uh won its
[16:29] place and um what you'll see happen is
[16:33] that um incentives take over so the
[16:36] paradigm shift is the thing that's
[16:39] happening
[16:41] um people will start making different
[16:43] choices based on what kind of money
[16:46] they're they're using to
[16:48] transact um so that also means that um
[16:54] it is more uh beneficial to actually
[16:59] respect each other and just trade
[17:01] instead of trying to take uh in uh
[17:05] whatever form is possible and it will
[17:09] make unaffordable all kinds of policy
[17:12] that um
[17:14] required um money to enforce that wasn't
[17:18] there in the
[17:21] system so uh a lot of things will change
[17:24] and and uh I'm looking forward mostly to
[17:28] the to the real cruelty in the world
[17:31] that um um isn't televised and that is
[17:35] uh the poverty line for the global
[17:37] population uh um when you look at uh uh
[17:41] Africa as a continent so many so many
[17:43] countries are struggling to provide the
[17:47] uh the necessity for um uh a fruitful
[17:51] life for the for its
[17:53] citizens and the people themselves have
[17:55] no no power over their own situation
[17:57] they have no ability to get out of this
[18:00] and uh Bitcoin is going to change this
[18:02] and and I'm looking forward to them just
[18:05] leap frogging all of the uh all of those
[18:08] necessities and coming coming back to or
[18:12] coming back coming finally coming to a
[18:14] situation where they're able to build
[18:17] something for
[18:19] themselves and to become uh because
[18:23] Bitcoin just ends
[18:26] protectionism um even though countries
[18:28] can still uh believe in their ideology
[18:32] of protectionism it doesn't matter
[18:34] Bitcoin doesn't care so Bitcoin is just
[18:36] going to incentivize companies to go
[18:38] look for a Workforce that is cheaper
[18:40] elsewhere and if they don't their
[18:42] competition will so this this Inc
[18:46] incentive structure will make sure that
[18:48] people who are um um who can compete in
[18:53] the labor market will start to compete
[18:56] in the labor market and um
[18:59] it is the
[19:01] permissionless jurisdictions nature of
[19:03] Bitcoin that uh makes this possible uh
[19:07] and I think that is inevitable if if uh
[19:11] things just keep progressing the way
[19:13] they are then we're going to see a a
[19:16] huge inflow of uh people from all over
[19:21] the world into labor markets especially
[19:25] uh online labor markets um and and
[19:30] um I think that's the the thing I'm
[19:32] looking forward most most of all because
[19:34] that brings Capital into those countries
[19:37] so that uh they can actually afford the
[19:39] food that they uh that they need um and
[19:44] um and you talked about Pro
[19:47] protectionism what what what is
[19:49] protectionism what are you talking about
[19:52] government's borders protecting their uh
[19:56] yeah their borders or what what do you
[19:58] mean with prot protectionism yeah
[19:59] protectionism is a a form of
[20:01] interventionism um that's um a policy by
[20:05] a country and it's by ideology um
[20:09] thinking that protecting the um the
[20:13] internal trade structures or the
[20:15] internal um Financial structures of a
[20:18] country is important and you can do this
[20:21] by issuing policy so monetary policy is
[20:24] a form of
[20:25] protectionism um um uh Customs protect
[20:28] ing the borders against uh uh illegal
[20:31] streams of uh of products coming into
[20:34] the country protecting yourself uh thus
[20:38] from um from cheap Chinese labor for
[20:41] example um but also um uh patent
[20:46] structures so uh intellectual property
[20:48] is a form of protectionism um
[20:52] um there are countries that are already
[20:56] rebounding on this the they are uh for
[20:59] example in China there's there's no real
[21:02] uh um effective enforcement of uh uh P
[21:08] patents so you
[21:11] see um factories
[21:14] produce um products that are supposed to
[21:18] be copyright protected or or uh
[21:21] trademark
[21:22] protected um and you can't as a consumer
[21:26] you can't even tell the difference uh
[21:29] between these
[21:30] products um so it's already happening
[21:33] and I think this is just something that
[21:36] Bitcoin um enhances catalyzes and um
[21:41] we'll see real competition and
[21:45] um um this is also something that I've
[21:48] learned from uh reading Human Action by
[21:50] lud for mises is um you can you can
[21:55] create policy but the policy doesn't
[21:58] stop the Human Action from
[22:00] happening the Human Action is just
[22:02] adapting to the new situation where the
[22:04] policy is enforced and whenever you
[22:07] create a policy that isn't enforced
[22:09] you're actually not stopping any of the
[22:11] behavior of individuals leading to
[22:14] Collective
[22:18] choices that's that's some line yeah
[22:21] well
[22:23] um the thing that just came up in my
[22:25] mind and it's it's it's like a small
[22:27] idea in that um people are getting
[22:30] really frustrated online if someone else
[22:33] copies their
[22:35] meme this is something for for example I
[22:38] run the thing that no matter what I
[22:41] produce online just take it like do do
[22:45] with it whatever you want I cannot stop
[22:47] you anyways and I don't care uh and if
[22:50] you take my video I'm in that so you're
[22:53] making advertisement for me so I'm I'm
[22:55] okay with that so I on YouTube there's a
[22:57] tool where you can see
[22:59] uh where your um what channels do your
[23:03] uh videos use and what percentage of
[23:05] your videos are in there there's a high
[23:07] percentage of people that are just
[23:08] copying that and putting on their own
[23:11] channels I thankful for that because
[23:13] they're making advertisement for me they
[23:15] they bringing my name and Bitcoin out
[23:18] there but there are people that are
[23:20] really frustrated and then also really
[23:23] even angry if if someone takes some his
[23:27] work and just distribut as it would be
[23:29] their own is this also um um what you
[23:34] mean with protectionism will will fall
[23:37] down more and more because it's more
[23:38] about the idea it's more about uh what
[23:41] the actual thing is and not about who
[23:44] who did it take
[23:47] credits yes I wholeheartedly agree with
[23:50] your stance on this uh I think um it is
[23:54] exactly like you say um if you want to
[23:58] get your message across then that was
[24:00] your OB objective and if other people
[24:03] start echoing your message without
[24:05] crediting you you've still achieved your
[24:07] your goal which is to to get the message
[24:09] out and for Bitcoin for Bitcoin it's
[24:12] really easy we just want want Bitcoin to
[24:15] be um uh better known uh we we want to
[24:19] educate people which is also in the
[24:22] white white white paper one of the core
[24:25] principles mentioned in the white paper
[24:28] is to to educate each other and um um
[24:33] the ego has no place in education we
[24:36] just need to um bring the message across
[24:40] across the best way we can and uh that
[24:42] has nothing to do with any intellectual
[24:44] property especially when it when when
[24:47] it's about Bitcoin because bit Bitcoin
[24:50] uh is behaving like it's something that
[24:51] we can all use uh permissionless and um
[24:55] there is no there's no ownership of
[24:57] Bitcoin the NW work there's only
[24:59] ownership of
[25:01] Satoshi yeah totally agreed and this is
[25:03] also a reason why I have this speed
[25:05] there because sometimes in my podcast I
[25:08] talk about completely other stuff like I
[25:11] I just I will uh release today a podcast
[25:13] about CH editing uh he's also bitcoiner
[25:16] he I love him uh but he's also talking
[25:20] about Gene editing he wrote the book
[25:22] about that and he he says how bad it is
[25:25] when we mess with our own jeans and how
[25:28] detrimental that could be in our future
[25:31] which has in theory nothing to do with
[25:33] Bitcoin and I will release clips about
[25:36] that uh but even if the clips are not
[25:39] about Bitcoin at all there's still this
[25:41] be in my background and it's still gets
[25:44] a message across so so was important for
[25:47] me because some just have their own
[25:49] signs I could also have a robin s sign
[25:51] in in the background here uh but why
[25:54] it's my face anyway so uh and this is
[25:57] something uh what what I thought about
[26:00] when I designed the background for for
[26:03] me I was like I have to have a Bitcoin
[26:05] thing in there like I'm I'm really um
[26:09] careful with what I spend money on I
[26:11] film on my phone I don't didn't even
[26:14] invest in the camera uh and just
[26:17] yesterday someone asked me oh what
[26:19] camera do you use yeah I use my phone I
[26:22] just put it on a stand and go with
[26:25] it like the the the the phones today are
[26:28] as good as the good cameras 10 years ago
[26:30] so like why why should we use a camera
[26:33] and yeah this is why I have this one on
[26:36] um but let's go back to the poverty line
[26:39] I think it's really interesting what you
[26:40] said and because a lot of people have
[26:42] the stands Bitcoin is just money it will
[26:43] not change a lot in in the uh in the in
[26:47] the greatest feere and I wholeheartedly
[26:50] disagree with that stand and I think you
[26:52] also do um as you said uh with the
[26:55] poverty line and how Bitcoin will change
[26:57] that
[26:58] um maybe let's go into that like how
[27:01] will Bitcoin change the world if it's
[27:05] just money because I hear that a lot oh
[27:07] it's just money how will how will it
[27:09] change
[27:11] anything well many things uh
[27:15] change um from a monetary policy point
[27:18] of view you see that right now um um
[27:22] interest rates are determined for
[27:25] countries on loans that they um have
[27:28] collected over the or loans that have
[27:31] been issued to those countries over the
[27:34] over the course of U 80 years or
[27:38] something um for example the the central
[27:42] uh um African Republic of Congo is still
[27:47] paying for a loan that uh its dictator
[27:50] in
[27:51] 1962
[27:53] utu um got and the interest rate of that
[27:58] uh um loan has been renegotiated every
[28:01] time um the the Central African Republic
[28:04] defaulted on it and um the the problem
[28:09] with those interest rates is that
[28:11] they're higher than the the um the
[28:14] potential growth of those uh countries
[28:17] so if if you uh have uh a negative real
[28:22] rate in a country it is extremely
[28:26] difficult to get out of that you need
[28:27] you you need everybody to be as
[28:30] productive as they can to reach their
[28:32] Highest Potential to to outgrow this uh
[28:36] negative real yield to create a real
[28:38] yield but you're competing with
[28:40] countries that have a pos positive real
[28:43] yields because of policy because they
[28:45] have lower interest rates that are
[28:47] determined by um the issuers of of those
[28:51] loans so right now we we see a financial
[28:57] uh slavery
[28:58] structure that is uh just
[29:02] keeping uh the largest part of the world
[29:05] world population um um under the thumb
[29:09] and
[29:10] um uh Bitcoin will simply CH change this
[29:13] because those loans won't matter anymore
[29:18] the these people are going to be freed
[29:20] from those stupid
[29:22] loans not only is financial repression
[29:25] through inflation doing that right now
[29:28] but uh um hopefully they can shift uh to
[29:34] uh a different money standard and then
[29:36] uh get out of it and
[29:39] um um so that's that's one way and um
[29:44] and and it is this is in consideration
[29:46] that we we talk about all kinds of m
[29:49] misery in the world um but the real
[29:52] misery is
[29:54] hunger and this affects uh
[29:58] 100 million people every
[30:01] year um and um the fatality rate from
[30:05] Hunger is the is is I think the main
[30:09] factor we need to combat and I think uh
[30:13] Bitcoin is going for
[30:16] that so this is if you if you ask me
[30:19] what is the moral case for for Bitcoin I
[30:22] would I would say it is to solve world
[30:26] hunger um
[30:28] and it is by giving access to Capital to
[30:34] people who don't reasonably have access
[30:37] to Capital At This Moment 21 Bitcoin is
[30:40] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[30:44] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[30:47] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[30:49] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[30:52] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[30:55] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[30:58] support this podcast use code Robin and
[31:01] click the link in the description it's
[31:03] amazing bit Bitcoin uh I think if if you
[31:06] say someone that Bitcoin is uh
[31:11] um have like Bitcoin will save world
[31:14] hunger like Bitcoin will not save combat
[31:17] world hunger uh they will call you crazy
[31:20] at first but if you actually do the hard
[31:22] work and you research about Bitcoin and
[31:23] you know how it will impact the world
[31:25] then all of the suddenly makes sense um
[31:28] the question that you also uh teased
[31:30] before that you think it will go faster
[31:33] than than the 10 20 years I mentioned um
[31:37] how fast do you think this transition to
[31:39] bitcoin the Bitcoin standard to bitcoin
[31:42] being the main store of value uh can
[31:46] go so um I read this book when money
[31:51] dies by Adam Ferguson and it's really
[31:54] dry and people people like the book when
[31:56] once they've completed it but they
[31:57] absolutely hate reading it because it's
[31:59] so dry but um I I plowed through it
[32:02] because I thought it was a essential
[32:05] reading for for me to learn uh about
[32:09] Bitcoin and to learn about um the
[32:13] opposite of
[32:14] Bitcoin and um in it in in in this book
[32:18] uh Adam Ferguson describes how the
[32:21] papier Mark inar in the viar Republic uh
[32:24] uh depreciated over a course of six
[32:26] years and when you see the the graph and
[32:30] I'll send you the graph so you can add
[32:31] it in the show
[32:33] notes um you see that uh the currency
[32:37] basically from the onset of super
[32:39] inflation which is inflation above 10%
[32:42] um uh has five years where it spirals
[32:46] out of control and hits the ASM toote of
[32:49] complete uh
[32:51] devaluation uh
[32:53] hyperinflation complete hyper inflation
[32:56] and um
[32:59] I started to think about and I heard
[33:02] Luke Romans once say uh in a podcast
[33:05] that every every currency in the world
[33:08] has uh collapsed at some point um uh
[33:13] which kind of makes sense when you uh
[33:15] look at look at the history of uh um
[33:18] monetary development and um so I decided
[33:22] to uh ask CH GPT about this
[33:26] um um how how
[33:29] quickly uh on average a
[33:32] currency uh collapses from the onset of
[33:36] uh super inflation and it gives you the
[33:39] answer uh five years so some some
[33:44] currencies go a bit quicker as in three
[33:49] years uh and some like Japan are 20
[33:53] years in and not even close to
[33:56] collapsing but it is
[33:59] not uh all the same for every currency
[34:02] because Japan has a lot of us treasuries
[34:05] has the US dollar to lean on um is a a
[34:09] very productive country country still
[34:11] and is innovating to become even more
[34:13] productive has a a very very tough work
[34:16] ethos the people are are are extremely
[34:20] diligent and um um they they still have
[34:25] uh access to Capital I mean there's uh
[34:27] plenty of investment and this is also a
[34:30] side effect of their monetary policy is
[34:33] that other countries can come in and
[34:35] because the Japanese yen is so low they
[34:37] can still invest in it uh they can they
[34:40] can make uh better profits by investing
[34:43] in in uh Japan's industrial um um uh
[34:48] Innovation uh
[34:51] development but
[34:53] um when you look at the current
[34:56] situation for the dollar the dollar
[34:58] doesn't have anything to lean
[35:00] on so the onset of super inflation was
[35:06] um
[35:08] 2021 and uh I'm not talking CPI I'm
[35:12] talking the real inflation and uh
[35:15] considering that the uh papier Mark in
[35:19] uh Germany was uh the the calculation
[35:23] done for that was done with a different
[35:26] method of calculation than we use now
[35:28] for the CPI I think the uh if you if you
[35:32] keep uh messing with the denominator
[35:34] when calculating then uh you're you're
[35:37] not really calculating anything and
[35:39] you're not uh yeah you're you're not
[35:42] doing any research so the CPI is really
[35:45] a it's a
[35:46] joke if you if you consider what the
[35:48] real
[35:49] inflation um must be I don't think you
[35:53] can get an exact number but you can get
[35:55] an estimation and um I
[35:58] uh I think we've seen uh two and a half
[36:01] years of uh peaks of hyperinflation
[36:05] above 20% and um peaks of super
[36:08] inflation and then a moderate um super
[36:13] inflation uh tendency over those years
[36:16] and
[36:18] um the Central Bank policy not being
[36:22] able to control this shows that we can
[36:25] only go up in infl
[36:28] numbers so
[36:30] um comparing these numbers and seeing
[36:35] the um empirical evidence of currencies
[36:39] collapsing with uh
[36:42] within uh an an average amount of five
[36:46] years I think right now we are three
[36:48] three years away from a total collapse
[36:51] of the of the dollar um it's just my
[36:53] estimation based on these on these
[36:56] findings and and um um I think we're
[36:59] going into um next year we're going to
[37:02] see um um more uh peaks of
[37:10] hyperinflation and um the year after
[37:13] we're going to see even higher peaks of
[37:16] hyperinflation and um when you look at
[37:18] the graph um in the from the book you
[37:22] see also the percentual change of the
[37:24] gold price in Pap Mark and this you can
[37:28] just overlay with uh with Bitcoin
[37:32] because um Bitcoin is the escape that
[37:35] gold was for the Germans at that time
[37:39] and you see that the upswings are in the
[37:41] range of 20 to
[37:44] 80% sometimes even
[37:47] 120% uh and the the the downd draws are
[37:50] never more than 20% so you have plenty
[37:53] of downd draws because and
[37:55] and why these Dow draws happen is be
[37:59] because liquidations happen people um uh
[38:03] people sell large large amounts of gold
[38:06] in one go um that collapses the the the
[38:09] gold price relative to the to the papier
[38:12] Mark
[38:14] um um at some moments in time but
[38:17] overall you see that even though it's
[38:20] highly volatile the movement is
[38:23] exponential so the
[38:25] average um up swing is exponential and
[38:30] and this is what I'm uh I think we'll
[38:32] see happen with Bitcoin also uh
[38:36] especially because uh on a short
[38:39] term gold scarcity nears absolute
[38:43] scarcity on the longer term it doesn't
[38:45] and
[38:46] Bitcoin because it is absolute scarcity
[38:50] there's there's no reason to take into
[38:52] account that it is just scarce it is
[38:55] absolutely scarce so the
[38:57] once once there's no way to buy Bitcoin
[39:02] in effect the price is infinite if it is
[39:06] not for sale for any currency that means
[39:09] that the price is infinite and this is
[39:12] this is what you see in this uh in this
[39:14] graph of wmart
[39:16] Germany where um it is the the the
[39:22] uh the hyperinflation hyperinflation
[39:26] nears an Asm toote
[39:28] where there is just no uh no bid nobody
[39:32] wants the money anymore it's uh it's
[39:35] completely worthless and that's if when
[39:39] that happens to a currency then the
[39:41] thing that actually has value in the
[39:43] case of B why my Germany it's gold in
[39:46] the case uh of the dollar now it's
[39:48] Bitcoin you'll you'll see that the price
[39:50] is
[39:52] infinite that doesn't mean that the
[39:54] value is infinite the the value is
[39:56] divided over for all other value
[39:58] exchanged for it or exchangeable for
[40:01] it what do you think the the value will
[40:04] be then for Bitcoin can can you buy with
[40:07] one Bitcoin like 10 houses
[40:11] or because then we cannot compare it to
[40:14] our usual right now unitive account with
[40:17] the US Dollars Euro whatever you use um
[40:20] so for imagining how big Bitcoin will be
[40:24] I'm always trying to figure out like uh
[40:27] how how many houses can you buy for one
[40:28] Bitcoin how many uh what what what will
[40:32] one Bitcoin and I think one Bitcoin will
[40:33] be massive to have because when you
[40:36] think about uh the whole world going on
[40:38] this Bitcoin standard and there's only
[40:40] 21 million but really there are way less
[40:42] than 21 million uh and how many people
[40:45] there are how many millionaires there
[40:47] are how many rich people there are that
[40:49] actually have a lot of money and can
[40:51] move into this uh what what do you think
[40:54] will be like um a size comparison listen
[40:57] to one Bitcoin in this next five 10
[41:01] years you're talking about or next three
[41:03] five years you actually talked about I
[41:06] think it's very difficult to really
[41:07] assess uh
[41:10] um a a
[41:12] good uh exchange
[41:14] rate I think it is um the best way to
[41:19] look at uh bitcoin's value overall by
[41:22] comparing house prices to to to bitcoin
[41:25] for this for this example
[41:28] but I think we're going to see
[41:32] um
[41:34] um a a rough estimate would be um um
[41:39] dollar sat parity so that is for today's
[41:43] dollars Satoshi and it and um how
[41:47] quickly this is going to happen is
[41:50] impossible to say but um
[41:53] um it denominated in in dollars Bitcoin
[41:57] is is is
[41:58] going uh obviously to Infinity so it
[42:02] it's going to go through that number but
[42:04] um in buying power in in real buying
[42:07] power I I think uh dollar set parity of
[42:11] today's dollars is is a good uh estimate
[42:15] for where we can be in uh three to five
[42:19] years yeah and then the the logical step
[42:22] once you realize that is to adopt the
[42:25] Bitcoin standard and uh for for me uh
[42:30] Bitcoin standard means that you have
[42:33] only Bitcoin at this point in time uh
[42:36] but I also acknowledge that there is
[42:39] life situations for uh different people
[42:42] um for example if you are a dad of fre
[42:46] kids and you have maybe even a company
[42:48] running um it's hard to be all in in
[42:52] Bitcoin because you need operational
[42:54] money you need to feed a family and uh
[42:58] as you said Bitcoin can be really
[43:00] volatile so uh you don't want to be
[43:02] forced into selling uh some of your
[43:05] stack at bare Market low uh so I'm
[43:10] always encouraging people to like have
[43:12] as much Bitcoin as they can possibly
[43:14] have in in their financial situation and
[43:16] this is like different to everyone um so
[43:20] it's not really like go all in because
[43:23] it's the best thing I'm all in but it's
[43:25] not the best way for everybody
[43:27] um uh but there's also more to it to do
[43:30] adopting a Bitcoin standard adopting a
[43:32] Bitcoin standard means also uh you have
[43:35] to take uh responsibility of your keys
[43:38] you have to take
[43:40] responsibility uh and maybe even drive
[43:42] Bitcoin adoption to a certain extent try
[43:45] to figure out ways to spend Bitcoin and
[43:48] not spend dollars try to figure out ways
[43:51] to maybe even get paid in Bitcoin uh I
[43:54] mean this is going beyond the the normal
[43:58] uh uh thing how far would you say you
[44:01] personally are on a Bitcoin
[44:05] standard um my income is from uh real
[44:09] estate and um I I am not in a position
[44:13] to uh to to sell uh all of that uh to
[44:18] buy Bitcoin with uh because I have a
[44:21] family and uh need to take care of them
[44:24] um so that's a limit on my capability um
[44:28] and um also because of the um
[44:33] the uh total Finance uh aspect of this
[44:39] uh real estate deal um I have to receive
[44:43] it in euros and uh uh I can later
[44:47] convert into Bitcoin whatever I think is
[44:51] uh um uh wise but um I I can't receive
[44:55] in Bitcoin at the at the moment because
[44:57] I I'm not um sure enough um how I end
[45:02] up um at the end of the
[45:06] year but um um yeah I I would say I'm um
[45:11] I I have very little liquidity in
[45:15] anything but Bitcoin so uh every every
[45:19] uh thing I would normally have saved in
[45:22] Euros I'm immediately converting to uh
[45:25] to bitcoin and um
[45:29] um I think this is this is this is the
[45:31] way forward for me and uh I don't advise
[45:36] people to do this I I tend to be more
[45:39] conservative when when advising people I
[45:42] just tell them uh at least to get some
[45:46] and uh uh usually um I um convince them
[45:52] by saying there is a cost of opportunity
[45:54] and and uh an asymmetry in uh what
[45:58] Bitcoin is doing and if you don't play
[46:01] you lose there's a massive actually cost
[46:05] of opportunity and I think this is a
[46:07] really good approach because um what we
[46:10] are talking about and this big deers and
[46:12] where Bitcoin is going I think it can
[46:14] scare people off uh if they don't have
[46:17] any Bitcoin knowledge or little to know
[46:19] Bitcoin knowledge some Bitcoin knowledge
[46:21] everybody has but most of that is coming
[46:24] from Reading headlines um so so I'm
[46:27] always also trying to convince them like
[46:30] get something like even like even if you
[46:33] can afford like 100 of Bitcoin uh get it
[46:36] and and see where it goes and then then
[46:39] educate yourself in Bitcoin use Bitcoin
[46:42] try to get it from exchange to a
[46:43] hardware wallet like just play around
[46:46] with it get comfortable with it and once
[46:49] you have it and once you are comfortable
[46:51] with it once you got educated on it uh
[46:53] with with books with podcasts with
[46:55] whatever uh then you can move uh further
[46:57] in that um what what's interesting for
[47:00] me is also then uh we have a euro dollar
[47:04] collapsing but then there's something
[47:07] new coming up which is not really new in
[47:09] my opinion uh but people say it's new
[47:12] it's cbdcs uh for me cbdc is a little
[47:15] bit like Blu-ray the new techn the
[47:19] better technology is actually coming
[47:20] right around the the corner and Blu-ray
[47:22] is this thing uh experts Finance experts
[47:26] are now saying oh it's great what do you
[47:29] see like what impact do you see cbdcs
[47:32] having in the adoption of
[47:34] Bitcoin I think your Blu-ray example is
[47:38] is really funny yeah um um I think um
[47:42] cbdcs are making it themselves
[47:48] irrelevant
[47:50] um because um people will um value more
[47:57] uh uh an appreciating buying power and
[48:01] they're they're going to see people lead
[48:04] by example that are in
[48:07] Bitcoin um parallel to this cbdc system
[48:11] and I I think we're going to see the
[48:13] digital Europe in Euro in in Europe
[48:15] because the ECB is just adamant about uh
[48:19] um developing it I think they even have
[48:22] a date for it to start issuing I thought
[48:25] it was late 26
[48:27] or uh um or a year later but um if you
[48:32] go to the website of the ECB they uh
[48:34] they are um really enthusiastic about it
[48:38] I I think it just
[48:40] shows that they are not willing to do
[48:43] any of the work and they're dismissing
[48:47] arguments uh by people who have um
[48:50] written extensively about this um you
[48:54] can't create a money uh um out of thin
[48:58] air you cannot what we have with the
[49:01] Euro right now is based on confidence
[49:03] this confidence is already there before
[49:06] they went off of any
[49:08] standard and um if you issue a new coin
[49:14] then you can't uh um expect that to hold
[49:19] value over time
[49:23] um uh because it's because it's entirely
[49:26] new
[49:27] people won't appreciate it for uh for
[49:30] any of its
[49:33] um um properties if it's not uh linked
[49:38] to an underlying
[49:40] asset um people are just not that stupid
[49:43] I think and
[49:46] um um so at the same time Bitcoin is
[49:49] going to be parallel to that and it's
[49:51] just going to show
[49:53] uh uh that it does have the the the
[49:57] value propositions correct and
[50:02] um um we can we can see this play out in
[50:07] real time in Nigeria they have the the
[50:10] naira which is being
[50:13] replaced uh by the
[50:15] enira uh and I think this is a pilot by
[50:19] uh other other Central central banks
[50:22] being uh uh influencing Nigeria to do
[50:26] this as a as a as a experiment but I
[50:30] don't know but you see that uh the the
[50:32] tendency of the the population is uh not
[50:37] to use the enira and to uh to use cash
[50:42] instead and uh um people are stubborn
[50:45] and I think especially when you look at
[50:47] Merchants Merchants make up uh uh the
[50:51] the local
[50:52] economy Merchants aren't going to uh um
[50:56] um accept uh uh a digital Euro in Europe
[51:01] just because the Central Bank says
[51:03] that's the money they are always
[51:07] considering different payment methods uh
[51:10] they always have reason to and um now
[51:14] for example the um cash is is be
[51:18] becoming more popular again uh um simply
[51:23] because they are trying to cope and um
[51:27] uh cash makes makes your bookkeeping a
[51:30] little bit more easy as a merchant so
[51:32] you have a little bit more flexibility
[51:34] of what you actually pay in
[51:36] taxes
[51:39] um um which may be fraud but it you
[51:43] can't stop uh people from trying to
[51:46] cope uh this is uh this is simply not
[51:50] enforceable and and that's that's a
[51:53] problem that a cbdc has in the end you
[51:55] create a policy
[51:57] that you coarse onto people but the the
[52:00] reaction is Human Action so people will
[52:05] still make individual choices based on
[52:08] uh
[52:09] uh their own situation and uh they're
[52:13] going to choose what's best for them not
[52:16] what's best for the digital naira or the
[52:18] digital Euro uh or the central bank no
[52:22] they're just going to make their own
[52:23] choices and uh um
[52:27] I think we
[52:28] will uh see it immediately when when
[52:31] they start to issue these uh these cbdcs
[52:34] so I'm I mean they can they can force an
[52:37] account on me but I'm I'm never going to
[52:39] spend any digital Euro I'm never going
[52:42] to do it because it's just doesn't make
[52:44] any
[52:45] sense yeah and I think I I looked it up
[52:49] while you were speaking it's actually
[52:50] late 2026 as you said uh that they start
[52:53] issuing it and uh I think with every
[52:57] government
[52:58] project it might be late might be later
[53:01] than that let's see and uh I don't know
[53:04] I never saw a a successful technical
[53:06] solution from any government I see like
[53:10] it's not possible in Austria to like
[53:12] found a company online and stuff like
[53:15] that and I all tried the this out and
[53:17] and it's it's horrible it's it's it's
[53:20] it's you have to go to the physical
[53:23] government offices so many times because
[53:25] stuff is not working out it's like it's
[53:28] so [ __ ] H so I'm I'm I'm I'm looking
[53:31] forward to the the Technical Solutions
[53:33] and the technical problems they are
[53:35] having and how far ahead Bitcoin will be
[53:39] in that adoption curve because uh it's
[53:41] already so good and think just like
[53:45] three years out how far further Bitcoin
[53:50] um payments and Bitcoin apps and wallets
[53:54] and usability and user friendly apps
[53:56] will be because so much money will come
[53:59] in the space it it will be uh
[54:02] everybody's like why should I use that
[54:04] digital
[54:06] Euro it it has maybe spending limits it
[54:10] has this and that and it's it's it has
[54:13] all the problems uh of the old world and
[54:17] none of the advantages of
[54:19] Bitcoin it's really [ __ ] but yeah I
[54:22] don't know there's also this this thing
[54:24] like they can uh like did did you saw
[54:27] the thing with the world coin how many
[54:29] people lined up for that thing like they
[54:34] they can have crazy incentives maybe
[54:36] that people get into that I don't know
[54:38] like there was there was some countries
[54:40] giving up free giving up free burgers
[54:42] for vaccination vaccination
[54:45] vaccinations uh and it's like people
[54:47] actually took on this this this thing
[54:49] and I don't know I don't know how they
[54:52] will implement it and and giving
[54:53] incentives for people to to get it but
[54:56] it will be interesting to see I think
[54:58] you can I think you can always negotiate
[55:02] with uh consumers and find ways to
[55:05] convince them without real
[55:08] coercive well well you would be coercing
[55:11] but you're only coursing them through
[55:15] false uh uh false incentives and uh
[55:20] uh uh false
[55:22] motivation but I think you can't do this
[55:25] with merchants Merchants are a different
[55:28] kind of people and uh they make up uh a
[55:31] smaller percentage of the world uh of
[55:33] the of the population and um these
[55:36] people are looking for profit and you
[55:39] can't you can't convince them to uh
[55:43] start using uh a new accountant method
[55:47] just because uh someone says you should
[55:52] they are they are going to look for the
[55:55] why and they're going to find out with
[55:58] the cbdc that the Y is actually really
[56:00] horrible and uh
[56:03] um uh there's I don't think that's um I
[56:09] I think by that fact alone uh
[56:13] um cbdcs are are doomed to fail from the
[56:17] from the uh from the
[56:19] start I also think that
[56:23] um cbdcs could be kind of uh trojen
[56:28] horse for mainstream for Bitcoin because
[56:30] then governments say oh this digital
[56:33] thing this digital wallet has
[56:35] value uh and it's and it gets more and
[56:39] more approved uh in society with the
[56:41] government saying this digital wallet
[56:43] this digital thing has value then people
[56:45] are like but what is with Bitcoin
[56:47] because my digital Euro loses in value
[56:49] and all of a sudden this digital Bitcoin
[56:52] uh wins in value so I don't know uh how
[56:55] how this will all play out there are a
[56:57] lot of interesting theories around that
[56:59] uh but in the end of the day uh no
[57:01] matter what impact cbdcs has on bitcoin
[57:04] Bitcoin will win long term I think this
[57:06] is the the important message to to to
[57:09] take and I think it's it's in such an
[57:11] amazing time to be alive right now it's
[57:14] it's such an interesting thing uh like
[57:17] so many interesting things are happening
[57:19] uh and yeah that's that's why I have
[57:22] this podcast I have 300 people per year
[57:25] on as I want to have three bit 300
[57:28] bitcoiners on this year and exactly
[57:31] because of that reason uh because I want
[57:33] to document I want to speak with
[57:35] everyone it's like having a podcast in
[57:37] 1995 and seeing the internet growing uh
[57:40] this would been amazing to have and I
[57:42] want to just do this for for
[57:45] Bitcoin yeah perfect um we're coming
[57:48] slow slow slowly to to the end of the
[57:50] podcast and I was uh Curious and I'm
[57:54] always curious about those kind of
[57:55] questions
[57:56] um what is your most controversial
[57:59] Bitcoin take what what would you say is
[58:01] your take on bitcoin that or not even on
[58:05] bitcoin it can be on on on other stuff
[58:07] but what would be the take that most
[58:10] bitcoiners would disagree with
[58:13] um what I hear a lot of bitcoiners say
[58:16] is that Bitcoin doesn't scale and that
[58:18] there's no solution for
[58:20] it and uh I my thoughts are contrary to
[58:24] that I think that's a malthusian
[58:25] argument
[58:27] I think Bitcoin scales because uh people
[58:30] simply don't understand the amount of
[58:32] money that's going to come into Bitcoin
[58:35] Bitcoin will pay for itself Bitcoin
[58:37] development will pay for itself just by
[58:39] the acre of value of
[58:42] Bitcoin there are Bitcoin bitcoiners who
[58:46] become so filthy rich and they of course
[58:49] are incentivized to uh um use that
[58:53] Capital that new capital that they
[58:55] didn't have before before and now is
[58:57] almost like water to them um and they
[59:00] are going to spend it on bitcoin
[59:02] development and um uh I think this is
[59:06] Gravely underestimated and um um you'll
[59:10] you'll see just like you described
[59:11] before you'll see development of wallets
[59:14] in such such a way that people don't
[59:16] even notice they're using Bitcoin uh and
[59:19] that it's different from uh from
[59:21] anything else the only thing they will
[59:23] notice is that they when they use these
[59:25] units they're going to be better off and
[59:27] especially when looking at each other
[59:29] through uh um
[59:33] um uh role modeling or or uh um leading
[59:37] by example people are going to show that
[59:40] uh using Bitcoin to transact is going to
[59:42] be the best
[59:44] way definitely it's it's it will be so
[59:48] obvious in in in handset and it's it's
[59:50] fun to watch right now uh the whole
[59:53] adoption growing um where uh we have we
[59:56] have an inro team where the previous
[59:58] guest ask a question without knowing who
[60:00] is the next guest uh and your question
[60:04] from the previous guest is uh where do
[60:06] you and we we kind of talked about it
[60:08] today extensively actually and and um
[60:11] but I still want to to ask the question
[60:14] maybe you have like different thing you
[60:16] want to add on that uh where do you see
[60:19] Bitcoin in 10 years I think in 10 years
[60:23] Bitcoin is going to be the uh um the
[60:26] main store value of the world and um
[60:30] it's going to be the U main unit of uh
[60:36] uh account for all international
[60:41] trade and um simply because of its
[60:45] trustless nature really cool yeah
[60:48] perfect that I think this is the perfect
[60:50] way uh to end the prodcast in the
[60:52] perfect uh uh uh ending point to to make
[60:56] a point here um now has it was a
[60:59] pleasure for me to have you uh it was
[61:01] really really cool to talk with you you
[61:03] have really interesting uh thoughts and
[61:06] ideas uh for for Bitcoin I also think
[61:09] that your timeline with like three years
[61:12] to um to to this kind of a Bitcoin
[61:16] adoption as you described it is really
[61:18] interesting to see and I have to think
[61:20] more about it because I always was like
[61:22] it will take more time but it could be
[61:25] really fast as you said it with with the
[61:27] different with the average time of of uh
[61:31] currencies collapsing with
[61:33] hyperinflation um thank you for taking
[61:35] the time thank you for being on uh for
[61:37] people that now want to like ask you
[61:39] questions for people that want to reach
[61:41] out to you uh where can they um reach
[61:44] you the best where can they ask you
[61:47] questions um I'm um on Noster um you can
