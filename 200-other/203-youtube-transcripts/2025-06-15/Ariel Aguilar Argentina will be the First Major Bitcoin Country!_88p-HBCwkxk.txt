[00:00] we have in a month the inflation that
[00:02] regular countries or First World
[00:04] countries have in in a year people
[00:06] started going well into Bitcoin um
[00:09] Argentina will be the first major
[00:11] country to adopt a Bitcoin standard
[00:13] Argentina was full of ridiculous all
[00:16] kinds of laws all kinds of regulations
[00:18] all all kinds of taxes restrictions it
[00:21] was going towards Venezuela if I can
[00:23] freely choose in Austria between having
[00:26] Bitcoin or having Euro as a currency I
[00:28] would choose Bitcoin all the time
[00:30] argentines are suffering a lot like that
[00:32] salary I told you that was
[00:34] $1,000 5 years ago now argentines are
[00:38] making like $300 a month how would you
[00:40] survive with € a day this is the sad
[00:42] story of how Fiat can destroy a nation a
[00:45] lot of Russians now are going to
[00:47] Argentina to have babies and and get an
[00:49] Argentine passport even some Americans
[00:52] are going to Argentina so that that's
[00:53] blowing in my mind like Americans trying
[00:56] to have an Argentine passport last year
[00:58] I went in November and I was able to
[01:00] fill the gas tank of the car for $12 a
[01:03] few months later you would take three
[01:05] times as much dollar 36 to fill the car
[01:07] having to pay three times as much in
[01:09] dollars it's
[01:11] [Music]
[01:13] tough for the today's topic I really
[01:16] want to get into Argentina it's really
[01:18] interesting with with uh chavier Mele I
[01:21] think we all really watch the election
[01:24] of him really really closely after that
[01:26] also a little bit but the focus has
[01:28] drifted away a little bit um but before
[01:31] we get into the current topic uh I think
[01:34] you're also really big on the history of
[01:36] of Argentina and the financial history
[01:38] um maybe for those who are not as aware
[01:41] of the history and and how's Argentina
[01:44] doing and and what they did in the in
[01:45] the past um what were some of the the
[01:48] major events and and what why is
[01:51] Argentina now in the situation it's a
[01:53] really long story I'd say but we should
[01:57] start also considering ARG
[02:00] as a country that became a world
[02:03] superpower around the end of the 19th
[02:06] century beginning of the 20th centur so
[02:09] it was on power with the United States
[02:11] and Canada Australia right but that was
[02:17] accomplished in very few
[02:19] decades Argentina was really poor like
[02:22] in 1810 1820s and so
[02:26] on we saw ourselves as barbar an or
[02:31] Savages very few people knew how to read
[02:33] or
[02:34] write we got independent from the spers
[02:38] but then we started fighting each other
[02:41] over like this centralization or
[02:43] decentralization problems so it's quite
[02:47] funny that we're all on the same topic
[02:49] like how centralized the government
[02:51] should be right but fortunately
[02:54] Argentina had a generation of founding
[02:57] fathers that were classical liberal
[03:01] and they enacted a a classical liberal
[03:04] Constitution 1853 it
[03:07] was and ever since the country started
[03:11] like well recognizing private property
[03:13] rights recognizing that foreigners had
[03:17] the same rights as
[03:18] Citizens and that Argentina was open and
[03:21] welcoming everybody to come and leave
[03:23] like the Argentinian dream let's say oh
[03:25] yeah like Europeans when they were
[03:27] fleeing Europe in the 20 Century well
[03:31] they they they either chose New York or
[03:33] wos
[03:34] ciris as destinations but the thing was
[03:38] in the 20th century Argentina started to
[03:41] change er a lot of poor immigration from
[03:45] Spain and Italy they brought new ideas
[03:48] of well anarch communism communism
[03:51] socialism so we lost by
[03:55] 1930 we started having military coups so
[03:59] no more yeah regular presidents
[04:02] democracy and those military were
[04:05] fascinated with musolini and Hitler
[04:09] right so also five years later they put
[04:13] the First Central Bank
[04:16] 1935 so up until 1935 Argentina did not
[04:20] have a central bank um for some periods
[04:23] we had a gold standard but whenever
[04:26] there was a crisis they would take out
[04:27] the gold standard
[04:30] and also at the same time they
[04:32] established the income tax so it's quite
[04:35] similar to what happened in the United
[04:36] States like 1913 or 1914 they they come
[04:41] together right like Central Bank Plus ER
[04:44] income tax and that income tax was like
[04:48] supposed to be temporary like 10 years
[04:51] and they've been renewing that every 10
[04:54] years right H renewing the the income
[04:57] tax so well the country started on this
[05:00] decline up until there's a breaking
[05:04] point I would say that um General in the
[05:08] military he became minister of
[05:12] Labor Juan Domingo Peron right he
[05:16] perhaps some people have heard about
[05:19] Peron and this military he realized the
[05:23] power of being a populist being like a
[05:27] because has being a minister of labor he
[05:30] had to deal with unions
[05:33] and yeah businessmen and the workers and
[05:37] he realize since we are in a democracy
[05:39] we we can get the votes of the majority
[05:42] and so he started a a peach about yeah
[05:46] workers rights and so
[05:48] on and he got a girlfriend that she was
[05:52] an actress aspiring on the on the apps
[05:56] coming up and aita and she was was like
[06:00] a Moder day so social social justice
[06:05] Warrior
[06:08] right so they partnered together well
[06:10] they want the
[06:12] military at first they triy to stop
[06:15] Pon they put him in jail but eventually
[06:19] aita was on the radio calling from him
[06:23] and so they call elections he won they
[06:26] became presidents and that's when
[06:28] Argentina 19 47 or so started
[06:32] changing they nationalized almost
[06:34] everything became part of the state so
[06:37] the the Central Bank became part of the
[06:39] state the railroads the power
[06:44] generation phone companies Airlines
[06:48] everything became part of the state and
[06:51] there were tales that they say that the
[06:54] Central Bank Isles were so full of gold
[06:57] that you couldn't walk on the aisles
[07:00] right but by the time Peron had finished
[07:03] his or they took him out actually second
[07:06] Monday the the aisles were empty like
[07:10] all the gold was
[07:12] gone
[07:13] so the next few decades were a
[07:16] succession of either democracy onof
[07:20] coming back to military
[07:22] coups up until
[07:25] 1983 so this has been going on from 1930
[07:29] till
[07:30] 1983 and ever since 1970 right around
[07:36] the time the Nixon took us of the gold
[07:39] standard in the dollar Argentina started
[07:42] a monetary disaster because we had the
[07:45] first currency of Argentina was
[07:48] called peso Mona National National
[07:51] currency let's say peso it lasted from
[07:55] 1881 until
[07:58] 1970 but then and I should have it I I
[08:00] always carried with me the bills right
[08:04] the 100 of pesos
[08:06] monal became one peso like a l peso this
[08:11] is a
[08:12] PES and this one lasted 13 years right
[08:18] so we yeah it was it got up to 1 million
[08:22] PES
[08:23] notes and in 83 we did the FK Elance War
[08:29] 82
[08:30] and we lost the war right and so the
[08:33] military were
[08:34] out and they had to take four zeros out
[08:37] of this one so
[08:38] 10,000 of this one
[08:41] became an Argentine peso which is really
[08:43] similar but now it says Argentino here
[08:47] and this one they destroyed in two years
[08:51] total disaster like you make a new
[08:53] currency and it's gone in two years 85
[08:57] right so this was a return to democracy
[09:01] and this guy was left leaning the
[09:04] president yeah from the left he got
[09:08] canian
[09:09] politics so he had to replace the
[09:12] currency and he proposed what was called
[09:14] the austral
[09:16] plan the a new currency and austral
[09:19] comes means from the south like
[09:22] Australia so when this currency was born
[09:25] it was more precious than $1 83 Cent of
[09:29] an austral bought you a
[09:31] lar how many years do you
[09:34] think it took us for to to be in
[09:37] hyperinflation again I mean the the
[09:39] first the two years I guess uh in the
[09:42] similar real well it was four years so
[09:46] 89 by
[09:48] 1989 we were in hyperinflation again
[09:52] destroying this one so the the president
[09:55] that did this they had six sixe terms
[09:58] back then well he called elections in
[10:00] advance to to leave office right the
[10:03] situation was so bad so a new president
[10:07] that came from the political party of
[10:10] Pon right got into power and it's like
[10:14] that political party is the main party
[10:16] now of Argentina right the
[10:19] peronism but
[10:21] peronism doesn't mean actually anything
[10:23] I mean ideologically like it might mean
[10:27] populism but we had periods of time when
[10:31] Peron was a military like fascist and
[10:34] then in the 70s there were peronist
[10:38] Fanatics that were like communist and
[10:42] socialist Advocates and they wanted to
[10:44] replicate Cuba they wanted to have Cuba
[10:47] in Argentina right and they became
[10:50] terrorists in the
[10:53] 70s ER and then this president in
[10:57] 89 he came through the ponist political
[11:01] party but after melee he was the most
[11:04] like libertarian
[11:06] ever so if it wasn't for him we wouldn't
[11:11] be talking about Argentina right now
[11:12] because Argentina would have gone
[11:15] insignificant much sooner like um he
[11:20] opened up the economy we have to
[11:22] also bear in mind that the world was
[11:25] going towards Freedom back then because
[11:27] the Berlin Wall fell in '89 the Soviet
[11:31] Union
[11:33] dissolved fer and ran had lower taxes
[11:36] right and so the sentiment was going
[11:39] towards more freedom and bil Clinton was
[11:44] somewhat not not like the Democrats of
[11:47] today right so he open up the country he
[11:51] privatized all the state
[11:54] companies and and he open Argentina to
[11:56] the world like I sometimes tell that uh
[11:59] for example the cars in Argentina we had
[12:02] the same cars from
[12:04] 1960 so they were still being
[12:06] manufactured in
[12:08] 1991 right cars from
[12:11] 1967 with minor minor modifications
[12:14] right like you change a light and that's
[12:17] it the phones you would have to ask as
[12:21] the state for a phone line it would take
[12:23] like 10 years for the state to install a
[12:27] phone line in your home
[12:29] and when this President privatized it it
[12:33] was just like two days right from so we
[12:35] went from like 10 years to two two days
[12:38] and people so a house with a phone line
[12:42] would be much more valuable than a house
[12:45] without a phone line right ER so so yeah
[12:50] we were isolated we we had from the
[12:53] universities and the media they have
[12:56] always taught us that we have to live
[12:58] with what is ours we have to live within
[13:02] our means of buying Argentine so foreign
[13:06] products were really hard to get right
[13:10] and so when I tell the story I realize
[13:12] oh my God like we were like a Soviet
[13:15] Union
[13:16] country right er no wonder we we started
[13:20] falling down the positions of of
[13:24] countries and relatively yeah we've been
[13:28] getting more and more poor but the '90s
[13:31] this guy this President he said he he
[13:35] established sort of like a usdt a tether
[13:39] because he said whenever the exchange
[13:42] rate between dollars and pesos becomes
[13:47] $110,000
[13:48] Australis right he would kick in
[13:52] convertibility law which is like a peg a
[13:57] one to one so this PES
[14:00] convertible they needed a dollar in the
[14:02] central bank or a treasury bill or
[14:05] whatever in order to print one of these
[14:09] so Argentina self-restricted the money
[14:12] printing this is the only period where
[14:15] we had 10 years of almost practically
[14:18] zero zero inflation no no
[14:20] inflation and that was when I was gr up
[14:23] so that's what I experien prices not
[14:26] changing uh stability the economy for a
[14:30] few periods it was booming like we were
[14:33] growing like at Chinese rates money was
[14:36] flowing the recessions in other
[14:38] countries like Mexico in the 95 and
[14:40] Thailand in or Russia in 99 well they
[14:44] really hit
[14:46] us and this
[14:48] President ER he lasted 10 years in
[14:50] office right ER he even attempted no
[14:56] yeah he he lasted 10 years the next
[14:58] president was was sort of like a
[15:00] Biden right like a Joe Biden he was
[15:03] really old he got lost on
[15:06] stage and that President ER raised
[15:10] taxes
[15:12] and the country went into a recession we
[15:15] couldn't print money so we had to borrow
[15:18] they they they started doing deficit
[15:21] spending well even the the this
[15:24] Libertarian president also did deficit
[15:27] spending but ER eventually we knew that
[15:31] the country was going towards a default
[15:33] we reach a
[15:34] crisis they did um they they they they
[15:38] because they they were the banks were
[15:42] going to implode so they decided okay
[15:46] before this happens we're going to
[15:48] restrict people from taking the money
[15:50] out of the banks right uh you were only
[15:54] allowed $250 a week to withdraw
[15:57] everything else had to stay inside of
[15:59] the banking system everything had to be
[16:02] wire transfer check uh debit cards
[16:05] credit
[16:06] cards so people started rioting people
[16:10] started because they knew they were
[16:12] going to lose all their savings and the
[16:15] president decided to do to do like a
[16:17] curfew at night you couldn't leave your
[16:20] house people rioted even
[16:23] more they were looting people stealing
[16:26] from
[16:27] shops and eventually that President
[16:30] resigned he he he escaped the a
[16:32] helicopter landed on the roof of our
[16:34] White House he escaped through the roof
[16:37] he flew off off we didn't knew where he
[16:40] was going and we had no V Vice President
[16:44] back then he had resigned
[16:47] prior and eventually well we had a
[16:50] succession of
[16:51] presidents and those presidents decided
[16:54] to end the
[16:56] convertibility and H to declare the
[16:59] fault so we were no longer going to pay
[17:01] our debts to anybody and Argentina has
[17:05] been on default like for 15 years ever
[17:09] since we got off default I know like
[17:11] 2015 I'm not sure right but around that
[17:14] time and ever since we started inflating
[17:18] so right now instead of one PES or
[17:22] $1 we need over a th000 pesos for a
[17:27] dollar right
[17:29] so we have already taken 13 zeros out of
[17:33] the currency we should be able to take
[17:37] three more zeros so 16 zeros in
[17:41] total ER and we would be around one to
[17:44] one again so yeah this is why
[17:47] argentine's ER have a yeah disastrous
[17:51] economics they don't trust the banks
[17:53] people don't hold dollars in Banks like
[17:57] if you have know 100,000
[17:59] you're not going to put it in the bank
[18:02] like it has happened many
[18:05] times that that yeah they they will tell
[18:08] you back in 2002 they gave people who
[18:11] had dollars they gave them
[18:14] pesos so if you had $100,000 in the
[18:17] bank after the crisis they would say now
[18:20] you have 140,000 P pesos zero dollar all
[18:25] the dollar bank accounts went to zero
[18:28] for all the country all the companies
[18:30] all the everybody right and they gave
[18:34] you 140,000
[18:36] pesos but the free market exchange rate
[18:39] was 4 to1 so er if you wanted with the
[18:44] 14,000 pesos by back dollars you would
[18:47] get
[18:48] 35,000 right so people lost
[18:52] 65% of all their money in that
[18:55] crisis so from 20 3 Argentina has been
[19:01] on a
[19:02] leftist agenda government raising
[19:06] taxes doing more deficit spending we did
[19:09] sort of a
[19:10] Ubi really early on because we decided
[19:14] to pay for children and pay yeah for a
[19:19] lot of uh disabilities and so on or or
[19:24] unemployed payments so a poor f family
[19:29] they could yeah gather many children and
[19:32] gather many unemployed members
[19:36] and get certified as disabled and so on
[19:39] and they would make much much more money
[19:41] than somebody
[19:43] working and so I I don't have the
[19:47] numbers like on the top of my head but
[19:51] it's something like I know let's say
[19:54] let's say that a third of the population
[19:56] was on welfare a third of the population
[20:00] was
[20:00] working ER in the black market so they
[20:04] don't have a formal job contract and
[20:07] they're not paying taxes and a third of
[20:09] the population is paying taxes
[20:12] supporting the the people on welfare
[20:15] right so yeah it's a whole s
[20:17] unsustainable situation that was paid
[20:20] for by money printing so everybody paid
[20:23] for it through money printing so at
[20:25] first it was like 10% inflation 20 30 40
[20:29] 50 60 70 uh and we reach over 100% a few
[20:35] a few years ago and yeah
[20:38] so I tell you all of these stor so that
[20:40] we can be like in the context of what
[20:42] the Argentine situation is and and to
[20:45] see why argentine's for example we
[20:48] really got into Bitcoin and and
[20:50] understood the need for it really early
[20:54] like 2013 2014 Argentina
[20:57] was had a lot of bitcoiners right um we
[21:02] had exchange
[21:03] controls like from 2011 so we we were
[21:06] not able to freely buy a dollars with
[21:11] our pesos right so Argentina is used to
[21:15] having
[21:17] a informal operations we could call it
[21:20] black market operations but the whole
[21:23] country operates in the black market
[21:26] everybody right
[21:28] even the politicians the businessmen the
[21:31] families the poor
[21:33] people they go to Aqua Aqua is a cave in
[21:39] in in Spanish it's a any kind of place
[21:42] that sells you and buys dollars and
[21:45] pesos right and it could be any it could
[21:47] be a restaurant it could
[21:50] be a travel agency this really
[21:53] common it could be an antique shop it
[21:57] could be the guy that CH copies the keys
[22:00] to your house he's a qua right and he's
[22:03] having a few dollars under the table and
[22:06] he will exchange it for you so this is
[22:08] keeping the country
[22:10] functioning if it wasn't for the qua
[22:13] system let's say the the country would
[22:16] collapse immediately right because
[22:19] people need a better currency than one
[22:23] that is self-destroying all the time we
[22:26] have in a month the inflation that
[22:29] regular countries or First World
[22:31] countries have in in a year right so
[22:35] it's really common for prices up until
[22:38] yeah a year ago perhaps prices would ra
[22:41] raise once a month but um lately they
[22:45] were Rising every two weeks every week
[22:48] change prices would change right and I I
[22:52] was too little but people that live
[22:54] lived in hyperinflation
[22:56] Argentina prices would change
[22:59] many times during the day people
[23:00] whenever they got some cash pesos they
[23:02] would run to spend it or run to buy
[23:06] dollars so we
[23:09] became uh a country that saves in dollar
[23:13] physical cash and it's a cash culture so
[23:18] whenever we buy a house or we buy a used
[23:20] car or whatever we pay with cash we did
[23:23] not have a mortgage Market because of
[23:27] all this disaster
[23:29] so when people want to buy a house in
[23:30] Argentina they have a suitcase of
[23:33] $300,000 or
[23:35] $100,000 half a million whatever we
[23:38] count it on a
[23:40] table we have a notary a guy that signs
[23:43] all the contracts or he he's a witness
[23:47] to the contracts and the other person
[23:50] leaves with the with a suitcase right um
[23:54] that's how argentines pay each other
[23:56] interesting I love that that a lot the
[23:59] the cash culture but uh I guess Bitcoin
[24:02] would be more
[24:03] efficient yeah for sure it's interesting
[24:06] for for me like I think uh all the
[24:08] things that you said shows one thing
[24:11] really clearly like not even only for
[24:14] Argentina but for globally what can
[24:17] happen with fat like a lot of people
[24:20] especially if they live like now in the
[24:22] US or in Europe or somewhere where the
[24:25] currencies not like where the currencies
[24:28] kind of stable uh even though it's
[24:30] inflating uh still a lot uh which is
[24:33] also interesting because you compare it
[24:35] to the dollar over the those years but
[24:37] even the dollar inflated a lot like even
[24:40] that is like you have to double that and
[24:43] again it lost 99% of all its purchasing
[24:47] power that's that's massive yeah it's
[24:50] it's like the dollar compared then to to
[24:53] the baso and the Argentina currencies
[24:55] over the time it's like that's that's
[24:57] massive but it shows how how weak and
[25:00] how unstable uh Fiat currencies are that
[25:04] that can happen to USA and and and
[25:07] Austria and and and uh uh Europe and all
[25:10] all the countries where the people most
[25:13] of the people don't think right now that
[25:14] it can happen like when I go out in the
[25:17] streets and when I go out out in my
[25:19] normal world they're like yeah we have
[25:22] transitory inflation a little bit but it
[25:25] it comes down again and like people are
[25:27] not aware that that problem can actually
[25:29] like really accelerate and can be a a
[25:31] major thing that hurts the economy and
[25:34] hurts the people living uh thing yeah we
[25:39] shouldn't tolerate any inflation because
[25:42] even if inflation is 2% or 3% or
[25:46] whatever it's still a system like
[25:48] Michael sailor would say that Trends
[25:51] towards nothingness I
[25:54] mean eventually you you are are
[25:58] destroying all the value even if it goes
[26:01] slowly it's yeah there's no other
[26:04] direction than than that one right H so
[26:09] the other possibility is a system that
[26:11] somehow remains at zero or a system like
[26:15] Bitcoin that it's
[26:18] deflationary in nature and I I I wrote
[26:22] recently well a book about Bitcoin and
[26:24] Argentina right and I did a calculation
[26:28] like
[26:28] how like let's say that your grandfather
[26:32] he was the richest Argentine to have
[26:35] ever lived right
[26:38] and the what the politicians in
[26:40] Argentina say is that you
[26:44] you you have to save in Argentine
[26:47] currency I mean you have
[26:50] to um I'm trying to find it but I know
[26:54] what this is you have to save in
[26:56] Argentine currency because otherwise
[26:58] you're
[26:59] unpatriotic right you're like a economic
[27:03] terrorist or whatever but the thing is
[27:06] that if your grandfather was the richest
[27:08] Argentine ever and he complied with what
[27:12] the politicians asked of
[27:14] you every successive government would
[27:18] tell him please give us
[27:21] your previous currency and we're going
[27:24] to replace it for the new one so
[27:28] you would end up with less than a US
[27:32] penny like you you start in the
[27:34] trillions of pesos which was like an
[27:37] impossibility if if this is there were
[27:40] not enough pesos back then and when you
[27:43] start taking out the zeros and taking
[27:45] out the zeros Etc you
[27:47] reach yeah like one peso and one peso
[27:51] right now is
[27:53] uh like four no it's like a
[27:58] yeah it's like less than 10% of a penny
[28:01] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[28:04] a regular basis I guess you already
[28:06] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[28:09] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[28:12] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[28:14] personal recommendation for harder
[28:16] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure

[29:19] completely new for you guys I partnered
[29:22] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[29:26] beautiful Bitcoin time that I ever saw
[29:29] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[29:32] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[29:35] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[29:38] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[29:41] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[29:43] watch brand is Bitcoin only make sure to
[29:47] check out the link in the description
[29:49] for this amazing coin vigilante time
[29:52] pieces those watches are amazing I love
[29:54] them so much it was really hard for me
[29:56] to pick the one that I want to to have
[29:58] because there are a lot of great options
[30:00] I went with the new transparency Edition
[30:03] they're all limited so grab yours those
[30:07] will not be available for a long time
[30:09] but there will come new models and new
[30:11] amazing designs along the way it show
[30:14] shows how how bad inflation like and you
[30:16] said it right like even a little bit
[30:18] inflation like even 0.1% inflation uh
[30:21] would be too much even though it would
[30:24] be probably um not that uh um feelable
[30:29] for most people but like 1% 2% and then
[30:32] we come to the uh levels where we are
[30:36] right now with 10 15 20% where when you
[30:39] have a really good currency uh and then
[30:41] there's like 50 or 100% or like even
[30:45] even over 100% that's that's really bad
[30:48] but what I'm um also curious what did
[30:52] change actually since chavier Mal now is
[30:56] in there because I think one of his big
[30:59] things that he always talked about is he
[31:01] wants to have a free competition around
[31:04] currencies uh that he likes Bitcoin but
[31:06] he wants a free competition uh and that
[31:09] he wants to demolish the the central
[31:11] banks and a lot of other institutions in
[31:13] Argentina that's kind of what what I
[31:15] heard from him or someone that is living
[31:18] in Europe and is uh far away from
[31:21] Argentina right so well the story with
[31:25] Javier is he was a regular Economist
[31:29] like at least not so much kesian but he
[31:32] was let's say Chicago School of
[31:34] Economics right
[31:36] monetarist perhaps he yeah he knew
[31:38] Milton Freedman but he had never heard
[31:41] about the austrians or yeah
[31:44] Libertarians and somebody in 2014 he
[31:48] they gave him a rothbart and misses he
[31:53] really liked the the books and he he
[31:58] somewhat compulsive Behavior he went to
[32:00] a library and bought all the books he
[32:02] could find on Austrian
[32:04] economics he recently told this story
[32:07] they gave him an award in Germany in
[32:10] Hayek Foundation or Society I'm not sure
[32:13] the name and you could look this up it's
[32:16] on YouTube there's a talk jaier gave
[32:19] when they gave him the award right haek
[32:23] Institute so he tells the whole story
[32:26] how he got a
[32:28] like he lock himself up in the apartment
[32:31] for two weeks reading all the books
[32:34] right like a complete book nerd and well
[32:38] he came out an Austrian and back then I
[32:42] have
[32:43] this
[32:45] well I won't say connection but he
[32:48] started adding on Facebook he was like
[32:52] any regular guy like us right so he
[32:56] started adding Libertarians on Facebook
[32:59] and he added me on Facebook right back
[33:02] in 2014 so he sent me a message thank
[33:04] you for accepting my friend request
[33:07] cheers JM right and at first well I
[33:10] didn't know much about him but he
[33:12] started going to radio stations doing
[33:15] radio
[33:16] programs since 2014 I have been trying
[33:19] to Orange build him like I sent him a a
[33:23] link to a a talk I gave and I have on
[33:26] YouTube
[33:28] and but um back then I also thought he
[33:33] was
[33:34] crazy like he started talking
[33:37] about yeah large purchases of Bitcoin
[33:41] and when I first saw him on
[33:43] person he he was like with a shirt and
[33:47] swimming swimming pads swimming shorts
[33:50] underneath like this mismatch right
[33:54] between what's up and down so yeah I
[33:56] didn't like follow up
[33:59] and and kept
[34:01] trying but yeah he continued doing the
[34:04] proof of work let's say he continued
[34:06] nonstop going to TV channels he
[34:09] eventually got into National
[34:11] TV and and I guess that the reason why
[34:16] he became so popular is because he put a
[34:19] lot of passion right the Argentine love
[34:22] passion we love football we love I know
[34:26] rock music or whatever right right so I
[34:29] believe it was break from what we call
[34:32] Cocktail realism the people that only
[34:36] meeting yeah like High
[34:39] Society cocktails and and finger
[34:43] food
[34:45] so nobody expected him to be so
[34:49] popular ER but in the pandemic he
[34:52] decided he wanted to run for
[34:54] deputy and he got a lot of boats I I
[34:57] don't remember if it was
[34:59] 133% yeah like around
[35:02] 13.5% of all the votes they were
[35:05] expecting him to get like 3% 5% right so
[35:10] it was a huge news he didn't have a
[35:12] political party so he had to yeah make a
[35:16] coalition of other
[35:18] parties for him to be able to run and
[35:21] the same thing happened two years later
[35:23] when he run for president in the
[35:25] primaries in Argentina we have a primary
[35:28] election system that is like mandatory
[35:30] we have to vote on the
[35:32] primaries and in the primaries he got in
[35:35] first place he got like 30% of all the
[35:39] votes in the primary so that was also a
[35:41] shock to to a lot of people they weren't
[35:45] expecting that when we had the actual
[35:47] election he came in second but since
[35:52] the the distance between the first and
[35:54] the second is so tight there's a rerun
[35:57] of the election
[35:58] by law right by Lage they call it so in
[36:02] the Run he won right he got 56%
[36:08] something like this so it's also quite
[36:10] an interesting phenomenon that I was
[36:12] there when he did his inaugural speech
[36:15] in yeah the main Square in front of
[36:19] Congress and he was telling people okay
[36:23] we don't have any more money we're going
[36:26] to have a really hard time for the next
[36:28] few months we're going to suffer more
[36:31] and people were
[36:33] yay like we're going to suffer
[36:36] more so it's a not many politicians can
[36:40] do that right not many
[36:42] politicians can tell give a this kind of
[36:46] message instead of telling
[36:49] people yeah I'm GNA fix everything but I
[36:53] guess argentine's got used to for the
[36:56] last 20 years
[36:59] each year that comes is worse than the
[37:01] previous so it's really tough on people
[37:04] right imagine if your life instead of
[37:07] becoming better through the years no
[37:11] it's uh it's always getting harder
[37:14] because this year you have 10% inflation
[37:16] but next year you have 15 and next year
[37:18] you have 20 and next year you have 30
[37:20] and 40 and 50 and 60 and 70 right and
[37:25] your if you have a salary is not not
[37:27] going up as fast as the
[37:29] inflation so to give you an
[37:33] example in 2019 at the beginning of 2019
[37:38] an Argentine salary was like let's say
[37:41] $1,000 a month so that could be on par
[37:45] with some European poor poor European
[37:47] country right I know Portugal Spain I
[37:50] know some people make a
[37:52] th000
[37:54] okay on the day that we had primary
[37:58] elections in
[38:00] 2019 the F the person that came on top
[38:03] was Alberto Fernandez which was from the
[38:05] left so during the night of the Sunday
[38:08] and the morning of the
[38:10] Monday we could see thanks to
[38:13] the crypto market like the USD exchange
[38:16] to
[38:18] pesos that the USD exchange rate
[38:22] was instead of 40 pesos to a dollar it
[38:26] was going towards
[38:28] 60 so it's really funny that in TV media
[38:32] in Argentina they needed to start
[38:35] talking about the crypto exchange rate
[38:39] the crypto dollar right they call
[38:42] it because it was an a measure of what
[38:46] was going on in the Market at night when
[38:49] all the markets are
[38:51] closed and the next day the market went
[38:53] to 60 so the exchange rate fell from 40
[38:57] p pesos to 60 pesos to a dollar so by
[39:00] next Monday salaries instead of being
[39:03] $1,000 a month they were around
[39:08] 650 amount so just like that you lose
[39:11] like 33% of all your salary in one day
[39:15] right all because everybody decided to
[39:19] vote ER yeah left his government and
[39:22] that me Alberto in the main election he
[39:25] won
[39:28] so he got the administration the the
[39:31] government with a dollar rate at
[39:34] 60 four years later he gave the
[39:38] government to mle with a black market
[39:42] rate of
[39:44] 1,200 so going from 60 to 1,200 in four
[39:48] years it's like a
[39:51] 95% argentine's only kept
[39:55] 5% of their value in in four years so
[40:00] this is
[40:02] why yeah in the pandemic people started
[40:05] going well into Bitcoin USD
[40:08] defi sadly yeah defi started becoming
[40:12] more popular and people wanted to get
[40:15] rich quick and they saw this Luna scam
[40:19] yielding 20% per year and a lot of
[40:23] people got wrecked by Luna and USD and
[40:27] the quas yeah this let's say parallel
[40:31] banking system we
[40:33] have they started also using USD right
[40:37] quas that have for 30 40 50 years been
[40:40] using only PES on dollar now they
[40:44] started offering their clients or even
[40:47] between themselves if they want to pay
[40:49] the between themselves they could
[40:51] pay by by sending a USD transfer
[40:55] so so yeah now
[40:57] we're in a situation with Javier that um
[41:02] he still doesn't have many deputies and
[41:05] Senators he got a the idea of pushing a
[41:09] new law that he called the Omnibus law
[41:13] it meant like it's a law that's so big
[41:16] as a bus right so it has 600 articles
[41:20] modifying hundreds of laws all at
[41:24] once it took him like six to seven
[41:27] months to to pass this law they they
[41:30] wouldn't let him right or at first they
[41:33] would approve the law in
[41:35] general but then when they started going
[41:38] article by article they started taking
[41:39] out all the good
[41:41] articles and so he said at first screw
[41:44] it I'm not pushing this
[41:47] law I'm withdrawing the law and then he
[41:50] proposed another one so but well
[41:52] eventually he got a sort of version of
[41:55] this passed
[41:58] and so it's still quite hard for him to
[42:02] to make a lot of modifications but every
[42:05] I'm watching yeah Twitter X and you
[42:08] could see every day they're taking out
[42:10] some regulation some Argentina was full
[42:14] of ridiculous all kinds of laws all
[42:16] kinds of regulations all all kinds of
[42:19] taxes
[42:21] restrictions like I say it was going
[42:24] towards a Venezuela or it was going
[42:26] towards Soviet Union country right but
[42:30] the sad aspect is that still
[42:33] Argentina has doesn't have monetary
[42:36] freedom I thought that he would take the
[42:39] restrictions like from day one right oh
[42:43] I'm I'm letting you buy and sell dollars
[42:45] freely but in in in legal terms it's not
[42:49] there
[42:50] yet the restrictions are still there yet
[42:53] he has some some excuses he says he
[42:56] keepes right so he says oh no I'm I'm
[42:59] doing this because I need
[43:02] to clean up the balance sheet the
[43:05] balance sheet of the Central
[43:06] Bank the previous administration would
[43:09] say oh I I gave you a central bank with
[43:11] I know 10 billion and M says no you gave
[43:15] me a central bank with minus 10 billion
[43:18] it's it's totally broke in the negative
[43:21] right it's like if we didn't have it so
[43:25] he says he's yeah taking this time to
[43:29] gather billions of dollars in the
[43:31] coffers and then he says he he will open
[43:35] up all the
[43:37] restrictions and then he says he will
[43:39] give us monetary
[43:40] freedom and then when we can put Bitcoin
[43:44] inside of that he has given some
[43:47] examples because people ask
[43:49] him even we have a foreign
[43:53] minister yeah foreign affairs minister
[43:57] she's a woman Dianna mondino and Dianna
[44:01] is a bitcoiner like from 10 years ago
[44:04] she understands
[44:06] Bitcoin and she sometimes whenever she
[44:08] can yeah she she says you you're going
[44:11] to be able to use Bitcoin and so
[44:13] on but so so yeah we we my my my
[44:17] conclusion would be we still have to
[44:19] wait a bit there are many forces acting
[44:21] against him all the
[44:23] media all the universities and
[44:27] College
[44:29] professors some yes union leaders you
[44:32] could say
[44:34] some protectionist businessmen right
[44:37] that have always throughout their lives
[44:41] dealt through favors with the state well
[44:44] they want him out right and they trying
[44:47] everything in their power for him to
[44:49] fail and for him to leave office
[44:52] argentine's like this idea of failing
[44:55] presidents that we need to to have them
[44:57] removed so yeah it's a really tough
[45:00] situation to be in he has to push and
[45:02] sustain
[45:03] himself also next
[45:06] year October I guess we have midterm
[45:08] elections so we we should see if he gets
[45:11] more deputies and more Senators you can
[45:14] measure the support he still has because
[45:18] still argentines are suffering a lot
[45:22] like that salary I told you that was
[45:24] $1,000 five years ago
[45:27] now argentines are making like $300 a
[45:30] month so imagine going from a th000 to
[45:33] $10 a day right ER how would you survive
[45:38] with 10 a day how how much can you save
[45:41] like to buy a house like if you're are a
[45:44] genius you can save I know 50 a month
[45:47] right so how how how can you come up
[45:50] with 50,000 $100,000 EUR so so yeah the
[45:55] situation is really bad if Argentina
[45:58] doesn't start growing
[46:00] soon yeah we cannot know how much people
[46:03] can
[46:04] tolerate the situation and they they
[46:07] want the situation to explode on him and
[46:11] then the left will say see this was
[46:14] liberalism this was libertarianism at
[46:17] work everything explodes when you try
[46:20] this and we have to go back to socialism
[46:23] right to populism so yeah we are working
[46:26] a really
[46:27] fine line in Argentina so it could
[46:30] go like if he's successful successful
[46:33] Argentina is going to be yeah a great
[46:37] country to be in with a lot of freedom
[46:39] welcoming Libertarians but he he fails
[46:42] we we will continue down the downwards
[46:45] path that we been on like if the other
[46:47] candidate had won Serio Masa now the
[46:51] salaries would be at $100 a month and
[46:54] then eventually you go to 50 and then
[46:55] you're Venezuela
[46:57] in Venezuela and Kuba people are making
[47:00] 50 $30 a month right so $1 a day so so
[47:04] yeah this is the sad story of how Fiat
[47:08] can destroy a nation right a country a
[47:11] society it all breaks
[47:13] down do you think that there is a chance
[47:17] that when chavier Mal is a successful
[47:21] that Argentina might even be one of the
[47:24] first major countries because like
[47:27] El Salvador is is a lot smaller than
[47:30] Argentina that Argentina will be the
[47:33] first major country to to adopt a
[47:36] Bitcoin standard or maybe just
[47:38] like have Bitcoin as a very legal form
[47:42] and as a very um widespread form of uh
[47:47] currency well the thing is I I don't
[47:50] think behavier will do like what buele
[47:54] did of doing a legal tender it's most
[47:57] likely that he removes like legal tender
[47:59] laws like like there's no official
[48:01] currency of the land something like this
[48:05] because yeah I I have been trying I met
[48:09] jaier many times through through the
[48:11] years we he he was going to Austrian
[48:14] economic
[48:15] conferences uh libertarian meetups right
[48:18] whenever I approach him and try to talk
[48:20] to him about
[48:21] Bitcoin you could you could speak to him
[48:24] like for two minutes and then he would
[48:25] say yes
[48:27] H Bitcoin is a private money I am all in
[48:30] for private
[48:31] monies right and and he goes away he he
[48:35] doesn't want to know more like he
[48:39] doesn't care to more know more so he
[48:41] does not know the difference between
[48:43] Bitcoin and
[48:44] ethereum like why proof of work is
[48:46] better than proof of stake what a hash
[48:48] function is or the the difficulty
[48:50] adjustment mechanism right I don't guess
[48:54] he he he has all of this in mind I'm not
[48:57] sure he will
[48:58] Advocate Bitcoin over any other crypto
[49:03] so he he he will give us the freedoms I
[49:06] believe that that is it right we we
[49:09] Haven an orange build him enough like to
[49:12] be
[49:14] a but but I I guess with if if there's
[49:18] like true Freedom around currencies and
[49:20] around which asset to choose to to to
[49:23] buy your assets from then in a free
[49:26] market
[49:27] long-term Bitcoin succeeds in there like
[49:31] if if I can freely choose in Austra
[49:34] between having Bitcoin as a currency or
[49:38] having Euro as a currency uh with like
[49:41] there's regulatory no um difference
[49:44] between that I would choose Bitcoin all
[49:46] the time like I I would love to pay
[49:48] everything in Bitcoin if there's no
[49:50] capital gains tax if there's not not
[49:52] other things around that like I would
[49:55] choose Bitcoin like to today that's what
[49:58] I kind of also mean with like okay he is
[50:00] successful with getting the framework
[50:03] really friendly around uh free
[50:06] currencies um that would be I I think
[50:10] that could be good of course we still
[50:11] need education we still need the
[50:13] merchants to accept it we still need a
[50:14] lot of work to be done but it could it
[50:18] could be the the start of something
[50:20] really cool I I hope so at least yeah
[50:23] yeah and I now it's interesting to see
[50:26] that some people from Europe and people
[50:29] from the United States are considering
[50:31] going to leave to
[50:33] Argentina so I have never seen that in
[50:36] my life right but ever since this
[50:39] January friend told me hey a Bitcoin or
[50:41] friend is coming can you please show him
[50:43] around and yeah sure and then so we
[50:48] started going to barbecues EA didn't
[50:49] meat right ER and then another friend
[50:53] came right and then there was this Swiss
[50:56] guy and then another friend and pretty
[50:58] soon we were like a group of 10 people
[51:00] right going around and they were
[51:03] postponing the return ticket every week
[51:06] they would postpone it one week
[51:10] and some started considering hey hey I
[51:13] could live here like six months per year
[51:16] and in two years I get an Argentine
[51:18] passport right ER it's a really low
[51:22] requirement like a lot of Russians now
[51:25] are going to Argentina to have babies
[51:27] and and get an Argentine passport right
[51:31] we're getting full of
[51:32] Russians even some Americans are going
[51:36] to Argentina so that that's blowing my
[51:38] mind like Americans trying to have an
[51:41] Argentine
[51:43] passport it's crazy crazy like I also
[51:46] like I have a friend of mine who is
[51:49] coming from Austria to Argentina and he
[51:52] when I told him like oh yeah like I'm
[51:54] like Argentina is one of my count is
[51:57] that is on my lists where like if if
[51:59] Austria goes south that I consider going
[52:02] to uh and he's like why why do you want
[52:05] to go to
[52:06] Argentina he was completely like like I
[52:10] just I came here to Austria to find
[52:13] better possibilities and now you have
[52:16] you are in Austria you have better
[52:17] possibilities and you want to go to
[52:18] Argentina and I'm like I see something
[52:21] in Javier m i see something in the
[52:23] policies and there might be something
[52:26] positive POS like obviously now um maybe
[52:29] not right now because now there's lot of
[52:33] uncertainties still there but what if
[52:36] that continues the way where chv M and
[52:40] and that political view of chvy M is
[52:44] successful uh and then other countries
[52:46] like the EU and the Americans uh driving
[52:50] this CA Harris Biden
[52:54] economics style then lot of people can
[52:57] come to Argentina if Cala wins yeah it's
[53:01] a I would say a no-brainer like right
[53:04] people should go to
[53:06] Argentina if Trump
[53:08] wins I know Trump I was in Nashville at
[53:12] the
[53:13] conference and he seemed the a little
[53:17] upgraded from the first Trump so now
[53:21] he's surrounding himself with
[53:23] Libertarians right so this
[53:27] this hasn't happened before
[53:29] right he's paying more attention to like
[53:32] a Peter teal an Elon mask the Winkle
[53:35] Bros
[53:37] Brothers bbec ramaswami right so he gave
[53:40] this speech of course he he he got fed a
[53:44] speech right somebody wrote the speech
[53:46] for
[53:47] him
[53:49] but yeah it's changing especially
[53:52] Kennedy gave a tremendous speech and
[53:55] Kennedy said set up the bar really high
[53:58] right it's like Kennedy he said after
[54:02] two years of being in this crypto World
[54:04] he's now starting to get it right he's
[54:06] now starting to get why Bitcoin and not
[54:08] crypto and and he gave a lot of things
[54:11] like well REM removing capital gains tax
[54:15] and making a transactions between dollar
[54:18] and Bitcoin irrep like that by law you
[54:24] you don't have to report it right so
[54:27] those two
[54:28] things really open up everything right
[54:32] it will be sort of what I'm not sure if
[54:35] even better than than melee but so it's
[54:39] crazy to
[54:41] see America going that way right even
[54:45] both of
[54:47] them no I'm not sure if it was Trump but
[54:49] also trying to build this stash for for
[54:52] the US government of Bitcoin like a
[54:55] strategic Reg reserves yeah for example
[54:57] Kier hasn't said that right jaier has
[55:00] never so far mentioned that so yeah if
[55:04] Europe continues down this downward path
[55:08] and camela Harris wins yeah
[55:11] Argentina and very few other places are
[55:14] like a Beacon of Hope right to to go
[55:18] there but I I should also warn people
[55:21] that the Argentine
[55:24] economy is been destroyed
[55:27] in comparison so you might experience an
[55:31] upswing and that means
[55:34] growth but so you can experience some
[55:37] economic
[55:38] growth but the size of the businesses is
[55:42] is is much smaller like U you won't find
[55:46] as as many rich clients to do business
[55:50] with the average person doesn't have
[55:52] much money right so so so yeah there's
[55:56] like a yeah like a tradeoff there like
[55:59] you may be able to
[56:02] ride the upswing perhaps on the stock
[56:05] market or buying real
[56:08] estate or whatever but don't expect to
[56:12] perhaps make the deals that you were
[56:13] making in Europe or or the United States
[56:17] like you won't have such a
[56:20] develop you won't have like a silicon
[56:22] ballet in Argentina so yet if want you
[56:26] can build it but but there's no Capital
[56:29] Market for Venture capitals that is
[56:32] significant right so yeah it it might be
[56:35] uh interesting for for remote businesses
[56:38] like even my podcast because like I
[56:40] don't like I live in actually a quite
[56:43] expensive country and my income is not
[56:46] depending on Austria but Austria is has
[56:49] like one of the highest um uh expenses I
[56:52] think there like Sweden that is more
[56:54] expensive there's Swiss that is more
[56:55] expensive expensive there are some other
[56:57] countries that are more expensive than
[56:58] Austria but uh it is on the higher end
[57:01] of of your living expenses so like uh I
[57:06] myself for example would benefit from um
[57:10] lower cost of living country where it's
[57:12] still safe where it's still like like
[57:15] where it's still good to to be there uh
[57:17] so that could be an interesting thing
[57:20] yeah if your income is independent of
[57:23] location like digital Nomads it's a good
[57:26] idea some parts of
[57:28] Argentina aren't as safe let's say
[57:33] right you would have to go yeah to
[57:36] little cities or little towns to be as
[57:38] safe as Europe
[57:41] right but well I've been traveling
[57:45] around Europe with Bitcoin which is a
[57:47] vanand right we have the T-shirt here
[57:49] Bitcoin the little B but you realize
[57:53] it's so much safer right uh it took me a
[57:56] few months in Argentina you're always
[57:59] expecting at least in the oneide the
[58:01] city like somebody to seal your phone
[58:04] right so you have to always be wary of
[58:08] where's my phone like because in the
[58:11] city in the in the main city they
[58:13] perhaps they they snatch it right but if
[58:16] you start going towards outside of the
[58:18] city the capital it becomes more violent
[58:22] so it becomes like I bring a gun right
[58:25] give me the phone right right or people
[58:28] they get approached by people on
[58:31] motorbikes right two people whenever
[58:33] you're entering your house or leaving
[58:36] your house and they want your car right
[58:39] or they want to
[58:40] steal what's in your house and so on so
[58:44] yeah it's not as safe as Europe right if
[58:47] you find some
[58:49] locations in the country where you're
[58:53] either in a good neighborhood or you're
[58:55] in a little town yeah nothing perhaps
[58:58] goes on there right but but yeah it's
[59:01] not the
[59:02] same in that regard it's not as bad as
[59:06] what Salvador used to be or some other
[59:09] countries in Central
[59:11] America but you have to keep it in mind
[59:14] right like I have to protect my
[59:17] belongings my laptop my DSLR
[59:22] camera and so on because these things
[59:27] remember Argentina has so much high high
[59:29] taxes still that an iPhone like this new
[59:33] one would be like 1,500
[59:37] 1,500 right and the salary is 300 per
[59:42] month so this is five months of salary
[59:45] right for a
[59:46] person and that's why there's this
[59:50] incentive to to steal a phone all
[59:54] right here um but well there are
[59:57] benefits like the meat is super good and
[60:01] cheap like at sometimes when it went the
[60:04] lowest you you might be able to buy a
[60:07] kilo of Sir of loin or revive for like
[60:11] $5 a kilo right you you a whole kilo of
[60:17] really good meat and some other Cuts
[60:20] would be even like $3 a
[60:22] kilo now Argentina is becoming more
[60:25] expensive
[60:26] because as Javier is trying to make
[60:31] Argentina normal country
[60:32] again the prices will they're rising in
[60:37] in dollar terms right it's not as cheap
[60:41] I remember last year I went in November
[60:44] and I was able to fill the gas tank of
[60:46] the car for
[60:49] $12 a few months later you would take
[60:53] three times as much dollars 36
[60:56] to fill the car now 36 is still cheaper
[61:00] than
[61:01] Europe but for an Argentine that is
[61:03] making
[61:05] pesos having to pay three times as much
[61:07] in
[61:08] dollars it's
[61:10] tough right so so yeah those kind of
[61:14] situations are always going on people
[61:16] are always trying to have having to
[61:20] figure out how to
[61:21] survive right and speculating know
[61:24] should I buy the dollar should I sell
[61:27] dollar should I wait and not pay my my
[61:30] bills until next month and they always
[61:33] like this right having to develop a like
[61:37] a master's degree in
[61:40] finance in order to survive yeah yeah
[61:44] that's that's what bitco brings like you
[61:46] don't have to have a MRE H thank you so
[61:48] much already like it was a extremely
[61:50] nice Insight in in Argentina uh and
[61:54] what's going on there um unfortunately
[61:56] like we already over our time I think we
[61:59] could make it very long we could even
[62:01] make a series about that um but we
[62:04] definitely have a second round I would
[62:06] say but we have another end routine
[62:08] where you have two questions uh that is
[62:11] always the same the first question is
[62:14] what can we learn from you besides all
[62:16] the things uh that we already talked
[62:18] about well uh about me personally about
[62:21] Bitcoin um well we we are doing a tour
[62:26] of Europe with a Bitcoin which is a
[62:29] vanan right you can follow it if you
[62:31] want on Twitter La Bitcoin it's at
[62:35] Bitcoin
[62:36] EU so the idea is to do meetups small
[62:41] conferences teach people about Bitcoin
[62:44] right do Evangel evangelism spreading
[62:47] the good word and recently because of I
[62:51] got this idea in
[62:53] Munich I realize people people in Europe
[62:56] didn't know much about Argentina so I
[63:00] got this idea to write a book so I did
[63:02] this Bitcoin
[63:03] prophecy and I got the Argentine flag in
[63:06] there and it's also about Bitcoin so so
[63:10] yeah this book is still not available on
[63:12] Amazon but I'm traveling throughout the
[63:15] conferences and like if you're going to
[63:18] I
[63:19] know Lugano Plan B Forum or there
[63:23] there's going to be a few conferences
[63:25] well I have it there and you can get it
[63:27] so yeah and you can follow me on Twitter
[63:29] as well I'm Ariel
[63:32] agil in Twitter amazing thank you so
[63:35] much um perfect then next question uh
[63:37] this is the endro team question where
[63:39] the previous guest is asking a question
[63:40] for the next guest without knowing who
[63:41] the next guest is uh and the question is
[63:44] a really interesting one because he's
[63:46] asking explain whatever your expertise
[63:49] in Bitcoin is to a 5-year-old so
[63:52] basically explain the situation in
[63:55] Argentina
[63:56] uh to a 5year old one stuff well you
[63:59] have to tell him what money is I guess
[64:03] so you you can tell him that money is
[64:07] what you use
[64:09] to get the things you want when you go
[64:12] to the candy store or when you go to the
[64:15] toy shop right people
[64:18] want the money in order to give you
[64:20] something in
[64:22] return and that person that takes the
[64:25] money will use it to pay for his food
[64:28] and his house and whatever he wants
[64:31] right so we are all
[64:34] moving this thing around or this money
[64:38] around and and paying and choosing what
[64:41] we want right so now that I somewhat
[64:45] explain the the key what a money is I
[64:48] would say now there are like bad monies
[64:52] and good monies right the bad money is a
[64:56] bunny that like a yeah it would it would
[65:01] I'm not sure if I the word destroyed he
[65:03] will get it
[65:05] but for example today you can buy two
[65:11] toys but in one month you can only buy
[65:14] one toy right so that is no good you
[65:18] want a a money that at least can always
[65:22] buy you three Toys the same amount of
[65:25] money
[65:26] right and if the to if the
[65:28] money through as time goes on and you
[65:31] are six years old in one year you will
[65:34] be six if the money can purchase you
[65:36] four toys instead of three it's better
[65:39] for you right so why would you choose
[65:41] the
[65:42] money that each month gives you less
[65:45] toys you can you you you're allowed to
[65:48] choose the the money that gives you the
[65:51] more the more chice so you can also
[65:55] learn
[65:56] and decide for yourself do you want
[65:58] three toys now or do you want four toys
[66:00] in a
[66:02] year
[66:03] right what's can you can you wait for a
[66:06] year and get four instead of three well
[66:10] you have to choose most likely he will
[66:12] say no I want three toys now and you can
[66:15] start playing right well would you want
[66:18] 10 toys in a year 50 toys in year so on
[66:21] right so yeah this is how I would try to
[66:24] explain him and I would say yeah the the
[66:26] money that gives you the more toys in
[66:29] the future is
[66:31] Bitcoin amazing I I love that a lot uh
[66:35] perfect then yeah thank you so much for
[66:37] for being on Ariel uh was a pleasure
[66:40] talking with you also thank you so much
[66:41] for everyone that is watching and
[66:42] listening uh as always I'll be back
