[00:00] [Music]
[00:07] the top five stories of this week let's
[00:11] go number one is from the Bitcoin
[00:13] archive new Ferrari to accept Bitcoin
[00:16] and crypto
[00:18] payments for its cars in the US V Lambo
[00:23] it's a good question it's also a good
[00:24] question when is Tesla continuing the
[00:27] Bitcoin payments they still have Bitcoin
[00:29] and I remember IL musk saying something
[00:32] about 50% renewable energy use it's
[00:34] clear that Bitcoin is more than 50%
[00:37] renewable important to note here on this
[00:40] story is also that Ferrari is not really
[00:44] accepting Bitcoin of course they
[00:46] accepting Bitcoin but they are also
[00:47] converting it back to Fiat it's a first
[00:50] step in the process they are accepting
[00:52] Bitcoin definitely a step in the right
[00:54] direction let's move on to number two
[00:57] documenting Bitcoin wrad breaking new
[00:59] Rec Rec Bitcoin hash rate I can tell you
[01:02] since 2021 since the mass Exodus from
[01:06] China from the Bitcoin mining game the
[01:08] Bitcoin hash rate just went up and up
[01:10] and up it was a really interesting year
[01:12] 2021 when China accident the Bitcoin
[01:14] mining game it went down 50% after few
[01:17] weeks it was back at the original high
[01:20] and since then and just keeps moving up
[01:22] despite the price being down more than
[01:24] 50% from the all-time high the Bitcoin
[01:27] mining hash rate continues to out form
[01:30] every expectation even mine it's a
[01:32] business model that just keeps on
[01:34] growing mining Bitcoin will be a big big
[01:37] business not just now but especially in
[01:39] the future number three is from the
[01:42] Bitcoin therapist I love his Twitter
[01:44] Channel by the way Bitcoin ETF is
[01:47] incoming get ready for the bull market
[01:50] SSC will not appeal Bitcoin ETF Court
[01:53] decision this was a big news story it
[01:55] didn't had any impact on the price but
[01:58] it could have a really really really big
[02:00] impact in the story of Bitcoin or in the
[02:04] end of 2023 because now the SS didn't
[02:07] appeal to a US court decision there can
[02:10] still some small things happen along the
[02:12] way but if it goes through and then the
[02:15] grayscale rust can work with the S
[02:18] towards an spot Bitcoin ETF there's no
[02:21] reason why all the other Bitcoin ETFs
[02:23] should also not be able to become actual
[02:26] Bitcoin ETFs so we could look at the
[02:28] situation where we have in the next 3 to
[02:31] six to maybe 8 nine months five six
[02:34] seven spot Bitcoin edfs If It Moves In a
[02:37] good and fast fashion but as I said in
[02:39] the previous video It Doesn't Matter
[02:41] Bitcoin doesn't care about the SEC or
[02:43] grayscale or any other Bitcoin spot ETF
[02:46] providers Bitcoin just keeps on
[02:48] producing block after block Tik Tok next
[02:50] block number four is from the bitcoin
[02:53] news Justin Carolyn ellenson testifies
[02:56] today that Sam bankman fraud star
[02:59] instructed her to keep selling Bitcoin
[03:01] if it's over 20k us the Bitcoin they
[03:05] sold were from stolen customer funds
[03:09] first of all this news story teaches us
[03:11] that we should always keep our Bitcoin
[03:14] off exchanges always keep your Bitcoin
[03:17] in Cold Storage in your own Keys hold
[03:20] your own keys or someone else will and
[03:23] the second part of the story I really
[03:25] don't care I couldn't care less about
[03:27] Sam bankman froster I couldn't care
[03:30] about that Caroline girl they made a
[03:32] mess in the cryptosphere but if you're
[03:34] really a bitcoiner you never used FDX
[03:37] why would you care what they did maybe
[03:39] they impacted the price but who cares we
[03:42] get a little cheaper sets just keep on
[03:44] stacking sets just keep on educating
[03:47] people it's so easy last but not least
[03:50] we have the Bitcoin conference thank you
[03:54] Amsterdam and another Unforgettable
[03:56] event in the book see you all at Bitcoin
[03:58] 2024 and Nashville I wasn't there first
[04:01] of all I would love to be there Bitcoin
[04:05] conferences are always nice to be it's
[04:07] AAL place where a lot of likeminded
[04:10] people are but they cost a lot of Subs
[04:13] if you are actually a true Bitcoin and
[04:16] you see how many Subs you have to invest
[04:18] to get to those conferences it's a lot
[04:20] I'm still in a lot of Bitcoin
[04:22] conferences the last big one I was at
[04:25] Brock for everybody who never intended
[04:28] such a big Bitcoin conference if you can
[04:31] afford it in any way shape or form you
[04:33] should try it once you find a lot of
[04:36] cool people there and you also get a
[04:38] nice overview of what's going on in the
[04:40] industry what's going on with the
[04:42] Bitcoin mining companies with other
[04:44] companies with lightning companies with
[04:47] exchanges who is there who can I talk to
[04:50] it's it's always cool to talk with
[04:52] directly to a person from the companies
[04:54] so with that being said I hope I see you
[04:56] all in the next one
