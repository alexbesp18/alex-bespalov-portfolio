[00:00] which country in the world is teaching
[00:02] Bitcoin as part of their financial
[00:04] literacy most School boards around the
[00:06] world don't even teach financial
[00:08] literacy it's reversing the brain train
[00:11] of a salad by the time Canada adopts
[00:13] Bitcoin in some way or Europe begins to
[00:16] make headways into Bitcoin El Salvador
[00:19] will be fully onboarded smaller
[00:21] countries that look now towards America
[00:25] and they're like okay America might do
[00:28] something and we are smaller countri so
[00:31] like we should front run them what good
[00:33] is it to have Bitcoin in our country as
[00:35] legal tender if it's the murder capital
[00:38] of the world we want to be the financial
[00:40] capital of the world the future
[00:41] Financial capital of the world based on
[00:43] a Bitcoin standard El Salvador was one
[00:45] of the top five destinations in terms of
[00:48] growth post pandemic what the G7 Nation
[00:51] will be the first one to print money to
[00:53] buy
[00:54] [Music]
[00:58] Bitcoin how's the internet in Salvador
[01:01] is it good uh yeah it's uh it's pretty
[01:05] good actually um we um oh uh Robin I
[01:10] should say that I'm not in El Salvador
[01:12] right now this is the public library and
[01:15] where I live in Canada at the at the
[01:17] moment oh you're not there okay no no
[01:20] I'm not I'm not there but um internet
[01:23] connection El is perfect is uh there's
[01:27] there's some like like if you go to like
[01:29] uh the mountains in chatango there won't
[01:32] be a lot of coverage but there isn't a
[01:33] lot of people there so it it really
[01:36] doesn't uh you know affect many people
[01:39] and and so many people are have been
[01:41] getting uh starlink nowadays too so like
[01:44] my cousin uh lives uh he has a beach
[01:47] house or a a lake house and they didn't
[01:50] have any and he lives on an island there
[01:52] uh when he goes there and um he got
[01:55] Starling CU there's just no practical
[01:58] way to get uh an internet connection
[02:00] there and then as soon as he got it like
[02:03] basically every every neighbor got it
[02:06] so it's uh cool but but you in you live
[02:09] in El Salvador or you live in Canada or
[02:11] in both places kind of uh kind of like
[02:14] both places so yeah so my main uh my
[02:18] main job if you will my Fiat job is here
[02:22] in Canada and my kids are going to
[02:25] school here in Canada so uh I'm here but
[02:28] the idea is to get down there as soon as
[02:31] um you know they're they're done going
[02:33] to school and and like my goal is to
[02:35] just retire I mean I'm I'm far away from
[02:39] retirement but like at least um you know
[02:42] have two stable homes one here in Canada
[02:46] and one in um in in El Salvador
[02:49] especially after the things that we've
[02:50] seen improving in the country like
[02:53] that's the goal for many people like me
[02:55] who who are kind of in my situation
[02:57] there's many of us actually the Salvador
[02:59] and dasas
[03:00] who um may have a job in the states or
[03:04] Canada or Australia or Europe but then
[03:07] we have family and sometimes property
[03:11] and you know interests in in in El
[03:14] Salvador so and our hard still there so
[03:18] you w to move for retirement to uh El
[03:23] Salvador or even before like you know
[03:27] spend Winters down there working
[03:29] remotely thing you know that that would
[03:32] be an ideal kind of situation for me so
[03:36] so the sooner the better the the sooner
[03:39] the more in elavo the
[03:42] better yeah yeah that's right uh you
[03:47] know like I married a Canadian girl and
[03:49] so my wife's Canadian and you know one
[03:52] of the things that I often talk about is
[03:55] like you know like what um when people
[03:59] leave their
[04:00] home sometimes it's not by choice
[04:03] sometimes it is but but you know
[04:05] immigration sometimes is forced right
[04:09] and um and it's you know you might be
[04:12] living in the middle of the desert but
[04:15] that's your home that's where your
[04:17] network of support is that's where your
[04:19] family is and for some people it'll be
[04:21] like well why would you want to live in
[04:23] the desert why you know or or a place
[04:25] that's not palatable to
[04:27] you but that's your home that's what you
[04:29] know that's where that's where family is
[04:32] and so you're forced to to leave for
[04:35] various
[04:36] situations and um and then you're forced
[04:38] to leave your your family and I'm kind
[04:41] of finding myself uh in in that
[04:44] situation too but like the other way
[04:46] around where I I came to Canada when I
[04:48] was a child and then I set Roots here
[04:52] always thinking you know I'm I'll go
[04:54] back I set Roots here my wife's Canadian
[04:57] and my kids are Canadian and they've set
[05:00] routes here and then for me to now go
[05:03] back to El Salvador to a place where I
[05:06] feel home I'm also leaving another place
[05:09] where I feel like it's home and then my
[05:11] kids have known as home and so it's
[05:15] difficult to to leave right and so my
[05:18] goal is to try to make it so that um
[05:21] they feel like they have both homes
[05:23] right and the impossibility before was
[05:26] that we couldn't go to El Salvador and
[05:28] enjoy ourselves
[05:30] because it was too dangerous and they we
[05:32] really couldn't embrace it as a home and
[05:35] then through the shift and the
[05:36] transformation that the country has
[05:39] undergone it has allowed us to reconnect
[05:43] and uh and especially maybe not so much
[05:46] for me but definitely for for my wife H
[05:50] to begin to love the country and uh and
[05:54] for my kids who've always sort of like
[05:56] in their heart been like oh I'm Salvador
[05:58] and I love the country but I've never
[06:00] been there and I I know it's dangerous
[06:02] and and now we can transition into a
[06:04] into a moment where where that's now a
[06:08] um a reality and then we can begin to
[06:10] make it home right and then and then at
[06:13] a certain point in in time you know if
[06:16] if we are if we have a second home in El
[06:19] Salvador a place to be um you know they
[06:22] can go there and they can be just as
[06:24] comfortable as they are in Canada right
[06:26] so it's kind of reversing the brain
[06:30] train of of El Salvador I heard so many
[06:33] stories already of people that moved
[06:36] away from El Salvador to Canada America
[06:40] to Spain to all kinds of places because
[06:43] they didn't feel home they didn't feel
[06:45] safe there uh and most of them that I
[06:48] talk to now is like yeah I'm either
[06:51] already back or thinking of going back
[06:53] or I want to go back at some point so uh
[06:56] it it's it's just from that standpoint
[06:58] already a success of getting the people
[07:02] that left uh back uh and if if nuk only
[07:07] achieved that that in in a loan as a
[07:11] loan is already a major success in my
[07:14] eyes mhm yeah no I mean it's quite uh
[07:18] remarkable what's happening and I can
[07:21] tell you that I don't think that
[07:24] I I ever thought in the past that this
[07:28] is where I would be
[07:30] I thought maybe like this the you know
[07:32] like where we are now my kids would see
[07:34] it or I would see it in my old age but
[07:37] it's quite remarkable so I don't know
[07:41] it's interesting also with new perfect
[07:44] um before we get into elab to deep I
[07:46] want to touch on because it just
[07:48] happened this week with with America
[07:50] also slowly moving towards Bitcoin uh or
[07:55] maybe moving towards Bitcoin at least
[07:57] the president has now High more highly
[07:59] likelihood than Biden to to bitcoin how
[08:02] do you how did you see that if you're
[08:04] jumping like Canada and uh Salvador in
[08:08] between is America if I got the map
[08:10] right yeah
[08:13] yeah how is that that part going with
[08:16] America and and how do you see it those
[08:18] moves that they are making
[08:20] now well you know like I
[08:22] think politics in America matters so
[08:26] much for the entire world even if we
[08:29] think we're disconnected from it I mean
[08:31] they are the major power in the world
[08:34] right now and um and I think the
[08:39] change in in the presidency and not only
[08:43] the presidency but the Senate and it
[08:45] looks like they're going to take
[08:46] Congress as
[08:47] well
[08:49] um I mean the way that I see it is is
[08:53] inconsequential to bitcoin it like
[08:57] it's they have so many other things that
[09:00] um as a country they need to tackle and
[09:03] I think that the the rejection of the
[09:06] democratic party was uh was pretty solid
[09:10] especially among those uh swing states
[09:13] where you know you need to win those if
[09:15] you're going to if you're going to take
[09:16] control of of the you know the the
[09:19] executive and and and the Senate and and
[09:21] Congress right
[09:23] um and it what I found interesting was
[09:26] that you know for so many years
[09:29] we kind of had this um notion that the
[09:33] Democratic party was the the party of of
[09:36] the people right the the party of the
[09:38] working class the party of
[09:42] inclusion and I think Bernie Sanders and
[09:44] by the way there's a lot of U bitcoiners
[09:47] who are former former Bernie sander
[09:49] Democrats you'd be surprised like
[09:51] there's so many and um how he wrote a
[09:56] letter and essentially he said like
[10:00] this is the Democratic party's
[10:02] fault you know I don't want to say
[10:06] fatalistic that like that Trump is going
[10:08] to be so bad for the US or the world
[10:13] it's not I mean he had a presidency and
[10:15] we we had the the least incidents of of
[10:20] geopolitical uh you know disputes and
[10:23] wars and and everything so so you
[10:26] know but but what Bernie Sanders
[10:28] essentially said was
[10:30] like they turn away from you because you
[10:32] turn away from them and
[10:35] so and
[10:37] now the flip the flip side of that coin
[10:41] is that you know the Republicans have
[10:43] always been the party of of the ruling
[10:46] class and the elites right who
[10:49] have you know
[10:52] for um a better part of their existence
[10:55] never really cared about um you know
[10:58] what the
[10:59] average folk in the US uh is doing other
[11:03] than you know uh let's let's maybe get
[11:07] the economy going and and uh you know
[11:10] what's good for my business and and and
[11:12] my my influence and um in the Republican
[11:16] party so that I can um uh be wealthier
[11:19] right and and that's fine I mean that's
[11:21] how capitalism works right but I think
[11:25] you know the the the Republican parties
[11:27] at some at some point lost to support of
[11:30] uh workingclass folk because they really
[11:33] weren't passing laws that benefit people
[11:36] and I think that this is the lesson not
[11:38] just
[11:39] for uh you know democracy in the US but
[11:44] democracy everywhere is like if you get
[11:46] elected you you have to look after the
[11:49] people who elected you if you turn away
[11:51] from that then you're you're going to
[11:54] get dispatched and and and they're going
[11:57] to like somebody else and I think this
[12:00] is what's maybe a little bit unique
[12:02] about um El Salvador is that I think
[12:05] that for the large part the you know the
[12:08] government there is trying to do what
[12:11] what it set out to to do but before we
[12:14] get too deep into there I think that in
[12:17] terms of
[12:18] Bitcoin what's happened in the US is
[12:22] really not what we think is going to
[12:24] happen I think if they move they're
[12:26] going to move slowly they're they're
[12:29] it's going to be incremental they can
[12:31] upend the their entire economic and
[12:35] financial system to accommodate
[12:38] bitcoiners I think I think we live in a
[12:40] bit of a fantasy world if we think that
[12:42] the change can be can be drastic it it's
[12:46] it's not it has to be incremental like
[12:48] so much of what exists today depends on
[12:51] that Financial system that it has to be
[12:55] incremental and very thought out very
[12:58] well thought out right
[12:59] um you can't just unplug from it I mean
[13:02] I I think I mean you know some people
[13:05] are of that mindset and that's fine I'll
[13:08] I'll personally be okay but so many
[13:10] people wouldn't be right so it would
[13:13] affect so many people if they all of a
[13:15] sudden unplug from The Current financial
[13:17] system but I think that uh you know
[13:20] there's some certain things that they
[13:21] can do like you know capital gains you
[13:24] know um things like that being able to
[13:27] spend your Bitcoin without without
[13:29] incurring that that Capital games uh
[13:32] gains um um event right things like uh
[13:37] maybe there's a threshold right like
[13:39] under a thousand bucks or whatever you
[13:41] know there's some practical things that
[13:42] you can begin to do but um you know
[13:47] if if it was that
[13:50] significant we would be at uh at over
[13:54] 100K per coin today USD right it is over
[13:58] 100k per coin uh Canadian but uh but USD
[14:02] like it you know if you know and and
[14:05] this is me just you know giving my
[14:08] opinion I have I'm just um I'm just a
[14:11] regular guy with an opinion so I'm not
[14:13] an expert I'm I'm not a financial expert
[14:15] but but I think that like if the event
[14:18] of Donald Trump taking power over over
[14:21] the presidency was so good for Bitcoin
[14:25] it would have pumped way more than it
[14:27] has right so I think a lot of this was
[14:29] already built in like this is no no
[14:31] surprise I think a lot of us knew that
[14:33] this was the way that it was going to go
[14:35] you could see it and um and so I think
[14:39] the the price change was already built
[14:42] into
[14:43] it absolutely and it's um it's
[14:46] interesting when we talk about America
[14:49] in moving towards Bitcoin because you're
[14:52] 100% right with the slow incremental
[14:54] moves um but those slow incremental
[14:58] moves have like a massive Force like if
[15:01] if they uh buy just with like 1% of the
[15:05] yearly Revenue um Bitcoin that's like a
[15:10] million Bitcoin if at the current price
[15:12] obviously if they actually do that
[15:14] bitcoin price would M skyro and they
[15:16] would not get there and they would need
[15:18] to buy way more so it's it's a question
[15:19] if they even get to like a million
[15:21] Bitcoin or two million Bitcoin whatever
[15:23] they they aim for I think Robert Kennedy
[15:24] Jun even wants for a million Bitcoin
[15:27] which is crazy but though
[15:29] um like small moves for them like pretty
[15:34] pretty huge steps like that's like uh
[15:37] that that's like if if micro strategy um
[15:41] a mediumsized publicly traded company I
[15:44] would say uh can acquire 250,000 Bitcoin
[15:49] uh think about what America could do
[15:51] with like a small percent of of of their
[15:54] resources so uh you're 100% right that
[15:57] America will not do anything irrational
[16:01] huge in the next few years but something
[16:04] like raising capital gains tax and like
[16:06] saying let's keep the Bitcoin we have
[16:09] and let's buy like a little bit every
[16:11] year that little bit
[16:13] is that's a hu hu huge amount of number
[16:18] uh but for me the bigger thing that
[16:23] happens if now like now Trump is elected
[16:27] but he's not yet president I think it's
[16:30] like January something uh then then he
[16:33] probably needs a little bit time and so
[16:35] like till something actually happens
[16:37] this takes time but the the bigger thing
[16:40] for me is now what if like um smaller
[16:45] countries uh that look now towards
[16:49] America and they're like okay um America
[16:53] might do something and we are a smaller
[16:55] country so like we we should front run
[16:59] them like we we should do something now
[17:01] before they do it obviously El Salvador
[17:04] was the most Visionary which moved so so
[17:08] early um but that that that's kind of
[17:11] incredible like I did not expect that at
[17:13] all like when I moved into Bitcoin in
[17:16] 2020 I had like a timeline for me um and
[17:19] I thought like 2095 I was very bearish
[17:22] 2095 the first small counties do
[17:24] something uh it happened a year after I
[17:27] came into Bitcoin and surprised me uh
[17:30] and now like in 2084 with with America
[17:33] the small moves but the the signal to
[17:37] all the small countries now that haven't
[17:40] explored Bitcoin but really need it
[17:42] because they are maybe dependent on US
[17:44] dollar and they see also the positive
[17:46] example that El Salvador or pan however
[17:50] you say pan I heard it some somewhere
[17:53] last time a little bit different um is
[17:55] doing I think that that ripple effect uh
[17:58] could could really be huge and could set
[18:01] up this this fear of missing out of a
[18:04] country of a nation state level um in a
[18:07] in a huge sense at least that's what I
[18:10] think the significance of that could be
[18:13] I mean yeah we have to see what was
[18:15] actually happening and and if Donald
[18:16] Trump actually does what uh he said but
[18:20] his his administration has some good
[18:22] people in there and let's see if if he
[18:25] delivers uh but the bigger thing is now
[18:29] El Salvador already has those things
[18:31] like Sal El Salvador is already
[18:34] delivering in a good sense so um do you
[18:38] have on that final thoughts and then we
[18:39] can move into uh El Salvador how the
[18:42] adoption actually is there yeah um I
[18:47] think that
[18:48] um the US even
[18:51] under
[18:53] Biden is is probably doing a lot more
[18:56] behind the scenes that they that they
[18:59] actually can talk about I mean I mean
[19:02] we've be naive to think that they're
[19:03] they're not
[19:04] actually you know looking at it from
[19:07] from all angles because it's very easy
[19:10] for us to say oh they're stupid you know
[19:12] they're at the end of the fourth turning
[19:14] you know
[19:16] but you know and and it's it's what we
[19:20] see we're just seeing the top of the
[19:22] iceberg behind what's happening I think
[19:24] that there there are you know some
[19:28] people who who may be preparing for all
[19:32] possible
[19:33] situations and if they're not then we're
[19:36] better off for it because we got a head
[19:37] start on them but um but I think that um
[19:42] they it's not just the the US I think
[19:46] all major superpowers are are kind
[19:49] of in my opinion quietly following the
[19:54] same recipe that s
[19:57] Satoshi um recommended you know that
[20:00] that in case it takes off you you might
[20:02] want to get
[20:04] some yeah and uh some of them do that
[20:08] with confiscating it as as the US is
[20:11] doing we always say like oh yeah they
[20:13] have Bitcoin no they don't like they
[20:15] stole Bitcoin from people and and they
[20:17] keep them I don't know if that's
[20:19] actually having Bitcoin they stole it of
[20:21] yeah they control it but that's I don't
[20:23] know I would not say they have Bitcoin
[20:25] even though yeah they have Bitcoin it's
[20:27] it's kind of weird um so now El Salvador
[20:30] what is the uh I'm really pumped because
[20:34] actually um in like I don't know 36
[20:38] hours or 48 Hours something like that my
[20:40] plane is leaving
[20:41] actually yeah I'm flying to Salvador by
[20:44] the way I'm I'm coming for two hours
[20:46] because I have a a layover in in Canada
[20:49] so I'm I'm flying from Austria to Canada
[20:52] to to El Salvador because that was
[20:54] apparently the best flight to take yes
[20:57] it is uh and yeah so I'm I'm soon coming
[21:01] to Salvador and soon finally can check
[21:03] it out myself uh but how how is El
[21:06] Salvador Bitcoin adoption uh what are
[21:08] some maybe misconceptions that people
[21:10] have about it uh and and and how is it
[21:12] going from the things that that that we
[21:17] know
[21:19] so in opinion around Bitcoin adoption El
[21:23] Salvador varies from like it's a
[21:25] complete failure to like maybe an over
[21:28] bullish um uh Outlook where oh you know
[21:33] adoption is 100% right because and and
[21:37] this is true there there is 100%
[21:40] awareness everybody in the country knows
[21:44] what Bitcoin is they may not know how to
[21:47] use it or they may not transact it but
[21:49] everybody
[21:51] knows whereas you know even here in
[21:54] Canada in Austria the US there's people
[21:58] who don't
[21:59] probably never even heard of Bitcoin
[22:00] still and um but that's not the case in
[22:03] El Salvador but I think you know the
[22:06] reality is somewhere in the middle right
[22:08] where um
[22:11] uh when Bitcoin became legal tender I
[22:15] would say that 99% of salvadorians have
[22:18] not even heard of Bitcoin at that point
[22:22] and so how can you expect the population
[22:25] to begin to transact use and store their
[22:30] their wealth and their Savings in
[22:32] Bitcoin when they haven't even heard of
[22:34] it and so that there is a process in
[22:36] place and um and I think that um that
[22:41] that process we have to look at it from
[22:45] the lens of a low time preference which
[22:48] means that it's not going to happen
[22:50] overnight even if you put all the
[22:51] policies in place to enable it in the in
[22:54] the technological
[22:56] infrastructure and uh and you invite
[22:59] Bitcoin companies to set up shop in El
[23:02] Salvador there'll still be um you know
[23:05] people who won't get it or who um won't
[23:09] use it um you know it it is fairly easy
[23:13] to
[23:14] transact in USD and um and I mean fiat's
[23:19] easy you don't have to you
[23:22] know especially to spend it because
[23:25] fiat's there for the sole purpose of you
[23:28] to use it and spend it right and uh
[23:31] whereas Bitcoin right now is at a point
[23:35] in time where you know people are
[23:38] storing it right and and so and people
[23:41] don't want to spend it and so then in
[23:44] Salvador you can spend it but people are
[23:47] still preferring to to use the lower
[23:50] form of money which is Fiat which is the
[23:52] USD and so um but I think that um
[23:59] I'm very hopeful I'm actually involved
[24:02] with uh an organization called me
[24:04] Bitcoin which means my first Bitcoin and
[24:07] it's a group of bitcoiners locals as
[24:09] well as expats that came together and
[24:12] developed a uh a
[24:14] curriculum uh and uh a student workbook
[24:18] it's a 10-week course that teaches
[24:21] people from
[24:23] zero to knowing what Bitcoin is and how
[24:27] to transact it how to store it in in 10
[24:30] weeks and and and this was developed
[24:32] from the ground up there is no
[24:34] government support but what has happened
[24:36] is that it's had so much success in
[24:39] teaching young people high school age
[24:42] students that now the government has
[24:45] taken that model and implemented it in
[24:48] the public school curriculum and now
[24:51] even some private schools are teaching
[24:53] it as part of their financial literacy
[24:56] which is great because which country in
[24:59] the world is teaching Bitcoin as part of
[25:01] their financial literacy most most
[25:04] school boards around the world don't
[25:06] even teach financial literacy they teach
[25:08] other things uh but not financial
[25:11] literacy which is one of the most
[25:13] practical things that you'll need in
[25:14] your life but in El Salvador bitcoin's
[25:17] part of that um and uh and from that
[25:20] sense I think that if we take a low time
[25:24] preference approach we are setting
[25:29] young people for a better future and for
[25:33] um we're setting them up with the
[25:34] knowledge for Success into the future so
[25:38] by the time Canada adops Bitcoin in some
[25:42] way or um you know Europe begins to make
[25:46] headways into into Bitcoin El Salvador
[25:48] will be fully onboarded right this is
[25:51] not going to happen tomorrow but the
[25:53] things that we're doing today are
[25:55] setting the country up um to be
[25:58] successful and and I I like it that it's
[26:01] happening in a very decentralized manner
[26:03] I mean yes sure the government's kind of
[26:05] uh adopted some of what started um from
[26:09] the ground up you know from from just
[26:11] folks regular folks trying to to gain
[26:14] more knowledge and so in that sense I
[26:16] think Bitcoin is going very well right
[26:20] so um but but yeah I mean there will be
[26:23] critics and I not one to not listen to
[26:27] the critics we have we have to listen to
[26:30] the critics because if you don't listen
[26:32] to the critics then you can't improve
[26:35] and so whether is valid criticism and
[26:38] not just talking or you know
[26:40] mudslinging then you take that and and
[26:43] you implement it and you make better
[26:45] right failure is is only failure if you
[26:49] don't take the lessons to improve and I
[26:51] think that's what a lot of these folks
[26:53] down on the ground are doing they're
[26:55] listening they're they're seeing where
[26:57] they can improve and and the the
[26:59] curriculum is it's it's on its um second
[27:02] iteration now and there's going to be a
[27:04] third and a fourth but it's way better
[27:07] i' I've been teaching it here in Canada
[27:08] and and it's so good people enjoy uh all
[27:11] of the activities and what's unique
[27:13] about it is that and this is one of one
[27:17] of the biggest um challenges around um
[27:20] understanding Bitcoin is that people
[27:21] want to understand Bitcoin from the
[27:25] point of view of where it is in in in
[27:27] the market what price of one Bitcoin per
[27:30] your Fiat um currency is and how they
[27:33] can um invest in it and make
[27:36] money but really in order to understand
[27:38] Bitcoin you need to understand money and
[27:40] so many people don't understand what
[27:42] money is and so if you don't understand
[27:44] money then you're not really going to
[27:46] understand Bitcoin and the course takes
[27:49] you from understanding what money is to
[27:53] then see what the flaws of the current
[27:56] money system are to
[27:58] than having the um the need and the urge
[28:03] to move into
[28:05] Bitcoin that's super interesting I love
[28:08] also the uh approach of like educating
[28:12] the kids because that's the most
[28:13] effective way to make it sustainable
[28:15] long term um and for me it's interesting
[28:19] also like how much of
[28:22] the uh like Bitcoin has different uh
[28:26] adoptions that it goes through like
[28:28] first is like the
[28:29] treasury um where you like exchange your
[28:33] main treasury which might be stocks
[28:37] might be US dollar might be Euros might
[28:39] be whatever it is to all the Bitcoin
[28:42] that's what I did on on a personal level
[28:45] I dropped all stocks all everything else
[28:47] that I had completely all in Bitcoin the
[28:49] second step is a little bit harder for
[28:51] me because I'm an Austria because uh
[28:53] it's it's the medi of exchange part of
[28:55] like okay let's let's just um exchange
[28:59] the value that I have also directly in
[29:01] Bitcoin let's get paid in Bitcoin that's
[29:04] um let pay in Bitcoin the paid in
[29:05] Bitcoin already uh I I do already have
[29:09] to certain extents with my sponsors
[29:11] actually like most u fair amount of my
[29:15] um uh income of the company is now in
[29:18] Bitcoin which is really cool uh but
[29:20] paying in Bitcoin that's kind of hard
[29:24] that's the that's the hard part uh and
[29:26] the last part would be then you have all
[29:29] your wealth in Bitcoin uh maybe you have
[29:32] a house and stuff like that but that
[29:33] doesn't count but all your liquid net
[29:35] worth is in Bitcoin you exchange
[29:37] everything in Bitcoin and then then the
[29:39] last part of that is you also think in
[29:41] Bitcoin like you you use Bitcoin as your
[29:43] unitive account so for me to have 100%
[29:47] Bitcoin adoption would be a country
[29:50] which has all his assets uh in in
[29:53] Bitcoin uh all his liquid assets in
[29:56] Bitcoin has all the unit of account
[29:58] accounts in in Bitcoin and uses almost
[30:02] uh only Bitcoin as a med exchange except
[30:05] when tourists come and they have to
[30:07] exchange stuff and stuff like that um
[30:10] obviously uh no country is even close to
[30:13] that uh El Salvador is the country that
[30:16] is closest to that um maybe uh Nigeria
[30:21] and and some other African countries are
[30:23] also coming closer to that but I think
[30:26] uh El salador is probably the the the
[30:28] that is closest to that um how far do
[30:32] you think El Salvador is to that vision
[30:35] and obviously you don't have a crystal
[30:37] ball but uh if you had to guess like
[30:40] when do you think it would be realistic
[30:43] that El Salvador might be eventually
[30:47] there uh like is is that like 20 years
[30:50] out is that 200 years out um
[30:53] obviously um nobody know really knows
[30:56] but do do you have a from the Insight
[30:58] that you have from the country a rough
[31:00] estimate where like that could around
[31:03] that time I could imagine uh that uh
[31:06] Salvador is at that place yeah it's hard
[31:08] for me to say but um like I think that
[31:11] as long as we're in price discovery mode
[31:14] and um the unit of account is not
[31:17] Bitcoin it we're still far away I think
[31:21] I think pricing things in Bitcoin and
[31:25] accounting in
[31:26] Bitcoin um are really really essential
[31:30] um in order for the full Bitcoin
[31:34] iation of of an economy right so and in
[31:40] even in circular economies like Bitcoin
[31:43] Beach um you know Bitcoin Berlin I don't
[31:47] know if you're going to go there but uh
[31:49] um it's it's it's a little town in in
[31:51] usulutan where my my dad's from uh
[31:54] called Berlin because um the uh the some
[31:58] of the settlers that went and uh and and
[32:02] uh um worked as a coffee Farmers there
[32:06] uh were originally from Germany and so
[32:08] they named it Berlin but even in those
[32:11] circular economies people are still
[32:16] um off- ramping and on ramping back to
[32:20] Fiat because at some point somebody
[32:22] doesn't accept Bitcoin for whatever they
[32:25] need right so but circular economies are
[32:29] so important and as long as we see uh
[32:34] more and more emerge and in El Salvador
[32:36] is actually a good example it begin with
[32:39] Bitcoin Beach then there's Bitcoin
[32:41] Berlin and then there's Bitcoin Lake
[32:44] over in Guatemala and and if more and
[32:48] more of these Bitcoin Eon uh circular
[32:50] economies begin to emerge then you begin
[32:52] to create a network where um you don't
[32:56] need to offramp
[32:58] from a a Bitcoin standard and
[33:02] so I think we're far away from that yet
[33:06] um I would say like 20 years maybe is
[33:11] even um a bit of an optimistic um um
[33:17] prediction but but at the same time you
[33:19] know like I never foresaw El Salvador's
[33:23] security improvements happen so quickly
[33:28] um even in my wildest dream so
[33:30] anything's possible like sometimes you
[33:32] know when you have either Black Swan
[33:34] events or or you begin to have like that
[33:38] um that impetus that um that momentum
[33:42] that is then in in adoption becomes
[33:45] exponential right and
[33:49] so you know I'm not sure if you've uh if
[33:53] you're familiar with um some some of the
[33:56] you know marketing text and and models
[34:00] around um adoption of of Technology but
[34:04] um you you have your innovators then you
[34:07] have your early adopters your late
[34:09] adopters and then your laggards right
[34:12] and somewhere between your innovators
[34:13] and your early adopters you have this
[34:15] Chasm and that and it's like it's like
[34:19] this Gap that just sometimes takes so
[34:22] long to happen between the people who
[34:25] are like wanting to you know make this
[34:28] thing happen and in the early adopters
[34:30] and I think that's where we are
[34:33] today despite all the many positive
[34:35] things happening around Bitcoin mostly
[34:38] to do with price to be quite honest
[34:40] right now but um we are in that Chasm
[34:45] right and um and so we just got to get
[34:48] over that Chasm and whether that Chasm
[34:50] is five years 10 years 20 years or 200
[34:54] years we don't know but um but but this
[34:58] is also a good thing because it it just
[35:00] lets people know that if they're
[35:02] considering Bitcoin you know to to save
[35:06] and and to to begin their Journey like
[35:08] you're still in that innovators and or
[35:10] or at least the the the very beginnings
[35:14] of that early adopter stage I partnered
[35:18] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[35:21] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[35:24] saw created by anyone look at that
[35:27] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[35:30] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[35:32] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[35:36] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[35:38] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[35:42] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[35:45] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:48] watch collections you have the date of
[35:51] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[35:54] there and of course also the block
[35:56] height and which which Epoch we are
[35:59] currently in I love the level of detail
[36:02] they put in in this masterpiece and make
[36:04] sure to check out those amazing coin
[36:07] vigilante time pieces down in the
[36:10] descriptions I love those watches so so
[36:13] much if you watch or listen to my
[36:15] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[36:17] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[36:20] the most important step is to keep the
[36:23] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[36:26] wallet my personal recommendation for
[36:27] hard wallet is the bit box it's super
[36:30] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[37:24] free call to find out how you can level
[37:26] up your for
[37:28] sovereignty that's super interesting I I
[37:31] talked in Amsterdam about around the
[37:33] future of Bitcoin and we picked the year
[37:37] 2050 uh which is a super interesting
[37:39] year because it is now Bitcoin is 15
[37:42] years old in 2050 is in 26 years that's
[37:46] like the whole history of Bitcoin plus
[37:47] 11 years so a lot of things can happen
[37:50] in that time frame and it's also
[37:53] interesting how you said with the kids
[37:55] that are learning now Bitcoin and in the
[37:58] in the school how how old are they 15 18
[38:02] 12 so so they would be from 13 to uh 19
[38:08] that's that's your average high school
[38:10] year um age then then let's take 15 as
[38:14] as like the average of uh there if if
[38:16] those 15y old kids are now learning so
[38:19] much about Bitcoin they seeing all the
[38:21] benefits they see it grow over the next
[38:23] years and they're now 15 in 2050 that's
[38:27] six years from now then they are
[38:30] 35 41 if I did the math correct so
[38:34] they're over 40 then uh in in in 26
[38:37] years from now I think I I have a hard
[38:41] time believing if those kids who learn
[38:43] now this hardcore Bitcoin stuff if they
[38:46] learn Bitcoin from the ground up and
[38:48] they see Bitcoin rising and shining over
[38:51] 26 years I think they will be extremely
[38:54] intolerant to anything else in Bitcoin
[38:57] uh they think be like why should I use
[38:59] anything else like why should I even
[39:02] touch this US dollar coin uh when I can
[39:06] do it in Bitcoin and there will be so
[39:08] many shops that the few shops that might
[39:10] resist and say like ah I don't like this
[39:12] this Bitcoin things the bitcoiners will
[39:14] come in there and say like oh I want to
[39:16] pay with Bitcoin uh and and or like hey
[39:21] um what does that cost and they're like
[39:22] yeah that and that and oh how can I pay
[39:24] and and they don't accept Bitcoin they
[39:26] will walk out they like oh yeah I will I
[39:29] will go to the restaurant down the
[39:30] street that accepts Bitcoin because I
[39:32] only have Bitcoin so I obviously cannot
[39:35] consume anything here so um the merchant
[39:37] adoption and those Network effects I
[39:40] think that that's why I said it before I
[39:42] think it's extremely clever to have
[39:45] education in the school because that's
[39:47] how you make it sustainable uh if if you
[39:49] don't have the education in in the
[39:51] school education in in the for the
[39:54] populars it gets really hard to
[39:57] um really keep the Grassroots movement
[40:01] uh going sustainable you always fight an
[40:04] uphill battle but once you have this
[40:07] education once you have all the podcasts
[40:10] all the um seminars all the classes all
[40:16] the books like everything that is around
[40:18] education that you can have uh that's
[40:21] where uh the real power lies then
[40:24] because from an educated standpoint
[40:27] Bitcoin is just the best form of of of
[40:29] money so we we only have to fight for
[40:33] more education we don't have to fight
[40:35] for Bitcoin we just have to fight to
[40:38] educate people on the topic of money and
[40:40] make them aware that there's Bitcoin
[40:42] because naturally they will tend towards
[40:44] Bitcoin if they educated and are aware
[40:47] of Bitcoin so I think it's a very clever
[40:49] move and um I I would not be shocked if
[40:54] uh El Salvador is um leading the way and
[40:57] is the first country to to come to that
[41:01] um future and it's 2050 maybe a little
[41:04] bit before little bit late uh please
[41:07] hold me accountable I'm already looking
[41:09] forward to the the Clips in 26 years
[41:11] from now where I'm like hey no it's not
[41:12] still not there but I don't know I I
[41:16] like that date actually I like that year
[41:18] 2050 I think I think that's in yeah
[41:22] that's probably kind of something to
[41:24] shoot for right the the real the 2050
[41:28] you know and uh it's it's interesting
[41:32] because there's this popular saying you
[41:34] probably heard it we overestimate what
[41:38] we can do in one year but we
[41:40] underestimate what we can do in 10 years
[41:43] and 26 years is 2.6 times as much as 10
[41:48] years so that's it's it's a long
[41:50] freaking time A lot can happen uh like
[41:55] go back 26 years from now uh it's uh
[41:58] it's actually 1998 it was exactly my
[42:03] birth year I'm exactly 26 years old so
[42:06] there uh Google was born uh exactly 26
[42:10] years from now uh and Google is kind of
[42:12] already slowly dying off again so a lot
[42:16] of things can happen in that time frame
[42:18] I think that that's the main message
[42:20] that I wanted to uh to to get across uh
[42:23] here uh to to the people because I think
[42:26] people say like oh yeah in 100 years
[42:29] maybe in 200 years no I don't think that
[42:31] takes that long that's just crazy that
[42:34] Google's that that
[42:36] all now that you say that I remember
[42:39] when um a friend of mine um because I
[42:42] think I was using Yahoo at the time uh
[42:45] for search engine and he said to me well
[42:48] you should just use Google and I'm like
[42:50] what what are you talking about I like
[42:53] no just like way better search engine
[42:55] and I went and checked that out I'm like
[42:57] oh yeah this is awesome this is way
[42:58] better you know and that that was 26
[43:01] years ago oh my God H I was I was wor I
[43:06] was yeah
[43:09] crazy yeah as you can see here September
[43:12] 27 uh I I know it because I'm September
[43:16] 9th so go is almost exactly as old as I
[43:19] am so that's why I remember it that uh
[43:23] that good otherwise I would not know how
[43:25] you're a little bit older than Google
[43:28] so that's crazy yeah but I I agree I I
[43:32] think that uh um that is a good year to
[43:35] shoot for and and I think like if you
[43:38] think about the things that El Salvador
[43:40] is doing in terms of their laws and how
[43:44] they're setting up their entire economy
[43:46] the the vision was to be the hub for the
[43:51] future economy a and and I think they're
[43:56] doing that again it's not apparent
[43:58] because you you pass a law here you pass
[44:00] a law there and laws are boring who's
[44:04] reading them all but they're they're all
[44:06] kind of setting themselves up for that
[44:11] bitcon hyper bized future that we
[44:15] envision
[44:16] and and again you know like I think that
[44:20] um some of the things that are that that
[44:22] are happening and and that they're
[44:24] they're
[44:25] envisioning they're not happening as
[44:28] quickly like as quickly as we want them
[44:30] like some people are like well where's
[44:31] Bitcoin City we were promised a Bitcoin
[44:34] City you know it's like well yeah like
[44:36] Rome was not buil in one day and neither
[44:39] will be Bitcoin City like you
[44:42] know there's so many things that you
[44:44] have to take into consideration
[44:46] including the displacement of people who
[44:49] actually live there right now um to to
[44:53] construct the city environmental impact
[44:57] of bringing infrastructure to the floor
[45:00] and Fauna of of that region there's so
[45:03] many many steps to to get to where we
[45:07] are but what the current government is
[45:12] is sort of modeling a lot of what
[45:14] they're doing is around how Singapore
[45:18] went from a crime
[45:21] riddled um city state in Asia that was
[45:27] predominantly based their and their
[45:29] economy was predominantly based around
[45:33] fishing to now the financial capital of
[45:36] Asia right and one of the wealthiest
[45:38] countries in the world right and uh and
[45:41] that didn't happen overnight and leanu
[45:44] actually uh implemented some of the very
[45:48] harsh um methods that uh the current
[45:52] selfing government is also
[45:54] implementing and uh you know and I know
[45:58] that that Garners some criticism but
[46:01] again you don't get there overnight and
[46:02] you don't get there by following the
[46:05] recipes of
[46:08] like what has what has been known to be
[46:11] recommended and not work and so then you
[46:14] know there's several steps to to get
[46:17] there and um yeah hope hopefully we get
[46:20] there I mean that's that's my hope
[46:21] that's kind of where you know why why
[46:25] I'm hoping I can
[46:27] build
[46:29] enough um resources and wealth to to be
[46:34] in a place where we all probably want to
[46:36] be
[46:37] right yeah and uh I also want to touch
[46:42] in a little bit of what Bitcoin could do
[46:46] for on on not a financial level uh but
[46:50] on a on a society level like what
[46:52] Bitcoin does with with people and I
[46:56] don't know in Salvador it's probably
[46:58] also hard to 100% say because not
[47:01] everything is contributed to bitcoin
[47:03] like that there are no no more gangs on
[47:06] the streets and stuff like that that
[47:08] that's not entirely up to bitcoin like
[47:11] that that's because n PUK also um
[47:15] um helped like n PUK did a a great job
[47:20] of of getting rid of the gangs it it's
[47:22] not yeah we adopting Bitcoin now we
[47:24] don't have crimes anymore so like uh
[47:26] that that's not not that's probably not
[47:29] it um but what did you see in like the
[47:32] the change in in the people uh what what
[47:36] has Bitcoin brought to El Salvador uh
[47:39] outside of just yeah we we're using a
[47:42] different kind of money now on maybe on
[47:44] a societal front maybe in individual
[47:46] peoples maybe you even have stories from
[47:50] them yeah so I mean I'm I'm going to
[47:53] challenge that idea a little bit I think
[47:56] that um
[47:57] uh when we all get into Bitcoin we all
[48:00] get into it because oh you know we
[48:03] just there's various reasons but you
[48:05] know generally it's because we want to
[48:07] make sure that our our money is being
[48:10] saved and in a way that you know it
[48:12] doesn't lose spending power and then we
[48:14] have more than we have today uh into the
[48:17] future right and I think you know
[48:20] perhaps that's how
[48:23] um El Salvador started but one
[48:28] cuz Bitcoin was adopted in
[48:32] 2021 but the gang problem was still
[48:36] there it it took almost a full
[48:41] year before that problem was um well on
[48:45] its way to being
[48:47] addressed and and what happened was in
[48:51] my opinion again these these are my
[48:52] opinions I have no you know I do have
[48:57] some sources but no no Knowledge from
[49:00] within the decision making corridors in
[49:04] El Salvador but what I infer from the
[49:07] whole situation was that well what good
[49:09] is it to have Bitcoin in our country as
[49:11] a legal tender if it's the murder
[49:14] capital of the
[49:15] world I mean that just further
[49:18] reinforces the the myth The Narrative
[49:21] that uh Bitcoin is for criminals right
[49:27] so Bitcoin changes your
[49:29] mindset and and I think that's kind of
[49:32] Where it All Began it's like what good
[49:34] is it to have this if we are the most
[49:37] dangerous place if nobody wants to come
[49:38] here we got to fix this situation so
[49:41] then then we can attract the best that
[49:44] we can
[49:45] attract foreign direct investment which
[49:47] is what we need you know El Salvador is
[49:49] a very small um country and actually I
[49:53] like to kind of like draw symbolisms
[49:56] around this just for fun I think they're
[49:59] pure coincidence but the country is
[50:02] 21,000 square kilometers right
[50:06] 21,000 we
[50:08] have more or less some say like there is
[50:12] various different levels of volcanoes
[50:15] you know from like a huge Caldera to
[50:17] just like you know un inactive volcano
[50:20] but but essentially we have 21 volcanoes
[50:24] in El Salvador right so I might I agree
[50:27] 25 others 19 but 21 right so there's a
[50:32] lot around a lot of symbolism around the
[50:34] the number
[50:36] 21
[50:38] but but that 21,000 square kilometers is
[50:41] very symbolic because that's not a lot
[50:44] of land there are states in the United
[50:47] States that are bigger than El Salvador
[50:51] okay and uh and so we can't we don't
[50:55] have oil we don't have enough land to
[50:58] produce coffee to compete with Brazil
[51:02] and other super coffee producers our
[51:06] coffee is very good it's but it's a very
[51:10] Niche product that it's very high
[51:14] quality but there's not enough of
[51:17] it we no longer produce cacao maybe just
[51:20] for local
[51:22] consumption in fact we have to import
[51:26] our own vegetables and fruits to feed
[51:29] the entire population there are farms
[51:31] and there are local farmers markets and
[51:34] and organic um Farms but there there's
[51:37] just not enough so Guatemala and
[51:39] Honduras and
[51:40] Nicaragua uh export a lot of the food to
[51:43] El Salvador our beef yes we have local
[51:46] beef producers but to feed all of our
[51:49] population we need to import our beef
[51:51] from Nicaragua which is very good beef
[51:53] actually it's it's it's pretty good beef
[51:55] um so the reality is that we I mean what
[52:00] is our value proposition to the
[52:02] world so it Bitcoin did kind of change
[52:06] our mindsets we had to really refocus
[52:09] about what like what we do have to offer
[52:11] to the world well we have beautiful
[52:13] beaches beautiful volcanoes beautiful
[52:16] mountains that we can hike up we have to
[52:19] increase our tourism because and yes our
[52:22] tourism doesn't have the infrastructure
[52:24] of say Costa Rica or
[52:27] Mexico but we need to get there and the
[52:31] very first in order to do that is to
[52:34] solve the crime problem if we want to be
[52:37] the financial capital of of the world
[52:39] the future Financial capital of the
[52:41] world based on a Bitcoin standard and we
[52:43] want our tourism to to to improve and
[52:48] and perhaps we want entrepreneurialship
[52:50] to to flourish because a lot of what was
[52:53] happening before is like I have this
[52:55] great idea about an Entre an
[52:57] entrepreneur this this great idea this
[52:59] great product uh these great Services as
[53:02] soon as I
[53:03] started the local gang would know that I
[53:06] have a business and they would come and
[53:08] and and and extort me and so what is the
[53:11] incentive for me if my margins are
[53:14] getting delivered straight to to the
[53:16] local gang uh that that is basically in
[53:19] control of of our
[53:21] neighborhood there's no incentive so the
[53:24] the first step was to to fix this
[53:26] security problem and and to fix the
[53:29] security problem you have to change your
[53:30] mindset because it just it's not about
[53:33] like we'll just throw everybody in jail
[53:35] this is one of the biggest misconception
[53:37] first of all we didn't even have enough
[53:40] jail space so there's a lot of things
[53:43] that had to take place reforming laws
[53:46] empowering the the the police
[53:49] enforcement um making sure that we got
[53:53] rid of corrupt judges uh making sure
[53:56] that the timing upon which you know the
[54:00] operation to cleanse the leadership of
[54:03] of all these gangs was
[54:05] precise because you didn't want them to
[54:08] escape or find Refuge somewhere else
[54:10] right there was like like an epic level
[54:14] of planning and execution in order to
[54:16] happen and that does not happen if you
[54:20] have a Fiat mindset so I mean all to say
[54:24] that yes you're right it's it's not all
[54:27] about Bitcoin but I think changing your
[54:30] mindset sometimes begin with you
[54:33] inquiring about Bitcoin and then when
[54:35] you find out what it's really all about
[54:37] it's a it's about not taking shortcuts
[54:40] it's about doing the hard work the proof
[54:42] of work do it all these
[54:45] Concepts reinforce all of the other
[54:48] things that we need to do around in in
[54:50] our lives in order to do that right so
[54:52] it doesn't make us perfect humans are
[54:54] fallible we're all like you know here we
[54:57] are in a podcast lecturing about stuff
[55:01] there are things that I'm a hypocrite
[55:03] about in my life that I tell people oh
[55:06] you should do this you and I'm not even
[55:07] executing on myself we are fallible and
[55:10] accepting that fallibility is part of
[55:13] changing that mindset which means that
[55:15] El Salvador is not perfect but we're
[55:17] trying to get there and uh and and yeah
[55:20] I mean uh so it's not all about Bitcoin
[55:23] but it kind of is I don't know if that
[55:25] makes sense
[55:27] it it makes a lot of sense and uh it's
[55:30] also like um like what comes first like
[55:33] do you need the right mindset to adopt
[55:35] Bitcoin or you got the right mindset
[55:37] with Bitcoin like like the the this this
[55:41] question in my head also like how much
[55:43] does Bitcoin change a person or did
[55:48] because the person was ready for Bitcoin
[55:51] uh discover like his his like there's a
[55:54] lot of questions for me and it's like um
[55:58] I see the Bitcoin community and there
[56:01] are so many great individuals in there
[56:04] um from like extremely sporty they are
[56:07] nerding out of diet they are so focused
[56:10] on being happy being fulfilled being
[56:13] with the family being um um yeah healthy
[56:17] and and all those great things and and
[56:19] they are Super Wise and super pride and
[56:21] I'm like wow this community is is great
[56:24] what if the whole world is like that um
[56:28] and and and there is kind of my question
[56:30] like is is the community so great
[56:34] because uh they got Bitcoin and sound
[56:37] money now or did the great Community
[56:39] found together because Bitcoin attracts
[56:43] that those great individuals to each uh
[56:46] to to the community and and then the
[56:49] question is like what if Bitcoin is the
[56:53] uh standard across the world where kind
[56:55] of that that's the main thing is the
[56:57] whole world then like the early Bitcoin
[56:59] Community or
[57:02] is was it just the early Community
[57:05] because we are like these early P
[57:08] pushers the passionate early
[57:11] revolutioner uh people that's kind of
[57:13] where I'm I'm still completely undecided
[57:16] honestly on that one how you think about
[57:20] that well you know money is an
[57:23] innovation right money is a tool and
[57:26] often following this uh me Bitcoin
[57:30] diploma we play this barter game and in
[57:33] the barter game we we give everybody uh
[57:36] like a a paper bag paper lunch bag and
[57:39] we put different items in this um in
[57:43] this lunch bag and and then they we put
[57:47] up something on the screen and say you
[57:49] got to get get a list of these items and
[57:52] you're supposed to barter with it right
[57:54] and then people begin to barter and we
[57:56] give 10 minutes you know uh sort of um
[57:59] aligning it to to the 10-minute blocks
[58:03] um in order to achieve this task and
[58:05] it's very hard I don't think I've ever
[58:07] run a workshop where somebody in in that
[58:11] first round uh achieves that task and
[58:15] then in the second round we introduce
[58:18] commodity money which is um we use
[58:21] coffee beans instead of a Coke cacao
[58:25] beans which I actually were used as a
[58:28] former currency in El Salvador um under
[58:31] the Maya and the and the Peels and the
[58:33] astec
[58:35] Empire so we use coffee to exchange and
[58:38] and and then something interesting
[58:41] happens when we follow that same round
[58:44] of or that second round of uh of
[58:47] exchange is that some people get how to
[58:50] price things in coffee beans and how to
[58:54] and and they begin to
[58:56] to trade in coffee others are still
[58:58] wanting to barter and they're like oh
[59:01] like the beans are not worth anything
[59:02] and it's like like no but the beans the
[59:05] the coffee beans are your money you can
[59:07] price things in it and and uh you know
[59:12] you eliminate the double wants incident
[59:15] by actually pricing things and um and
[59:18] then barely anybody has ever come out
[59:21] unless they cooperate and they pull
[59:23] their resources together which they do
[59:24] this in a peaceful enough coarse manner
[59:28] barely anybody uh does that and so why I
[59:31] asked the question what was the
[59:33] difference between the first round and
[59:35] the second round some people say like
[59:36] nothing there was it's still hard to to
[59:39] barter and and trade in beans other
[59:42] people say well it's way easier because
[59:44] I could price things in and beans so
[59:47] some people get it at first and others
[59:49] don't and what I say to to people is
[59:52] like this is exactly what's happening to
[59:54] to bitcoin right now there's a better
[59:57] form of money there's an evolution of
[59:59] the invention to facilitate trade but
[60:03] we're still defaulting to the old ways
[60:06] we're not really progressing until
[60:08] somebody shows us and then we see oh
[60:11] this is how you do or these are the
[60:12] benefits you know of pricing things in
[60:15] coffee beans rather than than trying to
[60:17] barter right and that's kind of where we
[60:20] are where we have this better form of
[60:22] money but not everybody is using it
[60:25] right and so just go going back to your
[60:29] question you know and and linking it
[60:30] back to this to these activities that we
[60:33] run is that um I think that um uh I
[60:39] think it's for me at least and I could
[60:42] be wrong is that right now Bitcoin is
[60:45] attracting a certain kind of
[60:48] individual that that is in alignment
[60:50] with so many things that that all of us
[60:54] are trying to seek
[60:56] and and and be inspired by and are
[61:00] driven by and we all have a common
[61:03] philosophy which is also weird
[61:06] because like I said earlier I find that
[61:10] a lot of bitcoiners are Bernie sander
[61:12] former Bernie sander
[61:14] Democrats and then you find like some
[61:17] people who are like very libertarian or
[61:22] Anarchist and then you also find very
[61:24] conservative people and like how can all
[61:27] these people with so
[61:29] many like with different political
[61:33] philosophies actually be in
[61:35] alignment around Bitcoin and they
[61:38] actually find that what their
[61:40] differences aren't all that great that
[61:43] they align in so many things and I think
[61:45] at this point that's what Bitcoin is
[61:47] doing at least for me is that and and
[61:50] meetups are so great because we just had
[61:52] a Meetup a couple days ago here and and
[61:55] and in the city that I live here in
[61:57] Canada and and um you know I said to one
[62:01] of our presenters is like isn't it this
[62:04] great we all get to meet in person and
[62:07] talk about this and we are all the right
[62:09] kind of crazy that like we feel
[62:12] comfortable talking to each other and we
[62:14] don't feel
[62:15] comfortable uncomfortable saying dumb
[62:18] things or like trying to offend anybody
[62:22] because we just get each other and I
[62:24] think that's point where we are at I
[62:28] think as as
[62:31] Bitcoin becomes oous and it
[62:37] expands we probably won't see that
[62:40] anymore but uh I'm okay with
[62:44] it it's interesting that was a beautiful
[62:48] description actually of of like what
[62:50] what Bitcoin could achieve in the world
[62:53] uh and and and how it could change
[62:56] um Society um a few more questions I
[63:00] have for for Salvador um you you brought
[63:03] up
[63:04] tourism and I imagine that tourism is
[63:09] significantly up just from like the
[63:11] bitcoiners oh yeah uh talking about it
[63:14] how uh uh are there any statistics of
[63:17] like how much is tourism up and it's
[63:19] like uh is it also feelable like do you
[63:23] actually feel it when you're in the
[63:24] country that tourism is significantly
[63:25] yep yeah yeah all of the above um I mean
[63:29] um the the UN actually uh has a an
[63:33] agency around uh tourism and they keep
[63:35] statistics and I know a lot of people
[63:37] are kind of skeptic about you know the
[63:38] UN statistics and but I mean
[63:41] like but but they are what they are and
[63:44] uh and and El Salvador also reports on
[63:47] on these numbers and um and uh El
[63:51] Salvador was uh one of the top five
[63:54] destinations in terms of growth um post
[63:58] pandemic and it's been like it's it's up
[64:01] there with with the greatest right now
[64:04] in terms of volume it's a little
[64:05] different because it's small country but
[64:10] um and and you see it uh the the revenue
[64:13] being
[64:14] generated it's felt throughout the the
[64:18] entire country and it's visible you
[64:21] would go to El
[64:22] Salvador pre
[64:24] [Music]
[64:27] 19 and you would not see one North
[64:31] American one
[64:34] European you would you just would
[64:36] not uh now you are there and you see
[64:40] lots of Europeans out abouts in San
[64:43] Salvador the streets you see them hiking
[64:45] like in like you know some people are
[64:47] like what is this person doing here in
[64:50] the mountains of chalatenango you know
[64:52] like they're just oh yeah we're hiking
[64:54] you see people from Africa you see
[64:56] people from Asia there is El Salvador
[65:00] used to be a Hidden Gem for
[65:03] Surfers and the entire Allure to El
[65:07] Salvador was that you
[65:08] had amazing waves all throughout the
[65:12] year and only the Risk Takers the
[65:14] Surfers those seeking the adrenaline
[65:18] high of Surfing would go to El Salvador
[65:21] because you get another dose of high
[65:24] which is like it's the most dangerous
[65:26] place in the world to get to these waves
[65:30] we got to go through like gang territory
[65:34] pay people off for safety and the reward
[65:38] is these amazing
[65:40] waves nobody has to do that anymore
[65:43] everybody can enjoy the country and and
[65:46] you know what the adrenaline high is
[65:48] still there because what you lose is
[65:50] that element of danger for your life and
[65:53] you gain
[65:56] the friendliness and the warmth of the
[65:59] people that are there trying to
[66:02] genuinely build connection with the
[66:06] tourist and friendships with bitcoiners
[66:09] and and the new people who have who have
[66:12] um given El Salvador an opportunity and
[66:16] so yeah I mean it's uh it's you can
[66:20] physically see it it's um it's it's
[66:24] there and um and I don't have any stat
[66:27] any recent stats with me but I did write
[66:30] a few uh articles on bitcoin magazine
[66:32] that that provide those stats so if you
[66:35] if you ever want to um um I think in the
[66:38] first and second year anniversary of El
[66:41] Salvador Bitcoin adoption I spit some of
[66:43] those stats on on on those Bitcoin
[66:44] magazine articles they're they're there
[66:47] for you to check out and I I actually um
[66:50] I referenced those sources uh straight
[66:52] to to the um to to the data that uh that
[66:56] backs it up so oh really cool thank you
[66:59] so much um one last thing is when
[67:03] Bitcoin adoption is high is Nostra
[67:06] adoption also higher than usual in in El
[67:09] Salvador Nostra is not very uh um uh
[67:14] well known in El Salvador and and again
[67:17] you know like I
[67:18] think you know Noster is a level of like
[67:24] um serey that a lot of people don't
[67:28] quite understand yet a lot of people are
[67:31] still relying on
[67:33] centralized social networks and
[67:36] centralized um data
[67:38] providers
[67:40] um I think that that element of
[67:45] sovereignty is still a bit of a ways
[67:49] away because and you know why it's
[67:52] because it
[67:54] requires um
[67:56] a level of technical knowledge that a
[67:58] lot of people don't have yet right um
[68:01] and perhaps even resources you know
[68:03] setting up your own note you know mo
[68:05] most the reties of most salvadorians
[68:08] they
[68:09] live you know hand to mouth which means
[68:12] that it it is difficult to save in
[68:14] Bitcoin because their needs are were
[68:18] still a a a country in recovery from the
[68:22] Civil War and the Gang Warfare
[68:26] and uh and it means that um still a lot
[68:29] of your income is is income that you
[68:32] have to use to to to pay to survive to
[68:36] to pay your day-to-day costs you know we
[68:38] are a a you know um a low GDP per capita
[68:42] country and so our propensity to to
[68:44] spend is higher than our propensity to
[68:46] save and and
[68:48] so I believe that Noster is
[68:53] facilitated when you have a higher
[68:55] propensity to save be because then then
[68:59] you have the time then you have the
[69:02] resources to invest in a
[69:04] node invest the time into knowing the
[69:07] technical knowhow
[69:09] about storing your data in a sovereign
[69:13] way and not releasing it to these social
[69:16] networks that basically act against your
[69:19] self best self-interest by selling your
[69:22] data and selling you crap you don't need
[69:25] with your own data you know um but my
[69:29] hope is that um as a country grows as
[69:33] these
[69:34] things uh develop and as Bitcoin
[69:38] adoption emerges then um this just
[69:44] becomes part of it and this is kind of
[69:45] where I I also feel like you know the
[69:48] the the non-custodial versus custodial
[69:51] Solutions in El Salvador can play
[69:53] together it's it can't be one or the
[69:55] other like I have no problem telling
[69:58] people just download blink or wallet of
[70:01] Satoshi it is custodial which means
[70:03] don't put a lot of money on there but in
[70:05] order to transact and do things dayto
[70:08] day these are great Solutions because
[70:10] you don't have to like think about
[70:11] opening up a Channel or or did with
[70:15] multiple other nodes and and manager
[70:18] channels like it's it's you don't have
[70:20] to worry about that it gets you on a
[70:22] Bitcoin standard yes you give up a
[70:24] little bit of your your sommery but you
[70:27] begin to to uh to begin your journey
[70:31] into Bitcoin which then will allow you
[70:34] to then step into that next level of
[70:36] sovereignty so I I love Noster um I have
[70:40] to again be uh uh be fallible in this
[70:45] regard and I and say that I don't use it
[70:49] as much having said that I I'm using
[70:52] Twitter uh or X whatever a lot less than
[70:56] I I did I I find that like there's just
[70:58] too much noise in there and it's better
[71:00] for my mental health just to be away
[71:02] from it and I'm very selective about
[71:05] what I do in social networks now and so
[71:08] I think I'm plugging all together is
[71:10] probably like the best form of
[71:12] sovereignty if you will like so and
[71:15] that's actually something you can do in
[71:17] parts of of El Salvador is unplug you
[71:19] know like I said internet connection is
[71:22] amazing but there's places where you can
[71:24] be away from
[71:26] everything very true and yeah tw Twitter
[71:31] is a big noisy Place uh and and very
[71:35] distractive I I try to always like stay
[71:39] away from it but uh as as I work like my
[71:42] my whole job is like social media and
[71:44] doing the podcast so for me it's really
[71:47] hard to make that
[71:48] cut and then then you're working
[71:51] something then you're switching to your
[71:52] feet and I'm like oh that sounds
[71:54] interesting oh that and then like 20
[71:56] minutes later I'm like where where did
[71:58] what what did I just do like uh that
[72:01] that's that's still like big distraction
[72:05] but it's uh it's it's great that Twitter
[72:09] moves uh a little bit more to freedom of
[72:12] speech a little bit more to sovereignty
[72:14] which forces also the other bigger
[72:16] platforms and then we have also Nostra
[72:18] so we have those exit Wes I think that's
[72:21] a that's a great um a great trend
[72:25] towards those those kind of things I
[72:28] love that a lot yeah perfect then uh one
[72:30] question that I asked every each and
[72:32] every one of my guests is what can we
[72:34] learn from you besides Bitcoin you
[72:39] know
[72:40] Bitcoin is a
[72:42] tool it is a tool for
[72:46] you to make sure that your time is
[72:50] respected your time that you put into
[72:52] work is respected and that you don't
[72:55] don't lose the value of that time that
[72:57] you put into work so that you can spend
[73:00] it on things that make your life easier
[73:05] and happier but at the end of the day is
[73:07] just a
[73:09] tool the most important thing about life
[73:12] is your time and your and how you spend
[73:14] your time you may want to spend it with
[73:17] family I was going to say f like family
[73:18] is important to me right but other
[73:21] people just they love their friends they
[73:23] love to be alone
[73:25] spend it how you want it time is the
[73:28] most precious thing it's the resource
[73:30] that we have the least of and every day
[73:33] we have even less and we really don't
[73:36] even know how much we have I think I
[73:38] have another 60 years you know but I
[73:41] really don't know I I could just have
[73:43] another five minutes right so Bitcoin is
[73:47] just a tool that helps you respect your
[73:50] time and get and and
[73:53] so don't go chasing after money don't go
[73:56] chasing after Bitcoin go chasing after
[73:59] the things that make you happy and
[74:00] Bitcoin is just a tool to do that I love
[74:04] that a lot really cool we have entered
[74:06] in in the podcast where the previous
[74:07] guest is asking a question for the next
[74:09] guest uh without knowing who the next
[74:11] guest actually is and your question from
[74:13] the previous guest is an interesting one
[74:15] what G7 Nation will be the first one to
[74:18] print money to buy Bitcoin officially oo
[74:22] that is a really good one because like
[74:24] I'm actually surprised nobody has done
[74:27] that yet
[74:29] right um I'm going to
[74:33] say that
[74:36] uh
[74:39] Japan amazing I I just put it up on the
[74:42] screen for because maybe people don't
[74:44] know who are G7 Nations uh G7 Nation
[74:49] includes Canada France Germany Italy
[74:52] Japan uh the United Kingdom and and the
[74:55] United States and I think the EU is
[74:58] always also with with them in the
[75:00] meeting as a no so like the EU is not
[75:03] like an official member of the G7 but EU
[75:06] is kind of like in those meetings uh I
[75:09] think so Japan is an interesting
[75:12] interesting choice it's hard to choose
[75:15] from here uh but yeah Japan is an an
[75:18] interesting one uh yeah yeah go ahead I
[75:21] was I was going to say like I have a
[75:23] rationale for that is they're printing
[75:26] so much money anyway so what who cares
[75:30] let's just print more more money to save
[75:32] ourselves
[75:34] right I I I loved uh how cythia Lumes is
[75:40] framing the Bitcoin strategic Reserve
[75:43] bill because she's framing it to hey hey
[75:46] America let's buy Bitcoin to pay off a
[75:50] little bit of depth later on with that
[75:53] that's a genius because it's really hard
[75:55] to argue against that uh so yeah that
[75:59] that that that's that's funny but yeah
[76:01] like really like going ahead and
[76:02] printing their own currency and buying
[76:04] Bitcoin I mean they have to do it kind
[76:06] of
[76:07] like people don't get it that they
[76:10] actually do it because once once it's
[76:13] out that like a Nations actually
[76:15] printing their own currency just to buy
[76:17] Bitcoin the whole trust in the currency
[76:19] is lost oh yeah but but I would say this
[76:23] if you were GNA do it take El Salvador's
[76:26] approach of dcing one Bitcoin per
[76:30] day so then you're only
[76:33] printing over you know probably won't
[76:36] get away with this for long but you know
[76:38] you're only printing a little bit every
[76:41] day to achieve that goal now Salvador
[76:44] can't do that because they don't have
[76:45] their own currency and they they have no
[76:47] ability to to print more USD but um
[76:51] Japan can so you're welcome Japan you're
[76:54] welcome
[76:55] [Laughter]
[76:58] so let's see let's come back in in 10
[77:01] years on this podcast and see who who
[77:03] was actually first but yeah Japan is an
[77:05] interesting uh is really cool thank you
[77:07] so much haime it is right yes
[77:12] Hae like because my chairman wants to
[77:14] say CH yeah yeah yeah well and have you
[77:18] have a great time in in El Salvador I
[77:21] won't be there for adopting this year
[77:23] but um many my friends will and and you
[77:26] will enjoy the country I I guarantee you
[77:29] befriend the people and um indulge in
[77:32] the food when you can I know that a lot
[77:34] of us bitcoiners are quite disciplined
[77:36] in things that we eat but it's it's okay
[77:38] to indulge every once in a while really
[77:41] cool thank you so I I will definitely do
[77:43] that and I'm
[77:45] a like I cook almost every day kind of
[77:49] the same thing and it's very boring uh
[77:51] but I love good food and I love trying
[77:54] new things out that's why I'm not that
[77:57] strict with uh diet so like uh I'm I
[78:01] don't have a lot of meat in my diet to
[78:02] be honest uh and I just like to try out
[78:05] new things like if if if I see something
[78:08] on the menu that I cannot even pronounce
[78:10] I probably take that because I just want
[78:13] to find out what what what the heck this
[78:15] is uh so in my home kitchen that's like
[78:18] almost a same thing every day but once I
[78:21] get out and once I go on menus I'm like
[78:23] okay what of those things I don't
[78:26] understand or I'm like what is that even
[78:28] that I probably take so I will try to
[78:31] get like okay what's the uh what's a
[78:34] Salvadorian food and and what what can I
[78:36] eat that's I'm really looking forward to
[78:37] that the famous one is pusas which is
[78:40] basically like um like a a flat corn
[78:44] tortilla uh so like a cornbread and in
[78:47] the middle it's filled in with um uh
[78:51] usually chicharon which is basically
[78:54] fried
[78:55] pork uh but um if you want a vegetarian
[78:58] option or or or not a vegetarian option
[79:01] but like a non-meat option like you can
[79:03] fill it with cheese and then they have
[79:05] vegetable ones too so so and you can get
[79:08] a mix one with or yeah another
[79:10] vegetarian options is the beans one so
[79:13] and there the mixed one has everything
[79:14] in it vegetables beans cheese chicharon
[79:18] you can even get fish and chicken ones
[79:20] which I'm not a big fan of myself
[79:23] personally but a lot of people like
[79:25] the one thing though if if you want if
[79:27] if you if you want
[79:30] treats uh Yuka Yuka or yaka it's like a
[79:35] cassava um like a root fried yuca is
[79:39] like amazing so it's it's just like a
[79:42] street Treat Street vendors sell it um
[79:45] you know so maybe don't try it on the
[79:48] first uh couple days let your you know
[79:51] stomach bacteria kind of like adjust to
[79:54] the country and uh and then go go for it
[79:57] so I will I will I will try my best to
[80:00] get the full El Salvadorian uh
[80:03] experience I I booked like the uh a full
[80:07] week of events I made the first day
[80:10] actually without events I'm like the
[80:12] first day is like uh I will probably
[80:15] sleep a lot because it's a long long
[80:16] flight uh and then I would just like
[80:18] stroll around uh the city uh and and
[80:21] take it very slow and then on the first
[80:24] day I think in the evening there's like
[80:26] a Prem um a pre PR yeah yeah the the
[80:32] graduation I think it is perfect I think
[80:34] that's the first event I I go to and
[80:36] then like there's every day uh a lot of
[80:38] events till till I fly back uh so I'm
[80:41] I'm really looking forward to to that
[80:43] that this podcast actually will come out
[80:45] like once once it's already done but I'm
[80:48] really looking forward to it if if you
[80:50] if you do get a chance go to the
