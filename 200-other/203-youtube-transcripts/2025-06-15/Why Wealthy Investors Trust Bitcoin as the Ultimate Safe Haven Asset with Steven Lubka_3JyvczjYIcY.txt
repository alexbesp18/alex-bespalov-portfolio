[00:00] Bitcoin has one of the best outlooks out
[00:03] of any asset. Gold is, you know,
[00:05] responds to financial markets and
[00:07] there's a million things that go on that
[00:09] will always provoke a reaction. Bitcoin
[00:12] will always respond to big market moves.
[00:14] Something that I would agree with, it's
[00:16] kind of a decoupling. Like it is it's
[00:17] kind of a very new relationship where
[00:20] Bitcoin could certainly function as a
[00:22] safe haven asset. People in that top 10%
[00:25] are very unhappy in America right now
[00:27] with all that's happened. Most people
[00:29] don't care. It you just have to have a
[00:31] little bit of a different view on giant
[00:33] sovereign superpowers that like tension
[00:36] and competition is the name of the game.
[00:38] If you can find an opportunity to
[00:40] improve your standing in the citizens of
[00:43] your nation, their quality of life, you
[00:44] do it. The only people I've ever heard
[00:46] talk about Triffin's dilemma were
[00:47] Bitcoiners. And now they're effectively
[00:50] talking about it as the highest level of
[00:52] uh American policy. So that's, you know,
[00:54] it's interesting to see.
[00:58] [Music]
[01:00] Hi Stephen, how are you doing?
[01:01] Everything fine on your end? Yeah, it's
[01:04] been uh you know quite the quite a
[01:07] couple weeks, you know, historic really,
[01:10] you know, living through it and uh it's
[01:12] been interesting just seeing uh the
[01:15] tectonic shifts, you know, in markets,
[01:18] in global dynamics, in politics. I mean,
[01:22] it's not often you can truly say that
[01:24] you're living through history, but uh we
[01:27] we truly are right now. And honestly,
[01:30] it's given me a lot of thoughts on not
[01:32] just what's happening, but almost like
[01:36] the meta context
[01:39] of how people navigate situations where
[01:44] there is a lot happening or there is
[01:46] like uncertainty. And and that's been
[01:48] one of the interesting parts for me in
[01:50] all of this is like uh watching people
[01:55] try to model and make sense of something
[02:00] which is both profoundly
[02:02] impactful and also profoundly uncertain.
[02:05] None of us have clear information. So I
[02:09] mean that's a whole topic but like that
[02:11] has been one of the most interesting
[02:12] parts to me um about the last uh couple
[02:16] weeks. interesting. Yeah, there's a a
[02:19] lot going on. Uh I mean it kind of
[02:21] started I mean if we zoom out uh this
[02:24] epoch overall has been completely crazy
[02:28] with we breaking 100k the ETFs coming
[02:31] into uh fruition. I mean it was a little
[02:33] bit before we started the epoch. Uh then
[02:36] strategic Bitcoin reserve Trump is
[02:37] elected. Uh now we seem we have a trade
[02:41] war with with China and America going
[02:43] on. Um what what's kind of one of your
[02:46] highlights? what what is kind of
[02:47] standing out for you in this this times?
[02:49] One of the
[02:51] things in many ways so much that is
[02:55] happening is a profound
[02:59] um confirmation
[03:03] for so many of the
[03:06] Bitcoin views, world views, right? Uh
[03:10] specifically what I mean is it was only
[03:12] after I got
[03:14] exposed to Bitcoin that I really heard
[03:18] people talking about putting a lot of
[03:21] attention into like Triffin's dilemma
[03:25] and the dynamic of the US dollar
[03:27] monetary system and the impacts that
[03:30] this had on America and on the globe and
[03:34] that this monetary order was a driving
[03:38] force
[03:40] in what I would call the transition of
[03:43] the US economy and the US political
[03:46] economy from the kind of golden era of
[03:51] the 1950s to
[03:52] 1970s to what we're experiencing today.
[03:57] And in America, and I know you're in
[03:58] Europe, but in America, there's a lot
[04:01] of discontent and
[04:05] dissatisfaction on the difference
[04:07] between what the shape of the economy
[04:10] today versus the shape of the economy in
[04:14] the 1950s. And this is something which
[04:17] unless you really look underneath the
[04:19] surface or you're living here directly
[04:21] experiencing it, it doesn't it's not
[04:23] immediately visible when you look at
[04:26] topline GDP growth, topline wealth
[04:30] growth, topline equities markets growth,
[04:32] right? There's this one view from the
[04:35] top using all the financial metrics
[04:38] where it's like the US is uh the richest
[04:41] best most successful country in the
[04:43] world and and and that and that is a
[04:46] true statement on those levels but it
[04:50] has had a hidden
[04:51] underbelly where there's been a huge
[04:54] divergence. People have called it a
[04:56] K-shaped economy where so much of that
[05:00] uh kind of effectively concentrates in
[05:02] the financial class and the top. And I'm
[05:05] by no means someone that's like wealth
[05:07] inequality is normal. It's natural. It
[05:10] is a
[05:12] innate outflowing of divergences in
[05:16] human capacity and many other factors.
[05:18] There's no world where you don't have
[05:20] it. But there are ways that systems can
[05:24] artificially reinforce it via just
[05:28] purely monetary dynamics. And that's
[05:31] what we've seen. We've seen this
[05:32] K-shaped economy where people whose
[05:36] careers or assets position them in such
[05:39] a way where they benefit from the global
[05:42] monetary standard have done very well.
[05:47] And the costs of that system have been
[05:50] increasingly borne by just normal
[05:54] workers and people who if you compare
[05:57] the like kind of real quality of life of
[06:00] the an normal American worker, can they
[06:03] afford a home? Can they afford a family,
[06:05] college, health care? These things are
[06:08] progressively less attainable. They're
[06:10] progressively more expensive relative to
[06:14] their earning capacity.
[06:16] And this is kind of this divergence that
[06:18] when people here are talking about this
[06:21] K-shaped economy or they're talking
[06:23] about um the changes in the US post the
[06:28] 50s to 70s period really like post the
[06:30] Nixon shock uh the the gold window
[06:33] closing like this is what they're
[06:35] highlighting and that was a roundabout
[06:37] way of saying this is something
[06:39] Bitcoiners were really vocal and focused
[06:42] on and was something I had never really
[06:44] encountered until I got into Bitcoin.
[06:47] And so it's fascinating to see this take
[06:49] center stage in this administration.
[06:52] This is very much the language that
[06:55] Trump that Bent that uh this whole admin
[06:58] Moran Steven Moran are using to say,
[07:01] "Hey, we want to take a stab at
[07:04] correcting this." And this is something,
[07:06] you know, Bitcoiners have been like,
[07:08] "Well, it's a Triffins dilemma problem.
[07:10] It's a US dollar as world reserve
[07:12] currency problem. it's inevitable as
[07:15] long as the dollar serves this very
[07:18] specific role. And so if you had a
[07:20] neutral reserve asset like Bitcoin, uh,
[07:23] as we once did with gold, um, some of
[07:26] these dynamics would start to reverse.
[07:28] And, you know, it's a fraught
[07:29] conversation with, you know, many
[07:31] details and nuance. But um what comes up
[07:35] for me most watching everything that's
[07:36] happening is the astonishingly way this
[07:40] the astonishing way that a seemingly
[07:43] niche and countercultural concern has
[07:46] taken center stage.
[07:49] Interesting. I just want to um uh
[07:52] there's a lot there's a lot of
[07:54] interesting things in there. uh uh first
[07:56] of all I think many are aware many might
[07:59] not be aware what is the truffins
[08:01] dilemma
[08:02] yeah absolutely so it's basically a
[08:06] uh the word for uh kind of an economic
[08:10] problem that a man I believe Robert
[08:12] Triffin but his last name was Triffin he
[08:14] presented it to the US and Congress in
[08:16] like the 60s or 70s
[08:19] um must have been the 70s because it
[08:21] must have been post Nixon um and it's
[08:24] basically ally saying that the issuer of
[08:27] the world reserve currency, right? So if
[08:30] we issue the dollar and the dollar is
[08:33] like the currency, right? It's used to
[08:35] settle trade. It's used to store value
[08:38] and or treasury bonds are. It is kind of
[08:41] the primary main currency that so many
[08:45] things are linked to. Um the only person
[08:49] the only entity that can produce the
[08:51] dollar is the US, right? So 100% of the
[08:56] globes, every other countries demand for
[09:00] dollars must be supplied by the US
[09:03] because no one else can make them,
[09:05] right? It's it's pretty simple. So
[09:06] however much dollars Japan wants, China
[09:09] wants, India wants, Europe wants,
[09:11] everyone wants, we have to produce.
[09:15] Well, how do we produce them? We print
[09:17] them. Uh we deficit spend them into
[09:20] existence. And so we must
[09:23] continually issue debt and issue
[09:27] currency to meet the demand of the
[09:29] globe. And so this imply this mandates
[09:33] that we run continual deficits. We're
[09:36] running continual deficits. We are going
[09:38] more and more and more and more into
[09:40] debt. And we're also running trade
[09:42] deficits. People talk about how the US
[09:44] is a twin deficit nation. So we're we're
[09:47] running monetary deficits. We're running
[09:50] trade deficits. So what Triffin's
[09:52] dilemma is is it's saying this dynamic
[09:55] being this twin deficit nation has a
[09:58] cost. It has a price
[10:00] that we really can't escape as long as
[10:04] we shoulder the mantle of meeting this
[10:09] global demand for dollars, US dollar
[10:12] assets, US debt.
[10:14] And the cost that we pay is many things.
[10:19] But
[10:20] um you can think of it most of all that
[10:23] like the brunt of that um those
[10:27] deficits, right? It's born
[10:31] by not top tier financeers who can
[10:35] extract rents from global bond flows or
[10:39] who own assets that global capital
[10:43] surpluses get redirected in. Right? So
[10:46] what happens is like the dollars go out,
[10:48] the debt goes out and then a lot of that
[10:50] comes back to buy tech stocks and a lot
[10:52] of that comes back to buy US dollar
[10:54] denominated assets. So if you either are
[10:57] in the financial industry where you
[11:00] extract basis points from global bond
[11:03] trades and debt issuance and these
[11:05] various things or you're in the tech
[11:08] industry and you get venture investing,
[11:11] those dollars just come to you to invest
[11:13] in your companies because they're the
[11:14] best performing companies in the world.
[11:16] Uh if you're in one of those two
[11:17] industries, you've done great. Like I've
[11:20] always said there there's there's two
[11:21] there's there's tech and finance and
[11:23] there's everything else in America. And
[11:25] if you don't work in tech and
[11:26] finance, you know, you're you're kind of
[11:28] in there's only really a service sector
[11:31] economy. And this is what I think people
[11:33] don't fully understand is in America, I
[11:36] think especially outside of
[11:37] America, it's just a vast service sector
[11:41] economy, retail, fast food, so many
[11:44] contractors, home repair, consumption,
[11:47] goods, yacht. I mean, you know, I'm
[11:49] being that's being uh obviously, you
[11:51] know, car sales, boat sales, mach like,
[11:55] you know, recreational things. It's this
[11:57] vast service sector economy and those
[12:00] jobs aren't very good. You know, they're
[12:02] they're really not. Um, and so with
[12:06] Triffin's dilemma, you either position
[12:09] yourself to
[12:11] extract wealth from this dynamic, which
[12:14] tech and finance are positioned in that
[12:16] way, or you effectively you you
[12:20] subsidize
[12:22] our satisfying of global demand. So the
[12:25] US is satisfying global demand for
[12:28] dollar and dollar assets and the price
[12:31] of that is being paid by America's own
[12:34] middle class and citizens. And so there
[12:37] comes a certain point where people start
[12:39] asking
[12:40] like why are we
[12:42] sacrificing our kind of core middle
[12:46] base? Why are we making our
[12:49] citizens bear all the burdens of this
[12:52] system to
[12:54] satisfy the globe's demand for this
[12:59] currency and asset? And like that's
[13:01] what's being navigated in America right
[13:03] now that's driving a lot of this. And
[13:05] that doesn't mean that the policies are
[13:08] perfect. I actually think the tariffs
[13:10] were way overcalibrated. I think if they
[13:12] stay the way they are, it'll be really
[13:14] bad. Um, now there's a whole other
[13:17] conversation of like, were they ever
[13:19] intended to stay that way? Yes, they've
[13:21] said that. No, that might not be true.
[13:24] But it's not saying that the approach
[13:26] has been perhaps the approach I would
[13:29] take, but this is the the question. How
[13:32] is actually a reaction from um American
[13:35] citizens and your friends from your
[13:38] environment to to those tariffs? I I
[13:40] heard uh for the first time in this
[13:42] administration uh bigger critical things
[13:45] about uh what Trump is doing. I think uh
[13:48] Il Musk was vocal about that he's
[13:50] actually kind of a proponent for zero
[13:52] tariffs. Uh there was some
[13:56] uh
[13:57] Bill
[14:00] Aman is it Bill Aman? I'm not sure. I
[14:03] think he was also vocal about it. Uh so
[14:05] so how do you see the the how is the
[14:08] reaction from from from America and and
[14:11] what what you're seeing uh to to those
[14:13] tariffs and what's going on? Yeah. Yeah.
[14:16] Let me answer that question and then I
[14:17] actually I want to circle back on one
[14:19] other point on the last thing about why
[14:21] this has to do with manufacturing
[14:23] capacity and industrial capacity. I I
[14:25] want to come back to that. But so people
[14:28] that own assets in America right now
[14:32] have been pretty unhappy, right? like
[14:34] there you the Trump administration
[14:39] has I think really pissed off the
[14:42] business class asset owners Elon Musk is
[14:45] unhappy because fundamentally he's an
[14:47] entrepreneur uh and he understands that
[14:49] these policies will be pretty kind of
[14:52] devastating in their current form
[14:55] um and so you know people that own
[14:58] assets are not having a good time and
[15:00] you know I mean I you know not that I'm
[15:03] some like uh you know, you know, uber
[15:06] wealthy billionaire or anything, but
[15:08] even you know, even my own life, like
[15:10] it's you know, it's been a hit and uh it
[15:13] has a kind of
[15:15] gut there's a kind of like a gut punch
[15:17] like it's harder to handle when you're
[15:20] personally kind of bearing the costs
[15:22] every day. Uh, and so it's been
[15:24] difficult, I think, for um just anybody
[15:28] that has a material amount of their net
[15:30] worth stored in financial assets, which
[15:33] is pretty much anybody with any
[15:34] financial assets in the US. However, the
[15:38] thing to understand, so many Americans
[15:41] do not own any assets and they do not
[15:44] care, you know. So there is this
[15:46] remarkable dynamic where there's so so
[15:50] many Americans, many of them Trump
[15:52] voters, who just do not have money in
[15:55] the stock market. They do not have
[15:57] assets. And so frankly, they don't
[16:00] really care if the market goes down. Now
[16:05] this is misguided
[16:07] because in such a financialized economy
[16:10] such as the US, you can't have that sort
[16:13] like the whole system comes off the
[16:15] wheels if if you have a prolonged stock
[16:18] market crash. So there's a very real way
[16:21] that uh you can't you really can't have
[16:23] it. It'll be disastrous. Um but the
[16:26] people that don't own assets don't
[16:28] understand that. And I think there's
[16:30] resentment. And I think there's this
[16:33] kind of view that's like, you know, um,
[16:36] we wanted the system to change. We
[16:38] wanted the system to change. I don't
[16:39] care if the market crashes. You know, I
[16:42] don't have, you know, they're saying
[16:44] that they don't have assets. They don't
[16:45] have opportunities. They've been locked
[16:47] out of upper so upward social mobility
[16:50] for decades. And like this is what they
[16:52] wanted. Um, and so, you know, I I think
[16:56] so many of the people talking about
[16:58] like, oh, there's they're they're, you
[17:00] know, the the Trump faction is uh
[17:02] politically screwed because this will be
[17:04] so unpopular. They're really
[17:08] betraying their own class status and
[17:10] their own financial status as like an
[17:12] asset owner, as somebody that probably
[17:14] has, you know, six, seven plus figures
[17:17] in financial assets whose life is really
[17:20] being impacted by this and they're
[17:22] assuming that everyone else is like
[17:23] them. The thing is is they're not. Uh,
[17:26] you know, very few Americans have large
[17:28] allocations to stocks outside the top
[17:30] 10% of earners. But the confounding
[17:33] thing there is that the the spending
[17:35] patterns and the tax payments of the top
[17:39] 10% of earners are incredibly critical
[17:42] to the US functioning. So I think you
[17:46] know people in that top 10% are very
[17:48] unhappy in America right now with all
[17:50] that's happened. Most people don't care.
[17:54] And I I'd actually really be curious
[17:55] like you're in Europe. Uh I I'm
[17:58] obviously in America. I would like how
[18:00] is this being received like you know the
[18:04] median person there what do other people
[18:07] like what's the average opinion and then
[18:09] is there anybody outside of that average
[18:11] opinion you've come across
[18:14] there is obviously what the mainstream
[18:17] media is saying and what what the
[18:19] officials are saying and then there is
[18:20] what what uh people on the street say
[18:23] and I think uh my environment my
[18:27] subjective small environment
[18:29] really doesn't care right now. Uh but
[18:32] they're saying like, oh, like he he's
[18:34] having a trade war. Like there there are
[18:37] people um that like Trump and there are
[18:39] people that don't like Trump. The people
[18:41] that don't like Trump really don't care
[18:43] about the terrorists right now. And the
[18:45] people that uh don't like him. Uh they
[18:49] are more like, oh, like he's driving
[18:51] down the economy, which is is a weird
[18:53] thing to say. like how can the uh US
[18:57] president drive down the European
[18:59] economy? Yes, there's some influence and
[19:02] some connections there.
[19:04] uh if if he makes tariffs um and this is
[19:07] hurting the European uh economy then the
[19:10] European economy is not strong enough in
[19:12] my opinion uh to because if if he puts
[19:16] too many restrictions on America and and
[19:18] the trade zone uh and European economy
[19:21] would be strong enough then it would
[19:23] hurt America more than it would hurt
[19:25] Europe that's just like my layman's
[19:28] terms understanding of it then uh which
[19:31] is in then is super interesting what the
[19:35] kind of media and and the officials are
[19:37] saying. They are trying to not overdo
[19:40] it. So they are not trying to because I
[19:43] think China really went in there and and
[19:45] really said like the hammer like hey
[19:47] let's let's push back. Europe is a
[19:49] little bit more subtle and tries to uh
[19:53] keep keep an open ear and uh an open
[19:56] dialogue and just make small changes uh
[20:00] which I think um come in in effect uh
[20:03] tomorrow which will be already like one
[20:05] two weeks uh when this podcast will come
[20:07] out. So it will be really fun uh to see
[20:10] how it it shakes up. I personally am uh
[20:14] not not not that interested right now uh
[20:17] with with tariffs. I mean, I don't have
[20:19] a company that that says something like,
[20:22] for example, I heard Apple is really in
[20:26] in a in a in a really bad spot because
[20:29] they are manufacturing a lot in China
[20:32] and yeah, it's it's easy to say, yeah,
[20:35] like then just make the factories in
[20:37] America, but that's a process. Yeah.
[20:40] Yeah, it's a process. Um, so actually
[20:42] that's a great So, thank you for that.
[20:44] Uh, let me respond to that. That's a
[20:45] great jumping off point for the
[20:47] manufacturing point which I did want to
[20:48] touch on.
[20:50] So that's in I I'm very interested like
[20:53] I've been having a kind of back and
[20:55] forth uh with my friend who is uh grew
[21:00] up in South Africa missionaries from
[21:02] Europe Europe has lived in China for
[21:05] many years and he's saying like oh
[21:07] people are so uh unhappy about this but
[21:10] I also felt like he's exposed to a very
[21:14] specific type of person who is European
[21:17] traveling to China doing stuff like it's
[21:21] just it's I would have bet that it's
[21:24] like the average person is more like
[21:27] they don't really know what to make of
[21:29] this. They're not really like super
[21:31] super strong opinion. Uh obviously
[21:33] there's people that hate everything
[21:34] Trump do does and they're going to just
[21:36] hate Trump, you know, whatever it is.
[21:38] And there's people that like Trump,
[21:39] they're going to like whatever it is.
[21:40] But um you know it's it's it's
[21:43] interesting and I liked your point of uh
[21:47] you know I think that your your point
[21:48] about like the strength of these
[21:49] economies uh was interesting to me
[21:52] because like that is part of the the
[21:55] leverage here is as a deficit nation
[21:59] that inherently means we are buying more
[22:02] stuff from you than you are buying from
[22:04] us. That's like what a deficit is.
[22:07] Therefore, America on paper has more
[22:10] leverage in this situation because we're
[22:13] a bigger customer of yours. Uh now, that
[22:16] doesn't mean there aren't many many
[22:17] other factors. How many Treasury bonds
[22:20] you guys all that you could sell on us,
[22:22] if you can make deals with China, if you
[22:24] can, you know, do these sort of things.
[22:26] And I also agree with you, the U. the
[22:28] the EU has really been relatively
[22:30] measured on this. They've done some
[22:32] small things and you know they need to
[22:34] save face and that's going to be natural
[22:36] and all. Trump needs to save face. EU
[22:38] needs to everyone needs to save face. No
[22:40] one wants to go back to their voters and
[22:43] be like, "Yeah, we got our ass kicked.
[22:46] You know, we gave them uh you know, we
[22:49] gave them a bunch of our valuable
[22:50] assets. We got nothing in return." Like
[22:52] it's a terrible look, right? So this
[22:54] will be something everyone's navigating.
[22:56] Um but yeah, China has been very strong.
[23:00] like they they have to fight. They're
[23:01] prepared to fight. Uh the question is
[23:04] like there's there's a strong argument
[23:06] you could make. They don't have a strong
[23:08] hand here. They're in an economic
[23:10] slowdown already. They have demographic
[23:12] issues. They were already kind of
[23:14] bailing out their markets. They've had
[23:16] to put that into overdrive. So like
[23:18] we'll put a pin in that. Um but I think
[23:22] what you see is I I my bet is still that
[23:25] Japan, Europe, South Korea, these
[23:28] countries come together with the US,
[23:31] negotiate a new sort of trade
[23:33] arrangement, become a team again uh and
[23:37] then that that collective front can
[23:39] negotiate with China. I do think the US
[23:42] needs we need Europe and we need Japan
[23:45] to kind of come together and then as a
[23:47] group we can go to China. Um, and you
[23:51] know what's uh I'm kind of going on a
[23:53] tangent here, but what is unfortunate
[23:56] about this situation is in my opinion
[24:00] this trade
[24:02] reordering is deeply necessary. It it is
[24:05] it's been inevitable. It's been a long
[24:07] time coming. It needs to happen. I think
[24:10] there are ways to do it that are very
[24:13] reasonable for everybody that that
[24:15] benefit you know not just America but
[24:17] its partners and um unfortunately the
[24:20] like rhetoric from the Lutnik camp and
[24:23] on these
[24:24] tariffs has been just like very contra
[24:27] uh confrontational and so it's it's set
[24:31] the stage a little weird. Um Scott Bent
[24:34] is now the leading negotiator. I was
[24:37] very public on Twitter. The moment you
[24:39] see Lutnik swapped out for Bessant,
[24:42] that's a pivot for the administration.
[24:44] Bessant's going to negotiate and work
[24:47] something out. Lucknik was pissing
[24:49] everybody off. So, we're through that
[24:51] already and I'm hoping they can kind of
[24:53] rein it in. Anyways, that's a bunch of
[24:55] stuff um on what you said.
[24:58] But a point that so one of the real so
[25:03] you've seen a lot of conversation about
[25:05] industrialization in the US and Trump
[25:08] has been very vocal that he wants to
[25:10] bring industry back. He wants to bring
[25:12] manufacturing back. And there's been a
[25:14] lot of people kind of making fun of that
[25:16] and like these jokes about, you know,
[25:19] like Americans don't want to sew socks
[25:22] in a factory. Like what? You're going to
[25:23] take uh, you know, you do PowerPoint for
[25:26] a job now? Great. Now you're going to
[25:27] screw in screws on an iPhone. And
[25:29] everyone's like, why would we want that?
[25:31] We don't want these factories. These
[25:32] jobs are not great.
[25:36] Um, and I mean, this is a this is a
[25:39] straw man. I mean, this is just a
[25:42] complete
[25:43] um bad faith engagement with the topic.
[25:47] Uh and I'm not saying that the
[25:49] administration, particularly Lutnik, has
[25:51] been super clear about this, but one of
[25:53] the Triffin's dilemma dynamics, one of
[25:56] the challenges that America has faced is
[25:59] because the dollar is the strongest,
[26:03] it's going to be the strongest currency
[26:04] in the world. It's in the most demand.
[26:06] More people want dollars than any other
[26:08] currency.
[26:09] that effectively makes the dollar worth
[26:12] more than other currencies, right? Like
[26:15] in a in a certain sense.
[26:17] Um, which means manufacturing in the US
[26:22] will structurally be more expensive due
[26:25] to currency exchange rates. Like not
[26:28] even taking into account quality of
[26:30] living and wages and all these things
[26:32] because other countries have to
[26:34] basically take their weaker currency and
[26:37] buy goods that are priced in our
[26:39] stronger currency. manufacturing is
[26:42] basically nonviable in the US and that's
[26:45] been bad for like you know middle class
[26:47] jobs and stable families birth rate all
[26:50] these things and that's one factor they
[26:53] want to address that they know that
[26:54] these are having these jobs strengthens
[26:57] the middle class but the other factor I
[27:00] think is much more material and it's a
[27:03] lesson that the Americans learned during
[27:06] co we had to rely on China for
[27:10] life-saving pharmaceutical medications.
[27:13] And if they wouldn't have shipped those
[27:14] to us, Americans would have died it in
[27:17] mass. Uh we also had to rely on them for
[27:21] technology. We rely on uh Taiwan for
[27:24] semiconductors. If if China takes
[27:26] Taiwan, I mean, we're screwed. We're
[27:28] we're so screwed, right? We don't build
[27:30] ships anymore. We don't build, you know,
[27:33] we build very little. And so there is a
[27:36] profoundly necessary
[27:39] strategic national security element to
[27:42] this where we need manufacturing here in
[27:47] case things ever go bad.
[27:49] Otherwise, we're basically just
[27:51] completely surrendering our sovereignty
[27:55] to manufacturing nations who may turn
[27:57] hostile. Um, and so that is like the
[27:59] other element of Triffin's dilemma and
[28:02] something that's being navigated here.
[28:05] And you can look at this in Stephen
[28:07] Moran's comments. Um, and you can see
[28:10] that one of the ways that countries are
[28:12] going to get these tariffs rolled back
[28:15] is they have the option to invest in
[28:17] industrial capacity in the US. So, it's
[28:20] basically saying, "Hey, Taiwan, we'll
[28:22] drop these tariffs against you
[28:25] and we will send our uh we'll provide
[28:28] you with security guarantees. We have
[28:30] the best military in the world. We'll
[28:32] defend you. Uh we'll um drop the
[28:36] tariffs. We'll even do more trade with
[28:38] you. But what you need to do is you need
[28:40] to take a hundred billion dollars a year
[28:43] and you need to build Taiwan
[28:45] semiconductor factories in the US. And
[28:48] those need to be here. You can own them.
[28:50] You can operate them. You can derive
[28:52] profits from them. But you're going to
[28:54] hire American workers that'll be trained
[28:56] to do these jobs. And those factories
[28:59] will physically be located in the US so
[29:01] that in a worst case scenario like a
[29:03] war, we have access to that capacity and
[29:06] a skilled workforce that can operate it.
[29:10] So this is and I think you see a lot of
[29:14] that if countries want to invest
[29:15] industrial capacity here the tariffs get
[29:18] dropped and that would be a win if that
[29:20] ends up happening I would consider that
[29:21] a win but so that's just kind of one
[29:23] other element that I think is essential
[29:25] to understanding this that is super
[29:28] interesting uh to hear that perspective
[29:30] and also I think one aspect um because
[29:34] you mentioned it already like the asset
[29:35] owners uh are now kind of saying, "Oh,
[29:39] it it's bad." I don't I have actually
[29:42] not looked at uh the the American stock
[29:45] market that much because I just don't
[29:47] have any stocks. I just have Bitcoin.
[29:49] But I've seen uh I just looked it up
[29:51] with some European stocks. And yeah,
[29:54] it's going down like 9 10
[29:57] 11%. But at the same time, it's right
[29:59] around that level where it was in the
[30:01] beginning of the year, which is was not
[30:03] that it's it's it's like it's not that
[30:06] bad, I think. I think people amplify it
[30:10] uh a lot. I I don't know how the S&P 500
[30:13] actually looks. I I didn't even uh look.
[30:16] Let's uh quickly look into that because
[30:19] um it is let's see it's 10% down for the
[30:23] month uh and 13 uh% down for a year to
[30:27] date uh and like around zero for one
[30:31] year. Uh yeah. So it it it's obviously
[30:34] not good. like it it lost uh around uh
[30:38] 20% in the last like one and a half two
[30:42] months but it's not that bad like if you
[30:45] invest in something I always feel like
[30:47] you you should invest in something long
[30:49] term uh and uh because I only have
[30:52] Bitcoin I'm I'm I'm very used to the the
[30:55] volatility anyways and and and this
[30:57] feels like nothing like
[31:00] that nothing really happened
[31:03] so I think that's correct effect in some
[31:05] ways like assets are still up
[31:08] tremendously over five year three year
[31:11] twoear time horizon right so asset
[31:14] owners have done very well and really
[31:16] it's not so bad but I think the push
[31:19] back this is the fastest 3-day drop in
[31:23] the S&P of all time period it is it is
[31:26] the speed at which it has almost all of
[31:30] that drop has been in the last week and
[31:32] so that is what has I think really
[31:36] spooked people and then what has
[31:38] happened yesterday and this is important
[31:40] for people to watch and it's important
[31:42] for Bitcoiners. We've talked a lot about
[31:44] kind of these uh macroeconomic issues
[31:46] and they and they play in fundamentally
[31:47] to Bitcoin. uh you know we can maybe
[31:49] discuss the tie-in a little bit but um
[31:52] the kind of so basically there's a ton
[31:54] of dynamics between different US
[31:58] treasury instruments the yield right
[32:01] you've heard of yield curve you've heard
[32:03] of like these things so there are
[32:05] basically ratios which can
[32:09] signal real dysfunction in the
[32:12] fundamental monetary system the treasury
[32:15] market and financial plumbing these are
[32:18] the sort of ISS issues that get the
[32:19] Federal Reserve to come in. These are
[32:20] the sort of issues that get the Fed to
[32:23] QE, money printing, stabilization,
[32:26] right? And so starting like the last 48
[32:30] hours post the China escalation, so this
[32:33] is both Trump's escalation on China and
[32:37] China's retaliation back. um these like
[32:42] the the the swaps and the interest rate
[32:44] differentials between you know the
[32:46] short-term US treasuries and the
[32:48] long-term US Treasury has just like
[32:50] completely blown out. And if this
[32:52] continues in any capacity, you're in a
[32:55] situation where like the Fed has to step
[32:57] in on the weekend. Now, it may not
[33:00] continue. Maybe it'll stabilize, maybe
[33:02] it won't. We'll find out. But we're
[33:04] getting in that zone where I think it's
[33:07] somewhat realistic to expect what has
[33:09] been um what's been notable is the Fed
[33:13] has been very concerned even unconcerned
[33:16] even though we've seen basically a stock
[33:19] market fall that is only rivaled by 2008
[33:22] and um the COVID crash and yet they've
[33:26] been unwilling to do much which is
[33:28] interesting in of itself and people have
[33:30] theories on that.
[33:32] Um, but now we're we're getting in a
[33:35] zone where things are starting to break.
[33:37] If this continues, things start to break
[33:39] and they need to step in. And so this is
[33:41] obviously something any investor should
[33:44] be watching, but also Bitcoin investors,
[33:46] right? Like if you when you hit that
[33:48] point that both the Fed and uh the Trump
[33:54] administration are kind of trying to
[33:57] stabilize things historically. I mean,
[34:00] that's your buying opportunity or that's
[34:02] your turnaround point. Uh, and my honest
[34:04] take is we're getting close to that.
[34:06] There's like a ton of fear. Um, people
[34:09] are, you know, really panicked in
[34:11] markets and, uh, but I I I really have
[34:14] to think we're very close to the end and
[34:18] you start to see some um, resolution
[34:20] here. I would be surprised if we don't
[34:23] see a deal with Japan at the very least
[34:25] within the next week. Let's take a break
[34:27] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[34:30] that coin vigilante has made with the
[34:33] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[34:35] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[34:38] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[34:41] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[34:44] completely new and amazing Genesis
[34:46] edition of their watch collections. You
[34:50] have the date of the first ever mined
[34:53] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[34:55] also the block height and which epoch we
[34:58] are currently in. I love the level of
[35:01] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[35:04] Make sure to check out those amazing
[35:06] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[35:09] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[35:12] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[35:15] really do hope that you don't have it on
[35:17] exchange. But if you do have it on
[35:19] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[35:21] deal with that. The first way is you put
[35:23] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[35:25] entry for you to get into the
[35:28] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[35:31] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[35:34] super simple and secure way. And if you
[35:36] check out the link in the description,
[35:38] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[35:41] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[35:44] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[35:47] partner in terms of how to get the most
[35:50] out of your sovereignty. They will
[35:53] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[35:56] that is perfect for your individual
[35:59] situation. They will show you how you
[36:01] can secure your own devices. Securing
[36:04] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[36:06] have to keep all your devices secure.
[36:08] One topic that is overlooked often is
[36:11] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[36:13] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[36:16] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[36:19] place already? And last but not least,
[36:21] if you're in the jurisdictions where you
[36:23] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[36:25] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[36:30] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:33] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:36] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:39] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:41] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:44] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:46] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:48] the link down in the description of
[36:51] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[36:53] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[36:57] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[36:58] there. Interesting. I It's It's super
[37:01] interesting this whole thing. It's also
[37:03] when when we have Bitcoin. I think maybe
[37:07] that's why I'm I'm
[37:08] more relaxed around that. Sure. Uh
[37:12] because it's like yeah longterm uh money
[37:16] printer will print more money. Uh if the
[37:18] stock market continues to go down at
[37:20] some point the Fed will step in and say
[37:22] like hey like we have to do something we
[37:23] have to buy thing like the same way as
[37:25] they did in the in the co crash. It was
[37:28] fascinating to watch. Uh we had a huge
[37:31] huge dip and they just printed I think
[37:34] what was it 40% of the whole money
[37:36] supply within one year. uh and we had uh
[37:40] 40 or 45% uptick from the S&P 500 from
[37:43] the starting of the year to the end of
[37:45] the year and then the KOIC crash was
[37:47] inside there. So uh for for from someone
[37:51] that just holds Bitcoin for the long run
[37:53] and isn't intending at all to sell
[37:56] anytime soon anything because I'm
[37:58] operating on a on a Bitcoin standard.
[38:01] I'm like, yeah, let's see how it goes. I
[38:03] I'm just hoping that a trade war is not
[38:06] actually coming to an actual war. That
[38:08] that that's my only small concern. Is it
[38:11] also something that that you're looking
[38:12] at it or is it just something that Yeah,
[38:15] they they're not trying to to poke each
[38:18] other and and and seeing where where
[38:20] they land end up, but they will make
[38:23] deals in the in in this year 2025, maybe
[38:26] 2026.
[38:28] Yeah. So yeah, I'm very low
[38:31] probabilities this results in like
[38:33] actual war. I'm not I I think people get
[38:37] really panicked when these I'm not
[38:38] saying you are, but like I think you
[38:39] know that gets floated around and people
[38:41] get really panicked during these things
[38:43] and you know something they don't
[38:46] understand is
[38:47] like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
[38:51] will sue each other in court on Monday
[38:53] and then work a deal together on
[38:55] Tuesday. People need to understand that
[38:58] in these levels like it's not like um
[39:02] individuals where everyone's like
[39:04] personally slighted. There's obviously
[39:05] some human elements there and people can
[39:07] be kind of irrational and emotional but
[39:10] like this is what happens between giant
[39:13] superpowers. I mean China spies on us
[39:16] and steals technology like we you know
[39:19] make you know do aggressive economic
[39:21] moves back to them. like this this just
[39:24] happens, you know, and Russia's been in
[39:26] a hot war with Ukraine and yet, you
[39:28] know, we're still trying to
[39:30] negoty energy from them. You know,
[39:32] India's buying energy from them and now
[39:34] we're trying to negotiate an end to
[39:36] this. Like it you just have to have a
[39:38] little bit of a different view on giant
[39:40] sovereign superpowers that like tension
[39:42] and competition is the name of the game.
[39:44] If you can find an opportunity to
[39:47] improve your standing and the citizens
[39:50] of your nation, their quality of life,
[39:52] you do it. Um, so I think people are a
[39:54] little they're a little too afraid here.
[39:56] I think the reason they're afraid is
[39:57] like maybe a lot too afraid. It's just
[39:59] that this is unprecedented. This is a
[40:01] total change in the postw World War II
[40:04] uh monetary and uh political order. It's
[40:07] a big thing. A lot of people don't trust
[40:09] Trump to navigate that uh effectively.
[40:13] uh they think he's unreliable.
[40:16] Um you could take another stance
[40:20] um that it's actually one of his biggest
[40:23] assets in this is his perceived
[40:26] erraticness. Uh and so you get into this
[40:29] really interesting question of is he
[40:32] actually this erratic or does he play it
[40:36] up in order to get leverage? Uh, and we
[40:40] have quotes from him talking about doing
[40:42] just that. There are numerous quotes
[40:44] from Trump uh, from both the previous
[40:46] administration, books, interviews where
[40:48] he's like, "Yeah, I want people to think
[40:50] I'm crazy. That's how he likes
[40:53] to negotiate." Um, but then but then you
[40:56] have this other question that's like,
[40:58] "Okay, so
[40:59] maybe X percentage of it is effectively
[41:03] a show. It's effectively uh putting
[41:05] something on, but what's the remaining
[41:07] y%?" you know, but how how crazy are you
[41:10] actually, right? And maybe that's a
[41:12] small number, maybe that's a big number.
[41:14] It's hard to you can't really know. Um,
[41:17] so it's something, you know, it's it's I
[41:19] I had a I had I had a post uh this
[41:23] morning that we're in like the we're in
[41:26] like the Sila and we're we're like
[41:28] sailing between the Sila and Kuribdus of
[41:30] retardation where to our left is like
[41:34] anti-Trump retardation, to our right is
[41:37] proTrump retardation. And it is getting
[41:39] narrower and narrower to pass through
[41:41] this gap where you're not being pulled
[41:44] into like
[41:45] reflexively, you know, either like just
[41:47] thinking one way or the other. uh you
[41:50] know these are very um what's going on
[41:54] triggers a lot of responses from people
[41:56] and it's very challenging in this moment
[41:59] to try to I think have a very sober and
[42:02] clear view of what's happening
[42:05] especially because we don't have we're
[42:08] working with very incomplete information
[42:11] um but coming back it's I think a lot of
[42:15] it's overblown I think we start getting
[42:17] deals within the next seven days Japan
[42:19] hand first, then something gets worked
[42:21] out with the EU. Um, and and I think
[42:24] this thing starts to get resolved. I
[42:26] think it was this big rupture and I
[42:29] think it was um I don't think you had to
[42:32] do it exactly like this. I think
[42:34] mistakes were made, but I do think some
[42:36] sort of rupture and restructuring was
[42:38] necessary. And I, you know, I think we
[42:40] get to a point where this gets
[42:43] navigated. Now you know coming to
[42:45] Bitcoin um this is really good for
[42:49] Bitcoin in many ways like you know you
[42:53] could go down a theory where
[42:56] actually one might
[42:59] expect them to actually like really play
[43:02] into Bitcoin in this kind of
[43:04] restructuring like the monetary order is
[43:08] being renegotiated whether that gets
[43:10] done successfully or unsuccessfully
[43:12] we're going to find out, but it is being
[43:16] renegotiated. And you have an
[43:18] administration that has been very
[43:20] amenable to Bitcoin and that by virtue
[43:24] of being concerned about the topics they
[43:27] are concerned about, um, they
[43:31] inherently
[43:33] value a neutral reserve asset. like a
[43:36] neutral reserve asset is a large part of
[43:40] the solution to these problems that
[43:43] they're navigating. Trade deals and like
[43:46] investment and re-industri like these
[43:48] are other solutions. They need those
[43:49] too. But playing into
[43:53] um Bitcoin uh which has gotten a lot
[43:57] more airtime than gold which would be
[43:59] your other option um would make sense
[44:02] here. And I'm somebody like, let me be
[44:04] really clear in the Bitcoin space.
[44:06] There's a lot of people that have always
[44:08] been like, you know, like you're gonna
[44:10] wake up one day and hyper
[44:11] Bitcoinization's going to happen. You're
[44:13] going to wake up and there's going to be
[44:14] like this sudden change. I've always
[44:15] been like pretty skeptical of that. I I
[44:17] I thought we're really nowhere near
[44:19] there. The world is not ready for that.
[44:21] Uh it's just not going to happen.
[44:24] But for the first time ever, I think you
[44:26] do actually have a real probability
[44:31] where you could see major geopolitical
[44:35] moves that again, not that the dollar
[44:38] disappears or the US treasuries go away,
[44:41] but you could see Bitcoin or gold or
[44:45] Bitcoin and gold um start to play like a
[44:49] real role in the monetary order and
[44:52] there would be incentives for the
[44:54] administration to do something along
[44:56] those lines. So you a have this really
[45:01] interesting opportunity because of
[45:03] that. B global tension, trade breakdown,
[45:09] asset
[45:10] insecurity also is quite bullish for
[45:13] Bitcoin. Further, China's response to
[45:16] this whole thing has been devaluing
[45:18] their currency. the last time they
[45:20] devalued their currency, a ton of money
[45:22] flowed into Bitcoin out of China.
[45:24] So once we're through the initial shocks
[45:28] of this process, there's some things
[45:30] that I think are very very good for
[45:33] Bitcoin. Um just from the
[45:36] basic events. Uh and then you have this
[45:40] kind of call option upside you have this
[45:42] also this chance
[45:44] that I mean I'm I'm bullish. I I would
[45:47] say the odds that the Trump
[45:49] administration buys additional Bitcoin
[45:51] in this next year are very very high. I
[45:53] think they do that and they may use this
[45:55] to leverage as a piece of the new
[45:58] monetary order. Um so it's it's a lot to
[46:02] pay attention to right for for Bitcoin.
[46:04] In in my research, I I I came across one
[46:06] podcast you did and I think you you
[46:08] called uh it was like last year Danzo
[46:10] around a year ago and you called 204 one
[46:13] of the most significant years in in
[46:15] Bitcoin yet. How do you look at 2025 for
[46:19] for Bitcoin? I mean there's actually a
[46:21] lot happening in 204. So you turned out
[46:24] to be very true on that manner. But what
[46:27] you what are you expecting for this
[46:28] year? I think this is going to be a
[46:30] historic year for Bitcoin. Um, and I
[46:34] think um, you need to look past the the
[46:37] price movements recently. It's literally
[46:40] the only thing that has been going on
[46:42] with Bitcoin price is as a reaction to
[46:46] global asset panic, right? It has
[46:49] nothing to do with Bitcoin. In
[46:51] fact, if you told me two years ago that
[46:55] the S&P would be down
[46:57] 20% in like two weeks and asked me how
[47:01] much Bitcoin would be down, I would have
[47:03] said 50%
[47:05] plus. And it's down,
[47:07] sure, but it has been tame compared to
[47:12] the S&P. And I I think like peak to
[47:16] low something like 30%
[47:19] 35%. But again, it didn't trade at that
[47:22] peak for very long. That peak was like a
[47:24] moment. I I think at the average sort of
[47:26] price and this was at the end of a big
[47:29] runup and all these catalysts like I'm
[47:32] saying the high price is a little
[47:34] inaccurate. It's a little weighted to
[47:35] the high side because of just that was
[47:37] the top of a big multi-month movement
[47:40] with a lot of enthusiasm. You know, I
[47:42] would I would kind of clock the high as
[47:45] like, you know, 100K, 103K, something
[47:48] like that. It's just mildly off. And
[47:50] then, you know, basically the low has
[47:52] been, you know, upper 70s. We got a
[47:54] little bit lower, but
[47:57] um you know,
[47:59] 25%. The S&P is down
[48:02] 20%. It's that's never happened in the
[48:04] history. One should be very enthusiastic
[48:07] that even
[48:09] in true
[48:11] panic, Bitcoin is really holding its
[48:14] own. It is no longer trading at a huge
[48:17] kind of leveraged multiple to financial
[48:20] assets. Um, and I think this is because
[48:23] people recognize that in this
[48:25] environment, this is actually a pretty
[48:27] good thing to own. This is actually
[48:29] something that uh makes sense. And so I
[48:32] think this will be a historic year for
[48:34] Bitcoin. Um I I think like I said your
[48:39] probabilities that at some point this
[48:43] year something happens for
[48:46] Bitcoin that I
[48:48] think totally
[48:51] transforms what it is and its role in
[48:55] global markets. I think it's really
[48:57] pretty high. Whether that's the US
[48:59] buying it and actually leveraging it as
[49:02] part of a new monetary framework. Again,
[49:05] even as a small part, like that's not me
[49:06] saying, you know, everything's Bitcoin,
[49:08] but even if it's like a small like a
[49:10] part that's so incredibly material or
[49:14] just as a result of these geopolitical
[49:17] tensions, markets start to
[49:20] value neutral reserve assets that uh
[49:23] have no tariff exposure and are not
[49:26] exposed to debt burdens or growth
[49:28] slowdowns or recessions or these sort of
[49:31] things like that's possible too. as well
[49:34] as other countries like maybe they they
[49:36] want to hold less dollars, they lose a
[49:38] little bit of faith or they they're a
[49:40] little uncomfortable after everything
[49:42] that happened and maybe they hold a
[49:44] little bit more Bitcoin. I think all of
[49:46] these would
[49:47] be I mean gamechanging in a way that
[49:50] would make the ETFs look minor that
[49:53] would make them look like a small thing.
[49:55] And I think your odds of something like
[49:57] that happening 2025 are are really quite
[50:00] high. Um, I think Bitcoin has one of the
[50:04] best outlooks out of any asset uh at
[50:08] this time. And you know, I'm not saying
[50:10] that because I'm a Bitcoiner or I work
[50:12] in the industry. I just I really believe
[50:14] that. I think it's a sober assessment.
[50:16] And I think there are other people that
[50:18] are saying and realizing that too.
[50:21] Is that maybe early signs of uh
[50:24] decoupling from the overall market? So
[50:27] like Bitcoin uh trades on its own versus
[50:31] it's it's not correlated to the S&P 500
[50:34] to tech stocks and the the volatility
[50:36] there. Yeah. So uh in some ways like in
[50:40] essence I agree kind of with what you're
[50:42] saying. I'm going to be a little
[50:43] pedantic here because uh I think it's
[50:45] important how we talk about this and
[50:47] it's more in response to other people
[50:49] talking in this way. So nothing is
[50:53] really decoupled from financial markets
[50:55] like it it's it is all it's always
[50:57] responding to each other right like
[51:00] whether inversely it goes down so it
[51:03] goes up or the other way you know or it
[51:05] goes down so it goes down. Um gold is
[51:08] you know responds to financial markets
[51:10] and there's a million things that go on
[51:12] that will always provoke a reaction.
[51:14] Bitcoin will always respond to big
[51:17] market movements. Um, but the thing
[51:21] that's changing is I think this
[51:25] like high-risk tech stock beta
[51:29] relationship, right? Where it's like
[51:32] Bitcoin kind of just follows the NASDAQ
[51:34] and if stocks are doing really good then
[51:36] it does better and if stocks crash then
[51:38] it falls more. that I think is ending
[51:41] and that's a good thing because it
[51:43] allows a new relationship to form which
[51:46] I think does lay the groundwork for
[51:49] something that I would agree with is
[51:50] kind it's kind of a decoupling like it
[51:52] is it's kind of a very new relationship
[51:55] where Bitcoin could certainly function
[51:58] as a safe haven asset and could be
[52:00] something that investors turn to uh just
[52:03] as part of their portfolio and honestly
[52:05] and and additionally when they're scared
[52:08] or concerned. That's a really good
[52:10] point. I never thought about that
[52:11] because you were totally right. Uh even
[52:14] if uh the S&P 500 would go down 20% and
[52:19] in the same week Bitcoin is going up
[52:21] 20%, everyone would call it a
[52:24] decoupling. But actually it's it's still
[52:27] correlated because like money is flowing
[52:29] and those markets are connected. There
[52:31] are people selling stocks to buy
[52:34] Bitcoin. So there is a a connection
[52:37] there. So, it's more of a I don't know.
[52:41] I don't know a good other word for that,
[52:44] but you're right. Decoupling is kind of
[52:46] a bad word for that because it's it it
[52:49] almost seems like there's like two
[52:50] different markets. And if there's buyers
[52:53] that literally sell their stocks and buy
[52:55] Bitcoin with their money because they
[52:57] trust Bitcoin more and they don't trust
[52:59] stocks anymore, which happens when
[53:00] there's B500 goes down and Bitcoin goes
[53:02] up. there is a coupling going on, but I
[53:06] don't I'm searching a good out of word
[53:08] for that. It's it's just like the
[53:09] correlation uh the the relationship
[53:12] changes between those, I guess. Yeah.
[53:14] And 100%. And and that's exactly my
[53:17] point is like they're always going to be
[53:19] coupled like these things intimately
[53:22] relate to each other. But I think what
[53:24] people are pointing out is the
[53:26] relationship between the two has
[53:29] changed. That's true. And I think that
[53:31] continues to be true in a very positive
[53:34] direction. Uh I would, you know, very
[53:37] much like Bitcoin to have a new
[53:40] relationship with risk assets and tech
[53:43] stocks than the one it's had in the
[53:45] past. And I think that is unfolding
[53:47] before us. 100%. Um, one thing I
[53:50] remember you also said right in the in
[53:51] in the beginning, uh, this K-shaped
[53:54] economy where we we always have
[53:58] inequality. That's natural, but we are
[54:01] amplifying that with fiat and we're
[54:03] amplifying that a lot. How do you see
[54:06] that uh changing uh with Bitcoin? And do
[54:09] you think this only changes if we come
[54:12] to a Bitcoin standard or is that also
[54:15] changing if we still have fiat
[54:16] currencies and just Bitcoin is is a way
[54:19] more dominant asset?
[54:22] So this is one place where I differ
[54:27] from maybe a lot of Bitcoiners is I
[54:30] think uh a
[54:34] the Bitcoin only no fiat currency
[54:39] scenario 50 years away if at all. uh
[54:43] it's a really long way away, but B, I
[54:47] see a tremendous amount of benefits to
[54:50] fiat plus Bitcoin that these systems
[54:54] both exist. And I think even in that
[54:57] scenario, I think
[54:59] Bitcoin protects people from the worst
[55:02] abuses of fiat currency. I don't see a
[55:06] super functional pathway where you're
[55:08] going to rip away from all the
[55:11] governments of the world the ability to
[55:13] issue currency um without very extreme
[55:17] and tectonic shifts happening that uh
[55:20] would make the last few weeks look like
[55:22] a blip. Um but what I do see as very
[55:27] possible and desirable is that Bitcoin
[55:31] can provide uh an anchor point for
[55:35] global trade, global finance and
[55:37] people's wealth that a allows people to
[55:41] save their value in assets that are not
[55:45] tied to these things and
[55:48] b it provides a very transparent
[55:52] current thermometer for fiat abuse.
[55:55] Meaning the more fiat abuse goes on, the
[55:59] more money you print, the more uh
[56:02] suppression that is happening, the more
[56:05] people buy Bitcoin, the faster Bitcoin
[56:07] goes up. And so if it goes up too fast,
[56:09] everyone leaves your currency for it. So
[56:11] you kind of need to behave more
[56:13] honestly, otherwise people exit. Bitcoin
[56:18] gives investors the right to exit. Um
[56:22] and so the the hedgeimon and the
[56:24] currency issuer has to behave better
[56:28] because otherwise people will take their
[56:29] assets and leave. And that is kind of
[56:32] the real benefit I see of Bitcoin in
[56:35] addition to fiat. Um and this is one of
[56:38] the problems you're seeing right now
[56:41] with I would say the Trump
[56:42] administration rhetoric. They're saying
[56:44] all streets what been winning for a long
[56:46] time. It's time for Main Street to win.
[56:50] Um there's elements of that that I'm of
[56:53] course fine with of yeah we need to make
[56:56] it better for middle class Americans uh
[56:59] at the ex you know and too much of the
[57:02] value has been captured by the financial
[57:04] class. The problem is nobody can
[57:07] save nobody can save their money. So if
[57:11] you nuke the stock market you just
[57:13] crushed everyone's savings. There is a
[57:16] savings problem. Uh, and so you can't
[57:19] separate Wall, if Wall Street was just
[57:24] this, think of it like a venture capital
[57:27] fund, right? People invest in a venture
[57:30] capital fund to make excess returns.
[57:33] They're thinking, maybe I can make a lot
[57:35] of money doing this. This is like a a
[57:37] play. I'm gonna I like to invest. I like
[57:39] these companies. I like these VCs. I'm
[57:42] going to give them a hundred grand and
[57:43] maybe they'll turn that into a million
[57:44] dollars. I'm taking risk with my
[57:46] capital.
[57:48] If that's what Wall Street was, meaning
[57:51] it's a
[57:52] discretionary risk-taking environment
[57:55] where you put some of your money in
[57:57] stocks to try to make more money, then
[57:59] you could say what they're saying and
[58:01] you could say, "Hey, we don't really
[58:03] care about those guys so much. We want
[58:05] to focus on the workers." Um, but if the
[58:09] only way that an American
[58:11] worker can save money over the long run
[58:16] is basically stocks. And you know, we
[58:19] know Bitcoin, but like for the average
[58:20] person, it it's stocks. Like stocks are
[58:22] what you do. Your 401k, your sav your
[58:25] IRA,
[58:26] your you can't make these claims. Like
[58:28] you just you can't say this because
[58:30] you're actually crushing like the
[58:33] savings of everybody. You need to first
[58:36] give Americans the option to save their
[58:40] work surplus and their wealth in
[58:43] something that you're not going to
[58:44] target to then wrangle Wall Street. And
[58:47] so I think that's the main issue. Um but
[58:52] that's also what Bitcoin brings to the
[58:54] world is a way to save money that um you
[58:59] know isn't so tied to all of these
[59:02] systems. And I think investors might
[59:06] realize that
[59:07] because everyone has all their money
[59:10] tied up in stocks and equities and
[59:12] they're realizing that these equities
[59:14] are fundamentally exposed
[59:18] to trade tensions, debt issues,
[59:22] tariffs, you know, import export
[59:25] problems. And then you start to think
[59:28] that's a pretty tough place to save all
[59:30] my wealth. That's kind of a risk that
[59:31] I'm taking. And what if there was
[59:33] another asset that I could save some
[59:35] wealth in that wouldn't be so exposed to
[59:39] these sorts of things and that's
[59:41] Bitcoin. Uh and I think it'd be very
[59:43] bullish
[59:45] if investors started to see it that way
[59:48] that actually stocks have a specific set
[59:51] of risks that hasn't been a problem for
[59:54] the last 20 years because of like
[59:57] globalization but maybe is a risk now
[60:00] and we need to recalibrate. That's super
[60:02] interesting. Uh that that view. Do you
[60:06] see I think Larry Leah has has
[60:08] popularized that big print uh
[60:10] terminology. Do you see something like
[60:12] that happening if uh the stock market
[60:15] isn't um recovering? If the main street
[60:19] is kind of focused and the stock market
[60:21] is rec is kind of going bad and bad for
[60:25] a longer period of time and there might
[60:27] not come a deal or something like that.
[60:28] Do you think uh a big print like we had
[60:32] in two 2020 with with COVID or something
[60:35] like that could actually happen again?
[60:38] So I haven't I haven't read the book so
[60:40] not a specific endorsement of any claims
[60:44] uh in there but
[60:47] um yeah I mean I think we are running up
[60:49] to a point where you you you will see
[60:52] monetary interventions and fiscal
[60:54] interventions. I think that's getting
[60:56] unless something radically changes and
[60:58] quickly I I do think the Fed is going to
[61:01] have to start to act. Uh probably I mean
[61:03] if if it continues like it's been going
[61:05] for another week like probably by the
[61:07] weekend um even if it doesn't like I
[61:10] could see it in a couple weeks to a
[61:12] couple months uh things are not in a
[61:15] strong spot. So, some sort of
[61:17] intervention. Absolutely.
[61:19] Yes. A massive COVID level intervention.
[61:23] I don't we're not there yet. I think
[61:25] we're not there yet. Um but I think
[61:27] you're go you're going to see some
[61:29] stuff. And obviously if this took kind
[61:31] of
[61:32] a very unpleasant path you could get
[61:34] there, but um I I think your odds of a
[61:38] Federal Reserve monetary intervention
[61:40] are getting pretty good right now.
[61:42] Interesting. Yeah. Um, one last topic
[61:45] for for today uh is uh a little bit more
[61:48] personal, but how did Bitcoin change you
[61:51] when when Bitcoin came into your life?
[61:53] Did did something actually change you?
[61:54] Because I see two two two types of
[61:57] Bitcoiners, those who actually had uh a
[62:01] lot of those Bitcoin mentalities and
[62:02] Bitcoin mind shifts already before
[62:04] Bitcoin in there. They might have were
[62:06] like a big fan of of gold before or
[62:08] something like that. and those who
[62:11] discovered Bitcoin and something broke
[62:13] in their mind and a lot of other things
[62:15] all of the sudden were questions in in
[62:17] their life. How was how was uh Bitcoin
[62:20] impacting your life?
[62:23] Yeah, so I was in that late that latter
[62:25] camp of uh was not a gold guy or a
[62:28] libertarian before Bitcoin. Um
[62:33] and it made me think about a lot of
[62:35] these questions. It made me think mostly
[62:37] like monetary matters and financial
[62:39] matters uh was not something that I paid
[62:41] much attention to before and uh Bitcoin
[62:44] got me to do that. So, I mean, it did
[62:46] have a big shift on my life and uh my
[62:48] interests. And, you know, it's kind of
[62:50] what I said at the beginning of this
[62:52] interview that uh one of the things
[62:53] that's been so surprising about this
[62:55] last uh couple weeks is seeing these the
[62:59] only people I've ever heard talk about
[63:01] Triffin's dilemma were Bitcoiners and
[63:03] now, you know, they're effectively
[63:06] talking about it as the highest level of
[63:09] uh American policy. So, that's, you
[63:11] know, it's interesting to see. Um, and
[63:14] yeah, I mean it made me take that very
[63:16] seriously and it made me have a real
[63:17] appreciation for how
[63:19] much money impacts life. I think people
[63:23] think about I want more money or the
[63:28] problems that having too little money
[63:30] poses, but they rarely think about the
[63:32] qualities of money or how the system of
[63:36] money functions and what it produces.
[63:38] So, I think Bitcoin got me thinking
[63:40] about that and it's been something I've
[63:43] tremendously enjoyed and um you know has
[63:47] just been a fantastic interest since.
[63:51] Awesome, man. It's I see that uh in a
[63:54] lot of people
[63:56] where if you start questioning something
[63:58] fundamentally like money, you all of the
[64:01] sudden asking a lot more question in in
[64:04] other areas like okay I I was wrong
[64:06] about that thing. What what else what
[64:09] else did I not get? Um I I have one
[64:13] question that I ask each and every one
[64:14] of my guests. Uh and the question is
[64:16] what can we learn from you besides
[64:18] Bitcoin? So I am very well known uh on
[64:21] the internet for uh one to two other
[64:24] things besides Bitcoin. Uh and it is for
[64:28] um walking. I walk 10 to 20 miles a day.
[64:33] So I am like a prolific like really a
[64:36] prolific walker to a very high scale. Uh
[64:39] I'm a very large proponent for that. Uh
[64:42] I think it's can be life-changing and
[64:44] not just on a health level. I think it's
[64:46] it's all-encompassing. you think better,
[64:48] you feel better, everything's better.
[64:50] So, I am a big proponent
[64:53] for really walking as much as you can.
[64:56] Uh, and there's a lot of other
[64:58] Bitcoiners that have started doing it.
[65:00] Shout out to, uh, Mandrich, uh, if you
[65:02] know Mandrich. But, uh, he's doing about
[65:05] 20,000 steps a day, which is just shy
[65:07] of, I think, 10 miles a day. Um, and has
[65:10] loved it. But, so I'm a big walking guy.
[65:13] I'm also a big sun sunlight guy. I
[65:16] actually wrote uh I wrote a small paper
[65:18] on the health impacts of sunlight. And
[65:21] so one of the things I think uh the
[65:23] modern medical establishment got most
[65:26] wrong was this framing sunlight as like
[65:29] specifically harmful due to skin cancer
[65:31] risks. And um I put out a paper, it's on
[65:36] my Twitter
[65:37] account, going through the research that
[65:39] actually getting a lot of sunlight on
[65:42] both your skin, but also via the eyes,
[65:44] visually seeing it. That's why you'll
[65:46] see all my interview and work. I'm out
[65:48] here. I'm so I'm seeing the light. Um is
[65:52] one of the single most important
[65:53] variables in human health. It controls
[65:56] all systems from top to bottom. There
[65:58] are circadian regulation impacts on
[66:00] practically everything. Uh, one of the
[66:02] reasons I loved walking too is like it
[66:04] gets you outside. So, kind of two birds
[66:06] with one stone, but um, you know, both
[66:10] sunlight on the skin and sunlight via
[66:11] the eyes. And you know, basically I
[66:13] would say the research is extremely
[66:15] clear. And if you don't believe me, go
[66:18] download there's an app called
[66:20] Perplexity. It's an AI app like chat GPT
[66:23] and it has a free it's called deep
[66:26] research and it it'll spend five minutes
[66:29] searching all the papers all the
[66:31] scientific publications and you can ask
[66:33] it a question. and it's quite good. And
[66:34] if you don't believe me and you don't
[66:36] want to read my paper, uh, or you think
[66:38] I'm kind of talking my book, go download
[66:40] Perplexity and ask it.
[66:43] Does the current
[66:46] research support the idea that getting a
[66:51] lot of sunlight, even moderately high or
[66:54] even slightly excessive levels of
[66:57] sunlight, that the health benefits
[67:00] massively outweigh the health risks. And
[67:03] you can ask it this question and it'll
[67:05] spend three to five minutes researching
[67:07] it and it'll come back and tell you
[67:10] absolutely yes. Even if you take all of
[67:13] the skin cancer claims at face value, of
[67:16] which there are criticisms and of which
[67:18] you can actually one of the interesting
[67:20] things is people who get the most
[67:23] sunlight are more likely to get skin
[67:25] cancer but much less likely to die from
[67:29] it. Like massively less likely. Um as
[67:33] well as there's different types of skin
[67:35] cancer. People that get very little
[67:37] sunlight are much more likely to get the
[67:40] worst kind. People who get a lot of
[67:42] sunlight are more likely to get the
[67:44] minor kinds, which literally you just
[67:46] get frozen off. But you can ask it this
[67:48] question. It'll tell you, yeah, the
[67:50] health benefits of a lot of sunlight,
[67:53] uh, even slightly excessive amounts,
[67:55] which you don't have to do, uh,
[67:57] massively, massively outweigh the costs.
[68:00] your mortality risk goes down
[68:03] tremendously, even including the skin
[68:06] cancer stuff. So, that's another
[68:08] something I'm I'm well known for. Do you
[68:12] do you apply sunscreen? I do not. Um,
[68:16] so, and I live in Florida and like, you
[68:19] know, I got light hair. I'm you know, I
[68:21] I'm Fitzpatrick, type two skin is the
[68:24] technical term, but blue eyes, blonde
[68:26] hair. Um, you know, and I live in South
[68:29] Florida, so I'm in a very high UV
[68:31] environment.
[68:32] Um, I had to adapt over time. So, don't
[68:36] burn. Getting a sunburn is bad. Sunburns
[68:38] carry risks. You should go out and you
[68:40] should stop short of burning. But over,
[68:43] you know, many years of living in
[68:45] Florida and practicing these things, I
[68:47] just really don't burn even in the
[68:48] Florida sun. Uh, you know, maybe in the
[68:50] middle of June if I'm, you know, laying
[68:52] out there or something. There's also a
[68:54] huge difference between just like laying
[68:56] in the sun tanning and just being
[68:59] outside walking. Think about walking is
[69:02] like you're moving. The light is hitting
[69:04] you from different angles. It's not just
[69:06] like focused on one part of the body. Uh
[69:09] and so that helps it too. It's not I'm
[69:11] not really talking about like some sort
[69:12] of like lay on the the tanning bed and
[69:15] just lay there for hours.
[69:17] Um but so I I don't really need the
[69:20] sunscreen. I don't really burn anymore,
[69:22] but like, you know, if your only option
[69:25] is between a sunburn and sunscreen,
[69:27] yeah, use sunscreen. Like, you don't
[69:29] want to burn. You You should avoid that.
[69:30] It's uncomfortable and it changes the
[69:33] health profile. Um, so one other thing
[69:36] I, you know, I kind of mentioned like,
[69:37] hey, you know, like European ancestry,
[69:40] Fitzpatrick, type two skin. They had a
[69:42] study on um Brits on people from the
[69:46] United Kingdom who moved south. And in
[69:50] this study, they had tens of thousands
[69:51] of participants. They studied life
[69:54] expectancy on, you know, native UK Brits
[69:59] uh that basically moved as south as
[70:01] Egypt, right? So like they're as south
[70:04] as Egypt. Egypt is obviously not the
[70:07] ancestral environment of uh the British
[70:10] people, right? They they live in a very
[70:12] low sunlight environment. And what they
[70:14] found is as a group the Brits that moved
[70:16] to Egypt lived quite a bit longer. It
[70:20] was something like it was really a wild
[70:23] number. It was something
[70:25] like 18 days of life for every like 10
[70:29] miles south that they moved. Uh which is
[70:33] was like huge. It was like it's in it's
[70:35] in my paper, but it it was something
[70:36] absurd like that that um for every mile
[70:40] or every 10 miles or five miles you went
[70:43] south, it was something like you lived
[70:44] 18 days longer on average. Um so even
[70:48] for people that have ancestry uh from
[70:51] northern
[70:52] latitudes, you're still getting a much
[70:55] better health profile going south.
[70:57] That's awesome. That's that's really
[70:59] interesting. Yeah, I get I get some
[71:01] burnt too quick. I I when I go outside,
[71:05] I I usually try to apply sunscreen
[71:07] because I I get red a lot and that I I
[71:11] need that. But I I love I'm I'm just
[71:13] curious u uh about one thing when you're
[71:17] walking because I had a a time in my
[71:20] life where I had to walk to a lot of
[71:22] things and I just walked everywhere
[71:24] without taking the public transport.
[71:27] Yeah, this was an amazing hack. I just
[71:30] skipped when I was walking to work. I
[71:32] was working to some walking so somewhere
[71:34] else. I could have taken like a 20
[71:37] minute uh subway or walked 40 45 minutes
[71:42] and I always opted in for walking and
[71:44] I'm usually when Google meet uh when
[71:47] Google maps tells me oh you need 50
[71:49] minutes I'm there in 30 minutes when I
[71:51] walk because I'm actually quite
[71:54] efficient now in walking and I'm also
[71:56] huge so I have long legs and stuff like
[71:58] that. Yeah. Um but do you take out extra
[72:03] time just for walking? So are you going
[72:06] outside and saying like oh like now one
[72:09] hour I'm just walking around or do you
[72:13] plan it within your day of like oh I
[72:14] have to go there and what I'm also
[72:17] curious do you just walk or do you also
[72:20] hear like audio books podcast or like do
[72:22] you do something with that? Yeah. Yeah.
[72:24] Yeah. So, um, yeah, I get this question
[72:26] a lot because like, you know, the the
[72:29] the amount that I walk like you can only
[72:31] hit it if you're like pretty much
[72:32] walking all day or close to all day. Um,
[72:35] so, you know, I work remote. A lot of my
[72:38] job is calls with clients. I'm the head
[72:40] of private wealth for Swan Bitcoin. So,
[72:42] work with clients navigating, you know,
[72:44] Bitcoin investment landscape. So, I
[72:46] would say like 60% of my job is just
[72:49] phone calls, right? So, I just decide
[72:51] I'm just I'm just going to start
[72:52] walking. I don't need to be sitting in a
[72:54] chair taking a phone call. It's just
[72:56] entirely unnecessary. Uh and then you
[72:59] know
[72:59] emails, Slack messages, these sort of
[73:02] things. And I can do it all on my phone.
[73:04] So yeah, for a lot of I mean I'm working
[73:06] and I'm doing things or you know podcast
[73:09] like audiobooks, Twitter. Yeah, it's not
[73:11] it's not some uh aesthetic pursuit where
[73:14] like I you know I'm just staring ahead
[73:16] for eight hours a day. I get a lot of
[73:18] stuff done. I work. I you know engage.
[73:21] And I love it. And it's just this view
[73:22] where it's like, hey, um, I don't need
[73:26] to be doing this inside. I do not need
[73:28] to be doing this in a chair. There's no
[73:30] reason I need to be in a chair to listen
[73:32] to a podcast or, uh, you know, listen to
[73:35] a book or write some emails or, you
[73:38] know, scroll Twitter or whatever it is.
[73:40] Like, there's just no reason. And, uh,
[73:42] frankly, I enjoy those things more when
[73:44] I'm walking because I feel better and
[73:46] it's just it's comprehensive. So it's um
[73:50] you know got quite a bit to do with that
[73:52] and uh yeah it's less like walking
[73:55] places even like I'm I'm in America it's
[73:57] a more kind of car environment so it's
[74:00] not so easy to walk places and so it's
[74:02] really just just me walking around the
[74:05] vicinity that I live in. Uh it's a nice
[74:08] spot to walk and it's mostly just that I
[74:10] don't typically I'm not like going miles
[74:13] from my house or something cuz also I
[74:15] may need to be back at my computer for
[74:16] certain things and like this podcast. Um
[74:20] but it's just something I just worked in
[74:22] on like a basic level of just like I
[74:24] want to walk more as part of my life.
[74:28] That's super interesting. Do you still
[74:30] do other uh sorry for so many questions
[74:31] around your workout but I'm super
[74:33] interested in that. Do you still do
[74:35] other workouts like I don't know uh
[74:38] weightlifting, calisthenics? Absolutely.
[74:40] No, I'm I'm in the gym four days a week
[74:42] for weight training. So that's uh also
[74:44] kind of a big thing that I love. Uh love
[74:47] weightlifting. Done that for a while.
[74:49] Been, you know, u pretty dedicated
[74:52] pursuit. So, you know, something that uh
[74:54] you know, I'm kind of running uh you
[74:57] know, bulk bulking and cutting cycles
[75:00] the whole thing. uh and and really kind
[75:02] of putting time and energy into that.
[75:04] So, I love that, too. And I've al Some
[75:06] people say, "Well, hey, I want to
[75:07] exercise. I'd rather exercise than
[75:09] walk." Here's the problem. Um let's say
[75:12] you go to the gym every day for an hour.
[75:14] You do hardcore weightlifting. You're
[75:15] probably not doing that because you
[75:16] probably shouldn't do that because you
[75:18] need some rest days. But let's even say
[75:19] you did that.
[75:21] Um what are you doing for the other 11
[75:24] hours? You're sitting in a chair. You
[75:26] haven't solved the problem. Exercise is
[75:29] different than movement. The walking
[75:32] solves your movement problem. You need
[75:34] to move more. You can't be in a chair
[75:37] for 10 hours a day. Uh and even if you
[75:39] go to the gym every day, if you're just
[75:42] sitting apart from that, you still have
[75:44] an issue. So like love, you know, love
[75:47] weightlifting or sports or whatever
[75:48] people are into. I definitely do that.
[75:50] You know, I have a pretty structured
[75:52] schedule with that myself. Like, you
[75:54] know, I'm uh training to failure four
[75:56] times a week. Um, but you just still
[75:59] need to move, you know. It doesn't
[76:00] doesn't it's not a substitute. I guess
[76:02] it's hard for some people um which might
[76:06] have to be on on on the computer for
[76:09] let's say 8 nine hours. Yeah. Um a day.
[76:13] I mean, I'm I'm kind of one of those
[76:17] people. Uh but it's it's it's something
[76:20] I'm I'm I'm aware of. Yeah, that's it's
[76:23] super interesting. Um yeah, like moving
[76:25] around is is really cool. So I kind of
[76:28] got uh sidetracked here.
[76:31] Yeah, we have end routine in the podcast
[76:33] where the previous guest is asking a
[76:35] question for the next guest uh without
[76:37] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[76:38] And so totally different uh topic again.
[76:42] Um the question from previous guest for
[76:44] you is which country will adopt a
[76:46] Bitcoin standard first? Define Bitcoin
[76:49] standard. What do we mean? Uh that's an
[76:52] interesting one. Um, so I know because
[76:56] the question is from a previous guest,
[76:57] so I can only guess what what he meant.
[77:00] Uh, but he specifically said that what
[77:04] El Salvador is doing is not a Bitcoin
[77:07] standard. It's it's it's too bearish for
[77:09] Bitcoin standard. So I guess he meant on
[77:13] the on the way of having Bitcoin as the
[77:18] dominant reserve currency of the the the
[77:22] the nation relies on Bitcoin more than
[77:27] on any other asset. Yeah, that's a tough
[77:29] one. You know, that's a I think we're
[77:32] far from that, you know, so it's hard to
[77:34] really know what the landscape's going
[77:36] to be like. Um, I mean, countries like
[77:40] El Salvador are probably a decent bet
[77:42] that effectively don't have their own
[77:44] currency, right? So, I I this might be
[77:46] kind of a cheap kind of answer, but
[77:49] something like El Salvador probably
[77:51] makes sense. The reason for saying that
[77:53] is just they already don't print their
[77:54] own currency. They were dollarized. And
[77:57] so, for someone to go like full in, I I
[78:00] think it would have to be one of those
[78:01] guys. Uh, so maybe like, you know, the
[78:04] US starts to do Bitcoin things. Bitcoin
[78:07] becomes like a meaningful reserve asset
[78:10] in global finance and uh yeah I mean one
[78:14] one of those dollarized countries. It's
[78:16] a it's just a broad one like it's not
[78:18] like who buys Bitcoin next. It's a you
[78:21] know something we haven't even seen yet
[78:22] if El Salvador doesn't count. Yeah, it's
[78:25] it's
[78:27] definitely a difficult question because
[78:29] it's it's I think also quite people
[78:32] people um people really
[78:36] overestimate how quick this this is
[78:38] going to be. Um yeah, thank you so much
[78:41] uh Stephen for for being on the show.
[78:42] Before I let you go, where can people
[78:43] find you, ask you questions, and reach
