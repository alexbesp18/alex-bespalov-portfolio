[00:00] Bitcoin realigns the incentives so that
[00:02] we can more easily change ourselves
[00:04] under the Fiat system all the incentives
[00:06] are so misaligned and trying to become a
[00:08] better person is like walking up a SE
[00:10] pill with wind and rain uh in your face
[00:12] everything is pushing against you
[00:14] everything is pressuring you to lie
[00:16] cheat and steal but when Bitcoin fixes
[00:18] those incentives then that flips that
[00:20] around if you want to become a good
[00:21] person it's like walking downhill with
[00:23] the sun shining on you and the wind is
[00:25] at your back and all the incentives are
[00:27] pushing and guiding you incentivizing
[00:29] you uh to be more honest have more
[00:31] Integrity have more uh gratitude more
[00:34] generosity money is the way that we
[00:36] communicate value money is so much more
[00:38] than just a piece of paper or just a
[00:40] token or just a number on a screen real
[00:42] money is tied to work and work is tied
[00:45] to while our energy our time both of
[00:48] which are finite when our money is
[00:50] scarce along with our time and our
[00:51] energy and our abilities and all of our
[00:53] resources then it realigns it pulls our
[00:56] lives in that better way as well this
[00:58] unified language for expressing our
[01:01] value our efforts our time our work our
[01:03] energy our resources and and all of that
[01:05] and I see God's fingerprints all over
[01:06] Bitcoin we're not physical beings
[01:08] occasionally having a spiritual
[01:10] experience we Are Spiritual Beings
[01:12] constantly having a physical
[01:13] [Music]
[01:18] experience why is Bitcoin important for
[01:21] you personally why is it important to me
[01:23] personally well okay I have a current
[01:26] answer to that question I'll start with
[01:27] my old answer to that question so I I
[01:30] initially came into Bitcoin uh for the I
[01:33] guess political aspect of it I wanted to
[01:36] you know was a very End the Fed uh Ron
[01:39] Paul supporter libertarian type so I um
[01:43] read the book The Creature From jaal
[01:45] Island uh back in early to mid uh 2015 I
[01:49] had actually just finished uh reading
[01:52] that and two days later my boss at work
[01:55] I was working in a little little office
[01:56] locally here in Chattanooga Tennessee
[01:58] called um Retirement Solutions and he
[02:01] asked me to look up some information
[02:02] just you know uh news articles about uh
[02:05] things happening in the finance world
[02:08] and so it was two days after I finished
[02:10] reading that book that I uh came across
[02:13] Bitcoin and uh start wondering what this
[02:16] was and then doin started listening to
[02:18] Andreas anopolis videos I don't believe
[02:21] in coincidence uh I think that uh
[02:23] there's um definitely a higher hand at
[02:25] work here and um so yeah with only two
[02:29] days sep like that um and so when I
[02:31] initially got into to bitcoin I saw how
[02:34] it could replace the FED how it could
[02:36] fix all these kinds of problems with the
[02:38] with fiat currency not just the US
[02:40] dollar but all Fiat currencies and so
[02:42] really up until mid 2018 so 2015 to 2018
[02:46] those three years there that was my
[02:48] reason but then I read the the Bitcoin
[02:51] standard um and I learned about time
[02:54] preference for the very first time and I
[02:57] I gain I gained a new love for Bitcoin
[03:01] uh in the way that it changes Us From
[03:03] the Inside Out uh so like the first way
[03:05] was more from the outside in but this is
[03:06] more from the inside out so why do I
[03:09] love Bitcoin what is it that that
[03:11] excites me about it it's the way that
[03:12] Bitcoin well it doesn't change us it's
[03:15] not like changing us against our will
[03:17] but it realigns the incentives so that
[03:20] uh we can more easily change ourselves
[03:23] uh I like to think of it like if you are
[03:25] a good person trying to become a better
[03:27] person you like better talents but also
[03:28] maybe more honest and more better
[03:30] Integrity maybe um you have a bad temper
[03:33] and you're trying to uh uh to you know
[03:37] reain that in and and have more control
[03:38] over your life or something under the
[03:41] Fiat system all the incentives are so
[03:44] misaligned that it's as if you are uh
[03:47] like trying to become a better person is
[03:49] like walking up a cliff or not Cliff but
[03:51] a steep hill walking up a steep hill
[03:54] with wind and rain in uh in your face
[03:56] basically everything is pushing against
[03:58] you everything is pressuring you to
[04:01] um uh to to lie cheat and steal um but
[04:07] when you fix those incentives when
[04:09] Bitcoin fixes those incentives then uh
[04:13] that flips that around so now if you
[04:14] want to become a good person it's like
[04:16] walking downhill with the the the sun
[04:18] shining on you and the wind is at your
[04:20] back um and all the incentives are um
[04:24] pushing and guiding you incentivizing
[04:27] you there you go uh to um be more honest
[04:30] have more Integrity uh have more uh
[04:33] gratitude more um uh generosity and
[04:37] everything everything that we all value
[04:39] but it's so hard to um to be th those
[04:42] ways so often I think it's harder in a
[04:44] Fiat system and so much easier in a u uh
[04:48] a system on a Bitcoin
[04:50] standard I love that yeah it's almost
[04:52] like Bitcoin is uh influencing on on on
[04:57] our core values
[05:00] it really touches us on a very deep
[05:04] level because money is so important to
[05:07] us it it's it's kind of magical but also
[05:10] sometimes it's like can it really be
[05:12] that off for before yeah uh yeah I've
[05:17] gone down that rabbit hole I guess
[05:19] mentally multiple times been like really
[05:21] am I am I just going crazy here or does
[05:24] it actually do this um but it's because
[05:26] of what money is money is the way that
[05:29] we communicate value if it was just
[05:31] pieces of paper and someone said hey I
[05:34] have I came up with a better piece of
[05:35] paper this one's on paper this is on
[05:37] computers and uh and it magically makes
[05:40] it so that you uh uh are going to want
[05:43] want to be a better
[05:45] person yeah that sounds crazy but money
[05:48] is so much more than just a piece of
[05:50] paper or just a token or just a number
[05:52] on a screen or anything else like that
[05:54] uh really actually if it's just a number
[05:56] on the screen or if it's just a piece of
[05:57] paper and not tied to any kind of work
[06:00] it's not money at all I wouldn't even
[06:02] call it Fiat money I U or Monopoly money
[06:04] or anything I don't know what I'd call
[06:05] it it's like it's just a uh well what
[06:09] was the the old saying I've heard uh if
[06:11] money grew on trees we would call it
[06:13] leaves uh and so if if money was just
[06:15] paper that was as common As Leaves
[06:17] that's exactly what we' call it we would
[06:18] rake it up we'd burn them and we would
[06:20] uh um not value it at all but because
[06:24] money real money is tied to
[06:28] work and work is tied to well our energy
[06:31] our time uh both of which are finite um
[06:35] and you know our different talents and
[06:36] stuff that we again or is also finite we
[06:39] don't have we're not good at everything
[06:41] uh we all have our different
[06:42] Specialties because of that when our
[06:45] money is scarce along with our time and
[06:47] our energy and our abilities and all of
[06:49] our
[06:50] resources then when we have a better
[06:52] money it it realigns it pulls our lives
[06:56] in that better way as well uh and and so
[06:59] yeah just once you understand what money
[07:01] is then everything clicks and it all
[07:03] makes
[07:04] sense and do you think sometimes that we
[07:08] are uh religious about Bitcoin do you
[07:11] think that that religious aspect of like
[07:13] oh people come together on local meetups
[07:16] uh they they coming
[07:18] together and they are almost like
[07:21] celebrating that magical figure of
[07:24] satosi Nakamoto like there's a lot of
[07:26] elements that you usually have in
[07:28] religion uh in in Bitcoin and I mean um
[07:32] I highly disagree with that but there
[07:34] are people that Callan with uh compar
[07:38] with the prince of peace and Jesus and
[07:40] stuff like that oh wow yeah there are a
[07:43] lot of different routs with like 365
[07:45] podcast episodes I hear a lot of
[07:47] different opinions on a lot of different
[07:49] subjects but uh do do do you do you feel
[07:54] like that we're kind of a religion or or
[07:56] how does Bitcoin intersect do you think
[07:58] with religion I guess it depend on what
[07:59] you mean by religion um I'm really glad
[08:02] you brought up meeting like meetups
[08:04] people coming together the original
[08:06] meaning of the word religion like if you
[08:09] look in the atmology of it it means to
[08:11] bring together again uh like or means
[08:15] again um and so that that which was
[08:18] separate has been brought together now
[08:21] what that has come to mean over history
[08:23] like over time is you know people who
[08:25] have a common Faith a common belief
[08:27] system coming together um to commune
[08:30] together and support each other and then
[08:33] worship you know a deity or multiple
[08:35] deities um it's meant a lot of different
[08:38] things and then more recently it's meant
[08:39] more just like a like a a clear
[08:43] structure of of churches and um uh and
[08:48] practices and rules and you don't do it
[08:50] this way you do it this way things like
[08:52] that and uh it's it's become more Fiat
[08:55] frankly uh a lot of like top down
[08:57] structure of people saying this is what
[08:59] we believe and this then you shouldn't
[09:01] believe that this is what this verse in
[09:03] a b the Bible or any other ply book
[09:05] means U and here's what it doesn't mean
[09:08] but originally yeah it simply
[09:10] meant uh to bring together again and so
[09:14] with that not only is is Bitcoin a a
[09:18] religion according to that original
[09:20] definition
[09:21] um uh in the sense of like bitco meetups
[09:24] and like and us talking like this but
[09:28] also
[09:29] consider just running Bitcoin at all um
[09:32] when when hfny started running Bitcoin
[09:36] uh he was running the same protocol that
[09:39] uh Satoshi was already running and uh I
[09:41] don't care anybody says they're not the
[09:43] same person that's been I'm convinced of
[09:45] that that's been proven that Hal was not
[09:47] Satoshi but um that brought them
[09:50] together sooshi didn't force Hal to run
[09:53] the protocol the same protocol how chose
[09:55] to in the same way uh you know I run a
[09:58] node if you run a node um and when we're
[10:01] using the same Bitcoin then we've just
[10:05] been brought together in that way in a
[10:07] way that no one forced us to we chose to
[10:10] uh of our own free will and so yeah in
[10:13] that sense it is bringing us together
[10:16] again and um and in a really well yeah
[10:20] really decentralized really unifying way
[10:23] we now this unified language for
[10:25] expressing our our value our efforts our
[10:28] time our work uh our energy our
[10:30] resources and and all of that um I would
[10:35] one one last thing here I would well I
[10:37] agree with you that no Satoshi neither
[10:39] Satoshi nor Bitcoin is Jesus Christ and
[10:41] and I am identifi as a Christian myself
[10:44] and and uh so no definitely not I would
[10:48] however say that uh many people um not
[10:52] just Satoshi but many many people
[10:53] throughout history have been inspired by
[10:55] God uh for a lot of different things uh
[10:58] some of them knew it some one guy Nam me
[11:01] like Moses or
[11:02] something knew that he was being
[11:04] inspired by God uh but uh but a lot of
[11:06] other people um Socrates or um uh the uh
[11:12] those who signed the Declaration of
[11:13] Independence uh George Washington thas
[11:15] Jefferson people like that um they okay
[11:19] they may have known but a lot of people
[11:21] don't know it when they're being
[11:22] inspired by God and yet they are there
[11:24] I've actually met a lot of atheists
[11:25] where um like they they don't even
[11:27] believe in the existence of God and yet
[11:29] the things they're saying and doing I'm
[11:30] like I see God's hand all over that so
[11:34] and I see God's fingerprints all over
[11:36] Bitcoin uh and over the things that that
[11:39] Satoshi said so whether he knew it or
[11:41] not I think he was being inspired by a
[11:43] higher
[11:43] power um uh was going to say there oh
[11:47] yeah and and then I would disagree with
[11:49] was it Michael sailor who said like if
[11:50] you worship um the laws of physics and
[11:54] Mathematics I forget the exact quote but
[11:55] he said something something like that
[11:57] like then Bitcoin is your religion and I
[11:59] don't worship those things I worship the
[12:01] creator of those things and uh and and
[12:04] so if if Bitcoin kind of sits on this
[12:06] three-legged stool of um uh physics
[12:09] mathematics and Game Theory then all
[12:12] which I believe came from this higher
[12:14] source the creator of the
[12:16] universe yeah then uh uh then yeah I can
[12:19] see as Bitcoin is kind of an extension
[12:21] of religion in that sense interesting
[12:24] Bitcoin kind of brings us together not
[12:26] only in the essence of like physically
[12:28] bring us together at conferences meet up
[12:30] and stuff like that but also way more
[12:33] important the aspect of um the the the
[12:38] the internet layer of of money when we
[12:41] think about ra when you think about uh
[12:44] Germany and in the area there there are
[12:47] some small areas that are some smaller
[12:49] than a city where there are three
[12:51] different currencies used you have to
[12:53] exchange where when you cross the
[12:55] borders uh and in that sense having one
[12:59] money on the global uh scale that nobody
[13:03] can no human being can manipulate it's
[13:07] almost like God's money uh that no human
[13:11] being can manipulate and it brings us
[13:14] all together because it now doesn't
[13:16] matter where you live or uh what country
[13:20] or jurisdiction you belong to you can
[13:22] just use that money and
[13:25] just interchange with each other which
[13:27] is an amazing thing thing
[13:30] yeah you know actually I hadn't thought
[13:32] of this till just now but um uh well
[13:35] this first part I've thought of before
[13:36] that uh money and language like the
[13:39] words we're speaking right now uh they
[13:41] they kind of are two sides of the same
[13:43] coin um one side it's of this Co of
[13:46] communication let's say so one side is
[13:49] just what is so that's the words that
[13:51] we're saying U this like you know this
[13:53] is a phone uh something like that but
[13:56] the other side is um
[13:59] uh why things matter or like how much it
[14:02] matters so like what it is and why it
[14:04] matters on two two different sides there
[14:07] and that's the money side the the why it
[14:09] matters I think there's a similar so
[14:11] this is a part I had thought of till
[14:12] just now I think there's a similar
[14:14] two-sided coin here um with uh with
[14:18] truth with both science and religion
[14:20] science gets into trouble when it's
[14:22] trying to find out why things matter uh
[14:25] that's not what science is about the
[14:27] science is much more like the the uh
[14:29] verbal communication we're doing right
[14:30] now it tells what is maybe how it is how
[14:34] it works the functionality but religion
[14:37] then tells you or like I mean like
[14:39] religion spirituality Faith anything
[14:42] like that is more of that um that value
[14:46] side that importance uh of things um
[14:49] that that meaning uh of things uh that
[14:53] that uh and and the religion gets into
[14:55] trouble and oh boy going make a lot of
[14:57] other Christians and other religious
[14:59] people angry you when I say this that
[15:00] that religion gets into trouble when it
[15:02] tries to tell um how and what that uh uh
[15:06] for example like this is where I'm gonna
[15:08] get in trouble but uh that that God uh
[15:10] created the world in uh in six days and
[15:12] I I don't I'm not a believer in that
[15:14] kind of strict um uh interpretation like
[15:17] literal interpretation of Parts like
[15:19] that in the Bible um but uh I think I
[15:23] think God is much bigger than than any
[15:25] of that um where was he going oh yeah
[15:28] yeah but um yeah so each side can
[15:31] gets uh can get into trouble trying to
[15:33] cross to the other side and yeah so I
[15:36] never really thought of a parallel like
[15:38] that with science and religion and uh
[15:41] language the like what we're speaking
[15:42] right now and money uh that language and
[15:45] science are kind of on that one side and
[15:47] um the on the the informational side but
[15:50] then religion
[15:52] and I say yeah language I'm not sure if
[15:55] I messed up earlier I apologize but yeah
[15:57] you say if language and science once and
[15:59] then you have money and uh religion on
[16:02] the side of meaning of value of that
[16:05] that kind of less definable stuff love
[16:08] that that that that that is really cool
[16:11] it's almost like there's like a you said
[16:14] before there's a I don't I don't
[16:16] remember how exactly you said there's
[16:18] like a bigger hand guiding us or some
[16:20] something like there's some some bigger
[16:22] force uh and we have uh faith and
[16:27] religion and those core values that
[16:29] explained better of why then the sence
[16:32] of like
[16:34] how of like is is Bitcoin kind of
[16:37] already predetermined and we we we kind
[16:40] of now just figuring out the how that's
[16:43] where my mind was going is still like a
[16:45] bigger hand and already decided Bitcoin
[16:47] is the thing and when we're not trying
[16:50] to figure out with all those second
[16:52] layer Technologies of like oh how how
[16:54] actually G to do it with with Bitcoin
[16:56] because that seems to be the solution
[16:58] for the future
[17:00] is that a fair assumption you think I
[17:03] think so yeah yeah I agree with that
[17:06] um uh yeah see if I trying to think if I
[17:10] had any uh comments on that but not not
[17:12] really I think that pretty much sums it
[17:14] up absolutely really cool perfect one
[17:16] more question on that because we talked
[17:18] about Sakamoto do you think it's
[17:21] important that he is uh not known that
[17:23] we don't know who who he is that is that
[17:26] an important uh thing the story yes I
[17:31] think it's vital uh in fact uh little
[17:34] personal story here I had a dream Once
[17:36] several years ago I sometimes dream of
[17:38] Bitcoin things um and uh uh one dream I
[17:43] had was um where I discovered I forget
[17:46] the details of it but I discovered the
[17:48] actual identity of Satoshi and it was
[17:50] like it was on a piece of paper where
[17:53] you know some things are blurry in
[17:54] dreams um so um I I of course didn't
[17:58] remember what it said anything but there
[18:00] was some information that connected it
[18:03] to some person it was a fictitious
[18:06] person in the dream but I knew exactly
[18:08] who Satoshi was and I also knew that
[18:10] this piece of paper was the only
[18:12] evidence it was not digitally anywhere
[18:14] it wasn't anywhere online this was the
[18:17] only evidence and it would absolutely
[18:19] undeniably prove that it was this one
[18:21] person if I published this abro abroad
[18:23] and so I had a choice to make and at the
[18:26] end of the dream I walked to the
[18:28] fireplace and dropped the paper in the
[18:30] in the fire um that uh I was like no I'm
[18:33] going to take this information to the
[18:34] Grave because I know who it is and now
[18:36] then destroying uh the the paper even if
[18:39] someone and these thoughts came to me as
[18:40] I woke up I was like yeah even as as I
[18:42] was kind of slowly waking up uh even as
[18:45] if uh someone found out that I knew and
[18:48] tortured me for the information and I
[18:50] told them there'd be no way to prove it
[18:52] because the the actual proof had burned
[18:55] they just have to take my word for it um
[18:58] and so
[18:59] uh it just an interesting thought
[19:01] experiment that if I wonder if any of us
[19:03] if any of those listening to this found
[19:06] out some kind of undeniable proof like
[19:08] that about who Satoshi was what would we
[19:10] do with it uh would we just keep it to
[19:12] ourselves would we uh publish it uh
[19:15] would we destroy it um try to you know
[19:18] wipe our own memory of it or what like
[19:21] because so I think we're talking earli
[19:23] about the kind of dualistic science
[19:25] religion and uh Lang language and money
[19:28] um
[19:29] earlier and um I think the importance of
[19:33] Satoshi being um uh Anonymous uh is
[19:38] important in a similar way there's kind
[19:40] of the um on one side the structural
[19:44] importance like keeping Bitcoin
[19:45] decentralized make so that people aren't
[19:47] um trusting well well um let's pretend
[19:51] okay my own personal guess by the way no
[19:53] this is not from any kind of uh I don't
[19:55] have any proof for this anything but my
[19:57] own personal guess about who Satoshi was
[19:59] was Len sassin or I think it's I'm not
[20:02] sure how to say his last name I
[20:03] apologize to to him and his family out
[20:05] there um but uh for any of you who don't
[20:09] know Len was a cipher Punk involved with
[20:12] the other Cipher punks at the beginning
[20:14] of Bitcoin and uh it's very possible
[20:18] that he was you know being lent
[20:20] sometimes and Satoshi other times but
[20:22] unfortunately in mid 2014 he uh oh no 14
[20:27] 2011 sorry mid 201
[20:29] he uh took his own life and it's very
[20:31] tragic but um that's my my personal
[20:35] guess is that so let's say I uh oh yeah
[20:38] oh thank you yeah sassin Ben okay it was
[20:39] the second a I wasn't sure if if that
[20:41] was in there just for my memory yeah um
[20:45] and so it's possible that it was him uh
[20:48] maybe likely maybe not but that's my own
[20:49] personal guess and let's so let's say um
[20:54] uh oh yeah so if it actually was him
[20:56] then people and that was proven and it
[20:58] was known
[20:59] it would first of all make it so that
[21:01] people would start um I guess uh
[21:04] focusing on other things that Len said
[21:06] and like well Satoshi also said this
[21:08] Satoshi or Len also known as Satoshi
[21:11] once said this and this and this and use
[21:13] that as uh um I guess as justification
[21:17] for maybe a change that needs to be or
[21:20] they think needs to be made into Bitcoin
[21:22] I mean we already had people uh we still
[21:24] have people today but especially during
[21:26] the block size Wars had people uh point
[21:28] to the very first words of the white
[21:29] paper it it says their electronic cash
[21:32] system uh and so justifying the the move
[21:35] to bigger blocks and change the Bitcoin
[21:37] cash and stuff um so we already have
[21:39] people doing that and I imagine that
[21:41] that would be happening a lot more if we
[21:44] knew who Satoshi was but using all the
[21:47] the rest of that person's words
[21:48] everything else they've ever said in
[21:49] person or online um and uh as um I I
[21:56] mean I guess kind of a no not kind of
[21:58] really a way of Outsourcing our our
[22:00] thinking saying well Satoshi said this
[22:02] as an appeal to Authority that's what
[22:03] I'm trying to think of uh Z on one hand
[22:06] on the other hand then you you just have
[22:08] the the mythical aspect of it I know uh
[22:11] toor Strite has written and spoken a lot
[22:13] on this uh this mythical aspect of
[22:16] Bitcoin that this
[22:18] is we have so many myths uh today like I
[22:21] don't I don't want to say myth like in a
[22:22] disparaging way um but we have so many
[22:25] things that are of of a mythical caliber
[22:28] even if you completely believe that that
[22:30] they're real like I I believe in a man
[22:32] who died on a cross and was resurrected
[22:35] three days later but that happened 2,000
[22:37] years ago but now we have the story of a
[22:40] of a person who you know who gave us
[22:43] this money and disappeared and that
[22:45] happened I mean he disappeared uh what
[22:48] 14 years ago something like that like a
[22:51] decade and a half ago that that just
[22:54] happened in in in the scheme of things
[22:56] and yet like it's obvious ly not as big
[22:59] as like the story of the resurrection of
[23:01] Christ but it's still it's still a big
[23:04] deal uh this person was never been found
[23:07] and he's never once used the money that
[23:09] he created he has roughly a million of
[23:12] of these Bitcoin and if he ever touches
[23:15] them if they ever move you me everyone
[23:18] will be able to see it but it's never
[23:20] happened here it is um early 20125 and
[23:23] still nothing and uh and I believe that
[23:26] will still never ever happen that was a
[23:29] actually another idea I had a while ago
[23:31] was a uh it's a story idea that that's
[23:34] tossing around my brain but I haven't
[23:35] never had a chance to write it of
[23:36] someone um many many years in the future
[23:40] like centuries into the future who
[23:42] creates a a new Bitcoin wallet and just
[23:46] in this story and uh I'm not sure if
[23:49] you're familiar with the concept of a of
[23:51] a collision in um cryptography um
[23:53] especially with the kind of cryptography
[23:55] Bitcoin uses it's insanely unlikely um
[23:58] where basically you can choose a random
[24:00] seed phrase and what if just what if you
[24:03] happen to accidentally choose satoshi's
[24:06] uh seed phrase um and uh you got you
[24:09] found all his coins they're all right
[24:11] there um I mean that's like you know you
[24:14] pick one atom in the universe and I'll
[24:15] pick another one at random and um and we
[24:18] happen to pick the exact same one in an
[24:21] infinite amount of time sure it's
[24:23] possible in a few centuries it's still
[24:25] so unlikely it's mind-blowing but just
[24:27] for the state Sigma story what if and so
[24:30] in this story the character has uh or is
[24:33] has grown up in a society where uh you
[24:35] know space travel and everything there's
[24:37] uh um uh really high technology but
[24:40] really low time preference people are
[24:42] are peaceful yes but they're um they're
[24:45] not just all like living in harmony
[24:47] together no they're still people are
[24:49] hashing things out and discussing things
[24:51] but there aren't these um uh Fiat
[24:54] systems whether with Fiat money Fiat
[24:56] religion Fiat education Fiat medicine or
[24:58] anything else food uh any of that so
[25:00] it's a much much better world the kind
[25:02] of world we're looking forward to and
[25:03] then this person is kind of put to this
[25:05] test when they discover satoshi's coins
[25:08] what do they do with it and yeah and
[25:10] this was definitely based on that dream
[25:12] that I had had uh Loosely based on it
[25:15] and the story would be about how um well
[25:17] actually so the idea I had was they then
[25:19] use that those coins to sign a message
[25:22] um on the Bitcoin blockchain because now
[25:25] they they have the not the coin sorry
[25:26] they use that that seed phrase they use
[25:28] that private key to sign a message and
[25:30] pretend to be Satoshi and be like I am
[25:33] still here it's been like 400 years or
[25:34] something and like I am still here and
[25:37] then the character goes and destroys a
[25:39] private
[25:40] key and and that's how the story ends
[25:44] and just showing you like even with a
[25:45] million full Bitcoin this is in a day
[25:47] where you could buy a house for like a
[25:49] couple SATs or something because it's
[25:50] hundreds of views in the future um and
[25:54] the person's like nope this is not my my
[25:56] coins and if I use these This Will
[25:59] Destroy um people's faith in this
[26:02] economy and in the story of Satoshi um
[26:05] to say nothing of just the economic
[26:07] factors of uh suddenly reintroducing
[26:09] roughly a million Bitcoin into the um uh
[26:12] the economy uh so um minus all the ones
[26:15] that have been been lost and stuff so
[26:17] you're talking 16 17 million uh Bitcoin
[26:21] full Bitcoin uh circul around in this
[26:23] multiplanetary um uh civilization and
[26:27] now suddenly no no not 16 or 17 not 17
[26:29] or 18 like a million not we just bumped
[26:31] it up by a million um the amount of
[26:35] inflation that would that would cause um
[26:38] and uh so those characters just like no
[26:40] I'm not going to do that and uh and they
[26:42] just know from low time PR like I didn't
[26:44] learn I I didn't earn that money that's
[26:47] not mine and having that self-control
[26:50] that level of self-control to say no for
[26:52] all these reasons I am destroying the
[26:54] private key now and uh uh I don't know
[26:57] if any of us today would be able to like
[27:00] would have that kind of um willpower to
[27:02] do that but just uh this um uh love of
[27:08] humanity and um of doing the right thing
[27:11] would just be so pervasive that even
[27:13] then in that kind of society growing up
[27:16] in that kind of culture a person who
[27:17] accidentally stumbles on that private
[27:20] key uh goes in and uh and just um
[27:24] destroys them
[27:26] um anyway yeah sorry can't rambling now
[27:28] but yeah that's just a story idea that
[27:30] I've had for a little while and now I've
[27:32] told the whole story so I don't know if
[27:33] I'll overwrite it it's an interesting F
[27:36] experiment of of like okay I mean it's
[27:39] it's it's so so so freaking
[27:42] unlikely
[27:44] W what if but what if it's it's a really
[27:48] I think it would make a great story you
[27:51] could even make a kids book out of that
[27:53] or like some some like short movie like
[27:57] that like
[27:59] really good Potentials in there where
[28:01] you can put like human emotions and like
[28:03] a storyline in there around that one so
[28:06] I think it has it
[28:08] as yeah as they wrestle with this like
[28:10] but I could I could use this and I don't
[28:13] know give to people who are in need I
[28:15] could use this and build so many
[28:17] wonderful businesses I could use this
[28:19] for all these different things but and
[28:22] eventually the going through all
[28:23] justifications eventually the market
[28:25] would recover the economy would recover
[28:26] with having this additional supply of of
[28:29] roughly a million more coins but in the
[28:31] end they decide no this is the right
[28:33] thing to do I partnered up with coin
[28:36] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[28:39] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[28:42] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[28:45] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[28:48] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[28:50] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[28:54] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[28:56] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[29:00] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:02] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:06] watch collection you have the date of
[29:08] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:11] there and of course also the block
[29:13] height and which EPO we are currently in
[29:17] I love the level of detail they put in
[29:20] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[29:22] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:25] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[29:28] love those watches so so much if you
[29:31] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:33] regular basis I'll guess you already
[29:35] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[29:38] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[29:41] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[29:44] personal recommendation for Hardware
[29:45] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[29:48] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[29:50] gift for a friend who has still the
[29:53] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[29:56] 5% discount with the the code Robin at
[29:58] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[30:02] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[30:05] step is to really level up your
[30:07] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[30:10] have the most secure self custody setup
[30:13] you have to secure your own devices you
[30:16] have to protect your privacy you have to
[30:18] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[30:21] on where you live you even want to have
[30:24] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[30:26] move in case something goes really
[30:28] really wrong and through all those steps
[30:30] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[30:33] step by step and if you visit the
[30:36] bitcoin.com
[30:38] partners robobin you even get a 30
[30:40] minute free call to find out how you can
[30:43] level up your sovereignty so just hit
[30:46] delete but in a lot of ways I think long
[30:50] term it might even make
[30:52] Bitcoin uh Stronger because I sometimes
[30:55] hear that thing out oh like what if the
[30:59] the 1 million Bitcoin moves and I'm like
[31:01] that's not a problem like it's it will
[31:04] probably if they actually move will
[31:06] probably tank the market shortterm a lot
[31:10] uh or not we don't know but I think it
[31:12] will tank the market a lot but long term
[31:15] it will survive because it's not
[31:17] something with Bitcoin and it's
[31:19] something that is like out of the way
[31:21] and and we don't have to talk about it
[31:23] any more because we have so like it's
[31:26] it's one of the attacks that I think
[31:28] would Bitcoin make would make Bitcoin
[31:31] even stronger but uh coming back to
[31:34] Satori coming back to this I think the
[31:37] keys are anyways gone like I think no
[31:39] one has is in possession of those keys I
[31:42] think Sosi is very likely yet uh who
[31:46] whoever he is um it's also interesting
[31:50] most stories I hear about the toi also
[31:53] about uh as with Len and many others
[31:56] that are compelling
[31:58] all of the compelling songs uh where
[32:01] satosi is
[32:02] dead uh it's true but I I'm I have a
[32:07] very high like uh conviction of that zi
[32:10] is no long uh and this thing is I think
[32:12] we will never find out whoi is there's
[32:15] like we will never find that missing
[32:19] undeniable proof that whoi this um
[32:23] because he was so
[32:25] fearful in exactly avoiding
[32:29] that so many different stories out there
[32:33] and so many different directions it it
[32:36] it's it's just like my only two opinions
[32:38] on sto is he's probably that and we
[32:41] probably never find out anyway so uh why
[32:44] why why
[32:46] B talking about it yeah because it's
[32:50] entertaining yeah yeah it's fun to
[32:52] imagine like yeah who could he have been
[32:54] and uh um yeah I think you have
[32:57] different uh possible scenarios uh
[32:59] another actually this story actually
[33:01] comes from one of my oldest uh kids uh
[33:04] for actually I didn't mention this
[33:05] earlier about fun fact about myself I
[33:07] have six kids um and uh my second oldest
[33:11] is almost
[33:12] 16 and um he and I were talking once
[33:16] several months ago and together we kind
[33:18] of came up with another story idea where
[33:20] Satoshi comes from the year 2140 he's a
[33:23] time traveler but in his version of the
[33:26] Year 2140 it's Beyond dystopian it is
[33:30] the worst of the worst of the worst kind
[33:31] of dystopian uh world but um he and a
[33:35] few others are able to still uh develop
[33:37] time travel and Satoshi looks back in
[33:41] history any kind of records that that he
[33:43] can find and figures out okay sometime
[33:46] there in the early 2000s that's where we
[33:48] had kind of this um uh goldilock Zone
[33:52] sort of like the best case scenario of
[33:55] the the Necessary Technology to
[33:57] introduce something like Bitcoin but the
[33:59] worst of the worst that caused
[34:00] everything to happen over the next
[34:02] Century afterwards um uh hadn't happened
[34:05] yet uh and so he travels back to roughly
[34:08] the year 2000 or or early 2000s or
[34:11] something and then starts to build a
[34:13] life staying secret and but but that in
[34:16] this story Satoshi Nakamoto is his real
[34:18] name uh he just comes from the future
[34:21] and uh you know and then in what was it
[34:24] like August of 2008 he bought the domain
[34:26] for bitcoin.org or it was something like
[34:29] that I forget and then uh and and just a
[34:32] little bit and and sending it the some
[34:34] of the information to Adam back uh and
[34:38] um all that kind of preliminary stuff
[34:40] and then October 31st 2008 he um talks
[34:44] to the um Cypher punks and in this story
[34:47] idea then when he disappeared to move on
[34:49] to other things he uh time travel back
[34:52] to 2140 but now a different version of
[34:55] of
[34:56] 2140 uh to see okay now that Bitcoin
[34:59] exists in this new version of the past
[35:01] how have things changed in the future
[35:03] and uh and he goes there and and sees
[35:06] what whatever that'll end up being but
[35:08] that that's just another idea that like
[35:10] oh yeah what if he was a time traveler
[35:11] he didn't die of course I don't believe
[35:13] that for a second but I'm just saying
[35:14] it's fun to to imagine it's fun to kind
[35:16] of fantasize who was he was he a time
[35:19] traveler an alien was he just a dude
[35:21] just just a guy who woke up one morning
[35:23] oh hey what what if we put the hash cash
[35:26] stuff and combined with this and then
[35:28] had this difficulty adjustment and
[35:29] things and what if we just did that and
[35:31] and that's much more likely that was
[35:33] something more like that but we'll never
[35:35] really know uh but it's fun to uh to
[35:37] speculate about I guess yeah when you're
[35:39] done speculating about the price you
[35:41] start to speculate about things like
[35:42] this yeah what I'm at this point where
[35:45] I'm like uh it got so many speculations
[35:49] around the price anyways already where
[35:51] I'm like okay there a lot of variants
[35:54] that can actually happen and I'm anyways
[35:57] all it like why should price obviously
[36:01] like if if if it goes up my netw worth
[36:04] goes up if it goes down I can buy
[36:06] cheaper with the income that I have so
[36:11] anyways it doesn't make a difference for
[36:12] me like I didn't hope for anything like
[36:14] I'm young so I would benefit from a
[36:16] longer speak of like lower price but
[36:20] also if it shots up I'm not going to
[36:25] complain um but yeah it's very fun to
[36:29] talk about uh if do time traveler also
[36:33] really interesting uh do Nakamoto an
[36:36] alien that comes on Earth and they kind
[36:40] of want a civilize Earth but they're
[36:42] like oh [ __ ] like what what money they
[36:44] are using of first let's give them L
[36:46] money let's let's put things on place so
[36:49] they kind expand as a civilization and
[36:51] they kind of put us in the right
[36:52] direction I mean very unlikely but I'm
[36:55] imagine and then another part of like
[36:59] what if there's like multiple Dimensions
[37:02] the time traveling thing maybe just like
[37:04] in that in that time D thing where there
[37:06] is Bitcoin and there's like multile
[37:08] dimensions of multiple realities I
[37:13] gu it's very far very confusing for the
[37:16] human mind
[37:17] to understand it's it's just it's it's
[37:20] easier to just think like oh there's
[37:22] like one world there we there's no time
[37:25] traveling there's no aliens that's like
[37:27] like nothing coming to us but it's not
[37:30] impossible I feel like it's also I I I I
[37:34] do like the theory that then we we might
[37:38] just play a really realistic video game
[37:40] because sometimes it just feels like
[37:42] there there's something programmed there
[37:44] something like oh like this went
[37:46] interestingly smooth like like this was
[37:49] weird weird going like why is that
[37:51] happening to me now and stuff like that
[37:54] I'm like okay if you look at video games
[37:56] 50 years ago they were like really bad
[37:58] and you can easily distinguish them if
[38:00] you now play let's say FIFA like the
[38:03] football game the soccer game uh and you
[38:06] just take a quick look you don't know if
[38:08] that's a real game not because it's like
[38:10] has the same camera view and from far
[38:12] you don't know if that person is an
[38:13] actual football play or not and so what
[38:16] if so uh the the video games get so good
[38:19] that we don't even know like if we are
[38:21] in one or not uh but then again I I try
[38:26] to stay away from those fears
[38:29] he can bring you to an interesting place
[38:30] in the
[38:32] mind yeah and and they're impossible to
[38:34] prove one way or the other I think the
[38:36] term uh philosophers and scientists use
[38:38] is non-falsifiable uh I'm not I'm not a
[38:42] I don't I'm not a scientist so I'm like
[38:44] is that the right term but yeah so it's
[38:46] not really something you can't compare
[38:49] it to something else um that's outside
[38:52] of it and so it again can be a fun
[38:55] thought experiment um and personally I
[38:58] think that uh uh there's uh way too much
[39:01] consistency uh to to the universe and to
[39:05] just the to life and the world around us
[39:08] um but yeah maybe or maybe that's
[39:10] exactly what what God did is he created
[39:13] this uh kind of simulation for us oh
[39:16] what was the there was a saying I heard
[39:19] one time uh many years ago um I think
[39:21] remember it's a we're not physical
[39:24] beings occasionally having a spiritual
[39:25] experience we Are Spiritual Beings
[39:28] constantly having a physical
[39:30] experience and
[39:32] so I think that's what this physical
[39:34] experience is is maybe call it a
[39:37] simulation if you want but uh it it's um
[39:41] but I don't believe it would be created
[39:43] by a finite Hand by by you know there's
[39:46] always that you know some imperfections
[39:50] here and there even if you know we get
[39:53] really really really good that our minds
[39:54] can't notice any of the differences or
[39:57] like any of the um inconsistencies and
[39:59] stuff the the inconsistencies and um
[40:03] lack of perfectness is still there lack
[40:05] of perfection is still there but in this
[40:09] world it just like we just keep digging
[40:11] and digging discovering more and more um
[40:14] and it it stays consistent um so if it
[40:18] was if this is some kind of simulation a
[40:20] physical simulation uh from some higher
[40:23] power then uh then yeah it would have to
[40:26] be from some infinitely higher power
[40:28] some infinitely knowledgeable and
[40:30] Powerful being uh that that created all
[40:33] of this and uh created all of it for us
[40:35] so that we can learn and grow and just
[40:37] experience all this and uh um find find
[40:41] joy in all the things that we
[40:42] experience yeah the alien theory is kind
[40:45] of my my favorite one from that because
[40:47] that that's the the thing that I can
[40:49] most imagine uh the multiple game being
[40:55] a video game or like the time traveling
[40:57] that I I have a hard time going there
[41:00] with my mind for fun yeah but I can
[41:03] imagine that we are not the only ones
[41:06] here and a lot of other planets that we
[41:10] don't even know about like once we
[41:13] didn't knew about certain areas on
[41:16] Earth uh so it's possible that we also
[41:19] don't know about areas outside of Earth
[41:21] maybe we don't even know all the areas
[41:22] on earth like who knows that I don't
[41:25] know if we traveled all the oceans I
[41:27] have no clue about that but I also don't
[41:29] research that part of of of Earth um so
[41:34] it's it's easier for me to uh to imagine
[41:37] of like oh there's other Liv forms they
[41:40] were're developing faster than us it's
[41:43] also something it's almost arrogant to
[41:45] say that we are the only very Advanced
[41:50] species like the chances of that are
[41:52] actually low that we the only ones like
[41:55] the chances are way higher that we are
[41:56] not as Advanced as we think and that
[41:59] there's way more advanced stuff out
[42:01] there but yeah that's just speculation
[42:03] like I have no clue if that's actually
[42:06] what's going on but coming maybe back to
[42:08] sorry you
[42:09] want one of that so um oh yeah oh yeah
[42:12] well the only thing I was going to say
[42:13] is that you're actually touching on
[42:15] another favorite subject of mine from
[42:17] long before Bitcoin there's a book and a
[42:19] movie based on it called Contact by Carl
[42:21] Sean more so in the movie I don't think
[42:23] it's ever said in the book but there's a
[42:24] line said a couple times in the movie
[42:27] mid mid 90s movie that says uh like if
[42:31] it is like with all the different stars
[42:33] and galaxies out there and different
[42:35] planets going around these different
[42:36] Stars if it is really just us sounds
[42:39] like an awful waste of space like
[42:41] looking that there it is yeah I love
[42:43] that movie and uh yeah it's something
[42:45] like just mathematically if you take all
[42:48] of the uh galaxies that are out there
[42:51] and all the different
[42:53] stars and you just say that one out of
[42:56] out of a million of those Stars has
[42:59] planets around it and one of all one of
[43:01] a million of all those stars of planets
[43:04] around it has uh planet with intelligent
[43:06] life and uh one out of a million of
[43:09] those stars with a planet with
[43:10] intelligent life has or with life is
[43:14] intelligent life that that's right then
[43:16] you're still talking billions of planets
[43:19] like Earth with intelligent beings on it
[43:23] um and uh like out there throughout the
[43:26] Universe and they make the point that
[43:28] yeah so therefore if it is just us and
[43:30] all the rest of the universe the whole
[43:32] universe is just a bunch of um uh
[43:35] planets and and stars and rocks and
[43:38] stuff like that and gases and that's it
[43:40] and we're the only living um intelligent
[43:44] beings and by intelligent I mean like we
[43:46] have time preference and we can design
[43:48] things and build things and stuff we can
[43:50] manipulate the world around us if that's
[43:53] it then yeah that is a colossal waste of
[43:56] space
[43:57] um and uh and so while I'm I believe in
[44:00] God I also believe that he did not just
[44:02] create us uh that uh he has a whole
[44:06] universe of Creations that uh to say
[44:09] this is a pin prick the our whole planet
[44:12] is just a pin brick of this entire
[44:15] tapestry uh of uh the universe of
[44:18] reality that itself would still be
[44:20] arrogant like no we're so much less than
[44:22] that uh and yet I also believe that uh
[44:26] that this higher being this higher power
[44:28] has this tremendous infinite love for
[44:31] all for all of us and so it's like to to
[44:33] him or to to this being we are
[44:35] everything like we and uh like we matter
[44:38] so much and now we're getting back to to
[44:41] u meaning and matter like let not matter
[44:44] like the stuff matter but like when
[44:45] things matter uh to us and uh back to
[44:48] side of like money and
[44:50] religion um and uh yeah so that's all I
[44:53] want to say is that that that's another
[44:54] favorite topic of mine uh is just a
[44:57] think about how huge the universe is how
[45:00] small we are and yet how much we still
[45:03] matter that we can still have such a
[45:05] great um impact on the uh uh on the
[45:10] world around us and and other people
[45:12] around us that's why I I love I don't
[45:16] know if uh if if Bitcoin wouldn't be
[45:18] around maybe I would be really hard on
[45:20] on on Space uh and stuff and space
[45:23] travel and like a maybe like a a space
[45:27] NASA podcast I'm I'm right now actually
[45:31] not that um hard on that stuff
[45:35] uh that's probably mostly because I have
[45:38] something that I really am passionate
[45:41] about with Bitcoin uh something really
[45:44] hopefully
[45:45] Earthly uh but yeah those stuff is
[45:48] really fascinating for me um but maybe
[45:51] let's bring it for for the last part of
[45:53] the podcast a little bit back the
[45:55] Bitcoin again
[45:57] we took it off there for a little
[45:59] bit um you're also in in nost with
[46:02] Atlantis which is think so maybe as a as
[46:06] a beginning question for that what role
[46:08] do you think has the combination of
[46:11] Bitcoin and
[46:13] Nostra uh uh what role does that play in
[46:16] our freedoms well um and kind of Hing
[46:19] back to what I was saying that that
[46:20] two-sided coin there that Duality um
[46:24] with Bitcoin being this decentralized
[46:25] way of communicating value Noster is a
[46:28] decentralized way of communicating data
[46:30] communicating
[46:31] information um it's uh so like Bitcoin
[46:34] it's not controlled by anybody there's
[46:36] no Central um company or or anything
[46:39] else like that but it's also it also
[46:41] doesn't have a token like so many other
[46:43] things we've seen in like the crypto
[46:45] scene well they'll they'll say it's
[46:47] decentralized but of course they have a
[46:48] token which actually uh keeps it
[46:51] centralized on on the people who who
[46:54] created it but because there's no token
[46:56] with it people can just copy the
[46:58] protocol run it on their own
[47:00] machine uh and then um uh and then add
[47:06] different nips to it and stuff create
[47:07] their own apps and
[47:10] so uh yeah both Bitcoin and Noster are
[47:13] so vital to um our communication to
[47:16] freedom of communication um so that uh
[47:21] uh yeah really undoing uh censorship of
[47:23] all kinds uh in any way I I think every
[47:27] time we talk about Freedom uh like with
[47:29] Bitcoin or Noster um I I always want to
[47:32] talk about
[47:33] responsibility U of keeping your own
[47:35] private key of um knowing that what what
[47:38] you say on Noster and what you transact
[47:40] with Bitcoin is uh irreversible now that
[47:43] that comes with a Nuance a little bit of
[47:45] a Nuance with especially with Noster
[47:46] that uh um uh you can still ask the the
[47:50] relays no amethyst does this uh where
[47:53] you know you can post something and it
[47:55] goes out through your relay into all the
[47:57] other relays then um if you want to
[47:59] delete it you can request that it be
[48:01] deleted and you're sending a message to
[48:03] all the relays saying hey could you
[48:04] please delete this this previous message
[48:06] they could say no and and they they
[48:08] won't reverse it um and I guess
[48:11] similarly in Bitcoin you could send
[48:12] someone some Bitcoin you realize oops no
[48:15] I totally didn't mean to do that and um
[48:17] and then request for them to send it
[48:18] back to you um and maybe they will maybe
[48:21] they won't uh I know there have been
[48:23] times somebody sent the like they were
[48:25] using some wallet for the first time
[48:26] time and um they sent they're planning
[48:30] on sending like a large amount like a
[48:31] whole Bitcoin or something as the
[48:33] transaction and just a little bit of STS
[48:35] as the fee but they got that swapped
[48:37] they sent a little bit of SATs as a
[48:38] transaction they sent like a whole
[48:40] Bitcoin as the fee I've heard things
[48:42] like that thing was multiple Bitcoins
[48:44] and uh I know of at least one one maybe
[48:47] two different um times in the past I can
[48:49] just bring to memory where the person
[48:52] who did that contacted the mining pool
[48:54] that mined that next block and explained
[48:56] the situation they looked at the
[48:57] transaction that's exactly what it
[48:59] looked like and they went they obliged
[49:01] and reversed it but I know of at least
[49:03] of a time where um the person reached
[49:06] out to them tried to contact them and uh
[49:09] and they never heard back or the the
[49:11] pool said sorry there's no way for us to
[49:13] verify if you're telling the truth so
[49:15] we're we're just going to keep it sorry
[49:17] um or it's already been distributed to
[49:19] all the the people in the pool so
[49:21] there's nothing we can do about it now
[49:24] um and so like while while both with
[49:26] Nostra and Bitcoin you can request a
[49:28] reversal uh it really still comes down
[49:31] to um you knowing what you're doing and
[49:34] you being accountable for your own
[49:37] choices whether those choices are with
[49:39] uh words you're saying or with money
[49:41] you're sending I'm getting another
[49:42] message here that uh my computer's
[49:44] having difficulty connecting okay it
[49:45] just disappeared so maybe we're fine I
[49:47] just wanted to give a heads up I still
[49:50] perfectly
[49:52] fine okay cool yeah so um
[49:56] what was I saying there oh yeah so there
[49:58] there's that responsibility aspect there
[50:01] and uh um and I can't I personally can't
[50:05] imagine Frank okay first of all I
[50:06] couldn't imagine Noster before Noster
[50:08] came
[50:09] around though I was trying to I was
[50:11] trying to imagine it I was like oh it'
[50:13] be so great if we had something where we
[50:14] could communicate some kind of social
[50:16] media thing um where no one's in charge
[50:19] well I don't think there's anything else
[50:21] I there's a third side to this at all I
[50:23] think those are the two kind different
[50:24] kinds of communication uh communting
[50:27] value communicating information and uh
[50:30] and so I don't I don't anticipate there
[50:31] being something else you know that's
[50:34] kind of like how Noster and Bitcoin are
[50:36] really two very separate things I don't
[50:37] think it's a third separate thing I
[50:39] think it's just those those two um then
[50:41] they can be integrated together but
[50:43] um uh and before Noster came around I
[50:47] was on the lookout for any kind of
[50:49] decentralized social media uh any kind
[50:51] of uh communication thing where I
[50:53] wouldn't have to worry about censorship
[50:54] and I could be fully in control of uh of
[50:57] everything that I write and and say and
[51:00] um and yeah I do believe we found that
[51:02] with Noster but I think Noster is also
[51:04] more than what people are saying it kind
[51:06] more and also Less in some ways than
[51:07] what people are saying uh more in the
[51:09] sense that it I I don't think it's just
[51:11] for social media but also less I don't
[51:15] think it's
[51:16] um uh like these apps that that are
[51:20] using Noster um I heard someone say one
[51:22] time that Noster like the protocol
[51:24] itself is um the identity layer for the
[51:28] internet uh so not so it's not like a
[51:31] totally new internet it's not a separate
[51:34] internet side by side there's already
[51:36] the internet stack and it can just be
[51:38] slipped in there as the identity layer
[51:42] um and so other websites that you're
[51:44] already using other services that we're
[51:46] already using online could simply adapt
[51:48] Noster start implementing that on their
[51:49] on the back end excuse me um and then
[51:54] everyone can start interacting on there
[51:56] with the same um identity the same uh
[51:59] nsec that they're using elsewhere so
[52:02] rather than logging in to someplace with
[52:06] your your Google identity and with your
[52:07] Facebook Identity or your Twitter
[52:09] Identity or a whatever identity uh
[52:11] instead of using those other centralized
[52:14] systems those platforms to sign in
[52:16] you're just using this basic protocol
[52:18] That No One controls and you can log
[52:20] into everything the exact same way uh
[52:24] and uh you can verify oh this one one
[52:26] person on this website is the same
[52:28] person uh on as you know on this other
[52:31] website because the npub is exactly the
[52:33] same you can prove that
[52:34] cryptographically just looking at the UB
[52:37] um and even easier methods as well and
[52:41] um oh where was I going with that uh see
[52:45] oh yeah yeah so I think it's not just
[52:47] decentralized communication but
[52:48] decentralized um uh identity management
[52:52] uh for the
[52:54] internet and uh what what you're trying
[52:58] to do with with santis right yeah and so
[53:02] at santis uh yeah we had really brought
[53:04] up yet in this conversation at Atlantis
[53:07] uh we are building really a super app
[53:09] like a combination of a lot of different
[53:11] things uh rather than having um Trip
[53:14] Advisor for when you're going into this
[53:16] one place and like some other city um
[53:19] and a Facebook group for different
[53:21] things you're interested in and for for
[53:23] people who live near you in your city um
[53:26] and meetup.com for different events that
[53:28] are happening in your area and Yelp for
[53:31] uh reviews for different uh uh Merchants
[53:34] there in your city just bring all that
[53:36] together so that there's one place where
[53:39] you can communicate with people locally
[53:41] to you um to other cities you either
[53:44] have plans to visit or or haven't ever
[53:46] visited before um and uh and then you so
[53:50] you can communicate with the people
[53:50] there you can see the events that are
[53:52] happening there at um in those different
[53:54] cities uh you can go to a map we have a
[53:56] whole Merchant map uh in all the
[53:58] different cities and see all the
[53:59] different Merchants there um and sort it
[54:02] you so you can find all the merchants in
[54:03] a city that except Bitcoin um uh ones
[54:06] that maybe advertised as being seed oil
[54:08] free uh or anything else like that
[54:10] whatever may may suit your your
[54:12] interest then the other power so kind of
[54:15] kind of tied with that whole identity
[54:17] layer of Noster Noster then allows us to
[54:19] build a social graph of uh for
[54:23] everything you've done everyone you've
[54:24] connected with uh through it you know
[54:26] noer um that again like if you're just
[54:29] looking at someone's Social graph on X
[54:32] on Twitter but they're also using
[54:34] Instagram those two social grafts do not
[54:37] connect they're they're not on the same
[54:38] plane they don't they don't communicate
[54:39] with each other at all it's actually
[54:41] it's a lot like using U two different
[54:43] kinds of currencies except these they
[54:45] don't really exchange well with each
[54:47] other maybe someone you're following on
[54:49] on X or Twitter or whatever isn't on
[54:52] Instagram or Facebook or anything else
[54:55] like any of these others only on on
[54:57] X um and so um Nostra then gives us this
[55:02] ability this really unique ability to uh
[55:05] curate what you're seeing on and this is
[55:07] what we're plan on doing on stantis it's
[55:09] still extremely early days right now but
[55:11] the long-term plan for Atlantis is uh we
[55:14] are going to build it so you have this
[55:16] unique experience that is relevant to
[55:18] you and your interests based on the
[55:20] people you follow the people you
[55:21] interact with on Noster so like imagine
[55:26] when when you go on to something like
[55:28] Yelp or uh Google Maps and you look up a
[55:31] business and you see that it has uh 4.5
[55:35] stars and you see okay it has 36 reviews
[55:39] giving it an average of 4.5 stars but
[55:41] you don't know any of these people like
[55:44] any of them maybe they have completely
[55:46] different tastes than you maybe they're
[55:48] like you you are looking for a really
[55:50] good seed oil free maybe even carnivore
[55:52] uh uh restaurant and most of uh and and
[55:56] you look up One Restaurant then it has a
[55:58] a 1.5 rating and maybe those people who
[56:01] rated it were vegetarians and vegans
[56:03] like you don't know um and so we we
[56:07] generally will choose to follow the
[56:10] kinds of people um on through Noster and
[56:12] just anywhere else um who we agree with
[56:15] or we are interested in what they have
[56:16] to say we see we have similar values as
[56:20] them so the idea that we have for santis
[56:23] is you can go on or you will be able to
[56:25] go on to the map
[56:27] and um uh look up a a business and see
[56:30] reviews on it but these reviews will be
[56:33] from people you like right at the top of
[56:35] the list you'll see the reviews from the
[56:36] people you follow and maybe even the
[56:38] people they follow but will'll be able
[56:40] to build that that set of reviews based
[56:43] on your social graph to give you the
[56:45] most uh relevant most curated experience
[56:49] uh that way uh you're only seeing things
[56:51] that matter to you or at least most
[56:53] likely things that matter to you and uh
[56:56] and that's not just for reviews but it's
[56:58] also for what people think of the city
[57:00] in general there's a whole like scores
[57:02] page on on on the city um as well as
[57:05] posts that have been placed there on the
[57:06] city seeing ones from people the people
[57:08] you follow are people closest to you in
[57:10] in the social graph um as well as events
[57:13] and just everything so so you and I on
[57:17] Atlantis will get an entirely maybe not
[57:19] entirely but very but different
[57:21] experiences slightly at least slightly
[57:23] different experiences yeah and just that
[57:25] that way and this just something that
[57:26] nostro allows us to do that was never
[57:28] able to be done before um yeah I was
[57:31] going to say that way
[57:33] um Atlantis can become a tool to help
[57:36] you in your life off of the computer so
[57:39] you can uh visit places visit people and
[57:42] do things according to your interest
[57:44] what can we learn from you besides
[57:46] Bitcoin besides Bitcoin I
[57:50] think well yeah we can learn from me
[57:53] personally it's hard to answer that
[57:54] question without sound like I'm you know
[57:56] talking myself up or something kind of
[57:59] being prideful or something but um I
[58:03] guess so I'll flip that question around
[58:05] a little bit like what would I like to
[58:06] to teach what would I like to share with
[58:08] bitcoiners besides that uh like besides
[58:11] Bitcoin itself and I think how do I put
[58:13] this into words like I'm all about like
[58:16] human interactions online is nice but in
[58:19] person is best um it's one of the
[58:23] reasons why I started a Meetup in my
[58:25] hometown of Chattanooga Tennessee I live
[58:28] just south of there so not not actually
[58:29] I'm not even in Tennessee I'm in Georgia
[58:32] but um um I started that because the
[58:35] interactions online were just not enough
[58:38] I I wanted actual connections with
[58:41] people and I wouldn't really call myself
[58:43] an an extrovert uh like so uh according
[58:46] to like the uh you know the mbti test
[58:50] the mysb test I'm uh uh was it um uh
[58:54] infp uh so I'm an I not an e I'm an
[58:57] introverted not
[58:58] extroverted and uh and so I I find
[59:03] Greater Joy and more
[59:05] um uh I get better recharged from
[59:09] spending time alone out like in a
[59:11] library or at at the forest or something
[59:13] like that but I still need just a few
[59:16] people to connect with I need the those
[59:18] eyes to look into the hands to shake um
[59:22] and people to um find that connection
[59:25] with oh oh there you yeah um oh mediator
[59:28] I didn't even know it's called that
[59:30] maybe I did a long time ago and I forgot
[59:32] but
[59:33] um uh but yeah I know Tessa has infp
[59:37] before um so even someone like me's more
[59:40] introverted I still needed something I
[59:42] still needed something that um couldn't
[59:46] be connect with other
[59:47] people and uh help me to see and feel
[59:51] what they're feeling just said point out
[59:53] empathy right there uh huh in search of
[59:55] a calling well that goes right there
[59:57] with my uh um my handle like on Twitter
[60:01] and Noster and stuff I go I go by geeky
[60:03] guy uh which is uh kind of a a
[60:06] combination of the word geek and the
[60:08] Japanese word ieki guy basically your
[60:12] your calling guys your calling or your
[60:15] your purpose in life um and oh man I was
[60:18] searching for that all the time so um
[60:21] after the call could you send me a link
[60:22] to this I haven't read this um
[60:26] but uh I've read some others but years
[60:28] ago um and uh just uh skimming it as
[60:32] you're going through it there I'm like
[60:33] oh wow that's that's hidden right there
[60:36] but uh anyway so how we interact in our
[60:41] um with other people
[60:44] daily just so that people because there
[60:47] people that just listen uh I pulled up
[60:50] next to the oh yes uh the side from 16
[60:56] alties where it's explained the infd FB
[61:01] type that he said he is and it really
[61:04] hit home so like if if someone was
[61:06] listening it was probably very confusing
[61:08] three minutes right
[61:10] now yeah thank you thanks for explaining
[61:12] that yeah yeah he was showing me a
[61:14] website with all that and uh oh what was
[61:19] I gonna say about oh yeah yeah so what
[61:21] you get from
[61:22] me um I guess the yeah you can get from
[61:25] me the importance of uh of genuine human
[61:28] interaction and like in person
[61:30] interaction and you know gen we can
[61:32] still be genuine and have human
[61:34] interactions over things like video
[61:36] calls and your podcasts tweets um uh uh
[61:40] chat uh groups and anything like that of
[61:43] course um but there's nothing that can
[61:46] replace that uh genuine in-person uh
[61:50] connection and interaction and not with
[61:52] people who think just like you you don't
[61:55] want to find yourself with with uh yes
[61:57] men you know people who just agree with
[61:59] everything you say but with people whose
[62:02] values are aligned they maybe their
[62:04] interests are aligned but still have um
[62:07] a different perspective on things
[62:09] different ways of seeing things and so
[62:11] you can kind of rub off rub on off on
[62:14] each other and and smooth each other out
[62:16] like a bunch of stones and then they
[62:17] become a a nice smooth Stone polished um
[62:22] and
[62:23] uh um yeah so I think
[62:26] that and oh yeah yeah just that and the
[62:29] whole idea of Bitcoin and U interacting
[62:33] with other bit bitcoiners especially
[62:34] because that's a big Value Point uh that
[62:37] we all um agree with that we all um are
[62:41] aligned
[62:42] with um that can help us with all those
[62:45] interactions uh to then uh be better
[62:47] people and uh and and be a happier
[62:50] person overall really cool I uh I love
[62:54] that they really cool and I I sent you
[62:56] uh the the link so maybe you can check
[62:59] it out later I think it's it's really
[63:01] interesting to to read to take those
[63:03] tests and then read through that I'm
[63:04] like all right who really knows me but
[63:06] yeah so it's is exactly for that um we
[63:11] have entertain the podcast where the
[63:12] previous guest is asking question for
[63:14] the next uh for the next guest without
[63:16] knowing who the next guest actually is
[63:18] and the question from the previous guest
[63:20] for you is how do you look at the
[63:24] financialization of bit Bitcoin mining
[63:26] in the future basically traditional
[63:28] Finance is taking more more of the
[63:30] Bitcoin mining how do you how do you
[63:31] look at that uh let me see let me see if
[63:33] I understand the question correctly so
[63:35] like how do I look at uh how Bitcoin
[63:37] mining is being like financialized by
[63:39] the old by the like the Legacy system
[63:42] yeah basically we we came from everybody
[63:45] can mine with their own laptop and now
[63:47] we have those huge farms that are
[63:50] publicly traded companies and stuff like
[63:51] that and it moves in that direction uh
[63:54] even though there are a lot of rabbits
[63:57] and horses how how buet would call them
[63:59] still out there uh but yeah like that
[64:02] kind of move to the financialization of
[64:05] Bitcoin um my answer to that like how I
[64:07] how I see that is that's life that's
[64:10] just how it is um Bitcoin is for
[64:13] everyone Bitcoin mining is for anyone
[64:15] who wants to uh or wants to and has the
[64:18] ability to and stuff has access to uh to
[64:20] the all the necessary materials and so
[64:23] the the very rich are are going to mine
[64:26] that's just the fact it's just the
[64:27] reality of it the um the the big players
[64:31] will get into it and the incentives are
[64:34] set so that while yes they're making a
[64:36] lot of money they are also protecting
[64:39] your money and
[64:41] so um yeah so it it evens out it's it's
[64:45] great and we can all still get something
[64:47] like a bit ax or um I'm actually
[64:49] expecting a couple um uh heat bits to
[64:53] arrive uh sometime soon next couple
[64:54] weeks um and for those who don't know a
[64:56] heat bit is a uh Bitcoin miner that's
[64:59] been um essentially turned into a uh a
[65:02] space heater uh and I usually work do a
[65:04] lot of my work from uh my garage uh and
[65:07] in the winter time it gets very very
[65:09] cold in there and so having a heat bit
[65:11] in there and uh mining Bitcoin and um
[65:15] and feeling uh feeling warmer yeah there
[65:17] it is he's showing a website of it right
[65:19] now and
[65:21] um uh you don't get paid tons from it
[65:24] but uh and I don't yet know I know that
[65:27] in the past you couldn't direct your
[65:30] your hash towards whatever pool you
[65:31] wanted to um but maybe the they're and
[65:34] they said a long time ago they're going
[65:35] to to do that at some point uh my my
[65:39] advice I just on the side note my advice
[65:41] to people who might be considering
[65:43] getting a heat bit or something like it
[65:44] some kind of space heater that so mins
[65:46] Bitcoin then they use the heat um to
[65:48] heat their home is only get it if you
[65:50] need to also heat your home so if you if
[65:52] you need a space heater anyway may as
[65:54] well earn a little bit of stats on the
[65:56] side for it but it will at least I don't
[65:59] think it will ever pay itself off or
[66:01] anything like that but if you need a
[66:03] space heater anyway you have a choice
[66:05] get one that just sucks away energy and
[66:07] you just spend money that could
[66:08] otherwise be SATs or you get one that
[66:12] gives you a little bit back you know so
[66:14] it's uh it's all all about the same like
[66:18] so you know so it evens out and then
[66:19] it's uh um worthwhile in that case if
[66:22] you need a space heater anyway to get
[66:24] something like a heat bit
[66:26] um or I see the the S9 kits there they
[66:29] sh on the screen anything else like that
[66:31] and that's also really interesting I
[66:33] never saw that that they're even doing
[66:35] the air
[66:38] purification oh man yeah I'll love that
[66:40] when they arrive but um yeah and so if
[66:44] you run your own um uh Miner if you just
[66:48] mining at home um generally speaking you
[66:50] can point your hash at any pool that you
[66:52] want um and uh and so even if not a big
[66:56] player you can still
[66:58] uh uh I guess you can still get paid
[67:01] some and help to decentralize the
[67:03] network a little bit more help
[67:04] decentralize mining uh just a little
[67:06] more and that's that's the thing this is
[67:07] all a team effort I don't want to be all
[67:09] like you know we're all in this together
[67:11] or something I don't mean that but this
[67:12] is a an individualized effort really
[67:15] that then we are coming together again
[67:17] not just bring us full circle um Mining
[67:20] and running your own node um going to or
[67:24] uh or starting your own own Meetup um
[67:27] any of those things are different ways
[67:29] of um connecting with other bitcoiners
[67:32] um of uh coming together again in that
[67:35] original sense of religion and uh uh
[67:39] yeah and then if it's something
[67:40] important to you there something that uh
[67:42] is like also on that that value side
[67:45] that meaning side of things like
[67:47] religion and money are both in that that
[67:49] side of the spectrum um then yeah then
[67:52] you can consider Bitcoin a religion
[67:54] according to again I want to be very
[67:55] careful with that definition uh no
[67:57] worship of
[67:58] Satoshi I'm not going to you're free to
[68:01] if you want uh and I'm not going to be
[68:03] worshiping the the coin itself but uh um
[68:06] I guess what I'm trying to say here is
[68:08] worship and Bitcoin do go hand in hand
[68:10] but yeah back to minding though it it
[68:13] doesn't really matter to me that all the
[68:14] big players are I'm just grateful that
[68:16] anybody who wants to mine is mining you
[68:18] really brought it back with a wholesome
[68:21] episode in the full circle moment uh
[68:23] beginning or or or the midddle and end
[68:26] really cool thank you so much uh Jason
