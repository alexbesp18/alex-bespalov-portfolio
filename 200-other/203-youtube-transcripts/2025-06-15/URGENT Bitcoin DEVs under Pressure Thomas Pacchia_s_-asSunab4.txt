[00:00] we see a wh scale attack on open source
[00:02] software developers in Bitcoin happening
[00:05] now they're competing against in nation
[00:07] states people or are able to solve the
[00:09] overall equation of mining economics in
[00:12] different ways which is what makes it
[00:13] one of the most Cutthroat Soul crushing
[00:15] businesses on the planet most mining
[00:18] operations are not in a position where
[00:20] they're able to stack meaningful amounts
[00:22] of Bitcoin was there anything that
[00:24] surprised you from that Haring we need
[00:26] to give Bitcoin a little bit of
[00:28] breathing room give the developers
[00:29] breathing room to innovate and continue
[00:31] to bring better products and services I
[00:33] see if future everybody uses Bitcoin
[00:35] because it is actually the base layer of
[00:36] our financial system we also wanted to
[00:38] provide a real sense of community for
[00:41] bitcoiners did you always wanted to to
[00:43] have a bar is this like something that
[00:46] you always had in mind or was this
[00:47] coming out like randomly gez I guess I
[00:50] guess a mix of of both I've always
[00:52] really enjoyed um specifically like New
[00:55] York City like pubs and taverns we call
[00:58] them dive bars here um and it's also one
[01:01] of the best ways to uh uh to travel is
[01:04] to find something that's not just sort
[01:06] of like a um a magnet for tourists or
[01:09] people that are just passing through if
[01:11] you can find something that is
[01:12] hyperlocal it's uh uh just like that
[01:15] normal Pub Tavern you know bar is um a
[01:20] really great way to get a much better
[01:21] sense of a local culture uh local
[01:23] Cuisine the way that they drink the way
[01:25] that they talk and interact with each
[01:27] other that like Cadence um you know I
[01:30] think a lot of the um a lot of the Guard
[01:33] comes down right especially in in
[01:36] heavily trafficked like touristy areas
[01:38] like if you go you know even to like
[01:40] Rome or Paris I mean these are um like P
[01:44] like uh sort of Premier tourist
[01:47] destinations and you can get one sort of
[01:49] view into a local area that way and New
[01:52] York City is like this as well you're
[01:54] going to get a very very different vibe
[01:55] in a Time Square than you will just go
[01:58] into sort of um a local familyowned
[02:00] neighborhood Tavern um so that's always
[02:03] been of interest but I never had any
[02:05] background in Hospitality um in fact
[02:07] most of the founding team didn't have
[02:09] background in Hospitality my wife and I
[02:11] and a group of friends in covid um you
[02:14] know I think it became
[02:16] painfully uh apparent just how important
[02:19] these places are um a lot of them in New
[02:22] York City were closing um you know these
[02:24] these taverns specifically in New York
[02:26] City are are family run um and when
[02:30] something like covid hits uh combined
[02:32] with inflation and you know rent going
[02:36] through the roof it's really hard to
[02:38] operate a Hospitality business uh in
[02:40] that sort of you know uh uh economic uh
[02:44] environment so this was a passion
[02:46] project in that sense our uh my wife and
[02:48] I lived a couple blocks away from the
[02:50] bar that was previously where pubkey um
[02:53] is now uh so we had been coming to this
[02:56] spot um for for many years and it was
[02:59] you know near and dear to our heart but
[03:01] the other thing that was happening in Co
[03:02] was a lot of bitcoiners uh were leaving
[03:05] New York City for other cities right
[03:07] Austin and Nashville definitely being
[03:09] two of uh the biggest ones Miami as well
[03:13] um so what we saw was a bit of a
[03:15] hollowing out of the Bitcoin Community
[03:17] through covid and we had this idea to
[03:20] create you know a space uh for people
[03:23] that could really cultivate uh and
[03:26] support and help grow that community
[03:28] that was getting uh fair amount of
[03:30] attrition just because of you know what
[03:32] was happening through the pandemic so we
[03:34] started the project in 2021 um and it
[03:37] takes a long time when you're dealing
[03:39] with you know renting a commercial lease
[03:41] in the city uh dealing with um you know
[03:44] acquiring a liquor license getting the
[03:46] approvals all that stuff and then
[03:48] construction and standing up in actual
[03:50] restaurant uh operation is is a
[03:53] tremendous amount of work um so it
[03:55] started in 2021 and we finally opened
[03:58] our doors in October of
[04:00] 2022 and you know we've been we've been
[04:03] fortunate to you know one thing about
[04:05] bitcoiners are they're tremendously
[04:07] loyal and passionate so we've had a lot
[04:09] of help from the community to help fill
[04:11] in some of the blind spots that we had
[04:13] particularly around hospitality and some
[04:15] other elements of what we hope to
[04:17] accomplish here um but it it really is a
[04:20] um an expansive project we're trying to
[04:22] pull in you know obviously the
[04:24] foundation is that that Kitchen and Bar
[04:27] the The Tavern the local community
[04:30] um and I would say about 75 to 80% of
[04:33] our customers are still not bitcoiners
[04:36] but we also wanted to provide uh a real
[04:38] sense of community for bitcoiners and
[04:40] the way that we express that is through
[04:42] our you know weekly Bitcoin programming
[04:45] which is at least once a week usually on
[04:46] Thursdays but now it's at the point
[04:48] where we have at least two or three uh
[04:51] Bitcoin programming events on a weekly
[04:53] basis and almost all of these very few
[04:57] exceptions almost all of them have been
[04:58] free and open to the public look um and
[05:01] we like to capture as much of that as we
[05:03] can you know uh digitally for
[05:04] dissemination on YouTube Spotify things
[05:07] like that um so that people that cannot
[05:09] be in the room are still able to
[05:11] participate in that Community Building
[05:13] um so it started as you know a passion
[05:16] project and it's grown into you know
[05:17] full-fledged business over over you know
[05:20] the last I don't know two years at this
[05:22] point coming up on two
[05:24] years yeah and and I feel like Community
[05:27] is such an important aspect
[05:30] uh just just a quick question like why I
[05:32] I noticed that even from from Austria
[05:35] because uh people made videos about it
[05:38] leaving New York City for Miami for
[05:40] Austin for Nashville like it was all
[05:42] over social media it was something that
[05:44] was known internationally but I never
[05:46] understood like why were people living
[05:49] New York City I think Washington was
[05:51] also like one place people left I feel
[05:53] like but maybe I'm wrong why why New
[05:57] York city was it like taxes was was it
[06:00] policies was it what
[06:02] problems for sure I think that that that
[06:05] the taxes and the policies particularly
[06:08] um uh uh as it pertains to running a
[06:11] Bitcoin business in New York City when
[06:13] you're dealing with the bit license
[06:14] that's definitely a a pretty expensive
[06:17] barrier um but just on like a human
[06:20] level like the cost of live the cost of
[06:22] living in New York City is quite high
[06:25] and one of the reasons why New York City
[06:27] is such a special place is because you
[06:28] have um just an abundance of um
[06:32] experiences opportunities bars and
[06:34] restaurants you know Theater comedy
[06:37] music venues Sports everything so you
[06:40] know covid was a a rather um extreme
[06:44] event that takes a lot of the you know
[06:47] uh reason why people love New York City
[06:50] away if you don't if if you see the the
[06:52] closure of a lot of businesses that
[06:55] provide that amazing diversity of
[06:57] experiences and opportunities then the
[06:59] cost of living becomes a little bit more
[07:01] and more expensive it takes an emotional
[07:03] toll it takes Financial toll on um on
[07:07] individuals it's different if you know
[07:09] young and single and you know uh uh uh
[07:13] you you you're able to sort of navigate
[07:16] that in a slightly different way but as
[07:18] people start to have families I think
[07:19] that those financial pressures become a
[07:22] little bit more um taxing uh and you
[07:26] feel the loss of uh the experience and
[07:29] opport opportunity even more severely in
[07:31] that in that event um covid is is pretty
[07:35] much gone I mean you don't really see
[07:37] people in masks or you know talking
[07:39] about it but I think the business
[07:42] hangover uh is still is still lasting a
[07:45] little bit in certain neighborhoods New
[07:47] York City is mostly back um but there
[07:50] are certain neighborhoods that you can
[07:52] still see a bit of a covid hangover uh
[07:56] lots of people I think that we're going
[07:57] to have um a very very long effect of
[08:01] people wanting to work remotely not go
[08:03] to an office 5 days a week and what that
[08:05] means is you know entire neighborhoods
[08:08] that are really built around you know um
[08:10] office economies like Midtown where you
[08:13] have these gigantic Office Buildings the
[08:15] bars and restaurants there are seeing
[08:16] fewer people that are there during the
[08:18] week um so they're a little bit better
[08:21] and we're seeing people go back to the
[08:23] office Tuesday Wednesday Thursday but
[08:25] Monday and Friday is still a bit
[08:27] negotiable people can work from home
[08:29] they can focus on their family they can
[08:31] you know not have to deal with the daily
[08:33] commute you know three days a week is
[08:35] better than five days a week so the the
[08:38] the commercial ramifications of that
[08:41] societal change are still apparent in
[08:43] certain areas but other areas of menh
[08:45] Hatten are back and we're starting to
[08:46] see a lot more bars restaurants other
[08:49] things um um open up finally but it took
[08:52] it took a fair amount of time yeah and I
[08:55] feel like as you said it before Co
[08:57] showed us so good that it's so important
[09:00] to have Community to have places to hang
[09:02] out and and I mean I also respect
[09:05] bitcoiners that don't want to get talkx
[09:08] at all and they just want to stay
[09:10] isolated and don't want to go anywhere
[09:12] close to like a Bitcoin area and but I
[09:15] feel like if if you kind of can convince
[09:18] yourself to do it like there are so many
[09:20] different ways there's like the orange
[09:21] pill app there's like local Bitcoin
[09:23] meetups there are Bitcoin conferences
[09:25] there are like as pupy Bitcoin barel
[09:28] local restaurants where you can go
[09:29] there's so many different ways to get in
[09:31] touch with bitcoiners and uh especially
[09:34] uh for a community that is uh driven
[09:37] through so many highs and lows uh it it
[09:40] can really help to just engage with with
[09:43] real people in real life and just have
[09:45] conversation at least for me it has a
[09:47] had a big impact like before I met any
[09:50] bitcoiners online um I met any
[09:53] bitcoiners offline it was completely
[09:56] different for me it had a different
[09:58] impact on live I took it really more
[10:00] seriously at the podcast and way more
[10:03] stuff on that but I feel like that's
[10:05] that's really important to have
[10:06] communities or a lot of projects like
[10:08] the PO key thank you um that means a lot
[10:11] and um you know I think that there is a
[10:14] a big difference or there's there's a
[10:16] need that that we try to to fill orange
[10:19] pill app you know um the online
[10:21] communities Twitter it's great to talk
[10:25] to like-minded people um and you know
[10:28] there's also argument ments amongst
[10:30] like-minded people I like to say that
[10:32] like a flame war on Twitter that lasts
[10:34] months could be solved over a beer or
[10:36] two uh at a bar um and it also makes I
[10:40] think bitcoiners as a broader Community
[10:42] much more accessible and relatable um if
[10:45] somebody's interested in Bitcoin um
[10:48] sometimes I think that conferences can
[10:49] be a bad experience because they're
[10:51] quite expensive you have to travel for
[10:53] them you have you know a flight a hotel
[10:56] you go to the conference and the
[10:57] conference can be quite overwhelming if
[10:58] you're if you're you know just getting
[11:00] into Bitcoin I think that some people
[11:03] experience sort of a a painful awareness
[11:05] that they're not invited to you know the
[11:08] dinners or the parties or like the high
[11:10] signal like in crowd events you're sort
[11:13] of thrust into a large Expo um where
[11:17] there's a sea of of booths there's lots
[11:19] of marketing there's talks that a lot of
[11:21] people have can already access right a
[11:23] lot of the the content at conferences
[11:26] sometimes there's announcements but you
[11:29] know the stuff that that that that the
[11:31] conversations that happen on panels and
[11:32] things like that I don't think are are
[11:35] what people are really looking for uh
[11:37] when they're going to their first
[11:38] Bitcoin conference they're looking for
[11:40] community and that that's something
[11:42] entirely different it's it's hard to
[11:43] achieve that sense of community over the
[11:45] course of three days for a newcomer but
[11:48] you know if you have a location like a
[11:50] pubkey or a standing Bitcoin Meetup
[11:52] right even even if it's a monthly Meetup
[11:55] um you're able to actually have that you
[11:58] know human touch that that in-person
[12:00] Dynamic where you can have a real
[12:02] conversation there can be you know
[12:05] vulnerability uh expressed in a in a in
[12:07] a in a slightly you know more confident
[12:10] way where you can actually you know not
[12:11] be afraid of asking dumb questions on
[12:13] Twitter and just getting like dogpiled
[12:15] by people that are saying that's a
[12:16] really dumb question uh over a beer like
[12:20] you're you're almost both sides are
[12:21] forced to uh engage effectively with one
[12:26] another yeah definit definitely and and
[12:29] the conference as you said can be really
[12:31] overwhelming I mean i l it last year for
[12:34] example in prag where I think like 6,000
[12:36] people were there it's way smaller than
[12:38] for example a Nashville conference where
[12:40] I don't know 20 30,000 or like really a
[12:43] lot of more people were there um but
[12:45] still it's a lot of people um what was
[12:49] good for me because I I I saw a lot of
[12:51] energy the energy was was really nice
[12:54] there the talks as you said they're all
[12:56] online anyway so unless you're in the
[12:59] VIP area where there's not shared like
[13:02] online then you can get something and
[13:04] but it's also not nothing to surprise
[13:07] like there's no no really new things the
[13:09] only really good thing is like you have
[13:11] one place where all of the companies are
[13:14] you have a nice overview I really
[13:16] enjoyed going from Booth to boo and
[13:18] talking with the people talking what
[13:19] they're doing like but but maybe that's
[13:21] just me it was I I really like the
[13:23] overview and the seeing all the
[13:25] companies what do they do here and who
[13:28] is here who is not here and stuff like
[13:30] that but maybe that's just the same way
[13:33] I spend most of my time you know going
[13:35] from Booth to booth and seeing familiar
[13:37] faces and and new ones can collect uh
[13:40] whatever whatever marketing swag that
[13:42] they have lots of stickers for my
[13:44] daughters things like that that's that's
[13:46] where I spend my time at conferences
[13:48] yeah also I'm I'm a lot of times in the
[13:50] boo area
[13:52] actually uh I feel like in brag I only
[13:55] yeah I only saw the Michael sailor uh
[13:58] presentation ARR rest I was on the poof
[14:00] for three days straight yeah but um uh
[14:05] coming back to the bar I I saw it only
[14:08] on Twitter I was I'm not wasn't sure is
[14:10] was the auction of the Bitcoin sign in
[14:12] The Bu Key Bar yeah so um the Bitcoin
[14:16] sign guys names Christian lalis um
[14:19] auctioned the original sign um he used
[14:23] we didn't do we didn't facilitate the
[14:24] auction or anything like that he used um
[14:27] scarcity um to facilitate actual auction
[14:30] itself um but on the last day when the
[14:32] countdown was um uh uh was initiated
[14:36] there's this like Hot Zone where the new
[14:39] highest bid you know triggers a five uh
[14:42] a five minute clock for any other
[14:44] competing bids so we had a small group
[14:46] of people and in just like a really uh
[14:49] amazingly special um turn of Fate um you
[14:53] know the the the the gentleman that won
[14:56] the auction is a New Yorker and he came
[14:58] to pubkey and he was live bidding you
[15:00] know from pubkey um which was super
[15:02] exciting it went for um a great number
[15:05] well deserved by Chris I think the the
[15:08] Bitcoin sign is probably the most iconic
[15:10] Bitcoin meme um so that's really a
[15:13] Bitcoin artifact in in many ways um so
[15:16] that was a that was a very special event
[15:18] and that happened you know right after
[15:20] the having um we had a big you know nft
[15:24] NC was in New York so all of the Bitcoin
[15:27] and ordinal activity you know really
[15:30] migrated to pubkey in one one form or
[15:33] another um so April was a pretty intense
[15:36] month for us um I I I was I was happy to
[15:39] see you know the calendar turned to May
[15:42] uh uh eventually because we worked
[15:44] pretty hard here at py to accomplish all
[15:45] these events but even in may we have a
[15:47] ton of stuff as well with pizza day
[15:49] coming up we're we're screening um the
[15:51] New York premiere of um uh my trust in
[15:55] you was broken um and uh we we we always
[15:59] have you know something going on here
[16:01] but that that Bitcoin sign auction was
[16:04] um probably one of the top highlights uh
[16:07] since we've opened the doors and and it
[16:10] was fascinating for me I I just quickly
[16:11] saw it and I was like oh it's
[16:13] interesting and and I took the photo and
[16:16] and reposted it and it was C crazy it
[16:20] was going really uh long and people were
[16:23] having basically three different kinds
[16:25] of opinions the first was like oh it's
[16:27] never worth that keep the Bitcoin the
[16:29] the second was like oh it's an such an
[16:31] iconic thing you have to have it if you
[16:33] have the possibility to buy it then you
[16:34] have to have it the third one like yeah
[16:36] it's free market if obviously it's it's
[16:39] worth that if if someone is willing to
[16:41] pay the price what was your opinion on
[16:43] on on the auction is like I I mean like
[16:46] it's it's probably the most iconic meme
[16:48] like I I shared it myself so many times
[16:51] before the auction before I even knew
[16:54] about the auction so I I feel like when
[16:57] a meme deserves that then it's that Meme
[17:00] uh but like what's your opinion on on on
[17:03] the the the whole debate on is it worth
[17:06] it is it worth is it was the sign worth
[17:10] worth the price that uh it went for uh
[17:13] yeah exact I mean uh there's always this
[17:16] free market answer where like of course
[17:17] when someone pays for it then it's worth
[17:19] it uh but there's always this this
[17:21] long-term them thing like do do you
[17:23] think the sign will outperform Bitcoin
[17:25] in like 50 years assumingly that the
[17:27] sign is still there and it doesn't get
[17:28] burn water or something like that I
[17:31] don't know it'll be interesting to see
[17:33] um if there is a sale how it does in in
[17:36] in Bitcoin terms as opposed to like
[17:38] dollar terms um you know it might not be
[17:41] it'll be look um it's anybody's guess I
[17:46] think it'll be a little bit harder for
[17:47] it to continue to appreciate in Bitcoin
[17:49] terms um uh maybe a little bit easier in
[17:52] dollar terms um but I'm not surprised
[17:56] that it went for the number it did
[17:59] because of how iconic and how special it
[18:01] actually is like it's not the legal pad
[18:04] that was scribbled it's what it's what
[18:05] it represents and what it's what you
[18:08] know um that artifact is so there's
[18:11] always going to be collectors whether
[18:13] it's somebody's you know somebody's
[18:15] buying Babe Ruth's you know uh baseball
[18:18] glove or bat or or something like that
[18:21] um collectors want a sense of um you
[18:25] know ownership over a moment in time and
[18:27] history um and if Bitcoin continues to
[18:30] be a thing uh and does what I you know
[18:33] think it can do what many other
[18:34] bitcoiners think it can do then it's
[18:37] hard to it's hard to imagine an artifact
[18:40] of more importance than that legal pad
[18:43] um the moment in time when you had um uh
[18:48] uh the chair of the Federal Reserve
[18:50] talking about you know whether or not
[18:52] the FED will ever face an audit Bitcoin
[18:54] on the precipice of a major major run um
[18:58] it it was really coming into its own and
[19:01] I think a lot of what was happening in
[19:03] the global financial markets really sort
[19:06] of um was starting to highlight
[19:08] bitcoin's importance and all of that um
[19:11] so I'm kind of hardpressed to think of
[19:13] other Bitcoin artifacts maybe maybe the
[19:15] um um uh the newspaper that you know
[19:19] Satoshi quoted Chancellor on the brink
[19:22] um there are a lot of copies of that
[19:23] there's only one of the um the sign
[19:25] itself maybe the cassious coins um you
[19:29] know but this is this is definitely up
[19:31] there and if you look at like the the
[19:34] importance and the global reach and the
[19:35] value of the Bitcoin Network I think
[19:37] collectors are always going to look to
[19:40] you know these tangible artifacts of uh
[19:42] historical import to um to Value um but
[19:48] again I think it'll be really
[19:49] interesting to see how um how it's
[19:52] valued in the future uh in Bitcoin terms
[19:55] and in dollar terms yeah I mean this is
[19:57] kind of the the shift we we have to make
[20:00] I mean I always kind of try to do it uh
[20:04] and think of like when I start to
[20:08] purchase something bigger or start to
[20:10] think of like oh is it a good investment
[20:12] or is it good that I can get something
[20:14] out of it um when you think in dollars
[20:17] it's always kind of a good decision like
[20:19] not a lot of things are worse than the
[20:22] dollars of course there are things that
[20:24] dollars out of Fe currencies and stuff
[20:25] like that but uh there are not like for
[20:28] example houses a house will always
[20:30] appreciate in dollar terms but I think
[20:33] it will always depreciate uh in in in
[20:35] Bitcoin terms because Bitcoin is just a
[20:37] way better form of storing Financial
[20:39] energy over long term and you saw it
[20:41] over the last 10 years and I think you
[20:42] will see it in the next 10 years uh but
[20:45] in toer terms of course it goes up
[20:47] because yeah if you print so much money
[20:49] it's it's kind of kind of there's
[20:51] there's a really interesting
[20:52] psychological component to that um if
[20:55] you think about the Silk Road um bags of
[20:57] drugs yielded a fair amount of Bitcoin
[21:00] right in in notional Bitcoin terms that
[21:02] like you know they're not worth that at
[21:04] all anymore um and maybe if Christian
[21:07] had sold the Bitcoin sign um years
[21:10] earlier depending on what the market was
[21:12] doing that might have yielded more
[21:13] Bitcoin um for the transaction um so I
[21:17] wonder if we should all be selling
[21:18] everything for Bitcoin now uh or in
[21:21] dollar terms and converting it
[21:23] immediately to capture as much Bitcoin
[21:25] as possible um because I think that
[21:27] there is a very uh
[21:29] plausible scenario where that Bitcoin
[21:31] sign is not going for the same amount of
[21:32] notional Bitcoin in the near future for
[21:35] the next sale or maybe this collector is
[21:37] going to hold on to it forever we don't
[21:38] we don't we don't know what's what um uh
[21:41] what he values uh in terms of ownership
[21:44] of that artifact going
[21:46] forward might be that he just like
[21:48] really likes that moment and he want to
[21:50] just us to own that moment and take it
[21:52] with him forever like or his bathroom or
[21:55] something so he can see it every day
[21:59] definitely but let's get into my actual
[22:01] questions that I had for
[22:03] you um uh as you are involved a lot of
[22:07] of Bitcoin mining um and I never covered
[22:09] that topic as much as I should cover it
[22:13] um Bitcoin mining is evolving I feel
[22:15] like when you come to the old old days
[22:18] where you can mine with a bit with a
[22:20] computer uh then graphic cards then we
[22:22] with the A6 now and uh it becomes more
[22:25] more like a specialized business I feel
[22:27] like um is is there is there like when
[22:29] we look at the long run of Bitcoin
[22:32] mining and like the game theory beh
[22:34] behind Bitcoin mining um is there any um
[22:38] threats to it where it gets too
[22:40] centralized I mean we saw it 2017 that
[22:43] the Bitcoin miners are not like in
[22:45] control like we know that uh the Bitcoin
[22:49] miners just when you can concentrate
[22:50] your Bitcoin minus it's not as as uh
[22:54] yeah as a big of a threat but is is it a
[22:58] problem that Bitcoin manage is kind of a
[23:00] threat and can like small products like
[23:03] a Bitcoin heater or like having Bitcoin
[23:06] minor connect to your solar roof and
[23:08] will it be decentralized in the future
[23:10] is that do you think of of that on this
[23:12] like how do you see it evolving in the
[23:14] next like 50 years yeah I think there
[23:17] will be an EB and flow um to sort of uh
[23:21] large scale um you know public miners
[23:25] with these massive data centers um there
[23:28] is interesting dynamic between these
[23:29] public miners who are are mining for uh
[23:32] increasing shareholder value always
[23:35] denominated in local currency right they
[23:37] they want to see the dollar value of
[23:39] these of these um companies and
[23:41] organizations go up um these companies
[23:44] and organizations are competing against
[23:46] hobbyists they're competing against in
[23:48] nation states um people in other or
[23:52] anywhere in the world that have you know
[23:54] much cheaper electricity or able to
[23:56] steal electricity or or um are able to
[23:59] solve uh the overall equation of of
[24:02] mining economics in different ways which
[24:05] is what makes it one of the most
[24:06] Cutthroat Soul crushing businesses on
[24:08] the planet and I think that there will
[24:10] always be an EB and flow between
[24:13] centralization and
[24:14] decentralization I I'm not terribly
[24:16] concerned about that because I I
[24:18] actually think that the incentives are
[24:20] are really elegantly balanced um it's
[24:23] it's a it's a really beautiful protocol
[24:24] the way that it's um um um designed I
[24:28] think that the um concern when we talk
[24:31] about centralization and Mining is it
[24:33] for me is is more at the pool level than
[24:35] at individual miners because individual
[24:38] miners can effectively you know set up
[24:41] some rakes if they have access to some
[24:43] as6 they have electricity not all miners
[24:46] mine for uh US dollar profits some are
[24:50] mining just to capture an amount of
[24:52] Bitcoin some are mining to get access to
[24:56] a Global Financial Network that is not
[24:58] sort of censored and controlled in the
[25:00] same way that let's say the Swift
[25:01] Network or the correspondent banking
[25:03] network is and I think that that will
[25:05] always always exist in some capacity but
[25:08] when we look at um mining pools which
[25:10] are effectively um a a swap product uh
[25:15] between the pool and an individual minor
[25:17] trading variant and smoothing out sort
[25:20] of um the uh the revenue streams uh
[25:23] that's where we could see uh a little
[25:26] bit of a concern uh around around
[25:29] whether it's a regulatory threat or um a
[25:32] threat that comes from uh a particular
[25:34] company running a large pool themselves
[25:37] um to to potentially um manipulate
[25:39] things or or or get away from um uh
[25:42] Bitcoin the way it it it ought to
[25:44] operate um but in terms of largescale
[25:48] miners uh one of the best examples that
[25:51] we had was the the capacity in China
[25:54] just after covid was tremendous and then
[25:57] there's the Chinese band
[25:59] um a lot of that equipment you know uh
[26:01] goes to other jurisdictions we saw a lot
[26:03] of it go to Texas elsewhere in the
[26:05] United States South America um a lot of
[26:08] it you know over into uh Kazakhstan
[26:11] usbekistan
[26:12] um it'll always sort of find its level
[26:16] uh and I think miners will always find
[26:18] uh the most uh favorable uh conditions
[26:22] not just from a power uh price
[26:25] perspective but also you know other
[26:27] things that are in the mix terms of you
[26:29] know regulatory climate um you know
[26:31] operating concerns things like that um
[26:34] now there's a lot of concentration in
[26:36] Texas in the US um but what we've seen
[26:39] in China since is I think a lot of hash
[26:43] rate has been plugged back in there it's
[26:44] hard to tell exactly how much but um you
[26:47] get these sort of cockroach uh
[26:50] operations that are able to pop back up
[26:53] uh even in places where there is um I
[26:56] would say more um regulatory hostility
[27:00] um uh than elsewhere or than previously
[27:02] before so it's always evolving and I
[27:04] think that you know just after the
[27:06] having we're going to see some of that
[27:09] some of those catalysts a little bit
[27:11] more um you know there is always an
[27:14] inventory flush there was always pain as
[27:17] the supply side economics change even
[27:20] though we know about it I I I'm not um
[27:23] uh totally um subscribe to efficient
[27:26] market hypothesis particularly in the
[27:28] mining uh industry um so I think a lot
[27:32] of the ramifications of the having are
[27:33] still yet to play out that historically
[27:36] has taken you know a couple of quarters
[27:39] um to actually see uh consolidation
[27:42] occur in the in the in the mining
[27:44] industry um but I think you know we'll
[27:47] we'll continue to see um an ebb and flow
[27:51] from centralization to decentralization
[27:53] on the miner level um a little bit more
[27:55] of a concern around the uh mining pool
[27:57] level
[27:59] what do you mean with uh the
[28:01] ramification of the Bitcoin Haring like
[28:05] what what what does the Bitcoin Haring
[28:07] has as an impact after after it
[28:10] happened yeah so you know miners uh all
[28:13] miners are operating in local currency
[28:15] to buy equipment to buy electricity to
[28:18] pay for labor to maintain data centers
[28:20] all of that stuff so everything on the
[28:22] cost side for miners is denominated in
[28:24] the local currency let's just say
[28:26] dollars here in the US um the revenue
[28:28] side of the equation is denominated in
[28:30] Bitcoin they receive Bitcoin for the you
[28:33] know hash rate production they're able
[28:34] to put out there um so there's always uh
[28:38] an inherent imbalance that needs to be
[28:40] dealt with for any mining operation
[28:43] embedded in hash rate you have a lot of
[28:44] volatility risks you have the market
[28:46] price of Bitcoin um you have difficulty
[28:49] adjustments you have variance which we
[28:51] talked about a little bit earlier you
[28:52] have you know transaction fee volatility
[28:55] right now um when you have uh sort of
[28:59] difficulty or having right there's less
[29:01] Bitcoin that all miners are competing
[29:03] for so there's Le less available Revenue
[29:06] we haven't seen the price the market
[29:08] price of Bitcoin double to offset that
[29:12] um we saw a spike in transaction fees
[29:14] which was very short-lived and you know
[29:16] may not be sustainable enough to totally
[29:18] offset that so if a mining operation has
[29:21] a business where it says this is my you
[29:23] know cost side of the equation and I I'm
[29:26] I'm sustainable at these levels but then
[29:28] on the revenue side that gets slashed by
[29:31] 50% there is a very difficult
[29:34] recalibration I would say for for most
[29:36] minors there are some miners that are
[29:37] large enough um they were able to build
[29:41] um you know a robust enough um uh uh
[29:44] treasury like War chess to deal with
[29:46] this and to continue to expand um but I
[29:48] think that that calibration that
[29:50] market-wide uh uh recalibration is is
[29:53] still playing out so it's interesting in
[29:55] mind because uh they they might Bitcoin
[29:58] and they always have the they also have
[30:00] the possibility basically to also have
[30:02] uh to stack more Bitcoin in the short
[30:05] term when they think it's like a bare
[30:07] Market they like profit from that if
[30:10] there's a bull market I mean I have like
[30:12] I don't operate a m I have no clue about
[30:14] mining on a a detail level I was just
[30:16] like now thinking uh is is there are
[30:18] some this those those strategies where
[30:20] like okay if the price seems low
[30:23] compared to the usual foure cycle where
[30:26] you stack a little bit more and then
[30:28] uh when when there's a bull market
[30:30] coming then you try to like prepare for
[30:32] the upcoming bare Market I guess this is
[30:35] like usual Financial stuff like as as
[30:37] all all all companies even outside of
[30:39] Bitcoin mining too yeah look that's a
[30:42] great question so there that that's like
[30:44] on the treasury management side of
[30:46] things let let's assume they they're
[30:47] able to cover all their costs um and now
[30:51] they're sitting with an amount of
[30:52] Bitcoin um what miners are also uh
[30:56] painfully aware of most miners are
[30:58] painfully aware of if um if a mining
[31:01] operation's hash rate production is not
[31:04] growing at the rate the overall network
[31:07] is growing they're effectively being
[31:09] diluted so they have to grow at or above
[31:12] the rate of change for cumulative hash
[31:15] rate um uh uh for the entire network to
[31:19] protect against solution and also to
[31:21] become more and more competitive to
[31:22] capture more of that that um that share
[31:25] of Bitcoin that's being released if
[31:27] they're if they're in that deluded state
[31:30] if they are not growing at the same rate
[31:32] of you know the the overall Network
[31:34] growth they're being diluted and that's
[31:36] a losing situation they can do it for a
[31:39] period of time there are ways to deal
[31:41] with it uh through you know treasury
[31:43] management hedging and stuff like that
[31:45] but then you're starting to get into
[31:46] sophisticated Financial products and not
[31:48] everybody has that capabilities in house
[31:51] and it it doesn't always offset some of
[31:53] the risks um because that that ends up
[31:56] being a very very complicated
[31:59] complicated way to to approach things so
[32:02] they capture a certain amount of Bitcoin
[32:04] they're able to pay all their costs
[32:06] which are you know dollar denominated
[32:08] whatever they're left with a certain
[32:10] amount of Bitcoin then they effectively
[32:11] have to decide all right we want to keep
[32:13] as much Bitcoin as possible but we do
[32:14] have to keep growing so it's a
[32:16] reinvestment in the operation to protect
[32:18] against solution um and then you know
[32:21] when they when they you know set that
[32:23] let's say you know costs are 50% and we
[32:26] we need to grow at another 20 % so let's
[32:28] just say there's 30% profit you know do
[32:32] we hold on to that in Bitcoin uh and
[32:35] hope that we see a part of the cycle
[32:36] where that is going to appreciate um or
[32:40] do we want to lock this in uh in US
[32:43] dollars to pay in case we have a bad
[32:44] month or you know um something at the
[32:47] facility breaks down and we need more
[32:49] more investment to fix things um taxes
[32:53] whatever uh can pop up um you know some
[32:56] mining operations just like any other
[32:58] company if treasury management catches
[33:01] you at the wrong time uh let's say let's
[33:04] say Bitcoin is is down 40% in that
[33:07] period and you have a large tax bill you
[33:08] weren't expecting where there's a fire
[33:10] at the data center that you need to
[33:12] repair um or or or something like that
[33:14] happens it becomes a very very delicate
[33:16] dance which is why I think you know most
[33:19] mining operations are not in a position
[33:23] where they're able to stack meaningful
[33:25] amounts of Bitcoin um you know it would
[33:28] be nice to see them all but I think that
[33:30] they are natural forced sellers for the
[33:33] vast majority of Bitcoin that they mine
[33:35] um and that's probably going to continue
[33:38] and there are edge cases right so like a
[33:40] um a home Miner a hobbyist they say this
[33:43] is just the cost of of my hobby I'll pay
[33:47] electricity I'll pay for new equipment I
[33:50] don't care if I'm being diluted it's
[33:51] nice to get Bitcoin those hobbyists are
[33:55] definitely more likely
[33:58] um to be stacking the Bitcoin that they
[34:00] receive um and it's also being received
[34:03] in a way uh outside of exchanges in a in
[34:06] a in a no kyc fashion so you know some
[34:09] would say that there is more value
[34:11] attached to that um I think that there
[34:13] is you know a counterargument to that um
[34:15] but if people believe that that has
[34:17] value it has value same as you know a
[34:19] legal notepad that somebody scribble buy
[34:21] Bitcoin on but um yeah there are a lot
[34:24] of there are a lot of Dynamics bit coin
[34:26] mining is is definitely one of the most
[34:28] complicated and fascinating brutal
[34:31] Industries on the planet if you are
[34:33] listening to this podcast you might be
[34:35] wondering what is actually the setup
[34:37] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[34:40] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[34:42] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[34:44] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[34:46] right way let's focus on the first thing
[34:48] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[34:51] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[34:53] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[34:55] an exchange that has an own token or
[34:57] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[34:59] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[35:02] for me the best partner for that and now
[35:06] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[35:08] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[35:10] a self custody solution where you
[35:13] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[35:16] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[35:19] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[35:22] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[35:24] fras and you are better than 95 % of all
[35:28] Bitcoin holders if you have more than a
[35:31] th000 EUR in Bitcoin it's a absolutely
[35:33] must have one last thing before we get
[35:36] back to the video I'm really passionate
[35:38] about meeting other bitcoiners and
[35:40] there's an amazing opportunity in middle
[35:42] of Europe in June the Bitcoin BR
[35:45] conference it's the best and biggest
[35:48] Bitcoin only conference in whole of
[35:51] Europe for all Americans please visit
[35:53] Europe and visit this place in June for
[35:56] all europees it's a must go go anyways
[35:58] you're so close to the Bitcoin PR
[36:00] conference you basically have to come I
[36:02] will do interviews there and I would
[36:04] love to meet you all there use code
[36:07] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[36:10] discounts and use the links down in the
[36:12] description what what also is
[36:14] fascinating for me in the Bitcoin uh
[36:16] mining hash rate while while they
[36:19] because when I came into Bitcoin my
[36:21] conclusion was like oh the hash rate is
[36:23] uh depending on the Bitcoin price but it
[36:26] seems like it's not uh because the
[36:29] mining hash rate has been up up up it's
[36:32] alltime high even when the Bitcoin price
[36:34] was was down like 50 60% of the alltime
[36:37] high uh and the hash rate kept hitting
[36:40] alltime highs uh is that because as you
[36:43] described that the miners to not be
[36:47] deluded has to keep up with the growing
[36:49] network if everyone tries always to grow
[36:52] and new people come in and new companies
[36:54] come in and try also to mine because
[36:56] it's a new exciting uh um business and
[36:59] industry to be in uh is that the the
[37:02] sole reason why it keeps growing even
[37:04] though the price like is not keeping up
[37:06] sometimes this is a this is this is an
[37:08] old question that I don't think anybody
[37:10] has really like zeroed in on a final
[37:12] answer for it's whether like price does
[37:14] price follow hash rate or does hash rate
[37:16] follow price um and I think it depends
[37:19] in certain circumstances you can make
[37:21] the argument one way in circumstances
[37:24] you can make it the other way um you
[37:26] have a lot of like energy companies that
[37:28] see an Arbitrage through mining Bitcoin
[37:31] um if you have enough people that uh
[37:34] observe some of the elegant solutions
[37:37] that um a mining company is able to um
[37:41] uh take advantage of then more likely
[37:44] than not you're going to have some
[37:45] people in that organization around that
[37:47] organization see value in Bitcoin itself
[37:50] and they're going to want to have some
[37:51] they're going to soak up more Supply um
[37:54] there's a bit of a dance between the the
[37:56] the two um and it really depends on when
[37:59] uh in terms of the the relationship
[38:01] between um price and hash rate and how
[38:03] that progresses um L I think I think a
[38:07] lot of it right now has been sort of uh
[38:10] mostly driven by any energy uh Arbitrage
[38:15] opportunities um and uh finding business
[38:19] models that work in certain locations
[38:21] and then other people recognizing that
[38:23] and say like hey I have a similar
[38:25] situation and I can buy some of these
[38:27] rigs set up a data center um and you
[38:30] know make money off of let's say a
[38:32] wasted or stranded energy asset or an
[38:35] energy asset that's heavily subsidized
[38:38] by the government um there are many such
[38:40] cases there's there's a lot of um of
[38:43] different ways to look at
[38:44] it absolutely and uh last questions on
[38:48] the Bitcoin mining was there anything
[38:50] that surprised you from that having
[38:53] anything that was unnatural uh that was
[38:56] maybe not in in previous uh hings I
[38:59] think the the one thing that I noticed
[39:01] that we hit the all-time high before the
[39:03] Haring but it's just us dollar price
[39:05] action that I think never happened
[39:07] before was there anything that surprised
[39:09] you with this Haring or was it uh pretty
[39:12] much like all the other
[39:13] hings yeah so the all-time high uh I
[39:16] think that we can say with decent
[39:18] confidence that had to do with the ETFs
[39:20] being approved in January um and large
[39:24] large uh financial institutions offering
[39:26] products um and opening up a whole new
[39:29] cohort of institutional investors
[39:31] Pension funds endowments you know
[39:33] Sovereign wealth funds we're able to get
[39:36] access to bitcoin uh bitcoin's price
[39:40] volatility uh and exposure that way has
[39:42] driven a lot of
[39:44] demand um you know post having I mean it
[39:48] went off the way it was supposed
[39:50] to um you know the blocks confirmed and
[39:53] all that um there was a tremendous
[39:55] amount of activity in the first block
[39:57] and then a couple of the subsequent ones
[39:59] you know I'm not the biggest fan of
[40:02] ordinal for ordinal sake and a lot of
[40:04] this you know brc2 and Rune activity I
[40:07] did think it was going to be a little
[40:08] bit more sustained than it was it really
[40:10] sort of shot up to you know
[40:12] catastrophically high levels
[40:14] particularly that first block was like
[40:16] 40 Bitcoin of transaction fees or
[40:18] something like that um uh in that range
[40:22] uh and then it really fell off a cliff
[40:24] um and it looks like runes are really
[40:25] struggling to to gather momentum and
[40:27] confidence to get back to where they
[40:29] were just leading up to the having maybe
[40:32] it comes back I don't think anything
[40:33] ever dies now GameStop and AMC are doing
[40:36] super well again uh so I'm sure runes
[40:38] will have another crack at it um but um
[40:42] I guess you know the ETF an all-time
[40:45] high wasn't as much of a Sur of a
[40:47] surprise you had lots of very strong
[40:49] narratives going to the having um and
[40:52] then if you switch to just transaction
[40:54] fee um uh volatility
[40:57] that was not as much of a surprise
[41:00] because you know runes were definitely
[41:02] something hyped going into it uh if
[41:04] anything I'm surprised that that um uh
[41:07] fell off as quickly and dramatically as
[41:09] it did and we haven't seen transaction
[41:11] fees come come come back to it ordinals
[41:14] really like if you just look at you know
[41:17] transaction fees ordinals have really
[41:19] produced like two Eiffel
[41:21] Towers uh in in that chart there was
[41:23] like the initial you know frenzy uh
[41:26] around this time last year um when
[41:30] ordinals you know first you know broke
[41:31] onto the scene and then uh right around
[41:34] the having again uh uh around runes but
[41:38] outside of that there hasn't been really
[41:41] sustained um organic growth uh uh at
[41:45] least reflected in the transaction fee
[41:48] Market maybe that maybe you could make
[41:50] the argument that you know that growth
[41:51] is happening elsewhere and you have to
[41:53] look at it uh a little bit differently
[41:55] but just by going by Cold Hard on on
[41:57] chain metrics um you know that the the
[42:00] fall off was a bit of a surprise to me
[42:03] yeah definitely it's it's fascinating
[42:05] the D Dynamics on on on the the
[42:08] blockchain on on the Bitcoin blockchain
[42:11] um you you also sent me before for the
[42:14] preparation a little bit about yourself
[42:16] and you were saying like you're a
[42:17] recovering lawyer uh which I found
[42:20] interesting and funny um do you think
[42:23] our legal system in general is is a fair
[42:26] one do you do feel like it's it's it's
[42:29] uh doing what it is supposed to
[42:32] do um that's a that that's a hard
[42:36] question um is it fair no I don't think
[42:39] it's I don't think it's fair um and I
[42:41] think it's really dependent on what
[42:43] sector you look at I think um at least
[42:47] in the US uh it's certainly the one that
[42:50] we have and it's evolved this way over
[42:52] time for a reason it definitely benefits
[42:56] um I would say corporations large
[42:58] corporations more than it does you know
[43:00] entrepreneurs startups small small
[43:02] business owners things like that um if
[43:04] you look at uh um specific segments of
[43:09] the legal system um one of the one of
[43:12] the crowning achievements in the
[43:14] American legal system was bankruptcy law
[43:17] particularly in the 70s 80s 90s um and
[43:20] that was meant to provide structure for
[43:23] orderly liquidation of failed companies
[43:26] to the benefit of creditor s and also to
[43:28] the benefit of uh those going through
[43:29] bankruptcy by slowing things down taking
[43:32] a snapshot and um having a process in
[43:35] place for an orderly liquidation or
[43:37] restructuring that was a that was a
[43:39] great system which I think has largely
[43:42] um been bastardized in the last couple
[43:44] of um decades going back to the Leman
[43:47] crisis and uh ge bailouts and things
[43:50] like that um corporate interests and and
[43:52] and shareholder interests and really you
[43:55] know uh the the folks that are um uh uh
[44:00] really driving the process itself the
[44:03] lawyers the accountants the Consultants
[44:05] are becoming you know fantastically
[44:07] wealthy through this process um and I I
[44:10] pick on that one because of FTX right so
[44:13] FTX um creditors people uh who had funds
[44:17] at FTX and and and lost those funds um I
[44:22] I don't know if these are the exact
[44:23] figures I believe it's in the range of
[44:25] like 1.3 billion but legal fees alone
[44:28] have already outstripped that so when
[44:30] you see um when you see that like
[44:33] creditors are going to be made whole
[44:36] they're not like the dollar value they
[44:38] lost out on the crypto that they held a
[44:40] lot of that crypto if it's Bitcoin and
[44:42] salana uh definitely not ethereum that's
[44:44] not really doing anything but Bitcoin
[44:46] and salana have done quite well and
[44:48] they're not seeing that price increase
[44:49] they got frozen in time and they are
[44:52] going to be you know made whole on that
[44:54] snapshot but that that really is not
[44:57] reflective of the whole situation so I
[44:59] think you know just using that as an
[45:02] example and then if we look at a lot of
[45:03] the uh approach elsewhere um you know I
[45:08] believe the tornado uh developers uh
[45:11] were convicted earlier this morning um
[45:14] we see you know a whol scale attack on
[45:16] open- Source software developers you
[45:19] know in Bitcoin and throughout the
[45:20] broader crypto space happening now um
[45:24] this is special special interests that
[45:25] are driving a lot of these really harsh
[45:28] regulatory um uh impediments to the
[45:32] industry um so I mean I'm I'm I'm
[45:34] certainly biased in in in some regard um
[45:38] but I don't think it's I don't think
[45:39] it's a fair system I think it's
[45:41] definitely got away from some of the
[45:43] like core tenants of um of what the
[45:46] legal system is supposed to provide you
[45:48] know citizens there's a question that I
[45:50] like it it comes up a lot of the times
[45:52] in in in uh my podcast because I think a
[45:55] lot about it how the world of Politics
[45:59] the world of the legal system the world
[46:01] of of yeah our world in general actually
[46:04] evolves when this Bitcoin thing as we
[46:08] all believe will actually work out and
[46:10] it will be like a base layer monetary
[46:13] system I mean all bitcoiners have kind
[46:15] of like different versions of how this
[46:17] can look and there are bitcoiners on my
[46:21] podcast show that says like the US
[46:22] Dollars and fear system will always be
[46:24] be then there are bitcoins on there that
[46:27] uh think that in the next three years
[46:29] the Fiat system the complete fat system
[46:30] will die I think both a little bit
[46:33] extremist but there there's like from
[46:35] from various ranges uh in in the broader
[46:38] sense I also feel like there's a current
[46:40] war on freedom privacy open source all
[46:43] those those things that are kind of
[46:44] interrelated to each other um how how
[46:48] how do you see that like is like first
[46:50] of all probably you agree with me that
[46:52] there's like war going on against
[46:54] Freedom privacy in open source um and
[46:57] then when a growing Bitcoin economy
[46:59] comes in there where a lot of bitcoiners
[47:02] actually
[47:03] um fight for those freedom and privacy
[47:07] uh rights a lot and they also value that
[47:10] a lot and I feel like also bitcoiners
[47:12] that come in Bitcoin often gets Orange
[47:15] buil in a privacy sense for example I
[47:17] was before absolutely not concerned
[47:20] about it now I'm getting more and more
[47:22] concerned about it uh and and in that
[47:24] sense like how do you see this playing
[47:26] out in the long run when Bitcoin this
[47:29] this mindset of Bitcoin but also the
[47:31] asset Bitcoin uh gets more and more
[47:34] involved in the
[47:35] world um you
[47:37] know uh freedoms and privacy are are
[47:41] largely uh a myth at this point I think
[47:44] that there's been so much of um of a
[47:47] Crackdown on that for so long I I feel
[47:49] like open source software is a tool to
[47:52] reclaim some of those it's it's it's one
[47:54] it's one weapon that um is under attack
[47:56] now for obvious reasons um but you know
[47:59] I think that we lost so much ground in
[48:02] terms of you know self- sovereignty as
[48:05] individuals um and you know right to
[48:08] privacy as individuals and you know I
[48:10] say this as an American through an
[48:12] American perspective it's very different
[48:13] for people you know in other parts of
[48:15] the world um um but you know I think
[48:19] that there has been a concered effort to
[48:22] erode a lot of those um those uh rights
[48:26] that Americans uh probably take for
[48:28] granted over the last couple of decades
[48:30] maybe you know longer than you know 911
[48:34] certainly you know into the 90s and 80s
[48:36] as well um it's going to be very
[48:38] difficult to get it back the cool thing
[48:39] about open source software is uh once
[48:42] it's out there it's out there um and you
[48:45] know these tools are becoming you know
[48:47] stronger in a way um to the point where
[48:50] they have to make examples of
[48:51] individuals that develop it um but you
[48:54] know with the tools there's always
[48:56] another wave of innovators and and
[48:59] people who want to you know um uh
[49:01] continue to push back at some of the
[49:03] erosion of these rights I think we're
[49:06] going to see in the next you know
[49:09] however many years it's going to be a
[49:10] cat and mouse game um where there will
[49:13] be you know leaps forward for privacy
[49:16] preserving Technologies and then you
[49:18] know leaps forward for you know
[49:20] government enforcement and surveillance
[49:22] to um counteract some of those um
[49:26] privacy PR preserving mechanisms um it's
[49:29] an unfortunate situation I think it's
[49:31] through education and through
[49:33] highlighting the benefits of uh a
[49:36] Financial Freedom uh and um Financial
[49:39] self- sovereignty and privacy rights um
[49:42] that were able to shine a little bit of
[49:43] a light because I think most Americans
[49:45] most most people would agree that that's
[49:47] a that that's something that you know
[49:49] ought to be um protected we do we do a
[49:52] lot of work at pubkey with the human
[49:54] rights Foundation focusing on a lot of
[49:56] the inititive
[49:57] uh in this area um and one of my
[49:59] favorite ones to point to is an activist
[50:02] her name is um Royal Mao and she us
[50:04] she's been using Bitcoin since
[50:07] 2012 um to fund uh women's education in
[50:11] Afghanistan so in Afghanistan women are
[50:13] not allowed to have their own bank
[50:15] accounts they have um heavily restricted
[50:17] access to their own you know finances
[50:20] they have to go through um a patriarch
[50:22] or you know uh another uh uh male in
[50:25] their life um to access these things um
[50:28] but Bitcoin provides uh um uh a Lifeboat
[50:34] really for people to have some
[50:36] sovereignty uh and take matters into
[50:38] their into their own hands so if you
[50:40] explain to people uh uh at least in
[50:44] America if you're explaining Bitcoin
[50:45] through the lens of Elizabeth Warren who
[50:47] was saying this is for you know sex
[50:49] trafficking and money launderers and
[50:51] drug dealers you know that's something
[50:54] that may resonate with her base but if
[50:57] you were to explain that exact same
[50:58] story about funding you know uh girls
[51:01] education in Afghanistan and why this is
[51:03] an important um uh tool that enables and
[51:07] facilitates that then the whole concept
[51:10] of you know money laundering becomes
[51:12] quite um complicated but also uh uh is a
[51:17] little bit more illuminated in some
[51:19] ways I feel like uh the Western World
[51:22] especially the elites and like even to a
[51:25] certain extent the middle class is
[51:28] sometimes too arrogant to understand uh
[51:30] Bitcoin they they live in a in a in a in
[51:33] a western World bubble uh where they
[51:36] don't see the use cases like it it
[51:39] really like gives me angry in my heart
[51:42] when when I get like a comment on
[51:43] YouTube or X or something like that but
[51:46] it's like oh but what's the use case of
[51:48] Bitcoin I'm like open your eyes
[51:51] please like just just look a little bit
[51:54] outside of your Twitter
[51:57] uh bubble and and see where actually
[51:59] people are struggling and what what what
[52:00] Bitcoin actually can do for for the
[52:02] world and and for uh people that don't
[52:05] have uh with with the birth uh a bank
[52:08] account and access to credit and all the
[52:10] financial instruments that because Fe I
[52:13] me this is quite known with all the
[52:15] listeners here but the closer you are to
[52:17] the money printer the the better it is
[52:20] for you and when someone is really far
[52:22] off uh they they they see the the use
[52:25] case of Bitcoin and some someone is
[52:27] really close to the money printer of
[52:28] course they don't see the use case of
[52:30] Bitcoin that much or they don't want to
[52:32] see the use case of Bitcoin in cases of
[52:35] of of like Jamie Dar and and people like
[52:37] that yeah look I mean you know in the
[52:40] case of Jamie Darman I think that he
[52:41] does see it and he does get it he's just
[52:43] you know biased in a different way for
[52:46] for you know his business is about you
[52:48] know regulatory Moes and control and
[52:50] oversight surveillance things like that
[52:52] um so that makes sense it's the people
[52:54] it's the people that you know would
[52:57] would get it if they put in the time and
[52:59] the effort and it's really difficult to
[53:01] give them a book on bitcoin show them a
[53:03] podcast come to the conference and not
[53:06] to you know make this about um pubkey
[53:08] but one of the things that we try to do
[53:10] we we have a joke it's like giving a dog
[53:13] a medicine you you hide the pill in you
[53:15] hide the pill in like peanut butter or
[53:17] cheese or something like that if they're
[53:18] not going to take the medicine on their
[53:19] own um you got to kind of put the orange
[53:22] pill in peanut butter or beer or
[53:24] something uh and hopefully people can
[53:26] start to see through repetition um it
[53:29] doesn't happen at once it's not one
[53:31] conversation it's not one book in most
[53:33] cases because most people don't want to
[53:35] hear you know something that they
[53:37] something that makes them uncomfortable
[53:39] and like Bitcoin is not is not a
[53:41] comfortable thing it opens up uh your
[53:44] eyes to lots of um injustices in the
[53:47] world that have been happening over the
[53:49] course of centuries and are like
[53:52] systemic uh and deeply entrenched um and
[53:55] a lot of people just don't want to fight
[53:56]  think about that um you know
[53:58] it's that character in The Matrix where
[54:00] just wants the fake stake um and that
[54:04] that has to be something that I think
[54:05] bitcoiners are comfortable with like
[54:07] understanding that Bitcoin is not for
[54:09] everybody it's for anyone uh is a really
[54:12] important thing because not not
[54:14] everybody is going to be able to get
[54:16] there um uh at least not in our lifetime
[54:19] I I think I mean it's I feel like um I
[54:24] always make the comparison with the
[54:26] dcpip protocol where everybody uses the
[54:29] dcpip protocol in some sense uh but how
[54:33] many people can actually understand it
[54:35] like how many people can actually uh in
[54:38] in in in a good way explain what it does
[54:41] uh and and and why it's important and
[54:44] what's the history of it and I feel like
[54:45] with with Bitcoin it will be a similar
[54:48] route I mean far off in the future but
[54:51] uh I see if future where everybody uses
[54:54] Bitcoin because it is actually the base
[54:55] layer of off Financial system uh and
[54:58] then there is layer two layer three
[54:59] layer whatever uh and there like a lot
[55:02] of questions on how this scaling goes
[55:04] and and how exactly this this will point
[55:07] out but it's somehow we will do it I
[55:09] feel like um and people will use it
[55:12] without even knowing it uh and it will
[55:15] be normal like sending an email and
[55:17] there also like uh people that ask me oh
[55:20] you're doing a daily Bitcoin podcast and
[55:22] I have now 123 like one two three
[55:25] today's episode actually actually uh and
[55:28] they ask me like oh how how long will
[55:30] you do it and I'm like as long as it is
[55:32] interesting like Bitcoin will be
[55:34] probably interesting for the next like
[55:36] five 10 20 years but at some point
[55:38] Bitcoin will be so present in all our
[55:40] lives that I will be bored with it like
[55:43] it will be like talking about uh email
[55:45] or the HTP HTTP
[55:48] https protocol or something like like
[55:50] that's that's always there but you don't
[55:54] look at it specifically because like
[55:55] it's they like air to PR or something
[55:58] like that I don't want to have a podcast
[55:59] about emails like yeah look but but
[56:03] that's a really that's a really great
[56:04] analogy and but just to touch on uh on
[56:07] one thing there was a very big fight um
[56:10] in the you know uh early Internet
[56:12] Protocol days um around embedding
[56:16] privacy preserving mechanisms in the
[56:19] Internet Protocol and particularly
[56:21] around TCP over IP and there was a
[56:23] decision made to like not have some of
[56:26] these privacy preserving mechanisms you
[56:28] know it it it it's it's like looking at
[56:31] core development and what we're PRI
[56:33] prioritizing there's there's there's no
[56:36] um there's no adding of features or
[56:38] functionality without tradeoffs and and
[56:41] that's what is has been so um
[56:44] complicated and difficult for people to
[56:45] understand in the Bitcoin core
[56:47] development process there's only
[56:48] tradeoffs at the end of the day um
[56:50] privacy is an important one um but it
[56:53] comes with you
[56:55] know trade-offs not to be a broken
[56:57] record um and and that same argument and
[57:01] fight happened uh in the early days of
[57:03] the develop of developing uh the
[57:05] internet um protocol and just to go back
[57:08] to you know your your podcast and and
[57:10] really for all of these things has to be
[57:13] interesting and fun and consistent like
[57:15] if you stop having fun you should stop
[57:17] doing the podcast or at least take a
[57:18] break but as long as it's fun it gives
[57:21] you energy and it gives other people
[57:22] energy um then definitely keep going
[57:26] yeah I always say like um it it's
[57:29] sometimes like this days of like when
[57:31] you do it every day there are days where
[57:34] you feel more motivated to do it and
[57:36] sometimes like where you feel less
[57:37] motivated to do it in the first place
[57:39] the interesting thing is like always
[57:41] when you come out of the conversation
[57:43] it's always like a high because it was
[57:46] always like there's a new person you you
[57:49] learn something new with every guy girl
[57:52] I had in the podcast there's always
[57:53] something new in there it gets of course
[57:56] less and less because when you have so
[57:57] many Bitcoins on you you hear a lot of
[58:00] the same thing but you always hear also
[58:02] something new uh and and yeah my my main
[58:06] my main thing is like I try to make it
[58:08] interesting for me because then it
[58:12] probably has a good chance to be also
[58:13] interesting for The Listener uh because
[58:15] I listen to all of my podcast of course
[58:18] because I'm in the conversation uh and
[58:20] if I get bored there is probably a high
[58:23] likelihood that someone that listens
[58:25] very regular to my show that they are
[58:28] also getting bought from it so I try to
[58:30] keep it interesting for me at least uh
[58:33] because I can only guess what the fewer
[58:37] wants trust me I got
[58:40] it uh perfect then uh for the end
[58:42] routine and this is what uh is actually
[58:45] kind of like set in stone at this this
[58:48] time the end routine before we come to
[58:50] the actual end routine uh I have one
[58:52] more question what are you currently
[58:54] extremely passionate about that we did
[58:57] not cover in the podcast like I'm always
[58:59] really fascinated with bitcoiners they
[59:00] have so many different things in their
[59:02] life and they are learning about new
[59:04] things every day uh so I like want to to
[59:07] get uh like a side that we we don't uh
[59:11] hear usually about or is there something
[59:13] that we did not touch in the podcast
[59:15] that you are really passionate about or
[59:16] learning deep about H
[59:20] well building building the community in
[59:23] New York building the community back in
[59:25] New York didn't completely die I I
[59:27] always have to give a shout out to um uh
[59:30] New York bit devs and the team that has
[59:32] kept um the Socratic seminar and bit
[59:34] devs moving the folks at chain code Labs
[59:37] there's a lot of good bitcoiners in New
[59:38] York but um we put a much more public
[59:42] face on that here and that gave me a
[59:44] tremendous amount of energy uh and I
[59:46] really love doing it um I'm very excited
[59:49] to to bring that to other communities
[59:51] other cities um as you know py continues
[59:54] to grow um where really looking forward
[59:56] to that and people people are asking us
[59:58] to come to their city which is you know
[60:01] something that um is is heartwarming but
[60:04] also just a lot of responsibility I
[60:06] think that you know bitcoiners are
[60:07] looking for Community everywhere and not
[60:09] everybody's in New York so to the extent
[60:11] that we can help you know communities
[60:14] whether it's a pub key or a different
[60:15] Community build that's something I'm
[60:17] really excited about because that's much
[60:18] more visibility and I think going into
[60:21] election election season here we're
[60:23] seeing you know politician
[60:26] be a little bit more cautious with how
[60:28] they speak about Bitcoin I think that
[60:30] there is a forming voter block that's
[60:33] going to be become more and more
[60:35] important as we go um I have not been
[60:38] active in a political sense uh for ever
[60:43] uh really um but it is really
[60:46] interesting to see how these communities
[60:48] are starting to um engage with
[60:52] politicians on a hyperlocal level and
[60:55] we're starting to see that bubble up to
[60:57] National you know Federal International
[60:59] levels as well um and I hope that that
[61:02] momentum continues I think that we we
[61:04] need to we need to to um you know give
[61:08] Bitcoin a little bit of breathing room
[61:09] give the developers breathing room to
[61:10] innovate and continue to bring better
[61:12] products and services uh to the global
[61:15] Community um it's a lot of work um for
[61:18] sure and you know I'm excited to be a
[61:21] small part of it and I'm excited to see
[61:22] other people um um really get energy and
[61:26] um uh want to you know get themselves
[61:28] into the mix as
[61:30] well I I'm also really Envy about that
[61:33] uh in American politics Bitcoin is a
[61:36] topic in Austrian politics because
[61:38] Austria also has election and you also
[61:40] has election I did not hear anything
[61:42] about
[61:44] Bitcoin I'm really envy that in in
[61:47] America at least the politicians are
[61:48] forced to speak about it I heard
[61:50] something that Trump talked about it I
[61:53] did not hear anything from Biden to this
[61:54] day but I'm also really big in
[61:57] administration is extremely extremely
[61:59] hostile towards it they don't talk about
[62:01] it that much but what they what they do
[62:04] they've been very very hostile and look
[62:06] maybe it's a good thing uh Bitcoin is
[62:08] not the biggest problem in America that
[62:10] politicians should be talking about this
[62:11] is like an easy thing for them to focus
[62:13] on because they don't want to they don't
[62:15] want to focus on other parts of the
[62:17] house that are on fire um so it
[62:20] it's much easier for them to talk about
[62:22] you know Tablo items which you know
[62:24] Bitcoin kind of is right now bcoin is
[62:26] still tiny and um you know we it would
[62:30] be nice if politicians focused on
[62:32] infrastructure and other systemic issues
[62:34] um but you know if they're going to
[62:36] battle out Bitcoin I hope that you know
[62:38] we land on the right side of it and they
[62:39] just sort of like leave us alone and
[62:41] allow developers to
[62:43] develop yeah I was uh I usually really
[62:46] don't listen to politics but I listen to
[62:48] the um leading candidates debate the
[62:51] first leading candidates debate in in
[62:53] Austria for the EU uh election in in
[62:56] June I think it is um and I was so
[62:59] disappointed with the topics because the
[63:01] topics all kind of related only to the
[63:05] Ukraine crisis with Ukraine and and
[63:07] Russia and I was like of course it's a
[63:10] topic and of course people are
[63:12] interested in that but it's not the only
[63:14] thing we can also talk about other stuff
[63:16] I feel like yeah yeah process the whole
[63:21] process can be you know quite
[63:23] depressing I look forward to it all
[63:26] you know being over uh in November um
[63:30] but you know then there's always you
[63:32] know another problem just around the
[63:34] corner there there's always something
[63:35] going on in politics um now to the
[63:38] actual end routine where the previous
[63:39] guest is asking um a question for the
[63:42] next guest without knowing who the next
[63:44] guest actually is I I love this this end
[63:47] routine because it always brings up
[63:48] something interesting uh the question
[63:50] for you is what has to happen for you to
[63:53] leave your country like in that sense
[63:55] America
[63:56] [Laughter]
[63:59] um jeez uh well what has to
[64:05] happen well I guess there's good and bad
[64:07] in that right like better opportunities
[64:09] elsewhere or a lack of opportunities
[64:11] here are the the the broad Strokes um if
[64:17] if bitcoiners become villainized to a
[64:19] certain extent and it and it prevents
[64:21] you know OPP opportunity and you know
[64:24] the right to um uh enjoy enjoy life as
[64:27] an American then that would be probably
[64:29] the negative aspect that drives me out
[64:32] um the positive aspect is I mean I don't
[64:35] know maybe I get a great job opportunity
[64:37] in Fiji or something and uh we're going
[64:39] we're gon to go open up pubkey
[64:42] Fiji I I would definitely come to that
