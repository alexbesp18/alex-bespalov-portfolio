[00:00] Satoshi do not exist the units of the
[00:01] Bitcoin system they do not exist you
[00:03] sold me that's great the title is not a
[00:06] click bait that that's as real as it
[00:08] could get why do Satoshi not exist the
[00:10] reason they don't exist is like if you
[00:12] take a look at a transaction and you try
[00:13] to see where are they there no Satoshi
[00:15] and I'm making a computer scientific
[00:17] argument here I'm not making a
[00:18] philosophical one I will ask you again
[00:20] if you don't it is change in the world
[00:23] and there is there's no way you can deny
[00:25] the impact I just don't think is this
[00:28] highly the tagline Satoshi don't exists
[00:32] not a Bitcoin movie a movie that happens
[00:34] to be about Bitcoin what's the story
[00:37] behind this
[00:38] title well that's the punch on that's
[00:40] not the title the title is just toi
[00:42] don't exist well you know what i' I've
[00:43] noticed that uh a lot of people started
[00:46] having this idea of Bitcoin movies and
[00:49] for me that kind of bothered me a bit
[00:51] not too much just a bit because it kind
[00:53] of well the point is like a movie is a
[00:55] piece of art and the piece of art you're
[00:57] supposed to go there and not have any
[00:59] preconceived notion of it and just and
[01:01] just really really really try to figure
[01:03] out what a piece of art is about so if
[01:05] I'm telling you this is a Bitcoin movie
[01:07] I'm not leaving any room for artistic
[01:09] exploration right and and I feel like I
[01:12] feel like all the good movies that
[01:14] happen to be about a certain thematic
[01:16] they happen to be about it for example
[01:18] 2001 A Space Odyssey that's not a space
[01:20] movie that's a movie that happens to
[01:22] take space in a place in space so the
[01:25] same way I feel like I mean I want this
[01:28] to be a movie that if you're not a
[01:29] Bitcoin or you would still watch it and
[01:31] it would be like oh the theme of this
[01:32] happened to be something Bitcoin
[01:34] thematically related so I kind of wanted
[01:36] to to transmit that to some degree um
[01:40] and that's why I said it because I just
[01:41] feel everyone just feels like oh Bitcoin
[01:43] this Bitcoin that they they just put the
[01:45] Bitcoin sign on whatever they do you
[01:46] know um so yeah I guess that was some
[01:49] kind of social commentary I guess you
[01:50] could call it so so that's why you also
[01:53] put satosi don't exist and the in the
[01:55] big title and not oh
[01:58] no no the title I mean the title is It's
[02:01] that that's really what you're going to
[02:02] get in the movie that is the movie is
[02:04] going to be about the fat at Satoshi do
[02:05] not exist the units of the Bitcoin
[02:07] system they do not exist um and I
[02:10] understand that's that's quite
[02:11] intriguing uh and that's why I decided
[02:13] to make a movie about this but no the
[02:16] title is not a click bait that that's as
[02:18] real as it could get oh okay okay before
[02:20] we get deep into the movie why are you
[02:22] making a movie about Bitcoin in the
[02:25] first place like what's your motivation
[02:28] why did you came into Bitcoin why you
[02:30] make the Bitcoin movie and what's your
[02:32] Bitcoin story till now okay I guess I
[02:35] should start with the Bitcoin story then
[02:37] well uh I got I was studying computer
[02:39] science in 2012 in Romania in Bucharest
[02:42] and um I wasn't too happy about it I
[02:45] kind of wanted to quit anyway and I
[02:48] discovered Bitcoin by mistake and then
[02:50] ever since then every waking second of
[02:52] my life was about Bitcoin and over the
[02:54] years I've been involved in a lot of
[02:55] projects a lot of projects has to do
[02:57] with mining in the early days um I tried
[03:00] to build some apps with some friends uh
[03:02] being a part of a bunch of startups
[03:04] which none of them took off in a bit way
[03:06] but the most recent project I was
[03:07] involved in and the one I was only that
[03:09] was successful was um OTC disc that was
[03:12] called Ibex and I I was running in
[03:14] London so that's the origin story um
[03:19] what El I just why am I making a movie I
[03:20] mean this is all I've did all my life
[03:22] man like for the last 12 years of my
[03:24] life every day that's what I do I
[03:27] there's nothing else everything in my
[03:28] life is secondary to to trying to do
[03:31] things with Bitcoin um but still that
[03:33] would doesn't explain why I'm making a
[03:35] movie
[03:36] well around 2020 when Co was happening
[03:41] this OTC this that I was running was
[03:43] doing really well and I but there was
[03:46] this problem because I most of my for
[03:48] the last month most of my days were
[03:50] spent just trying to figure out how to
[03:52] do regulations and paperwork and stuff
[03:54] like that I don't like paperwork but I
[03:56] didn't like this type of paperwork and
[03:58] um you know paperwork for what exactly
[04:03] oh it was paperwork for like well we had
[04:04] to register for like pretty much kind of
[04:06] get a license was which was pretty close
[04:08] to like uh a license you get when you
[04:11] try to get a bank we weren't trying to
[04:12] become a bank but it was that type of
[04:14] scrutiny and it was just a lot of
[04:15] paperwork and I just didn't find it um
[04:18] enjoyable and then one day it was just
[04:21] like I was just waking up every day and
[04:23] I was I wasn't doing what I like and um
[04:26] at some point I was like I'm why am I
[04:27] doing this what's wrong with me I could
[04:29] stop right now and I stopped it I closed
[04:30] it down people weren't happy about that
[04:33] the people who were involved but um it
[04:35] was what it was and then after a while I
[04:38] like well I'm curious what I'm gonna do
[04:40] now and I ended up getting a camera for
[04:43] the wrong reasons and then I started
[04:46] like just easy I made my way into like
[04:49] kind of like trying to make things and
[04:51] stuff like this with the camera and
[04:53] there was this one moment I made a a
[04:55] video with a friend of mine with with
[04:56] Adam wa asking uh about nor signatures
[04:59] and that's when I said like I want to be
[05:00] a movie director this was why I put the
[05:02] why I was put on this Earth so that's
[05:04] why I'm making a movie because I just
[05:06] fall in love with this with this thing
[05:08] uh with with film making I guess you
[05:11] know and then the Bitcoin movie is
[05:13] basically like a self-explanatory if
[05:15] you're into Bitcoin if you're into movie
[05:17] making uh at some point you're making
[05:20] movies how did you get started with the
[05:22] idea of the movie like this searching of
[05:24] the team getting sponsors getting
[05:26] choosing the place uh how does this all
[05:29] come
[05:30] together well I was I was I was speaking
[05:32] with a friend of mine actually and we
[05:34] were having this chat and and we reached
[05:36] both reached the conclusion hey Satoshi
[05:38] don't exist and we're like isn't that
[05:40] such a crazy thing because we're both
[05:42] like we've been around for quite a long
[05:43] time it's like I can't believe this is
[05:45] such like such a simple and obvious
[05:47] thing I just never bothered to look at
[05:49] it I never looked at at at where Satoshi
[05:51] are and and if they are there and I was
[05:53] like that's such a funny thing I'm just
[05:55] going to go and tell everyone I know
[05:56] about this and I started telling people
[05:58] and also the people that I was telling
[05:59] uh this they're like hardcore protocol
[06:01] developers you know so they're not like
[06:03] noobs or anything like this I'm telling
[06:04] them that gu satosi don't exist and they
[06:06] have this this this weird reaction they
[06:08] just try to prove me wrong and I was
[06:11] sitting down one day and I was just
[06:12] thinking dude when I when I realized
[06:14] this when I was told this fact I was so
[06:16] happy because hey there's something new
[06:19] about Bitcoin that I didn't knew there's
[06:20] something that turns my world upside
[06:22] down I'm I'm so happy about this I wish
[06:24] this is true even though I can't wrap my
[06:26] head around it immediately why this is
[06:28] true or not but everyone else they just
[06:30] want to Pro they don't want this to be
[06:32] true and I said like why is this
[06:34] conflict of opinion and and when I see
[06:36] the word conflict I said like oh I have
[06:37] to make a movie about this you know so
[06:40] that's why I decided to make a movie
[06:41] about it
[06:42] um and and why do satosi is not exist
[06:46] like I think there already apps that
[06:49] have like the calculations you can
[06:52] change in satosi they're like satosi
[06:55] like in the Bitcoin Community I think
[06:58] really set settled as a as a as a unit
[07:02] of account from Bitcoin as a smaller uh
[07:06] unit of Bitcoin like why don't they
[07:09] exist well I'm not going to tell that
[07:11] because I would give away the movie and
[07:13] and it's not like these things weren't
[07:14] discussed before like if you go and
[07:15] search on the old forums these topics
[07:17] have been discussed before but the main
[07:19] idea the reason they don't exist is like
[07:21] if you if you if you look take a look at
[07:23] a transaction and you try to see where
[07:25] are they they're no satoshis they're
[07:27] imaginary units and as soon as hear this
[07:30] you think like oh this is supposed to be
[07:31] hard money so you start panicking a bit
[07:33] but it's no no no the reason Bitcoin has
[07:36] certain properties that it has is
[07:38] precisely because Satoshi don't exist
[07:40] and I'm making a computer scientific
[07:42] argument here I'm not making a
[07:43] philosophical one so so really the the
[07:46] the the idea would be that that I'm
[07:48] trying to explore the the intellectual
[07:50] aspect of this which is like precisely
[07:52] how it works you can look at the code
[07:54] and whatever and then there's the
[07:55] consequence of this and and then there's
[07:58] the idea of like but but but the
[07:59] interesting part is like but why do
[08:01] people react to this why why why do
[08:03] people have this weird reaction to it
[08:04] you know when they're present that
[08:07] that's crazy like I have really urge to
[08:09] see the movie now you sold me that's
[08:12] great in April it's coming out right no
[08:15] it's not well it was supposed to we
[08:17] thought it's gonna come up in April but
[08:18] it's GNA be more like July and stuff
[08:20] like that so yeah I don't even know if I
[08:21] answered your question I'm so sorry I'm
[08:23] all over the place uh it's fine I Note
[08:26] Everything I will ask you again if you
[08:28] don't know
[08:30] um did producing the movie change your P
[08:34] perspective on on on first like like
[08:38] usually when I go deep in a topic um and
[08:42] then make a video out of it I made this
[08:44] earlier and now I'm only making the
[08:46] podcast but ear I make like videos uh
[08:48] from specific topics and I sometimes
[08:51] this discover when I also also when I
[08:53] make a tweet and I research about a
[08:55] topic there sometimes the research
[08:57] process and getting the information in a
[09:00] nice order it can change my VI a little
[09:04] bit about the topic but because you
[09:07] researching differently when you're
[09:09] putting the information together for
[09:10] someone else or only you that's for me
[09:14] it makes a difference uh I don't know if
[09:16] if it's the same for you oh I definitely
[09:18] agree with TR there was a part of the
[09:20] process which was like that I was as as
[09:24] sorry as as I was researching was
[09:25] getting more concrete and I was seeing
[09:27] other things but I spent six months
[09:29] researching this and I had Adam the guy
[09:31] who I did the first video with he's the
[09:33] technical consultant on the on the movie
[09:35] he's a really smart guy one of smartest
[09:37] people I ever met in my life anyway so
[09:39] so it wasn't like so when I said I'm
[09:41] gonna make the movie like there was no
[09:43] surprises left for me there was nothing
[09:45] that anyone on the planet could show me
[09:47] or or tell me that I didn't thought
[09:48] about right uh but in the ear but in the
[09:51] beginning yeah um I guess the thing
[09:53] things that I knew and I didn't
[09:56] initially I didn't um figure it out
[10:00] um what you know was interesting is like
[10:04] well the idea is that because the the
[10:06] whole conflict of this movie the whole
[10:08] premise of the movie was the conflict
[10:10] between the fact that that I reacted the
[10:12] certain way this information and other
[10:14] people reacted this way I said that you
[10:16] know I want this movie to be I want to I
[10:18] want to talk with some other people
[10:19] about this and it's not gonna be
[10:21] necessarily strictly like a documentary
[10:23] it will be more like um it will be like
[10:26] a movie he's not going to be just
[10:27] Talking Heads but I want to talk with
[10:29] other people and what really surpris and
[10:30] I ended up talking with free people I
[10:32] went to this place called BTC aorus
[10:34] which is an unconference uh which is
[10:37] it's kind of weird there's this island
[10:38] in the middle of of Atlantic and people
[10:40] go there and talk about Bitcoin so I
[10:42] went there and I interviewed some people
[10:44] but sorry what I found out is like while
[10:46] talking with these people the way they
[10:48] explained something that I thought about
[10:50] it was so odd that I would have never be
[10:52] able to say it like that you know and I
[10:54] don't want to say what it is because I'd
[10:56] give away the the interesting parts of
[10:58] the movie but um and also you know what
[11:00] was also interesting is like all the
[11:01] free people that I talk with they all
[11:03] said the exact same thing to the T there
[11:06] was no disagreement about like how this
[11:08] fact works but their conclusion around
[11:10] the fact was like everyone had it
[11:12] differently and I thought that was so
[11:13] interesting because
[11:16] um like there was no conflict on the
[11:18] technicals but as soon as you went away
[11:20] from the technical that's when the
[11:21] conflict came about with interpretation
[11:23] and stuff so and these are also the
[11:25] three people that are on the X Channel
[11:29] uh uh presented like uh how I didn't
[11:32] know I don't remember the names Daniela
[11:34] I think there two guys one
[11:37] girl yeah yeah so the thing is like when
[11:40] I when I I realized that the way I want
[11:42] to approach this topic like I said I
[11:44] definitely want to go as deep as you can
[11:46] on this topic that being said um this is
[11:48] not an explainer video or it is a movie
[11:51] and it will be entertaining so I I
[11:54] figured out you know what I need to find
[11:55] some people that really have the
[11:58] intellectual cap capacity of going
[12:00] anywhere on this topic not just th not
[12:02] just necessarily computer science but
[12:04] philosophy or anywhere it might go but
[12:06] they also have to be interesting because
[12:08] the thing is like when you write a
[12:10] character in a movie you get to decide
[12:12] how the character is and he has certain
[12:13] like characteristics and and that's what
[12:15] draws you to it sorry the one thing is
[12:18] like a good character is idiosyncratic
[12:20] idiosyncratic means like it has
[12:22] something that stands out so then I made
[12:24] a list a huge list of people who are
[12:26] smart and are kind of like a movie
[12:28] character and I ended up trying to see
[12:31] who's going to come on the island there
[12:32] and whatever and that's why I ended up
[12:33] with them and the three people are sge
[12:35] prus who's um old school um core
[12:39] contributor Josie bake who's who's also
[12:42] core contributor and then alberon who's
[12:45] um uh BDK contributor so yeah these were
[12:48] the the the
[12:49] people and the movie is actually just
[12:52] about the premise that there is uh like
[12:55] obviously it's it's you don't want to
[12:57] speak too much about the move movies
[12:59] content but it's you said it's not
[13:02] explaining Bitcoin it's explaining the
[13:05] premise of the title so it's not a movie
[13:07] for newes it's more like a movie for
[13:10] bitcoiners if I understood it right um
[13:15] so yeah the thing is like you know like
[13:18] have you ever seen any West andon
[13:20] movies uh no no um he has
[13:26] um it it it's hard to explain this
[13:29] without having a a point of reference
[13:32] but
[13:33] um um I'm trying to think of of a movie
[13:37] that that kind of is very close to to
[13:39] how this was um the idea is
[13:43] that there's this there's a narrative
[13:45] structure to the movie there definitely
[13:47] is a narrative structure and the
[13:48] narrative structure is that I came up
[13:50] with this whole thing and I then I went
[13:52] and talked with some people on this
[13:53] island and that's where the event took
[13:55] place so that's what's going to happen
[13:58] yeah yes so everything is also recorded
[14:00] on the
[14:01] island uh a big part of it is recorded n
[14:04] Island yes a big part of what happened
[14:06] is is recorded on the island yes I I I I
[14:09] like the idea of people making content
[14:11] about Bitcoin it's it's such an
[14:13] important uh topic it's like it goes
[14:16] into Freedom it goes into money goes
[14:18] into a broken system like um what what
[14:22] is the most important thing for you in
[14:25] in in Bitcoin what what drives you to
[14:28] make content into this field like what
[14:31] property is like that's what I want to
[14:35] be in Bitcoin like if you orange build
[14:38] someone new like a grill party or
[14:40] something I never even though I always
[14:43] intellectualize the them to understand
[14:45] about
[14:46] Bitcoin sorry what do you want them to
[14:49] understand about Bitcoin I don't want in
[14:52] oh I I actually don't want anyone to
[14:54] understand anything uh uh as I said this
[14:56] is a movie I wanted to feel something I
[14:58] I don't want him to understand anything
[14:59] I'm not trying to explain anything I'm
[15:01] not trying even to convince people of
[15:03] Satoshi don't exist you what I'm trying
[15:05] to capture is like is this you know how
[15:07] for me it's like this I I I discovered
[15:10] Bitcoin and in the moment I discovered
[15:12] there was this feeling this my heart
[15:14] stopped for a second and I was this is
[15:17] incredible and and the reason why it was
[15:19] incredible is like as soon as that that
[15:20] came into my mind I can see all the
[15:22] implications ramification all these
[15:24] things now I don't want to tell you
[15:25] those implications I want you to feel
[15:28] that same feeling that that happened
[15:29] there that's what I'm trying to capture
[15:30] in this movie and and this this feeling
[15:32] was when I when I was like this whole
[15:33] thing was satos didn't exist it was just
[15:36] like time stopped for a moment my I was
[15:38] like if they don't exist then this
[15:40] happen and this happened this happen and
[15:41] all these things are going in my head
[15:43] and and that that feeling of like oh my
[15:45] God this is magical that's what I'm
[15:47] trying to to give in this movie so so
[15:50] that's why I'm trying to say like you
[15:51] don't have to be technical or you don't
[15:53] have to like do your homework is like I
[15:54] want you to capture that feeling but
[15:57] again it is talking about Bitcoin so it
[16:00] will have some concrete elements I hope
[16:02] that answer the question yeah it's I'm
[16:05] I'm really looking forward to the to the
[16:06] movie and I think we will we cover the
[16:09] movie right uh so that you didn't give
[16:11] up uh any content that is in there but
[16:15] still make people really want to see it
[16:17] I'm looking forward to July you said
[16:19] right um yeah I I will release a trailer
[16:22] by the way probably by the end of
[16:24] January or something depending how the
[16:25] filming is go and and and that will will
[16:28] reveal bit more about it you know uh so
[16:30] I'm not trying to be super super
[16:31] secretive but um yeah yeah this would be
[16:36] actually my next question if if there's
[16:37] a trailer coming up before July so
[16:39] January is a is trailer coming up with
[16:42] the with the launch of the Bitcoin spot
[16:47] ETF yeah I don't know that that would be
[16:49] cool if if that would happen um yeah I
[16:53] don't want to make any promises but but
[16:54] like maybe maybe end of febru maybe end
[16:57] of January a trailer is is going to come
[16:58] out yeah did you saw the
[17:01] advertisements uh from uh I think like
[17:05] two or three already came out with
[17:07] Bitcoin ETF ads um before even the
[17:11] approval came did you saw the ads yeah I
[17:13] saw the one with a meme guy I thought
[17:15] that was that one was the best made out
[17:17] of all of them the most interesting guy
[17:19] on Earth uh what how did you like it
[17:22] like what would you how would you make
[17:25] an ad for for a Bitcoin ETF for like
[17:27] example
[17:29] c yeah well I mean I I also maybe should
[17:32] have clarified like for the most part
[17:34] since I started making movies I only
[17:36] made commercials and this is my first
[17:37] movie that I'm making um I only made
[17:40] commercials so so and I studied
[17:41] commercials and also the movie is going
[17:43] to include commercials inside it and I
[17:45] know that sounds kind of odd but anyway
[17:47] to answer the question ah gee I don't
[17:49] know like um how would I make a Comm
[17:51] it's hard because when I make a
[17:52] commercial like there's no way I could
[17:54] have an idea about it I would have to
[17:56] talk with a client and they would have
[17:58] to tell tell me what they want to do and
[17:59] then I would have to tell the story well
[18:01] well I don't know it's like what do you
[18:02] think it's why do you think anyone would
[18:03] need an ETF that's an interesting
[18:06] question because uh I would never buy an
[18:09] ETF uh but I understand I understand
[18:13] there are people out there that just
[18:16] trust
[18:17] their legacy Financial systems so much
[18:20] and they need a financial advisor
[18:22] telling them uh to buy Bitcoin so I also
[18:25] think that um in the ETF game it will be
[18:29] more about sales people and less about
[18:31] ads because uh you need the financial
[18:34] advises you need the salese actually
[18:36] selling the high ticket clients the the
[18:39] ETFs like hey you should invest 1% 5%
[18:42] 10% 20% of your portfolio in Bitcoin and
[18:46] I think it will be different I was just
[18:49] curious because we like Bitcoin ETF is
[18:51] like right now a big topic maybe not as
[18:55] big when the podcast from ARS now comes
[18:57] up because today is the second of
[18:58] January it comes out like maybe middle
[19:00] or end of January Hour episode so if you
[19:03] if someone watching this um so it will
[19:07] be interesting how the ad uh are well if
[19:11] I would have to make an ad right now I
[19:13] would think for the thing is like mainly
[19:15] the main purpose to to use an ETF is if
[19:17] you're like a financial institution
[19:19] because you you can't get exposure to
[19:21] this in any other way right you need a
[19:23] specific type of financial product so I
[19:26] would I would kind of like just I would
[19:27] kind of try to turn around this whole
[19:29] thing of like an Institutional thing I
[19:32] would probably try to create some kind
[19:33] of small narrative structure of having
[19:36] someone who doesn't look like it's an
[19:38] instit like when you think of an
[19:39] institution you think someone in a suit
[19:41] and button down and all these things I
[19:44] would find the most spk rocker I I would
[19:46] follow the a person waking up who has
[19:49] the most punk rock way of like living in
[19:51] the house walking there getting in the
[19:53] car on a motorcycle I don't know having
[19:55] tattoos doing drugs on the way I don't
[19:57] know something like that and then he
[19:58] walks in and then in his office he buys
[20:01] the ATF that's what I would do I would
[20:02] just turn it around so everyone would be
[20:04] like oh I would never expect that I
[20:06] think that would be actually a good one
[20:09] um I don't know yeah could be could be
[20:13] you have uh this is a completely random
[20:16] question from me now and maybe there's
[20:18] nothing behind it but um I saw your ex
[20:21] profile and I saw you handle raw
[20:24] avocado yeah does this has any story
[20:27] where is it coming from a raw avoc oh no
[20:30] no it is the most uninteresting story uh
[20:33] the first time I had a avocado in
[20:35] Romania uh I realized it was ripe it was
[20:38] not ripe it was raw um and that's when I
[20:42] opened my Twitter I think and that's how
[20:44] that came about but it it has no meaning
[20:46] or no nothing and I'm not vegan a lot of
[20:49] people ask me I'm not vegan not at all
[20:52] no I couldn't be further from veganism
[20:55] actually yeah that would be actually my
[20:58] next question because uh some sometimes
[21:01] the avocado stands for like the
[21:03] plan-based uh movement a little bit in
[21:06] my in my view as my
[21:10] thing
[21:12] um where do you see when you look out in
[21:16] the bitcoin's future like maybe 100
[21:18] years ago because I'm I always like to
[21:20] to see what people think about Bitcoin
[21:23] in like 100 years or like 20 years like
[21:25] really far into the future where
[21:28] um we might actually have a chance of uh
[21:32] seeing that Revol Revolution going on um
[21:36] where do you see Bitcoin do you see it
[21:38] as replacing Fe do you see living
[21:42] besides Fe how how will it change or is
[21:45] it just money and it uh does not change
[21:47] a
[21:48] lot yeah I mean you know I used to think
[21:50] for a long time probably in the first
[21:53] years that you know this is going to
[21:55] come and replace fat and it says all the
[21:58] TR all the evil in the world is going to
[22:00] be saved by Bitcoin but I don't think
[22:02] that's going to be true um I just think
[22:05] it's it it is probably gonna leave
[22:07] alongside it I mean I think it's easy I
[22:09] think there are a lot of people who came
[22:10] up with optimistic scenarios for this I
[22:13] would I would think it' be more
[22:14] interesting think of a more pessimistic
[22:16] one like I think a big pess a big
[22:20] pessimistic scenario and I hope this
[22:21] this is not going to happen but a
[22:23] pessimistic scenario is the miners get
[22:25] captured by reg by regulations and we
[22:27] don't have censorship resistance you
[22:29] know and the weird part about that I
[22:32] about that is that I think we could have
[22:33] that system and Bitcoin would probably
[22:35] still be up in price you know so I hope
[22:38] that's not what's gonna happen but uh I
[22:40] don't know 20 years is just so hard to
[22:41] say
[22:42] because I mean I know I I used to make
[22:45] predictions even five years ago and
[22:47] they're all so couldn't be further away
[22:49] from you know what we expected um I
[22:52] don't I I'm sorry I know people usually
[22:54] like to go on podcast and be like it's
[22:56] going to save the world it's going to do
[22:57] all these things but I just don't
[22:58] believe that I just don't I can't I
[23:00] don't feel like I couldn't say that
[23:02] because I don't believe it 100% you know
[23:04] yeah I I I I have both both side of
[23:08] people on actually like there there are
[23:10] people saying oh it will it will be a
[23:13] revolution even spiritual spiritual for
[23:15] all people it and but there are also
[23:18] people that say come on it's just money
[23:20] it's like uh it it it will maybe uh be
[23:24] an evolution for the for the money
[23:26] sphere and it will be an way for people
[23:29] how to save effectively money but if you
[23:33] put in the work you could have done it
[23:35] before also kind of inter fear system
[23:37] with real estate stocks ETFs and stuff
[23:39] like that so it's just another vehicle
[23:42] and it's interesting how how Bitcoin has
[23:44] a SE how different the um objectives
[23:47] here
[23:48] are I mean I just just to be very clear
[23:51] it it it already is revolutionizing the
[23:53] world it is changing the world and there
[23:55] is there's no way you can deny the
[23:57] impact I just don't think is this highly
[23:59] utopic thing I just don't see how that
[24:01] could ever make sense um actually I
[24:04] think it's dangerous like when someone
[24:05] promise you Utopia uh behind every
[24:08] utopic promise there's always some kind
[24:10] of like you know um dictatorship to some
[24:13] degree so
[24:16] yeah yeah it's it's it's hard but the I
[24:19] think it's the the main Revolution
[24:22] behind it is that there is no Creator
[24:25] like we still don't know who's the the
[24:27] mot and if it's a guy a girl group of
[24:31] people there's so many fears about it I
[24:33] was I was obsessed in the beginning
[24:36] actually with the story about it and I
[24:39] read I think two or three books about it
[24:41] who s Nakamoto might be there are like
[24:44] really people out there and analyzing
[24:47] every email analyzing everything he kind
[24:50] of left like the the language he used
[24:52] the the accent he might be Associated
[24:56] and there and in in my end of the
[25:00] research just concluded there is no one
[25:03] strategy that he might be this person or
[25:05] might be that person and yeah moving on
[25:09] from Bitcoin uh as a
[25:12] filmmaker you might have an unique view
[25:15] about social media like what what
[25:18] platform do you like the most I guess
[25:22] YouTube um no well you know I I'm mostly
[25:25] active on Twitter you know and I post
[25:28] quite a lot and I I don't know if you
[25:29] notice but recently I said that I
[25:31] realized we have to start promoting the
[25:32] movie and I tried tried to Mak a bit
[25:35] more effort in that in that regard so by
[25:37] the time this goes out there should be a
[25:39] lot of post that that I I made Twitter
[25:42] is definitely my favorite because I like
[25:43] to talk a lot you know I also post
[25:45] things on Instagram because I take
[25:46] photography um I do photography just to
[25:49] practice composition and stuff but no
[25:52] it's probably goingon to be a Twitter
[25:55] the only I also like I mean if I'm going
[25:57] to post video videos I would prefer on
[25:58] YouTube because it's better format but
[26:01] yeah Twitter yeah Twitter also has they
[26:03] are working really hard to to push
[26:06] videos at least I see it that when I
[26:08] have a a video it kind of gets pushed a
[26:10] little bit more I think it gets an gets
[26:12] in
[26:14] poost more instead of just a picture or
[26:17] just a text um what would you change
[26:20] about XA how it like is now would you
[26:24] have an standard section just for like
[26:27] videos you have anything want that I
[26:30] mean I'm I'm actually very happy with
[26:32] what elas did I don't really don't
[26:33] understand why how how people were were
[26:35] cheering on uh when Jack was at the at
[26:38] the boat when it was awful it was it was
[26:41] absolutely awful like I mean and the
[26:43] things that came out of out of the
[26:44] Twitter files is like oh my God and all
[26:46] of a sudden Elon Musk KES everything is
[26:49] good about it every single change he
[26:51] makes literally made the platform 10
[26:53] times better I don't understand why
[26:54] people are not happy the only thing I
[26:55] would change is it's very simple I just
[26:57] want better quality video I mean I spend
[26:59] like you know a lot of money on my
[27:01] equipment to get like super quality
[27:04] video and I when you put it on on
[27:07] Twitter it compresses a lot that's
[27:08] probably the only thing I would change
[27:10] but I'm very happy with Twitter I use it
[27:12] a lot I like it you know yeah it it's it
[27:14] also recommends you to only upload in
[27:17] 720 and not in HD so it's it's it's but
[27:21] I always try to get the highest quality
[27:24] up um that's that's funny um we are
[27:28] having an an Andro at the the podcast
[27:31] where the previous guest asked a
[27:34] question for the next guest um and your
[27:37] question is an interesting one how much
[27:39] Freedom Is Enough freedom for
[27:42] you oh I just feel freedom with caveats
[27:45] is not Freedom that's where I lean in
[27:47] that thing and of course that sounds
[27:49] very scary you know
[27:50] because I mean Al I mean when you think
[27:53] about it it's like ultimate Freedom
[27:55] really means there's no walls around you
[27:57] and at some point Humanity was existing
[27:59] like that there were no walls around us
[28:01] and and life was probably incredibly
[28:04] difficult and probably some people got
[28:05] together is like we have to put some
[28:07] walls around us we in some sense you're
[28:09] limiting the freedom you know um and
[28:12] then this went to some degree over you
[28:14] know probably a few hundred thousand
[28:16] years and now here we are which things
[28:18] are quite a bit stable but just's too
[28:21] much walls and there's nothing wrong
[28:23] with having walls but the problem is
[28:25] that someone comes and builds a wrong
[28:27] wall around you and I'm talking about
[28:29] like you know like the state or
[28:30] something like that um and even though
[28:33] life is the best has ever been that's
[28:35] kind of happen now so I I just feel like
[28:38] that's how Freedom looks like and also
[28:39] like another I had this incredible
[28:41] cultural shock when I first went to the
[28:43] US um I never saw a gun in my life right
[28:45] now here I am shooting gun at guns at a
[28:48] range and and I just I um you know
[28:51] everyone was just making fun of me of
[28:53] how you know here we we don't have
[28:55] freedom and to some degree they kind of
[28:57] our right because I'm not I'm not sure
[28:59] about the guns precisely but but just as
[29:02] a general comment on this thing it's
[29:03] like I would rather prefer less
[29:06] intervention from the state and whatever
[29:08] and I want to take matters in my own
[29:10] hand and protect myself and then be
[29:13] overprotected um so but but but to get
[29:15] back to the original question yeah I I
[29:17] don't think Freedom has caveats Freedom
[29:18] with caveats there's no you know there's
[29:20] not Freedom so there there cannot be
[29:24] enough
[29:25] Freedom what are you saying okay
[29:29] yeah I mean that's how I see it anyway
[29:33] um yeah I and I I feel like that's kind
[29:36] of like the main promise of of Bitcoin
[29:38] to some degree the idea is that no one
[29:40] can stop you from you know broadcasting
[29:42] a transaction with whatever caveats and
[29:45] stuff like that so um yeah yeah that's
[29:50] where I lean on this thing I I guess I
[29:52] probably would would think that I like
[29:54] some kind of a narco capitalist type
[29:57] I sympath I don't know if I would like
[29:59] it but I sympathize with it yeah me too
[30:03] me too very much even um I usually asked
[30:08] where people can find you uh and and
[30:11] where do you want to put direct people
[30:15] do but I guess it's on X and Satoshi
[30:18] doesn't exist satosi doesn't exist on
[30:22] the the Twitter Channel also the
[30:24] film yeah I mean you can find me at
[30:26] Round avocado definitely and uh yeah you
[30:30] can find the movie there and also we
[30:31] have a gazer campaign so if you want to
[30:33] donate to the movie uh donations that's
[30:35] very much appreciated oh you actually
[30:38] asked me at some point I didn't answer
[30:39] like about the production proc and how I
[30:42] found the sponsors yeah um but but yeah
[30:45] I mean that that's where you can find
[30:46] the find find me and find details about
[30:50] the the movie there
[30:52] yeah how how did you go and ahead and
[30:55] and like because a movie I don't know
[30:59] like it depends of course how how high
[31:01] quality and high cost of production you
[31:04] you make it but you you need quite a
[31:06] time from the team you need the
[31:08] equipment you need to place uh it can be
[31:10] cost costly how did you go ahead and
[31:13] then make it happen well the thing is
[31:16] like I said I only made commercials
[31:17] before that and and I don't know if my
[31:20] commercials are good or not that's up to
[31:22] people to decide but I do know the
[31:25] quality is there I know I could put my
[31:27] commercials up to anything else and and
[31:29] everyone said this you know um so and I
[31:33] studied commercials a lot so now when I
[31:34] came when the idea came to make this
[31:36] movie I realized that even though it's
[31:38] gonna be have a specific narrative
[31:40] structure it's gonna be quite loose
[31:42] that's why I was talking abouts Anderson
[31:44] movies it's like it's not like The
[31:46] Godfather where like you need to follow
[31:48] what's going on and whatever it's gonna
[31:49] be a bit more playful so when I realized
[31:52] that's going to happen I realized that
[31:54] that stylistically I can do a lot of
[31:56] things and and then I was sitting down
[31:58] at some point and I was like dude we
[32:01] should have some products placements and
[32:03] I was like here's the truth if I'm going
[32:04] to have a product placement in my movie
[32:07] um I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
[32:09] make it look nice and I'm gonna make
[32:11] sure stylistically everything works with
[32:13] the movie and and and it's like I'm
[32:16] gonna make it like a commercial and I
[32:17] was like why don't I just do that anyway
[32:19] because what happened most of the time
[32:21] people go to uh somewhere to a company
[32:24] especially people who make Bitcoin
[32:26] movies and they go like hey can you
[32:27] please sponsor us out of the goodness of
[32:29] your heart um and then people say like
[32:32] yeah sure maybe and that's that but I
[32:35] figured out why don't I just go to these
[32:37] companies and tell them like here's the
[32:39] thing uh we we'll we'll place your
[32:42] product in the movie and we'll make it
[32:44] in the style of the movie and will make
[32:45] it like a commercial like the ones I
[32:47] made and you get to keep keep the
[32:49] commercial
[32:50] afterwards so it wasn't like pretty much
[32:52] like hey do this out of the goodness of
[32:53] your heart now now this is a business
[32:56] deal right now you know and also like if
[32:58] if you know in the marketing promotions
[33:00] and stuff like that depending on what
[33:02] kind of uh sponsorship happens uh the
[33:04] people are going to be featured so when
[33:06] that happened you know people were a bit
[33:08] more open to it they was like well this
[33:09] sounds kind of interesting you know I
[33:11] mean even if the movie fails in the
[33:12] worst possible way we're getting a
[33:14] commercial out of it so um so they can
[33:17] use the commercial and
[33:20] uh to get value out of this anyways um
[33:25] one question came up to me also Where do
[33:27] you um get the movie out like how do you
[33:31] distribute the
[33:33] movie yeah well um that's also like I
[33:36] the ideally would be to get it on
[33:37] Netflix or something like this but I
[33:39] just have to be realistic I'm a
[33:40] first-time director so and again like I
[33:43] know I don't know anyone in the movie
[33:45] industry so I have to be realistic about
[33:47] this even though I I still don't think
[33:49] that like like the chances are
[33:50] impossible I just think the chances are
[33:52] low and I want to Mage expectations so
[33:54] but but that would be the ideal Target
[33:56] other than that um yeah there's quite a
[33:59] few options obviously to just do it on
[34:00] the YouTube channel um or just find some
[34:04] other like Distributors that's a bit
[34:06] lower tier and try to have it there I um
[34:09] there's that movie that came out there
[34:11] to
[34:12] dream the El Salvador one and they ended
[34:14] up getting like on on Apple and on um
[34:19] Amazon and stuff like that uh so I I
[34:22] think I we would have a chance also with
[34:24] this movie um to go there but I it's
[34:28] really early I don't I I don't have the
[34:30] answer to that yet there will be a
[34:32] Premiere I will say um it's kind of like
[34:35] 90% chance the premier is goingon to be
[34:37] in Berlin like a a physical Premiere but
[34:40] I don't also don't want to make any
[34:41] promises because that's still further
[34:42] away but yeah a premier in berin it's
[34:46] it's not that far from my place so I
[34:48] would definitely uh come where you where
[34:52] where are you if you can say uh lince
[34:54] Lind it's in Austria uh in AA okay I
[34:57] mean Berlin is actually not as close uh
[35:02] because Germany is obviously in the
[35:04] border from from Austria but uh Berlin
[35:07] is high up and Austria like down so it
[35:09] would be like I don't know one or two
[35:11] hours flight or like five six seven
[35:13] hours with the car around that time I
[35:16] would suggest but for like a nice movie
[35:19] uh I would definitely come to
[35:21] building oh listen I'll promise you uh I
[35:24] don't know what's going to happen and
[35:25] where that's going to take place yet but
