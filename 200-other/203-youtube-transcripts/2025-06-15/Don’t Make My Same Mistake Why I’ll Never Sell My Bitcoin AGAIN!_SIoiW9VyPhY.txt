[00:00] I'm majority of it anyway like 90
[00:02] something% Bitcoin whatever 10 15% I
[00:05] have left into shitcoin I was hoping to
[00:07] see an alcoin season uh to to get rid of
[00:09] it we will see still a huge amount of
[00:12] people they'll gamble with these tokens
[00:14] especially with some horrible ideas like
[00:16] XRP and all those terrible coins but
[00:19] we've seen it also in the Trump
[00:20] administration they have a stack right
[00:22] with Cardano XRP Solana I don't think
[00:24] we're going to get rid of them sailor
[00:26] with strategy is another major major
[00:28] issue I think because What happens when
[00:30] he steps down? What happens when I don't
[00:32] know in 10 years from now someone else
[00:34] takes the company goes this Bitcoin
[00:35] thing I'm done man let's sell it we
[00:37] don't know the question I I have in my
[00:39] head is why am I selling for if you are
[00:41] plugged in like me if you have nothing
[00:43] else but Bitcoin well you have no other
[00:44] option but if you have a job if you have
[00:46] a normal job who pays you in fiat and
[00:48] you have everything around you is quote
[00:50] normal but you don't sell your Bitcoin
[00:52] why would you sell it for whoever comes
[00:54] in into the crypto machine and they
[00:56] stick around they'll be maxis in couple
[00:58] of cycles inevitable
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] We must spend
[01:06] Bitcoin. That's uh that's something
[01:09] maybe that no one is talking about cuz
[01:11] everyone is like, "Oh, you you don't
[01:12] sell your Bitcoin." No, you do. You
[01:14] spend them, which is very controversial,
[01:16] but um I think it depends on the
[01:18] situation you are in. I mean, I have a
[01:20] strong position on the matter cuz I I I
[01:23] only have Bitcoin. I have nothing else.
[01:24] So, am I supposed to not selling it, not
[01:26] spending it? What am I supposed to be
[01:27] living with? like
[01:30] air. So, you know, of course, when
[01:33] sailors said things like, "Oh, you you
[01:35] don't sell your Bitcoin." Well, it
[01:37] depends. If if Bitcoin is everything you
[01:39] have, you have to sell Bitcoin. Plus,
[01:41] who wants to buy an asset? Nobody wants
[01:43] to buy or sell. It's useless, right? It
[01:45] has to circulate. Um, are you now
[01:47] completely uh Bitcoin only, like 100%
[01:50] Bitcoin and and it dropped everything
[01:52] else. No, no, not yet because we didn't
[01:54] have a an alcoin season, right? So, and
[01:57] I don't think we maybe we won't even
[01:58] have it because the Bitcoin dominance is
[02:00] going higher. So, the plan was to wait
[02:02] until the the ratio between Bitcoin and
[02:05] altcoins would have been I mean I'm
[02:08] majority of it anyway like 90 something%
[02:10] Bitcoin, but um whatever 10 15% I have
[02:14] left into Shitcoin. I was hoping to see
[02:16] an alcoin season uh to to get rid of it.
[02:19] But um at least Ethereum is dying. If
[02:21] you chart Ethereum versus Bitcoin, oh my
[02:23] god, it's very depressing. like if if
[02:26] you have Ethereum of course if you hold
[02:28] Ethereum really depressing. So, I was
[02:31] hoping for, I don't know, like a better
[02:33] maybe move, but I I still believe that
[02:35] at some point when Bitcoin is going to
[02:37] go because I think we have another leg
[02:38] up at least 150 or 180, then at that
[02:42] point over there, people are going to
[02:44] take profit into altcoins cuz it happens
[02:46] every single time. And if history proves
[02:49] to be, you know, correct, then we will
[02:52] see another speculation happening. If
[02:54] not, well, then the cycles have changed
[02:57] forever, right? It's possible.
[03:00] I see kind of strategy and Bitcoin
[03:04] associated products and leveraged
[03:06] products because strategy is basically
[03:08] for me a leverage position on Bitcoin
[03:10] and you can even take a leverage on on
[03:12] strategy or micro strategy. This is kind
[03:15] of the altcoin season if if you because
[03:17] most of the people say like oh I like
[03:20] Bitcoin but I'm like with 10% or 5% of
[03:23] my portfolio I'm also gambling in
[03:25] altcoins to get a little bit more
[03:27] Bitcoin. Yeah, I want to outperform
[03:29] Bitcoin. Now, you can do that with an
[03:31] actual business with like an actual CEO
[03:33] like there's a wellestablished business
[03:36] where you don't have to rely on a
[03:38] project that might have been around for
[03:40] like half half a year or something like
[03:42] that where maybe tomorrow it's
[03:44] completely gone. So, it feels like
[03:47] strategy is now a safer bet to
[03:50] outperform Bitcoin and might steal the
[03:52] thunder for altcoin season. Yeah, that's
[03:55] an interesting point. I I still think we
[03:57] have the crypto people though they are
[03:59] not going to buy an ETF or for example
[04:00] you can also buy MSDY which is an
[04:03] interesting play which is speculation
[04:04] options. So you can be a degenerate even
[04:06] if you have even if you are in financial
[04:08] traditional financial tradeifi
[04:10] traditional financial system but I still
[04:12] think the crypto people are going to
[04:13] degen into into altcoins right they're
[04:16] going to buy Solana buy Ethereum buy
[04:18] Cardano whatever because that's I mean
[04:21] maybe this time will be different but I
[04:22] strongly disagree I think we will see
[04:25] still a huge amount of people they'll
[04:28] gamble with these tokens especially with
[04:31] some like horrible ideas like XRP and
[04:34] all those terri coins, but we've seen it
[04:37] also in the Trump administration. They
[04:38] have a stack, right, with Cardano, XRP,
[04:41] Salana. I don't think we're going to get
[04:43] rid of them. Um, also with the memecoin
[04:45] has gone bananas. I think at some point
[04:47] there was like 20,000 tokens a day. I
[04:50] mean, crazy stuff, right? So, I don't
[04:52] think we will be able to clean
[04:54] completely uh the thing. There's going
[04:57] to be people gambling in our coins. I
[04:59] think maybe they have more options these
[05:01] days. They have more more meme coins.
[05:03] There is more plays. I think we'll see
[05:05] more ETFs coming up. ETF for XRP, ETF
[05:08] for we already have one for Ethereum,
[05:10] which is going terribly by the way, but
[05:12] I think that's going to help the crypto
[05:14] gamblers in Wall Street to take some
[05:16] positions. But like I said, I still I'm
[05:18] still expecting alcoins to rise at some
[05:21] point. The dominance from Bitcoin is
[05:23] taking over. But um it only happens in
[05:26] in the cycles, right? Bitcoin goes up in
[05:28] some point and then it goes down versus
[05:30] Bitcoin uh versus altcoins. Even though
[05:33] you have a small window in which some of
[05:36] those whatever projects you want to name
[05:38] them shitcoins what we're going to call
[05:39] them they will briefly outperform
[05:41] Bitcoin maybe for a month maybe for 3
[05:43] weeks. It's a gamble to find them. It's
[05:46] impossible to find them. But there is on
[05:48] data. There is even a website called its
[05:50] alcoins season.com or something that
[05:52] shows you on the 90 days how many
[05:54] alcoins are outperform Bitcoin. And
[05:56] there is a few. I think there is five at
[05:58] the moment, but it's just a gamble,
[06:00] right? So I think we we will see alcoin
[06:03] season when that's the million dollar
[06:05] question. I I don't know. That's why
[06:06] Bitcoin is a play, right? Bitcoin is a
[06:08] safe play always. Isn't that I saw the
[06:12] chart but I'm uh I'm currently confused
[06:15] with it. Maybe you can help me a little
[06:18] bit. Don't do that big with Google a
[06:21] lot. But I've seen since I think the the
[06:25] switch from proof of work of proof of
[06:27] stake in Ethereum was somewhere around
[06:30] uh 2022, right?
[06:33] I'm not entirely sure when that
[06:35] happened, but when that happened, it
[06:36] triggered definitely a bunch of uh
[06:40] suspicious slash reaction in investors
[06:42] because that was a that was a 360 going
[06:46] completely on the other way, right? So
[06:48] proof of stake it's um that's something
[06:50] I don't necessarily agree with and also
[06:54] it's far away from central from
[06:56] decentralization is more towards
[06:58] centralization and and it you know there
[07:00] are some projects like Solana for
[07:02] example or XRP they are faster because
[07:04] they're centralized right so it depends
[07:07] on what you need to do um but it feels
[07:10] like there's been a shift in policies
[07:12] there's been more competition for
[07:14] Ethereum I mean 2017 when Ethereum
[07:16] launched There was nothing besides a few
[07:19] projects. Right nowadays, you have so
[07:21] many tokens planning to do what Ethereum
[07:23] wants to do. Plus, Ethereum wants to do
[07:25] way too many things. Not an expert in
[07:27] the matter. I do have a small amount
[07:28] like I told you in my portfolio, but
[07:31] it's it's insignificant, right? Like,
[07:33] it's it's my casino. If it goes to to
[07:35] nothing, I don't care. Bitcoin is where
[07:37] I store my my wealth. But I wasn't I
[07:40] wasn't aware that Ethereum is going to
[07:42] uh crash. I mean it now maybe maybe we
[07:44] should do it uh the other way around to
[07:47] make it if you charge Bitcoin if you
[07:49] charge if you chart uh Bitcoin versus
[07:52] Ethereum or Ethereum versus Bitcoin you
[07:54] would see there is just like a downfall.
[07:56] It's it's the lowest since I think 2018.
[07:59] It's really depressing. It's it's really
[08:01] bad. I mean to be fair everything versus
[08:04] Bitcoin is depressing. XRP, Cardano, but
[08:07] Ethereum in particular I mean not many
[08:10] people would have imagined. I mean
[08:11] unless you are a maxi right and by the
[08:13] way shocker most of the maxi have
[08:15] started buying alcoins right cuz
[08:18] nowadays it's easy to jump in the market
[08:19] in 2020 2021 202 oh everything is a
[08:23] shitcoin yeah but in 2017 it was
[08:25] different man like people were buying
[08:26] alcoins because you you didn't know like
[08:28] it was there was it was a very different
[08:31] space now of course if you jump in and
[08:33] you you read the books there is much
[08:35] more education there is your podcast
[08:36] many other content creators they focus
[08:38] only on Bitcoin it's much easier to be a
[08:40] maxi
[08:41] And by the way, I believe that's my
[08:43] opinion. I mean, at least that that's my
[08:44] experience. You become a maxi because
[08:46] you buy [ __ ] and then you realize that
[08:50] that it doesn't doesn't work well in
[08:52] your portfolio. So, you decide to stay
[08:53] on on the good stuff, right? So, it's a
[08:56] pat. And I think Yeah. Sorry, I just
[09:00] wanted I actually had Ethereum till I
[09:03] think the beginning of 2022. So I think
[09:06] probably like two years before I even
[09:07] started the podcast I went all in
[09:09] Bitcoin. Uh and this was right around
[09:12] the time where the the proof ofstake
[09:14] change happened and ever since that
[09:17] happened Bitcoin is just going up in in
[09:19] in terms of of Ethereum uh since they
[09:22] switched to proof of proof of stake
[09:24] because then you're like oh okay now
[09:26] it's what is it now? We we cannot trust
[09:28] it at all. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have
[09:31] things like Salana. They're saying, "Oh,
[09:32] Salana decentralized." Dude, you need
[09:34] KYC to be to run a node. So, it's not
[09:37] decentralized. There is a lot of
[09:38] misinformation out there. And and
[09:40] there's not many nodes. You have to. So,
[09:42] sorry. You have to be KYC to be a Solana
[09:46] note 100% as well as XRP if you want to
[09:50] I mean depending on the node you want to
[09:51] run, but if you want to run the good
[09:53] node per se, uh they have to vet it. So,
[09:56] at the end of the day, it's super
[09:57] centralized. Then the XRP ledger on the
[09:59] other hand is technically decentralized
[10:02] but there are a lot of things out there
[10:04] right so we have to be careful when we
[10:06] say oh this is decentralized this is
[10:09] centralized I mean the only
[10:10] decentralized asset is Bitcoin
[10:12] everything else is a shitcoin like this
[10:13] is common knowledge right you can go and
[10:16] bury yourself into some technicalities
[10:19] but if you want to run a node of bitcoin
[10:21] you don't need anything you just need to
[10:23] have internet and and some right but if
[10:26] you want to run something else well
[10:28] depending on what it is, it's a
[10:29] different story. I'm not a technician,
[10:31] but I've spoken to a bunch of people and
[10:32] they said, "Look, uh, when it comes to
[10:34] XRP and Salana, that's why they are
[10:36] quote faster because they can they can
[10:38] run their network in a different way."
[10:40] And I think there is a there is a use
[10:42] case out there for those things. Not
[10:44] that I I support them in many ways, but
[10:47] you know, if you think about fiat for
[10:48] example, fiat money or even like
[10:50] centralized finance like your bank
[10:52] account for example, they'll find a use
[10:55] case for it. Like think about the Trump
[10:57] USD1. They launch a stable coin on BNB,
[11:00] right? Of course, they saw how much
[11:03] money Tether is bringing home. They have
[11:05] like what 100 people and they make
[11:06] trillions of dollars a year. So, of
[11:08] course, they want to have their stable
[11:10] coin. So, there's going to be a use
[11:11] case, which sadly is not going to be any
[11:13] good for us. But I like to see the glass
[11:16] half full. So, I believe it's going to
[11:18] help propagate the Bitcoin message,
[11:20] right? Because if you centralize money
[11:22] even more and by the way shocker when
[11:25] people are saying oh CBDC is uh being
[11:27] banned well USDT is a CBDC to a degree
[11:31] right it's it's smart money you can
[11:33] control them USDC is terrible so they
[11:36] already there and now Trump is building
[11:38] his own and as much as I I appreciate
[11:41] everything he's doing for crypto they
[11:42] are making the life for crypto people
[11:45] easier and also for Bitcoiners because
[11:47] for me Bitcoin is not crypto still you
[11:50] know, they have an agenda and they are
[11:52] politicians. So, let's not forget they
[11:54] always lie. So, I don't care about
[11:56] politics much. I just buy Bitcoin as tax
[11:58] s. That's my my religion. But, and I'm
[12:02] I'm happy for everything they're doing
[12:04] in favor of Bitcoin, of course. But, um,
[12:06] Bitcoin doesn't care. In 10 years from
[12:08] now, Camela Camela Harris, Trump, who
[12:10] cares? 10 years, Bitcoin will forget,
[12:12] right? Just Bitcoin does what Bitcoin do
[12:15] and then everything else moves
[12:17] accordingly. And it's a good point
[12:19] because it's like okay CBDC what it
[12:22] doesn't mean central bank digital
[12:24] currency. Yeah. The euro is digital
[12:28] already like for 90% of the time. It's
[12:31] it's digital cash is is not a lot uh in
[12:33] in circum in circulation and it's a
[12:36] central bank currency.
[12:39] So where's where's the difference? Yeah.
[12:41] They have maybe more control over it.
[12:43] they have maybe more uh tight control o
[12:46] over it but it's already a central bank
[12:49] digital currency that we are already
[12:51] using uh it might get worse it probably
[12:54] get worse anyways no matter how they are
[12:56] calling it and the same I look at all
[12:59] the stable coins even look at uh all the
[13:03] altcoins like that I think the only CBDC
[13:07] the only not CBDC is bitcoin that's the
[13:09] only thing that is not controlled by any
[13:11] central uh party and is digital like the
[13:15] only thing that's digital that is not
[13:16] controlled by anyone else. So they are
[13:18] all CBDC's just not Bitcoin. Exactly.
[13:21] And then you have a you have a grade
[13:23] maybe there is lesser of the evil per se
[13:25] like tether they they are nice guys they
[13:27] are bitcoiners I get it but still there
[13:29] is a co there's a company they can put
[13:31] pressure I don't know if you remember I
[13:32] think it was in winter last year Russia
[13:35] and China wanted to do transaction you
[13:36] know we call it the petro dollar because
[13:38] they use dollar to buy petrol and
[13:40] they've done transaction USDT and
[13:41] they've been blocked so you tell me if
[13:44] it's not a CBDC like you can revert
[13:47] transaction you can block transaction so
[13:51] you You know if someone goes to tether
[13:52] and say hey I want you to block that
[13:54] thing they have to bend the knee right
[13:56] whether with bitcoin where do you go
[13:57] nobody nobody technically owns anything
[14:00] I mean okay there is the argument of the
[14:02] nodes and and so forth but nobody owns
[14:04] it there is no CEO there is no company
[14:06] so you can't just whether XRP for
[14:09] example there is two co-founder you can
[14:11] go and you can find them you can point
[14:12] two guns right or you can make an
[14:14] interesting like look at ton the CEO was
[14:17] put in jail and then he's been freed god
[14:19] knows what he agreed to I don't know,
[14:22] but I'm sure they found an agreement,
[14:24] right? And I'm not judging. I'll be
[14:25] probably in the same shoe if they catch
[14:27] me, put me in jail, and they threaten to
[14:29] whatever do to me, I'll say whatever.
[14:31] Okay, let's talk about it like anybody
[14:32] else. So whether with Bitcoin, there's
[14:35] no one you can corner. It's that's why
[14:37] it's it's the only one. And some people
[14:39] think, by the way, that that's a
[14:40] weakness.
[14:42] I found hilarious but cuz they think
[14:44] he's going to come out this Satoshi guy
[14:46] at some point and dump 1 million Bitcoin
[14:50] to us which is hilarious if you ask me.
[14:53] What do you think? Um because I
[14:55] personally don't think that it's even a
[14:57] possibility that he comes back and dumps
[15:00] it like no matter I I just don't think
[15:02] we will ever know who Satoshi Nakamoto
[15:04] really is. But let's make that
[15:06] experiment. Let's say Satoshi Nakamoto
[15:09] actually comes out and actually proves
[15:11] that he can sign the the Bitcoin and the
[15:14] private key and he can actually prove
[15:15] that he holds those keys and he says
[15:18] weird stuff about Bitcoin and he tries
[15:20] to to dump it and all those things. What
[15:22] what do you think will will happen? What
[15:25] is is that a is that a worst case
[15:28] situation for short and medium term?
[15:31] That's a good question. I don't know.
[15:33] First of all, I don't think it's one
[15:34] person. I think it's a group of
[15:35] individuals cuz uh whatever the
[15:37] shenanigans they put together it
[15:39] probably required um the only analogy
[15:41] that shows how old I am. It reminds me
[15:43] of the A team, you know, the the TV
[15:45] series of the 80s where you had the guy
[15:47] with a cigar, honey, you have the pilot,
[15:50] you have I think there's a bunch of
[15:52] people, it's a group, maybe small, and
[15:53] some of them are died. They they they're
[15:55] not with us. They died for sure. But um
[15:58] I think it would be a terrible move
[15:59] because one, the person who's going to
[16:01] come forward is going to put himself or
[16:02] herself in danger cuz I mean, imagine,
[16:05] hey, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto. I'm the guy
[16:08] or the woman who created the most
[16:10] valuable network on Earth. So that would
[16:12] be a stupid move. Second, I don't think
[16:14] they need the money. I mean, I'm sure
[16:16] they mined a ton of Bitcoin. So the 1
[16:19] million Bitcoin in the network is I
[16:21] think it's a bait. I think it's been
[16:23] designed to it's like, hey, it's over
[16:26] there. Go and catch it if you can. Go
[16:27] and crack it. Which, by the way, at some
[16:30] point with quantum computers, maybe that
[16:32] could be in danger. I think that can be
[16:34] cracked if I'm not mistaken. Uh don't
[16:36] quote me here because I'm not a
[16:37] technician, but I've spoken to some
[16:38] people that said, "Hey, that might be in
[16:40] danger." But it's just it's 1 million,
[16:43] right? There's 21 arguably less because
[16:45] some have been lost forever. So I
[16:47] wouldn't worry much about it. Uh if
[16:49] anything, I would worry more about Black
[16:50] Rockck. They are buying stupid amount
[16:52] every day. Like I don't know if you've
[16:54] seen on the news, I was reading an
[16:55] article this morning. In the past week,
[16:58] Black Rockck alone or the ETF well
[17:00] basically Black Rockck mainly because
[17:02] they are the one who buy the most. So
[17:04] the old ETF bought six time the amount
[17:07] has been mined in the network. So at
[17:10] some point the harding is going to kick
[17:11] in and I think that could create an
[17:15] issue and as much as I I'm I'm behind
[17:17] the ETF, I think it's a product that
[17:19] helped us to get to where we are now,
[17:21] not just moneywise, but also awareness,
[17:24] it could create some problems, right?
[17:26] Because they it's not an inkind ETF. So
[17:28] if I do buy the ETF today or tomorrow
[17:30] and I want to sell it, well, they don't
[17:32] have to give me the Bitcoin back. They
[17:33] just give me fiat and they keep the
[17:35] Bitcoin. A sailor with strategy is
[17:38] another major major issue I think
[17:40] because what happens when he steps down
[17:42] what happens when I don't know in 10
[17:44] years from now someone else takes the
[17:47] company and goes this Bitcoin thing I'm
[17:48] done man let's sell it we don't know
[17:50] right so it's always I mean as much as I
[17:53] love seller I'm behind what everything
[17:54] is doing we have seen Jack Moulder now
[17:56] coming up and say 21 is doing the same
[17:58] thing we don't have to and by the way
[18:02] arguably it doesn't even have custody so
[18:04] that's another the Coinbase has the
[18:05] Bitcoin I'm sure you've seen a bunch of
[18:07] memes saying, "Hey, you know, we have
[18:09] sailor Bitcoin." I don't think it's
[18:11] simple as that. But all I'm trying to
[18:13] saying is if you if you walk down the
[18:15] path of the purist, you'll have to have
[18:17] your coin into your own storage. But
[18:20] that wouldn't have taken Bitcoin where
[18:22] it is today. So I think it's a good mix
[18:24] of everything. So the best way that I
[18:28] like to see it is like I don't judge. I
[18:29] don't care. Bitcoin is out, right? And
[18:31] people do whatever they want with it.
[18:33] even on the ordinal inscriptions. I
[18:35] don't care. I I'm for the free market.
[18:38] If people want to do stuff and there is
[18:39] a market for it, who am I to stop it? At
[18:41] the end of the day, we are all
[18:43] interpreting what Bitcoin or Satoshi
[18:45] wanted because he left nine pages into a
[18:48] PDF. So, it's not much. There's a lot of
[18:50] space for interpretation. In fact, we've
[18:51] seen a bunch of forks, right? So, it's
[18:54] an interesting conversation, but um I
[18:57] don't I don't think I would worry much.
[18:59] Um there might be some some who would
[19:01] panic sell cuz nowadays people sell for
[19:04] everything you know Trump loses or
[19:06] something they sell Trump wins they sell
[19:09] something happens they sell on the other
[19:11] hand if a double spending would come in
[19:14] well that would be a a big big big issue
[19:17] right because that means they can revert
[19:19] transactions so that means the network
[19:20] is not secure so that will worry me way
[19:23] more than Satoshi come up and say hey
[19:25] I'm Satoshi which it's very unlikely
[19:29] like a meteor destroying our planet is
[19:31] probably most likely than Satoshi
[19:34] saying, "Hey, I'm I'm I'm back,
[19:37] bros." That's that's how I see it. It's
[19:39] it's very very true. Um you mentioned um
[19:43] strategy and and Black Rockck buying and
[19:45] I think Black Rock you mentioned six
[19:46] times the the amount that was getting
[19:49] mined. It's super interesting for me now
[19:52] to see that there are institutions and
[19:54] they are they I feel like they don't
[19:57] really care about the price. They just
[19:59] want to accumulate Bitcoin and if it's
[20:01] Bitcoin at 70K or 100K or 150K maybe
[20:05] even 200K they don't really care. They
[20:07] just try to accumulate more because they
[20:09] get the hard asset aspect and they get
[20:11] that fear is nothing not worth anything.
[20:14] So with strategy with Tenuan capital
[20:17] with potentially America with Black Rock
[20:20] with a thousand other players that we
[20:23] could name the smaller and bigger ones.
[20:26] Um you also mentioned in the beginning
[20:28] that you kind of see another leg up in
[20:30] in in the Bitcoin cycle. Do you think
[20:32] something like a massive supply shock,
[20:34] something like Samson Ma I think is is
[20:36] famous for saying there's like a omega
[20:39] or God candle, however he calls it
[20:41] coming. Do you think that is kind of
[20:44] where where we are going whenever this
[20:45] this will happen? Yeah, that's a good
[20:48] point. I mean, last time I check with
[20:50] Matt Hogen, the CIO for Bitwise, he said
[20:52] that 70% of the retail, sorry, 70% of
[20:55] the people that are buying ETFs is
[20:57] retail. So, still I think there is a
[20:59] when people saying oh retails is not in
[21:01] no is in it's just into into a different
[21:04] vehicle, right? So, of course, if you
[21:05] are a if you are a degenerate gambler,
[21:07] you're not buying Bitcoin. You're buying
[21:09] whatever memecoin or maybe some other
[21:11] coins cuz you're thinking you're smart
[21:13] and you're going to get hurt. That's why
[21:15] in if you will stick around in a cycle
[21:18] or two, you're going to be a maxi cuz
[21:19] that's inevitable. But,
[21:22] um I think I think we are up for an
[21:25] interesting uh time because yes, the
[21:27] supply shock is going to come. Um the
[21:30] harding usually takes effect a little
[21:32] bit after so it's not immediate like we
[21:34] won't feel it the day that happens
[21:36] actually in fact the day that harding
[21:37] happens nothing happens right it takes
[21:39] some time for the supply to to get to
[21:42] get in place and with those companies
[21:44] we've seen MetaPlanet you know strategy
[21:46] jack and many other companies boule many
[21:49] other people accumulating I think
[21:51] there's going to be a point where now
[21:53] OTC's are going quite hot so you can
[21:55] acquire Bitcoin off the counter we say
[21:58] which means it's not going into effect
[21:59] price because you're buying it
[22:01] privately, but I think those are running
[22:03] short. I've I was checking a metric on
[22:06] the exchanges. I think Coinbase is the
[22:07] lowest in a while. So, it's going to
[22:10] have to impact. And I think some of the
[22:12] companies have started to change the
[22:14] mindset and and buying for the long
[22:16] term. But I think those are still a
[22:18] minority. I think those people like
[22:20] Sailor and maybe you and me or your your
[22:22] viewers, your watchers, it's not the
[22:25] majority. The majority of people, they
[22:26] want to speculate. they want to buy and
[22:27] when they double they want to sell
[22:29] because they don't understand Bitcoin.
[22:30] In fact, I do believe we are still early
[22:33] in that sense, right? Because if you
[22:34] think about market cap, I mean two
[22:36] trillion is nothing. Honestly, it's
[22:38] nothing. So, it's just people look at
[22:40] the price. Oh my god, 100,000 I missed
[22:42] the train. Well, you haven't missed
[22:43] anything. You haven't even started. So,
[22:45] I agree. I think it's difficult to to
[22:48] put a price. Um but uh I think I have in
[22:51] mind some sort of a maybe a little bit
[22:54] short 200,000 180 maybe before the end
[22:57] of the year. Some people are saying the
[22:59] super cycle is going to come in. We will
[23:01] have no more 4year cycle. I don't know.
[23:04] It's hard to say. For now at least the
[23:07] data shows that we are still on track.
[23:08] Uh maybe if things are changing it could
[23:11] and nothing stays the same forever I
[23:13] guess. Even though I would argue there
[23:15] are cycles for everything in life. you
[23:18] know, you have elections and that's
[23:19] probably why we are into the four year
[23:20] cycle. But the supply shock, it will
[23:24] come at some point because whenever
[23:25] we're going to go in certain price
[23:27] points, it could be 120, it could be
[23:29] 150. It will generate FOMO. And I think
[23:32] now that we have the ETF, it it won't be
[23:34] just retail FOMO, it will be
[23:35] institutional FOMO. You will have
[23:37] companies thinking, hey, wait, wait,
[23:38] wait, wait. What if we just do 1%. And
[23:41] that's all we need, right? We don't need
[23:43] many other sailors. We just need people
[23:45] they are playing it more conservative
[23:47] and say hey you know what I have some
[23:48] money on on the balance it's maybe 1%
[23:52] you know if it goes to nothing who cares
[23:54] so I think that's going to be when the
[23:56] second year is going to be put in uh
[23:58] people are calling for a million dollar
[24:00] this cycle I I don't think so I think we
[24:02] will see you and me in our lives a
[24:04] million dollar Bitcoin but not in this
[24:06] cycle and hey I have no crystal ball I'm
[24:08] just speculating I could be completely
[24:10] wrong
[24:10] here and yet everything I have is in
[24:13] Bitcoin because I believe in Bitcoin
[24:14] Right? But not because I want to
[24:15] speculate. I don't care if tomorrow we
[24:17] go up to 120. I I do the math every 20
[24:20] years. So, but it's not everyone, right?
[24:23] Majority of the people have a short term
[24:26] uh kind of mentality, a path of least
[24:29] resistance as Zubie says. So, I kind of
[24:31] I kind of feel it and I understand. And
[24:33] those are people that'll they'll learn
[24:36] their lessons, right? They'll buy
[24:37] Bitcoin at 10,000, sell at 20,000 just
[24:40] to watch it go to 100,000 few years
[24:42] later. seems to be a pattern there.
[24:46] I I don't know if it's a contra it's a
[24:48] if it's a controversial take, but I
[24:50] believe that we already are in a super
[24:53] cycle and everyone that says there's a
[24:55] 4-year cycle is probably too focused and
[24:59] zoomed in on the price movements. Uh if
[25:02] you look at 2009 till now, what is it?
[25:05] 16 years, 17 years, like it's not a long
[25:08] time. This is the super cycle. Bitcoin
[25:10] is in a super cycle since 2010. And
[25:13] yeah, it is volatile. There there might
[25:15] be a four year cycle, but I don't care
[25:17] about who who buys an asset for four
[25:20] years. I I I always look out what what's
[25:23] the long-term vision for 10 two for 10,
[25:26] 20, 30 years. What's a decade long
[25:29] vision? How will Bitcoin look if I'm
[25:32] dead and my son has a great great
[25:35] grandson? Like like how does Bitcoin
[25:37] look in 200 years? I know people always
[25:40] say, "Yeah, but I will be dead by then."
[25:42] and oh I I want to retire in the next 5
[25:44] years. Yeah. Like okay then then you
[25:46] have a different time zone but you have
[25:48] no clue what happens with Bitcoin in in
[25:50] in 2 three four five years like we can
[25:53] guess maybe it will be at the half a
[25:55] million maybe at like 10 million like
[25:57] who like nobody knows. I know it will be
[26:00] uh way bigger than anything else on
[26:04] earth
[26:05] combined that in 50 years but like who
[26:10] cares about that? Like that's why I'm
[26:11] always saying like we are already in a
[26:13] in a super cycle. Yeah, that's a super
[26:16] good point. I guess it depends on the
[26:17] definition. In my mind when I say super
[26:20] cycle, I mean those four-ear cycles in
[26:22] which we have a bull run and a bare
[26:24] market, right? Uh which could be very
[26:27] well changed like now we have different
[26:29] players even just with the ETF alone uh
[26:32] they will keep buying consistently every
[26:34] whatever week, day, month. So that could
[26:37] change and I don't think there is an
[26:38] asset who has kept the volatility since
[26:42] the day one. So the more the asset will
[26:44] get propagated and and you know well
[26:46] known the less will be volatile. Look at
[26:48] gold. Gold gold is barely moving like 2%
[26:50] is a huge move. Why? Because it's been
[26:52] around for hundreds of years and people
[26:55] are you know that they treat it with a
[26:57] different mindset. So I think I think we
[26:59] will see a diminishing in either way. So
[27:01] we won't see those stupid rally but I
[27:04] don't think we'll see an 80% correction
[27:06] either. Right? So I agree. So in that
[27:09] sense I think the four years could be
[27:11] could be challenged. Um having said that
[27:14] I do believe we will see another leg up
[27:16] and we will see another correction cuz
[27:18] um there's going to be people they will
[27:20] play the short end. I'm with you. I
[27:23] invest which means I have a 10 years
[27:24] plus mindset but not everyone has the
[27:27] same mindset. Some people want wanted a
[27:29] shortterm play. Maybe they'll double
[27:31] their money and they want to they want
[27:32] to get out. Or maybe someone who's gone
[27:34] in at 108, they want to oh my god,
[27:36] please go back to 100 so they can exit.
[27:38] You know, we've seen it before the cycle
[27:40] before we touch 69 or 70 depending on
[27:43] the exchange. And as soon as we hit 69,
[27:46] some people took profit because they
[27:47] wanted to get rid of their bitcoins,
[27:49] right? I mean, if you ask me, it's
[27:51] because they don't understand it or they
[27:52] haven't study enough. But hey, not
[27:54] everyone has the same preferences. There
[27:56] is people they want gold, they want real
[27:59] estate. Uh there is a lot of people I
[28:01] know in Dubai, they've been selling a
[28:03] lot at 100,000. And those people have
[28:05] been around for quite a bit. And hey,
[28:07] who am I to judge if they went in at
[28:09] $100 and the asset has gone to, I don't
[28:12] know, $100,000. If they want to sell it,
[28:15] please be my guest. You know, like at
[28:17] the end of the day, their money, their
[28:18] choice. So they decided what to do with
[28:20] it.
[28:22] The question I I have in my head is why
[28:24] am I selling for right? I mean there is
[28:26] an interesting topic which we can go
[28:28] into it if you want which is why I think
[28:30] you should sell your Bitcoin but that's
[28:31] a separate conversation. If you are
[28:33] plugged in like me if you have nothing
[28:35] else but Bitcoin well you have no other
[28:36] option. But if you have a job if you
[28:38] have a normal job who pays you in fiat
[28:40] dollars euros pounds whatever pesos
[28:43] whatever you you accumulate and you have
[28:46] everything around you is quote normal
[28:48] but you don't sell your Bitcoin. Of
[28:50] course not. Why would you sell it for to
[28:52] kept money on the bank account or to buy
[28:54] a property which is not yours or to to
[28:57] do what? But on the other hand, if you
[28:58] live in the Bitcoin standard and Bitcoin
[29:00] is everything you have, well, you have
[29:03] no other option, right? And then the
[29:05] second thing is well, when do you sell
[29:06] then? Because if you only sell when you
[29:09] need, it's not financially responsible,
[29:13] I think, because imagine if you were
[29:14] sold at 15,000 as opposed to selling
[29:16] today at 94,000. So you might want to be
[29:19] aware of these movements, right? So then
[29:22] it becomes a rabbit hole, then you
[29:24] become a trader. No, I don't want to
[29:25] trade. I just want to be smart with my
[29:27] asset. It's a that's an interesting
[29:29] topic. And sometimes when I speak to
[29:31] people, there is three type of uh
[29:33] persona I have usually one which is like
[29:36] the no I don't care. I don't care about
[29:39] the price. When I need money to do
[29:40] something, I sell. Well, money is
[29:42] Bitcoin. When I need fiat to pay rent,
[29:44] for example, I sell. I don't care if I
[29:46] sell a bitcoin is a 20k halas doesn't
[29:50] matter if I sell a bitcoin at 90k I
[29:52] don't care then you have another type
[29:55] which is like they try to top the bottom
[29:57] at the at the top which is impossible no
[29:59] one can and those are the trader type
[30:01] and then you have someone like me
[30:02] somewhere in between where I am trying
[30:04] to be strategic even though I don't try
[30:06] to time anything but I do know that now
[30:08] is $94,000 so I have to be aware I have
[30:12] to take a portion of my portfolio and
[30:13] say hey with this amount
[30:15] I have to be strategic for the next four
[30:17] years, right? Or next two years or I
[30:19] have to plan my finances because if I
[30:21] don't, I could take a severe heat
[30:24] financially because I'm going to have to
[30:25] sell when I have to, not when I want to.
[30:29] And that comes with any other I guess if
[30:32] you have money in your bank account,
[30:33] right? You have to be some sort of a
[30:35] financial aware of your lifestyle.
[30:38] You'll be surprised how many people they
[30:39] don't even know how much their life
[30:40] cost. So, how much how much does it cost
[30:42] you to stay alive today? Oh, I don't
[30:45] know. Well, you should, I think, because
[30:46] otherwise, how can you be financially
[30:48] free if you don't have an idea of your
[30:49] expenses, of your all your income,
[30:51] right? How much is rent? How much did
[30:53] you pay? I'm not saying to go full Excel
[30:56] crazy serial killer tracking everything.
[30:59] But you should have an idea, I think,
[31:00] right? To make sure you can afford your
[31:03] lifestyle, to make sure you can go on
[31:05] holiday. But that's a that's a more kind
[31:08] of financial I think that something
[31:10] Bitcoin could teach, by the way. uh it
[31:12] will teach you how to be financially
[31:14] aware. I guess I don't know if it makes
[31:16] sense. I'm rambling, but I guess that's
[31:18] uh that's something I'm always trying to
[31:19] be aware of. Hey, how you know when when
[31:23] it's convenient for me to sell to pay
[31:25] rent? Do I pay once a year? Do I sell
[31:28] once a month? Does it make sense what
[31:31] I'm saying?
[31:32] There are three really interesting
[31:35] topics in there that you just said and
[31:37] and I just want to make sure we get to
[31:39] all three of them without me um missing
[31:41] one. The first one that you just
[31:43] mentioned um where I want to get to and
[31:45] why you should measure your wealth not
[31:48] in euros, not in Bitcoin, but in time. I
[31:52] explain what I mean by that. The the the
[31:54] second one is and we talked about it
[31:56] before recording uh and I talked with
[31:59] that with Jeff Booth and and he is
[32:02] famous for saying if Bitcoin fails as a
[32:04] medium of exchange it will also fail as
[32:06] a store of value. So I want to get to
[32:08] that and then uh the last one I want to
[32:11] get to is kind of um uh the the money
[32:15] behavior of Bitcoiners and hoing and and
[32:18] and dying rich and living poor kind of
[32:20] uh kind of a thing. But let's start with
[32:23] the first one. You should measure your
[32:26] wealth in in in time. I love that so
[32:29] much. Um, and I I I did I do that every
[32:32] now and then. It's it's kind of hard to
[32:34] do because you have to kind of calculate
[32:36] what's your life cost like what what do
[32:38] you need as a running cost per month on
[32:41] like on on without luxury payment. Um,
[32:45] plus a little bit of a buffer for, hey,
[32:47] maybe you want to move and you have to
[32:49] buy furniture or like whatever comes up.
[32:52] Um, and what's your net worth? How how
[32:56] many Bitcoin do you have? How long with
[32:59] the current uh value of Bitcoin could
[33:01] you survive without getting any income?
[33:05] Uh,
[33:06] and maybe that's controversial in the
[33:08] Bitcoin sphere, but I actually would go
[33:10] ahead and not measure my wealth in
[33:13] Bitcoin. rather I would measure it in
[33:16] time. How many months, how many years,
[33:19] how many decades depending on how
[33:21] wealthy you are do I have without h how
[33:26] long could I lay on the couch and watch
[33:27] net watch Netflix for like that's
[33:30] basically the measurement I'm using. Not
[33:32] not testing you should do that but
[33:35] that's the kind of the measurement I
[33:36] would go in. Yeah, that's such a good
[33:38] point. And uh I usually think in a in a
[33:41] similar way, which is okay, I have 24
[33:43] hours on a day. How many of those hours
[33:46] I do stuff I want versus stuff I need
[33:48] to? For example, if you have a job, you
[33:50] go to work. Okay, do you want to go to
[33:52] work? Well, I guess the answer is yes,
[33:54] because you have to have a purpose. But
[33:56] is is your work the job you want? That's
[33:59] the million-dollar question. And you'd
[34:01] be surprised how many people I've spoken
[34:03] to and they said, "Oh, I hate my job."
[34:04] Well, then okay, that's then if you are
[34:08] someone who makes a million dollar a
[34:09] month, but he hates his his or her job
[34:11] and he's trapped, he doesn't even have
[34:13] time to see his kids. Well, that's not
[34:15] financial freedom to me. That's like
[34:18] slavery right there. Cuz if you stop to
[34:20] go and perform your job, you can't even
[34:23] afford your items, your lifestyle, your
[34:25] your home, your cars. So that's that's a
[34:28] big a big thing. And like you said, I
[34:30] think if you think in terms of time,
[34:32] which is the most scarce asset we have.
[34:34] I also agree. But then then how can you
[34:37] design a lifestyle around things that
[34:39] you enjoy doing? And then shocker, you
[34:42] won't even feel you're working because
[34:43] you are like what we are doing now. I
[34:45] don't feel I'm working cuz I'm loving
[34:46] talking to you. So I have chosen this
[34:48] morning. I woke up and I said today I'm
[34:50] going to talk to Robin. So and people
[34:52] call us lucky. Well, that's one way to
[34:54] define it. Yes. uh but nobody came to
[34:57] your house or my house and said hey you
[34:59] guys one day are going to bump into each
[35:01] other we built something and we
[35:04] gravitate towards each other and there
[35:05] is a definition I love which says luck
[35:07] is truly when preparation meets
[35:08] opportunity right if you are prepared
[35:11] you will meet an opportunity then you
[35:12] will be called lucky so I I think 100%
[35:15] like you said if you if you plan your
[35:17] life around things you enjoy doing it's
[35:20] like what is it I like to do okay I like
[35:22] to talk to people perfect how can I how
[35:24] can I do that and how can I make money
[35:26] while doing that then things are going
[35:28] to start form and I think one of the
[35:31] common mistake is people think too much
[35:33] about the how just focus on the why you
[35:36] know the how is going to how is going to
[35:38] come if you truly want something you'll
[35:40] find a way to do it right and you don't
[35:42] even know because it's going to be I
[35:43] call it unconscious competence so you
[35:45] don't even know you have it but you have
[35:46] it and you you behave as if it happens
[35:50] so I think that's a that's a fantastic
[35:51] point and think in terms of how much um
[35:54] how how much I can do on a daily base
[35:57] without depending on on my fiat job or
[35:59] or or whatever it might be. And and like
[36:02] you said, it's a it's a good metric, but
[36:04] many people would fail
[36:06] in simply tracking down expenses. You'll
[36:09] be surprised how many people I know a
[36:11] lot of people with a lot of money and
[36:13] some of them are terrible in managing.
[36:14] They don't care. And you know, and some
[36:17] of them have the same problem, but in
[36:18] the opposite spectrum, they are super
[36:20] poor and they don't care because they
[36:21] think, "Oh, there's nothing I can do.
[36:23] I'm poor anyway, right? And you'll be
[36:26] surprised how much you can do if you
[36:27] want to put your time and energy into
[36:31] it. That's a it's a really really really
[36:34] good point. On that note, how how do you
[36:38] define retirement? Would you consider
[36:40] yourself retired?
[36:42] I guess so. I mean, I I guess I'm doing
[36:44] what I love every day. Um I did try and
[36:47] do nothing on the beach and it was
[36:48] terrible. Um, I mean it's good for a
[36:50] week, but I think if you don't have any
[36:53] purpose in life, that's a that's a sad
[36:55] life. And and it's okay not not knowing
[36:58] what you want to do like, you know, it's
[37:00] fine. Actually, I believe not knowing
[37:02] what to do is a beautiful place to be
[37:03] because you can try everything. Now, the
[37:06] the challenge is finding something that
[37:09] is going to make you happy and is going
[37:10] to depending on the type of person you
[37:13] are. For example, I like to I like make
[37:15] money in business, but not because I
[37:17] like money. Um, of course, I mean,
[37:19] everyone loves having an income and and
[37:22] being successful, but it's the hustle,
[37:24] you know, it's like creating something
[37:26] from from nothing, from an idea. It
[37:28] could be a restaurant, could be a
[37:30] podcast, could be anything, you name it.
[37:33] Getting throughout the journey and going
[37:36] through the struggle, that's the best
[37:37] part, you know. Then when you get the
[37:39] medal and you win, well, you want to
[37:40] start something else. I mean, at least
[37:42] that's my profile. So, I guess I am I
[37:45] mean, I live in Dubai. I I do what I
[37:47] love. I choose every day to do what I
[37:49] do, which is I guess it could be defined
[37:51] as um retirement, but I don't think I
[37:54] will ever retire cuz um I mean depending
[37:57] on the definition of retirement, but if
[37:59] you if you ask a bunch of random people
[38:01] on the road on the street, hey, what
[38:02] does it mean to be retired? What it
[38:04] means you're getting paid by the state
[38:06] to do nothing, right? And that's
[38:08] terrible. I think that's the most
[38:10] depressing thing ever cuz uh I don't
[38:13] want to depend on anyone to begin with.
[38:15] I want to be independent. Number two,
[38:18] how how sad that could be. Like I want
[38:20] to have a purpose. I want to have a
[38:22] mission, right? And think about sailor
[38:24] for example, he could very much stop
[38:26] doing everything and just sipping
[38:28] cocktail on a yacht. But he doesn't do
[38:30] that either cuz um and not everyone is
[38:33] like me by the way. Everyone has his own
[38:35] way and I respect everything. And I
[38:37] think as long as you are in peace with
[38:39] yourself, there's a lot of people I know
[38:41] they are retired and they they still go
[38:42] to work, right? um because they they
[38:45] feel like they they want to. So as long
[38:47] as you are in balance with yourself. I
[38:50] guess my definition of retirement would
[38:51] be being financially free or independent
[38:54] and not depending on your boss or or the
[38:58] state or a pension or any external
[39:01] sources could be a son or a wife or a
[39:04] husband whatever and do what you love.
[39:06] So if you can manage to do these things
[39:08] at the age of 50 like I am well then
[39:11] good. If you manage to do it at 20,
[39:13] great. If you manage to do it at 70,
[39:15] awesome. You know, everyone has his own
[39:17] path, I guess. I'm always shocked when
[39:20] you tell me your your age. I'm like,
[39:22] he's just 25 years old. I wish that
[39:25] would be sweet. I'll take it. I I love
[39:28] to be 25, even though I'll probably be
[39:30] extremely irresponsible, but hey, I've
[39:32] been there, so it's okay. I'm like, I
[39:36] want to have your skin and and your your
[39:38] your uh how do you say it? your your oh
[39:42] gosh, how do you say when when you just
[39:45] like how you look uh your your face and
[39:48] your your looks with 50 years old. Like
[39:50] that's that's amazing. You you really
[39:51] look like young. Thank you. As as the
[39:54] cap who hides a lot of I I started to
[39:56] see a lot of white hair popping in
[39:58] lately. It must be the price of
[40:00] Bitcoin. Stresses me out. I want to I
[40:03] want to see a picture where you're
[40:05] actually 25. You you have to send it to
[40:08] me. I I think that would be really fun
[40:09] for me to to see the the difference
[40:11] because I've also seen you in in real
[40:13] life in in Abu Dhabi and you also look
[40:15] in real life, not old. Like you you look
[40:17] young there. So sorry for the small
[40:19] detour, but I think you have to share
[40:21] with the audience your uh youth uh
[40:24] secrets. Dude, I I have some photos when
[40:26] I was like 17. You wouldn't believe it's
[40:28] me. Super long hair like look like a
[40:30] girl. I got guys hitting on me cuz I had
[40:32] a I look like my mom. And now with the
[40:34] beer, it doesn't happen. Thank god. But
[40:37] I've gone through my phase. I was
[40:39] playing guitar into a rock band. So
[40:41] yeah, I'll send you some photos. You
[40:42] won't believe me, but I'll I'll send
[40:44] some for sure. I got I only got hit on
[40:47] once by a guy. Uh but he was gay. Okay.
[40:50] Well, maybe it's still a compliment,
[40:52] right? It's still a compliment. I took
[40:54] it like I I loved on on on this day. I
[40:57] was flying so high because never like as
[41:00] a guy, I don't know about you, but I
[41:02] never get hit on. Uh maybe I'm not
[41:04] attractive enough, but uh this was the
[41:06] one time where I got hit on and I was
[41:08] like I'm I'm the king of the world. So
[41:11] unfortunately I was not gay. But uh I I
[41:12] I love the compliment of his. Yeah. Next
[41:15] time you have a fight with your
[41:16] girlfriend, hopefully never, you can
[41:17] say, "Hey, careful cuz I have options."
[41:19] You
[41:21] know, but yeah, I know what you mean. I
[41:24] have one other option. I saw him five
[41:26] years ago.
[41:29] You never know. Yeah, I I wanted to
[41:32] bring uh a little bit back to work. Uh
[41:35] and a personal story. I was last week in
[41:38] Albania to make I think the first real
[41:41] holiday I took since I started the
[41:43] podcast and uh it was interesting
[41:47] because I really wanted to go back to
[41:49] the hotel room and work. I I took my
[41:52] laptop with me and yes, we were on the
[41:54] beach. We were driving around to
[41:55] different cities, doing sightseeing, uh
[41:58] going out to really nice restaurants,
[42:00] like all the things. We really lived
[42:01] life there. But I really looked forward
[42:04] to the time where my girlfriend got
[42:07] ready in the hotel room because it took
[42:08] like uh way longer than it takes me. And
[42:11] in that time, I could work and it was
[42:13] like, yes, nice. I I can get to it. So,
[42:16] uh I I really have that feeling that I
[42:18] really want to work. Uh I I'm still in
[42:21] the place where I have to work. I'm not
[42:23] retired. I don't have like 100 bitcoin
[42:24] laying around, but uh I I really also
[42:28] want to work. Uh so I I don't know if
[42:30] this is already retirement if you love
[42:32] what you're doing and you can do that
[42:34] every day. Um but I would I would define
[42:37] it like that. Yeah, that's a good point.
[42:40] I mean, it is super important. I'm
[42:42] telling this to myself, by the way. I'm
[42:43] not telling this to you or to your
[42:44] audience. I'm telling this to me. I
[42:46] think it's super important to have some
[42:49] time for you and your partner. like my
[42:52] wife, how many times I do it? We go
[42:54] somewhere and I work, right? Or I'm on
[42:57] the plane and I'm editing videos or I'm
[42:59] sending emails to guests or whatever.
[43:01] I'm talking to my business partner in
[43:02] Dubai. Like I always do that and um as
[43:05] much as she is an incredible woman cuz
[43:06] she deals with me every day. I think we
[43:09] own them to you know give them our time
[43:11] and be focused with them. I do struggle
[43:14] a lot. I mean like you I there's no
[43:17] place there is no way there's no
[43:18] scenario in which I am not doing my
[43:20] thing for more than 20 minutes. It might
[43:22] be a WhatsApp thing or or a message on
[43:25] Twitter whatever it might be. I struggle
[43:28] um which is a good thing but also it's a
[43:30] bad thing. It's a good thing because it
[43:32] means we are enjoying what we are doing
[43:34] but it's a bad thing I think because we
[43:36] I think we should maybe balance it a
[43:39] little bit more. Um, and even though I I
[43:41] love my life and I'm very happy where I
[43:44] am with everything around me, there's
[43:48] always room for improvement, right? So,
[43:51] specifically when you are on vacation
[43:52] and I've done it so many times and my
[43:55] wife sees me packing, oh, you're taking
[43:56] your camera with you, you're taking your
[43:57] laptop with you and I'm like, yeah,
[43:59] well, you never know, maybe something's
[44:01] going to come up and she roll her eyes
[44:03] saying, oh my god, you know, and and I
[44:05] think we do own them to just unplug a
[44:08] little bit.
[44:09] Uh but also like I said it's a good
[44:11] sign. It means you are enjoying what you
[44:14] do right so as long as we balance it
[44:16] somewhat uh I think Kevin Olirri said it
[44:19] once in a video he said plan your week
[44:22] as you wish it is going to be. So for
[44:25] example, you take a a piece of paper and
[44:27] you say, "Okay, Monday, Tuesday,
[44:28] Wednesday, day, all the days of the
[44:29] week." And you go from 8:00 to 9:00, I
[44:31] want to do this, 9 to 10, I want to do
[44:32] this, blah blah blah. And then Saturday
[44:34] or Sunday, you pick one day at least
[44:36] where you do dedicate yourself to your
[44:40] partner. Uh not just because of them,
[44:42] but also because of you because you have
[44:44] to kind of pull the plugs, right? And I
[44:47] know when you work for yourself, it's
[44:48] impossible to plug to to just like
[44:51] disconnect because there is always a
[44:53] message. And by the way, I work with a
[44:55] lot of people, they they're like me and
[44:57] you. So there is no Sunday. I mean, what
[44:59] is Sunday? I don't have any there is no
[45:02] difference. By the way, fun fact, when I
[45:03] landed in Dubai, Sunday was a working
[45:06] day, right? They had Saturday and Friday
[45:08] off. So the old thing, ever since I came
[45:10] here, I don't even know what a Sunday is
[45:12] anymore. Even though now it's
[45:13] technically Monday to Friday, still I'm
[45:15] surrounded by entrepreneurs. So there is
[45:18] no in my network I don't have anyone who
[45:20] does 9 to5 Monday to Friday. So even if
[45:23] I want to and even if I shut down my
[45:26] phone or if I lose my phone, believe me,
[45:28] they'll find a way to text me through
[45:30] someone the hotel reception or my wife
[45:33] phone or whatever. But that's not
[45:36] healthy, right? So we have to try at
[45:38] least to design a life. And I get it.
[45:42] Maybe it's just maybe a good analogy is
[45:44] when the plane takes off, there's a lot
[45:45] of pressure in the beginning, right? Ah,
[45:48] and then when you are in the
[45:50] whatever atmosphere, then you are
[45:53] chilling. I was like, okay, now I can.
[45:54] And I think me and you are in that phase
[45:56] where we're kind of trying, you know,
[45:59] but at some point I think we'll have to
[46:01] cool the engine and enjoy the ride maybe
[46:03] a little bit more. Uh, or at least
[46:06] that's how I like to tell myself because
[46:07] I've been in that phase for 50 years. So
[46:10] maybe maybe it's his longest take off
[46:13] ever, but I think at some point has to
[46:15] come, right? I don't know. Let's take a
[46:17] break for a moment and appreciate the
[46:20] beauty that coin vigilante has made with
[46:23] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[46:26] the most amazing, the most eleigent way
[46:28] of showing that you are a true
[46:31] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[46:34] dropped a completely new and amazing
[46:36] Genesis edition of their watch
[46:39] collections. You have the date of the
[46:41] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[46:45] and of course also the block height and
[46:47] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[46:50] the level of detail they put in in this
[46:53] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[46:55] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[46:59] down in the descriptions. I love those
[47:01] watches. so so much. And now if you have
[47:04] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[47:07] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[47:09] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[47:11] to deal with that. The first way is you
[47:13] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[47:15] entry for you to get into the
[47:18] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[47:21] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[47:24] super simple and secure way. And if you
[47:27] check out the link in the description,
[47:29] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[47:32] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[47:35] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[47:38] partner in terms of how to get the most
[47:41] out of your sovereignty. They will
[47:43] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[47:46] that is perfect for your individual
[47:49] situation. They will show you how you
[47:52] can secure your own devices. Securing
[47:54] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[47:56] have to keep all your devices secure.
[47:59] One topic that is overlooked often is
[48:01] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[48:04] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[48:07] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[48:09] place already? And last but not least,
[48:11] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[48:13] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[48:16] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[48:21] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[48:23] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[48:26] will be for the first time ever speaking
[48:29] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[48:32] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[48:34] really looking forward to seeing all of
[48:36] you there. You can get your ticket in
[48:39] the link down in the description of
[48:41] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[48:43] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[48:47] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[48:49] there. My take off still takes uh 24
[48:52] years till I'm 50. Well, you never know.
[48:54] You never know. But, uh, there's there's
[48:58] maybe some small snippet in there like
[49:00] because I started not taking my phone
[49:05] with me. If I want to have time with my
[49:08] girl and she has her phone, we can call
[49:11] an emergency there. Like, it it's okay.
[49:14] In an real emergency, I could even log
[49:16] in with my things on her phones and
[49:17] stuff like that. Uh, but uh that never
[49:21] happens. So, and mostly we take one
[49:24] phone just for like maps and and and
[49:27] paying things because we usually have it
[49:29] on the phone. And it's it's really
[49:32] freeing if you don't even have your
[49:33] phone with you. Just like you have a
[49:35] key, you have a wallet. Like what else
[49:37] do you need if you want to spend time
[49:39] with someone else? Uh it doesn't even
[49:41] have to be uh your wife or girlfriend or
[49:45] your partner. It can just totally be a
[49:46] friend. Like if you want to really go
[49:48] deep with a friend and and you want
[49:49] like, "Hey, let's let's spend a a
[49:51] weekend and and have have fun and and
[49:53] play games and and and maybe um write a
[49:56] book together, like whatever you want to
[49:58] do." Um leave your phone behind like
[50:02] lock it away. Uh and the laptop is
[50:04] another level.
[50:06] Like the the laptop shouldn't even be at
[50:09] the restaurant.
[50:10] Yeah. Uh but but the phone is also I
[50:14] think even people that are not crazy
[50:17] about work. I think even they are guilty
[50:20] of taking the phone with them too much
[50:22] and looking at the phone too much. Maybe
[50:25] it's not work. Sometimes maybe it is
[50:27] still work but maybe it's another friend
[50:30] that is like oh like you you can leave
[50:32] that conversation for when you have time
[50:34] with your phone and be present at at
[50:37] that very moment.
[50:39] That's a super good point. I I did uh
[50:42] made a lot of changes lately in the past
[50:44] maybe three or four months and I now I'm
[50:47] now extremely selective whenever I go
[50:50] out for lunch or I spend time with
[50:52] someone. Uh shout out to Zubie by the
[50:54] way. He's probably one of the few as
[50:57] well as British. There's a bunch of
[50:58] people I see in Dubai regularly and
[51:00] whenever we see each other with the
[51:01] phones stay in the pocket otherwise
[51:03] what's the point? Like if you if I
[51:04] invite you for lunch and it's me me you
[51:06] and the phones it's like why why are we
[51:09] doing this right and there's a lot of
[51:11] people they they forget and I think it's
[51:14] going to be a
[51:15] problem especially in this generation
[51:17] who was going to raise kids and they're
[51:18] going to feed their kids iPad and
[51:21] iPhones so they stop crying and they
[51:23] play games so when they grow up I mean
[51:24] my father would slap the life out of me
[51:27] if I would invite a lady for lunch and
[51:29] check my phone all all the time you know
[51:31] I couldn't even watch TV while dinner
[51:33] was I mean this was the ' 80s '7s but
[51:36] it's different story right and I think
[51:38] parents are forgetting not all of them
[51:39] some are doing a fantastic job but the
[51:42] majority of the people I see just go to
[51:44] any restaurant look around you see
[51:45] couples on their phones right so that's
[51:48] a super good point and I think it comes
[51:50] back to the big coiner profile right I
[51:53] think whenever someone says to you I I'm
[51:55] a Bitcoiner it says a lot about your
[51:57] lifestyle I mean there are I think we
[52:00] discussed it last time briefly beside
[52:02] the fact that I'm vegetarian and and I
[52:03] don't I don't believe in Jesus
[52:04] necessarily. Those are the two things
[52:06] that most of the big convers have like
[52:08] faith in in religion and like a very
[52:11] meat uh kind of diet. But besides those
[52:15] two things I I don't have there is a lot
[52:17] of signals right they are telling you
[52:19] they are aware they're telling you there
[52:21] are many things I mean depending on how
[52:22] much they're plugged in but if you speak
[52:24] to like proper Bitcoin they're not
[52:26] someone who wants to gamble to buy a
[52:28] Lamborghini those are I'm not talking to
[52:30] those people I'm talking to the ones
[52:31] like you and me and your audience right
[52:33] people they believe they study they're
[52:35] reading they're listening to the good
[52:37] podcast I think there is a lot you say
[52:39] when you say I'm a Bitcoiner right and
[52:42] then you have a you have someone like me
[52:43] who has small percentage of my portfolio
[52:45] and sometimes I gamble and people call
[52:46] me [ __ ] coiner bitcoin bitcoiner call me
[52:49] a so if you are fun fact if you are a
[52:52] bitcoiner I'm the shitcoiner if you are
[52:54] a [ __ ] coiner I'm the maxi so I I'm
[52:56] getting [ __ ] from all the sides right
[52:58] whether in fact I am of course I'm a
[53:00] bitcoiner but just because I have just
[53:02] because I go to the casino on the
[53:04] weekend and I gamble with some money
[53:06] that I don't care to lose that doesn't
[53:09] make me less of a bitcoiner but the
[53:11] definition is very areas right there is
[53:14] Bitcoiners pro ordininals there is
[53:16] Bitcoiner against ordinals there
[53:18] is people deciding what to do with their
[53:21] money I guess
[53:23] right I I I try to make definitions as
[53:27] simple as possible so for me a bitcoiner
[53:30] is someone who has bitcoin
[53:33] like end of
[53:36] story you you maybe are not aligned with
[53:40] the bitcoin values but you're still a
[53:43] Bitcoin. If you have Bitcoin, if if if
[53:45] you are an ex user and using the the
[53:48] Twitter platform or X platform, it
[53:52] doesn't matter how many followers you
[53:53] have, how many how much you post on
[53:56] there, you are a user of that platform.
[53:59] And the same with Bitcoin. If you are uh
[54:01] using the network for transacting, for
[54:04] storing value of like however you use
[54:06] it, you are a user of Bitcoin.
[54:08] Therefore, you are a bitcoinire. Uh then
[54:12] it gets tricky with the definition of a
[54:14] Bitcoin maxi. Um I just I just try to
[54:18] have the definition of a Bitcoin maxi
[54:21] someone who has a vast majority of his
[54:24] wealth in
[54:25] Bitcoin, but it's never connected to
[54:28] what he like a Bitcoin maxi can be a
[54:31] vegan. Like that's possible. I've seen
[54:34] them like there are a lot of them
[54:36] actually. Um, a Bitcoin maxi can also be
[54:40] out of shape. Not everyone is working
[54:42] out seven times a week. H a Bitcoin maxi
[54:46] can also not believe in Jesus Christ.
[54:49] They they can also not believe in any
[54:50] gods. So, so just because most of them
[54:55] or the average Bitcoin maxi is believing
[54:57] in those things doesn't mean that all of
[54:58] them have to. And what we are, I think,
[55:01] doing is we projecting our values onto
[55:05] Bitcoin and thinking everyone has to
[55:07] have the same values as as we which is
[55:10] an absurd thing to do. Like why why the
[55:13] heck are we doing that? Yeah, that's a
[55:15] really good point. But um it seems like
[55:18] there are subgroups or subcategories or
[55:20] whatever you want to label them. And
[55:22] it's interesting not just in Bitcoin, by
[55:23] the way. It's it's it's in anything
[55:25] else, right? So you tend to form groups
[55:28] and and things happens. Um but it's
[55:31] interesting how the the phenomenon has
[55:33] changed at least in in a few years. Um
[55:36] I've seen comments on on friends of
[55:38] mine. Maybe they bought a nice watch or
[55:40] something. Oh no, if you don't you don't
[55:42] buy a bit whatever you buy a Kazio $10
[55:45] watch or or you're supposed to have
[55:47] broken socks and broken underwear. I I
[55:50] think there is a nice balance in between
[55:52] and I think your your wealth should
[55:54] reflect your lifestyle. Right. Going
[55:55] back to what you said earlier, I think
[55:57] if you are someone who's made uh enough
[56:00] good choices, aka buying Bitcoin maybe a
[56:03] while back or in 10 years from now,
[56:05] buying Bitcoin in 2025. Yeah, for sure.
[56:08] And your your wealth grows, I think you
[56:11] owe to yourself to have a better
[56:13] lifestyle, right? I'm not saying to go
[56:15] out and splash cash and doing, but do
[56:18] whatever, you know, treat yourself. You
[56:19] know, at the end of the day, there is no
[56:21] harm in in making your life more
[56:23] comfortable in in living in a in a
[56:25] better house. You know, maybe do like
[56:27] you said earlier, treat your time as the
[56:29] most scarce asset and question yourself,
[56:32] am I happy? You know, am I doing with my
[56:35] time what I want to do? I had a
[56:37] beautiful chat with Bob last week and
[56:39] brunette and he said, um, we we had a
[56:42] bunch of different conversation.
[56:43] Exactly. There you
[56:45] go. That sounds it right. But but it's
[56:48] the same thing and and sometimes we
[56:51] forget about the basic right. I mean,
[56:53] it's good to put yourself into a path.
[56:56] Give yourself goals. But don't forget
[56:58] to, you know, trade yourself. Otherwise,
[57:00] what's the point in dying with a,000
[57:02] bitcoin if you don't spend any in
[57:04] improving your life? Also, the people
[57:06] you love, right? Your wife, your
[57:08] husband, your kids, your parents,
[57:11] whatever people they your friends,
[57:12] right? So, I think it's a good balance
[57:14] there. And it's okay to be obsessed in
[57:16] the beginning to grab as many as you can
[57:19] as long as you know you are into a phase
[57:21] if it makes sense. Just don't let that
[57:23] phase become your life. That's what I
[57:25] would say.
[57:27] That's a perfect um transition in the
[57:30] third like we we had this three topics
[57:32] and the uh the the third one was kind of
[57:36] exactly that dying rich living poor. So
[57:40] for the people that might not uh watch
[57:42] but just listen uh there's a guy running
[57:45] behind this Bitcoin. then he catches
[57:48] some and then all of the sudden he
[57:50] catches all of them but his life is also
[57:53] over. So it kind of uh shows that we are
[57:58] trying to stack and stack and stack as
[58:00] much Bitcoin as we can but we forgetting
[58:03] that we actually also have to live our
[58:06] life. This this is different maybe for
[58:09] someone like me that is 26 years old
[58:11] now. Maybe now it's the time to stack a
[58:14] lot and work hard and and and make it it
[58:17] good. So there's like some balance to
[58:19] it. Um if if if you are 20, it looks
[58:23] different. If you are 80, it looks
[58:25] different to when you're 50. So there's
[58:28] definitely some uh some some balance and
[58:30] some variables depending on on how old
[58:32] you are. I think the youngest uh viewers
[58:35] are usually like 15, 14, 16 years old,
[58:38] something like that on YouTube. and the
[58:39] older ones I think uh 65 plus 70
[58:43] something like that. So there's a wide
[58:45] range of people that are listening now
[58:47] and if you're 80 uh you look at it very
[58:51] differently than when you're like just
[58:53] starting out with 18 years old and
[58:55] you're just like barely have some
[58:56] Bitcoin. Um so it's it's a good point of
[59:01] the bal finding that balance between uh
[59:04] working hard, stacking hard, but also
[59:07] enjoying life. You don't want to be in a
[59:10] situation where at the end of the life
[59:12] you have as a lot of Bitcoin but you
[59:16] didn't really live a life worth living
[59:19] for yourself. However you want to define
[59:22] that. But you also don't want to be in a
[59:24] situation where you spend all the
[59:26] bitcoin and then don't have any and have
[59:29] a lot of life left to live but you don't
[59:32] have any money. 100%. That's why I I
[59:35] like to again ask questions. Why am I
[59:37] stuck in Bitcoin? Like what is my goal
[59:39] here? Well, me at least my goal and
[59:43] people have different goals and it's
[59:44] perfectly fine. Everyone is different
[59:46] because I want to free myself to do what
[59:48] I want to do, right? So for me,
[59:50] definition of being rich is deciding
[59:52] what to do with my time. Like goes back
[59:54] to what we said earlier, right? If I if
[59:56] I had a lot of money, like millions of
[59:58] dollars a month, and I can't do what I
[60:00] want on a daily base, I'm not free. I
[60:02] I'm just I'm just as trapped as someone
[60:04] else. The difference is I have more
[60:06] money, but I'm still trapped. So for me,
[60:09] someone rich is someone who can do
[60:11] whatever they want with their time. So
[60:13] they wake up whenever they want. They do
[60:16] whatever they want. That's for me rich,
[60:18] right? And I think Bitcoin is going to
[60:20] allow you to get there if you wait long
[60:23] enough. Of course, if you're patient,
[60:25] there's going to be a reward at the
[60:26] tunnel. But equally, you cannot be
[60:29] possibly, and again, that's my my view,
[60:31] and everyone can disagree. That's fine.
[60:34] We're all different. But um stacking is
[60:37] not enough. Like buying Bitcoin
[60:39] obsessively is not enough. Like what's
[60:41] the end goal here? Of course, you you
[60:43] want to change something for something
[60:45] else. Maybe maybe it's time. Maybe it's
[60:47] a it's a gift you always wanted. Maybe
[60:50] you know how many times I see people
[60:51] saying, "Oh, maybe they bought a watch
[60:53] or a car or something. Oh, you stupid.
[60:56] In three years, Bitcoin is going to go
[60:58] higher and the car is going to cost you
[61:00] three times." Who cares? Like you have
[61:02] to use money. So those people instead of
[61:04] buying Bitcoin. It's the same concept,
[61:06] right? Like let's say I have $1,000
[61:08] salary a month, uh I can go out for
[61:10] dinner and and buy dinner which is going
[61:12] to cost me $100. Well, in 10 years if I
[61:15] would have bought Bitcoin, it's the same
[61:16] thing. Like you can't possibly have that
[61:19] kind of blinker on, right? I think it's
[61:21] more flexible. It's like make sure you
[61:24] are doing it responsibly. Like you said,
[61:26] make sure you track your goals, you
[61:28] track your lifestyle, and if it happens
[61:30] that you want to give you and your wife
[61:32] or husband a good vacation, man, go for
[61:34] it. We only live once. So, I think there
[61:37] is a balance there. Difference will be
[61:39] being responsible, but that's never good
[61:41] with anything. Not just Bitcoin. Like,
[61:43] if you are in responsible, if you eat 50
[61:46] bananas, well, that's not good. Even
[61:48] though bananas are nice, but don't eat
[61:50] 50 of them. Just have one, maybe two.
[61:52] Same with everything else. like yeah you
[61:54] can spend money you can give yourself a
[61:56] gift actually it's quite nice to reward
[61:58] yourself every now and then um I think
[62:00] it makes sense so as long as you have a
[62:03] plan you are on track I don't think
[62:05] there's any harm in in being nice and I
[62:07] think Bitcoin is going to empower you to
[62:09] be free but you have to treat this as a
[62:12] journey as opposed to oh I'm buying this
[62:14] thing and tomorrow that's this is where
[62:16] the alcoin trap comes in oh I'm going to
[62:17] buy this shitcoin and in 6 months it's
[62:20] going to thousandx and then what well
[62:22] first of all it's not going to happen
[62:24] because most likely you're going to lose
[62:25] all the money. It's like the casino,
[62:27] right? I think 98% of the people they go
[62:29] to the casino, they lose money. You
[62:31] know, I don't know the percentages, but
[62:33] um I I would guarantee that it's the
[62:37] same with altcoins. Like the majority of
[62:38] people they buy [ __ ] coins, they're
[62:40] going to lose money and then someone is
[62:42] going to make it and guess what they're
[62:44] going to do? They're going to double you
[62:45] on something else. That's how it works.
[62:48] If you if you double your money into
[62:50] Dogecoin, you're not going to be
[62:52] responsible with I mean maybe someone
[62:54] someone has done it, but the majority of
[62:57] the people aka the casino wins 98% of
[63:00] the time, right? Because whenever you
[63:01] double your money on the roulette, you
[63:03] don't stop playing. You gamble your
[63:06] winnings until you lose. Otherwise, the
[63:08] casino won't exist, right? I think
[63:11] that's the trap of the alcoin. And
[63:13] you'll be surprised like how many people
[63:15] still don't I mean stacking s is the
[63:18] easiest thing possible right you buy
[63:21] every month and you forget for two and a
[63:23] half cycles for 10 years that's your
[63:25] task no financial advice every week
[63:28] every month you buy satoshi's that's it
[63:31] you do it for 10 years it's such a
[63:34] simple instruction and yet no one is
[63:35] doing it because people want things now
[63:38] they want to they want to win today
[63:41] right not even tomorrow there's No
[63:43] tomorrow. I I I bought the coin now. So
[63:45] am I rich. That's why majority of the
[63:49] people are broke. And fun fact, if we
[63:51] could distribute to the entire
[63:53] population, same amount of money in 6
[63:57] months to a year, only a few would have
[63:59] the majority. Why? Because the majority
[64:02] of the people they're not responsible
[64:03] with money. Cuz that's not something
[64:05] people teaches us in school. Like we
[64:07] don't even we don't even know where
[64:08] money is until we study the books and we
[64:12] listen to the podcast and we stumble
[64:14] across Bitcoin. It's just a journey,
[64:17] right? So you have to be take charge of
[64:20] your finances. That's step number one.
[64:22] And then of course you will find Bitcoin
[64:23] because Bitcoin is the answer at least
[64:25] for me. But before the answer, you have
[64:27] to ask the questions like how do I
[64:30] retire myself? How do I free time to do
[64:32] what I love? Well, I have to be
[64:34] financially independent. Well, that's
[64:35] one way. There's probably more, but
[64:37] that's probably the biggest one. So then
[64:39] how do I become financially independent?
[64:41] Well, I go through a journey, right? I I
[64:44] stumble across a path and I stack as
[64:45] many SS as I can diligently for at least
[64:49] 10 years. I I haven't met anyone who is
[64:52] not happy. They stack SS for 10 years.
[64:54] It doesn't exist. So, so far there is a
[64:58] strong indication that if you stack sats
[65:00] weekly, daily, monthly for 10 years, in
[65:02] 10 years from now in
[65:04] 2035, I'm pretty sure you'll be happy
[65:07] you've done
[65:07] it. I love that message. And I think
[65:12] what you just said with we're giving
[65:13] everyone money, we've seen that with the
[65:15] stimulus checks. Most people spend it on
[65:17] on on dumb stuff. Some people spend it
[65:21] on Bitcoin. And I just posted that meme
[65:23] I think like a week ago on Twitter where
[65:26] you see how much money you would have
[65:28] now have if you put the whole stimulus
[65:30] check just in Bitcoin. It was what was
[65:33] it 30,000 44,000 like a really big
[65:37] amount what what the 1,400
[65:40] uh dollars came to be. So yeah and and
[65:43] in one point you also mentioned it was
[65:45] so good. The house is always winning and
[65:47] the same thing is happening with with
[65:49] alcoins. I see it all the time. Wh why
[65:52] why are the exchanges that are offering
[65:55] all the crypto [ __ ] coins so much bigger
[65:58] than those who only have Bitcoin? Not
[66:00] just because they have more coins, but
[66:03] also those like a Bitcoin only exchange.
[66:06] Most of the customers have a DCA
[66:08] running, maybe buying the dip every now
[66:10] and then, but they b buy maybe once a
[66:14] month, maybe twice a month, maybe every
[66:17] week, whatever they are setting for DCA.
[66:20] That's not that much um exchange fees
[66:23] that you can make there. But if you have
[66:26] a legent gambler that does it on a daily
[66:30] basis and he always pays 1% one and a
[66:32] half% as a as a fee, you make a lot of
[66:36] money as an exchange from that guy and
[66:39] you actually want to encourage people to
[66:42] keep uh changing coins and keep trading
[66:45] them. I don't know how it's in in
[66:48] Austria or in Dubai or in any other
[66:50] state but in Austria America wanted to
[66:53] say in Austria the biggest exchange
[66:57] Bitbunder actually uh paid off
[67:00] politicians to change the the law. So in
[67:04] Austria, we don't have taxes if you are
[67:08] staying within
[67:09] [Music]
[67:11] cryptocurrencies in order to keep people
[67:14] in the system and then you they can
[67:17] charge exchange fees. They also did the
[67:20] same thing uh to to with the taxes that
[67:24] you're now having to to to pay the taxes
[67:27] when you're the exiting. So you you
[67:29] actually and uh there was previously an
[67:32] um a t tax-free advantage in Austria.
[67:36] When you hold Bitcoin longer than a year
[67:38] or any crypto for that matter, you are
[67:40] having it tax free. They lobby it for
[67:44] removing that because they know if they
[67:46] removed people just trade more, they
[67:48] make more money. They exchange. So the
[67:51] the house is always winning and the
[67:53] people that are losing are those who
[67:55] actually buy [ __ ] coins.
[67:57] Yeah. I mean even [ __ ] coiner like the
[68:00] CEO and all the head of the projects
[68:02] they want your bitcoin right so and they
[68:05] have bitcoin and I think some of them
[68:07] they made their project to buy bitcoin
[68:09] so it's all an exit strategy for
[68:12] everybody so you have to just realize
[68:14] okay where am I on the chain on the food
[68:17] chain am I at the bottom on the top and
[68:20] again you know like we discussed earlier
[68:22] like ethereum was actually very
[68:24] appealing in the beginning in 2017 when
[68:25] it came out like I I bought some and $2,
[68:28] right? It was a good proposition. And
[68:31] then the old thing started off and now,
[68:34] you know, became like a crazy space
[68:36] where scams left and right. And it's
[68:39] really tricky. But again, you know, like
[68:41] I said, you have to go through your
[68:42] lessons. It's, um, sadly, some of the
[68:45] people, even some that I speak to, uh,
[68:48] they contact me every now and then,
[68:49] people maybe I haven't seen in 10 years,
[68:51] and they go, "Oh, yeah, I got into XRP."
[68:52] And I'm like, but you can you can't make
[68:56] them like they'll have to go through
[68:57] their own path. They'll have
[68:59] to and then it kind of it's kind of
[69:02] tribalized, right? You have all the XRP
[69:04] guys are hating on the Cardano guys are
[69:05] hating on the Ethereum guys and the
[69:07] Bitcoiner maxis and are all eating meat
[69:10] into a cave with no chairs. I'm like,
[69:12] guys, Jesus, can you be a little bit
[69:13] more flexible? You know, but I think we
[69:15] are in that tribe phase where there's
[69:18] people they hate ordinals, people they
[69:20] love ordinals. There's a lot of
[69:21] discussions on ETFs. ETFs are going
[69:23] against the ethos of Bitcoin itself, not
[69:24] your keys, not your coins. There's a lot
[69:26] of discussions even in within
[69:28] Bitcoiners, right? And I I find them
[69:31] fascinating because at the end of the
[69:32] day, what my view is I don't care like
[69:36] you do whatever you want with your
[69:37] money. Um, you buy Bitcoin like you
[69:39] said, you're a Bitcoiner. There's some
[69:41] like me and probably I have the maj the
[69:44] way majority of my portfolio in Bitcoin
[69:46] and it's not even in my hands. So, good
[69:48] luck in in hitting me with a hammer. I
[69:50] don't even know, right? because I build
[69:52] a system in which I don't want to put
[69:53] myself in danger. So, I mean, and then
[69:56] you have other people, they really good
[69:58] friends of mine in Dubai, they don't
[69:59] even have Bitcoin. They have ETF. That's
[70:01] it. All in ETF. Who am I to judge? Like,
[70:04] I don't care. I mean, how can I go to
[70:06] someone and say, "You you you should do
[70:08] something else." I mean, why why I can
[70:11] you just do you and let me do me, right?
[70:13] As long as I'm not hurting anybody.
[70:15] Different is when I'm scamming people.
[70:17] Okay. Well, that's that should be legal.
[70:19] Okay. But that's a different story. If I
[70:21] buy an ETF, how am I scamming you? I'm
[70:24] not scamming you. I'm buying an ETF
[70:26] which is a product in the market. But
[70:29] there is a lot of um a lot of solid
[70:31] position and tribalism and I think it's
[70:33] because it's a new market and it's going
[70:35] to be like this forever. I mean after
[70:36] all people fight over a football
[70:38] matchment. So not surprised they are
[70:41] fighting about who's more Maxi or
[70:44] whatever.
[70:45] It's such an interesting topic and then
[70:47] you have old people especially in Dubai
[70:49] there's a lot of crypto people and and
[70:52] uh token 2049 just finished. I didn't go
[70:55] but I I've I've been to some side events
[70:57] and you can see you can hear the
[70:59] discussions right oh I'm doing I've
[71:01] started my own coin I'm doing this thing
[71:03] and I'm I'm only in Pepe
[71:05] whatever okay well that you know as long
[71:08] as as long as you do you and you don't
[71:11] convince anyone anyone else to buy. Of
[71:13] course, if I do a video and I say, "Guy,
[71:15] let's buy my coin. Mr. Mcoin is going to
[71:17] the moon and I scam everyone, well then
[71:19] yeah, I deserve to go to jail 100%." But
[71:22] if I proactively go and buy a token I
[71:25] believe into, which could be whatever
[71:26] you name it, chain link or Cardano, why
[71:28] do I have to get [ __ ] from the people? I
[71:30] mean, it's my money, my choice, right?
[71:33] Uh, and and of course, I have my own
[71:35] ideas and my own actions, but I like to
[71:38] respect other people. Like I said, as
[71:40] long as we are not doing anything
[71:41] illegal and having said that, I do
[71:44] believe 100% and I'm ready to say it and
[71:47] prove it that whoever comes in into the
[71:49] crypto machine and they stick around,
[71:52] they'll be maxis in a couple of cycles,
[71:55] inevitable because you will learn your
[71:57] lessons. you might reduce your position
[71:59] like in the beginning my my position in
[72:01] alcoin was way bigger and then in 12
[72:04] years it basically shrunk to a point
[72:08] that probably this is going to be my
[72:09] last cycle in alcoins I don't know but
[72:12] the percentages in my portfolio diminish
[72:14] it right because you understand your
[72:16] lessons and maybe you have someone who
[72:18] comes in now in 2025 is much easier to
[72:21] be a maxi like I said you have a
[72:22] different access to information it's
[72:25] it's a different story you'll also learn
[72:27] your lesson with exchanges. I mean, I
[72:30] don't think it's going to be as bad as
[72:31] it was back in the days with MTO and all
[72:34] the other stuff, but you will have plays
[72:36] like there is MSTY, for example, now,
[72:37] which is MSTR. There is a lot of
[72:39] different plays, like you said in the
[72:41] beginning, to go back to your your
[72:42] topics. It's a different play. I I know
[72:45] a lot of friends, they are volume. They
[72:47] don't even have Bitcoin, which if you
[72:50] think about it, that's that's so far
[72:53] away from Bitcoin. like you are trusting
[72:56] a corporation to buy Bitcoin on your
[73:00] behalf. Okay, we can talk about it, but
[73:02] that's that's like an ETF, right? Uh
[73:05] it's like it's like I don't know which
[73:08] one is worse to be honest. Uh leaving
[73:10] money on exchange by micro strategy or
[73:13] uh by an ETF. I don't know. I guess it
[73:15] depends. It's up to you. Um also self
[73:17] custody is stressful. It's not for
[73:19] everybody. That's why bank have been
[73:20] invented. When when people are
[73:22] commenting, oh, it's only 12 words.
[73:25] Well, first of all, 18 or whatever
[73:26] depending on it's not just the words,
[73:28] it's everything else. It's everything
[73:30] else. How do you store them? How do you
[73:31] secure them? What happens if you if you
[73:34] get hit by a bus, right? So, there's so
[73:36] many variables. It's not just 20 words
[73:38] or 18 words. It's just way more
[73:40] complicated. Self- custody, it's like a
[73:42] it's a path. You can't expect that
[73:44] someone who has never heard of Bitcoin
[73:46] before goes full uh plate metal treasure
[73:51] gardening guys man it's a journey like
[73:54] of course if you've done a bunch of
[73:55] cycles you might be more familiar with
[73:58] terms and seed phrase and if you are a
[74:00] newbie who's never seen Bitcoin before
[74:02] you know how complicated everything is I
[74:05] mean stable coin there is like 12
[74:07] different stable coins alone on tether
[74:09] there is tether there is sana there is
[74:12] ethereum
[74:13] any any chain has stable coins on it.
[74:16] Avox it's so complicated like it's it's
[74:20] an interesting topic but um I would say
[74:22] go easy with people cuz everyone has
[74:24] their own journey right and whatever you
[74:26] experience for the past few cycle well
[74:29] that that helped you to get where you
[74:31] are but don't be judgmental for you will
[74:34] see some cats now in the background for
[74:36] someone who has a different story
[74:37] because we all go through different path
[74:39] right so just that that's why we say
[74:42] stay humble right and stack s because
[74:46] humble also mean don't judge people
[74:48] right if anything help them instead of
[74:51] commenting sometimes I'm getting some
[74:53] really heavy comments not even on me or
[74:55] on the channel but maybe of some
[74:57] something that someone said in the
[74:59] comments and they reply to that comment
[75:01] with a mean reply I'm like guys we're
[75:03] supposed to be helping each other right
[75:05] just just because someone has bought an
[75:07] ETF doesn't make that person an idiot
[75:10] right at least that's how I see it
[75:14] it's it's very true the human thing. Uh,
[75:17] and it's also like online so much easier
[75:19] because you are hidden behind an online
[75:23] figure and there's no chance you're
[75:26] going to hit him in the face. In real
[75:28] life, people are nicer to each other
[75:30] because it's a real possibility that
[75:32] someone actually hits you in the face if
[75:33] you say something stupid to them. Yeah,
[75:36] it's a good one. I I I I I I think
[75:38] actually if you bring someone that
[75:40] fights online in real life, they might
[75:43] actually like each other. They might
[75:45] actually enjoy a conversation to each
[75:47] other because they actually learn
[75:48] something from each other. But yeah, um
[75:50] I have one more thing that actually I
[75:54] wanted to start with that topic. Uh but
[75:56] uh we will end with that topic now. Um,
[75:59] Jeff Boo said it in my podcast never
[76:01] since it's it's it's kind of making
[76:04] circles in my my brain and I really
[76:06] don't know where 100% I will I'm
[76:08] standing on that. He said if Bitcoin
[76:11] fails as a medium of exchange, it will
[76:14] also fail as a store of value. Where do
[76:17] you where do you stand on that? If you
[76:19] agree and and why? 100%. I mean uh if
[76:22] you think about that's my opinion. If
[76:24] you think about why we think something
[76:27] is valuable, right, is because there's a
[76:29] bunch of different reasons. But if
[76:32] everyone would never sell their bitcoins
[76:35] and just hang to them for their life,
[76:37] well, that's there's no value in that,
[76:39] right? Because because why something is
[76:41] valuable in the first place? Well, it's
[76:43] probably a list of things. It's cars,
[76:44] blah blah, whatever. Scarcity doesn't
[76:47] make it can't be the only thing. Just
[76:49] because it's cars doesn't mean it's
[76:51] valuable because I can find a couple of
[76:53] things there are scars that nobody
[76:54] wants. So has to be a basket of things.
[76:58] And I think one of the one of the
[77:00] beautiful things about Bitcoin is like I
[77:02] can I can I can carry it with me. I can
[77:05] take it with me. I can divide it into
[77:07] things and and I can use it, right? And
[77:09] sometimes using it means not spending
[77:12] it. like I can if I take some Bitcoin
[77:14] and I store it and I'm not using it, I'm
[77:17] actually using it, right? So, it's a bit
[77:19] of a mind trick, but it makes sense. So,
[77:22] different people have different ideas of
[77:25] value, right? But to me, in that basket
[77:28] means I want to send you some of that
[77:32] thing and as part of the value, the
[77:34] proposition value. For example, I
[77:35] there's a friend of mine, Lena, she
[77:37] does, you know, the Michael Sildra
[77:38] t-shirts with a B. She's here in Dubai.
[77:40] to a friend of mine and I ordered a
[77:42] bunch of t-shirts. I I want to pay you
[77:44] in Bitcoin. Like that's that's the
[77:46] point. The point is has to circulate.
[77:48] Like I have to be able to that's my my
[77:51] opinion and I don't care if in 6 months
[77:53] I would have paid those t-shirts three
[77:55] times the amount cuz that's again you're
[77:57] thinking in fiat, right? So you have to
[77:59] make a distinction in between that's my
[78:02] my
[78:03] opinion being plugged into the Bitcoin
[78:05] standard and and like Jeff boot he like
[78:08] me lives in into it. I have no fiat
[78:10] under my name, next to nothing. So, I
[78:12] don't even think about fiat. Oh, but
[78:14] this big coin would cost me 50,000.
[78:16] Well, if I have to do a big movement,
[78:18] maybe, like I said earlier, I can be
[78:20] strategic and say, well, maybe instead
[78:22] of selling a big chunk to pay my rent, I
[78:25] can pay rent once a year. I can
[78:26] negotiate a better deal because I'm
[78:28] paying up front and then I can follow
[78:30] the Bitcoin cycles. Okay, maybe that's
[78:32] something I can do. But I want to be
[78:34] able to spend it on a daily base. I want
[78:35] to be able to use it. Otherwise, if I
[78:38] can't use it, how can be it a valuable
[78:42] thing? Right? And again, definition of
[78:44] use could be different for different
[78:46] people. Some people they want to store
[78:48] it and by storing it, there's a use.
[78:51] Now, in gold, you can do watches, you
[78:53] can do diamond, you can do
[78:55] jewelries. So, that's the use case of
[78:57] gold even though it's a small percentage
[78:59] compared to the amount of gold. And in
[79:01] Bitcoin, I think has to be circulation,
[79:04] right? I want to send you some whenever
[79:06] we go out and we split the bills or
[79:07] whatever I send my friends sats right
[79:10] and I think that's a valuable thing and
[79:12] if we don't if we don't use it in that
[79:14] sense I don't think it will be I don't
[79:17] think it will be as valuable as it is
[79:18] now. So I think the do not spend your
[79:20] bitcoin is fundamentally broken. I think
[79:23] you have to spend your bitcoin. Again,
[79:25] it's circumstantial, right? Like if if
[79:27] you have fiat and you want to spend
[79:29] fiat, okay, but then defeats the purpose
[79:31] of Bitcoin because we want to plug in a
[79:34] different network, right? So, it's so
[79:36] circumstantial. And again, you know, I
[79:38] can't go to someone who has never used a
[79:41] Bitcoin wallet and say, "You have to
[79:43] spend your Bitcoin." They're going to
[79:44] go, "Whoa, dude. I have my my Visa for
[79:46] that, my Mastercard. What do you mean? I
[79:48] use Bitcoin to save, right? It's my
[79:50] saving vehicle." Well, that yes, that
[79:53] true, but it depends on how much you're
[79:55] plugged in. If you are like Jeff Bezos
[79:57] and myself and probably you, we are
[79:59] plugged into Bitcoin. I mean, the
[80:01] business I have makes Bitcoin. Uh, my
[80:03] lifestyle uses Bitcoin. So, then I want
[80:06] to be able to spend it and I won't feel
[80:08] bad in buying like I can give you an
[80:11] example. When Bitcoin reached I think it
[80:13] was 100 102, I bought a motorcycle. It
[80:15] was my dream bike. I don't feel bad
[80:18] about it. Like of course I I don't have
[80:20] 29 B motorcycles. I have one, right? And
[80:23] I'm not going to think, oh, in 10 years
[80:25] going to cost it would have cost me a
[80:27] million dollar. I don't think in terms
[80:29] of money in that way. Money, sorry,
[80:31] money Bitcoin in terms of fiat, right? I
[80:34] think in terms of Bitcoin. So the
[80:36] mission stays the same. Stack as much
[80:38] Bitcoin as I can, but I have to leave in
[80:41] between now and that day. And I think
[80:43] your lifestyle should be a reflection of
[80:45] your wealth. So I agree with Jab. I
[80:48] think I think if you can't make that
[80:50] thing circulate in between the network
[80:53] then who wants it like would you want
[80:56] something you can't send you can't
[80:58] receive you can't use I wouldn't to be
[81:01] honest. So and it always typically
[81:04] that's how it begins right you find
[81:06] something valuable you go oh I found
[81:07] something very valuable but then you
[81:08] want to exchange it with something else.
[81:10] Hey can you give me some of those if I
[81:11] give you a little bit of this cuz this
[81:13] is very valuable. So then it becomes a
[81:16] currency right but it starts as a
[81:18] valuable thing that we all agreed
[81:19] collectively that has value but then you
[81:21] want to you want to make it circulate of
[81:23] everyone imagining from today from today
[81:26] specifically nobody would have ever move
[81:28] any bitcoin well then it would go to
[81:30] zero because who wants to buy it I mean
[81:33] he could they couldn't even buy it by
[81:35] the way because if we don't send it or
[81:37] sell it so I think has a balance in
[81:40] between and there might be a phase in
[81:42] which it becomes more I don't want to
[81:45] sell it now because it's going up maybe
[81:47] and there's be a phase in which maybe
[81:49] you are forced to like when I have to
[81:50] pay rent I'm like h I have to sell some
[81:52] bitcoin cuz I I need to pay rent so it
[81:55] it might be a swing in between the two
[81:58] but I don't think it can be one like it
[82:00] has to be something you need to be able
[82:02] to exchange right otherwise I don't know
[82:05] there's no point at least in my brain
[82:07] there there's a couple really good
[82:09] points in there I mean I I think people
[82:11] will sell it anyways Um, if you are 100%
[82:14] in Bitcoin and you uh are longer than 10
[82:20] years in there and you have that great
[82:22] life, you want to use that life energy.
[82:25] You you will not we're coming back to
[82:28] the original point of like dying rich
[82:32] living poor like why are you stacking if
[82:35] you never use it? So I think there will
[82:38] always be sellers in the market to
[82:41] compensate for the for the buyers. Um I
[82:44] I disagree with one one small thing. You
[82:46] said if if no one uh sells it, it will
[82:49] go to zero. Wouldn't it go to infinity?
[82:51] If if if no one sells it and and their
[82:54] only buyers, isn't that the supply shock
[82:57] moment? Well, but where are they buying
[82:59] it from if nobody sells it? So if
[83:02] doesn't circulate, so let's say from
[83:04] from tomorrow. That's what I meant from
[83:06] tomorrow or from today. We minor
[83:08] included we don't sell anything. So how
[83:12] can they buy it? Like they can't it will
[83:14] probably stay frozen at whatever 90
[83:16] something but it will be zero because
[83:19] there's no value in something you can't
[83:21] buy or you can sell. So there has to be
[83:24] and by the way when the price goes up or
[83:26] goes down because people are buying and
[83:27] or selling. It's not like it's a it's
[83:30] it's people. So we make the movement.
[83:32] So, uh, if we decided not to sell
[83:34] anything anymore, well, then how can it
[83:38] go up? Actually, it would go, it would
[83:40] stay what it is pegged to the dollar. It
[83:43] would probably going to flat, but it
[83:45] won't be something attractive because
[83:47] you can't sell it, right? So, it's
[83:51] locked. So, there has to be a healthy
[83:53] amount of people they want it and people
[83:55] they want to sell it. And like you said,
[83:57] super well said. By the way, imagine you
[83:59] invested in Bitcoin when it was $1 or or
[84:02] 50 or even $1,000 for it matters. And
[84:06] now it's like $100,000. And you're
[84:09] thinking, okay, so I've made my return
[84:13] at least I'm taking my prospect. Let's
[84:15] say you invested $10,000. You want to
[84:17] take that $10,000 back, right? In some
[84:20] sort of a maybe another asset. Ideally
[84:23] another asset not a liability another
[84:24] asset ideally then that's how you become
[84:27] rich you become rich when you have a lot
[84:29] of assets around you and this thing that
[84:31] Michael Sailor keep propagating like
[84:33] there's no second best which I
[84:35] completely disagree with him there is
[84:37] second third fourth fifth there is many
[84:39] other bests of course there are but then
[84:43] you have to be obsessed like in order to
[84:46] make to make it and by make it I mean
[84:48] free yourself so free you to do whatever
[84:51] you want to like get to the point where
[84:54] that's what rich to me means. Me mean
[84:57] means I wake up when I want to do what I
[85:00] want to do. That's for me that's a rich
[85:02] person. And if you if you can get there
[85:05] by selling some Bitcoin, please do that.
[85:08] Like please do some sell some Bitcoin to
[85:11] free yourself from the matrix. Yes, I
[85:14] think you should do that because it's
[85:16] going to allow you to become free,
[85:18] right? from your job you hate from the
[85:21] life you're trapped into it. So I think
[85:23] you should sell your Bitcoin and I think
[85:24] there is second and third best and I
[85:26] think diversification is not a bad idea
[85:28] if you reach a certain amount of
[85:30] financial freedom. Like I don't know
[85:32] anyone who has a lot of money and they
[85:35] have one thing that's it that doesn't
[85:37] exist. Like sailor has probably
[85:40] properties, yachts, cars. Like come on
[85:42] man.
[85:43] Like of course when you get to a certain
[85:46] degree of wealth you want to focus on
[85:49] things more. Yeah I get it. I I get it.
[85:51] I am all in bitcoin but I have a
[85:53] motorcycle I I have a computer I have
[85:56] you know I have things. So uh I think
[85:59] the message that he's saying is directed
[86:02] to certain people. they are uh trapped
[86:05] into a fiat life with and and the
[86:07] message works really well for them,
[86:09] right? Like if if you have a company
[86:11] with has with a lot of money like Apple
[86:13] or Microsoft, please follow what Sel is
[86:16] saying, right? Focus on one asset, you
[86:17] know, or if you are someone who wants to
[86:19] become financially independent. But if
[86:21] you are someone who was already there,
[86:23] well, the message is different. That's
[86:25] my opinion at least because if you are
[86:27] if you are never selling your Bitcoin
[86:29] and only having one asset and you have a
[86:31] and you are a
[86:32] billionaire I think you could do better
[86:35] right that's my opinion so again I think
[86:38] Bitcoin is helpful to get you to a point
[86:40] where you free yourself then when you're
[86:44] free which by the way just not just
[86:46] Bitcoin there's many other assets that
[86:48] can take you to freedom like there's a
[86:49] lot of people in Dubai they've done real
[86:50] estate for example or whatever it is
[86:53] that they can
[86:54] Of course, if you look into Bitcoin and
[86:56] the returns, and this is why Sailor is
[86:58] referring to, I think the returns in
[87:00] terms of capital, right? Uh yes, there's
[87:04] no second best in that sense, but I
[87:07] don't think diversification is on itself
[87:10] a bad thing. I had a good chat with
[87:11] British about MSTY, MSTR, and Bitcoin.
[87:16] And I think one of the problem that
[87:17] Bitcoiners have like hardcore Bitcoiner
[87:20] say Fina Moose by the way amazing guy we
[87:22] had dinner together and uh and many
[87:23] others like proper old school Bitcoiner
[87:26] they were saying well you know I don't
[87:28] have an income because Bitcoin doesn't
[87:30] give you an income. Bitcoin you have to
[87:32] sell it right so doesn't have any
[87:34] passive income yet. I mean you might be
[87:36] able to borrow against your Bitcoin
[87:38] but again shenanigans right you lose
[87:40] custody and all that kind of stuff. So
[87:42] as we speak today, as far as I know,
[87:45] there is no way for you to have passive
[87:47] income with Bitcoin. You have to sell
[87:48] some of it. So now there are some stuff
[87:50] you can do. A good example a British
[87:52] holler was saying is there is this guy
[87:55] who had $4 million in Bitcoin, right? A
[87:58] developer in Dubai and he was struggling
[88:01] because he he had to go to work and like
[88:04] 9 to5 have a job, but he has $4 million
[88:07] in Bitcoin, right? So, and you think,
[88:10] well, I am pretty sure if you manage
[88:12] your portfolio a little bit smarter, you
[88:16] can maybe quit your job, right? So, then
[88:18] how do you create a passive income?
[88:20] Well, there's probably a bunch of
[88:21] different ways, but you can do that with
[88:23] Bitcoin yet. So, you have to think about
[88:26] outside of the cage and say, okay, I
[88:28] have $4 million in Bitcoin. Great,
[88:30] amazing, well done. So, how now, how can
[88:33] I make myself free? How can I free
[88:35] myself from the rat race? Well, I have
[88:37] to take some of that Bitcoin and sell
[88:40] it. And eventually, you have to do it
[88:41] either way because think about someone
[88:43] like me. I have to sell. Like there is
[88:45] nothing I can do. Like even if I don't
[88:47] want to go to let's say I'm into the one
[88:51] channel like Bitcoin only. Well, guess
[88:53] what? I have to sell Bitcoin. Otherwise,
[88:55] how am I paying rent?
[88:57] So, I think the message there is I think
[89:00] you can challenge that at some point
[89:02] because like you said earlier, at some
[89:04] point that bag of Bitcoin you have is
[89:06] going to be quote big enough for your
[89:08] lifestyle. It's going to allow you to do
[89:10] something, right? Oh, now I can do
[89:13] whatever. I can buy a house in in the
[89:16] mountain. I can buy a better car. I can
[89:19] retire my entire bloodline. Whatever
[89:21] that might be.
[89:22] And that number is different from
[89:23] someone who lives in Dubai, in in
[89:25] Austria, in Australia, in in Africa. The
[89:28] number is always different depending on
[89:29] your lifestyle, your preferences. You
[89:31] can't say, "Oh, 10 bitcoin is going to
[89:34] retire you." That doesn't make sense
[89:35] because it depends of your lifestyle,
[89:38] right? There's people I know, they spend
[89:39] 10 bitcoins a month in Dubai. So, it
[89:42] depends about your lifestyle, right? So,
[89:44] what is it you want? What does
[89:46] retirement means? What what type of car
[89:48] do you want to drive? How many car you
[89:49] want to have? Do you want you want to
[89:50] fly private? Do you want 10 Rolex to
[89:53] change every day? So that's where do you
[89:56] live? How much is going to cost you to
[89:58] go out for dinner? Where do you want to
[89:59] go for dinner? If you go to Bourj
[90:01] Khalifa as opposed to into a street food
[90:04] in Thailand, it's a very different
[90:07] concept of retirement. So at some point
[90:09] you will be hit by that number. Then
[90:11] it's up to you to decide how you want to
[90:14] diversificate into fiat as opposed to
[90:17] other assets. And I think sailor I
[90:20] please him for the message but um like I
[90:23] said it's not for everybody right so at
[90:24] some point you'll have to probably plan
[90:28] your life I think and say okay now that
[90:30] I've reached my financial freedom how do
[90:34] I want to live uh what do I want from
[90:36] life do I want to work I don't want to
[90:38] work like you and me we can probably
[90:40] work 247 there's many people I know they
[90:43] would love to do nothing all day and hey
[90:45] I don't judge it's just not me but there
[90:47] is many people that
[90:49] kill to just go on the beach every day
[90:51] and just read books
[90:53] or you know turn on the sun or swim. So
[90:58] again, it's very personal. That's why I
[91:00] see Bitcoin as a channel to empower you
[91:04] to become who you want to be. But at the
[91:07] end of the day, we all want different
[91:08] things, right? That's very true. I like
[91:10] I like that message a lot. Um,
[91:12] unfortunately, we already at the kind of
[91:14] the end of the podcast. Um, I have a new
[91:17] end routine for people that have been on
[91:19] again, uh, like like yourself. Um, what
[91:22] have you learned since the last podcast
[91:25] outside of Bitcoin?
[91:28] Beautiful question. I've learned that
[91:30] you have to take care of your body. So,
[91:31] I've started this thing. There is a a
[91:33] Bitcoiner that lives near me. We have
[91:35] started this. It's like CrossFit. It's
[91:37] called F45. It's like um high interval
[91:40] frequency
[91:41] training which I think is super
[91:43] important. I know I'm stating the
[91:44] obvious here, but you have to take care
[91:45] of yourself because what's the point in
[91:47] becoming so rich? If you invest now in
[91:48] Bitcoin, in 10 years, you'll be so rich,
[91:50] right? you want to live longer to enjoy
[91:52] the wealth. So, I've learned you have to
[91:55] be aware of your body. And I've I've
[92:00] never done it. I've been always lazy
[92:01] with my my body, per se. I've been doing
[92:04] a lot of stuff that requires my my brain
[92:06] more than my my body. So, probably the
[92:09] main thing is discipline towards your
[92:12] your body. That's uh 100% important
[92:15] because we only have one as far as I
[92:16] know. And it's not getting any easier
[92:19] when you're getting older. you will feel
[92:20] it in your back, you know, your muscles.
[92:23] So, yeah, take care of the body cuz uh I
[92:26] think we've gone through a place where
[92:28] we kind of accepted everything, you
[92:30] know, body diversity, whatever you want
[92:31] to label it. I don't think it's cool. I
[92:33] think it's actually bad. I think it's
[92:34] unhealthy. And I think we should take
[92:37] care of our body. And I mean, I'm not
[92:38] saying we should go and publicly shame
[92:40] people, but we should encourage people
[92:42] to stay active because there's a lot of
[92:44] cell phone activities like we said
[92:46] earlier. sometimes just toss the phone
[92:48] in a corner and go for a run or find a
[92:50] buddy that has for example tomorrow I
[92:53] don't want to go but I I know that if
[92:54] I'm not going my friend is going to say
[92:56] hey dude I'm here what's wrong with you
[92:57] you said you wouldn't come so that helps
[93:00] right so create an environment in which
[93:03] is going to drive you to make some
[93:04] changes so maybe have find a friend
[93:07] who's very healthy and very fit and ask
[93:10] them say hey I can give you some
[93:11] knowledge on finance about bitcoin you
[93:14] can come and Monday Wednesday and Friday
[93:16] you drag me to the gym. So, that's
[93:18] probably something. Learn how to
[93:20] exchange valuable in your community to
[93:23] Yeah, maybe maybe you are maybe you are
[93:24] someone who's super fit but doesn't know
[93:26] anything about finance, right? Or maybe
[93:28] you are someone like me who's done a lot
[93:31] of finance but skinny. So, you can
[93:34] exchange value. So, that will be
[93:36] something since we did the podcast
[93:37] together, I've learned.
[93:40] So, you also look like 25 when you're 75
[93:42] years old. Well, that's the plan. I'll
[93:45] let you know. So, I mean, tomorrow I
[93:46] have to go again and I feel so sore. So,
[93:48] I don't know how I'm going to do it, but
[93:49] um I'll be there. I promise. Really,
[93:52] really cool. Now, we have it on
[93:54] video. We have an entertaining podcast
[93:57] where the previous guest is asking a
[93:58] question for the next guest uh without
[94:00] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[94:02] And the previous guest asked you the
[94:03] question, what is the most dangerous
[94:05] attack vector to Bitcoin? That's a good
[94:08] one. I mean, I would say that I would
[94:11] say the 51%, that would be the tricky
[94:14] one on a mathematical scale, which is
[94:16] also impossible. Um, I I'm not worried
[94:19] about quantum computers at all, cuz I
[94:21] don't think that's a problem. Uh, cuz
[94:23] think about everything else, man. I
[94:25] mean, if they can manage to crack the
[94:26] network, the most safe network on the
[94:28] planet, think about think about anything
[94:30] else, your social media, your bank
[94:31] account. Um, I think on on a
[94:34] mathematical level, I would say 51. So
[94:36] if someone can control double spending
[94:38] that will be a big problem but I think
[94:39] it's never going to happen anyway.
[94:42] So probably the second the second would
[94:46] be I know it's kind of controversial but
[94:49] the amount of coin owned by ETFs and or
[94:52] corporations and I put in the group also
[94:54] strategy right because like I said I
[94:56] love Michael Sailor but um he's not
[94:59] going to be around forever and he has a
[95:01] company which is traded publicly which
[95:03] means someone can take over and sell
[95:05] everything which technically they
[95:06] shouldn't because there's going to be so
[95:08] big and so powerful that it's because of
[95:10] the choices they made which will
[95:12] Not really interesting. But I would say
[95:14] the second larger will be who's
[95:17] accumulating the most of the Bitcoin as
[95:19] we speak. I don't know if you're
[95:20] following, but there's been I think it
[95:22] was two weeks ago we had two days 1
[95:25] billion each day into ETFs. So am I
[95:29] worried? No. But um it's growing fast.
[95:33] So
[95:35] uh some people are referring to paper
[95:36] Bitcoin, right? So I don't know what's
[95:38] going to happen. Um, I'm keen to find
[95:41] out because the price is going to be
[95:42] much higher, right, if demand continue
[95:44] to sore like this, but it could be a
[95:47] very different scenario in a few years
[95:48] from now. So, and Black Rockck is not
[95:50] angel, by the way. I mean, if you think
[95:52] Black Rockck is a nice company, do some
[95:54] research. They've done some terrible
[95:56] things. So, yeah, uh, keep your Bitcoin
[95:59] in self custody because I think they
[96:01] will find ways. And by the way, I'm
[96:03] predicting there's going to be a ton of
[96:05] companies popping up like mushrooms
[96:06] saying, "We're going to allow you to
[96:08] borrow against your Bitcoin. Deposit
[96:10] your Bitcoin over there cuz everyone
[96:12] wants your Bitcoin." That that that's
[96:14] the layer where we are now. Everyone
[96:15] wants them. So, you'll have to be super
[96:18] trained to protect your bitcoins and
[96:20] learn how to selfcast them because
[96:22] that's um I think it's coming. It's it's
[96:25] going to come. So I would say second
[96:27] largest discounting the 51% of double
[96:30] spending will be ETFs
[96:33] accumulating a lot of bitcoins. Yeah.
[96:37] Could be scary. Interesting.
[96:38] Interesting. And ETFs are I I I get why
[96:43] people buy them, but I it's it's like
[96:46] most people could just would be better
[96:48] off with if self custody or
[96:53] with That's a difficult topic. I I think
[96:55] like self custody will will evolve a
[96:57] lot. I think we will have such an easy
[96:59] way of self-custody with uh I told that
[97:03] a lot on on the podcast. What if Apple
[97:06] encounters self custody in Bitcoin? What
[97:09] if they make an self-custody wallet on
[97:12] your phone that unlocks if you bring
[97:14] your iPad and your Apple Watch close by
[97:17] and then all of the sudden you can make
[97:18] transaction then all of the sudden you
[97:20] have a pretty nice easy self custody
[97:23] setup. It's not perfect. There are
[97:27] attack vectors for that self custody
[97:29] setup but it's a lot better than an ETF.
[97:31] But yeah, it it's just uh self-c is an
[97:34] interesting topic how it will evolve
[97:36] over time and how it will how it will
[97:38] grow. Yeah, that's a good point. And by
[97:40] the way, I'm not against it. Yes, by the
[97:41] way, I think the network should go where
[97:44] he's going to go. Right. I I I don't
[97:46] think we should control the direction of
[97:48] the network. I think we should just let
[97:49] people use it. So I don't think we
[97:50] should say no, Black Rockck should not
[97:52] be allowed. No, it's a it's a it's an
[97:54] open and free decentralized network.
[97:55] Anyone should be able to do whatever
[97:57] they want. That's again otherwise we we
[97:59] would go against the ethos of Bitcoin.
[98:01] But at the same time, we should, you
[98:03] know, be mindful and and at least
[98:05] recognize who's playing the game now
[98:07] because it's change. And when it comes
[98:09] to Apple, um, it's a good point and
[98:11] Google and all that kind of stuff. My
[98:12] two Satoshi's will
[98:14] be this the number of steps in between
[98:17] you and your Bitcoin are going to
[98:18] determine the amount of safety. It's
[98:20] like when you eat fruit, right? So if
[98:23] you eat a a fruit from a tree, it's like
[98:25] you and the fruit. If you put something
[98:27] in between sugar process is going to
[98:30] become less healthy than before. So the
[98:33] less amount of steps you have between
[98:34] you and self custody the healthier will
[98:37] be your self custody. So I love that you
[98:39] know just be mindful how many steps
[98:41] there are in between that that that's
[98:42] that's it. Absolutely. And and in terms
[98:45] of Black Rockck I love the saying the
[98:48] worst thing about Bitcoin is that it's
[98:50] open and permissionless so your enemies
[98:52] can also buy it. like even if you
[98:55] disagree with someone, even if you
[98:57] really dislike what they're doing, they
[98:59] can still get get some Bitcoin. Thank
[99:01] you so much, Mauricio, for for for being
[99:04] on Mr. M podcast. Really, really cool.
[99:07] Um, before I let you go, where can
[99:08] people find you and and ask you
[99:10] questions and reach out to you? First of
[99:12] all, thank you for having me. Always a
[99:13] pleasure. I love being uh in your
[99:15] podcast and talking to you is always a
[99:16] great thing. Uh, I have also a YouTube
[99:18] channel, Mr. M Podcast. It's the same
[99:20] handle everywhere. So I also started
[99:22] recently in Rambo cuz I think it's a
[99:25] good alternative to YouTube. No no no
[99:27] hate but the more we can propagate the
[99:30] message the better. There is also the
[99:32] show goes on everywhere. So iTunes and
[99:35] you know everywhere just at Mr. Podcast
[99:37] all over the place. Really cool. Thank
[99:40] you so much for taking the time on this.
[99:42] And also thank you so much for everyone
[99:44] that is watching and listening for
[99:46] joining us today. As always I'll be back
[99:48] tomorrow with another episode. Bye-bye.
