[00:00] you learn about the blockchain trilemma
[00:01] and it's really just that simple the
[00:02] others aren't decentralized they're
[00:04] really not as secure and it's just very
[00:06] first principles Basics like are they
[00:08] even solving the first problem statement
[00:11] it's just a test net for Bitcoin Bitcoin
[00:13] is the soundest strongest hardest Bas
[00:16] layer we can have and I align much
[00:18] closer with the values in Bitcoin of
[00:21] inclusion empathy truth honesty low time
[00:24] preference whereas you have in all the
[00:26] cryptos all the scammy premine oh change
[00:30] the codee oh we'll just pretend like a
[00:32] act didn't
[00:34] happen why is it so important especially
[00:37] for the younger crowd to get into
[00:39] Bitcoin and get educated on that Bitcoin
[00:43] world that is coming uh really soon I
[00:47] think yeah no it's a great question and
[00:51] I think this like the one sentence
[00:53] answer that I've heard recently um all
[00:56] credit goes to Safe in amose but he said
[00:58] you know I can't say it better than he
[01:00] did basically Bitcoin is a tool for
[01:02] younger generations to earn their wealth
[01:04] once so what I mean by that ear you know
[01:07] what his words meant was that often you
[01:11] go to school you graduate um you get a
[01:13] job and you work to earn your wealth and
[01:16] then you need to work again to ensure
[01:20] your wealth maintains its value so
[01:21] you're kind of earning your wealth twice
[01:24] wants to get it the first time and then
[01:25] wants to preserve it but Bitcoin allows
[01:29] us younger generations to earn their
[01:31] wealth once and so I think if nothing
[01:34] else you know Bitcoin is a tool to
[01:36] preserve your Financial Freedom um and
[01:40] you know have be able to live the life
[01:42] financially that you want to live and
[01:44] this is where part two comes in um where
[01:48] you know you don't need to spend after
[01:49] you get home from work thinking about
[01:51] your Investment Portfolio like go live
[01:53] your life pursue the job you want to do
[01:55] how you want to contribute to society um
[01:58] and so to quote another bitcoiner
[02:00] can who said that bitcoin's not the
[02:02] signal but it's the greatest noise
[02:04] remover so remove the noise from your
[02:06] life the tasks that detract from what
[02:09] you actually want to do um and go find
[02:12] the noise for yourself and so I think
[02:14] that's just kind of the most concise
[02:17] reason why younger Generations need to
[02:20] know about Bitcoin yeah I think it's
[02:22] fascinating because uh I started out in
[02:26] investing in the stock market and then I
[02:28] came to know about bitco later and I did
[02:32] quite well and a lot of people
[02:34] especially my family and friends ask me
[02:36] oh how can I do it how can I do it and
[02:37] always try to tell them what I do but I
[02:40] actually did the investing work like I
[02:42] actually did like uh researching about
[02:44] the stocks researching about the
[02:45] management team and stuff like that and
[02:47] it's so great that with Bitcoin we have
[02:48] a technology where everybody can save
[02:51] their financial
[02:53] energy without being a portfolio manager
[02:56] a stock picker and professional investor
[02:59] like that's uh such an a great thing to
[03:02] have and maybe for like the younger
[03:05] generation that just now comes up in
[03:08] this whole Bitcoin world and they are
[03:09] able to do that with Bitcoin they are
[03:12] starting now with like 18 years old and
[03:14] they doing that what will like change in
[03:17] their life or on a level which you want
[03:20] to you want to choose uh to comparison
[03:24] to like people that are born in 1971 for
[03:27] example or 197 1980 uh what will change
[03:30] for the people that are now born into
[03:32] this Bitcoin
[03:34] world so your question is what will
[03:36] change for them like if a bit ideally a
[03:39] world under the Bitcoin what's the like
[03:42] what's the comparison like people are
[03:44] that are living in a feed world without
[03:47] the Bitcoin I mean I guess they have
[03:49] gold a little bit uh they always had
[03:51] gold but it's different than Bitcoin and
[03:54] what what's the difference to people are
[03:56] now getting into Bitcoin with uh like
[03:59] starting the life in
[04:02] Bitcoin so honestly I don't really think
[04:04] I have an answer for you yet but what I
[04:07] am studying at school um is really the
[04:10] Bitcoin Network um so I have kind of a
[04:14] fascination with the numbers in Bitcoin
[04:16] and I think it's not a coincidence that
[04:19] the word network is mentioned 21 times
[04:22] in the white paper um to just kind of
[04:24] emphasize I'm abstracting this to
[04:26] emphasize the importance of the Bitcoin
[04:28] Network and not just lowercase be
[04:30] Bitcoin as the asset and so what I have
[04:34] um proposed and now gotten approved to
[04:37] study at my college is the Bitcoin
[04:40] Network so stepping back for a second um
[04:43] money is kind of the base layer of
[04:45] society and right now our money is
[04:47] broken and now we have a solution to
[04:50] this problem outside of the current
[04:52] system through Bitcoin so what I'm going
[04:55] to hopefully look into is well lading up
[04:59] if money is the base layer lading up and
[05:01] we have right now the Fiat Network and
[05:04] all of our social structures are
[05:05] influenced by that from food to
[05:07] education to kind of you name it what
[05:10] does our world look like if Bitcoin kind
[05:13] of is the new sound Bas layer how does
[05:16] that lad up and look at the social
[05:17] structures so honestly I don't know yet
[05:21] what does our world look like under a
[05:23] Bitcoin standard for you know people in
[05:27] the future but I think can look at okay
[05:31] you know we know Bitcoin emphasizes low
[05:33] time preference thinking about the
[05:35] future cooperation optimism saving um
[05:40] and so then maybe you just like you look
[05:41] at the values that Bitcoin embodies and
[05:43] allows for that our current systems do
[05:46] not trve for um and that will have
[05:49] impacts uh this morning I was actually
[05:51] doing a reading for a class and it this
[05:54] is for the seminar class of the um new
[05:56] program I'm in at school and it was
[05:59] about kind of the importance of being
[06:01] stupid in scientific research and how to
[06:05] be productively stupid was the point um
[06:08] and it means you know you should study
[06:10] something that you don't know the answer
[06:12] to that you feel like you're just kind
[06:14] of waiting around an uncertainty but
[06:17] unfortunately I think where we are right
[06:19] now in the world where our money does
[06:21] not hold its value where the dollar has
[06:23] lost 98% of its purchasing power since
[06:26] 1971 to bring that in where you kind of
[06:29] have have to be more short-term um focus
[06:32] more High Time preference uh it's really
[06:34] not incentivized to be productively
[06:38] stupid or wait around in uncertainty um
[06:41] so I think you know possibly a huge
[06:44] benefit that will come under a world
[06:46] with a more Bitcoin focus-based standard
[06:49] is the ability to think long-term about
[06:51] hard problems um and really you know
[06:54] commit to meaningful Endeavors so I hope
[06:57] that answers your question but I think
[06:59] we're getting you know not only a new
[07:00] money but kind of a new value system
[07:03] that also will um spread throughout our
[07:06] spread throughout our
[07:07] society yeah I always try to make the
[07:10] comparison with Street running versus
[07:12] sand running if you run on a street okay
[07:16] yeah like if you are running on a street
[07:19] like a solid
[07:21] street it's okay because like you have a
[07:23] solid Street you can run fast on that
[07:25] street it's like a Bitcoin Foundation uh
[07:29] it's it's like hard money you can rely
[07:30] on it's predictable and it's just money
[07:33] at the end of the day it's like it
[07:34] doesn't come magical to you you still
[07:36] have to do something for it like if
[07:38] you're just oh I'm on a Bitcoin standard
[07:41] now I can lay on the couch that that
[07:42] does not solve any problem but if you do
[07:45] something productive being like a a dog
[07:48] tourist that saves lives you can save in
[07:50] in Bitcoin and you have that solid
[07:52] Street under you but in a feeld standard
[07:54] you're more like on the sand like you
[07:56] have to run so much faster to get ahead
[07:58] you have to
[07:59] you have to constantly be in the sand
[08:02] and it's it's really hard for you to
[08:04] keep up and it feels everything is
[08:06] harder and in the end of the day Bitcoin
[08:08] is just money but it changes so much
[08:12] because it gives us that whole
[08:14] Foundation of uh being able to save for
[08:18] for the future and that's why it's
[08:20] always so interesting to to to interview
[08:23] especially young like I'm myself I'm
[08:25] just 25 like I'm myself I'm usually
[08:29] youngest person on my
[08:31] podcast how old are you actually I'm 20
[08:35] I'm okay 20
[08:37] that's already five years differ it
[08:41] feels a lot I'm feeling old now uh how
[08:44] do you pe in in school uh see Bitcoin
[08:48] like in school I think you always have
[08:50] an interesting VI because you're forced
[08:52] with people into a class like you cannot
[08:54] choose your friends the further way you
[08:57] go in life I think you can more and more
[08:58] choose with who you you be and how do
[09:02] your pce look at Bitcoin and uh did you
[09:06] do you have successful orange pilling
[09:08] stories or effective ways to Orange Peel
[09:11] orange pill 20 years old yeah um I have
[09:15] to say I think the most effective
[09:17] strategies are to be really clear on the
[09:19] definitions and to use analogies um so I
[09:22] can touch more on that but I'm always
[09:25] super pleasantly surprised whenever I
[09:28] talk about Bitcoin with my peers and
[09:30] friends and it's very often um and I
[09:34] think it matters what environment you're
[09:36] in so for instance yesterday was
[09:39] clubfest which is basically when all of
[09:41] the clubs on campus uh have a table in
[09:45] the big like track house and you can go
[09:48] look at clubs and so we had a great
[09:51] turnout there I think I have about 75
[09:53] signups um for the Cornell Bitcoin club
[09:55] which I started this semester um which
[09:58] is very very exciting and I printed like
[10:01] 210 quarter cards they're called like
[10:03] little flyers and I think I have I don't
[10:05] know 10 20 left so I'm hoping for a very
[10:08] good turnout very good um and so yeah
[10:11] that's super exciting um and then last
[10:14] night so I do this thing where I have
[10:16] like Sunday dinner for my friends and we
[10:19] talked about Bitcoin for like an hour
[10:21] and a lot of people uh like it was just
[10:25] I think it was a huge success like I
[10:26] think most people my age are very open
[10:29] and curious um it's just a matter of not
[10:33] knowing what questions to ask or just
[10:35] never having been exposed to these
[10:37] topics because you know this isn't
[10:40] talked about in school and that's why
[10:43] you know I think the importance of
[10:44] Bitcoin clubs and so you know that might
[10:46] be the biggest barrier it's not that
[10:49] people like our age gen Z isn't
[10:51] interested in Bitcoin it's just maybe
[10:53] they just never have been kind of primed
[10:55] or know that topic exists and then I
[10:58] think where it's a little different is
[11:00] when you uh are in kind of like a
[11:02] blockchain focused environment um and
[11:05] with that I hope that more people will
[11:09] start to see Bitcoin as not just money
[11:11] um because I think often Bitcoin is
[11:13] spoken about just as money and maybe not
[11:16] something that they can participate in
[11:18] whether that be like you know the
[11:19] technology like actually building you
[11:22] know on bitcoin with lightning or you
[11:24] know whatever it is or also a job I mean
[11:27] eventually I think every business will
[11:29] become a Bitcoin business so it's a
[11:31] process but I am very hopeful about you
[11:34] know all the people that I interact with
[11:36] at school and talk about Bitcoin with um
[11:39] and then all around the world um I had
[11:42] the opportunity to go to the Africa
[11:44] Bitcoin conference in Ghana and there
[11:46] were a ton of students there and so I
[11:49] think you also have to look outside of
[11:50] your immediate circle and there's just
[11:52] you know Bitcoin students all around the
[11:54] world that are doing stuff and
[11:57] organizing it I had someone from Korea
[11:59] messaged me the other day and they have
[12:01] like a whole Bitcoin blog in Korean and
[12:03] their University um so I have you know
[12:07] nothing to say but positive on you know
[12:09] my hope and optimism for my generation
[12:11] it's just they need to know and they
[12:13] need to know in an unbiased way like
[12:16] whenever I talk about Bitcoin with
[12:17] people my intent is never for them to
[12:20] leave the conversation and go buy
[12:23] Bitcoin I mean obviously I would hope
[12:25] that they would for their future selves
[12:28] but I think the most important thing is
[12:30] that you know they now know they're
[12:32] curious they can look into it for
[12:34] themselves you know Bitcoin restores
[12:36] your agency I just want people to have
[12:38] the information and them to make
[12:40] decisions for themselves to protect
[12:42] their themselves um and to you answer
[12:45] your question on the strategies so
[12:47] recently what I've found is it's really
[12:49] helpful to clarify the difference
[12:51] between like lowercase be Bitcoin
[12:54] uppercase be Bitcoin how is Bitcoin not
[12:57] crypto how is Bitcoin not blockchain
[13:00] what is currency what is money um and
[13:03] then analogies like I my favorite what
[13:07] is like blockchain analogy is that the
[13:09] New York Times is the longest running
[13:11] blockchain just something just make all
[13:14] these Concepts much more tangible or the
[13:17] visual of about you know to your point
[13:20] about sand and steel like if a
[13:22] blockchain doesn't optimize for security
[13:24] and decentralization then you're
[13:26] building whatever structure that is out
[13:28] of sand you know it'll look nice but it
[13:30] won't last you need to build out of um
[13:34] steel like security and decentralization
[13:35] so anyways anywhere you can put in an
[13:37] analogy I think is super helpful um
[13:41] another one that I uh I'm very grateful
[13:44] for all the knowledge I get through
[13:45] bitcoiners and I feel bad that I kind of
[13:47] steal all their great phrases but
[13:50] another one that I have been enjoying
[13:52] recently from sapine is and this is when
[13:56] I'm talking about my major with the
[13:58] professors
[13:59] most of them hear Bitcoin and just the
[14:02] currency and I kind of say look like I'm
[14:04] not studying Fiat coin or like the
[14:07] dollar I'm studying Bitcoin like the
[14:10] Bitcoin Network like the Fiat Network
[14:12] like the whole thing um so just anything
[14:15] like that I think is really helpful
[14:17] interesting uh you said an very
[14:19] interesting thing every business is
[14:22] every business will be a Bitcoin
[14:24] business uh what do you mean by
[14:27] that so this speaks of the network piece
[14:30] and other people have said this before
[14:32] as well but um I just think Bitcoin
[14:35] aligns to whatever your unique incentive
[14:38] is so I think the energy companies will
[14:40] come into the space um it will just make
[14:43] sense like we're seeing with micro
[14:44] strategy to hold Bitcoin on the balance
[14:47] sheet um I think the what Bitcoin did
[14:49] that came out recently where they just
[14:51] talked about how I'm going to have the
[14:53] numbers wrong but basically micro
[14:54] strategy should have whatever it is 800
[14:57] million and it's like eight billion
[14:59] those numbers might be wrong um but it's
[15:01] just going to make sense um and Bitcoin
[15:04] addresses so many problems so many
[15:06] different pain points um we're just
[15:08] we're just in the building stage yeah
[15:11] micr strategy became like an an early
[15:14] Bitcoin kind
[15:16] of it's like in way for people to invest
[15:19] in Bitcoin and actually I had this
[15:21] conversation a lot with with with people
[15:23] because I first were in the stock world
[15:25] and then in Bitcoin a lot of people like
[15:27] oh I just buy my strategy I don't want
[15:29] to deal with self custody I'm like come
[15:32] on learn about Bitcoin learn about self
[15:34] custody but a lot of people actually
[15:36] especially from the stock world yeah I
[15:37] buy micro strategy then I have exposure
[15:39] to bitcoin and I have a business that
[15:42] actually produce a cash flow and yeah
[15:44] kind of they were right uh they got more
[15:47] exposure like if you measure it in fear
[15:49] terms uh but yeah they did not get the
[15:52] whole Freedom side of things I guess um
[15:55] and the freedom side is critical like
[15:57] the first time I heard about Bitcoin was
[16:00] just from kind of number go up and it
[16:03] was in a I hate to keep saying the word
[16:05] blockchain but it was in a blockchain
[16:06] class and that Bitcoin was presented as
[16:10] oh it's the first one um but it wasn't
[16:13] until I had the opportunity to go to the
[16:14] oso Freedom forum and I learned about
[16:17] Freedom go up and that is just a
[16:19] critical piece that I think uh really
[16:22] helps kind of just explain what Bitcoin
[16:26] is um and it's just a really critical
[16:29] part of the education process yeah it's
[16:31] like come for the money and stay for the
[16:33] Revolution and it's kind of like come
[16:36] come come because the number goes up and
[16:38] stay because your freedom goes up and
[16:41] it's a lot of people over overlooked
[16:43] that
[16:44] and you can always tell especially when
[16:47] you have like in Twitter and you
[16:48] interact with a lot of people and you
[16:50] can quickly tell if somebody is just in
[16:53] it for like number go up technology and
[16:55] they are like early in the education
[16:58] process or someone is like I don't even
[17:01] care what the price is today I or like
[17:04] the people that are actually liking
[17:05] Bitcoin they like Bitcoin going down
[17:07] because they're getting cheaper in and
[17:09] they getting morees they they understand
[17:12] that concept and it's interesting and
[17:15] like a lot a lot of younger people I
[17:17] feel like fell fall in this blockchain
[17:21] and crypto trap and it's like oh this is
[17:25] interesting they have like a fancy
[17:26] website and they found this speaks and
[17:29] like they're getting really sucked into
[17:32] uh I think easier uh in this whole uh
[17:36] crypto blockchain web free kind of thing
[17:40] um how did you like first of all how did
[17:43] you did not uh get sucked into and
[17:47] resisted that uh that say seduction of
[17:50] quick Buck uh and uh how do you see it
[17:54] like with with younger folks this is
[17:55] just my subjective feeling or is it
[17:57] actually like you have to fight against
[18:00] that blockchain web free
[18:02] thing yeah so I think there's a couple
[18:05] different thoughts um but also I'll just
[18:07] add oftentimes these blockchains come
[18:10] and it's like oh we're going to put on a
[18:12] hackathon and you can Win $5,000 or
[18:15] we'll aird drop you tokens or you can
[18:17] we'll you know assign you to tokens so
[18:20] that you can vote in governance
[18:21] proposals and uh yeah we'll come and
[18:24] speak we'll send you merch um you know
[18:27] Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing
[18:28] department we don't do any of that and
[18:30] so you know we don't have that Outreach
[18:32] to students um also it's just like you
[18:35] go on whatever coinbase and you see oh I
[18:38] can buy this for 10 cents great like
[18:41] it's just it it seems more accessible
[18:43] whereas you see oh you know $44,000
[18:45] Bitcoin and people don't know that
[18:48] there's the concept of Satoshi that
[18:50] there's a 100 million Satoshi in one
[18:52] Bitcoin um so why did I not kind of fall
[18:56] down that path well I should say when I
[18:59] so I learned about this whole world um
[19:02] when I was a senior in high school and I
[19:05] was in this program at my school called
[19:07] the Technology Innovation and
[19:09] Entrepreneurship program um certificate
[19:12] program and you had to take different
[19:14] classes depending on which one of those
[19:17] strands you were in and so I was an
[19:19] innovation and a class titled blockchain
[19:22] was one of the offerings and so I at the
[19:26] same time was starting my first kind of
[19:29] real job um I was working at IBM on
[19:32] their stem for girls program and then
[19:34] later I also worked on their educational
[19:37] platform and um then you know my parents
[19:40] were like okay Ella we want to talk to
[19:42] you about investing and saving your
[19:44] money and trying to you know set your
[19:47] set yourself up um for success in your
[19:50] future we really want you to be
[19:51] independent and just be financially
[19:54] secure um and so I was like yes okay and
[19:57] so
[19:58] I bought ethereum cardano Bitcoin I
[20:02] think I actually didn't initially own
[20:05] majority Bitcoin I really didn't know
[20:08] what any of this was and as I mentioned
[20:11] I was just hearing the narrative yeah
[20:14] Bitcoin was the first and now there's
[20:16] others and they do more and un
[20:18] sustainable development goals and Etc um
[20:23] and you know I had no context also like
[20:25] the 40 Years of research that went into
[20:28] the Bitcoin white paper prior to I just
[20:30] had no context um so I did I owned
[20:34] cryptos and then I as I mentioned I went
[20:38] to the oo Freedom Forum they I think
[20:40] that might have been the first year they
[20:41] had kind of like a Bitcoin track like a
[20:44] Financial Freedom track um and there
[20:48] were a couple of different inputs here
[20:49] so that was one I was also I am just
[20:53] really interested in numbers I wouldn't
[20:55] say I'm excellent at math um but I find
[20:58] numbers very interesting and I had
[21:00] started taking note of uh and I love
[21:03] history as well so executive order
[21:07] 6102 and then the every 2016 blocks kind
[21:12] of the reversal palindrome for the
[21:14] difficulty adjustment and how there's uh
[21:17] two one and six zeros in 21 million and
[21:21] so I just started seeing all of this and
[21:24] that's where speaking about my Twitter
[21:26] that's where 21 million for the 2st came
[21:29] from um and then like Martin Luther and
[21:32] the Protestant Reformation having the
[21:34] same day he tacked the 95 thesis the
[21:36] same day the Bitcoin white paper was
[21:38] published and just this all turned into
[21:40] an article um but I was seeing all this
[21:43] I was like wow there's just substance
[21:45] here um I also decided to read the US
[21:49] federal budget um and just like where's
[21:52] the money going and you know I think to
[21:56] understand Bitcoin like you don't just
[21:57] read the white paper you learn economics
[22:01] and about cryptography and energy and
[22:04] philosophy just all the components and
[22:06] so I started just having my whole world
[22:09] kind of opened up to areas I never even
[22:11] really knew existed um and from there
[22:14] you fall down the proverbial rabbit hole
[22:17] and you just realize like Bitcoin is it
[22:21] and so then it's kind of Bitcoin only so
[22:24] I had a very I guess short crypto
[22:28] phase um but quickly and then you learn
[22:30] about the blockchain trilemma and it's
[22:32] like well it's really just that simple
[22:34] the others aren't decentralized they're
[22:36] really not as secure and it's just very
[22:39] first principles Basics like are they
[22:41] even solving the first problem statement
[22:44] I mean maybe some cool things will come
[22:48] out of it but I mean I heard someone say
[22:50] this recently like it's just a test net
[22:52] for Bitcoin like Bitcoin is the soundest
[22:56] strongest hardest base layer we can have
[22:58] and I align much closer with the values
[23:02] in Bitcoin of inclusion empathy truth
[23:06] honesty low time preference whereas you
[23:08] have in all the cryptos all the scammy
[23:12] for lack of better word the pre-mine oh
[23:15] we'll change the code oh we'll just
[23:17] pretend like a act didn't happen all of
[23:19] that just it didn't align with me and so
[23:23] I guess there's sorry that was a little
[23:25] scattered but there were a lot of
[23:26] different inputs coming at the same time
[23:28] time um that ultimate is like bitcoin's
[23:31] it I'm super excited to announce that
[23:33] this podcast got the first ever sponsor
[23:37] 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one
[23:41] and they teach and preach self custody
[23:44] this is my goto exchange when someone
[23:47] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[23:49] from this is the easiest entry for
[23:52] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[23:55] Plus at the same time support this
[23:57] podcast use code Robin and click the
[24:00] link in the description I have a
[24:02] completely different question now uh
[24:05] because I just thought about it you are
[24:08] 20 years old uh and you are extremely
[24:12] good in speaking I usually have I
[24:16] usually have way older uh people on and
[24:19] extremely experienced people also with
[24:22] like from every range some some made the
[24:25] first podcast with me some have like 100
[24:27] podc because tomorrow I have Jeff Bo on
[24:29] like from every kind of range of of
[24:32] speaking level and knowledge level I
[24:33] have people on but uh I just thought
[24:36] about it and I was listening to was like
[24:38] wow you're speaking extremely good
[24:41] you're really early in Bitcoin also like
[24:44] my question would be like how the
[24:48] heck how the heck did you uh get to all
[24:51] this knowledge and also the speaking
[24:53] skill uh that you are right now just as
[24:56] a Sidetrack uh
[24:58] question yeah uh maybe the speaking
[25:01] skills I am a very strong believer you
[25:03] have to do things that scare you or that
[25:05] are a little uncertain and so I was very
[25:09] fortunate that I went to an all girl
[25:11] school for most of my life and just in
[25:13] that environment the teachers really
[25:16] emphasized you know speak up ask your
[25:18] question you know you have a voice it
[25:20] matters and so I think that had a huge
[25:22] kind of consequence later on my ability
[25:25] to speak now um cuz just was always told
[25:28] and my parents also said you know Ella
[25:30] like we value what you have to say
[25:32] please share your opinion um and then I
[25:36] mentioned the role I had at IBM and I
[25:40] had just the most wonderful bosses there
[25:43] and they also really pushed me to like
[25:46] if we had a meeting with maybe people uh
[25:49] in higher positions they would really
[25:52] you know push me to take ownership of
[25:55] some of that call and present the work
[25:57] and so I think I just my whole life I
[25:59] mean all the credit just goes to them
[26:01] for kind of in honestly like kind of
[26:03] small stake scenarios pushed me to you
[26:07] know just practice um and over time that
[26:10] compounds so I think that has been um
[26:14] very helpful on my ability to speak and
[26:17] communicate um and sorry what was your
[26:20] other question how did I learn all of
[26:21] this uh yeah I mean you kind of answered
[26:24] it already and you said like over time
[26:27] it compound and you're very right but
[26:29] usually it's not with 20 already I'm
[26:32] just really impressed yeah yeah um but
[26:35] how I mean how I learned all the Bitcoin
[26:37] stuff uh Natalie Brunell was one of the
[26:40] first podcasts I found um a lot of
[26:43] podcasts a lot of books um I mean I
[26:46] think all the normal sources and then
[26:49] maybe like a year or so I don't I'm
[26:51] forgetting the timeline but then I found
[26:52] Twitter and I never had social media
[26:54] before Bitcoin but it's kind of it's the
[26:57] best place to get news and so now I'm on
[27:00] it yeah today is a a great place like
[27:03] exess you now call it um you are also
[27:08] and I heard your podcast with Natalie
[27:10] prunell and you also uh talked about Ai
[27:14] and language modeling and how it's
[27:18] possibly a like a threat to society we
[27:21] have to have like the the ethics coded
[27:24] into it like how did you get started
[27:27] with that whole rabbit hole and how can
[27:30] you code in ethics in
[27:33] AI yes so to your second question I
[27:36] think the answer might be no and let me
[27:39] backtrack so I uh did my junior year of
[27:43] high school in Beijing um I did not I
[27:46] landed didn't know a word of Mandarin um
[27:49] but I had an incredible house family
[27:51] incredible teachers um yeah that was
[27:54] huge on speaking like one month in maybe
[27:57] maybe two months in we had to stand up
[27:59] in front of like our host families in
[28:00] the entire class and give a like a five
[28:03] minute speech in Chinese and I had only
[28:06] been learning for I don't know a month
[28:09] two months and so you know do things
[28:11] that scare you um but so one of um
[28:16] really most incredible teacher and she
[28:19] wrote a character up on the board and
[28:21] I'm happy to go into it but basically
[28:23] she showed us how much uh or how ethics
[28:26] can kind of be coded inside of spoken
[28:29] written languages um and at the same
[28:32] time I think I was taking an online
[28:35] course on AI and I just um found it
[28:38] interesting I had heard about the idea
[28:40] of the singularity and basically all uh
[28:44] computer power Minds um superseding that
[28:47] of humans by about
[28:49] 2040 and I just thought huh you know if
[28:52] you can code ethics um into a spoken
[28:56] language or written language language
[28:58] can you do that in a computer language
[29:01] or computer code um because we have all
[29:04] of these AIS but there's really no seat
[29:07] Bel on them of how they should act
[29:09] morally and also depending on your
[29:12] culture it's different um so for
[29:15] instance uh there's a very I think
[29:17] pretty famous study on uh you have a car
[29:21] and there there's either a baby or an
[29:23] older woman um that's in the crosswalk
[29:26] in the car is going to hit one of them
[29:30] and depending on which culture you're in
[29:32] you decide which one to save and so if
[29:34] you're in um if you're Chinese you're
[29:36] more likely to save the older women
[29:38] because their culture just really values
[29:40] the elderly if you're in France you're
[29:43] more likely to save the child the baby
[29:45] because their culture puts greater
[29:47] emphasis on younger
[29:49] children um and so yeah you can't have
[29:53] one ethical AI they're different um and
[29:57] then so I still had this I found Bitcoin
[30:00] and I kind of realized that maybe you
[30:03] know if you have two problems that I
[30:05] both and passionate about both but I
[30:07] just felt Bitcoin is the work I can't
[30:09] not do like I just I fa to draw that
[30:11] Bitcoin is the problem we have to solve
[30:13] first if we if we don't have sound money
[30:16] not to be kind of extreme or pessimistic
[30:18] but nothing else matters like we have to
[30:20] solve the foundation of society um and
[30:24] so then I took a Class A year ago now um
[30:27] it's called the psychology of language
[30:30] and in it uh actually was a fascinating
[30:32] book I would actually read the book If
[30:34] it wasn't a textbook um it's called The
[30:36] Language game and the game is basically
[30:41] when you have a conversation like you
[30:43] and I um you kind of can enter into this
[30:46] concept of the um Now or Never
[30:49] bottleneck so you have meaning that you
[30:52] want to get across to me I have meaning
[30:54] that I want to share with you or and
[30:56] with the audience
[30:57] um but if you just look at a like a
[30:59] water bottle the bottleneck is really
[31:01] narrow and so it's hard for us to get
[31:04] all the meaning that we want through
[31:06] that bottleneck and so this is the game
[31:08] that we have to win and so there's
[31:10] different strategies to do that um so
[31:13] like in our conversation if you're
[31:15] speaking and I nod or I say um H or I
[31:19] kind of there's inflection to emphasize
[31:21] a question those are all tools we can
[31:24] use to try and win the game and get our
[31:26] message through the bottleneck or if
[31:29] we've spoken before and we could bring
[31:31] in the idea of the communication Iceberg
[31:33] you know maybe we've had a past
[31:34] conversation or maybe we're from the
[31:37] same town you know there's different
[31:39] tools you can utilize and so at the very
[31:41] end of the book um there is a kind of a
[31:46] as an aside um a note on AI and can you
[31:50] code ethics into computer language and
[31:53] if I remember right the conclusion was
[31:55] essentially no or or not quite um but
[31:59] then this summer I was listening to um
[32:02] duu bansel and others um talk at Bitcoin
[32:06] Miami and I think it's called like Ai
[32:08] and dreams um if you put like Bitcoin
[32:11] Miami AI dreams it'll probably pop up um
[32:14] but this is really where he gets a lot
[32:16] of credit for some of the ideas um I
[32:19] might get this slightly wrong but he
[32:21] proposes that Bitcoin the currency is
[32:24] kind of like the metabolic uh Curren or
[32:27] energy of artificial intelligences so
[32:31] plural um and because humans own all of
[32:34] the Bitcoin and AI needs kind of money
[32:38] or like a metabolic budget to operate
[32:41] than if an AI works in the favor or the
[32:45] the moral standard of humans and they
[32:47] are rewarded they get money uh the
[32:49] Bitcoin if not then they don't and so
[32:52] kind of training it in that sense um all
[32:55] to say now I kind of wonder super
[32:57] abstractly if uh Bitcoin can kind of do
[33:00] what language can't and because it has
[33:03] these values that I mentioned earlier of
[33:07] cooperation uh low time preference um
[33:10] don't trust verify all of that if and
[33:14] Bitcoin is for everyone all eight
[33:15] billion people can participate in the
[33:17] Bitcoin Network um if it's kind of a way
[33:20] to say like oh you know I see you what
[33:22] you're doing matters to me what you say
[33:24] matters to me um we're all s
[33:27] incentivized uh to support each other if
[33:30] it can almost do what language can't
[33:33] like our I can't speak every language on
[33:36] Earth um a lot even within English a lot
[33:39] gets lost um in conversation so kind of
[33:43] a super abstract can Bitcoin do What
[33:46] language can um and I wrote a medium on
[33:49] this really really cool and uh the
[33:52] question I think everyone that is in Ai
[33:55] and Bitcoin at the same same time will
[33:58] AI choose
[34:00] Bitcoin as a the as the main thing well
[34:05] I think by my understanding of what I've
[34:08] kind of learned so far um also Michael
[34:10] denworth has really interesting uh
[34:12] thoughts on this it's the AI doesn't
[34:15] choose it's like the AI the companies or
[34:19] like uh I don't think it's AI That's
[34:22] choosing this that's kind of the point
[34:24] that hum there's a collaboration between
[34:26] humans an AI but I I could be wrong but
[34:29] that's my current
[34:31] understanding that's uh that's that's
[34:34] really really cool um how's your
[34:37] personal like Bitcoin standard
[34:41] progressing uh I always see like
[34:45] bitcoiners are getting more and more
[34:47] deep in the rabbit hole and the more and
[34:50] more deep in their Rabbit Hole they're
[34:51] like first the Bitcoin just on Exchange
[34:54] a little bit then they're like self
[34:56] custody then and they are getting in in
[34:58] coin joints and they are like trying to
[35:00] not even have a single Dollar pay
[35:02] everything with Bitcoin like on on the
[35:05] whole whole Spectrum on on that uh how's
[35:09] your personal like coming to bitcoin
[35:13] standard uh
[35:15] going yeah well I think I if it's all
[35:17] right I'm not going to share much on my
[35:20] uh custody situation um or privacy
[35:25] strategies yeah um
[35:27] so but I think you know maybe I'll talk
[35:30] more Bitcoin standard on my life um just
[35:34] how you kind of approach your everyday
[35:36] actions and how you live your life um I
[35:40] think Bitcoin just makes you really
[35:42] conscious of you brought up Jeff Booth
[35:44] earlier your time and your energy and
[35:46] where you're putting it and so that's
[35:49] one of the you know huge things I'm
[35:51] grateful for with now being able to
[35:53] officially study Bitcoin in university
[35:55] is like I know Bitcoin is just for me
[35:58] the most important thing I can be doing
[36:01] um the most important you know topic
[36:04] area that I can be learning about um
[36:07] where I can be putting my energy and so
[36:10] now to bitcoin us to just have to be my
[36:12] hobby and I would sit in classes and I
[36:15] was studing cognitive science before and
[36:17] you know I'd write notes about Bitcoin
[36:18] and the margins um but now I just I get
[36:21] the freedom to just think about Bitcoin
[36:24] uh kind of without restraint and so
[36:26] that's really nice that I you know I'm
[36:28] in I want to be conscious of my time and
[36:30] energy and now to be supported in doing
[36:33] that um has been very nice uh and then
[36:37] yeah I guess in October I so I've wanted
[36:40] to run a marathon for a very long time
[36:43] since I was in
[36:44] China and basically I just kept failing
[36:48] at doing that on my goal I would just
[36:51] kind of not follow through I'd fall off
[36:52] track I during Co I just uh I was in
[36:57] three high schools at one time anyways I
[36:59] just it wasn't really prioritized um but
[37:02] then the whole concept of proof of work
[37:05] is just uh has had a huge impact in my
[37:08] life and actually doing the work and so
[37:13] um the relation to the marathon is that
[37:15] I think uh uh people say okay I'm going
[37:18] to do uh when you're mining Bitcoin the
[37:22] actual work is you're securing the
[37:24] network and then the Bitcoin you
[37:25] received is the reward
[37:27] and so through proof of work uh when
[37:29] you're when I was training running for
[37:31] the marathon it was like no I'm securing
[37:33] myself my mental stamina my grit my
[37:37] perseverance and then the reward is if I
[37:39] get to run the marathon if I actually
[37:41] finish it like running the marathon
[37:43] isn't the goal it's it's not the purpose
[37:46] of why I'm doing it it's uh the purpose
[37:49] is securing kind of my own self just
[37:52] like the purpose of Bitcoin mining is
[37:54] securing the network and the reward is
[37:55] Bitcoin so sorry I didn't say that super
[37:57] clearly but um just the concept of proof
[38:00] of work I also I think has been very
[38:02] impactful on my own life yeah I think
[38:06] proof of work is such an uh important
[38:10] concept to embody because it shows that
[38:13] uh you have to do like so many people I
[38:18] think want to take the shortcut want to
[38:20] take like uh like when they let's take
[38:24] content creation as an easier example
[38:27] they're like oh let's figure out how CH
[38:29] gbt can write all my tweets like
[38:32] nobody's nobody's interested in that AI
[38:36] uh written stuff like you can write
[38:39] stuff with AI they can help you in the
[38:41] research they can help you uh make your
[38:43] text better but just just making the
[38:47] shortcut oh like let's let's uh
[38:49] Outsource everything and not do any hard
[38:52] work people know if you put in the hard
[38:55] work or not like this is something
[38:58] people are not
[38:59] stupid yeah and so to your your question
[39:01] earlier about you know strategies with
[39:03] orange pilling and I said analogies are
[39:05] good so this is another one um sometimes
[39:08] I tell my friends when I'm kind of
[39:10] describing this I'm like look you're not
[39:12] going to graduate from college if I go
[39:14] and tell the dean or the president that
[39:17] I you know saw you studying or if I tell
[39:20] your you're not going to pass your exam
[39:22] if I go tell your professor that I I saw
[39:24] you looking at your notes no you have to
[39:26] go sit in the library wherever do
[39:30] practice problems study the material do
[39:32] the work like this is just how life
[39:34] works is exerting energy over
[39:38] something that's a that's amazing how is
[39:40] your um you're doing a lot like you're
[39:43] doing podcast you're doing uh school
[39:46] you're doing work with uh generation
[39:49] Bitcoin yeah how is uh your like daily
[39:55] uh um progress going like what are you
[39:58] doing in a day what are you focusing on
[40:01] and what's what's next for you yes um
[40:05] Google Calendar is my friend uh and kind
[40:08] of a Google Sheets to track everything
[40:11] um I if I if I don't have that I I don't
[40:14] think I could really function
[40:16] effectively um but I don't know if
[40:18] you're asking like what is my day-to-day
[40:20] look like um was that yeah I wake up
[40:23] pretty early um I'm definitely more of a
[40:26] early bird uh than most people my age um
[40:31] so I wake up early go to the gym do some
[40:33] work um I structured my class schedule
[40:36] this semester so that I have uh one
[40:39] class on Monday in the morning and then
[40:41] my Tuesday Wednesday Thursday are pretty
[40:43] full with all classes and then no class
[40:45] Friday so that I can um like today it's
[40:48] a Monday I've had a lot of kind of
[40:50] Bitcoin related meetings um that's how
[40:53] Fridays look too so I try and um kind of
[40:57] structure things in a way that that you
[40:59] should kind have good flow going through
[41:00] different tasks um right now we're
[41:04] regeneration Bitcoin is going to be
[41:06] launching the Bitcoin students network
[41:08] uh in March and so we're doing a lot of
[41:10] work for that um and so yeah I think you
[41:15] know I wake up early I go to the gym
[41:17] read um I also try to read at night um
[41:21] yeah reading and setting time to think
[41:23] are really critical uh for me um um
[41:27] normally consume like some podcasts
[41:29] throughout the day um someone's recently
[41:31] recommended to me that I should look at
[41:32] audio books so that probably will be
[41:34] something that uh I incorporate in the
[41:37] future um I also try to you know seeing
[41:40] friends is important I mentioned like I
[41:43] have Sunday dinners that I have a group
[41:44] of friends over you know kind of lunch
[41:47] throughout the week um and then classes
[41:50] and homework and my days are pretty
[41:52] packed um but I you know like I said
[41:54] earlier I wouldn't rather to any other
[41:56] way and I feel like every ounce of how I
[41:59] use my time it's packed but I I feel
[42:02] like I feel good about it I'm doing
[42:04] something with purpose and you know
[42:07] that's another thing people My
[42:08] Generation I think I heard this quote if
[42:11] you have life you have purpose uh go
[42:14] find it and for me I'm really grateful
[42:17] that I have found a sense of uh purpose
[42:21] or um meaning through Bitcoin and I get
[42:23] to pursue that and spend my time and so
[42:26] I feel I use my time well um and that's
[42:29] my wish for other people my age you know
[42:32] do what you actually you like you you
[42:34] lose time in doing something go do that
[42:37] like you shouldn't have to do things
[42:38] that you don't enjoy uh doing just for
[42:42] the sake of you know preserving your
[42:43] wealth or earning money through it um so
[42:46] obviously work hard that's not what I'm
[42:47] saying um but you should be able to work
[42:50] hard at something you
[42:52] enjoy yes and also I think especially
[42:55] for young people it's it's such an hack
[42:57] to uh learn as much as you can and build
[43:02] something like in your like I think I'm
[43:05] now in the mid 2030 range like from 20
[43:08] to 30 like 25 is exactly the middle and
[43:11] I benefit so much because I never put
[43:14] earning on top of my priority list I
[43:17] always put learning in top of my
[43:18] priority list uh with my Fe job with
[43:21] everything I always try to go there
[43:25] where I learn the most and not where to
[43:27] earn the most and the funny thing is uh
[43:31] the earning part came from itself
[43:34] because you get so much better in what
[43:36] you're doing and people will recognize
[43:38] your talent and will recognize what
[43:40] you're doing uh and appreciate that and
[43:43] will compensate you well if you do good
[43:45] work like it's it's it's just
[43:47] a really simple law I think yeah and
[43:51] another um a TED Talk that I really like
[43:55] uh I think your name is
[43:56] J I might have this wrong and I might
[43:58] get the title wrong but it's um I think
[44:00] y 30 is not the new 20 uh if I get that
[44:03] right but a lot of people kind of ignore
[44:05] their 20s or they think it's a
[44:07] transition decade or something that
[44:10] maybe doesn't need a lot of priority um
[44:13] but it does and it's really critical
[44:16] that um you know people our age take
[44:18] advantage of this time period um and so
[44:22] and I think for the large part everyone
[44:24] I interact with they're all doers like
[44:27] they want to work hard and contribute um
[44:31] so yeah I just I I hope more people
[44:33] realize that too that no now is the time
[44:35] to really do work and uh her advice at
[44:39] the end is uh don't worry about like
[44:42] having an identity crisis you don't need
[44:44] to like life is long you might have many
[44:46] different careers you don't need to
[44:49] worry about you know this is the one
[44:50] thing I'm going to be good at instead I
[44:52] think she phrases it as go get some
[44:54] identity Capital like to your point go
[44:56] learn go do something anything you can
[44:58] change um kind of the idea of like a
[45:00] multi- potential I think comes up um and
[45:03] use your network like just start talking
[45:05] to people I think it's again about low
[45:07] stake opportunities um yeah just just
[45:10] try go meet people yeah the 20 to 30
[45:13] range is like testing your limits how
[45:16] much can you work testing your uh
[45:19] relationships how um how is how is
[45:22] everything going and it's there was this
[45:24] quote I don't remember from who is it
[45:26] like from 20 to 30 test out how much can
[45:30] you actually do how much work can you do
[45:32] and I feel sometimes a little bit like
[45:34] that because uh for example today I
[45:36] usually try to sleep like around eight
[45:38] hours and have like nice time between uh
[45:42] everything but today I woke up like at
[45:44] 5: did the workout I also try to wake up
[45:47] early uh but because I want to also
[45:50] record podcast with all around the world
[45:52] people I had some last time someone on
[45:55] at 2 2:30 in the morning and my time
[45:57] because it was like he was in Australia
[46:00] and now today I also I woke up at 5:
[46:03] went to work at my fear job uh that I
[46:07] still have uh and came home at like 5
[46:10] then I at seven had my first podcast
[46:12] today now it's like 11:20 oh
[46:19] sorry I obviously I want to have the
[46:23] podcast like and and I have I have
[46:26] another podcast uh it's in it's it's
[46:30] like if you go through the limits uh you
[46:34] actually find yourself like you know
[46:36] where your limit is and you get to know
[46:39] yourself so much better and this is yeah
[46:41] this just the the point that I want to
[46:43] make that it's when when you're young
[46:45] test everything out also how much can
[46:48] you work and also uh what what do you
[46:50] want to do and it's like trying and and
[46:53] learning is really good yeah and just
[46:56] also like I think that people need to
[46:58] choose Bitcoin for themselves or you
[47:00] know I I never want to force my interest
[47:02] or my belief on someone else because
[47:05] like that's not Bitcoin the point is
[47:06] that people choose for themselves learn
[47:08] fors you know of course I want to be a
[47:10] resource be supportive um but also like
[47:13] a lot of my friends waking up early does
[47:15] not work for them and that's okay like
[47:17] maybe you know they need to work later
[47:19] so I just think it's important to say
[47:20] that you know there's not a one strategy
[47:23] that works for everyone just pay
[47:25] attention to what works for you that's
[47:28] right trying out stuff is so
[47:30] important um we are coming really fast
[47:33] in the we're progressing really fast in
[47:34] the podcast and uh uh we are having an
[47:38] end routine where the previous guest
[47:40] asks a question for for the next guest
[47:43] and uh your question is uh for the next
[47:47] four year cycle like the coming yeah
[47:51] yeah Bitcoin mining cycle uh do you
[47:54] think people are coming in for the bad
[47:57] or the good
[48:00] intentions
[48:02] um like if they're own Bitcoin for
[48:04] better good intentions yes if they are
[48:06] coming into like the people that are
[48:08] coming now in the next four years into
[48:11] Bitcoin uh if they're coming in for good
[48:14] or bad bad intentions it's an
[48:16] interesting question yeah it's
[48:18] interesting because I ALS I
[48:21] think yeah I want to answer it kind of
[48:24] carefully but I I think everyone comes
[48:26] in like you come in for you have a
[48:29] problem statement and you come in to
[48:31] solve that for yourself um and I think
[48:34] it's also interesting just the fact of
[48:36] how Satoshi aligned the you know the
[48:40] Cycles to kind of align with like the US
[48:43] political cycle as well and I think
[48:45] there's just a lot of events that will
[48:46] probably transpire over the next years
[48:49] that will bring different people in um I
[48:52] don't know why this is I guess a hard
[48:54] question to answer but I
[48:56] I think like it I I don't hate to say it
[48:58] doesn't matter but I just kind of go
[49:00] back to the Bitcoin is for everyone like
[49:02] I I hope people come in for good I hope
[49:05] people will come in that they know like
[49:07] okay Bitcoin is a tool that I can
[49:08] preserve my wealth in like like my
[49:10] Twitter handle 21 million for the 21st
[49:13] century like I'm coming in because
[49:14] Bitcoin is solving a problem that I have
[49:17] um so I I hope you know the large
[49:19] majority will be doing that um of course
[49:23] I mean we've seen the charts like the
[49:25] kind of it use cases of Bitcoin versus
[49:27] the dollar it's like minuscule compared
[49:29] to the dollar so I think anyways it
[49:32] appears most people come in for good um
[49:34] I guess I'm not yeah did they have an
[49:37] answer to that
[49:38] question or they just prosed it to the
[49:40] next oh we have like this this uh end
[49:44] routine is like the previous guest asked
[49:47] just a question for the next guest for
[49:50] the next one yeah and and that's uh it's
[49:53] interesting like and you have today and
[49:56] an really interesting task because my
[49:58] next guest as I said before is Jeff poof
[50:02] so you basally can can uh choose then a
[50:06] question for for Jeff poof I usually
[50:09] actually I usually do it off podcast uh
[50:13] when I'm off the podcast and then you
[50:15] try to think of an in question and I
[50:17] usually give with give time but I just
[50:20] had this in my mind that I can actually
[50:22] do it also on the podcast if you have
[50:25] now question but if you uh sure well I
[50:28] think you know I think I Jeff Boo has
[50:31] been really kind of instrumental in my
[50:33] Bitcoin experience just how he
[50:35] approaches the topic and uh yeah I think
[50:39] just how he approaches the topic in life
[50:41] and interacting with other people that
[50:42] aren't into Bitcoin um and you know also
[50:46] with ego death and all the many things
[50:48] he's doing and uh now with core just all
[50:51] the different areas he's involved in I
[50:54] suppose I'd ask you you know
[50:57] how what does he what would he say to
[51:00] students coming into Bitcoin like how
[51:02] should or also how um should I guess let
[51:06] me phrase this better um if he had
[51:09] advice to give to students on how they
[51:10] can participate or what he wants people
[51:13] in the Bitcoin space to do to support
[51:15] students um or how does he think this
[51:18] next Generation can um get involved and
[51:21] participate with Bitcoin might be
[51:22] interesting to hear his take on that so
[51:24] how can then Next
[51:26] Generation uh participate in Bitcoin
[51:29] best uh to uh achieve
[51:32] something yeah something something along
[51:34] those lines but I think maybe I will do
[51:38] it always uh while recording the podcast
[51:43] okay but let's let's see how I will
[51:46] progress with that um yeah thank you for
[51:49] being on the podcast uh for the end uh
[51:52] where can people get in touch with you I
[51:54] guess on Twitter is the best place and
[51:56] then do you want to uh say anything for
[51:59] for the latest for the last minutes yes
[52:03] um so Twitter is the best um my handle
[52:05] is just 21 mm for the 21st and then on
[52:09] my uh page there's a link tree where you
[52:12] know pretty much you can find all of my
[52:14] links there um I guess I would also just
[52:17] kind of shout out generation Bitcoin and
[52:19] the Bitcoin students Network um
[52:20] generation Bitcoin is a nonprofit
[52:22] focused on providing younger generation
[52:25] with um Bitcoin education and career
[52:27] opportunities and then coming in March
[52:30] will be the Bitcoin students Network um
[52:32] which is for a little bit uh older age
[52:35] range so more University age students um
[52:38] helping grow and scale Bitcoin clubs and
[52:40] really just being a kind of One-Stop
[52:43] shop resource um to join the students
[52:47] Network um and find educational
[52:49] materials and so I would uh also highly
[52:52] encourage um people to go check out both
[52:54] of those pages is um and it's it's all
[52:56] on the link tree as well oh thank you
[52:59] thank you for being on Ella yes thank
