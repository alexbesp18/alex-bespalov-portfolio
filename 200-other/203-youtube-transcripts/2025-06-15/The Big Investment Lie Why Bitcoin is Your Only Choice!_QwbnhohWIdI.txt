[00:00] Bitcoin is the ultimate savings unit
[00:03] this is literally the memory card of
[00:05] your life I can put this hot energy into
[00:08] the hardest asset known to man Bitcoin
[00:10] and that is now stored energy when you
[00:13] save you are delaying gratification
[00:15] delay of gratification is the ultimate
[00:18] superpower humans can finally save for
[00:21] the first time ever in history and what
[00:24] do you say oh yeah I'll buy it later
[00:26] yeah that's the dumbest thing I've ever
[00:27] heard of this is making us think that
[00:30] our savings and our investing should
[00:32] work the exact same way because humans
[00:34] are no longer happy with having to wait
[00:37] 15 years for something we can't even
[00:39] wait 15 minutes for food you're not an
[00:41] investor you're a police officer you're
[00:42] a cashier you're a podcaster you're an
[00:44] influencer you're supposed to be doing
[00:46] those things you're supposed to be
[00:47] creating value in this world and saving
[00:50] it in a memory card so you don't have to
[00:51] wake up in the morning and start this
[00:53] all over again what happens when a CEO
[00:55] says something stupid your stock value
[00:57] drops what happens when the earnings
[00:59] comes out the earnings doesn't even have
[01:00] to be bad the stock drops do you think
[01:02] that your savings your time and energy
[01:04] should be in something like that they
[01:06] don't know what they want in life
[01:07] because no one is teaching them about
[01:10] [Music]
[01:14] money it's it's also a new topic that
[01:16] I've never discussed I think before you
[01:19] are let I'm not native speaker
[01:22] Behavioral Analyst it's it's one of the
[01:24] words that's difficult to pronounce from
[01:28] Austrian sorry about that
[01:31] no no no no worries but what what is
[01:33] that what are you doing yeah so like you
[01:35] said you pronounce it great don't worry
[01:38] behavior analyst so what I am is
[01:41] somebody who really understands human
[01:44] behavior all right so I specifically
[01:47] work with children with autism so I work
[01:50] with these little kids who are engaging
[01:52] in high maladaptive behaviors a bunch of
[01:54] behaviors that are not good for their
[01:56] lives right now okay so they're doing
[01:58] self injuries they are destroying
[02:01] property aggressing all of these kind of
[02:03] things they can't function in a normal
[02:05] society right so what I do is I Target
[02:08] the behaviors that are essential for
[02:10] their lives and help teach them those
[02:13] things right now so they can strive
[02:14] right so maybe that they want to go to
[02:15] school right now or their parents want
[02:18] them to just be in a daycare or just you
[02:20] know just regular things like that I
[02:22] help them get there so whether it be
[02:24] potty training or lowering this
[02:26] self-injury all of these kind of things
[02:28] help them communicate I can't tell you
[02:30] the amount of kids I've helped uh taught
[02:32] how to talk right um all these different
[02:35] things right so that's what I do as a
[02:36] behavior analyst but our field is not
[02:39] just limited to small children or um
[02:42] children with autism we work with a wide
[02:44] variety of people but I just
[02:47] specifically specialize with those kids
[02:49] ah interesting what did you say in the
[02:51] middle high high what I did understand
[02:54] done yeah High intense maladaptive
[02:56] behaviors so a bunch of behaviors that
[02:57] are not conducive for their life or
[02:59] learning at all right so like I was
[03:02] saying the self- injury I've had a lot
[03:03] of kids that come in and parents tell me
[03:05] that hey every time I tell them it's
[03:07] it's bedtime or uh if he wants something
[03:10] he just bangs his head on the wall or he
[03:13] starts crying or he throws stuff at me
[03:14] or he bites me like I need you to help
[03:17] me control my kid or help me um know
[03:20] what he's trying to say to me you know
[03:23] so things like that is what I work
[03:25] on where does that come from is that
[03:28] just genetically in there or is that
[03:30] maybe from from the parents or is that
[03:32] like is it an unknown yeah the whole
[03:35] autism thing it it's pretty it's it's a
[03:38] big topic and it's it's pretty debated
[03:39] as well so we're not entirely sure where
[03:43] autism actually comes from and to be
[03:46] quite honest a lot of doctors don't know
[03:48] either right they'll just they just say
[03:50] it's a spectrum so it's called Autism
[03:52] Spectrum Disorder so they'll just say
[03:54] hey this kid is not performing like how
[03:56] he should perform or amongst his peers
[03:59] so we're going to say he's delayed he's
[04:00] delayed in these areas he's delayed in
[04:02] that area so obviously autism can can
[04:05] widely vary and I I've been hearing
[04:07] things recently that Elon Musk has
[04:09] autism so clearly that hasn't affected
[04:11] him or affected him in a positive way
[04:14] but either way it's it's a wide spectrum
[04:17] it can be genetic yes but a lot of
[04:19] people are also saying it's because of
[04:21] uh the foods that we've been consuming
[04:22] for the past hundred years or maybe like
[04:25] you were saying earlier the water things
[04:27] like that right or medicines we we don't
[04:29] know how these things are affecting our
[04:31] bodies and we need to be open to that
[04:33] and understand that they may be
[04:35] affecting us in some type of way right
[04:37] so I I would say if you ask me I would
[04:40] say that all of this together pretty
[04:44] much affects us because autism is
[04:46] clearly not how we're supposed to be
[04:48] functioning so I would say all of those
[04:51] things absolutely yeah I think e
[04:54] mentioned it on the Saturday night life
[04:57] I think the first time that he has I
[04:59] mean he he he definitely is a special
[05:02] character oh yeah he is he he's not
[05:06] delayed probably but he's definitely
[05:08] outside of the normal peer group right
[05:11] right right exactly the opposite of
[05:13] delay this guy doing too many things at
[05:15] once now he's doing the whole uh uh
[05:18] government efficiency thing yeah he's
[05:20] got a lot going on I imagine he does the
[05:23] same thing to the USA actually than he
[05:26] did to Twitter just like throwing out
[05:28] 80% of the people and it still BRS I I
[05:32] wouldn't be opposed to that I'm not
[05:33] going to lie I like that there's a lot
[05:35] of there's a lot of waste in our
[05:37] government I'm sure that we can all
[05:38] agree on that absolutely yeah and now
[05:41] you wrote uh or wait you wrote or you
[05:44] are in the progress of writing a book
[05:47] about that I was writing and now I'm
[05:50] officially done but I finished the last
[05:52] chapter I'm officially done but I
[05:54] actually have to find an editor right
[05:56] because I do want to go the whole
[05:57] traditional route I don't have an
[05:59] amazing following on u x or Instagram or
[06:02] anything like that so I'm hoping that
[06:04] the traditional route will you know get
[06:06] my book exposure and then uh get my
[06:08] message across to the world so I am
[06:10] looking into that I edit it myself but
[06:13] um I don't know how great that actually
[06:15] is but I did it and I'm going to get a
[06:17] professional one and that's it and then
[06:19] I'm completely done and what is the book
[06:23] now about is it like the behavioral
[06:25] changes and then with with Bitcoin uh
[06:28] combined yeah I'd like to say that it's
[06:30] it's a lot of all of that really it's
[06:33] not just a behavioral book and it's not
[06:35] just a Bitcoin book right it what it
[06:38] really does is I'm trying to solve a
[06:41] problem here and I'm sure you know this
[06:42] was a problem Robin maybe back in the
[06:44] day you worried about orange and orange
[06:46] pilling people but I'm sure you don't
[06:48] you don't worry about that anymore every
[06:49] time you go somewhere like the gym or
[06:51] something like that you're just like hey
[06:52] dude um I don't have time I have a
[06:54] podcast you can listen to me whenever
[06:56] you want to but um yeah a lot of big
[06:59] witers do struggle with orange pilling
[07:03] people right it it's a it's a big
[07:04] problem and we actually do need to do
[07:06] that because in my field education and
[07:09] teaching people are extremely important
[07:11] right and in the past people have told
[07:14] me time and time again hey dude you're
[07:16] so good at teaching that like the whole
[07:18] Bitcoin stuff you're so good at teaching
[07:20] that you should probably do something
[07:21] about it write a book or get on a
[07:23] podcast or something like that and I'm
[07:24] just like oh I don't really know that
[07:26] much about Bitcoin but I think I know
[07:29] more than the average person so what I
[07:31] did was I spent a lot of time learning
[07:33] about Bitcoin read all the books all the
[07:35] books I'm sure you know right read all
[07:37] of them listened to thousands and
[07:39] thousands of hours of podcast and just
[07:41] um information on it until I literally
[07:46] submerged myself into the world of
[07:48] Bitcoin and then I started to understand
[07:50] a lot right so I took this power what
[07:52] everybody's telling me that I have of
[07:54] teaching and was like let me create a
[07:56] book let me write this book because
[07:58] people keep bothering me all the time
[08:00] asking me about about this thing and
[08:02] then I explain hours and hours to them
[08:04] and their lives improve and then they
[08:07] thank me and then I just realize hey I
[08:09] got to say all of this over again to
[08:10] somebody else right so I use the
[08:13] behavioral aspect of it to actually
[08:16] teach people so the whole point of my
[08:18] book really is to get people to
[08:21] understand Bitcoin without this whole
[08:23] skeptical um view on it right so I'm
[08:26] sure you know right now if you go to go
[08:29] to a grou group of people and they start
[08:31] talking about money they start talking
[08:32] about politics or they start talking
[08:34] about something that relates to bitcoin
[08:36] well actually bitcoiners can relate
[08:38] anything to bitcoin you know that but we
[08:41] find a way that we need to introduce
[08:43] Bitcoin and then we're just like oh
[08:45] actually let me not introduce it because
[08:46] all of these people are going to make
[08:47] fun of me right now and they're going to
[08:49] gang up on me right that's what you
[08:51] think but I really want to break that
[08:54] whole thing okay yes it's more prominent
[08:57] nowadays and a lot of lot more people
[08:59] people know what Bitcoin is but it's
[09:01] still like that it's still where I bring
[09:03] up the topic and everybody's like oh
[09:05] dude what are you talking about this
[09:06] scam coin or or something like that
[09:08] right so I want to break that whole
[09:10] thing and I think that all the books
[09:13] that are out right now and all the
[09:15] people trying to teach about Bitcoin are
[09:17] really relying on the whole part that
[09:20] people don't understand money and that
[09:22] is very true I'm sure you know that
[09:24] people don't understand money but that
[09:26] is not where the root problem is okay so
[09:29] yes my book does cover the whole problem
[09:31] that people don't understand money and
[09:32] then I go through the whole the start of
[09:34] that but the main problem is people
[09:38] don't know what they want okay people
[09:40] don't know what they want or they don't
[09:42] even think about what they want it's
[09:44] because they've lost the relationship
[09:46] with understanding simple things like
[09:48] these all right so as a behaviorist I
[09:50] understand that the problem with
[09:52] understanding Bitcoin starts at our
[09:54] behaviors as a behaviorist I know that
[09:56] people perform behaviors because they
[09:59] want something all right so I'm going to
[10:01] go over the quick four functions of
[10:03] behavior to you that we learned in
[10:05] Behavior Analysis all right Robin so
[10:07] follow me with this all right I'd like
[10:09] for you to answer these questions so if
[10:11] you're sitting at home right now and the
[10:12] doorbell rings what are you going to
[10:15] do um my my post guy has usually the uh
[10:22] the talent that he goes uh comes here
[10:24] when I have a podcast but if I don't
[10:26] have a podcast and if you have time I
[10:28] usually open him uh but I actually like
[10:30] sometimes I ignore him like 50% of the
[10:32] time because I'm too too too busy with
[10:34] work uh but yeah like usually my my
[10:37] behavior is like go to the door and and
[10:39] see who's there here go all right so
[10:41] Robin's life was a little bit more
[10:42] complicated than ours but you would
[10:44] normally go open the door right so it's
[10:47] safe to say that you wouldn't just
[10:48] randomly get up at random times during
[10:50] the day and go answer the door right
[10:52] something prompts you to do that okay
[10:55] something prompted you in your
[10:56] environment to make you want to go
[10:57] answer the door and when you do go
[11:00] perform a behavior walking to the door
[11:02] and you answer the door something is
[11:05] usually there a package is there
[11:06] someone's there a family's there
[11:08] whatever right somebody's there or in
[11:09] your case the guy you were talking about
[11:11] right so some that you ignore 50% of the
[11:13] time so somebody's there for you to
[11:15] answer the door right that is telling us
[11:18] that we don't perform behaviors randomly
[11:20] so I need to go through the rest of them
[11:22] too that is for the function of access
[11:25] you're trying to access whatever it is
[11:28] or whoever it is at the door okay the
[11:31] next thing um you can think of is a
[11:33] little kid because I work with kids
[11:35] right a kid right now maybe um maybe he
[11:39] sees his favorite toy at the grocery
[11:41] store or not the grocery store whatever
[11:43] some store right you see at the toy
[11:45] store um Toys R R Us is is not here
[11:47] anymore but let's just say Toys R R Us
[11:50] the toy is there on the Shelf it's their
[11:51] favorite toy they want it really bad
[11:53] right if a kid can't communicate their
[11:56] wants they're probably going to throw a
[11:58] tantrum cry or do something or say hey
[12:00] look I want that thing right but they
[12:02] can't communicate it so they're going to
[12:03] engage in the behavior to get them to
[12:05] get that thing now in the past the
[12:08] parent probably learns that hey he won't
[12:10] stop crying unless I get him this toy so
[12:12] the parent probably going to get him the
[12:14] toy right so that behavior even though
[12:17] it's a maladaptive
[12:19] Behavior he engages in it to receive
[12:21] something all right now another kid
[12:23] might say Mom can I please have that toy
[12:25] and he'll probably also get the toy all
[12:27] right but he's doing a behavior because
[12:29] he wants something all right now think
[12:32] think about it this way what are you
[12:34] going to do robin if you feel an itch on
[12:37] your head right now what are you gonna
[12:39] do uh because in the podcast I usually
[12:42] try to avoid it but uh I will probably
[12:44] touch my face yeah you're probably gonna
[12:46] scratch it right you're gonna just go
[12:48] like that okay now you don't do that
[12:50] just because because you feel like it
[12:53] right you do it because you felt
[12:54] something and in the past in your
[12:56] learning history as a human you've
[12:58] learned that if have an itch and you
[13:00] touch it or you go like that it
[13:02] disappears The Comfort disappears so
[13:05] what you're doing there is you're trying
[13:06] to escape from something you're escaping
[13:09] discomfort okay so so far we have access
[13:12] and the next one here is escape all
[13:14] right here's another thing I'm going to
[13:16] use a little kid for you as an example
[13:18] um the teacher at school presents a
[13:21] worksheet for the child to complete the
[13:23] child doesn't want to do it the child
[13:25] says the FW the child gets thrown out of
[13:27] the room and goes to the principal
[13:29] office but guess what the kid is smiling
[13:31] because he doesn't have to do that
[13:32] worksheet anymore so the child continues
[13:34] to do this over and over every single
[13:36] day in class because he's learned that
[13:39] if I engage in a behavior or cursing
[13:41] behavior I'm going to get to escape
[13:43] doing this work okay so again a child is
[13:47] put into a situation in his environment
[13:49] and he performs a behavior that he knows
[13:51] will be reinforced right doesn't have to
[13:53] be a good thing it can just be anything
[13:55] all right so so far that is access
[13:58] Escape and the next one is attention all
[14:01] right I can see you on the street Robin
[14:04] and I can say hey excuse me Robin hey
[14:06] remember me and you might turn around
[14:08] and I got your attention like that right
[14:10] but now think about the Instagram models
[14:12] who post a bunch of pictures of
[14:13] themselves online they're also getting
[14:15] likes right those likes are attention
[14:19] right in the form of just virtual little
[14:21] clicks another thing is in high school I
[14:24] remember a lot of girls who used to say
[14:26] things like oh I'm so ugly or I look so
[14:29] fat right why do you think those people
[14:31] do that because other people around them
[14:34] are going to be like no you don't look
[14:36] fat you don't look ugly you look great
[14:38] right all those kind of things that's
[14:40] that's attention so they're looking for
[14:42] compliments those things that those
[14:44] girls said
[14:46] was trying to get them for trying to get
[14:49] compliments from people right so
[14:51] everything that we
[14:52] do in the envir that we see in the
[14:54] environment triggers us to do these
[14:56] behaviors that gives us something that
[14:58] we want right because as humans we want
[15:01] things all right that's just the way it
[15:02] goes and lastly there is sensory reasons
[15:06] so those are four things so far right
[15:08] the sensory reasons I may be tapping my
[15:10] feet the whole time through this whole
[15:12] podcast right now Robin and you don't
[15:13] even know that but I'm doing it for
[15:15] sensory Reasons I'm not looking for your
[15:16] attention I'm not looking for access
[15:18] from something or I'm not trying to
[15:19] escape anything what I'm doing is it
[15:21] just feels good to me the same thing
[15:23] with me clicking my pen it just feels
[15:25] good to me so everything every single
[15:28] behavior that you perform in I perform
[15:30] or animals any living organism on Earth
[15:35] performs a behavior for one of these
[15:37] four functions okay now these are
[15:39] umbrella terms and I gave you quick
[15:41] examples but every single one of these
[15:43] behaviors that we do fall under one of
[15:46] these things okay now if we take that
[15:50] into consideration everything that I've
[15:51] said so far that everything that we
[15:54] do gives us something that we want why
[15:57] is it that people people go out in life
[16:01] aimlessly they don't know what they're
[16:03] doing they're doing things randomly you
[16:05] ask a you ask a 17-year-old kid nowadays
[16:07] hey why do you work at this grocery
[16:09] store I don't know my uh to pay for my
[16:11] car I guess yeah okay so why did you get
[16:14] a car oh to go to work I guess yeah it
[16:18] doesn't make any sense right this is the
[16:20] things that they do because they have no
[16:22] plans for themselves and they don't know
[16:24] what they actually want okay some people
[16:27] might even pick an occupation just
[16:28] because they're parents told them to
[16:29] pick that thing right hey I want I'm
[16:31] Indian so I know you got to be a doctor
[16:33] or you get shunned from the family right
[16:35] so I understand people pick these
[16:39] certain occupations just because other
[16:41] people are leading and controlling their
[16:43] lives for them so you have to understand
[16:45] what you want yourself all right we have
[16:47] to understand those simple things all
[16:48] right now I believe that the point of
[16:52] life is to fulfill a duty all right we
[16:55] all have to create value somehow whether
[16:57] it's you're creating value or fulfilling
[16:59] a duty for your family the world or
[17:01] yourself you have to do something there
[17:04] needs to be some kind of ultimate goal
[17:06] in life all right and you have to
[17:08] understand what those things are right
[17:10] and if you don't understand any of these
[17:11] things you're not going to understand
[17:13] the most important behavior that a human
[17:16] can engage in all right and that's what
[17:19] I'm saying as a behavior analyst I think
[17:22] the most important behavior that a human
[17:24] can ever engage in is saving okay saving
[17:29] now yes that may be a broad term but I
[17:32] have to tell you exactly what saving
[17:34] means right because some people might
[17:36] say what am I going to save for you know
[17:37] you hear these stupid things this YOLO
[17:39] movement or whatever hey you only live
[17:41] once whatever whatever yeah that's
[17:42] completely stupid I think people with
[17:45] lower intelligence think like that that
[17:47] you need to think that you need to live
[17:49] for now all right what happens if you
[17:51] accidentally live for 20 years Robin are
[17:53] you going to be mad about that you're
[17:54] going to be like dang I I did all this
[17:56] YOLO stuff and I'm still alive that
[17:58] sucks right yeah that's not how you're
[18:00] supposed to live your life okay because
[18:03] when you save all right this is going to
[18:05] go back to the four functions we were
[18:06] talking about Robin when you save you
[18:10] are delaying gratification delay of
[18:13] gratification is the ultimate behavior
[18:16] that is ingrained in our DNA all right
[18:19] this
[18:21] superpower let leads us to delay all of
[18:25] the things that we can be getting right
[18:27] now so we can get tfold in the future
[18:31] all right now if I say hey I can spend
[18:35] $100,000 and buy a cyber truck right now
[18:38] right or I can let's just say if I was
[18:42] investing right I'll get to investing
[18:43] later but say if I was investing I'll
[18:45] put $100,000 into Tesla and I can get 50
[18:49] cyber trucks later right I can get 50
[18:52] cyber trucks later I can move out of
[18:53] this country I can go live somewhere
[18:55] else I can get a house I can put all my
[18:56] kids through college I can do all of
[18:58] these things all right as opposed to
[19:01] just taking that one cyber truck right
[19:03] now okay now I know that's a little
[19:06] simple what I'm saying right there right
[19:08] but the whole point of that is is that
[19:10] you need to control yourself you need to
[19:13] know that don't just do these things
[19:15] just because they're in front of you
[19:17] that's like thinking like a squirrel a
[19:18] squirrel just moves based off of what's
[19:20] going on in front of them right now they
[19:22] engage in something they're just like oh
[19:24] something else and then I'm going to go
[19:25] over there okay that's how we are
[19:28] growing up up in this world right now
[19:29] and it's terrible for our species okay
[19:32] so I make an argument in my book that we
[19:34] all once had this amazing superpower
[19:37] which is the ability to delay
[19:39] gratification right I use this example
[19:41] of where a caveman probably uh you know
[19:45] hunts today to dry meat to eat in the
[19:49] future right that's the ability to
[19:53] understand that I need to live for the
[19:55] future or what about Farmers Farmers
[19:57] they rotate their crop they rotate their
[19:59] fields right they don't use all of their
[20:02] fields and their soil right now today
[20:04] because they know that if I use it today
[20:05] I won't be able to use it in the next
[20:07] season all right all of these things are
[20:10] showing us that we're we're able to
[20:12] delay gratification all right and we're
[20:14] losing that thing all right Robin so
[20:17] when it comes to the functions I was
[20:19] just talking about you can't access any
[20:21] of those functions in the future or all
[20:23] four of those functions in the future
[20:25] because you're giving into one of them
[20:26] right now all right now back to what I
[20:29] was saying that the ultimate behavior
[20:31] that a human can do is save their time
[20:33] and
[20:34] energy people are so hooked on this
[20:38] immediate reinforcement nowadays just
[20:40] think about Uber you want to do Uber
[20:43] Eats I'm I'm hungry I need my food right
[20:45] now so I have to I have to Uber it or
[20:47] hey I'm bored I need to take Instagram
[20:49] out and I need to start scrolling right
[20:51] now so my dopamine can hit so I can feel
[20:53] better right we're we're literally
[20:54] addicts right this is like worse than
[20:57] drugs and and then you have these people
[21:01] who are like hey um I really want to
[21:03] work on my body and I want to get a
[21:05] girlfriend I want to do these things
[21:07] actually forget about it I'm just going
[21:08] to type in my um Crush online and type
[21:11] in naked and let's see her naked right
[21:13] now that's how the world is right now
[21:15] okay everything is immediate to us this
[21:17] is a problem because what this is doing
[21:20] is it's making all of these long-term
[21:22] contingencies that we used to have in
[21:24] our life all shortterm now all right so
[21:28] in the past I had to go walk up to or
[21:30] let's just say my grandpa right he had
[21:32] to go walk up to a girl in the grocery
[21:34] store compliment her work on his body
[21:37] work on getting money and maybe asking
[21:40] her out and saying hey look um you want
[21:42] to go out on a date and then maybe um go
[21:45] on a couple dates and and then hopefully
[21:47] he would actually get to procreate okay
[21:50] so that's usually what has happened but
[21:53] now men nowadays we're not worried about
[21:55] that women nowadays are not worried
[21:57] about the ention of one guy they're
[22:00] worried about posting a picture online
[22:01] and getting a million likes right so how
[22:04] can you compete with all of these things
[22:05] today how can you compete with having to
[22:07] go hunt for your own food cooking your
[22:09] own food when you can just Uber it my
[22:11] little brother he orders Uber every
[22:13] single day every single day this guy's
[22:15] got like some chicken tick Masala or
[22:17] he's got some some Spanish food I don't
[22:19] know what he's got Chick-fil-A he's
[22:21] doing this every single day now this is
[22:23] a problem all right because this is
[22:26] making us think that our our savings and
[22:30] our investing should work the exact same
[22:32] way because humans are no longer happy
[22:36] with having to wait 15 years for
[22:38] something we can't even wait 15 minutes
[22:40] for food so we're like um how can we do
[22:43] this as fast as possible I see all of
[22:45] these people online they have cyber
[22:47] trucks they have all these things they
[22:49] have all these nice mansions and all
[22:50] these gold chains and whatnot what can I
[22:52] do to get that quickly oh yeah I can
[22:55] invest in this thing that my friend was
[22:56] telling me about that 10 X's overnight
[22:59] right you want it to be immediate you
[23:02] want it to be just like all the
[23:03] behaviors that we engage in in our life
[23:06] right now immediately but this is a
[23:09] problem I want people to understand that
[23:10] this is not natural internet all these
[23:13] kind of things are not natural I I use
[23:14] the internet Robin I'm using the
[23:16] internet with you right now right I
[23:18] understand that I understand that all
[23:19] these things are important but you have
[23:21] to understand that saving and money does
[23:24] not work the same way that all these
[23:25] behaviors work all right so this leads
[23:28] me up to the biggest thing that I wanted
[23:30] to talk about and that's obviously
[23:32] Bitcoin Bitcoin is the ultimate savings
[23:36] unit this is literally the memory card
[23:39] of your life okay I remember back in the
[23:42] day when I had a PS2 I don't know did
[23:43] you have a PS2
[23:45] Robin um I'm not sure which one but I
[23:48] think a PS2 yeah I had one I definitely
[23:50] want maybe PS3 I I don't know which one
[23:52] it was but I think it was a PS2 yeah all
[23:54] right so my parents were a little
[23:56] different I had a PlayStation 2 when I
[23:57] was 5 years old old and they bought me
[23:59] Grand Theft Auto I know that's a good
[24:01] idea right I I love I love that game so
[24:04] much yeah I played Grand Theft Auto five
[24:07] so much and I'm afraid when the six one
[24:09] comes out the the podcast streak will
[24:13] end I understand I understand but um
[24:16] yeah I loved Grand Theft since I was
[24:18] five years old don't worry I didn't do
[24:19] anything crazy I didn't do anything bad
[24:21] my parents trusted me or maybe they just
[24:23] didn't know what it was and I tricked
[24:24] them but either way I got Grand Theft 5
[24:27] oh not Grand Theft a 5 one of the
[24:28] earlier Grand Theft AOS right and I used
[24:29] to play Grand Theft Auto all the time
[24:32] now I used to have a problem on my PS2
[24:35] where every day I wake up and I play
[24:38] Grand theato I have to start from the
[24:41] beginning right because a PS2 doesn't
[24:44] have a built-in memory card like a
[24:45] PlayStation 5 right so every day I would
[24:48] start Grand Theft 5 or Grand Theft I
[24:50] keep saying five grand theut I would
[24:53] have to start over start over do the
[24:55] same Mission over and over again over
[24:56] and over again and I would waste a lot
[24:58] of time and energy doing that
[25:01] now my dad bought me a little PS2 memory
[25:04] card this was an 8 megabyte memory card
[25:07] the one that you plug into the
[25:08] PlayStation 2 right and this was a
[25:10] GameChanger so all of my video games
[25:12] every time I played I can pick back up
[25:15] where I left off and I didn't have to
[25:17] waste time doing all these things I I
[25:19] used to do before to get to the third
[25:21] mission or get to the fourth mission
[25:23] right now the memory card is just like
[25:26] Bitcoin Bitcoin is the memory card of
[25:28] Our Lives there's nothing right now that
[25:31] we can say with confidence that we can
[25:34] save our time and energy in there's
[25:37] nothing people people have used houses
[25:39] people have used gold people have used
[25:41] all of these things throughout history
[25:43] but it always gets inflated that's the
[25:46] problem these things can't be savings
[25:49] units because they leak energy houses
[25:53] erode houses you need to fix something
[25:56] there's repairs whatever people can
[25:57] raise their tax on houses right you
[26:00] can't store your energy in something
[26:02] like that it literally makes no sense
[26:04] yes you can make millions of dollars or
[26:05] whatever but yeah then you can sell your
[26:07] house for a million dollars and then you
[26:08] have to buy another house for a million
[26:09] dollars how much sense does that make
[26:11] doesn't make any sense right so we need
[26:13] a memory card in our life and Bitcoin is
[26:15] exactly what that is it has scarcity it
[26:17] has value it's a technology that people
[26:21] really need to look into theirself
[26:23] because I can't explain that in
[26:24] literally 30 minutes and you know that
[26:26] too right it's a lot of learning and you
[26:28] look into Bitcoin you're going to learn
[26:29] more and more every single day right but
[26:32] for now you can take the advice of all
[26:34] the people who have already done all
[26:36] those things that this is the sure thing
[26:40] this is the big deal you are living in a
[26:43] time where humans can finally save for
[26:47] the first time ever in history and what
[26:51] do you say oh yeah I'll buy it later
[26:54] yeah that's the dumbest thing I've ever
[26:55] heard I can't believe that we still have
[26:57] to to explain this to people right so
[27:00] pretty much that's what my book is about
[27:01] right I want people to understand that
[27:04] they are not investors all right I'm not
[27:06] sure what you guys have set up over
[27:08] there but we have I'm sure you're
[27:09] familiar with the 401K and the Roth IRA
[27:11] everything that we have here these
[27:12] retirement accounts what do you think
[27:14] all of those things are investing in
[27:17] companies all of these other things your
[27:19] employer sets this up the government
[27:20] sets this up for you because they know
[27:22] you're going to be dirt poor by the end
[27:25] of the time when you're ready to retire
[27:27] you're going to be dirt poor if you hold
[27:28] on to your cash all right so they give
[27:31] you these things to make you feel like
[27:33] you're you're getting somewhere oh yeah
[27:34] look my ,000 it turned into into $2,000
[27:37] it only took 20 years for that to happen
[27:38] right so they're so excited about these
[27:41] little things that everybody's an
[27:44] investor all of a sudden everybody has
[27:45] Robin Hood on their on their phones and
[27:47] all these kind of things well I hate to
[27:49] break it to all these people you're not
[27:52] investors I've traded for many years so
[27:55] far I know I'm still young but I've been
[27:57] trading I've been trading for quite a
[27:58] while or before at least I want to make
[28:00] that clear before I used to trade right
[28:03] I used to trade and I was like yeah I'm
[28:05] the man dude I have cracked the code on
[28:08] life that you can just trade and
[28:10] inflation's on my side and all these
[28:12] things are going to raise but then what
[28:14] happens when a CEO says something stupid
[28:17] your stock value drops okay what happens
[28:19] when the earnings comes out the earnings
[28:21] doesn't even have to be bad the stock
[28:23] drops right do you think that your
[28:25] savings your time and energy should be
[28:27] in something like like that no that's
[28:29] stupid you can't keep something in there
[28:31] you need the hardest asset known to man
[28:34] and that is Bitcoin this is your memory
[28:36] card this is where you need to save
[28:38] you're not an investor all right unless
[28:39] you wanted to dedicate your life to
[28:41] investing you can do that but you're not
[28:43] an investor you're a police officer
[28:45] you're a cashier you're a podcaster
[28:47] you're an influencer you're supposed to
[28:49] be doing those things you're supposed to
[28:50] be creating value in this world and
[28:53] saving it in a memory card so you don't
[28:55] have to wake up in the morning and start
[28:57] this all over again okay but
[28:59] unfortunately that's what people are
[29:01] doing every single day aimlessly they
[29:03] don't know what they're doing they don't
[29:04] know what they want in life because no
[29:07] one is teaching them about money they
[29:09] don't understand these things right and
[29:11] bitcoiners are really trying our best to
[29:13] teach these things to you people but
[29:15] you're making it really hard for us by
[29:17] calling us scammers and doing all these
[29:19] things right so I hope that people have
[29:21] an open mind with this book I start off
[29:24] a very subtle way and ease people into
[29:27] the
[29:28] to not just jump on them and be like hey
[29:30] you need you need to know what Bitcoin
[29:31] is right now or you're stupid right I
[29:33] don't do that right I started off in
[29:35] saying hey look this is money this is
[29:37] what money actually is this is what you
[29:39] actually want in life you need to think
[29:41] about those things and look I'm going to
[29:43] offer you something that worked the best
[29:45] in history now start thinking for
[29:48] yourselves and I use a lot of analogies
[29:50] throughout the book because I think
[29:51] that's the best way for people to
[29:52] understand something right because if I
[29:55] just throw a topic at someone they're
[29:56] not going to know what I'm talking about
[29:57] they're not not going to care right so
[29:59] when I used to orange pill people I used
[30:00] to do it in the sauna right I'll just be
[30:02] in the sauna and then this guy sitting
[30:03] next to me and I'm just like I don't
[30:04] want to stare at this guy for the next
[30:06] 30 minutes so let me just talk about
[30:08] Bitcoin right and then by the time I
[30:11] leave or by the time they leave they're
[30:12] a bitcoiner man they they already
[30:14] understand what's going on and they're
[30:16] like hey dude I'm going to invest in
[30:17] that now when I go to the sauna every
[30:19] time I'm at the gym I don't even
[30:20] remember these people and they tell me
[30:21] hey dude Bitcoin is
[30:24] $999,000 right and I'm like yeah I told
[30:27] you man this is this is this is it right
[30:30] so I'm trying to explain these things to
[30:32] people you're not you're not an investor
[30:35] you are a police officer you're a
[30:37] surgeon you're cashier you're this thing
[30:40] right focus on those things create value
[30:43] through those things save your time and
[30:45] energy in life and work to use this time
[30:48] and energy to do what you're supposed to
[30:51] be doing because I'm not saying that
[30:52] you're a cashier right now and you're
[30:53] supposed to be a cashier for the rest of
[30:54] your life right that's not what I'm
[30:56] saying I'm saying you need to use a
[30:58] skill that you have right now to save to
[31:00] propel yourself so you can actually do
[31:02] what you're supposed to do all right and
[31:04] I'm sorry Robin but let's think about it
[31:06] like this I want to change the world all
[31:08] right and that's what I'm going to work
[31:10] on okay I have the ways that I want to
[31:11] change the world and I've even written
[31:13] some of it down inside my book and
[31:15] that's what I'm going to do all right if
[31:17] somebody wants to make a lot of money
[31:20] because they want to spend it all on
[31:23] strippers in Las Vegas that's what they
[31:26] want to do that's what they want to to
[31:28] do okay I have nothing to do with that
[31:29] I'm not going to say you're a bad person
[31:31] but at least know what you want right
[31:33] you have to know what you want all right
[31:35] I'm sure by the time you go through the
[31:37] whole Bitcoin Journey your whole
[31:38] stripper thing would change in your mind
[31:39] but I'm just saying if that's where you
[31:41] want to start start that way all right
[31:43] because I have no problem with that you
[31:44] need to know what you want and you need
[31:46] to save you need to understand that this
[31:49] ability has been given to us by our
[31:51] creator it doesn't matter what your
[31:52] spiritual beliefs are your creator or
[31:55] whoever created you or what created you
[31:58] has embedded delay of gratification as a
[32:01] superpower for you and shown you a way
[32:03] that you can save and that way I put in
[32:05] a simple formula in my book and that is
[32:08] through time okay we always hear that
[32:11] time is the most important thing that we
[32:12] have it's our most important asset and
[32:14] yes I do agree but I don't agree with
[32:16] this people say that time disappears
[32:19] Robin time does not disappear because
[32:21] think about it like
[32:22] this time is dormant energy all right we
[32:26] hear this all the time about
[32:28] energy cannot be created and it cannot
[32:30] be destroyed time is dormant energy
[32:33] that's where all of this energy comes
[32:35] from time is dormant energy it turns
[32:39] into expended energy when we do things
[32:43] when we do behaviors and when we do
[32:45] these behaviors it turns into stored
[32:48] energy all right so for example right
[32:52] now I'm alive this is the time that my
[32:54] creator has given to me when I go to
[32:56] work and I make money money I am using
[33:00] my energy to receive energy okay this
[33:04] hot energy right now which is Cash
[33:06] because it's inflating this hot energy I
[33:09] can put this hot energy into the hardest
[33:12] asset known to man Bitcoin and that is
[33:15] now stored energy all right and when I
[33:18] store this energy I've have literally
[33:20] just bought my time back because now I
[33:23] don't have to work until I'm 70 years
[33:25] old I can work till I'm 35 years old or
[33:28] till I'm 30 years old and I can stop
[33:30] right there and I have all of that time
[33:33] to myself to do what I want to do and
[33:36] yes I can start um working again and and
[33:38] and creating value for the world but
[33:41] that's for me to say not for inflation
[33:43] to say not for my boss to say and not
[33:44] for anyone one else to say all right so
[33:47] that's how you buy your time back all
[33:49] right and time doesn't just disappear
[33:52] yes we all have a finite time that's
[33:55] going to end at some point but think
[33:57] think about it metaphorically you have
[34:00] all your time back just by
[34:03] Saving All right so that's pretty much
[34:06] what my book is trying to say that you
[34:09] already have the superpower dude you
[34:11] just need to do it you just need the
[34:12] right asset to do it in there's no asset
[34:16] in ever that complemented the power that
[34:19] we have now there is an asset to do that
[34:22] and you are going to be really sorry if
[34:24] you miss out on this thing I partnered
[34:27] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[34:31] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:33] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:36] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:39] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[34:42] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[34:45] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:48] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[34:51] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[34:54] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:58] watch collections you have the date of

[36:40] perfect representation of that time that
[36:43] I love that a lot it's really cool and
[36:45] there's also I think it shines a light
[36:46] on uh what what you said earlier uh with
[36:51] the traps that the Fiat system has with
[36:54] the High Time preference where you
[36:56] getting consumerism get on social media
[36:59] where people just try to build the
[37:02] perfect Digital Life even with video
[37:04] games I I I see people that have a
[37:07] miserable life uh and in the real world
[37:10] they really try to be the billionaire in
[37:12] a video game they try to have all those
[37:14] cars I think Grand the auto is a perfect
[37:17] game to compare that to they do all
[37:19] those crazy and great in the video
[37:22] game but then in real life they don't do
[37:24] anything exciting they don't do anything
[37:27] that's worth living for so uh I think
[37:30] that's a lot it has a lot to do with
[37:32] with with money and it has a lot to do
[37:34] with incentives and behaviors uh and and
[37:37] you you did an amazing job of
[37:39] highlighting exactly what's going on in
[37:42] Bitcoin I'm really looking forward to
[37:43] the to the book and and seeing what it's
[37:45] all about because I think it could be a
[37:47] really good one um yeah you you
[37:50] mentioned a whole whole lot of things
[37:53] things that things that I wanted to ask
[37:55] and then you answered it really good
[37:57] actually before uh one thing um which
[38:00] was interesting for me when you talked
[38:02] about this four behaviors I think this
[38:04] Escape uh
[38:06] attention yeah those four was really
[38:09] interesting uh where we come to the
[38:11] point where different bitcoiners have
[38:14] different reasons for getting into
[38:16] Bitcoin for example Donald Trump has a
[38:19] completely different reason for being
[38:21] all of a sudden for Bitcoin than uh I
[38:25] had in the beginning I want to do be
[38:28] freaking rich and that's why I first got
[38:31] into Bitcoin Donald Trump wanted to be
[38:34] elected that's why he got in Bitcoin is
[38:37] that kind of the I wanted to have the
[38:39] access and he the attention can you uh
[38:42] get back to those behaviors with
[38:45] different uh intentions yeah I'd love to
[38:48] explain that so first of all you said
[38:50] that you wanted to be Filthy Rich right
[38:53] now I don't think that you just wanted
[38:55] to be rich there could have been so many
[38:57] functions involved or tied with being
[39:00] rich so for example you could probably
[39:02] hate where you live right now pretend
[39:04] that's the neighborhood you live in
[39:05] you've grow you've grown up there all
[39:07] your life and you just hate it so much
[39:08] there's so much crime and all these kind
[39:10] of things well becoming rich Robin
[39:14] actually gets you to escape that um that
[39:19] neighborhood that you live in because
[39:20] you couldn't afford you couldn't afford
[39:22] any other neighborhood in Life or access
[39:25] to a bunch of um different toys that you
[39:28] wanted like a cyber truck I keep saying
[39:30] a cyber truck hopefully Elon Musk post
[39:32] me or something like that so um you want
[39:35] the Cyber truck all right fine you got
[39:38] me I do want a cyber truck
[39:41] Robin I do want a cyber truck but I'm
[39:43] thinking like that right now do I buy a
[39:44] cyber truck right now or do I buy a
[39:46] hundred cyber trucks later right so
[39:48] that's how you got to think so yeah it's
[39:50] not available in Europe so I it would be
[39:53] a nice car for me too but it's not even
[39:55] available so unfortunately I don't have
[39:57] to think about it there you go so um
[40:00] that's funny side story about cybertruck
[40:03] sorry but um in my country right the
[40:06] Cyber truck so Guyana is where my
[40:08] parents are from there's one cyber truck
[40:10] in there right now wa wait what what is
[40:12] that diyana Guana it's in South America
[40:16] oh okay yeah so um there's one cyber
[40:19] truck there right now this is a very
[40:21] poor country by the way hopefully they
[40:22] adopt Bitcoin in the future but anyways
[40:24] or maybe I I should probably have
[40:25] something to do with that they have one
[40:27] cybertruck there right now and it every
[40:30] time it charges it pulls all of the
[40:33] current in the whole village and
[40:34] everybody has no power for
[40:39] hours so that's really bad but in the
[40:42] future I'm hoping it's a lot better but
[40:43] anyways back to the question that you
[40:45] said sorry about that I got sidetracked
[40:47] now um yes you can have multiple
[40:50] functions from becoming rich and that's
[40:52] kind of what I was talking about
[40:53] remember right now Robin you could you
[40:57] can go rob a bank right now and be
[40:59] really rich that'll get you the same
[41:00] outcome but what are you going to do
[41:02] with the money that $500 that you steal
[41:04] you're going to go buy some sneakers or
[41:06] something like that right but you said
[41:08] that you wanted to be a bitcoiner and
[41:09] you wanted to save and you want to
[41:10] become Filthy Rich and you have a whole
[41:14] bunch of functions tied to that access
[41:16] to all the different things that you're
[41:17] going to get the attention that you're
[41:19] probably going to get online if you want
[41:20] to post that you you're really rich and
[41:22] whatnot and the escape from the
[41:24] neighborhood that you don't want to live
[41:25] in anymore right so there's a bunch of
[41:27] functions tied to it that's what I was
[41:29] talking about that's the importance of
[41:31] all of those things right now Donald
[41:34] Trump for example may have had a
[41:36] shorttime preference with his whole um
[41:39] wanting to adopt the whole Bitcoin thing
[41:40] right I don't think he has bad
[41:42] intentions to be honest right I like
[41:44] what he's pushing and all that kind of
[41:45] stuff so I don't think he has bad
[41:47] intentions but yes he could have just
[41:50] adopted Bitcoin for now because he
[41:52] wanted access to more voters or he
[41:55] wanted attention
[41:57] in the form of people bitcoiners
[41:59] recognizing him and saying hey hm I'm
[42:02] going to vote for that guy because he's
[42:03] talking about Bitcoin and I probably
[42:05] wouldn't have voted anyways you know
[42:07] what I mean so yes it does tie to a
[42:09] function it can be multiple functions
[42:12] but if we really you know Dove down deep
[42:15] into this whole thing we could find the
[42:16] one that it's actually tied to
[42:18] absolutely yeah it's it's it's super
[42:20] interesting for me uh how and why people
[42:24] buy Bitcoin and it it kind of follows me
[42:26] around because I've been vocal about
[42:28] Bitcoin now since four years in my
[42:31] personal circles uh in online since
[42:34] around like one and a half two years I
[42:37] no actually like over two years actually
[42:39] uh online now vocal about it and now
[42:41] with the podcast one year really deep
[42:43] and every day and and and really vocal
[42:45] about it uh so everywhere I go I'm
[42:49] presented with Bitcoin like I don't have
[42:52] to bring it up people around me
[42:53] automatically bring it up because it
[42:55] it's just kind of written all over my my
[42:58] head so yeah shirt yeah I try to not
[43:04] wear bitco actually when I go do
[43:06] non-bitcoin things but some still do and
[43:10] it's always fun it opens the
[43:11] conversation and then I first of all
[43:14] learn all the the things that prevent
[43:16] people from from from entering a Bitcoin
[43:19] and then I also learn uh over time what
[43:22] they said like two years ago of Bitcoin
[43:25] uh and then like two years later they
[43:27] say like oh yeah Robin I bought the
[43:29] first thing I think you're right
[43:30] actually and I was wrong back then so so
[43:32] that I I I see that that Transformations
[43:35] and I think you're a really good orange
[43:37] pillar I think that that like if you
[43:39] talk with someone one hour you're like a
[43:41] kind of Cino sailor that you just like
[43:44] you put those two together and he comes
[43:46] out as a bitcoiner I think sailor said
[43:48] that uh recently on a podcast give me an
[43:51] hour with war Buffett in calmness and he
[43:53] comes out as a bitcoiner I think some
[43:55] something along those lines he said and
[43:57] 100% believe him by the way short
[43:59] Sidetrack I'm really I'm looking forward
[44:02] to the three minute presentation saor
[44:04] will do for Microsoft me too hopefully
[44:07] hopefully he hopefully he can orange
[44:09] pill those guys I know that um Bill
[44:11] Gates is really against it but I'm not
[44:13] sure how much pull he has in Microsoft
[44:14] nowadays but uh we'll see we'll see what
[44:16] happens hopefully he can because hey man
[44:19] um this 100K that we're that we keep
[44:21] tapping right now this cell wall um I'm
[44:24] sure it's going to be broken right after
[44:25] that you know what I mean but hopefully
[44:27] this weekend hopefully this weekend yeah
[44:29] when when this podcast comes out we are
[44:32] very likely above 100K because it will
[44:36] come out like in a week or 10 days or
[44:38] something like that so I I have a hard
[44:41] time thinking of when this comes out
[44:43] we're not already ready over it I keep
[44:45] watching it the whole day since I do
[44:47] podcasting because uh if if we actually
[44:50] crack the 100K on on podcast then I have
[44:52] to switch a little bit to topics oh yeah
[44:56] I would be 100% fine with that trust me
[44:59] you can say you can do that whole thing
[45:01] to me um with Kanye West when he came on
[45:03] he said hey Dylan all of that stuff it
[45:05] sounds good but Bitcoin just hit 100K he
[45:08] did that
[45:08] to that that's that that's true I I just
[45:12] wanted to find out what voting power
[45:14] actually Bill Gates has but I think he
[45:15] has a lot uh I think there's like Steve
[45:19] Palmer has 4.5 I think he wait Bill
[45:23] Gates only has
[45:24] 0.5% is that
[45:27] 0. 0.5 I don't know if that's correct
[45:30] it's just like a news article I just saw
[45:33] but I know that black rock has around
[45:36] 10% yeah and and they they have a
[45:38] product to sell with the Bitcoin ETF so
[45:40] they they are probably incentivized to
[45:42] sell them Bitcoin but yeah it will will
[45:44] be fun fun uh fun time Microsoft I think
[45:48] no matter what they decide it's it's
[45:50] really meaningful because they have to
[45:52] decide one way or another and then we
[45:54] have that timestamp in Microsoft history
[45:58] uh and if they didn't adopt it we can
[46:00] point back in two years like hey see how
[46:03] much money you could have made it if you
[46:05] adopted it back then and if they adopt
[46:07] it then uh the success story will
[46:11] anyways be be be known so I think that
[46:15] that there's a voting like that in
[46:17] itself no matter the outcome is already
[46:20] very positive and very uh very nice for
[46:23] for for Bitcoin I completely forgot
[46:25] where I wanted to go I think got Sidra
[46:28] sidetracked too much with with
[46:31] that yeah where where did we went uh I
[46:34] forgot well you did ask me about the
[46:36] whole functions how it related to you
[46:38] and Donald Trump but I would like to say
[46:41] about the Microsoft thing um I would
[46:43] enjoy in the future that we can make fun
[46:46] of them like we make fun of Germany
[46:48] right now for selling their
[46:50] Bitcoin yeah it hurts my heart yeah they
[46:55] s like in a very bad
[46:57] timing basically triggered with their
[46:59] sell order the whole bull
[47:02] market yes so you did you were talking
[47:05] about the four functions of behavior
[47:06] Donald Trump and you absolutely yeah I
[47:09] have no clue where I was going with that
[47:11] so I forgot that maybe it comes up later
[47:14] but yeah one one thing that I was also
[47:16] curious about what kind of oh yes I I
[47:19] was actually going to that um when we
[47:22] talk about uh Behavioral Analyst and and
[47:24] you know why people do certain things
[47:27] and and you can analyze that um what do
[47:29] you think are the the major challenges
[47:32] ahead of us uh for people getting into
[47:34] Bitcoin like what what is now preventing
[47:38] 99% of the people uh that that maybe
[47:42] heard about Bitcoin maybe are even aware
[47:44] that it's going up great in price maybe
[47:46] even aware of of Donald Trump and stuff
[47:47] like that uh but they still like the
[47:50] they cannot get WRA the head around it
[47:52] what is
[47:54] behaviorally uh challenging them not to
[47:56] to get into Bitcoin what has to change
[47:58] there right so um half of that answer I
[48:02] would think would be answered in my book
[48:04] where I talk about people are not tying
[48:07] Bitcoin to their lives right so once you
[48:10] tie Bitcoin to your life yeah you may
[48:11] not like Bitcoin you may not like
[48:13] technology you don't care about saving
[48:15] and all those kind of things but you do
[48:17] care about what you care about in life
[48:19] right so if you can tie Bitcoin to that
[48:23] then you can get people over this hurdle
[48:25] about oh actually Bitcoin does relate to
[48:27] me because I want this thing in life and
[48:30] in order for me to get that thing I need
[48:32] money money is the universal or money is
[48:36] only the universal currency right now
[48:38] because energy is the universal currency
[48:40] right and money is the best way we can
[48:42] represent our energy so once people
[48:45] realize that and realize that hey you
[48:48] need energy to get what you want in life
[48:50] they will get past that 50% but the
[48:52] other 50% from what you were saying just
[48:54] now was um the fact that Bitcoin is also
[48:57] a technology right so it's not this
[48:59] thing that uh the government or Joe
[49:01] Biden or if he's even charge Camala
[49:04] Harris whoever's in charge right
[49:05] probably Cala right who's holding him up
[49:07] like a puppet right now anyways she
[49:10] comes out and she says hey guys we're
[49:12] not gonna use the dollar anymore we're
[49:14] going to use Bitcoin or we're going to
[49:16] use this other thing then people would
[49:18] instantly trust it because hey look the
[49:20] government did it right so that means
[49:22] that everybody has to use this one now
[49:24] right so people are not seeing Bitcoin
[49:27] as this thing yet they're seeing it as a
[49:29] technology and what we've learned
[49:32] through the past hundred years or maybe
[49:35] 200 years with technology is that people
[49:36] are usually late to technology right
[49:39] obviously or else there wouldn't be so
[49:40] many few people or few PE so few people
[49:43] who are rich when it comes to investing
[49:45] in apple and Microsoft and Tesla and all
[49:47] these kind of things right because
[49:49] people display herd mentality right if I
[49:53] see a bunch of people um doing very well
[49:57] with Bitcoin maybe now I will be
[50:00] interested in dabbling into it right but
[50:05] if a lot of people are experiencing pain
[50:07] with Bitcoin what am I going to want to
[50:09] do as a as the four functions of
[50:10] behavior I want to escape pain right or
[50:13] I want to avoid pain so what I'm going
[50:14] to do is not invest in Bitcoin right so
[50:17] if I see all these people and their
[50:19] lives enhancing with Bitcoin I'm going
[50:22] to want access to all of those things as
[50:24] well all right so I think herd mentality
[50:26] to answer your question herd mentality
[50:28] is our biggest thing right now that
[50:30] people are not able to think for
[50:31] themselves and they're not going to look
[50:33] into this thing themselves right they're
[50:35] going to hear words that we're saying
[50:36] and it's going to go one ear out the
[50:38] other but if we're able to relate
[50:42] Bitcoin to their lives you're going to
[50:44] make people start to listen and they're
[50:46] going to be like hey wait I care about
[50:49] um solving um world hunger let me hear
[50:52] what this bitcoiner guy has to say oh
[50:55] this can help me solve world hunger all
[50:57] right then I'm going to start to start
[50:59] to pay attention to what this guy is
[51:00] saying right so we have to get past the
[51:02] fact that this is a new technology and
[51:04] explain it a little bit more to people
[51:06] right because I watched a uh I watched a
[51:09] YouTube clip I'm not sure if you've seen
[51:10] it before it's where Bill Gates goes on
[51:13] I am not endorsing Bill Gates but if you
[51:16] went on um he went on David Letterman
[51:19] show I believe it was the Late Night
[51:21] with David Letterman did you watch that
[51:22] clip what I'm referring to here I I I
[51:25] I'm not sure uh okay so what he does in
[51:28] the clip is he's basically talking about
[51:30] the internet that's that's this new
[51:32] Revolution and he's talking about um
[51:34] computers and whatnot and David
[51:36] Letterman and the audience are pretty
[51:37] much making fun of him the whole time so
[51:40] Bill Gates brings up the fact of um that
[51:43] hey on the on the internet you can see a
[51:45] baseball game you can see something live
[51:48] or you can see it later on if you want
[51:50] to if you don't want to watch it right
[51:51] now and David Letterman's like uh have
[51:53] you ever heard of a radio we can already
[51:55] do that and then they start laughing at
[51:58] him and then he's like well on radio you
[52:01] can't do this you can you can replay it
[52:03] you can rewind it you can watch it later
[52:05] and then he's like uh you ever heard of
[52:07] a uh a tape recorder or a whatever right
[52:10] a vcr and then they start making fun of
[52:12] him so people don't understand new
[52:15] technologies and whose fault is that I
[52:17] would say that half of it it's the
[52:19] people's fault because they don't want
[52:20] to look into the new technology but it's
[52:22] going to be our fault too Robin if we
[52:24] don't explain to the world in an easier
[52:27] way of how to understand this thing
[52:29] because look at the end of the at the
[52:31] end of the day I don't think that it's
[52:34] us against everybody who's not
[52:35] bitcoiners right I think it's just that
[52:38] we all have to understand what it is
[52:40] right there's not going to be these two
[52:42] sides right now of bitcoiners and people
[52:44] who don't like bitcoiners like Peter
[52:45] Schiff well actually he's confusing me I
[52:47] don't even know if he's a bitcoiner he's
[52:48] really confusing me he might be the
[52:50] ultimate troll anyways but there's
[52:52] there's not going to be two sides
[52:53] there's just going to be everybody on
[52:55] bitcoin and we can only get there if you
[52:58] and I continue to do what we're doing
[53:00] you're spreading your word and I'm
[53:01] spreading my word too especially with my
[53:03] book coming out so we have to do our
[53:06] part so the main thing that's stopping
[53:08] us right now is education okay we need
[53:11] people to be educated so they don't just
[53:13] fall into the natural order of things
[53:15] which is her behavior that's natural
[53:17] order that's always going to happen
[53:18] there's only few leaders and then you
[53:20] have all the Sheep all right we have to
[53:23] educate them so they can make the moves
[53:25] for themselves do you think will will
[53:28] change uh in in society once Bitcoin is
[53:33] actually globally adopted I'm speaking
[53:35] like far out in the future where
[53:39] everyone gets Bitcoin and maybe Bitcoin
[53:41] is even like the world Reserve money
[53:43] currency asset whatever what is actually
[53:45] changing in in our behavior all right I
[53:49] would like to say that everything is
[53:51] going to change when it comes to our
[53:52] behaviors but I'll start by saying this
[53:55] that
[53:57] I I would think of this let's think of
[53:59] this in a mental health way all right I
[54:01] would say that most of the problems we
[54:05] have in life today people killing people
[54:07] people doing all these kind of bad
[54:08] things right is mostly because people
[54:11] are unhappy or they're not getting the
[54:14] actual functions that they want in life
[54:16] all right imagine a guy who worked 60
[54:17] years of his life working really really
[54:19] hard and he gets left with crumbs he
[54:22] gets nothing at the of course he's going
[54:24] to be mad this guy's pissed right this
[54:26] is more prone to do a lot more bad
[54:28] things than the average person okay now
[54:30] I'm not saying that that Sparks all of
[54:33] the problems in the world but when there
[54:36] is more people that when there are more
[54:38] people that are happy and they actually
[54:41] can save their time and energy they're
[54:44] able to create better things all right
[54:46] so if I have more money I'm allow I'm
[54:48] going to be able to make my ideas come
[54:50] to fruition and the same thing was going
[54:52] to happen with people people are going
[54:53] to promote different things and we're
[54:55] going to have better quality stuff right
[54:57] we're going to have better quality
[54:58] things because inflation's not occurring
[55:00] anymore we're not getting robbed anymore
[55:02] and people's best ideas can come to
[55:05] fruition right so I talk about this
[55:07] thing in my book Alexander Fleming right
[55:09] he is the guy who he's a scientist I
[55:12] believe is he Austrian oh no he's
[55:14] Scottish I'm sorry he's Scottish he's
[55:16] Scottish Alexander Fleming so he's
[55:19] Scottish and he discovered penicillin
[55:22] right and that saved millions of people
[55:25] to this day from back teral infections
[55:27] right now imagine Alexander Fleming if
[55:31] he couldn't go to medical school what if
[55:34] his life was so bad that he couldn't
[55:36] afford medical school he couldn't afford
[55:38] his next meal basically and he didn't
[55:42] get put into the place to where he can
[55:44] discover penicillin right do you see how
[55:46] bad that is for the whole world right
[55:48] now that no one can bring their ideas to
[55:51] fruition we're getting robbed of our
[55:52] ideas our time our energy and this is
[55:55] going to make our race worse in the end
[55:58] right so when I say I I hate to give you
[56:00] a general answer like that but I
[56:02] honestly think everything's going to be
[56:03] better because we're going to have much
[56:04] better technology we're going to have
[56:06] more advancements people are going to
[56:08] feel motivated to actually work because
[56:11] they're going to see the actual
[56:13] realization of all the functions that
[56:16] they actually want right but mostly I
[56:18] would like to say that we would probably
[56:20] see happier people we would see happier
[56:22] people and more quality things when it
[56:25] comes to manufact uring when it comes to
[56:27] our food when it comes to all of these
[56:29] things we're going to see um big changes
[56:33] in those areas because inflation is
[56:36] getting solved because that is the
[56:38] problem right is that not the root
[56:39] problem of all this stuff this is why
[56:41] Bitcoin is so important because of
[56:43] inflation if we could have just saved
[56:45] our dollars and it would have worked
[56:47] yeah it sucks but it would work and that
[56:49] would be the end of story right then we
[56:51] can live the good lives that we should
[56:53] be living but it doesn't work like that
[56:55] it never works works like that we need
[56:57] decentralization right and we can't
[56:58] trust people with our most valuable
[57:01] asset because humans are naturally
[57:04] selfish we're naturally selfish right
[57:06] we're always going to put ourselves
[57:08] first and that is a bad recipe for
[57:10] someone in charge of everybody else's
[57:12] time and energy all right so overall I
[57:15] see inflation going away with Bitcoin
[57:18] like way in the future like you're
[57:19] saying and that's going to bring the
[57:21] that's going to make the quality of Our
[57:23] Lives much better with our advancements
[57:25] technology
[57:26] Food and Health that was
[57:29] amazing random question but is this your
[57:32] first podcast yes this is my first
[57:34] podcast I'm honored that you are on my
[57:37] me with my first podcast because I think
[57:40] you will do a lot of podcast you're
[57:41] really fascinating guy and I could sit
[57:43] with you I think like 10 hours and ask
[57:44] you question about
[57:46] that you really you really know your
[57:48] stuff um and yeah I interview every day
[57:52] someone I I really like know when
[57:55] someone has potentially to be an amazing
[57:57] speaker and guest on podcast and I think
[58:00] you should reach out to all other
[58:01] podcast hosts also because you have a a
[58:04] great way of looking at it and I think a
[58:06] lot of people uh would benefit from that
[58:09] I was always the uh opinion that those
[58:12] podcasts are more here to entertain
[58:13] bitcoiners but I was recently at like
[58:16] some conferences and actually at every
[58:18] conference there's someone coming up to
[58:20] me and saying like hey I was not into
[58:22] Bitcoin when I first saw your podcast
[58:24] and now I'm into Bitcoin full so like
[58:26] those podcasts are actually important to
[58:28] Orange peill people uh so I think you
[58:31] you would do the the community service
[58:33] in being more on on other podcasts uh
[58:36] and and I hope to see that and I'm just
[58:37] feeling very honored that you you chose
[58:40] mine to be the first one yeah thank you
[58:41] so much thank you very much and thanks
[58:42] for giving me the opportunity for it too
[58:44] right because yeah even though you're
[58:46] the only person I reached out to right
[58:49] because like I said from way before when
[58:51] you were posting all those things every
[58:52] day and you used to you know back when
[58:54] you had the red banner stuff and you
[58:55] used used to be like hey I'm posting
[58:57] every single day look at my content and
[58:58] stuff yeah I was like yeah I want to be
[59:00] on this guy's podcast that's going to be
[59:01] awesome but let me focus on finishing my
[59:03] book in whatnot right so yeah thank you
[59:05] for for uh actually giving me
[59:07] opportunity for it yeah and I would love
[59:08] to be on more podcast and hopefully they
[59:10] hear that part that you said all the
[59:12] other podcasters so if you guys are
[59:14] listening please reach out to me I'd
[59:16] love to be on your show I really want to
[59:18] spread the message you can clip it out
[59:20] of the podcast and send it to
[59:25] everyone I'll do that but but yeah it's
[59:28] I think we are in contact since I think
[59:30] I saw May or something like that so
[59:32] since a since a longer time and right
[59:34] yeah it's it's been a crazy Journey also
[59:36] for the podcast I think I gained in that
[59:38] short period of like the eight n th000
[59:40] subscribers and a lot more listeners to
[59:42] that uh but yeah really really cool uh
[59:45] that that you're doing the book and I'm
[59:46] really excited to to seeing it more from
[59:48] you um now for for the end of the
[59:50] podcast I asked every single podcast
[59:53] guest one question and the question is
[59:55] what can we learn from from you besides
[59:57] Bitcoin and maybe besides the things
[59:59] that we already talked about today all
[60:01] right yeah I would say for me besides
[60:04] learning about a whole bunch of behavior
[60:05] stuff because that's what I'm going to
[60:06] be talking about naturally and Bitcoin
[60:08] or stuff two most important things uh
[60:10] about me right now but I think um
[60:13] something that you would learn from me I
[60:15] would say is uh purpose okay because I
[60:18] truly believe um purpose in life matters
[60:21] a lot especially um I don't mean to get
[60:23] all sentimental and whatnot but growing
[60:25] up as a um as a man in this in this day
[60:29] and age it's really difficult for a man
[60:31] a lot of people don't understand that
[60:32] they think that um you know it's it's it
[60:36] can't be any different than being a girl
[60:37] or whatnot right yeah I'll never
[60:39] understand what women's struggles are
[60:41] and I'm sure that they have a lot of
[60:42] struggles but it's very difficult for a
[60:43] man to grow up in a world where he
[60:48] believes that he's supposed to provide
[60:50] value he's supposed to protect his
[60:52] family he's supposed to do all these
[60:54] things for his family and and then
[60:56] there's this secret thing called
[60:58] inflation just messing it all up right
[61:01] and 99% of the world don't even know
[61:03] that so imagine 99% of the men in the
[61:06] world who are just like hey I hear about
[61:08] all these badass guys in history doing
[61:10] all these cool things and whatnot and I
[61:13] never going to be like them I'm never
[61:15] going to amount to what they amount to
[61:17] or what theyve done in their lives and
[61:19] I'm telling you that you are a man and
[61:22] you are just like the man like like all
[61:25] the men in
[61:26] history the thing is they had a purpose
[61:29] and they went for it right now we're
[61:32] growing up in a world where your purpose
[61:34] is being taken away from you you're
[61:35] becoming distracted and you're straying
[61:38] away from your purpose I want you to
[61:40] understand that you do have a purpose in
[61:42] life and you need to find that purpose
[61:44] and you need to understand why money is
[61:48] going to help you accomplish all your
[61:50] dreams okay and I don't mean that in a
[61:53] way of like hey money is evil and all
[61:54] these kind of things and you need to get
[61:56] money and you need to do everything for
[61:57] money no money is the economic or it is
[62:01] the economic representation of your
[62:04] energy and it is the it is the currency
[62:07] of the universe you need to understand
[62:09] that money has leverage okay and it is
[62:13] directly tied to your purpose in life
[62:16] okay those two things go hand inand and
[62:18] you need to understand that so I would
[62:19] say that um the most important thing
[62:21] that you can possibly learn from me is
[62:23] um your purpose in life because I really
[62:25] tied to behavior and how you can
[62:28] actually find out what your purpose is
[62:30] really really great Dylan thank you so
[62:32] much um we have an entertain in the
[62:34] podcast where the previous guest is
[62:36] asking a question for the next guest
[62:37] without knowing who the next guest
[62:38] actually is and I think that's uh very
[62:41] suiting question actually for you and
[62:43] I'm curious about what you say here has
[62:45] nothing to do with Bitcoin who is your
[62:48] biggest hero and if you don't have a
[62:50] hero who do you respect the most ah my
[62:53] biggest hero oh yeah that's a little
[62:56] difficult on the spot all right I would
[62:58] say that I have a bunch of different
[63:00] heroes in different aspects of my life
[63:02] because I can't say someone who's taught
[63:04] me a lot about money is my biggest hero
[63:06] when it comes to me playing Call of Duty
[63:08] right so very different things right but
[63:11] I would say honestly my um my biggest
[63:14] hero is my dad because um I don't mean
[63:18] to give a cliche answer but um you know
[63:22] my dad has a really good way of showing
[63:24] you that he loves you and he always
[63:27] backs you without actually saying much
[63:30] if that if that makes much sense right
[63:32] um so I would throughout my whole life I
[63:35] would always bring up any kind of topic
[63:36] to my dad or if I was ever in trouble or
[63:38] anything like that if I bring it up to
[63:40] him he would um ensure that I will be
[63:44] okay with his exact opposite Persona
[63:48] than me right I'm the exact opposite of
[63:51] my dad I worry a lot I talk a lot I'm
[63:53] sure you know that already but um he's
[63:56] the exact opposite and I think it really
[63:57] brings balance to my character and um it
[64:00] makes me really think that everything is
[64:02] going to be all right absolutely I I
[64:05] love that uh the connection between a
[64:07] father and the Sun is something special
[64:10] uh in inia really cool uh thank you so
