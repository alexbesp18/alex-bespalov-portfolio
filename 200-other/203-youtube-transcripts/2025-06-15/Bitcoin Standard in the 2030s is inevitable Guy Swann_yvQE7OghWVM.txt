[00:00] we're here like right when this is
[00:02] really starting I don't see how we don't
[00:03] make it through the 2030s without a
[00:05] Bitcoin standard the internet without
[00:07] Bitcoin is actually going to centralize
[00:10] and move into a direction that makes the
[00:11] internet a negative in a lot of
[00:13] different way the interest rate price
[00:14] controls and the Fiat system don't work
[00:17] if people have an escape Bitcoin is
[00:18] small enough that it like moves like
[00:20] crazy and dollar is so huge that it's
[00:22] just like really hard to see anything
[00:24] but as they get closer and you start to
[00:25] see little movements you just shift
[00:28] eventually one's only going down and
[00:30] one's only going up on a long enough
[00:32] timeline in seven years it'll be a very
[00:33] very interesting conversation seven
[00:35] years we may be looking back and
[00:36] thinking like oh yeah this is we're
[00:38] already we're already past that point
[00:40] where that market can't operate as if
[00:42] Bitcoin doesn't
[00:43] exist I want to start the day with what
[00:46] do you think is the most widely
[00:48] misunderstood aspect in Bitcoin when you
[00:51] talk on the one hand with bitcoiners but
[00:53] also on the other hand with normies that
[00:56] are not in Bitcoin and what should like
[00:58] what should be the topic that I should
[01:00] feature in almost every podcast episode
[01:03] to educate people
[01:05] on so the biggest disconnect without
[01:07] question and it's funny because like
[01:10] I've been wasting time on X this on
[01:12] Twitter this morning and uh um and it's
[01:16] it's with the finance guy or whatever
[01:19] who's having the exact same the the the
[01:22] mental frame the the picture that he has
[01:24] for what Bitcoin is is just so it's so
[01:28] payments app
[01:30] you know it's like it's just like this
[01:32] is it's a it's a
[01:34] monetary asset and I actually got him to
[01:38] recognize that most people still don't
[01:40] trust Bitcoin don't understand what it
[01:42] is and have no conception that it's like
[01:45] a reliable place to store value and I'm
[01:46] like yes yes yes trust trust trust the
[01:51] trust Market the cycle of adoption of
[01:54] trust as a monetary good is still
[01:57] incredibly nent and you know when when
[02:00] you look at Monetary history and you're
[02:03] trying to compare it to stuff like he's
[02:05] comparing it to which this is an analogy
[02:08] that I this is an analogy that I use
[02:11] quite a bit is tcpip because it is also
[02:13] a protocol and protocols have their own
[02:16] difficulties in network adoption but
[02:18] it's a protocol and the money and from
[02:21] the context of a
[02:23] money he's thinking of it like a
[02:25] payments app like oh well cash app was
[02:27] popular after like three years you know
[02:29] why can I use it at Costco I'm like
[02:32] every other monetary a good a good in
[02:36] the market a new monetary good that has
[02:38] been monetized literally it's like an
[02:41] average of a century like Bitcoin is
[02:44] being monetized faster than any other
[02:47] monetary good the trust network is
[02:49] growing and providing a positive
[02:51] feedback for Bitcoin faster than any
[02:54] other money in history it is succeeding
[02:59] wildly and his like I can't use it at
[03:01] Costco yet and it's been 15 years is
[03:04] like I get that you see apps you see
[03:07] apps you see the internet you see these
[03:10] technological things that have been
[03:12] adopted you've never seen a trust
[03:15] Network be adopted you've never seen an
[03:18] asset be monetized from zero because if
[03:22] you and and I'm trying right now
[03:24] actually last the last thing I said to
[03:26] him was what's the most recent thing
[03:28] that you can think of that was a good
[03:30] that was monetized what's the most
[03:32] recent one what was it like how long did
[03:34] it take like what were the
[03:36] characteristics um and and that's like a
[03:39] huge disconnect all the all the normies
[03:41] that I talk to they they think in apps
[03:44] they think in websites they think and
[03:48] platforms it's just like they don't
[03:51] realize that there's genuinely
[03:54] nothing nothing in their span of 20
[03:57] years of existence or 30 years whatever
[03:59] it is is that actually relates to
[04:02] bitcoin they can really apply it to you
[04:04] can get a general understanding of how
[04:07] difficulty the net how difficult the
[04:08] network effect and how the technology
[04:11] stack is going to unfold because you can
[04:13] look at Bitcoin like a protocol and we
[04:15] have the internet to compare it to it
[04:17] Bitcoin is a fundamental protocol as as
[04:20] core to our communication layers in fact
[04:23] arguably below it even though it you
[04:25] kind of need the Internet for Bitcoin to
[04:27] work you technically don't like it's the
[04:30] the trust layer actually becomes it's
[04:31] weird because the you know the internet
[04:34] layer is right here you've got like the
[04:36] foundation of society you've got like
[04:37] culture language Pol like like uh the
[04:40] societal rules and property rights and
[04:42] the political system and then you've got
[04:44] communication layers right you obviously
[04:46] you can't have a communication layer
[04:47] until you have language um so
[04:49] communication layers are above it and
[04:51] then because of this communication layer
[04:52] we are able to create a new monetary
[04:55] protocol except that that new monetary
[04:57] protocol is actually down here
[05:00] it's just it can only exist because of
[05:02] the technology of the communication
[05:03] layer um so it's it's interesting to
[05:06] think about it that we're building a
[05:08] lower layer on with all of the tools of
[05:10] a higher layer uh uh and but like that
[05:14] that framing so we can kind of
[05:16] understand the evolution of the
[05:17] technology stack because it is a
[05:19] protocol and we've we've actually have a
[05:22] a very Prime and recent example of
[05:24] watching a protocol stack come into
[05:26] being which most people still don't know
[05:28] much concrete about the history of
[05:30] the internet they just kind of Google it
[05:32] like um but there's a fascinating and
[05:35] kind of Rich history to unpack there
[05:37] which I've done in a bunch of different
[05:38] episodes on the show um but uh but yeah
[05:42] 100% 100% it's that bitcoin's first
[05:46] Network effect and adoption cycle is
[05:49] going to be very long it's going to be
[05:51] very slow and it's about trust it is
[05:54] about trust it's not about payments it's
[05:57] not about buying stuff with it at Costco
[05:59] it's about establishing its trust in the
[06:03] face of you know 200 some odd monetary
[06:07] competitors uh and who also maintain a
[06:10] violent Monopoly over the money market
[06:13] can it continue to exist and can it
[06:15] continue to be a money in those markets
[06:20] despite a violent Monopoly preventing it
[06:23] that's what bitcoin's job is right now
[06:25] so that's amazing and I think um the
[06:30] comparison with this dcpip protocol is
[06:32] so crucial because people don't get that
[06:35] uh they always trying to compare
[06:37] MasterCard PayPal and everything with
[06:40] Bitcoin but this are layer three four
[06:42] five technology and not layer one
[06:44] technology and once you study and I
[06:47] study it and and computer science in in
[06:50] school like when I I was like 15 16
[06:53] years old from that onwards moment and I
[06:56] know the tcpi pro protocols and still it
[06:59] was for me a big hurdle to go over
[07:00] through that um but for me it's like
[07:03] with with Bitcoin you have the
[07:05] possibility to invest in the tcpi Pro P
[07:07] protocol this is something mindblowing
[07:09] like imagine like don't don't having to
[07:12] care what application on there will
[07:14] succeed because with tpip you had to
[07:17] like oh will Facebook succeed with
[07:19] Myspace succeed will Amazon succeed and
[07:23] you had to invest in there to gain from
[07:25] that with Bitcoin you can invest in the
[07:27] base layer like in the tcpip
[07:30] tokens if you want to do that uh which
[07:33] which also leads me kind of to the to
[07:34] the next topic uh do you think and we
[07:38] talked about a little bit do you think
[07:39] the internet or Bitcoin is then the
[07:42] bigger Revolution because we could argue
[07:44] that Bitcoin is kind of in the internet
[07:47] Revolution and it's the monetary aspect
[07:50] of the internet but it's also its own
[07:52] thing where you can build on top of
[07:56] that
[07:57] um it's interesting
[08:00] because Bitcoin as a
[08:03] protocol technically can work on pen and
[08:07] paper um it could actually be it
[08:10] certainly wouldn't be very
[08:12] efficient um and it wouldn't provide
[08:16] like it's security mechanism would be
[08:18] very difficult because you need a kind
[08:20] of broadcast layer for the protocol to
[08:23] actually work but it could be done uh
[08:27] you could in a really funny way you
[08:29] could do it in a very slow High
[08:31] settlement system over snail mail you
[08:34] could do it over radio so it's not
[08:37] technically
[08:38] necessary that you need the Internet for
[08:41] it but it's never really going to
[08:44] operate without the internet because of
[08:46] the complexity of the design um and uh
[08:50] so it's it's not practical without the
[08:52] internet is probably the better way to
[08:53] put it uh so from the context of which
[08:59] is is the more
[09:02] revolutionary uh invention so to speak
[09:06] is it's a question
[09:09] of which one will have the most Impact
[09:12] versus which one is interdependent on
[09:14] the other like they they are
[09:15] interdependent on each other like the
[09:17] internet without Bitcoin is actually
[09:21] going to centralize and move into a
[09:23] direction that makes the internet uh a
[09:25] negative in a lot of different ways and
[09:28] Bitcoin without the internet can't quite
[09:31] can't really work they like the internet
[09:33] is kind of the establishment of the
[09:34] ecosystem and the Bitcoin is and Bitcoin
[09:37] is the protocol that will create the
[09:40] rules and the incentives for that
[09:42] ecosystem so the ecosystem alone is
[09:46] going would lead to these giant
[09:48] centralized platforms and all of these
[09:50] things without a monetary a base
[09:51] monetary protocol in it um which which
[09:55] is why the internet was such a profound
[09:58] invent from the context of communication
[10:01] and opening the communication layers of
[10:03] the world uh but then Bitcoin I think is
[10:06] actually going to reinvent the internet
[10:08] so Bitcoin Bitcoin is at a lowest level
[10:13] from a from a fundamental conse a
[10:16] consequential layer in society it it
[10:21] establishes rules uh the limits of
[10:24] political control it establishes the
[10:28] cost and ability to exit abusive and
[10:32] violent monopolies and jurisdictions and
[10:35] all of these things and uh you know if
[10:37] you read like something like Nick Zabo
[10:39] has a great piece on this called exit
[10:41] and freedom is that largely
[10:44] the the very means by which freedom is
[10:47] established has nothing to do with
[10:49] getting a political system that is nice
[10:51] or is like really good it's about
[10:53] lowering the barrier to exit because if
[10:56] you can exit your value from an
[10:59] intrusive political system uh or an
[11:02] abusive or tyrannical uh political
[11:04] system well then you can defund that
[11:06] political system very quickly because
[11:08] the whole basis of it is to steal value
[11:10] that you didn't that it doesn't have uh
[11:12] that it didn't earn or it doesn't create
[11:15] um uh you know if you read something
[11:16] like
[11:17] U uh the sovereign individual um uh I
[11:22] think they have a brilliant thesis that
[11:24] the the better way to understand history
[11:28] is through a technological lens on the
[11:31] economics of violence is what does it
[11:34] cost to steal something from someone and
[11:37] uh what is the what's the degree of the
[11:40] feedback mechanism this is why the most
[11:42] important things in his in history for
[11:44] establishing the way Society works today
[11:46] have been agriculture gunpowder printing
[11:49] press internet like all of these things
[11:52] um and uh like for instance the state
[11:55] didn't exist before agriculture it's
[11:58] very if you think about it through the
[11:59] context of the economics of violence is
[12:01] a very simple reason why is because if
[12:03] we're hunter gatherers and we just carry
[12:05] all our value on our back and you know
[12:09] there's it's just like kind of free
[12:10] flowing Society you can move from one
[12:12] area to another no Mafia can like you're
[12:16] not going to stay a slave you're not
[12:18] gonna you're not going to be you know
[12:20] beholden to some sort of Mafia that
[12:21] takes half of what you earn and half of
[12:24] what you value you're just going to
[12:26] throw it all in your back and you're
[12:27] going to leave so the e iics of violence
[12:29] the ability to exit because you can
[12:31] carry all of your value with you is very
[12:34] very low and thus there's essentially
[12:36] freedom because abuse can't does not
[12:40] have this positive or I guess
[12:41] technically this negative feedback loop
[12:44] where the stronger they get the easier
[12:46] it is for their for them to enforce
[12:47] their control and
[12:49] Authority whereas when agriculture comes
[12:52] along now 98% of our value is trapped
[12:57] stuck right there on the land I've built
[12:59] a house I have oxen I have a harvest
[13:02] that's not even going to come until next
[13:04] year I I have to be here if if I pick up
[13:07] and leave my cost of exit is now 98% of
[13:10] my value so when the mafia comes with
[13:13] sticks and you know they put a knife to
[13:16] my wife's throat and they say you're G
[13:17] to give me half of what you earn that's
[13:20] the lower cost I give them half of what
[13:23] I earn because otherwise I lose 98% to
[13:26] leave with my family now sometimes the
[13:29] cost does get that high sometimes you
[13:30] don't want to live as a slave and
[13:32] sometimes you do leave but you leave 98%
[13:34] of your value for the mafia so they
[13:37] don't care and uh so in thinking about
[13:41] the rules how how this economics of
[13:45] violence
[13:46] establishes uh the limitations of
[13:48] tyranny in a society Bitcoin literally
[13:51] shifts the entire Dynamic practically
[13:54] back to the hunter gatherer days now I
[13:57] can just I can sell into that system I
[14:00] can I can sell into that market for an
[14:03] asset that I can hold in my mind I can I
[14:07] can have it in my brain and I can walk
[14:10] to any other jurisdiction I can leave to
[14:12] anywhere in the world and the cost of
[14:14] exit has Dr drastically drastically
[14:18] plummeted um because we have a
[14:21] essentially a system of property rights
[14:24] without a
[14:26] state we have a system of in and
[14:30] exchanging value without the need for
[14:33] any sort of state
[14:35] enforcement and in fact that works in
[14:37] spite of state enforcement in spite of
[14:41] tyrannical controls Capital controls and
[14:43] all of these things um and I think the
[14:46] people
[14:47] who I think don't understand the degree
[14:51] of effect the economics of violence has
[14:55] in the structure of the world today it's
[14:58] very easy for them to misplace or or
[15:04] miscalculate how unbelievably
[15:07] profound the effect of making not even a
[15:11] significant shift a small shift in the
[15:14] economics of violence changes the world
[15:17] Bitcoin is a big shift in the economics
[15:20] of violence comparably like we don't
[15:22] really have a lot of good examples I
[15:24] think on something that has changed it
[15:26] so drastically in such a short period of
[15:28] time
[15:29] um and it will continue to take time
[15:33] to realize this in practice uh but
[15:40] um I I
[15:42] think it it very much depends on how you
[15:45] treat the interdependent relationship
[15:47] but I think Bitcoin is by far the more
[15:49] fundamental protocol and it
[15:52] changes it has a more fundamental change
[15:54] to how we will Design or how we will
[15:56] organize as a species that's uh just an
[16:00] amazing speech that you just gave
[16:02] wow thank you for that um and I think uh
[16:06] technology in itself is so interesting
[16:08] and I mentioned before the the the
[16:10] podcast also you did with um uh Preston
[16:14] uh about Ai and I think a lot about how
[16:18] AI will play a bigger and bigger role
[16:20] because I use it myself more and more
[16:23] and I see it every day how it gets more
[16:27] intelligent how it gets better and
[16:28] better integrated and how it grasps more
[16:31] and more data from from all over uh and
[16:34] you gave so many great examples in the
[16:36] podcast um do you see um like first of
[16:39] all before we go to the dangers of of AI
[16:43] um what what role do you think or will
[16:46] AI play a role uh in the Bitcoin
[16:48] adoption and and obvious question also
[16:51] to ask Will AI choose Bitcoin as the the
[16:54] main store of
[16:56] value um uh
[16:59] 100% um I honestly think AI will
[17:02] largely it you won't be able to
[17:04] disconnect AI from pretty much anything
[17:07] um AI is in fact this is like God one of
[17:11] the craziest things to think about like
[17:13] where we are
[17:14] today is how
[17:17] many you know the overwhelming amount of
[17:20] innovation and like new technology that
[17:23] you have in a world or or in a market
[17:27] over time the over whelming majority is
[17:31] kind of I forget there's like a specific
[17:33] term for it it's like maintaining
[17:36] technology um uh it's it's Innovation
[17:38] that occurs within the systems that we
[17:41] have like like rather than changing the
[17:45] Piston the Piston uh you know uh uh
[17:49] intake exhaust uh uh oh Jesus Christ
[17:54] what's the word whatever the piston
[17:56] engine the internal combustion ra rather
[17:58] than changing the fun Al design of the
[18:00] internal combustion engine I'm missing
[18:01] I'm brain farting on one piece of it um
[18:04] uh you make the gears a little bit
[18:08] stronger or you space them out in a new
[18:11] way to get it slightly more efficient or
[18:14] you you know put in a turbo on the
[18:16] intake so you can put in more pressure
[18:19] or you do electronic valves instead of
[18:22] um uh instead of a manual valve uh and
[18:25] you can you know you can microcontrol
[18:27] the amount of release or like input on
[18:30] the pressure and you can get more
[18:32] efficient with a computer like you you
[18:34] change little things around the design
[18:37] but you uh uh but you don't change the
[18:41] system one of the fascinating things
[18:43] about where we are today is how many
[18:45] systems disruptions we are witnessing at
[18:50] the same time AI is one of those things
[18:54] uh AI is kind of like a way to Model A
[18:58] series or a set of
[19:00] patterns um at a large scale I I I like
[19:04] to think about it as uh I think this is
[19:07] a a decent analogy at least a picture
[19:09] it's not totally accurate but I've
[19:11] actually since since I thought about
[19:14] this from uh one of the pieces that
[19:16] broke down that I covered on the show on
[19:18] AI Unchained um uh for how an llm works
[19:22] and how the encoding decoding and all of
[19:24] this stuff works is it immediately
[19:26] painted a picture in my mind of like
[19:28] this is actually a giant compression
[19:30] algorithm for relationships between
[19:34] words for for patterns in language and
[19:38] so that you could think of it as an
[19:40] insanely lossy compression so that I I
[19:43] can compress a bunch of Articles or a
[19:45] bunch of pictures or or something and
[19:48] rather than storing the the actual image
[19:51] data and rather than storing all the
[19:53] individual pixels which I could do
[19:56] before and I can do on a hard drive but
[19:58] that takes up an enormous amount of
[19:59] space instead what I've done is I have
[20:03] compressed the
[20:05] relationship between these pixels over
[20:07] here and these pixels over here and
[20:10] connected to to Connected them to the
[20:12] idea of a cat and
[20:15] so later on I am able to quote unquote
[20:20] redraw a cat I'm able to exchange the
[20:25] specificity of the data for computation
[20:28] and I am able to compute back out of it
[20:31] the pattern of a
[20:33] cat even though it's not actually a
[20:35] picture of any one particular cat but
[20:38] there is always some set of
[20:40] relationships between the pixels that a
[20:43] cat basically represents our eyes see it
[20:45] our minds see it all the time right I
[20:48] can see that there is a pattern that
[20:49] makes a cat and if it looks more like a
[20:52] dog well I'm I recognize that there's a
[20:54] dog the brain is a model creation tool
[20:58] that's a lot of reason that I think
[21:00] people have misunderstandings about
[21:02] where AI is AI all of these different
[21:04] AIS are explicit models about explicit
[21:08] sets of patterns while the human brain
[21:10] is a generalized model creation tool we
[21:14] create new models about all sorts of
[21:16] things all the time we're a giant like
[21:20] broad generalized
[21:22] multimodality model creation tool so
[21:25] we're more like the computer the P torch
[21:28] um and the the software set and the
[21:31] model because we have thousands of
[21:33] models about all sorts of different
[21:34] things you know I I have models about
[21:36] how Maps work I have models about
[21:37] physical location you developed you
[21:40] developed thousands of models about
[21:41] reality before you even can speak you
[21:44] know language isn't the entirety of how
[21:47] we relate to the world like I already
[21:49] know not to go jump off a cliff before
[21:52] I'm making full sentences you know
[21:54] because I fell down and I hurt myself
[21:55] and I bumped my knee uh so I got have
[21:59] many models of reality um and uh AI
[22:04] is is going to
[22:07] be one of the most efficient and
[22:09] adaptive ways at which we've
[22:13] ever stored in recalled patterns um like
[22:17] we're going to be able to basically
[22:19] anything it's kind of like the assembly
[22:21] line you know allowed us to take the um
[22:26] meticulous process of you know
[22:29] handcrafting all of these things and
[22:31] kind of automated it by recognizing the
[22:35] pattern in that in the series of events
[22:38] and then you know creating some concrete
[22:40] thing at each piece that Stamped Out
[22:44] ubiquitous um or you know equal pieces
[22:48] at each at each stage of it and so now
[22:50] like only one piece needs to actually be
[22:52] done well this is kind of like that same
[22:55] sort of abstraction for tasks for
[22:59] patterns in language for uh for image
[23:03] generation and video generation patterns
[23:06] uh and because of that we basically are
[23:10] yet another step removed from the
[23:13] creation process and now we're going to
[23:15] organize and understand the
[23:17] relationships between patterns that's
[23:19] where we're going to be useful because
[23:20] again we're a big General
[23:22] multimodality model creation tool so
[23:24] we're now going to use all of these
[23:26] individual models just like I use my
[23:29] model of physics and my model of you
[23:32] know light and like all of the different
[23:34] things all the models that I have in my
[23:35] relationship with the world I use a
[23:37] combination of hundreds of these models
[23:39] to go build a tool you know build some
[23:42] sort of a project or put my minor up in
[23:44] my my attic I'm I'm constantly referring
[23:46] to tons of different models in my mind
[23:48] but the combination of all those all
[23:50] those things lets me accomplish a task
[23:53] well we're going to be doing the same
[23:54] thing with ai ai is going to be kind of
[23:56] an interaction layer um like already
[23:59] this is why I started the the um series
[24:01] called uh devs who can't code and AI is
[24:05] going to be fascinatingly good at
[24:08] writing code uh because code is a code
[24:12] is a language and specifically it is a
[24:15] language without ambiguity so while it's
[24:19] actually going to be a little bit
[24:20] difficult at poetry or metaphors or
[24:23] analogies because it's really abstract
[24:25] language is an extremely artistic uh
[24:28] form of communication and people don't
[24:30] really appreciate that um uh and so
[24:34] language is actually it's going to sound
[24:36] like a term paper every time it writes
[24:38] and if you if you you know give it
[24:40] something and you ask it to write you
[24:41] something it's almost always going to be
[24:42] on the nose one of the things that I do
[24:44] with my um a couple AI tools that I use
[24:47] regularly for the podcast is I have uh a
[24:49] little script that I built with chbt so
[24:52] so I have a little app that I've built
[24:54] um and uh uh what it does is when I'm
[24:58] done with any sort of a show like if I
[24:59] was you know we're recording this is as
[25:01] soon as I was done I would export the
[25:04] video file and then I drop that on my
[25:06] transcribe app and it's going to write
[25:08] it's going to print out an entire text
[25:10] file with the entire
[25:12] conversation and then I take that text
[25:14] file and I put it into an llm and I say
[25:17] can you write me a short description can
[25:19] you frame it as a question uh that will
[25:22] you know lead the the audience's Mind
[25:26] toward the content of the show and I've
[25:30] never actually used exactly what it gave
[25:32] me but it always has a really good
[25:34] starting point because it will read the
[25:35] context and it will understand what the
[25:37] conversation was about but it almost
[25:39] always asks an on the- noose question so
[25:43] like uh uh and whereas typically I want
[25:47] to ask one step removed so like a good
[25:50] one was um uh what was the episode about
[25:54] um why there was so much antagonism like
[25:56] the bitter bitter ant agism toward
[25:59] Bitcoin from policy makers like why does
[26:02] Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren like
[26:03] literally like hate it like why does she
[26:05] hate it why does Gary guinsler just like
[26:08] have like have to make sure that Bitcoin
[26:10] ETFs don't get approved and it basically
[26:13] wouldn't have happened without a uh
[26:15] without the court forcing their hand
[26:18] well it's because Bitcoin allows pure
[26:20] price signals and the reason the Fiat
[26:22] system works the reason interest rate
[26:24] price controls work is because there's
[26:26] no exit valve there's not an escape you
[26:30] know um uh Christine lagard said this
[26:34] explicitly and Allan Greenspan wrote
[26:36] about it in a paper um back in the 60s
[26:40] or 70s or something um he talked about
[26:42] like the the reason statists have such a
[26:45] profound antagonism like a hysterical
[26:48] antagonism toward the gold standard and
[26:50] they come up as much propaganda against
[26:52] it as possible is specifically
[26:55] because the the interest rate price
[26:57] controls and the Fiat system don't work
[27:00] if people have an escape it becomes the
[27:04] alternative price signal that it's
[27:06] essentially the canary and the coalmine
[27:08] for the financial system so that's why
[27:10] they had to put a cap on it they they
[27:13] had to Outlaw ownersh you know
[27:15] individual ownership of gold um they had
[27:18] to suppress the ETFs and luckily gold is
[27:22] well luckily for them unluckily for us
[27:25] gold is such an insanely slow and
[27:27] impossible at SC fail to settle um like
[27:30] you can't you just can't settle hundred
[27:31] billion of gold right like France
[27:33] couldn't even do it when they tried they
[27:35] tried once over the period of 40 years
[27:38] and the US said no you know back in the
[27:40] back in the 70s so the ability to at
[27:43] scale force their hand on on kind of
[27:46] revealing the true price it's just not
[27:49] possible Bitcoin can move a hundred
[27:51] billion dollars in a second for for two
[27:53] bucks transaction fee Bitcoin can at
[27:57] scale move volume of value like nothing
[28:00] ever in history and it can do it to any
[28:03] corner of the world instantly and that's
[28:05] one thing that people don't realiz is
[28:06] that even when transaction fees are $
[28:08] thousand doll it's still going to cause
[28:13] like on the Bas layer it is still going
[28:15] to be such an astronomical price signal
[28:19] like you'll be able to move a trillion
[28:20] dollars out of a country in 10
[28:22] minutes like you're talking about
[28:24] killing the the survival of a country
[28:27] the capital in country being able to
[28:29] move
[28:31] intraday
[28:32] intraday like that's insane to think
[28:35] about and even better is the more
[28:37] capital is moving cheaper it is to do
[28:41] like what's it like a
[28:43] 0.001% fee at a thousand transaction fee
[28:47] to move a trillion bucks you know um so
[28:52] uh at scale Bitcoin becomes especially
[28:55] if it's available to retail especially
[28:57] if it has broad
[28:58] Global multi-layered networks you have
[29:00] the lightning Network you have retail in
[29:03] ETFs um you have normal day-to-day users
[29:07] you have countries like El Salvador
[29:08] adopting it it becomes this alarm Bell
[29:13] for every single time a bad policy
[29:15] decision is made and as Christine lagard
[29:18] said that our policies they're their
[29:22] nerp policies you know negative interest
[29:25] rates their their attempts to control
[29:27] and choke the uh the debt markets of the
[29:31] world Capital controls only work price
[29:34] controls only work if you control the
[29:36] entire
[29:37] Market if you have 20% of the market
[29:40] that you can't touch that 20% is going
[29:42] to reveal
[29:44] instantaneously how stupid your policy
[29:46] is and all of your prices are false
[29:49] black Market's going to have 300% of the
[29:51] price that your little price controls
[29:52] are and black market is the only place
[29:54] that people are going to be able to get
[29:55] those products or services or whatever
[29:57] it is that you're trying to into price
[29:58] control price controls don't work unless
[30:00] you have a totality over the market the
[30:03] antagonism toward
[30:04] Bitcoin is specifically because it is an
[30:07] escape
[30:08] valve as Christine lagard says if there
[30:11] is an escape people will use it and it
[30:14] won't work therefore they cannot allow
[30:16] an escape that is where that Hy
[30:18] hysterical antagonism comes from that
[30:20] was a really really long tangent to say
[30:22] going back to the AI thing is that it
[30:25] it's when I ask when I get it to ask a
[30:27] question about that it doesn't give me a
[30:29] question that leads to it it gives me a
[30:32] question that's like super on the nose
[30:34] like is is uh you know Bitcoin a an
[30:38] alarm Bell for a financial policy and
[30:41] you know is it a canary in the coal mine
[30:44] for the financial like it uses like
[30:46] something explicit from the conversation
[30:48] and then it just gives a bunch of
[30:49] details rather than what's the what's
[30:53] the source of this deep antagonism to
[30:55] bitcoin from policy makers does it does
[30:58] it shake the foundations of what they
[31:00] are able to accomplish and how you know
[31:02] that's that's the more that's the
[31:04] removed question that I would be going
[31:05] for um but uh anyway holy crap that was
[31:09] a that was a long tangent for just kind
[31:11] of saying that uh I think AI is going to
[31:14] be our interface for accomplishing
[31:15] things um uh much like uh we now think
[31:19] of the keyboard and the mouse as this is
[31:22] how we interact with computers this is
[31:24] how we you know you can say that
[31:27] photoshop killed art but did it of
[31:31] course not you just have Photoshop art
[31:35] you know you still draw on Photoshop
[31:38] what we're looking at is the base layer
[31:40] of these tools and it's a new layer it's
[31:42] a new interface it's far more akin to
[31:45] touch interface it's far more akin to
[31:47] the um the keyboard and mouse I think
[31:50] than it is
[31:52] um you know a production like a like a
[31:56] film editing software or something
[31:57] something like that like you'll still
[31:59] use it within film editing I guess is
[32:01] probably the way to think about it um
[32:04] but uh a decent example is my brother
[32:07] was trying to make a a funny meme the
[32:08] other day and and he asked me for my
[32:11] help because I I know how to use all
[32:12] these tools and he was just trying to
[32:14] use the stable Cascade demo and it
[32:15] wasn't working uh and we ended up doing
[32:18] like 20 different things and like trying
[32:21] a bunch of stuff and we just could not
[32:22] get the picture to look like he
[32:24] described it you know it was just a a
[32:26] stupid Meme and uh and he ended up going
[32:29] back with like the very original Meme
[32:30] and just putting like basic text over it
[32:32] but uh it's a good example of like you
[32:34] can't just go say like generate this
[32:37] image that I have in my head and then it
[32:38] just pops out like it's very explicit
[32:41] tools for very for very concrete sorts
[32:44] of patterns and if you don't know how to
[32:46] composite you know if you don't if you
[32:49] don't know how to like blend if you
[32:51] don't have a vision in your mind well
[32:53] then you're just going to kind of create
[32:54] the generic image diffusion that the
[32:58] image generator is going to create um
[33:00] and people are going to get bored with
[33:02] that F they already have they
[33:04] already have uh like AI image generation
[33:08] like the stock image generation is
[33:10] already just kind of like scroll past it
[33:12] you know like it's not it it doesn't
[33:14] pull the um interest that it once did
[33:17] because it's already kind of flooded all
[33:19] over the place um but yeah anyway that's
[33:22] the the way I think about it is that AI
[33:24] is going to be a an interaction layer
[33:27] it's going to be a UI for how we do
[33:30] things um especially especially right
[33:34] code um uh I mean I've I've just been
[33:37] building constantly like just these
[33:39] little Pro whenever I have the time to
[33:41] just sit down and you know throw 40
[33:43] minutes and hour at a project um I can
[33:46] just make all sorts of little micro apps
[33:48] and it's getting increasingly complex
[33:51] like what you can do with it which is
[33:52] really exciting um and uh uh and more
[33:58] importantly going back to the other part
[34:00] of your question about
[34:02] Bitcoin
[34:04] is I think one of the things about AI is
[34:09] that like I said in the compression
[34:12] analogy is that you're trading
[34:14] computation for data you're you're
[34:18] storing the pattern of a thing at like
[34:21] you know
[34:22] 1% of storing the actual thing and you
[34:26] can't fully take that that same exact
[34:28] picture back out of it but you can
[34:30] restore the pattern of the astronaut or
[34:34] the
[34:35] cat and because of that there's an
[34:39] enormous amount of computation involved
[34:41] and computation you can think of as a
[34:43] proof of work it is a irreversible final
[34:49] payment and when you have that
[34:51] computation as the basis for your
[34:53] interaction imagine if it cost you a p
[34:58] every time you moved the
[35:00] mouse like it would be
[35:04] insanely difficult to
[35:07] price and deal with the cost of you know
[35:11] letting somebody use your API to a
[35:14] website if you were just pulling in a
[35:17] penny a penny a penny a penny a penny a
[35:19] penny a penny a penny like just all over
[35:21] the place every single time somebody
[35:23] does any interaction it's costing you a
[35:25] penny because you just have an enormous
[35:28] amount of computation with every single
[35:29] thing that's occurring well with AI you
[35:33] re you literally have this they're are
[35:35] they're running into bottlenecks
[35:36] everywhere because this is It's
[35:38] exploding so fast in fact I read an
[35:40] article the other day and I'm this is
[35:43] something that I'm been trying to dig
[35:44] into a little bit more but it's very
[35:47] possible that we may have a Resurgence
[35:49] of uh nuclear power support and
[35:52] proponents because Google Apple Nvidia
[35:56] and all of these companies are running
[35:58] out of power like they're using so much
[36:01] computation that they're desperate for a
[36:03] ro like a huge dense energy source and
[36:07] so they're like well we've got nuclear
[36:10] they don't they don't care they don't
[36:11] care about the politics anymore they
[36:13] care about a solution and there's not a
[36:15] direct solution so they're actually
[36:17] looking at kind of rebuilding this
[36:20] support for nuclear which is great
[36:22] because nuclear should have been the
[36:23] thing we should have been going through
[36:24] thorium reactors this whole time it
[36:25] would have solved a whole lot of if
[36:27] the government had had gone the thorium
[36:29] route rather than the uranium route but
[36:31] the governments wanted bombs they didn't
[36:33] want energy so uh we went uranium and
[36:36] plutonium uh but uh uh so it will be
[36:40] fascinating to watch that Resurgence
[36:42] occur just because the demand of energy
[36:45] now outpaces what we can actually
[36:46] produce because of the Staggering amount
[36:48] of computation but when you have an
[36:50] irreversible proof of work as a
[36:54] service well how do you accept payment
[36:57] on a
[36:59] non-settling credit-based identity-based
[37:03] payment system that can be that you know
[37:07] has billions of dollars of fraud growing
[37:10] every year like it gets worse and worse
[37:14] because the ability to mimic other
[37:16] people and the ability to steal their
[37:19] the ease and low cost of stealing their
[37:21] information like you can get a credit
[37:23] card um credit card details Social
[37:26] Security uh address and everything for a
[37:30] a person I think it's like $5 a pop
[37:32] typically on the dark web you just
[37:36] eviscerate somebody's life it's so
[37:38] prevalent like it's so out there that
[37:40] basically all of our information is
[37:42] exposed it's simply that there's not
[37:44] enough people you can't exploit it at
[37:46] scale so literally the only reason we
[37:49] don't all get hit with identity theft
[37:50] every single day is just because there's
[37:52] not enough thieves like that that's
[37:55] literally the problem you can't scale
[37:57] the fast enough um but the interesting
[38:00] thing about AI is that that is going to
[38:03] scale you know when I can have a picture
[38:05] of somebody and then I can do a video
[38:08] like I just did this on my computer the
[38:09] other day I turned my face into Selah
[38:11] hyek live on my computer with uh I think
[38:15] I was using face Fusion or was I using
[38:17] an animated no no yeah was it was it was
[38:20] face Fusion so like I have like a ton of
[38:22] AI software that I play around with all
[38:23] the time now it did not look good at all
[38:26] because my beard the B of my beard was
[38:28] still there so it was a very very creepy
[38:30] sah hyek um but uh but it was really
[38:32] funny I was showing it to my wife she
[38:34] was like don't ever show me that again
[38:35] what is wrong with you why have you done
[38:37] this um and and I just thought it was
[38:40] hilarious but uh like I was live I was
[38:44] live doing that I was live doing that on
[38:45] my MacBook and it's not even optimized
[38:48] for M1 so I was basically using CPU
[38:52] level and if I wanted to do it on my
[38:54] Linux machine be easy as cake because
[38:57] I've designed design this thing to have
[38:58] you know I've got two beastly gpus in
[39:00] this and 192 gigs of RAM so I can do
[39:03] live change my face now what does that
[39:05] mean if I can easily get an ID or I can
[39:08] use there's a there's a model now
[39:10] that makes a can't really tell it's fake
[39:13] ID and it's a small model too because
[39:16] it's just trained on like driver's
[39:19] licenses um and I can just generate an
[39:22] ID with whatever details that I want and
[39:23] it's like almost indistinguishable as
[39:26] like a picture how many things do you
[39:29] require as like proof of identity your
[39:31] kyc that is take a picture of your ID
[39:34] and take take a
[39:36] selfie I can do both of those on this
[39:38] computer easy with anybody that I want I
[39:41] guess I might have to shave my beard if
[39:43] I wanted to be soek but um uh what
[39:48] happens to credit card fraud when you
[39:50] cannot prove who someone is digitally
[39:55] anymore you need a different system you
[39:58] need a different system of
[40:01] identity um
[40:03] and that problem is just going to get
[40:05] worse every single year I was actually
[40:06] just talking about it with my wife uh
[40:08] yesterday because she was having like a
[40:09] big payment problem we were just trying
[40:11] to get a stroller I mean excuse me a new
[40:13] car seat for rad because he's outgrown
[40:16] his other one and uh it's not even like
[40:19] super expensive like $280 or something
[40:21] like that so it's not like like we're
[40:23] spending $10,000 and the bank's going to
[40:25] freak out and be like what did you did
[40:27] you you make this payment um and like
[40:30] there's like some sort of a problem we
[40:32] have to contact the the company and like
[40:35] confirm something on the PNC it's just
[40:38] like it's just like a nightmare and I
[40:39] was like I bet they're getting slammed
[40:41] with fraud right now like all of those
[40:43] numbers are up and AI is only making
[40:45] this easier in a long enough time scale
[40:49] when you can you know hit an API that
[40:52] pulls $20,000 worth of computation cost
[40:56] overnight
[40:57] and you have you have an irreversible
[40:59] service like they can't get that back
[41:02] they can't they can't like call up the
[41:03] Energy company be like um it was okay it
[41:05] was a fraudulent customer so we're just
[41:06] going to like not pay for that energy
[41:08] today um and uh uh so you have an
[41:12] irreversible proof of work service and
[41:14] then you also have exploding and easyto
[41:18] do fraud I think this this just keeps
[41:21] getting worse and worse until people
[41:22] realize you have to use an irreversible
[41:23] payment system you have to use something
[41:25] that settles immediate
[41:28] to pay for a service that settles
[41:31] immediately um and I mean I don't think
[41:33] it will be super quick because you still
[41:35] have to build trust in the Bitcoin
[41:36] Network and like I said the trust cycle
[41:38] is slow uh but I think it will speed it
[41:41] up because it will be there will be a
[41:43] degree of necessity um like if you have
[41:47] you know 90% of your Market is in Fiat
[41:49] credit card payments but there's 20% of
[41:53] that of that profit uh now is lost to to
[41:57] fraud to
[41:59] chargebacks uh to all sorts of problems
[42:02] and now you have 10% that's done in you
[42:05] know lightning and Bitcoin but you have
[42:07] zero fraud because the payment is the
[42:10] payment you know at what point does the
[42:12] feedback loop start to benefit well if I
[42:15] can get 1% more of Bitcoin and lightning
[42:19] service and take 1% away well that means
[42:22] I've got I've got like 0 2% less in
[42:25] fraud you know like like you could start
[42:27] doing the math on as we shift over and
[42:30] you know once that gets to like 30 40%
[42:33] you're like this is looking increasingly
[42:35] stupid that we like we should just push
[42:37] all towards this direction and like I
[42:39] said long timeline but I think it's kind
[42:41] of inevitable that you you have to have
[42:43] some sort of strong settlement system
[42:45] and key based ID in the world that we're
[42:48] heading into I I don't I at least I
[42:51] don't see a different solution um and
[42:53] I'm I'm looking for one maybe maybe
[42:55] there is like we're super creative
[42:58] humans are really creative people we're
[42:59] build everybody's building like
[43:01] crazy maybe AI comes up with a
[43:03] solution I don't know 21 Bitcoin is
[43:06] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[43:09] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[43:13] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[43:15] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[43:18] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[43:21] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[43:23] support this podcast use code Robin and
[43:27] click the link in the description I
[43:29] totally agree with that uh that Bitcoin
[43:31] is actually for that problem also to fix
[43:33] and um there like probably 50 questions
[43:37] I want to ask you just from the last 20
[43:41] minutes it's it's it's sorry I I ramble
[43:45] I ramble I have context and I just I
[43:48] just go for it so yeah that's that's
[43:51] that's amazing I love it a lot uh and uh
[43:54] the the main thing I think we we can now
[43:56] Focus on uh the second part or like the
[43:59] the later part now of the podcast um
[44:02] well we have all these factors that
[44:04] contribute to the Bitcoin adoption and
[44:06] we have uh EI also and EI is enhancing
[44:10] that I think also like that uh and there
[44:13] is uh more and more trust in Bitcoin and
[44:16] less and less trust in Fiat Fiat is
[44:18] starting to collapse more and more just
[44:21] like the last 50 years has shown and the
[44:23] next 50 years I think will not be
[44:25] different from that um what will happen
[44:28] on uh to a society which is completely
[44:32] on a Bitcoin standard with all the
[44:34] implications uh you just mentioned with
[44:36] trust gaining back I had one of my first
[44:38] podcasts that I ever had on was um uh a
[44:43] guy who said Bitcoin is a system based
[44:45] of love because you can actually
[44:48] trust the thing again and trust is
[44:52] deeply connected with love uh so what do
[44:55] you think will happen when when we have
[44:57] this complete sound money standard and
[44:59] we have this Utopia of only Bitcoin uh
[45:03] do you actually like first of all do you
[45:05] think this will happen in like the next
[45:07] 100 years in our lifetime or does it
[45:10] take um more than that because the trust
[45:13] is slower to to gain and what will then
[45:17] uh Society on that look like or does it
[45:20] look different
[45:22] even
[45:24] so like I said trust takes it's a it's a
[45:27] very slow Network effect um and it's a
[45:31] very hard one network effect um because
[45:35] you know trust has lost quickly built
[45:37] very very slowly
[45:40] um
[45:42] and I think honestly our move to a
[45:46] Bitcoin world
[45:49] is 10 to 15
[45:52] years um like I really like Alex fy's
[45:56] three generation Theory which would you
[45:58] know put us at
[45:59] 25ish 30 years maybe
[46:03] um I'm not so sure um I think there's
[46:08] there's an element like I I I basically
[46:10] after I read that article he made a very
[46:12] very strong AR argument for the three
[46:14] generations Theory and I love it and you
[46:16] know the you know one of the most potent
[46:18] tools for Change and like critical
[46:21] things for adaptation or what's the
[46:23] what's the what's the con uh the quote
[46:26] um
[46:27] uh science progresses one Death at a
[46:30] time you know something like that um I
[46:32] can't I can't remember who it is uh uh
[46:35] but uh it's like Newton or some you
[46:37] know somebody you would know uh but uh
[46:41] that you know you need a generation that
[46:43] lives in a world where Bitcoin like
[46:46] there are people who were born now who
[46:47] are 15 years old never knew a world
[46:50] without Bitcoin it always existed and
[46:54] once you have those people at 25 and 30
[46:57] and they're the base of a new growing
[47:01] economy you know that that 20 to 20 to
[47:04] 35 age range is really
[47:07] like what they are building and what
[47:09] they think about the world is where all
[47:11] of the change is going to occur or at
[47:13] least the bulk of the change in society
[47:15] is going to occur and I think we've
[47:17] reached a pace a a crazy crazy space
[47:21] when we're talking about the
[47:22] acceleration of Technology
[47:25] where we have disruptions on top of
[47:27] disruptions you know 100 years ago
[47:30] disruptive in systemic Technologies
[47:32] going back to the context of uh or the
[47:34] analogy of the piston engine you know
[47:36] most of its maintaining Technologies uh
[47:38] whereas disruptive Technologies are fair
[47:40] very very infrequent that's not the case
[47:43] anymore and uh one of the things that uh
[47:47] like there's a great book called
[47:50] um uh I think this is I think it's the
[47:52] cold start
[47:54] problem or maybe the secrets of San Hill
[47:56] Road
[47:57] no no no no it's uh the innovators hold
[48:00] on a second I've got it in my audio
[48:02] books um uh there's a great book by a
[48:05] guy from the 90s he's a he's a
[48:09] professor um and he's talking about the
[48:13] differences
[48:15] between innovator's dilemma the
[48:17] innovators dilemma by Clayton
[48:19] Christensen um and he talks about he he
[48:23] he uses that same analogy of the the
[48:26] maintaining techn versus the disruptive
[48:28] Technologies and how for a long time we
[48:30] thought of companies as you could you
[48:32] could build a base in like some sort of
[48:34] a product or service and then you can
[48:37] operate as like brilliant managers
[48:40] reflecting you know with your or or
[48:42] working with your customers and you know
[48:44] being efficient and not taking huge
[48:46] risks and looking for the big things in
[48:48] the market and that worked you could you
[48:51] could sustain a company like that for 50
[48:53] years 70 years aund you know a century
[48:55] even and that's not possible anymore
[48:57] sometime in the the 80s to 90s there
[49:01] were so
[49:03] many uh so many disruptive changes from
[49:06] 8 in discs to 5 in discs and from uh
[49:10] from uh magnetic to spinning discs like
[49:13] to like like disruptive changes in the
[49:14] context that the entire function and
[49:16] mode by which we would actually do these
[49:20] things shifted like really quickly you
[49:24] know like you know the first 50 years of
[49:27] the idea of recording audio like it was
[49:29] scratch it into a piece of vinyl you it
[49:32] was it was scratch it into a thing and
[49:33] then we went from CDs to digital like
[49:36] like we went in like super compressed
[49:39] time we went over like four different
[49:40] mediums from cassettes CDs and digital
[49:43] like 15 years 20 years something like
[49:45] that um and uh and this is accelerating
[49:48] all across the board and companies no
[49:50] longer can actually establish like like
[49:53] the actually being a good manager as a
[49:56] company will actually kill you now
[49:59] because if you're responding to your
[50:00] customers and you're just looking for
[50:02] the maintaining Innovations what you're
[50:05] actually doing is if you're not looking
[50:07] for something that will disrupt your
[50:09] business process like disrupt your
[50:11] entire model then you're going to miss
[50:13] it and you're just going to you're just
[50:15] going to die in the next cycle and the
[50:16] next cycle is four years away like like
[50:18] it's it's here every single time and
[50:20] we're in this weird place where we have
[50:22] disruptions on top of disruptions where
[50:25] we have a disruptive cycle occurring
[50:27] with a new technological framework or a
[50:28] new protocol layer and before it is even
[50:33] like reached any sort of serious
[50:36] maturity in its adoption cycle there's
[50:38] already the new thing that's going to
[50:39] disrupt it like like we're starting to
[50:42] like it used to be that you'd you know
[50:44] get on this S curve and then it would
[50:45] start to smooth out and then boom here's
[50:47] this new disruption and then it would
[50:49] get on an S curve and start to smooth
[50:51] out and these things were like really
[50:52] gapped together and now they're starting
[50:54] to compress so that like four or five of
[50:56] them are happening at the same time so
[50:59] the the comment or the the the concept
[51:02] of like uh the future is here it's just
[51:04] not evenly distributed is getting way
[51:06] worse because the all of the Futures are
[51:09] here and we don't even know like we're
[51:12] we're all the the pace at which humans
[51:14] are learning how to adapt and use things
[51:17] hasn't increased so if it still takes us
[51:19] 10 years to adopt and understand how a
[51:21] new technology is going to change things
[51:23] and how to integrate it in our lives but
[51:25] a new disruptive technology is happening
[51:27] every year and a half well we're going
[51:28] to be 10 we're going to be 10 behind you
[51:30] know as soon as we've adopted the the
[51:32] the one that we were trying to figure
[51:34] out um and so we're in this really weird
[51:37] place where everything is just massively
[51:41] accelerating uh what was the what was
[51:43] the context of the original question I'm
[51:44] sorry this was this was like laying the
[51:46] groundwork for something this uh how
[51:49] this Bitcoin world look like I think was
[51:51] the complete original question and how
[51:54] this Bitcoin standard will uh like have
[51:57] a change on society yes so the Bitcoin
[52:01] standard so the interesting thing is
[52:04] that when you have Fiat money it's like
[52:08] it's like Society moving everything is
[52:11] done through molasses like you're like
[52:12] knees Deep in water you know how you try
[52:16] to Sprint through water it's like a
[52:17] nightmare right it's like it's
[52:19] infuriating and you're like you're look
[52:21] an idiot because your your legs are
[52:22] flying out to the side because you're
[52:23] trying to get out of the water um this
[52:26] is this is essentially what Fiat Fiat
[52:28] money does to the society because it is
[52:31] a constant dis signal a a misinformation
[52:35] mechanism in the attempt to communicate
[52:37] value between each other because there
[52:41] there is no solid way to communicate
[52:43] value I mean it is it is money like it
[52:45] is an inter subjective thing it is only
[52:48] by the cost it is only by the comparison
[52:51] that we actually understand the value of
[52:52] anything you know like I'm I you know I
[52:54] can about my iPhone
[52:57] not letting me plug you know a USB thing
[52:59] into it or whatever I'm G be like ah
[53:00] this is this is annoying and it's not
[53:03] valuable but it only is in the context
[53:05] of like what it's related to is the fact
[53:07] that I there is some other device over
[53:08] here in which I can do that and so I
[53:10] want that but if you take my smartphone
[53:12] and all of its capabilities and the
[53:13] internet and you give it to somebody in
[53:15] 1890 it's worth a trillion dollar it's
[53:17] worth the entire world because it's it's
[53:19] a scope of existence I mean it's
[53:22] otherworldly it's literally a alien
[53:24] technology it's like it's like having a
[53:26] Harry Potter wand so in the context of
[53:30] like what it costs to achieve and what
[53:33] the alternatives are it's comparatively
[53:35] the most valuable thing in the world
[53:36] while I sit here and about you the
[53:38] fact that I it didn't plug in I got I
[53:40] got to get an adapter you know
[53:44] and so in that context we have it's a
[53:47] incredibly difficult thing to um uh
[53:50] communicate because it is all relative
[53:52] you know it's like speed you if you
[53:54] don't have anything to relate it to you
[53:55] could be moving a b jillion miles an
[53:57] hour technically you know in outer space
[53:59] and you're just sitting still like
[54:01] nothing's happening um value is that
[54:03] same way um and because it's inter
[54:06] subjective we have to have someone you
[54:08] have to have skin in the game in those
[54:09] decisions Fiat removes that skin in the
[54:12] game Fiat removes the ability to have
[54:15] accurate comparisons between you and I
[54:18] because money is not the same for you as
[54:20] it is for me and it's not the same for
[54:22] the central Banker or the finance guy as
[54:24] it is for the people at the bottom like
[54:26] we all have different relationships with
[54:28] money because the money is people
[54:30] there's just new printing new debt new
[54:32] this and that happening at every every
[54:34] different stage it's just constant
[54:35] floods of misinformation in the market
[54:38] which means that Bitcoin a Bitcoin
[54:40] standard will just be
[54:42] like instead of Knee Deep Water Solid
[54:46] Ground what becomes easier what things
[54:50] do you do that are so difficult or
[54:53] annoying in KNE deep water when you're
[54:55] on Solid Ground you're like oh we could
[54:56] do that we could pull that off oh no
[55:00] that makes perfect sense like that's not
[55:02] going to be that's not going to be hard
[55:03] we can run marathon why not why not I'm
[55:06] not going to do that in he deep
[55:07] water but I'll do it now and so it
[55:10] removes this huge misinformation signal
[55:12] and it's going to allow the spread I
[55:15] think it's actually critically necessary
[55:17] because thinking about like the layers
[55:19] of disruption the speed with which the
[55:22] new technology can disperse and actually
[55:24] be adopted is related to the ability to
[55:27] communicate its value which means that
[55:30] it might actually than God have the
[55:32] capacity to shorten that span to
[55:36] Distributing the future to as many
[55:37] people as possible as opposed to keeping
[55:39] it in some Niche corner and making it
[55:42] difficult to to to get out to the public
[55:44] to to do the most good like this is
[55:46] something that we actually saw during
[55:47] the 30s like during the Great Depression
[55:49] one of the people think a lot of people
[55:50] think that like during like huge
[55:52] economic Contra contractions um and
[55:54] depression periods the Innovation stops
[55:57] that's not true Innovation stops
[55:59] spreading we still have tons of new
[56:01] Innovations we still have tons of new
[56:03] like inventions and like fundamental
[56:05] ideas but they cannot get out from the
[56:07] market there's not the the the economic
[56:11] health to distribute it to people so it
[56:14] basically stays isolated until it's
[56:16] unlocked and that's why we had this huge
[56:18] boom after World War II ended because
[56:21] World War II and this
[56:23] giant like direct I'm going to control
[56:26] everything spending program for the
[56:28] government persisted a depression for 12
[56:30] years um that just eviscerated the
[56:33] economy and the ability for anything to
[56:34] be healthy and when they finally Let It
[56:36] Go when they finally brought everybody
[56:38] they they stopped wasting money on
[56:39] blowing up and they brought
[56:40] everybody back into the workforce to
[56:42] build stuff what do you know there was a
[56:44] boom they're like oh the war saved us
[56:46] and the didn't it's the war
[56:48] ended and it saved us you dummy but
[56:50] anyway um uh but it's a great example
[56:53] because if you think about that like
[56:56] again Innovation and disruption didn't
[56:58] the progress of Technology didn't stop
[57:00] during the 30s it was just prevented
[57:02] from getting out to people you can think
[57:05] about our current ERA very much like
[57:07] that because of how bad the Fiat system
[57:10] is we have an enormous amount of
[57:12] disruptive technology in fact we have
[57:14] more than we ever have because of the
[57:16] the natural progression of feedback
[57:17] loops new technologies enable the
[57:20] progression of more and better new
[57:22] technologies um like what is the
[57:23] internet I mean you can now disrupt
[57:25] things in a matter of hours you can now
[57:27] create a new software system as a
[57:29] 13-year-old kid in your garage because
[57:31] of the existence of the internet like
[57:32] everything accelerates the next thing um
[57:36] and but we have existed in this place
[57:39] where it's
[57:41] also been made incredibly slow to
[57:44] distribute incredibly difficult to to
[57:47] get out and it still has continued to do
[57:50] so despite it but just because of the
[57:52] this it's a force of nature like the the
[57:54] movement of technology I mean you look
[57:55] at last 100 years and the amount of just
[57:59] just obliteration of poverty across the
[58:01] world like people don't people don't
[58:02] realize most people and whine
[58:05] about something as it's being solved
[58:08] because when it's basically ubiquitous
[58:10] nobody complains about it like nobody
[58:12] had Candlelight visuals about poverty in
[58:15] the 1890s everybody was poor poor was
[58:17] normal you know it's only when you start
[58:21] to realize that this could actually be
[58:23] solved that everybody complains about it
[58:25] everybody says this is awful can't
[58:26] believe we've allowed this to happen
[58:27] it's like no this was the norm now you
[58:29] realize that there's a way out and now
[58:31] you're angry at it um and uh
[58:37] so excuse me so going back to the
[58:40] concept of Bitcoin
[58:42] standard I I I think I think we'll
[58:44] witness a Rena as close
[58:47] to what we could comprehend as a
[58:49] Renaissance um we're talking about
[58:52] removing so much friction in the market
[58:53] we're talking about removing political
[58:55] barriers across the world so that we can
[58:57] interact with other markets we're
[58:58] talking about AI which will remove L uh
[59:01] linguistic and cultural barriers across
[59:03] the world to add to it I really think it
[59:06] won't be very long before I'll have a
[59:07] Spanish version of Bitcoin audible read
[59:09] in my voice with my tonality and my
[59:11] emphasis I I don't speak Spanish you
[59:14] know um and I don't think it's it's like
[59:18] really soon like really soon that I
[59:19] could have my show in any language that
[59:21] I wanted um and uh uh in fact I can
[59:26] basically do it it just kind of sucks
[59:28] right now you know it's like 90% of the
[59:30] way there um in fact I might actually do
[59:33] an investment of just having like
[59:34] somebody who natively speaks Spanish
[59:36] make the corrections um but it's it's
[59:38] like a combination of tools but it's
[59:40] just like we're just barriers barriers
[59:42] are
[59:43] plummeting and we don't know what the
[59:46] outcomes we don't know what a world
[59:48] looks like without those
[59:49] barriers but I'll tell you it it it
[59:52] looks it it's at least in order of
[59:55] magnitude more productive more uh faster
[59:59] and uh more cleanly
[60:03] communicated than what we have now um
[60:06] and it's it is going to be if nothing
[60:10] else is going to be a hell of a time to
[60:12] live through like it's It's just
[60:14] sometimes I just think
[60:16] like of the entire the entire path of
[60:22] History like and the little blip that we
[60:26] are at at this crazy acceleration curve
[60:30] and when sound money is actually
[60:33] reinstituted at a scale that it was
[60:35] never possible like gold could never
[60:37] produce a society the way a digital a
[60:41] digital commodity and a a uh digital
[60:43] communication protocol that is genuinely
[60:46] Global could do like like you're talking
[60:49] about the difference between a digital
[60:50] world and a and a physical world and
[60:52] what
[60:54] is what that potential is is like it's a
[60:58] thousandfold you know like it just they
[61:00] they you you can't compare the two
[61:03] um and like we're here like right when
[61:07] this is really
[61:09] starting I think people think it's like
[61:11] oh look at you know what's happened in
[61:12] like the last 30 years the internet's
[61:13] like gotten big no it literally is just
[61:16] started like like we're in the curve of
[61:18] that whole transition
[61:21] and it's getting faster and it's
[61:23] accelerating that's why I think you know
[61:26] 99% of this Bitcoin Supply will be here
[61:28] in
[61:29] 2034 um and that last 1% will take 100
[61:33] years more more than that
[61:36] to um to
[61:42] distribute I don't I don't see how we
[61:43] make it to the 1930 I mean the 1930s I
[61:46] don't see how we don't make it through
[61:47] the
[61:48] 2030s uh without a Bitcoin standard um
[61:52] with the way things are going now and
[61:54] the fact that feedback loop catch up
[61:56] quick um amazing gradually then
[62:00] suddenly and uh I say this so many times
[62:03] on the podcast it's it's like whenever I
[62:05] think of what we are just now living
[62:08] through I can only think of what a time
[62:10] to be alive like what what what
[62:12] privilege and what like how grateful can
[62:15] we be to to live right now and yeah
[62:18] there's also like so many things in in
[62:21] in there that we we we should be talking
[62:23] about and I think um I I just thought of
[62:26] of of something that uh that I will will
[62:29] do now on the podcast and um I because I
[62:33] did did now I never had a guest on two
[62:36] times uh so I want to have guests on
[62:39] also a second round but like with a year
[62:42] or something like that in between uh and
[62:46] uh and I I never thought that before but
[62:50] if if I have questions listening to you
[62:52] I probably listeners also do this
[62:54] podcast have question questions about
[62:56] that so please if you have a question
[62:58] the guys want just leave it in the
[63:00] comment and I when I have a second round
[63:03] with you I will take this also as a
[63:05] basis uh that we can make a second
[63:08] episode and then we might have some
[63:11] interesting questions an interesting uh
[63:14] influence in that I started sometimes
[63:16] doing it I think I did it with Jeff poof
[63:18] when I had him on like a few weeks ago I
[63:20] asked the community what question should
[63:22] I ask Booth is great man he's he's Al
[63:26] amazing man to to listen to uh and and
[63:29] to interview and yeah then I will I will
[63:32] do that and we're coming to the end
[63:35] routine where the previous guest is like
[63:38] a little bit like the blockchain the
[63:39] previous guest is asking a question for
[63:41] the next guest without knowing who who
[63:42] the next guest is uh and uh then you can
[63:46] also you will also then ask a question
[63:48] to the next guest without knowing who
[63:50] next guest is um and the question to you
[63:54] from the previous guest is about real
[63:57] estate and he talked a little bit on the
[63:59] podcast how um the the homeowners now
[64:04] are old and they will die soon uh and
[64:08] how real estate is such a worse
[64:11] investment uh against Bitcoin when you
[64:14] really compare it but still so many
[64:16] people have the belief system that oh I
[64:20] have to have a home I want to invest in
[64:21] and this is kind of my savings account I
[64:23] take a credit against it and then I can
[64:26] I can like take my home as my main
[64:29] savings account and misuse a home as a
[64:31] savings account um and the the fleeing
[64:35] of the the real estate to bitcoin it's
[64:38] like the demonetization of of of real
[64:40] estate and and he was and we kind of
[64:43] touched on it when you talked about
[64:45] Bitcoin standard how fast it will go um
[64:48] and he talked about
[64:50] how how fast do you think it will go
[64:54] that we are coming to a collapsing house
[64:57] prices to Affordable house prices make
[64:59] housing Bitcoin makes I I think so house
[65:02] prices affordable again uh do you think
[65:05] to have a timeline where like okay this
[65:07] will happen in the next five 10 years
[65:09] and I think it's was kind of in the last
[65:12] question in there uh but is this
[65:15] comparable yeah 100% um I I think I
[65:19] think when you look at like kind of a
[65:20] 10year time frame um as Bitcoin really
[65:23] settles in as a trusted and asset that's
[65:26] not going anywhere um it will be
[65:30] especially when we talk about like
[65:32] closing costs and uh political risk um
[65:36] the cost of real estate will start being
[65:39] weighed against the cost of just buying
[65:41] Bitcoin and holding it um because a huge
[65:45] amount of the real estate market is
[65:47] about storing value it is a huge portion
[65:50] of it is store of value
[65:52] like uh one of the statistics I heard on
[65:55] it is that
[65:56] a third a third of luxury housing in the
[66:01] Manhattan area sits empty all
[66:04] year a
[66:06] third like that's insane it like it gets
[66:09] used for nothing people are just sitting
[66:11] on it because it's going to go up in
[66:13] value but it's not it goes up in nominal
[66:16] price not
[66:17] value
[66:19] and uh the only reason it like I think
[66:22] real estate is actually the better the
[66:25] better form of uh calculating inflation
[66:29] as we have um because it's the
[66:32] predominant store of value I think uh in
[66:35] my opinion
[66:37] for uh getting around the inflation
[66:40] problem and people don't know it like
[66:41] even for like it is the middle class
[66:43] savings account is equity in your home
[66:46] uh like I I bought this house for like
[66:49] this was a small like I was trying to
[66:51] spend as little as I possibly could I
[66:52] even got a FHA loan I tried to put as
[66:55] little bit coin into it as possible
[66:56] because you know seven years ago like I
[66:59] saw bitcoin's future and trajectory um
[67:03] and I bought this house for $157,000 it
[67:05] was 100% fix me up like it was it was it
[67:09] had some
[67:10] problems uh and uh there is I haven't
[67:14] done like a an appraisal on it
[67:18] for you know oh we ripped out this
[67:20] rotten MDF kitchen and we put in nice
[67:23] custom wood cabinets and quartz
[67:25] countertops oh we completely remodeled
[67:28] two bathrooms oh I dug out the 8ot crawl
[67:32] space I excavated around it waterproofed
[67:36] the whole thing and now it's a Concrete
[67:38] basement and I've added you know 1100
[67:40] square foot to square feet to the house
[67:43] none of that is being calculated if you
[67:45] just look at the Zillow estimate for
[67:48] what it costs to have this house
[67:49] according to its ignorant thinking or
[67:52] its ignorant perspective that it's just
[67:54] the same house as it was when I bought
[67:56] it virtually it's like
[68:03] $360,000 it's not worth like it it
[68:05] didn't get worth more the dollar got
[68:09] shittier the dollar lost value like
[68:12] there are people and if I sold it I'd
[68:14] pay capital gains I'd pay capital gains
[68:17] on getting around inflation and if I you
[68:21] know sold it for this I can't buy more
[68:23] house I can't like go you know to the
[68:26] other side of town and buy something way
[68:28] bigger i' buy the same
[68:30] thing like and if you calculate it for
[68:34] it's like probably like $450,000 if you
[68:36] calculate what I've actually done to it
[68:38] like in the fact that it's like way way
[68:40] better condition than when I got it um
[68:44] and like that's crazy that's crazy
[68:47] that's like that is that is the
[68:48] destruction of a currency right there
[68:51] like if you don't if you're not framing
[68:53] it right you just don't understand how
[68:56] awful that is from the context of money
[68:58] that's why Bitcoin as a pure price
[69:00] signal is going to completely change the
[69:01] game because my entire relationship to
[69:05] this house is the fact that like I need
[69:06] it for utility I'm not I'm not using it
[69:08] to hedge against the dollar I'm holding
[69:10] the debt to hedge against the dollar so
[69:12] that I don't have to sell my Bitcoin but
[69:14] my Bitcoin is my pricing mechanism what
[69:17] it will cost me in Bitcoin over that
[69:18] time is how I make my decisions so I buy
[69:22] this house not because I think of it as
[69:24] an investment I think of it as a l in
[69:25] Bitcoin but I need a house I'm we're
[69:28] start we have a family you know like I
[69:30] want to have like 16 more
[69:32] kids and so like it is a utility cost to
[69:38] me like I'm buying it for its utility it
[69:40] is not an investment anymore and that
[69:43] mind shift that that shift in mental
[69:45] framing will start to occur more and
[69:48] more at a larger and larger degree as
[69:50] the trust Network as the the trust
[69:53] adoption of bit coin grows and real
[69:57] estate will be priced real estate won't
[70:00] sit empty real estate will not sit empty
[70:03] because that means that your opportunity
[70:06] cost to have
[70:08] Bitcoin is going to just keeping up with
[70:10] inflation and still paying capital
[70:12] gains so you're doing worse than just
[70:16] just leaving just exiting the real
[70:18] estate which means that real estate
[70:20] prices will plummet but I think it will
[70:21] actually accelerate faster um uh
[70:25] specifically because like the commercial
[70:26] real estate market has imploded since
[70:30] 2020 and it's only because of the
[70:32] btfp um uh the the financing program
[70:36] that it's essentially not come home to
[70:37] roost yet uh and I think
[70:41] when when that kind of like fully
[70:43] implodes and we get our unraveling of
[70:45] the banking crisis there which has
[70:47] started with in uh the New York
[70:49] Community Bank um I think probably like
[70:51] Zion and um uh like m
[70:55] Wells Fargo is actually really exposed
[70:58] to this one I think it's like
[71:00] 22% of their their reserves are in
[71:03] commercial real
[71:04] estate um uh that's a that's a big one
[71:08] that would be bad um but anyway it's
[71:10] gonna it's gonna be really interesting
[71:11] to watch that unfold and uh I think
[71:13] there could be a
[71:14] second like I think we'll have kind of a
[71:17] general real estate collapse and it'll
[71:19] be interesting to see how that plays
[71:21] into it because if I was thinking about
[71:22] like just a normal progression from one
[71:24] to the other
[71:25] Bitcoin would take 10 years but it could
[71:28] be you know two years and then a heavy
[71:30] acceleration in that direction um and uh
[71:33] as you know a serious banking crisis and
[71:36] real estate crisis unfolds um in the
[71:39] debt
[71:39] markets and a feedback
[71:42] loop for a negative feedback loop for
[71:45] Fiat and for real estate will accelerate
[71:50] not slow down you know like like it's
[71:53] it's unlikely to reach some sort of
[71:54] plateau
[71:56] let me give you an example so when
[71:58] Bitcoin starts to become like like let's
[72:00] say like a bad policy gets implemented
[72:01] and Bitcoin goes up 20% like it becomes
[72:04] this Extremely Loud very iny face
[72:08] indicator of the potential Market
[72:10] Fallout of policymaking policy decisions
[72:13] and like what's going on in the credit
[72:15] markets um as it starts to do that when
[72:19] it becomes A5 trillion dollar market A9
[72:22] trillion Doll
[72:24] Market you'll start to see it show up in
[72:26] Fiat it won't just be that Bitcoin goes
[72:29] up it'll be that Fiat dips 1%
[72:34] 2% immediately like
[72:37] fast and Fiat will become increasingly
[72:40] volatile in the negative and Bitcoin
[72:44] will continue to be higher will continue
[72:47] to be up and when that happens and it's
[72:51] recognizable it becomes visible on the
[72:54] Fiat side
[72:56] well then it becomes even dumber to not
[72:58] have some exposure to bitcoin and to
[73:02] like the that that feedback loop becomes
[73:05] more exaggerated and then when people
[73:07] say like Bitcoin is volatile it's like
[73:08] Fiat is volatile they made a decision
[73:10] today and it fell
[73:12] 3% and when you start having that sort
[73:15] of when it simply is you can see when
[73:19] you can see it happening very very
[73:22] quickly is when
[73:26] I I don't think there's any reversing
[73:28] like I think you've hit the point of no
[73:29] return where it's just going to continue
[73:31] to accelerate because you add another $2
[73:33] trillion dollar to the Bitcoin market
[73:35] and now every single move you know right
[73:38] now we're in this place where Bitcoin is
[73:40] small enough that it like moves like
[73:42] crazy and dollar is so huge that it's
[73:45] just like really hard to see anything
[73:47] but as they get
[73:48] closer the and you start to see little
[73:50] movements like I I think you just shift
[73:54] you know like you you eventually just
[73:57] one's only going down and one's only
[73:59] going up on a long enough timeline and
[74:01] once you start to see those Vol that
[74:03] volatility show up on both sides of the
[74:06] essentially the you know the river
[74:07] you're pouring water from one to the
[74:09] other and then you start to notice that
[74:10] the water is changing over here because
[74:13] this Mark this bucket is now big enough
[74:16] um I think it
[74:18] accelerates really fast um the because
[74:22] price signals are everything and and
[74:24] right now it's not visible right now you
[74:26] still can't see it because bitcoin's
[74:27] very small it really is small when you
[74:29] talk about like its actual market cap um
[74:33] so I would I would really love to
[74:36] reassess in three years to see where I
[74:39] think it is um and I think in seven
[74:42] years it'll be a very very interesting
[74:44] conversation um in fact seven years we
[74:46] may be looking back and thinking like oh
[74:48] yeah this is we're already we're already
[74:50] past that
[74:52] point where that market can't oper
[74:55] operate as if Bitcoin doesn't exist it
[74:58] still can but I don't think it will for
[75:00] very
[75:01] long yeah definitely I can 100 100%
[75:05] subscribe to that and uh I think it was
[75:08] an astonishing episode with you you're
[75:11] really really insightful person you you
[75:14] read and listen sorry for the rambling
[75:16] thing it's like they go it's it's it's
[75:19] it's always crazy good to see if someone
[75:23] actually reads a lot like it's clear
[75:26] that you have so much information I read
[75:27] more about Bitcoin than anybody else you
[75:29] know what are you talking about yeah
[75:32] right so and this is uh that's why it's
[75:34] such an amazing conversation with you
[75:36] and I had like I think I got to one yeah
[75:40] one fifth of my my
[75:43] questions oh my God I always try to over
[75:46] prepare and then let the conversation
[75:48] flow freely uh but uh thank you so much
[75:52] uh for being on thank you so much for
[75:54] for taking the time and on my show I
[75:56] definitely want to be make a second
[75:58] round and maybe next year or something
[76:00] like that and uh yeah where can people
[76:04] ask you directly questions where can
[76:05] people reach out to you where can people
[76:07] find you the best way yeah yeah I am on
[76:11] uh Twitter obviously uh that's still a
[76:13] great way to hit me up in DMS um though
[76:16] they limit now who can send DMS and like
[76:19] I I I filter through a crap a ton of
[76:23] crap um so if it takes me a week to get
[76:26] to you I apologize um if it takes me a
[76:29] month I that's my bad but uh still dming
[76:33] on Twitter is still a useful thing uh
[76:35] hitting me up on telegram is actually
[76:38] probably a higher hit rate um noer is a
[76:41] good one too I'm at the guy Swan on all
[76:43] of it just the guy Swan Swan with two
[76:46] ends um and of course you can check out
[76:48] Bitcoin audible uh AI Unchained uh and
[76:52] I've got another project actually that's
[76:53] been in the works for a little but um
[76:55] that'll come out soon on the show side
[76:57] and then I've also got a development
[76:58] project that we've been working on so
[77:00] lots lots of stuff to come uh love to
[77:03] check those out and I've been trying to
[77:05] do a lot of little like explainer like
[77:08] I've been referring to them as guys two
[77:09] SATs uh uh my two SATs videos where I'm
[77:13] trying to distill because I have the I'm
[77:15] gonna tell you something you don't know
[77:17] but I have a tendency to ramble for an
[77:19] hour on a topic when asked a question
[77:23] and I'm trying to figure out I'm trying
[77:24] to do my best to distill this down
[77:26] into like three minutes um and it's very
[77:30] very hard it takes a week to to really
[77:34] like bring it down you know edit it to
[77:37] what the heart of the argument is um but
[77:39] I'm trying to do that in videos and
[77:41] they've done really really well they've
[77:42] gotten a lot of attention so um I think
[77:45] that's a really good one uh and then of
[77:47] course Keat um I know a lot of people
[77:49] don't know about Keat uh but honest to
[77:52] God when I think about like the most
[77:54] important things that are happening
[77:56] right now and the the kind of critical
[77:59] technological changes when I think about
[78:00] the layers of disruption that I
[78:02] mentioned um I think Bitcoin Ai noer and
[78:06] Keat well not Keat ho punch is the
[78:09] protocol Keat is just kind of an
[78:10] application built on top of it but it's
[78:12] the proof of concept that holy this
[78:15] works um check it out if you haven't um
[78:18] I think it is the most unsung of the
[78:20] most important things that are happening
[78:22] right now and I spend my whole day on it
[78:25] um so uh definitely check that out too
[78:28] yeah perfect thank you for for taking
[78:31] for for taking the time oh wait do am I
[78:34] asking a question for the next guy uh
[78:36] yes I usually do it offline but you can
[78:38] also do it uh while we Rec okay got you
[78:41] I I'll make it very simple I'll make it
[78:43] very simple is what's the most important
[78:45] thing perfect what's the most important
[78:47] thing that's
[78:49] it love it uh it's it's fascinating for
[78:52] me because I have now you're my 77th
