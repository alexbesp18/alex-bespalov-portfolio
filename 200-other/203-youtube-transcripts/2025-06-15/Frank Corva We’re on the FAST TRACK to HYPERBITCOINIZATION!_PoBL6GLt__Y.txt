[00:00] that's probably your quickest route to
[00:02] hyperbitcoinization because if AI is
[00:04] just using it to transact and there's no
[00:07] converting it back to Fiat or anything
[00:08] else just becoming part of a system the
[00:11] same way it is in circular economies or
[00:13] whatever else but with AI on a much
[00:14] bigger scale I ended up very very
[00:16] strangely meeting the person who created
[00:19] the financial instrument that collapsed
[00:20] the global economy in 2008 so his name
[00:23] is Lou reneer he invented mortgage back
[00:25] Securities for the first time in human
[00:27] history we have a piece of technology
[00:29] Financial Tech technology that's more
[00:31] powerful in the hands of an individual
[00:32] than it is in the hands of a government
[00:34] having one standard based protocol money
[00:37] it's a game changer Bitcoin and human
[00:39] rights are inextricably linked dollar
[00:40] has lost 99% of its purchasing power
[00:43] which is making people depressed and
[00:44] putting them on you know prescription
[00:46] drugs and they you know and the suicide
[00:47] rate is at all-time highs instead it's
[00:49] like it's immigrants stealing your jobs
[00:51] it's this it's easier to play on
[00:52] people's fears when they don't feel
[00:54] secure about their financial future the
[00:55] Venezuelan Bolivar to the dollar the
[00:57] legal exchange rate was like 4 5 to1 and
[01:01] I was probably getting something like 13
[01:03] to1 in the black market now that number
[01:05] is like 200 cadrillion to one it was a
[01:08] former US president making the first
[01:09] public Bitcoin transaction that's a
[01:11] historical moment I want Bitcoin to
[01:13] become normalized and one of the ways to
[01:15] do this is to get bigger people talking
[01:16] about it so in this regard I think Trump
[01:18] has done it a
[01:20] [Music]
[01:23] service you said uh right before we
[01:25] started that you have been really
[01:27] interesting live before even coming into
[01:29] Bitcoin coin which made you understand
[01:31] or appreciate what what Bitcoin is I
[01:33] really laughed it also with Venezuela
[01:35] and all those uh backgrounds maybe just
[01:37] just that there where you coming from
[01:39] and why did this impact how you think
[01:42] about Bitcoin yeah for sure um so yeah
[01:46] before getting into Bitcoin I had
[01:48] different lives almost um going way way
[01:50] back I was in the music industry that
[01:52] was like from my late teenage years
[01:54] through my mid 20s um but even during
[01:57] those years I did a lot of traveling
[01:59] throughout uh what gets now termed the
[02:01] global South so I studied in Brazil
[02:04] studied in Mexico both of those had to
[02:06] do uh where with children's
[02:08] education um both of those research
[02:10] trips um I had traveled you know during
[02:13] my time off in the music industry I
[02:14] would travel to places like Peru um but
[02:17] then um when I left the music industry
[02:20] uh I was teaching and doing sort of
[02:22] different sorts of I guess you would say
[02:24] human rights work um and it brought me
[02:26] at one point to Venezuela where I lived
[02:28] under the Chavez regime and I saw
[02:30] currency debasement happen in real time
[02:33] so just to give some example of what
[02:35] that looked like I think while I was
[02:36] living there the Venezuelan Bol to the
[02:39] dollar the legal exchange rate was like
[02:41] 4.5 to one and I was probably getting
[02:44] something like 13 to one in the black
[02:46] market now that number is like 200
[02:49] cadrillion to one it's not you know the
[02:51] money doesn't even it's they don't even
[02:52] use their own money anymore they just
[02:54] use dollars or in some cases
[02:56] Bitcoin um and before that I was
[02:59] actually living in rural Ghana which was
[03:01] a really strange thing as I was
[03:03] transitioning out of the music business
[03:06] and into uh into what became my teaching
[03:09] and sort of Human Rights work that I did
[03:11] for about 12 years um I ended up very
[03:15] very strangely meeting the person who
[03:17] created the financial instrument that
[03:19] collapsed the global economy in 2008 so
[03:21] his name is Lou rener he invented
[03:24] mortgage back Securities I'm not sure if
[03:26] you're familiar with what those are yeah
[03:28] so I was his waiter at a restaurant I
[03:30] couldn't make this up in a million years
[03:31] if I tried and it was uh he's he
[03:33] apparently was from my hometown and I
[03:35] had moved out of New York City where I
[03:37] live just to I spent a little bit of
[03:39] time with my family on Long Island in my
[03:41] mid 20s was just waiting tables while I
[03:43] figured out what to do next he and I got
[03:45] to talking um I had told him I had
[03:47] traveled a little bit in Africa Latin at
[03:50] that point no just Latin America and he
[03:52] just came one in one day and said hey
[03:53] could you go and work on this trade
[03:55] school for me that I'm helping to fund
[03:56] in a rural part of Ghana so I learned a
[03:58] lot about
[04:00] um living in you know rural western
[04:03] Africa what people have access to what
[04:05] they don't have access to one of the
[04:07] things we did with that project was
[04:08] bring internet to uh to the Village
[04:12] which was about four or five hours from
[04:13] the capital Acra which was the first
[04:15] time that people there had been able to
[04:17] sort of log on and have decent streaming
[04:19] internet which was quite a quite
[04:23] a wild sort of thing to experience with
[04:26] you know the first time to see people
[04:28] using the internet like that was quite
[04:30] wild um but yeah after that was
[04:32] Venezuela I did a little bit of work
[04:34] with the UN in Namibia as well but
[04:36] learned a lot during these years and I
[04:38] wasn't into Bitcoin during any of this
[04:40] this is between like 2010 and
[04:43] 2016 is during these years sort of just
[04:47] saw what systems around the world
[04:49] offered people and what they didn't and
[04:52] uh you know I was taking physical and
[04:54] mental notes I was documenting a lot of
[04:56] it on a Blog but um yeah came stumbled
[05:00] upon Bitcoin uh I think it might have
[05:03] been the first week of 2018 or late
[05:06] 2017 and it was a sort of instant there
[05:08] was like an instant feeling of like
[05:10] someone described it to me at a bar one
[05:12] night and there was no like oh that's a
[05:14] scam it was just I mean like 100% I know
[05:17] what problems this would solve I get
[05:18] this idea of of hard money like it it
[05:21] all clicked for me immediately and I
[05:22] sort of my whole life sort of changed
[05:25] trajectory from that moment on I think
[05:28] wait you you worked for the guy who
[05:30] invented the mortgage back Securities
[05:32] which later caused the collapse
[05:35] in8 it had already happened actually so
[05:37] I would be I would be waiting on his
[05:39] table at the restaurant and he would be
[05:41] on the TV like being interviewed by the
[05:44] news or whatever and he'd be like yeah I
[05:46] didn't mean to do this blah blah blah it
[05:48] was a very surreal thing it was a very
[05:50] very weird thing to be a part of it so
[05:51] that was like I was his waiter it was
[05:53] like
[05:56] 2008 to 2010 or so 2011 yeah I mean he
[06:02] he invented the concept but the banks
[06:05] and all the things like they really use
[06:07] it like it's it's not entirely his fault
[06:09] I guess yeah I I would honestly argue I
[06:12] would recommend to everybody if you want
[06:13] to learn more about that there's a book
[06:15] called liars poker he's also featured in
[06:18] the movie they made I'm forgetting what
[06:20] was it called the movie that came out
[06:23] off the Michael Lewis book The Big Short
[06:25] so he's mentioned in the beginning of
[06:26] the big short but liars poker is really
[06:28] about him and it was interesting he's
[06:30] he's a genius he's maybe the smartest
[06:32] person I've ever met but he's also a
[06:34] College Dropout photographic memory just
[06:36] a very very intelligent human being um
[06:39] and when he was at at the time I think
[06:41] the bank was Solomon Brothers that's
[06:43] where he invented it started in the mail
[06:44] room worked his way up created this
[06:47] financial instrument but what happened
[06:49] was and I'm not saying this was the
[06:50] right way for things to be done it's not
[06:52] but he essentially created the police
[06:54] force that was looking at all the
[06:55] mortgages as they were being securitized
[06:57] as they were putting being put in into
[06:59] this sort of securitized financial asset
[07:02] and when he got fired which happened as
[07:04] a result of I think the number one at
[07:06] Solomon Brothers just feeling threatened
[07:09] by you know he's like this guy's going
[07:10] to take over he fired him and then
[07:12] basically all of those people who were
[07:14] due doing due diligence on the mortgage
[07:16] back on the Securities everything they
[07:18] were all let go of too so this whole
[07:20] culture of like okay we have this
[07:21] financial product but we're sort of
[07:23] like I wouldn't say regulating it
[07:26] ourselves but we're sort of doing our
[07:27] homework to make sure that the product
[07:29] is actually
[07:30] sound and people can have their opinions
[07:32] on whether a product like that should
[07:33] even exist I have my opinions on it for
[07:36] sure but um yeah so when he was let go
[07:38] that's when he said it this will fall
[07:40] apart this will unravel and it will
[07:41] cause a financial collapse he he knew
[07:43] that from this second that he was let go
[07:45] and that nobody was really like quote
[07:46] unquote policing this
[07:48] anymore wait this well I saw a big shot
[07:51] I think like two three times but it has
[07:53] been a while there's in the beginning a
[07:55] scene where someone gets fired is that
[07:57] the guy yeah so there quote from that
[08:00] beginning scene yes it's in the
[08:01] beginning I think he gets fired but he
[08:03] says um there's somebody on this planet
[08:05] who has impacted your life more than
[08:07] Michael Jordan more than the iPod and
[08:08] most of you don't know his name his name
[08:10] is l Riner that was that's the guy in
[08:12] the beginning of the movie I was his
[08:13] waiter which was really weird yeah
[08:15] that's that's crazy yeah I never
[08:17] researched that that part really cool um
[08:19] and was that like how was that time
[08:22] around 2008 and that was probably also a
[08:24] reason why you then instantly got
[08:27] Bitcoin like it clicked instantly yeah
[08:30] you know it's funny you just brought
[08:31] this back I I got chills when I thought
[08:33] about it around that time I had read a
[08:35] book by Matt taibe called griftopia so
[08:38] mat taibi is a pretty well-known
[08:39] American journalist he he still does
[08:42] okay work I like what he does um he
[08:44] covers a lot of politics now but this
[08:46] book griftopia really really dissected
[08:49] the financial crisis and what happened
[08:51] and and how corrupt everything was and
[08:54] yada yada yada um it changed my life
[08:57] this book and it's even the way he wrote
[08:59] it it was very irreverent very sort of s
[09:02] like [ __ ] you sort of thing and it was
[09:03] like okay now I'm reading this thing
[09:05] that has really good information but it
[09:06] also has this sort of attitude and so
[09:09] without even knowing it I didn't start
[09:10] writing about money or Finance back then
[09:13] I sort of was like there was a part of
[09:15] me that it really resonated deeply with
[09:17] and I was like I want to do something
[09:19] like this guy did the problem was even
[09:22] as I studied traditional finance and I
[09:24] even went back and studied it after I
[09:26] found Bitcoin I did part of my masters
[09:28] in B business administ ation it puts me
[09:30] to sleep it's so boring it it does
[09:32] nothing for me like it just it just does
[09:35] it's not interesting to me and also it's
[09:37] just insanely corrupt it's like an old
[09:39] boys club and I just have very little
[09:41] interest in being involved with it
[09:43] certain jobs have you know where I've
[09:44] been writing they've asked me to do some
[09:46] like trafi writing and I literally fall
[09:48] asleep at my desk I just don't like
[09:49] doing it it doesn't do anything for me
[09:51] so I mean unless I'm writing about
[09:53] something related to like corruption
[09:55] exposing some sort of Scandal but I
[09:57] haven't really been put in many of those
[09:58] situations
[10:00] um but back to your point yeah so I was
[10:02] really it was a very strange period
[10:05] where I was sort of being prepped for
[10:08] like for Bitcoin so I'm with this guy
[10:10] liner he's the guy that invented this
[10:13] tool that collapses the global economy
[10:14] Bitcoin is created out of that I had no
[10:16] idea what it was Back Then I then moved
[10:19] to a place in rural Africa where people
[10:21] have very limited resources very little
[10:23] access to funds Capital Credit all of
[10:25] this stuff and then I live in Chavez's
[10:28] Venezuela where current currency is
[10:29] being debased exponentially in real time
[10:32] so I had this three or four years where
[10:34] I was really exposed to why Bitcoin is
[10:36] necessary without having an
[10:38] understanding of what without even I
[10:39] mean Bitcoin existed back then that's
[10:42] the first Epoch 2009 to 2012 and I just
[10:45] wasn't like I'm not I wasn't a radical
[10:49] enough of a person to be into it I think
[10:50] a lot of the people back then were like
[10:52] you know the cipher punks and like the
[10:54] super hardcore Libertarians and Narco
[10:56] capitalists I'm very grateful for them
[10:58] and what they created but just wasn't
[10:59] that was not like the crowd that I was
[11:01] running with back then yeah it's it's
[11:04] even like in 2015 16 uh it was probably
[11:08] still hard like I the first touch point
[11:10] for me was 2017 and I still fought three
[11:14] years long straight that it's a scam so
[11:16] like it took me till 2020 uh to figure
[11:19] it out I mean now I'm uh I got Bitcoin
[11:22] with like 20 21 years old so it was
[11:25] quite early for me but yeah that's uh
[11:27] that's that that was still really how do
[11:29] you think Bitcoin will change those
[11:33] power scales in the world as we already
[11:35] talked a little bit of about like this
[11:37] this banking things and also with human
[11:39] rights how how will Bitcoin change those
[11:41] scales one of the best ways I ever heard
[11:43] it put and in some ways it's just simple
[11:45] and in some ways it's not um I was uh I
[11:49] can't think of her name Noel aeson she
[11:50] has a daily newsletter called crypto is
[11:52] macro now and she writes for coindesk
[11:54] from time to time and she's just a very
[11:56] lovely human being but she said for the
[11:58] first time in human history we have a
[12:00] piece of technology Financial technology
[12:02] that's more powerful in the hands of an
[12:04] individual than it is in the hands of a
[12:06] government which means inherently for
[12:08] right it's like when you think about it
[12:09] like that it's inherently more powerful
[12:11] for an individual to hold Bitcoin than
[12:13] it is for a government it's not that it
[12:14] might not help a government I mean the
[12:17] United States is talking about a a
[12:19] treasury Reserve asset Bitcoin has a
[12:21] treasury Reserve asset something that
[12:23] they'll save to help pay off their debt
[12:25] that's great but I think it's inherently
[12:27] more powerful especially in a highly
[12:28] inflation environment or if you live
[12:30] under an authoritarian regime to have
[12:32] something like Bitcoin that you can then
[12:35] um transact with not only that but save
[12:37] you know the value of your your labor
[12:39] and time in um how that all plays out I
[12:43] don't know I think some people I don't
[12:46] know because Trump is on board or black
[12:48] rock is on board I think some people
[12:50] sort of think we won I'm not in that
[12:52] camp I I do what I do it's very Mission
[12:55] based uh very similar to when I did
[12:58] human rights work or taught or I was
[13:00] training to be a social worker at one
[13:02] point it's very Mission driven what I do
[13:05] I want to defend Bitcoin I want to make
[13:07] sure that and I also want to normalize
[13:09] it I want it to be normal for people to
[13:11] use something like this and for people
[13:12] to have the right to hold on to a money
[13:15] or an asset or to be a part of a network
[13:18] that essentially serves as something of
[13:20] a financial Lifeboat the problem there
[13:23] is that we know that the powers that be
[13:25] around the world not just authoritarian
[13:27] regimes but the powers that around the
[13:29] world they're not going to let that
[13:31] become the new Norm I don't think
[13:33] anytime soon um I know people here in
[13:37] the United States I mean I just met with
[13:39] Trump last week I was the person I don't
[13:41] know if you saw the news with him at
[13:43] pubkey I was the person that interviewed
[13:45] him about Bitcoin at the bar and it was
[13:48] and and he's he's a character but he's
[13:51] there are still people even though he's
[13:53] going to drain the swamp and blah blah
[13:54] blah there are still entrenched
[13:55] interests Jamie Diamond at JP Morgan
[13:58] people are not going to let this sort of
[14:00] stuff happen at least until until
[14:02] they're positioned well enough with the
[14:04] asset until they're holding enough of it
[14:05] or until they're ready for the Paradigm
[14:08] to change um and then the other side of
[14:11] this is that you know you're in Austria
[14:14] I'm in the United States we have pretty
[14:16] decent legal systems um I don't know all
[14:18] the ins and outs of the Austrian legal
[14:20] system but I know it might be better
[14:22] than maybe
[14:24] um let's just say some other countries
[14:26] around the world that maybe are they
[14:28] just don't have has developed of a legal
[14:30] system you know I think that the legal
[14:32] system the fact that here Bitcoin is
[14:34] Free Speech in the United States you
[14:36] know these things are really really
[14:37] important precedents because at the very
[14:39] least it provides some legal protection
[14:41] for people to use this whereas in other
[14:43] countries that might not be the way it's
[14:44] seen or the way it's classified so I
[14:47] think that around the world there's
[14:48] still going to be a lot of work to do um
[14:51] I think what we have to do is just
[14:52] appeal to people in power who get it and
[14:54] I know that that's like you know I'm a
[14:56] statist cuck or whatever because I say
[14:58] this sort of stuff I'm I just believe in
[15:01] Civil Society I learned a lot from
[15:03] activists like Anna covich and ludila
[15:05] klava and uh both jadine at the open
[15:09] dialogue Foundation you know I learned a
[15:11] lot that Civil Society is super
[15:13] important we have to engage with the
[15:14] people in power I'm not saying that
[15:16] government officials aren't corrupt and
[15:18] they're difficult to deal with and the
[15:19] system isn't corrupt it is no question
[15:22] um but the opposite side of that I lived
[15:24] under an authoritarian regime I lived
[15:26] under Chavez I don't want to live under
[15:27] that I don't want to create a scenario
[15:29] where that could become the case in the
[15:31] United States or elsewhere so it's sort
[15:33] of like we have to talk to people and I
[15:36] think there are decent people out there
[15:38] you know there are decent people in
[15:40] government it's not a monolith it's not
[15:42] just this big evil thing that sort of
[15:43] crushes Our Lives you know there's it's
[15:45] people um so to get back to your to your
[15:49] question though I think it will have an
[15:51] incredible impact on human rights I
[15:53] think it's super necessary for human
[15:55] rights the freedom to transact I would
[15:57] say you could argue that it's more
[15:59] important than the freedom of speech
[16:00] because the freedom of speech without
[16:02] the freedom to transact it doesn't you
[16:04] know if you don't have any money you're
[16:06] you could say whatever you want but
[16:07] obviously you can only survive for so
[16:09] long in such a situation so yeah this is
[16:12] the case but you know I'm just hoping
[16:14] that it's going to take I think a lot of
[16:17] people around the world and governments
[16:18] around the world who stand up and say
[16:20] you know this should be something that's
[16:21] normalized people should freely transact
[16:23] with Bitcoin um and I know this might be
[16:26] unpopular in some ways like I I don't
[16:28] think I think in some ways I'm very very
[16:30] grateful to what naib bu has done how he
[16:33] sort of normalized it there's been other
[16:35] sorts of Human Rights issues with him
[16:37] that you know that get me a little bit
[16:39] worried um generally speaking you know
[16:41] I've spoken with the people that work
[16:42] with him I'm happy for the people of El
[16:44] Salvador that they feel safer and all of
[16:46] this stuff and I think that's a huge
[16:47] breakthrough you just sort of you know
[16:49] as power consolidates you just have to
[16:51] be wary of like what happens but yeah to
[16:53] your to your point I think Bitcoin and
[16:55] human rights are inextricably linked
[16:58] yeah it's it's uh El Salvador is
[17:00] fascinating for me because I don't know
[17:02] a lot about politics in El Salvador um
[17:06] but I am I empathized with his situation
[17:09] because he basically ran a country which
[17:12] had a massive problems with murdering
[17:14] and gangs so uh sometimes I think
[17:16] radical situations uh may be justifying
[17:20] as I have no clue about the politics
[17:22] there I can don't even really say
[17:23] something about that but maybe justify a
[17:25] radical reaction to that um but yeah one
[17:29] thing that that you said I think was
[17:31] really interesting with freedom to
[17:33] transact and is more important to
[17:35] freedom of speech I always F in my head
[17:38] freedom to transact is freedom of speech
[17:41] for me as transaction is just a form of
[17:44] communication for me but yeah that's
[17:46] just like how I look at it it's it's
[17:49] it's really interesting how when when
[17:51] you talk about freedom of speech you
[17:53] cannot have freedom of speech if you are
[17:54] not allowed to transact in your way that
[17:58] like that's that's I think that's just
[17:59] not not possible really cool um would
[18:02] you also say that Bitcoin is just the
[18:04] best tool for for human rights in in
[18:07] general or is that too far um I don't
[18:10] think about I try not to think about
[18:12] this stuff in terms of black and white
[18:14] or sort of like um what's the word like
[18:16] classifying it as the best or whatever I
[18:18] think about it just in terms of that it
[18:19] is a tool and it's a very powerful one
[18:21] at that so I think it's it's one of many
[18:24] Tools in an Arsenal um I don't think I I
[18:28] re reject not reject it sounds too
[18:30] strong but I think some of like the
[18:32] catchphrases in Bitcoin like fix the
[18:34] money fix the world and stuff like that
[18:36] they're a little oversimplified while I
[18:38] while I while I do believe that fixing
[18:40] the money would fix a lot of problems I
[18:43] even I almost I'll put it this way I
[18:44] almost reject the term fix the world it
[18:46] just seems very sort of paternalistic
[18:48] like we're going to fix this or blah
[18:50] blah blah I like terms like empowerment
[18:52] I like terms like giving people more
[18:54] options or an alternative Financial
[18:56] system or you know a censorship
[18:57] resistant way to do things I'll give a
[19:00] shout out I think the book resistance
[19:02] money uh written by the The Three
[19:04] Philosophers I think it's uh Andrew
[19:07] Bradley and Craig warmy yeah so the the
[19:10] the book resistance money I think does a
[19:12] really good job of laying out like
[19:14] look we can talk about Bitcoin
[19:16] theoretically is it the best this is it
[19:18] that is it going to bring back like a
[19:20] new I don't know is it going to bring
[19:22] back Renaissance architecture or
[19:23] something like that like we don't really
[19:25] know but we know what it is right now
[19:27] it's a system that people can access if
[19:29] they have an internet connection they
[19:30] can use permissionless and I think
[19:32] inherently this makes it an extremely
[19:34] important tool for human rights
[19:37] absolutely I love that point um this
[19:40] podcast probably comes out before the
[19:42] Bitcoin Amsterdam uh conference uh which
[19:44] I will also be speaking on on a panel
[19:47] and today I had a discussion with one of
[19:49] the speakers um and we discussed like
[19:52] what kind of uh inner topics we should
[19:55] discuss on the panel and one thing that
[19:57] might also be really interesting is what
[20:00] like when we look about the vision for
[20:02] Bitcoin in 2050 what which is the topic
[20:05] of the panel um what Bitcoin doesn't
[20:08] solve like what what what problems will
[20:10] Bitcoin not tackle uh so like I will
[20:13] just give it to you like what do you
[20:15] think when even if we are in a h biton
[20:17] world we maybe even got rid of complete
[20:19] fear like we actually in this dream
[20:21] dystopian Bitcoin world yeah what
[20:24] problems are still there that we might
[20:26] have today um you know there were plenty
[20:29] of things that happened during period
[20:33] there were plenty of bad things that
[20:34] happened during periods where the world
[20:35] had hard money there was slave trade
[20:37] there was still you know bad things
[20:39] going on and as you asked that question
[20:41] one of the things that came to mind at
[20:43] the Bitcoin Nashville conference we were
[20:44] at the live desk with uh with my boss
[20:47] Pete Rizzo and FEI Long from the human
[20:50] rights Foundation I think then he was
[20:51] with be trust
[20:52] Builders yeah he he joined us and we
[20:55] were talking about the US stockpiling
[20:58] Bitcoin treasury Reserve asset all of
[21:00] this stuff and FEI said something like I
[21:02] hope that doesn't happen because then
[21:04] you'll have all the Bitcoin which means
[21:05] you'll have more of the purchasing power
[21:06] and you could sort of still dictate
[21:08] terms for places in Africa Latin America
[21:11] all of this stuff so I think hyper
[21:13] Bitcoins coin IED world you
[21:16] know I think it all sort of it depends
[21:19] how much the everyday person adopts it
[21:21] it depend you know I mean if it's uh
[21:23] huge institutions that sort of Hoover it
[21:25] all up and then have us sort of acting
[21:27] like puppets because they have all the
[21:28] purchase power it's not a great thing um
[21:32] I don't think that's the way it will go
[21:34] but I think the other the deeper thing
[21:36] is that even if you know we have to be
[21:39] people with each other you know we see
[21:41] on Twitter being kind can be difficult
[21:44] right like being human and stuff can be
[21:47] you know can be challenging we're still
[21:49] going to be confronted with treating
[21:52] Each Other Well I think issues of you
[21:54] know we're so I'll put it this way too
[21:56] like we are hardwired to have group and
[21:58] outgroup bias which means you know
[22:01] you're a different gender than me you
[22:03] don't look like me you're a different
[22:04] race from me therefore danger right
[22:06] that's biological so we still have to
[22:09] put in that effort to there's a there's
[22:10] a really great book I'm sorry about the
[22:12] tangent but I think it's important
[22:13] there's a book called uh bowling alone
[22:15] it was written by an anthropologist at
[22:17] Harvard I'm forgetting his name but the
[22:19] point to the book he set out to write a
[22:21] book on diversity and how it's good and
[22:23] what he learned in the book is that
[22:24] diversity is actually not good when
[22:28] people people don't have something else
[22:29] in common but it's good once people have
[22:32] something else in common which is also
[22:33] why I think Bitcoin is a really powerful
[22:35] tool but what he basically said is like
[22:37] look if you have like a diverse
[22:38] neighborhood in the United States and a
[22:40] lot of those people either play on the
[22:42] same softball team or go to the same
[22:44] church and then they see each other as
[22:45] like a teammate or someone that believes
[22:47] in the same religion or that does the
[22:49] same thing they tend to have deeper
[22:51] bonds despite their differences whatever
[22:53] racial differences or ethnicity
[22:55] differences um but when you don't really
[22:58] have that you know they're still sort of
[22:59] like you're over here I'm over here I
[23:01] don't totally trust you it's just part
[23:03] of human nature and I just think I don't
[23:06] I think in some ways you know Bitcoin
[23:08] could be this amazing Force if we if we
[23:09] look at each other people that don't
[23:11] look like us in the Bitcoin space as
[23:13] bitcoiners then it could be a really
[23:15] powerful term right we're we're we're
[23:17] naturally sort of allied with now people
[23:19] in Africa who are fighting for this in
[23:21] Latin America and Southeast Asia I mean
[23:23] you and I are white guys from the West
[23:25] you know what I mean but we're we're
[23:27] part of a movement that includes people
[23:29] from all over the world all genders
[23:31] super diverse um but at the same time
[23:34] when I have certain conversations with
[23:36] people who don't look like me or look
[23:38] like you they do talk about how it's
[23:40] harder to get their voice present in
[23:43] conversations yesterday I taught a class
[23:45] and I'll give a shout out to uh Bitcoin
[23:47] Dada I don't know if you've heard of it
[23:48] but if you have a chance you should have
[23:50] Lorraine Marcel on she's uh the head of
[23:52] a program for African women that teaches
[23:55] them about Bitcoin but also teaches them
[23:57] skills to then get involved in in the
[23:58] Bitcoin industry so I taught a writing
[24:00] class there yesterday and and with what
[24:04] Lorraine had to do she would go to these
[24:06] Bitcoin meetups in Kenya and it was
[24:08] filled with a lot of guys and she said
[24:10] it was like rough you know they were
[24:11] very sort of aggressive like you know
[24:13] defensive about Bitcoin which I get it's
[24:15] like defending the tribe sort of thing
[24:17] but one of her biggest jobs has been
[24:19] making space for African women to have a
[24:22] voice in this space you know like we we
[24:24] still have to do that for each other
[24:26] Bitcoin does not automatically do that
[24:27] for people we still sort of have to be
[24:29] people deal with our biases deal with
[24:32] some of you know the issues that have
[24:35] have challenged Humanity Forever at the
[24:38] same time I think in a world where money
[24:41] retains
[24:42] value people will be a little bit less
[24:45] stressed meaning like you work your job
[24:47] you have your money you have less of a
[24:49] reason to be angry and say oh it's these
[24:52] immigrants stealing my jobs it's this
[24:53] doing this it may alleviate certain
[24:55] other things where I think like in the
[24:57] United States something that you know
[24:59] Trump plays on is sort of like it's like
[25:02] a you know
[25:05] it's there's never a discussion of like
[25:07] the dollar has lost 99% of its
[25:09] purchasing power which is making people
[25:11] depressed and putting them on you know
[25:13] prescription drugs and they you know and
[25:15] the suicide rate is at all-time highs
[25:16] instead it's like it's immigrants
[25:18] stealing your jobs it's this it's easier
[25:20] to play on people's fears when they
[25:21] don't feel secure about their financial
[25:23] future so I think making people feel a
[25:25] bit more secure about their financial
[25:26] future having an asset that holds value
[25:28] over time I think that might help to
[25:30] alleviate some problems or at least I
[25:32] hope it does yeah I hope so too and and
[25:36] it gives us the um importance of having
[25:40] a sound money and having something that
[25:42] we can rely on having a foundation there
[25:44] which also this is a question that ask
[25:46] me a lot like we now in this early
[25:48] Bitcoin Community um there are those big
[25:51] Bitcoin conferences but uh there are not
[25:55] so many people that actually understand
[25:57] Bitcoin I don't know what what the
[25:59] number is like if it's 100,000 or
[26:01] 500,000 that actually understand and
[26:03] have a deep understanding for Bitcoin in
[26:05] the whole world very hard to to say but
[26:08] um we are in a very early community and
[26:12] sometimes I think like the early
[26:14] Community gives an Insight in what the
[26:16] world might look like but maybe also not
[26:18] because we're just in a very early
[26:20] Community where people actually critical
[26:22] think they come early to something they
[26:24] are more Brave than maybe others or uh
[26:27] are are more like to overstep their own
[26:29] ego to actually look deeper onto some so
[26:33] like that I think that's a we should not
[26:36] make the mistakes and look now at the
[26:37] Bitcoin community and think like that
[26:39] will be the Bitcoin World in 50 years I
[26:41] think that that would be a big mistake
[26:45] uh to make but I think there there is
[26:47] some impact if we choose uh better
[26:50] money as you um also brought up Donald
[26:53] Trump and I think I saw an article from
[26:54] you even covering the transaction that
[26:57] he made in the
[26:59] as you also interviewed him how
[27:01] meaningful uh is not the transaction
[27:03] alone but Donald Trump being there might
[27:06] win against camel Harris in the
[27:08] administration there's also Viv grasi
[27:11] RFK really big guys then there are C
[27:14] lumus and other people in Senators that
[27:16] are really big on bitcoin how meaningful
[27:19] is that for Bitcoin that we now have
[27:21] that huge political support uh I think
[27:24] it's I think it's super meaningful and
[27:27] you know from my friends on the left you
[27:28] know I get I get Flack or whatever I
[27:31] don't know if we can curse on here but
[27:33] like you I get like I got you know
[27:35] people were like you know there's some
[27:37] people who are like why are you speaking
[27:38] to him and I'm like it doesn't matter
[27:40] who it was it was the first it was a it
[27:42] was a former US president making the
[27:44] first public Bitcoin transaction that's
[27:46] a historical moment not only that but
[27:48] one of the first things that happened in
[27:50] response to that was that all of my
[27:52] contact a lot of contacts that I have in
[27:54] Latin America and Africa people I've
[27:56] interviewed who run circular economy and
[27:59] and and help onboard people to bitcoin I
[28:02] got I got more messages Pro messages
[28:04] from them than anyone else they were
[28:05] like our president is going to see that
[28:08] and maybe now they're going to be more
[28:09] okay with Bitcoin and that was I was not
[28:11] expecting that at all I was more
[28:13] expecting people to be like you know the
[28:15] people that don't like him to be like
[28:16] why would you even talk to someone like
[28:18] that you know blah blah blah but it the
[28:20] the effect was the opposite I think it
[28:22] was really important I want to give a
[28:23] super shout out I think to to RFK who
[28:26] spoke at the Bitcoin conference in 23
[28:29] and spoke with great Nuance around
[28:31] Bitcoin and the importance of self-
[28:32] custody and things that I think a lot of
[28:34] people like you said maybe those 500,000
[28:36] people who really get it you know really
[28:39] understand and and he understood that
[28:42] importance and and on a certain level
[28:43] I'm very glad he's a part of Trump's
[28:45] team now because I think it's a very I
[28:47] think he's a pretty measured voice and
[28:49] I'm glad that he'll be in Trump's ear
[28:51] especially about this stuff um I think
[28:54] the only thing that's hard traditionally
[28:55] I've been a Democrat I'm I'm sort of a
[28:57] walkway Democrat I've lost faith in I
[28:59] think after what the Democrats did to
[29:01] Bernie Sanders in 2016 I'm not going to
[29:03] get too far into that but it just seems
[29:05] super corrupt even what they did to him
[29:07] in 2020 it was just like okay they're
[29:09] they don't want anything to change like
[29:11] there's nothing here and I think what's
[29:13] interesting about Trump and um you know
[29:18] without uh what's interesting about
[29:20] Trump is
[29:21] that for better or worse we don't really
[29:24] know how things will go things I think
[29:25] have more of a potential to change under
[29:28] Trump if he's elected than they do under
[29:30] Harris the Democrats will sort of want
[29:33] things to be status quo but I I
[29:35] personally am not happy with status quo
[29:37] with Trump things could change now could
[29:39] they change in some ways for the worst
[29:40] like him saying I'm not going to
[29:42] relinquish power sure they could without
[29:44] a doubt um could they change in some
[29:47] ways for the better like him giving
[29:48] power to RFK to say you know what I want
[29:50] to make kids healthier I want to get
[29:52] these toxins out of the food that kids
[29:53] are eating like this is what RFK wants
[29:55] to do now not only that but maybe he'll
[29:57] you know he'll he'll be more in favor of
[30:00] setting a tone that's more Pro Bitcoin
[30:01] and because of that we get better
[30:04] regulation around Bitcoin and then that
[30:06] regulation which most of us know is is
[30:08] going to be copied and pasted and cut up
[30:10] and and countries around the world are
[30:12] going to adopt similar regulation now
[30:14] we've sort of set a tone around the
[30:16] world that like Bitcoin is okay because
[30:18] the United States said so I'm not saying
[30:20] that that's the way we all should react
[30:22] it's just the way that things usually do
[30:23] happen I'm not saying the even that the
[30:25] United States should have that level of
[30:27] influence it just historically has been
[30:29] that way at least in recent history so
[30:31] I'm I'm I'm positive in this regard I
[30:35] think it's really really important that
[30:36] and and shout out to my boss David
[30:38] Bailey for inter for actually like
[30:40] educating Trump and saying like there is
[30:42] a difference between Bitcoin and crypto
[30:45] um I had the chance in Nashville to to
[30:48] interview Trump's son as well Donald
[30:51] Trump Jr he came over to the live desk
[30:54] and we got into what Bitcoin is and why
[30:57] you would want it and what the benefits
[30:58] are and he he mentioned it you know it's
[31:00] it's an antidote to money printing it's
[31:02] uh it's something you would use if you
[31:04] live in authoritarian country these were
[31:06] not these were not talking points of any
[31:08] politician or any member of any
[31:09] politician's family in 2020 in the last
[31:12] us election this was not a thing so
[31:14] we're now moving on to a place where
[31:16] some of that rhetoric is now surfacing
[31:17] in the mainstream and this is this is
[31:20] what I want um I don't want Bitcoin to
[31:23] remain sort of a counterculture
[31:24] phenomenon I want Bitcoin to become
[31:26] normalized and one of the the ways to do
[31:28] this is to get bigger people talking
[31:30] about it so in this regard I think Trump
[31:31] has done it a service I think the the
[31:34] senator lumus is of the world who have a
[31:36] very nuanced view of what Bitcoin is
[31:38] thanks to people like Caitlyn long who's
[31:40] from Wyoming the the CEO of custodia
[31:43] Bank um you know I think that we're now
[31:46] and not only that I spoke with a number
[31:48] of other Republicans the two senators
[31:50] from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn I can't
[31:53] think of the other one's name right now
[31:55] but they they came over to the live desk
[31:56] as well and I was able to speak with
[31:58] them they're talking about the
[32:00] importance of Bitcoin mining mining with
[32:01] nuclear energy the jobs that it'll
[32:03] create and I'm like okay now we're
[32:05] getting somewhere like now we're
[32:06] actually like you know we're we're we're
[32:08] having real conversations I think the
[32:11] only part that's a bit I guess shocking
[32:12] to me like I said traditionally I've
[32:14] been on the left um I'm now probably I
[32:16] would just describe myself as a Centrist
[32:17] and I'm I think I'm a registered
[32:19] independent at this point but um you
[32:22] know it's it's it's sad to me that what
[32:25] seems to have surfaced is like
[32:27] Republicans are like okay we're
[32:28] open-minded to this might create jobs
[32:30] there might be some Financial
[32:31] opportunity here whereas Democrats have
[32:34] remained completely closed off to it you
[32:35] have Elizabeth Warren and other
[32:37] Democrats defending big Banks agreeing
[32:39] with J diamond out of all people in
[32:41] Congressional hearings um while Bitcoin
[32:45] in my very humble opinion is now one of
[32:48] the greatest tools for financial
[32:49] inclusion ever a term that the Democrats
[32:51] love or that the left loves Financial
[32:53] inclusion okay well you now have the
[32:54] best tool for it something that another
[32:56] Democrat said just covered some of the
[32:58] America loves crypto event that the
[33:00] stand with crypto Alliance put together
[33:02] I was in some swing states in the United
[33:04] States places where that might sway the
[33:06] results of the
[33:08] election and I I didn't know I didn't
[33:11] even know this but um it was a former
[33:13] congressman who said there's more people
[33:14] in America that now own crypto than own
[33:18] um uh stocks and I when I thought about
[33:21] it because I think only something like
[33:22] 177% of America owns stocks whereas now
[33:25] you have uh I think 20 something percent
[33:28] owns crypto I'm I'm not saying crypto
[33:31] because I'm a proponent of crypto more
[33:32] broadly that's just what he said I'm
[33:34] hoping that that's mostly Bitcoin but
[33:36] it's um you know it's the conversation
[33:38] is changing and I think that this is
[33:40] super important I I don't think I mean I
[33:42] think the cipher Punk ethos and building
[33:45] and creating censorship resistant tools
[33:46] is really important but as we're seeing
[33:49] with the samurai trial which I've been
[33:50] covering I've been in the I've been in
[33:52] the courthouse for the last three
[33:53] hearings for the samurai trial I've I've
[33:55] met with Kon and William and
[33:58] their lawyers it's great to create tools
[34:01] but the power of the state can still
[34:03] come down on you so we need the state to
[34:05] actually switch it stance on this stuff
[34:07] if we really want to see greater
[34:08] adoption I think if you watch or listen
[34:11] to my podcast on a regular basis I guess
[34:13] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[34:16] the most important step is to keep the
[34:19] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[34:21] wallet my personal recommendation for
[34:23] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[34:26] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[34:28] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[34:31] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[34:34] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[34:37] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[34:41] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[34:44] step is to really level up your
[34:46] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[34:48] have the most secure self custody setup
[34:51] you have to secure your own devices you
[34:54] have to protect your privacy you have to
[34:57] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[35:00] on where you live you even want to have
[35:02] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[35:05] move in case something goes really
[35:07] really wrong and through all those steps

[35:25] have something completely new for you
[35:28] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[35:32] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[35:35] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[35:38] look at that beauty I love it so much
[35:40] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[35:44] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[35:46] way to go out there and show that you
[35:49] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[35:52] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[35:55] dropped a completely new and amazing
[35:58] Genesis edition of their watch
[36:01] collections you have the date of the
[36:03] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[36:06] and of course also the block height and
[36:09] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[36:12] level of detail they put in in this
[36:15] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[36:17] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[36:20] down in the descriptions I love those
[36:23] watches so so much that's why I think
[36:26] it's so wonderful that we don't know who
[36:29] sat Nakamoto is a huge huge feature of
[36:33] of Bitcoin it would be um it might still
[36:36] be um good or might still be successful
[36:39] but it's a huge huge uh thing it's also
[36:42] interesting when you talk about um
[36:44] Harris and Trump it's like uh it's it's
[36:47] fascinating when I see politicians that
[36:49] are in the current Administration I see
[36:50] it in Austria right now with Harris in
[36:53] in America uh and as with Salvador I
[36:56] also don't have a lot clue what's going
[36:58] on with American politics uh but it's
[37:00] interesting for me when Harry says like
[37:02] oh I will do that and do that and I'm
[37:04] like she's the vice president right
[37:07] she she's she she's already there like
[37:10] and she probably can influence TR in a
[37:13] major way so she can she can do things
[37:15] uh same thing in austa when when when
[37:17] the chancellor says like oh I will do
[37:19] that when you elect me I'm like you are
[37:21] a Chancellor you are already eled why
[37:24] not now one thing that um I'm wondering
[37:27] about and a lot of people St that in the
[37:29] comments and I think a lot of people
[37:31] commented that after Trump's speeches
[37:33] like why so much crypto like why is he
[37:37] um always saying like I I think it's
[37:40] great that he is really like making the
[37:42] difference and saying like Bitcoin and
[37:43] crypto or not just saying crypto but
[37:45] like making the difference like that's a
[37:47] huge step uh but especially at the
[37:49] Bitcoin conference it was a little bit
[37:51] like uh I think it would have been so
[37:53] much more positively got by all the
[37:56] people when he just like left out
[37:57] grouped off the whole speech the whole
[37:59] speech would be way more positive he's
[38:02] so he said something to me that day at
[38:04] pubkey and he's on he's
[38:07] such he's like half a comedian half a
[38:11] troll sometimes those things are the
[38:12] same things but I think he honestly does
[38:14] it to just prod people even his support
[38:17] like so he said to me that day he was
[38:19] like I said to him asked him some very
[38:21] basic questions what do you think you
[38:22] know you're in a Bitcoin bar in New York
[38:24] City what do you think oh this place is
[38:25] great I love this place I just paid in
[38:27] Bitcoin blah blah blah and then he he's
[38:29] sort of like going on then he looks at
[38:30] me he's like you know he says something
[38:31] to the effect of like you know what I
[38:33] call people like you I call them crypto
[38:36] maniacs and he does it almost just to
[38:38] like just to sort of like prod you a
[38:41] little bit just to be like let me see
[38:43] what reaction I'm gonna get so I think
[38:45] he almost it's just his personality in a
[38:47] way he's sort of like this could say
[38:50] it's like sort of like a punk rock
[38:52] personality of like he's just going to
[38:53] do that thing that sort of Ruffles
[38:55] feathers even if he's in a group of his
[38:57] support supporters like he's in this
[38:58] Bitcoin at this Bitcoin conference what
[39:00] did he finish that conference with have
[39:02] fun with your Bitcoin and your crypto
[39:04] and whatever else you're playing with
[39:05] like he has to do this like sort of like
[39:08] trollish thing like and I I'm at a point
[39:11] where I'm like I'm indifferent to it I
[39:13] think it's very very good and again like
[39:15] super hat tip to my bosses to to David
[39:18] Bailey to Mike germano for for educating
[39:20] him about the difference um I have a you
[39:24] know the other side of it is that I'm
[39:25] sure he knows there are a lot of people
[39:26] who are just Pro crypto I'm sure he's
[39:28] heard from them as well and he's trying
[39:29] to to reach that audience as well um
[39:32] which I guess from a political strategy
[39:35] standpoint I get it um part of me just
[39:37] thinks like I don't know he's like he's
[39:39] just messing around I don't know what it
[39:40] is um yeah I think a lot of people felt
[39:42] a bit disappointed after that but then
[39:44] on the other hand I think a lot of
[39:47] people you know for as happy as people
[39:50] are that you know Trump is doing what
[39:52] he's doing I think people are still like
[39:54] it's Donald Trump like this is sort of
[39:55] the way he is and it is what it is so
[39:57] yeah I think it Al along the fact that
[40:01] he was there was a huge factor for me
[40:03] yes uh I watched the speech I watched
[40:06] one hour delay of the speech it was
[40:09] hilarious uh but it I think alone that
[40:13] he was there and spoke no matter like
[40:15] people saying oh it was just a campaign
[40:17] thing like yeah of course he wants to
[40:19] win a campaign so like that's that
[40:21] that's normal and that that's
[40:22] understandable but that he actually went
[40:24] there he can he could went anywhere like
[40:26] he has for every evening 5,000 options
[40:29] where he can go so that's a huge thing
[40:31] that he spends his time at a Bitcoin
[40:33] conference y um which is uh really
[40:36] amazing and now I forgot what I wanted
[40:38] to say to that you mind if I comment on
[40:40] that I there's two things that I want
[40:42] people to really understand too one it's
[40:44] amazing that he showed up to you know
[40:46] the Bitcoin event which had 25,000
[40:47] people there but it's even I think it's
[40:49] even and I'm super happy that happened
[40:51] but to show up to pubkey with maybe 45
[40:54] maybe 40 or 50 people in a bar in New
[40:56] York City
[40:58] amazing and I just want everyone to
[41:00] understand this I know this I know the
[41:02] people who organize both events I work
[41:04] for Bitcoin magazine so I obviously know
[41:06] them but I I go to pubkey every Thursday
[41:08] night for meetup so I've been going to
[41:09] pubkey for two years so I know the
[41:11] owners of the bar well the M for all of
[41:13] these
[41:14] events at the same time Trump was
[41:16] invited so was Biden so was Harris we we
[41:20] invited both sides we did not try to
[41:22] make this partisan neither Pub Key nor
[41:25] bit Bitcoin magazine is like a Maga
[41:26] Outlet that's not the that's not what
[41:29] this is we invited both sides not only
[41:32] with pubkey they invited Trump they
[41:35] invited they invited Harris Biden then
[41:38] they invited our two senators Chuck
[41:40] Schumer Christen gbrand they invited
[41:42] even you know people who were lower than
[41:44] obviously presidents or presidential
[41:45] candidates or vice presidents or
[41:46] whatever the only people who even
[41:48] responded were I think VI they invited
[41:50] VC as well he responded and said he
[41:52] couldn't make it and then Trump said he
[41:53] could so when people say well it's just
[41:56] a campaign thing yeah I get that and
[41:58] like you just said but that's how
[41:59] representative democracy Works people
[42:01] speak up they say this is important to
[42:03] us the politician reacts to that I don't
[42:06] have a problem with that you know what I
[42:07] mean it's like this is how it works like
[42:09] we have made this a campaign issue it's
[42:12] important to a lot of Americans it's
[42:13] important to a lot of people globally
[42:15] it's now an issue one side is addressing
[42:17] that the other side is just keeps
[42:19] thinking that they don't have to like
[42:20] that they're better than it and and
[42:21] that's unfortunately Harris's side she I
[42:23] think she just thought she could sort of
[42:25] sidestep this or she was just of waiting
[42:27] to see like do that many people care
[42:30] they do you know and I think people now
[42:32] whenever you see something about her
[42:34] posted on Twitter you just see all the
[42:35] comments are like oh it's just more
[42:37] empty rhetoric more empty rhetoric more
[42:38] empty rhetoric you know and that's
[42:40] that's a tough corner to get out of
[42:42] especially when you've been vice
[42:43] president under an Administration that's
[42:44] been super hostile to bitcoin and to
[42:46] crypto more broadly yeah it's it's a
[42:49] it's a great point also to that point
[42:52] where where we talking about the Bitcoin
[42:53] transaction in in the bar how important
[42:56] in general do we think is it that we
[42:59] spend our Bitcoin that we fire up those
[43:01] uh uh circular economies it's it's like
[43:04] sometimes hard because you have capital
[43:05] gains and and all those hurdles and it's
[43:07] not accepted uh everywhere but how
[43:10] important is that for the adoption right
[43:11] now I think it's huge and something that
[43:15] most people don't know but I'm a huge
[43:17] proponent of and I'll give a shout out
[43:18] to Kristen gilbran who's the senator in
[43:20] my state of New York and to Cynthia
[43:22] lumus they put forth a bill I think it
[43:24] was a year or two ago saying that all
[43:26] transactions under $2,000 wouldn't be
[43:28] subject to capital gains tax this is
[43:30] progress in my opinion and because I
[43:32] think that even I I transact with people
[43:35] in the circular economies frequently
[43:36] yesterday I bought a book at a human
[43:38] rights Foundation sponsored event paid
[43:40] paid with it for Bitcoin that was $30
[43:42] sometimes I give a donation that's $100
[43:45] all of those things that's just my money
[43:47] me spending it the way that I want to
[43:49] and it's going to people causes
[43:51] circumstances places where I want it to
[43:53] go to I don't want to have to account
[43:56] for that you know I don't want to and I
[43:58] don't think it's fair to and I and even
[44:00] politicians that I've spoken with in the
[44:02] United States have said like it's you
[44:04] know if one side if you're going to
[44:06] abuse the money so badly don't be upset
[44:09] if people start using a different money
[44:11] if you're going to abuse the dollar and
[44:12] print it to such and this is politicians
[44:14] saying this so it's like I I I truly
[44:17] believe that the whole what people often
[44:19] say you know there is no store of value
[44:21] without medium of exchange and vice
[44:23] versa there's no medium of exchange
[44:24] without store of value I think it's very
[44:27] necessary that we start normalizing
[44:29] spending Bitcoin the problem with that
[44:31] is that it's relatively difficult um
[44:34] I'll shout out to proton wallet for for
[44:36] creating uh proton mail for creating
[44:38] proton wallet they have a 100 million
[44:40] users using proton mail so now making it
[44:43] really easy for people to open up a
[44:44] wallet and to send Bitcoin via email
[44:46] addresses super super cool that's
[44:49] progress but I think the bigger issues
[44:51] are like lightning especially
[44:53] non-custodial lightning is really
[44:55] difficult to use um custodia lightning I
[44:57] think is good and I don't I'm not a
[44:59] purist in that sense I don't you know I
[45:01] think blink wallet is a cool wallet and
[45:03] there's a lot of cool things with
[45:04] custodial lightning I just wouldn't
[45:05] leave a lot of my money in a custodial
[45:07] lightning scenario um but to your point
[45:10] I think people need to normalize
[45:11] spending Bitcoin the whole just like
[45:14] hotle forever and this and that if
[45:17] that's what you want to do that's fine
[45:18] there's no judgment but I do think that
[45:21] you know right now 94% of the Bitcoin is
[45:24] mined and like 3% of the world actually
[45:27] has any Bitcoin those numbers are not
[45:29] going to add up if you want
[45:30] hyperbitcoinization it can't continue to
[45:33] be like that having a small group of
[45:34] people basically own all of it none of
[45:37] it really being used as a medium of
[45:39] exchange like we need to change that
[45:41] Dynamic it's also interesting with with
[45:44] lightning um I personally mostly use a
[45:48] wallet of Satoshi which is fully uh
[45:51] custodial so it's it's for me such a
[45:55] small amount where I'm like like the
[45:57] most I ever have on there like 50 there
[46:00] you go yeah if even if I lose it it's
[46:04] like losing your wallet you take your
[46:06] wallet also with you uh and that's
[46:08] that's the same thing I I don't really
[46:10] care if if that is lost if there would
[46:13] be I don't know uh 10,000 on there or
[46:16] over a thousand or something like that
[46:18] that's an amount where you should
[46:19] actually care about and not leave it on
[46:21] a hot wallet where it's it's it's
[46:24] custodial and if you lose the phone or
[46:26] you leave if you lose access to your
[46:27] email address or they can just take it
[46:29] away from you yeah but if it's if it's
[46:32] just something that you pay or a
[46:34] restaurant bill with or you pay in a bar
[46:36] like that does not matter yeah agreed
[46:39] agree so um also to the point do you see
[46:42] that lightning kind of already won as a
[46:44] layer to or do you see other
[46:46] developments in in that regard yeah I
[46:48] think I think lightning I'll change the
[46:51] term I think to to answer shortly yes I
[46:54] think lightning has very much won um but
[46:57] I think part of the reason for that is
[46:58] because it will end up just being um not
[47:00] only a layer two in and of itself but a
[47:03] glue between other layer TW so it'll be
[47:05] something between liquid side chain and
[47:08] something like botanics which the spider
[47:10] chain you know a Bitcoin layer 2 that's
[47:12] coming out in the other Bitcoin layer
[47:13] twos that exist so I think lightning is
[47:15] this amazing transactional layer glue
[47:18] and so it's uh it's it's uh you know
[47:22] it's it's proven to work well enough I'm
[47:26] I'm not you know I know it's not perfect
[47:28] I know it's not super easy but I also
[47:29] think it's an amazing advancement for
[47:31] Bitcoin and you know it'll get better
[47:33] over time um and I
[47:37] think when you see the likes of a
[47:39] company like light spark which has
[47:42] raised literally hundreds of millions of
[47:44] dollars Now using lightning as their
[47:46] payments layer you know you can have
[47:48] your feelings on light spark and what
[47:50] they stand for how they operate
[47:52] whatever but I mean you can't that's if
[47:55] you just look at it from a market
[47:57] standpoint it's a huge you know this is
[47:59] a massive massive
[48:01] massive adoption so it's you know I
[48:04] think it's happening um one of the
[48:06] things I think a lot about with
[48:07] lightning uh Alex lman the CEO of river
[48:11] um said that lightning right now is sort
[48:13] of a great it's a great option for
[48:16] transferring Bitcoin between uh
[48:18] custodial Services custodial lightning
[48:20] like River offers a custodial lightning
[48:21] version you have strike you have wallet
[48:23] of Satoshi you have blink and I think
[48:25] that that right now is best way to use
[48:27] it it will we will have to make changes
[48:30] to it because once the base chain
[48:32] becomes really really expensive to use
[48:35] not you know forget about like opening
[48:37] up channels and blah blah blah even just
[48:39] moving money from the base chain to
[48:40] lightning like you just said if you're
[48:42] gonna have to move if you only really
[48:44] want to move 50 or $100 doll or Euros
[48:46] worth of bitcoin at a time you're not
[48:48] going to want to pay that archain
[48:50] transaction to Move It from your cold
[48:51] wallet or something like that so it's a
[48:54] we're going to have to make it better
[48:56] have to be advancements but I think
[48:58] that's one of the beautiful things about
[49:00] this space is
[49:01] that to speculate and say like lightning
[49:04] will work or won't work it's ridiculous
[49:06] because there are so many Brilliant
[49:08] Minds in this space working on
[49:09] open-source software coming up with
[49:11] solutions that nobody could have ever
[49:13] envisioned five six years ago so yeah I
[49:16] think lightning continues to be the sort
[49:18] of transactional layer for Bitcoin and
[49:20] the glue between all the other layer
[49:21] twos and sort of solutions that come out
[49:24] absolutely I think uh that's all was uh
[49:27] my Cod to answer also like um there are
[49:30] so many Pride Minds in that space so
[49:32] many great innovators entrepreneurs um
[49:35] we will figure out how to make a payment
[49:38] rate I'm 100% certain that we will
[49:41] figure that out H and to a certain
[49:43] extent it already works like I already
[49:45] at my local Bitcoin Meetup last time I
[49:48] paid with Sates I paid with lightning
[49:50] that that it was way easier than paying
[49:53] with a credit card it's it's better than
[49:56] Apple pay already so in certain
[49:59] scenarios but of course there will come
[50:01] challenges along the way uh also like
[50:05] except for sponsorships Bitcoin and uh
[50:08] one company coin vigilante uh they are
[50:11] based in America and we first wanted to
[50:14] figure out how to do the Fiat payment
[50:15] and then we like ah let's let's do it in
[50:17] Bitcoin we did it on a Sunday uh
[50:19] afternoon uh from America to Austria and
[50:22] it was done in minutes now I had the
[50:25] confirmation that would have so
[50:27] complicated in the Fiat world so like
[50:29] having one standard based protocol money
[50:33] it's a game changer and I feel like not
[50:36] not many are talking about like that uh
[50:40] advantage that have one layer one
[50:42] protocol one language like English to
[50:46] have as a base layer where everyone all
[50:47] of the sudden can uh communicate with
[50:49] each other it's it's it's fascinating
[50:51] you'll see yep Agreed 100% yeah really
[50:55] cool I have two more fun question before
[50:58] we come to the end routine um what do
[51:00] you think happens when AI uh is getting
[51:04] to know about Bitcoin and they using uh
[51:07] different Eis using Bitcoin to uh send
[51:11] satoshis to each other yeah um yeah I
[51:14] think that's probably when people talk
[51:16] about hyperbitcoinization that's
[51:18] probably when things get
[51:20] really insane in terms of adoption and a
[51:24] system using it I think my biggest
[51:26] thought with that is I truly truly truly
[51:29] hope that it becomes Bitcoin that that
[51:32] it adopts I think the other day coinbase
[51:34] was messing around with AI and using
[51:36] like usdc and I'm like no we need an
[51:39] internet native money for this we don't
[51:41] need a money that's backed up by the
[51:42] traditional Finance system that AI is
[51:44] using like and I think whereas I used to
[51:47] think it was sort of inevitable that it
[51:49] will be Bitcoin I now sort of think
[51:51] we're going to need to push for it to be
[51:52] Bitcoin so but when that does happen
[51:55] yeah I think that's probably
[51:57] your quickest route to
[51:58] hyperbitcoinization because if AI is
[52:01] just using it to transact and there's no
[52:05] converting it back to Fiat or anything
[52:07] else it's just becoming part of a system
[52:10] the same way it is in circular economies
[52:12] or whatever else but with AI on a much
[52:14] bigger scale that causes now there's
[52:16] more adoption the price if it goes up
[52:18] and we all know like when the price goes
[52:19] up that's what really attracts newbies
[52:21] into the space so yeah I think that that
[52:23] effect will just compound and compound
[52:25] and compound the more AI adopts it uh
[52:28] 100% the price is definitely the number
[52:32] one marketing marketing tool still it's
[52:35] it's undeniable the data it's so funny
[52:38] because I make thumbnails I make titles
[52:41] uh and I said before I collect data from
[52:43] that H and people some sometimes say
[52:45] like oh you're making a lot of videos
[52:47] around the price and I'm like no I don't
[52:49] do like it's it's like maybe once every
[52:51] two weeks or something like that it's
[52:53] like one 10% maybe of my videos but the
[52:56] thing that happens is all the videos
[52:59] that have a price Target have something
[53:01] with price related or numbers related in
[53:03] the title of thumbnail they got shoot up
[53:05] in the few ranks totally uh and if you
[53:07] look at my latest videos they're like
[53:09] mixed and then you switch to popular all
[53:12] of a all other vide is is high up so
[53:15] like it's undeniable the number one uh
[53:18] uh marketing Tool uh one other fun sorry
[53:21] you want to say something about no I
[53:23] agree I think people who think opposite
[53:26] one you're denying data like you just
[53:28] said and two like I it's not it was um
[53:32] Hermon from Bitcoin nassi said like of
[53:34] course the price is important like it
[53:36] the thesis doesn't play out because
[53:38] essentially think about it like the way
[53:39] Jeff Booth talks about it which is that
[53:41] Bitcoin is not going up in price
[53:43] everything is falling in price against
[53:45] Bitcoin so like when you think about it
[53:47] like that the cost of a house is getting
[53:48] cheaper takes more dollars to buy one
[53:51] Bitcoin that's part of the Bitcoin
[53:53] thesis that it is the perfect
[53:55] denominator right that it's the perfect
[53:57] you know um it's the perfect unit you
[54:00] would use to economize because it's a
[54:01] stable amount so it's a set amount so I
[54:04] think talking about price is super
[54:06] important and even when it comes to
[54:08] people seeing p i mean that's what first
[54:11] attracted me when it came to like I
[54:12] understood all the tech and I was sort
[54:14] of like because of my experience was
[54:15] like oh I see what this could do but I
[54:17] was also in student loan debt and didn't
[54:19] want to be in it anymore so it's like
[54:21] you know there's very I think there's
[54:23] very few of us out there that are just
[54:24] like so financially comfortable that the
[54:27] idea of holding an asset that goes up in
[54:29] price a lot isn't appealing to so it's
[54:32] fine I think I think the magic and based
[54:34] on what you just said even just in terms
[54:36] of the statistics of how many videos you
[54:38] make about price I think our work is to
[54:40] sort of you meet people where they're at
[54:42] we can call that just the price and then
[54:44] you get them in with the price and then
[54:46] you start doing the work to explain to
[54:47] them what this thing is and all that
[54:49] stuff so I don't think we should ignore
[54:51] price I don't think it's like a bad
[54:52] thing to touch base on it just we don't
[54:54] want to just sort of stop there we don't
[54:55] want to jum tell people about the price
[54:57] and then sort of not explain some of the
[54:59] philosophy or the technology
[55:01] Etc it's a it's a scoreboard uh how fast
[55:05] US Dollars and fear currencies are
[55:07] falling and and collapsing I think
[55:09] that's that's the best way to look at it
[55:11] uh really cool one uh the second fun
[55:13] question um if Bitcoin would have been
[55:17] discovered 50 years ago uh and it would
[55:19] have been successful how different uh do
[55:22] you think the world would be
[55:24] now that's a great question um there's
[55:27] so many factors that make that so
[55:29] difficult I think that's a really good
[55:31] question um it's very difficult to
[55:34] predict that obviously because 50 years
[55:35] ago like we we sort of barely had
[55:37] computers so it's hard to conceptualize
[55:40] that but let's just say that we did have
[55:42] some way
[55:44] to uh let's say transact with gold more
[55:46] easily so if we started transacting with
[55:48] gold something that essentially holds
[55:50] value um I think the world would be much
[55:53] better off I think I'm 42 what I've seen
[55:56] in my generation I was born in 1982
[55:59] which was 11 years after Nixon took the
[56:01] United States off the gold standard and
[56:03] Fiat became sort of a thing
[56:05] globally is you know my parents bought
[56:08] right before I was born bought a house
[56:10] for $50,000 if I had to guess that house
[56:13] is probably on the market now if they
[56:15] were to sell it like I mean we don't
[56:17] live in that house anymore but I would
[56:18] imagine if someone put that house up for
[56:20] sale it cost at least
[56:22] $650,000 that is insane that is insane
[56:25] you know because there's no everything
[56:28] else has not gone up that much um
[56:30] salaries have not gone up that much you
[56:32] know all of this stuff has not
[56:33] correlated I think the biggest thing
[56:35] though is that you know what my gut
[56:37] tells me I'm not super
[56:39] hopeful the world would be much
[56:41] different but I am hopeful in the sense
[56:43] that I think those who are curious and
[56:46] who are like why isn't this working why
[56:47] isn't why am I why is my job not enough
[56:49] for me to buy a house why is blah blah
[56:51] blah my salary I think those curious
[56:53] people like you and I who have you know
[56:55] delved into the Bitcoin would have
[56:58] figured it out well let's just call it
[57:00] like digital gold existed or whatever it
[57:02] was that we could transact with and said
[57:04] okay I'm just going to move over to this
[57:05] system now and I think that that would
[57:07] have been a life ref for the people that
[57:09] wanted to use it and didn't feel like it
[57:11] was a scam Etc
[57:14] um I think about this a lot like this I
[57:17] was a teacher for 12 years and you never
[57:20] reach all of the students in the class
[57:21] you want to I wanted to and I always
[57:23] felt sort of guilty when I didn't but
[57:25] it's just sort of fact that you just
[57:27] don't reach all of them but you do reach
[57:28] at least a handful and and and those
[57:30] lives will change I think Humanity sort
[57:32] of operates in a similar way like when
[57:34] you really think about like look at
[57:36] Venezuela if
[57:37] Venezuela if
[57:39] Venezuela you know as things were
[57:41] falling apart you know why didn't they
[57:43] adopt Bitcoin more quickly you know why
[57:45] didn't they adopt something that would
[57:46] have helped them weather the storm more
[57:47] quickly I just think sometimes people
[57:50] don't have the knowledge or the
[57:51] motivation or even sort of the emotional
[57:52] effort there may be in a state of trauma
[57:54] or some sort of shock based on what
[57:56] going on around them and they don't have
[57:58] the ability to do that um so on so to to
[58:01] answer your question though I don't
[58:03] think I don't think the world would have
[58:05] changed radically for everyone people
[58:07] may have just accepted the status quo
[58:09] the dollar whatever but I think it would
[58:11] it would have changed a lot for a lot of
[58:13] people the ones who were curious enough
[58:15] or even the ones who are in enough pain
[58:17] to say I have to switch to a different
[58:18] system at this point because this isn't
[58:20] working for
[58:21] me I also think it would have been um a
[58:26] great thing to to already have but yeah
[58:28] I think now we're ready for for Bitcoin
[58:30] as the as you said like 50 years ago the
[58:32] infrastructure was not even really there
[58:35] perfect then we have tin in the podcast
[58:37] where we have two questions the first
[58:38] question is the same for every guest uh
[58:40] what can we learn from you besides
[58:42] Bitcoin I mean technically I was a a
[58:45] language teacher for 12 years so if you
[58:47] need to learn English you could learn
[58:48] that from me but um what could you learn
[58:51] from me um I would need some some
[58:53] English yeah no your English is great
[58:56] yeah um what can you learn from me I
[58:58] don't know I mean I think I actually I
[59:00] wanted there's a person that comes to
[59:02] mind when you ask me this question I
[59:04] mean my first thought was like try
[59:05] harder to be kind and understanding to
[59:07] put yourself into other people's shoes
[59:09] um maybe you know before you post that
[59:12] really mean thing online which I've done
[59:15] uh you know wait 30 seconds and think
[59:16] like do I really need to do this or
[59:18] something like that but I would say the
[59:19] person who actually makes I think of her
[59:22] all the time when I want to say
[59:24] something mean is a girl a woman named
[59:26] Rena Chas and she's she's the head of
[59:28] education for me Premier Bitcoin and
[59:30] she's just one of the nicest human
[59:31] beings on planet Earth and you know it's
[59:34] like I try to I try to think like what
[59:37] would Raina do so for me I I'll relay
[59:39] what I've learned from her and it's just
[59:41] try to like be a bit more Kinder tried
[59:43] to accept that we don't need to add fuel
[59:45] to the fire of animosity and antagonism
[59:48] and this is stuff that I've struggled
[59:49] with and just you know take a breath
[59:51] before uh before acting sometimes in an
[59:54] irrational manner and it's a great point
[59:57] I think that that's not discussed well
[59:59] enough because when you see Bitcoin
[60:02] Twitter it's very different to being in
[60:06] a real world Bitcoin conference Meetup
[60:09] whatever people are more prone to having
[60:13] a weird or aggressive or offensive
[60:16] reaction on online on Twitter especially
[60:20] on Twitter uh versus when you actually
[60:22] meet them uh offline on when you meet
[60:26] for like a drink or something like that
[60:27] they're way more calm way more
[60:30] reasonable so that's always like um I
[60:34] really always try to push people towards
[60:38] meet people in person however you want
[60:41] to do that if you don't have the luxury
[60:44] to be able to go to a Bitcoin conference
[60:47] uh maybe find a local Meetup maybe find
[60:50] just like there's orange pill up there's
[60:52] so many possibilities you can find uh
[60:54] Bitcoin is in your area of of course uh
[60:56] Bitcoin Amsterdam and all those great
[60:59] Bitcoin conf all around the world are
[61:02] amazing as you have so many bitcoiners
[61:04] in in one place yeah um and they are
[61:08] they're great to do that but go find
[61:10] people in the real world that are also
[61:13] bitcoiners I think that's that's the
[61:14] that's the main thing uh and if you come
[61:17] to bitcoin Amsterdam uh it's it would be
[61:20] a pleasure to to meet all of all of you
[61:22] in the audience it's such a it's such an
[61:24] amazing point to to meet people
[61:26] yeah also on that note if you haven't
[61:28] bought tickets yet and I don't know if
[61:30] you have a code but I'll just show mine
[61:31] quickly my code is uh Frank the tank
[61:34] from old school if you've ever seen the
[61:35] movie so uh if you use Frank the Tank
[61:37] you can get 10% off your Amsterdam
[61:39] tickets um I think I just got word
[61:41] yesterday I'll be uh hosting the live
[61:43] desk uh this year and I'll be doing two
[61:46] panels there I'll be doing a panel with
[61:47] uh Founders including Julian liner from
[61:51] reli I'm not sure who the representative
[61:53] from bit refill will and then someone
[61:54] from vexel and I'll be doing a fireside
[61:57] chat with Maya Paro who's running for
[61:59] president of suram right now so yeah
[62:02] please come out and please if you see me
[62:03] walking around and you're there please
[62:05] introduce yourself I'd love to to talk
[62:07] absolutely yeah Maya is amazing I had a
[62:09] podcast with her I probably will do a
[62:11] second round with her either later this
[62:13] year or next year and Julian is also
[62:15] amazing they're amazing people really
[62:17] cool perfect then yeah let's come to the
[62:19] end we the previous guest is asking a
[62:21] question for the next uh next guest
[62:23] without knowing who the next guest is
[62:24] probably the last question
[62:28] um and and the previous guest asked you
[62:31] the question uh what is the most
[62:32] unexpected way you have seen Bitcoin
[62:35] impacting someone's
[62:37] life oh I can answer that immediately uh
[62:41] there's a there's a gentleman named
[62:42] luthando nabami and he is the head of
[62:45] Community Development for Bitcoin aasi
[62:47] which is a Bitcoin circular economy in
[62:49] masle Bay South Africa and I interviewed
[62:52] him for my podcast I was I used to have
[62:54] a podcast called new Renaissance Capital
[62:56] where I focused on interviewing people
[62:58] from Africa Latin America southeast Asia
[63:02] um luthando talked to me when he spoke
[63:05] with me he he never had a bank account
[63:07] he used to save cash and he you know it
[63:09] would constantly lose money or he' get
[63:11] robbed people would come in and Rob his
[63:13] house but having Bitcoin as a saving
[63:15] technology changed his life in the way
[63:17] that he's now more hopeful for the
[63:18] future he he literally stop drinking he
[63:21] doesn't go out to like you know a club
[63:23] and waste money um and he talks he talks
[63:25] about spending more time with his
[63:26] significant other and his child um and
[63:29] he said that this because of the hope
[63:31] that Bitcoin gave him the fact that he
[63:33] can look into the future and believe
[63:34] that it will get better because of
[63:36] Bitcoin he has made very deep personal
[63:38] changes in his life that was actually
[63:40] the moment where I knew that I was on
[63:42] the right path in life and that I was
[63:44] very honored to be what doing what I was
[63:46] doing speaking with people like him oh
[63:49] really cool that that's a that's amazing
[63:51] amazing story um before I let you go
[63:54] where can people find you ask a question
[63:55] questions and and reach out to you yeah
[63:57] actually I'll I'll give you my question
[63:59] as well the uh for the next guest
[64:02] um I I mentioned it earlier how there's
[64:05] a lot of big phrases in Bitcoin fix the
[64:07] money fix the world whatever I would
[64:09] like I would like to ask the next guest
[64:12] to add some Nuance to one of those
[64:13] phrases so for example does fixing the
[64:16] money really completely fix the world um
[64:18] you know any any of the main phrases in
[64:20] Bitcoin to sort of say like okay there's
[64:22] some truth to that but maybe add a
[64:23] little bit of nuance to it so it's a
[64:25] little bit less of a question and more
[64:26] of a request if that's okay that's a I
[64:29] love that does fixing the money really
[64:31] fix the world yeah or just ask it like
[64:34] that yeah really yeah uh where can you
[64:37] find me um you can find me a bunch of
[64:40] different places on Twitter at Frank
