[00:00] if you lose your Hardware wallet you
[00:01] lose your computer you don't have the
[00:03] advisor anymore can you recover your
[00:05] Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only asset you
[00:07] can truly own if you memorize your seed
[00:09] phrase you can own your Bitcoin in your
[00:10] head I can flee my country tomorrow I
[00:12] could hop on a plane and take my entire
[00:14] Bitcoin stack with me can't take a house
[00:16] with me I can't take South African
[00:18] stocks with me or bonds can't take a
[00:20] kilogram of gold when you trust an
[00:22] exchange to hold your Bitcoin it's not
[00:25] yours history is full of breaches of
[00:27] that trust Bitcoin is freedom money and
[00:29] freedom money comes with with
[00:30] responsibility and I think that there's
[00:31] nothing more you can do than just put in
[00:33] the hours to understand what you're
[00:34] doing the more Bitcoin you have the
[00:36] higher security level you need secure
[00:37] your Bitcoin in the best way before you
[00:40] get hilariously rap secure your Bitcoin
[00:42] as if it were worth 10x the current
[00:44] value you don't want to make your
[00:45] Bitcoin set up too complex because
[00:47] you're going to lose Bitcoin to use
[00:49] error rather than an attacker you need
[00:51] to definitely understand what you're
[00:52] doing yourself cuz even if somebody does
[00:54] advise you through it all and you don't
[00:55] really know what you're doing and it's
[00:56] not a good idea bit box cold card
[00:58] treaser are all Prett battle tested the
[01:00] more utxos have the more expensive your
[01:03] Bitcoin transactions are the solution is
[01:05] to combine your utxos together to create
[01:08] larger utxo and have fewer of
[01:11] [Music]
[01:15] them it's really important today that we
[01:18] talk about self- custody as I mentioned
[01:20] before to you uh if everything goes to
[01:23] according to plan I think a lot of new
[01:24] people will join within the next like 12
[01:27] to 18 months and I see a big big risk
[01:30] actually in people coming into the space
[01:33] and saying okay um I want Bitcoin I see
[01:37] the value of Bitcoin they maybe even
[01:39] study a lot of like uh oh why Bitcoin
[01:42] why it's important but then they go
[01:44] ahead and like oh yeah I I downloaded
[01:46] this Bitcoin exchange and I have it
[01:49] there and that's it like now I'm part of
[01:51] Bitcoin or even worse they have some new
[01:54] bank app where they can they cannot even
[01:57] withdraw the Bitcoin I saw that in
[01:58] Austria with like uh already some
[02:01] friends of mine um who said like oh yeah
[02:04] I bought Bitcoin and then I was like oh
[02:06] where where do you have it and then like
[02:08] oh this bank and I was like really you
[02:10] don't even you cannot even withraw the
[02:12] Bitcoin you don't even have the option
[02:13] to S custody there so um maybe to start
[02:17] off with what is your personal
[02:20] motivation uh why are you doing the
[02:23] hustle of studying about self custody
[02:26] and the hustle of self custody
[02:28] itself yeah well I think Bitcoin is the
[02:30] only asset you can truly own if you
[02:32] memorize your seed phrase you can own
[02:34] your Bitcoin in your head I can flee my
[02:36] country tomorrow I could hop on a plane
[02:38] and take my entire Bitcoin stack with me
[02:40] I can't take a house with me I can't
[02:42] take South African stocks with me or
[02:44] bonds or I can't take a kilogram of gold
[02:47] but my Bitcoin is it's very
[02:49] transportable and easy to take so
[02:51] Bitcoin is the only asset you can truly
[02:53] own there's a quote from was it from
[02:56] 1984 where it says the only thing you
[02:59] truly own is the the square inches in
[03:02] your brain something like that along
[03:04] those lines and to me that's like um
[03:06] Bitcoin you you can own it in your head
[03:09] and you can you can go anywhere with it
[03:11] so I think self custody is important
[03:13] because if you're not self-clustering
[03:14] your Bitcoin you don't have that
[03:15] property of Bitcoin you you can't escape
[03:18] with it if it's in locked up in some
[03:20] South African exchange or wherever you
[03:21] live I in South Africa and you you flee
[03:24] the country things go bad and perhaps
[03:26] they don't allow you to withdraw anymore
[03:28] perhaps you can't convert that to
[03:30] whatever you may need and uh they stop
[03:33] you from withdrawing Bitcoin so yeah
[03:35] mainly because Bitcoin is the only asset
[03:37] you truly own is why I'm so big on self
[03:40] custody really cool I I love that reason
[03:44] um I I just want to play a little bit
[03:45] devil's advocate here because I think a
[03:47] lot of people um maybe not everywhere in
[03:51] the world but in privileged countries
[03:53] like I'm in Austria maybe also in
[03:55] America um uh I mean a lot of bitcoiners
[03:59] like hardore bitcoiners don't trust the
[04:01] government but there are a lot of
[04:03] bitcoiners out there that are not in the
[04:05] Bitcoin Twitter Bitcoin podcast bubble
[04:08] but they still have Bitcoin and they
[04:11] trust their government they they trust
[04:13] in institutional things and they often
[04:16] don't trust in
[04:18] themselves and they trust more in like a
[04:21] big exchange who has a big big name um
[04:25] if someone is like in a in a county
[04:27] where everything goes according to Black
[04:30] and they for them it's not a reason to
[04:33] uh be like um like the government is is
[04:36] corrupt or like the there's something
[04:38] really going wrong in the country and
[04:40] they have to flee like within a war
[04:41] scenario what other reasons are there to
[04:44] like why of custody uh with like it's
[04:48] easier to steal in in in exchanges and
[04:50] stuff like that do you have other
[04:52] motivations why people should do that
[04:55] yeah so one of the most famous Satoshi
[04:59] quotes is that history is full of
[05:01] breaches of that trust and I think he's
[05:03] referring to Banks um inflating the the
[05:06] currency Supply and I think that applies
[05:08] to bitcoin as well when you trust a
[05:10] custodian with your Bitcoin you they
[05:13] hold your coins for you it's not truly
[05:15] your your Bitcoin it's an IOU and you're
[05:18] trusting them but history again is full
[05:20] of breaches of that trust when you're
[05:21] trusting a centralized party to do
[05:23] anything for you um they tend to breach
[05:26] that trust and and Bitcoin is a a good
[05:28] example of that so there's been lots of
[05:31] examples of exchanges going bankrupt and
[05:33] running away with Bitcoin FTX is
[05:35] probably the the biggest example I think
[05:37] there was $8 billion lost on FTX and
[05:40] yeah people trusted FTX it was a huge
[05:42] name they had the stadiums they had the
[05:44] huge marketing spend it was very trusted
[05:47] and yeah history is full of breaches of
[05:49] that trust and FX went bankrupt and
[05:51] everyone's Bitcoin was um essentially
[05:53] gone overnight another good example is
[05:56] there was this exchange quadriga x a
[05:59] Canadian exchange and the the founder of
[06:02] that exchange or the person who held the
[06:03] keys that accessed that Bitcoin for that
[06:06] exchange just also mysteriously died I
[06:08] believe he was in India one day he
[06:10] vanished um his one of his family
[06:12] members said he was he died and he was
[06:15] the only one who could spend that
[06:16] Bitcoin and I think a few million
[06:17] dollars in Bitcoin was lost just because
[06:20] that guy vanished so when you trust an
[06:23] exchange to hold your Bitcoin it's not
[06:27] yours and uh another big problem is that
[06:29] these exchanges are huge honeypots they
[06:31] hold lots of Bitcoin so an attacker or
[06:34] or a yeah a sophisticated attacker would
[06:37] rather attack an exchange to get
[06:39] thousands of coins than an individual to
[06:40] get maybe 0 five Bitcoin they're huge
[06:43] honeypots and yeah that's that's one of
[06:46] the big reasons as well is exchanges uh
[06:48] cannot really be
[06:50] trusted um are there other reasons yes
[06:54] if you trust an exchange with your
[06:56] Bitcoin they might be selling paper
[06:57] Bitcoin and therefore increase you know
[06:59] the supply of Bitcoin selling coins that
[07:01] don't exist so if you're a strong
[07:04] proponent for Bitcoin perhaps you would
[07:06] want to self custody a coins so
[07:07] exchanges aren't selling coins that
[07:09] don't exist they're not um uh using your
[07:12] coins and I mean lending out your coins
[07:15] to other people and increasing the
[07:17] supply in turn absolutely I mean it's
[07:20] that's the whole whole point of of
[07:22] Bitcoin I feel like and I hope that the
[07:25] more people own Bitcoin the more they
[07:27] also go down the education part and then
[07:29] they at some point realize oh yeah
[07:32] like I have to own Bitcoin myself and I
[07:35] have to take it off exchange um I was a
[07:38] weird case where I bought my um uh
[07:42] Ledger back then like I think over four
[07:45] years ago now actually on the first day
[07:48] where I got my Bitcoin like I bought my
[07:51] Bitcoin and ordered directly Ledger um
[07:54] out of curiosity not of knowing that
[07:58] it's important but out of curiosity
[08:00] because I saw a video like oh how to do
[08:02] self custody I was like what what is
[08:03] self custody like what do even this is
[08:06] like I just ordered a cust out of
[08:09] curiosity and have my Bitcoin ever since
[08:11] since the first day self custody uh
[08:14] which has been an amazing experience and
[08:17] uh so far also never lost anything but
[08:20] it was 2020 it's it's has been H but I
[08:22] think a lot of people are actually
[08:24] scared of losing their Bitcoin because
[08:26] you have so many prominent stories
[08:29] granted they're all from uh not all but
[08:33] the the more prominent ones are from
[08:35] like further down the line in in the
[08:37] history it's like gets less and less the
[08:39] people lose their Bitcoin um but H how
[08:42] do we take away this like people are
[08:45] scared to lose the Bitcoin they don't
[08:46] trust in their own capabilities they
[08:48] feel like they have to uh study that
[08:50] like for five years and then only they
[08:53] can maybe have custody de yeah well I
[08:55] think um Bitcoin is freedom money and
[08:58] freedom money comes with respon
[08:59] responsibility and I think that there's
[09:00] nothing more you can do than just put in
[09:02] the hours to understand what you're
[09:03] doing Bitcoin wallets have become a lot
[09:06] easier over the years uh we've just got
[09:08] all you have to do nowadays is back up a
[09:10] 12 or 24w seed
[09:12] phrase uh you know in in the early days
[09:14] it was very different we had you know
[09:16] raw private keys and we couldn't just
[09:18] back up one of those keys we had to back
[09:20] up each one individually so wallets are
[09:23] becoming easier but I think because of
[09:26] the nature of Bitcoin because it's self-
[09:28] responsibility and Freedom you have to
[09:30] put in a few hours to understand self-
[09:33] custody to understand how all the the
[09:35] different wallets work or how your
[09:36] wallet Works what is a seed phrase why
[09:39] you need to back it up and uh you know
[09:41] once you've mastered the basics you you
[09:44] can fairly confidently self custody
[09:46] Bitcoin the wallets these days make it
[09:48] so
[09:49] simple again just know how to secure
[09:52] your seed any other parts you may need
[09:54] some people use a pass phrase or
[09:55] multisig but if you're just getting
[09:56] started don't even think about that
[09:58] quite yet
[10:00] and yeah hours I think that's that's all
[10:04] and you don't need to put you don't need
[10:05] to put five years into this right you
[10:07] can do I don't know how many hours it
[10:09] requires maybe not not not five years
[10:12] definitely maybe one or two months of
[10:16] not really consistent work but one or
[10:17] two months of curiosity and
[10:19] experimenting and trying new things all
[10:22] all you really
[10:23] need what role does the amount in
[10:28] Bitcoin you hold
[10:30] play in what secur the solution and and
[10:33] how you how you secure your Bitcoin play
[10:36] yeah def if the more Bitcoin you have
[10:39] definitely the the higher security level
[10:41] you need and I think more security
[10:43] always comes with increased
[10:45] complexity so if you do happen to have a
[10:48] lot of Bitcoin I think and you want to
[10:50] increase the security of your setup it
[10:52] requires a bit more time uh studying and
[10:55] and learning what exactly you're using
[10:58] for example if you're looking into
[10:59] multi- multisig will require a bit more
[11:02] experimenting and and studying than
[11:04] something like single Sig so the the
[11:07] more Bitcoin you have the more security
[11:09] you need definitely but that more
[11:12] security comes with increased complexity
[11:14] and therefore you might need to spend a
[11:16] few more hours uh studying or get
[11:19] assistance from somebody who knows what
[11:20] they're doing when does multi um makes
[11:23] sense is that like an amount you you
[11:26] have in your head with like okay if you
[11:27] have about about that uh that many
[11:30] Bitcoin right now uh you should
[11:32] definitely do a
[11:34] mtis yeah I'm not sure about amounts I
[11:37] think what's very important about
[11:38] multisig is that the point is to
[11:41] geographically distribute your Bitcoin
[11:43] so if you have if you're using multisig
[11:45] because you're high net worth but all
[11:47] three seed phrases are in your house
[11:49] it's kind of defeating the point the
[11:51] purpose of multisig maybe you need a
[11:53] pass phrase in that case so I think if
[11:55] you can geographically distribute coins
[11:59] or you're a company or you're a business
[12:01] with multiple um key individuals then
[12:04] you look into multisig if you've got um
[12:09] 100 Bitcoin you probably have a few
[12:11] places to put your coins maybe you've
[12:12] got vaults Bank vaults in in different
[12:15] locations then yeah multi6 for you I'm
[12:18] not sure about a a Bitcoin amount
[12:20] maybe 10 Bitcoin um I'm not really sure
[12:24] I think it it depends more on your
[12:27] circumstances and the amount of of
[12:29] Bitcoin you have both need to work
[12:32] together yeah really interesting um
[12:34] maybe for I mean even if you have 10
[12:37] Bitcoin right but you only you keep
[12:39] three seed phases in your house you're
[12:40] still defeating the purpose of of that
[12:42] multi Sig yeah it's it's super
[12:44] interesting when when we think about U
[12:46] multi signature and and then you can
[12:49] actually go ahead and even if someone
[12:52] like if if someone comes to the house
[12:53] like said like oh give me your your
[12:55] Bitcoin you can like oh yeah here it's
[12:57] my please please have it uh but you have
[13:00] like five other keys or something like
[13:01] that so but there there's a lot of uh I
[13:04] mean I think the risk of that is is is
[13:06] hopefully low for for for
[13:09] bitcoiners uh but it's definitely
[13:11] something just just to make sure we we
[13:14] we have everyone in the boat what is
[13:17] multi and what is single Sig like what
[13:20] is that in the first place yeah so we'll
[13:23] start with single signature and single
[13:26] signature means you only need one single
[13:30] signature to spend your Bitcoin so you
[13:32] only need one seed phrase to authorize a
[13:35] transaction if you've got your 12 or 24
[13:37] words you can spend any Bitcoin within
[13:39] that Wallet multisig requires multiple
[13:42] seed phrases to sign off on transactions
[13:46] so first when you create your wallet
[13:48] firstly you'll decide how many seeds
[13:50] exist in this wallet and secondly you'll
[13:52] decide how many seeds are acquired to
[13:55] spend Bitcoin for example a very common
[13:58] multi- setup is two of three and that
[14:01] means there's three seed phrases in that
[14:03] wallet but you require two signatures so
[14:06] two of those seeds will be needed to
[14:08] spend Bitcoin so it kind of depends
[14:11] um the way we classify it is how many
[14:14] seeds are required to spend single Sig
[14:17] requires a Single Seed a single
[14:19] signature multi requires multiple
[14:21] signatures or multiple
[14:25] seeds what's your thoughts on on uh
[14:28] collaborative multi signature where you
[14:31] have one entity in this I don't know
[14:34] three or five or whatever how many keys
[14:36] you have uh uh is a company in the end
[14:40] of the
[14:41] day yeah I think generally it's a good
[14:43] idea to do that um if you want multisig
[14:46] uh you just need to ensure that it's
[14:48] done in a trust list way you should not
[14:50] be trusting that third party they should
[14:52] only ever have one seed phrase they
[14:54] should never have the right to spend
[14:55] your coins so for example most of them
[14:58] are
[14:59] uh you set it up with them it's two of
[15:01] three seed phrases are required to spend
[15:04] they only generate one seed phrase so
[15:06] you're not trusting you don't really
[15:08] trust them with your Bitcoin you trust
[15:10] them to hold one seed in case you lose
[15:12] one of your two but they don't have
[15:14] access to your coins and that's key in
[15:15] my opinion um otherwise I think it's
[15:19] generally a good idea if you if you want
[15:20] to um distribute your coins and you
[15:22] don't have uh different multiple
[15:24] locations to geographically distribute
[15:27] them it's it's not a bad idea to do
[15:31] that uh one thing I will say actually
[15:33] though is if you're dealing with a small
[15:34] amount of Bitcoin you have to think is
[15:37] it worth it to do that because they do
[15:40] charge the monthly or the yearly fee so
[15:42] if you're not dealing with a lot of
[15:43] Bitcoin perhaps the fee doesn't justify
[15:46] how many coins you
[15:47] have absolutely I mean I mean uh it's
[15:51] also an interesting discussion in in
[15:52] Bitcoin because you also have to think
[15:54] about the the the future of value of it
[15:59] and uh who who said that um I think Rick
[16:01] said it on my podcast the the one who
[16:04] lost 25
[16:06] Bitcoins uh I don't know if you if you
[16:08] know the story uh but yeah he had had it
[16:12] in self custody and he lost 25 Bitcoin
[16:14] and he said something very interesting
[16:16] in the end of the podcast secure your
[16:18] Bitcoin uh in the best way before you
[16:21] get hilariously Rich so that that was
[16:24] that was something interesting to think
[16:25] about uh like do do do it uh in calmness
[16:30] uh before uh your your Bitcoin 2x's or
[16:34] 5x's and maybe like okay think about
[16:37] your Bitcoin stack and like okay what if
[16:39] this uh five X's now uh would I take
[16:42] different care of of of those Bitcoin
[16:45] because it might well does yeah yeah
[16:48] secure your Bitcoin as if it were worth
[16:51] 10x the current
[16:52] value is that's a good rule yeah I think
[16:57] um I've heard nvk said that quite a lot
[16:59] I'm not sure who came up with it but
[17:00] I've I've definitely seen that make the
[17:02] rounds on
[17:04] Twitter it it makes sense because uh
[17:07] it's it's like 10x is it will not happen
[17:10] probably not overnight but you should
[17:12] think about the future and especially as
[17:14] Bitcoin as we have a this low time
[17:16] preference uh definitely what should
[17:19] people uh stay away from you already
[17:21] said uh um collaborative multi signature
[17:24] where you only have the minority of the
[17:26] keys is is one one thing is a self
[17:29] custody Solutions where you're like okay
[17:31] that's that's something you should be
[17:33] aware of that's something you should uh
[17:35] avoid uh in in any
[17:39] situation yeah uh I think one of the key
[17:41] things is to avoid complexity you don't
[17:45] want to make your Bitcoin setup too
[17:46] complex because you're going to lose
[17:48] Bitcoin to user error rather than an
[17:50] attacker um so I do like one-on-one help
[17:53] sessions with people and I had a great
[17:56] example of a lady she didn't really
[17:58] really quite understand what she was
[18:00] doing but she had a multi- setup but
[18:02] each of her seed phrases had an
[18:04] additional pass phrase on top and she
[18:06] had no clue what she was doing and she
[18:08] thought she lost her entire bcoin stack
[18:10] thankfully she had her her seeds and her
[18:13] pass raises backed up and we spent a few
[18:16] hours testing it all and eventually we
[18:18] got her Bitcoin so like I said earlier
[18:21] you need to balance security with
[18:24] complexity you need to keep it simple
[18:26] this is a famous rule in Bitcoin it's
[18:28] keep it simple stupid or keep it stupid
[18:30] simple something like that and too much
[18:33] complexity means you're going to shoot
[18:35] yourself in the foot especially if you
[18:37] do not know what you're doing that is
[18:39] something very important I think a lot
[18:41] of people tend to overlook uh they'll
[18:43] hear multisig is the best way to secure
[18:45] your Bitcoin and they'll just do it
[18:46] without knowing really what's going on
[18:49] and um I think multisig isn't for
[18:51] everyone and increasing complexity isn't
[18:53] for
[18:55] everyone I love that a lot very cool uh
[18:57] in terms of
[18:59] uh doing it uh yourself versus doing it
[19:01] with a with a partner how do you look
[19:04] look at that like do are you
[19:06] recommending people actually go ahead
[19:07] and and study it uh deeply or like okay
[19:10] no like uh have a because there are so
[19:13] many different uh there's like this the
[19:15] service providers I would say with like
[19:18] Unchained and Cara and and that kind of
[19:21] a thing then there's like um advisors
[19:25] like the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin
[19:26] advisory and yourself you you can book a
[19:29] session with you uh and then there's
[19:32] like the the hardcore way of like you
[19:34] look everything up yourself and you you
[19:37] do it uh the the way you how do you look
[19:40] at um those kind of options yeah I think
[19:45] you need a bit of both right you need to
[19:47] definitely understand what you're doing
[19:48] yourself because even if somebody does
[19:50] advise you through it all and you don't
[19:52] really know what you're doing it's not
[19:53] very uh it's not a good idea Bitcoin is
[19:56] your responsibility at the end of the
[19:57] day it's not somebody else's resp
[19:58] responsibility so you must understand
[20:00] the structure of your setup what's
[20:02] required to access your coins what you
[20:04] need to secure what needs to be backed
[20:06] up but definitely working with people
[20:08] who've done this for years is is a good
[20:10] idea because they know the best
[20:13] practices they know exactly what you
[20:15] need to do to secure the coins but you
[20:18] can't just rely on them to do it for you
[20:20] you need to understand exactly what
[20:22] you've done and hopefully everyone you
[20:24] know all these advisories are explaining
[20:26] to you exactly what your setup is how it
[20:28] works and if they aren't there to help
[20:31] you tomorrow what you need to do to
[20:33] spend your coins or what you need to do
[20:35] to back them up and secure them so
[20:38] there's a bit of both advisories um I
[20:40] think there it's great for somebody to
[20:42] give you a helping hand but you do need
[20:43] to understand what what you're being
[20:45] helped with and what exactly you've done
[20:48] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[20:52] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[20:55] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[20:57] at that Beauty I love it so much coin
[21:00] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[21:03] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[21:06] go out there and show that you are a
[21:09] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[21:12] Bitcoin only and coin Vigilant just
[21:15] dropped a completely new and amazing
[21:17] Genesis edition of their watch
[21:20] collection you have the date of the
[21:22] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[21:26] and of course also the block height and
[21:28] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[21:32] the level of detail they put in in this
[21:34] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[21:37] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[21:40] down in the descriptions I love those
[21:42] watches so so much if you watch or
[21:46] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[21:48] I'll guess you already bought some
[21:50] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[21:53] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[21:56] in a hardware wallet my personal
[21:58] commentation for hard wallet is the
[22:00] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[22:03] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[22:05] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[22:08] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[22:11] with the code Robin at the checkout
[22:13] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[22:17] your bitbox and the next step is to
[22:20] really level up your sovereignty as an
[22:22] individual you have to have the most
[22:25] secure self custody setup you have to
[22:27] secure your own devices you have to
[22:30] protect your privacy you have to set up
[22:33] an inheritance plan and depending on
[22:35] where you live you even want to have a
[22:38] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[22:41] in case something goes really really
[22:42] wrong and through all those steps the
[22:44] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[22:47] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[22:50] way.com
[22:51] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[22:54] minute free call to find out how you can
[22:57] level up your sovereignty yeah I I think
[23:01] a great question that everyone should
[23:03] ask themselves if they work with with
[23:05] someone else is like I mean it's a great
[23:08] question even if you do it yourself like
[23:10] what happens if that advisor is tomorrow
[23:13] not there and you want to recover your
[23:15] uh your Bitcoin what what do you do do
[23:17] you have actual control over everything
[23:19] and uh do you know do you know it well
[23:23] enough without calling them because they
[23:26] might not like they might not there so I
[23:29] think that's a really important uh step
[23:32] that people really Overlook sometimes
[23:36] yeah yeah the the best question is if
[23:39] you lose your Hardware wallet you lose
[23:40] your computer you don't have the advisor
[23:43] anymore can you recover your Bitcoin via
[23:46] the seed phrase or whatever backups you
[23:48] have and um yeah if you can't then there
[23:51] might be a problem and you should do a
[23:52] bit more
[23:54] studying I love that so like you lose
[23:57] your computer your Hardware wallet and
[23:59] you don't have access to the advisor uh
[24:01] you still have access to a Bitcoin yes
[24:03] or no like that that kind of question I
[24:07] love it a lot really cool um let's look
[24:10] at uh uh Bitcoin hard wallets
[24:13] obviously uh uh full disclosure I mean
[24:15] everyone knows that uh bitbox is one of
[24:18] my sponsors uh on the podcast as also
[24:21] the Bitcoin way is uh so I'm not
[24:25] entirely
[24:26] objective hopefully you more than than
[24:29] me uh but I like bit bitbox just as an
[24:32] really easy to to find your way into the
[24:35] self custody game and then like for me
[24:37] the Bitcoin way is a good way of like uh
[24:40] okay how go do I go really deep on the
[24:43] topic and really think about something
[24:45] uh way more secure than just one uh
[24:48] Hardware wallet but uh in terms of
[24:51] Hardware wallets uh what do you
[24:53] generally look at I know there's like
[24:55] air gap and not air gap there's
[24:57] different kinds of hard wallets with
[24:59] like touch screens uh there's hard walls
[25:01] with buttons there's hard wallets with
[25:04] all kind of different designs uh how how
[25:06] do you in generally judge a hardware
[25:09] wallet if you like it or not and for
[25:12] what situation also yeah I think one of
[25:15] the most important things is whether the
[25:17] source code is viewable or open source
[25:20] or not so we all know famously that
[25:22] ledger is closed source and not many
[25:25] people trust Ledger because you can't
[25:27] tell what they what exactly they're
[25:28] doing behind the scenes you don't know
[25:29] what your Ledger device what the code is
[25:32] is doing so that's the the first
[25:34] starting point I think is is your device
[25:37] open source or not I know bitbox is open
[25:40] source and cold card is Source viewable
[25:42] there's a lot of debate over cold card's
[25:45] open source status I believe they say
[25:47] they're open source or they say they're
[25:49] Source viewable so you can see the code
[25:51] but you cannot replicate or use that
[25:52] code for your own um
[25:55] project what is the difference there
[25:57] like if if I can see the co code why can
[26:01] I not use it yeah so cold card's license
[26:04] I may be um I don't know the the exact
[26:06] details but from my understanding is
[26:08] that you can view the code but you
[26:09] cannot actually use that code for your
[26:11] own business ventures or you can't you
[26:14] can't duplicate it and um you know use
[26:17] it yourself and the one of the key
[26:19] arguments there is that if somebody else
[26:21] can't use your code they have no
[26:23] incentive to review it and um upgrade it
[26:26] if need be where if you can use let's
[26:29] say a bit boxes code and you you you
[26:31] have an incentive to review it because
[26:33] maybe you'll use it you'll you'll check
[26:35] it for any bugs or anything like that
[26:38] and if you identify a bug you'll
[26:39] probably notify bitbox and uh they'll
[26:41] they'll fix that bug so that is um the
[26:45] the the key difference is that you can't
[26:47] copy code it's a legal
[26:50] difference yes yes okay now I got it
[26:54] yeah yeah and um what are what are other
[26:59] good things for a a hardware
[27:01] wallet um I think track record is a good
[27:04] thing you know you don't want to really
[27:06] want to be using a hard wallet that
[27:07] dropped two months ago and um it doesn't
[27:11] have a long history of working well it
[27:13] hasn't been battle tested for example
[27:15] the treasure is the first Hardware
[27:17] wallet the treasure is the most battle
[27:19] tested Hardware wallet and we we know
[27:23] that it's pretty secure there was a
[27:25] issue with the old Treasures where you
[27:27] could extract the seed phrase if you
[27:29] were very sophisticated and you had the
[27:31] physical device now trees's introduced a
[27:34] secure element chip so you can't
[27:35] actually do that anymore but battle
[27:38] tested is a is a very good thing bitbox
[27:40] cold card treaser are all pretty battle
[27:43] tested another one I like air gap but I
[27:47] know there is an argument that air gap
[27:48] doesn't really make a difference because
[27:50] at the end of the day you're still
[27:51] communicating via SD card with your
[27:55] computer I know uh when you plug in
[27:58] something you're still communicating
[28:01] data some people will argue that via SD
[28:05] card you can tell what that data is but
[28:06] when you plug it in it's it's more blind
[28:08] you can't exactly tell what What DOT is
[28:11] being communicated so I like a gap some
[28:13] people will argue that it doesn't really
[28:14] make a
[28:16] difference and um another one is altcoin
[28:21] support if you're Bitcoin owning people
[28:23] like tend to like a Bitcoin only device
[28:25] because the developers hyperfocus on
[28:28] securing Bitcoin they don't have this
[28:29] noise of just securing a thousand random
[28:32] shitcoins so that is another one another
[28:36] thing I look for in a hardware wallet
[28:38] for for this air G uh air g means uh
[28:42] there's no cable between your Hardware
[28:44] wallet and your computer but you still
[28:46] have to communicate and the
[28:48] communication is then an SD card yeah SD
[28:51] card or QR code or I believe NFC as well
[28:55] is there I mean I'm I'm not technically
[28:57] enough for that actually and air G was
[29:00] always one topic where I'm I was like a
[29:04] little bit like why do we need air gap
[29:07] like if if there's like an communication
[29:09] line in the computer like does it even
[29:11] matter like what communication line it
[29:13] is and and for people it's really easy
[29:15] especially for newcomers like just like
[29:17] take take your cable and plug it in the
[29:20] in the commuter that's how they they
[29:21] used to do it um but what's the argument
[29:23] for like using an air gaped um uh
[29:27] Hardware wallet yeah so the argument is
[29:30] that if you plug something directly into
[29:32] your computer you're you're plugging it
[29:35] into an Internet connect device and that
[29:37] has a direct link between your Hardware
[29:39] that's securing your seat phrase and the
[29:42] computer and you can't really tell what
[29:43] information is being transmitted between
[29:46] the two so for example if you're
[29:49] plugging in a ledger into your computer
[29:51] you can't read the code of that perhaps
[29:55] the the computer can access your seed
[29:57] phrase who knows the the argument with
[30:00] airgap is that because it's never even
[30:02] plugged into a internet connected device
[30:05] that's just not possible because it
[30:07] never it never touches an Internet
[30:10] connected device you use it fully air
[30:12] gapped but there is still some
[30:14] communication you still need to use your
[30:16] computer to build Bitcoin transactions
[30:19] you take your SD card or your QR code
[30:21] you plug it into the egap device and you
[30:23] sign that transaction and the SD card
[30:25] goes back into the computer there is
[30:28] communication there but it's it's more
[30:30] easy to audit you can see exactly what
[30:32] the cold card's written to the SD and
[30:34] you can see what your computer's written
[30:35] to the SD card where with if you're just
[30:38] plugging it you know in a in a ledger
[30:39] you can't really tell what's what's
[30:41] being transmitted between the
[30:42] two so there is not one Hardware wallet
[30:46] that is completely actually air gap that
[30:49] has Absolut no communication outside of
[30:51] that Hardware wallet because you always
[30:52] have to communicate
[30:54] somehow yeah well well air gap is per
[30:57] def finish and it just means it doesn't
[30:59] connect directly to the computer so the
[31:01] cold card can be used fully air gapped
[31:03] but you still do need to communicate
[31:05] somehow and um it is air gapped right
[31:09] but the uh that just means you're not
[31:12] plugging it directly into the computer
[31:14] you still communicate via SD interesting
[31:16] yeah uh maybe maybe a question that uh
[31:19] is stupid but uh like why not making an
[31:25] hard wallet where you can do everything
[31:28] on on there and and you don't need a
[31:30] computer don't need a communication to
[31:33] computer directly is is it possible to
[31:35] build a computer inside of the hard
[31:37] wallet to do it all all
[31:40] there um the thing is you need to
[31:42] actually broadcast your Bitcoin
[31:44] transaction to the network so there does
[31:46] need to be some sort of connection to
[31:48] the internet and if you had a hardware
[31:51] device that did connect to the internet
[31:52] you would be defeating the purpose of
[31:54] the hardware device um the the point is
[31:57] to be completely off offline so even
[31:58] building your your Bitcoin
[32:00] transaction uh that needs to be done
[32:02] connected to the internet so that you
[32:04] can fetch your transaction history you
[32:07] can fetch your Bitcoin balance and you
[32:09] can build that
[32:11] transaction um you know with all that
[32:13] information
[32:14] absolutely I that that's a really good
[32:18] point like if if you build everything
[32:21] you need into the hardare wallet uh then
[32:24] it's kind of like uh no longer offline
[32:28] it's an online device and then it's like
[32:30] a a hot wallet in that moment uh then
[32:33] moving forward yeah really good it's
[32:36] basically then a phone if you have a
[32:38] wallet on your phone it's it's it's kind
[32:39] of that even though like different but
[32:41] it's it's it's uh it's kind of that then
[32:44] um you have a pin tweet is really also
[32:46] interesting and and fitting in that
[32:48] topic with how secure is your your
[32:50] backup phrase and uh I actually got that
[32:54] question I think
[32:56] like I think I'm a month ago or
[32:58] something like that uh from uh a person
[33:02] that says like was like kind of like
[33:05] into Bitcoin and he was asking me okay
[33:07] how Bitcoin he's already why Bitcoin but
[33:09] he's like now how Bitcoin and he asked
[33:11] me oh the 24 words and then I was like
[33:14] then he was asking where are those words
[33:16] coming from I was explaining him like oh
[33:18] it's a set of words then then I can
[33:20] guess it like right then I just like
[33:22] running through a computer programing
[33:24] and guess anyone's codes uh I also
[33:28] remember one funny tweet uh where
[33:30] someone was like oh I guess someone's uh
[33:33] someone's Hardware wallet uh but there's
[33:36] no Bitcoin on there so I guess someone's
[33:38] backup seed phrase but there's no uh
[33:41] Bitcoin on there no you just created a
[33:42] new wallet um but talk talk to me like
[33:46] why this is nonsense and and what also
[33:49] you covered in that short video that
[33:51] that you pinned to to your profile yeah
[33:55] so that video is very fascinating um my
[33:57] my PIN tweet on Twitter it's a 24w seed
[34:01] phrase is 256 bits so it's 256 ones or
[34:05] zeros and your seed phrase is just
[34:07] essentially a random number a whole
[34:10] bunch of ones and zeros until you reach
[34:12] 256 characters and because of the you
[34:15] know the power of exponentials it's it's
[34:18] actually very difficult for the human
[34:20] mind to comprehend how large that number
[34:23] is and how statistically impossible it
[34:26] is to recreate that number
[34:28] and in that video I explained that
[34:30] guessing 124w seed phrase is equivalent
[34:34] I can't remember exactly the video I
[34:35] filmed quite a while ago but it's
[34:38] equivalent to guessing something like a
[34:39] star in the random Universe if you get
[34:42] that right you need to guess a grain of
[34:45] sand on earth if you get that right you
[34:47] need to guess a human cell in the body
[34:50] and if you get that right there was one
[34:52] more thing you had to guess some
[34:53] ridiculous thing and and you that's
[34:55] equivalent to cracking a seed phrase
[34:58] so just because of the power of
[35:00] exponentials and huge numbers
[35:02] replicating a seed phrase is just
[35:04] impossible and that and then uh if if
[35:07] you have a lot of Bitcoin you should
[35:08] also have it in in multi and this makes
[35:11] it uh on top of impossible double
[35:15] impossible I guess yeah yeah with multi
[35:18] as well you need um let's say you have
[35:21] two of three multisig this will be quite
[35:24] um complex but if you have two of three
[35:26] multisig you
[35:28] you can't only guess two seeds if you
[35:30] guess two seeds you still can't spend
[35:32] the Bitcoin you actually need to guess
[35:34] three seeds even though you only need
[35:36] two to spend because you need three
[35:38] public Keys you need the public key for
[35:41] each seed phrase and then you can use
[35:43] the two the two uh that whichever two
[35:45] you pick so the it's already impossible
[35:48] to crack a 24 seed phase cracking three
[35:51] of
[35:52] them triple impossible impossible times
[35:56] three yeah impossible times times three
[36:00] I love that a lot yeah but it's it's uh
[36:03] I guess begin a question that comes up a
[36:06] lot I I still see it yeah I was like oh
[36:08] yeah then I can just
[36:10] guess
[36:12] Wall go to math class yeah yeah um one
[36:18] one more topic that I wanted to discuss
[36:20] with the uh Bitcoin hard wallet thing
[36:22] and I hope we we kind of covered the the
[36:25] the beginnings of everything a little
[36:27] bit like people have like an overview of
[36:29] that and then can go deeper in some some
[36:31] topics um utex o management I think it's
[36:35] something that is overlooked a lot even
[36:37] with people that have hard wallets and
[36:39] even though uh you have um a little bit
[36:43] of an understanding how to secure a
[36:45] Bitcoin um I made a whole um one hour
[36:49] video with vicet on uto management uh
[36:52] maybe I I I think about it when I
[36:54] publish the video and and Link it or you
[36:56] can just like uh search vicet on on my
[36:59] YouTube channel it will also pop up um
[37:02] but what is the importance of utex O
[37:05] management when thinking about uh self-
[37:07] custody and and why should someone even
[37:10] begin to uh research what is you
[37:14] management yeah so the best way to think
[37:16] about it is this is the example I like
[37:19] to give people you have a wallet just a
[37:22] normal wallet in real life W with your
[37:24] notes and your coins in would you rather
[37:26] have a $100 in that wallet or would you
[37:29] rather have
[37:30] $11 coins I don't know what coins they
[37:33] use in the States but I'm sure there's a
[37:35] dollar coin so would you rather have a
[37:37] $100 note or 100 single coins of course
[37:40] you'd rather have the $100 note and
[37:43] Bitcoin wallets are are similar you
[37:45] don't want a whole bunch of small little
[37:47] Bitcoin uh amounts in your wallet you'd
[37:50] rather have larger amounts and the
[37:52] reason for this is by the way let's
[37:55] first explain what a utxo is every time
[37:58] you receive Bitcoin you receive a new
[38:01] utxo every transaction is a new
[38:05] utxo and if you have let's say you've
[38:08] received Bitcoin 10 times you'll have 10
[38:10] utxos if they're all small amounts you
[38:13] don't that's like receiving 10 $1 coins
[38:16] instead of
[38:17] $10 and when it comes to bitcoin
[38:21] transactions they're priced dependent on
[38:23] how much space you take on the
[38:25] blockchain there's this conception that
[38:28] if you spend uh like in the Fiat system
[38:31] they'll charge you a transaction fee
[38:33] based on the amount where in Bitcoin it
[38:35] charges you based on how much space you
[38:37] take on on the
[38:39] blockchain so if I need to spend 10
[38:42] utxos or 10 $1 coins that's going to
[38:45] take a lot of space and effort to spend
[38:48] where if I have just a $10 note it's
[38:50] equivalent to one utxo it's a lot more
[38:53] efficient and therefore you pay less in
[38:56] fees
[38:57] so the more utxos have the more
[39:01] expensive your Bitcoin transactions are
[39:03] the solution is to combine your utxos
[39:06] together to create larger utxos and have
[39:10] fewer of them it's equivalent to taking
[39:12] your dollar coins going to the bank
[39:15] giving them 10 and getting them a $10
[39:16] note back and when you spend coins
[39:20] instead of spending 10 ones you spend a
[39:22] $10 you're taking less space less fees
[39:25] and you're going to save a lot of money
[39:27] one of the key problems is people are
[39:29] like dcing Bitcoin every week they buy
[39:31] $100 and it's draw to self- custody if
[39:34] you've got $1,000 you've got 10 utxos
[39:37] it's better to build a balance first
[39:40] then withdraw so you have one large
[39:42] utxos instead of 10 small ones spending
[39:45] becomes a lot cheaper I love that idea
[39:47] and uh when there's like two things like
[39:51] first of all you have a wallet already
[39:54] and uh you want to combine them that's
[39:56] basically making one transaction to the
[39:58] same wallet to combine all this uh utxos
[40:02] and then it's also like your utxo plan
[40:05] of okay you accumulate Bitcoin on an
[40:07] exchange and then you have yourself
[40:10] custody solution um how do you go ahead
[40:13] and transfer it I always uh hear the
[40:17] amount of 1 million Sates uh you have to
[40:20] gather then uh transfer it um is 1
[40:24] million satos is enough uh what should
[40:27] people do that uh where like 1 million
[40:30] soses is like uh a lot of money already
[40:33] like it's like a half a year of stack or
[40:35] something like that uh what do you how
[40:37] do you think about that yeah um firstly
[40:40] one thing I will say is when I when I'm
[40:41] explaining utxos it's a bit hard to
[40:43] explain it without a visual visual
[40:45] representation so I've got a YouTube on
[40:48] video uh YouTube video on UT so
[40:50] management where I actually run through
[40:51] it in sparrow and I compare the fees and
[40:54] it's a bit easier to explain when you
[40:56] you've got a wallet open
[40:57] so if that was a bit confusing I I would
[40:59] recommend watching that and then
[41:01] regarding minimum utxo size I think it
[41:04] really depends on your stack size and
[41:07] what you do with your Bitcoin because if
[41:09] you're spending Bitcoin you're going to
[41:11] treat your utxo very differently to a
[41:13] long-term hler if you strictly long-term
[41:16] holding I would say a million sets is a
[41:19] a good amount if you're spending Bitcoin
[41:21] every day you don't need to have a
[41:23] million set utxo you can get away with
[41:25] having 100 sets and if you you know
[41:27] spending
[41:29] Bitcoin so I have two wallets two main
[41:33] types of wallets I've got a long-term
[41:37] huddle stack and a spending stack for
[41:40] your long-term huddle stack 01 Bitcoin
[41:43] or a million SATs is a good minimum I
[41:46] would say is it is that a million yeah 0
[41:48] Z1 is a million sets I think Point a01
[41:52] yes yeah that's a good amount yeah for
[41:55] your shortterm stack you can get get
[41:57] away with having a a smaller amount
[41:58] maybe 100,000 sets but it also depends
[42:02] on how much Bitcoin you have if you have
[42:03] 10 coins do you really want a
[42:06] 01 maybe you want a one Bitcoin as your
[42:10] minimum so it depends on two things your
[42:13] stack size and what you do with your
[42:15] coins is it short to medium-term or is
[42:16] it
[42:17] longterm but 01 generally speaking is a
[42:20] good
[42:21] minimum absolutely really cool and also
[42:24] one thing that uh I only learned
[42:27] actually uh I think like 10 months ago
[42:30] or something like that when you have
[42:32] multi obviously then uh it it comes a
[42:36] you need a little bit more if you want
[42:38] to have the same security uh so like uh
[42:42] with with single Sig and multis there's
[42:44] a small difference where you need a
[42:46] little bit more of Sates to be safe uh I
[42:50] guess if you have the same image yes
[42:53] yeah well yeah the thing is with multi
[42:56] like I was explaining earlier Bitcoin is
[42:58] price dependent on how much space you
[43:00] take on the blockchain because multisig
[43:03] requires multiple signatures you're
[43:06] actually leaving more data and you're
[43:07] taking up more space on chain because
[43:10] there's simply more signatures
[43:12] involved so exactly I think 01 could be
[43:16] okay for multisig just understand that
[43:18] when you spend that the fee will be
[43:19] higher for multisig than it will be for
[43:21] single
[43:22] Sig absolutely yeah uh when should
[43:26] someone go go up to a layer two like
[43:29] what is the amount of Bitcoin where you
[43:30] say like that that is like uh you you're
[43:34] getting uh you're spending so much on on
[43:38] on fees on the layer one already uh it
[43:41] makes sense to have like a stack just on
[43:43] on on a lightning layer too for
[43:46] example yeah yeah again I think this
[43:49] depends on what you're doing with your
[43:51] Bitcoin here in South Africa we've got a
[43:53] lot of places to spend Bitcoin and a lot
[43:55] of my friends are orange pilled so
[43:57] because I'm capable of using lightning
[44:00] daily if I want to and because I I'm my
[44:03] friends and I transact over lightning it
[44:05] makes sense for me to have a fair amount
[44:07] of Bitcoin en lightning maybe um what is
[44:11] 100,000 sets I can't even the price is
[44:13] too volatile to know but 200,000 sets
[44:16] may be enl lightening for me but if
[44:18] you're somewhere where you can't
[44:20] actually use lightning um you're not
[44:22] using it you you don't have somewhere to
[44:23] spend it you don't have friends you can
[44:25] transact with I don't know really know
[44:27] if you even need lightning in the first
[44:29] place um for for larger amounts I just
[44:33] always do on
[44:35] chain
[44:36] and 100,000 toes are currently 72 uh US
[44:42] Dollars 72 so that that because like one
[44:47] million zes you get now for
[44:50] 721 uh US Dollars obviously the current
[44:53] price uh then it will fractur uh because
[44:57] yeah and then 10 million 7,000 and then
[44:59] like 100 million because 100 million
[45:01] Sates is one Bitcoin uh
[45:04] 72,000 100 currently so we we I think we
[45:08] did did we hit yesterday the alltime
[45:10] high I we yeah we didn't I've been
[45:14] watching actually I've had the chart
[45:15] open with the alltime high marked and no
[45:17] we didn't quite surpass it yeah it's
[45:20] it's it's it's a frustrating we were so
[45:22] close what I think we just like a few
[45:24] hundred or like a $1,000 or something
[45:27] from it yeah yeah like a thousand yeah
[45:31] thousand frustrating frustrating
[45:34] yeah really cool um perfect before we
[45:37] come to the end routine and and closing
[45:39] this up is there anything that you wanna
[45:41] add to this episode anything that you
[45:42] feel like is missing in in that
[45:45] discussion where like okay let's let's
[45:46] let's add that uh thing also here yeah
[45:50] um I will say a lot of the the when
[45:52] people ask how much Bitcoin should I
[45:54] have enlightening or what should my
[45:55] minimum utx so it's very difficult to
[45:58] answer without knowing what exactly you
[46:00] do with Bitcoin and um how much you have
[46:03] these are the difficult questions to to
[46:05] just give estimates for because if you
[46:08] have 0.1 Bitcoin and you have 10 Bitcoin
[46:10] your utxo management is very different
[46:13] you should treat it very differently if
[46:15] you have 0.1 Bitcoin perhaps you have a
[46:18] 07 Bitcoin and a 03 for maybe shorter
[46:22] term to medium-term spending I don't
[46:24] know if you have 10 Bitcoin maybe you
[46:26] don't want any utxos under one coin and
[46:28] your long-term hling so it's very tough
[46:31] to to answer these questions and it
[46:32] really depends on your size and I think
[46:35] you need to understand um utxos how the
[46:39] fees work and then come up with your own
[46:42] um plan but generally if you are a
[46:45] long-term hler you've got a decent
[46:47] amount of Bitcoin 01 is a a good amount
[46:49] to uh have as a
[46:51] minimum uh another thing is I spoke
[46:55] about earlier is again I'll bring this
[46:57] up again is the complexity balancing
[46:59] complexity and security it is perfectly
[47:01] fine to start slow um especially if
[47:04] you're dealing with smaller amounts if
[47:06] you've just got into Bitcoin use a hot
[47:09] wallet people uh tend to disagree with
[47:13] this they say never use a hot wallet
[47:14] always have cold storage I store Bitcoin
[47:16] in hot wallets I have a decent amount of
[47:18] in hot wallets and I use that for medium
[47:20] to shortterm spending and I've never had
[47:23] a problem hot wallets are a lot more
[47:24] secure than people actually think so
[47:27] it's okay to start with the hot wallet
[47:29] understand seed phrases understand how
[47:30] to receive and send Bitcoin and once
[47:32] you've been stacking for a few months
[47:34] you've got a decent amount of Bitcoin
[47:36] get your first Hardware wallet and you
[47:38] know work from there you've got a
[47:40] hardware wallet understand how it works
[47:42] you can sign Bitcoin transactions
[47:45] offline and uh get familiar with that
[47:47] Tech then look into maybe increasing
[47:49] complexity if you have a lot more
[47:51] Bitcoin consider a pass phrase or
[47:53] consider a multisig so I'm a firm
[47:55] believer a big believer in that your
[47:57] setup should evolve over time you
[47:59] shouldn't get Bitcoin and jump into
[48:01] multisig it should be a a stepbystep
[48:05] process absolutely I love I love that a
[48:08] lot really cool perfect then uh let's
[48:11] come to the end routine or not the end a
[48:13] question that I ask every one of my
[48:15] guests uh is what can we learn from you
[48:18] besides all things Bitcoin what can you
[48:21] learn from
[48:22] me I'm not sure uh
[48:27] about my whole life has been Bitcoin I
[48:29] don't know I uh I'm only 21 years old
[48:32] and basically everything I've done with
[48:34] my life is Bitcoin so I love to train I
[48:38] love to train uh boxing MMA go to the
[48:42] gym so if you want to do pads that's
[48:45] what you can learn from me I guess
[48:47] really cool a lot a lot it is I L that a
[48:50] lot with with training and and uh I I
[48:54] right now actually I think like a few
[48:56] days ago
[48:57] uh on on Monday I switched from uh Jim
[49:01] to callisthenics now because I wanted to
[49:03] try something from new out and it's
[49:05] really challenging for me because I'm so
[49:08] tall I'm two meters and and jym is way
[49:10] easier if you're two
[49:12] meters callisthenics is really um
[49:15] something challenging for me but I
[49:17] always like to do that really cool and
[49:19] you're boxing and that's your main
[49:21] training uh thing or do you also trim or
[49:23] something else yeah I train um some form
[49:27] of martial arts Mo Tha or boxing twice a
[49:29] week and then I also have a gym
[49:31] membership so I'll go there other three
[49:34] or four days of the week really cool
[49:37] thank you so much uh we have end in the
[49:38] podcast where uh the previous guest is
[49:41] actually asking asking a question for
[49:42] the next guest without knowing who the
[49:44] next guest actually will be and the
[49:46] question for you is from the previous
[49:48] guest will Bitcoin become a world
[49:50] Reserve currency in our lifetime in yeah
[49:54] yes I would say so in my lifetime
[49:57] yes perfect So within the next like 80
[50:01] to 90 years or maybe 100 years depending
[50:03] on uh uh life
[50:06] expectancy yeah unless something tragic
[50:09] happens yeah absolutely really cool
[50:12] thank you so much before I let you go um
[50:15] where can people find you ask your
[50:16] questions DM you watch your videos yeah
[50:19] so on YouTube I'm Southern bitcoiner on
[50:22] Twitter it's co Tu and then I have a
[50:25] website Southern bitcoin.com and I help
[50:28] people one-on-one with Bitcoin at
[50:30] seats.com secure SATs was taken so it's
[50:34] just seats.com oh I probably also secure
[50:37] Bitcoin was was taking already yeah well
[50:40] I like the s's I like that the secure
[50:42] set so secure Bitcoin wasn't quite as
[50:44] smoo yeah but I should consider that
[50:47] actually um yeah really cool thank you
[50:50] so much um Cole for being on also thank
[50:52] you so much for everyone that is
[50:53] watching and listening as always I'll be
[50:55] back tomorrow with another episode
[50:57] byebye cool cheers byebye everyone
