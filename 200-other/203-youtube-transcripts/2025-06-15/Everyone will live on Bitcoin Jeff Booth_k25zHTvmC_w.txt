[00:00] where does inflation come from it only
[00:01] comes from manipulating money so why do
[00:03] you need to steal money from people to
[00:05] live in a productive Society none of the
[00:07] noise matters at all it's repricing
[00:09] everything people won't need to
[00:11] understand Bitcoin like you do or I do
[00:12] or anything else you're going to be just
[00:14] getting so much value out of the product
[00:16] or service that you're they're using on
[00:18] top of it just like they don't do the
[00:19] Deep work on what tcpip is today
[00:22] everything will actually be built on top
[00:24] of Bitcoin but Robin that's a really
[00:26] important thing that you just said
[00:28] because why are we both so passionate
[00:32] about a deflation sound money system as
[00:35] Bitcoin like why are we even talking so
[00:38] much about that that kind of a
[00:41] future yeah and and in let's not say
[00:45] deflation uh as a monetary system
[00:49] because I think it's a more accurate way
[00:51] to say a neutral a neutral mon monetary
[00:55] system that can't be
[00:57] manipulated um means that the natural
[01:00] state of the free market is
[01:02] deflationary and um and and I know
[01:06] that's for for your new listeners that's
[01:08] going to sound crazy um because they've
[01:10] been they've they all economics is
[01:13] taught the on top of a system that you
[01:16] must have inflation um to live in a
[01:19] productive Society but you have to ask
[01:22] yourself why is that true right why why
[01:25] do you need to and where does inflation
[01:27] come from um for the long term inflation
[01:30] come from it only comes from
[01:32] manipulating money making up more money
[01:34] so why do you need to steal money from
[01:37] people to have to live in a productive
[01:40] Society um and especially when
[01:45] productivity flows naturally to society
[01:47] in the form of lower
[01:49] prices um in a free market so and and if
[01:53] you just explore how that happens if you
[01:55] say um
[01:58] things uh scarce Things become stuck
[02:01] they go up in price and entrepreneurs go
[02:05] and create value by attacking those
[02:08] things and making them abundant and
[02:11] bringing bringing value and you wouldn't
[02:13] use the thing that that uh you wouldn't
[02:16] use the thing that an entrepreneur
[02:18] creates unless it created more value in
[02:20] your
[02:21] life and so now when you when you see
[02:25] that and and let's just use a couple of
[02:27] examples right this Riverside app that
[02:29] we're right now you wouldn't be using
[02:31] this one specifically You' be using Zoom
[02:34] or something else or if the value of
[02:37] this didn't give you tons of value if
[02:40] this raised in price to to a whole bunch
[02:43] more you would use a different uh a
[02:46] different service use another one if
[02:49] Google all of a sudden charged you a
[02:50] dollar a search you would use a
[02:53] different service um and and so you can
[02:56] see by your own actions your driving
[02:59] each of us is
[03:01] driving Val the value that we determine
[03:04] down right so through that through that
[03:08] action and as those prices fall we live
[03:11] in a monetary system that's opposite
[03:13] it's built on debt and so as those
[03:15] prices fall in a free market if it would
[03:19] if you allowed it to happen in the
[03:20] market we live in currently um the
[03:23] prices would collap not just prices the
[03:25] entire economic system would collapse
[03:28] because it's built on debt and debt gets
[03:30] more
[03:32] expensive with
[03:35] deflation so you you can't pay that back
[03:37] the debt so we live in a in a world it's
[03:41] it's it's it's a it's a crazy Paradox
[03:43] right we live in a world where we know
[03:46] we should know that everything we do is
[03:51] we're trying to find more value
[03:54] in and we celebrate those entrepreneurs
[03:56] that are giving us more value but we
[03:59] also live in a world that most of that
[04:01] value a lot of that value has to be
[04:03] extracted from us to protect the
[04:06] existing monetary
[04:09] system and what would now happen if like
[04:13] um I mean it's a c experiment and it
[04:15] probably will not happen but uh all of
[04:17] the governments decide on the world like
[04:19] let's stop all the money printers let's
[04:21] just like stop uh grading more depth and
[04:25] they have so much depth so they kind of
[04:27] have to repay it but they have to pay to
[04:30] themselves or future Generations like
[04:32] what would happen to uh if the Federal
[04:35] Reserve all of the sudden says no more
[04:37] money issuing no more money printing uh
[04:40] nothing gets out
[04:42] there yeah well you can see what's so as
[04:44] they start to Titan you could see what's
[04:46] happening right now in China and you
[04:48] have a deflationary spiral right
[04:50] yesterday stock prices fell 8% before
[04:53] they essentially shut down markets and
[04:55] stopped the prices from falling because
[04:57] they would have kept falling um and and
[05:00] now today they're talking about what
[05:02] type of stimulus they're going to do
[05:04] essentially what type of monetary easing
[05:06] are they going to do because if you
[05:09] forget not not just it's not just stop
[05:13] printing it's Stop Printing at an
[05:15] exponential pace so if any length of
[05:19] time goes on where they contract money
[05:22] supply and and fiscal stimulus and so if
[05:25] you just the whole stack I'm not going
[05:27] to get stuck in one kind of round and
[05:29] Circle but all of the uh all of the um
[05:33] if if you contracted money supply or
[05:36] kept it even for any length of
[05:39] time and the market is naturally
[05:43] deflationary then the hold that rate
[05:45] resets because you have to first you
[05:48] have to first understand how big the
[05:49] debt problem is the debt problem
[05:51] globally uh is is $400 trillion
[05:55] approximately $400 trillion and if you
[05:58] tried to pay back that to a dollar a
[05:59] second it would take 12, 873,000 years
[06:03] to pay back but remember and this is key
[06:07] key key to remember when people say
[06:11] growth productivity growth is more
[06:16] deflationary so when people are saying
[06:19] growth you just in your head say wait
[06:22] that makes things cheaper faster and
[06:25] makes the debt reset
[06:28] faster so
[06:30] let's use let's use this example on
[06:32] Riverside for a second if the company is
[06:34] making very little money right and all
[06:37] of the money that serviced the debt used
[06:38] to come from a whole bunch of jobs
[06:42] across the industry and FL flights to
[06:44] places to meet people and all of the
[06:46] media landscape that used
[06:49] to used to create this and all and and
[06:52] it could only touch very few
[06:54] people um then all of that Co all of
[06:57] that expense kind of that grow growth
[07:00] pays back the debt now you take what's
[07:03] happening today and the total sum of all
[07:06] of that that Med uh that the dollars to
[07:08] be that and that's just one industry
[07:11] that touches way more people is a
[07:13] fraction of what it
[07:15] was and so so the so it it falls in
[07:19] price and the debt becomes uh unre unrep
[07:23] because you have little only a very
[07:25] little bit of money to pay back the debt
[07:28] now
[07:30] and how can we now transition like if we
[07:34] have this abundant future where we are
[07:36] living in a Bitcoin or sound money
[07:38] system where uh we don't have this
[07:41] inflationary system um like now we are
[07:44] in an extremely inflationary system and
[07:47] uh how can we come there and like do you
[07:51] have like a timeline uh for for this I
[07:54] guess it's really hard to predict I'm
[07:57] I'm asked this all the time and it is
[07:59] probably the um the timeline's right now
[08:03] right so if you're living in Bitcoin
[08:05] what you know so I'm I suspect Robin you
[08:08] you are you're living mostly in
[08:11] Bitcoin I have since 2021 uh everything
[08:15] that I own is in Bitcoin yeah so you're
[08:18] Robin you're already living in this
[08:19] system right and in in your world like
[08:23] mine all prices are falling forever like
[08:26] so so it I use this example often but my
[08:30] house that used to be $1.4 million is is
[08:34] now 2.1 million in Canadian dollars in
[08:38] measured in Bitcoin in the same time
[08:40] frame was 300 Bitcoin and now it's uh 35
[08:43] Bitcoin and in four years from now I
[08:47] suspect my house will be worth 3.5
[08:50] Bitcoin and so if you do run that
[08:52] economic calculation I asked myself in
[08:56] fact here's a really funny story I had
[08:58] this this convers ation uh on the
[09:01] weekend with some with a friend very
[09:05] wealthy very uh who couldn't understand
[09:08] Bitcoin and a long time ago I did a
[09:11] lightning transaction to him so I said
[09:14] just pull up your wallet he goes oh I
[09:16] haven't been in it in a long time um and
[09:19] uh he goes I remember you gave me $10 it
[09:22] was really simple but uh and and and I
[09:25] said okay just pull up your wallet and
[09:26] it's
[09:27] $50 um and uh and and he was and I said
[09:32] now just imagine will all of your prices
[09:35] of food and housing and have everything
[09:38] gone up if you measured in this if you
[09:40] just put more of your wealth in this at
[09:42] the same time every price would have
[09:44] gone down and it finally clicked for him
[09:46] what was happening and so he was
[09:48] measuring through the system that was
[09:50] stealing his money um instead of the
[09:53] system that was not um and and that
[09:57] that's pretty profound because it it
[10:00] means all over the world anyone in
[10:03] anyone can move their time and energy to
[10:06] the new system and as they do the
[10:09] acceleration of that time frame happens
[10:11] faster so there's a lot of people right
[10:13] now who don't do what you do who don't
[10:15] do what I do in other words they're
[10:17] still spending their
[10:19] energy in the Fiat
[10:21] system um and they're making the Fiat
[10:24] system stronger right they're fighting
[10:27] with everything they have and even some
[10:28] of the ones are hedged they think
[10:30] they're hedged okay well I have 5% of of
[10:34] my money over in Bitcoin so I'm okay
[10:37] they don't realize they're actually
[10:38] making the system stronger with their
[10:42] actions and their time inside the system
[10:45] that is actually stealing everybody's
[10:47] time so so what what drives the time
[10:50] frame drives the time frame is every one
[10:52] of us understanding it and moving our
[10:55] time into something that is valuable and
[10:57] giving us back our time interesting I I
[11:00] always make the uh the example with the
[11:03] street like Bitcoin if you're on a
[11:04] Bitcoin standard you're like running on
[11:06] a solid Street uh which is not giving in
[11:09] and if you're like on a fat standard
[11:11] it's like you're running on Sand you're
[11:13] still running you're still earning money
[11:15] you can still kind of live it depends on
[11:18] what kind of sand you're living in um
[11:21] and when I think about like the whole
[11:23] game theory and the the ones who adopt
[11:26] Bitcoin first is like the ones that
[11:29] benefit from it the most because they
[11:32] were early adopters uh but at the same
[11:34] time it also benefits the the ones that
[11:37] are critical thinking and they are doing
[11:40] like the the hard work and the the brave
[11:42] work before the other ones but then I
[11:45] also think of like uh what if China or
[11:49] like a really big state decides to print
[11:51] a bunch of money and make war on the
[11:55] countries and uh the institutions that
[11:58] in adopt the Bitcoin standard to like
[12:01] trying to fight the the switch to like a
[12:04] sound money system what what do you
[12:05] think of the whole game theory thought
[12:09] yeah so let's run let's run through some
[12:11] of these examples because because I and
[12:14] and that's why I have a hard so I I
[12:16] think you know the answer but you're
[12:18] doing this for your audience right so so
[12:21] let's imagine um you have 20% people on
[12:26] bitcoin let's say a country is on
[12:27] bitcoin and another
[12:29] is printing money printing
[12:31] money what would happen to the currency
[12:34] that's printing money devalued really
[12:35] fast what would happen with Bitcoin
[12:37] measuring that currency shw up measure
[12:40] the exactly so so you and again all of
[12:43] the these things come from measuring
[12:45] Bitcoin from the system that's debasing
[12:48] and use this ex use this example so the
[12:50] US is losing value as well it's just not
[12:54] losing value as rest as fast as the rest
[12:56] of the currencies on the planet so if
[12:58] you could could um if you could if you
[13:01] were in
[13:03] Venezuela and you
[13:05] could um come in and and invest in
[13:08] Google in
[13:09] 2000 right and trade your dollars for uh
[13:13] for for something it's cash flow was
[13:15] going to be in US
[13:18] Dollars seems like a pretty good trade
[13:20] right you're taking a dollar you know is
[13:22] going to lose value really quickly into
[13:25] something that's going to hold its value
[13:27] relative to the Venezuelan dollar and um
[13:32] and into a company that's going to
[13:33] increase its value to society from that
[13:36] from that trade and the cash flows are
[13:37] going to be denominated in in in the in
[13:39] the US currency so you actually have a
[13:42] double win you're outside of your
[13:43] existing currency and you're in inside a
[13:46] a company that's creating uh cash
[13:49] flows um in in in a more stable currency
[13:54] now do that same economic calculation
[13:57] right now from any currency on the
[13:59] planet into
[14:00] Bitcoin and then some of the companies
[14:03] that are growing on top of
[14:05] Bitcoin that's what's happening and so
[14:08] we're so early in this peer-to-peer
[14:11] internet that's emerging on top of
[14:13] Bitcoin that that's actually an
[14:15] opportunity right now and that's exactly
[14:16] what's happening and Bitcoin is it
[14:19] doesn't matter what currency you're
[14:21] you're talking about and it doesn't
[14:22] actually matter what you what any
[14:25] government does because they can't st
[14:27] stop if it um I'm going to back up if it
[14:31] wasn't decentralized and
[14:33] secure then then governments could stop
[14:36] it and they could stop and and they
[14:37] could stop it and so the the key Bitcoin
[14:40] is more decentralized and secure every
[14:42] single year
[14:43] from from from the Gen Genesis block to
[14:49] to today and it continues to get so more
[14:52] decentralized and secure at the B base
[14:55] layer and so the amount of what that
[14:58] would have to to look like on an attack
[15:00] it just makes it unfeasible it's not
[15:02] it's not able to be
[15:04] broken so if it stays decentralized and
[15:07] secure and I always say if because then
[15:10] people will do their own homework to
[15:12] understand what we're saying and they go
[15:15] deeper if it if it remains decentralized
[15:18] and secure in history through all of our
[15:21] history books have never had something
[15:23] that was decentralized and
[15:24] secure then two things have to happen
[15:28] all of our history books on what money
[15:31] has to look like what political systems
[15:34] need to look like on top of that broken
[15:36] money with an error code that if you
[15:39] could control the money you steal the
[15:43] productivity at a certain rate of all of
[15:46] society and transfer it to yourself so
[15:50] you know for sure throughout human
[15:52] history people will do that because
[15:54] greed will take over if you could break
[15:56] it you would and there was never
[15:58] something like Bitcoin that was
[15:59] decentralized and secure and the winners
[16:02] write the history books then that what
[16:05] when that means all of our history has
[16:07] this broken this flaw in the data and
[16:11] all of our constructs for how we
[16:13] organize Society including all of
[16:16] Economics is based on that flaw in the
[16:19] data and that and that construct and
[16:21] then you had a discovery Bitcoin that
[16:24] was the first time in history that you
[16:26] could ever have something decentralized
[16:28] in secure without an
[16:30] institution for trust completely
[16:34] headless so if that's true it would
[16:38] change everything it would change the
[16:40] future because it actually doesn't care
[16:42] it doesn't care what I think about it
[16:44] you think about it doesn't care about um
[16:47] what governments think about it doesn't
[16:49] care it just imposes a new discipline on
[16:52] the world and it's an honest Ledger and
[16:55] that imposition of that every 10 minute
[16:59] block being the
[17:01] truth um changes all of the future and
[17:05] all of our constructs what we think
[17:07] about politics economics everything else
[17:09] because it's imposing that discipline
[17:12] one of the things it means is
[17:15] forever all prices will fall against
[17:17] Bitcoin forever yeah I like the the Euro
[17:21] chart reversed like usually people are
[17:24] typing in in Google Bitcoin Euro or
[17:26] Bitcoin US dollar and then this see
[17:28] Bitcoin Rising but it's actually really
[17:30] cool if you just flip that and you see
[17:32] how everything and all the currencies
[17:35] and you can even do that with like
[17:37] stocks and stuff like that and there's
[17:39] like rarely an asset that can even keep
[17:42] up over short amount of time no matter
[17:44] like if you look at 10 years and I think
[17:47] the same will happen decades uh to come
[17:49] because Bitcoin is that secure uh sound
[17:53] money system can I just say something
[17:54] it's it's not even I think it's
[17:57] inevitable it's it's so if it stays
[18:01] decentral decentralized and secure
[18:04] nothing will stop that from happening
[18:07] nothing the only and that's actually why
[18:10] for me I've done so much work to to can
[18:13] it stay decentralize and secure now I
[18:15] know what governments will do and some
[18:16] will say well I'm going to make self-
[18:18] custodial illegal and I'm going to do
[18:20] this to try to capture it to to try to
[18:23] create the same monetary standard we
[18:25] have today that's controlled by a few at
[18:28] the top
[18:28] I know that that I know all of the games
[18:31] that will be played to try to do that
[18:33] and that's why I'm very confident it's
[18:36] going to stay decentralized and secure
[18:38] but assuming that is true it doesn't
[18:41] matter none of the noise matters at all
[18:45] it's repricing everything I love how you
[18:48] you you think about Bitcoin and then all
[18:50] the um implications and the really
[18:53] simple examples that U um show that and
[18:57] how did like your entrepreneurial uh
[19:01] background and your like life experience
[19:04] uh and you say like you know what what
[19:06] the governments will do and stuff like
[19:07] that how did this all like influence
[19:09] that and what like what learnings did
[19:12] you get from uh the pre- Bitcoin uh or
[19:16] pre uh that time whether Jeff poof that
[19:20] uh fought in the in the early days oh
[19:23] inflation is good oh we need soft money
[19:26] like how did this all change and how did
[19:28] your learnings of the life go into what
[19:31] what we just discussed the last like 20
[19:33] minutes yeah well I'll say from an
[19:36] entrepreneur what you end up doing is
[19:40] you see an Insight that other people
[19:43] don't see with technology or something
[19:46] and the world doesn't see what you see
[19:49] and you go where the future is going to
[19:52] be not where it is now and you go and
[19:55] create um something that you think is
[19:58] going to deliver tons of value now
[20:00] remember when you do that most people
[20:02] are living in a different world they
[20:03] don't see the future you see so it's a
[20:06] it's it's excruciating because both you
[20:09] could be totally wrong you could be
[20:11] crazy right but you think you're right
[20:14] and then if you're if you can create
[20:16] something that the world doesn't see and
[20:18] the further ahead of that you are the
[20:20] less people see so raising Capital into
[20:22] that is hard understanding where the um
[20:25] and so so I've lived my life
[20:28] doing that and understanding that
[20:31] calculation right and anybody who funds
[20:33] you is also betting on your Bel ability
[20:37] to essentially Bend reality where you
[20:39] think it's moving to now now the war of
[20:43] that how many things you learn about
[20:45] yourself and how many mistakes you make
[20:48] and I'll say one of the my biggest
[20:51] things was it was never outside of me
[20:54] but I always thought it was outside of
[20:56] me I thought it was so sometimes
[20:58] um you would blame this event on
[21:01] something else it was always internal it
[21:04] was um and so sometimes I was early
[21:07] sometimes I was but um and timing plays
[21:10] a huge role in this but tons of lessons
[21:14] on the way through there and I and and
[21:16] I've just always been curious I've been
[21:18] curious about okay where do I make
[21:20] mistakes and and when I see that and and
[21:24] the pattern keeps
[21:25] repeating I know it's me not instead of
[21:28] the world and so it's just driven a deep
[21:31] deep curiosity about a whole bunch of
[21:33] things and I I read I I read about 50
[21:38] books a year and I have for 35 years
[21:42] more than that um so I don't even know I
[21:45] can't even say where does the knowledge
[21:47] come from because people impact you in
[21:50] ways and every different discussion
[21:52] impacts you in ways that you can't even
[21:54] tell for sure was that my original
[21:57] thought or or did I did it come into my
[21:59] Consciousness from somebody else and
[22:01] then I refined it further um and created
[22:06] something but once you have broad broad
[22:09] different various ideas from lots of
[22:12] different things and you're really
[22:13] curious then your mind picks up on
[22:16] patterns
[22:17] faster and and I I would say if I if I
[22:21] said from what we're talking about here
[22:24] what I would say a general um conclusion
[22:27] that I can draw from all of this
[22:29] experience is most people don't predict
[22:32] the future they predict the present
[22:35] forward and and to predict the future
[22:38] you have to look at what has changed
[22:41] right and then you have to say is that
[22:43] change stable like in what we're talking
[22:45] about in Bitcoin that change is a change
[22:48] we've never seen before so I can
[22:50] understand if if we've never seen
[22:52] something like Bitcoin and it that
[22:54] change that Discovery is so great I can
[22:58] understand why people would not trust
[23:00] it but I can't understand why people
[23:03] wouldn't be curious about it right
[23:05] because if it if it if it's that bar
[23:08] then it demands curiosity to say because
[23:11] this what I did I want to try to
[23:13] disprove that
[23:15] thought and then if it is true if it is
[23:18] that great a change like the internet
[23:20] was before it right if it was that great
[23:22] a
[23:24] change then going forward all things
[23:27] would be so I don't look from here going
[23:30] forward I look from what this means
[23:34] going
[23:35] backwards because because what what ends
[23:37] up happening is most people can't
[23:39] because the change is so great they
[23:41] carry all of their baggage from one
[23:43] system into the new system and you know
[23:46] I wrote about this and this like
[23:47] Blockbuster putting candy aisles in
[23:49] their
[23:50] stores right or or what what monopolies
[23:54] do from the old system to try to protect
[23:56] the old Monopoly they do tinkering
[23:59] around the
[24:00] edges um and it's already over and what
[24:03] I would say in Bitcoin it time frame all
[24:06] depends on how many of us understand it
[24:07] and how many of us move our time and how
[24:09] fast we do it because the faster more
[24:12] people move their time the faster the
[24:13] time frame but but I can say this it's
[24:17] already
[24:18] inevitable it's going to happen it's
[24:20] like um uh some sometimes thr that
[24:23] comparison like watching last last
[24:25] night's game with knowing who won
[24:30] it's but the only thing different is
[24:32] like watching last night's game with
[24:35] knowing who won does not make fun and I
[24:37] think being in Bitcoin still makes a lot
[24:40] of
[24:41] fun yeah ex it's so much fun because and
[24:44] then you're meeting people that are
[24:46] already living there and they're not
[24:48] scared of the rest of everything else
[24:50] and so I actually see a level of
[24:53] Consciousness Rising like people's lives
[24:55] are getting dramatically better in this
[24:58] the amount of emails I get per day about
[25:00] people that people that have reached is
[25:03] so touching that I've changed their life
[25:05] and like literally changes their life
[25:07] because their perspective has changed
[25:09] they're hopeful they um that translates
[25:12] into their families their translates
[25:14] into their businesses and everything
[25:16] else and when you're hopeful and you're
[25:17] moving from
[25:20] Fear um and nihilism because of that
[25:23] fear from uh from what what you were
[25:25] living in to
[25:28] hope um your life just changes because
[25:31] you are the change you can create
[25:33] anything you want and so as you move to
[25:35] more of your time with a whole bunch of
[25:38] other people that are aligned to that
[25:40] same truth right all it is is a honest
[25:43] Ledger it's more than that but it's an
[25:45] honest Ledger it's it's going to be the
[25:48] new peer-to-peer internet bounded by
[25:50] energy but it's an honest Ledger As you
[25:52] move into truth and you see that and all
[25:55] of the other people who understand what
[25:56] you do what I do do you see it
[25:59] everywhere and you see this incredible
[26:03] future rolling out across uh across the
[26:06] planet and you're just wanting more
[26:07] people to
[26:09] understand that they themselves don't
[26:12] have to wait for their government to his
[26:14] approval they don't have to wait for a
[26:16] large corporation to say it's okay they
[26:19] can front run it all and change their
[26:22] and and change their entire perspective
[26:25] on their life so it's it's pretty it's
[26:27] really powerful
[26:28] all and and when we like move further in
[26:32] the future where like Bitcoin is like
[26:35] the standard um unit of account medium
[26:38] of Exchange store of value of of our um
[26:42] generation of our like living um what
[26:46] what is changing on like the
[26:49] entrepreneurial Spirit uh compared to
[26:52] like right right now like four 10 years
[26:55] ago so um nothing it
[27:00] accelerates um the and that acceleration
[27:05] is in service of all of us and so for
[27:08] for your new listeners there is no such
[27:11] thing and this is going to be hard for
[27:12] them to understand because if they're
[27:14] living in a Fiat construct they're
[27:15] carrying all the bag their baggage
[27:17] forward so they're going to wonder how
[27:18] debt operates how um how how I buy a
[27:22] house without realizing that the price
[27:25] of the house today holds a mon AR
[27:27] premium because people store their
[27:29] wealth there because if they stored it
[27:32] in the bank it loses value so and then
[27:35] and then then they have to have a house
[27:37] with a staggering mortgage just to try
[27:40] to get into the game and all of that is
[27:43] stealing their time and energy to
[27:44] support the existing system whereas in
[27:46] the new system the house just keeps on
[27:48] falling in press forever to to its
[27:52] utility value and the utility value then
[27:54] Falls because the utility uh utility
[27:57] value of a house um it doesn't hold a
[28:00] monetary premium anymore it doesn't it's
[28:02] not a store of
[28:03] value right because Bitcoin becomes a
[28:05] better store of value and so as prices
[28:08] fall relative relative to bitcoin you
[28:10] need way less debt to service
[28:12] it and and so that's just one example
[28:15] but political systems we don't have a
[28:18] political system in this in this world
[28:21] in this construct that could accurately
[28:24] describe what Bitcoin gives
[28:26] us because all of these communism
[28:30] Marxism
[28:33] totalitarianism capitalism even
[28:35] capitalism it's based on the a free
[28:38] market the idea behind capitalism is a
[28:40] free market but we know we don't live in
[28:42] a free market at all it's captured by
[28:44] money manipulated money we know we don't
[28:47] live in a democracy because you have no
[28:50] vote in how much money is stolen from
[28:53] you each year through inflation and
[28:55] remember it's not inflation from zero to
[28:57] 5 or 10% is inflation from what the
[29:01] natural rate of deflation should be and
[29:03] today if the natural rate of deflation
[29:05] is should be negative
[29:07] 5% then then if your if your inflation
[29:11] rate is 10% you're getting your pocket
[29:14] picked by 15% a year
[29:16] compounded and so so and people don't
[29:19] realize that because they're measuring
[29:21] from zero and they think oh 2% inflation
[29:24] is okay well why is 2% theft okay
[29:28] especially it's not 2% it's a lot
[29:30] greater than that because we
[29:33] already we already know the natural
[29:36] state of a free market is deflationary
[29:39] and that means every construct we have
[29:41] here every construct of Economics most
[29:44] people are so confused about economics
[29:46] and they it's designed to be confusing
[29:49] to be able to mask that that that money
[29:53] is
[29:54] stolen because here's how here's how
[29:56] simple economics is we want to trade
[29:59] with people all over the world we want
[30:02] we want
[30:03] value um and the natural the natural
[30:06] output of that trade is deflation
[30:09] because people compete to give us more
[30:11] value that's economics that's it
[30:14] everything else everything else you hear
[30:17] is nonsense I'm super excited to
[30:19] announce that this podcast got the first
[30:23] ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[30:27] from day one and they teach and preach
[30:30] self- custody this is my goto exchange
[30:33] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[30:36] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[30:38] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[30:41] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[30:44] this podcast use code Robin and click
[30:46] the link in the description when I hear
[30:49] this it's like so interesting for me
[30:51] because um it also speaks to like it's
[30:55] you have to unlearn a lot of things
[30:57] things that you learn through your life
[30:59] and um maybe like quick out quick um
[31:03] story from my orange buing moment I was
[31:06] three years uh of the opinion that I
[31:11] that Bitcoin is a scam and uh asset
[31:14] needs a cash flow like I was on in that
[31:16] stock investors mindset in in one buffet
[31:18] mindset and I had a discussion with a
[31:21] friend uh and he and I just discovered
[31:24] that I kind kind of ran out of arguments
[31:26] against Bitcoin and then uh I wanted to
[31:31] go into Bitcoin really deep uh and was
[31:35] like I want to prove him wrong like I
[31:37] wanted to prove my friend wrong and I
[31:41] started this journey on a Friday and I
[31:43] was like okay this weekend I have
[31:44] nothing planned I will say no to every
[31:46] friend and I will just dive into deep
[31:47] Bitcoin and then on Monday I will call
[31:49] him and say why he's an
[31:51] idiot and in this weekend I discovered
[31:54] that oh maybe I am wrong and on
[31:57] Monday I opened my coinbase account and
[32:00] bought my my first Bitcoin uh with with
[32:03] with that uh and it's it speaks also I
[32:07] think to The Humbling moments especially
[32:08] when you first discover Bitcoin and I
[32:11] think you also talk about like uh your
[32:13] companies also called egoa Capital uh
[32:16] you talk about how Bitcoin kills your
[32:19] ego and how it humbles you and I think
[32:22] that's that's an an an amazing uh thing
[32:25] is that by eodf capital is called ego
[32:28] def Capital right yeah that's the idea
[32:31] behind it and that came and my Partners
[32:33] came up with that and but uh but exactly
[32:36] the the death of the ego to be able to
[32:39] understand that that and it's related
[32:42] far more than just Bitcoin but Bitcoin I
[32:45] think actually drives that along and the
[32:48] output of that is a higher Consciousness
[32:50] in society I think is what what's what
[32:52] we're going to see and and it creates um
[32:56] and when you can really do that actually
[32:58] when yours yours is a very good story
[33:00] because because I think I think what is
[33:02] polarizing for Bitcoin is somebody
[33:05] didn't understand it somebody didn't
[33:07] understand it didn't understand it and
[33:08] then they get it and then they believe
[33:11] that everybody else should get it like
[33:13] that and they're yelling at everybody
[33:15] else and they drive them further and
[33:17] further away and we have to realize you
[33:19] almost have to meet people where they
[33:20] are not where you are because because it
[33:23] seems like such a such a stretch it's
[33:26] the first time in history it's the first
[33:28] time ever that we've had something like
[33:30] this so it would um and then if there
[33:33] first time ever that we've had something
[33:35] like this and the control
[33:38] structure it destroys the control
[33:40] structure and the manipulation of money
[33:42] that acrs to the to the wealthiest and
[33:44] the people in control to uh today and
[33:47] and the three-letter word agencies if it
[33:50] takes all of that ill gotten gains that
[33:53] funds war and everything else and read
[33:56] it distributes it to Society at
[33:59] large then those then then those
[34:03] agencies and everything else would have
[34:05] something they would try everything to
[34:06] attack it if those agencies are embedded
[34:11] with our news
[34:12] today and they're embedded and and they
[34:15] can essentially bribe different money
[34:18] and and through through money to be able
[34:21] to infiltrate organizations and
[34:24] everything else in in in inside of this
[34:27] then you would expect that all of the
[34:29] people you know are mostly looking
[34:31] through the system of
[34:33] misinformation trying to convince them
[34:35] how scary this new system is so I
[34:38] totally I have empathy for the people
[34:40] that are stuck there because they if
[34:42] you're watching regular mainstream news
[34:45] you're inside the system of control all
[34:47] of the fights within that system are
[34:51] designed to keep the system
[34:54] intact right the left right all of this
[34:57] is within the system trying to drive it
[35:01] more into the system it's all um because
[35:04] you can't change a system from a system
[35:07] so all these things are um are are are
[35:12] are kind of stealing more and more of
[35:14] your energy because of fear right um
[35:18] whatever side of a conflict you're on
[35:20] whatever side of a debate here on um
[35:23] driving more and more uh fear that is
[35:28] is that Bitcoin thing oh those are those
[35:31] just those crazy people right and you
[35:34] stay stuck in your a second your Silo of
[35:37] fear so I completely understand it and
[35:39] then you have a whole bunch of
[35:40] bitcoiners who have already seen this
[35:42] tried to disprove it been over there and
[35:45] forgotten that just two years ago just
[35:48] one year ago just six months ago they
[35:49] were one of the
[35:50] others so um I just I find the whole
[35:54] thing
[35:55] fascinating yeah it's interesting ing
[35:57] how it it develops always and um I when
[36:02] I started out with Bitcoin I wanted to
[36:03] tell everybody like I wanted to be like
[36:05] onim Miss and and and and turn around
[36:08] all my family members turns out most are
[36:11] not that interested in it or I'm not
[36:14] that good in explaining it uh and I
[36:17] switch to
[36:18] the strategy or like I switch just my
[36:22] life that I'm like searching a Channel
[36:24] online where I can just put out what I
[36:27] think and also with that all my friends
[36:29] and family see that online and the
[36:32] interesting thing that happens is that
[36:34] the people that are actually interested
[36:35] in it or like oh that's that's an
[36:37] interesting F and I also clip out the
[36:39] podcast with small Snippets and post it
[36:42] all over my social media so like they
[36:44] because it's really hard for people to
[36:46] watch like a one hour thing about
[36:50] Bitcoin when they're not even interested
[36:52] in it but maybe they see like 10 seconds
[36:54] on Instagram feet and it some
[36:57] curiosity and I I saw that and people
[36:59] are coming to me and like oh what this
[37:02] this where can I find more information
[37:04] then I have some sources I can uh give
[37:07] to them and that's a way more effective
[37:10] way if if if they have some interest
[37:12] some level of like oh I want to know
[37:15] about what's what's going on there yeah
[37:18] and that's it the the and that spark I I
[37:22] think about almost as a prism and or as
[37:25] you first find what through it what
[37:28] you're interested in right and there's
[37:31] all of these different whether it's Game
[37:33] Theory whether it's deflation whether
[37:35] it's you find the thing that cracks the
[37:38] cracks this veil of of this world that
[37:41] you live in that pulls you in to say
[37:44] wait there's something here that solves
[37:45] this problem and then as you go deeper
[37:47] and deeper you realize it solves all of
[37:49] the other problems too right and so when
[37:52] you're talking about this to somebody
[37:54] else it's really I I when I when I think
[37:57] about it I
[37:59] just look at it inversely what is their
[38:03] problem what is the thing that they care
[38:05] about all the time then I try to get
[38:07] them to try to solve it through the
[38:10] existing Fiat lens and then they realize
[38:12] huh it's impossible and then they're
[38:15] more open um talking about feat and I
[38:17] think this will be um a good point now
[38:20] to start uh I asked like I think two
[38:23] hours ago on on on Twitter uh and I got
[38:26] actually a lot of responses that I
[38:28] interview now in in two hours and uh
[38:30] there's like one hour window where
[38:32] people can ask questions and there was
[38:35] like uh two interesting questions in
[38:38] there the first one is like how long can
[38:41] feed survive and the more interesting
[38:44] part of the question is like will
[38:46] Bitcoin extend or shorten the time that
[38:51] feat is around if it's not surviving for
[38:55] long he can survive for a long time it
[38:58] can it's a um the best way to say it is
[39:01] it can survive as long as people keep
[39:03] giving it
[39:04] power um and what we're discussing right
[39:06] now on 99% of the planet is still giving
[39:09] it power like it controls them and is
[39:12] and it only gains its power from
[39:14] extracting it from them so until that
[39:17] flips it can survive for a long time um
[39:20] and if I would say the the high highest
[39:25] probabilities of what this looks like is
[39:28] is Wars expanding Wars um um you've
[39:33] you've reached almost
[39:36] uh a Nash equilibrium you have with
[39:39] nuclear Powers right that that won't
[39:43] press the button because because you
[39:46] could end all most of life on the the
[39:48] planet and and that's kind of but now
[39:51] other nations are developing nuclear
[39:53] Powers too and you back one of those
[39:55] into a corner to too far and that could
[39:58] happen that could escalate so I'm I'm
[39:59] just talking about the probabilities
[40:02] from the existing system as this
[40:04] existing system
[40:06] deteriorates you also have artificial
[40:08] intelligence moving at an exponential
[40:11] rate and remember the artificial
[40:12] intelligence is moving at the exact same
[40:14] rate since the 50s it's just been an
[40:17] exponential and people are measuring it
[40:19] linearly so they couldn't see the movie
[40:22] unfold so so they're they're watching a
[40:25] frame of the movie
[40:27] instead of the entire movie and so if
[40:29] you're watching the actual movie and how
[40:30] fast it moves from here you see a
[40:32] totally different thing now to take that
[40:34] into drones and Robotics and everything
[40:37] else and and all of those prices meaning
[40:39] in your backyard you could create a
[40:41] drone weapon and or a swarm of Dr
[40:44] weapons for almost no cost AI enhance
[40:47] that could digitally T Target people
[40:49] anywhere and this is coming so it's
[40:52] going to change Warfare in a crazy way
[40:54] and it's on the verge of of doing that
[40:56] right now and it and in a year from now
[41:00] year and a half from now it'll be so
[41:02] much more pervasive so meaning if you're
[41:05] concentrating control up and
[41:07] manipulating money well technology is
[41:10] doing this more and more people are so
[41:14] mad at this system that they create
[41:17] these things and they create and more
[41:18] countries so mad at the system trying to
[41:21] that they this is going to expand
[41:24] conflict everywhere that is
[41:26] unfortunately probability of where we're
[41:28] going and then that'll drag more of us
[41:32] not probably not bitcoiners but more
[41:34] more people saying how dare they en amp
[41:38] up right and so so and it'll keep this
[41:41] system intact because that's the system
[41:43] demands it it has to create other
[41:46] enemies for you to steal to to to have
[41:49] your time sucked into this and your fear
[41:52] or or anger will keep you it will keep
[41:55] you in
[41:57] it so that's this system it's already
[42:00] unstable the only reason the only way it
[42:02] can do this is more and more
[42:05] increasing fear-based control-based
[42:08] mechanisms that steal remove individual
[42:10] rights and freedoms unfortunately that's
[42:12] what it looks like so you can just say
[42:15] at the same time technology is making
[42:16] that happen and Bitcoin is moving the
[42:18] other other
[42:19] way hope truth abundance
[42:23] expanding and and the fight we are all
[42:26] in Liv in the real fight we're all
[42:27] living in the actual one is which world
[42:29] do we want to live in and if we want to
[42:32] live on in on the one that that is a
[42:34] base layer of truth that offers hope and
[42:37] abundance to
[42:39] society then we need to move more of our
[42:41] time into it and so it's easy to be a
[42:44] bitcoiner and tell what everybody else
[42:46] should do but start as a bitcoiner
[42:49] moving more of your time into it and and
[42:53] and by moving more of your time into it
[42:55] you'll see see everything expand like I
[42:58] I say all all the time I can't believe
[43:01] what I get to do I cannot believe it I
[43:03] pinch myself what I get to see the most
[43:07] brilliant entrepreneurs on this planet
[43:10] building on this all on a truthful layer
[43:14] that are not going anywhere they're
[43:16] expanding and their lives are changing
[43:17] and their their are CH because they're
[43:19] delivering value to other people at a
[43:21] crazy rate I get to be involved in this
[43:24] I actually just I cannot believe I have
[43:26] so so much gratitude for what uh for
[43:29] what I get to do and so that world is
[43:31] expanding how long can Fe it stay uh
[43:34] stay how bad does this get through it it
[43:37] all depends on the rate of more people
[43:40] moving over moving more of their time
[43:42] and energy over and and when things are
[43:46] happening that are terrible out of this
[43:48] system that I can't change they're going
[43:51] to happen it not co-opting
[43:54] you into to it not pulling you back into
[43:58] it that you you're spending your energy
[44:00] creating the world that you want to
[44:01] create and uh I think an amazing view on
[44:04] that as you said uh you're working uh in
[44:07] the Bitcoin field so deep and you're
[44:10] involved with so many companies and
[44:12] projects um like I think it would be an
[44:16] a long task to list them all and what
[44:18] you're doing and where are you involved
[44:21] but maybe like what's the the most
[44:23] exciting thing you currently uh working
[44:26] on and what's what's like the plan uh
[44:29] for you and uh going forward what you
[44:31] want to achieve for like the next five
[44:34] 10 20 years so the thesis of the fund
[44:37] ego death Capital was was
[44:39] effectively um and and it came and and
[44:43] honestly it came from me being a
[44:47] hypocrite um and and this same
[44:50] conversation I saw it in myself and when
[44:52] I see something in myself you asked the
[44:54] entrepreneurial Journey right right same
[44:57] thing here same thing here when I see
[44:59] something that that I'm acting not
[45:02] congruent with what I
[45:04] say it it creates the
[45:07] a I have to solve that I have to solve
[45:10] that Paradox I have in myself it's and
[45:14] and and so I had a hedge my I I wrote
[45:18] the book price of tomorrow I knew where
[45:20] this was going I investigated thoroughly
[45:23] the existing system and I realized
[45:26] couldn't
[45:27] transition to the world that people
[45:29] would want to live in from that system
[45:31] the system problem so great a system
[45:34] can't a system can't change the system
[45:37] it has to be you have to have a new
[45:38] system imposing a new system and to be
[45:41] able to build a bridge to the other side
[45:43] so I knew this then I investigated
[45:45] Bitcoin kind of as I was writing the
[45:47] book I'd already bought a little bit but
[45:50] uh but I really started investigating as
[45:52] I wrote the book um and and started
[45:56] doing more work and even at the end of
[45:58] that I probably had a kind of in my own
[46:00] mind this wasn't true for Bitcoin but in
[46:03] my own mind I still had a probability of
[46:05] it failing about
[46:08] 5% and so I tried to disprove everything
[46:11] I'm saying here and I tried to and I
[46:13] went down similar to you down to the
[46:15] sand and Bitcoin and every way it could
[46:17] be broken and what would happen and what
[46:19] would if this happened what would happen
[46:21] if this happened what would happen and
[46:22] all of the different attack vectors and
[46:25] I realized
[46:26] it's not Bitcoin it's my own mind that
[46:30] couldn't see how how decentralized and
[46:33] secure it is and how I couldn't believe
[46:35] just like I'm saying to lot I understand
[46:37] why people couldn't I couldn't believe
[46:39] that you could have a discovery like
[46:41] this that that was like this because it
[46:44] never happened before so I had to get
[46:46] comfortable in that and so as I tried to
[46:48] disprove it I did the same thing is you
[46:50] I
[46:51] came U to to understand it at a deeper
[46:55] level and and what um what would happen
[46:57] as a result once I understood that then
[46:59] I put more of my wealth in there and I
[47:02] was on podcast and I was traveling
[47:04] around the world and people were saying
[47:06] oh you're great and everything else and
[47:09] I was still 90% of my time was in the
[47:12] Fiat world and 10% of my time was uh um
[47:15] in Bitcoin and my boards were all in the
[47:17] Fiat world and and and and my advisory
[47:20] work was in in the fat world and and and
[47:23] that and I woke up kind of one day and I
[47:26] went oh my God you you're you're doing
[47:30] this right how could the world
[47:32] change if people that know this are
[47:36] spending 90% of their time in in the
[47:38] Fiat
[47:39] world and so that caused me to want to
[47:42] move all of my time or as much of it as
[47:45] it can onto Bitcoin and what was my
[47:48] highest best use or highest best what am
[47:50] I really good at I'm really good at
[47:54] helping entrepreneurs create the future
[47:56] that they want because I've kind of made
[47:58] so many mistakes on my own way and I see
[48:00] these patterns and so um so helping
[48:04] that's why the Venture Capital fund to
[48:06] be able to invest in the best
[48:08] entrepreneurs creating this and the
[48:09] thesis of that was the thesis of the
[48:13] first fund was this is so early on a new
[48:16] peer-to-peer internet that most people
[48:18] don't even understand the base layer
[48:20] kind of the
[48:22] tcpip the base layer of the new internet
[48:24] would be
[48:26] Bitcoin and so they certainly don't
[48:28] understand what's being built on top and
[48:30] it's really early on all of the layers
[48:32] that are being built on top that are
[48:34] going to transition us faster to this so
[48:37] can we invest in the entrepreneurs that
[48:40] are building the
[48:41] rails that are that that create the
[48:45] acceleration so they allow billions of
[48:47] people to come in to to use this simpler
[48:50] easier more effective uh uh for them um
[48:54] and accelerate
[48:56] what's uh uh what's happening so that
[48:58] was the basis of the first fund it's
[49:00] been incredibly successful and uh we're
[49:04] just in the process of uh raising fund
[49:07] two right now which would be aund
[49:09] million fund um to be able to uh to be
[49:12] able to accelerate it further because at
[49:14] the time when we did it and that's
[49:17] probably part of the reason for a
[49:19] smaller Fund in the beginning the
[49:22] ecosystem wasn't mature enough so we had
[49:24] to help
[49:26] entrepreneurs uh um and and develop
[49:30] where uh where it's moving now and now
[49:32] what's happening is you can see this
[49:34] wall of money starting to understand and
[49:38] this acceleration of some some of these
[49:40] companies crazy acceleration of some of
[49:42] these
[49:43] companies um that provide value to
[49:46] people in a way that's hard to describe
[49:49] so I think an a really good journey to
[49:51] be on and I've I've I'm in similar
[49:53] situation because I worked 40 hours in
[49:56] the fat Tri now turn it down to 25 I'm
[49:58] starting to get my social media presence
[50:01] uh on the off the ground I'm working now
[50:04] with Bitcoin companies uh together uh to
[50:07] make uh to make my time more and more
[50:10] into Bitcoin because at a similar uh at
[50:14] a different stage but a similar um light
[50:16] bu moment where I'm like oh I'm talking
[50:18] a lot about Bitcoin but most of my time
[50:20] is in a normal Fe job so it's that was
[50:23] an interesting Journey for me also by
[50:25] the way that that's the thing that
[50:26] accelerates it so one leg of the stool
[50:28] if you tried
[50:30] to um if you tried to explain tcpip to
[50:34] people most people wouldn't even know
[50:35] what it is but all of the internet
[50:38] relies on that base layer to be able to
[50:42] not fail because otherwise everything on
[50:44] top of it would fail all of the other
[50:46] layers on top of it would fail and so
[50:48] today in Bitcoin people don't even
[50:51] understand Bitcoin the base layer and
[50:52] but that also creates the opportunity so
[50:54] when you think about
[50:56] HTTP on layer 4 in of the internet then
[51:00] bringing in all of the entrepreneurs
[51:02] that created the internet and remember
[51:04] the iPhone was created in 2007 using the
[51:06] same protocol stack those those layers
[51:09] of the
[51:10] internet um you think it's 17 years
[51:13] later the iPhone comes out and we re and
[51:16] wow we can't even imagine what life look
[51:18] like before it right before the smart
[51:21] smartphone but I was part of like early
[51:24] in the internet I UND like it was clunky
[51:28] things didn't work and everything else
[51:29] and the entrepreneurs are building it
[51:31] and then then why I say as you abstract
[51:35] some of these things more and more on a
[51:37] stable
[51:39] Foundation um the value that URS to
[51:43] society is staggering and they can't see
[51:45] it to today so most of the things that
[51:47] give us value right we don't know is on
[51:50] top of a broken monetary
[51:53] system that is EXT rating a whole bunch
[51:56] of value in a different way creating a
[51:58] different um different negative
[52:00] externality when we now marry things
[52:04] that are giving us value that are
[52:07] actually don't have those negative
[52:09] externalities that are
[52:11] restoring um the free market restoring
[52:14] um the power to us it accelerates both
[52:17] but but people won't um in a lot of
[52:20] cases they won't need to understand
[52:21] Bitcoin like you do or I do or anything
[52:23] else they're going to be just getting so
[52:25] much value out of the product or service
[52:28] that you're they're using on top of it
[52:30] that's just going to be a native part of
[52:32] they they don't have to just like they
[52:33] don't they don't do the Deep work on
[52:35] what tcpip is
[52:37] today yeah and I also think a lot about
[52:40] it because when when Bitcoin is that
[52:43] base layer uh of the future Financial
[52:46] like Bitcoin will be the Bas layer of
[52:47] the fut future Financial system uh and
[52:51] uh so many people use like Facebook
[52:54] YouTube and all the internet
[52:55] applications that are above on all the
[52:57] layers but uh probably only like a
[53:01] really really small amount of people on
[53:03] Earth can explain how tcpip the base
[53:05] layer actually works I'm a software
[53:08] engineer and I could not even really
[53:10] explain it well enough for a large
[53:12] audience to to actually understand how
[53:15] the whole internet layer thing works out
[53:18] so I think
[53:20] and maybe like you can give me your
[53:23] thoughts on that I think most people
[53:25] people will never really truly
[53:27] understand Bitcoin but they will still
[53:29] use it exactly so exactly the same now
[53:33] if you want to it just tells you how
[53:35] early we are right now to be able to
[53:37] understand these different layers now in
[53:39] a protocol stock so why is that hard to
[53:42] understand and why do protocols like
[53:43] that take everything why are they win or
[53:45] take all markets um because the protocol
[53:48] is designed to create other value on top
[53:50] of it right and and so today we live on
[53:54] a protocol stack that is largely
[53:58] extractive it the idea of the internet
[54:00] was decentralize everything and create
[54:02] create this but because of the money it
[54:03] turned into an advertising model where
[54:07] where our brains slow down we slow down
[54:10] into a car
[54:12] crash so so how do you sell more more
[54:15] advertising more car
[54:17] crashes because people get sucked into
[54:20] it and so they're trading their most
[54:23] valuable thing in to an algorithm that
[54:26] is more car crashes so that the
[54:29] advertising companies can make more and
[54:30] extract more so they're um they're the
[54:34] product inside this making it more and
[54:36] more stronger and now now it's not just
[54:39] an algorithm now there's these AI models
[54:41] that every single person that's
[54:43] extracting your attention to try to make
[54:45] you stay to sell more
[54:48] advertising Bitcoin because because it's
[54:51] not advertising related it's
[54:52] decentralized and and secure and it
[54:54] doesn't need advertising to be able to
[54:57] uh to drive out it changes that Paradigm
[55:00] as well so you know you probably use
[55:02] Noster as well which is a communication
[55:06] uh platform on top of Bitcoin that that
[55:09] if you take your um it's and its early
[55:12] days but if you take your um if you want
[55:16] a client which would be like Twitter but
[55:19] a whole bunch of different clients if
[55:21] that algorithm you don't like you can
[55:24] take keys and you can move it to a
[55:26] different client and all of your
[55:28] contacts follow you and all of your
[55:30] content follows you and so nobody it's
[55:32] not a wall Garden that is monetizing you
[55:35] by by stealing your attention it's
[55:38] always your content it's always your F
[55:40] followers and so now you have clients
[55:43] competing for you in service to you so
[55:46] they provide more value and if you ever
[55:49] at any time don't like the algorithm
[55:50] it's showing you things you don't like
[55:52] you just move your stuff to a different
[55:53] one um
[55:55] and and it and it competes for you so
[55:57] you have the free
[55:58] market giving that value other things
[56:02] you can
[56:03] do um I pay for most of my
[56:06] coffee through tips that I make in uh in
[56:12] uh in Noster in uh in that because
[56:15] people just because I'll put up a post
[56:17] somebody will give you a thousand SATs
[56:21] or 500 SATs and it's lots of different
[56:23] people do that um and and so what
[56:26] they're saying is I value
[56:28] you and and you've helped me in this way
[56:31] or this post has helped me in this way
[56:33] and there's no it's it's not an
[56:34] advertising generated so while that's
[56:36] still young and while it's still growing
[56:39] you can see all of these things that are
[56:41] restoring our power back to us and what
[56:44] they look and the different business
[56:45] models that emerge out of that and what
[56:47] that looks like and see you can see what
[56:50] could happen or or will happen on a
[56:52] bunch of uh on a bunch of these
[56:55] different Technologies I think the the
[56:58] other thing I just should mention is
[57:00] protocols don't come around very often
[57:02] we're used to looking at new companies
[57:05] or we're look used to looking at in this
[57:08] order new new companies then new
[57:12] technologies and then protocols don't
[57:14] come around very often and they have
[57:16] very interesting characteristics they
[57:18] come in
[57:19] layers each layer has to aify has to
[57:23] harden um and it can't do a whole bunch
[57:26] of things at that layer because if it
[57:28] trades off doing a whole bunch of things
[57:30] at a base
[57:32] layer it risks compromising the Proto
[57:36] the protocol there's just too many
[57:37] attack factors so that's what Bitcoin
[57:40] did it it all it does really well is
[57:42] decentralization and security and is
[57:45] that time chain for each uh uh each each
[57:49] new new block but it does it at the
[57:51] expense of
[57:53] scalability and smart contracts and
[57:55] everything else in the base
[57:57] layer and it oif it gets harder and
[58:01] harder and harder to uh to do that more
[58:03] decentralized more secure and then the
[58:06] next layer Builds on top of it and the
[58:08] same thing happens at the next layer why
[58:11] people misunderstood it so much and went
[58:13] to ethereum and all the other um uh
[58:18] think coins that are going to go to zero
[58:21] is because they miss because protocols
[58:23] don't come around very often and and
[58:25] each layer oif and so now Layer Two and
[58:29] lightning every 10 minutes comes back
[58:32] down to layer one so you have a
[58:34] trade-off for scalability that
[58:36] centralizes lightning a little bit
[58:39] versus layer one and Bitcoin um but by
[58:44] by doing that and and coming back down
[58:46] to layer one every 10 minutes doesn't
[58:48] cental doesn't doesn't risk the whole
[58:51] prodo uh the whole uh stack and so so if
[58:55] that if if those come around very
[58:59] infrequently and they they unlike other
[59:02] things that we see technology or or
[59:04] companies on top of the technology then
[59:07] it would be really easy to misunderstand
[59:09] what's happening because they aify and
[59:11] they take time to develop and you can't
[59:13] see what is possible on the new layer
[59:15] until it's already there and then until
[59:19] entrepreneurs then reach in and develop
[59:22] on top of that new layer applications
[59:25] that change the
[59:27] world yeah like everything will actually
[59:30] be built on top of Bitcoin and yeah it's
[59:35] I had a small phase from like when I
[59:38] started in 2020 and went all in in 20 20
[59:42] 2021 in Bitcoin like there was in that
[59:45] one year experimentation and in in uh
[59:49] ethereum and another really really small
[59:51] token I don't even want to mention it
[59:53] because it's so small what's this
[59:55] realization that Bitcoin and I don't
[59:58] even know where I heard it but Bitcoin
[60:01] because I came from the company mindset
[60:03] that stock flow mindset War Buffet
[60:04] mindset I'm like Bitcoin is not a
[60:07] company Bitcoin is a protocol and that
[60:10] was really hard for me in the first like
[60:13] few months to understand and I had this
[60:16] technology background even I had this DC
[60:19] I knew what what the the layers are I
[60:21] learned it in school I had to learn it
[60:24] there and still it was really hard for
[60:25] me to understand and yeah it's it's it's
[60:28] it's really important to always like
[60:30] keep mentioning it that Bitcoin is a
[60:33] protocol and you should not diversify in
[60:38] ethereum totally but Robin that's a
[60:40] really important thing that you just
[60:41] said because there a techn because
[60:44] there's a whole bunch of technologists
[60:46] that people just turn off their brain
[60:48] and don't do the work because they think
[60:51] okay the technology person said that
[60:54] this new technology is better than
[60:56] Bitcoin when it's really it can't be
[60:59] right if you if you do the work here you
[61:02] understand this protocol is like none
[61:04] other and nothing else will survive and
[61:06] I don't say that lightly um I say so and
[61:09] you could look at my work on this and I
[61:12] wrote an article called finding signal
[61:14] in a noisy World um you could find it on
[61:17] Jeff
[61:23] booth.com me a plausible I've asked for
[61:26] it a plausible way that that isn't how
[61:30] this is working out now like you said
[61:32] it's so some people have to read it five
[61:35] six 10 20 times before it finally clicks
[61:39] but this is very very different than
[61:42] than than what the majority of the
[61:44] planet thinks it is it's very very true
[61:46] and unfortunately we are coming to the
[61:49] end of the podcast uh and uh I want to
[61:52] uh we have an end routine in the podcast
[61:54] because we had a previous guest asked a
[61:56] question for the next guest and my my
[61:59] last guest was Ella Huff you probably
[62:01] know her the the daughter of Love Ella
[62:04] she's fantastic and and and she asked
[62:08] the question what should young people uh
[62:11] be focused on for the next
[62:15] years um spending more time
[62:18] understanding this first and then once
[62:20] they understand it spending more time in
[62:22] that in this ecosystem so this ecosystem
[62:25] is going to see an incredible amount of
[62:28] growth and if you can insert yourself
[62:30] into that now it's an open monetary
[62:32] Network it's an open platform it's an
[62:34] open uh technology open protocol so what
[62:38] that means is you could do anything and
[62:41] move your time you could start a Meetup
[62:43] locally by starting a Meetup locally
[62:45] you'll meet other people in this and
[62:47] you'll start to see different
[62:48] opportunities you can I will tell you
[62:51] this for sure because I'm I'm seeing a
[62:54] bunch of these companies growing so fast
[62:56] in their Spa this space they're all
[62:59] looking for great talent and every one
[63:01] of the Bitcoin companies that is growing
[63:03] so fast and looking for talent would
[63:06] much prefer
[63:08] bitcoiners because most of the work has
[63:10] already done now you still need skill
[63:11] sets and whatever so now how do you make
[63:14] yourself valuable and how do you meet
[63:15] those people I'll give you a quick
[63:19] hint I used to hire people be so before
[63:22] I would place a job
[63:26] on on a job
[63:27] board there would be people trying to
[63:30] get trying to kind of very rarely
[63:32] happened but but the people that were
[63:34] trying to give me Value First and they
[63:37] loved what I was doing who do you think
[63:39] got jobs before you plac them on a job
[63:41] board right so so so in instead of
[63:44] trying to compete where fish where
[63:45] everybody else is fishing go go and
[63:49] provide value and go and think about
[63:51] providing value to other people in the
[63:53] world that you are want to create create
[63:55] and it'll just expand for you so you
[63:58] there's lots and lots of exp of
[64:00] companies here that are going to be they
[64:03] won't look exactly the same because
[64:05] because the Fiat system is very uh very
[64:08] different so it won't be a monopoly type
[64:09] of system they're going to constantly
[64:12] have to innovate but there a bunch of
[64:14] the different companies right now will
[64:16] look like in time the Googles and the
[64:19] microsofts of the of the Future these
[64:21] are being developed right right now and
[64:23] and that's going to expand so it's a an
[64:26] incredible time to move your energy into
[64:29] this and just to start like you Robin
[64:33] you started a podcast that's that's a
[64:35] way by starting a podcast we met right
[64:38] and you're meeting a whole bunch of
[64:39] different people that will expand other
[64:41] people will start meetup groups or meet
[64:43] different different entrepreneurs but as
[64:45] you start spending your time in this
[64:48] ecosystem it'll expand I even uh had uh
[64:52] Asen from the Rel app on a few episodes
[64:57] ago like it's uh not published now but
[64:59] uh it will be published when this
[65:01] episode will be published uh or it's out
[65:04] and he told the story how he got the job
[65:06] at relay uh on the podcast and he uh
[65:10] basically took that hint or that
[65:12] blueprint that you just gave uh to one
[65:15] onone because he uh spammed Julian and I
[65:20] think IMO uh both with post idea and and
[65:25] how they can improve the social media uh
[65:28] um presence and now he is the social
[65:30] media lead in the on the relay uh app so
[65:34] I think that like just a few episodes
[65:36] ago exactly what you said an and real
[65:40] world present and story where people can
[65:44] go through and and and and listen
[65:46] to that's like um uh
