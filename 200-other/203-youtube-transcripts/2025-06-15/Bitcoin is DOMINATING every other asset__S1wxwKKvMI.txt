[00:00] in the last 15 years nothing has come
[00:01] close to the performance of Bitcoin so
[00:03] looking into the future if I want to
[00:06] store value for the next 10 15 20 years
[00:09] uh nothing bits Bitcoin 70 countries or
[00:11] something like that use the US dollar as
[00:13] a primary currency and then some of the
[00:15] countries that have their own currency
[00:17] even use as a secondary currency the US
[00:19] dollar so this gives him them even a
[00:21] wider range of of possibilities to
[00:23] export the inflation and uh impose their
[00:27] their force on the world if you look at
[00:28] the business between and Russia all we
[00:31] are seeing is these guys moving away
[00:33] from the US dollar lot of people are
[00:34] finding an escape through
[00:37] Bitcoin what do you think is the role
[00:40] that Bitcoin plays in the financial
[00:42] markets like what what do you see what
[00:45] is bitcoin for you in the role of all
[00:47] the financial markets where do you see
[00:49] Bitcoin will find its
[00:51] place well uh personally I use Bitcoin
[00:55] as a store of value um being in the
[00:59] investing space there's quite a number
[01:01] of uh things or asset classes that you
[01:04] can use to store value over time so I
[01:07] cover a lot about Forex Trading I look
[01:10] at stocks indices and all that so while
[01:14] all of these assets tend to perform well
[01:17] especially if you're really good at what
[01:19] you do in investing uh over time in the
[01:22] last 15 years nothing has come close to
[01:24] the performance of Bitcoin so looking
[01:26] into the future if I want to store value
[01:29] for the next 10 15 20 years uh nothing
[01:33] beats Bitcoin so but uh technically I'll
[01:37] do a lot of stuff uh working really hard
[01:39] to create value in the space but once I
[01:42] have that surprise income I use Bitcoin
[01:44] to store that value over
[01:47] time amazing and uh maybe for people
[01:50] that don't know like what is Forex
[01:54] Trading so uh in Forex Trading uh all we
[01:58] do is uh speculate uh trying to
[02:00] speculate between the exchange rate of
[02:03] different currencies so mostly we cover
[02:06] the most liquid ones for instance the
[02:09] Euro tra is the dollar so after doing
[02:12] some analysis and you realize let's say
[02:14] the dollar is getting the Euro then you
[02:17] buy the Dollar sell the Euro and then
[02:20] you close position make a profit okay
[02:23] very interesting do do you foresee I
[02:24] mean this is like a deep topic but do
[02:26] you foresee a world where there's only
[02:29] Bitcoin like we we get and obviously if
[02:31] if there's ever coming this point this
[02:33] will be a point where it's like 100
[02:35] years in the future like it's not
[02:36] something that will come tomorrow uh but
[02:38] do you see a a world where um Bitcoin is
[02:42] the last like the the only currency and
[02:44] the only Reserve currency that we have
[02:46] and is kind of then eliminating Forex
[02:50] Trading well um predictions over the the
[02:54] long term about the future tend to be
[02:56] wrong a majority of the times so um what
[02:59] I for see is a period of time between
[03:03] now and let's say the next 10 years when
[03:06] a lot of people as well as companies
[03:09] this could expand as as far much as
[03:12] governments
[03:13] where say the single based assets that
[03:19] people use to store value transitions
[03:21] from other assets to bitcoin so for
[03:24] instance uh here in Kenya majority of
[03:27] people tend to store value in L or in it
[03:31] so by the time you finish uh campas and
[03:34] uh you looking for your first job once
[03:36] you get into gain F employment
[03:39] immediately you'll feel societal
[03:41] pressure to buy a piece of land to store
[03:43] some value for your future or for your
[03:46] retirement so over time we are seeing a
[03:49] lot of people open up to bitcoin
[03:51] starting to realize that it's a much
[03:53] better stock value over time so right
[03:56] now we are seeing that happening in
[03:58] Kenya I know guys in the US majorly use
[04:01] the stock market as a stock value
[04:03] because it TS to beat inflation or much
[04:06] inflation over time so what I see in the
[04:10] future is a most likely scenario where
[04:13] Bitcoin first becomes a reserve asset
[04:16] before now starting to eliminate the
[04:19] need of other currencies so it might not
[04:21] happen in my generation where Bitcoin
[04:23] becomes the one single asset being used
[04:26] as money but for now I believe the fat
[04:28] currencies might uh be holding for at
[04:31] least uh the Next
[04:35] Generation yeah also things like the the
[04:38] currency like governments will hold on
[04:41] to their currency as long as humanly
[04:44] possible they they will they want to
[04:46] have this this kind of impact in the
[04:48] market because this this gives him also
[04:50] like really great power um what do you
[04:53] see like when when when we are looking
[04:55] now at that future where Bitcoin is
[04:57] actually like a reserve currency or like
[04:59] it's it's at a really good adoption rate
[05:03] um do you think this can actually change
[05:06] something or maybe even speci especially
[05:08] for Africa or Kenya um when when we have
[05:12] countries that are relying on on on
[05:14] other count currencies when all of the
[05:17] sudden there Bitcoin has a massive
[05:19] chance for them could this lift up the
[05:22] uh other nations like Africa like also
[05:25] Salvador is now doing in real time like
[05:28] other nations especially when uh the US
[05:31] dollar and then America maybe is losing
[05:34] their Reserve currency status with like
[05:37] how many countries have the US dollar
[05:39] like 70 countries or something like that
[05:41] use the US dollar as a primary currency
[05:43] and then some of the countries that have
[05:45] their own currency even use as a
[05:47] secondary currency the US dollar so this
[05:49] gives him them even a wider range of of
[05:52] possibilities to yeah export the
[05:54] inflation and uh impose their their
[05:57] force on the world how do you see this
[05:59] play stay out when when Bitcoin is
[06:01] becoming strong and stronger and getting
[06:03] to a really significant uh significant
[06:07] amount of
[06:09] adoption well uh I would say it's uh
[06:12] diff uh it has different impacts uh for
[06:15] different countries uh for instance if
[06:18] you look at the business between China
[06:20] and Russia uh all we are seeing is this
[06:22] guys moving away from the US dollar
[06:24] especially following the confiscation of
[06:27] over $300 billion from Russia as a
[06:30] result of the invasion of Ukraine but
[06:33] then if you look at the countries in the
[06:36] global South especially in subs Southern
[06:39] Africa you realize that these economies
[06:42] are getting more mized rather than
[06:46] theorization so um kiss in point for the
[06:50] last what two and a half years we have
[06:52] seen the US go for the fastest fastest
[06:55] rate hikes ever from 0.1% to 5.5% so
[06:59] this created a massive uh dollar demand
[07:02] because if you just convert your local
[07:05] currency for instance converting sh to
[07:07] the dollar and holding or let's say to a
[07:10] US Treasury in that position you are
[07:13] about to make more money literary that
[07:16] any other asset car around so uh for
[07:19] instance last year the cash Shilling uh
[07:22] lost about 24% to the dollar so anyone
[07:25] who just simply converted their cashing
[07:27] to the dollar they were up to 2 4% and
[07:30] if they just used those dollars to
[07:33] invest into a dollar backed asset could
[07:36] be SP 500 could be us treasuries they
[07:39] probably made more than anyone else or
[07:42] any other asset class locally so bonds
[07:45] underperformed people investing M Market
[07:47] funds or underperformed so this uh Trend
[07:51] where interest rates are really high and
[07:53] USG is are giving some good returns is
[07:56] creating demand for the dollar sub sou
[07:58] Africa so this trend of theorization
[08:02] might be working well for uh bigger
[08:05] economies like China Russia but it's not
[08:09] working very well for Subs economies uh
[08:13] mainly because our our economies are
[08:16] basically net importers so we have a
[08:19] very high demand for the dollar and at
[08:21] the same time we are heavily dependent
[08:23] on our loans from these uh Global
[08:26] institutions like the World Bank the IMF
[08:28] and so on so it's uh very tricky for us
[08:32] we find ourselves more reliant on the
[08:35] dollar compared to these other economies
[08:38] so while we are seeing a scenario where
[08:41] at some point the us is going to be
[08:43] forced to continue expanding Supply and
[08:46] uh the dollar continues weakening then
[08:48] this is where Bitcoin comes in so the
[08:51] base use case for Africa is uh also a
[08:55] little bit different uh Africa is a
[08:58] compartment
[09:00] I would say compound um divided uh we
[09:03] have like different jurisdictions across
[09:06] 54 Nations and it's very hard to
[09:08] transfer money from one country to
[09:10] another but the costs are very high so
[09:13] as our currencies continue depreciating
[09:16] against the dollar you find that more
[09:18] and more RWS are being implemented to
[09:21] stop people from moving away from the
[09:23] local currency so for instance uh you
[09:26] will see limitations as to how much
[09:28] dollars you can hold in your account or
[09:30] how much you can withdraw in your
[09:32] commercial bank account so you find that
[09:35] lot of people are finding an escape
[09:37] through Bitcoin so if you're a business
[09:40] that serves a crossb transactions let's
[09:42] say you're serving East Africa Kenya
[09:44] Uganda Tanzania you realize that Bitcoin
[09:49] is becoming a more effective way to do
[09:51] cross order transactions so it's coming
[09:53] in as an easy solution for you to be
[09:56] able to send money beer top in a trans
[09:59] Act without these
[10:02] limitations it's it's fascinating to see
[10:05] um especially when you look at the the
[10:07] loans that you get from the IMF and the
[10:10] other like institutions um this is like
[10:13] an highly dependent state of from the
[10:17] United States that countries have like
[10:20] Africa um and so you are saying that's
[10:23] like it's kind of dangerous to get too
[10:25] fast away from that because you're
[10:27] dependent on those those loans what is
[10:29] say
[10:31] rad well I'm not saying it's dangerous
[10:34] I'm I'm just saying that um it's more of
[10:36] a capture that a majority of these
[10:39] economies cannot Hest try to run away
[10:43] from the dollar because they still need
[10:45] the dollar to do other transactions uh
[10:47] for instance um for the I would say for
[10:50] the last couple of decades majority of
[10:52] African nations could not do
[10:54] transactions without the dollar so even
[10:57] if we are transacting with a country
[10:59] next on we would have to convert let's
[11:01] say Shing to dollar and then let's say
[11:03] dollar to Tanzanian Shillings so the
[11:06] dollar has been the core or the backbone
[11:08] of our financial system so for R um for
[11:13] instance if you want to import cars from
[11:15] Japan uh there was no in between where
[11:18] we could let's say trade directory with
[11:21] japanes in so we still have to find
[11:23] dollars in the market and then use those
[11:25] dollars to buy the Japanese import cars
[11:29] so that has been the backbone for
[11:31] majority of African countries and uh as
[11:34] long as this Remains the system it's
[11:37] very hard for African countries to to
[11:40] deize
[11:42] yeah yeah
[11:44] yeah there's a reason why it's it's so
[11:47] strong in that and you described it
[11:48] quite well how how deeply in rooted uh
[11:52] the system the fear system is in all all
[11:54] the countries and how hard it is to to
[11:57] get get rid of it what's your current
[11:58] like what thoughts actually on on the on
[12:01] the global Game Theory playing out a
[12:03] little bit like we have El Salvador that
[12:05] has Bitcoin adopted I don't know about
[12:08] if you know about Surinam like a really
[12:10] small small Latin count like 600,000
[12:13] people only uh where the president or
[12:16] the future president with Maya is really
[12:19] passionate about Bitcoin and she has
[12:21] high chances of winning we have
[12:23] Argentina where the president is saying
[12:26] uh let's bust all the central banks
[12:28] which is really interesting and he's
[12:30] like an Austrian economic kind of a guy
[12:34] um how do you see this this this playing
[12:37] out in the in the short run do do you
[12:39] foresee more Bitcoin countries coming in
[12:41] what what's your thoughts on Argentina
[12:43] El Salvador uh is is that also something
[12:46] that Africa might start because
[12:49] especially I think Nigeria is is the the
[12:52] country with the highest adoption rate
[12:54] from The Crossroads Adoption rate what I
[12:56] heard there a lot of uh use in Africa
[13:00] for for
[13:01] that well uh I've been following closely
[13:05] the story of uh El salvad and I think
[13:09] it's a really big story for the world
[13:12] about Bitcoin um from what we are seeing
[13:16] is that more and more countries are
[13:18] looking the Bitcoin way compared to I
[13:20] would say five years ago where out of
[13:23] countries were either in different or
[13:26] hostile against Bitcoin adoption so
[13:29] what we are seeing is more and more
[13:31] countries being open-minded especially
[13:34] after what happened with us sport
[13:36] Bitcoin ETFs so us being a global leader
[13:39] in terms of a regulatory framework now
[13:43] we are seeing other uh Regulators across
[13:46] different nations being taking a softer
[13:49] stance in terms of Bitcoin regulation or
[13:52] cryptocurrency regulation so uh I
[13:54] believe that's the first step where they
[13:57] take uh softer STS but then the next
[14:00] step is about adopting Bitcoin uh or
[14:03] allowing citizens or Sovereign funds to
[14:06] have an exposure to bitcoin
[14:09] so going forward I I'm expecting that
[14:12] there will be some countries that will
[14:14] take the front Ro of buying when more
[14:18] Bitcoin but as we know uh this this
[14:21] limitation of 21 million and uh at this
[14:24] point I don't think there's enough for
[14:26] every country to adopt and buy m Rey the
[14:29] same way uh we have seen micro buying
[14:32] Bitcoin so at some point to be this is a
[14:37] the available Supply right now it's I
[14:39] believe around 2 million Bitcoins uh
[14:42] around uh the global exchanges so the
[14:47] moment more and more countries and
[14:50] corporations go for this remaining
[14:52] Supply you you realize that there will
[14:54] be a pace to get the last Bitcoin so at
[14:57] some point you will see when countries
[14:59] printing money just to get a portion of
[15:02] that Bitcoin so that uh they hold uh a
[15:05] position in that uh I tend to think of
[15:09] it as digital property so if this
[15:12] digital property is limited to 21
[15:14] million at least everyone needs a share
[15:16] so it's a matter of when rather than a
[15:20] matter of if yeah it's it's very true
[15:23] and I'm curious how you like came to all
[15:25] those conclusions let's dive a little
[15:27] bit into uh what you did uh to to came
[15:30] here you're also like a rider at Forbes
[15:33] and you have a lot of videos also on
[15:35] YouTube that I saw uh and you're active
[15:38] also on Twitter um after school you you
[15:41] probably went at high school and you
[15:42] said like I think you went into trading
[15:45] already then uh how how was your path to
[15:49] before you discovered
[15:51] Bitcoin well um I'm a student of
[15:55] acturial science I studied at a local
[15:59] Technical University called Technical
[16:00] University of Kenya um after that I
[16:05] dived right into trading so I've been
[16:08] trading for over a decade now uh Maj
[16:11] Forex Trading uh then around 2015 2016
[16:15] this is when I had my first interaction
[16:18] with Bitcoin uh bought my first Bitcoin
[16:21] at about
[16:22] $1,000 but uh having this Trader mindset
[16:26] I was not invested in realizing the
[16:28] philosophy of Bitcoin what it is or how
[16:30] it works so I was in there for the trade
[16:34] so the moment I got 3x I just sold my
[16:36] Bitcoin and I had a very successful
[16:39] trade so fast forward after that I went
[16:43] into other
[16:44] cryptocurrencies uh traded quite a good
[16:46] number of them uh like uh ethereum all
[16:50] those shitcoins I went through the
[16:52] entire rabbit Hall then at some point I
[16:55] lost everything uh first forward this
[16:58] was an
[16:59] Australian exit called
[17:02] cryptopia uh at one point uh it crossed
[17:05] down and I lost all my coins and uh I
[17:08] had to start from zero again uh started
[17:11] researching understanding uh what really
[17:14] holds value what doesn't hold value um
[17:17] then I transition to this uh position
[17:20] where I was looking at Bitcoin and
[17:21] perhaps the top 10 coins in the crypto
[17:23] market so I would be looking at ethereum
[17:26] bance and stuff then after researching
[17:29] further I realized that these are CS
[17:32] kind of shift every cycle so if you look
[17:35] at the different Cycles in Bitcoin uh
[17:38] you look at the top 10 uh
[17:40] cryptocurrencies in the first cycle top
[17:42] 10 in the second cycle top 10 in the
[17:43] third cycle uh they kind of shift every
[17:47] time so it's um it's like playing that
[17:51] game of H Mall um this time uh you got
[17:55] the best Pig next time you get the last
[17:58] pig at all so the one crypto asset that
[18:01] actually stood F over all the CES was
[18:04] Bitcoin always number one so that's when
[18:07] I took a deep dive uh tried researching
[18:10] understanding what it is how it works
[18:12] and then eventually I dropped all those
[18:16] uh alternative assets and focused on
[18:18] bitcoin
[18:21] 100% yeah amazing and and uh you also
[18:24] said that uh you traded in the beginning
[18:27] uh which uh
[18:29] like I always try to like just hold on
[18:32] um which brings me to a question like is
[18:35] does it actually matter when you buy
[18:37] Bitcoin is there any model that you uh
[18:39] look at uh like there are so many
[18:41] different like there there's uh the P
[18:44] account BL B model then there's this
[18:46] from gvani the the net the power law
[18:50] model there like so many different kind
[18:52] of a things that try to time Bitcoin and
[18:55] try to like when should you get in
[18:57] there's also like a weighted DCA thing
[19:00] where you always buy in Bitcoin but that
[19:02] sometimes you buy in more and sometimes
[19:04] Buy in a little bit less like do do you
[19:07] have anything like that or is like is
[19:09] there any does the timing matter when
[19:11] you're buy
[19:13] Bitcoin uh honestly no any time I have
[19:16] some surise amount of money I just buy
[19:19] Bitcoin so um I I tried timing it uh
[19:23] some time back uh found myself buying
[19:26] the top of the previous cycle 69k
[19:30] so I collected a lot of funds especially
[19:32] from my trading activities that just put
[19:34] it all in Bitcoin at 69k then all the
[19:38] big bare market so since that time I've
[19:41] been uh simply buying any time I have a
[19:43] chance so if I get a chance to buy uh
[19:47] let's say $20 with the Bitcoin this week
[19:49] there it doesn't matter what the price
[19:53] is was this the the the biggest things
[19:56] that that that Chang in your view of of
[19:58] Bitcoin you first like encounted and you
[20:00] traded it then you went into shitcoins
[20:03] as you said uh and and now you're here
[20:06] like I I feel like when when someone is
[20:08] adopting Bitcoin they always like make a
[20:10] lot of changes how they view Bitcoin and
[20:13] how they even view the the financial
[20:15] markets H at least for me like my whole
[20:18] world kind of shifted how I think about
[20:21] what money is what the financial markets
[20:24] are and how this all interacts with each
[20:26] other and actually what Bitcoin also is
[20:28] like has changed a lot in the last four
[20:30] years that I'm in Bitcoin um how how did
[20:33] this change for you like you said it's
[20:35] it's only like you traded it uh you
[20:38] probably saw it as like more asset then
[20:41] how do you see it now and then how did
[20:43] also maybe the the question what is
[20:45] money for you uh change while you were
[20:48] adopting uh
[20:51] Bitcoin well um I don't know how to
[20:54] explain it uh first of all uh I was deep
[20:58] in into D5 platforms so I had a view
[21:03] where you know you can uh do on one side
[21:07] uh the job you do to create value
[21:08] personally it's a trading I also work as
[21:11] a financial markets analyst with a local
[21:13] Forex broker so once I get that value I
[21:16] need to store it for a future date I
[21:18] need to pit inflation make sure that
[21:20] that value stays in that so I saw uh
[21:24] different opportunities one of them was
[21:26] to literally just park my money in a
[21:29] defi platform uh where I would get
[21:32] different apis or annual returns and
[21:35] then after working my money um for a
[21:38] couple of months in a def platform I
[21:41] started realizing that the to tokenomics
[21:44] are not making sense so uh we have this
[21:47] platform on top of our lay to chain uh
[21:50] then it's promising 50% plus uh returns
[21:54] at the end of the year so when you put
[21:56] your money in there and you lock it you
[21:58] expect that at the end of the year
[21:59] you're going to have 50% uh more coins
[22:03] of course if it's a good market and the
[22:05] coins keep getting value then you have
[22:07] some pretty good outl then uh diving uh
[22:11] diving deeper into the chain you realize
[22:14] that these tokens are not uh coming just
[22:17] out of anywhere uh the platform is
[22:20] designed to print more tokens that
[22:23] basically adds to the inflation in the
[22:25] ecosystem and you realize that you're
[22:27] getting paid by your own inflation so
[22:30] that was a deep uh deep lesson for me uh
[22:34] deep Awakening moment uh mainly because
[22:37] it's the same thing happening in the
[22:39] Fiat system around us so if you happen
[22:41] to visit Kenya uh or understand what's
[22:44] currently happen in Kenya uh we are
[22:46] living into what I would describe into a
[22:49] yield F so uh there are these financial
[22:53] institutions that we call SOS um
[22:56] Sac realize that lot of Kenyans are
[22:59] parking their money in these circles and
[23:01] then at the end of the year they get an
[23:04] annual yield of about 10 to 12% so there
[23:07] are also other people are buing money in
[23:10] a what call Money Market funds uh
[23:12] they're getting uh 10 plus uh returns
[23:15] maybe 13% at the end of the year uh then
[23:18] we have the treasury bonds which have
[23:20] also gone retail meaning that the
[23:22] average Kenyan can invest directly with
[23:24] the Central Bank buy a bond and then get
[23:27] 16 177% the end of the year so like
[23:30] literally everyone who is just saving
[23:32] money they getting 10% plus within the
[23:36] country at the end of the year but the
[23:38] real question is where is this yield
[23:40] coming from so the yield is basically uh
[23:44] increased money supply which is
[23:46] basically means we are all getting paid
[23:48] by our own inflation so yes everyone
[23:51] gets 10% but then the price of
[23:52] everything goes up by 10% plus so on B
[23:55] we have more money but in terms of real
[23:57] purchasing power it's going down so that
[24:00] took me into a really good deep dive
[24:04] into what's happening the F world what's
[24:06] happening with other cryptocurrencies
[24:08] and the fact that Bitcoin has this limit
[24:11] and for anyone to get Bitcoin you have
[24:13] to put in some kind of work whether you
[24:14] are mining or buying that Bitcoin isn't
[24:17] fear from someone else then I saw the
[24:19] real value proposition from Bitcoin and
[24:22] I tend to believe that this will hold
[24:24] value over
[24:26] time absolutely and and you also I
[24:30] threed on on Twitter about that topic
[24:33] and you kind of like called FDX before
[24:36] as you as you told me uh this go got is
[24:40] in the same direction right as like FTX
[24:43] Celsius blockfi all those the things you
[24:45] you came to know about it before right
[24:48] yes um I remember that time I had just
[24:51] started wrting uh for fobs um this time
[24:57] I was ring at uh
[24:59] the policies that are being implemented
[25:01] by different exchanges and somehow it
[25:03] didn't make sense uh on one side uh an
[25:07] average Bitcoin transactions will take a
[25:09] couple of minutes uh before you get the
[25:11] confirmations and the transaction is
[25:13] complete but if you're operating within
[25:15] an ex let's say you deposit money in
[25:19] binance FDX or whatever platform that is
[25:22] if you are moving Bitcoin from one
[25:24] account to another it's instant so
[25:27] that's the moment I real that these
[25:28] transactions are not happening uh on the
[25:32] Chain uh they only happening on an Excel
[25:35] sheet uh basically meaning that if I
[25:37] transer some Bitcoin from uh my account
[25:40] to your account on an exchange platform
[25:43] they don't actually transfer that money
[25:45] physically it's just numbers changing on
[25:47] a spreadsheet so then I realized that uh
[25:51] the only time that these guys are
[25:53] actually transacting on the chain is
[25:55] when you're making a deposit meaning
[25:57] that you're moving a Bitcoin from your
[25:59] wallet to their wallet and then when
[26:01] you're making a withdrawal that's when
[26:04] you're moving Bitcoin from their wallet
[26:05] to your wallet but then if you're making
[26:08] uh these transactions on their platform
[26:10] they'll just be shifting numbers of the
[26:12] chain and of course it makes sense you
[26:14] don't want to save on those transaction
[26:16] costs but then uh I also saw that there
[26:19] was this attempt for a lot of people uh
[26:25] attempt to make a lot of people retain
[26:27] their money within the EOS system so
[26:29] they didn't want people withdrawing so
[26:31] they were just promoting depositing
[26:33] trading but never withdrawing so for
[26:35] majority of the exchanges that time uh
[26:38] it was more about bringing in more cash
[26:40] but nothing goes out so the uh
[26:43] depositing was free but withdrawals were
[26:45] being charged that time so then uh
[26:49] looking at the entire bare Market that
[26:52] and at that time uh that's when the bare
[26:55] Market was just St I realized that price
[26:57] was going down but the number of new
[27:00] wets was just increasing our number of
[27:02] new buyers was just increasing so
[27:05] somehow it didn't make sense to me but
[27:07] then I realized that these guys are
[27:09] hypothecating the Bitcoin so every time
[27:12] uh you guys uh myself and other people
[27:15] in the system uh deposit money in the
[27:17] system um every time we trade or buy
[27:21] even more Bitcoin as long as it remains
[27:23] within the exchange then the exchange is
[27:26] able to use that bit going to land to
[27:29] other people or whatever that means So
[27:32] eventually it came to light when uh we
[27:34] realized that FTX was basically using
[27:36] clients funds trade on Ara so it was uh
[27:40] just a few weeks after I had done my
[27:42] post then uh we saw the entire txd colls
[27:46] if you are listening to this podcast you
[27:48] might be wondering what is actually the
[27:50] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[27:53] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[27:55] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[27:57] right source and you have to store
[27:59] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[28:01] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[28:03] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[28:06] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[28:08] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[28:10] own token or something like that be on a
[28:12] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[28:15] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[28:18] for that and now where do you store
[28:21] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[28:23] hardware wallet on a self custody
[28:26] solution where you yourself hold your
[28:28] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[28:32] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[28:34] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[28:37] there back up your seat fras and you are
[28:39] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[28:43] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[28:46] it's an absolutely must have one last
[28:49] thing before we get back to the video
[28:50] I'm really passionate about meeting
[28:52] other bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[28:55] opportunity in middle of Europe in Jun
[28:58] the Bitcoin Brock conference it's the
[29:00] best and biggest Bitcoin only conference
[29:04] in whole of Europe for all Americans
[29:06] please visit Europe and visit this place
[29:08] in June for all europees it's a must go
[29:11] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[29:14] PR conference you basically have to come
[29:16] I will do interviews there and I would
[29:18] love to meet you all there use code
[29:21] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[29:23] discounts and use the links down in the
[29:26] description there were a lot of uh um
[29:30] even uh popular voices I think like Cory
[29:33] clipston also was one of them that
[29:35] actually said before like this this
[29:36] thing is not sustainable you you like
[29:39] the just look at the numbers as you also
[29:41] described now like when you look at
[29:43] everything that's there for looking at
[29:45] it it's like no secrets uh they they
[29:48] cannot make money from that so like uh
[29:51] this brings me back to just like the
[29:53] importance of self- custody like you
[29:55] have to take your own uh Keys as
[29:58] especially if you have any significant
[30:00] of money uh in the exchange um uh one
[30:04] topic that might be interesting um how
[30:08] do you look at utxo like I don't know
[30:10] utxo management because when you have
[30:13] like in transfer Bitcoin from The
[30:15] Exchange to like in hardare wallet of
[30:17] custody wallet uh of course if it's a
[30:19] really small amount they can be stuck
[30:22] there they can be like just like hidden
[30:24] there uh and and I feel like especially
[30:27] in where the the people are struggling a
[30:29] little bit more uh or like the the
[30:32] income level is not as high it could
[30:35] really fast push them out of the base
[30:37] layer and do you see this already
[30:39] happening where a lot of people in
[30:41] Africa just use the lightning layer or
[30:43] like the the second layer because they
[30:46] fear that the utxos are too small for in
[30:49] order to maybe spend it in in in in the
[30:52] future and maybe just like uh quickly to
[30:55] for everybody in the in in the uh
[30:58] audience that does not understand what
[30:59] utxo management is um utxo is basically
[31:03] when you spend Bitcoin you always have a
[31:05] utxo and if the utxo is too small you
[31:08] might be in the in in the position where
[31:12] in the future when the fees are getting
[31:13] higher and higher that you cannot spend
[31:16] your Bitcoin without paying more in the
[31:18] fees than the actual Bitcoin are worth
[31:20] so um especially in a country uh like
[31:24] Africa this is even more important than
[31:28] uh than around the world
[31:31] right yes um I think uh for immediate
[31:35] needs uh one needs to Simply convert
[31:39] their Bitcoin on chain to lightning uh
[31:42] it tends to be more useful especially if
[31:45] you're doing more frequent transactions
[31:48] so whenever I'm dealing with a uh let's
[31:51] say a beginner in Bitcoin I nor try to
[31:55] advise uh them to take two approaches so
[31:58] on one side I look at the longterm view
[32:01] of Bitcoin so this is where you self
[32:04] custom a big amount of Bitcoin that you
[32:07] think might be useful over the next 5 10
[32:10] years and so on and then to at least
[32:12] have a checking account for more
[32:14] frequent expenditure so uh the way I
[32:17] visualize this is that uh for a checking
[32:20] account it's easier to use liting than
[32:22] on chain because the fees would be much
[32:23] more but then if it's a Bitcoin you want
[32:26] to hold for 5
[32:28] then it's much better to use onch so
[32:31] it's easier to accumulate this amount on
[32:34] an exchange so if let's say you are Don
[32:37] cost averaging let's say $100 a month
[32:39] $200 a month uh it's much easier to put
[32:42] that in an exchange uh you put that uh
[32:46] every month and let's say if you get
[32:48] something around $1,000 plus I don't
[32:50] think the fees will be that big so in
[32:53] that case you can consolidate that with
[32:55] one direct withdrawal to your C wallet
[32:57] and then store that for a long time so
[33:00] rather than buying let's say 20 uh $20
[33:03] $30 worth of bitcoin transferring that
[33:05] to your wallet and then adding the utxos
[33:07] together which would not make sense at a
[33:10] future date so it it's much more easier
[33:13] to either build uh on an exchange or if
[33:17] you have a lot of transactions that you
[33:19] have accumulated in one wallet then you
[33:21] might want to make one's big transaction
[33:24] into a different wet
[33:28] yeah that's uh that's that is really
[33:31] good and for people listening if this
[33:33] topic is completely new to you I think I
[33:35] have like 10 episodes back or something
[33:37] like that a deep uh deep episode with
[33:41] over one hour where we Dove deep really
[33:43] into UT takes own management what you
[33:45] can do what you can consolidate what are
[33:47] your best practice and stuff like that
[33:50] um Africa I feel like always when I hear
[33:54] uh people speaking from Africa they
[33:56] always told me about the scams that were
[34:00] around Bitcoin uh in the previous years
[34:02] that uh were a lot of scams going on
[34:06] with Bitcoin uh and people are still a
[34:09] little bit U shocked because like not
[34:11] shocked but maybe still a little bit
[34:13] afraid of Bitcoin because of those those
[34:16] scams where you also like encountering
[34:18] those scams personally where you also
[34:20] like um heard some stories about that or
[34:23] even like someone tried to to get you
[34:26] into this those scams I just like I'm
[34:29] curious about them because I hear so
[34:30] much about the scams in Africa in
[34:34] Austria also had scams in 2017 a little
[34:36] bit like multi-level marketing schemes I
[34:39] I was uh once asked to get in on one of
[34:43] those that's why I came so late into
[34:45] Bitcoin but is this also like did you
[34:47] also encounter
[34:49] those uh well uh personally uh I'm
[34:53] usually very deep into research uh doing
[34:56] a background study studies who lik have
[34:59] not been scammed before uh also a
[35:02] majority of African countries tend to
[35:05] have uh very weak regulatory Frameworks
[35:09] so it's much easier to get away with a
[35:12] scam or scamming before Kenya compared
[35:14] to being in the US or the in the country
[35:17] in the Euro zone so that has been the
[35:20] breeding or the the reason why there's a
[35:23] a of scums operating around so uh second
[35:27] uh education is not like really good in
[35:30] terms of a financial literacy uh so we
[35:34] find that a lot of people get scammed
[35:36] on so as we speak right now the events
[35:39] SCS running on radio gazettes uh some of
[35:42] them even on TV especially gambling
[35:44] sector uh some of them even with
[35:46] licenses and uh it has become so
[35:49] normalized that this just two minutes
[35:51] comes around so um we have experienced
[35:55] this as a big challenge especially in
[35:57] the Forex industry and the way we have
[35:59] been encountering this is by doing more
[36:01] and more financial R sessions so our
[36:05] personally working with FPA local
[36:08] financial markets broker uh we will do
[36:11] Financial Ry events free of charge in
[36:13] different parts of the country where we
[36:15] talk to the people try to help them
[36:18] understand what reg uh what a regulated
[36:20] broker is what uh a majority of SCS look
[36:23] like uh or to avoid uh or not to go for
[36:27] and that has worked very well in uh
[36:30] establishing this framework of knowledge
[36:34] uh and thought leadership where you able
[36:36] to to identify that this is the leaders
[36:41] the system uh these are the people who
[36:44] can be trusted and that has gone really
[36:46] well into eliminating the notion that uh
[36:49] previously people think Forex has come
[36:52] and now people know that there is a a
[36:53] regulated environment and it's a
[36:55] legitimate industry so on the Bitcoin
[36:58] side I've seen it happening uh a person
[37:01] uh gets approached by a scammer and then
[37:03] they come to me and they like highers uh
[37:07] do you think these guys can be trusted
[37:08] do you think it's a legit platform and
[37:10] then I advise them based on what the
[37:13] project is so I've seen it happen over
[37:16] and over again and I believe these
[37:18] Financial sessions we do whether on
[37:21] YouTube physical sessions on eggs I
[37:24] think they are very helpful in the
[37:25] industry because they help people I mean
[37:27] what is valuable what is legitimated
[37:30] what is uh
[37:33] not yeah and it's it's it's fascinating
[37:36] for me that like we have to do so much
[37:38] more education work that's that's for me
[37:41] always the the takeaway from that uh
[37:44] because if people are educated about all
[37:46] the sces going around how Bitcoin is
[37:49] verifiable what what is a real exchange
[37:51] was there a fake exchange and stuff like
[37:54] that then we don't have a real problem
[37:57] uh so we we just have to push education
[37:59] it's like kind of the purpose of the
[38:00] podcast to just push education worldwide
[38:02] that's why I also do it in English uh
[38:04] yeah really really cool I saw coming
[38:06] closer to the end of the podcast I saw
[38:08] one tweet of yours which is Absolut
[38:10] absolutely not related to bitcoin uh
[38:13] where you talked about why you should
[38:15] stop using multiple monitors do you
[38:18] remember that one I think I don't know
[38:20] when it was I just like saw it randomly
[38:23] in in my feet it's like as someone who
[38:26] has all is free screens why should I
[38:29] stop using my multiple
[38:32] monitors well um in my experience um
[38:36] I've worked with uh two Forex Brokers
[38:38] now and the very first week that you
[38:41] join the company uh you get allocated an
[38:44] IT guide they will get you set up they
[38:46] get you a laptop number of monitors and
[38:49] stuff so um I usually reject that and um
[38:54] this is mainly because I know and I
[38:56] understand that the human mind can only
[38:58] focus on one thing at a time so in order
[39:01] for you to achieve like maximum Focus
[39:04] especially on your work desk you need to
[39:06] reduce the number of decisions that you
[39:08] have to make uh to a minimum so if you
[39:10] need to like focus on reading a book you
[39:12] have to switch out notifications every
[39:14] time there's an extra decision it
[39:16] basically reduces your focus so if you
[39:19] have three different screens and you
[39:20] have to make decisions move from this
[39:22] screen to that screen to that screen uh
[39:25] basically reduces your focus then uses
[39:27] your productivity yeah definitely it's
[39:29] it's um I mean I always have fre screens
[39:32] I try to like keep things open but yeah
[39:35] you might right because when you focus
[39:37] on just one thing it's it's it's way
[39:40] nicer the only thing when I edit videos
[39:43] I do graphic designs it's sometimes nice
[39:45] to have like uh resources on on the
[39:48] right side where you can quickly get
[39:50] them in and like work on the main thing
[39:52] and I mean the laptop is like my third
[39:54] screen so I don't really count that uh I
[39:57] sometimes even have the the brightness
[39:59] turned off so so I don't see it because
[40:03] it's such a small screen compared to the
[40:05] other ones but yeah it's it's a it's an
[40:07] interesting topic because I'm really big
[40:09] on be being focused on one thing that's
[40:11] why I'm only Bitcoin that's why I'm only
[40:13] working on this podcast where that's why
[40:15] I'm doing only one thing at a time uh
[40:18] but I never thought about my my monitors
[40:19] I like I just wanted to quickly
[40:22] highlight
[40:22] that yeah if you think about it uh every
[40:27] every extra tab on an extra monitor is a
[40:31] movement away from the screen right in
[40:34] front of you so you just have more like
[40:37] rotations where every screen you have is
[40:39] an extra tab you can just add that as a
[40:41] tab on one screen definitely it's it's
[40:44] yeah I have to think about that
[40:45] definitely let see and before we get to
[40:48] the end routin of the podcast I'm always
[40:50] really curious about the guest uh and
[40:52] and especially because Bitcoin is are
[40:54] really really interesting um what are
[40:56] your Cur Cur ly extremely passionate
[40:59] about which we did not cover in the
[41:02] podcast till now like what is there
[41:04] anything besides Bitcoin besides the
[41:06] financial markets that you you are
[41:08] extremely passionate about that you want
[41:10] to
[41:11] share well I'm very passionate about
[41:14] Chess uh I started a local CL in a small
[41:18] town called limuru in Kenya uh we played
[41:22] two seasons in the Kenya Premier League
[41:24] uh before we were kicked out as during
[41:27] covid uh it was very difficult to get to
[41:30] attend all the games and stuff so I'm
[41:33] looking to rebuild that and uh at the
[41:36] same time uh though this is in very
[41:38] early stages I'm looking to uh build a
[41:41] Bitcoin harit G where we'll have out of
[41:44] bitcoiners coming together share ideas
[41:47] course it you'll have a whiskey Club a
[41:49] restaurant and uh all the necessary
[41:52] facilities that make the place better
[41:55] for bitcoiners
[41:59] H really cool yeah I also love chess uh
[42:02] we next next time we have a podcast we
[42:04] should play chess next
[42:06] to what's your what's your
[42:09] ELO um do you know your
[42:11] ELO
[42:16] I oh then then we cannot play you are
[42:18] way too good
[42:22] no which is kind of shallow compared to
[42:25] just uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I also
[42:29] play just uh I I Ed I use chess actually
[42:33] just to like uh have a have a break uh
