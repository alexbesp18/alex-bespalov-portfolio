[00:00] only real question is when do we reach
[00:02] that 1 million this massive
[00:04] institutional adoption that's going to
[00:07] take place we're really only at the
[00:08] beginning of it once we hit that 100,000
[00:11] I think it's a very important
[00:12] psychological level from there we could
[00:14] easily see it doubling tripling
[00:17] quadrupling in value certainly in terms
[00:19] of money there's a winner takes all
[00:21] scenario when people realize that real
[00:23] estate is not the best store of value
[00:25] but that Bitcoin is the best store of
[00:27] value and the hardest asset that will
[00:29] ever exist the current financialization
[00:31] of real estate will end those trillions
[00:34] of dollars of wealth will flow into
[00:36] Bitcoin the same thing with the stock
[00:38] market how do we get to this 1 million
[00:42] US dollar
[00:44] Mark yes so I think um most people
[00:48] nowadays uh who actually know anything
[00:51] about Bitcoin um are agreed that Bitcoin
[00:54] will eventually reach uh the $1 million
[00:58] Target um I think yeah other than maybe
[01:01] the Peter shifts of this world and those
[01:03] types um so the only real question is
[01:06] when do we reach um that 1 million I
[01:10] think the how um obviously there is you
[01:14] know massive amounts of capital that
[01:16] need to flow into Bitcoin um and how
[01:20] fast we get there really depends on how
[01:23] that Capital gets into Bitcoin um so the
[01:25] three main factors that I've sort of
[01:27] looked at um are the harving the ETFs
[01:30] and institutional adoption and this sort
[01:33] of infinite feedback loop um that's been
[01:37] mentioned by a few different um thinkers
[01:39] including safine amus um and the new
[01:43] sort of Plan G um Giovani um so I think
[01:50] the first factor for me clearly is the
[01:53] Haring U which there's been some
[01:56] controversy over recently as to whether
[01:58] it has any real effect on the price at
[02:01] all um Fred Krueger notably on Twitter
[02:05] was um criticizing this I think Giovani
[02:08] Plan G he was criticizing this as well
[02:11] um but for me uh really I see it as the
[02:15] sort of um the starting point uh for
[02:20] each of these fouryear cycles that we've
[02:22] had so far and that's to do really with
[02:25] um a supply shock so uh as we know of
[02:29] course every four years there's a
[02:32] harving event where the new Supply uh
[02:34] for the block reward is hared um and
[02:38] this really brings down the uh overall
[02:42] inflation rate of Bitcoin uh this cycle
[02:45] it'll of course go below um the
[02:48] inflation rate of gold which as we know
[02:50] for thousands of years has been the sort
[02:52] of uh the main uh hard money
[02:57] asset um and gold also has um a very
[03:02] high stock to flow ratio uh which is I
[03:05] believe it's 70 which means it's like 70
[03:07] year it'll take 70 years to um uh
[03:10] replace the current supply of gold um
[03:14] but one thing that's quite different
[03:16] about Bitcoin is that um it doesn't you
[03:21] know Gold's stock to flow ratio maybe be
[03:24] high but it's also very stable uh
[03:26] because the new supply of gold is um
[03:31] uh basically there's a steady uh flow
[03:35] and there's no sort of Supply shocks
[03:37] that come along the way whereas with
[03:39] Bitcoin every four years there's a
[03:41] sudden uh Supply shock that's caused by
[03:45] the Haring event so this means that uh
[03:48] bitcoin's stock to flow ratio uh is not
[03:51] only just going up but it's also going
[03:54] it eventually to Infinity which is
[03:56] something that safe forine points out in
[03:58] the Bitcoin standard
[04:01] so this fact that bitcoin's on this
[04:03] trajectory to infinite uh stock to flow
[04:07] um means that it's also the scarcest
[04:11] asset uh that will ever exist uh and the
[04:14] hardest monetary asset that will ever
[04:17] exist and these constant Supply
[04:20] shocks uh with at the same time
[04:23] increased demand because this is the
[04:25] other thing that um uh maybe plan um
[04:29] Plan B modelers being criticized for is
[04:31] the fact that it doesn't take into
[04:33] account demand or they say it doesn't
[04:35] take into account
[04:37] demand um but because Bitcoin is
[04:40] essentially a VIN good which is a good
[04:43] that the higher it goes in price the
[04:45] more people want it um demand increases
[04:50] as the as the price goes up and then we
[04:53] get these Supply shocks along the way
[04:55] which then further uh in increase the
[04:58] demand it's like a a cycle as we'll get
[05:00] into later um so yeah that's that's the
[05:03] first main
[05:04] factor um the second factor of course is
[05:07] the institutional adoption um which is a
[05:12] new Factor uh something which we didn't
[05:14] um have in uh let's say 2020
[05:18] 2021 uh and that's due primarily to
[05:20] these us
[05:22] ETFs um as we know a lot of the
[05:25] financial world is based in the US a lot
[05:29] of the capital in the US these big um
[05:33] institutions um like Fidelity Black Rock
[05:37] um and all these other ones which have
[05:40] trillions and trillions of dollars in
[05:42] assets I mean Black Rock has over 9.1
[05:45] trillion and Fidelity something like 7
[05:47] trillion so all of these this massive
[05:50] amount of
[05:51] capital uh which is invested into
[05:53] various funds ETFs stocks and shares all
[05:57] that sort of stuff uh and now because we
[06:00] had the launch of these um ETFs in
[06:03] January now there's finally a a pipeline
[06:07] or a method for um these traditional
[06:10] financial institutions to get into
[06:12] Bitcoin so that is really a trigger uh
[06:16] to what Michael sailor calls the the uh
[06:19] the Bitcoin Gold Rush that will last 10
[06:21] years um which I quoted in my article um
[06:26] so yeah this massive institutional
[06:30] adoption that's going to take place
[06:32] we're really only at the beginning of it
[06:35] um but it will continue for many years
[06:38] to
[06:38] come uh and a lot of that uh that
[06:42] capital is going to stay in Bitcoin it's
[06:44] not just sort of coming in and out um
[06:48] and then uh this third factor which I
[06:51] wanted to touch on was the uh infinite
[06:54] feedback loop um and this sort of
[06:58] touches with uh ties in with the uh the
[07:01] concept of the financial Singularity so
[07:03] this idea that um Bitcoin is like a a
[07:07] black hole it's like a singularity that
[07:10] sucks in all the capital um from various
[07:15] assets uh because Mo most assets at the
[07:17] moment are basically trying to um
[07:22] maintain value or increase value where
[07:25] possible against this Rising tide of
[07:28] inflation as currencies are being
[07:30] consistently
[07:31] debased uh investors and individuals
[07:34] have to find a place to put their wealth
[07:38] um so many of them put it into the stock
[07:42] market uh S&P
[07:44] 500 uh they put it into various index
[07:49] funds attached to that real estate of
[07:52] course is one of the biggest um stores
[07:54] of value that people use now uh either
[07:58] investing in property or just in their
[08:00] own home some people it's just their own
[08:02] house is is their store of value which
[08:04] they can sort of borrow against and Etc
[08:07] but um a lot of that wealth uh
[08:11] inevitably I think will flow into
[08:14] Bitcoin um and the housing market real
[08:17] estate will be
[08:20] um it'll lose its place as a store of
[08:23] value over time and we'll eventually get
[08:25] the sort of more utility value of uh of
[08:28] Real Estate
[08:30] um so yeah that's the sort of financial
[08:33] Singularity and this feedback loop of
[08:35] course as the uh the Bitcoin network uh
[08:39] expands uh more and more users uh are
[08:42] adopting Bitcoin uh as the network
[08:45] expands the price expands as the price
[08:48] expands uh more people get into it and
[08:50] there's also an increase in security as
[08:53] uh more people are mining it more
[08:55] companies are mining it uh the hash rate
[08:57] goes up so um it becomes a secur network
[09:01] a better Network for storing value a
[09:03] stronger monetary uh Network and harder
[09:05] asset over time so this is the sort of
[09:08] General uh pattern these are sort of the
[09:11] general things that uh I see are leading
[09:14] us towards um 1 million and then it's
[09:18] just a question of how fast and I think
[09:21] as if if we continue to witness um the
[09:26] current uh sort of inflow of capital
[09:29] um we could easily see a $1 million
[09:33] Bitcoin uh within um possibly near the
[09:37] end of of this cycle maybe even you know
[09:41] 2027 uh or even earlier if the amount of
[09:44] capital increases rapidly uh let's say
[09:47] the double inflows from the uh in into
[09:51] the current ETFs then we could see it um
[09:54] even uh you know in the next several
[09:57] years you know two three years possibly
[10:00] uh I'm not sort of guaranteeing any of
[10:02] that uh this is you know it's sort of a
[10:04] wild prediction but you know it's just
[10:06] based on what I can see at the moment
[10:09] things can change you know as we can see
[10:11] even with geopolitical events things
[10:13] have changed since uh last week when we
[10:15] were trying to uh record this interview
[10:17] so you know um there's a lot of factors
[10:21] you know there was the covid crash that
[10:23] nobody predicted where Bitcoin went down
[10:25] to like 3 to
[10:26] 4,000 uh you know in 2020 and now we've
[10:30] just had a crash uh due to geopolitical
[10:33] tensions so there's a lot of stuff that
[10:35] you can't predict and there's no
[10:37] guarantee that flows will continue at
[10:39] the current rates or will increase but I
[10:42] don't see any reason why they shouldn't
[10:45] uh increase due to this positive
[10:48] feedback loop due to this the fact that
[10:50] Bitcoin is a avbl and good so yeah we
[10:52] could um get there faster than um many
[10:56] people
[10:57] anticipate um
[11:00] and that could lead to potentially a
[11:03] super cycle uh which people have been
[11:05] talking about for a number of years now
[11:08] um but we saw the same thing happen with
[11:11] the gold ETFs when they were launched in
[11:14] uh I think it was around
[11:17] 2004 um you know once once those ETFs
[11:20] were launched gold sort of you know shot
[11:23] off on this roughly eight-year uh super
[11:26] cycle going up and up and up and now
[11:28] gold is
[11:30] uh higher than it was even at the peak
[11:31] of that uh that that super cycle so uh
[11:36] you know we'll see what happens but but
[11:38] this is how I how I see it happening uh
[11:40] over the next let's say you know five to
[11:43] eight years yeah it's an amazing because
[11:47] I think um we never have seen so much
[11:50] inflow of capital coming to bitcoin with
[11:54] let's just think what the last four
[11:56] years have been what the last four years
[11:58] uh came to to the in the last cycle we
[12:02] got the publicly traded companies with
[12:04] Michael sailor coming in we did not had
[12:06] that before we have countries now where
[12:09] the leader of the country is
[12:11] posting about Bitcoin and is buying
[12:13] Bitcoin on a s seemingly daily basis and
[12:17] is building uh Bitcoin bonds and stuff
[12:19] like that this will have some effects
[12:22] that uh because they also really
[12:24] successful and I think they will be even
[12:25] more successful in the long run um this
[12:28] will have followers other countries that
[12:31] come into then the ETFs are coming in as
[12:33] you said uh and then we have even more
[12:38] uh stuff uh afterwards that probably we
[12:41] don't even know about I think Peter
[12:43] dunworth is talking about that um
[12:46] Structured Products are coming in uh
[12:48] bonds are coming in uh products that we
[12:51] don't even have on the radar right now
[12:53] and then there's all the Pension funds
[12:55] that are unlocked with the ETFs there
[12:57] are so much capital
[13:00] is kind of waiting now to get into
[13:03] Bitcoin and is flowing into Bitcoin in
[13:05] the next like 3 four five and like even
[13:09] longer like the next 10 years but
[13:11] especially the next two three four years
[13:14] I imagine like this capital inflow in
[13:16] Bitcoin just rising up so so fast and uh
[13:20] one aspect we did not cover uh from from
[13:23] now is the the the mental Milestones how
[13:28] much uh does like a 100K bitcoin price
[13:32] 500k Bitcoin price one million bitcoin
[13:34] price then also in influence uh the the
[13:38] whole whole game theory when uh every
[13:41] news like because people have this
[13:44] mindset oh it reached at 7K like 2021 I
[13:48] think most people have this like in
[13:50] their mind uh most people also know oh
[13:52] it's not that far away that we hit the
[13:55] 10K uh when we hit them when we actually
[13:58] see the mainstream
[13:59] but I think a lot of capital will be
[14:01] unlocked and a lot of fear of missing
[14:03] out from the general population that are
[14:05] not in Bitcoin will be unlocked when
[14:08] once we hit this this 100K weird Target
[14:12] Milestone uh what do you think can be
[14:14] the the significance of of of that 100K
[14:19] milone yeah I think you know a lot of it
[14:21] is psychological the markets are very
[14:23] psychological you know and there's
[14:25] there's fear of missing out everyone
[14:26] wants to Pile in and you know this does
[14:29] relate to what what I was saying about
[14:30] the VIN good concept because there's
[14:33] that Meme in Bitcoin where you know
[14:36] there there's there's two sort of cues
[14:38] to buy Bitcoin you know one is where
[14:41] Bitcoin is like
[14:43] $116,000 and the other is where it's
[14:44] like
[14:45] $70,000 and there's like hardly anyone
[14:49] uh trying to buy Bitcoin at 16,000 but
[14:52] everybody there's a massive long queue
[14:53] of people trying to buy Bitcoin at
[14:56] 70,000 you know and the reason for that
[14:59] is because you it's it is that
[15:01] psychological fear of of missing out and
[15:03] seeing you know this is that that
[15:06] amazing you know asset that's just going
[15:08] up you know we need we need to get a
[15:10] hold of this it's now 70,000 so the same
[15:12] thing will happen obviously when Bitcoin
[15:14] is a
[15:16] 100,000 uh you know people are going to
[15:18] get crazy because they'll think wow I
[15:20] mean uh you know this thing was uh what
[15:23] at the bottom of the last cycle like you
[15:25] know 15 16,000 now it's 100,000 oh my
[15:28] God if I don't get some of this you know
[15:30] what if it's going to a million so there
[15:33] is that I think that definitely affects
[15:36] um uh the retail Market you know the
[15:38] average sort of person at the moment I
[15:41] think a lot of retail isn't paying
[15:42] attention uh to bitcoin even when when
[15:45] it was hitting a new all-time high of
[15:47] around 73 to
[15:49] 74,000 I don't think a lot of retail was
[15:51] paying attention um so yeah we do have
[15:54] to hit some more sort of psychological
[15:57] Milestones before people start paying
[16:00] attention because just as like 10,000
[16:02] was um you know a major Milestone back
[16:06] in let's say 2017 you know and that sort
[16:08] of kicked things off and people were
[16:10] like oh my God Bitcoin is uh
[16:12] $10,000 doar I need to get some of this
[16:15] and of course then it shot up to uh
[16:18] roughly
[16:19] 20,000 and then crashed I mean it was
[16:22] only at 20,000 for a very tiny you know
[16:25] brief Speck of time but that was sort of
[16:28] the the hyperb
[16:29] uh blowoff top um I think this last
[16:34] cycle the 2020
[16:36] 2021 um cycle I think we didn't quite
[16:41] have as much of the fomo a as we had in
[16:45] in 2017 you know when you even when you
[16:47] look at the charts I think it was sort
[16:50] of a disappointing cycle in a way it was
[16:52] very disappointing for me um I mean not
[16:55] just for um you know even those who are
[16:57] following sort of plan B's predictions
[16:59] you know he had two sets of predictions
[17:02] one where it was going to hit an average
[17:04] of 50,000 his original and then his
[17:07] second was that it would have an average
[17:09] of 100,000 and we sort of never reached
[17:12] the um uh the second version of his
[17:15] model and a lot of people were anyway
[17:17] even you know independent of of his
[17:19] models were hoping that we'd reach that
[17:22] next order of magnitude because you know
[17:24] it seems that Bitcoin keeps going up an
[17:25] order of magnitude every cycle from the
[17:28] one ,000 sort of limit and then the
[17:31] 10,000 limit and then people assumed
[17:34] naturally we'd hit 100,000 in the
[17:37] previous cycle so a lot of people were
[17:39] kind of disappointed and there's
[17:40] probably a lot of reasons for that you
[17:42] know with the sort of China um mining
[17:45] situation and the various FTX collapse
[17:48] and then blockfi and all these other
[17:51] Celsius various collapses and things so
[17:54] I think it was a very strange time as
[17:56] well with covid um but I do
[18:01] suspect um that this cycle will be quite
[18:04] different um especially with the
[18:07] financial institutions on board and I
[18:09] think even the financial institutions
[18:12] themselves will get a bit of uh fomo as
[18:15] uh as the price goes up so yeah once we
[18:17] hit that 100,000 I think it's a very
[18:20] important psychological level and uh
[18:23] from there we could easily see it you
[18:25] know doubling tripling you know
[18:28] quadrupling quadrupling in value uh
[18:31] potentially within this cycle uh I mean
[18:34] some people you know talk about 150,000
[18:37] I think it's way too conservative for a
[18:40] top for for this cycle uh you know
[18:43] 150,000 I think we just getting
[18:45] started um you know some people say
[18:48] 300,000 or 400,000 I think uh plan B's
[18:52] is something in the
[18:54] 500,000 uh in his prediction but I mean
[18:58] any thing within that range is possible
[19:01] certainly you know if we keep hitting
[19:04] 100,000 targets uh each one of those
[19:08] will have a very I think important
[19:10] psychological effect you know if it went
[19:12] from 100,000 to 200,000
[19:14] doubled uh people would you know really
[19:18] fomo in imagine it goes from 200,000 to
[19:20] 300,000 or 300,000 to
[19:23] 400,000 um so yeah I think each one of
[19:26] those is going to be uh quite important
[19:31] uh on the path to a million and who
[19:33] knows you know if we hit a million this
[19:35] cycle that that would be extraordinary I
[19:37] mean this it's not uh guaranteed uh but
[19:42] if we hit a million even the next cycle
[19:44] you know 2028 uh you know that's quite
[19:47] possible as well 2028
[19:49] 2029 um but
[19:52] yeah yeah amazing it's it's it's so true
[19:56] when you look back at the 2020 and in
[19:59] one cycle um we had so much TR I mean I
[20:02] heard a lot of people when I asked like
[20:04] how did you came in and stuff like that
[20:05] I think a lot of people actually came in
[20:07] the 2020 area because not only because
[20:10] of the priz but also because they
[20:12] finally had time to read stuff they
[20:16] finally had time at home and sitting and
[20:18] doing stuff I heard that so many times
[20:21] in like even friend circles and online
[20:24] and in in podcast interviews where
[20:27] they're like uh this was this whole red
[20:30] race of you're in your life and you do
[20:32] stuff and then all of the sudden Co hit
[20:35] and you were forced to sit at home um
[20:38] which but I think was bad but it has
[20:41] also some some good effects on society
[20:44] because people all of the sudden had
[20:45] time to pick up a book that they did not
[20:48] had before they had time to to research
[20:51] about stuff that they did not had before
[20:53] so I think I don't know if Co was a good
[20:55] or bad for Bitcoin in the end of the day
[20:58] it was it does not matter long run but I
[21:01] don't know if it was in the short run
[21:02] good or bad uh probably it was was good
[21:05] because the US dollar was devalued at a
[21:08] rapid Pace way way much faster than
[21:11] before and people had the time to think
[21:13] of of that stuff and that was actually a
[21:14] topic and I think this inflation trigger
[21:17] this is this is another aspect of the
[21:20] price running up that we did not cover
[21:22] till now um the US dollar not only we
[21:25] have more capital inflows and more uh
[21:29] um Market that and purchasing power that
[21:32] Bitcoin covers but also the unit that we
[21:36] measuring in right now the US dollar is
[21:38] just devaluing at a rapid Pace how do
[21:41] you how do you see inflation and uh this
[21:44] all playing into in the long run like
[21:46] five 10 15 years in the fear currency
[21:49] because some people say oh it we can
[21:52] have hyperinflation in like five years
[21:55] we can hit hyper inflation only in like
[21:57] 50 years um there are a lot of different
[22:00] aspects I even had a guest on that said
[22:02] we will hit hyperinflation in the US
[22:04] dollar in three years which I find a
[22:07] little aggressive but yeah I will not
[22:10] rule it out because if you print a lot
[22:12] of money a lot of things can happen how
[22:14] do you see that aspect playing into
[22:18] priz yeah I mean I sort of covered this
[22:20] a bit more in some of my previous
[22:22] articles like the uh the case for the 10
[22:25] million Bitcoin that I wrote um in I
[22:29] think it was 2021 um yeah so I was sort
[22:32] of looking more at the um the factors
[22:35] that make Bitcoin
[22:37] important um and where it will sort of
[22:40] go in the ultimate long-term trajectory
[22:44] because I think um essentially Bitcoin
[22:47] is on a path to hyperbitcoinization
[22:50] um and that will mean um all currencies
[22:55] essentially trending to uh to zero
[22:58] unless of course they're backed by
[22:59] Bitcoin uh which is a possibility that
[23:01] that would be sort of the the only kind
[23:03] of Escape valve for the US dollar is if
[23:06] they say let's let's put this on a
[23:08] Bitcoin standard you know $1 is uh you
[23:12] know let's say one Satoshi or 10 satosi
[23:14] or something like that and we just fix
[23:16] it at that price then of course the US
[23:18] dollar will stop uh inflating and we'll
[23:21] have a fixed
[23:22] Supply um so that's a possibility you
[23:25] could eventually have a strong very
[23:27] strong dollar if it's back by a hard
[23:29] asset and I don't think that we're going
[23:31] to go back to Gold uh gold has sort of
[23:34] failed um as a uh as a backing for
[23:38] currency I know they're trying to do it
[23:40] I think it's in Zimbabwe now they're
[23:42] trying to reset their currency again uh
[23:45] this time somehow backing it with gold
[23:48] but I I saw they were backing with gold
[23:50] and other currencies or something like
[23:52] that which obviously wouldn't help
[23:54] because other currencies are all pegged
[23:55] to the Petro dollar and the P dollar is
[23:58] infl ating to Infinity so any attempt
[24:01] this is the other thing I don't get
[24:02] about stable coins I mean there's no
[24:04] such thing as a stable coin because it's
[24:06] stable in comparison to what you know if
[24:09] the US dollar is inflating and stable
[24:12] coins are pegged to the US dollar it's
[24:14] not exactly stable it has the illusion
[24:17] of stability because people think $1
[24:20] equals
[24:21] $1 but $1 uh is is never $1 because it's
[24:26] you know the dollar has lost maybe 9
[24:29] 7% or 98% of its value since uh well
[24:32] since the beginning of the 20th century
[24:35] uh when it was on a gold standard a hard
[24:37] gold standard uh but it's been sort of
[24:40] debased and continually re either reped
[24:44] to a different amount of gold as as they
[24:46] were doing with the various world wars
[24:48] at the beginning of the 20th century or
[24:50] completely taken off the gold standard
[24:53] uh by Nixon
[24:54] temporarily uh in 1971 which they've
[24:57] never reversed even though it's supposed
[24:59] to be
[25:01] temporary um so you know the the US
[25:04] dollar is ultimately on a destructive
[25:08] path and uh it looks like the US uh is
[25:13] stable uh it looks like the US will
[25:16] remain this this um superpower you know
[25:19] there's always been talk of China taking
[25:21] over and that sort of thing and the
[25:23] Chinese currency um but in reality every
[25:28] Empire or every superpower is stable
[25:31] until it isn't um and we saw that with
[25:35] the Roman Empire uh which seemed to be
[25:38] permanent and had a permanent currency
[25:41] and permanent control uh but once they
[25:43] started messing with their currency uh
[25:46] once they started debasing removing the
[25:48] amount well gradually decreasing the
[25:50] amount of
[25:51] silver in the I think it's the the
[25:54] Denarius you know gradually had less and
[25:56] less and less silver until it had almost
[25:59] no silver at all uh and then they had to
[26:02] introduce price
[26:04] controls um and force people to remain
[26:07] in the same job and to only charge
[26:10] certain amount certain amounts of money
[26:11] for certain products um and all these
[26:14] other economic controls that we we see
[26:17] being implemented today by various
[26:20] governments um eventually uh Rome faced
[26:24] systemic collapse uh and The Barbarians
[26:27] took over and all their systems went to
[26:30] nothing and their currency went to
[26:31] nothing and then other currencies harder
[26:34] currencies had to replace it later on I
[26:37] think even with the US dollar you know
[26:39] we saw with the beginning of the US
[26:40] dollar you know they had the Continental
[26:43] dollar uh in during the um American
[26:47] Revolution uh and then that Continental
[26:50] dollar was backed by nothing so it went
[26:52] to almost nothing in value such that
[26:55] they had the phrase not worth a
[26:57] continental which means not worth you
[26:59] know anything really uh and then that
[27:01] was replaced by a a biim metallic sort
[27:04] of gold silver
[27:06] standard and then in uh the Civil War uh
[27:10] you know they had to spend huge amounts
[27:13] of money to you know fight the the
[27:16] Confederacy so they uh they took the US
[27:19] off the gold standard and printed green
[27:21] backs Lincoln printed the green backs uh
[27:24] which were massively inflated and then
[27:27] after that they had to go back to the
[27:28] biim metallic standard and eventually
[27:30] more of a gold standard so every time uh
[27:34] you've had a fiat currency pure fiat
[27:36] currency eventually it has become so
[27:39] debased that you've had to go back to a
[27:42] hard money
[27:43] standard um except for the last let's
[27:47] say 40 50 years uh of this this current
[27:52] experiment with the uh the Petro dollar
[27:55] uh but that will eventually come to end
[27:58] and it it it could even be a very sudden
[28:01] end um and of course they'll try and uh
[28:05] prevent that through cbdc Central Bank
[28:07] digital currencies they'll create some
[28:10] sort of digital currency that uh they
[28:13] control and they can monitor and make
[28:15] sure that uh you know you're actually
[28:17] spending it maybe forcing you to spend
[28:19] it somehow or it expires it you know you
[28:22] have maybe one year to spend it or the
[28:24] currency disappears or something like
[28:26] that they'll come up with way around it
[28:29] but that's similar to the various
[28:31] attempts I was mentioning about the the
[28:33] Romans how they tried to prop up their
[28:36] currency and you know prevent people
[28:38] from spending you know more than a
[28:40] certain amount and but all these kind of
[28:43] uh economic controls are ultimately
[28:47] unnatural and they ultimately fail
[28:49] because the free market uh prevails in
[28:52] the end so the US dollar um I think uh
[28:57] is going to continue to um rapidly lose
[29:01] value um especially with um the
[29:05] incentives that that currently exist um
[29:08] to spend money on War uh to buy
[29:11] armaments to send to Ukraine you know
[29:14] all these various um big government
[29:17] projects student loan
[29:19] forgiveness um massive budgets uh even
[29:23] servicing the uh the current debt you
[29:26] know the current debt in the US is is
[29:29] getting
[29:30] unmanageable uh where the you know I'm
[29:33] not following it entirely at the moment
[29:35] but I think at some point the um the
[29:37] interest alone will be you know trillion
[29:40] dollars so when the that itself is a
[29:43] sort of feedback loop um but it's it's a
[29:45] negative feedback loop that's going to
[29:47] continue uh destroying the currency
[29:49] until it it becomes so unsustainable the
[29:52] debt becomes so unsustainable the
[29:54] deficit the interest on that becomes
[29:56] unsustainable
[29:58] um and they do have to have some kind of
[30:00] reset but if you have a reset you need
[30:02] to reset it with something hard
[30:04] something that uh actually has value and
[30:08] at the moment the only real alternative
[30:11] to the dollar is Bitcoin I told you a
[30:13] lot about 21 Bitcoin the best place for
[30:16] me to buy Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin
[30:19] only exchange but now let's talk about
[30:21] how to secure your Bitcoin once you got
[30:24] Bitcoin you don't want to leave them on
[30:25] Exchange you want to take self custody
[30:29] you want to take responsibility of your
[30:31] own Bitcoin that's why I recommend
[30:34] getting a bitbox bitbox is an amazing
[30:37] wallet where you can not only keep your
[30:40] Bitcoin in a simple way very secure you
[30:43] can even create a passphrase with that
[30:46] passphrase you can basically create a
[30:48] hidden wallet on the device itself make
[30:52] sure to buy your bit box in the link
[30:55] down in the description and with code
[30:57] Robin you even get a 5% discount Absolut
[31:01] that was an an amazing Randal
[31:04] ofed um and there are so many great
[31:06] topics in there there's like gold in
[31:08] there which uh I think is great money
[31:11] till Bitcoin came along um then we also
[31:15] have the topic of cbdcs which I covered
[31:18] sometimes on on the podcast uh and I had
[31:21] quite uh different opinions on that if
[31:23] it's uh accelerating or slowing down the
[31:26] Bitcoin adoption I'm personally think it
[31:29] could actually be an acceleration for
[31:31] Bitcoin adoption because the government
[31:32] is telling the general population that
[31:35] something digital has value uh and it
[31:38] makes the Fiat system just way worse
[31:41] because there's more monitoring more
[31:43] control uh in the end probably also more
[31:45] devaluation going on how do you see
[31:48] cbdcs playing into the adoption of of of
[31:52] Bitcoin yeah I mean well at the moment
[31:54] you know cbdcs are sort of a Known
[31:56] Unknown as they say because it's very
[32:00] difficult to say what they will look
[32:02] like what they will be like I we've had
[32:05] sort of indications uh from I think the
[32:08] EU the European Central Bank about their
[32:11] cbdc being uh something that doesn't
[32:15] they're intending that it doesn't
[32:17] compete with the Euro uh and I'm not
[32:19] sure how that's supposed to work I mean
[32:21] if it's supposed to be something where
[32:22] you only uh you can only spend it and
[32:26] you don't save it or there's Capital
[32:29] limits on how much you can have or how
[32:31] much you can use um it it sort of makes
[32:33] it almost pointless um but if you need a
[32:36] cbdc to actually step in and replace the
[32:40] existing currency uh I mean that may
[32:43] have to happen if the currency does
[32:46] start to
[32:47] hyperinflate um or simply become
[32:50] unsustainable as we see in every other
[32:52] country that's that's faced uh
[32:54] hyperinflation they've had to revalue
[32:57] the currency they've had to say
[32:59] something like one you know one old
[33:02] dollar is uh no let's say one a thousand
[33:05] old dollars is now one new dollar
[33:07] something like that so you could you
[33:08] could do that with a cbdc and say well
[33:11] now we're switching from you know the
[33:13] existing US dollar to the cbdc and uh
[33:17] you know 100
[33:18] hundred you know physical US dollars are
[33:21] now you know one cbdc dollar whatever
[33:24] they want to call it you know new
[33:26] digital dollar or new dollar something
[33:28] like that or fed note or whatever they
[33:30] call it so I think it can be useful for
[33:33] the US government in terms of revaluing
[33:36] the currency or trying to reset it
[33:38] whether or not that'll be successful is
[33:41] another question um but I think the
[33:44] control aspect is also a very
[33:46] interesting one if if they can make sure
[33:49] that not only will they monitor
[33:51] everything that you spend uh what you
[33:54] spend on you know how much you spend on
[33:56] certain things that'll great statistics
[33:58] to the government as to uh how they can
[34:01] try to Central plan or in a sort of
[34:04] socialist way try to top down manage the
[34:07] economy uh which always
[34:10] fails um but also if they can
[34:14] control uh you know how long you can
[34:18] hold those notes uh those digital notes
[34:22] um whether you have to spend them
[34:25] because there's this whole concept
[34:26] within mainstream economics or Kian
[34:29] economics that uh the economy is only
[34:32] working correctly if everyone is
[34:34] spending and everyone needs to spend
[34:36] more for the economy to grow and that's
[34:39] a good thing so you know it's great if
[34:42] if people are constantly you know
[34:44] replacing their phones every year if if
[34:46] they're replacing their laptops every
[34:47] year if everything is disposable
[34:49] everything is poor quality so that you
[34:51] can you know just buy a new one throw
[34:54] away the old one don't fix it just buy a
[34:56] brand new one it's sort of the Broken
[34:57] Window Theory well if you just break
[34:59] everyone's Windows that'll spur on the
[35:01] economy because then you'll need to
[35:03] replace all the windows you need to pay
[35:05] someone to come and install a new window
[35:08] and that creates economic growth so we
[35:10] might as well break everyone's Windows
[35:11] that's a sort of keian logic of of
[35:14] mainstream economics so a cbdc can be
[35:18] very useful in that because they could
[35:21] say well we don't need to just uh you
[35:23] know encourage people to to buy things
[35:27] we can just force them to buy things
[35:29] because if they don't spend their
[35:31] digital dollars within you know one year
[35:35] uh the digital dollar will uh you know
[35:37] disappear it'll go back to the
[35:39] government or or the the whatever the
[35:41] Federal Reserve or whoever creates the
[35:43] uh the digital dollars um that you
[35:46] you'll be penalized somehow maybe they
[35:47] can introduce negative interest rates
[35:50] and say well if you hold on to it that's
[35:52] fine but uh you'll lose um 10% uh every
[35:56] year you know know uh so you you'll be
[35:59] again penalized for saving for holding
[36:02] on to dollars so there's there's many
[36:04] ways they can try and manipulate and
[36:06] control it's sort of a um a
[36:09] dystopian uh reality really will it help
[36:12] Bitcoin I I think yes uh because Bitcoin
[36:16] doesn't do that so so if you're holding
[36:19] Bitcoin it's something they can't touch
[36:21] and it's also something that uh actually
[36:24] uh doesn't debase and retains its value
[36:27] or increases in value over time despite
[36:30] whatever short-term volatility may exist
[36:33] um so people will flock to that uh asset
[36:37] which protects them which allows them to
[36:39] save and preserve their wealth uh in
[36:42] spite of um whatever dystopian central
[36:46] government planning may
[36:48] exist amazing uh and uh you touched on
[36:52] that uh topic a little bit earlier uh
[36:55] about financial singularity
[36:58] but I think um some might have questions
[37:01] like what do you exactly mean with
[37:03] financial sing singularity in in aspect
[37:06] to bitcoin so let's let's maybe dive a
[37:09] little bit uh into that topic what is
[37:11] financial Singularity and how is it like
[37:14] connected to to
[37:16] bitcoin yeah um I think everything
[37:21] converges on a point um certainly in
[37:24] terms of monetary assets uh this is
[37:27] something that that um I think safeer
[37:29] deine mentions in the Bitcoin standard
[37:32] and also in his uh his new book uh
[37:35] principles of economics as well that um
[37:39] certainly in terms of money there's a
[37:41] winner takes all um scenario so people
[37:46] think that you know every country must
[37:48] have its own individual currency every
[37:50] country must have its own money uh but
[37:53] historically that's not always been the
[37:56] case um and certainly in the 19th
[37:59] century uh by by the end of the 19th
[38:01] century let's say 1880s
[38:04] 1890s um you had the US dollar you had
[38:07] the pound you had the Frank and all
[38:09] these other uh currencies in different
[38:12] countries but really um as saine points
[38:16] out these are all sort of denominations
[38:18] of gold in a sense they're just
[38:20] different ways of measuring gold uh
[38:22] because gold due to its various
[38:25] qualities uh and the fact that could um
[38:28] by the 19th century they they'd found
[38:30] ways of ensuring that um uh you could
[38:34] actually use small amounts of gold in
[38:37] the same way that silver had supplied
[38:38] that purpose in the past uh through
[38:41] various financial
[38:43] instruments um you could actually uh you
[38:47] had an asset that could be used
[38:49] internationally across the world so
[38:51] anyone anywhere in the world could save
[38:54] their wealth in Gold transport it
[38:56] through uh let's say you know uh notes
[39:00] that are backed by gold anywhere in the
[39:02] world without without actually having to
[39:04] to carry the physical gold um and uh and
[39:08] spend that and you could store your
[39:10] value throughout time so gold was this
[39:12] convergence point this Singularity of of
[39:16] currency uh that prevailed um at one
[39:20] time so there was only one real currency
[39:22] that that had value uh by the end of the
[39:25] 19th century now the uh at the current
[39:30] uh time we have many different
[39:31] currencies most of them are in one way
[39:34] or another uh connected with the Petro
[39:37] dollar even if not directly um you know
[39:41] whatever happens to the P dollar tends
[39:43] to effect have a KnockOn effect on all
[39:46] the other currencies and there's
[39:47] actually a number of currencies which
[39:48] are currently pegged to or connected
[39:52] with the dollar somehow I mean even El
[39:54] Salvador um as much as they've allowed
[39:56] Bitcoin going to uh be legal tender
[40:00] they're basically using the dollar uh
[40:02] most of the time as their currency so
[40:04] the US dollar has become this kind of um
[40:08] you know uh single point uh that
[40:11] everyone's agreed on uh across the world
[40:13] at the moment um but at the same time
[40:17] financially there are many different
[40:19] assets as we've mentioned that people
[40:20] are storing their wealth in so people
[40:22] aren't storing their wealth in the
[40:24] dollar they're storing it in real estate
[40:26] and very ious other financial
[40:28] instruments and the S&P 500 all the
[40:31] stock markets and everything um so the
[40:35] financial Singularity is really where
[40:37] all of that converges on a single point
[40:40] not just currency but also assets so the
[40:45] uh the current wealth that is being
[40:47] stored in the in in real estate uh will
[40:51] flow out into that Singularity so as
[40:56] Bitcoin comes as people realize that it
[41:00] is much better to store your wealth than
[41:04] in houses uh in a market that could
[41:07] easily crash and something which could
[41:09] easily be uh inflated through the
[41:11] production of new houses uh when people
[41:14] realize that uh real estate is not the
[41:16] best store of value but that Bitcoin uh
[41:19] is the best store of value and the
[41:21] hardest asset that will ever exist um
[41:24] the current financialization of real
[41:27] estate will end and that those trillions
[41:30] of dollars of wealth will flow into
[41:33] Bitcoin the same thing with the stock
[41:34] market the stock market of course uh
[41:36] represents companies and Company you'll
[41:39] always have to have Equity uh in
[41:42] companies but again the stock market is
[41:45] being used uh as a store of value
[41:48] Pension funds uh
[41:50] individuals um are storing their wealth
[41:53] in the stock market and even as it's
[41:55] going up this is something that Michael
[41:57] sailor points out it's going up you know
[41:59] whatever percent uh per anom but a lot
[42:02] of that is just keeping up with
[42:04] inflation uh the stock market is a hedge
[42:07] against inflation because you might as
[42:09] well put your money into an S&P 500
[42:13] Index rather than storing it in your
[42:15] bank account as US dollars so again that
[42:19] that wealth will also flow out from uh
[42:23] the S&P 500 and the other the rest of
[42:25] the stock market into Bitcoin and now we
[42:28] have that channel for that to happen
[42:30] through the
[42:31] ETFs uh so uh it'll come from all of
[42:35] these different aspects all of these
[42:37] different methods of saving including
[42:39] gold as well I mean gold itself uh you
[42:41] know is is something like a 10 trillion
[42:44] dollar asset so it's at least uh you
[42:47] know 10 times the size of of Bitcoin if
[42:50] not more um but that a lot of that
[42:54] wealth that is stored in Gold will again
[42:56] flow into Bitcoin uh because it serves
[42:59] the same purpose as gold but even better
[43:02] so I see at some point um everything
[43:06] converging you know all of these
[43:08] different uh uh methods of storing
[43:12] wealth will Converge on a single store
[43:14] of wealth and that will essentially def
[43:17] financialized um many of these assets uh
[43:20] and and will actually in a sense make
[43:23] finance a lot simpler because now if you
[43:25] if you want to preserve wealth you have
[43:27] each each person has to sort of be you
[43:29] know looking at the stock market how are
[43:31] things going you know what you know
[43:32] should I buy another house should I
[43:34] mortgage my existing house you know but
[43:37] once you have one simple hard asset you
[43:40] essentially def financialized you remove
[43:42] the need for financial advisors their
[43:44] their job becomes
[43:46] obsolete you don't need any of these
[43:48] existing funds hedge funds index indices
[43:52] all of that goes out the window and all
[43:54] you need is Bitcoin
[43:58] it's it's it's amazing and I think this
[44:00] is you basically described not a way to
[44:03] have a bit conization where we use
[44:05] Bitcoin as the base layer of our
[44:07] financial system where everybody knows
[44:10] Bitcoin is the place where I can store
[44:13] uh my money and this is the beautiful
[44:15] thing because um I was a stock investor
[44:18] before Bitcoin I pick stocked like
[44:20] individual stocks not SM me 500 and I
[44:23] was for some reason quite successful in
[44:26] it I think uh mostly to the LA because I
[44:28] did not know what I'm doing there uh but
[44:31] even though I I was good in it just from
[44:34] um performance-based thing um people
[44:37] came up to me and asked me question how
[44:38] do you do that how do you do that and I
[44:40] came to know then later that all the
[44:43] things uh that they wanted is not to
[44:46] know how to pick stocks they wanted to
[44:48] know how to secure your financial energy
[44:52] uh and everybody has this problem this
[44:54] is why families are buying houses this
[44:57] is why uh people buy the S&P 500 and and
[45:01] ETFs and stuff like that and as you just
[45:03] perfectly described it this all will
[45:05] flow at some point to bitcoin and we
[45:07] have this uh hyperbitcoinization
[45:10] um was also an interesting uh for
[45:13] experiment and I'm I'm curious to know
[45:15] what you think about that when we have
[45:17] this Singularity what are the um
[45:20] consequences of that like what are what
[45:23] is coming after hyper bit censation how
[45:25] does the the world
[45:27] um change because of that or does it
[45:30] even
[45:31] change yeah it's a good question I mean
[45:33] it's something that uh a lot of people
[45:35] have thought about um certainly uh
[45:38] safeer deine mentions it in uh the
[45:40] Bitcoin standard quite eloquently um but
[45:44] essentially you know um I think
[45:48] that we go back in a sense to a sort
[45:53] of golden age of of hard money uh
[45:57] something I've mentioned a couple of my
[45:58] articles that I think that
[46:01] um uh there are certain things that
[46:04] we've lost that maybe we don't realize
[46:06] we've lost um for example a focus on
[46:09] quality over quantity um now everything
[46:15] is sort of mass produced U to a certain
[46:19] quality to ensure that it's cheap uh but
[46:22] also needs to be replaceable so for
[46:25] example you know you'll have an Ikea
[46:27] desk or something which is cheap but
[46:30] it's made of chipboard you know it
[46:32] easily breaks it doesn't last very long
[46:35] you know I need to buy a new one in five
[46:37] years um the same with houses I mean
[46:40] houses especially in the US are built
[46:43] cheaply but not of very good quality you
[46:47] know most of the good houses I mean
[46:48] certainly in the UK you know houses a
[46:51] lot of our housing stock is you know 100
[46:53] years old and fairly good quality but
[46:56] the new stuff is is not as good quality
[46:59] so everything is in a in a kind of
[47:01] decline at the moment uh quality of
[47:04] everything goes down um and also the way
[47:07] that we think about things we don't we
[47:09] don't plan for the long term now we we
[47:12] tend to plan for short term because
[47:14] everything is about what's happening
[47:16] next what's the next thing nobody's
[47:18] thinking you know what what will I do
[47:21] 100 you know 50 years from now what will
[47:23] my grandchildren do what will my
[47:24] children do um what's the future that
[47:27] that they will have so I think um you
[47:31] know fiat currency encourages this
[47:34] because it makes us make those snap
[47:36] decisions we have to spend our money now
[47:38] we don't save for the future so when we
[47:40] have a hard money standard people will
[47:43] start saving again so instead of
[47:46] investing they'll be saving they'll use
[47:48] that money to provide a legacy for their
[47:52] their children and their grandchildren
[47:54] they will use the money to build
[47:56] business and grow businesses again even
[47:59] with business now we've converged on
[48:01] these massive you know super
[48:03] corporations that control everything and
[48:06] the small businessman has disappeared in
[48:09] many cases because uh there's no
[48:12] incentive uh for small business and
[48:15] nobody can save up Capital no one can
[48:17] save up Capital to start a business no
[48:19] one can save up Capital to um provide
[48:22] for their future to buy a house to pay
[48:24] for Education uh you know there wouldn't
[48:27] be so much of a focus on student loan
[48:30] forgiveness if people could simply save
[48:32] up for their studies but now everything
[48:34] is uh uh too expensive because of
[48:37] inflation and you know the uh um
[48:39] education the price of education has
[48:41] inflated maybe not as much in much of
[48:44] Europe because governments um will uh
[48:47] cap prices and say well you can't charge
[48:49] more than you know certain amount of
[48:51] Euros perom for University education but
[48:54] in the US you know the cost of educ
[48:57] it has
[48:58] skyrocketed um the same with uh the cost
[49:01] of Health Care and other things so and
[49:04] and real estate of course for for people
[49:05] in my generation let's say millennial
[49:07] generation and also now gen gen Z and
[49:11] other generations to come um nobody can
[49:14] think of buying a house uh because the
[49:17] house prices just continually go up due
[49:19] to it being used as a store of value um
[49:23] and massive inflation and nobody can
[49:25] save for it because how are you supposed
[49:27] to save you know in a hard asset uh to
[49:30] buy a house you can the only way of
[49:31] doing that now really is is through
[49:33] buying and and saving Bitcoin um so
[49:36] there's many many different effects I
[49:39] mean even safer deem will talk about
[49:41] things like um the effect on art and
[49:43] culture and music you know that
[49:46] everyone's focused on on the uh lower
[49:49] quality things things that that that can
[49:52] be produced very quickly like let's say
[49:55] I take some paint you know and throw it
[49:57] on on the wall I've created art now and
[50:00] you know can you please buy this for a
[50:02] million dollars you know that's the way
[50:05] people that's that's the way Modern Art
[50:07] is now um but art a 100 years ago or 200
[50:12] years ago it took time to make you know
[50:14] one portrait or one painting took many
[50:18] days of concentration and labor to
[50:20] create the most Exquisite beautiful
[50:23] painting the same thing with a sculpture
[50:25] you know it would take ages is to to
[50:27] Fashion something intricate out of
[50:30] marble and even architecture you know
[50:33] building a cathedral might take a 100
[50:36] years or 200 years uh to make um and it
[50:41] took you know Generations generations of
[50:44] effort generations of wealth going into
[50:46] a single building but but nowadays we
[50:48] don't think about the long term you know
[50:50] if we want to build something it needs
[50:51] to be made of concrete it should be made
[50:54] within you know one year or or two years
[50:57] or five years to build something not 100
[51:00] years you know or 200 years to build
[51:02] something so I think we've also lost a
[51:06] lot of our Drive since 1971 particular I
[51:09] think the world has kind of lost its its
[51:11] Drive lost its focus you know um science
[51:15] Innovation research yeah there are some
[51:17] new discoveries and things you know
[51:19] we've got better iPhones we've got you
[51:21] know internet and things like that but
[51:25] you know we're not really making these
[51:26] bre taking discoveries anymore you know
[51:29] we went to the moon the US went to the
[51:32] moon never went back you know everything
[51:35] has been in a kind of malaise or decline
[51:38] and I think on a hard money you know
[51:40] Bitcoin standard we we'll actually see a
[51:43] new kind of Renaissance of art culture
[51:48] technology um you know low time
[51:50] preference things uh that will lead to
[51:54] new discoveries new Innovations and a
[51:57] better
[51:58] future yeah definitely it's it's it's so
[52:00] exciting the the time that we are able
[52:04] to be alive and to witness all the stuff
[52:06] going on with with Bitcoin and uh with
[52:09] the adoption even internet is coming
[52:11] into play like I talked with the guy
[52:13] Swan about that that it's crazy that we
[52:15] living through uh the internet
[52:17] Revolution and then also with Bitcoin
[52:20] there's an I think an even bigger
[52:22] Revolution going on uh and it's it's
[52:25] it's massive that we we have uh we live
[52:28] through the early days of such an
[52:30] amazing change to society yeah and uh
[52:34] this also brings me to my last question
[52:36] before we get into our end routine um
[52:39] what are you most excited about for
[52:41] Bitcoin in the the coming years like
[52:43] what are you looking forward to to
[52:45] seeing in the the next few years besides
[52:48] price besides uh the things are you any
[52:50] do you have any topics that you right
[52:53] now or in the future really excited
[52:55] about well I'm not not so much on the
[52:57] technical side of things I don't really
[52:59] um you know follow a lot of the
[53:02] technical developments some some
[53:03] technical developments can be good uh
[53:07] some not so much I think we see a lot of
[53:09] stuff with the ordinals now and all that
[53:11] kind of thing which I'm not too excited
[53:13] about uh anything that sort of um takes
[53:16] up the block space that isn't uh sort of
[53:19] a monetary use of Bitcoin um I think
[53:23] bitcoin's primary use case has to be
[53:26] monetary and storing value but I think
[53:30] um I think it will it will become easier
[53:32] to access Bitcoin it'll be easier to um
[53:38] onboard people to bitcoin I think one
[53:40] thing that um uh Fred Krueger and others
[53:44] have pointed out is that it is actually
[53:46] quite difficult to get into Bitcoin for
[53:48] a lot of people um and I found that uh
[53:51] myself with members of my family maybe
[53:53] older members of my family who you know
[53:55] it is it is a challenge to actually set
[53:58] up an account on an exchange and uh go
[54:01] through
[54:02] kyc and buy a hardware wallet and set
[54:05] that up and you know store your seed key
[54:08] and all that kind of stuff is quite
[54:11] difficult um so I I I I don't know what
[54:14] developments there will be in terms of
[54:17] onboarding but I think it will become
[54:20] easier over time to onboard onto Bitcoin
[54:23] either directly uh through uh buy
[54:26] Bitcoin and and and self- custody um uh
[54:31] also through layer
[54:33] 2os um you know lightning Network at the
[54:35] moment lightning Network's great but
[54:37] again it's something that's a bit
[54:39] difficult for most people to wrap their
[54:42] heads around especially older
[54:44] Generations um so if if it can become
[54:47] easier to use the lightning Network and
[54:49] integrate it into more things into more
[54:52] platforms maybe into Twitter X or you
[54:55] know social media um and other sort of
[54:59] layer to solutions that may exist that I
[55:01] don't know about yet or haven't uh been
[55:04] following um you know even the idea of
[55:08] uh you know pegging currencies you know
[55:11] in a way I think um safer deine in his
[55:15] in the Bitcoin standard talks about um
[55:17] Banks getting involved with with Bitcoin
[55:20] and uh you know even pegging things to
[55:23] bitcoin and maybe even um you know more
[55:26] financialization as as you were saying
[55:28] of of Bitcoin itself in terms of things
[55:31] like uh taking loans I know Michael Sor
[55:34] talks about Bitcoin being like real
[55:36] estate in New York um that you would
[55:40] never sell it you know in in Manhattan
[55:42] you you you buy it and then you never
[55:44] sell it but then of course the question
[55:46] is how do you utilize your Bitcoin uh if
[55:49] you never sell it um I mean for some
[55:52] people never sell means never sell until
[55:54] it reaches a certain Point price point
[55:57] but what about lending against or
[55:59] borrowing against Bitcoin so far we've
[56:01] had a lot of problems with that uh as as
[56:04] we've seen with like Celsius and blockfi
[56:07] and these various platforms that have
[56:09] collapsed it it's it's a big risk at the
[56:12] moment to um to borrow against your
[56:15] Bitcoin and you could lose it in the
[56:17] process so making it easier for people
[56:21] to benefit from the Bitcoin they hold
[56:24] without getting involved in some sort of
[56:26] Ponzi or scam or uh you know other
[56:31] blockchain uh that muddies the waters um
[56:35] you know being able to actually say I've
[56:37] got one Bitcoin or two Bitcoin or
[56:39] whatever or 0 five Bitcoin can I take a
[56:42] loan against that can I uh get a
[56:44] mortgage that's backed by Bitcoin for
[56:48] example so I can buy a house without
[56:49] actually selling my Bitcoin so that kind
[56:52] of stuff I think will be very
[56:54] interesting but I'm sure there'll be a
[56:55] lot of interesting developments in in
[56:57] Bitcoin over the next five years 10
[57:00] years that I haven't even anticipated
[57:02] that we may not even be thinking about
[57:04] but there'll be a lot of exciting stuff
[57:06] in the pipeline I think definitely and
[57:08] this is the exciting time uh to be
[57:11] around and now we're coming to the end
[57:13] routine where the previous guest is
[57:15] asking a question for the next guest
[57:17] without knowing who the next guest uh is
[57:20] uh and the question for you is how did
[57:22] Bitcoin change you I think um that's an
[57:25] interesting question for me um I've sort
[57:29] of been following Bitcoin since uh
[57:31] sometime in
[57:33] 2017 um and I've always been kind of
[57:35] interested in um well how systems work
[57:40] and how history sort of leads to various
[57:43] developments and points um and I've also
[57:47] known that there's something wrong with
[57:49] the way things are I've always been sort
[57:50] of concerned with things like you know
[57:53] the the national debt and all that kind
[57:55] of stuff and you know hard money why why
[57:57] is it that money keeps inflating and
[57:59] losing value so for me Bitcoin solved a
[58:04] big problem as in how do we fix these
[58:07] various um systemic issues uh with the
[58:11] financial system with money and also how
[58:15] can I preserve my wealth over time um
[58:18] you know you know if I'm earning money I
[58:20] want to save that money I want to keep
[58:22] it somewhere but you know you know if I
[58:25] look looked at highin bank accounts
[58:28] um there basically aren't any that you
[58:31] know there aren't certainly not uh from
[58:34] around 2020 onwards there's basically no
[58:36] highin bank accounts there's no way of
[58:38] saving money so for me Bitcoin has been
[58:41] a great way of uh saving money storing
[58:45] my wealth and uh being able to actually
[58:48] be optimistic about my own future
[58:52] because I can I can see you know there
[58:54] is hope uh
[58:56] on the horizon you know I can actually
[58:59] not only store my wealth but actually
[59:01] increase my wealth uh without being a
[59:04] genius investor or businessman you know
[59:06] I don't have to you know maybe I would
[59:08] like to have a business one day uh but I
[59:11] don't have to be a genius investor or
[59:13] businessman to increase my wealth over
[59:16] time because Bitcoin is consistently
[59:20] going up over uh going up in value over
[59:22] time so and it's also kind of given me
[59:26] more of that uh low time preference um I
[59:31] it's helped me to be more patient it's
[59:33] helped me to think you know I don't I
[59:35] don't have to have everything now I can
[59:37] um you know uh restrict what I'm
[59:40] spending now in order to save for the
[59:42] future and I'll have a better future
[59:45] than my current uh situation now so it
[59:48] it's made me more optimistic uh more
[59:50] patient and uh it's allowed me to
[59:54] save amazing yeah yeah um that's that's
[59:57] so true and it has so many Ripple
[59:59] effects from that what you just said and
[60:01] that's uh great to see uh that happening
[60:05] um Nicholas thank you for being on it
