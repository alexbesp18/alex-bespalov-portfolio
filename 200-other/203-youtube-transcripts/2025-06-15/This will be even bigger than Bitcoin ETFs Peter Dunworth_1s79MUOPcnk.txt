[00:00] none of us a bullish enough on bitcoin I
[00:01] think it'll surprise everyone with the
[00:03] upside we see somewhere between 500
[00:05] billion and trillion dollar of flows
[00:07] into Bitcoin ETFs I think that's going
[00:09] to be the major story moving forward
[00:11] until the Structured Products get their
[00:13] hands on it it's going to make what the
[00:14] ETFs do look like what the ETFs did to
[00:17] the existing Market Bitcoin is the best
[00:19] performing asset over the last 10 15
[00:21] years yet it is the world's first
[00:23] risk-free asset those three functions of
[00:25] money being store of value me exchange
[00:27] and unit of account the fact is that
[00:29] Bitcoin is the first time in history
[00:31] that you have one asset that is the
[00:33] dominant the apex predator of all of
[00:35] those three functions of money at the
[00:36] same
[00:38] time uh you well known I quickly
[00:41] searched you on YouTube I quickly
[00:42] searched you on on Twitter and you're
[00:44] well known for crazy high price targets
[00:47] for like 7 billion 10 billion uh 10
[00:49] million so I want to definitely get into
[00:52] that how we get to there and how we can
[00:55] achieve those numbers with Bitcoin but
[00:57] first I always try to start the basics
[01:00] because I'm I'm well aware that at every
[01:03] Bitcoin conversation especially now in
[01:05] the bull run where so many new people
[01:06] are coming in uh there's probably one
[01:09] two maybe 10 20 guys in there in the
[01:12] conversation like oh uh but I don't
[01:14] understand Bitcoin so maybe let's get uh
[01:17] first quickly in why is Bitcoin
[01:19] important what is bitcoin doing uh for
[01:21] you personally and what it's doing for
[01:23] society and then let's uh move on to uh
[01:27] how how Bitcoin adoption will grow in
[01:29] the next time so why
[01:32] Bitcoin why Bitcoin um it's a great
[01:35] question and it's easy to get lost on
[01:37] you know why we Bitcoin but um I think
[01:40] like anyone else um the initial response
[01:43] to bitcoin was an opportunity for um a
[01:47] trade an opportunity to make money um an
[01:49] opportunity that would enable you to
[01:52] outperform the other Investments that
[01:53] are available in the market and uh my
[01:56] dayto day is spent looking at you know
[01:58] investment opportunities um all day and
[02:02] um back in 2016 I looked at Bitcoin and
[02:04] it was a highly fragmented um highly
[02:08] speculative asset relative to today's uh
[02:11] today's Bitcoin that we know and um I
[02:14] initially got into Bitcoin as an
[02:16] opportunity to uh improve investment
[02:19] outcomes and I thought look there's a
[02:21] you know put a low waiting um or asset
[02:25] allocation to bitcoin and this could
[02:28] substantially outperform the other
[02:30] investments in the portfolio um I
[02:32] thought back then there was a chance
[02:34] that this could fall over and go to zero
[02:36] so obviously we had that caveat over um
[02:39] the thought that you know this
[02:41] investment could go to zero for clients
[02:43] and we asked all of our clients to sign
[02:45] disclaimers confirming that hey this is
[02:47] a a speculative asset but fast forward 8
[02:50] years and um Bitcoin um has really uh
[02:54] changed my outlook on a whole host of
[02:56] things including um what a good
[03:00] investment opportunity looks like um
[03:02] it's totally redefined my way of
[03:03] thinking about risk um although Bitcoin
[03:06] is
[03:08] uh a highly volatile asset I believe it
[03:12] is the risk-free asset of the world and
[03:13] this is where over the next 10 years as
[03:15] we see corporate and institutional
[03:17] adoption of Bitcoin the rest of the
[03:19] world will come to see that this is the
[03:21] risk-free opportunity uh this is the
[03:24] risk-free asset of the world but um in
[03:27] starting with a financial outcome that I
[03:29] wanted to achieve aeve in getting into
[03:31] Bitcoin I guess you know the primary
[03:32] driver of that is fundamentally greed um
[03:35] and then you go down the rabbit hole you
[03:37] spend time here and realize that Bitcoin
[03:39] really does solve so many other problems
[03:41] um that we have in society and there
[03:43] have been you know absolute stor warts
[03:45] of the industry who have written
[03:47] extensively on this and you know I think
[03:49] of uh safine with his fat standard um
[03:52] and Bitcoin standard I think of Jeff boo
[03:55] with his price of tomorrow I think of
[03:57] canut and his work and books that he's
[03:59] done um you know three great authors in
[04:02] that capacity that have have really
[04:04] helped shape a whole host of opinion on
[04:06] bitcoin and and move the needle forward
[04:09] um and and this is where you
[04:11] know you come for the number go up you
[04:14] stay for the revolution I think is the
[04:16] too long didn't read of of
[04:19] Bitcoin yeah definitely and it's also
[04:21] like um because people are like oh how
[04:24] can Bitcoin fix this how can Bitcoin fix
[04:26] this it's so easy because uh everything
[04:28] we're doing has some transactions to it
[04:31] some Financial uh or some live energy
[04:34] transaction to it and this is called
[04:36] money in the end of the day and Bitcoin
[04:38] fixes money and so it it with with
[04:41] fixing money it fixes so many issues
[04:44] coming with that um and still a lot of
[04:47] people I think uh misunderstand Bitcoin
[04:49] for some oh in the west probably it's
[04:52] say it's a luxury uh item it's it's
[04:55] something that only rich people doing uh
[04:58] then what are we like what do you think
[05:00] is like the most common misconceptions
[05:02] or why is Bitcoin sometimes so
[05:05] misunderstood um is it the volatility
[05:08] what do you think is is like the best
[05:10] the greatest hurdle now for like
[05:12] understanding Bitcoin in the in the
[05:13] mainstream Robin that is a very good
[05:15] question and I haven't uh been asked
[05:18] that before I think if I would to think
[05:21] about this I think the number one reason
[05:23] why there is a misunderstanding of
[05:26] Bitcoin is because it breaks so many
[05:28] norms it is a paradox if you think about
[05:31] this on many levels uh Bitcoin is you
[05:35] know the best performing asset over the
[05:37] last 10 15 years yet it is the world's
[05:40] first risk-free asset yeah that in
[05:43] itself is a paradox then you think about
[05:45] the fact that it's you know wildly
[05:48] volatile but risk-free and it's like
[05:51] this doesn't make sense and then you go
[05:53] through and think about a whole host of
[05:54] other things and and you I guess
[05:57] preconceptions that Bitcoin breaks in
[05:59] the fact that you know for the first
[06:01] time ever we have the ability to solve
[06:03] the bantine generals problem um we have
[06:05] the first time you know it's the first I
[06:09] guess Discovery or invention of you know
[06:12] digital scarcity you know digital
[06:14] scarcity was an oxymoron up until
[06:16] Bitcoin was invented because there was
[06:18] you know there was no such thing as
[06:20] digital scarcity until the bantine
[06:23] general problem was solved and the
[06:25] ability to to create digital scarcity
[06:28] and this is where there are so many of
[06:31] these paradoxes in Bitcoin that it is
[06:34] really difficult to comprehend and
[06:37] unless you study it acutely and spend a
[06:41] lot of time looking at it these
[06:44] paradoxes um most people just throw out
[06:46] without understanding and it becomes too
[06:49] hard there are too many
[06:52] uh there are too many facets to bitcoin
[06:55] that you really need to master or
[06:57] understand in order to get a more
[06:59] complete knowledge or understanding of
[07:01] Bitcoin and you know I look at some of
[07:03] the things that you know you need to
[07:05] understand from you know off the top of
[07:07] my head you need to have an
[07:08] understanding of sound you know economic
[07:10] policies you need to understand Finance
[07:13] you need to have a some form of
[07:15] understanding of computer science um you
[07:18] know distributed networks um and you
[07:21] know that's just to name but a few and
[07:24] you know who on Earth has that variety
[07:26] of skill set and who on Earth is
[07:28] interested five different things to put
[07:30] all of this together to say oh my
[07:33] goodness this is the answer to my
[07:34] problems and you know those five
[07:36] different things can solve every problem
[07:39] on Earth yeah
[07:41] it's it's FAL it's fanciful to think
[07:43] that that can actually happen but this
[07:46] is where going down that Bitcoin rabbit
[07:48] hole is probably one of the most
[07:49] rewarding intellectual Journeys that
[07:51] I've had um and I've spent far more time
[07:53] studying Bitcoin than I did for a degree
[07:55] or finance and now my day-to-day is
[07:57] spent um spent on bitcoin and it's an
[08:00] absolute Delight because it's it's a
[08:03] never- ending Rabbit
[08:04] Hole yeah it's it's always fascinating
[08:07] for me that it opens up another another
[08:09] Rabbit Hole another rabbit hole and it's
[08:11] like I'm studying now for for yeah now
[08:15] it's four years that I'm in Bitcoin uh
[08:17] really so it's always every year there's
[08:19] something new coming up there's some new
[08:21] rabbit hole there's something new to it
[08:23] a new book that's some new aspect to it
[08:25] it's it's fascinating and this is also
[08:27] like the the topic of today um because
[08:30] we have this uh crazy technology that
[08:33] runs up in price crashes down in price
[08:35] runs up in price crashes down in price
[08:38] and the base is always getting bigger
[08:40] and bigger the highs is also getting
[08:42] always bigger and bigger and when normal
[08:45] people that are not done the research
[08:47] see this and like what is this and then
[08:50] there are people coming out and saying
[08:52] it's go to 1 million then there are
[08:54] people coming out this goes to 10
[08:55] million then you are coming out it goes
[08:57] to7 billion dollars uh so I think uh
[09:00] people that didn't do the research work
[09:03] just will call you crazy I guess I don't
[09:05] know how was your experience with that
[09:08] uh I'm really interested in in then um
[09:11] how do you come from that number we are
[09:14] now like 70 2,000 Euros maybe we will
[09:18] release this podcast in two three weeks
[09:20] so probably maybe we are already at
[09:22] 100,000 let's see uh where we are in two
[09:25] three weeks um how do we come from that
[09:28] number and now like a million to 10
[09:30] million to uh even more than that to
[09:33] like billions because even from 1
[09:35] million to 1 billion this is like a huge
[09:38] step in in in
[09:40] valuations how do you how do you imagine
[09:43] we are coming to those
[09:46] numbers there's there's a there's a
[09:48] really short answer to this and I can
[09:50] give you an extended one the the too
[09:52] long didn't read of this is that the
[09:55] world has a collateral problem at this
[09:57] point in time and Bitcoin is the best
[09:59] form of collateral ever invented my
[10:02] expectation is um not only is it the
[10:05] best form of collateral it is the best
[10:07] form of money ever invented and we have
[10:10] those three functions of money being
[10:11] store of value me of exchange and unit
[10:13] of account the the fact is that Bitcoin
[10:17] is the first time in history that you
[10:19] have one asset that is the the dominant
[10:22] the apex predator of all of those three
[10:25] functions of money at the same time with
[10:27] the ability to be collap natural now all
[10:31] of a sudden that completely redefines
[10:33] the space as far as how much wealth can
[10:35] be absorbed by Bitcoin and this is where
[10:38] probably a better way of thinking about
[10:39] it is you know what our friend Jeff Bo
[10:41] talks about where he says it's
[10:43] impossible to Value the the future
[10:46] system from within the existing one and
[10:50] this is where what I try to do is put a
[10:52] valuation framework around Bitcoin um to
[10:55] highlight how absurd it's going to get
[10:57] very quickly and the thinking and the r
[10:59] now um on say a $7 billion Bitcoin is
[11:03] quite simply once people understand what
[11:06] this is and we have the bulk of it tied
[11:08] up in collateral and we don't have the
[11:12] um need to sell it because we've got a
[11:15] functioning credit Market on top of
[11:17] Bitcoin then Bitcoin will facilitate the
[11:22] entire global trade because it's the
[11:23] best form of money ever invented now I
[11:26] don't think it's important to do that in
[11:27] order for it to go or 100x up from here
[11:30] but if it's facilitating daily global
[11:33] trade we have $6.3 trillion of daily
[11:36] global trade and we only have 900
[11:39] Bitcoin minted on the day that gives us
[11:41] a $7 billion Bitcoin if you divide 6.3
[11:44] trillion by whatever is minted on the
[11:46] day which is going to have to facilitate
[11:48] whatever the daily global trade is then
[11:51] we get to a ridiculous number of $7
[11:53] billion and then this is where the
[11:55] numbers get exponential very quickly is
[11:58] that you know
[12:00] that that is assuming that there's a
[12:01] static GDP number so assuming no human
[12:04] growth moving forward and then in
[12:07] addition to that you have a Haring
[12:08] period every four years where we're just
[12:10] about to go into one in you know on the
[12:12] 20th of April where 900 Bitcoins minted
[12:15] per day are going to drop to
[12:17] 450 and all of a sudden it's not going
[12:20] to be a $7 billion Bitcoin it's going to
[12:22] be a 14 billion doll Bitcoin you know by
[12:25] a fair market value assumption of of
[12:27] what I've laid out and you know don't
[12:29] get caught up in the number no one cares
[12:31] about the number but get caught up in
[12:33] the thinking about well if what I'm
[12:34] telling you is correct when it comes to
[12:37] you know why it's the best asset why
[12:39] it's the best form of money why it's the
[12:41] best form of collateral it only makes
[12:43] sense in a logical progression to think
[12:45] that these things will play out now what
[12:47] I don't know is how long it's going to
[12:49] take to play out but I'm pretty certain
[12:52] as long as Bitcoin keeps functioning
[12:54] then that trajectory is certain it's
[12:57] just a matter of when it's going to
[12:58] approach those numbers
[13:00] and this assumption also kind of um it's
[13:04] crazy for me to think about because when
[13:06] we come to those numbers I don't know if
[13:08] we value Bitcoin even in US Dollars
[13:10] anymore like uh it's it's like from here
[13:13] and out we are thinking about that but
[13:15] you're also saying Bitcoin is standard
[13:17] based layer and we're having a
[13:18] functioning credit system on top of that
[13:21] uh so you're saying that something like
[13:23] a US dollar can be on top of Bitcoin
[13:27] like on the gold standard or how do you
[13:30] think this will work out okay yeah do I
[13:33] think it will so and that's the ability
[13:36] to basically print Bitcoin to
[13:39] Infinity because the second you remove
[13:41] that then you're Capa to whatever human
[13:44] human growth is or GDP
[13:47] is so we will uh have like Bitcoin as a
[13:51] base layer just as like with the gold
[13:53] standard and then uh us us governments
[13:56] or central banks uh will buy Bitcoin as
[13:59] a base layer and a mint use dollars or
[14:03] whatever they will call it on top of of
[14:05] Bitcoin like as a layer two fre four to
[14:08] bitcoin this is like what how do you
[14:09] think about that yeah that's exactly
[14:12] what I think will happen and this is
[14:14] where for the first time in history
[14:17] you're going to have the ability to and
[14:19] and this you know where we gear our
[14:21] clients up for thinking about this in in
[14:24] the longer term
[14:26] um to avoid having to sell Bitcoin you
[14:29] need a functioning credit Market on
[14:31] bitcoin um and so how would that work
[14:34] well you know if you have a functioning
[14:36] credit Market on bitcoin that serves two
[14:38] two purposes firstly it allows you to
[14:41] never sell your Bitcoin so you're not
[14:43] going to be incurring any taxes from a
[14:45] capital gains tax perspective with your
[14:47] government or relative
[14:49] jurisdiction and secondly uh and most
[14:52] importantly it's going to ensure that no
[14:53] Bitcoin comes to market for sale so it's
[14:56] going to further increase the pressure
[14:59] um on on the price Rising because
[15:01] there's no Supply so it's of critical
[15:05] importance that those things come to
[15:06] Market if we're interested in numberg go
[15:08] up technology because that's going to be
[15:10] one of the forcing functions to ensure
[15:14] that Supply doesn't come back to
[15:16] Market yeah that's uh that's uh also
[15:19] like how I think about it I'm not sure
[15:21] how Layer Two and US Dollars on top of
[15:25] Bitcoin will work um but I'm 100%
[15:27] certain that Bitcoin will be like the
[15:29] base layer and everything on top will
[15:31] compete with each other and we will see
[15:33] how how this will play out I'm curious
[15:36] now how do you see the uh adoption going
[15:40] for that um how how is the The Next Step
[15:43] because um we had like 2020 uh 2020 the
[15:48] first publicly traded company with micro
[15:50] strategy coming in now it's like 607 60
[15:53] 70 80 companies that do that there will
[15:56] be a lot more companies now coming in
[15:58] also with the Bitcoin ETF uh then we
[16:01] have 2021 with El salvad the first
[16:04] country that kind of adopted a Bitcoin
[16:06] standard of course they're not fully
[16:07] only on bitcoin they also have US dollar
[16:10] but they are far ahead in the in the
[16:12] story then we have this year the Bitcoin
[16:14] EF what do you imagine in the next like
[16:17] 10 years happening adoption wise without
[16:20] the price just like what what Milestones
[16:22] do you think we hit or do we have to hit
[16:25] to like progress in that adoption uh to
[16:29] to hit those crazy
[16:31] numbers I think we're a lot closer than
[16:34] people
[16:35] think and I think there I had a
[16:39] conversation with a friend earlier this
[16:40] week and he'll know who it is but if you
[16:44] think about the the fact now that
[16:46] institutions are here and they have the
[16:48] ability to hold it purchase it by an ETF
[16:51] um you know that's a safe structure um I
[16:54] look at the financial Carnage that was
[16:58] created during the GFC by standardizing
[17:02] and packaging up residential back
[17:04] mortgage Securities in the
[17:06] US was the biggest um Financial collapse
[17:10] that we'd seen and that was because they
[17:13] securitized all of the lending in the US
[17:16] it was a structured product type thing
[17:19] now if you look at Structured Products
[17:23] Bitcoin is the ideal product to put in a
[17:27] structured product if you're a
[17:29] structured product guy and if anyone's
[17:30] listening out there then I urge you to
[17:33] think about doing this because you
[17:35] know a product I was talking about
[17:37] earlier today that would
[17:39] leave suades of institutional money just
[17:43] running for this type of product was
[17:46] talking about how you could have a
[17:50] principal protected note in a structured
[17:52] product so it's an Institutional product
[17:54] um but can you imagine being able to
[17:56] have a capital
[17:57] guaranteed note for say 500 million or
[18:01] call it 10 billion in round
[18:03] numbers you can go out and buy 5year
[18:05] treasuries at roughly four or 5% to
[18:08] Capital guarantee that so you use 80% of
[18:11] the $10 billion to go and buy you know
[18:13] government US government
[18:15] treasuries that is your principal
[18:18] protected part of the structured product
[18:21] but the important thing is with the
[18:22] remaining 20% that you haven't invested
[18:25] you can then go and buy Bitcoin to juice
[18:27] up the returns of this product so you're
[18:30] going to get you're going to sell a two
[18:31] bill10 billion note and or structured
[18:34] product and you're going to have 2
[18:35] billion going straight into buying
[18:38] Bitcoin now during the GFC these guys
[18:42] sold tens of trillions of dollars of
[18:45] this stuff pre GFC now it's still a
[18:49] multi- trillion dollar market but what
[18:51] happens when that type of capital starts
[18:54] flowing into Bitcoin now you know
[18:56] everyone's excited about the ETFs and oh
[18:59] $500 million a day that's amazing for
[19:02] these guys who do this you know product
[19:05] structuring yeah they could do $20
[19:07] billion a week with their eyes shut it
[19:11] wouldn't even touch the sides those
[19:12] things that product would run out the
[19:14] door like everyone want it because you
[19:17] know by my calculations on a 50% GGA
[19:20] that would juce the returns of this
[19:22] structured note like a can you imagine a
[19:24] principal protected note that could give
[19:26] you a 18% return perom
[19:30] risk-free that's based on my CS with the
[19:33] you know 50% gager of 20% of that node
[19:36] in Bitcoin and 80% in the you know the
[19:39] risk-free principle
[19:40] protected um US Treasury now the only
[19:43] assumption I'm making there is that the
[19:45] US government's going to pay its debt
[19:47] say all of a sudden this totally
[19:48] redefines the demand metrics of what
[19:51] we're seeing with the ETFs this puts
[19:54] basically on steroids you know if the
[19:56] ETFs are doing 500 million to billion a
[20:00] day these guys could be doing $10
[20:02] billion a day with their eyes
[20:06] shut and this is just one product stream
[20:10] not multiple this is just one so um and
[20:13] I know there is a huge need
[20:15] for you know this type of thing out
[20:17] there because we've got a collateral
[20:19] problem globally and we don't have the
[20:21] ability to earn and there's multiple
[20:24] other problems with it and you know this
[20:26] is you know one of the solutions to
[20:28] basically create equity in the market
[20:30] now what that would do is that would
[20:32] drive the price of Bitcoin through the
[20:33] roof and up exponentially but it
[20:36] wouldn't be at the cost of the bond
[20:38] market it wouldn't be at the cost of the
[20:39] stock market it wouldn't be at the cost
[20:41] of the property market so you're going
[20:43] to cause the least damage by rewarding a
[20:45] very small minority of the community by
[20:48] bitcoiners to solve all of your
[20:50] financial wow and you know the debt to
[20:52] GDP ratio that you problem that you've
[20:54] got now do you have a like of course
[20:57] timing is always so hard to predict uh
[20:59] but you have a rough timeline where like
[21:02] this will happen in within the next 5
[21:05] years or do you see this probably even
[21:07] like happen really soon because you said
[21:09] in the early like this uh you see it
[21:12] happening way sooner than most think to
[21:14] have some imagination when this could
[21:18] happen uh
[21:21] I I think there's the opportunity for
[21:23] this to happen in the next 5
[21:26] years and if that's the case if that
[21:29] happens in the next 5 years we'll see
[21:31] you know $10 million a coin in the next
[21:33] 5 years if that type of product gets any
[21:36] traction this could also then break this
[21:39] foure cycle thing uh if if this is
[21:41] actually like uh bringing so much in
[21:44] then I think Michael saor talked about
[21:46] that uh your your models will be
[21:48] destroyed once the big guys come in
[21:50] something like that uh do you think
[21:54] justak Y at some point in time in in
[21:58] some point in time we we we break the
[22:00] model to the upside when enough people
[22:02] figure out what Michael sailor is doing
[22:04] all this structured product and they can
[22:06] print and then ju the returns of those
[22:08] bonds um and the only thing we have to
[22:11] rely on is for Wall Street to be
[22:14] greedy now I look at that and think
[22:17] that's a really safe bet you know that's
[22:20] like a duct to water you know that's
[22:23] like that's one of the easiest bets we
[22:25] could make you know and Bitcoin ERS can
[22:28] get behind supporting them being as
[22:30] greedy as they want because it's going
[22:32] to lift all our boates it's going to be
[22:34] a rising tide for every Bitcoin right
[22:37] there 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from
[22:40] day one and they teach and preach self
[22:43] custody this is my go to exchange when
[22:46] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[22:48] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[22:51] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[22:54] fees Plus at the same time support this
[22:57] podcast use code Robin and click the
[22:59] link in the
[23:01] description I'm I'm I'm asking myself a
[23:04] lot what the implications of that will
[23:06] be because we're now uh when we see all
[23:09] this stuff happening in the future uh we
[23:12] now still so early and it's now still
[23:14] such a bargain to get into Bitcoin um
[23:17] what do you think will happen uh let's
[23:20] firstly go AB broad like what do you
[23:22] think will happen with the economy what
[23:24] do you think will happen with with
[23:26] governments with with uh with all the
[23:29] structure that we have now do you think
[23:30] Bitcoin will um bring a big change uh in
[23:35] that enormous change absolutely I think
[23:38] you look at you
[23:40] know I look at this from a personal
[23:43] level and I just extrapolate out what
[23:45] that means for the rest of society but I
[23:47] can tell you Bitcoin has B enormous
[23:49] change to me person personally in many
[23:51] ways um obviously from a Financial
[23:54] Freedom perspective from a you know um
[23:57] from a risk management perspective um
[23:59] how we look at Investments how we
[24:02] allocate um there is just a whole host
[24:04] of changes that it's bought as well as
[24:06] an outlook on on on the future it's made
[24:10] me very optimistic on the future because
[24:13] for the first time we have
[24:17] um we have genuine hope that is
[24:19] ubiquitous across the world that anyone
[24:21] can access and this is the opportunity
[24:25] for the human race to access that level
[24:28] of Hope opportunity for everyone on
[24:30] Earth and this is something that has
[24:32] never been achieved before and this is
[24:35] the great hope that I have that Bitcoin
[24:38] has the ability to help people move up
[24:40] that maslo needs hierarchy drag people
[24:42] out of Po poverty help people put food
[24:45] on the table and then with that they can
[24:47] start developing longer term outlooks
[24:49] and when we have 8 billion people on
[24:51] Earth self-actualizing you know what is
[24:54] the human race capable of when we are
[24:56] all you know on that level and um
[25:00] Bitcoin is the first instrument tool
[25:03] whatever you want to call it that has
[25:05] the ability to unite and unify you know
[25:09] uh 8 billion people's uh incentives so
[25:12] for that and I'm very hopeful and this
[25:15] is what you know brings me such hope for
[25:17] for the future of humanity is that we
[25:19] have this tool that we can all have
[25:21] common ground on and because it's so
[25:24] important within society and that it's
[25:26] it's a a mechanism of exchange or you
[25:28] know communication I.E exchanging and
[25:31] communicating value um this is intrinsic
[25:34] to every human every human on earth so
[25:37] we are all going to place huge
[25:39] importance to this um in our lives and
[25:41] it's going to give us the ability to
[25:43] have a middle ground for you know for
[25:46] every human on it so that's a little
[25:49] deep but I think it offers the
[25:51] opportunity to do that in the future
[25:52] that nothing else has uh nothing else
[25:55] comes close on that that's interesting
[25:57] because um we have uh when we see all
[26:01] the people rising with poverty and then
[26:03] we see um the Mind changes that also
[26:06] happen when people adopt Bitcoin and
[26:08] have this low time preference money um
[26:12] I'm also wondering uh What uh could
[26:15] happen to to governments because then
[26:17] they have less or no capabilities of of
[26:22] print money you said in the beginning
[26:24] that you imagine a credit system on top
[26:26] of of Bitcoin uh but obviously uh with
[26:29] with a sound man money as a standard
[26:32] with with a base layer uh it it will
[26:35] limit their capabilities I guess uh so
[26:38] do you do you see like governments um
[26:42] going in a different direction becoming
[26:44] more service orientated towards the
[26:46] citizens and less
[26:48] um less regime like it's my sincere hope
[26:52] that they do because it'll be in their
[26:54] best interest and most importantly we
[26:56] forget that governments amen serve the
[26:58] people so it would actually be a huge
[27:01] Improvement on the service offering that
[27:03] they're currently making by adopting a
[27:06] Bitcoin standard and this is the ironic
[27:09] thing is that by adopting a Bitcoin
[27:11] standard they would actually be able to
[27:13] deliver better Services quicker faster
[27:16] cheaper than if they ignore it and this
[27:19] is going to be a sort of a sticking
[27:21] point I think for a lot of governments
[27:23] moving forward that they're going to be
[27:25] very threatened by Bitcoin because it
[27:27] has you know the ability to expose you
[27:31] know a lot of things that aren't really
[27:33] common knowledge in society such as
[27:35] inflation and debasement of currencies
[27:38] um money Printing and theft um but for
[27:41] those countries that adopt it we're
[27:42] going to see a stark contrast to the
[27:45] countries that shun it and this is where
[27:48] um for your sake and my sake I hope our
[27:50] governments are quick to adopt it
[27:52] because those who adopt it first will
[27:54] benefit from
[27:56] it yeah and I think
[27:59] uh there's a saying that uh you cannot
[28:02] ban Bitcoin but you can only ban
[28:04] yourself from Bitcoin and I think this
[28:05] is what will happen there will be
[28:07] governments and uh countries that will
[28:09] try to get Bitcoin out of of the systems
[28:13] uh and they will fail I mean we have the
[28:15] best example with China they trying to
[28:17] get rid of Bitcoin since a since a long
[28:19] time uh uh from from the mining
[28:21] perspective they obviously failed till
[28:23] now uh but then you have countries like
[28:26] El Salvador where the president is top
[28:28] down really bullish on on bitcoin then
[28:31] we have Nigeria which has an amazing
[28:34] adoption crass adoption from bottom up
[28:37] uh and I think people will just um first
[28:40] of all try to to make it happen somehow
[28:44] um to get the Bitcoin standard in their
[28:46] own country and if this is not happening
[28:49] then they can uh still move somewhere
[28:52] where it's impossible and if you ban
[28:54] Bitcoin the only thing you're doing is
[28:56] basically getting the bit can Capital
[28:58] out of the country to some other country
[29:01] and then is where the game theory uh
[29:03] starts coming in I guess this is how it
[29:06] how it will play
[29:07] out I agree wholeheartedly with that
[29:10] it's going to be fun to
[29:11] watch definitely this is kind of also
[29:14] the the reason that I did the podcast
[29:15] but was I feel like when you see the the
[29:17] internet adoption in like 1995 and you
[29:20] have an podcast which is like daily
[29:22] interviewing people on the topic of
[29:24] Internet would be fun to watch how how
[29:26] this all plays out with Amon and
[29:28] everything so I just want to document
[29:31] everything and interview all the
[29:32] bitcoiners on the podcast and and
[29:34] especially it will be interesting how
[29:36] these bitcoiners that are now so big in
[29:40] Bitcoin um will um go on in the future
[29:44] do you see like when when because now we
[29:47] have bitcoiners who can afford um um an
[29:51] whole Bitcoin this will be something
[29:53] really rare in like 10 20 years people
[29:55] that afford maybe even 10 Bitcoin if you
[29:58] got in early maybe they even have 100
[30:00] Bitcoins um this will be such an huge
[30:03] amount of money um do you think uh like
[30:08] uh this this has any implications uh of
[30:11] course this has implications for them
[30:13] but do you imagine anything um going on
[30:17] with with bitcoiners that are really
[30:18] early on do you have to have special
[30:22] protection what do you what do you see
[30:25] on on that anything going on
[30:28] no I don't think I don't think um
[30:30] Bitcoin is are going to need special
[30:33] protection I don't think they're going
[30:34] to
[30:35] need um anything in that regard and I
[30:38] don't think it's going to be on
[30:40] ostentatious consumption because you
[30:43] know most bitcoiners end up becoming
[30:46] absolutely infatuated with Bitcoin to
[30:48] the point where you know most bitcoiners
[30:51] I know have you know a name for each of
[30:53] their Bitcoins you know that sort of
[30:56] love for an asset like nothing else I've
[30:58] seen and I say that factiously but this
[31:00] is where um in a Fiat world you are
[31:04] encouraged to consume and there is um
[31:08] all sorts of outrageous consumption
[31:10] whether it be extravagant boats you know
[31:14] million doll bottles of wine you name it
[31:17] there's a an extravagance to it that is
[31:20] celebrated in Fiat culture as a way of
[31:23] you know hey I've made it um but in
[31:26] Bitcoin no one is in incentivized to
[31:28] spend like that and I don't see any
[31:32] bitcoiners who are you know going to
[31:34] carry on like that um in perpetuity you
[31:37] know thrilled with how rich they are so
[31:39] they go and spend you know money on you
[31:43] know totally ostentatious things that
[31:46] you know don't
[31:48] require uh or don't improve or have any
[31:50] real utility and this is where I think
[31:53] Bitcoin is going to usher in an age of
[31:55] conserv financial conservativism
[31:58] where people are incentivized to save
[32:00] and most Bitcoin as I know are you know
[32:03] Ultra conservative when it comes to
[32:05] spending you know they really value
[32:06] their Bitcoin and in order to sell it
[32:09] and and spend it there's got to be some
[32:12] you know something really important that
[32:14] they want or really meaningful that's
[32:16] going to change their themselves
[32:19] personally so I think the ability to
[32:22] store wealth in Bitcoin is going to be
[32:24] critical and the fact that you can store
[32:26] wealth in Bitcoin and it's going to go
[32:28] up faster than anything else is going to
[32:30] incentivize those people who are holding
[32:32] a lot of it not to spend a lot of it and
[32:35] this is
[32:37] where I think from my experience with
[32:40] money is the only reason not the only
[32:43] reason but you know one of the major
[32:45] causes of um people being jealous of
[32:48] other people's financial position is
[32:51] when people rub it in in their noses
[32:54] through outrageous
[32:56] spending you know
[32:58] call it belligerent you know excess um
[33:02] you know that is when people look at
[33:04] that and think hey that's really shitty
[33:06] I'm struggling but you get to go and
[33:08] Flash everything around with you the
[33:10] Bitcoin as I know there's just a a a
[33:14] very deep-seated conservatism with not
[33:17] wanting to be that person and this is
[33:20] where in addition to that every bit
[33:23] Corner I've met has wanted to help their
[33:26] friends their family their communities
[33:29] uplift them and improve their situation
[33:31] and this is where rather than the
[33:34] spending side of things on you know this
[33:37] the stupid consumption Bitcoin and the
[33:40] wealth that it brings enables all
[33:42] bitcoiners to change the financial
[33:44] outcomes and trajectory of their close
[33:48] community and this is where rather than
[33:51] having concern about being a wealthy
[33:52] bitcoiner there's going to be the
[33:54] opportunity for bitcoiners to
[33:56] dramatically improve their communities
[33:58] and the outcomes that they're achieving
[34:00] and help uplift everyone so I I I'll
[34:03] take the flip side of that and bet on
[34:08] Humanity uh that's a it's a very
[34:11] beautiful way to to think about it I
[34:13] think and also I fully agree with that
[34:16] because I see when when when I talk with
[34:19] bitcoiners and you ative guest on the
[34:22] podcast I talked with other bitcoiners
[34:24] offline uh they are all really
[34:28] um they in there so early because they
[34:32] have a mission to to better something
[34:34] they they want to do something uh good
[34:36] and they they all come in as you said in
[34:39] the beginning for for n technology but
[34:42] they somehow uh stay for this Revolution
[34:45] and uh those uh people that are greedy
[34:47] those people that are uh focused on
[34:50] money they leave they come in and they
[34:53] leave again and then they are going in
[34:55] this altcoin casino the shitcoin casino
[34:58] uh and this is I think a good good way
[35:00] to think about because the true
[35:01] bitcoiners that are Bitcoin only um they
[35:04] they are here for for something great
[35:06] and this is this is amazing then when we
[35:09] have now uh bitcoiners are getting
[35:12] wealth we having a lot of stacks but
[35:14] also uh being there for the community I
[35:17] think it's important uh that we take our
[35:20] Bitcoin seriously because if we lose
[35:22] them or we get hacked or whatever
[35:24] happens with our Bitcoin uh then we end
[35:27] up in a situation where we cannot help
[35:29] like if you don't have Bitcoin uh it's
[35:32] it's like even if you accumulate a lot
[35:35] of Bitcoin what helps when when you lose
[35:37] it again uh and there there are so many
[35:40] stories out there I I I also recently
[35:43] interviewed Rick uh who lost 25 Bitcoin
[35:47] uh I interviewed uh people that uh lost
[35:50] Bitcoin and then even people said like
[35:52] you're not a real bitcoiner if you
[35:54] didn't lose most of your
[35:56] Bitcoin
[36:27] [Music]
[36:58] uh personally and and this is where um
[37:02] anyone who's down the rabbit hole in
[37:03] Bitcoin and trying to self- custody I I
[37:06] don't um want to push my opinions on
[37:10] them because I understand that in
[37:12] Bitcoin and particularly self- Cassy
[37:14] there's no Solutions but only tradeoffs
[37:17] and I I can talk to what we do at the
[37:19] Bitcoin advisor which um has a perfect
[37:23] track record of not losing a single
[37:25] betcoin but we leverage off uh we
[37:28] leverage off um expertise from a number
[37:31] of professionals um and this is how we
[37:34] can deliver a service to clients that
[37:36] ensures that even if they have never
[37:39] they wouldn't even know what a hardware
[37:40] wallet is we can get them self- custody
[37:43] and a collaborative custody environment
[37:46] and we can ensure that they're not going
[37:47] to lose their coins they're not going to
[37:49] get rugged they're not going to suffer
[37:51] from a fishing attack they're not going
[37:53] to have uh you know friends over who
[37:56] find 24 Le words um walk out the door
[37:59] and then empty their wallets and this is
[38:03] where I think for me the collaborative
[38:05] custody setup is an ideal way of storing
[38:09] large amounts of Bitcoin because you
[38:11] have no single point of failure in your
[38:13] setup and so the very unique thing about
[38:16] the Bitcoin advisor that we've managed
[38:19] to do is we've managed to leverage um
[38:23] multi- Solutions across the market and
[38:27] remove the single point of failure so if
[38:30] we think that Bitcoin is going to
[38:31] billions of dollars per coin um and it's
[38:34] going to happen a lot quicker than we
[38:35] think then I'm certain that people are
[38:38] going to think very differently about
[38:39] their self- custody and they're going to
[38:42] spend a lot more time on it it's going
[38:44] to take up a lot more head space and
[38:46] this is something that you know I've
[38:48] spent the last eight years delivering to
[38:50] clients um across the globe that
[38:56] by doing this collaborative custody
[38:59] setup and custody for clients we've been
[39:03] able to go through three probates now
[39:05] where sadly clients have passed but
[39:09] despite the fact that they were self-
[39:10] cing their Bitcoin um we were able to
[39:12] safely transfer that Bitcoin to their
[39:14] families and this is a track record that
[39:17] I'm exceptionally proud of that we um
[39:19] have been able to support all of our
[39:21] clients in that capacity and removed
[39:24] every single point of failure so um
[39:27] that's probably the ultimate and this is
[39:29] where we have a stack of resources on
[39:31] our website if uh anyone's curious about
[39:34] doing it themselves then there's a
[39:36] protocol up there that you can um
[39:39] leverage off of our understanding and
[39:41] what we've done in the last uh eight
[39:43] years and um if there's any um anything
[39:47] that's unclear there um we've got a host
[39:49] of resources on the website that we want
[39:51] to make sure that if anyone's in Bitcoin
[39:53] now we want to make sure that not only
[39:55] are they um obviously stacking more coin
[39:58] but we want to make sure that they're
[39:59] not going to blow that opportunity in
[40:02] the event of an untimely death or
[40:04] alternatively um a misunderstanding of
[40:06] the technology behind it and how to
[40:08] safely self- custody so um we make all
[40:11] of those resources available for free
[40:13] that anyone can go in and have a look
[40:16] and hopefully have some ideas on how to
[40:18] improve their own self- custody um with
[40:20] that and um if if they ever want to talk
[40:23] to us where there's a stack of advisers
[40:25] there who know exactly how this protocol
[40:28] works and um we'd love to help if if you
[40:31] don't want to do it
[40:32] yourself and I think this helps a lot
[40:35] like uh obviously you can find all the
[40:39] information yourself uh but even if you
[40:41] have your information by yourself even
[40:43] if you have um your a good self- custody
[40:47] setup uh it even helps to just talk with
[40:50] an expert with an external source and uh
[40:53] who does not know your personal
[40:55] situation like you can tell them
[40:57] uh this is my setup uh do you think
[41:00] there are any improvements do you think
[41:01] there are any weak points like even to
[41:03] just check up on your selfcast
[41:04] resolution that uh I I highly recommend
[41:08] people taking their self custody serious
[41:10] whatever they doing there are so many
[41:12] services so many uh Solutions out there
[41:14] and so many materials on that but my
[41:17] most important thing is I always take it
[41:20] seriously and do it before you get
[41:22] extremely
[41:24] rich might be might be too late
[41:26] afterwards
[41:30] so and maybe uh to to end the podcast
[41:33] off before we get into our end routine
[41:36] uh what do you see as an Outlook
[41:38] happening this year do you see anything
[41:41] uh crazy happening this year do you have
[41:42] a price prediction for the end of the
[41:44] year do you have any outlooks for
[41:46] Bitcoin in 2024 going to have um I think
[41:50] we're going to have continued
[41:52] um strong demand from the institutional
[41:55] side of things I think that demand is
[41:58] only going to continue to grow if I
[42:00] think about the journey that I've been
[42:03] on for the last8 years with my clients I
[42:06] can tell you that the numbers that
[42:07] everyone's putting forward are Ultra
[42:10] conservative you know I think last time
[42:13] I checked you know no one believed that
[42:15] there'd be $60 billion of flows this
[42:17] year into you know into uh the Bitcoin
[42:21] ETFs I wouldn't be surprised in the next
[42:23] 2 years if we see somewhere between 500
[42:26] billion and a billion 500 billion and
[42:30] trillion dollars of flows into Bitcoin
[42:33] ETFs I think that's going to be the
[42:35] major story moving forward um until the
[42:38] Structured Products get their hands on
[42:40] it so once Structured Products get their
[42:43] hands on this thing then it's going to
[42:45] make what the ETFs do look like what the
[42:48] ETFs did to the existing Market the
[42:51] market is just infinitely bigger because
[42:54] now we're dealing with institution Bond
[42:55] markets and what's really odd about this
[42:58] is
[42:58] that two things are going to play out
[43:01] and this is where the exponentiality of
[43:03] the Bitcoin price is going to really
[43:05] become apparent is that as the price of
[43:08] Bitcoin goes up bigger players who play
[43:11] in much different scales can now get
[43:14] involved with Bitcoin so it's like a if
[43:18] I describe this it's like an upside down
[43:20] pyramid that you know at the moment
[43:22] we're near the tip of it at the bottom
[43:25] so we've only just gone up to the next
[43:26] layer as far as institutional money goes
[43:29] then we're going to go up another layer
[43:31] where there's a different layer of
[43:32] Institutions and we're looking at
[43:34] Structured Products and and the like and
[43:36] then there's a layer above that when it
[43:38] comes to governments and central banks
[43:40] so we've got multiple layers to get to
[43:42] and when you overlay that with the fact
[43:46] that we're seeing demand for Bitcoin and
[43:50] the supply of it more importantly
[43:53] diminish so we've got a hard cap
[43:55] everyone knows it's 21 milli and that's
[43:57] it but what most people in traditional
[44:00] Finance don't really understand is is
[44:03] that that available Supply as that
[44:04] increasing credit comes to Market is
[44:07] getting is like a traditional triangle
[44:10] so at the moment you know there was a
[44:11] huge amount of Bitcoin available 10
[44:13] years ago you know less than 15 well
[44:16] less than 14 years ago you know there
[44:18] was Bitcoin foret which you put in your
[44:20] email and they'd send you free Bitcoin
[44:23] that's how cheap it was people were
[44:26] literally giving this thing away and so
[44:29] it was you know there was more more than
[44:31] enough to go around but as people have
[44:35] realize what this thing does and what it
[44:36] can do and the applications of it it's
[44:39] getting increasingly scarcer so now
[44:41] we're getting to a pointy the pointy end
[44:44] of the supply where there's not a lot of
[44:47] Supply but we are having the largest
[44:49] pools of capital coming to bitcoin and
[44:52] so what's that going to do that creates
[44:54] the exponentiality of the Bitcoin price
[44:57] so this is where I look at this and
[44:59] think a lot of people don't really
[45:01] comprehend the fact that there is so
[45:03] little Bitcoin available for these new
[45:06] pools of capital which are significantly
[45:08] bigger um than the ETFs that we've seen
[45:10] come to Market so
[45:13] um really probably um none of us a
[45:17] bullish enough on bitcoin over the next
[45:19] 5 to 10 years and um I think it'll
[45:21] surprise everyone to the
[45:23] upside nobody's ready for what's what's
[45:26] Bitcoin do going to do I think yes I'm
[45:28] totally agree with that one I think it's
[45:31] it's crazy to think about what can
[45:32] happen um we having an Android team in
[45:35] the podcast where the previous guest
[45:37] asks a question to the next guest
[45:39] without knowing who is the next guest
[45:41] it's a little bit like the blockchain
[45:43] like the the guests are somehow
[45:45] connected to each other
[45:48] that's I love that thing I stole it from
[45:51] the Diary of a CEO uh who was not in
[45:53] Bitcoin not in in anything of that but I
[45:55] Lov this and I was like this is like the
[45:58] blockchain um the question to you is and
[46:01] it's completely unrelated to uh anything
[46:04] we talked about today uh and this is
[46:07] what I like about those those questions
[46:09] who do you think will win the
[46:11] presidential election in the USA Today
[46:13] this year boy that is that's a nasty
[46:17] question I wanna I want to find out
[46:19] after who asked that but
[46:22] um boy oh boy that's that's such a tough
[46:26] tough thing to answer because you know I
[46:30] uh I look at it and I think you know
[46:32] it's got to be Joe Biden but you know
[46:35] only because Trump will probably get
[46:37] murdered before he gets the presidency
[46:41] so I shouldn't joke about that because
[46:44] you know it's a horrible thing to think
[46:45] but um
[46:47] sadly that's that's a 5050 if if Trump
[46:50] can make it to you know being elected he
[46:53] he he will more than likely get up but
[46:55] um you know um Joe Biden you know stands
[47:00] for
[47:01] re-election he's got a really good
[47:03] chance of winning too so um oh what a
[47:06] tough question that's a nasty question
[47:09] Robin
[47:11] yes I I I I like this kind of questions
[47:14] because uh it comes from someone else so
[47:17] it's not my question but it's always
[47:19] interesting to see and with not knowing
[47:21] who is the next guest uh because I try
[47:24] to make questions for the guest uh so
[47:27] then there's one question coming up
[47:30] which is completely outside of of the
[47:32] guest sometimes it's it's fitting really
[47:34] well uh but most of the time it does not
[47:36] fit well but it's an interesting but I
[47:40] appreciate your your your answer and I
[47:42] appreciate also your time I think it was
[47:44] an a great Insight in in your thinking
[47:47] of Bitcoin it was a great insight for
[47:49] people uh wanting to learn more about
[47:51] Bitcoin in general and yeah um I'm
[47:55] Before I Let You Go we can people find
[47:57] you the best where can people like get
[47:59] in touch with you ask you questions the
[48:01] best
