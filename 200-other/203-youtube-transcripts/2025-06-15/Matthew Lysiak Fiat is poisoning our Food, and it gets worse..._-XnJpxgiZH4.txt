[00:00] in America we're very very sick
[00:01] Americans ate meat for breakfast lunch
[00:04] and dinner corporations have been
[00:05] pushing the idea of plant-based diets
[00:07] because it's far more profitable if
[00:10] you're only eating Doritos and cereal
[00:12] you really don't notice the consequences
[00:14] of monetary inflation and money printing
[00:16] but if you're eating animal-based
[00:17] products like eggs milk steak you really
[00:20] realize this and you feel it red meat is
[00:23] becoming increasingly a food of the
[00:25] upper classes the Obesity rates are
[00:27] through the roof the people are only
[00:29] partially to we've been lied to and
[00:31] we've been lied to for political reason
[00:33] the most striking thing I've noticed
[00:35] about carnivore is that my mind is more
[00:37] efficient the reason that they began
[00:39] getting into the business of food and
[00:41] telling us what to eat is almost
[00:43] exclusively due to the fact that they're
[00:45] trying very hard to maintain power the
[00:47] whole milk got substituted out for
[00:49] lowfat milk but nobody likes lowfat milk
[00:51] so what did they do they shoved it full
[00:53] of strawberry sugaring and chocolate
[00:55] flavored sugaring we shift it from Whole
[00:57] milal to our kids drinking strawberry
[00:59] flavor lowfat milk or chocolate favored
[01:01] low fat milk that has as much sugar as
[01:03] soda the carnivore diet more or less is
[01:05] is the base diet that's what people have
[01:07] been eating for thousands of years
[01:08] they're lying to us about our food
[01:10] that's insane and they did knowingly
[01:12] they know that fro Loops are not
[01:14] healthier than eggs they know that yet
[01:16] they're telling us
[01:20] that we often discuss on on this channel
[01:23] how Bitcoin can change things how
[01:26] Bitcoin can influence certain uh types
[01:30] of Our Lives outside of money I mean
[01:32] money is kind of obvious uh and I think
[01:34] food is an really interesting one uh
[01:36] syon mentioned it a little bit in in his
[01:38] book now he wrote you wrote a book uh
[01:41] and I think he's co-author or he wrote
[01:44] something with it I think is with sa
[01:47] Musa saw the book um maybe let's talk
[01:50] about first like how did you come to the
[01:52] book idea how did this all start and
[01:55] then why why our food is wrong I'm an
[01:59] investigative reporter
[02:00] I worked for a little over a decade for
[02:03] the New York daily news which at the
[02:05] time when I was there was the fifth
[02:07] biggest paper in America my job was to
[02:11] parachute into breaking news stories so
[02:13] I
[02:14] covered between 2008 and 200 you know uh
[02:19] 14 probably every one of the big
[02:22] National stories you've heard of so I've
[02:24] always been very curious and skeptical
[02:27] of government when Co hit it took it to
[02:31] a new level for me and I began going
[02:33] down rabbit holes of
[02:35] Economics which led me to sa Adena moose
[02:39] I read the Bitcoin standard which I
[02:41] found fascinating but it was his book
[02:43] the Fiat standard which really triggered
[02:47] some changes in perspective on my end in
[02:50] particular chapter eight of the Fiat
[02:53] standard was about how our food system
[02:55] was
[02:56] corrupted on its face I thought the
[02:59] allegation amose made which was that our
[03:02] food has been hijacked by this
[03:04] conspiracy through these religious
[03:07] groups corporate influence and then the
[03:10] government trying to obscure the
[03:13] consequences of monetary inflation I
[03:15] thought it was
[03:16] absurd and I began as an investigative
[03:20] reporter just sort of factchecking this
[03:22] chapter and what I realized was that not
[03:27] only was safine correct but if anything
[03:30] he had understated the case and I looked
[03:33] at this as quite possibly the
[03:36] most
[03:38] consequential coverup of the last 50
[03:41] years I mean look in America we're very
[03:44] very sick so I approached safine and I
[03:46] wanted to dive in on this I I've
[03:49] published with Simon and Schuster Harper
[03:51] Collins Scholastic all the major
[03:52] Publishers I knew none of them based on
[03:55] this topic would be willing to give this
[03:58] book a chance
[04:00] I wanted to publish this on our own
[04:03] safine agreed he has a fantastic Network
[04:06] he started his own Publishing House I
[04:08] became his first author and on September
[04:11] 23rd of last year we released Fiat food
[04:13] really cool uh so now like let's let's
[04:16] just dive into the most obvious question
[04:18] why is something wrong with our food
[04:21] what you find happening
[04:23] is in the early 1900s leading up to
[04:28] 1970 American ate meat for breakfast
[04:32] lunch and dinner um they
[04:35] sticked primarily to the food that their
[04:38] ancestors have eaten for thousands of
[04:41] years before that meat but on August
[04:45] 15th 1971 something changes previous to
[04:48] August 15th 1971 in 1970 Americans on on
[04:52] average ate about 155 pounds of meat A
[04:55] year red
[04:56] meat this started shifting dramatically
[04:59] after 1971 and the significance of this
[05:02] date is Richard Nixon on August
[05:05] 15th decoupled from the gold standard so
[05:09] previous to August 15th
[05:12] 1971 foreign Banks could redeem their
[05:15] dollars into for into the uh United
[05:19] States Treasury for gold American
[05:21] citizens couldn't but foreign Banks
[05:24] could and this provided a powerful
[05:25] restraint on spending but when Nixon
[05:29] coupled from gold what we realize and
[05:32] what we see through I did over 200
[05:34] Freedom of Information
[05:36] requests is that the government begins
[05:40] Shifting the nation's food supply and
[05:43] they do this
[05:44] intentionally and one thing that really
[05:47] struck me was that governments seem very
[05:49] aware that endless war and
[05:53] Corruption the American voter and in
[05:56] general voters around the world seem to
[05:58] tolerate but when food prices go too
[06:01] high there's riots and social upheaval I
[06:06] can point to uh Sri Lanka in 2022 where
[06:10] the soaring cost of meat and eggs and
[06:14] milk large were were largely responsible
[06:18] for 200 300,000 people um going to the
[06:23] palace and and the leaders had to flee
[06:25] the country according to the American
[06:27] University there are over 12,500 food
[06:29] and energy related riots in Europe in
[06:31] 2022 alone so they're very sensitive the
[06:35] governments are very sensitive about the
[06:37] correlation between the rising cost of
[06:39] food and political
[06:43] instability so what you see
[06:45] after we decoupled from gold is
[06:50] basically a 55-year scop to convince us
[06:53] that the food we've eaten as a species
[06:55] for thousands of years is no longer
[06:57] appropriate for our diet and in instead
[06:59] we should be eating cheaper
[07:01] mass-produced
[07:03] grains which if you're only if you're
[07:06] only eating duritos and cereal you
[07:08] really don't notice the consequences of
[07:11] monetary inflation and money printing
[07:13] but if you're eating animal-based
[07:14] products like eggs milk steak you really
[07:18] realize this and you feel it I mean in
[07:20] America today red meat is becoming
[07:23] increasingly a food of the upper classes
[07:25] and cost prohibitive for the lower and
[07:28] middle classes
[07:30] and this isn't without very dire
[07:32] consequences if you walk into any
[07:34] Walmart in America and just look in line
[07:36] You'll see the Obesity rates are through
[07:40] the roof and the people are only
[07:42] partially to blame we've been lied to
[07:44] and we've been lied to for political
[07:46] reasons um and and Fiat food my book
[07:50] walks step by step through the process
[07:52] of not only how that happened but the
[07:54] motive behind it really interesting so
[07:56] so the food chain is the origin of the
[08:00] problem basically and they the the
[08:03] approach of keeping cost of food down so
[08:06] people don't realize that inflation is
[08:08] actually way worse than than it is did I
[08:11] understand the problem
[08:12] correct yeah and also to understand the
[08:15] political climate of the 1970s there was
[08:17] a concern that we were it wasn't global
[08:21] warming back then that's not what people
[08:23] were freaking out about people were
[08:24] upset about overpopulation they were
[08:26] concerned in particular that
[08:30] there was going to be too many people
[08:32] and not enough food and that meat was
[08:35] resource intensive so that we also
[08:37] needed to switch to grain so it was a
[08:39] Confluence of different events that led
[08:42] to this and also corporations have been
[08:44] pushing the idea of plant-based diets
[08:47] because it's far more profitable
[08:51] to have the nation eating grains like
[08:55] 14th century peasants as opposed to meat
[08:59] because because you can basically print
[09:02] corn like the same way you can print
[09:04] Fiat dollars just you can do it at scale
[09:07] and just um you know I have four
[09:10] daughters and if I buy five boxes of
[09:14] cereal it's pretty cheap I could feed my
[09:16] whole family and everybody will be full
[09:19] but the problem is the nutrients
[09:21] required for humans to
[09:22] thrive has gone exceedingly high so if
[09:27] people really understood
[09:29] and wanted to eat real
[09:31] food it they would take it and and they
[09:34] saw what was
[09:35] happening they would take it out on
[09:37] their political leaders and right now
[09:41] the we're sort of in this in America
[09:43] we're in this situation where we're not
[09:46] where the true consequences of inflation
[09:48] have been hidden from us but you see it
[09:50] in the in the human body of the the
[09:52] average American so so is uh the
[09:55] plant-based and weaken diets uh um a
[09:58] Cause of fear than the monetary policy
[10:02] uh or is it something that would have
[10:04] came up
[10:05] anyways um there would always there's
[10:08] always been well not always I assume
[10:12] there would be people who ate still ate
[10:14] plants but a lot of the nutrition
[10:16] science that people have relied on that
[10:20] claims to
[10:22] be science and Advocate Advocate the
[10:26] eating of plants it's not really science
[10:29] it's more like uh
[10:32] marketing and IT mostly comes from one
[10:35] University in California called Lal IND
[10:37] University which gets since 1971 when
[10:40] Fiat could just print out dollars has
[10:42] gotten hundreds of millions of dollars
[10:44] in government grants and it's run by I
[10:47] know this is this I'm going a lot of
[10:49] places here but just bear with me it's
[10:51] very
[10:52] complicated the university is run by the
[10:54] Seventh Day Adventist Church it's not a
[10:57] conspiracy it's just on their website
[10:59] and they're a group that believes and
[11:01] they believe honestly that um eating
[11:05] meat is a sin and that it makes your
[11:07] body
[11:08] impure and they've been heavily
[11:10] influential in the field of nutrition
[11:13] and they the ones who are generating
[11:16] these studies which aren't actual
[11:17] studies they just sort of validate the
[11:20] religious conviction so not to get too
[11:22] far into the Weeds on science but
[11:24] there's really two main kinds of studies
[11:26] there's observational studies and
[11:29] these observational studies cannot
[11:31] establish causal relations essentially I
[11:35] can do a study that says I've pulled 100
[11:37] people who had cancer and 97 of them
[11:40] have had milk at some point so based on
[11:43] that I can say milk linked to cancer and
[11:46] that's a headline that comes out they're
[11:49] not double blind controlled studies
[11:51] which can establish causal relationship
[11:53] so it's it it's phony science and I
[11:56] spoke to a lot of scientists who sort of
[11:58] explained that these sort of studies
[12:00] aren't done for other scientists they're
[12:02] done to generate headlines
[12:05] to guide public perception and that's
[12:08] exactly what we've seen happen with our
[12:11] food supply there's a lot of people who
[12:13] think eating like a peasant from the
[12:15] 1400s is noble and
[12:18] virtuous whereas eating meat is somehow
[12:21] sinful or bad for our health when the
[12:24] exact opposite is true it's really
[12:26] interesting for me like I myself
[12:28] unfortunately did not dive too deep into
[12:30] into food and nutritions uh uh there is
[12:33] like so many opinions out there I think
[12:36] it's like really hard to dive deep into
[12:38] this this food topic because it's also
[12:41] weirdly enough such an emotional topic
[12:44] for so many people when you talk like oh
[12:47] I'm only eating meat I'm only eating
[12:49] plant pasted like people have such an
[12:52] emotional response even to to food so
[12:54] like oh you're eating this and you're
[12:55] saying that my diet is wrong um it's
[12:58] really interesting for me um I just did
[13:00] not do a proper research on that um what
[13:03] I noticed that that in the Bitcoin
[13:05] Community I think there are mostly um an
[13:10] animal based diet eaters but there are a
[13:14] growing number on plant-based diet
[13:16] eaters also um what I found fascinating
[13:20] is also they arguing with each other and
[13:23] the the lovingness even when they argue
[13:26] each other there's some things that both
[13:28] have have in common like they both argue
[13:30] for fresh food not processed food for
[13:33] like uh high quality food and not like
[13:36] you can do also like all the things with
[13:38] animal based with plant-based food um it
[13:42] is would you say is uh steak and all the
[13:45] memes that we see on on Twitter is that
[13:48] the the sound money uh Bitcoin food or
[13:51] is it's more like fresh food look after
[13:55] for for new nutrients like what is
[13:59] Bitcoin or sound money food uh for you
[14:02] well the relation I would say is
[14:05] that a hard currency like Bitcoin is our
[14:08] natural state of
[14:10] existence it's in line with reality
[14:13] whereas there isn't some third party
[14:15] with a printing press that can
[14:19] just take away I mean in America the
[14:22] idea that you own your dollar bill is
[14:24] really just a slogan you don't own a
[14:26] dollar bill because there's a third
[14:27] party that can print an unlimited Supply
[14:30] and you have no say over that so they
[14:32] actually are the ones in control of your
[14:34] labor it's it's not the individual
[14:37] that's not the natural state of human
[14:38] existence we we um for most
[14:42] of our time on Earth we've
[14:46] traded goods for other Goods there
[14:48] hasn't been a third party siphoning
[14:51] things off I mean there were in Rome in
[14:53] times a little bit you see it but
[14:55] generally it reverts back to gold or
[14:57] silver gold was better I think bitcoin's
[15:00] an evolution of that but also in the
[15:01] same way I think um I plan there's no
[15:06] historical precedent to say that a
[15:08] society can just eat plants and be
[15:11] healthy I think plants are amazing I
[15:12] think they're wonderful medicines um but
[15:16] if you look at the Messi tribe in Africa
[15:21] who have been studied a lot and they
[15:24] only eat meat they only drink raw milk
[15:28] and and and sometimes honey but or the
[15:33] Inu in Alaska these are groups of people
[15:35] that exist on a strictly animal-based
[15:38] diet almost exclusively and they don't
[15:41] have any of the health problems that we
[15:43] have in modern America and I don't think
[15:45] that's a coincidence you can't really
[15:47] point to any group of people who've
[15:49] subsisted on plants for any amount of
[15:52] time and being able to continue and
[15:54] prosper I don't think that's not to say
[15:56] that um plants have no place I mean I
[15:59] I'm not I know PE I know what you're
[16:01] saying people get oddly religious about
[16:03] this um and it's it's kind of
[16:06] frustrating to sometimes have these
[16:10] discussions I mean I think if you can
[16:12] eliminate sugar into processed foods
[16:15] you're way ahead of the game already
[16:18] even if but I've tried I've tried
[16:20] personally I've tried plant-based a few
[16:21] years ago I didn't I didn't know and at
[16:24] first I felt great and it was because I
[16:26] cut out the sugar in the process Foods
[16:29] so I'm only eating these fresh fruits
[16:31] but in time my energy went um I am
[16:35] pretty strictly carnivore now I drink a
[16:37] lot of raw milk to keep myself out of
[16:39] ketosis and to keep my weight up and I'm
[16:43] very athletic I play you know I'm in a
[16:45] basketball league and I run every
[16:46] morning but the most striking thing I've
[16:48] noticed about carnivore is that my mind
[16:50] is more efficient I can remember more
[16:53] and I don't experience the ups and downs
[16:56] from the plants that I used to have from
[16:59] from significant amounts of
[17:00] carbohydrates are you eating carnivore
[17:03] in only meat or also with some
[17:06] vegetables like raw milk and only
[17:09] meat um cheese eggs meat I I stay away
[17:14] from vegetables I mean I don't think
[17:17] vegetables are are that bad if you can
[17:20] get them without being in America all of
[17:22] our vegetables are genetically altered
[17:25] and they're sprayed with extremely toxic
[17:27] chemical so every time I eat a vegetable
[17:30] I feel like I'm playing Russian roulette
[17:31] a little bit and the truth is I just
[17:32] don't feel as good so you know we can
[17:35] debate all you want and everybody could
[17:36] have these debates and I appreciate
[17:38] these debates
[17:39] but my body is the ultimate arbiture for
[17:42] what I put in myself and when I if I
[17:44] were to go eat you know some brussels
[17:46] sprouts right now I wouldn't feel great
[17:49] afterwards yeah I think uh I think it's
[17:53] really hard to say for me because I just
[17:55] did not do the the Deep research on that
[17:57] I definitely have to do that um but what
[18:00] I 100% agree with everyone saying like
[18:03] fresh food and be aware where you buy it
[18:07] like for example in Austria you have a
[18:09] lot of farmers where you can directly
[18:11] buy from a farmer no matter if it's uh
[18:14] PLS or raw milk or meat you actually see
[18:18] like you can see where the M&L are they
[18:21] they're doing it on Farm there's nothing
[18:23] in between uh you can talk with the guy
[18:26] who does everything so I like that a lot
[18:28] where you can directly get the meat from
[18:31] from the farmer uh and get your milk and
[18:34] and all the things like my my uncle has
[18:36] a farm and I got most of my milk when I
[18:40] came up uh only from from there like we
[18:43] had always fresh raw milk directly from
[18:47] from the cow basically like two days
[18:49] after it came from the cow one day
[18:51] sometimes the same day so that was uh
[18:54] something that I noticed uh was really
[18:56] good for for my upbringing um but yeah
[18:59] the the food topic is is really
[19:01] interesting maybe maybe I have to at
[19:04] some point I have to uh make a a veg
[19:06] versus animl based carnivore uh debate
[19:10] with with two bitcoiners it would be
[19:11] interesting to see but the the bigger
[19:13] question that I have is does inflation
[19:17] has a direct impact on our
[19:21] health yeah it does it
[19:24] it's in the sense that inflation Mak Mak
[19:29] the nutrients that we need to thrive
[19:30] cost prohibitive and the entire
[19:34] propaganda campaign to convince us to
[19:36] eat plants and to stray from the diet
[19:39] humans have had for Generations all
[19:42] stems from the fact that the
[19:44] government's trying to hide the
[19:46] consequences of monetary inflation since
[19:49] 1971 when Nixon decoupled and we began
[19:51] printing all these dollars and you see
[19:53] these changes and you see these
[19:55] government policies in very specific
[19:58] ways man manest into our food supply for
[20:00] instance um Nixon
[20:03] appointed as agriculture secretary a man
[20:06] named Earl buts who then began
[20:09] pushing millions of Fiat dollars to
[20:12] subsidize to industries of corn soy and
[20:16] sugar as a result especially corn in
[20:20] America corn isn't everything we
[20:23] eat um you can't drink Coke without
[20:25] having corn syrup in it you're putting
[20:28] corn on your
[20:29] pancakes
[20:31] and soy and sugar are not far behind on
[20:34] that list but it's it's impossible to
[20:38] look at the Modern food supply and that
[20:40] doesn't even include the propaganda
[20:42] money going towards
[20:44] these
[20:46] campaigns disguised as science to
[20:49] convince people to
[20:51] eat or for instance January of 2023 um
[20:56] the tough food Compass came out which is
[20:59] funded largely by government and
[21:01] corporate interests and these are the
[21:04] experts of the world of nutrition
[21:06] they've spent their whole lives
[21:08] dedicated to nutrition what do they
[21:10] conclude they conclude that Froot Loops
[21:12] and Cinnamon Toast Crunch bars are
[21:15] healthier for people than meat and eggs
[21:17] I mean that's obviously not true that's
[21:20] dumb of course it's not true but you
[21:24] know this these recommendations by
[21:28] expert become law in America and what
[21:32] you see as a result for instance of the
[21:34] 1992 food pyramid in America where
[21:38] people were recommended to eat between 8
[21:40] to 11 servings of grains a day that
[21:44] becomes law in our public school system
[21:47] so almost every child in America
[21:50] throughout all of grade school is eating
[21:53] tons of grains and tons of sugar and by
[21:56] the time they come out of school they
[21:58] metabolically compromised I maintain
[22:01] that if Nixon never would have decoupled
[22:04] and there would no there would be no
[22:06] reason
[22:08] to hide the consequences of monetary
[22:10] inflation because there wouldn't be
[22:12] monetary inflation it would be very slow
[22:15] there be the government would have no
[22:17] business in in the industry of food the
[22:18] reason that they began getting into the
[22:20] business of food and telling us what to
[22:23] eat is largely due to the fact that
[22:26] they're almost exclusively due to the
[22:28] fact that they're trying very hard to
[22:31] maintain power and like I stated before
[22:35] if people were eating the diets
[22:37] essential to health they would be up in
[22:39] arms right now over the cost they
[22:41] wouldn't be able to afford it they would
[22:43] not be most Americans cannot afford to
[22:45] eat red meat drink raw milk drink the
[22:48] food that our great great great
[22:50] grandparents ate it's just not an option
[22:52] how do play how do does uh government
[22:55] subsidies play into this is uh
[22:58] government
[22:59] with subsidizing different kinds of food
[23:03] um also like incentivizing this Fiat
[23:07] food yeah of course that's all these
[23:09] government studies all these studies
[23:11] that come out almost exclusively are
[23:13] from government or corporate interests
[23:15] it's not science they're observational
[23:18] studies and like the tough food Compass
[23:21] which came out in 2023 or the dietary
[23:25] guidelines which came out the the
[23:27] pyramid which came out in 19 92 it's on
[23:30] its face it's absurd I mean the tubs
[23:34] food Compass which came out in 2023 it
[23:36] was a marketing campaign because that
[23:38] same month that same month
[23:41] Robin um 20 or I think yeah 60 Minutes
[23:44] one of the most uh prestigious news
[23:46] programs in America had a segment
[23:50] on um wovi the weight loss drug and two
[23:57] the two experts interviewed had both
[24:00] been paid by Novo Nordisk the parent
[24:03] company and they were proposing this
[24:06] idea which is becoming mainstream now
[24:08] that obesity is not the result of
[24:12] lifestyle choices but it's a brain
[24:13] disease a genetic brain disease and that
[24:17] W goie and these weight loss shots are
[24:20] really the only way to fix this now I
[24:22] consider these people the doctor in
[24:25] particular Dr Fatima Stanford is the one
[24:27] who was interviewed dud who was a paid
[24:29] consultant for Nova Nordisk while
[24:31] promoting in a new show this drug I
[24:34] consider her evil in the sense that what
[24:36] she's doing is undermining something so
[24:39] essential to Being Human which is our
[24:42] ability to control the outcomes of the
[24:45] things most fundamental to our own
[24:47] existence which is our health right like
[24:49] she's saying no no trust the white codes
[24:51] trust the doctors Outsource your
[24:53] judgment the Lucky Charms are fine it's
[24:56] not because you're eating three
[24:57] cheesecakes every mning and Doritos it's
[25:00] it's not your fault and that's the way
[25:04] America is Shifting right now and I
[25:05] would argue heavily that it's this tide
[25:08] that's pushing in this direction and
[25:11] it's I consider it evil because it's
[25:14] leading to the direct death and sickness
[25:16] of most most Americans over 50% of
[25:20] American children right now are
[25:22] pre-diabetic by some measures and we're
[25:26] not like we're not seeing the connection
[25:28] ction I mean the increase in the amount
[25:30] of sugar we've eaten since 1970 because
[25:32] for instance as one example for why
[25:34] sugars exploded Public Schools used to
[25:37] be able to drink whole milk that used to
[25:39] be served to every public school in
[25:40] America whole milk and when the
[25:45] 1992 food pyramid came out saturated fat
[25:49] was buil as evil so the raw milk got I
[25:54] mean the the whole milk got substituted
[25:56] out for lowfat milk but nobody likes
[25:58] low-fat milk it tastes terrible it
[26:00] tastes like water it's disgusting so
[26:02] what did they do in America they shoved
[26:04] it full of strawberry sugaring and
[26:07] chocolate flavored chipping so now in
[26:09] the public schools instead of we shifted
[26:12] from whole milk to our kids drinking
[26:14] strawberry flavored lowfat milk or
[26:17] chocolate flavored lowfat milk that has
[26:19] as much sugar as
[26:20] soda well at the same time the soda
[26:24] companies are funding exclusive
[26:26] contracts with individual schools in our
[26:27] country
[26:28] to keep soda available in the public
[26:31] schools so by the time these kids come
[26:33] out of school they're metabolically
[26:35] compromised and it's not an accident my
[26:38] argument is it's intentional not to the
[26:41] extent that our government wants us to
[26:42] make us sick they don't our government
[26:44] isn't intentionally trying to make
[26:46] people sick I don't believe that um but
[26:48] what I do believe is that they've
[26:50] created an incentive process to obscure
[26:53] the consequences of monetary inflation
[26:56] that has led directly to that result I
[26:58] also think that's a systematic uh
[27:01] problem not like someone evil wants to
[27:03] destroy the planet and wants to make
[27:05] everyone sick um what what role does uh
[27:09] do big corporations uh you uh play in
[27:12] this as you talked before uh that
[27:15] plant-based is more profitable uh what
[27:18] what role does this play yeah it's
[27:20] interesting in my book Fiat food I track
[27:22] through how corporations have had a
[27:24] pretty large role in this and you can go
[27:26] back to before we want the gold standard
[27:29] you could go back to the 40s and the 50s
[27:32] when corporations first started uh um
[27:37] actually the the first example I'll use
[27:38] goes even before that there was a
[27:42] Proctor and Gamble made lots of candles
[27:45] with cotton seed oil and they had this
[27:47] extra cotton seed oil after we
[27:48] transitioned to light bulbs they didn't
[27:50] know what to do with it so they made
[27:54] margarine and you know they tried
[27:57] selling this to people but in New York
[27:59] City in the early days it was a huge
[28:01] Scandal it was called o margarine and
[28:03] they were trying to substitute it for
[28:05] butter but it was people didn't regard
[28:08] it as food like this this isn't food
[28:10] this is what is this and there were
[28:12] riots over this and law suits and Court
[28:16] battles um that made sure that people
[28:20] knew that this wasn't real food that
[28:22] this wasn't butter cuz the whole gimmick
[28:25] of oo margarine was to make it seem like
[28:27] it was butter in the beginning and
[28:29] people really resisted and they did they
[28:32] resisted again when they tried
[28:35] substituting L for these seed
[28:39] oils and it took a long time but a very
[28:42] extensive marketing campaign by Proctor
[28:44] and
[28:45] Gamble which included phony science um
[28:49] Proctor and Gamble would
[28:51] later be the primary funer of the
[28:54] American Heart
[28:56] Association they essentially start
[28:58] started the American Heart Association
[28:59] so the American Heart Association was a
[29:01] very small group and Proctor and Gamble
[29:03] gave them flooded them with money and
[29:06] then suddenly they began saying that
[29:09] these seed oils and these vegetable oils
[29:12] which again marketing's amazing because
[29:15] most people don't recognize cotton seed
[29:17] as a vegetable I mean wait when did that
[29:19] happen right like cotton seed's not a
[29:21] vegetable but they began transitioning
[29:24] people into the big the the the amazing
[29:27] accomplishment of these companies was to
[29:29] convince people and it took a while that
[29:33] these items that were not regular parts
[29:35] of the American food supply were
[29:38] actually better for us than the food
[29:40] we've been eating for Generations so out
[29:42] goes lar out goes to we're convinced
[29:45] that that's now bad for us beginning in
[29:47] the 50s but in comes
[29:50] krisco in comes these other weird
[29:53] atrocities of Science and still though
[29:57] still despite all of this come
[30:00] 1970 people are still eating lard and
[30:05] meat and 155 pounds a year but when you
[30:09] see the tilt of the Fiat money printer
[30:11] which was in reality able to weaponize
[30:14] the entire productive labor of not just
[30:17] America but since the bread and Wood's
[30:19] agreement in
[30:21] 1944 the entire world you see this
[30:24] powerful shift occur through the funding
[30:27] of
[30:28] of false nutrition science direct
[30:33] subsidies and then government mandated
[30:35] Health policies which the government I
[30:38] mean government never really talked to
[30:41] people what told people what to eat
[30:43] before I mean it's like wolves don't
[30:45] need the government to tell them what to
[30:46] eat we were a specific species it wasn't
[30:48] really controversial people really
[30:50] shouldn't need to buy my book to to know
[30:53] what to eat it's it's instinctual but
[30:55] we've been confused and it's
[30:58] intentional like you mentioned earlier
[31:00] when we were talking that it's kind of
[31:01] confusing there's so much noise out
[31:03] there that's by intent absolutely um you
[31:06] mentioned seed oils and uh this is
[31:08] something that comes up a lot in in in
[31:11] Bitcoin I think even if you did not
[31:14] study anything about food but you have
[31:16] been on bitcoin Twitter you know that
[31:19] seed oils are evil I think that's that's
[31:22] something that comes up so much with
[31:24] bitcoiners so why are uh seed oils not
[31:28] good for us I mean it's Robin it's like
[31:31] the same reason eating aluminum foil is
[31:33] probably not good for us it's just it's
[31:35] not food it's I there's there's far
[31:38] better experts who could go into the
[31:40] toxicity and why it's just it's really
[31:43] just not food but they' put it in there
[31:46] it's cheap it's so easy to make it's
[31:49] Industrial Waste
[31:52] um yeah I haven't I haven't had fried
[31:55] food in well that's a correction in
[31:59] Austin Texas there's a place that makes
[32:01] french fries out of lard like they used
[32:03] to they friy it in lard it's delicious
[32:06] but yeah it's not it's just not food I I
[32:09] wish I had a a more elaborate
[32:10] explanation but yeah seed oils aren't
[32:12] part of our food supply they should
[32:13] shouldn't be if you watch or listen to
[32:16] my podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[32:18] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[32:21] the most important step is to keep the
[32:24] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[32:26] wallet my personal recommendation for
[32:28] hardare wallet is the bitbox it's super
[32:31] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[33:30] but not least I have something
[33:32] completely new for you guys I partnered
[33:35] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[33:38] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[33:41] saw created by anyone look at that
[33:44] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[33:47] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[33:50] the perfect subtle elent way to go out
[33:53] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[33:56] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[33:59] make sure to check out the link in the
[34:01] description for those amazing coin
[34:03] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[34:06] amazing I love them so much it was
[34:08] really hard for me to pick the one that
[34:10] I want to have because there are a lot
[34:12] of great options I went with the new
[34:14] transparency Edition they're all limited
[34:18] so grab yours those will not be
[34:20] available for a long time but there will
[34:22] come new models and new amazing designs
[34:25] along the way all it's it's it's
[34:27] interesting do you know what um which
[34:30] countries you mentioned an example
[34:32] before which countries are the closest
[34:35] to to the sound money food uh still is
[34:38] is there some some examples that you can
[34:40] name where like there there in the world
[34:43] it's the best or is the whole world kind
[34:45] of already on a feat food standard no
[34:49] there's a growing amount of people who
[34:51] are seeing through the gaslighting
[34:54] campaign
[34:55] and I would say the perfect food is the
[34:58] ribeye
[34:59] steak because it has a lot of fat which
[35:03] is required for humans to thrive
[35:06] but I think you could achieve Health
[35:09] through ground beef and cheaper
[35:11] alternatives like eggs and raw milk and
[35:14] I don't think all plants are going to
[35:16] kill you I think plants are primarily
[35:18] great as medicine but historically you
[35:21] know historically you see people
[35:23] eating plants at times um but not like
[35:27] today I mean for instance in the
[35:28] Northeast in America you might have
[35:30] berries available for just a few weeks
[35:33] out of the year before berries get to
[35:36] them but I live in Arizona now in the
[35:38] south in the southwest where I shouldn't
[35:41] be eating
[35:42] berries now like there it's just people
[35:46] eating berries all year
[35:48] round um it's probably not natural and I
[35:51] I tend to believe that what is natural
[35:54] is best both with economics and with
[35:57] food food and I think they're very
[35:58] related that's interesting when you pick
[36:00] up like berries or bananas or something
[36:03] like that in Austria you're like oh my
[36:05] banana was there I want to make their
[36:08] holidays but I don't want to buy my
[36:09] banana from
[36:10] there because had a long way way from
[36:13] there yeah and I think that's something
[36:15] everyone has to agree on uh like if if
[36:18] you buy things that have been on so long
[36:22] of way or has been manipulated or
[36:25] pesticides for for so long that that
[36:28] cannot be healthy even if you wash the
[36:30] food before you eat it that that does
[36:32] not make a difference uh and and that's
[36:35] that's just that's just not right uh
[36:38] even all all with the the the
[36:40] plant-based food I mean the the biggest
[36:42] thing that I hate is like those
[36:44] plantbased uh meat subsidies where it's
[36:47] just
[36:50] likein this so terrible man come on
[36:54] absolutely it's like a chemical [ __ ]
[36:57] storm like it's it's they're it's
[37:00] it's ah yeah I mean it's pretty bad
[37:03] but it look I've done it too I I've been
[37:06] through the whole you look very healthy
[37:07] by the way um it's it's a journey and
[37:12] it's difficult and it's hard because a
[37:13] lot of these Foods they hav us on are
[37:15] very addictive and the more you eat them
[37:17] the less willpower you have it it wears
[37:20] away at your actual willpower as well so
[37:23] I don't fault people for eating crappy
[37:26] food and being addicted to sugar um it's
[37:29] hard and unlike
[37:31] heroin you can't sit down for 5 minutes
[37:34] without being bombarded for an ad for
[37:37] peanut butter cups and Snickers
[37:39] bars it's something you know it's it's
[37:42] difficult so I have a lot of compassion
[37:43] for I was overweight myself um I ate a
[37:47] lot of really really bad food and when I
[37:49] was a teenager I got cancer I had
[37:52] osteogenic sarcoma in my leg um so I
[37:56] mean health is
[37:58] in and I'm convinced it was because of
[38:01] my dietary choices I was a product of
[38:04] the 1990s food pyramid which
[38:08] emphasized eating no meat because they
[38:11] had a false notion that saturated fat
[38:13] found meat led to Heart ailments and to
[38:16] increase these artificial fats which I
[38:19] think are just complete toxins and I was
[38:22] overweight and I got very sick and I I
[38:25] never forgot that which is I think part
[38:27] of the reason I was always so interested
[38:28] in this field trying to find out why why
[38:32] our food system went went this route
[38:34] let's come to to the solution um because
[38:37] I think it's such a systemic problem
[38:40] that I think just advertising uh it will
[38:44] will not help a long term I think we we
[38:46] definitely need uh some some uh more
[38:50] fundamental solution and I feel like
[38:52] Bitcoin probably is for me at least uh
[38:55] the solution that can fix the thing do
[38:58] you also think so that that Bitcoin when
[39:00] we have like a sound man standard that
[39:02] this sound food standard uh also comes
[39:06] back and and why will Bitcoin fix fat
[39:11] food if it does it it does and well let
[39:14] me appra it like this Bitcoin does
[39:16] nothing for food specifically absolutely
[39:18] nothing what it does do is it ends the
[39:22] Distortion of current monetary policy
[39:26] right now we're living in this bizarre
[39:28] world where because of the Fiat money
[39:31] printer it can guide public opinion and
[39:35] what Bitcoin would do or truthfully any
[39:37] hard currency it wouldn't have to be
[39:39] Bitcoin I just think Bitcoin is better
[39:41] than gold and I outlined the reasons why
[39:42] in my book Gold inevitably gets
[39:45] centralized and confiscated I mean it's
[39:48] it's a it's a pattern that always
[39:49] happens it's like we're going to have
[39:51] gold people have a gold standard and
[39:53] then everybody puts their gold in Banks
[39:55] and gets paper notes and then the
[39:57] government declares an emergency and
[39:58] says the economy is tanking because of
[40:00] greedy people we need to seize all the
[40:02] goal happens every time um bitcoin's
[40:04] better centralized if you have your own
[40:07] if you have your own
[40:08] um if you self custody but what Bitcoin
[40:13] would do every time you buy a little bit
[40:15] of Bitcoin you take a stab at the
[40:17] Federal Reserve and it would end the
[40:20] incent there be no incentive for the
[40:22] Federal Reserve to distort our food
[40:26] supply if
[40:27] there's no monetary inflation people
[40:31] would just be allowed to make their own
[40:32] decisions and I'm convinced that people
[40:34] left to their own Vice are generally
[40:36] pretty smart what we have in America is
[40:39] a a a a
[40:40] a infinite amount of dollars have
[40:43] flooded the zone to confuse people about
[40:46] what to eat for the past 55 years to
[40:48] create this fad like people like to
[40:51] think the carnivore diet is a fat the
[40:52] carnivore diet more or less is is the
[40:55] base diet that's what people have been
[40:56] eating for thousands of years The Fad is
[40:59] the fact that we're eating Crisco for 55
[41:02] years and plastic foods that come in
[41:04] these insane wrappers full of
[41:07] preservative soy letin and all this
[41:09] garbage Bitcoin would end the incentive
[41:13] for the Federal Reserve to Alternative
[41:15] food supply because the reason you're
[41:17] doing it is to hide the consequences of
[41:19] inflation but without inflation what
[41:22] would be the purpose it's not they're
[41:24] not just doing it because they're evil
[41:25] they're doing it because they want to
[41:27] maintain power and I'll give you a quick
[41:30] story that illustrates my point um in
[41:33] the 1960s we were still on the gold
[41:35] standard but at that point we had
[41:37] already printed far more promissary
[41:39] notes than we had gold so Lyndon Johnson
[41:43] the president at the time was going
[41:45] through some inflation because he had
[41:47] printed too many dollars and he was
[41:50] considering running for re-election but
[41:52] there was a problem the price of eggs
[41:54] had gone up too much so
[41:57] people were very upset about the price
[41:59] of eggs going up so he called in his
[42:01] Surgeon General and he said
[42:04] look you need to write a phony press
[42:07] release tell people that eggs are bad
[42:09] for
[42:11] you and he did that and this is all
[42:14] recorded this isn't a conspiracy um a
[42:16] biographer named
[42:18] Samuelson documented this who worked for
[42:20] Lyndon Johnson in the book so Lyndon
[42:22] Johnson called in called in in his
[42:24] Surgeon General instructed him to write
[42:27] a phony press release saying that eggs
[42:30] made people sick what happened was the
[42:32] phony press release goes out this the
[42:35] the demand for eggs went down because
[42:37] people believed it the supply stayed the
[42:40] same so the price went down they
[42:43] manipulated the
[42:44] situation for political gain because
[42:47] they understood that the eggs going up
[42:49] in price was something that Housewives
[42:50] were really upset about and to this day
[42:54] people still believe that phony press
[42:56] release even though it's been exposed
[42:57] again and again is nonsense they believe
[43:00] that that press release the eggs are bad
[43:02] for you um and it's just absolutely
[43:05] amazing the length that people will go
[43:08] to maintain
[43:09] power because it's not as though they
[43:12] they they they're again it's not that
[43:13] they're trying to hurt us but what they
[43:14] do is they see us the American public as
[43:18] a means to an end and the end is always
[43:21] their empowerment at the detriment of
[43:24] our self autonomy and our physical
[43:26] health
[43:27] it's so interesting for me because I
[43:29] think right now um if You observe it
[43:33] there is a strong and stronger Community
[43:35] about people that want to know about
[43:38] food and really care about what they eat
[43:41] and but there's also like this this
[43:43] stronger and stronger movement where
[43:45] like the this fear food wave comes in
[43:48] and it it kind of becomes more popular
[43:50] are you um um positive that like in
[43:54] maybe 20 years or 30 years we we are on
[43:57] more of a um sound food system or will
[44:01] will this will it get worse before it
[44:04] gets better or do you have some some
[44:06] time framework that you to think about
[44:08] that unfortunately Robin I think it's
[44:11] going to get worse before it gets better
[44:13] um the
[44:15] current so to just go back a little
[44:18] bit there's red me and beef is difficult
[44:24] to it's difficult to process a cow ask
[44:26] any fun fer like you farmers in your
[44:28] family it's it's cost intensive it's
[44:30] it's a lot of Labor and for decades
[44:35] there's been reasons why we shouldn't
[44:39] eat red meat um in the 1940s the
[44:42] government told the American people not
[44:44] to eat red meat because we needed to
[44:46] save it for the soldiers fighting abroad
[44:47] to keep them strong and that we should
[44:49] plant Victory Gardens and then in the
[44:52] 70s we shouldn't eat red meat
[44:55] because red meat
[44:57] was too labor intensive and because of
[45:01] overpopulation we were all going to
[45:02] starve so we all needed to eat
[45:04] plants and then in the 80s they told us
[45:09] that red meat saturated fat found in red
[45:12] meat Rose cholesterol which caused heart
[45:16] attacks and then in the late 90s and
[45:19] early 2000s we're not supposed to eat
[45:21] red meat because it changes the
[45:23] temperature of the earth so you eating
[45:25] your red meat Chang the temperature of
[45:27] the earth um I mean and attributing like
[45:32] this is nothing new I mean you could go
[45:33] back to the 1500s when they used to
[45:36] blame eccentric women for uh who they
[45:39] would call witches for crops not coming
[45:42] up and they would burn them and appease
[45:44] to Gods like we've we really haven't
[45:46] changed that much but right
[45:50] now with global warming as the most
[45:52] recent reason why we can't or climate
[45:55] change they shifted it from global to
[45:57] climate change um in New York City for
[45:59] instance they're talking about
[46:01] eliminating me entirely from the public
[46:03] school system so right now there's
[46:06] meatless Mondays in public school but
[46:08] they're talking about increasing that to
[46:09] Wednesdays and Fridays and the momentum
[46:14] seems to be on the other side and the
[46:17] reason I really fear it's going to get
[46:18] worse before it gets better is because
[46:21] inflation is going to get worse so
[46:23] remember inflation takes a while to
[46:25] really be felt the inflation that
[46:28] happened when both Trump and then Biden
[46:32] flooded America with more dollars during
[46:35] covid is still being felt it's like it's
[46:39] like a big pillow fight where all these
[46:41] feathers go everywhere it takes time for
[46:43] the the feathers to settle so as
[46:47] inflation gets worse and meat becomes
[46:50] increasingly cost prohibitive you're
[46:52] going to see the gaslighting campaign to
[46:54] convince us more and more why we should
[46:57] be eating cheaper foods like
[46:59] grains and I think that's going to
[47:01] something that grows until
[47:06] inflation well there the inflation's
[47:09] there's no stopping it um in the near
[47:11] future so I don't know I I wish I had
[47:13] something Robin I want to be positive
[47:15] man I want to have something positive to
[47:17] say but I I can't imagine a situation
[47:20] where absent of ending the Federal
[47:23] Reserve the monetary gaslighting
[47:26] campaign
[47:28] reverse I just don't see it I mean there
[47:31] have been guests on that said that in
[47:34] the next five to 10 years the Federal
[47:36] Reserve will end uh I don't I don't see
[47:39] it personally because I think the the
[47:42] the power and the network effects they
[47:44] have is just way too strong uh to happen
[47:47] that quick uh but yeah maybe maybe we
[47:50] will be surprised by by the fast
[47:53] adoption of Bitcoin and the the fast
[47:54] decrease of the power of the the central
[47:56] bank who knows I would wish for it I I
[47:59] don't see it right now I mean we can
[48:01] even see it in in in in Turkey for
[48:03] example have a major inflation rate they
[48:06] still used the Turkish L they did not
[48:08] switch to US dollars they did not switch
[48:10] to bitcoin but they still used that
[48:12] broken money like that's so obvious uh
[48:14] but it's also obvious in the US Dollars
[48:17] and for the Euros but not that obvious
[48:19] as in the turkey so I don't know how how
[48:22] long we can go but it seems that uh
[48:25] people believe that it's money and and
[48:27] they they Don't Ride On on the streets
[48:30] for it the they do it for other things
[48:32] but not not for money it feels like or
[48:35] to blame other things for it they blame
[48:37] uh rich people or big corporations on
[48:39] them and not the the system itself which
[48:43] which is interesting for me well I mean
[48:45] I think you're totally right and I would
[48:47] put blame on Academia in America we've
[48:52] if you go I love economics I would never
[48:54] have gone to any college in America to
[48:58] study economics it's all taught by
[49:00] Keynesian professors who are morons I
[49:03] mean they're just dumb like I don't know
[49:05] you ever try to for this book I had to
[49:07] go through a lot of their theories uh
[49:09] for instance the Keynesian multiplier
[49:11] effect try explaining that to a
[49:13] 9-year-old running a lemonade stand it
[49:15] it makes no sense that if you give the
[49:18] government more money it multiplies but
[49:20] if you keep it yourself individually it
[49:22] stagnates the purpose of Keynesian
[49:25] professors and who who dominate Academia
[49:28] and justify money printing is is
[49:31] literally just to play the role of Court
[49:33] Jester for the money printer and to once
[49:37] again kind of like they did with health
[49:39] during covid to have us Outsource our
[49:42] understanding because they have all
[49:44] these phds and what you have is because
[49:47] they're saying things that don't make
[49:48] sense a lot of really smart people just
[49:50] think gosh I just must not be smart
[49:53] enough to understand it no you are it's
[49:56] a con they've been running this Con for
[49:59] a while but I think to your point to be
[50:01] a little optimistic I think more and
[50:03] more people are beginning to catch on
[50:04] that maybe Paul Krugman is actually the
[50:08] [ __ ] and it's not me because he's been
[50:10] wrong every time he talks it makes a
[50:14] prediction and that that kind of thing
[50:16] matters I mean we there in America the
[50:20] memory hole hasn't gone into effect to
[50:23] the extent yet that they can't hide
[50:25] their past comments so we know when the
[50:27] President Joe Biden would say oh
[50:30] inflation is going down it's continuing
[50:32] to go down prices are never going down
[50:35] until the Federal Reserve either
[50:38] completely transforms or ends but it's a
[50:42] matter of how quickly they go up not
[50:44] whether they go up and nobody's ever
[50:46] talking about returning to 2020 prices
[50:49] that's
[50:50] done this is the new
[50:53] norm and I think there is a lot of
[50:55] interest I mean
[50:57] maybe even my podcast isn't attest to
[50:59] that because I'm completely new in
[51:01] Bitcoin podcasting I started half a year
[51:03] ago uh and and now have like around
[51:06] 40,000 weekly listeners and and Watchers
[51:08] of a Bitcoin podcast that is just half a
[51:10] year old and that's just YouTube That's
[51:12] not including Spotify or a or something
[51:15] like that because it's harder to track
[51:16] there um but it's man I I probably
[51:18] should have combed my hair I had no idea
[51:20] it's so many viewers no no no like I I
[51:23] publish daily so there's like seven
[51:25] episodes and around those episodes uh
[51:28] YouTube test congratulations yeah thank
[51:30] you thank you and I think that's just an
[51:32] attest to um people are hungry for those
[51:36] types of contents like people are hungry
[51:38] for for finding out what what's actually
[51:41] going on I think that's that's the major
[51:43] takeaway for me like if there would
[51:46] would not be a big demand for that uh
[51:49] there would not be like five six Bitcoin
[51:51] podcasts that are all really uh Bitcoin
[51:54] only podcast that are all growing really
[51:55] really quickly and they're all doing
[51:57] basically the same thing so like there's
[51:59] a a lot of Demand on on that and I see
[52:01] like people coming into the they're
[52:03] seeing the show and all of a sudden
[52:05] they're like two three days just
[52:07] watching like 20 episodes of mine so
[52:09] like the demand is is amazing and that's
[52:12] that gives me hope honestly the the
[52:14] replies that I get I mean I'm also
[52:16] living in a kind of a bubble that's
[52:18] because of that but uh it gives me all
[52:20] the hope for for for the future um
[52:24] yeah yeah Robin I think one of of the co
[52:27] was awful obviously but one of the
[52:29] bright spots was that it led a lot of
[52:33] people that I know personally including
[52:36] myself I grew up as somebody who trusted
[52:38] American institutions I I didn't think
[52:41] they always did the right thing but I
[52:43] never doubted their motives I I I
[52:45] thought these institutions in America
[52:47] were good they're they're they're built
[52:49] like people like me and we're the
[52:51] country that put the man on the moon I
[52:53] think and Co like it happened to me it
[52:58] jumped the shark as they say it it
[53:01] just they clearly lied about a lot of it
[53:04] I think covid was real the virus was
[53:07] real but there was also a lot of lies
[53:11] about it and um you know over and over
[53:14] again we were told that uh you know you
[53:16] get the vaccine for instance and you
[53:20] once you get the vaccine you can't
[53:21] spread it and you can't get it and this
[53:23] was said over and over again and I I I
[53:26] think one of the blessings is people are
[53:29] now thinking wow I think I think they
[53:31] lied to me and I'm they begin to look at
[53:34] everything differently now including
[53:35] myself I'm just I'm I was shocked I
[53:38] believed everything they said in the
[53:40] beginning luckily I didn't I didn't get
[53:42] any shots but I I believed them and I
[53:44] was like oh let some other people get
[53:45] the shot first to see how this goes and
[53:49] um I think that lack of trust has a
[53:53] parallel in people
[53:56] embracing their own self-autonomy and
[53:58] making decisions on their own like we
[54:00] don't I'm not a medical expert I'm not a
[54:03] doctor but I can smell a con I've been
[54:05] an investigative reporter for 20 years
[54:07] I've interviewed congressman and
[54:08] presidents I I I know when somebody's
[54:11] lying to me I four daughters I'm trained
[54:14] in understanding lies and this idea of
[54:19] like not just trying to reflect back on
[54:22] covid but like wow they're lying to us
[54:25] about our food dud that's insane what
[54:28] like
[54:30] that I can't look at anything to same
[54:32] anymore Robin like nothing in my life
[54:34] since writing Fiat food is the same
[54:36] nothing because I never in a million
[54:39] years would have thought that they would
[54:40] lie to us about our food supply but they
[54:43] did and they did knowingly they that the
[54:45] truth is out there and they know it they
[54:48] know that Froot Loops are not healthier
[54:49] than eggs they know that yet they're
[54:53] telling us that and they've gone too far
[54:56] are and a lot of people in the Bitcoin
[54:58] Community are very skeptically minded
[55:00] your audience is the kind of audience I
[55:03] think that is re-evaluating a lot of the
[55:05] premises that they've assumed these
[55:07] axioms that we've accepted I am too so
[55:10] I'm I'm kind of proud to be part of the
[55:11] movement but I also feel new like
[55:12] there's so much more I need to learn U
[55:15] my next book I'm working on is about
[55:18] Fiat medicine and you want to hear about
[55:20] something dark I it's very related to
[55:22] the food which is why it was the next
[55:25] jumping off point but it's it's dark I'm
[55:27] I'm very proud in taking no medic medic
[55:31] medications for I cannot say this word
[55:34] uh for for like I think one and a half
[55:36] or two years now and like I try to avoid
[55:38] it as as much as possible so like I'm
[55:41] really looking forward to feat medic
[55:42] what you WR could be really interesting
[55:45] um coming now closer to the end because
[55:46] we have an end routine also and we're
[55:48] already close to that one hour Mark um
[55:51] what can we learn from you besides all
[55:53] the things that we already talked about
[55:56] I think one of the big things I want
[55:58] your audience to understand is they I
[56:00] hope they buy my book Fiat food they
[56:02] don't have
[56:04] to um they don't need to buy any diet
[56:07] books people know what to eat go back
[56:10] and look at what your great great
[56:11] grandmother ate she was probably right
[56:14] you know the organs and a lot of Natural
[56:17] Foods trust yourself um you don't you
[56:20] don't need to go to experts and and
[56:24] understand that what we've been told
[56:27] about health what we've been told about
[56:29] what to
[56:30] eat it isn't science it's marketing and
[56:34] you are your audience should be
[56:36] empowered to make their own decisions
[56:38] and generally it really isn't too hard
[56:40] to figure out what's right I mean State
[56:44] you know Crisco is margarine I mean
[56:48] stuff's not even food seed oils if they
[56:52] can take the oil they're making my
[56:53] French fries with and fuel a car with it
[56:57] probably shouldn't be eating it it's
[56:59] probably it's probably a sign that
[57:00] something's gone wrong so I just hope
[57:03] your audience really kind of trusts
[57:06] themselves and re-evaluates
[57:08] their former belief if they had it in
[57:11] these credential experts because they
[57:13] have lied to us I love that line you
[57:15] should not eat the same food as your car
[57:20] right that that seems very
[57:23] logical perfect then let's come to the
[57:25] end routine where the previous guest is
[57:27] asking a question for the next guest
[57:28] without knowing who the next guest
[57:30] actually is and your question from the
[57:32] previous guest is what is unique about
[57:35] your voice about your personality um
[57:38] that's a great question what is unique
[57:40] about my voice I
[57:41] don't I think I think one thing that
[57:45] strikes me about myself and my wife
[57:46] tells me is that um I'm 46 years old I
[57:51] don't need a lot of stuff you'll
[57:54] probably any interview you see me and
[57:55] I'm probably wearing the same shirt I
[57:56] have it in a little closet there I just
[57:57] stick it on right before an interview so
[58:00] I I really don't I feel very free I
[58:04] don't really care about um I'm at a
[58:09] point in my life at 46 with four
[58:11] daughters and I've made my money I feel
[58:14] I don't need a lot of stuff where I just
[58:17] don't care about what other people
[58:19] think if I feel like something's
[58:21] important to say I I feel very
[58:23] comfortable and saying it regardless of
[58:26] the backlash and the cancelling effects
[58:28] and and all these different things so I
[58:31] I I would like to say in answer to that
[58:33] question that I feel free thank you so
[58:35] much Matthew uh for coming on the show
[58:37] and for taking the time today I also
[58:39] thank you so much for everyone watching
[58:40] and listening uh today to us uh as
[58:43] always I'll be back tomorrow with
[58:44] another episode
[58:46] bye-bye hey thanks man
