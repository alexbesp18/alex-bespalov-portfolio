[00:00] I'm all in on bitcoin Bitcoin is the
[00:01] next Bitcoin we want freedom even when
[00:03] people tell you no I don't care about
[00:05] money like that no you care cuz if
[00:07] somebody controls the money they control
[00:09] you this gives you for the first time in
[00:12] forever the chance to fight a government
[00:14] the chance to stand up for yourself can
[00:16] I pay with Bitcoin here Fiat is not for
[00:18] the middle lower class it's only for the
[00:21] upper
[00:21] class why did you start like with with
[00:24] Bitcoin in the first place like uh you
[00:26] mentioned that you me you started like
[00:28] why did you start it well it was it was
[00:30] funny because um I actually started on a
[00:33] journey of self-improvement like I
[00:35] started um I started meditating and I
[00:38] started you know being with myself and
[00:41] and seeing what I really wanted because
[00:43] it it came to a point where I wasn't
[00:45] really as happy as I thought I would be
[00:48] making it to the pros like playing pro
[00:50] basketball I'm like you know that it's
[00:53] like something was missing like I was
[00:55] like okay I made it here maybe it's cuz
[00:57] I want to go higher and play at a higher
[00:59] level you know maybe it was that but at
[01:01] the same time I'm like I'm getting paid
[01:03] to play basketball like why am I not
[01:05] just fully happy all the time and so I
[01:09] started uh on that self-improvement
[01:11] journey and uh meditation and and being
[01:15] with myself my thoughts controlling
[01:17] emotions and at one point I was like
[01:20] okay so what I want in my life okay my
[01:23] relationship with money so I started
[01:25] going into how was my relationship with
[01:27] money like I was always spending the
[01:30] money that I was getting so I was
[01:31] getting paid to spend it like to me
[01:33] money was just like a means for an
[01:36] action like if I'm going to go to the
[01:38] movies I don't care about the money I
[01:39] don't care about the 20 bucks I care
[01:41] about the time in the movie theater with
[01:43] my girlfriend watching a movie right so
[01:46] any money that I would get I would spend
[01:48] and then um I was like well I'm
[01:51] visualizing my life and the life that I
[01:53] want and I'm like okay I want to have
[01:55] money because I need money to do good
[01:57] things in the world like if I want to
[01:59] help people or like create like a good
[02:02] life for my my close relatives my
[02:04] friends my family my I don't know I if I
[02:07] want to help I got to have it I got to
[02:10] have something to help with and so um
[02:13] I'm like okay I gotta be better with
[02:15] money I got to have money now I gotta I
[02:17] got to start saving I got to start doing
[02:20] this and that and so it was funny
[02:22] because like one meditation I really
[02:24] focused on that I'm like okay I want to
[02:26] have money this this and that and then
[02:28] right after it's like it came to my
[02:30] brain I was like Bitcoin because my
[02:32] friend my I have a really good friend
[02:34] that uh worked in a Spanish exchange
[02:37] called bit to me his name is hi mayin he
[02:40] introduced me to bitcoin like years
[02:42] before but I never listened to him I
[02:44] never care I'm like there's no way
[02:46] that's going to work you know the
[02:47] government are gonna they're not going
[02:49] to let her let it happen this this and
[02:52] that and so I remember that I remember
[02:55] all those times of him telling me about
[02:57] Bitcoin and and I was like Bitcoin I got
[03:00] a call hi me and asked him about it and
[03:02] I called him we set a meeting I came
[03:05] with a pen and paper and he explained me
[03:08] everything and by by the time he was
[03:10] done my eyes were like this I was like
[03:12] there's no way all this that you're
[03:14] telling me there's no way he sent me all
[03:16] the information and then I started doing
[03:18] research and it was research and
[03:20] research and
[03:21] research on that was that was it that
[03:24] was the orange
[03:25] pill that's it's fascinating to see when
[03:28] people get orange pill that uh along the
[03:31] way they don't believe it like they they
[03:33] don't believe that it is like it is and
[03:36] and it's it's a hard hard thing to
[03:39] overcome what's also interesting for me
[03:41] is the injuries that you mentioned that
[03:43] you had four injuries because for some
[03:45] of them make sports like the recovery is
[03:47] really really um important like if you
[03:50] can come back two three weeks earlier
[03:52] then uh that you fought you came that
[03:55] it's like an really interesting part A
[03:57] really important part uh and also
[04:00] injuries can kind of cut your like some
[04:04] something happens with your leg uh that
[04:06] you cannot recover from or like it takes
[04:08] a long while or the risk is really high
[04:10] that something uh dramatic happens this
[04:13] can end the career like really quickly
[04:16] um what's your thoughts with injuries
[04:17] like this those four recoveries were
[04:19] this bad injuries or was just like weak
[04:21] or something like that uh what this what
[04:24] did this do it to you so um I my last
[04:28] year I studied university in the United
[04:30] States so my last year um the year
[04:34] before my last year I broke a finger in
[04:36] my hand and that was like the only big
[04:40] injury I had had in my whole life like
[04:43] until that point and so after that I
[04:46] finished college so I had one more year
[04:48] I finished good and when I came back my
[04:51] like my first four years were my first
[04:54] year like my my rookie year H 15 games
[04:58] in I was playing really good and um I
[05:01] landed on my leg and messed up my
[05:03] miniscus it's like the cartilage in the
[05:06] meniscus got a little broke it broke a
[05:08] little bit and so they they told me they
[05:11] were like you could get surgery or you
[05:14] could wait um strengthen don't do
[05:17] anything for two months and come back
[05:19] and so I did that I didn't get surgery I
[05:21] waited I was on the lifting all that
[05:24] came back and five games later so my
[05:27] knee was messed up like it was getting
[05:29] swallow and like I would play but
[05:31] hurting like bad and one game I broke my
[05:35] elbow like I fell on the floor and I
[05:37] broke my elbow so that was kind of like
[05:40] The Universe telling me like you got to
[05:41] stop or you're going to broke your
[05:43] you're going to break your leg cuz my
[05:44] knee was really like bad and I was
[05:46] playing through it like I was just
[05:48] playing through it and in one game I
[05:50] broke my elbow I landed I jumped for a
[05:53] block shot I landed on it and my elbow
[05:55] went forward and I broke a little piece
[05:57] of it it's not like I dislocated the the
[05:59] whole thing but I broke a little piece
[06:02] so I got to be like three four months
[06:05] with the cast and with the knee uh
[06:08] recovery so that was my first in double
[06:11] injury right and after the hand and then
[06:15] uh the year after that I signed again I
[06:17] do the recovery the whole summer
[06:19] recovering from like January to the
[06:21] summer come back and that was Co year so
[06:24] uh I was playing through my the pain on
[06:26] my elbow cuz like I I had had some
[06:29] recovery time but it was still hurting
[06:31] so bad and it was my shooting aable so
[06:33] like I got to do this every day all the
[06:35] time so it was hurting really bad so I
[06:37] was happy that K hit because I was
[06:40] hurting bad but at least I didn't get
[06:42] injured at that point and so K comes um
[06:46] I'm off the whole year and this was the
[06:49] fourth injury like the year after covid
[06:51] I start again do a really like intense
[06:55] summer uh preparation for the season and
[06:59] I'm playing really well the things are
[07:01] going good and then my knee the same
[07:03] knee that I didn't get surgery in I end
[07:06] up like messing the whole thing up the
[07:08] meniscus uh the cartilage is all the way
[07:10] broke so I have to get
[07:12] surgery and that was the surgery that
[07:17] like after the those three four years
[07:20] and I came back and and the meniscus is
[07:23] bad like it's not as bad as a a ligament
[07:27] but like the post surgery is really
[07:30] annoying cuz you can't put your foot on
[07:33] the floor for like a month and you have
[07:36] to be on the couch for a month mind you
[07:39] I work out every day like at least once
[07:42] every day I play sports like there's not
[07:44] one day where i'm like don't get me
[07:46] wrong one day but like I play sports
[07:49] almost every day so like being for a
[07:51] month not moving was really messing with
[07:54] me I'm like really stressing out and so
[07:58] that was the setting point and then
[07:59] after that I had my last surgery the
[08:02] year after on my nose cuz I broke my
[08:04] nose was I when I was a kid and I never
[08:07] I could never breathe through my nose
[08:09] until that year the my whole life like
[08:12] there was no air passing through my nose
[08:15] cuz my nose was like sideways so I got
[08:18] that last surgery I think it was two
[08:20] summers ago and uh I haven't had
[08:23] anything since so I'm doing a lot of I'm
[08:27] doing a lot cuz I never stretch before I
[08:30] never took care of my body I never ate
[08:32] healthy I never you know I I was always
[08:36] drinking soda I before self-improvement
[08:39] I was like okay I play so much sports
[08:42] that it balances the rest of the things
[08:44] you know I I can eat okay I can drink
[08:47] soda I can go to sleep late every night
[08:51] I can play video games so I I had to you
[08:53] know get right with my life cuz I'm
[08:56] really disciplined like in general I
[08:59] have a have good discipline but before I
[09:01] only had it for basketball so it was
[09:03] like I check basketball I played
[09:05] basketball today I'm good I can do
[09:07] whatever I want now it's more like
[09:09] everything else like you're there's one
[09:11] quote that it it really set it really St
[09:15] uh got stuck like with me and it was
[09:17] like you're
[09:19] you're how was it don't tell me I
[09:23] forgot you're only as good I forgot man
[09:26] I remember it come back
[09:29] it will come back and and if not you can
[09:32] tell me later then you can we can drop
[09:34] it in the comments or something like
[09:35] that um it's it's fascinating to to hear
[09:38] your story and I didn't even want to to
[09:40] interrupt you uh because it was really
[09:42] really cool uh to to to see that you
[09:45] still doing it like you had a lot of
[09:47] things coming your way and you're still
[09:49] keeping doing it I usually try to get
[09:51] from a guest like the pin post like the
[09:53] Twitter stuff like that and I think
[09:55] you're one of the rare guests that does
[09:58] not has as a pin post something with
[10:00] Bitcoin related uh so like nothing with
[10:03] with Bitcoin I think you're you like the
[10:05] first tweet that I pin on the on the yes
[10:08] exact yeah yeah it's like uh it's
[10:11] something really beautiful I have it
[10:12] here behind to others but most
[10:15] importantly be kind to yourself good
[10:17] morning uh which is really cool relates
[10:20] this to to to those stuff like that you
[10:22] are like uh still keeping going is there
[10:25] like some deeper story to that yeah yeah
[10:27] definitely um
[10:30] the whole it's it's complicated because
[10:33] I started meditating because it was like
[10:36] a like uh it would help me with my sport
[10:40] like I play better I perform better if I
[10:42] meditate I'm more focused like
[10:44] meditation is just a training of of the
[10:48] attention you you're training your
[10:50] attention right and so I got started by
[10:54] by this guy that was friends with my dad
[10:57] and and he gave me a couple books to
[10:59] read and he told me some you know tips
[11:01] but I never listened to him before I got
[11:03] injured I was like meditating is not for
[11:06] me I'm not I can't do this for I can't
[11:08] just stand there for five minutes like I
[11:10] understand when people tell me that like
[11:12] that's not for me that that was me too
[11:14] that's not for me that's what I said
[11:16] right but once I started practicing it
[11:20] just like Bitcoin he's like well I don't
[11:22] understand Bitcoin it's like have you
[11:25] actually like put in the effort like
[11:27] have you actually tried with with
[11:28] discipline for for a period of time cuz
[11:32] you're lying if you're telling me you
[11:34] you have cuz cuz cuz I'm not the smart
[11:37] as in the room definitely by far and if
[11:39] I can understand it I promise you you
[11:41] just you just have to do it and so it's
[11:44] the same with meditation it's the same
[11:46] thing and I started doing it more and
[11:47] more and and the way um and it it takes
[11:52] you deeper it's like the same Rabbit
[11:54] Hole kind of cuz like meditation the the
[11:57] translation to our language is one but
[12:00] the one that the people that Discover it
[12:03] like the yogi culture the the the
[12:06] ancient civilization type um information
[12:09] that I've that I've researched and that
[12:11] I've seen um it's like way deeper
[12:14] meditation means a lot of things it's
[12:16] not just focus on focus on your breath
[12:19] or or doing breath work or doing or not
[12:23] thinking anything it is that too but
[12:26] it's more than that but to to keep it
[12:28] simple
[12:29] is just focusing on one thing because
[12:32] when you focus on one thing you you
[12:34] leave everything out right and so you
[12:36] can only think of that one thing and
[12:39] it's it's hard because more things are
[12:41] going to come and that's the discipline
[12:42] that's the the commitment like no I I
[12:45] see you there but I'm focusing on this I
[12:47] see you there but and that's doing it
[12:50] over and over and the more you you see
[12:53] that and the more you read about it with
[12:55] many you know I read a lot of uh yogis
[12:58] that's like my favorite culture out of
[13:00] all the the the ones that I've
[13:02] researched and uh the Hindu Yogi I
[13:04] really it's just the way they speak it's
[13:06] like my my tweet was probably something
[13:09] that I was reading at that moment I just
[13:11] saw it and I and I wrote it down and
[13:13] it's like the more you you study and and
[13:15] think and see what they thought and and
[13:18] how they acted in life and the human
[13:20] being and respect for others and you
[13:23] know at the end of the day I play a
[13:25] sport right and and I go out there and I
[13:27] compete with other people and and that
[13:29] was my mentality back then it's like I'm
[13:31] competing against him like I I have to
[13:34] be better than him and kill him and be
[13:36] better cuz if not I'm not getting paid
[13:39] if I'm not better than my teammate right
[13:41] here I'm not getting in the game that
[13:43] was how that's how I thought before but
[13:45] like if you if you take from what you
[13:48] learn here and take it to sports it's
[13:49] like you don't have to compete against
[13:51] him you have to compete against you you
[13:53] have to be better than you technically
[13:55] it's not better he's him you you can be
[13:58] better than him you you're different
[14:00] than him so it does it's not it's like
[14:02] you can't compare a shark with a with a
[14:04] tiger like it's not the same category
[14:07] you're not him so you can do different
[14:09] things you you you just got to worry
[14:11] about you and and that's why I say be
[14:14] kind to others but you got to be kind to
[14:16] you because you're the only one that
[14:18] can't really control yourself you can't
[14:20] control anybody else you're not leaving
[14:22] other people's lives you're not you're
[14:23] in your movie so yeah that's probably
[14:26] where the Tweet uh came from
[14:29] really cool I it's for me fascinating
[14:31] also how many people are obsessed with
[14:33] with other people's life uh and with
[14:36] that I don't mean that they are
[14:38] empathetic to them and and trying to
[14:40] help them that's a good thing I'm saying
[14:43] they are so obsessed with other people's
[14:44] life that they like uh just uh interfere
[14:48] with them like or comparing to them like
[14:52] this is uh like focus on yourself and
[14:54] with the focus on yourself get resources
[14:57] so you can help others M it's a whole
[15:00] different thing but that's uh it's
[15:02] really beautiful yeah yeah yeah and and
[15:05] I completely agree it's like don't try
[15:08] to change and I this is another quote
[15:09] don't try try to change the world like
[15:11] change you and then that's going to
[15:13] change the world because for you
[15:15] changing you another guy another person
[15:18] is going to see and it's all energy
[15:20] they're going to feel your energy of you
[15:22] being changed and that's going to change
[15:24] them and this all energy I love it it's
[15:28] it's I think my first podcast where we
[15:31] did not read and did not speak about
[15:34] Bitcoin the first 20 minutes kind of but
[15:38] all it's still related to bitco kind I
[15:40] feel like
[15:41] uh I feel my one of my first questions
[15:45] that I would have had if we not had this
[15:47] crazy conversation even in the beginning
[15:50] uh it would be like what did you learn
[15:52] from basketball for Bitcoin and I think
[15:54] we already touched on on on some things
[15:58] uh we're focusing and the one thing uh
[16:01] canceling out the noise the noise could
[16:03] be the the out coins and and stuff like
[16:05] that uh like what what else did you
[16:08] learn from basketball that uh is is
[16:10] connected Bitcoin and maybe basketball
[16:12] basketball the the thing that I have in
[16:14] my mind and I just it's probably because
[16:16] I just listened to uh the Jack Meers uh
[16:19] like yesterday they introd Bitcoin
[16:22] speech for Atlantis Bitcoin or something
[16:25] like that and the main thing that
[16:27] compares basketball to bitcoin I think
[16:29] is baset is proof of work like you have
[16:31] to do the work like it ain't no there's
[16:33] no way you're coming out in the game and
[16:35] playing good if you haven't practiced
[16:38] like the if you haven't worked like it's
[16:41] like Bitcoin is it's the it's the hard
[16:43] money this is like it that's how I see
[16:46] it also like bit Bitcoin I see the
[16:49] discipline in Bitcoin it's like you're
[16:50] not learning it if you don't put the
[16:52] hours like you have to do it you have to
[16:55] study this is a new thing it's it's
[16:57] difficult like you have to study it you
[17:00] have to see it you have to know how it
[17:02] works you have to see why it's good like
[17:04] why is it better money than than field
[17:07] money like you have to know the economy
[17:09] you have to know where money comes from
[17:11] you have to know the the go standard and
[17:13] Nixon and all these things that changeed
[17:16] money that made money corrupt like you
[17:18] have to put the work in I I I feel like
[17:21] basketball is the same way it's like you
[17:24] have to work uh in front of nobody to
[17:27] shine in front of people like you have
[17:28] to put in the work yeah the the the
[17:32] greatest people on Earth put a lot of
[17:35] lot of work uh alone in a room uh in
[17:40] something no matter if it's like
[17:42] developing a website if it's uh training
[17:44] for sports if it's like developing
[17:47] speech like whatever it is uh to like
[17:50] Shine for like uh a few moments uh and
[17:54] everybody's like wow it looks so easy
[17:56] wow he's how it does he do it yeah of
[17:59] course how does he do it like this is
[18:02] hours and thousands of hours of of
[18:04] training and it's it's fascinating and
[18:06] also with the Bitcoin I I try to not
[18:08] speak with bitcoiners I try to not speak
[18:10] with people that did not put like an an
[18:14] hourly rate like a nice hours in Bitcoin
[18:17] in there right if they did not put like
[18:20] at least like 10 hours in Bitcoin in
[18:22] there uh it's almost not worth it to
[18:25] speak with them I try to do it still uh
[18:28] if they are actually curious about it
[18:30] and actually try to educate themselves
[18:33] but I the better thing that I try to do
[18:37] is just direct them to some resources
[18:39] because they have to do so much catchup
[18:41] it would be like for me sitting down
[18:43] with them for 10 hours to just explain
[18:45] the basics uh yeah I know exactly I'm
[18:50] I'm 100% I agree on that and um we also
[18:53] have um uh uh to talk about nutrition
[18:57] which is also interesting debates in in
[19:00] Bitcoin going on and I had guests on
[19:03] that were Wing I had guests on that only
[19:06] ate
[19:07] meat like in the
[19:09] Bitcoin I think that in the in the
[19:12] Bitcoin Community there's the this the
[19:13] only Community where a raw vegan can sit
[19:18] next to uh how how is it called the
[19:21] person that only eats meat I forgot it
[19:24] the I don't know but I I agree it's just
[19:26] the bitcoiners are so we want freedom we
[19:30] want freedom so like we're so as long as
[19:33] they don't touch our freedom it's like
[19:34] we're cool with everything I feel like
[19:37] yeah you can do you I can do me what are
[19:40] you doing for nutrition like you said
[19:42] like you you're trying to do the
[19:44] nutrition qu recovery this is a
[19:46] difficult one I I've I've done some
[19:49] research I've done some research because
[19:50] also my girlfriend has some uh micro uh
[19:53] I don't know how to say in English but
[19:55] the gut problem and so I've had to check
[19:59] that too and and all right I believe
[20:03] it's each person is different first of
[20:05] all so like something might be good for
[20:07] some people and something might be good
[20:09] for other people like we have to take
[20:11] that into consideration also depending
[20:13] or of of where where you from we have
[20:17] different like we're we're supposed to
[20:19] eat the food that is within where we're
[20:22] from right with this being said I
[20:25] believe I believe I believe you should
[20:28] eat a diet with a rich intake in protein
[20:32] which doesn't mean it has to be animal
[20:34] or plant protein like it could be both
[20:37] like I I believe at least I like to put
[20:40] both I like to mix it up as long as I'm
[20:42] taking a good protein intake I don't I
[20:45] like meat I like I like vegetable I like
[20:48] um vegetable protein so I mix it up and
[20:52] then um good amount of fats too like uh
[20:56] but of course the main thing is to to
[20:58] eat real food organic food like that's
[21:01] the the first thing and then after that
[21:04] you can pick and choose but I believe
[21:07] like I love to eat a lot of fruits
[21:09] vegetables meat fish and you know
[21:13] avocados like I I don't need that many
[21:15] carbs they're not for me just because I
[21:18] got to be lean explosive like my sport I
[21:21] got to be you know I I can be heavy I
[21:25] feel like for me personally when I eat a
[21:27] lot of carbs I get heavy so I'll rather
[21:31] be lean and explosive athletic fast I
[21:35] I'm not the tallest and I play a sport
[21:37] where a lot of people are very tall so I
[21:38] I have to be super at least as fast as I
[21:42] can be and I don't know I don't know if
[21:45] that if that answer the question of what
[21:47] I I feel like I'm still learning about
[21:49] it so I can't really act talk like an
[21:52] expert that's that's just really my view
[21:54] and my perception you know I would
[21:56] depending on what what your needs are
[21:59] what your um what are you trying to get
[22:02] like what body do you want that it
[22:04] depends right so yeah definitely and I
[22:07] think uh this is a thing that if if you
[22:10] do the basics right you're doing really
[22:12] good like don't eat processed food at
[22:17] least not too much uh try to eat raw
[22:21] things like don't eat like the the vegan
[22:25] meat from uh from the the best
[22:29] ingredients yeah the least ingredients
[22:31] that could be in food the better like
[22:33] it's got to be real food and then of
[22:35] course number one thing in food is do
[22:37] not eat sugar like processed sugar like
[22:40] fake sugar because I I got people
[22:42] telling me that you know you can't eat
[22:44] too much fruit cuz it has a lot of sugar
[22:47] like I don't believe in that for example
[22:48] like I don't believe sugar in fruit is
[22:51] bad you cannot tell me otherwise like
[22:53] you can't tell me eating Three Bananas
[22:55] is unhealthy like I don't want to hear
[22:57] that and you're having sugar with your
[23:00] coffee like that's the sugar that's bad
[23:02] not the bananas so like do not eat sugar
[23:06] bad sugar and and other than that like
[23:10] you said don't eat processed food try to
[23:12] eat as much real food as you can but
[23:15] number one main thing is drink a lot of
[23:17] water like water is so important I was
[23:20] not drinking enough water before all
[23:23] this change in my life happen water is
[23:25] so important like you got to you have to
[23:27] drink a lot of water and um the other
[23:31] number one thing that's super important
[23:32] and it's not talked about and it's
[23:34] related to health it's not food but you
[23:37] have to do breath work it's so important
[23:39] too it's like we don't understand like
[23:42] breathing is life like that's the when
[23:45] you breathe you're alive if you're not
[23:47] breathing you're not alive so like and
[23:50] it's the first thing you do when you're
[23:52] when you are born and the last one you
[23:53] do before you die it's like the most
[23:56] important thing to breathe correctly ly
[23:59] and uh I have a really good book I can
[24:01] tell you later and you can put it on the
[24:03] description or whatever there's a book
[24:05] on YouTube that you just type it it on
[24:07] YouTube and they explain the breathing
[24:10] techniques and how you should be
[24:11] breathing and a lot of techniques for
[24:14] different situation like for stress
[24:16] anxiety all these things you can
[24:17] regulate anything in the body with the
[24:21] breath that's why when Sports when any
[24:24] sport like name any sport you're about
[24:27] to do something in your sport
[24:29] you and then you go the breathing is so
[24:33] important and people forget about it and
[24:35] it's literally in my opinion more
[24:37] important than than the food and
[24:38] anything
[24:40] else yeah definitely and it's also for
[24:43] me extremely um important because when I
[24:47] uh when I speak a lot I speak as as I
[24:49] have a podcast every day and sometimes
[24:51] I'm invited to other podcasts and then I
[24:53] have also spaces on Twitter uh then also
[24:56] of course like I have have more things
[24:59] uh So speaking is so so important for me
[25:03] and when you speak you kind of sometimes
[25:05] forget about uh that you have to take a
[25:08] break that you have to to breef yourself
[25:10] also and then you're
[25:12] like so breathing is so important no
[25:15] matter what you do uh but especially
[25:17] with sports uh or when you speak a lot
[25:20] or something like that then it's gets
[25:21] even more important than that um when we
[25:25] get now to uh Bitcoin and money uh a
[25:28] little bit more um what did change when
[25:32] you have adopted Bitcoin in your money
[25:35] habit like you said before that you
[25:37] spend it a lot like you like you got
[25:39] money you spent money uh did did
[25:41] actually Bitcoin change that or just
[25:43] like the awareness that you have to take
[25:45] care of your Bitcoin I take care of your
[25:48] money B Bitcoin I mean now I do the same
[25:52] thing but instead of spending in dumb
[25:54] stuff I put it on bitcoin I have all my
[25:57] money in Bitcoin
[25:58] so like when I get paid I save a little
[26:02] bit of Fiat for like let's say right now
[26:05] I'm saving a little bit for the summer
[26:06] to spend throughout the summer but like
[26:10] the rest of the my money as soon as I
[26:12] understood this thing Bitcoin everything
[26:15] Bitcoin I don't want to have anything in
[26:16] the bank I'm really I'm really not cuz
[26:20] like when I thought about it I was like
[26:22] okay I'm definitely not having cash in
[26:24] the bank because I i' i' I stood this
[26:28] after podcast after podcast like do not
[26:31] put your money in the bank it's losing
[26:32] value inflation Anything could happen
[26:36] you know uh you're not your money's
[26:38] owner fees so I was like okay not in the
[26:41] bank and then I was like so should I buy
[26:44] a house first of all I don't have enough
[26:46] money for a house I've been playing pro
[26:48] for four years I've been injured half of
[26:50] my year my years that takes money to do
[26:53] the you know rehab like I'm not getting
[26:56] paid so I gotta you know so I didn't
[26:58] have money to buy a house to start with
[27:01] and then second of all I was like I
[27:03] don't really need a house CU I played
[27:05] basketball and they I'm moving around
[27:08] the world right now I live in Iceland
[27:09] but I I want to move and play in all the
[27:13] countries that I can so and they give me
[27:15] a house when I go so I don't really need
[27:18] a house so it'll be
[27:21] investment and I was like well it sounds
[27:24] like a lot of problems and Bitcoin
[27:27] sounds like no problems Bitcoin sounds
[27:30] like I'll just leave it there save my
[27:33] keys and this is going up forever
[27:37] so if I'm not going to use this in the
[27:40] short even medium term even if I got to
[27:43] take Som out it's going to be more than
[27:45] what I had anyways so I'll just put
[27:49] everything there and that's how it
[27:52] change for me it's just the way I see
[27:54] money and I understand money it's like
[27:58] okay I'm going to use this Fe for my
[28:00] day-to-day cuz I live in a society which
[28:03] is ruled by this way of doing things and
[28:06] for now I don't want to leave this
[28:08] Society I might go off the grid at some
[28:10] point I don't know but right now I don't
[28:11] want to and so I have to do this and so
[28:15] I'm going to try to take advantage now
[28:16] that I understand it and do things right
[28:20] but the money that I'm not going to use
[28:22] and that I'm accumulating and that I'm
[28:24] using for okay maybe I want to buy a
[28:26] house in the future or just for my
[28:27] retirement when I finish play sports and
[28:29] when I play with when I talk to my you
[28:32] know my teammates and people that play
[28:34] sports that I know it's like I ask them
[28:36] these questions now because I know
[28:37] they're not thinking about this because
[28:39] I wasn't so I'm like what where are you
[28:42] saving your money for the future what
[28:43] are you going to do when you retire what
[28:45] are you going to spend the money that
[28:46] you Sav and how much money you think
[28:49] you're going to have from the money you
[28:50] Sav because this always gets them that's
[28:52] why I start orange peing people I like
[28:55] Okay so let's say you save 100,000 and
[28:57] you play 10 more years how much money
[28:59] you think you're going to keep from that
[29:01] inflation 10% a year at least so like
[29:05] you you're losing
[29:07] $30,000 I don't I'm not doing the math
[29:09] exactly but you're losing a lot of money
[29:11] like doing this and uh that's how my
[29:15] relationship changed it's like with
[29:17] money it's like everything changed cuz
[29:20] I'm like this and what got me really
[29:23] like what really got me in is when I saw
[29:27] it as as
[29:29] the energy that it is cuz I'm going to
[29:31] work I'm going to practice I'm going to
[29:33] get treatment and I'm I'm going to do
[29:35] all these things with my body that is
[29:37] hard is disciplined and you like you
[29:39] said you see you see the athlete you see
[29:41] you saying B winning the race but you
[29:43] don't see the hard work day after day
[29:46] after day is hard I'm not saying it's
[29:48] not for me it's fun I like playing
[29:50] basketball so it's but it's still hard
[29:52] just like if you work in the podcast
[29:54] industry and doing podcast is still hard
[29:57] like even if you like
[29:58] still a job you're putting time and
[30:00] energy and you're waking up early and
[30:02] you're doing all these things and that's
[30:04] when it click when I'm okay this is all
[30:07] these hours this is my value that I gave
[30:11] to society and Society gave me back
[30:13] because people come to watch my games
[30:15] and have fun on a Friday night so I gave
[30:17] value to society with all this hard work
[30:20] it got me to this platform now I can
[30:22] perform people get value and I get value
[30:25] in return which is my paycheck or and my
[30:28] all my paychecks and I'm and and I'm
[30:31] thinking I'm like all these hours they
[30:33] are just like stealing them like they
[30:36] are just the the the central banks and
[30:39] the FED are just literally stealing
[30:41] those hours are like no you didn't do
[30:43] that that wasn't there and when I
[30:47] understood that I was like that's really
[30:49] evil like I could not see myself saving
[30:53] money in a system that operates that way
[30:56] and so and so I was like I would have
[30:59] money to use it in the dayto day and I
[31:01] have money now cuz I don't want to every
[31:04] day pay with I don't want to spend my
[31:06] Bitcoin so I keep some money to use but
[31:09] I'm hold on bitcoin like I don't
[31:12] see like Bitcoin is the next
[31:16] Bitcoin it's so interesting what you
[31:18] just mentioned with the FED because uh I
[31:21] immediately thought of the person that
[31:23] trusts the government and centr Central
[31:25] Bank the most they probably have a lot
[31:29] of Fiat laying around and not a lot of
[31:31] Investments uh maybe even only Fiat
[31:34] maybe even only euros dollars whatever
[31:37] uh and they trust the government they
[31:39] trust uh central banks and they don't
[31:43] even notice that their trust is being
[31:47] misused their trust is just yeah not not
[31:51] giving back uh because the central banks
[31:54] as you said they they're stealing from
[31:56] them purchasing power every year and
[31:59] then Joe Biden comes out and blames it
[32:02] on the big big corporations uh and this
[32:06] goes with not even Joe not only Joe
[32:08] Biden it's like all the politicians
[32:09] Canada uh they don't blame it on on
[32:13] money printing because they need the
[32:14] money printer uh and that's what makes
[32:17] me even a little bit angry sometimes
[32:20] when I see people that are struggling
[32:22] with finances they're trusting the
[32:24] governments to take care of them uh and
[32:27] then uh they have the money in the bank
[32:30] and they just see it uh devaluing every
[32:34] day and they're not thinking of Bitcoin
[32:37] and then they thinking like oh Bitcoin
[32:38] is just for rich people uh and it makes
[32:41] me a little bit sad uh but that's why
[32:43] I'm also doing the podcast that's why
[32:45] what I'm trying to do with orange
[32:46] building and what I said before which is
[32:49] interesting I usually have pretty clever
[32:52] people around me in my day-to-day life
[32:55] and they usually get Bitcoin uh so I and
[32:59] and and even if they don't get Bitcoin
[33:01] they have other Investments and they're
[33:02] doing uh uh good work and and they
[33:05] they're not they're not struggling like
[33:07] I I have a really pretty good
[33:10] environment but when whenever I meet
[33:13] someone that's actually struggling I try
[33:16] way harder to Orange build them than I
[33:18] usually do I'm like there's this Bitcoin
[33:22] if you want to learn about it come to
[33:24] me but if I really see something that's
[33:27] struggling and that could benefit from
[33:29] Bitcoin alone a lot I I DED a little bit
[33:33] harder a little bit more uh offensive on
[33:36] the on the orange billing side which is
[33:39] I think something bitcoiners should do
[33:42] just to like give back to one person
[33:44] which is also interesting because Orange
[33:46] Building is a selfless act which is not
[33:49] a lot of people think about that because
[33:51] I can orange bu a lot of people MH but I
[33:55] will not move the price like no matter
[33:57] how much orange I do I will not move the
[34:00] so I have no benefit in Orange billing
[34:02] anyone else true true I mean and it
[34:05] relates to what you were talking about
[34:07] the beginning about you know politicians
[34:09] and the stealing and all this that's
[34:12] another deep rabbit hole but it's clear
[34:14] that the people in power don't have our
[34:17] interest that's like so obvious to see
[34:19] it's not you don't have to do a lot of
[34:21] research to to realize like you all you
[34:23] have to do is go to a supermarket and
[34:25] read the back of the bags any bag like
[34:28] the first one you pick grabb a bag of
[34:30] any food and read the ingredients like
[34:32] that's not real food like that's
[34:34] chemicals that are they they don't care
[34:37] they they know it's bad they and that's
[34:39] just to name one example and but it's
[34:42] it's it's like would you say orange
[34:44] sping somebody that's why I can't now
[34:47] that's why I can't I cannot stop telling
[34:50] people about it it's like it might be
[34:53] selfless in the sense that I'm not going
[34:54] to get money for it I'm not going to get
[34:57] PRI
[34:59] you know I'm not going to get anything
[35:00] physical from it but dude it it's such a
[35:05] revolution like a silence like a silence
[35:08] Revolution it's not like we're out there
[35:10] in Pro protest or fighting governments
[35:14] or nothing like that but orange spel
[35:17] after orange spel after orange spel it
[35:19] just doubles like if I tell somebody
[35:20] about Bitcoin now it's two people
[35:23] telling other two people now it's four
[35:26] and four now it's eight now 16 it's
[35:28] exponential and just by orange spilling
[35:31] people we're just spreading the word
[35:33] like we're just changing the world
[35:35] literally just just by talking about
[35:38] this crazy invention and I don't know I
[35:42] think it's like and you said it earlier
[35:44] like Bitcoin is a lot of things it's
[35:47] it's philosophical it's spiritual
[35:50] it's it's it it's crazy to think about
[35:53] it like cuz and and I keep I keep
[35:56] learning about Bitcoin a lot every every
[35:57] day I've been in Bitcoin for three years
[36:01] like fully in Bitcoin I started learning
[36:04] about it four years ago like one year
[36:07] before that and I knew about it since
[36:10] like 2015 no joke 14 like my friend was
[36:14] telling me this when Bitcoin was worth
[36:17] one buck and stuff like
[36:19] that but you know you get Bitcoin at the
[36:22] price you
[36:23] deserve but it it like I was saying like
[36:27] it it's such a a deep uh uh thing within
[36:31] just money because money is a lot of
[36:34] things and it's different things for
[36:36] different people so you know for you
[36:38] might be one thing for my for me it
[36:39] might be a different thing but just by
[36:42] expressing this word and just by doing
[36:43] what you're doing is I respect it a lot
[36:46] I I really like it a lot that's why I
[36:47] told you I was trying to watch as many
[36:49] as I can like it's only it's only right
[36:51] that I do it and I retweet it and I send
[36:53] it to people they got to hear it and and
[36:56] they got to start doing it and they care
[36:57] they don't think they think they don't
[36:59] care but they do like it affects you
[37:01] money affects you if you live in a in a
[37:04] society like we were talking about like
[37:05] if you live in this so in a society
[37:08] money affects you so like you care about
[37:10] Bitcoin even when people tell you no I
[37:12] don't care about money like that no you
[37:15] care because if because if somebody
[37:17] controls the money they control you
[37:20] because you because you live with the
[37:22] money and this gives you for the first
[37:26] time in for forever the the the chance
[37:29] to fight a government the chance to
[37:31] stand up for yourself and and you don't
[37:34] want to hear about it you do you just
[37:36] don't know it yet but that's that's how
[37:39] I approach it and that's how you know I
[37:41] don't care my friends know it if the
[37:43] conversation comes and I got to talk
[37:45] about Bitcoin I'm talking about Bitcoin
[37:47] I told you a lot about 21 Bitcoin the
[37:49] best place for me to buy Bitcoin
[37:51] directly on a Bitcoin only exchange but
[37:54] now let's talk about how to secure your
[37:57] Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin you don't
[37:58] want to leave them on Exchange you want
[38:01] to take self custody you want to take
[38:04] responsibility of your own Bitcoin
[38:07] that's why I recommend getting a bitbox
[38:10] bitbox is an amazing wallet where you
[38:12] can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[38:15] simple way very secure you can even
[38:17] create a passphrase with that passphrase
[38:20] you can basically create a hidden wallet
[38:23] on the device itself make sure to buy
[38:27] your bit box in the link down in the
[38:29] description and with code Robin you even
[38:32] get a 5% discount that's beautiful man I
[38:35] love it uh it's like kind of the
[38:37] peaceful Revolution that uh brings
[38:39] freedom and prosperity to to humanity uh
[38:43] and uh I I just I just loved what you
[38:46] just said really really cool uh probably
[38:48] it will be in the
[38:51] trailer I love I love I like yeah I try
[38:55] to keep it fresh and try to keep the
[38:58] trailer like I think if you invest one
[39:01] hour of your life in my podcast the the
[39:03] minimum I can do is put a few seconds of
[39:07] what you can expect in the podcast in
[39:09] there I cannot get the whole thing uh
[39:13] laid out to you because I try to do a
[39:15] good job with the title and the
[39:16] thumbnail to give you an idea what the
[39:18] topic will be but as you see also now
[39:21] like we touched on so many different
[39:23] things like it's hard for me to pick one
[39:26] because I cannot list five topics on the
[39:28] thumbnail nobody will click on it uh so
[39:31] that's my my goal like pick one thing
[39:34] that was in there and then just a few
[39:37] Snippets that the guest actually said uh
[39:40] and and maybe then give you the
[39:43] confirmation okay this is the interview
[39:45] that I want to listen to or this is not
[39:47] the interview I want to listen to like
[39:49] this is like the first 30 seconds you
[39:51] can decide okay this should be
[39:53] interesting I will listen to it or I
[39:55] will not listen to it because I did not
[39:57] find anything interesting in there uh so
[40:00] that's that's that's that's really uh
[40:02] cool for me and I I also saw that you
[40:06] were in the Haring Day video from who
[40:09] was it parachutes Bitcoin I also G gave
[40:13] him some some footage it was really fun
[40:16] to watch the video um and L the the the
[40:19] having what did you for like we now like
[40:21] two days after the har run a that if if
[40:24] it comes out it will be like a week or
[40:26] two after having but uh do you do you
[40:29] think is the is the having something
[40:31] special for you or is it just like
[40:32] another day well this one was because I
[40:36] I felt like it was at least personally
[40:38] like I said like you I can only talk
[40:40] about experience but my experience was
[40:42] like it was a special day because it was
[40:44] my first actual having having having
[40:48] Bitcoin so in the having before I didn't
[40:51] have Bitcoin yet I bought Bitcoin after
[40:54] that having so um it was fun to be in
[40:59] the Twitter Community I like Twitter a
[41:00] lot uh it it it serves me you know I I
[41:04] figured I'm going to use you social
[41:07] media and like you said the algorithm is
[41:09] actually a good thing if you use it to
[41:10] your advantage so I like Twitter because
[41:13] I can watch news like like you would
[41:15] watch the news back in the but I watch
[41:18] my news in Twitter I read about what
[41:20] interested me from the people that I
[41:22] want to listen to and uh it was a lot of
[41:25] fun and the video too because uh I
[41:27] actually did uh he gave me the idea to
[41:30] to take a half court shot for the video
[41:32] and I posted it and it was special cuz I
[41:35] got quite some feedback and some really
[41:38] good connections too out of it so it was
[41:42] it was fun for me and special for me now
[41:45] within the Bitcoin life I think I think
[41:49] it's not that special because it's
[41:50] proven already that it works and it's
[41:52] not going to stop working it's worked in
[41:54] the housings before it's worked all the
[41:56] time it never misses is a it it's just
[41:58] the perfect technological solution for
[42:01] money like it so is it a special having
[42:05] we're going to have a lot more hings so
[42:07] I guess you think a birthday special do
[42:09] you think the fact that you're born in X
[42:13] day is something to celebrate I mean I
[42:17] guess but I don't know I don't I don't
[42:19] think it's within the Bitcoin live I
[42:21] don't think it's that special I think
[42:23] the special having will be the one that
[42:25] uh limits the limits the supply by less
[42:29] than one I think that would be the
[42:30] special one I think this not the next
[42:34] one the one after I think that's that
[42:36] one's going to be special I feel like I
[42:38] just have that feeling yeah the the
[42:41] thing that I found special about this uh
[42:43] having is that Bitcoin is now the rarest
[42:46] thing ever uh because the inflation rate
[42:48] is now under that of of gold officially
[42:52] now uh which is amazing I mean it was
[42:55] always we always knew it like it's not a
[42:57] surprise that's why people did not
[42:59] celebrate it a lot because like it was
[43:02] programmed to do it I feel like the the
[43:04] first Haring was probably the most
[43:06] special one I was not around I I'm like
[43:08] you I bought my first Bitcoin right
[43:10] after the Haring like few months after
[43:13] the Haring uh so basically uh for for
[43:18] the first Haring I think this is like a
[43:19] really special one on maybe the second
[43:21] one also because people was this was the
[43:23] first one like how will it work will it
[43:26] actually work
[43:28] code written from someone that we don't
[43:30] even know who it is right will will this
[43:33] this thing actually work but now we it's
[43:36] the fourth time that it worked and it
[43:38] worked perfectly uh uh so like with
[43:41] every Haring Haring get a little less
[43:44] special but there will be as you said
[43:46] along the way hars that are really
[43:48] really special but the thing that's
[43:50] special for me is also it's a start of a
[43:53] new EPO it has the the chance that
[43:56] Bitcoin is kind of like all those foure
[43:58] Cycles or this 210,000 block Cycles if
[44:03] if we are catting in the the time chain
[44:06] um is it's kind of like New Year's Eve
[44:09] like if I felt like this New Year's Eve
[44:11] kind of a feeling when I was in the
[44:13] Twitter community and in in New Year's
[44:15] Eve we we tend to think of the next year
[44:19] what what are we going to do the next
[44:21] year and it's kind of cool to have four
[44:25] times as long in the of Bitcoin we have
[44:29] like more time in this new year new for
[44:32] planation yeah and this is where this
[44:36] like this this question for for you
[44:38] comes in now um do you have some wishes
[44:41] for the next four years for Bitcoin is
[44:43] is there something you would like to see
[44:45] in Bitcoin or in your life with with
[44:48] Bitcoin first of all I just wanted to
[44:50] touch real quick and one thing you said
[44:52] and it's that and I'm copying I'm
[44:55] paraphrase paraphrasing uh Jack Myers he
[44:57] said this on this speech he said that
[44:59] Bitcoin has its own time because it
[45:02] could not trust any other's time and
[45:05] it's so mindblowing the the the whole
[45:08] time Concept in Bitcoin I I didn't know
[45:10] about it that much like I said I'm I'm
[45:12] still learning every day about Bitcoin
[45:14] so but the concept of time is actually
[45:18] crazy like I don't think nothing within
[45:20] Bitcoin is coincidence so whoever or all
[45:24] the people that did it was they were
[45:26] they knew what they were doing but do I
[45:29] have any wishes for uh for this upcoming
[45:32] four years well I want to I I I want to
[45:36] for sure get closer and closer in the
[45:38] within the Bitcoin Community I want to
[45:40] keep building relationships there uh I'm
[45:43] meeting a lot of new people are
[45:44] connecting with people all over the
[45:46] world um I'm definitely going to start
[45:49] traveling more Tov events my my schedule
[45:53] is is difficult I don't I can't plan
[45:55] ahead too much cuz
[45:57] I don't know really if I'm going to sign
[46:00] with one team or the other one or if I'm
[46:02] going to take some time off because
[46:04] whatever and maybe come back so like
[46:08] it's difficult but I'm I'm going to try
[46:10] my best I already promised one of the
[46:12] guys that contacted me out of the video
[46:14] is the swan CEO and I already promised
[46:17] him that Cory that that I was going to
[46:19] go to Pacific uh
[46:22] Bitcoin so I have to go there and but
[46:25] that's my my kind of like uh kind of
[46:28] wish wishes for this four years is just
[46:30] to get get more in in touch with all
[46:32] these people you know that that are so
[46:35] smart really like have so much to say I
[46:37] was looking to a lot of your podcast and
[46:40] people all types of people that that
[46:42] knew a lot about Bitcoin I was learning
[46:44] from everybody I really enjoyed that
[46:45] podcast with uh there was a politician
[46:47] from um I don't know if it was Austria
[46:50] or or swiss but Switzerland yeah yeah
[46:53] Switzerland and I was like man like I'm
[46:55] learning so much about Swiss politics
[46:58] right now this is this is nuts and I
[47:00] just want to you know like like I said
[47:03] uh build connections and and and and
[47:07] experiences uh around these people that
[47:10] have a selfless you know intention to to
[47:13] change the world and and to help others
[47:17] I really uh respect that and and
[47:21] yeah that's it I feel like also more and
[47:24] more athletes are doing that it's it's
[47:26] fascinating for me that more more
[47:28] athletes I think the the most recent one
[47:30] was renado moo yeah fascinating for me
[47:35] what what he's saying with AUST
[47:36] economics and and and really deep and
[47:39] and and he's really uh getting the word
[47:41] out there which is like he's not just
[47:43] like putting like one Bitcoin tweet out
[47:46] there like with like as some other
[47:48] people did he actually is talking about
[47:51] it he's going to interviews talking
[47:53] about it why do you think it's that like
[47:56] why why the
[47:57] athletes going out there and spin about
[47:59] Bitcoin they should be like I feel like
[48:02] more should be like if they understood
[48:04] what I said earlier about the how hard
[48:06] it is because I mean I understand you
[48:09] think about the top athletes right the
[48:11] top Cristiano Ronaldo LeBron James they
[48:15] don't really need Bitcoin like that to
[48:17] be honest because they are so incredibly
[48:20] Rich already like they could buy Bitcoin
[48:22] but like they could also buy 10 houses
[48:24] or 50 or I don't know I mean I would buy
[48:28] Bitcoin but like what I'm saying is that
[48:30] there are other athletes that their
[48:32] sports do not pay that good but it takes
[48:36] so much work to be good at their sport
[48:39] so like any other Olympic sports you
[48:42] know you play professional it's like I
[48:44] play professional but I don't play play
[48:45] at the highest level so anything other
[48:48] that okay NBA players they should get
[48:50] Bitcoin but especially people that don't
[48:53] make the NBA and have to go play in
[48:55] Europe and you make a lot of money but
[48:56] not that much money if you want to win
[48:59] what they are winning like if you want
[49:01] your money to get that value like if you
[49:04] want to invest that money that you've
[49:06] worked it's the same thing is what I
[49:08] tell people it's like well you people
[49:10] that make money invest right that's what
[49:13] first thing I learn people that make
[49:14] money invest so you're going to invest
[49:16] anyway so why don't you do the research
[49:18] and research this it is the best the
[49:21] best investment so like if you research
[49:23] it
[49:24] anyways I feel like athletes
[49:27] just based on like I said earlier the
[49:29] discipline that it takes to earn that
[49:31] money and the hard work and the physical
[49:33] just just imagine you're a rugby player
[49:36] it it takes a toll on the body like
[49:38] you're getting hit and hit and hit and
[49:40] you're getting paid yes but like I don't
[49:43] know like basketball is a physical sport
[49:45] too like you get paid and and it looks
[49:48] good on TV and all that but like when
[49:51] you're in the court like the the guy is
[49:53] putting his elbow on your chest and he's
[49:58] 10 kilos okay he's 610 he's 210 so like
[50:03] what I'm saying is that if you play
[50:04] sports like a fighter and you make money
[50:08] but you put so much on the line you put
[50:11] your body on the line it's not like if I
[50:15] if I don't turn in this assignment I get
[50:17] fired it's if I don't do this right I
[50:20] get beat up I get humiliated the
[50:24] competition just is strong like they
[50:26] don't care if something is hurting you
[50:28] like they're still going to go at you
[50:29] like I play a game whenever and the guy
[50:32] that's guarding me he's going at me like
[50:35] like he's trying to destroy me and
[50:37] imagine a fighter like the guy that's in
[50:39] front of you he's trying to put you to
[50:41] sleep so why the money that you get from
[50:45] that is so more it's so valuable cuz you
[50:47] put your body on the line for it so why
[50:50] wouldn't you do something smart with
[50:52] this money instead of buying a freaking
[50:54] Shane or a car
[50:57] so once sports players you know and at
[51:02] the end at the end of the days the
[51:03] education system like you can't expect
[51:06] you know at the end of the day he's a
[51:08] sports whatever he's a athlete he's not
[51:10] a economic Professor so it's on him to
[51:14] do the research it's it's it was on me
[51:16] to learn about this stuff because I
[51:18] didn't know anything about this how
[51:19] could you join the the the group if
[51:22] you're not if you don't know it exists
[51:24] right so I feel like and I know it's
[51:27] going to change but I feel like our
[51:28] education got to change like this is one
[51:30] of our biggest problems and I don't know
[51:33] how it is in all the countries all over
[51:35] the world but what I've experienced in
[51:37] Spain and in the US is like they're not
[51:40] really educating you for life they are
[51:44] teaching you so you could pass some
[51:46] exams but like you're not learning about
[51:49] how do I save my money how do I pay
[51:51] taxes how do I you know file taxes how
[51:54] do I buy a house how do I
[51:57] they cook how do I go buy groceries I
[52:01] don't know what to buy first when I was
[52:03] leaving my that's why I was eating so
[52:04] bad it's like I go to the grocery store
[52:06] and I'm like I don't know what to get
[52:08] I'm going just get whatever it's already
[52:09] made so I don't have to cook and I and
[52:12] that's bad but I don't know anything
[52:13] else I don't know how to cook anything
[52:16] so I have to learn and that's the
[52:18] self-improvement journey you you got to
[52:20] get better at a lot of things at least
[52:22] you know so you understand what world
[52:24] you live in and once you understand how
[52:27] money works it's just no other solution
[52:30] it's just nothing you could you know
[52:34] well I'mma buy some go like I you know
[52:38] Michael saor already said everything
[52:40] that I'm about to say but what am I what
[52:42] am I going to buy gold what am I going
[52:44] to buy uh silver like the Fiat system is
[52:48] broken there's nothing else to buy and
[52:51] on top of it this is the best thing ever
[52:54] created like it's so sophisticated so
[52:56] good it's not even like it's the only
[52:58] solution it's like it's the best
[53:00] solution possible cuz like we said
[53:03] earlier and it comes back everything is
[53:05] energy that's science like everything is
[53:07] energy E equals mc²
[53:10] so if you don't have a money that's
[53:13] energy too just like everything else is
[53:16] if you just have you know uh a waste of
[53:20] energy really because they just can
[53:21] print print and print and you're wasting
[53:23] energy instead of saving it and money is
[53:26] really the way to save value and you're
[53:29] just having something that loses value
[53:32] it makes no sense so once you do a
[53:34] little research that's what I recommend
[53:35] it's like I always tell people don't
[53:37] believe anything I say do your own
[53:38] research so like you just you just have
[53:41] to stop start put in the work the time
[53:43] is going to go by anyways so if you
[53:45] spend 20 minutes a day doing something
[53:47] in a year you're within the 1% that's
[53:49] the best out of it so you just have to
[53:52] be consistent with it that's the
[53:54] discipline that I think we're lacking
[53:55] and we talked about it before the the
[53:58] interview but nowadays the the attention
[54:01] span is really short and it's because we
[54:03] have a lot of distractions it's easy to
[54:05] distract yourself and grab your phone
[54:07] and start swiping up and just watch
[54:09] videos and videos and videos and put
[54:11] yourself a YouTube video and then and
[54:13] then go on Instagram and then do this
[54:15] and you don't have to be in life you
[54:17] don't have to be present in life you can
[54:19] just get by and you spend three hours
[54:22] doing nothing and you didn't even
[54:23] realize that's why the attention spans
[54:26] are so bad right now and the people that
[54:29] play sports have that that that it it
[54:33] translates because you have to focus if
[54:36] if I'm playing basketball and I'm
[54:37] thinking about what I'm going to do
[54:39] tomorrow I'm missing the shot 100% so I
[54:42] have to be just focused on the shot so
[54:44] that's why personally luckily I had a
[54:47] little bit more of attention span that's
[54:49] how I felt throughout my life like I can
[54:51] focus I can I can get this done I can
[54:54] just sit and do it I don't want to do it
[54:56] I hate to do it but I do it because
[54:59] that's that's discipline it's doing what
[55:00] you hate like you love to do it and
[55:03] that's where people gota get better at
[55:05] they like instead of you know two three
[55:08] four hours doing nothing during the day
[55:10] just have one hour doing nothing or two
[55:12] and then those other two hours it's easy
[55:14] to do something productive like I can
[55:16] just put my headphones on and listen to
[55:17] your podcast and stretch on the floor
[55:20] and I'm already doing something good for
[55:22] me I'm learning and I'm treating my body
[55:25] or I'm I'm cooking and I have the
[55:27] speaker on and I have my podcast and I
[55:30] have the podcast podcast on and I'm
[55:33] already learning and I'm getting and I'm
[55:35] eating healthy so like it's easy to make
[55:37] little changes you just have to make
[55:39] little changes throughout your day to
[55:41] build up your discipline and then and
[55:44] then that's when you can miss some days
[55:46] and be like okay today I'm going to be
[55:47] lazy because I just worked out for 20
[55:50] days straight and you can be lazy and
[55:52] you can eat okay and I can go out and
[55:54] eat something bad cuz my habits are good
[55:57] usually it's like that's what you know
[56:01] that's what we got to work on as a
[56:02] society you know coming from the
[56:04] education we got to work on building a
[56:07] little more discipline there will be a
[56:09] lot less you know mental problems if we
[56:12] just worked on it if if instead of
[56:14] avoiding that mental problem or that
[56:16] trauma that's causing it if you just sit
[56:19] with it you got to sit with things you
[56:21] gotta you know think about things you
[56:24] have to you know like I say do those and
[56:28] it comes to the meditation and the
[56:30] breathing but I feel like it's essential
[56:32] like they should teach this at school
[56:35] like meditating it it changed my life so
[56:38] drastically like to just to give you
[56:40] numbers the the season that I was
[56:42] shooting uh a bad percentage and I
[56:45] started meditating I was shooting really
[56:47] bad because my whole body was hurting I
[56:49] hadn't got uh injured yet but my whole
[56:52] body was already starting to hurt that's
[56:54] when I get injured when my knees hurting
[56:56] my my leg is hurting so I was already
[56:58] hurting and I was shooting terrible my
[57:00] worst shooting year of my life BR
[57:02] because I had a lot of um like like I
[57:05] say like I had anxiety I was nervous
[57:07] before the game never happened to me
[57:08] before I started to not like basketball
[57:10] that much I was thinking too much about
[57:12] the future like oh I should be playing
[57:13] in this league I should be playing over
[57:16] this guy I should be doing this I should
[57:18] be doing that and I was shooting around
[57:21] like less than 20% three-pointers which
[57:24] is bad like I good player like a the
[57:27] best shooter in the NBA is probably
[57:29] shooting 40% from three that's the best
[57:32] that's super good 40% is amazing 50
[57:36] insane but it's usually between 30 and
[57:38] 40 like it should be there like if
[57:41] you're close to 30 if you're close to
[57:43] 40s really good but if you're within the
[57:46] 30 40 you're good I was shooting below
[57:48] 20
[57:49] terrible the year after that I shot I
[57:52] shot like 37 out of starting to meditate
[57:56] that summer like I was just so confident
[57:58] in every shot I was not even thinking
[58:00] about the shot it's like I don't even
[58:02] care if I make it I'm enjoying shooting
[58:04] it taking the shot it's you take away
[58:07] thinking about the future and the past
[58:09] and you just worry about here and you
[58:12] train that through meditation and
[58:13] breathing work like I don't know any
[58:15] other way to train that you know and
[58:18] it's called the uh slow Flow State it's
[58:21] called Flow State when you're completely
[58:23] locked in and that's when you know you
[58:25] see the Great Performances you know uh I
[58:28] don't want to be get on basketball like
[58:30] this but Kobe going for 80 players like
[58:33] this going crazy that's flow Mo and the
[58:36] the the reason this is so effective is
[58:39] because you're so focused on the present
[58:41] you're so in the present moment that
[58:44] your mind cannot trouble and so it's
[58:48] it's attention like the attention of the
[58:50] mind when it's in the present it's 100%
[58:54] and that's when you do things that not
[58:55] even you thought you could do you make
[58:57] shots that after the game I I'll look at
[59:01] the film like how how do I make this
[59:03] I've never made this shot in my life how
[59:05] how did I come up with it in a game it's
[59:07] like that's not really you it's the
[59:09] present moment it's that's the yogis
[59:11] that's the yogis that we see that you
[59:13] can put on YouTube and and they do crazy
[59:15] stuff like being a Himalayas at minus 70
[59:18] degrees and they're wearing no clothes
[59:21] and they just sitting meditating that's
[59:23] why they are super humous cuz they're so
[59:25] in the pr
[59:26] that the mind don't control them like
[59:30] they control the mind they are one with
[59:32] the mind it's it's I mean you got to
[59:35] stop me because I could really go on and
[59:37] on about the the self-improvement uh
[59:40] Journey but any anything you want to uh
[59:43] interrupt me with or say please I I
[59:46] loved it so much I don't even want to
[59:48] interrupt you I don't even know what I
[59:51] actually asked to begin
[59:55] with think it was about uh uh athletes
[59:59] uh and and Bitcoin I went to a different
[60:03] route that's that's
[60:05] my that's to totally fine I don't know
[60:08] if you saw the episode with uh who was
[60:11] it someone was going on a 55 minute rant
[60:16] the one guy that uh you talked about it
[60:19] in one of them and I actually saved it
[60:21] to watch it and I didn't watch it I
[60:23] gotta watch it I forgot H he he wrote uh
[60:27] Bitcoin 21 million
[60:29] times he wrote no no no h he wants to
[60:33] write Bitcoin 21 million times and he
[60:36] already wrote it like 300,000 times like
[60:39] actually writing Bitcoin down uh like on
[60:43] on on on a piece of paper with
[60:47] pen and he also to write it down 21
[60:50] million times he he did the calculations
[60:52] and he's like it could work uh but he's
[60:56] not sure if it
[60:58] works that's funny that's a lot of work
[61:00] 21 million times how many pieces of
[61:04] paper uh that's uh probably a lot of
[61:07] pieces of paper he's he showed some
[61:09] pictures also with uh the the the thing
[61:12] uh the uh the when when you come come in
[61:16] there and you have the the to put in the
[61:19] I don't know how it's called in English
[61:21] that's I'm not a native English speaker
[61:23] unfortunately like when you write the
[61:25] pen you fill in the the blue things oh
[61:28] the ink the ink yes yes yes plastic
[61:31] things off the ink and you showed me
[61:33] some baskets of the inks it's like
[61:36] fascinating how many you had so that
[61:39] that was an interesting thing because it
[61:42] was not about Bitcoin really I mean you
[61:44] also talked about Bitcoin but you also
[61:46] talked a lot about discipline and
[61:48] holding through and doing crazy things
[61:50] that everybody's um thinking that's B
[61:53] like there was this one weird guy l who
[61:56] counted to 10,000 uh I don't know if you
[61:59] know him but he his name is is Mr Beast
[62:03] Rose uh and and he did crazy challenges
[62:06] and that got him famous and that how he
[62:08] basically grew to be the number one
[62:11] YouTuber right now that's uh you have to
[62:14] be disciplined about stuff I also
[62:16] believe that like like do not be afraid
[62:20] of doing something that nobody's doing
[62:22] like you just it's it's and you know I
[62:25] think relates to bitcoin too like
[62:27] Bitcoin is our like common thing like
[62:30] but as humans we all have different
[62:32] Ambitions different ways of being
[62:34] different personalities and some people
[62:36] are really attracted to doing something
[62:38] great like changing the the the Human
[62:41] Society or but some other people just
[62:44] enjoy their life you know perfecting
[62:46] their crafts like maybe an artist artist
[62:50] the best artist they don't necessarily
[62:53] paint because they want to sell the the
[62:55] most expensive painting or they just
[62:58] they just like art they just want to
[63:01] express themselves within the art and
[63:04] and and get better than themselves like
[63:07] be better than their last painting do a
[63:09] better painting than my last painting
[63:12] and and I agree with him like I agree
[63:16] that you should aim high like I aim high
[63:19] I'll play basketball professionally I'm
[63:21] not done I keep playing I want to make
[63:23] it to the NBA I want to make it to the
[63:25] ear I want to make it to the best Leakes
[63:27] and I'm going to work for it now
[63:30] whatever happens that's not up to me
[63:32] that's that's up to the journey that's
[63:35] up to the the circumstances all I can
[63:38] think about all I can really worry about
[63:40] is putting in the work is stacking the
[63:42] SATs it's stacking SATs is I see it the
[63:46] same way it's just a little bit every
[63:48] day it's do the right things every day
[63:50] it doesn't take a lot like for example I
[63:52] do 100 push-ups every day it I didn't
[63:54] start doing 100 push-ups
[63:56] but if you just do if you've never done
[63:58] push-ups in your life and you just do 20
[64:00] or 10 a day or five and you go a whole
[64:03] year of that I promise you you will see
[64:06] the difference like you will have a pi
[64:08] just by doing that don't take more than
[64:10] 10 minutes like it doesn't take me okay
[64:13] 100 takes me more than 10 minutes
[64:15] sometimes depends if I really want to
[64:17] rush it and just get it done or or I
[64:19] want to take my time and do more than a
[64:20] 100 or whatever but it doesn't take me a
[64:22] lot of time takes me 20 minutes a day
[64:24] that's not a lot but the the what makes
[64:27] the difference 20 sits a day 100 sits a
[64:30] day or 100K sits a day it's not a lot
[64:33] but if you do it all the time for five
[64:35] years for 10 years you're like you said
[64:40] you're on the top 1% you're the the top
[64:43] of the top of the class anything you do
[64:46] you want to learn a new language you do
[64:48] you learn a language 10 minutes each day
[64:52] there's no way in two years you've
[64:53] learned the language like it's the it's
[64:55] the the power of compounding and the and
[64:58] and it's the same thing as stacking sets
[65:00] as stacking sets that's I don't buy a
[65:02] lot of like now I feel like I have a
[65:05] good amount of course obviously I want
[65:07] to have more everybody wants to have
[65:09] more Bitcoin
[65:11] but I necessarily never had a lot of
[65:14] money like people that like you said
[65:16] people think you got to be rich to start
[65:18] on bitcoin like you really don't like if
[65:22] this is the solution for this type of
[65:24] people that don't have lot of money
[65:26] that's it's the and and I don't know if
[65:28] I'm going to say it correctly in in
[65:30] English but it's the biggest shift in in
[65:35] economic wealth in in human history like
[65:39] the middle lower class could shift the
[65:43] upper class if we position ourselves and
[65:45] some of us are in in in in this new
[65:49] invention quick that's that was kind of
[65:52] like the goal like make a you know um
[65:55] make something that's for everyone and
[65:57] think can everyone can enjoy and not
[65:59] only the elite cuz you know Fiat has a
[66:03] lot of perks too when you start it like
[66:05] if you have Fiat like you can go to the
[66:07] bank and get a loan and you have your
[66:10] collateral because you already have
[66:11] money and they give you a loan which you
[66:13] don't pay interest for you're already
[66:15] doubling the money in the economy so
[66:17] they already double stealing it with the
[66:19] taxes with it with all that but but if
[66:22] you have money you can take advantage of
[66:24] it now if you don't if you don't have
[66:27] 100,000 in the bank they're not going to
[66:28] give you that credit they're not going
[66:30] to give you that loan so Fiat is not for
[66:34] the for the middle lower class it's only
[66:37] for the upper class and the only way to
[66:40] shift this to change this is with
[66:43] Bitcoin just like with many other things
[66:47] it's just the solution to a lot of
[66:48] problems I hate I hate to mention it so
[66:51] sometimes when I'm around my girlfriend
[66:53] I try to you know to not mention Bitcoin
[66:56] all the time but it's just the solution
[66:58] to so many problems like I be I tell
[67:03] people I'm like okay you tell me the
[67:05] because I don't watch politics like I
[67:07] like I like Politics the concept and the
[67:10] and the ideas but the whole circus at
[67:13] least in my country and in Sp in the US
[67:16] the whole circus behind it like you
[67:18] don't know who's in charge you don't
[67:19] know it's it's all a circus to keep the
[67:21] media and keep the people entertained at
[67:24] least how that's how I view it so I I
[67:25] don't really watch politics but I tell
[67:27] them I'm like okay so you think politics
[67:30] are corrupt and they are spending your
[67:31] money in something they shouldn't well
[67:34] if Bitcoin was the the the the money
[67:38] they could not do that because it would
[67:40] be on The Ledger if they tell you they
[67:42] got to put two Bitcoins on on
[67:46] on on education or on how do you say the
[67:51] hospitals and the San that um and
[67:54] infrastructure medicine and medical
[67:57] stuff yeah if they tell you they are
[67:59] going to spend three Bitcoins you can
[68:02] see that the transfer on the leder so
[68:03] they cannot Li to you so it it ends
[68:05] corruption it's it but in it's so many
[68:08] more things so like Bitcoin is just the
[68:10] answer to a lot of questions really H
[68:13] definitely and uh I have one more
[68:16] question for for you before we get in in
[68:19] it kind of uh touches on everything that
[68:21] we touched on the last 20 minutes uh is
[68:25] that uh that we need is is like Bitcoin
[68:29] what we need for that like the my
[68:31] original question that I had for you was
[68:33] like what impact do you think Bitcoin
[68:35] will have in the world but now we
[68:37] touched on so many things that you do on
[68:39] a on an individual level with discipline
[68:42] with the proof of work with the hard
[68:44] things can this Bitcoin bring to society
[68:49] this change or is it something that
[68:51] everybody has to do on their own uh or
[68:53] is like Bitcoin as a sound money can it
[68:56] actually bring that kind of a change in
[68:59] society that people get proof of work
[69:01] and actually do the hard things and the
[69:03] low time preference things I definitely
[69:07] think it does I definitely think it does
[69:09] because the people in power right now
[69:11] they are cheaters basically they are
[69:13] stealing our money they don't have to do
[69:15] the work to be in control like when
[69:17] there's this shift and the money is
[69:19] actually hard and valuable and you can't
[69:21] just waste it on stupid stuff like
[69:24] everything is going to be analyze more
[69:27] like the people that are going to be in
[69:30] charge they're going to have let me say
[69:33] if I can let me let me see how I can say
[69:35] this it's like when the when the people
[69:38] that are in charge of how a society can
[69:40] be run and and they are messing up like
[69:43] there's nothing there's not much you can
[69:45] do like you can as an individual to to
[69:49] succeed but not not as a society like
[69:52] it's really hard to come together if we
[69:54] have a bad leader it's it's really hard
[69:56] for a basketball team to win if they
[69:58] have a bad coach even if they have the
[70:01] best players if they have a really bad
[70:03] coach I don't care what players you have
[70:05] like the coach is is important on
[70:07] managing the players same thing with the
[70:10] people on top if they're not doing a
[70:12] good job like even if we have good
[70:14] pieces we we can't Prosper as a society
[70:17] and maybe they don't want that maybe
[70:19] they only want some societies to prosper
[70:21] and they and they want to keep people
[70:22] control and the only way to control
[70:24] people is to take away their power and
[70:27] that's how this changes Bitcoin gives
[70:29] everybody back their power like now
[70:31] money is real now what I brought back
[70:34] from my value to society is real now I
[70:37] can see what I'm doing and you cannot
[70:39] just steal it away tax taxa in it and
[70:42] inflating it so I do think it it changes
[70:45] that within the world too like a new way
[70:48] and it it's funny because um I'm also
[70:51] I'm not going to say I'm super into uh
[70:54] astrology but I have studied a little
[70:56] bit L lately with my girlfriend and
[70:58] she's she's getting into it and I'm
[71:00] reading about it and we just entered a
[71:03] new era like not a couple years ago I
[71:06] forgot the exact date but we're in the
[71:08] in the era of communication and
[71:10] technology and change and I feel like
[71:15] this is what's going to lead that change
[71:17] Bitcoin it's going to change everything
[71:20] in this world within the next lot of
[71:23] years hundreds and hundreds and maybe
[71:24] thousands but we're at the beginning of
[71:27] it it's it's crazy that we're leaving
[71:28] history in first row like we're watching
[71:33] this happening as as it was created it's
[71:36] being adopted now the institutions are
[71:39] coming in now more country are coming in
[71:42] now everybody talks about it now like
[71:45] we're leaving those steps and then you
[71:47] know it would it would be crazy at one
[71:49] point when everybody realizes what we
[71:51] already see when the when the big people
[71:53] from some countries realize this and
[71:55] more and more countries started come and
[71:58] and you use Bitcoin as a regular
[72:00] day-to-day in between countries and to
[72:02] pay things and you know it's all going
[72:04] to grow a lot and I think that's going
[72:08] to be the one of the major keys to
[72:11] society's change for the better because
[72:13] communication is changing everything now
[72:15] we know that there's trust in the food
[72:17] that we eat because I have follow Five
[72:19] Guys on Instagram that every time I
[72:22] click on Instagram I see him okay we're
[72:25] going to analyze this this and this this
[72:27] is glycose sugar is this antioxid blah
[72:31] blah blah so I'm like we can learn these
[72:33] things now because of the social media
[72:35] and the communication era that we that
[72:37] we're living in before that you had to
[72:39] go to the library and try to find it and
[72:41] see if you could know about it but the
[72:45] world is already changing and Bitcoin is
[72:48] just only going to make that change that
[72:50] much faster and
[72:52] better all amazing can see uh that you
[72:57] deeply research stuff like the amount of
[73:00] information that is in your head and how
[73:01] can you how well you can articulate it
[73:04] is really really cool to see uh thank
[73:06] you for doing that and and thank you for
[73:07] being on the show but before we end it
[73:10] we actually have the end routine uh
[73:12] before that uh and you know about it
[73:14] because you watch the show like the
[73:16] previous guest is asking a question for
[73:18] the next guest without knowing who the
[73:19] next guest is and your question is what
[73:23] is the best way to bring Bitcoin forward
[73:26] besides
[73:27] education what's the best way to bring
[73:30] Bitcoin forward yes besides education
[73:33] yeah like education is an obvious one so
[73:35] that he included that one he excluded
[73:38] that one maybe I was thinking about this
[73:40] too um uh as a because I want to keep
[73:44] you know make a relationship in the
[73:46] Bitcoin community and maybe you know
[73:48] things can flourish from that I don't
[73:49] know I I I have time to uh do projects
[73:53] and work on stuff so I think stuff is
[73:55] going to come but I I was thinking
[73:58] about I think we could speed the way
[74:01] like if we went to businesses like if we
[74:03] went to like when you go to a restaurant
[74:06] or when you go to a store or when you go
[74:07] to like any place that you can buy stuff
[74:10] from if you like the place like if you
[74:12] actually go to a restaurant every Friday
[74:14] and you really like that restaurant we
[74:16] could like just um like tell the owner
[74:20] or the the guy that's running the place
[74:23] why don't you AC accept payment with
[74:25] Bitcoin like just that question that's
[74:27] not Ed educating it's more like telling
[74:31] businesses to accept Bitcoin be like you
[74:34] know if you accept the Bitcoin I would
[74:36] pay with Bitcoin sometimes maybe they
[74:39] they start accepting it more and more
[74:40] and more and that's another way of you
[74:43] know bringing Bitcoin into society is
[74:45] just see it more not even just learn
[74:47] about it it's just if you see it
[74:49] everywhere you see Visa you see PayPal
[74:51] you know what PayPal is because you see
[74:53] it everywhere it's not necessarily
[74:55] because you research PayPal but if you
[74:57] see Bitcoin all the time and then more
[74:59] people start to know about it and then
[75:01] you know I don't know I thought of that
[75:03] it's a difficult question I hope that
[75:04] one counts I don't know yeah that that's
[75:06] a that's a really good one I like it um
[75:09] Red Bull an off company had this
[75:11] strategy in the in the early days uh the
[75:15] the the boss DD mother shits uh paid
[75:18] random people in front of bars and and
[75:22] restaurants and stuff like that to ask
[75:24] the waiter for Red Bull uh like he just
[75:28] asked like hey do you have Red Bull to
[75:32] drink and the wait is like oh
[75:33] unfortunately we don't have Red Bull and
[75:36] like if you a an restaurant owner and
[75:39] there's like the the 20th guy coming in
[75:42] today that ask for Red Bull and you
[75:44] don't have it and then like uh one week
[75:47] later someone comes along and says hey
[75:50] do you want to have Red Bull in your
[75:51] restaurant and then you're uh way more
[75:54] likely to accept
[75:55] and the same thing uh gets in in a
[75:59] similar direction as you said when we
[76:01] just ask if we can pay for with Bitcoin
[76:05] in the restaurant in the bar in whatever
[76:07] like even like in in the in the
[76:09] electronic shops we can we can do it
[76:12] like what and just ask hey can I can I
[76:15] pay with Bitcoin uh and if they say no
[76:18] you're gonna like okay okay fine then do
[76:20] you also take cash or credit card that's
[76:22] like we don't have to be aggressive with
[76:24] it we just just like oh do you do you
[76:26] actually can I pay with Bitcoin here I
[76:29] actually I actually say that all the
[76:30] time and when when people I don't know I
[76:32] borrow money for people I always said
[76:34] like do you want me to pay you back in
[76:35] Bitcoin and they always say no and I'm
[76:37] like are you sure like are you are you
[76:40] sure like you might see that money in
[76:43] some months and it's going to be more
[76:45] probably they're like n it could also be
[76:47] less I'm like all right here your cash I
[76:50] wasn't send to I wasn't going to send it
[76:52] to you anyway
[76:55] that's really cool uh look I I enjoyed
