[00:00] we cannot trust humans with the global
[00:02] monetary layer so that's why Bitcoin the
[00:05] first layer is the only thing that can
[00:09] actually fix that issue how does the
[00:11] lightning network uh work in very simple
[00:14] terms uh that's what I really like about
[00:17] the lightning Network that the person
[00:19] that you're trying to cheat has an
[00:21] incentive for you to cheat him because
[00:24] the payment goes directly to
[00:26] him why will Bitcoin be the the glob
[00:30] settlement layer for everything because
[00:34] it is the only thing that it can be uh
[00:37] in my opinion the global settlement
[00:40] layer was tried uh to be the US dollar
[00:46] but uh because of the technology was not
[00:51] there yet and later on all the back
[00:55] doors uh printing money and all sorts of
[00:58] things that are friction in the whole
[01:01] system yeah and just playing corruption
[01:05] uh is just
[01:07] uh uh try to be uh but uh because of
[01:12] human behavior it cannot be and
[01:15] technologically actually it's could but
[01:17] once we invented the telegraph and the
[01:20] internet and all sorts of things
[01:22] actually it put a light that the
[01:25] corruption and all the in
[01:26] insufficiencies on The Human Side got
[01:30] corrupted faster and on a bigger SC
[01:32] scale so we cannot trust humans with the
[01:36] global monetary layer uh settlement
[01:38] layer so that's why uh Bitcoin the first
[01:42] layer is the only thing that can
[01:46] actually fix that uh issue and it's the
[01:51] only thing that can actually achieve
[01:53] this goal in my opinion yeah and it's uh
[01:57] I think it's also raises naturally like
[01:59] it's not something you have to force on
[02:01] people like nobody ever forced anybody
[02:05] on bitcoin because it's like nobody
[02:08] gains anything from forcing anything on
[02:10] bitcoin like if I orange bill my
[02:13] neighbor and my neighbor is getting with
[02:16] thousand Euros in Bitcoin Bitcoin is not
[02:19] like 20 20% more tomorrow like you don't
[02:23] have any incentive to really orange pill
[02:26] someone but still so many people do it
[02:28] and it's it's it's fascinating to see
[02:31] the the whole network grow and if we now
[02:34] go and step further maybe we will go
[02:37] deeper into the topic of lightning
[02:39] Network and how Bitcoin is a global
[02:41] settlement layer for your free articles
[02:44] with the publishing uh Solutions and the
[02:47] other three topic two topics but how is
[02:50] lightning now scaling Bitcoin uh in a
[02:54] general term for the like 8 billion
[02:57] people we are like how is lightning now
[03:00] um on top of Bitcoin important well in
[03:03] order to be this settlement layer we
[03:07] couldn't make any sacrifice on the
[03:10] security or the um or the
[03:15] decentralization and on the first layer
[03:18] we sacrifice scalability in order for
[03:22] this to be first in history
[03:25] decentralized and secure at the same
[03:27] time uh has to creates uh uh opportunity
[03:34] for people to scale and for the whole uh
[03:37] Bitcoin ecosystem to scale because we
[03:40] are 8 billion people and not only 8
[03:41] billion but uh there are so many
[03:45] inefficiencies with the Fiat systems
[03:47] that we badge so many transactions into
[03:50] one uh and the technology is now there
[03:54] that you are not going to receive a
[03:57] salary once a month or once a week
[04:00] you're going to receive streamed payment
[04:02] for every single task that you do you're
[04:05] going to uh pay between computers
[04:09] between entities let's say a robot taxi
[04:12] or something that a robot does and all
[04:15] sorts of things that are going to be
[04:17] unlocked so it has to uh we have to
[04:20] solve that scalability issue and the
[04:24] lightning network is the only thing that
[04:28] preserves uh
[04:30] very well the
[04:32] security uh of the Bitcoin layer and
[04:36] doesn't introduce thrust uh and I'm
[04:39] obviously talking about noncustodial uh
[04:42] lightning but so we can preserve that
[04:45] peer-to-peer nature because if we insert
[04:48] a custodian that means that between you
[04:51] and me to transact there's somebody else
[04:53] and we're getting into that um territory
[04:57] of the Fiat system and sooner or later
[05:00] the human behavior will will see uh we
[05:04] are so small that right now only the
[05:07] good actors uh I wouldn't say only but
[05:11] people that have the ideology sacrifice
[05:13] this technological thing and create some
[05:16] custodial solution but if they become
[05:19] big either they're going to be attacked
[05:22] from the state from hackers or from
[05:24] anywhere else or they're going to be
[05:26] corrupted themselves so
[05:30] small or big and the custodians are at
[05:33] that risk but in the non-custodial way
[05:35] the lightning network is the only viable
[05:38] solution live right now and uh in order
[05:44] to be useful uh you need just like the
[05:49] internet uh needed a lot of
[05:52] infrastructure to be made and right now
[05:54] to have this call I have no idea what
[05:58] has to happen in order for me directly
[06:01] to uh buy my own Hardware to connect to
[06:04] the internet to be my own internet
[06:07] service provider but I pay a small
[06:11] monthly fee to an internet service
[06:13] provider on my side and you on your s
[06:16] and now we are connected on this podcast
[06:18] but uh this same approach is what Breeze
[06:23] actually coin the term lightning service
[06:26] provider where uh there's specialized
[06:30] entity a company where it figures out
[06:33] all that complexity for us and it just
[06:36] gives me a simple app where I'm using
[06:39] the lightning network but I don't have
[06:41] to deal with all that complexity I just
[06:44] have the noncustodial uh nature but the
[06:48] being online dealing with the hardware
[06:50] dealing with the protocol and all sorts
[06:52] of things that I have no idea what's
[06:55] behind somebody else specializes and
[06:59] every time time that I make a payment
[07:01] they take the routing fees they don't
[07:03] come to me because I'm not I don't have
[07:07] the uh
[07:08] node uh I'm not the node operator but
[07:13] the node operator is the lightning
[07:15] service provider so when I I make a
[07:17] payment uh that small fee goes to them
[07:20] and that is kind of the approach and
[07:22] I'll stop here because I can talk a lot
[07:24] it's good I think and um maybe for
[07:27] people that are new to the space or even
[07:30] to for people that are along in the
[07:31] space and maybe want an really simple uh
[07:35] way to explain for other people the
[07:38] lightning Network maybe you can give us
[07:39] like a really short introduction how
[07:42] does the lightning network uh work in
[07:44] very simple terms for the new people
[07:47] that are I think there's always in every
[07:50] Bitcoin podcast in every Bitcoin article
[07:54] there's someone uh that just discovered
[07:57] Bitcoin in there and I always try to
[08:00] keep my podcast really simple terms and
[08:03] uh for them to not go get overwhelmed
[08:06] like maybe can you give like a short a
[08:08] simple introduction to the lightning
[08:10] Network in
[08:11] general yes uh I would assume that the
[08:16] person understands the onchain
[08:18] transaction but from that premise and
[08:21] the lightning Network it's uh it is
[08:25] between peers again let's say I have uh
[08:28] on chain wallet and you have onchain
[08:31] wallet and we uh both of us together say
[08:35] we're going to transact often between us
[08:38] so let us both create a multi- separate
[08:42] wallet where I say I'm going to connect
[08:45] to you
[08:46] directly uh and I'm going to put let's
[08:50] say 1 million Sates on my end of the
[08:54] channel uh so because I'm going to pay
[08:57] you let's say ,000 Satoshi every other
[09:01] day or something I'm going to make a lot
[09:03] of transactions when we set up that
[09:06] channel um between us we uh can actually
[09:11] um we don't pay any fees uh on the on
[09:14] chain uh wallets you have to pay the
[09:18] mining fees and you have to have that uh
[09:21] waiting period for the next block to be
[09:23] found but when we set up that channel
[09:26] between us now we uh we don't pay any
[09:30] fees between us to go back and
[09:33] forward uh and it settles
[09:37] instantly so why is it thrust list
[09:41] because if I try to let's say I open a
[09:44] Channel with one million sets I send you
[09:47] half a million sets and I say I'm going
[09:49] to close the channel That is full on my
[09:52] side because it is an address that both
[09:55] of us control you can see that I cheated
[09:59] so if you catch me that I
[10:01] cheated I am not only going to you're
[10:04] not only going to get the fire uh half a
[10:07] million says that you're technically old
[10:10] but you can take all the funds that were
[10:13] in that channel so if I cheat I'm not
[10:17] only punished but uh that's what I
[10:20] really like about the lightning Network
[10:22] that the person that you're trying to
[10:25] cheat has uh an incentive for you to
[10:28] cheat him because the payment goes
[10:30] directly to him and this is completely
[10:33] inversed in the Fiat system thinking
[10:36] because if you cheat there and even if
[10:39] you're caught a lot of the times big
[10:41] deal uh maybe you pay some fine but you
[10:45] printed so much money to yourself or
[10:48] whatever so whatever uh but now that if
[10:53] you cheat you're not only going to pay
[10:56] what the other person is owed but the f
[10:59] M goes directly to them uh that's why it
[11:02] is trustless network and that is the
[11:05] simple thing between a channel between
[11:08] us now to abstract it away what I talked
[11:12] about lightning service provider we are
[11:15] no technical people so imagine that
[11:18] right now we don't have a channel
[11:20] between us but I'm connected to some
[11:23] company that let's say I open a channel
[11:26] to them and more accurately they open a
[11:29] channel for me and also they open a
[11:32] channel to you so when I want to send a
[11:35] payment to you that means that that
[11:38] payment is going to go through both of
[11:40] those channels and because it's going
[11:43] through that uh lightning service
[11:45] provider they take let's say one satosi
[11:48] fee or 10 satosi fee whatever but that
[11:52] is kind of the dynamic uh it scales I
[11:56] would say slowly because it's uh
[11:59] very technical thing you have to be
[12:01] really an expert lightning is not for
[12:04] amateurs but the lightning experts with
[12:07] these lightning service providers are
[12:10] introducing new Solutions so we can use
[12:12] it in this non-custodial matter manner
[12:16] uh and it's I think the the next two
[12:19] years will be a lot about
[12:22] lightning I also think so and uh are you
[12:26] suggesting that we like as a bitco and
[12:29] now and you understand Bitcoin you have
[12:31] Sal custody you run your own node you do
[12:33] everything uh as bitcoiner should do is
[12:37] the next step now running a lightning
[12:39] node uh playing around with lightning on
[12:42] a non uh non-custodial way like what's
[12:45] what's the next step for Bitcoin is it
[12:47] running a lightning node should that
[12:49] every should everyone run a lightning
[12:51] node yeah absolutely not uh if uh you
[12:57] decide to run a lightning node
[12:59] even when I started working at Bree I
[13:02] thought that I need to run a lightning
[13:04] node to understand and to do my job
[13:06] better but the devs told me like
[13:10] lightning is not for amateurs you have
[13:12] to have the technical capability you
[13:15] have to be interested and there are a
[13:17] lot of things think about this you have
[13:20] to become a lightning operator it's not
[13:22] that uh you have some type of address
[13:26] and the computer takes care of it uh
[13:28] itself
[13:29] there are so many things that come into
[13:32] becoming this lightning operator and it
[13:34] never
[13:35] sleeps uh all the time 247
[13:39] 365 uh so yes you have the incentive to
[13:43] do that because just like I explained if
[13:47] uh you start to be a very good operator
[13:51] you're going to earn by people going
[13:54] through your noes but if you're just
[13:58] trying to to double uh here and there uh
[14:02] I it's not going to be worth that amount
[14:06] of effort and that amount of energy to
[14:09] go into this and uh let's say um you go
[14:13] do your regular job and you pay the
[14:17] 0.1% fee for every payment even less uh
[14:22] to somebody that is going to take care
[14:24] of all the security being online uh all
[14:27] the time upgrading when it's needed with
[14:30] all the features all that complexity is
[14:33] going to be um U dealt by the experts by
[14:37] the lighting service providers and you
[14:39] and me we're are going to work what we
[14:41] are experts at and we are going to
[14:44] transact between us and pay those small
[14:46] fees if if you decide to go to this this
[14:51] is the opportunity cost uh is it worth
[14:54] really digging into becoming an
[14:57] lightning expert and earning this way or
[15:01] is it worth you being an expert in
[15:03] something else and you uh pay for those
[15:06] fees in the lightning Network yeah it's
[15:10] basically that's the the whole premise
[15:12] um like Bitcoin is a savings account
[15:16] everybody should use but if you really
[15:19] want to like there's all this notion
[15:21] yeah you can trade it you can do stuff
[15:23] with it you can run a lightning node and
[15:25] it's completely two different things uh
[15:28] but uh if if you really want to do
[15:29] something with your Bitcoin as like
[15:31] lightning node running it's more like a
[15:34] business also Bitcoin mining like it's
[15:36] there's a lot to Bitcoin mining that you
[15:39] have to consider uh before you start it
[15:42] like it's it's not as buying Bitcoin
[15:44] it's it's it gets from the savings side
[15:46] to an investment uh or even like an
[15:49] entrepreneural uh side and I imagined as
[15:53] I'm not an lightning expert but I
[15:55] imagine it's the same with lightning
[15:57] operators with lightning uh node Runners
[15:59] when I hear you enter a you enter a very
[16:04] uh big competition uh just like the
[16:06] maining operators now it's not only that
[16:10] you have to be very efficient but you
[16:13] have you are competing against everybody
[16:16] else globally and that is the same in
[16:19] the lighning network yes you can set up
[16:22] and that's why it's not for amateurs
[16:24] because if you just want to understand
[16:26] how it works and let's
[16:29] say spend uh few hundred dollar just for
[16:33] understanding okay but that is getting
[16:36] the knowledge but to actually operate it
[16:39] uh that is the consideration it's not
[16:42] worth it because if you're average
[16:44] you're going to be priced out just like
[16:47] the mining companies are doing what's
[16:49] the um like as for Bitcoin mining you
[16:54] have an advantage if you have a big
[16:55] facility you have an advantage if you
[16:58] have cheap electricity uh if you can
[17:00] have like a solar roof where it's always
[17:03] sunny if you have wine turbin where it's
[17:06] always when when like this if you have a
[17:08] cheap electricity and a big facility you
[17:11] have an advantage over other people
[17:14] what's the advantage of having like is
[17:16] it just knowledge that you need for
[17:19] lightning operators like or is there any
[17:21] other advantage to I I would say the uh
[17:25] it's not only knowledge and it's moving
[17:28] Target
[17:28] uh the first thing is that you because
[17:33] the lightning protocol even though it is
[17:35] uh 5 years it it is still being
[17:38] developed uh and you have to be uh
[17:43] connected really good to the network
[17:45] because nobody wants to make a payment
[17:48] through you and it fails 50% of the time
[17:52] so uh on the technological side you have
[17:55] to listen to where the payment is
[17:58] actually going to get through uh you
[18:01] have to understand about servers you
[18:03] have to understand about protocol and
[18:06] it's a lot of things and it is a moving
[18:09] Target so if but the very very good
[18:14] thing is because it's an open-source
[18:17] thing that if somebody makes a
[18:19] breakthrough in the lightning
[18:21] network uh everybody benefits uh for
[18:25] example we just published in Twitter
[18:29] that uh we made a non-custodial offline
[18:34] payment uh and right now because breed
[18:37] solved it everybody else can see our
[18:40] code and can implement it in their
[18:43] application so even though we are
[18:45] competing against each other all of us
[18:49] benefit when any of us uh make a
[18:53] breakthrough in the whole ecosystem
[18:55] because we want that second layer to be
[18:58] very very reliable we don't want to have
[19:01] even 5% failed payments we want to just
[19:06] work yeah that's that's a Target and and
[19:09] if we want Bitcoin to succeed as a
[19:11] global settle settlement layer as the
[19:14] global unit of account Global medium of
[19:16] exchange we need uh layer Solutions and
[19:20] uh there are two more questions to the
[19:22] lightning Network the first question for
[19:24] me is like can there be another layer to
[19:28] ution that is maybe out growing in the
[19:31] future lightning and then other question
[19:34] is like how many layers or are there
[19:37] layers that will be developed on top of
[19:39] lightning and if so how many layers can
[19:42] there be on on light on the layer two
[19:45] can there be maybe like 10 layers uh of
[19:49] of of Bitcoin before like there's like
[19:51] the the guy who orders like a Starbucks
[19:54] coffee he orders it on layer five with
[19:57] his like 70 uh
[20:00] Sates uh and the banks or like big
[20:03] institutional investors they operate on
[20:06] layer one or two like how will it work
[20:09] in the future the layers and will there
[20:11] be competition to the lightning Network
[20:13] I I would say just like in the mining uh
[20:16] in the lightning Network the competition
[20:18] is going to be even uh bigger uh because
[20:23] even now we are probably 1% Global
[20:27] adoption even Less in uh the Bitcoin
[20:31] ecosystem and out of that
[20:33] 1% uh people that really understand
[20:37] lightning Network let's say is one1 of
[20:39] that uh those are rough estimations on
[20:43] my side but uh I don't think uh it will
[20:49] be a lot of layers above this it's the
[20:53] third layer can be the application uh
[20:57] because let's say say that we are users
[20:59] in one application that can be solved
[21:02] for example just in the user experience
[21:05] uh what needs to be settled between us
[21:08] and for example uh you can use the
[21:12] second layer to send one satosi away but
[21:15] if the application layer uh just figures
[21:19] out okay uh Ivan needs to send uh Robin
[21:24] of once DOI every second it just going
[21:28] to start counting and at the end of the
[21:31] that streaming satosi is going to create
[21:33] just one invoice and it's going to make
[21:35] one payment uh that's just one solution
[21:39] there are other ways but I don't think a
[21:42] lot of other layers need to be uh above
[21:46] the lightning or anything else and my
[21:49] personal opinion is that I don't think
[21:53] uh something else will out compete the
[21:56] lighning network but but definitely
[21:59] there will be other Solutions mitigating
[22:02] some stuff but right now how the
[22:05] development is going uh lightning is the
[22:09] fastest horse and uh it's on a very good
[22:13] trajectory yeah I also think so like you
[22:16] hear a lot about lightning Network and I
[22:19] think one year ago there was some uh bus
[22:22] around another Network I actually forgot
[22:24] the name about it uh but uh I don't hear
[22:29] anything about another really good
[22:31] working life solution other than
[22:34] lightning and it will become with each
[22:38] year that Lightning goes on and Bitcoin
[22:40] goes on it will be harder to compete
[22:42] with lightning like the same thing we
[22:44] had basically with Bitcoin and like
[22:46] right right now we're in the point I
[22:48] think where Bitcoin is not uh
[22:50] destroyable where Bitcoin is not uh it
[22:53] cannot be overtaken by another
[22:55] decentralized Network that's the Sim
[22:57] like it's almost impossible I would put
[23:00] it as like a
[23:02] 99.999% security there and the same is
[23:06] happening with lightning it's younger
[23:08] than Bitcoin it's on top of Bitcoin uh
[23:11] it's uh subject to more competition I
[23:14] think in the future uh but with every
[23:17] day it lives on and with every uh user
[23:20] that develops on the the every user that
[23:23] spend with lightning it will get harder
[23:25] and harder to to to beat the network
[23:28] effects of of lightning absolutely and I
[23:32] even think that uh maybe not this cycle
[23:35] but the next cyle for certain we are
[23:38] going to have people come into Bitcoin
[23:41] and not even touch the first layer uh so
[23:44] the network effect in the lightning
[23:46] network is going to grow a lot more
[23:49] stronger because even the businesses uh
[23:53] for example let's say the ATMs that are
[23:56] on chain only
[23:59] they're going to be priced out in a few
[24:01] Cycles what you can buy from an ATM so
[24:04] if they don't implement the lightning
[24:07] Network or something that is much faster
[24:10] they're going to be out competed in the
[24:12] first layer as a business so even the
[24:15] businesses right now are incentivized to
[24:18] um to give something that is cheap and
[24:21] fast because of the mining fees and the
[24:24] only really working solution right now
[24:27] is the lightning Network so obviously
[24:30] they're going to go there and when the
[24:32] businesses Implement those solutions
[24:34] they will invite a lot of new users and
[24:37] as I said there are going to be people
[24:39] more and more that have no idea about
[24:42] the first layer Dynamics I'm super
[24:45] excited to announce that this podcast
[24:48] just got the first ever sponsor I just
[24:52] started the podcast out like three
[24:53] months ago and now we have 21 Bitcoin as
[24:57] a partner for this podcast 21 Bitcoin is
[25:02] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[25:05] and preach self custody this is my goto
[25:09] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[25:12] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[25:15] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[25:19] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[25:21] support this podcast use code Robin and
[25:25] click the link in the description yeah
[25:27] Especial
[25:28] um like when you look at really poor
[25:32] countries that uh stack really a small
[25:35] amount of satosi every week and for them
[25:40] just to go onto the main layer with the
[25:43] transaction transactions and they need
[25:46] maybe to spend their Bitcoin because
[25:47] they don't have any other options like
[25:49] we always say like oh don't sell your
[25:51] Bitcoin but there is someone that has no
[25:53] other options to to sell than your
[25:56] Bitcoin and then transactions fee on uh
[25:59] the main layer basically force you to be
[26:02] on the the second layer uh which is I
[26:06] think a good thing because it drives
[26:08] Innovation uh and also big fees on the
[26:11] main layer means that we have a a bigger
[26:15] security budget for the Bitcoin miners
[26:17] which secures the whole network more
[26:19] like at least I think like that um and I
[26:24] mean as as as we get into the whole
[26:27] instant Global uh settlement layer um
[26:31] maybe before we get all in the Articles
[26:33] also how did you find your way in
[26:37] Bitcoin and what's motivating you so
[26:41] much to make your your life also about
[26:44] Bitcoin because you're working in
[26:46] Bitcoin in the as a a Bitcoin company
[26:49] and the Brie uh what what's what's
[26:52] motivating you to do all that I would
[26:54] say that my personal story is I I
[26:59] realized on a very deep emotional level
[27:03] the problems in the Fiat system and I
[27:05] was
[27:06] predisposed uh to look for Solutions
[27:10] there and the only solution was uh
[27:12] Bitcoin and we're not going to get into
[27:17] that uh whole thing but I would say this
[27:20] my mother was killed because of money
[27:23] and the only solution that uh
[27:28] could have helped that uh situation is
[27:32] that if her assets were in Bitcoin and
[27:36] when I saw that and when you know that
[27:40] there was a solution for that
[27:43] situation uh it is extremely emotional
[27:48] for me uh and I was put in that position
[27:51] to understand it this deeply but uh
[27:55] other people will have will not do the
[27:58] work to understand it why Bitcoin is the
[28:01] only solution and uh so many people um I
[28:07] would
[28:09] say ne they're never going to want to
[28:14] understand something like this they have
[28:16] the problems that they have they they're
[28:18] searching solutions for their own
[28:20] personal problems but because of this
[28:23] emotional thing that happened in my life
[28:25] and every that uh occurred after that
[28:31] how to get the money that me and my
[28:34] sister are all to inherit with the
[28:37] inheritance problems with the law with
[28:40] people uh stealing from us even after
[28:44] this tragedy when you're very low at
[28:47] your low point of your life all those
[28:50] problems I was trying to deal with them
[28:53] uh I failed at some stuff I succeeded
[28:57] everywhere and uh my lady uh invested
[29:02] some money in ethereum and she was
[29:04] chasing me for more than a year uh let's
[29:08] make money about this and because I knew
[29:11] that it was associated with scaming and
[29:14] it wanted to stay away but at some point
[29:17] in the boom Market uh I just capitulated
[29:20] and said I'm going to prove that this is
[29:23] a total scam and in span of three uh
[29:28] days I found out yes I'm absolutely
[29:31] right about crypto but this goddamn
[29:34] Bitcoin thing I can't find the hole how
[29:37] it's coming some group of people and uh
[29:41] in three days I found out that Bitcoin
[29:44] is different but in 10 days let's say I
[29:48] started to grasp this uh whole network
[29:52] the whole incentives how it is set up
[29:56] and uh became more and more a Believer
[29:59] and at the point where I heard uh Jason
[30:02] Larry's thesis about power projection
[30:05] and I connected that with my own case I
[30:09] said this is it I don't care uh what
[30:13] other people think uh this is the only
[30:16] solution for the people that it really
[30:19] really matters and then I D really deep
[30:23] into it and I said I must contribute
[30:27] it's not that I want to because I
[30:29] understand it on that deep level and a
[30:33] little bit of look uh landed me the
[30:36] position in Breeze but I started doing
[30:39] stuff for Bitcoin anything that I could
[30:42] contribute and I became this evangelist
[30:46] for other people to understand it in a
[30:49] deep level and at some point uh when you
[30:53] get on the mission and not the
[30:55] money you get lucky because you're not
[30:59] going to get out of track uh going to be
[31:03] distracted by money because ethically I
[31:06] know exactly what I'm fighting for uh I
[31:10] just found the company that is a really
[31:12] good fit with uh that mission and then I
[31:16] wanted to contribute to as much as I can
[31:20] and even now even though I'm working
[31:22] with Breeze I am not stopping uh because
[31:27] I have 9 to5 job or something I started
[31:31] a Bitcoin Meetup in my city because
[31:34] nobody was doing it uh I inspir other
[31:37] people to make seminars I contribute to
[31:39] other seminars I orange Bui all my
[31:42] relatives uh so yeah when you're on the
[31:45] mission you're going to contribute and
[31:47] the community and the whole ecosystem is
[31:49] going to get back at you but if you're
[31:52] in it for the money uh there will be
[31:56] times where you're basically
[31:59] because uh money fluctuates the mission
[32:04] doesn't yeah it's that that is so true
[32:07] because uh I mean I started my talking
[32:12] about money Journey four years ago uh in
[32:16] around
[32:17] 2020 uh around that time actually and I
[32:21] started talking about Bitcoin
[32:24] in yeah also 20 20 but more like 2021
[32:29] because I needed a year to go from my
[32:31] stocks to actually Bitcoin only um and I
[32:37] just went on Twitter and rambled about
[32:41] what I do I do did do do now the podcast
[32:44] also and uh till January this year I did
[32:48] not made a single Euro uh from anything
[32:52] and I did it for like over a year I did
[32:54] more than 50 tweets a day uh because
[32:57] because I was just uh discussing with
[32:59] everybody that wrote me back as no
[33:02] matter if it was a good comment or bad
[33:04] comment because I had the mission and
[33:06] not uh the money like I spent so such a
[33:10] immense amount of time on it and I work
[33:14] next to it in sales and it's an
[33:16] interesting contrast because in sales
[33:17] you have the agenda to make money like
[33:20] that's that's basically your job if you
[33:22] don't make money you're just not doing
[33:24] your job uh and uh made a quite good uh
[33:28] income with that and with Bitcoin I made
[33:30] no income at all like with Bitcoin with
[33:33] with uh talking about Bitcoin and it
[33:36] just fueled me with so much energy uh
[33:39] doing that and it's it's a great journey
[33:42] to be on so I I can fully understand
[33:44] where where you're coming from and the
[33:45] journey and I I congratulation for for
[33:48] stepping into the Bitcoin only world and
[33:50] also
[33:51] being in in the chob world in Bitcoin
[33:54] that's a it's amazing step to be in um
[33:57] and you also wrote three articles about
[33:59] that instant settlement in with with the
[34:02] lightning Network and what we touched on
[34:05] before uh and I think it was published
[34:08] in the Bitcoin magazine uh and maybe
[34:11] somewhere else
[34:13] if also um and those three articles are
[34:18] basically how instant settlements in the
[34:21] lightning Network and the construction
[34:24] industry in the logistic industry and
[34:26] the in the publish
[34:27] industry uh will disrupt
[34:30] things um maybe before we go into each
[34:34] industry what's the overall uh premise
[34:37] the overall conclusion about about that
[34:40] how will it disrupt the world
[34:43] basically yeah uh because I was a
[34:48] manager in a lot of Industries in my
[34:51] feia
[34:52] jobs and I was responsible for a lot of
[34:55] people uh in some of them but I
[34:59] recognized a very big problem and uh I
[35:03] didn't know the root cuse I just
[35:05] recognized the problem that uh the
[35:10] employees uh actually figure out in the
[35:12] first month maybe two what is the
[35:15] minimum amount of work that they need to
[35:18] do so that they don't get fired so
[35:20] basically they figured
[35:23] out to do as little as possible for long
[35:27] as possible uh but on the other side the
[35:30] employers and the managers people that
[35:33] are rewarded for
[35:35] performance uh actually want to squeeze
[35:39] the most out of those same workers and
[35:41] that's a direct conflict one wants to do
[35:44] as little as possible for the most
[35:46] amount of money and the other wants to
[35:49] pay the least amount of money for the
[35:51] most amount of work and I recognize that
[35:53] problem 15 maybe 20 years ago
[35:57] something like that and I realized that
[36:01] in order to motivate the people uh I
[36:05] don't I don't uh I have to figure out
[36:09] other ways than money because if I give
[36:11] them purpose if I give them bonding with
[36:13] the team experiences that motivates them
[36:16] but I still didn't realize what was the
[36:19] root cause and once I started working at
[36:22] Breeze and figuring out this fast inance
[36:27] instant settlement glob even though the
[36:29] lightning network is not going to serve
[36:32] 8 billion people uh but it will be on
[36:35] the trajectory for this instant
[36:38] settlement something that we never had
[36:40] before I recognize that this is actually
[36:43] the problem because people are not paid
[36:48] those same workers people are not paid
[36:50] for work they are paid for the time that
[36:54] they're in the store that they in the
[36:56] the company and if you're paid for your
[37:00] time your personal incentive is exactly
[37:05] what happens to most of them how do I do
[37:08] nothing and receive money so in order to
[37:11] have 100% profit you need to be paid for
[37:15] time and do nothing your payment is
[37:19] actually the work done the energy that
[37:21] you spend so if you don't spend any
[37:23] energy the money that you receive is
[37:25] 100%
[37:27] and now understand all those problems
[37:30] that I faced in the FIA job and it just
[37:34] uh the labor force are not stupid
[37:37] they're just pulled through that
[37:40] incentive uh and I recognize if we have
[37:43] instant settlement payments that are
[37:46] paying for not time but for tasks and
[37:50] for things that have to be achieved now
[37:53] the company the managers and the labor
[37:57] force are going to be completely aligned
[38:00] uh because we are paid for kind of the
[38:03] same thing but different people are
[38:05] doing different parts of it uh and this
[38:09] was the very big uh breakthrough uh
[38:13] realizing that that was the root cause
[38:15] and obviously in the articles I dig into
[38:19] the uh the other very big uh paradigm
[38:23] shift is that now we have split payments
[38:26] uh because the labor force are doing the
[38:29] work but the company is taking most of
[38:32] the profits a lot of the times now uh
[38:36] that we are not only allign to do the
[38:40] same thing but everybody can be split
[38:42] paid for anything so let's say I'm a
[38:45] Salesman in a store and I'm not paid for
[38:49] time but I'm paid for what I sell if I
[38:53] sell let's say something for 100 pounds
[38:57] uh and I know that I make uh 5%
[39:00] commission 10% 20 it doesn't matter the
[39:02] percentage but I negotiate with the
[39:04] company what is my percentage the person
[39:07] that is paying for let's say uh a pair
[39:10] of shoes I'm going to receive five% of
[39:13] that then the next one is uh suit I'm
[39:16] going to receive instantly me on the one
[39:19] side the company on the other the uh
[39:22] manager this site or how many ever uh
[39:25] splits you want to take so that is the
[39:29] nature of that whole series and the
[39:31] first three articles are out but three
[39:33] more are going to come out in the next
[39:35] weeks oh that's that's interesting
[39:37] because I I thought like as I went
[39:40] through the
[39:41] Articles this looking at an industry is
[39:45] basically uh you can put it any industry
[39:48] right it's like just you can look in a
[39:51] specific industry but basically you can
[39:53] have the whole concept in all the
[39:55] industry
[39:57] and maybe for like maybe let's dive into
[40:00] the publishing industry first because
[40:02] it's like the the closest uh to most
[40:05] people because they're consuming right
[40:07] now something that is published uh like
[40:10] a podcast how can this disrupt podcasts
[40:14] offers of books uh social media in
[40:16] general uh like mainstream TV maybe even
[40:20] I don't like how how disruptive will
[40:22] will that be and how will how fast maybe
[40:25] also can that
[40:27] uh change happen yeah I would say that
[40:29] if we're looking at the podcast industry
[40:32] the solutions are already out completely
[40:36] out uh because as a podcaster you can
[40:41] publish that podcast in podcasting 2.0
[40:44] you connect you can connect your
[40:47] lightning wallet to that and everybody
[40:49] that wants can send uh satosi to the
[40:52] podcast via streaming or via boost if
[40:55] you're
[40:57] uh let's say three people involved in
[41:00] the production of the podcast you can
[41:02] split those payments that you know let's
[41:04] say 50% goes to the business itself 25%
[41:08] to the host 25% to the editor or
[41:12] whatever You' like to split that
[41:14] technology is already available you just
[41:17] need to figure it out and use it and I
[41:21] apply that uh same thinking as the
[41:23] podcast to the publishing industry now
[41:26] imagine that somebody uh publishes a
[41:30] book they have to negotiate with a
[41:32] publishing uh house uh what they uh what
[41:38] they need as a signing bonus or anything
[41:41] else what the publishing house is going
[41:43] to do what they are going to do when
[41:44] they're going to deliver all sorts of
[41:46] complicated things for something that
[41:49] will happen in the future and I'm saying
[41:51] okay now let's uh completely ignore the
[41:56] feat type of thinking and let's use this
[41:59] instant settlement technology uh most
[42:03] efficiently now I am an author I'm
[42:05] writing a book and the moment that I
[42:08] have the manuscript ready I can
[42:11] self-publish it and I receive 100% of
[42:14] the sales directly to my lightning
[42:16] wallet or because I don't want to be a
[42:19] marketer I go to a publishing house and
[42:22] we negotiate the split between us so
[42:25] every single copy of the book that is
[42:27] sold the author receives their split
[42:30] payment and the Publishing House receive
[42:32] the other payment now that the book is
[42:35] out somebody else needs to translate it
[42:37] into another language uh so uh the
[42:41] original book is split in two ways uh
[42:44] but the the second language is going to
[42:47] be uh split in three ways it's going to
[42:50] be between the translator the author and
[42:54] the Publishing House uh then I take it a
[42:57] step further if you make an audio book
[43:00] the same manuscript uh the audio book
[43:04] needs a narrator a producer a sound
[43:07] engineer so it's a complete project on
[43:09] its own but again you can split the
[43:11] payment however you like for each
[43:13] individual copy of the book or each
[43:16] individual copy of the audio book and
[43:18] that thing is a that technology is
[43:21] available now what I'm trying to focus
[43:24] in the articles is that some somebody
[43:26] needs to create that app because the
[43:29] technology is out now you don't need to
[43:32] be a lightning expert uh how to split
[43:34] payments all sorts of things yeah you
[43:37] need to understand some uh programming
[43:40] because you need to create the
[43:41] application itself but uh you're a
[43:44] developer you just develop an app and
[43:47] you contact somebody like breeze or
[43:50] another company that is building
[43:52] infrastructure and you say Okay I want
[43:54] to receive payments and setting up
[43:56] wallets or even use already uh solutions
[44:00] that are already out and the last thing
[44:04] is uh in the publishing article
[44:07] publishing books is
[44:09] that now you don't even have to go to a
[44:13] publishing house because uh you can
[44:17] actually
[44:18] self-publish but you go to influencers
[44:21] and you don't tell them promote this
[44:24] book and I'm going to give you a
[44:27] discount what they do with every
[44:29] influencer right now oh buy this product
[44:33] or this service and you're going to
[44:35] receive whatever discount uh and the
[44:38] user experience is kind of okay but uh
[44:42] with the lightning Network it's going to
[44:43] be the influencer is going to say buy
[44:47] this book uh May yeah there is no
[44:51] discount but every single sale of that
[44:54] book uh the influencer is going to
[44:57] receive their share of the split payment
[45:01] and now you're not every author is not
[45:05] going to be blocked by publishing houses
[45:07] what has to be out and uh they're not
[45:10] blocked by their marketing skills they
[45:13] just create something of value of some
[45:16] type of information they publish it and
[45:19] they approach um people that can promote
[45:22] it and say if you sell it through your
[45:25] website your platform or whatever you're
[45:28] going to receive this share for every
[45:30] single individual copy it's not going to
[45:33] be uh I'm going to sell it just like the
[45:36] publishing houses now uh they receive
[45:39] the payment and at some point they they
[45:41] pay some royalties now go check if the
[45:44] sales are correct go check if they're
[45:47] not officiating some numbers uh the
[45:51] verification is very hard but with
[45:54] instance settlement you don't need to
[45:56] verify anything every single payment is
[46:00] a purchase uh for and it's a income for
[46:04] everybody that contributed to that
[46:05] project being built in the publishing
[46:08] industry I would say here I would stop
[46:12] yeah I think uh and now it makes a lot
[46:16] more sense uh how lightning actually can
[46:19] be used and disrupt the world because a
[46:22] lot of people say oh Bitcoin is just
[46:24] money and I basically agree with that
[46:26] but uh Bitcoin is digital and sound
[46:30] money like we have digital money already
[46:33] and we have sound money already but this
[46:35] brings Bitcoin brings those worlds
[46:37] together and this uh enables so many
[46:41] amazing use cases uh and we can
[46:44] basically go through every industry
[46:47] right now and give examples how this uh
[46:49] will go uh but I think it will it will
[46:53] make like a 10hour podcast out of it uh
[46:57] and so but I think now the the point is
[47:01] made how Bitcoin and the lightning net
[47:03] better um maybe for the everyday blab
[47:07] out there how what should we like
[47:10] obviously you work at PRI uh but what
[47:13] should we um uh consider when we
[47:18] choosing uh liening tools no matter if
[47:21] it's like for yourself to pay stuff or
[47:24] to set up stuff uh for payments uh maybe
[47:28] even like how should I start like if I
[47:30] have an app idea for like something like
[47:33] a split payment in my industry uh where
[47:36] should I go who should I contact like
[47:38] how how can I get involved in in the
[47:40] whole thing I would say uh first uh
[47:43] thing uh that you have to realize uh
[47:46] that is completely opposite than the
[47:49] Fiat system is that the person that is
[47:52] paying is paying for the fees because
[47:55] because in the Fiat system if you go to
[47:57] a store uh you pay what they ask and the
[48:02] fee we are still paying it as users but
[48:05] it's hidden it's actually the fee to the
[48:08] banks to the payment processors are
[48:10] actually extracted away from the company
[48:13] that is getting that payment so when you
[48:17] send a payment or when you open a
[48:19] channel and you send that fee that also
[48:22] applies to the uh first layer of Bitcoin
[48:25] the person that is sending the payment
[48:28] is actually paying for that fee and when
[48:30] people say oh I pay that fee so I lost
[48:34] let's say 2,000 satoshis they think that
[48:37] they lost it no you're paying for a
[48:39] service to send that money somewhere uh
[48:43] so that is a big paradigm shift and from
[48:46] this I would say invest some amount of
[48:51] money intentionally to uh to make
[48:56] every single type of payment as the user
[48:59] to understand what's the difference
[49:01] between custodial lightning and
[49:03] noncustodial lightning was the
[49:05] difference between opening channels uh
[49:08] there are different Technologies of
[49:11] sending the actual payments and just say
[49:14] I'm going to uh not be frustrated
[49:16] because I want to say let's say buy a
[49:19] book or pay for this podcast and I'm
[49:22] charged some amount of Satoshi and I'm
[49:24] losing uh on this transaction but say
[49:27] I'm going to intentionally payments that
[49:30] are kind of fake just so I understand
[49:33] the Dynamics and when you understand the
[49:35] Dynamics for what you're paying when the
[49:38] fees are High when they are low how can
[49:41] you navigate that system in different uh
[49:45] times uh now you're ready to actually go
[49:49] and use the proper tool uh for the
[49:52] proper time for the proper situation uh
[49:56] but if you don't go through that
[49:58] learning uh maybe you're going to open a
[50:01] channel exactly when the um when the
[50:05] mining fees on the first layer are uh
[50:08] very high but if you understand the
[50:10] Dynamics and now that the fees are lower
[50:13] you can say okay I'm going to open
[50:15] channels as a user now and then I'm
[50:18] going to use it and I would say this if
[50:22] you want to uh understand lighning
[50:26] lightning is for payment uh for
[50:29] especially for the First World countries
[50:31] for the third world where they can save
[50:35] minuscule amount of satosi maybe a
[50:38] custodial solution is better suited for
[50:40] them until they're ready uh to uh go
[50:45] into noncustodial and then to go on the
[50:47] first layer but that Dynamic just
[50:51] understand the Dynamics first so you
[50:53] know what to do when just like you don't
[50:56] uh start driving a car before you
[50:58] understand first shift second shift
[51:01] mirrors everything else and you need to
[51:04] invest that energy the energy in the
[51:06] payment system uh is just the money uh
[51:10] it I would say it's not a lot but if you
[51:14] feel that you robbed 10% because of fee
[51:18] the feeling is uh what drives the how
[51:23] you're going to feel about the
[51:24] application but if you say oh I'm going
[51:27] to invest $10 $20 for fees for me to
[51:32] understand now you will understand
[51:34] everything else much better and your
[51:36] experience will benefit a lot more yeah
[51:40] I think that's uh that's greater twice
[51:42] for for uh in general life if you if you
[51:45] want to learn something you have to
[51:47] experience it go deep on it like I also
[51:50] learned Bitcoin like that I just bought
[51:53] some Bitcoin I transferred it to a
[51:54] hardware wallet I did that in the first
[51:56] week where I knew about Bitcoin because
[51:59] I just wanted to experience the whole
[52:00] Bitcoin ecosystem as as as much as I can
[52:04] and I also like transferred it back from
[52:06] my Hardware wallet to my exchange to
[52:09] from my exchange to my bank account
[52:11] again like I did the whole thing just to
[52:13] make sure I understand it and I can deal
[52:16] with it and if once you understand it
[52:18] and you put your money in and and and
[52:21] put some investments in then you have a
[52:24] an easier time to understand the whole
[52:26] thing and and how it's working and we
[52:28] having an end routine at the podcast
[52:31] where like the previous guest asked a
[52:32] question for the for the next guest and
[52:35] it's an interesting question for you
[52:36] because especially we're going into this
[52:40] whole Bitcoin standard world uh when we
[52:43] talking everybody is uh on on a Bitcoin
[52:47] standard and paying with lightning and
[52:50] everything is is like that on that
[52:53] premise how will Bitcoin influence
[52:55] culture what will change on a on a
[52:57] Bitcoin Bitcoin standard to society I
[53:00] would say this is exactly the question
[53:02] that I'm addressing in the Articles even
[53:05] though it's instant settlement but why I
[53:08] was fascinated uh um just like I said I
[53:12] recognize the problem because of Mi not
[53:15] I wouldn't even say it misaligned
[53:17] incentives but completely opposite
[53:20] incentives between the labor force and
[53:22] the company owners and I would say that
[53:26] when we go into hyperbitcoinization
[53:28] because we're going to align incentives
[53:32] now we're pointed in the right direction
[53:35] and now we're Going Back To Nature
[53:38] because when um when we were very small
[53:42] tribes we didn't have uh money even
[53:46] invented but we exchanged energy uh we
[53:50] exchanged things that we specialized in
[53:54] we did and let's say we are going to
[53:56] hunt a elephant or a mammoth or whatever
[54:00] we uh had to
[54:02] coordinate who does what exactly so we
[54:05] can achieve that project and the there
[54:08] was nobody that was paid to say stay
[54:12] here and we are going to pay you uh some
[54:15] amount of meat because you did nothing
[54:18] you either did something or you were out
[54:20] of the village and because we're going
[54:23] to that fundament nature what made us
[54:26] humans to organize really really well
[54:30] the tool is the instant settlement thing
[54:33] that I'm saying the lightning network is
[54:36] the uh solution right now but even the
[54:39] third layers and the fourth layers are
[54:41] going to chase that instance settlement
[54:44] and it will Spring not only that we are
[54:47] pointed in One Direction but all that
[54:50] coordination between all of us it's
[54:53] going to give us such a huge deflation
[54:57] because just like I said if you're paid
[55:00] to do as little
[55:04] uh as little as possible now imagine
[55:08] that all those people are incentivized
[55:11] to do as much as possible what is going
[55:14] to happen to the price uh of everything
[55:17] now the neighbor is going to help you
[55:20] out is going to clean let's say the
[55:22] allei in front of the building or
[55:25] something because he's incentivized all
[55:28] of that but this will happen on a global
[55:31] scale which I'm very very excited and I
[55:34] would say uh I can't wait honestly
[55:39] because I saw that the instant
[55:41] settlement is the root cause of the
[55:43] problem the instant settlement I'm sorry
[55:45] is the solution for that root cause of
[55:48] misaligned incentive and the
[55:50] coordination between people will be
[55:52] awesome totally um
[55:55] I think your insights and and your uh
[55:59] way of thinking of Bitcoin is really
[56:01] cool and also really unique uh there are
[56:04] some some bites in there that I marked
[56:08] uh uh that I never heard before I'm
[56:10] really looking forward to publishing
[56:11] this one and also like having all the
[56:14] clips uh from from that podcast I'm
[56:16] really looking forward to that and for
[56:18] people uh wanting to find you want
[56:21] wanting to get in touch with you where
[56:23] can people find you the best I'm almost
[56:25] everywhere I'm one of the two most
[56:28] visible people in breeze so in Twitter
[56:31] I'm naku 2000 and a c KO o o 2000 and
[56:36] I'm also in noer I'm in LinkedIn
[56:40] whatever suits your both I'm very easy
[56:43] to reach out if you're a bitcoiner that
[56:45] means that you're a orange brother or a
[56:48] sister so you're always
