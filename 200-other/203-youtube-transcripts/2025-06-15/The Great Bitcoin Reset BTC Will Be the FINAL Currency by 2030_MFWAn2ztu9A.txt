[00:00] having Trump as president is a highly
[00:01] positive change for Bitcoin in 2030
[00:03] you're going to have to make a choice
[00:05] and the population is going to have to
[00:06] choose between a cbdc which has a
[00:09] plethora of privacy concerns Freedom
[00:11] issues slave to the state problems or a
[00:14] decentralized version of that which is
[00:16] Bitcoin I don't think people can sit out
[00:17] of this this Choice it's going to have
[00:19] to be one or the other and I think at
[00:20] the end of the day Bitcoin is going to
[00:22] win we're on the right side of History
[00:23] we may be the next Bitcoin and we may
[00:24] have an even bigger return then you
[00:26] spend time researching Bitcoin and you
[00:28] understand it doesn't matter cuz it was
[00:29] the first it's going to be the last you
[00:31] know that's the it's the only true
[00:32] intrinsic valuable cryptocurrency there
[00:34] is Fiat which is government money is
[00:36] basically the money of War Bitcoin at
[00:37] the end of the day is the best tool that
[00:39] we have and I would certainly be worried
[00:41] for Humanity if it were to fail we're
[00:42] going to pay some of our $35 trillion
[00:45] debts by holding Bitcoin the objective
[00:47] with Bitcoin is to become a faster form
[00:49] of money and that means that the
[00:51] throughput has to
[00:53] [Music]
[00:57] increase what are your first thoughts
[00:59] about uh the
[01:00] election oh man yeah I mean first
[01:03] thoughts Bitcoin for the win hearing
[01:05] that Trump might might have a reserve
[01:08] for Bitcoin specifically is is a really
[01:10] exciting prospect you know it's the
[01:12] first Bitcoin elected president so yeah
[01:15] let's see let's see what happens over
[01:17] the next few months what do you think is
[01:19] the the impact of that actually now for
[01:21] Bitcoin we we already heard a lot of
[01:24] like okay this will happen this will
[01:26] happen and now it's actually here now
[01:28] Trump is actually uh president and that
[01:30] by also a lot like it was not not close
[01:34] in in the end as I saw it um H how how
[01:39] big is that for for Bitcoin or does it
[01:42] just impact short-term price
[01:44] volatility yeah it remains to be seen uh
[01:47] there's this debate I think that I've
[01:48] been having with some Bitcoin friends
[01:50] for a while now which is to say would
[01:53] this movement where we have a president
[01:56] that is pro
[01:57] Bitcoin that would inevitably lead to
[02:00] more people becoming more aware about
[02:02] Bitcoin because the price increases
[02:03] would that actually help longterm or
[02:06] would something which doesn't sound
[02:07] particularly good but would something
[02:09] like the further degradation of society
[02:11] actually help accelerate adoption so you
[02:14] know it's it's a toss up um obviously I
[02:16] would prefer the the the former you know
[02:20] like I I would like to maintain a
[02:23] reasonable quality of life I want the
[02:25] people I love to be safe all these
[02:26] things uh but yes I I think that in the
[02:29] short term
[02:30] having Trump as president is a highly
[02:32] positive change for Bitcoin for sure and
[02:35] and I thing um
[02:37] we whether the B like if there's like a
[02:40] clear candidate that is better for the
[02:41] country versus a clear candidate that is
[02:43] worse for the country I think we want
[02:45] the candidate that is better for the
[02:46] country like I have no clue about us
[02:49] politics so I don't even want to do the
[02:51] Judgment who's better uh but uh if we
[02:54] assume Trump is way better for the
[02:56] country what uh this is the thing that I
[02:59] hear from all my Bitcoin American
[03:01] friends um then we want him because both
[03:04] will print
[03:06] money yeah yeah he added what was it
[03:08] seven 7 trillion to the debt uh when he
[03:10] was in office so you know regardless on
[03:13] who candidate whichever candidate you
[03:15] choose at the end of the day the state
[03:16] is going to continue to print money and
[03:18] and it's going to be a a debasement of
[03:20] of our currency but in like I said the
[03:23] short term it's it's great to see this
[03:25] price action um I do think that one of
[03:30] the most positive things that could
[03:32] potentially come out of this change in
[03:33] leadership is RFK and what he's going to
[03:35] be doing to to to America as a whole you
[03:38] know this guy is he was the one I wanted
[03:41] at the end of the day um but you know we
[03:44] get him through proxy essentially
[03:46] because he's going to be put in charge
[03:47] of all these Health agencies and and
[03:48] trying to fix the the chronic disease in
[03:50] America um one of the things that he
[03:52] says is when he was his uncle as
[03:54] president um so JFK when he was
[03:56] president chronic disease in America was
[03:57] 6% to now it's 60%
[04:00] so we have to do some drastic changes
[04:02] around just General Health Food
[04:05] qualities all these things and I think
[04:07] that that that mission is definitely
[04:08] something that a lot of bitcoiners have
[04:10] got behind so that's what brought me
[04:11] along for the ride with Trump I would
[04:13] say is the strong indication that
[04:15] they're going to fix the chronic disease
[04:17] they are going to hopefully break apart
[04:19] the state you know uh with musk saying
[04:21] that he's going to cut the the the
[04:23] number of government employees by 75% I
[04:26] mean these things are potentially
[04:27] life-changing and drastic absolutely it
[04:30] could make America extremely attractive
[04:33] again like to to move there to be there
[04:36] and you um also moved from UK to Texas
[04:40] if if I understood that correct I did
[04:42] yeah the
[04:43] things going on in the UK around 2020
[04:46] was
[04:47] was yeah not not that great you know um
[04:50] that was to come through to my orange
[04:52] pill story it was probably the point
[04:55] that I
[04:56] reached when I would yeah I lost faith
[05:00] in the state I mean that's the simplest
[05:01] way to say it you know before then I I
[05:03] had faith that the government was doing
[05:05] things in my best interest and um that
[05:08] they were telling us the truth the media
[05:10] was behind telling to to be providing
[05:12] truthful information which all of that
[05:14] is is definitely false now you know um
[05:17] and I I made the tough call to come over
[05:21] here um it was going to be Florida or
[05:23] Texas at the end of the day and Texas is
[05:25] where the guns are it's where the
[05:26] freedom is and it's Bitcoin City it's
[05:28] Bitcoin Central you know
[05:30] amazing how did uh this change of
[05:33] environment this change of uh completely
[05:36] different uh environment all of a sudden
[05:38] change your perspective on on on freedom
[05:41] did it further enhance something or like
[05:43] how did you look at that I think I've
[05:45] always been a bit of a
[05:48] um combative personality I would say to
[05:51] Authority you know it in school teachers
[05:53] used to hate me um I don't know I'm just
[05:56] very anti anti-authority and and the
[05:58] before coming to the umbrella term of
[06:02] libertarian which is what I am I didn't
[06:04] really know how to place myself
[06:07] politically and 2020 was that breaking
[06:09] point when I realized I am a Libertarian
[06:11] I think Freedom
[06:13] privacy above all else at the end of the
[06:16] day um you know and America it still
[06:18] stands as as a testament to the best of
[06:21] humanity when it comes to um
[06:24] anti-establishment anti- totalitarianism
[06:26] and and it is an experiment at the end
[06:28] of the day you know democracy what we're
[06:30] doing here and I hope that we're going
[06:32] to see it through and we're going to see
[06:33] a rebuild uh but yes I think for me
[06:36] moving here was a a protest around the
[06:40] things that were happening in the UK due
[06:41] to covid-19 which at the end of the day
[06:43] was yes in some ways horrible
[06:47] unanimously for Humanity you know a lot
[06:49] of people did die but they were we won't
[06:51] have to go into that but yeah it
[06:53] freedoms the freedoms that were taken
[06:55] away alongside of of the the health
[06:58] actions were terrible to see in my
[07:01] opinion and I think in 2020 a lot of
[07:04] people changed something in their lives
[07:07] like when I talk with people uh and it
[07:10] comes to either they moved or they got
[07:13] into Bitcoin both their events for a lot
[07:15] of people that happened in in in 2020 or
[07:18] around that time uh like a year later
[07:21] half a year later some also a little bit
[07:23] before that but usually it's like around
[07:25] that Co area uh which is really
[07:27] interesting last thing on the election
[07:29] that uh
[07:30] I want to cover is is the the nation
[07:32] state game theory which is super
[07:35] interesting for me like we have those
[07:37] bricks countries we have the Euro Zone
[07:40] then we have um then we have America and
[07:44] America is now probably the first major
[07:49] country that actually puts Bitcoin uh as
[07:53] the defined strategic reserve on there
[07:55] which could be something really
[07:58] drastically changed
[08:00] um H H how impactful do you think is
[08:04] that yeah it's actually a shame to see
[08:07] the adoption still not being at the
[08:10] stage where we're we're viewing multiple
[08:12] countries you know adopting Bitcoin as
[08:14] as their um Reserve currency it's a good
[08:16] sign to see El Salvador Breaking the
[08:18] Barrier you know and I think recently we
[08:21] saw Argentina's VP vice president
[08:24] meeting with El Salvador's president
[08:26] belli and that is a really good sign
[08:28] because that could potentially paved the
[08:30] way for more countries to adopt Bitcoin
[08:31] so the the conversations I'm sure are
[08:33] happening and now that we have Trump in
[08:34] the White House you can't really avoid
[08:38] the conversation anymore you know um and
[08:40] I think I come I always come back to to
[08:43] this debate and this point with people I
[08:46] know which is the march to
[08:50] authoritarianism is going to happen you
[08:53] know and I think in 2030 or around then
[08:55] we're going to have to make a choice and
[08:57] the population is going to have to
[08:58] choose between a cbdc so a central bank
[09:01] digital currency which has a plethora of
[09:05] privacy concerns Freedom issues uh slave
[09:08] to the state problems or a decentralized
[09:11] version of that which is Bitcoin you
[09:13] know and I I don't think people can sit
[09:14] out of this this Choice it's going to
[09:16] have to be one or the other and I think
[09:18] at the end of the day Bitcoin is going
[09:20] to win we're on the right side of
[09:21] history but it may mean that we're going
[09:22] to have to see a little bit of of
[09:24] society crumbling in the meantime is
[09:26] there any uh situation where you all uh
[09:29] where we could imagine that Bitcoin
[09:31] isn't winning and cbdcs and that kind of
[09:34] future I mean it's scary but uh do you
[09:37] think that is even
[09:38] possible yeah I mean we don't we don't
[09:40] really know at the end of the day I mean
[09:42] there are sort of three main
[09:43] possibilities one is that Bitcoin fails
[09:45] I don't think it's likely I think if it
[09:47] was going to fail it would have done
[09:48] already um but that's a possibility even
[09:51] if it's slim two is that the dollar
[09:54] Still Remains The Reserve currency of
[09:56] the world and and we see really Bitcoin
[09:58] as more of like a settlement l and and a
[10:00] more of a savings technology that people
[10:02] choose to store their time and energy in
[10:04] and then three is what I'm hopeful for
[10:06] is that it actually Bitcoin becomes the
[10:08] reserve currency of the world and it
[10:10] swallows up all other assets and this
[10:12] this is gamechanging for Humanity I
[10:15] would say um but yeah who who really
[10:17] knows uh at the end of the day builders
[10:19] in this space all we can do is just
[10:21] really look ahead a few years ahead and
[10:22] just hope that that we're going to build
[10:24] some further and exciting things on on
[10:27] bitcoin lightning is great there's
[10:29] developments there to be made I I still
[10:31] don't think we're quite ready for Mass
[10:32] adoption there um yes we've increased
[10:35] throughput and and payments uh the
[10:38] number of payments throughput is
[10:40] increased but it still fails quite a few
[10:42] times um I don't know what your
[10:43] experience with lightning is like but
[10:44] you know behind the scenes I think it
[10:45] fails a whole bunch of times like double
[10:47] figures before it actually succeeds a
[10:49] payment so we're still there yeah yeah
[10:53] wasn't wasn't aware that it's that high
[10:55] that's that's like uh so big but yeah my
[11:00] experience with with lightning uh I
[11:02] don't use it too much like I have here
[11:04] and there some some some event where we
[11:07] can pay with Bitcoin or something like
[11:08] that but that's quite uh rare that's
[11:12] like maybe once or twice a month maybe
[11:14] three times a month if I'm uh I mean if
[11:17] I'm on a Bitcoin conference then it's
[11:19] like at the conference a lot of times uh
[11:22] like you buy for coffee or something
[11:23] like that but it's really rarely and and
[11:26] there I just use wallet of Satoshi uh
[11:29] might get some hate for that but uh it's
[11:31] it just works like it's it's it's not
[11:34] self custody but uh I have maybe 50 EUR
[11:38] on there maybe 100 EUR on there if they
[11:42] steal my wallet it's okay for me yeah I
[11:45] don't care about that too much yeah I
[11:47] have no bad blood with wallets of
[11:49] Satoshi that was the first lightning
[11:50] wallet that I used we can't use it
[11:52] anymore in America it's banned so you
[11:53] can't even download it from the App
[11:54] Stores which is frustrating uh but we
[11:57] need more of these tools you know I I I
[11:59] think that there is no
[12:02] better justification for Bitcoin and and
[12:05] no better way to orange pill someone or
[12:07] sell sell someone on bitcoin than
[12:09] actually loading up a lightning
[12:12] wallet taking them by the hand to a
[12:14] restaurant that accepts Bitcoin payments
[12:16] and scanning aligning invoice and
[12:19] watching them see as their eyes light up
[12:21] that a payment has gone through in this
[12:23] currency that is apparently magic
[12:25] internet money so yeah that was we have
[12:28] a few places in Austin in here where
[12:29] where I live that accept Bitcoin and
[12:31] yeah it it feels pretty nice to actually
[12:33] transact with Bitcoin in hand and buy
[12:36] pizza for example it's really cool it's
[12:38] it's an amazing feeling I love it a lot
[12:40] we also have that in in in Vienna um
[12:43] that's an interesting question though
[12:44] when when we look at like the main phase
[12:47] that we are currently in is the St value
[12:49] phase and most people uh adopt it
[12:52] because they want to store the wealth in
[12:54] Bitcoin how important a wall is that
[12:58] Medium Exchange
[12:59] side of things I mean for like the price
[13:02] appreciation my theory always was um we
[13:05] only need uh the the the store of Val uh
[13:09] store of value side of things uh because
[13:11] you don't even want to do you you don't
[13:14] even want that Bitcoin is moving too
[13:16] much if it stays in one place it's
[13:17] actually better for the price but I had
[13:21] Larry leart on the show and there was
[13:23] some other people uh that that said the
[13:26] same thing to me is like the medium
[13:28] exchange uh story is super important for
[13:31] the adoption of of Bitcoin how how do
[13:34] you see
[13:35] that yes and I think it's the entry
[13:37] point you know as as people see their
[13:39] currency debasing and they see inflation
[13:41] at record highs they can't afford
[13:42] groceries they can't afford a house you
[13:44] need somewhere to park your savings
[13:46] because at the end of the day money is
[13:47] just your time and energy it's a way to
[13:50] redeem goods and services in the future
[13:52] and so because money printing
[13:54] essentially debases devalues your
[13:56] currency over time it leaks value you
[13:58] need to wait to
[13:59] securely store money um and that's
[14:02] that's really I would say the primary
[14:05] value for me with Bitcoin is this a way
[14:07] for me to park my time and energy but
[14:10] yes I think once we reach Mass adoption
[14:15] um you know I would say that that we're
[14:17] at an interesting point in history now
[14:19] where we've sort of migrated away
[14:21] from the early adopters the Pioneers who
[14:24] are maybe the cipher punks the the
[14:26] crypto evangelists and we're sort of
[14:28] slowly coming on that bell curve of
[14:30] adoption and it's becoming a little
[14:32] steeper and now the challenge really for
[14:34] Bitcoin exchanges and other companies is
[14:37] to educate people the mass public on
[14:41] what Bitcoin actually is and how it's
[14:42] valuable the strategy that is no longer
[14:45] in play is you can't just throw people
[14:47] in front of a smash bu button and just
[14:49] hope they're going to purchase because
[14:50] it's not really going to be the case
[14:52] anymore so you saw that with um Swan
[14:55] they launched their their free one hour
[14:57] Bitcoin 101 uh course online you have
[15:00] cash app who launched bread which is a
[15:02] written uh with graphics and and and uh
[15:06] text book on bitcoin education so you're
[15:08] starting to see these big exchanges
[15:10] actually moving to more of a strategy of
[15:12] education and that's really where I
[15:14] think that that the value is for the
[15:16] future um that's what JP is going to be
[15:17] about too we want to educate the masses
[15:20] um because you know the
[15:23] switch that's going to be valuable for
[15:25] Humanity is to realize that Bitcoin
[15:27] isn't just a store of value but it
[15:28] actually is money and you can transact
[15:30] with it so that's going to be an
[15:32] interesting switch when people realize
[15:34] they can actually buy stuff with Bitcoin
[15:36] absolutely yeah and and you mentioned it
[15:38] some a question I should have already
[15:40] asked that uh earlier what are you doing
[15:43] and and what is uh
[15:45] chipsy yeah so jippy is uh it's the the
[15:48] the world's first Pokemon go inspired
[15:51] Bitcoin education game so we're building
[15:53] bit Bitcoin education for the masses and
[15:55] that happens to be through the lens of
[15:57] Pokémon go we're really excited uh we
[15:59] launched our MVP earlier in the year and
[16:02] that really just brought in structured
[16:04] education so we have islands of tiered
[16:07] education about Bitcoin combined with
[16:10] SATs so once you actually progress
[16:12] through our courses we'll reward you
[16:14] with Bitcoin through lightning the next
[16:17] phase of this which is uh phase two will
[16:20] be to build the game and we actually
[16:22] launched our crowdfunding campaign uh a
[16:25] couple weeks ago so this is really
[16:27] exciting for us this will enable us to
[16:29] build the game and the campaign is on
[16:30] timestamp um so if you go to invest.
[16:34] timestamp financial.com you can have a
[16:37] look there but yeah the the the
[16:39] objective here is to make the most
[16:42] accessible simplest friendly on ramp
[16:45] into Bitcoin for beginners I I love the
[16:48] I love the aspect of gamifying Education
[16:51] like making education as as easily
[16:55] accessible as possible and it's also I
[16:58] think we just need as many doors into
[17:01] Bitcoin as possible like we we need the
[17:03] games we we need the books we need the
[17:05] podcast we need everything that you can
[17:08] educate yourself with uh and the more
[17:11] ways we have for people to come to the
[17:13] same conclusion the the the the better
[17:16] it is in the end of the day so I like
[17:19] what you're doing there thank you thank
[17:21] you brother it's uh it's early days for
[17:23] us still but I'm excited about the
[17:24] prospects of building this thing and I
[17:27] think I think it's needed especially if
[17:30] we're trying to get the younger
[17:31] Generations so you know younger
[17:33] Millennials and gen Z to to actually
[17:36] understand Bitcoin their attention spans
[17:38] pretty bad it's about eight seconds
[17:40] these days so you have to really Target
[17:43] the offering of Bitcoin to these to
[17:45] these candidates and I think that
[17:46] Pokemon go is such a
[17:48] universally accepted and and successful
[17:52] model that we want to move that into the
[17:53] Bitcoin space through
[17:55] jippy it's it's uh when we look at the
[17:58] Generations is really funny because when
[18:00] it first uh came into uh Bitcoin like on
[18:04] a local Meetup uh from the online world
[18:07] I thought Bitcoin is the Bitcoin
[18:10] demographic is
[18:11] younger I thought like oh yeah like the
[18:14] like 25 maybe 30 years old something
[18:17] like that but they actually like uh the
[18:19] average age for my YouTube channel uh is
[18:22] like 45 to to 50 actually and I have
[18:26] three times as many people above 65 then
[18:29] under 25 under 25 I basically have
[18:32] almost nobody and under 18 I actually
[18:34] have uh like 0 something percent uh so
[18:38] like the audience is
[18:40] extremely I don't want to say old but
[18:43] it's like extremely mature uh and I
[18:46] thought it's it's the other way around
[18:49] um so that it it seems like Bitcoin only
[18:53] is uh speaking more to um more mature
[18:58] people and the crypto community and the
[19:01] meme coins this is where a lot of the
[19:04] younger crowd is unfortunately yeah yeah
[19:08] you're very right about that fact uh the
[19:10] the problem obviously is
[19:13] that the siren Call of shitcoins is
[19:17] alluring uh I first heard about the
[19:20] space all the way back in 2015 this was
[19:22] before I was fully orange pilled in 2020
[19:25] and even at that time I was sort of
[19:26] trying to understand well what is
[19:28] bitcoin versus ethereum the you know the
[19:30] gold to to bitcoin
[19:32] silver and included thousands and
[19:35] thousands of shitcoins out there and it
[19:36] is alluring it it you know to see like
[19:38] oh we may be the next Bitcoin and we may
[19:40] have an even bigger return um then you
[19:43] spend time researching Bitcoin and you
[19:44] understand it doesn't matter because it
[19:45] was the first and it's going to be the
[19:47] last you know that's the it's the only
[19:49] true
[19:50] intrinsic cryptocurrency valuable
[19:52] cryptocurrency there is uh it's the only
[19:54] one that has value over the time and so
[19:56] we're going to see that but to try and
[19:58] educate the Next Generation about that
[20:00] is a problem because it's so alluring
[20:02] with all these games these crypto
[20:03] casinos they look good they're flashing
[20:05] lights they're they're enjoyable to play
[20:07] with so that's really going to be the
[20:09] biggest value for jippy I think is to
[20:10] try and bring some of that gamification
[20:13] to make it fun and engaging without any
[20:15] of the [ __ ] coinery because we're not
[20:17] about that you know so we want to make
[20:18] it fun and and entertaining but only
[20:21] Bitcoin it's it's uh an an stupid
[20:25] argument that I hear all the time is oh
[20:28] no like uh what do I do with Bitcoin
[20:30] it's just 2 Xing per per year uh I need
[20:34] like the 10x because I don't have
[20:36] money it's like that argument of like I
[20:39] don't have money so I need to put my
[20:41] little amount that I have in like some
[20:44] casino type of investment so I can maybe
[20:48] out like I hear that argument mostly on
[20:51] Tik Tok um uh and mostly on on on short
[20:56] form uh content so like on the long form
[21:00] YouTube video I never heard that
[21:02] argument but it's also interesting how
[21:05] you have different arguments uh
[21:07] depending on what format of of content
[21:09] you have even though it's the same same
[21:11] content but like differently cut um so
[21:15] that that's something that is like no
[21:17] like okay yeah you can gamble you can go
[21:20] into the casino maybe uh you have a
[21:23] lucky day but most likely you lose uh
[21:26] otherwise the casino would not be there
[21:28] the same with the mem coin it's like a a
[21:30] zero sum game and the the people that
[21:33] invent the coin usually win and the
[21:35] people that invest in it usually
[21:38] lose 100% there's a reason why Vegas
[21:41] looks like Vegas you know glittering
[21:43] buildings flashing lights Beautiful
[21:45] People beautiful places is because they
[21:46] have all the money and they it's
[21:48] basically a grand lassy a big old theft
[21:51] from people who are willing to part with
[21:53] their hard earned money so yeah I think
[21:56] that the model with jippy um
[21:59] is going to be very important and it
[22:00] would look something like this we would
[22:04] educate a whole bunch of folks in the
[22:07] ways of Bitcoin from beginner to
[22:09] intermediate to master so you sort of
[22:11] have a structured Pathway to send people
[22:14] through and whilst they earn sets for
[22:17] for their time then we introduce them to
[22:19] tribe Clash which is Pokemon go for
[22:21] Bitcoin and the model here is we would
[22:23] have 21 Real World territories in your
[22:27] city and you would join a tribe of
[22:30] bitcoiners with your friends and the
[22:32] objective here is to compete to claim
[22:34] territories so we would release one new
[22:36] territory each week for someone in your
[22:38] tribe to claim and they need to be boots
[22:40] on the ground in that territory and they
[22:43] claim it by answering a quiz question
[22:45] about Bitcoin so if you answer the
[22:48] question correctly the fastest whilst
[22:49] you're competing with other people other
[22:51] tribe members you're then able to claim
[22:53] a Bitcoin beast and this Beast will be
[22:56] themed in some aspect of bit coin like
[22:58] Nakamoto Nick blockchain Bob sat Sarah
[23:01] so there's education there too the only
[23:04] way for you to catch the Beast obviously
[23:05] is to know about Bitcoin so that's where
[23:07] the education element as well comes in
[23:09] the most amazing valuable aspect I think
[23:12] here apart from those two things is the
[23:14] winning tribe will then win half a
[23:16] Bitcoin so there is a high ticket value
[23:18] item for you to compete and learn and
[23:21] actually earn to so that's really the
[23:23] magic I think that we're going to be
[23:24] building over the next few
[23:26] months I like it I think it it has the
[23:29] potential to uh grab attention from a
[23:34] different crowd I hope so too at
[23:36] least me too yeah me too it's it's it's
[23:39] been hard to raise money in in in the
[23:42] bare market for sure but you know with
[23:43] this new new all-time high it seems like
[23:46] we're going to be rallying around a
[23:48] potential 100K price uh which would be
[23:50] fantastic and hopefully that would mean
[23:52] that there's more money flowing into the
[23:53] space because us Bitcoin Builders do
[23:56] need a little bit of support now and
[23:57] again we don't have all of the wonderful
[23:59] shitcoin money that comes in from having
[24:00] a shitcoin casino so we're really
[24:02] relying on building value that actually
[24:05] furthers Bitcoin it just means that it's
[24:07] it's harder to find a revenue stream we
[24:09] think this could be it for us how is
[24:12] that raising money in Bitcoin because
[24:15] Bitcoin bitcoiners who have a lot of
[24:17] Bitcoin they have their own um Bitcoin
[24:20] reserve and they measure and investment
[24:22] against that reserve and it's pretty
[24:25] hard to compete with uh a 2X return
[24:28] every year here uh it's it's it's it's
[24:31] like it has to be a really valuable and
[24:33] great idea where someone goes ahead and
[24:35] like yeah I will take out money from
[24:37] Bitcoin and I will give you that because
[24:40] I think you will beat Bitcoin yeah I
[24:42] mean listen we we're going through that
[24:44] process right now uh it's been a slug
[24:45] already throughout the beginning of the
[24:47] year we we only launched a couple two
[24:49] three months ago so we're still quite
[24:51] fresh and so this process of fundraising
[24:53] is is really raw and new for us and
[24:55] that's why I think we've gone down the
[24:56] route with Tim stamp and crowd funding
[24:59] is because you need bitcoiners to buy
[25:02] into the vision of what this product is
[25:04] going to be and I personally think that
[25:06] it's going to add a lot of value to the
[25:07] space I I think that we could become the
[25:09] the largest most popular onramp into
[25:11] Bitcoin for beginners if we get this
[25:13] right and so um yeah we just need to
[25:16] start these conversations and and we're
[25:18] currently around 50k uh invested um
[25:21] which is a good start we're looking to
[25:23] raise to a maximum of 250k um it's hard
[25:27] it's a challenge you know people don't
[25:29] want to part with their Bitcoin at the
[25:30] end of the day um so unless they see a
[25:32] really really strong vision and that's
[25:34] my job as CEO of of jippy is to try and
[25:36] communicate that Vision effectively it's
[25:39] super interesting what do you think uh
[25:40] as you have now the uh you you you kind
[25:43] of live through that uh in in that small
[25:47] window right now but what what do you
[25:50] imagine when we have only Bitcoin and
[25:53] like this this vision of Bitcoin is kind
[25:55] of fulfilled how how different
[25:58] do you think will uh starting a startup
[26:02] the The Venture Capital space how how
[26:05] different will be that space that's a
[26:07] very good question people will hold on
[26:09] to their M their value their money more
[26:11] more closely I'm sure you can't you
[26:14] can't have a society that prints away
[26:17] value anymore and you can't have a uh
[26:20] what is essentially Fiat which is
[26:22] government money is basically the money
[26:24] of War you know you can't print money
[26:25] for war anymore and de Bas the currency
[26:27] so I think people will closely hold
[26:29] money to their chest but it remains to
[26:31] be seen at the end of the day we're all
[26:33] speculating this is a first territory
[26:35] for us um but we could probably assume
[26:39] hopefully a few thousand years of peace
[26:42] I mean you know when under a gold
[26:44] standard we saw Society saw such
[26:47] prosperity and growth and some of the
[26:49] most amazing Innovations for Humanity
[26:51] was during that time so we might see
[26:52] another Revolution uh during the Bitcoin
[26:55] hyperbitcoinization phase which which
[26:58] we're we're all hoping for at the end of
[26:59] the day we're getting close uh but there
[27:01] there may still be a few decades out and
[27:04] and the crazy thing is we don't only
[27:06] have Bitcoin like we have the internet
[27:08] we have the globalization we have the
[27:10] digitalization uh on top of that which
[27:13] makes uh transfer of information way
[27:16] more effective than compared to the gold
[27:19] ages where we only had gold where it was
[27:22] hard to communicate from America uh to
[27:25] the UK to Austria to Australia now it's
[27:27] super easy now the whole world is
[27:29] connected I partner up with American
[27:30] companies I connect with guests all over
[27:33] the world uh it's it's it's like there's
[27:36] no friction you just like choose your
[27:38] place where you stay on that world where
[27:40] you are treated best where your Bitcoin
[27:41] are treated best and then you can
[27:43] connect with the whole world that I
[27:45] think that that that could that that
[27:47] could actually usher in like a golden
[27:50] age like an actual golden age uh for for
[27:54] Prosperity yeah I I really hope so um I
[27:57] mean at the end of the day Fiat is is an
[28:00] experiment prior to 1913 which is when
[28:03] we we the early stages of coming off of
[28:06] the gold standard started to to show
[28:08] itself uh and I can go into that in a
[28:10] second because it's really interesting
[28:11] um we we enter into
[28:13] that um information into into jippy um
[28:17] but yeah the um before that point you
[28:20] know we've had Humanity using gold as
[28:21] money for thousands of years and it has
[28:24] it having scarce money is important
[28:26] because you you can't debase it you
[28:27] can't create more of it you need scarce
[28:29] money so that it maintains its value
[28:31] through time and Bitcoin is the scarcest
[28:33] money known to man so prior to 1913 we
[28:36] had good money we had sound money and
[28:38] after 1913 that's arguably when we could
[28:41] start to see the degradation of society
[28:44] accelerate um and I don't know how many
[28:46] people know this I mean it's it's
[28:47] definitely interesting but so uh World
[28:50] War I which was 1914 so it's actually my
[28:53] brethren so the British government that
[28:55] can be thanked for destroying money
[28:57] because um the Government tried to raise
[29:00] 350 million pounds um and they tried to
[29:03] do that through issuing War loans uh the
[29:07] issue is that nobody wanted to join the
[29:09] war in the UK no one wanted to finance
[29:11] the war and so um they only actually
[29:14] managed to raise 91.1 million so they
[29:16] were actually hugely UND undersubscribed
[29:19] so what did they do what did the
[29:21] government do well with with the bank of
[29:23] England which is a central bank in the
[29:25] UK they couldn't raise the money to
[29:27] finance the war it was a massive failure
[29:29] so what did they do well the bank of
[29:31] England decided to create the money out
[29:33] of thin air and purchase the war bonds
[29:36] as an IOU and that's how we can see the
[29:39] debt-based money today it it's literally
[29:41] just printing money out of thin air to
[29:42] finance Wars and ridiculous expenditure
[29:45] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[29:49] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[29:52] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[29:54] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[29:57] vigilant made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[30:00] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[30:04] go out there and show that you are a
[30:06] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:09] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[30:12] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:14] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:17] collections you have the date of the
[30:19] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[30:23] and of course also the block height and
[30:25] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[30:29] level of detail they put in in this
[30:31] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:34] those amazing coin Vigilant the time
[30:36] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[30:39] those watches so so much if you watch or
[30:43] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[30:45] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[30:48] and now the most important step is to
[30:50] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[30:53] hardware wallet my personal
[30:55] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:57] the bit box it's super secure it's
[30:59] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[31:01] for a friend who has still their Bitcoin

[31:07] discount with the code Robin at the
[31:10] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss Robin to
[31:14] get your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:17] really level up your sovereignty as an
[31:19] individual you have to have the most
[31:22] secure self custody setup you have to
[31:24] secure your own devices you have to
[31:27] protect protect your privacy you have to
[31:29] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[31:32] on where you live you even want to have
[31:35] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[31:37] move in case something goes really
[31:39] really wrong and through all those steps

[31:50] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[31:53] out how you can level up your
[31:56] sovereignty the this is super
[31:58] interesting that it it started like that
[32:01] and now uh we we kind of have to close
[32:04] the loop to like what impact does it
[32:07] have for Wars when all of the sudden uh
[32:09] the people that live in that
[32:11] jurisdiction that wants to have War
[32:14] actually have to vote with their money
[32:17] to have uh War because if if there's no
[32:19] war and there's normal taxes and there's
[32:22] no way to print money uh you use that
[32:25] money to build roads to build whatever
[32:28] uh and you have your normal tax rate
[32:30] then the government has to come to uh
[32:32] all the citizens says Hey I want to
[32:35] raise your taxes by I don't know 100%
[32:37] 50% 200% whatever depends on what war
[32:40] they planning on um to raise the money
[32:44] or with loans or what with whatever uh
[32:46] instrument they want to do that uh what
[32:49] if this is not there anymore that that's
[32:52] that just ends uh those like useless
[32:56] Wars I guess
[32:59] yeah I agree it it it could shepher in a
[33:02] an amazing prosperous time for Humanity
[33:04] that should hopefully last for thousands
[33:06] of years well hundreds or or thousands
[33:07] of years so we'll see uh Bitcoin at the
[33:10] end of the day is the the best tool that
[33:12] we have and I would certainly be worried
[33:14] for Humanity if it were to fail I I
[33:15] don't think that we have any other
[33:17] weapon that's nonviolent that can be
[33:19] used to to defang the state um you know
[33:23] we do have the guns here that's kind of
[33:24] nice um but at the end of the day you
[33:27] can't always go around shooting your way
[33:29] out of problems there are there are
[33:30] other Solutions and and monetarily
[33:33] Bitcoin is is the biggest tool we have
[33:36] absolutely what do you think is the
[33:39] biggest challenge towards that future
[33:42] what is the biggest challenge for for
[33:43] Bitcoin that we we might face in the
[33:45] next years yeah I
[33:48] mean it remains to be seen what the next
[33:50] four years are going to look like and if
[33:52] Trump actually follows through with with
[33:53] the Bitcoin Reserve um because that
[33:55] would be a huge value proposition for
[33:58] the public to actually notice that we're
[33:59] going to partly we're going to pay some
[34:01] of our $ 35 trillion doll debt by
[34:04] holding Bitcoin and so we see that debt
[34:07] increase until Bitcoin is used to pay
[34:09] that debt and and so that could be a
[34:11] really solid indication that that it's
[34:14] here to stay at least in the Public's
[34:15] the Z guides The public's mind that
[34:17] Bitcoin is here to stay but we don't
[34:20] know
[34:21] um even if even if Trump doesn't do that
[34:26] uh Bitcoin will succeed in my opinion
[34:29] but it will potentially be a fight you
[34:30] know let's say we have four years of him
[34:32] and then we get some insane flip that
[34:36] sometimes happens you know you get blue
[34:37] and then red and then blue and then red
[34:38] it's it's a seesaw like effect with
[34:40] American politics and the next candidate
[34:42] is very anti- Bitcoin and they're very
[34:44] Pro
[34:45] cbdc that could also actually have a net
[34:48] positive effect on bitcoin because
[34:49] people are noticing that money now has
[34:52] all of the strings attached you know you
[34:54] can't use cash anymore we a cashless
[34:56] economy you're uh your your um your
[35:00] centralized digital currency is tied to
[35:03] your credit score so now you can't buy
[35:05] things if you are saying bad things
[35:07] about the government so it starts to get
[35:09] a little bit hairy scary there I think
[35:11] in my opinion but either way no matter
[35:14] what happens with those two outcomes I
[35:15] think that that Bitcoin will just
[35:18] continue to eat the world it's it's
[35:19] super interesting with with cbdcs uh as
[35:22] in America they are extremely against
[35:25] cbdcs and uh also the government is like
[35:29] kind of on on this train of like let's
[35:31] fight against it and let's make sure
[35:33] it's not happening in Europe it's it's
[35:36] kind of the other way around where uh
[35:38] the the central bank and the EU is
[35:41] really fighting for that and
[35:42] steamrolling ahead on on this topic
[35:45] which kind of is like maybe I should not
[35:48] be here I don't know if if they actually
[35:51] do that and uh I think Game Theory um
[35:55] Game Theory will be very interesting uh
[35:57] see seeing the next five years of
[35:59] Bitcoin and cbdcs across the world it
[36:02] will it will and if you get scared come
[36:03] join us in in Texas we would love to
[36:05] have you with the more the
[36:08] marrier absolutely I mean that's
[36:10] actually um a thing of mine because I am
[36:15] like I I have a private group and and
[36:17] stuff like that so like people actually
[36:18] join there and mostly Americans in there
[36:21] and then there are also a lot of like
[36:24] friendship ships just built over time
[36:26] with a YouTube channel and with the
[36:27] connections and I have now already so
[36:31] many Connections in America and 50% of
[36:34] my audience is in the USA so like USA is
[36:37] like a huge uh huge huge audience space
[36:40] and then there's like Canada there's UK
[36:43] there's all the other places where
[36:44] people speak English as my podcast is
[36:46] English speaking uh Austria where I'm
[36:48] from there's like
[36:50] 0.3% of something like that very very
[36:53] small obviously because we have a lot of
[36:55] good German content also um but yeah
[36:58] like it's not out of the question that
[37:00] at some point I might live not in
[37:03] Austria but maybe in America maybe
[37:05] somewhere else I don't know uh but the
[37:07] the incentive has to be really good for
[37:09] that either the incentive to go there uh
[37:12] like as a as a pull factor or the push
[37:14] factor away from uh the EU uh let's see
[37:18] I'm I'm quite hopeful actually for the
[37:20] EU because when you saw the latest uh
[37:24] elections across all the the CEST there
[37:27] um it seems like the EU critical uh
[37:31] parties the parties that actually say
[37:33] like oh that's that's not as good uh
[37:36] that we have so much control from the EU
[37:38] with the digital service act that we
[37:40] have the the cbdcs and stuff like that
[37:42] those parties actually were the election
[37:45] winners uh in in most countries over the
[37:48] last few months and year so uh that
[37:51] might that's like a small hope for me uh
[37:54] but yeah if if if they do something that
[37:57] I really don't like um I have Bitcoin I
[38:00] can move wherever I want so that that
[38:01] that's a great thing to have yeah that's
[38:04] encouraging and it's good to see some
[38:07] some swings to the right in in Europe
[38:09] for sure I think the UK is still having
[38:11] problems you know we just elected a
[38:13] labor government so Uber Uber crazy
[38:15] liberal in the UK um and it remains to
[38:19] be seen what their policies are going to
[38:21] be around cbdcs and and how strongly
[38:23] they're going to push those because at
[38:24] the end of the day you know they're all
[38:25] just puppets be it the the conservative
[38:28] government or the liberal government
[38:29] they're all just puppets paid by the
[38:30] central banks and and the establishment
[38:33] so um it it definitely worries me I
[38:36] think we saw we saw some really pretty
[38:39] crazy things of 2020 I I really do think
[38:41] that they were trying to push uh social
[38:44] credit score and cbdcs with with with
[38:46] the covid uh the the tracking app and
[38:49] all that stuff you had to show QR codes
[38:51] and all the the medical information that
[38:54] you had to provide before entering a
[38:55] business so I I think that they were
[38:56] trying to push it as a test um
[38:59] fortunately it failed and and we push
[39:02] back as a population but it's not going
[39:04] to stop them from trying again you know
[39:06] so I think my my biggest advice to any
[39:09] folks who are thinking about their uh
[39:11] their freedoms and their Liberties is is
[39:13] try and think of an exit strategy and
[39:16] think about where you would want to go
[39:17] America is the last hold out in my
[39:19] opinion for for freedom and Liberties
[39:21] that's why we have um you know first
[39:23] amendment Second Amendment Etc um we
[39:26] we're protected um to some degree not
[39:28] the same extent in in Europe I would say
[39:30] how do you look at countries like El
[39:33] Salvador or other places where freedom
[39:35] is a little bit higher and uh but they
[39:37] are very small countri so probably
[39:39] cannot protect themselves if actually
[39:41] something something happened that's
[39:43] different with America because they have
[39:45] a lot of force also how do you look at
[39:48] that yeah it's still it's it's early for
[39:51] them obviously uh I I I think that it's
[39:54] encouraging to see places like Bitcoin
[39:56] Beach of evolving and you have
[39:58] businesses accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[40:00] is actually legal tender there so you
[40:02] can actually genuinely use Bitcoin for
[40:03] any purchase it's it's really great but
[40:06] it is early days uh and I think that for
[40:09] what I'm hearing boots on the ground
[40:11] there it's it's still it has a way to go
[40:14] to try to match the quality of life that
[40:15] we have here you know in in America and
[40:17] other places uh but it is a good hold
[40:19] out you know if if America for whatever
[40:21] reason does fall you do have these
[40:23] places you have Mexico you have El
[40:24] Salvador you have places you can go to
[40:26] that would be
[40:28] a Bitcoin Citadel for folks uh because
[40:30] that's what you want at the end of the
[40:31] day you know you want a way to to to
[40:33] hedge against tyranny and that is a
[40:35] citadel and that means that you have
[40:37] Bitcoin at your fingertips hopefully
[40:39] guns at your fingertips something to
[40:41] protect
[40:42] yourself one thing that we discussed
[40:44] before a little bit is is lightning
[40:46] already but you mentioned that there's
[40:49] uh some some problems that you also see
[40:50] with that do you think that lightning is
[40:52] the is the is the main thing uh that
[40:55] that we will focus on or is like how do
[40:58] you see also the
[41:01] development sorry apparently they heard
[41:03] us talking so they I'm being arrested
[41:08] now what was that was was Microsoft
[41:11] talking with you yeah this is the fire
[41:13] alarm
[41:14] test oh there's a fire alarm test yes
[41:18] it's either that or the government's
[41:19] listening and they want to get rid of me
[41:20] which is possible
[41:22] to I don't know how long going to last
[41:25] are you in a in a in a public building
[41:27] or is it like in your home I'm in my
[41:29] apartment yeah I'm in apartment in
[41:31] downtown
[41:32] Austin and and you and you have those
[41:34] fire alarms yeah occasionally it run it
[41:37] goes through the whole building we have
[41:39] uh Mainline fire alarm systems and so it
[41:41] it can get pretty loud honestly pretty
[41:44] loud hopefully stop now that that that's
[41:47] super interesting and I never saw that
[41:50] like obviously we we also have fire
[41:52] alarms but um it's you have to test them
[41:56] yourself like like they're just like
[41:58] things that you put on there and they're
[42:01] not connected to anything they're just
[42:03] like making a lot of noise if they
[42:05] attack smoke is it's a smoke detector in
[42:08] the end of the day uh so not really a
[42:10] fire alarm system uh but I never saw uh
[42:14] anything like that I I saw it in public
[42:16] places like in schools and and stuff
[42:18] like that they have more advanced
[42:19] systems but uh it's like actually in
[42:22] your apartment where you have also
[42:24] speaker where someone actually speaks
[42:26] with you that that's amazing yeah it's
[42:28] pretty crazy I mean all it's it's
[42:29] mainlined into the building like a
[42:31] school or like a government building
[42:33] there's literally a big old speaker on
[42:34] the on the the the wall so it would
[42:37] blast out and it would be everywhere in
[42:38] the whole building if there was a fire
[42:39] for example so it's it's pretty pretty
[42:42] crazy uh who has the microphone for the
[42:46] of speakers yeah I want to know that too
[42:49] myself uh someone in a dark room
[42:51] somewhere probably below below on the
[42:53] lower levels of the building I would say
[42:56] oh but it but it's
[42:57] uh um privately owned not like the the
[43:00] state is like say firearm into no
[43:03] thankfully no no no that would not be
[43:05] accepted no it's a privately privately
[43:07] owned building and we have I'm assuming
[43:10] some folks on staff uh that that run all
[43:13] these systems yeah okay interesting yeah
[43:16] sorry for that sorry question that was
[43:18] my I wasn't even given no test this is
[43:21] going to happen today uh so apologies
[43:23] about that I I learned something new
[43:25] with it uh I think that those are the
[43:27] those are the moments where we learn
[43:29] really cool um I I asked about lightning
[43:32] how you see lightning scale up and uh
[43:35] bit Bitcoin in general um scaling up
[43:38] because we have almost no one when you
[43:40] compare to the whole world using Bitcoin
[43:43] now uh how do you think it is when
[43:46] Bitcoin actually is used by four or five
[43:48] billion people yeah um that I mean that
[43:51] is the objective at the end of the day
[43:52] is you for us to sort of maintain the
[43:55] same throughput as as MasterCard Visa I
[43:58] think the objective with Bitcoin is to
[44:00] become a faster form of money and that
[44:03] means that the throughput has to
[44:05] increase because really what we're
[44:07] limited by now with Bitcoin is we're
[44:10] limited by block size so the block size
[44:12] is about 4 megabytes and what that means
[44:14] is per day we can have about 400 500,000
[44:18] transactions that occur that's rather
[44:20] limiting that's a small percentage when
[44:22] you compare it to something like Visa
[44:23] the Visa network is is huge um so what's
[44:27] happened is we have this layer two
[44:28] technology called lightning which is a
[44:30] payments Network on top of uh Bitcoin
[44:33] and and with that basically you can
[44:36] scale transactions much faster so you
[44:38] can actually have about a million
[44:39] transactions per second theoretically so
[44:41] the throughput really increases the
[44:44] problem though is that we're still in a
[44:45] position where some of these
[44:46] transactions are failing perhaps the
[44:48] lower scale the lower number
[44:50] transactions are failing um there was a
[44:52] study done by river actually so in 2018
[44:56] River is one of the large Bitcoin
[44:58] exchanges um in 2018 lightning payments
[45:01] were failing about half of the time
[45:02] which is pretty high I mean you don't
[45:05] want that with money you want your
[45:06] transaction to be final at the end of
[45:07] the day and you don't want it to fail
[45:09] closer to so 2022 um it was successful
[45:13] about 98.7% of the time according to
[45:15] River so that shows there's Improvement
[45:18] but from what I've heard we're still at
[45:20] the point where a transaction will fail
[45:22] multiple times before it succeeds I
[45:24] don't know what that number is exactly
[45:26] I'm not a a bit coin developer but um or
[45:28] lightning developer but I know that it
[45:30] doesn't happen on the first
[45:31] try it's also interesting I hear a lot
[45:34] that we need Beyond lightning something
[45:37] like lightning is just the first step
[45:39] and then we need like federations and we
[45:41] need other ecash systems and fed uh I
[45:45] honestly um I always focus on the main
[45:47] layer and uh I trust that there are a
[45:50] lot of smart people inside of Bitcoin
[45:52] that develop all those great apps and
[45:55] until now I see that happening uh so how
[45:58] do you see that like do do you see that
[46:00] we have like then a lot of layer tws or
[46:03] connect layer 3es or something like that
[46:06] yeah I'm the same as you when it comes
[46:07] to this um I'm I'm a little bit further
[46:09] away from the main core development of
[46:11] of Bitcoin all layer to networks um I
[46:14] trust there are some really amazing
[46:16] people working on some good Solutions so
[46:18] when it comes to to to jippy role you
[46:21] know we do use lightning we have
[46:23] integrated jolts which is a lightning
[46:25] API and so we get all of our rewards
[46:27] through them they do all the custody and
[46:29] they run the lightning nodes which is
[46:31] quite nice so we can offload some of
[46:33] that anxiety and and the issues there um
[46:37] but yeah I mean this is this is the
[46:38] beginning I mean we're going to see an
[46:40] explosion in in uh productivity tools
[46:44] with with layer 2 I'm sure of it um and
[46:46] even you know you're you're seeing some
[46:48] of the social media side too with nosta
[46:51] and things like that so it's it's
[46:53] exciting to see but I know that the
[46:55] thing that drives me every day
[46:57] is just seeing Bitcoin adoption grow um
[47:00] layer zero like layer one like that's
[47:02] that's my bread and butter um and trying
[47:04] to educate people on that H that's
[47:06] that's the most important right now I
[47:07] also think so um when we look at Nostra
[47:11] as as as you said social media and and
[47:14] and lightning there's like no there
[47:16] other apps that allow that no a protocol
[47:19] uh for Primal and and and those apps uh
[47:23] do you think after we decentralized
[47:25] money all things will will kind of
[47:28] follow or how do you see that
[47:30] development I think it would have to you
[47:33] know we we still have to some degree
[47:35] centralized
[47:37] information having Elon Musk by Twitter
[47:40] probably saved us saved societies it
[47:43] definitely saved America and and
[47:44] probably led to the outcome of this
[47:46] election you know um because to some
[47:48] degree we we have decentralized
[47:49] information now through Twitter before
[47:52] old Twitter was co-opted by the state um
[47:54] by the central agencies um and buy some
[47:57] leftwing lunatics so it's it's good to
[47:59] see this evolving but let's say there
[48:01] was a case where you get someone in
[48:03] government like the other candidate who
[48:05] is very anti- decentralization um
[48:09] there's a possibility where they would
[48:10] shut down Twitter and that means that we
[48:12] would have to then jump to the next best
[48:14] alternative so if that to to occur you
[48:17] would probably see a bunch of people
[48:19] jumping to to nosta um the learning
[48:21] curve is still quite large I would say
[48:23] people still need to sort of understand
[48:26] what is public private key pairs what
[48:28] how does that relate to an account
[48:29] because you don't really have an account
[48:30] with an email and a password anymore you
[48:32] know so there's further education to be
[48:34] done in the space absolutely yeah and I
[48:37] saw it firstand for myself I downloaded
[48:41] it and and tried it like one year ago
[48:43] and I gave up on it and I was like Ah
[48:45] that's not ready for for Mass adoption
[48:47] and for a social media platform that's
[48:50] really important like for a social media
[48:52] platform that lives on a network effect
[48:54] it lives from the people that are using
[48:56] that
[48:57] um and there is no Financial incentive
[49:00] to do it like in Bitcoin um there's a
[49:02] big Financial incentives to be early in
[49:05] there uh for a social media platform
[49:07] it's not like when you are in early you
[49:10] will gain massively from that maybe you
[49:12] gain an audience from that but you
[49:14] constantly have to develop that Bitcoin
[49:16] you just like have to hold to
[49:18] financially gain from that uh and now uh
[49:21] I got back on like two three months ago
[49:24] and it's in a massive uh way better
[49:28] experience now I I use Primal I I I
[49:30] tried a few of them and Primal was for
[49:32] me the the best looking and the best
[49:35] feeling uh and it's actually it's
[49:38] growing fast and it it feels like
[49:39] Bitcoin in in 2012 even though I was
[49:42] nowhere near Bitcoin in 2012 uh but it
[49:45] it feels like that that rawness this
[49:48] this earliness of of of that platform
[49:51] and has a huge potential I also feel
[49:54] like that yeah so exciting and it it is
[49:58] noticeable that things are improving the
[50:00] UI and the ux of these apps are
[50:01] improving obviously web 2 has had
[50:03] Decades of time to perfect how things
[50:06] look and how things work that I would
[50:08] say is something I deeply care about as
[50:09] someone with a background in in design
[50:11] and software engineering uh being a
[50:13] software engineer for about five years
[50:14] before that design so we at JPY deeply
[50:18] care about how these these these tools
[50:20] are going to look and how they're going
[50:21] to be
[50:25] hopefully prior ized around the uiux so
[50:28] someone who is a beginner should ideally
[50:30] not have to think the cognitive load
[50:32] should not be too heavy on them to
[50:34] understand what these things do
[50:36] absolutely how important do you think is
[50:39] community for that like how important is
[50:42] uh the the the the community aspect in
[50:46] general of of Bitcoin sometimes I feel
[50:48] like maybe it's bad even like it's a bad
[50:51] feature because we are so tribalistic
[50:54] about everything how do you look at that
[50:57] I think it's very important especially
[50:58] from the funding side you know you like
[51:01] I mentioned with Bitcoin the
[51:02] monetization is different these tools
[51:05] are usually open source which means that
[51:07] there isn't the same level of success
[51:10] monetary success that you would see if
[51:11] you were making a shitcoin for example
[51:13] you know we don't have tokens that we're
[51:14] floating around we're not scamming
[51:16] people out of money this is actually
[51:18] tools this is tools that would better
[51:20] humanity and that generally means it's
[51:21] open source which means anyone can
[51:23] download it and copy the code which
[51:24] means there's no money in it so to build
[51:27] on these layer 2 uh networks you need a
[51:32] way to monetize and so thankfully the
[51:34] network has the support of people like
[51:37] hrf so human rights foundation and opats
[51:39] and these are um are institutions that
[51:42] provide grants and resources to
[51:44] developers who want to build on these
[51:46] things and so that is really the power
[51:48] of community hopefully we'll see even
[51:50] more money flowing into the space uh I
[51:52] know that some of these big Bitcoin
[51:55] companies like um unchain for example
[51:57] they just do amazing things for the
[51:59] community here in Austin we have we have
[52:01] Bitcoin Commons which is a co-working
[52:03] space for bitcoiners there's some
[52:04] Bitcoin companies there we have ple laab
[52:06] and jippy is a is a on the current ple
[52:09] laab accelerator program and they do
[52:11] amazing things for the community as well
[52:12] so we are in this together uh Bitcoin is
[52:16] is a group project I would say very nice
[52:19] really cool perfect then uh let's come
[52:22] to the question that I asked every one
[52:24] of my guest what can we learn from you
[52:27] besides Bitcoin oh that's a good
[52:29] question I like that
[52:30] one
[52:33] um I would say that apart from Bitcoin
[52:37] what drives me is is this desire to
[52:42] understand the world and this this
[52:44] desire to understand why I'm here um I
[52:47] think so much truth has been lost to
[52:51] time tools like breathing and meditation
[52:54] and all these ancient tools that have
[52:56] helped Humanity for thousands of years
[52:58] they're slowly making a comeback with
[52:59] all this mindfulness stuff unfortunately
[53:01] it's um it's been bit a little cooptive
[53:04] by the left I would say but there's
[53:06] definitely some truth there um I
[53:08] meditate every day I find it very very
[53:10] important as as a way to sort of ground
[53:12] my nervous system uh and when I'm
[53:14] definitely in stress I will do a
[53:16] breathing exercise that was inspired by
[53:18] whm Hoff and this guy this Iceman is
[53:21] insane I mean he literally just through
[53:23] breathing alone is able to withstand
[53:27] things that this human body should not
[53:28] withstand like climbing Mount Everest
[53:31] naked with no clothes where any other
[53:34] man would die or expelling a a uh
[53:38] infection from his body with just
[53:40] breathing and so this is a really strong
[53:42] tool I think it it's quite weird when
[53:44] you do the breathing exercise that he
[53:45] does it's sort of like a hard reset for
[53:48] an iPhone but for your body and it's
[53:50] very peculiar your whole body will like
[53:51] vibrate so I recommend looking into that
[53:54] stuff I I I I tried that once it's
[53:57] intense so like whm whm Hof uh he has a
[54:00] YouTube channel and you can actually
[54:02] like preve along and do his exercises uh
[54:06] he's also a lot on podcast like you can
[54:07] really like get deep in in what he does
[54:10] I it's it's really cool uh to to see so
[54:14] many um great tools to navigate your
[54:18] life too and I think Wim Hof does a does
[54:21] a great job uh in in that and he's a
[54:24] crazy crazy person I I like those
[54:27] characters me too because you need them
[54:29] you know you need them we're we the
[54:30] society is not not the same as it was
[54:32] back then we're all straight laed and
[54:34] quite uh you
[54:36] know yeah Society has just changed so I
[54:38] think you need people on the outskirts
[54:40] to just s of prod and push and just
[54:41] remind us that there's other stuff out
[54:43] there that we don't know you know
[54:44] hallucinogenics all these things DMT I
[54:46] mean I could spend countless hours
[54:48] researching this stuff and being very
[54:49] interested in it doesn't mean I want to
[54:51] take it I've been told it's like fired
[54:55] through a cannon into a Universe you
[54:57] know there's there's lots of mysteries
[54:59] out there and it it's just a reminder
[55:01] that the world is bigger than what's in
[55:02] front of us I'm curently uh reading the
[55:06] book you can't hurt me from David gargin
[55:08] uh that's that's an amazing one I even
[55:11] uh I don't know if anyone ever did it
[55:14] like that he I was like the audiobook
[55:17] version of it and he did the Audi book
[55:20] and after each c um after each chapter
[55:24] he does a podcast kind of of a style
[55:27] where the guy who actually wrote the
[55:29] book for him or with him uh interviews
[55:32] him to that chapter and so it's very
[55:34] long it's like 14 hours so I'm halfway
[55:38] through uh but that that book is really
[55:41] good like he David gargin is one of
[55:43] those guys who definitely stretch the
[55:45] limits of what's possible with the human
[55:47] body do do you know about him no no so
[55:50] what would be the the the big takeaway
[55:52] from the book so far would you say uh
[55:55] that when really want something your
[55:58] body is capable of a lot more uh uh than
[56:03] than you give him credit to he is like a
[56:07] Navy Seals uh and he was like complet
[56:10] completely overweight and he has this
[56:11] amazing Story how he went from like lazy
[56:14] overweight to being the top Navy Seals I
[56:16] think he holds the record for the most
[56:19] pull-ups in like 24 hours uh some some
[56:23] some crazy things like that uh he's a
[56:25] he's a real machine uh and I I can just
[56:29] like if if you ever feel unmotivated or
[56:33] you you begin to slow down in life to
[56:36] just listen to his story and you're like
[56:38] oh [ __ ] like I'm a I'm a [ __ ] I have to
[56:41] work like I don't I don't do anything uh
[56:45] in my life like I really have to go get
[56:47] going now uh it's it's it's really
[56:49] motivating this book and uh it's it's
[56:52] fascinating stories uh and I think
[56:55] especially valuable I mean it doesn't
[56:57] apply for me because I had an amazing
[56:59] childhood but he had an really bad
[57:03] childhood like like really bad uh so for
[57:07] anyone who has some kind of trauma or
[57:10] some kind of bad childhood um that that
[57:13] is a book I think that that that helps
[57:15] you a lot uh but yeah that's that's just
[57:18] uh that that's what I'm currently
[57:20] reading and I I I do like it a lot
[57:22] because I am one person that uh also
[57:26] quits books like if if if like half or
[57:29] 25% in like I don't like it I like yeah
[57:32] let's let's throw it if it was not that
[57:34] good uh but that is it's 14 hours long
[57:37] and and I'm like hour seven or eight and
[57:40] it's it's it keeps getting better like
[57:42] it's it's fascinating for me wow I'm I'm
[57:45] going to need to to listen to that next
[57:47] I'm a runner so I tend to listen to to
[57:49] podcasts and books on on Audible and
[57:51] other things when I run so that would be
[57:53] a really good thing for me to do yeah
[57:54] AUD great yeah fascinated absolutely
[57:58] it's I also listen on an audible and
[58:01] yeah it's it's
[58:02] long material but that sounds really
[58:05] really cool absolutely perfect uh then
[58:09] uh thank you so much uh oh before we
[58:11] have we have an tine I almost forgot the
[58:13] end routine today wow uh would it be
[58:15] would be the first time that I forgot
[58:17] the end routine but I did not um we have
[58:19] an end routine in the podcast where the
[58:21] previous guest is asking a question for
[58:23] the next guest without knowing who the
[58:24] next guest actually is and the question
[58:26] from the previous guest is do you work
[58:28] in Bitcoin why or why not I can already
[58:31] answer you the first one you work in
[58:33] Bitcoin so I will ask ask you why do you
[58:36] work in Bitcoin I think the answer is
[58:38] simple is that this is my calling um I
[58:42] don't think that there is any
[58:43] bigger problem for Humanity to solve
[58:46] than the problem of broken money and
[58:48] we're seeing Society falling apart
[58:51] crumbling because of our corrupted
[58:54] monetary Supply and because are the way
[58:56] that incentives are are built around
[58:59] broken money government food agriculture
[59:03] War it's all because of that so if
[59:05] there's
[59:06] anything that I could Point towards a
[59:09] mission that would help Humanity it
[59:10] would be making Bitcoin the global
[59:12] Reserve currency and that's hopefully
[59:15] I'll get to see that in my lifetime and
[59:16] say that I was a part of that process
[59:19] amazing I love to see it really really
