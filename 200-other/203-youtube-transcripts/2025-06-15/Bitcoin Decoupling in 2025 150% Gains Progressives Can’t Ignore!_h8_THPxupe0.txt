[00:00] Progressive case for Bitcoin is
[00:02] potentially even stronger than the
[00:03] conservative one that are a huge barrier
[00:05] to entry for a lot of people because
[00:08] they see it through political lenses and
[00:10] all these other lenses that exist at the
[00:13] you know fiscal political layer and
[00:15] above and what I think bitcoiners are
[00:17] very attuned to is the monetary layer
[00:21] beneath that and we need to do a better
[00:23] job of getting people to understand that
[00:24] layer uh so that they can understand how
[00:26] the problems tend to originate at that
[00:29] layer and up to those if you're in those
[00:32] countries you don't have access to the
[00:35] US Stock Market you can't hide from
[00:37] inflation in assets like we can but you
[00:40] can escape through Bitcoin it's really
[00:42] just a matter of meeting people where
[00:43] they are and the way that I would talk
[00:45] to progressives about Bitcoin is a lot
[00:48] different than the way that I would talk
[00:49] to conservatives ultimately all roads
[00:52] generally point back to to
[00:54] [Music]
[00:57] bitcoin you said something interesting
[00:59] you said like there's a marketing
[01:01] problem in in Bitcoin what do you mean
[01:03] by
[01:05] that um I think it's on a lot of fronts
[01:10] um one of them is is I I think there
[01:14] tends to be a immune response from
[01:18] bitcoiners when it comes to anybody that
[01:20] might even be perceptual uh perceptually
[01:23] threatening them and so you know we go
[01:25] after [ __ ] coiners uh we go
[01:28] after um you know people in traditional
[01:31] Finance there's obviously a large uh
[01:34] political battle um that has been going
[01:37] on especially in the prior uh Biden
[01:40] Administration where you've got oper uh
[01:42] operation choke point 2.0 things like
[01:44] that but
[01:46] we're I don't know that we're as
[01:48] welcoming as as we could
[01:50] be um so because when we when we're
[01:53] telling [ __ ] coiners and and and ALT
[01:56] coiners people that are just you know
[01:58] dabbling in other
[02:00] uh cryptocurrencies what we're really
[02:02] saying is is you're an idiot and you
[02:04] don't
[02:06] deserve wealth you don't deserve a
[02:08] better life unless you come over and you
[02:11] know see things our way right
[02:15] um and rather than educate them or try
[02:20] to bring them along and and make it um I
[02:23] don't know just a more welcoming
[02:25] environment I've just never ever seen
[02:28] anything
[02:30] um work where people are insulting
[02:34] people and then saying but come on to
[02:36] our side and so I there's something to
[02:39] that and I I think that there's a lot of
[02:41] people that do a great job uh ly Alden
[02:44] among others um of making it more
[02:49] accessible um but you have to meet
[02:51] people where they are and so for example
[02:54] I think that uh the progressive case for
[02:56] Bitcoin is potentially even stronger
[02:58] than the conservative one one and we can
[03:01] break down these political barriers that
[03:04] are a huge barrier to entry for a lot of
[03:07] people because they see it through
[03:10] political lenses and all these other
[03:11] lenses that exist at the you know fiscal
[03:15] political layer and above and what I
[03:18] think bitcoiners are very attuned to uh
[03:22] is the monetary layer beneath that and
[03:25] we need to do a better job of getting
[03:26] people to understand that layer uh so
[03:29] that they can understand how the
[03:30] problems tend to originate at that layer
[03:33] and bubble up to those so we're dealing
[03:36] with primarily it seems to me the
[03:39] symptoms of problems rather than the
[03:41] root cause and I think that bitcoiners
[03:43] have a great grasp of the root cause of
[03:45] the problem that's super interesting
[03:48] it's and it's actually something that I
[03:51] I talked about when I'm guessed on other
[03:53] podcasts uh and what we can improve in
[03:55] Bitcoin because I think this um mindset
[03:58] of yeah have have fun staying poor uh I
[04:03] I think that I think that's not that's
[04:05] not something good I think we we we
[04:08] should be welcoming and and I think we
[04:10] all as bitcoiners went through a journey
[04:13] of not understanding Bitcoin this
[04:15] missing Bitcoin calling Bitcoin a scam
[04:18] maybe even something worse and then
[04:21] seeing Bitcoin because someone else
[04:23] explained it to us someone else made it
[04:26] understand either directly or through a
[04:28] book or through a podcast or for
[04:30] whatever and and if we just say if we
[04:34] have debates on let's say Twitter and
[04:36] like oh why is that like and and you
[04:38] just say like oh have fun staying poor
[04:40] you end the conversation like you have a
[04:43] very negative connotation to bitcoin all
[04:45] of
[04:46] the exactly yeah it's just not it's not
[04:49] a good message um nobody wants to be
[04:52] insulted and then look at you know
[04:54] whatever else that person's going to say
[04:56] it's just not it's not effective and so
[05:00] um I think that we can do a better
[05:05] job uh as a as a community of providing
[05:08] real education because the problems are
[05:10] very real Bitcoin in my opinion uh is a
[05:15] huge part of the solution to those
[05:18] problems but people lack the
[05:21] understanding and they lack the language
[05:23] to articulate the unfreedom that they
[05:26] feel in our system and I think Bitcoin
[05:30] uh provides that understanding and that
[05:32] language so that
[05:35] they uh can better understand what the
[05:37] problem is and why Bitcoin is a at least
[05:41] a part of the solution to those
[05:44] problems uh very true you said something
[05:47] uh in in the in the middle there with
[05:49] Progressive case and conservative case
[05:51] for for Bitcoin and how you like the
[05:54] progressive I think you said that that
[05:56] you like the progressive case more if I
[05:58] remember correctly um uh are you talking
[06:01] about the overall uh the books because
[06:05] there are two books Progressive case and
[06:06] in conservative case or the overall like
[06:09] what what do you mean by that banking
[06:11] the
[06:12] unbanked you know there's roughly 5.7 PE
[06:16] 5.7 billion people uh in the world that
[06:19] do not have access to Modern banking
[06:23] these are people that live under
[06:25] oppressive
[06:26] regimes um I mean if if you look at at
[06:30] Africa if you look at Central America if
[06:32] you look
[06:33] at um South America uh you look at
[06:36] what's going on in Ukraine you look at
[06:40] all of these areas where there's
[06:42] conflict and there's
[06:46] hyperinflation um Bitcoin is a is the
[06:50] solution to their financial problems the
[06:54] the best thing that many of those people
[06:56] can do and you know sailor others have
[06:58] pointed this out you don't really have a
[07:01] choice to stay in the local currency
[07:04] when you're in
[07:06] Argentina or you're in turkey or you're
[07:09] in all of these areas where the
[07:14] value of your
[07:17] currency completely collapses by you
[07:20] know on a monthly basis yearly it's you
[07:22] don't have an ability
[07:26] to uh take that money with you into the
[07:29] future at least take the value of it um
[07:32] with you into the future and so
[07:35] Bitcoin allows all of us to do
[07:39] that um without being geolock without
[07:44] Capital controls without all these
[07:46] things that prevent people from moving
[07:48] in the world in the way that they
[07:49] otherwise
[07:50] could and um you know I I've seen um
[07:57] stories of people uh women in
[07:58] Afghanistan
[08:01] um where they don't really have property
[08:05] rights but Bitcoin offers
[08:07] it and so if you're in those countries
[08:12] you don't have access to the US Stock
[08:16] Market you can't hide from inflation in
[08:19] assets like we can but you can escape
[08:21] through Bitcoin and um that to me when
[08:26] you can when you look at it you know
[08:28] Jack M's put it so
[08:30] well is is that money is our time and
[08:35] energy in abstracted form and to the
[08:38] degree that all of us work and try to
[08:41] provide value to others if you have a
[08:44] system that is sucking that
[08:48] value out of the money that we're
[08:51] storing they're stealing your time and
[08:53] energy and I just can't think of
[08:55] anything more important than for people
[08:57] living under those circumstances that
[09:01] billions and billions of people
[09:03] are um to get out of that system that is
[09:08] robbing you and move it into Bitcoin
[09:11] where they can't extract it from
[09:14] you um you know that that's it's just
[09:17] such
[09:19] a that to me is just so profound that
[09:22] Bitcoin offers
[09:24] that and that to me is like maybe the
[09:27] biggest story in in Bitcoin is property
[09:31] rights for people that have been denied
[09:35] it for in some cases generations and
[09:38] generations and
[09:40] generations yeah the power that comes
[09:42] with having Bitcoin uh especially for
[09:46] those who can't otherwise protect
[09:49] themselves I mean there in the Western
[09:51] World we have a lot of tools like ETFs
[09:54] and and the stock market and even real
[09:57] estate products and stuff like that
[09:59] where we can
[10:00] actually uh have a protection against uh
[10:04] inflation and against the monetary
[10:06] expansion where others might not even
[10:08] have the access to what that there are
[10:10] more people that potentially have the
[10:13] access to bitcoin that there are people
[10:16] that have a bank account uh so so that
[10:19] that that's just uh tremendous for me
[10:22] what what power Bitcoin could bring to
[10:24] those underprivileged uh
[10:27] communities yeah I mean Alex gladstein
[10:30] makes the case so well too when it comes
[10:33] to you know this marketing problem I'm
[10:36] talking about it's it's really just a
[10:37] matter of meeting people where they are
[10:39] and the way that I would talk to
[10:41] progressives about Bitcoin is a lot
[10:43] different than the way that I would talk
[10:44] to
[10:45] conservatives and the resources that are
[10:48] out there that we can point people
[10:50] to um you know can just better speak
[10:53] their language and then they'll start
[10:56] going down the rabbit hole as as so many
[10:58] of us have uh themselves and um you know
[11:02] for me
[11:05] uh I I thought Bitcoin was just a Ponzi
[11:09] scheme you know I I was like this is a
[11:12] grift I don't you know when when I first
[11:15] started looking into it back in
[11:18] 2016 that's just what I thought because
[11:21] I and I think that's a lot of people's
[11:22] reflexive
[11:23] reaction is there's because I was
[11:25] looking at it like I was looking at a
[11:28] stock you know there's no cash flows
[11:30] here there's nobody like what is this it
[11:33] just seems like an unregistered security
[11:36] that operates like a Ponzi
[11:38] scheme and I think that that's where a
[11:41] lot of us start you know we'll start
[11:43] dabbling other coins and whatever but
[11:46] ultimately all roads generally point
[11:48] back to to
[11:50] bitcoin and the reason for that is
[11:53] Bitcoin because it has no natural
[11:57] issuer because it is void of all these
[12:00] other properties that allow our existing
[12:04] system to suck up value from us whether
[12:08] it's through taxes whether it's through
[12:10] inflation um or you know any number of
[12:15] things that the federal state local
[12:18] governments can do the fact that Bitcoin
[12:20] is outside of that
[12:22] system um becomes so interesting and
[12:26] again when you look at um
[12:29] what it can do for um you know whether
[12:33] it's you know people in America that are
[12:35] dealing with um the
[12:37] basement um that are dealing with
[12:40] getting unbanked I mean I you know
[12:42] listening to Mark andrees talk about all
[12:44] the tech people that got debanked uh
[12:46] during Biden those are real problems and
[12:48] so the none of the other
[12:51] cryptos offer that solution because
[12:53] they're generally centralized they don't
[12:56] have um the properties of of Bitcoin
[12:59] that can actually defend your
[13:01] wealth um and defend your purchasing
[13:04] power um so you know for me for you for
[13:09] for countless others I think that once
[13:10] youve put in the time to to understand
[13:13] that um Bitcoin just emerges as a unique
[13:17] um solution to the problem and again if
[13:20] people want to gamble on these other
[13:22] coins have at it but but Bitcoin uh is
[13:26] the
[13:27] truth how did you come to like uh you
[13:30] said like you you went through uh the
[13:32] the scam phase of like bitco Bitcoin
[13:35] build scheme to to now finding the the
[13:38] signal of of Bitcoin only well I I'll
[13:41] I'll tell you what solidified it I I
[13:43] think that there's probably a lot of
[13:44] details I could go into prior to this
[13:47] but what solidified it was
[13:49] Co um I was in uh Minneapolis at the
[13:54] time and you know we we locked down and
[13:59] me and my wife have the benefit of
[14:02] working from
[14:03] home we have the benefit
[14:06] of uh owning our home we have
[14:10] assets um and we were able to ride that
[14:15] inflation
[14:16] Wave by doing nothing different than we
[14:21] basically already were and when I looked
[14:23] at my friends that have jobs where they
[14:27] have to physically be there
[14:30] um that they could no longer go
[14:33] to many don't have
[14:37] assets um that that to me was
[14:40] heartbreaking and I I went into a mode
[14:44] then um that I I I hope to never enter
[14:47] again but I was just so worried about
[14:50] their um about their financial safety
[14:54] about their health about about all of
[14:56] those things and I felt
[14:59] very
[15:01] guilty um
[15:04] because my net worth was skyrocketing
[15:08] during that time doing what I've been
[15:10] doing
[15:12] anyway because they kept on talking
[15:15] about you know the news during that time
[15:17] I don't know if you remember was all
[15:18] about this k-shaped recovery you
[15:21] remember that and all that is is the the
[15:24] value of the dollar is going straight
[15:27] down which forces asset
[15:30] prices way up and so if you're somebody
[15:33] who is living paycheck to paycheck
[15:35] you're getting screwed and meanwhile all
[15:37] of that all of the
[15:40] value that is in that system is infl I
[15:44] I'm I'm saying that the wrong way but if
[15:47] you have the dollar going down asset
[15:49] prices have to repic up because the
[15:51] denominator itself is losing
[15:53] value most people don't really think
[15:56] about the dollar having to denom
[16:00] minator but you know in practical
[16:02] purposes it does and that's directly
[16:04] influenced by the money supply and
[16:07] interest
[16:08] rates and when those when interest rates
[16:11] collapse and the money supply surges
[16:14] you're going to see asset
[16:16] inflation and so that to me was like I'm
[16:21] not competing any longer in in the
[16:24] market I you
[16:26] know that's just showing in the extremes
[16:30] of what our system is capable of which
[16:33] is we can destroy people that saving
[16:37] dollars we can
[16:39] destroy um and make much more difficult
[16:43] the lives of people that are working
[16:45] paycheck to
[16:47] paycheck that need those dollars now and
[16:49] that do not have the opportunity to
[16:53] invest in assets where they can ride
[16:55] that inflation wave up and so for me
[16:59] Bitcoin was important prior to that but
[17:01] it became a moral and ethical imperative
[17:04] after
[17:05] that it's the the not only it's a it's a
[17:09] good asset to own but it's also an
[17:11] ethical asset a moral asset something
[17:15] that actually makes the the the world
[17:18] better and makes your Ware at the same
[17:21] time which
[17:23] is an amazing com combination that that
[17:26] you can have that in in one as basically
[17:29] yeah yeah AB I mean and that's
[17:32] why it's the I I just treat it so back
[17:35] when I looked at it like I look at you
[17:37] know stocks or you know things like that
[17:41] then yeah it becomes something that it's
[17:43] like okay maybe I'll trade this and I
[17:45] think that's what a lot of people come
[17:46] to bitcoin for it's like I can make some
[17:48] money here I can make some dollars
[17:51] here once you start peeling back those
[17:54] layers of the onion and it does become
[17:57] like it is for so many of us and ethical
[17:58] more imperative it's not something that
[18:00] I'll ever trade it's the only thing I
[18:01] won't
[18:02] trade you know I don't I don't really
[18:04] care about you know the Apple stock and
[18:10] I mean it's just it's not an ethical
[18:11] moral imperative for me so um but
[18:16] Bitcoin is something where you know it
[18:18] is tough um I mean especially in that
[18:21] last cycle writing it from the 60s back
[18:24] down to 30 back up to 69 and back down
[18:27] to 16
[18:30] right I mean
[18:33] that it's not fun but if you really
[18:36] believe in
[18:37] it um and it is an ethical and moral
[18:42] imperative that you do as much as you
[18:45] can uh to
[18:47] educate people about what Bitcoin
[18:51] is um and why it's important and
[18:55] especially if it's on sale maybe it's
[18:58] something you should look at getting
[18:59] even more
[19:00] of um that's what it is to me and so
[19:04] hopefully I'll never have to sell
[19:06] Bitcoin
[19:07] um and just um you know continue to try
[19:12] to educate people on on its benefits
[19:15] what do you think are the implications
[19:17] of of Bitcoin on on society
[19:21] man is there a bigger question um I
[19:25] think it so a couple things I guess one
[19:28] is is is that it
[19:31] offers an
[19:33] alternative that is completely outside
[19:35] the system
[19:37] and I that is
[19:40] important let me try to think about how
[19:42] I want to put this if there's no escape
[19:47] hatch and and there's no other place to
[19:50] put your money you're going to
[19:53] constantly be a victim
[19:56] of um and as Jeff boo puts it like this
[20:00] extractive system that is pulling from
[20:03] you via taxes it's pulling from you via
[20:06] VIA debasement and a variety of other
[20:09] methods and it's also um a release
[20:15] valve where this excess liquidity that
[20:19] hits the economy actually has a place to
[20:23] go to that you know as as sailor puts it
[20:27] um is more thermody dynamically
[20:30] sound right so it doesn't have the
[20:32] leakage that our system
[20:35] does where I used to um I used to have a
[20:39] a rental property um here in
[20:42] Scottdale and I don't know that I'll
[20:45] ever have one again because when you
[20:47] look at how much it just sucks from you
[20:50] you have taxes you have um you know
[20:54] dealing with tenants uh you have
[20:57] replacement of all these like it just
[20:59] offers you a better
[21:01] vehicle without the extraction that is
[21:05] baked into our
[21:06] system and so when you have more Capital
[21:09] moving over into
[21:13] Bitcoin um it is a clear signal to the
[21:18] FED it is a clear signal to
[21:21] politicians that we have an alternative
[21:24] if you continue to [ __ ] with us that ex
[21:27] 12 that and that is maybe the most
[21:32] important component to it is is that
[21:36] even if bitcoin's price stays
[21:38] flat for the next decade it won't but if
[21:42] it were
[21:43] to it's really somewhat
[21:47] immaterial because what would hopefully
[21:50] then be happening is there actually
[21:54] treating and and this is all governments
[21:58] run on Fiat is that they're actually
[22:00] treating their people better to where
[22:02] they might have a little more faith in
[22:04] their own system and their own
[22:06] currencies where they're
[22:08] not taking all of the value that they're
[22:13] providing to that system and moving it
[22:14] out of it because they no longer trust
[22:16] it to me among so many other things
[22:18] Bitcoin is insurance against that makes
[22:21] a lot of sense yeah so we're we
[22:24] have an escape now and and you aren't
[22:29] going to close it you know the the whole
[22:31] this whole uh you know governments will
[22:33] ban it is really only um still talked
[22:37] about by people who haven't done any
[22:39] Research into Bitcoin ab and I mean
[22:42] Putin you know I I I can't remember what
[22:45] conference he was at but he he said who
[22:48] can stop Bitcoin no one and he just
[22:51] laughed you know Putin's a lot of things
[22:52] but he's not
[22:53] dumb
[22:55] and you know that
[22:59] I if the US government could have done
[23:00] something about it they would have and
[23:02] they haven't because they
[23:05] can't and so that's what you know I I
[23:09] remember when when grayscale won its
[23:11] lawsuit that was a very clear signal and
[23:15] the Black Rock ETF filing
[23:17] came I believe immediately after it and
[23:20] that was just the that was capitulation
[23:23] it's we can't do [ __ ] about this so we
[23:25] need to participate in it and that's uh
[23:30] among so many other things uh that Jason
[23:33] Lowry gets into is so interesting is
[23:35] it's not a negotiation so Bitcoin to me
[23:38] is is kind of like the ifsar on we're
[23:41] going to I
[23:42] mean you you [ __ ] around and um you know
[23:47] you're you're gonna find out what is
[23:50] the what is that Lord Lord of the Rings
[23:53] it's
[23:55] so um the way that the way that I look
[23:59] at it is we're keeping watch over you
[24:03] and we're standing here you know that
[24:05] we're here right governments you know
[24:08] that the Bitcoin network is here and we
[24:11] are going to get stronger the
[24:15] more
[24:18] irresponsible and the worse that you
[24:21] treat your people like we're I I'm
[24:24] tripping over my words here a little bit
[24:26] with that but to the degree that you are
[24:30] not treating your people well and
[24:32] respecting the time and energy that they
[24:36] put in
[24:39] to yeah you could go
[24:42] down um to the degree that you aren't
[24:45] respecting your people we're going to be
[24:48] sucking up all of that value out of your
[24:52] system and into our
[24:56] own and so it's just
[25:00] um it's a really powerful message
[25:04] to
[25:06] governments that we're done with you
[25:10] doing whatever you want because we can't
[25:13] escape your financial system
[25:17] and I think that's going to force
[25:19] governments and you're already seeing it
[25:23] to compete for people I mean companies
[25:28] have to compete
[25:30] for you know all of our Capital um and I
[25:35] think it's going to force governments to
[25:38] do the same thing where um
[25:42] maybe they uh will'll have better tax
[25:45] treatments to encourage people to come
[25:47] over there maybe they're going to have a
[25:49] more
[25:50] advantageous um tax Provisions for
[25:54] Bitcoin and they're going to be
[25:56] competing for people by creating
[26:00] the best possible environment for them
[26:03] because they know they have a choice now
[26:06] and that's really important because what
[26:09] Bitcoin does so well is it avoids all
[26:13] capital controls that's that's so
[26:16] amazing and
[26:18] and the thing I think that the the
[26:20] really big one is with with the exit
[26:23] wealth that you also brought up um
[26:26] because now all of a sudden
[26:29] I think the reason why Facebook for
[26:32] example with Mark Zuckerberg is trying
[26:34] to get on the uh we are sensorship
[26:37] resistance and we not Banning people
[26:40] bandwagon uh after did it um it's just
[26:44] because he saw people leaving Twitter uh
[26:47] leaving Facebook to Twitter uh and I
[26:50] also think it's great that we have
[26:52] Nostra so if people leave Twitter for
[26:55] Nostra uh Twitter will reink thing so
[26:59] that that exit wealth is so important to
[27:02] improve the system so in a way uh the US
[27:05] dollar and the Fiat currencies will be
[27:08] in the medium- term better because of
[27:10] Bitcoin because they're like oh like if
[27:12] we print 50% of the money supply this
[27:15] will straight go to bitcoin exactly yeah
[27:19] so I mean the more irresponsible
[27:21] governments are the stronger Bitcoin
[27:23] becomes so what is that going to
[27:24] encourage I mean it's really that simple
[27:27] that's a I think I think in in almost
[27:30] 450 episodes of the podcast now would
[27:33] nobody put it that way actually it's
[27:35] interesting the more responsible that's
[27:38] that's a good way to look at it um yeah
[27:41] just for the people that maybe are
[27:42] curious now about you and and never seen
[27:45] you on other podcasts um what are you
[27:47] doing and what's actually your
[27:49] background yeah so I'm the founder of
[27:51] hot pixel
[27:52] group um I've had it for I think this is
[27:56] the 15th year so so uh what what we do
[28:01] primarily is build uh web platforms for
[28:05] startups um I've worked on a lot of uh
[28:08] digital Transformations for um Fortune
[28:12] 500s um so I've been primarily focused
[28:16] though um in fintech for the last decade
[28:20] so I was the um I was the first
[28:24] engineer um at a uh they were pretty
[28:27] small at the time they're fairly big now
[28:30] um a company called Data site so they I
[28:35] I don't want to get into like what
[28:37] percentage they might handle because I I
[28:38] could be way off now but they handle a
[28:40] vast they they handle a lot of the
[28:43] world's mergers and Acquisitions so when
[28:45] Elon bought uh Twitter that happened on
[28:48] the platform when uh Microsoft bought
[28:51] LinkedIn that happened on the platform
[28:52] and so I I worked for four and a half
[28:54] years building that up with them uh
[28:58] worked a lot with investment bankers um
[29:01] in in those usability studies from JP
[29:03] Morgan Goldman Sachs Etc um and I then
[29:10] uh went over and helped lead a digital
[29:12] transformation out a maror prise
[29:13] financial and it was from that
[29:16] initiative that I'm now serving as a
[29:19] director of engineering for Bond
[29:21] Brokerage in Oklahoma
[29:23] City um we also have our own
[29:26] platforms um
[29:28] so one is for the construction industry
[29:31] called
[29:31] digley shout out to Brent Ramsey my
[29:34] partner he he's he and I have built a
[29:37] lot of things over the years with a lot
[29:39] of other very talented people um and
[29:42] then uh just launched um a Marketplace
[29:46] that's basically the eBay for museums uh
[29:48] with our partners in uh the Museum
[29:52] Industry interesting and eBay for Museum
[29:55] so you can buy atique things for for
[29:59] your
[30:00] Museum well it so yeah the the not to
[30:05] get in too deep into it but um when you
[30:08] look at all of the exhibitions you look
[30:10] at Art um those things have to move
[30:14] around the world if museums keep their
[30:19] contents um static people aren't going
[30:22] to show up to look at the same stuff
[30:24] right so there's a huge
[30:28] Marketplace for that the problem is is
[30:31] that the museums don't know what other
[30:33] museums have and there's an ecosystem
[30:37] that uh exists there it's just there's a
[30:40] lot of friction in it and so what this
[30:44] platform aims to do is to remove that
[30:48] friction but to but primarily I've been
[30:51] involved in uh fintech for like I said
[30:55] about 10 years now I've also consulted
[30:57] with Bitcoin companies and uh the the
[31:00] first one actually they they ended up
[31:02] folding when things went sideways in uh
[31:06] what was that can't remember but
[31:09] 2018 uh and that was my first foray into
[31:12] Consulting with uh Bitcoin companies and
[31:17] so um have some experience there but my
[31:20] expertise lies uh at the uh intersection
[31:25] uh with finance and technology so I'm
[31:27] primarily focused on software
[31:29] engineering and building out teams uh to
[31:32] execute on the goals that startups and
[31:37] uh midcap large cap companies have let's
[31:41] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[31:43] the puty that coin vigilante has made
[31:46] with the Bitcoin watches those watches
[31:49] are the most amazing the most elegent
[31:52] way of showing that you are a true
[31:55] bitcoiner and coin vigilante just
[31:57] dropped the completely new and amazing
[32:00] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:03] collections you have the date of the
[32:05] first ever minded Bitcoin Block in there
[32:08] and of course also the block height and
[32:11] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[32:14] the level of detail they put in in this
[32:17] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[32:20] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[32:23] in the descriptions I love those watches
[32:25] so so much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[32:29] really do hope that you don't have it on
[32:31] Exchange but if you do have it on
[32:33] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[32:35] with that the first way is you put it on
[32:37] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[32:40] you to get into the self- custody game I
[32:44] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[32:46] for that it's a super simple and secure
[32:50] way and if you check out the link in the
[32:52] description you even get 5% off if you
[32:55] use the code Robin and the second way is
[32:57] is the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is
[33:00] your Allin partner in terms of how to
[33:04] get the most out of your sovereignty
[33:07] they will personalize for you a self
[33:09] custody setup that is perfect for your
[33:12] individual situation they will show you
[33:15] how you can secure your own devices
[33:18] securing your Bitcoin is not enough you
[33:20] also have to keep all your devices
[33:22] secure one topic that is overlooked
[33:24] often is the inheritance plan what
[33:27] happens with your Bitcoin once you are
[33:30] no longer here do you have a plan for
[33:33] that in place already and last but not
[33:35] least if you're in jurisdictions where
[33:37] you don't feel safe it's better to get a
[33:39] plan B for all that head over to the
[33:42] Bitcoin way.com
[33:45] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[33:48] just a quick side note I will be for the
[33:51] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[33:54] Prague event in June it will be
[33:56] absolutely leg legendary and I'm really
[33:58] looking forward to seeing all of you
[34:00] there you can get your ticket in the
[34:03] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[34:05] BR and very important use code Robin to
[34:08] get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[34:11] looking forward seeing you there that's
[34:13] super interesting it's also like the the
[34:16] intersection between technology and and
[34:19] finance where where Bitcoin basically
[34:22] makes the most sense if you if you if
[34:23] you look at that what have you learned
[34:25] from the the finte space a lot of them
[34:29] are actually very dismissive what I
[34:32] learned on bitcoin oh they they still
[34:35] are look
[34:37] so um I I don't want to get into any
[34:40] specific details
[34:42] just because it's a client but they work
[34:46] with roughly a thousand banks in the
[34:48] United States those banks are not
[34:51] interested in Bitcoin whatsoever at all
[34:54] their whole model the way that they look
[34:58] at their portfolios is it's all about
[35:00] risk and especially interest rate
[35:03] risk and they cannot take the risks that
[35:07] investment Banks can so the the noise
[35:12] that you
[35:13] hear uh within the trafi community about
[35:19] Bitcoin is really the companies that can
[35:23] afford to explore and uh hold bit coin
[35:29] and they you know they've been working
[35:30] on uh their custody solutions for a long
[35:33] time all the banks are working on that
[35:36] or all the big banks are but that's not
[35:40] a majority of banks in this country
[35:43] there's Credit Unions there's Community
[35:46] Banks there's there's so many banks and
[35:49] if if you were to go there and one of
[35:52] the Brokers were to start pitching them
[35:55] Bitcoin you'd get laughed out of the the
[35:58] bank that's just not where they are they
[36:02] also are many are still so
[36:06] underwater from the fed's actions that
[36:09] started in November 2021 they're still
[36:12] underwater on that and that's why you
[36:14] had the bank term funding program that
[36:16] had to step in which was basically a
[36:17] bailout right so so when you're sitting
[36:21] when you have kind of a front row seat
[36:23] to this and you're seeing
[36:27] the I don't want to call it corruption
[36:29] it's just how it
[36:31] works
[36:33] right is hey we'll just launch a program
[36:36] that's going to last for 12 months and
[36:38] hey you know all those bonds that you
[36:41] bought that are at half their value now
[36:44] don't worry about it because we're not
[36:45] going to Value them at Market we're
[36:47] going to Value them at par which is
[36:49] whatever you paid for them so just take
[36:51] that forward so you and I invest in
[36:54] let's say we invest in some stocks and
[36:57] let's say
[36:58] P the price craters by 50% and the
[37:02] government then comes in and says hey
[37:05] Robin and Harry we see all these big
[37:06] losses you took but you know what
[37:09] they're not really losses we're going to
[37:11] Value them at whatever you bought them
[37:13] and just continue to conduct business as
[37:17] as you would as though that's what the
[37:19] value is does that sound reasonable does
[37:22] that sound fair does that sound like a
[37:25] system that you want to be a part of
[37:27] where where the rules can change at any
[37:29] minute as long as it suits their needs
[37:31] is that egalitarian you know and that
[37:33] that's what people need to pay more
[37:36] attention to Caitlyn
[37:38] long and what she is doing and has been
[37:42] doing with custodia Bank in Wyoming and
[37:45] you know I'm unaware of anybody that has
[37:48] fought harder both for Bitcoin but to to
[37:51] just have a bank that has proper
[37:53] collateral and backing for customer
[37:56] deposits
[37:58] to avoid situations like what we had in
[38:01] ' 0809 which is the Genesis of Bitcoin
[38:05] itself
[38:06] so there's a there's just so many great
[38:09] people that are doing so many good
[38:11] things um in the in the Bitcoin space
[38:15] that I I think that is that's one of the
[38:18] main drivers for the adoption that
[38:22] you're seeing from people that really
[38:25] have a long history in traditional
[38:28] Finance they're the ones who were
[38:30] probably some of the biggest Bitcoin
[38:32] proponents because they understand the
[38:34] problems with this system the
[38:36] most they see the
[38:39] inefficiencies they see I can I can tell
[38:41] you that banks that I've worked
[38:43] with they still operate off of cobalt
[38:46] mainframes in some cases you know these
[38:50] are not there is so much
[38:54] inefficiency in traditional finance that
[38:57] that Bitcoin solves but more than
[39:00] anything it solves the problem of 12
[39:03] unelected chimps printing more money and
[39:07] determining the value of our dollar at
[39:09] any given moment you know who and again
[39:12] I just come back
[39:14] to for me personally that was I mean my
[39:17] experience
[39:19] in early
[39:21] 2020 and all the way through I I
[39:24] mean that to me is like this is just
[39:26] complet wrong you know I didn't you know
[39:29] I I just felt terrible with with what
[39:31] was going on and and having to watch it
[39:34] um I was working with a mror priz
[39:36] financial at the time
[39:38] too and you know being the being a
[39:41] beneficiary I I guess of that
[39:45] system um it just felt gross because
[39:49] we're not competing anymore we're not it
[39:51] just felt wrong so anyways I'm going
[39:53] down some some different tracks here
[39:55] but you know
[39:57] if if you've worked in fintech if you've
[40:00] worked in
[40:02] banking uh and especially the the uh
[40:05] technical uh areas of of
[40:09] trafi and then you see Bitcoin I'm I'm
[40:12] with Jack MERS I think the whole
[40:14] financial system eventually spills out
[40:16] onto the Bitcoin protocol because it's
[40:19] so much more efficient secure and it
[40:22] obviates the need for a lot of the Rails
[40:27] that the world currently operates on and
[40:30] so for and to to put a more precise
[40:33] point on when I fully cut over so Not
[40:36] only was there that in in
[40:38] Co but and I think it
[40:41] was Jack MERS that said this but it made
[40:44] perfect sense to
[40:45] me is is that the internet is an open
[40:49] permissionless protocol for information
[40:52] so HTTP tcip which is what all of my
[40:56] apps sit on it's what all the teams that
[40:59] I've created um it's we don't create a
[41:03] new internet to launch our apps on it
[41:05] there's a reason that AOL
[41:08] died right closed
[41:11] systems do not work as well as
[41:15] open permissionless open source
[41:19] especially systems and so we have an
[41:22] open permissionless protocol for
[41:24] information Bitcoin is just that for
[41:25] money and when I started when I really
[41:29] looked at it that way and stopped
[41:30] looking at it as a stock and this is
[41:33] where the value is so disconnected I
[41:34] mean I'm looking here it's so bitcoin's
[41:36] at
[41:38] 84 the reason bitcoin's so volatile is
[41:41] Imagine pricing what the value of the
[41:43] internet itself is who who knows what
[41:45] the hell that is right but I know it's
[41:49] worth more than all of the tech
[41:51] companies and all the trillions that
[41:53] they have right because they can't
[41:56] operate without it so if the internet
[41:58] had a bar type
[42:01] instrument that moved across its rails
[42:04] just like Bitcoin does on it like we
[42:06] might not need Bitcoin right because
[42:09] we'd already have that capability on
[42:12] HTTP tcip but we don't and so that's
[42:16] what
[42:17] Bitcoin uh represents to me is is that
[42:22] if we're trying to value a protocol not
[42:24] a company and it's the first time that
[42:26] we've ever been able to do it super
[42:27] interesting of of thinking uh like what
[42:30] if the internet the DCP uh protocol had
[42:34] had a native token to it uh where all
[42:36] the values in there naturally the native
[42:39] token has to be created than the value
[42:44] or equal to the value of all the things
[42:47] above it combined uh which is super
[42:51] interesting in in many ways Bitcoin is
[42:54] that native token to the
[42:55] internet yeah I mean it can't function
[42:58] without it
[42:59] right so yeah I mean once you stop
[43:02] looking at it
[43:04] as a stock a company like how how those
[43:08] things are valued and evaluated is
[43:11] completely different than how Bitcoin
[43:15] should be
[43:16] evaluated and
[43:19] Bitcoin is is going to be in price
[43:21] Discovery for a very long time because
[43:24] we just don't
[43:25] know but what we do know is that it's
[43:29] not worth nothing as so many people
[43:33] Proclaim I mean Peter shiff is still out
[43:35] there I I can't believe Peter just keeps
[43:38] going I mean I've never seen anybody
[43:41] look dumber and he just he's he's still
[43:44] at it and just like you know it's going
[43:46] to zero okay but
[43:48] like we value it and therefore it does
[43:52] have value so it's above zero and when I
[43:56] see you know some of the uh price
[43:59] targets out
[44:00] there um they they do seem
[44:04] insane but I wouldn't doubt if we get
[44:06] there because more and more people are
[44:09] beginning to
[44:11] understand the value of being in this
[44:15] alternative system as a hedge against
[44:18] the one that they're in and I don't know
[44:20] of anyone Democrats Republicans it you
[44:23] know it it doesn't matter no one thinks
[44:26] that the existing
[44:29] system is working well even those that
[44:32] benefit from it
[44:33] tremendously because if they're honest
[44:35] with themselves it's just
[44:37] not and and Bitcoin solves a lot of the
[44:41] problems that exist
[44:44] in our traditional Financial system what
[44:48] do you think will what do you think will
[44:50] happen to the traditional like the the
[44:52] Community Banks to to the the CH Banks I
[44:56] personally
[44:57] haven't been to a bank since a very long
[44:59] time I have a bank account to interact
[45:02] with uh the Fiat system but I don't keep
[45:04] any value dge just a a way of
[45:07] communicating with with the with the fat
[45:09] system um if if if more and more people
[45:12] do that like like what happens to all
[45:15] those all those Banks hard to know I
[45:18] mean it's still such early stages I do
[45:21] think it poses a unique opportunity to
[45:24] them uh if they were to start looking at
[45:27] Bitcoin and offering those Services the
[45:30] problem is is that they don't have they
[45:33] still don't really have clear
[45:34] regulations and uh hopefully we can get
[45:37] some of those things done the um the
[45:40] genius act looks really positive for
[45:43] stable coins I think that's going to
[45:45] when people talk about on-ramps and
[45:47] off-ramps from trafi into
[45:51] Bitcoin um one of the things that I
[45:54] think especially if that act is passed
[45:56] where
[45:57] um Banks can start leveraging stable
[46:01] coins is once you're in that system I
[46:04] look at stablecoins being your checking
[46:06] account and Bitcoin being your savings
[46:07] account I think that is a reasonable
[46:12] first step for many of
[46:14] them um how that ultimately impacts them
[46:17] I'm not sure because I I firmly believe
[46:19] in self- custody right which would
[46:21] obviate the need for banks period and
[46:25] so the
[46:27] but when it comes
[46:29] to like I wouldn't have my mom self-
[46:31] custody I I I just wouldn't um and so if
[46:34] a bank is offering Bitcoin custody
[46:37] services for her
[46:39] great and I think that that's where a
[46:41] lot of people will likely end up is you
[46:46] know when you log in to your online
[46:48] Wells Fargo JP Morgan what
[46:51] whatever you you will have checking
[46:53] savings
[46:55] Bitcoin and eventually think all the
[46:57] savings will go to
[46:59] bitcoin and I think to the degree that
[47:03] um people have enough to fund their
[47:06] lives for you know three months out of
[47:09] their checking whatever I think all the
[47:10] rest of that will just end up in Bitcoin
[47:13] um there's problems with that right the
[47:15] whole idea with uh Bitcoin is removing
[47:19] counterparty risk so one of the things
[47:22] that um the bond brokerage some of the
[47:24] board members there that I've talked to
[47:26] about it do get really interested in
[47:28] when it comes to bitcoin is when you say
[47:31] that Bitcoin has no counterparty risk
[47:33] what the hell does that
[47:35] mean because their whole world is
[47:37] counterparty risk and hedging it so what
[47:40] do you mean that there is something that
[47:42] can have counterparty risk that is now
[47:46] making its way into our system I mean
[47:48] they know what's going on with the ETFs
[47:50] they understand all that they maybe they
[47:52] heard about micro strategies you know
[47:55] corporate bonds Etc but this stuff is
[47:57] it's so nent it's so new they they don't
[48:00] they're just not there yet and you also
[48:03] have a big there is a um a major
[48:07] Gap
[48:10] with our understanding of technology and
[48:14] how ambient it is to our life that is
[48:17] not the life of like people that are 60
[48:20] plus that are running these banks that
[48:22] are running these companies it's not
[48:24] that I mean some of these people are
[48:26] going to struggle the
[48:27] attach a PDF to an email you know what I
[48:30] mean like you're going to talk to them
[48:32] about Bitcoin
[48:34] so the the short answer is is I think
[48:37] what's going to
[48:38] happen in in very short
[48:41] order is that for sure there's going to
[48:45] be Bitcoin custody services at
[48:48] Banks like that is
[48:50] underway it's going to happen um I'm not
[48:53] sure who the first one will actually be
[48:55] to where when you go to online check
[48:57] and and you can actually have it there
[48:59] um how they handle that how they handle
[49:00] the transparency around it I think will
[49:02] be
[49:03] interesting um you know are we going to
[49:05] see something like um you know proof of
[49:08] reserves from those Banks I I I don't
[49:10] know but we
[49:12] should and if they can't you shouldn't
[49:15] custody it
[49:16] there so again it to come back to one of
[49:19] your uh questions from minutes ago it's
[49:22] going to
[49:23] force better Behavior it's going to
[49:26] force more transparency institutions are
[49:29] going to need to be less
[49:31] opaque because we have an alternative
[49:34] that is out on a public blockchain that
[49:37] gets audited every 10 minutes how are
[49:39] you going to compete against that you
[49:42] can't right how are you going to compete
[49:45] against
[49:46] it I mean the what you can offer is
[49:50] there's still ux problems around uh
[49:53] self- custody around there's back doors
[49:56] that you know we've we've all heard
[49:58] about there is risk
[50:01] there but those things will get solved
[50:04] and there's a lot of great people
[50:05] working on it you know for for as much
[50:08] flak as I've seen Jack dorsy get for
[50:10] what he did with bit key that solves a
[50:13] major problem and now I saw they just
[50:15] rolled out inheritance another big
[50:17] problem so when you have brilliant
[50:19] people like that working on Technical
[50:22] Solutions to these
[50:24] problems and that community of Engineers
[50:27] is growing there there's so many people
[50:29] in traditional Finance
[50:32] Engineers that are aggressively moving
[50:35] over into
[50:37] Bitcoin that that's another thing is
[50:39] that you have brain
[50:42] drain from traditional Finance into
[50:46] Bitcoin so how are you going to compete
[50:47] with this open
[50:49] protocol I mean good luck that's that's
[50:51] a good point of like who wants to work
[50:54] in a bank these days like
[50:57] like imagine like an 18year old uh and
[51:00] and we're like like what's what's going
[51:02] to what what will I do with my life
[51:04] what's was really my passion like oh
[51:06] like I will work in a Community Bank
[51:08] nothing against Community Banks but like
[51:11] I think the the the the overall Talent
[51:14] like the tech Talent will will they want
[51:18] to work at like a space ax or like
[51:22] working at an open source Proto protocol
[51:24] like Bitcoin and at Community Bank
[51:30] exactly I mean that so just follow the
[51:33] talent and and you can
[51:35] generally see what the trajectory of any
[51:38] industry will be that that and that's
[51:40] there's so many things that Bitcoin has
[51:43] going for it um and I I just I
[51:46] know that many people in traditional
[51:49] Finance are just not they have no idea
[51:52] how far along a lot of this stuff really
[51:54] is and they have no idea how quickly
[51:56] it's going to for them and they're
[51:58] they're just fundamentally like off
[52:00] sides and I get that uh and I I I just
[52:04] it's it's hard for me to even explain
[52:07] how offsides they
[52:08] are like we have
[52:12] an we can all understand that so many
[52:16] Industries have gone through these
[52:17] digital Transformations because there's
[52:19] obvious examples to it and when people
[52:23] talk about
[52:25] dematerializing the physical world and
[52:28] moving that up into um a you know a
[52:32] digital
[52:33] layer that's why we don't have
[52:35] Blockbuster anymore everything's on
[52:38] Netflix that's why we don't have you
[52:41] know so many things just get
[52:44] sublimated and and are made better
[52:46] through Digital Services that can move
[52:48] at the speed of light
[52:50] and but they have they struggle
[52:54] with understanding that about money
[52:56] itself
[52:58] because most people can't answer the
[53:01] question what is money so if you can't
[53:04] answer that
[53:06] question then and you're really like I
[53:08] said originally you're not dealing with
[53:10] the monetary like base layer where all
[53:12] of this starts you're dealing with the
[53:15] fiscal and political layer and every
[53:16] layer on top of and so that base layer
[53:20] because it's so
[53:22] misunderstood they don't understand what
[53:24] it is never mind a digital
[53:26] transformation that is going on with it
[53:28] and it's been underway since Bitcoin
[53:31] launched and it's going to continue to
[53:33] improve it's going to continue to get
[53:35] stronger the use cases are going to be
[53:39] better understood and you also have a
[53:43] situation where I I think it's something
[53:45] like $67
[53:47] trillion that are currently held by
[53:50] Boomers all of that is going to get
[53:52] inherited by a generation that is
[53:54] digitally native you think they're going
[53:56] to invest invest in bonds absolutely
[53:59] not it's
[54:02] so I mean the fact Bitcoin again I'm
[54:05] looking at over the fact that bitcoin's
[54:06] trading at 84 Grand is a joke
[54:09] so and and price isn't all that's
[54:12] important but it is a
[54:14] measure of adoption and we're barely
[54:18] scratching the surface it's a it's it's
[54:20] a a scoreboard of like how how Bad feat
[54:23] is doing and how good Bitcoin is is is
[54:25] getting adopted like those two kind of
[54:27] things are in there so I a lot of people
[54:31] don't like to look at the price but I I
[54:33] think it's actually kind of a unique
[54:36] thing that we have that like imagine
[54:39] Bitcoin without the price it's like the
[54:41] internet you can then you have to I mean
[54:46] say is an amazing example because he
[54:48] wrote about the mobile wave he wrote
[54:50] about the internet and he just bought
[54:52] like uh this apple Microsoft Google all
[54:56] of
[54:56] them uh because in the internet if you
[54:59] want to profit from that you have to buy
[55:01] a basket of of companies to have a
[55:04] representation of of of what the
[55:06] internet value actually is with you can
[55:09] just actually just buy the the base
[55:12] layer bear token and and you're like hey
[55:15] like that if if if Bitcoin network is
[55:18] getting adopted uh by 2x 3x 5x the base
[55:22] layer token will be 2x 3x 5x uh and and
[55:26] that's it's it's a really cool cool way
[55:28] to look at it from a technology
[55:30] standpoint and then it's like then you
[55:33] go deeper and it's like oh like it's my
[55:34] savings technology it's the best asset
[55:36] and stuff like that but just from if
[55:39] you're excited about
[55:40] technology uh and and seeing the Bitcoin
[55:44] network uh as a technology like you have
[55:48] to be excited about the Bas layer token
[55:50] also like the representation of of of
[55:53] how much you can buy and I like to
[55:57] actually denominate Bitcoin not in a fat
[56:00] currency but like in gold or like
[56:04] okay how much of a house does 10 Bitcoin
[56:07] or one Bitcoin buy you like I think
[56:09] that's a more interesting way to to
[56:12] measure the growth of the purchasing
[56:14] power of Bitcoin because when you do it
[56:16] in feat you also have the monetary
[56:18] inflation in there so like I I do think
[56:20] price uh or the growing purchasing power
[56:23] of Bitcoin is a very valuable inside in
[56:27] the adoption but also like there's hash
[56:29] rate there's other things that are
[56:30] really interesting to look at yeah
[56:32] absolutely and and
[56:35] they bitcoiners are used to I mean we
[56:39] all talk about it right like the price
[56:40] of everything is collapsing relative to
[56:42] bitco right but that's just not how most
[56:45] people think about it because they
[56:47] they're still in Dollar denominated
[56:51] World
[56:52] and when you can show them how much
[56:56] the dollar is collapsing against
[56:59] that and then you talk to them about how
[57:03] insane it is to save in that currency so
[57:08] like there's a lot of people that are so
[57:11] fearful the system has instilled so much
[57:14] fear in them that they there's a ton of
[57:17] people I mean I have friends and family
[57:20] members that still store a lot of money
[57:24] just in dollars in a savings account and
[57:27] when you ask them like why are you
[57:29] willing to
[57:31] take best case scenario is the Fed hits
[57:33] its Target of
[57:36] 2% they just took 2% of the value they
[57:39] attached a value vacuum to your savings
[57:42] account and stole 2% of it every year
[57:46] why are you okay with that just why why
[57:48] are you okay with that and and and in Co
[57:53] you know I mean that rate was 10%
[57:56] higher I mean those are official
[57:59] numbers so if you look at things like
[58:01] true flation I mean there's all kinds of
[58:02] other metrics you can look at but you
[58:05] know real estate prices where where I
[58:09] live went up 50% in the span of a couple
[58:12] years that's unbelievable which means
[58:15] that your purchasing power I mean if you
[58:16] were looking to buy a house you were
[58:18] saving up for
[58:20] it it just cost you 50% more in the span
[58:24] of no time at all
[58:26] and had you held assets that could ride
[58:29] that wave or you held Bitcoin which has
[58:32] ritten it better than any of them you'd
[58:34] be in a much better position but they
[58:38] are so fearful and this goes back to my
[58:40] original point is you have to address
[58:43] that fear first
[58:45] because there is no education
[58:48] around money Finance investing like that
[58:52] is not that is not taught in America at
[58:55] least
[58:59] it's it's in most schools unfortunately
[59:02] not not taught the the the fin aspect of
[59:04] it you you kind of have to deal with it
[59:07] yourself yeah you know and and you've
[59:10] got PE I mean you've got people like
[59:12] Dave Ramsey out there who I think is
[59:15] fantastic for people if you're if you're
[59:17] in a lot of debt or whatever he's a
[59:20] great person to listen to to get out of
[59:21] it but once you're at neutral how are
[59:24] you going to make like you have to
[59:26] there is such thing as good debt I mean
[59:28] I I I remember um there was a clip of
[59:30] him that went viral I think with graham
[59:32] Stefan where he's like would you take
[59:33] $100 million
[59:35] 0% 0% interest h100 million you can put
[59:38] it in us treasuries get 5% you're you're
[59:41] making five million a year he's like
[59:43] would you do it he's like no no wouldn't
[59:45] do it and he's just laughing he's like
[59:47] why not he's like I just I don't I don't
[59:49] do debt and it's
[59:51] because you know whatever his past is
[59:54] and his fear of of of that type of debt
[59:57] but he's it's a guaranteed return with
[60:00] no interest won't take it and that is a
[60:03] guy that millions of
[60:05] people listen to for financial advice so
[60:08] it's no and it so it's just no wonder
[60:11] that if if that's the base understanding
[60:14] that you
[60:15] have bitcoin's that much scarier to you
[60:19] and that's what we've got to overcome in
[60:22] when when
[60:23] we um are just answering people's
[60:27] questions about like what Bitcoin is
[60:29] what's the what is the problem and why
[60:32] it's the solution but you've got to deal
[60:35] with some of those things first and
[60:37] people have just been
[60:39] needled with this idea that debt is
[60:42] really bad in any
[60:45] form and that you should be scared of
[60:48] things because the value of them can go
[60:51] down even if the trajectory of it over
[60:55] years is demonstrably up
[60:59] so I I I think that you know we've got
[61:03] to deal with those things uh first when
[61:05] we're when we're talking to people about
[61:07] Bitcoin and I that's what I try to do
[61:09] that's great I I can see that uh you're
[61:13] a great educator um there's one question
[61:15] that I ask each and every one of my
[61:17] guests and the the question is what can
[61:19] we learn from you besides Bitcoin oh man
[61:23] not much um the reason that
[61:27] that I you know I care about technology
[61:29] and the reason that I care about Bitcoin
[61:32] the reason that I do what I do is to is
[61:35] fundamentally just to help people I've
[61:39] um I've just dedicated the better part
[61:42] of 20 years to doing as much as I can
[61:47] for others providing
[61:50] opportunities um for myself
[61:54] but that that's through
[61:58] the um the efforts of others which are
[62:01] all trying to solve problems for people
[62:04] and
[62:05] so I think if you get up every day and
[62:08] you just try to do as much as you can
[62:12] for others you're you're going to help
[62:14] yourself you're going to help your
[62:16] family you're going to help your
[62:19] community if you can do all those things
[62:21] you can maybe help your state and if you
[62:23] can do that you can maybe help your
[62:24] country and
[62:26] um you know I'm I'm just trying to do
[62:29] that in my own small way and uh Bitcoin
[62:33] is just another I think
[62:36] tool um that can help me do that and I
[62:40] hope it can help you know others do the
[62:42] same it has fundamentally changed the
[62:44] way that you know I view the
[62:47] world um and so just try to help others
[62:53] I I think that that's
[62:56] that's all that we should be
[62:58] doing and yeah that's that's me getting
[63:01] really
[63:03] preachy I think it's great to to help
[63:05] others I think it it also ties back
[63:07] perfectly to to how we actually started
[63:09] the podcast of like kindly orange
[63:11] building and not saying have fun staying
[63:13] poor and being helpful to others people
[63:18] yeah
[63:19] um yeah just uh you know I I I post my
[63:24] thoughts um you know on X um you can
[63:28] find me there um and we did by the way I
[63:32] should mention two of um two of my
[63:34] friends here in
[63:36] Scottdale very deep into
[63:38] Bitcoin uh whole family's into it uh we
[63:41] started a community here uh if you're in
[63:45] Phoenix Scottdale uh called Bitcoin
[63:47] Social Club so we're getting that moving
[63:50] we had our first uh
[63:52] event and looking to do a lot really
[63:56] cool I think that uh ties also really
[63:58] good to our end routine where the
[64:00] previous guest is asking a question for
[64:01] the next guest without knowing who the
[64:02] next guest actually is uh and the
[64:05] question from previous guest is what is
[64:08] the most important thing one can do for
[64:10] Bitcoin educate yourself so that you can
[64:13] educate others if they're open to being
[64:16] educated I I think all there is so much
[64:20] information out
[64:21] there and it's hard to digest at all but
[64:25] if you can do
[64:27] that um I don't see how your life won't
[64:30] improve and how you can't improve the
[64:33] lives of others so it's really it's
[64:35] fundamentally
[64:36] education and I I think if you
[64:39] can you know listen to people like ly
[64:43] Alden and and others that are great
[64:45] macro thinkers I think that your life is
[64:47] going to get a lot better um I don't
[64:50] really have a great answer for that but
[64:53] just continue to educate yourself so
[64:55] that you can be knowledgeable if people
[64:56] have questions for
[64:58] you I think that's that's a is a great
[65:01] way to to look at it um thank you so
[65:04] much um Harry for for being on the show
[65:06] before I let you go you already uh
