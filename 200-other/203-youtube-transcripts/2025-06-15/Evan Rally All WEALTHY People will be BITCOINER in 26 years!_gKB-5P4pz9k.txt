[00:00] the people who are the wealthiest who
[00:02] can make the most changes in society in
[00:05] 50 years will all be bitcoiners it was
[00:07] to get rich before now it's to avoid
[00:09] getting poor more people will start to
[00:11] appreciate this ethos of buying quality
[00:13] things of building quality things that
[00:15] last and less of this fast fashion
[00:18] constantly churning through crap there
[00:20] are people now who really don't feel
[00:22] inflation yet because they're super rich
[00:24] and they don't go to a grocery store and
[00:26] they don't care how much it costs but as
[00:28] their wealth gets eroded away they might
[00:30] start paying attention to it you can
[00:31] adopt the Bitcoin standard right now and
[00:33] then all of the sudden inflation is
[00:35] actually your friend and not your enemy
[00:36] this isn't greedy corporations this
[00:38] isn't immigrants coming in and stealing
[00:40] your job this is because they're
[00:42] printing incredible amounts of money
[00:44] every day and debasing your savings if
[00:46] you had the opposite where the prices
[00:48] are going down by 2% every year now it's
[00:51] capital's responsibility to say hey I
[00:53] know we agreed to 100,000 a year but I
[00:55] actually need to lower that and it's
[00:56] okay cuz your costs have gone down as
[00:58] well can we agree to a lower price it
[01:00] flips the relationship and actually
[01:02] makes for more Pro labor Society where
[01:04] the the workers then have the inertia on
[01:07] their side you can't just go around
[01:08] Silicon Valley with a pitch deck and a
[01:10] pretty face and raise $100 million you
[01:13] actually have to provide value for
[01:15] people to jump that hurdle rate of
[01:17] Bitcoin Bitcoin will bring us to True
[01:20] capitalism and not that weird thing we
[01:22] have central banks but everyone calls a
[01:24] capitalism where Capital itself isn't uh
[01:27] free great thing about bitcoiners is we
[01:29] are used to to having our entire frame
[01:31] of reference
[01:32] [Music]
[01:35] smashed uh I will be speaking at Bitcoin
[01:37] ABS them uh probably next week when I
[01:39] publish that uh so we will be together
[01:42] on stage I'm really looking forward to
[01:44] that um let's talk a little bit before
[01:46] we get into your topics with r of
[01:48] Passage and and living in Thailand and
[01:50] other things and and Bitcoin and freedom
[01:52] in general uh let's talk a little bit
[01:54] maybe let's give a little bit of a
[01:55] preview of uh what we might talk about
[01:57] uh next week uh and uh for me it's
[02:01] really interesting when we look at the
[02:03] the topic of where Bitcoin could end up
[02:06] in 2050 what life will live in in 2050
[02:09] especially the the time Horizon of like
[02:13] the next 26 years is a very specific one
[02:16] for me because 26 years a lot of things
[02:20] can happen like most people completely
[02:22] overestimate what like happens in one
[02:24] year but they underestimate what happens
[02:26] in 10 years and they completely
[02:28] underestimate what actually could happen
[02:30] uh in 25 26 years um how do you look at
[02:34] uh Bitcoin development in in 26 years
[02:37] how do you imagine that that hyper bized
[02:41] world and one thing that really got me
[02:43] excited as I went down the the rabbit
[02:45] hole U was actually like it used to be
[02:48] very into uh energy and eco-friendliness
[02:53] and Eco conscious and whatnot and then
[02:56] through Bitcoin I sort of realized that
[02:59] there's n't anything wrong with that
[03:01] like consuming less or being more
[03:03] conscious but the the ways that we are
[03:06] being fed that is often a narrative of
[03:09] control that we're not actually
[03:12] attacking the right problem right the
[03:14] institutions are telling us we need to
[03:16] drive electric cars and use solar panels
[03:18] and whatnot but in a lot of ways those
[03:21] aren't actually solving the problems and
[03:22] some ways they're making it much worse
[03:24] the real problem to me is overc
[03:27] consumption of of things
[03:30] and the complete lack of quality which
[03:33] we don't really like on the surface you
[03:35] don't think of that as associated with
[03:37] Bitcoin but once you're in Bitcoin long
[03:38] enough you meet enough bitcoiners you
[03:40] start to realize there's a there's a
[03:41] correlation between quality and and
[03:45] Bitcoin and people who are interested in
[03:46] Bitcoin they're interested in creating
[03:49] quality things that last for a long time
[03:52] and I'm really excited about that that
[03:56] ethos to sweep through Humanity as
[03:59] Bitcoin grows and grows and I think
[04:02] people will jump on the Bitcoin
[04:03] bandwagon I think the first 10 years
[04:05] were about number go up and that's why
[04:07] people were jumping on the bandwagon now
[04:10] I think it's more about getting out of
[04:13] of debasement it's it was to get rich
[04:16] before now it's to avoid getting poor
[04:18] the people are getting into Bitcoin
[04:19] because they're realizing prices are
[04:21] going up so fast they need to find a
[04:23] Lifeboat and they could go gamble it in
[04:25] the crypto casino but the the most
[04:28] Surefire way is to get into
[04:30] Bitcoin
[04:32] and I think that as more people are
[04:35] adopting Bitcoin more people will start
[04:38] to appreciate this ethos of of quality
[04:41] of buying quality things of building
[04:43] quality things that last and less of
[04:46] this fast fashion constantly churning
[04:49] through crap and I'm excited to buy a
[04:54] dishwasher that lasts for 50 years
[04:57] because that's what I remember growing
[04:59] up with like we had a washing machine
[05:00] from the 880s that just still worked and
[05:03] now you get a washing machine and it
[05:05] dies in like two years because some
[05:07] little Electronic Component goes bad and
[05:09] then lo and behold there's no spare
[05:10] parts there's no one who can fix it you
[05:12] just got to go buy another $500 machine
[05:15] so I'm excited for this return to
[05:17] Quality that I think Bitcoin is going to
[05:19] usher in and that will have I think in
[05:22] turn lots of effects throughout society
[05:26] that will be extremely beneficial I
[05:28] think we'll see less waste we'll see
[05:29] less frivolous spending more people
[05:32] focused on what really matters and what
[05:34] really returns to them and their
[05:36] families and communities which is
[05:39] quality time together building quality
[05:41] things providing value to other people
[05:44] and I don't know really like how I can
[05:47] describe how that might change the world
[05:49] but it will definitely have massive
[05:51] effects and I think that's something
[05:52] that we'll see in the next like maybe 25
[05:55] to 50 years because it's kind of
[05:56] generational as well like I grew up in a
[05:59] F fashioned World a lot of my peers are
[06:03] that's still normal to them to buy
[06:05] clothes all the time and just consume
[06:07] consume consume it's it's totally normal
[06:09] to buy a new car every couple years
[06:10] because the old one is just old uh I
[06:14] think it'll take a generation for these
[06:15] things to kind of smooth out and get
[06:18] carried into the the popular
[06:22] conscience I'm also really excited about
[06:24] the uh generation that is now born like
[06:28] if you think about someone that is right
[06:29] now in 2024 born uh he probably has
[06:33] almost no touch points no real touch
[06:35] points with money the next 15 years
[06:38] because yeah money is just like a really
[06:40] abstruct concept till you're like 15 20
[06:42] years old in most cases especially
[06:45] because your parents take care of your
[06:47] bills you don't you get some pocket
[06:49] money but it's not really the real
[06:52] concept of like oh it's inflation area
[06:54] something like that so when you come to
[06:56] a generation that will have the first
[06:59] touch points with money when they're
[07:01] like 15 20 years old then Bitcoin
[07:04] hopefully is so much developed that they
[07:06] actually live in a kind of a Bitcoin
[07:08] world uh not saying Fiat will be
[07:10] destroyed at that point just like that
[07:12] Bitcoin will be very present at that
[07:13] point um that that is that gives me a
[07:16] lot of hope that we now have a
[07:18] generation that might live in a in a in
[07:21] a Bitcoin focused uh World Bitcoin
[07:23] dominated world really cool also one
[07:25] thing that um stood out to me what you
[07:27] said is not getting pool uh not number
[07:30] go up but uh not getting poor as the
[07:32] main driver and I see it already now
[07:34] where even in Austria where inflation is
[07:36] not that uh bad as in turkey or in
[07:39] Argentina inflation is a topic like
[07:41] people talk about it they don't see the
[07:44] solution with
[07:45] Bitcoin they don't run to bitcoin and I
[07:48] also see in turkey and Argentina they
[07:51] rather go to like an USD stable coin
[07:55] rather go to the US dollar as the next
[07:57] best feeld currency uh and not go that
[08:01] much to the Bitcoin of course in their
[08:03] countries the Bitcoin adoption is higher
[08:05] than in others uh but it it seems like
[08:08] they they rather go to and not as broken
[08:11] feeld currency rather than going to the
[08:14] most broken feeld currency um when will
[08:18] that shift come in the population how
[08:21] high has the pay pain to Beetle like
[08:23] people that actually like oh yeah like
[08:25] maybe I should look into into Bitcoin
[08:26] what will that that adoption barrier
[08:30] break yeah I don't think about this as
[08:33] like one barrier I think it's all on a
[08:35] Continuum like people will marginally
[08:39] adopt Bitcoin as they get pushed out of
[08:41] everything else and as everything else
[08:43] starts to inflate faster and faster and
[08:45] I saw it going back to the US because
[08:47] I've been in in Thailand since 2019 but
[08:50] I went back in 2022 and rode a
[08:52] motorcycle around the country for like
[08:53] three months and that was the first time
[08:56] I heard people really talking about
[08:57] inflation and I had gone down down the
[08:59] Bitcoin rabbit hole before that I
[09:01] understood that inflation is probably a
[09:03] lot higher than the 2% that were build
[09:06] all the time that there's certain
[09:07] sectors of goods that certainly
[09:09] unequivocally have much higher inflation
[09:11] like health care for instance and people
[09:13] had I'd heard people complain about that
[09:15] in the past like especially the US
[09:17] healthc care system is super expensive
[09:19] it's become like a a chronic stressor of
[09:22] Americans I have several friends who
[09:26] hold on I got to kill that oh good
[09:28] several friends who gave up on doing
[09:31] something entrepreneurial because they
[09:33] needed to keep their health insurance
[09:35] which came with their job in the US so
[09:37] they didn't want to start their own job
[09:38] or do what they really wanted to do
[09:40] because they're afraid of losing their
[09:41] health insurance they get in a car crash
[09:43] and now they're in debt for the rest of
[09:44] their lives because that medical bill so
[09:47] I saw it kind of bubbling up in these
[09:48] different areas but and like now for a
[09:50] lot of people people blamed it on
[09:52] something else and I was guilty of this
[09:54] too before I discovered Bitcoin I
[09:56] thought was greedy corporations or
[09:57] whatever somebody is is screwing with
[10:00] prices until I started to really
[10:02] understand how money works so I think
[10:04] it's going to be this gradual process
[10:06] where there are people at different
[10:08] stages of this understanding there are
[10:10] people now who really don't feel
[10:12] inflation yet because they're super rich
[10:14] and they don't go to a grocery store and
[10:16] they don't care how much it costs but as
[10:18] their wealth gets eroded away they might
[10:21] start paying attention to it okay why
[10:23] you know why are there more controls on
[10:25] the other assets that I have there's
[10:27] higher taxes in certain areas how can I
[10:30] escape and and avoid this pain and
[10:33] they'll start coming to bitcoin I think
[10:35] people who are feeling it now in
[10:38] inflation uh at the grocery store
[10:41] they're going to start to realize this
[10:43] is happening everywhere in every good
[10:46] and hopefully they'll see some touch
[10:47] point because of people like you and
[10:50] other content creators that are creating
[10:52] mass media content talking about this
[10:54] that hey this isn't greedy corporations
[10:57] this isn't immigrants coming in stealing
[10:59] your job this is because they're
[11:01] printing incredible amounts of money
[11:03] every day and debasing your savings it's
[11:06] very clear and very simple but people
[11:08] just haven't seen the right thing
[11:10] because of course the the powers that be
[11:12] are not going to tell you that that's
[11:14] that's why it's going up they're going
[11:15] to find a scapegoat for it but more and
[11:17] more it's going to get harder and harder
[11:19] to avoid that fact and once you face
[11:22] that fact you come upon Bitcoin you
[11:24] start to understand that this is a
[11:27] solution and then I think Bitcoin takes
[11:29] levels of trust as well people get in
[11:31] because they're like oh wow all my
[11:32] friends are buying it I'm going to buy
[11:34] it now and then they get wrecked and
[11:36] then they start to understand why did I
[11:37] get wrecked and you know what does this
[11:40] thing actually do what did I buy and
[11:42] some of them get on the train and
[11:45] ultimately I think it's just a survival
[11:46] of the fittest thing like the people who
[11:49] are the wealthiest who can make the most
[11:52] changes in society in 50 years will all
[11:56] be bitcoiners so that ethos will then
[11:59] take over and all the people including
[12:01] the ultra wealthy right now that didn't
[12:04] understand it their fortunes will waste
[12:06] away and so they will have a lot less
[12:09] energy to spend that and I want to say
[12:12] like influence but money is energy right
[12:14] so they can you can make people do
[12:16] things on your behalf by paying them in
[12:18] Bitcoin you can provide value to other
[12:21] people and get value from them so the
[12:23] people that have all that stored value
[12:25] they're going to have the ability to
[12:26] make change to make public campaigns and
[12:29] whatnot and those will all be bitcoiners
[12:31] the people who didn't buy Bitcoin they
[12:33] won't have that that power in the
[12:35] future that's an interesting thing when
[12:38] you think about a world where Bitcoin
[12:40] actually succeeded and then all those
[12:43] people that now have Bitcoin will be
[12:46] kind of the I I don't like the word but
[12:48] the new Elite the new uh powerful people
[12:52] uh but I don't like the word um and and
[12:54] it could have a massive influence on on
[12:57] how we how we do things and this isn't
[12:59] this is an impactful thing that I didn't
[13:01] even even consider too much till now
[13:04] where what not only happens when Bitcoin
[13:07] is is the the main money but what if uh
[13:10] Bitcoin all those early Bitcoin adopters
[13:12] who have now this low time preference
[13:14] already this critical thinking mindset
[13:16] as first principles thinking most of
[13:18] them at least um there are also
[13:21] exceptions in the Bitcoin Community as
[13:22] we all know but most of them have this
[13:25] it's it's it could be a quite cool word
[13:28] one thing that um you spoke about was
[13:30] also interesting for me when we talked
[13:32] about entrepreneurs and and and
[13:35] companies that's I think a common theme
[13:38] that uh I call them Finance Pros in in
[13:41] the in the in the in the traditional
[13:43] Finance space always talk about okay but
[13:46] what if we actually have sound money and
[13:48] then the hurdle rate of of getting
[13:51] entrepreneurial money and and Venture
[13:53] Capital money and credits from the bank
[13:55] and stuff like that is really hard
[13:57] because uh you can just keep your money
[13:59] and money actually um appreci over time
[14:03] so your incentive is not to just invest
[14:05] it too much in the uh in in the company
[14:07] if I have a lot of money uh in Bitcoin
[14:10] and it depreciates slowly over time I
[14:12] don't have the incentive to to gamble it
[14:14] on on some startup but if my money loses
[14:18] like 10 20 30 40% of value and I have a
[14:22] lot of big pile of money I have a big
[14:25] incentive to gamble on like 10 startups
[14:28] uh what do you think think happens when
[14:30] we have Bitcoin as the new hurdle rate
[14:33] um when we have Bitcoin as like this
[14:36] sound money barrier um and maybe even
[14:39] the impact on like zombie companies as I
[14:41] call them companies that are just alive
[14:43] as as there's so much cheap money and
[14:45] they benefit from the credit and rent
[14:47] seeking um what what impact do you think
[14:50] has it on on on companies and and
[14:53] financial
[14:54] side so I I remember in economics class
[14:58] we were taught T about inflation in a
[15:01] curiously like not symmetric way what I
[15:04] mean by that is we were taught that
[15:05] inflation a little bit of inflation is
[15:07] good 2% 3% to push money around to drive
[15:12] investment but a lot of inflation is bad
[15:15] as we know hyperinflation and everything
[15:18] is hard to lie about that a lot of
[15:19] inflation is obviously bad but then on
[15:21] the deflation side we're not taught the
[15:23] same thing we're taught that as soon as
[15:25] you get any deflation you have a death
[15:28] spiral and Everything Burns in the whole
[15:30] world disappears and there's no
[15:32] discussion of like well is it marginal
[15:34] on the other end can we have 2%
[15:36] deflation and that would be a good thing
[15:38] we're just taught never ever go to
[15:39] deflation that's like entering a black
[15:42] hole we have no idea what's on the other
[15:43] side and and that's just Doom for an
[15:46] economy and it's never really discussed
[15:48] again in Orthodox economics that's just
[15:50] taken as fact never ever go to
[15:53] deflation and really you should just
[15:56] mirror it like it's all on a continuum
[15:59] you don't want massive deflation and I
[16:01] don't think Bitcoin would ever really
[16:03] provide that because of how inflation
[16:05] and deflation work which I can get into
[16:07] my theory on that but with a little bit
[16:10] of
[16:11] deflation and with a currency that
[16:14] essentially of inflates a little bit but
[16:16] maybe below the the rise in productivity
[16:19] of the whole society you just have
[16:21] prices slowly coming down so it kind of
[16:24] changes the power dynamics in a couple
[16:26] ways like I think the labor versus
[16:28] Capital debate is a really interesting
[16:30] one that a lot of bitcoiners don't talk
[16:31] about that you have this fight that was
[16:35] really big in like the 70s and 80s my
[16:37] dad was in a a strike right when he
[16:39] joined an airline and he's very pro-
[16:42] labor as a result of this this whole
[16:44] fortive experience and there was this
[16:47] big battle between the the labor unions
[16:49] and the capitalists well the reason that
[16:52] they have to fight is because prices are
[16:55] always going up because the value of
[16:57] that dollar they're being paid in that
[16:59] they're agreed to on their contract is
[17:01] always going down so it's on Labor's
[17:05] responsibility basically to fight to
[17:07] always get higher wages and the way this
[17:09] works in Big Industries they literally
[17:12] negotiate with the the union negotiates
[17:14] with the company for like five or 10
[17:17] years to get a new contract and it's
[17:19] always this huge thing that's really
[17:21] drawn out as a ton of politics and and
[17:24] [ __ ] actually hurts customers in a
[17:26] lot of ways too because the customer or
[17:28] the
[17:29] the company is fighting with the the
[17:31] union and back and forth well if you had
[17:34] the opposite where let's say the the
[17:37] prices are going down by 2% every year
[17:39] going down by some certain amount every
[17:41] year now it's capital's responsibility
[17:44] to say hey I know we agreed to 100,000 a
[17:46] year but I actually need to lower that
[17:49] and it's okay because your costs have
[17:50] gone down as well can we agree to a
[17:52] lower price so it it flips the
[17:54] relationship and actually makes for more
[17:56] Pro labor Society where the the work
[17:58] workers then have the the sort of how do
[18:02] I put it like the inertia on their side
[18:05] that helps them out more than helping
[18:08] out capitalists in my opinion but it
[18:11] also helps capitalists because they can
[18:13] stockpile capital and it will grow over
[18:15] time so I think all these things kind of
[18:17] fall on this this sort of
[18:19] marginal um Continuum where a little bit
[18:23] of an of deflation
[18:26] would kind of be a non non-issue like
[18:29] it's people still need to eat they still
[18:32] want to earn more money than that like
[18:34] it won't wipe out investment to your
[18:37] original point about startups and
[18:39] investing in companies people are not
[18:41] going to hoard their Bitcoin and sit
[18:43] under a tin roof and eat GRL every day
[18:46] just to have more Bitcoin they're still
[18:48] going to enjoy their life like all of us
[18:50] bitcoiners we're still enjoying our
[18:52] lives I still go on vacations I still
[18:54] own chairs you know there's a whole meme
[18:56] of like Get rid of everything but most
[18:59] bitcoiners are not like that most people
[19:00] are not like that but it does subtly
[19:03] change your psychology where you're like
[19:05] do I really need to buy a $500 branded
[19:09] backpack or am I good with a $50 utility
[19:12] backpack that gets the job done that I
[19:13] need it for because you're not just
[19:15] trying to throw money around because
[19:17] it's going to disappear anyway or do I
[19:19] really want to invest in Intel or Apple
[19:22] or Google is that really a company that
[19:24] I want to support or am I just trying to
[19:27] get out of of my melting Ice Cube and
[19:30] put it in something that might hold its
[19:32] value or be a rocket ship so I think it
[19:35] will just reduce this crazy investment
[19:38] like startups like juicero and thonos
[19:41] that were just complete scams it will
[19:43] wipe those out because you can't just go
[19:45] around Silicon Valley with a pitch deck
[19:48] and a pretty face and raise a hundred
[19:50] million you actually have to provide
[19:53] value for people to jump that hurdle
[19:55] rate of Bitcoin which might be two or
[19:57] four or 5%
[19:59] and there will still be people who with
[20:01] a portion of their Capital want to
[20:03] invest it because I might be sitting on
[20:04] a bunch of Bitcoin but I want to go out
[20:07] and try to get five or 10% from a
[20:09] startup as well I maybe I just want to
[20:12] invest in them because I think it's a
[20:13] good idea and I want to help out a
[20:15] friend or family member like there's
[20:17] plenty of other reasons and and
[20:20] motivations for people to make money or
[20:22] to invest in things other than my money
[20:25] is losing value at 2 to 10% a year which
[20:28] is sort of what what the inflation
[20:31] Believers are justifying of trying to
[20:33] say like we need our our money to melt
[20:35] so that people will give it to companies
[20:37] people will still give it to companies
[20:39] yes slightly less so they'll be slightly
[20:42] smarter about who they invest in they'll
[20:44] be some dumb ideas that won't get money
[20:46] there'll be some good ideas I'm sure
[20:48] that won't get money as a result but it
[20:50] will marginally change things it's not
[20:52] like investment's going to disappear
[20:54] because of of Bitcoin I don't think that
[20:57] that makes any sense
[20:59] there are a lot of interesting points
[21:01] this could also erade those crazy boom
[21:04] and bust Cycles uh as we had it in the
[21:07] com bubble and and so many other
[21:10] examples um when the hurdle rate is a
[21:12] little bit up also interesting um I was
[21:15] in stocks before then now I'm completely
[21:18] all in Bitcoin but I already said at
[21:20] some point Bitcoin will hit the maturity
[21:23] level where I might want to go in with
[21:25] like 10 20% of my um capit that are like
[21:29] oh okay let's let's see if there's
[21:30] something really interesting in in on
[21:32] the company side maybe there's something
[21:34] that I want to support or maybe there's
[21:36] something that I see as a a major fuge
[21:40] topic where I want to invest in um right
[21:42] now I don't see anything close to the
[21:45] opportunity that Bitcoin is that
[21:47] probably will not change in next like
[21:48] five 10 years maybe like long longer
[21:50] than that but at some point uh I'm I'm
[21:53] searching for Investments again uh
[21:55] because Bitcoin is at the maturity level
[21:57] and then it makes sense to maybe take
[21:59] like 10 20% or higher than that if you
[22:02] want of your capital and and see if
[22:05] there's something outside of of Bitcoin
[22:08] where you can get some outside returns
[22:10] or just just support something that you
[22:12] really want to support like there
[22:14] there's a lot of interesting U
[22:17] discussion around that also interesting
[22:19] what I found is what you said I never
[22:21] thought about that um what if we have a
[22:24] deflationary system where the employee
[22:28] the employer all of the sudden has to
[22:31] negotiate with the employee to have a
[22:33] lower salary every year now the employee
[22:36] has to go to the company and say like oh
[22:38] please I I want to have a higher salary
[22:41] but what if the the the salary is
[22:43] actually going down over time because
[22:45] purchasing power is is rising that much
[22:47] and if you provide the same value you
[22:50] get a a lower salary every year so you
[22:52] have to like keep up with with that to
[22:55] get the same salary so that's this is an
[22:57] interesting uh perspective I never saw
[22:59] it like that where then all of the
[23:01] sudden the companies have to go to the
[23:04] employees and say like oh sorry we have
[23:07] to negotiate a lower salary uh which is
[23:10] a I think a beautiful thing but um most
[23:12] people have a hard time proba
[23:15] understanding uh why is it the one thing
[23:18] that I want to get a little bit into is
[23:20] also why massive deflation is bad it's I
[23:25] don't fully grasp it because it's like
[23:28] when when we have massive deflation and
[23:31] we let's say we on a Bitcoin standard
[23:32] and we have massive deflation doesn't
[23:35] that mean that uh we are just getting
[23:37] really efficient with producing things
[23:39] and all of the things getting really
[23:41] cheap at at that point just because we
[23:43] getting more efficient in I don't know
[23:45] getting bananas or whatever in that way
[23:48] Bitcoin has a solid value but we're
[23:50] getting better in producing things uh
[23:52] wouldn't that wouldn't massive deflation
[23:55] be an advancement for Humanity
[23:58] yeah I guess that's true like if we're
[24:00] talking you're we're already on a
[24:02] Bitcoin standard then massive deflation
[24:04] is a signal for productivity gains we're
[24:07] seeing huge productivity gains I guess a
[24:11] more nuanced way to say it is rather
[24:14] than inflation and and deflation is
[24:16] predictability I think predictability is
[24:19] important because you have that allows
[24:21] for contracts it allows for interaction
[24:23] between businesses and for planning in
[24:27] for the long term so if you are planning
[24:31] to sell some good at a certain price or
[24:34] whatever for a long time and someone has
[24:36] agreed to then buy it for a long time
[24:38] and now the price is varying a lot
[24:40] somebody's getting screwed on that that
[24:43] end but if you know predictably how
[24:47] prices are generally going to Trend I
[24:49] think that's it's helpful for business
[24:52] planning it's helpful for making
[24:54] contracts but if you know it's if it's
[24:57] if we're on a Bitcoin standard
[24:59] say then yeah having massive deflation
[25:01] is not a big deal it's when it swings a
[25:03] lot I think that then you create
[25:06] problems for business planning for
[25:08] financial planning ah makes sense it's
[25:12] like the unpredictable swings it's even
[25:14] like with inflation it's hard uh I
[25:16] remember I was in Mafia job and and we
[25:20] and and I negotiated a contract deals
[25:22] over like four five years uh and this
[25:26] was a this was really like a hard thing
[25:28] thing to do because basically you are
[25:30] saying like oh we we will provide that
[25:32] service for the next five years and
[25:34] there's a dollar amount and they pay
[25:37] each year how do you know like what if
[25:41] if if we can provide that let's say
[25:43] let's make the numbers easy for $100,000
[25:45] right now this year in 2024 I don't know
[25:48] if I can provide the same service for
[25:52] $100,000 in 5 years from now probably
[25:55] not to be honest and then how do you
[25:57] calculate then inflation how do you make
[25:59] sure there's a contract where you still
[26:01] make profits in five years with that
[26:02] contract it's not a huge liability so
[26:06] exility seems to be uh very important
[26:10] yeah I think it would be like to the
[26:12] labor versus Capital argument it's would
[26:15] play in Labor's favor to have that kind
[26:17] of fiveyear 10-year contract but I think
[26:20] about like an airline if they they plan
[26:22] on rewriting a contract with Pilots
[26:24] every five or 10 years so let's say they
[26:27] write one in 25 and we're on a Bitcoin
[26:29] standard and so prices are slowly going
[26:32] down and they've they've modeled out
[26:34] that they're going to ticket prices are
[26:35] going to go down by 2% every year or
[26:37] whatever but suddenly there's a massive
[26:40] breakthrough in in Airline technology or
[26:44] whatever then and prices come down by
[26:45] 50% per year well that Airline is going
[26:48] to struggle really hard or possibly go
[26:50] bankrupt and now all those people who
[26:52] they might have been cheering like yeah
[26:55] productivity is causing this massive dip
[26:56] in prices but but that that job could be
[27:01] in Jeopardy that whole company could be
[27:03] in Jeopardy if they're not able to then
[27:05] renegotiate the contract with their
[27:07] employees so it's just the surprise
[27:09] element I think that makes long-term
[27:12] business planning more difficult but
[27:15] like we've been saying I think a Bitcoin
[27:16] standard would make those kind of
[27:19] changes a lot less like the boom and bus
[27:22] cycle a lot less extreme and a lot less
[27:25] common because the deflationary side
[27:27] unless maybe we lost like a million
[27:29] Bitcoin all at once publicly and it was
[27:31] proved they were sent to a burned
[27:33] address or something it's a lot easier
[27:35] for the Fiat system to boom and produce
[27:38] trillions of dollars out of nowhere and
[27:40] cause a massive bump in inflation it's
[27:43] harder for us to have a massive increase
[27:45] in productivity I think across sectors
[27:48] that quickly maybe in in one sector you
[27:50] can have a breakthrough that causes a a
[27:52] big productivity increase but it's I
[27:56] think it's less uh sudden and and easy
[28:00] to cause deflationary shocks than
[28:04] inflationary and overall it's it's way
[28:06] better because then the the free market
[28:09] determines the the price and not someone
[28:12] in an office deciding what what how much
[28:14] money we print and how much we doing it
[28:17] that's that's like it's so ridiculous
[28:19] for me that the whole world looks at
[28:20] like one meeting where some random guy
[28:23] comes on the stage and says like what
[28:24] what they cut with the interest rates
[28:26] like that's seems be such an arbitrary
[28:30] thing to do we need a new term for it
[28:32] like it's a pullit bureau it's a we
[28:35] should be using communist terms for this
[28:36] like it's Central planning that's what
[28:38] it is it's we all bow to these seven
[28:41] gods who tell us how to run our lives
[28:43] and they look at a bunch of charts and
[28:45] they know what's best for eight billion
[28:48] people it's just completely Preposterous
[28:50] it didn't work in the Soviet Union it
[28:52] hasn't worked in any socialist or
[28:54] communist country of the many types that
[28:56] have been tried so why would it work in
[28:59] in this way it's just Central planning
[29:01] done over again with new lipstick on the
[29:03] pck if you watch or listen to my podcast
[29:06] on a regular basis I'll guess you
[29:08] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[29:11] most important step is to keep the
[29:13] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[29:16] wallet my personal recommendation for
[29:18] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[29:21] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[29:23] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[29:25] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[29:28] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[29:32] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[29:36] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[29:38] step is to really level up your
[29:40] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[29:43] have the most secure self- custody setup
[29:46] you have to secure your own devices you
[29:49] have to protect your privacy you have to
[29:52] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[29:54] on where you live you even want to have
[29:57] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[29:59] move in case something goes really
[30:01] really wrong and through all those steps
[30:03] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[30:06] step by step and if you visit the
[30:09] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[30:13] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[30:15] out how you can level up your
[30:18] sovereignty and last but not least I
[30:20] have something completely new for you
[30:22] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[30:27] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[30:29] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[30:32] look at that beauty I love it so much
[30:35] coin vigilanti made and perfect Bitcoin
[30:38] watch that's the perfect subtle elegant
[30:41] way to go out there and show that you
[30:43] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:47] Bitcoin only make sure to check out the
[30:49] link in the description for those
[30:51] amazing coin vigilante time pieces those
[30:54] watches are amazing I love them so much
[30:56] it was really hard for me to pick the
[30:58] one that I want to have because there
[31:00] are a lot of great options I went with
[31:03] the new transparency Edition they are
[31:06] all limited so grab yours those will not
[31:09] be available for a long time but there
[31:11] will come new models and new amazing
[31:14] designs along the
[31:15] way yeah uh very very true it's it's
[31:19] like Bitcoin will bring us to True
[31:22] capitalism and not that uh weird thing
[31:25] we have central banks but everyone calls
[31:27] a capitalism where Capital itself isn't
[31:31] uh free uh it's a it's it's an
[31:33] interesting uh interesting time uh what
[31:36] a time to be alive I would say really
[31:38] really interesting yeah very interesting
[31:41] um let's talk about what's on your cap
[31:43] with ride of Passage and tet uh first of
[31:46] all like what is ride of passage for
[31:48] those people who don't know about it so
[31:51] ride of Passage is essentially a tour
[31:53] and Retreat company that I started last
[31:56] year to essentially bring bitcoiners
[31:59] together and help them Bond so the idea
[32:02] is we do really out there trips where we
[32:05] try to go to places and experiences that
[32:07] are very off the tourist beaten path try
[32:10] to connect it to Bitcoin in some way uh
[32:13] and they're usually some kind of
[32:14] Adventure that gets you out of your
[32:16] comfort zone so my concept was to bring
[32:20] these two ideas of travel and tourism
[32:24] together because to me travel is about
[32:27] about getting out of your comfort zone
[32:29] and and kind of breaking your frame for
[32:32] how you see the world but most people
[32:34] that are traveling they're tourist
[32:36] they're tourists so they're going to the
[32:38] trip advisor top 10 they're doing the
[32:40] things that their friends recommended to
[32:42] them or that they read in in New York
[32:44] Times magazine or whatever they're
[32:46] they're doing these things that they
[32:47] think are them traveling but it's
[32:49] actually built in the tourism industry
[32:51] to be exactly what you expect and what
[32:55] doesn't really challenge you very much
[32:57] and doesn't challenge your way of
[32:58] thinking but the great thing about
[33:00] bitcoiners is we are used to having our
[33:02] entire frame of reference smashed
[33:04] because to get Bitcoin you had to smash
[33:06] your entire mainstream understanding of
[33:09] finance and economics at the very least
[33:11] and so I want to do that for people
[33:13] through these travel experiences that go
[33:16] very off the beaten path so what we do
[33:18] right now is mostly motorcycle trips so
[33:20] I'm doing one in November here in
[33:23] Thailand I'm doing another one that is
[33:25] for entrepreneurs not necessarily just B
[33:27] coiners but entrepreneurs to Mastermind
[33:30] and do an adventure together that one
[33:32] still has available seats and that's at
[33:34] the end of November also in Thailand uh
[33:37] and I've done Retreats I just did a
[33:38] retreat for bitcoiners here in shangai
[33:42] so trying to come up with these
[33:43] different concepts uh and different
[33:46] experiences that are really eye-opening
[33:48] and and interesting for people really
[33:50] cool I was open next to it uh the webs
[33:53] so people can actually uh see the little
[33:55] bit uh really cool that that you're
[33:57] doing
[33:58] I love that I think that's um that's one
[34:00] of the things that Bitcoin value the
[34:03] most uh and they want to spend like when
[34:06] I look at what bitcoiners one spend the
[34:08] money on it's high quality uh stuff like
[34:13] high quality food uh high quality
[34:16] experiences high quality whatever it is
[34:19] um it's it's it's that the thing where
[34:21] they actually truly value it and that's
[34:23] my hope as we discussed before uh that
[34:25] when everyone is on a s money standard
[34:28] that everyone as you also discussed in
[34:30] the beginning values uh the high quality
[34:33] things more and not that oh yeah let's
[34:36] let's go on a cheap short trip on on
[34:38] some Trip Advisor thing that we know
[34:40] like oh yeah this thing so it's it's I
[34:44] hope that we actually can enhance that
[34:47] um and you're now also living in in
[34:49] Thailand uh and you're from originally
[34:51] from America uh right yeah I grew up
[34:54] outside of Chicago and then I spent
[34:56] seven years
[34:58] in school and working in Philadelphia in
[35:00] New York and I left New York in the
[35:03] middle of 2019 and came here to Northern
[35:06] Thailand and just fell in love with it
[35:08] and never left so I've been here since
[35:10] late 2019 I stayed the entire pandemic I
[35:13] was based here the whole time the only
[35:15] time I've been outside of Thailand since
[35:17] then for for more than a week or two was
[35:20] going back to the us to do this
[35:22] motorcycle trip I did in 2022 where was
[35:25] kind of the the birth of the ride of
[35:27] Passage really I went to 30 different
[35:29] Bitcoin meetups all over the US road to
[35:31] Harley for like 12,000 miles all over
[35:34] the place I really really cool what was
[35:36] the the trigger for you to to move to to
[35:39] Thailand and and why did you eventually
[35:42] stay there so the the trigger was I was
[35:47] laying in the back of my girlfriend's
[35:49] car and it just hit me like I got to get
[35:52] out of here I'm not happy in the US I
[35:54] want to go somewhere else and do
[35:56] something totally different than what
[35:57] I've doing right now and at the time I
[35:59] was working online I was working remote
[36:01] for uh Bitcoin exchange and they would
[36:04] let me work anywhere in the world so I
[36:06] like [ __ ] it I'm gonna get out of here
[36:08] and just do something that is not being
[36:11] in New York City because that was I'd
[36:13] been there for about three years and it
[36:16] was becoming abundantly clear to me that
[36:18] in no way is New York my kind of place
[36:21] and so I had to get out and the first
[36:24] place I wanted to try was shangai I had
[36:26] been there
[36:28] in 2016 but only for like four or five
[36:30] days on a backpacking trip through
[36:32] southeast Asia but Thailand in general
[36:34] just struck me as like very different
[36:36] from anywhere that I traveled as a kid
[36:39] and so it kind of stuck with me and I
[36:41] thought you know what I'm hearing that
[36:43] this place is like a digital NAD Hub and
[36:44] it's easy to work from a laptop here and
[36:47] you know live a more free life it's
[36:49] lower cost of living especially than New
[36:52] York so I figured let's go try it and I
[36:56] literally bought a plane ticket
[36:58] and flew out here not knowing I knew one
[37:01] knew of one guy that worked in my
[37:04] company and I had no reservations for
[37:07] anything I just showed up and found a
[37:09] hotel on Google Maps and booked it for a
[37:11] week and just kind of felt it out and I
[37:14] stayed for 90 days at first to evaluate
[37:17] it and actually my backup plan was the
[37:20] second place I was going to go is Mexico
[37:21] City and after that was Amsterdam
[37:23] because those those two had struck me as
[37:25] well as like very livable places but I
[37:27] just fell in love with it and then that
[37:29] took me to early 2020 I went back to
[37:34] South America went to Peru in Mexico
[37:36] City for like three four weeks went to
[37:38] Costa Rica for a company Retreat came
[37:42] back here processed the paperwork for a
[37:45] Visa for a one-year Visa left and you
[37:48] have to go out of Thailand to get that
[37:50] Visa so I went to Vietnam picked up the
[37:53] Visa and I left Vietnam when I heard
[37:56] that they were going door to door and
[37:58] temperature checking people and just
[38:00] taking people who had a temperature and
[38:02] nobody knew where they were going and I
[38:04] was like okay I'm going to the airport
[38:05] so I flew to the airport or ran to the
[38:08] airport flew back to Bangkok and got
[38:11] locked in like few days later I think I
[38:14] came back to Bangkok on the 12th the
[38:17] 10th or the 12th or something and they
[38:18] closed the borders like a couple days
[38:20] later and didn't open them again for a
[38:22] year so I was I was locked in and just
[38:25] had to figure it out from there those
[38:26] were crazy times yeah it's also was kind
[38:30] of a weird weird place where there were
[38:33] quite hard rules but like 10 20% of the
[38:37] population did not really follow follow
[38:39] the rules uh and police was not really
[38:43] any way shape or form brutal so like
[38:46] they they kind of like um if you didn't
[38:49] follow the rules in austri it was not
[38:50] that bad uh so it was not uh the best
[38:54] place in the 2020 area to to be but also
[38:58] not the worst place I guess uh it was
[39:00] kind of kind of okay I'm I'm also
[39:02] curious you you traveled what what is
[39:04] said 12,000 miles with with the Harley
[39:07] across Across America and you visited
[39:09] Bitcoin meetups and and other places
[39:11] what did you learn about uh Freedom at
[39:15] uh at that uh trip and how long how long
[39:17] was that trip like this has to be a
[39:19] longer trip yeah it was about 100 days I
[39:22] think like 101 days total that I was on
[39:25] like 13d of a year something like
[39:28] yeah yeah you know it's interesting that
[39:30] you asked the question about freedom
[39:32] because I've been asked a lot about this
[39:34] trip but no one has asked what I've
[39:35] learned about freedom and that was
[39:36] actually probably the most interesting
[39:38] learning that I had especially because I
[39:41] moved to Thailand three years before
[39:43] that and so I kind of got used to
[39:45] Thailand and Thai culture and got to
[39:47] know what Thailand is like and to me
[39:51] what really struck me as far as freedom
[39:54] in the US is
[39:55] how not free people are in the land of
[39:59] Freedom like they I guess not free is
[40:02] not the right way to put it the freedoms
[40:05] in America are probably the best in the
[40:08] world as far as your ability to speak
[40:11] your mind um your earning potential like
[40:15] a lot of people and still a lot of ties
[40:17] will flock to the US to to work there to
[40:20] get the protections of being an American
[40:23] and the benefits of being an American
[40:25] but what I noticed is that people are so
[40:28] generally not everyone and not in
[40:31] Bitcoin meetups but outside of Bitcoin
[40:33] meetups there's so much fear division
[40:36] hatred anxiety that I noticed people
[40:40] much more self-defeating like on that
[40:43] point of Freedom like I moving to
[40:45] Thailand it kind of solidified for me
[40:47] that I believe freedom is mostly in your
[40:50] mind if you believe you have the
[40:53] capacity to be free even if you're in
[40:55] jail or you're object ly not free that
[40:59] will carry you towards freedom because
[41:01] you'll take the actions that you need to
[41:04] to be completely free and I think
[41:05] Bitcoin taught me a lot of that too that
[41:08] these ideas of sovereignty they start
[41:10] with you and your personal actions and
[41:12] you taking responsibility for your own
[41:14] life and cultivating that freedom and
[41:16] what I saw in America is people giving
[41:18] up on that and just crying out for like
[41:21] please somebody help me because I don't
[41:23] know what to do or where to turn and I
[41:26] think that fed a lot of the co hysteria
[41:28] on both sides really people who who were
[41:32] super anti any health advice that they
[41:35] heard because they just follow one guy
[41:38] on Twitter that posts about whatever he
[41:40] reads on the internet and that's the
[41:42] health advice that they follow or
[41:44] they're 100% horse blinders like
[41:47] whatever the who says I'm following it
[41:50] if they want me to inject whatever into
[41:52] my body I'm Yours there wasn't much like
[41:56] critical thinking or personal
[41:59] responsibility being taken that I saw in
[42:01] the US whereas here the attitude like
[42:05] they have a lot less but the people I
[42:08] meet seem much more free because they
[42:12] have what they want and they tend to
[42:16] make peace with that much more than what
[42:19] I saw with Americans like they make
[42:20] peace with the circumstances that
[42:22] they're in and they make the best of it
[42:24] and I did not see that in America I saw
[42:26] people who are are struggling mostly
[42:29] against themselves and that was just
[42:32] strange for the place that I grew up in
[42:34] you know to have that reflected on
[42:37] me that's a interesting learning really
[42:40] cool I I love also how you put it like
[42:42] the change starts with the individual
[42:43] the change starts within you like I I
[42:46] see that all the time when people are
[42:48] now the prices are going up yeah like
[42:50] change starts with you adopt Bitcoin
[42:52] like don't don't wait till the the the
[42:56] EU is adopting a Bitcoin standard this
[42:58] will take a whole lot of
[43:00] time but you can adopt a Bitcoin
[43:03] standard right now and then all of the
[43:04] sudden inflation is actually your friend
[43:06] and not your enemy so like what whatever
[43:09] you you look at like change change
[43:11] starts with you starts with with you as
[43:14] an individual and I love that uh that
[43:18] that Insight also from you that the
[43:20] America is the best place for freedom
[43:23] but it seems like the the people don't
[43:25] feel that free because they always want
[43:27] more and and this is like this
[43:28] unsatisfaction
[43:30] mindset it's it's an interesting concept
[43:33] to look at there by the way the the the
[43:36] whole credits for the questions nowadays
[43:39] goes to CH like they they're
[43:41] really it's it's it's really good in
[43:44] finding good questions I do a podcast
[43:46] today so I was trying to figure out how
[43:48] can I be the most efficient in in
[43:50] finding out what the Gest is all about
[43:53] and it's scary like you can really di in
[43:56] like I made own gbd for that uh and it's
[43:59] trained to do exactly that I just put in
[44:02] the name of the guest and it finds me
[44:05] every information that I need and then
[44:08] proposes topics and questions and
[44:10] they're really thoughtful and really
[44:11] good and I probably would need at least
[44:15] like three to four research hours for
[44:18] every guest to come up with a
[44:21] similar set of preparation like the
[44:24] questions are still from me but the
[44:26] preparation to the question is is
[44:28] massive like because like I do a podcast
[44:30] every day I cannot research every guest
[44:32] for like three hours that's just
[44:34] impossible for me time wise but yeah
[44:36] like th those things is just amazing
[44:38] because uh they list like oh you have
[44:40] been traveling that far you have been
[44:42] meeting on so many things and then yeah
[44:45] it's just an obvious question to ask but
[44:47] yeah a lot of the the credit I have to
[44:49] go that's cool yeah it's really good at
[44:52] that kind of thing like any sort of
[44:54] brainstorming if you try and get precise
[44:56] answers it's terrible terrible but it's
[44:58] terrible it's very fluffy but doing
[45:00] brainstorming or getting ideas like I've
[45:02] used it for questions before like kind
[45:05] of doing that research for a
[45:07] conversation it's really good for
[45:09] that even for trips uh I found it was
[45:12] really interesting if you like just want
[45:14] to find like something like oh I I have
[45:18] like free weekend there what are my
[45:20] options I'm here and then it lists like
[45:22] 20 options for you and you're like oh
[45:24] give me another 20 options and it just
[45:26] like expands your my a little bit uh as
[45:28] you would really like have to ask a lot
[45:31] of people or like research a lot like it
[45:33] takes up the the first research portion
[45:37] but I think what's dangerous is if we
[45:40] then use it to like decide our lives
[45:42] like we we should not uh use it to make
[45:46] decisions for us we should uh use it to
[45:49] help us uh in gathering information the
[45:52] same way as we use Google uh the the
[45:55] jump from not having Google to Google is
[45:58] for me the same jump from like having
[45:59] Google to now jbt it's it's just like a
[46:03] a better way to to find and gather
[46:05] information uh and not make decisions
[46:08] based on that the critical thinking is
[46:10] it's really critical really cool uh
[46:12] thank you already so much um perfect
[46:15] then uh I I I try to ask that every once
[46:18] in a while did I forget anything to ask
[46:21] you what you're doing and what you're
[46:23] believing in uh otherwise I will just
[46:25] move on to the end routine no I think we
[46:27] we covered pretty much everything really
[46:30] cool and by the way uh not that I forget
[46:33] to to mention it uh as I mentioned I
[46:35] think in the beginning uh we will be
[46:37] both speaking in Bitcoin Amsterdam I'm
[46:39] really looking forward to the talk uh
[46:41] and uh I'm I'm also looking forward
[46:44] every time because I'm not that much on
[46:46] on conferences uh but every time I'm
[46:48] there it's it's just a pleasure to to
[46:50] talk to all the guests that have been on
[46:52] the podcast to all the people listening
[46:53] to the podcast finally meeting in person
[46:55] so I'm really looking forward also
[46:57] meeting some of my audience there and
[46:59] the guests um uh I'm quite pumped about
[47:02] that conference it's also the first
[47:04] conference that actually moderating a
[47:06] panel I lo LED our talk already so it
[47:08] will be a will be a really cool talk
[47:11] there yeah it's going to be fun perfect
[47:14] then first question of the end routin is
[47:15] always the same for every guest what can
[47:17] we learn from you besides all the things
[47:20] that we already talked about in the
[47:21] podcast boy I guess one thing that I'd
[47:24] like
[47:25] to try to share people or try to share
[47:28] my passion for is just to let your fears
[47:32] and anxieties down and this is something
[47:34] that I know because I've dealt with it
[47:36] so much and had to come up with so many
[47:39] ways around it but like I get asked all
[47:41] the time especially about moving to
[47:43] Thailand like how how could you do that
[47:45] like I I could never do that people say
[47:47] that and I think that's the first
[47:49] mistake a lot of people make and that
[47:50] part of that self-defeat is just saying
[47:53] I can't do it well you don't know until
[47:55] you've you've tried or you've taken a
[47:57] couple steps so that's the first thing
[47:59] it's like it's not impossible to do what
[48:01] you want to do you should never tell
[48:03] yourself that try and figure out what
[48:06] you need to do to get there my dad
[48:08] always told me when I was a kid that
[48:10] really stuck with me is if there's a
[48:12] will there's a way and I kind of thought
[48:14] it was cheesy when I was a kid but now I
[48:17] 100% believe that if there's a will
[48:18] there's a way uh I moved to Thailand by
[48:22] buying a plane ticket then finding where
[48:23] I was going to stay then getting a
[48:24] scooter then getting a co-working space
[48:26] is like everything happens in steps you
[48:29] don't have to have all the answers
[48:30] before you start building a business is
[48:33] even is like that to a thousand you have
[48:37] no idea what you're doing at the start
[48:38] and nobody does like you shouldn't
[48:40] expect yourself to know but you have to
[48:42] put one foot in front of the other you
[48:44] can't run a marathon by jumping to the
[48:46] end you have to you know take each step
[48:49] on that path uh I don't know that's just
[48:52] a a theme that I try to harp on and in
[48:55] every podcast and every speaking
[48:57] situation where we're talking about
[48:58] anything serious I I I love to um uh
[49:02] addition that a little bit uh I think
[49:05] with with the podcast story it's really
[49:07] cool because I when I started it it was
[49:09] just a weird thing that I did on the
[49:10] side I was like oh okay let's let's
[49:12] interview some some people and then just
[49:15] like two months in I got the first
[49:17] sponsor and they approached me and I was
[49:20] like I can make money with that and then
[49:23] all of the sudden YouTube also was
[49:24] monetized all of the sudden Twitter was
[49:25] monetized it's all had happened in one
[49:27] month uh and then I was like okay I get
[49:31] money from that now so I guess I have a
[49:35] startup even though I did not really had
[49:37] one or wanted one uh and then yeah I was
[49:39] like okay let's let's jump for it like I
[49:41] quit my Fe shop that was paying good and
[49:45] was treating me good and my colleagues
[49:46] were amazing and so like it was not easy
[49:49] because uh the F job was quite good
[49:51] honestly it was like most people are
[49:54] like really disgusted with the Fe jop
[49:56] but I wasn't I actually liked it I like
[49:58] liked going there so that's the the the
[50:01] decision to like just leave that and and
[50:02] jump into something that I don't know
[50:04] was was a big one uh but I loved it so
[50:07] much like my goal was to till the end of
[50:10] the year interview Michael sailor and I
[50:12] had it like in June or something like
[50:13] that uh just a few months in the podcast
[50:17] uh I had it no plan that I will be a
[50:20] moderator on a panel uh this year I had
[50:22] it on the plan for next year it happened
[50:24] before like the approach me like hey do
[50:26] you want to be moderating a panel uh so
[50:29] like I think if if you just do what you
[50:31] really want to do and just like go for
[50:33] for what feels good and I'm not fearful
[50:36] and do a lot of that like put a lot of
[50:39] energy and work and and and energy
[50:41] towards that and not just like lazy
[50:44] trying to like oh I like it let's let's
[50:46] figure it
[50:47] out not not take it as an excuse to to
[50:50] to watch Netflix all all day and then I
[50:53] think a lot of interesting things can
[50:55] happen and I love that you you brought
[50:56] it up gave me a possibility to also
[50:59] bring that story in the podcast really I
[51:00] really thank for that yeah I just a
[51:03] quick note on that I think when I
[51:06] was was like growing up I thought that
[51:09] starting a business like you had to know
[51:11] how to do it and know all the ins and
[51:14] outs of accounting and all this stuff
[51:16] and I think for certain types of
[51:18] businesses that's still very true a lot
[51:19] of physical businesses because you have
[51:21] to put a bunch of capital into it to buy
[51:23] a store or whatever you kind of got to
[51:25] know what you're doing know somebody who
[51:27] you can work with who knows what they're
[51:29] doing with regulation and accounting and
[51:32] payroll and all this stuff but something
[51:34] like a podcast or even like what I'm
[51:36] doing I before the internet and before
[51:39] all the tools that came on the internet
[51:41] in the last 10 years maybe this would
[51:44] have been 10 hundred times more
[51:46] difficult but I have a Squarespace
[51:48] website I use email I use Google meet
[51:52] Google Docs Google Sheets and a cell
[51:55] phone and that's how I run all this
[51:57] stuff and now you really can do that you
[52:00] can have a couple social accounts and a
[52:03] couple software tools for 50 bucks a
[52:06] month that's probably what it cost me to
[52:08] to run the actual infrastructure of ride
[52:10] of passage on top of that is all the
[52:12] research and the time I put into it but
[52:14] the actual infrastructure is not that
[52:16] expensive you can take it bite by bite
[52:19] whereas 20 years ago you had to go buy a
[52:23] fleet of motorbikes buy a store and like
[52:26] really build out the infrastructure
[52:28] before you could accept a single paying
[52:30] customer it's so much easier to do these
[52:32] things more uh in a more agile way where
[52:36] exactly like you said just follow your
[52:38] passion and see if people are resonating
[52:40] with it and learn and and pivot and have
[52:43] some failures without losing too much
[52:46] and eventually you'll find a good path
[52:49] and then comes adding in all that other
[52:51] stuff creating an entity and learning
[52:53] the legal and you know all the stuff
[52:55] that you need to add on top of that
[52:58] that's crazy yeah like never looked at
[53:00] it like that because the infrastructure
[53:02] is really cheap to run it's probably
[53:04] like I also have like maybe $150 a month
[53:07] for all the software tools that I use as
[53:10] as it's a lot these days but it's like
[53:13] almost nothing compared to what you need
[53:16] otherwise uh to to run something like
[53:18] that and the other things is like like
[53:20] microphone and lights but you can do it
[53:22] with your phone also like you don't need
[53:23] a microphone for that uh I started with
[53:26] a phone also it's it's it's really
[53:28] fascinating the time that we are alive
[53:29] and then we also have sound money uh
[53:32] future Pride really cool perfect then uh
[53:34] other end routine is where the previous
[53:36] guest is asking a question for the next
[53:38] guest without knowing who the next guest
[53:39] is and I can't believe that that that
[53:43] question uh actually got to you um
[53:46] because it's just uh yeah it's I think
[53:49] sometimes people believe that I select
[53:52] the questions myself but I actually just
[53:54] get it from the last guest and get it to
[53:56] the the next guest but the question is
[53:57] for you what has been the best Bitcoin
[53:59] conference you have been so far on and
[54:01] why I think like especially when we talk
[54:04] about we we going to bitcoin Amsterdam
[54:07] and you have been on so many Bitcoin
[54:08] mediums and stuff like that you're
[54:09] perfect guest for
[54:11] that okay so this might be specific to
[54:15] me and my life and my experience but I
[54:19] love the Thailand Bitcoin conference
[54:21] it's not really well known on the
[54:23] international stage I think this year
[54:25] they didn't do that much promotion
[54:27] internationally because it's mostly
[54:30] attended by ties what I love about it
[54:33] they did it once last year it was one
[54:35] day and this year was two two days and
[54:38] it was yeah like two weeks ago or 10
[54:40] days ago that I was there and what I
[54:43] love so much about it is they created
[54:46] content in Thai language for Thai people
[54:50] and I
[54:51] remember last year I didn't really know
[54:54] what to expect and I showed up and like
[54:56] maybe I think there were 800 or 900
[54:59] tickets sold and they had planned to
[55:01] sell 200 so they had to keep opening
[55:03] more and more and more and when I got
[55:06] there I realized like there's maybe 1502
[55:09] 200 foreigners here foreigners living in
[55:11] Thailand but also like people from
[55:13] Southeast Asia that came into Thailand
[55:15] for the trip for the conference and the
[55:18] rest were like mostly middle AG Thai
[55:21] people who are like trying to figure out
[55:23] what is this thing and they weren't as
[55:25] far as I could tell like [ __ ] coiners or
[55:28] Ico promoter kind of people they were
[55:31] like professional Thai people that were
[55:34] interested in how Bitcoin Works they
[55:35] wanted to learn about mining they wanted
[55:37] to learn about the market and exchanges
[55:39] and everything and this year I saw that
[55:42] there really is a a vibrant Bitcoin
[55:45] Community here of Thai people it's just
[55:47] not well known because everything they
[55:50] do is very Thai like it's all in Thai
[55:53] language they have a Discord of like
[55:55] 5,000 thousand plus people that are
[55:58] talking about Bitcoin all day long all
[56:00] different aspects of it there's channels
[56:01] for everything imaginable imagine I
[56:05] don't know the word for that but
[56:06] anything you can imagine along with
[56:07] Bitcoin there's like Fiat food as a
[56:09] channel in there it's like it's you
[56:12] would recognize it as a Bitcoin or
[56:14] outside of Thailand but it's all in Thai
[56:16] it's all for Thai people and I think a
[56:19] lot of that we have to thank this
[56:20] company right shift and the founder of
[56:22] it Korea who created a lot of YouTube
[56:25] videos did basically exactly what you
[56:28] did like a lot of interviews and a lot
[56:29] of just him talking to the camera about
[56:31] Bitcoin and different aspects of it he
[56:33] helped translate the Bitcoin standard
[56:36] and the Fiat standard which are now
[56:37] bestselling books in Thailand into Thai
[56:41] and created all this content and it's
[56:43] just a mass this massive following of
[56:46] Thai people that I don't think would
[56:48] have got into Bitcoin if they had only
[56:50] read English content there's certainly a
[56:52] lot of ties that can read English
[56:54] content uh but especially when you get
[56:56] into Bitcoin it gets very technical and
[56:57] whatnot it's better to have it in tie
[57:00] and I I just love that conference
[57:01] because it brings out that tie Community
[57:05] into one place and you get to meet ties
[57:07] that are also really down the Bitcoin
[57:09] rabbit hole and you might have had
[57:11] nothing else in common or ever come
[57:13] across this person but now you have
[57:15] Bitcoin really really cool uh I just
[57:17] checked it out uh next to it uh and
[57:20] there was like just like a few I think
[57:22] two or three people that I actually know
[57:24] from the speakers it's like it'ss seems
[57:26] to be really Thai focused laugh like
[57:30] once I once I'm in Thai but they're only
[57:33] speaking Thai so as someone that doesn't
[57:35] know only knows English they cannot
[57:38] understand it right so the last year it
[57:41] was mostly English content this year it
[57:43] was like 5050 like I did a talk and it
[57:46] was all in English but they have live
[57:48] translation so they have it it worked
[57:51] kind of on and off depending on who the
[57:53] speaker was and how clearly or how
[57:55] quickly they spoke but they had live
[57:58] translation from Thai back into English
[58:00] and from English into Thai so you really
[58:01] could attend all of it whether you only
[58:03] spoke one language or the other really
[58:05] cool yeah thank thank you yeah
[58:07] thailander definitely want to check it
[58:09] out uh at some point so maybe I will
[58:11] overlay out with the the the Tha
[58:14] conference I think September it was this
[58:16] year right yeah I don't know if they're
[58:18] going to do it next year though I think
[58:20] like they're kind of trading around with
[58:23] the other Southeast Asian countes so
[58:25] maybe Vietnam or I know Indonesia is
[58:28] going to do theirs next year they took
[58:29] this year off so they're kind of hopping
[58:32] around so I may be at Indonesia next
[58:34] year yeah let's see really cool thank
