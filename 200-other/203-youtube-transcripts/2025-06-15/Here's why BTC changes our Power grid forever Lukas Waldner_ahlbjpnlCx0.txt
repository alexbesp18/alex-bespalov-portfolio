[00:00] Bitcoin will make the energy markets
[00:01] more efficient and the energy Market
[00:04] will need Bitcoin in the future why
[00:06] should you mine Bitcoin while heating
[00:09] many cases it's the cheapest possibility
[00:11] to heat up your home you would only need
[00:13] 6 million households worldwide to reach
[00:15] the whole Bitcoin hash rate if Bitcoin
[00:16] does not make sense every energy that we
[00:19] consume with Bitcoin is a wasted energy
[00:21] and if Bitcoin actually makes sense then
[00:23] no energy that we put in Bitcoin is
[00:25] actually wases directly after graduating
[00:27] from school I entered the Bitcoin only
[00:29] space when you just work all day with
[00:31] bitcoiners like can cannot imagine that
[00:34] you are not becoming a bitcoiner
[00:39] yourself and you're extremely young and
[00:41] already have founded a Bitcoin company
[00:43] it's I love to see it yeah I have
[00:46] actually worked the the whole time in my
[00:49] life in a Bitcoin only job so directly
[00:52] after graduating from school I entered
[00:54] the Bitcoin only space and now I also
[00:57] have co-founded the company 21 energy
[01:00] and yes it was a wild right the last
[01:02] years amazing I feel so many young
[01:05] people uh uh is are seduced by
[01:09] cryptocurrencies by all the
[01:11] shitcoins why didn't you go to any
[01:13] altcoins why didn't you go to any other
[01:16] group to currencies why did you stick
[01:18] from the starting to to bitcoin or did
[01:20] you stick from the starting to bitcoin
[01:22] yes so I think it was like a few months
[01:25] uh I was focusing a bit uh beside
[01:27] Bitcoin on other altcoins uh and then I
[01:31] yeah realized I was yeah focusing more
[01:33] and more on bitcoin and then I just got
[01:36] the right connections and S the right
[01:38] radios and then yeah I just focused from
[01:43] from that point on I just focused on on
[01:45] bitcoin only and bitco only catched me
[01:48] and I went down the rabbit
[01:49] hole this is I I did not thought about
[01:52] uh that before but I just uh it's in my
[01:55] head right now because um when we have
[01:57] now a new generation that is kind of
[02:00] growing up with Bitcoin because myself
[02:03] I'm 25 years old I started buying
[02:07] Bitcoin when I was 21 years old uh with
[02:10] 21 you're you're kind of like starting
[02:12] out to actually uh have anything in life
[02:15] like before 21 like you have a little
[02:17] bit of school you don't really do
[02:19] anything uh you probably party too much
[02:22] so like I started with like 1920 to take
[02:25] my life serious and right on the start
[02:28] when I end the serious life and enter
[02:31] the professional life I came across
[02:34] Bitcoin and this changed my life but it
[02:36] kind of like changed it because I like I
[02:37] started in the right path um which gives
[02:41] me the feeling like this will this will
[02:43] change a whole generation how do how do
[02:45] you think this this could trigger down
[02:47] in in in society when like people really
[02:50] get to bitcoin and don't know anything
[02:52] else like there are people um are now 14
[02:55] years old and they always LIF where
[02:59] Bitcoin was was already
[03:01] there yeah I think so Bitcoin is a
[03:04] Bitcoin is a new industry and it offers
[03:07] is it offers you many possibilities and
[03:11] yeah just many possibilities to to start
[03:13] something on your own and not to to go
[03:15] the The Classical way so going to
[03:17] University and studying for some years
[03:19] or something else um so in the Bitcoin
[03:22] space you it makes you easier just to
[03:24] start off and try your own thing uh so
[03:27] it's just a yeah because of it's a new
[03:29] industry
[03:30] and yeah not too much big companies and
[03:33] uh yeah you can just start off and yeah
[03:37] I know uh some other guys as well who
[03:39] just went to school or maybe studied
[03:42] some years or some months and then just
[03:44] said okay know I want to to to go to the
[03:47] Bitcoin space and try something on my
[03:49] own and the most people I know it worked
[03:52] out well and they're doing good in the
[03:54] Bitcoin space and yeah so I love to see
[03:56] this when other guys do it as well
[03:58] amazing and you know started a company
[04:01] where you can mine Bitcoin while heating
[04:03] your space is it only heating or also
[04:05] cooling or other things no so far only
[04:09] heating but uh yeah we prob thinking
[04:12] forward to to cooling as well but
[04:14] cooling is a bit more difficult and
[04:16] complicated uh so first of all we are
[04:18] only focusing on on heating but yeah who
[04:21] knows I think in in five years or in
[04:23] three years we will probably also
[04:25] develop cooling systems because when you
[04:28] could can can heat in with winter and
[04:30] cool in summer you have the killer
[04:33] feature amazing uh and the obvious
[04:35] question is now like why should you mine
[04:38] Bitcoin and while heating is it like uh
[04:42] more energy efficient to do that or do
[04:46] do you get more stocious with
[04:48] that yeah so the thing is the thing is
[04:51] and also the the reason why we started
[04:54] is uh all the people need to heat up
[04:57] their houses anyway uh so it doesn't
[05:00] matter um and everyone needs heat and
[05:03] wants a fine warm home and all
[05:06] the as well there are a lot of data
[05:08] centers in the world and a lot of hash
[05:11] rate and other data centers for big
[05:13] company like Amazon Google and so on and
[05:16] so the data centers are there anyway and
[05:18] the houses need to to produce the the
[05:21] need to heat up the houses anyway and
[05:23] that was the the reason why we thought
[05:25] okay why not combining these two things
[05:27] and combining the Heat and the the data
[05:30] centers and bring the data centers
[05:32] directly to the homes and so that was
[05:34] the first thing we the first thing we
[05:36] thought of and yeah it's running good
[05:38] and it's pretty interesting uh because
[05:40] you can use the the the energy uh two
[05:43] dimensionally so on one time you can use
[05:46] it in Bitcoin related for hashing and
[05:48] another time for heating and yeah if you
[05:51] put the the if you use something like a
[05:53] space hea which is our main product you
[05:56] have efficiency of 100% so 100% of the
[05:59] electrical energy gets converted into
[06:00] heat because the energy could not get
[06:02] lost and you mind Bitcoin the same time
[06:05] and in many cases it's the cheapest uh
[06:08] possibility to heat up your home so it
[06:10] pretty much depends on your electricity
[06:11] costs and on your gas and oil costs but
[06:13] in many countries it's pretty
[06:16] interesting do you think that's the I
[06:19] saw a lot of like I had a lot of debates
[06:21] already on the podcast where like what's
[06:23] the future of of Bitcoin mining there a
[06:25] lot of B bits like oh Bitcoin mining is
[06:27] too centralized and like what if we when
[06:30] everyone has a solar panel or something
[06:31] like that on the house then we can mine
[06:33] Bitcoin on that with the excess energy
[06:35] because maybe the the sun is too much
[06:37] then we don't have to store it we can
[06:38] just store it not in like a battery we
[06:41] can store it in in Bitcoin when there's
[06:43] access energy from the Sun um do you
[06:45] feel like the the the future is where
[06:48] like in many devices or like in almost
[06:50] all devices there's a small Bitcoin
[06:52] minor in there I had a crazy guy on like
[06:55] I think two podcasts ago he said like
[06:57] Bitcoin mining will uh Capt almost all
[07:00] of the electricity because we have so
[07:02] much Access Energy at some point that
[07:07] humans don't need that much energy and
[07:09] everything else will Ed for Bitcoin
[07:11] mining because that's the most
[07:12] profitable thing to do uh do you also
[07:14] see the the future in in that
[07:17] direction yes definitely so I think
[07:20] nowadays the the Bitcoin mining is quite
[07:22] centralized and yes for us bitcoiners it
[07:25] would be great if it is more
[07:26] decentralized uh but we also would we
[07:29] also like to to talk with the with the
[07:30] normal guys with the with the people who
[07:33] not dedicate theel with Bitcoin yet and
[07:36] if it makes sense for them for economic
[07:39] reasons um yeah it's pretty interesting
[07:41] for them as well and then these they
[07:44] decentralize the network as well so we
[07:46] think that the Bitcoin mining will
[07:47] decentralize in the future more and more
[07:49] but not just because the the Bitcoin is
[07:51] say okay we need to to run a minor at
[07:53] home to decentralize the network just
[07:55] due to economic reasons because there's
[07:57] so much places uh at Earth so at one at
[08:00] one time the the individuals at homes H
[08:03] but also in the in the production for
[08:04] many companies which need a lot of heat
[08:07] um so there's a lot of heat needed um um
[08:11] in many places and yes all these heat
[08:14] could be produced by by Bitcoin Miners
[08:16] and you can just uh use Bitcoin mining
[08:18] chips there and you are more efficient
[08:20] because you can use the heat at one
[08:22] point and at the other point you're Hing
[08:24] at the same time the second thing you
[08:26] mentioned the excess energy that's
[08:28] another big thing uh so yeah we think
[08:31] that the Bitcoin mining will shift more
[08:32] and more to the places uh where either
[08:34] the heat is used or either really um
[08:37] yeah too much excess energies here and
[08:41] yeah but might as well uh in the next
[08:43] years I think um we we shift more more
[08:46] to these places yeah it's interesting
[08:48] also like when you see big energy
[08:51] producers who have a lot of energy and
[08:53] sometimes you have to pay to offload the
[08:56] excess energy because they have too much
[08:58] and then they have to pay someone was
[08:59] like why don't you just like put a
[09:01] Bitcoin m in there don't pay someone El
[09:04] to take your energy and mine Bitcoin and
[09:06] actually get money from that it's it's
[09:08] it's fascinating for me that they still
[09:10] don't uh get still don't get it yeah no
[09:14] definitely so you you would only need
[09:16] six million households worldwide uh to
[09:19] to reach the whole Bitcoin hash rate so
[09:22] uh if six million households uh would
[09:24] have a minor with about let's or a few
[09:26] miners with about 100 teres uh and about
[09:29] yeah then let's say 2 to 3 kilow uh you
[09:32] would uh we would have the the complete
[09:34] Bitcoin hash rate worldwide so it's not
[09:37] too much and uh we could definitely do
[09:40] it and another interesting thing is um
[09:43] that the worldwide primary energy usage
[09:46] uh so the half of the worldwide primary
[09:49] energy usage is used for heat and that's
[09:52] about I think 67,000 ter ter a year and
[09:56] the Bitcoin mining only uses about 5
[09:59] tatt hours per year so yeah there's a
[10:03] lot of upside potential in the next
[10:06] years and I think there Bitcoin can
[10:09] could use much more energy and it's
[10:12] nothing bad because it just produces the
[10:14] heat which is you need it
[10:17] anyway so you use the heat that the
[10:20] miner gives off naturally uh to heat the
[10:24] space basically and that's more energy
[10:26] efficient because if you have like a
[10:27] heater and a separate bit Miner uh then
[10:31] the heater needs the full elect full
[10:33] electricity and when you combine that
[10:35] you're you're more efficient than the
[10:37] stand right yes exactly so there we up
[10:41] there for sure many places on earthway
[10:44] it makes sense to to to mine to mine
[10:47] anyway and just to for using excess
[10:50] energy or for flag mining or things like
[10:52] that we see in the US now uh but I think
[10:55] the mining will more and more shift to
[10:56] the places where the the heat is used
[10:58] really cool and just uh quick that
[11:01] people can understand how how does this
[11:03] work on on like a practical level do
[11:05] they just plug in the the heater and
[11:07] then they set up some some Bitcoin
[11:09] wallet and then they automatically get
[11:10] it like once a week or like every day or
[11:12] like how does this work yes so more less
[11:16] um so the the the the big thing was for
[11:18] us uh to to to get the Bitcoin miners uh
[11:22] pretty pretty quiet because normally a
[11:24] Bitcoin Min is quite loud so I think
[11:26] most of the people in the Bitcoin space
[11:28] have at least seen a video of a Bitcoin
[11:30] miner of or big mining farm and yeah
[11:33] it's pretty pretty noisy and you can't
[11:35] just put it in your living room so the
[11:37] big hurdle for us was to to to to make
[11:40] them quiet with special cooling ribs
[11:42] with special fans and things like that
[11:44] and on the second part to to make it as
[11:47] easy and as convenient as possible for
[11:48] the client H to set it up to set it up
[11:52] and yeah we have now developed an own
[11:54] app for the iOS and Play Store and more
[11:56] or less it's just you plug in the socket
[11:58] uh you download the app uh you connect
[12:01] your mobile phone to the to the heater
[12:03] so there's a microcontroller inside and
[12:05] then you connect the microcontroller to
[12:06] your Wi-Fi at home and so the The Miner
[12:09] inside more or less gets internet and it
[12:12] starts Hing and then in the last step
[12:15] you just uh need to set up a mining pool
[12:17] account so in the Bitcoin mining it's so
[12:19] it's like playing Lottery and it's
[12:21] pretty pretty difficult to to find a
[12:23] valid block if you do just solo mining
[12:26] so you compete against all the the
[12:28] people worldwide so your chances would
[12:31] be like 1 to 6 million every 10 minutes
[12:34] and so it's easier to to get yourself a
[12:36] mining pool account and just choose a
[12:39] mining pool and when then try to to find
[12:41] the Val block with many other people and
[12:43] each time the the mining pool uh finds a
[12:46] finds a valid block you get your rewards
[12:48] and it pretty much depends on the on the
[12:51] size or of the percentage of the of the
[12:53] mining pool uh but yeah it's like daily
[12:56] or at least weekly and yeah but in the
[12:58] end it doesn't matter if you get your
[13:00] rewards daily or your rewards weekly uh
[13:03] it's the same than weekly just the
[13:05] amount is
[13:06] higher cool and uh when
[13:09] you like I had a different question but
[13:11] when you look at the Bitcoin mining
[13:13] pools um do you think that it's a danger
[13:18] to have those mining pools because they
[13:20] are getting the system more centralized
[13:23] or is that uh no danger yeah yes it's
[13:26] for sure a danger um but it's also
[13:29] difficult so uh for sure the the the big
[13:33] miners the big us listed companies will
[13:36] always choose the the cheapest mining
[13:38] pools and not the yeah maybe some better
[13:41] older mining pools and yeah I think
[13:44] that's the the reason why uh many people
[13:46] are going to the to the big mining pools
[13:48] uh but we are mainly using brains and
[13:51] recommending brains for example so
[13:52] brains is the the oldest mining pool uh
[13:55] and I think that the mining pool which
[13:57] has Min the most Bitcoins ever and I
[13:59] think other mining pools won't be able
[14:01] to to achieve that uh because they're
[14:04] yeah just just too much coins coins
[14:06] rewarded in the the last years H the
[14:09] other brain these are very pretty nice
[14:11] guys they are from check from BR um and
[14:13] we are a lot of in we are all the time
[14:17] in touch with them and talk with them
[14:18] and yeah so we support the brain poool
[14:21] and yeah probably we and our clients can
[14:23] shift the the hch rate a bit more to the
[14:25] smaller and better mining pools
[14:29] ah cool cool cool um and uh the the
[14:32] thing that probably a lot of people will
[14:34] ask in the question in the comment
[14:35] section if if I don't ask it how many
[14:37] Sates can I can I get a day on average
[14:40] when I when I put in mining heater yes
[14:45] yeah actually I don't even know that the
[14:47] exact amount of satoshis so we are more
[14:49] calculating in fear terms uh so more
[14:52] calculating in their rewards per
[14:54] kilowatt hour uh but it's just like the
[14:56] the same uh with with the the normal
[14:59] classic mining machines so we are mostly
[15:01] using s9k Pros in our in our heating
[15:05] systems and s9k Pros currently they are
[15:08] something yeah I think 13 cent per
[15:11] kilowatt hour and before the having it
[15:14] was like 22 cents per kilowatt hour and
[15:17] now it moved down a bit but I think yeah
[15:19] if the Bitcoin price will go up and will
[15:21] have a bull run uh it will be much more
[15:23] again but yeah we are more calculating
[15:25] and also on our website we are more
[15:27] calculating with the with the fear terms
[15:29] because it's just more reachable for
[15:31] most of our clients and yeah nowadays
[15:34] many of our clients clients are still
[15:36] bitcoiners as well and yeah Bitcoin is
[15:38] are a great Target group but we want to
[15:40] reach the the the people beside Bitcoin
[15:42] as well and yeah just show them okay
[15:44] Bitcoin can can help you as well a bit
[15:47] and Bitcoin is nothing bad Bitcoin
[15:49] doesn't boil the oceans Bitcoin just can
[15:51] just help to heat up your home more
[15:54] efficient this this argument still comes
[15:56] up I feel like oh Bitcoin is boiling the
[15:58] ocean like it's fascinating for me how
[16:01] how long this this this thing comes
[16:03] around and there was uh who who are the
[16:07] organizations who make um this anti
[16:09] Bitcoin with the Bitcoin Pros to made
[16:12] and advertisement again I forgot the
[16:14] name yeah it was just the the
[16:19] Japanese was it Japanese no I don't know
[16:22] really uh popular the guy behind is Alex
[16:25] def from the from the from the Central
[16:28] Bank in in the Netherlands and I think
[16:30] he did the calculations and then there
[16:32] was the how to say the the print the
[16:35] printing paper which did the oh Green
[16:37] Piece I mean the the Green Piece thing
[16:39] okay uh where where they released the
[16:42] new ad again with like hey Bitcoin
[16:44] Bros yeah yeah Green be does a lot
[16:48] against against Bitcoin but they I think
[16:51] mostly financed by Ripple and ripple
[16:54] just say okay we don't like Bitcoin we
[16:56] want to to become the number one and and
[16:59] yeah that was the reason why Green P is
[17:02] so much against Bitcoin but I think
[17:04] these these narratives are shifting more
[17:06] and more as well uh because I think now
[17:08] the all the other cryptocurrencies and
[17:10] the altcoin see oh okay Bitcoin is well
[17:13] regulated in the in the US as commodity
[17:15] and it would be interesting for us as
[17:17] well so it is probably better to to yeah
[17:20] to try to be together with Bitcoin and
[17:24] yeah to to work with Bitcoin together
[17:27] and not to be against them because
[17:29] Bitcoin is yeah has done a big step and
[17:31] we need to done it in we need to to do
[17:33] it in the future and so it could be
[17:35] easier for us and Bitcoin even like
[17:38] promotes and this is why I don't get why
[17:40] like green parties are not for it
[17:42] because it promotes renewable energy
[17:45] right yeah yeah definitely so yeah I
[17:48] think yeah for us uh we cannot
[17:52] understand why there's still so much
[17:54] companies and so much big organizations
[17:56] organizations against Bitcoin uh but but
[17:59] we at 21g just say okay we want to show
[18:01] these real uh use cases real practically
[18:05] use cases uh for example with heating so
[18:08] when you need to heat up your house
[18:09] anyway it doesn't matter if you heat up
[18:11] your house with and yeah just a normal
[18:14] Electric electrical radiator or if you
[18:16] use a Bitcoin minor the electricity
[18:19] consumption is just the
[18:20] same and I think this those are the
[18:23] arguments and the examples uh that we
[18:25] have to give like we have to really make
[18:27] it uh
[18:29] touchable we really have to put it on
[18:31] the ground like oh that's that's how
[18:33] Bitcoin is actually good for it and and
[18:36] like that do do you have an because
[18:38] you're working in in Bitcoin and energy
[18:39] so like probably you you get that ask a
[18:42] lot do you have like already like a
[18:43] small elevator pitch for the for the for
[18:46] the question like oh but I heard Bitcoin
[18:48] is bad for an environment isn't that so
[18:50] like do you already
[18:52] have short elevator pitch that you
[18:54] usually give to to people that don't
[18:56] have
[18:57] Bitcoin yeah so the best thing uh when
[19:00] we have our heating devices with us is
[19:01] just to to show up to show up the
[19:03] heating devices and show them ah yes
[19:05] that's a Bitcoin minor and the Bitcoin
[19:06] miner is nothing bad it mines Bitcoin
[19:09] but it just heat up heats up your home
[19:11] and you need to heat up your home anyway
[19:13] and then many people understand it
[19:14] because if you just tell them something
[19:17] okay these facts and facts and yeah
[19:18] Bitcoin is CO2 negative because it uses
[19:22] the flare gas for example it is
[19:25] sometimes it's too far away in their
[19:26] heads and so we made experience that
[19:29] it's easier for many people just ex
[19:32] especially for older people just to show
[19:34] them a heating device and say okay this
[19:36] is a Bitcoin miner and it mines Bitcoin
[19:38] it's nothing bad it just heat UPS your
[19:40] heats up your home and you would do you
[19:43] would do it
[19:44] anyway yeah and I think this is it's a
[19:47] great way to do it uh and and just show
[19:49] them like oh it's it's it's a good thing
[19:51] Bitcoin money is nothing bad you don't
[19:53] have to be scared of it uh and I feel
[19:56] like uh most of the people
[19:59] just don't understand why Bitcoin is
[20:01] important and I I usually always uh try
[20:04] to shift the conversation from away from
[20:07] like oh Bitcoin consumes so much energy
[20:08] do like why do we do Bitcoin in the
[20:11] first place like like why does make
[20:13] Bitcoin sense because if Bitcoin does
[20:15] not make sense every uh energy that we
[20:18] consume uh with Bitcoin is a wasted
[20:21] energy and if Bitcoin actually makes
[20:23] sense then no energy that we put in
[20:26] Bitcoin is actually wasted so I I
[20:29] usually try to like really Ste it pay
[20:31] like oh but let's figure out like if
[20:33] Bitcoin makes sense or not and and put
[20:35] it in that direction I feel like when
[20:37] people actually understand the value of
[20:38] Bitcoin uh and and what it does and then
[20:41] we when we compare it to the banking
[20:43] system when we compare to other things
[20:44] then it makes more sense but first bitco
[20:47] first people have to to get what Bitcoin
[20:49] actually is and and not like oh yeah
[20:52] those numbers and that and that's the
[20:54] future and this and that like they are
[20:56] probably overwhelmed but that I think at
[20:59] least yeah definitely so we made the
[21:02] same experience just with the with the
[21:04] other thing I mentioned before uh that
[21:07] yeah Bitcoin the people need to need to
[21:10] to say or need to understand okay
[21:12] Bitcoin does make sense uh but on the
[21:16] other hand we we just showed them okay
[21:18] uh you you would you would need up your
[21:21] home anyway and you could do it with
[21:22] Bitcoin man said well Bitcoin could
[21:25] Bitcoin couldn't be bad because if you
[21:27] use electric radiator or Bitcoin minor
[21:29] there's no difference and yeah so for us
[21:32] it was yeah is mostly going this way but
[21:35] your argument is definitely to 400% true
[21:38] the people need to understand at least a
[21:40] bit okay Bitcoin is valuable and we need
[21:42] Bitcoin and yeah then it's the the
[21:45] heating system or the yeah heating with
[21:47] Bitcoin is even more uh yeah even more
[21:50] better even better for them thank you
[21:52] you already made it halfway through the
[21:53] video and I'm really really grateful to
[21:56] have you here two things make this
[21:58] channel possible you as a watcher and
[22:00] listener who keep supporting this
[22:02] Channel and another one is all the
[22:04] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[22:07] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[22:09] very start and where I personally buy my
[22:11] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[22:13] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[22:15] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[22:19] simplest and securest way to secure your
[22:22] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[22:24] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[22:27] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[22:29] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[22:33] 2% bracket and if you have self custody
[22:35] and you know your friend does not have
[22:37] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[22:39] he needs a birth present and a small
[22:41] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[22:43] 5% off your order plus you support my
[22:47] channel and now let's get back to the
[22:49] video uh I I can understand that the
[22:51] channel populars because uh they they
[22:53] only hear like oh Bitcoin is just used
[22:55] for criminals uh and it's highly vol
[22:59] and then oh it also uses more energy
[23:01] than Austria like it's like you hear all
[23:03] those things and this is the only thing
[23:05] that you hear from Bitcoin then you're
[23:07] like oh yeah that's actually bad
[23:08] for environment right when we can just
[23:10] turn it off then it would be better uh
[23:12] and and that's like I think we just have
[23:15] to like push out and and get the
[23:17] education out and that's why I also do
[23:18] the podcast now every day uh because I
[23:21] hope just like with every video I at
[23:23] least get one guy or one girl in there
[23:26] that sees the video like oh okay Bitcoin
[23:28] is actually that and and 99% of the
[23:30] audience probably already has Bitcoin or
[23:33] is interested in Bitcoin that watches my
[23:34] stuff but I hope that there's like this
[23:36] 1% uh people in there like oh let let me
[23:39] see that that Bitcoin thing today um
[23:42] another topic and I kind of kind of
[23:44] related to that but uh do you think uh
[23:47] that that Bitcoin will will will change
[23:50] the the energy Market in a sense where
[23:54] uh energy will be we covered it a little
[23:56] bit before where energy is is abundant
[23:59] because all of the sudden we can produce
[24:01] big energy facilities in in the middle
[24:04] of the desert and it makes sense because
[24:06] we don't have to transport the energy
[24:08] from there we don't have to store it and
[24:10] usually when we have to store it and
[24:11] transport the energy then it's like uh a
[24:14] lot gets lost and that's why a lot of
[24:16] projects don't get built but when you
[24:18] can build those uh plants and build
[24:20] those facilities and just turn on the
[24:22] Bitcoin miner uh till someone buys at
[24:25] energy like it makes sense from day one
[24:28] uh and I think terahash is is is doing
[24:30] some some stuff with that at least I
[24:32] heard them talking about that uh how do
[24:34] you think like on a broader scale
[24:37] Bitcoin could like influence the energy
[24:39] market and influence energy
[24:42] producers yeah definitely so uh I think
[24:45] Bitcoin will make the the energy markets
[24:47] more efficient and the energy Market
[24:50] will need Bitcoin in the future because
[24:52] if we will shift more and more to
[24:54] renewable energies it will be yeah more
[24:57] more difficult in the future in the next
[24:58] years uh to stabilize the grid and so
[25:02] Bitcoin mining I think can can can do a
[25:04] huge part and we already seeing this in
[25:06] the in America uh where many or yeah
[25:09] some miners are doing demand response
[25:11] programs uh for example with the grd in
[25:13] Texas but we do not have too or I do not
[25:15] have too much insights in the US we more
[25:18] focusing on Europe and yeah we are
[25:20] focusing on on these things in Europe
[25:22] and we are trying to to bring Bitcoin
[25:23] mining more and more and more to Europe
[25:26] and we working quite close together with
[25:28] ter has on some yeah bigger projects for
[25:30] balancing power and yeah these are
[25:32] pretty interesting projects and yeah the
[25:34] the big companies or the El electricity
[25:36] providers and energy companies uh being
[25:39] more and more open to talk about Bitcoin
[25:42] and probably they see ah okay yes
[25:45] Bitcoin maybe it could help us a bit in
[25:47] in some ways and why not uh yeah why
[25:50] should we not just talk about or at
[25:52] least uh discuss a bit uh about the
[25:54] topic and see in some calculations maybe
[25:57] it makes sense maybe not or to start
[25:59] some little projects but I think in in
[26:01] the next five years or the next 10 years
[26:03] uh I think bitco will influence the
[26:05] energy Market especially in Europe quite
[26:08] a lot because so Germany uh yeah shut
[26:11] down the the nuclear energy and if you
[26:13] want to to use only solar and wind they
[26:17] will need to to build yeah big uh big
[26:21] solar panels and big solar farms and
[26:23] especially for the win as well so in
[26:25] Austria it's a bit better because in
[26:26] Austria we have a bit a bit of hydro
[26:28] power so especially in in in the west of
[26:31] Austria in Tyro because we live in the
[26:33] Alps in the in the mountains so it's
[26:35] easier but when you just have hydro H
[26:38] winded solar it's more difficult to
[26:41] stabilize the git and yeah then Bitcoin
[26:43] could be yeah a big thing uh to to use
[26:46] it I love that example from from Texas
[26:49] and and I researched it deeply and and I
[26:52] think I covered it on one podcast really
[26:54] in depth with like two three guests uh
[26:57] and I love that examples just like when
[26:59] when the miners actually work together
[27:03] uh with the energy grid and with the
[27:05] government to like stabilize the grid
[27:07] when there's a lot of energy like let's
[27:09] just turn back the energy miners then
[27:11] they get credits for that for turning it
[27:13] off then they can when there's not much
[27:16] use they can stabilize it again like
[27:17] there's a lot of uh great things
[27:19] happening and what you also said with
[27:21] the European Bitcoin Community I think
[27:23] it's it's really uh uh great to point
[27:26] out because I think we have a really
[27:28] cool Bitcoin community in Europe but the
[27:31] disadvantage that Europeans have against
[27:35] American bitcoiners the Americans have
[27:37] like pretty much one language they all
[27:39] speak like English uh and Europeans like
[27:42] there's German there Spanish there
[27:44] stouch there are so many different
[27:45] languages and most uh going ahead and
[27:48] making the content in their local
[27:50] language uh and not in English so most
[27:52] of the really good uh and uh Bitcoin
[27:55] content creators and the voices in
[27:57] Bitcoin in never heard because it's not
[27:59] English and that's also like what I try
[28:01] to do like push everyone on on podcast
[28:04] and like give them a voice in Europe in
[28:06] English so the world stage can can hear
[28:08] those great voices yeah it's a great
[28:11] thing so I think that especially the
[28:12] German speaking community so I don't
[28:15] know too much about the French or the
[28:16] Spanish speaking uh but the German
[28:19] speaking Community is a pretty good one
[28:21] and I think in Germany there are yeah
[28:24] it's the quite the same amount of full
[28:26] notes like in America in has three times
[28:29] the amount or four times the amount of
[28:30] people of Germany so I think the German
[28:33] community is quite a good one and they
[28:35] yeah pretty big Community movements with
[28:38] meetups and things like that
[28:39] conferences and yeah I think the Germans
[28:42] are doing a good job and yeah Vienna is
[28:44] also you're from Vienna important center
[28:47] for the Austrian economics and so
[28:50] Bitcoin and Austria Bitcoin the German
[28:52] speaking countries are well fitting
[28:54] together yeah it's a some of my comments
[28:57] already like I have to make an Vienna
[29:00] video where I explain about a economics
[29:02] or some old buildings and beautiful
[29:04] buildings from from Vienna I'm usually
[29:07] not that kind of a content creator to go
[29:09] through the city and make that kind of
[29:10] content but I might actually of your
[29:14] podcast yeah I I rather prefer the the
[29:18] podcast still now but as you said like
[29:21] you said it right now I don't know about
[29:23] the French or Spanish community and
[29:25] that's the that's the thing because the
[29:27] Americans know about all the other
[29:29] American communities uh that are uh uh
[29:32] spread out but the Germans only know
[29:34] about the international English speaking
[29:36] ones and the German one because they
[29:38] don't understand Spanish or French and
[29:40] this and that so so we we Europeans
[29:42] often think ah they are not that many
[29:44] European bitcoiners but there are a lot
[29:46] we just don't understand them yeah and I
[29:48] think we we saw it in prag one and a
[29:50] half weeks ago as well so there was the
[29:53] the biggest European and the best
[29:55] European Bitcoin conference in Prague um
[29:58] a pretty good one I think it there were
[30:00] about 6,000 participants something like
[30:03] that and yeah 6,000 people that's quite
[30:05] a lot so all the Europeans come together
[30:07] and it's a yeah cool meeting point for
[30:10] All European countries so the Spanish
[30:12] guys the German guys the French guys and
[30:14] so on and yeah I think uh that's the
[30:17] proof that there is is quite a lot of
[30:20] quite a lot happening uh for Bitcoin in
[30:22] Europe as well and yes sure America is
[30:24] is a great country and America is doing
[30:26] a lot for Bitcoin the Americans I think
[30:29] are many many things are ahead than the
[30:32] Europeans but especially due to the
[30:34] regulations but the community is strong
[30:36] in in Europe and yeah I think that has a
[30:39] huge
[30:40] potential I was really Envy because like
[30:43] I was really deep in politics uh three
[30:46] years ago now I'm not at all uh but I
[30:49] was interested in the debates uh when in
[30:52] Austria in the European election and
[30:54] also in the American election was coming
[30:57] up not because of what they are saying
[31:00] but I was interested in what they're
[31:03] talking about like what topics are they
[31:05] bringing up in Austria with the EU
[31:07] election also on the EU level the uh the
[31:11] election debates uh I never heard
[31:13] anything about Bitcoin cryptos anything
[31:16] like that uh I think there's one guy who
[31:18] said like oh uh we we want hard we want
[31:21] hard currency again and they talked
[31:23] about Shilling like the Austrian
[31:26] currency before uh
[31:28] Euro and like yeah I don't know if if
[31:30] that's an advantage uh and in the
[31:33] American election uh Trump is talking
[31:36] about it he gets donations in Bitcoin he
[31:39] gets donations from bitcoiners even
[31:42] Biden had to talk about it a little bit
[31:44] uh and it's a topic uh it's at least
[31:46] they're talking about it at some extent
[31:49] it's not at a main topic of course but
[31:51] it's it's some topic and in the Europe
[31:53] European election like they don't even
[31:55] talk about it they they don't even
[31:56] discuss it we're like I see that
[31:58] Americans are a little bit more open a
[32:01] little bit more willing to to speak
[32:03] about that which I saw a little bit en
[32:06] in America election
[32:09] debates yeah H so definitely but but I
[32:12] think in in some years the the Europeans
[32:15] will need to follow the Americans when
[32:18] they see okay Bitcoin is not such a bad
[32:21] thing as we were thinking in the
[32:23] beginning and yeah so nowadays so
[32:26] Bitcoin in Europe is yeah not positive
[32:28] let's say it's not not too negative
[32:30] because the regulation okay it's okay
[32:33] you can use Bitcoin you can buy Bitcoin
[32:34] you can mine Bitcoin and things like
[32:36] that but it's not like that that the
[32:37] politicians are talking about Bitcoin
[32:39] and how great is Bitcoin and yeah in in
[32:41] America there is yeah happening quite a
[32:44] lot but that is the reason why we are
[32:46] working in in Europe in Austria and why
[32:48] we are yeah orange billing and yeah
[32:51] trying to educate the the Europeans and
[32:53] the European community and try to yeah
[32:56] onboard more people to bitco in Europe
[32:59] absolutely that's why I also try to give
[33:01] everyone in in Europe also a stage even
[33:03] though I see there are a lot of
[33:04] Americans on my
[33:06] podcast yeah so what is the what is the
[33:10] how many are Americans and how many
[33:11] Europeans do you have as guests in your
[33:13] podcast oh that would be interesting I I
[33:15] should uh make a statistic I only know
[33:17] about the audience I know about the
[33:20] audience there's like 50% Americans and
[33:22] 50% rest of the world uh there's United
[33:25] Kingdom in there also strong Canada is
[33:27] in there strong
[33:28] in Australia so like Germany for example
[33:31] only has like
[33:32] 4% um but I think I have already a lot
[33:37] of German atin guys El Salvador is very
[33:39] strong also in my
[33:42] guests they really want so I think in
[33:44] Germany there are a lot of big podcast
[33:47] and big YouTubers who just speak speak
[33:49] German and yeah I think most of the
[33:51] people just listen in the in the local
[33:53] language and yeah if there is a lot of
[33:56] Bitcoin content in the local language
[33:58] for especially in Germany yeah then the
[34:00] people just listen to the German podcast
[34:02] more and as we are speaking English yeah
[34:04] probably more the the US guys or the
[34:07] guys from the United Kingdom will listen
[34:08] to the podcast so yeah I totally
[34:10] understand it yeah and and that's that's
[34:13] one thing actually in there uh because
[34:15] when I started it I uh was thinking of
[34:18] like oh do I want to do it in English or
[34:20] German because like I have an English
[34:22] speaking uh girlfriend I have friends
[34:24] who speak English I I spoke the the work
[34:28] that I did even while starting the
[34:30] podcast I also spoke like 50% English
[34:32] there so English was never like a
[34:34] problem for me I like even before
[34:36] starting the podcast 80 70% of my life
[34:39] was already English uh so I kind of
[34:41] could took this decision uh like just
[34:45] like ah let's do this or that and then I
[34:47] looked at the German market and uh I was
[34:50] like ah interesting there is Nico doing
[34:52] a great podcast there are other at least
[34:55] five six podcasts there are little
[34:57] smaller but they're also doing a great
[34:59] job uh and then I look there other
[35:01] content creators there's Roman re here
[35:03] the block trainer uh there Sun degree
[35:05] they really a lot of great podcasters
[35:08] and content creators in the German
[35:09] Market where I was like I don't have to
[35:13] be another podcast I also don't have to
[35:15] be another podcast in English speaking
[35:17] in the Eng English speaking area I just
[35:20] can freely choose where I want to be
[35:23] because I don't have to fill any hole in
[35:25] any Market uh so I think this also
[35:27] speaks to the strength of the German
[35:30] speaking Market because if I would have
[35:33] seen like there's no great German
[35:35] speaking podcast of course I would have
[35:38] made one uh because it's also my native
[35:40] language and there's also like this one
[35:42] thing I I feel more comfortable in
[35:45] speaking English than the high standard
[35:47] of of
[35:48] German like because there's like a
[35:51] different Austrian German and and a
[35:53] German German I would say uh but yeah
[35:57] that's that's also one thing how was
[35:59] actually prag for you uh you you were
[36:01] there right yes prag was a great
[36:03] conference so I've been in prag for the
[36:06] second time last year as well for the
[36:08] BTC PR and yeah we had the booth there
[36:10] with 21 energy and had a lot of good
[36:13] connections good networking with other
[36:15] people a lot of interesting clients and
[36:17] yeah we also at a spinning wheel so all
[36:20] the people were spinning at our poof to
[36:22] win an out minor is nine and so it was
[36:25] kind a quite a good point to catch all
[36:27] the people
[36:28] no PR the conference was pretty good so
[36:29] the main stage was amazing even I did
[36:32] not saw one single talk at the main
[36:33] stage it was more at the poof and more
[36:36] networking but already watched some
[36:38] videos on YouTube and yeah the the
[36:40] people were great I also know the
[36:43] organizers a bit they making a good job
[36:45] and yeah trying to to bring on Bitcoin
[36:47] in Europe and yeah I think uh well done
[36:51] and see you next year in PR definitely I
[36:54] I'm so sorry that I missed you like I
[36:56] was I was
[36:58] only there I was three days there but I
[37:01] had five podcasts while I was there so I
[37:03] was not that much actually at the
[37:04] conference uh but I always try to to
[37:07] move around and and see everyone but
[37:10] there's so many people uh and uh
[37:15] unfortunately yeah no no you can't meet
[37:17] everyone so there will always be some
[37:18] people of the conference who think ah I
[37:20] should have met with him but that's okay
[37:22] so there are some other conferences as
[37:24] well and otherwise the there just the
[37:27] conference next year again and I think
[37:29] we will all meet at one point the
[37:31] conference and yeah I think it's also a
[37:33] proof that there quite a lot of
[37:36] conferences in Europe Bitcoin only
[37:37] conferences and great Bitcoin only
[37:40] conferences and yeah so the the
[37:43] Europeans are also making a good job in
[37:44] the conference scene absolutely uh you
[37:48] also organ uh organized uh with some
[37:52] others uh a Bitcoin conference I think
[37:54] it was the biggest one in in the German
[37:56] speaking area right
[37:58] yes exactly yeah that was the thing I so
[38:01] I I slightly told before uh I was
[38:04] crediting graduating from school uh four
[38:07] years ago so 2020 and then I had to do
[38:10] the Civil Service in Austria so in
[38:11] Austria you have to go either to the
[38:12] military or to the Civ civil service for
[38:14] one year and I was thinking a bit okay
[38:17] what what possibilities are there now
[38:19] what can I do now and I was thinking
[38:20] okay we go to university uh but then
[38:24] there yeah I heard by coincidence a bit
[38:26] that the best friend of my dad uh is
[38:28] plan planning a bit Bitcoin conference
[38:30] so even the big the biggest Bitcoin
[38:34] conference uh in the German speaking
[38:36] area and I I was just asking him okay
[38:39] Baby P can I help you a bit and in the
[38:42] beginning he was more like ah okay it's
[38:44] such a cool thing I want to do it on my
[38:46] own and but then he said okay yeah I can
[38:49] help him a bit and but then from time to
[38:51] time so he has another he has in his
[38:53] normal Fiat life he has a event Agency
[38:56] for bigger German companies and he had
[38:59] to do had a lot of work with the with
[39:01] the Fiat agency and yeah I became more
[39:04] or less the project manager of the of
[39:06] the conference and got to know many
[39:08] people and great networking contacts and
[39:11] it was yeah I think the best experience
[39:13] I could had I could have with I started
[39:16] with 20 years and when I when the
[39:18] conference was happening it was 21 years
[39:20] so yeah it was a pretty good year with
[39:23] 21 years organizing the the biggest
[39:25] German speaking conference and and yeah
[39:27] for my for me it was the the best
[39:29] experience to to connect with so many
[39:31] speakers and so many different people
[39:34] from different areas so some of them
[39:35] were like University professors other
[39:38] were big podcasters big YouTubers and it
[39:41] was pretty cool and so that's why you
[39:44] decided not to go to university and and
[39:46] and go directly in Bitcoin which is
[39:48] really cool that like kind Bitcoin saved
[39:50] you from
[39:51] University yeah yeah I would not save I
[39:54] would not say safe because yeah
[39:56] University isn't something bad H but
[39:59] yeah after the first year of the
[40:00] conference I was thinking okay um
[40:02] probably I can I I I should go to study
[40:06] at University now I was not I was not
[40:08] quite sure and yeah then I was even
[40:10] studying for three weeks at University
[40:13] um I did computer science uh but then at
[40:16] the same time I co-founded the company
[40:17] 21 energy we talked before and then we
[40:21] yeah there were the meetings at the same
[40:23] time so I had some uh some how to say
[40:26] some lectures at University uh where
[40:28] there was a I was obligated to to be to
[40:32] be there and at the same time we had
[40:34] yeah some meetings with the lawyer in
[40:36] Austria for the company and then I yeah
[40:38] needed to decide whether I want to to
[40:41] focus on bitcoin or on on the University
[40:43] and then it was clear for so it was an
[40:44] easy decision um yeah that I want to to
[40:49] focus myself on on bitcoin and on 21
[40:52] energy on the conference and and with uh
[40:54] 21 when you started working at the
[40:57] conference you already went were in
[41:00] Bitcoin uh how
[41:02] long yes uh so I was in Bitcoin for
[41:06] about one and a half years uh but not
[41:08] too deep into Bitcoin so I yeah I
[41:11] watched some videos and I uh yeah read
[41:15] some books and read some articles and
[41:17] things like that but it was not uh yeah
[41:19] that I was just thinking of Bitcoin
[41:21] every day and yeah so the conference and
[41:24] especially all the contacts I I get to
[41:26] know uh yeah help me help me a lot to
[41:29] understand more and more and also to be
[41:31] yeah just to say okay Bitcoin is the the
[41:34] cool thing and to get more and more
[41:35] motivation and because when you just
[41:37] work all day with bitcoiners uh yeah
[41:42] like can you cannot imagine that you are
[41:44] not becoming a bitcoiner yourself when
[41:47] you're organizing a conference so I was
[41:49] more a bitcoiner yes but I was not the
[41:52] the Bitcoin only Maxi exposure to a lot
[41:54] of bitcoiners definitely forms you uh
[41:58] it's like I have already like half a
[42:00] year now where I do everyday podcast
[42:03] with with bitcoiners and I'm since I
[42:06] don't know three years now around that
[42:08] time uh full in Bitcoin like all in like
[42:11] I sold all my stocks everything that I
[42:12] had before and I'm full in but still the
[42:16] exposure to all those great bitcoiners
[42:18] who do all those great things in Bitcoin
[42:20] that that forms you a lot so I can
[42:22] definitely understand that and before we
[42:25] come to the endro I have a question that
[42:27] is kind of like my my new endro tetin um
[42:30] what are you currently passionate about
[42:32] besides Bitcoin besides working in
[42:34] Bitcoin and learning about Bitcoin yes
[42:36] I'm quite passionate about sports and
[42:39] I'm also kind of a professional athlete
[42:41] and alpinist and yeah so before I
[42:44] started my Bitcoin career I was also
[42:46] already doing a lot of sport and yeah so
[42:50] uh most mainly Mountain Sports and
[42:52] alpinis yeah alistic stuff and yeah next
[42:54] week or this week in four days 3 days
[42:57] I'm going to Pakistan for an expedition
[42:59] on a 7,000 met Peak so this is my yeah
[43:03] second big Bion beside Bitcoin and when
[43:06] when I'm not working I'm mostly training
[43:08] at home and getting ready for bigger
[43:11] Mountain projects wait this is a like
[43:14] seven kilometers going up in the air or
[43:17] like is a hike or yes yes yes so the so
[43:21] the the Everest is
[43:23] 8,8 48 and we are trying a 7,000 met
[43:26] Peak and yeah amazing I love it is it
[43:31] like how long do you need up
[43:33] there um it pretty much depends on the
[43:36] mountain but we are planning to to go up
[43:38] three two or three days but it pretty
[43:40] much much depends on the mountain and on
[43:42] the difficulty of the the climbing rate
[43:44] so when it's quite easy so for example
[43:46] Everest it's not difficult to climb
[43:48] Everest for an alist uh Everest is
[43:51] regarding the the climbing difficulties
[43:53] they quite easy mountains it's only high
[43:55] but if you use the the Surplus oxygen uh
[43:58] yeah I would say a 50y old average man
[44:02] who trains for one or two years uh could
[44:05] normally go could normally do Everest as
[44:07] well and so but there are a lot of some
[44:10] smaller Peaks so there are lot of 7,000
[44:12] meter peaks in Pakistan and Nepal um
[44:15] which are unclimbed um still or which
[44:18] maybe have climbed one time 40 years ago
[44:20] and that's more the the motivation and
[44:23] the interesting Mountains for the
[44:24] alpinists and it also depends so if it's
[44:26] a pretty difficult Mountain it could
[44:28] take you four or five days as well to
[44:31] climb a th000 me phas and yeah what do
[44:35] you have to to take in account when you
[44:37] go up there with the air like you have
[44:39] to have some some air with you or like
[44:41] do you have to just go slower or like
[44:43] how does this work uh yeah no for the
[44:46] for so for for me um I'm more like or I
[44:50] have more like the opinion okay uh so
[44:52] using the the Surplus oxygen is like bit
[44:55] like cheating and and yeah so so I want
[44:59] use the Surplus oxygen and you just have
[45:01] to acclimatize enough and to spend a lot
[45:04] of time in the altitude before you go to
[45:05] the summit and yeah to have a good
[45:08] Fitness a lot of training in the the
[45:10] months and then the years before and
[45:12] yeah just slowly and but it also works
[45:17] with amazing love it perfect then uh
[45:20] that was a a great uh adventure and some
[45:24] other topics um before we come to the
[45:27] now we come to the end routine where the
