[00:00] because I think we will get to a Bitcoin
[00:01] standard. The question is just are we
[00:03] going gradually and very smoothly there
[00:07] or is there some revolution happening
[00:10] that might have some sort of war? The
[00:13] micro strategy story might actually
[00:16] steal fun and steal a lot of purchasing
[00:19] power away from the alcoins. That's
[00:21] probably the best thing anyone can do.
[00:24] Orange building their loved ones. If you
[00:26] know there's a flood coming, don't you
[00:28] want everyone to be on a boat? Even the
[00:30] last person that gets into the Bitcoin
[00:32] standard will benefit from Bitcoin
[00:35] massively because Bitcoin is
[00:37] transforming society. Even if you don't
[00:39] like Bitcoin, even if you hate Bitcoin,
[00:42] it will make your life better because we
[00:43] get better money. The big players are
[00:45] just testing the waters right now. And
[00:47] there's a lot of big
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] players. I got reinvited from Khif on
[00:55] the Real Hot Money Show. He got canned
[00:58] from YouTube and now starting all over
[01:00] again. It's really cool to see that he
[01:04] is extremely active and he's not giving
[01:07] up on his podcast. I love to see that as
[01:09] a podcast myself. And today's podcast is
[01:12] all about spending versus saving
[01:14] Bitcoin. We talked about the role of
[01:17] strategy B. So micro strategy previously
[01:19] and 21st capital in the whole market and
[01:22] what institutional money and
[01:24] institutional uh buying behavior is
[01:27] changing for Bitcoin and also how
[01:29] Bitcoin is kind of a social and even a
[01:31] spiritual revolution. I went through my
[01:33] own journey also here. So it's an honor,
[01:36] it's a pleasure to be on this podcast.
[01:38] So I wanted to share it also with you
[01:40] guys. Uh enjoy. Today we have a special
[01:44] guest I'd like to call a Bitcoiner
[01:46] friend of mine, Robin Ser of the Robin
[01:49] Ser podcast. Uh I this guy I admire him
[01:53] so much because he's a dedicated a
[01:55] dedicated Bitcoiner bringing the stories
[01:58] of other Bitcoiners from around the
[02:01] world to light no matter who they are
[02:04] whether it's a guy like me simply
[02:06] talking about Bitcoin or just a holder
[02:08] or even the main man himself Michael
[02:11] Sailor of Micro Strategy Now strategy
[02:13] without further ado ladies and gentlemen
[02:16] Robin Ser how are you sir thank you so
[02:18] much that was a very kind introduction
[02:20] yeah like uh almost 500 guests I'm I'm
[02:22] approaching now. 500 500 different
[02:25] guests on the podcast. Wow, that's
[02:27] incredible. You know, you actually
[02:29] inspired me to to actually start this
[02:32] podcast again and basically follow your
[02:35] group blueprint because you know you
[02:37] know the YouTube grind. You can just
[02:39] keep going and going and if it's not a
[02:41] purpose or something that you feel
[02:43] deeply about, it could be a drag, right?
[02:46] So I I think like talking to people like
[02:48] you, yourself, and others with like
[02:51] minds, I think it's really good. It keep
[02:53] it keeps you going because it's
[02:54] Bitcoin's ever interesting, right? We
[02:57] can talk about Bitcoin for hours and
[02:59] hours. It's something like if you really
[03:02] like doing it, even if you don't get any
[03:04] any money from that, you just keep keep
[03:07] going. I'm I'm in like a situation where
[03:09] I actually can can call talking with
[03:11] with Bitcoin as my my full-time job.
[03:14] Even without money, I would still do it
[03:16] like maybe once a week. I wouldn't have
[03:18] the time to do it every day because it's
[03:20] a lot of work if if it's not paying. But
[03:23] it's such a passion of mine finding out
[03:25] the orange printing journeys, finding
[03:28] out the why Bitcoin matters, how Bitcoin
[03:30] is best built and and where are we going
[03:33] in in this Bitcoin world, where are we
[03:34] in this Bitcoin cycles. So, it's it's
[03:37] something that I'm truly passionate
[03:38] about. And that's how I kind of grew out
[03:40] the the podcast because I first started
[03:43] as like, oh, I don't have anyone to talk
[03:45] to about Bitcoin in my real life. I
[03:48] orange built them, but they're not that
[03:50] down the road that as I am. So, I needed
[03:53] to find on Twitter and YouTube and all
[03:55] the online platforms some some Bitcoin
[03:58] of friends as you call them to talk
[04:00] about with them about Bitcoin. And
[04:02] that's kind of how the podcast started.
[04:04] And yeah, if if if YouTube goes ahead
[04:05] and and and says like goodbye to me, I I
[04:08] would just keep going on the other
[04:09] platforms even even if if the pace is is
[04:12] smaller or like decreasing or completely
[04:14] falling away. Maybe not in the same
[04:16] frequency, but I I just keep keep going
[04:18] what I'm doing. I love it. I love it.
[04:20] So, if you guys aren't following him
[04:22] already, check him out on X formerly
[04:24] Twitter at Robin Sire podcast or what is
[04:27] it? It's always Robin Sire my my name
[04:30] together.
[04:31] No, nothing else. I I reserved all the
[04:35] handles on all my all the platforms with
[04:38] my first name and last name with nothing
[04:40] in between. In that way, it's easier to
[04:43] to verify if it's actually me because
[04:45] they're like Robin Sire podcast with
[04:46] like things and they're usually scams
[04:48] and they're always scams. Only one
[04:50] profile on each platform. Yeah. Okay.
[04:53] So, you guys check him out right there.
[04:55] His channel's growing incredibly.
[04:57] Congratulations on that. Last time I
[04:59] checked checked in with you, you had
[05:01] just interviewed Michael Sailor and you
[05:03] were about to interview Max Kaiser, you
[05:06] know, tell tell us about that
[05:07] experience. Can you talk about like what
[05:09] what it's like to talk talk to so many
[05:11] different Bitcoiners as a podcaster? I
[05:14] call you the Larry King of Bitcoin
[05:16] because you speak to interview so many,
[05:18] but not just the common Bitcoiner, but
[05:20] you know, these high-profile Bitcoiners
[05:22] as well. How how do you find that
[05:24] experience? You get a really good
[05:26] feeling for where we are currently. You
[05:28] get a feeling for how freaking early we
[05:33] are in this Bitcoin revolution in the
[05:35] sound money revolution. Because there's
[05:38] two things. The first thing that you
[05:40] really get from all those conversations
[05:42] is the sense of what Bitcoin actually is
[05:45] where we are in the journey and this and
[05:48] the fir all the things that Bitcoin
[05:50] touches. When we talk about uh
[05:53] traditional values, running a family,
[05:55] being a good diet, doing sports, doing
[05:58] your proof of work, those things kind of
[06:00] are a chasen to Bitcoin, but not
[06:03] directly correlated to Bitcoin. It's
[06:05] just comes when you go down the rabbit
[06:07] hole. All of the sudden you're like,
[06:08] "Okay, I should work out. I do should
[06:10] proof of work. I should take
[06:12] responsibility. I do should self custody
[06:15] um of of everything. I question things
[06:17] that otherwise probably wouldn't have
[06:19] questioned." So, Bitcoin takes it down
[06:22] those two journeys. I feel like the
[06:24] first one is just directly about
[06:26] Bitcoin, what it is, where we are, and
[06:29] and where are we going? We can go down
[06:31] that lane and and it's it's really fun
[06:33] to talk about that. And the second one
[06:35] is, as I said, all the adjacent topics
[06:38] of Bitcoin, even politics to a certain
[06:40] degree, and how governments will evolve
[06:42] with with Bitcoin. This is is really
[06:44] fun. And I name my podcast very
[06:47] intentionally just the Robin Sire
[06:49] podcast because I want to keep doing
[06:51] that all my life. And maybe in 10 20
[06:54] years Bitcoin is kind of boring because
[06:56] everyone is using it and Bitcoin is just
[06:57] a medium exchange. Nobody nobody has a a
[07:01] fiat currency podcast right now because
[07:05] that would be something very boring to
[07:06] have, right? And nobody has a TCPIP
[07:11] protocol podcast right now, right? they
[07:14] might have a podcast about a technology
[07:16] that is built on top of TCPIP but not
[07:19] about the base layer and Bitcoin is that
[07:21] base layer. So maybe there are things
[07:23] that are I'm going to build build on top
[07:25] of Bitcoin like the payment layer and
[07:28] this might be an interesting discussion
[07:29] also down the road. But right now, I'm
[07:32] just really really focused on what is
[07:34] Bitcoin, where are we going, why it's
[07:36] important, and how can we get as smooth
[07:40] as possible to a Bitcoin standard?
[07:42] Because I think we will get to a Bitcoin
[07:43] standard. The question is just are we
[07:46] going gradually and very smoothly there?
[07:49] Or is there some revolution happening
[07:52] that might have some sort of war?
[07:55] doesn't have to be a physical war, but
[07:57] some sort of the incumbent system tries
[08:00] to fight back harder. Right now, we
[08:02] don't see the incumbent system really
[08:04] fighting hard. We see America embracing
[08:07] it. We see big institutions like the
[08:09] Black Rockck embracing it. Even China
[08:12] gets silent now on on on the Bitcoin
[08:14] topic. Maybe they even buy it in in in
[08:17] the behind the scenes. So, right now
[08:19] there's not a lot of fighting going on
[08:21] against Bitcoin here and there. Yes,
[08:23] banks bam people when there's like
[08:25] bitcoin transactions like there's small
[08:27] things happening. It's the fight is not
[08:29] over. If that continues, it will be very
[08:31] smooth transition. And if we are
[08:33] successful in orange billing as many
[08:35] people as possible, that transition will
[08:37] continue to be smooth. But if you're not
[08:39] successful in orange billing as many
[08:42] people as possible, uh we will still get
[08:44] to a Bitcoin standard. I think that's
[08:46] inevitable right now. But the way to a
[08:49] Bitcoin standard might be a little bit
[08:52] more rocky than it is uh than it's used
[08:56] to be than it has to be. Yeah, I can see
[08:59] that. I can see that. Um it it's
[09:02] definitely going to be some kind of war,
[09:04] like you said, some kind of a currency
[09:06] war, a soft war. It's hard for power to
[09:09] let power go, right? But I I feel like
[09:12] their their financial system is kind of
[09:15] a Trojan horse in itself because greed
[09:18] because of greed. Everybody wants to act
[09:21] in their self-interest and you should
[09:23] but I think people will come for the
[09:25] greed and that they'll stay for the
[09:26] revolution in my opinion. Yeah. So
[09:29] speaking of which today's a great
[09:31] interesting day because it's the first
[09:33] day of strategy the convention for micro
[09:36] strategy and strategy world I believe
[09:39] it's called. And uh me myself, I think I
[09:43] stand a little opposite of some of my
[09:45] Bitcoin maxi friends. And seeing that
[09:48] what uh Michael Sailor is doing, him and
[09:50] his team and the financialization of
[09:53] Bitcoin, the the wizardry, financial
[09:56] engineering is masterful. I think um if
[10:00] it was going to be someone to do this,
[10:04] you know, from the evil corp world of
[10:06] fiat, I think we couldn't have a better
[10:09] uh representative. Honestly, I think uh
[10:11] Michael Seller understands Bitcoin. I
[10:13] think he he's totally bought in. I think
[10:16] he's a true Bitcoiner at heart. He sees
[10:18] what it is. He sees it as a tool for
[10:21] good. It's a thing for good. people of
[10:23] you know when he he does these million
[10:25] interviews right and uh they ask him the
[10:27] same question and he just takes a deep
[10:29] breath and and then you know lets off
[10:31] another beautiful monologue like he does
[10:34] he speaks incredibly about it what I
[10:36] think is like he said at the end of one
[10:38] of his interviews no one asks me if I
[10:40] think it's
[10:42] good you know and I think and he says I
[10:45] think it's a good thing for the world
[10:47] and that is the thing that I think you
[10:49] alluded to when you said you know the
[10:51] overlap of Bitcoin pointers where you
[10:53] know maybe I should eat better maybe I
[10:56] should you know take care of myself you
[10:58] start thinking about a longer time
[10:59] preference and not just greed what can I
[11:02] get now what can I take from the next
[11:03] man because the debt system that we have
[11:05] is based on debt right but what do you
[11:08] think what are your thoughts about MSTR
[11:10] Micro Strategy and uh Michael Seller
[11:13] himself and what they're doing is it a
[11:15] good thing is it a bad thing some
[11:17] Bitcoiners are split on it because
[11:20] they're consolidating they have 500,000
[11:22] in Bitcoin now, right? So, what do you
[11:25] think? Is that a good thing to
[11:26] consolidate in one place like that?
[11:29] There are so the first thing you you
[11:32] kind of brought up is is a strategy and
[11:34] this is such an amazing topic and I want
[11:36] to get to that. There's another thing
[11:38] that you kind of brought up there, the
[11:40] impact of Bitcoin. And I also want to
[11:42] touch on on that a little bit later. So,
[11:44] let's let's stick with the first one
[11:45] with strategy. I think Michael Sailor
[11:49] with Micro Strategy in 2020 and now
[11:53] strategy B opened a black hole for the
[11:58] fiat world to get transferred faster and
[12:04] quicker and in a accelerated way
[12:09] directly to Bitcoin. This is a spec spec
[12:14] um hard to tell you. This is an Yeah,
[12:17] it's a spectacular and it's an extreme
[12:20] attack on on on the feared world.
[12:22] Speculative. Yeah, speculative attack
[12:25] that that's my non English speaking
[12:29] non words. Yeah, always says that.
[12:32] That's an extreme attack on on the fiat
[12:35] network. And yeah, of course, we want to
[12:38] have want to have as many bitcoins on
[12:41] the PL level as possible is not a
[12:43] concern for Bitcoin to have some
[12:46] concentration at at some points with
[12:48] micro strategy or with other things
[12:51] because it's a proofof work system, not
[12:53] a proof ofstake system. With proof
[12:54] ofstake systems, you automatically have
[12:57] a power with a stake. So if Micro
[13:00] Strategy would have let's say 10 20 30%
[13:04] stake of Ethereum they wouldn't have a
[13:07] huge impact on the network itself and
[13:10] Michael Sailor can have as many Bitcoin
[13:12] as he wants even to an extreme if he
[13:15] says let's have say he only owns 5
[13:19] million Bitcoin. He doesn't really have
[13:22] an impact on the network. Yes, he can
[13:24] pay people with a lot of money to say
[13:27] tell stories and to shift the narrative.
[13:30] But when you just look at the stake that
[13:32] he has, this does not give him any
[13:35] influence over the network. He might
[13:37] have an influence over the network
[13:39] because he is a public speaker in
[13:41] Bitcoin. He might have an influence on
[13:44] Bitcoin because he could, he doesn't,
[13:46] but he could go ahead and pay people to
[13:49] put the narrative in a certain way. But
[13:51] he can also do that without Bitcoin.
[13:53] Black coin can also do that. China can
[13:55] do that. A big player without any
[13:57] Bitcoin can also do that. So just the
[13:59] thing that he has a lot of Bitcoin
[14:01] doesn't give him any power over Bitcoin.
[14:04] That's the beauty of it. And because we
[14:06] have a proof of work system, those
[14:08] Bitcoin will over time be distributed.
[14:11] Maybe not the next 5 to 10 years. In the
[14:13] next 5 to 10 years, maybe he gets more
[14:15] and more like maybe he grows to like
[14:18] 800,000 a million Bitcoin. who knows how
[14:20] many he can accumulate but he gets now
[14:23] um competitions with 21 capital he gets
[14:26] competitions from other publicly traded
[14:27] companies and the more they do it the
[14:30] more they acquired the less he will be
[14:32] able to actually stack because the price
[14:35] will just run up and at some point those
[14:37] fiat engineering games might not work
[14:40] because fiat is no longer there and then
[14:42] you will actually have to work for every
[14:44] bitcoin I already have most of my income
[14:46] in bitcoin and some of my expenses even
[14:48] in bitco coin. There's a a capital flow
[14:50] from Bitcoin directly to Bitcoin. So, I
[14:53] no longer buy Bitcoin because most of my
[14:56] income is in Bitcoin. So, I earn Bitcoin
[14:59] every month. I haven't touched a Bitcoin
[15:01] exchange to buy Bitcoin for like 5
[15:03] months now. I sometimes have to sell
[15:05] Bitcoin to cover fiat bills. And the
[15:08] important thing for me is just if I go
[15:11] in the first month, let's say in
[15:13] February, I go in with a certain amount
[15:15] of Satoshi's. I want to have a little
[15:17] bit more satoshias in the end of the
[15:19] month. That's all I'm trying to do to
[15:22] stack some satoshi. I'm 100% on Bitcoin.
[15:25] I only have a bank account to transfer
[15:27] some Bitcoin on there and pay some fiat
[15:29] bits, but there's like nothing on that
[15:31] bank account. It's just a medium of
[15:33] exchange side of things. So, I'm already
[15:35] on that 100% Bitcoin standard where I
[15:37] have to earn Bitcoin. And coming back to
[15:39] micro strategy, they also have to
[15:41] actually work and they are doing actual
[15:43] work also outside of just acquiring
[15:45] Bitcoin of course, but at some point
[15:47] they can only do actual proof of work to
[15:50] buy to earn Bitcoin because buying
[15:52] Bitcoin and I was actually yesterday
[15:54] also on a podcast and he he asked me or
[15:57] when do we know when are we too late to
[15:59] Bitcoin? Because everyone thinks he's
[16:00] too late to Bitcoin. The moment you're
[16:03] no longer able to buy Bitcoin with fiat
[16:05] currencies is the moment you know you're
[16:08] too late. If you if you have to work to
[16:11] get Bitcoin, it might be you might miss
[16:14] the train a little bit on that Bitcoin
[16:16] bandwagon. So right now we are super
[16:19] duper early. Everything under a million
[16:21] is so cheap. I cannot even explain how
[16:23] cheap it is. And that we are not only
[16:25] under a million dollars per coin, we are
[16:27] actually under 100k still is is
[16:30] fascinating. I mean, I don't know if
[16:32] when this will air, but maybe the market
[16:34] moves fast and we already over 100k now
[16:36] when when when this happens. So this is
[16:39] one side micro strategy now strategy B
[16:42] opened a portal uh a black hole for the
[16:45] fiat market to come in here and all of
[16:48] the fiat people really like to engage
[16:51] with micro strategy and they will engage
[16:53] more and more with it. It's the best
[16:55] performing asset. It's better performing
[16:57] than Nvidia. It's it's such a nobrainer
[17:00] for me that
[17:03] common investors outside of Bitcoin look
[17:05] at Micro Strategy and like hey maybe
[17:07] maybe I put a little bit I don't like
[17:09] that Bitcoin thing but I like what what
[17:12] what Micro Strategy is doing because
[17:15] they seem to have an extreme
[17:17] performance. So and I also see we had in
[17:20] past cycles this altcoin season where
[17:22] people are like hey I want to have some
[17:24] altcoins to outperform Bitcoin. I see
[17:27] the same people now doing it with Micro
[17:29] Strategy, right? Micro strategy. And
[17:31] it's a better altcoin, right?
[17:34] Because it's based on Bitcoin. It's
[17:35] based on Bitcoin and there's actually
[17:37] work happening and and actually for for
[17:39] me something very useful. So the micro
[17:42] strategy story might actually steal fun
[17:46] and steal a lot of purchasing power away
[17:49] from the altcoins because everything is
[17:51] now on Bitcoin. And if you want to have
[17:52] a faster Bitcoin performance and Bitcoin
[17:55] is already crazy fast, you can just go
[17:57] ahead and have some strategy, you can
[18:00] even have a leverage on micro strategy,
[18:04] which is already a leverage on Bitcoin.
[18:05] So you have a leverage on a leverage if
[18:07] you really want to go fast. It's I don't
[18:09] recommend that. I don't do that. But if
[18:11] you want to do that, go ahead and do it.
[18:13] You you do have the possibility now. So
[18:15] with all that being said, I think
[18:17] strategy is a net positive for Bitcoin.
[18:20] There are negatives, there are positive
[18:22] to it, but everything taken in
[18:24] consideration, it's something very
[18:25] positive for Bitcoin. It's very clever
[18:28] what he's doing and the way he's doing
[18:31] is so smart and so disciplined. This guy
[18:34] is disciplined. I I don't know if I told
[18:37] you, but I was at the 100K party for
[18:40] Michael Sailor. Oh, I didn't know you
[18:41] went. Yeah, it was a it was a crazy
[18:44] crazy. Talk about that. Yeah, talk about
[18:47] Yeah, I I just wanted to talk about that
[18:49] one aspect, but I can talk about it
[18:50] later a little bit more. Okay,
[18:53] you have to imagine this is a
[18:55] multi-billionaire who is really rich,
[18:57] has like yachts, has everything you can
[19:00] dream of. I never saw him with even one
[19:03] drink the whole evening. I I never saw
[19:05] him doing anything
[19:08] um uh anything is like because I thought
[19:12] like, okay, it's like a party, he can
[19:14] let go a little bit. No, he's super
[19:16] disciplined. This man is super
[19:19] disciplined and super focused on the
[19:21] mission of
[19:23] Bitcoin. And I asked him this on my
[19:25] podcast and asked him the question of
[19:28] what is the most valuable thing you have
[19:30] that you cannot buy with money? And he
[19:32] told me Bitcoin, the mission of Bitcoin
[19:35] because before he discovered Bitcoin, he
[19:38] already went ahead and was planning to
[19:40] retire. He stepped away from being the
[19:42] CEO of Strategy. that was planned before
[19:45] he even discovered Bitcoin. That was a
[19:47] five-year plan that he he already did
[19:49] before he discovered Bitcoin. So, this
[19:52] was something very interesting for me
[19:54] where Bitcoin gave him a second life. He
[19:57] gave him another mission in his life to
[20:00] pursue and now he's driven, now he's
[20:03] motivated. And I see that a lot with
[20:04] with Bitcoiners that um maybe were like,
[20:07] "Okay, maybe 50, 55, going to the 60s, I
[20:11] want to retire now." No, like Bitcoin
[20:12] gives them a second life, a mission,
[20:14] something to pursue. And I got a little
[20:17] bit sidetracked, but that but you don't
[20:19] see you don't see people like, oh, I
[20:22] want to uh talk about fiat for the rest
[20:24] of my life or I want to talk about SMTP
[20:26] for the rest of my life. No, there's
[20:29] something there that people need to
[20:30] understand. And to touch on what you're
[20:32] saying, to kind of double click on what
[20:34] you just said, it's a spiritual thing.
[20:37] People don't get it. When you really get
[20:39] Bitcoin, it takes you to a spiritual
[20:41] place. That's why M Max Kaiser is going
[20:43] with the High Priestess and Bitcoin is
[20:45] Jesus and Bitcoin is God. He's being
[20:48] Max, right? He's being hyperbolic,
[20:50] right? But there's something to that
[20:52] because just like you said, it makes you
[20:53] reflect and you want to be better. You
[20:55] want to do better. You can see how it's
[20:57] for all of humanity. It's it's equality.
[21:00] You know, it it's for everyone. So, it's
[21:03] not only people would say, "Yeah, I get
[21:04] Bitcoin. I understand it. I think it
[21:06] it'll do well. First of all, if you
[21:09] don't own it, you don't get it. Right?
[21:11] If you get it, first thing you do is I
[21:13] got to get more of it because I don't
[21:14] have enough Bitcoin. Right? That's what
[21:16] Michael Zeller did before he did
[21:18] anything with uh Micro Strategy. He got
[21:21] some for himself. And it makes you study
[21:23] it more. It makes you learn more about
[21:24] it. And the next thing is it takes you
[21:27] to when you really truly understand it.
[21:29] I do think there is a spiritual
[21:32] component to it. Not to say that it's
[21:33] Jesus or God or religion, but I think it
[21:36] makes you look internally in yourself
[21:39] and you start to question things that
[21:41] were told to you by the system or like
[21:44] powers that be or even your parents, you
[21:46] know, school, you know, whatever. They
[21:48] didn't know any better because they grew
[21:49] up in a fiat world and we grew we we now
[21:52] have Bitcoin. And I kind of I kind of I
[21:54] shudder to think what if we didn't have
[21:56] Bitcoin now. It's a very dystopian
[21:59] outlook, you know, but I didn't mean to
[22:02] cut you off. Go ahead. It's actually
[22:04] perfect transition to the second point
[22:06] that I was saying before I wanted to do
[22:08] the first one strategy second point
[22:10] because I think and this is something
[22:12] completely underrated even the last
[22:14] person that gets into the Bitcoin
[22:17] standard will benefit from Bitcoin
[22:19] massively because Bitcoin is
[22:21] transforming society. So when we look at
[22:24] past inventions, we can start with the
[22:27] printing press and going up to the
[22:28] electricity and up to uh uh the internet
[22:32] even going down like that. There's so
[22:34] many inventions down the road of history
[22:37] where we can always see something
[22:40] happen. So the first thing that happens
[22:42] is the people that embrace it the first
[22:44] and build businesses around the
[22:46] invention or buy stakes in that thing.
[22:49] Whatever it is, it's different depending
[22:51] like you cannot buy stocks of the
[22:53] printing press per se. In Bitcoin, you
[22:55] can actually buy the underlying asset,
[22:57] the underlying invention. So you have to
[22:59] buy build business around that and those
[23:01] inventions bring level up humanity. So
[23:05] even the last person to ever read a
[23:07] book, the last person to like adopt the
[23:10] book as a media exchange after the
[23:12] printing press, this is this is already
[23:16] getting this makes a person already
[23:18] better. This makes humanity better. Even
[23:21] if you're not the first one like
[23:22] Johannes Gutenberg to print the books in
[23:25] a more effective way. And and before the
[23:27] printing press was invented, a book took
[23:29] like months, sometimes even over a year
[23:31] to print because someone had to write it
[23:34] actually down. And it was only through
[23:36] Johannes Gutenberg where he made it
[23:39] possible. I think the first 5 years he
[23:41] printed 180 copies of of the the
[23:44] Gutenberg Bible. Uh I mean there's
[23:46] another aspect. Most of the first uh
[23:49] books were very religious books. I think
[23:51] the first like 5 million or 10 million
[23:53] books were like very religious books in
[23:55] in the majority of it. Another
[23:57] interesting aspect as as Bitcoin gets
[24:00] sometimes really connected with
[24:02] spirituality with religion and all all
[24:04] those things. But the point I was trying
[24:06] to make is Bitcoin will transform
[24:09] humanity on a very deep level and uplift
[24:13] humanity for everyone. Even if you don't
[24:16] like Bitcoin, even if you hate Bitcoin,
[24:18] it will make your life better because we
[24:20] get better money. In the same way as
[24:22] it's good that everyone can read and
[24:25] write books and and consume information
[24:27] and information is free available with
[24:30] books and then with the internet and
[24:32] electricity and with the phone and the
[24:34] telegraph and everything like that. All
[24:36] our innovations that made everything
[24:39] better. Yes, there are people that lose
[24:42] out on things like there is some guy uh
[24:46] that bought like I don't know 10,000
[24:49] horses and Henry Ford came along and had
[24:51] an idea. He he lost something because he
[24:54] he didn't see it coming there. He he
[24:57] he's he's he there there's some there
[25:00] there's always losers and winners in
[25:02] massive transitions of that and the
[25:05] winners are those who embrace the new
[25:06] technology and having informed opinions
[25:09] and really diving deep on those and the
[25:11] losers are those who are ignorant and
[25:14] arrogant against or maybe even lazy
[25:16] against new innovations. It's also
[25:19] something that I discovered people that
[25:21] don't get Bitcoin have one out of three
[25:24] things. they either are ignorant, lazy
[25:27] or arrogant. And most people because I
[25:30] don't think that anyone is too dumb to
[25:32] understand Bitcoin. Everyone who can
[25:34] read and write and and have like some
[25:37] basic knowledge skills and some basic
[25:40] math skills like most people especially
[25:43] in the developed world can can
[25:45] understand Bitcoin. Yes, there there
[25:47] might be uh like a small portion that
[25:50] might actually not like they have some
[25:51] brain disease like obviously I'm not
[25:53] talking about those but most people are
[25:56] clever enough to figure out Bitcoin why
[25:59] they're not doing it. They either
[26:00] ignorant against Bitcoin because I don't
[26:03] I don't want to deal with that. I'm just
[26:05] pushing it away. They're arrogant saying
[26:07] no no I know a better Bitcoin. I know I
[26:10] I I think gold is is better. I I store
[26:13] my money in real estate. It's a better
[26:15] store of value. No, like look at the
[26:16] facts. The last 10 years, the last 5
[26:18] years, pick any time frame you want.
[26:21] Real estate is crashing against Bitcoin.
[26:24] Everything is crashing against Bitcoin.
[26:26] Unfortunately, there's a site called
[26:28] priced in Bitcoin and it's currently
[26:30] down. I love the side. If it it's down
[26:33] for too long, I have I have to build it
[26:35] myself. It even crashed against Bitcoin,
[26:38] huh? Bitcoin took it down. Absolutely.
[26:41] Yeah. So, yeah, that's all I feel like
[26:43] we're like preaching to the choir. We're
[26:45] like, "Yeah, Bitcoin, I love it." Yeah,
[26:47] I love it, too. Um, you know, tell me,
[26:50] let's get into some hot takes. Give me
[26:52] your hottest take, Robin. Your hottest
[26:54] take that, you know, sometimes you might
[26:56] be hesitant to even say out loud on the
[26:59] air, you know? Give me something
[27:01] something raw and hot. I don't know how
[27:03] raw and hot it is, but people seem to
[27:06] disagree with that. I spend my Bitcoin.
[27:08] I I use Bitcoin as money. I I don't
[27:10] think it's something that should be
[27:12] controversial, but every time I say it
[27:14] like how how can you spend Bitcoin? You
[27:16] understand it? Like you you will sell it
[27:18] now and like you you will be like the
[27:20] pizza guy. And I'm like yeah, I get it,
[27:22] but I earn in Bitcoin so I have to spend
[27:24] in Bitcoin, right? Like what else should
[27:26] I do? Should I take out credit? Yeah, I
[27:28] might be a good idea, but I don't want
[27:29] to deal with credit. I'm not a Michael
[27:31] Sailor. I let Michael Zaylor do the
[27:33] speculative attack and do the fiat
[27:36] engineering, the fiat money engineering.
[27:38] I myself I like spending my bitcoin. I I
[27:41] spend bitcoin every month. I pay a
[27:43] freelancer in bitcoin. I convert bitcoin
[27:46] on my balance sheet do uh fiat to pay
[27:50] fiat bills with it. I sell bitcoin all
[27:52] the time and I earn bitcoin all the
[27:54] time. The important thing is that you
[27:56] have a little bit more satoshi at the
[27:58] end of the day. So like every month you
[28:00] get a little bit more. I don't know how
[28:02] hot this take is. I think it's pretty
[28:04] uncontroversial, but I always get like
[28:06] backlash of that like, oh yeah, never
[28:08] sell your Bitcoin, right? Exactly. But
[28:11] may maybe you should spend it. Maybe you
[28:13] should just use money as money. Like
[28:15] Bitcoin is money, so why not use it as
[28:17] as as money? It's not only a store of
[28:19] value. It's also a medium of exchange
[28:21] and unit of account. And it's really
[28:22] powerful once you switch to a unit of
[28:25] account of Bitcoin. You price everything
[28:27] in Bitcoin. You're like, do I really
[28:29] need that And yeah, that's it. It
[28:31] it makes a it makes a difference and
[28:33] also using it as money is something very
[28:36] very and that might be very
[28:38] controversial and Jeff Bof said it also
[28:40] and even Jeff gets a lot of backlash for
[28:44] that. If if Bitcoin isn't successful as
[28:47] a medium of exchange it might also fail
[28:51] as a store of value. There is there's a
[28:53] lot of good arguments against that.
[28:54] There's a lot of good arguments for
[28:56] that. I'm not 100% sure on that because
[28:59] neither am I. Bitcoin, Bitcoin is super
[29:02] important as a medium of exchange and it
[29:04] already is a medium of exchange for me
[29:06] personally. But if it completely fails
[29:08] as a medium of exchange, it definitely
[29:10] doesn't have the full potential that it
[29:12] could have because gold now is a big
[29:15] asset, big store of value and also is
[29:17] not a medium of exchange at all. Like
[29:20] Bitcoin is more used as a medium
[29:21] exchange than gold. Yeah. But it's still
[29:24] a big asset. But how big would it be if
[29:26] it would also be the major a med of
[29:29] exchange and then store of value? If
[29:31] Bitcoin fails as a as a medium of
[29:33] exchange, it will not also fail
[29:35] completely as a store of value, but it
[29:37] will miss out on a massive amount being
[29:41] bigger as a store of value because then
[29:43] all of the sudden if you can exchange it
[29:45] as a media exchange and also then later
[29:47] as a unit of account, a lot of people
[29:49] will just opt in a Bitcoin standard and
[29:52] have
[29:52] Bitcoin 100% 80% 90% 70% on their
[29:58] personal balance sheet. Let's take a
[30:00] break for a moment and appreciate the
[30:02] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[30:05] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[30:08] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[30:11] of showing that you are a true
[30:14] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[30:16] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:19] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:21] collections. You have the date of the
[30:24] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[30:27] and of course also the block height and
[30:30] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[30:33] the level of detail they put in in this
[30:36] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[30:38] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:41] down in the descriptions. I love those
[30:43] watches so so much. And now if you have
[30:47] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[30:49] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[30:51] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[30:53] to deal with that. The first way is you
[30:56] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[30:58] entry for you to get into the
[31:00] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[31:04] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:06] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:09] check out the link in the description,
[31:11] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:14] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:17] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:20] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:23] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:26] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:29] that is perfect for your individual
[31:32] situation. They will show you how you
[31:34] can secure your own devices. Securing
[31:37] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[31:39] have to keep all your devices secure.
[31:41] One topic that is overlooked often is
[31:44] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[31:46] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[31:49] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[31:52] place already? And last but not least,
[31:54] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[31:56] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[31:58] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[32:03] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:06] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:09] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:11] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:14] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:17] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:19] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:21] the link down in the description of
[32:24] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[32:26] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:30] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:31] there. I think that is the other way
[32:33] around. I think that if it does not
[32:35] succeed as a store of value, it will
[32:38] fail as a medium of exchange because
[32:41] people won't want to trust it and put
[32:43] their money into it. Kind of like Sailor
[32:45] says, it's digital capital. It's digital
[32:47] property, right? This is the market that
[32:49] the people that buy houses, real estate
[32:52] just for land banking, just for
[32:54] investment. They're turning their houses
[32:55] into a financial product, which it
[32:57] shouldn't be. They use this for a
[32:59] utility. people who buy art, people who
[33:01] uh invest in all of these other things
[33:03] so that the store they store their
[33:06] wealth throughout time. Uh this is the
[33:09] market that I think uh Bitcoin will
[33:12] gobble up and become a black hole and
[33:14] swallow up, right? But if it does not do
[33:17] that, I don't think people would even be
[33:19] interested in Bitcoin as a medium
[33:22] exchange. Maybe perhaps because it's
[33:26] insensorable, right? It's um well,
[33:29] censorship resistance and no one can
[33:31] stop it. So there there's that it's
[33:34] these it's the combination it's the
[33:36] beautiful combination amalgamation of
[33:38] all of these tenants and principles that
[33:41] Bitcoin has. It's just comes together
[33:43] that makes it unlike anything else that
[33:46] we've ever seen that it's truly
[33:49] unconfiscable. It's truly decentralized.
[33:51] It's truly unstoppable. It's censorship
[33:53] resistant. it all these things together.
[33:56] I I mean it's hard for me to like
[33:59] speaking with people like you, we get
[34:01] it. We understand it. We're kind of in
[34:02] our bubble and uh we kind of wonder like
[34:05] you know why don't you know the regular
[34:07] person normies get it you know why don't
[34:10] they get it what do you think why why
[34:12] don't they get it like you said fearful
[34:14] you said uh ignorant arrogant or lazy I
[34:17] think it's a lot of fear in that because
[34:19] a lot of people are just sheeple right
[34:21] they need to be told they need to be you
[34:23] know told it's okay to invest in this
[34:26] thing but I think the fear is is really
[34:28] what holds people back from this new I
[34:31] think it's so new. I I want to touch
[34:33] before uh a little bit on on what you
[34:35] said with store of value because it's
[34:37] super interesting and and and this is
[34:39] exactly how I also think about uh if med
[34:42] of exchange fails, store of value will
[34:45] not be at full capacity. The same way
[34:47] the other way around if store of value
[34:48] fails, med of exchange will also not be
[34:50] at full capacity. I think it holds more
[34:52] weight for store of value in my opinion.
[34:55] Store of value is if you look at price
[34:58] action the more important thing. um we
[35:00] we have I don't know $500 trillion
[35:03] problem with store of value that's like
[35:05] the total addressable market and then
[35:07] there's maybe like another 50 trillion
[35:10] or like 100 trillion maybe I don't know
[35:12] like whatever the amount is for medium
[35:14] of exchange so the amount the
[35:16] opportunity for store value is way
[35:18] bigger than the med of exchange side of
[35:21] things but a lot of but I think the
[35:22] medium of exchange side of things is
[35:25] important for bitcoin capturing the
[35:29] whole store of value side of things. So
[35:31] as you said the combination is the
[35:33] beauty have now gold with fiat together.
[35:37] That's why we have the 500 600 700
[35:40] trillion opportunity with Bitcoin just a
[35:43] store of value that is just gold and
[35:45] it's just outperforming everything.
[35:47] Yeah, it's probably still a really big
[35:50] asset. Probably the biggest one.
[35:52] Probably like uh 2x bigger than the 10
[35:55] next biggest ones. But it's also used as
[35:57] a medium of exchange and unit of
[35:59] account. This will this will make
[36:01] Bitcoin such a even way bigger asset. I
[36:04] have to dive deeper in my third episode
[36:06] with Jeff Pu on that. I did a second one
[36:08] with him and he'll on this in the second
[36:10] one. He said exactly that if Bitcoin
[36:13] fails at a medium of exchange, it also
[36:15] will fail as a as a as a store of value.
[36:17] And I'm I'm not fully with him on that.
[36:19] And I didn't dig deep enough on on the
[36:22] second one because I think Jeff Poof is
[36:24] one amazing thought leader in Bitcoin.
[36:28] He's he's always like five steps ahead
[36:30] of of of most people. So I want to dig
[36:33] deeper in his theory around that. So I'm
[36:35] not fully with him. I think even if
[36:37] Bitcoin is never any medium exchange,
[36:40] which we already have like we already
[36:42] have medium of exchange side of things,
[36:43] but even if this goes away again, there
[36:46] will still be some market for Bitcoin as
[36:48] a store of value. I just think with
[36:50] medium exchange, it will be
[36:52] significantly bigger. So I do think we
[36:55] need both of them and if we have both of
[36:57] them, the unit of account will just come
[36:59] automatically. We will I mean that's
[37:01] what the layer 2 is for. That's what the
[37:03] medium exchange layer 2 lightning
[37:06] network you know liquid whatever that is
[37:08] leave that over there. We have the
[37:10] triflin dilemma you know do you want
[37:12] speed do you want security or do you
[37:15] want uh
[37:16] decentralization and you know pick you
[37:19] know pick two so we pick security and
[37:22] decentralization and let layer 2 handle
[37:24] the fast transactions visa-like actions
[37:27] and stuff like that. Robin, let me ask
[37:29] you, the hottest thing this week is the
[37:32] dust up in the um battle royale and
[37:35] Bitcoin core and the debate between
[37:38] whether people are putting basically
[37:41] graffiti or junk inside of the Bitcoin
[37:44] blockchain. Have you heard about that?
[37:46] Yeah, I mean uh I think the first time
[37:48] this debate kind of came up with like
[37:50] ordinance and and and I think it was
[37:53] like I think yeah what was it was it
[37:55] 2021 or 2022 somewhere along those
[37:58] lines. It's it's it it comes up again
[38:01] now. Um but the the spam on Bitcoin and
[38:05] what should we build put on Bitcoin
[38:07] blockchain is a long debate already. I
[38:10] have I have two takes on that. The first
[38:12] thing is I think Bitcoin is money and
[38:14] should be used as money and everything
[38:16] that is not money doesn't serve the
[38:18] purpose the original purpose of Bitcoin.
[38:20] But also if a little bit graffiti on the
[38:23] blockchain of Bitcoin will bring Bitcoin
[38:25] down then it never was as good as we
[38:27] thought it is. So Bitcoin has to
[38:29] withstand those small I don't want to
[38:32] even call them attacks. But if if
[38:35] Bitcoin cannot handle this like what is
[38:37] Bitcoin then? Bitcoin will power through
[38:39] there. Bitcoin lived through way worse
[38:42] at the block size. I was really really
[38:44] really really
[38:46] really bad. Yeah, I was there for that.
[38:49] Yeah, that's when I basically like my
[38:51] introduction I was came in right in the
[38:53] midst of all of that and like Roger Vir
[38:56] I actually interviewed Roger Vir and uh
[38:58] Mexico and Narapoco 2018 and it's like
[39:01] right after this this stuff I'm going to
[39:03] repost it one of these days but the
[39:05] blocks it was a very uncertain time.
[39:09] which way is this going to go? Because
[39:10] even Lyn Alden was like when she was
[39:12] looking at it at that time, you know,
[39:14] she didn't make a choice left or right,
[39:17] she wanted to see how it played out and
[39:19] it it was resilient. Like you said, it
[39:21] survived and it it they went the right
[39:24] way. But my problem is my concern is the
[39:27] thing that makes Bitcoin beautiful is
[39:30] the trustless factor. Trustless sounds
[39:32] like a bad thing, but it's actually a
[39:34] good thing because I don't have to trust
[39:36] you. You don't have to trust me. We
[39:37] trust the system, right? You remove the
[39:40] human element of it in which you can be
[39:43] corrupted or make errors or be
[39:45] errorprone, right? Rules with no rulers.
[39:48] This is the beauty of it. Now, it's
[39:50] almost like an attack vector to have
[39:53] these programmers, you know, Bitcoin
[39:55] core programmers because we're relying
[39:57] on these people at the end of the day.
[39:59] People ask me like, "Well, what if
[40:01] somebody forces people put a gun to
[40:04] their head or other pressures? I tied
[40:06] your family up in the basement. Put this
[40:08] in the code. You know, there's whole
[40:10] types of propaganda and uh scops that
[40:13] happen that, you know, even we get
[40:16] fooled by. So, you know, the to make
[40:20] things look like it's okay. these things
[40:22] that are introduced like this, the
[40:24] little graffiti on here. I think these
[40:26] are small like mission creep type things
[40:29] like okay get them to accept a small yes
[40:32] and then a medium yes and then a bigger
[40:34] yes even if it's like 10 years from now
[40:37] you know that's why we have to nip this
[40:39] in the bud. I think we have to be
[40:41] vigilant because the human aspect is the
[40:44] attack vector on Bitcoin. In my opinion,
[40:48] it's only and you're very right because
[40:51] Bitcoin is most importantly a social
[40:53] revolution, not a technical one. Of
[40:56] course, we need a technical revolution
[40:57] on it, but you can copy the Bitcoin code
[41:00] oneonone tomorrow, put a different name
[41:03] on it, and nobody will buy it because
[41:06] it's not about the open- source code or
[41:09] improving that code. It's about what
[41:11] Bitcoin is is really the I have to quote
[41:16] Jeff Poof again and and he says it a
[41:18] lot. We are Bitcoin. We are the social
[41:22] revolution behind Bitcoin. Each and
[41:24] every single node, each and every single
[41:26] person is so important in Bitcoin. So it
[41:30] absolutely does matter what are we
[41:32] saying and what are we doing in Bitcoin
[41:34] and what are we allowing. That's why and
[41:36] I love that you brought about uh this
[41:38] small nipping. That's why yeah maybe not
[41:41] it's not a problem to increase the block
[41:44] size a little bit like let's say let's
[41:47] do it like 5x or like 7x something like
[41:51] that. It it might not actually be that
[41:54] bad, but what if we increase it then
[41:57] again and again because we already
[41:59] increase it once and then you have more
[42:01] and more increasing and all of the
[42:02] sudden you're in a situation where only
[42:05] big players can run a full note and then
[42:08] all of a sudden we are no longer
[42:09] decentralized, right? So those small
[42:12] things opening a small door can be very
[42:16] bad for Bitcoin. Like having like some
[42:18] small virus in your system and that's
[42:21] virus spreading within the system all of
[42:23] a sudden all of a sudden the whole thing
[42:26] falls down because one small virus was
[42:28] let in at the door. That's why it was so
[42:30] crucial that we did not let this block
[42:33] size were in with a small increase. And
[42:36] yeah you can even make an argument
[42:37] logical one. Yeah, like the price of how
[42:40] the price of one terabyte of storage
[42:43] fell down in in time because it gets
[42:45] cheaper then yeah we can also increase
[42:47] the block size. No, we should not like
[42:49] why should we increase the block size?
[42:51] What what what argument is there to
[42:54] actually increase it? So in in the same
[42:56] way we should tackle all all the things
[42:59] and and we'll be really vigilant with
[43:01] everything that people are putting on
[43:04] top of Bitcoin and doing with Bitcoin
[43:06] and we have to be very careful right
[43:08] now. I don't see it as as a problem
[43:10] because they don't really change the the
[43:13] protocol right now. They just like
[43:15] putting data on the blockchain which
[43:17] they have to pay for which now is super
[43:19] cheap. That's why I will use Bitcoin
[43:21] onchain transactions. Currently when I
[43:23] send a,000 uh euros in bitcoin it cost
[43:27] me like 70 cent and that's nothing. If I
[43:29] would do the same thing I actually I
[43:32] have the great example because I have
[43:34] two freelancers one I pay in bitcoin one
[43:36] in fiat. The one I pay in bitcoin cost
[43:38] me for the transaction 70s. The one in
[43:42] euros costs me €5 something and he also
[43:46] has to pay on his end then €10. That's
[43:49] like 15 of fee because he's Yeah. Uh in
[43:52] Colombia and I'm in Austria. In Bitcoin,
[43:54] it's just.7 cents no matter where he is.
[43:57] It doesn't really not matter what
[43:58] country. Currently, the the the
[44:01] transaction fees are really really low
[44:03] and they will not stay forever that low
[44:05] obviously and that's why those things
[44:08] are there and it's it's a problem, but I
[44:10] don't think it's a block size war
[44:13] problem currently. Yeah, for sure. For
[44:16] sure. All right. Is there anything else
[44:17] you wanted to talk about? Anything on
[44:19] your mind you wanted to let the people
[44:21] know? I think it's important if you're
[44:23] listening to a Bitcoin podcast that you
[44:26] realize that Bitcoin is a social
[44:29] revolution as we said and that you can
[44:32] take part in this social revolution in
[44:34] whatever way you want. So, not everyone
[44:37] has to work full-time in Bitcoin because
[44:40] there are not that many jobs in Bitcoin
[44:42] that everyone can could work in that.
[44:43] And Bitcoin end of the day is just money
[44:45] and you should use it and not work in
[44:47] it. Whatever you're doing, if you are a
[44:50] mechanical engineer repairing old-timer
[44:52] cars, you can also be a part of the
[44:55] Bitcoin revolution, when you are
[44:56] stacking Bitcoin, when you're orange
[44:58] billing your customers, when you're
[45:00] talking with your family about Bitcoin.
[45:02] We are all offline. We're all like
[45:05] offline or online soldiers in this
[45:08] information war for Bitcoin. And we can
[45:10] also play our part without being on
[45:13] Bitcoin podcast, without being on
[45:15] conferences, on stage or whatever. So I
[45:18] think that's a very important message
[45:20] that whatever you're doing, you can play
[45:23] your little part in Bitcoin. If you
[45:26] think Bitcoin is the winning horse and
[45:29] you think it's the best horse in in
[45:32] town, why not? Why not play a part in
[45:35] that? So that horse actually succeeds.
[45:37] so that we get the good holes and not
[45:39] the bad holes. Yeah, I think having
[45:43] having some impact in Bitcoin does not
[45:45] need you you don't have to write a
[45:47] Bitcoin book to have an impact on
[45:49] Bitcoin. Maybe just write it on a small
[45:51] article that you like. Send it to some
[45:54] magazine. Maybe they just pick it up.
[45:56] They do that. If it's a good article so
[45:58] you can play a part journey on a
[46:02] absolutely you can easily do that. Yeah.
[46:04] like just an X is
[46:06] like you you just you can just share it
[46:09] and and people I have a maybe that's an
[46:10] encouraging me message when I started
[46:12] with X I started posting every day on on
[46:15] X back in the day it was called Twitter
[46:18] and I had around 400 followers and a
[46:22] local news an actually like an economic
[46:26] uh newspaper which is here for like 50
[46:29] years and has a big big audience
[46:31] actually uh in the European market that
[46:34] one tweet up because that one tweet all
[46:36] of the sudden got a lot of attention and
[46:38] they made a whole page with an interview
[46:42] for me because it they made a series on
[46:44] why are people investing in Bitcoin and
[46:46] what are like real world people that are
[46:49] not like Michael Sailor thinking about
[46:51] Bitcoin was never again in any newspaper
[46:54] but this was the first and last time so
[46:56] far that I was with Bitcoin in news in a
[46:58] newspaper and I had 400 followers on
[47:00] Twitter so I was definitely not known at
[47:03] at all. I had no podcast, nothing else.
[47:05] I just had the Twitter channel, nothing
[47:07] else at all. And there was one tweet
[47:09] that went really good and and uh I I got
[47:13] an I requested per email saying like,
[47:15] "Hey, do you want to be featured in an
[47:17] interview series and they interviewed me
[47:19] like one and a half hours on the phone
[47:21] and it was a great article."
[47:25] Even people always think, "Oh, I need to
[47:28] have at least 10,000 followers. I need
[47:30] to have at least that that that amount."
[47:32] No, you can just do it. Just go and ask
[47:34] and post like what? And you don't even
[47:37] have to use a real name. You can just
[47:38] use some uh some fantasy name. So you
[47:41] you don't have to dox yourself. You you
[47:43] can stay private and still be full
[47:45] Bitcoin. That's a Bitcoiny thing, right?
[47:48] You could just do stuff. Absolutely. And
[47:50] you don't have to do it online also.
[47:51] Like if you really don't want to be
[47:53] involved in social media, I get that.
[47:55] Then just do it offline. Like talk about
[47:57] Bitcoin with your friends, your family.
[47:59] That's that's probably the best thing
[48:01] anyone can do. Orange building their
[48:03] loved ones. If if you know there's a
[48:05] flood coming, don't you want everyone to
[48:07] be on a boat? If you do not advocate for
[48:10] wife to be in a boat, for your kids to
[48:12] be on the boat, for your mom, for your
[48:14] dad, for your uncle, for your cousin to
[48:16] be on that very boat, don't you want to
[48:19] take like if if you don't want that,
[48:21] then there's something wrong with you, I
[48:22] think. Yes. I've been trying to uh
[48:24] orange pill my family for about eight
[48:26] years. a couple of them. My sister
[48:28] actually took the orange pill, which is
[48:30] good. But, uh, one's a realtor, uh,
[48:32] Cadia. What's up, Cadra? She's, uh,
[48:35] she's always got some kickback for me.
[48:37] But what I say is just look look around.
[48:39] Maybe you haven't peaked in on Bitcoin
[48:41] in the last five, two, one year,
[48:43] whatever, in a while. Look around. The
[48:46] the government's totally flipped their
[48:48] stance on it. They're embracing it. Hey,
[48:50] did you know there's a Bitcoin reserve
[48:52] Trump just put in? Hey, did you know
[48:54] they're repealing all of these uh choke
[48:57] 2.0 choke point 2.0 laws they had on
[49:00] Bitcoin? You know, hey, did you know
[49:02] there's a ETF that you can just buy
[49:04] Bitcoin on the stock market? A lot of
[49:06] people don't know these things that we
[49:08] just kind of take for granted because
[49:09] we're like glued to Twitter X all day.
[49:12] Hey, did you know that this country is
[49:14] buying it? Did you know El Salvador it's
[49:16] it's it's, you know, it's standardized
[49:19] currency there and all of these things,
[49:22] you know, Bhutan. Hey, did you know
[49:24] Putin and China, they're trading in
[49:25] Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? We
[49:28] haven't had this amount of tailwinds
[49:30] ever. It's the most bullish news I've
[49:33] ever seen since like got into the game
[49:35] in 2017. Imagine this news 2017. We
[49:39] would have went straight to 100K.
[49:41] Straight from like 2K to Okay, no
[49:44] problem. No problemmo. So, what I
[49:47] believe is they gave up the ghost
[49:49] already. The answers is already here.
[49:52] the uh bitcoin has won already but
[49:54] people don't know it because one is
[49:57] saying that we need a bitcoin reserve
[49:59] why why you just any answer that you
[50:02] give in the positive is already an
[50:04] assertion that the dollar is not
[50:06] significant enough or sufficient right
[50:09] and then the other thing is what Michael
[50:11] is doing he's financially engineering
[50:13] this he's offering better he's taking
[50:16] away the volatility and offering
[50:18] offering these fixed financial products
[50:20] in the form of convertible debt and
[50:22] other things offerings like strike and
[50:24] strife at a rate at rates that are
[50:26] blowing away the competition. Usually
[50:28] these corporations would get these kind
[50:31] of corporate bonds for 5% something
[50:34] around that. He's offering 30 35 you
[50:37] know you can share in in the upside. I
[50:39] mean it's not even a question when you
[50:42] compare the two. So, and he's giving
[50:44] them all different price points and
[50:46] different options and he's addressing
[50:48] very distinct portions of the market and
[50:52] he's just like you said, he's opening
[50:53] this black hole to let the capital flood
[50:56] in. And what is that doing? That's
[50:58] setting the precedent. Well, this
[51:00] financial structure is built on Bitcoin.
[51:03] It's built on rock. It's built on
[51:05] granite. They they gave up the ghost
[51:07] already is what I'm saying. It's it it's
[51:10] already they've admitted that what we
[51:12] have now is not sufficient. It's already
[51:15] won. And it and and Sailor's proving
[51:18] this by the way he's handling doing the
[51:20] convertible debt offerings and how it's
[51:23] outperforming traditional finance when
[51:26] now we have uh 21 Capital coming in. You
[51:29] know, Cantor Fitzgerald with Jack Marers
[51:32] as the CEO um you know to compete with
[51:35] Michael Sailor. I put a post up there. I
[51:37] was like, "Hey, sellers just thinking,
[51:39] come on, compete with me, guys." You
[51:41] know, he put the playbook out there,
[51:42] right? It wasn't for nothing. Come on,
[51:44] compete with me. That's what I want.
[51:46] Because when you compete with me, I'm
[51:48] going to get stronger. You're going to
[51:50] make the price go up. You're going to
[51:52] take it off the market, right? And if
[51:54] you don't compete with me, you're going
[51:56] to be weaker. You're going to die. And
[51:58] it's just going to become more salient,
[52:00] more crystallized, more clearer for it.
[52:03] For the people in the cheap seats, even
[52:05] they can see it. people in the peanut
[52:07] gallery that aren't too smart. Everyone
[52:10] layman's they'll they'll be able to see
[52:12] well you know I used to save I used to
[52:14] have a bank account that would give me
[52:16] 0.05%
[52:17] 05% what in the savings right and then
[52:20] and inflation is what crazy they say
[52:23] it's 3% but it's really like 20% in my
[52:26] opinion it's off the hook it's off the
[52:28] chain you can't the new hurdle rate just
[52:30] like the show from the um MSTR boys the
[52:34] hurdle rate the new hurdle rate is
[52:36] Bitcoin's kagger year-over-year if
[52:38] you're not beating that I don't you know
[52:40] what's to talk about you have to have a
[52:42] really great idea 90% of companies fail
[52:45] after 5 years That's just a fact. So is
[52:47] it more risky to get buy Bitcoin or is
[52:50] it less risky to buy Bitcoin? It's
[52:52] looking more and more every day it's
[52:54] less risky. If you look at portfolios
[52:56] sharp ratio after 20 I think after 20
[53:00] years it's just going to be hard to to
[53:03] it's going to
[53:04] be a risk to your career if you don't
[53:07] have Bitcoin or you don't recommend
[53:09] Bitcoin or why didn't you you know your
[53:12] customers and clients why why didn't you
[53:14] recommend this? How could you totally
[53:16] have missed this? How are you a
[53:18] financial advisor? Right? So, I think we
[53:21] already won. We already won. People just
[53:24] don't know it. Again, like Sailor says,
[53:26] you know, you want the thing that's
[53:27] unstoppable, right? And people don't
[53:30] understand it yet. And that's that's the
[53:32] thing. You don't sell the winner to buy
[53:34] the losers. That's my thing. So, just to
[53:37] switch to that real quick, what do you
[53:39] think about 21 Capital with Mullers?
[53:42] It's as as I said in the in the
[53:43] beginning, it's it's a strategy. Finally
[53:46] get competition, real competition maybe.
[53:48] Let's see what they are able to do. I
[53:50] think Chick Mala said in an interview
[53:52] that he wants to acquire more Bitcoin
[53:56] than than Strategy has. I'm not 100%
[53:59] sure. I just I think I saw a clip on on
[54:01] on Twitter he said something like that,
[54:03] but I could imagine that he says
[54:04] something like that. I'm not sure he can
[54:06] actually do that. I think sailor and
[54:08] strategy has uh a massive advantage,
[54:12] massive massive first move advantage. So
[54:15] yeah, let's see what what happens. The
[54:17] bigger bigger point here is there will
[54:19] come a lot of competition. 21 Capital is
[54:22] just the first real one. Obviously there
[54:24] are publicly traded companies that do
[54:26] similar things with similar scientific
[54:28] and and stuff like that where public
[54:30] traded companies are buying Bitcoin
[54:32] using financial engineering. But
[54:35] Benjamin Capital with that focus on like
[54:38] acquiring Bitcoin and using the fear
[54:40] system that's really really cool to see
[54:43] and I'm just looking forward to see how
[54:46] those two companies will be in 10 years.
[54:48] Both companies probably will do very
[54:50] good even though and I always say that I
[54:53] only hold Bitcoin. I follow Michael
[54:55] Sailor's advice to buy directly Bitcoin
[54:57] and not strategy B. And I think this is
[55:00] for me that sen moment of I have
[55:02] Bitcoin. I have it in cold storage. I
[55:05] have it for myself. I'm 100% in Bitcoin.
[55:08] Not more, not less. And and just living
[55:10] my life and and focusing on on what I
[55:13] can do for the community. That's
[55:15] awesome. That's awesome. Um I think this
[55:18] is a good place to end it, but before we
[55:20] get out of here, just like we said, the
[55:22] governments are adopting it. We have all
[55:24] these tailwinds at our back. I mean,
[55:27] it's just feels like takeoff time. The
[55:29] M2, we're about to catch up to the M2
[55:32] global money supply. Everybody's
[55:34] thinking it's a up, you know, in May, up
[55:36] in June. Some people saying the cycles
[55:38] are dead. The Bitcoin cycle, four-year
[55:40] cycle is dead. I think it'll just have
[55:43] less effect. But let's just have fun
[55:45] because, you know, some pe, you know,
[55:48] uh, Kathy Woods just came out and upped
[55:50] her prediction to 2.5 million per
[55:53] Bitcoin and 2030. I've even heard some
[55:56] some one of the Bitcoiners I follow, he
[55:59] 70 billion for Bitcoin per Bitcoin. I
[56:02] don't know what year he he had it at,
[56:04] but uh let's let's Robin, let's hear
[56:07] your take your price prediction. Here's
[56:08] where's Bitcoin going to be? I I I
[56:10] recently put a tweet out saying uh
[56:13] 0.1 Bitcoin will retire your whole
[56:16] family and one Bitcoin is FU money. uh
[56:20] and and everything above that is just
[56:22] generational wealth for for forever
[56:24] probably. I think most Bitcoiners are
[56:27] too bearish on Bitcoin. Most people
[56:30] completely underestimate it in the long
[56:32] run. I'm thinking 20, 30, 50 years from
[56:35] now. Then always people come to me, I
[56:37] will be dead in 50 years. First of all,
[56:39] you don't know that. How will you know
[56:40] that you're actually dead in 50 years?
[56:42] Maybe medical things advance. Maybe your
[56:45] head gets screwed on a robot once it's
[56:47] dead and you can live forever. You have
[56:49] no clue if you're actually dead in 50
[56:51] years. Even if you're 80 years old now,
[56:53] you have no clue if you're actually dead
[56:55] in 50 years. There's a lot possible with
[56:58] modern medicine. But outside of that,
[57:01] even if you're dead in 50 years, it's
[57:02] still important to acknowledge where
[57:04] does this thing go long term. And
[57:07] because of your more short-term or
[57:09] medium-term question of like 5 years in
[57:11] 2030, I think it it's really hard to say
[57:14] where Bitcoin will go. It can be at um
[57:17] let's say half a million. It can be at 5
[57:19] million. The range is really big for me
[57:21] short term because there there's a lot
[57:23] of things that can happen along the way.
[57:26] What if Apple decides next year to put
[57:29] half the balance sheet in Bitcoin? I
[57:30] don't think this will happen, but then I
[57:32] think we will be way beyond a million in
[57:35] 2030. So, uh it it all depends on on on
[57:39] on short-term factors that are not in
[57:42] our control. And we we try we want to
[57:45] put labels and and and we want to put
[57:47] some models on top of Bitcoin. We had
[57:50] the the power law. We had plan B the
[57:52] stock toflow model. We have so many
[57:53] different models. Michael Sailor also
[57:56] put a model out there. Ky Wood was like
[57:58] all those great people put their own
[58:00] models on top of Bitcoin. But at the end
[58:02] of the day and Michael actually says
[58:05] that once once a big enough player comes
[58:07] in all your models are destroyed.
[58:09] Godzilla steps on the playground.
[58:12] Absolutely. all your models are
[58:13] destroyed. Yeah. If you play I for if
[58:16] you play soccer in in a in a like a
[58:20] small league where there's like not not
[58:22] a lot of talents in there and they're
[58:23] all doing it as a hobby and then you
[58:26] exchange the one team where all the star
[58:29] players are, they will destroy the other
[58:31] team and the outcome will could be
[58:33] completely different. So once the once
[58:35] the big players come into Bitcoin and
[58:38] they already starting to pile in now
[58:39] they are towing in. They are testing the
[58:42] waters. Black Rockck is testing the
[58:44] waters. America is testing the waters.
[58:46] The big players are just testing the
[58:48] waters right now. And there's a lot of
[58:49] big players like the magnificent Apple,
[58:53] Google, Facebook, all of those haven't
[58:55] even tested the water yet. We are so
[58:57] freaking early. But once they are doing
[59:00] like once one of the big seven says like
[59:02] we like Bitcoin and we put our bad
[59:04] energy on there all the other CFOs get
[59:06] the question like oh like what are you
[59:08] doing with Bitcoin and they're like oh
[59:09]  like now we have to do a bitcoin
[59:10] strategy all of the sudden what happens
[59:12] if Google app Tesla Tesla already did
[59:15] has some some small bitcoin strategy
[59:17] like what if they all went ahead and put
[59:20] 5% 10% 15% of their wealth in bitcoin
[59:23] this completely changes the game that is
[59:25] ridiculous to to to think that right? It
[59:29] just stays at that level and and 0.1
[59:32] Bitcoin will never be a lot. Most
[59:34] people, even Bitcoiners in the long run,
[59:37] too bearish on Bitcoin and sometimes a
[59:40] little bit too bullish on the short
[59:42] term. I feel like yeah, the
[59:43] possibilities are enormous. We can't
[59:45] even fathom when these things like just
[59:48] like you said, one company could just
[59:50] change everything. Even just the
[59:52] purchasing of uh for the reserve here in
[59:54] America could just start a flood of
[59:57] other chain reactions from other
[60:00] countries and nation states. You know,
[60:01] people are buying and then and then
[60:03] we'll have purchasing on the nation
[60:05] state level, the state level, the city
[60:08] level, the home office level, you know,
[60:10] the personal level, all at the same time
[60:13] all around the world globally. And uh I
[60:17] think we're in for a better, brighter
[60:19] future. Like I always say, come on over
[60:21] to Bitcoin. It's better over here. It's
[60:23] brighter. It's hope over here. And over
[60:26] there, it's a little bit dystopian, you
[60:29] know. I think that's a good place to end
[60:31] it. Robin, thanks for coming on. Always
[60:35] great talking to you. Always good
[60:37] energy. Always a good discussion. Let
[60:39] the people once again know where they
[60:41] can find you before we get out of here.
