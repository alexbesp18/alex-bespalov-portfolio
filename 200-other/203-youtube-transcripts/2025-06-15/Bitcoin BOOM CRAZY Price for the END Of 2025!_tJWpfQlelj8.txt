[00:00] Apple will probably just get bought out
[00:01] by micro strategy if they don't get on a
[00:03] Bitcoin standard those dollars are just
[00:04] going to dilute like a melting Ice Cube
[00:06] I'm incredibly bearish on Apple
[00:07] incredibly bearish on some of these
[00:09] other tech companies because they don't
[00:10] have Bitcoin on their balance sheet I do
[00:12] get that 2017 Feeling Again where it's
[00:14] like we get to January and it's like at
[00:16] 10K and then it starts growing growing
[00:18] growing growing and then before you know
[00:19] we're we're at 21k by the end of the
[00:21] year and I do get that sense next year
[00:23] where we just keep going going up
[00:24] throughout the year and we reach some
[00:26] crazy price at the end of the 2025 this
[00:29] cycle I'm seeing something a little bit
[00:30] different we're seeing a lot more trafi
[00:32] guys coming in from like the JP Morgans
[00:34] the Bloomberg's the fidelities
[00:36] Millennials get it we we grew up through
[00:37] the 2008 crash we we grew up through
[00:39] 9911 so we inherently don't trust our
[00:41] government we're going to see a ton of
[00:44] new Innovative um apps come
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] through hi kle how you doing pretty good
[00:53] doing pretty good it's a beautiful
[00:55] Wednesday morning here in Austin Texas
[00:58] very sunny it's a it's getting right
[01:00] around winter time so um everything's
[01:02] getting a little bit more colder and all
[01:04] that kind of stuff so it's great weather
[01:07] I heard that Austin I talked with with
[01:10] someone I forgot with whom I talked
[01:12] about that but I talked with someone
[01:14] from Austin recently and they said like
[01:16] oh Austin is kind of a Bitcoin City it's
[01:18] a lot happening there yeah uh it's
[01:21] there's right now we're inside of PL
[01:24] laab which is located at the Littlefield
[01:26] building in off of Sixth Street in
[01:27] Congress which is like the main uh area
[01:30] of town and then um right next door to
[01:33] us is Unchained and then right next door
[01:35] to us is the Bitcoin comment and so yeah
[01:37] we're we're we're we pretty much taken
[01:39] over this entire floor as bitcoiners uh
[01:41] in this building and the goal is at some
[01:44] point to take over the whole building
[01:45] which is like I think like 10 or 12 14
[01:48] stories something like that or floors I
[01:50] should say um wow yeah that's we have a
[01:54] we have a ton of meetups from here in
[01:58] Austin up north um pretty much the
[02:00] entire state of Texas is pretty flooded
[02:02] with meetups communities and different
[02:04] sorts of pockets but Austin is the most
[02:07] vibrant um I think in the United States
[02:09] as far as like concentrated concentrated
[02:11] amount of bitcoiners in different areas
[02:13] whether it's mining development startups
[02:16] um Capital um pretty much everywhere I
[02:19] would say how big are those those
[02:21] meetups are like the 50 people there or
[02:24] like 100 people there like how how big
[02:26] is I mean we'll start knowing here
[02:29] pretty soon but um last cycle it was
[02:32] like in the 150s to 200 for for meetups
[02:36] and I think as as a price keeps going up
[02:38] I think we'll start seeing more
[02:40] tomorrow's bit Dev so I'm pretty sure
[02:41] we'll see a lot more people tomorrow and
[02:43] then uh we have a we have an ausome
[02:45] Bitcoin club that we do once a month and
[02:47] that'll be probably even bigger than the
[02:49] bit devs and and then we have a design
[02:51] meet up a Austin Bitcoin design Club as
[02:54] well too so we have a lot of we have a
[02:56] lot of offerings here in Austin if
[02:57] you're a bitcoiner um stuff for the Plus
[03:00] stuff for the devs stuff for the U the
[03:02] creative people and then uh we have a
[03:04] good we have a good found a good
[03:06] Founders Network I would say especially
[03:08] Among Us uh bitcoiners who are doing
[03:10] startups so it's uh America in itself is
[03:15] a really interesting country to like has
[03:19] attracts a lot of talent attracts a lot
[03:21] of of people and I think Texas makes a
[03:24] really good case for Bitcoin to even
[03:26] like move there um especially like it's
[03:29] it's it's world country there's a lot of
[03:32] um development happening and now maybe
[03:34] with like even on a federal level if
[03:36] there's like a lot of uh positive change
[03:39] for Bitcoin happing and not not like
[03:41] hostile hostility towards it uh this is
[03:44] this would be major for America and also
[03:46] for taxes uh that's that's really great
[03:49] to see there I mean also in in the
[03:52] German speaking area there's a lot of
[03:53] great things happening but we have like
[03:55] meetups with like 30 40 50 people 50
[03:58] it's like when it's really big uh I mean
[04:00] is also like a small City but Vienna
[04:02] still has like uh 1.5 million people on
[04:05] there I don't know a how big is Austin
[04:07] actually it's actually a really small
[04:10] like uh kind of city it's a it's it's
[04:13] split into there's the middle like it's
[04:15] called 35 it's the interstate and then
[04:17] there's two halves there's the west side
[04:18] and the east side and then there's north
[04:20] of the river and south of the river and
[04:22] it's kind of split like a compass um so
[04:25] it's it's actually a very small used to
[04:27] be a pass through town where you would
[04:29] you pass through it to get to Dallas uh
[04:31] but these days it's uh it's becoming
[04:33] more of a destination for um for
[04:36] bitcoiners and Founders and developers
[04:39] who want to like interact with some of
[04:41] these other uh concentrated uh
[04:43] bitcoiners in this kind of this little
[04:45] area I would say at this point we have
[04:48] we probably have more at least here in
[04:50] the financial district downtown we
[04:52] probably have more Bitcoin companies
[04:54] than we do barbecue shops which is
[04:56] saying a lot because we have a lot of
[04:57] barbecue shops here in Austin Texas
[05:02] I just I just looked it up Austin is
[05:04] actually smaller than Vienna so this
[05:07] speaks speaks a lot like it's it's not
[05:09] that huge of a of a city um and it has
[05:14] way more people on the media a lot more
[05:16] happening and it just like gives me that
[05:19] overall vibe that America is also in the
[05:23] Bitcoin Revolution the same with
[05:25] internet Revolution just far ahead it's
[05:27] just way uh bigger than
[05:30] uh way bigger it is at the size where
[05:33] Europe should be like it should should
[05:35] Europe should take a lot of inspiration
[05:37] from that uh but they're not they're
[05:39] actually going in the in the different
[05:40] direction of that and I really don't
[05:42] like that but uh it's it's great to see
[05:45] that that there's things happening in
[05:47] America what's your current like in
[05:49] America a lot of things happened this
[05:51] year with the ETF we had brought of C
[05:54] the Bitcoin Haring now we had the
[05:55] election with with Trump everything like
[05:57] what's the what's the current state for
[05:59] you and what what's what do you make of
[06:00] all the things that happened this year
[06:03] yeah I think for me I can kind of
[06:04] separate the the the the politics and
[06:07] all that stuff from what I do on a daily
[06:09] basis but looking at it from like my
[06:11] personal lens I think it's all good for
[06:13] Bitcoin I think overall uh we were in a
[06:16] situation where the previous uh um
[06:20] cabinet or whatever you want to call
[06:22] them in in office were uh probably not
[06:24] doing right by by Americans uh and so I
[06:27] think it was it was a definitely a
[06:29] change that we needed to see one way or
[06:30] another um however you feel about it I
[06:33] think that's just the overall kind of
[06:35] hard truth to it all um and I I think
[06:38] things are are are very positive right
[06:40] now in America at least here in Texas I
[06:42] know here in Austin and specifically
[06:45] what we do here like um there have been
[06:47] bitcoiners building here since about
[06:49] 2015 2013 um you know back when uh
[06:54] Pierre Rashard and and and bit Stein
[06:57] started it you know out of UT so it um
[07:00] and and I've heard even stories that I
[07:02] went beyond that too as well so I think
[07:04] I think I think here in Austin
[07:06] especially especially in Texas I think
[07:08] Bitcoin has been a thing for a really
[07:09] long time uh even in the in the 2010s
[07:12] and I think um there has always been a
[07:14] concentrated amount of bitcoiners uh
[07:17] because I think Texas just in general
[07:18] Falls in with the same kind of ethos as
[07:21] Bitcoin when it comes to Freedom when it
[07:22] comes to self-sovereignty and it comes
[07:24] to um being able to transact freely with
[07:27] whoever you want I think we I think we
[07:29] uh as a state you kind of get you kind
[07:32] of get that ingrained um when you're
[07:34] taking Texas history and Elementary and
[07:37] and middle school and stuff like that
[07:38] you're kind of you're kind of taught
[07:39] these things at an early age in Texas as
[07:42] a student so um I think that's why when
[07:44] I I think that's why I think we see a
[07:46] lot of bitcoiners here in Texas is
[07:49] because um a lot of what we have going
[07:51] on here um there's just enough room for
[07:54] for for the pie to grow for everybody
[07:56] and I think um we all kind of moved
[07:58] together even though might not see each
[08:00] other or talk to each other all the time
[08:01] we all kind of have a good Baseline on
[08:04] things moving together forward uh at
[08:06] least in Texas but I think the rest of
[08:09] United States I think overall I think
[08:12] the I think everything has been a plus
[08:14] you know we're seeing in the price this
[08:16] week right I think we reached another
[08:17] new all-time high so um it's incredibly
[08:20] uh bullish if if you're working in
[08:22] Bitcoin right now if you're doing
[08:23] something around it it it's really hard
[08:26] for me these days because I usually
[08:28] record and then like one two some even
[08:31] three weeks after that I only publish it
[08:33] because I have a backlog
[08:35] uh I I sit there and edit and like oh we
[08:39] talked about a $773,000 price and now we
[08:42] are over 90,000 and I'm like oh
[08:44] like it seems like that episode is so
[08:46] old and sometimes I just cut out the the
[08:49] small pieces where we talk about price
[08:52] but yeah like we we sitting now at like
[08:54] uh 94 or something like that I think we
[08:57] hit briefly 9 5 what I heard but I'm not
[09:00] sure about that uh so yeah maybe when I
[09:03] release that we at like 110 or something
[09:05] like that would be fun to see it's uh
[09:08] it's it's wild man I think this this
[09:11] cycle has been a little bit different
[09:12] because we had such a horrible bar
[09:14] Market I think if you were if you were a
[09:16] company um building during this bare
[09:18] market like it was at least from what
[09:20] I've heard this is my first time
[09:21] building during it but from what I heard
[09:23] it was like the worst be Market since
[09:25] like the teens to build in so um I'm I'm
[09:30] very much looking forward to to what
[09:32] we've been experiencing the past month
[09:34] or so because after a while it can just
[09:36] become very uh very
[09:39] dark do you expect do you expect from
[09:42] that also uh a bigger bull market
[09:46] because we have kind of uh so much
[09:48] potential and it was kind of like stuck
[09:50] in there and now the champagne ptle uh
[09:54] pops yeah I think I I don't like to give
[09:56] predictions and but just this this is
[09:59] personally what how what I think I I
[10:01] don't not speaking for ple blab or
[10:03] anything but I think personally I I just
[10:05] I kind of I get the feeling that and
[10:08] these are just like abstract feelings
[10:11] nothing for sure and there's no nothing
[10:13] I see there but I I do get the feeling
[10:14] that we're going to be
[10:16] pumping um you know pretty much all year
[10:19] next year I I do get that 2017 Feeling
[10:22] Again where it's like you know we we get
[10:24] to January and it's like at 10K and then
[10:27] it just like you know or it's at 7K or
[10:28] whatever was in 2017 and then it just
[10:30] starts growing growing growing growing
[10:32] and then before you know we're we're at
[10:34] 21k by the end of the year and I do get
[10:36] that sense next year where like maybe we
[10:38] start off at 70 or 80 or whatever it is
[10:41] and then we just keep going going up
[10:43] throughout the year and we reach some
[10:45] crazy price at the end of the of 2025 I
[10:48] do think that is a possibility but these
[10:51] are
[10:52] just just
[10:54] feelings where do you think the this
[10:57] next wave of Bitcoin at up outside of
[11:00] the Bitcoin price uh like really like
[11:02] the what the next like story of Bitcoin
[11:05] the next adoption wave of Bitcoin the
[11:08] next people that come in Bitcoin yeah I
[11:11] I mean I couldn't tell you on the on the
[11:13] buying side but I can tell you from what
[11:15] I do on a daily basis which is like PL
[11:16] laab and um what we do is we work with
[11:19] Founders and early stage startups and we
[11:21] try to get them to to success and what I
[11:24] what I saw last cycle was a little bit
[11:25] different I saw a lot of people coming
[11:27] in from the general Tech space whether
[11:29] that was Google or Apple or you know
[11:32] Adobe or PayPal they were coming in to
[11:35] start building on bitcoin like it was a
[11:37] that's where a lot of Founders were
[11:38] coming from at least from from what I
[11:40] was seeing on the ground here in Austin
[11:42] and I think um this cycle I'm seeing
[11:44] something a little bit different I'm I'm
[11:46] seeing we're seeing a lot more trafi
[11:48] guys coming in from like the JP Morgans
[11:51] the Bloomberg's the um you know the
[11:54] Vitality like I'm seeing more of these
[11:56] type of guys come in this cycle who want
[11:58] to do their own campaign
[11:59] and I think that's the biggest
[12:02] difference that I've seen this cycle
[12:04] compared to last cycle last cycle felt
[12:05] more Tech oriented people coming in to
[12:08] build Bitcoin companies and this this
[12:10] cycle feels like more General like
[12:12] traditional Finance um individuals that
[12:15] are wanting to go off and see if they
[12:17] can have a go at it you know this cycle
[12:19] and and that's kind of where I'm seeing
[12:21] a lot of like the the the building
[12:24] happening I think the the other
[12:26] interesting thing
[12:27] is I do feel Bitcoin is at this level
[12:31] where I don't know if the mainstream
[12:33] will ever get it as far as like um some
[12:36] of the nuances and stuff like that so I
[12:38] do think there there will definitely
[12:39] need to be some some easier onboarding
[12:42] when it comes to um you know onboarding
[12:45] these uh you know these um you know
[12:48] these uh these Generation Z I guess you
[12:52] could call them I forget what they're
[12:53] called but um I think you're I think
[12:54] you're going to need I think it's going
[12:55] to require a different sort of like uh
[12:58] onboarding um to to get them because I
[13:00] do think they're a different um sort of
[13:05] of um generation that are going to
[13:08] require different uh expectations when
[13:11] it comes to bitcoin and I when I when I
[13:12] see the millennial generation at least
[13:14] here in America uh a lot of a lot of the
[13:17] Bitcoin stuff I think we inherently get
[13:19] because you know we got priced out when
[13:20] it comes to housing or when it comes to
[13:23] you know holding on to traditional
[13:25] stocks or stuff like that I think
[13:27] Millennials get it we we grew up through
[13:28] the 2008 crash we we grew up through 911
[13:31] so a lot of the stuff we inherently
[13:33] don't trust our government if you grew
[13:35] up during that time um and I think uh I
[13:39] think but I do think that the the
[13:40] Generation Z I do think they are going
[13:42] to require a different sort of
[13:43] onboarding to get them into Bitcoin and
[13:46] I think that's going to come through a
[13:47] wave of new types of apps um and and
[13:50] that's kind of kind of what I'm getting
[13:52] at I think there's I think there's going
[13:54] to be a new way to onboard some of these
[13:55] types of individuals that will uh kind
[13:58] of y their brains into thinking in like
[14:01] sat
[14:02] denominations that's super interesting
[14:04] and yeah it's called generation uh C
[14:07] like Set uh I know it because I'm still
[14:10] in it okay I'm I'm the higher end of it
[14:14] uh two years older than I would be
[14:16] Millennials uh I think it's from 12 to
[14:19] 27 years old right now so so that that's
[14:23] kind of the age range what got you into
[14:26] Bitcoin it's really interesting because
[14:29] when you look at the demographics of
[14:30] bitcoiners when I just look at my
[14:33] channel so my channel has around 50 to
[14:35] 100,000 bitcoiners watching every month
[14:39] uh and so it's like a good amount of
[14:41] people where you can extract already
[14:43] some statistics and I'm myself 26 years
[14:46] old and even though I'm So Young my
[14:50] audience is on average like 47 48 around
[14:55] 50 years old I Have I Told tell this all
[14:58] the time I have fre times more people
[15:00] above 65 than I have under my age so so
[15:05] that's that's huge I have like 0.2% of
[15:08] people under
[15:09] 18 so so like even though I'm young even
[15:13] though I'm gen Z there are so many older
[15:15] people that watch me older people just
[15:17] older than me uh so that that's super
[15:20] interesting what got me into Bitcoin I
[15:22] was into stocks and uh everyone kept
[15:26] bothering me in 2020 with Bitcoin like
[15:29] hey what your f000
[15:31] Bitcoin why why is Bitcoin uh and I was
[15:36] three years from 2017 to 2020 the um
[15:41] yeah I I really thought Bitcoin is a
[15:43] scam in three years straight and so
[15:46] people were also like why is Bitcoin a
[15:47] scam why do you believe that uh because
[15:50] it was really big on stocks uh on Tesla
[15:52] Apple Facebook all the tech stocks
[15:53] because I come from Tech uh and then
[15:57] like yeah at some point it just made
[15:59] sense to to look it up a little bit
[16:01] closer I told that story many times on
[16:03] the podcast so I will cut it a little
[16:04] bit short I basically had one weekend
[16:07] where someone in the week bothered me so
[16:10] much with Bitcoin I was like I want to
[16:13] prove him wrong and I also discovered
[16:15] that I was running out of arguments to
[16:17] make against Bitcoin when he was talking
[16:20] with me and so like Friday to Sunday I
[16:22] was like that's my Bitcoin weekend I
[16:24] will just gather all the information why
[16:25] Bitcoin is a scam yeah and on Monday I
[16:28] bought my first bit
[16:30] coins because I was discovering I was
[16:33] actually wrong uh so that's how I came
[16:37] into Bitcoin and ever since I I got into
[16:40] Bitcoin it took me then a year to go all
[16:42] in and then it took me one year more to
[16:45] also speak about Bitcoin and then one me
[16:48] one year more to start my podcast so
[16:51] that's kind of my story in Bitcoin and
[16:53] now one year later I'm I'm here and have
[16:56] my podcast yeah and I I think you have
[16:59] like close to 300 you said 300 plus
[17:03] episodes uh yeah now like 312 episodes
[17:07] yeah that's amazing it's absolutely
[17:09] amazing yeah but I think we need
[17:12] different um ways to get to geny um as
[17:16] you said like Millennials uh they they
[17:20] know they have they have a big pain
[17:24] point they know why they needed it and
[17:26] that's why Al that's such a huge cohort
[17:29] actually um who who are bitcoiners uh
[17:32] gen C especially like if you're like 20
[17:35] years old um most of them or are still
[17:40] living with the parents or maybe are
[17:42] just like now slowly slowly moving out
[17:45] they maybe in the students they're
[17:46] getting a lot of subsidies they're
[17:48] getting like a lot of uh still hand out
[17:50] money
[17:52] so they don't even think maybe too much
[17:55] about money so we really have to catch
[17:58] them differently and I should do that
[18:00] actually my a small cousin of mine is
[18:04] recently went into Bitcoin uh with like
[18:07] 17 years old uh so it would be really
[18:09] fun also to interview him because he's
[18:11] not so deep in the Bitcoin Community but
[18:13] he really saves all his money in Bitcoin
[18:16] it would be interesting to to get this
[18:19] um yeah but but back to you um what is
[18:21] kind of like your main mission in
[18:23] Bitcoin especially Al with with uh plab
[18:26] blab what you're building yeah I think I
[18:28] think for the most part I mean we
[18:29] started plab in 2021 and it was just a
[18:32] group of individuals that wanted to help
[18:34] each other um with their with their
[18:37] individual startups um at the time I was
[18:40] I was producing and working in um with
[18:42] other uh Bitcoin podcasts and I uh you
[18:46] know I it was like this kind of once in
[18:48] a lifetime opportunity where you know
[18:50] the Austin scene was getting bigger and
[18:52] bigger and bigger and uh me and a couple
[18:54] friends just happened to be running the
[18:56] the Meetup at the time the Bitcoin
[18:58] Meetup at the time which was Austin
[18:59] Bitcoin club and uh from that came out
[19:01] ple lab like U we we brought in a lot of
[19:04] people who went off and made some
[19:07] amazing um um you know startups and
[19:11] products in the space and I think at the
[19:13] time uh we were all just trying to like
[19:16] kind of help each other you know um as
[19:18] far as like accelerate our learning
[19:19] accelerate with each other accelerate
[19:21] our individual products and startups and
[19:24] and um I think everything kind of came
[19:25] to a head in early 22 when you know
[19:28] people came to us and they're like is
[19:30] plab going to raise money like would you
[19:32] guys raise money and at the time my
[19:34] co-founder wanted to do an accelerator
[19:36] because he was from San Francisco and
[19:37] had aspirations of doing something like
[19:39] that and I had no idea what any of that
[19:42] stuff was back then I was just kind of
[19:43] still green and um and it uh you know I
[19:48] I think at the time I I I think it was
[19:51] kind of good that it all played out the
[19:52] way it did because now here we are four
[19:55] years later and uh or two three years
[19:57] later and we're
[19:59] you know we're one of the Premier
[20:00] destinations to come to if you're going
[20:02] to do like a Bitcoin company um you know
[20:04] a lot of a lot of what we do nowadays is
[20:07] help these early stage startups and try
[20:09] to get them to success and what I mean
[20:11] by success is you know we want to get
[20:13] them to like a preed or if they're
[20:14] looking to get a grant or if they're
[20:16] just looking to bootstrap their business
[20:18] we want to help them achieve some sort
[20:21] of uh positive Revenue in that aspect so
[20:24] I I think my mission today is to find
[20:26] those individuals get them to Austin and
[20:29] and uh you know really help them get to
[20:33] the the dreams that they that they have
[20:34] and they want to build and I think
[20:36] everybody in the lab when we kind of
[20:38] come together collectively I think we
[20:40] all inherently just kind of feel and
[20:42] believe that and it's always been a
[20:44] really special thing at PL blab is you
[20:46] know um people just
[20:48] usually kind of just always want to we
[20:51] we just we just attract the right type
[20:53] of talent here I would say um there
[20:55] there's been some times in the past
[20:57] where you know people people are like
[20:59] how do you keep something like that you
[21:00] know special together for a really long
[21:02] time and I I think it really does start
[21:05] you know with um with the individuals in
[21:07] the room and everybody trying to help
[21:10] each other get to that that next level
[21:13] and um yeah it's been one of the most uh
[21:17] uh I would say at least for me
[21:19] personally I think it's one of the most
[21:21] significant things I've ever done in my
[21:22] life I don't I don't know of anything
[21:25] more impactful that I could be doing
[21:26] right now uh especially in Bitcoin
[21:29] um I I personally think that having more
[21:32] Bitcoin businesses is going to lead us
[21:33] time per Bitcoin isation I don't think
[21:35] that happens through
[21:38] um uh any other way I think I think you
[21:40] were going to have to replace a lot of
[21:42] these um or maybe not replace but at
[21:44] least Inspire some of these already
[21:46] existing um um individual companies and
[21:49] products and stores and and and the like
[21:52] uh to to adopt Bitcoin I think the only
[21:54] way to do that is to put pressure on on
[21:57] them in in the open market um so I I do
[22:01] think that um I do think that where we
[22:04] are this cycle I think that we're going
[22:06] to see a ton of new Innovative um apps
[22:09] come through and I think like we have
[22:12] one in in in house right now called
[22:14] jippy and they're working on a
[22:15] gamification app that's kind of building
[22:18] its the first kind of like Pokemon go
[22:20] for like Bitcoin which you know on the
[22:22] outside sounds kind of like you know
[22:25] like oh why would you build that but I
[22:26] think when we were talking early about
[22:29] you know trying to appeal to a different
[22:30] generation um you know the average
[22:32] attention span for some of these
[22:33] individuals is like less than six
[22:35] seconds right because they're swiping on
[22:37] Tik Tok and some of these other things
[22:38] I'm I'm as guilty of it as anybody else
[22:41] and so um I think in order to attract
[22:44] some of these newer bitcoiners that
[22:47] we're going to want to this next cycle
[22:48] um it's going to require a different
[22:49] sort of tool and I think that will be
[22:52] the G gamification of like everything
[22:54] and I think we're kind of already seeing
[22:56] that with like yop um and yopak is
[22:59] a company that is kind of doing
[23:01] something similar uh but they're they're
[23:03] they're they're targeting the Latin
[23:04] America and Mexico and stuff like that
[23:06] so I I do think there there will be
[23:09] these kind of new gamified type of apps
[23:11] that will really kind of push the the
[23:13] needle forward when it comes to
[23:15] adoption and uh for the listeners I had
[23:19] both Yaki and chipsy chipsy was it right
[23:23] both already on on the podcast so you
[23:26] actually can go ahead and and maybe
[23:28] maybe I link them somewhere uh if I
[23:30] forget you can just look it up in in in
[23:32] the in my uh yeah in my library of the
[23:35] podcast I had both already on and they
[23:37] really nice podcast with both of them it
[23:39] was really nice I think Oliver Porter
[23:41] was the one from uh Gypsy uh I don't
[23:45] remember because it's it's been a long
[23:47] while from from Yaki uh but but it was a
[23:51] great one also so yeah really really
[23:53] cool startups and you also have a
[23:55] program that you told me earlier about
[23:58] top Builders where you basically
[24:00] encourage people to get to that startup
[24:02] space from the project to to Startup and
[24:04] there's also even a prize to win for
[24:06] that yeah so we we last year we created
[24:09] this thing called top Builder so uh for
[24:12] people listening at home they're like
[24:13] What's top Builder it's um well let me
[24:16] kind of preface this by saying like um
[24:17] building on bitcoin is extremely hard um
[24:21] because trying to get to revenue um
[24:23] there's really small margins there there
[24:25] and there's really not not many ways of
[24:28] doing it um when it comes to get to
[24:30] getting to revenue for building your
[24:32] Bitcoin company U because a lot of this
[24:34] stuff is open source and you know freely
[24:36] available for anybody to download so you
[24:39] know um so there's that kind of hurdle
[24:41] you have to pass first um and then and
[24:44] then after that it's just you know the
[24:46] whole adoption thing that we just
[24:47] discussed right it's get user attaction
[24:50] get people get eyeballs get uh get all
[24:52] sorts of you know press whatever it is
[24:54] to take a look at your app is is a whole
[24:56] another thing so you when you put all
[24:58] these things together it's it's very
[25:00] hard to build a Bitcoin company not many
[25:01] people ask especially with these bare
[25:03] markets we were just talking about that
[25:04] earlier um you know that does become
[25:07] kind of a place when you should be
[25:09] building the hardest um but what happens
[25:12] is every three to four years we do get
[25:13] this incredible Bull Run that we're
[25:15] experiencing right now and then that
[25:17] that should help you um you know get to
[25:19] that next level so with all that being
[25:21] said we created something called top
[25:23] Builder and top Builder is like this the
[25:25] top chef for Bitcoin it's like trying to
[25:27] find Who's the who who's the best of the
[25:29] best when it comes to um to doing this
[25:32] and uh last year yop paky Francisco on
[25:35] um he beat out 32 no 31 other
[25:38] teams um a after about uh eight weeks
[25:43] and then um he presented here on Startup
[25:45] day here in Austin Texas and uh he won
[25:48] Top Builder he got pressed on CNBC um I
[25:52] think he I think he ended up um raising
[25:54] more money and and uh and so like a lot
[25:56] of great things came out of that for uh
[25:59] for him and his team and so we're going
[26:01] to do it again this year we want to make
[26:03] it just as big if not bigger and um
[26:05] right now you can head over to to
[26:07] builder. deev and you know read all the
[26:10] all the stuff that's in there we have
[26:12] judges we have mentorships it's a
[26:13] basically an eight-week program and over
[26:15] those eight weeks we try to find the
[26:17] best of the bestest and um after about
[26:20] the first round which is roughly around
[26:22] four weeks we cut the we cut the teams
[26:24] in half uh and then after about two more
[26:26] weeks we cut the teams in half again and
[26:28] try to get them down to five and then we
[26:30] bring those five to Austin to pitch in
[26:32] front of investors and and the ecosystem
[26:36] um worldwide so uh at some point I do
[26:39] think we'll we'll get to a place where
[26:41] we we'll bring them to like a we'll
[26:43] we'll actually recorded and make it into
[26:45] a TV show and it'll be like a whole
[26:46] thing but until we get to that place uh
[26:49] for right now it'll just be a uh it'll
[26:51] just be a competition um yeah and it's
[26:55] it's company so it's projects not
[26:58] companies like if you have already
[27:00] existing companies it's not for them
[27:02] yeah so we're we're genuinely I mean ple
[27:05] laab is well positioned and I would say
[27:08] probably uh the absolute best place to
[27:10] come for early stage companies um I
[27:13] think we offer the right amount of
[27:16] experience and the right amount of
[27:17] network and community and general
[27:19] support that you would need uh to
[27:22] elevate your your your idea or your
[27:24] project from like you know concept stage
[27:27] to full on hey let's go pitch this and
[27:30] see if we can have a go at it um right
[27:32] now during top Builder we prefer to look
[27:35] for those types for those types of
[27:36] people that really want to take that
[27:38] idea but we also do want people who are
[27:41] you know either are at a
[27:43] pre-stage uh or or in that kind of area
[27:46] or if it's just a general project that's
[27:48] looking for for funding with Grant
[27:50] support um that's trying to do it open
[27:52] source uh we want you to apply to as
[27:54] well so um usually usually how the
[27:57] process goes is you know they'll they'll
[27:59] complete the form if it if it um if it's
[28:02] not like a bot or something and it's
[28:04] actually a viable application we'll
[28:06] we'll schedule a call and then we'll
[28:07] have a conversation around uh kind of
[28:09] goals and Milestones that they want from
[28:11] their project and what they want to get
[28:13] out of it and we'll see if that
[28:14] translates well with how we can help
[28:16] them so it's a very intentional way of
[28:18] going about it but I think that's the uh
[28:21] I think that's the right way um in in
[28:23] doing something like this which is you
[28:26] know um you know requires it a ton of
[28:28] work behind the scenes to to pull off
[28:30] and uh it's something that I think is
[28:33] definitely well needed into the space
[28:35] because it it every year it kind of
[28:38] revitalizes these Builders uh from all
[28:40] over the world and it gets them you know
[28:43] gets them to present to the the rest of
[28:45] the ecosystem and then they have that
[28:47] whole year like last year was really
[28:48] interesting we we brought six teams and
[28:50] they out pitched to these investors and
[28:53] all those six teams that were a part of
[28:55] top Builder the finalists um you know
[28:57] all got some sort of funding at at at at
[29:01] at at some point in the in the year um
[29:04] they probably didn't get the same sort
[29:05] of like attention and the money like yo
[29:08] paky did who could who won the event but
[29:10] just like Top Chef like you know the
[29:12] second third fourth fifth place people
[29:14] still got more than enough attention to
[29:17] to attract uh you know more users more a
[29:20] you know more investors more people that
[29:22] wanted to to help them fulfill that
[29:24] project or or or company there's an
[29:27] amazing show oh it's it's also an
[29:29] American right the Shark Tank I think
[29:32] it's the it's the American show we we
[29:34] have uh two minutes two millions it's
[29:37] called in Austria uh there's like
[29:40] probably like in every country something
[29:41] like that uh and I always love that show
[29:45] I like when there's like new ideas
[29:48] bitched and there's even uh recently
[29:51] when I flow back from uh Salvador there
[29:56] was something in in the plane watched it
[29:58] was money cord absolutely loved it I
[30:01] mean I don't like Kevin o that much uh
[30:04] but but the money C was really nice to
[30:07] to watch I just like to have like the
[30:09] businesses present something and for
[30:12] like Shark Tank it's like for for
[30:13] investing for money Court there like a
[30:15] dispute and then the Court decides on
[30:17] who wins uh it's it's really fun to see
[30:20] so so I think 100% you should do a TV
[30:24] show or like just like an YouTube show
[30:25] or whatever I think it would be super
[30:28] fun to watch and it would also uh give
[30:32] the companies there even greater
[30:34] attention because I've seen with
[30:37] companies that present at two minutes
[30:40] and two millions in Austria even though
[30:43] sometimes they don't get
[30:45] money from that show they get so much
[30:47] advertisement to they can uh advertise
[30:51] basically their product with the pitch
[30:54] and they actually usually always do
[30:56] better after that
[30:58] it's rarely the case that they do worse
[31:00] after that because they get the
[31:02] attention stuff like that it has to be a
[31:03] bad company to not benefit from
[31:07] attention uh so I I would definitely
[31:10] love to see a show there and and put
[31:13] something together even like it doesn't
[31:14] have to be completely professional in
[31:16] the beginning I would love to see that
[31:19] yeah so I think it's funny you bring
[31:20] that up because we've had this idea for
[31:23] like two years at this point where we
[31:25] want to do that um but it's uh
[31:28] yeah it would it would be I think I
[31:30] think the really cool thing about what I
[31:32] do at plab is um is just being around
[31:36] the other people that are building these
[31:37] companies and seeing them go through um
[31:41] iterations of their product and just
[31:43] being a just being just being a viewer
[31:45] of it all and I when I look at like um
[31:49] these IND individuals that come through
[31:51] here you can kind of see their
[31:52] progression and see where they started
[31:54] and where they are and it to me it's
[31:55] always really inspiring I just find it
[31:57] so inspiring to see somebody who comes
[31:59] in not really knowing much of anything
[32:01] and then by the time they leave Club lab
[32:04] they're you they're a complete boss you
[32:05] know when it comes to running their
[32:07] company and it's always uh extremely
[32:09] satisfying to me to to kind of see that
[32:11] journey and be a part of it in some
[32:13] capacity but uh yeah that that I think
[32:17] to show that to um to show that to the
[32:20] rest of the world I think they would be
[32:22] really really really really fascinated
[32:24] by the Bitcoin ecosystem because um
[32:26] there's some stuff that happens behind
[32:28] the scenes that uh is completely I mean
[32:31] ridiculously different uh than the the
[32:34] Fiat Tech space uh building a startup
[32:38] and um I I I think if I think if people
[32:41] saw the amount of work and legal and App
[32:46] Store approval and some sort you know
[32:48] all these types of things that most
[32:49] people don't realize like um they would
[32:52] be kind of shocked by the amount of just
[32:56] pain and and uh
[32:58] work that these uh Bitcoin Founders have
[33:00] to go through just to get a product
[33:02] released into the world there's a
[33:04] there's a ton of hurdles that look like
[33:06] it's like everybody wants to stop you
[33:08] from making a Bitcoin uh app you know
[33:11] and um and that's not even including
[33:13] your competition so it's uh it's pretty
[33:17] fascinating as far as the documentary
[33:18] you brought up documentaries we actually
[33:21] in
[33:21] 21 when ple laab was just starting we
[33:24] actually had a a filmmaker follow PL
[33:27] laab and he actually a movie around
[33:29] around us uh around the Austin Community
[33:32] at the time it's called the bitcoiners
[33:33] movie and uh um so a lot of a lot of
[33:36] what you're talking about like seeing
[33:38] behind the scenes you would you kind of
[33:39] see that already inside that movie um
[33:42] but uh but yeah I partnered up with coin
[33:46] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[33:49] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[33:51] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[33:54] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[33:57] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[34:00] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[34:03] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[34:05] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[34:09] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:12] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:15] watch collections you have the date of
[34:17] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[34:21] there and of course also the block
[34:23] height and which EPO we are currently in
[34:26] I love the level of detail they put in
[34:29] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:32] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:34] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[34:37] love those watches so so much if you
[34:40] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[34:42] regular basis I'll guess you already
[34:45] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[34:47] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[34:50] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[34:53] personal recommendation for Hardware
[34:54] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[34:57] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[35:00] gift for a friend who has still their
[35:02] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[35:05] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[35:08] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[35:12] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[35:15] to really level up your sovereignty as
[35:17] an individual you have to have the most
[35:20] secure self custody setup you have to
[35:23] secure your own devices you have to
[35:26] protect your privacy you have to set up
[35:28] an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:31] where you live you even want to have a
[35:33] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:36] in case something goes really really
[35:38] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:40] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:43] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:45] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[35:49] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[35:52] how you can level up your sovereignty
[35:55] there could be could be some even
[35:58] even in my brain was just American Idol
[36:01] as as you Americans Idol as you as you
[36:03] said because you like have those eight
[36:05] weeks and you can really see how they
[36:08] come in and how they then get to the big
[36:10] stage and like the the fewer can
[36:13] actually uh build like almost an
[36:16] internment relationship and uh rooting
[36:18] for people and then they fall out of the
[36:20] r and stuff like that so I think it has
[36:23] a lot of potential but obviously if you
[36:24] do something like that uh you you need a
[36:27] team of people who really get behind to
[36:30] the storytelling and editing like that's
[36:33] a whole operation that's it's a whole
[36:34] new company maybe someone should pitch
[36:37] that company this year's blab and do
[36:40] next year oh that'd be great oh that'd
[36:42] be great we I think like seeing the that
[36:44] transformation like when uh like we we
[36:46] were talking about Francisco earlier I I
[36:48] met him in 21 I actually met that guy in
[36:51] 2021 and he was just a pleb that was
[36:53] snacking s and had this idea for a
[36:56] company called yopan and he had a lot of
[36:59] of what you see now in the app but um uh
[37:03] but when he came into PL lab in 22 it
[37:05] was it was like just let's get to work
[37:07] and and so he's been he's been grinding
[37:09] for a really long time to make y paky
[37:11] happen but you know it's it's no wonder
[37:14] it's like gotten to where it's at
[37:15] because I think when you meet Francisco
[37:17] and you you meet the type of person he
[37:19] is you really realize that this guy's
[37:20] special like there's something really
[37:22] special about them and I I think
[37:23] everybody individually at PL lab has
[37:25] that extra thing that you need
[37:28] um to to really make a go out of it I
[37:30] think uh I think a lot of our Founders
[37:32] inside of PL lab have that extra that
[37:34] extra twinkle in their eye that you need
[37:36] to have as a Founder to get through the
[37:38] hard times and and and the easy times
[37:41] so absolutely yeah and yeah Francisco
[37:44] that that's the name I forgot forgot
[37:47] before thank you so
[37:49] much um yeah perfect then uh one one
[37:52] more thing on that topic I have uh
[37:55] because it is as you said hard to build
[37:58] a Bitcoin business and build a Bitcoin
[38:00] startup for me there's like two main
[38:02] reasons maybe you have other reasons
[38:04] also the the the reason is like Bitcoin
[38:07] business usually tries to uh get to
[38:10] bitcoiners and bitcoiners really don't
[38:12] want to part with the
[38:14] Bitcoin uh it's like on the consumer
[38:17] side and then on the even on the
[38:18] investor side if you're a Bitcoin that
[38:22] wants to invest um you have a really
[38:25] high hurdle rate like just keeping your
[38:27] money in Bitcoin is quite profitable
[38:31] like it's it generates a lot of
[38:34] additional purchasing power for you so
[38:37] to invest in a startup that has a highly
[38:41] a high like likelihood to fail because
[38:44] Bitcoin has a very very very very very
[38:46] low likelihood to fail uh you really
[38:49] have to pitch a a quality idea and it's
[38:53] different maybe do the do the altcoin
[38:56] shitcoin uh uh space where it's just
[38:59] like thrown around with with money and
[39:00] also feat space where uh yeah if you if
[39:04] you save in feat you have really
[39:06] incentivized to get like all to sponsor
[39:09] all the the startups so maybe it's
[39:12] interesting to see like uh what did you
[39:15] notice in that space because of that new
[39:17] hurdle rate because bitcoiners don't
[39:19] want to part with the Bitcoin and maybe
[39:21] also an an Insight of what if all the
[39:25] people get Bitcoin and have bitco coin
[39:27] in this world how different will be the
[39:29] financial space and the Venture Capital
[39:31] space
[39:32] then yeah I think I think I I think I
[39:37] think there's something that most people
[39:39] don't really take into account when it
[39:42] comes to investing in Bitcoin startups
[39:43] and I think I think there's people like
[39:46] Michael sailor and um people like that
[39:50] and um and I definitely see it I think I
[39:53] I've seen it for a while now and I've
[39:55] written about this I have a Blog called
[39:57] Thriller Bitcoin um if if you want to
[40:00] pull it up or if you want to um you have
[40:03] to sign up but it's um I've talked about
[40:05] this and I've actually written about it
[40:06] and and I've it's I I think it's I call
[40:09] it Shadow play but I actually think it's
[40:11] more of a zero sum game I think I think
[40:14] when you look at it from like a a
[40:17] Bitcoin um investment lens there's only
[40:20] 21 million Bitcoin in the world I think
[40:24] if you're playing that game there
[40:26] there's only only so
[40:28] many um there's only so many Bitcoin out
[40:33] there and if you look at where it's
[40:35] allocated right now I think the majority
[40:38] of it is you know there's some in mining
[40:41] companies and there's some in general
[40:43] startups and I think a lot of a lot of
[40:46] the startups especially in in the
[40:47] Bitcoin ecosystem have a have a have a
[40:50] have a Bitcoin uh sitting on their
[40:54] balance sheet and that especially when
[40:56] you find a company like
[40:57] right or a company like Yaky that's
[41:00] going to be having some sort of SATs
[41:02] flow um the more and more that SATs flow
[41:05] is the spigot of it is is turned up and
[41:08] the more and more that's flowing into
[41:09] the company the more and more that
[41:10] Bitcoin is Silling on that balance sheet
[41:13] and so at some point um I think the
[41:17] majority of this Bitcoin that we know as
[41:20] bitcoiners is going to be sitting on
[41:21] some sort of company balance sheet
[41:23] because if we if we all believe in
[41:25] hyperbitcoinization and we all believe
[41:26] that there some sort of um way that we
[41:29] get there and I believe it's through
[41:31] Bitcoin companies and more Bitcoin
[41:33] businesses well then you kind of have to
[41:35] believe that that those dollars or not
[41:37] dollars that Bitcoin is gonna be sitting
[41:39] on there it's no it's it's no it's no
[41:42] it's no different than Apple sitting on
[41:44] one point I think it's like 4.5 billion
[41:47] dollars uh just sitting on your treasury
[41:50] it's the same thing that'll be locked up
[41:51] with Bitcoin companies uh we're a long
[41:53] ways away to getting there but I think
[41:55] when you see companies like jippy and py
[41:57] the ones that are coming out and they're
[41:59] trying to raise I think you'd kind of
[42:00] have to be a not to want to invest
[42:02] in something like that because these are
[42:04] some of the companies that um that are
[42:06] going to potentially change the world
[42:08] and that's that's always been my pitch
[42:11] it's like why what why wouldn't you
[42:14] invest in strike um the I wouldn't like
[42:16] personally like I wouldn't even invest
[42:19] in anything outside of Bitcoin companies
[42:22] because I know a Bitcoin company's
[42:23] holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet
[42:24] so I wouldn't invest in anything else I
[42:26] would invest in Bitcoin and like Bitcoin
[42:28] companies and like that's it I wouldn't
[42:29] invest in like Tesla Microsoft like I
[42:33] personally
[42:34] believe um at some point you know Apple
[42:37] would Apple will probably just get
[42:38] bought out by micro strategy if they
[42:40] don't get on a Bitcoin standard I mean
[42:41] those dollars are just going to dilute
[42:43] like a like a melting Ice Cube like he
[42:45] he talks about and so I think I'm
[42:48] incredibly bearish on Apple incredibly
[42:50] bearish on some of these other uh tech
[42:52] companies because they don't have
[42:53] Bitcoin on the balance sheet I mean that
[42:55] could change overnight but right now I I
[42:58] I don't
[42:59] see yeah that that's always been my
[43:01] pitch when people are like oh you know
[43:03] why would I invest in a Bitcoin startup
[43:05] and like why wouldn't you invest in a
[43:06] Bitcoin startup why would you invest in
[43:09] anything else that doesn't have Bitcoin
[43:10] on its balance sheet and that's kind of
[43:11] what the humongous risk is and to be
[43:14] honest the other thing I would say is
[43:15] just like uh the the founders in in
[43:19] Bitcoin are just are are kind of these
[43:21] like you know these next level autist as
[43:24] as far as the way they think through
[43:26] things they play like 40 chess and so
[43:29] that's another reason i' I've we used to
[43:32] when we started when plab started we
[43:33] were working at a Capital Factory which
[43:34] is a tech um kind of co-working space
[43:37] and a lot of people were doing kind of
[43:39] tech startups and those type of Founders
[43:41] that I would run into over there were
[43:43] nearly we're not nearly the same caliber
[43:45] type of Founders that you find in the
[43:46] Bitcoin space it's like principles
[43:50] morals like everything and so what
[43:52] you're getting with a Bitcoin company is
[43:54] not only some like really great
[43:55] individual founders with high morals
[43:58] High principles but you're also getting
[43:59] a Bitcoin company that has Bitcoin out
[44:01] balance sheet and if you're lucky some a
[44:04] company that can generate SS flow that
[44:06] will drive up that revenue and that
[44:08] purchasing price so that's kind of
[44:11] that's my P for
[44:12] it it's kind of probably what what you
[44:15] see with micro strategy now even though
[44:18] they don't have a Bitcoin business uh
[44:21] they they do to generate Revenue um a
[44:24] software business a traditional one
[44:26] that's been there since a since a long
[44:28] while but the the idea is the same right
[44:32] you have Bitcoin as a treasury uh and
[44:34] then you even get like kind of a an an
[44:38] leveraged Bitcoin play where you have
[44:40] Bitcoin but also revenue on top of that
[44:44] where you can buy more Bitcoin with that
[44:47] is is that what you're kind of seeing
[44:48] yeah yes can you can you explain that
[44:50] last part real quick oh yeah uh I I was
[44:54] I was just saying like if if you have
[44:56] basically
[44:57] uh a Bitcoin company you get you you buy
[45:01] Bitcoin with that because they have
[45:03] Bitcoin Treasury and then on top of the
[45:06] Bitcoin treasury uh you get an Revenue
[45:10] which they are buying Bitcoin with so
[45:13] when you only buy Bitcoin you just buy
[45:15] Bitcoin and wait uh when you get buy a
[45:18] Bitcoin company you buy Bitcoin plus a
[45:21] working company that in the best case
[45:24] gets profits in and reinvest in in into
[45:28] the Bitcoin treasury so it it should in
[45:31] theory grow faster uh than Bitcoin
[45:34] itself if they have Bitcoin as a
[45:36] treasury plus uh profits that flow into
[45:40] the treasury yeah and I think does make
[45:43] sense yeah you're kind of leading to the
[45:45] same thing that I that I've written
[45:46] about I think the biggest problem is you
[45:48] have these traditional currencies you
[45:50] know which governments can like you know
[45:52] issue without any limits and I think the
[45:54] the interesting Dynamic among um
[45:57] bitcoiners is that uh we have this thing
[46:00] called ngu technology so number go up so
[46:04] the value of Bitcoin is not static it's
[46:05] it can it can rise there's all sorts of
[46:07] complexity but I think with the Bitcoin
[46:08] ETFs it definitely gives it some kind of
[46:11] Baseline right and I and I think when
[46:13] you put that finite quantity and that
[46:16] fluctuating value there's a fruitful
[46:18] kind of bounty that comes into play here
[46:21] uh especially when it comes to enriching
[46:23] the entire ecosystem of Bitcoin and so
[46:25] when you look at this kind of zero sum
[46:27] nature of like uh of uh of transactional
[46:30] exchanges into like a a layered
[46:32] interaction and and and I think it
[46:35] evolves into something that is far more
[46:38] significant um and and kind of like
[46:41] beneath the surface that probably isn't
[46:43] apparent right now but the more and more
[46:46] you kind of watch this closely at least
[46:47] from my at least from my vantage point
[46:50] um there's a deeper game of strategy uh
[46:53] that's being played right now and I
[46:54] don't think people are actually talking
[46:55] about it and I think in this kind of
[46:57] post a Bitcoin ETF World um you know
[47:00] you're going to have gold you know
[47:02] become that the next Haven probably
[47:05] after Bitcoin right um and yeah I I just
[47:09] I just think the paradigms are kind of
[47:10] changing and I think you know P prior to
[47:14] the ETF and prior to micro strategy you
[47:16] would have like an entire like um deep
[47:20] understanding of of of of of you know of
[47:23] where dollars are going and and bonds
[47:26] and stuff like that but I think it um I
[47:29] think you kind of I think as as far as
[47:30] bitcoiners and what we do as Founders I
[47:32] think you kind of have to embrace the
[47:33] change head on and you kind of have to
[47:35] be willing to play to this this this
[47:38] world that is not quite there yet and
[47:40] you know and and I don't think that's I
[47:42] don't think that's dangerous or crazy
[47:44] either I think there was a time when
[47:46] Bitcoin was a definitely a fringe a
[47:48] fringe like digital asset but I think
[47:50] the more and more we see it find itself
[47:51] on corporate balance sheets I think
[47:53] companies will have a fru sh
[47:54] responsibility to to add that to as at
[47:57] to their already existing business to
[47:59] not only drive growth but to drive
[48:01] revenue and to drive opportunity
[48:03] opportunity because just the the cost
[48:05] and the negative effect that could come
[48:07] from that Equity value by not having
[48:09] Bitcoin on their balance sheet can lead
[48:11] can lead to um probably uh all sorts of
[48:14] bad happenings but I I definitely
[48:16] see Bitcoin uh uh startups as like a
[48:20] cheat codat to um to kind of getting
[48:22] there faster but U that's kind of how I
[48:25] see it on my side but
[48:27] but if anybody's interested definitely
[48:29] go check out Thriller Bitcoin I've
[48:30] written about it it's called shadowplay
[48:32] the article um and you can you have to
[48:34] sign up but and I'm definitely going to
[48:37] write more more because I've thought
[48:38] about it more deeply since then and I do
[48:40] think
[48:41] there's I don't think this is I don't
[48:43] think this has been been talked about
[48:45] very often in the Bitcoin space uh at
[48:47] least um in Prior Cycles but I think
[48:49] people are starting to understand it I
[48:51] definitely know sailor definitely
[48:53] understands
[48:54] it he he very well I love I love it a
[48:59] lot actually um and it's it's kind of
[49:02] also why I decided back then to go from
[49:07] uh some stocks and some Bitcoin to only
[49:10] Bitcoin um because I came to the
[49:14] conclusion that I don't want to be
[49:16] involved in companies that don't get
[49:19] that they have to have a Bitcoin
[49:21] Treasury and I came to that conclusion
[49:23] in like 20 end of 2020 beginning of 2021
[49:28] where I just like kept uh where I just
[49:30] like pushed everything to the side
[49:32] except Tesla and Bitcoin uh but then uh
[49:36] I also pushed Tesla away in 2021 because
[49:39] I it was clear to me that the understand
[49:43] it better than the other big S&P 500
[49:45] companies but they still don't get it
[49:48] they still have a long way to go and I
[49:50] think to this stay they are holding
[49:51] Bitcoin to their credit so like they
[49:53] still hold uh more Bitcoin than probably
[49:57] 99% of all bitcoiners uh but they could
[50:02] do so much more and El is that one
[50:05] founder that can do those crazy things
[50:08] and apple has a way harder way to go
[50:10] there Microsoft has a way harder way to
[50:12] go there uh but he will also come
[50:15] eventually to that conclusion maybe did
[50:18] you heard with micro strategy uh that
[50:20] Michael saor actually has a three minute
[50:23] presentation for Microsoft uh that they
[50:25] hold because of that uh shareholder
[50:28] proposal and now uh Microsoft has to
[50:32] listen to three minutes of Michael
[50:34] sailor yeah that's amazing I I uh yeah
[50:37] I've I've heard I've heard so many
[50:38] stories about sailor but there's this
[50:40] one where he's on a call with somebody
[50:43] and the person doesn't uh is like you
[50:46] know buying shitcoins and stuff like
[50:47] that and The Story Goes where a sailor
[50:50] uh tells this person to buy Bitcoin and
[50:54] he hangs up the phone and then the guy
[50:57] comes from the other room and he talks
[50:58] to the rest of the people in the room
[50:59] and he goes can you believe this guy he
[51:01] just told me to drop everything and buy
[51:03] Bitcoin and the people in the room
[51:05] didn't have the heart to tell the guy
[51:07] who was in charge that yeah he's right
[51:10] but I've heard similar stories where he
[51:11] kind of does that but um yeah it's it's
[51:14] incredible I think um kind of um the
[51:18] just the way Bitcoin has changed uh here
[51:21] in the past three years and I think the
[51:23] the the a lot of the ETF and some of
[51:25] that other thing is just already uh it's
[51:28] just caused it to severely just like
[51:30] really catapult things I'm sure you see
[51:32] a lot of it Robin you talked to a lot of
[51:34] people so you probably see it most
[51:36] probably more more so than anybody
[51:38] because you're getting a a much bigger
[51:40] picture of everything around the world
[51:42] so yeah if I actually hold it up 10
[51:45] years I will be probably a really good
[51:48] informed Bitcoin in 10 years about
[51:50] Bitcoin I talking every day I do a
[51:52] different bitcoiner uh but it's it's
[51:54] interesting for me um this traditional
[51:58] Financial space coming into Bitcoin I
[52:01] mean even micro strategy is coming from
[52:04] a very traditional business model that
[52:07] has nothing new with Bitcoin but they
[52:09] are coming aggressively into Bitcoin
[52:11] then we have the obviously the Bitcoin
[52:12] ETF coming into Bitcoin uh and actually
[52:17] on bitcoin conference I sometimes hear
[52:20] that notion of like we we don't want
[52:23] that we we we want to have like the pure
[52:25] mission of Bitcoin that Bitcoin Maxi
[52:28] Vision that uh a Sor calls it a crypto
[52:31] Anarchist vision of it um I I personally
[52:34] think Bitcoin is for everyone and and
[52:37] like we we we want also Bitcoin for our
[52:41] enemies like Bitcoin is also for the
[52:44] people we disagree with um but how do
[52:46] you like or how how do you see the
[52:48] traditional Financial space with black
[52:50] rock uh with the Bitcoin ETFs now
[52:53] entering into Bitcoin and maybe
[52:55] potentially uh trying to to screw with
[52:58] it yeah I've talked a lot about this um
[53:01] but I think um I think personally I
[53:04] think it's I can't help but and I've
[53:07] talked about this in another podcast but
[53:09] I can't help but want to know if they
[53:11] really understand Bitcoin reason being I
[53:14] don't think they realize what they're
[53:15] doing to themselves like if you like if
[53:18] you roll the tape Robin and you're kind
[53:20] of playing this out like do they know
[53:22] they're like obsoleting their own like
[53:25] you know uh
[53:28] I don't want to say it but like do you
[53:29] know what I'm trying to say like I I
[53:31] think I think they are maybe even
[53:34] embarrassed like there there's a guy who
[53:37] who just sits on the beach in a Salvador
[53:40] that is outperforming each and every
[53:43] investor that is sitting in Black Rock
[53:45] and uh talking to all the clients at
[53:48] some point the clients is
[53:49] like don't you have a Bitcoin strategy
[53:52] so I think they're kind of forced into
[53:54] it uh I don't know what the extent in or
[53:57] like I have no clue yeah I mean I don't
[54:00] know either um you know that's not my
[54:02] that's not my Lane but I'm just always
[54:05] wonder if like they see this playing out
[54:07] the same way a lot of us bitcoiners do
[54:09] but as far as do I see them going into U
[54:13] making a muck of things I don't I don't
[54:15] see any sign of it yet but I you know I
[54:17] wouldn't put it past a behemoth like
[54:19] that but uh I mean you know like you
[54:21] said earlier Bitcoin is for enemies so
[54:23] it's um it's for everybody absolutely
[54:26] the one thing that I'm fairly certain
[54:29] about that they have a lot of employees
[54:32] only focused on uh only focused on
[54:37] researching and making presentations
[54:39] around Bitcoin really like diving deep
[54:42] into the community uh and I'm all almost
[54:46] fairly certain there's like a few
[54:47] employees that just like uh listen to
[54:49] all the podcast listen to the community
[54:51] listen to what's going on on Twitter and
[54:53] extracting all the information uh
[54:55] because have just so much resources it
[54:58] would be so easy for them to do and I
[55:01] see some of the presentations they do
[55:05] and they're really good like they really
[55:07] resonate also with Bitcoin so uh they
[55:10] they kind of have
[55:11] to like it the presentations they
[55:14] sometimes do this it doesn't seem like
[55:16] they are just like an ignorant Financial
[55:19] advis did them it's it's like someone
[55:21] that actually looked into the Bitcoin
[55:24] Community a little bit more than just
[55:25] the surface is uh and uh I don't know
[55:29] who told me that like even before the
[55:31] Bitcoin um Bitcoin EDF came uh he said
[55:36] like oh like black years full on in they
[55:39] have like blocks of people uh that just
[55:41] research that and back then I did not
[55:45] believe him that much but now what I see
[55:47] is like like maybe they actually like
[55:49] have a lot of people that just research
[55:52] Bitcoin and report to someone higher and
[55:54] and they kind of make a strategy out of
[55:56] it because what what what the
[55:58] presentations say it's it's not that bad
[56:00] with like there's no second best it's a
[56:02] unique diversifier uh and the messages
[56:05] inside of the slides also the it's it's
[56:08] they also like the I don't know if You'
[56:10] seen it they made like a slide comparing
[56:13] Bitcoin uh and ethereum and they just
[56:17] nailed it we like yeah like Bitcoin is
[56:19] the Comm Bitcoin is a secure thing and
[56:22] stuff like that even though they made
[56:23] the ethereum um uh um ethereum ETF I
[56:27] think major mistake but uh does Bitcoin
[56:31] doesn't care about that also um so I I
[56:34] think they have researchers and a lot of
[56:36] them on bitcoin that's fascinating I
[56:39] never heard that before but that makes a
[56:41] lot of sense they're gonna have to
[56:42] download five of your podcasts a week to
[56:44] catch up with all yours so they have a
[56:47] lot of
[56:48] work maybe AI is helping them and just
[56:51] like putting the transcripts in and
[56:53] like getting out out of the at least
[56:56] it's I I do it like that I don't know if
[56:59] I ever said another podcast but but
[57:01] before I interview someone uh I cannot
[57:04] like listen to like five podcasts a day
[57:06] before I interview someone I download
[57:10] from YouTube all the transcripts where I
[57:12] guest was previously on and then I asked
[57:15] chbt what were the topics they talked
[57:17] about what are the most controversial
[57:19] opinions that the guest had uh what are
[57:22] questions that the guest should have
[57:25] been asked but has never been asked
[57:27] before so like just like trying to get a
[57:29] picture of that and then never ask the
[57:31] questions what uh gbd gives me but um it
[57:37] gives me a really nice idea of who the
[57:40] guest is and what he's talking about and
[57:42] it gives me like direction for uh the
[57:45] the conversation where I wanted to to
[57:47] bring it to and usually what ends up
[57:50] happening I write down 10 topics and
[57:52] after the third the conversation is just
[57:54] like free flowing and it's going any
[57:56] anywhere and and I completely forget my
[57:59] my notes but it it this this allows me
[58:03] to get a sense of the guest within like
[58:06] 10 minutes that's amazing I I would be
[58:08] curious to ask you like do you see your
[58:11] your I guess because you have a media
[58:12] company right with your podcast do you
[58:14] see yourself as somebody who is
[58:17] strategically thinking about putting
[58:18] Bitcoin on on your own balance sheet for
[58:20] for the future of of of your
[58:24] podcast 100% uh I mean I have right now
[58:28] A self-employed company there's
[58:29] something like that in in Austria it's
[58:32] really simple to to set up um it's just
[58:36] like you fill out like two forms it's
[58:38] really uh without bureaucracy a lot uh
[58:42] and you are income based taxes
[58:45] especially if you have like income uh
[58:48] with less than 50k a year it's really
[58:51] nice thing to do and yeah in the first
[58:54] year uh it's it's like you can you can
[58:57] write off the expenses of the the year
[59:00] prior to to starting up everything that
[59:02] you have to that business so like it's
[59:04] it's it's hard to get over that income
[59:06] even with 50k uh so everything I earn
[59:11] goes directly into private property uh
[59:14] and most of my income is already in
[59:17] Bitcoin from all my sponsors except one
[59:20] uh is paying me in Bitcoin and all of
[59:22] them um offering me to pay in Bitcoin I
[59:25] just like have this one to to pay my
[59:27] feat bills so I I opt in to to get the
[59:30] feat things uh so it's it's it's really
[59:33] fun um to have directly Bitcoin and I
[59:38] keep a zero feared
[59:40] balance uh and that's I do it like that
[59:44] I have a credit line of 10K uh and
[59:47] sometimes I go a little bit in minus
[59:48] sometimes I go a little bit in plus but
[59:50] I always try to level it up with zero
[59:52] fear that that's my goal I always want
[59:55] to have just like zero feeld and 100%
[59:57] Bitcoin and that's how I operate but I'm
[59:59] also a company that just has myself like
[60:03] I just have to feed myself so I don't
[60:05] have employees and stuff like that if I
[60:06] have employees and I'm responsible for
[60:09] their families and their salaries and
[60:11] stuff like that I might have a
[60:14] bigger a bigger reserve for short-term
[60:17] expenses in in Fiat uh maybe I'm like
[60:20] 95% or I don't know maybe I have a
[60:23] bigger credit line or whatever I did not
[60:25] think about that till now uh but uh I
[60:29] operate on a full Bitcoin standard get
[60:31] most of the money paid in Bitcoin uh and
[60:35] have 100% of my treasury in Bitcoin and
[60:37] yeah maybe at some point I pay people in
[60:40] Bitcoin uh when when I get in my first
[60:43] employee d That's amazing that's so
[60:45] inspiring I think uh I think you're
[60:48] you're you and there's you know there's
[60:49] several others in the space that I've
[60:51] talked to that that are doing similar
[60:53] things with their podcast it's it's
[60:54] fascinating man it's fascinating yeah
[60:57] it's it's it's it's crazy and yeah I
[61:00] love it a lot because I started this in
[61:03] February uh with almost no income uh and
[61:08] we had like my feat salary and then it
[61:09] went down like to almost zero and now
[61:12] I'm actually above my feeld level uh on
[61:15] a complete basis if you look at hourly
[61:18] basis I'm still under that because I
[61:20] work way more hours than before uh but I
[61:23] also don't consider it work anymore so
[61:25] that that's different too uh but yeah
[61:27] it's it's been an inspiring Journey for
[61:30] me uh to to just have this podcast and
[61:33] and and and be involved in the Bitcoin
[61:34] Community all those bitcoiners I talk to
[61:36] are inspiring me so much and and uh just
[61:39] make me uh some someone came up to me in
[61:42] the elav to a conference and asked me
[61:44] hey Robin are you burning out
[61:46] like I I have more energy than ever like
[61:49] it's not even close to that like I I
[61:51] came further away from that with
[61:53] quitting my fat shop and working instead
[61:56] of I I worked previous like 30 hours per
[61:59] week uh and now I work like I don't 60
[62:01] or 65 I don't know I never counted them
[62:04] but probably some somewhere around that
[62:06] range and it's amazing Bitcoin it's an
[62:09] obsession that I have that's amazing
[62:11] that's great to hear I mean I I feel
[62:13] similarly with the things that I do it
[62:15] it doesn't necessarily feel like work I
[62:17] think the only time I really need to
[62:18] take time off is to do all the normal
[62:20] things in life you know like wash
[62:21] clothes and clean the house stuff like
[62:23] that but yeah which gives me uh maybe
[62:27] one one question here before we end um
[62:31] what should bitcoiners be focusing on
[62:33] because we we we have this Obsession
[62:36] that we really want to be in Bitcoin and
[62:38] that we really want to contribute but
[62:39] everyone has just like a very limited uh
[62:42] time what do you think with with seeing
[62:45] so many startups we seeing so many
[62:46] entrepreneurs what is the like the one
[62:49] thing uh Bitcoin should be focusing on
[62:51] when the aim and the goal is driving
[62:55] Bitcoin at adoption uh forward yeah I
[62:58] think we live in we live in a one like
[63:02] this is a era like this is going to be
[63:03] like once in a millennia type of
[63:05] technology I think we're living at a
[63:07] time right now where you literally have
[63:10] the option to getting the hardest money
[63:13] ever created on Earth uh and and you
[63:16] could potentially do that one of two
[63:17] ways at least the way I see you can
[63:19] either you know mine your Fiat job and
[63:21] you know keep snacking and you know do
[63:23] it humbly or you could you know
[63:26] really get in the game and like start
[63:28] building up start start building up a
[63:29] Bitcoin company right like you're doing
[63:31] your media company and and you you you
[63:34] went ahead and put full effort into it
[63:35] and now you're thriving uh I think I
[63:38] think as well most bitcoiners should
[63:40] really look at themselves and say hey
[63:42] like I probably only have the next 10 15
[63:44] years at most to really make a go at it
[63:47] and and try to get as much Bitcoin as I
[63:49] can either individually or as a company
[63:52] and then why not both right that would
[63:54] be my thing is like trying to get people
[63:56] to really believe in themselves to going
[63:59] after this once in a-lifetime uh
[64:01] technology and actually trying to you
[64:03] know make a difference for not only
[64:04] yourself and your current family and and
[64:07] and and and and you know friends but
[64:10] like for future Generations because your
[64:11] kids depend on it
[64:13] right absolutely is is that it's a
[64:17] difficult question for me also to answer
[64:19] but should we be also more involved in
[64:23] politics it it it seems like this
[64:25] because this year politics has been such
[64:26] a huge Topic in Bitcoin is is is that um
[64:30] a a a good spend uh time as a bitcoiner
[64:35] to be trying to infiltrate the political
[64:38] system I don't I don't know I think I
[64:40] think I've said this before I think most
[64:41] I think most everybody has a job in
[64:43] Bitcoin you know whatever that job is
[64:45] you know mine is to help startups and
[64:47] entrepreneurs get to success I think you
[64:49] know yours is to interview some of the
[64:51] best people in the space and you know
[64:53] you know share your opinions and and all
[64:55] that kind of stuff I think I think there
[64:57] are some bitcoiners in the space that
[64:58] you know they do feel like their job is
[64:59] to get uh some sort of uh politician or
[65:03] some sort of group into uh into our
[65:06] ecosystem and be a driving force of
[65:08] change for it um I yeah I would say that
[65:11] would be my answer but um you know I'm
[65:14] I'm somebody that's not on Twitter you
[65:15] know I have just a Noster account and
[65:17] like a podcast and a Blog right I think
[65:20] um that's enough for me to to get out my
[65:22] opinions and that's enough for me to to
[65:24] kind of uh you know do that kind of
[65:27] thing and uh and the rest of the the
[65:29] rest of the the stuff that I really love
[65:30] doing is the real world interactions
[65:32] like I love going to meetups I love
[65:34] talking to new people like I love going
[65:35] to conferences and stuff like that like
[65:37] that's where I get the bulk of my value
[65:39] from but I would say if your value is
[65:42] derived from you know doing stuff with
[65:43] politicians and that might be something
[65:44] that you should pursue if that's what
[65:46] you're interested in I think it's a
[65:48] great Point uh and this is where like
[65:51] tennis
[65:52] Porter is is perfect in in where he is
[65:55] right now with like the the political
[65:57] force and and and I would be really bad
[65:59] in it even though I was in politics
[66:01] before I I but I I don't like it I
[66:04] cannot be as Frank as I am usually I met
[66:07] him one time and it was very brief and
[66:10] all he talked about was the politics
[66:12] stuff so I think it's one of those
[66:14] things where he's probably just really
[66:15] interested in in uh in that so that's
[66:18] probably you know he should keep
[66:19] pursuing it if that's what he loves
[66:21] doing you know but absolutely he's
[66:23] somebody that I think he was early on
[66:25] all that kind of strategic Reserve stuff
[66:27] I think I want to say he was was talking
[66:29] about that well before anybody that I
[66:31] remember yeah and he's pushing really
[66:33] nicely on it uh he was I think like also
[66:37] everyone that wants to get to know him
[66:39] better or uh already knows him and wants
[66:41] to listen podcast I also have with
[66:43] Dennis Porto
[66:44] one
[66:46] I so funny because I did that in the
[66:49] beginning more and more and now it seems
[66:52] like when when someone comes up in the
[66:55] podcast
[66:56] I want to get that tip because I have it
[66:58] in the library and maybe I just put a a
[67:02] permanent disclaimer on on there like
[67:05] each person that is mentioned in this
[67:06] podcast probably already was on the
[67:08] podcast so go back in the library and
[67:10] find him it's interesting you bring that
[67:12] up uh just real quick uh the Texas
[67:15] blockchain conferences this week so this
[67:17] is like a um this is like a a group of
[67:21] of of people that come together to
[67:23] influence Texas politics with with
[67:25] Bitcoin and stuff like that so that's
[67:27] going on this week in Dallas and uh um
[67:31] uh yeah it's kind of Fallen falls into
[67:33] what you were talking about with the all
[67:35] the politicians uh getting involved and
[67:38] and you know that's a conference that I
[67:39] don't attend to I I have been to it
[67:41] before here when it was in Austin um and
[67:44] it was just really boring to me it was
[67:46] just like politics and Bitcoin and it
[67:49] was just I found it incredibly boring uh
[67:51] but um you know I think I think people
[67:54] have to find their Niche and then just
[67:56] kind of keep doing it absolutely 100% um
[68:01] were you previously on on Twitter as you
[68:03] sadly you're now just on Nostra or you
[68:05] you switched or you never started
[68:07] Twitter you know I I had a pretty good
[68:09] following on Twitter for a really long
[68:11] time but I think it just it started um
[68:14] just taking more and more of my time
[68:16] during the day and I just kind of
[68:17] realized that it's uh it's probably best
[68:20] just to focus on the real world stuff
[68:22] and not things that I have no control
[68:25] over over you know it's kind of came to
[68:28] that like two two two and a half years
[68:29] ago oh nice yeah so perfect uh really
[68:33] cool um perfect then let's let's come uh
[68:36] to the end of the podcast we always have
[68:38] two questions uh in the podcast the one
[68:41] question is always the same question for
[68:42] each guest uh what can we learn from you
[68:45] besides
[68:47] Bitcoin oh man I I really really love
[68:50] watching like films like I I'm
[68:52] fascinated by films fascinated by film
[68:55] directors
[68:56] I love reading about them I love reading
[68:58] biographies like I'm very obsessed with
[69:00] that um so um that's one of the one of
[69:04] the things that you could ask me a
[69:06] question about a film or ask me a
[69:07] question about a director and I would
[69:09] know probably something about it I I'm
[69:11] still working on my European catalog
[69:13] trying to I just I just saw this movie
[69:15] this past weekend called Victoria it's a
[69:17] it's a it's a German movie um and all
[69:21] done in like 140 minutes it's one shot
[69:23] one single shot and it it takes place in
[69:26] a span of like you know two and a half
[69:27] hours in some place in like in in Berlin
[69:30] I think and amazing film in the in the
[69:33] 2015 I think when it came out and uh I
[69:36] was just like Blown Away how like near
[69:38] perfect the film was but looking into it
[69:40] you kind of find out that they actually
[69:42] shot that movie three times because it's
[69:44] it starts off like 4 in the morning it
[69:46] ends closer to like 6:30 7 in the
[69:48] morning and the last time that they
[69:51] filmed it um was the was the one that
[69:53] they kept in the film and and never
[69:55] broke cut like it never it never cut the
[69:57] actors just memorize exactly where they
[69:59] needed to go throughout the whole movie
[70:01] and it takes place in like two mile Five
[70:04] Mile block radius but um yeah it's
[70:06] called Victoria no Veronica not Victoria
[70:10] Veronica that that that's fascinating I
[70:13] have an interesting question for
[70:15] you because there's obvious uh Bitcoin
[70:19] movies that are not about Bitcoin like
[70:22] the Matrix um last time asked that same
[70:26] question that I will give you now uh the
[70:28] answer was Bobby so keep that in mind um
[70:33] the question is what is the most
[70:35] unexpected Bitcoin movie that is not
[70:37] about
[70:40] Bitcoin I think it's the first one I
[70:42] ever saw like where I realized I was
[70:44] like that is a Bitcoin movie and then it
[70:46] was later on where I realized other
[70:48] people knew it was a it was like a
[70:50] Bitcoin movie but at the time I didn't
[70:52] think about it like that um probably
[70:54] fight
[70:56] um where I was yeah that's totally a
[70:58] Bitcoin movie but at the time I didn't
[71:00] think it was and then you watch it back
[71:02] and you're like yep those guys look like
[71:04] they would all be
[71:06] bitcoiners except the the first rule of
[71:08] the fat club yeah you don't talk about
[71:10] Bitcoin yeah yeah Fight Club yeah it's
[71:13] like the reverse of that it's like you
[71:16] talk about Bitcoin all day long until
[71:18] everyone gets annoyed by it yeah for
[71:20] sure yeah for sure really cool thank you
[71:23] so much um we have entered it in the
[71:24] podcast where the previous guest is
[71:26] asking a question for the next guest
[71:27] without knowing who the next guest
[71:29] actually is uh and uh your question is a
[71:32] really interesting one do you think we
[71:35] will have a block size increase within
[71:37] the next 10
[71:39] years wow that's a tough
[71:42] one gosh do I have to say yes or no or
[71:46] can I just like say I don't know because
[71:48] I honestly don't know but uh I
[71:52] think if I had to give an answer right
[71:54] now I would say no
[71:56] but um but I I would say I don't know
[71:59] yeah it's it's a really interesting uh
[72:02] conversation I just had it also in El
[72:04] salador I talked with someone like a
[72:06] little bit longer on that because on the
[72:08] one hand if if if we go ahead and
[72:12] actually do that we kind of open the the
[72:15] flood gate of like potential future
[72:18] increases uh at the other hand it's like
[72:22] why don't we increase it we don't
[72:23] increase it to have fully decentralized
[72:26] because of the full node to have the
[72:28] cost of a full node low but the space
[72:32] the storage of the full node uh uh is
[72:35] also getting cheaper and cheaper with
[72:37] advancing technology so maybe we can
[72:39] actually uh because like if if the uh if
[72:43] the cost of I don't know at one terabyte
[72:47] or the cost of storing the full Bitcoin
[72:52] note right now is dropping like 10x or
[72:55] like 5x or something like that if that
[72:57] drops a lot why not increase it 2x the
[73:00] block size it's it's a logical argument
[73:02] but then on the other hand once you
[73:04] increase
[73:05] it then maybe something happens where
[73:08] like increase it all the time and then
[73:10] all of the sudden it gets so big so it's
[73:12] a really difficult topic who was that
[73:14] who was that you were talking with so I
[73:16] can check it out when it comes out I
[73:18] know that was not recorded actually this
[73:22] it was just on the Salvador trip I I
[73:24] don't record podcasts when I'm on
[73:26] conferences so I can focus on the
[73:28] conference and be like present there uh
[73:31] but there are some conversations uh I
[73:33] just had that while walking through
[73:35] through S Salvador so it was not even
[73:39] official trip or something like that uh
[73:40] but yeah it would be fun
[73:42] to uh watch that or like record that
[73:47] somebody recommended that block siiz
[73:48] wars book that I still haven't checked
[73:49] out U I think it's I think it's just
[73:51] City in my library and audible but um I
[73:54] need to go read that CU I'm sure they
[73:56] they kind of talk about that too I think
[73:58] for me I think I've um you know we we
[74:01] focus more on lightning here in PL I we
[74:02] do Bitcoin stuff too on chain stuff but
[74:05] um just from what the the guys tell me
[74:08] here it does seem like you know it's
[74:09] just going to take some time for
[74:11] lighting to scale and do all that sort
[74:13] of thing and it's just um so that's kind
[74:16] of where we're at right now with all
[74:17] that I think but interesting more into
[74:20] it absolutely and it's it's it's also
[74:23] for me uh we we 100% need um Layer Two
[74:28] like we will never scale uh to 8 billion
[74:31] people uh on the on the base layer that
[74:34] I think that's just not possible um so
[74:37] we we need scalability on Layer Two
[74:39] maybe on on Lightning maybe fim Min
[74:42] maybe liquid whatever I'm not that
[74:44] technical unfortunately so there has to
[74:47] be a really good argument for me uh to
[74:51] scale up the block size more than just
[74:54] oh yeah like C came down like oh but
[74:57] just because we we can do it like why
[74:59] should we do it like what is the actual
[75:02] Improvement uh the actual like show show
[75:06] me like why it's so much better to open
[75:10] that fundamental piece of Bitcoin that
[75:12] we fought so long in the bless War uh so
[75:15] that's also for me like uh it has to be
[75:17] really solid argument but I'm not saying
[75:19] it will never happen I'm just saying
[75:21] like it has to be such a air tight solid
[75:27] argument uh for me to convince to be
[75:29] like four bigger blocks uh that I also
[75:33] wouldn't say it will happen in next 10
[75:35] years uh but I I I think it's possible
[75:39] but if I had to choose one I would also
[75:41] ask you uh choose no uh just for for
[75:44] that reason yeah yeah I think you're
[75:46] right I I honestly don't know that's not
[75:48] my my area expertise but um I would say
[75:51] no by default but yeah interesting
