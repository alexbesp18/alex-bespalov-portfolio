[00:00] all we need is like a few big news and
[00:02] then we will see the Rockets this is a
[00:04] adoption wave that not a lot of people
[00:07] have on their radar there is no second
[00:08] best to bitcoin there's only 21 million
[00:11] Bitcoins ever we are now at 95% in in 10
[00:15] years it's going to be 99% and the last
[00:17] 1% will take over 100 years to mine
[00:19] Bitcoin doesn't have a CEO Bitcoin
[00:21] doesn't have any employees that's why we
[00:24] have to be vocal about it once you have
[00:26] Bitcoin as your unit of account and your
[00:29] like store value you look at Investments
[00:31] differently it's a fascinating time to
[00:33] be alive and to be a bitcoiner don't
[00:35] don't take the profits Bitcoin is the
[00:37] profit Bitcoin is the exit you don't you
[00:40] don't trade your Bitcoin to
[00:42] [Music]
[00:45] FIA hi Peter how you doing everything
[00:47] fine hi Robin every everything fine in
[00:50] uh in Turk um so I think it's raining
[00:54] today here so I won't I won't be needing
[00:56] this this uh Bitcoin Shades but uh I'll
[00:59] just go
[01:01] out definely but so first I would like
[01:04] to congratulate you Robin on something
[01:07] because I I understood that you you
[01:09] locked Michael sailor to your to your
[01:11] podcast as a guest so I think it's
[01:12] pretty pretty amazing thing and uh and
[01:15] also it's it's quite an honor to be in
[01:17] the same podcast with the father of
[01:19] Bitcoin corporate adoption so uh that's
[01:22] a that's a pretty cool topic actually
[01:25] yeah thank you yeah it's it's it's
[01:26] fascinating for me that he just said yes
[01:29] to it I'm like I'm just a random small
[01:31] Bitcoin podcaster and I was just
[01:34] shooting my shot and said like hey
[01:35] Michael saor I would love to to have you
[01:37] on the podcast and he's like yeah
[01:38] definitely let's do it and we even doing
[01:40] it um um in person in brag uh so it will
[01:45] be iners podcast with him and will be
[01:48] also my first ever in-person podcast
[01:52] that I ever did and then directly with
[01:55] like one of the the best people in in in
[01:58] Bitcoin the biggest people in Bitcoin uh
[02:00] but your your background is also in in
[02:02] in companies and you adopted also for
[02:04] your for your company the the the micro
[02:06] strategy Playbook so let's talk a little
[02:09] bit uh about
[02:12] that yeah I'll start with the with micro
[02:15] strategy story because I have I have a
[02:17] professional link with the micro
[02:20] strategy uh since 2008 actually so it's
[02:25] it's a funny funny um funny link to
[02:27] sailor and micro strategy because we
[02:30] know that Michael sailor he he founded
[02:32] micro strategy and I was actually in in
[02:35] in bi Consulting back then in my my home
[02:38] country
[02:39] Finland and I was sent to a a micro
[02:43] strategy certification training to
[02:46] London so I became a micro strategy
[02:50] certified engineer in 2008 like one
[02:54] month before the white paper Bitcoin
[02:56] white paper was published so it's it's a
[03:00] really it's a really funny link to to
[03:02] micro strategy and and Bitcoin there
[03:05] from from my professional background and
[03:08] yes definitely so this this uh micro
[03:10] strategy
[03:11] Playbook Bitcoin as a treasury Reserve
[03:14] asset it's I I think it's it's clever
[03:17] it's extremely clever um idea and for my
[03:21] own company here in Switzerland we are
[03:24] now in the
[03:25] process of of introducing that same same
[03:29] strategy
[03:30] also uh in in cooperation with
[03:33] relay so that's definitely I mean if a
[03:37] startup or anme can do it then any
[03:41] company can do it right so it's it's not
[03:43] rocket science yeah for me is the whole
[03:46] whole story with uh smmes and and and
[03:50] even bigger companies like we have apple
[03:52] Google and all those those big uh
[03:54] companies like this is a adoption wave
[03:58] that not a lot of people have on the
[04:00] radar because micro strategy did it uh a
[04:03] few other companies are doing it
[04:04] publicly traded companies are doing it
[04:07] uh and when you look at the S&P 500
[04:10] there's like one company that has kind
[04:12] of some Bitcoins that's
[04:15] Tesla and no one else has it I may maybe
[04:18] micro strategy comes soon in the S&P 500
[04:20] then there's like really a big player in
[04:23] there but there's so much potential of
[04:27] uh cash that will flood into Bitcoin
[04:29] once wants more and more get into this
[04:32] and like at a certain point when like I
[04:35] don't know uh 10 companies or 50
[04:38] companies of the S&B 500 do it then all
[04:41] of them will talk about it all of them
[04:43] have to answer in the investors call
[04:45] like oh why did you not have a a Bitcoin
[04:47] strategy so like for me that's a really
[04:50] big adoption wave that that that that
[04:53] could come but yeah let's let's talk
[04:54] about like why should should someone
[04:57] adopt the the micro strategy Playbook
[04:59] and The Playbook that you also doing
[05:01] like what's the reason for a company to
[05:03] to do that actually I mean as a reserve
[05:06] asset there is no there is no second
[05:07] best uh to bitcoin that's pretty clear
[05:10] because if you look at long
[05:13] term there is no better store of value
[05:15] than Bitcoin so it's it's it's it's not
[05:19] really like I said it's not rocket
[05:20] science if you look if you look long
[05:22] term if you hold if you huddle four
[05:25] years minimum you can't lose so
[05:29] therefore I mean like for any any retail
[05:33] investor or private
[05:35] individual having Bitcoin it's the same
[05:38] story I mean it's it's the best store of
[05:40] value and and hedge against inflation so
[05:43] yeah and yeah and it's that answer to uh
[05:49] that horrible traditional Financial
[05:51] system that we that you have but you you
[05:54] spent uh I think in the bio I saw it
[05:57] that you have spent like 10 plus years
[05:58] in that traditional Financial system so
[06:01] you're probably one of the the best
[06:02] guest to ask like what's wrong with that
[06:06] like you have a pretty good
[06:08] understanding of of the traditional
[06:10] financial markets and and what the what
[06:12] the system is doing um like what did you
[06:16] do there and and and what did you saw
[06:18] that is going wrong with the traditional
[06:21] financial
[06:22] markets so my my professional background
[06:25] is I was I was um always a more or less
[06:27] a data an IT guy 20 plus years now so I
[06:31] have been building and running uh global
[06:33] data Platforms in in various Industries
[06:36] um such as um big Pharma
[06:38] telecommunications Commodities trading
[06:41] electrical engineering and financial
[06:43] services so and there there there have
[06:45] been also in in financial services uh
[06:47] spearheading like you know large it
[06:50] programs digital transformation
[06:52] initiatives um many years and and
[06:56] basically I just couldn't take the
[06:57] corporate politics anymore and I I
[07:00] became independent and started my own
[07:01] company so but but uh speaking of
[07:04] financial services and the problems that
[07:06] we have there it's pretty clear like the
[07:08] Central Bank Run Run system where we
[07:10] create money Al money out of thin air
[07:14] and we sell our value like Precious time
[07:18] against that money that is not even even
[07:20] scars it's just being it's it's being
[07:22] printed out of thin air and there's
[07:25] nothing behind so that's pretty much in
[07:28] the nutshell what's wrong with the whole
[07:29] fin Financial system and Bitcoin is the
[07:33] perfect uh hedge against that inflation
[07:36] that is being uh caused by this money
[07:39] printing yeah you also in Swiss which is
[07:41] a I feel like a unique perspective
[07:44] because as we talked before like bit uh
[07:47] the Swiss has with the Swiss frank the
[07:49] the the best shitcoin in the world and
[07:52] it was also the count that was last of
[07:55] the gold standard so Swiss might be that
[07:59] that's small window that we have right
[08:01] now how
[08:03] Bitcoin how a Bitcoin standard could
[08:06] actually look like of course Swiss is
[08:08] not on a Bitcoin standard they they also
[08:10] have not the gold standard but uh I feel
[08:14] like Swiss has a this different wipe to
[08:17] it it's
[08:18] something let's talk about like how is
[08:21] how is the Swiss different now do do the
[08:23] rest of the world and how could this
[08:25] lead to like why Bitcoin is such a good
[08:28] uh sound money system for us from a
[08:31] regulatory perspective if you if you
[08:33] think of Switzerland it's extremely
[08:35] Bitcoin friendly and um you know we we
[08:39] talk about shitcoins a lot and we have
[08:40] ethereum and we have cardos and all
[08:43] those and the crypto Valley in t um
[08:46] which is next to the traditional Fiat
[08:50] Finance Center Turk so it's funny that
[08:52] we have these two two different worlds
[08:54] like next to each other here um in in
[08:57] Switzerland and and also Al the the
[09:00] central bank I think they have been
[09:02] quite Progressive in their in their
[09:05] strategies like in in the past with with
[09:09] um with investing in in in various um
[09:12] various instruments there and I think
[09:14] there there is a big potential that
[09:16] Swiss Central Bank might even adopt
[09:19] Bitcoin at some point um because I think
[09:24] the general opinion about Bitcoin in
[09:26] this country is extremely positive and
[09:28] you have the point of sales number of
[09:30] Point of Sales in Switzerland is
[09:31] extremely high also in global terms
[09:35] where you can pay using
[09:38] Bitcoin and even in Canton for example
[09:41] you can pay your taxes with
[09:44] Bitcoin if you I mean you're stupid
[09:46] enough to pay your taxes with Bitcoin
[09:49] but I wouldn't do it but you know it's
[09:52] it's technically possible and also in in
[09:54] in Lugano where you have the plan B um
[09:57] it's extremely you widespread you can
[10:01] pay with Bitcoin almost anywhere there
[10:05] so Switzerland definitely is is a great
[10:07] place to be um for a bitcoiner and
[10:11] there's also um no capital gain tax here
[10:14] so so there's like if you sell Bitcoin
[10:18] uh or you use it to to pay for something
[10:21] you don't have to pay anything yeah zero
[10:24] capital gain tax yeah a really nice is
[10:27] is it the same uh like when I talk to
[10:31] outside of my Bitcoin world to people in
[10:34] Austria I have a lot of FS coming my way
[10:38] as the the the climate and energy
[10:40] consumption is is still a big thing uh
[10:43] what people are saying uh we people also
[10:46] saying no we need inflation uh
[10:48] deflationary system would be not good
[10:51] like there are a lot of different things
[10:52] that are here in the normal world is
[10:54] that still also in Do Do Well
[10:59] I don't know it's in in in public
[11:02] discussion it's of course there's always
[11:04] this this fake news around because you
[11:07] know the mainstream media we all know
[11:09] how it is I mean they what they tell is
[11:13] mostly what whatever whatever they tell
[11:16] is is I I would I would really look it
[11:18] through a a different filter you
[11:21] know so basically the whole energy topic
[11:25] that I find it hilarious because
[11:26] everybody Bitcoin consumes so much
[11:28] energy and more and more like country EX
[11:31] for example you know and and in the
[11:35] end if you think of the whole banking
[11:37] industry how much it takes energy and
[11:41] cost to run that whole circus around
[11:44] Fiat currencies plus plus to secure that
[11:48] you need the military operations on top
[11:51] I mean how much us
[11:54] spends on securing US dollar and and
[11:58] they interest around the world with the
[12:00] petrol dollar you know imagine the whole
[12:03] Army the military spending how much they
[12:06] do I mean they they spend like 10
[12:09] times um 10 times
[12:12] more than any other country or no sorry
[12:15] it was like they spent more than um all
[12:18] of the others in top 10 combined that's
[12:21] the military budget it's
[12:25] insane it's it's and just to secure just
[12:28] to secure the the fiat currency but a
[12:31] part of that probably would also like do
[12:34] you think that those military uh
[12:37] operations and uh those border controls
[12:40] and that
[12:43] uh what is
[12:45] breaking the line is breing breing yeah
[12:49] the uh the internet line yes yes yes now
[12:52] it's better but that was like you were
[12:54] you were frozen for a while oh okay okay
[12:57] okay so but could you hear me yes now
[13:00] now I could hear you yeah yes okay no no
[13:03] no problem like sometimes it's um a
[13:06] little bit swigle but uh in the end
[13:09] podcast when it comes out then uh those
[13:12] will not be there because Riverside up
[13:15] uploads
[13:16] the the the best quality audio and video
[13:20] locally uh so like okay the the zoom
[13:25] call Quality we have now is just now
[13:27] while speaking m and afterwards uh the
[13:32] the best quality audio and video gets
[13:34] uploaded that's what you also see with
[13:36] the uploading sign uh and and this is
[13:39] like then compined to it uh to it but I
[13:42] I see you all the time really okay good
[13:45] so it should be fine okay that's good to
[13:47] know yeah so you usually the the end
[13:52] product is extremely clean uh and has no
[13:55] wiggle room and even if there's like I
[13:58] have afterwards like a small tool that
[14:00] runs over the uh the
[14:04] paes and and when there's like a long
[14:07] pause in there it it sees that and just
[14:10] cuts that out
[14:12] automatically and so the the whole
[14:15] process is uh great cool I I like it a
[14:20] lot it makes it makes podcasting way
[14:23] easier than it used to be otherwise you
[14:24] have to listen to it and see like what's
[14:26] going on and put it and edit but yeah
[14:30] perfect yeah let's let's let's continue
[14:33] with with Bitcoin one thing that I um I
[14:36] wanted to ask you what do you think is
[14:39] the the main misconception that people
[14:41] have like what because we understand
[14:43] Bitcoin and we are here and we think
[14:46] that Bitcoin will be fully adopted at
[14:48] some point
[14:50] but it's but we have to get over some
[14:53] hurdles like it's all education in in in
[14:55] my opinion what do you think is like the
[14:57] main misconception the main hurdle that
[14:59] people have to go through to understand
[15:03] Bitcoin to to get to this full Bitcoin
[15:06] standard and how can we improve also our
[15:09] messaging around
[15:10] that so I'll I I'll tell about my own
[15:14] own story so how did I how did I get
[15:17] into the Bitcoin what is my my rabbit ho
[15:19] story and I think that also answers the
[15:21] question from from my perspective so I
[15:23] first first heard about uh a Bitcoin
[15:26] from a friend I think
[15:27] 2014 15 something like that and and um I
[15:33] mean it sounded good of course I didn't
[15:35] get it immediately and I also opened
[15:38] account on I think Ken back then but I
[15:40] didn't
[15:42] buy I didn't buy Bitcoin but I opened an
[15:45] account already back then but but then
[15:47] um more and more friends started talking
[15:50] about it and and and then in 2016 I I I
[15:54] bought my first first uh first steak and
[16:00] but still the thing is I I didn't
[16:03] understand what I was doing I didn't
[16:06] fully understand Bitcoin because I mean
[16:09] when you start you you rarely many of
[16:12] many of us didn't probably understand
[16:14] fully
[16:16] Bitcoin when you first bought it and and
[16:19] it's it's a journey it takes takes a lot
[16:21] of time to to actually grasp what's
[16:23] what's what's the whole value behind it
[16:27] and that happened also so to me and and
[16:30] of course Bitcoin it gained a lot of
[16:32] value between 2016 and and 2020 21 and
[16:37] and I did all the mistakes you can do
[16:40] actually so I was I was even selling
[16:42] Bitcoin to buy
[16:45] shitcoin yes I the biggest mistake of my
[16:47] life I was selling I was taking the
[16:49] profit out right to to buy ethereum and
[16:53] and Shiba Inu or Solana whatever
[16:56] shitcoin you know that's like so stupid
[16:57] and and trying to know also beat the
[16:59] market and do like day trading
[17:02] and all all the possible mistakes you
[17:05] can you can do as a as as a bitcoiner I
[17:09] did but then um I I started to really
[17:12] really understand the the the real value
[17:15] the scarcity in in uh like four four
[17:18] years ago and ever since I've been only
[17:21] buying and and hodling and and not not
[17:25] selling one one one single Satoshi
[17:29] and that was actually also for me the
[17:33] the whole idea behind it the covid time
[17:37] the whole circus it opened my eyes and
[17:40] and made me understand with this money
[17:42] Printing and and uh
[17:44] inflation that was I was then then
[17:46] caused by it that Bitcoin really is the
[17:52] only only way to store the value in in
[17:57] the long run
[17:59] and and that was for me the eye opener
[18:01] as well and that I think that is also
[18:02] that the people need to understand that
[18:05] there's only 21 million Bitcoins ever we
[18:08] are now at
[18:09] 95% in in 10 years it's going to be 99%
[18:13] and the last 1% will take over 100 years
[18:16] to mine so it's just once you understand
[18:20] that it's already a good
[18:22] start and it it won't be there won't be
[18:25] any more Bitcoin created out of thin air
[18:28] like you can print these uh these Fiat
[18:31] currencies and and Sheet coins as
[18:34] well like um etherum for example it it
[18:38] became now a um a commodity according to
[18:41] SEC and it's it's got nothing to do with
[18:43] commodity I mean it's a it's a shitcoin
[18:46] that you just print out of thin air it's
[18:47] like cryp these these cryptos they are
[18:50] like Fiat currencies in digital format
[18:54] without government backing so it's like
[18:56] cbdcs without government but but you
[18:59] know there this I I I don't get it I
[19:02] mean why why why would anybody buy
[19:05] ethereum I did I did earlier but now I'm
[19:11] I'm smart enough to to say that I I
[19:13] wouldn't do it
[19:14] again what made you understand uh that
[19:17] altcoins are no alternative to bitcoin
[19:19] and they are just shitcoins like what
[19:22] what was the Mind switch that you had to
[19:23] make like that's it's Bitcoin only and
[19:26] not the other cryptos because lot of
[19:29] people still did not make it and a lot
[19:31] of people still like oh I just buy the
[19:33] 10 top 10 coins or something like
[19:35] that yeah
[19:39] well the scarcity right you you you
[19:42] understand that with
[19:43] Bitcoin just can't create it more it's
[19:46] that 21 million gap and that's it um and
[19:49] and also what what was for me it was
[19:51] also a big um big red red flag with
[19:56] ethereum when they changed the you know
[19:58] the algorithm to to proof of
[20:00] stake and and the whole thing I mean
[20:03] they have uh the founding team they they
[20:05] have the I mean it's a foundation but
[20:08] but they still
[20:10] have the whole it's it's a centralized
[20:13] currency like any any Fiat and and with
[20:17] with proof of stake algorithm it's a
[20:19] scan basically that's my opinion yeah
[20:22] and and it's so obvious because proof of
[20:24] stake means you
[20:26] have uh people that stake have a say in
[20:31] what's going to happen with ethereum and
[20:35] then when we come to for example stocks
[20:37] you have investors and you have
[20:39] stakeholders uh who when they have uh
[20:43] stocks in the in company they can have a
[20:45] say in what's happening so for me
[20:48] altcoins are the same concept as they
[20:52] are with stocks because they are just
[20:56] uh an an in initial like there are just
[20:59] people who have a stake in it there's
[21:01] also
[21:02] premine it's it's the same thing as as a
[21:05] as an issuance in in a company in the
[21:07] stocks so the I don't know what's
[21:10] different about it maybe uh cryptos are
[21:14] the new way of starting companies I
[21:15] don't think so uh but but that's the
[21:18] only only reason I can think of that
[21:21] there might be some use case other than
[21:23] that it's like why would you do that and
[21:27] and and I don't know if uh the SSE
[21:31] long-term really wants that that there
[21:34] are crypto
[21:37] companies that are issuing money without
[21:42] uh registering with the security
[21:44] exchange can because they can just do it
[21:47] h they don't have to go through the
[21:48] hurdle that you have to go through when
[21:50] you go public so will be really
[21:52] interesting to see and I think there
[21:54] will be at some point like a complete
[21:56] Crackdown on almost all [ __ ] coins
[21:59] probably not all but almost all will be
[22:03] gone from the regulatory perspective um
[22:06] uh and if if the regulatory don't don't
[22:10] do anything against it uh the free
[22:13] market will do it for them correct and
[22:18] and if you think of um what what will
[22:21] happen next um because this opens the
[22:23] Pandora's Box for all the shitcoins
[22:26] ethereum getting this status I think
[22:28] that's that's a big risk because then
[22:30] then I mean why why wouldn't any like a
[22:33] dog going or whatever cat coin or
[22:35] hamster coin why wouldn't they get the
[22:37] the same treatment as as
[22:40] ethereum from
[22:42] SEC so we'll be we flooded with all
[22:45] these spot ETFs of of various meme coins
[22:48] and I I don't see it as a as a good good
[22:51] development and I'm feel I'm feel sorry
[22:53] for the people who who uh invested their
[22:57] money in that uh in that CR
[23:00] yeah and it's it's it's it's uh it's
[23:04] it's usually just sad to see I mean
[23:05] there are some that where I'm like oh
[23:08] yeah he has a lot of money he he just
[23:10] doesn't think he just like oh there's a
[23:12] crypto asset I will buy 10% with my
[23:15] Networth in just whole group to I don't
[23:16] feel sorry for them but there are a lot
[23:18] of people that listen to that crap and
[23:22] they are not in a good Financial uh
[23:24] position and all of the sudden they get
[23:27] dragged into that and like because of
[23:29] some scammer he will lose half of his um
[23:34] his his his life his life savings and
[23:38] this is
[23:40] why like I'm on the one side I'm like I
[23:44] don't care about shitcoins about Al
[23:47] coins what what they are doing I could
[23:49] just not mention them because like if if
[23:52] someone wants to invest in that it's
[23:53] their their fault like I don't care for
[23:55] them the free market will take care of
[23:57] it the other side there are people that
[23:59] are suffering because of that and and uh
[24:02] those are usually afterwards really big
[24:05] bitcoiners we I heard a lot of stories
[24:07] about that but yeah it's it's it's
[24:09] important to to to speak up uh and
[24:13] against that uh one question around the
[24:17] topic before we move on do you have a
[24:19] theory why so many altcoins are still
[24:24] around why
[24:25] there's a good amount of of of money
[24:28] still in in in those altcoins in those
[24:31] shitcoins uh and why people still do
[24:34] this stay like I don't know when was the
[24:36] first shitcoin around uh the last 12
[24:39] years people still fall for for for this
[24:43] well it's it's clearly lack of
[24:45] understanding and also the the funny
[24:47] thing is that people but Bitcoin is so
[24:49] expensive it's like almost $70,000 per
[24:52] per coin and and yeah but ethereum it's
[24:55] only you know 3,000 something it's much
[24:59] cheaper I can I can buy a steak you know
[25:01] I can get the whole
[25:03] coin just they don't understand that's
[25:05] the problem there's lack of
[25:07] understanding still and that's why we
[25:08] have to that's why we have to um
[25:11] communicate this and because Bitcoin
[25:13] doesn't have a marketing department
[25:15] Bitcoin doesn't have a CEO Bitcoin
[25:17] doesn't have any employees you know
[25:19] that's why we have to be vocal about it
[25:22] and that's why I also I mean I've been
[25:23] in Bitcoin this eight years but I was
[25:25] never vocal about this uh like publicly
[25:28] I've been orange peeling my friends and
[25:30] and family they hate me for it you know
[25:31] but
[25:32] uh but you know I I started to be vocal
[25:36] because I I thought like every voice
[25:38] counts we need to we need to spread the
[25:41] word we need to tell the people that
[25:43] this is the the solution to to
[25:47] the
[25:48] inflation yeah absolutely and and uh
[25:52] thank you by the way for for taking the
[25:54] time and and and for for being on the
[25:55] show and and not hiding I mean I have
[25:58] full respect for anyone that wants to
[26:01] stay Anonymous and I have several
[26:03] podcasts on my show where the guest uh
[26:06] decided to be completely Anonymous uh
[26:09] like Wicket or other even quite popular
[26:13] Twitter accounts that but just never
[26:15] show their face um but I think if you
[26:19] can if if you can handle it from a
[26:22] security perspective and you are okay
[26:24] with that little bit of additional risk
[26:27] or maybe a little bit more of additional
[26:29] risk uh with being public and being
[26:31] known and being with the face and and
[26:33] and and name out there you should
[26:35] definitely do that because
[26:38] people people do what other people do
[26:42] and when they see a lot of faces
[26:44] associated with that Bitcoin thing it's
[26:47] better than just random accounts where
[26:50] they don't really know who's who's
[26:53] behind that and and what is is there
[26:55] face to it like people want to grasp
[26:57] cont content with real other human
[27:00] beings that's how we are wir and that's
[27:03] why it's so important to as Bitcoin is
[27:05] not to hide even though I respect
[27:07] anybody who who does that uh but that's
[27:10] just my my thing why I decided to to go
[27:13] out do you have a special reason why you
[27:16] decided not to hide and then come out
[27:18] strong and Loud inflation and and the
[27:21] whole the with the whole establishment
[27:23] that we have uh governing
[27:26] us I'm just kind of you not lost my
[27:29] faith in
[27:30] it that's why that's why I just couldn't
[27:32] couldn't uh be quiet anymore the pain
[27:36] the pain grew too
[27:38] big I had to open my mouth you know and
[27:41] and I mean I'm not afraid so I'm a big
[27:44] boy so anybody can try to you know
[27:47] whatever but uh if you are listening to
[27:50] this podcast you might be wondering what
[27:52] is actually the setup look like of Robin
[27:54] or how can I improve my Bitcoin setup
[27:57] and there's two things you have to buy
[27:59] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[28:01] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[28:03] let's focus on the first thing how to
[28:05] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[28:07] only exchange don't deal with the
[28:09] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[28:11] exchange that has an own token or
[28:13] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[28:15] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[28:19] for me the best partner for that and now
[28:22] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[28:24] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[28:26] a self custom solution where you
[28:29] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[28:32] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[28:35] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[28:38] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[28:40] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[28:45] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[28:47] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[28:50] have one last thing before we get back
[28:52] to the video I'm really passionate about
[28:54] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[28:56] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[28:59] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[29:03] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[29:05] conference in whole of Europe for all
[29:08] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[29:10] this place in June for all europees it's
[29:13] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[29:16] Bitcoin Pride conference you basically
[29:17] have to come I will do interviews there
[29:20] and I would love to meet you all there
[29:22] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[29:25] get discounts and use the links down in
[29:28] the
[29:29] description and and and I think the I
[29:33] mean every situation from every person
[29:35] is different but there are already so
[29:40] many vocal bitcoiners out there that
[29:44] it's
[29:45] not it's proven that it's possible to be
[29:49] not attacked constantly and and not have
[29:52] like there are so many Bitcoin podcasts
[29:55] out there there are really big vocal uh
[29:58] public speakers that have tens of
[30:00] thousands of hundred thousands even in
[30:02] in the millions of of followers and we
[30:06] don't see articles like oh he gots
[30:08] attacked he got stabbed he like he is
[30:11] bit so it seems that it's
[30:15] um it it seems that it's a big enough uh
[30:20] um pool of people that it's actually
[30:23] quite safe I I don't know how what's the
[30:27] future brings but I just I just felt
[30:29] like better be brave uh than than just
[30:33] come out and and be hiding behind
[30:37] something I like I want to tell my my
[30:39] kids that oh I was standing for that
[30:41] Revolution and I was uh doing that for
[30:45] for the better of humanity at least I
[30:46] think so that I'm doing it this teach us
[30:50] absolutely and and you know good that
[30:52] you mention kids because I have two and
[30:55] um you know the orange feeling it starts
[30:56] from home
[30:59] and so so um both of them actually they
[31:04] are still young enough to get the child
[31:06] allowance and what we do is is they they
[31:10] invest their child allowance directly to
[31:13] bitcoin every month so they have their
[31:15] own wallets and U have it transferred
[31:18] via relay to to their own uh to their
[31:21] own wallets do do they have 100% uh
[31:24] Bitcoin allowance or do they also get
[31:27] some Fier stack I have a wife you know
[31:30] so wife uh decided that they need also
[31:34] some she got stack so half of it goes to
[31:37] ETFs so but I I would be I would be 100%
[31:40] for for Bitcoin you
[31:42] know but she has she has 50% vote so
[31:46] proof of fake yeah
[31:50] yeah marriage is proof of stake yeah I
[31:55] know um uh but but you you can buy maybe
[31:59] a Bitcoin ETF with
[32:01] it yeah yeah that I think that might be
[32:05] the next next step yeah and and even
[32:09] even ETFs at some point will have a lot
[32:11] of Bitcoin in that when the the
[32:13] companies in the ETFs buy Bitcoin then
[32:17] even those like you will probably have
[32:21] not this also interesting for me is that
[32:23] the hurdle rate of of Bitcoin once you
[32:26] have Bitcoin as your your unit of
[32:28] account and your like store of value you
[32:31] look at Investments differently all of
[32:33] the sudden you're like do do I really
[32:35] invest in that do I really do that did
[32:39] did since since you adopted a Bitcoin
[32:41] standard something change in your
[32:44] professional and personal life when it
[32:45] comes to investing and time absolutely I
[32:48] mean uh I do I do the DCA like everybody
[32:52] in Bitcoin should do um weekly automated
[32:57] uh Pur
[32:58] purchase uh again via relay which is a
[33:01] great Swiss company I I really like
[33:03] their app and and everything so and and
[33:05] you have it's your keys so they don't
[33:07] hold your keys it's your keys your coins
[33:10] and and basically every
[33:12] dip when there's when there's a bigger
[33:14] dip I'm I'm buying also so it's um the
[33:19] DCA plus the the red candles those are
[33:24] the best candles so you know you just uh
[33:27] stack more when it when it goes goes red
[33:29] and then you have this this nice candl
[33:32] light dinners when it gets green as as
[33:34] well so you
[33:36] know I I really really um really like
[33:39] those both colors actually it depends
[33:41] you know just buy when it's red and then
[33:43] you just have a have a dinner when it's
[33:45] green yeah I I talked with uh some some
[33:48] CEOs of of Bitcoin exchanges and they
[33:52] always say when the price is flat not a
[33:56] lot of things are happening
[33:58] but when the price is going up or down
[34:01] people are buying like crazy it doesn't
[34:03] matter if the price is actually going up
[34:05] or down people like buy crazy on on the
[34:08] movements uh and and the the flat things
[34:12] there's like where only the like the DCA
[34:15] crowd is in there that just like has a
[34:17] DCA every month it just goes in but
[34:20] there are a lot of people that are
[34:24] actually buying with emotions and and
[34:28] buying when it goes down and buying when
[34:30] it goes up because then the the formal
[34:32] is starting in and oh I want to catch
[34:34] the the dip oh I want to catch the the
[34:37] uprise a lot of lot of emotional things
[34:40] uh involv yes I'm I'm actually I'm
[34:43] looking forward to the next formal
[34:45] because uh uh my prediction was after
[34:48] this uh spot ETF approval in in January
[34:51] that we will we will see 100,000 Bitcoin
[34:53] before
[34:54] June that was my prediction uh back then
[34:57] but but obviously you know the
[34:58] institutions it takes time with the due
[35:00] diligence and and all the approvals and
[35:03] uh committees and you know all that
[35:06] stuff in those corporations obviously
[35:08] takes takes longer that because now we
[35:10] have the retail investors of the
[35:11] maturity that have been buying the ETF
[35:13] we know that so that's uh that's still
[35:16] driven by the retail but when when when
[35:18] we have that big wave of of like
[35:22] institutional money really coming coming
[35:24] in and when we start to have have the
[35:28] the the huge huge candles Cod candles
[35:31] daily daily you know the best days for
[35:33] those candl light dinners um I think
[35:36] then then the foro comes in and uh that
[35:39] will be that will be insane what what
[35:42] we're going to witness I think even this
[35:44] year we it will happen so at some point
[35:47] we will see crazy crazy developments on
[35:50] on the Bitcoin front so you're saying
[35:52] that the
[35:54] ETF that we did not see the full power
[35:58] of the ETF yet and the most is still to
[36:00] come most is still to come I think this
[36:02] is just driven by retail
[36:05] mostly yeah yeah it it's it's
[36:08] fascinating for me to see when we have
[36:11] Bitcoin and and the price right now
[36:15] because this year we hit the the alltime
[36:19] high before the Haring which never
[36:20] happened before yes uh but it seems so
[36:24] calm like like like there's a little bit
[36:28] of Bitcoin talk in the elections in the
[36:32] US elections nothing in the European
[36:34] Union elections nothing in the Austrian
[36:36] election right now they don't talk about
[36:38] Bitcoin at all not not nothing about
[36:40] crypto anything in America they are a
[36:43] little further had they talk about
[36:44] Bitcoin in the election but there's
[36:47] nothing crazy going on it's it's it's a
[36:49] really calm time like we are around the
[36:51] all-time high not quite there but it's
[36:54] really calm and it's it's a cool time
[36:58] right now to build something in Bitcoin
[37:00] because it's not a bare Market but still
[37:02] it's uh it's a high like we are close to
[37:05] the alltime high but it's there's
[37:07] nothing going on the Google Trends are
[37:09] down everything is kind of slow and and
[37:12] and calm not too many craziness are
[37:16] happening and I feel like we could hit
[37:19] in the second half of the year uh an
[37:22] absolute foral half year where we like
[37:27] is coming in this is happening small
[37:29] businesses and all of the sudden those
[37:31] things that we building the last few
[37:33] months and half year or a year all of on
[37:36] coming and and really are strong yes
[37:39] with that is it also like you see it
[37:41] fully agree because it doesn't matter
[37:43] how much uh we communicate uh you know
[37:47] with Bitcoin blbs and whatever memes we
[37:50] post it doesn't matter until the fomo
[37:53] kicks in and that is the best marketing
[37:56] tool for for Bitcoin the price once we
[38:01] have I mean all we need is like a few
[38:04] big
[38:05] news and then we will see the Rockets
[38:08] launching do you do do you think that
[38:11] the the 100K bitcoin price will be the
[38:14] the major Catalyst for for the general
[38:17] population to to wake up and see like oh
[38:19] what the [ __ ] is happening yeah I think
[38:21] that's that's something that mainstream
[38:22] media also can't uh be completely quiet
[38:25] about I think that's that's going to be
[38:27] massive Catalyst
[38:29] 100,000 dollar Bitcoin but I
[38:32] think and the crazy thing to understand
[38:34] still here even with
[38:36] 100,000 per Bitcoin we're still so early
[38:40] it's insane how early we still are and
[38:43] and if you
[38:45] divide the let's say the number of
[38:48] dollar millionaires in the world you
[38:49] know you know this number right so if
[38:51] you divide that how much Bitcoin there
[38:53] will be for each of them I think it's
[38:56] 0.3
[39:00] around for Bitcoin for each millionaire
[39:04] for each dollar millionaire in the
[39:07] world and that tells tells a lot about
[39:10] the scarcity of of of of Bitcoin it's
[39:12] it's insane how how how scarse thing it
[39:15] is and we're still we're still in the
[39:18] beginning I think the being a whole coin
[39:22] will have a massive status like this
[39:25] will be like really rare
[39:27] at some point uh depends on how how far
[39:30] you look out but if you're Bitcoin
[39:33] standard and you have a whole coin this
[39:34] will be like like having half the city
[39:37] or your own half the city of of your
[39:39] state or something like that um what
[39:42] what do you think will be the status of
[39:45] a Satoshi millionaire because this is a
[39:48] goal that most people I I I assume most
[39:53] people who are listening to that
[39:55] probably can reach the status of a Satan
[39:57] millionaire or most of them will be
[39:59] probably already above that when you
[40:01] listen constantly to a Bitcoin podcast
[40:04] because Satan millionaire it doesn't
[40:06] even take $700 us right now uh and and
[40:10] when I see where most my people are they
[40:12] are like us USA Canada Europe uh and and
[40:18] those countries they are like the
[40:19] majority of my viewers so they
[40:22] definitely can afford 700 US dollar in
[40:26] in Bitcoin uh they they cannot afford to
[40:29] not have this kind of what what what do
[40:31] you think will be the status of those
[40:33] early adopters who are Sosi
[40:36] multimillionaires
[40:37] uh will this be similar to a Millionaire
[40:41] right now or maybe even better um being
[40:44] a Satoshi millionaire yes yeah well that
[40:47] depends depends on the on the scale of
[40:50] hyperinflation of course that's pretty
[40:52] much it you know how much how much um
[40:57] zeros there will
[40:59] be behind those uh numbers in the in the
[41:03] the Fiat Fiat bills that will be
[41:06] decisive but it's hard to predict but if
[41:09] you think of like um it's clear we have
[41:12] Bitcoin now it's top 10 in the world in
[41:16] all the
[41:17] assets we have um less than 10
[41:21] companies that are bigger than Bitcoin
[41:24] we have gold and silver still there and
[41:27] and we have we have uh bypassed 58,000
[41:30] publicly listed companies already which
[41:33] is a huge huge number so if we think
[41:36] that if we reach the or when we reach
[41:41] the value of
[41:43] gold the the market
[41:45] cap um it's it's going to be 10 Xs and
[41:49] more and that's going to I think that's
[41:51] going to happen sooner or later it's a
[41:54] question of when not if uh and and um
[41:58] but then if you think of Would It Go
[42:01] like 100 IGS or thousand IGS versus what
[42:05] is it now I mean it's it's it's possible
[42:09] because if you think of all the the
[42:11] wealth in the
[42:13] world if uh if if let's say 5% of the
[42:17] the whole wealth in the world would go
[42:19] into Bitcoin we would be in a in a
[42:21] totally different price range than now
[42:24] it's I think a lot about that because
[42:26] when you you see for
[42:28] example like I was a stock investor
[42:31] before and before I started with Bitcoin
[42:34] I was actually planning on starting with
[42:37] real estate so if I would not be in
[42:40] Bitcoin right now fully 100% in there I
[42:43] only own Bitcoin right now and and some
[42:46] lights and the camera and something like
[42:48] that but outside of that I only own on
[42:50] on bitcoin um I would have been a stock
[42:55] investor real estate it uh maybe have
[42:58] some gold maybe have some other assets
[43:01] um and when you look at the bitcoiners
[43:05] the the most of them have um only
[43:08] Bitcoin then some of them have a house
[43:11] that they live in also some of them has
[43:13] maybe some gold uh like to to like have
[43:16] some gold coins if like the whole system
[43:18] breaks down and we don't have Internet
[43:20] so like it's it's it's not a bad idea to
[43:22] have some gold coins living around where
[43:24] like 1% of your Bel for like Z .5% of
[43:27] your wealth is in there uh maybe not a
[43:30] too bad of an idea uh even though I
[43:33] would not recommend it but it's a fair
[43:35] game um and then real estate and all
[43:39] those things are kind of misused as a
[43:42] store of value these days uh and I'm one
[43:46] of the examples who would be in those
[43:49] put my financial energy in those but I
[43:51] choose Bitcoin when more and more people
[43:54] do this and more and po more and more
[43:56] people real iiz Bitcoin is a superior
[43:59] technology for saving uh saving your
[44:03] financial energy yeah because it is uh
[44:07] transferable over the whole world you
[44:08] can take it over every border with 12
[44:11] words in your head and all those things
[44:13] that we we we we repeated so many times
[44:16] on this podcast when they all realize
[44:18] that like who who will save his money in
[44:22] real estate who will save his money in
[44:25] in an ETF
[44:27] does this not delete all the use case
[44:31] for an
[44:32] ETF does because I mean the companies
[44:35] they can print shares
[44:37] right it's pretty simple then there then
[44:40] this is all other thing with feat
[44:42] currencies um do do do you think they
[44:45] can survive if if uh if if we have
[44:48] Bitcoin coming out and everyone is
[44:50] adopting a Bitcoin standard and and I
[44:52] don't say like the next 50 years or 10
[44:54] years because I don't think it will be a
[44:56] fast position but if we look at 200
[44:59] years 500 years can can can Fe survive
[45:02] this what is the average um age of a
[45:05] field currency um I think uh it it was
[45:09] really low 100 years or something like
[45:12] that yeah yeah it was it was it was low
[45:14] Yeah Yeah so
[45:16] basically every fiat currency dies in
[45:19] the end so there's there's no fiat
[45:21] currency that survives uh forever so I
[45:24] think US dollar is the the longest
[45:27] uh surviving fiat currency at the moment
[45:31] but it's it's actually 27 years I just
[45:35] looked it up oh yeah 27 years I mean
[45:38] there are some different articles who
[45:40] say 35 years some say 50 years but all
[45:43] of them say one under 100
[45:46] years so that's that's that's
[45:49] fascinating it's insane how low actually
[45:52] it is and and how old is Euro now um
[45:57] 23 22 years I think it was 2002 um they
[46:02] they launched it and it's 22 years now
[46:04] and I think the whole currency is like
[46:07] uh it's already pretty much dead and and
[46:11] if you look at the USD and and the the
[46:14] national debt that they generate at the
[46:16] moment you know to speed like one one
[46:19] trillion in every five weeks I mean is
[46:22] it sustainable no one I mean 1 trillion
[46:25] is 1,000 billion every five
[46:28] weeks it's like insane amount of money
[46:33] that is being printed at the moment so
[46:36] this is definitely this this whole thing
[46:37] is not sustainable and I it's it's a
[46:40] it's an really it's a fascinating time
[46:42] to be alive and to be a bitcoiner at
[46:45] this time because I think this is
[46:47] something that we're going to W witness
[46:50] during the next five years yeah to 10
[46:52] years it's going to be massive and I
[46:55] think people don't understand how much a
[46:57] trillion actually
[46:58] is exactly people think like it's from a
[47:02] million to a billion it's one step and
[47:04] from a billion to trillion is one step
[47:07] uh but there's this example like 1
[47:10] million seconds versus one billion
[47:13] seconds I don't know the exact numbers
[47:15] but it's like something like uh 1
[47:17] million seconds uh it's like a few days
[47:21] uh and uh 1 billion seconds are few
[47:24] years mhm uh and and the difference is
[47:28] just so gigantic yes between a million
[47:32] and a billion like being a
[47:35] millionaire you you can quite easily
[47:39] achieve if you're hardworking and you
[47:40] put a lot of time in there being a
[47:43] billionaire that's a whole different
[47:45] level and we talking about trillions yes
[47:49] yes yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean the
[47:52] politicians I think they don't even
[47:54] understand the
[47:55] difference they don't don't they don't
[47:57] have they don't have no clue what
[47:59] they're doing or I don't know if they
[48:01] have a clue but uh looks like they don't
[48:04] have a clue yeah I they don't have a
[48:06] clue or they don't want to have a clue
[48:10] let say yeah I mean anyways it's it's I
[48:14] think the whole Bitcoin uh Bitcoin and
[48:16] and the understanding you know I think
[48:18] John Oliver said once that Bitcoin is
[48:20] everything people don't know about
[48:23] computers combined with everything they
[48:25] don't understand about money so I think
[48:29] that's I think that summarizes it pretty
[48:31] well yeah uh unfortunately that's very
[48:35] very
[48:37] true when I see the orange billing yeah
[48:40] um do you have a stacking like um a lot
[48:43] of people put put out like a target of
[48:45] like oh you have to get to one Bitcoin
[48:47] if you're n Bitcoin or you have to get
[48:49] to 0.1 Bitcoin if you're in Bitcoin now
[48:52] uh do you have like some some stacking
[48:54] goal that you are uh Comm communicating
[48:57] to your friends and families or to
[48:59] colleagues or like okay get to this or
[49:02] just like as much as you want
[49:04] um I mean it depends so I to some people
[49:08] I I say you know depend depending the
[49:10] wealth and everything how much they have
[49:12] in place
[49:13] but from 0.1 to to one so if somebody
[49:18] has a bit more as it yeah you know you
[49:20] should get to
[49:21] one yeah one somebody has a bit less get
[49:25] get at least two Z
[49:27] 0.1 that's like the minimum where you
[49:29] should actually
[49:31] get yeah and 0.1 will will get you a
[49:34] long way it's 10
[49:36] million yes yes it is it's a lot and and
[49:40] um my personal um stack I mean I had a
[49:44] goal I I achieved it um but um but the
[49:48] funny thing with Bitcoin you never had
[49:50] have you never have enough so you just
[49:52] uh just want to Stack
[49:55] more once you once you really once you
[49:57] really go deep into the rabbit hole and
[50:00] understand the real value behind it you
[50:02] just you can't stop amazing and before
[50:05] we come to closer to the end of the
[50:07] podcast um as you are adopting Bitcoin
[50:12] also on on on company balance sheets and
[50:14] you have uh an an experience in in
[50:17] corporate adoption in Bitcoin uh do you
[50:20] have advice for people who have their
[50:23] own companies right now uh and want to
[50:26] adopt the Bitcoin standard or they
[50:28] thinking about adopting a Bitcoin
[50:29] standard do you have any uh anything
[50:32] that you uh as adwise for for those kind
[50:35] of people that like how can we adopt a
[50:38] Bitcoin standard for for the company my
[50:40] advice is just um you don't have to
[50:42] start with the with a lot you know just
[50:45] with start with a small stack try it and
[50:49] let's say um once in a month small stake
[50:53] you got start with a few hundred bucks
[50:55] or a few thousand bucks depending on the
[50:57] the size of your company um you don't
[50:59] have to start with a million and and and
[51:02] really anyways just and see four years
[51:06] minimum take that as a as a minimum
[51:09] length for that um and and see how it
[51:12] performs and then you will see that okay
[51:16] oh actually wasn't that bad idea but
[51:18] it's it's it's a it's not a Sprint it's
[51:20] a marathon that's the thing with Bitcoin
[51:23] you can't well in the end four years is
[51:26] a Sprint
[51:28] right every cycle is a Sprint but still
[51:31] it's a marathon so you don't you don't
[51:34] uh you don't take the profits out of
[51:37] Bitcoin that's that's something people
[51:38] should understand as well you don't you
[51:40] don't take the profits Bitcoin is the
[51:43] profit and Bitcoin is the exit you don't
[51:47] you don't trade your Bitcoin to
[51:49] Fiat but that's exactly something that
[51:52] you need to understand and it takes time
[51:55] and it it takes a lot of studying you
[51:57] need to study Bitcoin to understand that
[52:00] and that's also my advice to all the all
[52:03] the friends and family and and the
[52:05] people I meet study Bitcoin it's the
[52:09] best investment of your life if you
[52:10] study Bitcoin yeah and it this this
[52:13] rapid hole never seems to end I'm my
[52:18] yeah my fourth year seriously in the
[52:20] Bitcoin space now uh and I am now
[52:23] interviewing every day a bitcoiner and
[52:25] I'm every I'm learning something new and
[52:28] it's it's it's fascinating for me how
[52:31] how deep this uh Rabbit Hole goes and
[52:33] how different subjects it it it touches
[52:36] and how how great the the the bitcoiners
[52:39] are which leads me to my next question
[52:42] um before we start into the end routine
[52:44] um I'm fascinating I'm fascinated by
[52:48] bitcoiners uh what what they are doing
[52:50] and what uh personalities they are and
[52:54] that's why I introduced a new question
[52:56] that I asked ask every guest now what
[52:58] are you currently passionate about or
[53:00] learning deeply about which is not
[53:02] related to bitcoin like or or besides
[53:05] Bitcoin uh is is there anything that you
[53:07] are currently looking into it you're
[53:10] doing that activity like whatever it is
[53:12] that you're passionate about besides
[53:13] Bitcoin do you have something like
[53:17] that that's a that's a good question you
[53:20] know
[53:22] um I'm I'm really um at the moment I'm
[53:25] actually quite
[53:27] quite into the the whole energy topic
[53:29] you know not talking about electricity
[53:32] but energy as um as human beings and and
[53:36] um how how we all are basically one
[53:39] energy I'm studying that kind of stuff
[53:41] also so it's it's quite quite
[53:43] fascinating you know how do
[53:46] you
[53:48] um kind of feel the um the energy coming
[53:53] from from the other people as well
[53:57] and and you sense you sense if it's if
[53:59] it's a good energy or bad energy and and
[54:01] all the stuff and you can also pass on
[54:03] the good energy to others so that kind
[54:06] of stuff I'm I'm pretty fascinated about
[54:09] kind of energy energy healing stuff you
[54:11] know that's one uh thing that I noticed
[54:13] with the podcast um because to most of
[54:16] my guests I never had
[54:18] contact uh with uh like the only contact
[54:23] I usually have before I record a podcast
[54:25] is the same contact that I have with all
[54:29] the podcast guest is like a small text
[54:32] some of them I called before some of
[54:34] them I already know but like 95% of my
[54:37] guest only texted before so when you
[54:39] come into the uh studio and you record
[54:42] with someone you you feel even through
[54:46] remotely even through recording remotely
[54:49] uh those different kinds of energy that
[54:51] someone brings and there there's this
[54:55] natal Brunell uh energy that I
[54:58] discovered where she's like really very
[55:00] straight and she's giving very uh um
[55:04] distinguished answers and and quick and
[55:07] on the point because she's used to that
[55:09] in the t
[55:10] television and it's a whole different
[55:12] energy for example to Jeff poof who is
[55:15] uh um very um calming and and and makes
[55:21] makes long points and and tries to think
[55:24] through it through it and both are
[55:26] amazing speakers but in a different kind
[55:29] of energy and it's it's it's it's energy
[55:32] is something you can really feel when
[55:34] you are in in a conversation with
[55:37] someone else especially such a focused
[55:40] conversation as as we have it on the on
[55:42] the podcast because there are there's no
[55:44] music in the background we're not eating
[55:46] anything we're not on our phone like
[55:47] there's a really like focused thing and
[55:49] you can feel the energy a lot I love
[55:51] that a lot yes it's amazing and and I
[55:54] think I'm really um I'm jealous to you
[55:57] because you you have a job in Bitcoin
[55:59] and you can do this podcast it's it's
[56:01] it's amazing thing and uh actually one
[56:03] of my dreams to to also be more and more
[56:06] now um within the community to to even
[56:10] you know do something workwise there as
[56:13] well that's that's one of my goals
[56:15] because it's it's an amazing Community
[56:17] Bitcoin Community is is really really
[56:20] amazing and the energy there is is is
[56:22] insanely positive and and I'm looking
[56:25] forward to the to the Bitcoin proc in in
[56:28] just 10 days so it will be awesome it
[56:31] will be awesome uh um yeah I I love
[56:35] Bitcoin PR so much uh I told the story
[56:38] before about this on this podcast I uh
[56:41] just made advertisement for Bitcoin brag
[56:44] without having an a sponsorship or
[56:46] anything because I like the conference
[56:47] just so much and it was one of the
[56:49] reasons why I came into uh Bitcoin uh
[56:53] with a higher commitment like Bitcoin PR
[56:57] made me level up from oh I have it as an
[57:01] investment to yes this this is the thing
[57:04] I want to do with my life right
[57:06] now uh so uh I'm really passionate about
[57:09] people going to the Bitcoin PR
[57:12] conference and for everyone listening
[57:14] that is now because this will come out
[57:17] uh later this this week so it will still
[57:22] be before Bitcoin BR but just a few days
[57:25] before if if if you are still in the
[57:27] decision making like ah should I go to
[57:29] bitcoin brog or not and uh what's what's
[57:31] the decision uh there just do it like if
[57:36] you have the possibilities just go there
[57:40] uh and and and level up in the Bitcoin
[57:42] Community if you can afford uh take the
[57:45] industry pass take maybe even the VIP
[57:47] pass uh learn all those amazing
[57:49] bitcoiners uh and but just being there
[57:53] even if you if you don't even have the
[57:54] conference pass just Expo pa uh pass
[57:58] it's really good and it's it's really
[58:00] affordable uh the Expo pass uh cost I I
[58:03] I don't know the price but it was like
[58:05] really really affordable uh the where
[58:09] you bucks was the the first layer and
[58:12] then uh the industry one was around 600
[58:16] 5 500 something yeah but but there is
[58:19] even I think a lower one in the yeah the
[58:23] okay so that was yes it's for the Expo
[58:25] only okay yeah it's the Bitcoin Expo
[58:29] only and it's
[58:31] 35 right now that okay it's that low and
[58:36] with uh my discount code you get an
[58:39] additional 5% off uh no additional 10%
[58:43] off and when you buy it in Bitcoin you
[58:46] even get additionally 5% off so it's
[58:49] probably than 30 EUR or maybe even under
[58:52] I didn't half so please please don't
[58:56] hate on me if it's a little bit off but
[58:59] uh yeah it's it's
[59:01] definitely a worth and right now there's
[59:04] this buner almost sold out on on the
[59:07] website I hope it's not sold out when
[59:08] this airs uh but uh it's it's it's it's
[59:12] a cheap investment to get to know all
[59:14] the bitcoiners and the Expo if you
[59:17] cannot afford more than that it's it's
[59:19] enough because the conference the the uh
[59:23] the whole uh topics you can listen to
[59:26] afterwards uh and on the Expo you can
[59:29] meet all those great bit Corners yeah
[59:32] the funny funny detail is it's my first
[59:34] Bitcoin conference I've never been to
[59:36] any like major Bitcoin event I've been
[59:39] I've really been in the closet you know
[59:41] I just came out you
[59:42] know right just now this spring so it's
[59:46] my first bigger Bitcoin event I've been
[59:48] to smaller ones yes but U not to these
[59:51] big ones so I'm really looking forward
[59:53] to it and I had a very strong feeling I
[59:55] have to go there
[59:57] it was last year also my first one and
[60:01] it it made me very committed to bitcoin
[60:06] and the Bitcoin community and it showed
[60:09] me that it's not just a internet thing
[60:12] it's it's something real it's something
[60:15] where there actual industry when you go
[60:17] through the Expo and you see all those
[60:19] amazing companies in Bitcoin then you go
[60:22] uh through the conference stage and you
[60:25] see all those exciting people and and
[60:28] it's yeah but uh let's not talk too much
[60:31] about Bitcoin BR I'm already so pumped
[60:33] about it um looking forward to meeting
[60:35] everybody there and it will be it will
[60:37] be amazing um perfect and um then let's
[60:41] come to the end routine of our podcast
[60:43] where the previous guest is asking a
[60:45] question for the next guest without
[60:46] knowing who the next guest actually is
[60:49] and your question uh for from the last
[60:51] guest is if you wake up tomorrow and
[60:54] Bitcoin is at $1 million US dollar per
[60:58] coin what would you do I stack more it's
[61:01] the only right answer
[61:04] right it it's it's the only thing that
[61:07] matters just just stack a little bit
[61:11] more I probably would do one thing
[61:13] different I would uh probably do an
[61:16] special
[61:18] episode but but that that's all I do
[61:21] like it would not change a lot in my
[61:23] daily life honestly may maybe I I had a
[61:26] lot of a lot of a lot of calls and a lot
[61:29] of WhatsApp messages to reply to but uh
[61:33] it it would be a fun day and I would do
[61:36] I would do exactly the same as I do any
[61:39] day just recording and making Bitcoin
[61:42] content and trying to improve Bitcoin
