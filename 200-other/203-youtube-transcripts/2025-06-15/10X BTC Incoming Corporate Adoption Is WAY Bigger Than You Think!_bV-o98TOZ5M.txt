[00:00] we've acquired
[00:02] $3,192 Bitcoin so we own over $300
[00:05] million of Bitcoin we got to do this we
[00:07] got to buy Bitcoin there's no better use
[00:09] of our cash I've been an investor for 25
[00:11] years I meet with CEOs and CFOs all the
[00:14] time now more frequently I ask them
[00:16] Point Blank you know why don't you
[00:18] consider taking all that cash and buying
[00:19] Bitcoin where you see companies start to
[00:21] take some of their cash and buy Bitcoin
[00:23] is the repeal of Sab 121 once that
[00:26] changes which should happen in the next
[00:28] few months I think you actually going to
[00:30] see very big companies taking some cash
[00:33] and buying Bitcoin when Bitcoin is at a
[00:35] million it'll probably have replaced
[00:37] gold as a store of value it'll probably
[00:39] be something that is less volatile when
[00:41] there's a tariff crisis or there's a
[00:43] violence in the Middle East and Bitcoin
[00:45] is the only thing trading on the weekend
[00:47] and it expresses the fears out there
[00:49] that investors have in the markets as
[00:51] they head into the week it may be a
[00:53] different story it may act like gold by
[00:55] them if it's at a million it's probably
[00:57] proven itself enough that all of a
[00:59] sudden it's a place you go to High we
[01:01] started out with a $75 million offering
[01:03] it was multiple times over subscribed
[01:05] and ended up doing raising $100 million
[01:08] at one point we might have been down 25%
[01:11] on our first purchase of Bitcoin had to
[01:13] our board's credit they didn't Flinch
[01:15] they just wanted to buy more fourth
[01:16] quarter that we made a $29 million gain
[01:19] on the Bitcoin we had purchased last
[01:21] [Music]
[01:25] year let's just directly jump into uh
[01:29] what you currently did with the
[01:30] convertible offerings and getting into
[01:32] the top 10 of of of Bitcoin holders as
[01:34] we discussed before we started the
[01:36] recording um but uh maybe before we get
[01:39] uh started with those topics let's just
[01:42] quickly get for the few bitcoiners that
[01:44] still don't know you uh who are you and
[01:47] who is semar scientific and and what are
[01:49] you doing sure I'm the chairman of semar
[01:52] scientific it's public company the
[01:54] ticker is smlr it's been public for
[01:57] almost 10 years and it's a medical
[01:59] device software business and uh about a
[02:02] year ago in May 2024 less than a year
[02:05] ago we decided to adopt a Bitcoin
[02:07] treasury strategy I became chairman
[02:09] about a year and a half ago and
[02:11] spearheaded this plan to to uh adopt
[02:14] Bitcoin as our primary treasury Reserve
[02:17] because I believed in the you know in
[02:18] the long-term value of Bitcoin and uh we
[02:21] were a company much like micro strategy
[02:24] in August of 2020 the way micro strategy
[02:26] was a company public company a zombie
[02:28] company with a lot of cash on its
[02:30] balance sheet we were in a similar
[02:32] situation and decided that what Michael
[02:35] sailor decided to do in August 2020 made
[02:37] a lot of sense for us to do in May of
[02:40] 2024 uh my background is as an investor
[02:43] I've spent my whole career almost my
[02:46] whole career I started off as a
[02:47] journalist worked for the New York Times
[02:49] Moscow news The Oregonian newspaper but
[02:52] and then went on to law school and
[02:54] business school at Harvard and then
[02:55] became an investment banker and then
[02:57] went to work at a hedge fund and started
[02:59] my own hedge fund in 2001 called TCS
[03:02] capital and it was uh it was at one time
[03:05] one of the largest TMT technology and
[03:08] media funds I ran it for about 16 17
[03:11] years before I became a family office
[03:13] which just means I don't have any
[03:14] outside investors but my my I come at
[03:17] this as an investor in the public
[03:19] markets amazing I mean in justtin your
[03:23] background is there are so many
[03:24] interesting things we could go into it
[03:27] not not even talking about Bitcoin
[03:28] that's that's really interesting um so
[03:31] since one and a half years you're
[03:32] chairman did did you start off like
[03:35] already as a as a bitcoiner and you're
[03:37] already like since the start of your
[03:39] chairmanship uh you want to go get more
[03:42] uh get Bitcoin into the company yeah
[03:45] I've always been an investor that
[03:47] believes in kind of um you know
[03:50] investing in Things Early even though
[03:51] I'm a public market investor I'm not a
[03:53] venture capitalist and so I I'm tend to
[03:55] look for things that are small that
[03:57] could get really big and uh Mega friends
[04:00] for example and I've been good at that
[04:01] in my career and kind of spotting those
[04:03] early so Bitcoin was naturally in that
[04:05] world I was I wouldn't call myself a
[04:08] Bitcoin maximalist at all in my years as
[04:11] an investor running TCS but I was always
[04:13] interested in it meeting with companies
[04:15] in the space investing in it and but um
[04:19] not making it kind of my sole Focus uh
[04:21] but I I had a very strong bias and uh
[04:25] and uh real belief in Bitcoin before
[04:29] becoming ch chman of semar scientific to
[04:31] be honest with you I did not expect us
[04:33] to do this when I came on board I I I
[04:36] thought we'd find a medical acquisition
[04:38] that would fit nicely with within our
[04:40] portfolio with all the cash that we had
[04:43] Bitcoin was not on that list of options
[04:46] for use of cash it was really you know
[04:48] BuyBacks Acquisitions and um we just got
[04:53] exhausted by looking at Acquisitions
[04:55] that you know just weren't compelling
[04:57] enough and we just weren't that excited
[04:59] about doing a buyback and as that was
[05:01] happening Michael sailor was
[05:04] broadcasting worldwide how there all
[05:07] these zombie companies that should be
[05:08] taking their cash and buying Bitcoin and
[05:11] it resonated with me especially with you
[05:13] know all the success he's had and my
[05:15] conviction that Bitcoin had a lot of
[05:17] upside I think that was a lot a lot of
[05:19] that was driven more by recent events
[05:21] like the uh institutionalization more
[05:24] institutions buying Bitcoin before the
[05:26] ETF and after the ETF and now with the
[05:28] government
[05:30] like that institutionalization theme is
[05:32] is really what took me to that point
[05:35] where we got to do this we got to buy
[05:37] Bitcoin it's a great investment it could
[05:39] become a great store of value and
[05:41] there's no better use of our
[05:43] cash it's it's amazing because like if
[05:46] if companies have too much cash it's
[05:48] like BuyBacks dividends other
[05:50] Acquisitions that's all of the ideas
[05:52] they have and and it's like why why not
[05:55] Bitcoin I'm always asking like uh there
[05:56] are big companies like apple micros uh
[05:59] Microsoft and all those companies that
[06:01] sit on so much cash and it would be so
[06:03] easy to just like allocate 1% or like 2%
[06:07] to bitcoin it would be zero risk for
[06:09] them because if they lose it all like it
[06:11] wouldn't make any difference at all it's
[06:14] like uh what do you think it's taking
[06:17] them so long is it the processes of a
[06:18] big business um there's a lot of
[06:21] different reasons behind it I mean it's
[06:23] extremely hard for an embedded board
[06:25] that's getting paid nicely to keep the
[06:27] company stable and to not rock the boat
[06:30] to not do something which that they
[06:32] consider risky and volatile like
[06:34] adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheet
[06:37] uh so that that's a good that's a
[06:38] starting point you kind of just need to
[06:40] look at the boards of these companies
[06:42] and you know I've been an investor for
[06:44] 25 years I I meet with CEOs and CFOs all
[06:47] the time and I now more frequently now
[06:51] that semler's pursuing this strategy I
[06:53] ask them Point Blank you know why don't
[06:55] you consider taking all that cash and
[06:56] buying Bitcoin so I meet companies all
[06:58] the time that are like ours you know
[07:00] that have a lot of excess cash and um
[07:03] they they usually just laugh at you they
[07:05] think you're um kidding when you rais
[07:08] the idea it's still you know the Overton
[07:10] window really hasn't shifted for these
[07:13] guys they're still it's still considered
[07:14] kind of a fringe move and you can see
[07:17] that by the fact that there just aren't
[07:18] that many companies actually doing this
[07:21] um I'm I'm not that hopeful I think we
[07:24] were able to do it because our board was
[07:27] was very Co you know cohesive we we our
[07:30] share we own more than 30% of the stock
[07:32] we had we were very aligned with our
[07:34] other shareholders most boards aren't
[07:37] most boards are just people trying to
[07:39] clip a coupon you know collect a check
[07:42] every quarter for signing documents and
[07:44] checking boxes so I think there's a I
[07:47] think our best chance of this changing
[07:50] and doing and where you see companies
[07:52] start to take some of their cash and buy
[07:54] Bitcoin is the repeal of Sab 121 I think
[07:59] that the lack of um really durable
[08:03] custody from major Banks has been a
[08:05] major deterrent I think once that
[08:07] changes which should happen in the next
[08:09] few months I think you were actually
[08:11] going to see uh very big companies
[08:15] taking some cash and buying Bitcoin I
[08:17] think that that's a huge impediment
[08:19] that's being lifted interesting how much
[08:22] is also the the the price developments
[08:25] playing into this is like once the price
[08:28] is like 500,000 or ion is then it it's
[08:31] deemed to be more secure it's deemed to
[08:33] be a bigger market cap is like Bitcoin
[08:35] too small of a thing still for for some
[08:38] big
[08:39] companies um I think I think it's more
[08:42] the custody issue I think what they'll
[08:44] probably say at that point is it's too
[08:45] expensive we missed
[08:47] it so uh but you don't know I don't know
[08:50] maybe that's possible I think it's more
[08:52] the the lack of security and custody
[08:55] that they that they can kind of fall
[08:56] back on as a crutch I think mainly um
[09:00] it's it's a relatively easy argument to
[09:03] make to to to to boards right it's you
[09:07] have this asset class that isn't small I
[09:09] mean if you just take Bitcoin it's about
[09:10] two trillion but all of crypto is bigger
[09:12] but just focusing on bitcoin it's two
[09:14] trillion it has such similar
[09:17] characteristics to gold and it's better
[09:19] than gold because it's digital and
[09:20] decentralized Etc um that it has so much
[09:24] upside relative to the value of gold
[09:27] that that should be Rel relatively easy
[09:30] for people to just understand not
[09:32] necessarily Embrace but they should
[09:35] understand that there's this valuation
[09:36] Gap and they understand gold most people
[09:39] understand that gold is the store of
[09:41] value they can't explain why maybe but
[09:44] uh they most people accept that gold is
[09:46] a store of value and so once that
[09:49] shouldn't be that difficult given the
[09:51] disparity and valuation I think that's
[09:53] what's going to uh also help people
[09:56] convert when it is at a million when
[09:59] coin is at a million it'll it'll
[10:01] probably have replaced gold as a store
[10:03] of value it'll probably be something
[10:05] that is less volatile actually like when
[10:08] when uh you know there's a tariff crisis
[10:10] or there's uh violence in the Middle
[10:12] East and Bitcoin is the only thing
[10:14] trading on the weekend and it expresses
[10:17] the the fears out there that investors
[10:19] have in the markets as they head into
[10:21] the week it may be a different story it
[10:23] may act like gold by then if it's at a
[10:25] million it's probably proven itself
[10:27] enough and institutionalized enough that
[10:30] all of a sudden it's a place you go to
[10:32] hide right it's a place to hide at that
[10:34] point and by then it'll probably be a
[10:36] no-brainer for companies to say oh well
[10:39] this is safe this might be safer than
[10:40] gold because it's portable and it's
[10:43] decentralized and no one controls it ET
[10:46] interesting and and till it comes to
[10:49] that point we probably need big
[10:51] companies that have a unique setting of
[10:55] like there's one two persons in in in
[10:57] charge of the board and one two person
[10:59] maybe maybe like even the meta Facebook
[11:01] that is uh kind of found a lad and that
[11:05] one person has a lot of influence of
[11:07] like where the company's going that's
[11:08] why Tesla is also in like basically just
[11:11] made the decision I mean they have
[11:13] compared to what they can buy almost no
[11:15] Bitcoin I think like 10,000 Bitcoin or
[11:16] something like that uh compared to what
[11:18] they would be able to to do um I would
[11:21] like to jack to is another example of
[11:24] that oh yeah I checked those yeah yeah
[11:27] um let's focus on like uh what are you
[11:29] currently doing with convertible
[11:31] offerings and and basically pushing you
[11:34] to the the top 10 as you said in in the
[11:36] in the companies that hold Bitcoin uh
[11:38] what did you do there and and how is it
[11:40] going so far uh it's going really well
[11:43] uh what happened was we we have been
[11:46] using uh our operating cash flow and to
[11:49] buy Bitcoin which has been pretty solid
[11:52] and then we've also used an ATM an
[11:55] aftermarket offering to sell stock to
[11:57] buy Bitcoin and then we decided to take
[12:00] the next step and put some leverage on
[12:01] our balance sheet to create kind of a
[12:04] levered levered opportunity to own
[12:06] Bitcoin through our these these
[12:09] convertibles uh we did a convertible
[12:11] notes offering at the end of January for
[12:13] $100 million uh and we've used most of
[12:16] the proceeds to buy Bitcoin 88.5 million
[12:19] dollars we used to buy Bitcoin recently
[12:21] announced that um the reason we we we we
[12:24] wanted to tap the convertible Market
[12:26] because it was less deluded to our
[12:28] shares we were able to through a CA call
[12:31] facility we were able to um uh create a
[12:35] conversion price at $17 roughly versus
[12:39] you know over 100% upside uh actually a
[12:41] little less than 100% upside to where
[12:43] our stock was trading uh that day and so
[12:47] um we we we we like that idea of of
[12:50] raising Capital at a you know a very
[12:52] high conversion price uh less delution
[12:56] to where our stock trades and and also
[12:58] to to raise um more Capital than we've
[13:00] raised uh you know in in a than we do
[13:04] you know on a weekly basis using our ATM
[13:06] so it it gave us a really good kind of
[13:09] chunk of capital to buy Bitcoin in a
[13:12] pretty quick way we did it overnight
[13:14] actually it was an overnight offering so
[13:16] there wasn't um a lot of marketing or
[13:19] Preparation ahead of that we did a kind
[13:21] of a blitz with an uh investors who were
[13:24] interested uh we started out with a $75
[13:27] million offering but there was uh it was
[13:30] multiple times oversubscribed so we
[13:32] ended up U increasing the size of the
[13:34] offering and ended up doing raising $1
[13:36] million dollar um pretty quickly um
[13:39] which was great uh and and I I think the
[13:42] bonds have been trading decently and um
[13:45] we are uh just really fired up to to
[13:48] have been able to pull that off and it's
[13:50] senior to our to our equity and it's and
[13:52] it and it's it's debt it's it's so the
[13:54] other important aspect of it is it's
[13:56] five and a half years debt so we we we
[13:59] wanted to tap the debt markets for
[14:02] long-term kind of durable Capital we
[14:04] didn't want to have anything short-term
[14:06] we didn't want the ability for investors
[14:08] to uh to call it or to put it you know
[14:11] back to us and so we we were able to get
[14:14] you know real
[14:15] long-term uh Capital five and a half
[14:19] years um with no put so uh we're really
[14:22] thrilled about that and it it fits in
[14:24] nicely too with the story of our medical
[14:26] business which is um you know has has
[14:29] some really nice green shoots that uh
[14:32] you know we're excited about so um
[14:34] raising long-term debt was was was
[14:37] really a a feather a cap yeah like the
[14:41] the long-term aspect is so important
[14:43] with Bitcoin because it can be very
[14:45] volatile in in the short term uh but
[14:47] like with five years five and a half
[14:49] years you're on a very safe side it's
[14:52] it's like almost risk-free obviously
[14:54] there's no risk- free but that is really
[14:56] really cool um what is actually Going
[14:59] Back to Basics maybe a little bit uh
[15:00] what is the key factor that convinced
[15:03] you and then also the the boards to go
[15:06] not with the traditional rout of
[15:09] BuyBacks and other things and go really
[15:11] hard in in hard into Bitcoin with with
[15:14] that strategy mean adopting the strategy
[15:16] in the first place oh yeah yeah I think
[15:19] it was um I think that it was this
[15:23] frustration of looking at so many
[15:26] Acquisitions and and never feeling that
[15:30] convinced that they were going to work
[15:33] and that they were going to generate
[15:34] great returns for us with our cash we
[15:37] weren't getting any credit for our cash
[15:39] you know our stock was underperforming
[15:41] we were unloved stock and um we we
[15:45] didn't see any acquisition that was
[15:47] going to make people love us anymore
[15:50] than they were unloving us so it made it
[15:53] it really wasn't uh compelling the
[15:56] acquisition side even though we probably
[15:58] spent a year looking at dozens of
[16:00] Acquisitions and getting very close with
[16:02] some the buyback is interesting um I
[16:07] think BuyBacks can make sense at times
[16:09] they're tax efficient but the issue is
[16:12] when you're a small stock and you know
[16:15] you're not getting a lot of attention
[16:16] and you buy shares you're kind of
[16:19] reducing liquidity in your stock which
[16:21] makes it even less attractive for a lot
[16:23] of investors um and sometimes you can't
[16:27] control you know the buyback backs have
[16:29] you know there's a lot of restrictions
[16:31] on when you can buy stock you know if
[16:33] you have inside information as a board
[16:35] you can't you know you have to there you
[16:37] have earnings blackouts so it wasn't
[16:39] it's not it wasn't that efficient or
[16:41] compelling and wasn't going to really
[16:44] give us this kind of step step function
[16:46] improvement in our
[16:49] valuation and so it just wasn't that
[16:52] compelling and when we when we were
[16:56] listening I personally was listening to
[16:57] Michael sailor a lot and kind of just
[17:00] stunned that nobody had really followed
[17:02] in his footsteps and this guy had taken
[17:05] a company like ours you know with a
[17:07] similar profile of a lot of cash making
[17:10] up a lot of its market cap and taking it
[17:12] in only four years to a 100 billion
[17:15] dollar valuation from 500 uh and as I'm
[17:18] an investor following the stock market
[17:20] and a shareholder of his company I like
[17:22] how can you not take notice of that
[17:24] right and so what I did initially was
[17:27] through my friend Tom Lee fun Strat I'm
[17:29] on the board of fun Strat Tom and I are
[17:31] very close and have been for a long time
[17:33] he connected me to to Michael sailor I
[17:35] didn't know Michael personally and um
[17:39] and and Michael was just incredibly
[17:41] gracious and welcoming and led the idea
[17:43] of us pursuing this it was very helpful
[17:45] in kind of just giving us you know tips
[17:48] about how to pursue this you know the
[17:50] the the administrative aspect of it the
[17:52] legal the accounting there's a lot of
[17:54] there's a lot of nuts and bolts that you
[17:56] have to kind of get get figured out
[17:58] before you just go do this and um and
[18:01] and so it was it was it took several
[18:03] weeks but and you know the the idea of
[18:06] going me going to the board and and
[18:07] being able to explain why this made
[18:09] sense I think his his Playbook his
[18:13] example the value that Michael created
[18:16] was real you know obviously had a lot to
[18:18] do with our board uh being biased in
[18:21] favor of doing this and seen his example
[18:24] and seen very clearly how we could
[18:27] somehow pursue a similar strategy and
[18:29] really be the the first company to do
[18:31] that uh after him you know and so uh
[18:35] coincidentally meta plan in Japan was I
[18:38] guess thinking the same way we almost
[18:39] did this simultaneously we didn't know
[18:41] each other but um it's interesting that
[18:43] we we almost like to the day just made
[18:47] this announcement uh and and you know
[18:49] just it's great to see how they're doing
[18:51] but it's it's uh you know it's just
[18:54] interesting that there really I mean
[18:55] there have been some announcements since
[18:57] ours but nobody's really really um uh
[19:01] pursued it in in in the type of scale
[19:05] that that that we have other than micro
[19:07] strategy yeah absolutely that's that's
[19:09] fascinating that that it it took uh a
[19:12] while and I'm still fascinated by like
[19:15] how few companies do that Strat I I I
[19:19] cannot go get over that that and you
[19:22] know I have to give a lot of credit to
[19:24] our board these these were uh people
[19:26] that really didn't know that much about
[19:28] Bitcoin didn't really own Bitcoin um but
[19:31] we're open-minded enough to you know to
[19:34] listen and to to not just to me but to
[19:37] Michael sailor's podcast and to other
[19:39] people we had some um experts on bitcoin
[19:42] come in and and talk to our board about
[19:45] you know educating us on the strategy uh
[19:48] and and they were really uh they they
[19:52] really put in the time they were very uh
[19:55] they became convinced that it made a lot
[19:56] of sense and all since then since May of
[19:59] 24th they have just been full-fledged on
[20:01] board uh never flinched we initially
[20:05] when we bought Bitcoin in May of 24 we
[20:07] bought it pretty in bulk with most of
[20:09] our cash and uh I think to the minute we
[20:13] we we finished buying Bitcoin with like
[20:16] 60 million plus of it all the cash most
[20:18] of the cash on Ballance sheet uh the
[20:21] mount gawk news came out that there was
[20:23] going to be this big distribution and
[20:25] then that sent Bitcoin lower and then
[20:28] the Germans announced they were selling
[20:30] Bitcoin or or started selling Bitcoin
[20:32] that took Bitcoin even lower I think at
[20:34] one point we might have been down
[20:36] 25% on our first purchase of Bitcoin and
[20:40] to our board's credit they just they
[20:42] didn't Flinch they were just they just
[20:44] wanted to buy more and then and we just
[20:46] continued doing that and then we
[20:48] recently announced in uh when we
[20:49] released uh preliminary numbers for the
[20:52] fourth quarter that we made a $29
[20:54] million gain on the Bitcoin we had
[20:56] purchased last year so uh that's
[20:59] significant when you have you know 9
[21:01] million shares and and you make you know
[21:04] close to $30 million and a quarter um
[21:07] it's it's it's
[21:08] profound yeah it seems to be like
[21:11] there's this education Gap like once you
[21:13] close the education Gap to bitcoin the
[21:16] only question in your mind is like how
[21:17] do I get more Bitcoin like how do I get
[21:19] even even more and then you get creative
[21:22] and I'm amazed what micro strategy is
[21:24] doing and I I have a hard time figuring
[21:27] out all the things how he comes from
[21:29] like a 500 million cash balance to like
[21:32] making 42 billion offerings like my my
[21:35] mind cannot comprehend that yeah um but
[21:37] it also has paid off really well for for
[21:40] for your company may maybe uh to give
[21:42] the the people a little bit more of a CR
[21:44] of like how well it has been already
[21:47] playing uh for similar scientific um how
[21:50] many Bitcoin have you acquired what is
[21:52] kind of the the the upside on that and
[21:54] what has it done to to your company yeah
[21:57] sure so we've acquired uh We've
[22:00] announced
[22:02] 3,192 Bitcoin purchases so we own over a
[22:05] little over $300 million of Bitcoin as
[22:08] we're speaking now um and um we still
[22:12] have a little bit of cash on our balance
[22:14] sheeet for working capital in our
[22:16] business um and our business is
[22:18] generating a few million dollars of
[22:21] operating cash flow ACC quarter we
[22:23] announced I think a preliminary number
[22:25] of three 3.4 to 3.7 million of cash flow
[22:28] this this quarter and we'll use that to
[22:30] buy more Bitcoin um we also um we we we
[22:34] unlocked some value uh we announced that
[22:37] we sold a minority investment uh in a in
[22:40] a we made an investment in a uh in a
[22:43] medical business called Monarch Medical
[22:45] and we sold a piece of our stake in that
[22:48] um and collected a few million dollars
[22:50] which we used to buy more Bitcoin so um
[22:54] we we generated a I think we've
[22:56] generated like 150%
[22:58] Bitcoin yield since we started uh this
[23:02] process last year um and and so we're we
[23:06] you know we're fully committed to it uh
[23:09] in terms of just generating more Bitcoin
[23:11] yield and high Bitcoin yield and you
[23:14] making our our our Bitcoin story even
[23:16] bigger and and and and you know
[23:18] hopefully you know it'll we're going to
[23:21] really go go nuts in terms of Bitcoin I
[23:24] believe strongly in the uh in the upside
[23:26] of
[23:27] this this come
[23:29] on really interes what but uh for the
[23:32] for the people that maybe never heard
[23:34] Bitcoin yield because like people uh
[23:36] confuse I think the the term yield in
[23:38] Bitcoin uh because like there is no
[23:41] yield Bitcoin but there's a Bitcoin
[23:44] yield now what is a Bitcoin yield at the
[23:47] metric well I just I think of I think of
[23:50] Bitcoin yield as just um how how good
[23:53] are we at creatively buying Bitcoin and
[23:57] meaning how how are we adding value to
[24:00] our to our to our Equity by buying
[24:03] Bitcoin and um and how are we buying it
[24:06] in a way that's creative to our
[24:08] shareholders so the that's how that's
[24:10] how I think about it so it's basically
[24:13] of like uh how effective are you in
[24:16] getting more Bitcoin with your financial
[24:19] uh games that that that you're playing
[24:21] basically that is a really good magic
[24:24] could is that I'm I'm looking forward to
[24:27] like when more people figured it out and
[24:30] more companies figured it out how the
[24:32] financial side of things work is is the
[24:35] single most interesting uh metric maybe
[24:38] Bitcoin per share or like how many
[24:41] Bitcoin you can accumulate per year more
[24:44] than than last year how do you think the
[24:46] the the impact of Bitcoin long term will
[24:48] be on the financial markets
[24:51] overall um I in terms of I think I think
[24:56] what's going to end up happening is
[24:58] that um the Val the I think I like I
[25:02] said earlier the repeal of sabb 121 I
[25:05] think has this kind of um
[25:08] underestimated uh positive impact
[25:11] institutionally on bitcoin so I think
[25:13] that once uh there's clear uh
[25:18] Improvement in custody and that we have
[25:22] major uh highly capitalized banks around
[25:25] the world like the JP Morgans the bank
[25:27] America the ubs's customing Bitcoin I
[25:31] think that's going to have a massive
[25:34] institutional uh uh impact positive
[25:36] impact on bitcoin prices and I don't I
[25:39] think it's difficult to time that
[25:41] because it's not it's not implemented
[25:43] yet but it was just it was just
[25:45] basically Sab 121 was just repealed so
[25:48] it'll take a little bit of time for
[25:49] banks to to gear up for this but once it
[25:52] starts happening I think that there's
[25:55] this um like this this hyper
[25:59] institutionalization of Bitcoin which
[26:01] will I I think have a massive impact on
[26:04] institutional demand to own
[26:07] Bitcoin interesting that that's really
[26:09] good um what what I'm also want to get
[26:12] at is like on an individual level if if
[26:15] you adopt Bitcoin and I know because I'm
[26:18] already I'm actually getting most of my
[26:20] income now paid in Bitcoin and I'm in
[26:22] the situation where I just have to
[26:25] either borrow against my Bitcoin or
[26:27] spend my Bitcoin and I really don't want
[26:29] to spend my Bitcoin like I I really
[26:31] never want to get into my Bitcoin uh but
[26:34] if I have fear laying around I I'm more
[26:37] like a let's let's spend it like let's
[26:39] let's put it somewhere it it it does
[26:41] some weird things with with your mind um
[26:44] maybe the the question is more like what
[26:47] does it do when when companies get more
[26:49] and more into Bitcoin the same thing as
[26:51] like an individual getting more cautious
[26:53] with like spending anything else except
[26:55] of Bitcoin now one aspect you already
[26:57] mentioned you so
[26:59] shares in other companies and you
[27:01] already bought Bitcoin with that I get
[27:03] what you're saying okay so what how does
[27:05] the how does the corporate mindset kind
[27:07] of how is it how is it impacted once
[27:09] it's kind of uh indoctrinated by Bitcoin
[27:13] yeah exactly yeah so that's a really
[27:16] interesting question um I think um I I
[27:20] think it has a similar impact as it does
[27:22] on an individual I think like you know
[27:24] you you once you become a Believer you
[27:27] you get very highly convicted and you do
[27:29] want to own more of it because you see
[27:32] its potential and and as a board you are
[27:36] you're looking for pennies on the ground
[27:37] you know you want to you want to you
[27:39] want to find whatever you know scraps
[27:42] coins bills whatever there is out there
[27:45] to buy Bitcoin you you wanna you want to
[27:47] buy it and um you do want to do it
[27:50] though in an intelligent measured way
[27:53] more I'd say than you would as an
[27:54] individual maybe maybe not I but I we
[27:57] think we have a very methodical way
[27:59] about buying Bitcoin we we think about
[28:02] where our stock price is trading versus
[28:05] the price of Bitcoin we we track that
[28:07] closely and we think about the valuation
[28:10] obviously of our business versus you
[28:12] know our Bitcoin Holdings so we're we're
[28:14] we're thinking about those things and I
[28:17] I'd say that most of the time we feel
[28:19] really great about that and being able
[28:22] to buy Bitcoin with our cash um you know
[28:26] there there there obviously could be
[28:28] dislocations where your stock price is
[28:30] trading at a discount to your Bitcoin
[28:32] Holdings and you don't want to sell your
[28:34] stock and you know that there there are
[28:36] there there could be hypothetical
[28:38] scenarios like that but you know we
[28:40] don't expect that to happen and um but
[28:43] we're but we're we're we're we're
[28:45] methodical enough because we have kind
[28:47] of a plan in place for how we think
[28:49] about where we should be buying Bitcoin
[28:52] where we should be selling our stock to
[28:53] buy Bitcoin or where you know where
[28:55] where where it's a creative right where
[28:57] we can create this Bitcoin this you know
[29:00] High Bitcoin yield by doing that and so
[29:04] um so we look at that closely but we are
[29:07] kind of propelled by this this this
[29:09] conviction that we want to own as much
[29:11] as we can um that that this is a really
[29:14] great price to buy Bitcoin because of it
[29:17] a lot of reasons but I'd say the main
[29:20] one for me is just it's it's its
[29:22] potential to replace gold and that it's
[29:25] has us you know it's trading at such a
[29:27] massive discount to Gold I partnered up
[29:31] with coin vigilante this is the most
[29:34] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[29:37] saw created by anyone look at that
[29:39] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:42] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[29:45] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[29:48] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:51] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[29:55] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[29:57] new an amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:01] watch collections you have the date of
[30:03] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:07] there and of course also the block
[30:09] height and which EPO we are currently in
[30:12] I love the level of detail they put in
[30:15] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[30:18] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:20] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[30:23] love those watches so so much if you
[30:26] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[30:28] regular basis I'll guess you already
[30:30] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[30:33] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[30:36] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[30:39] personal recommendation for Hardware
[30:40] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[30:43] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[30:46] gift for a friend who has still the
[30:48] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[30:51] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[30:54] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss Robin to
[30:58] get your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:01] really level up your sovereignty as an
[31:04] individual you have to have the most
[31:06] secure self- custody setup you have to
[31:09] secure your own devices you have to
[31:11] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:14] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:17] where you live you even want to have a
[31:19] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:22] in case something goes really really
[31:24] wrong and through all those steps the
[31:26] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[31:31] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[31:35] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[31:38] how you can level up your sovereignty
[31:41] yeah it's it's super interesting also
[31:43] even if you look at the uh extending
[31:46] life of of the company when once you
[31:49] have an asset that uh gets more in
[31:51] purchasing power and and you don't have
[31:53] to uh look into like what it's doing
[31:57] because if you buy a company the
[31:59] management team can uh go in the wrong
[32:01] direction something like that with with
[32:04] Bitcoin it kind of uh when I had sale on
[32:07] the podcast he kind of went into this
[32:09] topic of like if you want to make your
[32:11] company Immortal you buy Bitcoin and you
[32:15] hold it there and it could make uh your
[32:17] company go Immortal and extend the life
[32:20] extremely extremely long I love the
[32:23] concept of like having Bitcoin as the
[32:25] core of the business and then feeding
[32:27] from that and and investing in in very
[32:29] intelligent moves and moving the company
[32:31] forward that's that's super interesting
[32:33] what impacts Bitcoin will have on the
[32:35] companies yeah you know it's interesting
[32:38] um we do have a kind of a varied story
[32:42] in that regard because we we do have
[32:45] this medical business and um we we have
[32:49] a product called Quan flow that uh
[32:51] before we adopted the Bitcoin treasury
[32:53] strategy our stock went from a dollar a
[32:55] share to $150 a share in over a two or
[32:59] three year period um because this
[33:02] product was so Dynamic and so beloved by
[33:04] our customers who are the large uh
[33:07] Health Care insurance companies and um
[33:10] they made you know billions of dollars
[33:12] off of this product of ours and it it's
[33:14] it's just uh it's simple easy to use
[33:17] device to measure people for vascular
[33:19] diseases and this product um has super
[33:23] high margins too so so we we generated
[33:26] tremendous cash flow and we can continue
[33:28] to do that uh we're we're looking at uh
[33:31] other products with the same device
[33:33] we're hoping for FDA approval soon you
[33:36] know this year hopefully um and and that
[33:40] uh will enable us to kind of have this
[33:42] this feeder into our Bitcoin treasury
[33:44] strategy so we we believe that we have
[33:48] this uh this great customer base that
[33:50] loves our products that we don't doesn't
[33:53] require us to put in a lot of capex to
[33:56] to Fe to to fuel
[33:58] and therefore you know we have kind of a
[34:00] great flywheel where we can organically
[34:02] generate free cash flow that feeds into
[34:05] our Bitcoin treasury strategy and
[34:07] hopefully you know we'll have a product
[34:09] like uh like our one for peripheral
[34:12] artery disease that will um be able to
[34:15] kind of generate that that type of uh
[34:18] those type of returns that it created
[34:20] before um the um that that product uh
[34:25] when at its peak our stock had a billion
[34:27] dollar valuation just on that one
[34:29] product I love that it it uh it it it
[34:32] leted me think about uh Bitcoin
[34:34] companies you as kind of like a Bitcoin
[34:38] flywheel you you have that Bitcoin
[34:41] treasury plus you have companies on top
[34:43] of that that generate uh have an
[34:45] operating business uh and they have
[34:48] unique opportunities to put uh on uh
[34:52] debt offerings Bond offerings which they
[34:55] can uh basically put uh the the the
[34:58] Bitcoin they would have bought maybe in
[35:00] a year already now which makes a huge
[35:03] difference uh which makes products like
[35:05] an ETF that bundles Bitcoin companies
[35:08] together really interesting to think
[35:10] about like there's like in the
[35:12] diversification of like different
[35:13] companies and there's like the hopefully
[35:16] an an outpace of Bitcoin in there it's
[35:17] almost like a Bitcoin leverage if if you
[35:20] want to buy something like that it's
[35:22] super interesting to think about those
[35:23] things and then as a contrast to other
[35:26] things yeah you as we went through that
[35:29] acquisition process looking for medical
[35:31] Acquisitions before we adopted the
[35:33] treasury strategy we it was valuable
[35:37] because we kind we realized that we
[35:38] could probably do a lot of things
[35:41] internally that we were looking at and
[35:44] that we should explore those ideas and
[35:46] just and just do them organically
[35:48] because we have this great customer base
[35:50] this great Healthcare customer base that
[35:53] we can feed products into they like us
[35:55] you know we've done well for them and so
[35:57] why not just try to to feed them things
[36:01] that you know that don't require a lot
[36:02] of investment and that will hopefully
[36:05] generate High margins that you know then
[36:07] allow us to buy more Bitcoin interesting
[36:11] um have you already implemented or maybe
[36:14] looking into implementing uh other
[36:16] things along with Bitcoin like running a
[36:19] a full node like investing in mining or
[36:22] like paying bonuses in Bitcoin or
[36:24] anything like uh touching Bitcoin
[36:26] outside of using it as a treasury asset
[36:30] no no I I think that um we're not really
[36:34] interested in in anything like that I
[36:36] think what we're interested in is just
[36:38] owning as much Bitcoin as we possibly
[36:40] can um there I know people ask me a lot
[36:43] would you loan it out and so forth but
[36:45] we're not we're looking really for
[36:47] long-term you know Capital we're not
[36:50] looking to be Mark to Market having the
[36:53] the cudes of you know the the volatility
[36:56] I guess of uh of of loaning Bitcoin out
[36:58] and having to worry about the mark to
[37:01] Market we're not we're not going to get
[37:02] into that game um in terms of like
[37:05] Bitcoin businesses outside of this no I
[37:08] think we just want it to be you know all
[37:11] about owning Bitcoin and and and and
[37:14] continuing to have a um you know a lot
[37:16] of optionality in our health care
[37:18] business and you know if we can get
[37:20] these FDA approval for a product for
[37:23] heart dysfunction it's called um not
[37:25] we're we don't know the timing of it but
[37:28] we're we're waiting for the FDA to to
[37:30] get back to us on it uh then you know
[37:33] that could open up just a a huge
[37:35] opportunity for us that will just uh you
[37:39] I think uh really really jump start uh
[37:42] more Bitcoin P purchases I love that
[37:45] yeah like uh it's um you you kind of as
[37:49] a bitcoiner you cheer for other
[37:50] bitcoiners uh because you're all working
[37:52] on the same thing as like if you're
[37:55] doing good it's good for me if I'm
[37:58] it's good for you like this kind of like
[38:00] it's it's an amazing thing that brings
[38:04] us together when I I was listening to
[38:06] Elon Musk um Ernie's call the other
[38:09] night and um he was talking about um his
[38:12] business and the Outlook and and he was
[38:16] saying how this year you know 25 is
[38:19] going to be an okay year because they
[38:21] they're kind of in a transitional year
[38:23] but 26 he said it's going to be
[38:25] ridiculously good and I think 27's going
[38:28] to be even more ridiculously good and
[38:30] it's funny I kind of look at our
[38:32] business like that like this is the year
[38:33] we're hoping to hear from the FDA and um
[38:37] and then if they you know if we can get
[38:39] a positive um uh you know reception from
[38:42] the FDA then I think you know 26 27 like
[38:46] and and it and and it's great because we
[38:48] have this you know we have this
[38:49] long-term structured balance sheet that
[38:52] enables us to to take advantage of that
[38:55] Runway we touched on it uh a little a
[38:57] little bit before uh when we talked
[38:59] about like how how future companies
[39:01] might come to to to bitcoin like
[39:04] companies that are already existing but
[39:05] uh companies that then adopt Bitcoin um
[39:09] you mentioned the the Sab 21 uh uh 21 um
[39:13] repeal that that is really really
[39:15] important are there any other Milestones
[39:18] that you're looking at like what could
[39:20] trigger more more companies to come uh
[39:23] into Bitcoin and and the kind of the the
[39:25] thinking behind those those companies
[39:28] and those boards to come into Bitcoin
[39:30] and like play play in our game well I I
[39:34] do think the government support if if
[39:38] these executive orders pan out where the
[39:40] government's you know buying Bitcoin uh
[39:43] I think that should have a big influence
[39:45] on corporations and and probably get
[39:48] some of the larger ones to follow suit
[39:52] um I I I think also something that
[39:55] really could come out of this is is just
[39:57] more um countries buying Bitcoin right
[40:00] like bigger countries which I think in
[40:02] some ways is more powerful um because
[40:05] then you know these guys have uh huge
[40:08] reserves to buy Bitcoin and um and and
[40:12] uh then it be you know there's so many
[40:13] countries in the world and there's so
[40:15] many countries that really need to own
[40:16] Bitcoin right the US is probably low on
[40:19] the list of those there's so many
[40:21] countries that are that would benefit so
[40:24] much from owning Bitcoin to solve a lot
[40:26] of their inflation issues the debasement
[40:29] of their currencies and um and so I
[40:33] think that could be a catalyst more than
[40:35] anything you know more than a uh than
[40:38] companies individual companies buying
[40:40] Bitcoin absolutely yeah they have almost
[40:42] unlimited amount of funny if they if
[40:45] they print it how shocked were you when
[40:47] you heard about Trump embracing it and
[40:50] all the things it it came really quickly
[40:52] for me me too I I was in Nashville uh
[40:56] when he gave that speech was there and
[40:58] um I was blown away I just I couldn't
[41:00] believe it um I I uh I am especially
[41:05] just uh Blown Away by the support in the
[41:08] Senate and and I guess in Congress
[41:11] generally but Senator lumus Senator
[41:13] Scott Senator Blackburn Senator heger I
[41:16] mean they're they're they're leading a
[41:18] charge you know and that's really
[41:21] important I think a lot of people don't
[41:22] appreciate that a lot of people think oh
[41:24] you know it's president Trump he's
[41:26] filling campaign promise
[41:27] and so forth and does he really believe
[41:30] in Bitcoin or is he into other crypto
[41:32] hard to know but the underlying L
[41:36] legislative uh activity below him is is
[41:40] strong and these are leaders of
[41:42] committees who are acting you know
[41:44] swiftly to put out legislation working
[41:47] hard with the Democrats to to come come
[41:51] up with really powerful uh acts of
[41:55] Congress um and I think president Trump
[41:58] will support those it's not going to
[42:00] veto those and so there's just there's
[42:02] so many layers of activity that really
[42:05] um are are driving this yeah it's kind
[42:08] of hard to stay levelheaded and not be
[42:12] too polish on bitcoin if like the we
[42:14] talked about corporate level now we have
[42:16] the national level always the individual
[42:19] level is kind of untapped if you see the
[42:21] Google Trends and all the things it
[42:23] seems like retail investors are far away
[42:26] from really entering in a big way so it
[42:29] it we have all the play all the things
[42:32] in place for a massive Bull Run and we
[42:35] already around 100K so that it's uh it's
[42:38] kind of uh amazing for me to see where
[42:41] where this could lead us to the next
[42:43] couple of uh months or maybe like years
[42:46] uh to come really really impressive to
[42:48] to see is is that the is maybe the the
[42:52] America uh playing with that idea now
[42:55] the official Game Theory race for
[42:59] National strategic Bitcoin Reserve I
[43:01] think so I I do believe that absolutely
[43:05] that will be really uh fun to see um I
[43:09] want to get uh one other thing into the
[43:11] podcast before we kind of drift office
[43:14] um from from great people that did a lot
[43:17] in in in in life and and you explained
[43:20] your background a little bit in the
[43:22] starting I think we can learn a lot from
[43:24] from each other uh I W to uh kind of get
[43:27] get like uh how you came to be so
[43:30] successful with the company how how you
[43:32] came up uh not the story but more of
[43:34] like okay what did you learn along the
[43:37] way what was really important for you uh
[43:39] and and I'm asking that um because it's
[43:43] it's really important I think for
[43:45] bitcoiners to have an um to have
[43:48] something outside of Bitcoin we get so
[43:50] passionate about Bitcoin that we kind of
[43:52] forget everything else and and then and
[43:55] we we we should get things outside of
[43:57] Bitcoin so I'm also trying as a Bitcoin
[44:00] podcast host to get outside of Bitcoin
[44:02] things into the podcast so I think uh
[44:04] with you we can learn a lot so maybe
[44:06] there is one or two things you can share
[44:09] yeah I I think um I was fortunate to
[44:13] grow up uh in Oregon which is um a
[44:16] unique place where people think
[44:19] differently and um I had parents who
[44:22] were like that they were entrepreneurs
[44:25] who were often thinking outside the box
[44:27] my father who started similar scientific
[44:29] uh invented all kinds of devices
[44:31] throughout his life so I was always kind
[44:34] of uh and you know he at times he would
[44:36] get into Transcendental Meditation and
[44:39] Buddhism and um he was always just
[44:42] thinking outside the box and that had a
[44:44] big big influence on me it kind of made
[44:45] me think that you know anything's
[44:47] possible that you should you know you
[44:49] shouldn't be afraid to pursue whatever
[44:52] you think makes sense uh and so that
[44:55] that's always um that ability to kind of
[44:57] think outside the boxes is always kind
[44:59] of helped me as an investor like and
[45:02] that's probably partially how I you know
[45:05] discovered that Bitcoin had this
[45:07] potential you know as a as a great
[45:09] investment I've also um I've also just
[45:12] uh really felt it was important to give
[45:15] back um you know and to you to pay it
[45:17] forward I spent I spent a lot of my
[45:21] adult life coaching and uh helping um
[45:24] underprivileged kids get into college
[45:27] through baseball so I I I love baseball
[45:30] today I played baseball high school and
[45:32] college and um you know uh it's always
[45:36] been kind of an important part of my
[45:37] life and uh I I I live in the Bronx and
[45:41] I started an academy to help uh a lot of
[45:44] underserved kids in the Bronx get
[45:47] college baseball scholarships uh I I
[45:49] coach the kids I started working with
[45:51] them when they were seven or eight years
[45:53] old with other coaches and we had a you
[45:56] know very um major program that I think
[45:59] we must have helped 150 200 kids get
[46:02] college baseball scholarships and become
[46:04] for most of them the first in their
[46:05] families to go to college so I've always
[46:07] had this kind of um desire to help
[46:10] people and and I I I was able to do it
[46:13] in a Hands-On way through my love for
[46:15] baseball my uh and wanting to help uh a
[46:18] lot of the community around me um
[46:21] succeed and get a shot in life um it
[46:24] started when um I uh was coaching little
[46:28] league and and and I just saw a lot of a
[46:31] lot of racism a lot of our players were
[46:33] Dominican or an
[46:36] African-American uh and I um and when we
[46:40] go play in other parts of the country
[46:42] and and we would you hear direct insults
[46:45] about our you know the kids would listen
[46:47] to this when they were 10 years old we
[46:48] were on a field once in New Jersey and
[46:51] um we were in a really tight game in the
[46:53] championship these kids are 10 years old
[46:55] and they're on the field and the parents
[46:57] on the other team from uh Suburban New
[47:00] Jersey where most of the know kids I
[47:03] think all the kids were white and the
[47:04] parents were white started singing the
[47:06] National Anthem and you know and these
[47:08] kids were all all our players were
[47:09] American citizens you know but they were
[47:12] Dominican or black and and and you know
[47:14] to see the the look on their faces you
[47:17] know when their opponents were singing
[47:18] the National Anthem was really scary and
[47:22] and and singing USA I should say they
[47:24] were as as as the game was getting
[47:26] Tighter and Tighter they would be
[47:27] screaming USA you know and it became
[47:30] like the USA versus the Dominican
[47:32] Republic it it was it was awful and so
[47:35] um and so then you know as as the years
[47:38] went on we just encountered more of that
[47:40] we would go to tournaments in high
[47:42] school down in like Georgia and Florida
[47:46] and coaches college coaches wouldn't
[47:48] even recruit our players because they
[47:49] assumed they weren't smart enough or
[47:51] didn't have the grades to get into uh
[47:53] into into their universities so we
[47:56] started tutoring uh a lot of our players
[47:59] in the SAT at that time it was required
[48:01] and we helped them you know improve
[48:03] their SAT scores and um we ended up
[48:06] getting a lot of these kids into college
[48:08] through through kind of edu helping them
[48:10] with education and helping them get
[48:12] better as baseball players and that's
[48:14] something I'm just I'm really proud of
[48:16] and I spent
[48:17] probably 15 years of my life you know
[48:20] every summer on the baseball field
[48:22] talking to you know coaching these kids
[48:25] talking to college baseball coaches
[48:27] trying to help these kids get recruited
[48:29] so it's a big part of my life I I love
[48:32] that do you think that Bitcoin might
[48:36] play a role in connecting the world
[48:38] further in eliminating those
[48:41] artificial uh borders between us with
[48:44] like eliminating many currencies and and
[48:47] stuff like that do you think that that
[48:48] could play a role in that it it really
[48:51] can't it's hard for me to grasp that
[48:53] because um I I haven't exper I haven't
[48:56] traveled enough to foreign countries to
[48:58] talk about Bitcoin and understand the
[49:00] impact it has but from um from from from
[49:04] from listening to people like Jack MERS
[49:06] and and and hearing those stories
[49:09] absolutely it's incredible to me it's
[49:11] what the impact it can have and uh you
[49:14] know and and liberate people and give
[49:16] them a shot at U having a happy life
[49:19] absolutely I think you know at the end
[49:21] of the day that's probably the most
[49:22] important aspect of Bitcoin absolutely I
[49:25] really interesting I I forgot uh the
[49:27] name I'm trying to think of her but uh I
[49:30] recently had an African woman on and she
[49:33] told how Bitcoin gave her the chance to
[49:36] finally have finances that doesn't
[49:38] require her husband her ex former
[49:41] husband to sign because it's it's common
[49:44] that uh the woman can only use the bank
[49:47] account if the man signs on that which
[49:51] as someone that lives now in Austria
[49:53] whole his life is is completely out of
[49:55] this world that is even existing but it
[49:57] is existing uh and I think in the
[49:59] Western countries sometimes we are uh
[50:02] very fortunate with our positions uh
[50:04] when we then look at other countries we
[50:06] like oh like there are completely
[50:07] different set of problems uh that you
[50:10] couldn't even think about so uh I'm I'm
[50:14] only getting um irritated when I hear uh
[50:17] people saying oh like Bitcoin has no use
[50:19] cases it's just for rich people I'm like
[50:21] no like it's it's exactly the opposite
[50:23] yes rich people use it because they are
[50:25] smart uh but it's not uh for for that so
[50:28] I'm really liking to get this aspect of
[50:31] Bitcoin as much as possible on the
[50:32] podcast because it's really important to
[50:34] talk about obviously we also like when
[50:36] the numbers going up but uh the freedom
[50:39] and the inclusivity of Bitcoin is is
[50:41] probably the most more important part
[50:43] there as you said yeah that's really
[50:44] inspiring and is an area where I would
[50:46] love to understand and help more ah
[50:49] really cool perfect thank you so much uh
[50:52] Eric already um before uh we have one
[50:55] more end team of the podcast where the
[50:58] previous guest is asking a question for
[50:59] the next guest without knowing who the
[51:01] next guest actually is and the question
[51:03] is from the previous guest is what will
[51:06] the world look like because of Bitcoin
[51:08] in 50 years well I I think for sure
[51:12] Bitcoin will be digital gold and so it
[51:15] will become it will it will be bigger
[51:17] than and play the role as the store of
[51:20] value and Safe Haven in the world uh to
[51:23] hopefully uh save whatever uh dbased
[51:27] currencies are still around but I
[51:29] believe that it will become the the the
[51:33] standard for currency and for most of
[51:37] the people in the world really really
