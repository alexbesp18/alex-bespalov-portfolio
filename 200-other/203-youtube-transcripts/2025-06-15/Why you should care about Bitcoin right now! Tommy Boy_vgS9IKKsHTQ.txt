[00:00] around us are becoming poor every day
[00:02] your friends and family the people you
[00:03] love if you're not telling them about
[00:05] Bitcoin why even though it's not related
[00:07] to sex it just gives you joy and
[00:09] pleasure if you go around and ask 100
[00:11] people anything about Bitcoin and you'll
[00:13] realize that we are sober they're
[00:15] actually spamming our Network right now
[00:17] how is this different from slavery it's
[00:20] not actually live in an open air prison
[00:22] right we're still slaves the only chains
[00:25] that we wear now
[00:27] are what what drove you to be uh so into
[00:32] Bitcoin that you even tell other people
[00:34] on social platforms about
[00:37] it uh yeah not even just social
[00:40] platforms uh I try and naturally bring
[00:44] up Bitcoin organically and in even in
[00:46] personto person
[00:48] interactions uh I've always tended to
[00:51] kind of be the person uh in my group or
[00:54] my family that seeks out what's good and
[00:58] what uh could help
[01:00] and I've spent I can if I could count
[01:04] it's probably a couple hundred hours
[01:05] listening to podcasts uh even reading
[01:08] books like I've read the Bitcoin
[01:10] standard uh most books you know the top
[01:13] 10 I've put them uh in my audio book
[01:16] list and I I usually generally listen to
[01:18] books because I have a one hour ride to
[01:19] work so it's perfect and I just I just
[01:22] see Bitcoin as the arc it is the boat
[01:27] that is going to take us out of the
[01:29] chaos that we're all in right now and
[01:32] and to me it seems like nobody is really
[01:34] paying attention uh nobody notices there
[01:37] they're they're all a short time uh
[01:40] frame people and and they're out there
[01:43] spending and and whatnot so I'm I really
[01:46] I just have something in my soul that
[01:48] that that I find it just urges me is
[01:51] always pushing me to help people even
[01:53] even people that resist me like I have
[01:55] an aunt that is like she's wealthy uh
[01:58] and she has wants nothing to do with
[02:00] Bitcoin and she's told me that and I
[02:02] still even this morning I I text her um
[02:06] the actually I text her the commercial
[02:08] you just posted on Twitter uh the
[02:10] thejournal uh the commercial for the bit
[02:14] ETF yeah the bit guns SPF from bitwise
[02:18] it is it's uh it's going czy wild yeah I
[02:22] I sent that right too I said hey look
[02:24] you know it's becoming kind of big and
[02:27] and she she's I guarantee going to
[02:30] reject it she's going to you know say
[02:31] something but there's something inside
[02:33] me that just needs to try and help
[02:35] people I I I wish I could pinpoint it
[02:37] and sometimes I wish I could actually
[02:38] turn it down because it kind of gets in
[02:41] the way of of regular like you know just
[02:43] talking to people I find like I'm always
[02:45] thinking how can I slide Bitcoin into
[02:48] this conversation and maybe I need to
[02:50] learn I'm trying to learn how to dial
[02:52] that back you know figure the right
[02:55] balance you also um made a presentation
[03:00] on what is bitcoin for normis what you
[03:04] wrote me I
[03:05] think is that from your learnings
[03:08] talking to everybody and trying to to
[03:12] Orange build them what were your like
[03:14] what your biggest learnings from that
[03:17] what what can you give what's the main
[03:19] message you want to give newes for
[03:22] Bitcoin uh I try like when I first start
[03:25] talking to with it's a PDF format and I
[03:28] want to I want to go around Al and have
[03:31] seminars and and just an hourong kind of
[03:33] seminar and the the PDF that I create is
[03:36] it's what is bitcoin and it quickly
[03:39] within 16 Pages I'm trying to just get
[03:42] people's minds uh uncondition start
[03:46] breaking the the the bondage that
[03:48] they're under of this Fiat system and
[03:50] how how they think there's no
[03:51] alternative I like these people out here
[03:54] in Normy land they don't even realize
[03:56] that there is an alternate system that
[03:58] they can opt into and it's it's free so
[04:02] it's I'm trying to just get people's
[04:06] wheel spinning because if if I ask a
[04:08] hundred people I bet you maybe five of
[04:11] them even have heard of Bitcoin and and
[04:14] any of them the five that have heard
[04:16] it's all price action stuff it's like oh
[04:18] it's going to it's going to collapse
[04:20] it's going to go up it's going to
[04:20] collapse but price action is one of the
[04:23] things that I I like to look at least
[04:25] like I check the price quite a bit but
[04:27] uh that's just my OCD but to me the the
[04:31] Bitcoin is more of a like I said like
[04:33] it's the arc that we all need to get on
[04:34] to to get us out of this mess right a
[04:37] decentralized ledger that anybody can
[04:39] partake in you know some of us in this
[04:42] I'm in a first world country I'm I'm in
[04:44] Canada so I I don't I'm not subjected to
[04:46] some of these things that third world
[04:47] countries go through and I try and open
[04:50] people's eyes to that uh that you know
[04:52] we're very fortunate that we can have a
[04:54] bank account that our our currency is
[04:56] inflating at like you know last year
[04:58] last few years have been pretty rough
[04:59] off um but there's countries out there
[05:01] that it's inflating at like 200% a year
[05:04] Lebanon they woke up one morning and the
[05:06] bank literally emailed them and told
[05:08] them that their money was going to get
[05:09] cut in half if you had spent your whole
[05:11] life saving $100,000 you wake up January
[05:14] 2nd and your $100,000 was $50,000 and
[05:16] there was nothing you could do about it
[05:18] could you imagine being part of that
[05:20] like I I try and uh emulate and think
[05:24] about how that would feel and that's I
[05:26] think maybe the fuel I use because I
[05:29] know it's coming here it is it's just a
[05:31] slower melting Iceberg right they want
[05:34] to keep the mass the big the USA Canada
[05:37] they want to keep them a little more
[05:38] comfortable it's like the analogy of the
[05:41] uh the frog in the pot you know you can
[05:44] you can put a frog in a pot on the stove
[05:46] and if you just turn the temperature up
[05:48] just enough he'll stay there and you can
[05:50] just slowly Crank It Up and Up and Up
[05:53] and Up Until the Frog actually dies it
[05:55] boils and it never realized it was
[05:58] getting boiled they never jumped out of
[06:00] the pot and this is true you can
[06:01] actually do this and and that to me is
[06:04] what's going on around us today you know
[06:06] in uh I know you're in Europe I'm in
[06:09] Canada and us but so we're pretty
[06:12] fortunate you know we're the top uh
[06:14] First World countries that aren't
[06:15] experiencing uh inflation at a hyper
[06:18] level and and where did where did your
[06:22] journey start at like uh you mentioned
[06:25] that they like the frog in the in the
[06:28] hot water why did you jump out of
[06:31] it uh I you know what uh I'm a Christian
[06:35] and and I do believe in God and I do
[06:38] believe God puts people in our lives uh
[06:41] for a reason and and I was blessed and I
[06:43] tell this man I I still see him at work
[06:46] uh I I was fortunate enough to work
[06:47] beside somebody that was into crypto in
[06:50] 2016 and
[06:52] 2017 uh he was into more he he is a
[06:54] bitcoiner but he does uh go off the
[06:57] rails into the altcoins and uh he was
[07:00] big on ethereum in
[07:02] 2017 and that's where my journey started
[07:04] was with ethereum at the top of 2017 and
[07:09] I just put a little bit of money into it
[07:10] I had knew nothing about it it was just
[07:12] my friend at work told me this isn't the
[07:14] next big thing so put money into it and
[07:17] uh fortunately right after that it had
[07:18] collapsed so my one ethereum at $1,200
[07:21] went down to like $200 I sold it didn't
[07:25] really care until the bull but this man
[07:28] he's last he understands the financial
[07:31] system and he was able to to bestow his
[07:34] knowledge upon me for the year or two we
[07:36] worked together so that's who I owe it
[07:39] to uh that's how I started my journey
[07:42] and from there I've branched off on my
[07:44] own I've went Bitcoin only I realized
[07:47] that everything else even ethereum the
[07:49] number two asset in the world the next
[07:52] one down is a scam right you have your
[07:54] 70% pre-mine you have your centralized
[07:57] nodes uh that run on on Amazon servers
[08:01] right like there's so many attack
[08:02] vectors with ethereum nobody knows the
[08:04] cap so right then and there even just
[08:07] the next one down is a to me is a scam
[08:09] so I'm Bitcoin
[08:11] only that's amazing um so you started
[08:15] with ethereum went on uh with Bitcoin
[08:19] only because you actually did the
[08:20] research you did the homework you did
[08:22] the studying and you also mentioned that
[08:24] you're a Christian and you also work
[08:26] with I think a church to set them up
[08:29] with Bitcoin donations you
[08:31] said I'm amazed that inside of the
[08:35] Bitcoin Community there's actually
[08:36] really strong and connected Christian
[08:40] Community and I think Robert bedlo and
[08:43] other people are doing great work on
[08:45] that um what do you think is the main
[08:48] connection between uh Christians and
[08:51] Bitcoin and where's this strong
[08:54] correlation a strong value uh comparison
[08:58] also coming com
[08:59] from uh I if I could put it down to one
[09:03] word I would think it would be
[09:05] Faith because early on in your
[09:08] Christianity along with early on in your
[09:12] Bitcoin uh career you have to have faith
[09:16] uh even to this point I have spent two
[09:18] to three 400 hours like listening to
[09:21] podcast setting up minors uh running a
[09:24] node and I have barely begun to scratch
[09:27] the surface of Bitcoin so
[09:30] I I couldn't tell you with 100%
[09:32] certainty what Bitcoin is what it does
[09:35] or or even how to explain it you know
[09:37] I'm just to the point where I'm starting
[09:39] to understand utxo management you know
[09:42] and and doing interactions through my
[09:44] own node and you know being able to
[09:47] validate transactions and I've put in
[09:49] hundreds of hours I couldn't imagine
[09:51] somebody that's done zero research and
[09:53] and you know a person like me is coming
[09:55] at them and trying to download all this
[09:57] in 2.2 it's it's the same as
[10:00] Christianity it is a faith based system
[10:03] at the beginning right faith is what you
[10:06] need to step off the ledge and that's
[10:09] what you need to do with Christianity
[10:10] and Bitcoin you have to take that first
[10:13] initial step and just trust right and I
[10:17] assure you both of them Christianity and
[10:19] Bitcoin are going to save you all right
[10:22] it is they both are real and they both
[10:25] are exactly what is Promised in the
[10:28] white paper and in the
[10:31] Bible if is Satoshi the god of
[10:38] Bitcoin I would say so I I would say
[10:41] Satoshi uh it almost they they kind of
[10:45] have similar kind of upbringings as the
[10:48] you know it's a miracle kind of like
[10:50] Satoshi backed off we we don't know
[10:52] where he went we know his million coins
[10:54] are sitting there you can look at them
[10:57] and he hasn't touched them right right
[10:59] so you can imagine the type of man that
[11:00] would it would take to sit there and see
[11:02] all that money and uh and not touch it
[11:06] and I believe Jesus was the same like he
[11:08] wasn't about money and I don't think
[11:10] Satoshi is either they both came to try
[11:13] and heal and make and fix so yeah that's
[11:17] a good correlation good comparison it's
[11:20] a crazy thing to think about if you have
[11:23] a person maybe it's just one person
[11:25] maybe it's more persons um to have a
[11:29] million Bitcoin seeing the value of that
[11:33] the purchasing power of that one million
[11:36] Bitcoin from nothing because at some
[11:38] point Bitcoin was worth uh from
[11:41] purchasing power standpoint worth
[11:43] nothing to millions billions and so much
[11:48] more
[11:50] and what's your do you have a theory
[11:54] around satosi do you have some um why
[11:58] did he not do it did he went under did
[12:02] he throw R keys to his
[12:05] Bitcoins I have tried to go down that
[12:08] that like historical path of Bitcoin
[12:10] like I said earlier in the podcast like
[12:12] there's so many Avenues you can go down
[12:15] and it just depends on sometimes I feel
[12:16] like learning about Mining and sometimes
[12:18] I I I want to learn more about Satoshi
[12:20] sometimes I want to learn more about
[12:22] exchanges noes but yeah I did go down
[12:25] that that path with Satoshi and uh it's
[12:28] very some of the waters and and there's
[12:30] characters that let pop up you you know
[12:32] you didn't even realize were there like
[12:34] Nick Zabo and how finny to me I I think
[12:39] how finny had his fingers in Bitcoin the
[12:42] most whether it was him or not it
[12:46] definitely because we know of the
[12:47] communications between Hal and Satoshi
[12:50] that he was in direct contact with him
[12:53] uh whether he was setting us up to think
[12:55] he it wasn't him he could easily do that
[12:58] but if I had had to pick I would think
[13:00] it was how
[13:04] halfin we I just had a crazy F in my
[13:06] mind uh we are now thinking in 2000 1999
[13:12] and stuff like that and before and after
[13:16] U with also with the
[13:18] Christianity and could the Bitcoin
[13:22] creation also be a new creation of a
[13:26] time zone of an era where we like it was
[13:30] in Thousand Years it was like before and
[13:32] after the Bitcoin creation because
[13:35] Bitcoin is kind of a time chain and you
[13:38] can even more accurately tell the time
[13:42] with that I know there's a big time
[13:44] chain crowd out there I'm right now not
[13:47] that big into that uh do you have did
[13:50] you went down that rabbit hole at at
[13:53] some point yeah like I really think the
[13:56] creation of Bitcoin was divine in itself
[13:59] it was like a gift to humanity and and
[14:02] that's why we as um bitcoiners really
[14:05] need to try and orange pill uh at least
[14:09] one person a day at least try and bring
[14:12] it up in the conversation
[14:14] organically even for me I have a tap uh
[14:19] a phone I tap and I have a Visa through
[14:21] Shak pay and I get 1% Bitcoin back and
[14:24] and I always when I tap it I always tell
[14:26] the cashier oh thanks for the free
[14:28] Bitcoin
[14:29] and I hope that that is just like
[14:31] fishing right it's a lure you throw out
[14:34] there and sometimes the fish bites and
[14:36] sometimes it doesn't but you have to
[14:38] have your lure in the water to catch
[14:40] somebody and and that's the only way
[14:42] this is going to work is we start
[14:44] bringing people in uh and teaching them
[14:48] right because like we said we both know
[14:49] it is a daunting task to even understand
[14:53] uh Bitcoin at a first principal level to
[14:56] even understand to teach people that the
[14:58] money is is broken that the money
[15:00] they're using is is being printed to
[15:03] Infinity you know real estate's going
[15:05] through the roof and we know through
[15:07] Jeff Boo's book the price of tomorrow
[15:09] that Society is in is
[15:12] deflationary and you can see that in the
[15:14] price of
[15:15] TVs right here it TVs have dropped in
[15:20] price like I was in Walmart yesterday
[15:22] and I could buy a 70inch TV for
[15:25] $500 10 years ago that same TV would
[15:28] have cost me
[15:30] $10,000 how have TVs dropped in value
[15:34] while everything else around us has gone
[15:35] up in value well you learn that Society
[15:38] is deflationary if the government keeps
[15:41] its fingers out of it and and stops
[15:43] manipulating and picking winners and
[15:46] losers and causing uh Market
[15:50] Distortion that that naturally over our
[15:53] lives prices should fall we should be as
[15:55] people working
[15:56] less and saving more but we're not we're
[16:00] all on this melting Iceberg and most
[16:02] people don't even realize it so I think
[16:04] as bitcoiners it's very important that
[16:06] we try and teach people and bring as
[16:09] many on as as possible that's just it's
[16:13] something that should be ingrained in
[16:15] every bitcoiner is just try and help be
[16:18] be a person that
[16:20] helps is that the mission of every
[16:22] pardon me is the bringing more bitcoiner
[16:27] in the miss
[16:29] of everyone that holds Bitcoin I called
[16:35] it uh you know each person's an
[16:38] individual like I have a a cousin that
[16:42] Bitcoins and and he's very introverted
[16:45] and has a hard time communicating with
[16:48] people uh so for him I try and get him
[16:51] out of his out of his comfort zone and
[16:54] and like I said with my seminar I've
[16:56] texted him and told him multiple times
[16:58] that he's going to be sitting there
[16:59] beside me in class and he's like no way
[17:01] can't do it can't talk in public I'm
[17:04] like well neither can I but the fact
[17:06] that matter is the people around us are
[17:08] becoming poor every day your friends and
[17:10] family the people you love if you're not
[17:12] telling them about Bitcoin why why
[17:15] they're being drowned like you need to
[17:18] like beat the dead horse until people
[17:21] get it you know that's my opinion for
[17:23] him is not so much he's introverted so I
[17:27] think there's only a few of us in the
[17:28] community that can stand up and and
[17:31] speak well and be leaders and if you are
[17:34] one of those people like yourself Robin
[17:36] I think we do owe it to um Society in
[17:39] general to try and help yeah for
[17:42] sure but I wouldn't put any pressure on
[17:44] somebody like I wouldn't say you should
[17:46] be doing it no because that might be the
[17:49] difference between someone staying or
[17:50] someone going is feeling pressured or
[17:53] forced to that this is an aspect of
[17:55] Bitcoin like I'm not one of those people
[17:57] on Twitter that that it's like oh got to
[17:59] eat me or or got to use a cast iron pan
[18:03] to me it's like you know cook with what
[18:05] you got you know try and eat healthy
[18:07] live a good life and and Live and Let
[18:10] Live try not to like force other people
[18:13] to live the way you think they should
[18:16] yeah my way of uh telling people of of
[18:20] Bitcoin also changed actually the last
[18:23] three four years a lot in the beginning
[18:25] I was like you have to buy this you do
[18:27] have to do it and now I also like I'm
[18:31] well known in everywhere where I go that
[18:34] I'm the Bitcoin guy I post a lot on
[18:35] social media I'm with my face there my
[18:37] real name there everybody who knows me
[18:40] knows I'm the Bitcoin guy this makes
[18:42] stuff easier because interested people
[18:45] in Bitcoin come up to me because they
[18:47] know I'm that Bitcoin guy and uh what I
[18:52] found is amazing that if you let them
[18:57] have their space and give them the right
[19:00] information at the right time they're
[19:02] going on their Bitcoin path themselves
[19:04] like my best friends are now all in
[19:07] Bitcoin like not not not even going in
[19:11] Bitcoin they're like all in bit they are
[19:13] really deep into it and and never push
[19:16] them they I just was there for them in
[19:19] helping them and pointing them to books
[19:23] to articles to to videos to everything
[19:26] they would need to get it
[19:28] but I never was like it's that way and
[19:31] that way only I also have some friends
[19:34] that are against it some friends they
[19:37] they read the Bitcoin standard and say
[19:38] no it's and I'm like okay let's
[19:42] let's meet in in one year again and
[19:44] let's discuss it like it's it's okay if
[19:46] you don't get it it's it's everybody has
[19:49] his own time of of understanding Bitcoin
[19:52] ignorance is bliss i' I've thought in
[19:54] the last couple days actually I've had
[19:56] the thought pop in my head of like what
[19:58] do would be like to go back pre Bitcoin
[20:00] pre knowing that Fiat was a scam and and
[20:03] just to live in that
[20:05] ignorance it'd be nice because once you
[20:08] lift the veil there's no going back
[20:10] right once you realize money is a scam
[20:14] and you're like oh my gosh what else and
[20:17] it just you keep going and going and
[20:19] going and and that is why I love Bitcoin
[20:21] is because there's no end to it there's
[20:24] literally you could spend thousands of
[20:27] hours studying and and there's no end to
[20:29] it and and people like you and me are
[20:32] doing things for free this podcast my
[20:36] seminar orange pilling the church I
[20:39] literally receive no uh Fiat gains for
[20:42] that I'm out there doing it for for the
[20:45] goodness of my heart because I'm I'm
[20:46] trying to help people and I realize that
[20:49] Bitcoin is what it is it's amazing
[20:52] bitcoiners will do things for free where
[20:56] you don't find that in the real world
[20:57] very often
[21:00] I I could ask that actually I get zero
[21:03] Euros or SATs or whatever for Content
[21:05] creation I'm doing the podcast I'm doing
[21:08] Ma I grew this year alone from like 400
[21:11] followers to
[21:13] 6,500 uh I I do so many tweets a day
[21:18] sometimes I have a month with one to F
[21:20] 2,000 tweets because of all the replies
[21:22] I'm doing and I get zero zero SS and
[21:26] zero uh Euro from that from no nobody
[21:30] and I don't care I do it because I love
[21:33] it I love to talk about it it's like I I
[21:36] think if I don't do it I I have that
[21:40] energy in me and it does not come out
[21:42] like it will boil inside of me and it
[21:44] will explode at some point so so that's
[21:49] why I'm doing doing that it gives me so
[21:52] much pleasure and joy and it's uh it's
[21:54] amazing to have something that gives you
[21:56] so much joy and pleasure
[21:58] um even though it's not related to money
[22:02] even though it's not related to food
[22:03] even though it's not related to sex it
[22:05] just gives you joy and pleasure without
[22:07] the usual things that give you joy and
[22:09] pleasure to me to me what early on in
[22:12] Bitcoin for me I was uh more of the
[22:16] libertarian I was more anti-government
[22:19] anti- banking like up up here in Canada
[22:22] we have limits uh for transfers for
[22:26] deposits withdrawals every everything is
[22:28] centralized and controlled I if I wanted
[22:31] to send you $4,000 right now I couldn't
[22:34] do it my bank limits me to $33,000 a day
[22:38] e
[22:39] transfers it's my money Robin why why if
[22:42] I want to send you a million dollars why
[22:45] shouldn't I be able to well I put in the
[22:47] effort at work to earn the money you
[22:50] know the bank is just there to cash my
[22:52] check originally it was now it's if I
[22:55] went in there to get out $10,000 cash
[22:57] I'd have to answer answer questions like
[23:00] that that to me is actually it gets my
[23:03] blood boiling like that irritates me
[23:05] that I have to you know be a grown man
[23:07] earn my money and then I have to go to a
[23:10] bank teller and tell him you know I'm
[23:13] taking $10,000 to buy guns or ammo you
[23:16] know uh and then what I have to answer
[23:19] more questions like this is my money so
[23:21] that's what's I kind of attracted me to
[23:24] bitcoin and then it it just snowballed
[23:27] from there I I I wanted to learn about
[23:29] the mining so I bought some S9 hooked
[23:31] them up which are are incredibly easy
[23:34] and they're great for garage space
[23:36] heaters like I have one running in my
[23:38] basement right now an S9 and a couple
[23:40] out in my garage keeping them all warm I
[23:43] I do it at a loss because energy is so
[23:45] expensive but the heat that I receive to
[23:49] me is like indispensable if I can take
[23:51] my kids Ms after a winter day and put
[23:53] them in front of the S9 and they heat my
[23:55] kids gloves like Hallelujah
[24:01] Bitcoin
[24:03] so your gloves that's that's that's
[24:07] great and I do I actually have a drying
[24:09] rack uh above like the miner and I put
[24:12] my kids clothes when they get home from
[24:14] school they'll be home in like half an
[24:15] hour uh I put all the clothes out there
[24:17] and the miner blows hot air underneath
[24:20] them and it rises and dries them know to
[24:23] me Bitcoin it's going to change the
[24:24] world you are either you accept it now
[24:27] or you're going to accept it later but
[24:29] Bitcoin will be everywhere I I imagine
[24:31] our home appliances will soon be mining
[24:34] our furnaces for our house there'll be
[24:37] uh miners run off them and then they you
[24:39] may not even know about it the company
[24:41] that that sells it they may even put it
[24:43] in there and mind themselves and use
[24:45] your energy it's the the the future is
[24:49] so bright for Bitcoin and I'm so excited
[24:52] to be a part of it and here at I believe
[24:55] the beginning of the scurve uh you know
[24:57] some some people might think that uh the
[24:59] law of diminishing returns means that
[25:01] we're kind of at like the peak and it's
[25:02] going to a Wayan for a little bit
[25:05] but if you go around and ask a 100
[25:08] people uh anything about Bitcoin and
[25:10] you'll realize that we are so early and
[25:13] I post that quite a bit like because I
[25:15] do I'm out there orange pilling quite a
[25:17] bit and I'm talking to a lot of people
[25:19] like you see I orange pilled my church I
[25:21] went to church to try and find God and
[25:23] and I just couldn't find myself stopping
[25:27] from trying to tell them there that guys
[25:30] realized that we all part of a
[25:31] manipulated system and whatnot and
[25:35] fortunately they were very uh open to
[25:37] the idea of Bitcoin and I'm actually
[25:39] going Thursday with the VP of the church
[25:42] to finalize the wallet because we did
[25:44] set up a lightning Arrangement through
[25:48] Phoenix and I don't know if you know
[25:50] anything about the fees right now but
[25:51] the fees on bitcoin are through the roof
[25:54] yeah they are they are quite quite High
[25:57] a little bit High than
[25:59] usual I've actually told my my uh church
[26:02] that I'm just going to save up the
[26:04] Bitcoin and then I'll send it to you in
[26:05] a larger chunk once the fees are a
[26:07] little bit lower which is a beautiful
[26:09] thing about Bitcoin you can you can
[26:10] arrange things you can you know say okay
[26:13] I'll hold it here and then I'll move it
[26:14] when the fees are
[26:16] cheaper right I and I went down the hole
[26:18] with the fees too uh you know
[26:21] understanding what's going on there why
[26:22] are the fees going up and to me it from
[26:24] what I understand it's what's called a
[26:26] Dos ATT which is a denial of service
[26:29] attack they're actually spamming our
[26:31] Network right now if you look here at
[26:32] the bit feed you can click on some of
[26:34] these transactions and people are paying
[26:36] $2 to send 37 cents I think it's the
[26:39] ordinals uh scam going on they're just
[26:43] trying to congest our Network to make it
[26:45] look unusable but we know Bitcoin
[26:49] doesn't
[26:50] care they they're basically paying uh
[26:54] the miners they're paying for security
[26:57] uh
[26:58] like the I don't know what they're
[27:00] thinking if if they actually people that
[27:03] try to DS Bitcoin now uh if this
[27:07] actually is the case I don't know what
[27:09] is their game plan because they're just
[27:11] giving more financial energy do Bitcoin
[27:16] that's what it is um I wanted to go back
[27:20] one step what you said you said uh when
[27:23] you said about the banks that they
[27:25] you're not allowed to uh uh give me more
[27:29] than €3,000 because there's like a limit
[27:32] isn't it crazy
[27:34] that your money is basically uh your
[27:38] life's energy like you work for
[27:40] something you get back money so
[27:42] basically money is kind of time kind of
[27:45] your life's
[27:47] energy and once you understand that
[27:50] you're like wait there's an institution
[27:53] in our world that can control where I
[27:56] put my life's energy
[27:58] how is this different from
[28:01] slavery it's not we actually live we
[28:04] actually live in an open air prison
[28:07] right we're still slaves the only chains
[28:10] that we wear now are debt right we live
[28:13] in a debt based society so all of us are
[28:17] burdened with debt and it's a lot of
[28:19] debt like even for me and Canada to own
[28:22] a home is you know you're talking a
[28:24] million dollars like to get something
[28:26] for a family that that's a lot of debt
[28:28] to take on right and then you have
[28:30] credit cards and they'll Finance
[28:32] anything you could Finance anything in
[28:34] Canada you know there's a company that
[28:36] will send you financing and then those
[28:38] are the chains that we put on and the
[28:40] chains I'm trying even myself to break
[28:42] free of is debt that's this that's the
[28:45] new slavery is
[28:47] debt yeah great um where do you see when
[28:51] you see the Bitcoin standard evolving
[28:54] when everybody's hopping on on bitcoin
[28:56] and everybody is uh on a complete
[28:59] Bitcoin standard where do you see the
[29:01] role of centralized planning of
[29:04] basically
[29:05] governments uh do you see changes what
[29:08] changes do you see what what will change
[29:11] with government when we are fully
[29:13] adopted with
[29:15] Bitcoin that's a tough
[29:17] question that's a really tough question
[29:20] to me I think uh governments would be
[29:22] scaled back you wouldn't have all these
[29:25] departments and Departments of
[29:27] Department ments and all these staffers
[29:29] and this bloat the government has is
[29:32] bloated it's incentivized to spend and
[29:36] blow I think once people realize Bitcoin
[29:39] is scarce and you cannot just print it
[29:43] that governments will be a little more
[29:44] careful with their money they'll become
[29:46] accountable because Bitcoin is an open-
[29:49] Source ledger so we the people can see
[29:52] where the money is
[29:54] going so I think governments will be
[29:58] much much smaller uh much more um you
[30:02] know
[30:03] localized and they would actually tackle
[30:05] issues and they would need to create
[30:08] value for the taxpayers if they do not
[30:11] create value they're not needed that's
[30:14] the problem with governments today they
[30:16] can print and pay and get no value
[30:21] they're taking our debt our money and
[30:23] paying these departments and and we're
[30:25] getting we're getting no value for them
[30:27] and they get to stay we're in the
[30:29] Bitcoin standard no value no bueno adios
[30:33] you
[30:34] go I love that line so much
[30:38] great no no value
[30:41] adios um maybe for people that are into
[30:46] Bitcoin but they are not running their
[30:48] minus and they're not running their own
[30:50] note um why did you start with that and
[30:54] would you recommend that to other people
[30:57] let's start with the minor and like
[30:59] Miner I think is more gravable for for
[31:02] people and also let's start with the
[31:04] minor why did you start the miner and
[31:07] would you recommend doing that uh yeah I
[31:11] I started like I said in uh with the GPU
[31:14] miners I did it because um I I just for
[31:18] me I need to know how something works
[31:20] like I'm a mechanic I'm an industrial
[31:22] mechanic by trade so I'm the type of I
[31:25] my job is to make sure a factory runs
[31:28] like I'm actually responsible for large
[31:30] robots that move large large uh pieces
[31:33] of of uh whatever product we're building
[31:35] right I don't want to dox myself too
[31:37] much but uh so I I'm just genetically I
[31:41] need to know what gears are turning and
[31:44] and why so maybe not everybody will go
[31:47] down the same path as me and and you
[31:49] don't it's not essential to run a minor
[31:52] it it it is important to run a node so
[31:55] that you can verify your own transaction
[31:57] because if you don't run a node you're
[31:58] relying on somebody else that is right
[32:01] and it you're not supposed to trust in
[32:04] Bitcoin but when it comes to nodes
[32:07] there's a little bit of trust right
[32:09] because the Bitcoin goes from where you
[32:11] send it to your wallet so you can you
[32:13] know that it worked but you you don't
[32:15] have record of it you you don't have any
[32:17] type of verifiability like I could pop
[32:20] up my node here and punch in one command
[32:23] and within it does take a few minutes
[32:24] but it will tell me exactly down to the
[32:27] eth decimal how many Bitcoins are in
[32:29] existence right so I know and mine is
[32:33] hooked up to my wallet my node so the
[32:36] minute I hit send on my
[32:38] phone uh within a few minutes I get a
[32:40] notification here and then I know that
[32:43] that Bitcoin is 100% Bitcoin there's no
[32:45] way it's it's anything but that to me
[32:48] that verifiability is is important it
[32:51] may not be so important to other people
[32:54] but like I say on a on a first
[32:57] on a fundamental level I have to know
[33:00] how things work even even the GPU
[33:03] miners I can remember at one point I was
[33:05] stuck for hours and the the GPU wouldn't
[33:08] turn on and it just wouldn't fire up and
[33:10] I'm like what is going on and I I I lost
[33:13] sleep over it and and I took out my
[33:16] multimeter and I had to test every part
[33:18] of the circuit until I found the the
[33:20] broken connection and and it was
[33:22] actually just a power connection inside
[33:24] the little tab was broken you know most
[33:28] people I I find would just give up and
[33:29] throw it away I'm not that type like I I
[33:32] have to dig
[33:34] deeper and and fortunately I think
[33:36] Bitcoin has helped me become that way
[33:39] right going down the rabbit hole has has
[33:41] made me lift the veil on so many other
[33:44] things so I think a node is important to
[33:47] run and they're super simple to run uh
[33:50] you know I bought a computer from Best
[33:52] Buy for $140 a desktop computer uh
[33:56] plugged it into my TV TV here and you
[33:58] only need I suggest a two terabyte hard
[34:01] drive but a one terabyte will do for now
[34:04] and all you do is a couple clicks
[34:06] download Bitcoin core from the internet
[34:09] and within a few days it needs to sync
[34:13] with the blockchain so what it's doing
[34:14] is downloading every single transaction
[34:16] from the Genesis block and then now you
[34:19] have a record of it at your house so
[34:22] there's nobody can you know you can't do
[34:24] that with gold I I have a friend that a
[34:27] gold bug and I'm always sending him
[34:28] pictures of like gold bars that are
[34:30] cracked open with like tungsten in the
[34:31] middle or something you know like you
[34:34] can scam with gold you can't do that
[34:37] with with anything but Bitcoin to verify
[34:40] that it's 100% real is an aspect I don't
[34:43] think people grasp like to me that's
[34:47] amazing yeah uh it's quite hard to
[34:51] verify like the gold debate is so
[34:55] interesting for me because they only
[34:56] have one one good argument and it's the
[34:58] track record like yeah go go is just so
[35:02] long there but everything else uh it's
[35:06] just a lost debate by now uh it's I was
[35:09] in I actually got orange build a lot by
[35:13] those gold debates uh when I was looking
[35:15] into Bitcoin in
[35:17] 2020 and 2020 and they opened my eyes to
[35:23] gold and Bitcoin uh so I was
[35:27] before only stocks and an asset has to
[35:30] have an cash flow otherwise it's not
[35:32] valuable I come from this War Buffet
[35:35] mindset and this gold and Bitcoin debate
[35:38] actually opened my mind to oh there's
[35:39] another possibility out
[35:43] there but it's so clear like why
[35:47] go I I myself hold a bit of silver
[35:51] because I'm like I said back I'm a
[35:53] Libertarian so during Co I really
[35:56] realized oh my God gosh like you need to
[35:57] have some systems in place to protect
[36:00] your family you need to have a food
[36:02] storage you need to have maybe some cash
[36:04] on hand but you do also need to have
[36:07] precious metals like in in an emergency
[36:10] situation they do hold value and you
[36:13] would be able to you could possibly
[36:15] trade somebody for it but to to hold
[36:18] your life's energy in it is foolish like
[36:21] it's been flat for forever right like
[36:25] they said back in the day it should a
[36:27] bar of gold should or one ounce of gold
[36:29] should buy a suit and still to this day
[36:31] it's done that and to me it's it's
[36:34] manipulated too we all know that the
[36:36] paper Market is vast vastly larger than
[36:38] the physical market so it's been
[36:41] captured by centralized authorities and
[36:45] it will never be released because of its
[36:48] uh uh weight its properties it's it's a
[36:50] heavy dense metal like good luck sending
[36:52] it across the ocean at lightning speed
[36:55] you can't do that right that's where
[36:56] Bitcoin is superior you know it's
[36:59] frictionless you can send it to
[37:01] Zimbabwe it's expensive today because
[37:03] fees are high but when they go back down
[37:06] you can send it for
[37:08] nothing why did you choose why did you
[37:11] choose silver over
[37:14] gold uh again it was back my person that
[37:18] I worked with he told me that Gold's uh
[37:20] for kings and Silvers for the people
[37:24] right silver is like more of a currency
[37:27] uh it's and it
[37:29] really I just kind of like to look in
[37:32] the feel of it and for me to give ,000
[37:35] and get a little speck of gold I just
[37:37] don't see the value in for some reason
[37:39] that's me because I get a nice heavy bar
[37:41] of silver for you know $300 to me
[37:44] there's something about the weight of it
[37:47] that gives it value I'm probably wrong
[37:49] but it's just some I have quirks you
[37:51] know you follow me on Twitter I'm odd
[37:54] yeah it's y mean are fire I love it
[37:59] yeah sometimes I just have a way of of
[38:02] relating everything to bitcoin and and a
[38:04] way of just like some of these uh memes
[38:07] that I post I just me late at work at
[38:09] night like I say I work midnight so I'm
[38:11] just sitting there in the factory alone
[38:13] and I'm just scrolling I'm like oh my
[38:15] God that's just like Bitcoin here hold
[38:17] on click click click post and it
[38:20] apparently people can relate to it right
[38:22] because they are blowing up yeah myself
[38:26] like started off two years ago with you
[38:28] know 300 followers and I've grown the
[38:30] account to like 6,200 yeah you're doing
[38:33] great man you thank I love it um but you
[38:37] also created a website called a bit Day
[38:41] cards what is that and and and why did
[38:43] you start that
[38:45] one um I mentioned earlier I have a
[38:47] cousin that's into Bitcoin he's a one
[38:50] person I was able to orange pill and he
[38:51] he took on to it like crazy he's stacked
[38:54] like crazy he lives at home with his mom
[38:55] so he's able to do that um I
[38:59] unfortunately not in the same situation
[39:01] but I'm trying as hard as as him uh we
[39:03] both just love Bitcoin like I I could
[39:06] just do Bitcoin all day like I could
[39:08] listen to podcasts read books you know
[39:10] check my node plug in my miners just all
[39:14] day every day Bitcoin so I wanted to
[39:16] work in Bitcoin but I'm I'm not super
[39:19] technical I'm not a a financial guy like
[39:22] I don't know uh you know a bond yield
[39:25] curves like Preston and I'm like so I
[39:28] wanted to work in Bitcoin somehow and
[39:31] and Seed phrases to me a seed phrases
[39:34] again you could go down days and days of
[39:37] learning about seed phrases and what
[39:38] they are and where they come from and
[39:40] and what they do and how they do it it's
[39:42] amazing but you can literally gift
[39:46] somebody Bitcoin through 12 words right
[39:49] like if I knew a a seed phrase right on
[39:51] this podcast I could just tell you 12
[39:54] words you could go on your computer
[39:55] punch some in and have access to that
[39:57] Bitcoin right that that to me is is
[40:00] another amazing feature so that's what
[40:02] we tried to do uh if you go on bit Day
[40:05] cards we created a little character his
[40:07] name is B rex he's a little
[40:09] Tyrannosaurus and he wants to teach you
[40:11] there's a section that teaches you about
[40:12] Bitcoin and Seed phrases but we also uh
[40:15] design these cards with a a 12-word uh
[40:19] area for them and a little scenery
[40:22] they're kind of themed there's a cowboy
[40:24] one and an astronaut one but you can
[40:26] it teaches you on the website through QR
[40:28] codes you scan the QR code it will take
[40:30] you to a section in our website where it
[40:32] teaches you to create a seed phrase it
[40:34] teaches you how to load the seed phrase
[40:36] with Bitcoin write the seed phrase in
[40:38] the card gift it mail it to whoever you
[40:41] want uh to me I like sending them to
[40:43] people that aren't orange pilled and it
[40:46] kind of forces people to learn about
[40:48] Bitcoin right they have to scan the QR
[40:51] code if they want their funds it's great
[40:53] for birthdays if they want their funds
[40:55] they're going to have to learn how to
[40:56] interact with the Bitcoin Network which
[40:58] to me is like a forced orange pilling
[41:01] and uh I haven't put as much energy into
[41:03] it as I'd like to but it's starting to
[41:05] pick up traction and we're focusing a
[41:07] little more a little more on it so uh
[41:10] thanks for asking about that I
[41:11] appreciate that yeah it's an really cool
[41:14] uh project I I checked it out right
[41:17] before um our podcast and I L that I
[41:20] have to check it out a little more in
[41:22] depth yeah it's a bit day cards.com
[41:27] yeah I you are now my 11th guest on the
[41:32] podcast and I noticed a
[41:34] pattern
[41:36] uh the guests till now all had uh kids
[41:42] they all were fathers of uh of of kids
[41:46] um most of them more than two two one or
[41:50] more than one or sometimes even more
[41:52] than
[41:53] two why do you think this is is there
[41:57] something about having kids and Bitcoin
[42:00] is is this also tied to maybe the to the
[42:03] chrisan Christianity to the the faith uh
[42:08] and and uh the conservative uh belief
[42:12] that bitcoiners usually have is do do
[42:15] you see that do you have any thoughts
[42:16] about that for sure for sure it actually
[42:19] says in the Bible to God tells us to be
[42:22] fruitful and multiply it's actually we
[42:25] are supposed to increase as a society
[42:29] you know our population is supposed to
[42:32] get bigger and bigger I know the
[42:33] mainstream media doesn't want you to
[42:35] believe that uh and again Bitcoin is
[42:37] taking me down the rabbit hole of of
[42:40] learning can Earth sustain 8 billion
[42:43] people and from the research I've done
[42:47] it can easily and and if you listen to
[42:49] Elon musque he also advocates for ever
[42:54] growing population and and and I think
[42:56] the mainstream media is trying to push
[42:57] us an alternate narrative that maybe
[43:00] we're using too much and too much energy
[43:02] all that stuff is foolish as Society you
[43:05] sh your energy production and your
[43:07] population should be
[43:09] increasing like we are becoming more
[43:11] sophisticated as a species why would we
[43:13] not become more energy efficient create
[43:17] bigger sources of energy so we can maybe
[43:19] get off this planet become an
[43:21] interplanetary species right so kicking
[43:24] back to your original question is I
[43:26] think bitcoiners realize this and and
[43:28] Bitcoin brings you abundance and it
[43:30] brings you Security Financial Security
[43:33] and when you aren't stressed about money
[43:36] then you can focus on other things like
[43:39] creating a family you know and working
[43:42] less and spending time with your wife
[43:44] and and and that is a gift of Bitcoin a
[43:48] bit a gift of scarcity and I think
[43:52] that's what's going on with bitcoiners
[43:54] and Christianity like we said earlier on
[43:56] they both kind of intersect they kind of
[43:58] have similarities so I'm speaking to
[44:01] both of them and that's why I think we
[44:04] have a lot me me myself I have four
[44:06] Under 12 right uh and I love it it's
[44:10] it's amazing it's a gift from God to be
[44:13] able to watch a child grow and and all
[44:15] my kids know Bitcoin they know I'm on
[44:18] this podcast today Lucas Sophia Ethan
[44:21] and Cole wanted me to Nam drop them so
[44:24] there you go um and they all have
[44:26] wallets they all get paid in Bitcoin
[44:29] they all they don't understand Bitcoin
[44:30] on a technical level but they know about
[44:33] its scarcity they know about uh
[44:36] government corruption they know about
[44:38] money printing at at five years old six
[44:40] years old I'm trying to raise a a
[44:43] different generation and break chains
[44:46] right and uh that's a beautiful gift to
[44:48] bitcoin one of the best gifts of Bitcoin
[44:51] is being able to raise a family that's
[44:54] that's beautiful man um what do think is
[44:57] Will beit different about uh your kids
[45:01] they or your kids
[45:04] representing uh Bitcoin a generation
[45:07] that they they're living in the Bitcoin
[45:09] world like they are raised to be
[45:12] bitcoiners what are they having
[45:15] different from people that U were born
[45:18] in
[45:19] 1971 in in the Fe era uh my my father
[45:23] was born in in exactly 970
[45:26] uh one wow that's amazing uh they will
[45:30] understand um I think wastefulness like
[45:33] guys our generation or their
[45:35] generation they're very wasteful and I
[45:39] try and teach my kids about scarcity
[45:41] about once you do something you can undo
[45:43] it so you need to be mindful and think
[45:45] about what you're doing be uh deliberate
[45:48] in your actions because once you hit
[45:50] send on bitcoin there's no unsend right
[45:53] so you need to double check you know
[45:55] cross reference make sure the address is
[45:57] correct make sure you know who you're
[45:58] sending to I I think it will teach my
[46:01] kids to be diligent to be uh you know
[46:05] mindful of
[46:07] wastefulness and and
[46:09] also it helps teach them to be caring
[46:13] and loving individuals because Bitcoin
[46:15] is a system of love it is it is a
[46:18] network of people that care for each
[46:21] other and that want to see a better
[46:23] world and that's why I want my kids to
[46:26] be part of
[46:28] that I my third podcast actually the
[46:32] guest his tagline was Bitcoin is a
[46:35] system of love and I actually heard it
[46:37] for with him the first time and I I love
[46:43] it since ever since then I it's it's h
[46:47] it comes back to Truth uh to uh trust to
[46:52] uh believing and and and cheering for
[46:55] each other um It's a Wonderful system I
[46:58] love it exactly me too there's there's
[47:01] no I have yet to find a negative point
[47:04] about it except for this dos attack with
[47:07] the fees getting incredibly high but for
[47:10] me I haven't paid a single one like I'm
[47:12] you know I know how to circumvent that
[47:13] this my exchange doesn't charge me any
[47:16] fees to cold store so I I haven't been
[47:19] affected by these fees to me the only
[47:21] people affected by this short-term fee
[47:24] issue are day Traders degens that you
[47:27] know are looking to turn a quick Buck
[47:28] off of somebody like I don't I don't
[47:30] trade Bitcoin like that's the first
[47:32] thing people when I tell when I try and
[47:34] orange people like oh did you sell do
[47:35] you buy do you buy and sell do you sell
[47:37] buy I'm like no I I just buy it and I
[47:40] hold on to it and I'm never letting it
[47:42] go like any Bitcoin I buy is is going to
[47:45] go to my children likely like I I don't
[47:49] like if it did get to like
[47:51] hyperbitcoinization I might peel a
[47:53] little bit off to work even less than I
[47:55] do do uh but Bitcoin teaches you think
[47:59] generationally not you know yearly daily
[48:03] monthly charts I'm not interested in
[48:05] that that to me is just stressful it's
[48:07] gambling it is what it is and I'm not a
[48:10] gambler I work way too hard to
[48:12] gamble yeah that's uh that's a beautiful
[48:15] Point uh to end it with we have a end
[48:18] routine in the bcast uh where the
[48:21] previous guest asked the next guest a
[48:24] question uh and the previous guest does
[48:27] not know who's the next guest
[48:30] is um and the question from the previous
[48:33] guest to you uh without knowing you are
[48:37] you how many months of fiat currency are
[48:42] you currently holding and
[48:44] why how many
[48:46] months
[48:48] zero I I I hold as little Fiat as
[48:53] possible I I it me
[48:56] maybe do you want an actual number like
[48:59] I might have a $1,000 cash at all times
[49:02] oh just in just to cover like
[49:05] groceries uh short-term stuff anything
[49:09] anything else goes to bitcoin and if I
[49:12] if I if a thousand doesn't cover me then
[49:15] I will convert back but then I
[49:18] restack right but I'm 99% Bitcoin oh
[49:24] that's great yeah
[49:26] it's so easy to convert like my exchange
[49:28] does it instantly and then it can ET
[49:30] transfer to my bank account and the
[49:32] longest I've ever waited is half an hour
[49:34] so why would I ever sit and hold Fiat
[49:37] and wake up and watch Bitcoin has gone
[49:39] up
[49:40] 10% and I was sitting there on what
[49:43] $5,000 you know the gains you just
[49:45] missed right like and and we know
[49:48] historically if you don't get in on
[49:50] Bitcoin today it could be gone right
[49:54] these people are sitting back waiting
[49:55] for prices good luck like Bitcoin will
[49:58] go up 10% and never come back down we we
[50:01] may never see3 $6,000 again so what am I
[50:06] going to do s i that's to me becomes
[50:08] like a trading thing again trying to
[50:10] time it me when I get paid boom DCA
[50:14] instantly and then I'm then I'm trying
[50:16] to like squeeze every dollar and I can
[50:19] I'm like looking at my wife I'm like uh
[50:20] we don't need to eat out tonight do we
[50:23] and as soon as she says no we got
[50:24] something at home Bang 50 bucks of
[50:26] Bitcoin gone to Cold
[50:29] Storage I love that um for the end uh

[51:04] this morning telling me that it's a
[51:06] Ponzi scheme I sometimes I get a little
[51:09] little uh kind of Curt with them but I
[51:13] try and realize that hey that could be
[51:15] somebody that's one step away from
[51:16] Bitcoin so I need to be the leader the
[51:19] pillar and try and use words to bring
