[00:00] the idea is to write a word Bitcoin 21
[00:01] million times first of all why you
[00:04] should try to become the change that you
[00:06] want to see in the world and I want to
[00:07] see in the world hyperbitcoinization
[00:08] that was amazing if you do Bitcoin it
[00:11] simplifies your life with feat
[00:13] everything is complicated
[00:14] hyperbitcoinization is good but it will
[00:15] take 150 years or whatever it will take
[00:18] 200 years maybe it will never come I'm
[00:20] like I don't want to sit by and let that
[00:22] happen the obvious topic I invited you
[00:25] and I saw from you and you have on your
[00:28] TT feet a lot of times is the yeah wrri
[00:32] writing Bitcoin down 21 million times uh
[00:36] it's it's a task where I'm like first of
[00:39] all
[00:41] why and then it's like how do you keep
[00:44] track of it how many how many inks did
[00:47] you already buy for that and how far you
[00:49] have come like that's that's like kind
[00:50] of my first part of the questions yeah
[00:54] um about this subject I could talk
[00:56] literally for hours on end because this
[00:58] is not like I want to clarify right from
[01:00] the start I'm sane I'm healthy I'm happy
[01:03] I'm not in any kind of distress
[01:05] psychologically and it's not like some
[01:07] voice keep kept talking to me and said
[01:09] do this thing do this thing this is not
[01:11] like some kind of wild dream or wild
[01:13] invention this is something I thought
[01:15] about for many many years this has been
[01:16] many many years coming and it's like
[01:19] this Iceberg you have different
[01:20] motivations for doing things like in
[01:22] like in Psychology or like in strategy
[01:25] you have different ideas and different
[01:27] things and they keep on piling on top of
[01:29] each other and then at some point you
[01:31] have make a make a decision okay I'm
[01:33] going to do it this way like um I've
[01:36] been into writing using pen and paper to
[01:38] write stuff for all my life I'm 37 years
[01:42] old right now and since I was a little
[01:43] kid I was always writing writing was
[01:45] always my thing I always knew if I
[01:47] wanted to do something that that could
[01:49] present to the public it would be
[01:51] connected to writing something down so
[01:53] this is like decades and decades and
[01:54] decades on writing I have two University
[01:57] degrees two Bachelor degrees one of them
[01:59] is explicitly in language and literature
[02:03] and the other is in business but also
[02:05] with a minor in in literature so was
[02:07] always knew I would want to write
[02:09] something but you know how it is as a
[02:11] writer um you don't know what you write
[02:13] about that comes later to you and then
[02:16] when I when I saw about Bitcoin a few
[02:18] years after Bitcoin came out I'm like I
[02:20] have to do something about that I have
[02:22] to write something about that and um it
[02:24] took me many many years and I read so
[02:27] many books like you know you guys say
[02:29] they read tons and tons and tons of book
[02:31] about Bitcoin but some of them like me
[02:33] they took take a long time to be
[02:34] convinced like I hear about Bitcoin
[02:36] everybody has their Bitcoin story like
[02:38] when they heard the first time about
[02:40] Bitcoin did they go all in did they not
[02:43] go in did they do something with
[02:44] altcoins and for me I didn't go all in
[02:47] neither into Bitcoin nor into altcoins
[02:49] but it was a long journey of trying to
[02:51] understand Bitcoin it was really a
[02:52] process really grinding it out grinding
[02:54] it in your mind because this question to
[02:57] us to you and me and to other guests who
[03:00] have been in Bitcoin for so long for us
[03:01] now it seems obvious why Bitcoin is so
[03:04] good it's more it's simpler it has more
[03:06] more hash power it has has the specific
[03:08] circumstances where it wasn't rented
[03:10] it's it's Unique but I feel like um I
[03:13] feel like I was always an artist and and
[03:15] as an artist you want to express what's
[03:17] inside of you your positive feelings but
[03:19] also your frustrations for me trying to
[03:22] understand Bitcoin myself and trying to
[03:24] to convince others hey this is an
[03:26] interesting thing please look at this
[03:29] there's always this frustration like
[03:30] like it feels like you're talking with a
[03:32] wall like when you're talking to a
[03:33] boomer or or no no coiner and they
[03:36] always have another doubt you can talk
[03:38] to them literally I I had somebody with
[03:40] me on a holiday and and he was like are
[03:42] you really sure did you really do your
[03:45] research are you really certain that
[03:46] Bitcoin is a good thing or is it really
[03:48] maybe just magic internet money it's
[03:50] gone it's it's here today and gone
[03:52] tomorrow and I was literally with people
[03:55] on on holiday uh together we were a
[03:57] group and one of these guys he was like
[03:59] maybe I should he was teasing me you
[04:01] know when the no coer says yeah maybe I
[04:03] should look into this maybe I should
[04:04] invest it and I was like just hammering
[04:07] him like like he the white paper here
[04:10] this he that look at how central banks
[04:12] work look at how The Ledger work look at
[04:14] how this work that work and at the end
[04:16] he was still like yeah that's all very
[04:18] interesting but who are you like like
[04:21] who why should I trust you why should I
[04:22] use this this weird magic internet money
[04:25] and what I wanted to do was like and I
[04:27] feel like many Bitcoin I want to do that
[04:29] they want to reach into their brain or
[04:30] into their heart or into their soul or
[04:33] whatever and tear out all the thousands
[04:35] of hours of work we have done and then
[04:36] put it on a table and we like no you
[04:39] cannot get me with no you haven't done
[04:41] the work you don't know what you're
[04:42] talking about you're just some some
[04:44] weird conspiracy guy no I I have done
[04:46] the work and um what I hope that this
[04:50] this challenge is going to do it's going
[04:51] to have basically what you are trying to
[04:53] do what what any podcast is trying to do
[04:56] what any author is trying to do we're
[04:57] trying to help people um move to bitcoin
[05:01] isation faster right that's like that's
[05:04] like if you understand Bitcoin on a deep
[05:06] level at some point you realize it's
[05:08] inevitable it's inevitable so we could
[05:10] just hang back yeah like why are you
[05:11] podcasting why am I doing anything I've
[05:14] written a few articles why am I doing
[05:16] this if it's in inevitable anyway then
[05:18] why not just chill and do nothing about
[05:21] it and on the one hand it's really a
[05:24] passion like you can't stop it's it's
[05:25] it's not like a passion like you
[05:27] addicted like I'm not addicted to
[05:28] writing in the same way like a like a
[05:30] drug addict is addicted to drugs that's
[05:32] that's that's what I'm trying to to
[05:34] disprove or or dis disate from people
[05:37] because they sometimes they they they
[05:39] see my posts where I have written the
[05:41] words Bitcoin for thousands thousands of
[05:43] times and say are you mentally ill are
[05:44] you addicted and to me it's like if you
[05:46] have a favorite band if you have music
[05:48] if something that you really like and
[05:49] you want to want to share it and the
[05:52] other idea is a strategic idea so so
[05:54] again to very briefly the idea is I want
[05:57] to use paper or different paper like
[06:00] this like like small small notepads
[06:03] bigger notepads any kind of notep packs
[06:06] but in the future also other things like
[06:07] tapestry anything like writing for me
[06:10] writing can be anything like you can use
[06:11] a chemical and Edge something into glass
[06:14] or into metal as long as you use your
[06:16] hand for me it's writing like if you
[06:18] study art for example if you an art
[06:19] major I'm not an art major but I've
[06:21] talked to many Art majors if you talk to
[06:22] Art majors writing has many many many
[06:25] different forms more than you can do in
[06:27] your life there are more different
[06:28] writing instruments but again to recap
[06:31] the idea is to write a word Bitcoin 21
[06:33] million times and the idea is basically
[06:35] to have attention um for for Bitcoin
[06:38] increase and also the idea is what did
[06:41] Satoshi Nakamoto really do this is one
[06:43] of the fundamental questions in Bitcoin
[06:46] and and the naive or The Superficial
[06:48] answer yeah satui Nakamoto was this This
[06:50] brilliant genius like like a lightning
[06:52] came down from from heaven and that
[06:53] struck this one human or group of humans
[06:55] whoever Satoshi was and this person was
[06:58] just creating and and inventing and
[07:00] building Bitcoin but but if you are a
[07:03] little bit more sophisticated you you
[07:04] start to see it more like as a discovery
[07:06] like Bitcoin was this this thing out
[07:09] there and Satoshi was just discovering
[07:12] it like somebody discovered electricity
[07:14] like if you the scientist who discovered
[07:15] electricity it was always there you
[07:17] didn't create electricity you are not
[07:19] Zeus you are not God or something that
[07:21] created the laws of the universe you
[07:22] discovered it and Bitcoin is basically
[07:25] like an element like like a new element
[07:26] on the periodic St charts was always
[07:29] there there but he was discovered it but
[07:32] this means if Satoshi was never born if
[07:34] satosi was never born Bitcoin would
[07:36] still have been discovered but later and
[07:38] that's like the entire thing like like
[07:40] Elon Musk talks about it a lot he says
[07:42] certain things are inevitable but if you
[07:44] can push things forward then you save a
[07:45] lot of lives you save a lot of people
[07:47] like the first person that discovered
[07:49] penicillin it's very valuable and so the
[07:52] idea is um Satoshi discovered Bitcoin
[07:55] and basically Satoshi is like is like
[07:58] the example we all want to be a little
[08:00] bit when we say we are all huddl out we
[08:01] are all Satoshi the idea is that Satoshi
[08:04] did a very cool thing and we are trying
[08:06] to honor this this this discovery onor
[08:08] this this this great Network and so my
[08:11] my idea is like even even if I do this
[08:14] challenge um so again to do this
[08:16] challenge it will take me between 45 and
[08:19] 65 years so I will be an old man maybe I
[08:21] will die when I'm like at 10 million or
[08:23] so but I think if I'm very smart if I
[08:26] ride very fast I can do it in like 40
[08:28] years if I go very very fast and I
[08:30] should do it like in my 70s 80s and with
[08:33] to today's medicine for you and me to
[08:35] become 70 or 80 I think that's not
[08:37] unrealistic it's not crazy it's not easy
[08:40] but it's not like I'm trying to do
[08:41] something that is literally physically
[08:42] impossible it's not it's possible but I
[08:44] have to be happy not smoke or not drink
[08:47] so too much not go to some too many
[08:48] meetups and get drunk and um the idea is
[08:52] really to push adoption forward there's
[08:54] this very old saying like like by Gandhi
[08:57] for example this is this is the strategy
[09:00] part I already said it's my passion
[09:01] that's like the emotional part and now
[09:03] I'm coming to the to the strategy part
[09:05] the strategy part is why does my my
[09:08] project of writing the word Bitcoin 21
[09:11] million times why does this help why
[09:12] does this help people and my idea is um
[09:15] like Gandhi said you should try to
[09:17] become the change that you want to see
[09:18] in the world and I want to see in the
[09:20] world hyperbitcoinization that's what I
[09:22] want to see and there's always this
[09:24] argument yeah is hyperbitcoinization
[09:26] realistic if it's realistic how does it
[09:28] look like
[09:30] and um will it be will it be good if
[09:32] it's fast like there's there's this
[09:34] there's this very very deep Rabbit Hole
[09:35] like Michael sailor says we shouldn't
[09:37] have hyperbitcoinization too fast
[09:38] because then there will be lots of to
[09:40] mile the wings will be ripped off the
[09:42] airplane his engineering metaphor but
[09:44] people who have really deeply respect
[09:46] there are some people I really deeply
[09:47] respect in the Bitcoin space like K swam
[09:49] horn and kot swam makes this very very
[09:52] good point that says the situation right
[09:54] now with Fiat is so bad it's such a big
[09:56] problem that we cannot go fast enough
[09:59] and my idea is when I when I'm sitting
[10:00] in the spaces uh with people or not just
[10:03] spaces just talking with people and
[10:04] they're like yeah hyperbitcoinization is
[10:07] good but it will take 150 years or
[10:09] whatever it will take 200 years maybe it
[10:11] will never come I'm like I don't want to
[10:13] sit by and let that happen and it's like
[10:15] I'm just one person but I've always
[10:18] tried to believe in standing what you
[10:20] believe in if you believe in something
[10:22] you stand for it you sign your name to
[10:23] it you sign your your your time to it
[10:25] you you devote yourself to it if you
[10:27] have like like I have no kids but if I
[10:30] had children or if I'm going to have
[10:31] children I would make sure to really
[10:33] stand behind them I would say okay I'm
[10:35] taking this responsibility or
[10:36] responsibility and so I'm trying to do
[10:38] it with my life if I want to see
[10:40] something happen then I try to make it
[10:42] happen myself and so I try to Brute
[10:44] Force hyperbitcoinization so to speak
[10:47] and it's like it's like it's a deep
[10:49] Rabbit Hole this this this idea of why
[10:52] why for example why why I use certain
[10:54] patterns of writing and why it's
[10:56] specifically about handwriting this is a
[10:58] very deep Rabbit Hole like um I have
[11:00] this this this uh this uh this
[11:03] background with personal developments if
[11:05] you watch lots of podcasts you know
[11:07] about personal developments you see all
[11:09] the big guys all the big um Alex hosi
[11:13] all all the uh Chris Williamson and all
[11:15] the big guys that talk about personal
[11:16] personal development and I've always had
[11:18] a deep love for personal development I
[11:20] was never the kind of guy I don't want
[11:22] to become a billionaire or I don't want
[11:24] to have hundreds of girlfriends they
[11:26] like they these lowlevel kinds of
[11:27] influencers that say Hey I'm going to
[11:29] teach you how to be rich in five minutes
[11:31] or I'm going to teach you some personal
[11:32] development hacks where you can attract
[11:34] women or something that is part of
[11:36] personal development but what I really
[11:37] like is personal development people that
[11:38] say okay you have a certain life
[11:40] trajectory you have a career you have a
[11:42] family something I'm going to help you
[11:44] to improve yourself and I always had
[11:47] this big conflict in myself for for many
[11:49] many years on the one hand I really love
[11:51] personal development specifically
[11:53] because as I said with the you want to
[11:55] be the change that you want to see in
[11:56] the world I love it because personal
[11:58] development M personal Improvement gives
[12:00] you this responsibility if you have
[12:02] problems in your life it's your your
[12:05] your responsibility to to fix them I
[12:07] really always hated it when people go oh
[12:09] everything is bad it's person XYZ it's
[12:12] it's everybody else's fault I think it's
[12:14] a very good philosophical idea to take
[12:17] responsibility as much as you can like
[12:19] if you get hit by lightning yeah that
[12:21] you can control it but but almost
[12:23] anything else you can do something
[12:24] something about if you get sick you can
[12:26] try to improve your diet and everything
[12:29] if you have money problems you can try
[12:31] to improve your career on the one hand I
[12:33] really really love personal development
[12:35] that's also what's in this in this in
[12:37] this writing because if you know the old
[12:39] style of personal development it's a lot
[12:41] of manifestation a lot of repetition
[12:43] like if you know the old guys like Jim
[12:45] ran Zig Ziggler um Tony Robbins the old
[12:48] guys they were lot about speaking let's
[12:50] say you you are you want to become a
[12:52] very great basketball player then if you
[12:55] speak to actual basketball players or to
[12:57] football players or to ski or to um
[13:01] basketball players or football players
[13:03] or any kind of sports or swimming they
[13:05] do training but they also do
[13:07] manifestation they repeated it what they
[13:09] Bo they repeat it I want to get better I
[13:11] want to get break my record I want to go
[13:13] one second faster I want to be able to
[13:16] to hit a better percentage um I don't
[13:18] believe in magic I don't believe in in
[13:20] astrology I'm I'm not hateful of it but
[13:23] I believe in mathematics and physics
[13:25] that's why that's why we in Bitcoin
[13:26] right we believe in physics we believe
[13:28] in mathem Medics but I also believe in
[13:31] human psychology and I think that
[13:32] personal development personal growth
[13:35] reflecting on your life like all the way
[13:38] until until I found Bitcoin I felt like
[13:40] something was missing in my life and
[13:41] this reflection and and finding
[13:44] something that is missing in your life
[13:45] that is very important but there was
[13:47] always this this big this big disconnect
[13:50] on the one hand I love personal
[13:52] development I love people like you who
[13:53] do podcasts about specific things I
[13:56] really like your podcast as I've told
[13:58] you before
[13:59] but I've also LED podcasts that are spe
[14:01] specifically about personal development
[14:03] but there was always this disconnect on
[14:05] the one hand I love personal development
[14:07] but on the other hand I always loved
[14:08] free markets I loved the idea of free
[14:11] markets and if you read about free
[14:13] markets about mises and all the other
[14:15] people that come after me this Austrian
[14:17] economics and stuff what you read all
[14:19] the time is that they say oh the
[14:21] government is at fault like everything
[14:23] has problems everything is bad and if
[14:25] the government wouldn't intervene then
[14:27] um everything would be better like bitco
[14:29] is the best example like the idea for
[14:30] Bitcoin is the government or like like
[14:33] friedr Hayek that said the government
[14:35] meddled with the money and they they not
[14:37] only froze the development of money they
[14:39] prevented the money from getting better
[14:41] everything else got better but the money
[14:43] was frozen and they made it worse so if
[14:45] you read ausan economics that's like my
[14:47] logical side right in this in this work
[14:49] I'm trying to reflect like my emotional
[14:52] side and my logical side like left brain
[14:54] and right right brain and it's like
[14:57] there was always this conflict on the
[14:58] one hand I said
[14:59] my emotions said I want to be be stop
[15:02] being a whiny little little guy I want
[15:04] to be grow up I want to take
[15:05] responsibility I want to move move
[15:07] forward I want to do personal
[15:08] development I want to tackle my problems
[15:11] tackle my weight tackle my career tackle
[15:14] my my honesty tackle my work ethic like
[15:17] everything you want to you want to
[15:18] improve about yourself on the one hand
[15:20] on the other hand they I have this
[15:21] wonderful intellectual pH philosophy
[15:24] that explains so much I love Austrian
[15:26] economics because it explains so much it
[15:28] explains why Bitcoin is so good it
[15:30] explains the business Cycles it explains
[15:32] why interventionism Works doesn't work I
[15:34] mean um and there was always this
[15:37] conflict because on the one hand I said
[15:38] I want to take total responsibility for
[15:40] my life but my other side said I have to
[15:43] assign blame to the government and like
[15:45] the one side said this and the other
[15:46] side said this and I was like what am I
[15:49] supposed to do and I was like at some
[15:51] point okay I have to make like like a
[15:53] stand I was like it was like um
[15:55] emotionally and logistically it was like
[15:59] like it was like I needed to make a
[16:01] decision and then um I have like this
[16:04] long list of Inspirations because then
[16:06] to go from what I said right now what my
[16:08] plan is with with doing my plan is to to
[16:11] to have my own emotions settled I want
[16:13] to do something that is that combines my
[16:16] my personal development guy uh personal
[16:18] development me the robin that wants to
[16:20] do personal development and the robin
[16:21] that wants to do Austrian economics and
[16:23] I feel like with Bitcoin you can do both
[16:25] if you do Bitcoin it simplifies your
[16:28] life like you know also with Fiat
[16:30] everything is complicated like you you
[16:32] take a job and you you you put money
[16:34] somewhere and it's and it's terrible
[16:36] it's everything you have to become like
[16:38] like like Michael saor said the taxi
[16:40] driver who wants to wants to save for
[16:43] for their retirement he has to become a
[16:45] stock Speculator he to say oh is Apple
[16:48] gonna beat Amazon or is Amazon gonna be
[16:50] beaten by Microsoft it's crazy and with
[16:52] Bitcoin you have this one thing and this
[16:55] this one thing and I have like um so
[16:58] many inspiration it's it's absolutely
[17:00] it's absolutely crazy like um for for
[17:03] doing it like one of the best uh best
[17:06] ways to compare directly is like Mr
[17:08] Beast Everybody Knows Mr Beast he's a
[17:10] very very famous and very very powerful
[17:12] and very uh um hardworking YouTuber and
[17:16] one of the early videos was um I think
[17:19] you probably remember that when he
[17:20] counted to
[17:21] 200,000 I think most people have have
[17:24] heard about that and I was like this is
[17:27] so stupid but it's so so so effective
[17:30] like this is something I want to do but
[17:32] I'm like I'm like uh I want to do it
[17:34] more extreme I basically I want to beat
[17:36] Mr Beast everybody every content creator
[17:38] on YouTube what's your goal you used to
[17:40] want to create Pew beat PewDiePie but
[17:43] now we want to beat Mr Beast and I'm
[17:45] like since I'm not probably not gonna
[17:47] gonna have more explosive shows and and
[17:50] and videos than him I'm probably going
[17:52] to do something that he did but I did it
[17:54] did much more extreme but um Mr beast is
[17:57] just is just one of many many many
[17:58] Inspirations another inspiration is is a
[18:01] very famous famous uh athlete and uh and
[18:05] personal development speaker David
[18:06] gogins David gogins is a very very very
[18:09] famous guy I think everybody who is on
[18:11] Twitter X knows G David gogins he has
[18:13] liked the story where he where he was
[18:16] like uh in in a life situation little
[18:20] bit like me but but but much more
[18:22] extreme he had like I think everybody
[18:24] had like growing ad had certain had
[18:26] certain phases of depression or certain
[18:28] pH of oh what am I doing with my life I
[18:30] can't do anything um but for me it was
[18:33] never clinical I never never went as far
[18:35] as he he did David gogin was is he's
[18:38] still alive obviously he was born in a
[18:41] in a in a wealthy neighborhood but his
[18:43] father abused him incredibly much and he
[18:45] had all this psychological baggage he
[18:47] had he had such such huge inner demons
[18:49] he was like he was like totally broken
[18:51] as a man and he say says like I'm so
[18:54] broken as a person the only way to get
[18:56] out is to go extreme that is something
[18:59] that I really really as I said I don't I
[19:02] have wonderful parents my parents are
[19:03] absolutely crazy good um but but for me
[19:07] the Depression was not about myself or
[19:08] my parents or my my my um my immediate
[19:11] surrounding my depression was always
[19:12] about the world about things you see
[19:14] wars in the world you see economic
[19:17] problems you see people being poor
[19:19] people being being uh being um being
[19:21] harassed by their regimes or killed
[19:23] that's what always depressed me like I
[19:25] was never the guy like David Goin that
[19:26] said oh my God I as a person I am so
[19:29] broken I am so terrible I have to reform
[19:31] myself I was always about the world but
[19:33] the way David ggens describes this I
[19:35] think many bitcoiners can relate to
[19:37] because he describes this enormous
[19:39] enormous um obstacle for us bitcoiners
[19:42] this enormous enormous obstacle is
[19:44] trying to displace Fiat by whatever
[19:46] means we will do it in the end but we
[19:48] try to displace Fiat and we try to put
[19:50] Bitcoin on its place but to me this is
[19:53] very very similar to the way David
[19:55] gogins is is trying has tried to fight
[19:57] his own inner struggle to go out of
[20:00] poverty out of out of being dyslexic out
[20:03] of being uneducated out of feeling like
[20:05] he's a total failure to me this old
[20:08] David gogin that he tried to to to kill
[20:11] to slaughter and to replace by this new
[20:13] persona that he made gogin to me this is
[20:16] like the Fiat system and his his idea
[20:18] was life is very difficult if you want
[20:21] to do something in your life it's very
[20:22] very very very difficult I myself I have
[20:25] worked several jobs I'm not a big CEO
[20:27] I'm not a big manager I'm not I I am
[20:30] myself don't have any capacity to
[20:31] lecture about other people but I talk to
[20:33] many many very successful people I talk
[20:35] to self-made millionaires very very big
[20:38] company CEOs who had everything who had
[20:40] all the education all the ivy league or
[20:42] the European equivalent of the ivy
[20:44] league sometimes the direct ivy league
[20:45] when they go to America they had
[20:47] everything and they told me they told me
[20:49] like um doing something getting to this
[20:52] position and doing my job is incredibly
[20:53] incredibly difficult like if you have
[20:56] the ambition like David gogin to do
[20:58] something that is that is really really
[21:00] really very difficult you have to work
[21:02] incredibly incredibly hard you have to
[21:04] really really torture yourself and this
[21:07] is what he did if you read I recommend
[21:08] everybody David gogin is not a bitcoiner
[21:10] and I don't want to put any words in his
[21:11] mouth but he's an incredibly incredibly
[21:14] good practical philosopher I would
[21:16] recommend everybody to buy his book or
[21:17] at least listen to The Joe Rogan podcast
[21:20] because he's like um you have to grow up
[21:23] we live in this Society in this Fiat
[21:25] Society specifically I would say where
[21:27] everybody tries to to Shield you from
[21:30] from harm like that's what that's like
[21:33] um I think I think Milton Freedman said
[21:35] it like if you put Fiat into a system
[21:37] it's like it's like uh you are putting
[21:39] drugs into somebody you you put
[21:41] anesthesia into somebody you take the
[21:43] pain away and that is the wrong wrong
[21:45] way in my opinion we can learn we as
[21:47] bitcoiners learn from David go that we
[21:48] have to go through towards pain like
[21:51] people cannot appreciate what it means
[21:53] to write Bitcoin um 300,000 times so far
[21:56] I have written it 313,000 times and and
[21:59] something right now um within a span of
[22:02] about 10 months so I write about a
[22:04] thousand words per per day because I'm
[22:07] working full-time right now so um
[22:09] writing thousand words words a day right
[22:11] now is pretty good like like a good
[22:13] writer does about that if you're like a
[22:15] novelist if you're like a professional
[22:16] novelist who does this full-time I work
[22:19] full-time so writing a thousand words a
[22:20] day is pretty difficult um if you are
[22:23] like a super duper hardcore novelist
[22:25] like like the best of the best like the
[22:27] best most prolific novelist list you
[22:29] write like 2,500 words a day and that's
[22:31] like my goal if I can become like
[22:32] Brandon serson the famous author and
[22:34] write 2,500 words then it's it's more
[22:37] likely that I'm gonna survive this thing
[22:39] but yeah the idea of David gorgens is
[22:41] like the idea that it can give everybody
[22:43] it can give to you to anybody is if you
[22:46] want to really make something at a World
[22:48] level you have to be extreme like if you
[22:50] watch the the the the interviews of
[22:52] Chris Williamson Alex hosi they have
[22:55] Chris Williamson the other guys Lex
[22:56] Freedman whatever they have they have
[22:59] interviewed hundreds and hundreds and
[23:01] hundreds of guests they interviewed the
[23:02] cream of the crop they interviewed Elon
[23:04] Musk they interviewed anybody and the
[23:07] best of the best they interviewed Kobe
[23:08] Bryan the best people say if you want to
[23:11] do something you have to be really
[23:13] really committed you have to be really
[23:15] crazy you have to be really really crazy
[23:17] and my idea is like I am a writer it's
[23:19] in my DNA like if you slice me open like
[23:22] writing is in my da I remember my my
[23:24] mother teaching me writing back then and
[23:27] I always remembered like like uh
[23:29] mathematics like doing all the
[23:30] multiplication tables and everything I
[23:32] was like always ah what's this but when
[23:34] she taught me how to write the letters I
[23:36] I I remember it like it was today um I
[23:39] remember it like the first time I I I
[23:41] heard about Bitcoin basically these are
[23:42] like the two fundamental things that
[23:44] influenced me in my life my mother
[23:46] teaching me writing and me learning
[23:48] about Bitcoin I can remember the letters
[23:50] and I was like this is something I'm
[23:51] going to do but that's the second
[23:54] problem um if you know that you're going
[23:57] to do something you have have to do it
[23:59] and this is something where where a lot
[24:01] of people struggle um especially with
[24:03] Bitcoin if somebody ask me yeah I want
[24:05] to do something with Bitcoin I I'm not
[24:07] sure I want to do this that then do it
[24:09] like the problem is the Fiat system
[24:12] trains you to ask for permission that's
[24:14] the problem like I'm I don't say break
[24:16] the law I'm not somebody somebody that
[24:18] says it's smart to break the law because
[24:19] the if you break the law that says
[24:21] stupid you just ruining your own life
[24:23] but you don't have to break the law if
[24:25] you for example if you like somebody and
[24:27] you want to ask them out ask hey do you
[24:29] want to want to have a date with me or
[24:30] something or if you want to think about
[24:33] let's say you want to switch careers
[24:35] then people ask me yeah I'm I'm afraid
[24:37] to quit my job and I'm afraid to look
[24:39] into this career yeah then look into it
[24:41] like like this is like I'm 37 years old
[24:44] right now Robin I I I wasted so many
[24:46] years where I could have been doing this
[24:49] like basically all all really really
[24:51] good um personal developments all really
[24:53] good life philosophers all really really
[24:56] powerful philosophers was about people
[24:58] that either said yes I'm going to do it
[25:01] or people that said oh my God should I
[25:03] do it and they wor for 20 years like me
[25:05] and in the end they say I shouldn't have
[25:06] worried for 20 years like if you have
[25:08] all the all the super successful people
[25:10] Elon Musk for example he knew that he
[25:13] was going to be an engineer and he was
[25:14] going to be a big big uh business person
[25:17] and his engineering business would
[25:18] change the world you can have all kinds
[25:19] of opinion about Elon Musk I've talked
[25:21] about many free market guys they
[25:22] criticize Elon Musk for this that and
[25:24] the other that's that's all fine I'm not
[25:26] goingon to goingon to sanctify I don't
[25:27] think you should put any human being on
[25:29] a pedestal and say this this person is
[25:30] Holy and um if I ever get successful in
[25:34] the next 20 years with this I don't want
[25:35] people to put me on a pedestal I think
[25:37] anybody can do it anybody can do
[25:39] anything they want um and uh but you
[25:42] have to do it it's really it's really it
[25:44] sounds stupid but but the first first
[25:47] step is always 80% of the energy if you
[25:50] have a big problem like say um you want
[25:53] to change your relationship you want to
[25:55] want to learn a new skill you want to
[25:56] learn a new language you want to learn
[25:57] mathematics you want to learn physics
[25:59] you want to learn Bitcoin you want to
[26:00] you want to learn how to become a
[26:01] Bitcoin core developer you want to want
[26:03] to apply to blockstream and work on
[26:06] their block spr liquid and you have to
[26:07] learn this language and that language
[26:09] many per people they say oh I have this
[26:11] job and I hate this job and I I I uh
[26:14] don't do much at my job but because I I
[26:16] hate it so much I yeah then do something
[26:19] with your job and after the job do
[26:20] something else that's like um that's a
[26:23] real big psychological thing that's
[26:25] really really deep and I have I have so
[26:28] many many different Inspirations for
[26:30] this another big inspiration is is
[26:32] gaming I've always been very big in
[26:34] gaming not so much in playing video
[26:35] games I've played a lot of video games
[26:37] but I've always admired people who do
[26:39] big things in video games like I I told
[26:41] you about um about um about Mr Beast
[26:45] already before I discovered Mr Beast
[26:47] there was already PewDiePie and every
[26:48] every content creator everybody who
[26:50] tried Twitch streaming or YouTube
[26:52] PewDiePie was always the great thing and
[26:55] if older people they say ah video gaming
[26:58] why why can this be good in my opinion
[26:59] it's it's very good it's a very good
[27:01] very good medium but it's also a way for
[27:03] self-development if you look at like the
[27:05] really really big video gaming people
[27:07] like like right shroud or some some
[27:09] people like the really big gaming I
[27:12] think gaming is a very very big thing
[27:14] and I see that for example Bitcoin and
[27:16] gaming they will have a future but um
[27:19] I'm not specifically I'm I don't want to
[27:21] propose any specific links between
[27:23] gaming and Bitcoin I'm not like I want
[27:25] to make an altcoin that that is used for
[27:26] my game or something I just draw a lot
[27:29] of inspiration from um from gaming for
[27:32] it like I watch a lot of uh RuneScape
[27:34] players old school runes spap this is
[27:36] old school RuneScape is such a hilarious
[27:38] game old school RuneScape for those
[27:39] people who don't know it it's it's a
[27:41] very very old game like World of
[27:43] Warcraft but it's very very old and it's
[27:45] very very bad Graphics but what those
[27:48] people did they that inspir inspired me
[27:51] like nothing else that inspired me like
[27:52] nothing else because these people say
[27:55] okay you can play this game and uh as I
[27:58] said this inspired me like this is so
[28:00] weird but this inspired me for for
[28:02] specifically what I'm doing they they
[28:04] say okay playing the normal game is not
[28:06] difficult enough it's not repetitive and
[28:07] normally RuneScape is the most
[28:09] repetitive game you can ever imagine you
[28:12] like walk your character with a mouse to
[28:14] a tree you click the tree your character
[28:16] chops the tree the tree is chopped you
[28:19] go to the next tree you chop it then the
[28:21] first tree has regrown and you chop it
[28:22] again and after a while you take your
[28:24] blocks you you bring them to a bank and
[28:26] you start chopping again or if you want
[28:28] to be really fancy you drop the locks on
[28:30] the ground and you start chopping again
[28:31] but because you get experience points
[28:33] for for um for chopping this lock but
[28:36] you can also kill dragons it's like a
[28:38] fantasy RPG but the the insane thing is
[28:41] there are a few people that I admire
[28:43] almost more than any other content
[28:45] creators they are they are runes scap
[28:47] players one of them is called is called
[28:49] settled another guy is called ver and
[28:52] another one is called uh uim Mudkip
[28:55] these people they do the most crazy
[28:57] things like people will say I'm crazy
[28:59] but but everybody who who who thinks I'm
[29:01] lying I'm making this up you can look it
[29:03] up on YouTube settled like the word
[29:05] settled Mudkip like the Pokemon Mudkip
[29:08] or ver um like like just type UI in ver
[29:13] and and you find him and what they do is
[29:15] they have specific restricted accounts
[29:17] like everybody who's a little bit into
[29:18] video gaming you know what rest
[29:19] restricted accounts are restricted you
[29:21] can restrict yourself to anything you
[29:23] can say I want to play the game without
[29:24] certain benefits I want to fight the
[29:26] bosses but I'm only going to use certain
[29:28] weapons and what these guys are doing is
[29:30] they make accounts and they make
[29:32] extremely extremely extremely tight
[29:34] restrictions for example um settled made
[29:37] an account that forced him to only play
[29:40] in one region of the game and um the the
[29:43] game it's like in Warra Warcraft in
[29:45] Warcraft you have different games you
[29:46] have to Alliance countries you have to
[29:47] all countries but in this RuneScape game
[29:50] the the areas are called differently one
[29:52] are is called morania and yet this one
[29:54] area morania said I want to achieve the
[29:56] highest possible boss kill I want to
[29:59] kill the highest possible B in that area
[30:01] but I'm only allowed to play in that
[30:02] area only allowed to get experience in
[30:05] that area and only allowed to kill
[30:06] monsters in that area and only allowed
[30:08] to collect equipment there and this cost
[30:10] him to to work about two years on this
[30:13] one thing and I and he was doing the
[30:15] same thing all the time he was doing he
[30:17] was live streaming and he making YouTube
[30:18] videos he he was like doing he was like
[30:21] uh usually you for example you take coal
[30:24] and you take coal to your bank and
[30:25] that's it but he had no Bank he had a
[30:26] restricted account without the bank and
[30:28] he was doing it in one area and he had
[30:30] to to to mine like a little inventory of
[30:33] coal because the inventory was F filled
[30:35] with other stuff because he had he has
[30:36] no Bank he had everything in his
[30:37] inventory he was walking for 15 minutes
[30:40] he was processing this one inventory and
[30:42] it had to had to walk back so he had
[30:44] basically doing the same thing for two
[30:45] years straight I was like yes and he has
[30:48] like he has like
[30:49] 250,000 thousand um thousand uh
[30:52] subscribers on YouTube I'm like I'm not
[30:54] crazy doing the same thing over and over
[30:56] again like Mr Beast
[30:58] this is something there's a market for
[30:59] that there's a market market for doing
[31:02] crazy things and I'm like I want to do
[31:03] that like also like settled I'm not
[31:06] doing the same thing over and over again
[31:08] like like settled there's variation if
[31:10] you look through my my Twitter um I I
[31:13] vary my thing I have different colors
[31:15] different things I'm in my my spare time
[31:18] I'm I'm looking at drafting I want to
[31:19] make paintings I want to I want to make
[31:21] um for all these people um who who are
[31:24] into Bitcoin obviously everybody should
[31:26] follow should follow frile encrypt the
[31:28] the Bitcoin artist he made the he made
[31:31] the um the big uh statue for Michael
[31:34] sailor whenever Michael sailor has like
[31:36] his his his speech he has like this this
[31:38] fractile encrypt um um note note statue
[31:41] behind him he's he's a genius I want
[31:43] everybody to follow him and also to to
[31:45] to support him buying his stuff and also
[31:48] the German bit the German bitcoiner um
[31:50] Apex Bitcoin Who does these drawings Who
[31:53] does these these Bitcoin drawings I'm
[31:55] like when I saw it it was like a
[31:56] revelation like I'm not a religious
[31:58] person um I I I I don't condemn religion
[32:01] I'm not I'm not not like I I hate
[32:03] religion or anything I know he has
[32:05] religious religious context some of them
[32:08] like like like the patas and and these
[32:10] and these images that can come from
[32:12] Christianity but that for me it was a
[32:14] revelation not religious Revelation like
[32:16] I'm super excited to announce that this
[32:19] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[32:23] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[32:27] they teach and preach self custody this
[32:29] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[32:33] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[32:35] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[32:39] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[32:41] time support this podcast use code Robin
[32:44] and click the link in the description
[32:46] you can do this and you can do this in a
[32:48] way that really provides value to people
[32:51] like I don't know if people are ever
[32:53] going to give me money for what what for
[32:54] what I do I don't know but I see this
[32:56] guy and he tells us like life story and
[32:58] he he came from from very humble
[33:00] beginnings he worked like in a
[33:01] supermarket I know what he was like a
[33:03] supermarket shift supervisor so nothing
[33:05] nothing special everything all right
[33:07] nothing nothing bad nothing nothing
[33:09] nothing extreme and he started doing
[33:11] what he left he said he he lefted
[33:13] working with Bitcoin but but he found
[33:15] this as his out his creative outlet and
[33:18] I I wish more people would do that I
[33:20] wish more people would go and and use
[33:22] their passion to um to to go about it
[33:26] that's like one of the major maor
[33:28] influences another ma major influence is
[33:30] like is like ver and again I don't want
[33:32] to put these these these old school
[33:34] RuneScape you can check out their
[33:36] content but I don't want to connect them
[33:37] to bitcoin they have nothing to do with
[33:39] Bitcoin theyve never endorsed Bitcoin I
[33:41] never given them Bitcoin they have never
[33:42] given me Bitcoin they have nothing to do
[33:43] with I'm just quoting them as an
[33:45] inspiration so so not as to put any
[33:47] words into their mouth the other guy is
[33:49] yui M ver and he plays like like an Iron
[33:52] Man that is that is even more restricted
[33:55] he doesn't restrict himself to an area
[33:57] he DCT himself to a chunk chunks are
[33:59] basically the little thing like if you
[34:01] play Minecraft chunks are like the thing
[34:03] that make up your area and he plays like
[34:05] in this one little chunk and he has to
[34:07] make all the achievements happen in this
[34:10] chunk before he can move to the next he
[34:12] does have a bank because he's just an
[34:14] Iron Man but he's so extremely
[34:15] restricted that it's even more
[34:16] repetitive and what he did was um he had
[34:20] to kill one type of Boss monster for one
[34:23] and a half years straight one and a half
[34:26] years this person and he also has over
[34:28] 100,000 followers he has like good
[34:30] income he is like he has much more
[34:32] successful than than 19 90% of all the
[34:34] YouTubers he killed this one monster and
[34:36] he live streamed and people showed up
[34:38] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[34:39] people and they all there let me
[34:41] subscribe to you let me let me uh cheer
[34:44] your bits let me give you money and all
[34:45] the other ways that you can support
[34:47] people on Twitch and it's like I want to
[34:49] do that I want to go on Twitch and do
[34:51] this writing I have a twitch Channel
[34:53] already it's linked on my on my YouTube
[34:56] um already but currently I'm not um
[34:59] currently I'm not um uh streaming on
[35:01] Twitch right now because currently my
[35:04] idea is um I have tried Twitch streaming
[35:07] under many many different contexts and
[35:10] usually it was just to test the medium
[35:11] because I'm so excited about this medium
[35:13] because I think it's so cool to do
[35:15] something to stream something um and
[35:16] people can interact with you live that's
[35:19] why Always I'm I'm uh every Sunday I'm
[35:21] in the German Bitcoin space the stsh
[35:24] because I think it's so cool that the
[35:25] internet makes it possible for for
[35:27] people
[35:28] to go together and to share their
[35:30] interests and to talk to each other so
[35:32] that's I always did a lot of twitch I
[35:35] have lots of friends on Twitch lots of
[35:36] people I talk to but I'm currently not
[35:38] streaming because my idea is I'm trying
[35:40] to focus on the thing I'm trying to
[35:42] build this thing up and my idea is um I
[35:45] don't want to another thing that people
[35:48] may ask when they view this ask
[35:50] themselves when they view this podcast
[35:51] or when they when they look at my or
[35:53] look at my my Twitter X account they say
[35:56] is this guy does this guy think he's
[35:58] like like some kind of super artist some
[36:00] Superstar and that he thinks he's so
[36:02] great and people are supposed to worship
[36:04] him or give him attention no I believe
[36:06] in the free market and I believe in
[36:07] Merit I've spent about um 500 hours so
[36:11] far give and take a few hours I haven't
[36:13] counted every single hour I'm writing
[36:14] because sometimes you just eat something
[36:16] or write a podcast and you're writing
[36:17] and it is it really an hour worked is it
[36:19] not an hour worked sometimes I sit there
[36:21] listen to music and write but um I don't
[36:23] want to people to think yeah I I I want
[36:26] everybody to give me tons of money
[36:27] everybody could this is very realistic
[36:30] that this podcast is the only thing I
[36:31] ever do in public with any podcast I
[36:34] ever and nothing is ever going to happen
[36:36] to it and that's okay my opinion is we
[36:38] don't allow ourselves to fail enough
[36:40] like like real creativity there's this
[36:42] there's this old poem by Kur vud Kur vug
[36:45] good is a very very famous writer
[36:47] obviously if you into writing you know
[36:49] some of the very famous writer again I
[36:51] don't want to endorse Kur vug good he's
[36:53] he has socialistic Tendencies he has
[36:54] this that and the other I don't want to
[36:56] go in I don't want to debate person's
[36:58] Merit but he has this wonderful quote
[37:00] that really also influenced me long
[37:02] before I know about um Austrian
[37:04] economics and everything that but it
[37:05] influenced my life he said like um
[37:08] sometimes you feel like your soul is
[37:09] just not growing like you're doing stuff
[37:12] and you're not going forward and your
[37:13] soul is you feel like you're doing stuff
[37:15] you're going through the emotion but you
[37:17] feel like inwardly you are going
[37:18] backwards outwardly you have you have a
[37:21] job you have you have obligations you
[37:23] have friends family everything but
[37:25] inwardly you feel like you're going back
[37:27] backwards and then uh he said just sit
[37:30] down write a poem write it to the best
[37:32] of your abilities put really some some
[37:34] sweat I don't know the exact wording but
[37:36] I think he said he put really some sweat
[37:37] into it and then just put it to a side
[37:40] and if it doesn't come up if nobody asks
[37:42] you about it then it's okay so for me if
[37:45] I do this 21 million Bitcoin if I spend
[37:47] spend decades and decades and Decades of
[37:50] my life doing it and nobody cares for
[37:51] that's okay and that's that's like my
[37:53] message to you that's not loading my
[37:55] message to you right now as my as my um
[37:57] as my uh interviewer in this podcast and
[38:01] not putting it to anybody who listens to
[38:02] it but even if like if like the world
[38:04] the world gets hit by an asteroid and
[38:06] and Hyper bit conization is delayed by
[38:08] this asteroid and like 150 years later
[38:10] we are at current at current technology
[38:12] and people somehow go through the Ravel
[38:15] and when they when they look for all the
[38:17] full notes from Bitcoin that are buried
[38:19] and among the full notes some of the
[38:21] Bitcoin had has like podcasts on like a
[38:23] hard drive and he finds the Robin S
[38:25] podcast and he and he looks oh there
[38:27] this Rob guy and maybe in the future
[38:29] they have found my found my um my my
[38:32] stuff and I said oh this is really
[38:33] curious maybe I am by accident I'm one
[38:36] of the few Bitcoin artists that are like
[38:39] maybe everything else got burned and
[38:40] they find my stuff and they're like hey
[38:42] this this is like pretty weird and and
[38:45] if you listen to this um don't don't ask
[38:48] for permission too much like this is how
[38:50] we get into this problem asking for
[38:51] permission too much saying like oh um oh
[38:55] uh maybe maybe my government will not
[38:57] like me if I hold Bitcoin yeah your
[38:58] government is certainly not going to
[38:59] like you if you if you don't if you hold
[39:01] Bitcoin I'm not saying to you go out
[39:03] there and break the law I'm not going to
[39:05] tell you um go to your neighbor and buy
[39:08] his car for for for one and a half
[39:11] Bitcoin or for half Bitcoin or whatever
[39:14] the price is is higher right now and
[39:16] then then post on it on on the internet
[39:18] say hey I I bought a bought a car for
[39:20] Bitcoin and I'm happy I evaded texes and
[39:22] here's my address and here's everything
[39:24] we did no I'm just saying don't go out
[39:27] of your ask for permission it's legal
[39:28] Bitcoin has no legal obstacle to just
[39:30] buying and holding it so just don't
[39:32] don't hold back back so much like
[39:34] everybody is is so afraid and I'm sorry
[39:38] and every everybody like like also when
[39:40] you're in traditional investing like
[39:42] it's crazy like like I'm like like when
[39:44] you when you when you look looking at my
[39:46] words I've written the word Bitcoin
[39:48] 313,000 times why am I doing this
[39:51] because I'm going crazy because I'm
[39:52] saying the same words over and over
[39:54] again I just want to rip rip them out of
[39:56] my head and just throw it at people
[39:59] non-violently but throw it at them at
[40:01] them saying them no I'm not some Noob
[40:04] I'm I'm convinced like like Michael saor
[40:06] said what you need to do I've I've
[40:08] watched your as I told you I've watched
[40:10] your podcast I've I've seen you put more
[40:12] and more podcasts out and I see you they
[40:14] they're not just just thrown out there
[40:16] you really you really put them out you
[40:18] you select very good guests you select
[40:20] guests that I would personally admire
[40:21] not every single one but but but those
[40:24] that I manag to view I really admire
[40:26] them you you you have to be convinced
[40:28] but you wouldn't do it you wouldn't put
[40:29] you put your name there Robin Robin S um
[40:33] and and you have to be convinced like
[40:35] you can't do anything if you're not
[40:36] convinced it's it's you have to have
[40:38] some I'm more of the fire guy like like
[40:41] in in um in the spaces on Saturday I'm
[40:44] not the best I'm not the best explaining
[40:47] code to you I can explain to you the
[40:48] high level concept of Bitcoin but but uh
[40:51] but I have friends and acquaintances and
[40:53] other people on Twitter X and somewhere
[40:55] that are much much better if if somebody
[40:57] has a very very complicated um question
[40:59] I say refer to this guy he is he is so
[41:01] smart or better not better yet refer to
[41:03] some this guy has written about but
[41:05] because most people who are really good
[41:07] about the technology of Bitcoin they
[41:09] really also have written something very
[41:11] smart about most topics that you can
[41:12] think of like why is it stupid to to
[41:15] massively increase the block size what
[41:16] is the deal with how does mining work
[41:18] hashing work whatever but I'm more of
[41:21] the emotion guy like if I go on podcast
[41:24] I want to put my emotion out there and
[41:26] um and um I get always get this binary
[41:29] response like a binary response either
[41:31] the one side or the other side and some
[41:33] people they look at my work and say he's
[41:36] crazy like like at the first first first
[41:39] when I when I breached 100,000 words
[41:41] written in the first couple of month
[41:43] people were like yeah that's that's some
[41:45] gag at the second month uh at the second
[41:48] uh second um Milestone at 200,000 words
[41:52] people were like okay what and right now
[41:56] the the response I get it's either
[41:57] binary he's crazy he's sick he's a
[41:59] psychopath he's autistic he's he's
[42:02] mentally Disturbed he needs a doctor he
[42:04] needs to um and it's like it's like I
[42:07] feel like people are so so used to
[42:09] asking permission that if they view this
[42:12] this crazy colorful bird out there that
[42:14] is that does not fit their scheme they
[42:16] always say like this person has to be
[42:17] crazy like like um like if you talk to
[42:21] to to to older people and say hey maybe
[42:23] the government being being so being so
[42:26] so in control of your money deciding
[42:29] what you can do or not do with with your
[42:31] money if you want to send money
[42:32] somewhere you have to ask your bank
[42:34] please send the money because if you go
[42:36] to your bank and you you click like uh
[42:38] send the money then it doesn't say yeah
[42:39] it's send it said it's send it says like
[42:42] it's it's it's been been taken it's been
[42:45] like yeah maybe we do it maybe we won't
[42:47] and if you question it people people go
[42:49] nuts they say what are you are you crazy
[42:52] money like like even economists like
[42:55] like German Economist Hans vanaz
[42:57] again I don't want to do character
[42:59] assass assassination I don't want to
[43:00] slander anybody that's not my style my
[43:02] style is not to to beat somebody down I
[43:04] think hansv has had many many good
[43:05] points he is one of the few mainstream
[43:08] economists that from time to time says
[43:10] yeah maybe we shouldn't increase our our
[43:12] our um government debt and inflation
[43:14] like crazy maybe that's not a good idea
[43:16] but but he was asked um by somebody I
[43:19] don't know remember if it's a Bitcoin or
[43:20] like yeah Mr Zin you're you're so so
[43:22] wise and you're so accomplished and you
[43:24] have warned politicians and people so
[43:26] much of inflation but why about bitco
[43:28] Bitcoin and he's like no no no no
[43:30] Bitcoin has to be in the hunter status
[43:32] in the hand of the government it's like
[43:34] it's like this idea to ask permission to
[43:37] ask permission to do something it's so
[43:39] it it reminds you like like like when
[43:41] Satoshi made made this Genesis block and
[43:43] this and this it's so so so reminiscent
[43:46] of of the Reformation the religious
[43:47] Reformation because it reminds you so
[43:49] much of when people were in the Middle
[43:51] Ages and they had to permission what to
[43:53] think like like my wife is sick you had
[43:55] to ask your your your priest yeah my
[43:57] wife is sick is this is this um a
[44:01] punishment from God is this a challenge
[44:03] from God um if this is a punishment from
[44:06] God is this something that that that
[44:08] that I can deal with you can I pay you
[44:10] money if I can pay you money can I do
[44:12] you have and and if I can pay you money
[44:14] is it okay for my heart they were
[44:16] talking about their own heart not just
[44:17] that they were they were asking in their
[44:19] heart what am I allowed to believe like
[44:21] okay I'm going to pay your money you're
[44:23] my priest and am I allowed to believe in
[44:25] my heart if my wife is sick or not and
[44:28] today we would say no you're not
[44:29] supposed to to to to ask somebody what
[44:31] to believe you're supposed to ask
[44:33] science you're supposed to look at at
[44:35] vikkipedia and and and the doctors and
[44:37] say what specialist can I bring my wife
[44:38] to to find a scientific answer to her
[44:40] ailment and that's what we do with
[44:42] Bitcoin we don't ask permission for the
[44:44] government what we can do and what we
[44:46] what we cannot do with our money we we
[44:48] we asked science we asked Wikipedia and
[44:50] then we asked as Google and then we ask
[44:52] ask um after we have found all the
[44:55] different things we research it and then
[44:57] we we look at look at what the what the
[45:00] right position is and that is what I
[45:01] want more people to do to to go for it
[45:03] because because um a thing that that
[45:07] David gogin also said that is very true
[45:08] is is um there's a lot of suffering in
[45:11] life like like this is nothing new if I
[45:13] say say to you there's lot of suffering
[45:15] in life I'm not I'm not Disturbed you
[45:17] don't need to call call some mental
[45:19] institution if I say my life has
[45:20] suffering your life is suffering I think
[45:22] that's normal and David ggan says then
[45:25] bring it on David ggens GG is really
[45:27] really he has like like experienced the
[45:30] most amount of suffering possible like
[45:32] like if you read about David goin's um
[45:35] David goin's uh challenges when he when
[45:37] he was trying to go from being this
[45:39] absolutely crazy Navy Seal Seal went
[45:43] through three hell weeks went through
[45:45] the worst possible training with the
[45:46] worst possible injuries in the worst
[45:48] possible kind of repetition the worst
[45:50] possible weather possible he went from
[45:51] that to becoming an ultra Runner and you
[45:53] read his his his his uh his story of how
[45:57] of how what his body looked like like he
[45:58] was literally dying like his body was
[46:00] dissolving like his organs were
[46:01] dissolving blood was I can't even talk
[46:04] about it with without it being being too
[46:06] gruesome his whole body was dissolving
[46:08] he was like he was literally dying and
[46:10] he was going he he went he said he went
[46:11] through the worst possible pain like
[46:14] there's this when you go through a
[46:15] doctor and I think either when you're
[46:17] pregnant or when you inj there there's
[46:18] like this Pain Scale you said that he
[46:20] was at the maximum pain skill he said
[46:21] like and that's okay he said like pain
[46:23] is part of life I have experienced all
[46:25] the pain necessary and if you listen to
[46:27] this podcast if you are out there your
[46:30] pain your pain is something like
[46:32] obviously David ggens also said it
[46:34] obviously if you have some recurrent
[46:37] psychological psychological issue you
[46:39] should obviously talk to people you
[46:40] should not put the pain inside of
[46:42] yourself you should seek medical help
[46:44] always but what what his lecture is that
[46:47] no matter what you do even if you have
[46:48] the best psychologist everything is okay
[46:50] the diagnose you you are completely
[46:52] healthy you're still going to have
[46:53] challenges it's still going to be
[46:55] painful it's still going to you don't
[46:57] want to be like David ggens you don't
[46:58] want to let your life go so much into
[47:00] the ruin that only massive massive
[47:02] massive action can get you out of it but
[47:05] his idea is like life is full of pain
[47:07] and you should use that pain you should
[47:09] you should you you should use negative
[47:11] emotions like for me I was so depressed
[47:13] during many parts of my life so
[47:15] depressed and again it was not because
[47:17] I'm just a human being I realized I'm a
[47:19] human being I'm flawed if I do something
[47:21] maybe nobody cares about it that's okay
[47:23] but my my my sadness comes from the
[47:25] world not working like what drives me
[47:27] crazy is when you see economists like
[47:29] Hans vazin or many other people who are
[47:31] so smart should should know the answer
[47:33] and they just want to want to throw this
[47:35] at their face and say no you have not
[47:37] done the work I have done the work they
[47:39] say they they go like like like the
[47:41] Jamie Diamond response I don't talk to
[47:43] me about Bitcoin I'm like yes I want to
[47:45] talk to you about Bitcoin when I am one
[47:47] of the millions of people around the
[47:49] whole world like Bitcoin Bitcoin has
[47:51] recently gone into into uh 1 billion uh
[47:54] one trillion 1,000 billion 1 trillion
[47:57] Doll Market piap again like like this is
[47:59] not something where you say as a banker
[48:01] as one of the most powerful banking
[48:02] people on planet Earth this is not where
[48:04] you say no I don't want to talk to about
[48:06] Bitcoin my message is yes I want to talk
[48:08] about Bitcoin and I'm not going to stop
[48:10] like David Gan says I'm not going to
[48:12] stop and just to finish this one point
[48:14] um there's this binary thing when people
[48:17] view my post obviously many people look
[48:19] at my post and don't know what it is
[48:20] they they click on there's lots of
[48:21] content like right now um I'm not
[48:24] special but I believe if I do it for
[48:26] many years if I go into millions of
[48:27] words at some point I will be special at
[48:29] least in a sense I've had the world
[48:30] record in this thing then objectively
[48:33] I've done something that I at least can
[48:34] be proud of but as I said there's this
[48:36] one one um part of people um that really
[48:41] uh they look at my stuff and they say
[48:43] you're crazy you're ill stop doing that
[48:45] they misunderstand but the other people
[48:47] and it makes me so happy it makes me so
[48:49] happy like like like somebody who you
[48:52] play music your whole year everybody
[48:53] tells you you can do be a musician
[48:55] everybody tells you you need to do this
[48:57] that and the other and you always ask
[48:58] permission like I did for 20 years or
[49:00] you can't be a writer you have to Just
[49:01] Disagree you can't be a writer you have
[49:03] to read 700 novels and books about this
[49:07] you can't be a writer you can't be this
[49:08] if for example if you're a musician
[49:10] everybody tells you no you have to be an
[49:11] encounter you can't be a musician and
[49:13] you play and some people genuinely like
[49:14] your stuff and they genely say yes yes
[49:17] Robin um you you have just started like
[49:19] say you like me you have you have played
[49:21] your musical instrument for 10 months
[49:23] and somebody let's say a musician says
[49:24] yes I really see you can do cool stuff I
[49:27] really think this this this m this song
[49:28] you have written or this song You've
[49:30] interpreted this is really good then
[49:31] this is like Priceless you can't change
[49:33] this for anything this is like the
[49:35] second kind of people that uh react to
[49:37] my cont the First Co said like you're
[49:40] crazy you're sick you're ill go seek
[49:42] help stop doing that I'm basically
[49:44] saying I'm offended at you that and the
[49:46] other people say they snipped their
[49:47] fingers said I got it like just with
[49:50] David Garg the same thing some people
[49:52] look at this guy and they see this guy
[49:54] who is like the most broken and
[49:55] destroyed person had nothing going for
[49:57] him and he started fighting he started
[49:59] going up like like we Bitcoin are
[50:01] sometimes here sometimes you feel like
[50:03] you're broken you're defeated your
[50:04] Banker says I'm going to block your
[50:06] transition you your best friends say to
[50:08] you you're crazy I don't want to hear
[50:10] about this Bitcoin the the people you
[50:12] spend you the people you spend your
[50:14] blood Blood Sweat and Tears on trying to
[50:16] convince them they say no I think I
[50:18] think they they sell to you not directly
[50:20] because people hate being direct but but
[50:22] direct but indirectly you say I think
[50:24] you're a loser I think you're wasting
[50:26] your time I think you're are spending we
[50:28] bitcoiners if you're crazy if you're a
[50:30] serious Bitcoin you spend thousands and
[50:32] thousands of hours and what they say to
[50:33] usou are crazy you're bitcoiners you are
[50:36] crazy I heard about this other thing
[50:37] even better I heard about this other
[50:39] coin it's going to win because I heard
[50:41] about it for five minutes this other
[50:42] other coin um it's going to it's going
[50:44] to kill Bitcoin and some people they
[50:46] just snip their fingers and say I got it
[50:48] some of them are bitcoiners but what's
[50:51] even even cooler in my opinion because
[50:53] some bitcoiners like my stuff because I
[50:55] say hey I like Bitcoin hey Robin for
[50:57] days is doing some Bitcoin content I
[50:59] like the Bitcoin content and I do that
[51:01] too I also like we all like Bitcoin
[51:03] content because we like it when people
[51:04] do Bitcoin coin content and even if it's
[51:07] not something that we really really say
[51:09] yeah this this really made my day or
[51:10] this really really uh really fascinated
[51:12] me um even even then we say it's it's
[51:16] cool it's good then we press like but
[51:18] what I like even more is when people who
[51:19] are actually not bitcoiners press the
[51:21] like button retweet it and even if they
[51:23] say yeah I like it because then you say
[51:25] then you do something that that speaks
[51:26] to The Human Condition something
[51:28] something where you say when when
[51:30] something bothers you so much when
[51:32] something is so so dear to you that they
[51:33] say okay I'm going to make this this
[51:35] this huge huge goal like like for
[51:38] example when Elon mus said I want to put
[51:40] people on mass and I want to build a
[51:42] city on mass people say he's crazy
[51:44] people say he's absolutely literally
[51:45] insane but I've I've read like all his
[51:48] biographies I've read his his new
[51:50] biographies his new biography I'm I'm
[51:52] like halfway through but I've read this
[51:54] pre previous biography and I've listened
[51:56] to many repetitions of all his
[51:58] interviews and I've listened to people
[52:00] who directly work with work with him and
[52:02] I said to him this goal the city on mass
[52:05] is really something to do and again I
[52:06] don't want to make any comments on on
[52:08] Elon Musk I don't want to make any
[52:10] comments if it's possible if it's good
[52:11] to make a city on mass but I just want
[52:13] to to people if you have a cool dream if
[52:16] you have a cool emotion um be sane about
[52:18] it Be Clever about it I still have a job
[52:21] like this is something that you might
[52:22] ask yourself are you just an unempowered
[52:25] person doing this no I'm not a Bitcoin
[52:26] Co whale I took many many many years to
[52:28] learn about it and I have a full-time
[52:30] job I have a good relationship with my
[52:32] friends and family I'm a normal person
[52:34] on the on the surface maybe but um but
[52:37] it's okay you can be a normal person
[52:39] like um there's this this this this this
[52:41] new personal development man guy who's
[52:43] not a personal development guy his name
[52:45] is Thor um he's really called Thor like
[52:48] like the God and he developed this this
[52:50] game um heartbound and he makes many
[52:52] shorts on YouTube and he gives people
[52:55] Vice about video game making and it's
[52:57] really about life advice in my my my
[52:59] opinion video game making as I said it's
[53:01] an art form it's beautiful it's an art a
[53:03] really well well-made video game can
[53:06] touch your soul just like like
[53:08] Shakespeare can maybe it's not
[53:09] historically so so significant like
[53:11] Hamlet or M Beth maybe they are more
[53:13] significant granted but I think your
[53:15] your heart and your soul Can Be Touched
[53:17] By by something that's why the game is
[53:18] called heartbound because it has
[53:19] something to do with that scene and he
[53:21] says like it's okay you don't need to go
[53:23] crazy you don't need to need to be be
[53:26] homeless unemployed you don't need to be
[53:27] like David gorgin and literally go 5%
[53:30] before killing yourself or 1% you can
[53:33] make your dreams come true you can make
[53:35] it with Bitcoin you can make it with
[53:36] anything just be sensible have a new
[53:39] regular job but have also a realistic
[53:42] way where don't ask for p he says it
[53:44] about video gaming what I see in Bitcoin
[53:45] as s and again he has no direct link to
[53:48] bitcoin same disclaimer as with the
[53:49] other guys I quoted he says like he says
[53:52] like you have to go slow go for slow
[53:55] steps before I did this people tell to
[53:57] me why do you think Robin that you can
[53:59] write the word Bitcoin 21 million times
[54:01] why do you think you have the
[54:01] qualification and I could show them so
[54:03] much qualification I have been writing
[54:06] so many many words I've been writing
[54:08] since I could write I have a degree in
[54:10] the University where we did where we did
[54:12] Chinese as as a degree I have a fully
[54:15] fledged I can prove people that I
[54:16] studied fully fledged Chinese bachelor
[54:19] degree sadly I forgot many of the
[54:21] Chinese R but I can prove I can can get
[54:23] the degrees where where I have fully
[54:25] fledged I was born in Germany I learned
[54:27] English as a second language where I did
[54:28] fully fledged Chinese degrees and I was
[54:31] sitting there I was like I don't know if
[54:33] I'm going to use Chinese but I know I'm
[54:34] going to use the writing for something
[54:36] and I was always like yeah but all these
[54:38] people I read so many many many articles
[54:40] there's so many books and articles how
[54:42] do you become a writer and I was always
[54:44] like oh I have to do all these things I
[54:46] have to if I want to become a fiction
[54:47] writer I have to read all of Brandon
[54:49] Sison and all of to all of the the the
[54:52] other stuff that that that tolkin airs
[54:55] like like like the witch in the water
[54:57] room everything you have to read that
[54:59] you can't be a writer if you don't have
[55:00] written read this impossible list and
[55:03] everybody has this impossible list and
[55:04] at some point I was like no I'm just
[55:06] wasting time it's not about me being a
[55:08] novelist I don't want to be um a JK
[55:10] Roland I don't want to be a BRI Brandon
[55:12] serson I don't want to be talking I just
[55:13] want to do this thing and I think many
[55:15] people have this precon and toor Thor
[55:17] says it too in his YouTube shorts he
[55:19] says many people think to make a video
[55:21] game or to to do something creative with
[55:23] video games you have to be yet you have
[55:25] to be John Kack you have to have 20
[55:27] years or 30 years in C++ you have to be
[55:30] the best you have to be in Ania for your
[55:32] language you have to be beond sroke you
[55:34] have to have memorized all C++ libraries
[55:36] C++ one of the most difficult languages
[55:38] you can ever imagine doing that no you
[55:41] you can just do it and that's like um
[55:43] yeah that's the message and I know today
[55:46] I'm not a very wellknown person but my
[55:47] my idea is to go on with it have new
[55:50] ideas I have many many new ideas as I
[55:52] said I don't want to make promises that
[55:53] I can keep I'm not going to have
[55:55] impostor syndrome that's why I talked
[55:57] like for 57 minutes straight right now
[55:59] but I'm not ashamed I don't have a pasta
[56:01] syndrome I don't think I'm a babbling
[56:02] fool that talks about stuff that he's
[56:04] not supposed to talk about or talking
[56:06] out of Le I I did the work and um if
[56:09] people react to it if some people said
[56:10] yeah I'm going to re re retweet it
[56:12] repost it people can support me um if I
[56:15] have enough reposts I'm I'm I'm going to
[56:18] switch to I'm going to also do twitch
[56:19] streams people then can will be able to
[56:22] sub to my twitch stream I'm going to
[56:24] make be able to do custom content and
[56:27] maybe it happens maybe it doesn't but my
[56:28] idea is that is like the story as good
[56:30] as I can tell them to you that's it
[56:33] basically uh that was
[56:35] amazing thank
[56:37] you I had like uh at least like 25 times
[56:42] where like I want to go in here and I
[56:44] want to talk about that specific topic
[56:47] with you because it seems so
[56:51] interesting but you did a very good job
[56:53] this is very very difficult what you did
[56:55] because everybody is trigger happy it's
[56:58] like when you're sniper and you're
[57:00] looking at a crowd of people and you
[57:01] want to get the bad guy but the shot is
[57:03] bad everybody wants to do and you didn't
[57:05] this is very very good this is this is
[57:07] this sounds like FY but it's it's not
[57:09] easy what you do it's not easy actually
[57:11] yeah it's it's uh so important when you
[57:14] interview people that you let them speak
[57:17] because I think as I discovered uh um
[57:21] when I listen to someone the brain
[57:24] automatically thinks of
[57:26] you did with that thing like it think
[57:29] about oh he did that and I for I do this
[57:33] too and it's it's it's fascinating and
[57:35] it's really really um hard to do it in
[57:38] the interviews but I always try to do it
[57:41] and and let the guest speaker and it's
[57:43] like with Lex Freedman Lex Freedman is
[57:45] very known he is one of the biggest
[57:46] podcasters ever and most of what you do
[57:48] is like oh this is amazing and people
[57:51] like why why is he why is he so good and
[57:53] then you watch most interviews like most
[57:55] Legacy Media they like like like the
[57:57] German talk shows they always interrupt
[57:59] and you're like oh why isn't this so
[58:01] good why doesn't millions of millions of
[58:02] people watch the German German don't
[58:05] again I want don't want to call somebody
[58:06] out because they haven't mastered their
[58:08] craft they haven't done the work and
[58:10] mastered the self- discipline and
[58:11] everything yeah I mean it's a for for me
[58:14] it was a no prer for for from the day
[58:17] one on because I really enjoy Joe Rogan
[58:21] Lex Freedman all those podcasts and Joe
[58:23] Rogan maybe also talks a lot uh in in
[58:26] his podcast but he's really good also in
[58:28] in interviewing Lex Freedman yeah he's
[58:31] is a master of of interviewing yeah um
[58:35] the one thing uh I want to talk about
[58:39] still with you even though we are at one
[58:41] hour
[58:42] Mar um it's so good it has a timer
[58:45] otherwise I would gone to two hours and
[58:46] you would have had to cut me off so it's
[58:48] very good that your software here has
[58:49] the the cter it works very well yeah um
[58:53] you have a really clear mind I think
[58:56] like you have a really um you sorted
[58:58] your thoughts and I I really like
[59:02] walking like I like just walking in the
[59:05] woods and the forests and and clear my
[59:07] thoughts and sort my thoughts and it's
[59:09] usually when I do not the exact thing
[59:12] that I'm supposed to do that I think of
[59:15] solutions and I think of new ideas about
[59:17] something because my brain has time to
[59:19] brief and I felt like probably for you
[59:23] this when you work full-time you consume
[59:25] content learn about new stuffff you do
[59:27] maybe other stuff also when you write
[59:30] Bitcoin for like over 300,000 times it's
[59:33] basically like muscle memories like you
[59:36] you probably don't have to think about
[59:38] the writing too much um Maybe I'm Wrong
[59:42] um and it's like a time where you can
[59:45] focus on something and clear your
[59:47] thoughts and it's maybe Med like
[59:50] meditative uh uh where you can get
[59:52] something out of that like because your
[59:54] brain is fascinating because it's not
[59:57] easy to talk so long and and there's
[60:00] some line in there like like there was
[60:04] some some story in that it's not just
[60:06] like rambling on and it's like all over
[60:09] the place and it it does not make sense
[60:11] because then people don't want to listen
[60:13] but it made sense what you talked and it
[60:16] had like stories and you can make points
[60:18] there and make a nice video out of that
[60:21] and stuff like that but uh does does
[60:23] this writing help you in uh other ways
[60:27] like sorting your thoughts and and
[60:30] making better life decisions and and
[60:33] being like a more calm and clear
[60:37] thinker yes yes that's a that's a very
[60:40] good question the muscle memory question
[60:41] is very very interesting um I started
[60:44] out getting into a muscle memory and
[60:47] obviously there is muscle memory like
[60:48] it's it's absolutely absolutely obvious
[60:51] what I try to do is I try to always um
[60:54] go back to concentrating you can
[60:56] concentrate like if you ride for an hour
[60:57] you can concentrate perfectly for 1 hour
[60:59] like maybe there's a zen master that can
[61:01] do that but I'm not that zen master but
[61:03] I always try to put a little bit of of
[61:06] uncertainty into my writing um people
[61:09] say oh I have have have a bad and muddy
[61:11] handwriting the muddy handwriting is
[61:13] actually on purpose and I actually put
[61:15] more uncertainty and more squiggles into
[61:18] as much as I can I try to actually write
[61:20] every word as quietly as possible
[61:21] because um people are definitely going
[61:23] to say you are using software W you are
[61:26] using something fake you are using chat
[61:28] GPT you are using something and my idea
[61:31] is I want to experiment so the muscle
[61:34] memory is definitely true on the one
[61:35] hand on the other hand I try to
[61:36] experiment very very much if you zoom in
[61:39] into my work you will see that I try
[61:40] different styles and different things so
[61:43] the muscle memory is there but I always
[61:44] try to fight it for reasons of of um of
[61:47] trying to develop my own style and for
[61:50] reasons of not making it look like it's
[61:51] printed because if you want really clear
[61:53] letters then you can just a printer
[61:56] that's not the problem I I I want to I
[61:58] want to be self-expressive like a famous
[62:00] uh um a famous Street Fighter um Dao was
[62:03] once asked why are you playing rayu you
[62:05] could have played this other character
[62:07] which is stronger than your character he
[62:08] said I can express myself better with it
[62:10] and that's what I try this is true I
[62:12] have muscle memory and I try to try to
[62:15] fight it not because I I hate muscle
[62:17] memory muscle is perfectly okay David
[62:20] goggin when he runs and he does this
[62:21] amazing things he also has muscle memory
[62:23] running but I have to find it for my
[62:25] style and for not making it look too
[62:27] printed that that it's okay and the
[62:30] thing with the other ways um yes I think
[62:32] that's that's definitely true I think
[62:34] it's really you can't really think about
[62:36] personal development and your stuff
[62:38] together I think if I if I have
[62:39] stressful situations writing helps
[62:42] writing about this this thing or just
[62:44] writing about about um your your
[62:46] business plan for example um Jeff Beados
[62:48] said when he was stressed when he was
[62:50] starting Amazon he would write a
[62:51] business plan or he would write an email
[62:54] he would put it into thoughts like I I
[62:55] think generally writing is therapeutic I
[62:58] think that might be what your question
[62:59] is about writing is therapeutic this is
[63:02] this is scientifically proven that's not
[63:04] thought about you can read many many um
[63:06] when I was um studying at University
[63:09] several of my professors and doctors who
[63:11] are really scientists who history really
[63:14] hardcore scientists who had thousands of
[63:15] publication they said like for them
[63:17] writing was therapeutic they were in a
[63:19] bad head space and writing definitely
[63:21] helped them and what you said about
[63:23] walking I think walking right also like
[63:25] love walking around and I think that's
[63:27] also walking and writing are very
[63:29] similar in a way these are very Primal
[63:31] physical activities and you have so many
[63:33] examples about writing obviously but
[63:35] about walking too like you have great
[63:36] great mathematicians like Andrew Wilds
[63:38] they have their best breakthroughs
[63:40] through writing when they're away and
[63:43] then they go they go they go in the
[63:44] walking space but for me obviously I
[63:47] write to I walk to but for me it's more
[63:49] of of the writing but yeah this
[63:50] connection I can definitely um affirm
[63:52] that I believe in it too yeah I started
[63:55] walking when I I got a dog because I
[63:58] lived at home and there was like we had
[64:00] a dog and I never walked before and I
[64:02] was forced to walk and then I was like
[64:03] oh it's interesting that uh walking
[64:05] actually is is nice and now I walk
[64:07] without dog also um that's uh amazing
[64:11] for getting closer to the end I wanted
[64:14] to ask you um do you have plans or maybe
[64:18] even like contacts with with people that
[64:21] you put your writings in some sort of
[64:25] art form like uh some like maybe the the
[64:29] first uh uh blocks in some art or maybe
[64:33] there's like an an pattered in there
[64:35] where you can make art form with it or
[64:37] it's like featured in a Bitcoin Gallery
[64:39] like is there um some some end goal with
[64:43] the pieces of of of of writings
[64:47] itself yeah yeah definitely uh the the
[64:50] idea is I have I have not so many
[64:53] restrictions there are still many I have
[64:55] already been contacted by by by some
[64:57] some Bitcoin related art galleries I've
[64:59] been contacted by podcasts and stuff
[65:01] like that in my ideas I want to do many
[65:03] many things if people like fractal
[65:05] encrypt or other people want to
[65:07] incorporate my art into their art or
[65:09] something I'm open to many things like
[65:11] like uh there was a famous singer and he
[65:13] said I I always try to evolve myself
[65:15] I've already experimented a little bit
[65:18] I've done like certain certain wood
[65:20] things and I've tried but but so far
[65:21] nothing with my art has come out that I
[65:23] want to say Okay I want to present it
[65:24] because I only want to and stuff that I
[65:26] think that is that is cool that is
[65:28] really cool but yeah definitely I'm
[65:30] definitely going to participate in in
[65:32] art exhibitions and I definitely 100%
[65:35] plan on doing some some for example
[65:37] taking my writing and putting it on some
[65:39] wall or doing something with tapestry um
[65:43] or or cutting it into ribbons and
[65:45] putting the ribbons there there's lots
[65:46] of as I said I have background in
[65:48] Chinese and background background in
[65:49] East Asian Asian um literature and
[65:52] writing like there are many things that
[65:53] you can do but um I want to let the
[65:56] market decide like if some some art for
[65:59] art some if somebody who does art says
[66:02] Hey I want to incorporate your stuff if
[66:04] a gallery comes to it if a podcast like
[66:07] you comes to me and said I want to do
[66:08] something I want to you to to hold it
[66:10] into camera whatever I'm open to it but
[66:12] I wish to get like reasonable
[66:15] intellectual ability to do it because
[66:18] what I don't want to do is end up at
[66:19] some somebody who just sells all their
[66:21] rights away to some some company let's
[66:23] say in in in 10 years this is really
[66:25] popular and some big company comes to
[66:27] say and say sign on the do line we we
[66:30] give you a couple of of bucks and then
[66:32] all of your intellectual property
[66:33] belongs to us I always want to say that
[66:36] that what people are are free to do
[66:37] whatever they want but they are
[66:39] obviously free to do right to bitcoin
[66:41] themselves but if they want want want to
[66:43] use my stuff they they they should
[66:45] credit me and if they want to do
[66:46] something commercially they should
[66:47] contact me within reason like I don't
[66:49] want to be like like like restrictive I
[66:51] I love bitcoiners I I love what you do I
[66:54] really love love it and I have many
[66:56] things planned but I'm leaning back if
[66:59] few people care about it I will just
[67:01] keep doing it in a very low key maybe
[67:03] maybe some folding maybe some origami
[67:05] maybe some easy stuff depending on what
[67:08] the feedback is depending on how many
[67:10] people like it retweet it whatever or
[67:12] not depending on that I will take any
[67:15] art form that I can as I said jokingly
[67:18] if if millions of people like it and and
[67:20] and they sponsor me I will literally go
[67:22] with a SpaceX rocket to moon and chis
[67:24] the moon and chisel the words into into
[67:27] moon rock or go into space station and
[67:29] do it there the sky is the limit but it
[67:31] depends what people want I'm not going
[67:33] to I'm not I'm going to see like like
[67:36] Milton Freeman said let the market
[67:37] decide the market will reveal gradually
[67:40] what it wants like it did for for for
[67:43] the other artists the market they
[67:45] started doing it they experimented I do
[67:47] this I do that something the market
[67:49] didn't care for other things it cared
[67:50] about and then the market revealed the
[67:52] solution to you and that's the way I
[67:54] want to uh make it really yeah I think
[67:56] this is an extremely healthy mindset and
[67:59] an extremely good way to approach it um
[68:03] and good way to do it it's it's like
[68:05] also how the podcast actually evolve
[68:07] because it's like I talked with more
[68:09] more people uh online and did not record
[68:12] it and then I was like I can record it
[68:13] also and then oh all of the sudden I'm
[68:15] doing five podcasts a week and I'm
[68:17] thinking of doing it daily and uh yeah
[68:21] it's really really cool um for our end
[68:24] routine uh as you probably know we have
[68:27] rtin where the previous guest asked a
[68:29] question for the next guest I stole that
[68:31] from the Diary of a CEO one of the
[68:33] podcasts I really like to to look uh
[68:36] maybe you also heard about it with it
[68:38] works with Bitcoin too like with one
[68:39] block being hashed next to the other
[68:41] block so this is real cool thing to do
[68:44] yes it's it's amazing and I I want to do
[68:46] also something with it like maybe cards
[68:49] or maybe I don't know there there's a
[68:50] lot of things I can I can do with that
[68:53] uh but right now I'm just using it for
[68:55] for the it's cool it's it's really I
[68:57] really enjoy enjoy that that's that's a
[68:59] really uh good to do that uh really good
[69:02] idea that you picked up there yeah and
[69:04] in the beginning I did that uh the guest
[69:07] does not know the next guest but
[69:10] sometimes they ask I'm like yeah okay
[69:12] let's let's reveal who the next guest is
[69:14] and then I talked yesterday with a
[69:15] physicist the Gian Giovani guy from the
[69:19] Bitcoin power
[69:21] law and he had an interesting question
[69:24] um he's big on maths and physics and
[69:27] stuff like that and how you can imagine
[69:29] numbers and and stuff like that and and
[69:32] I explained to him what you're doing and
[69:34] he's like oh that's interesting because
[69:36] when you have a certain amount of time
[69:39] and he used the the time of three months
[69:42] he's like when you take three months to
[69:45] have like 21 million Bitcoin written
[69:48] down I'm like yeah I think it will take
[69:49] a little longer than three
[69:52] months indeed and uh
[69:56] when when you're like okay let's say 50
[69:58] years it takes like 50 years for for it
[70:00] to like write it down uh how long will
[70:04] it take uh to write Bitcoin down 34
[70:08] trillion times at the national dep uh
[70:11] reference um it's it's an an interesting
[70:14] experiment and it's like a physical
[70:16] technical question uh because it's like
[70:19] um there's also this this comparison
[70:22] like how how how long uh is it when you
[70:26] have one million seconds and how long is
[70:28] it when you have one billion seconds and
[70:31] like the the the difference is so
[70:33] stunningly big uh but it's unintuitive
[70:36] how big it is right yes it's like it's
[70:39] hard to imagine yeah and it's like I did
[70:41] not calculate it uh for the 34 trillion
[70:45] times uh but I imagine it's like such a
[70:48] big number and then yeah also the
[70:51] question is what are you going to do it
[70:53] because because specifically I to do it
[70:55] like a like like a marathon about my
[70:57] lifetime but it's really the the
[70:59] interesting thing behind that is really
[71:01] is really that uh Bitcoin will live that
[71:04] long like I won't live that long you
[71:06] won't live that long but Bitcoin will do
[71:07] it and in a sense um in a sense the way
[71:11] this is also that this is also um about
[71:14] my work um I'm trying to to reaffirm
[71:17] Bitcoin and Bitcoin every single 10
[71:19] minute Bitcoin is going to reaffirm
[71:21] itself like like uh if you do it trends
[71:25] of times this this will certainly take
[71:27] more than one lifetime but it's the cool
[71:29] thing is Bitcoin will do that and and
[71:31] the really cool thing is that that some
[71:34] some um future civilizations might do a
[71:36] variation of my of my thing but when
[71:39] people live live like millions of years
[71:41] then they can do it then they can can
[71:44] answer can then give a because I don't
[71:46] believe in theoretical answer I believe
[71:47] in answer that that they can give
[71:49] concretely and and yeah but maybe but
[71:52] maybe um I really love physicists I'm
[71:55] I'm really big fan also also also of
[71:57] practical PHS especially if they are uh
[71:59] connected with Bitcoin so I'm going to
[72:01] I'm going to try if the Buddhists are
[72:03] right and I'm going to get reincarnated
[72:04] later and I'm going to try to to find it
[72:06] out I'm going to try to make his his his
[72:09] his uh 21 trillion challenge a reality
[72:12] some people ask me then I should that I
[72:14] should write write down um write down
[72:16] like 100 million time times another
[72:19] altcoin or something but altcoins I will
[72:21] not do in my lifetime but um I'm going
[72:23] to try to do it in my my next lifetime
[72:25] if I get reincarnated as another writing
[72:27] happy person I'm going to try to do it
[72:28] trillions of times but first of all 21
[72:31] million times that's let's go one step
[72:33] at a time
[72:35] okay yeah there's also the the I think
[72:39] there was in some tweets and like why
[72:41] don't you use satosi like the 2.1
[72:44] quadrillion yes yes that's that's also
[72:47] good
[72:48] like the the spirit is willing but the
[72:50] flesh is weak
[72:53] right teach say said you can just write
[72:56] sets it's okay to just write set yeah
[72:58] thank you yeah of course that solves all
[73:00] the problems of writing writing all the
[73:02] sets out
[73:03] yes um it was an amazing podcast I it is
[73:08] I it positively surprised me uh I was
[73:12] like it's interesting that someone does
[73:14] that uh and it's like uh I hoped for
[73:18] exactly that for like uh how how to stay
[73:21] consistent how to do the proof of work
[73:23] but positively surpris yes me way more
[73:26] because I never heard you before I do
[73:28] that all the time where I invite people
[73:30] that I never heard before but I think
[73:31] there's something interesting about them
[73:33] and I don't do the podcast because
[73:35] what's the worst thing that can happen I
[73:37] have a bad conversation okay wor thing
[73:39] is it's it's like a dut like y let's not
[73:41] talk about it
[73:43] right but so far as I said the podcast
[73:45] as I heard they they really they really
[73:46] gave me lots of value that's that's anly
[73:49] very cool what you're doing yeah I have
[73:51] the uh I have the simple goal to just
[73:53] like uh um speak to as many Bitcoins as
[73:56] possible yeah and maybe when I can now
[74:00] in March do a little bit more maybe I
[74:02] get over the 300 bitcoiners mark for
[74:05] this year to interview 300 bitcoiners
[74:08] that's why I don't uh invite people on
[74:10] for second time maybe I will do it in
[74:12] the future but right now everyone is
[74:14] like unique maybe I know one year I have
[74:16] like oh this was really interesting I
[74:18] should have him on again but I just want
[74:20] to interview as many bis K as possible
[74:23] and it's it's also muscle like you're my
[74:26] 56th guest now and I started in December
[74:30] so it's like the the third month and I'm
[74:33] going to the 60 Mark and it's it's a
[74:36] great journey to be on yeah absolutely I
[74:38] think you're doing the right thing if
[74:39] you if you look at anybody who really
[74:42] got really stuff done in in in in
[74:45] podcasting like like blog trainer like
[74:47] anybody you have to you have to really
[74:50] really put in the work that's that's
[74:51] nothing is going to replace the work
[74:53] nothing is going to replace what you do
[74:55] doing you have to do the work the work
[74:56] doesn't care who you are the work just
[74:58] cares about it being done and you
[75:00] putting in the grind like the work grind
[75:02] I avoid the work but it's really also
[75:04] like in a positive sense it's about a
[75:05] grind it's you can't substitute it and
[75:08] there are crazy statistics to that uh
[75:11] there's on like to the free podcast
[75:14] marks like when when there's 100% of
[75:16] podcasts they started episode one only
[75:20] 3% of those podcasts make it to the
[75:23] third episode yeah and only 1% make it
[75:26] to the 20 Mark uh 20 episode Mark and
[75:30] there's also another amazing like I was
[75:34] stunned by that statistic because I
[75:35] thought there are so many podcasts out
[75:37] there but there aren't as many podcasts
[75:39] out there um there are only 400,000
[75:42] podcasts that did one episode in the
[75:45] last 90 days like in the last 90 days
[75:49] when you go to the statistic where only
[75:52] how many podcasts are there that do it
[75:54] weekly or even like almost daily I don't
[75:57] have the numbers I did not find good
[75:59] numbers for that but I guess it's like
[76:01] way lower uh so it's it's interesting
[76:04] that there are not a lot of uh people
[76:07] doing uh it over and over a lot of
[76:09] people started a lot of people uh try it
[76:13] but no then uh they lack discipline so
[76:16] it's it's really interesting to see that
[76:18] you are doing something yeah I think
[76:20] it's so valuable you're doing something
[76:21] that is very different from me you are
[76:23] you are talking to a lot of people
[76:24] people and getting personto person
[76:26] engagement and this is like the two the
[76:28] yin and yang one people that do physical
[76:30] stuff they program they do art they do
[76:32] something that is like more there on
[76:34] their person other people they the
[76:35] connectors us and really it's like you
[76:37] need both you need people who do the one
[76:39] thing and the other thing it's like it's
[76:41] like water and and and food you need
[76:43] both water and food otherwise it doesn't
[76:45] work you need both it's necessary 100%
[76:48] very true um for the end where can
[76:52] people find you the best where can
[76:54] people get in touch with you when they
[76:56] want to find your work when they want to
[76:58] ask you questions yes you can just go to
[77:01] to my Twitter it's Robin for days Robin
[77:04] like the football player I in Robin
[77:06] Robin then the number four and the
[77:08] number days like in day one day the pro
[77:11] pro Robin for days you can just follow
[77:13] me on TW on Twitter X currently on
[77:15] Twitter X my DMs are open if you are a
[77:17] cool bitcoiner then I will most likely
[77:19] follow you back and you can ask me any
[77:21] questions all of my stuff is there and
[77:23] um you can engage in the future I might
[77:25] do some twitch but right now you can
[77:27] just shoot me a DM and if you're a cool
[77:30] Bitcoin and if you're not trying to to
[77:31] do anything that is grossly like I'm not
[77:34] super super extreme but if you don't do
[77:37] anything that is grossly like you're not
[77:38] trying to sell me some some nft or some
[77:41] altcoin or something I'm willing to talk
[77:43] about almost anything I'm cool with that
[77:46] yeah really really cool uh what you are
[77:48] doing and I think definitely you should
[77:50] start uh streaming it it would be it
[77:53] would be fun many people ask about it if
[77:55] I reach like a certain threshold if if
[77:57] if I get like a certain threshold of
[77:59] people then I'm definitely going to do
[78:00] it I have all the equipment I'm just
[78:02] saying I streamed a lot for fun but if I
[78:04] stream now I want to really have have it
[78:06] have it persistently so I want to reach
[78:09] like go to
[78:10] 400,000 maybe 500,000 I think at the end
[78:13] if I go to a million at then it's it's
[78:15] like the last Point like in a couple of
[78:17] years but at some point um more and more
[78:20] people keep asking me in D Ms right now
[78:22] um if I stream it and I want to I'm a
[78:24] big fan of twitch I think it works very
[78:26] well technically so this is definitely
[78:27] in the future uh definitely I'm looking
[78:30] forward to it uh thank you for being on
[78:33] yeah thank
[78:39] you
