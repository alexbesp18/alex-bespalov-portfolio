[00:00] it's the first time now that Bitcoin is
[00:02] officially the most scarce asset on
[00:04] planet Earth most people underestimated
[00:07] the the sheer demand that these CFS
[00:09] would actually have privacy is a cavet
[00:12] of the past and it's something that we
[00:14] don't really understand the value of
[00:17] until it fades and when it fades it will
[00:20] be very very difficult to regain
[00:22] everyone has either heard red or even
[00:25] being close to someone who has up
[00:28] tremendously on their Bitcoin hold in an
[00:30] ideal world you would have as close to
[00:32] 100% holding their own
[00:35] Keys Hi rri how are you doing hey man
[00:38] I'm good I'm in a pleasant mood it's
[00:41] Bitcoin Haring day or the day after
[00:43] Haring depending on the time zone I'm
[00:46] sitting in Cyprus right now so to me
[00:49] Haring happened on uh on 420 I I find a
[00:52] little uh fun note on that I'm sure Elon
[00:55] Musk would like it yes for me also it
[00:58] happened on on 420 like five 4 in the
[01:00] morning something like that uh is there
[01:03] something special about that Haring like
[01:04] is there something you find interesting
[01:06] about this special Haring I mean I've
[01:09] been around for more than a decade now
[01:11] and and involved with Bitcoin and
[01:14] there's always something magical about a
[01:16] pre-programmed event that just runs like
[01:20] clockwork uh I must say for me the
[01:22] special thing about this having has
[01:24] basically been that I paid no attention
[01:26] really I've not stayed up late I've not
[01:29] even watched uh the the blocks uh get
[01:33] cracked and and and see how is the chain
[01:36] still Runner going to run smoothly or is
[01:39] it all over now is there some Buck going
[01:41] to present itself um I did that in the
[01:45] past I remember even spending like half
[01:48] of my Day in
[01:50] 2020 uh seeing what will happen once the
[01:53] the block actually got cracked that uh
[01:55] would lead us into a lower block reward
[01:57] so um no for me this this business as
[02:01] usual uh I think it's astonishing to
[02:04] have an asset with a monetary policy
[02:07] that's pre-programmed and it just runs I
[02:10] mean when we see established markets
[02:12] right now and see how policy guided uh
[02:16] risk markets has really been like the
[02:18] stock market is basically moving uh
[02:21] multiple percent based on what the
[02:24] Federal Reserve chairman uh is saying on
[02:26] a on a press conference I find that a
[02:29] little in verse order it's supposed to
[02:31] be the other way around that the market
[02:34] is moving and policy follows not policy
[02:38] makes the market uh so for me this is
[02:41] astonishing with Bitcoin I'm pretty
[02:44] happy about it then in terms of just a
[02:46] Haring I mean it's the first time now
[02:49] that Bitcoin is officially the most
[02:52] scarce asset on planet Earth so before
[02:54] this particular Haring uh Bitcoin would
[02:57] actually have a a higher inflation rate
[02:59] than gold gold but now it's lower um
[03:03] this is amazing um this stipulates the
[03:05] whole idea and ideology between uh what
[03:08] Bitcoin is and what you can deem as a
[03:11] scarce asset um I find that very magical
[03:15] almost I would say and it's also
[03:17] interesting because it's the first
[03:19] Haring where we had the alltime high
[03:22] before the Haring and we also have the
[03:24] Bitcoin ETFs basically in the same time
[03:27] frame as the uh har like just a few
[03:30] months before that and now we have the
[03:31] Hong Kong ETFs also in in China um what
[03:35] do you expect from all of that in the
[03:37] like the next coming months years uh
[03:39] from from from
[03:41] that so there's big difference to the
[03:43] different variables there uh you
[03:46] mentioned three of of the ones that are
[03:48] of some importance here so I don't think
[03:51] this particular having would mean much
[03:54] because if you think about the fact of
[03:56] how little of Supply was actually being
[03:59] released in to the network on a daily
[04:01] monthly level compared to the already
[04:04] released Supply uh I don't think it
[04:07] moves the the needle that much on on on
[04:10] price actually so the supply side is
[04:14] dwindling we've known that for years um
[04:17] the rate of distribution gets Cuts in
[04:19] half every four year but for
[04:23] every
[04:24] succeeding and subsequent having event
[04:27] that takes place the having will have
[04:30] less of an effect on on the total Supply
[04:32] released into the market so um in that
[04:36] sense I wouldn't call it a no Burger of
[04:39] course it has a meaning and I think even
[04:41] from historical point of view and just
[04:44] on a Bitcoin cycle basis that coincides
[04:47] also with American election Cycles it
[04:49] has an importance but it has less of an
[04:51] importance that it did in the past as
[04:53] for the ETFs that is more demand side um
[04:58] driven in terms of of uh people getting
[05:01] on boarded to bitcoin uh people who
[05:06] previously were prevented in taking
[05:08] exposure now have accessibility to buy
[05:11] Bitcoin uh either through their company
[05:14] do it personally they didn't want to do
[05:16] it before because they were afraid of
[05:18] tax or accounting or whatever
[05:21] implications uh security um
[05:25] considerations um the the ETFs are sort
[05:28] of fixing all those problems with just
[05:31] enabling you to buy Bitcoin from your
[05:34] bank or the normal investing tool that
[05:37] you're using or
[05:38] brokerage um so that is incrementally
[05:43] higher uh importance uh for Price
[05:46] development of Bitcoin rather than uh
[05:50] the halfing itself
[05:52] now I think
[05:54] for this year we've had the luxury of
[05:58] basically having these two big
[06:00] narratives
[06:02] of like from August last year people
[06:07] started to become very very certain that
[06:11] the Haring would sorry that the ETFs
[06:13] would actually be uh approved in the
[06:15] United States and once they got approved
[06:20] um most people underestimated that the
[06:23] sheer demand that the CFS would actually
[06:26] have on even just the medium term so
[06:29] usually if you see ETF launches they
[06:32] will always have a a spike in activity
[06:35] they Spike up and as they spike a
[06:39] interest Fades a little bit over time um
[06:44] you can argue this has happened a little
[06:45] bit with the American ETFs as well but
[06:48] nonetheless you have seen consistent
[06:51] activity consistent trading flow and
[06:54] consistent inflow of capital um of
[06:58] course there's been the the drag from
[07:01] grayscale or
[07:02] gbtc basically selling out um of their
[07:06] supplier the people who are holding gbtc
[07:08] would sell their their assets um that's
[07:12] naturally going to come to a stop at
[07:15] some point um I'm not even sure if
[07:19] if if
[07:21] um black rocks ETFs actually surpassed
[07:25] grayscale I I don't think they did yet
[07:27] right no they're a little bit behind so
[07:28] black rock is is currently at
[07:31] 273,000 Bitcoin held at grayscale is at
[07:35] 304 so it's probably a matter of months
[07:40] before that flippening will will happen
[07:44] um so naturally gray scale's position in
[07:48] the market is also
[07:50] dwindling it's interesting uh to see
[07:52] this all shaking out and it's like the
[07:54] first few months I think uh people
[07:56] expected uh so much of the deaths for
[07:59] like oh it's launching and then we are
[08:01] instantly at 100,000 200,000 um was was
[08:04] this kind of expected also from from
[08:06] your side that we have this uh also sell
[08:09] pressure with with the outflows is is
[08:12] there was there something surprising for
[08:13] you in the first months yes very much so
[08:17] uh one thing is I nailed it when I
[08:22] basically said that this was a Biden
[08:24] Biden news event um I would say on the
[08:28] on the very short term I was wrong on
[08:30] that because basically price went up and
[08:32] it RND like it it had
[08:35] trouble uh leaving its range around the
[08:38] 40s uh for Bitcoin and took that big
[08:41] hype up almost to 50 only to crash back
[08:44] below 40 again so on the short term it
[08:47] was a selda news but if you look at the
[08:50] ETF inflows and basically compare that
[08:54] to the price development of Bitcoin I
[08:57] mean it's it's very very obvious that
[08:58] the ETF F demand is probably the biggest
[09:03] contributor right now to price
[09:05] development in in Bitcoin
[09:08] so I would credit myself for getting
[09:11] that one right what I did get wrong was
[09:14] on the other hand the great scale
[09:16] outflows I watched as everyone uh the
[09:20] fee schedules coming out from each of
[09:22] the ETFs and I was excited to see that
[09:24] there was basically going a reverse
[09:26] bidding war going on about getting the
[09:29] low fees because the lowest fees would
[09:31] arguably attract the most Capital the
[09:34] most Capital would attract the most
[09:36] trading flow would attract more Capital
[09:39] would essentially be the winning ETFs I
[09:42] had in mind beforehand that black rock
[09:43] would probably come out swinging I also
[09:46] wrote uh a few articles how I think that
[09:50] black rock basically taking a swing at
[09:52] this they they're looking for a home run
[09:54] they don't want to just B it down the uh
[09:58] down the side
[09:59] uh it was a real reputational risk they
[10:02] they took on on on basically putting
[10:04] their name behind an ETF so they were
[10:08] looking to win and in hindsight they are
[10:11] definitely in a position to also be the
[10:13] winning entity uh behind
[10:16] ETFs it's interesting for me also the
[10:18] the stories that go on when I came into
[10:20] Bitcoin it was in 2020 uh the big story
[10:23] was obviously micro strategy and then
[10:25] later on with with Tesla and all the
[10:27] publicly traded companies that came came
[10:29] into Bitcoin I think micro strategy was
[10:33] the first one and then now we are like
[10:35] 60 70 80 publicly traded companies that
[10:38] are having Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[10:40] I might get that number wrong but there
[10:42] are a lot of publicly traded company
[10:44] already having Bitcoin uh and then we
[10:48] have another story also with micro
[10:49] strategy maybe making it to the S&P 500
[10:52] list uh and then we moved on to 2021
[10:56] 2022 where Salvador was also a big story
[10:59] uh with the first country now we have
[11:01] the Bitcoin ETF launch um what do you
[11:04] expect is like the the story of the next
[11:06] like even four to eight years what what
[11:08] what else of of adoption uh will come in
[11:12] there it's super difficult to tell uh so
[11:15] one thing is actually that I would
[11:17] probably dispute the fact that there's a
[11:19] lot of publicly traded companies that
[11:22] hold Bitcoin I I I remember seeing micro
[11:25] strategy buying uh Bitcoin in I I think
[11:29] it was late September October
[11:33] 2020 and I was sort of expecting wow
[11:36] they figured this out and subsequently
[11:39] price would work in favor of micro
[11:41] strategy and I was immediately thinking
[11:43] like uh one is a fool two is a a group
[11:48] but three is a party so it's like
[11:50] eagerly awaiting for the next ones to to
[11:53] Really join but I think to the extent
[11:56] that like obviously no one did it to the
[11:58] extent that Michael sailor uh and and
[12:00] micro strategy did but I'm just looking
[12:04] at this list now at Bitcoin treasuries
[12:07] and most of the companies that I know
[12:09] from this list have have
[12:11] some uh actually connection to the
[12:14] crypto space in in some way or
[12:16] form uh so basically what I'm I'm saying
[12:20] there is that the holding Bitcoin
[12:24] as an asset on your balance sheet is yet
[12:28] to be really adopted I feel like Elon
[12:32] musk's participation and that through
[12:34] SpaceX and and Tesla was more of a
[12:38] gimmick really um rather than it was
[12:41] real conviction as much as I adore Elon
[12:45] Musk for many of his really really good
[12:48] merits and I think he's a net positive
[12:51] in terms of innovation and
[12:53] Entrepreneurship and basically creating
[12:56] something the world has not seen before
[12:58] uh i' I've never really enjoyed his
[13:01] takes on on bitcoin too much it's it's
[13:04] like he he is he's a little bit to too
[13:09] quick on on the Judgment button there
[13:11] but potentially not putting in uh
[13:14] putting in the work in in educating
[13:16] himself
[13:17] fully um but nonetheless I I think
[13:21] adoption is is still to come um I'm very
[13:25] curious with what will happen now that
[13:28] uh I mean I mean micro strategy has a
[13:32] cost basis of their Bitcoin of 7.5
[13:36] billion and the current value of that is
[13:38] close to 14 uh right now so they almost
[13:42] double up nitting uh
[13:45] 1.8x on their initial
[13:47] investment this is absolutely
[13:51] astonishing and if Bitcoin will continue
[13:55] to unfold in in the way that I and many
[13:58] other Bitcoin Enthusiast and investors
[14:01] are thinking I mean this will be an
[14:04] absolute historical winning bet um the
[14:08] question is really how many CFOs and
[14:12] CEOs would look towards Michael sailor
[14:16] and think wait wait a minute that
[14:19] there's something going on there we had
[14:21] this company that was basically totally
[14:24] dead and now it's actually uh doing an
[14:28] alltime High on on the on the stock
[14:31] price I think this would be very much in
[14:33] the interest of a lot of people um who
[14:36] are sitting up on
[14:38] potentially Cash Cow companies that is
[14:41] losing influence or losed market share
[14:44] or has a limited market share with
[14:46] limited opportunity to grow um this is
[14:50] kind of a way to really leverage your
[14:52] vehicle um if that Trend will continue
[14:55] we're yet to see uh I have more hope for
[14:58] the the ETFs I think it will take time
[15:02] for uh so in the market you always you
[15:05] speak always about um what what what
[15:09] does news represent is it something that
[15:12] is either priced in or not and I have a
[15:15] way of thinking or a mental model for
[15:17] that if something is priced in on like
[15:20] if
[15:21] it's if it's shallow new so if like
[15:25] superficial something that can easily be
[15:27] digested
[15:29] it's it's very easy to determine whether
[15:31] is it priced in or not but if it's
[15:34] something like the ETFs that basically
[15:37] changes the whole dynamic of the market
[15:38] structure in Bitcoin and and the supply
[15:41] and demands uh
[15:43] mechanics I think it's it's not
[15:45] something that you can really expect
[15:47] that will be priced in uh on on the very
[15:50] short term so I have a lot more hope
[15:53] that the ETFs will uh essentially
[15:56] continue um to gobble up uh
[15:59] Bitcoin I think it's a matter of time
[16:03] before uh the ETFs potentially represent
[16:06] maybe 5 10% of the circulating supply of
[16:10] Bitcoin I think it's a matter of time um
[16:14] before Bitcoin will eventually hit a
[16:16] 100,000 and I think that will really
[16:18] ignite um interest in the space I mean
[16:21] if you are a traditional investor and
[16:24] you just if you discount how Bitcoin has
[16:27] behaved on the very long long term or
[16:29] look at it on a lock chart you basically
[16:32] see a chart that's going up and it's
[16:33] plummeting again and it's going up and
[16:35] it's going down again that's not
[16:38] something that brings a whole lot of
[16:40] comfort to to traditional investors
[16:43] so I think that break with 100K would
[16:47] kind of just as the previous praks on on
[16:49] bitcoin they look less and less
[16:52] important on the grand scheme of things
[16:54] unless you look at a lock chart er a
[16:58] break with a 100K would more or less
[17:00] move out that curve and and make it very
[17:02] obvious that that Bitcoin is is is
[17:06] moving actually in in in a direction and
[17:08] not just uh going up and down uh which
[17:12] is of course is also on the short term
[17:14] but naturally on the longer term it's
[17:15] it's moving up yeah amazing and and I
[17:18] think also uh I mean for for companies
[17:21] it's probably also easier to buy the
[17:24] ETFs than to buy Bitcoin themselves
[17:27] right so the a lot easier a lot easier
[17:31] um I sit in a country that has a fairly
[17:35] uh I would say flexible tax regime
[17:39] and uh accounting rules that
[17:43] are made to accommodate intangible
[17:47] assets and I can just tell from my own
[17:49] personal experience of having
[17:51] a a small modest holding company holding
[17:55] PTC on it its balance
[17:57] sheet it it's it's a cause for uh
[18:01] confusion among even great accountants
[18:04] not knowing fully uh how how to
[18:08] basically list the asset in in your
[18:10] accounting statements so um ETFs it's
[18:14] easier you basically buy an Financial
[18:16] instrument you can treat it as any other
[18:20] stock uh there can be some tax
[18:23] considerations that you need to do
[18:25] depending on where you're sitting but uh
[18:28] it it should be really really
[18:29] straightforward for for most people
[18:32] and um I
[18:35] think all the considerations with
[18:37] basically security I mean everyone has
[18:40] either heard read or even being close to
[18:45] someone who has uh up
[18:48] tremendously on their Bitcoin holding by
[18:51] either sending it to a wrong address uh
[18:54] throwing the seed phrase out sending the
[18:56] hard disk uh in a computer to the
[18:59] dumpster uh getting hacked getting
[19:02] things stolen physically I
[19:05] mean having things on Exchange has a a
[19:08] real benefit there that you don't like
[19:10] it's it's foolproof basically you don't
[19:12] need to you basically Outsourcing all of
[19:15] that of course you're paying a
[19:16] management fee to the to the ETF issuer
[19:20] but probably money well spent for a lot
[19:23] of people not technically adequate
[19:25] enough to to to do it on their own
[19:29] where does you see the the future of
[19:31] self custody because all the points that
[19:33] you mentioned are extremely lged uh a
[19:35] lot of people lost uh Bitcoin along the
[19:38] way especially in the early days uh it
[19:40] gets better with time as products and
[19:42] the services get better um but uh we
[19:46] also then see on the other side stuff
[19:49] like
[19:49] FDX uh it's also easier to get hacked
[19:53] when you're on an exchange rather than
[19:56] having it stored offline because most of
[19:58] stagram is kind of is is online uh how
[20:02] do you see like the the future going on
[20:04] for self custody will self custody be
[20:06] always be like a niche thing for like
[20:09] people that really want to take the
[20:10] freedom or can it be something where
[20:13] like 20 30 50% of the population
[20:16] actually holds their own
[20:18] key in an ideal world you would have as
[20:21] close to 100% holding their own Keys
[20:24] what I'm basically seeing now is kind of
[20:26] hybrid Solutions popping up where you
[20:29] can uh full infrastructure either have
[20:33] multi sick or have some sort of hybrid
[20:37] that allows you to basically store your
[20:39] Bitcoin through some platform but you
[20:41] are still the one responsible for the
[20:44] for the private key uh I think that is
[20:47] potentially the future because
[20:50] um yeah I I think a lot of the issues
[20:53] basically also come with convenience and
[20:55] and to be honest many of the
[20:59] uh Hardware wallets I mean they have
[21:02] improved over the years but it's not
[21:04] like it's they they really reinvented
[21:06] the ux wheel there in terms of making it
[21:09] user friendly uh before my mom would be
[21:15] able to easily do it I would not label
[21:18] it as something that is is mass Market
[21:21] uh
[21:22] appropriate um so I
[21:25] think I mean obviously there is an issue
[21:27] with Exchange being a
[21:30] Honeypot exchanges having faulty
[21:33] security risk measurements or just
[21:35] control functions internally I think
[21:38] issues such as we've seen with you
[21:40] cannot even call it issues but like
[21:42] fraud as you have seen as with FTX or
[21:47] similar type
[21:48] platforms uh is basically bringing the
[21:51] same kind of rigid control functions and
[21:56] procedures to those who are stewards of
[21:59] your
[22:00] assets
[22:02] um much like you have in the traditional
[22:05] markets I mean if if you're setting up
[22:07] an exchange or a bank I mean you really
[22:10] have to have your measurements in
[22:13] control you have like a whole list of
[22:15] procedures and risk functions and
[22:18] control uh considerations in place
[22:21] before you can do anything with with
[22:23] other people's money and I mean
[22:25] traditionally that's not been the case
[22:26] for crypto because it's just not been
[22:28] like Regulators have struggled to keep
[22:31] up uh know what's going on they have
[22:34] then
[22:35] issued I want to say very
[22:38] lightweight uh license schemes or legal
[22:41] Frameworks that would allow people to do
[22:43] exchange operations or uh wallets uh
[22:48] services but without no real oversight
[22:53] in what they're doing just with a label
[22:55] that hey we follow these very
[22:56] lightweight requirements from uh the
[23:00] supervisory authority of of the
[23:03] government and so this is like a yeah
[23:06] it's interesting to see and for me it's
[23:09] also interesting when we see uh
[23:11] companies evolving we have this also
[23:13] like Celsius and plf it kind of gets
[23:16] more popular Al right now as as the
[23:18] price runs up with the field um finding
[23:22] um what's also like maybe let's take a
[23:24] step back also really interesting for me
[23:26] is uh the coinbase honeybot as you
[23:28] mentioned like the big centralization
[23:31] and honey pots being implemented it's
[23:33] also like big risk for for the coinbase
[23:36] itself because they have to invest a lot
[23:37] in security I guess uh when they have so
[23:40] much money from the ETFs but also they
[23:42] are like really popular exchange so they
[23:44] have even without the ETFs a lot of
[23:45] money uh which will also like then get
[23:49] even greater than that and most of the
[23:51] ETFs As I understood it use coin Bas
[23:54] some do self custody some use other
[23:57] exchanges uh
[23:59] um do you see any any risks for for that
[24:02] is there something that you worried
[24:06] about I mean yeah wow uh coinbase is
[24:09] certainly positioning themselves well in
[24:12] terms of being a a costy provider in the
[24:16] space now um basically nine like 90% of
[24:20] the ETF I think there like gini
[24:23] and uh Fidelity has their own solution
[24:26] and then bitco is basically what what's
[24:29] on the market now but I think eight out
[24:31] of 11 cases is coinbase so it's really
[24:36] positioning itself as as quite the
[24:38] potential Achilles heel I would say so
[24:42] uh thoughts out to Brian Armstrong I
[24:45] really hope that you have your custody
[24:48] uh Team uh on with a lot of coffee
[24:52] running and and O oats in the morning uh
[24:56] because that's a big responsibility I
[24:58] certainly hope so um I mean obviously
[25:01] it's a little bit against the Bitcoin
[25:03] Mantra and I would hope
[25:05] also that that would spread out more
[25:10] like more of the ETFs would potentially
[25:13] diversify uh in the future the issue
[25:15] there is just that I mean it's a margins
[25:18] play if you think about it just from the
[25:19] ETF point of view I mean the lowest uh
[25:23] price points you have right now is uh I
[25:27] think that is is bitwise that's the
[25:30] that's the lowest priced one at like
[25:32] 0.2% or something like that right at
[25:36] least that's in the range like
[25:38] 015 or 0 point like 15 to 20 basis point
[25:42] I I top of my mind that's the cheapest
[25:45] management fee if you think about how
[25:48] cheap that basically is to run an
[25:50] operation where you store everything you
[25:53] have uh all the measurements in place to
[25:56] safeguard other people's ass Assets in a
[25:58] good
[25:59] manner that's insanely cheap it really
[26:02] is cheap I mean I've been part of
[26:04] negotiating fairly large cost agreements
[26:07] with the bigger supply suppliers such as
[26:09] fire blocks or copper or so forth I
[26:15] mean without disclosing the their fee
[26:18] schedules I can say that you would
[26:20] actually struggle getting a similar feed
[26:22] directly with the custody provider so I
[26:26] think
[26:27] as uh uh basically competition arises
[26:30] cost play is one of the sectors that
[26:34] really has faced a overhaul in terms of
[26:37] competition like fire blocks copper
[26:42] bitco uh just to mention a few are like
[26:46] bofs now uh in terms of assets on the
[26:49] management
[26:51] and it's a real potential long-term Cash
[26:54] Cow so obviously it also attracts a lot
[26:57] of interest interest from Venture
[27:00] investors valuations and of each of
[27:02] these companies are like magnitudes
[27:05] higher than the first cost of dis
[27:06] Solutions you saw uh going back to the
[27:10] previous cycle um so I'm expecting
[27:14] competition to increase there I think
[27:17] the increase in competition will
[27:19] essentially lower fees over time that's
[27:21] almost bound to happen um if Fe
[27:24] schedules are going down it means also
[27:27] that they will
[27:29] be a better reason for potentially ETFs
[27:34] or exchanges to not do things on their
[27:37] own but just pick someone off the shelf
[27:40] and hopefully not all of them will pick
[27:42] coinbase who probably have from from the
[27:45] list of ETF probably have managed to
[27:48] secure the best um pricing schedule I
[27:52] think that would be one variable another
[27:54] one would just be that they are listed
[27:56] on the American Stock Exchange I mean
[27:58] there's more
[27:59] control um being listed as a stock on
[28:04] the American uh Stock Exchange I mean
[28:08] the that always like already comes with
[28:11] a lot of scrutiny so imagine if you
[28:15] are a financial institution and you're
[28:19] now going to apply for an ETF I mean are
[28:21] you going to designate binance who has
[28:25] located God knows where on the custody
[28:28] part of the entity or pick some supplier
[28:33] that's like a hybrid that says like yeah
[28:35] we're not fully qualified custodian uh
[28:38] because we hold your like you hold your
[28:40] own keys but we Supply the software all
[28:44] will you just go with a supplier that's
[28:45] actually gone through all the scrutiny
[28:47] that you would face when you when you go
[28:49] on the NASDAQ exchange I mean it's
[28:52] almost a no-brainer if if price
[28:54] schedules are even the same and
[28:57] potentially
[28:58] favorable for coinbase so I think before
[29:01] we see Dynamics change that they would
[29:04] probably continue to be a honey poot and
[29:06] fingers crossed they have this stuff in
[29:09] order definitely I hope so uh and it's
[29:12] interesting to imagine like uh maybe
[29:15] let's play this this scenario out that
[29:17] there's something happening with with
[29:19] with coinbase uh like it's also like
[29:22] depends on what happened like there can
[29:24] be a small thing happening uh where they
[29:27] can maybe like step in and do something
[29:30] about it maybe a lot of things happening
[29:32] where like a big chunk of the Bitcoin
[29:35] maybe even gets stolen um I mean this
[29:37] would be movie Material I think if if
[29:40] something like that happens uh and God
[29:42] knows who what what happens there but uh
[29:45] is do you have any um Theory where like
[29:48] when something happens uh this is this
[29:51] something like basically what we seen
[29:53] with FDX but in a similar scale I mean
[29:56] you could basically say that that's a
[29:58] Black Swan uh event or some some some
[30:02] risk that has a extremely low
[30:05] probability I think the probability of
[30:08] such an event happening will will be
[30:10] lower over time but if it happens I mean
[30:12] it's absolute devastation to the market
[30:15] uh especially if it happens again the
[30:18] granular scale that of of FTX I mean I
[30:22] think a lot of investors still has not
[30:24] struck off uh what happened in 22 with
[30:28] with FTX
[30:30] so yeah let's not hope we're in for a
[30:34] third one we have Mount GX and we have
[30:36] FTX of of a bigger magnitude situations
[30:40] obviously a lot of other smaller
[30:42] exchanges are blowing up uh much more
[30:45] often uh but that's not of the same
[30:50] importance as if you have something
[30:51] really almost instrumental piece of
[30:54] infrastructure to the to the industry uh
[30:57] so so yeah if that happens I mean all
[31:00] bets off uh will Bitcoin survive it
[31:03] obviously it will it's it's a resilient
[31:06] asent it's not really bitcoin's fault
[31:09] that the people storing it does not have
[31:11] the
[31:13] essentially security aspects of their
[31:16] business or control functions of their
[31:17] business under control but it's
[31:20] certainly something that harms Bitcoin I
[31:22] mean how many headlines didn't you see
[31:23] that was basically fauling Bitcoin for
[31:26] what happened at the at at FTX so let's
[31:30] not hope that that will never happen
[31:32] again um I don't think it's a big risk
[31:36] uh but obviously I I also thought that
[31:39] with the third like first lesson of
[31:41] Mount GX that the likelihood of that
[31:43] happening and a granular scale again
[31:46] super small but yet it did happen yeah
[31:49] and it's it's interesting how this all
[31:51] evolves and we talked a little bit about
[31:53] volatility also before uh and you said
[31:55] like the the when bigger money
[31:59] institutional money comes in they they
[32:01] want to see like
[32:02] the asset being not as volatile and
[32:05] seeing a directional move and not the
[32:07] the crazy up and downs um and we seen
[32:11] obviously through cycle and cycle that
[32:14] the volatility actually goes down uh a
[32:18] little bit with the the crazy crashes
[32:20] when we compare it like really early on
[32:22] to 2012 13 14 to now the crashes I mean
[32:27] maybe there some something bigger
[32:28] cominging when do you imagine like the
[32:30] volatility being slower when we hit like
[32:34] a million I mean there's always like I
[32:36] even had guests on that uh um already
[32:39] said that the volatility is about to get
[32:42] even crazier like in the future that
[32:44] we've not seen uh the major volatility
[32:47] which does not make sense for me because
[32:49] when there's more money in the system
[32:51] it's should be more stable than that
[32:54] what's your take on volatility and the
[32:56] Outlook of that like in the next like
[32:58] maybe five 10 even 20 years
[33:01] um I think I mean I don't see the
[33:05] argument why bitcoin's volatility would
[33:08] increase now I mean on the short term
[33:10] for sure you have basically a volatility
[33:13] chart of Bitcoin being like swinging in
[33:16] a range and then all of a sudden oof big
[33:18] move is happening this is how Bitcoin is
[33:20] behaving it basically
[33:23] trades with very little movement up and
[33:26] down and then comes a move Mo in in
[33:28] either direction uh pretty rapidly and
[33:31] and everyone is surprised when it
[33:34] happens
[33:35] um I think volatility on on like the
[33:39] longer scale is is bound to decrease uh
[33:42] I remember doing some modeling and even
[33:44] benchmarking some of my modeling to what
[33:46] I saw out there in the space I was
[33:49] basically trying to figure out a point
[33:51] when Bitcoin would have the same
[33:52] volatility as the US
[33:55] dollar uh I think actually year was like
[33:58] 2028 or something like this based on
[34:02] modeling but this is like years ago um I
[34:05] think that's that's not going to happen
[34:07] I think volatility will persist for
[34:09] longer and fall much longer probably uh
[34:12] than that um I don't know really I like
[34:18] the bigger the the more volum the bigger
[34:20] the market capitalization of the entire
[34:23] Bitcoin network is the the less like the
[34:26] more it what it basically takes take to
[34:28] move the market
[34:30] uh so if you ask me I mean volatility is
[34:33] a gift
[34:34] for people seeking Bitcoin exposure
[34:38] because it over long time frames work in
[34:40] your favor I mean there's more up days
[34:42] than than down dayss and on the longer
[34:45] time Horizons bitcoin price is
[34:47] increasing so volatility is like a
[34:51] double Ed sord that you have to have
[34:54] some a certainty to and and you need to
[34:58] basically consider in your approach in
[35:01] investing and taking exposure but um
[35:05] really it is something that works in
[35:07] your favor I told you a lot about 21
[35:09] Bitcoin the best place for me to buy
[35:12] Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin only
[35:14] exchange but now let's talk about how to
[35:17] secure your Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin
[35:19] you don't want to leave them on Exchange
[35:21] you want to take self custody you want
[35:24] to take responsibility of your own
[35:27] Bitcoin that's why I recommend getting a
[35:30] bitbox bitbox is an amazing wallet where
[35:33] you can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[35:36] simple way very secure you can even
[35:38] create a passphrase with that passphrase
[35:41] you can basically create a hidden wallet
[35:44] on the device itself make sure to buy
[35:48] your bitbox in the link down in the
[35:50] description and with code Robin you even
[35:52] get a 5% discount yeah definitely I also
[35:55] think like uh I think Michael said at in
[35:58] 2020 the volatility is the price you pay
[36:00] for for the massive upside you get in
[36:03] the next uh couple of years uh and it's
[36:06] interesting uh Feud interesting
[36:09] perspective to think about volatility
[36:11] because obviously um not everybody is uh
[36:14] scratched out for volatility I have many
[36:16] friends and colleagues uh that were like
[36:19] because it's so volatile they were
[36:21] shaking off they're like oh I cannot
[36:23] handle this I cannot handle my my
[36:25] portfolio going up and down that much uh
[36:27] so then I always like yeah come in later
[36:30] but pay like 5x 10x 20x the price like
[36:34] it's your decision if if you like
[36:36] Bitcoin it's early is always better um
[36:39] but uh maybe let's come back to the
[36:42] because you also wrote about regulatory
[36:44] landscape in in your articles with ETFs
[36:46] and stuff like that um and we have a lot
[36:49] going on we have the ETFs going on but
[36:51] then also we have the EU saying uh stuff
[36:54] about un hosted wallets trying to limit
[36:56] uh stuff like that then we have the MAA
[36:58] coming in the EU uh and there's a lot of
[37:02] things playing at the same time with
[37:05] Bitcoin um where do you where where are
[37:08] we right now with with regulatory
[37:10] especially when you are like so early in
[37:12] there with 2012 which is impressive uh
[37:15] how did this evolve and how do you see
[37:17] it right now uh Bitcoin and Regulators
[37:22] are always trying to keep up with
[37:24] Innovation right and this has been like
[37:27] a
[37:28] something not just a new uh new
[37:32] innovation or something like this but
[37:34] this is like conceptually
[37:37] challenging existing models and existing
[37:40] Frameworks of how you basically provide
[37:43] legal guidance and and framework for how
[37:46] how stuff should be
[37:49] um H how The Regulators would basically
[37:52] guide you and restrict you and limit you
[37:54] from doing certain actions uh and how
[37:57] they would stipulate you doing others so
[38:00] they're basically playing a catch sh up
[38:02] game there um obviously very little
[38:06] regulation in the beginning uh when I
[38:08] first stumbled upon Bitcoin now is
[38:11] something else is still not to a point
[38:13] where Regulators can really encapsulate
[38:15] everything that's going on I think there
[38:18] I mean with the ETFs that's basically a
[38:21] big stamp of approval on bitcoin as an
[38:23] ass class it's basically the SEC
[38:28] also ruling out
[38:29] Bitcoin uh being a security it's also a
[38:33] big step because it's not it's not a
[38:36] security uh yet even those arguments
[38:38] were made earlier um so where is it
[38:42] where where is the regulatory
[38:44] environment moving um I think it's a
[38:46] little bit of a pendulum I fear that in
[38:50] the wake of FTX and everything that went
[38:53] on there that potentially the regulatory
[38:55] swing is swimming too much in the
[38:58] direction of of regulatory action and
[39:01] the issue with a regulator I mean I'm
[39:04] I'm saying they're playing a catchup
[39:05] game but the reason is that they're
[39:07] playing a catchup game is natural right
[39:09] they cannot be on the Forefront of
[39:10] innovation if so they would be
[39:12] innovators and they're definitely not
[39:15] innovators they are uh they're trying to
[39:19] encapsulate what is going on in the
[39:21] Innovation space in the in the world
[39:25] um so
[39:28] when things happen in in the market
[39:30] Regulators are forced to take action so
[39:33] when you have devastating things or you
[39:35] have new stories or when basically just
[39:38] the stakes get higher I mean market
[39:39] capitalization is much like Bitcoin also
[39:42] only going in One Direction and this is
[39:44] for the entire crypto industry also only
[39:47] moving in in One Direction so uh the
[39:50] higher the stakes the the bigger the
[39:53] risk uh also so uh I think it's only
[39:57] that regulator is really trying
[39:59] everything in their power to do this
[40:02] what what I could fear is as I was
[40:04] saying that the pendulum would basically
[40:06] always swing in the direction of that
[40:08] they try to play catch up too quickly
[40:11] for something they do not understand fly
[40:14] uh yet it's almost better to be a little
[40:19] hesitant and try to guide the markets as
[40:22] well as you can not to over regulate and
[40:25] trying to put up frame work that doesn't
[40:28] make sense for the industry because it
[40:30] it's it's it's clearly written by
[40:32] someone who doesn't know what what's
[40:34] going on uh this I could fear uh a
[40:37] little bit could be going on but I mean
[40:41] we we're here to see right we also have
[40:45] like
[40:47] cbdcs being a thing I mean I remember
[40:50] seeing the first test cases of that
[40:52] being rolled out in 2019 and 2020 that's
[40:57] still not something that you see on a
[41:00] granular scale in the Western World
[41:02] being rolled out but I assume basically
[41:06] that there is a plan in place
[41:10] to eventually replace the fat money that
[41:14] is in existence right now with with uh
[41:17] digital currency like real digital
[41:19] currency with unique Footprints which
[41:22] basically what cbdcs are
[41:26] um so with that coming into play I I
[41:28] think Regulators will more or less try
[41:32] to box in what a cbdc is with what a lot
[41:37] of different cryptos
[41:40] are um they will probably struggle with
[41:43] that because I mean I I
[41:45] think the bigger offices in the states
[41:48] like the cftc and the SEC has basically
[41:51] now faced that not all digital assets
[41:54] are born equal are probably claim that
[41:58] 90% of them are more less just like
[42:00] Securities there some team that had an
[42:02] idea they put it the Innovation out
[42:05] there if you invest to buy the token
[42:07] you're basically like the team will
[42:09] basically benefit from that and you as a
[42:11] token holder is basically benefiting
[42:13] from uh from the team's performance so
[42:16] it doesn't really pass the how we test
[42:18] in in in that
[42:20] sense um but a lot of them are also
[42:23] something like hybrids or something in
[42:24] between is it a commodity is like a Hy
[42:27] asset between a commodity and security
[42:30] where aspects of that are like cross
[42:33] overing um your question was what what
[42:36] what will happen and what do I expect I
[42:38] mean it it's very difficult to know I I
[42:41] I try to really not get in the minds of
[42:43] of regulators at this point I've been
[42:46] wrong so many times uh thinking what
[42:49] what will happen I thought um basically
[42:52] that the hammer would come down crushing
[42:55] hard on bitcoin before ETFs were
[42:58] basically approved that didn't happen um
[43:03] I
[43:04] mean there are some some worrying
[43:06] signals in terms of self- custody now I
[43:08] noticed uh some exchanges are now being
[43:12] forced to basically do certification uh
[43:16] from what's called travel rules so
[43:19] essentially if you would draw an amount
[43:21] larger than I think the threshold is
[43:23] like $10,000 or €10,000 or something
[43:26] like this
[43:27] and you do it to a self custodi wallet
[43:30] you have to
[43:32] basically sign a box with the exchange
[43:34] saying this is sent out to me uh so that
[43:38] they can basically label that like that
[43:40] is basically mapping out the
[43:42] decentralized network right that they're
[43:44] mapping out the wallet addresses in your
[43:47] name um so that's something not seen in
[43:51] the past um I think basically this this
[43:56] like there will be a war on on self-
[43:58] costed Solutions uh more and more I
[44:01] think
[44:02] identification is something Regulators
[44:04] will really seek more of in the market
[44:07] is this KC and uh as you described it
[44:10] right now kind of an attack on bitcoin
[44:13] or just like an uh an an try to make the
[44:19] new
[44:20] system compatible with the old
[44:23] system you could claim so because uh I
[44:27] mean the initial idea is a peer-to-peer
[44:30] electronic money I mean when I hand you
[44:35] a 50e
[44:37] bill there's no Lock Storage or
[44:41] identification of the two entities that
[44:44] basically did that exchange that's the
[44:46] idea of bringing that digital making it
[44:50] unique while having a monetary policy
[44:53] that was
[44:54] scarce I mean
[44:57] yeah I I I I I see it a little bit as an
[45:01] attack because it's attack on on privacy
[45:04] and it's an attack on privacy that is
[45:06] not
[45:08] fully um I mean the exchanges if you
[45:12] transfer let's s say you you transfer an
[45:15] ungodly amount to exchanges you transfer
[45:18] from you open a new exchange account and
[45:20] you you send 100 million worth of
[45:24] bitcoin to that exchange immediately I
[45:26] think it's fair that the exchange as a
[45:29] central counterparty is basically doing
[45:31] source of funds on that money for them
[45:33] because they have a regulatory regime
[45:36] they have to fall under and do their do
[45:38] diligence but when you're sending out
[45:41] your
[45:42] money I don't think it's fair to uh to
[45:46] basically ask for the same kind like
[45:48] this just my general um General opinion
[45:52] on on the AML which is is what
[45:56] essentially is
[45:57] AML policies that they don't think it's
[45:59] fair that you do the same kind of
[46:00] scrutiny on money going out as money
[46:02] coming in uh so I I don't get that I
[46:06] mean if you wish to hold your Bitcoin
[46:08] off any centralized counterparties I
[46:11] mean you should be happy to do so uh
[46:14] without taking extra measurements and
[46:17] because this the whole idea you you own
[46:19] the asset
[46:21] right it's the same kind of stupidity
[46:24] happening when when I hear here now that
[46:27] banks are very uh in Denmark which is my
[46:31] uh country of of origin I mean there's
[46:33] now a rule in place with a limit of
[46:37] €2,000 so you can basically withdraw
[46:40] cash from the bank off amount €2,000 if
[46:44] you do it or if you wish for more you
[46:47] basically have to
[46:49] uh do a a self um self assessment or
[46:54] basically tell the bank where how you're
[46:56] going to spend that Capital they also
[46:59] enforce laws as far as I know that if
[47:02] even if I'm to buy a used car from you
[47:05] um I can also only pay you in cash
[47:10] €2,000 everything above that in the
[47:13] sales sum of the car I would have to do
[47:16] wire a wi wire transfer so I mean it's
[47:19] it's obvious that there is
[47:21] a a demand for greater control over
[47:25] money spent uh and that trickles down
[47:28] into the crypto economy as
[47:30] well yeah it's uh it's it's for me as
[47:33] you described it s to see because uh
[47:35] honestly when someone uh buys a car from
[47:39] someone else uh use car for like I don't
[47:42] know
[47:43] 15,000 uh it's none of your business why
[47:47] like this is you should not like the
[47:49] state that's an honest transaction
[47:52] between uh two human beings that should
[47:56] not face grp scy and I
[47:58] mean if they didn't have a a problem
[48:01] with your money being on the account and
[48:03] the way you earned it how can they have
[48:06] a problem with with the way they they
[48:08] pull it out and I mean the banks are not
[48:10] fully to fault there the banks are
[48:12] basically just extending the policy of
[48:17] uh of the states and the financial
[48:19] Regulators
[48:20] so I mean you could argue that that
[48:22] banks are more or less to the same
[48:25] degree bureaucrats as as the the state
[48:28] is but that that's another story that's
[48:30] that's more a political viewpoint on on
[48:32] my end but um at least they're
[48:37] really yeah control is is is something
[48:40] they crave more uh identification is
[48:44] something they crave more privacy is
[48:46] something they wish to elude and
[48:48] basically remove from uh the
[48:50] transactional flow between humans and
[48:53] entities U this trickles down into
[48:55] crypto you've seen all the major privacy
[48:58] coins they already got Dlisted and
[48:59] banned and and whatnot from various
[49:02] centralized exchange and that's
[49:04] basically because they pose a super big
[49:06] issue on this particular aspect of
[49:09] anonymity and privacy because you can
[49:12] basically not do uh put the chain
[49:15] analysis or elliptic software down on
[49:18] the chain and follow okay if we've
[49:20] identified this wallet how have you then
[49:22] spent the the pattern uh afterwards um
[49:25] so
[49:27] yeah it's a real issue I I fear it uh as
[49:31] a theme for the future basically also
[49:33] just taking it brought out from money
[49:35] but also how the internet is used how
[49:38] information is conveyed how surveillance
[49:40] is now increasing
[49:43] um privacy is a cavet of the past and
[49:47] it's something that we don't really
[49:50] understand the value of until it fades
[49:53] and when it fades it will be very very
[49:56] difficult to
[49:58] regain yeah that's uh I like that
[50:02] sentence a lot uh and when we think of
[50:06] as we said also with cdbc is I have a
[50:09] lot of interesting discussions already
[50:11] on the podcast about
[50:13] cbdcs um and I even had one guy on that
[50:16] said like cbdcs are exactly a trojan
[50:20] horse for Bitcoin because the
[50:21] governments are saying this digital
[50:24] wallet uh this digital wallet has value
[50:27] uh and introducing basically the masses
[50:29] to something digital uh and then the
[50:32] jump to bitcoin as people see there the
[50:35] better store value because CBC still
[50:37] have a bad monetary system like it's
[50:39] it's it's still not like it's not better
[50:41] than feed and in that regard from a
[50:43] monetary aspect at least I don't think
[50:46] so um worse it's in worse yeah and then
[50:50] people have a natural flow uh towards
[50:53] Bitcoin when they already are introduced
[50:56] by governments in a mass way to to a
[50:59] cbdc see this is also the interesting
[51:02] part and you you ask me for what was
[51:05] some of the surprises I've had I've had
[51:08] a surprise with Bitcoin and that's
[51:10] basically been how slow the adoption has
[51:12] been I mean you can argue that the
[51:14] potentially the amount of Bitcoin users
[51:16] is kind of like plus 50% yearly or
[51:19] something like I've seen some estimates
[51:21] that that is the uh count that super
[51:24] difficult to measure by the way but
[51:26] let's just go with that number let's say
[51:27] it's just double digit uh growth on
[51:31] bitcoin adoption every year I have been
[51:35] astonished how the the flipping point of
[51:38] Bitcoin is yet to really be here you can
[51:42] argue that it's potentially now that
[51:44] this is now essentially finally that
[51:46] point at the S curve adoption where
[51:49] things really take off uh but I think
[51:52] just there's so many things going on in
[51:54] the world that really like
[51:57] unfunded
[51:59] Wars uh
[52:01] inflation government
[52:03] spending uh privacy attacks issue with
[52:07] like Sovereign ownership of asset like
[52:10] your your self ownership of assets I
[52:13] mean there's so many Trends in societies
[52:16] basically pointing towards this
[52:18] particular phenomenon which Bitcoin
[52:20] really is and it has been my surprise
[52:23] that the real Tipping Point or the real
[52:26] ignition of Bitcoin has not really
[52:28] happened yet uh it's still a niche
[52:32] phenomenon it's still only valued at
[52:34] like 10% of gold which I think is like
[52:38] hysterical you have assets out there uh
[52:41] like big stocks big individual companies
[52:44] that are worth more than the entire
[52:46] Bitcoin Network that is ridiculous if
[52:49] you ask me that like Bitcoin should be
[52:51] worth so much more um but that's that's
[52:55] uh that's just something thing I'm I'm
[52:57] puzzled about I
[53:00] mean investment Theory would also say or
[53:04] good old saying there is like you can
[53:07] you can be right but your timing might
[53:10] be be wrong I mean like potentially we
[53:12] all right about Bitcoin but that
[53:14] particular Tipping Point is only like 10
[53:16] years away or 20 years away uh I think
[53:19] it's very natural to overestimate what
[53:21] will happen in just a few years time and
[53:24] then uh you maybe lose track of the
[53:26] bigger picture if you really look out
[53:29] decade or two in in the past even like a
[53:31] generation out in the past in the future
[53:34] sorry um yeah yeah definitely and it's
[53:38] also interesting for me when we look at
[53:41] adoption uh and when you come in you
[53:44] always have this like oh I figured
[53:46] this out like this and I have to buy so
[53:49] so many Bitcoins now because what if and
[53:51] tomorrow everybody figures it out like
[53:54] you have this fear of like missing out
[53:56] all of the sudden but then you come in
[53:58] and then you see it like oh it's not
[54:00] that fast oh The World Is Still uh going
[54:04] around and is still going as as usual
[54:07] and when you talk with friends they
[54:09] having a lot of uh interesting or stupid
[54:12] opinions on on on bitcoin why they don't
[54:14] want to buy it uh and I mean my
[54:18] environment got really orange build
[54:20] really Bitcoin ified it's it's hard for
[54:22] me to to find people that are completely
[54:25] outside of Bitcoin my family is is
[54:27] warming up a lot to to bitcoin uh but
[54:30] yeah I've been talking about it four
[54:32] years now so it's like not not a
[54:34] representative family I guess um but for
[54:37] the general population I still believe
[54:40] the pain is just not big enough do you
[54:42] is is it is it Dad like this that people
[54:45] are not Str fa that's a fair argument
[54:48] that that things have to really hurt uh
[54:51] before you're willing to to look for
[54:54] an an alternative I
[54:57] mean in a sense the internet is doing a
[55:01] lot for information flow like uh it's
[55:05] it's possible for anyone anywhere to
[55:07] educate thems about any topic as long as
[55:11] they have an internet connection and I
[55:13] think
[55:14] the like just the issue or around
[55:19] say government stipulated Monet monetary
[55:24] policy inflation as as a
[55:27] theme uh is is something that I think
[55:29] the general public is really being aware
[55:32] of I mean I'm I'm 32 years old and and
[55:36] like the last couple of years is the
[55:38] first time where I've really like notely
[55:41] felt inflation firsthand
[55:44] um in my lifetime and I think a lot of
[55:49] people uh have actually felt that in in
[55:52] on their
[55:53] lives I think that is basically craving
[55:57] uh posing questions for people and and
[56:00] the questions are very easy to answer if
[56:02] you're willing to put in I mean just a
[56:04] handful of hours and educate yourself
[56:06] using just YouTube Google like whatever
[56:09] sources you you you find natural for
[56:13] getting the information
[56:15] and yeah definitely and it's impressive
[56:18] that you got Bitcoin uh since
[56:21] 2012 uh um just like how how did you get
[56:25] it so early like uh I mean for me it was
[56:28] hard because like I was just I think 13
[56:30] or 14 years old but how did you get
[56:32] Bitcoin in 2012
[56:35] um that's I I regrettably I cannot
[56:38] really remember how the concept of
[56:41] Bitcoin popped up I think it was a
[56:44] friend of mine that discovered it first
[56:46] on on the Internet or something like
[56:48] that and at that time I mean we were
[56:51] already deep
[56:52] down uh I think when was the first site
[56:55] Guist the movie the first one I'm
[56:58] interested to see that that's like 2007
[57:01] 2008 okay so basically I
[57:04] think a lot of the questions and the
[57:06] contrary thinking and like the critical
[57:09] thinking came with those first sist
[57:11] movies that that makes
[57:13] sense uh that came to a question of
[57:16] basically monetary policy and out of
[57:19] that spawned a technological phenomenon
[57:21] and mean I've always been a somewhat of
[57:24] a nerdy fellow you know I've I've
[57:26] interested in technology interested in
[57:28] technology Trends what's going on
[57:30] tinkering with computers since I was
[57:32] very small uh so seeing like a
[57:37] technological phenomenon trying to solve
[57:39] a financial issue or like a structural
[57:41] issue for society was quite
[57:44] interesting um much like anyone else
[57:48] that discovered Bitcoin early I I
[57:50] obviously did all the same
[57:52] mistakes of having Bitcoin basically not
[57:56] buying enough was the first issue um I
[58:00] didn't have a lot of money at the time
[58:02] uh so I didn't really have the like the
[58:05] capacity to to even do so but um and
[58:09] then essentially just selling it too
[58:11] early and and I I completely faded it uh
[58:14] when Mount GX blew up I was like
[58:16] this this is like this this is the end
[58:20] of it this is not supposed to happen I I
[58:22] remember really feeling anger and for
[58:26] frustration uh when that happened and
[58:28] then I basically just left it alone for
[58:30] a few years which was arguably the
[58:32] second biggest mistake like leaving the
[58:35] space from probably
[58:38] 2013
[58:40] until mid
[58:42] 2016 then all of a sudden I I I mean I I
[58:45] checked in on it every now and again but
[58:47] it was like slumping around like Bitcoin
[58:48] is dead whatever is not moving around
[58:52] and you can say anything I mean I I
[58:54] could also stay on top of H schol going
[58:56] on in the community but the the Bitcoin
[58:58] price is really also in in some sense a
[59:01] health indicator because it shows the
[59:04] interest in in the in the underlying
[59:06] asset of the protocol um I faded it then
[59:10] and and came back in mid end 2016 when
[59:16] when things started to move again and
[59:18] then uh I didn't leave since essentially
[59:21] like I was I was part of the journey
[59:23] since set up an asset manager
[59:27] in
[59:29] 20177 uh that essentially turned into me
[59:33] relocating to
[59:34] Cyprus uh and setting up a investment
[59:39] fund I exited that fund later in 21 sold
[59:43] my shares or parted ways with the
[59:46] company
[59:48] um then since then I've just been like
[59:52] private Venture Builder and investor in
[59:55] the space I'm now involved with a a
[59:58] payments uh fintech startup called
[60:01] peanuts where we're basically trying to
[60:04] solve some of the issu we just covered
[60:06] here with with banking I mean it's not
[60:08] like we're
[60:09] not like running below uh regulatory
[60:13] Frameworks and stuff like this and need
[60:14] to follow the same AML and kyc
[60:16] guidelines but essentially what we're
[60:19] trying to build is like a financial hop
[60:21] where the customer acceptance policy is
[60:25] not set in Stone where where there's
[60:28] different shoes for different feet for a
[60:30] reason and this is how we try to model
[60:32] our system as well so basically what we
[60:34] do is that we integrate with a number of
[60:37] different financial institutions and
[60:40] based on the ones that basically have
[60:42] are good with e-commerce or accept
[60:43] e-commerce or accept crypto businesses
[60:46] or accept retail clients doing crypto
[60:50] transactions or whatever we can
[60:52] basically have a like Supply the full
[60:56] customer facing application with all the
[60:58] middleware but all the plumbing is
[61:00] basically different for each uh
[61:03] individual entity based on their needs
[61:05] and and what they're really looking for
[61:08] so uh this is what I'm building right
[61:10] now and um very involved with with the
[61:15] digital Assets in general my heart and
[61:18] and passion is a lot with investing also
[61:22] so I'm also investing in as an angel
[61:25] investor and doing wealth advisory and
[61:29] investing in early stage projects and
[61:31] funds and basically um spending a lot of
[61:35] time on on what's really going on in the
[61:36] industry right now I'm very um
[61:39] interested in what's going on in the
[61:40] whole Bitcoin ecosystem because the
[61:42] longer I've stayed in the space the more
[61:44] I kind of gravitate towards Bitcoin I
[61:47] remember in 2016 17 I became like an
[61:51] ultra ethereum uh supporter and thinking
[61:55] ah is great because it kind of solves
[61:57] all of these problem with scalability
[61:59] and smart contracts that Bitcoin
[62:04] didn't bit Bitcoin basically didn't have
[62:07] the capacity
[62:08] for then as time has progressed I've
[62:12] kind of I would not say left that alone
[62:15] but I have like designated or developed
[62:19] my mental thinking so that it's not
[62:23] really a catch all there's not really
[62:24] one winning project in entire industry
[62:26] is like multiple different sectors in
[62:29] the
[62:30] industry I think the killer one for that
[62:33] is basically uh Bitcoin so Bitcoin is
[62:36] probably going to attain the biggest
[62:38] market share um for a long time of the
[62:42] entire Market uh ethereum would be
[62:45] probably one of the winning ones in in
[62:47] the smart application uh framework and
[62:51] and offering a hub for decentralized
[62:54] applications
[62:56] um but I'm very interested in what's
[62:57] basically going on in the Bitcoin
[62:59] ecosystem now with basically people it
[63:02] it fell a lot since last year that
[63:04] Bitcoin really had a reignition on what
[63:07] is going on in Bitcoin ecosystem people
[63:09] trying to basically build side
[63:11] chains uh Services lending protocols uh
[63:17] custody platforms wallet Solutions
[63:20] around Bitcoin um I'm very interested in
[63:23] that and have also placed a few
[63:25] strategic bets
[63:27] on on on that but with part of my
[63:30] portfolio um so very excited to see
[63:34] where where that will be headed uh so
[63:36] far it's looking uh like that is one of
[63:38] the I I think that's going to be one of
[63:40] the narratives of this also bull market
[63:43] if people are looking for alha I I think
[63:46] that is that is one of the um probably
[63:51] bigger Alpha plays that is taking
[63:54] basically a Leverage Bitcoin bit through
[63:58] various types of infrastructure in and
[64:01] around Bitcoin yeah definitely Bitcoin
[64:04] industry is like uh that that's that's
[64:06] the place to be when you want to be in
[64:08] something really cool in the next like
[64:10] five years um it's also interesting as
[64:14] you mentioned uh uh suprus uh really
[64:18] quick before we come to the end of the
[64:20] the podcast uh what's your thoughts
[64:22] around El Salvador adopting Bitcoin like
[64:25] the first now what has it been three
[64:27] years I think since they officially
[64:29] announced it MH I mean regrettably I've
[64:33] not yet put my feet on the ground in in
[64:36] in El Salvador that's uh something I
[64:40] hope to achieve end of the year um
[64:44] before end of the year I would like to
[64:46] visit El
[64:48] Salvador um I think it's really bold
[64:51] move I see El Salvador political Reg
[64:55] seem receiving a lot of scrutiny
[64:57] especially now from the IMF uh lately um
[65:03] I'm not sure that the day-to-day
[65:04] adoption among the population has really
[65:07] gotten a hold
[65:09] and I'm not sure it will for
[65:12] theable time but basically just removing
[65:15] the fraction or not fraction friction
[65:18] removing the friction towards basically
[65:21] adopting Bitcoin and integrating Bitcoin
[65:24] in the monetary system I think it's
[65:27] astonishing uh much like what we
[65:29] discussed earlier I had the
[65:31] same exact feeling when El Salvador or
[65:36] when uh it was announced at the Bitcoin
[65:39] conference that El Salvador is now
[65:42] adopting Bitcoin I had the same feeling
[65:46] as when micro strategy took their first
[65:50] buy and made it public put it on bitcoin
[65:53] on the balance sheet that wow did the
[65:55] the next country will now likely
[65:58] come I mean there's been some meaningful
[66:01] attempts to that I don't think anything
[66:04] as significant as El
[66:06] Salvador but um I'm actually astonished
[66:10] that there's no more Public Announcement
[66:12] of uh Sovereign Nations basically buying
[66:15] Bitcoin I hear a lot of rumors of
[66:19] basically countries in the Gulf
[66:21] potentially taking a step at Bitcoin
[66:24] that could be either
[66:26] UAE Qatar uman or Saudi um but it's not
[66:33] something that's really been publicly
[66:34] disclosed You could argue that if you're
[66:37] in the process of accumulating Bitcoin
[66:39] you don't really want to uh publicize
[66:41] that but yet I feel if a bigger nation
[66:46] actually did make it public that they
[66:49] were in the process of adopting Bitcoin
[66:52] or even just accumulating Bitcoin um
[66:56] as part of the national Reserve I think
[66:58] it would be do wonders for Price
[67:01] appreciation I think it would do wonders
[67:03] for adoption I think it will take us to
[67:07] like close to 100K like in a matter of a
[67:10] week two weeks um it needs obviously to
[67:14] be a significant Nation but uh i' I've
[67:17] been astonished that uh again that there
[67:20] has been no follow-ups on that in a in a
[67:23] significant way I'm very bullish on the
[67:26] like just looking from afar as I said
[67:29] I've not had feet on the ground in El
[67:31] Salvador but I'm extremely bullish on
[67:34] just the general statistics I can see I
[67:36] mean it went from one of the uh most
[67:40] dangerous places on planet Earth to to
[67:43] be with murder rates criminal
[67:45] rates abduction rates all these nasty
[67:49] statistics just
[67:50] being in in the very severe end of that
[67:53] to being in a very low end of that
[67:56] uh I don't think that's that's obviously
[67:58] has to do with more stricter control and
[67:59] and more imprisonments and and stuff
[68:02] like this and not so much with Bitcoin
[68:04] adoption but I think it basically tells
[68:07] a story of a country that is uh that is
[68:11] really doing a 180 in in terms of
[68:13] everything and I
[68:15] think sometimes you need to be like half
[68:18] the risk
[68:20] willingness like to to see change you
[68:22] also have to to risk something I think
[68:25] the old Chinese saying is that if you if
[68:27] you did as you did yesterday you can
[68:30] expect what happened yesterday something
[68:32] like that and I think that's very true I
[68:36] think political regimes globally are
[68:40] sometimes too afraid of risk to a CH
[68:43] afraid of changing the Status Quo in
[68:45] order to see real change or with even
[68:49] having the potential of real change uh
[68:52] politics in in modern world is is sort
[68:54] of like having a budget a financial B
[68:57] budget and then dividing that in
[68:59] different buckets we have healthc care
[69:00] here we have infrastructure here here's
[69:03] the tax rate it goes up and down and
[69:05] depending on what political party is is
[69:08] getting elected they would kind of like
[69:10] just Tinker on all of these variables in
[69:13] some way or form but it's not really
[69:14] producing real
[69:16] change I think El Salvador is a good
[69:19] example of the fact that real change can
[69:22] actually happen I think they are not yet
[69:25] that place where they are really
[69:27] harvesting the fruits uh you can argue
[69:30] that they harvested the first small
[69:32] fruits of their efforts with criminal
[69:34] rates going down and so forth
[69:37] but I I I think we need to see them win
[69:40] in a big way before uh much like as I
[69:44] said before with with micro strategy I
[69:46] mean micro strategy once they let's see
[69:49] they make 10 plus billion 15 plus
[69:52] billion on their Bitcoin bed that's when
[69:55] I think it it will it will shake eye
[69:57] eyebrows uh around the world and I think
[69:59] the same will happen for El Salvador if
[70:01] they really change their Nation yeah
[70:04] definitely Al has the advantage to be
[70:07] actually one of the stories that kind of
[70:09] started on the bottom like they had the
[70:11] highest murder rate they had not a lot
[70:13] going on for them uh and if this can be
[70:17] even though it's small country smaller
[70:18] than Austria uh it can be one of the
[70:22] Highlight stories as a role serving as a
[70:24] role model for other nations that are in
[70:26] a similar situation uh like obviously it
[70:30] will not be like America is then taking
[70:32] uh that example of El Salvador but it
[70:34] will be maybe like a small country that
[70:36] also has problems that taking the uh
[70:40] example of el salador and yeah na p is
[70:42] also like doing I think a good job uh of
[70:46] of of one signaling to the outside
[70:49] what's actually going on and also inside
[70:53] doing a good job in bettering the
[70:55] country obviously I also have not been
[70:57] there but I have spoken on the podcast
[71:00] with I think at this point six or seven
[71:03] people that actually live in El Salvador
[71:05] uh so I think I have a better and better
[71:08] grasp of what's actually going on and I
[71:10] think I'm November there's a Bitcoin
[71:12] conference there if everything is going
[71:14] as I plan I will be there and I'm I'm
[71:17] really looking forward to check out the
[71:18] country what's the what's the conference
[71:20] is it is it was it Pacific Bitcoin or is
[71:23] a Bitcoin festival or something like
[71:25] this
[71:25] I think it's called adopting Bitcoin but
[71:28] I could be wrong adopting Bitcoin that's
[71:29] probably the one I was considering as
[71:31] well so yeah if all stars a line I will
[71:33] see you in El Salvador perfect that
[71:36] would be uh really cool and I also
[71:38] consider like if I go there because it's
[71:40] a long flight for me I will probably be
[71:43] there like one two weeks because I don't
[71:46] like if you just go there and then see
[71:48] the Bitcoin conference and move back you
[71:50] probably have
[71:51] a not as real of a as as side of
[71:55] Salvador I really want to be there a
[71:57] little bit earlier or later uh and see
[71:59] out all all the places maybe rent a car
[72:01] drive around the country and see see the
[72:04] places that outside of the big cities uh
[72:06] and there is I think uh one of my
[72:09] colleagues in Germany Mark did it uh and
[72:12] he would went on his own completely
[72:15] alone there and wanted to see everything
[72:17] did not wanted too much help from other
[72:19] bitcoiners because he really wanted to
[72:20] experience the country so uh will be
[72:23] interesting to see definitely definitely
[72:25] I mean imagine what they're doing there
[72:28] I I I sometimes I I did actually some
[72:31] modeling I think some people will find
[72:32] that interesting but basically I see
[72:34] Bitcoin also a little bit of a religion
[72:37] because it's something that once you
[72:40] have spend enough time on it you kind of
[72:42] get integrated and then you start
[72:44] educating and telling other
[72:46] people about it it sort of becomes a
[72:49] little bit like a religion and it's
[72:52] growing at the same Pace also as the
[72:55] bigger religions have done in the past
[72:58] actually could argue it is a religion by
[73:01] by those met metrics and it's
[73:04] interesting to see basically what what's
[73:06] happening with the like the first
[73:09] country that basically seems to really
[73:11] manifested as maybe that would become
[73:14] Jerusalem what what Jerusalem is for
[73:16] Christianity maybe El salvad will be for
[73:19] the Bitcoin religion that would be great
[73:22] I mean uh uh our Bitcoin Maxi Max Kaiser
[73:26] and and Stacy are already there so it
[73:29] could be a good story and a lot of
[73:31] Bitcoin is actually there I think one of
[73:32] my colleagues Al linaa s from the little
[73:34] Bitcoin hardler uh he she moved around
[73:37] always in her life and now she's kind of
[73:39] settling down uh in in El Salvador so
[73:42] there's a lot of interesting Trends
[73:43] going on um we have an tin in the
[73:46] podcast where the previous guest is
[73:47] asking a question for the next guest uh
[73:50] and your question from the previous
[73:52] guest is what is the bit what is the
[73:54] best argument you heard against
[73:59] Bitcoin um the fact
[74:03] that
[74:06] transactions like number of Shear
[74:08] transactions is not increasing at the
[74:12] same Pace as price itself that it
[74:17] becomes a potential a HLA economy where
[74:21] everyone is just holding their
[74:23] coins uh block rewards will diminish
[74:27] every four years miners will be
[74:30] dependent on fees but if no one is
[74:32] basically
[74:33] transacting uh there will be also a
[74:37] smaller and smaller fee payments paid
[74:39] out to the miners which are essentially
[74:41] those securing the network yeah
[74:44] definitely this is also the the the most
[74:46] leged and this also interesting because
[74:48] when you think about Bitcoin so much and
[74:51] then you see the biggest proponents of
[74:53] Bitcoin like and Peter shiff and you
[74:54] hear talk and you're like there's no
[74:56] valid argument in there but bitcoiners
[74:59] actually have really interesting
[75:01] arguments and I love the saying that
[75:03] bitcoiners are the the best critics of
[75:06] Bitcoin
[75:08] actually um I think so Peter shiff is a
[75:11] let's get on that on record too Peter
[75:13] shiff is a horrible critic of of Bitcoin
[75:16] I used to love him for his macro
[75:19] takes uh I also adore him for his takes
[75:23] on gold and all of his
[75:25] viewpoints on the fear
[75:27] economy but man am I tired to hearing
[75:30] him beating up a dead horse with the
[75:33] same Bitcoin arguments and I cannot
[75:35] believe he's having the air time in this
[75:38] industry that he's having like why You
[75:41] featuring this gentlemen I'm not sure
[75:45] yeah I think he has a meme status at
[75:48] this point uh and the longer you are in
[75:51] Bitcoin the more you get bored and and
[75:54] that of him because you're like uh I
[75:56] don't like to hear him and I also like
[75:58] to hear him a lot in the beginning I I
[76:00] think he was the second or third third
[76:02] video that I heard about Bitcoin it was
[76:05] a debate with him I don't even remember
[76:08] with whom he debated one with him and
[76:11] Eric exactly yes yes yes yes yes uh this
[76:15] is the debate one so I I got orange B
[76:19] kind of by that uh video a lot because
[76:22] uh um it it teached me about sound
[76:26] money um because before I was a stock
[76:29] investor and then I got into like what's
[76:31] the value of gold what's the value of
[76:33] Bitcoin it has no cash flow like this
[76:35] teach me that um yeah perfect then uh
[76:39] thank you uh for for being on thank you
[76:41] for taking the time it was a real
[76:42] pleasure talking with you uh and uh
[76:45] before let you go is there anything you
[76:47] want to shout out is there any way or
[76:50] what is the best way for people to get
[76:51] in touch with you and ask your questions
[76:53] I mean my Twitter handle is a good thing
[76:56] I mainly treat about bitcoin price
[77:00] development Trends I see in the market
[77:04] some stupid joke takes sometimes and
[77:07] then generally what's happening in the
[77:09] fintech and Technology space uh was a
[77:12] pleasure participating Robin uh hope to
[77:15] see you in El
[77:17] Salvador and before I leave I should
[77:19] also post my my question to the to the
[77:22] next uh participant I suppose
[77:25] uh yes I usually do this offline but you
[77:27] can also do it online if you want ah
[77:29] okay okay I that's great I will have
[77:31] some more pling about what the what
[77:34] question I will ask them uh yeah it's
[77:36] like I I I thought about doing this
[77:39] while recording but then I was like I
[77:41] want to give the guest a little bit
[77:44] thinking time before he gives his
[77:47] question because then I thought like
[77:49] maybe the quality of question is a
[77:50] little bit
[77:51] better uh but yeah let's let's go with
[77:54] that the the world has not enough high
[77:57] quality questions there too many
[77:59] questions are shallow and if better
[78:02] questions were framed more understanding
[78:05] and better answers can be given very
[78:07] good then thank you for the time orri
[78:10] yeah please cheers
