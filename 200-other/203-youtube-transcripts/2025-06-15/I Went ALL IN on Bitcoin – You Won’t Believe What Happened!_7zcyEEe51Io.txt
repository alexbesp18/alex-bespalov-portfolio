[00:00] 95% of my income is Bitcoin I live
[00:02] primarily on bitcoin and I have since
[00:04] 2020 or rather I can accept Fiat but I'm
[00:08] I'm so far down that rabbit hole of I
[00:10] want to live on bitcoin that if somebody
[00:12] wants to pay me in Fiat I actually
[00:14] charge a premium and that premium is 15%
[00:17] it's not that I don't have a bank
[00:18] account or a credit card it's that I
[00:19] don't keep any value there we started
[00:21] something called the SAT market and so
[00:23] this is a circular market and it's not
[00:25] just like hey like here's a Bitcoin
[00:27] shirt or a hat or whatever there's some
[00:29] of that too which great it's like things
[00:31] that I need dayto day there's Farmers I
[00:33] can get beef eggs chicken have
[00:35] confidence in yourself that you can try
[00:37] things without risking much and you will
[00:41] come out of it on the other side having
[00:43] leveled up and having a greater
[00:45] understanding of the intricacies of how
[00:47] Bitcoin actually works it's not going to
[00:49] be everybody switches to bitcoin at once
[00:51] there's going to be people living in the
[00:52] future now and so there's going to be a
[00:54] class of people that are wealthier
[00:56] healthier and have all the coolest
[01:01] [Music]
[01:04] hi Ben how you doing everything fine on
[01:05] your end I'm good thanks uh glad to be
[01:09] here thanks for having me absolutely uh
[01:12] and one maybe obvious question to ask
[01:14] but uh why are you bullish for for
[01:18] 2095 honestly I mean I'm kind of bullish
[01:22] because right now I'm I'm making so many
[01:26] different tutorials and things and and
[01:27] they're all items that came to fruition
[01:31] throughout the bare market so I'm I'm
[01:34] getting to see the fruits of the labor
[01:36] of people that were working hard when
[01:39] the rest of the world didn't care and so
[01:42] all that thing all those things are
[01:43] starting to land in my lap and I'm I'm
[01:45] getting to make cool videos and and and
[01:48] see how much the tools have improved
[01:50] over the past few years oh yeah like
[01:53] this building in the bare market and
[01:54] then you can see it in in the bull
[01:56] market how it actually shapes out like
[01:58] you have been around for quite some time
[02:00] you have a very successful YouTube
[02:02] channel how long how long are you doing
[02:04] that oh I've uh this year in May it will
[02:07] be nine years that I've been doing
[02:10] tutorial
[02:11] content well all the time with with
[02:14] Bitcoin on YouTube or like other
[02:17] tutorials also uh all Bitcoin specific
[02:21] well I should say caveat when I first
[02:23] started I dabbled in other other coins
[02:28] uh but then over I mean that was early
[02:30] so you know you can't follow me too much
[02:33] but uh I gradually uh through careful
[02:37] thought um I came to the point of uh
[02:41] understanding Bitcoin only and then
[02:42] started focusing solely on bitcoin
[02:46] tutorials and content wow it's like with
[02:49] with making content so long on bitcoin
[02:53] um how different is how would you say is
[02:56] is this time right now in Bitcoin is is
[02:59] there something different around uh in
[03:02] this as we said before like now it's the
[03:04] bull market you build in the bare Market
[03:06] do you see any difference or it's like
[03:07] all the time the the same thing um it's
[03:11] it's getting a lot better and uh there
[03:14] there's so what I would say is when I
[03:17] started is there was a complete lack of
[03:21] content um you know I would I was I was
[03:25] hungry for it I was seeking it out um I
[03:28] could only find maybe one or two
[03:31] podcasts that I could even listen to
[03:33] that would talk about Bitcoin and it was
[03:35] you know once a week or something so it
[03:37] was just I was just always waiting for
[03:39] that next episode to come out and I was
[03:41] very very curious and and info was few
[03:44] and far between and in and around
[03:46] educational stuff in terms of how to
[03:48] practically use anything I spent my
[03:52] first two years just tearing my hair out
[03:54] trying to figure out this stuff on my
[03:56] own because I'm a very visual learner
[03:58] and there was no no video content on how
[04:01] do I do something oftentimes people
[04:03] would say I'd ask in a forum and they'd
[04:05] say oh yeah go to this uh this post that
[04:08] was from a couple years ago scroll
[04:11] halfway down through the comments and
[04:12] some dude left like a little bullet
[04:15] point list of how to do it like I I do
[04:18] not learn that way so um but now you
[04:22] contrast that and there's you could not
[04:26] consume all of the Bitcoin related
[04:29] content that comes out with the amount
[04:31] of time that you have in the day and
[04:34] every facet every little nook and cranny
[04:37] of information there's tons and tons of
[04:39] content and not only just content but
[04:42] content that is presented in an
[04:44] accessible way so that people can
[04:47] actually understand what they're looking
[04:49] at um and that goes for the why of
[04:52] Bitcoin but also the how of Bitcoin and
[04:54] that's kind of what I've built around
[04:56] but I'm not the only one educating
[04:58] people on the practical stuff there's
[05:00] plenty of other people that are helping
[05:02] people out and educating them in how to
[05:05] properly secure and use Bitcoin so um
[05:09] people today are it's a blessing and a
[05:11] curse because one you're you're never
[05:15] not going to be able to find an answer
[05:17] but two because there's so much content
[05:19] there's also a lot of noise and so if
[05:22] you're brand new to the
[05:24] space you until you get on the right
[05:27] vein of of quality content you can be
[05:31] very very distracted by a lot of the
[05:33] noise and a lot of the garbage out there
[05:35] so it's it's a double-edged
[05:37] sword yeah I remember in my early days
[05:39] in 2020 when I came into Bitcoin I
[05:41] listen to a lot of people that I am now
[05:44] thinking why did listen to that like
[05:46] even in the first place like why would I
[05:48] do that but they they you developed that
[05:51] over time do you also noce that people
[05:55] are falling FAS in the rabbit hole
[05:57] because the content got so much better
[05:59] yeah yeah the one of the things that
[06:01] I've noticed the
[06:03] most especially in doing one-on ones
[06:05] with people and being able to ask them
[06:07] questions about their Learning Journey
[06:10] is how expedited it is how quickly
[06:14] people have been able
[06:16] to understand self- custody be able to
[06:20] um understand Bitcoin only things that
[06:24] took me ages because there there was no
[06:28] accessibility around that stuff and then
[06:30] I I'll get on a call with somebody and
[06:32] they'll say yeah I
[06:33] started six months ago or a year ago and
[06:37] you know after X number of months I
[06:39] figured out why Bitcoin only and then
[06:41] after uh another another set of months I
[06:43] figured out this and on the call with me
[06:45] they're discussing like multisig
[06:48] Solutions and they're using like a a
[06:49] cold card and they're talking about bip
[06:52] 85 all these like complex things that
[06:54] I'm like how like you're you're a year
[06:56] into your journey and you're just a
[06:59] blowing
[07:00] away my pace of learning that I had when
[07:04] I started it took me years to get to the
[07:06] point of oh this is why Bitcoin only or
[07:09] it took me you know I I didn't start
[07:11] diving into these more complex things
[07:14] until way down the line uh so it's very
[07:17] encouraging again once people get on the
[07:19] right
[07:20] vein they get FASTT tracked in their
[07:23] learning and they can do so much in so
[07:26] little time and it's because people are
[07:28] able to stand stand on the shoulders of
[07:30] those that came before them is there
[07:32] something that that you still like
[07:36] discover new with like nine years of
[07:38] learning Bitcoin uh I mean obviously
[07:40] maybe with the scaling aspects of like
[07:43] how do we get faster payments and
[07:44] lightning and fed and all those things
[07:46] but is is there something that you're
[07:48] like oh like I discovered that the last
[07:50] two months and I was not aware of that
[07:51] before is there still some some things
[07:53] like that I think the discovery for me
[07:57] at this point comes in and around around
[08:00] the bleeding edge new stuff that's
[08:03] coming out and um in and around how some
[08:07] of these layers and complementary
[08:10] Technologies work together um you know
[08:15] I'm I'm very uh very curious in and
[08:20] around yes things like Arc and cashew
[08:24] and fimt and and how they're all going
[08:27] to play together it's also made
[08:30] me um
[08:32] Wonder or or actually just recognize
[08:35] that I don't
[08:37] know how the average person will first
[08:41] interact with Bitcoin when they come to
[08:44] Bitcoin in 5 years time I don't know
[08:47] what that entry layer is because you
[08:51] know fees are low well while we're
[08:54] chatting right now but but they they've
[08:56] been volatile so they can they can Spike
[08:59] and
[09:00] those Spikes have uh have created a bit
[09:05] of an urgency at least they did for a
[09:07] while an urgency to make sure that
[09:09] people understood how to use lightning
[09:11] or had
[09:13] optionality in the way that they use
[09:15] Bitcoin to make it easier and cheaper
[09:18] and quicker all of that um I think it's
[09:22] made me
[09:23] question how I educate people because I
[09:27] used to start from a here here's your
[09:30] onchain you know self custodial um you
[09:34] know we're going to start with your
[09:35] here's your seed phrase and you're going
[09:37] to use onchain first and then explaining
[09:40] hey after this there's something called
[09:43] lightning on top of it and that's how
[09:45] this is how it works with the base chain
[09:47] and oh now lightning is kind of like the
[09:50] glue that's also holding together all of
[09:53] these other things like fedt and cashew
[09:55] and such and such um I think what I'm
[09:59] coming to realize and the a discovery
[10:02] for me is
[10:04] that we are we've been used to teaching
[10:07] in a way where you have from the first
[10:10] interaction with Bitcoin maximum self-
[10:13] sovereignty and then you move up the
[10:16] chain for greater um we we'll call it
[10:20] Greater usability and uh additional
[10:23] features you you move upwards towards
[10:26] that whereas I think that we're going to
[10:29] be the teaching from a perspective of
[10:31] what's the lowest hanging fruit first
[10:34] and then people will work their way down
[10:36] the sovereignty stack to get as close to
[10:38] that Bas layer as possible so I think I
[10:40] think that's kind of been the discovery
[10:42] for me and experimenting with these
[10:45] brand new things that you know you don't
[10:48] know that they're possible until they
[10:50] become possible and somebody builds
[10:53] them yeah there's so many questions for
[10:55] me uh around how people will actually
[10:58] use and interact with with Bitcoin in
[11:01] the in the future we we know like the
[11:03] base layer obviously uh will be very
[11:06] expensive to transactive there will only
[11:08] be a limited amount of of people and
[11:10] institutions on top of it so we need
[11:12] kind of a lay on top but also like how
[11:16] will self- custody work in the future
[11:19] how how how will people do self- custody
[11:21] on lightning on like maybe even on top
[11:23] of something like there are a lot of
[11:25] questions mark for me that's where I
[11:27] usually also go with uh uh to to ask
[11:30] those questions because it's just like
[11:31] really um unimaginable for me um when
[11:35] you look now at lightning it seems to be
[11:38] the the main technology where we first
[11:41] scale up with with with Bitcoin do you
[11:44] think that that's that will be the
[11:45] winner or like uh do do you see see a
[11:48] chance that we completely do something
[11:50] else with with scaling Bitcoin so what
[11:52] I'm seeing right now with approaches to
[11:56] how we interact with Bitcoin and in
[11:59] around lightning
[12:01] um as I kind of alluded to it seems to
[12:06] me that lightning will be the glue that
[12:11] holds together a whole bunch of
[12:14] different ways to interact with Bitcoin
[12:17] and yes some in some instances that will
[12:19] be somebody that has their own self-
[12:21] Sovereign lightning Channel and you know
[12:25] has that key that interacts with the
[12:27] other key in the multisig that creates
[12:29] the lightning Channel there will be that
[12:32] of course but I think what we're more
[12:36] likely to see is that there's going to
[12:39] be lots of different options for how you
[12:42] use Bitcoin and that the wallet that
[12:45] you're using unless you're a power user
[12:47] will just kind of into it what is the
[12:51] best layer and tool for you based on
[12:55] your actions and your designated
[12:57] preferences so you might download a
[12:59] wallet and they'll say hey what are you
[13:02] are you going to be using this primarily
[13:03] for savings for day-to-day spendings a
[13:06] mix of both um how how are you going to
[13:09] be interacting with this wallet and
[13:11] based on the very easy kind of layman
[13:15] responses that you give it will say oh
[13:18] it sounds like you're going to be doing
[13:20] small
[13:22] transactions um that are tiny little
[13:25] tips on on Noster or some sort of social
[13:28] platform um so we think we're just going
[13:30] to kind of plunk you into a cashew mint
[13:33] that makes sense because you're not
[13:34] going to have large amounts but then if
[13:37] your mannerisms and your interactions
[13:40] change they may bump you to something
[13:42] like liquid or a self- sovereign self-
[13:46] custodial lightning Channel or onchain
[13:49] or some of the other layers that are not
[13:52] as ubiquitous yet um I I think that it
[13:55] will be very dependent on the person
[13:57] unless you very much specify no I want
[14:00] to be here because self- sovereignty is
[14:03] priority or I want to be here because I
[14:05] need small transactions and I need to
[14:08] not be worrying about liquidity and
[14:10] channels and stuff like that so um the I
[14:14] know that's a bit of a long rambly
[14:16] answer but uh I think that lightning is
[14:20] going to make all of those things
[14:21] interact because that's what I'm seeing
[14:24] from wallets is somebody might be
[14:26] sitting in a cashew mint or aiment or on
[14:31] liquid or on Arc or whatever and I'm
[14:35] able to transact amongst all of those
[14:40] people
[14:41] seamlessly because lightning is
[14:43] stringing all those systems together so
[14:46] that's exciting to me H how sov do you
[14:50] think that that that future will be I've
[14:53] I had one interesting uh thing that I
[14:56] guest brought up to me uh he said in the
[14:58] early
[14:59] he was an older fol around like 75 years
[15:02] old and he said like in the early days
[15:03] of the internet uh uh people thought you
[15:07] everyone will run their own email
[15:09] servers uh now obviously we know like
[15:12] it's it's most like Google and some some
[15:14] other ones um is that now we like real
[15:18] we're really pressing like self- custody
[15:19] run your own node and all those those
[15:22] those mentors um is that the future also
[15:25] where we going or is is most people like
[15:28] 199 5% of of of the people will just
[15:31] like have an app and they don't even
[15:33] know that Bitcoin is in the backbone of
[15:34] that and it's just a protocol that works
[15:36] and they they still have like the app
[15:39] interface that could shut them down and
[15:41] stuff like
[15:42] that um I mean realistically most people
[15:47] just want the easiest thing uh and they
[15:49] don't recognize the value of self-
[15:52] sovereignty until they no longer have
[15:53] any and so I I what I think is
[15:58] realistically going to play out is um
[16:01] when it comes to bitcoin we do have a a
[16:05] really hardcore base of people that are
[16:08] are pushing for that and I think that
[16:11] those tools will continue to be built
[16:13] out and and also hopefully built out in
[16:17] a way where they are accessible
[16:21] to uh maybe not even the average person
[16:24] but the person that is willing to just
[16:26] do a little bit of extra work to be able
[16:29] to utilize them I think the average
[16:32] person 10 years from now 15 years from
[16:35] now humans are going to human and they
[16:39] will default to the simplest thing at
[16:42] their fingertips with the most bells and
[16:43] whistles that they like but my genuine
[16:48] hope is that regardless of that default
[16:52] setting for most people's brains that
[16:55] the the the core ethos of Bitcoin
[16:59] remains an underpinning of everything so
[17:02] that if there is some sort of uh grab at
[17:08] people's sovereignty that they'll be
[17:10] able to easily move down those layers
[17:13] and yeah they might get a a little bit
[17:15] hurt in the process but they'll be able
[17:17] to default back to something that is
[17:20] more or less Unstoppable or very very
[17:23] difficult to clamp down upon so you know
[17:25] myself as an individual user I'll be the
[17:28] person that is running all the
[17:30] infrastructure and that I you know other
[17:32] than the tiny little bits I don't mind
[17:35] if I'm if I'm sending like a a Noster
[17:38] zap using something custodial I'm not
[17:41] actually doing that right now it is my
[17:43] own lightning node but I wouldn't be
[17:45] upset if that was the case and I've have
[17:47] done that in the past but um yeah I
[17:51] think you're going to have different
[17:52] classes of people uh some people will be
[17:55] running their own nodes and their own
[17:56] lightning nodes and all of that and
[17:58] other people will just use the custodial
[18:01] thing that can tell them yes or no and
[18:04] then my hope is that they'll they will
[18:06] be able to default to the other thing
[18:09] when they are told
[18:10] no yeah that's it's a practical approach
[18:14] like uh I for example uh when when I buy
[18:17] a burger in Vienna with with Bitcoin or
[18:19] something like that we have a restaurant
[18:20] here that that allows that uh I have a
[18:23] small wallet of Satoshi uh um amount
[18:26] always there to just spend it like
[18:28] there's a maximum of like 100 euros on
[18:31] there um if spet of Satoshi now rocks me
[18:35] of this 100 EUR I I will make fun of
[18:37] them on Twitter but I'm I'm not losing
[18:39] my life savings here so I I don't really
[18:42] care like I like the app it's really
[18:43] easy to uh use and and does not make any
[18:46] mistakes and I don't have to care for
[18:48] anything uh for a small amount is it
[18:50] okay but I would never put like all my
[18:52] Bitcoin on there that would be like
[18:56] extremely stupid of me so I like the
[19:00] like the approach of do do the right
[19:03] thing for the like don't shoot the bird
[19:05] with
[19:06] like huge catapult or something like
[19:09] that it does make sense like that yeah I
[19:13] think um I I like the approach of
[19:17] something like fedt where it's
[19:20] compartmentalizing the risk so with fedt
[19:23] for if somebody's watching that is
[19:26] unfamiliar effectively this would be
[19:28] like a multisig that's holding money for
[19:31] a community um small community of people
[19:34] that are familiar with each other and uh
[19:38] you can transact with people within the
[19:41] mint
[19:43] instantly basically perfectly privately
[19:46] no fees or anything like that and it's
[19:48] it's ecash and it's it's represented one
[19:52] to one with the SATs that underly it um
[19:56] and so there's a lot of benefits there
[19:57] but you can also string it together with
[19:59] lightning so if you're in a mint and
[20:01] somebody else is in a different fed aint
[20:04] then you can have lightning gateways
[20:06] that allow transactions between the two
[20:09] mints and you gain the privacy of the
[20:12] group so there's no indication of which
[20:15] person in One mint sent out and there's
[20:18] no indication which person in the other
[20:19] mint received so you're you're also
[20:22] getting huge privacy guarantees there um
[20:26] and the thing with that is is there
[20:27] trust involved absolutely there's going
[20:29] to be the Guardians of the of each
[20:33] particular mint and some will have many
[20:35] and others will have just a few but if
[20:39] something goes wrong then it is it is
[20:42] segregated to an individual mint much
[20:45] like when we had kind of free Banking
[20:47] and it wasn't all topped down um I if if
[20:52] a a bank was messing around then you'd
[20:55] have a bank run at that particular
[20:57] institution but you could also mtig that
[20:59] risk by being at many different banks
[21:02] and so I think that is going to be
[21:04] something that's going to be a huge
[21:06] positive in terms of the Privacy
[21:08] guarantees that it gives there's a
[21:11] tradeoff with trust there but there's
[21:13] also a a an ability to mitigate Risk by
[21:17] spreading out funds across multiple
[21:19] mints and that's
[21:21] one one solution that's out there
[21:24] there's going to be many more but I you
[21:26] know I I would be okay with having
[21:28] spending amounts or medium saving
[21:30] amounts spread across a a setup like
[21:34] that um and then down the line who knows
[21:38] what other Solutions there there could
[21:39] be I partnered up with coin vigilante
[21:43] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[21:46] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[21:49] look at that beauty I love it so much
[21:52] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[21:55] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[21:58] way to go out there and show that you
[22:00] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[22:04] Bitcoin only and coin Vigilant just
[22:07] dropped a completely new and amazing

[22:20] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[22:24] level of detail they put in in this
[22:26] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[22:29] those amazing coin viland time pieces
[22:32] down in the descriptions I love those
[22:34] watches so so much if you watch or
[22:38] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[22:40] I'll guess you already bought some
[22:42] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[22:45] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[22:48] in a hardware wallet my personal
[22:50] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[22:52] the bit box it's super secure it's
[22:54] simple to set up it's also perfect gift

[23:12] to really level up your sovereignty as
[23:14] an individual you have to have the most
[23:17] secure self custody setup you have to
[23:19] secure your own devices you have to
[23:22] protect your privacy you have to set up
[23:25] an inheritance plan and depending on
[23:27] where you live you even want to have a
[23:30] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[23:33] in case something goes really really
[23:34] wrong and through all those steps the

[23:46] minute free call to find out how you can
[23:49] level up your sovereignty interesting
[23:52] yeah um maybe coming back to to a little
[23:56] bit more like what what's going on today
[23:58] today um I think most viewers that
[24:01] listen now have uh either self custody
[24:05] Bitcoin uh on chain or should have the
[24:09] the Bitcoin on chain on self custody uh
[24:12] I'm actually as stunned by sometimes do
[24:15] those YouTube polls of like oh like do
[24:18] you do self custody or not and then like
[24:19] oh like 40% don't and it's like I in
[24:23] every video I advertise self- custody I
[24:26] I always do like the self- custody thing
[24:28] uh but a lot of people still still don't
[24:31] do it um but similar when I ask like oh
[24:34] do you also have altcoins for some
[24:36] reason altcoin I also like to watch my
[24:39] channel even though I only talk about
[24:40] Bitcoin um but how do you approach self
[24:44] custody now maybe now the as you said in
[24:47] the beginning it was like one way one in
[24:50] tutorial now we kind of have the problem
[24:51] of like there are so many products and
[24:53] services out there and so many different
[24:55] opinions even on Zelf custody uh how do
[24:58] you approach that when someone comes to
[25:00] like oh like how do what should I do in
[25:02] myself C this setup I usually am like
[25:07] I'm fearful of you answering that
[25:08] because then it's like a lot of
[25:11] responsibility yeah I mean it's there's
[25:14] going to be slightly different
[25:16] approaches depend depending on the type
[25:19] of person that's that's coming to me um
[25:22] and it starts with a number of questions
[25:25] that I have for them you know like you
[25:28] know what is your experience with you
[25:30] know how do you know how to operate a
[25:33] computer do you know how to operate a
[25:34] smartphone things like that um if that
[25:38] part is lacking then it's going to be a
[25:40] little bit different and there's going
[25:42] to be some catching up to do and and
[25:44] really kind of being careful and you
[25:47] know hedging against mistakes and all
[25:49] that kind of stuff like basically
[25:52] tiptoeing towards more self- sovereignty
[25:55] but maybe uh something where the person
[25:59] has the ability to have some fault
[26:01] tolerance they can screw up a bunch and
[26:03] still be okay whereas if somebody is uh
[26:06] pretty well versed and and they uh you
[26:09] know they're they're pretty proficient
[26:11] technologically like if you can operate
[26:14] a basic smartphone and you have a laptop
[26:18] and you know how to like download
[26:19] programs things like that then then
[26:21] you're probably going to be good enough
[26:23] to uh have some self- sovereignty and do
[26:26] your self- custody without too much
[26:28] worry um as long as you understand what
[26:32] you're actually doing and you know a few
[26:35] uh dos and do Nots
[26:37] so um with the average person that I've
[26:43] been dealing with with the one-on ones
[26:45] and through uh my company Bitcoin Mentor
[26:49] the people that we have coming in the
[26:50] door are are curious they're very
[26:55] Freedom oriented they they understand
[26:58] understand self- sovereignty and they
[27:00] know that they they're coming to us
[27:02] because they don't want to leave trust
[27:04] in somebody else they want to be their
[27:06] own person they want to take control of
[27:08] their own wealth and so usually if the
[27:14] person already has a preference for
[27:17] Hardware um there's for the most part
[27:21] there's a lot of things that will just
[27:23] say okay well if this is your personal
[27:25] preference and you already have that
[27:26] device then let's stick with it and
[27:28] we'll just make sure that you're you're
[27:30] solid and your knowledge of it um there
[27:33] are a couple exceptions to that where if
[27:36] somebody's using a certain device we may
[27:38] try to you know Steer them of gradually
[27:42] moving away um if somebody just doesn't
[27:45] know then I actually I'm I'm a huge cold
[27:49] card fan I love what coin kite does um
[27:51] so I do chat about them quite a bit um I
[27:55] you know I I love the cold card I also
[27:57] like the tap signer for kind of like an
[28:00] easy hey like something basic you have a
[28:03] pin and you have a card that you tap to
[28:04] your phone that's something that people
[28:06] can usually handle um and and yeah so I
[28:10] I I try
[28:11] to really ask questions of and listen to
[28:15] the person first and then lead them down
[28:17] that path the biggest thing is not to
[28:19] throw everything in the kitchen sink at
[28:21] them on day one it's baby steps based on
[28:25] their skills and uh yeah so it's it's a
[28:28] hard question to answer but my goal is
[28:31] to get people to have as much self-
[28:33] sovereignty as possible and if they are
[28:37] holding an amount that to them they're
[28:40] they're quite worried about and it's
[28:42] ballooned and and then I might lean
[28:45] towards something like a an assisted
[28:47] multisig solution as well because that
[28:50] gives them some fault
[28:51] tolerance assisted multi um uh
[28:54] collaborative multi you me know like
[28:57] yeah yeah so like
[28:58] an entity would hold a key and then you
[29:01] would hold the rest of the keys and so
[29:03] if you start losing a whole bunch of
[29:04] stuff you have that fall back of they
[29:06] can't rug pull you but they can help you
[29:08] sign a
[29:09] transaction yeah super interesting for
[29:11] me is also that I discovered just in the
[29:14] last six months actually um uh those
[29:17] time locks where a key gets activated
[29:19] after some time which um makes multi
[29:22] signature even even better for for me
[29:24] when you have like an a key that gets
[29:26] activated if don't move it it's kind of
[29:29] a really cool uh fault tolerance like a
[29:32] really cool safe uh for if if something
[29:35] goes wrong yeah this uh all the stuff
[29:38] that's happening in around multisig with
[29:40] miniscript is is staggering like the the
[29:43] possibilities there you can you can
[29:46] pretty much hedge yourself against most
[29:49] possibilities now and as you said you
[29:52] can have you can have a a multisig again
[29:56] just keeping in mind if anybody's
[29:59] listening they're like what the hell is
[30:00] a multi- think of a digital Vault a
[30:03] regular Bitcoin wallet you would have a
[30:05] digital Vault with a key which is your
[30:08] Hardware wallet or your software wallet
[30:10] that unlocks The Vault so you can move
[30:11] the funds a multisig vault or a multisig
[30:15] wallet would be a digital Vault that has
[30:17] multiple key holes and you need a
[30:20] certain number of keys in order to open
[30:22] it and move funds so more than a single
[30:24] key or more than a single device um the
[30:27] crazy easy thing about this is you can
[30:29] get so granular with it you could say
[30:32] I've got three keys that can unlock this
[30:37] Vault I require at least two of them to
[30:40] unlock it but after a certain threshold
[30:44] of time maybe there's an extra key that
[30:46] comes into play or the reverse where
[30:49] it's after a certain period of time I
[30:51] actually only require one of those keys
[30:54] to open it so that if I lose two of the
[30:56] three I still have access for a window
[30:58] of time and so you can start doing all
[31:01] these things or maybe there's a company
[31:04] that has three keys and you have three
[31:06] keys and it requires each of you to use
[31:08] two of your keys simultaneous to to
[31:11] unlock and you can have all these things
[31:13] where if this happens then this is
[31:15] available to you or if this happens then
[31:17] this is no longer available to you so
[31:20] there's just you have so many options
[31:23] here and it can be overwhelming because
[31:25] right now it's kind of a blank slate but
[31:28] I think what we'll see is we'll see kind
[31:30] of these these templates that are battle
[31:33] tested and work well for people overe
[31:35] extended periods of time and those will
[31:38] become kind of the default for a lot of
[31:41] people to use and then those that want
[31:43] to get a little bit more specific can
[31:45] add in certain functions is multisig uh
[31:49] a must now is is that something that you
[31:51] like without that you wouldn't do it uh
[31:54] it's a tough one I mean really what
[31:57] you're head in with a
[31:59] multi- is you're you're trying to
[32:02] eliminate single points of failure so if
[32:04] somebody stumbles across your seed
[32:06] phrase or something like that um if they
[32:09] get a hold of that then then you're
[32:11] hooped right um You can mitigate that
[32:13] with passphrases um and hidden wallets
[32:16] things like that but um with
[32:19] multisig
[32:21] you because you have multiple keys and
[32:23] you geographically disperse them really
[32:26] you're you're you're protecting against
[32:29] physical access because the person would
[32:32] have to go to multiple spots to to get a
[32:35] hold of that and so is it a
[32:38] must I'm not going to say it's a must
[32:41] because you can protect
[32:44] yourself um if somebody stumbles across
[32:47] your seed phrase if you got a pass
[32:48] phrase that they don't know about then
[32:51] uh you know you've got a window of time
[32:53] to to be able to protect yourself um but
[32:56] for people that maybe are a little bit
[32:58] more public or that a lot of people know
[33:01] that they own Bitcoin or something like
[33:03] that or as bit Bitcoin becomes more
[33:07] ubiquitous and a lot of people are self-
[33:10] cussing and it becomes a regular method
[33:13] of attack then then yeah maybe multisig
[33:16] becomes necessary for the average person
[33:18] I'd say multisig if you're at all public
[33:21] about your Bitcoin Holdings it and you
[33:23] have a decent amount then it's probably
[33:26] a good call to be using some type of
[33:29] multi- which also brings us to the one
[33:32] interesting topic of of of privacy I
[33:35] mean we we both are with with with name
[33:38] and face out there and and known that
[33:41] that we probably have
[33:43] Bitcoin uh is is I lost all mine in a
[33:45] bilding accident so okay sorry to
[33:49] assume uh but uh do you do you feel that
[33:54] uh that that that we have to care more
[33:57] about privacy and with we not the both
[34:00] of us but like the Bitcoins in in
[34:02] general like the that that we have to be
[34:05] careful with with uh who who are we
[34:08] saying that we have Bitcoin yeah I think
[34:12] that privacy is an
[34:14] interesting an interesting one again as
[34:17] as you alluded to you and I and anybody
[34:20] that's kind of in this Bitcoin world
[34:23] that is you know doing podcasts or
[34:25] speaking or whatever um you know you're
[34:29] we're already public and that's a
[34:32] difficult thing to Grapple with but you
[34:34] know we're at a stage right now where
[34:37] anybody that's currently in Bitcoin
[34:39] should be taking some degree of privacy
[34:43] measure in particular
[34:46] around personal data especially if
[34:48] you're buying like Hardware things like
[34:52] that and you're shipping it to a
[34:53] location might be a good idea to use a
[34:55] po. box rather than a physical address
[34:58] uh might be a good idea well first of
[35:00] all you should be taking self- custody
[35:02] but if you for whatever reason have any
[35:06] funds anywhere that is not your own
[35:09] self- custody um you need to have things
[35:11] like two- Factor authentication on on
[35:14] those accounts so that if somebody were
[35:15] to try and compromise there's a a a wall
[35:18] in front of them um yeah I mean you you
[35:22] do have to be conscious
[35:24] also it can be tricky like you if if
[35:27] you're going
[35:28] to events like Bitcoin related events
[35:31] you got to be cognizant of who you're
[35:34] around and and all that kind of stuff
[35:36] you got to be careful with your devices
[35:39] you don't want to be just connecting to
[35:40] random Wi-Fi networks at at conferences
[35:43] and places where uh people might try to
[35:46] get into your device and and steal
[35:48] information there but yeah it is it is
[35:51] very much a tricky one and then the last
[35:53] piece of the puzzle is if you're a
[35:55] person that uh doesn't even want it
[35:59] doesn't want anybody to know that you
[36:00] have Bitcoin at any point then there's a
[36:04] whole bunch of considerations that you
[36:05] have to like where are you getting your
[36:07] Bitcoin in the first place because if
[36:09] it's not a peer-to-peer uh you know if
[36:12] you're not doing it peer-to-peer via
[36:14] some sort of like um exchange that
[36:17] doesn't require
[36:18] kyc then you've already leaked some
[36:21] information there um what's your onchain
[36:23] privacy are you do using coin join and
[36:26] things like that
[36:28] and and then I mean how are you securing
[36:30] it it it's you're walking a tight rope
[36:33] between not letting anybody you don't
[36:36] want to know you have Bitcoin but also
[36:39] making sure that the people that are
[36:41] important to you your Bitcoin can get to
[36:43] them if something happens to you so it's
[36:46] it's again this double-edged sword so
[36:49] the the long and the short of it
[36:51] is how much privacy you try to attain is
[36:55] going to really depend on your goals but
[36:57] at the very least you should just be
[36:58] cautious when you're buying things and
[37:01] um shipping things to your house stuff
[37:03] like that cautious with your phone
[37:05] number and online
[37:07] accounts did you back then made a
[37:09] conscious decision about uh going pig or
[37:12] was it uh where you realized later I
[37:15] should have thought about it yeah yeah
[37:17] it was very much that it was um you know
[37:20] when I started the channel nobody cared
[37:22] nor did I think anybody would care it
[37:25] was kind of it was this niche thing that
[37:28] I was very interested
[37:29] in um I I thought well I hope somebody
[37:34] cares about these videos and maybe a few
[37:37] people find them useful I remember being
[37:39] very excited my first you know hundred
[37:44] views my first 100 subscribers and I was
[37:47] like holy wow people are people care and
[37:50] that to me was staggering and now it's
[37:52] like oh wow this uh Bitcoin has has
[37:56] changed
[37:58] Life as we know it um and is still on
[38:03] this crazy upward trajectory of
[38:05] impacting the world in ways that we
[38:06] can't even anticipate and so uh yeah no
[38:09] I did not really give too much mind to
[38:13] that early
[38:14] on and over the years it's been like
[38:18] would have would I have done things
[38:20] differently yeah maybe um would I have
[38:24] been I don't know that I would have had
[38:26] the skills at the time time to to be
[38:29] private uh I would have really had to
[38:32] figure that out over time but um I also
[38:34] don't think that what I'm doing now
[38:37] would have done as well because there's
[38:40] that Rapport there's there's like a you
[38:44] almost kind of create like a quasi
[38:46] relationship with the people that are
[38:47] are viewing like they feel like oh I
[38:49] know this face I'm comfortable I know
[38:52] this voice um I followed along with you
[38:55] know a journey
[38:57] um over time and so yeah I don't know I
[39:01] don't I I I kind of feel like I I still
[39:04] would have been somewhat public at some
[39:07] point in time and
[39:10] uh yeah we we'll see how that pans out
[39:13] for me I
[39:14] guess yeah it's it's h i I had someone
[39:19] that watches all almost all of my
[39:21] podcast and we had a quick video call
[39:24] and it was so fun because I was I was
[39:27] scared and and at the same time kind of
[39:30] uh humbled and and and kind of uh
[39:33] feeling surprised where like the amount
[39:36] he knows about me because he just
[39:38] listens to the podcast and and the Small
[39:40] Things Are Shar and like they they stick
[39:42] in in a brain and you're like because
[39:44] I've done now over 400 my 400 first
[39:47] podcast
[39:49] actually and over done over 400 podcast
[39:52] so like this is like 500 hours or
[39:55] something like that of of of content a
[39:57] few out there in the Internet it's a lot
[39:59] if if someone actually is watching this
[40:01] all the time they they they they really
[40:03] know you to a certain extent and better
[40:06] than maybe some friends yeah yeah it is
[40:09] it is really strange like it's
[40:14] um it's it's hard to kind of internalize
[40:18] that too I I think my first moment of
[40:22] being really taken
[40:23] [Music]
[40:24] aback uh at at how how much um how
[40:31] important this kind of stuff can be it
[40:35] was um it was actually uh in Miami in
[40:39] Bitcoin 2021 you know there was no
[40:42] events obviously the year prior uh
[40:44] because everything was shut down but it
[40:46] was the first really big event that I
[40:49] had been to and I got there and I had
[40:55] just probably a couple months prior two
[40:57] three months prior made a video on how
[40:59] to make a how to run your Bitcoin node
[41:02] and I think it was one of the first
[41:03] videos that somebody had really done
[41:05] like a walkthrough of it and the number
[41:09] of people that walked up and and said
[41:13] hey i' now I'm running a Bitcoin node
[41:15] because I watched that video or you know
[41:18] whatever I'm using Hardware I got my
[41:20] cold card setup or something like that
[41:22] but like that was because that was the
[41:24] thing at the time that I had recently
[41:26] done
[41:27] I'm thinking and I must have had like 10
[41:31] or 20 people come up and say hey I'm
[41:33] running a Bitcoin note now and I'm like
[41:36] this is one spot where the some
[41:40] bitcoiners have come to get together but
[41:42] like the the number of people
[41:44] specifically saying I ran a
[41:46] node there and then I'm looking at the
[41:49] numbers on the video and I'm like oh
[41:51] there's you know tens of thousands of
[41:53] views on this video like how many of
[41:56] those resulted in in somebody and now
[41:58] it's like hundreds of thousand of views
[42:00] on some of those I'm like how how many
[42:03] thousands of people are now like running
[42:05] a Bitcoin node because of of a video
[42:08] that's put out so it's like it it turns
[42:11] the number on the screen into a reality
[42:15] and you see The Passion of the people
[42:18] that uh have come to bitcoin and are
[42:21] hungry to learn whether it be like the
[42:23] the pH philosophical reasons behind
[42:26] Bitcoin or the Practical like how do I
[42:28] actually do something um it is it is uh
[42:32] pretty wild to see and and people that
[42:34] have been along the journey the whole
[42:36] time like every once in a while run into
[42:37] somebody and they'll be like I remember
[42:39] when you used to they used to walk with
[42:40] a selfie stick at the beginning of every
[42:42] video and I'd say where I was because I
[42:44] was traveling a lot um and so I'm I'm
[42:48] thinking oh geez you've been watching
[42:49] the show for eight years that's crazy uh
[42:53] yeah so so it's it's really really cool
[42:56] um
[42:57] and yeah I don't I
[42:58] don't I would have a heard I I feel like
[43:01] I would I would almost miss that because
[43:03] it's like a connection it's like oh you
[43:05] you've been along the journey with me
[43:07] yeah you and and with your decision um
[43:11] going public even though you were not
[43:14] aware of that conscious decision n nine
[43:16] years ago you you made a huge impact for
[43:20] for the community with the tutorials you
[43:23] you probably converted more people than
[43:26] than
[43:27] uh Mo most other ones to like self
[43:30] custody to running their own Noe and and
[43:31] all those things like you you're a
[43:33] digital Soldier for the orange wave you
[43:36] kind of on the Forefront of of the the
[43:38] Bitcoin Revolution it's it's a it's a
[43:40] digital war that is kind of fought in a
[43:42] different way you're going a higher risk
[43:43] but you're also uh making a huge impact
[43:46] for for the people behind you yeah yeah
[43:49] it's um I think that's very kind of you
[43:52] to say um I I
[43:55] think again it's it's encouraging to see
[43:58] so many people that are curious and want
[44:00] to level up like without without people
[44:02] genuinely caring about self- sovereignty
[44:05] um the channel doesn't exist in the
[44:07] first place so I think I think that kind
[44:10] of speaks more to the quality of people
[44:12] in Bitcoin versus you know like the the
[44:16] accomplishment of the channel it's just
[44:17] like there's there's a need for it and I
[44:19] think people are recognizing that too so
[44:21] that's why I'm always so bullish when I
[44:23] see uh other Educators coming out of the
[44:25] woodwork and putting out quality
[44:27] tutorials and how-to is um I think it's
[44:30] so important like
[44:32] it's you know you you got to pair you
[44:35] know what you do with your interviews
[44:38] and what other people do with the
[44:41] helping people understand the why of
[44:43] Bitcoin is so important and that's
[44:47] definitely I I don't think that's my
[44:49] thing like yeah I can explain why
[44:51] Bitcoin is important to people um maybe
[44:54] not as eloquently as some but I I
[44:57] definitely recognized that my role and
[45:00] other Educators roles are to come in
[45:03] step two right like somebody gets in the
[45:05] door they're like wow Bitcoin is a huge
[45:08] deal this is very
[45:10] important but now what do I do how do I
[45:13] actually use it and so like that's
[45:15] that's where I have found kind of my
[45:18] Niche and um and yeah it's an important
[45:21] one to fill but uh you've also got some
[45:23] big shoes to fill too like your your
[45:26] your in in the realm of what I would say
[45:29] is the harder job which is convincing
[45:32] people that Bitcoin matters in the first
[45:34] place yeah but it's it's a it's a it's a
[45:37] funny one I I try I mean I I I
[45:41] I I feel like sometimes I'm speaking too
[45:44] much uh even though people like really
[45:46] like that I not speaking that much and
[45:47] trying to listen more uh but as the
[45:50] podcast came along more I actually saw
[45:52] that I I speak more but I I really just
[45:54] want to listen and mind knowledge of
[45:57] Bitcoin and the why of Bitcoin because I
[45:59] wasn't good in that one year ago I still
[46:01] not really good in that in in my view
[46:04] but having 400 different people on
[46:08] explaining you why Bitcoin some some
[46:10] actually some things actually stick in
[46:12] your brain and then a family member
[46:15] asked you like why Bitcoin and then
[46:16] after 10 minutes you're still speaking
[46:18] and you're like oh like I have some
[46:19] information in my head that I didn't add
[46:21] one year ago yeah osmosis is a funny
[46:24] thing you you uh stand around with
[46:27] people that know a lot more than you for
[46:29] long enough and suddenly you've retained
[46:31] that knowledge too it's I I think it's a
[46:34] valuable thing to on a quasi regular
[46:38] basis feel like the dumbest person in
[46:40] the room because that's what helps you
[46:41] level up if you feel like you're the
[46:43] smartest person in the room too often
[46:45] that's not a good thing like you're not
[46:48] growing you you need to uh you need to
[46:50] shove yourself in spaces where you're
[46:52] maybe not super comfortable absolutely
[46:55] it was one of the reasons why I wanted
[46:57] to do do it more and more I had Jeff Bo
[46:59] I like Jeff Bo is such a great one
[47:02] because he comes on podcast like mine
[47:04] that exists for two months had 400
[47:05] subscribers and he just comes on and
[47:07] like hey let's do it uh and and gives me
[47:10] his time and his presence and his
[47:12] marketing and all those those things H
[47:14] and I was like like that was like he's
[47:16] the coolest guy I've ever spoken to uh
[47:19] and I want to have this more and then
[47:21] like half a year later I spoke to S and
[47:23] then so many more and I was like oh like
[47:25] it's really really cool
[47:27] uh and and you definitely get something
[47:29] from that but uh coming to the to the to
[47:32] the how uh and especially as you said
[47:35] Sovereign maybe before a why question
[47:37] because I like to ask why questions why
[47:39] do be fully self Sovereign like like
[47:42] what is the Intrigue for for Bitcoin is
[47:45] to be fully self- Sovereign uh and maybe
[47:48] then a little bit on how to achieve that
[47:52] yeah um so I mean
[47:55] the What drew me to Bitcoin in the first
[47:58] place was the idea of having a
[48:02] censorship
[48:03] resistant sound money um I those are two
[48:08] you know those two facets of Bitcoin
[48:10] were really compelling to me
[48:14] and
[48:16] um you have to then step back and say
[48:20] well how do I know that I'm getting
[48:23] those things like what's where's my
[48:25] guarantee
[48:27] and so this is this is also what helped
[48:29] me hone in on on bitcoin only like what
[48:32] what makes it so that the the money that
[48:34] I'm using and saving will continue to
[48:37] acur purchas purchasing power and that
[48:40] so that nobody can steal my money away
[48:42] from me and so that nobody can reverse
[48:44] my transactions or censor them and all
[48:46] all of these qualities that I want out
[48:49] of money you know who who says that
[48:52] that's how it's going to work how do I
[48:53] know and so how you know
[48:57] comes from being self- Sovereign from
[48:59] holding your own keys from the ethos of
[49:01] don't trust verify from using tools that
[49:04] are open source and allow you to uh you
[49:07] know verify that you actually are
[49:10] holding your wealth and that you're um
[49:13] you know following the rule set that uh
[49:16] you view as Bitcoin and all of these
[49:19] different things there's there's all of
[49:21] these qualities here that Bitcoin
[49:23] has but you don't truly get those
[49:28] benefits in a in a truly censorship
[49:30] resistant way unless you're self-
[49:33] Sovereign so I I guess being self-
[49:35] Sovereign as a bitcoiner all but
[49:38] guarantees you that you get those
[49:40] qualities of Bitcoin and you get them
[49:43] all to yourself interesting yeah and the
[49:47] the how has so many different questions
[49:48] and so many different Avenues on of of
[49:50] how to how to go about it from like
[49:53] should you buy non KC Bitcoin if you
[49:55] want to be fully private
[49:57] how far you taking with the self custody
[50:00] like you don't want anyone else to have
[50:02] control but you also want to give it to
[50:04] your kids maybe one day or something
[50:05] like that um how do you how do you
[50:08] navigate uh to to have the the most
[50:11] amount of of
[50:12] sovereignty while still being a
[50:15] functional member of society yeah yeah
[50:18] so this is uh is a tricky question and
[50:23] um again the answer for me is going to
[50:25] be maybe different
[50:27] for other people and so usually the way
[50:31] I like to frame it is I like to ask an
[50:35] individual um what facets of Bitcoin are
[50:38] most important to them like why are you
[50:41] here in the first place uh and also what
[50:44] are you most worried about what are the
[50:46] risks that you that make you can make
[50:50] you not be able to sleep at night um
[50:52] where do you see the the greatest Gap in
[50:56] security that you're worried about and
[50:57] so that again that might be I'm worried
[51:00] that the government is going to Outlaw
[51:02] Bitcoin and then come for my Bitcoin
[51:05] that might be a worry in somebody's head
[51:07] or I'm worried that somebody's going to
[51:09] know I have Bitcoin and they're going to
[51:10] kick open my door and threaten me and
[51:12] try and take it or I'm worried that I'm
[51:15] going to screw up and lose my own
[51:17] Bitcoin or that I'm gonna have all this
[51:21] Bitcoin something's going to happen to
[51:22] me and my family's not going to be able
[51:23] to access it later so like where are you
[51:26] worried um or I'm worried that
[51:28] somebody's going to try and change
[51:30] Bitcoin and it's not going to function
[51:32] the way that I was promised
[51:35] um and so for each of those there's a
[51:39] tool there's a thing that you can do and
[51:43] in some instances some of those things
[51:45] are a little bit at odds like being
[51:49] super private and hidden away and secure
[51:52] may not perfectly line up with your
[51:56] having a super easy time accessing your
[51:59] Bitcoin if something bad happens to you
[52:02] those things I'm not going to say
[52:03] they're mutually exclusive but there's
[52:07] there's not a ton of overlap there in
[52:10] ease of use for uninitiated bitcoiners
[52:14] to uh censorship resistant super private
[52:19] hidden Bitcoin so like in in some
[52:23] instances you may be evaluating buckets
[52:25] of risk and diversifying in the tools
[52:29] that you use for the particular job um
[52:32] and so yeah like you start at the
[52:35] beginning of the journey where am I
[52:36] going to obtain Bitcoin well um you know
[52:40] if I'm super worried about privacy I'm
[52:41] going to go peer toer I'm going to use
[52:43] something like I don't know hoddle
[52:45] hoddle or bis or Robo sets or or a local
[52:48] Meetup where I'm buying actually from an
[52:50] individual if it's I want to get Bitcoin
[52:52] as quickly as I can as conveniently as I
[52:54] can you're going to find some sort of
[52:56] online exchange and that may require a
[52:59] trade-off in
[53:00] privacy
[53:02] um then beyond that okay I'm worried
[53:05] about getting rug pulled sitting on an
[53:07] exchange as you should be okay get it
[53:10] off and get it into self- custody that's
[53:12] already a huge win make sure that you
[53:14] have a backup and you know that your
[53:17] family knows where that backup is but
[53:20] then comes the I'm worried about
[53:23] somebody coming to my house and
[53:25] stumbling across or explicitly finding
[53:28] my seed phrase and taking my
[53:30] money okay so you maybe you're going to
[53:32] add a pass phrase you got to make sure
[53:34] your family knows the pass phrase maybe
[53:36] you're going to introduce something like
[53:39] multisig and then you've got a little
[53:42] bit of work cut out for you and making
[53:44] your family understand where those
[53:46] pieces are and then how to use them um
[53:49] you know oh I'm worried about somebody
[53:51] changing Bitcoin what if somebody tries
[53:54] to change the supply to 21 minut well
[53:57] you you're going to take your Bitcoin
[53:59] wallets that you're using and you're
[54:01] going to point them towards your own
[54:02] node that hosts a copy of the rules that
[54:05] govern the network and so if somebody
[54:07] tries to change it you and many others
[54:11] will ignore that change um and so
[54:14] there's there's all these different
[54:15] things that you can partake
[54:17] in based on your perceived risks and
[54:21] again the Privacy stuff you can be doing
[54:23] coin Jour using layers that give you
[54:25] privacy there's to always tools for the
[54:28] job but the tools don't always overlap
[54:32] in a perfect harmony there's going to be
[54:36] tradeoffs depending on what you decide
[54:38] to use for what
[54:40] purpose absolutely and that that's where
[54:43] you really like you have to ask yourself
[54:46] like all all those questions like okayy
[54:47] what happens when this what happens with
[54:49] death and like then have to strategies
[54:50] in place for that really cool um I'm
[54:53] really interested in what what you say
[54:55] about that what what is the biggest
[54:57] knowledge Gap uh in in the Bitcoin
[54:59] Community which would which you would
[55:01] like to to
[55:03] close
[55:04] um that's a good one
[55:07] um I
[55:09] mean most bitcoiners that I interact
[55:12] with day-to-day and I'm sure that you
[55:14] interact with day-to-day a lot of them
[55:17] at least understand that self- custody
[55:19] is important and I know that there's
[55:22] definitely people that don't have self-
[55:24] custody if you don't like you you need
[55:26] to get on top of that you need to that's
[55:28] a that's lwh hanging fruit that you
[55:30] should start learning about
[55:33] um I think that you know multisig is a
[55:37] very useful tool that's only getting
[55:39] better that people should take a peak
[55:43] into and the reason that I say that is
[55:47] um despite having many moving Parts the
[55:51] whole reason it has many moving Parts is
[55:53] you can screw up a whole bunch of them
[55:55] simultaneously and still be okay that's
[55:58] it's the the whole thing is Fault
[56:00] tolerance if you make mistakes as many
[56:04] people do you still have recourse down
[56:08] the line and again this is this is
[56:10] really going to be taken to the extreme
[56:11] with multisig um and some of the
[56:14] developments in that realm uh over the
[56:17] next I mean right now but especially
[56:19] over the next few years that's going to
[56:21] develop very well where you can screw up
[56:23] in a whole host of different ways and
[56:25] still be okay and that's very attractive
[56:27] for not losing your wealth for knowing
[56:30] that that you're secure um I think I
[56:33] think that's worth taking a peak into
[56:35] and and being privy to um and then the
[56:38] other thing I think the biggest wealth
[56:39] Gap or biggest not wealth Gap but uh
[56:42] knowledge Gap may not even
[56:45] be specific to a certain thing but more
[56:48] so
[56:50] um
[56:52] people thinking that they need to know
[56:55] everything about about a topic before
[56:57] they try it and that's not how Learning
[57:00] Works you learn by doing and
[57:04] so what I would say to people if you're
[57:07] curious about running a node if you're
[57:10] curious about having a a hobbyist home
[57:14] Miner or something like that
[57:16] um
[57:18] the the act of getting your hands dirty
[57:22] is the learning medium this is how you
[57:25] obtain the knowledge not by going out
[57:28] and reading a bunch of stuff and saying
[57:30] ah now I perfectly understand it and
[57:33] when I get this device in front of me
[57:35] I'm going to be able to execute
[57:36] perfectly no no no it's getting the
[57:39] thing starting okay what's what do I do
[57:42] first encountering issues and going I
[57:45] don't oh what happened I don't
[57:47] understand and then answering those
[57:49] questions for yourself or finding
[57:50] resources to answer those questions
[57:52] that's how you actually learn so um I I
[57:55] think the biggest
[57:56] knowledge Gap uh I would say is more a
[57:59] confidence Gap have confidence in
[58:02] yourself that you can try things without
[58:06] risking much and you will come out of it
[58:10] on the other side having leveled up and
[58:13] had a great having a greater
[58:14] understanding of the intricacies of how
[58:16] Bitcoin actually works all that's a
[58:19] that's a good
[58:20] one you have to you have to try it and
[58:22] you have to do it and it's like with
[58:25] with so many things where people are
[58:27] like studying things and then never
[58:29] doing it it's I see I see it all all all
[58:32] the time I have a friend still to the
[58:35] stay he he read the Bitcoin standard but
[58:37] never purchased any Bitcoin and he read
[58:40] the Bitcoin standard around uh three
[58:42] years ago and I'm like some point it
[58:45] will be time but
[58:48] yeah it's like getting your hands dirty
[58:51] is sometimes uh you learn better than
[58:53] with just theories with being so long
[58:56] Bitcoin how how much would you say
[58:58] you're already living on a on a Bitcoin
[59:01] standard uh you probably still have
[59:03] feied income definitely from from
[59:06] YouTube and other sources uh but how
[59:09] much is are you already down the line of
[59:12] a fat of a Bitcoin
[59:14] standard uh so 95% of my income is
[59:17] Bitcoin I live primarily on bitcoin and
[59:20] I have since
[59:21] 2020 um so I yeah I I invoice in Bitcoin
[59:27] so it's funny I'm in Canada my unit of
[59:31] account that I actually use is US
[59:33] dollars because the Canadian moose
[59:35] shekele is just garbage so I do I do not
[59:39] like I don't even denominate in Canadian
[59:41] dollars everything I think is is US
[59:44] dollars as pricing and then I uh my
[59:48] invoices are paid in Bitcoin or rather I
[59:53] can accept Fiat but I'm I'm so far far
[59:56] down that rabbit hole of I want to live
[59:58] on bitcoin that if somebody wants to pay
[60:00] me in Fiat I actually charge a premium
[60:02] and that premium is
[60:03] 15% because I really don't want the
[60:06] dollars like we we so we had Canadian
[60:09] bank accounts being shut down in 2022
[60:11] during the trucker protest and it's not
[60:13] that I didn't have problems with banks
[60:15] beforehand and they're just they've just
[60:18] been so hostile to bitcoiners overall
[60:22] that it was it's been a an absolute
[60:25] pleasure
[60:26] removing them as much as possible from
[60:28] my life it's not that I don't have a
[60:29] bank account or a credit card it's that
[60:32] I don't keep any value there I don't
[60:34] like I don't keep any any money beyond
[60:37] what needs to be there in Fiat and so um
[60:42] and yeah I and I do this through a
[60:44] variety of means we're lucky here in
[60:45] Canada we've got a couple different
[60:46] options for being able to pay regular
[60:49] bills with Bitcoin so Bitcoin well is a
[60:52] great resource here we've also got bull
[60:54] Bitcoin they're awesome and I think they
[60:56] just um um uh opened up in Europe as
[60:58] well uh and then uh I also use things
[61:02] like bit refill so I I'll get gift cards
[61:05] for things like gas and groceries and
[61:08] travel and whatever um but I think the
[61:11] the other most bullish thing on that
[61:14] particular Topic in living on bitcoin is
[61:17] I recognize that using these Services is
[61:20] very nice and it makes it simple but
[61:23] there's still a Reliance on a Central
[61:26] entity to string those things together
[61:29] hey I want to pay this bill I'm going to
[61:31] pay it in Bitcoin through this entity
[61:34] that does all the dirty work on the
[61:36] other side and converts and blah blah
[61:37] blah how do you escape that so that if
[61:43] somebody came along and said you're not
[61:44] allowed to do that anymore you're hooped
[61:47] um well it's by using Bitcoin directly
[61:50] getting the things you need for Bitcoin
[61:52] from somebody who wants the Bitcoin so
[61:54] we started doing that here in my city uh
[61:57] so I live in Calgary Alberta and uh we
[62:00] started something called the SAT market
[62:02] and so this is a circular Market we
[62:04] started we just started at the Bitcoin
[62:06] Meetup and we said hey like you're all
[62:09] bitcoiners you all know that this is
[62:10] better money you all have skills and you
[62:13] offer goods and
[62:14] services um and you all earn dollars and
[62:17] then convert some of those dollars to
[62:19] bitcoin why don't you cut out one of
[62:21] those steps and just accept Bitcoin and
[62:23] any Bitcoin that you get you sure you
[62:25] can save it or you can spend it at other
[62:27] vendors and so we started this just over
[62:30] a year ago um so Christmas 2023 we've
[62:34] had a few markets already we've host
[62:36] them a couple times a year um but the
[62:38] goal is to create a community of people
[62:40] that I can get whatever I need it was a
[62:44] very selfish action I set it up because
[62:46] I just wanted to live on bitcoin but
[62:48] it's it's become a thing and so like our
[62:50] last Market was uh in December here um
[62:54] and uh we had I think 40 different
[62:58] vendors and it's not just like hey like
[63:00] here's a Bitcoin shirt or a hat or
[63:02] whatever there's some of that too which
[63:03] is great but it it's like things that I
[63:07] need dayto day there's Farmers I can get
[63:09] beef eggs chicken um you know there's uh
[63:12] people with like honey and tea and all
[63:16] these different things there's Tradesmen
[63:17] so there's people doing flooring and
[63:19] Roofing and electricians and I have a
[63:22] personal trainer and I have uh a cleaner
[63:26] and I have like like all of these
[63:27] different things that I actually use
[63:31] dayto I have a dentist now that accepts
[63:33] Bitcoin I've got like so I'm I'm
[63:35] starting to fill all these gaps where
[63:38] rather than having to go through a
[63:39] service I can just go get the thing I
[63:41] need for Bitcoin and I'm also finding
[63:44] that the quality of the goods that I'm
[63:46] getting more thought and effort is put
[63:49] into producing and and providing the
[63:52] good or service because you're paying
[63:55] them in a money
[63:56] that actually retains value and they
[63:58] want your repeat business and so um yeah
[64:02] I'm I'm super super excited about if
[64:04] anybody's curious actually and you kind
[64:06] of want to see what we're doing we do
[64:08] have a website called uh it's called
[64:09] Bitcoin satm
[64:11] market.com and um and yeah so like we're
[64:15] just kind of we've got an initial kind
[64:17] of concept page up and everything but I
[64:19] think we're going to be chronicling what
[64:21] we've done so far and uh hoping that
[64:25] people will replicate it and I'd love to
[64:27] have people come up to Calgary and see
[64:29] our next uh sap Market which is going to
[64:31] be at the end of June is that that
[64:34] that's us yes indeed so I mean like
[64:36] we've got yeah I mean we've we've done a
[64:39] few and uh you know we we've but this is
[64:42] just kind of like a listing of some of
[64:43] the vendors that we've had oh yeah
[64:45] that's I've got I've got a plumber too
[64:47] I've got a Bitcoin plumber that's been
[64:48] to my house a couple times because my
[64:49] kids like to shove stuff down the toilet
[64:53] so but yeah like we've we've got uh we
[64:56] we've got like a fair amount of people
[64:58] that have been through the community and
[65:01] actually we've gotten people coming our
[65:03] last Market in
[65:05] December Canada's a big country just to
[65:08] give you an idea if I were to drive to
[65:11] Toronto from here um we it would take me
[65:16] four
[65:17] days uh to drive and so like a flight to
[65:21] Toronto is five hours we had we had
[65:25] people in from Toronto Montreal
[65:27] Vancouver Edmonton um Colona like all
[65:31] these places that are hours away some of
[65:33] them drove eight hours to be here uh
[65:36] some of them flew five hours to be here
[65:38] some and and so people are so passionate
[65:42] about this kind of thing that they're
[65:45] willing to travel across the country to
[65:47] be a part of it and it's super exciting
[65:49] and so um yeah I encourage people to
[65:52] come check it out we're going to we're
[65:54] going to have that and uh a a small
[65:57] conference called the Bitcoin Rodeo uh
[66:00] around the exact same time and I think
[66:02] we're going to do a workshop with
[66:04] Bitcoin Mentor out in the Rocky
[66:05] Mountains as well right around the same
[66:07] time so uh come to Calgary it's it's
[66:10] going to be fun really cool that that's
[66:13] amazing I mean there's this for me silly
[66:16] notion of like you do not sell your
[66:18] Bitcoin uh which also would apply like
[66:20] don't spend it but I think it's it's
[66:23] probably better to say like don't sell
[66:25] them spend them like that would be
[66:27] probably the the better way of like
[66:29] going about things um I'm curious uh you
[66:33] you explained it a little bit but do you
[66:35] have like a card where you uh directly
[66:38] get uh get get the Bitcoin converted to
[66:41] to Euros or like do you pay like once a
[66:43] month the thing like how does that work
[66:45] for you yeah so um with Bitcoin well and
[66:49] with bull Bitcoin in Canada what they do
[66:51] is they've kind of plugged into some of
[66:55] the payment processors that uh handle
[66:58] billing like Countrywide and so what
[67:00] they're able to do is uh on their
[67:04] platforms they'll say like okay who's
[67:06] the biller you trying to pay and you
[67:07] look up the company maybe it's you know
[67:10] I'm paying for my internet bill or my
[67:12] phone bill or whatever uh and they say
[67:14] okay now enter the account number that
[67:16] you have with this biller and then they
[67:19] say how much do you want to pay on the
[67:20] bill and you just designate the amount
[67:22] in Canadian dollars um and then they'll
[67:25] say great great we'll handle that for
[67:26] you uh pay this much Bitcoin to this
[67:29] Bitcoin address or to this lightning
[67:31] address or they also do liquid as well
[67:33] so you know you can kind of pick how you
[67:36] want to pay you pay the thing and then
[67:38] they handle it in the back end so
[67:39] they'll they'll con convert to Fiat
[67:42] they'll make the bill payment through
[67:43] the the national uh payment rails and it
[67:47] just gets taken care of so there's that
[67:50] for things that I can't directly pay um
[67:54] it's either I use a credit card and then
[67:56] I can pay off the credit card with
[67:58] Bitcoin or it's I'm going to go buy a
[68:00] gift card with bit refill and again get
[68:03] what I need or the most exciting one of
[68:06] course is just buying it locally through
[68:08] people that I know and actually have a
[68:10] relationship with that is really cool
[68:13] and I like the the thing that you said
[68:15] of like you get higher quality things
[68:17] because you pay in a money that's
[68:19] actually appreciating the one that that
[68:21] receives it and uh like just from
[68:24] personal uh uh um um experience last
[68:27] year I started also um accepting Bitcoin
[68:31] and now uh it's it's a it's a magical
[68:34] experience once you do it you you don't
[68:35] want to like the first time you you
[68:37] receive you you want to accept Bitcoin
[68:39] it's it's like frightening because like
[68:41] oh how do you invoice in in Bitcoin what
[68:43] tools should I use like what will my
[68:45] accountant say like do I have to like
[68:48] what do I have to do with with all those
[68:49] things but once you've done it like oh
[68:51] like it's it's no problem it's very easy
[68:53] actually uh uh is really cool what what
[68:57] do you uh the question that I want to
[68:59] get to is like what do you think is is
[69:01] the the impact or of of using Bitcoin as
[69:05] a money if that gets more prud in
[69:07] society if it's not only a small early
[69:09] adopters group uh but if it's it get
[69:11] actually in a in a proud Society is like
[69:14] what is the impact of of Bitcoin for
[69:16] that yeah I think
[69:19] um I think it it not only positively
[69:24] impact so I mean the number one thing
[69:26] for me is uh it makes me obviously want
[69:32] to spend less than I earn right like the
[69:35] right now the the average mentality of
[69:38] of somebody in the west is they just
[69:40] kind of Doom spend right like because
[69:42] it's like unless you're like way way
[69:45] ahead um a lot of people just don't have
[69:47] a capacity to save and nor are they nor
[69:50] do they believe that they'll really get
[69:52] ahead by doing so and so like you're
[69:54] forced to either just Doom spend or
[69:56] gamble in the hopes that you might make
[69:59] it to retirement um Bitcoin is a
[70:02] different mentality so when you actually
[70:05] understand what it is and what it fixes
[70:08] then it
[70:09] encourages uh
[70:11] more more cognizant spending and more
[70:14] conscious saving um and so I think
[70:18] number one it impacts the way people
[70:20] interact with money it interact it it
[70:23] impacts the types of goods that that
[70:25] they buy and so what what I found too is
[70:29] with Bitcoin when I'm getting stuff
[70:32] dayto day that I might need for my home
[70:34] or
[70:35] whatever I am way more likely to
[70:39] actually buy the more expensive thing
[70:42] that is going to last me forever instead
[70:46] of the cheap thing that's going to break
[70:48] and I'm going to need to
[70:49] replace um I want high quality things
[70:53] that are going to last forever so an
[70:54] example when we first moved into the
[70:57] house that we're in now we needed a
[70:59] kitchen table we're looking at like Ikea
[71:02] and stuff like that and we're thinking
[71:03] uh maybe this one maybe that one looks
[71:05] nice now and we realized that that piece
[71:09] of furniture is going to fall apart and
[71:13] look ugly much much more quickly and we
[71:16] wanted something that was going to be
[71:18] there that that we'll just have until
[71:20] we're old and then maybe just pass on to
[71:22] our kids so what I ended up doing is is
[71:25] I paid in Bitcoin uh I got somebody that
[71:28] I knew locally to build me a table the
[71:31] base is solid oak and the top is like uh
[71:35] is it Granite I can't remember anyways
[71:37] it's like it's like the table weighs
[71:39] like 350 pounds or something like that
[71:43] if my house was hit by a tornado the
[71:45] table would still be here and so that
[71:49] table we'll have it for the rest of our
[71:52] lives and it'll probably go to our kid
[71:56] so like versus the crappy Ikea table
[71:59] that actually probably wouldn't have
[72:01] cost that much less would have been in a
[72:04] few years we' be like oh this a piece of
[72:05] crap let's get a new one so like it
[72:07] changes your mentality around that so
[72:09] like I think we're going to be in a
[72:11] world where all of a sudden there's
[72:13] going to be because it's not going to be
[72:15] everybody switches a Bitcoin at once
[72:17] there's going to be people living in the
[72:18] future now and people seeing the
[72:21] difference that that plays out and so
[72:23] there's going to be a class of people
[72:24] that
[72:25] are wealthier healthier and have all the
[72:29] coolest
[72:30]  and everybody else is going to be
[72:33] like poror fat and everything that they
[72:36] own
[72:37] breaks so and they're going to be like
[72:40] what what's happening over here why is
[72:43] everybody flourishing and it's literally
[72:44] going to be just change your money and
[72:47] you'll change your life I just I had in
[72:50] in my head this sailor meme of like we
[72:52] call them poor
[72:55] yeah yeah I mean it's it's it impacts a
[72:58] lot and um a lot of people can be very
[73:02] dismissive of oh just changing the money
[73:04] doesn't really change that much it might
[73:06] have an impact but not that no I firmly
[73:09] believe that it
[73:11] permeates and and causes Ripple effects
[73:14] through every other facet of everyone's
[73:17] lives once they make that shift I have I
[73:19] have one question that ask each and
[73:21] every one of my guests and the question
[73:22] is what can we learn from you besides
[73:25] Bitcoin ooh um
[73:27] I've I've found that through my Bitcoin
[73:31] Journey it's made me question a lot in
[73:34] and around everything else in my life
[73:37] and uh even just kind of the way I carry
[73:41] myself the way that I treat my body the
[73:44] way that I interact in my relationships
[73:46] and and how I think of them
[73:50] um so I mean what I would say outside of
[73:54] Bitcoin is is uh look
[73:57] into what I'm on a kick of right now is
[73:59] what am I consuming in terms of what am
[74:02] I putting into my body and what I'm how
[74:04] am I using my body in a way that
[74:07] benefits it rather than hurts it and
[74:10] when you look into the food system um
[74:13] you know I read Fiat food which was eye
[74:15] openening and I'm I'm on a kick of how
[74:18] can I improve upon what I'm doing to
[74:20] myself uh and it's a struggle you
[74:22] realize like how much of a a stronghold
[74:25] Fiat Health has on you and uh it's tough
[74:28] to break out of that so I I'd say if
[74:30] anything maybe you can't learn it
[74:32] directly from me because I'm still in
[74:34] the the learning process but if anything
[74:36] go read Fiat food scream at the pages
[74:39] because of how angry you are over the
[74:41] corruption and then uh and then take
[74:43] some action uh to actually change your
[74:46] life in and around what you're doing to
[74:48] your own body absolutely and uh it's
[74:52] it's I had I had a I had Matthew on also
[74:54] from fat food uh he he he was is great
[74:59] um I think it's a it it was a it was a
[75:02] lot of I learn a lot of new things about
[75:04] the food supply especially and those
[75:06] things yeah uh really cool we have an
[75:08] end rtin in the podcast where the
[75:10] previous guest is asking a question for
[75:11] the next guest without knowing who the
[75:13] next guest actually is um and the
[75:15] previous guest is asking you the
[75:17] question which is the most inspiring
[75:19] story on bitcoin which you ever heard
[75:22] ooh um yeah I I know right away what it
[75:25] is
[75:27] um I've been doing some work with the
[75:29] human rights Foundation the past couple
[75:31] of years uh past three years maybe more
[75:34] official capacity this past year um but
[75:37] I went to my first Oslo Freedom Forum
[75:40] in
[75:42] 2022 and I listened to um a a woman on
[75:47] stage from Nicaragua and she was talking
[75:49] about her husband uh who was opposing
[75:52] the local government and uh running
[75:55] against them and and giving basically
[75:58] throwing up red flags like hey these
[76:00] these guys are leaning very
[76:02] totalitarian um he when she was given
[76:05] the speech he had been abducted she
[76:08] hadn't seen him in two years um he was
[76:10] in a Nicaraguan prison somewhere they
[76:12] had a daughter together that was I think
[76:15] seven when that initially happened um
[76:18] and so I listened to this and I was oh
[76:20] my God what a horrid story um later on
[76:23] in that at that same conf conference I
[76:25] did a workshop on how to use a Bitcoin
[76:28] wallet and how to send and receive and
[76:30] everything um when I watched that talk I
[76:33] was kind of far away so I couldn't
[76:34] really see who she was um but unbeknown
[76:37] to me she was at that workshop and then
[76:40] afterwards had tons of questions and she
[76:41] was learning how to use Bitcoin wallets
[76:43] and everything oh so like I can get
[76:44] money into and out of the country um
[76:47] without it stopping and like let's
[76:49] figure out how what I can do with it
[76:51] once it's there and all all this
[76:53] stuff um and and uh so she then started
[76:59] kind of integrating that into her work
[77:00] to help fund their efforts and I showed
[77:04] up next year to the same event and the
[77:06] first person out to speak on the stage
[77:09] was her
[77:10] husband and he had been freed and the
[77:13] first thing that they played on the
[77:16] screen was his reunion with his daughter
[77:18] for the first time in two and a half
[77:19] three years and like I was a mess I was
[77:22] a wreck in that front row and then they
[77:25] bring her his daughter out on stage with
[77:27] him and everything and I'm just like oh
[77:29] my God like I had to I had to leave the
[77:32] room after that and just go for a walk
[77:34] like call my wife I'm not doing okay
[77:36] here like it's really good but holy God
[77:39] uh and so and then after that um this
[77:42] past year in October I got to meet the
[77:47] whole family uh well rather I got to
[77:50] meet her husband um and you know I'm
[77:53] kind of helping them them on the Bitcoin
[77:55] front a little bit and it's just kind of
[77:57] come full circle but um just and and
[77:59] she's now helping with education in and
[78:02] around Bitcoin and so it's just like
[78:06] like that that that trajectory of what's
[78:09] happening there is some of it's one of
[78:11] the most inspiring things that I've ever
[78:14] experienced and it's just like one of
[78:15] the most like that that thing for me I I
[78:20] don't know how how much more I can
[78:23] communicate that but like it's it's been
[78:25] one of the most impactful things that
[78:27] I've experienced so yeah there you go
[78:30] that that that's probably the most
[78:31] Wholesome Way of of closing this podcast
[78:34] so I will I I will not do any any bad
[78:37] and and say anything to it I think
[78:39] that's a it's it's a really cool and an
[78:42] inspiring story really wholesome really
[78:44] I love that um before I let you go I
[78:47] usually ask the guest like where can we
[78:49] will find you but they probably already
[78:51] aware of you but for the a few people
[78:53] that aren't aware you we I can Define
[78:56] you ask your questions and reach out to
[78:57] you yeah yeah so um if you're looking to
[79:01] learn and get educated on on Bitcoin in
[79:03] the Practical how to just go to YouTube
[79:05] and search BTC sessions and there's a
[79:07] ton of content there that you can find
[79:09] in tutorials and if you're looking to
[79:11] use a wallet or or something you could
[79:14] you could probably find a video on it
[79:15] I've probably done it um if you need a
[79:18] little bit more handholding and you need
[79:20] some one-on-one help uh my company is
[79:23] called Bitcoin Mentor so you can find us
[79:25] at Bitcoin mentor. and that's where you
[79:27] can reach out and whatever problems
[79:30] you're working through whatever help
[79:32] that you need you can find it there um
[79:34] and then of course you already pulled it
[79:36] up but Bitcoin sat Market if you're
