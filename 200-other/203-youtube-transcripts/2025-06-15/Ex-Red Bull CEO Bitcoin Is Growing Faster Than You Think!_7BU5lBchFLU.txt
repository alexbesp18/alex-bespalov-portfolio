[00:00] we see this space of innovation keeps on
[00:02] getting faster the same way like CH GPT
[00:05] reach 100 million user much faster than
[00:08] Netflix did Netflix was faster than
[00:10] mobile phones mobile phones were faster
[00:12] than the internet things can go much
[00:14] faster than we think we sometimes
[00:16] overestimate what can be done in one
[00:18] year and underestimate what can happen
[00:20] in 5 years who would have said just a
[00:22] year ago that the next US president will
[00:25] be supporting Bitcoin so much I wonder
[00:27] if the US government will announce Co
[00:30] Reserve or they would rather start
[00:32] accumulating behind the scene many
[00:34] governments are doing it most of them
[00:36] are not saying it the ETF success were
[00:39] really amazing it was a major push and
[00:41] transformation for Bitcoin Bitcoin ETFs
[00:44] were the most successful ETFs ever
[00:46] introduced in the US and this is just
[00:48] the beginning when the gold ETFs were
[00:50] introduced year two three and four kept
[00:53] on growing the inflows kept on
[00:55] increasing so we expect the inflows into
[00:58] Bitcoin ETFs to grow in 25 26 27 you
[01:02] make a simulation how many Bitcoins you
[01:04] have how many you will acquire the next
[01:06] couple of years when you retire and how
[01:08] you can live out of
[01:09] [Music]
[01:13] that usually I don't ask my guests to
[01:17] introduce themselves um but I think it's
[01:20] very interesting to know your background
[01:23] as a CEO of many big companies uh so
[01:27] what what did you do so far and and
[01:29] what's your background
[01:31] so I'm I'm a global CEO with experience
[01:34] across the United States Europe Asia and
[01:38] the Middle East most recently I used to
[01:41] be the CEO for Red Bull North
[01:44] America uh before leaving Red Bull and
[01:47] coming and before that I was a CEO for
[01:49] Red Bull Asia
[01:51] Pacific and then the last 15 years I was
[01:54] CEO for a familyowned
[01:56] business which was acquired by private
[01:59] equity so we moved from family owned to
[02:02] private Equity Bank I did my IPO in
[02:05] Saudi Arabia in
[02:07] 2016 and I was a CEO for a publicly
[02:10] listed company that's my background and
[02:14] the last 20 plus years I was independent
[02:17] non-executive director on several
[02:21] companies where I very much
[02:24] enjoy uh supporting boards and CEOs and
[02:29] management teams really cool
[02:33] love amazing um maybe I just directly
[02:37] jump into that for like Bitcoin for CEOs
[02:41] Bitcoin for professionals H it's a it's
[02:43] a it's a big chumper yes uh yesterday or
[02:46] like the the day the day before we had
[02:48] something with Bitcoin for African women
[02:51] and it's a it's a big jum now as a
[02:53] contrast here I think that's the that's
[02:55] what I try to do in the Bitcoin podcast
[02:57] to have as many perspectives on bitcoin
[02:59] as possible possible um how did you as
[03:03] an extremely busy CEO of big comp
[03:06] companies came to bitcoin like how did
[03:08] it across your
[03:10] radar that's a great question Robin I
[03:13] heard first about Bitcoin in
[03:16] 2016 I was at a wedding and a young
[03:19] cousin from the family was doing a PhD
[03:23] on Bitcoin in 2016 and he told me at
[03:26] that time Bitcoin will ultimately reach
[03:29] 100k one day I was I was so busy with my
[03:34] full-time CEO role and the boards I sit
[03:37] on I did not really pay attention to it
[03:40] until
[03:41] 2019 when I was at an investment
[03:44] conference in Washington DC about
[03:47] technology and Innovation I have a I
[03:50] have a hobby and I love technology and
[03:52] Innovation I invested in many startups
[03:55] and I was there listening to at that
[03:57] time Quantum Computing a I biotech solar
[04:02] technology and then there was this
[04:03] gentleman on stage he came and mentioned
[04:06] Bitcoin and
[04:08] cryptocurrencies and I said to myself s
[04:12] you missed the train in
[04:13] 2016 you will not miss another
[04:16] opportunity in 2019 so I
[04:19] got uh intellectually curious I rolled
[04:22] up my sleeves and 2019 I started
[04:26] learning about Bitcoin and I followed a
[04:30] very simple strategy from 2019 till
[04:33] today of Simply DCA buying on a weekly
[04:38] or monthly basis and holding Bitcoin I
[04:41] never sold my Bitcoin and I was spending
[04:44] a lot of time on my free time because
[04:46] CEOs like myself and board members are
[04:50] super busy Robin they don't have the
[04:52] time to follow X and follow YouTube and
[04:56] podcast so I really gave a lot of my
[04:59] free time on my vacation working for
[05:03] hours listening to podcast and reading
[05:06] books the Bitcoin standards was my first
[05:09] book and making research online and
[05:12] frankly it's very lonely to be a
[05:15] bitcoiner because there are very few
[05:17] people around you who understand it
[05:20] there are very few people who will be
[05:22] interested in listening to
[05:24] you and many people would laugh at me
[05:27] when the price goes down and when the
[05:29] price goes up they think I'm a
[05:31] genius and uh I went through this
[05:34] journey for five years what was really
[05:36] amazing for me were few things the
[05:39] conferences I attended multiple Bitcoin
[05:42] conferences before we meet in Abu Dhabi
[05:45] and I was impressed by the talent and
[05:49] the smart people from different
[05:51] industries from the tech industry from
[05:54] the finance industry even we had people
[05:58] from JP Morgan and Goldman sax in
[06:00] Nashville in July 24 and from low firms
[06:04] and Regulatory environment so when I saw
[06:06] all this talent I said oh my God I'm not
[06:09] that crazy there is something you know
[06:11] substantial behind
[06:13] Bitcoin today I have to say it's much
[06:16] easier for people to learn about Bitcoin
[06:19] it's much easier to get on board and I
[06:22] say to many friends of mine guys you
[06:24] cannot disregard the more successful
[06:27] ETFs which ever happened
[06:29] in 2024 maybe my background as an
[06:32] engineer I studied computer science
[06:35] engineering did help me in getting down
[06:37] the rabbit hole because the more I
[06:40] learned Robin the more I had
[06:42] questions and it can get very technical
[06:45] very challenging I understand people who
[06:48] tell me I don't have the time for it I
[06:51] don't understand it I respect those
[06:53] people however I get a bit disappointed
[06:56] from people who don't do their homework
[06:58] and simply repeat Warren Buffett said I
[07:01] would not buy the whole Bitcoins for $25
[07:05] or Jamie Diamond until today saying most
[07:09] of the Bitcoin transfers are drug
[07:12] related they people who are not on board
[07:16] use those statements as an excuse to
[07:19] justify their position I don't know
[07:22] anyone who did their
[07:24] homework and got facts and who does not
[07:29] you know somehow believe into it and
[07:31] decide to dip there too into
[07:34] Bitcoin and I also want to make this
[07:36] episode uh I'm really excited also for
[07:39] this one because I think it always makes
[07:42] sense if you hear it from a peer so if
[07:44] someone in the audience has some uh sea
[07:46] level executive as an uncle or father or
[07:49] as like someone as a friend or something
[07:52] like that and they cannot get to them
[07:53] maybe they're like hey here is a sea
[07:55] level executive maybe he can explain it
[07:58] to you in like one hour like that maybe
[08:00] you listen to them because I think we we
[08:02] like to hear from our peers uh rather
[08:05] from someone that we cannot relate to so
[08:08] uh that's why I have like teachers also
[08:10] on and because like teachers teachers
[08:13] probably cannot relate to Michael
[08:15] sailor uh but but uh the same way as an
[08:18] executive cannot relate to to a teacher
[08:21] maybe that much so I think that's really
[08:22] important to have Bitcoin education and
[08:25] adoption in
[08:26] there very to very good point
[08:29] and this is why when I talk to my peers
[08:33] many of them who are 50 years and above
[08:36] are in their comfort zone Robin they
[08:39] have a winning formula as a 6040
[08:41] portfolio or they have a real estate you
[08:44] know portfolio and they are doing x% per
[08:47] year five six% per year and they're very
[08:50] happy about it and there is no sense of
[08:52] urgency however I tell them guys the
[08:55] world is changing there is so much
[08:58] inflation we all going to live longer
[09:00] than our parents and our
[09:03] grandparents many more people will reach
[09:05] hundred years and above and how do you
[09:08] secure your financial well-being as
[09:11] you're
[09:12] Aging in the past people used to retire
[09:15] at 60 years old and they could live well
[09:17] for 25 30 years we are going to stay
[09:20] longer and that's why I appreciate that
[09:23] CEOs are very busy and board
[09:25] members Unfortunately today Robin there
[09:28] is no one single place where those
[09:32] people can quickly go in one two three
[09:34] days get a download of Bitcoin
[09:37] professionals ask me S how can I quickly
[09:39] learn about Bitcoin I don't have the
[09:41] time to go on
[09:42] X people C Level professionals don't
[09:46] have your time and my time to spend at
[09:48] least one to two hours a day on podcast
[09:50] and on X and I'm looking forward to the
[09:52] day where Business Schools like London
[09:55] Business School in sead IMD in
[09:58] Switzerland Harvard introduce a Bitcoin
[10:00] course this should be a fantastic
[10:02] education for CFOs CEOs and equivalent
[10:06] to go there get a quick download so what
[10:09] I recommend to
[10:11] CEOs around me please read the Bitcoin
[10:14] standards it's not a big book 80% is
[10:18] very interesting is about the history of
[10:20] money and 20% only is about Bitcoin so
[10:24] you will learn a lot there should be a
[10:25] place where CEO CFOs can get a quick
[10:28] download
[10:30] because today I'm trying to orange pill
[10:33] some companies to consider adding
[10:35] Bitcoin on the balance
[10:37] sheet and the challenge is people don't
[10:42] find an easy way to learn about Bitcoin
[10:46] so when I tell them read this book go to
[10:48] those
[10:49] websites follow some people on YouTube
[10:52] watch some YouTube videos they don't
[10:54] have the time to be honest agenda of
[10:57] CEOs and boards are very busy boards
[11:01] Robin are meeting four to six times a
[11:04] year we have every meeting is roughly
[11:07] three to four hours maximum board
[11:10] agendas are very
[11:12] loaded and companies frankly have decent
[11:15] profits and decent dividends so there's
[11:17] no sense of urgency the challenge we
[11:20] have today how can we educate this
[11:24] target audience in a much better way and
[11:27] when you see the Microsoft shareholder
[11:31] voting outcome where only 55%
[11:36] supported getting Bitcoin B on the
[11:38] balance sheet people are using this
[11:40] against me by saying sell him even five
[11:44] or 10 or 15% of shareholders 0
[11:47] 55 this is a joke forget it let's please
[11:51] have a more serious
[11:52] discussions so now Amazon and meta will
[11:56] vote I assume the outcome will be
[11:58] similar
[12:00] unfortunately but the day Robin the day
[12:04] one large public listed company gets
[12:07] Bitcoin the balance sheet this should be
[12:10] similar to what the ETFs did on January
[12:13] 11 for
[12:15] institutions pensions High networks
[12:18] individuals and family offices I'm
[12:21] really waiting for this day but even if
[12:23] this day happens assume tomorrow meta
[12:26] approves Bitcoin the balance sheet you
[12:29] have a population of CEOs and CFOs and
[12:32] Boards who have to do their Duty and
[12:36] their homework to understand Bitcoin
[12:38] before recommending it and there is a
[12:41] challenge I'm trying to make a list of
[12:43] experts whom I can bring to some boards
[12:46] but again it's extremely time consuming
[12:48] I think things will change the next 5 10
[12:51] years but this is really a long journey
[12:54] but this there are fantastic
[12:56] opportunities for corporations who
[12:58] embrace it today but it's a process
[13:01] which will take quite some time there is
[13:02] a beautiful report from River I don't
[13:05] know if you saw it couple of months ago
[13:07] listing private entities and public
[13:10] listed companies how better their
[13:13] performance is since they adopted
[13:16] Bitcoin today there are 60 publicly
[13:19] listed companies adopting Bitcoin on the
[13:21] balance
[13:22] sheets and by the way you know there are
[13:24] many implications for a company to adopt
[13:27] Bitcoin the balance sheet
[13:29] the last one was Rumble 48 hours ago
[13:33] Rumble adding so we can't follow anymore
[13:36] every day there is a new company adding
[13:39] Bitcoin the balance sheet and then when
[13:42] you do that when you see the performance
[13:43] of Bitcoin you start asking yourself
[13:45] many questions about other Investments
[13:48] corporations is a really interesting
[13:49] topic is also I think um most people
[13:52] don't realized how busy SE level
[13:55] executives are and also don't realize
[13:59] that they are the the keys basically for
[14:01] the corporate adoption we always talk
[14:03] about um the corporate adoption of
[14:06] Bitcoin and corporations adopting
[14:08] Bitcoin but at the end of the day it's
[14:10] still individuals it's still human
[14:12] beings that adopt Bitcoin uh and it's
[14:15] then those C- level Executives uh that
[14:18] make the decision if they do it or not
[14:21] uh and it's it's really vital for for
[14:23] the the Bitcoin adoption my my question
[14:25] would be like uh you mentioned it with
[14:27] the ETFs how helpful was how how big of
[14:30] an impact made the ETF the black rug
[14:33] involvement and and traditional Finance
[14:36] uh people coming more and more into the
[14:38] space how big of an impact did that make
[14:40] on on on those companies ETF
[14:42] introduction and the ETF success were
[14:46] really amazing it was a major push and
[14:48] transformation for Bitcoin I would say
[14:51] moving from retail investors to
[14:56] institutions from what we call weaker
[14:58] hands to Diamond hands when you see
[15:01] Pension funds when you see large
[15:05] institutions endorsing uh Bitcoin buying
[15:08] Bitcoin when you see the Bitcoin ETFs
[15:11] was the most successful ETFs ever
[15:14] introduced in the
[15:15] US when you see the inflows into the
[15:19] ibit year one are much more than what
[15:22] happened into gold ETFs or since 20
[15:25] years and this is just the beginning by
[15:28] the way
[15:29] so ETFs are major Tailwinds for year two
[15:32] because historically Robin when the gold
[15:36] ETFs were introduced year two three and
[15:39] four kept on growing the inflows kept on
[15:42] increasing so we expect the inflows into
[15:46] Bitcoin ETFs to grow in 25 26 27 that's
[15:50] a major Tailwind this is a fantastic
[15:54] plus another
[15:55] major transformation and Tailwind is the
[15:59] us Administration moving from being a
[16:01] headwind to being a tailwind and 25 not
[16:05] just the president himself but most of
[16:08] the administration around him are pro
[16:11] Bitcoin there is a lot of positive
[16:14] changes
[16:15] happening now we expect the president
[16:19] to uh repeal sub 121 which was a major
[16:23] bipartisan bill which President Biden
[16:26] vetoed in the past and S 121 is Major
[16:30] because it will allow corporations Banks
[16:32] sorry to hold Bitcoin for individuals
[16:36] and corporations and give them loan the
[16:39] fastb accounting rule is Major for
[16:42] corporations because as of December 15
[16:45] only I don't know if you're aware of
[16:47] that as per the new fastb accounting
[16:50] rule companies can report the profits
[16:53] they make on the Bitcoin they hold and
[16:56] this was not the case in the past yeah
[16:59] that's that's major for for the
[17:01] corporate adoption and that's a
[17:03] overlooked overlooked thing often what
[17:05] do you actually expect for the coming
[17:08] years in 2025 but also in the coming
[17:10] years 2026 2027 uh for Bitcoin when we
[17:14] now have a
[17:16] positive um Administration in America we
[17:19] have ETFs going we have kind of the the
[17:22] groundwork for everything that we worked
[17:25] really hard is now late the education
[17:28] also as you mentioned is getting easier
[17:29] and easier so it's the the level of
[17:32] education is getting better and better
[17:35] what do you expect for for Bitcoin in in
[17:37] the in the coming years especially for
[17:39] corporate adoption I'm very bullish for
[17:41] corporate adoption and for institution
[17:45] adoptions and high networks
[17:48] individuals uh because of many things
[17:51] the ETFs number one number two companies
[17:55] getting Bitcoin on their uh uh balance
[17:59] sheet Miler Michael sailor 42
[18:04] billion um fund raised to buy Bitcoin
[18:07] this by itself can be a major driver the
[18:10] US Administration policy change the fast
[18:13] B by the way Black Rock now officially
[18:17] recommends minimum 2%
[18:20] allocation shv recommends 10%
[18:24] allocations I was really surprised when
[18:27] I watch this interview by a person at
[18:30] charv and president Trump you know
[18:34] reversing sub 121 there are a lot of
[18:36] thing I'm not even
[18:38] mentioning the big topic today which is
[18:42] countries buying Bitcoin on the on the
[18:46] treasury UT just announced before we
[18:49] speak now that there are they introduced
[18:52] a bill there are today 11 states 20% of
[18:56] the US states have introduced Bill to
[19:00] buy Bitcoin on the treasury at the state
[19:03] level we are waiting still for the
[19:06] executive orders of President Biden I
[19:10] think the F day one it was amazing they
[19:13] launched 100 executive orders now we
[19:16] expect in the other 100 there will be
[19:20] something related to bitcoin the rumor
[19:23] out there that there something there are
[19:25] so many Tailwinds
[19:26] frankly and black rock said recently the
[19:30] adoption of Bitcoin is faster than the
[19:34] adoption of mobile phones and the
[19:36] internet we see this pace of innovation
[19:40] keeps on getting faster the same way
[19:41] like CH GPT reach 100 million user much
[19:46] fast faster than Netflix did during
[19:49] covid four years ago Netflix was faster
[19:52] than mobile phones mobile phones were
[19:54] faster than the internet so as we move
[19:56] ahead there will be much more Innovation
[19:58] than next 10 year in the last 50 and
[20:01] therefore I say to
[20:04] leaders of organizations and board
[20:07] members you have a duty of foresight you
[20:10] have a duty of innovation of supporting
[20:15] companies as they evolve and part of
[20:18] your duty is to really consider a major
[20:21] you know new asset like you cannot
[20:23] disregard Bitcoin today it's a$2
[20:26] trillion dollar asset it's it's very
[20:29] risky to disregard that's the biggest uh
[20:31] thing the the that's the riskiest thing
[20:34] to completely ignore it that's very true
[20:37] how can we reach uh uh or in general uh
[20:40] because we touched the topic that we
[20:42] have to make platforms to reach those
[20:44] executive or uh executive uh SE level
[20:47] Executives better um how can we reach
[20:51] them better like what kind of formats do
[20:53] we need is is is that education for them
[20:56] already available in your mind or do do
[21:00] we need uh new programs or like what do
[21:03] you think we can reach the sea level
[21:04] Executives better there is information
[21:07] out there a lot but it's really it's
[21:09] scattered between some
[21:11] books between some papers from Black
[21:15] Rock Black Rock has a very nice six-page
[21:18] paper the rumor out there six page is
[21:21] like the white paper the same length
[21:24] number of pages there are some documents
[21:27] from fidelity
[21:30] but when we share them you and I it's
[21:33] not enough I think it's a good starting
[21:35] point but when a well respected business
[21:40] school or corporate governance
[21:43] institution even though it's not their
[21:45] job you know introduces this topic it
[21:47] would be extremely
[21:50] appreciated now there are some warten
[21:53] programs about blockchain in
[21:55] general but I think what's required is a
[21:58] Bitcoin course the first business school
[22:01] like inad or IMD because this is where
[22:05] Executives go I have been
[22:07] attending so many executive education
[22:10] courses the last 20 years I went to all
[22:13] the Business Schools almost in sead
[22:16] Stanford London Business School MIT for
[22:19] various courses and I learned a lot and
[22:23] that's where corporations are paying a
[22:25] lot of money to send their individuals
[22:27] there the executives there
[22:29] I think this is one way another way is
[22:31] to create a platform where somebody
[22:35] summarizes in a condensed easy way
[22:38] Bitcoin for Professionals for sea levels
[22:41] uh we we we're getting better and better
[22:44] in educating people but we have to more
[22:46] get get more targeted also with the the
[22:49] the group thinking the network effects
[22:50] are slowly slowly coming one thing with
[22:52] that uh what I was wondering you talked
[22:54] before with like we need one big
[22:57] Corporation to come into Bitcoin we have
[23:00] one which is kind of into Bitcoin with
[23:02] Tesla which is a huge
[23:05] corporation um but they only have 10,000
[23:09] Bitcoin they have the potential to just
[23:10] buy way more than just 10,000 Bitcoin
[23:14] which is a lot of Bitcoin but for Tesla
[23:15] not that much um why why do why is that
[23:20] not a bigger of an impact is that is it
[23:23] because e is too crazy do we need like
[23:26] an a meta or like an Amazon or an apple
[23:29] to to come into the game Tesla is
[23:31] holding Bitcoin you're right but they
[23:33] hardly ever talk about it and Elon
[23:37] himself hardly ever talks about Bitcoin
[23:40] he hardly ever post about it I don't
[23:42] know why and uh he's very different than
[23:47] Michael saor Michael strategy is very
[23:49] focused by thinking about increasing the
[23:54] number of Bitcoin per share while Tesla
[23:57] is just holding it on the balance sheet
[24:00] Tesla is a fantastic company it will be
[24:03] you know one of the major leaders and
[24:06] top performing stock the years to come
[24:09] however Tesla has I
[24:11] think not focused on bitcoin maybe they
[24:13] are focused on their core
[24:15] business but the day you see a well
[24:19] respected you know and also sometimes
[24:22] Tesla is considered like a oneman show
[24:24] with with Elon but when you see a well
[24:27] respected
[24:28] large magnificent 7even or other Blue
[24:32] Chip company in the US endorsing Bitcoin
[24:36] this will be like a wakeup call for many
[24:40] companies um it's it's a matter of time
[24:43] I
[24:44] think do you think you mention it the
[24:46] the number of Bitcoin per share is like
[24:49] this new kind of metric that comes with
[24:52] the Bitcoin corporations now where also
[24:54] Michael sa is talking about a Bitcoin
[24:56] yield do you think Bitcoin per share
[24:59] could be almost like earnings per share
[25:02] in in the future where it's a really
[25:04] important metric to to track I think I'm
[25:07] not sure about that to be honest because
[25:09] not all companies are as focused as
[25:12] Michael sailor and meta Planet are and
[25:16] those by the way are the best performing
[25:18] stocks in the US and Japan respectively
[25:21] in
[25:22] 2024 micro and meta Planet other
[25:26] companies other CEOs I know have Bitcoin
[25:29] on the balance sheet don't think along
[25:31] those lines they think I want to
[25:34] allocate x% of my cash to bitcoin and
[25:38] I'm building my Bitcoin reserves step by
[25:41] step um and it's very interesting that
[25:45] bitwise will be launching in March and
[25:48] ETF with a portfolio of companies
[25:51] holding Bitcoin on the balance
[25:53] sheet they're not talking about Bitcoin
[25:56] not about Bitcoin per share
[25:59] but they are talking only in general as
[26:01] Bitcoin on the balance sheet and another
[26:04] angle to convince some companies is to
[26:08] tell them guys there is so much
[26:10] disruption in today's world there is so
[26:13] much Innovation coming our way AI is a
[26:16] major game Cher there used to be monthly
[26:20] AI updates on latest news then weekly
[26:23] and today on a daily basis I tell them
[26:27] micro strategy was a very decent
[26:28] business until 2020 with very little
[26:32] growth and Michael sailor discovered
[26:35] Bitcoin and transformed the company and
[26:39] today history tells us what the results
[26:41] are so buying Bitcoin the balance she
[26:44] Robin can be a kind of insurance for
[26:47] some companies where they say there will
[26:50] be disruption coming
[26:52] up we don't know what the future will
[26:55] look like for us we are really
[26:57] challenged in our Core Business we are
[27:00] nervous about it if we buy some Bitcoin
[27:04] on a regular basis we start building a
[27:07] potential assets which can be very
[27:09] valuable in the future which and which
[27:11] can help us invest in other areas that's
[27:15] one angle of presenting this to
[27:19] organizations but again the challenge is
[27:23] many companies are in their comfort
[27:26] zone like no many like Kodak and
[27:31] Blockbuster and
[27:34] blackberry and very few maybe some not
[27:37] very few but some leaders are not that
[27:39] you know agile and willing to consider
[27:43] change and Innovation that's true yeah
[27:45] that's really interesting one aspect
[27:48] that I also think about uh you you just
[27:50] mentioned it in the beginning of of our
[27:53] talk was uh that there are so many
[27:55] talents in
[27:56] Bitcoin um like there's one thing of
[27:59] like sea levels uh kind of uh seeing
[28:02] Bitcoin but there's this another thing
[28:04] of like this cross roots movement where
[28:07] Bitcoin comes into the company with the
[28:10] talents and the uh the employees that
[28:12] come in the company is that something
[28:15] that maybe in the future where a company
[28:17] kind of has to um have a Bitcoin
[28:22] friendly uh setting because the there's
[28:25] there's a huge recruitment pool of
[28:28] bitcoiners out there that want to work
[28:30] but they only want to work for like
[28:32] Bitcoin friendly companies or even like
[28:34] Bitcoin companies that have offer maybe
[28:36] a part Bitcoin salary or bonuses in
[28:39] Bitcoin or have some other kind of
[28:41] programs uh or the or the employee knows
[28:44] okay the company is saving in Bitcoin
[28:47] and therefore is doing something good is
[28:49] that something that that you you looked
[28:51] into no I did not look into that for
[28:54] example the Dubai government now just
[28:56] authorized payment of salaries in
[28:59] Bitcoin but frankly I think this is an
[29:03] extra step not really necessary at this
[29:06] moment companies who want to really
[29:09] learn more about Bitcoin and they want
[29:12] to discover this asset they can do other
[29:15] you know their regular means of
[29:17] attractive packages working
[29:20] environment uh flexible you know working
[29:23] from home versus being in the office to
[29:25] really attract Talent
[29:28] um and by the way when you
[29:31] hire Bitcoin experts and people who
[29:35] understand Bitcoin those people will
[29:36] come and will start influencing the
[29:39] culture of the
[29:40] organizations but I would not go as far
[29:43] as saying I want to change the culture
[29:45] of the company and the way the company
[29:47] Embraces Bitcoin through salaries
[29:50] compensation and other benefits I think
[29:54] the first very simple step is very
[29:57] simple somehow get some Bitcoin the
[29:59] balance sheet track it monitor it do
[30:02] some DCA dollar cost averaging and then
[30:06] learn more about it as you
[30:08] go but you are right there is a lot of
[30:11] talent in the Bitcoin
[30:13] industry and uh it would be amazing if
[30:16] this Talent can spread and start joining
[30:20] some uh wellestablished Blue Chip
[30:24] companies to start triggering change ah
[30:28] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[30:31] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[30:34] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[30:37] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[30:39] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[30:43] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[30:46] go out there and show that you are a
[30:48] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:51] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[30:54] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:57] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:59] collections you have the date of the
[31:02] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:05] and of course also the block height and
[31:08] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[31:11] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:14] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:16] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:19] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:22] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:25] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:27] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[31:30] and now the most important step is to
[31:33] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[31:36] hardware wallet my personal
[31:37] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:39] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:42] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[31:44] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[31:47] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[31:51] with the code Robin at the checkout
[31:53] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[31:57] your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:59] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:02] individual you have to have the most
[32:04] secure self custody setup you have to
[32:07] secure your own devices you have to
[32:10] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:12] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:15] where you live you even want to have a
[32:17] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:20] in case something goes really really
[32:22] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:24] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:27] byep step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:29] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[32:33] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[32:36] how you can level up your sovereignty
[32:39] and then the Grassroots movement starts
[32:41] from like uh from within I fully agree
[32:45] with that really cool um how do you like
[32:48] when do you see this uh Bitcoin
[32:51] corporation uh adoption happening is it
[32:54] uh depending on who who's kind moving
[32:57] first is the big company that kind of
[33:00] get gets the first time into Bitcoin um
[33:04] when do you foresee that or what what
[33:05] events do you think needs to happen that
[33:08] we have those Bitcoin trigger events
[33:11] where we have in the adoption in in the
[33:14] corporate world also more and more
[33:16] adoption of like maybe now it's one S&P
[33:18] 500 company with Tesla that has uh um
[33:23] Bitcoin uh what has to happen that like
[33:25] 50% of the S&P 500 compan iies have have
[33:29] Bitcoin on the balance sheet I think
[33:30] today you see well established Blue Chip
[33:34] companies I would not sayate the
[33:36] percentage
[33:37] but an IBM or well or maybe a non- tech
[33:43] company embracing Bitcoin or a tech
[33:45] company one of the Mac Max magnificent 7
[33:48] embracing Bitcoin when you
[33:51] see a country or US state adopting
[33:55] Bitcoin as a strategic Reserve
[33:58] or when you see a country in the western
[34:01] world or in Asia a large
[34:04] country adopting Bitcoin and strategic
[34:06] Bitcoin Reserve this will trigger a wake
[34:08] up call and then at that moment many
[34:12] corporations will start you know
[34:14] wondering what do we do about it also
[34:18] when you start benchmarking the
[34:20] performance of your stock at your
[34:23] company versus others holding Bitcoin on
[34:27] the balance sheet
[34:28] this is I think to be a very interesting
[34:31] by end of 25 there will be the ETF from
[34:34] bitwise and I really look forward to
[34:37] comparing the performance of this
[34:39] ETF versus other ETFs and other
[34:44] companies because it's very difficult to
[34:47] compare to micro strategy because
[34:50] Michael sailor is so extreme with
[34:52] 460,000
[34:55] Bitcoins and people tell me this this is
[34:57] a unique case there is no other you know
[35:00] micel sailor around the world
[35:03] possible but when you see an ETF with
[35:05] many companies at the portfolio
[35:08] performing so much better questions will
[35:10] be asked this will take I think it's a
[35:12] five to 10 year journey and the winners
[35:16] will be those who embrace the strategy
[35:19] first and I say to companies and to
[35:22] boards guys start with baby steps no
[35:26] need to rush just just be
[35:29] curious and one of the most important
[35:32] skill
[35:33] today is intellectual
[35:35] curiosity for people at BO levels there
[35:38] is so much change happening there is so
[35:40] much
[35:41] Innovation it's very tough to stay
[35:43] relevant in the room with all this
[35:45] Innovation happening around you I spent
[35:47] so much time myself learning about AI
[35:51] longevity well-being latest corporate
[35:54] governance development about Bitcoin
[35:58] I love learning myself you know
[35:59] personally and I encourage others to
[36:02] really learn in today's
[36:05] world getting out of University with a
[36:08] degree is not at all sufficient to stay
[36:14] up to speed with all the change
[36:16] happening around us and the great
[36:18] University by the way is YouTube you can
[36:21] learn so much on YouTube If you select
[36:23] the right channel but do invest time in
[36:26] your personal development
[36:28] there are some great investment one
[36:30] great investment is Bitcoin another
[36:33] investment is your own personal
[36:36] development and try to influence people
[36:38] around you would be surprised I think
[36:41] things can go much faster than we
[36:43] think we sometimes
[36:46] overestimate what can be done in one
[36:48] year and underestimate what can happen
[36:50] in five years absolutely it's it's kind
[36:53] of crazy also for me to think back
[36:54] because uh almost 5 years ago I came
[36:57] into Bitcoin like four and a half years
[36:58] ago and just thinking back how different
[37:01] the Bitcoin world was 5 years ago to now
[37:05] it's crazy how far we have come and then
[37:07] uh seeing that exponential growth curve
[37:10] till like
[37:11] 2030 that's uh that that that seems to
[37:15] be uh yeah it's hard to imagine what
[37:18] what can happen in that that time frame
[37:20] especially if you have so many amazing
[37:22] example with micro strategy and meta
[37:24] planet and other companies uh that just
[37:27] like have such successful uh stories
[37:31] CFOs CEOs all around the world have to
[37:36] look at this and say oh what are they
[37:38] doing like micro strategy what business
[37:41] model do they have oh this business
[37:43] model how can this business model have
[37:45] such an amazing stock performance oh
[37:47] it's because of Bitcoin oh maybe we
[37:49] should look into this so it will be hard
[37:52] and harder to ignore the longer it goes
[37:55] on and the more successfully goes on so
[37:59] I'm I'm really bullish on on next few
[38:02] years it will be it it be a golden
[38:05] window of opportunity I think for for
[38:07] corporations also you're 100% right who
[38:10] would have said just a year ago that the
[38:13] next US president will be supporting
[38:17] Bitcoin so much or that the US
[38:19] Administration will be so much Pro
[38:21] Bitcoin when when the
[38:24] ETFs were started on Jane 11 24 try to
[38:29] remember the Bloomberg forecast and
[38:31] others forecast the forecast where 50%
[38:35] of what was achieved nobody thought we
[38:38] will be where we are today you know and
[38:40] maybe what helped me personally is my
[38:43] experience with Red Bull over 12 years
[38:46] Robin when I started in
[38:48] 1998 I don't even imagine how old you
[38:50] were at that time 1998 you were very
[38:54] very extremely young if born at all and
[38:57] then there was so much
[38:59] skepticism and so much worry about
[39:01] energy drinks how safe the products are
[39:04] what are the ingredients what the story
[39:07] in does Red Bull or energy drinks do
[39:10] they kill people and so on so forth and
[39:12] having lived this the birth and the
[39:16] establishment of a major new beverage
[39:19] category of energy drinks which are
[39:21] today mainstream but this was not the
[39:24] case in 1998 and I saw it over over my
[39:27] 12E
[39:29] career this did really help me to
[39:33] understand and be patient with Bitcoin
[39:36] the last five years so people have to be
[39:39] patient people have to do their homework
[39:43] and have some Vision to imagine what
[39:46] Bitcoin can do and every time in the
[39:48] history when a technology was introduced
[39:52] there were many skeptical people like
[39:53] when electricity came in when the first
[39:56] car was introduced uced there was so
[39:58] much you know fighting from the horse
[40:01] and carriage industry when the first
[40:03] airplane was introduced and so on so
[40:05] forth so we will be here in five years
[40:09] looking at you remember
[40:11] 2024 how small the adoption was and
[40:16] where we are that's amazing yeah wow and
[40:20] I and I like also by the way 1998 is
[40:24] actually my birth
[40:25] year you it right on like 1998 uh 9 9th
[40:31] of September 1998 is my birth uh date
[40:35] exactly uh and uh Red Bull obviously
[40:38] people know I'm from Austria Red Bull is
[40:40] also an an Austrian company uh so I I I
[40:45] know the company of course and uh the
[40:48] headquarters is also not that far away
[40:49] from my my home uh back in in Lind uh so
[40:54] yeah it's it's a great company uh all
[40:58] it's interesting I think we we can learn
[40:59] a lot from from that what what could we
[41:02] learn from from Red Bull overall as
[41:05] youve been with the company for quite
[41:06] some time uh that we could might use in
[41:10] in Bitcoin in the Bitcoin ecosystem was
[41:12] a fantastic company I was really you
[41:14] know blessed and honored to having work
[41:17] there in Europe and then running Asia
[41:19] and then running the US and today people
[41:22] look at the success of Red Bull major
[41:25] success story but I can tell you
[41:27] it was a huge you know adventure and
[41:31] risk and dedication and hard work from
[41:36] the founder di mesit rest in peace you
[41:41] know um amazing Visionary who had really
[41:45] extremely tough time to launch an energy
[41:48] an energy drink in 1987 in
[41:51] Europe and uh I can tell you the
[41:55] challenges the company fac based at the
[41:57] beginning and the
[41:59] skepticism and the fights was regulatory
[42:03] authorities with the large beverage
[42:06] companies with
[42:08] distribution are were were very very
[42:11] significant and the company made it and
[42:13] I'm very proud to having been part of
[42:15] that team it's a fantastic team at Red
[42:18] Bull which explained the result and I
[42:20] think when I look at the talent at
[42:23] Bitcoin
[42:25] conferences and uh
[42:28] the smart people and the dedication of
[42:30] the people who are there I'm very
[42:32] optimistic about the future and I say to
[42:34] my friends redb gave me wings and also
[42:37] Bitcoin can give you wings Bitcoin can
[42:40] give you wings in a way it can support
[42:42] your Financial Freedom in the future
[42:45] and yeah 100% And when I by the way when
[42:51] people look at Red Bull they think it's
[42:52] a bunch of young people or just you know
[42:57] junior staff and this was my also my
[43:00] expectation from Bitcoin people but I
[43:03] was impressed by the white hair at the
[43:05] Bitcoin conferences I always call it
[43:07] white hair experienced people and the
[43:09] same thing is at Red Bull you have a lot
[43:11] of very senior experienced people who
[43:15] supported leading the company to where
[43:17] it is today and I'm confident when I
[43:20] meet the talent at the Bitcoin
[43:23] conferences they will be able to address
[43:26] the challenges and the risks we hear
[43:29] that there are two risks for Bitcoin in
[43:30] the
[43:31] future will Bitcoin remain secure will
[43:35] Bitcoin remain
[43:37] decentralized those are the two
[43:39] potential
[43:40] risk um I'm not an expert on the answers
[43:45] I did a lot of homework I researched it
[43:48] but I think it would be good that we
[43:51] discuss more about those potential risks
[43:53] to reassure people about Bitcoin
[43:58] but I trust the system I trust the
[44:01] developers and the organizations I don't
[44:04] know if you have an opinion on those
[44:06] risks Robin I I I do think that that
[44:09] Bitcoin will work out on on some of the
[44:12] the uh scalability issues that we might
[44:16] face on some of the risks that come from
[44:19] the software so I do think that we come
[44:21] to that also interesting input from the
[44:24] age I was also really surprised because
[44:26] I thought when I into Bitcoin there will
[44:28] be a lot of bitcoiners like my age I'm
[44:31] 26 years old now and uh having a Bitcoin
[44:34] Channel right now uh and I run my own
[44:38] Bitcoin Channel with with this here and
[44:40] I'm 26 years old I see the audience
[44:43] statistics and audience statistics tells
[44:45] me one thing there are more people
[44:48] listening to this uh podcast above 45
[44:52] years old then under 45 years old so
[44:56] it's like 55 % above 45 years old and 45
[45:00] under uh which is kind of amazing for me
[45:03] that the audience uh for Bitcoin
[45:06] podcasts is so uh so much more mature
[45:10] than I thought it is and I think that
[45:13] also represents when you go to a bit big
[45:16] Bitcoin conference uh of course there
[45:18] young people there but uh the majority
[45:21] of the people are actually quite
[45:23] experienced and already uh way more sure
[45:27] than than than I thought of and
[45:29] apparently also you thought of uh so I
[45:32] think that's really something uh um
[45:35] bullish to look like because I I
[45:37] sometimes hear like oh Bitcoin is so for
[45:39] like young people and like it's it's a
[45:41] young thing of like no if you actually
[45:44] look at the industry um it's a it's a
[45:46] grownup industry it's it's something uh
[45:49] where a lot of uh experienced people
[45:52] with a lot of life experience also uh
[45:55] come in here and
[45:57] uh put their skills and their uh yeah
[46:00] life experiences into this industry and
[46:02] and it it shows yeah Bitcoin is amazing
[46:06] and then we have the other side with the
[46:07] cryptos with altcoins and mem coins
[46:10] there is where I think a lot of the
[46:12] younger people are uh but the Bitcoin
[46:15] only crowd the Bitcoin uh Focus crowd
[46:18] especially I think that's a whole
[46:20] different uh game and it's also great to
[46:22] see that that that you have seen that
[46:25] and that you see kind of that
[46:27] development in Bitcoin I love that 100%
[46:31] 100% And I have to say you know I really
[46:33] love your podcast because you always
[46:36] bring a different person and it's very
[46:39] impressive the energy you spend on doing
[46:42] those
[46:43] interviews and by listening to the
[46:46] perspective of the different experts you
[46:48] bring like a teacher or an investor or
[46:53] whatever you know I always learn
[46:55] something new the format of your
[46:58] interview is very interesting it's quite
[47:00] long it's one hour but the beauty is
[47:02] there is always a new angle while with
[47:05] other podcasts it's very often the same
[47:07] people coming in and it gets a bit maybe
[47:11] boring and we we are used to what those
[47:13] people are saying so congratulations for
[47:16] really standing out and for the
[47:18] dedication of doing a daily interview
[47:21] know thank you so much yeah it's it's
[47:24] it's been a it's a it's been a great
[47:26] ride already and and I love it and every
[47:29] day I actually love it a little bit more
[47:32] uh and it gets also easier it's so
[47:35] second nature now to talk with uh most
[47:38] of my guests like it's actually rare in
[47:41] our instance where I already met you
[47:44] before we recorded that's really rare
[47:47] actually like 90% of my guests I never
[47:49] spoke to uh in real life or uh online
[47:54] before I jump into the conversation
[47:57] uh because we reached out like on on
[47:59] Twitter or we we some guest is
[48:01] recommending another guest and then we
[48:04] just set it up and say like oh let's
[48:06] let's talk and then we talk usually two
[48:08] three minutes as we did before the
[48:09] recording and then we record and so I
[48:12] have all every day a a new conversation
[48:15] with a new
[48:17] stranger yeah it's extremely rich well
[48:20] done
[48:21] Robin thank thank you so much uh and one
[48:24] more thing or maybe two more things that
[48:26] I want to get into the podcast is um
[48:29] especially for someone uh that is uh
[48:34] like I currently don't really look at
[48:37] Bitcoin for retirement because
[48:39] retirement is for me
[48:40] like feels like so so long away um um
[48:45] but you also brought that angle in like
[48:47] how do you see it uh to bitcoin for
[48:50] retirement Bitcoin as an asset for your
[48:53] uh retirement in 5 10 20 30 years um
[48:58] when it's coming a little bit closer how
[49:01] do you look at that what got me into
[49:04] Bitcoin is me thinking already since
[49:06] couple of years about how will I
[49:09] maintain my standard of living and live
[49:13] well during my
[49:15] retirement and I don't believe we can
[49:17] really rely on the social security
[49:19] system which we have in Europe with uh
[49:22] populations aging and less young people
[49:26] coming in
[49:27] birth rates are extremely low I think
[49:30] sooner or later there will be a problem
[49:32] with Social Security contributions and I
[49:34] kept on thinking maybe it's about long
[49:38] term how can we know maintain our
[49:41] standard of
[49:43] living and having discovered Bitcoin I
[49:46] was lucky and really we are very all of
[49:49] us should be very thankful for what uh
[49:54] Satoshi did uh with the creation of
[49:58] Bitcoin and I have a model where I look
[50:01] at the Bitcoin I have and I have my
[50:03] simulation on the performance potential
[50:06] performance of Bitcoin over the years
[50:09] and thinking how can we live out of the
[50:12] Bitcoin Holdings we have of course one
[50:15] should not assume the 45% ker
[50:18] performance the last 15 years or even
[50:21] the 60% performance the last four years
[50:25] you take a much lower
[50:28] ker 15% assume over the next 40 50 years
[50:34] and you can see what you can take there
[50:37] are two ways either you spend your
[50:39] Bitcoins or you can borrow against your
[50:42] Bitcoin and most of the wealthy people
[50:45] high net worth individuals I'm not one
[50:47] by the way historically have lived by
[50:51] borrowing against their
[50:53] assets a lot of banks are working on
[50:56] offering now Now Products where we can
[50:59] borrow against our Bitcoins it's the
[51:03] very beginning of this industry uh it's
[51:06] something to look at in the future but
[51:09] otherwise you make a simulation how many
[51:12] Bitcoins you have how many you will
[51:14] acquire the next couple of years when
[51:17] you retire and how you can live out of
[51:19] that but once you get into the Bitcoin
[51:22] mindset I think your spending Behavior
[51:26] changes and you start thinking how can I
[51:28] accumulate more Bitcoin I don't know if
[51:31] that's happening with eurobin but I see
[51:33] it with many
[51:34] bitcoiners I want to have a decent life
[51:37] I want to enjoy I want to travel and so
[51:39] on so forth but also I want to maximize
[51:42] the Bitcoins I have and once you start
[51:44] being confident and you taste the
[51:46] performance of
[51:48] Bitcoin in your portfolio it's it should
[51:51] be the best performing
[51:52] asset you start wanting to maximize your
[51:56] Holdings of Bitcoin I know some high
[51:58] networks individuals who are really
[52:00] Bitcoin
[52:01] maximalist even a very well famous one
[52:04] I'm sure you know him he just sold his
[52:07] house a year ago and he had a big
[52:09] argument with his wife 18 months ago he
[52:12] sold bit he sold the house to buy
[52:15] Bitcoin he did extremely well obviously
[52:18] with a 120% performance in
[52:21] 2024 I'm not saying we should do that
[52:24] but we should all think about
[52:27] accumulating more Bitcoins and the best
[52:29] strategy is do it on a regular basis DCA
[52:33] and I'm coaching my kids by the way to
[52:36] save in Bitcoin instead of doing the S&P
[52:39] 500 or triple Q which are great ways by
[52:42] the way of savings but I think in
[52:44] today's world my kids are I told them
[52:48] you have
[52:49] to spend less than you earn they earn
[52:52] what I send them every month because I
[52:54] are studying at University and they have
[52:57] to spend less and save some money and
[52:58] they allocating to to bitcoin on a
[53:01] monthly basis especially with uh small
[53:04] kids actually uh I don't know how it's
[53:06] in America but in Austria you cannot
[53:08] open a bank account or especially not a
[53:11] stock account before the age of 18 uh I
[53:14] think you always need the parents for
[53:16] that maybe there's some special thing
[53:18] with 16 years old uh but if you want to
[53:21] send your 12y old uh money uh Bitcoin is
[53:26] kind the only way to do it because they
[53:28] can have a bank account but uh not
[53:31] really not a full one uh definitely not
[53:33] a stock account especially in Austria I
[53:35] don't know how it's all over the world
[53:37] but I also don't think that 12 FS can
[53:40] can have stock accounts on their own
[53:42] name uh but you can have a bit Bitcoin
[53:44] account so that that's also an
[53:47] interesting aspect of uh of it and I
[53:50] know a lot of Bitcoin parents that give
[53:53] their uh kids uh no matter if they are
[53:55] like two years old old or 5 years old or
[53:58] 12 years old or 18 years old they give
[54:00] the pocket money in Bitcoin in Satoshi
[54:02] in in either onchain or lightning
[54:05] wallets and I I think that's a great way
[54:07] to to teach the kid uh the kids already
[54:10] about about money and saving and and and
[54:13] see that that happening out that's
[54:15] that's a it's really beautiful and one
[54:18] thing is also interesting with you just
[54:20] thought about that uh you see in America
[54:23] currently the street Bitcoin Reserve
[54:25] topic uh coming up and up again um with
[54:30] you being you were in Austria in Europe
[54:33] you were in America Asia you were you're
[54:36] right now in Dubai um what do you see as
[54:39] the global Game Theory currently uh
[54:42] going on uh it's it's some guests
[54:46] described it to me almost like a Bitcoin
[54:48] Cold War where uh the different sides of
[54:52] the uh of the nation states kind of just
[54:54] wait till the first one buys and then
[54:57] they they move also and it's kind of
[54:59] like this this silence before a storm
[55:01] potentially are the president of Russia
[55:04] Today Robin and you are buying Bitcoin
[55:07] would you announce it to the world so I
[55:09] think I think many governments are today
[55:12] buying
[55:14] Bitcoin um I don't want to say the
[55:17] majority but many of them in Asia in the
[55:19] Middle East Russia is buying the Chinese
[55:22] are buying and nobody is announcing it
[55:25] because you don't want to start having
[55:28] as you mentioned a cold war or a race
[55:30] and a very huge price Peak and therefore
[55:35] I wonder if the US government will
[55:37] announce will announce Bitcoin as a
[55:38] strategic Bitcoin
[55:40] Reserve or they would rather start
[55:43] accumulating behind the scene and
[55:45] announcing it later on maybe from
[55:48] Regulatory and legal way they have to
[55:51] announce
[55:52] it and now we see what's happening with
[55:54] the states but sooner or later
[55:57] government will start racing and
[56:00] accumulating their Bitcoin Holdings this
[56:03] is but it's happening as we speak there
[56:05] are rumors that the UAE government is
[56:07] holding 300,000
[56:10] Bitcoins it can be possible the UAE
[56:13] government is really so Innovative so
[56:15] much ahead of the game they had an AI
[56:18] minister in the UAE seven years ago a
[56:21] minister of AI so much ahead of the game
[56:25] so I would not be surprised if the uee
[56:27] is already accumulating
[56:30] Marathon digital is having a JV in the U
[56:35] with the government uh mining Bitcoin
[56:38] and they are doing the same thing I
[56:39] think in other Gulf countries so to
[56:42] answer your questions many governments
[56:44] are doing it most of them are not saying
[56:47] it and it will come to life over the
[56:51] coming uh years definitely I love that I
[56:56] think uh I think so too um really cool
[56:58] we have one question that I ask each and
[57:00] every one of my guests uh uh towards the
[57:03] end of the podcast uh and it's super
[57:05] interesting to hear maybe what we can
[57:07] learn from you as a as a CEO of big
[57:10] companies um and the question is what
[57:13] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[57:16] I'm extremely passionate about corporate
[57:19] governance and effectiveness of
[57:22] nonexecutive independent board directors
[57:27] on companies which are familyowned or
[57:29] private Equity bagged or publicly listed
[57:32] companies this is why I spend most of my
[57:35] energy and my time how can we as board
[57:40] directors add value in the Board Room
[57:43] how can we advise CEOs how can we
[57:47] develop the art of asking questions I
[57:50] think as a CEO you're really skilled at
[57:54] getting things done at executing
[57:56] and of course defining the strategy as a
[57:58] board member you should develop the art
[58:01] of asking questions because CEOs don't
[58:04] want to hear from you Robin what you
[58:07] tell them to do CEOs will be inspired by
[58:12] the questions you ask to make them think
[58:16] to make them think about things they did
[58:18] not think about to challenge them
[58:20] through your thinking and being in the
[58:23] boardroom of a familyowned business is
[58:26] very different than being in a boardroom
[58:28] of a private Equity back company just to
[58:31] take those two examples when you're in
[58:33] private Equity backed entity private
[58:36] Equity is all about financials kpis
[58:39] turnaround grow
[58:42] results familyowned business is about
[58:46] the family Legacy the family goals the
[58:50] developing the generation managing
[58:54] potential conflict between different
[58:56] members and so on so forth so as a board
[58:59] member you really have to develop this
[59:02] skill and this ability of adapting your
[59:04] style depending of on the shareholding
[59:09] that's really my passion and that's what
[59:12] I love talking
[59:13] about I love that yeah maybe we can make
[59:16] a second round around that one day could
[59:20] be interesting also for the audience
[59:21] perfect and thank you so much uh Sim uh
[59:24] for for being on the show before uh I
[59:27] let you go we have an end rtin in the
[59:28] podcast where the previous guest is
[59:30] asking a question uh for the next guest
[59:33] without knowing who the next guest
[59:34] actually is and your question from the
[59:37] previous guest is an interesting one
[59:39] it's almost impossible to answer but
[59:41] still would be interesting to hear your
[59:43] opinion which year will be the next
[59:47] Bitcoin soft Fork occur I hope
[59:50] never so uh there was a Bitcoin for Cor
[59:55] in in the
[59:57] past and I hope there will never be any
[60:00] more
[60:01] fork and this is a potential concern for
[60:04] many people what happens if there is a
[60:07] fork happening occurring and I think we
[60:11] will only have Bitcoin and in the past
[60:14] there were other folks like Bitcoin cash
[60:17] for example and
[60:18] others and all of them did not perform
[60:22] like Bitcoin did I hope we will only
[60:24] have Bitcoin and and that's it however
[60:28] what is really concerning
[60:31] potentially is the ETF paperwork of
[60:35] Black Rock when they write in the
[60:37] prospectus of the ETF if there is a fork
[60:40] happening they can decide I I don't know
[60:43] if you're aware of that black Ro can
[60:46] decide which Bitcoin to continue with
[60:51] because a fork means a different version
[60:53] of Bitcoin means
[60:56] the programmers have different opinions
[61:00] means a potential conflict I hope it
[61:02] will never happen yeah yeah um also just
[61:06] for the the listeners there's like
[61:08] different kinds of forks like there's
[61:10] hard and and soft Forks um so like I
[61:13] think like soft Forks is kind of like an
[61:15] upgrade to to bitcoin which is backwards
[61:18] compatible uh and uh yeah the hard folks
[61:21] are the ones that that as you mentioned
[61:23] the ones that uh we we hope I hope
[61:26] that's not happening uh at least not in
[61:29] a way as we had it in in 2017 with the
[61:32] pl size Wars I also do do hope so and
[61:36] yeah will be will be fun uh I think will
[61:39] be a lot of exciting um discussions
[61:43] coming our way Bitcoin is constantly
[61:45] attacked by a lot of actors and I hope
[61:48] blackr is not one of them uh but even if
[61:51] blackrook is one of them I I think we
[61:53] can I think Bitcoin showed that it has a
[61:56] lot of strength uh and can survive a lot
[61:58] of uh headwinds also and but yeah we
[62:02] will will could be a fun time the next
[62:05] five years to be in Bitcoin evolved uh
[62:07] entertaining and hopeful also
[62:09] successful in in that way just make a
[62:13] comment 100% agree with you black rock
[62:16] is here to make money and to maximize
[62:19] return for their shareholders my comment
[62:22] about the tax and the ETF perspectives
[62:25] was just I think a question which people
[62:28] are discussing about I believe is just
[62:31] legal wording which I can see in many
[62:33] prospectives of many companies to
[62:35] protect
[62:37] themselves I think it's Larry f is
[62:41] really an amazing person to be able to
[62:43] change his mind of where he was five
[62:44] years ago to where he is today Larry
[62:48] think has been the chief marketing
[62:50] officer of Bitcoin in
[62:53] 2024 he has endorsed it in such a big
[62:56] way and he is in the business of making
[63:00] money for the
[63:02] shareholders and not in the business of
[63:05] creating another Bitcoin or
[63:08] whatever so uh that's a good point yeah
[63:12] 100%
[63:14] 100% why you see other people like Jamie
[63:17] Diamond continuing until today of
[63:21] repeating the same thing at again and
[63:23] again and I say to people please watch
[63:26] what his company does not what he
[63:29] says his company is very much behind the
[63:32] industry while he is claiming Bitcoin is
[63:35] for drug dealers so watch what they do
[63:38] not what they say I'm a big believer in
[63:40] that like watch what they do and not not
[63:43] what they say it's the same thing for El
[63:45] musk by the way where he talks about
[63:48] Doge and not about Bitcoin but Tesla
[63:51] only bought Bitcoin uh and he also says
[63:54] himself actually in podcast that he owns
[63:58] uh way more Bitcoin than Doge uh so it's
[64:03] always like watch what they do and not
[64:04] what they say because what they can say
[64:07] anything but doing is the real proof of
[64:09] work and the the real action that they
[64:11] show and what they where they reveal
[64:14] what they actually uh do themselves and
[64:17] I think that's a that's a great Insight
[64:19] like watch what they do and uh not not
[64:21] what they say yeah thank you so much uh
[64:24] SIM for for being on before let you go
