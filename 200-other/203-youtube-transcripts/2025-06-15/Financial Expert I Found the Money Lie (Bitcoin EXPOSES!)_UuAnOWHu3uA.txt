[00:00] how much of the wealth management
[00:01] industry only exists because of an
[00:04] artificially created need to preserve
[00:07] wealth. There's a lot of what I and my
[00:09] colleagues do for a living that is only
[00:11] necessary because the currency bleeds
[00:13] value every year. I ordered the Bitcoin
[00:15] standard by Safety Amos and before I was
[00:18] even done with that book, uh I had
[00:20] realized that I was missing something
[00:21] here. I need to take a closer look at
[00:23] this. It makes wealth management
[00:25] services optional for a lot of wealthy
[00:28] people. There's really two ways you can
[00:30] acquire more Bitcoin. You can either try
[00:32] to speculate on non- Bitcoin assets you
[00:34] think will perform more in order to
[00:36] increase Bitcoin holdings, and that's
[00:38] what a lot of crypto traders do, or you
[00:41] can focus on Bitcoin as a savings
[00:42] vehicle and get to work providing some
[00:45] valuable service or product to your
[00:47] fellow man in order to earn money to
[00:49] acquire more Bitcoin. A lot of the
[00:51] demand for my services are artificially
[00:53] induced by the current monetary system
[00:55] and Bitcoin as a solution to that
[00:57] problem in the monetary system is also a
[01:00] threat to my
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] industry. Let's get started today with
[01:07] uh the intersection between Bitcoin
[01:10] traditional finance and yeah wealth
[01:12] management in in in general. Um, but
[01:15] before we get started with that, give us
[01:17] kind of an overview of what are you
[01:19] doing in or for Bitcoin. Sure. So, uh,
[01:23] my name is Matt Goller. I'm a financial
[01:25] adviser here in Richmond, Indiana. And
[01:27] as it relates to Bitcoin, what we're
[01:30] really focused on is the application of
[01:32] Bitcoin in traditional wealth management
[01:35] in order to enhance client outcomes. So
[01:38] that includes everything from the
[01:39] adoption of Bitcoin as a savings tool to
[01:42] the inclusion of Bitcoin in a
[01:44] diversified portfolio. So we're now able
[01:48] to educate clients about Bitcoin and to
[01:50] offer it in a variety of ways. And
[01:52] that's really the big focus alongside
[01:55] all the traditional asset management,
[01:57] wealth management services that we offer
[01:59] is including Bitcoin wherever we think
[02:02] that it makes sense for clients. I like
[02:05] that. putting putting Bitcoin where
[02:07] where it fits best. Um what is the we
[02:11] talk a lot about the traditional
[02:13] financial space and and and how it's
[02:15] moving slowly slowly to to to Bitcoin.
[02:19] um how do you see the traditional
[02:21] financial space and and and how they
[02:24] look at Bitcoin versus the in bitcoin
[02:28] industry so like the bitcoiners itself
[02:30] look at industry and the the difference
[02:33] between those two uh very distinct views
[02:36] I would say the two still view each
[02:39] other broadly with a sense of skepticism
[02:42] so u thoroughly orange pill bitcoiners
[02:45] still view my industry with some
[02:47] skepticism
[02:48] Um, there's a lot of Bitcoiners where
[02:50] their philosophy is huddle 100% of your
[02:53] wealth in self-custody Bitcoin. And for
[02:57] those Bitcoiners, I don't hate that
[02:59] idea. I think in fact that will give
[03:01] them a good result over time as long as
[03:03] they're able to withstand the volatility
[03:05] and never become a forced seller of
[03:08] Bitcoin. for traditional finance the
[03:11] we've seen some progress over the last
[03:14] four or five years where I think the
[03:16] narrative has shifted from Bitcoin being
[03:18] some fringe financial experiment to more
[03:22] of an established asset class. The uh
[03:25] spot ETFs I think had a lot to do with
[03:28] that when you saw large mainstream
[03:30] financial companies come out with you
[03:32] know Bitcoin white papers and research
[03:34] products and things like that. But the
[03:37] progress is moving slowly. And so I
[03:41] would say most of my colleagues still
[03:43] view Bitcoin. Uh they conceptually lump
[03:46] it in with the broader crypto industry
[03:49] and justifiably somewhat dismiss it as a
[03:52] speculative bubble. You know, something
[03:54] with no actual value. But over time,
[03:57] more and more of them, I think, are
[03:58] coming to the realization that among all
[04:01] the things that are going on in crypto
[04:04] land, there actually is something there
[04:06] worth paying attention, and that thing
[04:07] is called Bitcoin.
[04:09] Why Why do you think um they they still
[04:13] make the the basket assumption of
[04:16] Bitcoin and crypto, not Bitcoin, or like
[04:18] there's like a line between them and and
[04:21] how how do you think we can overcome
[04:23] that? uh few of threadify looking at
[04:27] Bitcoin the same way they look at I
[04:29] don't know Solano or anything like that.
[04:31] I think the main reason is that the
[04:32] crypto industry has done a good job of
[04:34] marketing and uh you know orangewashing
[04:38] their project as if it is something of
[04:41] the same kind as Bitcoin and I think
[04:44] that's purposeful where when they launch
[04:46] an al altcoin or you know a crypto token
[04:48] or a crypto project um largely they try
[04:52] to ride on the coattails of Bitcoin and
[04:54] you know this is Bitcoin except it has
[04:57] XYZ functionality or this is Bitcoin
[04:59] except it has this improvement. So, you
[05:03] know, it's hard to get into the minds of
[05:05] some of my colleagues, but thinking back
[05:07] to what I used to think back in 2017,
[05:11] that's what I believed. Um, that's when
[05:13] Bitcoin first got on my radar because of
[05:15] the price run up that year. And I'm not
[05:18] proud of it, but at the time I told
[05:20] clients that Bitcoin was digital beanie
[05:22] Babies. Um, speculative bubble, no
[05:24] actual value, not a suitable long-term
[05:27] investment or store of value. And the
[05:30] reason I thought that is because when I
[05:32] tried to look into it, you know, that's
[05:35] when the ICO boom was happening and
[05:38] blockchain, blockchain, blockchain was
[05:39] just a buzzword you heard everywhere.
[05:41] And I I just could not see through all
[05:43] of that to see that Bitcoin was a true
[05:48] profound innovation. So what's the
[05:51] solution to that? I think the solution
[05:53] is number one. I think it's improving on
[05:56] its own already. But in order to
[05:58] accelerate it, I think what I try to do
[06:01] is focus on what makes Bitcoin unique
[06:03] among crypto assets, which is that it's
[06:06] an asset without an issuer and that it
[06:09] is a form of digital money that supply
[06:11] is enforced by the unfable expenditure
[06:14] of real world energy. So, and that
[06:17] proofof work consensus along with a few
[06:20] other components that was the true
[06:22] innovation. Alternative crypto tokens
[06:25] uninvented Bitcoin's innovation by
[06:28] reinserting a trusted intermediary and
[06:31] by getting rid of the energy component
[06:36] and try to pretend that that makes it a
[06:38] more efficient version of Bitcoin. But
[06:40] all they've really done is recreated the
[06:42] traditional financial system and window
[06:45] dressed it with cryptonomenclature.
[06:48] How did you uh this finally saw that? I
[06:52] I I imagine like a lot of people have
[06:54] problems with like first calling
[06:56] something uh something digital beanie
[06:59] babies and then basically calling it
[07:01] trash and then coming to the realization
[07:03] or like I was wrong and and and uh
[07:06] there's a lot of ego death involved uh
[07:09] in that like most Bitcoiners go through
[07:11] that. Uh how how how was that for you?
[07:15] How did you come to that? Was there like
[07:16] some some kind of aha moment or like
[07:18] it's just over time you you saw it it's
[07:20] not going away? I was fortunate in the
[07:24] sense that I was already ideologically
[07:26] primed to embrace Bitcoin. Like I tell I
[07:29] read the creature from Jackal Island
[07:31] when I was 19 years old, freshman or
[07:33] sophomore in college and I did I studied
[07:36] a lot of Austrian economics on my own in
[07:38] college. So that theory of money, the
[07:42] underlying theory of value that Bitcoin
[07:44] proposes, I was good there. Um what what
[07:49] became the light bulb moment for me was
[07:51] in 2020 where that's where I joined
[07:55] Vista Investment Partners, my current
[07:56] firm. And my first day was March 23rd of
[08:00] 2020, which was the day that Indiana's
[08:03] governor announced the shutdown for the
[08:04] pandemic. So, new job, uh, weren't
[08:09] having in-person client meetings. I
[08:11] didn't, you know, I had some time on my
[08:12] hands and, you know, we were printing
[08:15] trillions of dollars. And something made
[08:17] me notice that Bitcoin, this Bitcoin
[08:19] thing wasn't dead yet. And I decided
[08:23] that if I'm going to continue dismissing
[08:25] this, I need to at least understand it.
[08:27] I need to at least read a book about it.
[08:29] So, I ordered the Bitcoin Standard by
[08:32] Safety Dynamos. And before I was even
[08:35] done with that book, uh, I had realized
[08:38] that I was missing something here. I
[08:39] need to take a closer look at this. And
[08:42] finished one book that led to a second
[08:44] book and then fell down the proverbial
[08:46] Bitcoin rabbit hole and obsessively
[08:49] began reading every book I could find,
[08:51] listening to every podcast I could
[08:52] listen to and u just started coming to
[08:57] the realization that someone actually
[08:59] did it. Someone actually solved the
[09:00] biggest problem in global finance over
[09:02] the last century. That person was
[09:04] Satoshi Nakamoto and he solved it with
[09:06] Bitcoin.
[09:08] I love that that that rabbit hole. It's
[09:11] it always gives me like almost
[09:13] goosebumps when I when I hear those
[09:14] rabbit hole stories. Uh even though I
[09:16] heard it so many times. Uh it's quite
[09:19] fascinating. Is there something that
[09:21] you've learned just as a quick side
[09:23] trick? Is this something that you learn
[09:25] through Bitcoin through the Bitcoin
[09:27] rabbit hole? That was kind of um unc
[09:30] untraditional like something that like
[09:32] oh like I didn't expect to to learn
[09:34] about that with with the Bitcoin rabbit
[09:37] hole. One thing related to my industry
[09:40] is how much of the wealth management
[09:42] industry only exists because of an
[09:45] artificially created need to preserve
[09:47] wealth. And what I mean by that is
[09:50] there's a lot of what I and my
[09:52] colleagues do for a living that is only
[09:54] necessary because the currency bleeds
[09:56] value every year where it and so that
[09:59] that's related to how over the last
[10:01] especially the last 50 years the act of
[10:04] saving and the act of investing have
[10:06] become conflated almost as if they're
[10:09] the same thing when functionally they
[10:11] are very very different things where the
[10:14] act of saving is to not do anything with
[10:18] money except keep it safe, to withhold
[10:21] spending. The act of investing is to
[10:24] deploy money at risk in order to empower
[10:27] productive economic work and generate a
[10:29] return on that money. Not only are those
[10:31] two different things, but in some ways
[10:33] those are opposite things. But because
[10:35] of the devaluation of fiat currency,
[10:37] over time intuitively people just
[10:40] started understanding that if you want
[10:42] to save money for the long term, you
[10:44] have to do something with it.
[10:47] And that was something I'd never really
[10:50] considered um even given my um my
[10:54] background and some of my economic
[10:56] interests and things that I'd read. And
[10:57] even though that's what I've been doing
[10:59] for a living since college, that was a
[11:01] big light bulb moment where I realized
[11:03] that um a lot of the demand for my
[11:06] services are artificially induced by the
[11:09] current monetary system. and Bitcoin as
[11:11] a solution to that problem in the
[11:13] monetary system is also a threat to my
[11:15] industry. So that's a point I try to
[11:19] drive home to other financial advisors
[11:21] is that Bitcoin is not just some new
[11:24] interesting asset that you can offer. It
[11:26] is your competitor and if you continue
[11:29] ignoring it, it will eventually disrupt
[11:31] your business. So that that was
[11:34] definitely something new that I learned
[11:35] in the Bitcoin rabbit hole. That's
[11:38] interesting. I
[11:40] uh never heard basically um a financial
[11:44] advisor like a wealth manager in that
[11:47] regard saying that Bitcoin is a threat
[11:49] to um uh that industry. I heard some of
[11:53] them say it will completely reform that.
[11:57] Um but is that whole section of
[12:00] financial
[12:01] advising basically at at risk because of
[12:05] Bitcoin?
[12:06] Yeah, and it's also an opportunity. You
[12:09] know, I I don't think that the industry
[12:12] of wealth management is going to go away
[12:14] anytime soon, but there are parts of it
[12:17] that Bitcoin will dematerialize and
[12:19] replace. And similar to, you know, any
[12:22] other industry that we've seen with
[12:23] automation where the uh the adoption of
[12:27] the tractor and the combine did not
[12:28] eliminate the vocation of farming, but
[12:32] it made it so that one farmer could
[12:35] produce much more than you could before
[12:37] the adoption of that technology. And
[12:40] with Bitcoin, there's something similar
[12:42] where it makes wealth management
[12:45] services optional for a lot of wealthy
[12:48] people where whereas now a lot of people
[12:52] unless they are inclined to manage their
[12:55] own wealth and study the stock market,
[12:57] study investments, manage their own
[12:58] portfolio. Some people like to do that,
[13:01] some people are good at doing that. But
[13:02] a lot of people don't. And there are a
[13:05] lot of wealthy people who just want to
[13:06] keep their money. And if they don't want
[13:09] to take on a second part-time job to
[13:11] keep it, then they have to hire
[13:12] professionals like me to go out into the
[13:15] complexities of the financial universe
[13:17] and help them navigate that realm. And
[13:20] so that's the part the the default need
[13:24] I think that's going away. And the
[13:26] opportunity for financial advisors is to
[13:29] discover in that world how they can
[13:31] still add value to those clients where
[13:34] if someone becomes a client, it's not
[13:36] because they need a financial advisor.
[13:38] It's because I and my firm can offer
[13:41] them some value that they can't
[13:42] otherwise get just hodddling Bitcoin.
[13:45] That's something I I I see that all the
[13:48] time when I I meet young people,
[13:50] especially younger people, uh that are
[13:52] like 25 and younger.
[13:55] a little bit younger than me. Um, I see
[13:57] them sometimes really trying to to the
[14:01] game, the stock market to to try to find
[14:04] alcoin that will outperform Bitcoin. Uh,
[14:07] some already aware of like I want to get
[14:09] more Bitcoin, but they they're trying to
[14:12] be fancy with altcoins and trading and
[14:14] stuff like that. And and for me, that
[14:16] goes a little bit uh next to like it's
[14:20] it's it's going against what Bitcoin
[14:22] actually stands for. And Bitcoin really
[14:26] gives you the clarity and the focus on
[14:28] on what's important. I since now almost
[14:32] four years am exclusively on Bitcoin and
[14:35] the clarity and the focus from that is
[14:38] amazing because I just save what I don't
[14:41] need for life in Bitcoin. So every month
[14:43] there's a set amount of of of money that
[14:46] just goes to Bitcoin. the other set of
[14:48] money I use. And this allows me to not
[14:51] worry about it and I can focus 100% on
[14:55] working and being there for my family
[14:57] and having fun with friends and working
[14:59] out and like all those things. But like
[15:01] I have now finally time again for life
[15:04] and I don't have to look at like 900
[15:06] p.m. which stock will come out tomorrow
[15:09] with an uh for with a 10K report or
[15:12] something like that. Uh or watch the
[15:14] conference calls. They can be fun if you
[15:16] like that. I I'm not a huge fan of that.
[15:19] Maybe it develops in the future, but uh
[15:21] it's not something that that I'm super
[15:23] passionate about. I was in the past, but
[15:26] I think I only was passionate about it
[15:28] because I I needed to do that and I
[15:31] didn't had anything else. So, I think
[15:34] the the clarity and the focus is is is
[15:36] really really cool. And then yeah, that
[15:38] that that's also what you kind of
[15:40] mentioned like if if you find that why
[15:42] do you need someone to to give you
[15:45] financial advice than if you just found
[15:48] that focus for yourself? Yeah. Um that
[15:51] is one of the nice things about Bitcoin
[15:53] and if you think about it where there's
[15:55] really two ways you can acquire more
[15:57] Bitcoin. You can either try to speculate
[16:00] on non- Bitcoin assets you think will
[16:02] perform more in order to increase
[16:04] Bitcoin holdings. And that's what a lot
[16:06] of crypto traders do. Or you can focus
[16:09] on Bitcoin as a savings vehicle and get
[16:11] to work providing some valuable service
[16:14] or product to your fellow man in order
[16:17] to earn money to acquire more Bitcoin.
[16:19] And the healthy version of a Bitcoin
[16:22] saver is someone who focuses on on the
[16:25] ladder where Bitcoin allows them to not
[16:29] drain their time, energy, and attention
[16:31] on trying to keep their money or
[16:34] speculate in order to make more money.
[16:36] It allows them to hold on to the
[16:39] purchasing power of what they've earned
[16:41] over the long term and focus that energy
[16:43] instead on producing more value, just
[16:46] like you outlined. And what that the
[16:50] correlary to that is that a lot of
[16:52] people who otherwise may have needed the
[16:54] help of a financial
[16:55] advisor don't really need the help of a
[16:58] financial advisor. Now at some point
[17:00] later in their life that may change. For
[17:02] example, a lot of the new clients that
[17:05] have come to our firm who are
[17:07] Bitcoiners, the reason is because
[17:09] they're uh, you know, significantly or
[17:12] mostly allocated to Bitcoin, but now
[17:14] they're going to retire and now they're
[17:17] starting to think seriously about uh
[17:20] what that means and whether they can
[17:22] withstand the volatility of having all
[17:24] of their portfolio in Bitcoin once they
[17:26] need to draw income off of that
[17:28] portfolio. So, you know, I tell
[17:31] investors a lot, you know, I talk to
[17:33] Bitcoiners who, you know, 100% Bitcoin
[17:37] and we have a great conversation, but at
[17:38] the end of it, I tell them, you probably
[17:40] don't need us at this point. Um, you
[17:43] know, until there's a trigger where it
[17:45] becomes necessary for you to start
[17:48] utilizing other financial tools other
[17:50] than Bitcoin, that's where we can really
[17:53] offer the most value. But for a lot of
[17:55] Bitcoiners, uh, they don't need that. So
[17:58] that's a fine distinction. I think
[18:01] that's actually uh interesting because
[18:04] it's a very popular topic in in Bitcoin
[18:07] this this retire on on on Bitcoin. And I
[18:09] think it's a very nuanced uh
[18:11] conversation because like it it highly
[18:14] depends on where you live, what's your
[18:16] circumstances, what are your what is
[18:19] your life expectancy, what is your uh
[18:21] expenses over life? Do you also only
[18:24] have to uh care for yourself or do you
[18:27] have like a family of five or something
[18:28] like that? So there's a lot of nuance to
[18:30] that. But how do you approach that if if
[18:33] Bitcoiners are coming to you and say
[18:34] like oh I want to retire on on on
[18:36] Bitcoin? I would say there the first
[18:39] question I ask them is why not just
[18:41] huddle 100% Bitcoin? Because if they
[18:44] don't have a good answer to that
[18:46] question then they don't need me. And in
[18:49] my experience, there's there's more than
[18:51] this, but there's three common reasons
[18:53] why that's the case. The first one is
[18:56] that their spouse is not as convicted
[18:58] about Bitcoin as they are. And you have
[19:01] to invest for the risk tolerance, time
[19:03] horizon, and financial goals of the
[19:05] household, not just the orange pill
[19:07] Bitcoiner who lives in that house. So,
[19:09] as a matter of practical uh
[19:12] compromise, you need a portfolio that
[19:14] includes things other than Bitcoin. The
[19:17] second reason I would say is black swan
[19:20] risk where you know there's a Bitcoiner
[19:23] that is as convinced as you can be
[19:25] convinced that Bitcoin is going to do by
[19:28] and large over the future what we think
[19:29] it's going to do but that we don't have
[19:32] a crystal ball. there may be unknown
[19:34] unknowns and just because of that they
[19:37] want to set themselves up so that bit if
[19:39] Bitcoin does do what they think it's
[19:41] going to do they're going to be in a
[19:43] very good place including potentially
[19:45] having financial doors open for them
[19:47] that otherwise would have never been
[19:49] opened but that they own enough
[19:51] non-Bitcoin assets that even if Bitcoin
[19:54] doesn't do what they think it's going to
[19:55] do they can still retire in comfort and
[19:58] dignity and accomplish their basic
[20:00] financial
[20:01] goals And then I would say the third
[20:05] reason just as a matter of practicality
[20:07] is they cannot or they are not willing
[20:09] to tolerate the volatility of being 100%
[20:12] Bitcoin. So you imagine a 65year-old
[20:15] with a $3 million portfolio 100% in
[20:18] Bitcoin who retires today.
[20:22] As convicted as that person may be in
[20:25] Bitcoin, the idea that their $3 million
[20:28] could draw down to
[20:30] $900,000 in a year in retirement, they
[20:33] are not willing to withstand that.
[20:34] They're not willing to go through that.
[20:36] So, as optimistic and as convicted as
[20:40] they are about Bitcoin, they make the
[20:42] decision that they want to start
[20:44] diversifying into other less volatile
[20:46] assets in order to produce their
[20:48] retirement income where Bitcoin still
[20:50] functions as their long-term store of
[20:52] value. But a common practice as clients
[20:56] approach or enter into retirement is
[20:58] starting to pivot assets away from a
[21:01] growth strategy into an income strategy.
[21:03] And that's true of Bitcoin as well.
[21:06] Yeah, volatility is a is an interesting
[21:08] topic. Um, I just pulled it uh pull it
[21:11] up next to you uh so you can also see
[21:13] it. Give me a second. We know and you
[21:17] probably have seen that chart uh where
[21:19] we see the the gold price in in in in my
[21:23] marks and it's going up between like
[21:25] 1914 and 1923. uh and you see the
[21:29] percentage change in gold price monthly
[21:32] which is just crazy to to see. So there
[21:35] was a really big volatility
[21:38] uh in the gold price when the the fiat
[21:41] currency basically uh collapsed. Uh and
[21:46] uh that's usually my answer to when
[21:50] people ask me what how will bitcoin
[21:52] volatility go down and I'm
[21:54] like compared to what in in in in
[21:58] purchasing power in in like to relations
[22:01] to the fiat currency and stuff like
[22:03] that. But most likely I think we are
[22:06] coming to the point where volatility
[22:08] might actually go up over a certain
[22:10] amount of time. How do you look at uh
[22:12] the the next 5 10 20 years whatever uh
[22:16] and the volatility of of Bitcoin going
[22:18] forward when you especially when you see
[22:20] something like that the first aspect
[22:23] that I look at is the volatil volatility
[22:26] will tend to trend upward or downward
[22:28] along with Bitcoin's long-term rate of
[22:30] return. So, a scenario where Bitcoin
[22:34] sustainably reaches lower levels of
[22:36] volatility almost by definition that
[22:39] means that its long-term rate of return
[22:41] has declined. You know, that's a
[22:43] fundamental trade-off where in general,
[22:46] the more an asset appreciates over time,
[22:49] the more volatile that it is along the
[22:51] way. So, over the next 5 to 10 years, I
[22:55] still expect that Bitcoin will perform
[22:57] well. And because of that, I expect it
[23:00] will still be quite
[23:01] volatile. I also think that you can
[23:03] think of Bitcoin's return or value as
[23:06] having two components. The first is
[23:08] growing Bitcoin adoption and the second
[23:10] is the devaluation of the currency that
[23:13] Bitcoin's value is denominated in.
[23:16] Currently, I would argue most of the
[23:19] performance has been driven by Bitcoin
[23:20] adoption. But there is a point in the
[23:23] future where even if that steadies out
[23:26] or reaches some sort of stable point,
[23:29] there could still be volatility because
[23:31] of increased devaluation of the
[23:32] currency. And there are good reasons to
[23:36] worry about that given the state of
[23:39] global debt loads, given the state of
[23:41] fiscal deficits and things like that.
[23:44] But I try to uh encourage clients to
[23:47] think of Bitcoin or using Bitcoin in two
[23:50] ways. The first is as a savings vehicle
[23:53] and the way to do that is to accumulate
[23:56] and hold Bitcoin. The other way Bitcoin
[23:59] can help clients is as a portfolio
[24:01] enhancer and in that way it's managed
[24:04] alongside traditional assets like
[24:06] stocks, bonds, mutual funds and it's
[24:08] rebalanced along with them. So in the
[24:11] case of a savings vehicle, the
[24:13] short-term volatility ultimately
[24:15] shouldn't matter too much. In the case
[24:17] of a portfolio enhancer, the volatility
[24:19] actually makes it more effective as a
[24:23] portfolio enhancer in terms of enhancing
[24:25] the risk adjusted return profile of an
[24:27] allocation.
[24:29] That's a it's an interesting way to look
[24:31] at it like in that way um as long as
[24:35] your outlook is long-term
[24:38] uh no matter how you look at it, um
[24:41] Bitcoin volatility is actually a good
[24:42] thing for you. It's a it's a feature uh
[24:45] for Bitcoin assets also means the the um
[24:49] potential gain u might be or probably is
[24:52] is higher than that. Uh and it is more
[24:55] effective also as a um portfolio
[24:58] enhancer. That's a really interesting uh
[25:00] way to look at it. Um, how do you look
[25:03] at Bitcoin related assets? Uh, like
[25:07] Micro Strategy as as a as a not strategy
[25:12] B now. I think they have the rebranding
[25:14] in there. Uh, how do you look at that
[25:18] for for leveraging maybe even Bitcoin
[25:21] because it's a little bit of a higher
[25:22] return or maybe even like uh going
[25:24] directly to a a leverage Bitcoin ETF or
[25:27] something like that. Yeah, Micro
[25:28] Strategy is interesting because uh among
[25:31] Bitcoiners especially, it is the first
[25:34] investment where Bitcoin's the hurdle
[25:36] rate. So, I have a lot of clients who
[25:39] are Bitcoiners who own Micro Strategy.
[25:42] And there's only one reason why they own
[25:44] it. It's because on a riskadjusted
[25:46] basis, they believe it has a good chance
[25:47] of outperforming Bitcoin. And so in that
[25:50] case, they're more properly making an
[25:53] investment with a with an opportunity
[25:56] cost of saving hard money. So they're
[25:59] not investing because they have to
[26:01] invest in something. They have the
[26:04] alternative, a viable alternative of
[26:06] just holding Bitcoin. But when applying
[26:08] Bitcoin as the hurdle rate to any
[26:10] investment, Micro Strategy is really the
[26:12] first one where that is the proper and
[26:15] common hurdle rate people associate with
[26:18] in terms of holding stock.
[26:20] Um my answer is much different for
[26:23] things like leveraged products. I think
[26:26] um in general unless somebody you know
[26:29] knows what they're doing or unless
[26:30] they're using it for a specific trade or
[26:33] hedge um for a lot of people that's
[26:36] probably advisable to stay away from
[26:38] things like that. But um Micro Strategy
[26:41] is interesting because in a world where
[26:44] Bitcoin adoption continues, in a world
[26:46] where we see something like a Bitcoin
[26:48] standard, where it evolves past just a
[26:52] store of value and starts reaching
[26:54] adoption as far as a common medium of
[26:56] exchange unit of account, investments
[26:59] will increasingly be viewed with the
[27:01] opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin. I
[27:04] mean, if there's a company that is
[27:06] proposing some investment to raise
[27:08] money, more and more people will
[27:10] continually ask themselves, why would I
[27:12] deploy my money at risk in this business
[27:14] venture when I can just hold Bitcoin?
[27:16] And the answer is that business has to
[27:18] provide on a riskadjusted basis the
[27:21] opportunity for that investment to
[27:23] outperform Bitcoin.
[27:25] So we're micro strategy is the beginning
[27:28] of that, but I think it is a trend that
[27:31] we're going to continue to see over the
[27:32] next 10 to 20 years. It's a good
[27:34] indication of what's to come. Is then
[27:36] the the question of I think they call it
[27:39] Bitcoin yield. I don't I don't like the
[27:41] word because there's no yield on
[27:42] Bitcoin, but they they use it basically
[27:44] on like how many more bitcoins uh they
[27:46] accumulate and how effective they are in
[27:48] in stacking Bitcoin. Is is that then
[27:51] maybe a new uh almost like an EP uh um
[27:56] earnings per share EPS uh one that that
[27:59] is now popular or like the PE ratios
[28:01] that we now have is is is is how many
[28:04] more Bitcoin can you stack or uh how how
[28:08] effective can you outperform Bitcoin a
[28:10] future key metrics of of company
[28:13] performances?
[28:15] Yeah, earnings per share is probably the
[28:17] closest analogy. Um the challenge with
[28:20] Micro Strategy is they're doing
[28:21] something that no company has ever done
[28:24] and they're implementing that strategy
[28:26] on an asset that no one has ever used
[28:28] before. So people are struggling to try
[28:32] to figure out what the true value of a
[28:34] company like that is. And but that's
[28:36] what makes a market. So, you know,
[28:38] people will criticize the uh the KPI of
[28:43] Bitcoin yield and you know, they'll
[28:45] they'll attack it because it's not
[28:47] actually a yield or you know, this or
[28:49] that. But I think in some ways it is a
[28:51] as useful as any other framework for
[28:53] understanding what it is that the
[28:55] company is doing. But I think uh over
[28:58] time market participants are just going
[29:00] to have to continue to wrestle with how
[29:04] you actually value an asset like this.
[29:06] But ultimately the market's going to
[29:09] decide that. So um Bitcoin yields a
[29:12] useful framework. It's the one that
[29:14] Micro Strategy tends to focus on in
[29:16] their public
[29:17] communications. And I think if you
[29:20] understand it as an attempt to explain
[29:22] something that's unprecedented, then it
[29:25] is a useful framework. Even if there are
[29:27] things we could nitpick about it as not
[29:28] being technically or specifically
[29:31] accurate as it relates to traditional
[29:33] financial metrics, it it's not the same,
[29:35] but it's not trying to be the same. It's
[29:38] trying to offer a
[29:40] coherent metric for evaluating what
[29:43] Micro Strategy is doing over time and
[29:45] whether or not they're successful in
[29:46] that. And so far, they have been.
[29:50] What what are the implications uh of
[29:53] Bitcoin being the hurdle rate for
[29:56] companies uh and and for investors and
[29:59] uh resource allocators in general
[30:02] companies I think
[30:04] it in some ways it makes it harder to
[30:07] raise capital in order to start a
[30:09] company you need to have a good idea you
[30:11] need to have good execution there's you
[30:13] know one of the problems with
[30:16] artificially expanded money supply is
[30:19] People have money they have to do
[30:20] something with. Uh when your money is a
[30:23] melting ice cube, any crappy
[30:25] refrigerator is better than nothing.
[30:28] So file money induces a lot of
[30:31] malinvestment. A lot of investment in
[30:33] business ideas or projects that in a
[30:35] truly free market with a free market
[30:38] money would have never existed in the
[30:40] first place. So for business owners, it
[30:44] induces on them a responsibility to
[30:47] actually have a good idea with good
[30:49] execution that has a shot of producing
[30:51] real returns for investors. For capital
[30:56] allocators, I think it inverts the
[30:59] burden of proof on them to find those
[31:01] business owners and find those companies
[31:03] that can actually do that.
[31:06] So we may see a scenario where there are
[31:09] fewer publicly traded companies, there
[31:11] are fewer stocks, there are fewer
[31:13] entrepreneurs, um we see a realignment
[31:16] in the economy because of that. You can
[31:19] think of a lot of downstream effects and
[31:21] some of them I think will be second and
[31:22] third order and they may not be obvious
[31:24] where we sit today but broadly speaking
[31:28] I think Bitcoin as a hurdle rate. It
[31:30] makes
[31:32] investment one option of several viable
[31:35] options because saving money is a viable
[31:37] alternative now whereas before you had
[31:40] to invest in something or you get
[31:42] diluted away. Let's take a break for a
[31:45] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[31:47] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[31:50] watches. Those watches are the most
[31:53] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[31:56] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[31:59] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[32:02] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:05] watch collections. You have the date of
[32:08] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[32:11] there. And of course, also the block
[32:13] height and which epoch we are currently
[32:16] in. I love the level of detail they put
[32:19] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[32:22] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:24] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[32:27] love those watches so so much. And now,
[32:30] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[32:33] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[32:35] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[32:37] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[32:39] first way is you put it on a hardware
[32:41] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[32:44] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[32:47] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[32:50] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[32:53] if you check out the link in the
[32:55] description, you even get 5% off if you
[32:58] use the code Robin. And the second way
[33:00] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[33:03] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[33:07] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[33:09] They will personalize for you a
[33:12] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[33:14] your individual situation. They will
[33:17] show you how you can secure your own
[33:20] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[33:22] enough. You also have to keep all your
[33:24] devices secure. One topic that is
[33:26] overlooked often is the inheritance
[33:29] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[33:32] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[33:34] a plan for that in place already? And
[33:37] last but not least, if you're in a
[33:39] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[33:41] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[33:44] that, head over to the
[33:47] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[33:50] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[33:53] be for the first time ever speaking at
[33:56] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:58] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[34:01] really looking forward to seeing all of
[34:03] you there. You can get your ticket in
[34:06] the link down in the description of
[34:08] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[34:10] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[34:14] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[34:15] there. Yeah, I'm thinking uh like VC
[34:19] money is is a big thing for for small
[34:21] companies and it's like if if you as a
[34:25] VC have Bitcoin as an option uh in your
[34:29] portfolio and you know the hurdle rate
[34:32] of of of Bitcoin and how attractive this
[34:34] is and how reliable this is, you look at
[34:37] investments probably a lot different of
[34:39] like okay like what are you actually
[34:41] trying to do long term? uh if as a VC
[34:45] you don't have Bitcoin as an option and
[34:46] and you just uh have to invest in
[34:49] something and you're forced to because
[34:51] the US dollar that you hold or even
[34:53] worse other fiat currencies is just
[34:55] melting away. You're really forced to
[34:57] like oh I have to spend I have here uh
[35:00] $2 million I have to give it some
[35:02] startup otherwise it will melt away.
[35:04] Yeah, venture capital I think is um
[35:07] another industry that Bitcoin will
[35:09] disrupt um along with investment capital
[35:11] allocation in general because over the
[35:14] last 10 years there have been a lot of
[35:16] good investments when denominated in
[35:18] dollars. But when you stack it to the
[35:21] opportunity cost of just holding
[35:23] Bitcoin, you end up putting in a lot of
[35:26] analysis and a lot of effort and taking
[35:28] on a lot of risk in order to end up with
[35:31] less Bitcoin than you would have if you
[35:33] had just purchased Bitcoin when you made
[35:35] the investment. And I think that will
[35:38] over time start to fundamentally change
[35:41] the nature of investments and how we
[35:43] evaluate
[35:45] uh their investment worthiness. and
[35:47] venture capital certainly is a big part
[35:49] of that. Just wanted to show you my one
[35:51] of my favorite sites, but it seems to be
[35:53] down at the moment.
[35:56] Just still show you quickly. Uh you're
[35:59] probably aware of of that site priced in
[36:01] priced in Bitcoin 21, but apparently
[36:04] they just have some some hiccup in the
[36:07] in in the system. Uh which is really
[36:10] interesting when you actually look in
[36:12] things and you make that shift of um
[36:15] pricing things. uh in evaluating things
[36:18] in Bitcoin rather than in your local
[36:21] fiat currency, US dollar, euro or
[36:23] whatever. Uh it really makes you rethink
[36:26] things and and there's one uh really
[36:29] interesting aspect and I'm curious what
[36:31] was your take on that. I now earn
[36:34] bitcoin and I'm now forced to either
[36:37] sell or spend my bitcoin somehow because
[36:40] uh yeah my my income is in bitcoin and I
[36:45] have still a small fiat income in my
[36:49] psychology even though I know it does
[36:51] not matter in in it does not matter if I
[36:55] spend a bitcoin or the fiat if I have
[36:57] 100% bitcoin anyways like there there's
[37:00] no real change in there the hesitation
[37:03] of spending bitcoin is so much higher
[37:06] for me then the hesitation of uh getting
[37:09] from that fiat uh amount it it doesn't
[37:13] make sense because like I'm 100% bitcoin
[37:15] anyways but there's a psychology barrier
[37:17] there which is super interesting uh
[37:20] what's your take on this yeah it it's in
[37:24] one sense it's purely psychological
[37:27] because when you spend dollars there's
[37:30] still the opportunity cost of you could
[37:32] have bought more Bitcoin with it. So,
[37:34] the net effect is the same, but I've
[37:37] noticed in myself and I've talked to a
[37:40] lot of Bitcoiners where that's been the
[37:42] case where um you don't want to spend
[37:45] your Bitcoin. Um it's a lot easier to
[37:48] spend dollars. So, and I've seen um I've
[37:51] seen, you know, a lot of people where
[37:53] Bitcoin made
[37:55] it attractive for them to save money.
[37:58] people who otherwise before discovering
[38:00] Bitcoin had a hard time saving money. Um
[38:03] that is not the case when it comes to
[38:05] accumulating Bitcoin where you know if
[38:07] they've got 50 or $100,000 in a savings
[38:10] account it it's hard for them not to tap
[38:13] into that for purchases that maybe they
[38:16] really shouldn't be making or they don't
[38:18] need. And if that's $50 to $100,000 of
[38:21] Bitcoin, they will at least think twice
[38:24] because they don't want fewer sacks. So,
[38:27] you know, it's one of those things where
[38:29] for someone living on a Bitcoin standard
[38:32] for pure convenience or transactional
[38:35] friction, it probably makes sense in
[38:38] most jurisdictions at this point to
[38:40] maintain a balance of fiat because at
[38:43] least in the United States, US dollars
[38:46] are still the dominant asset as far as a
[38:48] medium of exchange. It's far easier to
[38:51] spend dollars. Everyone accepts them.
[38:53] And that's really not different when you
[38:55] look at other countries where it's
[38:58] common that they will use two forms of
[39:00] money. Um if you look at nations with uh
[39:04] much higher inflation problems than the
[39:06] United States, it's common that they
[39:09] will use the uh legal tender in their
[39:13] political jurisdiction. That's their
[39:14] medium of exchange. That's what they get
[39:16] paid in. That's what their expenses are
[39:17] denominated in. But they don't store
[39:19] their wealth in that money. they store
[39:21] their wealth in the US dollar or
[39:23] Bitcoin. And in the United States, I
[39:26] think Bitcoin currently and for the
[39:29] foreseeable future will provide that
[39:32] function where even though the dollar
[39:34] will still be the dominant medium of
[39:36] exchange just because lower
[39:38] transactional friction, uh higher, you
[39:41] know, efficiency, higher availability
[39:43] and acceptability. Um, Bitcoin offers
[39:47] the savings component and so the US with
[39:50] Bitcoin is going to become a like a lot
[39:52] of other countries like Turkey,
[39:54] Venezuela, Argentina where uh, you know,
[39:58] it it functions as the US dollar does in
[40:01] those jurisdictions.
[40:03] Super interesting. It it kind of makes
[40:05] savings cool again. Like you're saving
[40:09] money is is is a weird thing now. Like,
[40:12] oh, like why are you saving? why are you
[40:13] not investing? And and it makes the the
[40:16] saving terminology and the saving
[40:18] process cool again. Yeah. And not only
[40:22] that, but it um and again the it's
[40:25] artificial or it's arbitrary, but it
[40:29] creates very attractive savings goals.
[40:32] Like for example, the idea of being a
[40:34] whole coiner, that's just as arbitrary
[40:37] as being a millionaire. But there are a
[40:41] lot of people who are very motivated to
[40:43] achieve that status. Whereas, you know,
[40:46] right now Bitcoin's
[40:48] $82,000, let's say, that person may be
[40:52] laser focused on achieving a h 100red
[40:55] million Satoshi's in their possession.
[40:57] Whereas the idea of accumulating 82
[40:59] grand of savings does nothing to them.
[41:02] They could not care less about that
[41:04] because they're looking at the hundred
[41:06] million sats, not any particular dollar
[41:08] amount. So, I agree with you that that's
[41:11] a good way to put it. It makes savings
[41:13] cool again, but it also for a lot of
[41:16] people gives a strong motivational urge
[41:19] to save money to achieve albeit
[41:23] arbitrary uh or artificial benchmarks or
[41:25] goals.
[41:27] Yeah, this get to one Bitcoin, get to
[41:29] 0.1 Bitcoin. It's it's very popular for
[41:32] some reason. Uh but it's very Yeah, as
[41:34] you say, like it does not make sense
[41:36] where you pick your number. It's just
[41:38] like, yeah, get more Bitcoin, it makes
[41:40] sense. But
[41:43] um if you're talking to someone has a
[41:46] net worth of $100
[41:48] million, if you tell him, oh, you should
[41:50] get the one Bitcoin, that might be
[41:52] interesting for him to get to know about
[41:54] Bitcoin and learn more about Bitcoin.
[41:56] but he should get to a lot more Bitcoin
[41:58] than that. If you're talking to someone
[42:00] that has uh
[42:02] $10,000 uh at his total net worth, it
[42:05] will be a very hard journey for him to
[42:07] get to one Bitcoin. Uh it will take very
[42:10] long and maybe he never gets there
[42:12] because Bitcoin's price is running away
[42:14] from him. Th those messages are always
[42:18] um maybe confusing because like only a
[42:22] small portion of of of people that are
[42:24] actually relevant like you have maybe
[42:27] 0.56 bitcoin then maybe getting the
[42:30] whole bitcoin is realistic and and
[42:32] really motivating for someone else is
[42:34] like oh I have two bitcoin like why
[42:35] should I get there? So there's like this
[42:37] arbitrary number of like one is a human
[42:40] psychology thing. Yeah, it it is. But it
[42:44] it's very real. Like um we we have
[42:46] multiple clients who their first Bitcoin
[42:48] purchase, they tell us, "Okay, I'll buy
[42:51] a coin." And they said that when Bitcoin
[42:53] was 20,000. They said that when Bitcoin
[42:55] was
[42:56] 106,000. Um that when they decide that
[43:00] they're going to buy some Bitcoin, they
[43:01] wanted a coin. Um so that uh again, it's
[43:06] arbitrary in some sense, but that that
[43:09] does motivate human behavior. and we've
[43:11] seen that firsthand with our clients.
[43:13] Um, but that plays just as much of a
[43:16] role, I think, in the motivation to save
[43:18] and hit those arbitrary goals. But
[43:21] arbitrary or not, um, the fact of the
[43:24] matter is people who otherwise wouldn't
[43:26] have been are now motivated to save
[43:28] their money. And that's an interesting
[43:30] thing to watch.
[43:32] It's also interesting when I talk with
[43:35] people very far away from Bitcoin. Um,
[43:39] which things they bring up why they're
[43:41] not buying Bitcoin. Uh, and one of the
[43:44] things that they sometimes bring up is
[43:46] like, oh, it's too
[43:47] expensive. Uh, because uh, what is
[43:51] communicated is usually the US dollar or
[43:56] euro price for one whole Bitcoin. Uh and
[44:00] people the same with uh stocks the same
[44:02] with like that's why stock splits are
[44:04] thing you you split your stocks you get
[44:07] uh uh half the half the share price and
[44:10] double the amount of of shares nothing
[44:13] changes where people are like oh now
[44:14] finally there's some some thing around
[44:17] that uh with bitcoin we cannot do that
[44:20] marketing wise directly with with having
[44:24] uh
[44:25] like bringing the share price of one
[44:27] bitcoin but there is this thing of
[44:29] Satoshi's and and micro bitcoins and all
[44:31] those things. Uh but it's interesting
[44:34] how people see like oh like one bitcoin
[44:36] is is
[44:38] $85,000. Oh, I can never afford that.
[44:40] Like that that's for rich people only.
[44:43] uh this this unit price bias is really a
[44:47] lot in our brains is almost frustrating
[44:50] that that people don't see through that
[44:52] the barrier and don't even some there
[44:54] are people out there that don't realize
[44:55] that they can buy a fraction of a
[44:57] Bitcoin. I'm I'm continually surprised
[45:01] by how few people realize that that you
[45:05] can subdivide Bitcoin into 100 million
[45:08] subunits called Satoshi's.
[45:10] That is still very common among
[45:12] investors who otherwise might allocate
[45:14] to bitcoin is well I can't afford a
[45:16] bitcoin because that is still not common
[45:19] knowledge that you don't have to buy a
[45:21] whole bitcoin you can buy any arbitrary
[45:23] amount of bitcoin and unfortunately I
[45:27] think that unit bias drives a lot of the
[45:29] interest in
[45:31] altcoins because it's like well you know
[45:33] bitcoin went from nothing to 85,000 I
[45:36] missed the boat on that one but you know
[45:39] here's altcoin XYZ and it's only 50
[45:41] cents a token or two bucks a token. You
[45:44] know, maybe this one will go to
[45:46] $85,000. Um, that is the mindset and
[45:50] thought process of a lot of people who
[45:52] are gambling on altcoins is maybe this
[45:54] will be the next Bitcoin. And what they
[45:57] don't understand is that if Bitcoin is
[45:59] what it purports to be, as Michael
[46:02] Sailor says, it's going up forever. You
[46:05] didn't miss anything. The correct move
[46:08] is to allocate whatever is appropriate
[46:10] for you at the time it's appropriate to
[46:12] Bitcoin, whatever amount that happens to
[46:14] be. But there's still some education
[46:17] that has to be done, I think, before for
[46:20] the person who's far away from it before
[46:22] that becomes a a common approach.
[46:27] That's you you hit something uh there
[46:30] where um I I got that comment a lot in
[46:34] 2021. uh 21 for explanation I didn't
[46:38] have the podcast but I did make uh Tik
[46:42] Tok short videos uh on Tik Tok uh for
[46:45] Bitcoin um uh I think I never told that
[46:49] on the podcast actually but I I made a
[46:52] very short uh informative video around
[46:54] Bitcoin and there it was crazy how many
[46:58] messages I got saying oh this XYC token
[47:03] is now at 4 cents uh and Bitcoin went to
[47:09] uh 69,000. If my token only goes to $1,
[47:13] then I make that amount of money. But
[47:16] then you actually look at the
[47:17] tokconomics and you're like, if that
[47:20] token goes to $1, then market
[47:22] capitalization would be bigger than
[47:24] Bitcoin itself. So there's some there
[47:27] are some basic understandings of
[47:30] economics and investing not there. Uh
[47:33] and in the in the end of the day we can
[47:35] say like oh have fun staying poor and
[47:37] like uh it does not matter it's your
[47:39] fault. But I'm always the uh conviction
[47:43] of we have we have a duty of of
[47:46] explaining the basics of of economics
[47:48] and the basics of Bitcoin and the basics
[47:50] of investings as as much as possible. uh
[47:54] and and we should kindly orange pill uh
[47:57] even those people that uh might be
[48:00] frustrating to to orange pill and and
[48:02] not go the other right route and saying
[48:04] like oh like have fun staying poor.
[48:06] Yeah. Yeah. I think that that's a good
[48:09] point and I think a thing that
[48:11] Bitcoiners learn as they get deeper in
[48:14] the rabbit hole is um you know not just
[48:17] the importance of trying to orange pill
[48:19] the people that you care about but in
[48:22] effectively doing that and there there's
[48:25] a few things I mean by that. One is that
[48:27] a lesson that I've learned uh in my five
[48:31] or so years as a Bitcoiner is you have
[48:34] to meet people where they are and you
[48:36] cannot orange pill someone against their
[48:39] will. So I have learned not to beat my
[48:42] head against the wall on someone who's
[48:43] just not receptive to it because every
[48:46] second that I spend doing that is a
[48:48] second that I'm not talking to someone
[48:50] who would be receptive to it. And now
[48:53] with what we've been able to do here at
[48:55] my firm, now that we're able to offer
[48:57] Bitcoin and educate about Bitcoin,
[49:00] um there are plenty of Bitcoiners who
[49:03] need and want our help that I in some
[49:06] ways find it a disservice to try to
[49:09] spend my time trying to convince people
[49:11] who aren't open to it to take a look at
[49:14] Bitcoin because every second that I do
[49:16] that is a second that I'm not spending
[49:19] with someone who wants to talk to a
[49:21] financial adviser that understands
[49:23] Bitcoin. That is a massively underserved
[49:26] niche of wealth management clientele. So
[49:28] my my thinking on that has evolved over
[49:31] time, but to your point, if Bitcoin is
[49:35] what we think it is, in some ways, we
[49:37] still have a duty to try to tell those
[49:39] that we care about and at least give
[49:41] them the chance to embrace it. We can't
[49:43] force them to, but that's definitely
[49:45] important.
[49:47] There is an aspect and I I definitely
[49:50] did that in the beginning where I tried
[49:52] to aggressively and and and in a almost
[49:56] in a in a way of like hey I found the
[49:58] solution to life and I want to tell
[49:59] everyone kind of kind of way and I take
[50:03] a way more passive approach now I tell
[50:06] everyone I'm a Bitcoiner. Uh I'm I'm I'm
[50:09] I usually have some kind of Bitcoin
[50:11] t-shirt on if I go somewhere. I I I I I
[50:14] I
[50:15] I actively bring up Bitcoin if it makes
[50:18] sense. Uh and usually I'm I'm in such a
[50:22] Bitcoin bubble that if I meet other
[50:24] people, uh they pro they usually
[50:26] introduce them to like, oh, he is the
[50:28] Bitcoin guy. So the topic usually comes
[50:30] up just with me being on the on the
[50:33] table. Um, so now it's more convenient
[50:36] and and I completely switched now to um
[50:41] only educating people on Bitcoin deeply
[50:45] if they have an honest um will to learn.
[50:50] Uh but I discovered that most people are
[50:54] very honest and they actually want to
[50:56] learn. some people uh uh but I have not
[51:01] met actually in the last two years
[51:03] anyone in real life on Twitter you see
[51:05] them all the time and I don't spend any
[51:07] time with them but in real life I never
[51:08] met someone uh that said like oh like
[51:11] Bitcoin is bad for environment Bitcoin
[51:13] is that and that uh and uh when I just
[51:17] went in a conversation with them and say
[51:19] like oh like why do you think that and
[51:20] and and then just like went down the
[51:23] rabbit hole with them um they they
[51:26] usually are open to to to what I have to
[51:28] say, but maybe I'm already too close to
[51:31] to the Bitcoin bubble.
[51:34] Yeah. Well, what what you just
[51:35] described, I I consider that um a a
[51:39] maturation process for Bitcoiners where
[51:42] you're exactly right. When the light
[51:44] bulb first goes off, you're
[51:45] understandably very excited about it and
[51:48] you want to share what you've discovered
[51:49] with people,
[51:50] but but no one likes a monoomaniac, you
[51:54] know? You you don't want to be the guy
[51:56] at poker night who just spends the whole
[51:58] evening talking about Bitcoin. That's
[52:00] not what your friends want. You know,
[52:02] you want to spend time with your friends
[52:03] and, you know, be enjoyable to be
[52:05] around. And um if one one of the things
[52:08] that I'll say often is that if you're a
[52:11] Bitcoiner, your friends and family know
[52:14] who to talk to if they have questions.
[52:16] You don't need to beat them over the
[52:18] head with it. So what you just described
[52:20] of taking a more passive approach,
[52:23] bringing it up when it makes sense and
[52:25] otherwise just being ready to help and
[52:27] engage when people are ready for it. I
[52:30] think that's a that's a common
[52:32] transformation that Bitcoiners go
[52:35] through in their first couple of years
[52:38] where um you know they turn from you
[52:41] know zealots or
[52:43] evangelicals into um you know practical
[52:47] helpers for the people who are ready for
[52:48] it.
[52:49] And that I think that's an important
[52:52] transition to make because that allows
[52:54] you to focus again back to your one of
[52:56] your first points. Focus your time on
[52:58] what matters on what actually provides
[53:00] value to you and the people around you.
[53:02] And one of the things that doesn't do
[53:04] that is arguing with uh anti- bitcoiners
[53:08] on Twitter. That does not change
[53:10] anyone's mind. That um by and large does
[53:13] not help people. The one exception to
[53:16] that I would say is helping to refute
[53:19] arguments made by influential people.
[53:21] That that can have some value. And if
[53:23] you're doing it for that reason,
[53:25] then then that's okay. But um you know,
[53:29] a lot of time and energy is wasted
[53:31] arguing with people who no matter what
[53:33] you say are never going to accept your
[53:36] argument. They uh they're ideologically
[53:39] opposed to Bitcoin because it
[53:41] contradicts fundamental pillars of their
[53:43] worldview. And uh that's true for a lot
[53:46] of financial prof professionals by the
[53:48] way which I think is why
[53:51] counterintuitively our industry is one
[53:54] of the industries that's least inclined
[53:57] to understand Bitcoin on a deep level.
[54:00] Um as a side note I would make the
[54:03] comment that people in the energy
[54:04] industry seem to be the opposite. The
[54:06] people I talk to there are probably the
[54:10] most likely to at least get it in some
[54:13] capacity. Um but finance and law and a
[54:16] few other white collar professions um I
[54:19] think they really run into that
[54:21] ideological contradiction and it induces
[54:24] cognitive dissonance and they really
[54:26] have to rethink some foundational
[54:28] assumptions before they're ever going to
[54:31] be ready to even listen to a Bitcoiner.
[54:34] Yeah. And I I have a framework and and
[54:37] I'm I'm curious what you think about it.
[54:39] I have a framework which journey
[54:41] Bitcoiners go through. uh they start off
[54:44] almost as a cult leader of like trying
[54:47] to get people to to join some groups. Uh
[54:50] then they go more and more on the
[54:52] passive sides where they are almost like
[54:54] a salesperson but still a little bit on
[54:57] on the offensive side. And I think the
[54:58] the target where you are uh on on with a
[55:02] lot of OGs and a lot of people that are
[55:05] let's say a a cycle or more than a cycle
[55:08] in there uh they're going just to be an
[55:11] educator. So, they are happy to help uh
[55:14] and they they're happy to go down four
[55:17] hours with you on an evening with a
[55:19] glass of wine, just going really deep
[55:21] down the rabbit hole and and just
[55:23] explaining everything to you. And
[55:24] they're patient and they like, "Oh, like
[55:26] if you want to set up a wallet, like
[55:28] I'll help you and everything like that,
[55:31] but they're never trying to push Bitcoin
[55:33] on you. They're just like, if you're
[55:34] interested in, let's talk. If you're
[55:36] not, let's not talk. then let's just
[55:38] enjoy the game like uh in that regard.
[55:42] Yeah, that that's the exact framework
[55:45] that um my career has taken over the
[55:48] last five years where for our existing
[55:51] clients who aren't Bitcoiners, our focus
[55:53] now is education. Uh you know, we do
[55:56] Bitcoin seminars, webinars, we bring it
[55:59] up in client meetings. Uh if a client is
[56:02] not interested, doesn't want it, that's
[56:04] fine. Um, I usually tell them, you know,
[56:07] that that's cool. I'll bring this up
[56:09] once a year until one of us is dead, but
[56:11] if you don't want to do it, then you
[56:14] don't have to. But my focus for serving
[56:17] new clients is people who are already
[56:20] Bitcoiners. So, in terms of, you know,
[56:23] growing our business, I'm not focused on
[56:26] trying to convince anyone about Bitcoin
[56:29] because, like I mentioned earlier, there
[56:30] are already plenty of Bitcoiners who
[56:33] need and want our help. And it makes far
[56:37] more sense. It's we provide far more
[56:39] value in focusing on those people than
[56:43] beating our head against the wall trying
[56:44] to convince non- Bitcoiner clients to
[56:46] take a look at this thing. When there
[56:48] are investors who I mentioned before,
[56:51] they're Bitcoiners. They have a lot of
[56:53] Bitcoin. They're getting ready to retire
[56:54] and they want help. That's the person
[56:57] I'm now focused on in terms of growing
[56:59] the business. And it's moved purely to
[57:02] an educational framework for the clients
[57:05] who are not Bitcoiners. Which brings me
[57:07] to an interesting part. I wanted to
[57:08] bring that up earlier, but I think it
[57:11] now fits also nicely. what what do you
[57:13] think is the future of like wealth
[57:16] management financial advisors because I
[57:19] do think there is there is some sort of
[57:21] role there uh even in a bitcoin only
[57:24] world uh h how do you think this this
[57:28] will look like if we're really on
[57:31] bitcoin and everyone gets bitcoin I
[57:33] think it will largely look similar to
[57:36] what it looks like now it's just that
[57:39] now in a financial plan or on an
[57:43] investor's balance sheet, there's this
[57:45] new thing called long-term savings,
[57:48] which is Bitcoin, and the rest of the
[57:51] pie is going to be evaluated based on
[57:53] the opportunity cost of that. So in my
[57:57] experience
[57:59] um most Bitcoiners with substantial
[58:03] wealth are not and do not want to be
[58:06] 100% Bitcoin for largely for one of the
[58:09] three mention three reasons I mentioned
[58:11] before. Their spouse doesn't want to be.
[58:14] they're unwilling or unable to handle
[58:16] the volatility or black swan risk where
[58:20] they want to keep and own and hold
[58:22] enough that if it does what they think
[58:24] it's going to do then they're going to
[58:26] be in a good place. But even though they
[58:29] don't think it's likely, even though
[58:30] they can't really imagine a realistic
[58:33] reason why it might happen, they don't
[58:36] want to be put in a position where if
[58:39] Bitcoin fails that they're ruined.
[58:42] So even if Bitcoin adoption increases by
[58:47] orders of magnitude from here, I think
[58:50] for people with who have accumulated
[58:53] substantial wealth, there is still going
[58:55] to be a component of generating income,
[58:58] diversified portfolio management, things
[59:00] like that, it'll just happen
[59:02] alongside a significant component of
[59:05] huddled Bitcoin. And then you see a
[59:08] component where advisers will
[59:09] increasingly help clients with custody
[59:12] optimization, helping them strike the
[59:14] smartest balance with self-custody,
[59:17] uh, you know, multi-IG custody, custody
[59:21] solutions, and increasingly we're going
[59:23] to see financial
[59:25] products, some of which we can't even
[59:27] imagine right now, that allow Bitcoin
[59:30] holders to do useful things with their
[59:33] Bitcoin. Um, so I think over time
[59:36] that'll become an increased part of
[59:39] wealth management offerings, but at this
[59:41] point the the main one is just having,
[59:44] you know, 100% long exposure to the
[59:46] asset, whether that's holding actual
[59:48] Bitcoin or via a spot ETF or something
[59:51] like that. It's also something that um
[59:53] I'm curious uh of like once Bitcoin gets
[59:57] to a maturity point. Um I mean for me
[60:00] it's also I'm I'm very young. I'm with
[60:02] 26. So I'm have a high risk appetite. I
[60:05] don't want to have anything else than
[60:08] Bitcoin. I'm I'm happy with a black
[60:09] swan. I'm I I don't need to diversify in
[60:13] there. Uh but um what happens if Bitcoin
[60:16] is kind of maturing a little bit? If if
[60:18] Bitcoin is uh is not at 2% uh adoption
[60:22] rate but uh at 80% adoption rate, 75%
[60:26] 90% of of adoption rate uh then the then
[60:30] the upside is is not as intriguing
[60:33] anymore and you can use Bitcoin just as
[60:35] savings and maybe you have I don't know
[60:37] 80% 60% 95% or 50% in in savings in
[60:42] Bitcoin and with the other uh side of
[60:45] your portfolio it then again makes more
[60:48] sense to look in investing options of
[60:50] like oh like what is an a cool company
[60:53] that you believe in the future in or do
[60:55] you want to do venture capital or do you
[60:57] want to do something with that which is
[60:59] super interesting you think about what
[61:01] happens when all those bitcoiners are
[61:03] all of a sudden the wealthy elites that
[61:07] control the resource and the allocations
[61:09] and they deciding where the money kind
[61:11] of goes. It's very exciting to to to
[61:13] think about that world and when I see
[61:15] now in the Bitcoin crowd how what values
[61:19] they have and and how low time
[61:21] preference they are. What if the future
[61:24] time uh the future resource allocators
[61:27] are those Bitcoiners that have this low
[61:30] time preference and re uh put the the
[61:32] allocations in there. It's super
[61:34] exciting for for me how how a Bitcoin
[61:37] world looks like. That's why I also
[61:38] asked you like oh like what's the future
[61:40] of wealth management because it's super
[61:42] interesting to think about that that
[61:44] Bitcoin world and the impact it it will
[61:46] have on on all of us.
[61:49] Yeah. I think one thing it'll do is it
[61:51] will make invest investing active again
[61:55] where with the devaluation of fiat
[61:58] currency we've seen a massive
[61:59] proliferation of passive investing
[62:01] trends. Um, you know, index investing is
[62:04] a big example of that
[62:06] where in actuality what people are doing
[62:08] is they're not investing. They're trying
[62:10] to save their money because, you know,
[62:12] if you buy an index of hundreds of
[62:14] different companies, why are you buying
[62:15] it? It's not because you like that
[62:17] company. It's not because you're
[62:18] expressing an opinion about the future
[62:21] profitability or value of that company.
[62:24] You're just passively plowing money into
[62:26] some basket of stocks that was selected
[62:28] by some, you know, group or board or
[62:30] whatever. And in a world where you have
[62:34] Bitcoiners allocating capital now,
[62:37] they're only going to do that if it's an
[62:39] investment that they care about, that
[62:41] they understand, and that they want to
[62:43] get behind. The idea that you just
[62:46] passively put money at risk into a
[62:49] business venture, I think in that world
[62:52] will seem strange and weird and it won't
[62:55] be as common. But also, you're going to
[62:57] have a lot of people who just aren't
[62:59] investors. they don't want to do it. Um,
[63:02] one thing I've seen in my career is that
[63:04] a lot of clients that I work with are
[63:06] not truly
[63:07] investors. If they could, they would
[63:09] just save money. They don't want to take
[63:11] risk in the stock market. They don't
[63:13] want to see the volatility. Um, you
[63:16] know, when the market drops 10%, they
[63:19] lose sleep at night. If they could, they
[63:21] would just save money, but they can't.
[63:23] So, they have to invest. And in a world
[63:25] where Bitcoin achieves that type of
[63:27] adoption, those people can just hold
[63:30] money and if they don't want to, they
[63:32] don't have to deploy it at risk in a
[63:34] investment or a business venture.
[63:36] That's very true. I love it. Um, it was
[63:39] already a great episode. Um, we have one
[63:42] question that I ask each and every one
[63:43] of my guests and the question for you
[63:45] is, what can we learn from you besides
[63:48] Bitcoin? What can you learn from me
[63:50] besides Bitcoin? Oh, that's a good
[63:53] question. Um, I'll probably uh probably
[63:57] do a boring answer and I would just say
[64:02] um anything that has to do with
[64:05] traditional financial assets. Um, you
[64:08] know, I've spent my career helping
[64:10] clients with those traditional
[64:12] investments, anything from mutual funds,
[64:16] uh, you know, down to annuities, life
[64:18] insurance products. I have a background
[64:20] in that. So um you know anything
[64:23] relating to retail financial products
[64:26] cutting Bitcoin completely out of it. Um
[64:29] that has been the focus of my career. So
[64:31] in to the extent that I have subject
[64:33] matter expertise um besides Bitcoin
[64:36] that's what I would say. So it's uh it's
[64:40] kind of a a correlated topic. So maybe
[64:43] it's not a great answer but that's the
[64:44] first one that comes to mind. Yeah.
[64:46] Really cool. I I like that. Um, we have
[64:49] Andrew in the podcast where the previous
[64:51] guest is asking a question for the next
[64:53] guest without knowing who the next guest
[64:55] actually is. Uh, and your question from
[64:57] the previous guest is uh, a very short
[65:00] one, democracy or monarchy. Uh, my
[65:04] answer is it depends on what you're
[65:07] optimizing for and what the underlying
[65:09] society looks like. So in a high trust
[65:13] homogeneous society, I think monarchies
[65:15] have demonstrated effectiveness. um in
[65:18] society with some other characteristics.
[65:21] Uh to quote I forget who it was, maybe
[65:24] Church Hill, democracy is not good, but
[65:26] it's better than all the other
[65:27] alternatives that we've tried. So, uh
[65:31] again, maybe an unsatisfying answer, but
[65:33] it depends. I I I love that. Um there
[65:37] there's like when you talk to financial
[65:40] advisor or uh people that come from uh
[65:43] the res resource educations uh the the
[65:47] sentence it depends on what you're
[65:48] optimizing for like you you have it
[65:51] often in there like that. Uh but it it
[65:54] it really is an important one the the
[65:58] the look of like okay what what are you
[66:01] trying to achieve? Uh uh because a lot
[66:03] of people ask questions and there a lot
[66:05] of people are like okay I want that but
[66:08] what do you like what are you really
[66:09] trying to to achieve? So it depends on
[66:12] what you're optimizing for like that
[66:14] sentence and I and I see it um the the
[66:17] people that come from tradition with
[66:18] finance they usually drop that sentence
[66:20] once somewhere in the podcast. It's a
[66:22] funny observation. Oh it's funny that
[66:24] that's a good question though. It's um I
[66:26] think it's one of those topics that
[66:28] seems like obvious and uninteresting
[66:30] until you learn and think about it and
[66:32] then it becomes fascinating. So that
[66:35] that's a really good question.
[66:37] Absolutely. Really cool. Perfect. And
