[00:00] welcome back to another episode of the
[00:01] robin Z podcast today completely
[00:03] different No guest only a little bit of
[00:06] Bitcoin topics because today I want to
[00:08] show you all the processes all the
[00:10] studio behind the scenes what I do how I
[00:13] do it and yeah just take you a little
[00:15] bit uh behind the usual camera
[00:19] [Music]
[00:22] setup perfect then uh let's get into the
[00:25] studio
[00:31] it's a little bit squeaky uh it's
[00:33] actually from Vienna it's a really uh um
[00:37] popular thing in Vienna having an Al I
[00:40] have no clue what this is in English
[00:42] it's like an
[00:44] old building yeah it's basically exactly
[00:48] that it's an old building so let's come
[00:50] in uh in the studio and the first thing
[00:53] like usually it looks exactly like that
[00:57] uh and it's not as fanc see without the
[01:01] lights without everything turned on uh
[01:04] but uh this is how it usually looks and
[01:07] you can see here uh I have my cap cut
[01:10] open I have my Opus Clips which is
[01:13] really important open and uh yeah there
[01:16] are my lights everything is there but
[01:21] let's switch it on so it actually looks
[01:22] like when I was I would
[01:27] record the first thing that I usually do
[01:29] is turning off the main light the the
[01:32] usual light that I use uh when I shoot
[01:35] stuff then turning this light
[01:39] on uh turning this light
[01:44] on turning the camera
[01:47] on uh turning my boom box on because my
[01:53] PC does not has nice speakers and then I
[01:58] have my background light so it looks
[02:00] also good and that's it like that's all
[02:04] uh all of my studio uh lightings I use
[02:07] two soft boxes and not soft boxes I
[02:11] don't even know how this is called this
[02:13] is just an LED panel uh and yeah the
[02:17] most important stuff uh is uh the
[02:19] background light and for me the the
[02:21] microphone so I can speak nicely I
[02:24] really like that I could put it here uh
[02:27] so I can when I get in the chair here I
[02:30] can nicely talk with my uh guests and
[02:33] it's easy setup like I work every day
[02:37] here uh and recording is just like
[02:40] here's the
[02:41] camera um and maybe you can come here
[02:45] and and film
[02:53] it what I usually do uh is putting
[02:58] because there is my camera so when I
[03:02] look like that I directly look in the
[03:03] camera which is really difficult for me
[03:05] when the guest is there because I want
[03:07] to uh of course look at the guest and
[03:11] want to give him the feeling that I look
[03:13] at the guest so what I do is just make
[03:17] this
[03:19] smaller really
[03:22] small and put it
[03:26] here and here would be the guest so when
[03:29] I sit and speak then I actually look at
[03:32] the guest uh and it's not that far off
[03:35] of the camera so he actually has the
[03:36] feeling that I look at him and as My
[03:40] Philosophy is always being completely
[03:43] transparent uh I just was like let's
[03:46] reveal the whole process how do I invite
[03:48] the guests how does things come together
[03:51] uh and also uh how how how is everything
[03:55] coming together in a way where uh I have
[03:58] no contact of a guest till I have a full
[04:03] episode and I'm in contact with the
[04:05] guest and then I'm publishing everything
[04:07] to this point uh because what you have
[04:10] to know is um when I record with a guest
[04:14] I usually don't have any contact with
[04:16] him before like I have maybe I talked
[04:19] with him on the phone this is really
[04:21] rare honestly um maybe I knew him before
[04:25] already this is even rarer uh and most
[04:29] of the guests that on my podcast I
[04:31] texted with them once or twice or maybe
[04:35] three times or four times uh because of
[04:38] the date of the time uh and maybe we
[04:41] discussed some topics but sometimes we
[04:44] don't even discuss topics I just invite
[04:46] them they're like yeah let's go and I
[04:48] prepare the topics uh
[04:51] and except like maybe two three four
[04:55] guests nobody even wants questions or
[04:58] topics from me they just like H let's go
[05:00] into the the conversation and I just
[05:02] steer the conversation where I thought I
[05:06] think the conversation needs to be uh
[05:08] and how I start is I start always off
[05:12] with uh inviting them so how do I select
[05:17] my guest it's pretty easy when I see
[05:19] someone in the replies uh in on Twitter
[05:23] but also on YouTube now I invited
[05:25] someone from my YouTube comments because
[05:26] he always gives really interesting uh
[05:29] comments
[05:30] and really interesting feedbacks and
[05:32] inputs and I was like let's let's invite
[05:34] him on on on the show on the podcast and
[05:38] I also do that on on Twitter if there's
[05:40] some interesting reply uh if there's
[05:42] something interesting that I see on my
[05:44] feet and I'm like I'm just writing back
[05:47] hey I I love what you said here I love
[05:49] your profile I love whatever uh and do
[05:51] you want to come on the show do you want
[05:53] to join me for an episode uh and that's
[05:56] basically the starting point then I
[05:58] write them a personal
[06:00] message and to my surprise uh most of wa
[06:06] uh and then I sent the personal message
[06:09] and this is my biggest surprise like
[06:12] when I started the podcast I was like
[06:14] who even wants to talk with me like I
[06:17] was I'm I'm I still am um no how should
[06:22] I say
[06:23] it who even wants to talk with me like
[06:26] who wants to come on the podcast or of a
[06:30] non-existing podcast like in December I
[06:33] had zero viewers zero uh listeners uh
[06:37] now I have some now people want to come
[06:39] on the show now it's a little bit more
[06:41] understandable but even in the
[06:43] starting there was no show there
[06:46] was no experience from my side I just
[06:50] started it and people still said just
[06:53] yes like nine out of 10 people said oh
[06:55] yeah let's do it I I want to come on to
[06:58] your show there are some people that
[07:00] rejected but they always said like oh I
[07:02] want to stay Anonymous or stay this and
[07:04] that um and even that I I totally
[07:08] understand and I even put them on the
[07:09] show uh but in the end nine out of 10
[07:13] people say yes and this is fascinating
[07:15] for me because I come from that uh that
[07:17] feat World from that sales world where
[07:21] uh one out of 10 people say yes uh and
[07:24] here in in Bitcoin you just ask them and
[07:27] nine out of uh 10 10 people say uh yes
[07:31] which is really cool and fascinating I
[07:33] love how how amazing this uh Community
[07:37] is the next step uh I try to automize
[07:41] and automate everything as good as I can
[07:45] which is I sent them a link where they
[07:47] can select the date and time which fits
[07:50] them well like the it fits perfect for
[07:54] them and then they automatically get an
[07:55] email with all the details with
[07:58] everything that's going on in that way
[08:01] my whole process is really easy I I just
[08:04] put it out there uh the the link and
[08:07] they can sign up themselves uh and then
[08:10] they get everything uh what they what
[08:12] they want to have uh in that way I don't
[08:15] have to ride back and forth with the
[08:17] different time zones with the different
[08:20] uh timings and his schedules uh it would
[08:22] be without the those calendly uh Google
[08:27] Calendar features that are out there I
[08:30] probably would need I probably could not
[08:32] do once once a day a podcast because
[08:35] it's just not possible uh at this point
[08:38] but uh with those tools with all those
[08:41] AI tools that I use with all those
[08:43] automation tools that I use it's quite
[08:46] possible I need like five six hours per
[08:48] episode and then the the next step of
[08:51] the process uh when once he once we made
[08:55] the contact once we set up an date and a
[08:59] time uh then we
[09:01] usually set up some topics I I I always
[09:05] ask them oh what do you want to talk
[09:07] about is there anything specific that
[09:09] you're passionate about is there
[09:10] anything I should know about you should
[09:13] uh should I listen to any podcast or
[09:15] should I read any articles about you so
[09:17] I get to know the guests uh better uh
[09:20] and then we directly jump to like one
[09:23] two hours before the podcast uh and this
[09:27] is the time where I research like half
[09:30] an hour at least before the podcast I
[09:32] try to research but usually I start like
[09:35] one hour before the podcast to research
[09:37] uh with some bigger guests with some uh
[09:41] because I invite people that have uh not
[09:45] a lot of online presents and I invite
[09:48] people that have a lot of online
[09:50] presents so when there's not a lot of
[09:52] online pres you can you cannot prepare
[09:54] that much so you just go into the
[09:56] conversation and try to figure out what
[09:59] you can say and what's what's good to
[10:01] say with bigger guests uh there's a lot
[10:04] of things going on there a lot of
[10:06] questions you could ask and I try to
[10:08] figure out what are the best questions
[10:10] uh to ask him what are the best things
[10:13] uh for for the viewers to to see from
[10:16] the guest so I get in there we talk
[10:20] sometimes two three minutes before the
[10:22] podcast sometimes half an hour before we
[10:25] start the podcast it depends on on how
[10:28] much uh
[10:30] it it feels natural to talk with the
[10:32] guest uh some also have time limits so
[10:34] they're like hey I have to get off in
[10:36] one hour uh and and we we uh just
[10:41] directly jump in without small talk and
[10:43] this is also something my length of the
[10:46] video sometimes differs a lot like
[10:48] sometimes they are like 40 minutes uh
[10:50] podcast sometimes it's like 1 and a half
[10:52] hours sometimes it's over 2
[10:55] hours and this also depends on the guest
[10:59] like it also depends of course on the
[11:01] topics and how interesting the
[11:03] conversation is uh but often often times
[11:07] it just depends on the guest because he
[11:09] only has one hour time uh or he wants to
[11:12] speak a lot and then we go for like the
[11:14] twoh hour mark I rarely rarely edit
[11:18] anything out so if there's uh any
[11:21] mistakes happening for example the
[11:24] lights fall off of the guest's side the
[11:26] internet connection was uh uh falling
[11:29] off for like a few minutes or something
[11:31] like that then I cut that part out but
[11:34] uh the conversations are pretty rare and
[11:38] just not rare uh the conversation is
[11:41] pretty raw and I just put them out there
[11:43] the only thing that happening and I I
[11:45] will talk about the post production and
[11:47] the publishing process afterwards but
[11:49] it's maybe interesting to know here the
[11:51] only thing that is happening is I put
[11:54] out the small brakes with an AI tool
[11:58] like when there's the one or 2 second or
[12:00] 3 second
[12:01] silence AI tool just sees that and cuts
[12:05] it out all the time now uh to the
[12:07] editing process first of all I have no
[12:09] clue about editing there there are way
[12:12] better people in editing and this is a
[12:13] part that um is probably the first part
[12:17] that I'm looking forward to Outsource
[12:21] I'm still don't feel um comfortable
[12:23] doing that uh step because I need uh two
[12:29] I need to be comfortable with two things
[12:31] I need to be comfortable financially on
[12:33] this whole thing uh and I need to be
[12:36] really comfortable uh with knowing
[12:39] exactly what I want with uh an editor
[12:42] and both things I still have to figure
[12:45] out but this being said uh my process
[12:48] looks pretty pretty easy I uh put the
[12:52] whole thing that I have from Riverside
[12:56] uh I produce Clips with AI tools uh
[12:58] Riverside has some Opus Clips have some
[13:01] there are like a lot of different tools
[13:03] out there that you can use to produce
[13:04] Clips uh when you use Riverside you you
[13:07] basically can just directly use
[13:09] Riverside and from those clips I get
[13:13] ideas from how what parts are most
[13:17] interesting so I get usually like a list
[13:20] of 10 15 20 30 40 clips from the podcast
[13:25] and I look through all of them uh and AI
[13:28] suggests them to me and from those 40
[13:31] Clips I take like the five most
[13:34] interesting Clips or 10 most interesting
[13:35] clips and I see can I put those clips
[13:39] into the trailer in front of the episode
[13:44] or can I put those clips in a short form
[13:47] content that I put out on YouTube shorts
[13:50] on all the platforms on Twitter and
[13:52] stuff like that uh yeah that's that's
[13:54] basically the process of having this
[13:57] podcast distributed uh
[14:00] across platforms and building the trail
[14:03] in front of it then editing the the TR
[14:05] Trail is not really interesting I just
[14:07] use cap cut I cut it out I put some
[14:10] transitions on there I put some effects
[14:13] on there it's it's it's it's nothing uh
[14:16] uh that interesting uh at least for me
[14:20] but maybe that's just uh why I want to
[14:23] Outsource it uh to to to someone who's
[14:26] actually really good in in editing for
[14:28] the last part of this video I want to
[14:31] address a topic that is um quite
[14:34] difficult still for me because when you
[14:36] have so many guests on and you have
[14:39] every day a different guest on and you
[14:41] invite them really quickly because when
[14:44] I see an interesting topic and I see an
[14:46] interesting reply on my feet and I'm I'm
[14:49] like oh yeah let's uh let's take this uh
[14:52] let's uh let's take a conversation uh
[14:55] let's make a conversation out of this I
[14:57] just like someone uh replies to my uh
[15:01] tweet and I see like oh it's an
[15:03] interesting comment uh I want to discuss
[15:05] that on a top on a podcast I quickly
[15:08] check the profile is he a bitcoiner uh
[15:11] then yeah let's get on the call and
[15:13] let's set everything up like as I just
[15:16] explained and there's one point in the
[15:19] Deep research before the recording where
[15:23] I research really deeply on what
[15:25] websites does he link to uh what does he
[15:28] say what does he do uh and what
[15:31] everything that I can see see and there
[15:33] are some guests where I'm like no that's
[15:37] uh that's that's not a good good
[15:40] candidate he is promoting stuff that I
[15:42] don't want to be promoted uh he's making
[15:45] some some scams maybe even he's maybe
[15:48] involved in some uh uh altcoin scam and
[15:51] then I don't want to have him on the
[15:53] podcast um and this is the part where it
[15:57] gets hard to choose what
[16:01] guest is is is worth being on the
[16:05] podcast because I believe really that
[16:09] every ple every bitcoiner deserves a
[16:11] stage and I try to give every Bitcoin
[16:15] andl with my podcast exactly this stage
[16:19] so I don't
[16:21] require you to have a massive following
[16:25] um but to a certain extent I owe it to
[16:27] the few I owe it to the The Listener
[16:30] that the guest is interesting and the
[16:32] guest is not a
[16:35] scammer so that's the balance I have to
[16:37] make and there will be some guests that
[16:40] I invite and then I even record maybe
[16:44] with them that I have to say no we
[16:47] cannot publish this or we we cannot do
[16:49] that till now it did not happen that I
[16:51] had to um cancel a recording afterwards
[16:55] but I think it's just a matter of time
[16:57] till this actually happens um but I had
[17:00] to cancel the recording after we already
[17:02] set a date because I saw that there was
[17:06] something a shady going on there was
[17:08] something uh not going going on and this
[17:10] is I'm also trying to uh just not
[17:14] promote scams at this point that that's
[17:17] that's that's the main thing I want to
[17:20] have interesting conversations with
[17:22] bitcoiners uh about Bitcoin freedom and
[17:25] everything that I talk on the podcast I
[17:28] don't want anyone promoting their scams
[17:31] to my uh to to the Bitcoin audience with
[17:35] that being said uh it was a different
[17:38] one it was a different episode it was
[17:39] also way shorter I don't know how how
[17:42] long it will end up but probably it will
[17:44] be a quick and and short episode uh I
[17:47] will experiment in the future with
[17:49] different forms of content around the
[17:52] podcast and Bitcoin I will make uh usual
[17:57] YouTube talking head videos where I talk
[17:59] like 10 15 20 25 maybe in 30 minutes
[18:02] about one specific topic and dive deep I
[18:06] also want to make how two videos uh
[18:08] about setting up a note setting up multi
[18:11] stuff like that uh because uh I want to
[18:14] explore them myself and making how to
[18:17] video about that forces me to actually
[18:19] learn about that stuff really deeply uh
[18:22] and then I also want to make reaction
[18:24] videos to videos I see online I might
[18:27] even do a reaction video to podcasts I
[18:31] went on so for example when I um as a
[18:34] speaker on as a guest on a different
[18:37] podcast uh I might U react to that what
[18:41] I said there so get to give a little bit
[18:44] more insights to my thinking and to to
[18:47] the guest's
[18:48] podcast uh and and this is basically
[18:50] what I will do in the next couple of
[18:52] months uh uh developing on top of the
[18:56] podcast itself more uh types of content
[19:00] I really appreciate you being here thank
[19:02] you for watching and yeah as always I'll
[19:05] be back tomorrow with another episode
[19:07] bye-bye
