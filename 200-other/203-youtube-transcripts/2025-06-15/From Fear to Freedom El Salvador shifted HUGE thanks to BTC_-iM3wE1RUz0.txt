[00:00] as a woman I had to be look around I had a taser 
I had a paper gas and I I was always afraid but  
[00:08] now I even sleep on the bus when I'm traveling 
you can feel it in the air that it's safe now  
[00:15] you don't see like weird people standing around 
staring at you in Berlin paying for anything is  
[00:21] so easy because you just use blank or your wallet 
you know your lightning wallet and it's done in a  
[00:26] second and like they show you that they receive 
the money and they move on to to help the next  
[00:31] client it's Bitcoin country the country of freedom 
I feel really proud to say I am Salvadorian you  
[00:37] never have enough Bitcoin that's that's the 
easiest question are you both from from El  
[00:43] Salvador no I'm actually mexic okay but you both 
now living in El Salvador um I'm currently living  
[00:53] in Argentina and I was uh ino for like eight 
months or so specifically living in Berlin  
[01:00] yes oh how was how was the experience in berin 
to me it was amazing well I I guess where all  
[01:07] the foreigners that spent time in in Berlin it's 
it's great to be there but for me personally it  
[01:14] was like a life changing experience because 
when I made it to Berlin I knew practically  
[01:20] nothing about Bitcoin and then I leave the town 
and I'm already a bitcoiner and I'm asking my  
[01:26] boss to pay me Bitcoin and everything it all 
happened for me in Berlin so so you came to  
[01:33] Berlin without knowing about Bitcoin so like what 
was your reasoning to to be in beran in the first  
[01:38] place uh I made it there because my partner at 
the time he wanted to be involved in a Bitcoin  
[01:44] project you know in the real world and not just in 
his computer and then he met Evelyn and and herard  
[01:52] and he decided to move to bin in a you know blink 
of an eye um I was with him so we moved to Berlin  
[02:01] and it happened everything going on in Berlin 
for me was Bitcoin related so it was just a  
[02:07] matter of time I was going to end up absorbing 
everything yeah I feel like the the the moment  
[02:13] you get orange build is just the moment you have 
enough information about Bitcoin in your head like  
[02:18] the the more you get educated on on bitcoin it's 
just a matter of time till you actually uh get it  
[02:24] uh but Evelyn you are always in El Salvador 
right yeah born raised in El Salvador yeah  
[02:30] how was it for you did you get orange built before 
the president adopted it with the legal tender or  
[02:37] did did also like this this whole Bitcoin thing 
came came on to you or how was it for you um well  
[02:44] basically I knew about Bitcoin on 2019 so it was 
a little before but I started to like dive deep  
[02:54] into Bitcoin after the law became a legal tender 
here in El Salvador after Bitcoin was legal tender  
[03:01] and because I started to try to get involved in in 
Bitcoin here in El Salvador so I ended up uh given  
[03:09] Bitcoin education here and then we transition to 
this project which which was a circular economy  
[03:18] so that's how basically the transition was by I 
did know about Bitcoin on 2019 now you got with  
[03:28] terado you started this whole Bitcoin Bine Journey 
like next to the things that were with Bitcoin  
[03:34] Beach next to the things that were happening with 
the legal tender uh shado and you uh when I got  
[03:41] it right started the bitco Bine where you just 
like onboarded merchants and also have like the  
[03:46] education on everybody like maybe let's quickly go 
there like how did you and shado start this whole  
[03:53] bit com Bing uh Journey yes as I was mentioning 
we were giving Bitcoin education in El Salvador  
[04:03] and we at the moment we were earning Bitcoin so we 
didn't have a place to to spend it actually and it  
[04:12] was a nightmare to try to withdraw money from the 
ATMs we had to move to a city where there not that  
[04:21] many ATMs and so we tried to find a solution and 
the solution was to create the circular economy  
[04:29] so we started to um try to look for places where 
we could actually leave on a Bitcoin sender and  
[04:41] that's how we came here to Berlin um when we saw 
the city spoke to people we saw the potential in  
[04:50] the city this is a mountain town the weather is 
it's cool at least that if you come compare with  
[05:00] other regions in El salador it's it's cooler 
and so it's a touristic place as well and yeah  
[05:09] that's how we we came with the idea of let's do 
it here and let's try to replicate what um what  
[05:17] happened in lante so we started to talk to people 
in the beginning it was uh hero and me trying to  
[05:24] talk to the businesses we were there first so we 
uh change straty several times until we finally  
[05:32] found that we needed a more friendly approach 
cuz we were like um most more like a regular  
[05:39] bitcoiner trying just to Orange build people 
like up front and and saying hey do you know  
[05:45] about Bitcoin and things like that but um it's 
a little bit different um you have to sort of  
[05:52] become friend friends with people or customers 
they need to get to know you to trust you  
[06:00] somehow and that's how we started to award 
businesses we were the customers who paid in  
[06:06] Bitcoin and in the beginning we were exchanging 
that Bitcoin for Fiat so we were like basically  
[06:13] like an ATM that we came um we came once a week to 
the city we were here like every day but we told  
[06:21] the merchants we are going to be here once a week 
so that they will try to spend it or something and  
[06:30] then after just a short period of time we stopped 
um exchanging money because there were enough  
[06:37] businesses accepting Bitcoin and that happened 
uh at least really fast the first 17th Merchants  
[06:48] I think and people was really excited because we 
were using the maps to showing them um the pins  
[06:57] and that was the huge help cuz we didn't have any 
pin in the beginning so we were showing them look  
[07:04] around or we don't have any any pins in the map 
so you are the first one you are the second one  
[07:09] and you're the third one and so on and so on and 
people was excited to see more more F in the map  
[07:15] and that was a motivation for us too so we kept on 
going and then more people started to get familiar  
[07:23] with what we were doing because we didn't want 
only try to do Bitcoin stuff but we wanted to  
[07:30] help the city and a lot of people they wanted to 
take pride in the city so we started the cleaning  
[07:36] campaigns we tried to get involved with social 
projects here and more people got to join the team  
[07:45] and they were orange bill and they were uh orange 
billing more people and that's how this process  
[07:52] has going on and um also experts that came here 
they have been a huge help and great addition to  
[08:03] to the team I think at the beginning some people 
were they were kind of distrustful some people but  
[08:10] the moment we actually took you know lson hand and 
started being like volunteering for the town and  
[08:16] cleaning things around or like trying to paint the 
park and uh you know anything that they could see  
[08:23] us being involved practically in improving the the 
city that this trust uh it was rapidly gone you  
[08:30] know they changed their minds uh quickly and even 
the people that at the time were not accepting  
[08:35] Bitcoin they were even more welcoming with the 
foreigners and the the whole group because they  
[08:41] knew we were good that it was a good addition to 
the city and not just people trying to like invade  
[08:46] or like you know gentrify uh their space because 
there's normal fear uh in people seeing all these  
[08:53] foreigners coming along and trying to pay in a 
different currency and stuff and the moment they  
[08:58] actually saw us trying to be just another you 
know Bly Nest getting involved that's uh that  
[09:05] was a quick um turnaround for many people to just 
like us and in time they started asking questions  
[09:12] like hey so this Bitcoin thing how does how does 
it this work and uh that was amazing to see like  
[09:18] people who before all of that because Evelyn 
and her they had great ideas to just you know  
[09:24] as the salvadorians they knew how to earn people 
trust and they started dragging all of us to do  
[09:32] the same and of course we we got involved and 
and helped and did the things they um that they  
[09:38] were thinking about that Insight it it was key to 
CH people's mind not only on this wave of people  
[09:47] moving into the town but maybe like thinking 
is this Bitcoin thing something I would like to  
[09:54] include in my daily life is this something I want 
to accept in my business is this something that's  
[09:58] going to improve my life life too because all the 
all all the locals that were already involved in  
[10:04] in in the group they were getting the chance to 
talk to to foreigners and you know get that mix  
[10:10] of culture and adding Bitcoin to their lives with 
all the good things that eat involves of course  
[10:17] you want it in with it right so that helped the 
movement inside Berlin grow in a very organic  
[10:26] natural way all right that's a that's a an amazing 
Insight I also like thought that I as someone who  
[10:34] never was in Salvador never had actually because 
you have a country that has uh uh bitcoiners that  
[10:42] that has just normal regular citizens in there 
that have maybe never or never really heard about  
[10:48] Bitcoin then there is the President coming along 
and having all those great ideas about Bitcoin  
[10:52] and trying to force it on the on the citizens then 
uh you have foreigners coming in more and more and  
[10:58] saying hey Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin and it could 
feel for the citizens that there's just outside  
[11:05] pressure putting something on on us that maybe we 
don't even want which is an interesting fot that  
[11:11] I never had and that's why like uh of course and 
that's why it's also interesting that it started  
[11:18] as an a Grassroots movement in biton beach and 
the whole story with chck malas and then then in  
[11:23] B doing that uh but uh then you also have to get 
on the ground and actually do the hard work to go  
[11:31] to Every Merchant go to every person and and tell 
them why Bitcoin is actually important uh and why  
[11:38] we are doing that it's it's it's it's fascinating 
to see that that change in mind and the change in  
[11:43] the society maybe one year for you is interesting 
also like uh you have been in Argentina now you're  
[11:49] in in Mexico you have been all in different 
places how how different is Al Salvador now  
[11:56] like how how how different was a Salvador in the 
in the eight months did it change and also how  
[12:01] different is it to Argentina Mexico and maybe even 
like I don't know if you have been in in Europe  
[12:06] or the other places how can you compare Sala to 
to other places yes I I have been in Europe uh  
[12:13] uh before uh I think out of all the you know the 
continents is the most different one because it's  
[12:19] the one with the oldest buildings and you know 
all that in Latin America everything is very new  
[12:27] buildings are different um recent structures or 
like you know modern structures as there is in  
[12:34] Europe too but um me's um the very seat country 
now I think uh but as I I now know the Mexican  
[12:45] currency by Fiat standards is a very stable one 
so uh we depend on the dollar a lot if the US  
[12:53] fault I don't think Mexico is going to be able 
to stand for long uh and we have the the safety  
[12:59] issues that really have changed lifestyle for 
many people in the North and the sou south of the  
[13:06] country El saer is a completely safe uh place you 
can walk around with your phone in your hand and  
[13:12] you know for sure nothing's going to happen there 
were plenty of times where I was in a restaurant  
[13:17] and I would leave my phone on the table walk away 
to ask something to the to the wait waitress if  
[13:21] she was busy and I would go back to my table 
and I didn't even think I left my phone in the  
[13:26] table right and I wouldn't do that in AR Ina even 
though it's a safe like relatively safe country I  
[13:32] wouldn't do that here because I know there's not a 
culture like there is in El salador for safety and  
[13:37] responsibility because in El people are actually 
tired of of Del you know of like delinquent and  
[13:44] all of that there's just decent people getting 
by in Mexico there's places where you could like  
[13:53] maybe even not go if you want to be safe maybe 
just don't head that way if you don't know how  
[13:58] to navate those areas right now in Argentina one 
thing I miss the most being here right now and  
[14:05] having spent you know eight months in Bitcoin 
city is paying for anything in Argentina is  
[14:12] a pain you know if you don't have like tons of 
bills like it's just like really it's practically  
[14:20] like 1,000 argentin and pesos is a dollar so you 
have this one bill to pay for like a dollar and  
[14:28] everything I don't know if your bill is 25 ,000 
Argentinian PES you have to take out 25 bills  
[14:35] or like if you have two uh bills like it would 
be like $2 you have to count all those bills to  
[14:42] pay for anything I remember the first time I was 
here visiting uh in February we paid for uh food  
[14:49] at a restaurant and the guy just saw the bills and 
and said like very tired huh just a bunch of paper  
[14:54] huh and rolls his eyes like even they are tired 
in Berlin paying for uh for anything is so easy  
[15:03] because you just use blank or your wallet you 
know your lightning wallet and it's done in a  
[15:08] second and like they show you that they receive 
the money and they move on to to help the next  
[15:13] client and even in Mexico like you can you have 
to wait for your ticket and like bills are not as  
[15:19] much as in in in Argentina or you can pay with a 
credit card and anything but you have to wait for  
[15:24] your ticket and they have to register everything 
in their system and you know there's this whole  
[15:29] ceremony to pay for absolutely everything because 
taxes right and that doesn't happen in Berlin the  
[15:36] best place to go shopping I I would say in the 
world right now it's Berlin because it's so easy  
[15:42] to just have everything in your wallet pay for 
stuff don't be tracked by government if you don't  
[15:47] want to that is such a relief and in Argentina 
it's so different in Europe it's comfortable you  
[15:55] can pay with you know with your bills or you can 
playay pay with your credit card and there's some  
[16:00] Bitcoin accepted or Bitcoin preferred places but 
there are not that many you have to look at them  
[16:06] you have to look for them in the map and right now 
in Mendoza I have been trying to find a Bitcoin  
[16:10] preferred or like Bitcoin accepted uh restaurant 
or cafe or anything sadly whenever I get in touch  
[16:17] or I show up to the plays they're like no we don't 
accept Bitcoin and I'm like okay right but even  
[16:26] you know there's beauty in all places I I love my 
if you ask me Mexico is the best country in the  
[16:32] world even though we'll know it's not Argentina 
is amazing but seriously if because in in El  
[16:38] Salvador whenever you visit you'll see that um 
in the capital even though people know and they  
[16:43] are familiar with Bitcoin it's not easy to find a 
place that accepts Bitcoin but then you move you  
[16:50] go to Berlin and every you practically leave the 
dream of the Bitcoin standard you know real life  
[16:58] that's that's amazing yeah I also heard that a lot 
in in El Salvador it's like El and Bitcoin Berlin  
[17:06] is like the big places where you can spend a lot 
of uh Bitcoin Bitcoin Beach like those are the  
[17:11] places but like even outside probably they just 
just have the problems with the adoption they  
[17:16] have to get to everybody uh like even even though 
it's legal tender Merchants have to be on board  
[17:23] that Merchants don't want to just accept something 
new they have to be educated on stuff like that  
[17:27] so that's that's an inter journey to to to be 
on maybe also the franchises big uh franchises  
[17:36] it's harder for them to accept Bitcoin but when 
you talk to small business owners they might be  
[17:42] more inclined to accept Bitcoin rather than if 
you go to KFC and try to pay with Bitcoin right  
[17:48] yeah that I think that that that's one of the the 
differences or the Highlight points of Berlin that  
[17:56] almost all the businesses are family own it and 
it's easier to find the the owner and talk to them  
[18:05] about accepting Bitcoin whereas if you go to a 
KFC or any other of these big chains you will not  
[18:13] be able to talk to the owner you have to talk to 
the manager and then they have to it's it's like  
[18:19] a chain to get to somebody who make the decision 
yeah so it's it's difficult so and and we felt the  
[18:28] pain last time that we were in s Salvador and cuz 
in Berlin I don't usually I don't have any cash  
[18:35] on me and so we went to this event in in Salvador 
and as always I didn't have money I didn't have  
[18:45] dollars and I we we went to um to buy a um lunch 
and at the time that I had to pay I just realized  
[18:55] I don't have money so I have yeah I have to borrow 
money from somebody to be able to pay cuz they  
[19:02] they were like no we don't accept Bitcoin and as 
much as we tried to talk to them they didn't want  
[19:09] to and that that was a big restaurant a lot of 
foreigners go there because that that place it's  
[19:15] really like touristic but they are not accepting 
Bitcoin and I was like shocked because I I was  
[19:23] I was living there so we just moved to Berlin 
like less than a year ago we were living in s  
[19:29] Salvador and I realized how different it is now 
that I'm I'm used to pay with Bitcoin going to  
[19:38] places where you cannot even in San Miguel it's 
it's hard San Miguel it's 1 hour away from Berlin  
[19:44] and it's hard to find like a lot of places where 
you can spend Bitcoin so as you were saying uh we  
[19:51] need to educate more uh vendors we need more 
Educators in know Salvador because that the  
[19:58] reason why people I think it's um reluctant in 
some way to accept Bitcoin is because of the fear  
[20:05] to the unnown they are afraid to the ups and downs 
of Bitcoin fluctuation there were a lot of scams  
[20:15] so you need to clear out a lot of doubts uh you 
need to give them the tools because not everybody  
[20:22] trusts uh CH wallet for example there there were 
a lot a lot of scams using that particular wallet  
[20:29] um identity stolen and things like that so they 
don't want to use it but they maybe don't know  
[20:35] that there are many other wats that they can use 
and so but we need to keep on educating people and  
[20:42] because I think it's at the when people they get 
familiar with Bitcoin and that that's what we did  
[20:48] in in Berlin some of them they they were afraid 
they didn't trust we just told them just download  
[20:53] the wallet don't use it for the business but try 
to yeah to get familiar we will send the yeah we  
[21:01] we will send you some sets just to test can you 
send it back I'm going to send you again and and  
[21:06] we were doing that like over and over again and 
then they were like just not afraid anymore and  
[21:14] it is just like they started to take Bitcoin 
at least from from some of us uh because they  
[21:20] trust us and they didn't like have that option for 
all the customers but for a few and as they like  
[21:29] seeing Bitcoin stable dollars or that stable sets 
and things like that they that um they lost that  
[21:37] fear that they had um how did it change in the 
last five years and especially when you look out  
[21:44] like I feel like we in El Salvador still in the 
early stages where we are just just now Bitcoin  
[21:50] just came now to El Salvador and and this whole 
new spirit and also nuk is doing a lot of things  
[21:56] uh really good for the cont I think with the free 
passports with bringing bitcoiners and Bitcoin  
[22:01] companies in there like there's a lot of good 
things in addition to bitcoin even with the gangs  
[22:06] and stuff like that but what do you see like how 
did Salvador for you personally change in the last  
[22:11] like five years where you lived there uh and uh 
in what direction do you see as salor going like  
[22:18] in the next years I got that I think that that's 
one of my favorite questions because um there's  
[22:27] a before and after definitely I mean you can just 
uh see it I mean no one can deny it that Salvador  
[22:37] has changed not one single Salvadorian can deny 
it but before um in the matter of security um so  
[22:48] I had as a woman I had to be look around I had a 
taser I had a paper gas and I I was always afraid  
[23:00] um cuz a lot of U my friends I have you know some 
horrible stories of people that it's no longer in  
[23:05] this world and friends of mine but yeah it was an 
nightmare um and so but for woman and and for men  
[23:16] it's it was like hard if uh a guy went to an area 
that he didn't belong the chances are that he was  
[23:25] not going to be out of that place at is alive or 
for a woman something bad will happen to her she  
[23:33] might be alive but something bad will happened 
to her and that was the daily life so it was a  
[23:40] you worrying about am I going to make it alive 
to my house today um I was afraid to to travel  
[23:48] to to come to see my mom because of uh all of the 
gangs and the insecurity but now up I even sleep  
[23:59] on the bus when I'm traveling so that's the kind 
of safety that I feel now and uh in the streets  
[24:08] I mean it's it's all different for us that we 
leave that um gangs uh situation you can feel  
[24:16] it in the air that it's safe now you don't see 
like weird people standing around or staring at  
[24:24] you so it's it's great um to see that change um 
not only that I think that overall El Salvador  
[24:31] has changed uh Bitcoin was a a huge help for that 
because it it helped with tourism so it was as as  
[24:40] the president or the government said it was eing 
because now it's not El Salvador it's the most  
[24:47] dangerous place in the world because of the gangs 
right now it's it's Bitcoin country the country of  
[24:53] Freedom that's you know to me as a Salvadorian 
I feel really proud to say I am Salvadorian I  
[25:02] am really proud when I hear people talking good 
things about El Salvador their experiences here  
[25:10] because before you were only here like most of 
the bad things that happen here and now you see  
[25:17] tourism has increased education I think it has 
a lot of um improved a lot kids because I was  
[25:25] uh giving classes at school and I I was witnessed 
that kids they had a meal per day at least given  
[25:35] by the government and they got tablets they 
got laptops to to help kids to be able to have  
[25:45] a better access to technology education itself 
so it's been great and I think a lot of great  
[25:54] things are going to continue happening with all 
these companies coming to Salvador technology a  
[26:00] lot of uh jobs are going to be created and I see 
a lot of development in Al Salvador within the  
[26:06] next five years and as a salvadorians I think uh 
if more salvadorians are seeing these podcast as  
[26:14] well we need to get involved because this is 
not the job of the government only it is the  
[26:21] job for every Salvadorian every citizen to try 
to make the best of El Salvador not just for our  
[26:29] generation but for the next ones that are coming 
amazing I love it this the story is really cool  
[26:37] because it's first of all the the story that I 
heard from everybody like uh it seemly everybody  
[26:43] agrees on on that that Salvador got so much more 
safe I heard some stories where businesses now  
[26:49] put signs again on on their stores because before 
they were not putting the signs because they were  
[26:55] actually afraid of getting robbed and stuff like 
that and now they put a sign on top and they're  
[27:00] proud to be a business owner and stuff like that 
so like it it seems like there's like a lot of  
[27:05] startup uh spirit a lot of Uprising spirit in 
the El Salvadorian uh uh Community which is  
[27:13] uh it's amazing to to see that and Salvador is 
is improving and that there's a country where  
[27:20] there's now a real world application with Bitcoin 
obviously there's other things also happening in  
[27:26] in Salvador and obviously El Salvador had a a low 
starting place with the murder rate and everything  
[27:32] like they had a lot of room up to improve and now 
they can show how how much it can actually improve  
[27:39] like tourism uh with with the productivity add 
activity for the the businesses will be will be  
[27:46] really interesting and that's why I'm also really 
passionate about uh inviting so many salvadorians  
[27:51] and people that with that background on my 
podcast was when we'll see it in 10 years 15 years  
[27:58] and we can look back in in time and see those 
podcasts ma made by people that were actually  
[28:03] living there and they were just telling what's 
happening and what will happen and this actually  
[28:08] plays out in the long run I feel like that's 
that will be great uh to to see and I'm already  
[28:13] looking forward to clipping from in my podcast 
in 10 years and telling you I told you saw my
[28:19] podcast I'm I'm I'm I'm looking forward to forward 
to that if you listening to this podcast you might  
[28:28] might be wondering what is actually the setup 
look like of Robin or how can I improve my  
[28:33] Bitcoin setup and there's two things you have to 
buy Bitcoin from the right source and you have  
[28:38] to store Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the 
first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a  
[28:44] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with the shitcoin 
exchanges don't deal with an exchange that has an  
[28:49] own token or something like that be on a Bitcoin 
only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is for  
[28:56] me the best partner for for that and now where do 
you store Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a  
[29:02] hardware wallet on a self custody solution where 
you yourself hold your keys and it should be a  
[29:09] cold wallet so that's my Simple Solutions that's 
a bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on there back  
[29:17] up your seat fras and you are better than 95% of 
all Bitcoin harders if you have more than ,000 in  
[29:25] Bitcoin it's an absolutely must have one last 
last thing before we get back to the video I'm  
[29:30] really passionate about meeting other bitcoiners 
and there's an amazing opportunity in middle of  
[29:36] Europe in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's the 
best and biggest Bitcoin only conference in whole  
[29:43] of Europe for all Americans please visit Europe 
and visit this place in tune for all europs it's  
[29:49] a must go anyways you so close to the Bitcoin 
Pride conference you basically have to come I  
[29:55] will do interviews there and I would love to meet 
you all there use code Robin for all my sponsors  
[30:02] to get discounts and use the links down in the 
description and I guess van your experience was  
[30:08] also kind of the same when you were eight months 
in in El Salvador or to what time what what  
[30:14] you was that when you were there uh I made it to 
Berlin in August I think 2023 and I left uh about  
[30:22] a month ago yes uh yeah my experience was the 
same out of all the countries I've been in besides  
[30:28] some in Europe was the one where I felt the safest 
and being Mexican the current uh you know problem  
[30:36] we have with the cartels all over the country 
I Us in Mexico you can experience the same as  
[30:42] Evelyn you know as a woman in certain areas of the 
country places where you don't want to be places  
[30:46] where uh um at certain hours where it's it's not 
convenient as a woman and uh some areas where if  
[30:55] you see someone looking sketchy you're wondering 
am I going to be chased if there's something going  
[30:59] to happen but in elav that completely changes 
and also the people being so I think when I when  
[31:10] I first visited El salador uh in February I think 
or March uh 2023 I saw the people like coming out  
[31:18] of their shells a little bit there were places 
where I would go and there was um I was visiting  
[31:25] this small Lake I forgot the name of it um I was 
I was visiting for the first time and I saw the  
[31:30] Salvadorian uh woman who started talking to me uh 
about you know being Mexican and uh exploring her  
[31:37] country and everything and she told me this is 
my first time here too this is the first time I  
[31:41] visit as well because I had never had the chance 
to actually leave my my my hometown because I was  
[31:46] afraid if they saw I had money they would try to 
extort me in any kind of way and I was shocked to  
[31:51] hear that like wow okay first of all I'm so happy 
that you're here you we're saying this is fre  
[31:58] together and second of all that sucks I'm really 
sorry right like you seeing all these people  
[32:03] changing their lives like that like there were 
some spots where they didn't have that many uh  
[32:08] souvenirs and this lady told me uh I'm sorry I was 
just not prepared for all the foreigners coming so  
[32:15] I don't have that many super like that well this 
is good news things are changing around you'll  
[32:20] you'll be prepared in in the near future wow 
that was seem impressive and also like all the  
[32:26] Curiosity from other Mexicans like wondering hey 
is it really safe over there is it is it really  
[32:32] is it really possible for that to happen to a 
country because we don't know when that could  
[32:37] ever happen to you know to a country like ours 
uh he is very different right now from uh what  
[32:43] it used to be even when I was a girl when I 
was a relatively safe country the only city  
[32:50] that Mexicans were afraid of was Mexico City 
because that was the city where you could get  
[32:54] robbed right like hand gone uh but nowaday is it 
could be almost anywhere seeing as s such a small  
[33:02] country that used to be like the underdog or like 
one of the underdogs in Central and South America  
[33:07] and that's where you see wow this is not uh this 
is possible everything that other uh politicians  
[33:16] say in our country is you know it it's just 
manipulation and lies and excuses you can  
[33:23] make it happen and people in El are very happy 
you can feel the sense of like happiness trust
[33:31] relief something that it's not very common uh 
it's the willingness and the energy to continue  
[33:42] improving their state of their country it's 
not like they're not just sitting in the change  
[33:48] that happened not so long ago they're not like oh 
well it's a safe country now no they're trying to  
[33:52] improve even even further they're like okay this 
is broken how can we fix it this needs improve  
[33:58] how can we make it happen this needs a change and 
even if it is just placing a painting of flowers  
[34:03] on a place to make it look nicer they're making it 
happen I U I was telling Evelyn I think uh at some  
[34:12] point back when I was in a t I told her one thing 
I like about Berlin is that ideas that they don't  
[34:18] just to stay in the air whenever someone wants to 
do something in in in Berlin from what I've seen  
[34:24] most part in El Salvador whenever someone has an 
idea yeah things materialize things happen they  
[34:31] they're not just sitting right like thinking 
and like philosophers and you know in antic  
[34:36] Grace just having great ideas they're actually 
doing these things they're actually executing  
[34:43] the things they want uh to happen that's uh one 
uh like first of all inspiring and second of all  
[34:50] uh admiring uh third of all just uh it fills 
you up with so much energy you end up being  
[34:55] part of it because they're open to anyone willing 
to help they're not just like geping like no this  
[35:01] is my project I do no if you can help join right 
just not get on the way don't don't be uh someone  
[35:10] we going to have to drag just be productive and 
that's something I just love so much about it's  
[35:17] um overall but specifically about Berlin is there 
anything uh or probably there are a lot of things  
[35:25] uh because we we so early in Bitcoin we so early 
in Salvador uh that you would say this needs still  
[35:31] a lot of improvements like is the uh where like 
the the places on the on the the the things that  
[35:37] El salador still needs a lot of uh Room to Grow 
obviously we are early in the Bitcoin game like  
[35:44] adoption is not at 100% uh security is good but 
this can always increased and stuff like that but  
[35:50] is there anything that you or Evelyn can think 
of like you're looking forward to that being  
[35:57] better in like four three five years or something 
like that definely yeah um well that there are a  
[36:07] lot of things that still needs um Improvement and 
I think that I mean uh some of the big changes uh  
[36:17] have to come from the government like uh a lot 
of investment and things like that because uh  
[36:23] we still need to continue to develop education 
um the educational uh system because there are  
[36:31] many many remote areas that still need help also 
Health uh there are a lot of places where that  
[36:42] there's no a hospital in town or it's it is just 
a small um clinic or um unit of healthc care so  
[36:55] I think that those um are like more more details 
that yes needs to be looked at um Education Health  
[37:04] and I think that um access to to the street or 
or public transportation in those areas it's  
[37:13] something that that needs to be looked at like in 
I mean if it's possible in a in a short period of  
[37:20] time that that will be great because there's a 
lot of people that still need help but I think  
[37:25] that overall that we are doing uh fine and 
I think it's it's moving slow but um we are  
[37:34] going step by step yeah yeah I think this this 
is uh some something that is completely normal  
[37:41] and also like I have now a a German friend that 
is now in the process of actually moving to El  
[37:47] Salvador that will be really interesting 
for me to see who who how he like he now  
[37:52] just jumping into there I don't even know where 
actually he wants to move in but he has the black
[37:57] to definitely tell him but let's see 
where he ends up but yeah Berlin is  
[38:07] is is kind of the the obvious choice 
there's also of course elant there's  
[38:11] Bitcoin Beach and stuff like that but uh 
uh like outside is there any other place  
[38:16] like is is is would you recommend outside of 
Bitcoin and of Bitcoin Berlin and elante is  
[38:22] there another place where Bitcoin adoption is 
like is it number three is that number three  
[38:28] by Flores but I it's aapan it's the other place 
where it at something it's starting to to be  
[38:37] created um as of right now I think El sun and 
Berlin are the places with more adoption but it  
[38:45] will depend on what people like cuz uh for example 
some people they like the beach so they they  
[38:52] have the option to go to Sante if they like the 
mountains they have the option to come here and  
[38:58] and live in a Bitcoin standard there's people that 
they love the city and so for that s salador is is  
[39:06] the best place there are a lot of uh businesses 
except in Bitcoin not as many as uh probably here  
[39:14] but definitely not not as many but um yeah I mean 
you can find find ways to to make a living and  
[39:23] yeah in regards to to bitcoin adoption I think 
these two and some that are trying to to erase  
[39:30] right now okay okay really cool um before we get 
to the end routine on the end uh um questions for  
[39:37] for my podcast um I have one more question this 
is more like a personal question for my uh podcast  
[39:44] because I've seen my statistics and I'm watching 
them carefully and I've always seen one statistic  
[39:51] that is completely out of order that's I only have 
like five or six% uh female listeners and Watchers  
[39:59] like my audience is completely just male or not 
just but five 95% yeah a massive maurity in male  
[40:07] and when I go to bitcoin meetups it's also like 
that if I go to bitcoin conferences it's also kind  
[40:12] of like that as in Europe at least I don't know 
how it's in El Salvador in Mexico Argentina if  
[40:18] there's a difference there it's probably probably 
the same uh um two questions like why do you think  
[40:25] is like that and and how uh how do we mean can 
can we change it or is that some is this just  
[40:32] a natural progress that will take care of its 
own because everybody will have Bitcoin anyways  
[40:38] at some point and then we are at 50/50 I have so 
many thoughts on this so I'm going to let hn take  
[40:44] the floor yeah no I think that um so in in the 
majority of the fields it's same men more mostly  
[40:53] when it's something technical it's it's more 
like that cuz I I used to work for so many um  
[41:00] technical companies and all of my co-workers most 
of them were were men we were like a few women  
[41:06] but I think that um the change will will happen 
slowly and but to me um I find really interesting  
[41:18] to combine knowledge with emotions that's how I 
do things and I think that that has help help me  
[41:27] to be able to get involved in a lot of fields that 
only it's dominated by men and um because I try to  
[41:37] get the knowledge I like to share the knowledge 
and I think that you we as a woman uh we tend  
[41:44] to to be more emotional right so I try to find 
how these can will benefit me and will benefit  
[41:54] more people um so that I can share this knowledge 
that's why I'm going to learn it because I want to  
[42:00] share the knowledge with other people and that's 
what what's taken me to where where I'm going um  
[42:07] and I always try to to learn at least the basic to 
understand what I'm teaching people and um I think  
[42:17] yeah uh the change will happen slowly there's a 
saying that Bitcoins get to you uh at the time  
[42:25] that it has to so don't rush it because eventually 
that people will get there it is just a matter of  
[42:33] paying attention yeah van yeah I I agree 100% with 
uh what Evelyn said I'm not you know an expert  
[42:43] on bitcoin when it comes about the technical side 
but what got me involved in in this and what I was  
[42:49] interested the most at uh from the beginning was 
the philosophy and the lifestyle behind it right  
[42:56] the congren with uh what the currency represents 
within the economy system with you know not living  
[43:05] that just to occur you know just monetary side of 
it but to apply it to the rest of your you know  
[43:11] all the other aspect of your life I'm sorry that's 
what uh made me uh take an interest in it from the  
[43:19] beginning and I think the more it takes on the 
more we spread you know that word as Jehovah's  
[43:27] W Witnesses like have you ever heard about this 
different lifestyle that could actually improve  
[43:31] your life and you know help you break away from 
all the culture that is dragging your life into  
[43:36] this dark hold of you know of horrible things 
going on there's plenty of people because it  
[43:44] happened to me right there's plenty of people 
who are trying to improve their lives but they  
[43:48] just don't know how and many of them are being 
told there's just no way out you have to become  
[43:54] this horrible person in order to or like you have 
to to like seclude yourself from the group and  
[44:00] everything but they just don't know that there's 
there's other side of uh you know there's this  
[44:05] group group of people who are already on the other 
side living a different life uh and improving you  
[44:12] know everything around them just by adopting this 
different lifestyle and I think this philosophy  
[44:19] and mindset uh trying to spread it on it's what's 
going to get of course more women involved into  
[44:27] this because when I was first introduced to 
bitcoin I was um explained all the technical  
[44:34] side of it and I was like colde fantastic right 
like I didn't care but when I got involved in  
[44:40] the community and then everyone started explaining 
to me like the small businesses and you know they  
[44:45] talk to you about the story and then you hear 
all this bitcoiners talking about the important  
[44:49] things no one is really addressing in a normal 
feat you know table at a restaurant then you're  
[44:54] like who okay this is this is interesting and 
then it happens right so yeah maybe lots of women  
[45:02] right now are not going to pay attention to the 
technical side of it because that comes in time  
[45:09] but to start actually hearing uh the red orange 
peling side of it that can uh slap something into  
[45:18] people's brains that makes yeah 100% really we I 
mean in general I think we have to make a better  
[45:26] job in educating people in general uh because 
people don't understand Bitcoin and when you're  
[45:33] deep into the RIT hole and when you deep into the 
education learning things you are speaking with  
[45:41] words that other people don't understand and 
if you mention like two three four words that  
[45:46] the other person that you're speaking to doesn't 
understand then they will not listen to you like  
[45:51] you have to be speak in a really simple language 
I got it I saw it with so many friends of mine  
[45:57] once I start mentioning words that doesn't not 
make sense for them they just don't listen like  
[46:03] and often people don't want to ask the question 
like oh what is that because they are embarrassed  
[46:09] that they don't know uh things about that so 
that's why we have to be as an educator as as  
[46:14] someone that explains to to other people always 
be like okay what what if does he understand that  
[46:22] did he understand that should I explain it more 
like should I even use that word maybe I should  
[46:26] Des Des cribe it differently like that's why we 
we can always make a better we can always make a  
[46:31] better education and that's that's the key to 
to the Bitcoin adoption in the end of the day  
[46:35] if we can explain it well and if you can explain 
it in a good way and get it to as many people as  
[46:41] possible then we will succeed other otherwise not 
but I think we we will succeed we we have a lot  
[46:47] of bright Minds in the bit need no I think that go 
ahead sorry yeah know I was just going to say that  
[46:56] I think that we um empathy has a lot to do with 
it um as I was giving Bitcoin education to kids  
[47:05] you need to find a way to really get to them 
because you will not talk to kids like have you  
[47:12] noticed that when you go to the supermarket you 
buy less now so they don't they they don't don't  
[47:20] they don't do that so you need to talk candies for 
them you need to make examples that they that it's  
[47:27] according to their life and it's the same for if 
you if you're going to talk to a grandma if you're  
[47:32] going to talk to a Salesman if you if you're going 
to talk to people that they don't know how to read  
[47:39] they don't know how to write because we have that 
here too and you need to talk to them according  
[47:46] to their reality so that they can understand 
what you're talking about and why Bitcoin is  
[47:54] important not talking about uh the coding inside 
of but what will do Bitcoin to change your life  
[48:02] and your family's life in um in the present and 
in the future because uh for example with with  
[48:09] people who has kids parents are always worried 
about the future of their kids so you you have  
[48:17] to know what buttons to push in order to get 
people's attention yeah that's uh that's very  
[48:26] very true um and I love it man you wanted to say 
something before though uh uh I was just going to  
[48:34] say think the technical side of Bitcoin comes in 
time once uh you start getting to understand uh  
[48:41] the social part of it and um the economical side 
of it and then you get more deep into the rabbit  
[48:47] hole that's when you stumble upon I think in my 
case with the technical side and then you make  
[48:51] an effort to understand and especially when you 
start messing you know like playing around with  
[48:56] the apps and trying to move SATs from one place 
to the other and then that's when you have like  
[49:02] a little bit of more technical questions to try 
and do that from the beginning that's when you can  
[49:06] lose people in in the aring process again as EVN 
so very rightfully just said do you have to know  
[49:15] what buttons to push and not to people to start 
understanding and seeing how that applies into  
[49:22] their lives otherwise yeah it's nearly impossible 
to get them involved yeah we we have to keep it  
[49:31] as as simple as possible I mean I myself I 
know that last year I got for the first time  
[49:38] ever utex o management this is something I never 
thought about before like I was like you take so  
[49:44] management what what do you mean like I stack SATs 
and keep it in my wallet like what what should I  
[49:50] do there uh and but yet last year I learned that 
is a thing and I made a few weeks ago as special  
[49:57] episode with vicet from from tter around UT takes 
o management and we talked I think one and a half  
[50:02] hours about that topic and it was just scratching 
the surface because we wanted to make it really  
[50:08] easy and understandable and approachable is it's 
like this episode that I can now send to everybody  
[50:14] who ask me what do you T home management why is 
it important why should I take why should I take  
[50:19] care of it I was three years in Bitcoin I was two 
years all in in Bitcoin and I only had Bitcoin and  
[50:26] never was thinking of what is UT management so 
so that's kind of embarrassing but now I know  
[50:34] so with time we with time we learn yes just give 
it time exactly perfect then uh before we come to  
[50:45] the uh official end routine I have a inofficial 
end routine that I kind of started in the last uh  
[50:52] few episodes where I asked the uh guest uh what 
are the really passionate about which we didn't  
[50:59] talk on the podcast till now like maybe start 
with with ba um what are you currently really  
[51:06] passionate about what are you learning what are 
you doing uh outside of Bitcoin outside of what  
[51:12] we talked about well right now I'm very focused on 
completing the training for the new job I just got  
[51:20] when I'm working with um with Steve which is like 
I would call him one of the benefactors or like I  
[51:25] don't know uh of the Bitcoin Center in Berlin and 
I'm working with him uh at a you know remotely so  
[51:32] I'm really focused on that right now and I'm also 
trying to I'm I really like cooking so I'm trying  
[51:39] to get involved into learning how to cook eat 
Argentinian style because um in me we have our  
[51:46] own way to do it and I I was lucky enough to see 
how they do it in theer but argentinians have a  
[51:52] very well earned reputation of really knowing how 
to make you know as sads and like the grill and  
[51:59] everything so I'm trying to get involved in that 
right now and it's been it's been been amazing I  
[52:04] bit eting a lot but yeah that's U cooking right 
now it's what I'm passionate about besides just  
[52:10] par and and Bitcoin and my job perfect everyn 
uh well I have to to thing that well I'm I'm  
[52:20] working on my office right now um yeah decorating 
my office cuz I have a new office and that that's  
[52:29] my focus right now seeing what can I do with with 
space but aside of that I have a passion um it's  
[52:38] not a hobby it's it's something that it it really 
fills my heart and it's that I like to feed and  
[52:46] help straight dogs and yeah anybody who knows me 
will tell you that I'm always hearing like dog  
[52:55] food and things like that so that that's something 
that um makes me feel that I'm alive for something  
[53:03] and yeah so that those are in in in plans I love 
plans I have my house full of plans I steal plants  
[53:13] from the street I got that I I've been stealing 
plants too you can't see them right now uh but  
[53:23] I've been stealing plants too to like try and big 
my apartment I just moved here I learned that from  
[53:29] Evelyn just randomly like cuton pieces of plants 
I can tell are going to grow right if you like  
[53:36] put them on dirt or like water then that it works 
great deoration technique just take plants from  
[53:45] random places if you like them and something 
eving is the cutest thing but um sometimes in  
[53:53] some parts of Berlin dogs recognize her and they 
chase her around the city like just like walking  
[54:00] behind her like protecting heav the cutest thing 
ever there's my they say when they see me that's  
[54:11] that's very GL getting the the whole Security 
in with with with with uh darkg food very yeah  
[54:21] yeah it's a it's a it's a thing that's needed 
I don't think many people like they think about  
[54:27] dogs and they think about animals but not that 
many people maybe because they can't like I'm  
[54:32] not judging anyone but not that many people get 
act they get actively involved in helping dogs or  
[54:38] like any animal in the street and everything dot 
so it's just quite an example to follow amazing  
[54:46] I mean in Austria never saw in Austria actually 
never saw maybe I don't open my eyes enough but I  
[54:55] think I never saw a street dog like a dog without 
the things and like I think almost all the dogs in  
[55:02] in Austria like kind of somewhere and they're like 
big centers where where uh the street dogs come  
[55:09] uh like if if if someone finds a street dog then 
they they guide them to to the places where they  
[55:13] at least get some shelter and some food I once 
had an experience with a dog who I thought was  
[55:20] a street dog uh and and I was like seeing him and 
I was like he doesn't have he doesn't has anything  
[55:28] and I was like okay let's let's let's go in here 
and see if he has anything then I was like oh okay  
[55:33] he probably is with the farmer because there a lot 
of big farmers like like a really rural place and  
[55:38] then I was walking with just away from him and he 
was following me for like half an hour 45 minutes  
[55:45] and and and I was like I didn't didn't want to 
get rid of him because I was like maybe he has  
[55:49] actually no owner uh and then I was coming home 
and my mom actually knew from from where he was
[55:58] but you were taking
[55:59] that does that count kidna kind I didn't short 
I like I think he just expected food so lovely  
[56:15] yeah know we we need um shelters here in 
Elanor so that's one of the things that  
[56:21] we can also improve here because yeah yeah it 
will be great to not have straight straight  
[56:26] dogs that would be awesome for them and in time in 
general Y in time one thing right before we leave  
[56:36] I think one thing it's very important for me to 
mention to anyone who's thinking about moving to  
[56:40] Berlin is that all the experts living in Berlin 
right now they are um becoming berlines they go  
[56:49] you know when in Rome do as a Romans everyone UHS 
they all get actively involved in the activities  
[56:56] of the town the festivities rules traditions 
and all the ETC that comes with immigrating to  
[57:02] another country because I know we call ourselves 
experts but we're actually immigrants right so  
[57:08] and I say this because being Mexican I saw in 
uh since I was a kid uh locals being kicked out  
[57:16] of their Homeland because foreigners moved there 
and gentrification in my country has hurt locals  
[57:23] greatly that is not happening in Berlin it's quite 
the opposite the lives of the locals are improving  
[57:32] and whoever moves there they need to know I think 
G tropication is not happening in Berlin the town  
[57:39] is the Salvadorian town that accepts you know 
it's a Bitcoin City but it's in Salvador in  
[57:44] town and for for a foreigner there's always a 
local there's always an you know an equivalence  
[57:52] there's never like the majority of foreigners 
and then there's no Salvadorian there's always  
[57:56] is a Salvadorian and they're asking for 
a translation because they're involved  
[57:59] in what's happening whenever someone you know 
if they go visit just know yes you're welcome  
[58:04] you every you know all the etceteras of moving 
there but um locals are just as important if not  
[58:11] more I think that's something great about what's 
happening in Berlin it's a in Mexico we say me  
[58:18] Mexico for the Mexicans it didn't really happen 
but it's happening in Berlin Berlin is for the  
[58:25] berlines so if you go there become one I think 
also a part of it is is actually just learning  
[58:32] the culture and the language I think is also a 
big part because not every everybody is uh can  
[58:37] can speak Spanish so it's like a big part of just 
learning the local language getting in touch with  
[58:43] them uh you don't have to be an an Spanish expert 
at day one I think but it it helps to be just  
[58:49] like Curious and and learn every day and and try 
and effort like I but this is general like just  
[58:56] like getting in a new country getting used to 
their culture getting used to their festivals  
[59:01] getting used to their routines uh participating 
with that and also like just like be being if you  
[59:08] move somewhere that's a big commitment also show 
that big commitment to the other person like it  
[59:13] say for me it's normal normal human behavior 
but unfortunately it's not normal that's how  
[59:20] let's get to the end routine of the podcast uh 
where we have one question from the previous  
[59:25] guest for the next guest and uh you you can 
choose uh you can both uh give an answer to  
[59:31] if if you want your Bitcoin and the question is 
once your Bitcoin stack gets to a level you are  
[59:37] satisfied with what would you do better in 
the world probably Evelyn would build a dog
[59:45] shelter yeah yeah no I I don't think 
you need to wait until that point  
[59:56] because you never have enough Bitcoin that's 
that's the easiest question to say like to  
[60:02] satisfactory level I was told you never have 
enough Bitcoin how much do you have not enough not  
[60:10] enough yes that's the answer but yeah I mean with 
with the possibilities I will just try to do more  
[60:19] social activities and activities that cannot only 
benefit in in the present time that but can last  
[60:27] longer in the future yeah maybe maybe do something 
for for the straight dogs and not I mean like to  
[60:36] run a problem not not just the shelter because 
the shelter will not fix the that the situation  
[60:42] it will just fix it for the ones that will be in 
the shelter but not for for every dog so I will  
[60:47] just try to run a program to prevent people from 
releasing dogs to the Street Van uh guess I would  
[60:56] try and build this Center to help uh single women 
who are struggling with maternity especially young  
[61:03] women play that provides education all type of 
education that's uh needed not just Financial  
[61:09] education like maybe even help them with uh you 
know maternity information because that's not  
[61:15] always available and um you know a place that 
doesn't really discriminate based and pass or  
[61:22] anything maybe not like in offerit or something 
like that but um just a sh um like a shelter like  
[61:30] place where women can find uh they help needed 
there's lots of single mothers in Mexico and  
[61:38] in southern Central and South America so I I'd be 
interested in trying to help improve their lives I  
[61:49] I love it uh and this is also a great ending point 
I love I love the conversation with with the both  
[61:55] of you I think it was also really good that we 
like that both of you were in the same podcast
