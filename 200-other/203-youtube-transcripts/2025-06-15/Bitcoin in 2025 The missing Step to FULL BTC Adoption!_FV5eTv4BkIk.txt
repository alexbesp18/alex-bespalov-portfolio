[00:00] all those AIS are going to be getting paid in 
Bitcoin it doesn't really make sense for an AI  
[00:04] to be taking US Dollars over here and rupees 
over here it just makes sense to have one  
[00:09] currency that's what Bitcoin is every Bull 
Run we've had had distractions in the past  
[00:13] it's been altcoins it's been FTX this B run is 
going to be micro strategy maybe some altcoins  
[00:19] when we at a million dollars in Bitcoin I think 
this is the moment where the general population  
[00:25] will actually wake up even if you got to one 
Bitcoin and even if the price is a million do  
[00:30] but you still have to go to work every day 
and do a 9 to-5 job for somebody else that  
[00:34] you don't necessarily love doing I wouldn't 
consider that a success within the next 5 or  
[00:38] 10 years I believe that we're not even going 
to know what the price of Bitcoin is there's  
[00:42] three things that have to happen in order for us 
to get there the first one in my eyes was Wall  
[00:47] Street when the biggest money in the world can 
flow into Bitcoin and have access to that this  
[00:52] asset that's a big deal and that that's when 
everything changed in January 2024 second one  
[00:56] is strategic reserve for the US it doesn't really 
make sense to announce that they're going to do  
[01:00] it and then let everybody else front run them 
so I think the more accurate thing is going to  
[01:04] be early 2025 Trump's going to do an executive 
order and write it into law that they're going  
[01:09] to start their strategic reserve and that's 
going to create such fomo around the world  
[01:13] for nation states every country is going to 
have to compete with that and then the third
[01:17] one H how did you start hello there we are on the 
air is is that yeah hello out there uh beyond the  
[01:30] air I I saw some videos I told you yesterday 
I usually take like the transcripts of some  
[01:35] videos that I find and put it out there so in my 
preparation I heard like five six times behind  
[01:41] like hello out there we on there that's actually 
uh that's not mine I can't take credit for that  
[01:46] that's uh Stomping Tom Connors he was a very 
famous Canadian artist and he used to do the  
[01:53] introduction for Hockey Night in Canada here and 
that's how his uh he had a song called the hockey  
[01:58] song and that's how his started said hello out 
there we're on the air it's hockey night tonight  
[02:05] oh so you took it from song yeah so he he's an 
icon here in Canada stomp Tom he's dead now he  
[02:10] died about five years ago I think but that's 
where so that's kind of just a tribute to him  
[02:15] oh nice so so he did songs and what what did he 
do like how did he became an icon um just uh I  
[02:22] think he was from the east coast to Canada he had 
a bunch of really famous songs um the hockey song  
[02:28] was probably his most famous one because they 
used it on like uh Hockey Night in Canada here  
[02:33] which was a big thing Saturday nights they 
played there usually two Canadian teams in  
[02:38] the NHL playing against each other and so they 
would do Hockey Night in Canada and he would be  
[02:42] the introduction to it hello out there we're on 
the air so that's where it comes from really cool  
[02:48] yeah and we recorded yesterday actually uh the 
same thing just like you interview me uh on your  
[02:55] channel for the people that are listening to this 
now when it's gets published it's probably like a  
[03:00] week behind or something like that uh and it was 
really fascinating for me because I think it was  
[03:05] the first podcast episode or like interview that 
I did where we started off with EI and not Bitcoin  
[03:13] that that was really cool um so I was like yeah 
let's let's start also with with your AI take  
[03:19] especially if you think AI has any any impact on 
on bitcoin that's honestly what I'm most excited  
[03:26] about for the AI stuff is how it's going to tie in 
so well with Bitcoin it just makes so much sense  
[03:32] Bitcoin is a currency of the internet AI is going 
to use the internet for everything I think even  
[03:37] though there's there's people like me people like 
you who are kind of Dipping our toes into it I  
[03:42] don't think we've seen anywhere near the potential 
of what's going to come with it and I I see in the  
[03:49] next you know it'll probably happen happen faster 
than I think but in the next five years I think  
[03:55] there'll be a lot of jobs that are replaced by Ai 
and I think all those AI I are going to be getting  
[04:01] paid in Bitcoin it doesn't really make sense 
for an AI to be if it can do a job for anybody  
[04:06] in the world it's not going to be taken US Dollars 
over here and you know rupes over here you know it  
[04:13] just makes sense to have one currency that's what 
Bitcoin is it's a Global Currency on the internet  
[04:19] and it's it's going to fit so well into that so I 
guess kind of my my take on it is I'm very excited  
[04:27] I think even though there will be a lot of jobs 
replaced I think it'll be the jobs that I I think  
[04:33] as you said yesterday it's it's the people that 
are using II who are going to be replacing the  
[04:38] jobs not AI themselves the people who can who can 
really put it into practice learn the skills now  
[04:44] so when that time comes and and a lot of people 
are already you know really going hard on it right  
[04:49] now and I think they're going to it's going to 
pay them major dividends in the coming years as  
[04:53] we transition into that future absolutely and it's 
also it's interesting when I think about eii eii  
[04:59] is getting paid and Eis paying other Eis um I 
I still have a hard time rubbing my head around  
[05:07] that because right now it's like yeah you have 
the AI tools but it has to be interative with a  
[05:11] human being so the human being is basically 
inputting and getting output out of the AI  
[05:16] and and he the the human being gets paid for 
that uh and not directly the AI so so you also  
[05:22] imagine there's like just an an an AI that has a 
website and you throw things in there you pay for  
[05:30] for that and that naturally should be Bitcoin 
because yeah like the internet rails of the field  
[05:36] system is quite bad or how do you imagine that 
that future yeah I think that's exactly right  
[05:42] and I think that they already kind of exist I 
played around with it a little bit myself in  
[05:46] terms of like they're called AI vending machines 
so just just think of like a vending machine where  
[05:52] you can choose like a chocolate bar BGA chips 
cookie you put some money in there and you get  
[05:58] it with a AI vending machine you can do the same 
thing so you can say you know this is an image  
[06:03] generator this is a transcript generator this 
AI does this and there's going to be competing  
[06:08] AIS for each job that you want to do and some 
of them will be 100 SATs some of them will be  
[06:13] 200 SATs some of may be a million SATs if it's a 
big job that there's only certain AIS that can do  
[06:20] that job but it looks like a vending machine 
kind of obviously not you know in real life  
[06:24] but you can choose uh what you want to do and 
then choose the best AI and based on the rate  
[06:30] the budget that you have for it so other than 
the fact that AI can't get bank accounts like  
[06:35] they can't go to the bank and you know provide 
verification that this is I am an AI but just  
[06:41] the fact that it'll be micro payments I think 
that's that's kind of the key part to it is  
[06:45] that it wouldn't really make sense for me to hire 
an AI on an AI vending machine for 30 cents the  
[06:52] Fiat rails do not facilitate that you know because 
you have to involve my bank your bank the people  
[06:59] in between for 30 cents that that's kind of what's 
been holding the internet back for so many years  
[07:04] is just the ability to do micro payments and 
that's what bitcoin's going to facilitate it's  
[07:10] it's in general like the the micr payments and 
the possibility to stream SATs and do SAP that  
[07:17] that that's I think something that is still 
overlooked even by the majority of bitcoiners  
[07:23] that they don't get like how how insane this 
is that we can pay a fraction of a fraction of  
[07:29] a scent uh to each other per second uh before 
watching a podcast or whatever like that that that  
[07:38] that should have a major impact on on on Society 
on payments how business is done how do you how do  
[07:44] you imagine that well I think that Noster is one 
of those things I know you're a Noster guy and  
[07:50] you've seen kind of the potential that's there so 
far it's very small it's very young there's lots  
[07:55] of work that needs to be done on it but in terms 
of microp payments like it's very easy to it's I  
[08:00] always love comparing Bitcoin to everything and 
you can just see how much better it is in the in  
[08:04] the system that we're moving into but like if you 
compare Noster to Instagram for example there's a  
[08:10] lot of influencers on Instagram they make a lot 
of money through ads they have to take money in  
[08:14] from other companies they have to promote products 
they have to spam people some of them goes against  
[08:20] their values some don't but on Instagram you can 
like a photo you can share it to your story you  
[08:26] can leave a comment that helps a little bit but it 
it's very Fiat it's very illusionary not you don't  
[08:30] get any sort of value in exchange for that whereas 
if you put a post on Noster and instead of giving  
[08:35] a like I send you 21 SATs that's meaningful 
that's value that I can send that I could not  
[08:40] do on Instagram or any other platform but with 
micro payments that's what it facilitates so it  
[08:45] unlocks a whole worldwide economic Marketplace of 
people to be not only competing to post the nicest  
[08:52] picture but for graphic designers for accountants 
for writers for ghost writers for anybody now  
[08:59] it unlocks the whole worldwide marketplace with 
Bitcoin in in the sense of either micro payments  
[09:06] or sending Bitcoin that we couldn't do before like 
just think about 10 years ago if you wanted to  
[09:11] hire somebody in Kazakhstan to build your website 
for you it's pretty tough first of all you have  
[09:18] to find them which is I mean the internet kind of 
facilitated that but then I'd have to get their  
[09:23] banking information I'd have to find a payment 
system that works for me and for them there'd  
[09:29] be a lot of fees probably in that I might have to 
go to a Western Union to send them cash like it's  
[09:34] archaic but but there's people on the other end 
of that that transaction who are willing to work  
[09:39] who are wanting to work who have never been able 
to participate in the global economy yet until  
[09:46] Bitcoin so it's going to unlock everything and 
then you think of like just going back to Noster  
[09:51] for a sec you think of a guy like Morgan Wallen 
who's huge like huge on the Internet or Taylor  
[09:59] let's use Taylor Swift more people are probably 
familiar with her instead of putting a song out  
[10:03] on Spotify where people listen to she gets a very 
small cut from Spotify she can put an exclusive  
[10:10] brand new song on Noster and instead of people 
liking and commenting and following her they can  
[10:17] actually send 21 SATs or 2,000 SATs when when one 
big artist does that and and other artists see the  
[10:25] capabilities now that this is possible it's it's 
going to change everything and we're we're kind  
[10:30] of still in the transition phase right now but 
I think in in the future you know people who are  
[10:35] only on Spotify or apple music that's just going 
to be a complete thing of the past where they're  
[10:40] really locked in on that contract and they're 
getting just like fractions of what they're worth  
[10:44] this unlocks the global it unlocks people's real 
potential and that's for Taylor Swift but that's  
[10:50] going to be you know a girl that lives down 
the block can do that too now without a record  
[10:54] label without any of that kind of stuff that we 
had in the old system so it's it's incredible  
[11:00] it's it's truly is and it it just opens your 
mind like there there's so many things so many  
[11:05] small things in there first of all like the uh 
integration of proof of work as you mentioned  
[11:10] with Instagram you just like send an uh an digital 
like which means L literally nothing because like  
[11:18] it's just a press of a button uh and if you 
actually send sabs obviously like if it's like  
[11:23] five sets or 10 sets or 100 sets it's not a lot 
of money but it's actually proof of work Le it's  
[11:29] actually energy that you send to that other uh 
person and then also taking out the middleman of  
[11:37] everything Bic that that's Bitcoin like it takes 
out the middleman of the banking system where the  
[11:42] central bank is doesn't uh interfere with with the 
money supply but it also takes out the middleman  
[11:47] of of the payment rat we don't need a Master 
Card for that we don't need all the thousands  
[11:52] of thousands layers in between and the the third 
thing that you mentioned that is really big was  
[11:57] the fact that you can transact with someone from 
Austria and Kazakhstan or like America and Russia  
[12:04] it doesn't matter where you are because it's just 
like a protocol and uh that that is so huge for  
[12:11] me and the other part too you said the banks the 
payment systems but also the middleman including  
[12:17] like the record labels that's a middleman and 
now I mean there there's probably bitcoiners and  
[12:24] there's there's artists out there who are living 
in AER and Bitcoin in this this world already  
[12:28] they're they're kind of building their foundation 
and getting ready for what's coming but in the  
[12:33] past if you wanted to record an album or if you 
wanted to record a song you'd have to go through  
[12:36] a a record label where they would keep I mean 
we've seen the horror stories from record record  
[12:41] labels and how much money they actually keep and 
and basically just Rob the actual artist the one  
[12:47] who's actually doing the work and has the talent 
that that's gone now if I wanted to upload a song  
[12:52] I could use AI I could put in some lyrics they 
could spit out a song for me I could upload it  
[12:58] without record label without spotify's permission 
and if people like it I get instantaneous feedback  
[13:05] from that and if people like it that could go you 
know I don't know if the radios would play it or  
[13:09] not but I could still earn you know substantially 
more than what what's available out there for the  
[13:15] artists and and creators like that it's hard to 
imagine how huge the impact of AI plus Bitcoin  
[13:23] plus decentralized media like Nostra is it's it's 
I never thought of like that that Trio that that  
[13:30] combo of of things together Ai and Bitcoin yes and 
Bitcoin with decentralized media but all the free  
[13:37] things together it's it's kind of fascinating and 
close my mind what's possible but you also I think  
[13:43] need those right and even just to take it one step 
further like we're we're going to be uploading  
[13:47] this onto YouTube but we're going to a place where 
we're not going to need YouTube where they're not  
[13:52] going to be able to say Hey you you're not allowed 
to talk about this or you know here's a strike you  
[13:58] can't earn money this this month whereas if I if 
I upload it to Noster and people like it there's  
[14:04] no ads there they're just giving me value I mean 
the circular economy the value forv value economy  
[14:09] has been kind of buzzwords around Bitcoin and 
Noster for a while but it's going to turn into  
[14:14] something pretty real here I think uh sooner than 
sooner than we think so it's the people who are  
[14:19] building things right now in the attention economy 
the creators right now the artists the people who  
[14:25] are kind of building their their Foundation 
right now even though it's been very painful  
[14:31] for the last couple years uh especially if you're 
counting on like value forv value SATs uh to put  
[14:38] food on the table but that that's the suffering 
and the sacrifice that people have have made up  
[14:43] until this point they're going to be light years 
ahead of everybody else who's going to be a little  
[14:48] bit late to the party do do you do you do that or 
are you relying on uh YouTube and SATs uh right  
[14:56] now are you still have a fear chop next to it no I 
actually I left my Fiat job in 2021 oh wow that's  
[15:03] s horrible timing I mean I I thought it was a good 
timing that's when uh Bitcoin was 64,000 I think  
[15:10] I thought I was on top of the world and it's been 
a sharp decline since then in terms of my income  
[15:16] but at the same time I've been building stuff 
so I'll just go back a little bit because while  
[15:20] I was still working on my job I was a CPA like a 
chartered professional accountant here so I went I  
[15:25] went through school system the College University 
the it's like a Masters in accounting pretty much  
[15:31] I worked that job for 10 years and kind of while 
I was at the end of my career there right actually  
[15:36] right before the pandemic my little brother and I 
started building a a golf company so we we started  
[15:41] making uh apparel our our main product is custom 
leather head covers so I was kind of doing this in  
[15:47] the mornings at a night uh before and after work 
so I had that to kind of fall back on in terms of  
[15:52] we had some income coming in we had products we 
had a website we had everything built out so it  
[15:57] wasn't a Fiat job but I still had some fat coming 
in at the time but it has been hard like the you  
[16:03] know my I was thinking about it last night as I 
was watching the price go up like that I was like  
[16:07] it it's been it's been tough you know because like 
when I when I left my job I was kind of on top of  
[16:13] the world in terms of I had a lot of uh cryptos I 
had a lot of Bitcoin I had a rental house that I  
[16:18] sold for Bitcoin and everything was up so I was 
like you know what I could I could lost a few  
[16:23] years probably if I needed to um I didn't have 
to sell a whole lot thankfully but it was there  
[16:29] it was kind of my insurance policy where you know 
if I couldn't pay my mortgage that month I would  
[16:33] have to sell a little bit of Bitcoin so it it 
makes you hungry it makes you work and I think  
[16:38] I've done a pretty good job in the last couple 
years to kind of build that Foundation where now  
[16:42] that the price is back up the net worth is up you 
know the the YouTube channel is doing pretty well  
[16:48] um it's it's good it was worth the sacrifice and 
I think you kind of have to go through that the  
[16:53] sacrifice and the hard times to really appreciate 
you know what's happening right now in terms of  
[16:59] the Bitcoin ecosystem absolutely to answer your 
question I don't totally rely on it but it's been  
[17:05] a big part of you know keeping me going more 
than anything else yeah that that's that's a  
[17:12] I mean it's a it's a tough one but it's a great 
story I think and uh it's it sometimes it it feels  
[17:21] like for me it's like that that that they has to 
come something because I just quit my job uh and  
[17:26] since then like Bitcoin just went up all the time 
uh since like the last eight nine months I kind  
[17:32] of timed a good good timing there started podcast 
yeah I think the the the price when I started my  
[17:40] podcast was like I don't know 50 40 what was the 
price I don't know I don't even know so it was  
[17:46] way lower than I started at TW almost a year ago 
so 28th of November I don't know what the price  
[17:54] was back then I I I I actually started paying 
attention to the price just a last couple of weeks  
[17:59] because it's so much on the Twitter feed before 
I did not uh pay attention at all but yeah it's  
[18:05] it's also brings a topic up that I think a lot of 
people in Bitcoin are uh looking at and a lot of  
[18:12] people really search for that type of content 
and I'm always a little bit hesitating with uh  
[18:18] giving advice on that one but I think there are 
some interesting things around that with retiring  
[18:24] on bitcoin because as you um uh basically yourself 
uh you can time this uh the top and then it's like  
[18:34] your retirement plans if if all of the sudden it 
crashes down to a certain level uh it changes your  
[18:40] retirement plans so retiring on bitcoin because 
it's still so fluctuating in the purchasing  
[18:46] power uh it's it's a hard topic but at the same 
time I always encourage people to to go go about  
[18:53] your passion and and find something so if if your 
plan is just just like I I retire on bitcoin and  
[18:59] don't want to do anything you better have a lot of 
Bitcoin yeah uh but if your plan is like oh I just  
[19:06] want to retire on bitcoin but in my retirement I 
really want to work hard on my passion that's a  
[19:12] b that's a better plan it's basically starting a 
business so I I guess uh on that what what advice  
[19:17] do you have on retiring on bitcoin as you made it 
yourself well I kind of talked about this on my  
[19:23] show this morning actually and I was thinking 
about this uh in the last little week or last  
[19:27] week I thought you know there's there's kind of 
three types of people right now in the current  
[19:32] state of where we are the first one the majority 
of people where they're going a a N9 to-5 job  
[19:38] they're earning Fiat they're spending Fiat they're 
saving in Fiat they're living in that world still  
[19:44] and that that's a majority of people the the 
second group would be the the people who are  
[19:49] going a 9 to-5 job getting paid in Fiat but 
converting that every time they get paid or  
[19:55] a portion of it into Bitcoin so they're saving in 
Bitcoin they're earning Fiat so that's the second  
[20:00] group the third group is the people who are doing 
their own thing doing their starting a business uh  
[20:07] following whatever they are excited about they're 
earning Bitcoin they're earning some Fiat they're  
[20:11] converting into Bitcoin but they're focusing their 
time on freedom more so than anything and I think  
[20:17] that that's what Bitcoin provides I think instead 
of like a monetary unit or a Fiat price it's  
[20:22] it's freedom because it's buying you time so I I 
think that too many people are still in the 9 to5  
[20:29] they're just they think that they're going to be 
able to you know hit x amount of Bitcoin like get  
[20:33] to one Bitcoin then they can retire but I don't 
think that that's the case and I don't think  
[20:38] that's what people should be striving for and so 
going back to like the three categories of people  
[20:42] the the third type of person there the person who 
started their own business focused on bitcoin and  
[20:48] is earning SATs flow every month whatever they're 
doing they they're converting Fiat into SATs or  
[20:53] they're you know they have a zap. stream or a 
Noster they're earning SATs but I think that  
[20:58] more people people should be focusing on that 
because you know even if you got to one Bitcoin  
[21:04] and even if the price is a million dollars and 
but you still have to go to work every day and  
[21:08] do a nine-to-five job for somebody else that you 
don't necessarily love doing I don't I wouldn't  
[21:13] consider that a success personally even though you 
have a bunch of Bitcoin in the on the cold card or  
[21:19] the bitbox or whatever you have I don't think that 
that's a success I think that people more people  
[21:25] should be focused on the freedom aspect of it so 
you're still adding value you're still doing what  
[21:29] you want to do you're helping people but it's on 
your own schedule right and so even though these  
[21:36] last couple years for me have been incredibly 
tough financially I I knew what was coming here  
[21:42] I mean I thought I did anyways it turned out to be 
right but I knew that the hard work and like the  
[21:46] sacri because if you're earning Fiat converting 
into Bitcoin you're going to end up with more  
[21:49] Bitcoin than somebody who's just kind of starting 
their own thing you know scraping away but I think  
[21:56] that the things I've done in the last couple years 
in terms of setting it up where I can do you know  
[22:00] I'm flexible with my time I'm doing stuff I enjoy 
I'm earning a STS flow every month I think that  
[22:05] over the long run that's going to be a much better 
path even though shortterm it hurt long term I  
[22:10] think that's a place so people are out there who 
you know if you have a 9-5 job just thinking about  
[22:16] just start thinking about things that you enjoy 
doing because the good news about everything we've  
[22:20] talked about so far is that you're going to be 
able to do that right I I foresee a future where  
[22:26] there the whole corporate structure changes in 
terms of you're not going to be there's not going  
[22:30] to be bosses they not going to be managers there's 
not going to be a whole bunch of faat in every  
[22:33] corporation most people are going to be working 
for themselves and and probably earning Bitcoin  
[22:38] so if you if you can take a short-term hit and you 
know even if you have even if you have to put your  
[22:43] Bitcoin stacking on on the side for a little while 
here if you can start building something that you  
[22:48] enjoy doing there's so many tools for that now um 
and I think that that's the future so if you can  
[22:54] start getting ahead of that when the time comes uh 
I think you're going to be in a much better place  
[23:01] I 100% agree and just for the people listening um 
I would have had more Bitcoin right now if I would  
[23:10] have stayed in my Fe job the last eight months um 
but what I wouldn't have is the freedom to go last  
[23:18] week to El Salvador uh and just spend the week 
there uh and it didn't I did not needed holidays  
[23:25] for that because I just worked there a little bit 
uh and yeah now because I'm podcasting business  
[23:30] kind of like a Bitcoin conference is my work but 
it just doesn't feel like that I will be Abu Dhabi  
[23:37] in two weeks um it's just um once you have your 
own schedule you cannot even imagine going back  
[23:45] so like for me it it's not even in my mind I 
I last time a friend of mine uh asked me that  
[23:52] he's like how much money would have would your old 
company have to give you to consider joining and  
[24:00] I was like I don't know if the amount they would 
have to pay actually makes sense for them to pay  
[24:08] but I don't know if there's even such a thing 
because I don't want to put a price take on my  
[24:15] freedom if I don't have to if I'm in that position 
of not having to give up my freedom why would I so  
[24:22] why why would I do it for money yes okay I have 
more money but where is my time gone and then  
[24:29] only the only thing that is more valuable than 
Bitcoin is your own freaking time because you  
[24:34] will die at some point I mean there are some uh 
people that say we will not die and we will live  
[24:39] longer and but I don't want to get into that 
but uh I think most likely we're all going to  
[24:45] die at some point and I think it's it's part of 
life uh but it will uh it changes your life and  
[24:52] your perspective uh in in just very short 
amount of time being self reliant also um  
[24:58] being self-reliant changes your relationship 
to money I already look differently at money  
[25:04] than most people because of Bitcoin but now with 
being self-employed uh I look so different on on  
[25:11] on money because I just don't want to spend any 
money that doesn't uh make that I don't need to  
[25:18] spend or that I love to spend or that I need 
for the business so so it completely changes  
[25:25] the things but but you said um you kind of see 
this 9 to5 dying I hear that a lot do do you  
[25:32] think that the freelancing one two three four 
person companies uh and and smaller units and  
[25:39] smaller startups with like maximum of like 20 30 
people maybe is is is the is the future to go at  
[25:44] 9 to5 will almost completely be gone yeah mostly 
because we have the ability now and you know as  
[25:52] as bad as the pandemic was for a lot of people uh 
in a lot of ways but it it really much or it very  
[26:00] much introduced the the fact that we can work from 
anywhere now you don't have to be in the office  
[26:05] and you know I still think that there is something 
there in terms of being around people being around  
[26:12] that energy in terms of generating ideas if that's 
what your business is if you need that it is very  
[26:17] important to be face Toof face with people but I 
think that you know just think about the people  
[26:24] who are spending hours every single day driving 
to commuting to their work and I know that some  
[26:30] people still are but like I think that that's 
fading away I you we just talked about this  
[26:35] scarcity of time and how important that is you're 
spending two two and a half three hours every day  
[26:40] D in traffic driving to a job that you don't love 
just so you can feed yourself like that's kind of  
[26:45] what the system has created that's what it turned 
us into but the technology now allows for anybody  
[26:51] to work from anywhere and Bitcoin is going to be 
the the payment rails that connects everybody and  
[26:55] unlocks that economy that we could not have before 
so if I wanted to go all you have to do is just  
[27:02] think back like 10 years ago where the place that 
I live in now we grew up here like my parents had  
[27:07] a cabin here and even up until five years ago we 
didn't have internet here like we would come out  
[27:13] here for the summer we had a satellite dish to 
watch TV eventually but we never had internet  
[27:18] there was no Wi-Fi there was there was none of 
that this wasn't an option five years ago and so  
[27:23] I think the whole landscape in terms of people 
wanting to you know working where they want to  
[27:28] uh being more with their kids or their family 
or their dog or whatever it it just makes too  
[27:34] much sense now and so you know if you're boss 
says no to that if you say you know I can work  
[27:39] from home a couple days a week if they say no 
corporate policies everybody's got to be in the  
[27:42] office you say okay well you know I have these 
skills that I've accured through the years I  
[27:47] know that now with with the internet and with 
the unlocked economy that we have I can just  
[27:52] contract my workout to whoever I want to I can 
get on to Noster I can get on to a whole bunch  
[27:57] of different different platforms and just say like 
you can kind of design your own life now that was  
[28:02] never an option five years ago and and it's kind 
of the the media plus uh having Bitcoin uh kind  
[28:10] of unlocks the vision of the sovereign individual 
that's I this the first time I realized that was  
[28:18] a PTC uh I don't know if you know the the company 
air PTC it's basically Airbnb but Bitcoin only uh  
[28:25] the same concept uh really nice and I interviewed 
the CEO of them and they operate truly Bitcoin  
[28:32] only so they only get paid in Bitcoin and they 
only pay every supplier vendor and and people  
[28:39] involved in Bitcoin with that they don't need 
a home they don't need a home for that business  
[28:45] because it's just a website and Bitcoin and that 
changes everything everything right and you know  
[28:53] I think people will eventually get there it'll 
take a while for all businesses to all Bitcoin  
[28:59] and like I just don't know if that's a reality for 
you know our lifetime or not but at the same time  
[29:04] like the people who are doing that the people who 
have taken the time and put in the work to learn  
[29:08] how to do that and the key there is that they're 
obviously doing high enough quality work that  
[29:14] they can say that to their customers because if 
they were just like another company with another  
[29:18] product their their customers would say okay well 
we're not going to get on this Bitcoin thing we'll  
[29:23] just find somebody else we can pay Fiat to like 
that's way too complex but obviously they're doing  
[29:28] good enough work where they're in such demand that 
they have the ability to do that and I think that  
[29:33] that's something that every bitcoiner should be 
striving for and we're talking about your podcast  
[29:37] and the stuff I'm doing but you know you don't 
have to you don't have to Pigeon haul yourself  
[29:41] into thinking about just Bitcoin businesses 
like whatever it is that you do if you're a  
[29:46] nine-to-five employee you have a lot of value and 
you've put in a lot of work in terms of recuring  
[29:51] those skills so just put those to work just except 
for working some instead of working for somebody  
[29:56] else with their schedule with their rules you just 
apply those same skills and uh and value that you  
[30:02] have but you have the whole world to offer to 
now and so that that's kind of the idea there it  
[30:07] doesn't have to be in Bitcoin it doesn't have to 
be a podcast it just just start start change your  
[30:14] thinking in terms of in two years from now I'm 
going to be My Own Boss whether I'm replaced by AI  
[30:19] or some or I just leave but in two years from now 
I'm going to be my own boss so at in the mornings  
[30:25] at night whenever you have free chance just start 
thinking about what what your business would look  
[30:30] like who your customers would be you know what 
what you need to to roll that out because it's  
[30:35] coming I partnered up with coin vigilante this is 
the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever  
[30:43] saw created by anyone look at that beauty I love 
it so much coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin  
[30:51] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent way to 
go out there and show that you are a Bitcoin  
[30:58] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin 
vigilante just dropped a completely new and  
[31:05] amazing Genesis edition of their watch collections 
you have the date of the first ever mined Bitcoin  
[31:13] Block in there and of course also the block height 
and which EPO we are currently in I love the level  
[31:20] of detail they put in in this masterpiece and make 
sure to check out those amazing coin vigilante  
[31:27] time pieces down in the descriptions I love those 
watches so so much if you watch or listen to my  
[31:35] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess you already 
bought some Bitcoin and now the most important  
[31:41] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in 
a hardware wallet my personal recommendation for  
[31:47] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super secure 
it's simple to set up it's also perfect gift for  
[31:53] a friend who has still the Bitcoin on an exchange 
and you can get a 5% discount with the code Robin  
[32:00] at the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to 
get your bitbox and the next step is to really  
[32:08] level up your sovereignty as an individual you 
have to have the most secure self custody setup  
[32:15] you have to secure your own devices you have 
to protect your privacy you have to set up an  
[32:21] inheritance plan and depending on where you live 
you even want to have a plan b a citizensh where  
[32:28] you can move in case something goes really really 
wrong and through all those steps the Bitcoin way  
[32:33] is guiding you through step by step and if you 
visit the Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin  
[32:41] you even get a 30 minute free call to find out 
how you can level up your sovereignty and uh it  
[32:48] ties perfectly into that I think I think 40% was 
the number um like there's this zombie companies  
[32:58] topic where like a lot of companies are just 
existing because they can benefit from the  
[33:03] feeld system and because they are big uh and a 
lot of those companies just wouldn't exist on a  
[33:10] hard money uh proof of work standard like Bitcoin 
uh and uh this this will change a lot I I see it  
[33:18] even outside of the Bitcoin Community to be honest 
with friends that just like quit the job and try  
[33:23] their own thing or even as you just said they took 
a software develop he worked for a big company  
[33:29] and he was really unsatisfied with how things 
were going there and especially with software  
[33:34] development it's so easy these days uh and he just 
went ahead and is now a freelancer and he gets he  
[33:42] just after what was it like four months he earned 
50% more and had instead of one income three  
[33:49] incomes and worked the same hours and he could be 
wherever he wants to be and he just took what you  
[33:57] just said into action of like quitting that 9 
to5 putting on a little bit more risk a little  
[34:04] bit more self- responsibility and diversified 
his income stream and was his own boss and this  
[34:10] has nothing to do with Bitcoin even Bitcoin makes 
things easier and gives you maybe a cussion and  
[34:16] and makes also the the global transition better 
but that's possible for everyone yeah absolutely  
[34:21] and I I think that that's something that we 
need to really you know switch our mindset  
[34:25] around is like you want to whether whether you're 
talking about I don't know Bitcoin storage whether  
[34:31] you're talking about important data whether you're 
talking about your income stream you all you never  
[34:37] want to have one single point of failure right 
so with Bitcoin storage that's a past phrase or  
[34:44] that's a decoy wallet or that's a multi signature 
setup with your data that means you have a backup  
[34:49] hard drive and you back that up uh a couple times 
I've been on the other side of that where it's not  
[34:54] very pretty but that's a single point of failure 
if you you have everything on your phone or your  
[34:59] computer or on one hard drive that's a single 
point of failure and one of my favorite uh quotes  
[35:04] that I've kind of you know tried to implement 
into my own life is that two is one and one is  
[35:09] none which means if you have one of anything it's 
zero because it could be taken away instantly you  
[35:14] could lose it something could happen to it that's 
zero if you have two that's one if you have one  
[35:19] that's none so and you apply that to your income 
streams too right if you got one income stream  
[35:24] all of a sudden that disappears you're on the 
streets or you're you know you're in bankruptcy  
[35:29] whereas if you have a couple different streams of 
income whether that's dividend income in the old  
[35:33] system whether that's um you know I like to think 
about it and I forget who even who taught me this  
[35:39] concept but think about it like a a wheel right 
and every spoke within that wheel is a different  
[35:46] stream of income and you want to get as many 
spokes on that wheel as possible as whatever  
[35:51] amount they are you know a big spoke could be like 
your main income but then you have in a bitcoiners  
[35:58] life that could be maybe you do a live stream once 
a week on zap stream that's another flow of of of  
[36:03] that's another spoke on there or you just listen 
to a podcast every day on Fountain and that's  
[36:08] another income stream there as big or little as 
they are the more of those spokes on that wheel  
[36:12] you have the less Reliant you are on other ones 
and that really accumulates over time the more you  
[36:18] can add to that regardless of what the amount is 
especially when you're talking Bitcoin that adds  
[36:23] up and that's kind of what you want to design your 
life around is that wheel of income where you have  
[36:27] whole bunch of different sources of income coming 
in and you're not as Reliant that that eliminates  
[36:32] your single point of failure it's it it's so true 
is that maybe kind of the the next Bitcoin chapter  
[36:41] of like what what's happening I think a lot about 
what's the next Bitcoin store over the next like  
[36:47] five to 10 years we had in in the beginning it 
was just like a small nerdy stuff that only a  
[36:54] very very handful of people um knew about then 
it kind of got a little bit more popular uh at  
[37:01] some point they got publicly traded companies now 
countries now the the big narrative around that is  
[37:07] like nation state former strategic reserve and all 
that things uh what what is what is for you kind  
[37:13] of the the next big chapter of of of Bitcoin if 
this like an an headline written over is like the  
[37:19] next five to 10 years what do you think is like 
the the next narrative so I think that within the  
[37:25] next five or 10 years and this might be jumping 
the gun a little bit here here but you know just  
[37:29] say 5 10 15 somewhere in the in the not so distant 
future uh I believe that we're not even going to  
[37:35] know what the price of Bitcoin is and the reason I 
say that I think that there's there's three things  
[37:42] that have to happen in order for us to get there 
uh the first one in my eyes was Wall Street when  
[37:49] the when the biggest money in the world can flow 
into Bitcoin and have access to that this asset  
[37:54] that's a big deal and that that's when everything 
changed in January 2020 24 so that one's done the  
[37:59] second one and I'm going off my memory here but 
the second one is uh strategic reserve for the  
[38:07] US the US is the most influential country in the 
world and when when I think when Trump there's a  
[38:14] lot of people this hasn't been priced in at all 
yet because I think most people really believe  
[38:18] that he's bluffing on it and it's not going to 
happen I think the poly Market on is like 56%  
[38:23] yes which is still a good sign but it's definitely 
not priced in yet I I would put it more towards  
[38:29] you know this is just my opinion but I would say 
it's more towards 95% it they just can't go back  
[38:36] on it now because it's going through the house or 
the the Senate through the lamus bill and that's  
[38:42] going to take you know six months or whatever but 
Trump's a businessman he's a as much as people  
[38:47] discredit him as intelligence he's a businessman 
he knows how this stuff works it doesn't really  
[38:51] make sense to announce that they're going to do 
it and then let everybody else front run them so  
[38:56] I think it's the more accurate thing is going to 
be early 2025 Trump's going to do an executive  
[39:01] order and write it into law that they're going to 
start their strategic reserve and that's going to  
[39:07] as you mentioned create such fomo around the 
world for nation states every country is going  
[39:12] to have to compete with that so they're going to 
start uh corporations we've seen like five or six  
[39:16] corporations this week who have announced that 
they're adding Bitcoin to their Treasury and then  
[39:21] obviously that's going to flow down to the retail 
market so that's number two number two is the US  
[39:28] probably the US um implements a strategic reserve 
and then the third one is that when it hits a  
[39:34] million dollar when when Bitcoin gets to a million 
dollars that's when one sat equals one cent and I  
[39:43] think even at 90 wherever we are right now there 
people still see Bitcoin as like something that's  
[39:49] so far out of reach that they just don't even pay 
any attention to it they they see the N $90,000  
[39:55] they're like well I don't even have $90 in my 
bank account so I'm not going to pay any sort of  
[40:00] attention to that but when One S equals one cent 
or when Bitcoin hits $1 million then you know it's  
[40:07] going to go from one cent to two cents to five 
cents like a penny stock would right and that's  
[40:12] when everybody's coming in that's when everybody's 
you know paying attention now because they can get  
[40:17] these they won't even that's why I said I don't 
think they'll know what a Bitcoin even cost  
[40:21] anymore we'll know when it's going from 1 cent 
to 2 cent to 5 Cent that's jumping up hundreds of  
[40:26] thousands of dollars in bitcoin price but in SATs 
it's only one cent at a time so those three things  
[40:33] I think are really going to and whenever it plays 
out I think it's going to happen pretty fast much  
[40:38] faster than people think I shared an analogy here 
and if you got uh if you got 30 seconds for me to  
[40:44] read it here I'll uh I'll of course I'll explain 
kind of the logic on that and the I bitcoiners  
[40:51] have heard the term gradually than suddenly before 
I think Paca leis was the one that that kind of  
[40:57] popularized that right yes so this is a this is 
analogy I saw on Noster actually the other day  
[41:05] so the analogy was it's based on exponential 
growth like gradually and suddenly how this  
[41:10] whole thing plays out so the the analogy and I'm 
going to be reading this so uh imagine a football  
[41:16] stadium being filled with water every minute one 
drop is added the number of drops doubles every  
[41:23] minute so it goes from one drop to two drops to 
four to 8 16 32 64 Etc how long do you think it  
[41:30] would take to fill the entire Stadium a day a week 
a year I'll let you every minute or every second  
[41:39] is a drop at it or every minute and it doubles 
so it goes from oneop two drops to four to eight  
[41:45] oh man I think that's that's that's pretty 
fast but I I can only guess here because uh  
[41:52] my brain cannot comprehend exponential growth 
I was uh I did that example with like second  
[41:57] and how many minutes and stays it um I would say 
I would say uh a day maybe yeah I think that's a  
[42:07] pretty fair pretty fair guess it's it's 50 minutes 
5- Z 50 one hour but the crazy part about it is  
[42:17] how how full do you think it would be after 45 
minutes so it completely fills up after 50 but  
[42:23] how how much do you what percentage do you think 
it is after 45 minutes oh man uh let's say 70%  
[42:33] that's what most it said most could guess 70 to 
90% but after 45 minutes the stadium is only 7%  
[42:40] full wait seven I I thought maybe 50% but then I 
thought like 50% is lower 7% wow so in the in the  
[42:49] final five minutes the stadium goes from 7% full 
to 100% full so in the last five minutes there  
[42:57] that's when 93% of the stadium fills up in the 
final five minutes and I think that we're going  
[43:03] to go through the exact same kind of thing in 
Bitcoin that's crazy I just want to Briefly  
[43:09] summarize that you have a football stadium every 
minute you add a drop and uh every minute you  
[43:16] don't add one drop like it it it doubles like the 
first minute is one drop the second minute is two  
[43:21] drops and so forth uh and after 45 minutes you 
have seven % and if you just stop there and ask  
[43:29] people oh when will it be finished most people is 
okay 7% after 45 minutes maybe right yeah and then  
[43:37] we're like oh yeah maybe like half a day or a day 
or maybe two days whatever uh but then it's full  
[43:44] after 50 minutes just like a few more minutes 
and and it goes from seven uh% to full 100% uh  
[43:52] it kind of opens your eyes to what Bitcoin can 
actually do I also have that theory that when  
[43:58] we at a million dollars in Bitcoin I think this 
is the moment where the general population will  
[44:06] actually wake up I think before that maybe 10% are 
aware actually aware of Bitcoin now it's like I  
[44:13] don't know maybe 1% of the population is a little 
bit aware of of it like there are a lot of people  
[44:19] like hundreds of millions of people in Bitcoin 
when you count everything in there with the ETFs  
[44:23] and everything but how many people actually have a 
significant amount in Bitcoin like how many people  
[44:29] are there in the world that have over 50% of their 
net worth in Bitcoin 200,000 300,000 I don't know  
[44:36] maybe a million uh no clue about that number but 
I think it's it's a very low number uh and I think  
[44:42] at a million we still like very low but then you 
say with the sense and with the public perception  
[44:48] and we we switch slowly from looking at Bitcoin 
to looking at SATs this could this this this  
[44:55] could actually be this like uh suddenly moment so 
you think like the million dollar Bitcoin is kind  
[45:01] of this suddenly moment or is it occurring before 
the the the million dollar price I think the the  
[45:07] million the okay what what's this analogy so I 
think the million dollars is at the 45 minute  
[45:13] Mark where if you think of a drop just like a 
bitcoiner coming into the coming into Bitcoin  
[45:19] adopting Bitcoin up until the 7% but once it hits 
that that's when it starts going from 7 to to 100  
[45:27] and that's when we don't know what the price 
of Bitcoin is because if you think about what  
[45:31] it looks like at that time where one sat equals 
1 cent and then two cents and then people are  
[45:37] like okay well I can actually afford to get like 
before this gets to you know one set equals $1  
[45:43] I can get a lot of these now like it it's just 
human psychology it's how people see things so  
[45:49] then it goes from one cent to 50 cents just like a 
penny stock would to a dollar and then it's so at  
[45:56] a dollar for one sat that's a $100 million Bitcoin 
and then all of a sudden it's a120 and then $5 and  
[46:02] then that's $500 million Bitcoin right and that's 
how you get to like these large numbers you hear  
[46:07] people talk about this and you're like well 
how could it ever go from 990,000 to or 50,000  
[46:13] even 50,000 to a billion dollars there's no that 
doesn't even make sense but if you understand how  
[46:19] exponential growth works and how human psychology 
ties into this and you combine that with an asset  
[46:25] like it's it's similar to a penny stock in terms 
of the human psychology aspect of it but it's so  
[46:30] much different because we've never had an asset 
with a a scarce asset with a fixed Supply like  
[46:35] Bitcoin is that's Global that can be sent anywhere 
that has zero friction there's never been anything  
[46:41] like this before that's that's so true and I think 
that's what a lot of people try to do they they  
[46:47] they try to model Bitcoin around something that is 
already existing in the past but you cannot model  
[46:55] Bitcoin to anything it just never we never had 
true scarcity and we definitely never had true  
[47:03] scarcity in the digital age uh so you just have 
no clue what's going on and there's all those  
[47:09] money flooding in and you just have like this 
fixed layer that is just not giving up and the  
[47:16] supply just stays the same no matter what happens 
yeah it's uh nobody is Polish enough on bitcoin no  
[47:24] and nobody is and you know when when you see have 
vision of the future and you actually it's it's  
[47:29] so much different than our our brains are used 
to thinking like but when when you see the world  
[47:35] when you see the vision for that and that's why 
you know these last couple years I talked about  
[47:40] they've been tough obviously financially when uh 
you know you leave your job and you start doing  
[47:44] your own thing it's it's a risk it's a big jump 
and especially as you know when you leave and the  
[47:49] price goes down and your net worth goes down with 
it meanwhile you're not bringing a whole lot in  
[47:53] but when you see that future when you see the 
vision you understand what's coming here then  
[47:58] you know it makes my the time I spend working in 
this stuff it makes sense to me it wouldn't make  
[48:04] sense to a whole lot of people who don't see that 
same vision of the future but like I I do a live  
[48:09] show every morning on YouTube and zap stream and 
you know usually there's let's say 10,000 SATs of  
[48:15] people zap in every show so it doesn't seem like 
much because that's like 10 bucks so I'm like okay  
[48:21] well I just work for two hours I got $10 worth of 
tips doesn't really make sense but then if you see  
[48:26] like if if I'm going to be holding that for a long 
time the Bitcoin is the perfect battery you can it  
[48:31] stores your energy and is unless there's no leaks 
that's what sailor talks about all the time unlike  
[48:37] Fiat unlike this other system we have there's no 
leaks there so you put that energy into a battery  
[48:42] let's say take those 10,000 SATs fast forward 
10 years where one sat equals $1 okay well that  
[48:48] makes a lot more sense I'm getting paid $10,000 
per hour and so if you're actually living in the  
[48:53] future in that sense and I kind of you know this 
whole I I give a lot of credit to Jeff Booth for  
[48:58] this because he changed my whole perception of of 
the future and and thinking in a Bitcoin standard  
[49:04] instead of the Fiat world are we're programmed 
we're a fish Born Into Water in the Fiat system  
[49:09] and it's really hard to break out of that even 
if you've been in a mered in Bitcoin for a long  
[49:14] time but if you're living in the future then you 
understand how valuable those STS are there's no  
[49:20] leaks in those sets that that's a very true point 
and then it's I think people still don't it's  
[49:26] it's such a if you say it it sounds so easy it's 
like yeah okay there's no leak and it cannot go  
[49:32] anywhere and it's like fixed Supply but but I 
think on a brain level people have a hard time  
[49:38] rubbing the hand around and what this actually 
means and when sailor says like oh like why would  
[49:43] you diversify from this perfect steel ship and 
go to uh do I don't know 20% of your assets to  
[49:50] this wooden ship like why would you go there 
if you know it has such a high risk of going  
[49:55] down um and why wouldn't you put everything in in 
the Good Ship um one one thing that I'm wondering  
[50:02] how important do you think is price to to the 
whole story I think we with Bitcoin are kind of  
[50:09] try to like ah one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin the 
price doesn't matter but then all the new Bas  
[50:14] come because of the price and it's kind of 
the the perfect marketing tool for Bitcoin  
[50:19] how important is is is the price and talking 
about the price also for for you yes I mean  
[50:25] Satoshi designed Bitcoin like that's why I don't 
think that Bitcoin was one person I think it was  
[50:30] a very very wellth thought out group of people 
with um Crystal Clear Vision of the future and  
[50:36] they did not leave there was no leaks in the plan 
of of Satoshi and so even the fact of the markets  
[50:42] and human psychology and how that all ties into 
it like as you said every four years with the  
[50:46] bull cycle or at least up until this point there 
every four years there's a whole new influx of  
[50:52] of bitcoiners coming in and we haven't really seen 
that even this this bull run yet but a lot of them  
[50:58] will buy Bitcoin they'll they'll hold it they'll 
just you know see it as a speculative asset they  
[51:02] want to be part of this they see the number going 
up and I would say that 80% of those people will  
[51:08] probably fall off they'll either you know sell 
early they'll they'll over leverage themselves  
[51:13] they'll have to sell it at a at a lower price 
that'll turn them off Bitcoin for a while but  
[51:19] there's usually 10 or 20% of bitcoiners who 
get through that cycle and those are the ones  
[51:25] who are doing podcast now and they're the ones 
who are telling their friends about it and and  
[51:30] educating anybody who wants to listen to them 
about it and that's that's the whole foundation  
[51:35] and that's what the Cycles create that's what the 
Fiat price creates is the the demand the um the  
[51:41] hardened bitcoiners that stick around and continue 
to grow this thing it's a Grassroots thing that's  
[51:46] the that's it's crazy to think about that there's 
no marketing team there's no CEO there's nobody  
[51:53] here this is just people basically Ming this 
thing into existence right because like for 16  
[52:02] years we've had such a Negative marketing against 
Bitcoin and you can point to the environment the  
[52:10] drug drug dealers the trafficking all that kind 
of stuff all they've been able to do for the last  
[52:14] 16 years is just throw stuff at it and some of 
it sticks for a little while but it eventually  
[52:19] just falls off and against all that we managed to 
to grow it to a trillion dollar asset soon soon  
[52:26] to be $2 trillion asset with absolutely no signs 
of slowing down and so it's important to the the  
[52:33] Fiat price it's it's just that's how humans are 
right they they everything right now is priced in  
[52:38] US Dollars all assets on Earth are pretty much 
priced in US dollars but the problem with that  
[52:44] the problem with pricing things and this is why 
Society in my opinion is so broken right now is  
[52:49] because we're we're measuring everything in the 
world whether that's our time our houses our land  
[52:55] Gold Everything thing is is being compared 
to a currency that's illusionary in a sense  
[53:02] because we don't know how many US dollars are out 
there they tell us that there's this figure here  
[53:08] approximately but they've never been audited 
before the Federal Reserve the banks of each  
[53:14] country they never get audited so we're trusting 
the fact that these figures are accurate but we  
[53:19] have no idea there could be double there could 
be 10x that we have no idea and so when you're  
[53:24] measuring the every asset on Earth against the 
currency that's broken nothing makes sense and we  
[53:32] don't know how many there are today we don't know 
how many there's going to be in 10 years from now  
[53:36] because governments changed and people change 
that and that's what happens when you give a  
[53:39] small group of people the ability to create money 
but with Bitcoin you replace Bitcoin with the US  
[53:44] dollar as the that's why it reprices everything 
that's the denominator where it's fixed we know  
[53:50] how much there is today you can go on the website 
right now to see how many Bitcoin are out there  
[53:54] there's a supply schedule that's known so in 
10 years from now we know how many Bitcoin are  
[53:59] going to exist and so you can plan better you can 
prepare you can do everything much more accurately  
[54:04] when you have a a hard denominator which we've 
never had before in our lifetime or in the last  
[54:10] hundred years at least you mentioned something 
very interesting and important I think uh we Meed  
[54:16] this thing into existence and I truly think that 
the new warfare is kind of information Warfare  
[54:25] and the new soldiers are like uh meme graders 
uh content graders uh moderators podcast hosts  
[54:33] whatever uh you you you you can't do that but 
we we are in that information Warfare where we  
[54:40] fight for what's right and what's wrong uh what 
What's the actual misinformation and what's the  
[54:46] not actual misinformation um and I think that's 
kind of like an really interesting um way to to to  
[54:56] look at that with with we can now Meme and uh 
digital money into the the hands of black Croc  
[55:04] like how amazing is that well I mean it's just the 
form of communication that everybody Speaks now  
[55:10] it's like a whole new language right and in order 
for things to work in order to you know that's we  
[55:16] just talked about the price of Fiat in terms of 
getting interest in things like people have to  
[55:20] see the value in this they they're they see the 
number going up so they want to be part of that  
[55:24] but in order to you know if you have a Bitcoin 
today and you want to hold on to that Bitcoin  
[55:29] for the next 20 50 years and pass it on to your 
generations of of uh family like it it requires  
[55:36] you to actually care it requires that interest to 
learn and to have the conviction because there's  
[55:41] going to be you know I I'll s I'll put this one 
on hold for a second but there's going to you're  
[55:46] going to be very tempted to sell and you're going 
to be it's going to crash and you're going to be  
[55:50] tempted to sell that way and so you have to have 
the knowledge you have to have the conviction to  
[55:56] we're we're very lucky to be here right now but 
not everybody's going to get through this the  
[55:59] people who don't have the conviction over Bitcoin 
right now are going to get rid of their Bitcoin  
[56:03] it's going to go into the Black Rock vacuum so 
those memes are just kind of like the the language  
[56:08] of like okay maybe this is kind of interesting 
maybe you know instead of reading a a 20page  
[56:13] document of why Bitcoin works you know compare 
the the Federal Reserve never been audited in  
[56:19] 90 years it's a meme and people can understand 
that much more effectively than having to show  
[56:25] them 20 Page document on what Bitcoin is and 
why we think it'll be successful so just going  
[56:31] back to why I think people will be tempted to 
sell here is because with with the scarce fixed  
[56:37] asset like Bitcoin Black Rock their only move 
here they're obviously going to try to get as  
[56:42] much Bitcoin as they can they've been doing it 
for 11 months now and they're they're showing no  
[56:46] signs of stopping and they're GNA there's going to 
come a point where they run out of Bitcoin to buy  
[56:51] and so what they're going to do the only reason 
they're going to get Bitcoin from me or from you  
[56:56] is to try to tempt us to sell so they're going 
to be more than happy to run up the price their  
[57:00] clients are going to be happy their management 
fee on their portfolios their funds are going to  
[57:04] go up and that's going to be the only way that 
they're going to be able to get our Bitcoin is  
[57:08] by running the price up so people are going to be 
tempted to sell people are going to get in at 80k  
[57:12] 90k 100K it's going to go up to 200 300 400 and 
all those people are going to sell and it's just  
[57:17] going to go right into the Black Rock vacuum and 
that's what they want because you have to consider  
[57:22] here that they have pretty much they don't have a 
money printer but they pretty much have unlimited  
[57:26] Capital so they don't care what the price is but 
they know how much Bitcoin there's left and that's  
[57:33] that's their main thing right now is they want to 
get as much of that Bitcoin as they can and they  
[57:37] don't care what the price is I'm kind of amazed 
how good uh Black Rock understands Bitcoin and and  
[57:44] what how good they also portray that in their 
presentations like they they actually did the  
[57:49] research deeply they actually understand what the 
Bitcoin Community is and I I think they they have  
[57:56] done years worth of researching behind the scenes 
before they even started to applying so they are  
[58:02] not they're not [ __ ] around they're they're 
really coming in and they have a game plan and  
[58:08] they want to acquire all the Bitcoin so that's 
uh it's take example on Black Rock just like  
[58:17] make a game plan don't sell buy as much as you 
can and and make a make a um how should I say  
[58:26] not a game plan but yeah something like a game 
plan strategy yeah exactly you have to be thinking  
[58:32] about that stuff and I think that you know 
that's that's one me one message that I try to  
[58:36] communicate as often as I can on the show is like 
buying buying is the easy part buying Bitcoin is  
[58:42] the easy part as much as people are intimidated 
by it and it's just like it's so easy to do now  
[58:48] but but holding it in and having it in 20 years 
from now and gain the knowledge and conviction to  
[58:53] to actually get through the highs and the lows 
that's the hard part and I think that people  
[58:57] actually have to be thinking through this stuff 
whether it's their Bitcoin security whether that's  
[59:02] their inheritance planning like most bitcoiners 
if if if most bitcoiners got hit by a bus tomorrow  
[59:08] their Bitcoin would be gone nobody would get 
that ever again which is good for Bitcoin good  
[59:12] for bitcoiners but terrible for their family 
like going back to the battery analogy where  
[59:18] I take my time I take my energy I take my value 
and I want to store it in a battery that's going  
[59:24] to be there in 100 years from now and I want to 
pass that on to my family and if you don't if you  
[59:30] failed if you're so focused on buying and price 
watching and leveraging with micro strategy and  
[59:37] you fail to actually put a plan in place where 
if something were to happen to you your family  
[59:41] can get access to that that's just a completely I 
I consider it completely wasted life because you  
[59:47] took everything that you've ever done you put it 
into the best battery ever and because you were  
[59:51] too lazy or too stubborn to set up an inheritance 
plan or have something in place and now nobody has  
[59:58] that because you because the average age is 80 and 
you're 30 years old you thought you had 50 more  
[60:03] years like life happens very fast and and when 
we least expect it to so with Fiat it's whatever  
[60:09] somebody else can get a hold of it somehow with 
Bitcoin you can't do that that's that's so true  
[60:16] I I love that a lot really cool um maybe on that 
note uh besides the inheritance plan what advice  
[60:24] do you have for people especially for the people 
that entered in the bare market and for them it's  
[60:29] like the first ever bull market uh what advice do 
we have for them entering now maybe in a really  
[60:35] crazy big flashy Bull Run flashy yeah it's going 
to be flashy uh two things just going along I'll  
[60:43] start with that with the flashy part there's 
going to be distractions every Bull Run we've  
[60:48] had has had distractions in the past it's been 
altcoins it's been FTX this B run it's going to be  
[60:56] micro strategy maybe some altcoins salana maybe 
and those are just distractions and the the thing  
[61:03] that leads everybody here is Bitcoin that's the 
thing that people should be focused on is Bitcoin  
[61:07] but instead of you know oh instead of 100% return 
this year or 150 or whatever we're at so far in  
[61:13] 2024 you know 150% isn't good enough for me so 
I'm actually going to try to go 300% or 500% and  
[61:21] I'm going to be distracted by this instead 
of focusing my time and energy on learning  
[61:26] it securing it protecting it I'm going to go buy 
this shebe Eno coin or 5x micro strategy leverage  
[61:34] play because I I want things faster than they're 
coming right now so those are the distractions  
[61:39] people get distracted every cycle they get burned 
usually but you kind of have to touch the stove  
[61:43] to to get burned before you learn and that's you 
know that's kind of part of my show is I want to  
[61:47] prevent people from having to touch the stove 
by just giving so many dire warnings of what's  
[61:54] coming and so they can have a little better 
understanding of what's kind of happening big  
[61:57] picture but the second piece of advice would be 
to secure it right because Bitcoin itself if you  
[62:03] do it properly it is the best battery it is the 
best place to store your time and energy but if  
[62:08] you're not securing it properly like that's that 
that'll be the difference between you having it in  
[62:13] in 20 years and not so I usually tell people 
to take 5% of their stack their portfolio in  
[62:19] Bitcoin and invest in security and people might 
think that that's pretty high but it's a onetime  
[62:25] thing it's not like a management fee where 
you pay it every month or every year to your  
[62:28] financial advisor or you pay Bank fees every year 
to your bank or every month it's a it's a onetime  
[62:34] thing you set it up you secure it you might it 
might be some ongoing cost but not 5% of it so  
[62:39] if you got $1,000 worth a Bitcoin you take 50 
bucks you know you probably don't need anything  
[62:44] at that point you maybe get a phone wallet you 
maybe just download Sparrow th worth of bitcoin  
[62:49] you're probably fine you get $100,000 worth of 
bitcoin though you or one Bitcoin in this sense  
[62:55] you should be taking at least $5,000 and investing 
either your time or your own money into securing  
[63:02] that because just think about it and I know me 
and you talked about this on my show yesterday  
[63:10] but like if you if you compare it to Banks like 
think about a bank they have security cameras they  
[63:16] have security guards they have it teams they 
have Brinks trucks they have all this stuff  
[63:23] to protect the money that's in their Bank right 
and so you're like okay well I'm not a bank but  
[63:29] then you consider like three things number one the 
banks have insurance so even if somebody broke in  
[63:34] robbed a bank they're they can get it the money 
back probably the next week they have insurance  
[63:40] number two they're holding other people's money 
it doesn't mean as much to them and number three  
[63:44] is that they're holding fake money they're holding 
Fiat with leaks everywhere that's disintegrating  
[63:49] before our eyes you're holding Bitcoin which 
is a real asset you don't have any insurance  
[63:57] on that Bitcoin probably unless there I I missed 
something here but I don't have any insurance on  
[64:01] my Bitcoin and what was the other one insurance 
and it's yours you're not holding somebody else's  
[64:09] money you're holding your own money you're holding 
the the wealth that you're going to have in your  
[64:12] in your family for generations to come so not 
only should you be securing it just as well as  
[64:18] a bank does I in my opinion I think you should 
be higher than the bank security for it yeah  
[64:26] by the way there is um a German friend of mine I 
think he has the world's first Bitcoin insurance  
[64:33] I I don't know what what exactly this is but 
uh yeah I think he ensures if you have it on a  
[64:40] hardw wallet and uh he ensures against like fire 
damage and and stuff like that but it's a hard  
[64:48] hard business model I it is because how do you 
really prove that you don't have it anymore yeah  
[64:54] true and so that there's a lot of moving pieces 
but I actually um I scheduled a call with him so I  
[65:00] will have him on the podcast because I was really 
curious because I never heard that before and it's  
[65:05] such a normal thing to do usually an insurance for 
money or insurance for for uh um for Treasure or  
[65:11] something like that uh but yeah it's it will be 
interesting on on a hardware wallet to to ensure  
[65:16] that uh and I heard the price like three three a 
month or something like that so I was like yeah  
[65:22] I don't know if there's a lot of Bitcoin on there 
could be bad business model but yeah uh sorry for  
[65:28] that tension but um you you're 100% right we we 
should take care really good about our Bitcoin and  
[65:35] also being aware of when you have a lot of Bitcoin 
maybe consider spending some money to educate  
[65:43] yourself to invest in in in good um Hardware in 
good software uh that you can actually use uh use  
[65:50] the open source ones um if if you don't want to 
do it uh Ed try to uh buy an advisor try to buy  
[65:58] a service that fit you but I would encourage 
everyone to at least try to educate yourself  
[66:05] like take out a weekend take out a week where 
like let's let's let's dive into that topic uh  
[66:10] there is no exemptions no matter how young or old 
you are uh it's it's possible if you can read and  
[66:17] if you can operate a computer you can operate your 
own self- custody that there's just no excuse to  
[66:22] that and I think it's a great message especially 
for the bull market uh and as we as you said also  
[66:29] yesterday on on your podcast um treated it as 
it would be 10 extra value for from the day then  
[66:36] people are more prone to that so if you have now 
one Bitcoin consider that Bitcoin to be a million  
[66:42] because we are now almost at 100K consider that 
Bitcoin already being worth $1 millionar uh maybe  
[66:49] you take it a little bit more serious and also the 
inheritance because I think a lot of bitcoiners  
[66:54] don't have an really inheritance plan and the 
family has no clue on how to access that Bitcoin  
[66:59] so educate your family uh even though maybe they 
don't get Bitcoin but educate them on how they  
[67:06] would get to your Bitcoin or set some professional 
things up there are a lot of services out there so  
[67:11] yeah uh educate yourself in this B market yeah and 
I think that's a big one you're you're absolutely  
[67:16] right I think that you know you're you're probably 
not going to go from zero to a multi signature  
[67:21] setup in a weekend but the one thing that you can 
do is just actually get a baseline understanding  
[67:27] of it so let's say you're a a you know a physicist 
or a doctor and you know you're like okay well I'm  
[67:35] a doctor so I'm pretty smart I should be able to 
figure this out myself this can't be too complex  
[67:40] so you're like okay well would I rather spend 
$5,000 or would I rather take you know it'll  
[67:44] probably take me 10 20 hours you have to value 
your time as if you were going to work instead  
[67:49] so you have to factor in how many hours you'd have 
to spend to get to the point of understanding it  
[67:55] of getting the devices of having things perfect 
if that's 20 hours and you make $500 an hour like  
[68:00] that's well and that's well above the $5,000 
threshold where is if you just get a baseline  
[68:06] understanding of it so you can at least navigate 
and then you hire somebody to help you with it you  
[68:10] save time and you save actual money right because 
you have to value your time in terms of the  
[68:15] learning process and then you once you have some 
Bitcoin you have a secure a baseline at least and  
[68:21] then as time goes on you get more Bitcoin you get 
a better understanding that's when you move to a p  
[68:25] phrase that's when you move to a multi signature 
like you have you have to take the slow you have  
[68:30] you have a have to have a baseline you have to 
secure it but you have to take it slow and uh kind  
[68:36] of what you were saying there along the lines of 
10x like just just think about if you had a a cold  
[68:41] card and you're just kind of Loosey Goosey with 
it maybe it's in your safe maybe it's on your desk  
[68:45] maybe it's on your bed uh bed stand and we just 
talked about 20 minutes ago where we're going to  
[68:50] move into a situation where bitcoin's probably 
going to be a million dollars it could be 100  
[68:55] million one day nothing's going to change in that 
Bitcoin other than the Fiat price and everything  
[69:00] else being repriced by that so if you had a if you 
had a briefcase full of a million dollars in cash  
[69:06] or aund million do in cash would you leave that in 
your safe would you leave that on your desk would  
[69:11] you leave that on your kitchen table probably not 
you probably wouldn't even have it at your house  
[69:17] You' be paying somebody to look after that and I 
think that just because of the illusion that they  
[69:21] feed us that this thing's only worth this right 
now the only thing that's going to change that is  
[69:25] time and as time goes on people are going to see 
the the impacts of that and it's going to play  
[69:30] out 100% um we're coming closer to the end uh so I 
want to have before we come to the question I ask  
[69:39] all the time and the end routin question uh one 
more thing uh that I'm really curious always about  
[69:45] how how did Bitcoin change you like what what did 
Bitcoin impact uh in in your life if anything at  
[69:53] all I mean it it's changed everything in my life 
everything and that's what Bitcoin does it's going  
[69:59] to reprice everything and it basically takes the 
old system that we had and flips it on its head  
[70:04] the exact opposite of everything that we've ever 
known before but in terms of like the first thing  
[70:10] I was in the account and so I saw once I realized 
what Bitcoin was once I saw an open permissionless  
[70:19] Ledger that anybody could access at any time 
that's basically what accountants do we look at  
[70:24] ledgers we look at at transactions we verify them 
Bitcoin itself is like the next progression of  
[70:30] accounting it's the triple entry accounting where 
you have debits and credits and I'm probably going  
[70:35] to lose some people here but then you have you 
keep track of everything you owe somebody you have  
[70:39] money you you keep track of that through a double 
entry accounting system and the the thing you need  
[70:45] on top of that though is Auditors so Public public 
companies if they have debits and credits and they  
[70:52] have all their financial records you need an 
auditor to come in and make sure that that's  
[70:56] accurate that's what accountants do or Auditors 
anyways but with Bitcoin once I realize that the  
[71:02] network itself is just a ledger it keeps track 
of who has what and every 10 minutes the network  
[71:09] audits itself so that was my first like okay I I'm 
you know accounting is probably going to be around  
[71:14] in 10 years but my job might not be there this 
industry is going to look completely different  
[71:21] and I don't know what I'm going to do in Bitcoin 
I have no idea but I know that I have to be part  
[71:25] of this because I could see it that this is going 
to change everything about the world including the  
[71:30] industry that I was in and I had to be part of 
it and since then it's literally changed every  
[71:35] aspect of my thinking of my day-to-day my spending 
habits my health everything so that's it's changed  
[71:42] everything I love that yeah it it changes a lot 
in in people's life uh and it's a great Insight  
[71:49] that you also got like Bitcoin because of that 
accounting and you're like oh like my job might  
[71:53] be around and and like that really really cool 
perfect then one question that each and every  
[71:58] one of my guests gets what can we learn from you 
besides Bitcoin what can you learn from me well my  
[72:05] Channel's called the 88 SATs Channel R everybody 
asked why it's called that and the reason is  
[72:10] because we had our golf company king golf uh 
KNG Golf and so we had a decent sized audience  
[72:16] of golfers of people that we knew on Instagram 
and I was getting into Bitcoin and I was like  
[72:21] I'm I'm tired of this narrative around you know 
very shortterm shorttime preference uh people see  
[72:26] it as like this Ponzi scheme or number go up very 
fast you cash out I want to change the perception  
[72:31] here so I I want made it my goal to try to find 
88 people that's what we announced we're going to  
[72:36] try to find 88 people we're going to everybody's 
going to contribute some some Bitcoin we're going  
[72:42] to set up a multi signature wallet and we're gonna 
have a 10-year goal we're going to hold on to this  
[72:48] Bitcoin for 10 years and at the end of it we're 
going to buy our own golf course so that that  
[72:53] was the idea there and uh you know I thought this 
might happen this might not you know I I threw a  
[72:58] lot of ideas at the wall some stick some don't 
but within two months I think we had 88 people  
[73:04] with Bitcoin about 90% of them had never heard 
of Bitcoin or own Bitcoin before so I I got them  
[73:09] to actually set up on an exchange buy the Bitcoin 
send the Bitcoin to the wallet they couldn't just  
[73:14] give us cash and kind of fast forward that step 
so that's what the 88 SATs came from and uh very  
[73:21] successful and we we actually started buying it 
we launched January 3rd 2023 the price was about  
[73:29] under $20,000 per Bitcoin when we all bought our 
Bitcoin and so it's 5x since then in two years  
[73:37] so people are like they're really happy obviously 
with their their their small investment but they  
[73:41] can see the vision here they can see the long-term 
time preference and so I'd say what they can learn  
[73:46] from me is like that doesn't have to be golf 
that doesn't have to be specific to golf or a  
[73:53] golf course but apply that into your own life if 
you have a if if you're have a church if you have  
[73:59] a community if you have a dojo club like Implement 
Bitcoin into that sell people on a vision get them  
[74:07] to buy into it you know you can't do that in the 
Fiat world where everybody puts $200 in and in  
[74:11] 10 years you think you're going to get a golf 
course out of that that that's going to turn  
[74:15] into nothing never mind a golf course but if you 
just think about that and you and you apply that  
[74:20] to anything in your life like I think that's going 
to be such a huge thing in terms of like different  
[74:25] funds different projects people are going to use 
Bitcoin to save or jump you know put something  
[74:31] into life that never existed before so it just 
changes your whole perception and I think that  
[74:38] bitcoiners especially this stage of the game 
they have the ability to make lifechanging uh  
[74:43] decisions like that with with people and educate 
them and get them thinking about different uh  
[74:48] Bitcoin differently the whole thing it's really 
fascinating when we think about that what what  
[74:54] Bitcoin actually can do do on an individual 
level and what implications that then has on  
[74:59] society level if you just like take your life 
and my life to example of that maybe we extreme  
[75:04] but extrapolate that out just with like 20% of 
society this this is huge uh and I think people  
[75:14] I just always come back to that thing like we are 
not bullish enough it's on on the implications and  
[75:20] the the output of of Bitcoin yeah really cool we 
have inter in the podcast we had a previous guest  
[75:25] is asking a question for the next guest without 
knowing who the next guest actually is and your  
[75:29] question from the previous guest is are you mining 
Bitcoin if no why not if yes why and how right  
[75:36] here they're kind of annoying oh is that a bit a 
bit a I got two of them I got one right here and  
[75:42] then one where is this right there NOP over here 
somewhere right there oh yeah I see it so two bit  
[75:48] axes in here I haven't hit a a block reward yet 
that I'm aware of so yes I am mining Bitcoin this  
[75:55] is kind of new I I got them about 6 months ago I 
don't think that uh you know I'm not banking on  
[76:01] a 3.125 Bitcoin to show up in my wallet but it was 
very interesting to kind of go through the process  
[76:06] of connecting it to the network connecting it to 
a pool um putting my address in there and one day  
[76:12] I might wake up and there might be 3.125 Bitcoin 
in my wallet which would be absolutely insane so  
[76:18] the answer is yes I am Min Bitcoin I'd like to do 
it on a b scale I think that especially here in  
[76:21] Manitoba where it's like minus 30 in a month like 
people will be using Bitcoin mining as in replace  
[76:27] of a furnace or something like that where it makes 
sense to subsidize the energy costs I'm actually  
[76:32] also looking right now a little bit more into 
mining uh because there's some interesting use  
[76:37] cases especially if if you have a business uh you 
might can uh invest profits into Bitcoin mining  
[76:43] which can offset some tax and stuff like that 
uh so it it might be interesting because my my  
[76:50] thinking is like before I give it the government I 
rather give it to bitcoin Miners and reinvest the  
[76:57] money um and do something with that especially if 
I can maybe even benefit from that financially if  
[77:04] the Bitcoin mining service is good um uh and I can 
secure the network I contribute to the security um  
[77:12] but my just question is like how do I do it and 
that's where I just really uh go a little bit  
[77:19] deeper now because bidex is great for learning 
about about it for pretty much exactly yeah and  
[77:25] the the chance of actually hitting a block is 
so low it's it's a little bit like playing the  
[77:30] lottery I guess it's better than playing the 
lottery uh you're also probably even higher  
[77:36] than playing in the lottery uh but it's uh it it's 
it's not for for actually a business case but I'm  
[77:44] really curious of like uh how how I could do it 
and I just try to inform myself because I don't  
[77:50] I cannot set it up myself here why we got podcast 
we're not actually uh working on electrical things  
[77:59] yeah first of all that and you then also have to 
have access to cheap electricity yeah uh and uh if  
[78:06] you want to really want to do it you you kind of 
have to do it on a little bit of a bigger scale uh  
[78:10] and and and do that and what if like you you have 
a job to do and then oh like there's a Bitcoin man  
[78:15] going broke like you have to maintain it you maybe 
have to replace something and and repair it and  
[78:20] all that stuff like it's it's an own business 
if you want to do Bitcoin mining full-time  
[78:25] like that's it like that's your business there's 
a lot to do in in there so uh and that's why I'm  
[78:31] kind of thinking okay how can I contribute to 
the network how can I benefit from that also and  
[78:37] do it in an economic W viable sense with doing 
I don't know two hours per day or one hour per  
[78:45] day uh maintenance and stuff like that or even 
like five hours per week would be too much for  
[78:50] me because I really want to focus on the podcast 
yeah so yeah I'm really interested in that right  
[78:55] perfect yeah then uh so you want to say 
something to that no I was just going to  
[78:59] say like I I talked about you know being here 
in Canada where it's it's cold for six months  
[79:04] a year and I don't think even though we do have 
cheap electricity here in Manitoba like we have  
[79:09] hydr powerered energy and before Bitcoin I had 
no idea about energy I just knew that when you  
[79:14] flipped a light switch the lights came on but 
I've been absolutely fascinated by energy since  
[79:18] learning about Bitcoin but uh you know it doesn't 
really make sense for me to set up 10 miners in  
[79:22] the yard and and try to make Bitcoin off of that 
you know you'll get some non kyc Bitcoin which  
[79:27] people think will be valuable but the real thing 
for me and I think that this is where it's going  
[79:31] to go like mainstream and that's why I don't hold 
any like mining stocks or anything because I think  
[79:35] it's going to be so decentralized but like right 
now the furnace is running in here because there's  
[79:40] snow on the ground so right now if you think about 
that electricity that we're paying for it's going  
[79:45] into this furnace and that's about it the furnace 
isn't earning me any money it's it's pumping out  
[79:50] heat it's sending it through the vents but I'm 
just paying it whereas if if you replace furnace  
[79:55] with a couple Bitcoin miners it's still going to 
be pumping heat through the vents it's still going  
[79:59] to be heating this house but it's subsidizing the 
costs that I'm paying for it so in that sense it  
[80:04] makes it in that when you look at it that way it 
just makes a whole lot of sense and usually when  
[80:08] things make sense it eventually catches on so 
I think that probably in the next couple years  
[80:13] like I'll replace my furnace with Bitcoin miners 
but this was just kind of my first start into  
[80:18] it absolutely yeah it's also a long long journey 
for me really cool thank you so much Jo for being  
[80:25] on before I let you go where can people find you 
ask your questions see your show where's where  
[80:30] where are you reachable so the the Channel's 
called 88 SATs radio you can just type that  
[80:35] into YouTube and the show that I do is called The 
Daily Bitcoin journey and I do it every morning  
[80:41] at 9:00 A.M eastern time on this side of the pond 
and uh that's probably it if you if you like the  
[80:47] golf stuff if you're a golfer you can go to king 
golf K&G golf.car and products on there so that's  
[80:54] kind of my we got the Bitcoin stuff and we got the 
golf stuff two things that I enjoy doing and make  
[80:59] a little bit of money on it to at least uh feed 
Arie here is that is that a dog he's sleeping yeah  
[81:07] thank you so much CH for being on also thank 
you so much for everyone that is watching and  
[81:11] listening for joining us today as always I'll 
be back tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
