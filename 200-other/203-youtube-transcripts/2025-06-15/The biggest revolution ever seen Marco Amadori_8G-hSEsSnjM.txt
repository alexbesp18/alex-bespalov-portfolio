[00:00] in the north of Italy there is a Bitcoin
[00:02] part start yourself a Bitcoin Valley
[00:05] it's really fun rewarding to make a lot
[00:07] of friends you participate in a
[00:08] revolution and while the revolution
[00:11] develops gaining Freedom if you wait a
[00:13] bit your volatility program will is we
[00:16] we see more uh financial institution
[00:19] getting their hands on
[00:21] bitcoin I heard that Bitcoin Valley like
[00:25] I think uh as I got it described it's a
[00:27] little bit like the Italian version of
[00:29] of the Bitcoin Beach it started before
[00:31] Bitcoin beach I was
[00:34] a technologist researcher in uh what is
[00:38] now called artificial intelligence in a
[00:40] research facility in near in North Italy
[00:44] uh the name is foundation Bruno Kesler
[00:47] found Bruno Kesler
[00:49] fbk and I was involved in um web of data
[00:53] research which is the idea the original
[00:56] idea from Tim Berner Lee of um internet
[01:00] as a distributed database of different
[01:03] computers where data is linked by
[01:06] curated semantic one of the Curious
[01:09] Thing of this my involvement is that the
[01:12] the semantic web was DED as a web fre
[01:16] 3.0 is not is not any anywhere near web
[01:19] three of nowadays which is a buz word
[01:22] mean meaningless buz but it was
[01:25] interesting I was interested in Bitcoin
[01:27] because I was invited to to have tedex
[01:31] which is a like a
[01:33] yeah formal speech about Technologies
[01:37] and things that you want to share with
[01:38] Humanity in my speech which is in on
[01:41] YouTube you can find it about Mar
[01:45] madori was about uh cognitive Surplus it
[01:49] it is in Italian and the final part of
[01:51] my speech was about Bitcoin as an
[01:53] example of op source code with um open
[01:56] data
[01:58] transaction was just curiosity I was
[02:01] involved in the uh I was asked by the
[02:05] the main head of the research center to
[02:08] have a internal speech about Bitcoin
[02:12] Technologies for the different research
[02:14] this was late uh
[02:17] 2014 while my speech was in late 2012
[02:21] about Bitcoin so it was one of the first
[02:23] in my area knowing and studying about
[02:27] Bitcoin and um while I Was preparing
[02:30] this uh internal speech for the Research
[02:33] Unit I asked a local pizzeria near the
[02:37] research center if if you want to
[02:39] participate in this research about
[02:42] Bitcoin and I I asked if you want to
[02:44] accept Bitcoin just just for fun not for
[02:47] any reason and it started like that just
[02:51] for uh for fun uh a local
[02:55] journalist interviewed the the local
[02:58] keria and so from other uh venues in R
[03:03] which is a town near This research uh
[03:07] Center asked me if they could
[03:09] participate you in was a PO and vagan
[03:13] restaurant in 200 late
[03:16] 2014 and after that other Merchants
[03:19] brick and mortar Merchant asked to
[03:22] bitcoin because he started like local
[03:26] experimental research thing
[03:29] nothing more um precise he started for
[03:34] fun and he gave us a an idea of business
[03:38] idea in fact we started the company two
[03:41] two years later after I went out to the
[03:43] research center and um the first company
[03:46] was in Bitcoin was about making software
[03:49] over uh Bitcoin we started different uh
[03:52] different products but people uh came to
[03:56] visit us not for our fine
[04:00] uh code or op Source efforts but for the
[04:04] people accepting Bitcoin in the town so
[04:07] a lot of more people were involved in
[04:10] the community in uh in the world I think
[04:14] the oldest was AR in Netherland but they
[04:18] had uh the Fons in 2000 when they hosted
[04:24] rer there was the big cash Mass so they
[04:29] they went off the rather a bit we we are
[04:31] still um proud and Alive and Kicking we
[04:35] had the first commercial lightting
[04:38] Network coning in the summer of 2000
[04:41] when we hosted a local RGB developer
[04:44] meetings and we we tried everyone in
[04:47] this Pub it was not the the real first
[04:50] transaction of light n in a pub which um
[04:55] happened in Berlin but happened in
[04:57] Berlin with l um laptops we had the
[05:02] first real transaction in a commercial
[05:04] um venue with
[05:06] commercial product uh outside drinking
[05:11] in outside this this local bar noways
[05:15] there are a lot of venues Ino accepting
[05:20] Bitcoin lot of them are accepting liting
[05:23] Network like 99% of them are setting
[05:27] directly Network and also applying a
[05:31] discount they are applying a discount to
[05:34] uh like from 10% to
[05:37] 22% in a different location and this
[05:40] Chang changed over the years H the first
[05:43] Bitcoin valy years where we were
[05:46] accepting Bitcoin directly on the
[05:50] blockchain on the time chain which was
[05:53] insane but the initial distribution of
[05:56] merchants were
[05:58] converting uh coin to Euro like 80% in
[06:02] the first years were converting to Euro
[06:06] so accepting this coin but not keeping
[06:08] Bitcoin nowadays it's more than the
[06:12] opposite like
[06:14] 97% are keeping Bitcoin and there there
[06:18] the discount was not our idea was an
[06:21] idea for for from um one of the first pu
[06:25] set Bitcoin to cheer uh the Bitcoin
[06:30] 2000 wanted to give back to the
[06:33] community I don't know as you wish or
[06:36] simply getting more Bitcoin without
[06:40] fees which is one of the main reasons to
[06:43] accept Bitcoin you you are keep getting
[06:45] Bitcoin uh zero fees or if you made it
[06:49] your
[06:50] discount and um it was it is really cool
[06:55] because we are now in RTO like the
[06:57] second uh cycle
[07:00] of um success stories from the
[07:03] merchant so we are um we have the the
[07:07] legends of the first merchant some of
[07:10] them has stopped working or working uh
[07:15] very liter because they they accumulated
[07:20] a lot of
[07:21] satosi and there are starting also the
[07:24] the second cycle so the merchant started
[07:27] in last years
[07:30] and when um started directly with light
[07:33] Network so recent merchants and they
[07:37] already have their their success story
[07:39] because they started when Bitcoin was
[07:41] like 20,000 Euro and nowadays are like
[07:46] three times surprise when they started
[07:49] accumulating satosi in exchange of the
[07:52] product or
[07:54] Services we have uh some strange uh
[07:57] Bitcoin tourism too
[08:00] people are uh coming by to visit us to
[08:03] try to to see if if it is if it is
[08:07] real and it is real
[08:10] since like 10 years now and um some
[08:15] people also moved there like um one
[08:19] argentin one one Brazilian guy decided
[08:22] to uh after visiting roetto for vacation
[08:27] in coming to Italy they said let's say
[08:30] this bit Valley and they they F fell in
[08:33] love and remain there and we are not
[08:37] involved with local politics too much we
[08:40] had some results in past years we had a
[08:44] local um politician I don't know how to
[08:48] translate it's a motion like a
[08:51] small
[08:53] low uh a small proposal that made the
[08:57] local territory like it's like a
[08:59] province of Italy in thiso north of
[09:02] Italy where we are located to promote
[09:05] after we promote Bitcoin in the region
[09:10] we had some uh results after that some
[09:14] local guys started a mining
[09:17] company and they are pretty much unknown
[09:22] but they are uh really nice because they
[09:24] have like 5% of the entire world dash
[09:28] power H 100% renewable from um
[09:33] hydroelectric
[09:35] power and this we are in a mountain
[09:37] reion in the HS in Italy and we have a
[09:40] lot of hydro hyro plants so yeah we have
[09:44] we are you are a fertile territory we
[09:47] still Italy we are not some um marvelous
[09:51] land of freedom but in the north of
[09:54] Italy there there is a Bitcoin part
[09:59] sating since a lot of years that's
[10:01] amazing I love it and I think uh it's
[10:03] also shines a light on bitcoin as a
[10:05] Grassroots movement right it's like
[10:07] Bitcoin is not something topped down
[10:09] it's something that grows from the
[10:10] people up there's project starting that
[10:13] there's happening stuff um is do you
[10:15] also see it like that as a as the start
[10:17] of a Grassroots movement that eventually
[10:20] whole Italy will will be orange build
[10:22] with the small start of a community
[10:24] maybe like in south of Italy there's
[10:27] another Community starting uh and maybe
[10:30] something like in Salvador can happen
[10:32] over the long run where then all of the
[10:33] sudden higher politicians pick it up and
[10:35] like oh we could do Italy there's a
[10:37] whole over the whole nation something
[10:39] like that do you see something similar
[10:41] it will be really slower than that
[10:44] because in in Salvador you have direct
[10:48] involvement from the the power the
[10:50] political power we uh did the Bitcoin
[10:54] Valley without real involvement of
[10:57] politics because they did
[10:59] understood yet Bitcoin this will
[11:02] probably change for sure because the
[11:06] they will when they realize Bitcoin is a
[11:08] is a thing they probably realize they
[11:11] live in the Bitcoin Valley and will
[11:13] start to try to exploit it but I um I
[11:21] will welcome that because I'm not tied
[11:24] to be the the real father on want to
[11:28] have a statue or something like that I
[11:30] would like to change the the land where
[11:34] I live so everything that U could fav
[11:38] that it will be welcomed our major is
[11:41] not like the Lugano major he didn't
[11:45] understand through Bitcoin yet but we we
[11:49] have election soon so probably let's see
[11:53] if the new or verto major will start to
[11:57] leverage Bitcoin Valley or
[11:59] not it should it should be a good idea
[12:02] for for for him or her but um we are not
[12:07] too too much concerned about that we we
[12:10] will surely support our local politician
[12:13] that want to understand Bitcoin but we
[12:16] are mostly focused on the citiz and can
[12:19] understand Bitcoin without asking asking
[12:21] themsel if they if Bitcoin uh bring them
[12:26] votes or not it will bring them um
[12:29] Financial Freedom or keep them um far
[12:35] from
[12:36] slowly decay in poverty like uh by
[12:40] keeping Euro so we are just doing some
[12:43] for what Bitcoin valid is concerned we
[12:46] are just we have a local ex exchange on
[12:49] um on the street you can enter buy and
[12:52] sell Bitcoin since uh 200 you can could
[12:56] come ask for how to use Bitcoin how to
[12:59] give Bitcoin to your son to your kids to
[13:02] your nephew how to to keep them to have
[13:07] secure them and we are uh we are
[13:11] Bitcoin not see yes Bitcoin maximalist
[13:14] like kind of um mostly um shitcoin
[13:19] minimalist I
[13:21] think yes uh since the beginning our
[13:24] company was called in 2016 in Bitcoin
[13:30] and where when the other people were
[13:33] hiding Bitcoin inside blockchain chain
[13:38] Block Chain something block another
[13:41] thing we started at the first by um we
[13:46] wanted to be the the
[13:49] clean not um woring part of Bitcoin but
[13:55] uh spreading anyway uh uh Archy ideas so
[14:00] we are uh quite Anarchist like something
[14:04] like that so we will um take your all
[14:07] the end and bring gently to the crypto
[14:11] Anarchist Utopia amazing so a lot of um
[14:15] of people come um and P by our shop we
[14:19] we also sell some merchandising we also
[14:21] have a software company uh which are is
[14:25] doing the software developing on over
[14:27] Bitcoin uh Technologies we were involved
[14:31] in different areas from world to point
[14:35] of sale we we did our um Bitcoin uh
[14:39] merchant services because we started
[14:42] before like btca was a
[14:45] thing H we started similar to BTC pay by
[14:49] um mimicking the bit pay
[14:53] API thinking like uh btcpay that it was
[14:57] a thing that people or were using that
[15:01] apis they were not but uh so probably we
[15:06] we we have a similar engine which is a
[15:08] property is not open source just for
[15:11] because we uh is is just too much work
[15:16] very is
[15:17] pay
[15:19] so we are not interested in polishing
[15:22] too much to to publish it for now maybe
[15:27] it will change but it's not a
[15:29] a big issue a big thing and it's mostly
[15:34] customized for uh
[15:36] some C customer which have maybe some
[15:41] specific
[15:42] or particular need for some feature some
[15:46] obscure feature we published um a
[15:49] different kind of Open Source Code
[15:51] because I I come from I was a Deon
[15:54] developer kind was involved involved in
[15:58] creation of the live which is a system
[16:01] that will start the a Linux system from
[16:05] from scratch from like a readon media
[16:07] from my USB key something like that so
[16:11] I'm involved I was involved I'm still
[16:14] little involved in some open source
[16:16] project so so we are we are Bitcoin fan
[16:19] so we are doing this company not for
[16:21] money but for for um for ourself to have
[16:26] um it'sit friendly land around us that's
[16:29] amazing this was the the the initial
[16:31] idea because Bitcoin Valley was like a
[16:35] sub product nowadays we are um trying to
[16:39] push it uh a little bit more but it was
[16:43] like a sub prodct for our developers to
[16:47] because we were one of the first company
[16:50] in Italy to pay developers directly in
[16:52] Bitcoin and we wanted them to spend in
[16:55] the city so they should be able to spend
[16:58] the for having a beer like that and um
[17:02] to to enjoy the city and this was the
[17:05] the first one of the first me movers for
[17:08] for us nowadays the the the the software
[17:11] company is a less we are less focused on
[17:15] that and more focused on bitcoin Valley
[17:18] because uh we are we want some years ago
[17:22] we with thought that since it was like
[17:25] kind I easy for us to create a bit valy
[17:29] would be easy for other people around
[17:31] the world to create one so we didn't
[17:34] invest it in uh in the twi Valley at
[17:36] first because we we're thinking we are
[17:39] not so special and instead we we saw
[17:43] after some years that we are still
[17:44] special we we were are not just start
[17:47] the early we we were kind of some some
[17:51] special and so so nowadays we we are
[17:55] tending to be interested more in the is
[17:59] this thing which we were completely
[18:03] underestimated at start definitely and I
[18:06] think Bitcoin in general is just good
[18:08] for business like if you start something
[18:11] and you do it with the sole purpose to
[18:14] do something good for Bitcoin and
[18:17] something like a a project like the
[18:19] Bitcoin Valley starting something is
[18:20] really good for Bitcoin this will bring
[18:23] automatically also good business uh to
[18:25] the people involved to the area to the
[18:27] location and it will be good like you
[18:30] talked before about the politicians and
[18:32] the election coming up it would be
[18:34] amazing for an mayor also to say like oh
[18:37] we we should embrace Bitcoin we have
[18:39] this Bitcoin Valley thing uh we have
[18:41] local businesses accepting Bitcoin why
[18:43] shouldn't we also accept Bitcoin there's
[18:46] no reason to not do it and this is
[18:48] something really beautiful that we can
[18:50] see as here in the Bitcoin Valley we can
[18:52] see it as you mentioned in Lugano we can
[18:54] see it in Salvador and I think there
[18:57] right now there's like small projects
[18:59] all over the world there're like there
[19:01] something there's there something
[19:02] there's there something it all has like
[19:05] unique stories behind them uh but as
[19:07] they get bigger and better they multiply
[19:11] uh they will hopefully come also to
[19:13] Austria I don't see something now but I
[19:15] hope they are coming to AUST at some
[19:17] point also sure sure maybe I have to
[19:19] start something there are some
[19:20] difference I I've been in lugan recently
[19:23] for the P the difference I saw is Lugano
[19:27] it came from the the top
[19:29] so they add bigger numbers than us
[19:32] because um we are still have like 100
[19:36] merchants in Bitcoin Valley they started
[19:39] like in a couple of month they reached
[19:41] the 600 Merchants but all or practically
[19:46] all of their Merchants are not keeping
[19:49] Bitcoin they are um selling right on the
[19:53] transaction Bitcoin so in Bitcoin Valley
[19:56] Merchants are keeping Bitcoin we are not
[19:58] uh pushing too much we are trying to
[20:01] grow um organically so when a merchant
[20:06] is registered we try to involve it in
[20:09] the community by organizing a local
[20:11] satosi if the venue permits that or any
[20:15] way to uh bring some clients to the the
[20:20] merchant otherwise not not only they are
[20:23] not interested in keeping Bitcoin but
[20:25] the people uh who can be Bitcoin will
[20:29] not paying Bitcoin in Lugano a lot of
[20:31] bitcoiner paid with credit cards because
[20:34] they had no incentive at all to pay in
[20:36] Bitcoin they not giving them a discount
[20:39] they know that if they they pay Bitcoin
[20:42] they will sell instantly Bitcoin for
[20:45] Fiat so it's uh it's similar but it's
[20:49] different we saw um bitcoiner more eager
[20:54] to spend their Bitcoin if they they had
[20:58] discount if if they know that their
[21:01] merchant are keeping theit their the
[21:03] Bitcoin they spend to to the the shop or
[21:07] for the services so this is this is an
[21:10] issue at first it was not because Noy
[21:13] bcoin wants to pay in their City the
[21:17] first time to to have a the
[21:20] feeling but after the first one they
[21:23] will not give them the Bitcoin they will
[21:26] pay in Euro or in Frank Swiss French or
[21:32] other
[21:33] currency in fat currency because they
[21:35] want to keep the Bitcoin so if you are a
[21:38] merchant and want to have the Bitcoin
[21:40] for your from your local bitcoiners
[21:43] please uh give a discount and please let
[21:48] know your customer that you are keeping
[21:51] the Bitcoin strangly or not so strangly
[21:54] they will give you their Bitcoin if you
[21:57] are willing to kick to hold hold h of
[22:01] course like because bitcoiners just
[22:03] don't want to sell the Bitcoin to
[22:05] someone that like dumps it to feat it's
[22:07] like almost like selling Bitcoin in a
[22:09] way corre but if you accept it Bitcoin
[22:12] and you have it in the ecosystem it's
[22:14] really really cool where do you see
[22:16] actually the the state of Bitcoin as a
[22:19] medium of exchange because right now I
[22:21] think we are still in the adopting phase
[22:23] of store value I agre I agree still in
[22:26] the adoption phase how do you see like
[22:28] right now how far no no I agree with
[22:31] with with your vision uh we are still un
[22:35] experimenting in Bitcoin valid because
[22:38] Bitcoin is still in the the price
[22:40] Discovery phase it will not become a
[22:44] medium of exchange so soon but it is a
[22:48] technology of exchange since day Zero
[22:52] and also in some area it's a accounting
[22:56] Tool uh because uh miners are not paid
[23:00] in dollars or Euro are paid in
[23:04] Bitcoin so it's a bit strange literacy
[23:08] um wise because something like Bitcoin
[23:13] should pass from these phases res server
[23:16] of value the meaning of exchange unit of
[23:20] account and but Bitcoin is from the zero
[23:24] technology for exchange and also
[23:29] account unity in some particular area I
[23:31] think Bitcoin value will grow because uh
[23:35] because people around the Bitcoin valy
[23:37] have Bitcoins and after a while you want
[23:41] to also spend them and it's better to
[23:44] spend them where there is a discount
[23:47] that to exchange and pay in if you if
[23:50] you can but I agree with you uh we will
[23:53] see Bitcoin as a medium of
[23:56] exchange I think in not
[23:59] before a popular mean of exchange and
[24:02] not before like 15 years of 20 I
[24:08] think ER but for some um marketing
[24:12] reasons for of of if you have a curated
[24:16] Community or if your um zone is like a
[24:20] tourist Zone like uh Italy most of place
[24:23] in Italy are tourist
[24:26] locations H this could work for sure it
[24:29] could work also in privacy related
[24:33] business maybe if I want to not let know
[24:37] my wife that I I have a another lover I
[24:41] will buy my flowers from uh Oro between
[24:45] Val shop that's we have one that sell
[24:49] flowers without keeping your having an
[24:51] entry on your credit card okay so I
[24:54] think it's like um or or say f or um
[24:59] tourist zone or um
[25:02] sandboxing experimental Zone which is a
[25:06] kind of like a bit Valley it's not a
[25:09] real sandbox yet
[25:11] but we are trying to have some
[25:14] uh some exemption or some um way to
[25:19] interact with the public administration
[25:22] in Bitcoin more we had one of the first
[25:24] the public administration PA accepting
[25:27] Bitcoin here in between Valley just
[25:30] cancelled some month ago
[25:34] because the centralization of the
[25:37] Italian government reach us H our Lo
[25:41] Community were able for a years able to
[25:44] pay a local Canen for schools in
[25:49] Bitcoin and then like I said the Central
[25:54] State um payment system came and uh it
[25:58] was a like a step back from our local
[26:01] public um administration pay payment
[26:04] system oh okay okay really really cool
[26:07] and you also said you with lenux and
[26:09] open source development how did this
[26:11] influence your thinking of Bitcoin like
[26:13] how how important is it that important
[26:16] is open source development and uh coming
[26:18] from that world how did this influence
[26:21] your thinking of Bitcoin when you first
[26:23] discovered Bitcoin and yeah how was your
[26:25] story there yeah I started to study
[26:28] going not for um speculative reasons but
[26:32] I was interested in technology really
[26:36] for the my first two year I I was I was
[26:39] trying to break Bitcoin and after uh
[26:44] my un success I finally capitulated and
[26:49] started to buy some Bitcoin also was
[26:52] involved in experimenting with mining
[26:54] something like that we did a lot of
[26:56] stuff but I think open source is
[27:00] necessary for
[27:01] Bitcoin because we are uh we need the
[27:04] transparency we need um security so the
[27:08] open source model is not only enabling
[27:11] it's a a requirement a requirement
[27:14] because you otherwise you need to trust
[27:18] your software
[27:19] provider which is a step back in
[27:22] peer-to-peer
[27:23] I don't need to ask permission to use it
[27:27] so it's
[27:29] not not only a a secur a good security
[27:31] practice but it's a necessity for
[27:33] Bitcoin I'm I'm surely based because I I
[27:36] like uh ban I like open source because
[27:39] it's uh free access to know to knowledge
[27:43] I remember my young days when I first
[27:46] discovered that you can write in a
[27:49] terminal man man have your manual page
[27:52] of your manual page comment and was
[27:55] excited about that my first lead I I
[27:58] installed my first Linux in 19 on an
[28:01] Amiga 4000s it was really hard and it it
[28:06] took really long but um the the the
[28:12] graphical uh X Windows system on Amiga
[28:17] was faster with 200 colors than native
[28:21] Amiga operating system with 16 colors so
[28:25] I was yeah this is fast it's blazing
[28:29] fast this is is really early really cool
[28:32] cool days and it's uh open source
[28:34] development is so important in general
[28:36] like even outside of course for for
[28:37] Bitcoin it's essential like Bitcoin is
[28:39] not open source like it's then the
[28:41] there's no point to it uh but even for
[28:44] outside it's it's really important I
[28:46] think and I also saw I kind of like the
[28:48] definition of Andreas anop about
[28:51] Bitcoin in a in a in a good speech he
[28:55] was um talking about um uh the
[28:58] difference between uh software
[29:00] development and Hardware development and
[29:04] uh say that Bitcoin has some traits of
[29:07] both because in hardw development you
[29:09] need to plan a lot it cannot break
[29:12] things while you are um developing
[29:16] because you need to print on um
[29:19] silicon and otherwise software
[29:21] development and the open source software
[29:24] development in the startup internet area
[29:28] have like the Mantra move fast and Bre
[29:31] things that was also used by ethereum
[29:35] guys and you cannot do really that in
[29:38] Bitcoin you cannot move fast and break
[29:40] things you shouldn't break things you
[29:43] should move low and uh careful like
[29:47] Hardware development you should be more
[29:50] careful and is was calling not um
[29:54] software hardware and the Bitcoin uh
[29:57] thing it was uh he was calling it trust
[30:01] whereare which we have some
[30:03] characteristic of Open Source
[30:05] development and some careful attention
[30:07] and uh need to uh th before doing too
[30:12] much things ER from the hardw
[30:16] development I think TRW for Bitcoin like
[30:19] a new kind of Technology organism could
[30:22] be a fitting idea I told you a lot about
[30:25] 21 Bitcoin the best place for me to buy
[30:29] Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin only
[30:31] exchange but now let's talk about how to
[30:34] secure your Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin
[30:36] you don't want to leave them on Exchange
[30:38] you want to take self custody you want
[30:41] to take responsibility of your own
[30:44] Bitcoin that's why I recommend getting a
[30:47] bitbox bitbox is an amazing wallet where
[30:50] you can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[30:52] simple way very secure you can even
[30:55] create a passphrase if that pass phrase
[30:58] you can basically create a hidden wallet
[31:01] on the device itself make sure to buy
[31:05] your bitbox in the link down in the
[31:07] description and with code Robin you even
[31:09] get a 5% discount yeah really cool I I
[31:13] think so too that we have like we should
[31:16] not break too many things in Bitcoin and
[31:18] should not move too fast uh and you also
[31:20] talk I quickly saw your your website and
[31:23] you uh talked about the sin of Game
[31:26] Theory which was really interesting I
[31:27] think it was like on on the page where
[31:29] there's like a quote of of yours uh and
[31:33] from your services what you provide uh
[31:36] and what do you mean with like send of
[31:38] of of game the do you remember putting
[31:40] it on the
[31:41] website I don't remember what you you
[31:44] are referring to H I said the sign of
[31:48] Game Theory or the s s of game the S but
[31:53] it it's okay can you spell
[31:56] sen n remember what I was talking
[32:00] about s s
[32:03] Theory no no I completely forgot my CH
[32:08] thoughts related on Game Theory in many
[32:13] different areas if you are doing a
[32:17] retrospective on bitcoin you you could
[32:19] also attach some Game Theory really to
[32:22] the properties like Bitcoin is anti
[32:26] fragile which is I think it's um a
[32:30] retrospective view not a future view of
[32:33] Bitcoin so Bitcoin is not anti fragile
[32:37] to cool is not on the you I'm
[32:42] not discuss it but you uh have some
[32:47] peculiarities like different game theory
[32:50] mechanism inside bcoin we have a lot of
[32:53] in the mining area in the no in the in
[32:59] in the software uh choosing of the
[33:02] software you you are running the
[33:06] area there are a lot of also in a lot
[33:09] inan life in network too in different
[33:12] kind of way to open pish close the
[33:16] channels there is not one single aspect
[33:19] of again the involved inin there are
[33:21] multiple probably we we will
[33:24] see also in in the future other
[33:29] mechanism developing
[33:32] because nowadays you we are seeing uh
[33:35] Bitcoin in um in infiltrating in um
[33:41] getting you see like I I I'm talking
[33:43] about the the ETF of the biggest uh
[33:47] banking group of United States so it's
[33:50] percolating in the society like like
[33:53] that so it's uh it will be more
[33:56] different to remove I think it is
[33:59] impossible to remove Bitcoin from the
[34:01] human humankind since
[34:04] 2014
[34:05] but each each year pass is not just the
[34:09] low of just time passing and people
[34:13] realizing that um since uh Bitcoin is
[34:18] here from from 15 years maybe it will
[34:22] will keep living um for 15 years more
[34:26] but it's also different it's here to
[34:28] stay it's not um a doubt I have anymore
[34:32] since a lot of years Bitcoin is here to
[34:36] stay H the bad thing is that the the
[34:40] people who need Bitcoin most are uh
[34:44] probably the people who have um the most
[34:47] intellectual also difficulties to
[34:48] approach Bitcoin this is a thing that
[34:51] will will
[34:52] go bad and bad each year like the the
[34:56] the window of for the bank outside
[34:59] Bitcoin is is and of closed so we have a
[35:03] lot of um we like a Humanity we had an
[35:08] incredible window of opportunity it's
[35:11] still kind of open because not ER not
[35:15] all the the rich people not all the
[35:17] institution not all the central banks
[35:20] are still uh inal for Bitcoin so uh
[35:26] still people need Bitcoin can approach
[35:30] and have some advantage over the
[35:33] institution
[35:34] over process Bitcoin which I think is an
[35:38] incredible incredible thing in the
[35:40] history of humanity every other
[35:42] opportunity rich people or powerful
[35:46] people have um some Advantage advantage
[35:50] to gain access to new technology and new
[35:53] good things in that happens in
[35:55] humanity Force syic reasons we have some
[35:59] Advantage but the I think that the lucky
[36:04] window is slowly closing definitely and
[36:07] I think um which is also interesting
[36:10] that most people who needed the most as
[36:13] you said um they don't do it and uh
[36:16] which leads me to an interesting
[36:17] question for you uh who do you think uh
[36:20] will benefit the most like from uh like
[36:23] just an group standpoint like there are
[36:25] different groups of
[36:28] the N like our we are blessed by Bitcoin
[36:33] thank you Sosi for
[36:35] that we we we needed so we won thank
[36:40] think I
[36:42] it yes why this is the problem because
[36:46] uh people when they they cannot see the
[36:49] Revolutionary part of Bitcoin um
[36:54] environment because it's it's coming
[36:58] from an an unexpected way I try to
[37:01] oversimplify that if you are um like of
[37:06] leftist political view you probably
[37:08] think that the revolution of or change
[37:12] or good change come from a society when
[37:16] they um will learn enough they have
[37:20] learn enough book cultur spread over the
[37:23] masses and the masses will right if you
[37:26] are a kind of Rish you think that you
[37:31] need the illuminated King that will
[37:35] change for good H and fix all the
[37:38] problems if you are kind of mystical you
[37:41] think that um by adding enough trees and
[37:46] drinking enough grams of
[37:50] kurkuma H people will rise spirituality
[37:54] spirituality so you cannot uh recognize
[37:58] Bitcoin it comes from math it comes from
[38:01] uh code it comes from
[38:06] cryptography what is
[38:08] that I never heard the history when I
[38:11] was young about uh Magic come from from
[38:14] cryptography magic come from a random
[38:17] guy will uh value Faith over
[38:21] facts something Hood tisses like that so
[38:25] we are now evaluating that's over faith
[38:29] is it's a stange thing to to see also
[38:33] the the anarchist part is difficult for
[38:36] the anarchist we have here in betweenin
[38:39] val an historical Anarchist group that
[38:42] fail completely to recognize Bitcoin
[38:45] crypto anarchism it's different from
[38:48] anarchism we have we have no had to King
[38:52] said to be had we really need some
[38:55] technologies it's incredible cannot P
[38:58] it's impossible so it's impossible to
[39:01] recognize this will take time and I
[39:04] think Bitcoin will be obvious but uh
[39:07] it's a b to recognize Bitcoin before it
[39:11] will be obvious for any anyone but it
[39:14] will be obvious not for strange property
[39:17] because it's a tep portable gold easily
[39:20] forget H this I think it's a a bad thing
[39:26] it's um
[39:28] it's a shame that who will benefit most
[39:32] or who will need most not not only in
[39:35] our
[39:37] Bridge Italy but also in the other parts
[39:40] of the world they didn't recognize
[39:42] Bitcoin are as they their savior I kind
[39:46] joking but not so much I think Bitcoin
[39:49] could save many many lives surely save
[39:53] the mind not only for financial point of
[39:56] view I was looking for a technology but
[40:00] when I become involved in Bitcoin I had
[40:02] some years uh missing
[40:05] my
[40:07] semestral lar
[40:09] stage when I first uh studied Linux or
[40:14] some C programming I passed through
[40:18] different lar stage when you study a
[40:20] techology and you are getting really
[40:23] excited and passionate about it and it
[40:26] was not experimenting um this kind of
[40:29] feeling since a lot of years before
[40:31] encountering Bitcoin and Bitcoin it's uh
[40:35] it's it's really cool because it's an
[40:37] interesting technology for me I I say
[40:41] but it's also like a Kind of Revolution
[40:44] for the society in the whole but also
[40:48] for uh the Revolutionary which see this
[40:51] is also another new completely new thing
[40:54] in most of the past Revolution being a
[40:57] revolutionary is not a a very good idea
[41:01] because you are losing money you are
[41:03] losing heha you
[41:05] losing also freedom to participate in a
[41:08] revolution this time you participate in
[41:12] a revolution and um while the revolution
[41:15] develops you you are gaining you're
[41:18] gaining um
[41:20] freedom freedom uh as soon as you
[41:23] started understanding Bitcoin and um if
[41:27] you wait a while do not spend too much
[41:30] Bitcoin in
[41:31] beers like some of my developers did uh
[41:35] you will probably have also a nice
[41:38] future so it's it's very it's really a
[41:42] incredible thing be involved in the
[41:45] Revolutionary part of Bitcoin so start
[41:47] yourself a Bitcoin Valley it's really
[41:49] fun rewarding you make a lot of friends
[41:52] that's a I love that view I never heard
[41:53] that before that we are in the first
[41:55] Revolution where you actually gain money
[41:58] where you actually gain the freedom and
[42:01] it's like that peaceful Revolution when
[42:03] you participate you actually benefit no
[42:05] violence at all just game for all yeah I
[42:10] mean I think for some people that enter
[42:12] the space the volatility uh is is not as
[42:15] easy to handle I I've seen that with
[42:17] friends but you can overcome that easily
[42:20] when you just like have
[42:22] waiting you wait if you wait a bit your
[42:26] volatility problem disappearance yeah
[42:28] definitely you have to have at least one
[42:30] cycle and then you're probably really
[42:33] good off by the way we like just ended
[42:36] one cycle like one two weeks ago we had
[42:39] the Haring I think when this comes out
[42:40] it will be probably like uh two weeks uh
[42:43] ago uh so we had like officially now the
[42:47] fourth EPO of of Bitcoin ended and now
[42:50] we are in the the fifth the fifth yeah
[42:53] and now we are rarer than gold rarer
[42:56] than gold yeah definitely it's really
[42:58] cool to to be that but we we we new that
[43:01] we have new it's really cool to be us
[43:03] it's really cool and fun to be us yeah I
[43:06] agree what I wanted to ask is um you
[43:09] wrote a tweet uh about about that about
[43:12] the Haring where you uh wrote that
[43:15] before uh this forth Theo was all about
[43:18] the digital gold uh narrative uh
[43:21] something like that and now it's about
[43:23] the Jason lry uh thesis of softw I think
[43:27] I think you wrote something about that
[43:29] okay okay software yes this is a book
[43:31] about it's not really known and I read
[43:35] just one third of the book I need to
[43:37] finish it but I found it interesting it
[43:40] it should be a book by a major of the
[43:44] United States force which should be also
[43:46] a researcher for MIT this book is kind
[43:48] of memo internal memo for the first
[43:52] force of United States it's really
[43:54] interesting because a soft War means not
[43:57] software but means a war that is not
[44:00] hard so is not um f with K kinetics or
[44:06] kinetics weapons but with asteroid
[44:10] weapons which we know that are less
[44:14] lethal than
[44:16] kinetic if you're not throwing miners at
[44:19] people otherwise a miner could be some
[44:23] couple of kilograms and also hard hard
[44:27] but I think a is more lethal than a
[44:32] minor it's it's really interesting I I I
[44:36] don't think I'm really qualified to talk
[44:38] about this book because I I didn't read
[44:40] the the whole book so
[44:42] maybe if I don't see you I I I saw
[44:46] strange things but it it's it's it's
[44:49] really interesting we kind of rewrite
[44:53] the the idea of the wars in with a game
[44:56] theory approach from the starting point
[44:58] of life evolving on Earth so if you want
[45:02] to see uh how you can relate a minor
[45:07] with um
[45:10] protoo cell you you should read this
[45:13] book at least the the first onethird of
[45:16] the book as I did I need to finish it
[45:19] yeah it's it's really cool it's also
[45:20] about the the idea of the Haring because
[45:23] you wrote about that also like uh and we
[45:26] have this EPO
[45:27] now like we have all four years right
[45:30] around that time we have new EPO it's
[45:32] like New Year's Eve but on stereoids H
[45:35] for me at least what what do you expect
[45:37] from what do you expect from Bitcoin in
[45:39] like the next four years what's the next
[45:42] cycle all about what do you expect from
[45:43] it I think that Hal in cycle will the
[45:48] couple from
[45:50] Bitcoin popularity Cycles I think
[45:53] Bitcoin will still uh pricewise
[45:58] go on like a bubble
[46:01] and
[46:03] and kind so because is it's working like
[46:06] that for from a I think um population
[46:11] kind of youel what I mean in the first
[46:14] times of Bitcoin Bitcoin um attracted a
[46:17] kind of computer science researchers
[46:20] that were were interesting in a
[46:21] decentralized currency and after a while
[46:26] some from um Austrian Economist
[46:31] Fanboys and and when you had the first
[46:35] uh BB balls it's kind of an another um
[46:42] part of uh the world population
[46:45] known on about Bitcoin they started to
[46:48] get interested in it and some small
[46:53] whale noticed that Bitcoin is rising
[46:56] price
[46:57] from and um some
[47:00] months other people get interested
[47:03] because of that then you have the bball
[47:06] that
[47:07] bust you have some uh more time passing
[47:11] another group of people start getting
[47:14] Bitcoin getting interesting Bitcoin and
[47:18] we have the Dem demography of Bitcoin
[47:21] that changes each
[47:23] bubbles because it's it's um it's not um
[47:28] I think it's not created by the housing
[47:31] effect theing effect have have just uh
[47:35] kind of media effect until now and
[47:39] future Hing will have less effect
[47:42] because they will have less effect in in
[47:46] proper term of um scarcity of Bitcoin
[47:50] now we Sur pass gold next steps are
[47:53] realizing that Bitcoin is not infecting
[47:56] any more so each future aling will have
[48:00] I think less impact
[48:02] on both the price and also The Narrative
[48:06] of Bitcoin what we will see we will see
[48:09] more uh financial institution getting in
[48:12] their hands on
[48:14] bitcoin the the first small central
[48:18] banks uh and then the first medium
[48:21] Central
[48:22] Bank and I have the secret plan of U
[48:26] making the Italy being the first of the
[48:28] eight country of the G8 in involving
[48:33] Bitcoin this is my secret dream for my
[48:38] conspiracy that I want to not kind kind
[48:40] of joking but not so much I I I would
[48:43] like but I'm I'm not so confident in the
[48:46] smartness of uh Italian politicians to
[48:50] we probably will be a follower of uh the
[48:55] first G8 count we are set is going which
[48:58] could happen like 12
[49:01] years it will probably surprise me if it
[49:05] will happen before but it could it could
[49:07] could let's see how the next currency
[49:11] Wars what will happen we have the bricks
[49:15] um we have the dollar and that inflation
[49:18] of the dollar pushed with um army let's
[49:21] see what happens Bitcoin we probably not
[49:25] care so much
[49:27] I think yeah definitely not and I think
[49:29] in the in the G8 countries uh there's
[49:33] like Canada America Germany like there
[49:35] are big big big countries in there I
[49:38] think they will all need a long time to
[49:41] long time yeah it's a long plan so may
[49:45] may maybe uh if you can uh start
[49:48] something big or like with join forces
[49:51] with other Italians uh maybe it's
[49:53] possible I don't know but no no no I was
[49:56] complet
[49:57] dreaming without believing in my dream
[50:02] too much but that that's where beautiful
[50:04] things happen right when when you dream
[50:06] and you think big and then maybe it's
[50:08] happening like I think Italy would be a
[50:10] great place for for for
[50:12] bitcoiners Bitcoin Valley is Sur a great
[50:15] pace for four Bitcoin come uh to visit
[50:18] us and enjoy your staying and uh spend
[50:22] your Bitcoin here with a lot of discount
[50:26] really really cool perfect uh before we
[50:28] get to our end routine of the podcast uh
[50:31] I'm always like really passionate about
[50:33] bitcoiners because they have really
[50:35] interesting things uh to think about and
[50:37] to to learn about uh besides Bitcoin
[50:40] what are you currently studying what are
[50:42] you currently passionate about what are
[50:43] you spending your time on when you don't
[50:46] uh spend your time on
[50:47] bitcoin okay I'm I want to be finger
[50:51] style
[50:52] player so I
[50:54] enjoy finger finger picking I just
[50:57] bought one of the first smart guitar uh
[51:01] which is a fiber guitar with smartphone
[51:05] in it which have a social network of
[51:08] guitarist and you can play on record
[51:10] your guitar directly I'm interested in
[51:14] astronomy I read some paper some
[51:17] interested kind of an nothing
[51:23] nothing and uh I play some some video
[51:28] games with not not too much I think I'm
[51:31] a Serial uh video game player so when I
[51:35] start a game I play just this game for a
[51:39] a long period Then I stop start another
[51:42] one I'm a world gamer also but I'm I'm
[51:47] really those month focused on on B
[51:51] Valley so I my hobbies are I need to to
[51:56] spend more time I think playing
[52:00] practicing the the the one instruments I
[52:04] think it's uh I think that every music
[52:06] player will say that he he will he's not
[52:10] practicing too much or to
[52:14] enough and you and you what what are
[52:17] your hobbi other than Bitcoin that's
[52:21] that's an interesting question I don't
[52:22] know uh I have my whole life now quite
[52:26] around Bitcoin because I'm doing the
[52:27] podcast full time uh I mean uh other
[52:31] passionate project that I have is the
[52:33] podcast which is content wise about
[52:37] Bitcoin but there's a lot of strategy
[52:39] involved there's a lot of techniques
[52:40] involved where I have to just get better
[52:42] in podcasting itself we have to get
[52:44] better in organizing everything I also
[52:47] started my company now like one and a
[52:49] half months ago so I have to get the
[52:52] whole bookkeeping and having a a company
[52:55] like there are so many different things
[52:57] I'm now having to learn uh so my only
[53:00] source to to learn about Bitcoin right
[53:02] now uh is my guests that I interview
[53:05] every day uh and Twitter that's the the
[53:09] main source where I get new Bitcoin
[53:11] information it's good that I already
[53:13] have four years of Bitcoin education in
[53:15] my in my head but right now I'm really
[53:17] looking into like how to uh successfully
[53:19] launch the company how to get the
[53:21] podcast to be sustainable so I can do it
[53:24] actually fulltime and have some
[53:26] employees helping me uh and this is
[53:29] where I I'm right now really investing
[53:32] my time outside of of Bitcoin yes
[53:34] another thing that I do sometimes I I'm
[53:37] helping some random uh open source video
[53:41] games when I have like a lot of time
[53:45] free time I like to help uh some open
[53:49] source game like looking at the the bug
[53:53] um bug tracker and looking for or some
[53:57] simple issue I can fix I think it it's
[54:00] uh funny really really cool I love it I
[54:04] love it and now we're coming to the
[54:06] another thing that I fail to mention in
[54:09] RTO we have I think the the only um
[54:14] physical source of Street Bitcoin no kyc
[54:19] for free what you mean if you come and
[54:23] walk by in the center of in the town of
[54:26] the center you you can find our shop and
[54:29] even if you we are closed we have a
[54:31] window and we um free gift of Bitcoin
[54:35] some like z z some
[54:39] satosi for each one for everyone will
[54:43] can um install a lighting Network and uh
[54:47] scan a QR code so if um in Italy any you
[54:53] cannot say it's difficult to get Bitcoin
[54:55] because we are giving them for free on
[54:58] the street for each block that
[55:02] passes see it seems strange why you are
[55:04] you are really uh giving Bitcoin for
[55:07] free to people yes we started like a
[55:10] proom a Christmas promotion two years
[55:13] ago and then we saw that the people were
[55:17] not abusing from uh from it and then we
[55:20] we kept the window open so if you come
[55:23] by to R to you can get some free Bitcoin
[55:26] in the street from the street really
[55:29] cool if if you pass four or five blocks
[55:31] you have enough money to buy a coffee
[55:34] for example just wait five blocks now I
[55:37] have to come and get a coffee from verto
[55:40] really cool come um we having an end
[55:43] routine in the podcast where the
[55:44] previous guest is asking a question for
[55:46] the next guest without knowing who the
[55:48] next guest is and your question from the
[55:50] previous guest is how do you think
[55:53] Bitcoin will help Humanity actually
[55:56] already answered the question because it
[55:58] will help Humanity in different ways for
[56:03] people becoming involved in Bitcoin will
[56:06] teach you a lot of different lesson in
[56:09] some areas that you never done off like
[56:13] if you start culture culture cult impact
[56:18] from Bitcoin in the cyer punk cyber Punk
[56:22] area so you will learn about uh uh
[56:26] peer-to-peer the importance of privacy
[56:29] the battle from uh simman and pgp so a
[56:34] lot of culture improvements you will get
[56:37] as we told before you will get some um
[56:40] instant Financial Freedom and some
[56:44] future poverty proof something like
[56:48] that
[56:50] and we will see if uh we will have also
[56:54] other benefits like reducing the
[56:57] corruption for using technology like
[57:02] M which is really needed by our Humanity
[57:06] needs to exchange information and sing
[57:10] so the whole economy and this is the
[57:13] main foreseeable foreseeable future what
[57:16] are my hope that will really spring
[57:21] revolution in also in other
[57:24] areas I really enjoy the original vision
[57:27] of um crypto arism like reducing the
[57:32] government function which we have a
[57:35] better technology uh to implement this
[57:38] Vis like for the M but also for other
[57:42] things that um are nowadays used or uh
[57:47] served by herey government system of
[57:52] pamal forms and instead we we could use
[57:56] some time chain derived technology which
[58:00] is
[58:02] not cannot be
[58:04] corrupt so the main idea of without
[58:07] being a maximalist of in this field like
[58:11] Bitcoin will uh kill all all the
[58:14] hierarchy function of a a voted group
[58:18] and not going so far but most of the
[58:21] functions uh now now Us by go government
[58:26] uh because we had no other uh ways of
[58:30] realizing that particular
[58:33] function I hope that will be uh
[58:36] implemented by some uh crypto Anarchy
[58:40] friendly ideas or
[58:43] technology this is my answer my question
[58:48] for the next uh the next guest
[58:52] um what we could be do you think it's
[58:56] going to ask a question for a invisible
[58:58] guest I'm so optimist about Bitcoin and
[59:02] not so tricky I I could have some
[59:04] technical question but I I don't know if
[59:06] it will be interesting like how many
[59:09] just let's do that that that thing how
[59:11] many years you think that Technologies
[59:15] like thic multipath payments will
[59:19] need to be implemented in Li Network so
[59:23] a technical question not a political or
[59:26] open a close the question oh really
[59:29] really cool because it's needed is
[59:30] needed to e also also L2 or something
[59:35] like L2 will be needed for is the the
[59:38] work of both the lightning wallet
[59:41] developers and also to ease the
[59:44] maintenance from from uh lighting
[59:47] Network users really cool okay let's
[59:50] let's I think that's perfect thank thank
[59:53] you for for giving me the the question
[59:54] for the next guest already

[59:59] you on it was really pleasure to talk
