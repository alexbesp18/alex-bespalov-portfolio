[00:00] inflation is a huge problem I think
[00:01] inflation causes the most suffering in
[00:03] the world what's going to cause the most
[00:04] adoption is pain people actually feeling
[00:06] a problem it's some crazy percentage of
[00:08] Americans that are going month to month
[00:10] it's like 70% if they have health
[00:13] emergency they cannot afford it they
[00:14] don't have more than 400 bucks inflation
[00:16] is the increase of monetary units it is
[00:19] printing money a world with no inflation
[00:21] means a world where there is no money
[00:23] printing if I go to the store and milk a
[00:26] dollar today and it's a dollar tomorrow
[00:28] and it's a dollar next year and I can
[00:30] count on that that's amazing Bitcoin is
[00:32] not actually wealth it's just a symbol
[00:35] of wealth food is wealth The Goods the
[00:38] services the things that you need to
[00:39] live that's really wealth would you
[00:41] rather get paid more dollars every year
[00:44] but the dollars buy you less food and
[00:46] housing and energy or would you rather
[00:48] get paid less dollars every year but
[00:51] with those dollars you get more food
[00:53] more energy more houses I think the
[00:55] things that people actually need and
[00:57] that actually provide you health are
[00:59] going to be extremely expensive we're
[01:01] going to have much higher quality things
[01:03] that we actually need houses will be
[01:05] better food will be better energy will
[01:07] be better a rich man's wealth is in his
[01:09] City now it's in the services and the
[01:11] goods that you get it's the chef that
[01:13] grills that stake for you if you
[01:14] actually want better things you should
[01:16] want your neighbor to be happier and
[01:19] [Music]
[01:23] healthier you have an interesting film
[01:26] no more
[01:27] inflation um what is it about and and
[01:30] what's the goal is is of of the movie
[01:32] there yeah so the goal of the movie is
[01:35] to you know reach the average person you
[01:38] know with um a concise orange pill you
[01:40] know I feel like um there's so many
[01:43] great tools with for Bitcoin wallets and
[01:45] things have become much easier I think
[01:46] the biggest hurdle we have is really
[01:48] just education you know um getting
[01:50] through to people and having them
[01:52] understand what Bitcoin is and what
[01:54] problems it solves so um the film
[01:56] approaches Bitcoin from the inflation
[01:58] standpoint um which I think is you know
[02:01] probably the most universal problem in
[02:02] the world and so the film covers you
[02:05] know what inflation looks like around
[02:06] the world in different intensities of
[02:09] inflation and why it's happening you
[02:11] know money Printing and where that money
[02:13] printing is being spent and what effect
[02:16] it's having on the world um and that you
[02:18] know this basically has happened to
[02:20] every money in human history just
[02:22] inflated you know spent on whatever the
[02:24] government wants to do until everybody's
[02:26] like you know poor and desperate um and
[02:28] from there you know the film Segways
[02:30] into Bitcoin you know a money that can't
[02:32] be printed and um why that is and it
[02:35] also covers you know some of the common
[02:37] objections and things that people have
[02:38] heard about Bitcoin you know it's it's
[02:40] too difficult to use it's the energy is
[02:42] bad for the Earth it's only used by
[02:44] criminals and uh yeah so that's really
[02:46] what the film covers it's it's a film
[02:48] about inflation so it really details the
[02:50] problem of inflation told through you
[02:52] know stories around the world and then
[02:54] of course it leads into you know the
[02:56] solution which is Bitcoin interesting
[02:59] and you think that the the education is
[03:01] the biggest hurdle uh for main M mream
[03:06] mainstream adoption yeah I think so I
[03:09] mean I'm sure there's programmers you
[03:12] know I'm not a programmer but uh that
[03:13] that would say you know we need maybe to
[03:15] to update some things with Bitcoin
[03:17] before it's ready for like true Mass
[03:19] adoption like what if a billion people
[03:20] tomorrow wanted Bitcoin like H how would
[03:23] we handle that right so I don't pretend
[03:25] to know uh the solution there but my
[03:27] point is that uh you know Bitcoin is
[03:30] already ready for more people I mean
[03:32] look at the the uh the fees on the
[03:34] blockchain right like it's not very high
[03:36] um and so we can fit more people and the
[03:39] tools are easy enough to use it's just
[03:41] someone needs to be interested enough to
[03:43] actually do it like in my opinion even
[03:45] setting up your own lightning node is
[03:47] actually doable if you have a need to do
[03:50] it like if you're like I need to do this
[03:52] to to get groceries I think lots and
[03:54] lots of people could do it um and so I
[03:57] think the Gap there is simply an
[04:00] education Gap um some people you know
[04:03] maybe no matter how much you educate
[04:05] them no matter what you do you produce
[04:06] the best book or film or video game
[04:09] whatever is like the most interactive
[04:11] way to do it you know they just will
[04:13] resist Bitcoin so some people maybe are
[04:16] unreachable currently but I think
[04:18] there's a lot of people out there that
[04:20] are open-minded enough to actually
[04:22] consider it and um if we can actually
[04:24] get through to them the more people we
[04:26] can get interested in Bitcoin the more
[04:28] Minds we have thinking about about
[04:30] scaling Solutions thinking about you
[04:32] know um Mining and Asic manufacturing
[04:35] and I think a lot of other problems that
[04:37] maybe you know more knowledgeable people
[04:39] are worried about for the long-term
[04:40] Bitcoin I think that education brings in
[04:43] more Minds to help solve these problems
[04:45] that we're figuring out so yeah I think
[04:48] education is the biggest hurdle um you
[04:51] know for like Mass Bitcoin adoption it's
[04:55] interesting for me
[04:57] um when you think about
[05:00] uh everyone having to understand do do
[05:03] you think that everyone has to
[05:06] understand Bitcoin for in order for
[05:08] Bitcoin to be
[05:11] adopted I think it depends on who you
[05:13] are if you're somebody who is you know H
[05:16] has wealth and you're trying to save it
[05:18] for the future then I think yes you you
[05:20] do need to at least to some degree
[05:22] understand it better to have the
[05:24] conviction to not sell it when the price
[05:26] goes down you know or also have the
[05:28] conviction to not sell it when the price
[05:29] goes up right it's like a double-edged
[05:31] sword and so I think um it to to use
[05:35] Bitcoin as a savings technology yes
[05:38] absolutely because you need that
[05:39] conviction but to use it to you know
[05:42] flee your country or to receive
[05:45] remittance payments um you know that's
[05:48] ready right now like you know people can
[05:50] just uh use that right now they don't
[05:52] need to know how it works you know like
[05:54] in my film I interviewed somebody from
[05:56] El Salvador and he used to have to go to
[05:59] the bank you know his dad would send him
[06:00] a code he would go to the bank he'd wait
[06:02] in line he could only go on Saturdays
[06:04] because he works Monday through Friday
[06:06] and you know he goes there an hour
[06:07] before the bank opens there's already 30
[06:09] people in line and sometimes you don't
[06:11] get to the teller in time before they
[06:13] close and sometimes you do and sometimes
[06:15] they just don't have any cash left and
[06:16] so he has to wait a whole another week
[06:18] to try to go get it again and then if
[06:19] it's not there that time he's got to
[06:21] drive an hour away to a city to get it
[06:23] all while paying like 15 bucks you know
[06:26] um which is like a day's worth of work
[06:28] in El Salvador right so it's it's crazy
[06:30] and now he just his dad just sends him
[06:32] you know Bitcoin over lightning he pays
[06:34] like a 3 Cent fee and it's available to
[06:37] him right away so he can go change that
[06:40] into cash if he wants you know like he
[06:42] doesn't have to hang on to the Bitcoin
[06:43] and you know experience the volatility
[06:45] so anyway in short people who are using
[06:48] it as a savings technology absolutely at
[06:50] least need to have a better
[06:52] understanding you know to cover the
[06:54] common fud like oh this quantum computer
[06:56] fud recently right like if you don't
[06:58] really understand Bitcoin very well that
[07:00] might scare you you might sell it right
[07:01] now you know and so yeah some people
[07:04] need the education to start using it and
[07:06] other people can just start using it but
[07:07] again they need to know that hey I can I
[07:10] can use it for remittance right I can
[07:12] use it for um for these other things
[07:14] that aren't just saving so again there's
[07:16] an education Gap there too
[07:18] right yeah it's super interesting i l
[07:21] that topic because uh when we look at
[07:24] internet adoption um and we look at what
[07:28] happened with
[07:30] um for example most people have no clue
[07:34] what the tcpip protocol is but still use
[07:36] it every day um the same like if you're
[07:40] sending a WhatsApp message you see the
[07:43] two ticks you can log in your in your
[07:45] WhatsApp client uh you can send a
[07:48] message uh and you see when someone
[07:50] received it and they turn like blue when
[07:53] someone read it if they put the right
[07:55] settings and stuff like that um they
[07:58] understand that
[08:00] but they couldn't understand how it
[08:02] works but they still trust that the
[08:04] other person got the message and even if
[08:07] the other person says no I didn't got
[08:08] message they trust WhatsApp more they
[08:11] they trust like oh you have the two TT
[08:13] like I see it that you got it they don't
[08:16] know what's happening under the under
[08:18] the hood they didn't see the packages
[08:20] actually moving on the network they
[08:22] didn't see any proof of that but they
[08:24] have so much trust in that plue tick of
[08:27] WhatsApp that they like of course you
[08:29] got it like you're lying to me of course
[08:31] you got it so that's super interesting
[08:33] for me when we now get that to bitcoin
[08:36] where right now people are like oh but
[08:38] how can it work and and what what's the
[08:41] like does it really scale and stuff like
[08:43] that but I I feel like we're getting to
[08:45] a point that's uh in in in the Bitcoin
[08:48] history where we don't have to explain
[08:50] anymore that Bitcoin is working because
[08:52] it's obviously working it obviously
[08:55] transacts money and you just like can
[08:57] instantly do that and you can very ver
[08:59] ify that but most people will never
[09:01] verify because they just have to trust
[09:04] you can also verify that a message got
[09:06] sent from your local um uh wifi to the
[09:11] other person you can uh you can track
[09:14] that message that package over the
[09:16] internet to a certain extent uh so but
[09:19] nobody does that uh so that that that's
[09:22] where kind of wanted to go with the
[09:24] question of like H how much do we have
[09:27] to explain Bitcoin to people people uh
[09:30] and and to what degree and at what point
[09:34] maybe
[09:35] um won't we have to explain anymore
[09:38] because it's such an obvious choice to
[09:41] have it as
[09:43] money yeah it's hard to say because um
[09:46] again if it's somebody who's saving even
[09:47] if they see it's working now and it's
[09:49] $100,000 right they might always still
[09:52] think like well if the government wants
[09:53] to shut it down then they can shut it
[09:56] down right uh like okay yeah Trump is
[09:58] friendly with Bitcoin right now but what
[10:01] if the next president isn't right so
[10:03] then it'll get shut down so maybe it's
[10:05] only safe for the next four years right
[10:07] so that person needs to understand
[10:10] enough to understand that the government
[10:13] can't really do anything about it right
[10:15] so whatever that entails they need to go
[10:18] through that process for themselves and
[10:20] to be able to honestly tell themselves
[10:23] like I can't see a way the government
[10:25] can actually shut this down and every
[10:27] other attempt that's been done by every
[10:29] other country including China which is
[10:31] maybe the most sophisticated when it
[10:32] comes to blocking and banning um you
[10:35] know they try to ban the mining and that
[10:37] didn't really work out very well for
[10:38] them so they need all that information
[10:40] on the other hand though right if I go
[10:42] to El Salvador and I meet somebody at in
[10:44] the line at the bank and I'm like hey
[10:46] man you know like um let me show you I
[10:49] can send you $100 right now download
[10:51] this app I'm gonna send you $100 okay
[10:53] now we're going to walk over to the
[10:54] Bitcoin Center over here in Berlin you
[10:56] know in Berlin El Salvador there's a
[10:58] nice Bitcoin Center there people
[11:00] educating people where you can go and
[11:02] you can go and get cash right now from
[11:04] somebody just right there in that center
[11:06] right they don't need to know anything
[11:08] else just like if your family in the US
[11:11] can get this app and can get Bitcoin
[11:14] they can send it to you just like I sent
[11:16] it to you and then if you need the cash
[11:17] just go get the cash from these people
[11:19] right over here you don't have to wait
[11:21] in line anymore you're going to save you
[11:23] know
[11:25] $14.97 and um and it's much easier they
[11:29] don't need to know in my opinion that
[11:31] the government can't shut it down at any
[11:32] time because it doesn't matter for them
[11:34] they're literally getting in and out of
[11:35] Bitcoin like that but it's still
[11:37] benefiting them massively you know and
[11:39] so I think different people need
[11:41] different levels of education but I
[11:43] agree with you like look at cars right
[11:45] we all I mean in the US at least like
[11:47] everybody has a car right but I don't
[11:49] know how the how the thing works exactly
[11:51] I know it's got an engine and everything
[11:53] but yeah to a certain point we won't
[11:55] have to explain it anymore you know I
[11:57] don't know how many years or what the
[11:58] price will have to be before the average
[12:00] person is like yeah I I'm not worried
[12:02] about the government shutting it down
[12:04] anymore you know I don't know when we
[12:05] cross that point um but um it seems like
[12:10] it's it's trending in that direction so
[12:11] it's just a matter of time huh
[12:13] absolutely yeah it's it's I think there
[12:15] will be a point where we just uh talk
[12:18] about Bitcoin as something that just is
[12:22] there and there are people right now
[12:25] that say the internet is still just a f
[12:28] i personally met a person like that um
[12:32] even like it's not in my family but it's
[12:35] like far far out family in a different
[12:38] country uh and I met him and I sat down
[12:41] with him and he's like oh like because
[12:43] back then I worked for an IT security
[12:45] company and he basically was like okay
[12:49] like that thing has no future because
[12:51] the internet will be gone soon uh so uh
[12:55] that was a really interesting
[12:57] conversation by the way because there
[12:58] are really saw the same arguments
[13:02] against the internet that now come
[13:03] against Bitcoin like really like the
[13:06] almost line by
[13:08] line and then I looked uh even a little
[13:11] bit back and researched and so like oh
[13:13] like the the early internet critics the
[13:16] people that were against Internet it's
[13:19] very similar to how people are now
[13:21] against Bitcoin from from from that
[13:24] standpoint and I think the early
[13:25] internet also wanted to even reach some
[13:29] uh the same goals as as as as Bitcoin
[13:32] does not obviously not with money um
[13:35] even though there was some talks with
[13:37] that also but it wanted to provide some
[13:40] some PE peer-to-peer connection that was
[13:42] the original thought at least how I see
[13:44] it of of bitco of of the internet and it
[13:47] kind of involved in that uh weird
[13:50] centralized thing where everyone is on
[13:52] like five big companies all the time uh
[13:55] but it's it it was really interesting
[13:57] conversation to to have with someone
[14:00] that things in the internet is fought in
[14:05] 2023 I had that conversation with him uh
[14:08] and he probably still believes that in
[14:10] 2024 um and it opened my eyes to
[14:13] like not everyone will uh like Bitcoin
[14:18] not everyone will understand Bitcoin but
[14:21] even the biggest critics will have to
[14:24] use it like he has to use the internet
[14:27] still even though he says it will
[14:29] disappear and he doesn't like it but he
[14:31] still uses it and the same thing I think
[14:33] happens with with Bitcoin it's
[14:35] impossible to say when the point comes
[14:37] but there will be a point where like
[14:39] like the the point where there's no more
[14:42] Bitcoin podcast is the point where
[14:45] Bitcoin is so boring and normal where
[14:47] everyone accepts it because then nobody
[14:51] has to make a Bitcoin podcast I said
[14:52] that on stage actually in Abu Dhabi was
[14:55] sorry for going so long uh but but in
[14:58] Abu Dhabi uh as as someone asked me on
[15:01] stage actually said like oh like how do
[15:03] you um go ahead and and manage to Bare
[15:07] markets and the bull markets and Bitcoin
[15:09] is a content creator I was like I love
[15:11] them with without the bare markets
[15:14] without the
[15:15] volatility I wouldn't be here and
[15:17] talking about Bitcoin because if Bitcoin
[15:19] would just go up in a straight line it
[15:21] would be so obvious that everyone rot
[15:23] Rush In And then nobody has to explain
[15:25] it so so I kind of like like it that
[15:29] that's my purpose right now on Earth to
[15:31] explain it to people and and and get
[15:33] people on the podcast so sorry going on
[15:36] so it makes sense I mean we are living
[15:39] in a very unique time in history right
[15:41] maybe the most unique the most
[15:42] revolutionary and and also you and I are
[15:45] both young too right I mean some people
[15:46] are living through this history and
[15:48] they're already done working they're
[15:49] retired right um and I can see them
[15:51] wanting the number to go up because a
[15:53] lot of people like that are on fixed
[15:55] incomes right and so like maybe some of
[15:57] them are literally dipping into their
[15:59] Bitcoin stack every month to kind of to
[16:01] get by and so they don't have any more
[16:03] working years left right they they just
[16:05] want the number to go up but for us you
[16:07] know we're in a great opportunity you
[16:09] know we Bitcoin is obviously most people
[16:12] don't know about it so it's in it's you
[16:14] know a discovery phase for price and so
[16:17] you and I have the opportunity and the
[16:20] the the actual privilege to educate
[16:23] people and to talk about it right now
[16:24] like you're saying before it really
[16:26] becomes Universal where it's just like
[16:28] yeah bitcoin's just money you know like
[16:30] you don't talk about you know uh Money
[16:33] podcasts anymore because it solved so
[16:35] many of those problems you don't need to
[16:37] worry about what am I going to invest in
[16:38] what's the best place to put my money
[16:40] it's just like there and then we can
[16:41] focus on other things so no I think it's
[16:44] um I think you're right like we can't be
[16:46] who we are without everyone else being
[16:48] the way they are too so I'm trying to
[16:50] Enlighten people right and get as many
[16:52] normal people to understand Bitcoin but
[16:54] at the same time you know I am who I am
[16:57] I like I'm able to make this movie
[16:58] because no one's done it before because
[17:00] you know we're early we're we're that
[17:02] all those people exist so yeah it's it's
[17:05] a really it's a really great time to be
[17:07] alive and um man it's just getting
[17:10] easier with Bitcoin I think you know
[17:11] people are more more open to it and so
[17:14] yeah we'll see see how it goes how long
[17:16] before there's no more Bitcoin podcasts
[17:19] we'll see absolutely I think it will
[17:22] there will be a point like I think over
[17:24] the next like five years probably there
[17:26] will be an explosion of uh it's not just
[17:29] uh limited to podcast like content
[17:31] creators Educators Movie Makers like
[17:35] whatever however you can produce a piece
[17:37] of video uh in whatever different ways
[17:41] uh that will be a massive influx of that
[17:43] and at some point it will go into
[17:46] different directions they're still
[17:48] internet influencers they now just
[17:51] focusing on Apple products or they're
[17:54] focusing on movie reviews they are
[17:56] focusing on whatever like they're just
[17:58] like going in different directions and
[18:00] not on the main base layer right now
[18:03] we're just talking about Bitcoin the
[18:04] main base layer maybe in 10 years we're
[18:07] talking about one channel is talking
[18:09] about like one small thing on top of
[18:11] Bitcoin I don't know maybe we don't talk
[18:13] about Bitcoin at all because it's just
[18:15] like dcpip protocol and we don't care
[18:18] like it's just like air and it rhymed
[18:20] actually uh but yeah that's that that's
[18:23] kind of the way I see it um what role do
[18:26] you think um does the uxx of all the
[18:30] Bitcoin apps uh play the user experience
[18:34] of of the interface to to
[18:37] bitcoin I think um they're
[18:40] helpful um but not necessary again I
[18:44] think like um the tools and the
[18:46] interfaces we have now may not be
[18:48] perfect and they can probably be better
[18:50] but they're good enough you know if your
[18:53] situation is that serious right like if
[18:55] you're fleeing your country man the
[18:57] tools are good enough for you to get a
[19:00] wallet get your words you know memorize
[19:02] them go across the border you know put
[19:04] it back in like that works right and so
[19:08] um yeah I think they kind of like weave
[19:11] into each other the better the ux gets
[19:14] the more people will come in sooner you
[19:17] know um and then um the faster adoption
[19:20] will happen but at the same time I think
[19:23] probably what's going to cause the most
[19:24] adoption is pain like people actually
[19:26] feeling a problem and people like in the
[19:29] West for example um don't realize that
[19:32] they do have a huge problem which is
[19:33] inflation I mean you know if they just
[19:35] actually think about it for one second
[19:37] it's some crazy percentage of Americans
[19:39] that um and probably around the world
[19:41] too um like are going month to month
[19:45] it's like 70% right like they literally
[19:47] if they have like a health uh emergency
[19:50] they cannot afford it like they don't
[19:52] have more than 400 bucks or something
[19:53] like that and so for those people if the
[19:58] price of things keep going up how how
[20:00] are you going to live like how are you
[20:03] actually going to get by like what is
[20:04] going to happen you know and I I don't
[20:07] think people are really thinking about
[20:08] that because if they did they would
[20:10] realize like you know either the
[20:12] government's going to have to come in
[20:13] and save you or you're literally going
[20:15] to have to start consuming less like
[20:18] literally eating less right if you can
[20:21] afford barely if you're just getting by
[20:23] right now and things get more expensive
[20:24] you're going to have to get worse food
[20:26] or less food and that's a huge huge huge
[20:29] problem uh in so many ways not just that
[20:32] alone but that causes unrest and that
[20:34] unrest
[20:35] causes like things that are worse than
[20:37] nightmares so I think there's a blending
[20:41] of the two the education can help people
[20:44] understand that they're in a very
[20:46] serious situation A very serious problem
[20:49] is amongst them and thankfully there
[20:52] actually is a solution there is
[20:53] something that you can do about it and
[20:54] on the other hand like when I go to a
[20:56] bar uh for some Bitcoin event here in in
[20:58] Los Angeles and the bartender I asked
[21:01] him hey is anybody tipping you in
[21:03] Bitcoin yet right like no like okay well
[21:06] what wallet do I have them get because
[21:07] most of the wallets here you have to
[21:09] take a photo of your ID you have to do
[21:11] all this kyc and it's like bartender is
[21:14] not going to do that right um and so
[21:17] that if I had good tools if wall Satoshi
[21:20] was still in the US you know um it would
[21:22] be much easier like I could have sent
[21:24] her Bitcoin in 10 seconds right so
[21:27] that's an example of how the tools can
[21:29] make it easier to bring people on um but
[21:32] again I think it's more an education
[21:35] issue I think the tools are more than
[21:37] good enough now we just need people to
[21:39] understand that they're in a very
[21:41] serious situation right now you
[21:44] know absolutely and I think that's an
[21:49] super uh super important point to to get
[21:53] people across to to recognize a problem
[21:55] and then once you know you have a
[21:58] problem um you're at least searching for
[22:00] solution and the possibility is way
[22:03] higher to find the right solution there
[22:06] are wrong solutions for inflation uh but
[22:09] but at least you have the chance to
[22:10] discover the the the wrong the right uh
[22:13] solution what are some interesting
[22:14] stories that you uh without getting um
[22:18] getting too much away from the movie but
[22:20] what are some interesting stories that
[22:21] you try to capture and to to to Really
[22:25] make people see that problem and maybe
[22:28] maybe also to what audience are trying
[22:31] to speak because um when when you talk
[22:34] with someone from Austria he probably
[22:36] has a different set of problems than
[22:39] someone from Nigeria or El Salvador and
[22:42] thinks about his life differently and
[22:44] they kind of have to be approached in a
[22:46] different way right
[22:49] so um yeah I think I kind of categorized
[22:54] people around the world in different
[22:56] intensities of inflation so so you're
[22:59] either in a country with single digit
[23:00] inflation double digit inflation triple
[23:03] digit inflation or quadruple digit
[23:04] inflation and so I think you will relate
[23:08] with anyone that's kind of in that same
[23:10] category as you you'll likely be living
[23:12] a similar kind of life and so um that's
[23:16] what I wanted to do to connect with
[23:18] people around the world is just
[23:19] interview regular people from you know
[23:21] single digit inflation countries double
[23:23] digit triple digit quadruple digit and I
[23:26] figured that would relate with pretty
[23:27] much everyone so
[23:29] you know of course those those stories
[23:30] are very powerful because um you can
[23:33] read about something and you can have an
[23:35] idea like oh yeah I can see how life
[23:37] would get you know under double- digit
[23:38] inflation but when you actually meet
[23:40] people and talk to them and you know you
[23:43] see their expressions you feel their
[23:45] emotion and what their life is like
[23:47] under those circumstances it becomes
[23:49] much more real you know so that's why
[23:51] also like I don't ever feel like I'm
[23:53] giving away anything about the film I'm
[23:54] happy to talk about any aspect of the
[23:56] film because in any way I describe it to
[23:58] you it's not going to be the same as you
[23:59] watching it you know you it's different
[24:02] you know the visuals and the emotions on
[24:04] people's faces it communicates a lot and
[24:07] so um so yeah meeting people and really
[24:10] seeing what life is like with inflation
[24:13] was very you know impactful uh like
[24:16] impressive on me and it made me realize
[24:18] that like the US is really trending in
[24:20] this direction I see so many aspects of
[24:23] you know Jamaica with double digit
[24:25] inflation Argentina with triple digit
[24:27] inflation you know in the US and so um
[24:31] and that was kind of like the darker
[24:32] side of the film that's really the first
[24:33] half of the film is illustrating the
[24:35] problem and again you know inflation is
[24:36] a huge problem I think inflation causes
[24:38] the most suffering in the world and so
[24:41] that's going to be pretty dark and that
[24:42] really inspired like the feel and the
[24:44] color of like the logo and the brand of
[24:46] it it felt like a horror movie to me you
[24:48] know to start um but then as we weave
[24:51] into Bitcoin you know those aspects of
[24:53] the film and those interviews are
[24:54] extremely hopeful like you know meeting
[24:57] people in Kenya who just got power
[24:58] reliable power for the first time
[25:00] they're living on dirt floors and
[25:02] aluminum walls and they're the happiest
[25:04] people I I met in my whole journey and
[25:07] uh they don't even know Bitcoin mining
[25:10] is what brought their grid the stability
[25:13] and like actually made it profitable for
[25:15] the power plant that was out there to
[25:18] serve them and they don't care right it
[25:20] doesn't really matter to them so it was
[25:23] it was it was just like having the those
[25:26] two blends of like really awful horrific
[25:30] stories and really hopeful optimistic
[25:32] stories I like for a while I think kind
[25:34] of numbed me like I felt like I don't
[25:37] know I maybe I haven't digested
[25:39] everything I've experienced because I
[25:41] keep getting pulled in both directions
[25:43] and but um but that's life and I think
[25:46] that's what makes the film so nice too
[25:47] is that it has the bitter and the sweet
[25:50] and um and you know at the end the film
[25:53] really ends in optimism I am very
[25:56] optimistic um but it is a matter of
[25:59] taking personal responsibility and
[26:00] everyone else out there taking personal
[26:02] responsibility so anyway lots of
[26:04] impactful interviews for sad reasons and
[26:07] for happy reasons um but yeah that's
[26:10] life right you can't you don't know good
[26:12] without bad so I think yeah I think it's
[26:15] appropriate absolutely and it it's h it
[26:18] feels good to feel the the bad sides uh
[26:22] and makes you appreciate the the good
[26:25] sides also I always uh say that about
[26:28] the Bitcoin price uh if if the Bitcoin
[26:30] price goes down like 50% don't feel 50%
[26:34] Dumber or like 50% worse than than you
[26:37] before but also don't feel like 100%
[26:41] better just because Bitcoin just 2X or
[26:43] something like that so I think we we
[26:46] kind of have to detach from uh from that
[26:49] a little bit and uh that's how I also
[26:52] approach those those kind of topics but
[26:54] I'm I'm curious with um a single digit
[26:57] and and double digit
[27:01] inflation how do you actually go ahead
[27:03] and measure like what metrics of
[27:05] inflation are you using in the movie
[27:07] because it's a whole another topic where
[27:10] maybe some some people would argue is
[27:12] there even a country with actual single
[27:15] digit inflation uh if you see it year
[27:18] over year yeah I agree with you I mean
[27:22] the numbers are based off the official
[27:25] numbers so I mean you know a lot of us
[27:27] know know that you probably can't trust
[27:29] those but I didn't want to get into that
[27:32] tangle you know with an average person I
[27:35] don't want to start like U you know
[27:36] going down that rabbit hole of are the
[27:38] numbers actually real because you'll
[27:40] have experts you know economists come
[27:43] out and say of course they're real how
[27:44] can you not trust them and then you have
[27:46] to talk about oh they're replacing items
[27:48] in the you know the CPI and like I
[27:50] didn't even want to get into that you
[27:52] know so um it's fine I give them the
[27:54] benefit of the doubt I use their
[27:56] statistics
[27:58] um but at the end of the day you know
[28:00] again I'm focusing more on human stories
[28:02] so yeah I use the official statistics
[28:04] that way I don't have to fight that
[28:06] battle um because uh yeah that's part of
[28:09] the journey I think when people dive
[28:11] deeper into Bitcoin they'll realize
[28:12] those numbers are actually uh much
[28:14] larger um but again I didn't want to
[28:17] fight that battle in this film I I you
[28:20] know I wanted to keep it as simple as
[28:22] possible you know for the average person
[28:24] so I think um it works you know even
[28:26] using their EXT extremely generous
[28:29] numbers it still is like profound and
[28:31] crazy ridiculous you know I partnered up
[28:34] with coin vigilante this is the most
[28:37] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[28:40] saw created by anyone look at that
[28:43] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[28:46] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[28:49] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[28:52] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[28:55] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[28:58] only and coin vigilante just dropped a
[29:00] completely new and amazing Genesis
[29:03] edition of their watch collections you
[29:06] have the date of the first ever mined
[29:09] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[29:12] also the block height and which EPO we
[29:15] are currently in I love the level of
[29:18] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[29:20] and make sure to check out those amazing
[29:23] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[29:26] descriptions I love those watch
[29:28] so so much if you watch or listen to my
[29:32] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[29:34] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[29:36] the most important step is to keep the
[29:39] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[29:42] wallet my personal recommendation for
[29:44] harder wallet is the bit box it's super
[29:47] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[29:49] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[29:51] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[29:54] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[29:58] at the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[30:02] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[30:04] step is to really level up your
[30:06] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[30:09] have the most secure self- custody setup
[30:12] you have to secure your own devices you
[30:15] have to protect your privacy you have to
[30:18] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[30:20] on where you live you even want to have
[30:23] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[30:25] move in case something goes really
[30:27] really wrong and through all those steps
[30:29] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[30:32] step by step and if you visit the
[30:35] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[30:38] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[30:41] out how you can level up your
[30:44] sovereignty yeah and I think you you
[30:46] cannot the the numbers um are so bad
[30:50] that you cannot make them look good in a
[30:55] sense and uh yeah so so even taking the
[30:59] official numbers I think will will be
[31:01] fine um but I I I always like to raise
[31:04] the awareness that um those numbers and
[31:09] it's just like one number of inflation
[31:11] and it's not the number of inflation um
[31:14] because of course it's correct number
[31:16] because they search for their baskets
[31:19] and their things and they put it in
[31:21] there but what you put in there makes a
[31:24] big difference uh to to measure it and I
[31:27] always encourage people especially when
[31:29] I meet new people think about what you
[31:32] are
[31:33] buying what what did you buy this year
[31:37] and last year and how do those prices
[31:40] compare to each other what are a
[31:42] restaurant build right now and what was
[31:44] a restaurant Bill five years ago uh what
[31:47] was your whatever subscription and what
[31:49] it is now so like uh I think that
[31:52] inflation rate is something highly um uh
[31:56] personal and subjective so that's what
[31:58] that's why I I like to bring that that
[32:00] that that topic up and it's really
[32:02] interesting when we then now get in the
[32:04] topic of what if there's no more
[32:06] inflation like what what if we move away
[32:09] from that system completely and we don't
[32:12] have those four categories of single
[32:14] double and and quadruple digit uh
[32:17] inflation but what if we have just like
[32:19] a little de deflation do you also go
[32:22] into the direction of what
[32:24] impact um that would have on people's
[32:28] life and and maybe seeing something in a
[32:31] Salvador or something like that already
[32:34] yeah so I didn't touch on deflation at
[32:37] all because again I felt like uh maybe
[32:40] for some average person they might like
[32:42] go okay that's crazy you know like maybe
[32:44] I can imagine life where prices stay the
[32:48] same that would be great but if you're
[32:49] telling me things are going to get
[32:50] cheaper like I don't know right so I
[32:53] didn't even go down that path at all but
[32:55] we do imagine what life would be like
[32:57] with no more inflation and the film
[32:58] defines inflation as you know money
[33:00] printing right some people will say well
[33:02] you know inflation is Technically when
[33:04] the cost of something goes up so like if
[33:06] you have a shortage of wheat one year
[33:08] and the bread cost doubles like that's
[33:10] inflation I don't think that's inflation
[33:12] that is not inflation that that is like
[33:15] just reality that's what happens
[33:17] obviously if there's less Supply and the
[33:20] same demand the price is going to go up
[33:22] inflation is the increase of monetary
[33:25] units right it is printing money so a
[33:28] world with no inflation means a world
[33:30] where there is no money Printing and um
[33:34] in that case that's a question I posed
[33:36] to pretty much everyone I interviewed
[33:38] including the people who spoke about
[33:41] where this printed money goes so like
[33:43] war and you know Food and Health and you
[33:46] know loans to other countries for
[33:48] foreign aid and you know bailouts for
[33:51] covid and the and the financial crisis
[33:53] of 2008 and so those people who spoke
[33:57] earlier in the film about
[33:59] how like what life is like living
[34:02] through their inflation or how you know
[34:04] money printing affects war and food and
[34:07] health and foreign aid and all these
[34:08] things I pose that question to them and
[34:10] so in the film they you know say what
[34:13] they how how they think their life would
[34:15] be different or how their industry would
[34:17] be different if money couldn't be
[34:19] printed and so like you know of course
[34:21] like the average person you know uh
[34:23] someone from Jamaica she said you know
[34:25] if I go to the store and milks a dollar
[34:28] today and it's a dollar tomorrow and
[34:31] it's a dollar next year and I can count
[34:33] on that like that's amazing you know and
[34:36] she's not a bitcoiner right and she
[34:38] doesn't know anything about Bitcoin
[34:40] really so she's like you know that
[34:41] sounds like a utopian world you know I
[34:43] don't know if it's possible you know it
[34:46] sounds like a fantasy and so um so
[34:49] anyway yes like uh those that that is
[34:51] touched on in the film uh so that people
[34:54] can start to imagine what life would be
[34:55] like without that and that's really the
[34:57] segue into Bitcoin we're saying like
[34:59] Okay well look here is this money that
[35:00] can't be printed this is why it can't be
[35:03] printed and again all the common fud
[35:06] you've heard you know energy crime
[35:08] volatility you know this is the other
[35:10] side of the story that maybe you haven't
[35:11] heard so like I was talking about the
[35:13] people I interviewed in Kenya I went out
[35:15] there to show the positive side of you
[35:17] know Bitcoin mining I also went to North
[35:19] Dakota where you can see people mining
[35:21] off of flare gas and reducing uh
[35:24] pollution um you know I went to El
[35:25] Salvador to show people actually using
[35:27] it
[35:28] I talked to financial adviser Morgan
[35:29] Rashard to talk about how it Compares
[35:32] against other investment assets U Alex
[35:34] gladstein about how you know it's it's
[35:37] actually a tool for human rights
[35:38] activism and how you know a lot of
[35:40] countries who say this person is a
[35:42] criminal yeah they're using it so yeah
[35:45] Bitcoin is kind of money for criminals
[35:47] and so um yeah anyway we we really start
[35:51] to dive into that and um imagining life
[35:54] without inflation and then really diving
[35:56] into these topics about
[35:58] Bitcoin yeah I also think that some
[36:01] people might not be ready for what
[36:03] consequences deflation means uh
[36:06] especially when you think about okay
[36:09] costs sync um people expect lower prices
[36:14] prices are lowering this also means that
[36:17] your salary might be in nominal terms
[36:22] decreasing uh year over year even though
[36:25] you make more purchasing power like you
[36:27] you you get more purchasing power year
[36:30] over year but your uh nominal Bitcoin
[36:35] value that you earn for your salary
[36:37] might actually decrease uh which is
[36:40] super interesting as I for example now
[36:43] get most of my money paid in Bitcoin and
[36:48] this number will likely to be decreased
[36:51] in the coming years uh if I don't grow a
[36:54] lot like I have to grow a lot to keep up
[36:57] with uh the Bitcoin price uh maybe if we
[37:00] have a crash next year or in a few years
[37:02] maybe then but overall I really have to
[37:05] work really hard to keep the same noral
[37:08] terms uh of of salary measured in
[37:11] Bitcoin I don't know if bit I don't know
[37:14] if people are ready for that reality but
[37:17] I guess we are seguing in very slowly
[37:20] there it is reality though right like
[37:23] even your Bitcoin is not actually wealth
[37:26] it's just a simp symbol of wealth right
[37:29] it's something that you expect to use in
[37:31] exchange of wealth food is wealth right
[37:34] like uh you know the goods the services
[37:36] the things that you need to live that's
[37:38] really wealth and so I think you're
[37:42] right though we have been used to this
[37:44] Society where price of things always go
[37:46] up and therefore your salary needs to
[37:48] always go up in terms of numbers um but
[37:51] I think it's a great question to ask an
[37:53] average person right um like do would
[37:56] you rather get paid more dollars every
[37:59] year but the dollars buy you less food
[38:02] and housing and energy or would you
[38:05] rather get paid less dollars every year
[38:08] but with those dollars you get more food
[38:10] more energy more housing right then I
[38:13] think people actually start to realize
[38:16] the reality which is the dollars the
[38:19] SATs the Bitcoin the number on The
[38:22] Ledger is not actually wealth it's what
[38:25] you can you know get for it at any given
[38:27] time so yeah it'll fundamentally change
[38:30] I think that's why Bitcoin is so
[38:32] profound that alone to have the
[38:35] understanding that it's okay that I make
[38:36] less because I'm able to get
[38:39] more like that's a good thing that is
[38:42] like a profound change in humanity right
[38:46] like if if everyone in the world
[38:48] actually understood that and that was
[38:50] the that was the reality we would be in
[38:51] a completely different world so yeah I
[38:54] agree with you and I think actually
[38:56] probably in a hundred years or in 200
[38:58] years or in a thousand years when they
[38:59] look back at this they're going to think
[39:01] dude those guys were so stupid they
[39:04] wanted more numbers in their phone
[39:08] instead of like more stuff they didn't
[39:10] see that this thing was so nasty and
[39:13] pernicious so yeah that's what I think
[39:17] absolutely and it's it's a great way um
[39:19] but what do you think uh will be other
[39:23] consequences of that world like um once
[39:26] we get to no more inflation or deflation
[39:29] or like whatever the the we call it or
[39:34] disinflationary um once we get to the
[39:36] Bitcoin World um what are the
[39:38] consequences of that and how different
[39:40] will our our world be so I think what's
[39:43] going to happen is all of the things
[39:45] that we buy and produce right now that
[39:47] are unnecessary they're going to go away
[39:50] um at least during the transition I
[39:53] think the things that people actually
[39:55] need and that act provides you
[39:59] health are going to be extremely
[40:01] expensive I think like food and um
[40:06] Health Care um those are the main things
[40:10] like food for me is the obvious one like
[40:12] food is getting worse and worse right
[40:14] now um if it's going to keep getting
[40:16] more expensive the only way a lot of
[40:18] people are going to be able to eat is
[40:19] what the government gives them and the
[40:21] government's always going to have an
[40:22] incentive to make it cheaper and cheaper
[40:24] which naturally will have less and less
[40:26] nutrients which will cause more health
[40:28] issues so I think we're going to Trend
[40:32] back to a civilization that produces
[40:34] more of what is needed versus you know
[40:38] just trivial kind of things and so I
[40:42] mean obviously like think about all the
[40:44] jobs in the uh in in mortgages like you
[40:47] know mortgage brokers and um uh you know
[40:51] accountants and uh lawyers and like all
[40:54] of these things that don't really
[40:56] produce much they're going to go away
[40:59] and I think more people are going to
[41:00] have to produce their own food um I
[41:04] think it'll just make more sense you'll
[41:05] save so much money by producing your own
[41:07] food and um yeah we'll go back to what's
[41:10] important you know that's one of the
[41:11] things that I found in common with
[41:12] bitcoiners is it you know Bitcoin
[41:15] dematerializes you because you start
[41:17] measuring everything in Bitcoin like do
[41:19] I really want this thing or would I
[41:20] rather save for the future you know and
[41:23] and then you start weeding out a lot of
[41:25] things in your life but then for me
[41:27] least what I realize is one thing I'm
[41:29] always fine with spending money on is
[41:31] like getting together with people my
[41:33] friends my family people I love you know
[41:35] having a barbecue those things don't
[41:37] cost very much money but they're like
[41:39] way more important than most of the
[41:41] things that I used to spend my money on
[41:43] so I think we're all just going to start
[41:46] valuing things that are
[41:49] actually valuable and that's going to
[41:51] cut out a lot of stuff and so again I
[41:54] think certain things will get very
[41:56] expensive you know maybe you think
[41:58] you're stacking for your uh
[42:00] multi-generational wealth but maybe
[42:01] you're just stacking to be able to
[42:03] survive through the transition
[42:04] comfortably um but I think yeah
[42:06] naturally we'll have to Trend towards
[42:09] producing things that actually are
[42:11] valuable and I look forward to it
[42:13] because we should have better food then
[42:14] you know if more people are farming and
[42:15] growing and you know like actually
[42:17] focusing on food we're going to have
[42:19] better food like the food you get from
[42:20] your grocery store is [ __ ] versus
[42:22] picking it off of a tomato Vine right so
[42:25] again we will that's the benefit we're
[42:27] going to have much higher quality things
[42:30] that we actually need houses will be
[42:32] better food will be better energy will
[42:34] be better um and then yeah the world's
[42:37] going to develop from there in a
[42:39] completely different direction than this
[42:41] consumerism materialism spending money
[42:43] on [ __ ] like we're going to have a
[42:45] completely different Society it's uh
[42:47] more efficient and more quality that
[42:49] that that's kind of the the best of the
[42:52] best hopefully we get
[42:54] there really interesting um how
[42:59] has how how long have you uh observed
[43:02] Bitcoin
[43:03] now uh Bitcoin it's been um I really
[43:07] started looking into it around 2019 2020
[43:10] so it's been like four or five years now
[43:12] interesting how would you say in the
[43:15] last like five year has the uh
[43:18] perspective and the stance on bitcoin
[43:20] changed in in media in general for
[43:24] you yeah I think um it's it's changed a
[43:27] lot more recently with Trump and you
[43:29] know the price going up like people are
[43:31] becoming and black rock and the ETFs
[43:34] like so much has happened in the last
[43:35] few years so and of course inflation
[43:38] right like four years ago no one was
[43:40] really talking about inflation at all
[43:42] you know even though it was there um so
[43:45] I think a lot has changed I really think
[43:47] the world is primed and ready for uh
[43:50] something like Bitcoin you know and
[43:52] selfishly it's why I made the film too I
[43:54] I want as many people as possible to
[43:57] stack SATs so we can distribute this
[43:59] wealth as much as possible so that
[44:01] whatever transition comes we have more
[44:04] strong people to deal with it right like
[44:07] you can't help anybody else unless you
[44:08] help yourself and if you help yourself
[44:11] very well you can actually help a lot of
[44:13] other people and you can make them
[44:15] strong and then they can help other
[44:16] people and so um yeah I think a lot has
[44:20] changed in the last four years and I
[44:22] expect in the next four years even more
[44:24] will change because inflation is an
[44:26] exponential thing it doesn't you know
[44:29] climb at the same rate it goes faster
[44:31] and faster and when you boil the frogs
[44:34] um something's going to happen you know
[44:36] uh and in the past government has
[44:38] pointed at different groups of people
[44:39] Farmers or businessmen or whoever is
[44:41] saying it's not us it's them go get them
[44:45] right uh so maybe we'll see some of that
[44:47] um but people are distrusting of the
[44:50] government right now they're dist
[44:51] trusting of the the mainstream media you
[44:53] know a lot of them and so I think we're
[44:54] in good shape but um
[44:58] but yeah A lot's changed and I think a
[44:59] lot more is going to change like I think
[45:02] whatever happened in the last four years
[45:03] in the next one year we're going to
[45:05] experience something you know similar
[45:07] especially like Elon and and vivc and
[45:09] Trump right are are out there to try to
[45:11] fight back against inflation and maybe
[45:13] some people actually have hope that
[45:14] they're going to be able to do something
[45:16] you know bring the prices down or keep
[45:18] the prices the same and when that
[45:19] doesn't happen and prices keep going up
[45:22] I think people are really going to have
[45:24] to look at themselves in the mirror and
[45:25] say what am I going to do about this am
[45:29] I just going to trust the government's
[45:31] going to save me or am I actually going
[45:33] to do something about this um so again I
[45:37] think we're in great shape I I uh I'm
[45:39] I'm very optimistic about the future but
[45:41] yeah a lot has
[45:43] changed what do you think about uh you
[45:45] you're in Los Angeles you're in America
[45:49] I presume um what do you think about the
[45:53] the directional change from Biden to
[45:56] Trump now which will happen not even a
[45:59] month from now I
[46:01] think yeah we'll see you know like a lot
[46:04] of bitcoiners I don't really care too
[46:05] much about politics cuz I feel like you
[46:08] know literally if I just do push-ups
[46:10] every day it would change my life more
[46:12] than whoever the president is um and
[46:15] I've heard Arguments for both ways like
[46:17] obviously with Biden and kamla people
[46:20] were saying that they were going to be
[46:21] printing a lot more money because they
[46:23] wanted to provide health care for
[46:25] anybody who came into the borders and
[46:27] that that would be a positive thing
[46:29] because it would pump the price of
[46:30] Bitcoin and then more people get
[46:32] attracted to bitcoin and you know I
[46:34] don't know if that would be better with
[46:36] trump it seems like um even though I
[46:38] think he prior to co had printed the
[46:41] most money I think he had the biggest
[46:43] deficit um but again there's inflation
[46:45] right so anyway like they both like to
[46:47] print money um so that's really my only
[46:50] metric all I care about is how much
[46:52] money are you printing I don't care
[46:54] about red or blue or whatever because I
[46:57] know at the end of the day that has the
[46:59] biggest impact on people around the
[47:02] world so when Trump comes out and says
[47:04] hey I'm going to interest rates are too
[47:06] high which I understand because you know
[47:09] the net interest the US government pays
[47:11] is like larger than defense the defense
[47:13] budget right now so of course they want
[47:16] lower interest rates um but what does
[47:19] that do you're going to flood the market
[47:20] with money people are going to refinance
[47:22] their homes people are going to buy
[47:23] homes it's going to drive the price of
[47:25] homes up once again it's like there's
[47:28] there's there's no way out of it so um I
[47:31] forget the original question but I feel
[47:33] like I answered
[47:34] it yeah absolutely asked I asked about
[47:38] the US politics uh change uh right now
[47:41] with the direction it's also interesting
[47:43] when we look at it where there's now
[47:46] companies coming into Bitcoin uh there
[47:49] seems to be maybe even countries coming
[47:51] into Bitcoin but retail I don't know how
[47:55] you feel about it but retail
[47:57] seems to be asleep still like it seems
[47:59] to be very
[48:01] calm it it seems to be not that worried
[48:04] and even the 100K doesn't make that huge
[48:07] of a difference at least in in my area
[48:09] not uh how do do you do you see the same
[48:12] thing and and how do you think of like
[48:15] um institutions and companies are now
[48:17] more aggressively coming into Bitcoin
[48:19] than than the retail folks and normal
[48:21] folks and even countries to a certain
[48:24] extent yeah so I think of course what's
[48:27] going to happen is going to happen you
[48:28] know again one of the reasons why I made
[48:30] the film was to try to reach the average
[48:32] person um because I think that's
[48:35] important I think it's interesting when
[48:37] these traditional Finance people are
[48:39] coming in now and um you know they're
[48:42] talk I've Heard lots of them you know
[48:44] talk about like who cares about retail
[48:46] now like retail doesn't have all the
[48:47] money anyway you know it's like the
[48:49] institutional money that's what they
[48:51] want but they forget that uh this is a
[48:54] quote I've been saying lately but a rich
[48:55] man's wealth is in his City you know
[48:58] it's in the services and the goods that
[48:59] you get it's the chef that cooks you
[49:01] that that you know grills that steak for
[49:03] you and so you know if you actually want
[49:07] better things you should want your
[49:09] neighbor to be you know happier and
[49:10] healthier and that's retail so um yeah
[49:14] that's what it seems like to me um I
[49:16] mean I definitely have had some people
[49:18] reach out to me since since 100K but it
[49:21] doesn't even seem like it was the same
[49:23] as when it first hit like 60k or 69k
[49:27] that was in my opinion like there was
[49:29] more retail like interest and you know
[49:32] curiosity about it but now it doesn't
[49:33] seem like we've quite hit that number
[49:35] yet which maybe makes me think we're
[49:36] going to go a lot higher right because
[49:38] what's the number going to have to be
[49:39] before people are like holy [ __ ] like
[49:42] the average person you know I need to
[49:43] get some of this you know is it 150 is
[49:44] it 200 is it 250 I don't know I don't
[49:48] care you know but I know what will be
[49:50] will be um and you know it's it's funny
[49:53] because actually now that I finish this
[49:54] film I'm I'm at peace because you know I
[49:57] felt like film is what I do best and
[49:58] there wasn't really a film like this
[50:00] that existed and if I could help
[50:02] Enlighten the average person to get more
[50:04] Bitcoin perhaps you know would
[50:06] contribute to a better world so I've
[50:08] done my part you know the film's out
[50:10] there and available and I think it's one
[50:11] of the best tools to actually get retail
[50:14] interested in some way uh to bitcoin but
[50:17] again at the end of the day you know we
[50:19] we'll see what happens and uh time will
[50:21] tell us but I don't think anyone any any
[50:24] one of us really knows but I do hope
[50:26] that retail gets in because again I
[50:28] think it'll just provide a smoother
[50:30] transition absolutely uh which
[50:35] is I I hope for for retail to be a
[50:38] bigger part of of the whole whole story
[50:41] um but it's interesting if What number
[50:44] has to hit yeah I never had that
[50:47] question actually I never thought about
[50:48] that um like if if 100K is not the
[50:51] number what is the number is it
[50:55] 250k I retail just waking up if it's a
[50:58] million like what has to happen for for
[51:01] them to like oh oh gosh Bitcoin is at
[51:03] that now let's take let let me take a
[51:06] second look at this one let me me AR in
[51:11] Argentina um you know people are wanting
[51:14] to get rid of their pesos and for
[51:16] dollars because the peso is constantly
[51:18] going down in value against the dollar
[51:19] so yeah if we ever hit that kind of
[51:21] period where it's just like consistently
[51:23] going up in Bitcoin for sure retail is
[51:26] going to jump because at that point they
[51:27] don't need to know about Bitcoin all
[51:29] they know is that every day or every
[51:31] week or every month they have less
[51:33] dollars you know and if they would just
[51:34] put it in Bitcoin it goes up then you
[51:36] know that that's the end of the game but
[51:39] yeah until then yeah I don't know I
[51:41] think 250 like you're saying might be
[51:43] the number uh it also depends on how
[51:45] fast we get there right like if it rips
[51:47] 20 grand in a day maybe that gets some
[51:50] attention too who knows do you imagine
[51:53] that we uh come to like a suddenly phase
[51:57] where we hit like a Bitcoin Gold Rush
[51:59] moment uh uh for for
[52:02] Bitcoin it's interesting because I like
[52:05] to compare it to wear Germany during the
[52:07] hyperinflation and if you look at the
[52:09] price of gold at that time like the
[52:10] chart is crazy dude it's crazy like one
[52:14] month Gold is like you know whatever
[52:17] like you know like like a million
[52:19] percent more or less than the next month
[52:21] you know it's like insane so I wonder if
[52:24] we're going to hit something like that
[52:26] um
[52:27] you know
[52:28] um we'll see because so far the bull
[52:30] runs have been kind of like a year or a
[52:32] year and a half or two years where the
[52:33] price goes up and then it comes down
[52:35] significantly but I think if we spend
[52:37] more time than that and we're
[52:39] consistently climbing climbing climbing
[52:41] climbing climbing and people are
[52:43] literally like whoa like every month I'm
[52:45] holding my dollars it's losing value yes
[52:48] I think that there will be a Gold Rush
[52:50] people will want to Pile in naturally
[52:52] just like they do in Argentina right now
[52:54] to get rid of the peso for the dollar
[52:56] like when I was there literally like I
[52:57] didn't want to hold pesos overnight
[52:59] because I could get more pesos the next
[53:00] day like I would try to exchange just
[53:02] the amount that I needed you know for
[53:04] that day and if I was at the end of the
[53:06] day like had more pesos I was going to
[53:08] try to spend those pesos so if that
[53:10] happens people are just going to Pile in
[53:13] but I don't know if that will lead you
[53:15] know H how does that work are people
[53:17] going to they can't all have utxos on
[53:20] chain right so are they going to have
[53:21] some lightning wallet that has a
[53:24] custodian and then at some point in the
[53:26] future there's going to be a huge
[53:28] rugging where a lot of people are going
[53:29] to lose their money maybe the price of
[53:31] Bitcoin collapses at that time you know
[53:34] but um yeah I think the Gold Rush will
[53:37] happen if we have a nice consistent
[53:39] climb in bitcoin's price um people will
[53:42] just go well this is better money like
[53:44] obviously so I'm just going to put my
[53:46] money here instead and you um mentioned
[53:50] that gold I think probably you're
[53:52] talking about that thing where we have
[53:56] Bim marks uh it's from
[54:00] 1914 uh starts at one mark the gold
[54:04] price uh and it goes till
[54:08] 1923 at the end it's at I don't know I
[54:11] don't even know how big the number is
[54:13] 100
[54:14] million uh that is then
[54:17] 10 what is that 10 I think that's a
[54:20] trillion I think at yeah 10 10 billion
[54:22] yeah I think at the very top is looks
[54:24] like 1 trillion thousand million billion
[54:27] trillion yeah a trillion per at the top
[54:29] oh man and and it's interesting because
[54:32] there that's the gold price in V Mark so
[54:34] it's starts at one and it ends at like a
[54:36] trillion or like whatever the huge
[54:39] numberers and in the red line you see
[54:42] here the percentage change in gold price
[54:45] on a monthly basis we see here on the
[54:48] left side
[54:50] 160%
[54:52] monthly uh and you see it going up and
[54:55] down like crazy like really huge
[54:58] volatility that's why I'm also saying
[55:02] volatility is now here and we are kind
[55:04] of now at the starting point of of that
[55:07] whole thing and I think um volatility in
[55:11] Bitcoin will go up we will have bigger
[55:14] swings and this whole thing of
[55:17] diminishing returns and this whole thing
[55:19] of like uh even like the power law I
[55:22] think it's BS when we measured that in
[55:26] US dollar it might be interesting to
[55:28] look like Bitcoin versus gold I think
[55:31] then we we can make power lws and models
[55:33] and stuff like that but if we compare
[55:35] Bitcoin to US dollar and Fiats uh we
[55:38] will get a chart like that with those
[55:40] kind of monthly candles uh and and that
[55:43] will be super interesting uh to to see
[55:47] and uh like bugle up and as you said
[55:51] before like keep keep stacking uh so you
[55:53] survive those kind of crazy s
[55:56] and be prepared for that we we are just
[55:58] entering that that scene right now yeah
[56:01] and look what I see for this chart from
[56:03] like 1917 to
[56:05] 1923 like I want to have all my own food
[56:09] like I don't want to pay for food at
[56:11] this point you know what I mean and if
[56:13] anything I want to be the guy that has
[56:15] food to sell this is where you're going
[56:16] to be stacking SATs through the
[56:18] transition is 1917 to 1923 and then 1923
[56:22] when things start to level off man you
[56:25] got that you're purchasing power is
[56:26] going to be insane with whatever stats
[56:28] you have left over so that's what I'm
[56:30] thinking you know I I think it's
[56:32] possible we have a very very smooth
[56:34] transition as more bitcoiners like us
[56:36] are becoming wealthier un able to do
[56:38] things um but it could be like crazy and
[56:42] so yeah during those swings like that
[56:45] where that mountain really starts to
[56:46] climb yeah I I want to be I want I want
[56:50] to need to pay for as little things as
[56:52] possible during that period also I think
[56:55] in those periods um we want to have as
[56:59] much control over the asset as possible
[57:03] I would be very worried uh in that
[57:06] period of time from like let's say
[57:10] 198
[57:11] 199 to the 1923 period where this is
[57:16] such a high volatility where Bitcoin is
[57:19] every day in the news cycle where it's a
[57:22] political topic that there are rich
[57:25] Bitcoins and stuff like that that um you
[57:28] want to have all the control over your
[57:31] Bitcoin and you want to have it in self
[57:33] custody uh and you don't want to have a
[57:36] Bitcoin proxy you want to have real
[57:39] Bitcoin uh and that's that's where where
[57:42] I'm really passionate about uh Bitcoin
[57:44] and self custody especially in those
[57:47] times and I think we will get there and
[57:50] that's where yes self custody is a
[57:52] little bit more uh inconvenient you
[57:55] maybe have have to pay more for that and
[57:57] stuff like that uh you have to dive
[58:00] deeper but it is worth it because just
[58:04] because of that chart I couldn't sleep
[58:06] otherwise if I have all my Bitcoin not
[58:08] in self custody I couldn't sleep with
[58:10] that chart
[58:12] honestly yeah this is what um I tell
[58:14] people who talk about borrowing against
[58:17] their Bitcoin like oh it's okay like
[58:19] I'll just be able to borrow at some
[58:20] point I'll be able to borrow against my
[58:22] Bitcoin and just like it'll just like a
[58:23] house does these days it'll go up in
[58:25] price then I can borrow it against it
[58:27] again and it's like you're going to give
[58:29] up custody of twice the value of Bitcoin
[58:33] right if you want a million dollar loan
[58:34] you're going to probably have to give
[58:36] them $2 million worth of bitcoin to for
[58:39] to make up for the potential volatility
[58:41] right so you're going to lose custody of
[58:43] $2 million worth of bitcoin for a
[58:45] million dollars worth of bitcoin and if
[58:47] we go through those
[58:49] swings man you're going to be really
[58:52] nervous if it's not in your custody and
[58:54] it's somewhere else because
[58:56] yeah so I I agree with you completely
[58:58] it's not even just for people who leave
[59:00] it on the exchange right now or think oh
[59:02] I can't trust myself to save 12 words or
[59:05] 24 words it's also the people who are
[59:07] thinking like I'm just going to be able
[59:08] to borrow against this forever I don't
[59:11] think so I think you're going to be
[59:12] giving it to me to you know to give you
[59:14] some stake you know during that
[59:16] transitioner
[59:18] period you should uh like don't
[59:23] exper Bitcoin is already such a fast
[59:27] horse don't put on a
[59:30] fancy um swing don't put a fancy thing
[59:33] on top of the horse just to make it like
[59:36] 5% better or 10% better and borrowing
[59:39] against it playing with credit first of
[59:41] all even if nothing happens you really
[59:44] have to know what you're doing even if
[59:45] we don't hit that crazy thing of
[59:49] volatility which I think we hit um you
[59:52] have to know exactly what you're doing
[59:54] otherwise you will end up with less
[59:56] Bitcoin anyways uh so yeah it's it's a
[60:00] it's a difficult topic because human
[60:03] Creed is full at
[60:06] work with those topics absolutely I
[60:09] agree really cool um one thing that I
[60:12] want to get into with you uh before we
[60:14] get to in the end routine is a Bitcoin
[60:18] culture uh and how how you see it as
[60:23] with with a Bitcoin movie also probably
[60:26] try to to capture a little bit of the
[60:28] Bitcoin culture and then capture a
[60:30] little bit this this the sense of of
[60:32] Bitcoin and you you get it anyways if
[60:34] you talk to to to the Bitcoin and you
[60:37] have great uh people in there saw two
[60:40] Master uh the interview it was really
[60:42] really cool what you did in there um H
[60:46] what's your what's your current sense of
[60:48] the Bitcoin culture what makes it
[60:51] special and what is your like uh how has
[60:54] that involved also over the years so I
[60:56] think the main takeway from the culture
[60:58] is to take responsibility for yourself
[61:02] you know I think that's really like the
[61:06] Baseline of all of the most important
[61:08] aspects of it right I mean bitcoiners
[61:11] come in all shapes and sizes and flavors
[61:13] and anybody can call themselves a
[61:14] Bitcoin or at the end of the day you
[61:16] know like each individual person decides
[61:19] what a Bitcoin or is so for me it's
[61:21] somebody who takes personal
[61:23] responsibility and increasingly more
[61:26] more personal responsibility um and so
[61:29] you know of course how can you take
[61:30] responsibility if you don't have your
[61:32] own Keys you know and your own wallet in
[61:34] your old C in your own Cold
[61:35] Storage um and so I think that's the
[61:39] biggest takeaway I think um you know
[61:44] everyone's going through their journey
[61:46] and a lot of people still lean on like
[61:48] credibility and credentials and like uh
[61:51] oh you know I listen to this person
[61:53] because they're smart or whatever and
[61:55] even inside Bitcoin space but um you
[61:58] know I think there's a saying like Kill
[61:59] Your Heroes I think I think more and
[62:02] more I'm not sure if more people are
[62:04] killing their heroes or more people are
[62:07] uh acquiring
[62:08] Heroes um so I think that that's the
[62:12] only thing I kind of pay attention to is
[62:14] like you know how many people out there
[62:15] are actually thinking for themselves and
[62:18] um in my opinion that's really what a
[62:20] what a bitcoiner is somebody who takes
[62:22] responsibility and like the foundation
[62:23] of that is thinking for yourself
[62:25] actually having thoughts for yourself
[62:27] and uh doing your own research so uh you
[62:30] know of course a bunch of other things
[62:31] get tied in right like there's
[62:33] carnivores out there people that only
[62:34] eat steak I'm one of them I mean I cheat
[62:37] a bit but like it's just what's made me
[62:39] feel the best is like eating as much
[62:41] meat as possible um and you know the 100
[62:45] push-ups until 100K like that's a great
[62:48] idea in my opinion you know I think some
[62:51] people take it like as like this Macho
[62:53] masculine thing and hey we don't have to
[62:55] all be like you know jacked Bros but for
[62:58] me it's not about that it's just about
[62:59] health like if you do 100 push-ups
[63:01] you're just going to be physically much
[63:03] more prepared for like even like some
[63:06] crazy altercation in your life you know
[63:08] or if you have to run away from some
[63:09] crazy homeless person with a knife or
[63:11] something like you're going to be in
[63:12] better shape you know so a lot of other
[63:14] things get pulled into it but I think
[63:16] again at the core of all that is just
[63:17] taking responsibility for yourself and
[63:21] um yeah that's what I think very true
[63:24] and uh this this is kind of where I
[63:27] always uh go with the Bitcoin
[63:30] culture they are thinking about their
[63:33] health they're thinking about what is
[63:35] best for the body because they have the
[63:37] time back like they because of Bitcoin
[63:40] it allows them to uh think about those
[63:43] things because the M money the
[63:45] fundamental layer all of the sudden is
[63:47] fixed in their life and that's where I
[63:49] really have a lot of Hope For What
[63:51] Bitcoin can do for Humanity basically so
[63:55] I'm really hopeful for for that and uh
[63:57] hope to see that in a really really big
[64:00] way really cool thank you so much I have
[64:02] one question that I asked each and every
[64:04] one of my guests is what can we learn
[64:06] from you besides Bitcoin yeah
[64:10] um
[64:12] well of course a lot of people who are
[64:15] um interested in making films themselves
[64:17] or content you know have lots of
[64:19] questions about the equipment I use or
[64:21] how I organize my process and different
[64:23] things like that so anybody out there
[64:25] who's interested in that can reach out
[64:27] to me I'm happy to you know share my
[64:29] time and my knowledge um other than that
[64:32] like you know the only other thing I
[64:33] really focus on a lot is um like what I
[64:36] eat and my posture and I think posture
[64:38] is probably more unique than what other
[64:40] people talk about um but I've you know
[64:43] had posture issues my whole life you
[64:45] know worked on a computer for many years
[64:47] played video games for many years had
[64:49] different um broken bones that kind of
[64:52] you know um caused me to be in bad
[64:54] posture when I was younger and so I
[64:57] realized for myself growing out of that
[65:00] and obtaining closer to perfect posture
[65:03] it's not perfect yet but it's much
[65:04] better it's made me feel like a
[65:06] completely different person I feel much
[65:09] more willing to do difficult things much
[65:11] more willing to exercise much clearer
[65:14] and calmer and so um yeah that's what I
[65:17] would that's the other thing outside of
[65:19] Bitcoin that I would encourage anybody
[65:20] else to do like if you have another goal
[65:22] in your life try to obtain perfect
[65:25] posture and make it that position that
[65:27] your body
[65:28] naturally sits in when you're just
[65:31] relaxing and I think it's going to cause
[65:33] your blood to flow better it's going to
[65:35] cause your chemicals to flow better
[65:36] there's studies like when you're upright
[65:38] and straight you release more
[65:39] testosterone when you're over curled
[65:42] over like this it's more cortisol so
[65:43] it's more of like a stress hormone fight
[65:45] ORF flight type of thing and so um yeah
[65:48] that's why I think it'll it'll make you
[65:50] feel like a completely different person
[65:51] so yeah that's my answer to that I love
[65:54] that uh I think we never talked about
[65:57] posture but in in this segment of the
[66:00] show a lot of things come up and a lot
[66:01] of interesting ideas and inputs come
[66:04] from guest and and I love that uh but I
[66:07] think post actually never we talked
[66:10] about um uh foots and and Barefoot stuff
[66:14] and and stuff like that to improve the
[66:16] posture and improve the overall uh
[66:19] things like that but yeah posture it it
[66:22] it took me
[66:23] 337 uh podcasts to to get to posture I'm
[66:27] loving it really really cool thank you
[66:29] so much we have entertain in the podcast
[66:31] where uh the previous guest is ask a
[66:34] question for the next guest without
[66:35] knowing who the next guest actually is
[66:37] and your question from the previous
[66:39] guest is um how has Bitcoin changed
[66:44] your approach or perspective on
[66:47] consumerism and uh the low time
[66:50] preference on on buying things right
[66:53] yeah so I touched on it a little bit
[66:54] earlier but yeah think Bitcoin material
[66:57] dematerializes you um because again it
[67:00] becomes something to compare every
[67:01] purchase against and so it's like do I
[67:06] really want this thing so bad that I'm
[67:08] not willing to have four of them like in
[67:11] in in four years you know or 10 of them
[67:13] instead and so um yeah for me it's
[67:17] definitely had that effect and and again
[67:19] with trimming all of those things out it
[67:21] really allowed me to highlight the
[67:23] things that actually work important and
[67:26] it's funny because they're they're not
[67:28] the consumerism stuff right it's like
[67:31] yeah like I was saying before it's it's
[67:32] it's time with friends and and the
[67:34] memories that you make uh during that
[67:36] and that realization has yeah it's it's
[67:40] it's made me more aware of that and it's
[67:42] made me seek those those memories more
[67:45] and so because of
[67:47] Bitcoin I have less stupid things and
[67:50] I've had I've made so many more friends
[67:52] and made so many more memories and
[67:54] enjoyed so many more Stakes like I find
[67:56] most of my money gets spent on Stakes
[67:58] you know what I mean maybe someone
[67:59] thinks it's crazy to buy like you know
[68:02] like U like tomahawks for five people
[68:04] you know Tomahawk stakes and like you
[68:05] know spend 60 70 $100 on each of them
[68:08] but it's like that's the only thing what
[68:10] I spend my money on like I I don't you
[68:12] know and and and I know whenever I'm
[68:14] with friends it's totally worth that
[68:17] amount of money spent in so yeah again
[68:19] and I think it speaks to what I think
[68:21] the future is going to be like imagine
[68:22] more and more and more people
[68:23] dematerializing and not buying into
[68:25] these consumer things because they have
[68:27] a money to to save you know we're we're
[68:30] going to move away from those wasteful
[68:32] activities and more people are going to
[68:34] spend time doing things that are
[68:35] actually important and again in those
[68:38] areas that are actually important we're
[68:39] just going to have better stuff so yeah
[68:42] it's changed me a lot I think it's going
[68:43] to change everyone else and it's going
[68:45] to make us all happier at the end of the
[68:48] day thank you so much for for being on
[68:51] the show um that that is very true I
[68:54] agree with that a lot and I hope to see
[68:56] that um before I let you go where can
