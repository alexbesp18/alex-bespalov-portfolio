[00:00] if our money's purchasing power is
[00:01] increasing over time then that means as
[00:03] time goes by we have greater capacity to
[00:05] show up people are working so hard the
[00:06] cost of living is so expensive that
[00:08] people feel stuck this is something that
[00:09] has really opened my eyes to seeing that
[00:12] we do have the potential for a Rosy
[00:13] future whereas only a handful of years
[00:15] ago I thought the world was quite a dark
[00:17] place when a money is broken it shapes
[00:19] society and it shapes Society in very
[00:21] negative ways on a Bitcoin standard we
[00:23] will have separated money from state
[00:24] that means that the state or the
[00:26] government has to compete like any other
[00:28] business if the government itself is not
[00:29] fiscally responsible then it's going to
[00:31] wither away and that allows another
[00:33] government that offers value that
[00:34] listens to the populace to rise up hey
[00:36] look this country is spending a lot of
[00:37] money on war that must mean the populist
[00:39] supports War but that's not the case on
[00:40] a Bitcoin standard if the populist do
[00:42] not support war and they withhold paying
[00:44] taxes that government can no longer go
[00:46] and fund Wars and that government walks
[00:47] quickly wither away and another one will
[00:49] rise up if you've got a pure free market
[00:51] then ultimately it could end up like Mad
[00:53] Max when we start looking at the world
[00:54] through the lens of Bitcoin all of a
[00:56] sudden hey I want to save in this thing
[00:57] because over time my cost of living goes
[00:59] down in relation to bigco as time goes
[01:01] by as the pain increases at some point
[01:04] the pain to hold on to our leld beliefs
[01:06] our world beliefs becomes lesser than
[01:08] the pain that we are immediately feeling
[01:10] in terms of hey I can't even afford to
[01:13] feed my family right
[01:14] [Music]
[01:17] now you you were not in prag right you
[01:19] from America no I I I live in the small
[01:22] little ski town of Whistler uh north of
[01:24] Vancouver in Canada and I I wanted to
[01:26] make it to Prague so badly Prague in
[01:28] just in general terms as a city is just
[01:30] such an incredible City but I'd love to
[01:32] make it to prag one of these days it's
[01:34] just a it's like a 9h hour flight yeah
[01:37] it's it's one of those I hear that a lot
[01:39] I I am only in brag for like this is my
[01:41] only big conference I go at least till
[01:43] now uh but the feedback I is like it's
[01:46] one of the only conferences that's like
[01:48] really Bitcoin only it's like the this
[01:50] this Bitcoin thing and not like oh
[01:53] there's also this the small [ __ ] things
[01:55] in into the Bitcoin conference so I like
[01:58] that but I've not been to other Bitcoin
[02:00] conferences I have to say we earlier in
[02:03] the year I had the opportunity to go to
[02:04] Madera for uh Bitcoin Atlantis and that
[02:08] was unbelievable I've never been to uh
[02:11] any of the Bitcoin Miami any of the big
[02:13] big conferences and so even just to be a
[02:15] Bitcoin Atlantis and Madera was such an
[02:17] incredible opportunity and Andre the guy
[02:19] who kind of founded and kind of set up
[02:22] the whole event did such a phenomenal
[02:23] job yeah there's something there's
[02:25] something about just hanging out with
[02:27] bitcoiners that is just so refreshing I
[02:30] feel like the world at which we live in
[02:32] unfortunately people are very scared to
[02:34] voice their opinions and when it comes
[02:35] to bitcoiners I feel like people have
[02:37] done a lot of work trying to formulate
[02:39] their opinions and they're open in their
[02:41] opinions and so you can have these
[02:43] phenomenal conversations and even if you
[02:44] disagree with someone you're you're open
[02:46] to kind of pushing it back a little bit
[02:49] you're open to having that kind of
[02:50] debate but it's it's very friendly and
[02:52] so I I always value bitcoiners I also
[02:55] saw that Bitcoin is are more likely to
[02:58] actually find common ground I have this
[03:00] convers this this one example that I
[03:02] brought up a few times in the podcast
[03:04] where I sat at a Bitcoin conference or
[03:06] Bitcoin Meetup actually like there were
[03:07] like 100 people or something like that
[03:09] and there was in front of me a wegan and
[03:11] a carnivore like the the the one was
[03:14] actually like I only want to eat meat
[03:16] other one was like a raw Wing so which
[03:19] was really interesting to see and the
[03:21] conversation was so loving and and so
[03:23] respectful and they kind of agreed like
[03:25] oh fresh food is good make it uh
[03:27] homemade cood like they they to find out
[03:30] like common ground and and this is kind
[03:32] of where we might end up with a Bitcoin
[03:35] standard because all of a sudden when
[03:36] when Bitcoin is the global standard uh
[03:38] which is a very very very long way but
[03:42] when we have this global standard do you
[03:43] think also that like Bitcoin could unite
[03:46] us or because there's also this this few
[03:48] like H Bitcoin is just money in the end
[03:50] of the day it doesn't [ __ ] doesn't do
[03:52] [ __ ] for for society but uh how do you
[03:55] see that I I I wholeheartedly agree I
[03:58] think that what is so f ating about
[04:00] Bitcoin is just in in simplistic terms
[04:04] if our money's purchasing power is
[04:06] increasing over time then that means as
[04:08] time goes by we have greater capacity to
[04:10] show up and if we have greater capacity
[04:12] to show up then we can more consciously
[04:13] think about the content we're consuming
[04:15] and so I think that people are going to
[04:18] be a lot more aware of the content
[04:20] they're consuming and formulating their
[04:22] opin their opinions and not only that I
[04:25] think that it makes for a world where
[04:28] people tend to align more more on truth
[04:31] and at the same time people given that
[04:33] they've formulated their opinions and
[04:34] they they understand the research
[04:36] they've they've done they're also
[04:37] opening to have they're open to having
[04:39] debates because they always say what is
[04:40] the famous saying it's like uh truth is
[04:43] open to being questioned lies cannot and
[04:45] so I think many times when we formulate
[04:47] our opinions off mainstream media when
[04:49] we haven't done the research ourselves
[04:51] the moment someone questions our belief
[04:52] and we cannot really articulate or
[04:54] explain it in the way that you want to
[04:55] be able to or to to the the ability to
[04:58] be able to really go deep all of a
[05:00] sudden our ego arises and we start to
[05:01] shut down the conversation and so I
[05:03] think that that's one of the challenges
[05:04] we find in society today is that people
[05:06] are working so hard the cost of living
[05:08] is so expensive that people feel stuck
[05:10] they can't necessarily go and spend as
[05:13] much time researching into the things
[05:14] they're passionate about to the extent
[05:16] that they may be able to onair bitcoin
[05:17] standard and so people have these these
[05:20] very strong opinions but they're not
[05:22] really based on anything and it's really
[05:24] hard to see this happen and there's
[05:25] there's a lot of divisiveness in
[05:27] society yeah it's I see it with Swiss
[05:31] because Swiss is so close to us and when
[05:34] when you hear Germans or other people
[05:37] that are close to Swiss talking about
[05:38] Swiss people they like it's a little bit
[05:40] slower in Swiss uh they're a little bit
[05:43] more um relaxed and and late back in in
[05:46] Swiss obviously not everybody but in
[05:49] general it it is true like you come to
[05:51] the Swiss country it's beautiful and and
[05:53] the you you notice that like they're the
[05:56] closest to the gold standard they they
[05:58] are the last ones who go off the gold
[06:00] standard which is uh really interesting
[06:02] for me to to see uh and it's kind of
[06:05] like what what happens when people get
[06:07] their time back with the family for
[06:09] research for everything uh and not
[06:13] living in this hectic world where like
[06:15] have to paycheck for paycheck and and
[06:17] you have to kind of make a living and
[06:18] then you have the second or third job
[06:20] and you try to to do it all uh and what
[06:23] happens when you can just actually like
[06:25] lay back and just read a book and
[06:28] actually read research or spend time
[06:30] with your family I think this is also I
[06:32] have a lot of compassions with people
[06:34] that don't get Bitcoin because all often
[06:36] times they just don't have a time to
[06:38] actually research about the topic they
[06:41] they having two jobs and they they don't
[06:43] like they don't have the time to
[06:45] research 100 or thousand hours which
[06:48] sometimes Bitcoin are say oh you need at
[06:50] least 100 hours to understand Bitcoin
[06:52] but most people don't have this at the
[06:54] time it's it's it's interesting you
[06:56] bring that up because I think that the
[06:58] way I like to think look at things is in
[07:00] in Psychology got maso's hierarchy of
[07:02] needs and on the base of our this
[07:04] pyramid of needs is our basic security
[07:07] needs we need food and we need shelter
[07:10] and it's very hard for us to start
[07:11] thinking about these upper needs such as
[07:13] like compassion and altruism or
[07:16] relationships or even getting up to
[07:18] self-actualization spiritual beliefs if
[07:21] we do not have our base needs met if we
[07:23] do not have our base needs met of of
[07:25] food and shelter then we kind of get
[07:26] stuck in this low level of just trying
[07:28] to fend for ourselves eles and I think
[07:30] that when I look at bitcoiners it really
[07:33] has blown my world view wide open
[07:36] because I think going into the pandemic
[07:38] I was very scared I felt like the world
[07:40] felt like a very dark place the world
[07:42] felt like the trajectory we were on is
[07:45] that increasingly people are just trying
[07:47] to meet their basic needs and people
[07:49] aren't they don't have the capacity to
[07:51] think for themselves they don't have the
[07:52] capacity to give back they don't have
[07:54] the capacity to support community and
[07:56] then you look at bitcoiners and
[07:57] bitcoiners having kids they're trying to
[07:59] what they can for the community they're
[08:00] having increased amount of time to U
[08:03] meet their own emotional needs their
[08:05] kids emotional needs societal needs uh
[08:08] as time goes by and I I think this is
[08:11] something that has really opened my eyes
[08:13] to seeing that we do have the potential
[08:15] for a Rosy future whereas only a handful
[08:17] of years ago I I thought the world was
[08:19] quite a dark place and so I think that
[08:21] it's so cool to see this cohort of
[08:23] individuals that are coming together but
[08:25] they're also seeing on a behavioral
[08:27] level that money is actually changing
[08:29] how they're showing up in the world
[08:30] which is
[08:31] profound is is that the I think you have
[08:34] the book uh the the hidden cost of money
[08:37] uh my first actual question for the
[08:39] podcast would be today uh what what is
[08:42] the the hidden cost of money and I guess
[08:43] there's like two answers to that like
[08:45] firstus like your book and and what is
[08:47] there but like you get that ask a lot I
[08:50] guess what like what is the hidden cost
[08:53] of money what are you describing in your
[08:54] book for sure so I ended up I I would
[08:58] say and
[08:59] it's I'm trying to just uh figure out
[09:02] how far back do I want to go I I I'll
[09:03] just start with the book I ended up
[09:05] basically recognizing that uh when I
[09:08] enter the Bitcoin space and I would say
[09:10] I really went deep down the rabbit hole
[09:12] in 2020 I've being interested in Bitcoin
[09:14] and watching all the documentaries you
[09:15] name it but I hadn't really gone down
[09:17] the rabbit hole and grasp the
[09:18] significance of Bitcoin until about 2020
[09:21] and so in the last kind of four to five
[09:22] years it really has sunk in as to the
[09:25] importance of money I think a lot of us
[09:27] see money as just this medium of
[09:28] Exchange this thing we exchange back and
[09:30] forth to be able to go buy groceries to
[09:32] go buy a car to be able to pay for our
[09:34] rent but we don't think about what are
[09:36] the costs of money if we have a money
[09:38] that doesn't meet societal needs it
[09:40] doesn't meet the user's needs what are
[09:42] the costs of this and so going down this
[09:45] Bitcoin Rabbit Hole I felt as if there
[09:47] were many books that described uh the
[09:49] technical aspects if you want to go and
[09:51] read Antonopoulos if you wanted to go
[09:52] into the the philosophical you can go
[09:55] read breed love if the corporate you've
[09:56] got sailor and you you do have saf books
[10:00] which I think start to touch on some of
[10:01] these subjects but they approach it
[10:03] quite academically and so I really like
[10:05] to try and speak to the lay person as to
[10:08] how money weaves its influence into all
[10:10] of these aspects of our society so how
[10:12] does it impact how I show up as an
[10:14] individual and my behavior how does it
[10:15] impact the environment how does it
[10:17] impact politics how does it impact
[10:19] businesses and so ultimately the whole
[10:21] goal of the Hidden cost of money was to
[10:23] break down this thing called money to
[10:25] really show individuals that money is
[10:27] incredibly important in society not so
[10:29] much in that we can buy and sell and buy
[10:31] the things we need to but in that when a
[10:33] money is broken it shapes society and it
[10:35] shapes Society in very negative ways
[10:38] when a money meets our needs it shapes
[10:40] Society in positive ways and so being
[10:43] able to see how different types of money
[10:45] can shape Society in in different ways
[10:47] is is incredibly important and that's
[10:49] where ultimately ends on bitcoin and
[10:51] what a world underneath a Bitcoin
[10:53] standard may look like because I think
[10:56] when you really go down the Bitcoin
[10:57] rabbit hole that's when you start
[10:59] recognizing my God this thing has the
[11:01] potential to change how we show up in
[11:03] life it gives us greater capacity to
[11:05] look inwards and ask the questions like
[11:07] who am I and how do I want to show up
[11:09] because I think unfortunately in today's
[11:11] world because money is losing purchasing
[11:13] power because our cost of living is
[11:14] rising and it's getting harder and
[11:16] harder to get ahead people increasingly
[11:18] are losing their authenticity they don't
[11:20] know who they are how they want to show
[11:22] up and I think that's a problem we're
[11:24] losing our our ability to show up
[11:26] authentically in society
[11:29] this uh Bitcoin world uh in the end of
[11:32] the day when everything is deflationary
[11:34] we're getting better in producing stuff
[11:36] and we have sound money that uh kind of
[11:38] enables everything uh lead to a world
[11:41] where we have an abundant system where
[11:43] we have like this uh we can actually
[11:46] build on top of what we already have
[11:49] built and we can concentrate on on
[11:51] bigger things I'm also thinking a lot
[11:53] about zombie companies right now I feel
[11:56] like this money printing enables a lot
[11:57] of um empty companies that don't do
[12:01] actually a lot or even in companies that
[12:03] do something there's like 10% of people
[12:06] that actually do something in 90% of
[12:08] people that are just there and I saw
[12:10] that in the corporate world where I I
[12:12] worked before that uh how do you how do
[12:16] you see that it's interesting because
[12:18] you can kind of look at it from two
[12:19] different perspectives the way that I
[12:20] see it the first perspective is and and
[12:23] to your question which is um do you see
[12:25] under a Bitcoin World kind of this
[12:26] abundance and the first perspective is
[12:29] that I think unfortunately in our world
[12:31] today because money is losing value we
[12:34] are incentivized to consume given that
[12:36] our purchasing power is greatest in this
[12:37] present moment so we have the society
[12:39] where we have a very consumer society
[12:41] and you see it across social media
[12:43] people are always trying to buy the next
[12:44] greatest thing the newest iPhone the the
[12:47] the newest Niks they want to look uh
[12:50] they want to look the part they want to
[12:51] fit in with Society they want to conform
[12:54] and so the challenge is we have a
[12:56] society that unfortunately has shifted
[12:57] our view on what we believe happiness is
[13:00] happiness we believe is this external
[13:02] thing where if I go and purchase these
[13:03] things if I go and purchase these shoes
[13:05] if I go and get the nice car then I'm
[13:07] going to be happy but it's very fleeting
[13:09] unfortunately when we go and purchase
[13:10] something that's not happiness happiness
[13:12] is something when we contribute to
[13:14] society when we challenge ourselves when
[13:16] we connect with others we build
[13:18] relationships and so what I think is
[13:19] interesting on a Bitcoin standard is
[13:22] that when our money is worth more over
[13:24] time all of a sudden it shifts and
[13:26] Bitcoin is will know this term it shifts
[13:28] our time preference
[13:29] it shifts our ability to start thinking
[13:31] long term given that our purchasing
[13:33] power is worth more in the future we
[13:34] start to think about Prosperity we start
[13:36] to think about security we start to
[13:38] think about the future that gives us a
[13:40] greater capacity to think okay if I'm
[13:42] thinking about the future how do I want
[13:43] to show up and so what ends up happening
[13:45] I believe on a Bitcoin standard is that
[13:48] when we talk about abundance I think we
[13:50] have abundance in that we have greater
[13:52] time to meet our internal needs and so
[13:55] we have greater abundance and happiness
[13:57] and joy not because we're per purchasing
[13:59] consumer goods but because we have
[14:01] greater capacity to contribute with
[14:03] Society to challenge ourselves to build
[14:05] relationships and that abundance and
[14:07] happiness is huge and then secondly you
[14:09] can also look at it kind of from maybe
[14:11] how most people approach it which is
[14:13] that unfortunately today we've got so
[14:16] much inefficiency in society when money
[14:18] is losing value over time everyone is
[14:21] just trying to get what they can
[14:22] businesses are trying to get as much
[14:24] grants they're trying to get subsidies
[14:25] they're trying to basically just grow as
[14:27] quickly as possible against the system
[14:29] that's slowly imploding in on itself and
[14:31] so I think that we have a lot of
[14:33] inefficiency we have a lot of wastage
[14:36] when you look at the government the
[14:37] government given that it's got a money
[14:39] printer it can pay above average wages
[14:42] so the in in the us alone the average
[14:45] public job pays 10% more than the
[14:47] private sector job so over time the the
[14:50] government is slowly engulfing the
[14:51] private sector but the government
[14:53] doesn't have any incentive to be
[14:54] fiscally responsible given that it's got
[14:56] a money printer it's not really
[14:57] competing on a free market basis basis
[14:59] and so we've got this very inefficient
[15:01] cumbersome system that is we don't
[15:04] really have abundance it's getting
[15:06] harder and harder and harder to get by
[15:07] we're seeing massive wealth inequality
[15:09] house prices are skyrocketing and
[15:12] because of this people are struggling
[15:14] whereas I think on a Bitcoin standard
[15:16] and as most bitcoiners uh would tend to
[15:18] agree is that if we've got purchasing
[15:20] power that's increasing over time we
[15:22] have greater capacity to show up and
[15:24] meet our own personal needs but not only
[15:26] that and this is something that I think
[15:28] is so incredibly in like like motivating
[15:32] is that when we have a money that acts
[15:34] as a store of value all of a sudden
[15:36] we're incentivized to save again and if
[15:38] we're incentivized to save again what's
[15:40] going to happen all of a sudden money
[15:42] isn't just going to go flood into all of
[15:44] these other investment uh vehicles to
[15:46] try and Escape debasement it's not going
[15:48] to flood into real estate it's not going
[15:49] to go flood into equities it's not going
[15:51] to flood into the bond market so we'd
[15:53] see trillions of dollars exit those
[15:55] traditional asset types back into the
[15:57] currency given that we can simply just
[15:59] saving the currency and if we can simply
[16:01] just saving the currency what ends up
[16:03] happening is our cost of living is
[16:04] cheaper not only because of as
[16:06] technology advances as efficiency
[16:08] increases as productivity uh increases
[16:11] uh we see costs fall but also because at
[16:14] the moment house prices are elevated
[16:15] because people are just trying to flee
[16:16] the currency if people are able to
[16:18] Simply Save in the currency house prices
[16:20] be a hell of a lot cheaper and so I
[16:21] think that life becomes easier life
[16:24] becomes more abundant simply because our
[16:26] cost of living our our ability to Pur
[16:28] purchases things allow us to thrive will
[16:31] be cheaper and that that I think is an
[16:32] incredible future to live in a mentioned
[16:36] the government and I'm a a lot thinking
[16:40] about that what do you imagine the role
[16:43] of government or centralized
[16:46] organizations like a government uh a lot
[16:49] of people a lot of Bitcoin say also like
[16:51] it could be optional and but we have
[16:54] maybe a centralized organization where
[16:56] you can pay uh them to make make the
[16:59] streets to make hospitals whatever but
[17:01] it's an optional service and if you
[17:03] really want to go on the streets then
[17:04] you have to pay for that how do you see
[17:06] like on a on a Bitcoin standard on on a
[17:09] sound money standards the role of
[17:11] government it's interesting I think
[17:13] there's many bitcoiners that look at
[17:15] this very differently uh some of them
[17:16] are more anaco capitalists they don't
[17:18] necessarily believe there is a role for
[17:20] government and that we don't need a
[17:21] government and that a free market has
[17:24] the ability to self-organize and I think
[17:27] the free market has the ability to self
[17:29] organized to a certain extent but I'm
[17:31] not so sure I I tend to lean towards
[17:34] there is a role for government but
[17:36] government right now is far too
[17:38] cumbersome far too big and given that
[17:40] government has a money printer it can
[17:42] fund operations without support from the
[17:44] populous and so I think the way that I
[17:46] Envision it is that first off if we were
[17:49] living on a Bitcoin standard we would
[17:51] have separated money from state that
[17:53] means that the state or the government
[17:55] has to compete like any other business
[17:57] if the government itself is not fiscally
[17:59] responsible then it's going to wither
[18:01] away because it's not going to be able
[18:02] to service its debt obligations it's not
[18:04] going to service it it employee wages
[18:06] you name it and so it's going to quickly
[18:07] wither away and that allows another
[18:09] government that offers value that
[18:11] listens to the populace to rise up and
[18:13] that's how a free market has been
[18:15] operating uh since the dawn of time if
[18:17] you've got one company and they've got
[18:19] the or if you've got two companies and
[18:20] they're they're creating the same
[18:21] product and one is offering a better
[18:23] product then what will happen is that
[18:24] product will that company will rise up
[18:26] and the other one will wither away we
[18:28] don't allow that to happen in an
[18:34] interventionism to certain companies and
[18:36] so we ultimately distort this free
[18:39] market and it's the same thing with
[18:40] government when you have a money printer
[18:42] that money printer allows the government
[18:44] as I mentioned to fund operations
[18:46] without support from the populace so we
[18:47] find ourselves in these societies that
[18:50] unfortunately don't really meet the
[18:51] needs of the populace so I think what
[18:53] will happen under a Bitcoin standard is
[18:55] that if a government is not being
[18:57] fiscally responsible it has a potential
[18:59] to wither away but not only that if the
[19:01] populists do not agree with what the
[19:03] government is doing if they were to
[19:05] simply just like withhold paying taxes
[19:07] the government also cannot fund itself
[19:09] and this is incredibly important I think
[19:10] about it in terms of War at the moment
[19:13] unfortunately I do not support War as an
[19:16] individual but the government given that
[19:18] it can devalue the currency it can then
[19:21] go and fund War at my expense as a
[19:23] currency holder regardless of whether or
[19:25] not I support war and so on the grand
[19:27] scheme of things you look at at a
[19:29] country and it says hey look this
[19:30] country is spending a lot of money on
[19:32] war that must mean the populist supports
[19:33] War but that's not the case on a Bitcoin
[19:36] standard if the populists do not support
[19:37] war and they withhold paying taxes that
[19:40] government can no longer go and fund
[19:42] Wars and that government will quickly
[19:44] wither away and another one will rise up
[19:45] and so I think that it flips the
[19:47] incentives in society not only that and
[19:49] I'll add one more point which is with
[19:52] Bitcoin it's the first time in history
[19:55] we've ever had what's called like a non
[19:57] jurisdictionally based asset which I
[19:59] mean which what that means is basically
[20:02] every other asset is either tangible
[20:04] like real estate it is physically
[20:06] located that means that it can be seized
[20:08] quite easily or it is digital if you're
[20:11] holding cash in the bank if you're
[20:12] holding equities if you're holding bonds
[20:14] they're digital but they're held by a
[20:16] third party which again means that the
[20:17] government can seize those assets quite
[20:19] easily when it comes to bitcoin it is
[20:21] digital but it's non jurisdictionally
[20:23] based and we can take custody of that
[20:25] that asset ourselves so it's not really
[20:26] existing in any jurisdiction it's just
[20:28] in the digital realm of things and that
[20:30] means that value can now flow to where
[20:32] value is being created if my government
[20:35] is not offering a favorable jurisdiction
[20:37] for me to live in I can walk across a
[20:39] border Stark naked with 12 to 24 words
[20:42] in my head and the government has no
[20:44] idea that I'm moving my value with me
[20:47] and so if money and and value can
[20:49] effectively move to where value is being
[20:50] created then it incentivizes value
[20:53] creation it incentivizes governments if
[20:55] they cannot seize that that Capital
[20:57] easily well then what do they have to to
[20:58] do they have to offer value so they have
[21:00] to change the way they're approaching
[21:02] their populace and that is profound and
[21:03] we're seeing that already with with
[21:05] countries like El Salvador we're seeing
[21:07] that with countries are adopting Bitcoin
[21:09] and showing a favorable jurisdiction
[21:11] because capital is Flowing towards them
[21:13] and I think in time this will start to
[21:15] play a big role in how we see these
[21:17] larger Nation States changing their
[21:19] behavior because if they can't take
[21:21] things by force well then they have to
[21:23] offer
[21:24] value and I think the in in this uh
[21:29] even like money is the one part like if
[21:32] you can take your money wherever you
[21:33] want to go and deploy your Capital
[21:36] wherever you want to go but there's
[21:37] another part to it which is like the
[21:39] second big revolution where we kind of
[21:41] in with the internet Revolution uh where
[21:44] all of the sudden there are remote jobs
[21:46] there like we can do the podcast
[21:48] remotely which was not in that quality
[21:50] possible just like a 10 20 years ago so
[21:54] like even from a work perspective uh and
[21:58] then also from from a capital
[21:59] perspective this kind of eliminates the
[22:02] those those borers because people can
[22:04] just like live anywhere like I'm now
[22:06] kind of working online only I'm doing a
[22:09] lot of physical stuff but all the things
[22:12] I do in Austria I can easily just start
[22:14] in any country where there are other
[22:17] bitcoiners so that's like pretty easy
[22:19] for me to do and they're like major
[22:22] other examples of that is do you see a
[22:24] future where like those those those
[22:26] borders where we like oh that's Austria
[22:29] that's America that's Australia that's
[22:31] Canada like those those borders are
[22:35] either getting bigger and to a bigger
[22:38] extent or like maybe even like more
[22:40] localized or completely
[22:43] deiminated this is a tough one and I
[22:45] think it can go many different ways um
[22:48] it's interesting last October I went to
[22:50] prospera in Honduras and prosper is a
[22:53] special economic zone and for those that
[22:54] aren't familiar with a special economic
[22:56] zone it's basically you can think of it
[22:58] as a jurisdiction with inside inside of
[23:00] like a host country and so prospers
[23:02] inside of Honduras but it has its own it
[23:06] can basically control its borders to a
[23:08] certain extent as long as it abides by
[23:11] the criminal code and so it doesn't have
[23:13] to follow the same taxation profile as
[23:15] Honduras it can kind of do what it wants
[23:16] inside its borders as long as it abides
[23:18] by the criminal code and that gives it a
[23:20] lot of autonomy to basically create a
[23:23] favorable location to draw uh
[23:25] entrepreneurs in and it was amazing to
[23:28] go to Honduras because all of a sudden
[23:30] they are Bitcoin is their currency you
[23:32] can go to any of the shops inside of um
[23:35] Prosper you can pay with Bitcoin but
[23:37] you're also seeing Prosper influence
[23:39] it's on the island of ratan and you're
[23:41] also seeing prospera INF influence a lot
[23:43] of the surrounding area outside of um
[23:45] prospera and that's interesting because
[23:47] you're seeing local communities
[23:49] recognize that hey Bitcoin is incredibly
[23:51] powerful more so than the Honduran local
[23:53] currency so we're going to start
[23:55] accepting Bitcoin and so what I think
[23:57] will happen in time is I think these
[23:59] borders will still exist but the borders
[24:01] won't be as confining as they have been
[24:05] up until now and I also think that
[24:08] you're going to see much smaller uh
[24:10] localities and much smaller
[24:11] jurisdictions that have their own rules
[24:13] and regulations whereby it's a more
[24:15] optional opin system and I think this is
[24:18] where you kind of get this mix of a um
[24:22] anaco capitalist with kind of a
[24:24] democratic State whereby the anaco
[24:26] capitalists believe that okay if you've
[24:29] got a pure free market then ultimately
[24:31] it could end up like Mad Max so we're
[24:33] going to create these more favorable
[24:35] jurisdictions but the jurisdictions have
[24:36] a set of rules and so if you want to
[24:38] come into our jurisdictions you got to
[24:39] play by our rules and so I think that
[24:41] that is the potential to happen you have
[24:43] these small localities that say look if
[24:45] you want to come into our small little
[24:46] locality live in our little location
[24:49] well then you're going to pay this
[24:50] amount of a fee in order to be able to
[24:52] maintain the roads pay for police pay
[24:54] for infrastructure you name it and at
[24:56] the same time this is going to be uh
[24:58] rules and regulations with inside this
[25:00] jurisdiction but it's an opt-in system
[25:01] as opposed to a uh a system based upon
[25:05] Force which is our current taxation
[25:06] system so it's it's a tough one because
[25:09] I think it can go many different ways
[25:10] but I see the borders will be less
[25:12] controlled as they are now whereas we're
[25:14] going to have a lot more of these
[25:15] smaller little jurisdictions inside of
[25:17] these larger host
[25:18] States and I think uh you you mentioned
[25:21] it it needs rules to a certain extent
[25:24] like we as as as as we're living in a
[25:27] society we kind of like need um um to
[25:31] certain extent I try to compare it
[25:33] always with soccer because it's right
[25:36] now in the the European championship and
[25:38] everything but uh in in soccer you also
[25:41] have like when someone steps out of the
[25:43] boundaries too much they get a fine they
[25:46] maybe cannot uh play anymore in the game
[25:48] they maybe even get a fine so they
[25:50] cannot play in like the following games
[25:53] uh when they do something really rude or
[25:56] like really like endanger inuring other
[25:59] players uh and to certain extent we we
[26:02] need those those kind of boundaries and
[26:04] and and rules in in society so that we
[26:07] don't end up in a mess and don't end up
[26:09] in a chaos the only question is like how
[26:11] do we uh enforce those rules and how can
[26:14] we uh make sure those rules uh and and
[26:18] those cont and this Monopoly on on on
[26:20] violence that we then kind of agree on
[26:23] uh is not um how do you say um obscured
[26:26] or like I forgot word of English like
[26:29] it's like when it does not get uh uh the
[26:33] wrong person is not getting to this
[26:35] power and then uh getting to this power
[26:39] and and uh I forgot this English word
[26:41] sorry no don't worry I I I I I I grasp
[26:45] what you're trying to say and I think
[26:46] that what is interesting is that rules
[26:48] are necessary and I believe that I'm
[26:52] fortunately the world that we live in is
[26:54] is one in which people like to think of
[26:57] things in black and white so you're
[26:59] either for intervention or you're
[27:00] against intervention and there's nothing
[27:02] in between whereas I think I'm for the
[27:05] way I view things is that it's a
[27:07] spectrum at the moment we have way too
[27:09] much intervention I think we can do with
[27:11] way less intervention but zero
[27:13] intervention is also not necessarily
[27:15] possible and I think that intervention
[27:18] is something that happens in our
[27:20] day-to-day lives we're intervening in
[27:21] each other's lives and so what is
[27:23] intervention and the way that I think
[27:24] about it sometimes on a grander scale is
[27:27] if you were to separate money from State
[27:29] it's not as if the government cannot
[27:31] have a welfare state or it cannot
[27:33] intervene when we go into a recession
[27:35] but what it does mean is that if the
[27:37] government wants to intervene if we're
[27:39] going into a recession what ends up
[27:41] happening is first it has to save before
[27:43] that recession it has to be fiscally
[27:44] responsible and then when we go through
[27:46] a tough time it is limited in its
[27:49] capacity to intervene given it can only
[27:51] intervene up until the point at which it
[27:52] has saved Capital to intervene and that
[27:54] means that it limits the ability for the
[27:57] government to basically change the
[27:58] natural order of things and so when I
[28:01] think about it in terms of what does a
[28:03] future look like on a Bitcoin standard
[28:05] rules are good intervention on its own
[28:08] is is is not bad or good it's just
[28:11] what's the word it's aoral it's not bad
[28:13] or good it's just something and so
[28:15] sometimes intervention can be good
[28:17] sometimes intervention can be bad and so
[28:19] I think that in these smaller little
[28:21] jurisdictions what will happen is it's
[28:24] not like our current system as I
[28:25] mentioned whereby if you do not pay
[28:27] taxes or you do not follow the rules and
[28:29] you're going to be put in prison or
[28:30] you're going to face a hefty fine
[28:31] instead under these jurisdictions it's
[28:33] going to be an opt-in system where look
[28:35] you can live in this jurisdiction as
[28:37] long as you follow the rules if you
[28:38] don't follow the rules then you can go
[28:39] live somewhere else and so given that
[28:41] it's opt in is optional it abides more
[28:43] by this whole free market libertarian
[28:45] idea which is that you do not force your
[28:47] beliefs on other people you do not uh
[28:50] interact you do not change someone's
[28:52] kind of trajectory based upon your will
[28:55] uh it's optional and so I think that
[28:56] that is incredibly important an opt-in
[28:58] system as opposed to a system built upon
[29:01] force and
[29:02] seizure I mean some make the argument
[29:05] even that we are already to a certain
[29:08] extent in this an opin system because I
[29:11] can go ahead and like now it needs
[29:14] Capital it needs skill it needs uh like
[29:17] the the barriers are still high but I
[29:20] can go out of Austria I can live in El
[29:22] Salvador I can can live in in America I
[29:24] mean America is is is interesting
[29:26] because when you go out of America you
[29:28] have an exit tax and you you get tax all
[29:31] around the world which I find very
[29:33] frustrating but I'm not American so I
[29:35] don't care about that but but it's it's
[29:38] kind of already like an an an an opt-in
[29:41] system how do you
[29:43] like what's next like like we already
[29:46] have like this kind of opin system uh is
[29:49] this opin system then more on a digital
[29:50] realm where we like we can live in uh
[29:53] Austria but have different nations that
[29:56] we can adopt to like the I think Michael
[29:58] Anon fiser the author of uh Bitcoin
[30:01] Nations kind of had this uh this Vision
[30:05] written in his book where like it
[30:07] doesn't matter where you live you can
[30:08] like uh subscribe to your to your
[30:12] country of of will uh or is that's too
[30:15] much Utopia it's it's actually uh what
[30:18] is it the I think his name is bellagi uh
[30:21] and he talks about the network State and
[30:23] how we're kind of trending towards which
[30:24] I think he has read quite a bit about
[30:26] and and Tom Fisher I believe from my
[30:27] understand standing talks a lot about
[30:29] the network State and how as the digital
[30:31] economy is advancing we're kind of
[30:33] forming these communities not based on
[30:35] physical local but instead these digital
[30:37] locals you could say the Bitcoin
[30:39] community in a sense is its own little
[30:40] Nation we have our own beliefs and uh
[30:44] it's interesting I still very much think
[30:46] that we're still physical in nature I I
[30:49] I think that we have got too far away
[30:51] from uh the Physical Realm and
[30:55] unfortunately we have people in is
[30:58] dictating what is deemed uh good for the
[31:01] environment what is deemed bad for the
[31:03] environment yet they themselves are
[31:04] sitting on computers in the digital
[31:06] realm and then Farmers being told
[31:07] they're not allowed to farm when they're
[31:08] the ones providing food for society and
[31:10] so I lean more towards if I could not
[31:12] use social media if I didn't have to use
[31:14] social media for the rest of my life it
[31:16] wouldn't really phase me like I I I live
[31:18] in the mountains I would love to spend
[31:19] more time on the land and more time in
[31:21] nature and so I still very much believe
[31:23] that uh we we'll predominantly spend
[31:27] most of our life in the Physical Realm
[31:29] even though increasingly our cognitive
[31:31] capacity is spent in the digital realm
[31:32] and because of that I think physical
[31:34] borders are still going to exist for
[31:35] quite some time um and then to your
[31:38] point I think that we do live in a
[31:40] partially uh optional environment
[31:43] partially optional in that the place at
[31:45] which we're born does have immense kind
[31:47] of control over our future and our our
[31:51] ability to move and so if I want to go
[31:53] move to another country there's although
[31:56] it is optional to ass certain extent
[31:58] it's very hard for many people it's very
[32:00] hard for them to leave their country
[32:02] depending on which country you're born
[32:03] if you're born in certain third world
[32:05] countries it's nearly impossible for you
[32:06] to get visas and move into other
[32:08] countries and even if you're living in a
[32:09] western country for you to move it's
[32:11] very costly it's very expensive and so I
[32:13] think that unfortunately with the Fiat
[32:15] system it's allowed for these huge
[32:17] monopolies on control to take place so
[32:19] you've got a a government controlling a
[32:22] very large jurisdiction whereas I think
[32:24] in a more free market environment the
[32:26] government will still exist and there
[32:27] will be some overarching rules set by
[32:29] the government but I think we're going
[32:30] to have a lot more of these smaller
[32:31] jurisdictions with inside these bigger
[32:33] jurisdictions so it gives us more
[32:35] optionality even with inside our country
[32:37] within Canada I may be able to move uh
[32:40] five hours North into a smaller
[32:41] jurisdiction which is a community that
[32:43] very much more aligns with my values and
[32:46] so I think that's the way that I see
[32:48] things in the future but again it's
[32:49] something that I haven't I haven't gone
[32:52] deep down this Rabbit Hole I wouldn't
[32:53] necessarily say it's my area of
[32:54] expertise I spend a lot more time in the
[32:57] educational space given that my
[32:59] background is I've been a man and bike
[33:01] instructor a Backcountry man and bike
[33:03] instructor spending most of my time
[33:04] teaching for the last kind of 10 to 15
[33:06] years and I've absolutely loved helping
[33:09] people in their educational Journey
[33:11] learn skills and my passion is always
[33:14] kind of distilling down complex
[33:17] biomechanical movements into their
[33:18] simplest form and I've now taken that
[33:20] from man and biking and moved it over to
[33:22] finance and Bitcoin taking these like
[33:24] complex macroeconomic Financial subjects
[33:27] and Distilling it into a simplest form
[33:28] so that people ultimately can feel like
[33:31] hey I've got more control over my future
[33:33] I can better understand which steps to
[33:35] take that maybe will help improve my Pro
[33:38] ability to prosper and support my family
[33:40] and you name it and so I would say that
[33:42] my area of expertise tends to be more in
[33:44] the realm of Education than it does in
[33:46] envisioning these wild Futures but I
[33:48] always think it's interesting having
[33:50] that
[33:51] discussion what instructor are you like
[33:53] I did not understand the word maybe I'm
[33:55] I'm Laing English skills here oh um like
[33:58] mountain biking so like mountain biking
[34:01] mountain biking sorry the accent cool so
[34:03] like you you're teaching people how to
[34:06] uh get get downhill from the mountain on
[34:09] uphill yeah yeah I do I do a mixture of
[34:12] uphill and well I used to I I don't
[34:13] anymore I haven't for quite some time
[34:15] but I used to teach a mixture of in the
[34:18] where I live Whistler the little ski
[34:19] town that I live in in the summertime
[34:21] well I should say little it's it's a
[34:23] it's a world-class Resort it's an
[34:24] incredible Resort and I feel so honored
[34:26] to live here and um in the summertime it
[34:29] is the largest bik park in the world and
[34:31] in the winter time it's one of the
[34:32] largest ski resorts in the world and so
[34:34] I started teaching here when I was in my
[34:37] teenage years and I just absolutely
[34:39] loved it like I loved being able to
[34:41] support people and get them outdoors I
[34:43] think that going back to that point
[34:44] about kind of the digital world versus
[34:46] the physical world I think that the
[34:48] world is trending more and more towards
[34:50] this digital realm but this digital
[34:52] realm is not making people happy we've
[34:54] got highest rates of depression and
[34:56] anxiety and people having mind migraines
[34:58] they're staring at screens their
[34:59] eyesight is dropping off when you bring
[35:01] people out into the physical world you
[35:02] get them in nature you get in the forest
[35:04] you see that you see the animals and you
[35:07] get them moving their body there's
[35:09] nothing that beats it I think it's one
[35:11] of the best things to do thank you you
[35:13] already made it halfway through the
[35:14] video and I'm really really grateful to
[35:16] have you here two things make this
[35:19] channel possible you as a watcher and
[35:21] listener who keep supporting this
[35:23] Channel and another one is all the
[35:25] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[35:27] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[35:30] very start and where I personally buy my
[35:32] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[35:34] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[35:36] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[35:39] simplest and securest way to secure your
[35:43] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[35:45] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[35:48] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[35:50] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[35:53] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[35:56] and you know your friend does not have
[35:58] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[35:59] he needs a birthday present and a small
[36:02] life Heck if you use code Robin you get
[36:04] 5% off your order plus you support my
[36:07] channel and now let's get back to the
[36:09] video it's fascinating you see that so
[36:11] many bitcoiners that I also see they
[36:14] like let's get out let's have Sun let's
[36:17] have mountains let's have uh the ocean
[36:19] let's have something in the physical
[36:21] world and this is like this this this
[36:24] Digital
[36:25] World almost incentivizes you to get out
[36:28] and and do something I think like a lot
[36:31] of those advantages of of having Bitcoin
[36:34] are coming now because we are in an
[36:36] really early special kind of a group we
[36:39] are critical thinkers we are early
[36:40] adopters and uh the the
[36:44] 54th uh percent of of uh the world that
[36:48] is adopting Bitcoin is will not have the
[36:50] same effects that the the first like
[36:52] three 4% have because it's like a you're
[36:55] in a different kind of group and I think
[36:57] a lot of those complete lifechanging
[36:59] experience that that people have and
[37:01] even like reported here on the on the
[37:03] podcast a lot I come because all of the
[37:06] sudden their environment changes they're
[37:08] like getting out of the normal
[37:09] environment and all of the sudden they
[37:11] are coming to this Bitcoin meetups so
[37:13] this Bitcoin conferences and they are
[37:15] changing uh the people around each other
[37:18] but even more than that there is also
[37:21] the the monetary aspect where you all of
[37:23] the sudden you look out in the future
[37:25] because you have a sound money it
[37:26] creates a solid Foundation I often make
[37:29] this example of like running in in a
[37:31] sand and mud uh where it's like the fear
[37:34] system where you like kind of drag down
[37:36] every time you make a step but you still
[37:39] come forward uh but on the other hand
[37:42] there's a solid Street where you can run
[37:43] on like a Bitcoin standard you still
[37:46] have to run like on a Bitcoin standard
[37:47] you just like you cannot just like do
[37:49] nothing because this proof of work
[37:51] concept you still have to run and I love
[37:53] that kind of an example and I'm I'm I'm
[37:55] really loving always the conversations
[37:57] like what is possible on on that solid
[38:00] Street versus on the on the M like what
[38:02] what more can can Society do like what
[38:05] what else is like are we uh civilizing
[38:08] other planets are we what what are what
[38:10] are we up to well and it's interesting
[38:13] you kind of bring up that point which is
[38:15] I think that unfortunately when our
[38:17] money doesn't act as a store of value
[38:19] everyone is constantly trying to flee
[38:21] the money to go and invest and there's a
[38:23] big difference as I mentioned previously
[38:25] between saving and investing in a world
[38:28] where we are always striving to get more
[38:30] for less as Jeff Booth always talks
[38:32] about we live in this kind of
[38:33] deflationary world where prices should
[38:35] be falling we're always striving to get
[38:37] more for less and you can give so many
[38:38] examples like one that I always like to
[38:41] think about is like apples if you think
[38:42] about an apple 200 years ago to bring an
[38:45] apple to Market you would have to have
[38:47] some guy on his little farm hand kind of
[38:50] till the soil then he would have to
[38:51] plant the seeds and then he would have
[38:52] to uh protect his crop and let it grow
[38:55] and then at the same time he'd also have
[38:57] to he didn't have fertilizer he didn't
[38:59] have any really heavy machinery he would
[39:01] then have to go and handpick all of this
[39:02] crop he would then have to horse and
[39:04] cart all the way to the market and then
[39:06] go and sell his apples now you've got
[39:08] green houses you can grow year round
[39:10] you've got fertilizers you've got
[39:11] genetically modified seeds to maximize
[39:13] crop growth you've got all of this
[39:15] Machinery to be able to remove the
[39:17] individual and to be able to harvest
[39:18] thousands of crop in very short amounts
[39:21] of time and then you've got uh you've
[39:23] got tankers you've got uh ships you've
[39:26] got you name it to be able to move this
[39:27] move the apples to kind of the the end
[39:30] consumer and what we should see is
[39:32] because of this obviously advancement te
[39:34] technology prices should fall but
[39:36] instead over the last 100 years Apple
[39:38] prices have gone up 5,480 per. that's
[39:41] just mind-blowing that's not
[39:43] representing the reality of the world in
[39:45] which we live in and so I think that um
[39:48] the world we live in should be one where
[39:50] prices fall as technology advances as
[39:52] productivity increases as efficiency
[39:54] increases and because we do not
[39:57] experienced that because prices are
[39:58] rising because of monetary intervention
[40:00] because of uh monetary intervention
[40:02] causing inflation we're now pushed into
[40:05] investing and so by being pushed into
[40:07] investing and we're unable to simply
[40:09] just save in the currency well all of
[40:11] this time and energy is spent on
[40:12] thinking about money all of this time
[40:14] and energy is spent on what can I do
[40:16] with my money in order to maximize my
[40:18] ability to make more money and that
[40:21] might that all of that time and energy
[40:23] and we're talking about a whole industry
[40:24] the whole financial sector is built
[40:26] around trying to to make more money in a
[40:28] free market I would argue that it would
[40:30] barely exist because people would be
[40:32] able to just save in the currency and if
[40:34] that whole Market did not exist well
[40:37] those people would be doing other things
[40:38] they would be thinking about how do we
[40:40] add value to society how do I create a
[40:42] business that offers value to society
[40:44] how do I add think about like Ingenuity
[40:46] and Innovation what can I do in order to
[40:48] add value to society and so I think that
[40:50] the world we would live in would be a
[40:51] much more prosperous world where we' be
[40:53] benefiting so much of our time is
[40:55] artificially spent on just trying to
[40:57] freaking invest trying to protect our
[40:59] money and that doesn't it shouldn't
[41:01] matter we should be able to Simply Save
[41:03] and benefit from Human Ingenuity human
[41:07] advancement it's it's I never saw it
[41:09] like that actually like the financial
[41:11] Market is kind of the the biggest zombie
[41:14] Market ever because like so many so much
[41:17] time is spent on like analyzing some
[41:19] charts analyzing like oh what is what
[41:21] that happens what what if like the
[41:23] industry and like it's it's I wasn't
[41:25] that World um before I was in the stock
[41:28] world and I was hearing like what
[41:30] they're doing and what this influence on
[41:32] the stocks is and the bad thing is like
[41:36] if if you're actually in this world deep
[41:38] and you understand what's going on you
[41:39] can actually make money from that and
[41:41] that's why a lot of people do it and
[41:43] that's a sad part of it that it's
[41:44] actually pays off to do that uh and it
[41:47] would be so much better if if people
[41:49] used their time to just like Take One
[41:53] Financial energy saor like Bitcoin uh
[41:56] and then uh what whatever they have like
[41:58] they they do have their 24 hours they
[42:00] have to sleep they have to eat they have
[42:03] to spend time with the family and the
[42:04] rest of the time where they have uh the
[42:07] the mental capacity to work and be
[42:09] creative and and and and do something
[42:11] for the productive for the world when
[42:14] this is not spent on analyzing some
[42:16] weird lines on a computer it would be
[42:19] really good like like this this would
[42:21] enable the society to really uh come
[42:24] come a long way in my question is always
[42:27] like why do not more people get it oh
[42:31] manart and I think that unfortunately
[42:34] it's one of those things where it's very
[42:36] hard for people to change their beliefs
[42:40] and I I'll give my mom for example going
[42:42] into the pandemic I think I started to
[42:46] explain to her how our monetary system
[42:48] is influencing all these other areas of
[42:50] society and she was like no no no the
[42:52] the current system is totally fine like
[42:53] the government has our best interests at
[42:55] heart and then as you start to show them
[42:57] more and more evidence they would the
[43:00] walls would keep going up and I feel
[43:02] lucky that my mom ended up coming out I
[43:04] think it was in 20120 in like August of
[43:06] 2020 came out to Canada and I just said
[43:09] look sit down with me for like two hours
[43:11] I'm going to show you some charts and if
[43:13] you still don't believe anything is
[43:15] happening the monetary system isn't
[43:16] broken then we can just we can we cannot
[43:18] talk about it she was like okay fine
[43:19] I'll sit down and after that two hours I
[43:21] showed her a few charts and she was just
[43:23] like my God this is mindblowing and that
[43:27] shift allowed her to kind of break down
[43:28] these beliefs uh and from that she was
[43:31] able to start seeing the world more
[43:32] objectively but I think for us as humans
[43:35] unfortunately we have an ego and so when
[43:37] we formulate these beliefs and when we
[43:39] attach our ego to these beliefs and we
[43:41] think this is how the world works it's
[43:43] very hard for us to shift and that's
[43:45] where I think unfortunately uh as they
[43:47] say in science what is it science
[43:48] advances every time a uh scientist dies
[43:51] or something like that and it's it's the
[43:54] same thing in in in in World beliefs
[43:56] unfortunately
[43:57] it's the youngest generation that tend
[43:59] to adopt things much quicker because
[44:01] they haven't formulated these hard fast
[44:04] rules of how the world Works they're
[44:06] able to look at the world more
[44:07] objectively and so that's why I really
[44:09] admire when we see a baby boomer who is
[44:11] investing in Bitcoin or I was down in
[44:13] Vancouver only this weekend and there
[44:15] was a 77y old I was helping him take
[44:17] self custody of his Bitcoin that is
[44:19] freaking amazing because these
[44:20] individuals have been in this world
[44:21] believing the world Works a certain way
[44:23] and they've had to completely upend
[44:25] their belief of the world and so it's
[44:27] it's very hard for us to look at the
[44:28] world objectively but I urge anyone
[44:30] listening to this to really step back
[44:32] and question if I'm getting upset about
[44:34] something if someone says something to
[44:36] me and it's triggering me that's not
[44:38] their problem it's actually my problem
[44:40] why why am I getting upset about this
[44:41] thing what is it in my ego that is
[44:43] making me put a wall up and not
[44:46] necessarily question what this other
[44:48] person is saying and so I think it's
[44:49] always important for us as individuals
[44:51] to be curious about the world the moment
[44:53] we have a belief about something the
[44:55] moment we defend we're not being C
[44:57] curious and it's so important to be
[44:58] curious and I think this trust in third
[45:01] parties and in in the government in the
[45:04] states it's still like first of all like
[45:07] trust is always necessary like you're
[45:09] you're never only depending on you you
[45:11] always depend on other people and other
[45:12] third parties uh but uh you can take as
[45:16] much as you can to yourself and in your
[45:19] self-control like just taking your
[45:21] Bitcoin from The Exchange to your
[45:24] self-control and and taking self-
[45:25] custody of that a big step that's a big
[45:28] step that you absolutely can do um but
[45:31] there are still like hardare wallet
[45:33] providers involved in that like you have
[45:34] to trust them also um I Heard a crazy
[45:37] statistic at Bitcoin brag I think from
[45:40] the treasure CEO it was coming the
[45:42] statistic that only 2% of bitcoiners
[45:45] have Hardware wallets and I was like in
[45:48] this uh select early group of people
[45:52] that get Bitcoin and most of them
[45:54] probably are in for the price
[45:56] appreciation and not for the freedom G
[45:58] technology otherwise they would have a
[46:00] harder wallet but even of that small
[46:02] group of people that have Bitcoin only
[46:04] 2% actually take the self custody which
[46:08] for me it's always like when you don't
[46:10] take the self- custody and don't have a
[46:13] hard wallet uh then you you're only in
[46:17] for for the price appreciation uh but
[46:19] not really for for the freedom go up
[46:21] technology for for yourself uh and then
[46:24] I'm like even even in that select crew
[46:26] group uh most don't critical think uh
[46:31] about the trust of third parties and
[46:33] it's okay if you trust a third party uh
[46:36] but uh it's so easy to take self C it's
[46:38] not like with cold where you have like
[46:40] an you have to physically secure it like
[46:42] stuff like that and it's it's it's
[46:44] interesting for me to to look at that
[46:47] it's you know what what comes to mind as
[46:48] you're saying that is that unfortunately
[46:51] the world of which we live in is one
[46:54] where the fear system plays such a huge
[46:57] as we've been discussing such a a huge
[46:59] role in how we sharpen the world and
[47:01] unfortunately I think there are many
[47:03] bitcoiners out there that still look at
[47:06] the world through the lens of fat
[47:07] they're still buying Bitcoin in the
[47:10] hopes that Bitcoin goes up so that they
[47:11] can sell Bitcoin back into the fat world
[47:13] to slightly ease their life and it's a
[47:16] very fat mentality it's it's what can I
[47:18] do to be able to prevent my savings
[47:21] being debased well I'm just going to
[47:23] invest in Bitcoin so it can go up so I
[47:25] can sell it again to kind of support my
[47:27] life and it's a it's a fear way of
[47:29] looking at Bitcoin whereas I think that
[47:30] when we go down the rabbit hole where
[47:32] what I truly admire is when people start
[47:34] thinking in Bitcoin when people start
[47:36] looking at the world through the lens of
[47:37] Bitcoin instead of looking at the world
[47:39] through the lens of Fiat and there when
[47:41] we start looking at the world through
[47:42] the lens of Bitcoin all of a sudden hey
[47:44] I want to save in this thing because
[47:45] over time my cost of living goes down in
[47:47] relation to bitcoin uh sorry yeah in
[47:50] relation to bitcoin all of a sudden life
[47:52] becomes easier and so I'm not going to
[47:54] keep any form of or very little of my
[47:57] savings in fear because I realize it's
[47:59] this thing that's endlessly debating so
[48:01] I want to save in the currency that is
[48:02] superior and I want to look at the world
[48:04] through the lens of Bitcoin which forces
[48:05] collaboration forces a free market
[48:07] separates money from State and it's
[48:09] under that lens that I think we start to
[48:11] Trend more towards a Bitcoin standard
[48:13] but I would say that when you look at a
[48:15] lot of these statistics when you see
[48:17] people throwing out that there's like
[48:18] 200 million crypto users and Bitcoin
[48:20] users globally I I disagree I think that
[48:24] I'd be willing to bet that there's
[48:25] probably like a few million I think
[48:27] there's a few million kind of uh people
[48:29] kind of down the rabbit hole and even
[48:30] down the rabbit hole of bitcoiners that
[48:33] start to look at the world through the
[48:34] lens of Bitcoin and not invest in
[48:36] Bitcoin through the lens of Fiat I think
[48:38] there's only 10 to 10 to 50,000 I think
[48:43] there's very very very few and I think
[48:45] when it comes to custody kind of to your
[48:47] point I think that the the thing that
[48:50] makes me feel a little nervous about the
[48:51] future but we're we're quickly changing
[48:53] that is that custody is intimidating and
[48:56] I think that when we're so used to
[48:58] having a financial system whereby we can
[49:00] pop down to the bank we can set up a
[49:01] bank account uh relatively easy we don't
[49:04] have to have any technical expertise um
[49:07] we can then deposit funds into the bank
[49:09] account we can use it relatively
[49:10] effortlessly and as long as you're an
[49:12] abiding law-abiding citizen that sticks
[49:14] within the rules it doesn't seem like
[49:16] there's any real friction as to using
[49:18] the traditional system the problem is uh
[49:21] it's when you are an individual uh and
[49:24] you're in a totalitarian state when
[49:25] you're in under Authority arianism when
[49:27] you're in a government that you no
[49:29] longer align with the government that
[49:30] you can start to be silenced and we've
[49:32] seen that even in developed countries
[49:33] such as the trucker rally during the
[49:35] pandemic whereas if you're a Canadian
[49:37] and you didn't agree with what Trudeau
[49:38] was doing you had the potential to have
[49:40] your silenced financially you could have
[49:43] your bank account shut down and so I
[49:45] think that
[49:46] Bitcoin kind of to the custody point of
[49:48] view the challenge right now is that
[49:50] we've got this the system the Fiat
[49:52] system that's very easy it's all built
[49:54] around user experience we've got this
[49:55] Bitcoin system which you can custody
[49:57] it's not overly complex but the reality
[49:59] is that it's still quite complex and I
[50:01] think for the average individual it's a
[50:03] little too complex for the average
[50:05] individual to take custody in a way that
[50:06] they can feel comfortable and sleep well
[50:09] at night especially if you live in an
[50:11] apartment you live with roommates how
[50:14] can we effectively support people in
[50:16] storing their private keys so they don't
[50:18] feel like there's a risk that if the
[50:19] house burns down they're going to lose
[50:20] their private key or if someone stumbled
[50:23] upon their private key there's not going
[50:24] to be a risk of loss of funds and so
[50:26] that's where do think as time goes by
[50:28] we're having more solutions but it is
[50:30] still very hard at the moment and uh
[50:33] that that's where I think we need a
[50:34] trend towards a world where we've got
[50:35] more and more Bitcoin developers working
[50:37] on these Solutions and it is happening
[50:39] and we already have a few of those
[50:41] Solutions I often uh compare it with
[50:44] like the internet adoption when we look
[50:47] B like just 20 30 years uh how hard it
[50:51] was to send uh information over the
[50:55] Internet uh and now my grandma is on
[50:58] WhatsApp like like everyone can send
[51:01] send messages but how hard was it in the
[51:04] early days to have to set up and then it
[51:06] got easier and easier and easier and
[51:08] even like now like we I have always have
[51:10] this this small prop device uh uh like
[51:14] like for me it's already pretty easy
[51:18] like you have a hardware wet to set it
[51:20] up uh then if you have higher number of
[51:23] of Bitcoin or like have a substantial
[51:25] amount in bit coin makes sense to make
[51:28] like a multi signature thing and then
[51:30] you can like depending on your personal
[51:33] situation you can go even beyond that
[51:35] and see like can I distribute the self-
[51:37] custody devices throughout jurisdictions
[51:39] and stuff like that that's like more the
[51:41] complicate stuff but the easy stuff like
[51:43] just taking your keys there's there's a
[51:46] lot as you said to to think about uh and
[51:49] there's a lot of Technology coming like
[51:51] I interviewed saor on on in in Bitcoin
[51:54] brag and and and he talked about like
[51:56] what happened if Apple all of the sudden
[51:58] encounters Bitcoin and he said like they
[52:01] will want their customers to have the
[52:04] Bitcoin on their devices they can make
[52:06] chips on on their iPhones and then all
[52:08] of a sudden uh you can sign a Bitcoin
[52:10] transaction holding your iPhone to your
[52:12] Apple watch and then you have your multi
[52:14] signature thing I it's like I would not
[52:16] recommend that I don't know if Apple
[52:18] ever does that I would still recommend
[52:20] having your offline devices but it's
[52:23] interesting like uh in the early days of
[52:25] the internet I heard that uh people said
[52:28] everyone will have their own email
[52:30] servers but now everything is running on
[52:32] Gmail like it will be interesting how
[52:35] how this whole scaling of Bitcoin and
[52:38] and how how do we onboard actually
[52:41] really a lot of people because to your
[52:42] point I also think that there are not a
[52:45] lot of people in Bitcoin I since one and
[52:48] a half years I have a Twitter list with
[52:51] bitcoiners in there granted they are
[52:53] just English bitcoiners and some German
[52:55] ones but
[52:56] mostly only English people I have a a
[52:59] Bitcoin list with uh people that
[53:02] regularly tweet about Bitcoin and I just
[53:05] have this list uh and I started last
[53:07] year with like 200 bitcoiners in there
[53:09] and now they're like 400 in there or
[53:11] something like that maximum 500 I'm like
[53:14] I have really a hard time finding more
[53:16] people for that list like it's it's it's
[53:19] like oh and he's already in there ah
[53:20] he's already and she's already in there
[53:22] like there are not a lot of people that
[53:24] actively have Bitcoin and talk about it
[53:27] and which also then is an indicator like
[53:29] there are probably not that many actual
[53:31] bitcoiners that actually understand it
[53:32] and have the capacity to to think and
[53:36] talk about it uh so yeah I like would be
[53:39] really interesting for example like how
[53:41] many people actually have a hard wet how
[53:42] many people uh actually uh like like do
[53:47] do go beyond just like oh yeah I have
[53:50] like a thousand or like 100 EUR on some
[53:52] Bitcoin exchange laying around I think
[53:54] those people are a lot they are like not
[53:58] not that few but how many actually did
[54:00] the work and and and read like or how
[54:03] many people uh bought 10 Bitcoin books
[54:06] that would also be an interesting
[54:07] statistic for to look at oh man I I
[54:10] couldn't agree more and what's
[54:11] interesting and this may be a bit more
[54:12] of a kind of a controversial opinion but
[54:15] that is that the way that I see things
[54:17] transitioning is that we need to make as
[54:20] a Bitcoin community and this isn't
[54:23] obviously me as an individual but given
[54:24] that I'm not a developer I don't know
[54:26] how to build a hardware wallet but as a
[54:28] community we need to make self- custody
[54:30] incredibly easy and what will happen is
[54:32] if over time we Trend towards a Bitcoin
[54:35] standard if we make self- custody easy
[54:37] then we're always going to have a
[54:38] portion of the populace that are going
[54:40] to take self- custody of their Bitcoin
[54:42] but I also recognize that I think it's
[54:46] naive to believe that we're going to
[54:47] have everybody who is holding Bitcoin
[54:49] take custody of their Bitcoin however if
[54:52] we have a Bitcoin standard and Bitcoin
[54:54] is being used in many of these jur
[54:56] itions globally then you're going to
[54:58] have banks that yes they allow
[55:00] individuals and they they're a bank
[55:02] they're Bitcoin custodian and people are
[55:04] going to be using that bank to custody
[55:06] their Bitcoin but unlike gold because
[55:09] the challenge with gold is that it's
[55:10] physical in nature and because it's
[55:12] physical nature it became cumbersome to
[55:13] store because it came cumbersome to
[55:15] store people ended up relying on the
[55:17] banks and there the banks recognized hey
[55:19] no one's coming back to withdraw their
[55:21] gold so they ended up lending out or
[55:23] giving out more I as opposed to the
[55:26] deposits they had in reserve and with
[55:28] Bitcoin if we have an easy way for
[55:30] people to take custody of their Bitcoin
[55:32] then all of a sudden that
[55:33] disincentivizes Banks to fractionalize
[55:36] the amount of IUS in relation to their
[55:38] reserves and if they do so oh alarm
[55:41] going off if they do so you end up with
[55:43] a whole FTX situation where FTX I think
[55:46] had something like 1.2 Bitcoin backing
[55:50] $1.6 billion do in reserves uh sorry
[55:53] billion dollars in liabilities and so
[55:55] under that situation they were just like
[55:57] well people aren't coming back to
[55:58] withdraw their Bitcoin well people
[56:00] recognize hey we don't think we don't
[56:01] believe you have our reserves so we're
[56:03] going to withdraw our Bitcoin and all of
[56:05] a sudden they couldn't facilitate that
[56:07] and they went under and so I think that
[56:09] if we were to transition to a a Bitcoin
[56:12] standard what I do believe is that if
[56:14] Bitcoin as long as it is easy enough to
[56:16] take custody then you're always going to
[56:17] get a portion that take custody but
[56:20] because of that portion that takes
[56:21] custody the banks have an obligation or
[56:24] they have an incentive not to fracture
[56:26] and so there's still going to be a large
[56:28] portion of people using custodial
[56:29] systems I wouldn't recommend that now I
[56:31] don't think we're there yet I think that
[56:33] the the current system is takes
[56:36] advantage of individuals takes advantage
[56:38] of deposits uh reh hypothecate
[56:40] fractionalize you name it and I think
[56:42] that's also one of the reasons why we're
[56:43] also seeing a suppression of price right
[56:45] now when you look at the adoption rate
[56:48] kind of like now with Bitcoin um would
[56:51] you say like one of like I see that way
[56:53] like when we see uh the whole uh Bitcoin
[56:56] adoption uh and how many people still
[56:58] trust all the systems that we have built
[57:00] with the Fiat system over the in the
[57:03] last decades is the pain just not not
[57:05] high enough is is people like ah okay
[57:07] inflation is high and uh but it's it's
[57:10] it's not that bad yes it's coming down
[57:13] the inflation again like I I hear it a
[57:15] lot obviously I'm living in an austrial
[57:17] bubble uh I'm I'm in a quite developed
[57:21] and and and beautiful country as as I
[57:23] see it and there are other people in
[57:25] this world but do you also think that
[57:27] the pain is just not high enough for for
[57:29] people to actually Open the Eyes this I
[57:32] think there's a couple components I
[57:33] think the first component is the that
[57:36] idea that we talked about previously
[57:38] where people have these beliefs and
[57:40] these beliefs shape their worldview and
[57:42] it's very hard for them to believe that
[57:44] there's anything Sinister about the
[57:46] current monetary system and because of
[57:48] this I think people think well this is
[57:51] just something that happens and the
[57:52] government is doing its best and the
[57:54] central bank is doing its best just
[57:56] trying to control the system and it's
[57:57] kind of outside their bounds of control
[57:59] and one of the reasons why I believe
[58:01] people think this is from the 1980s and
[58:04] before the definition of inflation in
[58:07] the dictionary used to be inflation is
[58:10] an increasing monetary units resulting
[58:13] in a rise in prices then the government
[58:15] changed the definition of inflation in
[58:17] 1980 onwards to inflation is a rise in
[58:19] prices so what that allows the
[58:21] government to do is to come out and say
[58:23] right now our number one Beast that
[58:25] we're trying to fight is inflation when
[58:27] in reality they're the ones who are
[58:29] causing inflation they're increasing
[58:30] their monetary units resulting in a rise
[58:31] in prices and so this is when you see
[58:33] people like Biden get massive support
[58:37] across the whole nation supporting the
[58:39] inflation reduction act where they go
[58:40] and print trillions of dollars that's
[58:42] completely nonsensical how do you print
[58:44] money to reduce inflation it doesn't
[58:46] work and so I think that unfortunately
[58:48] our world has bought into this idea that
[58:50] inflation is this Beast that we need to
[58:51] fight not recognizing that it's the
[58:53] government that is creating inflation
[58:55] and on top of that it's very hard for
[58:58] people to see outside of the system at
[59:01] which they are in and I think that's
[59:02] where as Bitcoin is we recognize that uh
[59:06] our current monetary system the Fiat
[59:07] monetary system is just one option there
[59:10] are other options such as Bitcoin
[59:12] whereas to the average individual they
[59:13] can't see any of that they just think
[59:15] that money is the way that it is we just
[59:17] have to deal with it and so I think that
[59:19] as time goes by as the pain increases at
[59:22] some point the pain to hold on to our
[59:25] leld beliefs our world beliefs becomes
[59:28] lesser than the pain that we are
[59:30] immediately feeling in terms of hey I
[59:33] can't even afford to feed my family
[59:34] right now and that's where we see
[59:36] countries like Argentina and people
[59:38] start to you know what I'm not going to
[59:40] vote for the socialist government I'm
[59:41] going to vote right because these
[59:43] governments have been promising for so
[59:45] long that they're going to intervene
[59:46] they're going to support us they're
[59:48] going to the economy is going to be
[59:49] great the future's going to be bright
[59:50] and I feel like it's the opposite life
[59:53] is getting harder and harder and harder
[59:54] so we're starting to see that but I
[59:56] think that we're still quite a ways off
[59:58] given that if you look at Argentina
[59:59] they've annualized I think 60% inflation
[60:02] over the last 50 60 years Western
[60:05] countries have annualized two to 3%
[60:07] inflation even though I think that
[60:09] number is far higher but let's just take
[60:11] CPI they've annualized two to 3%
[60:13] inflation over the last quite a while so
[60:15] we've got very different inflation
[60:17] numbers to something like Argentina and
[60:19] Argentina has just
[60:20] flipped and we should not forget I think
[60:24] Jeff Bo makes a wonderful work that that
[60:26] we have a massive force of deflation
[60:29] like a massive deflationary force with
[60:31] the advancement in technology with
[60:32] advancement in Ai and advancment with
[60:34] robotics and everything like that this
[60:36] this drives actually prices down a lot
[60:39] uh so like this inflation rate of like
[60:41] oh we have now like 5% higher prices
[60:44] first of like they manipulate what comes
[60:46] in that basket and then this basket is
[60:49] actually drawn down by by technical
[60:51] advancement so like uh it's it's uh
[60:54] would be interesting like that uh
[60:57] massive in deflationary force we would
[61:00] have inflation rates of 40 50% actually
[61:03] inflation rate of the uh monetary
[61:06] expansion and this is uh this is a thing
[61:08] where uh I I never heard that with the
[61:11] that the change the definition of
[61:13] inflation from like uh it's about the
[61:15] price not about inflating the the units
[61:19] uh really interesting to see yeah you
[61:21] know what it's this point you mentioned
[61:23] about Jeff I listen to a talk with Jeff
[61:25] I think it was on what Bitcoin did this
[61:27] was probably three years ago and it was
[61:30] one of those really like aha moments I'd
[61:32] read the price of Tomorrow previously
[61:35] but this is just one of those moments
[61:36] that really clicked and he was saying
[61:37] that when we think about inflation and
[61:39] we see the CPI of say 2 3% what we're
[61:42] forgetting is that we're not measuring
[61:44] from the zero bound if inflation is
[61:46] minus5 minus 10% year over year over
[61:48] year because of advanc Technology then
[61:51] if we've got inflation of 3% but it's
[61:53] actually meant to be minus 10 then it's
[61:55] it's actually 133% and so I think that
[61:58] many of us look at it and think well
[62:00] inflation at 3% that's from the zero
[62:01] bound no because prices should as you
[62:03] say they should be falling and the other
[62:05] point is that when you really start
[62:07] digging into CPI you just realize how
[62:09] manipulated it is you look at things
[62:11] like honic adjustments a Honda Civic
[62:14] over the last I think 30 years through
[62:17] CPI has stayed exactly the same price
[62:20] but the reason why they can get around
[62:22] saying it stayed exactly the same price
[62:23] when actually the car has gone from
[62:25] probably 5 ,000 to 15,000 to 30,000 is
[62:29] because each time you have a new model
[62:31] released there's slight little changes
[62:33] to it there's a little bit of
[62:34] technological advancement and they say
[62:36] well if if last year it was 27,000 and
[62:38] this year it's 30,000 well because you
[62:40] now get uh an upgraded satnav system
[62:43] that accounts for that extra 3,000 so
[62:45] the actual inflation when you take into
[62:47] account technological advancement is
[62:49] zero and so this is how they say well
[62:51] prices have not risen and then the other
[62:53] thing that I think people don't quite
[62:54] understand is that because um inflation
[62:57] is a basket of goods if those
[62:59] individuals in society are going and
[63:01] buying grass-fed beef and they're able
[63:03] to afford grass-fed beef but then all of
[63:05] a sudden prices start to rise and they
[63:06] can't quite afford grass-fed beef
[63:08] anymore so then they go and buy the
[63:10] impossible soy Burger instead so they
[63:12] transition from grass-fed beef to The
[63:13] Impossible soy Burger Which is far
[63:15] cheaper what ends up happening is the
[63:17] basket changes because they're saying
[63:19] consumer preferences are changing no
[63:21] consumer preferences aren't changing
[63:23] it's because they can't afford grass
[63:24] faed beef so what ends up happening is
[63:26] that the basket doesn't um doesn't
[63:29] indicate a rise in prices because
[63:30] they're just saying consumer preferences
[63:32] are changing and so we never see the
[63:33] rise in prices of people transitioning
[63:36] from one product to another because they
[63:37] can't afford the old product and so CPI
[63:39] inflation is is so misleading it is far
[63:42] far far higher if you look at I'm just
[63:44] trying to remember there is I can't
[63:46] quite remember the name of the site
[63:47] there's a website that looks at some of
[63:49] the old ways they used to measure CPI
[63:52] and if you go and look at CPI from the
[63:54] 1970s and use that same basket of goods
[63:56] today inflation is sitting in the high
[63:58] teens at low
[64:01] 20s is there a metrics that you that you
[64:03] look at uh that the most accurately
[64:07] describes the inflation rate right now
[64:10] it's it's challenging because inflation
[64:12] in general is a misnomer inflation is
[64:15] unique to the individual person what I
[64:17] spend my money on is different to what
[64:19] you spend your money on and so for me I
[64:21] like mountain biking I like the outdoors
[64:23] and I want to try and buy a small little
[64:25] Farmstead in the future if Bitcoin does
[64:27] its thing I want to buy a small little
[64:28] Farmstead whereas for you you probably
[64:30] look at different things and so
[64:31] inflation is unique to the individual
[64:33] and so as a society when we try to uh
[64:36] come together and say inflation is this
[64:38] value it's a useless metric and
[64:41] unfortunately that useless metric is is
[64:43] is governing how we direct Central
[64:46] planning it's how we direct the freaking
[64:48] the central banks the government and so
[64:50] I think that it is something that under
[64:52] a free market it doesn't exist it only
[64:54] exists under Central planning but to
[64:55] your point there is that website and I
[64:57] can always find it and send it to you
[64:58] and you can put it in the show notes
[65:00] there is a website and I've completely
[65:01] blanked on the name of it um that looks
[65:04] at CPI through traditional ways of
[65:08] measuring and what you recognize as CPI
[65:10] is a hell of a lot higher they just
[65:11] constantly adjust CPI in order to
[65:13] minimize the inflation rate or the
[65:15] perceived inflation rate I only know
[65:17] about true infation I don't know if you
[65:19] mean that but probably something else I
[65:21] think it's something else uh definitely
[65:25] it's always interesting for me when you
[65:26] look at inflation obviously it's it's
[65:28] different like when when
[65:30] you when you live in someone's basements
[65:33] you don't have to pay rent you only
[65:35] watch Netflix and and that's all what
[65:37] you're doing uh your inflation like you
[65:39] don't care about
[65:41] inflation the subscription cost of
[65:44] Netflix will not go up too much uh so
[65:48] like but if you want especially if you
[65:49] want a good life if you want to have
[65:52] like go in a good restaurant eat that
[65:55] good state
[65:56] go on this buy maybe a house near like a
[65:59] good neighborhood or like next to a lake
[66:02] all of the sudden you have an actual
[66:03] inflation rate uh of like 50 60 maybe
[66:06] 100% depending on on what kind of of of
[66:09] of Life do you want so it's like uh yes
[66:12] you you you can minimize your your life
[66:14] to a certain extents where you don't
[66:16] have much inflation inflation doesn't
[66:18] bother you but uh if if you actually
[66:20] like uh want anything in life then it's
[66:23] more like on a 50 60 70% and even if
[66:25] you're just a normal human being your
[66:28] inflation rate uh is is is quite high
[66:30] with like I don't know in the the low
[66:32] teens or or whatever the the inflation
[66:34] rate is plus then as we covered before
[66:37] the that we starting from the zero and
[66:38] we should start from like minus 10us 15
[66:41] or something like that yeah really
[66:43] interesting um I I could go on and talk
[66:45] with you like on hours on end uh but uh
[66:49] let's come slowly to to our end routine
[66:52] uh which is now two questions and the
[66:54] first question this that I always ask
[66:57] bitcoiners on my podcast now is uh I
[67:01] asked that question because I think
[67:02] bitcoiners are unique persons and we're
[67:04] in an early group and we can learn from
[67:06] each other and benefit from each other
[67:07] and that's why I'm asking what are you
[67:09] currently passionate about or deeply
[67:11] learning about besides Bitcoin what am I
[67:14] learning about besides Bitcoin okay you
[67:15] know what so I've always been fascinated
[67:20] in just kind of how we learn I think
[67:22] that we're never taught in school how we
[67:25] learn we're just just kind of taught to
[67:26] kind of consume information and
[67:27] regurgitate information tests many times
[67:30] are just us learning how to regurgitate
[67:32] information but that doesn't actually
[67:34] mean we understand the information and
[67:36] so I think as an educator as someone who
[67:39] has written books as someone who started
[67:40] the Looking Glass education our platform
[67:43] where we basically create content for
[67:45] bitcoiners learning about how the world
[67:46] works I always want to try and improve
[67:49] people's engagement improves people's
[67:51] learning Effectiveness uh and one of the
[67:54] things that I've been looking at is
[67:56] as individuals when we're interested in
[67:58] something it Sparks that fire in our in
[68:01] our mind and this is kind of this Flow
[68:03] State that people talk about and when
[68:04] we're in this Flow State and we're
[68:06] interested in something our capacity to
[68:07] learn is immense when we're out of that
[68:10] flow State when we're not really
[68:11] interested in something it's very hard
[68:12] for us to learn and the problem with
[68:14] traditional Academia and traditional
[68:15] ways of learning is that you have a very
[68:18] linear way of learning you do module one
[68:20] you do module two you do module three
[68:21] you do module four and if you find any
[68:24] of these subjects boring well you're
[68:25] stuck kind of approaching it this this
[68:27] very linear way and so at the moment
[68:29] I've been since February I've been
[68:31] working for a company based out of uh
[68:33] was about five hours from me here in
[68:35] Canada called block rewards and we are
[68:38] we want to help support individuals
[68:40] basically be paid and compensated in
[68:42] Bitcoin and I want to be able to create
[68:45] an educational Journey for users of our
[68:48] platform and hopefully for other users
[68:50] making a lot of free content as well I
[68:52] want to be able to create an educational
[68:53] Journey that's quite Dynamic and so so
[68:55] that Dynamic Learning Journey allows
[68:57] individuals to go at their pace and to
[69:00] jump around in a way that more easily
[69:02] represents how we actually learn which
[69:04] is that when we find something
[69:06] interesting we go and explore that topic
[69:07] and then we go back and then we continue
[69:09] and then we find something else
[69:10] interesting we go and explore this topic
[69:11] and so one thing that I'm interested in
[69:13] right now is trying to figure out the
[69:15] most effective way to be able to create
[69:17] more of these Dynamic adaptive learning
[69:19] Journeys to be able to improve education
[69:22] and engagement because I think so much
[69:23] of our traditional Academia so much of
[69:25] our online courses so much of the
[69:28] content we consume is far too linear
[69:30] which just causes people to drop off we
[69:32] we lose engagement we don't really find
[69:34] it interesting and not only that but
[69:36] when you have a linear Learning Journey
[69:37] if you're an economist and you and then
[69:40] another person is say a mother of three
[69:41] kids and you're reading the same course
[69:44] well how do you keep engagement because
[69:46] what you want out of the course your
[69:47] pain points what resonates with you is
[69:49] so different and so that's where having
[69:50] these kind of more Dynamic adaptive
[69:52] learning Journeys hopefully will allow a
[69:54] broader subset of individuals to be able
[69:56] to consume the same content it's just
[69:59] they're consuming it in different ways
[70:00] from different angles and that's that's
[70:01] something I'm really passionate about
[70:03] trying to support people in their
[70:04] learning that's an amazing thing and
[70:07] education is so underrated like uh when
[70:10] we go in this uh this world out and
[70:13] everyone is like oh I I don't I hate
[70:15] learning I no you don't hate learning
[70:18] you hate the educational system that you
[70:20] grew up in like learning is something
[70:23] amazing I I love it so much it's it's
[70:25] like I I I wish I had like even more
[70:28] time to learn which is is fascinating to
[70:30] have the podcast because I can actually
[70:32] learn from you now and I can learn from
[70:33] other people and that's that's that's
[70:35] great thing like learning is the the
[70:37] most rewarding thing you can do in in
[70:38] this world I I highly appreciate that
[70:41] you you brought up this topic and and uh
[70:43] and I highly and also agree a lot with
[70:46] that well I was just going to add as
[70:48] well like it's interesting because when
[70:49] you are in conversation with someone you
[70:53] are learning in a dynamic way because if
[70:55] someone you're going down an Avenue and
[70:57] someone starts talking about something
[70:59] and you're like hey you made this point
[71:00] that was really interesting I'm curious
[71:01] can you expand on that and that's is
[71:03] this Dynamic way we're not linearly
[71:05] learning we're not just listening to the
[71:06] person monologue at us for an hour and a
[71:08] half we're able to jump in and out of
[71:10] the areas that we find interesting and
[71:12] so it's if we're able to just support
[71:14] people in their learning I think we're
[71:15] going to have a world where people are
[71:17] so much more engaged people also have
[71:19] much deeper knowledge in their
[71:20] respective areas and what's helped me
[71:22] immensely as an individual is and I feel
[71:25] so lucky about this CU I dropped out of
[71:27] school when I was 14 I hated school I I
[71:29] really really struggled with it and when
[71:32] I kind of hit my late teenss I could
[71:34] honestly maybe up until
[71:36] 2022 I could count the amount of books
[71:38] I'd read on one hand like I had barely
[71:40] read anything but I was very passionate
[71:42] about learning in biomechanical
[71:44] movements I wanted to learn how to do a
[71:46] back flip on a bike I wanted to learn
[71:47] how to do a corner I wanted to learn
[71:49] just different ways of learning and in
[71:51] my kind of early 20s I really started to
[71:53] recognize man I I freaking love learning
[71:55] learning but I want to figure out how to
[71:56] learn about the financial markets and
[71:58] how to learn about the world around me
[71:59] and psychology you name it and what
[72:02] helped me immensely was I started to
[72:04] take notes on what it is that I was
[72:06] learning and I took notes and so now I
[72:08] feel very lucky when I wrote the hidden
[72:10] cost of money the book we talked about
[72:11] when I wrote the hidden cost of money if
[72:13] you go to the back of the book I think
[72:14] there's 500 citations and those there's
[72:17] so many there's that many citations
[72:19] because I had 10 plus years of all of
[72:22] these books that I've read and I was
[72:23] able to reference them in all of my
[72:25] notes and so I I feel really lucky to
[72:27] have been able to find my ability to
[72:29] learn the way that I learn and I urge
[72:31] anyone listening to this to if you're
[72:32] not interested in learning find how you
[72:35] learn pick up on what it is that makes
[72:37] you tick and the things that you're
[72:38] interested in because once you find your
[72:39] way of learning the world is a freaking
[72:41] fascinating place and I should also say
[72:43] if anyone's listening to this that has
[72:45] experience in creating like Dynamic
[72:47] educational Journeys or feel free to
[72:49] reach out because i' be I'd love to chat
[72:51] really really cool and I usually ask
[72:53] that question uh after the
[72:55] after the end team question but uh where
[72:58] can people find you where can people ask
[72:59] you questions uh and and reach out to
[73:01] you for sure um so you can just check me
[73:04] out on Twitter which is just said bunny
[73:05] SB Buu n NE y um you can also check out
[73:09] looking glass education which is I
[73:11] founded it and I think you actually had
[73:13] a talk with dab so dab is like he's my
[73:17] business partner we founded looking
[73:18] glass with Greg Foss and a couple others
[73:20] um about four or five years ago and our
[73:23] whole goal is just basically to still
[73:24] down
[73:25] macroeconomics Finance Bitcoin for the
[73:28] lay person to still it down into kind of
[73:31] jargon free content and we have a
[73:33] mixture of free courses uh and materials
[73:36] and then outside of that I do have a
[73:38] website said bunny.com um and that whole
[73:41] website I kind of just have my podcasts
[73:43] I have the the books that we've written
[73:45] you name it but
[73:47] yeah amazing perfect then let's come to
[73:50] our Andro team uh where the previous
[73:52] guest is asking a question uh for the
[73:54] next guest without knowing who the next
[73:56] guest actually is uh and the question
[73:58] for you is aside from owning Bitcoin
[74:00] what's something you do or have done to
[74:03] enhance uh your sovereignty H that's a
[74:06] really good
[74:08] question there's a couple different
[74:10] things that I am thinking about you
[74:13] could approach that question from a
[74:14] couple different ways the first way that
[74:16] I'm thinking about approaching it
[74:18] is you know so I discussed this idea
[74:21] that I was a man and biker for a long
[74:23] time when I first started teaching
[74:25] mountain biking I quickly recognized
[74:28] that um these individuals that I was
[74:32] working with as a kid I idolized them
[74:35] they were in these massive Mana bike
[74:37] movies they were kind of like the the
[74:39] the Tiger Woods of the mountain bike
[74:41] world and many of them were struggling
[74:43] financially many of them they didn't
[74:45] have uh enough income to be able to
[74:48] purchase a property they were up to
[74:49] their neck and credit card debt but they
[74:51] were supposedly living the dream and
[74:52] they were on the world stage and this
[74:54] made me recognized that you know what if
[74:56] I if I want to be able to pursue the
[74:57] life that I want to be able to live if I
[74:59] want to be able to be a man and by
[75:00] instructor I have to have passive income
[75:02] streams and so I think that as
[75:05] individuals although I have a lot of
[75:07] weight of my portfolio in Bitcoin what
[75:09] really helped me immensely was
[75:10] recognizing that if if my only way to
[75:13] earn money is through my day job then
[75:14] that means I have to work in order to be
[75:16] able to earn money and so I ended up um
[75:19] investing in real estate and it's
[75:20] obviously a lot harder these days given
[75:22] the the cost of real estate but I feel
[75:23] so lucky that I ended up investing in
[75:25] real estate when I was younger I think
[75:27] purchased my first place when I was 19
[75:28] and having those passive income streams
[75:30] allowed me to be able to
[75:33] pursue things that actually motivated me
[75:36] given that I didn't have to expend time
[75:37] and energy to be able to just earn money
[75:39] and earn a paycheck and so I urge anyone
[75:41] to be able to think about how do you
[75:43] create passive income streams that way
[75:45] you can have more time to be able to
[75:47] pursue the things that motivate you and
[75:49] honestly if it wasn't for my real estate
[75:51] I wouldn't have been able to write the
[75:53] hidden cost of money I spent a year
[75:55] writing that book probably 30 hours a
[75:56] week writing that book and as as you
[75:58] guys probably know when you're writing a
[76:00] book you're not getting paid to write a
[76:01] book and uh to be honest even writing a
[76:04] book is not a massive monetary Endeavor
[76:06] I I wrote it because I wanted to give
[76:07] something back to the community and to
[76:08] share my opinions and so being able to
[76:11] have passive income streams is something
[76:12] that's very important to me um and the
[76:15] challenge now that I find is okay if I
[76:17] have real estate and Bitcoin well I'd
[76:19] rather have Bitcoin but Bitcoin doesn't
[76:20] provide a passive passive uh income
[76:23] Stream So now I've sold most of my real
[76:24] estate and rolled it into Bitcoin but I
[76:27] still think that if if you have the
[76:28] potential to build passive income
[76:29] streams whether it's through real estate
[76:31] whether it's through business that's
[76:32] that's incredibly important and then
[76:34] outside of that in terms of sovereignty
[76:38] I would also say not only on kind of the
[76:41] monetary front but I think that working
[76:44] on yourself as an individual is so
[76:46] incredibly important I don't think we
[76:47] quite understand as to how much our
[76:50] childhood environment shapes how we show
[76:52] up all of us like have faced trauma
[76:54] trauma is subjective some people think
[76:57] oh I had to have had some heinous
[76:58] upbringing in order to have trauma
[76:59] that's not necessarily true we can have
[77:01] trauma that we don't even remember if we
[77:03] had never injured oursel and at the age
[77:05] of 10 years old we roll our ankle that
[77:07] in it itself could be traumatic and so I
[77:09] think that doing personal work on
[77:11] ourselves understanding how we are
[77:13] showing up in the world understanding
[77:14] our own emotional triggers our
[77:16] relationships with our parents gives us
[77:18] more sovereignty over our ability to
[77:21] show up whole wholeheartedly and
[77:22] authentically and not responding from
[77:24] the past and so I really urge anyone if
[77:26] you want to grow in this world to build
[77:29] our relationship with oursel build our
[77:30] relationship with our inner child build
[77:32] our relationship with our parents and
[77:34] and I think that that helps us show up
[77:36] more authentically uh without responding
[77:39] from the past which many of us are stuck
[77:40] kind of responding from trauma
[77:41] responding from the
[77:44] past I love it a lot this answer it it's
[77:47] like I'm tempted to open like a a whole
[77:50] new topic but I think uh we we can make
[77:53] a second round in half a year year or
[77:55] something like that uh to have all those
[77:57] open topics discussed and yeah thank you
[77:59] for for being on uh SE and for everyone
[78:02] watching and listening thank you for
[78:03] watching and I'll be back tomorrow with
[78:05] another episode byebye thanks again Rod
[78:07] I really appreciate it
