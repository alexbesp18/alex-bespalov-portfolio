[00:00] saving as I said is not enough you have
[00:02] to put your money into assets that are
[00:04] going to at least keep up with the
[00:06] inflation that you're seeing and the
[00:08] rise in cost uh for your day-to-day
[00:10] expenses this conflation between
[00:12] investing and saving I think is really
[00:15] the key to helping the fire Community
[00:18] understand that Bitcoin is actually a
[00:20] better vehicle for doing that than the
[00:22] stock market index that's what the fire
[00:24] movement is about is getting you to that
[00:26] place as as quickly and as early on in
[00:28] life where you have these opport unities
[00:30] and options that you don't have if you
[00:33] if you don't yet have that Financial
[00:35] Independence you are one of the
[00:37] interesting guest that went from that uh
[00:40] banking feat world uh into the the new
[00:43] area of of Bitcoin the new uh area uh
[00:47] that we are kind of all into um before
[00:49] we start into the whole topics with fire
[00:52] and self- custody that I want to get
[00:53] into um maybe let's quickly why did you
[00:57] went into Bitcoin uh especially with
[01:00] Goldman Sachs deoy really big companies
[01:02] you probably had a really good job there
[01:05] and then just transitioning into Bitcoin
[01:08] it's a big step uh and uh why did you do
[01:11] that and was what it like did you had
[01:14] had any difficulties any challenges
[01:16] during that
[01:18] time yeah I um I think in a lot of ways
[01:22] Bitcoin came before my career in um in
[01:26] finance although it was from the roots
[01:29] of the libertarian movement that I kind
[01:32] of came up in and my thought process
[01:35] around the time that the financial
[01:36] crisis hit in 2008 so I started kind of
[01:40] getting into the uh sound money
[01:43] principles and libertarianism and um you
[01:47] know anarch capitalism and like all of
[01:49] those thought processes that dovetail
[01:51] very well with the way that Bitcoin
[01:54] exists in the world and the kind of
[01:57] principles that underly it and so I was
[02:00] very much primed to be receptive to
[02:02] bitcoin when it started to come across
[02:05] my radar in in maybe 2011 uh at the time
[02:08] I was working for Goldman Sachs and my
[02:11] my background is is pretty broad around
[02:14] Consulting and finance and banking um
[02:17] sales and um and technology and so like
[02:22] all of those different disciplines
[02:25] obviously have a lot in common with
[02:27] Bitcoin and and the message that that it
[02:30] kind of portrays to the world guess
[02:32] Bitcoin doesn't really have a message so
[02:33] to speak but those messages kind of come
[02:36] out of The Ether of what it is and how
[02:38] it operates and the incentive structure
[02:40] that's at play there and um you know so
[02:44] although I didn't like really start to
[02:46] get Bitcoin until much later in in my
[02:50] journey it was kind of just there
[02:52] underneath the the surface um lurking as
[02:55] a part of this framework of
[02:58] understanding or framework of thought
[03:00] that um I had been developing uh from
[03:03] kind of the political side of things and
[03:05] um know I'd always been kind of
[03:07] fascinated by Banking and the stock
[03:10] market and investing and that kind of
[03:12] thing and that's what led me to the path
[03:15] of going um with my career toward
[03:19] working at the likes of well deoe
[03:22] Consulting in the technology practice
[03:24] but then focusing on financial services
[03:26] and banking um and then I spent three
[03:27] years at Goldman Sachs um I spent a year
[03:30] and a half at MetLife um doing some
[03:32] internal management consulting and and
[03:34] helping people improve the way they work
[03:36] um and then came back into banking more
[03:40] on the Capital Market side um and and
[03:42] spent about six years at sunrust which
[03:46] became truest as part of a merger with
[03:48] bbmt uh and truest is right now the the
[03:51] sixth largest bank um in in the US um so
[03:56] pretty powerful position there and I
[03:58] spent my days mostly on the trading
[04:01] floor doing risk and p&l Analysis for
[04:04] the capital markets trading desks um so
[04:06] I really like that analytical framework
[04:09] um trade flows and um working with
[04:12] different people across the life cycle
[04:14] of a trade and the operational side of
[04:16] things um and it was so I first bought
[04:19] Bitcoin around 2014 and then around 2018
[04:22] 2019 is where I really started to get
[04:25] it um and I started you know more dollar
[04:28] cost averaging I found
[04:30] the financial Independence retire early
[04:33] framework around that same time as well
[04:35] um and so I I just like for whatever
[04:39] reason it took
[04:40] me that long to find the right people
[04:43] and to really take the time to dig into
[04:45] Bitcoin and really start to understand
[04:47] it why it had value and why I should pay
[04:48] attention to it and why I should
[04:50] allocate more Capital to it um and so
[04:53] then leading into uh late 2019 2020 I
[04:58] kind of saw the writing on the wall for
[05:00] what would be coming after the having
[05:02] and this bull market that we all
[05:03] expected which turned out to to actually
[05:05] come to fruition and I put together a
[05:08] deck within my uh presentation within my
[05:12] um you know banking job called Bitcoin
[05:15] for Bankers um I was expecting that as
[05:17] that bull market played out that people
[05:20] around me would just have questions
[05:21] about it they'd be interested to learn
[05:24] and so I thought you know who better
[05:26] than me who has taken the time to
[05:28] understand this does own some already
[05:30] has some deep conviction to be able to
[05:33] answer their questions and I approached
[05:35] that presentation along the lines of
[05:37] like okay well why should you care you
[05:40] should care because your clients are
[05:41] going to care they're going to start
[05:43] asking you questions and you you don't
[05:44] want to look like an idiot right like
[05:46] you want to have some kind of
[05:47] intelligent responses to these questions
[05:49] that they're going to be asking you uh
[05:51] so let me give you the foundation of
[05:52] what that should look like and be there
[05:54] to to answer some questions for you and
[05:57] that was pretty popular as things were
[05:58] really heating up in 2020 and
[06:01] 2021 um and that led to an opportunity
[06:04] to join uh what the bank called a crypto
[06:07] working group in 2021 where the board of
[06:11] dire directors for truist this massive
[06:13] Bank was starting to ask questions about
[06:16] the broader landscape um should they be
[06:19] involved what should the strategy be if
[06:22] anything like let's just get a
[06:23] foundational understanding there and so
[06:25] I was asked to join this working group
[06:28] as the Bitcoin subject matter expert and
[06:31] um you know I was uh honored and and
[06:34] privileged enough to provide my
[06:36] perspective on why they should be
[06:37] focusing on bitcoin and Bitcoin alone
[06:39] Bitcoin first at the very least um why
[06:43] nfts and Defi and all of this other
[06:47] stuff that was going on at that time was
[06:49] something that they should spend zero
[06:52] time thinking about um and so you know a
[06:55] lot of these people come from very much
[06:58] steeped in the traditional Finance
[06:59] background uh they don't really get it
[07:01] they don't really get Bitcoin it
[07:03] certainly didn't then um but it was nice
[07:06] to be in a position where I could
[07:08] express those views that they never
[07:10] would have gotten if I hadn't been in
[07:12] that seat um and so I'd like to think
[07:14] that that I helped move their thought
[07:16] process forward as part of that and it
[07:18] was a really great experience for me to
[07:21] you know get exposure to these people
[07:23] help them hopefully improve the way that
[07:24] they were thinking about Bitcoin um as
[07:26] an asset as a money and how it might
[07:29] might ultimately affect banking in the
[07:32] future as we as we move forward and as
[07:34] Bitcoin gains adoption and then from
[07:36] there I I started just getting itchy you
[07:38] know I wanted to move on from from
[07:41] banking if at all possible and actually
[07:43] work in the space um and I found an
[07:45] opportunity with Unchained and I've been
[07:47] here almost three years now uh so it's
[07:49] it's been an incredible journey uh I
[07:52] love the team over here they are
[07:53] absolutely like top-notch incredible
[07:56] intellectual people driven like we all
[07:59] have this common Mission and purpose
[08:00] around Bitcoin and helping people to
[08:04] take control of their wealth um you know
[08:06] using self- custody methodology that
[08:09] that has inheritance planning succession
[08:12] planning in in at the Forefront of the
[08:15] way that we approach it um and then
[08:17] providing other financial services
[08:19] around making the transition from a Fiat
[08:23] denominated world to a Bitcoin
[08:24] denominated World um there's a long
[08:26] transition there I think right and there
[08:28] are a lot of tools that people need to
[08:30] be able to uh kind of straddle both of
[08:32] those worlds until Bitcoin becomes
[08:34] Global money uh at which point you know
[08:37] the the the mission of Unchained will
[08:39] evolve I imagine but we'll see we'll see
[08:41] how that plays out that's really
[08:44] interesting and and you're one of the
[08:45] best guest probably here to to ask the
[08:47] question and I have this question a lot
[08:50] of times in in my podcast I have this
[08:52] lot of times in in in my head um we have
[08:55] Banks now and uh if you want to be your
[08:58] own bank in bitco coin you have to have
[09:01] you have to get your own Keys you have
[09:03] to kind of hold your own
[09:05] keys but even in the Bitcoin Community
[09:08] right now not too many people uh take
[09:11] advantage of that opportunity I'm always
[09:13] surprised when I go out of my
[09:16] Bitcoin Core Group in my friend group
[09:19] where there are a lot of bitcoiners
[09:21] almost nobody has their own keys and if
[09:24] they have their own keys I'm a little
[09:25] bit disappointed with their setup and
[09:28] I'm always trying to push them a little
[09:29] harder to like something multi signature
[09:31] something a little bit more secure uh
[09:34] not being vulnerable if if yeah
[09:36] something happens so I'm I'm I'm I'm
[09:39] genuinely uh dissatisfied with most
[09:42] people's self- custody situation and
[09:44] most people don't even have it um so I
[09:48] would imagine most of those people are
[09:50] still kind of new to bitcoin like it
[09:52] took me a while to start to actually get
[09:54] up the learning curve enough where I
[09:56] understood that that was even something
[09:57] that I should be thinking about at all
[09:59] and then thinking about how I should be
[10:01] doing it and then thinking about like
[10:04] all of the tradeoffs that are associated
[10:05] with it and um and then really
[10:08] understanding how it worked and and then
[10:09] taking that next step which took a
[10:11] little while because you're really
[10:13] afraid that you're going to mess it up
[10:14] you know I hear these stories from
[10:16] people all the time who are relatively
[10:19] new to bitcoin they they you know right
[10:22] now the default way to get exposure to
[10:24] bitcoin is very different than it was 10
[10:27] years ago when like you basically had to
[10:29] hold your own Keys uh there weren't all
[10:31] of these other options out there for
[10:33] getting exposure to the price without
[10:35] doing that and so it was much more
[10:37] natural for for people who were actually
[10:39] that actively interested in Bitcoin to
[10:41] just go straight to holding keys because
[10:43] there was no other way but now there's a
[10:45] million different options for how you
[10:46] can get exposure to the price and and
[10:49] let's be honest exposure to the price is
[10:52] the number one reason why people adopt
[10:54] Bitcoin at first right it is absolutely
[10:57] the number one it's going to continue to
[10:58] be the number one reason and you know
[11:00] that's not a bad thing uh but it is
[11:03] something that just highlights the need
[11:05] for an evolution in people's thought
[11:07] process and one that you with your
[11:10] podcast and onchain with the content
[11:11] that we put out and so many other people
[11:13] are working on is to just make sure that
[11:16] the content and the education is in
[11:19] place so that when people are ready to
[11:20] take that next step that there's an easy
[11:23] path to make it happen that the tools
[11:26] are available for them to make it happen
[11:28] and that they have a lower chance of
[11:31] foot gunning when they take the step
[11:34] which would cause them potentially to
[11:36] just like completely turn off to bitcoin
[11:38] um you know if something devastating
[11:40] like that were to happen and they were
[11:41] to lose a lot of their wealth that
[11:43] they've accumulated in in Bitcoin terms
[11:45] so all this stuff is really important
[11:47] but I think you know I wouldn't be
[11:50] overly discouraged there I guess is the
[11:52] point right like these things take take
[11:54] time A lot of people are going to buy
[11:56] the Bitcoin ETF and then they're going
[11:57] to you know some subset of them are
[11:59] going to go down the rabbit hole and
[12:01] realize why they should be thinking
[12:03] about self- custody thinking about the
[12:05] sovereignty that it brings thinking
[12:07] about all the other benefits that you
[12:08] get from holding Bitcoin directly and
[12:11] and controlling the keys to your wealth
[12:13] there um and that subset will go on and
[12:17] our job is just to make sure that the
[12:19] path is very clear to them and how to do
[12:21] it and the tools are very very um you
[12:24] know are robust enough to make it easy
[12:27] for them they added this kind of answers
[12:30] my question a little bit already uh that
[12:32] I wanted to go in the direction um so
[12:34] you think that there's like just an
[12:36] education curve when we think back in
[12:38] the early internet days nobody knew how
[12:40] to send an email now sending email
[12:42] Sending WhatsApp sending all those
[12:44] messages it's really easy and almost
[12:46] everybody understands that that operated
[12:48] the phone um so you think that holding
[12:52] your own Keys having self- custody will
[12:55] be a normal thing that almost everybody
[12:57] does like just Sending WhatsApp messages
[13:00] and sending emails or I don't know that
[13:02] it will be normal I I think the email
[13:04] analogy is really interesting because I
[13:07] think there was a time when people
[13:10] expected
[13:12] that it would be easy for people to run
[13:15] their own email servers which in my mind
[13:17] is much more akin to what we're talking
[13:20] about here with self- custody and that
[13:22] is absolutely not the case right it's
[13:23] very difficult to run your own email
[13:24] server and there's all kinds of network
[13:27] effect around Google and and um you know
[13:30] the other major email providers that are
[13:32] out there that almost prevents you from
[13:36] being able to effectively run your own
[13:39] email server and get your messages
[13:41] through you know um and
[13:44] so so I I don't know that it
[13:47] will ever be the dominant way that
[13:50] people own Bitcoin and to some degree
[13:53] it's very difficult for that to happen
[13:55] anyway just with the construct of the
[13:57] way that Bitcoin is designed you know um
[14:00] I I think I'm
[14:03] 100% optimistic about us being able to
[14:06] expand the ability for people to uh
[14:10] control their own utxos control their
[14:12] own keys in a scalable way but that
[14:14] doesn't mean that it can scale
[14:16] necessarily to 8 billion people or 10
[14:19] billion people or 20 billion people
[14:21] which is probably the projection that we
[14:23] that we get to in the 50 years time uh
[14:25] on the globe so I think those tradeoffs
[14:28] have have to be there and there's a uh
[14:33] there's an order of operations of course
[14:35] but then there's a set of tradeoffs that
[14:37] we as a society need to make sure that
[14:40] we understand that like you want to get
[14:43] as far down the stack as you can and uh
[14:46] but it's not necessarily going to be
[14:48] achievable for everybody nor should it
[14:50] necessarily be achievable if you're just
[14:52] dealing with small amounts of money like
[14:54] it's okay to use a custodian and and all
[14:57] that if you are only dealing in small
[14:59] amounts of money I think um there's a
[15:01] lot of tools that are being built around
[15:02] like ecash and fedt and all that stuff
[15:05] that I think are going to bridge this
[15:06] Gap quite a bit and it's going to be
[15:08] really interesting to see how we evolve
[15:09] on the scalability side um it's weird to
[15:12] say because for a while I thought that
[15:15] like oh yeah we we kind of have solved
[15:16] this problem with lightning and and
[15:18] everything in terms of scalability and
[15:20] allowing people to to use Bitcoin like
[15:22] that for like Day-Day purposes but um
[15:25] I've kind of like had a reality check
[15:28] there I think in my own use of lightning
[15:31] and just how difficult it is to to
[15:32] actually like scale up to Everyday
[15:35] payments um and I think you know that
[15:38] that's like we need to continue to work
[15:41] to build those tools to make that
[15:42] available to everybody but that doesn't
[15:45] mean that it's going to be 100%
[15:46] penetration nor should it
[15:49] be yeah and I had a podcast with vicet
[15:52] uh from Twitter who who's doing a lot of
[15:54] utxo management and uh he kind of come
[15:57] to the conclusion that there will be a
[15:59] maximum of maybe 5 million maybe 10
[16:02] million maybe 15 million people
[16:04] institutions whatever are being able to
[16:07] transact base layer Bitcoin on a monthly
[16:10] basis uh because it will be just really
[16:13] expensive uh and the rest of it will be
[16:16] on on layer two layer three on on on
[16:18] Fint on whatever will be built there uh
[16:22] uh and this this is really interesting
[16:24] but even on secondly as you kind of have
[16:28] the possib to maybe have self custody on
[16:30] a second layer or have a bank on on a
[16:33] thing uh but it will be interesting to
[16:35] see where where Banks lend up uh end up
[16:37] being in the the Bitcoin world I think
[16:39] also that lending and stuff like that
[16:41] will always be the case there will
[16:42] always be be people that lend to other
[16:45] people to to make something or to invest
[16:47] something or something like that so the
[16:49] banking world is not like some Bitcoin I
[16:51] say completely
[16:53] gone uh but well you said you use the
[16:57] phrase be your own bank and that's a
[16:59] great catchphrase right but in reality
[17:02] that's not possible um because a bank
[17:05] does way more than just hold your money
[17:08] um they lend and they put deals together
[17:12] bringing Capital together to allocate
[17:14] resources across different investment um
[17:17] and and matching buyers and sellers and
[17:21] and all this stuff right they they are
[17:22] kind of like a broker for all of this
[17:24] economic activity and they're taking in
[17:26] deposits from people and and storing
[17:28] their money which we all know is is not
[17:30] really there but um you know that's only
[17:33] one small function of a bank so you can
[17:35] be your own bank to that little tiny
[17:38] slice of what they're doing but um you
[17:40] know actually performing all the
[17:42] functions of banking that are very
[17:44] beneficial for society as we U figure
[17:47] out how to allocate capital and and
[17:49] scale that Capital allocation across
[17:52] across the global economy um that stuff
[17:55] is still going to have a place for banks
[17:57] now what do banks look like
[17:59] are they going to be much smaller in
[18:02] scale on a Bitcoin standard um I would
[18:05] like to think so I I think that's
[18:07] probably true um it's I think just
[18:11] generally harder to get to massive scale
[18:14] when you have Global sound money because
[18:18] um
[18:19] the the the Fiat system kind of
[18:23] incentivizes growing companies massively
[18:27] um whereas sound money encourages more
[18:30] decentralization of the economy and more
[18:33] localization of the economy um it's it's
[18:36] harder
[18:37] to have a massive conglomerate that
[18:41] lasts for a hundred years on uh a
[18:44] Bitcoin standard because you don't have
[18:45] this like cheap financing available
[18:48] necessarily you will have cheaper
[18:50] financing as a as a major company um but
[18:53] you you don't have the ability to access
[18:56] kind of artificially cheap money in the
[18:58] markets that's being paid for at the
[19:00] expense of the rest of the economy um
[19:03] because this new money just can't be
[19:05] printed at will and into perpetuity the
[19:08] way that it can now right so um I I
[19:11] think like the structure of banking uh
[19:15] may look much more like the Wildcat um
[19:18] you know generation of Banks and I I
[19:21] think that absolutely be beneficial and
[19:23] good um but banking is definitely not
[19:26] going to go away um it it serves a very
[19:28] important function in the
[19:30] economy yeah I like that uh that that
[19:33] view it's it's more realistic and more
[19:37] uh as I think it will actually happen
[19:39] and even if if if banks get a really
[19:42] small role we have a long way to go
[19:44] there like it's it's not something that
[19:46] will will happen overnight and
[19:48] definitely not something that we even
[19:49] want to happen overnight uh because it's
[19:52] like when the Fiat system uh crashes
[19:55] down too fast this has massive
[19:57] implications on on the well-beings of of
[20:00] our loved ones that might not be as far
[20:03] but yeah it's it's I like I'm really
[20:05] interested to see I'm really interested
[20:07] to see how how the banks fall in terms
[20:10] of like the timeline of them adopting
[20:12] Bitcoin and what that looks like part of
[20:15] me thinks well they'll probably be the
[20:17] last to adopt Bitcoin because it kind of
[20:20] is direct competition for a lot of what
[20:22] they do and uh you know they have
[20:27] this favored position within the
[20:30] government that allows them to print
[20:32] money alongside the government right and
[20:34] um why would you ever want to give that
[20:36] up and start adopting Bitcoin and and
[20:39] all that but on the other hand it feels
[20:41] like there's so much opportunity for
[20:43] them because they're in that favor
[20:44] position to be able to like dominate the
[20:47] world of credit that's built on top of
[20:50] Bitcoin Bitcoin back lending is
[20:51] something that unchain has done since um
[20:53] our our founding right and um you know
[20:57] the the capital that we're able to
[20:59] source is not all that cheap for this
[21:01] because Wall Street doesn't understand
[21:02] Bitcoin we're just starting to get there
[21:04] um but as soon as the banks come into
[21:07] this they're going to be able to really
[21:09] drive down lending rates for
[21:12] bitcoin-backed loans and uh mature that
[21:16] industry and that approach to finance
[21:18] around Bitcoin in a much a much better
[21:22] way I think and it will allow people to
[21:25] get much more reach in terms of credit
[21:28] um and the banks are going to benefit
[21:29] from this because again they still have
[21:32] sit in this favored position where they
[21:33] can print money to fund loans and then
[21:36] take that collateral in in case
[21:37] something were to go wrong uh so I think
[21:40] that is inevitable that they that they
[21:42] do come into
[21:43] this but I I'm not sure what the time
[21:46] frame of that acceptance or adoption
[21:49] actually looks like I mean small comp uh
[21:52] Banks already in there and we have a
[21:54] German bank that is really active in the
[21:56] Bitcoin Community they have even like a
[21:58] bit Bitcoin conference in the German
[22:00] speaking area with like over thousand uh
[22:03] participants like they're really big on
[22:05] bitcoin but it's just a local Bank in
[22:07] Germany that they have some Bitcoin as
[22:09] in their own they they do it but not on
[22:11] a massive scale yeah um last question on
[22:14] on that banking intersection with with
[22:16] Bitcoin and you how different have you
[22:19] have you noticed any difference between
[22:21] working in that feat banking world and
[22:24] working for Unchained yeah Bitcoin
[22:26] company
[22:28] oh well yes um all of the other
[22:33] companies that I worked for before
[22:35] Unchained were big corporations right
[22:39] they're they're have thousands tens of
[22:41] thousands of people working for them um
[22:44] very long histories and all that and
[22:45] Unchained is well when I joined was
[22:48] basically still just a startup um we had
[22:50] just closed a series a uh right now
[22:53] we've we've you know closed to series B
[22:56] last year so you know a little bit more
[22:58] mature we're bigger uh and all that but
[23:01] it's still very much a growth company
[23:02] and so just the the difference in um
[23:06] approach or uh maturity of a company and
[23:10] what is built and how the processes work
[23:12] and and all that is is very different so
[23:14] that but that's natural with any kind of
[23:17] like bigger company versus a smaller
[23:19] company or a startup um but in terms of
[23:22] the culture that's built into you know
[23:25] the Fiat banking World versus Bitcoin
[23:27] it's also obviously drastically
[23:29] different right like we take a low time
[23:32] preference view on
[23:34] everything um everything is built with
[23:37] as much um ownership in mind for us and
[23:42] our processes and the way that we want
[23:44] to build tools to not create any single
[23:47] points of failure with any of the other
[23:49] like interconnections that we might have
[23:51] with other companies or other providers
[23:53] of services there and so to the extent
[23:55] that we can mitigate that we want to
[23:57] because we think of our our El as being
[23:59] here okay we're going to be here 100
[24:00] years we are going to continue to be uh
[24:03] a Pioneer and at the Forefront of
[24:05] Bitcoin adoption when it comes to
[24:07] custody and um Bitcoin integrated
[24:10] financial services and in order to do
[24:13] that we need to make sure that we own
[24:14] the infrastructure uh as much as
[24:17] possible so that if something were to
[24:18] happen um you know in The Wider industry
[24:21] we've seen some issues with this um with
[24:23] with other companies in the space and we
[24:25] don't want to be in that position right
[24:27] so a lot of that involves um you know
[24:32] approaching the the regulatory framework
[24:34] in a very different way a lot of that uh
[24:36] involves approaching the product
[24:39] development road map in a very different
[24:41] way and it's kind of like slow and
[24:43] steady wins the race um but we're going
[24:45] to be in a position where our clients
[24:47] can be very sure um that we're not going
[24:50] anywhere and that the key services that
[24:54] they depend on that they are using that
[24:56] they love so much from us are not going
[24:57] to be effective there and this this low
[25:00] time preference and you know century
[25:03] plus view of of our business and of
[25:08] Bitcoin and how that integrates it is
[25:10] just permeated throughout the culture um
[25:12] and so as I said like we have an
[25:14] unbelievably talented team over here
[25:16] like I uh am so lucky to be working with
[25:19] these people uh every single day I'm
[25:21] like Blown Away by how you know smart
[25:23] these people are and um just glad that I
[25:25] get to be around those uh that that
[25:27] thought process process and that way of
[25:29] approaching it um and I've grown
[25:30] tremendously in the way that I think
[25:32] about things as a as a result of that
[25:35] it's fascinating to see when I
[25:37] interviewed a lot of people that came
[25:39] from the fat world but are now in the in
[25:42] the in the Bitcoin World especially
[25:43] those who already have experience in the
[25:46] Fatal I mean I myself was also six years
[25:48] before in in it security has nothing to
[25:50] do with Bitcoin or Fiat but it's it's
[25:53] it's uh not Bitcoin company uh but 6
[25:56] years is not that long and other people
[25:59] have like been 10 20 years even longer
[26:01] than that being in feat and then switch
[26:04] to bitcoin and it's kind of kind of the
[26:07] same thing as what you described what I
[26:09] what I see the actual topic I think I
[26:11] think a lot of the the Fiat culture
[26:14] drives like
[26:16] this lack of wanting to be responsible
[26:19] for any kind of decision which leads to
[26:22] just stagnation and um and it's just
[26:25] this constant like cover your ass ment
[26:28] it um I don't want to be the guy who
[26:30] made the wrong decision about doing
[26:33] anything at all on a daily basis that
[26:35] would come back to bite me and lose my
[26:37] you know great benefits and all that
[26:39] kind of thing and so you know there's
[26:41] this like lack of ownership in the
[26:43] business and lack of responsibility that
[26:47] people are taking in the Fiat World um
[26:49] they don't care at all about the
[26:51] business there's no there's no passion
[26:53] there I mean now granted like I work at
[26:55] a Bitcoin company and Bitcoin is my
[26:57] passion so I'm very lucky in that in
[26:59] that regard that I get to focus on
[27:01] something that I absolutely love every
[27:02] single day but that doesn't mean that
[27:04] you can't replicate that type of
[27:07] ownership feeling in the business that
[27:09] you work for um but that typically
[27:11] happens when it's much more localized
[27:13] smaller businesses and and the further
[27:16] away you get from like the Fiat spigot I
[27:18] I think the the more you're going to get
[27:20] from that um and we see a lot of that in
[27:23] like local businesses and small
[27:24] businesses um than you do in these big
[27:27] corporate behem
[27:29] so actually the one word ownership is
[27:31] actually the when I get asked like
[27:33] what's the main thing you get away from
[27:35] all the interviews it's like ownership
[27:37] that that that's the thing like
[27:38] ownership you can get it with Bitcoin
[27:40] you can get it with all the live lessons
[27:42] uh that we learned in the in the podcast
[27:44] that's the one uh word the one thing
[27:46] that I always get away from from from
[27:48] Bitcoin um but let's move on to the the
[27:51] next topic that I actually wanted to get
[27:53] in earlier but it's it's about fire uh
[27:56] not fire the the one that burns but the
[27:59] fire financial Independence and retire
[28:01] early uh it's a fascinating community
[28:03] and it was a community that I was also
[28:05] in before Bitcoin uh and I had some
[28:09] already two podcasts around that topic
[28:11] uh and and people are really really
[28:13] looking out for those videos and and
[28:16] seeing how Bitcoin can be part of the
[28:20] fire Community or how Bitcoin is
[28:22] actually the foundation
[28:23] of financial Independence and and
[28:26] retiring earlier than than than in a
[28:29] Fiat World um explain to us like why is
[28:32] Bitcoin maybe the the best vehicle to to
[28:35] retire on or why why Bitcoin is is
[28:38] perfect for the fire Community
[28:40] also yeah well um the the fire
[28:44] Community intuitively understands why
[28:48] Bitcoin is so needed and the problem
[28:51] that it solves but they approach it in a
[28:53] different way because they haven't done
[28:55] the work of of understanding what
[28:57] Bitcoin is and why it actually solves
[29:00] the problem that they're trying to solve
[29:01] with the tools that they're using the
[29:03] the nature of money itself is something
[29:06] that they intuitively understand that we
[29:09] have this credit based money that will
[29:10] constantly be debased that you can't
[29:13] just sit on cash right if you sit on
[29:15] cash you're destined to lose purchasing
[29:17] power over time and so you and and that
[29:21] causes life to get more expensive over
[29:24] time right everybody sees this everybody
[29:26] knows that if you sit on cash over a
[29:28] 30-year period and save that uh and then
[29:31] try to pay for your kids college you're
[29:33] not going to get there right like those
[29:35] those points will never meet um same
[29:38] thing for healthare same thing for
[29:40] Education um anything that the
[29:41] government is very heavily involved with
[29:44] is going to grow uh in cost at a a
[29:46] faster rate than things that they're not
[29:48] um which is why you know we see TVs and
[29:51] and electronics and stuff that has very
[29:53] little government involvement in uh you
[29:56] know does get cheaper over time
[29:58] um at least in real purchasing power but
[30:01] these other things will they're they're
[30:04] very much necessary and they are always
[30:06] going to get more expensive and and and
[30:10] then saving as I said is not enough you
[30:13] have to invest your money or you have to
[30:16] put your money into assets that are
[30:18] going to at least keep up with the
[30:20] inflation that you're seeing in the rise
[30:22] in purchasing or in cost uh for your
[30:25] day-to-day expenses and so the way that
[30:28] the fire Community approaches this
[30:31] typically is to say okay we're going to
[30:33] buy the stock market and this is very
[30:35] use us Centric by the way so I can get
[30:37] into that a little bit more but the US
[30:39] Stock Market has this long history of of
[30:43] beating inflation of going up and and
[30:45] providing this compounding effect that
[30:47] allows you to develop a portfolio of
[30:50] assets that you can use to fund your
[30:53] retirement and if you start early enough
[30:55] and if you save hard enough and invest
[30:57] that money hard enough uh and quickly
[30:59] enough early on in life you can retire
[31:03] early like you can get to a point where
[31:04] you're 35 or 40 and you've got $3
[31:07] million in the bank U and by in the bank
[31:10] I mean invested in these liquid assets
[31:12] that you can start to draw down on and
[31:15] that $3 million will at least hold you
[31:19] over for the next 30 Years uh and most
[31:22] likely you're going to end up with way
[31:24] more than what you started with because
[31:26] of this compounding effect um and the
[31:29] benefits that have been derived from the
[31:31] fact that the US has just been the
[31:33] leader in the world in terms of
[31:35] productivity and um growth at this
[31:38] growth engine that that manifests in
[31:41] terms of the stock market and so the
[31:43] idea is okay I'm G to save um you know
[31:46] as much as I can I'm G to spend less
[31:48] than I make save the rest invest it in
[31:52] in the stock market but I'm not going to
[31:54] pick stocks necessarily I'm going to buy
[31:56] the entire market right right I'm going
[31:58] to buy the whole index so that I don't
[32:02] have to worry about timing it I don't
[32:03] have to worry about the fate of an
[32:05] individual company I'm just going to
[32:07] plow as much money as quickly as I can
[32:09] into the total stock market index and
[32:12] then I'm going to wait until I hit my
[32:14] number this number that I've uh
[32:16] calculated based on the expenses that I
[32:18] expect to have and when I hit that
[32:20] number I can retire I don't have to go
[32:22] through this like drudgery of being in
[32:24] the Fiat world and working those jobs
[32:25] that we were talking about uh where
[32:27] everybody's trying to cover their ass
[32:29] and you want to get out there as quickly
[32:31] as possible and you don't have any
[32:32] ownership there um and this is very much
[32:35] the mentality that I had before that
[32:38] like 2018 2019 time frame when I when I
[32:41] really started to understand Bitcoin um
[32:43] this is absolutely the mentality that I
[32:45] had and I I found the fire movement
[32:49] trying to scratch that itch that I had
[32:51] to say like I'm tired of coming in to
[32:54] work every day and not being fulfilled
[32:57] and I want to just like get out of here
[33:00] as quickly as possible so that I can go
[33:02] play golf on a daily basis and just do
[33:04] the things that I enjoy and and not have
[33:07] so much time and energy wrapped up in
[33:10] this place that I just don't care about
[33:11] right um and
[33:13] so by doing that it works because of
[33:16] that compounding effect although the
[33:18] rest of the world doesn't necessarily
[33:20] have access to the US Stock Market so
[33:22] that's one downside of this approach to
[33:25] to Fire and one thing that Bitcoin
[33:28] has an advantage over it is that it's
[33:30] available everywhere um you can buy a
[33:32] fraction of a Bitcoin just like you can
[33:33] buy a fraction of the stock market index
[33:35] but you can do that anywhere in the
[33:37] world because it's available everywhere
[33:38] in the world um and so Bitcoin really
[33:44] takes this approach to a whole different
[33:46] level and the reason is because there's
[33:48] a difference in framing there's a
[33:50] difference in thought process here that
[33:52] the fire movement doesn't quite get and
[33:54] that is that what you're doing when you
[33:58] take this money that you have not spent
[34:00] that you are saving and you are plowing
[34:04] it into the stock market index that is
[34:06] not actually investing that is saving
[34:09] you are saving money in a vehicle that
[34:13] allows you to not lose purchasing power
[34:15] over time uh but actually gains
[34:17] purchasing power over
[34:19] time this conflation between investing
[34:23] and saving I think is really the key to
[34:27] helping the fire Community understand
[34:30] that Bitcoin is actually a better
[34:32] vehicle for doing that than the stock
[34:34] market index when you are
[34:37] investing you are analyzing a particular
[34:39] Venture a particular company and you're
[34:41] looking at their capital structure
[34:43] you're looking at their debt to equity
[34:44] you're looking at their revenue Pro
[34:46] projections you're looking at the
[34:47] competition that surrounds them and
[34:49] you're saying okay I'm going to take a
[34:52] bet that this company is going to
[34:54] outperform relative to uh the the the
[34:59] index right because why would you buy an
[35:01] individual company if it's if you don't
[35:02] think it's going to outperform the index
[35:05] and um and I'm going to do all this
[35:07] analytical work to make sure that I'm
[35:10] allocating that Capital appropriately
[35:12] because if if I'm not willing to do that
[35:14] work then you might as well just buy the
[35:16] the index but that's not investing right
[35:19] investing is taking a an intentional
[35:22] look at a particular Venture and
[35:24] allocating Capital to that with the
[35:26] expectation that you are going to end up
[35:28] with more Capital at the endend of that
[35:30] um relative to just holding cash or
[35:33] investing in the index if you are just
[35:36] investing in the index and you've got
[35:38] exposure to the entire list of companies
[35:40] that are public you have exposure to the
[35:44] entire economy essentially which is the
[35:46] exact same thing that you get if you
[35:48] hold money you have exposure to the
[35:51] entire economy assuming that that money
[35:54] is fixed in Supply well Bitcoin happens
[35:57] to be fixed in Supply so now you can get
[36:01] access to the growth in the entire
[36:04] economy not just in the US but globally
[36:08] and you can do that in this vehicle that
[36:11] cannot be debased that cannot be
[36:14] inflated away um that will very likely
[36:19] grow much more quickly than the stock
[36:21] market even if you do have access to the
[36:23] US Stock Market you're lucky enough to
[36:24] be one of those people in the world who
[36:26] do um Bitcoin is going to grow faster
[36:29] than that because of its perfectly fixed
[36:31] Supply and the fact that it's still so
[36:33] small um so right now is like such an
[36:37] unbelievably opportune time to be um
[36:41] kind of redirecting the savings that you
[36:44] have or that you're accumulating over
[36:47] the the current time frame of your
[36:49] working life and putting that into an
[36:51] asset that is perfectly designed for the
[36:54] exact use case that you're using the
[36:56] stock market index for that has all
[36:58] these other drawbacks um that we that we
[37:00] were kind of talking about that is not
[37:02] available everywhere um and that you
[37:05] know it it still is kind of debased over
[37:08] time because there's there's more new
[37:11] companies coming in some of them are
[37:12] failing some of them are not um you
[37:14] still have the same like kind of
[37:15] volatility that's associated with
[37:17] Bitcoin um you might as well just go
[37:19] straight to the the base layer of
[37:22] getting access to the growth in the
[37:24] global economy as opposed to taking all
[37:26] this other like counterparty Risk and
[37:27] and risk of owning stocks more generally
[37:31] if you are listening to this podcast you
[37:33] might be wondering what is actually the
[37:35] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[37:37] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[37:40] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[37:41] right source and you have to store
[37:43] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[37:45] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[37:48] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[37:50] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[37:52] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[37:54] own token or something like that be on a
[37:56] Bitcoin own exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21
[38:00] Bitcoin is for me the best partner for
[38:03] that and now where do you store Bitcoin
[38:05] Bitcoin should be stored on a hardware
[38:07] wallet on a self custody solution where
[38:11] you yourself hold your keys and it
[38:14] should be a cold wallet so that's my
[38:17] Simple Solutions that's a bitbox you
[38:19] just put your Bitcoin on there back up
[38:22] your seat fras and you are better than
[38:25] 95% of all Bitcoin hard if you have more
[38:28] than ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely
[38:31] must have one last thing before we get
[38:34] back to the video I'm really passionate
[38:36] about meeting other bitcoiners and
[38:38] there's an amazing opportunity in middle
[38:40] of Europe in June the Bitcoin BR
[38:43] conference it's the best and biggest
[38:46] Bitcoin only conference in whole of
[38:49] Europe for all Americans please visit
[38:51] Europe and visit this place in June for
[38:54] all europees it's a must go anyways
[38:56] you're so close to the Bitcoin PR
[38:58] conference you basically have to come I
[39:00] will do interviews there and I would
[39:02] love to meet you all there use code
[39:05] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[39:08] discounts and use the links down in the
[39:10] description it gets interesting for me
[39:11] because I was a really big stock
[39:13] investor before I did all the anal
[39:16] analysis and I stayed up like till 1 2
[39:20] a.m. so I can listen to the American
[39:22] conference calls uh on the other side of
[39:24] the world and I did this whole game and
[39:26] I was quite successful with it uh great
[39:29] it it was also exhausting for me uh and
[39:33] then kind of in 2021 I adopted the full
[39:35] Bitcoin standard and since then I only
[39:38] invest in something that I know will
[39:41] outperform Bitcoin in the next 10 years
[39:44] and the only two things that I found
[39:45] till now this will change when when
[39:47] Bitcoin gets more and more adopted the
[39:49] only two things is right now my own
[39:50] knowledge uh and my own kind of company
[39:53] with with the podcast and everything
[39:54] that I'm starting now uh but everything
[39:58] else is in Bitcoin when I've asked
[40:00] myself the question is that company
[40:02] outperforming Bitcoin over the next 10
[40:04] years uh or is it maybe even around that
[40:07] in 10 years that company because there's
[40:09] competition there's other things
[40:10] involved in that I cannot think of of
[40:13] any company this will change over time
[40:15] when Bitcoin gets to an more mature
[40:17] State then probably I get more and more
[40:20] back in in Stock Investing because it
[40:21] gets more interesting enough uh uh then
[40:24] but this is an interesting topic because
[40:26] right now for me it's just saving
[40:29] pension planning retiring early
[40:31] everything is just on bitcoin right now
[40:33] I mean I'm 25 I'm also have like if I'm
[40:36] ending up tomorrow with zero Capital I'm
[40:39] fine I'm just as every other 25y old
[40:42] kind of but that's an interesting thing
[40:44] retiring early in Bitcoin I have one uh
[40:47] question for you on that topic I
[40:49] researched before my podcast uh started
[40:52] with you what's the average age of of my
[40:55] viewers on on this podcast uh and I came
[40:58] to know that the average age is actually
[41:00] 43 which was higher than expected
[41:02] because I'm so young but apparently the
[41:04] 43 is the average range of of of age of
[41:08] of my guest uh so assuming if if you
[41:11] want to if you not 43 and you want to
[41:14] retire with like 50s or a little bit
[41:16] earlier than usual with like 60 65
[41:19] conservatively fought what what do you
[41:21] think is the if you have now zero
[41:23] Bitcoin and you want to retire at 50
[41:26] what
[41:27] what amount of Bitcoin should someone
[41:30] save for in like seven years to I mean
[41:32] there an impossible to answer question
[41:35] but I'm curious about your thoughts on
[41:37] on how much Bitcoin you need uh to
[41:39] retiring what what's what should people
[41:41] aiming
[41:42] for so obviously everybody's different
[41:45] it's not Financial advice like all the
[41:47] normal disclaimers there um the way that
[41:50] I think about this is there's one of two
[41:53] ways to do this the first is you always
[41:56] have to start with what do you want your
[41:58] life to look like when you actually
[42:00] retire and what does your expense
[42:02] profile look like in that vision of what
[42:05] you've got for your retirement um or the
[42:08] next phase in your life right like for
[42:10] me I don't plan on retiring anytime soon
[42:14] um in the traditional sense where it's
[42:16] like okay I just stop working and then
[42:18] go play golf that's what I wanted to do
[42:19] when I was working in the Fiat world but
[42:21] now I'm lucky enough again to to work in
[42:23] Bitcoin and and work on something that
[42:25] I'm passionate about so I'm not I'm not
[42:28] going to never have an income stream and
[42:30] and do all that right like I'll get to a
[42:32] place where I can step back and not
[42:35] necessarily have like a full schedule
[42:37] every day and I can control my time a
[42:39] little bit more um but um but I'm always
[42:42] going to be working so that allows me to
[42:45] actually have a smaller number that I
[42:46] would need to get to um but I don't
[42:48] think of it that way I assume that I'm
[42:50] not going to be working because who
[42:51] knows what what might happen to my
[42:52] health or something like that and um you
[42:55] can either use like the traditional 4%
[42:58] rule where essentially what you're
[43:00] saying is okay if I've got um a certain
[43:03] amount of expenses I need 25 times that
[43:07] in a portfolio across all of my liquid
[43:09] Investments or liquid savings vehicles
[43:12] um I need 25 times my annual expenses in
[43:15] that portfolio that I'm going to draw
[43:16] down from 4% every year and in doing so
[43:21] you will very likely end up with way
[43:23] more wealth than you um than you started
[43:26] with actually and only a small
[43:29] percentage of the time according to the
[43:31] trendity study that was done and this is
[43:33] just for stock market investing um you
[43:35] add Bitcoin into the mix and it and it
[43:37] uh changes the calculation a little bit
[43:38] more um and actually maybe you're you're
[43:41] very conservative with 4% but um you get
[43:44] to a place where you can draw down on
[43:46] that portfolio over time 4% a year and
[43:49] you never run out of money essentially
[43:51] and it's able to fund all of the things
[43:53] that you would like to do within your
[43:55] retirement so you have to start with
[43:57] that foundation in place what do you
[44:00] want your life to look like and what is
[44:01] that going to cost you then from there
[44:04] you can calculate what you think you
[44:07] might need for that portfolio to sustain
[44:10] that expense level um the other way to
[44:12] think about it is okay you still need to
[44:14] start thinking about how much you're
[44:16] going to um spend but then in Bitcoin
[44:18] terms like what is what is the time
[44:22] frame that you want your Bitcoin
[44:24] portfolio to last and maybe a good
[44:28] framework here is like a 100 years so if
[44:31] there's 100 Years of um your Bitcoin
[44:36] portfolio needing to last you then maybe
[44:39] you can denominate your retirement in
[44:41] Bitcoin terms and if you get to a place
[44:44] where selling 1% of your Bitcoin every
[44:48] year will at least cover the expenses
[44:50] that you need in retirement then your
[44:52] Bitcoin portfolio will last you at least
[44:55] 100 years now
[44:57] that's assuming that the value of
[44:59] Bitcoin is not drastically going up and
[45:01] you can sell way less than that 1% at
[45:04] some point in time that's probably
[45:06] what's going to happen um so if you
[45:09] still stick to that plan and you're
[45:10] going to sell it you know 1% every
[45:12] hundred years obviously like your kids
[45:13] are going to be involved in this so you
[45:15] got to think about that but if you're
[45:16] going to sell down 1% and have your
[45:19] Bitcoin stack last over 100 years well
[45:21] that 1% is going to grow in purchasing
[45:23] power drastically so maybe by year 20
[45:26] you're still selling 1 % but now you're
[45:28] able to avoid afford this like massive
[45:31] mansion that you never even considered
[45:33] because that 1% is worth so much more um
[45:36] so if that's the case maybe 2% is a
[45:39] better is a better feel for like having
[45:42] the portfolio last 100 years um I I'm
[45:45] rambling a little bit here but the point
[45:47] is is that um there's a lot of variables
[45:49] associated with like what the valuation
[45:51] of Bitcoin is going to be what is the
[45:52] purchasing power going to be so my
[45:55] Approach is always to be very
[45:56] conservative
[45:57] um and then to uh save as much and as as
[46:02] I can to get to that goal and then then
[46:04] you can adjust as things go if you've
[46:06] got a conservative goal you hit that
[46:08] goal you can adjust as things progress
[46:12] and as the valuation changes and if
[46:14] you're like way out pacing your spending
[46:17] then you know enjoy your life a little
[46:18] bit more and spend a little bit more or
[46:21] um or not like leave a bigger nest egg
[46:24] for your kids and and have that Bitcoin
[46:27] stretch out a little bit further the
[46:28] same thing goes for a stock market right
[46:30] like if you've got a portfolio of the
[46:33] the index because you've saved it up and
[46:35] you don't want to take the tax hit or
[46:37] whatever like the same uh calculus is
[46:41] can be employed it's just that um you're
[46:44] not going to get the same type of growth
[46:47] that you do at least at this point in in
[46:49] history uh with the stock market as you
[46:52] are with
[46:53] Bitcoin yeah and I love what you said uh
[46:56] in the beginning with with not wanting
[46:58] to retire in a traditional sense because
[47:00] this is the best form of retirement you
[47:03] can have is just a job
[47:05] or thing that you're doing that you get
[47:08] paid for actually that actually fulfills
[47:09] you and actually makes you happy and you
[47:11] don't want to get away from that you're
[47:13] just like happy to do that and at some
[47:14] point you might scale it down to not 40
[47:17] hours or 60 hours a week maybe like just
[47:20] 10 hours or 20 hours whatever the the
[47:22] scaling is from that but I think that's
[47:24] the the best when you hit that Financial
[47:26] Independence number when you hit that
[47:27] Financial Independence number and you
[47:29] can actually like not worry about where
[47:33] your income is coming from then you can
[47:35] do whatever you want to do I would
[47:36] encourage you to do something productive
[47:38] and continue to like you know enjoy
[47:42] being productive in society and you can
[47:44] draw an income there that can supplement
[47:47] this and maybe allow you to not sell as
[47:49] much of your Bitcoin or your portfolio
[47:51] as you need to in order to cover that
[47:53] expense like continue to add value to
[47:56] the world please we we need your brain
[47:58] power here we need your your effort here
[48:00] societ your your grandkids will thank
[48:01] you take a low time preference view um
[48:04] but you know but man isn't it nice to
[48:09] get to a position where you don't have
[48:12] to worry about is this paycheck going to
[48:15] come in and what is that what does that
[48:17] mean to my mortgage payment or whatever
[48:19] the case is right that's what the fire
[48:21] movement is about is is getting you to
[48:23] that place as as quickly and as early on
[48:25] in life where you have these
[48:27] opportunities and options that you don't
[48:30] have if you um if you don't yet have
[48:33] that Financial Independence and I think
[48:36] the people that are in the position that
[48:38] they don't have to work but they want to
[48:40] work those are the ones who really can
[48:43] contribute in a major way to society
[48:45] because they have the the in the the
[48:48] really intrinsic motivation to do
[48:50] something even though they don't really
[48:52] need to and this is like a really cool
[48:56] uh play place to be and yeah I'm really
[49:00] cool that that we ended up with that
[49:01] kind of conclusion to that topic and one
[49:04] thing that is really important and
[49:05] you're also doing in on Unchained uh
[49:08] when you have Bitcoin is actually how to
[49:10] store the Bitcoin and the topic that I
[49:13] just got in last year in because last
[49:17] year was like a major educational year
[49:19] for me in Bitcoin um is multi signature
[49:24] uh and let's let's talk a little bit
[49:26] about why multi signature is so
[49:28] important and maybe also like what
[49:32] number of of Bitcoin or what number of
[49:35] of of US dollar equivalent of Bitcoin
[49:38] does multi signature actually make sense
[49:40] because for me there's always like
[49:41] levels to it if you have only 10 EUR in
[49:45] Bitcoin even self- custody maybe does
[49:47] not make sense just leave it on Exchange
[49:49] and when you hit like maybe a thousand
[49:51] Euros then you can move it to one wallet
[49:54] uh with like just one key and at one
[49:56] Point At what point you have to have
[49:59] like a a multi signature solution yeah
[50:01] it's it's different for everybody and I
[50:03] think there's a threshold of materiality
[50:04] that you need to determine for yourself
[50:07] um but the way that I typically answer
[50:09] that question when clients or
[50:11] prospective clients are asking
[50:13] is would you be losing a massive amount
[50:16] of sleep for this Bitcoin that you've
[50:19] accumulated um if it just went away and
[50:21] if you lost it um do you plan on is it a
[50:24] material amount to you and do you plan
[50:26] on passing it down to your family and if
[50:30] if you answer both of those questions
[50:32] yes then multi- signature is basically a
[50:34] must have right um the reason is because
[50:37] you need to be thinking about like you
[50:40] get all of these benefits from holding
[50:41] your own Keys um you get autonomy you
[50:44] get true Financial Independence in like
[50:47] a very strict sense of the word when you
[50:49] actually control your money and your
[50:51] account at a bank can't be summarily
[50:54] executed um when you need to be
[50:56] traveling around the world you can take
[50:58] your wealth with you um and and you know
[51:01] not have it kind of shut off you you're
[51:03] truly financially independent there um
[51:06] but you also need to take that
[51:09] responsibility very seriously because
[51:11] the only thing that will allow Bitcoin
[51:13] to move that you own is signatures from
[51:16] valid set of private keys and the
[51:19] traditional way of doing this is with a
[51:21] single key that protects the Bitcoin but
[51:23] that creates a single point of failure
[51:25] so you have full unilateral control over
[51:26] the Bitcoin but there are a lot of times
[51:29] when you might make one mistake and risk
[51:31] losing the Bitcoin um the dreaded $5
[51:34] wrch attack you know can can happen when
[51:37] somebody puts a gun to your head and
[51:38] says give me your Bitcoin and you it's
[51:40] pretty easy for you to do that and and
[51:43] what are you going to do if they if if
[51:45] that scenario happens and you've got the
[51:47] Bitcoin right in your house like you're
[51:48] probably going to give it to them and so
[51:50] um by introducing fault tolerance into
[51:54] your custody model you now
[51:57] make the barrier for losing the Bitcoin
[51:59] or having uh somebody steal it from you
[52:03] so much greater uh it builds resilience
[52:07] into your setup so that you can hold on
[52:09] to a material amount of Bitcoin for a
[52:11] very long time and makes the succession
[52:14] planning process much easier um the way
[52:17] that we approach this at Unchained is by
[52:19] using multisignature functionality such
[52:21] that there are three keys protecting the
[52:24] Bitcoin and any two out of the three of
[52:26] those those are needed to move Bitcoin
[52:29] um generally speaking our clients
[52:31] control two out of the three of those
[52:32] and unchain controls a third so that you
[52:35] still retain unilateral control over the
[52:37] Bitcoin but you've eliminated any kind
[52:40] of single point of failure if something
[52:42] happens to one of those two keys that
[52:43] you're controlling that you're keeping
[52:44] in two different Geographic locations
[52:46] you have not lost the Bitcoin again that
[52:49] fall tolerance is built in and Unchained
[52:52] holds that third key as a Professional
[52:54] Services firm to not only guide you
[52:57] through setting this up and
[52:59] understanding how it works and be there
[53:00] for any kind of technical questions that
[53:02] you might have going forward um but as a
[53:04] recovery mechanism if something were to
[53:06] happen to one of those two keys or if
[53:08] something happens to you so this model
[53:11] this collaborative custody model this
[53:12] multisig model lends itself very well to
[53:16] succession planning because you actually
[53:18] can provide a copy of one of those two
[53:21] keys that you're controlling to an
[53:23] estate attorney uh an executive of your
[53:25] will um a trustee a family member
[53:28] somebody who you are putting in charge
[53:31] of helping your family with a Bitcoin if
[53:33] something happens to you but you're not
[53:35] putting them in a position where they
[53:36] can run off with the funds they can't
[53:39] make one mistake and lose it because
[53:40] there is no single point of failure
[53:42] there and so multisig and this
[53:45] collaborative custody model is really a
[53:47] beautiful blend of the trade-offs of
[53:49] making sure that while you're alive you
[53:52] can retain full control over the Bitcoin
[53:54] and unilaterally spend it and you don't
[53:56] have any Reliance on on Unchained being
[53:58] even being around in order to access the
[54:00] Bitcoin but also having a plan in place
[54:03] in case you make a mistake in case
[54:05] somebody knocks on your door or in case
[54:07] something happens to you um for for your
[54:09] family to get access to the Bitcoin and
[54:11] that that inheritance and that
[54:12] succession planning again we build
[54:14] everything for uh a very low time
[54:17] preference approach um and having this
[54:20] like native functionality in Bitcoin and
[54:22] and then being able to make that
[54:24] available to our clients is a huge part
[54:26] of what attracts people to us and and to
[54:29] this model and then if you're a business
[54:31] if you're a corporation you should be
[54:33] thinking about single points of failure
[54:35] there as well right ultimately there's
[54:37] always going to be some small group of
[54:40] people that has like the the keys to the
[54:42] kingdom in terms of managing finances
[54:44] and there are various control mechanisms
[54:46] that are put in place with corporations
[54:48] or with um you know medium-sized
[54:51] businesses or even small businesses with
[54:52] just two partners um but you can protect
[54:55] the movement of Bitcoin by using
[54:57] multisig and completely eliminating a
[55:00] single point of failure there and then
[55:01] putting in some approval workflows and
[55:03] and other things on top of that to to
[55:05] make that process much more transparent
[55:07] much more controllable and um make sure
[55:10] that your business is resilient to any
[55:12] kind of issues that are doing there and
[55:15] if you still don't feel comfortable
[55:16] holding keys and having unilateral
[55:18] control over the Bitcoin or perhaps you
[55:20] can't do that multisig um lends itself
[55:24] to bring multiple custodians or multiple
[55:29] people into the mix that um again
[55:33] eliminates a single point of failure and
[55:35] has no single institution maybe in in
[55:39] control of the Bitcoin or in a position
[55:41] where if they made one mistake the
[55:42] Bitcoin would be lost so we call this
[55:44] multi-institutional custody or delegated
[55:47] Key Management um so our clients do have
[55:50] the ability to just maybe hold one key
[55:53] out of the three they're giving up
[55:54] unilateral control um but if Unchained
[55:57] holds the second key and another
[55:59] independent uh institution holds the
[56:01] third key they um they gain some
[56:04] resiliency perhaps in that succession
[56:08] planning process where they there's no
[56:11] possible way that they could make any
[56:13] series of mistakes and lose the Bitcoin
[56:15] and then you're trusting an institution
[56:17] to act in your stad there there's some
[56:19] serious trade-offs there of course right
[56:21] like there's no substitute for self-
[56:22] custody but some of our clients opt for
[56:25] that model because
[56:26] uh they value the uh institutional key
[56:31] agent relationship a little bit more
[56:33] highly than they trust themselves and
[56:35] their family to be able to manage this
[56:37] thing so ultimately it's it's based off
[56:39] of your decision-making process and
[56:40] we've got this uh gradient of options
[56:44] available to our clients to be able to
[56:46] get to a place where they're
[56:47] comfortable amazing as a great insights
[56:50] and I saw just a couple minutes before
[56:53] the podcast before we started on Twitter
[56:54] do you send a post out with like 10 tips
[56:57] for beginners something like for multi
[56:59] signature I I just saw it on my on my
[57:02] feet before iump on the I pulled up an
[57:04] old blog post that uh my friend Tyler
[57:07] Campbell who um he is the head of our
[57:10] custody Solutions our custody support
[57:13] team here um brilliant guy um is is so
[57:17] well-versed in Bitcoin private keys and
[57:19] multisig and all this stuff and he's
[57:21] been around Unchained about as long as I
[57:23] have maybe a little bit longer um and he
[57:26] put this article together just talking
[57:27] about like some things that you need to
[57:29] know when you are dealing with with
[57:32] multisig um and and a lot of it is
[57:34] Basics around just key management you
[57:36] know you can uh you can Port your
[57:38] private keys from one device to another
[57:40] like things are built in an
[57:41] interoperable way like that kind of
[57:43] thing so go yeah go check out that that
[57:46] quick thread there really really cool
[57:48] perfect um before we come to the end
[57:51] routine of the the podcast I'm curious
[57:54] about two more questions and the first
[57:56] is what are you most excited about in
[57:58] the Bitcoin community in the coming
[58:00] months years whatever you want to take
[58:03] it what am I most excited about uh I
[58:06] think this is kind of a lame answer but
[58:09] I'm just excited about the the the
[58:12] exposure that Bitcoin is going to get
[58:15] over the next few years like I've been
[58:17] around for multiple cycles and I've seen
[58:19] this play out this is the first cycle
[58:21] that I've been working in Bitcoin uh
[58:23] this is the first cycle where I think
[58:25] like a lot large amount of my friends
[58:27] and family like know that I work in
[58:29] Bitcoin know that I'm like a huge
[58:31] proponent there and I think this is the
[58:33] first cycle where we just get like this
[58:36] massive wave of adoption uh not only
[58:39] from retail but from the the
[58:41] institutional side and the price is
[58:44] going to go insane um and it's going to
[58:46] be really fun to see people actually
[58:49] start to take Bitcoin much more
[58:51] seriously like all of the the the
[58:54] foundation is set there for this uh the
[58:57] next couple of years to really bring
[59:00] Bitcoin into the national psyche it's
[59:03] going to be a topic it looks like in the
[59:05] US presidential election that's going to
[59:07] be really interesting to see how how it
[59:09] plays out but all of this is just
[59:11] bullish for awareness of Bitcoin and
[59:14] what Bitcoin really needs more than
[59:16] anything is for awareness to go up
[59:20] because anybody who is aware of Bitcoin
[59:23] um is going to eventually do a little of
[59:26] research they're eventually going to get
[59:27] a little bit of exposure they're
[59:28] eventually going to start to see the
[59:30] value of it or it's just going to be
[59:32] around them to a place where they can't
[59:34] ignore it and the the first part of
[59:38] Bitcoin adoption I think for every
[59:39] individual or every organization is okay
[59:42] I I just can't ignore this thing anymore
[59:44] right once you realize that you can't
[59:46] ignore it anymore the next step is that
[59:47] you start doing a little bit of research
[59:49] you start to understand it and when you
[59:50] start to understand it then it becomes
[59:52] something that you're interested in and
[59:54] once you're interested in it then then
[59:56] it becomes something uh assuming you
[59:58] continue down that path that is like
[60:01] something that's imperative that you get
[60:03] exposure to and once it's uh once it's
[60:06] imperative that you get exposure to it
[60:07] then it becomes like this idyllic thing
[60:11] that dominates your life until you
[60:14] obsess over it enough where the entire
[60:16] world around you is is adopting it right
[60:19] so like that it's it's a mind virus and
[60:23] the the one thing that a mind virus
[60:24] needs is hosts and the only way it gets
[60:27] host is through awareness and we we're
[60:29] just going to have this massive wave of
[60:30] awareness coming over the next couple
[60:32] years and I'm so Envy of America that
[60:35] it's already a topic at the elections
[60:38] because I'm of course I'm in Austria I'm
[60:40] in the EU I'm uh seeing the EU election
[60:43] coming through there is no word about
[60:46] Bitcoin about crypto about anything like
[60:49] that uh when it comes to the topic of
[60:51] inflation when it comes to the topic
[60:53] that things get more expensive oh
[60:55] there's war the Ukraine yes that's
[60:58] that's why we have inflation right now
[61:00] uh and and that's I'm like a little bit
[61:02] envied that I'm even listening to really
[61:04] small candidates that they probably not
[61:06] making like the 1% candidates uh and
[61:09] even those are not even even even coming
[61:13] close to the topic of of Bitcoin I have
[61:15] I had one candidate who said he wants to
[61:17] go back to hard currency but he said Not
[61:20] Gold he did not say Bitcoin he said the
[61:23] old feed currency of Austria
[61:26] we had before which was hilarious so I'm
[61:29] a little bit Envy of was it connected to
[61:31] gold I'm guessing it was a gold back
[61:33] currency yes it was more connected to
[61:37] gold before it called Shilling uh we had
[61:41] it till
[61:44] 2001 2002 or something like that uh till
[61:47] the Euro came along uh but I actually
[61:50] don't know a lot about about the history
[61:52] of the the Austrian uh currency but yeah
[61:55] it's it's it was definitely better than
[61:56] the EUR right now um the the last
[61:59] question before the end routine uh what
[62:01] are you currently uh passionate about
[62:04] besides Bitcoin like what are you into
[62:06] reading learning uh besides the whole
[62:09] Bitcoin
[62:10] thing um I spend a lot of time thinking
[62:13] about um psychology and you know I'm I'm
[62:16] in sales so a lot of like thought
[62:20] process and conversational things around
[62:23] um helping to develop relationships with
[62:25] people and um kind of enhance my sales
[62:29] process and that kind of thing so I'm
[62:30] definitely interested in that um I uh I
[62:34] play as much golf as I'm able to so golf
[62:37] is something that uh kind of operate uh
[62:40] occupies my psyche uh to a large extent
[62:42] and like if I'm scrolling on X uh it's
[62:45] like 90% Bitcoin but there's a little
[62:47] bit of golf mixed in there as well uh
[62:50] and and uh trying to to build my game up
[62:53] I have two young kids so it's very
[62:55] difficult for me to to get out on on too
[62:57] much of an occasion um but since we're
[62:59] on the topic I got to give a shout out
[63:01] to bitcoin Golf Championship um for for
[63:04] all the golfers who are out there
[63:05] listening to to Robins podcast if you're
[63:07] going to Nashville on July 24th which is
[63:11] Wednesday um before the conference
[63:13] starts uh the Bitcoin Golf Championship
[63:15] is going to happen there um it's just
[63:17] some plebs coming out to have a good
[63:19] time and meet meet other bitcoiners uh
[63:21] over golf like there's this really cool
[63:24] overlap between golf as a low time
[63:27] preference Sport and Bitcoin as a low
[63:29] time preference money um and so I I I
[63:32] like to uh you know kind of expand
[63:34] awareness of that overlap there and it's
[63:37] GNA be just a fun event so go check it
[63:38] out I love it I love it unfortunately
[63:41] Bitcoin prag uh does not have it uh the
[63:43] end routin actually is about uh that
[63:45] very topic uh what is your F like we
[63:48] have end routine where the previous
[63:49] guest is asking a question for the next
[63:51] guest uh without knowing who the next
[63:53] guest actually is uh and the question
[63:56] from the previous guest for you is what
[63:58] is your favorite Bitcoin Meetup or
[64:01] conference oh um I'm going to have to
[64:04] say TABC comp the Atlanta Bitcoin
[64:07] conference um so I live in Atlanta so
[64:10] it's nice and convenient for me but I've
[64:13] always
[64:14] had a lot of interest in understanding
[64:17] the technical sides of the way the
[64:19] Bitcoin Works um I don't hold a candle
[64:22] to a lot of people of course uh but I've
[64:24] always found it fascinating um I run my
[64:26] own node I you know obviously you know
[64:28] use my own keys and that kind of thing
[64:30] but I also like to really explore the
[64:32] the technicals ins and outs and the
[64:34] Atlanta Bitcoin conference is very
[64:37] different than other conferences it's
[64:40] very much technically focused um a lot
[64:43] of the devs around Bitcoin love to come
[64:46] to Atlanta for this conference because
[64:48] it's very much High signal around the
[64:50] technical aspects of things and so I
[64:52] always try to make it there for at least
[64:54] a day or two of the conference and meet
[64:57] some of those technical folks and really
[64:59] broaden my understanding of some of the
[65:01] key topics that people are um are really
[65:04] working on some of the new developments
[65:06] that are taking place some of the old
[65:07] developments that are evolving um it's
[65:09] just fascinating to me so I'm I'm going
