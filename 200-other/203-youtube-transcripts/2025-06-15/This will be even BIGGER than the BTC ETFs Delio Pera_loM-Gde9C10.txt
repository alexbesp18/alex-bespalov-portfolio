[00:00] I have a price for Bitcoin a very clear
[00:02] price my price for selling some Bitcoin
[00:04] is when I can get a home on at least an
[00:07] acre of land if I can trade half of
[00:09] Bitcoin or less for that that is my
[00:11] price when all of Starbucks says we
[00:13] prefer Bitcoin not now accepting Bitcoin
[00:15] but prefer Bitcoin and you see that
[00:17] prominently displayed it shows up in
[00:19] their app every time you go to order a
[00:21] coffee at Major gas station chains at
[00:23] all of Walmart on Amazon right there
[00:26] prominently displayed the very first
[00:28] payment option Bitcoin preferred if that
[00:31] happens price is going to be probably a
[00:33] lot more than $100,000 I'm guessing it'd
[00:35] be somewhere in the range of $500,000 if
[00:37] anybody thinks that they can outplay the
[00:39] S&P or the massive institutions they're
[00:42] delusional can you imagine when
[00:43] bitcoin's $500,000 when it's a million
[00:46] dollar like oh that's cool what is the
[00:47] dollar worth at that point a handful of
[00:49] people that that don't want their FA
[00:51] scene which I think is really silly like
[00:53] who are you who are you hiding from me
[00:55] what am I going to do robin what's he
[00:57] going to oh are you hiding from the Big
[00:59] Brother they know who you are we had
[01:00] written off the possibility of children
[01:02] like it's hard enough for us to get by
[01:04] we don't have a whole lot of extra
[01:05] income might be kind of dicey if we
[01:07] bring a child into the world but once
[01:09] Bitcoin came along I was like maybe this
[01:11] actually could
[01:12] [Music]
[01:15] work hi how you doing everything fine on
[01:17] your end yeah it's good uh where what
[01:20] time is it where you're at is it
[01:22] afternoon morning uh it's uh 900 p.m. in
[01:26] the night so it's getting to to the
[01:28] night time what's what's your time my uh
[01:32] it's almost noon the reason I asked is
[01:34] because you gave me a pretty big window
[01:35] and I thought well when is he waking up
[01:37] and when is he going to bed because I
[01:38] knew well I assumed I guess that from
[01:40] your accent that you're not in the US
[01:42] but there's people with all kinds of
[01:43] Accents in the US so but I think you've
[01:45] mentioned that that you're you're you're
[01:48] somewhere in the in in Europe yeah
[01:51] Austria um uh some Americans and maybe
[01:54] you can tell me also if if you feel like
[01:57] that or not because some people say to
[01:59] me that I sound like Arnold
[02:01] Schwarzenegger I personally don't hear
[02:03] it because I don't hear it because maybe
[02:05] I'm Austrian but I keep hearing it from
[02:08] uh different people I I I guess the
[02:11] accent is similar I I didn't I I I can't
[02:14] place accents well enough to to have
[02:16] said that your voice definitely isn't as
[02:19] grally or deep enough to be Arnold
[02:20] Arnold Schwarzenegger but you certainly
[02:22] sound more like him than I do can you
[02:23] hear that at
[02:25] least that that's for sure Austrian
[02:28] speaking English will always
[02:30] uh probably always uh be a little bit
[02:33] like I think this this is where it comes
[02:35] from because my audience is most in
[02:37] America and I'm Austrian and there are
[02:40] not so many famous Austrian guys like
[02:44] there are you if you there's two main
[02:47] ones that come to
[02:49] mind which ones like arold Christof W
[02:52] probably also no no the other one would
[02:54] be
[02:54] Hitler he's pretty famous when it comes
[02:57] to austrians he I got that too actually
[03:00] I I was once in Malta and I made like
[03:03] the language vacation for like four
[03:05] weeks to learn English uh and people no
[03:08] not like not people one guy came up to
[03:10] me like hey man I love you but you
[03:12] really sound like Hitler like I'm
[03:15] working on it I'm not sure what I can do
[03:17] about that sorry h no I wouldn't say you
[03:20] sound like it I I don't know gosh I
[03:22] don't even know if I've ever heard
[03:24] Hitler speak but when you're saying oh
[03:25] famous people from from Austria like
[03:28] yeah well
[03:30] there yeah yeah that's that's the whole
[03:33] like One Bad Apple One Bad Apple can can
[03:36] really I mean he ruined that mustache
[03:39] let me tell you what I don't know what
[03:40] any of this has to do with podcasting
[03:41] but I made a tweet not that long ago I
[03:44] said I really wish that Hitler would
[03:45] have worn a man bun because I hate that
[03:47] hairstyle nobody would have wear wore
[03:49] had a man bun if Hitler had one can you
[03:51] imagine man bun in that that stash never
[03:54] again just nobody with a man bun never
[03:57] would have happened oh well here we are
[04:00] he ruined he ruined the the beard this
[04:03] must yeah definitely it's also
[04:06] interesting because um that that that
[04:09] one guy can ruin so much uh even though
[04:12] it's like his beard has had nothing to
[04:14] do with what he actually it's like just
[04:17] because you you have to be it does not
[04:19] mean that you go ahead and and do all
[04:21] this negative stuff and all this bad
[04:23] stuff so it's like interesting how they
[04:25] connect like oh you have to be like oh
[04:27] are you are you a fan of him or like
[04:29] what what's what's going on with you
[04:31] yeah I don't I've never once seen
[04:33] somebody with that mustache but I I can
[04:36] imagine if you did they might go like no
[04:39] no no I'm I'm a Charlie Chaplain fan or
[04:41] I I I I do impersonations of Charlie
[04:44] chap like boy have there's so many other
[04:46] people that you could do impersonations
[04:48] of have you considered trying anyone
[04:51] else makes me wonder is if there is
[04:53] there a look I'm trying to think of
[04:56] any Unique Look in big and I mean I mean
[05:00] something that really stands out every
[05:02] if you want to get pedantic every single
[05:04] human being on the planet has a unique
[05:07] look but is there anyone in
[05:10] Bitcoin that has a look or wears a shirt
[05:15] or something that could then go and do
[05:17] something so atrocious that nobody in
[05:19] Bitcoin that was aware of that person
[05:21] would go oh we're never
[05:24] wearing whatever or doing that hairstyle
[05:27] or something like that I I can't think
[05:28] of anybody that has something that
[05:31] is really identifiable with with them
[05:36] there's there's no hairstyle or
[05:38] something like sailor I he's just a an
[05:41] an elderly is what is he 50 or 60 years
[05:44] old white guy with a general white look
[05:47] like he doesn't have some sort of
[05:48] specific jacket or shirt or or anything
[05:51] the only person that I can think that
[05:53] has somewhat of a uniform is Peter
[05:55] McCormack he's got that hat that says
[05:58] azat mazad or something something like
[05:59] that I don't even know what it means I
[06:01] think I've looked it up and it's just
[06:02] some random company and
[06:04] I okay has it mod or I don't I don't
[06:08] know but he wears that a lot but that's
[06:09] the only thing that I can think of I
[06:10] don't know this is stupid this is
[06:12] pointless this has nothing to do with
[06:13] anything you asked me what I or asked
[06:15] you what what we wanted to talk about
[06:16] and I said that um I keep looking for an
[06:20] oh [ __ ]
[06:21] moment and what I I guess I can expand
[06:25] on
[06:26] that I I'm under the impression that
[06:29] most people watch sailor interviews like
[06:33] yours or anyone's it or let me rephrase
[06:36] this I'm under the impression that
[06:38] anybody watching a sailor interview is
[06:40] probably already in
[06:42] Bitcoin I'm sure there are exceptions to
[06:46] that you see the numbers that a sailor
[06:48] interview pulls and so if it's an
[06:50] especially good one or he makes an
[06:53] especially interesting or easy to grasp
[06:57] point then almost certainly that point
[07:00] that he makes that specific minute two
[07:03] five whatever it is will get clipped and
[07:06] then sent out to other people I know
[07:08] that I have sent some very Clips like
[07:10] that to my dad like oh here he is
[07:12] explaining this thing here here check
[07:14] this out and people are that are deep
[07:16] into Bitcoin that want to help other
[07:17] people which I think is more common when
[07:21] you first get into Bitcoin and how long
[07:23] that phase lasts depends on the person
[07:26] but you go oh
[07:29] I had such difficulty myself
[07:31] understanding this thing and I had all
[07:32] these questions here is somebody that is
[07:35] far richer than me which I think is what
[07:37] people pay to pay attention to first and
[07:39] foremost with sailor look how wealthy he
[07:41] is and look what he's doing with his
[07:43] money if this super rich guy is doing
[07:46] this with his money then maybe it's a
[07:47] really good idea for me to do it with my
[07:49] money too I think that's what stands out
[07:51] first and then secondary but also quite
[07:55] important is oh and he can speak in a
[07:57] way that almost anybody can understand
[08:00] there are certain people like Lyn Alden
[08:02] I have no idea what she's saying 85% of
[08:05] the time I I I have no [ __ ] clue what
[08:09] she's saying I I None absolutely none
[08:12] same with Luke groman uh Joe
[08:16] kosari
[08:18] um who else there's some of these macro
[08:21] people out there that I'm just like I
[08:23] have no idea what the Futures and this
[08:26] and when the yield Swap and this and
[08:28] they're all just like nodding with each
[08:29] other there was a chat that um Natalie
[08:32] not Natalie Portman that'd be funny if
[08:34] she got into Bitcoin uh Natalie Brunell
[08:36] had with uh uh Preston pish I don't know
[08:40] what the the G's name is she's a she's a
[08:41] dentist or was a dentist she lives in
[08:43] Hawaii with her husband who is also a
[08:45] dentist and they were trying to do some
[08:46] volunteer work over there and then um
[08:49] they had a special guest was a to Troy
[08:53] tro maybe I can find it here as as I
[08:55] chat but they got to a point where one
[08:59] of them was describing something about
[09:02] the
[09:03] way they were talking about the price
[09:05] suppression or is price suppression
[09:06] happening and how does this work and and
[09:08] what's going on with with the market and
[09:10] the Futures and this and and it went
[09:12] completely over my head I had no idea it
[09:15] was uh Preston pish James lavish Dr
[09:17] Susie Riley and then they had a special
[09:20] guest of here Luke growman there we go I
[09:23] had no idea what they were talking about
[09:25] most of the time no idea when Susie is
[09:27] there talking about trying to volunteer
[09:28] and do this oh okay I can understand
[09:30] those things those are words that I
[09:31] understand in my head but when they're
[09:33] talking or James was there saying that
[09:36] these large institutions the headed
[09:38] hedge funds that it's this thing that he
[09:40] did back in the day and they they get
[09:41] 10% when they they do the Futures and I
[09:44] have no idea I have no idea so the
[09:46] reason I went on this rabbit hole is
[09:48] because when sailor doesn't speak that
[09:51] way and he goes if you have three tuna
[09:54] sandwiches and Bob wants two tuna
[09:56] sandwiches well the price of the tuna
[09:58] sandwiches are going to go up most any
[10:00] idiot can I understand that I don't
[10:03] really like tuna but yeah that makes
[10:05] sense and he speaks in a way
[10:08] that really you'd have to be
[10:12] borderline like you know not not well
[10:16] mentally to not understand what what
[10:19] sailor is saying and that's appealing
[10:22] people like somebody that you can
[10:24] understand but I take a lot
[10:28] of M I was going to say hope that's not
[10:31] the right word I I um I guess it helps
[10:34] me sleep better at night when there are
[10:36] people like James lavish and Preston
[10:39] pish and Luke groman talking about these
[10:41] things in a way that unless it's all a
[10:44] big act but they certainly seem to know
[10:46] what they're talking about they they've
[10:49] got the ACT down pat and they all use
[10:51] the same vocabulary and they say the
[10:54] same things again and again and again in
[10:56] different places to different people
[10:57] that makes me go okay they're
[11:00] just they they have seeped themselves in
[11:03] a world that I have not and the same
[11:05] would be true of me not understanding a
[11:07] rocket scientist or a mechanic talking
[11:09] about working on the undercarriage of a
[11:12] Toyota Camry he's going to be you
[11:13] throwing around words and phrases and
[11:15] tools that I probably have never heard
[11:17] of some of it I'm going to pick up
[11:19] little pieces like oh okay I I know what
[11:21] that I know what a wrench is I know what
[11:24] he just described there left turn
[11:26] right-handed left I know what those
[11:28] things are but then when he gets into
[11:29] the Deep weeds of how the undercarriage
[11:32] fits to the chassis and then the muffler
[11:34] system sure I I'm I'm glad you know what
[11:37] you're talking about because I'm going
[11:38] to have to take my car to a mechanic so
[11:39] I I hope he knows what he's
[11:41] doing but I take it it helps me that you
[11:45] have extremely smart people sure seems
[11:48] like it in the Bitcoin space interested
[11:51] in Bitcoin speaking positively about
[11:53] Bitcoin and on the flip side the People
[11:57] speaking positively about pretty much
[12:00] every other crypto are obvious morons
[12:06] like
[12:07] clearly [ __ ] [ __ ] idiots it
[12:11] starts with their profile pictures it
[12:14] seems
[12:15] like 65 80% of the time it's a little
[12:19] cartoon something from some nft that's a
[12:22] monkey this or a penguin
[12:24] or some anime something or another so
[12:28] they're
[12:30] I was about to say hiding behind a mask
[12:33] maybe it's not hiding maybe maybe they
[12:34] take pride in it and they they're
[12:36] they're more than happy to share a
[12:37] picture of thems but it seems as though
[12:39] the people in Bitcoin there there are
[12:42] people that have that are Anonymous or
[12:45] synonymous but many people I don't I
[12:49] don't know if I can say the majority but
[12:50] at least the majority of the people that
[12:51] I follow use an actual picture of thems
[12:54] they actually go on there's only a
[12:57] couple that I can think of in the
[12:58] Bitcoin space that don't put their face
[13:00] out there you've got
[13:03] um Gigi you you've got uh uncle uncle
[13:08] Dev you've got the rational root
[13:12] Satoshi a few a handful of people that
[13:15] that don't want their face scene which I
[13:17] think
[13:17] is really silly like who are you who are
[13:20] you hiding from me what am I going to do
[13:23] robin what's he going to what the [ __ ]
[13:25] do we care oh are you hiding from the
[13:28] Big Brother they are know who you are
[13:29] you're not hiding from Big Brother
[13:31] you're not hiding from the NSA or the
[13:32] CIA what what are you
[13:35] doing okay I I if it's fun for you then
[13:40] oh okay oh yeah then have fun like this
[13:43] the the rational root guy he went out
[13:44] and had a carrot mask made and it's it's
[13:46] kind of like a DJ type thing so he
[13:48] enjoys doing that great Satoshi I have
[13:51] an exceptionally low opinion of I think
[13:53] he's a blithering [ __ ] idiot with the
[13:55] way that he presents himself but if he
[13:57] has fun have fun I I like it when people
[14:00] have fun I I like having
[14:02] fun but that you don't have sailor doing
[14:05] that you don't have James leish or luk
[14:06] grman or so many of these other people
[14:08] makes me go okay these are some smart
[14:10] people this helps and I started all this
[14:14] with Len Alden and not understanding
[14:15] what what she's saying and doesn't
[14:18] really matter too much to me that I
[14:19] don't understand what she's saying if I
[14:21] really put the effort to get deep into
[14:24] macroeconomic stuff I think that I could
[14:26] understand it but when sailor comes
[14:27] along to bring this all background to
[14:29] where I started and says something that
[14:33] any idiot can wrap his head around then
[14:35] that gets shared but the vast majority
[14:38] of people listening to sailor are
[14:40] already in Bitcoin because I
[14:42] think I think that most people that are
[14:46] into bit deep into Bitcoin not oh yeah
[14:48] sure I have some Bitcoin and I have some
[14:50] salon and I have some of this and I have
[14:51] some of the this other one yeah I've
[14:53] dabbled with nfts no no no not not those
[14:55] people I mean the people that are go oh
[14:57] I've read multiple books I've listened
[14:59] to dozens if not hundreds of podcasts I
[15:02] have a large section if not the majority
[15:06] of my network in Bitcoin I am deep deep
[15:09] deep in this thing I think that the
[15:12] reason because this I'm basing this off
[15:14] of my own reason that those people like
[15:17] myself I'm one of those people listens
[15:20] to more and more of these podcasts is
[15:22] because we're wondering am I an idiot am
[15:25] I not seeing something here we see the
[15:28] people that for the hexic scam we see
[15:30] the people that fall for this or get
[15:32] wrapped up in some pyramid scheme and we
[15:35] go we're constantly taking a hard look
[15:37] in the mirror and going is that is that
[15:39] me is that what Bitcoin is I I don't
[15:42] think it is I've looked at it I've asked
[15:44] every hard question that I can think of
[15:46] and every single one of them has an
[15:48] answer which is weird and I I but maybe
[15:52] maybe I should just be trying to put
[15:55] more money into GameStop or or Nvidia
[15:58] that's doing that's clearly doing really
[15:59] well is AI the future I don't
[16:02] know it seems like it's got some good
[16:04] stuff but it also seems like it's got
[16:06] some really stupid stuff and and we see
[16:08] all these examples coming out of Google
[16:09] that Google's doing horrible really
[16:12] completely ass backward stuff with AI so
[16:15] is that the future I I don't want to be
[16:17] a part of that future so even if it is
[16:19] going to make me a lot of money I'm not
[16:20] sure that I want to put my money into a
[16:22] company that's helping that I don't I
[16:23] don't want to help further that outcome
[16:25] so I don't know boy what where do I put
[16:27] my money because really at the end of
[16:29] the day I would just like to have some
[16:31] more time with my friends and family and
[16:32] not have to work every single hour of
[16:35] the day until I'm 90 years old and just
[16:38] die from exhaustion oh we've seen the
[16:39] meme where the baby's born on the
[16:41] conveyor belt blah blah blah D and
[16:43] dumped into the grave is that me I don't
[16:44] want that to be be me and I'm hoping
[16:46] this Bitcoin thing allows that allows me
[16:49] to escape that whole chain of things
[16:52] happening but maybe it's just another
[16:55] piece of this crazy puzzle that we call
[16:57] life I I don't know I have no idea but
[16:59] here's sailor and he's making a lot of
[17:01] sense and he's putting a [ __ ] ton of his
[17:03] money into this thing ah boy please help
[17:06] me think and realize that I'm not a
[17:08] [ __ ] but for all that and to my
[17:11] bringing this again back around to what
[17:13] I said to the tweet I don't think that
[17:15] sailor is going to be the one in a
[17:18] direct way that orange pills the world
[17:22] and what I mean by in a direct way is
[17:24] sailor's adoption acceptance Etc of
[17:28] Bitcoin his his push behind it as easy
[17:31] to understand as he is I don't think is
[17:33] going to make huge swas of people just
[17:37] go click oh my goodness oh my goodness
[17:41] this is something that I need to pay
[17:42] attention to what I think will cause
[17:45] that click oh oh I think I I should at
[17:48] least maybe check this out is when all
[17:52] of Starbucks says ex prefer we prefer
[17:57] Bitcoin not now accepting Bitcoin but
[17:59] prefer Bitcoin and you see that
[18:01] prominently displayed it shows up in
[18:03] their app every time you go to order a
[18:05] coffee at a at Major gas station chains
[18:09] at at at all of Walmart at on Amazon
[18:14] right there prominently displayed the
[18:16] very first payment option Bitcoin
[18:19] preferred if that happens then people
[18:22] you log into Amazon wait I'm sorry is
[18:24] this a joke what is I thought that bit
[18:28] thing was wait really but for it to get
[18:32] to that point it wouldn't just happen
[18:33] overnight out of the blue oh Jeff Bezos
[18:35] goes hey let's just do this there's
[18:37] going to be steps that get there and
[18:39] it's going to be talked about and the
[18:40] price is going to be probably a lot more
[18:42] than $100,000 I'm guessing it'd be at
[18:44] for that to happen somewhere in the
[18:46] range of 500,000 and when then Apple is
[18:49] going like we preferred preferred
[18:51] preferred it none of these things happen
[18:54] overnight
[18:55] what is more likely to happen is that
[18:58] somebody like Michael Dell of Dell
[19:00] computers is having a chat with sailor
[19:02] in the background that's why I say that
[19:04] I don't think what sailor is doing is
[19:05] going to happen in a forward- facing way
[19:08] what I think is happening is that you
[19:09] have a billionaire probably having
[19:12] conversations I I have to assume that
[19:15] some people out there with huge amounts
[19:17] of sway like a Michael Dell like Jeff
[19:21] Bezos is seeing what what what um what
[19:25] sailor has done and going it's at least
[19:27] worth paying attention to I let's let's
[19:31] see what happens here and is it worth
[19:35] mimicking at this point when Bitcoin
[19:37] can't seem to break past the the 60
[19:39] range and it tickled the bottom half of
[19:42] of 74 a little while maybe these large
[19:46] institutions these big companies are
[19:48] waiting to see hey let's see what the
[19:50] nation states do which is weird because
[19:52] usually you private companies wouldn't
[19:55] wait for what a nation state was going
[19:57] to do but maybe they they want to see
[19:59] more favorable regulatory Frameworks to
[20:02] go well okay hey if uh if Qatar or these
[20:05] oil Rich nations are going to start
[20:07] their their sign is going to be Bitcoin
[20:09] preferred well then yeah maybe we should
[20:11] we should we should follow that but when
[20:15] it hasn't really done yeah you could say
[20:18] oh well over the past year it's up more
[20:19] than 100% all right cool yeah great but
[20:23] it hasn't broken its all-time high you
[20:26] could say yeah yeah it did it last time
[20:28] around was at 69 whatever or 68,000 and
[20:31] and it hit what 72 73 all right yeah but
[20:34] adjusted for inflation I think people
[20:36] can feel in their gut H it's kind of did
[20:38] about the same thing and really it
[20:39] really didn't I think that it needs to
[20:41] break 80 for people to go oh okay well
[20:45] now now it's doing something interesting
[20:47] is that gonna happen this year I don't
[20:48] [ __ ] know I'm at the point in my
[20:51] Bitcoin cycle where I don't really care
[20:54] I I my my favorite phrase that I've come
[20:57] up with to describe Bitcoin is I am 100%
[21:00] convinced that our current monetary
[21:02] system is [ __ ] beyond all repair I
[21:05] that that I'm convinced of as much as
[21:07] I'm convinced that the sun will rise
[21:09] again tomorrow and that if I were to sit
[21:11] on the sun it wouldn't go well for me
[21:13] not not a good outcome that I'm
[21:15] convinced of monetary system
[21:18] screwed I don't know if Bitcoin is the
[21:21] answer that fixes all this but I don't
[21:22] know of something better I don't think
[21:25] gold does it I don't think silver does
[21:26] it I don't think any of the other
[21:28] shitcoins do it I I I certainly don't
[21:32] see any government or many of them
[21:37] getting back onto a a sound money
[21:39] standard what what mle is doing in
[21:41] Argentina is kind of unheard of you
[21:45] don't usually see somebody get into
[21:47] power and just start
[21:49] chopping agencies off left and right I
[21:52] mean that maybe a little bit oh we're
[21:54] going to reduce the number here by 5%
[21:57] but not just in
[21:59] all of it these studies this this what
[22:02] just no more of this entire division
[22:05] that's that's wild but I've been
[22:07] chatting for 20 minutes do you have any
[22:10] questions for me h a lot along the ways
[22:15] and the moment where I wanted to to
[22:17] scream out was when you said about Linn
[22:19] alen because I always felt the same way
[22:23] like I can listen to saor for hours to
[22:26] Jeff poof for hours to all those people
[22:28] for hours because I feel like I learned
[22:31] something and still I understand it if I
[22:36] listen to Linn alen for an hour I
[22:38] usually click out after like 10 minutes
[22:40] because I'm like I have I I have no clue
[22:43] where we are yeah yeah I have no clue
[22:46] what she is saying um but it seems like
[22:50] are you are you disappointed a little
[22:52] bit with with Bitcoin or is is Bitcoin
[22:54] not where you want it to
[22:57] be no I don't I don't really care
[22:59] because like I said I don't know what
[23:01] else I would be putting my money into I
[23:05] I need so I guess I've I've got in my
[23:07] mind there's a lot more options than
[23:09] than this but in my mind there are three
[23:11] options that I can do with my money and
[23:14] before I even learned about Bitcoin
[23:17] there was only two options and one of
[23:18] them was kind of I don't really
[23:20] understand that so the first option is
[23:21] just saving I just I I get a paycheck
[23:24] and I put some of that into my savings
[23:26] account and I and I try not to look at
[23:28] when I check my my account balance I go
[23:30] no I I don't really I do have that yes
[23:32] but that's for a rainy day and the first
[23:35] time I ever do this it's $100 and then
[23:37] at at the end of the year maybe I I get
[23:39] it up to 5,000 or $10,000 if I'm really
[23:43] doing well and and not going with any
[23:45] frivolous expenses saving $10,000 any
[23:48] year for me in my income would be
[23:51] challenging but probably doable if I was
[23:53] really really Frugal um and so that's
[23:56] option one just just saving money but
[23:58] that's difficult because you see this
[24:00] number getting bigger and bigger and
[24:02] bigger and at least for me when I see a
[24:04] monetary number getting bigger and
[24:05] bigger and bigger I just go oh look at
[24:08] all the look at all the neat stuff that
[24:09] I can get I can't turn that that part of
[24:11] me off maybe some people can they go oh
[24:14] I really enjoy saving and I like seeing
[24:17] that number get bigger and for me not
[24:19] for me but for the person I'm I'm I'm
[24:22] parting here that that's where I get
[24:24] enjoyment but I I have a spending
[24:26] problem maybe it's because I I kind of
[24:28] grew
[24:29] up H I wouldn't say poor there was
[24:31] always food on the table but we weren't
[24:33] we were certainly on the the lower end
[24:35] of of a middle class household for sure
[24:39] I'm one of five children so unless your
[24:41] your parents are making huge and my my
[24:43] mom was a stay- atome mom so I we were
[24:45] living off of one income which was
[24:47] possible back in even the 80s uh and
[24:49] into the 90s anyhow that's option one
[24:51] just save well that's hard option two is
[24:55] do something with your money and this is
[24:57] where safe aine talks about well and now
[24:58] you have to have a a day job but then
[25:00] also you've got to research all these
[25:02] various companies there's a thousand
[25:05] plus companies 10,000 companies that you
[25:06] can invest in which is the right
[25:09] one I don't know do you no of course not
[25:13] there's only seven or 10 that are
[25:14] profitable on the S&P 500 which is why
[25:16] people invest in the whole damn S&P 500
[25:18] but why not just invest in the right
[25:20] ones that would be even better wouldn't
[25:21] it well sure it would but which are the
[25:22] right ones this year this month I don't
[25:26] know I don't know and and if anybody
[25:28] thinks that they can outplay the S&P or
[25:31] the massive institutions they're
[25:34] delusional or an they're either a d
[25:37] delusional which is 99.9% of them or an
[25:40] absolute genius and is probably doing
[25:42] something else with his time but if you
[25:45] can beat the S&P 500 hey godspeed but if
[25:49] the hedge funds and all these
[25:51] institutions these massive players that
[25:53] have bajillions of dollars okay that's
[25:55] not a real number but literal billions
[25:57] and in some cases trillions of dollars
[25:58] to throw around and they can't do
[26:01] it how are you going to do it you're not
[26:05] you don't have their infrastructure you
[26:06] don't have their tools that this this is
[26:09] the entirety of what they do you're off
[26:11] doing your day job and you can listen to
[26:14] a podcast here and there on your commute
[26:15] you're going to outplay them no you're
[26:17] not no you are not this is like you
[26:19] saying oh I am going to load up my glock
[26:23] click click and I'm going to go and
[26:25] solve the war in Ukraine and Russia I'm
[26:27] going to do it no no you're not no
[26:29] you're not you'll go over there if you
[26:30] can even get over there and you will die
[26:32] that's the first thing that that will
[26:33] happen you'll get out to the front line
[26:35] and a drone will smack you in the head
[26:36] with a bomb strap to it and you're dead
[26:38] and now maybe if you're lucky you're a
[26:40] Twitter video then that's how people
[26:42] remember you the guy that was a [ __ ]
[26:44] [ __ ] that went on and took on a massive
[26:47] war and died that was you good job you
[26:50] took on the hedge funds and The
[26:51] Institute and Citadel and black rock and
[26:53] and you have zero dollars now and there
[26:56] is all sorts of these stories on wall
[26:58] Street bets where people like oh Yol
[26:59] load into this life savings grandma left
[27:01] me $10,000 I'm going to put it in one
[27:03] 123 stock and now you have no dollars
[27:06] good job or you owe them money because
[27:08] you did some really cute stuff with
[27:10] Futures and shorts and things that well
[27:12] I don't understand it and I'm not the
[27:15] biggest [ __ ] on the planet and these
[27:17] people that are on Reddit well you're on
[27:19] Reddit so you're you're a bigger [ __ ]
[27:21] than I am and you did what with your
[27:23] money oh okay yeah you deserve to have
[27:26] zero dollars or negative dollars and
[27:28] then the last thing is once you find out
[27:30] about it Bitcoin or some other crypto I
[27:33] guess I guess there's gold and stocks in
[27:35] there but that that that all plays into
[27:36] that second point of which is the right
[27:37] thing to put your money into and so am I
[27:40] concerned this is a long [ __ ] answer
[27:42] but am I concerned or or bothered with
[27:44] what what Bitcoin is doing no because I
[27:46] don't know what else I would do with it
[27:48] and the nice thing about Bitcoin is that
[27:50] once you get to a deep understanding of
[27:53] it or deep enough whatever enough means
[27:56] there you just sit on it and forget
[27:58] about it and because it's in Cold
[28:00] Storage at least for me it's a hell of a
[28:03] lot harder to spend I can't just go tap
[28:06] tap transfer from savings into checking
[28:08] now I'm on I went to the gun store and
[28:11] bleep bloop bloop I bought myself a new
[28:14] riful there that W There Goes My $10,000
[28:17] savings well whoopsy do Great I I I
[28:21] can't do that I'd have
[28:23] to go boot up the my specific computer
[28:27] that is only used for Sparrow it's never
[28:29] gone online for anything ever that
[28:31] that's the only program it has on it I
[28:34] have to boot that up type in my password
[28:37] to get into Sparrow see which of my
[28:40] wallets well I guess it'd be the only
[28:42] one on there I'd have to then transfer
[28:44] that money using my multisig thing so
[28:46] I've got to go and dig out multiple
[28:48] wallets at least two of them or C the
[28:51] signing devices that that I've got send
[28:54] some of that Bitcoin to something like
[28:58] cash app or some other River or
[29:00] something like that then sell that all
[29:03] the while knowing what I'm doing every
[29:05] step of the way that I'm about to do
[29:07] this what are you doing what are you
[29:08] doing having this little voice going
[29:09] what are you doing what dude what are
[29:11] you what are you doing and knowing that
[29:13] I'm going to take a hit for capital
[29:15] gains I'm gonna have to pay on this like
[29:17] it's so much more of a headache to get
[29:20] that money and turn it into USD which
[29:22] I'm glad about some people like see look
[29:24] that's a terrible thing about Bitcoin no
[29:26] no that's a really good thing as far as
[29:28] I'm concerned with Bitcoin it makes it
[29:30] much harder for me to just spend it
[29:31] willy-nilly so I'm glad that I just sit
[29:34] on and forget about it and even where
[29:36] it's at right now I'm up more than more
[29:40] than 2x because when I got into it
[29:44] was at least in this last cycle the best
[29:46] time that I could have I got in when it
[29:48] was down into the the the like the very
[29:50] bottom the the 15 to 20 range is where I
[29:53] was getting in because I was paying
[29:54] attention to it right about that time I
[29:56] was like all right well I've seen that
[29:58] gone down and one thing that I'd learned
[30:01] from listening to all sorts of different
[30:02] investing things before I got into
[30:04] Bitcoin was like I started getting to
[30:05] investing and learning about it with the
[30:07] GameStop thing but I saw that when I was
[30:09] at the top and I had at Le at least
[30:12] enough wherewithal to go well if
[30:13] everybody else is in it already then I
[30:15] missed a boat I I can at least know that
[30:17] and I I certainly had because by the
[30:19] time that I was even paying attention
[30:20] about it oring hearing about it it was
[30:21] at the 200 range and yeah it went up to
[30:23] about 300 but then it's just been down
[30:25] ever since so I'm I didn't I didn't get
[30:27] that one and I'm glad I didn't get on
[30:28] that boat um but it led me down leading
[30:33] to learn about
[30:34] Bitcoin and then
[30:36] um oh I lost my train of thought shoot I
[30:40] was doing pretty well there
[30:41] too uh I'm I'm super impressed uh by the
[30:46] way I the last podcast I you kind of
[30:48] remind me of the guys
[30:50] one uh the guys one I also had on and
[30:53] and and he is just this amazing drain of
[30:55] thoughts where he like gets back to his
[30:58] original point but he makes this like
[31:01] small Adventures along the way and it's
[31:04] really interesting to to hear it and I
[31:06] love how you do it uh and and and really
[31:09] cool H I was talking about oh sell
[31:12] selling some Bitcoin and doing that
[31:14] that'd be a big pain in the
[31:16] butt I think was and you were talking
[31:18] about that uh the third option with
[31:20] Bitcoin it's way harder to get uh to
[31:23] your Bitcoin and that's how you prevent
[31:25] yourself basically to to spend it and
[31:28] and that's how you and also I never
[31:30] thought about that but uh it's it's also
[31:33] pain in the ass for me to get my actual
[31:36] stack of Bitcoin because I have some
[31:38] like in in a hot wallet I have some
[31:40] really small portion in like a lightning
[31:42] wallet and something like that but like
[31:45] 99.999% of my Bitcoin stack is really
[31:47] hard reachable even for me like yeah uh
[31:50] good luck for anyone else to to get it
[31:52] but for for me personally it's it's
[31:54] really hard uh I have to do something
[31:56] for that uh and and uh I don't consider
[32:01] that number to be my net worth and when
[32:04] I go on and uh look for like oh I could
[32:07] buy that and then I look at my bank
[32:09] account I'm like oh I cannot buy that
[32:12] yeah I cannot uh I could buy that maybe
[32:16] when I sell all my Bitcoin but it's not
[32:19] even in my question like it's like of
[32:21] course I don't sell my Bitcoin it's not
[32:23] even I don't even think about touching
[32:25] my Bitcoin because there's a barrier and
[32:28] I'm was aware of of of that asset and my
[32:31] my question in my mind was like why
[32:34] aren't more people figuring that out or
[32:37] maybe it maybe it's even good that uh
[32:40] Bitcoin takes a while to
[32:42] understand um I'll I'll come to my
[32:44] thought on that here in a second because
[32:46] I remembered where I was going so I was
[32:47] saying about when I got into Bitcoin and
[32:48] that it was down and it's been up since
[32:50] then so I feel pretty good that it's at
[32:52] 60 considering I got in in the 15 to 20
[32:54] range and I'm I attribute getting
[32:57] getting in then after it gone down I
[32:59] imagine some people that you'd see see
[33:02] that Meme it's like oh it's at 60 60,000
[33:04] I'm not buying that's too expensive and
[33:06] then it drops down to 30 it's like well
[33:07] I'm not buying it dropped down to 30 I'm
[33:09] not buying it why would I buy it if it
[33:11] dropped down but I had watched enough
[33:14] podcasts with traditional investors like
[33:17] Bill Aman where I learned two important
[33:20] things there never make investments with
[33:23] emotions and buy when something is down
[33:27] and so once I
[33:28] had what I felt was a decent
[33:29] understanding of Bitcoin I thought oh oh
[33:31] this thing's on sale it's down from the
[33:34] the all-time highs that it was at at
[33:36] 68,000 down to 15 20 now hell yeah we're
[33:39] scooping some of this up oh heck yeah
[33:41] maybe it'll go lower whatever this is a
[33:43] great bargain from where it was and that
[33:45] turned out to be exactly accurate and I
[33:47] think will turn out to be astoundingly
[33:50] accurate and I think where it's at now
[33:52] will be an absolute brain-numbing
[33:53] bargain compared to where it many people
[33:56] foresee it going in the not so distant
[33:59] future but as to why more people don't
[34:02] see it I don't think they have the time
[34:05] I do not think they have the time if you
[34:07] are on bitcoin Twitter then yes much of
[34:10] your Twitter feed will look like there's
[34:12] so many people in Bitcoin and there's a
[34:14] lot of people that are in this thing
[34:16] together with me but that is an absolute
[34:20] minuscule drop in the bucket of all of
[34:23] Twitter if you step outside that for a
[34:25] second and you look at what's trending
[34:28] go to YouTube trending millions billions
[34:32] of more people are paying attention to
[34:34] anything other than Bitcoin they're
[34:36] paying attention to anything other than
[34:39] finances and even though there are these
[34:41] Tik Tok videos that pop up of some
[34:43] person in their car yelling about how I
[34:45] can afford this and the politicians
[34:48] don't understand the working man it's
[34:50] still one video for
[34:56] 10,000 whatever [ __ ] is happening
[34:58] this time or oh look guys I got the new
[35:01] M Cafe swirl topper oh my there's so
[35:04] much more of that [ __ ] out there and
[35:08] unless things get really bad super bad
[35:12] like oh I don't have any money because a
[35:15] company it says in my bank account
[35:17] stolen from you by Bad Company it
[35:21] literally says that as a transaction oh
[35:23] now I have a reason to get upset until
[35:25] that happens to millions of people
[35:28] across this country or billion billions
[35:30] across the world it'll just be the frog
[35:33] in the pot slowly boiling and H yeah
[35:35] well some people complain about it and
[35:36] somebody will make a video and oh I
[35:38] agree with that guy and no back to my
[35:40] dayto day it's very similar
[35:43] to I don't know what happened to my
[35:45] Twitter feed but my Twitter feed has
[35:46] turned into an absolute [ __ ] dumpster
[35:50] fire and no matter how many times I tell
[35:52] it I'm not interested I'm not interested
[35:55] not interested this and it says okay
[35:56] we'll show you less of that doesn't show
[35:58] me less of that and I have for whatever
[36:01] reason gotten shoved into this corner
[36:04] where the most
[36:07] insane conspiracy theories or ideas are
[36:10] out there and like it's giving me all of
[36:11] the Flat Earth stuff it's giving me
[36:13] Holocaust didn't happen it's giving me
[36:16] Hitler was a good guy it's just the most
[36:19] crazy nonsense and I don't know how it
[36:22] happened because for a little while
[36:23] there it was great it was really good it
[36:25] was primarily Bitcoin people uh talking
[36:27] about stuff it was a the occasional
[36:31] model like an attractive woman hey I'm
[36:33] I'm a fan of that it was so it was Rel
[36:35] some neat outdoor photography from
[36:37] different photographers that's cool I
[36:39] like seeing neat places so was it was it
[36:40] was a nice good feed but it has turned
[36:42] into such
[36:44] garbage and that's God damn it it
[36:48] happened again but that's so much I lost
[36:50] my spot but that is so much of what
[36:52] people are inundated with that I don't
[36:54] think that people have the time or
[36:58] wherewithal or even care to go and look
[37:01] into Bitcoin and I do think that Bitcoin
[37:05] is simple enough for pretty much anybody
[37:07] to understand if you spend the time to
[37:10] my my advice is always go and just
[37:11] listen to uh Sav namos is the Bitcoin
[37:14] standard you can listen to it on YouTube
[37:16] it's on there it's 11 hours so if you
[37:17] play it in 2x speed one and a half speed
[37:21] you're going to be through it in in less
[37:22] than that time six to eight hours or so
[37:25] do that and if that doesn't happen have
[37:27] you at least
[37:28] going maybe I should get a hundred bucks
[37:32] 100 bucks worth of this thing then I
[37:34] don't know what will because most people
[37:38] myself included had no have no idea I
[37:40] had no idea how money works or what why
[37:42] it matters why it's important and once
[37:45] you do understand that it's basically
[37:48] it's not basically it's it's a system
[37:51] that a small group of people
[37:55] have a monopoly on counterfeiting and
[37:59] they can legally counterfeit it and you
[38:00] can't then you start to go oh that seems
[38:03] like a pretty bad system I wonder if
[38:06] there's something else out there oh
[38:07] there is there is there there's there is
[38:09] one other thing out there that is that
[38:11] can't be manipulated in that way thank
[38:14] you you already made it halfway through
[38:15] the video and I'm really really grateful
[38:18] to have you here two things make this
[38:20] channel possible you as a watcher and
[38:22] listener who keep supporting this
[38:24] Channel and another one is all the
[38:26] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[38:29] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[38:31] very start and where I personally buy my
[38:33] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[38:35] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[38:38] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[38:41] simplest and securest way to secure your
[38:44] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[38:46] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[38:49] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[38:51] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[38:55] 2% bracket and if you have self custody
[38:58] and you know your friend does not have
[38:59] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[39:01] he needs a birthday present and a small
[39:03] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[39:05] 5% off your order plus you support my
[39:09] channel and now let's get back to the
[39:11] video by the way for Twitter I also see
[39:13] that with my feed um I see more and more
[39:16] people making their own lists because
[39:18] you can add like a list to your uh
[39:21] instead of your for you or following tab
[39:23] you can make a list and I also have this
[39:26] like I have like I think three different
[39:28] Bitcoin lists with like 150 and 120
[39:32] people each on and I really enjoy that
[39:35] once I like do this and every time when
[39:37] I see someone new I add them to my list
[39:40] and it's it's a way cleaner thing and I
[39:41] also see it with other people because
[39:43] other people like add me today oh
[39:45] Bitcoin clean list or Bitcoin podcaster
[39:48] list or Bitcoin that that list so I see
[39:51] that getting more and more to a trend
[39:53] like when when IL musk took over uh more
[39:56] and more this list thing came came along
[39:59] I mean he makes even advertisement for
[40:02] that like go go on your for you page
[40:04] it's really good he always this but he's
[40:06] like you can also create your own list I
[40:09] I heard it two three times on a podcast
[40:11] with him okay I'll have to check that
[40:13] out it's really cool um but it's extra
[40:16] work uh and it's it's a pain in the back
[40:19] that uh Twitter just does not like the
[40:23] feed is weird and I also got that like I
[40:26] I see some some some uh some things I'm
[40:29] like why do I see that like what's like
[40:32] I see now pop things where like oh those
[40:35] are the eight best pop culture things
[40:37] that happened this year and I'm
[40:39] like I'm not interested in that yeah
[40:41] what have I ever done that makes you
[40:42] think I care about this I don't why is
[40:44] this
[40:45] happening yeah but uh what what you said
[40:49] is interesting because I also feel like
[40:51] that um and maybe I misinterpreted but
[40:54] do you also feel that the the pain is
[40:56] just not b enough because you also
[40:58] thought said about that frog and
[41:00] interesting about the Frog example I
[41:02] actually researched a little bit about
[41:03] that because I always F like there's
[41:06] actually a possibility that the frog is
[41:07] not jumping out of the water but at some
[41:09] point when you turn up the heat of the
[41:12] the water the the Frog actually jumps
[41:14] out of the water at least what what I
[41:16] saw of some research that I did um so I
[41:20] feel like we're just at the point where
[41:22] the water is not hot enough for the Frog
[41:24] to actually jump out and Discover it
[41:26] when I talk with
[41:27] people there I I I talked yesterday with
[41:30] another podcaster outside of Bitcoin
[41:32] because I was in a podcasting studio in
[41:35] in VI and he's like yeah I have faith in
[41:37] my in our financial system and my and I
[41:39] like it it's it's a good system because
[41:42] they're just in a in a cozy
[41:44] world I think that a lot of times when
[41:47] people hear the Frog and pot analogy
[41:50] they hear the pot and the water in it
[41:53] being bad system and the Frog being the
[41:58] people but that isn't how it works
[42:02] there's a lot of pots with a lot of
[42:04] frogs or the pot is really big and the
[42:08] heat source is in a few different places
[42:10] so that the water temperature is not I
[42:13] know the transfer of heat would move
[42:15] pretty quick through water but whatever
[42:17] there's there's there's partitions to
[42:18] the water where maybe it's really hot
[42:21] over here for one frog and he's ready to
[42:23] jump out but this frog over here has a
[42:25] really high heat tolerance so he doesn't
[42:26] even notice it's actually really cozy to
[42:28] him there's different kinds of frogs
[42:29] this one is a is a tropical frog and so
[42:32] he likes the warm and this is a this is
[42:34] not that this is a thing but this is an
[42:35] Arctic frog and so this is unbearable
[42:39] it's already too it's like Mr Freeze the
[42:41] degree above freezing is too much for
[42:43] him so it's a lot of frogs and a lot of
[42:45] different types of water so your point
[42:48] of jumping out of the water and going hm
[42:51] might need to look for a different
[42:52] solution was something but it wasn't the
[42:54] same as it was for me it wasn't the same
[42:56] as it was for sailor I don't have sailor
[42:58] concerns I don't have a multi-million
[43:00] dollar company that I need to do
[43:01] something with all this cash with and so
[43:04] I don't think that there is a point ever
[43:08] ever ever
[43:10] ever period I mean that ever where all
[43:14] of the frogs jump out of the water
[43:17] because you have to remember that the
[43:19] water is also being controlled by
[43:21] somebody there are politicians and they
[43:23] are part of the system too so if it got
[43:25] so bad because because of the policies
[43:27] that they're making they're sitting
[43:29] there signing into law and when I go
[43:31] outside anybody with a baseball bat can
[43:34] hit me in the head with it yes I sign
[43:36] that wait a second what did I just sign
[43:37] that seems like a really bad idea that
[43:39] they're part of the system too and so
[43:42] they have to live in this and yeah sure
[43:43] they're going to do things that are more
[43:45] favorable to them but people die and
[43:49] politicians go away and then new ones
[43:50] come in so it's a constant
[43:53] changing fractal have you ever watched a
[43:56] video where you see the mandal BR
[43:57] fractal videos on on on on YouTube and
[44:00] it just goes and just goes and goes and
[44:02] goes and goes and seems like this never
[44:03] ending thing try and guess where it's
[44:05] going to be in 10 seconds from wherever
[44:07] you are just just tell me exactly what
[44:11] that pattern is going to look like what
[44:13] is it what shape is going to be where
[44:14] what are the colors going to be if you
[44:16] can do that a thousand times in a row
[44:18] well okay maybe I'll start paying
[44:20] attention to when it comes to financial
[44:21] advice or what the world's going to do
[44:23] this is why I don't adhere to and I
[44:25] think that
[44:27] the whole fourth turning thing I think
[44:29] it's such [ __ ] I think all of that
[44:30] is such [ __ ] nonsense that some guys
[44:34] were like oh look let's cherry-pick a
[44:36] bunch of different things from different
[44:37] per points in time and call it the
[44:39] fourth turning and look you can go
[44:40] around I am willing to bet
[44:45] ,000 seriously
[44:48] $1,000 that if you wanted you could call
[44:51] something the six ways and you could go
[44:54] back from different points in time and
[44:56] look every six years this happens and if
[45:01] you find the right things and you
[45:02] pinpoint these various things it's going
[45:04] to look exactly like the six ways and we
[45:06] are now in the fifth way and as you can
[45:09] see because of this next presidential
[45:11] election there are two old men both
[45:14] running for office which happened 6times
[45:18] six years ago 666 mark of the
[45:22] beast obviously we're in the six ways
[45:25] and when we're in the sixth of the six
[45:27] ways then it all Loops back around to
[45:29] the first of the six ways [ __ ] you [ __ ]
[45:32] you none of that makes sense it's all
[45:34] [ __ ] it's some guy's like oh he woke
[45:37] up one night from a nap i' been making
[45:38] this up and he was like oh I bet I could
[45:41] sell a book yeah or maybe he watched
[45:44] something he's like that seems kind of
[45:45] familiar and I wonder if I go and pull
[45:47] on this thread if I can make something
[45:49] from this yeah and he did and then he
[45:51] sold a whole lot of books and then
[45:52] people are like look we can map the
[45:53] entirety of our existence onto this idea
[45:55] this model no you can't can't no you
[45:58] can't you can't do that with anything
[46:01] give me a break you can't figure out
[46:03] what's going to happen a week from now
[46:05] with you let alone the whole world you
[46:08] have no idea where you're going to be in
[46:09] a week from now you might have a general
[46:11] idea of yeah I'll probably be here and
[46:12] I'll probably be this but do you know
[46:14] what conversations you're going to have
[46:16] with your girlfriend or if your wife's
[46:17] going to call or your mom or your dead
[46:19] like no you don't that's what makes life
[46:22] so beautiful is that you have no [ __ ]
[46:25] idea so when people come up with their
[46:27] models about this and that and yeah I
[46:29] see that bitcoin's done the same sort of
[46:31] thing for a few different Cycles but is
[46:33] that going to happen again I don't know
[46:35] I don't care it doesn't matter I you
[46:39] know that's I I think that's kind of
[46:41] where I was going with the whole my
[46:42] Twitter feed being an absolute garbage
[46:44] Fest is I I I had I did a little mental
[46:48] experiment with my wife and I so I said
[46:51] let's just assume just for a second that
[46:55] all of them all of the conspir Es are
[46:57] real there was no moon landing the Twin
[47:00] Towers it was all an inside job all of
[47:02] it just the craziest ones President
[47:05] Biden is an actual literal lizard
[47:08] wearing some sort of uh uh men in black
[47:12] skin suit like all of them all all every
[47:14] single one and and
[47:16] what how does that change my life do I
[47:19] not go to work tomorrow to to get food
[47:23] to pay for rent no I still have to do
[47:24] that well okay so that doesn't change do
[47:27] I not love my wife anymore because I
[47:28] know that there's an Arctic ring of ice
[47:31] around the whole flat disc no no I I
[47:34] still love my
[47:36] wife uh if I put my hand in a fire does
[47:40] it not burn anymore do have I awakened
[47:42] to the true mysteries of life and i'
[47:44] I've broken the code no no fire still
[47:46] [ __ ]
[47:47] hurts so nothing changes for
[47:51] me yep nope nothing changes nothing
[47:54] changes so what are all these people
[47:56] doing they're they're they're bored
[47:57] they're lonely people and they need
[47:59] hobbies and hobbies are good and that's
[48:01] good that you have friends and you found
[48:02] some other weird friends and that's
[48:03] great do your weird
[48:06] stuff but it doesn't mean anything it
[48:09] doesn't mean a [ __ ] thing and so when
[48:11] people go around saying this is going to
[48:13] no no no the frogs aren't going to jump
[48:15] out of the water because there's too
[48:17] many frogs there's different frogs and
[48:19] there's new Frogs being born every
[48:21] single day and those frogs have
[48:22] different ideas it life is this constant
[48:25] expanding fractal and if you try and go
[48:28] it happens this way it works like this
[48:30] you're in for a world of pain buddy cuz
[48:32] that's not how it works that's not how
[48:34] anything works that's not how life works
[48:36] and if you haven't figured that out by
[48:37] now and you think that you've got it
[48:41] uh all right have fun with that I don't
[48:45] I don't know what benefit that is but if
[48:47] you've got it why are you running around
[48:49] trying to convince everybody else that
[48:50] you've got it shouldn't you be in a
[48:51] state of absolute abject peace and Bliss
[48:54] because you have found it doesn't seem
[48:55] like you found it if trying to convince
[48:57] other people because if you did find it
[48:59] then you wouldn't need to convince other
[49:00] people because you would just be off in
[49:02] this path of Enlightenment the Buddha
[49:04] the Jesus is but no no you're
[49:07] questioning which is why you're going
[49:08] around talking about it spamming stuff
[49:09] on YouTube spamming things on Twitter is
[49:12] because you need the validation or you
[49:13] want the money and oh look at that
[49:15] you're just trying to get engagement
[49:17] because you want more followers to make
[49:18] more money because you you have to what
[49:22] you have to pay bills you've got to put
[49:24] food on your table just like everybody
[49:26] else ever for all of time and that's
[49:29] just how it works and that's how it's
[49:30] going to keep on working in different
[49:32] forms in different ways and different
[49:34] factors and different new things and
[49:35] it's just going to change it'll be a
[49:36] little bit different but it won't be so
[49:38] different that you can't wrap your head
[49:39] around it it'll be different enough
[49:41] where you're like well this is new and
[49:42] it's kind of different but it it'll
[49:44] it'll just keep on changing and that's
[49:46] life and that's why or one of the
[49:49] reasons that I like Bitcoin because it
[49:51] doesn't change it is that ruler that we
[49:53] can go oh look there's 21 million of it
[49:56] now if Black Rock comes along and
[49:58] something drastically so if there is
[50:00] some crazy change to bitcoin on a big
[50:02] way where it does break where Black Rock
[50:06] comes in and convinces enough miners
[50:09] enough pools to do something that does
[50:11] fundamentally change Bitcoin then I'll
[50:13] go all right well I guess it was a fun
[50:14] experiment I always knew that there was
[50:16] a chance that things would go tits up I
[50:19] still know that I I don't know how it
[50:21] happens and I don't think it does I
[50:23] really don't but is there a non-zero
[50:25] chance that something really negative
[50:27] happens to bitcoin of course there is
[50:29] yeah it's not impervious to anything
[50:32] it's still a system that it it does need
[50:36] human intervention and there are AI
[50:38] coming around like I I don't know what
[50:39] the future holds I just spent 20 minutes
[50:41] saying that very [ __ ] thing so if I'm
[50:43] sitting here going no this is Bitcoin
[50:44] and it will always work and it's
[50:45] completely Flawless and there's zero
[50:47] chance and you will never ever lose your
[50:49] money it would only ever go up well if
[50:50] that was actually the case if that was a
[50:52] fundamental law of reality then
[50:55] everybody would be on a Bitcoin standard
[50:57] already but there are questions and
[50:59] there are unknowns and there are other
[51:01] factors at play here and here we are
[51:03] living the day today as best we can and
[51:06] does Bitcoin play into that it does in
[51:07] some way in a positive way does for me
[51:09] for everyone else remains to be seen
[51:12] that was uh again really really cool um
[51:16] when you said like uh we always have
[51:18] this thing that we don't change Bitcoin
[51:20] and it's a thing that I also really like
[51:22] that Bitcoin is predictable uh and and
[51:25] we have a not lot of things in in our
[51:27] life that are really predictable uh and
[51:30] even Bitcoin to some extent is not
[51:32] predictable because there are so much
[51:33] things that happening with it but the
[51:35] fundamental thing is predictable uh the
[51:39] price the symptoms the news on top of
[51:41] that all the the theat and the drama
[51:44] around the ecosystem that's not
[51:46] predictable um but we always have the
[51:49] saying like Bitcoin doesn't change but
[51:52] you change when you discover Bitcoin and
[51:55] you said you you got in Bitcoin when it
[51:56] was like 15,000 something like that so
[51:59] it's not that long ago it's still a time
[52:02] ago but not that long ago when we see it
[52:04] the the history of Bitcoin did did
[52:07] something change in your thinking when
[52:09] when you discovered Bitcoin or since you
[52:12] discovered Bitcoin yeah a lot of things
[52:15] I the main thing was that I didn't have
[52:17] a whole lot of Hope for the future for
[52:20] for myself like I I figured the world
[52:21] wouldn't change all that much but I I
[52:23] saw the writing on the wall and I could
[52:25] feel it more than I could articulate
[52:28] that that money was broken I and I I
[52:32] didn't know that I would just I would
[52:33] notice things like boy I remember back
[52:35] when I was a kid I could get those
[52:37] little cheap packets of ramen I don't
[52:39] know that I ever purchased them but I I
[52:40] I remember going shopping with my mom
[52:42] and you could get a pack of 10 of them
[52:45] for a dollar they were 10 cents a piece
[52:47] I I clearly remember that or not not all
[52:50] the time would they be but if they were
[52:52] on sale like if there was a special deal
[52:53] that they were having I I knew I would
[52:55] remember that like oh hey look can we
[52:57] get more Ramen because like I mentioned
[52:59] earlier we weren't exactly rich and so I
[53:01] was I would look for I was money
[53:03] conscious without understanding what
[53:04] money was because my mom would bring
[53:06] coupons and and she would look for deals
[53:08] and so I would as a child be like oh I
[53:10] want to help out here's a deal on a
[53:12] thing that I like this Ramen I really
[53:14] like the ramen so here it is it's a
[53:15] dollar for T like oh yeah grow okay good
[53:17] that's a good deal grab them or or tuna
[53:19] I like I really like tuna salad I still
[53:20] do I always have and so back then you
[53:23] could get a can of albor tuna for a
[53:25] dollar again 10 10 for 10 was a thing
[53:28] that's unheard of now you're looking at
[53:30] 250 if it's a really good deal maybe
[53:33] three bucks which is interesting because
[53:37] that means and I'll get to what what's
[53:39] changed for me here real quick but I'm
[53:41] talking about kind of the the gut
[53:42] feeling that I why is this happening
[53:44] prices dollars are buying less but
[53:49] um I I was at McDonald's I like
[53:52] McDonald's coffee it's really the only
[53:54] thing that I get there but I have if you
[53:55] use the app you can get where I'm at
[53:57] anyways a big coffee like this for a
[53:59] dollar that's an unbeatable deal for a
[54:02] coffee um and there was a person in
[54:04] front of me this just happened last
[54:06] night was a person in front of me in
[54:07] line and I'm sorry he was behind me I'd
[54:10] gone through I was waiting he was behind
[54:12] me I could hear him on on on the
[54:13] loudspeaker oh welcome to McDonald's how
[54:15] can I help you and he goes oh yeah gonna
[54:16] get two McChickens and a McDouble and I
[54:19] worked at McDonald's when I was 15 16
[54:22] and I thought oh that was three bucks
[54:24] back then and I so I think this quick
[54:26] that was three bucks back when I worked
[54:27] there because it was on the dollar menu
[54:29] and I hear the person say oh sure we've
[54:31] got uh repeats the order back to them
[54:33] and I I I think I don't how how much is
[54:35] that going to be it'll be $9.32 I like
[54:38] oh godamn it's gone up three times and
[54:41] that made me wonder has the dollar lost
[54:44] 60% of its value in the last 20ish odd
[54:48] years seems so given what I see with
[54:51] with Ramen and and uh with with tuna and
[54:54] like I just mentioned you could get it
[54:55] back in the day for a can and now it's
[54:57] 253 so it does seem like it's lost about
[54:59] 60% that's brutal but that I couldn't
[55:03] tell you why I just like something's
[55:05] happening here my Dollar's buying less
[55:07] stuff what the hell how is my dad able
[55:10] to on one
[55:11] income afford a home a whole home an
[55:15] actual home on a nearly an acre of land
[55:18] with five children and be the only
[55:21] person bringing in money how how with
[55:23] two cars and a motorcycle how do how
[55:25] what in the [ __ ] how how did that happen
[55:27] could I I can't do that there's nowhere
[55:29] at least in this country that I can do
[55:31] that and so once I found Bitcoin and
[55:34] started seeing Oh What It Is it it it
[55:37] gave me hope for the future in a way
[55:41] where my wife and I had never or not
[55:45] never but we had written off the
[55:46] possibility of children like it's hard
[55:49] enough for us to get by and and make the
[55:51] day-to-day and it's not hard it's not
[55:53] like we're on the streets it's just we
[55:55] don't have a whole lot of extra income
[55:57] so how in the world are we going to have
[55:59] a child and we don't we didn't we have
[56:01] never wanted to bring a child into the
[56:02] world if we couldn't at least provide
[56:04] something like I'm not trying to go on
[56:06] vacation every year and the best private
[56:09] school it's just just a a decent
[56:12] lifestyle that keeps the child off the
[56:15] streets out of a tin or a cardboard box
[56:17] can we do
[56:18] that I don't know it might be kind of
[56:20] dicey if we bring a child into the world
[56:22] but once Bitcoin came along and I
[56:25] realized what was and started saving in
[56:27] it and saw net worth go up I like maybe
[56:31] this actually could work and so we've
[56:33] talked about having a child and yeah so
[56:36] it it totally changed my outlook on that
[56:39] and just a little quick side note I I
[56:43] have a price for Bitcoin a very clear
[56:45] price there's some people say I never
[56:47] sell and as soon as you sell you you'll
[56:49] regret regret that you've that you've
[56:51] sold some all right well I I don't agree
[56:55] I have made some purchases with Bitcoin
[56:58] and I don't regret those at all I've
[57:00] gone to the the Bitcoin company that the
[57:02] where you can buy gift cards and stuff
[57:03] and I've made some purchases through
[57:04] that for various things and usually I
[57:06] just buy the Bitcoin back so I'm not
[57:08] really and I guess I'm kind of using
[57:09] Fiat but I'm getting a little bit of a
[57:10] kickback with the Bitcoin whatever but I
[57:12] don't I don't haven't regretted any of
[57:14] those and I'm talking small like a
[57:15] couple hundred dollars couple hundred a
[57:17] couple hundred there but my price for
[57:19] selling some Bitcoin is
[57:22] when I can get a home on at least an
[57:26] acre of land that's that's what I want I
[57:28] basically want the the childhood home
[57:31] that I grew up in something reminiscent
[57:33] of that not not the same place I don't
[57:35] want to live in Arizona again I don't
[57:36] think but that that that size and if I
[57:39] can trade half or less a Bitcoin for
[57:43] that I don't care if Bitcoin goes up a a
[57:48] thousand times from where it was because
[57:49] I can't live and play on
[57:53] bitcoin it's digital I can't do that and
[57:55] so I could raise a family I could play
[57:58] in the yard with a child or children at
[58:01] a home and so if I can trade half of
[58:03] Bitcoin or less for that that is my
[58:06] price now I don't want to trade the
[58:07] entirety of my stack for that but that
[58:10] that's my price in my mind of what I'm
[58:12] willing to separate and I think I
[58:14] imagine most people do have that price
[58:16] and if they don't I that's I don't that
[58:20] that's kind of odd to me as well I was
[58:21] like but what what are you doing this
[58:23] for then if you're just I just want to
[58:24] get as big a stack as I can well you've
[58:26] already lost that like there's other
[58:28] people that beat you no no I want my own
[58:29] personal stack to get bigger and bigger
[58:31] I want to see that my SATs number grow
[58:32] up oh okay that's an interesting game
[58:34] have all right do do you have a number
[58:37] you don't have to share what it is but
[58:38] is it do you have like a a thing that
[58:40] you want that you're doing this for is
[58:41] it just I just want to stack for
[58:43] stacking I have an interesting framework
[58:45] to think about uh for me is freedom uh
[58:49] the thing maybe I'm too young to think
[58:50] of family right now because I'm only 25
[58:54] and I do have a Comm did a relationship
[58:57] with with a girlfriend with with uh I
[59:00] was like even right now over one year
[59:03] but like having kids buying a big house
[59:07] staying at one location all this stuff
[59:09] it seems a little far off for me right
[59:11] now um but it comes closer and closer um
[59:15] but I have a framework where I'm like
[59:18] how long can I live off my Bitcoin stack
[59:23] like I calculate the thing like how how
[59:25] long long could I do absolutely nothing
[59:29] lay in the bed watch Netflix the rest of
[59:31] my life how how long is that period down
[59:33] where I've can just do nothing yeah and
[59:36] still survive still get to a restaurant
[59:39] still drive around with a car something
[59:41] like that um and I would never do
[59:44] nothing because I'm extremely like if
[59:46] I'm on a TW day holidays on the second
[59:49] day I get nervous I want to do something
[59:51] um but still I want to have this kind of
[59:54] Freedom um where I every once in a while
[59:58] look at my Bitcoin stack look at the
[60:00] cost of living look at how long could I
[60:03] do it now uh and when this year number
[60:08] um exceeds the years that I possibly can
[60:11] probably live then this is kind of my
[60:15] framework where I'm like okay this is a
[60:17] number where I'm really satisfied see
[60:19] it's really hard to predict in in dollar
[60:22] terms what it is yeah um because you
[60:24] don't know like how to dollar develop
[60:26] how does Bitcoin develop but that's how
[60:29] I try to think about it yeah I'm glad
[60:32] you mentioned that about how the dollar
[60:34] develops and what does that mean because
[60:35] that is something that I rarely hear
[60:38] people mention they're like oh I can't
[60:40] wait until Bitcoin is f can you imagine
[60:42] when bitcoin's $500,000 when it's a
[60:44] million dollar like oh that's cool what
[60:46] is the dollar worth at that point
[60:49] because unless people are accepting
[60:51] widely accepting Bitcoin which I don't
[60:53] think is going to happen for a long time
[60:56] I really don't think that the Starbucks
[60:58] sign and the apple and the Amazon now
[61:00] Bitcoin now preferred I don't think
[61:02] that's happening for a long long time
[61:04] maybe I'll be maybe I'm wrong I I have
[61:05] no idea I just I
[61:08] know I think it'll remain more like
[61:10] sailor talks about it digital property
[61:12] an asset that that you trade that you do
[61:13] things with that you sell when you want
[61:15] to that'll remain like the most liquid
[61:17] property real estate that exists but so
[61:20] many people don't talk about oh if
[61:23] Bitcoin is worth a million dollars yeah
[61:25] but you're burgers are $15 I've seen
[61:28] people like oh a Burger's $1,000 no
[61:30] Burger is not going to be $1,000 at that
[61:32] point but it might
[61:34] be18 I guess if you go to some
[61:35] restaurants now a burger already is $15
[61:37] so it might be $50 it might it might be
[61:40] $45 it might be a lot more
[61:44] but I just watched a video I think the
[61:47] the um the channel is got like 4,000 no
[61:49] I'm sorry not 4,000 a lot more than 4
[61:51] million subscribers I think it's called
[61:53] casually
[61:54] explained and he win through Bitcoin and
[61:57] he's talking about it and it's it's
[61:59] amusing it's supposed to be kind of
[62:00] funny tongue and- cheek stuff and he so
[62:03] he he's not disingenuous but he also is
[62:07] because the point is to be amusing and
[62:09] funny and he's trying to make jokes and
[62:10] he's trying to make you laugh i' I'd
[62:12] never seen the channel before but it
[62:14] popped up in my feet on YouTube like
[62:16] Bitcoin explained and so I watched it
[62:18] and he he mostly gets it right he gets a
[62:20] general idea of what Bitcoin is and how
[62:21] it's going to work but at one point he
[62:23] talks about the price and says that it's
[62:25] never going to go to $0 because there's
[62:28] a guy on Reddit that will buy all 21
[62:30] million coins for a penny a piece okay
[62:32] true and then he also says but it's not
[62:34] going to go to $10 million either
[62:35] because that would mean that the market
[62:37] cap was something like $400 trillion and
[62:40] I thought well that actually is more
[62:42] likely to happen the $10 million than
[62:45] the penny and it's more likely to happen
[62:47] because of money Printing and that's
[62:49] something that so few people outside of
[62:51] the Bitcoin space know about they don't
[62:54] understand why the prices go up I and I
[62:56] know that most people don't know this
[62:58] because the retail job that I have I
[63:00] work at a hardware
[63:01] store and since covid there has not been
[63:06] a day truly a day on average I guess I
[63:10] should say where I have worked and
[63:13] nobody has mentioned prices increasing
[63:17] every single day sometimes it's three
[63:18] times in a day sometimes it's 10 times
[63:19] in a day sometimes it's one time mean
[63:21] sometimes it's zero but on average it's
[63:22] at least a couple times a day that
[63:24] somebody goes man prices have gone up or
[63:26] they come up and they buy a a box of
[63:28] screws and they go man I remember when
[63:29] these were $5.99 they're they're $12.99
[63:32] what the hell happened it's all some
[63:34] comment like that and it's usually not
[63:36] like an attack on us they know that
[63:37] we're not raising prices arbitrarily
[63:40] they're just like man what what is going
[63:41] on I bought a burger the other day and
[63:43] it was 10 bucks I remember when I could
[63:45] get a a whole meal on lunch for five
[63:47] bucks what the heck's going on and often
[63:50] I will say well that's what happens when
[63:51] you print more money in the past couple
[63:53] of years than maybe ever before or I'll
[63:55] say something like that's what happens
[63:57] when a trillion dollars is being added
[63:59] to the balance sheet every 100 days and
[64:01] people just go like well
[64:02] huh nobody I say this to okay not nobody
[64:06] but very few people go yeah you're right
[64:09] almost every single one of them is like
[64:11] what are you what is that what are you
[64:13] what are you talking about I thought
[64:15] prices just went up every once in a
[64:18] while somebody be like you're exactly
[64:19] right and we'll have a little chat and
[64:20] like you know what we need to do and we
[64:22] got to get back they like have you ever
[64:23] checked out the website I've ran into
[64:24] this a couple times what happened in
[64:26] what the [ __ ] happened in 1971 I sure
[64:28] have I know that website real damn well
[64:31] but that number of people is one out
[64:34] of 30 it is not common it is not common
[64:39] that anybody has even an inkling of
[64:40] what's going on there just like prices
[64:42] go up I have less money sucks that's
[64:45] back to what I was saying about the Frog
[64:46] she like I it's getting worse I
[64:49] guess I'm back to work for me whatever
[64:54] um yeah
[64:57] that would been really interesting uh
[64:59] video going out in the street asking
[65:02] like 200 people why do prices rise yeah
[65:06] would be interesting answers I feel like
[65:08] and and probably two correct ones I got
[65:11] into it one time with this guy that came
[65:12] out he's like oh man just I said he said
[65:16] something about the prices and I made a
[65:18] comment about the trillion dollars or or
[65:20] more money printing something like this
[65:22] to kind of like I I guess I kind of do
[65:24] that to sort of test the water is like
[65:26] hey do you know why is this happening
[65:27] and I have an inkling I I I can't
[65:30] explain it in great detail but I do know
[65:32] that when you print more of a thing then
[65:34] that thing goes down in value and he's
[65:37] like yeah well it's actually greedy
[65:39] corporations and I was just like I it
[65:41] pissed me off I said no it's not it has
[65:43] absolutely nothing to do with greedy
[65:44] corporations they don't want to raise
[65:46] prices we don't want to raise prices
[65:49] there are some exceptions to that like
[65:51] that stupid brand Supreme yes they put a
[65:53] really high price on their on their
[65:54] silly t-shirt and their the bricks that
[65:56] they sell or whatever but most places
[65:59] want to sell their product and if you
[66:02] want to sell your product you don't
[66:04] raise the price a whole [ __ ] ton you
[66:07] find how what is the margin that we need
[66:10] to make here and depending on the
[66:12] product to get it into people's hands
[66:14] because you have some other idea you're
[66:16] going to lose money often times when
[66:18] video game consoles are first to
[66:19] releases they lose money on those but
[66:22] they make money in the long run because
[66:23] of the digital sales and the this and
[66:25] then that and all this other stuff but
[66:27] greedy corporations are not it just
[66:29] pissed me off when the guy said that and
[66:30] because I shot back at him and because I
[66:33] work in a mom and pop hardware store I
[66:34] can say pretty much whatever the [ __ ] I
[66:35] want to anyone I want anytime I want and
[66:37] I the boss the owners will just chuckle
[66:40] I've gotten heated with customers and
[66:42] they're just like oh I took a guy down I
[66:44] have a video of it a shoplifter came in
[66:46] I I know some Jiu-Jitsu I jumped on his
[66:49] bag and had him in a a rear naked choke
[66:51] you can't do that at most places you can
[66:54] do that I work they were happy that I
[66:57] did that
[66:59] anyhow um yeah it pissed me off that
[67:02] that I got into it with this or that
[67:03] this guy just blindly thought that it
[67:05] was greedy corporations like
[67:07] man come on and the thing that pissed me
[67:10] off about that the most what this guy
[67:13] was in his like 60s or at least his 50s
[67:15] a rough 50s maybe a pretty decent 70s so
[67:18] an older guy old enough to know better
[67:20] if this had come out of the mouth of
[67:21] like a 15-year-old a high school kid
[67:23] who's probably not even going to notice
[67:24] anyways but if it had or a college
[67:26] student I'd be like all right you're
[67:28] just you don't know better that's that's
[67:30] okay but that was out of somebody that
[67:32] should definitely know better oh those
[67:34] greedy corporations come on man what are
[67:36] you doing no it's not greedy
[67:40] corporations
[67:42] geez yes there are greedy corporations
[67:45] sure they exist yes people want to make
[67:47] money but I I I might have this wrong
[67:52] but when I learned it if this is
[67:53] accurate actually I'm just going to see
[67:55] if uh
[67:57] McDonald's cuz I heard that the
[67:59] McDonald's CEO somebody posted this on
[68:01] Twitter they said the MC did you know
[68:02] that the McDonald's CEO makes $10
[68:05] million what in the world does he need
[68:07] with all that money I thought $10
[68:09] million for the CEO of McDonald's that
[68:13] is [ __ ] nothing that's insane that's
[68:15] so little money for being the CEO of
[68:20] McDonald's I don't know if that's
[68:22] accurate but I'm looking it up right now
[68:23] McDonald's CEO salary
[68:26] uh Chris received a a huge raise last
[68:29] year from let's see
[68:32] pandemic letes it say here then with
[68:35] McDonald's I think there's also probably
[68:37] some some stock compensations and and
[68:39] plans like that involved so it's
[68:41] probably like uh hard number to to get
[68:44] but like uh all in all it should be more
[68:48] yeah like right right here this is from
[68:49] 2021 says McDonald CEO Chris kki
[68:52] received more than 10.8 million in
[68:54] compensation last year that's so little
[68:56] money that's so little for being the CEO
[68:59] of McDonald's one of the most well-known
[69:01] brands in the world like I I don't know
[69:04] how much it should be but that's not a
[69:06] greedy Corporation and the McDonald's
[69:09] that I go to everybody's happy I don't
[69:11] know the customer service is off the
[69:13] charts or they smile thank you have I I
[69:17] know McDonald's gets a bad rap and has
[69:19] ever since that Morgan
[69:20] Spurlock came out with that documentary
[69:22] super siiz me and admittedly it's not
[69:24] great food I'm not going to out here and
[69:25] say that it is but if you want a clean
[69:28] bathroom and you want a coffee that
[69:30] tastes the same everywhere you go like
[69:31] McDonald's is doing a lot of things
[69:33] right I mean that there's a reason that
[69:34] they are the biggest name when it comes
[69:35] to fast food I in and out I'm not
[69:39] sitting here saying that you should eat
[69:40] fast food I'm just saying that if you
[69:42] want to eat fast food and you like a
[69:45] good brand McDonald's is hard to beat I
[69:48] can understand why uh Warren Buffett has
[69:51] got stock in
[69:52] McDonald's a pretty cool company makes
[69:55] me smile when I pass by one I I don't
[69:57] know maybe maybe it's just I'm a little
[69:59] kid but I don't hate McDonald's I I
[70:01] can't it's an American I like them I
[70:04] like them small fun fact uh I started my
[70:08] investing Journey after I got out of
[70:10] ETFs and stuff like that with with
[70:13] individual stocks and McDonald's was the
[70:15] first stock I ever bought uh and I loved
[70:19] it and I made like 100 bucks or
[70:21] something like that with it and I loved
[70:24] it a lot so I I always have a sympathy
[70:27] for McDonald's and I usually like I've
[70:29] been not there probably for like two
[70:31] months but usually like on average I'm
[70:34] probably like there to eat 10 10 times a
[70:36] year or something like that uh and
[70:39] especially when you're on the road and
[70:41] you're are busy then then it's really
[70:43] nice you just go in there you know it's
[70:45] quick you know it's good you're not
[70:47] getting disappointed you know you get
[70:49] something in your stomach uh and the
[70:52] brand is really good but the thing with
[70:53] the prizes it's also really interesting
[70:56] um I always ask when someone it's a
[70:59] greedy Corporation I'm like okay are
[71:01] those creedy corporations have
[71:03] monopolies because without the
[71:04] monopolies you cannot raise prices
[71:06] without getting hit like if there are
[71:08] two companies doing the same thing and
[71:10] one is just raising the prices uh and
[71:13] they are the same quality or similar
[71:15] quality then they will of course flu to
[71:17] the other like consumer are not stupid
[71:20] and just buy the the the higher price
[71:23] tag for nothing especially with all the
[71:26] internet and and and videos going on and
[71:29] and [ __ ] on each other um when
[71:31] there's no Monopoly uh they're not
[71:34] raising prices because they want to they
[71:36] they raising prices because they have to
[71:38] yeah yeah exactly and I imagine if you
[71:42] look at it through the lens of a
[71:43] socialist or a communist you like well
[71:46] look if the if the CEO made only
[71:50] $500,000 then you could put more money
[71:52] to this and this and every McDonald's
[71:53] employee could get a raise of half in oh
[71:56] boy yeah I guess I guess so is that
[72:00] going to do anything for any I I don't
[72:03] know how many stores McDonald's stores
[72:05] there are I'm sure with a little bit of
[72:06] math we could figure it out but I'm
[72:07] guessing that if the CEO of McDonald's
[72:10] went down to a salary of let's just go
[72:13] all the way down to
[72:14] $100,000 I don't think that all of the
[72:18] employees across the McDonald's entire
[72:20] brand is are getting more than like a
[72:23] two cent raise Maybe maybe it's not it's
[72:27] it's definitely not $5 it's it's it's
[72:29] not enough money for all of the probably
[72:32] millions of workers at McDonald's to all
[72:35] get a sun $10 raise and go oh here we go
[72:40] I've I've ascended to the the upper
[72:42] middle class oh now I can buy the home
[72:46] now I can buy the 20 acre ranch now I'm
[72:50] set here we go thank you Mr CEO you rich
[72:54] greedy money finally you got an
[72:56] altruistic bone in your body and now
[72:58] we're all living on High Street thank
[73:00] you McDonald's
[73:02] no no I just p i just pull it up uh
[73:06] McDonald's apparently has two million
[73:09] employees okay two million yeah so 2
[73:12] million employees if the guy went down
[73:14] to so let's say he made Z that's $10
[73:17] million for 2 million if it's not yeah
[73:20] they're not
[73:22] getting that's 5 for $5 for for each uh
[73:26] employee right right five five five EUR
[73:28] five bucks like it's not that it would
[73:31] be nice but then everybody would
[73:33] acclimate to that new exp that that
[73:36] money let's say that they're all at
[73:38] let's say they're at $10 an an hour on
[73:40] average or let's say it's they're at
[73:41] five bucks an hour on average there are
[73:43] many places in the US where they're
[73:44] making like 15 even $20 an hour
[73:46] depending on the shift and and and
[73:48] whatever like there's the one McDonald's
[73:50] I often see now hiring starting at1 1850
[73:53] an hour I think maybe it's up to 1950 an
[73:55] hour but I I'm in the Pacific Northwest
[73:57] and we have various labor laws but let
[73:59] let's say it's $5 an hours let's say it
[74:01] doubles the McDonald's employees it
[74:04] still isn't going to make them go from
[74:06] living in an apartment to buying a home
[74:08] doubling that in it's not enough to have
[74:10] that much of an impact if the CEO went
[74:13] from 10 million to Z
[74:16] overnight it would be nice for a little
[74:18] while but it would feel like a fancy big
[74:19] bonus and
[74:21] then you might upgrade your apartment
[74:23] you might
[74:25] make do do a few changes or something
[74:27] but it it's not yeah and it it it's per
[74:30] year you like if he makes uh when you
[74:33] spread that five five dollar per per
[74:38] employee that's not not per hour it's
[74:40] like per year you get five uh $5 more
[74:43] like that's that's it just doesn't make
[74:45] sense right yeah I wasn't even I was
[74:46] thinking it was yeah an
[74:48] hourly yeah you're right it would it
[74:50] would be it wouldn't be doubling there
[74:51] it would be it really would be like
[74:52] pennies if it would be like plus 000000
[74:57] 1% or something like that I don't
[74:59] know oh the big greedy CEO is ruining
[75:03] everyone's
[75:04] lives you do some real simple like
[75:07] five-year-old math and you realize how
[75:09] stupid that
[75:10] is yeah definitely and it's so easy like
[75:13] I I did not know how many employ like
[75:15] it's it's a really quick Google search
[75:16] and it just shows up yeah um like only
[75:21] like when you search like you have to
[75:23] search with the stores because the
[75:25] stores it's just 200,000 employees uh
[75:27] but with the stores it's like a lot more
[75:30] and but we already are really with the
[75:32] progress with the time and and I think
[75:35] we set our appointment till 10 and it's
[75:37] now 10 at my time uh so let's uh let's
[75:39] wrap it up let's come to our end routine
[75:42] um before we come to the end routine I
[75:44] have usually one question that I ask my
[75:46] guest but I get in the past uh few I
[75:51] almost got almost the same answer uh and
[75:54] the answer was always family so I want
[75:56] to change up that uh last question so we
[75:59] get different answers what was the
[76:01] question I I'm just
[76:02] curious um what are you currently
[76:05] passionate about besides Bitcoin oh and
[76:08] my intention with the question was so we
[76:10] can learn from each other from
[76:12] bitcoiners um outside of Bitcoin okay
[76:16] that was my
[76:17] intention family that's that's not what
[76:19] I would use the word I'm not passionate
[76:21] about family I love my family but I'm
[76:24] that's a weird answer for okay most like
[76:27] uh I think every second answer was oh
[76:30] family and this is where most my time is
[76:33] spent uh uh it's like there like add its
[76:37] family sports or some
[76:39] instrument okay the instrument would be
[76:41] the closest thing that I would I would
[76:42] say my answer would have been writing
[76:44] that's the the the the number one
[76:45] storytelling is the number one thing
[76:47] that I I care about after family yes I
[76:50] care about my family and I love my
[76:51] family but that that writing is my
[76:54] passion but what's your new
[76:55] question my new question is what when
[76:58] what can we learn from you besides
[77:00] Bitcoin no I guess writing yeah I I've
[77:03] written some stuff and I'm working on a
[77:05] book right now it has nothing to do with
[77:06] Bitcoin there is some a few things in
[77:09] there that deal with money I I guess
[77:11] tangent it's not really not about that
[77:13] it's it's
[77:15] a I don't even know where the idea for
[77:17] the story came from but it's a
[77:20] um a light fantasy novel meaning that
[77:23] the the fan there's no magic in it there
[77:25] might be at some point I don't know
[77:26] there's no magic in it I'm 80,000 words
[77:28] into it so to put that into perspective
[77:30] it's a little bit longer than Harry
[77:31] Potter Harry Potter was 72,000 73,000
[77:34] words long so currently it's a little
[77:36] bit longer than that I think it'll end
[77:37] at about 110 120 words long uh and I'd
[77:42] like to try and get it published I think
[77:46] there's the there's
[77:47] a blanking on it but I've talked to the
[77:49] guy through the orange pill app he does
[77:52] publish publishing and I think he's only
[77:54] thus far published Bitcoin books but I
[77:57] asked him if he'd be interested in
[77:59] publishing other books a book by a
[78:02] bitcoiner that has nothing to do with
[78:03] Bitcoin and at the time he said yes he
[78:05] would be so I'm I Look to pursue that
[78:08] and then after I'm done with this I'm
[78:10] going to be writing something that I
[78:11] think would appeal to bitcoiners the
[78:14] book that I'm currently reading I
[78:16] ideally would appeal to people of of
[78:19] many walks of life because it doesn't
[78:22] really have anything to do with Bitcoin
[78:24] the monetary system is there's gold and
[78:26] silver and it it's like a fantasy story
[78:29] but the next thing I'm going to write is
[78:31] going to
[78:33] be I I just I'll tell you where I'm
[78:35] taking inspiration from I'm taking
[78:37] inspiration from Ein Rand Atlas Shrugged
[78:40] so if you like long multiple page
[78:43] monologues it's going to have that
[78:46] characters basically voicing my opinions
[78:49] through a character it's going to have a
[78:50] lot of that so if you're like I just
[78:51] want a story to be a story I don't want
[78:52] to hear the [ __ ] author's thoughts
[78:53] well this book won't be for you it's
[78:55] going to be a lot of that it's going to
[78:57] break the fourth wall so I will talk
[78:59] directly to the reader so it'll be sort
[79:00] of like an essay it's going to have a
[79:02] clear story in it to the story
[79:04] inspiration is going to come from things
[79:05] like Metal Gear Solid that not great
[79:08] civil war movie I have my own take on
[79:10] what a silver war might look like and uh
[79:14] Stephen King's The
[79:16] Stand um it's going to be an
[79:19] amalgamation of so many of the different
[79:21] things that I like it's going to do
[79:23] weird [ __ ] it it'll break the fourth
[79:25] wall it'll have things that don't follow
[79:28] the laws of physics but it will have a
[79:29] clear story in it and it will deal with
[79:33] Bitcoin and that that'll be I was going
[79:36] to have inspiration from like RI Mist
[79:38] the video game Riven it's going to be a
[79:41] funky one nice looking forward to that
[79:43] really cool then we come to our last
[79:45] question to the actually end routine
[79:47] where the previous guest is asking a
[79:49] question for the next guest without
[79:50] knowing who the next guest actually is
[79:52] uh and the question that you got from
[79:54] the previous guest was what is your
[79:57] favorite aspect of Bitcoin culture well
[80:01] okay I like it when people are super
[80:04] toxic and I like it even more when they
[80:07] have a face to their toxicity anybody
[80:09] can hide behind uh pseudonym or be
[80:13] anonymous and be toxic but honestly one
[80:17] of the biggest reasons I got into
[80:19] Bitcoin was because of safine Amos on
[80:21] Lex fredman and being just no shit's
[80:25] given safine calling [ __ ] coiners [ __ ]
[80:28] coiners being aggressive being abrasive
[80:31] I like that a lot and I wish there was
[80:35] more of people being called out I know
[80:37] there were some people calling out breed
[80:38] love with all of that nonsense that
[80:41] happened but I I like that and so I um
[80:46] yeah that that is something that I like
[80:48] a lot in in
[80:50] Bitcoin I think I never had a guest on
[80:54] that said I like the to toxicity in
[80:56] Bitcoin I wish there was more of it and
[80:59] I like that I had finally someone on
[81:02] because uh the toxicity in Bitcoin was
[81:06] the thing that prevented me to go into
[81:08] shitcoin and to go into this Celsius uh
[81:12] weird things so like the the toxicity of
[81:15] Bitcoin especially on bitcoin Twitter um
[81:18] saved me a lot of money and you you can
[81:21] say what you want but uh it definitely
[81:23] saved me money yeah there's an overlap
[81:25] there with like the the 2A the the
[81:27] Second Amendment gun gun Community there
[81:28] are good guns and there are trash guns
[81:30] that will hurt you because they have
[81:32] they're prone to breaking and the gun
[81:34] Community is not shy about that like
[81:36] [ __ ] this company they're doing stupid
[81:38] stuff do not support them this is a good
[81:40] company over here I like that kind of
[81:42] attitude just just raw truth and okay so
[81:46] now I'm supposed to come up with a
[81:47] question for the next guest yeah I
[81:49] usually do it offline like you can take
[81:51] like even if you want like can take a
[81:54] few hours to think about I have one but
[81:57] if you have one you can uh give it us
[81:59] right now yeah what is some okay this is
[82:01] this is my question for them is what is
[82:04] a personal health failing that you wish
[82:08] you did more of wish you walked more got
[82:11] out in the sun more brushed your teeth
[82:14] regularly what whatever what is
[82:15] something that you fail to do and you
[82:18] recognize that in
[82:19] yourself what what's preventing you from
[82:21] doing that and what is one suggestion
[82:24] that you would make to somebody else to
[82:27] to overcome that so if it is you want to
[82:31] lift more weights and you think that
[82:32] that would be a good thing or you'd like
[82:33] to drink more water and you're aware of
[82:35] this failing in yourself what is your
[82:38] advice to yourself and then other people
[82:39] that might also have that failing but
[82:42] nothing to do with Bitcoin it's just a
[82:44] personal maintenance question it's
[82:47] amazing uh I just like wrote it down so
[82:49] I I remember without without rewatching
[82:52] the video um uh
[82:55] and I don't limit the the questions like
[82:59] I intentionally don't give any like oh
[83:02] it should be a Bitcoin question or it
[83:03] should not be a Bitcoin question like I
[83:05] don't I don't want to put anything um
[83:07] because there are so many interesting
[83:10] questions and I maybe even think about
[83:14] like releasing like an article with the
[83:17] most interesting questions and and the
[83:19] answers to it or something like that
[83:20] because the questions are really cool uh
[83:23] and sometimes the the answers are even
[83:25] better to that and I mean there are also
[83:29] like really boring questions or
[83:32] questions that almost make no sense
[83:35] um but but there's there's everything in
[83:38] there and sometimes a question that did
[83:41] not make sense for me or was boring for
[83:43] me brought up a really interesting uh
[83:45] answer like that it's there's all to it
[83:48] and sometimes an interesting question
[83:49] brings up a boring answer like that
[83:51] there's everything in there um but the
[83:54] interesting stuff is because I do it
[83:55] daily I do it so much and you're my
[83:57] 172 guest and I just do it half a year
[84:00] now um there's a lot of content that I
[84:05] can see through and when I pick like the
[84:07] the 20 highlights they will be really
[84:09] great yeah you could go through and do
[84:11] like a quarterly thing where you just go
[84:13] use OBS or however it is that you record
[84:15] you could just go through each of your
[84:16] videos clip that section and so each it
[84:19] just you could just make a [ __ ] ton of
[84:20] shorts where it just you could clip it
[84:22] up where it's less than a minute it goes
[84:24] the question was question and then the
[84:26] person goes oh okay and then they answer
[84:28] it and just bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
[84:29] that that that' be some easy content
[84:31] right there I have a lot of content and
[84:34] I have to repurpose them better that's
[84:37] for
[84:38] sure but yeah uh before before I let you
[84:41] go uh where can people find you where
[84:42] can people ask you questions and and and
[84:44] read listen and watch your stuff uh
[84:47] let's see there's three main places if
[84:49] you go to Twitter my handle is
[84:51] thankfully I have a a an uncommon name
[84:53] and so my Twitter handle is my name it
[84:55] is deopa d l i o p r a no funky Char
[85:01] just my name that's it if you want to
[85:04] that's a good place to find me there
[85:05] there's a link to my YouTube channel
[85:06] which has less than a 100 subscribers
[85:08] and that I don't expect that to change
[85:10] all that much unless you like that
[85:13] toxicity that I talked about that you're
[85:15] going to get a [ __ ] ton of that on my
[85:17] channel I do not hold my my goal with
[85:20] that is to be the most raw unfiltered
[85:23] version no [ __ ] given come and ban me
[85:25] YouTube I don't give a [ __ ] that is my
[85:27] goal with that so if you want somebody
[85:29] that is not being PC you want somebody
[85:31] that is just saying whatever he wants to
[85:33] say on YouTube about it all pertains to
[85:36] bitcoin there you go I try to release
