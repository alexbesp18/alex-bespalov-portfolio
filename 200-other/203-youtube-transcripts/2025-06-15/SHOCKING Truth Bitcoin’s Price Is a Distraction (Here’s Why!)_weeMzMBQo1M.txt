[00:00] maybe bitcoin price just goes up because
[00:02] people like speculating and it doesn't
[00:03] matter if it's IOU Bitcoin or it's real
[00:06] Bitcoin of course it matters to People
[00:08] Like Us who take self- custody it's a
[00:10] great opportunity in fact I'm confident
[00:12] enough in Bitcoin that I don't need to
[00:13] talk about it people are overestimating
[00:16] the short-term power of what Bitcoin can
[00:18] do and underestimating the long-term
[00:21] power of what it can do I think what you
[00:22] should be saying is are you free you
[00:25] know is your salary buying the same as
[00:28] it used to more more or less you know
[00:31] these are the questions that make people
[00:33] think people are great at picking up
[00:35] when somebody is doing better than you
[00:37] talk about these topics that inevitably
[00:40] lead to bitcoin as the solution instead
[00:43] of offering the solution right away to a
[00:44] problem that people don't realize they
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] have I think last time we talked also on
[00:52] like uh the concept of like Bitcoin
[00:55] borrowing but also how to be as free as
[00:58] possible that's why I remembered also so
[01:00] like uh where you live because I think
[01:02] we also talked about how to pos position
[01:05] yourself in in this world and and where
[01:07] to live uh and you're now uh interesting
[01:10] enough uh writing something that you
[01:13] just sent me before and it was
[01:14] interesting like prepare survive and
[01:16] thrive in Bitcoin uh somewhere along
[01:19] those lines um what are you doing there
[01:22] like is is that a a book that you're
[01:25] kind of writing on or just like an
[01:26] article or just some thoughts yeah it's
[01:29] kind of of all of those things it
[01:31] started well maybe a little bit of
[01:33] background to your to your viewers and
[01:35] listeners um maybe some people know I've
[01:37] been publishing and translating Bitcoin
[01:40] books for the past six years mostly
[01:42] other people's work and I do write on
[01:45] occasion myself when I have the time and
[01:47] I wrote this article for C 21 which is
[01:50] the magazine or Zen um published by H
[01:54] not I wrote this article called wielding
[01:57] Bitcoin prepare uh well it didn't have
[02:00] the subtitle then but now I'm I'm
[02:02] writing it into a book with the subtitle
[02:04] of uh prepare survive and thrive it's a
[02:08] project that I started after that
[02:09] article like maybe three years ago maybe
[02:12] more it's something that I'm sort of
[02:14] writing like like you put it I'm sort of
[02:16] writing it on the side not really like
[02:18] I'm I'm just putting a lot of
[02:20] thoughts um on a on a piece of paper a
[02:23] digital paper and then I hope that it's
[02:25] going to turn into a book that I can
[02:27] publish um that is mine that is somebody
[02:30] else's book so that's kind of like the
[02:32] what I'm doing right now is that would
[02:35] that be your first book or did you write
[02:37] books before it will be my first
[02:39] published book at least i' I've written
[02:42] tons of things for myself just to you
[02:44] know as a process of you know as as a
[02:47] thinker helps me to organize my thoughts
[02:50] to write things but I have never
[02:52] published apart from one one short story
[02:55] in 21 Futures Tales from the time chain
[02:57] that's that's the only one that a piece
[03:00] that made made it into print from me
[03:03] interesting and and I want to talk about
[03:05] that uh but maybe before uh because
[03:08] there has been a lot happening since the
[03:10] last episode uh what are kind of your
[03:14] highlights in the in the in the last
[03:16] year uh and and how did you see that all
[03:19] coming to like one year ago I think the
[03:22] most exciting thing was the ETF and the
[03:24] launch there and and now we have a
[03:26] strategic Bitcoin reserve and the whole
[03:28] development there it's kind of crazy how
[03:30] far we've gotten in that one year yeah
[03:33] that's interesting that you you should
[03:34] ask that and and put it that way um last
[03:38] time we spoke I believe the topic was
[03:40] Bitcoin is boring right um I started
[03:43] making these quite controversial tweets
[03:46] and uh and opin Publishing my opinions
[03:49] about Bitcoin how it is boring and how
[03:51] we're sort of facing this mundan
[03:53] ification and normification of Bitcoin
[03:56] which I find extremely bullish for
[03:58] Bitcoin of course because this is uh how
[04:01] all technological innovations make their
[04:03] way into the wider market after
[04:06] resistance it becomes kind of like
[04:08] Common Place boring even and people just
[04:10] start using it and I think this is this
[04:12] is sort of what's happening and the
[04:14] whole you know like nation state
[04:16] adoption or companies starting to use
[04:19] Bitcoin wider adoption like I I live in
[04:22] Madera where now over 100 places accept
[04:25] Bitcoin as a payment method that was uh
[04:29] not not nearly as much a year ago let
[04:32] alone 2 years ago so a lot of things for
[04:34] sure have happened in a in a short
[04:36] period of time
[04:38] personally I've focused on building and
[04:42] working on other projects that generate
[04:44] cash flow and generate contacts this is
[04:48] something that I'm talking in the book
[04:50] like this is the preparation part which
[04:52] will then allow you to
[04:55] survive there's I I guess it's not a
[04:58] controversial opinion to say that we're
[05:00] sort of looking at some kind of a
[05:01] financial Fallout uh some kind of a
[05:04] crash in in a global scale so surviving
[05:07] that and then what comes after you know
[05:09] it's not all doom and glue I mean there
[05:11] there's always Empires rise and fall and
[05:15] this time will be no different we will
[05:17] raise up again just like Bitcoin it
[05:20] crashes and then it ra raises up again
[05:22] from a higher level and goes even higher
[05:25] so this is a inbuilt property u in in
[05:29] human in my opinion so um I think a lot
[05:33] about time preference now that it's very
[05:36] popular thing to say like have a low
[05:38] time preference and you know don't be in
[05:42] a
[05:43] hurry uh people sort of say this but I I
[05:48] don't see a lot of action backing it
[05:50] which is exactly why I'm writing this
[05:51] book it it's going to be more like a
[05:54] grounded unpopular opinion about Bitcoin
[05:58] it's it's a very bullish take in my
[06:00] opinion but it's a much more grounded
[06:02] take than um a lot of so-called
[06:05] influencers or or people who would like
[06:07] to ride the wave of know Bitcoin ngu
[06:10] technology kind of stuff I'm not really
[06:13] into that anymore like I I focus on more
[06:16] fundamental stuff like for me Bitcoin
[06:19] has already become boring so it is safe
[06:21] for me to step away from it and stop
[06:24] stop my uh evangelism in a way which is
[06:28] something that I've been doing for years
[06:30] um almost a
[06:32] decade and uh yeah I think it's time
[06:36] Bitcoin has reached a point of some
[06:38] people talk about escape velocity I I
[06:40] think we're very close to that like it
[06:42] is you cannot undo uh what Bitcoin has
[06:46] done so now it's more about how can you
[06:50] improve yourself your surroundings and
[06:54] and find a way to survive possible
[06:57] calamities Financial calamities and then
[07:00] Thrive and build back better interesting
[07:03] what what does uh I think escape
[07:05] velocity is something that gets as you
[07:07] said like thrown a lot thrown around a
[07:10] lot what does that mean uh for you like
[07:13] once you reach that well what it means
[07:15] to me is that I'm confident enough in
[07:18] Bitcoin that I don't need to talk about
[07:19] it in fact I prefer not to talk about it
[07:22] at least when I'm with the so-called
[07:24] normies I used to bring it up in every
[07:27] single conversation to the point of
[07:30] annoyment I'm sure many many can
[07:32] relate I was that guy I'm not that guy
[07:35] anymore and I don't want to like
[07:38] I I think I did my part and I'm doing my
[07:41] part in building a Bitcoin Library so
[07:43] when people are ready to take that step
[07:45] and learn about this technology and some
[07:47] people will never be and I fully accept
[07:49] that that information is now readily
[07:52] available so that's part of sort of the
[07:55] escape Velocity like it's there the seed
[07:57] is planted and now it's up to humans to
[08:00] take action and usually humans always
[08:03] are seeking profit one way or
[08:05] another um and Bitcoin has a funny way
[08:09] of tweaking those actions through preser
[08:13] um
[08:15] perceived value add on that action so it
[08:19] changes the equation slightly I wouldn't
[08:21] go as far as to say that Bitcoin fixes
[08:24] the world or Bitcoin fixes everything it
[08:26] just simply provides a better more
[08:29] Justified monetary framework for
[08:33] exchanging value between individuals so
[08:36] this should definitely uh help at least
[08:40] in my opinion to to bring about a more
[08:43] sustainable world where Human Action is
[08:46] not skewed by so-called Fiat incentives
[08:50] but rather those kind of things like
[08:53] there will still be people who will you
[08:55] know cheat and lie and hurt other people
[08:59] but it will will become more difficult
[09:01] and more expensive and I think that's
[09:02] the best that best that we can we can
[09:04] ever hope so I don't have this uh brosy
[09:08] um view of a utopian world it would be
[09:13] not that different than what we've
[09:15] already seen in history but it will oh
[09:18] like I said Empires rise and fall and
[09:21] then we start up again and then we raise
[09:23] up higher so this this will continue to
[09:26] be a
[09:27] trend yeah is incentive is a big thing I
[09:30] feel like uh and and that's what a lot
[09:32] of people think like oh like Bitcoin
[09:34] fixes the health system Bitcoin fixes
[09:36] that like yes and no like it it just
[09:39] gives the right incentives uh people
[09:42] will still be I think humans will still
[09:44] be humans and humans have errors even in
[09:46] a sound money systems but at least we
[09:49] have the right incentive framework and
[09:53] uh incentives is everything in in life
[09:56] yes exactly like good example would be
[09:59] like regulation in food industry let's
[10:02] let's say that there's a worry that if
[10:05] we don't interfere at a government level
[10:08] to the restaurant operation the
[10:11] restaurant owner will poison there use
[10:14] poor quality ingredients and poison
[10:16] their customers which is a ridiculous
[10:17] claim because then they won't have
[10:19] customers so uh unless they are of
[10:23] course getting subsidized by the by the
[10:25] government or some other body uh to to
[10:28] give this poison into people and getting
[10:30] paid that way and this is where the
[10:32] skewed Fiat incentives comes from come
[10:34] from but like you said it's Human Action
[10:37] in the end that dictates the outcomes
[10:39] and it just
[10:41] becomes I guess more expensive to be an
[10:44]  that H and uh the it's like also
[10:49] interesting of like how much the the
[10:51] state should interfere in in free
[10:53] markets and uh and and I'm very much of
[10:57] the belief that as long as there has no
[11:00] monopolies like why should what is the
[11:03] role in there now we have so much
[11:05] interference and not even Capital itself
[11:08] not even money itself is is free and
[11:11] then they have in Austria our new
[11:13] government is now uh implementing a a
[11:17] rent stop noral rent increases I think
[11:20] only like 1% this year and like 2% next
[11:23] year you can increase it something like
[11:25] that which is obviously it's not curing
[11:28] the ca of increase rent it's just curing
[11:31] the symptom or like the consequence of
[11:33] it uh which is uh really weird that that
[11:38] people think that actually helps but
[11:40] it's it's uh I don't I don't know where
[11:43] I wanted to go with that but it's really
[11:44] interesting to to think about a Bitcoin
[11:47] world where all of the sudden you you
[11:49] don't have a centralized government do
[11:51] you think we get there do the world
[11:54] where there's no Central uh printer I
[11:56] don't think so I I mean let's let's
[11:59] first think about what you mean by we
[12:01] like I don't I don't think there is a we
[12:04] in humankind there is you and me and
[12:08] then there's you know friendship I guess
[12:10] it's best defined by people who have
[12:12] aligned incentives and work together to
[12:15] to reach a common goal so I think that
[12:19] since the dawn of man has has been the
[12:21] driving force you know Nash equilibrium
[12:24] people for themselves working together
[12:27] because that way they can attain you
[12:29] know more things for themselves so it's
[12:31] purely selfish act all through and
[12:33] through so I think to answer your
[12:36] question I don't think uh Humanity as a
[12:38] collective in fact I think there might
[12:40] be something of a first hard Fork of
[12:43] humanity because of Technology not only
[12:46] Bitcoin but you know internet Noster all
[12:49] these Technologies encryption that allow
[12:52] sort of like a I guess now we would call
[12:55] it a shadow
[12:56] society but it may it depends on your
[12:59] perspective right if you live in The
[13:00] Shadow Society then you might call the
[13:04] other Society a clown world or whatever
[13:05] you choose to call it so I think this
[13:08] will happen and it's already happening
[13:10] like people are already regulatory
[13:12] shopping through multiple passports
[13:15] having a company in one country living
[13:17] in another and then you know having a
[13:19] third one it it has become very easy to
[13:23] avoid violence and this is something
[13:25] that sovereign individual makes a makes
[13:28] absolutely great case if you haven't
[13:30] read it I I highly recommend it written
[13:32] in
[13:32] 97 beautiful book one of my favorites
[13:36] and it makes the case how the nation
[13:39] state will no longer be needed like the
[13:42] reason for nation state has been
[13:45] throughout history to provide mostly
[13:48] Security Services for the clients which
[13:51] are citizens and now the clients are no
[13:54] longer treated as clients they're
[13:56] treated like cattle or you know some
[13:59] something to pump out of value pump
[14:01] value out out from something that has no
[14:04] rights but has a lot of
[14:06] obligations so the government should not
[14:10] dictate like they they they cannot give
[14:12] you anything they they take away they
[14:15] limit your freedoms like you are born
[14:17] free and then they start limiting you so
[14:20] this is something that is is rather new
[14:23] uh also a byproduct of Information Age
[14:26] because now it is possible to influence
[14:28] uh large groups of humans all at once
[14:32] and this is also um to go back to your
[14:35] original question why I think that Fiat
[14:38] is not going to go in that sense away
[14:41] because there's always these tools and
[14:43] there's always these customers who are
[14:45] willing to buy whatever these um you
[14:47] know snakes o o oil pedalers are selling
[14:51] as long as the story is good right as
[14:53] long as they the customers think that
[14:56] they are getting what they want and now
[14:58] the customers are thinking like taxation
[15:01] is H taxes are the price that you pay
[15:03] for living in a civilized society well
[15:07] this has been uh in the recent past
[15:11] maybe crumbling a little bit and I think
[15:13] people are starting to realize that
[15:15] maybe it's not fully true maybe it's not
[15:17] true at all maybe it's the
[15:19] opposite and at the same time technology
[15:22] allows individuals to defend themselves
[15:24] better and this is something from
[15:25] sovereign individual as well you know
[15:27] they predicted um you know internet they
[15:29] predict the Bitcoin 3D printers
[15:32] essentially so it becomes much more
[15:35] difficult to attack the individual and
[15:37] this is why the security services that
[15:41] nation states use to provide are no
[15:43] longer needed by a subset of humankind
[15:47] so this is what I mean by the hard work
[15:49] of humanity I think the
[15:52] majority most of the humans will still
[15:55] prefer to Outsource the responsibility
[15:59] and then there's people like us maybe
[16:01] who prefer to embrace personal
[16:04] responsibility and use those tools to
[16:07] attain maximum freedom and protect it at
[16:09] all costs while the other party engages
[16:13] in you know followership like
[16:17] the it's a very old thing like Plato
[16:20] already had this like this uh Cave
[16:24] um
[16:26] allegory where there's this ruling class
[16:30] that dictate what the the bottom class
[16:33] will see and the bottom class like you
[16:35] have to work really hard and you have to
[16:38] want
[16:39] to appearer out of the cave but I
[16:43] suspect that most people will prefer to
[16:45] stay in the cave if you if you know what
[16:47] I mean yes and it's something that
[16:51] actually came up right in the previous
[16:53] episode that that I recorded where uh we
[16:56] discussed how people are not
[17:00] sometimes people don't want freedom they
[17:02] they prefer to have something above them
[17:05] they prefer for have for them to have
[17:08] something above them but they also want
[17:10] to they put that also onto all the other
[17:12] ones because they are scared if someone
[17:15] is free and living a good life because
[17:17] there it's their own insecurity but
[17:19] that's a a whole another Rabbit Hole of
[17:22] of are people ready to to take down
[17:25] freedom in the hand in in terms of like
[17:28] getting the Bitcoin self custody and and
[17:30] running their own notes and stuff like
[17:31] that I I I personally think not most
[17:35] people are cozy and most people will use
[17:37] even if if they use Bitcoin they they
[17:39] probably won't even notice that Bitcoin
[17:42] is on on the back end of it we can see a
[17:45] little bit already on Nostra there are
[17:46] people on Nostra that are not familiar
[17:49] with Bitcoin it's small group but they
[17:51] are there uh and uh it will probably
[17:54] happen the same way as people are not
[17:56] familiar with tcpip and they still use
[17:58] Facebook Facebook and and and WhatsApp
[18:00] and and YouTube uh and they they they
[18:03] will continue to but they don't need to
[18:05] know uh how to set up their own email
[18:08] servers or or something like that they
[18:10] just use Gmail and maybe the same thing
[18:13] happens to bitcoin where the majority
[18:15] uses custodians uh and only a small
[18:19] group that takes their freedom and
[18:21] sovereignty really serious they are the
[18:24] ones actually caring about oh like where
[18:27] where did this Bitcoin come from from uh
[18:29] do they know who I am like basically the
[18:32] KC argument uh is is is that my control
[18:36] or does the keys is the controls of the
[18:38] keys somewhere else I don't know like
[18:40] how much H sometimes I feel like there's
[18:43] a a big Revolution going on of
[18:46] empowering individuals but at the same
[18:48] time it's like people want to stay cozy
[18:51] do do you think that that could be a big
[18:53] Revolution going on where a lot of
[18:55] people wake up and and get to that
[18:57] freedom or
[18:59] is it just because we in a or I in a in
[19:02] a bubble and uh most my
[19:05] friends get towards more of a freedom
[19:08] and sovereignty
[19:09] mindset I think a little bit both I I I
[19:12] think you're right on the money when you
[19:15] say that people don't want self- custody
[19:18] they want better custodians and I think
[19:20] this is what they're going to get as
[19:21] well because people who do care about
[19:24] doing things so-called right in our
[19:26] opinion at least they do do build those
[19:29] businesses they they do build those
[19:31] services that they want to use and they
[19:34] think are proper and the only thing they
[19:37] have to do is provide a better service
[19:40] to the normal people the normal consumer
[19:42] so they will switch to that service that
[19:45] as simple as that like you said they
[19:46] won't know what's running underneath
[19:48] they won't care if it's Bitcoin or
[19:50] Diamond points or whatever as long as
[19:53] they get what they want and I think the
[19:55] same goes with with uh with States I
[19:58] think the the states are going to be
[20:01] decreased because there's no longer
[20:04] nobody can afford to compete with high
[20:08] overheads as as as a country right so it
[20:12] must at least decrease the size of
[20:15] different governments so sort of a
[20:16] global balcon isation what happened in
[20:19] the you know when Once the Soviet Union
[20:21] started you know breaking into pieces I
[20:25] think in in global scale this will
[20:27] happen and what we will see is some sort
[20:30] of city state like this is an old idea
[20:33] as well that has been working when there
[20:34] were less humans and now because of
[20:36] information a and technology and you
[20:38] know steel and gasoline we've been able
[20:41] to create much bigger
[20:44] Empires that work on Fiat money which if
[20:48] that's going to go away or it's not
[20:51] probably it's not going to go all the
[20:52] way out but there will be options and
[20:55] this is the crucial difference for
[20:58] anything that everything else is the
[20:59] same but now we have the option to
[21:02] create something better to really
[21:04] compete with the old nation state but it
[21:07] used to be the certainty death and taxes
[21:10] right and that is no longer the
[21:12] certainty we have the original
[21:14] alternative which is which is free
[21:16] market collaboration between free people
[21:19] so we go back to private contracts
[21:22] instead of loss you know you break the
[21:25] contract you're out of the city as
[21:26] simple as that you instead of being born
[21:29] and sort of underwriting this invisible
[21:33] contract that you are now property of
[21:35] the state and you get a slave number and
[21:37] then somehow they have to get you into
[21:39] debt to be able to pay their own bills
[21:41] and and uh expand further instead of
[21:44] that you actually go to a city you
[21:47] choose from the variety of different
[21:50] places that you might want to live in
[21:52] that provide you the services and then
[21:53] you pay for the service so it's just
[21:56] like a service contract or a
[21:57] subscription that is is a very popular
[22:00] thing nowadays I think that's going to
[22:01] be a very attractive model to many
[22:04] people especially People Like Us who
[22:06] know what we want and we don't want to
[22:08] pay some kind of like
[22:11] weird you know um Al money for for the
[22:15] other people to use the money that we
[22:18] have no control over we want to have
[22:20] control over what we actually pay and
[22:23] what we get and I think this is the
[22:25] option that is going to be um a game
[22:28] changer
[22:29] but we are quite far off from that in my
[22:31] opinion like I think people are
[22:33] overestimating the short-term power of
[22:36] what Bitcoin can do and maybe
[22:38] underestimating the long-term power what
[22:40] it can do like it might be couple more
[22:42] Generations as it usually is before
[22:44] something truly breaks through and then
[22:46] of course even after Bitcoin has become
[22:49] common place we'll still have this you
[22:52] know hundreds of years of
[22:54] baggage from from the previous Empire
[22:57] that sort of has to disintegrate to some
[23:00] some degree and change into something
[23:02] better but I do think like I I feel very
[23:05] optimistic about the future sometimes
[23:07] doesn't sound like that maybe uh it's
[23:10] just that maybe my time preference is is
[23:14] lowering even more than than it used to
[23:17] be I'm not concerned about the Bitcoin
[23:20] price at all I'm I'm more concerned
[23:23] about creating
[23:25] infrastructure uh contraptions
[23:28] that make staying free and protecting
[23:31] Freedom easy because easy convenience
[23:36] this is these are the things that most
[23:37] people are looking for and once we have
[23:40] that and we present that option I do
[23:42] believe that people are going to choose
[23:43] that
[23:44] option and uh it's very right what you
[23:47] say with uh with uh governments
[23:49] decreasing and we we can literally see
[23:52] that right now uh with example in
[23:55] America with Toge we can see that even
[23:57] in Austria the current government is is
[24:00] decreasing spending and cutting spending
[24:02] a lot and they even having someone in
[24:04] place that looks now at uh uh where are
[24:09] over regulations and where are things we
[24:11] we can cut back there a own state
[24:13] Secretary secretary for that now uh and
[24:16] Germany also the newly elected uh guy
[24:19] said that we have to cut down on
[24:21] spending we spending way too much as a
[24:24] government so I feel like and this was
[24:26] not popular like just a few years ago
[24:29] when you he in politics just a few years
[24:31] ago um there were there was not that
[24:35] popular saying of like we have to cut
[24:37] spending of of government at least what
[24:39] I saw and now it's it's getting to be
[24:42] like oh yeah like everyone knows we have
[24:45] to cut spending because we cannot keep
[24:48] expanding our debt on a government level
[24:51] because that brings out like other
[24:53] problems with inflation and and then the
[24:55] currency system breaks down so it feels
[24:58] like governments and those are slowly
[25:01] and and we are probably overestimating
[25:03] the speed of it but slowly uh beginning
[25:06] to to understand what they they have to
[25:09] do uh and we are entering that um that
[25:12] new area of uh of less less uh
[25:16] institutions and more individuals if you
[25:19] will
[25:20] so yeah I think you're right I I think
[25:23] well at least the ones that want to
[25:25] remain in competition like you us has
[25:29] been leading the global competition for
[25:32] quite a while and I think they're
[25:35] probably a little bit intimidated by the
[25:37] developments in in the East mainly China
[25:40] so those are like two superpowers now in
[25:43] competition of global dominance in a
[25:46] way and funnily enough the the key to
[25:50] winning that competition is
[25:52] decreasing in in government size right
[25:56] and propping up the the sovereign
[25:59] individual and their opportunities
[26:00] that's the American dream right
[26:02] everybody can make their own fate and
[26:04] their own money and their own
[26:07] Freedom
[26:09] so yeah
[26:11] counterintuitively you will win this
[26:13] race as a nation state by decreasing
[26:15] your overhead decreasing your the size
[26:18] of your government giving more freedom
[26:20] uh to the people rather you know
[26:22] releasing the restraints like I said
[26:25] before you can't really give Freedom
[26:26] you're already free and then you get
[26:28] that you
[26:29] know your freedom gets decreased so
[26:32] lifting those limitations from
[26:34] individuals I think that is that is a
[26:37] revelation that a lot of uh country
[26:39] foremans are going to have very soon and
[26:43] those who don't are going to simply be
[26:45] left out of the
[26:46] competition yeah I love that framing of
[26:49] like we are free as humans and then uh
[26:53] the restrictions are going are coming on
[26:56] to us so like the the the actual human
[26:59] beings like we are actually um free all
[27:02] the time but their limitations are kind
[27:05] of set in in front of us so it's not
[27:08] getting us more freedom is it's like the
[27:11] removing the
[27:13] limitations from us I like that but not
[27:16] not as we as we said like not everyone
[27:19] is is ready for that and uh I think
[27:22] that's why also as you said in the
[27:24] beginning you don't actively bring up
[27:26] Bitcoin in conversations uh and I very
[27:28] much also do exactly that I mean uh for
[27:31] me it's like everyone knows I'm the
[27:34] Bitcoin guy so Bitcoin comes in
[27:35] conversations just because I'm on the
[27:37] table usually uh so I don't have to do
[27:40] it now uh but uh I saw that those who
[27:44] are ready for Bitcoin and those are
[27:47] actually interested just come to me um
[27:50] uh privately or DM me or like call me
[27:53] and like hey like can you explain this
[27:54] Bitcoin thing for me uh and those are
[27:57] ready and like they actually going
[27:59] deeper uh and and the other ones are not
[28:02] interested in and so it it actually does
[28:04] not work to the orange build people
[28:07] actively in in that regard they have to
[28:10] be also open and willing to to to learn
[28:14] otherwise it's it's just uh a waste of
[28:16] time and maybe you even push them
[28:18] further away from Bitcoin if you try to
[28:20] Orange pull them too hard because then
[28:22] they're like ah why does he want so
[28:24] badly that I'm in Bitcoin it's like uh
[28:27] you you want to push me know like they
[28:29] should get pulled in and not pushing
[28:32] them in like in in a way it's kind of
[28:36] irresponsible to lightly orange build
[28:38] somebody because let's say that you
[28:40] orange build somebody at uh at 20K in
[28:44] 2017 when it hit the top right and they
[28:47] buy and then it goes to 3K and they sell
[28:51] and you're the dick obviously because
[28:53] you you got them in and then it goes to
[28:55] 100K and they're never going to be able
[28:57] to recover from that right because in
[28:59] the end you were
[29:01] right and uh you know their time Horizon
[29:04] was too short they are the ones that
[29:07]  it up and it takes a
[29:10] a different kind of a human than most
[29:13] people are I think to be able to look
[29:15] into the mirror and and admit that you
[29:19] you've been wrong and the older you are
[29:21] the more invested you are in in the
[29:23] lives that you
[29:24] lived and the belief that you held it is
[29:28] different very very difficult to break
[29:30] those chains and shatter those chains
[29:32] and say that hey you know I done goofed
[29:36] um I need to learn more about this I
[29:38] need to I need a fresh start but a lot
[29:40] of people focus on the price and this is
[29:42] also why I don't like ngu uh anymore
[29:45] like it's obvious that if a finite
[29:47] absolutely finite asset has any use as
[29:50] time approaches Infinity so does the
[29:52] valuation of that asset that much is
[29:55] obvious it's a math mathematical truth
[29:57] so so NG does go up but I I would like
[30:01] not to focus on the price at all like
[30:04] you should be focusing on how you can
[30:06] build something lasting how you can
[30:08] build something that generates
[30:11] usefulness to people how can you be
[30:12] useful to people stacking sets and
[30:14] staying humble that's not going to solve
[30:16] anything unless you're
[30:17] solving actively solving problems for
[30:20] other human beings that's how you never
[30:22] go hungry and then yeah of course you
[30:24] want to earn Bitcoin directly or you
[30:26] want to convert your earnings into
[30:28] Bitcoin the heart asset and hold on to
[30:30] that sure that is saving that's that's
[30:32] just you know prudent Human
[30:34] Action but I think a lot of people
[30:38] myself included when we orange build
[30:40] people we focus too much on the factor
[30:43] that hey you buy now and five you hold
[30:45] five years and then you know you make
[30:47] this much gains I think that can be very
[30:50] damaging because that is gambling that
[30:53] that is trading and and this is sure if
[30:56] if that's your profession I have nothing
[30:57] against that but most people are not apt
[30:59] for that kind of thing sort of like
[31:01] playing poker you can do it for fun but
[31:04] I wouldn't lead with that um I think
[31:07] something that resonates much more with
[31:09] people that I start to see even in
[31:11] normic conversation is like what is
[31:13] inflation you know why do the prices
[31:16] keep going up these are much more
[31:18] powerful ideas and you don't even have
[31:20] to mention Bitcoin at all I how I got
[31:24] into these ideas was I watched the movie
[31:27] called Z guys
[31:28] I don't know if you know that from 2009
[31:31] I believe that laid the case for you
[31:33] know the modern money mechanics and
[31:35] inflation quite well so I understood the
[31:37] problem I just didn't understand that
[31:39] there was a solution for it so I think a
[31:42] lot of people will understand this
[31:44] problem because they see it uh every day
[31:47] in their life but if you are offering
[31:50] them sort of a solution to a problem
[31:52] that they maybe don't have like yeah
[31:56] everybody kind of wants to be Rich sure
[31:59] but usually when you say that you buy
[32:01] this and then later you're rich that
[32:03] kind of comes off wrong right I mean
[32:05] that that people should be suspicious of
[32:07] that and then you you can't guarantee
[32:10] that either because the incentives to
[32:14] acquire that finite asset are immense
[32:17] Global incentives for that so there's a
[32:20] lot of powerful parties that will not
[32:23] have in their best interest for the
[32:24] price to climb too high and then there's
[32:26] the convenience part people love
[32:28] convenience so they don't mind buying
[32:30] IOU Bitcoins like I I bet a lot of the
[32:33] market currently um is you know just
[32:37] exual sheet basically keeping track of
[32:38] people's balances and doing fractional
[32:41] Reserve because nobody cares to verify
[32:44] if they actually have that money or not
[32:46] and I think this is going to be an
[32:47] increasing problem well problem in the
[32:49] sense that if you think the ngu way and
[32:51] if you think in the terms of like oh
[32:53] Supply Supply shock is coming and it's
[32:56] going to Rocket Bitcoin to the Moon
[32:58] and maybe it's not maybe bitcoin price
[33:00] just goes up because people like
[33:02] speculating and it doesn't matter if
[33:04] it's I you Bitcoin or it's a real
[33:06] Bitcoin of course it matters to People
[33:08] Like Us who take self- custody it's a
[33:10] great opportunity in fact when Bitcoin
[33:12] goes down you can stack more and you can
[33:14] put it in the cold and it will be good
[33:16] for you but I I think this kind of like
[33:21] Omega candle this kind of talk about
[33:24] Bitcoin going up really fast really
[33:26] quickly during our lifetimes it's maybe
[33:30] not what you should be saying I think
[33:32] what you should be saying is are you
[33:35] free you know is your salary buying the
[33:39] same as it used to more or less you know
[33:42] these are the questions that make people
[33:44] think without pushing you kind of like
[33:47] your your agenda and people are great at
[33:50] picking up when somebody is doing better
[33:52] than you right they inherently
[33:55] understand that okay this is probably
[33:57] something from the DNA like the compet
[34:00] competition um that somebody's doing
[34:03] somebody's better off somebody's more
[34:05] free and you can't figure out how so
[34:07] that kind of creates dissonance in
[34:10] yourself and and unrest and usually you
[34:13] lash out to those people because you
[34:15] know you you get jealous and it's not
[34:17] very productive to do that like jealousy
[34:19] can be productive when if you think that
[34:21] oh I want that as well and then you go
[34:23] to talk to that guy like you said some
[34:25] people they they do approach you and
[34:26] they want to know like what are you
[34:28] doing like how how did you reach that
[34:31] position in life and then you can tell
[34:33] them you can clue them in because now
[34:35] they have the the
[34:36] spark but I think that needs to come
[34:39] from the people themselves
[34:41] so yeah I think I've been taking the
[34:43] direction lately to talk about these
[34:46] topics that inevitably lead to bitcoin
[34:50] as the
[34:51] solution instead of offering the
[34:53] solution right away to a problem that
[34:54] people don't realize they have let's
[34:56] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[34:58] the beauty that coin vigilante has made
[35:02] with the Bitcoin watches those watches
[35:04] are the most amazing the most elegent
[35:07] way of showing that you are a true
[35:10] bitcoiner and coin vigilante just
[35:12] dropped a completely new and amazing
[35:15] Genesis edition of their watch
[35:18] collections you have the date of the
[35:20] first ever Mind Bitcoin Block in there
[35:24] and of course also the block height and
[35:26] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[35:30] level of detail they put in in this
[35:32] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[35:35] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[35:38] in the descriptions I love those watches
[35:40] so so much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[35:44] really do hope that you don't have it on
[35:46] Exchange but if you do have it on
[35:48] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[35:50] with that the first way is you put it on
[35:53] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[35:55] you to get into the self custody game I
[35:59] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[36:02] for that it's a super simple and secure
[36:05] way and if you check out the link in the
[36:07] description you even get 5% off if you
[36:10] use the code Robin and the second way is
[36:13] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[36:16] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[36:19] most out of your sovereignty they will
[36:22] personalize for you a self custody setup
[36:25] that is perfect for your individual
[36:28] situation they will show you how you can
[36:31] secure your own devices securing your
[36:33] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[36:35] keep all your devices secure one topic
[36:38] that is overlooked often is the
[36:40] inheritance plan what happens with your
[36:43] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[36:46] you have a plan for that in place
[36:48] already and last but not least if you're
[36:50] in a jurisdictions where you don't feel
[36:53] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[36:56] that head over to Bitcoin way.com
[37:00] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[37:03] just a quick side note I will be for the
[37:06] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[37:09] prag event in June it will be absolutely
[37:12] legendary and I'm really looking forward
[37:14] to seeing all of you there you can get
[37:17] your ticket in the link down in the
[37:19] description of Bitcoin brag and very
[37:21] important use code Robin to get 10% off
[37:25] your ticket I'm really looking forward
[37:27] seeing you there that's a great point
[37:29] and and I like the orange building as a
[37:31] role model system um because people come
[37:35] to you and and I think that's the best
[37:37] thing bitcoiners can do live the best
[37:40] life you can possibly live uh and uh
[37:45] make them
[37:46] aware that some of that came because of
[37:50] Bitcoin uh and and people naturally will
[37:53] connect those those two things I mean
[37:55] maybe you don't even have to tell them
[37:58] about Bitcoin because maybe uh they will
[38:00] just ask you like where do you save your
[38:02] money H and and they don't even know
[38:04] that you're Bitcoin and then all of the
[38:06] sudden you're like oh like I put it in
[38:08] Bitcoin and just like so so so like
[38:10] being a role model and living a great
[38:13] live is probably the most effective
[38:16] orange spilling strategy for for you and
[38:20] because people are naturally uh going to
[38:24] to towards that H and and I want to get
[38:27] into a little bit I wanted wanted to get
[38:29] way earlier in that but I think it's
[38:31] it's really interesting um of like how
[38:33] we can prepare for for those things
[38:35] because you're writing now on that and
[38:37] and you already dropped some some things
[38:40] uh here and there uh but I think it's
[38:41] really important that uh we we
[38:45] understand hling might not be enough uh
[38:48] what else can we do and how can we
[38:50] prepare for something that that might
[38:52] happen down the road in the field
[38:55] system yeah I think one of the most
[38:58] important thing in preparation prepping
[39:01] so-called is managing your
[39:04] expectations like what do you expect
[39:07] expect that is going to happen um if you
[39:09] have low expectations there's a high
[39:12] probability that you won't be
[39:13] disappointed in life so that's number
[39:16] one thing um don't disappoint Yourself
[39:19] by having higher expectations than you
[39:22] should maybe also you know you don't
[39:24] need to be overly pessimistic and
[39:26] negative that's not not my point it's
[39:29] just manage your expectations maybe you
[39:32] know nation state adoption is not all
[39:35] good because Bitcoin can be used for
[39:37] surveillance and stuff maybe you should
[39:38] not be cheering for nation states
[39:41] adopting Bitcoin at this point maybe
[39:43] it's it's not great maybe you should
[39:46] instead focus on how you can make
[39:49] yourself and your family more free and
[39:51] and safe and another thing
[39:53] is um you know stacking sets and staying
[39:57] home which is something I said earlier
[39:59] this is a poorly thought out meme in my
[40:02] my opinion and also it can be kind of
[40:07] damaging um because it's it's kind of
[40:09] leads to this slave mentality in a way a
[40:14] lot of people that I know are still
[40:16] stuck in their Fiat a lot of them quit
[40:18] actually recently but a lot of people
[40:21] are stuck in their deadend Fiat jobs
[40:24] just to stack sets and and to So-Cal
[40:26] stay humble humble and then sort of
[40:28] waiting for this magical moon to appear
[40:31] out as if out of nowhere so what I like
[40:34] to say is quit your job and get to work
[40:37] what I mean is a job is something that
[40:40] you go into and exchange your time your
[40:43] free time for money which is fine
[40:46] especially when you're young and you
[40:48] don't have experience but work is
[40:50] something that you do just for the work
[40:53] just to be useful just to find
[40:55] fulfillment so if you can do that and
[40:58] get paid in Bitcoin like that's that's
[41:00] the dream right so I I would just
[41:03] encourage people to start thinking in
[41:05] those
[41:05] terms because there are ways that you
[41:08] can especially with the um Information
[41:11] Age tools I quite confident that
[41:14] everybody has this specific skill set
[41:16] that they can monetize and then find
[41:18] ways to convert that income those cash
[41:21] flows into
[41:23] Bitcoin and I think this is something
[41:26] that you know stack ATS stay humble
[41:28] misses by and I've seen it many times
[41:32] when these people and myself included
[41:35] when we quit the Fiat habit when we quit
[41:37] the Fiat job the 9
[41:40] to5 I mean you can still work 9 to5 if
[41:43] you want but you know what I mean like
[41:45] once you get out of that hamsters wheel
[41:49] you start to feel way better and you
[41:50] start to feel more productive you can
[41:53] get more new ideas you are free to do
[41:55] every every morning when you wake up you
[41:57] decide what time what are you going to
[41:59] be working on that day all day and being
[42:01] useful to people and getting paid in
[42:03] sets like that's I I I want to encourage
[42:06] people to explore their personal
[42:09] specific skill set maybe you studied for
[42:12] it maybe you didn't maybe it's something
[42:13] that has been your hobby all your life
[42:15] and just never realized that it can be a
[42:18] profession as well now profession does
[42:20] not come from institutionalized
[42:22] education necessarily in fact I would
[42:25] argue that most of the time it doesn't
[42:27] you know I have formal education as well
[42:30] but that's not really necessarily what I
[42:33] want to do it is something that I can do
[42:35] and something that I do on occasion but
[42:39] is it something that I would choose to
[42:42] do if I didn't have to probably not and
[42:45] and this is something that goes with the
[42:47] preparation and this will help you in
[42:50] the next step which will be the survival
[42:52] because maybe you will be out of job you
[42:54] will most likely be out of job if you're
[42:56] in in some especially if you're working
[42:57] for government right me a lot of people
[43:00] are still working on government for for
[43:02] government and um stacking sets on the
[43:04] side
[43:06] so it also goes to the managing the
[43:09] expectations like you can't expect that
[43:11] to continue so what then what what is
[43:14] your contingency plan how you're going
[43:17] to leverage your personal specific skill
[43:20] set to stay ahead well first of all to
[43:23] stay alive and support your family but
[43:25] also to stay ahead like
[43:27] coming up with those new ways of
[43:30] monetizing your Human Action your
[43:32] personal action what are the steps that
[43:34] they taking now so I encourage everybody
[43:36] to ask themselves that question it's a
[43:39] it's a super interesting one and there
[43:41] are there are two things um first thing
[43:44] I'm really interested in it how do you
[43:46] think in general because there's a trend
[43:49] towards
[43:50] freelancing smaller entrepreneurs of
[43:54] like like two three five people
[43:57] companies uh even like maybe like under
[43:59] 20 people companies like they get more
[44:02] and more popular you see those Trends
[44:04] all over the world uh uh and also like
[44:08] even remote work and freelancing um how
[44:11] do you think Bitcoin and the information
[44:14] age age in general will impact that is
[44:18] it like uh smaller and smaller companies
[44:20] the same as as government's decrease the
[44:23] the company sizes decrease also and in
[44:25] more smaller comp departments that have
[44:28] just working uh closely together I think
[44:32] so and I think this is something that we
[44:34] are we are seeing right now smaller
[44:37] freelancer collectives or whatever you
[44:39] want to call them you know small small
[44:42] groups of people working on a very
[44:44] specific problem whether it be
[44:45] development or publishing like my
[44:48] company consensus network is what I call
[44:50] the starfish organization so it's like
[44:53] very very uh dist distributed the people
[44:56] who are working on our projects live all
[44:59] around the world and I don't know what
[45:02] most of the time is happening even or
[45:04] what projects are are we so-called we
[45:06] working it doesn't really matter because
[45:09] everybody is kind of working for
[45:11] themselves and they are creating these
[45:13] little units with people who can help
[45:15] them do and reach the the goal get for
[45:19] example getting a book in a certain
[45:20] language takes a team right usually it's
[45:23] not a one one person job so then you
[45:27] find that person to do it with you and
[45:29] then you find the framework that that we
[45:32] created for example for that and they
[45:34] can use it and it sort of becomes its
[45:36] own thing and starts to live on its own
[45:39] and this is a much more resilient and
[45:42] antifragile uh way just like Bitcoin you
[45:44] know we have these nodes and groups of
[45:46] nodes and we have mining pools it's the
[45:49] same principle and I think the same
[45:51] thing is going to happen what we talked
[45:52] before like with city states you know
[45:54] government level action instead of
[45:56] having these massive governments with
[45:59] huge overheads same goes for the
[46:02] companies let's say you know companies
[46:04] like Amazon are they Doo big big to fail
[46:07] I think they are too big to succeed in
[46:10] in the future world right because they
[46:13] won't be able to compete much longer
[46:15] with that kind of
[46:17] overhead and if that you try to
[46:20] centralize a huge operation like that
[46:23] you are bound to run into inefficiencies
[46:26] and this is you why communism doesn't
[46:28] work either so I think the Freedom
[46:32] Movement is on the rise it is a trend
[46:35] definitely that I see
[46:37] freelancing I'm I'm never going to have
[46:40] an employee again in my any of my
[46:42] companies because there's no need for
[46:44] that it's much more clean to have uh you
[46:47] know solo entrepreneurs or small
[46:49] companies that work together and I think
[46:51] the same will be true um for city states
[46:54] just small places of like the people
[46:57] that want to live a certain lifestyle
[46:59] with certain level of service getting
[47:02] together because you know makes a lot of
[47:04] sense for them not because they were
[47:05] born in a certain area and they have to
[47:08] this used to be the case most of
[47:09] humanity you were born in somewhere um
[47:12] you you hang out with the same people
[47:14] all your life you go to the same school
[47:16] you work there and you die there this
[47:18] has not been true for the past couple
[47:21] decades at
[47:24] least but it takes time very interesting
[47:28] I also like uh I I I say employee but
[47:32] like I have uh just two people that are
[47:35] Solo
[47:36] entrepreneurs uh that that working uh
[47:40] with me on on project but they both also
[47:43] work on other things uh and and and so I
[47:46] think that's a really a really great and
[47:48] efficient way to to work together
[47:51] because they are specialized in that
[47:52] thing and and they bring a lot of
[47:54] experience even from other project in to
[47:56] my project because they also work on
[47:58] other things uh but in the same
[48:00] discipline so it's a really great thing
[48:02] of like connecting uh in a decentralized
[48:05] way uh and and then you just have to
[48:09] Once set up a process of how you work
[48:11] together and they are both far away from
[48:14] me they're both not in Austria not even
[48:16] in Europe uh so and it's so easy uh and
[48:19] we don't have to have a daily standup
[48:22] meeting because we know what we do we
[48:24] set up a process and it works m
[48:26] magically and it's really cool uh and so
[48:30] uh that it's like almost no
[48:33] overhead uh and uh it's is it's just
[48:37] like the the the you just place the
[48:40] right um things how are the things
[48:44] called I only know the English word the
[48:47] German word for it but the you just
[48:49] place the right puzzle pieces together
[48:51] and they're working on its own and it
[48:54] totally makes sense if you look at it
[48:56] because there's like a product like a a
[48:58] podcast coming out in the end of it uh
[49:01] but the the puzzle pieces to that they
[49:03] coming together on its own and there's
[49:05] no need to build a headquarter in
[49:08] Austria with like 50 employees and that
[49:11] I think it's an old system yeah it's the
[49:14] original it emerges from from nothing um
[49:17] Anarchy basically Anarchy does not equal
[49:20] chaos it just means that you don't have
[49:24] centralized
[49:25] leadership one of my favorite examples
[49:28] is the the Amazon Indians that have
[49:31] leadership as this Chiefs non tons they
[49:35] were called so what happens is that one
[49:38] of these Chiefs is a very good Hunter
[49:42] and it makes sense for these other
[49:44] tribes members to follow him because
[49:46] he's so good so we were talking about
[49:49] leadership by example and being a role
[49:51] model this is the original way to learn
[49:54] and collaborate and find leadership and
[49:57] The crucial difference is that the
[49:58] leader does not Choose You you choose
[50:01] the leader right you choose whose
[50:04] example and whose way are you going to
[50:06] follow and if it's not going to be you
[50:09] it's going to be someone else and you
[50:11] can choose to follow whoever you want as
[50:14] long as you want and if you decide that
[50:17] this role model is no longer working for
[50:20] what you want or your your goals change
[50:22] so you can change leadership which is
[50:25] not true currently in in big companies
[50:28] or can be very difficult to change
[50:31] change leaders or leave that position
[50:34] and even more so in nation state con uh
[50:38] you know in the concept of nation state
[50:40] it's it's even more difficult because
[50:42] you're even more invested in being a sub
[50:45] subject of someone rather than choosing
[50:48] who you want to follow even though you
[50:50] always had that option it's just become
[50:52] infinitely more easy with Information
[50:55] Age tools to do that absolutely Ely and
[50:57] you talk about those three stages of
[50:59] like prepare survive and and Thrive uh
[51:04] before we have we can survive there
[51:06] there has to be some sort of uh crash or
[51:09] some sort of of of event how do you look
[51:13] at like how will that look like
[51:15] obviously it's it's impossible to to
[51:16] know exactly but what are you imagining
[51:19] there well we we have some you know
[51:23] historical examples like for example in
[51:25] Argentina 20 one um there's a book
[51:28] written about that it's called how to
[51:30] survive economic
[51:32] collapse I kind of recommend that book
[51:36] but it's not a happy read it will show
[51:38] you firsthand what happens when the
[51:42] so-called illusionary safety nets fall
[51:45] apart because like we taught before you
[51:48] know the original reason why nation
[51:50] states exist is to provide security in
[51:52] exchange for taxes and you know it works
[51:55] until it doesn't and once it stops
[51:58] working this is what's going to happen
[52:00] there's going to be riots there's going
[52:01] to be looting there's going to be people
[52:04] you know killing each other for for a
[52:06] piece of bread once their money is no
[52:08] longer good to feed their family people
[52:11] become what well what people are
[52:14] animals and there there won't be lost
[52:17] the police will not be there to help you
[52:18] another example from the 90s would be
[52:20] the rooftop Koreans I don't know if you
[52:22] know about that in in Los Angeles where
[52:26] you know this uh riots broke up and and
[52:29] the the shop owners the Koreans uh had
[52:32] to defend their shops from the rooftops
[52:34] with with you know guns and and uh build
[52:38] up their own defenses so that was going
[52:40] back to the basics so we are living in
[52:43] an illusion in a sky castle that is very
[52:48] penetrable it gives you the false sense
[52:51] of security which is much more dangerous
[52:54] than actual Freedom people are much more
[52:56] afraid of actual freedom but if
[52:59] you compare a lion in a cage in a zoo to
[53:03] a
[53:04] lion in the in the wild that has no
[53:06] guarantees if it's going to be killed
[53:09] the next day or if it's going to find a
[53:10] meal or a mate these are all sort of
[53:14] guaranteed when you're when you're a
[53:15] captive but which one is
[53:18] thriving which one do you want to
[53:22] be yeah and it's I mean uh I I think
[53:26] it's it's great because I can really
[53:28] personally relate because I was
[53:31] literally uh exactly one year ago uh on
[53:35] like 1 of March was my or like the 28th
[53:38] of February last year was literally my
[53:41] last day at work uh and since then I
[53:44] completely left that behind uh and since
[53:48] that uh yes I now make more money than
[53:51] than I did before and and and I have
[53:53] more more freedom and and all those
[53:55] those good things um uh but there's also
[53:58] a price like you you you have to to to
[54:02] care for your money more like my money
[54:05] uh thinking really changed in in one
[54:08] year because all of the sudden um it's
[54:11] not a guaranteed that the next month
[54:14] like the salary is coming you really get
[54:16] used to like oh the salary is coming
[54:18] like you spend differently if if you
[54:21] have to earn every Euro yourself and you
[54:23] have to argue and negotiate and and all
[54:25] those things but the biggest thing
[54:27] actually that came from that for me was
[54:31] the
[54:32] creativity of having the freedom I
[54:35] needed a solid three to four months to
[54:37] get used to it like a three to four
[54:39] months to get used to I'm there's nobody
[54:42] above me there's there's no guard rails
[54:45] but once you find yourself working in
[54:49] that
[54:49] environment and you you you have a
[54:53] switch and all of the sudden uh
[54:56] everything thing go like there's so much
[54:58] creativity and and so much um ideas
[55:02] coming that I have days where I stand up
[55:06] at three I usually go at at bed like at
[55:09] 10 at 10 p.m. and and and stand up at
[55:12] like uh 6:00 a.m. but there are days
[55:14] where I stand up at 3:00 a.m because I
[55:16] can't sleep because I an idea that I
[55:18] want to discover now uh I never had that
[55:22] in my fat jop where I stood up at 3:00
[55:24] a.m. I'm like oh I have to do that work
[55:26] work now because I really want to in the
[55:29] feat chop is more like I have to stand
[55:31] up till 3:00 a.m. because I have to
[55:33] finish a project that that might be the
[55:36] case now it's like I I I I stand up in
[55:39] the middle of the night I'm like oh like
[55:42] that's a crazy good idea I have to
[55:43] pursue that usually it's not that great
[55:45] but like at 3 A.M it sounds really great
[55:47] it's just that creativity that that
[55:50] comes up and all of the sudden you you
[55:51] you can be in the creating sphere and in
[55:54] in the idea sphere in the collaboration
[55:57] sphere and and and and not in the oh
[56:00] yeah today is Tuesday and no those are
[56:02] my five tasks I will do my five tasks
[56:05] and okay I put a check mark and yeah my
[56:07] boss is happy I'm now going back and and
[56:09] eating it it's a whole different thing
[56:12] and I mean I kind of work in a similar
[56:16] style I work out in the in the morning I
[56:19] work dur the day and in the evening I
[56:20] take off and like the working hours did
[56:23] not change I still work like from like 8
[56:26] seven like it work actually more than
[56:28] did before but the the the thing that
[56:32] really changes the creativity the
[56:34] thriving and just after a year I can
[56:37] really uh see a difference there and the
[56:39] probably like 50 other small examples
[56:41] that I can bring but um that really
[56:45] gives the person the freedom uh of of of
[56:48] doing it I just don't know if everyone
[56:50] is ready for that I I don't like as as
[56:53] we said before a lot of people prefer
[56:56] working in a clear structure and doing
[56:59] that and they would be scared or they
[57:02] wouldn't I don't know like they might be
[57:04] not uh able to even do do that from from
[57:08] their own personal things I I I have a
[57:12] lot of doubts about about how we get
[57:15] there and how many people will will
[57:16] adopt that
[57:17] freedom yeah I mean you you would still
[57:20] have that option I mean you just you
[57:23] should be aware that there's another
[57:24] option like you said you know I been
[57:26] working much more since I quit my job I
[57:28] will never have a job but I'm always
[57:30] working and an interesting anecdote
[57:33] might be that humans are the only
[57:35] animals that engage in you know
[57:39] artificial cutting of sleep which is
[57:42] putting on the alarm to get to work and
[57:46] no other animal does this right why is
[57:48] that and just you wake up every day
[57:50] without a larm yeah most of the time
[57:52] unless I have a meeting or something
[57:54] that I really need to get into or I had
[57:56] a long night and for some reason I need
[57:58] to get up you know there's uses for that
[58:00] but you know I don't have like a 9 to5
[58:04] schedule
[58:05] anymore yeah I I do have my my
[58:09] girlfriend next to me but other than
[58:11] that maybe I would also not have an
[58:13] alarm uh but she is my alarm now yeah I
[58:17] mean it's worth to try like or if you
[58:19] have kids you know wake up when they
[58:22] wake up I mean it's it's a it's a
[58:24] natural way to start your day you know
[58:26] when it starts to get light your body
[58:29] knows already that it's it's time to get
[58:30] up it's just a matter of you know if you
[58:33] if you were pulled an all nighter then
[58:35] you're not going to be able to do that
[58:36] obviously but if you go to sleep at a
[58:38] reasonable hour well when you're tired
[58:40] that's your body's way to tell you that
[58:42] maybe it's time to go to sleep if you
[58:44] listen to your body you I don't think
[58:46] you need an alarm even even if you sort
[58:48] of have to wake up at 700 you go to
[58:51] sleep uh before midnight and then you
[58:53] will wake up at 700 absolutely
[58:56] especially if you open the curtains and
[58:57] the sun is coming in uh I think a lot of
[59:00] people um don't use the I I I really
[59:06] enjoy going up in the morning and going
[59:08] into the Sun as soon as the sun is here
[59:10] I usually now in the v actually stand up
[59:12] before the sun comes out but uh as soon
[59:15] it comes out I just like to be like in
[59:17] the sun either for a quick run or just
[59:19] like if if I don't have time at least
[59:21] like 10 minutes just walking around the
[59:23] block and and seeing the sun uh that
[59:26] really sets
[59:27] your uh how they called the internal
[59:31] rhythms uh of your cadium Rhythm uh
[59:35] that's that's really important and then
[59:37] you can also sleep better yeah yeah I
[59:41] found that too especially after moving
[59:42] to MOA where the sun is uh much more
[59:45] abundant than in in Finland where I'm
[59:48] from yeah you move from from up to the
[59:51] down yeah yeah uh really cool um we have
[59:56] one question that I ask each and every
[59:57] one of my guests and the question is
[59:59] what can we learn from you besides
[60:02] Bitcoin I think I I classify myself as a
[60:05] generalist I know a lot of things about
[60:08] a lot of things but I'm not really an
[60:10] expert of anything but I do have a Fiat
[60:14] profession in construction engineering
[60:16] so I guess you could learn about
[60:18] building buildings from me that's
[60:20] something that I still do on occasion to
[60:22] mine Fiat so that's what I actually have
[60:25] my formal degree for Sustainable
[60:27] Building
[60:28] Technology which I got it got from uh
[60:31] University of Nottingham in 2010 I
[60:34] believe so I know something about that
[60:37] but like I said it's not really it is
[60:40] something that I I chose from Pure
[60:42] practical sense because I figured I mean
[60:45] there's always going to be buildings
[60:46] there's always going to be work in
[60:48] construction which is true but it's not
[60:52] really something that I'm excited to to
[60:56] get up in the morning like you said and
[60:58] you know get a huge idea and can't wait
[61:01] to get to work it's more like something
[61:03] that I worked hard on to to learn and
[61:07] it's a useful skill to have but it's not
[61:09] my
[61:10] passion it's a it's probably also like
[61:13] um uh a good paid skill that that you
[61:17] still have and it's a profitable thing
[61:19] to do with the feed Minds yeah and this
[61:21] is also something that goes to the you
[61:23] know the prepar preparation and survival
[61:25] phase is like if you do have that backup
[61:28] you know if you do have that Fiat
[61:30] profession you can always fall back on
[61:31] that like that's that should at least
[61:33] alleviate your uneasiness about quitting
[61:37] your job because guess what if you're a
[61:39] professional in any field you'll find
[61:42] another job later if you decide that oh
[61:45] freedom is not for me I want slavery you
[61:47] can go back and be a slave and you can
[61:49] still be you know making good money out
[61:52] of that so you should not be afraid to
[61:54] try freedom I I I love that you always
[61:57] have the option to go back in slavery
[62:00] try out Freedom maybe it's not for you
[62:03] uh really cool we have end in the
[62:04] podcast where the previous guest as you
[62:06] know asked the next uh the the next
[62:09] guest a question without knowing who the
[62:11] next guest actually is and the previous
[62:13] guest asked you and I'm really
[62:14] interested in in in the in the answer
[62:16] for you because I think you used that a
[62:18] lot um what is the craziest AI use case
[62:23] you have seen so far that's really
[62:25] interesting
[62:26] the craziest AI use
[62:29] case I mean there's a lot of crazy
[62:32] things going on in AI for the past
[62:34] couple couple years um I mean I guess
[62:37] movies will be the next we're already
[62:39] seeing kind of crazy clips that are
[62:41] really really life like mean that's
[62:43] something also that sovereign individual
[62:44] predicted that you won't be able to tell
[62:47] what is true from the news anymore I
[62:49] think we're almost there that's pretty
[62:51] crazy when you think about it and the
[62:53] implications of that
[62:56] um I guess from professionally from
[63:00] publication I am kind of stunned and
[63:04] taking a back by how good AI translation
[63:07] is at the moment I did not expect it to
[63:09] be so crazy good so that is something
[63:12] that I'm actively uh working on
[63:14] currently and working on improving the
[63:16] the workflow that's going to make a huge
[63:19] difference in terms of making Vital
[63:22] Information available at a very quick
[63:25] Pace as well well to a lot of people
[63:27] most people don't know English in the
[63:29] world uh so that that is maybe that's I
[63:32] I'll pick that as my
[63:33] answer yeah I'm I'm actually looking
[63:36] forward to that um I currently working
[63:39] on making my podcast um up there for all
[63:46] the people with all languages and just
[63:50] AI dubbing it in every language and
[63:52] actually YouTube is working on that
[63:53] feature so I I try to to figure out if I
[63:57] I can do it or should do it because I
[63:58] think YouTube is actually working on
[63:59] that feature where you can just choose
[64:02] which language you want to hear and
[64:04] YouTube is on the back side of it
[64:07] translating and automatically so you can
[64:09] listen to that podcast in uh finish
[64:13] Finnish in in your language or in in in
[64:17] Spanish or in Spain or like whatever
[64:19] language you you have uh German and you
[64:21] can listen to it uh and it doesn't
[64:24] matter which language we are speaking
[64:26] because the AI not only does translation
[64:28] but they also do the voice of the the
[64:31] speaker and I'm that that's a that's a
[64:34] crazy thing of like having all of a
[64:37] sudden the library opened up and it does
[64:39] not matter if you're German English or
[64:42] whatever the whole world all of the
[64:43] sudden is your Marketplace uh in the
[64:46] internet that that's a that's a crazy
[64:48] one yeah yeah I greated absolutely thank
