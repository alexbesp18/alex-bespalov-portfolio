[00:00] if she hits the fan with a monetary
[00:02] system crumbling down if people already
[00:03] have uh something to lean on like
[00:06] Bitcoin there can be less pain they
[00:08] wanted to get Bitcoin when the war came
[00:09] in but they had like no way to get it
[00:11] they couldn't take their houses with
[00:12] them if you don't believe in uh
[00:14] everything the government is doing using
[00:16] their money is basically still being
[00:18] part of it you can do a transaction that
[00:20] you decide who you going to send money
[00:21] to and when how much nobody can stop it
[00:23] my goal is to to earn more Bitcoins in
[00:26] general like I I want to measure my
[00:28] wealth not in dollar terms but in
[00:29] Bitcoin terms these dictatorships will
[00:31] be defunded in the end how long till
[00:33] Bitcoin is the main unit of account 20
[00:36] to 30
[00:37] Years first question I think it's it's
[00:40] an interesting one because you're
[00:41] educating a lot of people about Bitcoin
[00:43] and it's also a question I ask myself a
[00:46] lot because I also do a lot of Bitcoin
[00:50] content and if Bitcoin is really that
[00:52] like that kind of sound money that we we
[00:55] think it is and it will come eventually
[00:58] anyways like why are we doing the
[01:01] education part like if we could just sit
[01:04] back and relax and and and just see how
[01:06] the adoption grows and we couldn't care
[01:09] less if Bitcoin is actually s
[01:11] money that's a very good question
[01:13] because I I asked it myself many many
[01:15] times and it's a it's a nice mental
[01:18] experiment I'm doing with myself it's
[01:19] like yeah if Bitcoin going to succeed
[01:21] like do we need Educators
[01:23] really um yesterday I had a conversation
[01:26] here in El Salvador uh with one guy
[01:28] about it and he sees Bitcoin as a not
[01:32] only like network of computers but
[01:33] network of people and you know it really
[01:36] depends on the users and people who who
[01:38] use it if uh if it's going to succeed as
[01:41] well um I believe the more education we
[01:44] do the faster the transition can be or
[01:48] the um the less dangerous or less
[01:51] painful the transition to bitcoin will
[01:54] be over time if she hits the fan with a
[01:57] uh monetary system crumbling down if
[02:00] people already have a something to lean
[02:02] on like Bitcoin uh there can be less
[02:06] pain and we see it in countries where
[02:08] something uh Critical Hits like for
[02:10] example in Ukraine when the war came in
[02:12] um you know I'm from Slovakia so there
[02:14] was a lot of ukrainians came to Slovakia
[02:17] through the border and I spoke with some
[02:20] of them and uh and they they wanted to
[02:23] get Bitcoin when the war came in but
[02:25] they had like no way to get it uh they
[02:28] got some cash out of the ATMs but then
[02:31] they got shut down or the cash was gone
[02:34] they couldn't take their houses with
[02:35] them so the price of Bitcoin were
[02:38] significantly increasing uh during that
[02:41] period And I believe if people would be
[02:44] well educated or had some Bitcoin as a
[02:46] savings it would be much easier for them
[02:48] to relocate and you know start a new
[02:50] live have something with them so I think
[02:53] this is like the the education is kind
[02:54] of a function of a Time the better we do
[02:57] that uh the better we communicate
[02:59] Bitcoin and we understand the problems
[03:01] and show the problems to people like
[03:03] guys get ready if uh if if something bad
[03:06] happens take it as a uh as a as a saving
[03:09] but also as an insurance policy I
[03:12] believe the transition would be easier
[03:15] and there will not be so much pain
[03:17] because there there could be I think
[03:19] Bitcoin will eventually win even if
[03:21] there wouldn't be Educators but that
[03:23] adoption I think will will be through
[03:26] pain and it's not the ideal way I think
[03:29] I think can do it better yeah I also
[03:32] think that because if you like for
[03:34] example if you educate your uncle your
[03:36] aunt your your your friends and you
[03:39] teach them how to proper self- custody
[03:41] how to have the right tools and how to
[03:44] have the right exchanges and how to set
[03:47] everything up in the right way you
[03:49] probably um free them of some pain they
[03:53] would go through if they didn't didn't
[03:55] have that uh education so I think
[03:57] educators are here to make the
[03:59] transition Smo so I think that's a
[04:01] that's a wonderful wonderful way to look
[04:03] at it how did you find your your way
[04:05] into Bitcoin and did you learn it
[04:07] through pain or did you did you had
[04:09] someone to help
[04:10] you uh luckily I I learned it through
[04:13] curiosity that's that's the other way
[04:16] around so you can either go through pain
[04:17] or through curiosity um so it was like
[04:20] first time I heard about Bitcoin was
[04:22] 2015 didn't care that much I was like
[04:25] okay that's a Pon schem that's an it's a
[04:27] multi level uh because it was uced
[04:29] to me by by a friend that was into this
[04:32] mlms so I didn't care for two years and
[04:35] then 2017 my friend my good friend who
[04:38] uh was doing web design in in WordPress
[04:42] uh we wanted to web for him for our
[04:43] company and he told me you know Doan
[04:46] right now I'm uh I'm not doing so many
[04:48] so many websites but I'm starting
[04:50] Bitcoin right now I'm like okay Peter so
[04:53] man tell me more because I I kept
[04:55] hearing that and I I don't believe it
[04:57] very much so but I believe you so try to
[04:59] explain to me and he was telling me not
[05:01] about the price going up but more about
[05:04] how Bitcoin can help in societies and
[05:06] communities where they don't have access
[05:08] to bank accounts where inflation is is
[05:11] crawling in and hyperinflation is is uh
[05:14] is around so that really fascinated me
[05:17] and that helped me to see the benefits
[05:19] of the technology at the time I was
[05:21] studying uh management and economics but
[05:24] I was studying mostly kesian economics
[05:26] because on the school we had no um
[05:29] education on Austrian economics and On
[05:31] free market principles so this got me
[05:34] intrigued and I started to study Bitcoin
[05:36] like I went down to Rabbit Hole that
[05:38] evening for like six seven hours
[05:42] straight and then at maybe like 3 3:00
[05:44] a.m. 4: a.m. I was like oh damn I would
[05:46] need to go to sleep right now and the
[05:49] next day I called my uh my colleagues in
[05:51] a company I'm telling them guys I'll not
[05:53] come to work for like two three days I
[05:55] want to study
[05:56] Bitcoin so that was it for me and uh and
[05:59] already at the time I was an educator uh
[06:01] I was teaching kids math English uh and
[06:05] physics so that was kind of my job as a
[06:09] um as a university student I was
[06:11] tutoring you know younger students older
[06:13] students as well so at the time I fell
[06:16] in love already with education and when
[06:18] you see that information clicks to a
[06:21] person and suddenly you know they see
[06:22] World differently when you see the
[06:25] confidence in kids going up when they
[06:27] understand mathematics and the parents
[06:29] seeing them differently and giving them
[06:31] more credit and respect to the kids that
[06:33] was for for me like amazing moments
[06:35] where I really fell in love with with
[06:37] teaching and education so when I got
[06:40] into Bitcoin and really uh fell in love
[06:43] with that and I just combined it with
[06:44] education and I I started teaching
[06:46] Bitcoin that was like six years ago what
[06:49] stood up up to you for for Bitcoin
[06:52] because I think everybody has a kind of
[06:54] a different reason what was special
[06:56] about Bitcoin for me it was like this
[06:59] store value part where it's like you can
[07:01] save your financial energy it's like a
[07:03] savings account in the in the cyber
[07:06] space uh and what what was special to
[07:08] you for for
[07:10] Bitcoin I think two things most
[07:12] importantly the the store of value as
[07:14] well uh having money that are outside of
[07:18] the system that you don't want to uh
[07:21] support so if you don't believe in uh
[07:24] everything the government is doing using
[07:26] their money is basically still being
[07:28] part of it and this element of like we
[07:31] can do it differently if you don't
[07:33] believe with everything they're doing
[07:35] that was one of very important part and
[07:37] also like the censorship resistance like
[07:38] suddenly you can do a transaction that
[07:41] you decide who you're going to send
[07:42] money to and when how much nobody can
[07:45] stop it so this kind of Freedom element
[07:48] uh because I was very um draw into
[07:52] everything related to freedom for some
[07:54] years um I actually I haven't been
[07:56] employed at all in my life I was always
[07:59] is you know trying to hustle you know
[08:01] buy some um buy some headphones from
[08:04] China and sell them in Slovakia and then
[08:07] we started a construction business when
[08:09] I was 20 so I was always like I want to
[08:11] do things my way I I want to kind of Be
[08:14] My Own Boss and this kind of Freedom
[08:15] element was all around uh in me so I
[08:18] think that also helped me to see the
[08:20] power of Bitcoin what are you hustling
[08:22] right
[08:23] now right now we are we are mining
[08:25] Bitcoin so I'm I'm already like
[08:28] full-time in Bitcoin ecosystem so uh as
[08:31] an M as our company we are uh mining in
[08:34] Paraguay we have around 1,000 machines
[08:37] there like 60% is our owns and the rest
[08:40] we are hosting for for clients and um
[08:44] and we do Bitcoin education So currently
[08:46] I'm in El Salvador and I did here for
[08:48] two days Bitcoin Educators Academy so it
[08:52] was an academy focused on teachers on
[08:54] how to teach Bitcoin better how to be a
[08:56] better listener communicator how to
[08:59] simplify difficult concepts of Bitcoin
[09:02] so uh this doesn't pay the bills of
[09:04] course it's more like a mission but
[09:07] maybe one day it will be uh it will
[09:09] sustain itself right now we are
[09:11] sustaining it with with the mining all
[09:13] right you are in a special place I think
[09:15] because you know Europe because of your
[09:18] history in in Slovakia uh and you also
[09:21] live in two countries with Honduras and
[09:23] El Salvador they are as I'm informed
[09:26] right next to each other uh so they are
[09:29] having an shared border and the one
[09:32] country with El Salvador had a has a
[09:35] president that pushed Bitcoin adoption
[09:38] quite aggressively uh in 2021 and
[09:41] Honduras as I understand it is is more
[09:45] like a Grassroots uh adoption and has no
[09:48] leaders that do it try to top down how
[09:51] do you see the different adoption going
[09:54] when you compare it with Europe and
[09:56] maybe also Honduras versus Salvador
[09:59] what what differences do you see in that
[10:01] option there oh it's it's very very
[10:04] different and uh Europe especially in
[10:06] general people don't feel the pain and
[10:09] don't feel the problem of of money of
[10:11] banks because we have Banks all around
[10:14] uh you have multiple bank accounts it's
[10:16] very easy for you to transfer money use
[10:18] a credit card debit card so all this
[10:21] kind of Legacy Financial system is well
[10:23] positioned in Slovakia or in European
[10:26] countries um so people are asking you
[10:28] know why Bitcoin they just see as a
[10:30] speculation as a money number go up
[10:33] technology uh they don't see Bitcoin as
[10:36] a something useful very much but then if
[10:39] you go to countries like in Central
[10:41] America or South America suddenly people
[10:43] are like understanding the solution that
[10:46] Bitcoin is is bringing because you know
[10:50] they some I met yesterday some Educators
[10:53] who are telling me you know there are
[10:54] people who cannot read uh like 20 25
[10:57] years old so they barely
[10:59] cannot can work with uh with mobile
[11:02] phones you know so for them it's like
[11:04] everything needs to be more simplified
[11:06] uh nobody opens bank accounts to them
[11:08] there's no banks around no debit credit
[11:10] cards uh yesterday I met a guy here also
[11:13] in Salvador he's like in his 60 67 never
[11:17] used the card in his life only cash so
[11:20] so suddenly you see like a different
[11:22] Society where Bitcoin can be viewed from
[11:24] a different angle as a technology that
[11:26] can really help it um and a comparison
[11:28] between between Honduras and Salvador
[11:30] it's very huge in Honduras sadly the
[11:33] current president or the current
[11:34] government are more left leaning more
[11:38] socialist so they don't see Bitcoin as
[11:40] something great for them although they
[11:43] see BU as a as a kind of a role model
[11:46] leader of how huge support uh he has but
[11:51] uh they barely give a credit to bitcoin
[11:54] and kind of um erasing um corruption and
[11:58] all of that because it's very corrupt so
[12:01] we do the Grassroots approach we do the
[12:05] bottomup education
[12:07] approach um and although and we we have
[12:09] a certain capacity so in General on the
[12:12] mainland Bitcoin adoption isn't that
[12:15] huge we are focusing on ratan where we
[12:18] have the academy where we live so ratan
[12:21] as an island we already on boarded like
[12:22] 60 businesses there into Bitcoin we help
[12:25] to educate them right now we are
[12:26] creating like a merchant Association
[12:29] for for Bitcoin Merchants so kind of
[12:31] pushing a lot there because it's
[12:34] geographically you know connected
[12:36] isolated like we can focus there um
[12:39] sadly on on on the mainland there are
[12:41] not so many
[12:42] bitcoiners and uh in Honduras in general
[12:45] like ethereum is kind of getting popular
[12:48] there are some people pushing the
[12:49] blockchain narrative um so you know I
[12:53] hope that bitcoiners will will come and
[12:55] you know balance it out but again again
[12:59] you know we would love to do much more
[13:01] but we have just a certain capacity what
[13:03] we can allocate and that's why we
[13:05] decided okay ratan because of the free
[13:07] private city of Prosper where Bitcoin is
[13:09] a legal tender and it's the first
[13:11] jurisdiction in the world from last year
[13:14] where you can do Bitcoin as a unit of
[13:15] account which is also very unique so so
[13:18] that's why we are there and and that's
[13:19] why we are focusing on ran mostly right
[13:22] now how did you actually came to uh
[13:25] Honduras and El Salvador from Slovakia
[13:28] what br drove you there in in that
[13:31] countries it wasn't Bitcoin at all uh it
[13:33] was really funny
[13:35] because my client our client that was
[13:37] mining with us Robert one day he was
[13:40] sending me pictures of you know his
[13:41] family on a beach there was like a
[13:43] beautiful turkeys W I'm like Robert like
[13:46] where are you and he told me man it's a
[13:49] paradise it's called ratan I was like
[13:51] where is it like is it Africa is it Asia
[13:54] is it you know no idea and then I
[13:56] Googled it out and it was like okay this
[13:59] is Honduras this is like this is
[14:00] Caribbean perfect but Honduras isn't it
[14:03] like a dangerous country so I Google it
[14:04] out it was like the most dangerous
[14:05] country in the world I'm like okay this
[14:07] seems weird so I asked Robert like
[14:10] Robert are you safe there he was like
[14:12] yeah it's perfect it's super safe you
[14:13] need to come and what he told me what
[14:15] really made me made me arrive to ratan
[14:17] was that he bought a land on ratan in a
[14:21] Czech Village I'm like where like the
[14:24] Czech Village there are Czechs the third
[14:26] largest community on the island are
[14:28] Czechs
[14:29] like oh my God you know I'm from
[14:31] Slovakia we used to be one nation before
[14:33] Czechoslovakia so I really wanted to see
[14:35] like what are the checks what the hell
[14:37] are they doing on ratan and how come
[14:40] that they came all the way to Honduras
[14:42] and build a village there so of course
[14:44] the checks are you know the largest beer
[14:46] drinkers in the world per capita so of
[14:49] course the story has to do something
[14:50] with beer so they set up a brewery on
[14:54] the island because there was some
[14:55] agreement between Honduras and Czech
[14:57] Republic so one guy took a chance he
[15:00] came to Honduras he set up the brewery
[15:02] on the island so for three years they
[15:04] were brewing the beer uh shipping it
[15:06] across Central America and then one a
[15:09] large brand of beer came to the island
[15:11] dumped them with prices so they need to
[15:13] close down but the checks stayed there
[15:15] and they were like okay you know we are
[15:17] good at building stuff so the first
[15:20] thing they built was a was a a replica
[15:23] of a black paril ship since ratan is one
[15:25] of the most famous pirate Islands you
[15:27] know they wanted to build a pirate ship
[15:29] so this guy the same guy who built a
[15:31] brewery buil a build a black perel
[15:34] pirate ship and he was taking people all
[15:36] around Caribbean so it was the largest
[15:39] pirate ship at that time uh roaming the
[15:42] roaming the Caribbean Sea then it got
[15:45] decommissioned I think somebody stole it
[15:47] and and destroyed it and they said okay
[15:50] what are we going to do again so we are
[15:52] good at building so let's build houses
[15:54] and they slowly started building houses
[15:55] so they built cze Village which is right
[15:58] now like 60 70 houses there there is a
[16:01] Czech hospoda it's Czech Pub where every
[16:04] Tuesday the founder of uh um of the
[16:07] village is playing guitar and singing
[16:09] Czech folk songs so it's a very very
[16:13] unique weird place and uh and I was like
[16:16] okay I need to see that so that was kind
[16:18] of what what brought us to to
[16:20] ratan and for 12 days we were just
[16:22] roaming the island enjoying the place
[16:24] and then only I found out about Prosper
[16:26] this private City and then the story
[16:29] goes like how we end how we started the
[16:30] academy afterwards that's an amazing
[16:33] story uh that you found uh Bitcoin there
[16:39] um and that you came there because of
[16:42] the checks and it's it's
[16:45] funny very unexpected I imagine there is
[16:48] also a lot more circular economy going
[16:51] on in in El Salvador and in in in
[16:54] Honduras even then in in Europe as you
[16:56] said it's basically like an luxury item
[17:00] people see it as a luxury item in in
[17:03] especially in Austria like I'm I'm based
[17:05] in Austria and I see a lot in Austria
[17:07] and people are like ah why do I need it
[17:09] and even like it's oh it's a luxury item
[17:11] if you have a lot of money then you can
[17:13] go into Bitcoin it's like something like
[17:16] that and I speak with bitcoiners from
[17:18] all over the world like I had some some
[17:20] Africans on I had from Australia from
[17:23] from uh like basically every part of the
[17:26] world I I try to get Bitcoin on the
[17:28] podcast because it's interesting how
[17:31] they see uh different things differently
[17:34] like cbdcs are had an African on and he
[17:37] said like I'm not worried about cbdcs
[17:40] like I'm I'm I'm happy if I get some
[17:44] some transactions going with Bitcoin
[17:46] anyways and yeah it's it's it's it's fun
[17:49] to see the whole differences how do you
[17:52] that there's one interesting question
[17:54] for me um do you see it's important to
[17:57] spend your Bitcoin in order to fire up
[17:59] the circular economy or is it like fine
[18:01] for Bitcoin to just hold la like and how
[18:04] do you see the difference between Europe
[18:05] and El Sal
[18:08] there
[18:09] so for example in Honduras we don't have
[18:12] a lot of circular economies basically we
[18:14] are the the only one on ratan uh as I
[18:17] said on the mainland there's not so many
[18:19] Salvador is different of course um there
[18:22] Bitcoin Berlin is is doing amazing job
[18:24] here in Elon Bitcoin Beach um so there's
[18:28] some pretty amazing places here and
[18:30] about the spending part that's that's a
[18:32] very good question because this is uh
[18:34] something I you can get asked very very
[18:37] often so I think it's kind of like the
[18:40] same with money so if if if somebody ask
[18:44] like do you think it's it's uh important
[18:45] to spend money or to save it and you're
[18:48] like well I need to spend money to
[18:50] survive because I need to buy stuff and
[18:54] if I will not be saving you can and
[18:56] something happens you know I don't have
[18:58] money
[18:58] so both things are very important uh
[19:02] when we are doing Bitcoin education and
[19:04] and when we explain Bitcoin well the
[19:08] question comes of okay if this is this
[19:10] is a great teag why should I spend it if
[19:13] I'm if I'm spending let's say three four
[19:15] five% to buy Bitcoin non kyc I don't
[19:18] know in ATM or peer-to-peer whatever
[19:20] like why should I pay with it so this
[19:23] question is very valid for the people
[19:25] who don't earn Bitcoin or they need to
[19:28] pay to get Bitcoin and they are on the
[19:30] beginning of their Journey inside of the
[19:32] rabbit hole and it's it's kind of
[19:36] irresponsible and and hypocritic in a
[19:38] sense to say them no no no you need to
[19:39] spend Bitcoin to support the econ the
[19:41] circular economy and they're like dude
[19:43] you know I want to protect my my
[19:45] purchasing so for them the the unit of
[19:48] the store of value is the most important
[19:50] part the ones who are spending Bitcoin
[19:54] are mostly people who can afford to
[19:56] spend Bitcoin because they can buy it
[19:58] and they don't care about couple of
[19:59] percent uh for a fee to really get to it
[20:03] or they are earning Bitcoin because for
[20:05] example for me the same I'm my salary is
[20:07] all in Bitcoin I basically I don't have
[20:09] any cash to buy Bitcoin with so for me
[20:12] to spend Bitcoin is very natural because
[20:14] I don't have any other way I would need
[20:16] to exchange it for cash and then spend
[20:18] the cash which is another hassle for me
[20:21] that for some people it's the vice versa
[20:22] you know they need to buy Bitcoin to
[20:23] spend Bitcoin why would they do it they
[20:25] can just spend cash immediately or or
[20:27] spend pay with a
[20:29] so to jump start the circular
[20:31] economy um initially people should be
[20:34] motivated to to spend Bitcoin how they
[20:37] should be motivated they they could earn
[20:39] Bitcoin first so if they're if they open
[20:42] to to to earning Bitcoin as a as a
[20:45] little shops suddenly they are getting
[20:47] some money and they need to like okay
[20:49] they need to change it to dollar to to
[20:51] to pay with it or they can spend it
[20:53] directly with Bitcoin which is easier
[20:54] for them so it takes some time but
[20:57] initially you need to have people who
[20:59] understand the value of Bitcoin and that
[21:00] they want
[21:01] to keep it and and and get it maybe they
[21:04] give discounts when somebody pays with
[21:06] Bitcoin so the first they need to be
[21:08] very clear and very understand the idea
[21:12] of store of value and the value of
[21:14] Bitcoin and then over
[21:16] time they will um naturally get into
[21:19] spending it but they shouldn't be
[21:20] forcing them because then it's like dude
[21:23] Bitcoin is great like why should I spend
[21:24] it so it takes some time and uh and this
[21:27] is I see it I'm super excited to
[21:30] announce that this podcast just got the
[21:33] first ever sponsor I just started the
[21:37] podcast out like three months ago and
[21:39] now we have 21 Bitcoin as a partner for
[21:43] this podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[21:47] from day one and they teach and preach
[21:50] self custody this is my goto exchange
[21:55] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[21:57] my Bitcoin coin from this is the easiest
[22:00] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[22:03] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[22:06] this podcast use code Robin and click
[22:10] the link in the description really
[22:11] interesting because you are basically
[22:13] living on a Bitcoin standard you're only
[22:14] earning Bitcoin so you're also only
[22:16] spending Bitcoin if you need them uh and
[22:20] but I imagine you before Bitcoin you had
[22:23] just uh some feared uh uh money how
[22:28] how is the changing like did you notice
[22:31] some changes in your mindset because
[22:33] when you have fear like it gets less
[22:35] over time and Bitcoin it's like you you
[22:37] think TW like I think really hard before
[22:40] I spend or sell any Bitcoin because I
[22:43] know when I do it it could shoot up twox
[22:47] tomorrow if something happens like if
[22:49] Apple comes out tomorrow and says oh we
[22:52] putting uh Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[22:54] it shoots up crazy like this there's no
[22:56] no question about it so you think twice
[22:59] before you spend Bitcoin I think how did
[23:01] you notice any changes in your like
[23:03] mindset and day-to-day life of
[23:05] spending it's definitely like a lower
[23:08] time preference so as well I'm I'm
[23:10] thinking about you know what to buy and
[23:13] how how to spend although many times you
[23:16] know I I don't want to like because I
[23:17] see a lot of Bitcoin owners that are
[23:18] like cutting down their lifestyle and
[23:20] cost like to a to extreme level of like
[23:23] you know this meme of if you have chairs
[23:25] you're not uh you don't have enough
[23:27] Bitcoin
[23:28] there is a certain level in my point of
[23:30] view where uh basically my goal is to to
[23:34] earn more Bitcoins in general like I I
[23:36] want to measure uh the my wealth not in
[23:39] dollar terms but in Bitcoin terms and if
[23:42] there is some investment or some
[23:43] purchase that helps me or makes it
[23:45] easier for me to earn more Bitcoins and
[23:47] have more Bitcoins in the end I'm I'm
[23:49] willing to do it it's like just like an
[23:50] investment in a business right you're
[23:52] not cutting cost you're not firing every
[23:54] employee because you know it's a spand
[23:56] because nobody will be do doing nothing
[23:58] there will nobody working in your
[24:00] company and your company dies so kind of
[24:02] the same the same way I look at expenses
[24:04] as well being much more careful of you
[24:06] know what to buy and if I really need
[24:08] this and and trying to figure out the
[24:10] the lifestyle and
[24:12] everything and uh so so that's that's
[24:15] one thing and also the the whole
[24:17] volatility thing of of everything
[24:19] Suddenly It's like something I don't
[24:21] care about that much you know just the
[24:22] price of Bitcoin I maybe see it once a
[24:24] week two times a week uh when there are
[24:26] some news you know I'm scrolling Twitter
[24:28] there is some news with like a green
[24:30] candle I'm like okay let me check the
[24:32] price of Bitcoin whoa It's like 5% up or
[24:35] the vice versa if there's some negative
[24:37] meme I check it oh 7% down right now
[24:39] after the uh after the ETF you know the
[24:41] price dropped I just figured out from
[24:44] Twitter somehow and then I checked so I
[24:47] don't care about the price anymore that
[24:49] much as it was in the beginning that
[24:51] where I was checking the the portfolio
[24:53] or like what's the pric is doing and I
[24:55] was nervous like should I sell right now
[24:56] should I wait a little bit longer and
[24:58] all of that so kind of like a a higher
[25:02] peace of mind a more kind of meditative
[25:05] State towards uh the world and towards
[25:08] the the change of of exchange rate and
[25:11] also you know just I try to over time
[25:15] implement the Bitcoin mindset in a sense
[25:17] that I don't want to measure Bitcoin in
[25:21] dollar terms I want to measure Dollar in
[25:23] Bitcoin terms and then you see the
[25:26] dollar is kind of every time can lower
[25:29] and lower in terms of sets because all
[25:31] this measurement thing you know when we
[25:33] are measuring weight when we're
[25:34] measuring length we are using units that
[25:37] are fixed you don't have a one meter
[25:40] rubber ruler that extends and and you
[25:43] know it's like a like a like a chewing
[25:45] gum goes up and down uh we have a very
[25:49] fixed length but suddenly we when we're
[25:51] measuring value we're using dollars and
[25:53] Fiat currencies which are changing all
[25:56] the time it's a super stupid measure
[25:57] unit the only thing why we using that
[25:59] because we are accustomed to use that we
[26:02] are we we can think in dollars if I tell
[26:04] you the beer is
[26:06] $7 You' be like damn that's that's very
[26:08] expensive beer right so that's the
[26:11] measurement un need we understand but we
[26:13] can over time learn to measure things in
[26:16] satosi uh it just takes time and
[26:19] practice and and really getting used to
[26:20] it so I think like this is important
[26:22] also for Humanity or Societies or
[26:25] economies getting to a Bitcoin standard
[26:28] is not about just everybody using
[26:31] Bitcoin it's more about the mindset
[26:33] behind and just accounting uh and seeing
[26:36] value in something that's fixed in
[26:39] Supply just like the meter just like the
[26:41] weight just like one kilogram and all of
[26:44] that the the mean with one Bitcoin is
[26:46] one Bitcoin is real like if if you don't
[26:48] use Bitcoin as like a unit of account
[26:51] you're using an fiat currency that's the
[26:54] based on a massive rate every year
[26:57] you're doing doing something wrong it's
[26:59] it's I like that that thinking and that
[27:01] mindset and it's I think it's hard for
[27:04] people that are still living on a Fiat
[27:06] standard I still live on a Fiat standard
[27:08] my salary is in Fiat I have to spend
[27:11] Fiat because if I spend my Bitcoin I
[27:13] have tax imp implications like it's a
[27:16] whole whole thing here in Austria and of
[27:19] course there are tools and ways to do it
[27:21] but it's it's it's a hustle and a hurdle
[27:23] um how does how does victory for Bitcoin
[27:27] look like like when you when we zoom out
[27:30] like maybe 20 years or 50 years out um
[27:34] how do we say oh Bitcoin was successful
[27:37] how do we measure that how does a
[27:40] success for Bitcoin in 20 years look
[27:42] like hard to say I don't think there's
[27:44] some measure um I I rather look into it
[27:47] from the personal level because success
[27:49] is different for everybody else and if
[27:53] some person feels that they are
[27:55] oppressed or they are using money that
[27:57] are debased and they are being messed
[28:00] around by the central banks by the
[28:02] government and suddenly they can use
[28:04] Bitcoin and live in a place where they
[28:07] have same like-minded people using
[28:09] Bitcoin and and they are kind of
[28:12] financing their lives with Bitcoin
[28:13] earning it and spending it that's for me
[28:15] a success for that person um does it
[28:18] need to succeed on like a super big
[28:21] level to be Bitcoin be successful I
[28:23] don't think so that much as well I mean
[28:25] Bitcoin is succeeding today for many
[28:28] many people even though it's not widely
[28:31] adopted what I think is that if you look
[28:35] into Technologies like internet or
[28:37] emails you know we we're not running our
[28:39] own mailing servers um is it success for
[28:42] emails that everybody's running their
[28:45] own mailing servers is it success for
[28:47] internet if everybody understand how
[28:49] packets are distributed and and rooted
[28:52] no um and and the same for Bitcoin I
[28:56] think sadly a lot of people will
[28:58] implement or will will use custodian
[29:02] Services um because it will be Mar much
[29:04] more
[29:05] convenient so I think we would need to
[29:09] look into Super distant future where
[29:12] people really change their habits and
[29:14] and mindsets but in general people you
[29:16] know like to be in the comfort zone they
[29:18] like to be like somebody taking care of
[29:21] their stuff and just educating people on
[29:24] being self- Sovereign I think that's
[29:27] even more important than Bitcoin being
[29:29] super adopted because then it will come
[29:31] naturally to them um and they will kind
[29:34] of protect themselves against the
[29:36] oppression much better with Bitcoin with
[29:38] um
[29:39] digital um self self-defense
[29:42] Technologies and and all of that so I
[29:44] don't have in my mind something like an
[29:46] image of when Bitcoin succeeds I mean I
[29:49] would like to travel to places where
[29:50] people understand the value of Bitcoin
[29:52] and use it and of course there will be
[29:54] places that will be opposite where there
[29:56] will be some oppression and and
[29:58] dictatorship where you know people will
[30:01] not allowed to do that I hope that
[30:05] citizens of these places will be will
[30:07] find a way to get out and get away and
[30:09] get to a place where they feel better
[30:11] treated and these dictatorships will be
[30:13] defunded in the end but that's kind of a
[30:16] very long game of um defunding the
[30:19] states and and States being more like
[30:21] service providers and seeing you as a
[30:23] customer rather than a a tool and or an
[30:26] asset to a state
[30:28] so so this is kind of the the images I
[30:31] have in my head of like what is the
[30:33] success of Bitcoin and uh yeah I I see
[30:37] it more from like the personal level of
[30:39] every individual
[30:40] and yeah that's that's how how I see
[30:43] that it's it's an interesting Journey
[30:44] like defund Bitcoin is an device to
[30:49] defund uh like
[30:51] toon um auor in states that are just
[30:55] controlling just too much
[30:58] uh and having a state that is basically
[31:00] a servant to the citizens I think as it
[31:03] should be as a because I think I'm from
[31:08] Austria and I have like in in the
[31:10] restaurants and in the guest business
[31:13] it's always the saying that the guest is
[31:15] the king and because the guest is the
[31:17] one that pays and who pays the state the
[31:20] citizens with either taxes or
[31:24] with uh with with their hidden tax with
[31:29] inflation so then basically the state
[31:32] should Serve the People Best what they
[31:35] want but it's kind of the opposite in
[31:37] the last years where it's like oh the
[31:40] state controls the people as the state
[31:43] thinks that people want
[31:45] it on some on on some them not even
[31:48] Democratic if you look at like Central
[31:51] Bankers that they they never voted on
[31:53] like I never voted for any any Central
[31:56] Bankers Maybe local politicians yes they
[31:58] are voted on they they are on on some
[32:02] local groups and you you can even call
[32:05] them they are some some kind of
[32:08] reachable uh but not the high UPS like
[32:11] there are some some rules to it and I
[32:14] think a lot about how Bitcoin can change
[32:16] the whole sphere with with the political
[32:19] stuff and defunding Wars defunding a lot
[32:22] of stuff that goes wrong right now and I
[32:25] think that's also like a long way out
[32:27] the timeline is hard to predict as you
[32:28] said like 50 years 100 years 200 years I
[32:31] don't know what it's it's a fight wor
[32:33] worth fighting um when when you look at
[32:37] the whole education scene for Bitcoin uh
[32:41] I think you when you fall in the first
[32:43] rabbit holes you're like having the the
[32:46] whole technical things and then the
[32:48] financial things and after a while you
[32:50] go go deeper with privacy no KC utex o
[32:55] management like how deep are you going
[32:58] with newas and what do you think about
[33:01] Advanced Bitcoin tools with coin join
[33:04] utex o management how important is those
[33:06] are
[33:08] those so so first of all okay how how do
[33:10] you bu go with the newbies um it really
[33:12] depends on the the Newbie level before
[33:17] he enters Bitcoin if he's more technical
[33:19] if he really wants to dive deep into the
[33:21] text or if it's more like a maybe a
[33:23] merchant that just wants to explore the
[33:25] way to receive Bitcoin and send
[33:27] so it's it's very individual like not
[33:30] there's no pre- coiner that's the same
[33:33] right there's everybody's different
[33:34] coming from different backgrounds so the
[33:36] value or or the the skill of an educator
[33:39] is to assess the skill set of this
[33:42] person because once you try to force
[33:44] somebody into immediately into self-
[33:47] custody lightning wallet well you can
[33:50] try to do it but what happens is that
[33:53] people going to receive for example with
[33:55] Phoenix they going to receive their
[33:56] first transaction let's say 20,000 sets
[33:59] as a merchant selling a coffee or
[34:01] whatever and suddenly a channel is open
[34:03] where they need where they spend or like
[34:05] 3,000 sets are gone for the channel
[34:08] opening which is like more than 10% of
[34:11] it and they're like looking at it like
[34:13] what the heck like the guy told me that
[34:15] lightning is very cheap and they were
[34:17] like okay this happened maybe it was a
[34:19] mistake another time somebody pays
[34:21] another 20,000 sets and since you have
[34:24] only one channel with a capacity that
[34:26] cannot pop another 20K you you open
[34:28] another channel the kind of Phoenix
[34:32] opens another channel for you and you
[34:33] pay another 3,000 sets and this way you
[34:36] can discourage person from using
[34:38] lightning because they'll be like what
[34:39] the I'm losing money on this so
[34:43] without the very proper explanation of
[34:45] of what is a channel and how it works
[34:47] and what are the limitations and and all
[34:49] of that going immediately into self-
[34:52] custody lightning wallets is I think
[34:54] it's doing worse then um then showing
[34:59] them first like just how the money moves
[35:02] so I never if I really encounter person
[35:05] that's that's very new in Technologies
[35:06] in general and they don't want to go
[35:07] very deep I always go with a
[35:10] non-custodial or with sorry with
[35:12] custodial wallets like blink wallet of
[35:15] Satoshi and then I I tell people you
[35:18] know the limitations of it how much
[35:19] money they should keep and so on when I
[35:21] see a person you know coming after uh
[35:24] asking for more and wanting to go deeper
[35:26] perfect I know that this is the right
[35:27] person to even Deep dive so I think this
[35:31] is the very very important element of
[35:33] Education to really assessing the
[35:35] ability of that person what's their
[35:38] journey and not forcing them to kind of
[35:41] climb a huge wall but rather this is the
[35:43] first stair then go to another step and
[35:46] so on and then after a couple of steps
[35:49] you're behind the wall and you jump
[35:51] through the wall and you're just like on
[35:53] the side of self- custody and non kyc
[35:56] approach and all of that so I try to
[35:59] really fragment it in terms of tools
[36:02] like coin joins or other tools
[36:05] definitely a big fan of them I'm I'm a
[36:07] super huge fan of more privacy onchain
[36:11] more tools that will kind of get us uh
[36:13] fungibility on chain and and so on so
[36:16] I'm definitely a big uh um big fan of of
[36:20] all of that but again in terms of
[36:22] Education I'm trying to be very careful
[36:25] of who's the person to educate it in uh
[36:29] the thing is if if you educate a person
[36:31] well in terms of what's the value of
[36:34] self- custody what's the value of non
[36:38] kyc and and and fungibility and privacy
[36:41] sometimes they do all the research all
[36:44] the study themselves when they feel for
[36:45] it when they feel that they have time
[36:48] they they have capacity or they come to
[36:50] ask you some some nuanced questions but
[36:54] again before going to this techs you
[36:57] first need to educate them on the
[36:59] importance of what the tech is bringing
[37:01] on the importance of what the the
[37:03] feature is about and when they get it
[37:06] well when you do the very good job of
[37:07] explaining that handling the objections
[37:09] they have around that topic suddenly all
[37:12] the hard work of sitting down and
[37:14] scrolling through what is a coin joint
[37:16] how it works and trying it out they can
[37:18] do themselves and uh your job is like to
[37:21] really show them the value of
[37:24] this yeah and know also a really big
[37:27] compon proponent of having the first
[37:30] interaction with Bitcoin as easy as it
[37:33] gets like don't make it comp more
[37:36] complex as it as it should be like
[37:39] people
[37:40] are people are really fast overwhelmed
[37:44] with new technology with uh things they
[37:47] they they want to do and keep it simple
[37:50] in the beginning and then they can go
[37:52] down the rabbit hole with all the tools
[37:54] and all all the things like make them
[37:57] aware of the limitations but don't over
[37:59] overdo it with all the uto managements
[38:03] and coin join and what what not so I'm
[38:06] I'm big fan of that um before we go to
[38:08] our end routine um I have one more
[38:11] question I always like to ask bitcoiners
[38:15] uh did you had an altcoin season for
[38:17] yourself did you or how did you avoid
[38:20] the whole altcoin
[38:22] sphere I didn't avoid it I was very deep
[38:25] into it not very but
[38:27] um and I will tell you why and and I
[38:29] used I used to joke that I uh I was a
[38:32] Litecoin maximalist for a while and and
[38:36] the thing like why why it was like that
[38:38] because we used to have a a crypto only
[38:41] cafeteria in
[38:42] 2017 um it was maybe you know since
[38:45] you're from Austria maybe you know
[38:46] parallel Poes in Prague very unique
[38:49] Place uh very historic place it was the
[38:52] first crypto only cafeteria in the world
[38:55] uh founded in 2014 so you can only pay
[38:58] with Bitcoin Litecoin Monero I think
[39:00] ethereum at the time as well uh and
[39:03] there's no there was no Fiat you
[39:04] couldn't pay with Fiat at the time so
[39:06] what we did we uh with the founders of
[39:08] the Czech parallel police we we founded
[39:11] the Slovak one as well with this on the
[39:14] same principles like we don't accept any
[39:16] fat uh and I remember when the price of
[39:19] Bitcoin was starting to go super crazily
[39:23] up in 2017 in like November December
[39:26] people coming to our place they couldn't
[39:28] buy they couldn't pay with Bitcoin or
[39:30] they they could but nobody would because
[39:32] you paid $3 in in a fee uh for a coffee
[39:37] that cost you $2 and and then we needed
[39:39] to wait even because it was a low uh low
[39:42] fee we needed to wait couple of hours
[39:44] and rely on the person not doing the
[39:46] double spin so at the time the lightning
[39:48] wasn't implemented yet so that's why I
[39:51] was like guys okay store Bitcoin it's a
[39:53] good savings technology but for money
[39:56] nope uh here is the Litecoin you buy it
[39:58] for much cheaper um uh the fees are
[40:01] cheaper you know it it's faster and all
[40:03] of that so I even I I used to wear a
[40:05] Litecoin sweater and I used to have like
[40:08] a lot of lot of litecoins at the time
[40:11] instead of Bitcoin and then one day my
[40:15] friend Martin came to me and said Duan
[40:17] there is this new scaling technology for
[40:18] Bitcoin called lightning Network I'm
[40:20] like okay Martin so show me how it works
[40:23] so she he showed me how it works and it
[40:26] was it was falling failing it wasn't
[40:28] working at all the node was kind of
[40:30] falling down I'm like Martin well I
[40:33] don't think it works I will stick with
[40:35] my light coin and then after a couple of
[40:37] months again he came like Tuan it's
[40:39] finally working like let me show you he
[40:41] showed me BTC pay server you know and
[40:44] all of that I'm like damn like this is
[40:47] pretty amazing like super low fees
[40:50] immediate
[40:51] settlement and I was like damn this is
[40:54] crazy so at that time I understood the
[40:57] the days of liteco Litecoin are numbered
[41:00] because basically that was the only
[41:01] purpose that I had Litecoin for and that
[41:03] it worked for easy fast payments cheap
[41:06] ones so that day I sold all my Litecoin
[41:10] bought Bitcoin and I never got back
[41:13] again I like and I used to have I used
[41:17] to have also other coins in 2017 and I
[41:19] used to see like oh there needs to be
[41:21] this better Bitcoin um and it requires
[41:24] hours and hundreds of hours of Education
[41:26] of understanding why money converges to
[41:29] one why it doesn't make sense to have so
[41:32] so many monies and so it's I don't think
[41:36] it it's possible to do it like on the
[41:38] first try and this is where I'm kind of
[41:41] not a big fan of uh this toxicity in
[41:44] Bitcoin when somebody touched as a
[41:46] newbie or touches some altcoins and just
[41:50] slapping them on a face of like oh
[41:51] you're coiner we don't talk
[41:53] to you I'm like there are like two types
[41:56] of coiners the one is that he's new
[41:58] to the ecosystem he don't know what the
[42:01] money is he just wants to probably you
[42:03] know get rich in a sense try to touch
[42:06] the things and and figure out what it
[42:07] what it what what's this all about uh he
[42:10] has no idea what he's doing and uh and
[42:13] that person I believe we would we need
[42:16] to treat well and show them like why
[42:19] what I do I always show them why I have
[42:21] only Bitcoin I'm not pushing them like
[42:23] I'm not going to talk to you or you need
[42:25] to need to do this I'm showing them like
[42:26] look after these years I stuck only with
[42:30] Bitcoin and this is why I and I explain
[42:32] all the all the things behind that and
[42:35] if you meet a coiner on the on the
[42:37] different Spectrum where he knows
[42:40] everything and he knows why he
[42:42] coining like uh Richard Hart from hex
[42:45] for example uh they really are doing it
[42:47] for them to get rich on the on the
[42:50] expense of everybody else and this I
[42:53] would never like to talk to and uh there
[42:55] no point in in speaking with them and
[42:57] just explaining them something because
[42:58] they know why I why they are doing that
[43:00] so I'm trying to be humble in this sense
[43:03] and trying to figure out what type of
[43:05]  coiner I'm uh I'm engaging with
[43:08] because I was on the journey myself I
[43:10] wasn't Bitcoin only from the beginning
[43:13] and it's I think it's even Poss it's
[43:14] even impossible because all the
[43:16] technologies that we encounter like the
[43:19] Googles the the internet and the social
[43:21] media like the first one was really
[43:25] rarely the best one and there was like
[43:28] so much Evolution and Innovation uh
[43:31] happening afterwards so for us it seems
[43:33] very natural that the first one will not
[43:35] be the best one and there needs to be
[43:37] somebody better afterwards and it takes
[43:39] hours of Education to really get into it
[43:41] like oh my God so there are things in
[43:43] Bitcoin that you cannot copy with a code
[43:46] like the social layer like the network
[43:48] effect like just living under the radar
[43:50] for many years um and there like a bunch
[43:53] of other stuff so just understanding
[43:55] that it's it takes so much time that I'm
[43:58] I'm trying to be humble with with
[44:00] newbies not to kind of slap them on the
[44:02] face like you freaking
[44:04] coiner yeah it's it's it's important to
[44:06] be uh not too toxic especially with with
[44:10] people that are new to the space and uh
[44:13] not uh they're not trying to scam
[44:15] anybody as you said in the example there
[44:17] are coers that are actually trying
[44:19] to just get rich of it and scam other
[44:21] people from the money and there are some
[44:23] people that just did not do um all the
[44:27] research but they are in Bitcoin and
[44:29] they did the first step so it's really
[44:32] it's it shows that you're really
[44:33] open-minded and that you also that your
[44:35] journey is impressive if you people
[44:38] approach you hey look at the Bitcoin and
[44:40] you dismiss it but you you're open to it
[44:42] and I like your like your journey a lot
[44:45] um for the end routine we have uh always
[44:50] a question that the previous guest asks
[44:52] the next guest without knowing who's the
[44:54] next guest is and we kind of we we kind
[44:57] of touched the the the question a little
[45:00] bit and the question for you is how long
[45:02] till Bitcoin is the main unit of account
[45:06] wow like in the world right unit of
[45:11] account I would
[45:14] say 20 to 30
[45:17] years hopefully
[45:19] sooner that's that's an uh it's a nice
[45:23] timeline I would I would love that I
[45:26] still want to be alive my goal is to
[45:28] live till 2140 to see the last Bitcoin
[45:31] being mine so I need to I need to I'll
[45:34] try hard to to do that how old would you
[45:37] be by then oh like in 30 years I'm 30
[45:40] right now so I G to be 60 so I'm I hope
[45:43] if I don't mess up something I I would
[45:46] still be around in 30 years yeah but in
[45:49] 2140 then it oh in 240 uh I will be 149
[45:56] uh it's almost 150 years I wish you all
[45:59] the best with that I hope I make we I
[46:02] hope we make it we GNA we're gonna have
[46:04] a podcast on the on the day of uh mining
[46:08] the last Bitcoin I mean that that would
[46:09] be so sick having a live podcast when
[46:13] when the last Bitcoin is min with the
[46:15] block time running out like it's see
[46:17] seeing it live but let's see I hope
[46:20] medicine makes a a huge huge huge step
[46:23] so I can also do it like I'm now 25 so
[46:27] let's see um where can people find you
[46:31] the best where can people get in touch
[46:33] with you so the best way to to find me
[46:36] is on Twitter so Ducan D us anore matusa
[46:41] m a t ska that's my name and surname um
[46:45] they can follow our journey of MTH
[46:48] Academy or me as our company um also at
[46:52] Twitter at Amit y AG G why meth because
[46:57] uh we don't want to go to the story it's
[46:59] almost and but if you want we can we can
[47:01] uh we can talk about that yeah yeah talk
[47:03] about it like it's it's okay like we we
[47:05] I have time you said before that your
[47:08] laptop is running out of battery so like
[47:10] as long your batter is running we we can
[47:12] talk okay it's 28% still so since I put
[47:16] the
[47:17] um the the the screen kind of also I
[47:20] turn it off uh the battery is like super
[47:23] holding so that's that's pretty cool
[47:27] okay so we can go into that right yeah
[47:29] yeah okay so um so yeah people can find
[47:32] us on M and why M um because it's kind
[47:35] of weird name doesn't resemble anything
[47:36] with Bitcoin and that was on purpose so
[47:40] uh when we were sitting together with
[47:41] Gabriel my co-founder like about three
[47:43] years ago and chatting about about
[47:45] Bitcoin what Bitcoin really uh really is
[47:47] about we came to conclusions like okay
[47:50] what it means to us you know Freedom as
[47:52] well that that was the word but we went
[47:54] deeper on like what the Freedom actually
[47:57] means like how how does the world look
[47:59] like when we have freedom around us and
[48:02] we were speaking about the world where
[48:04] there is much better or much higher
[48:06] level of uh Harmony peace friendship and
[48:10] fellowship and cooperation if we have
[48:12] one sound money people can cooperate
[48:14] much easier and better on the global
[48:16] scale governments cannot print money to
[48:18] finance stupid Wars so I believe there
[48:21] is more Harmony and peace and there is
[48:24] this word in English
[48:26] that says emity which is very archaic
[48:29] word not used very much today and emity
[48:32] translates into Fellowship friendship
[48:34] and cooperation so we see Bitcoin as a
[48:37] technology that can get us that can
[48:40] bring us to the age of cooporation to
[48:43] the age of emity so that's why we could
[48:46] we put these words together and we made
[48:49] a company meth with a mission to educate
[48:53] or to bring welcome 100 million people
[48:56] in the Bitcoin rabbit hole that's our
[48:58] kind of Big Goal we want to welcome as
[49:01] many people in the rabbit hole as there
[49:02] are Satoshi in one
[49:04] Bitcoin and then also if you if you open
[49:06] the website or if you if you go to a
[49:09] Twitter and put me like you see this our
[49:12] logo like a little face of a girl so
[49:15] that's emit tin Nakamoto the
[49:17] granddaughter of Satoshi and since toosi
[49:20] left and he's not around anymore there
[49:22] needs to be somebody you know uh pushing
[49:25] the the education of of Bitcoin forward
[49:27] so we created this character his
[49:29] granddaughter this is the young blood
[49:31] you know taking the legacy of Satoshi
[49:33] and spreading in around the world so
[49:35] that's kind of the Avatar we created to
[49:37] help people uh be on this educational
[49:40] Journey yeah I definitely have to to
[49:43] check this out more like I like the
[49:45] character graded from the granddaughter
[49:47] of the Sosi Nakamoto and 100 million is
[49:51] it's a a cool goal like I think 100
[49:54] million is a like a really really big
[49:56] number but uh a lot of people will come
[49:58] into Bitcoin so it's it's definitely
[50:00] possible I wish you all the best on the
[50:02] journey thank you very much Robin yeah
[50:05] thank you for being on
[50:10] [Music]
[50:13] thanks
