[00:00] You know, my life revolves around two
[00:02] poles, the family and and Bitcoin. You
[00:04] know, I had retired already and uh I
[00:07] wanted to stay retired uh retired with
[00:09] Bitcoin, but if it was only choosing
[00:11] between Bitcoin and cash, it would be,
[00:13] you know, 70 75% Bitcoin. You know, be
[00:16] stoic, be chill, because the more chill
[00:18] you are, the more Bitcoin you should
[00:20] hold as a percentage of your liquid
[00:23] capital or wealth. And I need something
[00:25] that's going to perform. giving it to
[00:27] Wall Street is give them the money and
[00:30] they'll make sure that they have the
[00:31] yachts and volatility coming down is is
[00:34] also a good thing because it makes it
[00:36] more acceptable to this, you know,
[00:38] broader community, right? So, by 2033,
[00:41] we can project that Bitcoin may surpass
[00:45] uh the market cap of of gold.
[00:49] [Music]
[00:52] Hi, Stephen. How are you doing?
[00:53] Everything fine on your end? Yeah,
[00:55] great. Uh good to be with you again,
[00:57] Robin. Looking forward to it. Was really
[01:00] cool last time and thought let's do it
[01:02] again. Uh you uh you prepared a a new
[01:05] deck of of slides that is really
[01:07] interesting and just as a small spoiler
[01:09] alert, I saw the I think last second to
[01:12] last uh slide or something like that
[01:14] with the quote of Warren Buffett and I
[01:16] love that quote so much. I always bring
[01:18] it up with people when people tell me,
[01:20] "Oh, you're over overly allocated to to
[01:23] Bitcoin." Um but let's get into um what
[01:26] what has kind of happened for you uh in
[01:29] and bitcoin over the last I think around
[01:32] one year that we have last recorded uh
[01:35] with the strategic bitcoin reserve with
[01:37] I think bitcoin hit the 100k between uh
[01:40] the last recording uh what was kind of
[01:43] noteworthy for you in that period of
[01:45] time. Well, I think we had obviously we
[01:48] had a runup around the election in the
[01:50] US and you know that pushed us up to to
[01:54] 108k and then later we hit 109k when it
[01:58] retested and uh the you know the
[02:02] liquidity was supportive at that time
[02:04] and obviously the narrative was very
[02:06] supportive and people became over
[02:08] anxious I think about the bitcoin
[02:10] strategic reserve which is going to
[02:12] happen but I think requires some
[02:15] legislation in congress. to be fully
[02:17] implemented and I think the chances of
[02:19] that going forward are good. We've got
[02:21] the initial allocation of the 200,000
[02:24] that you know comes from seized Bitcoin.
[02:27] The liquidity situation was not fully
[02:31] cooperative. the liquidity had fallen,
[02:34] global liquidity uh had fallen in in Q4
[02:38] and there tends to be about a one
[02:39] quarter lag, something like 11 to 13
[02:42] weeks if you follow the you know what
[02:44] other people say and so that you know
[02:48] was reflective in how prices behaved in
[02:50] Q1 as well as the narrative coming off I
[02:53] think but now we've seen a pickup in
[02:55] global liquidity again and we're
[02:58] starting to see a bit pick up in Bitcoin
[03:00] prices uh Gold tends to lead Bitcoin and
[03:04] gold is performing very well with all of
[03:07] the
[03:08] uncertainty around the the discussion
[03:10] around tariffs and you know even talk of
[03:13] of monetary crisis and you know what's
[03:17] happening with yield spreads and so
[03:20] forth. Um so there's a lot of
[03:22] uncertainty and safe havens you know
[03:26] respond to that and gold has responded
[03:28] and we're seeing Bitcoin start to
[03:29] respond. it tends to lag gold by, you
[03:33] know, a similar kind of one quarter.
[03:35] I'll talk about some of these lags in in
[03:37] the presentation today. Really cool.
[03:40] Yeah, have a ton of ton of questions
[03:43] around that. Maybe I'll I'll save them
[03:44] for later because it's super interesting
[03:47] how Bitcoin just follows liquidity. I
[03:49] mean, it also makes sense more money uh
[03:51] drives up demand. Um but yeah, let's
[03:54] let's get started with with with with
[03:56] the presentation and let's get started
[03:57] with with the things uh you have
[03:59] prepared for. Okay, let me uh share
[04:02] that. Okay, I've I've titled this the
[04:04] power laws of Bitcoin. I think it's the
[04:05] same title I used when we uh recorded
[04:08] last time last year, but the subtitle is
[04:11] different. It's power and persistence.
[04:14] So I want to show some you know new
[04:16] research that I've done in the interim
[04:19] uh in particular around something called
[04:22] the Hurst exponent that's spelled hur
[04:25] rst and that is a way to measure the
[04:28] persistence of price behavior. Uh the
[04:30] overall agenda is first a kind of a
[04:32] quick reminder about power laws and in
[04:35] particular about the power law that
[04:38] Bitcoin follows that Bitcoin prices
[04:40] follow with respect to both the dollar
[04:42] and to
[04:43] gold and then I will mention uh some
[04:46] survey research around the efficient
[04:49] market
[04:50] hypothesis and out of 25 different
[04:53] papers you know the vast majority have
[04:57] demonstrated that Bitcoin prices do not
[05:00] adhere to efficient market as in
[05:02] reversion to mean or you know Gaussian
[05:05] and log normal behavior that's like a
[05:07] random walk and then I'll get into
[05:10] really the core of the presentation
[05:12] around the Hurst exponent
[05:14] analysis and how that demonstrates the
[05:17] persistence of power law behavior and
[05:20] also I'll talk about the distinction
[05:22] between the core power law and the
[05:25] bubble behavior that sits on top of this
[05:29] power law core. The bubbles rise and
[05:31] then fall, you know, back to the power
[05:33] law. Also, I'll point out that bubbles
[05:36] have getting smaller over the long term.
[05:38] And so, I'll I'll show evidence for
[05:40] that. If we have time at the end, I'll
[05:42] talk about the Kelly criterion for
[05:44] portfolio sizing. And, you know, how
[05:47] much could you imagine allocating in
[05:50] your portfolio to Bitcoin? Okay. Uh,
[05:52] power laws are ubiquitous in the
[05:54] universe. And this I just saw this uh
[05:58] earlier this week or in the past week.
[06:01] This is kind of a graph of everything.
[06:04] It's it's got everything you could
[06:05] imagine on it from fundamental particles
[06:08] down in the lower left to you know atoms
[06:11] up through bacteria, viruses, fleas,
[06:14] humans, whales all the way up to the
[06:16] sun, red giant stars,
[06:18] uh that you can see in sort of that
[06:20] middle pink
[06:21] area. And then the blue area has u kind
[06:25] of the least dense structures in the
[06:28] universe which are our galaxies and our
[06:32] galaxy clusters and superclusters in the
[06:34] upper right all the way up to the Hubble
[06:37] radius which is the scale of our
[06:40] observable universe.
[06:42] We've got this big line called black
[06:44] holes. Kind of on the middle left,
[06:46] you'll see black holes. And that's a has
[06:48] a different slope to it than the
[06:50] others, which is interesting. But this
[06:53] whole thing is a a vast
[06:55] landscape that's a kind of a Google by a
[06:58] Google. There's over a Google, which is
[07:00] 10 the 100th, you know, 100 factors of
[07:02] 10 dynamic range on the y ais and very
[07:06] nearly a Google on the x-axis. So that
[07:08] the y-axis has
[07:10] mass but in logarithmic terms and the
[07:14] x-axis has the radius. Uh at the bottom
[07:18] it shows it in centimeters and the top
[07:21] it shows it in mega parex that
[07:23] astronomers like but in either case
[07:25] we're talking close to 100 orders of
[07:28] magnitude. So it it's very
[07:30] all-encompassing. But the important
[07:32] thing here is that this is a log log
[07:34] chart. So anything that's a straight
[07:36] line is a power law relationship. So if
[07:39] you go the size of things from atoms all
[07:42] the way up through the sun, it sort of
[07:45] fits in that band,
[07:47] right, of a power law. And
[07:51] it's, you know, that if you have a
[07:53] constant density
[07:55] uh mass times density time the radius
[07:59] cubed, right?
[08:01] It turns out that the average density of
[08:04] the sun is not different from your
[08:06] average density. It's within 40%. The
[08:08] average density of a human is what? Is
[08:10] water. It's a gram per cc. For the sun,
[08:15] it's only 40% higher. It's 1.4 g per cc.
[08:19] Much denser than the core, but on
[08:20] average it's it's similar. So those
[08:22] things all line up. And then you see the
[08:24] black holes. They all line up with a
[08:26] different power law, a very different
[08:28] slope. And the reason is that under
[08:31] general relativity, the radius of a
[08:33] black hole is proportional to its mass.
[08:35] So there's not this mass going is the
[08:38] cube of the the radius kind of
[08:40] relationship. It's directly
[08:42] proportional. So those are two extreme
[08:44] examples. Then that blue band is kind of
[08:47] the lowest density stuff which is
[08:51] galaxies and clusters and galaxy
[08:52] clusters in the universe as a whole. And
[08:55] that does follow also the R cube kind of
[08:57] thing. And we have this critical density
[09:00] that matches that. So that blue band or
[09:02] sort of purplish is called omega m in
[09:05] the legend. M being for
[09:08] matter. And everything else is would be
[09:11] dominated by radiation density. That's
[09:13] all the pink. And then you have these
[09:15] forbidden zones forbidden by gravity and
[09:18] forbidden by limits of the quantum
[09:20] certainty. But it's just to show how
[09:22] ubiquitous you know power laws are in
[09:25] nature. And it turns out of the four
[09:28] fundamental forces of gravity,
[09:30] electromagnetics, and the two nuclear
[09:32] forces, they're all either pure power
[09:34] laws or they have power laws as
[09:37] components of the the overall laws. Then
[09:39] I like this uh quote from Buckminister
[09:44] Fuller who in
[09:46] 1967 you know 58 years ago he said by
[09:49] the year 2000 there will be a realistic
[09:52] scientific accounting system.
[09:54] Wealth is not gold, it's energy. And
[09:57] wealth always increases. And I I tweeted
[10:00] this out and I said that we have in
[10:02] Bitcoin the first completely scientific
[10:04] standard ledger, the first direct from
[10:08] energy monetary system for enumerating
[10:10] wealth. It appeared 42 years
[10:13] after Buckminister Fuller's preion
[10:17] statement. So the underlying the power
[10:20] law for Bitcoin is the proofof work
[10:22] implementation. And so we we take energy
[10:24] which is power times time. We've got a
[10:28] continuous 19 or 20 gawatt that's
[10:31] feeding the millions of ASIC computers
[10:34] and they're
[10:35] collectively cooperating and competing
[10:38] to produce 800 to a,000 exahashes per
[10:41] second. This leads us to high
[10:44] security and that provides the
[10:47] foundation
[10:48] for the power law behavior of Bitcoin
[10:51] price. This is a basic thesis that
[10:54] Giovani Santos Stasis first enumerated
[10:57] in
[10:58] 2014 that uh the value goes is
[11:03] the square of the adoption. This comes
[11:05] from Metcast law which is the behavior
[11:07] of networks. We see this in the
[11:10] internet. We see this in social networks
[11:12] that roughly the value goes as a square
[11:15] of the adoption or the size of the user
[11:17] community. And for Bitcoin, the adoption
[11:20] has grown as roughly the third power of
[11:22] time. So when you combine the square of
[11:25] the adoption with the third power of
[11:27] time, you get price going is nearly the
[11:30] sixth power of time. A really steep
[11:32] parallel. Now you can show this in two
[11:35] minutes. And I did this today
[11:37] actually. Somebody tweeted out and it's
[11:40] in the left hand. They tweeted out uh
[11:43] all the prices on Easter. So in 2020 at
[11:46] Easter it was
[11:48] $5. This year it was $84,000 on Easter
[11:52] day. Now Easter moves around, you know,
[11:54] a couple of weeks, but roughly, you
[11:56] know, these are your a year
[11:58] apart. I asked Chad GPT, take those
[12:02] four and then take the age using mid
[12:05] April for these years and the zero point
[12:09] has to be when Bitcoin started, which of
[12:12] course is January 2009.
[12:14] and do a parallel regression and it came
[12:17] up with basically the right answer when
[12:19] we throw a lot more data and do the
[12:22] analysis. It found that the price goes
[12:25] as the age of the 5.7 power nearly the
[12:29] sixth power with a very high R squared
[12:32] of 0.94. It and there's the graph. It
[12:34] shows
[12:35] it. It's only 14 data
[12:38] points. This is a log log chart. And so
[12:42] you've got the log of the price, you
[12:44] know, varying from less than $10 to
[12:46] nearly $100,000 over the interval. And
[12:50] the age is also a logarithmic chart. You
[12:52] can see the lines are getting closer
[12:53] together as you go from four to six up
[12:56] to 10 uh years. And it's really quite a
[12:59] nice fit with a small amount of data
[13:01] because the power law is persistent.
[13:03] It's
[13:04] strong. You can do this at home in a few
[13:07] minutes. Take just pick any
[13:10] date. Look up the Bitcoin price on that
[13:13] random date, same date every year. Try
[13:16] it yourself. Now, this is a much more
[13:18] detailed analysis.
[13:20] This is using weekly
[13:22] prices and it starts in the middle of
[13:25] 2010 and you know runs up to
[13:29] date and this also looks at auto
[13:32] reggression. People have sometimes said
[13:34] well you know there's auto reggression
[13:35] in Bitcoin. This one has been corrected
[13:38] for second level autogra autocorrelation
[13:43] uh which is one week and two week
[13:45] autocorrelation because these are weekly
[13:47] data
[13:48] points and once you do that your Durban
[13:51] Watson statistic which is the statistic
[13:53] that tests for
[13:55] autocorrelation is very close to two
[13:57] which is what you want it to do to
[13:59] eliminate the effect of
[14:02] autocorrelation. And then this is being
[14:05] quantile regression. We've run for a
[14:08] number of different levels from the 0.05
[14:11] quantile all the way up to the
[14:13] 0.95. The median is the red line is the
[14:16] 0.5. And then the equations for each of
[14:19] these are
[14:20] shown. And what you find is that below
[14:22] the median you see a power law that's
[14:25] got an index between 5.8 and 5.9.
[14:29] above the median, it's a somewhat less
[14:32] steep parallel between five and
[14:35] 5.4. So here you're already seeing hints
[14:38] of the difference between the core and
[14:40] the bubble. Out of the seven
[14:43] regressions, four of them are quite
[14:45] bunched up. The red line is the median
[14:47] and then there are three below. In fact,
[14:50] two of them are right on top of each
[14:51] other. So you can hardly discriminate
[14:53] the orange and the blue, but they're
[14:54] kind of all crunched up and you can see
[14:56] that they act as the support line.
[14:59] uh where Bitcoin after the bubbles comes
[15:02] back to that support line and and finds
[15:04] a pretty firm foundation that continues
[15:06] all the way up. So that's the true core
[15:10] power law and we've done more detailed
[15:13] statistical analysis to show the
[15:15] distinction between the two. But the
[15:18] other hint you're getting is that the
[15:20] bubbles are becoming smaller relatively
[15:23] because these lines are kind of sloping
[15:25] downward converging.
[15:27] They're less steep parallel, you know, 5
[15:29] to
[15:30] 5.4 rather than the core 5.8 to 5.9.
[15:34] Now, that was the dollar. This is for
[15:35] gold. We see the same thing for gold.
[15:38] That was a log log plot. Uh this is the
[15:41] kind of plot you see more often, which
[15:43] is a log linear plot. So, here we
[15:45] have the log of the price, but measured
[15:49] in gold ounces. And so, it's from less
[15:52] than 1,000th of an ounce up to over 10
[15:55] ounces. Now it's close to 30. It's in
[15:58] the high
[15:59] 20s. And the age of Bitcoin ranging from
[16:02] 2 years to almost 16 years. And the
[16:05] green curve is a parallel fit. Uh this
[16:08] one has an index of
[16:10] 5.4. Uh more detailed analysis with with
[16:13] more data will show you 5.5, but
[16:16] basically that's where you get your
[16:17] around 5 a half. It also has a high R
[16:21] squared. Gold is doing a little bit
[16:23] better than the dollar. And that's why
[16:25] the the power law is a little bit less
[16:28] steep, but it's very strong relative
[16:31] performance. If time increases by a
[16:33] factor of two, Bitcoin measured in gold
[16:36] ounces increases by a factor of
[16:39] 42. And the projection is that you would
[16:42] reach something like 400 ounces, which
[16:44] is called a good delivery bar in the in
[16:46] the world of, you know, gold bars
[16:48] stacked up by central banks and and
[16:51] government treasuries. and uh you know
[16:55] uh very large hedge funds you would
[16:59] reach that level by 2033 and that would
[17:02] correspond
[17:03] to the equivalent of 8 billion ounces of
[17:07] gold which exceeds all the gold on earth
[17:09] which is about 6 billion ounces. So by
[17:12] 2033 we can project that bitcoin may
[17:15] surpass uh the market cap of of gold
[17:19] which is not that far away. Super
[17:21] interesting. Also, yeah, I I love also
[17:26] you you call it bubbles. Um I I usually
[17:29] call it volatility uh of of the price. I
[17:32] think that's what you mean the the the
[17:34] upbursts of of a price that we had like
[17:37] 2017 the the 2021
[17:40] uh and with that going down over time
[17:42] and it's clearly is showing over the
[17:44] last 16 years that those bubbles are
[17:47] going down. also the yearly growth rate
[17:50] of of Bitcoin with with that is coming
[17:52] down right uh to first order the yearly
[17:55] growth rate is equal to the power law
[17:57] index over the age now there's a
[17:58] compounding and there are second order
[18:00] terms in the expansion but uh so right
[18:03] now it's about 42% is the trend for the
[18:06] power law and it comes down you know a
[18:10] couple of percent
[18:12] uh each year in other words as the age
[18:17] doubles from here instead of being 42%
[18:20] it might be 20
[18:22] 21%. And that would be at age 32 rather
[18:25] than age
[18:26] 16. That's still very high, right? So
[18:28] for the next 20 years,
[18:31] uh we're still going to be at least in
[18:33] the high double digits and for most of
[18:36] that we're time we're going to be over
[18:39] 20%. And I think between now and 2045,
[18:41] it's something like averaging 29%
[18:45] compounded, but it's front weighted,
[18:46] which we like. We like you being
[18:49] weighted towards the front
[18:51] end. The the biggest question I always
[18:53] get with the power law, the power law in
[18:56] US dollar, not the power law in in gold,
[18:58] which is also the reason I like the one
[19:01] in gold
[19:02] more. What if we hit hyperinflation?
[19:04] Like what if what if um the the the
[19:08] supply is
[19:09] just outgrowing a lot and and we hit uh
[19:13] events that we already hit like how how
[19:16] is the power looking in the Argentine
[19:19] peso or the Turkish lera and stuff like
[19:21] that, right? Well, we don't we don't
[19:25] really bother with that because uh what
[19:28] you're doing is you're measuring Bitcoin
[19:29] against other investable assets, right?
[19:32] So, do you can invest in something
[19:36] that's denominated in fiat? Um, I
[19:39] suppose you could look at the stock
[19:42] market in Turkey and in the stock market
[19:45] in Argentina. I haven't done that. They
[19:48] do somewhat keep up with the inflation.
[19:51] Uh so that might be one way to do the
[19:54] comparison. But clearly if there's an
[19:56] exponential decay in the underlying
[20:00] uh denominator that there could be some
[20:02] issue and this is why we want to compare
[20:04] it to the other sort of hardest things
[20:07] around. Uh gold being harder than the
[20:10] dollar but the dollar
[20:12] being at least until recently you know
[20:14] one of the hardest currencies around.
[20:17] So against the euro, the yen, you know,
[20:20] it works well. Is it is it fair to say
[20:22] that that the power law captures the
[20:24] growth of the asset but not the
[20:27] devaluation of the underlying other
[20:30] asset like the US dollar. So it it
[20:33] captures the the how Bitcoin is growing
[20:36] in in value because there are more users
[20:38] coming in. the users are are getting
[20:40] more into Bitcoin and and and less the
[20:44] the devaluation of of the un under
[20:46] underlying uh uh asset like the US
[20:50] dollar. You know the the devaluation of
[20:52] the US dollar has averaged 7%. If you
[20:55] talk about money
[20:56] supply so roughly it's losing a factor
[21:00] of two per decade. uh money supply
[21:03] growth M2 over long periods of time
[21:06] grows at about 7%. And it's not that
[21:09] different from the
[21:11] OECD M3 which is all of the 38 or so
[21:16] developed countries in the OECD
[21:18] organization that also grows at at
[21:20] roughly that rate. Um you know 42% is a
[21:25] lot larger than 7% and that's that's why
[21:27] we don't see it uh very much at all.
[21:32] And you you have you can do
[21:34] regressions. I've done regressions
[21:37] recently uh comparing including the a
[21:40] term for M3. And what you find is that
[21:47] uh for the parallel core it doesn't make
[21:49] a difference. You seem you notice it in
[21:51] the bubbles but you don't notice that in
[21:54] the parallel core the waiting of those
[21:55] terms just drops very close to zero.
[21:57] Interesting. Makes sense.
[22:00] Perfect. Okay. Um, EMH is the efficient
[22:04] market hypothesis and that's the idea
[22:07] that a stock market behaves like a
[22:10] random walk. Now, that's a random walk
[22:12] around exponential growth because on
[22:14] average the US stock market grows at for
[22:17] the S&P something like 10% on average
[22:21] compounded a little bit higher for for
[22:24] tech stocks for
[22:26] NASDAQ. But then you know it economists
[22:29] and financial professionals will often
[22:32] model that as logn normal distribution
[22:35] or gausian and say that there's
[22:36] reversion to mean and over long periods
[22:39] of time there is reversion to mean and
[22:41] it it behaves like that exponential. Of
[22:43] course you can have very severe events
[22:46] that break log normal. You get these
[22:49] black swans things go five six seven
[22:51] sigma right when you have huge market
[22:55] crashes. Eventually you do get
[22:58] reversion. Bitcoin is not market
[23:00] efficient at all. And somebody four
[23:03] years ago did a literature review and
[23:06] they found 25 different studies of
[23:10] Bitcoin and there were some other
[23:12] cryptos studied but always bitcoin was
[23:14] part of it. There are many different
[23:16] methods and this quote shows a list of
[23:19] all the methods that have been used. Uh
[23:23] personally I've used dtrended
[23:24] fluctuation analysis. is the Hurst
[23:26] exponent test which I'm going to present
[23:29] to you the OS model which we've just
[23:32] shown you along with QR quantitative the
[23:36] augmented dicky filler test we've done
[23:38] but right now I'm going to show you the
[23:40] Hurst exponent test
[23:43] now 20 again 20 of 25 studies said no
[23:48] Bitcoin didn't does not follow this kind
[23:51] of reversion to mean random walk but
[23:53] they all missed the most significant
[23:55] thing which is the power law theory
[23:58] because what they did is they looked at
[23:59] prices in correlation with other assets
[24:02] and they just looked at price variation
[24:04] from you know one day to the next or one
[24:07] week to the next and they looked at
[24:09] percentage changes or logarithmic
[24:11] changes in the in the price. Normally
[24:13] when you do these kinds of tests you
[24:15] drend but they're just dtrending by that
[24:18] sort of exponential typical rise that
[24:21] you see in the into money supply or in
[24:25] stocks. They're not dtrending by a paral
[24:27] law. Now let's go on and look at Hurst
[24:29] exponents and just a setup for what that
[24:32] is. It was first published in
[24:35] 1951 by a British hydraologist. He was
[24:38] studying the long-term storage capacity
[24:41] of Nile
[24:42] River. But uh it's an interesting test
[24:45] statistical technique and it's been used
[24:47] in hydrarology and environmental
[24:49] science. It's been used in physics and
[24:52] complex systems analysis, neuroscience,
[24:55] image processing, network, internet
[24:57] traffic
[24:58] analysis, social sciences and finance.
[25:01] So you can see how it might be relevant
[25:03] to Bitcoin where we have, you know, a
[25:05] network, we have a social science
[25:08] component, we have finance component,
[25:10] and it's a power law. It's a little bit
[25:13] different power law than what I've just
[25:16] shown you, but I'll I'll show you the
[25:17] definition. What you do is you take uh
[25:21] the residuals. So you fit like a mean or
[25:24] something some trend and then you take
[25:27] the residuals from the
[25:29] trend and then you you create these
[25:31] windows of different size within your
[25:33] overall data set. So you look at
[25:35] portions of the data set and you look at
[25:38] the maximal range.
[25:41] In order to get that, you do all the
[25:42] partial sums within your window and then
[25:45] you find the max and the minimum from
[25:47] all those partial sums. That's called R,
[25:50] the range. You take the difference of
[25:51] the max and the minimum. You take the
[25:54] standard deviation within that window
[25:57] size. And then what you find is that the
[25:59] ratio of the range to the standard
[26:02] deviation has a parallel behavior where
[26:06] it depends on the size of the
[26:08] window time and growth with some
[26:11] exponent and it's sublinear growth. So
[26:14] the hearse exponent is normally between
[26:16] 0 and
[26:17] one and if it's 0.5 it would be a random
[26:20] walk and if it's less than 0.5 the
[26:24] closer it is to zero it's mean reversion
[26:26] behavior. this, you know,
[26:29] um, kind of more quickly going back to
[26:32] the mean than a random walk would. If
[26:35] it's above 0.5, it's trending. And the
[26:38] more above 0.5, the more it's trending.
[26:42] So the idea is that there's some memory
[26:43] in there and then it's an inefficient
[26:46] market. Um so the next slide is a study
[26:50] that
[26:51] uh was done by by a different author was
[26:55] published two years ago in the central
[26:57] European economic
[26:59] journal is Bitcoin and emerging
[27:02] market and they used this method with
[27:05] daily prices but they excluded weekends
[27:08] because they were comparing Bitcoin to
[27:10] emerging market stocks and the red line
[27:13] is what they found for Bitcoin's
[27:15] behavior. The blue is for the emerging
[27:17] market. So they did find persistence. It
[27:20] was always above 0.5. It never reached
[27:24] 75. So they found that uh you know it's
[27:28] not efficient. It does does have
[27:30] persistence. But they use the usual
[27:32] dtrending method which is just looking
[27:35] at the ratio of the price from one day
[27:38] to the
[27:39] next and then taking the natural log of
[27:42] that and and using that as the
[27:44] definition of the residual. So this
[27:46] ignores the fundamental parallel nature
[27:49] of
[27:49] Bitcoin. So I thought well I should redo
[27:52] this understanding that there's a
[27:55] parallel and I also used a much broader
[27:58] interval. They they used about
[28:02] uh well they've got eight years of data.
[28:04] It's not bad. I used all the data in the
[28:08] full price history when we had price
[28:11] discovery
[28:14] basically you know kicked off pretty
[28:16] well which was the middle of 2010 all
[28:19] the way through you know the end of 2024
[28:21] and into 2025. So that's that's the full
[28:24] price history. I looked at it both with
[28:26] weekly intervals and with daily
[28:29] intervals. But first I took out the
[28:32] power law. So I did quantile regression.
[28:34] I took the median level which is the 0.5
[28:37] level. I drended using the power law and
[28:40] then I took you know the log residuals
[28:43] relative to that underlying
[28:45] parallel and with both weekly and full
[28:48] price history daily
[28:51] uh we get around 0.9 or higher. And I
[28:54] did this for both fiat and gold. So in
[28:57] this
[28:58] chart, the daily in fiat is green with a
[29:03] D and a cross. And in gold, it's, you
[29:06] know, gold color. And you can see it's
[29:09] very close to one. It's 0.97 and 0.96
[29:13] for fiat and for gold respectively with
[29:16] over 5,000 data points.
[29:19] And even with the weekly with 750 data
[29:22] points, we got
[29:25] 087.89 for fiat and gold
[29:28] respectively. And this method requires a
[29:30] lot of data. You want to have ideally
[29:33] thousands of data points. So the the
[29:35] daily one is we can put uh more
[29:38] confidence in. This is very strong
[29:41] persistence. You just you just don't see
[29:43] this in financial data
[29:45] uh with numbers so far above 75 which is
[29:49] very clearly trending and and really
[29:52] around 0.9 or
[29:54] higher and to validate the whole method
[29:58] you know I looked at spy I used an
[30:01] exponential
[30:02] dtrend and I used that DFA technique
[30:05] that's mentioned uh in one of the
[30:08] previous slides and the result for 10
[30:10] years of spy I showed strong mean
[30:13] reversion with H of only.18 which
[30:16] wouldn't be on even on the chart here
[30:17] because this chart starts at 0.05 which
[30:19] is random so it would be off the bottom
[30:22] of the chart. Okay. Then we wanted to
[30:24] look at the time behavior. How does this
[30:26] exhurst exponent evolve with
[30:29] time? And now I've got uh a plot which
[30:33] is log linear and it's showing the
[30:35] linear age from age 2 to age 16.
[30:39] And in order to get enough data, I had
[30:41] to use hourly
[30:43] data. And
[30:45] also there's no
[30:48] uh backward-looking correlation here or
[30:52] analysis. What I did
[30:55] is I kept repeating the quantile
[30:58] regression. So it only included all the
[31:00] data up to a given time. So you know if
[31:03] I'm starting at at year two or three, I
[31:05] only do the quantile regression for data
[31:07] up to that time.
[31:10] And then I calculate the hearse exponent
[31:12] within a one-year window and then I step
[31:14] by one quarter quarter of a year. So
[31:17] I've got data points at each quarter of
[31:19] a year. So those are you know you've got
[31:22] the price is the blue
[31:24] line and that's the axis on the right
[31:27] hand side the y ais. The hurst exponent
[31:30] is the left hand side y ais. You can see
[31:33] it's all above 0.9 for the entire price
[31:36] history.
[31:38] uh with using these one-year windows. So
[31:40] again, it's a very inefficient market or
[31:44] really very
[31:46] persistent power law style price
[31:48] behavior because that's the underlying
[31:50] assumption. The power law it's slowly
[31:53] coming down from being, you know, around
[31:56] one to around 0.95 now. And I've also
[32:01] colorcoded it by whether we're in the
[32:03] parallel core or in the bubble or in the
[32:06] transition
[32:07] zone. The parallel core is the lowest
[32:11] 40% of the
[32:13] residuals and the bubble is the top 40%
[32:16] of the
[32:17] residuals relative to the trend. And the
[32:20] transition, which is marked in yellow,
[32:23] is the middle 20%. And I repeated this
[32:25] with even finer resolution. Again,
[32:28] they're one-year windows, but I used 1/8
[32:30] of a year time
[32:32] step. And we see the same kind of
[32:36] result. Um, and the other interesting
[32:39] thing that you can see here is that uh
[32:42] you see peaks in the Hurst
[32:45] exponent. And those peaks are occurring
[32:49] a year to a year and a about a year and
[32:51] a quarter before the price peak. And
[32:53] I've got arrows that are indicating
[32:55] this. So, we've got three or four peaks
[32:59] in the Hurst exponent and then the
[33:01] arrows showing the price peaks in
[33:05] Bitcoin, you know, a year and a quarter
[33:07] later
[33:08] roughly. And uh the last peak was
[33:13] tentatively
[33:15] uh sometime
[33:17] in the middle of last
[33:20] year and it hasn't gone on to you know
[33:23] go above that since. If you reject that
[33:26] forward, it it takes us really to the
[33:28] end of
[33:30] 2025 for a possible correlation with the
[33:33] price peak in Bitcoin. I also took the
[33:36] residuals and randomized them
[33:38] all as a validation test and I got an H
[33:42] of
[33:43] 0.51. So it proves the methodology by
[33:46] randomizing all the all these residuals
[33:49] you got straight reversion
[33:52] deed. This is a table of when the Hurst
[33:55] peaks occurred
[33:58] uh and the corresponding bubble. So for
[34:01] the 2013 bubble, the peak was a year
[34:03] earlier in June. The Bitcoin peak was
[34:06] 2013 in December. 2017 it was a year
[34:10] earlier in
[34:12] September. And the Bitcoin peak again
[34:14] was in December of
[34:16] 2017. for
[34:18] 2021. It was over a year earlier in mid
[34:22] 2019. The Bitcoin peak is
[34:25] 2021 April. Now, that's a double peak.
[34:29] And my argument is that the first peak
[34:31] is the true peak because it had the
[34:33] largest residual away from the power
[34:34] law. The second peak looks higher, but
[34:37] the power law trend price was higher as
[34:40] well. And so, in terms of residuals, it
[34:42] was it was not higher. And then the
[34:45] interval from the Hurst peak to the
[34:47] Bitcoin peak is shown in
[34:49] days. And the average of that is 546
[34:52] days, which is a year and a half. And uh
[34:55] the the most recent Hurst peak was in
[34:57] June of 2024 at the beginning of that
[35:00] month. So if you project the average
[35:03] forward, it would be December of 2025.
[35:05] Let's take a break for a moment and
[35:07] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[35:10] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[35:12] watches. Those watches are the most
[35:15] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[35:18] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[35:21] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[35:24] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:27] watch collections. You have the date of
[35:30] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[35:33] there. And of course, also the block
[35:35] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:38] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:41] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:44] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:46] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:49] love those watches so so much. And now
[35:52] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:55] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:57] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:59] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[36:01] first way is you put it on a hardware
[36:03] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[36:06] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[36:09] BitBox Bitcoin only edition. For that,
[36:12] it's a super simple and secure way. And
[36:15] if you check out the link in the
[36:16] description, you even get 5% off if you
[36:19] use the code Robin. And the second way
[36:22] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[36:25] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[36:28] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[36:31] They will personalize for you a
[36:34] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:36] your individual situation. They will
[36:39] show you how you can secure your own
[36:42] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:44] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:46] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:48] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:51] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:54] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:56] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:59] last but not least, if you're in a
[37:00] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[37:03] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[37:05] that, head over to the
[37:09] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[37:12] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[37:15] be for the first time ever speaking at
[37:17] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[37:20] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[37:23] really looking forward to seeing all of
[37:25] you there. You can get your ticket in
[37:27] the link down in the description of
[37:30] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[37:32] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:36] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:37] there. We'll see. The next slide is to
[37:40] show more clearly these zones. A bubble
[37:44] zone, accumulation zone, it's called
[37:47] here. It's the core power law. And then
[37:49] these transition zones.
[37:53] uh these are weekly data
[37:57] points. These residuals are normalized.
[38:00] So I took uh cuz I was trying to kind of
[38:03] normalize across the different bubbles
[38:05] because the bubbles are going down. And
[38:06] even with the normalization, you still
[38:08] see kind of a downward
[38:11] trend. But it's it's the the
[38:14] residuals from the power law in
[38:17] logarithmic terms
[38:20] uh normalized to the
[38:22] peaks. And you see the the power law
[38:25] support in the core with the green
[38:29] dots. You see the transitions with the
[38:31] yellow dots. And then you see the bubble
[38:33] areas in the red dots. And it's
[38:36] remarkable that once it moves into a
[38:39] bubble zone, it just stays there. It
[38:40] doesn't go back and forth into the
[38:42] yellow zone or the green zone. It just
[38:44] stays there until the whole bubble has
[38:47] played out and then it crosses into the
[38:50] yellow transition zone. And then it goes
[38:52] back to the core, what you might call
[38:54] the accumulation zone, and then on to
[38:57] the next transition zone, and then back
[39:00] to another
[39:01] peak, and then down. And then we had a a
[39:04] kind of small bubble, kind of a fake out
[39:07] that didn't sustain very well. And then
[39:09] we went back through transition the
[39:11] core. And then we go to the next one,
[39:13] which is a double bubble. And that's
[39:17] 2021. And then on the very right hand
[39:19] side of the chart, you see a few red
[39:23] dots. And that was uh what happened
[39:26] around the election and and the
[39:27] excitement around that and the strategic
[39:29] Bitcoin reserve. and that did not
[39:32] sustain as we know the the price came
[39:34] back in in the transition zone where it
[39:36] is
[39:37] now. So there actually two charts here.
[39:39] One is the fiat chart, the other is the
[39:41] gold chart. They look very
[39:44] similar, but it's worth noting that the
[39:47] very right hand side of the gold chart,
[39:49] it went into the transition zone. It
[39:51] never went into the bubble zone. So we
[39:54] did not get confirmation of this from
[39:56] the gold chart. By the way, this
[39:58] technique is called hidden markoff
[39:59] modeling. And what it does is it kind of
[40:02] uh tries to analyze which of the zones
[40:06] it's in. And so it will tend to stay in
[40:08] that zone a little longer than if you
[40:11] just did a strict cut off and said,
[40:12] "Okay, I'm going to take the upper 40%."
[40:15] But it maps pretty well into just
[40:17] saying, "Well, I'll just take the upper
[40:18] 40%." They don't look all that too, you
[40:21] know, all that very different. And this
[40:23] technique is used in handwriting
[40:25] recognition and speech analysis. It's
[40:28] used in DNA sequencing and of course
[40:30] it's used in financial time series
[40:32] particularly to look for regime
[40:34] switching between low volatility and
[40:36] high volatility regimes. Certainly our
[40:39] bubbles are high volatility regimes. And
[40:41] here's what chat GPT
[40:44] uh has as an interpretation of something
[40:47] called the transition matrix which shows
[40:49] how easily you move from one zone to the
[40:52] other. It says the bubbles are highly
[40:56] persistent. 98% chance that Bitcoin
[40:58] would stay in the bubble once it's
[41:00] there. A low probability of reverting to
[41:03] mid, you know, as you go from one week
[41:05] to the
[41:06] next. Slow transitions rarely jump
[41:09] between extreme
[41:11] states and no direct high to low
[41:13] transitions. It never moves from green
[41:15] to red directly. It always goes through
[41:17] these transition zones first. And that
[41:19] suggests gradual cycles rather than
[41:22] sudden crashes. And we know our bubbles
[41:23] play out for longer than a year. They
[41:26] tend to be almost a year up and a year
[41:29] down. And then we've got these mid-
[41:31] regimes as transition
[41:33] zones. Bitcoin in the mid-range. State
[41:35] one is more likely to stay there. And
[41:38] when transitioning, it's slightly more
[41:39] likely to fall back to low than surge
[41:41] into high.
[41:43] So momentum from mid to high is weak
[41:46] which is kind of interesting on
[41:47] liquidity analysis that I've done
[41:49] separately but don't have time to show
[41:52] here but it shows that liquidity growth
[41:55] can kick off bubbles but it doesn't
[41:57] sustain them. It takes more it takes
[41:59] really momentum of players in the market
[42:03] um coming in. My conclusion from all
[42:06] this is that God candles aren't really a
[42:08] thing. That you get, you know,
[42:10] transitional behavior and that that
[42:12] behavior follows through and the bubbles
[42:14] go and eventually you get runaway and
[42:17] you get some very big candles at the
[42:19] end, but then those can collapse pretty
[42:21] quickly. It's super interesting. So,
[42:23] basically what I I got from that is that
[42:26] we haven't really seen a bubble this
[42:29] this time around. it was kind of a a
[42:31] fake bubble, small a small smalish one
[42:34] and that it's likely to come I mean
[42:37] obviously that it's not 100% but it's
[42:41] likely to come uh December 2025 so end
[42:43] of 2025. This god has a super
[42:46] interesting discussion of of a god
[42:48] candle. I mean I think Samson Mau is
[42:51] probably the one that uh popularized it
[42:53] the most. I think uh this god kind of
[42:56] like oh like we I think he even is is
[42:59] famous for saying before we hit the 100k
[43:02] he said oh no when when the ETFs ETFs
[43:06] came he said if the ETFs come we will go
[43:10] to a million very quickly obviously that
[43:12] did not happen um and it was also very
[43:15] unlikely but it's it's interesting how
[43:18] there are people in Bitcoin that say oh
[43:21] yeah like bit Bitcoin will have that
[43:23] gradual moment moment and yes maybe
[43:26] eventually in the US dollar it will
[43:28] break to the upside if the US dollar
[43:30] just disappears but then this then it
[43:33] does not make sense to measure it in the
[43:34] US dollar and then there are people oh
[43:37] like we will hit that moment and all of
[43:38] the sudden bitcoin will will grow which
[43:41] does not make a whole lot of sense to me
[43:44] because like what event has to happen
[43:47] that everyone all of the sudden gets
[43:49] bitcoin I I I've seen it in in my own
[43:53] family. I evangelize since what is it
[43:56] almost 5 years and the people closest to
[43:59] me get it the best uh and they have
[44:01] Bitcoin but the more I go outside
[44:05] uh in in the and I have a really big
[44:07] family the further I go outside in the
[44:10] family even though I evangelize for some
[44:13] five years and I really drop like hints
[44:15] and and and this is that and this and
[44:17] that they still don't like we maybe
[44:20] upgraded our communications but we
[44:23] didn't upgrade the human brain and we
[44:25] need time to grasp it and I needed 3
[44:27] years to go over that Bitcoin is a scam.
[44:30] So I do like the gradual approach more
[44:34] and it's interesting and it's good to
[44:37] see data proof of that God candles
[44:41] probably aren't the thing. Yes. Well,
[44:43] you know, uh, moderate exponentials can
[44:47] sustain over long periods of time, and
[44:48] that applies to stock market and dollar
[44:50] and so forth, but very rapid
[44:53] exponentials cannot sustain. They're
[44:55] sort of mathematically
[44:58] unstable. And so, you know, in physics,
[45:01] we see them mostly in decay,
[45:04] um, not in rises. And so, when we get
[45:08] this exponential runaway, it's got the
[45:10] seeds of its own decay built in.
[45:13] The power law is persistent. It goes on
[45:16] and on and it can persist much better
[45:18] than an exponential can and that's a
[45:21] good thing. And volatility coming down
[45:24] is is also a good thing because it makes
[45:26] it more acceptable to this, you know,
[45:29] broader community, right? Uh people are
[45:31] afraid of Bitcoin because of its
[45:34] volatility and it is coming down at uh
[45:38] you know, not an insignificant rate.
[45:40] It's actually dropping as a power law
[45:42] almost as the inverse of of its age.
[45:44] Okay. Um it turns out that as we know
[45:49] Bitcoin has a lot of skew you know skew
[45:51] to the upside right which we call the
[45:53] right
[45:54] tail. And it turns out that you cannot
[45:57] fit it well with a single Gaussian. You
[45:59] cannot fit it well with a gamma function
[46:02] which would give you a right tail. But a
[46:04] gamma function will not fit both the
[46:07] left peak here and the gap in between
[46:10] the two peaks here. But it a double
[46:13] Gaussian will fit quite well. So the
[46:17] green one is the power law core. That's
[46:19] the first
[46:21] Gaussian. It's got a mean that's
[46:23] slightly below zero. These are the log
[46:25] 10 of the residuals on the x- axis and
[46:28] then the you know the frequency of the
[46:31] observation on the y ais.
[46:34] and it's much narrower, so it's got less
[46:38] volatility, right? And then the red
[46:40] line, the second Gaussian, is the one
[46:42] that applies to the
[46:44] bubbles and its mean is much higher.
[46:47] It's 31, which is a factor of two
[46:50] because it's log 10 and 10 the.3 is a
[46:53] factor two above the zero line. And the
[46:56] difference between these two, you know,
[46:59] dash vertical lines is is 044 in the
[47:02] log. That's a factor 2 and a half. So
[47:04] that's a very significant price
[47:06] difference. And the second Gaussian is
[47:09] much wider. It's got a volatility that's
[47:11] three times higher. A standard deviation
[47:14] that's.3 in the log instead of
[47:17] 0.1. The big one is for fiat. The small
[47:20] one's for gold. You see it for gold as
[47:22] well. For some reason, it chat didn't
[47:25] draw the two curves the same way, but
[47:27] it's it's two Gaussians again and very
[47:31] good separation. Separation you see with
[47:33] the two blue dashed lines, you know,
[47:36] it's.5 there, which is a factor three in
[47:40] price and almost equal weights in the
[47:42] two. So, that's f further validation of
[47:45] parallel core plus uh the bubbles. Now
[47:50] if there's a parallel core what you can
[47:52] do is you can redo your regressions
[47:55] by removing half the data. So we take
[47:59] just the first
[48:01] Gaussian which was defined by doing a
[48:04] quantile regression and then taking
[48:06] residuals and using the median quantile
[48:10] regression. And now we repeat the
[48:12] regression on just half the data which
[48:14] is the the data that was below the line
[48:16] in the first one. And when we do that we
[48:19] get very very tight
[48:21] relationship. This extends over the full
[48:24] history. And now this is regressions
[48:27] both ordinary le square and the
[48:29] different quantile levels. And the one
[48:31] that's most interesting is 0.5 the
[48:34] yellow line. But you can see
[48:36] how you know how close they are. There's
[48:39] almost no dispersion. And the R squares
[48:42] are incredibly high. They're N98
[48:45] and.997. And the mean power law index is
[48:48] is somewhat higher than you get when you
[48:50] regress all the data including the
[48:52] bubbles. It's about
[48:55] 5.9 with a very tight range of the
[48:57] slopes for these seven different uh
[49:00] quantile functions. So the the idea in
[49:04] terms of a physics analogy is uh if you
[49:08] think about fluid flow, you have laminer
[49:10] flow and turbulent
[49:11] flow and you have this in in your in
[49:14] your heart uh and in the aorta that
[49:16] comes out of your heart is the largest
[49:19] vessel and you know from one heartbeat
[49:23] to the next. It moves from laminar flow
[49:25] into turbulent flow and it's
[49:27] transitional and if you're fortunate it
[49:29] doesn't get too turbulent. If it's too
[49:31] turbulent, that's a sign that you've got
[49:32] heart disease because you've got some
[49:34] obstruction in your
[49:36] aorta. But it does get more chaotic. Um,
[49:40] so in laminer flow, it's stable and
[49:42] ordered and that refers to the paral
[49:46] trend. That's the core and the
[49:48] transition zone. It's starting to, you
[49:51] know, have some increased volatility,
[49:53] but it's not fully turbulent.
[49:56] And the you see the heartbeat uh the
[49:59] vessel diagram there and turbulent flow
[50:02] it's it's higher energy more
[50:05] chaotic and you you're growing
[50:07] exponentially above the power law. So
[50:09] there's a correlation between laminer is
[50:12] the green color yellow for transitional
[50:15] red for
[50:16] turbulent that's shown in terms of these
[50:18] residuals with these sharp bubbles with
[50:21] respect to medium. And then I've shown
[50:23] the the one sigma plus or minus for the
[50:27] each of those separate zones. So those
[50:29] are the bands that you see. But it's
[50:31] amazing how well separated there are.
[50:33] The transition regions are are pretty
[50:35] small and pretty sharp. Uh these are
[50:39] zcores for the bubble phase which are
[50:41] just the number of standard deviations.
[50:43] So here I've thrown away the other data
[50:44] and we're only looking at the
[50:46] bubbles. And so they're mostly positive
[50:49] zcores from 0 to three and then you know
[50:53] down to 2 and 1/2 and then down to two
[50:55] and then down to
[50:58] 1.0. Uh so we are seeing that the
[51:01] volatility has has clearly been
[51:03] dropping. Uh the zero line is a big jump
[51:07] in price already. It's it's a 2.75 times
[51:10] higher than the core power law price.
[51:12] And then we're seeing, you know, a
[51:14] little bit of bubble that that happened
[51:18] in earlier in in uh 2024 with the ETF
[51:22] excitement that did not sustain. It's
[51:25] it's also interesting that the rises are
[51:27] a little bit sharper than the falls on
[51:28] these. So the very sharp rise and it
[51:30] takes longer for the reversion. People
[51:34] are a little bit denial in the in the
[51:36] bare market phase. This is another way
[51:37] of looking at these um showing of the
[51:41] linear deviation in percentage
[51:43] terms which initially could be as high
[51:46] as
[51:47] 800%. And then you know 600 and then 400
[51:50] and then down to 200% for the most
[51:53] recent
[51:54] bubbles and also showing the the full
[51:58] bubble period is shaded. And we see that
[52:00] the bubbles got a little
[52:02] wider particularly in comparison to the
[52:05] first bubble. And
[52:08] uh this is showing the top 40%. So it's
[52:11] the 0.6 quantile and above. And now what
[52:14] we can do is we can look at how much
[52:15] energy is in that
[52:17] bubble. And I just define the energy as
[52:19] the percentage. It's the integral under
[52:22] the curve. So it's the energy
[52:24] uh integrated over the time period of
[52:27] the bubble. And then you take the
[52:29] average of that over the bubble and you
[52:33] define something called the
[52:35] power. And if you look at the Bitcoin
[52:38] power in percentage per
[52:40] year and plot it against market
[52:44] cap, it falls off as a power law. And
[52:47] with a very high R squared. Now, we've
[52:48] only got four data
[52:50] points. It it's not a a steep power law.
[52:53] It's it's a mild power law. So it falls
[52:56] from in these units percent per year
[52:59] from 300 down to
[53:03] uh about
[53:05] 80 projected to go to 60% by the year
[53:10] 2031. As market cap though has grown you
[53:13] know from a tenth of a
[53:16] billion to you know
[53:19] 1.6 1.7 trillion today.
[53:24] And uh it's it turns out to be a
[53:26] parallel to the 17th of the market cap
[53:29] which is interesting and I'll explain
[53:32] why. If we project this into the next
[53:35] bubble we would say well maybe price
[53:37] gets up to 200
[53:39] 250,000 maximum. So it market cap might
[53:44] be let's say 4 trillion. So that's
[53:48] marked with the B. and uh you know will
[53:52] that happen this year or next? We don't
[53:53] quite know but it should fit that curve
[53:55] recently. Now the other smaller plot is
[53:59] the same idea but it's the Bitcoin
[54:01] bubble power versus age. The same four
[54:04] points but plotted against linear age.
[54:08] And you can fit it with the reciprocal
[54:10] or with a power law. The reciprocal has
[54:13] this extra term which keeps it from
[54:16] going to infinity at uh time zero.
[54:21] But at longer times it's 1 / t. The
[54:25] power law is slightly less steep. It's t
[54:27] the minus.83. Both of them fit the data
[54:30] pretty well. But the t to the minus.83
[54:33] 83 matches
[54:37] uh the 1 over7th power that we see in
[54:41] the large chart because market cap goes
[54:44] essentially is t to the 6 power
[54:47] particularly now that the bitcoin supply
[54:48] is barely changing. bubble power versus
[54:51] market cap to the minus
[54:53] 107, you know, is consistent with market
[54:56] cap growing as the sixth power of time
[54:59] and with the bubble power versus
[55:02] age going as on this chart t the
[55:06] minus.83. Now there's a reason why this
[55:09] should be true. The average
[55:11] power should be the reciprocal of the
[55:13] age roughly.
[55:16] uh price goes
[55:18] as the kth power of time. K is about
[55:22] 5.8. The first derivative normalized to
[55:26] price itself is dp over p is just k * t
[55:31] the k minus one divided by the power law
[55:34] itself t the k. So the percentage change
[55:37] in in price to first order is k over t
[55:41] where k is this 5.8 8 which is the index
[55:43] of the power law and t is the
[55:45] age. So right now it's 5.8 divided by
[55:48] 16.3 right and that gives you something
[55:52] like 40%. Now the hypothesis is that for
[55:56] the bubble power that it would be
[55:57] proportional to the capital
[55:59] inest but it turns out the capital inest
[56:02] also has to be k over t. And the reason
[56:06] is that the percentage price move is
[56:09] equal to the market
[56:10] multiple times the capital inest divided
[56:13] by the number of coins. But the number
[56:15] of coins is now more or less
[56:18] fixed. And over long periods of time the
[56:21] market multiple has been about 2 and a
[56:23] half. It does change in the bubbles. It
[56:25] goes up with FOMO and with momentum. The
[56:29] market multiple does go up but over long
[56:31] periods of time it's been measured to be
[56:33] about 2 and a half. So if the number of
[56:35] coins is roughly fixed, the capital of
[56:38] injest should be a percentage of market
[56:41] cap. And if the m market multiple is
[56:44] roughly fixed, it should be proportional
[56:46] to the price move which is proportional
[56:48] to k overt. So the capital inest is also
[56:51] proportional k
[56:53] /t. And so that could drive the bubble
[56:56] power. And so then the bubble power
[56:58] should go as the roughly the inverse
[57:01] of t inverse of the age. And that's what
[57:06] we measure. Okay, this one is another
[57:08] one that's saying no god
[57:10] candle at least not in Q2. We're not
[57:12] going to reach 250,000 this quarter.
[57:16] Here we are already, you know, almost
[57:18] onethird through
[57:20] Q2. This is just the rolling 13week log
[57:24] return. So this is how much can you get
[57:27] in one quarter for Bitcoin price to go
[57:30] up and in the last 7 years the highest
[57:34] value you get is a factor three which is
[57:38] 0.5 in the log
[57:39] 10. So don't expect a factor of three
[57:42] just in a single quarter. We we just
[57:45] haven't you know seen it go above that
[57:48] and and we know volatility is coming
[57:49] down so we would not expect it to shoot
[57:52] above that. So, if you're going to get
[57:54] to 250,000, it's probably going to take
[57:56] at least 6 months. All right, I'm going
[57:58] to close
[58:00] um with Kelly analysis. People may have
[58:04] seen charts like this. Fidelity has a
[58:07] very nice chart that had
[58:10] uh 24 different asset classes. I think
[58:14] this one has 16 asset classes, 10 years
[58:17] of returns. About half of these asset
[58:20] classes are
[58:21] debt, different forms of debt, treasury
[58:25] debt, mortgage back securities,
[58:27] municipals, and so forth. And the rest
[58:30] of course are stocks, you know, large
[58:33] caps, small caps, international
[58:35] equities, and then it's also got
[58:37] Bitcoin. It's also got gold. It's also
[58:40] got real estate, which is REITs. And as
[58:43] those of us who live in the Bitcoin
[58:45] world know, eight out of 10 years,
[58:48] Bitcoin was the number one
[58:51] asset. And we see that in the in the
[58:53] dark blue right at the top. Eight out of
[58:55] 10 years. One year Treasury debt. You
[58:58] know, that was a terrible year. 2018,
[59:00] Treasury debt returned 2%. Everything
[59:02] else lost money pretty
[59:04] much. And then in 2022,
[59:08] uh, commodities did well. that was
[59:11] probably a knock on effect from the
[59:14] supply chain dislocations of of COVID
[59:17] and then the you know the big liquidity
[59:20] response to that. And we also know that
[59:23] Bitcoin has bad years and had crashes in
[59:27] 2018 and 2022 and it was the absolutely
[59:30] worst
[59:31] asset. And this is what's scaring away
[59:34] your distant relatives and friends.
[59:36] Robin is uh you know the the the big
[59:40] crashes. But when we take it all into
[59:42] account, we can do a Kelly analysis and
[59:45] Bitcoin is still the superior asset
[59:47] class. So I'll show you how we do this.
[59:50] First of all, I threw away the eight
[59:51] classes that have debt because none of
[59:53] those, you know, return much. You know,
[59:56] they're all singledigit percent. So
[59:57] they're just not in the running. So we
[60:00] have eight classes here. Bitcoin, broad
[60:02] tax, small caps, large caps, real
[60:04] estate, gold, commodities, international
[60:07] equities. That's eight
[60:09] classes. And in order to do a Kelly
[60:12] analysis, the optimal Kelly fraction
[60:15] that you want to allocate is given by
[60:17] the equation in the upper
[60:19] right. It's equal to this term P which
[60:22] is the probability that you have a
[60:24] winning
[60:25] year relative to whatever you're
[60:27] measuring against which could be you
[60:30] know dollar could be euro could be gold
[60:33] but here it's dollars and then you
[60:36] subtract from your win rate you subtract
[60:40] your loss rate which is 1 minus P. So if
[60:43] you have an 80% win percentage as we did
[60:46] with 8 out of 10 then for Bitcoin 1
[60:48] minus P is 0.2
[60:49] two and then you divide that by this
[60:52] term B. Now B is all important because
[60:55] it's the average win rate divided by the
[60:59] average loss rate in absolute terms or
[61:02] since losses are negative you use a
[61:04] minus sign. So the average win over the
[61:07] average loss you know correct it for the
[61:09] minus sign and the loss or the absolute
[61:11] value. So it becomes a positive number.
[61:15] So what we've tabulated here is under P
[61:19] for each asset
[61:20] class the win rate which for Bitcoin was
[61:23] 08 and even if you only take the five
[61:26] years because you say volatility is
[61:28] coming down and the win rate the average
[61:31] return is less
[61:33] uh it's still 08. Then you take the
[61:36] average win which for Bitcoin was an
[61:37] incredible 292% in percentage terms.
[61:41] Everything else was pretty much in
[61:43] double digits.
[61:45] Bitcoin only five years it was 155%.
[61:47] That was the
[61:48] average. Of course the loss rates were
[61:51] high an average of
[61:54] minus70 or more recently you know still
[61:57] high 5 years it was minus 68. Everything
[62:01] else is double digits you know less than
[62:03] 20% except for commodities a loss of
[62:06] 23% of gold 8%. You take the ratio of W
[62:10] to W over L. You throw away the minus
[62:13] sign. And for Bitcoin, it's a factor of
[62:15] four, which is great. So you're taking P
[62:18] of 0.8
[62:20] minus.2 / 4, which means 005 for that
[62:25] second term, and the answer is 75. So
[62:28] that says if you're choosing between
[62:30] Bitcoin and cash and you're using very
[62:33] importantly you're using a one-year
[62:35] window for this analysis because you get
[62:37] very different answers if you use daily,
[62:40] weekly or quarterly or
[62:42] monthly. But if you use a one-year
[62:44] decision window, you get 75% allocation
[62:47] to Bitcoin and 25% to cash. The next
[62:50] best is broadte
[62:53] 66 and then the next after that is large
[62:56] caps which is similar to broadte
[62:59] 52%
[63:02] gold.36 commodities were negative so you
[63:04] don't want to be in commodities and if
[63:06] you took only 5 years of bitcoin you
[63:08] still got
[63:09] 7.71 so even with the returns coming
[63:13] down the volatility came down as well
[63:17] now you can correct for the risk-free
[63:19] rate and I use 4%. So if you're getting
[63:22] 4% or 5% in your treasury bills, you can
[63:25] correct for that. And then the B ratios
[63:28] come down a little bit. For for Bitcoin,
[63:30] they barely come
[63:32] down because it's so high. And the F
[63:35] only comes down to 75. It's it's still
[63:37] up there, but it makes it quite a
[63:39] difference for some of the others. The
[63:41] broadtech remains high at 6 as the
[63:44] optimal fraction. Small caps went
[63:47] negative once you corrected for the
[63:48] risk-free rate. Real estate went
[63:50] negative after you corrected for the
[63:52] risk-free rate. Commodities went really
[63:55] negative. You don't want to invest in
[63:57] commodities long term. International
[63:59] equities went negative. So unless we
[64:01] get, you know, really severe crash of
[64:04] the dollar, you you don't necessarily
[64:06] want to be in those either. And Bitcoin
[64:09] only five years of history, you still
[64:10] got 7 now. So the top three assets here
[64:15] were Bitcoin,
[64:17] broadtech, and you could pick broadtech
[64:20] or large caps. They're roughly similar.
[64:22] So then I looked at, well, what was the
[64:24] next best one after those? It was
[64:26] gold. And if you took their ratios and
[64:29] then normalized that, you said you
[64:31] wanted to have three assets in the
[64:32] portfolio and you had to normalize it so
[64:34] you don't add up to more than 100%. then
[64:38] it would be 52% Bitcoin, 42%
[64:41] broadte, 6% gold. But if it was only
[64:44] choosing between Bitcoin and cash, it
[64:46] would be, you know, 70 75%
[64:49] Bitcoin. Now, this one is just to show
[64:52] you that if you do the analysis monthly,
[64:54] quarterly, you know, shorter time
[64:56] frames, you get quite different results.
[65:00] So, the optimal F is the last row in
[65:03] here. with a monthly analysis, it's it's
[65:07] 24%.
[65:08] Um, and I just took five years there
[65:11] because I I you know, I didn't want to
[65:14] overweight the high returns in the
[65:16] earlier phases. Quarterly analysis, it's
[65:19] 35%. And with Bitcoin, it's 77% if you
[65:23] took all the data in this case. And if
[65:26] you only took after 2018 for this
[65:28] analysis, it was 56%.
[65:31] But this I did earlier. So it only had
[65:33] half the year of of 2024. So it's
[65:36] slightly different
[65:38] result. Okay. So but the other lesson
[65:41] from this
[65:43] is you know be stoic, be chill because
[65:46] the more chill you are, the more Bitcoin
[65:49] you should hold as a percentage of your
[65:52] liquid capital or wealth. You can
[65:54] justify holding higher and higher
[65:56] percentages. So I'll end with the quote,
[65:59] two quotes. Uh, diversification is
[66:02] protection against ignorance. It makes
[66:03] little sense if you know what you are
[66:06] doing. Uh, Warren Buffett knows what
[66:08] he's doing in stocks. He admits that he
[66:11] doesn't know what he's doing in
[66:14] technology. Uh, he certainly doesn't
[66:16] know what he's doing when it comes to
[66:18] Bitcoin. He should have sold everything
[66:20] and gone to Bitcoin. But still this
[66:22] quote will stand that if we believe we
[66:26] know what we're doing and uh we have
[66:29] some statistics to back us up. If we
[66:32] believe the power law and the power law
[66:34] is persistent as I've shown you with the
[66:36] Hurst exponent and we just look at the
[66:38] Kelly data which doesn't even assume a
[66:40] power
[66:41] law then uh maybe we convince ourselves
[66:45] that we know what we're doing and
[66:46] allocate a large percentage of our
[66:48] wealth to
[66:49] Bitcoin rather than to giving it to Wall
[66:52] Street because giving it to Wall Street
[66:55] is you know give them the money and
[66:58] they'll make sure that they have the
[67:00] yachts. that you don't get rich. That's
[67:03] that's very true. I love that. Huh.
[67:07] So, thank you very much for your
[67:10] time. I'm going to stop sharing. I I
[67:13] love
[67:14] your how how you go about and explain
[67:19] with
[67:20] data why long-term being in
[67:24] Bitcoin and being convinced of it and
[67:27] also why you should study it to in order
[67:30] to be convinced of it otherwise you will
[67:32] never be convinced of it makes sense. I
[67:35] I love that approach because it takes a
[67:38] lot of
[67:39] time. It took a lot of time for me to be
[67:43] detached from the daily price movements
[67:46] and now I only look at the price if I
[67:50] see it on Twitter. I operate in Bitcoin.
[67:54] I uh have cash flow in and out already
[67:58] in Bitcoin for my my business.
[68:02] So I I didn't touch a Bitcoin exchange
[68:05] for I think like four five months now
[68:08] because I get also income in Bitcoin and
[68:11] then and the fear to Bitcoin split is so
[68:14] nicely that I I don't have to exchange
[68:16] one for the other. Actually right now I
[68:19] that will probably change around this
[68:21] year but this stoic approach of I'll
[68:25] study Bitcoin very
[68:27] deeply. I allocate accordingly to my
[68:31] what leaf is and then I have a long time
[68:34] horizon of 5 10 50 maybe if you're young
[68:39] 50 years. So that that's that's great
[68:43] and and I love that you can bring data
[68:46] into that discussion because I always
[68:48] just bring fundamentals and uh why I
[68:52] believe Bitcoin is the future to the
[68:54] discussion uh because I'm just not good
[68:56] with with data uh as good as you
[68:59] definitely not uh and I love that you
[69:01] bring that that data data here and what
[69:04] I also uh to I mean the the two main uh
[69:08] things that people might want to know
[69:10] about number go up technology is we we
[69:14] might hit a quarter million uh this year
[69:16] when we get in the bubble uh bubble um
[69:20] uh area of of it and we're flipping gold
[69:24] which is more importantly but not this
[69:26] year but I think 2032 uh you said uh
[69:30] which is I think the the real opponent
[69:35] uh that that that will the end boss of
[69:38] like if If someone askked me, oh like of
[69:41] course
[69:41] like if you just look at US dollar and
[69:44] Bitcoin like obviously I want more
[69:46] Bitcoin or any theater for that matter
[69:49] but gold in Bitcoin and stocks in
[69:51] Bitcoin and large caps in Bitcoin and
[69:53] then all those things uh the comparison
[69:56] is is way more interesting. So thank you
[69:58] so much for taking the time and and and
[70:00] and bringing data and science to to
[70:04] Bitcoin. Yeah, it it's been my pleasure
[70:07] and my view is gold is our friend. You
[70:10] know, we watch gold, we see it going up
[70:12] and we say great because we know that
[70:14] long-term Bitcoin is parallel against
[70:16] gold. So, absolutely, 100%. Um, I have
[70:20] one question that I ask each and every
[70:21] one of my guests and for returning
[70:23] guests, I modified that question a
[70:26] little bit. What have you learned since
[70:29] you have last been on the show outside
[70:31] of Bitcoin?
[70:33] outside of
[70:35] Bitcoin.
[70:38] Um, everything I learn relates to
[70:43] my two young
[70:45] sons. So that's, you know, my life
[70:48] revolves around two
[70:50] poles, the family and and Bitcoin.
[70:53] And uh you know that one of the reasons
[70:58] I came to Bitcoin was that um I had
[71:02] these children late in life
[71:05] and you know I had retired already and
[71:09] uh I wanted to stay retired
[71:12] uh retired with Bitcoin and so it
[71:16] was you know in the same way that Sailor
[71:18] talks about how he had this huge
[71:20] challenge with his company that he
[71:23] couldn't beat the hurdle rate and they
[71:25] couldn't compete with the large
[71:27] companies. Well, I had my challenge
[71:29] which was I have to raise these
[71:31] children. I have to educate
[71:33] them and I need something that's going
[71:35] to perform and that really uh I was
[71:40] already involved in Bitcoin but it
[71:42] forced me to focus and study even
[71:45] harder. What I've learned since then
[71:48] from them is uh you know more recently
[71:52] what sponges they are. The the the most
[71:54] interesting one was when the
[71:57] three-year-old learned about pi because
[72:00] he saw it on the calculator and he
[72:02] wanted to know more and he wanted to
[72:04] write it. And so I've started teaching
[72:08] him the Greek letters and he's just
[72:09] absorbing them like a sponge. So he can
[72:12] now read alpha, beta, gamma, delta,
[72:15] epsilon, lambda, mu, pi, fi,
[72:20] omega. And it's just uh incredible that
[72:24] he's a has the interest in b able to do
[72:27] that. And so I it's just um an example
[72:33] of how, you know, my kids are teaching
[72:37] me about how quickly they can learn and
[72:40] what they're interested in. I love that.
[72:44] How how old are they? Uh the older one
[72:48] just turned eight and then this one is
[72:50] is three. He'll be four fairly soon.
[72:53] Amazing. I love it. I I played with kids
[72:56] a lot uh yesterday when family
[72:59] gatherings, but uh I'm I'm I still don't
[73:02] have my
[73:04] own. Uh really cool. We have uh an
[73:07] endine as you know where the previous
[73:09] guest is asking a question for the next
[73:10] guest without knowing who the next guest
[73:12] actually is and the previous guest asks
[73:14] you an interesting question. Do you
[73:17] think that Bitcoin is private enough?
[73:20] And if not, will it become more private?
[73:25] Yeah, I I think I think it will become a
[73:28] little more private. Um but I think to
[73:31] get maximum privacy
[73:33] probably will involve trusted
[73:37] custodians. Um the the solutions may
[73:41] come from
[73:42] that.
[73:44] Um it's it's private enough if you're
[73:48] careful
[73:49] enough. And so the onus is on us to be
[73:52] careful. And that can be careful with
[73:56] your hardware wallet and the way you
[74:00] back that up and the way you manage with
[74:02] that or that can be careful enough to
[74:05] find custodians or you know multi-IG
[74:09] solutions that that you truly trust.
[74:13] uh as far as the change in
[74:17] privacy for the Bitcoin core that you
[74:20] know the biggest challenge will will be
[74:23] when it comes from quantum computing for
[74:25] the
[74:26] wallets that's probably 5 to 10 years
[74:29] off with Shor's algorithm and there
[74:32] already proposals to defend against that
[74:35] but there will be a transition and and
[74:37] people will have to work through that.
[74:41] Yeah, that's there's a lot of
[74:42] interesting things coming to Bitcoin, I
[74:44] think. Um, and it won't be boring for
[74:47] the next 5 to 10 years is is my personal
[74:50] prediction. That's why I'll have a
[74:51] podcast around the topic. Um, thank you
[74:54] so much, uh, Stephen. Um, before I let
[74:56] you go, where can people find you and
[74:58] ask you questions if they and I
[75:00] definitely know, uh, there will be
[75:02] people with questions. Sure. Uh well on
[75:05] this last slide that's showing uh
[75:07] there's my Twixster ex Twitter handle
[75:11] money or debt and then Substack is where
[75:14] I put most of my
[75:16] articles. So uh my namesubstack I love
[75:23] really cool. Uh thank you so much
[75:24] Stephen uh for for for coming on the
[75:27] show. Also your your Twitter Twixster
[75:30] will be on or in the description. So
[75:32] people can just click on that and
[75:34] directly come to your profile. So thank
[75:35] you so much for taking the time and also
[75:37] thank you so much for everyone that is
[75:39] watching and listening for joining us
[75:41] today. As always I'll be back tomorrow
[75:43] with another episode. Bye-bye.
