[00:00] I don't think there is anything that can
[00:02] stop Bitcoin before Bitcoin there were
[00:04] no such thing comparable to it this is
[00:07] the first digital coin that's absolutely
[00:09] secure and cannot be copied I'm glad
[00:12] that Bitcoin exists and I'm glad that
[00:14] about all the projects in the ecosystem
[00:16] yeah they're getting more and more
[00:17] especially since since Co I think there
[00:20] was almost an explosions of of new
[00:22] projects and new providers and new
[00:24] companies in the ecosystem that's
[00:26] Bitcoin need Po wol and absolutely not
[00:28] no crazy idea is of the Anything Can
[00:30] Happen Bitcoin will change society to be
[00:34] more
[00:35] [Music]
[00:39] fair I'm working for cinity since
[00:44] 2022 uh with my company before that uh
[00:48] we we did a project together there I
[00:50] founded a company it was a spin-off of
[00:52] an Austrian uh company from a so-called
[00:55] blockchain lab and we wanted to bring
[00:58] Bitcoin to the gambling
[01:01] industry and therefore in the initial
[01:04] phase we looked for a partner and that
[01:06] was confinity at the time uh but
[01:09] afterwards we founded a Bitcoin broker
[01:11] in
[01:12] lonstein interesting but you so
[01:15] confinity was founded in 2014 by Max
[01:18] ttin and the friend of
[01:20] him and yeah was the first broker in
[01:25] Austria I think even a month before bit
[01:27] Bund or after I don't know it was very
[01:30] in the same same time I'm responsible
[01:32] for the product development currently
[01:34] mainly the web portal our app and and
[01:36] all our products CEO still Max T we have
[01:41] another CEO co- CEO so to say Stefan
[01:45] Grill you also do ATM or is that how you
[01:48] started with confinity like you all you
[01:51] started as an
[01:52] exchange uh coinfinity started uh with
[01:55] an ATM
[01:57] actually um if I remember correctly I
[02:00] wasn't there at the time I only know the
[02:02] stories Max is telling um they had a ATM
[02:06] and an office basically and the people
[02:08] came by and they talked about Bitcoin
[02:10] and explained
[02:11] stuff and um later on uh there came the
[02:16] the the platform where you could buy and
[02:18] sell Bitcoin and the ATM business was
[02:22] split off into uh sub company also for
[02:26] regulatory reasons because handling with
[02:28] cash is also little bit different than
[02:31] with bank
[02:33] transfers I I don't even know what year
[02:35] this was but I think it was 2016 17 I
[02:38] don't know
[02:40] really it's super interesting uh I heard
[02:43] that Co Infinity you can even go to the
[02:46] office there uh locally in cards and you
[02:49] can buy Bitcoin like on a front desk uh
[02:52] from from a recent guest I heard that
[02:54] yeah absolutely we do have our front
[02:57] office um there are we just recently
[03:01] looked at the stats I think it was
[03:03] around thousand people visited our
[03:05] office and it's everything it's from
[03:08] people who just came by to use the ATM
[03:10] we have there it's people who basically
[03:13] never heard of Bitcoin and they want to
[03:16] buy it so there's there's a whole range
[03:19] here of of visitors we do have there
[03:21] also just sometimes for um we have some
[03:24] people coming by for a coffee talking
[03:25] about Bitcoin that's also okay I love
[03:28] that they coming back buying some
[03:30] Bitcoin and com for a coffee I love that
[03:33] um really cool one thing before we get
[03:35] into into the topic with with Bitcoin as
[03:37] money um I want to applaud coin Infinity
[03:40] to sticking with Bitcoin only uh as just
[03:43] said uh right right around the same time
[03:46] with um bit Bund they started and they
[03:49] did all the other coin also I'm I'm
[03:52] amazed actually how many Bitcoin only
[03:53] exchanges there are in in the German
[03:55] speaking area um and I got to know that
[03:59] it's not normal like there are a lot of
[04:01] regions in in in this world that uh have
[04:04] not as are not as good covered with
[04:06] Bitcoin only exchange as the the Bitcoin
[04:09] as the German speaking area
[04:11] unfortunately yeah
[04:13] unfortunately uh and I even asked my
[04:15] community which I was super surprised do
[04:18] you have any altcoins like you have
[04:21] Bitcoin but like do you have any
[04:22] altcoins uh next to that and uh around
[04:26] 45% I think like around 2,000 people
[04:29] voted on that and the
[04:30] 45% that watch my channel um have
[04:33] altcoins next to it like the the Bitcoin
[04:36] only thing is is even on a Bitcoin only
[04:38] Channel not that presented it's kind of
[04:41] fascinating to see yeah strange yeah but
[04:45] people like to gam yeah that's was
[04:47] actually the the the biggest uh comment
[04:49] that I replied that I got yeah like I I
[04:51] have Bitcoin but I also try to to get
[04:54] more Bitcoin with like 2% or 5% of my
[04:57] stack with altcoins which I'm like ah
[05:00] in invest that time to provide for the
[05:02] community and and try to G gain and
[05:05] therefore more a bigger bet Bitcoin
[05:07] stack in producing something a real
[05:10] world asset service something of of
[05:13] value and then getting paid in Bitcoin
[05:14] for that that's hope for me at least a
[05:18] better um invested time so now for the
[05:21] topic of like um Bitcoin as money you
[05:25] touched on it before we started
[05:27] recording uh that we have the
[05:29] institutions in and now people say like
[05:31] oh is it has it failed as money how do
[05:33] you see that um I think because I'm a a
[05:36] big Optimist um recently I heard the
[05:39] phrase Bitcoin failed as money um we all
[05:43] know about the the the functions money
[05:45] should have yeah and we are the one
[05:48] argument would be we are in the store of
[05:50] value phas
[05:52] still and on the other hand I would say
[05:55] there
[05:56] is maybe a small uh increase but I see a
[06:00] lot of merchants using uh lightning
[06:04] despite all the
[06:05] naysayers but it's still early um on the
[06:09] other hand I would say with starting
[06:12] with the ATF and um Michael sailor and
[06:15] all the crazy things he's doing right
[06:17] now and um to be honest the last thing I
[06:21] didn't quite understand what was going
[06:23] on therea so I'm wondering how long this
[06:26] will go
[06:27] on and uh um compared to the people who
[06:32] really would use sound money yeah in the
[06:36] developing lands uh when you don't have
[06:38] access to Banks and all the stuff we
[06:40] know it yeah so those are the the the
[06:42] two polls for me and I'm to be honest
[06:47] I'm not happy about Michael saor I'm
[06:48] also not happy about the ETFs yeah it's
[06:51] increasing the price fine but that's not
[06:54] the end goal here is it maybe like as
[06:56] you said like it's maybe it's just uh
[06:59] the the face the that we're currently in
[07:01] it's also super interesting because they
[07:05] are basically playing that fat game as
[07:10] and and trying to get as much money into
[07:13] their own um uh kind of wallets uh with
[07:17] that feat games and kind of pushing the
[07:20] Bitcoin adoption forward on a store
[07:23] value side but nothing for the medium
[07:25] exchange side which is is an interesting
[07:27] discussion do you see um that is a risk
[07:31] of like people forgetting that Bitcoin
[07:33] is actually money and they are seeing it
[07:35] only only as an asset I think yeah of
[07:38] course because if that's the narrative
[07:40] that is pushed yeah in the public I
[07:43] think that the people will will get used
[07:46] to it and don't think about the money
[07:48] part
[07:49] anymore that's the same discussion we
[07:51] already um always having about um self
[07:55] coding your coins or using a custodian
[08:00] um some people are not are not good with
[08:03] with new technologies yeah
[08:05] they so it would it would be better for
[08:09] them to use a custodial server service
[08:12] maybe yeah yeah it's really depending on
[08:14] on your use case and your own personal
[08:16] level and what you're planning to do I
[08:19] think it would be great yeah if
[08:20] everybody studies Bitcoin yeah
[08:23] and lives after the the let's call it
[08:26] the Bitcoin aics yeah but if we reach
[08:31] let me say when we reach a level where
[08:33] this is big enough obviously the the
[08:36] game theory is playing out we even see
[08:38] this at nation states now
[08:42] um from that aspect I don't think there
[08:44] is anything that can stop Bitcoin except
[08:48] we ourselves if the bitcoiners stop
[08:51] Bitcoin yeah and if Humanity doesn't if
[08:54] the pain to change our money system is
[08:57] not big enough yet that we get to switch
[08:59] to the whole man standard to
[09:01] bitcoin then basically Bitcoin will not
[09:05] go away it will always be there I think
[09:08] because there is a hardcore group that
[09:10] won't give up on it and that's awesome I
[09:12] think I'm I'm part of that
[09:14] too but how do we 50 51% attack our
[09:19] money system on on a worldwide scale
[09:22] yeah and how long does it take so maybe
[09:26] we won't get to this point in our life
[09:29] lifetime maybe it takes another two or
[09:31] three
[09:32] generations obviously we as bitcoiners
[09:35] would love to to see more change in a
[09:37] shorter time frame but I think the
[09:40] shorter the time frame there the more
[09:42] pain is
[09:43] involved if you think about um if you
[09:48] look at Austrian economics and the the
[09:50] the theories there if it would be
[09:53] possible to switch the whole world the
[09:57] the tennis like Snap I think the effects
[10:00] would not be good I think this has to be
[10:03] a slow process and it will take time and
[10:06] a lot of us won't see the the the end of
[10:10] Adria or at least
[10:11] the the bigger changes on the path of
[10:15] Bitcoin there's a big advantage of a
[10:18] slow dying of the feed system I always
[10:21] compare it with the Titanic if the
[10:23] Titanic sinks in in like half an hour um
[10:28] most people will TR really quickly
[10:30] because it's really cold out there uh
[10:32] and will not be able to get on the live
[10:35] boats because the life boats also need
[10:37] kind of time to get there um we we I
[10:42] don't know if Bitcoin
[10:44] would like it would be it's an
[10:46] interesting thought experiment like what
[10:48] what if the the Fe system actually
[10:51] crashes tomorrow completely and 8
[10:54] billion people now have to use Bitcoin
[10:56] and lightning and all the infrastructure
[10:58] that is right now there there's probably
[11:01] also a lot of technical issues that we
[11:02] run into if it's go if it goes like
[11:05] really quickly probably not even
[11:07] possible uh or like with a lot of
[11:09] growing pains in the next few months um
[11:12] so I think it's good if we if the Fiat
[11:16] system dies out slowly but I I I I see
[11:19] the Fiat system dying out quickly for
[11:21] some reason it's like and you see all
[11:23] the things going on um with inflation
[11:27] with government spending you're like how
[11:29] can this go on for another 20 years like
[11:32] it's hard to imagine that being on for
[11:35] it's already hard to imagine that it's
[11:37] it's been 50 years uh since since the US
[11:40] dollar basically existed Euro a little
[11:42] bit um less I think like 20 or 30 years
[11:45] what the euro is now there uh and and
[11:48] it's BD valued like 90 80 95% depending
[11:52] on what metrics you're using so it's
[11:54] already kind of dead but we still using
[11:57] it and people still think it's safe and
[11:59] it's still a great great money uh which
[12:02] is kind of shocking for me
[12:05] honestly absolutely I'm right there with
[12:07] you I think it was about 15 14 yeah when
[12:11] I read the first book of
[12:13] hike it was because of my mother because
[12:15] he was a teacher and we had a lot of
[12:16] books at home U not that I get it at the
[12:19] time but I knew that there was something
[12:22] off with the system right back
[12:24] then I I remember a story my mother told
[12:27] me I was a little boy about 910 or
[12:30] whatever and um where we lived right on
[12:33] the other side there was a shop um and
[12:36] there was a from my point of view a
[12:39] homeless person always going through the
[12:41] trash behind the shop then
[12:43] and I was wondering and asking the
[12:46] question why does he have to do that now
[12:49] explain to a little child why this is
[12:51] necessary and what all the stuff that is
[12:53] going on in the world it's quite a
[12:55] complex uh thing but when you when don't
[12:59] get started about taxes but when you
[13:01] talk about inflation why do we need it I
[13:04] never heard a clear answer on that why
[13:05] it would be necessary and I say I it's
[13:08] basically theft or hid text let's say it
[13:13] that way and I think it's a little bit
[13:15] because of laziness and because of
[13:17] Education or educational
[13:20] system I don't I really don't remember
[13:23] learning anything about economics in
[13:25] school at the University especially
[13:28] about Austrian EC economics there were
[13:30] only a few people um thinking about this
[13:34] and and talking about
[13:37] this that's one thing that Bitcoin
[13:39] brought for me it brought back Austrian
[13:41] economics which I find quite cool also
[13:44] because I see a lot of young people
[13:46] reading books again I think it's a a
[13:49] major Game Changer and you know I think
[13:52] it's a little bit like uh yeah where
[13:54] does the money come from come from the
[13:56] cash machine where does the water come
[13:58] from oh yeah let's go up
[14:01] Tuck and who knows how a car exactly
[14:04] does work yeah so a lot of people don't
[14:08] know about don't know a lot about their
[14:10] surroundings and what's happening in the
[14:13] world and a lot of people also don't
[14:15] care that's that's also fine yeah me
[14:18] it's a free market and also some people
[14:21] don't have access to education they
[14:23] don't have access to all the amenities
[14:26] we have in the Western World here so
[14:29] there's a great split and a lot of
[14:31] reasons here why people don't get it and
[14:34] the question I think is how can we speed
[14:38] up this process yeah and spread the
[14:43] word I'm sometimes wondering if we are
[14:46] kind of on
[14:49] on like a lot of people uh let's stick
[14:52] with your example of the car a lot of
[14:54] people like very few people really know
[14:57] how a car works from the inside out and
[15:00] the the engine and everything with the
[15:02] electronics going on um but most people
[15:05] kind of know how to drive at least those
[15:07] who have a driver license and use the
[15:09] cars um which then also goes back to
[15:13] let's say WhatsApp like most people have
[15:16] no clue what's going on behind the
[15:17] scenes when you send a message they just
[15:19] know if like there's those two ticks uh
[15:21] it's sent from you and the other one
[15:23] received it and if it's blue and you
[15:25] activate he even read it but they can
[15:29] explain what's the network behind those
[15:33] things and the TCP protocol and all the
[15:35] things that go behind the scenes um
[15:38] which to a certain extent obviously it's
[15:40] it's fine because not everyone can know
[15:41] everything um that's kind of basics of
[15:44] how we humans uh uh divide labor um but
[15:49] if it comes to money and you have no
[15:50] clue what you're actually holding and
[15:53] financial energy is such an important
[15:54] part of of your being you should know
[16:00] what makes good money and what are the
[16:01] foundations of good money and you don't
[16:03] have to be a programmer to understand
[16:06] Bitcoin you can be uh you you you can
[16:09] just know the fundamental of of of of um
[16:13] economics which then leads me now to the
[16:15] question of like are we fighting a
[16:18] battle that we cannot win if we try to
[16:21] Orange Peel people towards self-
[16:23] custodial uh and all those things um and
[16:28] will like being Bitcoin Banks and being
[16:31] people that uh take custody of your
[16:34] Bitcoin be like a very convenient normal
[16:36] way to do it or is it the other way
[16:38] around where it's now like a a password
[16:42] on a username and everyone will have
[16:44] their own keys I'm still confused of
[16:47] like are we are we achieving the self-
[16:50] custody uh uh way of the of people are
[16:53] taking self- sovereignty of their own
[16:55] money or are we ending up with a lot of
[16:58] bitco Banks and Bitcoin institutions
[17:01] that then take uh take care of your
[17:04] Bitcoin and there's only a small
[17:05] hardcore group that is like oh no it's
[17:07] my money uh they might even be a
[17:10] liquidity or like a a money provider for
[17:14] other people that don't want to do that
[17:15] and act as like a private bank even um
[17:18] there's some what do you think about
[17:20] that I think it will be a mix
[17:23] here
[17:25] um especially regarding the Bitcoin
[17:27] Banks I think
[17:29] this will happen for sure especially for
[17:33] for companies maybe for institutions who
[17:35] don't want to hold their own Keys yeah
[17:38] maybe there's also an an insurance for
[17:41] it there are some things that make life
[17:44] definit definitively easier um and I
[17:49] think it depends on your on your own
[17:51] risk appetite
[17:54] yeah and regarding the banks I mean it
[17:57] would be
[17:59] back to business for banks yeah like in
[18:01] a good old times um the the follow-up
[18:05] question would be what about paper
[18:06] Bitcoin yeah if the banks hold all the
[18:10] coins who's going to stop them from
[18:12] tinkering with the books like it
[18:15] happened with go there on multiple
[18:18] occas and so zo go ahead uh no that was
[18:23] basically yeah there there are so many
[18:25] factors to it and I think um as we
[18:28] talked in beginning
[18:29] this is a very slow process yeah um
[18:34] and we are still very early in the
[18:38] beginning of this process absolutely
[18:40] yeah when before Bitcoin there were no
[18:43] such thing comparable to it this is the
[18:46] first digital
[18:48] coin that's absolutely
[18:51] secure and cannot be copied so I
[18:55] think if you take the the internet for
[18:59] example um I think I'm I'm part of quite
[19:03] a a special generation here uh because I
[19:07] grew up before the internet um then um
[19:11] my father was was working for for a
[19:13] provider and so we had BX at home yeah I
[19:16] think I had the the the first phone or
[19:19] one of the first we had in Austria also
[19:22] the first internet
[19:24] access and so I basically when I was I
[19:28] don't know um back I don't know 1 14 at
[19:31] the time um I was quite fascinated
[19:35] fascinated by it I early on uh was drawn
[19:39] to the to the demo scene yeah hacking
[19:41] and cracking stuff and always tinkering
[19:44] around
[19:46] and uh looking for ways why does this
[19:49] work as it works and especially with
[19:53] computers of course I got a soft I
[19:56] became a software developer so
[20:00] that's and as you said before sure you
[20:03] don't have to know it yeah and most of
[20:05] the people also shouldn't have to know
[20:07] it so that's that's the one the one
[20:09] point I would
[20:10] make and
[20:13] yeah still early I guess so and a lot to
[20:16] do for us we we have a lot to do like we
[20:20] a lot of things to develop as a soft
[20:23] engine is there anything that you uh
[20:25] would change on bitcoin or maybe on the
[20:27] ecosystem of of of Bitcoin kind of a
[20:30] thing that is is missing for you right
[20:32] now um I think there
[20:34] are two major things one is the user
[20:39] experience and the
[20:41] usability um it got very much better the
[20:45] last years if I think back of 2018 2019
[20:50] our first experiment with lightning at
[20:53] that time you had to be a developer yet
[20:55] to understand what you are doing there
[20:57] so that got a lot easy
[20:59] um but if you compare it to commercial
[21:02] products or even I hate to say it to
[21:05] some crypto and shitcoin stuff they do
[21:08] have a better UI sometimes yeah and it's
[21:12] people are using it and they don't even
[21:13] think about it if it's crypto yeah and I
[21:16] think with Bitcoin we have to get to
[21:18] this point too and I I think we will get
[21:21] to this point it's just a matter of
[21:24] time and as I said because of I'm
[21:27] optimist
[21:29] I think um this is all um yeah
[21:33] complaining on on a very high level yeah
[21:35] because basically I'm glad that Bitcoin
[21:37] exists yeah and I'm glad that about all
[21:39] the projects in the ecosystem yeah
[21:41] they're getting more and more especially
[21:43] since since covid I think there was yeah
[21:47] almost an explosions of of new projects
[21:49] and new providers and new companies in
[21:51] the ecosystem and that's quite quite a
[21:54] cool thing I
[21:56] think I are you still surprised by um by
[21:59] how how quickly we are kind of moving
[22:01] into this institutionalizing of of of
[22:03] the Bitcoin with presidents talking
[22:06] about it so many companies talking about
[22:08] it and and countries even like Budan uh
[22:12] puts a huge amount of the purchasing
[22:14] power to bitcoin I mean Salvador is also
[22:16] great uh but if you compare the
[22:18] relations of how many Bitcoins buan has
[22:21] and how big it is I think it's like half
[22:23] the population of Vienna and Vienna is
[22:26] small and and Austria is small and bu is
[22:28] a whole country um are you sometimes
[22:32] kind of shocked how quickly this goes
[22:35] especially if you're like longer term in
[22:37] in Bitcoin and you're seeing how how far
[22:39] it already came um it was not surprising
[22:43] but I think Co was uh
[22:45] surely uh increased this this whole
[22:48] things here especially with with Michael
[22:52] saor in the beginning so he popped
[22:54] basically up of nowhere and became the
[22:57] yeah what what did the po it's the the
[22:59] Bitcoin Alchemist yes I saw this I I
[23:01] don't even know what the word means I'm
[23:03] not that good in English
[23:06] Alchemist it's the same as in German
[23:08] yeah you know oh I also don't know in
[23:10] German what does it
[23:12] mean oh those where the people uh the
[23:16] let's call it the chemics of of the
[23:18] Early
[23:20] times oh okay
[23:23] interesting The Alchemist yeah I I saw
[23:26] that saw it and I was like that that
[23:28] looks
[23:29] interesting uh the the Bitcoin Alchemist
[23:31] but I think they are the first one to
[23:33] call him like that I think nobody no
[23:35] nobody else except
[23:37] Forbes calls him that way I think in the
[23:40] early days he he got the Giga chat uh
[23:43] description a lot uh and and now he's
[23:47] like just like go going so hard on but
[23:50] I'm like I'm not clever enough to
[23:53] understand what uh what he's doing on
[23:55] the convertible notes and how he's able
[23:58] to raise like 42 billion do and buy
[24:00] Bitcoin with that like um I had some
[24:04] people on the podcast explaining me that
[24:06] and I'm still not fully understanding
[24:08] what this really means and how does this
[24:10] work uh it's it's like either it's an a
[24:14] money glitch that he found and he's kind
[24:16] of destroying the Fiat system with and
[24:19] and sucking a lot of financial energy
[24:21] from the Fiat system directly to
[24:23] bitcoin uh or there's something going
[24:27] wrong and it it it will kind of collapse
[24:30] at some point I don't know like I'm I'm
[24:32] just not intelligent enough or not not
[24:34] informed enough to to to judge what micr
[24:38] strategy is doing uh do do you have an
[24:41] opinion on
[24:42] that yeah I think um especially with the
[24:46] last one Al just stuff I heard from
[24:50] somebody else who might have understood
[24:52] it um I think it's a glitch yeah he
[24:55] found the glitch he's connecting
[24:56] different um invest groups they didn't
[24:59] have access before in that way and there
[25:02] is a lot of mon a lot of money in the
[25:05] financial
[25:06] market and you know your more complex of
[25:09] financial product gets we know what
[25:10] happened in the past with this yeah but
[25:12] let's see how this play
[25:14] out I mean if uh if if micro strategy is
[25:17] successful with all the strategies that
[25:19] they are currently doing and they're not
[25:21] blowing up which I'm I'm I'm fairly
[25:24] fairly sure about that actually uh but
[25:28] um maybe maybe I'm wrong I about that
[25:30] then this will be a story like uh we had
[25:34] in 2008 how the fils called the big the
[25:38] the banking crash movies The Big Short
[25:40] yeah exactly uh I think there will be
[25:43] like if if if he catapults his company
[25:47] which had what was in the beginning like
[25:49] a $400 million balance sheet to now
[25:51] they're raising 42 billion like I I I
[25:55] those scales is just like I I have no
[25:57] clue how he he got there but he's a uh
[26:01] um a fat game genius that uses those fat
[26:05] games to maximize his own uh and micro
[26:07] strategies Bitcoin Holdings and maybe
[26:10] found a money clitch which is super
[26:11] interesting how how do you look at um
[26:14] the regulations and all the things that
[26:16] going on in Europe I think we are
[26:18] spending a lot of time to talk about
[26:19] what's going on in America uh and and
[26:22] and you're now working in a company in
[26:24] Austria and Europe um how do you look at
[26:27] what's going on in Europe uh with
[26:29] regulations with of Bitcoin adoption and
[26:32] all the things I mean in general I'm not
[26:34] a friend of
[26:36] regulations um and the same thing it's
[26:39] also with the with the upcoming
[26:41] MAA um I mean as as a Bitcoin only
[26:44] broker it didn't hit as full as some
[26:50] other
[26:51] exchanges for example the dting of USD
[26:54] that was
[26:56] happening and it's a lot of work here
[26:59] not only from a technical point of view
[27:01] also from the administrative side there
[27:03] are lots of documents to fill out the
[27:06] yeah you're producing paper and
[27:09] words and sometimes I'm wondering if
[27:11] this is really for the benefit of the
[27:14] consumers or does this make anything
[27:16] safer I mean especially in in crypto if
[27:19] you look around there are so many
[27:22] scams yeah it's the other side the other
[27:25] side of the metal
[27:29] for now we can't change it so we have to
[27:31] live with it as a license company here
[27:35] obviously we currently working on the
[27:37] Mika to get it so it's
[27:40] basically yeah we have to do it
[27:43] unfortunately I partnered up with coin
[27:47] vigilante this is the most beautiful

[29:58] it's kind of an interesting situation we
[30:00] have a lot of Regulation but all those
[30:02] crypto scams you can still buy on all
[30:04] the exchanges in Europe where I'm like
[30:06] okay you make it harder for uh the
[30:09] Bitcoin only crowd and the actual scams
[30:11] are still going on it's it's I don't
[30:13] know it I also kind of question the
[30:16] efficiency of those regulations but I
[30:20] guess that's the European uh unions
[30:22] things of regulating things that are
[30:25] going to be developed in America and and
[30:27] China
[30:28] that's like the meme I always have in
[30:30] the front in in front of my mind do do
[30:33] you think we we have to get more
[30:34] politically in involved as as bitcoiners
[30:37] like bitcoiners are usually like getting
[30:39] away from Poli and like I don't want to
[30:41] do to do any have to do anything with
[30:43] the state but um maybe we have the
[30:46] responsibility to kind of get more
[30:48] active and influence things on a
[30:50] political level yeah I
[30:53] mean Nico asked me that when I was at
[30:55] his B I think it was 22
[30:58] and back then um I was really thinking
[31:01] about starting a Bitcoin party in
[31:03] Austria but um yeah when you when you
[31:07] start digging into this
[31:09] topic and you are not made to be a
[31:14] politician no no no thank
[31:18] you that's Bitcoin need buing wol
[31:20] absolutely not yeah bitco will go it
[31:23] way um but when like America when nation
[31:29] states start building up strategic
[31:32] Bitcoin reserves I wouldn't be the last
[31:35] one or that I don't want to be I
[31:37] wouldn't want to be the last one yeah as
[31:38] a state Al because we just recently
[31:42] heard of the Czech um National Bank and
[31:47] the answer of of the ISB and the
[31:50] lagat I mean and it's basically with
[31:54] with with every topic like this if you
[31:56] look for example at the AI act and how
[31:59] many AI companies do we have in Europe
[32:01] yeah and it's a little bit like the.
[32:06] bub um and how many big players do we
[32:12] have in Europe like in the likes like a
[32:14] Google meta Microsoft or anything yeah I
[32:18] think the only
[32:19] one I can only call one I think
[32:22] Spotify was one of the bigger
[32:25] players I don't okay bat buner
[32:29] but there are a lot of hidden Champions
[32:31] yeah and and also before Bitcoin I was
[32:34] in the i i i founded four companies uh
[32:39] Al together and that was about 10 years
[32:42] I was working for for uh for a big
[32:45] company and for 10 years I was in a
[32:46] startup scene and I see a lot of
[32:50] similarities here in the regarding the
[32:54] groups and entrepr entrepreneurs and
[32:57] people who who build stuff yeah um there
[33:01] is a little bit of of of overlap yeah
[33:04] because I think um if you get into
[33:06] Bitcoin that's the same drive that you
[33:08] have as a startup founder yeah you want
[33:11] to change something yeah and you want to
[33:12] change something you want to uh build
[33:15] new tools you want to use tools that are
[33:19] actually there and combine it in some
[33:21] other way yeah and you want to drive
[33:23] something forward yeah that's an a it's
[33:25] an inner an inner thing yeah you and not
[33:29] a lot of people do have this yeah or do
[33:32] have the chance yeah to to take this
[33:35] this
[33:36] on absolutely and I also saw what lagard
[33:41] says like I just want to play that
[33:43] really quickly because it's like just a
[33:45] I think 30 seconds or 60 seconds or
[33:48] something like that long uh for for
[33:50] people to to see that it's it's quite
[33:53] fascinating and I think it's it's it's
[33:56] what represents in in the U uh with in
[34:01] regards regulation um yeah I just SW to
[34:05] that because let's first listen to that
[34:07] I hope you can you all can hear that
[34:09] let's see if my technical skills are
[34:11] working out
[34:13] now on this uh matter that you referred
[34:15] to and whether reserves of Central Bank
[34:20] um should or could include Bitcoins I
[34:23] think there's a view around the table of
[34:26] the governing Council and most likely
[34:28] the general Council as well that
[34:31] reserves have to be liquid that reserves
[34:34] have to be secure that they have to be
[34:36] safe that they should not be plugged by
[34:39] the suspicion of money laundering or
[34:41] other criminal activities and as a
[34:44] result I'm confident uh that reserves
[34:50] will not enter I mean that's that's she
[34:53] smiles when she says that yeah she
[34:56] smiles it's it's so fun it's it's like
[34:59] literally liquid safe and secure it's
[35:03] like what are your first thoughts when
[35:05] you hear this when I first heard it say
[35:07] liquid secure
[35:09] safe I thought the next word would be
[35:11] okay let's talk about Bitcoin no I mean
[35:14] it's crazy yeah because what what year
[35:16] do we have yeah money laundering the
[35:18] most money was laundered using the
[35:20] dollar yeah that's fact absolutely and
[35:23] also um the the this Criminal connection
[35:28] to bitcoin kind of dies out a little bit
[35:30] and I almost feel like the new narrative
[35:33] and I hear it from from some sides is
[35:35] now it's unfair that the early
[35:38] bitcoiners have so much Bitcoin and so
[35:41] we we have to tax the head out of
[35:42] Bitcoin so the early bitcoiners don't
[35:44] have that big advantage that seems to be
[35:46] kind of the the new narrative they
[35:48] they're trying to push at least that's
[35:50] what what I hear from from from those
[35:53] people so that's the the successor to
[35:56] we're going to boil all the water and
[35:58] use up all the energy so it's bad for
[36:01] the
[36:02] environment so now they're even more
[36:05] more studies so the the usage of
[36:08] renewable energy is is rising so of
[36:11] course you can't use that as an argument
[36:13] anymore and you need something else and
[36:16] yeah me there two topics they're always
[36:17] good and for
[36:20] for mongering and for for striving for
[36:25] more um
[36:28] less Freedom yeah and that's terrorism
[36:31] and if child are wol
[36:34] yeah the same as the the what was it
[36:38] called the surveillance act where all
[36:41] Messengers should scan everything that's
[36:43] inside if there is anything illegal
[36:45] included there that's
[36:49] crazy yeah I think the digital Service
[36:52] Act was that the official name yeah it's
[36:56] it's definitely but also have some hope
[36:59] to be honest and and maybe you can you
[37:02] can tell me if if you also see that I
[37:04] see with the EU elections and with
[37:06] what's going on in Europe currently that
[37:08] the parties that are more critical
[37:11] towards uh the EU and also with that the
[37:15] ECP with that the digital service act
[37:18] with that all the things are kind of
[37:19] getting stronger all over Europe it's
[37:21] not just Austria it's like all of the
[37:23] the European countries so I I do feel
[37:27] like
[37:28] uh there there might be more and more
[37:31] people that say like we we don't want
[37:34] this amazing meme of like America is
[37:37] doing jbd uh China is doing deeps and
[37:40] European is kind of forbidding that the
[37:43] the what bottle is is going off I I have
[37:47] mostly American listeners I think I have
[37:49] to search for a picture to to show them
[37:51] what what crazy things we're doing here
[37:53] in Europe but like that's kind of like
[37:56] where where I Europe do do you feel that
[37:59] that this this little hope that the the
[38:01] the the political forces that are
[38:03] against um the EU is kind of getting
[38:07] stronger as a symbol of people are
[38:09] waking up or people are seeing what the
[38:11] EU is doing and also kind of judging it
[38:14] as as a bad theme yeah that that
[38:17] absolutely um there was a a growing
[38:21] growing that's that's growing since
[38:23] since all the co stuff stuff that
[38:25] happened yeah it's not only against
[38:28] the EU also against media and other
[38:32] stuff I think for some or many people
[38:35] this was quite a wakeup moment there
[38:39] and I mean it's there are always two
[38:43] sides and I think the the the whole
[38:45] thing also Society similar to bitcoin
[38:49] Works in Cycles here that that's ever
[38:52] evolving thing and I mean compared to
[38:56] the you I think in America the whole
[38:59] what they call the the vog factor was
[39:02] way bigger than here in Europe uh and
[39:06] the same it's SW to the other side I
[39:08] think it's now on on the way to swing
[39:11] back and that's the yeah that's going on
[39:15] for some time because we as a human
[39:18] species we are not able to to stay on
[39:20] the the middle pass I actually found it
[39:23] uh that's that's that's the amazing meme
[39:25] that's going on it's kind of it's kind
[39:27] of
[39:27] hilarious and and uh for for those uh
[39:31] from America or from Canada that that
[39:34] don't know what we doing with those
[39:36] bottles um it's now a law that those
[39:40] bottle um how they called bottle closes
[39:44] bottle neck whatever um they're not
[39:48] allowed to fall off the bottle in order
[39:51] to save our
[39:56] planet that basic that's basically it uh
[39:59] but yeah let's let's let's come back to
[40:01] uh like Bitcoin and uh what Bitcoin is
[40:04] doing for positive in the world let's
[40:07] focus
[40:08] on good things um how did Bitcoin
[40:12] influence your life and what did Bitcoin
[40:14] do for for you um the TDR would be
[40:18] Bitcoin fix
[40:20] me no um back then I was working or I
[40:25] founded a company and um I was right
[40:28] inside the burnout
[40:31] and
[40:32] um Bitcoin gave me some Focus I had over
[40:36] the years I had multiple touch points
[40:38] with Bitcoin I think like like many
[40:40] people did and the first few where H no
[40:44] this cannot work that's like the Linton
[40:46] dollar
[40:47] or it's all have been DED
[40:50] already uh eash nothing worked
[40:54] out and then came Bitcoin and and the
[40:58] the major the major ah effect I had was
[41:03] when I got over profer work and when I
[41:06] when I understood how it really
[41:10] worked and as I said because I'm a very
[41:13] big Optimist I think it will take some
[41:15] time but we we're going to get
[41:18] there
[41:19] and the the fixing part was because I
[41:23] had a new topic where I could Dive In
[41:27] and I think it it was basically like
[41:30] like Andreas antopo said it there hours
[41:32] and hours a day uh reading watching
[41:36] antonoplos videos diving into the topic
[41:40] um looking at the source code yeah
[41:43] building uh a Bitcoin as a project
[41:46] looking at the consensus algorithm um
[41:48] trying to find
[41:50] anything um inside the code where I
[41:53] could say ah this cannot work and I'm
[41:56] still trying to find an era in Bitcoin
[41:58] yeah but until until now I didn't yeah
[42:02] so that's a good thing and also the the
[42:05] other topics is it brought back for me
[42:08] so because of I was working very lot
[42:11] there I didn't have time to read or I
[42:14] disregarded my own hobbies and so now or
[42:19] at least back then U Bitcoin became a
[42:21] new hobby and with it all the topics
[42:24] that that evolve around here also aide
[42:26] that technology uh economics philos
[42:29] philosophy and and everything you can
[42:31] you can find it in the in there for
[42:33] yourself so Bitcoin kind of brought back
[42:36] uh the Life part of of of your of your
[42:39] human
[42:40] being yeah so to say it showed me that
[42:43] there are other things aside work too
[42:45] yeah and it also allows you to do that
[42:48] if you save in Bitcoin uh you have the
[42:50] financial reward in there you you save
[42:53] in a monetary system that all of the
[42:55] sudden rewards uh
[42:58] being hardworking being disciplined
[43:01] being uh being good because then all of
[43:04] the sudden you are building this
[43:06] financial um buffer for yourself where
[43:09] you can allow yourself to take all the
[43:11] good decisions if you are always on zero
[43:13] money uh and and you're struggling to
[43:16] pay bills obviously you don't have a lot
[43:18] of time to research about diet and
[43:21] health and uh what money is actually you
[43:25] should do this still but but uh it's not
[43:28] as easy as you would have then with
[43:30] Bitcoin when you do a when you do
[43:32] something and you can accumulate
[43:33] something you get that hope back that's
[43:35] why I think it's it's brilliant that
[43:37] hope.com is linking to bitcoin uh that
[43:40] we have that kind of like uh vision of
[43:43] oh yeah if if I save that amount it's
[43:46] it's accumulating and it it gives me
[43:49] some security and I'm not depending on
[43:52] uh a job or like a state or anything
[43:55] else it it makes you more selfs I I see
[43:59] that as the the biggest change what what
[44:01] happened my podcast started out as not
[44:03] at the Robin S podcast it started out at
[44:05] the Bitcoin path and the first few
[44:07] episodes I always asked like oh how did
[44:09] Bitcoin change you this was kind of the
[44:11] direction what my PA was what my podcast
[44:15] was about in the beginning it got
[44:17] boring fast because it was a lot of the
[44:20] same stories uh that's why I changed the
[44:22] strategy a little bit but it's super
[44:24] fascinating How uh
[44:27] um a technology tool that is used as
[44:31] money or is money um changes people's
[44:34] lives with diet and sports it's kind of
[44:36] fascinating to to see that uh going on
[44:41] uh how how was it for you to to discover
[44:43] Bitcoin uh that in the in the early
[44:45] phase where there were no
[44:48] Bitcoin uh exchanges that make it super
[44:51] easy the a lot of Hardware wallets a lot
[44:53] of services and and uh a lot of
[44:56] Technology is around it where you had to
[44:59] figure out a lot of the stuff yourself
[45:01] and probably also made a lot of mistakes
[45:03] along the way yeah one time I tried to
[45:06] to buy Bitcoin and I think it was on
[45:08] yeah it was on
[45:09] monox and I didn't in the end it was
[45:13] quite a mistake I still B my own ass for
[45:16] this but it looked spooky it looked
[45:18] scammy and I don't know yeah and then I
[45:22] think it was a few month a half a year
[45:24] before mon Cox what hacked so that was
[45:28] the confirmation ha I knew them it's
[45:31] that's not going to work out but the
[45:33] tools got better yeah and I think the
[45:36] the idea is basically too good to go
[45:39] away yeah and if if you get Bitcoin I
[45:44] mean nobody gets Bitcoin uh totally yeah
[45:48] but if you understood the basic
[45:51] principles then everything else
[45:55] is gone yeah
[45:58] because this is this is such an eye
[46:00] opener yeah can give yourself a faceb
[46:02] saying oh my why didn't I think about it
[46:04] yeah and as you said before yeah the
[46:07] main question what is money why do we
[46:09] need money as a society I mean that's
[46:12] also quite an interesting topic uh for
[46:15] me as an old Star Trek fan I'm a
[46:18] Trey um and thinking about all the stuff
[46:21] going on with uh Robotics and addal uh
[46:24] artificial
[46:25] intelligence and and do we reach a point
[46:29] where there is no need for anyone to
[46:31] work anymore because we do we Harvest so
[46:34] much energy that we do have and
[46:36] replicator for food for luxury items
[46:38] everything you want to need what what
[46:40] car items are left yeah I mean that's
[46:43] obviously land yeah
[46:45] but if El brings us to mass not even
[46:50] that and um there are some some some
[46:54] books on the topic of uh money l so iety
[46:58] that's always an idea that I find quite
[47:00] fascinating
[47:02] but oh not but maybe I think Bitcoin
[47:06] could be the tool to get us there maybe
[47:08] maybe not I don't know that's quite some
[47:11] some part science fiction yeah we will
[47:13] see it when we get there but I think
[47:15] it's also an interesting uh thought to
[47:18] think about how could a society look
[47:21] without any money what is the value and
[47:23] our our value that we exchange with
[47:26] money
[47:27] and what must the circumstances be that
[47:30] we don't need it anymore I mean if we
[47:33] live in in such a big abundance and uh I
[47:38] think there will always be money I think
[47:41] there will always be kind of a scoring
[47:43] system uh but the I talked with Luke PR
[47:49] around that topic is super fascinating
[47:51] when you look back in history the the
[47:54] poorest like the a a a middle um like
[48:00] someone that is now in the middle range
[48:02] of wealth uh is doing so much better and
[48:06] can do so much more than the Weist
[48:08] person for like 100 or 200 years ago
[48:11] when you think about uh um most of
[48:14] people that are listening here could put
[48:18] could buy plane tickets tomorrow to
[48:21] another country and fly there get food
[48:24] served there uh and can phone with
[48:27] someone on the other side of the planet
[48:29] send money
[48:30] around like all those things are like
[48:33] science fictions like 100 years ago uh
[48:36] and not even the richest person alive
[48:38] could do that so like we we're coming to
[48:39] the point I think where um the the the
[48:43] lowest class still can live quite nicely
[48:48] um and we're
[48:49] seeing we're seeing the the beginnings
[48:51] of that we're not there yet like we have
[48:53] so much problems in the world that we
[48:55] are not even close to there
[48:57] but small examples like okay that's
[49:00] maybe a stupid example but it's on top
[49:01] of my mind because it came today uh we
[49:04] got a robot vacuum cleaner
[49:06] today and uh it's quite a task of like
[49:10] every week going around and doing all
[49:13] the corners and stuff like that and then
[49:15] just being able to press a button and do
[49:19] something that you enjoy you can watch
[49:21] TV you can work on an art project you
[49:24] can paint the painting you can uh write
[49:26] a book in that time uh where you
[49:29] otherwise would have uh vacuumed your
[49:32] floor that is amazing and then if you
[49:36] see what Tesla and Google is doing with
[49:39] self-driving I tested the newest Tesla
[49:41] in December in Miami and this was
[49:44] driving me one hour around Miami in city
[49:48] on the highway everywhere and I didn't
[49:50] even touch this wheel it was spooky for
[49:52] me because this thing is really driving
[49:54] itself uh this all those videos I
[49:56] thought of fake news that I saw on
[49:58] Twitter they're actually real like this
[50:00] this thing drives itself completely and
[50:02] it drives better than me I I want to add
[50:06] that I'm maybe I'm a bad driver but I
[50:08] felt more secure having the autopilot of
[50:12] Tesla on than driving myself because
[50:14] it's the first time that I drove in
[50:16] America uh and when you see all those
[50:18] developments it's like at some point um
[50:22] we humans don't really need to do
[50:25] anything to have the basic needs like
[50:28] shelter food drinks and getting around
[50:31] covered but uh even on top of that I
[50:33] think we will still have some scoreboard
[50:37] uh which probably will be money which
[50:39] probably will be Bitcoin uh like who who
[50:42] has the nicer robot and who has the
[50:44] nicer Tesla I think this is always a a
[50:48] society thing but it's an interesting
[50:50] thought about what comes with AI
[50:53] Robotics and Bitcoin like comes together
[50:57] and what is the future looking like in
[50:59] in 200 years it's obviously I don't have
[51:01] the answer to that uh but it's it's it's
[51:03] it's it's really fun to think about
[51:06] that yeah because you you just mentioned
[51:08] it then
[51:10] um especially with artificial
[51:13] intelligence um that's for me a a full
[51:17] circle so to say personally I mean I
[51:20] started out I learned programming uh
[51:23] with basic and then soon after with
[51:25] assembler and see so I talk the language
[51:29] of the machines to talk to the
[51:31] machine and now 30 years
[51:34] later the machine is talking to me in my
[51:37] language here which is quite an
[51:38] experience yeah and also like the Tesla
[51:42] and some other stuff uh I only knew from
[51:44] science fiction books or science fiction
[51:46] movies they're getting real step by step
[51:48] uh it's crazy to watch yeah and
[51:50] especially it's it's um getting faster
[51:54] yeah from from year to year and with
[51:57] artificial intelligence uh when they
[52:00] start talking to each other training
[52:01] each other yeah and even using money I
[52:06] mean what what better money would there
[52:08] be than a lightning integration for
[52:11] those uh artificial
[52:14] intelligences absolutely yeah it's it's
[52:16] crazy I I just remembered like eight
[52:19] nine years ago
[52:21] inl uh probably nobody knows in the
[52:24] audience what this is but it's a school
[52:25] form in in AUST
[52:27] um uh eight nine years ago in school
[52:30] basically we discussed if self-driving
[52:33] cars will ever be reality because then
[52:37] Tesla was kind of starting to get the
[52:39] talks on on that and just eight nine
[52:41] years later I'm sitting in a car that
[52:45] actually drives itself I still I'm still
[52:47] not allowed to turn my seat around and
[52:49] play
[52:51] Playstation uh but it's already doing
[52:54] the job it's just like the next step of
[52:57] like let's get the regulatory framework
[52:59] around that so you can do that and send
[53:02] your car home or like uh you you you you
[53:06] can uh buy a car uh use it when you need
[53:10] it if you don't need it you rent it out
[53:12] to other people so you make money with
[53:14] your car like those are weird Concepts
[53:16] or maybe you don't even have to have the
[53:18] car because it's cheaper just to pay for
[53:21] that small uh distance you have have to
[53:24] carry because now you don't have to pay
[53:26] a human being sitting in there because
[53:28] the human being driving the car in the
[53:29] Uber that's the most that's that's the
[53:33] the the the most expensive part of the
[53:35] Uber experience if you if you delete him
[53:38] it's quite cheap actually and probably
[53:39] cheaper than driving hour around with
[53:41] your own car because that's costing a
[53:43] lot of money too uh it's it's just it's
[53:46] just fascinating to think about that um
[53:49] but also uh pure speculation I think
[53:52] just we're going in that direction no no
[53:54] clue how it will look like
[53:57] it be fun to see but I think the funny
[54:00] part
[54:00] is no crazy idea is off the table
[54:03] anything can happen I mean a small
[54:06] example for me because you mentioned the
[54:08] school uh also at I think it was second
[54:11] or third class uh
[54:12] Hotel um I was making a during school I
[54:17] was making a practicum at the FR Hofer
[54:19] Institute and they were building an MP3
[54:22] player and then I did a a project in
[54:27] class um and explaining how compression
[54:30] algorithms work
[54:32] and most of even the professors they
[54:36] laugh ha why do why do we need uh music
[54:40] on our hard diss
[54:42] yeah I think this was 1995 or 1996 so
[54:47] that's that's that year round nobody
[54:50] could imagine yeah then came the
[54:53] iPod did MP3 itself yeah there are a lot
[54:57] of examples yeah especially in
[54:59] technology and it's getting faster every
[55:02] day and we're crazy I think the next
[55:05] year will be crazy the craziest anyone
[55:08] had had
[55:10] witnessed it's uh it's all I always come
[55:12] back to what a time to be alive uh the
[55:15] next coming years the next five 10 years
[55:17] will be really cool um by the way living
[55:20] in the future are you already uh
[55:22] spending uh Bitcoin coming back to the
[55:25] topic of of meum exchange are you
[55:29] personally or let's ask it the other way
[55:32] how far the on the Bitcoin standard are
[55:34] you already uh living um it depends um a
[55:38] few years back I was paying everything
[55:40] in Bitcoin that was possible to pay I
[55:43] was using it everywhere but nowadays I'm
[55:47] not or at least this year at last
[55:51] year when you're not not out much yeah
[55:54] I'm focusing on my work and focusing on
[55:55] myself
[55:57] and basically I'm just just holding
[56:00] because I also I don't have the
[56:02] possibility anywhere around me yeah so
[56:05] it's not possible to go to to a shop and
[56:08] pay there with Bitcoin yeah yeah
[56:10] absolutely you always need those
[56:12] workarounds of like uh you have a maybe
[56:15] a debit card where there's like
[56:17] lightning wallet behind it where you can
[56:19] spend it or you have a credit card that
[56:22] you can pay once a month with Bitcoin
[56:24] all those workarounds that you can have
[56:27] that I'm not in the situation that I I
[56:30] need because my income is not in mostly
[56:33] in Bitcoin my feed income is is stays
[56:36] the same and the Bitcoin income uh is is
[56:38] the bigger part now so I I have to quote
[56:41] unquote spend Bitcoin uh which means
[56:44] sell to Fe it and directly spend it uh
[56:47] and I'm just trying to extend the period
[56:50] of holding Bitcoin to as long as
[56:52] possible to spend it the the latest
[56:55] possible point
[56:57] uh uh and that's that's kind of maybe
[56:59] that's already a kind of a form of a a
[57:03] Bitcoin standard if you just have the
[57:05] last uh part of the Fiats stand it's
[57:07] still in way it's kind of like driving a
[57:09] self-driving car but you still have to
[57:11] sit there and pretend to drive uh and
[57:14] it's it's like using Bitcoin as payments
[57:16] but like the last step the the literally
[57:19] the last step is is not in Bitcoin it's
[57:21] like lightning converted to feed and
[57:24] then pay with Master Card or whatever
[57:27] it's kind of
[57:28] annoying yeah if you could already pay
[57:32] that in Bitcoin would be amazing yeah
[57:34] really cool ask um each and every one of
[57:36] my guests one question um and the
[57:39] question is what can we learn from you
[57:41] besides Bitcoin um I would say one of of
[57:44] my major learnings as also a big fan of
[57:47] the stoics focus on what you control
[57:50] and live more love more and keep
[57:54] studying Bitcoin
[57:56] amazing um we have end in the podcast
[57:59] where the previous guest is asking a
[58:00] question uh for the next guest without
[58:03] knowing who the next guest is your
[58:05] question from a previous guest is one
[58:08] that we maybe had already a little bit
[58:11] in there uh but what what does Bitcoin
[58:15] change in the world Bitcoin will change
[58:19] society to be more fair
[58:22] hopefully more fair in in the F in the
[58:25] first second I understood
[58:27] [Music]
[58:29] Fe more fear yeah that makes sense yeah
[58:32] really cool thank you so much Thomas for
[58:34] for being on the show before I let you
[58:35] go uh where can people find you ask your
[58:37] questions and and reach out to you uh
[58:39] you can find me on X

[59:12] podcast also uh yeah it would be would
[59:15] be fun uh fre free guys uh maybe do a
[59:18] street ball game
