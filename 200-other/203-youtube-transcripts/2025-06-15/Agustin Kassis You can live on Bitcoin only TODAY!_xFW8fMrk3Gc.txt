[00:00] in 20 years I think we'll be in some
[00:02] kind of Bitcoin standard Bitcoin just is
[00:04] superior we already just won we did have
[00:06] inflation since ever like we've been
[00:08] born with this [ __ ] we are used to have
[00:10] two digits of inflation monthly yearly
[00:14] 150 200% of inflation last year we have
[00:17] 1% daily inflation rate so you can
[00:19] imagine that there a super mess Bitcoin
[00:22] thrives with a stupid government Bitcoin
[00:24] actually just turned me into a
[00:25] Libertarian I have actually a tattoo
[00:27] here with Bitcoin and the libertarian
[00:30] serpent Bitcoin separates money from
[00:32] State money is the most important thing
[00:34] to fix and everything else is second the
[00:36] Bitcoin Utopia would be that we don't
[00:39] talk about that thing we wouldn't need
[00:41] to talk about how to fix money because
[00:43] money would be just Bitcoin the more
[00:45] users the more NOS the more channels you
[00:48] do have the better it
[00:51] [Music]
[00:55] works do do you think that that
[00:57] lightning will be the the main
[01:00] Layer Two that the clue that uh binds
[01:03] everything together yeah I absolutely
[01:06] think that actually
[01:08] um if you want I can just tell you how I
[01:12] feel that Bitcoin going to end up
[01:14] actually I have a way of explaining this
[01:16] is bom has three layers one layer the
[01:20] first one will be the blockchain which
[01:22] is meant to just uh reserve of value
[01:25] like digital gold this is the blockchain
[01:28] then you have the second layer which I
[01:30] do believe it's lightning I think it's
[01:32] integrat naturally and natively with
[01:35] Bitcoin and the the layer zero would be
[01:38] the people which is the the community
[01:41] with no with no people with no Community
[01:44] with no humans with no you like a group
[01:47] of people that just actually are agreed
[01:51] agreed like you said agree with this
[01:53] kind of protocol does no no layer one no
[01:55] layer two so I think to I think honestly
[01:58] that yeah Layer Two is definitely
[02:01] lightning I maybe I don't know Ark can
[02:04] just play along with with it but
[02:06] definitely yeah I do believe it's
[02:07] lightning interesting yeah really cool
[02:09] perfect then let's let's get you from
[02:11] Argentina yeah very cool what's going on
[02:15] in in Argentina with with Bitcoin
[02:17] currently well Bitcoin is not well known
[02:21] like broadly known um
[02:25] Argentina it's a for crypto related it's
[02:29] really
[02:30] it's really it's really adopted like I
[02:33] we have a lot of a lot of apps that you
[02:36] are able to just handle crypto
[02:38] especially usdt USD is super popular
[02:40] here it used to be super popular for
[02:43] many years because uh of the inflation
[02:46] rate is so hard people were not used to
[02:49] have to use ours like peso their local
[02:52] currency so the US dollar is really is
[02:56] for many years was always the popular
[02:58] currency for people to just have
[03:01] savings
[03:03] so um the usdt was like a perfect way to
[03:07] just handle digital money because the
[03:09] government was always always it was pro
[03:12] pro forbidden to just people just buy US
[03:15] dollars so you have always to go to the
[03:18] black market and the ucct was a a
[03:20] perfect solution for this so then people
[03:23] started using crypto and Bitcoin was
[03:26] always uh like used not massive ly but
[03:30] we have a a strong community at First
[03:32] grassroot Community since I don't know
[03:35] 2011
[03:36] 2013 just back here in Buenos Iris
[03:39] actually I founded the co-founded the
[03:42] Bitcoin space here in Argentina as well
[03:44] in
[03:45] 2013 oh 13 already that is that is early
[03:49] for for for Bitcoin really cool what
[03:52] what um what made Bitcoin so easy for
[03:56] you to understand uh so early on well
[03:59] that this a the perfect question
[04:01] actually I think we argentinians get
[04:05] Bitcoin kind of naturally it's not that
[04:08] everybody gets it instantly but I think
[04:11] it's easier for us because we do know we
[04:14] are like um do Sons and Daughters of
[04:19] inflation we did have inflation since
[04:22] ever like we've been born with this [ __ ]
[04:25] so we I'm sorry are you able to ins like
[04:28] swear a little bit of course of course
[04:31] you can okay
[04:34] um well the thing is we are used to have
[04:38] um two diges of inflation monthly so
[04:43] yearly 150 200% of inflation last year
[04:47] we ended with it was calculated because
[04:50] we have
[04:51] 1% uh daily inflation rate so you can
[04:54] imagine that that's a super mess super
[04:57] mess the people don't value we are
[05:00] argentinians we have a natural way of
[05:02] thinking about money because we don't we
[05:06] are used to not having the or not using
[05:11] the official currency that the
[05:13] government provides so we have like yeah
[05:16] you we are used to that so that's the
[05:19] thing uh we are we are naturally born to
[05:23] not obey the government not only with
[05:25] their own local currency that they just
[05:27] want us to use we are used to have uh
[05:31] three blocks away everywhere you have uh
[05:33] these quas that are like special places
[05:36] where you can just exchange US dollars
[05:38] in the black market because it's illegal
[05:41] to buy US dollars so even though they
[05:44] just don't want us to buy dollars we do
[05:46] it anyway and we did it so so so strong
[05:51] that uh the the market the the US dollar
[05:55] market price like the black market price
[05:58] is actually in the newspaper has been
[06:00] there for many years so the government
[06:02] is they don't even fight back for that
[06:05] thing they just know that most of the
[06:07] people just have their money uh like how
[06:10] we call here at
[06:12] the um how do you say in
[06:15] the you you have your bed at the bottom
[06:19] of your bed like we we have the mess the
[06:22] mess at the mess okay well we have that
[06:26] saying too here so and people the thing
[06:29] is
[06:30] from 2001 the banks took all our money
[06:34] so we don't trust the government and we
[06:36] don't trust Banks so we naturally we are
[06:39] naturally re we have an active Rebellion
[06:42] against government and Banks so when you
[06:45] tell someone how how money Works H you
[06:48] don't have you can just keep all the
[06:50] inflation part we the Argentinas do know
[06:53] that emission causes inflation so we
[06:57] already know that that that's they could
[06:59] thing about it I've spent some some I
[07:02] spent like a year in New Zealand trying
[07:04] to I always try to push Bitcoin to
[07:07] everyone I'm like a Bitcoin psychopath I
[07:10] don't think you can spend more than five
[07:12] minutes with me without I introducing
[07:14] Bitcoin to the
[07:16] conversation so uh when I was in New
[07:19] Zealand I tried to to just explain Bon
[07:22] to people and it was really hard because
[07:24] most of the people didn't know what
[07:26] inflation was they they didn't know that
[07:29] the that you if you print money you get
[07:31] infl inflation they didn't know that
[07:33] they they like it was like no it doesn't
[07:35] happen and the inflation is done by the
[07:38] supermarket or whatever they they don't
[07:40] even get that so argentinians do have
[07:43] this we do have that thing just um
[07:46] naturally in our daily lives that's
[07:49] super interesting when we think about
[07:51] the implications if the government or a
[07:55] country or Central Bank is losing
[07:56] control of the currency this obviously
[08:00] then gives the people also reason to
[08:02] question everything else the government
[08:04] is doing and uh like once you force
[08:08] people to disobey you because your
[08:11] currency is not working and you want to
[08:13] use other currencies uh just to survive
[08:16] you open the door for uh a population
[08:20] being um completely not respectful of
[08:24] the government which I think is is is a
[08:26] good thing to a certain extent the best
[08:30] situation would be that the government
[08:32] is doing great things and there's a lot
[08:34] of trust in the population to the
[08:35] government because the government is
[08:36] doing good things but of course if
[08:38] they're doing bad things it should
[08:40] reflect to uh to a certain extent how
[08:44] how strict are rules right now in
[08:46] Argentina how free can you live and the
[08:49] second question to that is um how hard
[08:52] are they those rules um uh kind of
[08:56] enforced well there's kind of a par
[08:59] Paradox like I I think the same way like
[09:03] if if the government makes the bad
[09:05] things or it's so it's it it behaves
[09:09] like a drunk uncle you know like what
[09:11] are you doing like they have we have a
[09:13] lot of loss like unnecessary law and
[09:17] unnecessary rules that they just uh ruin
[09:20] everything so what people started to do
[09:23] is just ignore the rules and like 50% of
[09:27] the economy is Black Market so the the
[09:29] thing with this is we are really used to
[09:31] just ignore the government or at least
[09:34] just find loopholes to find a way out of
[09:37] all that those stupid rules so the even
[09:40] the politicians don't obey this rules
[09:43] it's well known so the thing is in
[09:45] regards of of Freedom or Liberty of of
[09:48] if you look for Argentina in a I don't
[09:51] know top top top 100 countries that uh
[09:56] with freedom indexes or whatever
[09:59] well Argentina is really low so you
[10:01] would say oh okay they are they don't
[10:03] have freedom right yeah we don't have
[10:06] freedom in regards of legal system but
[10:10] in the actual stuff you nothing happens
[10:13] if you don't pay taxes nothing no
[10:16] nothing nothing happens so the thing is
[10:19] if you don't do the things like the
[10:21] correct way you can get over it like
[10:24] there's no problem so now with melee
[10:27] that things are going really really much
[10:30] better in Eon and like the economy is
[10:33] going such much better so we we we came
[10:36] from hell okay so he's just fixing the
[10:41] inflation thing and it's becoming like a
[10:43] a country at least a serious country for
[10:46] investors or people just just come come
[10:48] in but once it gets uh super serious uh
[10:53] well the things will the institutions
[10:55] will will start to just running okay and
[10:58] making the the correct things I'm going
[11:00] to be more efficient once they come more
[11:03] efficient maybe those rules that were
[11:06] supposed to be ignored and now they're
[11:08] going to be just applied where like they
[11:11] should be so maybe you lose Freedom like
[11:15] making the the the good things and
[11:16] making the government efficient would
[11:18] actually be a little bit worse for us
[11:21] because you are really we are used to
[11:23] just not obey them so I would I wouldn't
[11:26] say that uh like a more serious and
[11:30] better government would be better for us
[11:33] actually the Paradox is I think Bitcoin
[11:36] thrives in uh with the stupid government
[11:40] if the government is just crazy well
[11:43] bitco thrives bitco was super thriving
[11:45] and the fact when I ches to pitch
[11:47] Bitcoin is way easier to pitch it when
[11:50] you have a like the peso was like [ __ ] a
[11:52] shitty currency and I always always have
[11:55] to point that actually my example was
[11:57] always well the the US dollar is for the
[12:00] peso what the Bitcoin is for the dollar
[12:03] so now for freedom is like um I would
[12:07] say we are more free in regards of the
[12:10] legal system uh I would say that and we
[12:14] definitely we're going to be much better
[12:15] we need to be much better because it's a
[12:17] mess to having all this kind of
[12:19] things yeah Argentina has an impressive
[12:23] history of currency collapses they have
[12:27] sometimes only a currency for like fre
[12:29] for years and then a new one and I think
[12:31] we made once an episode I forgot his
[12:34] name uh once an episode um with in
[12:37] Argentina here on the podcast uh where
[12:40] he talked through all the currencies we
[12:43] used in in that Argentina used since
[12:46] like Theif last 50 or 100 years uh and
[12:49] it was like yeah like we had this and
[12:50] this happened after this year we got a
[12:53] new like it's like oh there's a bunch
[12:55] like it's really hard to keep an
[12:57] overview of all the currency that
[12:59] Argentina had in the last 10 20 50 100
[13:03] years yeah like 50 year 50 years back
[13:06] yeah we probably have like five
[13:08] different currencies yeah definitely
[13:09] they destroyed destroyed and back again
[13:13] and it's it's really it's really weird
[13:15] because it's like when Curren when
[13:18] currency
[13:19] collapses um it's like uh like the
[13:22] illusion of money just uh disappears so
[13:26] you have to manage to get everybody on
[13:28] board to a currency and get get all all
[13:31] these um like trust again we actually
[13:34] have a when the 2001 uh economic
[13:38] collapse that they that Banks took our
[13:41] money we have four uh four presidents in
[13:44] a week for different presidents because
[13:47] it's try like oh can this man handle
[13:50] this do we trust him no [ __ ] and then
[13:53] they just switch to four different ones
[13:55] to make the like the consensus to just
[13:58] is super weird that people were rioting
[14:00] it's super weird when that happens
[14:03] because the money is the things you you
[14:04] can't touch don't mess with that it's
[14:07] it's like messing with the language it's
[14:09] the value language it's a the it's a
[14:12] complete chaos if you don't fix that
[14:14] super important uh as I not as I said it
[14:18] I should uh pull it up I found the video
[14:21] um it was with Ariel aula uh and this
[14:25] was a great video like if you want to
[14:27] know what's what was went wrong with uh
[14:31] Argentina the last uh uh 50 years or I
[14:34] don't know how far we went back we went
[14:36] back a good amount and what currencies
[14:39] they had and stuff like that and and why
[14:41] Bitcoin is going like that that's a
[14:43] great great episode and uh we we went
[14:46] deep there um but yeah it's it's it's
[14:49] interesting uh the Argentina history I I
[14:52] wasn't aware before that episode before
[14:55] I recorded it that it was that bad I
[14:57] thought like they maybe had like one
[14:59] currency or two currencies and it just
[15:00] hyper inflated but if you have to
[15:03] reinvent a new currency this means the
[15:07] previous currency was really
[15:10] bad yeah yeah the the the thing is it's
[15:14] really difficult when they just create a
[15:16] new currency to just sustain it and
[15:19] always the the the problem is uh I
[15:23] always say I I love this phrase
[15:25] everybody's super popular in Bitcoin
[15:27] World fix the money fix the world so the
[15:30] thing is uh the most the the problem is
[15:33] that the government is always
[15:35] overspending so if you don't fix that
[15:38] there's no currency that just can handle
[15:40] that because you always has you always
[15:43] have to just create new demand for that
[15:46] money that new printed paper and it's
[15:50] always the same thing some governments
[15:52] they just overspend they just ruin the
[15:54] currency and then it hyper inflates and
[15:57] they they just pretend to create a new
[15:59] currency and just like okay we're going
[16:00] to start all over but have you fixed the
[16:03] spending problem no but we're going to
[16:05] start it later no you won't like you
[16:07] want to start printing again and you're
[16:09] gonna just break it again it always
[16:11] happens the same thing I think the you
[16:13] know the there's a stat statistics uh I
[16:18] I would check this number uh like Fiat
[16:21] currencies that die they have like 27
[16:25] life expectancy like they just die uh
[16:29] well we have less with with the
[16:32] Argentinian currency actually you should
[16:35] check that but um yeah it's a it's a
[16:41] really in Argentina is one of the top
[16:44] conversations right now is not going on
[16:46] because the inflation rate just went
[16:48] down super this is like a like an
[16:51] economic Miracle mle just did it in less
[16:54] than a year is the people are crazy like
[16:56] the like the hum humor
[16:59] is changed people are able to just it's
[17:02] really weird for you to just go and see
[17:05] the price of yeah 27 years 27 years
[17:10] apparently uh but yeah sorry gone no no
[17:14] uh the thing
[17:16] is sometimes it's really weird for us
[17:19] that we really used to
[17:21] inflation is that you go and see the
[17:24] price of milk the same price as the week
[17:27] before that is weird for us is
[17:31] weird super weird like what do you mean
[17:34] it's the same price like no and it was
[17:39] you know how crazy it is uh for some
[17:43] some people to just it's really it's
[17:45] really difficult to to make things work
[17:49] in the economy and sometimes when I
[17:51] remember that time I can't believe how
[17:53] how could we do it how how can you
[17:56] manage providers like the merch
[18:00] or just plan for three months so the
[18:03] prices of things you have to just uh
[18:05] negotiate every time with my employees I
[18:08] have to negotiate uh again the salary uh
[18:12] every I don't know every two weeks it's
[18:16] every time you lose a lot of time a lot
[18:19] of time super inefficient super
[18:21] inefficient yeah that that's the whole
[18:23] thing that that we we don't talk about a
[18:26] lot every time you have
[18:29] hyperinflation as you just described you
[18:31] have to have a lot of conversations a
[18:32] lot of uh more inefficiencies in
[18:35] contracts and uh in the whole economic
[18:38] system but then also like uh if if you
[18:40] have a new currency uh there's a lot of
[18:43] uh things that come with that that is
[18:46] just like you have to spend a lot of
[18:47] money to create a new currency uh and
[18:50] and do all those things how was it for
[18:53] you did you live your whole life in in
[18:55] Argentina yeah I live my whole life so
[18:58] how was it for you to to live uh in
[19:01] Argentina the past how old are you uh 30
[19:04] 35 38 38 I'm not that bad in in guessing
[19:08] 30 35 I would have said perfect how was
[19:11] it the last 38 years to to live in that
[19:14] country what did you
[19:16] see well um I really love Argentina I
[19:20] really love Argentina even though we got
[19:23] this all mess it's chaos I think it's
[19:25] part of the it's part of the culture uh
[19:29] I love our culture honestly like I
[19:32] wouldn't change the country for now I'm
[19:34] really proud of my country I used to not
[19:36] be proud of my country before
[19:39] La um I was always bitching about like
[19:42] the people here is super Pol like uh
[19:45] everything is politics here people are
[19:47] used to have uh political discussions
[19:50] every time every time and here in
[19:53] Argentina you never get bored never
[19:56] never like you just turn out turn on the
[19:59] TV and just a random stuff is going on
[20:02] like I don't know maybe there's a riot
[20:05] maybe there's a yesterday there was a a
[20:07] love you know
[20:09] empanadas no clue what it is the
[20:12] empanadas are like a local food here is
[20:15] just a piece of thing uh stuff inside
[20:19] like with
[20:20] the uh and the thing
[20:22] is this really popular here and just a
[20:25] lot of people dressed like in bananas
[20:27] with just playing around and uh in the
[20:29] middle of the streets just I don't know
[20:30] what they're reclaiming people claim
[20:33] things here people we are we are half
[20:35] Spanish half Italian so the people are
[20:38] really passionate about we are really
[20:40] Bond each other and the thing is
[20:43] sometimes uh if you have to I the thing
[20:46] is I started to uh appreciate some
[20:49] things of Argentina when I liveed uh in
[20:52] New Zealand for a year and I saw what a
[20:54] first country look like living there
[20:59] first world country and the thing is um
[21:03] a lot of things actually work there but
[21:06] with Argentina is um with the people we
[21:09] have like the people is really different
[21:12] like you're you you bond in a way that
[21:15] you're able to just invite the people in
[21:19] uh we are more like friendly uh people
[21:23] lie a little bit more because it's more
[21:26] they are like
[21:28] used to just just bend the rules
[21:32] sometimes
[21:34] so you have to trust the people you got
[21:37] to create a proper Bond so that that
[21:39] that doesn't happen sometimes the thing
[21:42] I don't like about Argentina is our
[21:45] unpunctuality people don't show on time
[21:48] we don't show on
[21:50] time uh so for you you you came here on
[21:54] time today for the
[21:56] recording I did it yeah I did it but for
[21:59] Tanya for example when I have to meet
[22:01] her well I show on time but there
[22:03] sometimes uh like I do an effort to do
[22:07] that because see here if you you just
[22:09] say 9 a. people don't show up they show
[22:12] up at 9:30 and no not without even an
[22:16] excuse nor a sorry not an apologize okay
[22:20] just 30 minutes later that that's it and
[22:24] the thing is um I was really
[22:29] my parents always always told me to just
[22:32] uh I always knew how the government kind
[22:35] of worked my my parents were really
[22:38] politic people uh politic I mean they
[22:41] always knew they always have to just
[22:43] talk like our house at home we were used
[22:47] to just talk about politics or the
[22:50] economy like I'm a Libertarian if you
[22:53] ask me I would say I would like to live
[22:56] in a country that I don't know who's
[23:00] what's the name of the ministry of
[23:03] Economics like I don't know what's the
[23:05] name of the president I would like uh to
[23:08] live in a place that the government is
[23:10] just an administrator you know but it
[23:13] doesn't it
[23:15] doesn't um make rules every time in
[23:18] Argentina we are really
[23:20] used super used of having the government
[23:23] just telling having new rules all the
[23:26] time all the time a new rule comes in
[23:29] I think Europe is coming to I don't know
[23:31] if you have that kind of situation right
[23:33] now there um but
[23:38] um I think it's beginning to happen but
[23:41] in Argentina we're super used to that
[23:43] and here we got a lot of football we got
[23:45] a lot of passion like people get super
[23:47] passionate like um it's it's super heavy
[23:51] well people get fun of everything it's
[23:53] really normal in Argentina that people
[23:54] make fun of something and just create a
[23:57] community a large community of that it
[24:00] doesn't matter what people are really
[24:02] passionate about
[24:03] that I guess that's why Messi is like
[24:06] such a huge figure also in in Argentina
[24:09] he he he got got so far and it's a big
[24:13] passion of people with football with
[24:15] soccer uh and mess is just like the a
[24:18] really big one I found I think I found
[24:21] the food if if you mean that I'm really
[24:23] interested also in different foods I
[24:26] really like tasting new foods when I
[24:28] when new countes is that what you talked
[24:30] about Empanada exactly yeah that's the
[24:33] thing how would you describe an empanada
[24:36] yeah yeah ban is a type of a baked or
[24:40] fried turnover consisting of pastry and
[24:43] filling common in Spain other Southern
[24:45] European countries North African
[24:47] countries Latin American countries in
[24:49] the Philippines I mean a lot of
[24:50] countries then I I never heard about
[24:52] that but uh looks very delicious to be
[24:55] honest yeah you have multiple stuffing
[24:58] side you have meat ham and cheese you
[25:00] have multiple flavors yeah it's really
[25:03] really popular in Latin in like all
[25:05] South America is super popular we have a
[25:08] some you have different versions some of
[25:10] them are larger or smaller but most of
[25:13] them are are that and the thing is uh
[25:17] the food well here we have a this is a
[25:20] country of the meat we eat meat so the
[25:23] Carn car carnivore diet you can
[25:26] definitely do it here we are super super
[25:29] fan of meat we do know all the cats you
[25:31] got a random Argentinian and he knows
[25:34] what the cat okay this is a part of the
[25:36] cow like we do know that sometimes
[25:39] people just come here foreigners and say
[25:42] okay I want beef and we say what do you
[25:44] mean beef what what what part what it's
[25:47] like it's like I go in somewhere else
[25:50] and say I want vegetables what do you
[25:52] mean vegetables what what vegetable so
[25:54] we do know the parts of the the the meat
[25:58] very well uh people coming here just if
[26:02] you're a vegetarian vegan you got to
[26:04] have a a really bad you got to have
[26:07] problems here it's really difficult it's
[26:09] really difficult to do it here it's like
[26:11] meat only and then you have a little bit
[26:14] of you can always find a a different
[26:17] restaurant we have a lot of different
[26:19] options but uh the normal ones are
[26:22] always
[26:23] meat it's meat this is the country of
[26:26] the meat country of the meat I think uh
[26:29] Bitcoin it's a good counter then for for
[26:31] bitcoiners I think it's a great counter
[26:33] actually for people that save their
[26:36] stored their the financial energy in
[26:38] Bitcoin people that have maybe an income
[26:42] uh from all over the world that doesn't
[26:44] depend on one country so they have
[26:46] income basically globally and then they
[26:49] can uh maybe have some savings uh that
[26:53] they can spend in US dollar in in
[26:55] Argentina mid diet there's probably a
[26:57] lot of uh meat going on so it seems to
[27:00] be a great place for bitcoiners who are
[27:03] uh independent of
[27:05] location yeah definitely uh I would lie
[27:09] if you if I would tell you this is the
[27:11] best moment to just uh use your
[27:13] financial energy uh I would just make a
[27:16] bet on the country uh because we're
[27:19] trying to solve all the issues that
[27:20] happened if you came two years ago the
[27:23] prices were three times less you could
[27:27] actually get an apartment in the like
[27:30] downtown uh I don't know 90 90 M squared
[27:35] 90 Square met
[27:36] sorry for
[27:38] $300 then you could have a like beef you
[27:42] know like dish beef uh good quality for
[27:49] $3 it used to be super cheap extremely
[27:53] cheap then it and now it's it's more
[27:57] more expensive definitely more expensive
[28:01] sometimes people say we are just trying
[28:02] to figure out all the prices just
[28:04] remember we we came from a lot of
[28:06] inflation so people need to like the
[28:09] free market needs to just run to fix
[28:12] this the things up so the merchants like
[28:14] people need to learn again hey don't buy
[28:16] this PL because we were we were really
[28:18] used to buy the same places somewhere
[28:21] else because you you didn't have the
[28:23] correct signals so you didn't know what
[28:25] what was the price of things so now
[28:27] people are trying to get used and the
[28:29] people need to learn uh to if something
[28:33] is get is way too expensive just don't
[28:35] buy it I'm sorry don't ask the
[28:37] government to just try to control prices
[28:40] you you need to do it on your own so we
[28:43] are kind of that kind of face but
[28:45] definitely it's a very good place to to
[28:48] just uh use your as you said your
[28:52] financial energy here definitely you're
[28:54] able to just use that that because
[28:56] you're able to convert it right
[28:58] away right away you have a lot of places
[29:01] you don't even have
[29:02] to um if you come I know most people
[29:07] would say what are you saying like I we
[29:09] have like a lot of Germans that came
[29:10] along and said but but that's is that's
[29:13] illegal of course it's illegal people
[29:16] are like just if you come here you're
[29:19] gonna do illegal stuff I'm
[29:21] sorry you that's it that's the country
[29:26] like it's it's a normal thing like
[29:28] people sometimes they freak out and say
[29:30] like but what happens if the no it's not
[29:33] so for example let me tell you some just
[29:36] an example uh that Tania for example was
[29:39] really crazy about it um we make parties
[29:43] in ltown we have a big house there and
[29:47] to as as neighbors just sometimes if
[29:51] it's it's not too loud but the neighbors
[29:53] just the [ __ ]
[29:55] anyway and what happens is uh uh you can
[29:58] you can have this sorted out with the
[30:00] police directly so you just talk to them
[30:04] and sort the all the staff all the all
[30:06] stuff with them and negotiate with them
[30:09] it's it's it's weird but it has to be
[30:12] done it has to be done it's the only way
[30:15] because people here is is uh people are
[30:18] really used to do the stuff maybe you
[30:20] just if you want you can skip that part
[30:23] to to not do the recommendation in the
[30:25] podcast
[30:26] whatever you're fre
[30:29] don't do illegal stuff except you are in
[30:33] Argentina yeah I know I know it's weird
[30:36] it's it's it's turning around we're
[30:38] becoming a a first world country and the
[30:41] thing with Messi what you said it's
[30:43] really important it's really
[30:45] important because something changed in
[30:48] the country like the values of the
[30:50] country change we used to have Maradona
[30:53] you know Maradona Diego Maradona of
[30:56] course Diego Maradona well this is
[30:58] unpopular opinion I might get killed by
[31:00] saying this by uh but this guy was I I
[31:06] hate him so much even though he's a yeah
[31:09] super yeah the thing is he was as as I
[31:14] mentioned we are super fun and sometimes
[31:17] fan of people and the thing is Maradona
[31:20] was like a god like a popular God here
[31:22] like an idol okay and the think he was
[31:26] um worshiped here worship that people
[31:28] have like a church like it was
[31:31] crazy uh so the thing is this came this
[31:35] guy just came from really low parts of
[31:39] of like social economics we really poor
[31:43] and the thing is
[31:45] um this guy just ruined his life
[31:49] personally he had a very good
[31:51] professional life but his personal life
[31:54] he just left a lot of sons just
[31:57] abandoned
[31:58] he uh beat his wives uh just have a drug
[32:03] himself he he was he was with a
[32:05] communist he went to Cuba he was with a
[32:09] a girl of of 15 years old he was not
[32:12] definitely not a good example for
[32:14] society he just he ruined a good
[32:17] opportunity to make good example for the
[32:19] people so what happened is when he died
[32:22] he was like alcoholic all the sins you
[32:25] can expect by a guy okay
[32:28] and the thing is people worship Him and
[32:31] and consider that okay it's part of our
[32:33] culture like you should understand him
[32:36] like we humans are I like that that's a
[32:39] that's genuine you know that's he's a a
[32:41] real human being and the thing I I never
[32:45] respect him when he died I actually have
[32:49] po [ __ ] posting and God hate a lot of
[32:52] hate I receive a lot of hate but a lot
[32:55] of people were thinking the same thing
[32:57] and when Messi came along the thing that
[33:00] Messi was missing is that he never won a
[33:02] World Cup never and Maradona did so when
[33:07] Messi uh kind of took over Messi we won
[33:11] the World Cup and Messi became he was
[33:14] actually an idol but then nobody could
[33:16] say that maradon was better than Messi
[33:19] like now Messi just won him in every
[33:22] every time every every part you can can
[33:25] imagine so Messi is a good example he's
[33:28] a good dude he's an honest guy he's
[33:30] humble he has a
[33:32] family uh so that kind of thing it might
[33:36] look weird for people but here is super
[33:39] important to have that this kind of an
[33:41] idol this kind of an example remember
[33:43] that Argentina has 50% poverty just
[33:46] picture that 50% of the country is lower
[33:50] class so a lot of people just uh watch
[33:54] this kind of Idols to know to follow
[33:57] that example so Messi is is a really
[34:00] good example of
[34:03] this and didn't knew about Diego Maron
[34:06] that he did that all those things
[34:07] honestly I just know him as as a as a
[34:10] soccer player as a football player um
[34:12] but yeah Messi is a is a big one
[34:14] everyone knows him like that's he he's
[34:17] one of the few people on Earth that are
[34:21] recognized wherever they go like there's
[34:24] like uh maybe Messi Cristiano Ronaldo
[34:28] maybe The Rock Johnson maybe Donald
[34:30] Trump like there's only like a few
[34:32] handful of people that have such a
[34:34] unique personality that is so widely
[34:37] known uh that you can put them anywhere
[34:40] in the world and people recognize him uh
[34:43] and if you can connect that with
[34:46] something positive and being a role
[34:47] model I think that's really powerful uh
[34:50] and that's really something that you
[34:52] should strive for and I I agree with you
[34:54] it's sad when people in that position
[34:58] not use that for something good and for
[35:01] a positive role model I I I that's a
[35:04] that's a missed opportunity right there
[35:06] uh and I I fully wholeheartedly agree
[35:09] with you uh
[35:11] here definitely it's the role model is
[35:15] like people tell me okay you should be
[35:17] in that position you know this this guy
[35:20] came from nowhere he came from hell he
[35:23] started going up and he just went crazy
[35:25] with all that thing because he wasn't
[35:26] prepared nobody would be prepared just
[35:28] going that high just from the low class
[35:32] and going just yeah I know that but it's
[35:35] not that Messi was rich or something he
[35:37] like you have you have good examples I
[35:39] don't like that kind of excuse that just
[35:41] excuse everything because this was a a
[35:44] really diff difficult position I do
[35:46] value Messi being having that kind of
[35:48] role model and some things change in
[35:50] Argentina as well so you you already
[35:52] know this thing right everybody knows
[35:54] this and it's really popular the thing
[35:57] like we men make uh Hard Times Hard Time
[36:00] you already know so I do believe that we
[36:04] had really hard times here we have the W
[36:07] people just taking over here and uh uh a
[36:13] lot of things changed like when Mara
[36:16] died uh we won the World Cup we got
[36:19] Messi that we had a very good role model
[36:22] actually the the the football team when
[36:25] they came here to just party and
[36:28] celebrate of this of this thing they
[36:30] didn't didn't go with the government
[36:33] they usually go with the government
[36:35] because it's like the representation of
[36:37] Argentina they every historically the
[36:40] the football team the official team
[36:42] always at least have a picture with the
[36:46] president this didn't happen here so
[36:49] they just say no we don't know we don't
[36:51] want to mix it with politics and
[36:53] whatever that was a message a message
[36:57] that they didn't want to just not even a
[36:59] picture so that changed a lot of people
[37:02] just say okay what's going on like if
[37:05] the official our official our
[37:07] Gladiators are not uh respecting uh this
[37:12] kind of movement this this government a
[37:15] lot of people just started
[37:17] watching and then melay uh came along
[37:21] and melee just you know melee already
[37:25] he's a a guy with balls
[37:28] he was uh he did a like a Skyrocket um
[37:33] trajectory like he push really hard he
[37:37] was every TV show uh he was really hard
[37:41] I don't know if we want to talk about
[37:42] him but is he did a lot like he he's
[37:46] pushing for the culture battle here
[37:49] really really hard really hard and he
[37:52] didn't he's he was super aggressive I
[37:55] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[37:59] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[38:01] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[38:04] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[38:07] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch

[38:44] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[38:47] down in the descriptions I love those
[38:49] watches so so much if you watch or
[38:53] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[38:55] I'll guess you already bought some
[38:57] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[39:00] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[39:03] in a hardware wallet my personal
[39:05] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[39:07] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[39:10] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[39:12] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[39:15] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[39:18] with the code Robin at the checkout
[39:20] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[39:24] your bitbox and the next step is to
[39:27] really level up your sovereignty as an
[39:29] individual you have to have the most
[39:31] secure self- custody setup you have to
[39:34] secure your own devices you have to
[39:37] protect your privacy you have to set up
[39:40] an inheritance plan and depending on
[39:42] where you live you even want to have a
[39:45] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[39:48] in case something goes really really
[39:49] wrong and through all those steps the
[39:51] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[39:57] /p Partners robobin you even get a 30
[40:01] minute free call to find out how you can
[40:04] level up your sovereignty I think that's
[40:07] really interesting with with chave M
[40:09] like uh what has changed with him and uh
[40:13] in Argentina and and what was he trying
[40:15] to do obviously with Bitcoin what I like
[40:18] just to give you context what I know
[40:20] about chavier M um he is really for aan
[40:25] economics uh but uh I don't know if he
[40:28] fully grasps what Bitcoin actually is
[40:31] because he always opens up Bitcoin but
[40:33] also other cryptos um H and then he
[40:36] wants to destroy the central bank which
[40:39] I think really uh is is a good step but
[40:42] he also wants to dollarize the country
[40:45] which is probably way better to have US
[40:47] Dollars than your own uh currency
[40:49] especially if it hyper inflates with
[40:51] that history and that he just wants to
[40:53] destroy a lot of government agencies
[40:55] which I'm also big fan of uh that that's
[40:58] kind of the the the frame that I know
[41:01] now about CH Mal um uh what I don't know
[41:04] is like what he actually did right now
[41:07] in Argentina what is his plan and where
[41:09] does he want to go and what he's
[41:10] actually trying to push well the the
[41:12] best thing he did for Argentina as he's
[41:15] still doing it is the cultural battle
[41:18] that the cultural battle is the best
[41:20] it's the best he was doing a pretty good
[41:22] job before being president so the the
[41:25] thing he did is he actually just went to
[41:29] everywhere uh and just pointed pointed
[41:32] the problem out this is socialism you're
[41:35] just a bunch of [ __ ] trying to
[41:37] rule us all you're liars and this thing
[41:41] kind of exploded in the lockdowns as
[41:43] well uh everybody was uh the lockdowns
[41:46] was uh a lot of PE a lot of things
[41:48] happened for melee to just make this the
[41:52] lockdowns were actually again this is a
[41:55] paradox but sometimes you you need uh
[41:58] bad things for you to get stronger you
[42:01] need those and the lockdowns we the the
[42:04] Govern the Korean government at that
[42:07] time uh was uh exposed exposed super
[42:12] exposed for a lot of people and M he was
[42:16] always fighting against like if you see
[42:19] her videos his videos three years ago
[42:22] four years ago he was just yelling you
[42:25] left these [ __ ] out loud in the
[42:28] middle of a a TV show every time with
[42:32] seven people just fighting against him
[42:35] and he was telling the truth everybody
[42:37] was saying this this guy represents me
[42:40] and actually uh people were just arguing
[42:43] about his way of saying things they said
[42:46] okay he might be right but he would just
[42:48] lower the tone no the tone is correct
[42:52] this is an emergency we have 50% poverty
[42:55] and it's going down every time
[42:57] the the politicians are [ __ ] Rich
[43:00] what are you going to say they are just
[43:01] lying and they have the media as well
[43:03] they have all the like the concentrated
[43:06] power they want to just send us back to
[43:08] Venezuela we have like um a lot of
[43:11] people in La crypta for example our the
[43:14] biggest Bitcoin community in Argentina
[43:16] actually like 20% 30% of the people are
[43:19] Venezuelans the Venezuelans are part of
[43:23] the Argentinian Revolution as well uh
[43:26] those come from hell they came from hell
[43:29] they came from
[43:30] socialism so he just m just point out
[43:33] the the this problem he said like okay
[43:36] you socialists are just liars woke
[43:38] people are just liars some people do do
[43:41] defend socialism because because they
[43:43] are ignorant some of them because they
[43:46] just lie because they have guilt and say
[43:50] okay we should do that but they don't
[43:52] have any time nor they don't want to
[43:54] make the effort to just learn a little
[43:55] bit about economics so what do you need
[43:58] to do to just fix the poverty so mle was

[45:51] president
[45:52] really so all his campaign he didn't
[45:57] have to put a single dollar he
[46:00] had he had um in front of him all the
[46:05] power all the all politicians all the
[46:07] money all the corporations everything

[46:11] printing money just give the money to
[46:14] poor people to buy them votes like super
[46:18] just picture yourself the this 40 years
[46:21] all politics everyone together and this
[46:25] guy without money he just the only
[46:27] campaign he did was okay I'm going to he

[46:57] cool picture he's always like this
[46:59] people were mocking him anyway that
[47:03] everybody want to get this picture so a
[47:06] lot of people taking that picture a lot

[47:11] talk to him he couldn't even walk 100
[47:15] meters he was stop like everybody was
[47:18] crazy that's was was his campaign the
[47:22] the people wanted him to rise the people
[47:25] were was like it was so evident that
[47:28] that people wanted no a single
[47:30] politician had that in all I have never
[47:33] seen that in in my country never and I
[47:36] think nothing had never happened in the
[47:39] in the history of Argentina this kind of
[47:41] popular demand for him to just come
[47:45] remember he's super rude super rude that
[47:49] just it was crazy for him to it's it's
[47:51] still crazy now sometimes I can't
[47:52] believe that he's the president it's and
[47:56] he's still he's the same guy he's just
[47:59] uh insulting them uh still and that's
[48:03] the beauty of him the because he just
[48:05] he's saying the truth we are being
[48:08] robbed we are [ __ ] being robbed you
[48:10] had a a lot of psychopath that taking
[48:12] over the country you should just expose
[48:15] that and that's his mission that's
[48:17] that's the thing he does better so I
[48:20] really appreciate I was um before him I
[48:22] was saying okay I'm not I'm not going to
[48:25] do it in this country I really don't
[48:27] want to live here because it's going to
[48:28] become Venezuela definitely and I don't
[48:31] want to live in a country that's going
[48:32] to taken over by I don't want it to I
[48:35] don't want to just walk by the streets
[48:38] and have people eating from the garbage
[48:42] all the all the society just going down
[48:45] your friends everybody the economy goes
[48:47] [ __ ] you have like tons of inflation who
[48:51] wants to live in that
[48:54] country it's it's super um one thing
[48:57] that I see right now with all the
[49:02] presidential elections with
[49:04] entrepreneurs with businesses is
[49:08] extremely a clear Trend towards personal
[49:12] Brands we talked about it before uh
[49:15] Trump won because you knew who Trump was
[49:20] the thing that we knew about camela
[49:22] Harris was she was against Trump I I I
[49:27] have no clue what she even I mean I'm
[49:29] not voting in the US I'm Austrian so I
[49:32] don't deeply research but except that
[49:35] she doesn't like Trump and she doesn't
[49:38] want him in office I have no clue what
[49:41] she actually stands for we have an idea
[49:43] what Trump stands for we have an idea
[49:46] what El musk is standing for what he
[49:48] does uh other billionaires other rich
[49:51] people are in the background he goes in
[49:53] the in the
[49:55] in he goes uh as as far as
[50:00] possible in in the in the lights to show
[50:03] his projects to get funding to get all
[50:06] the interest to get everything going and
[50:08] the same way uh chavier M won because I
[50:13] watched the election going down in
[50:16] Argentina and I watched the candidates
[50:18] but I don't even remember the names of
[50:20] the other candidates have no clue how
[50:22] they even called uh and I watched the
[50:25] the election I I was even staying up
[50:28] till like 1: in the morning to see the
[50:31] results and stuff like that and I only
[50:33] know chv M
[50:35] so if if you want to do anything in this
[50:38] new world you have to be present and be
[50:42] a personal brand and be authentic and
[50:45] connect with people otherwise they don't
[50:48] even know who you are what why they
[50:51] should trust you that's why Donald Trump
[50:53] went to all the podcasts without all the
[50:56] podcast presence uh without the
[50:58] connections with those content creators
[51:01] uh he could have not connected with with
[51:04] uh the the US um US citizens because he
[51:08] needs to build that personal brand he
[51:09] needs to build the personal connection
[51:11] to to this massive audience in the same
[51:13] way with chavier M he was just uh uh you
[51:17] you you know those um videos where he
[51:20] rips something apart and like he throws
[51:23] punches at the binata that's just
[51:25] something that sticks in your PR and uh
[51:28] that that's something that I noticed
[51:30] like if you want to do anything uh it's
[51:33] way easier to do it as a personal brand
[51:36] and those Elite things like mainstream
[51:38] media this news articles uh those big
[51:41] government institutions they're just
[51:44] grumbling down and the power goes back
[51:46] to the individual uh and uh the internet
[51:50] uh podcasting Nostra Bitcoin that's all
[51:53] things that point toward that individual
[51:57] empowerment against uh that thing so I
[52:01] really hope that we don't have to move
[52:04] like Europeans don't have to move to
[52:06] Argentina or to El Salvador to America
[52:08] or to some other place because we have a
[52:11] socialist government I really hope that
[52:13] we have that upstanding that Freedom
[52:16] Movement all in the Western countries
[52:19] maybe even like in all of the world uh
[52:22] that's that but that's just my hope and
[52:25] I L uh I mean we're already one hour in
[52:29] and we didn't really talk about Bitcoin
[52:30] but I think it's a it's it's a great
[52:32] podcast anyways and I think it's it
[52:35] really shines a light on why Bitcoin is
[52:37] also important well I do believe uh yeah
[52:40] that's important I um well what to to
[52:44] just sum of that thing up um the best
[52:48] thing about what happened with melee it
[52:50] wasn't mle himself it was the fact that
[52:55] all the people want that wanted that
[52:57] change that I was sharing the same
[53:00] country like the
[53:02] Democracy uh most of the people wanted
[53:05] that kind of change and they were
[53:07] willing to do that and they were willing
[53:09] to risk that even though it wasn't that
[53:12] popular and I I think that's the best
[53:16] thing to be to to make it happen you
[53:19] need to be the the people to to be woke
[53:23] not not woke you know the term to be
[53:25] awake
[53:27] um I think you you need that in the
[53:29] country sometimes you don't have that
[53:31] luxury like Venezuelans for
[53:34] example
[53:36] and uh Bitcoin of course it's always the
[53:39] safe heaven Bitcoin is the safe heaven I
[53:43] do believe that Bitcoin uh Bitcoin
[53:45] actually just turned me into a
[53:47] Libertarian that's why I I can't I can't
[53:50] separate Bitcoin from you know we I have
[53:53] actually a tattoo here with Bitcoin and
[53:56] the libertarian serpent actually
[54:00] nice um I do I can't separate like I
[54:05] think Bitcoin separates money from state
[54:08] so we should take that thing out of them
[54:11] definitely the government is uh is just
[54:15] something we we haven't figured out a
[54:17] better solution for this but it's
[54:19] actually a problem it's always a problem
[54:21] I always see uh the government with
[54:24] skeptic eyes even with milay
[54:27] uh so I wouldn't be I wouldn't
[54:31] be comfortable of having M I don't know
[54:34] even if if he has the the correct way of
[54:37] Mind economics I wouldn't be uh good if
[54:41] he were a dictator you know if something
[54:43] just okay I know this is the correct
[54:45] economics um he just comes from Heaven
[54:49] no I want the people to be uh to push
[54:52] for it because you need the society to
[54:55] think that way
[54:57] and I think Bitcoin what what it does is
[55:01] if we take money out from the state what
[55:04] else can we get out from him that's the
[55:08] thing I I I I started thinking like
[55:11] we're going to just take the this leg
[55:13] this leg of or just Fiat system the the
[55:16] the ability to just devaluate everyone
[55:19] just to take energy from everyone
[55:22] remotely without
[55:25] permission uh that's insane that's
[55:28] insane so I think it's really I always
[55:32] say that Bitcoin is a like
[55:36] something like a human Revolution some
[55:38] Civilization Revolution in that kind of
[55:40] level sometimes I do have this kind of
[55:44] argument with crypto crypto guys you
[55:46] know the crypto people the crypto Bros I
[55:49] don't know if you got those people there
[55:51] we had a lot of them mostly because
[55:55] sometimes as I said
[55:57] they are they use us they start using
[55:59] Solana or any other [ __ ]
[56:02] ethereum and then don't get that Bitcoin
[56:05] separates money from State they are not
[56:08] they don't see that they don't even I
[56:10] don't know if they do care they just
[56:13] want the numbers go up that's a that's a
[56:15] good point uh and I do see Bitcoin from
[56:19] all the things that we've uh talked
[56:21] about I think Bitcoin is the most
[56:23] important tool for individual
[56:26] empowerment money is so fundamental to
[56:29] our life uh if if we if we don't get
[56:34] money into our own control everything
[56:37] else doesn't matter like it's great that
[56:41] we have uh uh voices now on the internet
[56:45] that we can speak freely more freely
[56:48] more freely Twitter gets more free uh we
[56:51] have Nostra that is completely free um
[56:55] uh but even even if we have Nostra and
[56:58] it's completely free and everyone is
[56:59] using it if we still can't control our
[57:01] own money because we still don't have
[57:04] then
[57:05] is then they have us at the most
[57:08] vulnerable place like money is the most
[57:11] important thing to fix and everything
[57:13] else is second so so that's where where
[57:17] where I think it it comes from and uh I
[57:20] do think you also probably see that like
[57:22] that and you probably have an real world
[57:24] example of that in in Argentina from
[57:28] that I I totally agree uh that's why I
[57:32] my favorite phrase is fix the money fix
[57:33] the world I I think that's the most
[57:35] important thing you you need to do uh
[57:38] sometimes when I talk about Bitcoin like
[57:40] remember I've been in ecosis in like 11
[57:42] years so I talk to a lot of people just
[57:45] trying to pitch to everyone and some
[57:48] people might say okay but money is not
[57:50] the best important sometimes they say no
[57:52] money is not the the the most important
[57:54] thing in the world Okay so what is it
[57:57] your energy do you care about your
[57:59] energy your time what what is it like
[58:02] yoga what what's your what's your
[58:04] biggest passion well let me let me know
[58:06] what's your biggest passion who whatever
[58:08] you say you need energy and your time
[58:11] okay so you need to take care of your
[58:13] energy and time and that's funny it's
[58:15] not something dirty you should be able
[58:16] to talk about it to what is this
[58:19] actually the best like the best case
[58:22] scenario like the Bitcoin Utopia would
[58:25] be that that we don't talk about that
[58:27] thing we we wouldn't need to talk about
[58:30] how to fix money because money would be
[58:33] just Bitcoin and that's it it wouldn't
[58:36] be a problem you know it's like um it's
[58:40] like we're talking always about the
[58:42] medicine because we are ill but once we
[58:45] get Fiat out of the system we won we
[58:47] just fix the thing we we need to just a
[58:50] way to store our energy just your energy
[58:53] if you want to just if you like football
[58:55] you like yoga whatever you like you need
[58:58] energy so you need a way to store energy
[59:00] you sacrifice your own time to go to a
[59:02] job to get energy back for you to be
[59:06] able to just buy the stuff you need or
[59:08] contract the service you need or have
[59:10] enough time to do whatever you want to
[59:12] want to do that's it it's not that we
[59:14] are just obsessed with with having a a
[59:17] lot of money we are obsessed for people
[59:20] to just be able to store and transfer
[59:23] their energy without uh any any anyone
[59:27] that can take uh their energy off you
[59:30] know it has to be neutral that's
[59:33] it and some some people I think they
[59:36] they they just uh think we are
[59:38] materialistic or something like that
[59:40] like oh we you just think about it no
[59:42] yeah we we're thinking about that
[59:44] because uh it's it's important for
[59:46] everyone this is important for everyone
[59:49] it's not just people that's why I get uh
[59:53] against trading and all that [ __ ]
[59:56] because uh it's not that you can do it
[59:59] anybody could do it it's okay you you
[60:01] need to just uh make increase your
[60:04] wealth it's okay but sometimes you can't
[60:08] explain Bitcoin through trading that
[60:10] makes like you know it's like are you
[60:13] going to start from there instead of
[60:16] just just explain the history of money
[60:20] just that's that's the first step not
[60:23] trading like how to people to be rich
[60:26] and how to make people just sell it I
[60:29] won't sell I already sold when you get
[60:32] your your dollars off or your F currency
[60:35] off you go to bitcoin that's it you
[60:37] already just opt
[60:39] out so I think it's really important to
[60:42] make this distinction I think that's the
[60:44] big the Bitcoin movement is that and as
[60:47] I I told you before I don't think
[60:50] Bitcoin is a technological Revolution
[60:53] it's not Bitcoin is a um more like a
[60:57] human Revolution because if you just say
[60:59] that Bitcoin some I think some people uh
[61:03] take it
[61:04] wrong uh they say it's a technological
[61:07] Revolution because it uses technology to
[61:09] fix a problem okay so every industry in
[61:13] the world uses technology like this
[61:16] streaming or everything you do every
[61:19] industry in the world uses internet
[61:23] every every industry so every the
[61:25] industry is technological then because
[61:28] it's used to technology technology is a
[61:30] way with you humans use just a tool it's
[61:34] just the way we humans just innovate
[61:36] that's it so every Revolution from now
[61:39] on would going to be a technological
[61:41] Revolution no this is a Civilization
[61:44] Revolution we're taking back money you
[61:46] don't have to be a nerd or a technical
[61:49] person to use Bitcoin maybe now we're
[61:52] just building the tools and maybe the
[61:53] nerds or technical people are just more
[61:57] more popular because we're just building
[62:00] the path but it's not a I wouldn't say
[62:03] it's a technological Revolution because
[62:04] that makes people think that it's just a
[62:06] ner thing or you just need to need to be
[62:09] an expert te Sav whatever and it's just
[62:12] money it's of course you need to to
[62:15] build the tools first but it's just
[62:17] money and money is for everyone it's not
[62:19] a technological revolution in that sense
[62:21] it's just a human Revolution
[62:23] Civilization Revolution Maybe but it's
[62:26] more like a movement I do believe
[62:27] Bitcoin is more is more like a
[62:30] movement I I love that and I especially
[62:33] love what you said about trading uh
[62:36] because there are a lot of Traders and I
[62:38] think the only people that really make
[62:41] money in trading are the people the the
[62:44] content creators that make online
[62:47] courses about
[62:48] trading those are probably the only real
[62:51] people that make actual money with a
[62:54] sustainable business model
[62:56] uh with with trading all the other
[62:59] people just trying to to get a little
[63:02] bit more but then they have a down year
[63:04] and they lose everything again so uh
[63:08] look at look at the richest 500 people
[63:10] list and they no traders in there there
[63:13] are builders in there there are people
[63:14] that actually uh did something and the
[63:20] the most the best trade you can make is
[63:22] just holding
[63:24] Bitcoin exactly I I worked my ass off
[63:27] the whole year I founded this whole
[63:29] Bitcoin Media company I was extremely
[63:32] successful with it but I didn't even
[63:34] make a fraction of what I uh made with
[63:39] just holding Bitcoin with just my
[63:41] Bitcoin stack uh measured in uh US
[63:44] dollar outperformed all my income that
[63:48] that I made with the podcast uh so uh
[63:52] tra trading that trading your the
[63:56] scarcest asset the scarcest money ever
[63:59] is the stupidest thing I ever heard I I
[64:03] I I don't know how people like oh yeah I
[64:05] I did all the research I know what
[64:07] Bitcoin is and now I'm GNA sell it like
[64:11] no you didn't get
[64:14] it you didn't get it yeah it's it's it's
[64:18] really really weird uh like sometimes we
[64:22] get yeah trading I IEM
[64:26] I I don't going to say it's a scam
[64:29] because some people might get money out
[64:31] of it and some people won't like I do
[64:33] believe that Bitcoin like the Bitcoin
[64:35] Market or crypto Market all the
[64:37] cryptocurrencies combined I think we're
[64:40] going to get like 80% Bitcoin dominance
[64:43] and then we're gonna end up with 10 20%
[64:45] of shitcoins or whatever like a just a
[64:49] circus of people just trying to just
[64:51] multiply Bitcoin but for example one
[64:55] thing that
[64:56] with like Krypto that sometimes people
[64:58] say hey you're so hard sometimes you're
[65:00] Bitcoin Maxes and whatever well the
[65:04] thing with my point is I don't mind if
[65:08] you use uh shitcoins or any other
[65:11] altcoin as long as you recognize that
[65:14] Bitcoin is
[65:16] superior I'm a Bitcoin Maxi for that I
[65:18] don't know but what I mean is Bitcoin
[65:23] is like if you if you just make a
[65:26] timeline for the human history you're
[65:28] going to have some inventions there you
[65:30] probably have the wheel the internet and
[65:33] Bitcoin in that timeline like that human
[65:36] timeline you're gonna you're gonna got
[65:38] those inventions like human inventions
[65:41] that actually change all the
[65:43] civilization you're G to just write it
[65:44] down in history books okay Netflix is
[65:48] not going to be there Spotify will not
[65:50] be there ethereum and Solana and
[65:53] whatever the [ __ ] comes next will not be
[65:55] there there I'm sorry so the the
[65:57] difference is you could use that that
[66:00] tools but if you put those tools in the
[66:04] same place that you put like you know
[66:07] Google drive or any other service that
[66:09] just actually work Google Maps or maybe
[66:12] Riverside or whatever service that you
[66:15] you're using for a specific purpose as a
[66:18] utility I don't mind if you use usct if
[66:21] you have something that actually works
[66:23] I'm not going to go against you that the
[66:26] sometimes i' I I talk with Bitcoin Maxis
[66:28] and they say no [ __ ] everything they're
[66:30] just like no no no it's okay if they
[66:33] just if they say Okay USD just fills the
[66:36] purpose right now or any other service
[66:39] if you consider them just Services it's
[66:42] okay what are you going to do with
[66:43] Instagram you're going to down you're
[66:44] going to just delete Instagram YouTube
[66:46] any other service no if you consider
[66:48] them as service that provides some some
[66:52] value for you it's okay I got a problem
[66:56] when people just come by and think for
[66:59] example that Dogecoin is going to take
[67:01] over Bitcoin because Elon Musk we're
[67:03] gonna just send a rocket with Doge you
[67:06] know that
[67:08] sorry they think that doge is gonna to
[67:12] going to the Moon because the Elon is
[67:14] actually gonna build a rocket with Doge
[67:17] painted that's insane and and and it's
[67:19] it's so crazy because elen is on record
[67:23] saying that he has significantly more
[67:25] Bitcoin than Dogecoin uh he said like I
[67:28] think 10x more Bitcoin than Dogecoin and
[67:32] uh with Tesla with spasic with all his
[67:34] companies he only ever bought Bitcoin
[67:36] and never anything else so e musk is a
[67:40] is a case where I have to say watch what
[67:43] he's doing and not what he's saying
[67:45] because he's talking about Dogecoin and
[67:48] buying Bitcoin because he's not an
[67:50] [Laughter]
[67:52] idiot but like I have this conversation
[67:55] the other day I was like are you serious
[67:58] this guy came along with 20K
[68:00] 20K US dollars worth of Dogecoin and
[68:04] people do believe that and people are
[68:06] just buying meme coins and they think
[68:09] they GNA just uh like what are you
[68:13] saying like are you honest are you are
[68:16] you listening to you and some people
[68:18] they say as you said like no I do I did
[68:20] my research I'm a bitcoiner and what I
[68:23] say sometimes is you know know having
[68:26] Bitcoin doesn't make you a bitcoiner if
[68:29] you have a bunch of a little bit of STS
[68:31] there's I don't know binance or whatever
[68:33] you're not a bitcoiner you're not for me
[68:36] maybe I'm a a little bit radical but for
[68:39] me to be a bitcoiner you have to be a
[68:41] Libertarian I'm sorry because you need
[68:43] to just know that the that the
[68:45] government is a problem that the
[68:47] government is the worst enemy that the
[68:48] government has a lot of power and the
[68:50] government is the one that has fear
[68:51] currencies is is the one that invented
[68:54] the [ __ ] is the one that's pushing for
[68:55] this shitcoin Pony so you you need to to
[69:00] know what what is capable of like you
[69:03] need to know that and if you don't know
[69:06] that you probably end up with different
[69:08] things because like you you not going to
[69:10] value that and when the when the things
[69:14] might get worse because now I think we
[69:17] didn't started the Bitcoin battle yet I
[69:20] think with the ETFs and like the Bitcoin
[69:22] is just in the same bet at the fiia
[69:25] system you know I think it might be a
[69:28] problem then I don't know what can
[69:29] happen then I don't like of course
[69:32] numbers go up that's a good thing yeah
[69:36] perfect but we need to be vigilant that
[69:41] Bitcoin is not taking over for I don't
[69:43] know uh the the miners or the pools or
[69:47] maybe they just start buying on just
[69:49] taking a lot and we might get a a
[69:53] 51% uh and and I don't mean a 51%
[69:57] attack uh like well reverse a
[70:00] transaction double spend I don't think
[70:02] the 51% uh is is that I do believe that
[70:06] if they just push really hard on trying
[70:08] to get Bitcoin as they are doing now and
[70:10] the governments were going to get in
[70:13] they're going to start just uh accessing
[70:16] the the pools and maybe there are some
[70:18] transactions that you're not going to be
[70:20] able to do and maybe they're going to
[70:23] have a like majority of the of the minor
[70:28] transactions and you're going to get
[70:30] your you're going to need some
[70:32] permission or you need to just have a wh
[70:35] list or something it's not that I think
[70:37] it's going to happen what I mean is like
[70:39] you need you need to be
[70:41] vigilant like I think that's not going
[70:43] to happen because the Bitcoin Community
[70:45] is hard it's hard enough to fight
[70:48] against that and just point that out and
[70:50] start doing stuff about it and know how
[70:52] to do just Mak transactions or whatever
[70:55] to not be able to just you truck down
[70:58] things but we got these enemies inside
[71:00] like chain an chain analysis or any
[71:02] other things to truck transactions so to
[71:06] be able to to just fight that back you
[71:08] need a strong Community with values
[71:11] that's the thing that crypto people
[71:12] don't have they don't matter about that
[71:16] if that happens and they say okay now if
[71:18] the government takes and okay we're
[71:20] going to be better because regulation is
[71:23] good no I think it's
[71:25] it might be like I don't know what what
[71:28] you think about that that point yeah
[71:31] it's an interesting point and um you you
[71:34] can tell that crypto people are actually
[71:37] afraid of uh regulations um especially
[71:42] when Gary gansler tried to um go go
[71:46] against uh Bitcoin but also uh against
[71:51] crypto people a lot of crypto people
[71:53] were like oh like what is he doing and
[71:55] stuff like Bitcoin is also but bitco
[71:57] Bitcoin is like we don't we don't really
[71:59] care like Gary GZA cannot turn off
[72:01] Bitcoin he can maybe postpone the
[72:04] Bitcoin ETF and now it's here anyways um
[72:07] but it's it's not not possible and I
[72:10] feel like when you talk with altcoin
[72:12] people they really fear the regulation
[72:16] and that's I think one reason because
[72:19] they all know if a big government really
[72:22] wants to they can shut down all the
[72:24] altcoin
[72:26] like if the US government picks out like
[72:30] oh let's see Solana okay who's
[72:33] responsible those four people let's turn
[72:35] it off it's done
[72:37] tomorrow it's it's not decentralized
[72:40] like you you can turn off all coins if
[72:43] the government if if China if if if the
[72:46] USA if if any big uh government really
[72:50] wants to they can turn those things off
[72:53] because it's not decentralized Bitcoin
[72:55] you cannot turn off like there there's
[72:57] not like oh let's let's let's let's
[73:00] visit that one guy and then he will turn
[73:03] off the servers and that's done like and
[73:05] that's where I think over the long run
[73:10] the only out coins that will survive are
[73:13] coins that are issued from governments
[73:15] or are connected with governments and
[73:18] government approved so for example
[73:20] stable coins uh as long as the
[73:23] government approves of them
[73:26] uh they will be
[73:27] here because the government likes them
[73:30] uh and they can control them and they
[73:31] can have influence in them and the
[73:33] government is like yeah let's do that
[73:35] people think they're free and we have
[73:37] the control why not uh but uh in the
[73:42] long run all Al coins will die
[73:44] eventually either because of free market
[73:46] or because the government will shut them
[73:48] down uh and the only thing that will
[73:50] survive is altcoins that are approved of
[73:55] governments or maybe even like uh from
[73:58] the government to a certain extent I
[74:00] always hear about yeah Ripple and it
[74:02] will be used by government like yeah you
[74:05] should not sheer for that
[74:07] like like who who who holds Ripple that
[74:11] now I I I sometimes I say is this thing
[74:14] still going on do they have an someone
[74:17] just backing this [ __ ] I have no clue
[74:21] like I I don't research altcoins very
[74:25] deeply I did back in the day and then I
[74:29] was researching oh is there maybe
[74:31] something is that because nothing works
[74:34] if it's not
[74:35] decentralized what what we are trying to
[74:37] accomplish it needs to be fully
[74:40] decentralized it needs to be fully out
[74:42] of the control of the government
[74:44] otherwise it will not work and so
[74:47] Bitcoin is the only one that um checks
[74:50] that point uh and even Bitcoin is not
[74:52] perfect I feel my mining pool
[74:55] centralization uh and we have to address
[74:58] that and we have to get more pools and
[74:59] we have to do something for the for the
[75:03] template creation of mining pools uh to
[75:06] get to really be censorship resistance
[75:08] so even Bitcoin is not at 100%
[75:11] decentralization but it's the best thing
[75:13] that we have by far and the most best
[75:16] thing that we have and it's not able to
[75:18] be turned off uh in an instant from the
[75:21] government it it seems like government's
[75:24] more
[75:25] actually want to adopt it and wants to
[75:28] uh be in Bitcoin now we have to we have
[75:32] a French Parliament member of the EU uh
[75:35] now talking about a national uh Bitcoin
[75:38] Reserve strategic Bitcoin reserve on EU
[75:41] level I think like two days ago we had
[75:43] also one day ago the German Finance
[75:46] Minister saying why why are we not
[75:49] adopting Bitcoin we we should do that so
[75:52] like with America going first with
[75:56] Argentina doing that with with El Salva
[75:59] do being since three years now uh fully
[76:03] bullish on on on bitcoin I think we will
[76:06] see countries actually embracing Bitcoin
[76:09] in the next 10 years I think but one
[76:13] cave I want to to mention here I don't
[76:16] like when countri byy
[76:18] Bitcoin I I I want individuals to buy
[76:21] Bitcoin exactly I do yeah exactly the
[76:24] same thing uh uh I would prefer that
[76:26] individuals do it first uh of course for
[76:29] money like numbers go up yeah definitely
[76:34] I do believe you say just 10 years I I
[76:36] think it's going to go up in like when
[76:40] when Trump comes in uh and just put it a
[76:44] a reserve strategic Reserve yeah
[76:46] everybody every other country come along
[76:49] and become might Skyrocket like we never
[76:52] seen
[76:53] before um but yeah the thing is uh
[76:57] that's why I always try to mention the
[76:59] the community part the mo the movement
[77:01] the bigco movement the bitco as a
[77:04] movement h no no not not just a
[77:06] technology it's a movement because it's
[77:09] the movement that like the the
[77:10] technology is just a way to just figure
[77:13] this out it's a way of solving the
[77:15] problem like some some people say oh
[77:17] what would happen if I don't know
[77:18] something happen with Bitcoin or
[77:20] whatever the back whatever something
[77:22] that breaks it down so do you think like
[77:26] I would just stop fighting do you think
[77:28] that I going to be okay so you think
[77:30] most of we people are going to just say
[77:33] okay we we we lost no we're g to start
[77:36] over I'm better I'm better and the thing
[77:39] is this is a is a war so we we're gonna
[77:43] just make it again we're gonna make it
[77:45] again and better because that's the
[77:47] thing we're are not we're never be we we
[77:51] it's like I think that's the the Bitcoin
[77:53] spirit that is strong
[77:55] we we're not going to give up and that's
[77:58] the biggest difference between Bitcoin
[78:00] and crypto and altcoin people what the
[78:03] first one would be we don't sell it's
[78:06] not that we are expecting a price and
[78:08] say okay when this Reach This price I'm
[78:10] gonna sell no maybe you can just I don't
[78:12] know maybe just take a little bit of it
[78:14] and convert it into your Dreamhouse or
[78:18] whatever but it's not that you're just
[78:20] trying to say okay in this price i g to
[78:22] convert it back to Fiat no never and the
[78:26] difference with that's a very big
[78:27] difference between bitcoiners and ALT
[78:30] coiners alt coiners they are maybe
[78:32] they're in ethereum they just call it
[78:34] ultrasound money or whatever the [ __ ]
[78:36] they are saying but they have a price I
[78:39] I'm pretty sure they have a price where
[78:41] they just exit and they are not sure if
[78:44] it's ethereum or maybe if ethereum
[78:46] doesn't work they go with Solana or any
[78:48] other thing that goes popular so uh
[78:52] bitcoiners were not selling we already
[78:55] sold we already make the exit made the
[78:57] exit and then we are just committed to
[79:00] this kind of fight like uh this kind of
[79:03] podcast for example we are just really
[79:05] passionate about it we really believe
[79:07] about changing the world we really
[79:09] believe in this so it's not just a
[79:11] technology for us that's what what I
[79:14] mean when I see the when I say this is
[79:16] it's not just a technology it's a
[79:19] movement and that's the thing it's it
[79:22] needs to be said of course I think in
[79:24] conferences as well where they just mix
[79:27] it with blockchain and they just say
[79:28] Bitcoin blockchain and then just when
[79:31] you open the door of blockchain it's
[79:32] like what do you mean that blockchain
[79:35] I'm going to come back with the thing
[79:37] you said about lightning Network so if
[79:39] you go to Al coiners like most of bit of
[79:43] crypto currencies any other they just
[79:46] put blockchain to anything to everything
[79:48] like when they just run out of space and
[79:51] the feast goes up they just create
[79:53] another blockchain as ler two it's just
[79:55] another blockchain and then later three
[79:57] and then you have multiple blockchains
[79:59] so you have a problem no worries you
[80:00] just build another blockchain to just
[80:02] make a roll up or cync or whatever you
[80:05] say but it's always the same solution
[80:07] for the problem you just create another
[80:09] blockchain with same evm that is
[80:11] compatible with all the rest that's
[80:14] that's all you got create another
[80:15] blockchain that's that's the biggest
[80:18] problem about the biggest problem about
[80:20] doing that is that when fees go up and
[80:24] you need to create another blockchain
[80:25] you need to move all your users and
[80:27] again it's not a technological thing
[80:29] it's that Network effect what is
[80:31] valuable if it was just the technology
[80:35] you could just clone Bitcoin and that's
[80:36] it you have the same value no it's not
[80:38] it's not the technology it's the it's
[80:40] the network effect as well so every time
[80:43] you just create another layer and just
[80:46] move the users back to another layer say
[80:48] hey guys we are now here you get the
[80:50] liquidity you get the apps you get your
[80:52] your users just move them to ACH cheaper
[80:55] place you just break down the network
[80:58] effect some people might get behind and
[81:00] some people might say okay now I'm going
[81:02] to go to cardano or whatever and then
[81:05] when the Fe goes down people go back and
[81:07] just people they are all Nomads you know
[81:09] the crypto Nomads just going anywhere
[81:12] they don't give a [ __ ] about the the the
[81:15] the specific blockchain they just move
[81:17] they have the the the funds with usdt or
[81:20] whatever they just move back to another
[81:21] blockchain so in Bitcoin we do things we
[81:26] do
[81:27] things uh differently it's not that we
[81:30] put blockchain to everything of course
[81:31] we got layer toos any like Drive chains
[81:34] or side chains whatever we have
[81:37] lightning lightning is able to scale
[81:40] without the need of having another
[81:43] blockchain actually is so smart that
[81:47] when you have the more users the more
[81:50] notes the more channels you do have the
[81:54] better
[81:55] works you know it's not that like you
[81:59] don't have a problem with that you
[82:01] actually have a very good scaling
[82:03] solution you just scale to kind of I
[82:07] don't mean Infinity but you can get a
[82:09] like millions of users and you don't get
[82:12] more fees actually it's more efficient
[82:14] so we got this things solve solve and
[82:17] the other crypto bullsh people that they
[82:19] are able to just bend the rules create
[82:21] modify them as they please even with
[82:24] with that they are not able to solve a
[82:26] single problem or just lowering the
[82:28] transaction fees and the speed of
[82:30] transactions they can't so Bitcoin
[82:34] Superior in everywhere in every way we
[82:36] are able to just send a microsat a
[82:41] millat you can send just instantly
[82:44] anywhere in the world for nothing
[82:46] nothing of fees and you are able to just
[82:49] send um 10,000
[82:52] Bitcoins the other part of the world
[82:54] with the just $2 of fees and and wait 10
[82:57] minutes we already got that solve out we
[83:00] have reserve of value you already got
[83:02] that and you have medium of exchange
[83:04] you're able to transact those things
[83:06] small tiny micro and just large as [ __ ]
[83:10] we going like Bitcoin just is superior
[83:14] we already just won in that sense in
[83:15] every sense that's uh that's that's
[83:18] great yeah and it turned out that we
[83:20] talk about Bitcoin in anyways now
[83:24] [Music]
[83:26] it's it's impossible to not talk about
[83:28] Bitcoin actually really cool H but yeah
[83:31] the thing that you said in in the in the
[83:33] beginning and I know we already kind of
[83:35] in the end but uh if you have still a
[83:37] few minutes uh I think that it was
[83:40] really interesting what you said uh that
[83:43] once all the countries come in once the
[83:45] things that uh get get moving that law
[83:50] of diminishing returns is BS I think uh
[83:54] because we are now at like what 1%
[83:57] adoption 2% adoption maybe uh and once
[84:00] the snowball really gets going and the
[84:04] the this nation state formal individual
[84:06] formal Corporation form is getting
[84:09] started and it didn't get started till
[84:11] now like we we we don't see anything
[84:13] till now that we're now above 100K and I
[84:16] think like I saw it 180k even
[84:18] yesterday um that's nothing that's
[84:22] nothing of of what become so this
[84:23] diminish returns that that's BS like
[84:26] we're
[84:27] going I I really think the next 5 10
[84:31] years will be uh completely surprising
[84:34] for everyone even bitcoiners we be like
[84:37] oh like what that
[84:40] happened and you and you know you know
[84:44] yeah this is um no it's gonna I think
[84:47] it's going to go to the
[84:48] Moon um I don't I don't know if I want
[84:52] to Res the prise but the thing is
[84:55] um yes it's weird because we actually
[84:58] get used to that like you know even
[85:00] though we we've we've seen I've seen
[85:03] personally seen Bitcoin Rose like
[85:07] 5,000
[85:09] times uh I still sometimes when I feel
[85:12] the price I still think it linearly you
[85:15] know oh it might be just one price but
[85:18] once you get like 100k for example the
[85:21] bitco are chill it's not that oh I like
[85:24] no we are just okay what's the next
[85:26] Target and and it's like and once it
[85:30] gets like uh increasing nobody gets
[85:32] surprised if you just like take the the
[85:35] ticket right now and it's 120 okay okay
[85:40] and then it goes from that point up and
[85:43] and it's like it goes forever up I think
[85:45] it's GNA go forever up and the thing is
[85:48] with with that bias is there's going to
[85:50] be a point that well I think it's
[85:52] dangerous right now you're losing money
[85:54] if you don't have any Bitcoin I think
[85:56] you're losing money if you don't value
[85:58] your wealth in Bitcoin you need that
[86:01] would be the start just measure all your
[86:03] wealth in Bitcoin that's the thing you
[86:06] need to do the most so uh even if you
[86:10] have a house or whatever just take into
[86:13] account that you're paying to have that
[86:16] kind of house so if if it's your
[86:18] Dreamhouse and you're with your children
[86:21] well you need to take into account that
[86:23] you're losing Bitcoin
[86:25] because if you value all that house that
[86:26] property in Bitcoin and you end up like
[86:29] two three or four years and you
[86:31] got I don't know 40% of Bitcoin just
[86:34] measure that that's the cost of living
[86:36] in that house you need to know that you
[86:39] need to measure your wealth in Bitcoin
[86:42] that's the correct way of measuring
[86:43] Things Not dollar anymore just measuring
[86:46] SATs and that's the thing that that I
[86:49] think when we switch that kind of
[86:51] mindset we not only we just switch to
[86:54] Low Time preference but also we got just
[86:56] make better decisions because you just
[86:59] use your energy
[87:01] wisely I 100% agree with you here uh and
[87:06] I think using Bitcoin as a unit of
[87:08] account is an absolute uh
[87:11] superpower uh and it but it can be
[87:14] frustrating for people if they measure
[87:17] their revenue and their salaries in
[87:19] Bitcoin and see it constantly going down
[87:22] like it it should motivate you and not
[87:24] depress you that that that that's for
[87:27] sure well some sometimes uh like um who
[87:33] I can't remember who said this but yeah
[87:35] like Bitcoin if you got like last 10
[87:37] years it has an increase of 65% annually
[87:42] average on
[87:44] average um probably more right now and
[87:47] the thing is that doesn't mean you can't
[87:50] do startups or just create your own
[87:53] business if that sometimes creating
[87:55] business is the is the whole purpose of
[87:57] the thing sometimes you just don't make
[87:59] a profit in Bitcoin sometimes the thing
[88:01] you matter the most is okay I like doing
[88:04] this maybe it's maybe it it won't it's
[88:08] not better than just uh holding Bitcoin
[88:12] but definitely more fun because there's
[88:14] no much fun of holding Bitcoin you know
[88:17] sometimes you need to just create your
[88:18] own thing and it's much better and well
[88:23] that's the thing everybody should choose
[88:25] how they spend their time and energy
[88:28] some is stored and some is actually
[88:30] alive you spend your own time and
[88:32] sometimes you spend the time you already
[88:35] you already used and stored sometimes
[88:37] that so may maybe it's it's a different
[88:39] way I know what you mean sometimes it
[88:41] might be frustrating if you say okay I'm
[88:43] losing money like doing any business or
[88:46] whatever just investing in your own
[88:48] business but I think it's just a
[88:50] personal thing a personal
[88:52] evaluation the the question becomes uh
[88:55] do you do you want to
[88:57] see your unit of account uh
[89:02] decreasing like if if we say okay you
[89:05] have dollars uh would would you rather
[89:07] have more dollar salary every year but
[89:10] you can't but you can buy less things
[89:13] with that dollar salary or would you
[89:15] have a Bitcoin salary where the Bitcoin
[89:17] salary is going down but you can
[89:18] actually buy more things with that than
[89:22] than the US dollar salary so like
[89:24] um it will be hard that switch on a
[89:28] global level uh where we have all of a
[89:32] sudden uh discussions of like oh I'm
[89:35] sorry we have to lower your salary this
[89:38] year um or we cannot give you a raise or
[89:41] like but with the with the lower raise
[89:44] you can actually buy more and now we
[89:46] have the the the situation where you get
[89:49] a higher rise but you can afford
[89:52] less uh and
[89:54] and I don't care about the nominal unit
[89:56] thing I want to increase my purchasing
[89:59] power ex not the
[90:02] nominal exactly that's the thing that
[90:05] that matter the most we we as
[90:07] argentinians we we got that thing very
[90:10] clearly like people everybody just
[90:12] suddenly became millionaire in in pesos
[90:17] like we actually used the term
[90:19] millionaire and it made sense for for a
[90:22] while but then everybody every salary
[90:24] everybody just uh earns Millions you
[90:28] know we actually just have a a party we
[90:30] celebrated one set one peso like
[90:33] actually one sat
[90:35] became we have a a website it's called
[90:38] one satoshi1 p.r i we were tracking the
[90:41] the Satoshi against the peso Satoshi
[90:44] just turned over that like that it's
[90:46] insane it's insane like the Bitcoin atom
[90:50] it nobody just talk about s in the in
[90:54] just back five years six years ago no
[90:57] nobody measured that in SATs and now the
[91:00] SAT is able to just take over the peso
[91:03] this was a big milestone achievement I
[91:05] hope it does the same thing to the US
[91:09] dollar it it will it will probably not
[91:11] tomorrow but it will perfect uh thank
[91:15] you so much uh Austine uh for for being
[91:19] on the on on the show I have one
[91:21] question that each and every one of my
[91:22] guests get and the question question is
[91:24] what can we learn from you besides
[91:26] Bitcoin well uh I think uh I like I am a
[91:32] programmer myself and I do like to to
[91:37] create I I really develop things open
[91:40] source uh development so if people want
[91:42] to just uh come with me and just know
[91:45] how to build stuff how to just uh start
[91:48] growing start making researches uh I
[91:51] actually just I'm very good at creating
[91:54] the biggest Bitcoin community in
[91:55] Argentina so maybe I just if someone is
[91:58] anywhere in the world and wants to build
[92:00] a community I already did this here so
[92:03] if you want to just approach me you I
[92:05] can like give you some tips on how to to
[92:09] get that
[92:10] rolling really interesting cool uh
[92:13] perfect and thank you so much uh for
[92:15] that we have another end rtin where the
[92:17] previous guest is asking a question for
[92:18] the next guest without knowing who the
[92:20] next guest is and the next gu next
[92:22] question uh from the previous guest is
[92:25] 20 years from today how will Bitcoin
[92:28] have changed the global political
[92:31] landscape well that's uh 20 years good
[92:36] question um
[92:39] hopefully uh 20 years I do believe that
[92:42] Bitcoin will all take over or die but
[92:47] anyway I would say I would say just
[92:49] Bitcoin
[92:50] movement um I would think that we we in
[92:54] 20 years I think we'll be in some kind
[92:57] of Bitcoin standard uh we do we
[93:00] definitely we we would never have this
[93:02] the this question about is it just uh
[93:05] like magic internet money fake money of
[93:07] nerds no of course no everybody would
[93:09] know about Bitcoin everybody will be
[93:11] just store their money their wealth
[93:13] their energy in Bitcoin there you're
[93:16] gonna have some countries still
[93:18] countries with fiat currency of course
[93:20] fiat currency is not never going to die
[93:22] because you're gonna just reinvent
[93:24] itself just having Bitcoin at the back
[93:27] and just taking the Bitcoin out of
[93:29] people they're going to do that lot of
[93:32] times in the future so I do believe that
[93:35] uh hopefully with that kind of limit in
[93:38] the government the government will not
[93:40] be able to spend what they don't have so
[93:44] I think we're gonna like I have I am
[93:47] very positive like I'm optimistic on the
[93:50] future in 20 years much better than than
[93:53] than we are today
[93:54] like the governments will have to
[93:55] restrain themselves and people are going
[93:57] to have a personal responsibility and
[93:59] sovereignty with Bitcoin one 100% I
[94:02] agree with that thank you so much uh
