[00:00] If you don't have opportunity to change
[00:02] directly from the top, what are you
[00:04] going to do? So, if you discover
[00:05] Bitcoin, you have no other option but to
[00:06] opt in, it's already a disadvantage
[00:08] opportunity. And I'm talking about my
[00:09] own country, Nigeria, which is most
[00:11] likely even better than some African
[00:12] countries, right? We have a large
[00:13] economy that if you produce anything,
[00:15] almost all the Bitcoin companies on
[00:16] earth have large numbers of Nigerian
[00:18] user base except they don't want to be
[00:20] sincere. I can buy my domain name. I can
[00:22] buy my hosting plan and quickly set up
[00:24] everything. Today in Nigeria I can send
[00:26] money to my brother anywhere, my father,
[00:28] my family, anywhere across Africa and
[00:30] they can cash it out. Ordinarily that
[00:32] can't happen. So tell me what are we
[00:34] going to do? Rely on our naira that is
[00:36] our money that we are so proud of
[00:38] because we are citizens of this country
[00:40] but doesn't do anything much for us has
[00:42] less value. The more the paper that you
[00:44] have the lesser the value that the
[00:46] values every day it's only natural. I
[00:48] don't have to be the one to say it's
[00:50] only natural for you to opt out of such
[00:52] system. People want to get better. So if
[00:54] you stack and hle, I wish you all the
[00:56] best. I also stack and hudo too. But you
[00:58] see where the fun is for me? I can send
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] swoosh. What do you actually see in in
[01:07] in in Africa where how fear impacts
[01:11] their life and maybe then also how
[01:14] Bitcoin changes their lives once they
[01:17] discover Bitcoin.
[01:19] Interesting. you know um in in Nigeria
[01:23] in Africa our fiat has been bastardized
[01:27] you can you must have I don't have to
[01:29] reinvent the wheel you you must have
[01:30] read stories even a lot of people have
[01:33] made money off writing about our stories
[01:36] um stories of how the west have milked
[01:39] Africa's resources and you know uh
[01:42] giving them crumbs back in terms of um
[01:45] backing your money by you know foreign
[01:47] currencies for example franophone Africa
[01:49] you see what is happening over there.
[01:51] What France has done to their economy uh
[01:53] and their currencies and of course look
[01:55] at our country Nigeria largely
[01:57] everything is about the US dollar which
[01:58] is not supposed to be you know which is
[02:00] one of the reasons why I supported the
[02:01] the NRA stable coin right I'm I'm not a
[02:04] fan but I I support it because anything
[02:07] that is going to make our country's
[02:08] currency be interoperable on the chain
[02:10] and move around uh without it being a
[02:13] central bank digital currency by the
[02:15] central bank good so ordinarily anywhere
[02:18] you are whether you are in Africa or
[02:19] elsewhere
[02:20] If you are living on the under
[02:23] the authoritarian leadership of the type
[02:26] of people that we have that are very
[02:27] corrupt uh if you're living where
[02:30] inflation is pretty much about 30 35 40%
[02:34] look at what is happening in Zimbabwe is
[02:36] a terrible world. They have one note,
[02:37] billions, one paper note in billions of
[02:41] dollars and can't do nothing. Most
[02:42] likely can't even buy you a gold chain,
[02:44] you know. Uh and Nigeria here uh our
[02:46] inflation just got rebased from 35% to
[02:48] 24%. It doesn't mean that inflation is
[02:50] down. It just mean that the base year
[02:53] and the reference year has been changed.
[02:54] Base year is now 2024. Uh reference year
[02:57] is now 2025. Inflation repays from 34%
[03:00] to uh 25 uh to 24%. you know and CRR is
[03:06] 50%. That's the largest in the world in
[03:08] the entire world. You can't find that
[03:10] anywhere in the world. How do you want
[03:11] to grow your economy? Even though the
[03:12] motive is nice, but implementation and
[03:14] the timing is wrong. When you have an
[03:17] economy that is
[03:19] um largely dependent on not oil, I'm not
[03:23] and I'm not talking about uh the
[03:25] Nigerian government. I'm talking about
[03:26] the Nigerian people. They largely depend
[03:28] on the non-o sector, you know, the
[03:30] digital sector. uh entrepreneurs just
[03:32] try to create things you know by
[03:35] themselves. No power, no uh bad road,
[03:40] transportation is ineffective. You know
[03:42] the incentives to grow as a young
[03:44] entrepreneur is not um it's not
[03:47] motivational and then you can't even go
[03:49] to the bank because CR is 50%. That's
[03:51] cash reserve ratio and then the money
[03:54] policy rate the interest rate is
[03:57] 27%. How do you want to grow? How do you
[04:00] want to implement the uh micasilla
[04:03] borrow borrow chip dollar model for
[04:06] Bitcoin when you're going to be when the
[04:08] central bank is already telling you that
[04:10] the uh MPR is 27%. How much do you think
[04:14] the MFBs will give the the loan out? How
[04:17] much would Finex give the loan out? Most
[04:20] likely 30 35 40%. So it's already a
[04:24] disadvantage opportunity. And I'm
[04:25] talking about my own country Nigeria
[04:26] which is most likely even better than
[04:27] some African countries, right? We have a
[04:29] large economy that if you produce
[04:30] anything you will succeed. That is why
[04:32] you see Bitcoin companies you know and
[04:34]  companies coming into our country.
[04:35] We have the numbers almost all the
[04:36] Bitcoin companies on earth have large
[04:39] numbers of Nigerian user base except
[04:41] they don't want to be sincere you know
[04:43] uh so mention them all of them have
[04:45] large number of Nigerian user base but
[04:47] unfortunately they come through the back
[04:49] door um and then when they get clamped
[04:51] down by the SEC everybody shouts and
[04:52] complain but you know so it's natural
[04:54] for you to want to emancipate yourself
[04:56] from this financial slavery. it's only
[04:59] natural for you to want to um take
[05:01] yourself out of the the bondage of um uh
[05:06] inflation. You want to opt out. So
[05:09] people get involved in anything that
[05:11] will give them opportunity positively.
[05:13] But sadly, almost everything you invest
[05:17] in still will will will
[05:21] will bind you within the inflationary
[05:24] economy. Whether it is real estate, it's
[05:26] a bond, it's useless gold. We already
[05:29] know what it is. They keep discovering
[05:30] gold here and there. It's plated. It's
[05:32] not real. Uh you don't even know where
[05:34] the gold are. If Fort Knox can't really
[05:38] tell us what is in there and and Donald
[05:40] Trump has not come up with that u that
[05:44] check dodged by the US government led by
[05:47] Ellen Musk have not been able to fulfill
[05:49] that because they know if they expose
[05:51] that it's going to be trouble for the US
[05:52] dollar faster trouble and then the bank
[05:54] of England have messed up what do you
[05:56] think Africa uh would do you know so and
[05:59] those are the people that took advantage
[06:00] of people's gold right those are the
[06:02] leaders of the world economy so even
[06:04] Africa
[06:05] that owns the gold the most, you know,
[06:08] can't really mine their gold um uh uh
[06:13] satisfactorily. All the powers, you
[06:15] know, have been signed to the
[06:18] colonizers. So, if you don't have
[06:21] opportunity to change directly from the
[06:23] top, what are you going to do? All the
[06:26] options still uh put you in there. You
[06:29] keep rolling around in circles. So if
[06:32] you discover Bitcoin, you have you have
[06:33] no other option but to opt in. And and
[06:35] for me, my experience, I bought Bitcoin
[06:38] in 2013. I didn't know what it was. They
[06:40] didn't orange peel me, right? It was
[06:41] just a poor um um uh it was a poor
[06:47] introduction that the person did to me.
[06:48] I just liked it. I felt it was a money
[06:50] go up thing. But you know, uh in 2016, I
[06:53] sold it cuz I thought it was MM. You can
[06:56] go and read about the Ponzi in Nigeria.
[06:58] Mm. It was a Russian powered Ponzi. I
[07:01] tell people, look, you say Nigeria is
[07:02] corrupt, Nigeria is this, Nigeria,
[07:03] they're scammers. That's a fat lie.
[07:05] Americans are biggest scammers. You
[07:07] know, Europians are biggest scammers.
[07:09] The Asians are biggest scammers. And if
[07:11] you look at the format of all the things
[07:12] that some of this tiny number of
[07:14] Nigerians are, bad Nigerians have
[07:16] engaged in is because they were taught
[07:18] by these people. This scam were
[07:19] introduced in our country. So, a lot of
[07:20] people fell for the scam. So, when I
[07:22] heard that this scam got busted and a
[07:24] lot of people lost money from MM, I sold
[07:26] my Bitcoin. I didn't know what it was.
[07:28] But thank god to nice of America. I was
[07:29] in New York and um I found Bitcoin again
[07:32] because Western Union had censored me.
[07:34] I've said this story over and over
[07:35] again. But let me say it every time I
[07:36] say it. I say it in a new dynamics. But
[07:38] Western Union had censored me. I was I
[07:40] had a clean visa in America. So I helped
[07:43] undocumented Nigerians and Africans send
[07:45] money back home. I was trying to send
[07:46] money back home. One time censored me.
[07:49] Uh uh so I got tired of this censorship.
[07:51] I got tired of traveling from one place
[07:53] to another. you have to go to the city
[07:54] center to send as much as a thousand
[07:56] plus because if you live inside the
[07:59] cities especially someone like me that
[08:00] was living in New York uh the outskirts
[08:03] of the city you would not be able to
[08:05] send large amount of money you know so
[08:07] you have to go to maybe like Manhattan
[08:09] you know to be able to send large amount
[08:10] of money and and Africans or or
[08:13] Nigerians who have expired visa or
[08:16] somehow have not been able to
[08:18] orchestrate their uh their their green
[08:20] card their document documentation well
[08:22] but they're just trying to survive.
[08:23] Everybody's trying to survive. Nobody
[08:24] wants to be illegal in anybody's
[08:26] country, right? You know, and then
[08:27] nobody's even doing the job that they're
[08:28] doing anyway. They go there, they
[08:30] survive, they they they get themselves
[08:33] together and they become great in the
[08:34] country. Shout out to United of America
[08:35] for giving a platform for Africans and
[08:37] Nigerians. Nigerians are one of the best
[08:39] performing immigrants in America. Go
[08:40] check them. The best doctors, the best
[08:42] lawyers are uh just go check the stats
[08:45] when it comes to immigrants. So, uh it
[08:47] became very difficult for me to send
[08:48] money for these people and delays were
[08:50] happening. I have to give money to
[08:51] somebody they have um naira back home so
[08:55] that they take the dollar bulk dollar
[08:56] and they send naira back home and then
[08:59] uh so these things uh were were delaying
[09:02] somebody that need to go to the hospital
[09:05] uh might get the money four five days
[09:07] after somebody that needs to pay for
[09:09] school fees and they've been chased out
[09:10] of school because Nigerian schools can
[09:12] chase you out of school if you don't pay
[09:13] you know people that need to just feed
[09:15] they need money for feeding it becomes a
[09:16] problem then when I was in New York in
[09:18] 2016 2017 you know you send any uh uh
[09:21] via the banks if you don't send it
[09:23] before 12:00 noon they will not get the
[09:24] money in Nigeria so most likely to get
[09:26] the money the next day so you have to
[09:27] send it very early in the morning you
[09:28] know and Western Union close you know
[09:30] most shops close except you go to the
[09:32] city center where you see maybe a
[09:33] 24-hour service I'm talking about west
[09:35] monogram so I got very tired I was
[09:37] coming from uh New York code and design
[09:39] academy that day and I saw this fella
[09:41] building with Nigerian bank uh flag
[09:43] United bank of Africa oh that's
[09:45] fantastic I walked into the place but it
[09:47] wasn't really a banking all it wasn't a
[09:49] commercial banking It was just a
[09:50] nostrils and vostros account if you
[09:52] understand what that means. Uh and
[09:54] then I said what do I do? What do I do?
[09:57] So uh you know I started reading about
[09:59] Bitcoin again and boom I started you
[10:01] know trying to stack little by little I
[10:03] realized that you can move money over
[10:05] the Bitcoin chain without any license
[10:08] without any permission permissionless
[10:10] borderless. Oh wow why do I have to go
[10:12] to Western Union? So I started pitching
[10:13] this to Nigerians and all of that. I
[10:16] came back to Nigeria. I pitched that to
[10:17] a bank that's the same bank, United Bank
[10:19] of Africa. Shout out to them. They gave
[10:20] me the platform for expression. I
[10:22] learned so much working with them. Uh uh
[10:24] the Bitcoin idea didn't scale, but we're
[10:26] able to build a remittance service using
[10:27] the Mastercard Homescent for the bank.
[10:29] It was the first ever time the the bank
[10:31] was able to do business uh for diaspora
[10:34] uh outside Western Union Money. So we
[10:36] built the diaspora banking application.
[10:38] They were the first they led the pack in
[10:39] Nigeria and Africa. uh uh but then you
[10:42] know so I said okay now I've done this
[10:45] um I got to do my own thing so because I
[10:48] learned something I didn't get any
[10:49] equity because I didn't have the
[10:50] mentorship and exposure to do that type
[10:53] of business I just got my bulk money I
[10:55] enjoyed myself traveling around the
[10:56] world and and I saw that the product
[10:58] started doing well thereafter and I felt
[10:59] very bad so I said okay I'm going to
[11:01] build my own remittance services to help
[11:03] Nigerians in diaspora remmit money back
[11:04] home you know and I'm going to use um
[11:07] Bitcoin and and and and regulated
[11:09] financial services, you know, got some
[11:11] people together. We were trying to
[11:12] involve and and you know, invest money.
[11:15] Top Nigerians, but pandemic struck.
[11:17] Boom. 2020 lockdown. We couldn't do that
[11:19] successfully. All investors pulled out.
[11:21] I told them about Bitcoin. Ah, no, we
[11:23] don't want Bitcoin. And I tried it and
[11:24] it worked and we bought me cash and we
[11:26] did transaction of $10 the first day and
[11:28] that was very awesome. Today we are now
[11:30] building trying to integrate lightning
[11:31] and and that's awesome, you know. So my
[11:34] story is basically from censorship, you
[11:35] know, to real world sens sending money
[11:37] back home for people who have the need,
[11:40] people who work hard, who have traveled
[11:42] far miles, thousands of miles just to be
[11:45] able to survive and help the family back
[11:47] home, right? And and and that was the
[11:49] like the the middle central point,
[11:52] legitimate point to help them send money
[11:53] because they don't want to get caught by
[11:54] the cops or something and and still I
[11:56] got censored by the the channel that I
[11:59] was using. Though after that my
[12:00] experience I came back to Nigeria and I
[12:02] vetted my own thing and today you don't
[12:04] even have to go through that experience
[12:05] at all. Any young Nigerian 19 20 21 can
[12:08] start up an international money transfer
[12:10] business. You don't need an IMTO for
[12:12] that. An IMTO is international money
[12:13] transfer operator. You don't need a
[12:15] license for that. It costs billions of
[12:16] naira millions of USD if you do the
[12:18] conversion. But today a 20 years old is
[12:21] doing remittance business in the corners
[12:23] of their room. you know, nobody's
[12:25] clamping them down and they're living
[12:26] well, driving in cars, building houses,
[12:29] changing their world, going to school,
[12:30] digital school, uh, physical school, you
[12:32] know, changing the life of their
[12:33] fathers, building homes for their
[12:35] parents, setting up their family
[12:36] business, and it's so beautiful. That's
[12:39] why P2P is very big in Nigeria. Go check
[12:42] all the biggest peer-to-peer companies.
[12:44] They most likely blew up with Nigerian
[12:46] uh um numbers. Even Ted, ask Paulo. He
[12:49] knows that Nigerian numbers is not a
[12:51] number to play with. you play with
[12:52] Nigerian number, you undermine your own
[12:54] business. You undermine your own um you
[12:57] just undermine your own profitability.
[12:58] So, uh Bitcoin for me is born out of the
[13:02] need. I found Bitcoin because I needed
[13:04] it at the time. And um I thank God for
[13:07] where we are today.
[13:09] That's amazing. And I have something to
[13:12] show you. I think I think that's uh
[13:14] really interesting. I I hope it's still
[13:16] true today because I I was looking at
[13:19] that
[13:20] um a few years ago and it just came into
[13:23] my mind now. Uh yeah, actually it's it's
[13:27] still still uh still true. Uh which is
[13:31] it's super fun uh to to to look at that
[13:34] uh statistic. Um you probably know of
[13:37] the of the Google trends you know uh of
[13:41] like uh we we we have Google trends and
[13:44] you can just put a search term in and
[13:46] you see uh what the interest is over
[13:49] time. There are a lot of interesting
[13:51] things in those charts but the interest
[13:54] by region is super fun uh because we
[13:56] have El Salvador at number one
[13:58] apparently in the last 5 years. Um, and
[14:02] uh, I mean, El Salvador is because like
[14:04] the the president is there and stuff
[14:06] like that. And then you're from Nigeria
[14:08] and I'm from Austria. So like we have
[14:10] basically place two and three which we
[14:13] which I don't know how Austria came up
[14:15] there honestly. Like I I have no clue
[14:17] how Austria came up there. Um, because
[14:20] yeah I don't know like I I put worldwide
[14:22] in there. it's it's past five years like
[14:25] uh web search uh I I don't know
[14:28] like in Austria the the Bitcoin thing is
[14:32] not that big but maybe it's like uh
[14:35] relative to the to the population and in
[14:38] Austria maybe there are many Bitcoiners
[14:40] I I I'm I'm really surprised by that. Uh
[14:43] but why do you think uh is
[14:46] Nigeria so on top of that? Why is the
[14:50] interest so big especially in Bitcoin?
[14:54] And it just came into my mind that that
[14:56] statistics because I always saw Nigeria
[14:58] whenever I looked in the Bitcoin chart.
[15:00] Uh no matter what I clicked, Nigeria was
[15:03] always on the top three. And you can
[15:05] play around with buy Bitcoin with other
[15:07] terms. Nigeria is always uh number one,
[15:10] number two, number three in all the
[15:12] interest charts even outside of of of
[15:15] Google.
[15:16] You know, I I kind of think that this
[15:18] this the stats is not even correct. Most
[15:21] likely maybe it's going to be Nigeria
[15:22] one, Austria 2. Not Elsa, but a shout
[15:25] out to uh the Bitcoin
[15:28] president. I'm a fan, big fan. You know,
[15:32] um I want to believe that a lot of um
[15:34] data is not collected properly even by
[15:37] Google, you know. Uh but yes, it's part
[15:40] of what I've already said. Cash ratio
[15:44] the highest in the world today.
[15:48] 50%. Money policy rate
[15:52] 27%. Inflation rebased inflation from
[15:56] 35% is 24%. And there is a budget of
[15:59] hope for 2025, right? 54 trillion. Out
[16:02] of that 54 trillion, Nigeria will still
[16:04] have to borrow maybe about uh 13
[16:07] trillion to service the the the to be
[16:10] able to finance the the budget and then
[16:15] another 8 trillion to service debt. But
[16:17] the government is still living very very
[16:21] wasteful. They buy new jets almost every
[16:23] time a new president come in. They buy
[16:26] new cars in the budget almost every new
[16:28] year. When the a governor or a political
[16:31] person is moving, the convoy is
[16:35] something else. The convoy is something
[16:37] else. It's like a parade of cars,
[16:39] showcase of cars,
[16:42] right? It's
[16:44] the
[16:46] autocratic environment that we live in
[16:49] disguised as democracy. It's
[16:52] the unhealthy economy that is blessed
[16:56] with people with high enthusiasm that
[17:00] have the willingness to succeed but
[17:03] being stifled by lack of proper and and
[17:07] requisite basic amenities like water
[17:12] power
[17:13] uh good roads you have to power yourself
[17:16] as I'm speaking there is no power and
[17:19] you know That's why I opened most of the
[17:21] windows around, right? Because I don't
[17:23] want um to turn on the generator and
[17:26] then you're going to be hearing
[17:27] background noise, right? But of course,
[17:30] my neighbor's generator on the other
[17:31] side is on. So, you might still be
[17:33] hearing background noise. You have to
[17:35] use solar, you have to use generator. I
[17:37] still connect to the grid no matter how
[17:39] wealthy you are, no matter how connected
[17:41] you are to the government. some some
[17:44] some some days ago, there was a uh a due
[17:48] diligence sess session, oversight
[17:50] session happening at the Senate uh House
[17:53] of Nigeria with between the senators and
[17:56] and the customs. The customs were being
[18:00] accused of misappropriation and they
[18:02] were there to defend their budget and
[18:04] and while they were doing that the power
[18:07] went off for a long time. It has
[18:09] happened in Nigeria before in a world
[18:11] cup session while we had people from all
[18:15] over the world playing football on the
[18:16] field and then somebody's dribbling and
[18:18] trying to go and score and then the
[18:20] light went up boom. So this our reality
[18:25] and to survive in Nigeria what's the
[18:27] minimum wage today? The minimum wage is
[18:29] 70,000 naira. They just started paying.
[18:31] Convert that to Nigeria to to the US
[18:34] dollar using the current exchange rate.
[18:37] The current exchange rate now is between
[18:38] 1,500 according to what Google will tell
[18:40] you. But on ground in the black market,
[18:42] which is the real world market, it's
[18:43] like 1,550 or 1,600. That's about 40 $45
[18:47] or $46 when it is good. Terrible, right?
[18:50] That's the minimum wage that had just
[18:52] been increased over about just less than
[18:53] a year ago. It was 30,000 naira before.
[18:56] And guess what? When it was $30,000, it
[18:58] was almost
[19:00] $200. When it was $30,000, it was almost
[19:03] $200. Today, look at where we are. So a
[19:07] a country that is blessed with milk and
[19:09] honey, a country that is blessed with
[19:11] people like myself and people ahead of
[19:13] me, great people, musicians, Afrobate
[19:16] superstars, footballers, great soccer
[19:19] players, um great persons, lawyers,
[19:23] doctors, beautiful well represented
[19:26] Nigerians, but inside our country
[19:30] economy is bad. Let's say the truth. I'm
[19:33] not saying people are not thriving.
[19:34] people are succeeding right but how many
[19:37] people are succeeding the
[19:39] NDIC right said that in so some years
[19:43] ago about four years ago 4% of Nigerians
[19:46] have less than 500,000 NRA in a bank
[19:48] that was about four years ago 500,000
[19:50] NRA was less than $500 right yeah at the
[19:53] time today are people richer or poorer
[19:56] is the economy better or
[19:59] slower 500,000 naira now is just about
[20:03] 300
[20:05] $100 a $100 is $150 and uh $300 will be
[20:09] like $450. So it's like it's like it's
[20:11] like
[20:14] $320. So Nigerians are
[20:17] living less than $300 and something
[20:20] dollar in their bank account. 90 99% of
[20:23] Nigerians. So the little
[20:26] 1% that are very wealthy or middle class
[20:31] are the only ones surviving.
[20:33] And we have a population of more than
[20:36] 220 million people. United Nation and
[20:38] World Bank says that by 2050 we would be
[20:42] 500 million people. A whooping market
[20:44] for anybody. Human capital in Nigeria is
[20:47] enormous. These young people are
[20:49] struggling going online in a fragmented
[20:53] uh with a fragmented payment system
[20:54] rails. They still try to educate
[20:56] themselves and pay for services. Why not
[20:58] Bitcoin when I can buy domain name on
[21:02] namechip with Bitcoin like this? But if
[21:05] I want to use the Nigerian payment
[21:06] rails, it's difficult. I have to fund
[21:08] fund fund fund fund fund and the money
[21:10] may not even go or they charge you
[21:11] multiple times. I have never been
[21:13] charged multiple times moving bitcoin
[21:15] over my node or moving bitcoin over any
[21:18] onchain process even over lightning that
[21:20] they say centralized. I love it. It's
[21:23] quick. I can buy my domain name. I can
[21:26] buy my hosting plan and quickly set up
[21:28] everything
[21:29] today. In Nigeria, I can send money to
[21:31] my brother anywhere, my father, my my
[21:35] family, anywhere across Africa and they
[21:38] can cash it out. Ordinarily, that can't
[21:40] happen. So tell me what are we going to
[21:43] do? Rely on our naira that is our money
[21:45] that we are so proud of because we are
[21:47] citizens of this country but doesn't do
[21:49] anything much for us has less value. The
[21:52] more the paper that you have, the lesser
[21:54] the value that the values every day.
[21:57] It's only natural. It's only natural. I
[22:00] don't have to be the one to say it. It's
[22:02] only natural for you to opt out of such
[22:04] system. People want to get better. It's
[22:07] not even about us. What about the
[22:08] Americans? Things are worse for them.
[22:10] The the US dollar has been
[22:13] shot by
[22:16] Bitcoin. Bitcoin has hijacked the US
[22:19] dollar. Bitcoin today is worth price as
[22:22] we speak. I keep saying it. I was on
[22:25] Stacy's space the other day and I'm
[22:27] asking her, you Americans, why are you
[22:29] not on the streets? Your You think
[22:31] Nigeria is your dumping ground? You
[22:32] should be on the street protesting
[22:33] against Bitcoin. Bitcoin has finished
[22:36] your currency. You should rather adopt
[22:38] Bitcoin and ask your government what is
[22:41] happening. How much was a Nike shoe some
[22:43] years ago? How much was coffee? The
[22:45] dollar is 80 something,000 to
[22:48] BTC. $1 could buy thousands of bitcoin
[22:51] before and then we are at the receiving
[22:54] end. So we should even be celebrating
[22:57] that our colonial masters of course the
[22:59] UK you know and and and other types
[23:01] alikes the people we look up to like the
[23:04] Americans you know I mean the the
[23:06] American government not the American
[23:08] people per se already are suffering from
[23:13] the magic of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has
[23:16] butchered the American dollar. So if the
[23:19] Americans are not crying and carrying
[23:21] placards, what do you expect us that our
[23:23] money is backed by the US dollar to do?
[23:26] That's why it looks like we are running
[23:28] a faster race than the Americans. That's
[23:30] why it looks like we are ready to adopt
[23:33] Bitcoin faster than the Americans. So
[23:35] you see Nigerians searching for a way
[23:37] out on such engines. They're going,
[23:39] "What can I do to get better? What is
[23:41] better than the Nigerian naira? What is
[23:43] even better than the N the American
[23:45] dollar?" Because the American dollar is
[23:46] pretty much scarce to to find. How do
[23:48] you want to find it? Except you're
[23:50] traveling abroad. You get BTA, basic
[23:53] travel allowance, and it is limited. And
[23:55] then you have to expose a lot of
[23:56] privacy. Where are you going? Who do you
[23:58] want to go and see? If you're trying to
[24:00] do business, if you're trying to pay
[24:01] somebody, who are you paying? Okay, get
[24:03] us information of that person. If I want
[24:05] to send you some money over the bank
[24:07] now, I have to tell everybody about
[24:09] Robin Sale. Your color, what you do, the
[24:13] color of your boxers.
[24:15] me exaggerating but those are the
[24:17] private information they expect me to
[24:18] provide for myself and for you in the
[24:20] name of AML in the name of due diligence
[24:22] risk management counterterrorism
[24:25] financing come
[24:27] on it's like this so it's natural it's a
[24:30] natural uh um uh evolution and it cannot
[24:34] be stopped the train has moved any
[24:37] country that does not take advantage
[24:40] shout out to America they should thank
[24:41] God for Donald Trump who has now set
[24:43] them on on the pedestal of of truth.
[24:46] They are now on on on that platform
[24:48] automated, you know, put in the cyber
[24:51] space with AI moving forward with BTC.
[24:54] They should shout out to Donald Trump
[24:56] and pray that another president don't
[24:57] come and turn it around. We are praying
[24:59] we get such type of presidency with such
[25:01] type of people around. Shout out to our
[25:03] SEC uh DJ who wrote his thesis in
[25:05] Bitcoin. But still they are stifling
[25:07] him, not letting him approve and license
[25:09] proper Bitcoin companies because the
[25:11] politicians want their businesses and
[25:12] that of their cronies to be there. So,
[25:14] it's a proper and natural thing to make
[25:17] sure that you come out of anything that
[25:19] will uh stop your economic life from
[25:22] growing or moving forward. And when you
[25:24] find Bitcoin, you will not be able to
[25:26] turn back. It's so spiritual. I love
[25:27] that. And I I made that uh discovery
[25:31] myself actually just a few weeks ago. I
[25:33] tried to or I actually did I paid one of
[25:36] my editors um no my my editor I only
[25:39] have one uh my editor in Colombia uh and
[25:43] uh we first wanted to do the Bitcoin
[25:45] payments but he prefers uh the the fiat
[25:48] one and I was like okay we can do it I
[25:50] don't care um you choose what what you
[25:52] want to get and uh we did the we did it
[25:56] live like he he was uh on on Google
[25:59] Meets I was on Google Meets and I was
[26:00] like oh I need that information and he's
[26:01] like oh I'm sending Oh, I also need that
[26:04] information. Oh, I'm sending you. Oh, I
[26:05] also need that information. You need a
[26:07] lot of information to send money across
[26:09] borders. Like a lot of that. Uh, and
[26:12] with Bitcoin, it's like, oh, like what's
[26:15] your
[26:16] address? Okay, I sent it. Oh, here's the
[26:19] transaction ID so you can see it that I
[26:21] actually send it. Oh, it's waiting for
[26:23] two confirmations. Oh, it will be there
[26:25] in like 10 minutes. So uh it's such a
[26:29] revolution and most people don't do uh
[26:34] crossborder payments like most people
[26:36] stay with the payments within their
[26:38] country because they don't have uh the
[26:40] need to to go out at least in Austria uh
[26:42] that might be different in Nigeria and
[26:45] uh anyone who has dealt with crossborder
[26:49] payments payments they know yes it is
[26:54] very very crucial that we have Bitcoin
[26:56] and and Bitcoin is already the best
[26:58] medium of exchange that we have. It's
[27:00] only the people that uh pay some
[27:02] Starbucks and they're like, "Oh, like
[27:04] Bitcoin is so bad for payments." Like,
[27:06] of course, we need the lightning and we
[27:07] need the innovation and we need the
[27:08] ecosystem for that and then this needs
[27:10] to be built. But yeah, uh sorry from
[27:14] Robin, it was funny, Robin. Thank god
[27:16] you're from Austria, so you most likely
[27:18] understand this. You you faced this
[27:21] firsthand. The fact that Bitcoin don't
[27:23] care about color. Look at you and I.
[27:25] Look at the way we're connecting. You're
[27:27] white and black, but Bitcoin don't care.
[27:29] They cut me open. They cut you open. Our
[27:31] blood remains red. Your blood don't come
[27:34] out as white. My blood don't come out as
[27:36] gray or as black. It's red. It's the
[27:39] people of the world that manipulated our
[27:41] thoughts that that that changed
[27:43] everything, colonized and centralized
[27:45] just because they want to continue to
[27:47] stay on top and impoverish people. It's
[27:49] a format that is being taught by the
[27:51] colonials even to African leadership. So
[27:54] I say these things all the time. I have
[27:56] built for one of the biggest banks in
[27:58] Nigeria in Africa. UBAS again once again
[28:02] big ups to Tony Alumu. Uh but guess
[28:04] what? Even these people who are in the
[28:08] heart of the money business are finding
[28:12] very difficult to adopt Bitcoin. Why did
[28:15] Bitcoin do so well the most under the
[28:18] peer-to-peer
[28:19] official system network system? Satoshi
[28:23] Nakamoto said Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer
[28:27] electronic cash. He didn't stop there.
[28:30] He didn't say electronic cash and stop
[28:32] there. He said electronic cash system.
[28:35] It's a
[28:36] system consensus
[28:39] mechanism. You must agree. I must agree.
[28:41] I don't have to trust you, but I can
[28:43] verify. Right? I cannot see the ledger
[28:47] of Bank of America. I cannot see the
[28:49] ledger of Wells Fargo, of Capital One,
[28:51] of HSBC when I do transaction. I can
[28:54] only see my own transaction history
[28:55] based on what they give me. And they
[28:57] charge me incessantly. The same thing to
[28:59] all Nigerian banks. But I can see every
[29:03] transaction with privacy protected cuz I
[29:05] don't want to know you. You don't want
[29:06] to know me. But I want to see that
[29:08] transactions are transparent for the
[29:10] first time in the history of the world.
[29:12] Look at the unique thing that Bitcoin
[29:15] solved. Digital scarcity.
[29:18] There was never a time on earth that you
[29:21] could send something to another person
[29:23] over the internet and you will not be
[29:25] able to retain that copy. That's what
[29:28] Bitcoin solves. People don't understand
[29:31] when Bitcoin and says every other thing
[29:33] is shitcoin. It goes to zero for me is
[29:35] beyond making money. If it's beyond
[29:38] making money for me, it is that platform
[29:41] for expression of truth.
[29:44] It is that fact that I know that truly
[29:47] truly it was not premi people didn't
[29:50] come together and say oh I have an
[29:52] investment you have $1 million you have
[29:54] $1 million you be this you be that we
[29:55] share it just like politics is just like
[29:58] governance is they share and they give
[30:00] the crumbs they call it tokconomics it
[30:02] hide under web
[30:03] three it was never like that Satoshi
[30:07] Nakamoto did the test transfer and now
[30:09] you have to do the work you have to show
[30:12] proof that you do the work and then you
[30:14] get your own reward. There's never been
[30:16] anything like that. So, it's so honest.
[30:19] I love it. Every time you get your own
[30:22] profit, I get my own profit based on our
[30:24] bag, based on what you invested. And it
[30:26] is not like Robin because he's white, he
[30:28] will get his profit or his interest
[30:30] earlier than me. No, it's not like Robin
[30:32] is going to get more money or Michael
[30:34] Sailor will get more money and because
[30:36] I'm black or because some Bitcoiners
[30:37] don't like me and then I won't get
[30:39] nothing at all. No, it's equal
[30:41] distribution of profit and loss at the
[30:44] same time. Moreover, if you huddle
[30:46] enough, you will know that you don't
[30:48] ever lose in Bitcoin. No loss. Forget
[30:51] about all the economic jagons. Forget
[30:54] about all the statistical jagons. All
[30:57] those things are nonsense. Check from
[30:59] 2009 till now. What is the performance
[31:01] of your currency? What is performance of
[31:02] your stock? All those things are even
[31:04] inflated and manipulated.
[31:07] But this one for once all of us came
[31:09] together and we agreed and every time
[31:12] peer-to-peer transactions are going
[31:14] transactions are moving and it's lovely.
[31:17] The only time there's centralization is
[31:19] when exchanges come in between the likes
[31:21] of Botney Cash, the likes of Coinbase,
[31:23] the likes of Bitex, all those big big
[31:25] exchanges are the first community
[31:27] regulators. I say Bitcoin have been
[31:29] regulated from day one. We don't need no
[31:32] SEC. It's just that the people like us
[31:34] need to be regulated. people like us,
[31:37] people like all the the big players in
[31:39] the space need to be regulated. You need
[31:40] to submit yourself to uh uh proper
[31:43] scrutiny, right? So the government
[31:46] should do their own thing. But you see
[31:47] BTC itself has been regulated by the
[31:50] consensus
[31:51] mechanism. From day one, the highest
[31:55] regulation of money is in Bitcoin. The
[31:59] highest unadulterated,
[32:02] unfiltered regulation. So any SEC,
[32:05] anybody coming is just trying to learn
[32:08] from Bitcoin and carbon copy that
[32:11] regulation and use it in their own
[32:12] framework and guidelines. So, uh, I tell
[32:16] people from the jump, from the jump, if
[32:20] you look at what Bitcoin is, you will
[32:22] realize that it's for me, it's for you.
[32:26] Whether you buy a thousand bitcoin today
[32:27] and you hle it and don't sell it for
[32:29] whatever whatever type of h um game
[32:34] theory, whatever type of um uh
[32:38] business analysis uh objective, mission,
[32:42] vision, any kind of strategy you add
[32:46] onto Bitcoin for good, it will yield for
[32:49] you. But if you cannot move it over the
[32:51] network, you can never experience the
[32:54] net worth.
[32:55] I say Bitcoin gets it networks from its
[33:00] network. So if you stack and hole, I
[33:03] wish you all the best. I also stack and
[33:05] hoole too. But you see where the fun is
[33:06] for me? I can send swoosh and it cannot
[33:10] be stopped. No matter how if you like me
[33:14] or not, whether Africa, Africans,
[33:18] African leaders or African governments
[33:19] like it or not, they will buy Bitcoin
[33:22] painstakingly one day. You know what's
[33:24] going to be funny and it it's all going
[33:27] to be interesting that even the the US
[33:30] and any country that is stacking Bitcoin
[33:32] now if you need African resources and by
[33:34] then when the leaders wake up and say oh
[33:37] my god one sat is now
[33:40] $100,000 because it's going to happen.
[33:42] My casilla model shout out to him I love
[33:44] him. I mean I don't have such you know
[33:47] tremendous experience and knowledge you
[33:49] know I learn from him all the time and I
[33:50] love it when he mentioned Nigeria but my
[33:53] model I bet you will be wrong by those
[33:55] years because Bitcoin will perform way
[33:58] better there will be one Satoshi mind in
[34:01] 2040 what do you think will happen Robin
[34:04] what will happen to all the mining
[34:06] companies will they shut down for you
[34:07] and I to mine that one Satosh Satoshi or
[34:10] they will compete with guns and bombs
[34:12] and nuclear weapons Some countries will
[34:15] fight some countries and say, "Oh my
[34:17] god, the mining operation in that
[34:19] country is big. We must make sure they
[34:21] don't mine the next block. Let's go and
[34:23] bomb them." And they bring all sorts of
[34:25] economic jagons, all sorts of bilateral
[34:28] trade miscalculation, all types of
[34:31] macroeconomics, unfavorable
[34:34] pronunciations and terminologies to
[34:36] destabilize geopolitical reasons just to
[34:39] be able to ensure that the one sat of
[34:43] 2140 will be mined by a minor in their
[34:46] region. Can you see the political war
[34:49] that will happen just to mine Bitcoin?
[34:51] It's not going to be about killing
[34:52] everybody here and there. Russia and
[34:54] Ukraine. We will read about that story
[34:56] that we years ago people were fighting
[35:00] wars with guns. The war of the future
[35:02] will be fought over the mining of SS.
[35:06] Let's take a break for a moment and
[35:08] appreciate the beauty that coin
[35:10] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[35:13] watches. Those watches are the most
[35:15] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[35:18] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[35:22] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[35:24] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:28] watch collections. You have the date of
[35:30] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[35:33] there and of course also the block
[35:35] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:38] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:41] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:44] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:47] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:49] love those watches. so so much. And now
[35:52] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:55] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:57] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:59] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[36:01] first way is you put it on a hardware
[36:03] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[36:06] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[36:09] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[36:12] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[36:15] if you check out the link in the
[36:17] description, you even get 5% off if you
[36:20] use the code Robin. And the second way
[36:22] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[36:26] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[36:29] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[36:32] They will personalize for you a
[36:34] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:37] your individual situation. They will
[36:40] show you how you can secure your own
[36:42] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:44] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:46] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:49] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:51] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:54] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:57] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:59] last but not least, if you're in a
[37:01] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[37:04] it's better to get a plan B for all
[37:06] that. Head over to the
[37:10] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[37:13] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[37:16] be for the first time ever speaking at
[37:18] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[37:21] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[37:23] really looking forward to seeing all of
[37:25] you there. You can get your ticket in
[37:28] the link down in the description of
[37:30] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[37:32] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:36] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:38] there. That's that's very impactful. I
[37:40] think that that's also very true uh what
[37:43] you just said and I think we already
[37:45] have seen the slow start of that where
[37:49] there is small countries that started
[37:52] mining for example Budhan uh they they
[37:55] have done mining since 2019 and only
[37:58] told people about it in 2024. So they
[38:01] did it 5 years without telling anyone.
[38:05] If you now think about that and think
[38:07] about who else is currently mining and
[38:11] is not telling anyone, who else is
[38:14] currently stacking Bitcoin and not
[38:16] telling anyone? Um, I think it's a lot
[38:19] more than we publicly know. It's not
[38:22] just the US and El Salvador and Budan
[38:25] and and some other smaller ones. It's
[38:27] way more. And it's going on behind
[38:31] curtains. It's it's going on behind the
[38:33] closed doors. And it's definitely
[38:35] happening. For once, Robin, have you
[38:37] ever seen for once an excited community
[38:39] like the Bitcoin community that has
[38:40] beted the shitcoin communities now? And
[38:42] you see how excited everybody? Go to X
[38:45] spaces after this meeting for once and
[38:47] search spaces and you will see how
[38:50] people start spaces and wealthy people
[38:52] connect with middle class and poor.
[38:55] Everybody come and exchange
[38:56] conversations. You and I can connect and
[38:58] talk to the richest and the wealthiest
[39:00] of the world on Xaces, Clubhouse,
[39:03] Discord, different platform talking
[39:04] about hardest money on earth. It never
[39:07] was like that. It was never like that.
[39:09] Nobody was excited to discuss the US
[39:11] dollar, the Naira over Xaces and
[39:13] gathering and doing meetups. No, it was
[39:15] basically maybe them going to Geneva or
[39:18] maybe them going to World Economic
[39:19] Forum. The biggest players, the
[39:21] centralized biggest players in the
[39:23] monetary space are the only ones that
[39:24] can attend money events. Today we are
[39:27] going to Bitcoin conferences. People are
[39:29] starting Bitcoin programs. People are
[39:31] doing Bitcoin artworks and making money.
[39:34] It has never been like that.
[39:37] The excitement in this community is so
[39:40] different that a young person from the
[39:42] confines of their home in Africa and
[39:45] then in Nigeria who has no way out
[39:48] living under inflation and poverty can
[39:50] just immerse themselves in Bitcoin
[39:52] education and with the little amount of
[39:55] power electricity that they get and or
[39:57] internet data they learn and say wow
[40:00] okay and it starts to just serve the
[40:02] education back and their life can change
[40:05] like that. People have invested in
[40:07] mining business. People have invested in
[40:09] exchange business, peer-to-peer OTC
[40:11] businesses. Relationships have been
[40:13] built crossroad just because of Bitcoin
[40:16] for good. And it's just 16 years old, a
[40:19] juvenile if it were a human being. What
[40:21] do you think will happen when Bitcoin is
[40:23] 30, a mature man? Love that. Really
[40:24] cool. How do you actually look at uh you
[40:27] mentioned Donald Trump before and we're
[40:28] now talking about uh that a little bit.
[40:31] How did you look when you first heard
[40:33] about Donald Trump being more and more
[40:35] into Bitcoin? When then the strategic
[40:37] Bitcoin reserve was uh introduced and
[40:39] when you see like Michael Sailor sitting
[40:41] almost close almost next to Donald
[40:44] Trump. It was very sweet. Um I've always
[40:47] known that something like that would
[40:48] happen, but I didn't know that it was
[40:49] going to be Donald Trump. But I'm I'm
[40:52] not surprised. Can't you see Larry
[40:53] Frink? Can't you see Michael himself? If
[40:56] you were a naysayer yesterday, it's to
[40:58] your own peril today. If you are not a
[41:01] yes person to
[41:03] BTC is you sitting on a gunpowder of
[41:06] fiat. We all have read Michael Sailor's
[41:08] story. Wonderful postman for
[41:11] BTC. We all have read his story. We all
[41:14] see how he has now brought all that
[41:17] relevant years of experience into
[41:20] marketing Bitcoin in a new dimension
[41:22] that a lot of us never knew. So we saw
[41:25] the the tweets are there. The internet
[41:27] never forgets when Donald Trump was
[41:29] against Bitcoin. Today he saw what
[41:31] Bitcoin community was able to do for him
[41:33] in election and he can see how powerful
[41:35] it is. Even him have tasted the money in
[41:37] the space that Bitcoin bettered and then
[41:39] people have manipulated it. He has done
[41:41] shitcoin. We know that. But thank God
[41:44] he's trying to clean his tracks by
[41:46] basically creating and separating the
[41:49] digital stock pile stock pile from the
[41:53] strategic Bitcoin reserve. Look at those
[41:56] unique names. God bless whoever coined
[41:58] those titles. Strategic Bitcoin reserve
[42:02] digital stock
[42:04] pile. It looks like good and bad, but
[42:07] let's just have it anyway. You know, it
[42:10] looks like um oh premium, you know,
[42:13] individual project and oh for everybody
[42:15] stock and pile them, you know. So, so
[42:19] it's Donald Trump that is benefiting
[42:22] from Bitcoin's posy
[42:24] PR is the president of the United States
[42:27] of America that is benefiting from the
[42:29] PR and of course largely expanding his
[42:32] coast by doing other things. But look at
[42:35] what Bitcoin has done for him. So I
[42:38] don't I'm expecting African presidents
[42:41] to campaign for with Bitcoin so that
[42:44] their PR can be can be on another level.
[42:48] Any African
[42:49] president today, mark my word, that uses
[42:54] Bitcoin as a forefront campaign
[42:58] uh um strategy like Donald Trump did
[43:02] will get cheap international worldwide
[43:05] PR. You know why? because Bitcoin
[43:08] authentically like to support anybody
[43:10] who has found that truth and it's just
[43:13] so sad that people now take advantage of
[43:16] that and just use it wrongfully. So I
[43:19] don't feel somehow I'm just very happy
[43:21] for Americans. Of course I have my
[43:22] family there, my mom, my my my brother,
[43:24] my blood brother. So it's good for their
[43:27] country and anybody that takes advantage
[43:29] of it. Uh what I just wish is um that my
[43:33] country also wake up. But whether they
[43:36] wake up or not, I pray that they keep
[43:39] they keep having this argument here and
[43:41] there and and then we are able to stack
[43:43] as much s as possible, you know. But I
[43:45] wanted to say something that I I skipped
[43:47] the train of my thought that
[43:50] um whether America likes it or not,
[43:53] whether Sailor likes it or not, one day
[43:56] all that Bitcoin they are stacking that
[43:57] you're borrowing against and doing
[43:59] everything, you will use it to trade
[44:01] because you might need gold from Africa.
[44:03] You might need oil from Africa. You
[44:05] might need something one day and one
[44:07] bitcoin is now a 100 million and then
[44:09] they have realized especially the
[44:11] millennials who will become the baby
[44:13] boomers of tomorrow. The gen the genz's
[44:15] of today will become the millennials of
[44:17] tomorrow will now have accumulated
[44:19] enough knowledge and they will be able
[44:20] to say no you got this student for cheap
[44:24] from our forefathers. You won't get it
[44:26] for cheap from us. you will have to pay
[44:27] us uh we know you have a stack of 1
[44:30] million BTC so you're going to have to
[44:31] pay us 20% of that for our oil and they
[44:34] will do it in the open and bitcoiners
[44:36] will support and say yeah give it to
[44:37] them if you want it if you don't want it
[44:39] they say they don't want your fiat and
[44:41] you will trade with it and nobody will
[44:42] be able to stop it there will not be any
[44:44] reason for any country to be sanctioned
[44:47] and say no bitcoin will not move over a
[44:49] rail except they don't run their own
[44:51] node you can run your node and nobody
[44:53] will see you over at all and over so
[44:55] many other strate ies right so uh I I
[45:00] wish America the best I wish Donald
[45:02] Trump the best with what he's doing I
[45:04] hope he's doing it with a sincerity of
[45:05] purpose it's giving him a positive PR
[45:08] and other African leaders and leaders of
[45:10] the world are now seeing it it's a good
[45:12] thing even for people like us because
[45:13] the people that you have educated before
[45:15] and ignored you maybe because they're
[45:17] wealthier than you or because they are
[45:18] more knowledgeable than you or they have
[45:20] access to power and resources than you
[45:22] are now calling or are now seeing it and
[45:24] saying oh That dude was a preacher. He
[45:28] was the word of God. He was sincere, you
[45:31] know, by themselves. It is you that will
[45:33] change for Bitcoin. Bitcoin will not
[45:34] change for you. It is at your own peril
[45:37] again to undermine the future that
[45:39] Bitcoin has brought forward for you
[45:41] today. Are you already on a almost full
[45:45] Bitcoin standard? Are you operating on
[45:47] on a Bitcoin standard? Of course, my
[45:49] life has already been hyper bitcoinized,
[45:51] you know, because um I am the one who do
[45:54] the work of orange peeling people and
[45:56] making sure that I can spend my bitcoin
[45:58] where necessary. Uh I would say what to
[46:01] a fact whether you believe it or not,
[46:02] whether anybody believes it or not that
[46:04] any astute bitcoiner in Nigeria knows
[46:07] that it is u pennywise pound foolish. It
[46:10] is um sitting on a time bump to save in
[46:15] the naira. Even the wealthiest of the
[46:17] wealthiest in Nigeria don't save in
[46:18] Naira. They always look for how to, you
[46:20] know, take their money and put it
[46:21] elsewhere. So I don't have money in
[46:23] Naira. As a matter of fact, that's why
[46:25] my internet data went off, you know. So
[46:27] I have to quickly, you know, convert BTC
[46:30] to cash and and then buy data. Look,
[46:32] I'll tell you
[46:34] something. Go to Google, pick Nigerian
[46:38] naira, right? Go to the currency section
[46:42] and write one S of BTC. one sat of BTC
[46:46] to the Nigerian era, what you see will
[46:49] shock you. And it's like that across the
[46:51] world, right? One S of
[46:54] Nigerian of of Bitcoin is already
[46:57] greater than the Nigerian naira. Even
[46:59] the Nigerian government must wake up.
[47:00] Some people think that I'm talking it
[47:02] down on my country. What do you mean?
[47:04] No, I'm exposing the flaws of our
[47:06] economy. That's that's what I'm saying.
[47:08] This is our reality. I am not close to
[47:11] the money printer. What do you want me
[47:12] to do? continue to eat their lies and
[47:15] they shove it down my throat then I
[47:18] don't speak out when I can find the
[47:19] truth. No, for every s you
[47:24] save you are escaping the
[47:28] cancerous inflation that is killing your
[47:31] purchase power in Nigeria and all over
[47:34] the world daily. So it's natural. Yes,
[47:39] do it one two naira. You'll be shocked.
[47:43] That's one 31 cobble. So why should I
[47:45] freaking save in the naira? Tell me when
[47:48] just down the line two years ago the
[47:50] naira huh just one naira could buy
[47:53] multiple sacks. It could buy it could
[47:56] buy as much one naira could buy as much
[47:58] as over a,000 sacks. But today look at
[48:01] what it is. What makes you think in the
[48:03] next 10 years 20 years down the line add
[48:07] it to your age. Add it to my age. Let me
[48:08] add it to my 3 years old daughter age
[48:10] that one SAT will not become almost a
[48:13] 100,000 naira between the next short few
[48:16] years. So I'm not crying so much because
[48:20] I've already experienced this with the
[48:22] dollar. $1 is about 1,500 1,600 even
[48:26] rose to about 2,000 some time
[48:28] ago. Same thing for the pounds UK
[48:31] pounds.
[48:33] So we already accustomed to this and a
[48:36] smart person will opt out quickly and
[48:38] that's why I keep saying it that
[48:39] Americans are watching the US dollar has
[48:43] already been
[48:44] strangled by Bitcoin strangled and they
[48:48] should be telling their own stories just
[48:51] like we're telling our own stories right
[48:53] so uh when people say oh Bitcoin uh
[48:56] they're trying to help uh uh
[48:58] underprivileged world uh the global
[49:00] south it helps them for this help them
[49:02] for that. Help yourself first. Look at
[49:05] how Bitcoin has messed up your own
[49:06] currency. Before you talk about Nigeria,
[49:09] take out the log in your
[49:11] eyes before you come and say, "Yes, you
[49:14] want to help me wipe the sweat on my
[49:16] face." It's true what Bitcoin has done
[49:20] to every currency on earth.
[49:22] We should all be out there apart from
[49:25] God Almighty that we worship. We should
[49:28] all be out there celebrating and giving
[49:31] a round of applause, giving placets of
[49:34] of celebration to Satoshi Nakamoto, post
[49:37] humorous awards. That's what we should
[49:39] be doing. That's what we should be
[49:42] doing. I bet you the IMF will integrate
[49:44] Bitcoin into their monetary policies.
[49:47] Won't be damn if they don't do it. They
[49:49] would do it.
[49:50] they will do it
[49:52] painstakingly. So you see the facts why
[49:55] I have to hyper bitcoinize. So I am
[49:59] already in so much bitcoin. I may not
[50:01] have as much bitcoin than you. I may not
[50:03] have much bitcoin than another person.
[50:06] But what I have I have already opted out
[50:08] of naira. I only spend when I need
[50:10] naira. Yes. Because I am in the exchange
[50:13] business. Right. It's only natural for
[50:15] me to have naira for buying of bitcoin.
[50:18] You receive naira when clients wants to
[50:21] buy bitcoin, right? And then you convert
[50:23] that naira to, you know, the currency
[50:26] where you can use to buy that bitcoin as
[50:28] quick as possible. Usually you find a
[50:30] way to stabilize you stabilize that
[50:32] naira, right? So, and that's why I love
[50:36] um what those my friends are doing with
[50:38] the CGN, the naira stable coin. It's a
[50:41] breaking news. I'm telling you right
[50:42] now, watch out for it. You know, I don't
[50:45] need to come back to the US dollar any
[50:46] longer. Everybody should wake up.
[50:48] America is building a strategy for
[50:51] stable coins worldwide. Yeah, we love
[50:53] it. But guess what? You think the other
[50:55] countries are sleeping in this new
[50:58] monetary system of the world, the format
[51:00] is going to be that I don't need your US
[51:02] dollar? Because the moment the CGN, the
[51:06] newly introduced Naira stable coin comes
[51:09] on the Bitcoin blockchain and I can use
[51:10] it over lightning, why should I converse
[51:12] to bit US dollar? I'll do all my
[51:15] transaction in Naira on the Bitcoin
[51:18] blockchain. So I tell those Bitcoiners
[51:22] that are undermining what tap routt can
[51:24] do to just shut the up because that
[51:28] is what is going to automate, engineer
[51:30] and
[51:31] accelerate the new ways to
[51:35] spend monies of countries on chain.
[51:41] A lot of people will put their monies on
[51:44]  up chains, alternative chains,
[51:47] but the ones on Bitcoin will re supreme.
[51:50] If not, why is Ted now trying to be I
[51:53] mean USDT on the Bitcoin blockchain? You
[51:55] will see how people abandon that of Tron
[51:57] and F, you know. So the the the the game
[52:02] theory might not favor the US even when
[52:04] they trying to buy Bitcoin and stack it
[52:06] as much as possible and say we will go
[52:09] with the stable coin regulation and make
[52:12] sure anybody that wants to buy the
[52:13] stable coin thingy they don't know what
[52:15] Satoshi J um Satoshi Nakamoto has done
[52:18] he has done something completely unique
[52:20] and different that every time you try to
[52:24] manipulate what he has invented because
[52:28] you are still operating with that money
[52:31] printing mindset you will fail. So it
[52:35] may not be what the US is thinking that
[52:38] their US dollar will reign supreme when
[52:40] countries now realize that we can
[52:42] actually put our currency their
[52:44] inflationary dying currency on lightning
[52:47] and then they can move
[52:50] boom. People may not ever interact with
[52:54] the dollar again and the world will
[52:56] change in our very eyes while we are
[52:59] alive. Pay attention. Don't sleep on a
[53:02] bicycle that has no tires. I love it. Uh
[53:05] you you're painting a very clear picture
[53:07] and I love also the background with
[53:09] Nigeria and it's it's crazy for me
[53:11] honestly because um we've seen the
[53:14] Bitcoin US dollar charts. We've seen the
[53:17] Bitcoin euro charts but what we I mean
[53:21] we uh I'm from Austria and talk a lot
[53:25] with American Bitcoiners and and UK
[53:27] Bitcoiners and stuff like that. But if
[53:28] you actually compare uh the Nigerian uh
[53:33] um Naira to Bitcoin from
[53:38] 2016 to now Nigerian Naira has according
[53:43] to Google lost
[53:46] 99.93% against
[53:48] Bitcoin. That that is that is so crazy.
[53:53] That that is absolutely absurd. And I'm
[53:56] just uh looking at it. Maybe I can uh
[54:00] quickly do that. What What is the same
[54:03] rate for let's say the US dollar? Um why
[54:07] do I don't see the US dollar here? Oh
[54:10] gosh. Why don't they see the US dollar
[54:12] here? It's right there. It's right
[54:15] there. But you know the fun the the the
[54:17] thing is it looks like it's still better
[54:19] for the US dollar because US dollar is
[54:21] the standard reserve currency of the
[54:24] world now. But if you zoom out, you
[54:26] would know that the most hurt is the US
[54:29] dollar because it's the one that
[54:33] is facing it the the the the pain the
[54:37] most. The one that is that that is
[54:40] susceptible to quicker
[54:43] collapse is the US dollar. America
[54:46] should be thankful to Donald Trump once
[54:50] again
[54:51] for making sure that Bitcoin comes to
[54:54] the forefront of conversation in the
[54:56] White House. Very soon you will start
[54:59] seeing meetings, White House meetings
[55:01] with countries. The US using their world
[55:04] power to negotiate with Nigeria for
[55:05] example and saying look electricity is
[55:07] cheap in your country. So we'll give you
[55:10] security. you give us free electricity
[55:12] and lo and some land, you know, we ship
[55:14] Bitcoin miners to your country. The
[55:16] conversations will change. It's not
[55:18] going to be about what it's about now.
[55:21] Nobody's going to be borrowing money
[55:22] here and there when the future comes.
[55:24] What do I want to use the US dollar for?
[55:26] Because I already know that I have a
[55:28] naira that is inflationary that's, you
[55:30] know, dependent on US dollar before. But
[55:33] now I put it on Bitcoin blockchain.
[55:35] Shout out to those people that have done
[55:37] it and the people that will do it. Ted
[55:39] is already success successful but you do
[55:42] you think that the world will sit down
[55:44] and let Ted and USDC be used as a Trojan
[55:46] O to completely continue to impoverish
[55:50] them? No. People are waking up and so
[55:53] the negotiation will change and then the
[55:55] US president of now or then and anybody
[55:58] that is smart will invite other leaders
[56:00] and say look what can you do for me? Can
[56:03] I bring in 200,000 miners to your
[56:06] country and mine for free?
[56:09] and get a subsidized energy rates and
[56:11] then I promise you I'll give visas to
[56:13] your people. I'll give free education to
[56:14] your people. I'll give you other things
[56:16] that I have. I will I I'll cut tariffs
[56:20] on the cars that come to your country on
[56:23] the uh phone gadgets. I'll give economic
[56:26] opportunities for you just because I
[56:28] realize that you have uh uh um you know
[56:32] water you know that I can use to you
[56:34] know create energy. You know you have
[56:37] dams that is not really doing so much is
[56:41] just wasting away power source that is
[56:44] not going to the people and then wasting
[56:46] away. What I can do for you is
[56:49] incentivize that your energy you get
[56:52] more money I get money we share the
[56:54] money and then we supply more
[56:55] electricity to your people. How about
[56:57] that? Oh that's good. I love it. And
[56:58] then you know I give you this in return.
[57:01] Good business. Handshake. You see how
[57:03] the dynamics is going to change. It
[57:05] would change. it would change. So even
[57:08] though the NRA is plummeting, I keep
[57:09] saying it that a smart Bitcoiner should
[57:12] not concern himself about that, America
[57:14] is the country that should begin to look
[57:17] at how they will
[57:20] lose that thing that they think that the
[57:23] dollar is. And that's where my I love
[57:27] the US. I love is the best country that
[57:30] I've ever been. Even though I'm
[57:31] Nigerian, I love it. My mother, my
[57:33] brothers are there. I advise anybody if
[57:36] you have never been to America, you have
[57:37] not seen a free world before. But the US
[57:40] dollar will never reign supreme as long
[57:42] as Bitcoin remains what it is. It will
[57:45] never in our face. Maybe not while we
[57:48] are alive and we will not die young. We
[57:50] will live long enough to see these
[57:52] things unfold. It will not take a 100
[57:54] years. It won't. It will take sooner
[57:57] than we think. It might just happen in
[57:59] the next 15 years. You would not believe
[58:01] it. As long as people are not sleeping,
[58:03] as long as people are awake, autocratic
[58:05] leaders will leave something will
[58:07] happen. There is never
[58:10] permanent occurrence, leadership or
[58:13] championship. What what you have is
[58:16] current. So current always move change.
[58:20] The only thing that is constant is
[58:22] change. So there's no permanent. It's
[58:24] current that you have the current
[58:25] situation will
[58:27] change, right? And then surprise will
[58:30] happen on earth like Donald Trump is
[58:31] surprising Americans and fighting
[58:33] corruption for real and they are
[58:34] revolting. Corruption fights back when
[58:36] you're fighting it. That is what will
[58:37] happen. America will fight back so much
[58:39] and it will be like oh my god why did we
[58:41] adopt Bitcoin? Why did we adopt Bitcoin?
[58:44] It's killing the US dollar. It has
[58:46] already strangled the US dollar is it
[58:48] has held the US dollar captive. It is
[58:50] just going to unveil it to other people
[58:51] and say look you guys have been
[58:53] manipulated for so long. Watch what will
[58:56] happen. watch. But we would be lucky the
[59:00] iPad Bitcoin once early. It will just be
[59:02] a better market for you and I. Then
[59:04] we'll be able to send more SS and one S
[59:06] will watch tremendously high and those
[59:08] countries that don't adopt Bitcoin will
[59:10] still be there dwelling there and we can
[59:12] just go and use 10,000 SS to buy a
[59:14] highrise. Woo. It would be beautiful.
[59:17] I love I love your energy. It's it's
[59:20] it's really really cool. Um uh it it was
[59:24] really cool all those topics that we
[59:26] have discussed. Uh I I really enjoy uh
[59:28] enjoy our conversation already. Looking
[59:30] forward to releasing it. Um one one
[59:33] thing I always ask my guests is what can
[59:36] we learn from you besides Bitcoin.
[59:40] I tweeted something this morning. Let me
[59:42] go back there. That's always the
[59:43] question where the guests uh thinks the
[59:46] longest. All all the Bitcoiners are
[59:49] thinking the longest of like, oh, like
[59:50] what can we learn from you besides
[59:52] Bitcoin?
[59:55] Let me read this out to you. I'll read
[59:57] out uh one tweet. Some I tweeted this
[60:00] this morning. Some won't believe you
[60:03] even if it's undeniably true. But that's
[60:06] not their fault. It's your
[60:08] responsibility to continue to win.
[60:13] Bitcoin is what you should use as a
[60:15] mantra for racing ahead of them
[60:20] all. For me, my integrity have been
[60:24] tested. I have come out and
[60:27] triumph. The truth will always rear its
[60:31] head. Stay positive. Do not isolate
[60:36] yourself but remove yourself for any
[60:40] from any energy that want to change your
[60:45] color. Stand for that positive thing
[60:48] that you believe and you will see how
[60:51] the universe will work in your favor.
[60:54] Never forget to open your mouth and
[60:57] speak what you want to this sky. open
[61:02] sky that God Almighty has blessed all of
[61:04] us with. It's the same sky all over the
[61:07] world, the same blue sky, the same sky
[61:11] that you have in your country in
[61:12] Austria. It's what I have in Nigeria.
[61:14] It's what everybody have. So if you put
[61:17] these words
[61:18] together, make use of it and interpret
[61:21] it however you like. But never ever ever
[61:25] let your enemy win. Never let what they
[61:29] say define who you are and what you will
[61:32] become. Change is constant. Change your
[61:36] life. Change your ways. Tomorrow is
[61:40] pregnant. Make sure it birth something
[61:42] nice for you. That that's beautiful. Uh
[61:46] that that's really pregnant. Yeah. Uh
[61:50] let's birth something beautiful
[61:51] tomorrow. I like that. I like that
[61:54] saying a lot. Um really cool. Thank you
[61:57] so much. uh for for for for that. Um we
[62:00] have an entertaining podcast where the
[62:02] previous guest is asking a question for
[62:04] the next guest without knowing who the
[62:06] next guest actually is and the previous
[62:08] guest asks you the question what is the
[62:11] biggest thing Bitcoin will change in
[62:14] your world uh in our world and it's I
[62:17] mean I guess it's the same world. Um I
[62:20] don't think I'm in the position to
[62:22] answer that or to to to express that but
[62:26] I will try in the best of my knowledge.
[62:27] I just believe that other astute
[62:29] Bitcoiners uh may have represented this
[62:32] question way better because I learned
[62:34] from other great Bitcoiners that you
[62:36] have also interviewed and and some of
[62:38] the ones that may will or would be. Uh
[62:41] but I would like to say and maybe ask
[62:44] what are you doing with all the Bitcoin
[62:47] you're stacking and what are you doing
[62:49] for Bitcoin? It's very I love that
[62:52] because people undermine the question.
[62:55] People undermine the question with the
[62:57] sincerity of purpose. Look into your
[63:00] heart. Are you using Bitcoin to colonize
[63:03] even more?
[63:04] Are you using Bitcoin to stay autocratic
[63:09] or you using Bitcoin to change yourself
[63:13] and change others for
[63:16] good? The question is unique to whoever
[63:20] is coming and I would like to learn from
[63:22] their answer. I love that. Thank you so
[63:24] much. And before I let you go, um, where
[63:28] can people find you, ask you questions
[63:29] and and reach out to you? Where's the
[63:31] best place to to reach out to you? Well,
[63:34] yeah. uh on X on LinkedIn. I'm very
[63:36] active on X on LinkedIn. I don't use my
[63:37] Facebook any longer. My full names can
[63:39] be searched on Google, but uh this is my
[63:42] handle. Maybe you can just type it in.
[63:44] Uh I'll put my link on it. Let me
[63:47] quickly send you I will I will put the
[63:49] Twitter handle in in the description so
[63:51] people can find me directly there. You
[63:53] can find me on Twitter. If you find find
[63:54] me on Twitter, DM me. If you can if you
[63:56] cannot DM me, follow me. Request for a
[63:58] DM. Um yeah, you can find me. And then
[64:01] you know I would like to if you don't
[64:02] mind uh first of all I want to thank you
[64:04] Robin for inviting me. I appreciate you.
[64:06] Salute to your work. It's not easy to u
[64:09] give people a platform for expression as
[64:11] uh you're giving us expression platform.
[64:13] You're also benefiting and I want to
[64:15] pray for you that the universe will
[64:17] continue to favor you. The work that
[64:18] you're doing um will continue to blossom
[64:22] uh and germinates positively for you.
[64:24] However, I would like to use opportunity
[64:26] to invite you to the first ever Niger
[64:28] Bitcoin. Uh the second edition of the
[64:30] Niger Bitcoin Conference, we had one
[64:32] last year. You can check out the website
[64:34] if you like. Share it with your people.
[64:35] I don't know if you've ever been to
[64:36] Africa. Uh travel information is on the
[64:39] website. Please come to Nigeria. I will
[64:42] be willing to host you. I'm ready to
[64:43] host you. I'll clear you from the
[64:44] airport and come and see what we do with
[64:47] Bitcoin for real and tell your audience
[64:49] for real.
[64:50] Um and also I would like a situation
[64:53] whereby uh male and female bitcoiners
[64:56] can help mentor the Nigerian women
[64:58] bitcoiners that we have. Women change
[65:00] the world so much. They are productive
[65:03] in nature. They are multipliers in
[65:05] nature. When you educate one woman, you
[65:08] you educate a nation. So um more Bitcoin
[65:12] education is needed for proper Bitcoin
[65:15] adoption not that short-term adoption
[65:17] than then that then can be converted to
[65:19] shitcoining. So uh please help spread
[65:23] this word that a bitcoin conference is
[65:24] happening in Nigeria in 2024 in Nigeria.
[65:27] I don't mean in Africa. So but you are
[65:30] welcome from the diaspora from anywhere
[65:32] all over the world. Just go to the
[65:34] website information is being updated day
[65:36] by day. I personally sponsored the
[65:38] Bitcoin conference in Nigeria with my
[65:40] own money about 98% shout out to one or
[65:43] two persons that supported right uh but
[65:47] because we couldn't find support and I
[65:48] needed to show a proof of work unlike
[65:50] other Bitcoin conferences that get
[65:52] funding you know because I don't want
[65:54] people to call me names or say this and
[65:56] that. So I decided to say we will show
[65:58] you what proof of work is and we did it
[66:00] and we had our keynote speaker as the
[66:02] director general of the SEC. Guess who
[66:04] we will be having as keynote speaker or
[66:06] keynote speakers this year. It's going
[66:08] to be wonderful. Watch out for Nigeria.
[66:11] That's what I would like uh to say last.
[66:12] And again, thank you uh largely uh if
[66:15] you don't mind sometime coming. Uh I
[66:18] would like to also host you on the
[66:19] Africa Bitcoin space so we learn from
[66:22] your story yourself. Thank you so much.
[66:25] I really appreciate the invite and then
[66:26] I will definitely be there. I love
[66:28] Twitter spaces. They they are most
[66:30] amazing. Also, thank you so much for
[66:31] everyone that is watching and listening
[66:33] for joining us today. As always, I'll be
[66:35] back tomorrow with another episode.
[66:37] Bye-bye. Bye.
