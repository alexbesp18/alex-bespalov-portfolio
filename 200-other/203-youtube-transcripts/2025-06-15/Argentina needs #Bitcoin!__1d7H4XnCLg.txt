[00:00] Argentina hits a new record inflation
[00:03] rate of over
[00:07] 133% year over year that is more than
[00:10] double that what turkey has the Central
[00:13] Bank in Argentina is failing so fast
[00:16] that it sends Bitcoin to a absolute new
[00:20] all-time high in the Argentine peso but
[00:23] even against other Fiat currencies like
[00:25] the US dollar is the Adam peso at an
[00:29] absolute new alltime low and we all know
[00:32] that the world needs Bitcoin but
[00:35] especially countries like Argentina are
[00:37] Desperately Seeking sound money this
[00:40] could be the reason that this guy here
[00:43] Javier Mele is absolutely ahead in every
[00:47] polls in the Argentina presidential
[00:49] election this presidential election is
[00:52] happening this Sunday everybody that
[00:55] follows the Argentina election is
[00:57] counting on Javier m winning but why is
[01:01] that good for Bitcoin let's hear what
[01:03] Javier M has to say about central banks
[01:06] and
[01:28] Bitcoin
[01:42] he is absolutely clear in his message he
[01:45] wants to demolish the Central Bank in
[01:47] Argentina he wants to adopt the US
[01:50] dollar in the short term and he's a big
[01:52] big fan of the private money like
[01:55] Bitcoin if he actually gets elected we
[01:58] can maybe see Argentina switching to an
[02:02] dollar standard and slowly following the
[02:05] model of El Salvador slowly adopting
[02:08] Bitcoin making Bitcoin possible there
[02:11] and maybe over the long run they succeed
[02:14] in getting rid of any feat currencies
[02:16] but whatever is happening with Argentina
[02:19] at the election one thing is totally
[02:21] clear right now more and more
[02:24] politicians more and more institutional
[02:27] investors are adopting Bitcoin not
[02:29] because they are fascinated by the
[02:31] attack they have to adopt it why is
[02:35] Black Rock adopting Bitcoin they don't
[02:37] want Bitcoin but they are seeing an
[02:39] opportunity to make lots and lots of
[02:42] money with Bitcoin Bitcoin is aligning
[02:44] the incentive for everybody so we are
[02:46] having more freedom Bitcoin is like a
[02:49] droan horse for those big institutional
[02:51] investors and for countries and for
[02:53] everybody else they think oh let's
[02:56] profit on that and inside of the Trojan
[02:58] Horse there is freedom and maybe Javier
[03:01] m is also following the developments
[03:04] that are happening in El Salvador last
[03:07] month and big Bank Santander was coming
[03:10] out with a report about El Salvador that
[03:13] was extremely positive they are
[03:15] highlighting the great performance of
[03:17] the El Salvador bonds they're writing
[03:19] the rally on El Salvador bonds almost
[03:22] defies gravity with bond prices now
[03:25] comfortably in the 70s and years near a
[03:28] threshold that might soon suggest Market
[03:32] access they're also writing about the
[03:34] ridiculously low murder rate right now
[03:38] in El Salvador El Salvador had 2021 one
[03:41] of the highest murder rates of all time
[03:44] of all Nations and now one of the lowest
[03:47] of all nations in the Western Hemisphere
[03:49] no matter where you look at GDP at
[03:52] tourism at homicides El Salvador is a
[03:55] glowing and Rising Country and this
[03:58] example will lead lead to other
[04:00] countries following that example it's
[04:02] just a matter of time till Argentina and
[04:05] other countries are following this exact
[04:08] example Bitcoin is now at the point
[04:10] where it's just Unstoppable we are
[04:12] having sound money finally after a long
[04:15] period of feared money we desperately
[04:18] needed it and now we having the option
[04:20] to and the opportunity right now to
[04:23] adopted when everybody is asleep on that
[04:26] specific new Revolution is just abs so
[04:30] make sure to stack enough sets bye-bye
