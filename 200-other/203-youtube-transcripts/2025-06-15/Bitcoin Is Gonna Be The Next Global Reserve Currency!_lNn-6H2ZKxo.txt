[00:00] Bitcoin is on its way to becoming the
[00:01] global reserve currency and and maybe
[00:03] more uh sooner than we think. When you
[00:06] have a money that is more effectively
[00:08] storing time, you feel more of an
[00:11] abundance of time and you feel less
[00:13] pressure on how you're spending your
[00:15] time. Because we don't have effective
[00:17] tools simply for saving, we've really
[00:20] lost touch with the concept of just
[00:22] saving. We need to solve the problem of
[00:24] being able to save. And I think Bitcoin
[00:26] is really this, you know, modern
[00:28] renaissance 2.0 you know, version of a
[00:30] savings tool. Monetary entropy is a
[00:32] system where an increasing amount of
[00:34] energy over time is unavailable to do
[00:36] what it's meant to do. And the byproduct
[00:38] of that is that the system itself makes
[00:41] less and less sense. I think that we
[00:43] need to get to a place where Bitcoin is
[00:44] is spent. How soon that needs to happen,
[00:47] my opinion would be
[00:50] [Music]
[00:52] Hi Scott, how you doing? Everything fine
[00:54] on your end? Great. Yeah, Robin, I'm uh
[00:57] super pumped to be back, man. appreciate
[00:58] you uh inviting me on. Absolutely. I I
[01:01] love the first one, so I was like, let's
[01:02] let's do a second one. And uh it's it's
[01:05] really interesting. We just talked about
[01:06] that um that you're trying to to give
[01:09] that vintage vibe if in your company to
[01:12] remember to to make people remember the
[01:14] old times, the the golden times, if you
[01:16] will. And so you also think that Bitcoin
[01:20] brings that uh those gold, if I remember
[01:22] correctly, I think you said there's a
[01:24] golden age of reasoning coming. Did did
[01:27] I remember that correctly? Yeah. You
[01:29] know, I had this idea about like I mean
[01:31] it's not my idea, but one of the Bitcoin
[01:33] ideas I really love is the concept of
[01:35] monetary entropy. And it's the idea that
[01:38] inside the fiat monetary system. So
[01:41] entropy it can be defined a few
[01:43] different ways. One way to describe it
[01:45] is sort of a measure of disorder or
[01:48] chaos. And uh the nature of entropy in
[01:52] uh in a system is that uh it increases
[01:56] over time. And so monetary entropy is a
[02:00] system where um an increasingly an
[02:03] increasing amount of energy over time is
[02:05] unavailable to do what it's meant to do.
[02:07] And the byproduct of that is that the
[02:09] system itself makes less and less sense.
[02:13] And uh we all make sense of the world
[02:14] with money. It makes sense to me that uh
[02:17] then as we go forward into the world and
[02:19] we try to make sense of the price of an
[02:22] apple or how much we should be paid for
[02:24] an hour of our work, uh we're we're
[02:27] increasingly trying to go out and
[02:29] communicate with each other and build a
[02:32] civilization using a measuring stick
[02:35] that is sort of intrinsically itself
[02:37] nonsensical. And so this is why I think
[02:40] we're really seeing what's going on in
[02:41] the world today. I think that we are uh
[02:44] seeing an increased measure of disorder
[02:47] in the fundamental base layer of uh one
[02:50] of the tools that we all use to make
[02:52] sense of reality. And so uh talk about
[02:56] golden age of reason. This is like the
[02:57] idea that uh in the distant past when we
[03:01] had much more order um this is when we
[03:04] saw the most beautiful buildings in the
[03:06] world being built, the most low time
[03:08] preference decisions being made as a
[03:10] group. And this is the art and
[03:11] architecture that you see throughout
[03:13] Europe from sort of the long 19th
[03:15] century. Uh you know uh American
[03:17] independence to the start of World War
[03:19] I. There was almost no inflation or very
[03:21] minimal uh fluctuation in price compared
[03:24] to what we experience now. And uh I
[03:26] think uncoincidentally during that time
[03:29] was a high time of uh flourishing of
[03:32] civilization. So um you know back to
[03:34] like the branding and and the the gold
[03:36] the good old days. I was born in 1980.
[03:38] I'm a kid of the 80s. Uh I had older
[03:41] siblings and so the the 70s stuff was
[03:43] very much like present in my childhood.
[03:46] Um you know Star Wars and Barbarella and
[03:49] um all of that stuff. And so I do also
[03:54] think that in our within our own
[03:55] lifetimes now most people depending on
[03:57] how old you are have observed this
[04:00] accelerating disorder in uh in society
[04:03] that is a downstream problem of how
[04:06] money was working. It is absolutely 100%
[04:08] true that life was just a lot simpler
[04:10] when money worked better. And many of us
[04:12] are old enough to remember that life.
[04:14] And this is kind of that life of you
[04:16] know we used to get out and ride a bike.
[04:19] We used to actually go to restaurants
[04:22] with each other and uh not worry about
[04:24] what people were doing elsewhere. We
[04:26] could just sit and talk to each other.
[04:28] We you know fundamentally how we thought
[04:30] about interacting with with the world
[04:31] was different. we didn't used to pay
[04:33] attention to the price of stocks
[04:35] multiple times a day. Um all of these
[04:38] things are uh making life sort of more
[04:41] complicated, more stressful, making it
[04:42] harder. And uh and this is why I think
[04:45] what what we really want to help people
[04:47] understand is that among other things um
[04:51] Bitcoin is a is a tool that can provide
[04:54] a a level of order uh back to human
[04:57] civilization by you know really um
[05:00] allowing us to plan for the future with
[05:02] certainty when we can all sort of come
[05:04] to an agreement around the rules of how
[05:06] money works. that is sort of the base
[05:09] step for things to become simpler for
[05:12] people to think about things in a very
[05:14] simple way. Uh you know many of the
[05:17] greatest stresses that we have right now
[05:20] um the price of desirable assets
[05:22] becoming further and further out of
[05:23] reach, your paycheck not going as far as
[05:26] it used to and causing you to have to,
[05:28] you know, have sleepless nights about
[05:29] how you're going to pay your bills or
[05:31] have the kind of life you want to have.
[05:33] Um the these are all things that I think
[05:35] are problems that can be addressed with
[05:37] Bitcoin. Uh which is really exciting,
[05:39] but that the biggest challenge is
[05:40] helping you know the rest of most of the
[05:43] world understand how how we get there.
[05:45] And so yeah, it's uh it's an exciting
[05:47] time man. I think that we are seeing
[05:50] like uh among other things tariffs and
[05:53] and what's going on in the global
[05:55] economy right now. These are these are
[05:58] um symptoms of the system really being
[06:02] ready, I feel, for a larger scale uh
[06:06] awakening or an understanding of of a
[06:09] potential alternative solution to uh to
[06:12] all these
[06:13] problems. That's super interesting. I
[06:15] just had that one story in my my head
[06:18] when you were talking because when when
[06:19] you mentioned stock prices in the
[06:21] charts, I had a train ride. It was
[06:24] around 2 hours and I sat next to a guy
[06:27] who literally for two hours straight he
[06:30] looked at his phone which is not very
[06:32] common but he only looked at at stocks.
[06:35] I mean uh I only looked like three four
[06:37] times but anytime I looked there he
[06:39] looked at stocks and meme coins uh and
[06:41] and the price of it and it was so hard
[06:43] for me to ignore that because it was so
[06:45] funny that for two hours he just like
[06:47] constantly looked and just checked out
[06:49] the charts and maybe he also bought and
[06:51] and sold. I don't know what he he did
[06:53] there. Uh but it was just so interesting
[06:55] for me and I the the whole two hours I
[06:58] was just researching for my book and
[07:01] look into the printing press and and and
[07:03] how this might uh relate to Bitcoin. And
[07:07] it was such a nice contrast of two
[07:10] people sitting next to each other. The
[07:11] one really into the meme coins and fiat
[07:14] world entrenched and probably trapped in
[07:16] in the like, hey, let's make some money
[07:18] to like make whatever. I mean I I I did
[07:21] not have a conversation with him. Would
[07:23] have been maybe interesting but it it
[07:25] was an interesting uh contrast that I
[07:27] experienced there. Oh, totally. And this
[07:30] is like a completely new phenomenon, you
[07:32] know, like 30 years ago, people would
[07:34] read the paper, maybe listen to the
[07:36] radio sporadically throughout the day or
[07:39] uh watch the news at 6 p.m. at night and
[07:41] that and that was it. And people were
[07:42] not constantly plugged into the
[07:45] continual never- ending stream of global
[07:47] events. the the the continual
[07:49] fluctuation of the price of everything,
[07:51] you know, like there are so many
[07:54] conversations happening like intraday
[07:56] about like what is going on with Bitcoin
[07:58] and like you know, Bitcoin is on its way
[08:01] to becoming the global reserve currency
[08:03] and and maybe more uh sooner than we
[08:05] think and that's not something that's
[08:07] going to happen probably like inside one
[08:10] single day ever. So uh it's just a funny
[08:13] uh you know we're all products of the
[08:15] system. We all we all live in this
[08:17] society together. And I think this is
[08:19] that thing the problem of of entropy and
[08:22] money. We're all just trying to make
[08:24] sense of uh a nonsensical problem. And
[08:27] so we we get all kinds of outputs and
[08:29] all kinds of like different ways people
[08:31] are are trying to, you know, use human
[08:33] ingenuity to figure out this thing that
[08:36] just really I don't know if it can be
[08:37] figured out.
[08:39] It's super interesting as you mentioned
[08:40] that because I sometimes get the
[08:42] feedback of like oh like you record two
[08:44] weeks ahead of time. So like when we
[08:46] re-record this at like 11th of April and
[08:49] this will probably come out at beginning
[08:50] of May. So it's like an 3 weeks old
[08:53] episode. And it's super interesting
[08:56] because people have this need like oh I
[08:57] have to I have to get the this this
[09:00] conversation directly now and and right
[09:02] when it was recorded because otherwise
[09:04] it's like old news. like how how does it
[09:06] matter? Because as you said like Bitcoin
[09:09] is on the way to to be a world reserve
[09:12] asset and it's interesting to to to talk
[09:15] about the implications and then how it
[09:16] gets there but like everything else is
[09:19] is kind of noise what's what's happening
[09:21] with tariffs and the implications of
[09:22] Bitcoin and and if if Trump said that
[09:25] about Bitcoin or not or El Musk is not
[09:27] like it's it's fun to talk about but in
[09:30] the end of the day it's it's noise.
[09:32] Yeah, totally. It's
[09:34] uh 75,000 85,000 you know like we're
[09:39] going to be pricing things in Bitcoin
[09:40] one day and uh I don't know when that
[09:43] day is but uh you know I know it's
[09:45] coming. How much is this focus on on
[09:50] maybe news and this constant stream of
[09:52] information that we are so obsessed
[09:54] with? How much is this because of
[09:56] technology? because we have now the the
[10:00] possibility to do that because in the
[10:02] past we didn't even had phones and stuff
[10:04] like that where it was able to be always
[10:06] connected and in there and how much is
[10:08] it the broken money system and the the
[10:10] the high time preference.
[10:13] Yeah, I mean it's it's a great question.
[10:14] I think they are probably very
[10:16] intricately uh intertwined. um the the
[10:20] the concept of 24/7, you know,
[10:23] connection to everywhere in the world
[10:25] through a device that is you're holding
[10:27] in your hand most of the day is super
[10:29] new. And I almost think of it like how
[10:32] uh you know I'm in Canada um the the
[10:35] First Nations communities in Canada were
[10:38] um didn't have a history with alcohol
[10:41] and so alcohol was introduced into their
[10:43] societies very abruptly and they they
[10:46] didn't have the same uh you know long
[10:49] period of time of of developing the
[10:52] technology and having it then become
[10:54] sort of slowly integrated into a culture
[10:57] and so that those cultures here had
[10:59] almost no ability to uh interact with
[11:02] that uh substance and it and it just
[11:05] became a massive problem and it still is
[11:07] a massive problem here and uh I think
[11:09] the same way about cell phones and uh
[11:12] social media technology we really have
[11:15] had an explosion of these things people
[11:16] are using them probably uh you know
[11:20] without a lot of intention or
[11:22] self-reflection it becomes an automatic
[11:24] thing you don't really have an
[11:25] opportunity to unplug if you don't want
[11:26] to because this is just the nature
[11:28] future of how we communicate now. Uh but
[11:32] we are really uh truly in the very early
[11:34] stages of trying to understand what this
[11:37] is doing to human connectivity to um you
[11:41] know time preference. I I really think
[11:42] that you know social media has been a
[11:45] really uh catastrophic driver of
[11:48] diminishing our attention spans and our
[11:50] ability to focus. So, you know, like we
[11:53] used to have to wait um and when I was a
[11:56] kid, if there was a show on TV that you
[11:59] wanted to watch that was on Thursday
[12:00] night at 7:00, there was no way in the
[12:02] world to watch that show before 7:00
[12:05] p.m. on Thursday and you just had to
[12:06] wait. And then if you couldn't be there
[12:09] at 7:00, you'd set up your recorder and
[12:10] you'd watch it and then you could watch
[12:11] it on your own time after. Uh, you know,
[12:14] flash forward, we started streaming
[12:16] videos on YouTube and then, uh, you
[12:18] know, sort of shorter videos on
[12:19] Instagram. uh it came to Tik Tok and and
[12:23] like on Tik Tok it's like if you don't
[12:25] catch someone's attention within like
[12:26] three or five seconds or whatever the
[12:28] number is uh they're on to the next
[12:30] video. So like we're we're seeing this
[12:32] like intense compression of attention
[12:34] span and I and I do think it's
[12:36] intimately related to the way money is
[12:38] working. Money is a measure of energy
[12:41] and time. So when you have a money that
[12:44] is more effectively storing time, I
[12:47] think you feel more of an abundance of
[12:49] time and you feel less uh pressure on
[12:53] how you're spending your time. So we did
[12:55] used to move slower. We did used to uh
[12:58] enjoy ourselves a lot more and we didn't
[13:02] do things, you know, like those kinds of
[13:04] behaviors probably just wouldn't happen
[13:06] wouldn't have happened at that time. uh
[13:09] but now
[13:10] um I believe there's some sort of
[13:13] subconscious awareness in all of us that
[13:15] as the accelerating devaluation of money
[13:18] is happening everywhere we all
[13:20] understand that our time is being
[13:23] devalued and stolen from us and so
[13:26] because of that um there's a fear around
[13:28] how we spend the time that we do have
[13:30] and so this is why we're only willing to
[13:33] give a video 3 seconds chance because we
[13:36] we maybe that one minute that we have to
[13:38] to scroll some video for some kind of
[13:40] enjoyment is is has become that precious
[13:43] for us. It's a really sad place to be.
[13:46] And uh yeah, man, I I hope we can uh I
[13:50] hope we can cycle around and and change
[13:52] this like uh because you know, I I
[13:56] wonder what the floor is for um the the
[14:00] compression of our collective attention
[14:02] spans.
[14:04] Yeah, it's it's it's it's fascinating to
[14:06] to see um when we have and Twitter is
[14:09] becoming more and more Tik Tocky I've
[14:12] seen from the attention span that the
[14:14] content is different I feel like but the
[14:16] algorithm is is working very much the
[14:19] same I think and we we talked about it
[14:22] that before on on Twitter like paying
[14:24] people in in in Bitcoin. How how was
[14:27] your experience with with how this
[14:29] changes relationships when we now
[14:32] exchange this fiat dollar to Bitcoin
[14:36] because a lot because on a logical level
[14:39] it shouldn't change that much but I've
[14:42] seen that it changes a lot because the
[14:44] person behind could also just directly
[14:46] convert into to Bitcoin is when it's the
[14:49] same amount. How do you how was your
[14:51] experience with that? Yeah, I mean I I
[14:54] think that uh you know any kind of
[14:57] economic exchange work is a is a value
[14:59] exchange and when there is a
[15:02] subconscious understanding that the
[15:04] mechanism for that exchange has some
[15:07] kind of uh you know theft built into it
[15:09] or you know we're we're using a money
[15:12] that we would probably prefer not to if
[15:13] we didn't have to. Um I think that there
[15:16] that's going to influence the
[15:17] interaction. So it could be, you know,
[15:20] the purchase and sale of a good, but you
[15:22] know, it especially to me applies to
[15:24] like the exchange of work. And so, um,
[15:27] that's what we're trying to do. Block
[15:28] Rewards. Block Rewards is a is a Bitcoin
[15:30] only compensation and rewards software
[15:33] company. We're trying to build the
[15:35] world's best tools for paying people in
[15:37] Bitcoin. And uh, our mission statement
[15:39] is harmonizing the energy exchange of
[15:42] value creation. And I think that uh you
[15:45] know this this is really the problem
[15:46] that we need to fix because
[15:49] um you know employees continually need
[15:51] to earn more money because things are
[15:53] continually getting more expensive.
[15:54] That's not the employer's fault but it
[15:56] does create a challenge in the
[15:58] relationship for people being fairly
[16:00] rewarded for the work that they're
[16:02] doing. Um employers have to pay people
[16:05] and recognize people for the work that
[16:07] they've done so that they continue to
[16:08] work and feel excited about the work
[16:09] they're doing. And uh so so that's just
[16:13] a difficult thing to properly accomplish
[16:16] and it's nobody's fault uh except for
[16:18] the people who are continually uh
[16:20] stealing from all of us by expanding the
[16:22] money supply uh at a faster and faster
[16:24] rate. And so I think that uh you know
[16:27] I'm bullish. I we we talked about this
[16:29] offline, but I I personally think that
[16:32] the next step of Bitcoin adoption and
[16:36] creating a circular economy and
[16:37] onboarding the next massive wave of
[16:39] Bitcoiners is normalizing the concept of
[16:42] wanting to earn some Bitcoin at work.
[16:44] And it doesn't have to be uh a situation
[16:47] where people are, you know, all
[16:48] switching hard stop to a Bitcoin
[16:50] standard and they're only being paid in
[16:51] Bitcoin, but
[16:53] um Bitcoin as a reward uh in in
[16:57] interjecting Bitcoin into how we think
[17:00] about rewarding people for the work that
[17:02] they do is a really exciting start and
[17:04] something that I think has sweeping
[17:07] ramifications for companies that want to
[17:08] get on board with this idea, starting to
[17:10] think differently about how they relate
[17:13] to their employers. ers uh to their
[17:15] employees, excuse me, and how they um
[17:19] you know help their employees plan for
[17:21] the future with certainty. Employee uh
[17:23] good employers care a lot about their
[17:25] staff and their mental health and the
[17:27] well-being of their staff and they want
[17:28] their staff to stick around and be
[17:30] productive and great companies, you
[17:32] know, don't typically experience high
[17:34] turnover. They have motivated employees
[17:36] that want to come to work and and
[17:38] contribute to something bigger. And uh a
[17:41] big part of that, you know, that we see
[17:42] all the time is like companies trying to
[17:44] figure out how to offer their staff
[17:48] things that will help them feel good
[17:49] about why they're working where they
[17:51] are. And these have, you know, in the
[17:53] past been sort of, yeah, tools like
[17:55] pensions and uh savings benefits,
[17:57] bonuses, you know, there are all kinds
[17:58] of different things that companies do to
[18:00] try to get creative to help people feel
[18:02] recognized and rewarded. But to me, um,
[18:06] inside all those tools still exists that
[18:08] measure of or entropy and and disorder.
[18:11] And it's because they're just all fiat
[18:13] tools. And that that's nobody's pro
[18:14] fault. But, um, you know, if you think
[18:17] about when I go to work and I spend an
[18:20] hour of my time, like time is the single
[18:23] most finite thing that all of us have
[18:25] because eventually the one thing we have
[18:27] all in common is that we are all going
[18:29] to die. We are all going to leave this
[18:31] world. And so we do all have a finite
[18:34] amount of time. And so what we are
[18:37] really trying to do, I think most of us
[18:39] when we go to work is make the most of
[18:42] that time. So with the time that we have
[18:44] left, our free time, uh our future time
[18:46] when we hope to not work one day is that
[18:49] energy has been well spent and
[18:51] conserved. And this is what really
[18:53] Bitcoin is is offering people. uh but
[18:56] it's really what it's offering employees
[18:58] and employers is an ability to
[19:00] effectively store the energy and time
[19:02] that is contributed to something bigger
[19:05] so that those people can do that in such
[19:08] a way that they feel rewarded properly
[19:10] and feel um feel like they've made a
[19:14] good use of their time uh you know they
[19:16] they can live that simpler life right
[19:18] like this is getting back to the idea of
[19:19] like this is how people used to live and
[19:22] you know you go way back I had this
[19:24] conversation
[19:26] um uh a few weeks ago with the guys from
[19:29] Cartwright in the UK talking about uh
[19:32] you know they're doing some really cool
[19:33] things with paying people in Bitcoin
[19:34] too. And um if if you go back to that
[19:38] long 19th century, that period of high
[19:41] culture in Europe, that was really like
[19:43] predating investing. Nobody was
[19:45] investing, not workers certainly. And um
[19:49] so what people would have done is you
[19:51] would have earned money and you would
[19:54] have kind of had two choices with that
[19:55] money. You would have either saved it or
[19:57] you would have spent it. And anything
[20:00] you were probably going to save, you
[20:02] probably would have just, you know, put
[20:04] it into gold coins or precious metals.
[20:07] And the purpose for that was uh exactly
[20:10] what it's meant to be. You know, we we
[20:11] didn't used to need to gamble half of
[20:14] our money or the money that we had left
[20:16] to try and grow it into more money uh so
[20:19] that we could feel like we were
[20:20] preserving our energy and time. you know
[20:23] 100 200 years ago we would have just had
[20:25] a more effective tool for storing that
[20:28] energy and time and uh and this is why I
[20:31] think it's what has really become
[20:34] missing out of the fundamental way
[20:35] people think about financial planning is
[20:38] because we don't have effective tools
[20:41] simply for saving. we've really lost
[20:44] touch with the concept of just saving
[20:46] and even our grandparents you know would
[20:48] have you know had cash or or bonds would
[20:50] have been a more effective way of of
[20:52] lowrisk sort of low time preference uh
[20:54] tool for saving for the future
[20:57] um we need to solve the problem of being
[21:00] able to save and uh and I think Bitcoin
[21:03] is really this you know modern
[21:05] renaissance 2.0 you know, version of a
[21:07] of a savings tool. Super interesting. Um
[21:10] it's also uh interesting when we look at
[21:14] what what Bitcoin can do on a on a
[21:16] personal level with all the people that
[21:17] we already see in the Bitcoin sphere and
[21:20] then when you when you think of okay
[21:22] what happens if Bitcoin actually becomes
[21:24] mainstream and we're going from 0.5%
[21:27] adoption because I don't think we at 3
[21:29] to 4% adoption which uh a lot of people
[21:32] say uh and then we come to 50 60 70%
[21:36] adoption where most of the people um are
[21:40] into Bitcoin. It's
[21:42] also there was recently u one of my
[21:46] favorite uh guests on favorite guests
[21:48] from my audience uh on on the podcast
[21:51] Jeff Booof and for the second time and
[21:53] he said something interesting that I
[21:55] never heard someone say that clearly. He
[21:57] said if Bitcoin fails as a medium of
[21:59] exchange it will also fail as a store of
[22:02] value. Do you agree with that? That's a
[22:05] good question. Um, I am a I'm firstly
[22:08] I'm a huge fan of Jeff. Um,
[22:10] uh, and I am a monetary maximalist and I
[22:13] do think that people need to spend
[22:15] Bitcoin. Uh, I do think it needs to be
[22:17] adopted as money. I think that
[22:21] we medium exchange is something that
[22:24] follows store of value. And so what we
[22:28] don't understand because we've never
[22:30] been alive for the monetization of a
[22:33] commodity in real time is how long that
[22:36] process takes and at what point we can
[22:38] determine whether things are a success
[22:41] or have failed. So I think that Bitcoin
[22:43] right now is really proving itself out
[22:47] as a store of value and what drives
[22:51] medium of exchange over time is people's
[22:53] willingness to accept it as the broader
[22:55] understanding of store value happens.
[22:58] So, um, that there are no rules about
[23:00] this as far as I understand. And I I
[23:02] would caution to say that I I think at
[23:04] times we can get into trying
[23:08] to feel certain about how soon things
[23:11] should or shouldn't happen. U, it might
[23:14] take 50 years for Bitcoin to become a
[23:16] broadly globally understood, you know,
[23:19] prime tool for store of value. And uh
[23:22] along if it if that was true then
[23:24] probably along the way there would be
[23:26] long periods of time where a lot of
[23:28] people would feel like it has failed.
[23:30] And so I just think that we really need
[23:33] to uh try to balance um our own sort of
[23:37] internal opinions about what is urgent
[23:40] and and I think a lot of these things
[23:42] have to do with uh um yeah uh personal
[23:45] opinions uh as opposed to um you know
[23:48] nobody knows. So, uh, I agree. I think
[23:52] that we need to get to a place where
[23:53] where Bitcoin is is spent. How soon that
[23:56] needs to happen? Uh, my opinion would be
[23:59] nobody
[24:00] knows. It's it's super interesting. The
[24:03] definition of uh, Bitcoin has failed
[24:06] because it's actually not that easy. I
[24:09] mean, obviously, if if it's gone and
[24:11] there's no market that the coin doesn't
[24:13] exist and the network doesn't exist,
[24:14] then it's obvious. And beyond that
[24:18] probably it can never be really
[24:20] considered as as as as failed. Is there
[24:24] do you see Bitcoin only as failed if the
[24:27] network and the and the coin uh itself
[24:29] disappears? Yeah, I mean if there was
[24:32] some kind of like catastrophic technical
[24:33] failure in the protocol obviously that
[24:35] would be one scenario. Um, but as long
[24:39] as the fiat money system is infinitely
[24:42] inflating and some significant
[24:45] percentage of the population understand
[24:46] that a finite form of money is a way to
[24:49] insulate yourself from that problem and
[24:52] that and it works, then it's hard for me
[24:54] to understand a scenario where more and
[24:57] more people don't understand that idea
[24:58] over time. I think that it's obvious
[25:01] that that's happening. Um, at this point
[25:04] I think it's inevitable that countries
[25:07] in a large scale are going to start
[25:08] using this tool to protect from each
[25:10] other's money printing and that could
[25:13] already be very well happening at a
[25:15] significant scale like so um you have to
[25:19] remember too that the fiat system I
[25:22] believe is has no intention of going out
[25:24] easily. So medium of exchange is going
[25:27] to in my mind be the part where there is
[25:31] the most resistance from the
[25:33] establishment in the current system. So,
[25:36] you know, um essentially how I think
[25:39] it'll probably pay out play out is um
[25:42] you know, Bitcoin gets to some kind of
[25:44] absurd number. Uh it's it's just it's
[25:47] just going to pull people away from um
[25:50] wanting to use the money that is losing
[25:54] value in Bitcoin terms so quickly that
[25:56] it it becomes difficult to justify
[25:59] people to accept it. And so, you know,
[26:01] it's really at that point where where
[26:03] merchants when if we get to a point in
[26:05] time where merchants are hesitant to
[26:08] accept dollars or euros uh because of
[26:12] the you know it just makes sense to them
[26:13] that they would rather have Bitcoin that
[26:15] then all of a sudden it could happen
[26:16] very quickly. So I think store of value
[26:19] is by far the most important concept for
[26:22] the global population to grasp and I
[26:25] think that that is on track. Um, you
[26:28] know, uh, Hal and, uh, and Satoshi, you
[26:32] know, in their in their own early
[26:33] writings kind of had 2030 like pegged as
[26:36] this time, which is just such an
[26:37] interesting thing to me because, you
[26:39] know, the fourth turning was talking
[26:40] about 2030 in the '90s and uh, you know,
[26:43] the uh, the kind of globalist WF stuff
[26:46] is talking about 2030, you'll own
[26:48] nothing and be happy. So, it's almost
[26:50] like, you know, if if there's a
[26:52] simulation or or however it works, um
[26:55] we're we're moving towards a moment in
[26:57] time where there's going to be things
[26:59] that change a lot. Uh I think we are are
[27:02] in the middle of a process that's
[27:03] happening and and so it's it's really
[27:06] difficult to tell. It's not like we're
[27:07] on a train trip from Berlin to Amsterdam
[27:10] and we know exactly how long it's
[27:11] supposed to take and we can tell if
[27:13] we're ahead or behind schedule. It's uh
[27:15] it's something that is really complex
[27:18] that involves you know entities at the
[27:21] highest level and individual people at
[27:23] the at the lowest level and people all
[27:25] over the world and you know back to your
[27:27] point about you know what we're saying
[27:28] earlier about the hyperconivity of
[27:30] social media um I do you know for all of
[27:33] the things that are bad one of the
[27:35] things that is really incredible about
[27:37] it is that ideas are being shared also
[27:40] at an accelerating rate and you know
[27:42] like we've got this kind of
[27:44] intellectual kindling that is smoldering
[27:48] now and uh it's an idea right so bitcoin
[27:51] I think among other things most
[27:54] importantly is an idea and it's an idea
[27:57] about how money can be different and
[28:00] this is something that the more people
[28:03] understand it the more people there are
[28:05] to help other people understand it so
[28:07] this is really to me what the price is a
[28:10] measure of and what the store and value
[28:12] conversation the pace of the
[28:14] conversation about store value at the
[28:16] end of the day is really rooted in is um
[28:19] how many people understand this idea.
[28:21] How do you look at um unit of account
[28:24] for me like Bitcoin as a medium of
[28:27] exchange already works. So I have an
[28:30] increasingly amount of my business flow
[28:32] that I get paid in Bitcoin and directly
[28:34] pay in Bitcoin is gets bigger and bigger
[28:37] and the fiat part gets smaller and
[28:39] smaller which is amazing because in
[28:41] Bitcoin is everything so much better. I
[28:43] have people in uh Colombia and El
[28:45] Salvador with with whom I work and in
[28:48] America. So having said that, setting
[28:51] that everything up with fiat is
[28:54] complicated and expensive and with
[28:55] Bitcoin it's actually way cheaper and
[28:57] way more yeah in simpler. You just need
[29:00] an address and you just send it there.
[29:03] But I always still do everything unit of
[29:07] account in either dollars or euros
[29:10] because it's just fluctuating right now
[29:12] too much and it would be unpredictable.
[29:15] Do you have already someone that you see
[29:18] or maybe yourself where they're moving
[29:21] to a Bitcoin unit of account or is that
[29:23] just way too too too early for that?
[29:25] Yeah, I mean I I I do know people I know
[29:28] lots of people now through my travels in
[29:30] Bitcoin that totally live on a Bitcoin
[29:32] standard and
[29:34] uh measure things in Bitcoin. to me, you
[29:38] know, it really is the most abstract way
[29:41] of thinking and it requires the biggest
[29:43] change for for you to to get there. And
[29:46] so even for myself, like I would be
[29:48] lying to say that that I think about the
[29:50] world that way. So I I I wouldn't, you
[29:53] know, so for me, unit of account is by
[29:56] far the last thing that will happen. And
[29:58] that could be a really long time. And
[30:00] and if it's not, then we're in for a
[30:03] kind of a real roller coaster of
[30:05] because, you know, if all of a sudden
[30:07] people were trying to understand why
[30:09] their house that they thought was worth
[30:10] a million dollars was worth 04 bitcoin
[30:13] and like and they had to kind of catch
[30:15] up to try and figure out what that
[30:16] means, it's it's going to be really
[30:18] really uh disruptive. So um unit of
[30:20] account is like it doesn't feel like a
[30:23] very pressing or urgent problem for me.
[30:25] It is certainly something that requires
[30:27] a lot of of Bitcoin study to get there
[30:30] and I I think it's something that will
[30:32] happen more naturally. So like where we
[30:36] will probably get to and this might be
[30:38] the 2030s is where you start to see
[30:40] sidebyside prices. You know, there's
[30:42] going to have to be probably an extended
[30:44] period of time where um you're seeing
[30:47] and then you'll what you'll see instead
[30:49] of today you're trying to measure things
[30:50] in Bitcoin and seeing this fluctuation.
[30:53] Um, if you were seeing sideby-side
[30:55] prices 10 years from now, I think what
[30:57] you would see is the fiat price will be
[30:59] the one fluctuating and it will be
[31:01] fluctuating higher and higher and higher
[31:03] next to the Bitcoin price. And uh but
[31:06] but that's like a bit a much much uh
[31:10] larger and more established and uh more
[31:14] powerful Bitcoin network. Yeah, it's
[31:15] it's really I mean I do already try to
[31:19] think in terms of net worth and
[31:22] increasing my Satoshi numbers uh each
[31:25] month in in that sense in in in unit of
[31:28] count of of Bitcoin but that is just for
[31:32] myself but yeah the the the thing where
[31:35] like okay let's fix a price of that
[31:38] amount of Satoshi's you pay me or I'll
[31:40] pay you and that with the Bitcoin price
[31:44] And yeah, people say, "Yeah, one bitcoin
[31:47] is one bitcoin." But if bitcoin goes up
[31:50] from 100,000 to
[31:52] 200,000, also purchasing power of
[31:55] bitcoin goes up, not just measured in
[31:57] the US dollar. There's like an in real
[31:59] world implication of that. I mean, the
[32:02] acquisition cost, right? So, like I've
[32:03] heard stories about people who
[32:06] negotiated like very early on um
[32:09] contracts priced in Bitcoin and are now
[32:12] owed like insane amounts of money. Uh
[32:15] because so uh yeah, I mean if businesses
[32:18] need to be thinking about the
[32:19] appreciating price of Bitcoin like on a
[32:22] 5-year contract, then yeah, it's it it
[32:24] is almost has the reverse problem. So, I
[32:26] I don't know that it's even really
[32:28] possible right now given the current uh
[32:31] state we are in the long-term evolution
[32:33] of Bitcoin.
[32:35] I would be very cautious when like
[32:38] someone comes, oh, please pay me in
[32:40] Bitcoin and we set out a price in
[32:42] Bitcoin per month for the next like two
[32:44] years. I'm like, I I don't know if I can
[32:46] pay that in two years. Yeah. Yeah.
[32:48] Totally. I mean, the only way you could
[32:50] is if all of your contracts were also
[32:52] denominated totally in Bitcoin. And but
[32:55] uh yeah, I I I would be hesitant too. I
[32:57] wouldn't blame you. Let's take a break
[32:59] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[33:02] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[33:05] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[33:07] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[33:10] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[33:13] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[33:16] completely new and amazing Genesis
[33:18] edition of their watch collections. You
[33:21] have the date of the first ever mined
[33:24] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[33:27] also the block height and which epoch we
[33:30] are currently in. I love the level of
[33:33] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[33:36] Make sure to check out those amazing
[33:38] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[33:41] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[33:44] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[33:47] really do hope that you don't have it on
[33:49] exchange. But if you do have it on
[33:51] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[33:53] deal with that. The first way is you put
[33:55] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[33:57] entry for you to get into the
[33:59] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[34:03] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[34:05] super simple and secure way. And if you
[34:08] check out the link in the description,
[34:10] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[34:13] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[34:16] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[34:19] partner in terms of how to get the most
[34:22] out of your sovereignty. They will
[34:25] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[34:28] that is perfect for your individual
[34:31] situation. They will show you how you
[34:33] can secure your own devices. Securing
[34:36] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[34:38] have to keep all your devices secure.
[34:40] One topic that is overlooked often is
[34:43] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[34:45] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[34:48] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[34:51] place already? And last but not least,
[34:53] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[34:55] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[34:57] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[35:02] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[35:05] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[35:08] be for the first time ever speaking at
[35:10] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[35:13] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:16] really looking forward to seeing all of
[35:18] you there. You can get your ticket in
[35:20] the link down in the description of
[35:22] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[35:25] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[35:28] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[35:30] there. Um, one thing that is interesting
[35:33] when we look at the Bitcoin world
[35:36] emerging with with the fiat world and
[35:38] using the feared games to get more
[35:41] Bitcoin with credits, with mortgages,
[35:45] with all those things. I mean, we have a
[35:47] famous example with Michael Sailor that
[35:49] plays that game probably better than
[35:50] than anyone else. But there are a lot of
[35:53] people that uh that do those with
[35:56] mortgaging their home, even with
[35:58] consumer credits. We had one guy on that
[36:00] uh just maxed out all the credit cards
[36:03] and and just bought more Bitcoin and and
[36:05] he tracked everything in Excel sheet for
[36:06] like 2 three years and it worked out
[36:08] amazing for him even with a high
[36:11] interest rates but it's it's a dangerous
[36:13] play. How do you how do you look at
[36:16] using the fiat system
[36:19] um at and and using it in a way to to
[36:23] get more Bitcoin? Is that Bitcoin alike
[36:25] or is is that just playing dumb games to
[36:28] to maybe win a stupid price? Uh yeah,
[36:32] that's a great question. I I I think of
[36:34] it as like you know it's um it's
[36:38] just being smart in my opinion of you
[36:42] know we can't do anything about the
[36:44] infinite creation of fiat money uh other
[36:47] than take that money hose and plug it
[36:50] into it's like if you had uh a leaf
[36:53] blower that had an neverending amount of
[36:56] air to be sucked into it and you had a
[36:57] balloon that could take all of the air
[37:00] in the world. uh you would be crazy to
[37:02] not do that. And so that's what I really
[37:04] think of Bitcoiners who are doing all
[37:05] these various strategies. You know, if
[37:08] you understand Bitcoin, you know that
[37:10] our money is going to be intentionally
[37:12] devalued and the rate at which it
[37:14] becomes devalued is going to accelerate.
[37:16] So the smartest thing you can do is get
[37:18] as much of you of it as you can as fast
[37:20] as you can and put it into the thing
[37:23] that is going to you know uh be able to
[37:26] absorb as much of that monetary
[37:28] expansion as possible. So, so that's
[37:30] really what Bitcoin is. And I think that
[37:33] people, yeah, we'll look back uh at
[37:36] people like Sailor and understand that
[37:38] they were visionaries and that they
[37:40] understood something very important uh
[37:42] earlier than almost everybody. And uh
[37:44] this is I know kind of I think it's the
[37:48] thing that ends up really highlighting
[37:51] or exposing the fatal flaw of fiat
[37:53] money. It's like a It's like a a global
[37:57] short squeeze on paper money printing.
[38:00] And so th this happens when sort of an
[38:03] an uncontrollable amount of fiat money
[38:07] starts being pushed into into Bitcoin.
[38:10] And that thing, you know, triggers
[38:13] eventually sort of like a herd
[38:15] mentality, panic to push all of a sudden
[38:18] all of the money in. And that's when the
[38:20] game is over. like it's uh so I think
[38:23] these people especially you know Sailor
[38:25] and and some of the other institutions
[38:26] that are doing it because of the amount
[38:28] of money that they have to do it and the
[38:30] high-profile nature of who they are are
[38:33] like really important catalysts in
[38:35] starting that kind of herd stampede um
[38:38] you know they the other people will
[38:39] follow and if Bitcoin goes to some kind
[38:42] of insane price uh whether it's this
[38:44] year or in four years and sailors manage
[38:47] to hold his entire stack for that time
[38:49] Micro Strategy will be the most valuable
[38:52] company in the world. And when that
[38:54] happens, um, a bunch of executives that,
[38:57] you know, Fortune 500 companies, Fortune
[38:58] 1000 companies are going to have to
[39:01] either do the same or explain to their
[39:04] shareholders and their boards why they
[39:06] didn't have the same idea or why they
[39:08] thought about it and decided not to. And
[39:10] uh so the there's you know all kinds of
[39:12] like really interesting game theory
[39:14] scenarios that uh I think people very
[39:18] powerful people maybe don't know are
[39:20] happening and aren't aware that they're
[39:22] not participating in but they kind of
[39:24] are participating in it by choosing you
[39:26] know like uh Apple and there've been a
[39:28] few other big companies that considered
[39:31] um Treasury and and decline and uh
[39:35] that's all part of it too. So,
[39:38] um, I'm bullish, man. And I think like
[39:41] game, you know, GameStop is a is a
[39:43] really interesting example, uh, because
[39:46] of who they are and the sort of like
[39:48] mimemetic nature of the recent history
[39:51] of that company, but also the, um, the
[39:54] kinds of people who are buying the
[39:58] Gamestock stock as a way to, you know,
[40:01] say screw you to the hedge fund
[40:03] shorters. And uh you know, you put
[40:06] GameStop and Bitcoin together and you
[40:08] could really have a have an explosive
[40:10] kickoff to uh a a force rethink of how
[40:14] companies think about holding Bitcoin.
[40:17] The Yeah, it's it's it's a game start.
[40:20] No, it's a game on uh like it's it's
[40:23] really interesting. I I love your leaf
[40:26] blower example. It it it makes it so it
[40:29] it makes it really magical because we
[40:32] we're blowing the that air in into
[40:34] Bitcoin. I
[40:36] mean, a balloon would eventually um uh
[40:40] blast if you do it too much, but Bitcoin
[40:44] is like this balloon that could take all
[40:45] of the air in the world. So it's like uh
[40:48] yeah I mean I think back to this example
[40:50] of like the earlier thought about
[40:52] entropy like we're talking about uh like
[40:55] a you know uh a chemical reaction where
[40:59] there's an unintentional byproduct of
[41:01] heat and that heat it's like a light
[41:03] bulb that's meant to only make light but
[41:05] it also gets hot. And so there's energy
[41:08] wasted when when that happens. And if
[41:11] you had a system instead that used all
[41:14] of the energy that was being put in for
[41:16] the useful purpose of the thing, then
[41:20] that's like a, you know, a perfect uh a
[41:23] perfect system, a system that has no
[41:25] wasted energy. And so that system can't
[41:29] help but perform in a superior way to
[41:32] the system that has waste. So um this is
[41:35] like, you know, back to this argument
[41:36] about medium of exchange. You know, I
[41:39] think that it's happening like Bitcoin
[41:42] is doing it. It's just like that we all
[41:44] have to also kind of like wrestle with
[41:47] the reality that we live in this hyper
[41:50] low time a high time preference society
[41:52] and all of us like even if we can escape
[41:57] it to some degree and take a longer term
[42:00] view of things, we do still walk around
[42:03] every day in this like cell phone Tik
[42:06] Tok society and that's going to affect
[42:08] everyone and it's going to make us all
[42:11] experience some level of urgency. to
[42:13] think things need to happen probably
[42:15] faster than they do.
[42:17] Absolutely.
[42:19] Uh it's like we have to be patient with
[42:22] it and and we we I I see sometimes with
[42:26] Bitcoiners and and and people are
[42:28] getting upset because the price has been
[42:31] down for like 3 weeks and I'm like yeah
[42:33] like look look out for the five year
[42:35] development look out for the 10 year
[42:36] development. It's it's just like
[42:38] short-term thing. Go ride a bike. Go go
[42:42] go go go ride a bike. I love that. Um,
[42:44] you wrote the and we talked about it in
[42:46] the in the in the last episode with you,
[42:49] the DA of Bitcoin. And I saw you also
[42:52] wrote now a new book called Bitcoin for
[42:56] financial advisors. How did that come to
[42:59] be? Like why why did you write that?
[43:02] Yeah, so I actually wrote that book
[43:03] first. Uh, that was my first You Oh,
[43:06] interesting. I did not knew that. Yeah.
[43:08] uh you know that book kind of came out
[43:10] quietly with uh with little fanfare. I
[43:13] was pretty early in my own Bitcoin
[43:15] journey. My personal story you know and
[43:17] how all this stuff started. I was in
[43:19] traditional finance for the majority of
[43:21] my career. I can have 15 years uh in
[43:25] financial services retail and most of
[43:26] the work that I was doing was around
[43:28] compensation rewards pension plan
[43:30] consulting and I found Bitcoin in 2020
[43:33] because I was worried about the impact
[43:36] of money printing on fixed income uh
[43:39] specifically as how bond markets would
[43:42] relate inside uh asset uh portfolios for
[43:46] pensions. So uh because of that like my
[43:49] entire social professional social
[43:51] network were financial adviserss and I
[43:54] got orange peeled and I started running
[43:55] around in 2020 talking to everybody
[43:57] about how Bitcoin was going to be this
[43:59] thing that was going to totally change
[44:00] the way pensions worked and the way we
[44:02] thought about you know portfolio
[44:04] allocation and uh it seemed so obvious
[44:07] to me and basically what happened was
[44:09] like over three or six months I had like
[44:12] you know 50 or 100 people tell me I've
[44:13] like totally gone off the deep end and
[44:15] I'm completely insane. And you know this
[44:17] is like when Bitcoin was like I don't
[44:18] know 16,000
[44:21] uh you know it's very different times
[44:22] right to go back to your like tell me
[44:24] about 5 years. So um so I wrote that
[44:27] book mostly as I just wanted to have a
[44:30] way to condense all of those
[44:32] conversations I've had into a single
[44:34] conversation. So, it's kind of like a
[44:36] casual Bitcoin read geared at uh people
[44:39] who have a background selling
[44:41] traditional financial services products.
[44:43] And uh you know, it's definitely has a
[44:45] Canadian slant. So, it could have been
[44:47] called Bitcoin for Canadian financial
[44:50] advisors, but I I have had people who've
[44:52] read it in Australia, the UK, and it,
[44:54] you know, it's kind of similar enough
[44:56] that I I think the book works. But, you
[44:58] know, it was really from there that was
[45:00] when uh I I learned a lot writing that
[45:03] book. And it was that book that that
[45:04] prepped me to write D Bitcoin, which is
[45:06] a book that I feel is like, you know,
[45:08] kind of much more clearly uh articulates
[45:11] my my personal feelings about what's
[45:12] going on and uh something I I resonate
[45:15] with a lot more. So I I so I actually
[45:17] don't talk about uh the first book a ton
[45:19] and that's probably why you thought it
[45:20] was new because I uh it's kind of out
[45:22] there. Uh if people want to read it,
[45:24] it's it's on Amazon, but uh yeah, I uh
[45:28] Dow Bitcoin is kind of my baby. Yeah, I
[45:31] was uh I was seeing it today because I
[45:33] we talked last time about the Dow of
[45:35] Bitcoin. I think the whole episode was
[45:37] was basically around around that book.
[45:39] Uh and I was was going to to your
[45:41] website and I saw the second one. I was
[45:42] like, "Oh, he brought brought out a new
[45:44] book and I was really curious like
[45:45] financial advice. It's an it's an
[45:47] interesting it was a weird step from the
[45:49] DA of
[45:50] Bitcoin financial advisor." So So I was
[45:53] I was curious about that. Really
[45:55] interesting. also had I think like three
[45:58] four like certified financial advisors
[46:00] already on on the show and it's it's
[46:04] super interesting always this uh
[46:06] conversations of isn't Bitcoin kind of
[46:11] demolishing the financial advisor if we
[46:15] can save again in Bitcoin and it's
[46:17] obvious and we we don't need a portfolio
[46:19] manager yeah maybe we need tax advisor
[46:23] maybe we need other things in the field
[46:24] world but Yeah, maybe even taxes are
[46:26] getting uh less and a little bit
[46:29] simplified in that world. H how do you
[46:32] think is the role of of of financial
[46:34] advisers in a in in a post Bitcoin world
[46:36] or like in a Bitcoin world? Yeah, I
[46:39] agree with you. I think probably mostly
[46:41] gone. Um you know, these
[46:44] are and it's not to disparrage anybody.
[46:47] I I just think that they're sort of like
[46:49] it's a profession that is going to
[46:52] become a little bit dated. So we, you
[46:54] know, we will still need tax planning
[46:55] and insurance planning. Um, but the case
[46:59] to be made for gambling on a basket of
[47:02] companies instead of just saving your
[47:05] money when there is a global
[47:07] understanding around a preferred tool
[47:08] for saving is is going to be hard for
[47:10] people to bite. And we have really
[47:13] normalized investing. Uh, and even
[47:16] that's something that's really changed a
[47:17] lot. So, um, you know, it it was kind of
[47:21] the 60/40 portfolio and people used to
[47:24] have a mix of stocks and bonds and then
[47:26] they would also just have some savings
[47:29] and sort of a broad trend that I think
[47:31] is fair to say has happened mostly
[47:33] everywhere in the Western world over the
[47:35] last 20 or 30 years is a migration to
[47:39] most of the portfolios for people and
[47:41] certainly with um, you know,
[47:42] self-directed investing becoming a much
[47:44] more common thing is people being
[47:47] entirely ly allocated to stocks and uh
[47:50] that becoming a very normal idea. So
[47:52] that that's also something that's really
[47:53] new. I don't think that that's
[47:56] sustainable and I also don't think it
[47:57] makes any sense like you know we have a
[48:00] lot of we have tons of zombie companies
[48:02] in every major economy in the world. um
[48:06] the way the global economy is just
[48:09] changing with so much that it's really
[48:12] not the same environment that we had in
[48:14] the 70s or 80s um where you know you
[48:17] might be able to pick companies and feel
[48:20] certain that they were going to be
[48:21] around in 20 or 30 years 50 years you
[48:24] know I I think that uh I think people
[48:27] are going to just have to think about
[48:28] accumulating wealth differently and if
[48:31] you have a form of money that has a
[48:34] fixed set of rules
[48:35] and you're able to accumulate that that
[48:37] is like accumulating gold coins in 1850.
[48:41] And that is something that probably if
[48:44] given the choice between truly being
[48:46] able to save and having to gamble,
[48:50] um I think most people would probably
[48:52] choose save because most people are kind
[48:54] of more riskaverse. Not everybody's
[48:57] trying to become rich. Most people are
[48:59] trying to protect their energy and time.
[49:00] So I think that the way we think about
[49:04] planning for the future is going to
[49:05] change a lot and it's going to remove a
[49:08] lot of the products that have been
[49:10] created these sort of hyper
[49:12] financialized
[49:13] uh hyper fiat products and uh and I
[49:17] think that
[49:18] um it's just going to get a lot simpler
[49:21] uh for for the people who want it to be
[49:23] simpler. I sometimes think
[49:24] that when we get to Bitcoin somewhere
[49:28] along in the transition period, there
[49:32] must be either a gradual or sudden wipe
[49:36] out event of all those zombie companies
[49:38] of all that bloated feared system and it
[49:42] will be really cruel for people that
[49:46] don't get Bitcoin but are very exposed
[49:48] to to to Fiat. It's it sometimes it
[49:51] worries me. Yeah, I I don't disagree
[49:54] with you. I think that uh it's possible
[49:57] we're also on a collision course for
[49:59] some kind of an event that could be
[50:01] driven by AI uh where there there comes
[50:04] a moment in time where all of a sudden
[50:06] uh you know AI employees, robots, I mean
[50:09] there's just going to be a ton of change
[50:11] and I don't know how soon it's going to
[50:13] happen but um I think we're headed for a
[50:16] very different landscape with with work
[50:19] with uh zombie companies with fiat
[50:22] products like the whole thing and this
[50:25] is kind of another Jeff Booth idea,
[50:27] right? Is this the the ultimate
[50:29] challenge of the solveny of the system
[50:32] is that it requires the price of
[50:33] everything to go up forever. And if if
[50:37] the if the credit based nature of how we
[50:40] built everything
[50:42] uh implodes, um everything has to go.
[50:45] So, uh nobody's house is worth what they
[50:49] think it's worth. I mean, that doesn't
[50:50] mean you can't sell it for the price
[50:52] that you think it's worth now.
[50:54] But um all of these asset prices are
[50:58] just a weird sort of abstraction of um
[51:02] the permanently expanding supply of
[51:05] money.
[51:07] How do you actually uh I mean it's a a
[51:09] totally unrelated a little bit unrelated
[51:11] question, but how do you actually use uh
[51:13] AI? Do do you you probably use it in
[51:15] some capacity? Yeah. Uh we use it a lot
[51:18] for research. Uh, I'd say that the where
[51:20] we're using it most today is for
[51:22] research and it's incredible. You know,
[51:24] you can you can get it to digest
[51:25] different documents. I've been really
[51:28] shocked at times of how AI how the AI
[51:31] tools have the ability to like remember
[51:34] the different conversations you've had
[51:35] and start to make inferences about how
[51:38] these things work together. And like a
[51:40] really specific example I could share is
[51:42] uh you know I'm talking to Chad GBT all
[51:45] the time about block rewards and and uh
[51:47] you know our different products and how
[51:49] we can you know write copy about the
[51:50] products how we might build ads and you
[51:52] know so it's obviously built some kind
[51:54] of understanding of of what we're doing
[51:57] and a couple weeks ago I was asking it
[51:59] uh we weren't talking about block
[52:01] rewards and I asked it for a a model if
[52:05] it could build me a model for um how
[52:09] software as a service companies think
[52:10] about staffing salespeople and it
[52:13] replied, "Sure, do you want me to build
[52:15] you uh a s a staffing model for block
[52:18] rewards and bitcoin savings plan?" And
[52:20] so it did that on its own. And uh which
[52:22] is pretty wild. you know, these are like
[52:24] very small examples, but uh yeah, I
[52:27] mean, we are super bullish on the idea
[52:31] that that AI and are going to be paid
[52:34] and they're going to be paid in Bitcoin
[52:35] and and this is something that we have
[52:37] on our internal roadmap at Block Rewards
[52:39] 2. I think that uh some of the some of
[52:42] these ideas might seem pretty weird, but
[52:45] uh this is this is from what I've seen,
[52:48] I think this is the future we're headed
[52:49] towards. It's also if if you think about
[52:53] if you there are already the beginning
[52:57] stages of AI agents that just do things
[52:59] fool you with you interacting with it
[53:02] and this will just get crazier faster
[53:05] better and more humanlike than ever. uh
[53:08] an AI agent probably can can at some
[53:12] point or very soon replace an entry-
[53:15] level job. Uh like you had you had to
[53:17] get some assistant or some someone for
[53:19] that and you just employ that AI agent
[53:21] pay a couple hundred bucks maybe per
[53:23] month versus a couple thousand bucks per
[53:26] per month the AI agent and then it's
[53:28] also interesting what if that AI agent
[53:30] works together with another AI agent.
[53:33] It's so natural for them to use Bitcoin.
[53:35] Why why would they have a fiat account?
[53:37] They won't. And to me, like it's obvious
[53:40] that AI will understand Bitcoin before
[53:42] humanity does because it's just it's
[53:45] just the most rational choice. And this
[53:48] is entirely, you know, a AI will be able
[53:51] to remove any of the feeling around it
[53:52] and it will just make the most rational
[53:54] decision. So AI will transact in
[53:57] Bitcoin. AI will accumulate Bitcoin. Uh
[54:00] you know, Max Kaiser has been talking
[54:01] about this for a really long time.
[54:02] there's sort of this bigger idea that AI
[54:06] and Bitcoin are kind of like the
[54:07] yin-yang like they're actually
[54:09] intrinsically linked. And I also think
[54:10] this is a fascinating notion about uh
[54:13] the concept of the singularity and where
[54:16] uh we might go with a future
[54:18] civilization synergy with AI is that AI
[54:21] has this um unlimited hunger for energy
[54:25] consumption for an endless growth of
[54:28] compute. and sort of the only real check
[54:32] and balance to that system is something
[54:35] that is a you know an infinite um
[54:39] consumer of energy that can that can
[54:40] price energy. And so um I think that I
[54:44] think that there's there's a natural
[54:46] harmony and synergy between uh between
[54:49] AI and and Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
[54:51] network. And I think that we I had a
[54:54] really interesting conversation uh a few
[54:56] months ago with um Jesse Schrader from
[54:59] Ambos Technologies and he'd be a great
[55:01] guest for you if you have never talked
[55:02] to Jesse. Uh awesome guy. And Ambos is
[55:05] building uh an AI tool that uh
[55:09] automatically rebalances uh uh lightning
[55:12] channels liquidity. And so they envision
[55:14] sort of a a a global system where AI is
[55:19] is automatically rebalancing lightning
[55:21] channels to make sure that large
[55:23] payments at scale h never experience
[55:26] failure. And uh you know so this is like
[55:29] one of one really specific example where
[55:31] I think we can imagine a future where
[55:34] where AI and Bitcoin almost become fused
[55:36] together and uh and this kind of becomes
[55:38] like the backbone for um kind of post
[55:42] fiat world.
[55:44] I just brought it up. I think I had him
[55:46] on the podcast. Let's uh let's show it
[55:48] to people. You've had everybody
[55:50] on so many pods. But uh if you're
[55:54] listening uh check that episode out. You
[55:56] can check out my episode with Jesse. Uh,
[55:59] you know, super smart guy, very uh, very
[56:02] entertaining. Absolutely. He he is
[56:05] really really good and and it was an
[56:06] amazing um um amazing episode. We talked
[56:10] about the machine economy and it was
[56:12] it's such an amazing term machine
[56:14] economy. I've never heard it before and
[56:17] then he he talked about it uh, which was
[56:19] yeah absolutely cool and and I can just
[56:22] I can just re recommend this guy also.
[56:25] Uh, Jesse, it was was really cool to to
[56:27] have him on the podcast. But yeah, now
[56:29] I'm I I'm approaching 500 different
[56:33] guests on the podcast. So, if you wonder
[56:36] if I had him on, most likely I had him
[56:38] on.
[56:40] Really cool. I love that. Um that's
[56:44] that's really cool. Um, one thing I want
[56:46] uh before we end the podcast, I want to
[56:49] get your your take on um is kind of
[56:52] where we are currently in Bitcoin and
[56:55] what happened since the last episode.
[56:57] You you've been on I think a year, a
[56:59] little bit over a year, maybe even uh on
[57:01] on the podcast and so much has happened
[57:04] since then. How do you look at reaching
[57:06] 100k Trump uh and all the things that
[57:08] that happened in Bitcoin?
[57:11] Great question. Yeah, you know, I I one
[57:13] I think it's a it's astounding that we
[57:16] breached 100,000 and uh you know, almost
[57:19] hit 110 and like basically nobody cared
[57:23] like the world didn't really you know
[57:25] notice there was no FOMO. It just is
[57:28] something that happened and you know I
[57:30] think like
[57:31] Samson's idea that we are going to now
[57:35] like the next step is really to just
[57:37] start talking about it as.1 M. it. You
[57:40] know, I think I think this is kind of
[57:41] where we're headed. Again, I think these
[57:43] things take time, but like it was very
[57:45] shortly after the 100,000 Bitcoin that,
[57:49] you know, the the um the the Trump
[57:52] administration and kind of what we've
[57:55] seen since, regardless of what the price
[57:58] action of Bitcoin has done during the
[57:59] time, like, you know, there's a lot of
[58:01] moving pieces in the global financial
[58:04] markets right now. we're in really sort
[58:05] of uncharted waters and I think Bitcoin
[58:08] has held up incredibly well and who
[58:11] knows like you said we air this in two
[58:12] weeks things could look a lot different
[58:14] but um yeah I mean I think that the
[58:17] world is starting to converge around the
[58:19] idea that Bitcoin is a safe haven and uh
[58:23] all of the elements are there for um
[58:27] some people to decide that sooner than
[58:29] others at a large scale so what do I
[58:33] think has been going on I think it's
[58:34] incredible And it it's the funniest, you
[58:37] know, kind of bull market, you know, and
[58:38] I've only been around for two. Um, I
[58:41] will say what I've seen so far is and
[58:45] you know it it really is and this is
[58:47] like an idea that I talk a lot about in
[58:49] Dow Bitcoin is like that
[58:52] urgency for something to happen is
[58:55] something that is an internal like
[58:57] that's happening for a collection of
[58:59] people inside them and nothing about
[59:02] what that is happening like nothing
[59:03] about that emotion will really impact um
[59:07] you know what Bitcoin does other than to
[59:09] A uh if we all start to take certain
[59:13] actions as a result of that internal
[59:14] feeling then yeah like if everyone
[59:16] started panic selling the price would go
[59:17] down. Um, but ultimately this thing is
[59:22] unfolding on its own. And like I said, I
[59:25] I think it's I think we're at a super
[59:27] probably the most exciting time ever.
[59:29] And it's also true at the same time that
[59:32] most people seem really frustrated. And
[59:34] the average person seems to think that
[59:36] Bitcoin is like, "Oh, I noticed that
[59:39] it's down a lot, which is uh, you know,
[59:42] these like simultaneously true
[59:45] absurdities about uh this is how Bitcoin
[59:48] is." So, man, I I would it wouldn't
[59:50] surprise me at all if if Bitcoin was,
[59:54] you know, a really crazy price like this
[59:57] year. And that might also not be true.
[60:00] But I think that um whatever happens, in
[60:04] my opinion, it will happen um when
[60:06] people release the expectation of it
[60:08] happening or when they feel like finally
[60:11] that it's not going to happen, that's
[60:14] probably when it will happen.
[60:16] Bitcoin always does what what you don't
[60:19] expect it. Yeah. And and nobody knows,
[60:21] you know, like Jack doesn't know. Jeff
[60:24] doesn't know. You know, these people and
[60:26] they have really insightful opinions,
[60:28] that doesn't mean they're wrong. It's
[60:29] just that like it's just true that
[60:31] nobody knows. So, um, as much as we want
[60:35] to know, you know, we and we we all want
[60:38] to listen to people that we think know,
[60:41] nobody does. Nobody knows. Absolutely.
[60:43] we we are only directionally right and
[60:47] not like in like oh Bitcoin will hit
[60:49] this because as you mentioned Samson and
[60:52] and it will have him on probably in
[60:53] Prague. I'm really looking forward to
[60:55] that uh for the first time ever. Uh but
[60:58] uh he he said like oh like when we reach
[61:01] the 100k we will rip through a million I
[61:05] think something like that. He said he's
[61:06] also talking about the omega candle and
[61:08] I think actually he might be probably
[61:10] right that that at some point comes like
[61:12] a really huge event where like people
[61:16] are like oh [ __ ] like something like a
[61:18] second time
[61:20] 2017 but he does not know uh which year
[61:23] and what what it triggers it might just
[61:25] happen or might not just have. Yeah. One
[61:27] thing um we talked so much about uh the
[61:30] DA of Bitcoin and uh our previous
[61:33] episode I just for for people that are
[61:34] curious that's a title the world on a
[61:37] Bitcoin standard Scott Dles if you type
[61:39] in Scott Dles Bitcoin Robin you you find
[61:41] it instantly on on on on YouTube uh if
[61:45] you if you don't have enough of of the
[61:46] both of us already uh you can get
[61:48] another hour in India uh right now so uh
[61:53] looking forward to that um yeah thank
[61:54] you so much uh Scott already for your
[61:56] insights But uh we have a we have a
[61:58] question that I asked each and every one
[62:00] of my guests. Uh and this is newer. This
[62:02] I didn't ask you this last time I think.
[62:05] Uh and the question is what can we learn
[62:07] from you besides Bitcoin? Uh sure. I
[62:10] would say um you know the the other
[62:12] things that I spend a lot of time like
[62:14] tweeting about and talking about are
[62:16] things to do with um kind of
[62:18] consciousness and the nature of reality.
[62:20] And this definitely relates into
[62:22] spirituality and dowoism. Uh these are
[62:24] topics I'm I'm really interested in. I'm
[62:26] really passionate about I I talk about
[62:29] them. Um so so that's uh if if you're
[62:33] interested in the in other stuff I might
[62:36] talk about that's things you might find
[62:38] uh yeah really really cool and as you
[62:42] know uh as we also had last time we have
[62:44] an end routine in the podcast where the
[62:46] previous guest is asking a question for
[62:48] the next guest without knowing who the
[62:49] next guest actually is. And the previous
[62:51] guest uh is asked you the question,
[62:54] what's something that you used to be
[62:57] afraid of that you no longer worry about
[63:00] in Bitcoin and why? H
[63:05] um I think that that I would say I used
[63:09] to be worried about uh quantum
[63:13] computing. I'll choose quantum
[63:15] computing. And
[63:18] um how what what what I where I am at
[63:21] with it today is uh ultimately I think
[63:24] that uh it's an unknown. It's an unknown
[63:28] of uh potential arrival. It's um
[63:33] something that I think Bitcoin I' I
[63:36] would say I've become more confident in
[63:38] talking to different Bitcoiners around
[63:41] um what they think Bitcoiners may be
[63:44] able to solve as a response. And so I I
[63:47] feel like for people who are kind of
[63:49] quantum doomers that uh there's a lot of
[63:52] thought already going into potential
[63:54] solutions. And it's also true that it
[63:57] could either never happen or or it could
[64:00] be much farther into the future than
[64:02] than we than we think. And so uh so that
[64:05] would that would probably be probably be
[64:07] mine. That's super interesting. Yeah. My
[64:10] my big thing is mining centralization.
[64:13] When I came into Bitcoin in 2020, I
[64:16] think 70 or over 70% was in China. And
[64:20] then China made the really cool decision
[64:24] to make the Bitcoin network stronger and
[64:26] more decentralized uh while they are
[64:29] banning Bitcoin mining in in China. And
[64:31] now I think the biggest country that has
[64:33] the most mining is probably America with
[64:35] around like 30 to 40%. I mean there's
[64:38] still topics with mining pools and the
[64:41] mining templates but I think ocean is
[64:44] working really good uh on that topic and
[64:46] there are other uh really great people
[64:48] that work on that. So it's it's super
[64:51] interesting how we have those those
[64:53] beliefs of like oh that's that what I'm
[64:55] worrying about and and uh three four
[64:59] five years later you're like okay this
[65:00] is also soft this is also soft this is
[65:02] also solved bitcoin apparently is isn't
[65:05] isn't going to be destroyed. No. Yeah,
[65:09] totally. That's a great one. You know, I
[65:11] I uh yeah, I think that
[65:14] uh the mining conversation is is
[65:17] fascinating and uh uh there are some
[65:20] really cool things about how it it's
[65:23] like it's like an organism. You know,
[65:24] this thing is uh built for built for
[65:26] survival. It's built for evolution and
[65:29] uh and it depends on the uh innate
[65:31] ingenuity of the of the people who are
[65:34] trying to make it better all the time.
[65:35] It is it's so cool.
[65:38] Absolutely. 100% agreed. Um, really
[65:41] cool. Thank you so much, Scott, for for
[65:42] your time. Before I let you go, where
