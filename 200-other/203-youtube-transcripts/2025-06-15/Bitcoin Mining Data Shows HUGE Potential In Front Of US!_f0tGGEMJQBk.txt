[00:00] hash rate is an indication of where
[00:02] people think that the future of Bitcoin
[00:04] is going if you see the hash rate start
[00:06] to fall off that means that people are
[00:09] finding other mechanisms to put their
[00:11] investment dollars into so we are seeing
[00:14] still rapid growth in development of
[00:17] Bitcoin mining and that's positive for
[00:19] Bitcoin that means that bitcoiners are
[00:22] being able to attract investors being
[00:24] able to continue to build infrastructure
[00:26] and they have a positive future outlook
[00:28] on on the landscape of Bitcoin mining
[00:30] the smartest people always jump on an
[00:33] investment when it doesn't look the best
[00:35] who made the most money the people that
[00:37] built during the low cycle and ramped up
[00:39] production enough into the high cycle
[00:42] miners that are able to profit the most
[00:44] are able to build and raise capital and
[00:47] build and deploy megawatts during the
[00:49] hardest times of
[00:51] [Music]
[00:55] mining you just told me that you are in
[00:57] the business of repairing
[01:00] uh Bitcoin A6 you're trying to educate
[01:03] people on on how to to to repair this
[01:05] how did you get here like why are you
[01:08] specifically excited of about repairing
[01:10] A6 so great story I thank you for asking
[01:14] so we started about five years ago now
[01:17] looking for something else we found
[01:19] Bitcoin and like every other bitcoiner
[01:21] right we go down the rabbit hole pretty
[01:23] hard so uh I started as a home Miner we
[01:27] developed uh a little mini Data Center
[01:29] and a 6x6 closet I had 11 tons of air
[01:32] conditioning inside of it and we ran 9
[01:34] as6 and then from there we kind of
[01:37] realized that we needed to there that
[01:39] the industry needed support in a lot of
[01:41] the the the vendor relationships that
[01:43] didn't exist yet so we then started
[01:47] taking clients in our two-car garage we
[01:49] started fixing A6 went got a little bit
[01:51] of training from random sources but then
[01:54] started fixing taking customers on in
[01:56] our garage from there we went to Orlando
[01:59] we learned and studied under an IPC
[02:01] certification Center to learn how to do
[02:03] micro soldering uh a Prof at a
[02:06] professional level we grew our team
[02:08] there to about seven seven full-time
[02:11] employees taking on pallets and pallets
[02:14] of as6 at a time and um and then from
[02:17] there we moved into a education platform
[02:21] because we really wanted people to be
[02:22] able to do this themselves we the the
[02:25] biggest value ad for our industry that
[02:28] we saw was giving operators the
[02:31] opportunity to learn how to do all the
[02:33] things that we had just learned over
[02:35] years of self-education and going
[02:37] through all the processes and systems
[02:39] and creating all the uh a Workforce
[02:42] right so we want to help create a
[02:43] broader Workforce in the Bitcoin
[02:46] industry Bitcoin mining industry and so
[02:49] our our passion is uh a Relentless
[02:52] pursuit of excellence and whatever it is
[02:54] we do and doing it with unreasonable
[02:57] Hospitality like how do we bring people
[02:59] into this space giving people an
[03:01] opportunity to have a career path and
[03:03] doing it in a way in which that it
[03:05] doesn't feel like they're just drudging
[03:07] through and trying to trying to learn
[03:09] something like in traditional Academia
[03:11] right we want to be that that bridge
[03:14] that skill Bridge uh between where
[03:17] people are they want to get into Bitcoin
[03:19] and Bitcoin mining as a career but they
[03:21] don't know where to go we want to be
[03:22] that solution for
[03:24] them interesting so it's more for
[03:27] probably smaller operations and solo
[03:30] as as I assume that really big farms
[03:33] have some contracts going on where they
[03:35] can just send it back or like how is it
[03:37] actually working of like if there's
[03:39] something going bust so great question
[03:44] and the industry
[03:46] is the industry needs to be reset right
[03:50] from a perspective of who is where is
[03:53] the workforce coming from warranty
[03:55] repairs are okay but I'll leave it with
[04:01] you get what you pay for which is it's
[04:03] free right the an a free service you're
[04:06] going to get everything that a free
[04:08] service is going to get you whereas
[04:10] people in operations and operators that
[04:13] want to do this and have more reliable
[04:16] uptime themselves or they want to they
[04:18] want to minimize the the damage to their
[04:21] own machines or they want to make sure
[04:22] that they control and and and protect
[04:25] that investment in each minor each Asic
[04:28] whether it's latest gen or or last gen
[04:31] they they have more control over the
[04:33] lifespan of that unit if they can do
[04:35] this themselves and not have to send
[04:37] things out to a third party interesting
[04:40] by the way what uh you said you you
[04:42] trans transitioned to bitcoin what did
[04:44] you do before like did you repair some
[04:46] some other electronics before no no
[04:49] crazy story I'm actually a I'm actually
[04:50] a US Merchant sailor uh I retired I did
[04:53] a 12-year career at C uh on oil tankers
[04:57] and um yeah I
[05:00] I I retired with a master's license a
[05:02] captain's license unlimited tonnage and
[05:04] then moved into Bitcoin full-time I
[05:07] wanted to make I wanted to make Bitcoin
[05:09] a full-time career at some capacity and
[05:13] and uh but yeah I went to the Merchant
[05:14] Marine Academy uh I was a US Navy
[05:17] Reserve officer I had you know went to
[05:20] seea as an officer got all you know
[05:22] promoted all the way up to the to the
[05:23] highest level so uh and then basically
[05:26] started my career over again interesting
[05:29] how did um it's it's really interesting
[05:31] for me Bitcoin miners because it seems
[05:33] like sometimes they have like different
[05:35] FS you're also mining Bitcoin uh
[05:37] yourself I guess we mined Bitcoin for a
[05:40] long time until we wanted to focus
[05:43] completely on the repair facility and
[05:45] then optimizing the repair facility so I
[05:47] couldn't really do
[05:49] both uh as effectively as I needed to I
[05:52] needed to pick one and we wanted to go
[05:53] all in on repair on helping people and
[05:57] developing the skill sets
[05:59] I really good I'm asking this because I
[06:01] think like Bitcoin people that are into
[06:04] Bitcoin mining have something a
[06:06] different view on what Bitcoin is than
[06:10] people that are just in the Bitcoin for
[06:12] store value and and all the stuff like
[06:14] you're probably also in that for Bitcoin
[06:16] but they're only looking for like I have
[06:18] my Bitcoin in my wallet I'm using that
[06:20] and minus is just something that works
[06:23] it's Bitcoin mining in itself I feel
[06:25] like is an under reported topic Within
[06:29] Bitcoin it doesn't get uh as much
[06:32] attention as as I think it it needs how
[06:35] do you look differently on bitcoin what
[06:38] it is why it is important with the lens
[06:41] of like Bitcoin
[06:42] mining so I look at Bitcoin mining as a
[06:47] as an amazing new monetary tool set
[06:51] specifically for utilizing untapped
[06:54] energy or also helping to develop more
[06:58] energy resources across the globe so I
[07:00] see it I see it more as a monetization
[07:03] asset to to help create and spur more
[07:05] economic growth globally and and when
[07:09] when you do that you take on a lot of
[07:11] Financial Risk from the from the
[07:14] investors's perspective because you got
[07:16] to have you know millions of dollars in
[07:19] a lot of cases millions of dollars of
[07:21] capex to go into infrastructure to put
[07:23] hard Cable in the ground you're putting
[07:26] copper in the ground you're putting
[07:27] Transformers on the ground you're
[07:28] putting you're putting data centers on
[07:30] the ground it's a big Financial
[07:33] investment and I want to make sure that
[07:36] the people that are making those
[07:37] Investments have the best resources and
[07:41] tool sets and and education platforms
[07:43] available to make sure that they are
[07:45] successful in what they do interesting
[07:48] do you think that Bitcoin mining is
[07:49] decentralized enough I think that's a
[07:51] topic we talked a lot about on the
[07:53] podcast like a few months ago when we
[07:55] had a lot of Bitcoin miners on where
[07:57] like it it seems to be very concentrated
[07:59] on like big mining facilities and then
[08:02] especially the hardware providers that
[08:04] that are not that many and if you look
[08:06] down it's like only a few companies
[08:08] really providing those those
[08:10] stuff so decentralized I think from the
[08:15] if you're looking from the perspective
[08:17] geographically are they decentralized I
[08:19] think the the the geographical map
[08:21] speaks for itself where you've got
[08:23] operations big operations in powerway
[08:26] you got some in the Middle East we're
[08:28] starting up some some fairly sizable
[08:30] operations in Africa China is obviously
[08:34] there Russia's there US and Canada is
[08:37] there um so from a from a geographical
[08:40] standpoint I think that there is a lot
[08:42] of mix uh diverse mix of who is mining
[08:46] um On The Ground by country the investor
[08:51] set I'm not so sure I'll say that so I
[08:55] think that there's probably the the
[08:57] higher up you go in the investor set I
[08:59] think there are some big money Players
[09:01] but they tend to kind of I think be in
[09:05] the same pool money pool so like the the
[09:09] the people that are actually investing
[09:11] and controlling those bigger companies
[09:14] across it's also mining pool seems to be
[09:17] uh maybe a concern for the future like
[09:20] the the top three have like almost all
[09:22] all the hash or like top four something
[09:25] like that it is is that a concern at all
[09:27] for you I mean for me yeah that's been a
[09:29] concern of mine from the early days of a
[09:32] centralization of power I mean if you
[09:35] ask a typical minor if they understand
[09:38] if they have a voting right you know I
[09:40] vote with my hash well yeah you vote
[09:42] with your hash power but your hash power
[09:44] like I I don't last I checked I don't
[09:47] see any you know ballots going out to
[09:49] the hash you know to the to the to the
[09:51] miners asking them for their opinion on
[09:53] a particular uh VIP you know it's it's
[09:56] typically wherever the pool goes this is
[09:59] what's going to happen and if you know
[10:02] the pool operators we all know that you
[10:04] know it's a small industry they all know
[10:07] each other they all have their cell
[10:08] phones right they call each other up
[10:11] like hey what do you think of this what
[10:12] are we doing you know so it's kind of I
[10:15] do think that there is some some
[10:19] inherent risk with the centralization of
[10:21] mining pools but it's up to it's up to
[10:24] the miners to make sure that they are
[10:25] staying up to date on protocol changes
[10:29] or proposals and make sure that they
[10:31] understand what their what their mining
[10:33] pool is is allocating their hash towards
[10:36] so there's there's some responsibility I
[10:39] mean there needs to be a lot of
[10:40] self-governance and responsibility from
[10:42] minor perspective that we need to make
[10:44] sure that we are keeping those that are
[10:46] uh operating on our behalf in check just
[10:49] like just like here in the United States
[10:50] we have to make sure our representation
[10:52] in Congress are
[10:55] actively executing the will of the
[10:57] people you know and if you're if you
[10:59] don't feel like that was the case then
[11:01] you need to say something right and
[11:03] nothing is more like that was never more
[11:06] obvious than this last election cycle
[11:08] with with Donald Trump where the
[11:10] majority of the country felt like no we
[11:13] don't like the direction this country's
[11:14] headed in we need a change and we need
[11:17] we need Donald Trump so um he I know
[11:20] he's got various opinions across the
[11:23] world whether people love them or hate
[11:24] him but uh the results of the election
[11:27] cycle were pretty conclusive and I feel
[11:30] like as a miner you need to make sure
[11:33] that we have that same mentality to make
[11:35] sure that mining pools are kept in
[11:37] check interesting Ju Just quickly on
[11:40] Donald Trump you're you're in a you're
[11:42] in America right yes uh how did H how
[11:46] are you like how was that whole thing of
[11:49] the he is getting elected Bitcoin is
[11:51] shooting up to 100K and now he's getting
[11:54] into office uh how did you live through
[11:56] that uh from from your perspective so I
[12:00] mean I just like any other Bitcoin cycle
[12:02] right so I mean I've been in it for
[12:05] going on five years and so I I've kind
[12:07] of maybe a little bit more numb to the
[12:09] new cycles per se because you kind of
[12:11] see you you zoom out you see the macro
[12:13] cycles and such and and uh I think that
[12:18] he brings a lot of favorable atmosphere
[12:21] here in the US and kind of it spills
[12:24] over into Canada a lot of what the US
[12:27] does Canada usually will try to ad
[12:30] uh but generally speaking I think it was
[12:33] a good thing for for crypto I think
[12:35] we're probably going to get some clarity
[12:37] on regulation he's making a lot of
[12:39] really big moves very fast in this
[12:42] direction and we'll see you know he
[12:44] freed Ross BR you know he he he's done a
[12:47] lot of the things that he said he was
[12:49] going to do and we'll see how we'll see
[12:53] how the marketplace will accept all this
[12:56] information digest it and we'll see what
[12:58] happens next I mean 11 states have have
[13:02] Bitcoin strategic Reserve bills before
[13:05] their uh before their Congress so you
[13:08] know I think I think we're going to be
[13:10] in a in an
[13:11] interesting part of the Bitcoin history
[13:14] right now it's it's it's fascinating how
[13:16] quick this I just discussed that with
[13:18] the previous guest it's it's if you
[13:20] talked one year ago about uh the USA
[13:24] buying Bitcoin and states of the USA
[13:26] buying Bitcoin you're like oh like
[13:28] that's crazy that will not happen in
[13:30] 2095 now it's crazy to say they won't
[13:35] buy it there will be at least like one
[13:37] state or like at least like B like the
[13:39] USA that buys a little bit or like has
[13:41] some exposure that adoption cycle went
[13:44] really quickly like it's it's kind of
[13:46] fascinating to see that if you zoom out
[13:49] a little bit and yeah I'm also kind of
[13:52] almost five years into Bitcoin I came
[13:54] into 2020 and uh assuming out there to
[13:58] like uh back in 2020 H it's it's kind of
[14:01] amazing how far we already have gotten
[14:04] yeah absolutely I mean that five years
[14:07] ago this was not even a thought yeah
[14:10] it's it's five years ago like I was
[14:13] really shocked when I heard about El
[14:16] Salvador uh and now it's America it's
[14:20] it's kind of weird that we jumped so
[14:22] quick I thought like there will be a
[14:24] lower like uh maybe some African State
[14:28] maybe some more South American states
[14:30] like States who actually have a huge
[14:32] problem with the Fiat system it
[14:34] surprised me that the kind of the king
[14:37] of the fat system is is kind of
[14:40] approaching Bitcoin more openly than
[14:43] those who actually suffer more from the
[14:45] feeld system were you surprised by that
[14:48] too I was I was a little surp I I was
[14:51] surprised by that I I'll say that uh I
[14:53] think that time will tell whether or not
[14:55] he's going to purchase Bitcoin on on the
[14:59] balance sheet of the United States or if
[15:00] he's just going to basically nationalize
[15:04] whatever they've confiscated already I
[15:06] think there's a big difference between
[15:08] the two of them we'll see where he ends
[15:10] up going I think it's safe to say that
[15:12] he's going to just treasury whatever
[15:16] they already have from Caesars uh of
[15:20] illegal activity or what they deem to be
[15:22] illegal activity so I mean at the end of
[15:24] the day it's still it's still it's still
[15:26] seizure right they didn't buy it they
[15:29] They confiscated it and um we'll see
[15:33] we'll just see what kind of what plays
[15:34] out but I'm still kind of maybe I'm just
[15:38] a little bit more skeptical than most
[15:39] people but I'll I'll wait and see what
[15:41] he actually does and we'll follow that
[15:44] but I the the interesting thing is it's
[15:46] like does the marketplace so the
[15:48] question everybody always has is is is
[15:50] the market already pricing a strategic
[15:52] Reserve in uh is that already in the
[15:55] price did they already did they already
[15:57] buy is that price already reflective of
[15:58] that that new cycle and again it's just
[16:02] one of those things you're trying to
[16:03] predict predict the markets and it's
[16:05] it's a it's a it's a tough game to be in
[16:08] if you're trying to do that that's why I
[16:10] like I mean nothing and all everything
[16:14] is kind of always priced in like like
[16:17] obviously like the market price reflects
[16:20] what's currently on the on the news like
[16:22] if if we have we if we have strategic
[16:25] Bitcoin reserve and it's kind of already
[16:28] pressed in maybe it looks looks a little
[16:29] bit forward but I I I don't know like I
[16:31] I I don't like those questions of like
[16:33] is it price in like who how how would
[16:35] you know like exactly exactly how do you
[16:39] know you don't know you know you're just
[16:40] guessing and that's why I take the
[16:42] longer view approach of I I believe in
[16:45] putting actual megawatts in the ground
[16:49] data centers in the ground and be able
[16:52] to give the people a an asset that is is
[16:57] a real world asset I like I like to be
[16:59] back at the I like the physical world
[17:01] myself um I mean I I like the ideals of
[17:04] self- sovereignty I like the ideals of
[17:06] what Bitcoin uh at least represented to
[17:10] me back when I started jumping in and I
[17:14] I want to make sure that data integrity
[17:17] and data sovereignty are are real things
[17:19] in our in our world and but for me the
[17:23] big picture is infrastructure because
[17:26] the the the data centers aren't going
[17:28] away us just uh just had half a trillion
[17:31] dollars uh pumped into the economy for
[17:34] Grants there for data center development
[17:37] it's going to be interesting to see
[17:38] where that money lands is some of it
[17:40] going to go to bitcoin is you know a lot
[17:42] of it's going to go to probably the AI
[17:44] but what about you know is Bitcoin going
[17:46] to be considered part of that data
[17:48] center narrative because that's what we
[17:50] call ourselves uh when you're building
[17:52] something out so we'll see again we'll
[17:54] see where everything where the
[17:55] investment dollars actually start
[17:57] funneling but I I think Bitcoin is a
[18:00] great asset to build and monetize
[18:03] electrical infrastructure from day one
[18:05] right and that's hard to do with with
[18:08] massive build outs if you're going to
[18:10] build infrastructure that costs millions
[18:12] of dollars you want to make sure that
[18:14] there's a payback period for that
[18:17] investment and there's there's there's
[18:21] almost no better mechanism than Bitcoin
[18:23] mining because it it's so load heavy you
[18:25] can monetize all that energy that you
[18:27] create from day one
[18:29] as soon as that load is ready you could
[18:31] start pulling power right that is a
[18:33] great economic incentive for both power
[18:36] producers whether it be power plants or
[18:39] whether it be uh natural gas or whether
[18:42] it be flare gas and uh and then also the
[18:45] data center developers people that are
[18:47] looking to build out infrastructure
[18:49] either in Bitcoin or AI this is a great
[18:52] mechanism for for getting things started
[18:55] interest do you think that how do I
[18:58] approach it do you think that Bitcoin
[18:59] hash rate is more important uh than
[19:02] anything else any other metric uh in in
[19:05] Bitcoin is that the the number one
[19:06] you're looking at like how strong the
[19:08] the network is so I think I think that
[19:12] hash rate
[19:13] is it's an indication of where people
[19:17] think that the future of Bitcoin is
[19:19] going right if you see the hash rate
[19:21] start to fall off that means that people
[19:24] are finding other mechanisms to put
[19:26] their investment dollars into from from
[19:28] a from from an infrastructure
[19:31] perspective right so we are seeing still
[19:34] rapid growth in development of data
[19:37] centers of Bitcoin mining right and
[19:40] that's positive for Bitcoin because that
[19:43] means that bitcoiners are are being able
[19:46] to attract investors being able to build
[19:48] continue to build infrastructure and
[19:50] they have a positive future outlook on
[19:53] on the landscape of Bitcoin mining so I
[19:55] think it is a very important future
[19:58] projection of where
[20:00] miners uh how strong Min miners believe
[20:04] in Bitcoin mining itself as a revenue
[20:06] generating
[20:07] asset interesting it's it's almost
[20:11] interesting for me the the thing of hash
[20:14] rate versus price uh and if you think
[20:18] about logically it it kind of should be
[20:20] correlated but it isn't at all it is is
[20:24] some some correlation there but it kind
[20:26] of got decoupled uh the last bare Market
[20:30] where we had major alltime HDs in the
[20:32] hash rate when the price was kind of at
[20:35] like a 50% low um how do you see the the
[20:40] relationship between hash rate and and
[20:42] the Bitcoin price itself so the smartest
[20:46] people always jump on an investment when
[20:49] it doesn't look the best right as soon
[20:52] as something becomes an opportunity it's
[20:55] the opportunity is usually not there and
[20:57] bit so Bitcoin miners are are kind of
[20:59] it's kind of like the housing cycle
[21:01] right you got to you build housing and
[21:03] then all of a sudden at the peak of the
[21:04] housing market or housing cycle that
[21:07] there's all kinds of construction going
[21:09] on and then typically a lot of the the
[21:11] construction stops or they go bankrupt
[21:13] because they lose funding because the
[21:15] bubble pops and it goes back down where
[21:18] who made the most money the people that
[21:20] built during the low cycle and ramped up
[21:23] production enough into the high cycle I
[21:27] think Bitcoin min miners are no
[21:29] different where the the miners that are
[21:31] able to profit the most are able to
[21:34] build and raise capital and build and
[21:36] deploy megawatts during the hardest
[21:39] times of Mining and that means also
[21:41] finding the best cost of energy right
[21:43] that means finding the energy sources
[21:45] that are giving them an opportunity to
[21:47] still make a at least a tiny profit to
[21:50] be able to justify the expense so that
[21:52] they can then make a lot of profit when
[21:56] hash price recovers right
[21:59] and we'll
[22:01] see we'll see when when miners really
[22:04] start making a lot of money or a lot of
[22:06] return on their investment uh and again
[22:08] that's all in dollar terms it's all in I
[22:10] mean we're not even talking about like
[22:12] holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset on a
[22:14] balance sheet of a company like we're
[22:16] talking purely just US dollar return
[22:19] Capital deployed versus Capital back
[22:21] what's your Roi um but it's usually the
[22:24] miners that have the the conviction and
[22:27] the the basically the the stones to be
[22:29] able to build when things are tough so
[22:31] that they can enjoy the fruits of their
[22:33] work when things are good interesting uh
[22:37] the the space is so uh so interesting
[22:40] for me um when when I look at all of
[22:43] that and the information uh for for
[22:45] Bitcoin mining it seems like it's a it's
[22:47] a game for big companies that can um
[22:50] kind of move like they can move into the
[22:53] bare markets uh when the times are the
[22:56] hardest and then can get the fruits of
[22:59] their labor when then the times are good
[23:01] but you have to have like this worker
[23:03] Capital before already is is that do we
[23:07] need more home miners small operations
[23:09] solo miners is is is that something that
[23:12] you're like oh like we we're moving to
[23:14] too much to institutionalized miners I
[23:17] think moving into large scale mining
[23:20] operations is from one aspect it's kind
[23:24] of inevitable I think because power and
[23:28] money typically will consolidate
[23:30] especially during bare Market Cycles
[23:33] consolidation of hash rate smaller
[23:35] miners or medium miners selling to the
[23:37] bigger miners that have the pocketbook
[23:39] to cash out um or are having financial
[23:42] distress you'll see a lot of mergers and
[23:44] Acquisitions during downturn cycles and
[23:48] that's in any industry so it's I think
[23:51] that it's over a long enough time
[23:55] Horizon it it happens natur naturally in
[23:59] in nature but I think
[24:03] that you know the rise of solo Mining
[24:06] and home
[24:07] mining there's I look at those as more
[24:11] lottery tickets than I do actually
[24:14] infrastructure right that's not I mean
[24:16] people want to participate as a home
[24:18] Miner as a solo Miner like there's
[24:20] nothing nothing against it but you're
[24:22] buying a lottery ticket and that's fine
[24:25] if as long as you understand that you're
[24:26] just buying a lottery ticket and it's
[24:28] just to to kind of dip your toe in the
[24:30] water as a as a uh as a retail person or
[24:34] as somebody that is you know Works a
[24:36] regular job has other income it's not
[24:38] really worried about it but they want to
[24:39] be part of something bigger it's a great
[24:42] Avenue for that um heat reuse we're
[24:44] seeing a lot of heat reuse capture
[24:46] projects people M you know mining and
[24:49] heating their houses during the winter
[24:50] time uh green houses heat recovery you
[24:54] know there's some really interesting
[24:57] mini projects going going on with the
[24:59] hardware that are I think you know good
[25:03] developments there but from a from a
[25:06] from a capital deployment standpoint you
[25:09] got to see you know bigger investors are
[25:12] not looking at at that as being a real a
[25:15] real thing right that's not the comp
[25:17] competition that the big miners have
[25:19] they're using it's an arms race of of
[25:23] hash rate you know how do you deploy as
[25:25] much hash rate as you can at the lowest
[25:27] possible cost with the lowest possible
[25:29] energy to get the most amount of return
[25:31] on on that money and and that's a much
[25:35] different game like that's that that's
[25:37] actually looking at mining as a business
[25:40] versus as a hobby or as a lottery ticket
[25:43] you know the mentality is totally
[25:45] separate is how do you look at um using
[25:50] Bitcoin mining as an way to
[25:53] accumulate uh Bitcoin more efficiently
[25:58] as as someone that has like a minimum of
[26:02] amount of capital I guess if you have
[26:04] like a very small amount of capital it's
[26:06] not even a question of if you have if
[26:08] you have like a like a few thousand EUR
[26:11] it's probably not even worth thinking
[26:13] about it but if you have like 50,000
[26:15] 100,000 maybe like half a million or
[26:16] something like that is is is something
[26:20] uh is it worth looking at accumulating
[26:22] Bitcoin through Bitcoin mining I think
[26:25] that over a long enough of time Arizon
[26:29] people that mine Bitcoin have an un will
[26:32] have an unfair advantage over people
[26:34] that just buy
[26:36] Bitcoin but you got to be willing to
[26:39] learn right and you got to be willing to
[26:42] accumulate a lot of skills construction
[26:44] you got to have basic electrical
[26:46] knowledge you got to know your
[26:47] infrastructure you got to know you know
[26:49] you got to know what you're kind of
[26:50] doing and but if you look at like the
[26:52] big companies big publicly traded
[26:55] companies here in the US a lot of them
[26:56] operate a loss you know they're op
[26:58] they're not really operating at a profit
[27:01] the difference is that they can raise
[27:02] capital in the in the public markets
[27:04] really cheap right we just looked at
[27:06] Marathon Riot HUD a you know these guys
[27:09] all just issued zero
[27:12] 0% uh convertible notes essentially
[27:15] following the micro strategy plan you
[27:17] know Playbook of I'm going to raise you
[27:19] know a couple billion dollars from the
[27:22] capital markets and all I'm going to do
[27:23] is go buy Bitcoin right like you could
[27:26] see that that
[27:30] there's those miners have the ability to
[27:32] raise Capital like no other and it's an
[27:35] unfair advantage to them however the
[27:38] unfair advantage to the private miners
[27:41] or maybe even the smaller miners is that
[27:43] at at a reasonable enough scale you have
[27:47] the ability to actually operate much
[27:49] more efficiently than even the bigger
[27:51] players and that makes you dangerous
[27:53] because if you can operate at a much
[27:55] lower uh all-in cost and your cost to
[27:59] produce a Bitcoin uh on per Bitcoin
[28:02] basis is much lower than even bigger
[28:04] players that means that you can keep
[28:06] mining much longer than anybody else so
[28:09] that's where the game that's where the
[28:11] game gets really interesting is and and
[28:13] there's a lot of smaller miners you know
[28:16] C you know couple megawatts maybe up to
[28:18] 10 megawatts but these guys are
[28:20] operating at a really high efficiency
[28:22] because their their their operating
[28:24] costs are much lower than even people
[28:27] with much larger infrastructure so you
[28:30] got to look at where everything's going
[28:32] you know plus you could play you play
[28:34] tax strategy I know here in the US we
[28:36] you can play a tax strategy of uh depre
[28:39] you know quick depreciation schedule of
[28:41] all your assets so you can take full
[28:43] depreciation so you lower your tax
[28:45] burdens and so money saved is money
[28:48] earned so there's a lot of different
[28:49] things to consider when you're getting
[28:51] into the business side of Mining and
[28:53] Mining economics and it's it's not it's
[28:56] a hard question to answer but in general
[28:58] yes if you only got a couple thousand um
[29:01] buy Bitcoin and be you know be happy
[29:04] right buy it and be done with it like
[29:06] don't don't try to get into this uh as a
[29:09] as a business but if you're if you've
[29:12] got a good amount of capital in the bank
[29:14] and you're you're looking to deploy it
[29:17] you know it may be worth considering I
[29:19] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[29:23] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[29:26] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[29:28] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[29:31] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[29:34] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[29:38] go out there and show that you are a
[29:40] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[29:43] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[29:46] dropped a completely new and amazing
[29:48] Genesis edition of their watch
[29:51] collections you have the date of the
[29:53] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[29:57] and of course also the block height and
[29:59] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[30:03] level of detail they put in in this
[30:05] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:08] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:11] down in the descriptions I love those
[30:13] watches so so much if you watch or
[30:17] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[30:19] I'll guess you already bought some
[30:21] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[30:24] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[30:27] in a Hardware wallet my personal
[30:29] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:31] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[30:34] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[30:36] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[30:39] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[30:42] with the code Robin at the checkout
[30:44] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[30:48] your bitbox and the next step is to
[30:51] really level up your sovereignty as an
[30:53] individual you have to have the most
[30:56] secure self- custody setup you have to
[30:58] secure your own devices you have to
[31:01] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:04] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:06] where you live you even want to have a
[31:09] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:12] in case something goes really really
[31:13] wrong and through all those steps the
[31:15] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[31:18] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[31:21] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[31:25] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[31:28] how you can level up your sovereignty
[31:30] how do you look at uh Bitcoin mining uh
[31:33] how does it Bitcoin mining is a service
[31:36] uh I forgot how how those guys uh are
[31:38] named they doing basically you buy a
[31:41] Bitcoin M and there and they operate for
[31:44] you oh gosh I had him I had him on my
[31:46] podcast I forgot how they called hosting
[31:49] hosting hosting agreements yeah like
[31:52] hosting is a like basically they are
[31:53] hosting you you buy a machine and they
[31:55] are hosting it for you or something like
[31:57] that where you don't have to have the
[31:59] capabilities of you but you're like hey
[32:01] I'm buying 10 machines there one I uh
[32:06] accumulate Bitcoin in a different way in
[32:08] B I have like um I contribute to the to
[32:12] the network if someone wants to do that
[32:14] uh where the entry cost of that I think
[32:18] what I saw is like 7,000 with like the
[32:20] first machines they're offering uh so
[32:22] like it's it's affordable to probably
[32:25] most of the people listening to here I
[32:26] think you just have to be careful
[32:27] careful I think there's there are a lot
[32:29] of good honest people out there doing a
[32:32] good job at hosting but there's a lot of
[32:34] really bad people doing a lot of bad
[32:36] hosting and and it's it's one of those
[32:39] things that you you kind of in my
[32:42] opinion you should know who you're
[32:44] getting into bed with right you should
[32:46] at least couple things if you're going
[32:48] to do that route you're going to go that
[32:50] route it would be probably preferable if
[32:53] you saw the facility right if you were
[32:55] able to see the facility you know if you
[32:58] could see how they're operating if you
[33:00] got maybe if you get an understanding of
[33:02] what they're doing to your machine what
[33:04] are their reg routine procedures what
[33:07] are their training requirements for
[33:08] their staff what are they doing uh to to
[33:11] make sure that you have uptime or they
[33:13] just throwing it onto a shelf in the
[33:15] middle of a field and there's nobody
[33:17] around right and then there's no way to
[33:19] and you're on your own for repairs
[33:20] you're on your own when it goes down you
[33:22] don't there's inconsistencies and in
[33:25] Communications get you know so it's just
[33:27] there's you can get into trouble real
[33:29] quick you could put real dollars at risk
[33:32] uh and or real money at risk by getting
[33:35] into by by trusting somebody else but I
[33:39] will say that there it just depends on
[33:41] the agreement you know make sure that
[33:43] it's it's a there's there's a give and
[33:45] take right make sure there's enough
[33:47] enough uh Capital coming in so that it
[33:51] justifies the expense that you can make
[33:54] your money right because that when
[33:55] you're when you're looking at it again
[33:57] when you're looking at from a business
[33:58] you want to make sure that you know when
[34:00] when is your payback period if I give
[34:02] somebody
[34:03] $5,000 how quickly am I going to see
[34:06] $5,000 back and then how much and then
[34:09] how quickly am I going to see a return
[34:10] on that money that's how I would really
[34:12] look at any kind of business investment
[34:15] because that's really what you're doing
[34:16] you're investing in somebody else's
[34:18] business and um I will say this too that
[34:22] a common strategy you see is uh hosting
[34:26] providers will
[34:28] take on clients and customers as a way
[34:31] of financing their own operation and
[34:34] then as soon as they have basically all
[34:37] the infrastructures paid for you know
[34:39] they cut loose their customers right and
[34:41] then they buy their own machines and
[34:42] they put their own machines in there you
[34:44] see that plenty of times so again it's
[34:47] just one of those things you just got to
[34:48] know who you're who you're who you're
[34:50] who you're working with and and if you
[34:52] don't like who they are as a person and
[34:54] they're not honest about who they are
[34:56] and what they're trying to achieve
[34:58] then I would say that it's probably not
[35:00] a good fit but but I think there are a
[35:02] lot of really good hosters out there you
[35:04] just got to be really
[35:06] careful interesting I just wanna because
[35:09] I while while you're talking I got it
[35:12] now just want to throw it in there uh as
[35:15] as an as um additional information there
[35:18] I talked about SAS Mining and abandoned
[35:20] mines both of their uh CEOs were already
[35:23] on on the podcast uh was was interesting
[35:27] to talk about about their strategy of
[35:29] like accumulating Bitcoin in a different
[35:31] way because I never looked at Bitcoin
[35:33] mining as a way to actually accumulate
[35:35] Bitcoin if you have like let's say you
[35:37] have a $50,000 uh dollars and you want
[35:39] to accumulate Bitcoin you go you can
[35:42] just buy it uh which is probably best
[35:44] for most people but it there's also the
[35:46] other way of like um accumulating
[35:50] through Bitcoin mining and then it's the
[35:53] most interesting thing for me currently
[35:55] is actually like heat reuse and using
[35:59] Bitcoin miners uh in a way that you
[36:02] would have anyways paid for the
[36:05] electricity but you're getting Bitcoin
[36:07] for that there are some apartment uh
[36:09] buildings that are now uh using the
[36:12] Bitcoin miners which lowers the cost of
[36:14] electricity for each and every one each
[36:17] each apartment uh super uh interesting
[36:20] things going on there with bitco and I
[36:22] think if you get an edge in like a small
[36:25] case like that as you said you have
[36:27] advantage over the the big guys because
[36:29] you can have like a small case which is
[36:31] actually more efficient and more
[36:33] profitable for you personally uh than uh
[36:37] like a a huge Mining facility which is
[36:40] an really interesting aspect of of of
[36:42] Bitcoin I like that a
[36:44] lot yeah same here I really like that a
[36:47] lot especially when you the creativeness
[36:49] of bitcoiners of turning expense items
[36:52] like heating right house heating or
[36:54] Plumbing or or what have you they turn
[36:56] an expens and make it a make it a cash
[36:59] flowing asset or making turning it into
[37:00] a profit generating machine that's those
[37:03] are the kind of innovations that are are
[37:06] super cool and to and and it's really
[37:09] from a conservationist perspective it's
[37:11] yeah we're using the resources of our
[37:13] energy as best as possible because we
[37:16] are not only taking energy and just
[37:19] burning it for heat we are creating it
[37:21] making heat and making a profit
[37:24] generating machine so we're adding more
[37:26] value into into the general economy so I
[37:29] I love that interesting yeah really cool
[37:32] um how do you look at the the nation
[37:35] state game theory not for Bitcoin itself
[37:39] but for accumulating as much Bitcoin
[37:41] Miners and hash rate we have the popular
[37:43] saying when we come back to Donald Trump
[37:45] like we will mine all the Bitcoin in
[37:47] America obviously that will not happen
[37:49] uh but how how do you look at the
[37:51] importance of that nation state game
[37:54] theory of securing as much hash rate
[37:57] Within a nation spor uh maybe even
[38:00] versus maybe it's even more important
[38:03] than uh accumulating Bitcoin on the B
[38:05] sheet that's a great question I have
[38:07] mixed feelings about it
[38:10] because on one hand it's you want to
[38:14] secure the network the one thing that
[38:16] the Bitcoin network doesn't have is uh
[38:20] is physical defense right like nation
[38:24] states are powerful because they have
[38:26] guns right they have the ability to to
[38:29] defend its citizenry against threats
[38:32] right that's that's a that's probably
[38:34] the biggest difference between a nation
[38:36] state versus citizens right most
[38:40] citizens don't have the ability to to to
[38:42] defend themselves against a large threat
[38:44] that's why we have a country that
[38:46] protects us so so from that aspect it's
[38:53] it's I could see its positives but it's
[38:56] a very I think it's a very scary thought
[39:00] to think that basically Bitcoin mining
[39:03] is going to end up being nationalized on
[39:05] a global scale uh I mean talk about a
[39:08] centralization of power because the
[39:10] these Global elitists are all in the
[39:12] same in the same boardroom together and
[39:15] doesn't matter us Russia China you know
[39:18] Europe European Union uh Brazil they're
[39:21] all going to the same same conferences
[39:23] they're all rubbing elbows with each
[39:25] other it's it's a very small room all
[39:29] the way at the top and that that makes
[39:32] that gives whenever you have that that
[39:34] much power Consolidated amongst a very
[39:37] small amount of people it leaves for
[39:40] abuse it like it's going like how do you
[39:43] not have abuse when you have that much
[39:44] control right and that's what gives me
[39:47] extreme pause uh to be excited about it
[39:51] I I I typically believe that in the
[39:53] spirit of decentralization the whole
[39:55] point of that narrative is that self-
[39:57] sovereignty right we are supposed to be
[40:00] our the the we are supposed to be able
[40:02] to govern ourselves and be in charge of
[40:04] our own data and have our own privacy
[40:07] and be able to control our own resources
[40:09] as individuals and uh nation states
[40:13] doing the game theory of mining I I
[40:16] don't see that how that ends well for
[40:19] for individual sovereignty I I just
[40:21] knowing knowing the temptation of how
[40:24] much power and abuse that's going to be
[40:26] if all of our uh hash power is
[40:30] Consolidated like that it just I think
[40:33] there's too many too many things that
[40:35] going to go wrong with that with that
[40:36] with that model so I'm not I'm not
[40:40] excited about it per se
[40:43] overall I I I mean um I I hope Trump is
[40:47] not talking about nationalizing Bitcoin
[40:50] farms and and putting under the US
[40:53] government I I I really do hope because
[40:55] I see it like you like there like no
[40:57] value in that and it's would be really
[40:59] bad um but there's a a value in the
[41:03] country of like making the country
[41:06] Bitcoin mining friendly making the
[41:09] framework as good as possible for
[41:11] Bitcoin mining uh to to bring as much uh
[41:15] Bitcoin mining companies to America but
[41:18] yeah it's a dangerous route to go down
[41:21] if like if you have a few really big
[41:23] mining facilities they can be
[41:26] nationalized even if they private now uh
[41:29] so I I do hope that um uh they they
[41:33] still I I I probably need like small
[41:36] mining facilities and and like how how
[41:39] they call like rabbits how Bob pet calls
[41:41] them like the really small ones and the
[41:43] rabbits and the horses the small rabbit
[41:46] that that is kind of hard to to shoot at
[41:49] uh to make it really hard in the future
[41:52] to prevent that that uh president is
[41:54] going here like we we have all that
[41:55] miners like that this critical
[41:58] infrastructure we now have to get it
[42:00] under our control because it's otherwise
[42:03] too dangerous for the citizens or some
[42:06] some BS like that I I could imagine that
[42:10] at some point a president could say that
[42:11] long it's critical infrastructure we
[42:13] need to nationalize it and uh we we need
[42:16] to like we we have to be prepared for
[42:18] for that and and that's why I also see a
[42:21] big value in those smaller rabbits if
[42:24] you will so yeah absolutely I think that
[42:27] I mean it it's not a far stretch of the
[42:29] imagination to take this to to another
[42:32] to another extreme is you know power
[42:35] companies or power providers power
[42:39] generators they if they become dependent
[42:41] upon the load then if it goes away now
[42:44] they have all these resources that are
[42:46] not being used right so it it's those
[42:51] are the situations that it's like okay I
[42:53] see it as a good thing for Private
[42:54] Industry right now to get investment and
[42:57] to make investment into IND to make
[42:59] investment into electrical
[43:00] infrastructure and let's create an
[43:02] economic cycle of of really good
[43:05] prosperity across the world because the
[43:07] more we Electrify the world the better
[43:10] the standards of living for everybody
[43:11] because you need electricity to be able
[43:13] to have a functioning uh like a really
[43:17] vibrant economy you look at the best
[43:18] economies in the world they're all the
[43:20] ones that have the most power like
[43:21] they're all the ones that are turned on
[43:23] electrically the lights are on
[43:24] everything's working they have access to
[43:26] the internet access to utilities and
[43:29] they're able to connect to people
[43:31] globally and provide goods and services
[43:33] and keep things moving right and without
[43:36] that it's it's very hard so with with
[43:39] growth of electrical of electricity we
[43:41] could see a major Global growth of uh of
[43:45] economic cycle right and that's what
[43:47] that's what we want to that's what I
[43:48] would hope as a people that live on this
[43:51] Earth we want to see everybody do well
[43:53] together and I think Bitcoin has a
[43:56] Bitcoin mining has has a great strategic
[43:58] advantage to help Foster that
[44:01] growth absolutely um one question before
[44:04] we come to our endro tetin questions
[44:06] what do you think will Bitcoin change in
[44:09] in in our society in society uh in what
[44:14] in what ways do you or you mean Society
[44:16] uh just like how we live together how we
[44:19] live together I mean honestly Bitcoin I
[44:22] don't see Bitcoin as a way that it's
[44:24] going to change the way we live together
[44:27] honestly because I mean human
[44:28] interaction is I think is something
[44:31] that's Universal and it's Timeless right
[44:34] humans have been working in living
[44:35] together for you know thousands of years
[44:38] and you know the way we interact with
[44:41] each other I I don't see that level
[44:44] changing the way the Monet the monetary
[44:47] system and the way we conduct business
[44:49] may be different like with the with the
[44:52] uh introduction of the internet right it
[44:55] changed the way commerce was done so the
[44:57] tools that we use to interact with each
[44:59] other may change and Bitcoin May is the
[45:01] next iteration of that change but the
[45:05] way we interact as people I think it's
[45:07] still people you know still being a good
[45:09] person and and and being there for one
[45:11] another and the the the ideals of
[45:15] Brotherhood of supporting each other of
[45:19] interacting with each other at an
[45:21] economic level like all these things are
[45:22] basic basic to human behavior and I I I
[45:27] I hope that it what I what I do hope
[45:30] that Bitcoin does is it gets everybody
[45:31] to think about being self- Sovereign how
[45:34] do we again how do we take back control
[45:36] of our own data to be Sovereign over
[45:39] ourselves and how do we how do we make
[45:42] sure we protect ourselves in a world
[45:44] where privacy is scarce right how do we
[45:46] become how do we have the ability to to
[45:49] safeguard ourselves in a way that we are
[45:52] in control of our of of who gets access
[45:55] to our to our data so that's what I
[45:59] really want to see change with Bitcoin
[46:01] is that people really start
[46:03] investigating and looking about looking
[46:06] looking into themselves and okay is
[46:09] there a way that I can be more
[46:11] controlling over who I am as a person
[46:14] that's what I would love to see
[46:16] interesting yeah um I definitely agree
[46:21] with like I think it it incentivizes a
[46:23] lot of things and I hope uh I hope
[46:26] Bitcoin uh is it's it's that tool that
[46:29] doesn't change everything but it kind of
[46:32] gives a better framework to to things uh
[46:35] and and yeah really cool um we have one
[46:37] question that I asked e one of my guests
[46:39] and the question is what can we learn
[46:41] from you besides Bitcoin what can you
[46:43] learn for me besides Bitcoin
[46:45] um what would you like to
[46:48] know I I think that
[46:51] um I I'm a big advocate of family and
[46:57] like I have a big family I have five
[46:58] kids and being able
[47:02] to to be anticult today in America
[47:06] almost means that you have to have you
[47:10] love your wife you're your faithful to
[47:13] your wife you have a big family you eat
[47:15] healthy and and you're you're a good
[47:18] citizen like basically you doing some of
[47:20] the very Basics foundations of what
[47:22] makes a society function is almost
[47:25] countercultural or seemed to be
[47:28] countercultural in the United States up
[47:30] to a few weeks ago when Trump took
[47:32] office so I would say I'm a big advocate
[47:36] of uh Faith like being I'm an avid
[47:39] Christian I'm a big I'm a big believer
[47:42] in in Jesus Christ I believe in having a
[47:45] family I believe in instilling good
[47:47] values into your children making sure
[47:49] that we conserve our resources
[47:52] appropriately so that we have a future
[47:54] to pass on to those children and
[47:56] great-grandchildren and into the future
[47:58] that we provide a place that is safe and
[48:01] secure for many generations to come to
[48:04] live like those are the things that I'm
[48:05] about and I I you know I really want to
[48:08] make that a reality in our world
[48:11] absolutely really cool I love that um we
[48:13] have a endotine in the podcast where the
[48:15] previous guest is asking a question for
[48:17] the next guest without knowing who the
[48:19] next guest actually is and the previous
[48:21] guest asked you what does it mean to be
[48:24] a whole coiner to you and what do you
[48:26] think it will mean in 10 years from now
[48:28] whole
[48:29] corner I think I think that from a I I
[48:34] think that that term whole corer
[48:39] is uh I I think that it
[48:43] is almost unnecessary honestly because
[48:47] it's again it's a it's a I I don't
[48:51] particularly like that concept because
[48:54] it's one of hoarding and and and taking
[48:57] from society again I'm I'm about making
[48:59] sure that everybody has the opportunity
[49:01] to succeed and I think that people that
[49:05] hold everything too close to themselves
[49:08] without the ability to to to look around
[49:10] and see how they can help others I think
[49:13] that that's that's a little shortsighted
[49:15] right I'd like to see us be able to to
[49:18] have and to live in a in a world in
[49:20] which it's not necessarily all about
[49:24] what I can get for myself absolutely I
[49:26] that that's really cool I I mean it's
[49:29] it's it's the we have so much unit bias
[49:31] in our thinking and it's completely
[49:34] unnecessary because what if it wouldn't
[49:37] be 21 million but like 42 million like
[49:41] uh like if if satosi just said that
[49:43] number instead of 21 uh like then we
[49:47] would would we still celebrate one
[49:49] Bitcoin probably because not that
[49:52] doesn't make that much of a difference
[49:53] but it's it's unit bias but people
[49:56] people work like that they want to have
[49:58] whole round numbers and I definitely
[50:01] always uh get more motivated before
[50:04] hitting uh a new round number in in any
[50:07] way shape or form like doesn't even have
[50:09] to be money uh even like I'm I'm I'm
[50:11] swimming a lot and uh and if if I can do
[50:15] something for like seven times I'm
[50:17] trying to hit like can I do that for
[50:20] like 10 times like hitting like 100
[50:23] meters of swim in a certain amount of
[50:25] time uh if I I can do it for seven times
[50:28] in a row I I want to hit this 10 like we
[50:31] always have in all of our lives this
[50:33] this unit Buys in us that's why 100K was
[50:35] also a huge huge thing inside of the
[50:37] Bitcoin Community but outside nobody
[50:40] really cared it seems like yeah yeah I
[50:44] agree with you absolutely yeah really
[50:47] cool thank you so much Alex for for
