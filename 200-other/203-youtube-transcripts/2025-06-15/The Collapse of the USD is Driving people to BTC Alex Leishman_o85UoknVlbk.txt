[00:00] people's Baseline is is dollars and
[00:02] they've seen their prices go up crazy
[00:04] amounts in dollar terms it makes them
[00:06] question things and it creates a lack of
[00:08] trust in US institutions and people look
[00:10] for something different and I think this
[00:11] high level macro theme is why more and
[00:13] more people in businesses are are saving
[00:15] in
[00:16] Bitcoin I I recently saw a speech of you
[00:19] I think like three four weeks ago at the
[00:21] micro strategy days where you talked
[00:22] about like Bitcoin future Trends Bitcoin
[00:25] future adoption Trends I think uh was
[00:28] the topic called and I thought it would
[00:30] be interesting to uh talk with you about
[00:33] adoption of Bitcoin how it was in the
[00:35] past how it is going in the future uh
[00:37] and especially what you also seeing with
[00:39] River because you have an unique
[00:41] perspective with river and seeing like
[00:43] institutional adoption but also like
[00:45] peer adoption um but before we start
[00:48] into that how did you like adopt Bitcoin
[00:51] how did you get Find Your Way in in
[00:54] Bitcoin my backstory goes all the way
[00:56] back to when I was in undergrad in
[00:57] college I got really interested in
[00:58] economics and ended up reading some of
[01:02] the classics that I think a lot of
[01:04] people in the space have have read at
[01:05] this
[01:06] point I I I remember distinctly reading
[01:10] the denationalization of money by
[01:11] friederich Hayek and getting really
[01:14] obsessed with this concept of alternate
[01:16] money questioning what is money
[01:18] questioning Central Banking and that
[01:20] sent me down the rabbit hole of wanting
[01:22] to create my own currency that backed by
[01:26] Commodities I couldn't really figure out
[01:28] how to do that or make a business of it
[01:30] given all the regulations and a
[01:33] non-obvious goto Market strategy and
[01:36] then I came across Bitcoin and realized
[01:37] it solve the problem in a much smarter
[01:40] way and have been obsessed ever since so
[01:43] that's my origin story and then I ended
[01:45] up moving to the Bay Area San Francisco
[01:47] Bay area in 2013 to pursue a career in
[01:50] Bitcoin and they been largely doing that
[01:52] ever
[01:53] since very cool very cool uh and let's
[01:57] now talk a little bit about the topic uh
[02:00] will be will be interesting how to see
[02:02] your perspective on that um for me it's
[02:04] really interesting that Bitcoin Grew
[02:07] From that small idea like that idea that
[02:11] like was in one man's head or like maybe
[02:13] few more people involved in that and it
[02:16] grew from the experimental thing all of
[02:19] the sudden to like a big asset where big
[02:22] companies uh big even countries are
[02:24] investing in it and adopting it um how
[02:29] so first of all like why do you think
[02:30] was Bitcoin successful what what what do
[02:32] you think is like the if if it's one
[02:35] reason like what could it be like was it
[02:37] the anonymity of Nakamoto was it like
[02:40] the the the difficulty adjustment is
[02:44] there like one thing that you would
[02:45] point to like that was the major thing
[02:47] why it is successful I think the major
[02:49] trait of Bitcoin that made it successful
[02:51] was the scarcity uh and and the the
[02:54] Dynamics of the of the difficulty
[02:57] adjustment and uh and issuance schedule
[03:00] I think that was key to its success also
[03:02] being first of course was very important
[03:05] and those were the two big things this
[03:07] this this digital scarcity uh really
[03:11] drove the value what drove the
[03:14] attention really cool oh and and how did
[03:17] you uh and how satisfied are you
[03:20] actually when when I look at Bitcoin
[03:23] like when I got came into Bitcoin I was
[03:24] like it's really cool but I kind of
[03:28] expected that it crew faster
[03:30] whenever whenever you come in like oh
[03:32] it's so obvious but then like you you
[03:34] can like people need time for it to wrap
[03:37] the hand around like the things need
[03:39] time but how satisfied are you till now
[03:42] with with the adoption and how it's
[03:43] going with
[03:45] Bitcoin well I'm I think it could always
[03:48] be better I think that we could have
[03:49] always been smarter at building faster
[03:52] and
[03:53] building uh more userfriendly
[03:57] products earlier so could probably be
[04:00] further than it is today if we had had
[04:02] more and higher quality builders in the
[04:04] space through his life that said it has
[04:08] really come a long way and um I don't
[04:11] really think it's that useful to think
[04:13] about oh what could have been what could
[04:14] have been but what's really important is
[04:17] that we're honest about what are the
[04:18] biggest opportunities what are the
[04:19] biggest challenges people face today and
[04:21] how do we solve those how do we attract
[04:23] smart talented Builders to to solve
[04:25] those
[04:27] things right now
[04:29] and and sort of to date Bitcoin has
[04:31] really seen success largely because like
[04:34] I said of the scarcity and it it really
[04:36] has the product Market fit for being a
[04:38] great store of value and
[04:40] long-term uh long-term investment
[04:44] for millions and millions of people
[04:46] that's really what's attracting people
[04:48] in the west at least to mid point I
[04:50] think that because the US dollar is so
[04:53] strong uh globally relatively I
[04:56] obviously there's a lot of inflation
[04:57] with the dollar itself but relative to
[04:59] other currenc it's quite
[05:01] strong that that hasn't created as much
[05:04] of a compelling need for this
[05:06] alternative this alternate um savings
[05:09] tool and medium of exchange globally so
[05:13] uh I think that's the biggest macro
[05:15] Trend that impacts Bitcoin at the moment
[05:18] and we'll see how that plays out so
[05:21] you're saying that because the western
[05:25] civilization with like America and
[05:27] Europe the currency is not as bad as it
[05:31] could be uh people see it as a luxury
[05:34] item and don't uh spend too much time
[05:37] like the pain is not big enough
[05:39] basically right right and for those who
[05:41] are in pain uh in in in countries with
[05:45] really bad currencies of which there are
[05:47] many they they just use dollars they
[05:49] want dollars um they're not using
[05:51] Bitcoin to solve their problems because
[05:53] the dollar still has such a big Network
[05:55] effect and such a huge brand uh that and
[05:59] and it's and it's a much Stabler uh
[06:02] currency as well so what we're seeing is
[06:05] you know Bitcoin is really actually
[06:07] Bitcoin has product Market fit for
[06:09] people who are for wealthier people who
[06:11] are long-term saving uh it does not have
[06:14] product Market fit for the average
[06:17] person uh who has a crappy currency in
[06:21] their country uh uh stable coins and and
[06:24] dollars have a much better product
[06:26] Market fit objectively in those markets
[06:29] today
[06:31] um maybe some are not familiar with the
[06:33] term product Market fit what what does
[06:35] it mean oh yeah good point product
[06:37] Market fit is a concept that determin
[06:40] that that defines whether or not a
[06:43] product is accepted by the market is is
[06:47] the market the market Embraces it and uh
[06:50] and really wants that thing so an
[06:53] example of something with excellent
[06:54] product Market fit is Instagram uh or
[06:57] Facebook um an example something with
[07:01] bad product markets that would be um you
[07:04] know selling water to fish right that's
[07:06] like the sort of ultimate example of a
[07:08] bad product to sell right so uh those
[07:11] are the sort of the two ends of the
[07:13] spectrum what I'm curious about when you
[07:15] see big corporation like apple they
[07:18] having so much cash on their balance
[07:20] sheet uh and they having a lot of great
[07:24] and intelligent people working on them
[07:26] and they are thinking probably like
[07:27] daily what can they do with c what can
[07:30] they do uh better in in doing that
[07:33] Bitcoin had to come up at some in some
[07:36] meeting probably they had to discuss it
[07:38] in in some capacity I I think but maybe
[07:42] I'm wrong here um what why are the
[07:46] really huge corporations I mean there
[07:48] are some examples with Tesla with micro
[07:49] strategies also kind of huge uh and
[07:52] other companies but not not too many of
[07:55] them and when you look at the S&P 500
[07:57] it's only Tesla and maybe
[08:00] soon micro strategy why they are not uh
[08:03] what do you think is the the the reason
[08:05] why they are not doing it is the some
[08:07] legal reason or is it just yeah not the
[08:10] pain not big enough I don't think it's
[08:12] legal uh I think at this point it's
[08:15] just cultural it's un lack of
[08:19] understanding um uh I think that it
[08:23] really just gets down to sort of they
[08:25] don't believe that it aligns with their
[08:28] mandate you know they might they might
[08:31] just it's hard to say how you know a
[08:33] firm like apple or they have sort of
[08:35] this kind of hedge fund thing that
[08:37] manages a lot of their capital I forget
[08:39] the name of it um uh it's hard to know
[08:42] sort of like how how how they think uh
[08:45] maybe they view it like gold and they go
[08:47] well we wouldn't buy gold either because
[08:48] gold is just like this metal and so I I
[08:51] don't know what's going through their
[08:53] heads I don't know why they they don't
[08:55] um but there is a lot of inertia at
[08:58] these firms of how we do things how we
[09:00] what is our framework for
[09:02] investing a lot of Treasury management
[09:05] also isn't about what's the how can we
[09:09] make get the most Alpha how can we grow
[09:11] the value the fastest uh a lot of it is
[09:14] you know rule number one is don't lose
[09:16] the principal value of of the cash of
[09:18] the treasury we're treasury management
[09:20] we're not we're not actually running an
[09:21] investment fund and so um that's also
[09:25] potentially sort of a headwind to any
[09:29] anyone managing a corporate treasury if
[09:31] you don't actually believe in the
[09:33] long-term value of Bin you have deep
[09:35] conviction of that um you know you
[09:37] wouldn't buy it in a treasury because
[09:40] that would run counter to sort of the
[09:42] Gospel of Treasury management which is
[09:44] first don't lose the money ah I guess uh
[09:48] River has incorporated in somehow a
[09:51] Bitcoin
[09:53] strategy oh definitely over half of our
[09:55] treasury is in Bitcoin which is very
[09:57] rational for us because we believe in a
[09:58] long term I me the success of our
[10:00] business uh depends on the success of
[10:03] Bitcoin so it's sort of a no-brainer um
[10:07] but uh but not every company is like
[10:09] that and really what we see is the
[10:10] companies that uh bought that put
[10:14] Bitcoin in their treasury are companies
[10:16] that are run by people I call it an
[10:18] orange pill dictator uh they are run by
[10:20] an individual typically who believes in
[10:22] Bitcoin and can make the unilateral
[10:25] decision to put some of the treasury in
[10:27] Bitcoin a company like like apple uh is
[10:31] not does not pattern match to that one
[10:33] Tim Cook isn't necessarily a big Bitcoin
[10:35] believer but even if he was um he might
[10:39] not be a big enough believer to push at
[10:42] the board level and at the Corp do the
[10:44] corporate politics necessary to do that
[10:46] he might not want to waste his political
[10:48] capital in that because Tim Cook isn't
[10:49] Steve Jobs Tim Cook isn't um you know
[10:52] doesn't have full control of apple right
[10:55] uh whereas Tesla Elon is a dictator and
[10:58] he can say we're buying Bitcoin right so
[11:01] um uh you know micro strategy Michael
[11:04] saor runs micro strategy and he believes
[11:06] in this deeply so even the big public
[11:07] companies they pattern match to this
[11:09] Dynamic um that's why you don't you
[11:11] haven't seen the Walmarts of the world
[11:13] buying Bitcoin it's fascinating from me
[11:15] to see in where it also it reminds me
[11:19] also of how ear we are when when we see
[11:21] the SB 500 and all those big companies
[11:25] um that we seeing and it's like we we're
[11:27] not even close to any sort of major
[11:31] adoption um but one uh big step was I
[11:35] mean the first big step for me
[11:36] institutional adoption was micro
[11:38] strategy in 2020 uh then yeah when we
[11:42] count Salvador also in there uh we could
[11:45] also count that as a big step but a
[11:46] really huge step was also taken this
[11:48] year how do you look at the Bitcoin ETF
[11:51] I think the Bitcoin ETF was a big driver
[11:53] for the institutional I guess the right
[11:56] word is acceptance of of Bitcoin as an
[11:58] asset class
[12:00] institutions by
[12:02] definition or Not by definition but
[12:04] generally unless they're run by a
[12:06] dictator they're typically run by
[12:08] they're typically run by people who are
[12:11] good
[12:12] at getting ahead in an organization and
[12:14] those types of people are not the uh
[12:17] they're not the people who think
[12:18] different who are willing to take big
[12:20] risks who are willing to say who are
[12:23] willing to say I'm gonna do something I
[12:25] deeply believe in even if it risks like
[12:27] my career and so what that means is for
[12:31] most institutions to adopt Bitcoin it
[12:33] has to be something where the person we
[12:37] we're proposing Bitcoin as an investment
[12:39] idea when when you do that you can say
[12:41] hey look other smart people say this is
[12:44] okay now right Black Rock Says Bitcoin
[12:48] is okay I'm not saying Bitcoin is okay
[12:50] Black Rock Says Bitcoin is okay so if
[12:51] this doesn't go well my career Now isn't
[12:54] at risk because because it was black
[12:55] rock that said that Bitcoin was okay so
[12:59] um you know you you you like most people
[13:01] are like that right most people in the
[13:03] world are not um disagreeable types who
[13:07] will take big risks in life and so and
[13:09] most companies are run by people like
[13:12] you know who who are much more
[13:13] conservative and so now all of a sudden
[13:16] all the sort of conservative actors and
[13:18] these big slow moving institutions have
[13:22] uh have have cover uh if if they if they
[13:26] go ahead and move forward with a Bitcoin
[13:28] strategy it's it's fascinating to see
[13:30] for me where the bitco is probably also
[13:32] the reason why we did for the first time
[13:34] ever the alltime high before the Haring
[13:37] which we never did before probably it's
[13:39] the the thef so would be interesting to
[13:41] see River also saw I can remember one
[13:44] chart that River put out like a decision
[13:46] maker chart where you end up on the left
[13:49] H you only buy Bitcoin death if you're
[13:51] legally forced to buy Bitcoin EF other
[13:55] ways it just does not make sense to
[13:57] actually buy and and
[13:59] uh Bitcoin ETF uh which really it it's
[14:03] it kind of brings me to that the
[14:04] question where like when you have the
[14:06] feared currencies now and we have the
[14:09] Fiat system now we have this Bitcoin
[14:11] technology companies like River but also
[14:14] Bitcoin ETF in some sources like this
[14:16] bridge technology from the Fiat World on
[14:19] boarding to this new um Bitcoin way do
[14:23] you also see like that do you see do you
[14:26] see that we are in at some point in the
[14:28] the fully Bitcoin world no matter it's
[14:30] like maybe it's like in 20 years maybe
[14:32] it's 200 years it's really hard to
[14:34] predict the timing of that but do you
[14:36] see the end goal that the whole world is
[14:39] using Bitcoin as a global Reserve asset
[14:43] currency I think we'll keep moving
[14:45] closer to that uh I think it's hard
[14:48] really hard to predict exactly what it
[14:50] looks like
[14:52] um because it's such a complex system if
[14:56] the dollar stops being the reserve
[14:57] currency of the world then that means
[14:59] the world order has changed a lot itself
[15:02] right and it's hard to know what that
[15:04] means how like what's the new steady
[15:05] state if it's not American hegemony what
[15:08] does that look like and what is the
[15:10] impact there of how nation states choose
[15:13] currencies and you know what they use so
[15:17] I think it gets closer to that I don't
[15:19] know if it ever gets exactly 100% there
[15:22] I think there will always be nation
[15:24] states that want their own money and uh
[15:27] I think it'd be sort of
[15:29] delusional to think otherwise maybe
[15:31] competitive forces sort of force most
[15:34] any kind of first class country to have
[15:38] hard money backed by something like
[15:39] Bitcoin I want to think that's that
[15:41] would be the case but it's really hard
[15:42] to know it really is I also think that
[15:46] uh a full Bitcoin standard is kind of
[15:48] Wishful Thinking at this point it it is
[15:52] not impossible but it's really hard to
[15:54] match when we see uh what power uh an
[15:58] Old National currency gies to the
[16:00] government and they don't want to give
[16:01] up that uh and they can also they can
[16:05] always have this like we you you have to
[16:09] pay all taxes in that system you have to
[16:11] pay that and that in our system like it
[16:14] it's hard for me to to imagine that uh a
[16:16] different question you are the CEO and
[16:19] the CTO of river right yes which is
[16:22] interesting because I love by the way
[16:25] Tech Le companies that are led by
[16:28] someone who is this technical so you
[16:30] probably started River and also
[16:32] developed the app yeah I wrote the first
[16:35] code for River um but pretty early on we
[16:37] hired some great Engineers who move
[16:39] things much faster because even even
[16:41] just starting out a company there was a
[16:43] lot of work that wasn't coding right um
[16:45] just getting all the company
[16:46] infrastructure up and running legal
[16:48] stuff fundraising so a lot of my time
[16:50] was already T spoken for and so but I
[16:53] was I always wanted to keep control over
[16:57] the large technical decisions because I
[16:59] had very strong opinions and um wanted
[17:01] to make sure that we didn't make certain
[17:03] mistakes that I've seen made elsewhere
[17:06] and um and so uh it's worked well so far
[17:11] I think especially with the it I think
[17:14] that CEO and CTO sort of joint roles
[17:18] will probably become more popular if I
[17:20] had to guess as technology continues to
[17:23] progress um I think that more and more
[17:26] companies will be moving towards the
[17:27] pattern of hiring a few people as
[17:29] possible who are very high caliber and
[17:31] utilizing technology as much as possible
[17:34] to improve the productivity per person
[17:37] and so um that's how I've always viewed
[17:40] business especially in the technology
[17:42] industry it's how well can you exe how
[17:45] well how correct can you be about a
[17:46] strategy in a vision and then when it
[17:48] comes to executing on that um how few
[17:51] people can you do it with and how much
[17:53] can you utilize computers uh to to to do
[17:56] that um quickly and effectively so um I
[18:01] think being you know engineer Le is is a
[18:03] huge competitive Advantage there
[18:05] absolutely I see it a little bit with
[18:06] the podcast even because I do every day
[18:08] podcast episode and I do like a trailer
[18:10] before I after editing stuff like
[18:12] there's a lot of things that would not
[18:15] have been possible like even five 10
[18:17] years ago because AI is doing so much of
[18:19] the transcripting so much of the
[18:20] summaries so much of the other things uh
[18:23] and probably like the same thing that
[18:25] I'm doing right now in 10 years ago I
[18:28] would need probably at least one
[18:31] employee for that and now I have ai
[18:33] helping me I still have to do a lot of a
[18:36] lot of things with text and a lot of
[18:37] writing a lot of uh how to put something
[18:41] in context how to uh put something out
[18:43] there so people actually want to watch
[18:45] it but still like AI is helping me a lot
[18:48] it's like an employee it's like my best
[18:49] employee who's is not a lot he not
[18:52] expensive but he does his job every
[18:55] time
[18:57] predictable um what what what would you
[18:59] say is like the most important uh when
[19:01] you think of developing an app like
[19:05] River like uh in in in the technical
[19:08] sense the number one most important
[19:10] thing is security um it's it's not
[19:12] messing up it's so security and
[19:14] correctness which are in many ways all
[19:17] roll up to the same goal of keeping our
[19:19] clients funds safe um our clients funds
[19:22] and information uh so that that is
[19:26] number one in our organization we never
[19:28] compromise on those things uh those are
[19:31] just hard lines that um you know we just
[19:34] can't get wrong and so if a projects
[19:36] gets if a project gets delayed because
[19:38] we're not super confident in you know
[19:41] the security or correctness of it then
[19:42] that's just what happens um those are
[19:44] just non-negotiables uh that's not
[19:46] always the case in every business right
[19:49] um but in this industry it has to be uh
[19:52] you know at an Instagram or Facebook
[19:54] that's maybe not as important right
[19:55] you're not dealing with people's money
[19:57] um you can buy us a little bit more
[19:59] towards just moving fast and every now
[20:00] and then having a little bit of an issue
[20:03] um so that that's number one um and then
[20:08] another another one that is a big input
[20:10] into that is simplicity so the the the
[20:14] easiest systems to keep correct and
[20:16] secure are the simplest systems and so
[20:19] uh a big a big thing that I obsess about
[20:24] at the entire company is Simplicity and
[20:26] keeping keeping things as simple as
[20:28] possible keeping systems as simple as
[20:30] possible deleting Parts instead of
[20:32] adding more uh and and um that is really
[20:37] what pays dividends long term is there
[20:40] something that you would uh change in in
[20:43] in the Bitcoin code or is it uh perfect
[20:46] as it is Bitcoin core Bitcoin core yeah
[20:50] the the Bas oh it's very far from
[20:52] perfect but there's also the reality of
[20:55] just systems right just because um like
[20:59] we have stuff at River that I wish we
[21:02] could change but once you have something
[21:04] up and running it's um you now have a
[21:08] cost to change it right and so uh if I
[21:11] could do everything from scratch again
[21:12] would I do would I do things differently
[21:14] yeah there's definitely some things I
[21:16] would do differently in the code and
[21:17] same with Bitcoin core and I think any
[21:19] core developer would agree there's
[21:20] things that they would definitely do
[21:21] differently but once something is up and
[21:23] running it's a very different story and
[21:25] so I think the I think the Bitcoin C
[21:27] team is done a great job uh sort of
[21:30] iteratively moving towards Simplicity um
[21:33] and SEC and and adding more security
[21:35] over time for example uh when Satoshi
[21:39] wrote Bitcoin core it used the library
[21:42] for cryptography called op SSL it was
[21:44] this big Library this big third party
[21:46] dependency it had a bunch of stuff we
[21:48] didn't need and it even had some bugs
[21:50] and weird quirks and stuff it took a few
[21:53] years but eventually they were able to
[21:55] delete that and have a much more
[21:57] streamlined
[21:59] cryptographic uh you know library and
[22:02] code in there but um it had to be done
[22:05] iteratively because you had all these
[22:07] nodes running all over the world you
[22:09] can't just hard break everything and and
[22:11] stop things from working and and and do
[22:13] it all differently so once the plane is
[22:15] flying if there's something you want to
[22:17] change you got to do it without crashing
[22:19] the plane if you are listening to this
[22:21] podcast you might be wondering what is
[22:23] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[22:25] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[22:28] there's two things you have to buy
[22:30] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[22:31] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[22:34] let's focus on the first thing how to
[22:36] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[22:38] only exchange don't deal with the
[22:40] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[22:42] exchange that has an own token or
[22:44] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[22:46] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[22:49] for me the best partner for that and now
[22:53] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[22:55] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[22:57] a self custom the solution where you
[23:00] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[23:03] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[23:06] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[23:09] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[23:11] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[23:15] Bitcoin holders if you have more than
[23:17] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[23:21] have one last thing before we get back
[23:23] to the video I'm really passionate about
[23:25] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[23:27] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[23:30] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[23:33] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[23:36] conference in whole of Europe for all
[23:38] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[23:41] this place in June for all europes it's
[23:43] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[23:46] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[23:48] to come I will do interviews there and I
[23:51] would love to meet you all there use
[23:54] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[23:57] discounts and use the L links down in
[23:59] the description it's it's a big hard
[24:01] hard thing I imagine um but a lot of
[24:04] things probably can be fixed or improved
[24:08] uh anyways not on the Bas layer because
[24:10] there's always compromises to make uh
[24:12] between security scalability and and and
[24:14] all those all those things how do you
[24:17] see then layer to technology there are a
[24:19] lot of different Technologies like fed
[24:22] lightning I heard so many different
[24:25] Technologies already I'm kind of always
[24:27] really polish on on the base layer and
[24:30] I'm trusting in the Bitcoin community
[24:33] that second layers or even third layers
[24:36] will be build in a really great way
[24:38] where we enhance maybe privacy uh fast
[24:41] speed and stuff like that um do do you
[24:44] see any in advance advancement that
[24:47] you're really excited about are you
[24:49] excited about the lightning Network I'm
[24:51] very excited about lightning I think um
[24:54] but you know at the end of the day I
[24:57] think that there's a culture in in
[24:59] Bitcoin and in crypto in
[25:01] general of focusing on Tech in a way
[25:07] that misses the forest for the trees um
[25:09] and what I mean by that is the number
[25:12] one most important
[25:14] thing uh when it comes to building new
[25:18] second layers and like new teas what are
[25:22] we how are we creating value for the end
[25:25] user right what are we doing that
[25:29] creates value to the end user in a way
[25:32] that aligns with the mission of Bitcoin
[25:34] and keeping Bitcoin sound decentralized
[25:38] the useful store of value and a medium
[25:39] of exchange that's my vision for Bitcoin
[25:42] there is no single you know Bitcoin CEO
[25:45] so everyone has a slightly different
[25:47] view my view is everything every change
[25:49] we make to bitcoin should be focused on
[25:51] making Bitcoin more secure more
[25:53] accessible and more easily used as a
[25:55] store of value and a medium of exchange
[25:57] and a censorship self- Sovereign way and
[26:01] so what I am a little bit concerned
[26:05] about with a lot of the current layer
[26:06] two conversations is that they aren't
[26:10] working backwards from that goal like
[26:13] how do we serve the user better they a
[26:15] lot of these conversations are like how
[26:17] can we do crazy new things with a layer
[26:19] two like Defi and um like but why right
[26:24] like what are we what are we solving
[26:26] what value are we trying to provide to
[26:28] users and and does that align with the
[26:31] values of of Bitcoin and I would argue a
[26:33] lot of that stuff doesn't right but it's
[26:36] permissionless and some people say no we
[26:37] want to bring the casino to bitcoin
[26:39] because that would be good for Bitcoin
[26:40] too and I you know I get it um but it
[26:44] doesn't excite me either so lightning is
[26:46] nice because it's very focused on making
[26:48] Bitcoin better as a transactional
[26:50] currency um and so I like that um vaman
[26:55] is interesting uh but at the end of the
[26:57] day
[26:59] we're not seeing a lot of user like
[27:00] really quickly growing user traction
[27:02] here um and I think the core of that is
[27:05] that the is that there's really two
[27:09] things that have uh massive product
[27:12] Market fit when it comes to layer tws
[27:15] and Def and and and all this stuff
[27:18] gambling so like the defi World which we
[27:21] see with saana meme coins and all this
[27:24] stuff or dollars which people call
[27:26] stable coins I just call them dollar
[27:28] because that's what they are um and uh
[27:31] and that's where I think there's an
[27:32] interesting sort of path is bringing
[27:35] dollars to lightning uh I think that's
[27:38] going to be pretty interesting for
[27:40] people um so I'm pretty interested about
[27:42] the developments around Tapo assets and
[27:44] stuff like that uh what what dollars to
[27:47] to lightning how does what do you mean
[27:49] by that uh tap rot assets is a um
[27:53] project that lightning Labs is working
[27:55] on that allows stable coins like T to be
[27:58] transferable over the lightning Network
[28:00] which I think is uh would would probably
[28:04] be way more popular than transferring
[28:05] Bitcoin over lightning to be honest yeah
[28:08] it's it's it's it's basically the use
[28:10] case that you want to send your dollars
[28:13] outside of the bit outside of the
[28:15] banking system so that's the basically
[28:18] the lightning dollars you can send
[28:20] dollars outside of the banking system
[28:23] but it's still dollar so it's kind of
[28:25] kind of inside the bank is one of the
[28:28] things that I think about the the medium
[28:31] of exchange side of things in Bitcoin
[28:33] and the transactional side of Bitcoin is
[28:35] like we we just really early on
[28:39] bitcoiners don't want to spend their
[28:41] Bitcoin they they want to keep their
[28:43] Bitcoin and they want to just huddle
[28:46] them and maybe spend them on a Bitcoin
[28:49] meet up or like when they have some SS
[28:52] on a lightning wet or something like
[28:53] that so a lot of the development is
[28:56] still will come because as you say
[28:59] product Market fit when there's not a
[29:01] lot of Bitcoin as wanting to spend the
[29:04] Bitcoin why should why should a lot of
[29:07] companies develop stuff exactly for that
[29:10] would be futuristic companies that see
[29:12] five years 10 years ahead where probably
[29:14] more and more bitcoiners want to spend
[29:16] the Bitcoin uh and then there's also the
[29:18] tax implications most of the time you
[29:20] have to pay tax when you spend Bitcoin
[29:22] but that's uh that's it um which leads
[29:24] me Al to my the next question and we
[29:26] teased it a little bit in the beginning
[29:28] we talked about the past of Bitcoin how
[29:30] do you see or what future trends of
[29:33] adoption uh do you see especially with
[29:36] the with the insides that you also have
[29:38] with River um what what are you
[29:40] currently seeing so we're very focused
[29:43] on the United States and so what we see
[29:46] is bitcoin's continuing its trajectory
[29:49] as being this thing people save in uh in
[29:51] the United States the the situation in
[29:54] the US um people's Baseline is is
[29:57] dollars and they've seen their prices go
[30:00] up crazy amounts in dollar terms uh and
[30:04] so so it makes them question things uh
[30:08] and and it and it creates a lack of
[30:09] trust in US institutions and people look
[30:12] for something different and I think this
[30:13] high level macro theme is why more and
[30:15] more people and businesses are are
[30:17] saving in Bitcoin and so that's the
[30:20] trend we see it definitely comes in
[30:22] waves for example this month is a little
[30:25] bit slower is is actually a good amount
[30:27] slower than the last two months before
[30:29] uh it has this very cyclical nature uh
[30:33] you know price movement definitely still
[30:35] very heavily
[30:37] impacts new people on boarding people
[30:40] get just much more excited when the
[30:41] Bitcoin price moves and then when it's
[30:44] somewhat flat stable so these are all
[30:46] the general trends that we see but
[30:48] overall the the high level trend is is
[30:51] up and to the right in terms of
[30:53] adoption what is the most exciting that
[30:56] uh that you are looking forward in in b
[30:58] Co we a lot of people also talk about
[31:00] like oh the Bitcoin ETF is now here will
[31:03] bring a lot of money in the next like
[31:04] one two whatever years in there uh but
[31:08] what's next like we have already
[31:10] National States kind of there will be
[31:12] more coming probably we have public
[31:14] liter companies there will be more
[31:16] coming uh is it right now just is is the
[31:20] basis now built and now we're just
[31:21] getting more of all the bases or is
[31:23] there some some I don't know bonds or
[31:26] whatever that you're looking for to to
[31:28] to catalyze an adoption I don't know how
[31:31] many big sort of more milestones in
[31:34] terms of the first happening but I think
[31:38] there is
[31:39] still so much to ha like there's still
[31:42] so much adoption left from institutions
[31:45] and individuals uh it has only just
[31:47] begun even for people who have some
[31:50] Bitcoin right there's they're still very
[31:52] early in their journey I think that a
[31:55] lot of people who own Bitcoin today will
[31:58] just continue to get deeper into Bitcoin
[32:00] as a as a savings tool um they'll keep
[32:05] converting more and more of their wealth
[32:07] and income into Bitcoin and so not only
[32:11] is there still a lot of people and
[32:13] companies who haven't bought any Bitcoin
[32:15] which will change there are a lot of
[32:17] people who have only dipped their toes
[32:18] in the water and will keep going deeper
[32:22] so I see that as a you know just a major
[32:27] maybe it's a little more boring but
[32:29] that's what I see happening over the
[32:30] coming
[32:31] years it's it's it's it's yeah the the
[32:36] the Tipping do is really really cool I
[32:39] see it a lot when when friends come in
[32:40] and they're like oh how how do I GNA buy
[32:43] Bitcoin are gonna get involved and yeah
[32:46] this and then oh yeah I bought my first
[32:49] 10 EUR of Bitcoin and stuff like that
[32:51] and then I come back in a few months and
[32:54] they're like oh yeah I have like one
[32:56] 2,000 EUR now Bitcoin and and one friend
[32:59] that I met like a year ago and now I met
[33:02] him again and he's like now 80% in
[33:04] Bitcoin and he just started out and it's
[33:06] this is like a current like this is a a
[33:09] cycle Trend that I see all over again
[33:12] like between coming in they they had the
[33:14] problems when they come in but then they
[33:16] they came in they get educated they
[33:19] watch some podcast they get some news
[33:21] they research to get some books and then
[33:23] all of the sudden it clicks for them and
[33:25] you're like oh this this Bitcoin thing
[33:27] makes actually sends and and I'm at this
[33:30] point where I'm like I would have a hard
[33:32] time picking anything else than Bitcoin
[33:35] at this moment I I I I would not know
[33:38] like maybe a question for you like what
[33:40] would you buy at now when when Bitcoin
[33:43] would not be there uh what would I buy
[33:45] if I didn't have Bitcoin yeah um tech
[33:50] stocks I would I would just buy the F
[33:53] what my investment strategy is always
[33:55] buy what you think the future looks like
[33:58] so um I think the future I think tech
[34:01] companies will continue to be the ones
[34:03] driving technology in the future forward
[34:05] so that's that's what I would be
[34:07] by really cool um before we come closer
[34:10] to the end rtin uh there's this theme
[34:14] where bitcoiners are really Freedom
[34:16] loving in general like when when you
[34:18] come to bitcoiners they have different
[34:19] views about different things they are
[34:21] weaken there are like uh people that
[34:23] only eat meat I forgot the name
[34:26] carnivore uh uh there are different
[34:29] types of people in the Bitcoin Community
[34:31] like there a lot of pams um but it all
[34:34] kind of comes down to their freedom
[34:36] loving they want more individual Freedom
[34:39] this is I I
[34:41] never uh met the Bitcoin that is against
[34:44] that um but there are a lot of uh
[34:48] outside of the Bitcoin Community a lot
[34:50] of forces that like want to restrict the
[34:52] individual want to regulate things they
[34:54] want to put constraints on the world on
[34:57] on the freedom that we have um will will
[35:02] bitcoiners or and Bitcoin uh Force the
[35:06] world or embrace the world to be more
[35:09] freedom freedom loving if Bitcoin
[35:12] adoption also grows or as I also can see
[35:16] it are we just in a really early group
[35:19] uh that is freedom loving and and
[35:22] curious about the world or or is or is
[35:25] Bitcoin actually changing Society
[35:28] fundamentally I I think and I and I like
[35:32] to believe that Bitcoin will continue to
[35:34] change people I think that when you
[35:38] start going down that rabbit hole you
[35:41] start to see things somewhat differently
[35:43] I think a subset of people already saw
[35:45] it that way and then were gravitated to
[35:46] bitcoin I think that was a very early
[35:48] group of people um I think I was like
[35:51] part of that group I think that um and
[35:54] there will always be people like that
[35:55] but that will always be a niche that was
[35:56] sort of like the really disagreeable
[35:58] wacky people that said all the way the
[36:02] way thing we're doing things today
[36:03] doesn't make sense um most people won't
[36:06] be that
[36:07] way but Bitcoin is a really
[36:09] non-threatening way to start taking
[36:11] people down that philosophy of Freedom
[36:14] now on the other side of the coin what
[36:16] also matters is how strong the opposing
[36:19] forces become uh and you know how how
[36:22] much how effective are they at
[36:24] controlling uh society and preventing
[36:28] people from seeing the seeing the light
[36:31] and it's hard to say uh it's hard to say
[36:34] but I think we're winning um I think
[36:37] we're winning but we have a long ways to
[36:38] go and Bitcoin doesn't fix everything
[36:40] magically right there's a lot of sort of
[36:43] waking up that people have to do outside
[36:45] of Bitcoin but
[36:48] um we'll see yeah it's it's it's I'm
[36:51] often asking myself like where are we in
[36:53] the Bitcoin phase and also like as you
[36:56] said Bitcoin doesn't fix everything it's
[36:58] I always bring up that sand example if
[37:01] like if Fe standard is like running on
[37:03] Sand running on M uh you can kind of run
[37:06] you can kind of do your things but it's
[37:09] hard because sand is dragging you down
[37:10] it's it's like the steps are hard and
[37:12] like Bitcoin is this like running on a
[37:15] solid street it's way easier for you to
[37:18] just run on a solid Street uh but you
[37:21] still have to run like if if you don't
[37:23] do anything on a proof of work Bitcoin
[37:25] standard you you will get nowh anyways
[37:28] uh but the the question that I thought
[37:30] of is in my mind are we in the DED join
[37:35] us stage when you think of like this
[37:37] this four steps like they love at us
[37:39] they ignore us uh and then they then
[37:42] they join us or they then they fights
[37:44] and then they join us are they still are
[37:46] they still fighting us kind of with like
[37:49] the Bitcoin ETF looks like they are
[37:51] joining us but then there's Elizabeth
[37:53] war and Jamie Dam or that camp that
[37:57] still fights us uh do you have like an
[38:00] explanation like where where are we kind
[38:02] of in this this phes I I think
[38:05] that optimistically we're towards the
[38:08] end of the they fight us phase very
[38:11] optimistically but we don't know there's
[38:14] been some early signs in the last few
[38:15] weeks at least in the United States um I
[38:18] think a lot of it comes down to sort of
[38:20] what the presidential what happens with
[38:22] the presidential election um I think
[38:24] that
[38:26] uh we'll see in November sort of you
[38:29] know if Trump wins I would say that
[38:31] we're at least temporarily out of the
[38:33] they fight us phase um if he loses I
[38:35] don't think that's going to be the case
[38:37] but it's also possible that Trump going
[38:39] pro Bitcoin will cause the Democrats to
[38:42] say you know what we're going to ease up
[38:43] on this too because this isn't winning
[38:44] us any votes um and our donor and it's
[38:47] also just pissing off our donors like we
[38:48] just have nothing to gain from being
[38:50] anti- Bitcoin there's there's no one
[38:51] who's voting for a party because they're
[38:53] anti- Bitcoin um it only hurts you to be
[38:55] anti- Bitcoin so if that's what we're
[38:57] seeing happening which there's signs
[38:59] that we are then then that's promising
[39:02] um but we'll see I don't know for
[39:05] sure I'm kind of Envy of the USA because
[39:08] in in the European Union we also have
[39:10] elections on the 9th of June I think uh
[39:14] there is no sayings of Bitcoin like this
[39:18] like it's not even close to being a
[39:20] topic and nobody discusses it uh uh not
[39:24] on the European level not on the
[39:26] Austrian level there's no sign of any
[39:30] any Bitcoin or crypto or oh let's let's
[39:33] figure out what's the actual problem of
[39:35] of uh the inflation is when when it
[39:38] comes to the inflation topic yeah
[39:39] there's Ukraine war yeah that's not the
[39:42] reason why we have inflation but yeah
[39:44] it's it's it's funny to see so I'm I'm
[39:46] really Envy of the USA that they at
[39:48] least talk about it at least there topic
[39:50] about
[39:51] it yeah it's promising it's promising
[39:55] definitely um before we come to end
[39:57] routine uh is there any uh achievement
[40:00] in in in Bitcoin community that that you
[40:03] made that you're especially proud of or
[40:05] like what's the achievement in your
[40:07] Bitcoin uh career that you are most
[40:09] proud
[40:10] of I think other than starting river
[40:13] which I think Takes the Cake for what
[40:14] I'm most proud of and what I'm still
[40:16] focused on I think was running the San
[40:18] Francisco Bitcoin developer meetups that
[40:20] brought a lot of very smart people
[40:22] together and created a um a forum for
[40:26] people to learn about Bitcoin at a
[40:29] technical level and um and for some of
[40:32] the best Minds in Bitcoin to just come
[40:34] into the room together and share their
[40:35] insights with others and create new
[40:37] ideas and so that was many years ago uh
[40:40] but I still you know people still tell
[40:43] me how much they enjoyed those and it
[40:45] just always makes me feel really good to
[40:46] hear so I think it was a running San
[40:48] Francisco Bitcoin developer Meetup I
[40:50] love that a lot um and what are you
[40:53] currently passionate about besides
[40:55] Bitcoin like I'm always interested in
[40:57] bitcoiners lives because they are really
[41:00] deeply uh thinkers they are usually in
[41:04] in a lot of ways really learning deeply
[41:08] about stuff or doing interesting
[41:10] activities so like what is what are you
[41:13] currently really passionate about
[41:14] besides
[41:15] Bitcoin so uh I love boxing so I'm you
[41:20] know I really love boxing and uh just
[41:23] training and uh I don't know why I just
[41:25] gravitate towards it it's a a sport I
[41:28] love um um and I also just love history
[41:31] and just keep going on historical rabbit
[41:34] holes and learning about Humanity I just
[41:36] I and I I think just like learning about
[41:38] humans um while technology is important
[41:41] I do think understanding the world is
[41:44] more important than understanding
[41:45] technology uh and understanding where
[41:48] we're going as a civilization where my
[41:51] country is going into society so
[41:53] philosophy history um and just all of
[41:56] the explanation for why things are the
[41:58] way they are and how to use those tools
[41:59] to predict what's coming so um I really
[42:03] I really like that kind of stuff do do
[42:05] you like the go direction that we are
[42:07] going I don't know I don't really think
[42:09] about it necessarily of like do I like
[42:13] it or not um I think it's very
[42:16] complicated
[42:18] and it's more like I try to focus on
[42:21] like what matters um you know what
[42:24] figuring out what matters what is the
[42:26] right lever for me to try to pull in my
[42:29] own life and as a business um uh I think
[42:33] that there's a lot of promising signs I
[42:35] think there's a lot of
[42:37] challenges I'm an eternal optimist
[42:39] because I think it's just irrational to
[42:40] not be optimistic it just leads to a
[42:42] miserable life so I'm always optimistic
[42:45] but I try to figure out what can I do to
[42:47] make sure that the expected outcome for
[42:50] civilization is is
[42:52] higher and for my own life and my own
[42:55] family and and the time is so exciting
[42:58] like we we just kind of started the
[43:00] internet Revolution now it's the Bitcoin
[43:02] and Sun money Revolution is is is on the
[43:05] way uh and then there's AI now coming
[43:08] this which leads me actually to to my
[43:10] endro tee we have endro te in the
[43:12] podcast where the previous guest is
[43:13] asking a question uh for the next guest
[43:16] without knowing who the next guest is uh
[43:19] and the previous guest asked a question
[43:21] for you which uh follows do you think
[43:24] that EI will create create l L working
[43:27] opportunities for people or more and why
[43:30] I don't know exactly how AI ends up but
[43:33] my guess is over the next 20 years it
[43:35] creates
[43:36] opportunities um I think it deletes a
[43:39] lot of White Collar middle management
[43:42] sort of work I think organizations get
[43:44] leaner and more efficient but I think
[43:47] overall that makes Society more
[43:48] productive and leads to new
[43:50] opportunities that are hard to predict
[43:52] so overall I would say it'll lead to
[43:54] more productive society and probably a
[43:56] better quality life for everybody um
[43:59] there will be some pain in certain
[44:00] careers but I think that everyone will
[44:02] adjust to thank you um where can like
