[00:00] these ETFs are coming in with more money
[00:02] than they've ever had for Bitcoin and
[00:04] Bitcoin are already gone the potential
[00:06] for a super cycle the potential for a
[00:08] million doll Bitcoin by 2026 it's on the
[00:11] table the important thing is that we
[00:13] have Bitcoin and everybody can choose to
[00:15] just be on chain the amount of buying
[00:17] power that's coming in from the ETFs is
[00:19] insane people are waking up to the fact
[00:21] that something is
[00:22] wrong why is it Bitcoin only like why do
[00:26] you think that we uh only have Bitcoin
[00:31] uh that has a really realistic chance
[00:33] that it will survive and be the Bas
[00:34] layer of everything why can it not be
[00:36] something else like that and uh I mean
[00:40] basically when I got started in in
[00:43] Bitcoin it's like I got started in the
[00:45] shitcoins like the peak Peak 2020 rally
[00:49] is kind of when I first got in and I
[00:52] just I was investing into the the
[00:56] shitcoins and I didn't really know much
[00:58] about it at that point but then as like
[01:01] getting into more about crypto and
[01:05] Bitcoin it's it became pretty obvious
[01:08] that Bitcoin was different I think it
[01:11] gets down to the trilemma so the
[01:14] decentralization security and
[01:17] scalability and Bitcoin was the only one
[01:20] that was able to achieve the full
[01:22] decentralization and full
[01:24] security
[01:27] so from that perspective it's because
[01:31] um humans aren't able to control the
[01:34] network they aren't able to or basically
[01:38] any Authority isn't able to control the
[01:40] network and then change the network and
[01:43] then potentially destroy the network so
[01:46] it's the fact that we have the security
[01:48] that we know that there will only ever
[01:51] be 21 million Bitcoin and that no one
[01:54] else is going to be able to um change
[01:57] the network so like the integrity of the
[02:00] network I would say is the biggest deal
[02:02] on why it's Bitcoin and not
[02:05] crypto yeah it has to be dentalized if
[02:08] if it's like uh if if you want a
[02:11] decentralized and uh State resistant
[02:14] currency it has to solve the first
[02:17] problem statement that it is centralized
[02:19] and all the altcoins fail at the first
[02:22] thing like the first problem statement
[02:24] they even come up with being
[02:27] decentralized they fail so does not
[02:30] matter that they have this and that and
[02:32] that's faster more scalability whatever
[02:35] they they claim to have it doesn't
[02:37] matter because the first problem
[02:39] statement with they're being
[02:41] decentralized is not true uh so it's uh
[02:44] I think really really cool and you also
[02:46] said you're coming lately more more into
[02:49] austan economics which is really really
[02:52] cool I'm you know myself based in
[02:55] Austria the current it was funny because
[02:58] when I got into Bitcoin I was like why
[03:00] are they all talking about Austrian
[03:01] economics there's nothing special about
[03:04] the economics in Austria it's like
[03:05] really shitty actually uh and then I
[03:08] discovered oh it's not about the current
[03:10] Austrian economics it's about the
[03:12] Austrian economics philosophy why do you
[03:14] why are you now lately getting into this
[03:16] like why are you U um motivated about
[03:19] Austrian economics yeah I think putting
[03:21] Austrian economics together with Bitcoin
[03:24] it kind of like paints this picture of
[03:27] like truth when yeah I think I mean
[03:30] Bitcoin in general kind of is like a
[03:32] lens of Truth where it lets you see
[03:35] through like all of these lies that have
[03:37] been created about money and economics
[03:40] that is like I like to say in The Matrix
[03:43] that was created because um The
[03:47] Authority that wanted control over money
[03:50] and then basically propagated the
[03:52] Keynesian economic theories
[03:55] so like that's been circulating like
[03:59] within po ations for Generations is this
[04:02] the Keynesian economic model and I mean
[04:05] it's all that they basically taught me
[04:07] in public school and I go to Cal Eastbay
[04:10] now and it's mostly like that's the
[04:13] economics that they teach and they teach
[04:14] it almost as if it's fact I mean Bitcoin
[04:19] with the lens of Truth it allowed me to
[04:21] challenge those economic theories and
[04:24] then to also see that they're actually
[04:27] wrong um I'm just diving into rothbard
[04:32] and Hayek and getting into um some of
[04:37] their economic theories and their
[04:38] theories about money and kind of how
[04:42] they how Hayek combed keyy and economics
[04:46] like in the early days of um like
[04:49] Central Banking in America and it's just
[04:52] it's just so crazy to me how most of the
[04:55] Austrian economic theories were
[04:58] suppressed and how most people really
[05:00] don't even know who hyek and rothbart
[05:03] and mesus they don't really know who
[05:05] they are because I was like I like talk
[05:08] to my dad all the time about I I
[05:10] basically orange pilled him
[05:12] but all of his economic theories and
[05:15] ideas about economics are canes and he
[05:17] doesn't even know who the Austrian
[05:19] economics professors or or economists he
[05:22] doesn't really know who they are
[05:25] so um I guess and and I want to like
[05:28] look to the Future fure on what the
[05:30] future of money actually looks like and
[05:34] it's pretty clear that the Fiat
[05:37] experiment um and Keynesian economics
[05:39] that were used to justify the Fiat
[05:42] experiment it's pretty clear that that's
[05:45] not uh it didn't work and that we have
[05:48] to try something new or or go back to
[05:53] highx thesis and then turn back to the
[05:56] Austrian economic model for the future
[05:58] of money um for people that maybe are
[06:02] new now in the Bitcoin space like I'm
[06:04] always aware that there's when there's a
[06:05] Bitcoin conversation there's always like
[06:08] some new listeners in the in the
[06:10] conversation that are like just now
[06:12] coming into the rabbit hole and just now
[06:14] like oh what is this a economics what is
[06:16] this Bitcoin and maybe they like just
[06:18] randomly click on a video so um for
[06:21] people that don't know or like earlier
[06:23] in the in the education phase can you
[06:26] briefly explain like what is KES in
[06:28] economics why is this wrong and and
[06:31] what's then the opposite with with
[06:32] Austrian economics and and why is it
[06:35] suiting so good to bitcoin um can you
[06:38] briefly give us like an overview of that
[06:41] yeah so the Austrian economics is more
[06:45] of studying like human behavior and how
[06:48] the free market will operate based on um
[06:51] the individuals incentive like to seek
[06:55] their best interest their best
[06:57] self-interest um and
[07:00] then Keynesian economics is more of
[07:04] justifying the centralized planning of
[07:07] money and then being able to justify
[07:11] like oh when when we need to print money
[07:13] or when we need to contract the money
[07:15] supply or all of these models and data
[07:19] points where they can say have um cause
[07:23] and effect relationships with each other
[07:25] to justify more government interaction
[07:28] or more Central calized planning to um
[07:32] help or save e the economy that wouldn't
[07:35] otherwise function without their um
[07:39] without their man manipulation in the
[07:41] market um Austrian economics
[07:44] applies to the Bitcoin model because
[07:47] there is no Authority on bitcoin
[07:50] basically because it's the decentralized
[07:52] network and there is no Authority that
[07:53] control that can control any aspect of
[07:56] the free market that's in
[07:58] Bitcoin that it allows the Austrian
[08:01] economic theories to play out because
[08:05] it's simply just a free market where
[08:07] everybody's incentivized to seek their
[08:10] best
[08:11] self-interest it's amazing for me also
[08:13] when I think about it because um like
[08:16] when you get Bitcoin when you're in the
[08:19] state of getting Bitcoin uh you're kind
[08:21] of getting relaxed about it like I was
[08:24] getting into Bitcoin first in 2020 so
[08:26] it's been now getting to four years of
[08:29] being in Bitcoin and the first one two
[08:33] like even two two and a half years I was
[08:35] really vocal about it I was telling
[08:37] everybody at work telling everybody in
[08:39] the family about Bitcoin but the more
[08:41] and more I actually got Bitcoin I got
[08:44] really relaxed and chilled about it and
[08:46] I'm now having the podcast I do my
[08:48] tweets but outside of that uh in my
[08:52] normal environment with family I rarely
[08:54] bring up Bitcoin I wait till someone
[08:56] else brings it up and then we can talk
[08:58] about it because I know Bitcoin will
[09:01] just happen like if I scream about
[09:04] Bitcoin all day long it will not uh um
[09:08] make a difference and if I don't say
[09:10] anything about Bitcoin it will also not
[09:12] change anything Bitcoin will just come
[09:15] uh and there's like um professor in our
[09:18] University that I was now I'm not there
[09:21] anymore uh in he's teaching about it
[09:24] security and he always starts with
[09:26]  on bitcoin the first 10 minutes
[09:29] for some reason uh and I had a
[09:32] conversation with him and I told him you
[09:34] know that you are making advertisement
[09:36] for Bitcoin right that the the act that
[09:39] you are actually talking about Bitcoin
[09:41] where you should talk about it security
[09:44] uh is making all the students questions
[09:47] like why is he talking about Bitcoin and
[09:49] there were like people uh there there
[09:52] will be always like there like 500
[09:53] people sitting there at least five
[09:55] people are like why is he not talking
[09:57] about Bitcoin let's Google Bitcoin and
[09:59] then they going to podcast they're like
[10:01] oh I'm now Bitcoin marxy two years
[10:03] later so so no matter what happens uh no
[10:08] matter what's happening like people talk
[10:10]  about Bitcoin people talk good
[10:11] about Bitcoin people don't talk about
[10:13] Bitcoin it gets rare and rarer that
[10:15] people don't have an opinion on bitcoin
[10:18] H it will just happen with the natural
[10:20] state of of the adoption of some money
[10:23] but it's always interesting for me how
[10:25] this can happen and and then I'm
[10:27] interested in your feel like uh how do
[10:30] you think we will adopt Bitcoin in the
[10:32] like next 10 20 50 years uh and and what
[10:37] what will be the the hurdles and what
[10:38] will be like the the the the drivers of
[10:42] that Bitcoin adoption I think number go
[10:44] up technology like the price itself is a
[10:47] big driver because uh I see it also like
[10:50] in the normal environment all of the
[10:51] sudden people are now talking about more
[10:53] and more about Bitcoin it's still kind
[10:56] of weirdly calm for the high price we
[10:58] have now I don't know if if it that's
[11:01] also your your uh your feeling yeah I
[11:03] mean when the price goes up it's like
[11:05] everybody that I talk to in my circle is
[11:08] like hitting me up like oh oh yeah
[11:10] Bitcoin like how do I get in on this
[11:12] because it's it's the price is running
[11:14] up and everybody's getting excited so
[11:16] that's that's always fun because I I
[11:17] could basically talk about Bitcoin
[11:19] forever but how adoption happens for one
[11:23] I think it needs to happen because
[11:27] um like the corruption of money is just
[11:30] real and we're I mean we're seeing it in
[11:33] countries like
[11:34] Argentina Lebanon like Venezuela where
[11:37] their Fiat currencies have already
[11:39] hyperinflated and then their people have
[11:42] to be desperate for an alternative for
[11:45] money and I think the biggest hurdle was
[11:48] probably the educational hurdle like for
[11:50] at least like the early adoption of
[11:53] Bitcoin um because I mean I'd imagine I
[11:56] don't really know but in Argentina Ina
[11:59] it's like from my perspective knowing
[12:02] about what Bitcoin is like they have to
[12:05] have a significant demand for Bitcoin
[12:08] because if their if their currency is
[12:10] running away like prices are changing
[12:12] every day that seems pretty logical so
[12:16] just simply educating people about what
[12:19] Bitcoin is is one step but then also
[12:23] scaling the
[12:24] technology like I think I think payments
[12:27] will they'll be a bunch of different
[12:30] ways that people will make payments on
[12:31] bitcoin like layer one um or lightning
[12:37] or like the fent and the liquid
[12:40] protocols people are building new things
[12:43] on top of Bitcoin that will probably all
[12:45] eat up some market share for
[12:47] transactions in Bitcoin
[12:50] but like as it sits today like I feel I
[12:54] feel like we need the alternative now
[12:57] and and a lot of um other countries
[13:00] outside the United States definitely
[13:02] need it now but even even in the United
[13:04] States it's like we still have inflation
[13:08] like younger like my generation I'm 23
[13:11] there's going to college having a um a
[13:15] big big debt to pay for your college
[13:18] education and then going into the
[13:20] workforce and really barely even being
[13:22] able to support yourself on on like
[13:25] getting a degree from a good school
[13:28] people waking up to the fact that
[13:30] something is
[13:31] wrong
[13:33] so I think we need a new technology and
[13:37] that's something that I'm working on
[13:38] right now is um something that can scale
[13:43] the transactions and allow people to
[13:45] transact completely in Bitcoin and exit
[13:47] the Fiat monetary system but like now
[13:50] like it could be a choice a like Fiat
[13:54] money or Bitcoin and obviously at that
[13:58] point if they can make that decision it
[14:00] makes it a lot easier Yeah you mentioned
[14:03] it also before the podcast that you're
[14:05] working on something that this like
[14:06] issued on top of Bitcoin uh what exactly
[14:10] like is that and how does it work yeah
[14:12] so this this aligns with um
[14:16] Hayak and his thesis was
[14:20] that we need to a take the money out of
[14:23] the hands of government in that Sly
[14:26] roundabout way because he feels like
[14:28] there's no way that government's going
[14:30] to relinquish the control that they
[14:31] already
[14:32] have but he also argued that there
[14:35] should be a free market for currency so
[14:39] that anybody can issue their own
[14:41] currency and it is up to the market
[14:44] whether they choose to use that currency
[14:46] or not and like that Austrian economics
[14:49] like no Authority kind of thought
[14:51] process would be okay you're just
[14:53] incentivizing people to use it and if it
[14:57] provides them a
[14:59] a the service that they need which is
[15:02] transacting in Bitcoin then you can
[15:05] fulfill that demand yeah Hayek Hayek
[15:08] would argue taking the the money out of
[15:10] the hands of the government and then
[15:13] allowing a free market of private
[15:16] currency issuers to compete for market
[15:19] share for money and I think that Bitcoin
[15:24] is that base layer like gold was the
[15:27] base layer to the Fiat that people and
[15:29] or that that nation states printed their
[15:32] Fiat on top of and then obviously
[15:34] hyperinflated and imposed their Monopoly
[15:37] which made it um which made them be able
[15:41] to move away from the gold standard and
[15:43] then basically propagate their Keynesian
[15:45] economic models and theories so that
[15:47] people can continue to use the Fiat
[15:50] money
[15:52] but I think that there's going to be a
[15:56] similar similar Market to how Fe worked
[15:59] on top of gold except for because
[16:02] there's no Authority on bitcoin and that
[16:05] it's free and
[16:07] transparent that there's going to be um
[16:10] a free market for private currency
[16:12] issuers on top of Bitcoin where
[16:15] basically what I'm building I call it
[16:19] sat
[16:20] blockchain um is a private currency that
[16:23] will be backed 100% by the Bitcoin but
[16:26] the SAT blockchain is a centralized ized
[16:29] entity
[16:31] so and and you know that's kind of like
[16:34] a stigma in the Bitcoin space where you
[16:35] say not your keys not your wallet or or
[16:37] not your coins or um and they're really
[16:41] against the centralization of Bitcoin
[16:44] but I feel like we need centralized
[16:47] service providers on top of Bitcoin to
[16:50] allow Bitcoin to reach the hands of more
[16:53] people it's like it's just like the the
[16:56] ETFs it's like okay we have
[16:59] almost 300,000 Bitcoin in ETFs those are
[17:03] centralized
[17:05] custodians or we have like mining pools
[17:08] where you'll subscribe to the mining
[17:10] pool and that's a a centralized
[17:13] custodian um or an exchange that's a
[17:15] that's a centralized custodian so I feel
[17:17] like it's not a problem to have a
[17:20] centralized custodian to be able to
[17:23] facilitate
[17:24] payments and if there's a free market
[17:27] for um
[17:30] if there's a free market competition for
[17:32] those companies and those service
[17:33] providers on top of Bitcoin that are
[17:36] providing the service of payments on
[17:38] bitcoin then that free market can um
[17:41] hold together the discipline and um
[17:44] create efficiencies and Innovation on
[17:46] top of Bitcoin and for payments um
[17:51] which I also believe that it needs to be
[17:55] a full Reserve like we can't have a
[17:58] fractional Reserve we can't create paper
[18:00] Bitcoin but that's the um the discipline
[18:04] that I'm talking about a free market
[18:05] would enforce because if we have
[18:08] multiple currency issuers on top of
[18:11] Bitcoin um if one of them chose to
[18:15] devalue their currency as in create more
[18:19] of their issued currency than they have
[18:21] in Bitcoin and reserves then they would
[18:24] be devaluing their customers or
[18:26] devaluing their currency which would be
[18:28] stealing from their customers so that's
[18:31] how I think a free market would enforce
[18:34] that discipline of having that full
[18:36] reserve and then if it's always
[18:39] auditable to where you can um go back
[18:43] and verify that it is in fact fully
[18:46] reserved um then I think
[18:49] that's what the future of money is going
[18:52] to look like I'm super excited to
[18:54] announce that this podcast got the first
[18:57] ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[19:01] from day one and they teach and preach
[19:04] self custody this is my go to exchange
[19:08] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[19:10] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[19:12] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[19:15] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[19:18] this podcast use code Robin and click
[19:21] the link in the description I mean there
[19:23] are two really really interesting uh
[19:25] parts we can more talk about deeply uh
[19:27] about the
[19:29] the first part is that um Bitcoin is
[19:33] kind of like not um replacing Visa or
[19:37] Mastercard Bitcoin is replacing the
[19:39] central banks in my opinion it's like
[19:42] the the foundation of everything and
[19:44] then people can talk uh can make stuff
[19:47] on top of it and then we come to the
[19:49] second part where people build on top of
[19:52] Bitcoin and the great part is that uh
[19:56] you can do whatever you want on bitcoin
[19:59] uh uh and people can freely decide if
[20:01] they like that solution or if they like
[20:04] uh Fint lightning or whatever they want
[20:07] they can freely choose what payment
[20:09] service provider they have because
[20:11] lightning also is like most of the
[20:13] people that use lightning use wallet of
[20:15] Satoshi which is a centralized Service
[20:18] as as I see it uh and then there there's
[20:21] fent with the federal um the the F
[20:24] federals uh so there are so many
[20:27] different solutions and you can even
[20:29] make an argument that Bitcoin ETFs is a
[20:31] layer on top of Bitcoin you can make
[20:33] argument that uh uh that like PayPal and
[20:37] stuff like that or the cash app the
[20:39] these are things on top of Bitcoin that
[20:42] are centralized services so this will
[20:45] happening anyways like we have will have
[20:48] layers on top of Bitcoin that are
[20:50] centralized and that are like uh
[20:53] expanding on the Bitcoin value in some
[20:56] sort of form like they are faster they
[20:58] are uh more privacy related whatever
[21:01] they they claim to have uh they can do
[21:05] but the important thing is that we have
[21:06] Bitcoin and everybody can choose to just
[21:08] be on chain and be on the main thing and
[21:12] the second part is that it's audible
[21:15] it's verifiable you don't know how much
[21:18] gold the Federal Reserve really has or
[21:21] had because now they not even like back
[21:24] to it like they completely gave up on
[21:26] that in
[21:27] 1971 uh so but even before you could not
[21:30] audit it because nobody got the gold
[21:33] with Bitcoin it's way easier to audit
[21:35] that you can just give address out you
[21:37] can just provide how many users you have
[21:39] and then you can everybody can match
[21:42] that and it will be really obvious if
[21:44] there is something shitty going on maybe
[21:45] like if it's just like
[21:47] 1% uh or 2% uh of not reserved it's
[21:52] maybe possible for a short amount of
[21:54] time to fool people but not for long uh
[21:57] and not a lot so uh this will be really
[22:00] interesting uh to see how this all will
[22:03] evolve with Bitcoin and all will go on
[22:06] uh with with Bitcoin do you have any
[22:09] additional thoughts on that um yeah I
[22:12] think instead of Bitcoin replacing the
[22:15] central bank I I see it more as Bitcoin
[22:18] replacing what gold was to the central
[22:21] bank
[22:22] right um so
[22:25] yeah yeah actually do it's this more
[22:28] more ACC
[22:29] because but it's kind
[22:31] of it's kind of weird because uh gold is
[22:35] just like the commodity and it didn't
[22:38] did not really had the network aspect
[22:40] because Bitcoin is all like a payment
[22:42] Network where you can transact with it
[22:44] and gold also was this because you can
[22:47] go around and and put it but the Central
[22:50] Bank in the beginning tried to do that
[22:53] with gold like they try to like I have
[22:55] gold and then I can transact with the
[22:58] notes but central banks are like you can
[23:01] make an argument the central banks are
[23:02] like the the layer on top of gold where
[23:05] you have more like a lightning provider
[23:08] like Central central banks are more like
[23:10] even the layer two of of it yeah you're
[23:13] you're right about that actually I do
[23:15] have one more thing to add um and it's
[23:18] the Integrity of of Bitcoin so I feel
[23:21] like we have developers in the space
[23:24] that want to contribute to bitcoin or
[23:27] they want to make Bitcoin more scalable
[23:30] or make it better money because that's
[23:33] what Satoshi put on his white paper
[23:35] peer-to-peer Cash System and I don't
[23:38] think that that's a good approach
[23:41] because Bitcoin is like this miraculous
[23:45] conception that will probably never
[23:48] happen again
[23:50] and I feel like developers that want to
[23:53] make more changes to bitcoin so that
[23:55] they can make it better money um or
[23:58] maybe
[23:59] missing some of the risk factors that
[24:02] would be involved with changing the
[24:04] protocol like the ecosystem that's built
[24:07] around Bitcoin that secures Bitcoin um
[24:11] if you change the protocol I fear that
[24:13] maybe the second and third order effects
[24:15] of that change to the protocol even if
[24:18] it is a soft Fork um if it gets adopted
[24:21] by enough computers I feel like I feel
[24:24] like they could create
[24:26] vulnerabilities that could be
[24:29] existential to bitcoin like further down
[24:31] the road um so from my perspective I
[24:35] feel like we need to keep bitcoin's
[24:37] Integrity intact and we need to keep it
[24:40] refrain from changing it um unless
[24:44] obviously if Bitcoin is truly like in
[24:48] danger of failing then that
[24:52] would that would constitute a change but
[24:56] even then we should be really careful
[24:58] about how and when we change it and how
[25:02] it's implemented because this is like
[25:06] the greatest liberating Force to that
[25:08] Humanity's ever seen and we need to be
[25:11] really careful with this
[25:13] technology yeah totally land is it's so
[25:16] fascinating for me uh to to see the
[25:19] implications of of that uh I I always
[25:23] come back to that one question that is
[25:24] not completely clear for me with with
[25:27] Bitcoin and politics because if you see
[25:29] Bitcoin as fundamental layer to our
[25:33] lives because it's money uh it will
[25:37] dramatically um change how we have um we
[25:43] transact with each other that we have
[25:45] stuff uh with each other um what do you
[25:48] think will be like the the implications
[25:52] for for politics the implications for uh
[25:56] the society in in total uh for Bitcoin
[26:00] and uh maybe maybe in another way asked
[26:04] what do you think is wrong now with with
[26:06] politics and how can how can Bitcoin fix
[26:09] that this this gets like kind of into
[26:12] like the game theory a little bit it's
[26:15] some interesting stuff um and right now
[26:17] I'm reading uh the sovereign individual
[26:21] which is which is kind of changing my
[26:23] perspective a little bit but um like
[26:26] governments today
[26:29] that have control over their
[26:32] Fiat and that get funded by their
[26:36] Central Bank pretty
[26:39] much unlimited to the amount of control
[26:43] or the amount of the amount of funding
[26:46] that they can have to implement that
[26:49] control
[26:50] or the amount of funding that they have
[26:55] to take action I guess but in a world
[26:59] where governments can no longer fund
[27:03] themselves with an unlimited money
[27:05] printer I see um a lot of more a lot
[27:09] more accountability for um Nations
[27:13] governments around the world and
[27:16] governments won't necessarily be able to
[27:18] fund all of the things that they're
[27:20] funding today um so I think government
[27:24] uh evolves to become more of
[27:29] like a service being provided to
[27:31] customers Bitcoin allows everybody to
[27:34] really vote with their feet and
[27:37] whichever government is providing the
[27:39] Superior Service just like the free
[27:42] market will attract the most um the most
[27:46] wealth and the most people that are
[27:48] willing to produce and I feel
[27:51] like at that point um especially if we
[27:54] have um if we have a way where
[27:58] transactions can be private um like in
[28:01] one of those layers that's on top of
[28:04] Bitcoin in terms of the amount of tax
[28:08] that governments can now collect is also
[28:11] is also in question because if they
[28:13] don't know anything about any of your
[28:14] finances then how can they impose any
[28:18] sort of rules that require you to pay a
[28:20] tax on the money that they don't know
[28:22] you have so I think it will enforce some
[28:26] accountability with governments and
[28:28] the rules and regulations that they want
[28:31] to impose on their people and whether
[28:33] they are extracting or attempting to
[28:35] extract wealth from their people I think
[28:39] um people will go to the the Nations
[28:41] that can provide the superior service
[28:43] and then at that point you're paying
[28:45] governments for protection and if a
[28:49] government is providing protection then
[28:51] you are incentivized to pay your taxes
[28:55] so that you can maintain being protected
[28:58] I
[28:59] mean yeah I hear this all the time with
[29:01] bitcoiners and I'm totally agreed with
[29:03] that that governments are like a service
[29:06] provider for you uh we kind of went off
[29:09] the track with with with um with the
[29:12] politics because
[29:14] um politics I think for me is like an an
[29:18] service to their citizens uh and it
[29:22] seems like now it's the other way around
[29:24] where the citizens are service to the
[29:26] governments they're like we have to do
[29:28] what they were doing there full control
[29:31] there's full monitoring going on me
[29:34] depends on where you live it's it's
[29:36] better or worse uh uh your
[29:39] situation uh but it it kind of was is
[29:42] now the other way around where I'm like
[29:45] it actually should be I'm paying the
[29:47] government so they should be on my
[29:50] service and they should have also things
[29:53] that they are competing with and
[29:56] privatization is always is something I'm
[30:00] voting for is like always let's keep it
[30:02] private because then there is more
[30:04] efficiency then there's free market and
[30:06] some someone will compete for that
[30:09] dollar for that Bitcoin for that Satoshi
[30:12] uh if there's no competition no one has
[30:14] the incentive to do a good job I see it
[30:17] all the time when I'm interacting with
[30:20] the government it's
[30:22] inefficient it's it's clunky the
[30:24] software is not good even if they are
[30:25] digitalizing something it's it's it's
[30:28] weirdly not doing good and then we come
[30:30] to an interesting topic uh with with uh
[30:34] um uh cbdcs because a great argument I
[30:38] heard against cbdcs uh from someone was
[30:41] like they cannot Implement that because
[30:44] they cannot Implement any
[30:47] software to do that I don't know if if
[30:50] this is actually true I think they can
[30:51] adopt something I also got an
[30:53] interesting comment yesterday they're
[30:55] like oh why are you for bitco
[30:58] because do Bitcoin is bitting is Bitcoin
[31:01] sitting in a room with the IMF ex a Bas
[31:04] and Ripp is and I'm like this is a good
[31:07] thing for
[31:09] Bitcoin I would not build on that that
[31:13] Ripple is sitting in the room with IMF
[31:15] this is actually a bad thing for ripple
[31:17] it's kind of showing that it's uh not
[31:19] not the um having its
[31:23] purpose that how do you see uh um the
[31:27] the the whole thing with with um oh made
[31:30] that's an interesting thing um the
[31:32] Bitcoin ETFs uh are now coming and
[31:35] they're bringing a lot of buying power
[31:38] in the system and for me it's the
[31:41] question and we were before like in the
[31:44] 2021 uh cycle in 2020 and 2021 cycle
[31:48] this was always a talk is could this be
[31:50] the super cycle and now the talk so
[31:52] coming back up uh is is that cycle now a
[31:56] super cycle where is four years cycle
[31:58] maybe is be broken um do you have any
[32:01] thoughts on that is can be binf and
[32:05] Trigger for super cycle yeah I mean I
[32:07] would love for that to happen for one
[32:09] but the amount of buying power that's
[32:12] coming in from the ETFs is insane like
[32:16] it it's blowing my mind what's happening
[32:19] like this past week um and probably this
[32:22] next week will be some pretty crazy
[32:24] moves like I think we had the largest
[32:28] monthly candle in Bitcoin February so
[32:31] that's that's directly tied to the ETFs
[32:35] and I
[32:37] mean well I scrolling through Twitter
[32:40] and what people are saying about the OTC
[32:42] desks and then the miners that want to
[32:45] hold their bags too as they prepare for
[32:48] the the run and they have their rigs
[32:50] ready um I just think if bitcoin's gone
[32:54] and these ETFs are coming in with more
[32:57] money than they've ever had for Bitcoin
[33:00] and the Bitcoin are already gone and
[33:02] we've only had the ETFs for a month or
[33:05] two um yeah the potential for a super
[33:08] cycle the potential for a million dollar
[33:11] Bitcoin by
[33:12] 2026 like it's it's on the table
[33:17] so I mean yeah and if if that happens
[33:21] and then the ETFs and institutions are
[33:24] now like fooing in at a million doll
[33:27] Bitcoin
[33:28] like I don't know I don't know when um
[33:32] the four-year cycle the downturn would
[33:35] come if there's still no Bitcoin left
[33:37] for sale and there's um institutions and
[33:41] potentially nation states all jumping in
[33:44] to try and get the Bitcoin that's
[33:45] already gone so maybe yeah it will be an
[33:49] interesting experiment to see uh so many
[33:51] more people want Bitcoin and there's
[33:53] less and less available new Supply uh is
[33:56] having uh with in in April I guess 20th
[34:00] or something like this would be would be
[34:03] nice nice nice date for that uh for
[34:06] coming closer to the end I have some
[34:08] interesting questions for you um that
[34:11] I'm think a lot about what do you think
[34:13] Bitcoin will fix that probably nobody
[34:16] thinks about right now because uh I
[34:19] think we really really early in Bitcoin
[34:21] and I always compareed a little bit also
[34:23] to the internet adoption when we are
[34:25] like in the 1995 1994 1997 wherever we
[34:29] are right now with the Bitcoin adoption
[34:31] and there is no iPhone now there is no
[34:34] uh Facebook there is no YouTube there
[34:36] there the killer applications and the
[34:38] really big steps as just getting into
[34:43] Bitcoin in like 5 years in 10 years and
[34:46] there are so many Innovation that needs
[34:48] to happen on top of Bitcoin or that will
[34:51] happen on top of Bitcoin uh and we have
[34:54] to be aware that we are really really
[34:55] early um what do you think think Bitcoin
[34:58] will fix uh that nobody is thinking
[35:01] about right now I would say enacting a
[35:05] global
[35:07] economy to where you can basically get
[35:10] the whole world interacting on a medium
[35:14] where where we can all basically yeah
[35:18] interact in a in a manner that we never
[35:20] have been able to do before and I think
[35:24] that could
[35:26] generate prosperity for Humanity that
[35:29] Humanity's never even thought to be
[35:32] achievable
[35:33] so I think yeah just being able to
[35:38] connect adversaries connect people
[35:41] around the globe because being able to
[35:44] just click of a button be able to send
[35:47] money across the globe instantly will be
[35:50] something that we've never had before so
[35:53] yeah I would say I would say the
[35:55] prosperity that it can create for
[35:59] everybody oh amazing yeah this is uh I
[36:02] think a lot about that and it's I think
[36:04] very true what you're saying um for
[36:07] people that uh uh like when you meet
[36:10] someone that is completely new uh what
[36:12] are your like goto orange pilling
[36:14] packages like your books your podcasts
[36:16] your articles uh what do you usually
[36:19] recommend people getting into uh and and
[36:21] reading I saw I think on your podcast uh
[36:25] that there's like a Bitcoin standard on
[36:27] on the on the Shelf so like what are
[36:30] your like goto articles books podcasts
[36:33] whatever you recommend people going
[36:35] getting into um yeah definitely Fiat or
[36:37] or Bitcoin standard I think that's just
[36:40] like the best way for a beginner to get
[36:43] in because that's how I like my first
[36:45] book into Bitcoin was probably the
[36:47] Bitcoin standard um gradually then
[36:50] suddenly Parker Lewis I think that's got
[36:54] a more comprehensive like this is Fiat
[36:58] money and this is Bitcoin this is why
[37:00] it's way better podcast yeah Robert
[37:03] breed love what is money
[37:05] show um I've I've been binging that for
[37:10] years uh Michael sailor anything that he
[37:13] says pretty
[37:15] much did you speech on on the Bitcoin
[37:19] Atlantis I don't think I got to listen
[37:21] to it yet yeah I I also did not got to I
[37:24] only saw Snippets till now but it was
[37:27] pretty
[37:28] uh amazing what I
[37:29] heard but like always yeah cool um we
[37:34] having an end routine in the podcast
[37:36] where uh the previous guest is asking a
[37:38] question for uh the next guest uh and is
[37:42] bringing like in a question that is not
[37:45] suited for you it's like U something
[37:47] that he does not know you and he just
[37:50] ask a question for the next guest
[37:51] without knowing you uh that's an
[37:53] interesting one I never thought of
[37:55] questioning uh asking that myself self
[37:58] uh what could be the strongest change uh
[38:01] you as Mato uh bring into Bitcoin what
[38:05] can you do to improve Bitcoin I think we
[38:08] we touched on that with the private
[38:10] issuing and what you're doing but what
[38:12] do you think is that yeah um I would say
[38:16] getting Bitcoin into as many hands as
[38:18] possible that's the most important thing
[38:20] that we have to do right MH educating
[38:24] people on
[38:25] bitcoin perfect thank you it was a
[38:27] pleasure to have you on uh it was a nice
[38:29] conversation I think and uh yeah um
[38:31] where can people get in touch with you
[38:33] the best where can people find something
[38:35] about you yeah Twitter just my name
[38:38] Matteo D Dominico um and then I also
[38:41] have a podcast uh Bitcoin profits and
[38:45] I'm G to start making more episodes I
[38:47] I've taken about a few months off since
[38:49] I've working on a project but I'm
[38:52] looking to start making some more um
[38:54] podcast episodes as the price runs up
[38:56] and everybody gets excited and like I
[38:59] see Benjamin Cohen's got his his uh
[39:02] social risk um indicator which shows how
[39:06] many people are coming to YouTube and
[39:08] looking up Bitcoin and and subscribers
[39:11] being added to bitcoin podcasts so yeah
[39:13] I applaud you too for um getting your
[39:16] podcast going I think you're doing some
[39:17] great stuff I think I saw on Twitter
[39:20] your your goal is to interview 300
[39:24] bitcoiners this year so I'm I'm glad I
[39:26] can be a part of that super cool yeah
[39:29] I'm I'm trying to get there like uh
[39:31] March and February I had every day like
[39:34] March I will get every day to a podcast
[39:37] and February I had already every day a
[39:39] podcast uh sometimes even two so I'm on
[39:42] a good way to do that uh the only
[39:44] bottleneck is now publishing the podcast
[39:47] and getting it out I'm only doing five
[39:49] per week like only and yeah it's like
[39:51] it's crazy the interest is really really
[39:53] high since January like I started this
[39:55] year with like 200 and now I think I had
[39:59] 99 uh 999 before the podcast probably
[40:03] have like now actually reached theous
[40:06] mark one record uh and yeah I'm looking
[40:09] forward to see also your podcast getting
[40:11] back up because I saw one episode the
[40:13] last one the it's inable uh Bitcoin I
[40:17] think the fifth it was uh and I saw it's
[40:20] like six months back so it's it's it's
[40:22] nice to to to have you back in the in
[40:24] the Bitcoin podcast game uh I enjoy
[40:27] enjoyed the conversation with the the
[40:29] three of you really really cool um
[40:31] perfect then uh thank you for being on
[40:34] thank you for taking your time witho and
[40:36] I'm I'm hoping to see your podcast again
