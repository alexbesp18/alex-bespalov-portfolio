[00:00] cbcs are the biggest threat to to civil
[00:02] liberty there will be severe limitations
[00:05] on how you could spend the cash in your
[00:07] wallet it's almost a miracle that was
[00:09] created by zosi Nakamoto 99% of all
[00:12] Euros existing are digital today the ECB
[00:16] really steams ahead wants to implement
[00:18] that wants to implement it fast do you
[00:20] really want government to know how much
[00:22] alcohol you buy how many cigarettes how
[00:24] many speeding tickets you get which
[00:26] political party you donate to which
[00:29] religious group you donate money to
[00:31] whether you have an IL legitimate child
[00:33] you need to support cbdcs are fat
[00:36] currencies on
[00:38] [Music]
[00:41] steroids today I want to really focus on
[00:43] on cbdcs more than than Bitcoin maybe
[00:46] lay down a little bit about Bitcoin also
[00:48] um but I think most people are not aware
[00:51] how bad cbdcs actually are um but first
[00:55] let's start with like what are cbdcs and
[00:58] why are you so passionate about it
[01:01] so what are cbdcs
[01:03] cbdcs um is a a new form of money that
[01:07] central banks want want to issue and um
[01:11] there the debate already starts is it
[01:13] really a new type of money because it's
[01:16] essentially an account that you hold
[01:19] with the central bank and you will hold
[01:22] money with the central bank and this
[01:24] money will be digitally transferred then
[01:28] uh between you and other participants in
[01:30] the economy so the the thing that
[01:33] changes is that you don't have the the
[01:35] network of Banks and you directly have a
[01:37] bank account with the ECP if you're in
[01:39] Europe or Federal Reserve if you're in
[01:41] America exactly so you would hold your
[01:44] money with the ECB in the Euro Zone with
[01:48] the with the Federal Reserve in the US
[01:51] correct what are the implications of
[01:54] that like what what what is uh then
[01:56] happening so um you need to look at it
[02:00] at two stages now the first stage will
[02:02] be um that this is an additional type of
[02:06] money that will be issued but in the
[02:09] second stage and there's no doubt about
[02:11] it it will replace the current cash that
[02:14] we know so um you will no longer hold
[02:18] your Euro bills Euro notes in your
[02:20] wallet and no longer the the the dollar
[02:23] bills but you will have credits with
[02:26] central banks interesting yeah it's it's
[02:28] uh it's fascinating for me because then
[02:30] they have way more possibilities to
[02:33] directly manipulate the the supply have
[02:36] more control over it um is it then also
[02:40] cbdcs for you then they're also
[02:42] programmable so they're like oh if if
[02:44] you having an phone and you're in that
[02:46] region you can only spend that much like
[02:48] is is that thing actually happening
[02:50] where you see like they have spending
[02:52] limits and all those things so so when
[02:55] you think of it um you have no longer
[02:58] your your notes and your wallet um but
[03:01] you want to transact with someone so uh
[03:03] you want to give a note to someone else
[03:06] um to a vendor down the street or to
[03:08] your friend you can no longer do so
[03:11] directly but you need to go via a
[03:13] middleman and the middleman is called
[03:15] Central Bank and the Central Bank um Can
[03:20] censor this piece of transaction um I
[03:24] would argue even at will but there will
[03:26] be
[03:27] legislation um but the techn techn ology
[03:30] will provide possibilities for all what
[03:33] you said so programmability of the money
[03:36] um and also in terms of um time when you
[03:40] can spend it um a best before date but
[03:44] also uh Geo fencing the usage of money
[03:47] so yes um there will be severe limit
[03:50] limitations on how you could spend the
[03:53] cash in your wallet that's that's
[03:55] frightening in itself um what what do
[03:58] you say is like the current state of of
[04:01] the cbdcs I I know about Nigeria they
[04:04] they tried something but it kind of
[04:05] failed uh with the enar or what it was
[04:09] called um do you know like what what was
[04:13] already tried in the past maybe let's
[04:15] start with that and then we can move on
[04:16] what what's currently happening yes so
[04:19] so now you have um two examples
[04:23] basically the enira and the sand dollar
[04:26] and the Bahamas and the the uptake of
[04:28] those two is not not very well um quite
[04:31] the opposite in in in Nigeria even riots
[04:35] broke up broke off over the introduction
[04:39] of the Ina where you have an example
[04:42] where things are going rather smooth is
[04:45] of course um the digital huan in China
[04:48] which has been rolled out in in several
[04:50] provinces and um working rather smoothly
[04:54] there do you think that that
[04:56] actually for me it's really hard to
[04:58] imagine because uh when when someone
[05:00] says like oh you have that money that
[05:02] already is bad because there's like the
[05:04] basement going on as as we we know with
[05:06] feed but then oh yeah there's also a
[05:08] spending Limit Oh there's also that and
[05:11] that catch like and digital like digital
[05:15] already is our money like the the actual
[05:17] bills that we transact is already a very
[05:19] small part of the all transactions I
[05:22] personally like try to use cash but it's
[05:25] like it's not that easy anymore uh and
[05:28] it's so convenient Al with with Apple
[05:30] pay and with all those things um why
[05:32] would someone choose something that has
[05:35] no advantages and and just brings more
[05:39] more limitations to your
[05:40] money in very simple terms you'll be
[05:43] forced to in very simple terms but you
[05:47] are absolutely right um looking at the
[05:49] Euro zone for instance 99% of all Euros
[05:52] existing are digital today so when the
[05:56] claim is made oh we need to have digital
[05:58] money it's utterly ridiculous because we
[06:01] already have digital money we have it
[06:03] for many years and 99% of the money
[06:07] existing in Euro in the Euro zone is
[06:09] digital why will people use
[06:12] it well the legislation that will be put
[06:16] in place there's already um some some
[06:18] proposals out there um are that the
[06:22] digital Euro will be issued as a
[06:25] mandatory legal tender and now the the
[06:28] word mandatory is very important here so
[06:30] far the euro is legal tender in the Euro
[06:33] Zone but if you as a vendor put out a
[06:36] sign no you're accept accepted I only
[06:40] accept apples you can do so it's your
[06:43] right contractual
[06:44] freedom however with the digital Euro
[06:47] being implemented as mandatory legal
[06:49] tender you will no longer be able to put
[06:52] such a sign out you as a vendor you will
[06:55] be forced to accept it and how it will
[06:58] then trickle down in the economy that we
[07:01] can also talk about but you will be
[07:03] forced to use that money I mean that's
[07:07] uh that's so like right now as a store
[07:09] owner in the Euro Zone you can basically
[07:12] only accept Bitcoin only accept whatever
[07:14] you want to accept and you don't even
[07:16] have to accept Euro this was uh this new
[07:18] for me actually this is again this is
[07:20] something that is happening the The
[07:22] Proposal is out um many people are not
[07:26] aware of this term mandatory legal
[07:28] tender is new not known to many it also
[07:32] has some implications as for instance
[07:34] when you go to to a McDonald's in the
[07:37] Euro Zone you very often see the signs
[07:40] um no 100 or 200 note accepted here or
[07:44] you go to a gas station it says I had
[07:46] that recently in in Germany No €200 Euro
[07:50] note accepted here company sellers
[07:53] reserve the right to not accept legal
[07:56] tender and they can do so with cash they
[07:59] just need to make you aware prior to
[08:01] concluding the deal with the digital
[08:03] Euro they have to accept the the digital
[08:06] Euro let's go into this what you just uh
[08:08] teaser how will this then triggle down
[08:11] in the economy uh and be basically then
[08:14] used by everyone so um now if you
[08:18] imagine it becomes mandatory legal
[08:21] tender um it will be very easy for
[08:25] governments to say okay we have a legal
[08:28] tender we have a mandatory legal tender
[08:31] we also pay our whatever we pay transfer
[08:36] payments in legal tender and more
[08:40] specifically in mandatory legal tender
[08:43] so if you think for instance about
[08:45] Germany with a with with its its budget
[08:49] of of 1 trillion EUR onethird of that is
[08:54] social payments so government the German
[08:56] government could then easily say hey you
[09:00] know what we no longer make you money
[09:03] transfers to your bank account but we'll
[09:06] transfer you the
[09:07] money in digital euros and as its
[09:10] mandatory legal tender well you have to
[09:13] accept it there's no way around it and
[09:16] then then you have all of a sudden a
[09:18] huge chunk of GDP being circulated being
[09:23] paid in digital
[09:26] Euros how close is that like how how
[09:28] close are we talking is that coming in
[09:31] like one two years or like 10 years well
[09:34] there's a good news and the bad news
[09:35] here the the bad news is that the ECB um
[09:39] really um steams ahead wants to
[09:41] implement that wants to implement it
[09:43] fast the good news is we know how bad
[09:47] public institutions are with large scale
[09:51] IT projects so um you know when they say
[09:56] we want to implement it within two years
[09:58] I think that's currently the the plan we
[10:00] can be pretty sure it it will not happen
[10:03] within two years that's true uh they uh
[10:06] they have a long history of implementing
[10:08] things um I just think about the Berlin
[10:12] uh
[10:14] airport exactly that's that's a good
[10:16] example you know all the all the the
[10:18] toll projects with German roads um So
[10:21] within two years or three years what the
[10:24] what the ECB is planning I I don't think
[10:27] that's realistic how will how will is
[10:30] there already a plan how this
[10:32] technically will be implemented are they
[10:33] doing their own blockchain are they
[10:35] doing their own project are using some
[10:38] uh existing
[10:39] infrastructure um no there's there's no
[10:42] there no details out yet how this will
[10:44] be technically implemented but also
[10:48] um that means not having details out yet
[10:52] means also we don't we were never told
[10:55] it will be a permissionless public
[10:59] blockchain or or um a network of those
[11:03] no it it most likely it won't be
[11:05] otherwise that they would have already
[11:06] announced so we can be pretty sure it
[11:09] will be a a permissioned private
[11:14] blockchain if at all I mean I don't
[11:17] actually even see the need to use a
[11:19] blockchain for that purpose if it's
[11:21] centralized there's no need for a
[11:23] blockchain like honestly like blockchain
[11:25] is such an inefficient way to store data
[11:28] uh except it's decent and you want to
[11:30] have like immutability and all all those
[11:32] things but I I I see no no use as a
[11:36] blockchain for an digital Euro me
[11:39] neither not at all it's better to just
[11:41] store it in a conventional database can
[11:45] we still do do you see a hope uh in the
[11:48] future that we still block this
[11:50] completely or is it more like we should
[11:52] soften the the
[11:54] blow so um can we can we block it um I
[11:58] think I think the US has delivered an
[12:01] example um that um it can be at least
[12:04] put on it can be put on hold um the the
[12:07] Congress has has voted against cbdcs in
[12:10] the US um which which I find remarkable
[12:13] and which is actually a role model for
[12:15] all those in Europe who say well we have
[12:18] to accept it no not really um you know
[12:22] maybe contact your representative in
[12:24] Parliament and and tell them I don't
[12:26] want it it's I also heard that like
[12:28] America is the great example then we
[12:30] have China on the other hand that is a a
[12:33] bad example but then there's also Canada
[12:36] which I heard they doing also something
[12:38] with Social Security and binding it to
[12:40] the the money uh and I heard this like a
[12:43] small note like a few months back I
[12:45] don't know if they actually do it um but
[12:48] is it is like we have the Federal
[12:50] Reserve we have America now we have
[12:53] China and we have Europe is there
[12:54] something else going on maybe in Canada
[12:56] Australia do you know about projects
[12:58] outside of those regions um so basically
[13:01] there's there's um there's research
[13:04] going on in in very many countries I
[13:06] mean there I think above 90% of all
[13:08] central banks pursue now uh um digital
[13:14] currency projects um some do just on
[13:18] wholesale level some some go further
[13:20] down on retail level um there are some
[13:23] um banks that that are further ahead
[13:25] than others um I don't know any specific
[13:29] spefically about the the Canadian
[13:30] Central Bank for instance um but I know
[13:33] that there is a pretty positive stance
[13:36] currently of the Canadian Central Bank
[13:37] towards cbdcs um but it remains to be
[13:41] seen it remains to be seen I think it
[13:43] also will depend a lot um on the
[13:46] political landscape so in Canada for
[13:48] instance the the um head of the the
[13:51] opposition party has a strong stance
[13:55] against cbdc so I think it it could
[13:59] change with the next election or yeah
[14:01] let's see I think they have I think next
[14:03] year is the election in Canada if I'm
[14:05] confirmed informed correctly but it's
[14:07] it's it's not that uh wide out um maybe
[14:11] let's let's paint a little bit of a
[14:13] picture um because yeah it's digital oh
[14:17] yeah it's it's a little bit differently
[14:19] um but what what will um if if we now
[14:23] think of there's no Bitcoin there's no
[14:25] cash there's no alternative payment
[14:28] system alternative uh asset in in that
[14:31] regard everything is kind of feat
[14:32] denominated and we have that Fiat
[14:36] cbdc digital Euro Digital Federal
[14:39] Reserve nodes uh as a future um what
[14:43] will that world look like what's what's
[14:46] possible uh and and what can can you
[14:49] paint us a picture of that world so so
[14:52] um painting your picture of a world um
[14:55] with without Bitcoin so Bitcoin being
[14:57] banned and basically basically what is
[14:59] left are cbdcs
[15:01] so yes I I can paint you that picture of
[15:04] a world with only
[15:07] cbdcs um it will be a world where
[15:11] alternative means of payment spring up
[15:14] and why I say that is pretty simple
[15:16] because we had that already in history
[15:18] so we had the entire Eastern block where
[15:21] you had currencies that were worthless
[15:24] but officially used so you would get
[15:26] your salary in those currencies polish
[15:29] slotty um East German Mark and so on um
[15:33] you would get your official salaries you
[15:35] pay your rent you pay your um food with
[15:39] it all those prices were not market
[15:42] prices but fantasy prices made up by
[15:47] government and otherwise you could use
[15:49] the money for nothing so the official
[15:51] money was essentially worthless and then
[15:54] you had alternative monies for which you
[15:57] could get anything at any time so those
[16:01] werein the Western currencies so with
[16:04] the US dollar um you could essentially
[16:07] get in Poland whatever you wanted at any
[16:10] time so it will be a world of official
[16:14] currencies cbdcs and inofficial
[16:17] currencies and there we still need to
[16:19] see what it is it could for instance be
[16:23] precious metals just just an idea it
[16:26] could also be um other the digital
[16:29] currencies private currencies which are
[16:33] virtually impossible to ban such as
[16:36] Bitcoin but it remains to be seen it
[16:38] will be a world however of official
[16:41] currencies that are worthless that can
[16:43] buy you nothing you know go to a shop
[16:46] find empty shelves there you can buy um
[16:49] Goods with the official currency and
[16:52] you'll find black markets where you can
[16:54] get anything anytime with inofficial
[16:56] money man so when we speed up that
[16:59] process and thought a little bit more do
[17:02] you think that a cbdc because it's even
[17:05] worse than the money that we have right
[17:07] now could actually then speed up the
[17:09] adoption of the alternative assets like
[17:13] gold Bitcoin and so on absolutely so um
[17:17] the cbdc cbdcs will be worse than our
[17:21] current money um cbdcs are fat money on
[17:25] steroids you know um because you don't
[17:28] don't even need paper or cotton or and
[17:32] ink to produce them you simply mint by
[17:35] pressing a button so um you can you can
[17:39] increase you can increase the the money
[17:41] flow at will um and thus it will be
[17:45] worse than our current um money and it
[17:49] will spur other monies to become more um
[17:55] prominent absolutely so yes I I see in
[17:58] that sense I see as a catalyst for other
[18:01] monies alternative assets yes that's
[18:04] really interesting um when we look now
[18:07] on an individual level how should we
[18:11] like first of all like your thing is
[18:13] like let's call your local politicians
[18:15] let say like oh we don't want cbdcs
[18:17] please don't vote for cddcs local
[18:19] politicians that's like something
[18:21] everyone can do uh to try to soften it
[18:24] or block it or whatever so that maybe we
[18:26] come to a state where the EU is doing
[18:28] something similar than America is doing
[18:30] right now uh but on another note how can
[18:34] we protect each other from so um how can
[18:38] we um how can we postpone it first of
[18:42] all I mean by for instance by using cash
[18:45] Etc um when it then happens again I
[18:48] think the best strategies are to be to
[18:51] be in real assets as as cbdcs are fat
[18:55] currencies on steroids um your real acid
[18:58] will not be inflated away so be in real
[19:02] assets and another um way of of
[19:06] protecting yourself from cbdcs some
[19:09] people claim is shielding your privacy
[19:13] because that's another topic we haven't
[19:15] talked about in detail yet but shielding
[19:18] your privacy by the means of a an a
[19:22] legal entity that you put around you so
[19:24] um basically using coroporation
[19:29] shell as the one that holds cbdcs and
[19:32] spends
[19:33] cbdcs um so that at least government
[19:36] can't intrude on your privacy yeah
[19:38] that's a whole another topic with cbdcs
[19:40] rather privacy it's it's like then they
[19:43] have a complete database of everyone
[19:46] whatever they spend and they can request
[19:49] that like at any point and it's
[19:50] centralized in one uh thing it's also
[19:53] interesting when you talk like it's a
[19:55] big Honeypot like it's uh data from
[19:58] everyone in the world uh in like or
[20:01] everyone in this jurisdiction of what
[20:03] they spend and we know that no system
[20:06] really is safe from hackers especially
[20:08] not things that are made by the
[20:10] government um what does this mean like
[20:13] for like cyber attacks for privacy on
[20:16] cbdcs for the
[20:18] individual so um what it means
[20:22] is central banks uh will essentially
[20:25] create a a data Trove of every
[20:29] transaction a human makes from the first
[20:35] pacifier um you know you get as a baby
[20:38] to basically the coffin you buy at the
[20:40] end of your life so basically a full
[20:44] record of every transaction for a human
[20:47] being and um there are many people who
[20:50] say Okay um I'm I'm a good citizen I
[20:55] don't commit any crimes and I have
[20:57] nothing to fear government should know
[20:58] know everything I I buy but those people
[21:02] I would like to remind do you really
[21:04] want to know how much Al do you really
[21:07] want government to know how much alcohol
[21:10] you buy how many cigarettes um how many
[21:13] speeding tickets you get um which
[21:16] political party you you spend you donate
[21:20] to um which religious group you donate
[21:24] money to um um whether you have an
[21:28] illegitimate
[21:29] child you need to support and so on and
[21:33] so forth so you can be a perfectly good
[21:36] citizen and still want to make
[21:38] transaction that government doesn't know
[21:42] whether you go to a psychiatrist for
[21:44] instance or psychologist you know all
[21:46] these things which lawyers you pay you
[21:49] may not want government to know and it's
[21:51] your right that government doesn't know
[21:53] but it will be in this big data set that
[21:57] government can collect on you and and
[22:01] that's that's the big privacy issue that
[22:03] we have with if you watch or listen to
[22:06] my podcast on a regular basis I guess
[22:08] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[22:11] the most important step is to keep the
[22:14] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[22:16] wallet my personal recommendation for
[22:18] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[22:21] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[22:23] perfect gift for a friend who has still

[23:37] saying oh no but I don't do anything
[23:39] wrong and I'm like oh but maybe there
[23:41] will one day come a government that in
[23:44] their eyes you're doing something wrong
[23:46] even though ethically you're not doing
[23:47] something wrong so like uh that's that's
[23:50] interesting for me yeah so so I mean you
[23:52] rais a very good point there um that is
[23:55] that is a very um important principle in
[23:58] in in philosophy when you consider um
[24:01] decisions you know it's called the veil
[24:03] of ignorance you don't know what is
[24:05] behind the veil and therefore you should
[24:07] consider um positive and negative
[24:10] outcomes now you may think today what I
[24:14] do today is perfectly
[24:16] legitimate tomorrow there may be a
[24:18] different government in place that
[24:21] revalues your decisions today so could
[24:25] be that you donate to a party today and
[24:28] think think it's POS perfectly
[24:29] legitimate today comes a new government
[24:32] in tomorrow and you may not be um
[24:35] qualified for certain jobs with
[24:37] government anymore you maybe you get
[24:39] kicked out as a civil servant because 10
[24:42] years ago you donated to the wrong party
[24:45] so when you think hey it's okay
[24:48] today also consider what could happen
[24:51] tomorrow what could happen under totally
[24:54] different circumstances you know under
[24:57] the worst Poss
[24:59] government so to say yeah and it's
[25:01] that's what that that's the point I
[25:03] always try to make with cbdcs is like we
[25:06] are installing a tool which is highly
[25:08] dangerous and is controlling monitoring
[25:10] all Financial transactions and even if
[25:13] we assume
[25:14] everyone uh has their best intentions at
[25:18] heart and is a great human being
[25:20] involved in those projects what if
[25:22] there's one day in like 30 years someone
[25:25] coming that doesn't do does that like
[25:28] it's just like a centralized tool which
[25:31] is really um powerful that can be um
[25:37] they can be misused by someone it's just
[25:39] a matter of time till this first till a
[25:42] person comes that misuses it in let's
[25:45] say like that you pretty much nailed it
[25:47] yes so it is a tool and even if the
[25:50] people today have have the best
[25:52] intentions at heart it could be abused
[25:55] in the future in in most terrible ways
[25:59] so in in such terrible ways that my
[26:02] claim is cbc's are the biggest threat to
[26:05] to civil
[26:07] liberties that we Face In Our Lifetime
[26:11] and potentially in future lifetime so
[26:13] think also what you want to leave behind
[26:15] to your children grandchildren
[26:17] whatsoever should should we move uh or
[26:21] like when should we move out of the EU
[26:23] and go to another place where there are
[26:25] no cbcs maybe America goes down the road
[26:28] where there absolutely no cbdcs maybe
[26:30] even Donald Trump announces some
[26:32] strategic reserve and the Bitcoin prag
[26:34] in like one day or something like that
[26:37] is there a point where you would say
[26:38] like oh now I actually have to move out
[26:40] that's that's a very good question maybe
[26:42] you're asking the wrong person because I
[26:45] I live in Switzerland and and
[26:46] Switzerland has no intention of
[26:49] introducing retail cbdcs so um for now I
[26:53] feel pretty safe here you know and and
[26:56] um I I recently spoke to a former um
[27:00] member of the Swiss Parliament and he
[27:02] said to me you know if if they were to
[27:05] introduce retail cbdcs in Switzerland we
[27:09] would have riots we would have a civil
[27:13] war on our hands so this is why I
[27:17] believe in Switzerland we are fairly
[27:19] safe from cbdcs from retail cbdcs let's
[27:22] put that way it's for me it's
[27:24] interesting because I'm from Austria and
[27:26] for me it's like Switzerland is like
[27:29] Austria plus there's no
[27:32] EU you know that's that's why why we
[27:35] have the Plus on our
[27:38] passports interesting uh but would you
[27:42] recommend to someone that lives in the
[27:44] EU like me uh to move just a few
[27:48] kilometers uh to the uh yeah to the West
[27:52] uh to
[27:53] Switzerland um it depends on on on on
[27:58] the person I'm talking to so I mean
[28:00] there there will be enough people who
[28:02] don't care there will be also enough
[28:04] people um who don't um who are not
[28:06] affected by it you know maybe they don't
[28:09] don't change their lifestyle at all
[28:11] under a cbdc regime and maybe they also
[28:14] um don't mind if government have all all
[28:17] their transactional data um however um
[28:23] if if I talk to people like you I guess
[28:26] I would recommend yes if retail cbdcs
[28:30] are introduced um as as the sole means
[28:36] of payment of of legal tender of a state
[28:39] of a country I would move out I guess
[28:42] that's that would be then the last uh
[28:47] that would be the straw that that breaks
[28:48] the camels back basically yes are you
[28:51] also um are you originally from from
[28:54] Germany if I'm allowed to ask so yes
[28:57] originally I was was born in Germany I I
[28:59] moved to Switzerland about 20 years ago
[29:01] yes why was that the decision is it was
[29:04] just professionally or was it there also
[29:05] intentionally outside of you no that was
[29:08] for love I met my my wife and uh we
[29:12] moved together oh that's that's the best
[29:14] reason to move I guess
[29:17] absolutely um now let's come to to the
[29:20] Bitcoin topics I'm really curious also
[29:22] what uh as someone who's really opposed
[29:24] to cbdcs uh what's your thoughts on on
[29:27] bitcoin uh
[29:28] so my thought on bitcoin is that it's a
[29:32] it's a first of all brilliant
[29:36] technological uh feat that we have here
[29:39] I mean you see the I have a a model of a
[29:43] of a blockchain on my shelf uh that that
[29:46] I use I buil it from Lego of my children
[29:49] that I use to explain the blockchain to
[29:52] my students and um I think
[29:55] technologically it's almost a miracle
[29:58] that was created by
[30:00] uh satosi Nakamoto um
[30:05] and its social implications are are also
[30:09] vast I mean um we have the Austrian
[30:12] School of Economics um most notably
[30:15] Hayek who in the 70s published a book
[30:17] about the denationalization of money and
[30:20] we see that becoming reality with
[30:23] Bitcoin so from a technological also
[30:27] sociological IC um point of view I think
[30:30] it's an absolute
[30:31] outstanding uh invention there that we
[30:34] have is there a chance that we live in
[30:37] maybe 20 30 years on a on a Bitcoin
[30:39] standard without those I think there is
[30:42] there is a chance that is bigger zero
[30:45] yes I I think that um there is a chance
[30:48] I still Advocate um a competition among
[30:53] monies you know like like Hayek did so
[30:58] um if there are different um monies out
[31:02] there um privately issued and
[31:05] governmental issued they comp should
[31:07] compete for quality and then have people
[31:10] decide which which money they want to
[31:13] transact in and therefore I think
[31:16] Bitcoin would be in a in a good position
[31:18] of course they we need to see the
[31:21] technological upgrades and so on make it
[31:24] quantum proof and so on but yes they why
[31:27] not
[31:28] it's also interesting because it goes
[31:30] into the similar Direction what um
[31:33] chavier m is saying in Argentina he just
[31:36] wants to have a free competition of all
[31:38] currencies in Argentina and wants to
[31:40] demolish the the central banks I did not
[31:42] follow up what he actually did in the
[31:45] last few couple months since he's
[31:48] elected um is is the the the thing that
[31:52] Javier m in Argentina is doing kind of
[31:55] the the the best way to go ahead and see
[31:58] like oh let's let's just enable free
[32:00] competition in our
[32:02] country um so I I think the the empirics
[32:07] they they prove that he is is pretty
[32:09] right on his course what he's doing um
[32:12] he got to my knowledge he got Argentina
[32:14] out of out of recession um that's
[32:18] astounding um
[32:20] and the the well the currency issue I
[32:24] think he um he still needs to in the
[32:28] long run you know he still needs to fix
[32:30] that that issue and see which currency
[32:34] would be best suited but um taking his
[32:39] taking his Free Will um I could imagine
[32:42] that he will have um different
[32:45] currencies circulating in Argentina
[32:48] really cool what's your thoughts on on
[32:49] El Salvador I mean they were not not as
[32:52] with Argentina they really tried to get
[32:55] Bitcoin in the country like the the the
[32:57] president is is buying Bitcoin he's
[32:59] advocating for Bitcoin he's really
[33:01] trying also to get Bitcoin El and
[33:03] Bitcoin companies in the in the country
[33:05] which is an interesting move so he's
[33:07] he's less like oh free uh Market let's
[33:11] have all the currencies competing he's
[33:13] more like oh I think Bitcoin is the best
[33:15] thing and let's let's have Bitcoin in
[33:16] the country what what is what's that
[33:18] move so um to be honest I I don't know
[33:22] how um how successful that will be in
[33:25] the long run however um what I totally
[33:29] um admire is that that he took this bold
[33:32] move and we need people um trying out
[33:36] alternative ways so I think we know
[33:41] that Fiat currencies in the long run
[33:44] don't
[33:45] work it's it's just a matter of fact
[33:47] having people who try alternative paths
[33:51] um that can serve as role model for
[33:53] others in other countries that's
[33:56] fantastic that is that is very very
[33:59] brave to do and um in his case I'm I'm
[34:02] thankful that we have basically this
[34:04] example that we can in the long run
[34:06] compared to other countries fantastic
[34:09] fantastic that he did so and it's really
[34:12] cool to see as Salvador because it's
[34:14] like in in 10 years time we like right
[34:16] now I think it's such a bold move that
[34:19] we can not even really measure if it's
[34:21] was successful yes we know Murder it is
[34:23] down but that's not because of Bitcoin
[34:25] we know tourism is up because yeah a lot
[34:27] of people are are curious now about El
[34:28] Salvador way more people speaking about
[34:30] it uh but if it's actually successful I
[34:32] guess we we at least have to wait
[34:34] another eight to 10 years to really um
[34:37] judge that uh if if it was like that it
[34:40] would be interesting because I also made
[34:41] a lot of interviews already with people
[34:44] that move back to El Salvador because of
[34:46] nuk or are now moving to El Salvador
[34:49] because of him uh will be really
[34:51] interesting to go back to those
[34:52] interviews and see in 10 years how how
[34:54] this actually developed and how it
[34:56] actually uh turned out I myself probably
[34:59] will visit in November I was never there
[35:02] I really want to see how far the Bitcoin
[35:05] adoption is going how how seemingless uh
[35:08] everything is is doing a big fan of like
[35:10] actually trying the thing on the ground
[35:13] and and seeing how it goes you were
[35:14] never in Salvador unfortunately I
[35:16] haven't I haven't visited it I I also I
[35:19] would like to go there um I don't know
[35:22] when I'll be able to um what is what is
[35:25] so important also just from a scientific
[35:28] point of view is to have basically this
[35:31] this comparison case this comparison
[35:33] case um unfortunately we don't have a
[35:35] comparison group you know that would be
[35:37] fantastic we would have several
[35:38] countries um doing this alternative way
[35:41] and then having another 200 who go the
[35:44] Fiat way but to see then to compare it
[35:48] in detail what works and doesn't work
[35:50] and I'm thankful that this case study
[35:55] exists yeah and so earlier it was
[35:57] definitely a surprise for me that so
[35:59] early in the Bitcoin history we have
[36:01] this especially when we look at history
[36:02] of money usually takes a long time um I
[36:06] got yesterday a comment and I get this
[36:09] comment I think once a month at least uh
[36:12] and the profer picture was like and the
[36:14] Fed so and the Central Bank in in
[36:16] America and the comment was interesting
[36:18] because I guess he gets the problem uh
[36:21] but he does not want to see Bitcoin as a
[36:23] solution and the comment was basically
[36:26] uh cbdcs are just training wheels from
[36:29] the government to introduce cbdcs after
[36:32] that so like Bitcoin is like an an a
[36:34] precursor to cbdcs from the government
[36:37] trying them out I hear that uh
[36:40] unfortunately all the time and it's of
[36:43] course those things occur in the
[36:45] internet but why do you is is do you
[36:48] think there's anything to it first of
[36:50] all and and uh do you think and why do
[36:53] you think that that that that thinking
[36:55] is in in in our heads
[36:59] um so so um in other words what you're
[37:01] saying is Bitcoin according to the those
[37:04] commments is a big false flag operation
[37:07] by government to her us into cbdcs yeah
[37:12] exactly um well
[37:15] I that would require such an amount of
[37:20] um three
[37:21] dimensional chess playing you know that
[37:24] over years and years and so so that I
[37:28] doubt that there's any truth to it I
[37:31] mean also if you see if you look at the
[37:34] H history of Bitcoin Bitcoin it was not
[37:37] clear that Bitcoin um would would become
[37:40] the big success that is today I mean I
[37:42] remember back in in the days when when
[37:45] Bitcoin was new there were these Bitcoin
[37:47] faets all over the internet where you
[37:50] where you need to do a capture and you
[37:53] would get Bitcoins for free that was
[37:56] that was just
[37:58] how to how to spread the usage of
[38:01] Bitcoin and um and if that would all be
[38:06] government driven it wouldn't have been
[38:08] on the brink it would there there would
[38:10] the the government would have uh banged
[38:12] the drums for it and so on now this and
[38:15] that over several changes in politics
[38:19] and governments and so on no this I I
[38:23] perfect yeah I just wanted to address
[38:25] this because it's a it's something that
[38:27] comes up since like one year like every
[38:29] month there's a comy like that and I
[38:32] always respond to that but I I wanted to
[38:34] get it once on the video and I F felt
[38:36] like you are the perfect guest to talk
[38:38] about that uh because you are not that
[38:41] usually I've really let's say laser IED
[38:44] Bitcoin Max is on my show let's say
[38:47] let's let's call it like that as as
[38:48] myself uh and and so I wanted to get it
[38:52] with you because you're a little bit
[38:53] different than that you have a little
[38:54] bit more of a scientific um approach to
[38:57] bitcoin coin and I like that a lot and I
[38:59] try to also break out every once in a
[39:01] while a little bit of the bubble I also
[39:02] have people on that just have like a
[39:04] small allocation to bitcoin and have
[39:06] everything else in gold or gold uh
[39:08] related uh Investments uh because I
[39:11] think we can uh really benefit from a
[39:14] broader perspective the only thing that
[39:16] I will not have on is corers that I
[39:19] call them like that um but coming to the
[39:22] tin before the tin there's always one
[39:24] question that I always ask my guests um
[39:27] I always usually ask what can we can
[39:29] learn from you besides Bitcoin but today
[39:31] I will ask you what can we learn from
[39:33] you besides cbdcs and Bitcoin besides
[39:36] cbdcs and Bitcoin
[39:39] um well what you can learn from me is
[39:42] that there there is still a fantastic
[39:45] world out there with with many
[39:47] opportunities and I my field of interest
[39:51] is fintech um and there are tremendous
[39:56] opportunities out there there you can
[39:58] pursue and also with that trying to to
[40:02] make Society a bit better step by step
[40:06] so the entire topic of decentralized
[40:09] Finance I find it fantastic um you can
[40:12] learn about that from me and maybe also
[40:16] work together with me to make it happen
[40:19] and make
[40:21] Society better by actually making the
[40:25] entire Financial system more Dem
[40:28] Democratic maybe one question to to
[40:30] squeeze in here how impactful is money
[40:34] now soci how how how different is a
[40:37] society when the money is different as
[40:40] the Bas layer so if if the money is is
[40:44] totally different as the base layer
[40:46] Society is also totally different there
[40:49] there is this um Soviet um proverb
[40:52] saying
[40:54] they they make us believe that they pay
[40:57] us and we will make them believe that we
[41:00] work for them so in other words if I
[41:04] receive for my work money that is
[41:07] worthless I will also not work and that
[41:10] will lead then to to empty shops empty
[41:14] shelves that will lead to to people
[41:17] refusing to work essentially and um
[41:21] Society will be entirely different yeah
[41:23] and I can we we have so many examples
[41:25] already in history that that prove and
[41:27] show us that and it's it's really cool
[41:29] to
[41:30] see yeah yeah yeah and and also what
[41:33] what I find fascinating at the current
[41:35] moment and going back to cbdc sorry but
[41:38] is that we are running into these
[41:41] massive problems because of uh Central
[41:45] Banking because of too much Central
[41:47] Banking because of too much power in a
[41:49] few hands and now we want to get rid of
[41:53] those problems by concentrating even
[41:56] more more power in even fewer hands and
[42:00] this is not going to work this is not
[42:02] going to work is Central Banking if done
[42:07] right or could Central Banking be done
[42:10] right in a good way where money actually
[42:12] works or will Central Banking always
[42:14] leads to uh more and more inflation more
[42:17] and more control in smaller and smaller
[42:19] hands because you always have to print
[42:20] more when something happens and stuff
[42:22] like that so if you would have a a
[42:24] central bank that is totally independent
[42:27] and if you have the the Prototype of
[42:31] good people governing a central bank um
[42:35] I think central a central banking system
[42:37] could last very long in the very long
[42:40] run I even doubt that such a central
[42:43] banking system would be to the benefit
[42:47] of the people because it's a monopoly
[42:50] it's it's a monopoly and sooner or later
[42:53] the Monopoly will
[42:55] misallocate money
[42:58] and and free market forces could do that
[43:00] better okay now I have I have one more
[43:03] question coming up in my head now sorry
[43:06] um is is is money over the long run
[43:09] there's this like concept of singularity
[43:11] in money that we uh kind of end up with
[43:13] one form of money for society over very
[43:17] long uh time I mean history kind of does
[43:20] not prove that to a certain extent but
[43:22] there are a lot of interesting concepts
[43:24] of like oh in the long run we will end
[43:26] up on on one money H also this how is it
[43:30] called K scale where we move up the type
[43:33] one civilization where we have one type
[43:37] of money that works for the whole planet
[43:40] um do you think we we get there where we
[43:43] kind of end up with with one great money
[43:45] Source could be Bitcoin
[43:48] um I I sort of doubt it to be honest
[43:51] because I believe um also um just by the
[43:55] means of innovation new types of money
[43:58] will come up you know so even if we if
[44:01] we believe in Bitcoin and think Bitcoin
[44:04] is is the greatest existing money
[44:06] currently new monies will come up so I I
[44:11] don't think until the end of humanity
[44:13] Bitcoin will be the one single money um
[44:17] but if you look if you look at um Star
[44:19] Trek and and so on they depict the
[44:21] future basically without money because
[44:23] they will have um endless energy sources
[44:27] and um if you have endless energy
[44:29] sources to cheap energy then
[44:32] basically everyone can fulfill their
[44:34] dreams and no money is needed that that
[44:36] is the way of thinking but um I doubt
[44:40] that one single money um will exist
