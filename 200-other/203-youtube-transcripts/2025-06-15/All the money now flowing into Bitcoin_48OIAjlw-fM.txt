[00:00] it seems like we are in the beginning of
[00:02] an extremely bloody Market with one
[00:05] shining bow Bitcoin is up almost 15% in
[00:09] the last 5 days meanwhile Google is down
[00:12] 6% Tesla is down 6% apple is down 5% the
[00:16] whole s SMP 500 is down
[00:21] 2.39% but not only stocks also real
[00:24] estate is going down a little bit but
[00:26] even other cryptocurrencies against
[00:29] Bitcoin are extremely bad performing
[00:32] let's look at the strongest and biggest
[00:35] cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin
[00:38] ethereum is down against Bitcoin over
[00:42] 30% in one year and just in the last
[00:45] month it was going down 15% of course
[00:49] this is quite new this is quite short
[00:52] term but this could be the starting
[00:54] point of a long-term trend of a
[00:57] long-term Trend that sees Bitcoin as the
[00:59] the quality asset as the sound money as
[01:03] we all know it for and the market is
[01:06] Awakening to that and all the other
[01:08] assets are leaking money directly into
[01:11] the sound money Bitcoin everything that
[01:14] isn't sound money and there's only
[01:16] Bitcoin as sound money is Flowing slowly
[01:19] into Bitcoin and is repricing all the
[01:22] other assets that is a journey that
[01:24] actually started 2009 with the creation
[01:27] or the discovery of Bitcoin and slowly
[01:30] we are seeing this trength but as
[01:33] Bitcoin gets more and more mature we are
[01:35] seeing this in bigger and bigger fashion
[01:38] and more and more people are waking up
[01:41] to this reality so let's make really
[01:44] sure to stack enough Bitcoin bye-bye
