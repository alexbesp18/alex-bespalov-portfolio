[00:00] I went from Bitcoin to Austrian
[00:01] economics and then low time preference
[00:03] and now that changed everything from
[00:05] from sleep exercise and diet Bitcoin is
[00:08] the infinite game it is something that
[00:09] is way way Beyond us it's bigger than us
[00:12] the longer someone holds Bitcoin the
[00:14] more they tend towards getting healthier
[00:17] they tend toward towards more their
[00:19] passion more what they actually want to
[00:21] do and not like I just do that because
[00:23] I'm scared of what might happen if I
[00:25] change anything there's a fundamental
[00:27] issue with our system even if we give it
[00:28] away to somebody for free creating it is
[00:30] not free and executing on that plan is
[00:32] not free there there's no free
[00:34] [Music]
[00:38] lunch you developed a a Bitcoin game and
[00:41] I think uh it would be interesting to to
[00:43] talk about Bitcoin game theory in the
[00:47] starting about that um interesting
[00:51] question is is Bitcoin changing the
[00:54] rules of the game or is Bitcoin a whole
[00:57] new game I well I think it's doing both
[01:00] I I think it's a whole new it is a whole
[01:03] new game and I still think there a lot
[01:06] of people who just don't that just don't
[01:09] understand what's changing yet they
[01:11] don't understand the magnitude of what
[01:12] it is people in the space obviously we
[01:15] sound like we have our lasery cult thing
[01:17] going on and and people are all like
[01:20] yeah yeah yeah but once you see it you
[01:22] can't you can't unsee it but as you
[01:25] introduce that to a world that doesn't
[01:28] understand it they're trying to
[01:30] interpret it through their the lens as
[01:33] the world as as they see it the the lens
[01:35] of the world as they learned it the Fiat
[01:37] world and and so it's it's slowly
[01:41] chipping away and interrupt and
[01:43] disrupting um disrupting Industries
[01:46] disrupting money obviously so it is
[01:48] going to disrupt things um but I do
[01:51] think it's because it's a whole new game
[01:53] and we've they're they're in the same
[01:55] environment we're all humans this is
[01:56] this is we're living and so people have
[01:59] to react to that and initially they're
[02:01] going to react to to it with whatever
[02:04] way that they know whatever way that
[02:05] they see the world until they get to a
[02:08] point where they see something different
[02:09] they open up and then they can join our
[02:13] cult I I love also the the incentives of
[02:16] of that because like if if you're in the
[02:19] the Bitcoin game you have so like your
[02:22] your incentive is so much better than if
[02:24] you playing in in that fear game if we
[02:27] like actually like imagine as like I
[02:29] don't know two two different games going
[02:31] on on a playground and the one game is
[02:33] just so much more fun long term than the
[02:35] other
[02:36] one% um and it it does change in a lot
[02:38] of ways I mean it's it it changes more
[02:40] than in the US a lot of people want to
[02:42] focus on the investment side of it
[02:44] obviously if you're coming at it from a
[02:46] human rights standpoint that's a whole
[02:49] other aspect of it um but it's it's
[02:52] going to disrupt things like the energy
[02:54] industry for example it's going to be
[02:55] completely changed with it and it it's
[02:59] just it's going to take time for
[03:00] different different groups to see it on
[03:02] a personal note I know for me I I went
[03:05] from Bitcoin to Austrian economics and
[03:07] then loow time preference and now that
[03:10] changed everything from from sleep
[03:13] exercise and and diet of course it's
[03:16] disrupting it's disrupting all of those
[03:19] things but maybe not just maybe not like
[03:21] in your face like I just hit you between
[03:22] the face and say Here's a new way of
[03:24] doing money it's it's impacting the way
[03:26] you think and then as you approach food
[03:29] and and and diet and education and all
[03:31] these other areas it it has the
[03:34] secondary tertiary effects so uh in that
[03:38] way it's going to disrupt just about
[03:40] everything how how has Bitcoin impacted
[03:43] uh your life so far so so um let me
[03:47] break that up into a couple couple
[03:49] things on the professional side so I was
[03:51] in the Army for the first five years of
[03:54] my career got out went to business
[03:56] school and that's where I met T and she
[03:59] was going to be investment banker and I
[04:00] was going to be a Management
[04:02] Consultant um 911 happens we start
[04:05] having kids we have four children and we
[04:08] she wants to homeschool so I found
[04:09] myself in an a Fiat operational role or
[04:13] roles and she was at home raising the
[04:16] raising the the kids up until 2022 so in
[04:21] 2022 that's when we decid all the kids
[04:23] were done she had taken the
[04:25] homeschooling thing all the way through
[04:26] the K through 12 equivalent for
[04:28] homeschooling
[04:30] and it was a matter of putting our our
[04:33] money and our time where where our mouth
[04:36] was so we told the kids as they were
[04:37] growing up you could do anything you
[04:38] could be an entrepreneur you can do all
[04:40] the stuff and and I had lost my uh my
[04:43] position was eliminated in the company
[04:45] that I was in I was vice president of
[04:47] logistics and we had to make a choice do
[04:50] we go back to this to these roles that I
[04:53] did not
[04:54] enjoy and go and be at the whim of
[04:56] somebody else or now the kids are done
[04:59] do we make a decision and we do we move
[05:01] forward and be that that expression
[05:03] about be the change that you want in the
[05:05] world do we do we go for it and so it
[05:08] was two years ago that we went full-time
[05:10] on free market kids and that's then now
[05:13] that's branched out
[05:14] into into courses and books and podcasts
[05:19] and other things so that's on the career
[05:21] side it it changed it on the personal
[05:24] side that's also pretty significant
[05:26] because when I was in the Fiat roles I
[05:30] was never doing anything that would that
[05:32] I that I was passionate about I was
[05:34] never never I never felt
[05:37] fulfilled and so going down the
[05:39] entrepreneur path has a lot more
[05:41] volatility a lot more emotional
[05:43] volatility as you're trying to figure
[05:45] out how to to make it as an entrepreneur
[05:48] so stress level in incredibly High High
[05:52] Time preference stress just through the
[05:54] roof on the other hand I have never met
[05:56] such incredible people and it did didn't
[05:59] matter where they came from everybody's
[06:01] values were very similar and so we've
[06:04] we've now traveled we've been to
[06:05] homeschooling conferences at Bitcoin
[06:07] conferences we've been we've done things
[06:10] we just never thought we would do I
[06:11] never thought I'd be on a podcast let
[06:13] alone the fact that t and I would would
[06:15] have our own podcast like this these
[06:16] were just things I never would have
[06:19] imagined so the personal fulfillment now
[06:22] is very very high and along with that
[06:25] also as we got into the again I
[06:28] mentioned earlier with the low time for
[06:29] reference I have I have changed things
[06:31] in terms of what I focus on with sleep
[06:33] on what I eat um reduce alcohol just
[06:37] there's a whole bunch of things
[06:38] physically that I've done for myself as
[06:40] as well and I know that kids are still
[06:43] watching even though they're done with
[06:44] school they're watching tly and I work
[06:47] together a lot of couples are they hit
[06:50] hard times and they might get divorced
[06:52] these other things and they're watching
[06:53] their mom and
[06:54] dad do something together for in what
[06:57] they believe in and so
[07:00] it it's just so much more fulfilling
[07:01] it's more fulfilling on a on a a career
[07:04] basis as a as a family basis on a
[07:07] personal basis and the people at a
[07:08] meeting and then we look at the the
[07:12] impact that we think we're going to have
[07:15] so we have these long low time
[07:16] preference goals of what we want to
[07:20] accomplish and the whole thing about
[07:21] free market kids is it's all about if if
[07:24] we're able to get rugged by this Fiat
[07:26] system we got two mbas IV League schools
[07:29] and we get rugged by this vat system
[07:31] what are we going to teach the kids like
[07:33] what are we going to help them with
[07:35] right and then once you start to go down
[07:38] the Bitcoin rabbit hole and you start to
[07:39] study these other areas and you realize
[07:41] the impact on and everything endless
[07:44] Wars what's going on with food you just
[07:47] pick your favorite
[07:48] topic and and then you
[07:51] realize this this is so much bigger than
[07:54] ourselves so your your initial question
[07:55] was is Bitcoin a different game Bitcoin
[07:58] is the infinite game it is something
[07:59] that is way way Beyond us it's bigger
[08:03] than it's bigger than us and there's
[08:06] something very fulfilling knowing that
[08:07] we are doing something that's going to
[08:09] make a positive impact on other people
[08:11] right it's not just our own kids it's
[08:13] going to be whoever we teach through our
[08:14] games it's whoever we can reach through
[08:17] our courses or books it's that the the
[08:20] impact is part of a a thing that's much
[08:24] much bigger than ourselves and and I
[08:26] don't you can't get any more low time
[08:27] preference than that than to just look
[08:30] super long in the future the Next
[08:33] Generation the generations after that
[08:35] the things that we're working on now and
[08:37] trying to help with adoption and try to
[08:39] help people understand it uh whether
[08:41] it's veterans or women or kids or
[08:43] whatever it is that that is very very
[08:46] fulfilling knowing that you're part of a
[08:48] bigger a bigger purpose I I love that a
[08:52] lot and I I see that when I go into the
[08:55] Bitcoin Community there's a lot of hope
[08:57] there's a lot of like we're looking
[08:58] forward to the future and then when you
[09:01] see outside of the Bitcoin Community
[09:03] there's a lot of we are scared of the
[09:05] future we like we we don't look for
[09:07] those future that like they they like
[09:09] living in the moment and not like oh
[09:11] yeah bit the world is great and in five
[09:14] years it will be even better like but in
[09:16] Bitcoin it's actually like that what
[09:18] what role did that hope in that security
[09:21] in that I don't know that that that
[09:23] orange bright light shining from above
[09:27] uh what role did that play in the de
[09:29] ision of like being ENT entrepreneur
[09:31] making a bold decision and and not going
[09:33] the the secure
[09:35] round I I think so part of it I I wish I
[09:39] could say that I just had this great
[09:41] insight and I like this you know some
[09:43] kind of genius moment and I can see it
[09:45] sometimes you just need to start first
[09:48] and then after you go through it you can
[09:49] kind of see it with a different
[09:52] perspective so in hindsight I can say
[09:54] things like we didn't want to be part of
[09:56] the old system at the at the the very
[09:59] moment I was making those decision it
[10:01] was more of of a decision of yes or no
[10:03] are we going to commit to doing
[10:04] something different and then you have to
[10:07] have the courage to go through that next
[10:09] step and then as you're doing that you
[10:11] you make a ton of mistakes you figure
[10:13] things out but you're building up your
[10:16] Your Capacity to do things and then you
[10:18] look back and then your your your
[10:20] confidence has gone up because you're
[10:21] saying look what I just did and so it
[10:23] was like these series of Little Steps we
[10:26] we were committed to what we were going
[10:27] to do went through to some kind of
[10:30] discomfort or challenge as we we would
[10:33] things would not work out the the sales
[10:35] wouldn't work out at a conference or
[10:37] whatever it is something something or
[10:38] whatever
[10:39] disappointment and then you come back to
[10:41] it and now you look back and you say
[10:44] well now you have a whole series of
[10:45] things that we've done over two years
[10:47] that you're just like wow how in the
[10:49] world did we get all that stuff done and
[10:52] then your your confidence is at another
[10:53] level and it opens up yet a whole new
[10:56] set of opportunities for you that you
[10:58] didn't even dream that you
[11:00] had previously so I I don't have I don't
[11:04] know I don't think I'm answering your
[11:05] question exactly but there wasn't this
[11:07] this light bulb moment that said ah
[11:09] Bitcoin and then I just everything was
[11:11] clear it was more of a series of steps
[11:15] trying things some things work some
[11:18] things doesn't you get through it and
[11:20] then each with each one of those steps
[11:22] you're you're you realize that you're
[11:23] growing you're growing not only in your
[11:25] understanding of how things work with
[11:28] Bitcoin um but you're growing this
[11:31] community you're growing the set of
[11:32] experiences and that's it's that it was
[11:36] a more of a baby step type of growth to
[11:39] get to where we're at it was not this
[11:41] light bulb moment and you know I saw the
[11:43] light
[11:44] and everything was good after that um it
[11:48] was but it's been and then once I see it
[11:50] though I I'm just I can't wait to share
[11:53] it with other people I can't wait to try
[11:54] to help other people who whatever stage
[11:57] of Life they're in that doesn't it could
[11:59] be a physical thing it could be hey you
[12:02] you really got to look at your diet you
[12:04] don't realize what's going on with the
[12:05] incentives and the money to to put seed
[12:08] oils and other stuff in this food you
[12:10] don't do you realize what you're doing
[12:11] to yourself you know just it could be
[12:13] something small like that it could be
[12:15] bigger picture it could be hey I want to
[12:18] I don't not only do I want to Ed end the
[12:20] Federal Reserve I want to end the
[12:22] Department of Education right there's
[12:24] like these bigger more philosophical
[12:26] political type of things that
[12:29] uh I would like to help be part of so
[12:32] it's um it just depends on the context
[12:35] of who I'm talking to but it's uh it's
[12:37] so exciting there's so many different
[12:39] areas to get into and you know every day
[12:41] you just get up you're like what am I
[12:42] going to work on how how am I going to
[12:43] move this forward and uh it's pretty
[12:46] exciting so absolutely and I think
[12:50] that's something that I really uh saw in
[12:52] in bitcoiners live like the longer
[12:54] someone holds Bitcoin there the more
[12:57] they tend towards getting healthier uh
[13:01] which which means not only like from a
[13:03] diet and exercise standpoint but also
[13:05] like just from a decision standpoint
[13:07] because they get more secure they get
[13:09] more uh confident and they they tend
[13:11] towards more their passion more what
[13:13] they actually want to do and not like oh
[13:16] yeah I I just do that because I'm scared
[13:18] of what might happen if I change
[13:20] anything so that I see a lot actually in
[13:23] Bitcoin as yeah we see the same thing we
[13:26] see the same type of Trends uh we went
[13:27] to um so went to a game conference
[13:30] because we we have games but we've been
[13:32] to a lot of Bitcoin conferences and then
[13:34] you can you can actually just see it
[13:36] with the people walking by if you're at
[13:38] a Bitcoin event the the the the average
[13:41] physical fitness just not that you can
[13:43] tell what's going on the inside but
[13:44] their average physical fitness from the
[13:46] outside and then you go to a went to a
[13:48] game conference and people are leading
[13:51] very different Lifestyles with their
[13:53] food and exercise sleep
[13:56] Etc it's not only do we pick up in our
[13:59] conversations with people like just it
[14:01] comes up what you just described it
[14:04] comes up so that that theme just runs uh
[14:07] all the time we always see that theme
[14:10] but even if you didn't talk to someone
[14:11] you just you go to different kind of
[14:12] events you can you can just look at the
[14:14] people and
[14:16] observe how they behave how they look
[14:19] what they're eating it just you can
[14:21] actually see it it's it's it's it's a
[14:25] it's it's eye opening in terms of and
[14:27] then you say all these health problems
[14:28] we have
[14:29] my God they like we already know what
[14:32] the answer
[14:33] is like we could we could stop this we
[14:36] don't have to have I don't know anyway
[14:38] it's I'm just trying to agree with you
[14:41] it it is we definitely see the same
[14:42] thing so absolutely yeah it's
[14:45] fascinating because yeah you have a
[14:47] Bitcoin game so obviously you are at
[14:48] Bitcoin conferences and at games
[14:50] conferences uh never thought about that
[14:52] because then you see really nicely there
[14:55] uh you are the the constant because you
[14:57] and uh your proven what are you doing is
[15:00] is the same thing basically in both
[15:03] conferences um but the mission is maybe
[15:05] a little bit different but the audience
[15:07] is then a complete different one because
[15:10] at game conference I imagine uh you get
[15:13] a lot of questions like oh what is
[15:15] bitcoin like why why I game around
[15:18] Bitcoin and stuff like that uh and then
[15:20] of course like the the changes and the
[15:22] differences between an preer or audience
[15:25] and a yeah Bitcoin audience yeah did you
[15:28] I I'm try remember I don't remember if
[15:29] you and toally talked about the the
[15:31] experience we had when we go to
[15:32] homeschooling conferences same thing
[15:34] like it's still it's still us still it's
[15:37] still this overlap we want to talk about
[15:39] money literacy we want to talk about
[15:40] Australian economics we want to talk
[15:42] about Bitcoin and if if I'm repeating
[15:45] this you just stop me so that you know
[15:47] we don't we don't have to go over
[15:49] material you already have but if I'm if
[15:51] I'm talking to another bitcoiner and
[15:52] they they have young kids or they're
[15:54] thinking about having kids and I and you
[15:56] say self- custody education they can I
[15:59] can get I can convince almost any
[16:01] bitcoiner to homeschool or that
[16:02] homeschooling is a good thing separation
[16:04] of education and state the self- custody
[16:08] piece just there's so many similarities
[16:10] on there but when you go to a
[16:12] homeschooling conference it's still us
[16:14] still the same same people but they they
[16:17] see that Bitcoin and they they think
[16:19] you're a scam they don't know what to do
[16:22] with it they they and be so you know I
[16:27] because you guys I mean depending what
[16:29] country homeschooling is not even legal
[16:31] so I don't know I'm not sure where
[16:32] you're at if it's uh Austria and uh uh I
[16:37] don't know how how it's possible I think
[16:40] it's actually not possible entirely I
[16:43] think you you can do it somehow but you
[16:46] still have to be connected to that I
[16:48] talked with someone uh like a few weeks
[16:50] ago but uh didn't remember exactly but
[16:53] it's not really possible like you have
[16:55] have to be very connected with the
[16:57] ucation system well we talk to um a
[17:00] bitcoiner she she's from Germany and she
[17:02] said she just left it's illegal to
[17:04] homeschool so the but you you go to them
[17:08] and they have in the US anyways that
[17:09] their understanding of what money is is
[17:11] Dave Ramsey I'm going to do your budget
[17:13] and try to get out of debt it doesn't
[17:16] account for the the inflation of the
[17:18] money supply and what that does at all
[17:21] so it's a it's more like a budgeting
[17:23] type of thing which if money's only
[17:25] slowly losing value okay not not a bad
[17:29] set of things to learn but it completely
[17:31] misses the main things that bitcoiners
[17:33] are looking at with there's a
[17:35] fundamental issue with our system
[17:38] there's a there are fundamental issues
[17:40] so the the problem in that setting is
[17:43] we've got multiple layers first I have
[17:45] to like they don't the awareness of what
[17:46] money what's going on with money is
[17:48] different than what they're they're used
[17:50] to so then you and then you're going to
[17:52] say that there's there's there is
[17:53] another way look at this here's here is
[17:56] what Bitcoin can do and then by the way
[17:58] here's free market kids and we can help
[18:00] you learn all that like so there's like
[18:01] these there's like multiple hurdles to
[18:04] get through
[18:05] and the it's but it is changing the
[18:08] Overton window is changing so if you
[18:10] haven't heard of it already the the
[18:12] Tuttle twins are are huge in the
[18:14] homeschooling space and they've been
[18:18] getting more and more vocal about
[18:20] helping explain what Bitcoin is to to
[18:22] Young so when we the first time we set
[18:25] up a booth we had the Bitcoin up and
[18:28] this was before Tuttle twins was doing
[18:30] that and people just looked at us like
[18:32] you're crazy like what who are you what
[18:34] the hell is that thing that's a scam
[18:35] they they didn't they we didn't get this
[18:37] warm welcome that we were bringing them
[18:39] something to help them um my prediction
[18:42] is it'll take another few years things
[18:45] like
[18:46] things from the Tuttle Twins and others
[18:49] are going to help move that needle the
[18:50] fact that Bitcoin is in in the news the
[18:52] the regular news cycle now that's going
[18:55] to shift their their opinions over time
[18:57] but so far
[18:59] people don't know what to do with us
[19:00] when we go they're looking at us like
[19:02] we're like huh okay and then they just
[19:06] keep on going um it it's just so
[19:09] different from anything else that
[19:10] they've had and so the same thing with
[19:12] the gamers if you're comparing to games
[19:15] the if they're true hardcore Gamers they
[19:17] just they may want something with really
[19:19] great game mechanics on it and they
[19:22] might want world world uh renowned
[19:25] artists and and other things so our
[19:28] games don't compete rep on that our our
[19:30] games are built on like they're fun but
[19:33] they're not meant to be played for five
[19:35] hours straight or something like that
[19:36] you're meant to play it in 45 minutes
[19:38] it's meant to have good strategy
[19:40] elements to it chance elements to it but
[19:42] it's all based on some some first
[19:44] principle so the one that we were known
[19:47] for most is huddle up it's all based on
[19:50] how Bitcoin mining works right so then
[19:53] we our our long-term goal is that every
[19:55] year we're going to put out a new first
[19:57] principal game on some other area so
[19:59] maybe it's whatever it is low time
[20:01] preference it could be energy it could
[20:03] be whatever it is so we have Lightning
[20:05] game now a seed Phrase game we're going
[20:07] to make fun of the the FED um soon with
[20:12] a Fed Up game um so it's the games the
[20:16] The Gamers it's a there's tens of
[20:19] thousands of new games out all the time
[20:22] there's that it doesn't matter to them
[20:24] it just it's not that okay whatever you
[20:26] put a B on your game yeah like it's just
[20:29] not it's hard to reach a gamer now I did
[20:31] the way that I try to get the gamers um
[20:34] we have every year we're going to put
[20:35] out a high-end version of the game so I
[20:38] have a I have a low time preference
[20:40] version of huddle up especially for the
[20:43] having Edition so the Box itself opens
[20:45] up in half and has metal
[20:47] pieces I might be able to get the gamers
[20:50] that way because when you walk by that
[20:51] game it just you with metal coins and
[20:53] things like that I can the quality of
[20:55] the game will get their attention but
[20:58] but in terms of the things that you and
[21:00] I are talking about from a Bitcoin
[21:02] standpoint it doesn't it doesn't matter
[21:04] to them in fact it actually works
[21:05] against you if you say this game is
[21:07] educational it's going to be labeled as
[21:09] boring like you're just out of the gate
[21:11] it doesn't matter if it actually is fun
[21:13] or not if you label it as educational
[21:15] you're
[21:16] done to the gamers that's not what they
[21:18] want that's not what they want so very
[21:21] different audio I guess they are there
[21:24] for for playing games but you can you
[21:26] can also learn something while having
[21:28] fun playing a game yeah I just don't
[21:30] just don't tell them just don't tell
[21:32] them that part don't tell them they're
[21:34] learning anything otherwise if you tell
[21:36] them it's you're going to learn
[21:37] something you
[21:39] just
[21:41] no your label is boring and you're done
[21:44] yeah we'll we'll keep trying that that
[21:47] one's going to that one's going to take
[21:48] a while are you doing that with with
[21:50] with the games and going down to the
[21:52] conferences so I I just always liked
[21:55] games and that was one of the reasons
[21:57] that I wanted to put games in to the our
[21:59] homeschooling kind of mix because I just
[22:02] like Gams so I've been going probably to
[22:04] the one the big one in the US is Gen Con
[22:06] I've been going to that probably a
[22:09] decade um my brother and I go every year
[22:12] it's just we go there and it's only more
[22:15] recently as we got as we started to
[22:16] actually build a business around how
[22:18] we're going to use games as part of a
[22:21] bridge to pre- Corners that I that was
[22:23] more businesslike as opposed to hobby
[22:26] like but i' I'd say it's been over a
[22:29] decade that we've been going to him and
[22:32] and that's what my my question is
[22:34] leaning up to is like H how different do
[22:38] you see that they are perceiving Bitcoin
[22:41] now over the years do you see a
[22:43] difference between like a few years ago
[22:45] uh or are we are we all in a bubble like
[22:49] H H how do you see the absolute no
[22:52] coiner crowd seeing the game uh and
[22:55] perceiving Bitcoin itself yeah at all
[22:59] it's near zero I I tried to not this
[23:02] past year the year before I volunteered
[23:04] to do a uh a breakout session so when
[23:07] you go to these conferences you can sign
[23:09] up to give a you can give a little talk
[23:11] on something basically or play a game
[23:12] with people and you can tell them
[23:13] whatever it is I had one person show up
[23:17] I mean this is this is a it's a crowd of
[23:18] 50,000 people or whatever and I just
[23:22] thinking nobody they just it's just not
[23:25] on the radar just not on the radar at
[23:27] all um and that's and that's okay I mean
[23:31] we're I mean I don't we didn't go into
[23:33] this to become a game company we don't
[23:35] think of ourselves as a game company
[23:37] we're we're we have that label because
[23:40] that's that's that we that's the way
[23:43] that we kind of broke onto the scene in
[23:45] the Bitcoin space and and that's okay
[23:48] because I like games I'm going to keep
[23:49] making games they're good for
[23:51] interacting you and I can talk to each
[23:53] other without a without watching a
[23:55] screen you know we got you know if we're
[23:57] in person at a Meetup or or whatever it
[23:59] is we're going to hang out you get your
[24:01] favorite beverage and we'll we're going
[24:03] to hang out and if the kids are there
[24:05] maybe they learn about cold storage or
[24:07] something else that's that's that's good
[24:09] for them um so for from my perspective
[24:13] the games
[24:14] will they they're they differentiate us
[24:17] because it it does help um one thing I
[24:19] will say on the games is I think a lot
[24:21] of a lot of people who become passionate
[24:23] about Bitcoin if they're they're very
[24:25] technical if they're an engineer maybe
[24:27] they're in finance
[24:29] if they're already into some type of
[24:32] coding then going to a bit devs or
[24:35] listening to hours of videos and things
[24:38] they they're they can get excited about
[24:41] it we need to be able to reach people
[24:43] who don't fit that and my wife tally
[24:47] fits in that category so she wouldn't
[24:49] even I was trying to get her to listen
[24:51] to books on on on Audible I was trying
[24:53] to get her to listen to podcasts and
[24:55] watch videos and this is back when the
[24:57] kids were still going through school and
[25:00] she just didn't have time she's looking
[25:01] at me like I'm crazy but once she
[25:04] started to physically move things around
[25:06] that represented what was going on that
[25:08] tactile feel she opened up to it and
[25:12] we've seen it with a number of we we've
[25:15] seen it over and over at different
[25:17] in-person events um especially with the
[25:19] women I mean you you and I don't want to
[25:21] be sexist about it but the the number of
[25:23] women that have said this really helped
[25:25] because you go into these usually male
[25:28] dominated meetups or whatever they are
[25:31] in conferences and it just they're we're
[25:33] not we're not talking to them the way
[25:35] that they want to communicate and for
[25:38] tally she said this this was very
[25:40] helpful because now I can kind of see it
[25:42] I can take those Concepts I have an idea
[25:44] what they're talking about and that's
[25:46] all I need and then that was kind of her
[25:47] feedback that's all she needed to get
[25:49] started so I'm looking at the games as
[25:53] they're just a different way of trying
[25:55] to reach people as well I happen like
[25:58] games so I also want to make sure
[26:00] they're fun that's it like I don't want
[26:02] to make a boring game uh that that just
[26:06] that would suck but um but that's where
[26:08] that's where I see games fitting in I
[26:10] don't see it being oh yeah they're a
[26:12] game company and they go to all the game
[26:14] all game shows and and things like that
[26:18] that's not the most exciting thing to me
[26:21] going back to the earlier part of our
[26:23] conversation is when you see somebody
[26:25] when the light bulb goes on and they
[26:27] start to
[26:28] understand what this this strange
[26:31] Bitcoin thing is and they become
[26:34] interested in it and like that that that
[26:38] moves you like when you see somebody who
[26:40] who who has has made that step and you
[26:43] know that once they start learning
[26:45] they'll go down their own rabbit holes
[26:46] but you've helped them
[26:48] along that is that's fulfilling right
[26:51] and that's that's where I just see the
[26:53] roles of games that are are in there
[26:55] it's just one of multiple things in a
[26:57] toolbox
[26:59] that we're going to use to reach people
[27:01] absolutely and because she she came up
[27:04] already a lot uh we made a podcast
[27:07] together Tali and I think I don't know
[27:09] it's probably 100 episodes ago something
[27:11] like that uh I think when you type in
[27:13] Tali in my my podcast uh search you
[27:16] probably will show up for those people
[27:19] who who want to hear the the other side
[27:21] of that and it's fascinating because I
[27:24] still remember a little bit of that and
[27:25] yeah it was exactly like that but it's
[27:27] it's really cool uh to to see both sides
[27:32] of this Bitcoin family talking about
[27:35] that yeah I appreciate that I
[27:37] intentionally have not watched it uh
[27:39] until after we do ours then I'll go back
[27:41] and I'll yeah really cool yeah we talked
[27:44] a lot about yeah homeschooling and and
[27:47] stuff like that also yeah and and her
[27:49] way into into Bitcoin but yeah it's uh
[27:52] for for people that want to check it out
[27:54] that that's I think that's really cooler
[27:56] after that podcast than than than than
[27:58] if you haven't done so yeah well then
[28:00] we'll ince our kids and you can just
[28:02] interv interview the whole family and uh
[28:04] you know let's get the whole family
[28:07] on how how old are your your kids right
[28:10] now so see
[28:13] 17 I gota be careful what when the
[28:15] birthday season starts I think we're uh
[28:18] 17 19 21
[28:20] 22 oh yeah that's that's that's good I
[28:24] had um the the youngest kid was 13 but
[28:28] then like 15 the next one and 19 so I
[28:30] had like some young kids on but it's
[28:32] it's always great to hear like really
[28:35] from uh because I think like the Bitcoin
[28:37] community in general like is is is
[28:39] pretty old actually like I was
[28:41] fascinated by by how mature the the the
[28:44] Bitcoin Community already is like my
[28:46] audience it's not old but it's like uh
[28:49] for for someone who has a YouTube
[28:51] channel that is them himself 26 it's
[28:55] uncommon to have an audience that is on
[28:58] average almost 50 uh I have I have three
[29:02] times as many listeners above 65 then
[29:04] under 25 so uh it's it's uncommon I
[29:08] think for a young YouTuber to to have
[29:10] that audience but it's because the the
[29:12] Bitcoin audience is like that yeah I
[29:14] meant to say I I had it written down so
[29:16] I wouldn't forget congratulations on you
[29:18] 10,000 subscribers I think was that your
[29:21] thank you so much yeah yeah that is
[29:22] fantastic so that uh yeah it's admirable
[29:26] you tell like wow that's just cool like
[29:28] it just it was motivating for us to see
[29:31] what you were able to do in a very short
[29:33] period of time so obviously it's
[29:34] resonating so so keep it up yeah yeah
[29:38] thank you so it's it's uh because I kind
[29:41] of just started that and was like oh
[29:43] yeah people just like it oh there's a
[29:44] sponsor coming oh guess I have a
[29:45] business then I have to quit my job back
[29:47] but I told that story many times on the
[29:49] podcast uh that would B people that more
[29:54] often times but yeah it's it's uh the
[29:56] podcast has been a great great success
[29:58] till now it's it's not even a full year
[30:02] I'm not even doing it a full year now uh
[30:04] and it's already at over 11,000 uh
[30:08] subscribers only on YouTube it has been
[30:10] really good well I also am excited
[30:13] because today is the the 31st right and
[30:17] so depending on so I want to actually
[30:20] get your opinion do because there's
[30:22] there's kind of that internal Bitcoin
[30:24] what is the real birth date of Bitcoin
[30:27] is it is it the white paper which is
[30:29] anniversary today right is it the first
[30:32] is it the Genesis block on January 3rd
[30:36] or is it pizza day when you had the
[30:38] first transaction in May so I my my
[30:41] opinion is it's the first block Genesis
[30:43] block but some people think today
[30:44] they'll say you know today is the day
[30:46] the white paper was published therefore
[30:47] today is the birthday of Bitcoin so I
[30:49] don't know what your opinion is but I
[30:51] feel honored that if you're doing this
[30:52] daily that I got to be on on the on the
[30:56] white paper day
[31:02] really really cool yeah that that that's
[31:04] true um there's an interesting question
[31:07] um I don't think the first transaction
[31:09] is is the is the birth date of of of
[31:11] Bitcoin I think first transaction is an
[31:13] major
[31:14] Milestone uh but the first transaction I
[31:17] don't I don't think that classifies for
[31:20] the the birth day like if we think about
[31:23] a human being maybe I don't know if it's
[31:25] weird to compare a human being to
[31:27] bitcoin but if we talk about bir thingss
[31:30] um like the first step is kind of the
[31:32] first transaction uh then like uh the
[31:36] Genesis blog would be like the the baby
[31:38] actually being born and the birth date
[31:40] for me and then the white paper is kind
[31:42] of like you get the know that you're
[31:44] pregnant like that's how I see
[31:46] it okay all right well that's actually
[31:50] that actually that analogy makes a lot
[31:51] of sense so you know depending and I
[31:53] think In some cultures they they go by
[31:56] you know you back it up a year or to
[31:57] like Inception kind of thing I know in
[32:00] the US it's your actual day that you
[32:01] were born so uh it's a cultural thing
[32:03] maybe I don't know but I think yeah I
[32:08] also think with uh companies it's also
[32:10] like that because uh you you have an
[32:12] official started of the company but
[32:16] usually the company starts inofficial or
[32:20] in the head or with an idea or with
[32:21] research or whatever like 3 months 6
[32:24] months or maybe even like a year before
[32:26] that uh so like that's kind of the wide
[32:29] paper where it first got shared because
[32:32] if if it if it's not even started yet if
[32:35] it's not running anywhere then it's just
[32:37] an idea at this point uh it's it's
[32:41] already there like you someone could
[32:43] have already started it like
[32:46] earlier but yeah but you just said I
[32:48] mean I asked you you said it's been do
[32:50] you've been doing it less than a year
[32:51] but that's that's going from your first
[32:52] show right you probably had the idea
[32:55] long before
[32:56] that yeah I made made uh I mean uh the
[33:00] idea of the podcast I had I think a week
[33:02] before I started so actually like not
[33:04] that long before but I made videos uh
[33:08] before that and I was already on social
[33:12] media with Twitter a lot and I made some
[33:14] short videos uh but the podcast actually
[33:18] that was like an idea and like then I
[33:21] invited a bunch of people and yeah then
[33:24] then I had my first podcast so that was
[33:26] really quick oh okay that's pretty cool
[33:29] okay what I I got you really off track
[33:31] whatever you're
[33:35] whatever one question that that I was in
[33:37] my mind because I'm um it has nothing to
[33:39] do with Bitcoin uh but I'm a really big
[33:43] uh um board game um uh not not nerd but
[33:48] uh I I really like board games and I
[33:50] almost play every day with my girlfriend
[33:53] uh when we have the chance to and I love
[33:56] like I play Everyday chess on on on my
[33:58] phone it's kind of an addiction for me
[34:01] but I also really like uh Ramy cup uh
[34:04] playing with her it's it's it's a
[34:06] massively nice game I don't know if you
[34:08] know it
[34:09] this if you can yeah tell me about it
[34:12] because and I gonna look it up
[34:14] afterwards too Ramic cup is uh oh
[34:17] basically you you have to come uh to get
[34:20] like two players you have uh stones and
[34:23] you have to put like a sequence of of
[34:27] numbers or colors together it's really a
[34:30] very chilled game I will I will uh um
[34:33] give it to you afterwards but my
[34:35] question was like what's your favorite
[34:37] game of of all the all the the games out
[34:41] there that are oh wow popular so that
[34:44] people actually know it also not like my
[34:46] Ramy cup
[34:48] um okay so I I again the for me the
[34:51] context always matters so the the game
[34:53] that I've probably played the most of I
[34:56] wouldn't say is the most fun uh
[34:58] necessarily but it's most traditional so
[35:00] in my family cribbage has been played by
[35:04] many many generations so my I played
[35:06] with my grandfather who had played with
[35:09] Generations before him and now our kids
[35:12] have played with with my dad so like
[35:14] when we get together we always play um
[35:18] we always play cribbage uh there I I
[35:21] think um some games that I like for the
[35:25] family um we've we we've played um what
[35:30] do you call that game uh there's code
[35:33] names there's um oh just remember I just
[35:37] we just played a different game I just
[35:38] can't escape it um I've liked Katon I
[35:41] just I like some of the more popular
[35:42] ones that have been out there um out
[35:45] there like that the ones that as a game
[35:48] designer that that I really like are
[35:52] ones that have really complex strategies
[35:54] but really simple rules so that would be
[35:58] go or something like manulla something
[36:02] like that where you can I can teach you
[36:04] the rules in I don't know a couple
[36:06] seconds and then trying to figure out
[36:09] the strategies of that people will go to
[36:11] college try to figure out that they'll
[36:12] go to a college just to learn how to
[36:14] play Go Go
[36:16] strategies there so from a game design
[36:18] standpoint I anything that that to me is
[36:20] just elegant if you can come up with
[36:22] something that is really really simple
[36:24] with the rules but has all these
[36:26] variations I just I just there's
[36:28] something in the Elegance of that the
[36:31] fellowship thing is what I like to do
[36:33] with the family though Splendor that was
[36:35] one we played recently um if it's
[36:37] something where people of different
[36:39] Generations can play together and you
[36:42] can finish it in about an hour you have
[36:44] a little bit of luck in there because if
[36:46] it's a pure strategy game like if I get
[36:48] too technical like again to stop me but
[36:51] if you're in a pure strategy game like
[36:52] chess and there's zero luck and you're a
[36:55] better player than me it's not not fun
[36:57] to play anymore because I know you're
[36:59] going to just you're you're going to
[37:00] kick my butt every time you go and play
[37:02] Katon and now you've got some entropy in
[37:04] there and now even new players have a
[37:07] chance of winning right and so the games
[37:10] I like for families and for friends are
[37:13] the games where we can just be together
[37:16] and if you have some entropy in it so
[37:19] think of again like a Katon if you have
[37:21] some of that in there if you look at
[37:22] huddle up you can have a strategy in
[37:25] huddle up you can you can say say I'm
[37:27] going to I'm going to have a hash
[37:28] strategy I'm going to get I'm going to
[37:30] buy extra mining rigs or I have a cold a
[37:33] cold storage strategy or I have you can
[37:35] have whatever strategy you want but at
[37:36] the end of the day there are cards in
[37:38] there and there's a die in there so
[37:39] there's entropy so I I can get beat at
[37:42] my own game and especially with the
[37:44] younger generation like it just seems to
[37:46] happen that way um I I just want the
[37:50] fellowship and I want it to be fun and
[37:52] so the Elegance of the game and stuff
[37:54] doesn't really matter as much as is it
[37:57] something
[37:58] that that you can play and it's it's not
[38:01] not overly complex but yet you do have
[38:04] some strategy um skull King is another
[38:06] one it's a card game that we've we've
[38:08] played a lot because you don't need a
[38:11] lot of skill people laugh a lot and you
[38:14] just you're just hanging out so I'm I'm
[38:17] going for the
[38:18] fellowship side on on the on the games
[38:21] and then at the same thing that's kind
[38:23] of the reason for cribbage right it
[38:24] doesn't it's it's less important that
[38:26] we're playing the game of Cribbage
[38:28] as it is it's just a tradition that all
[38:30] these different Generations have played
[38:31] with each
[38:32] other and they get to spend time with
[38:35] each other even though they may not have
[38:36] a lot in common with whatever is going
[38:38] on their in their in their lives if you
[38:39] want the geeky side of me I'm going to
[38:41] go one way the the personal side of what
[38:44] I personally
[38:45] enjoy I I I just want to I want to spend
[38:48] time with family and friends I want I
[38:50] want to spend time with other bitcoiners
[38:52] right and that it has to be playable in
[38:54] less than an hour otherwise people are
[38:56] going to be like this is too long I
[38:57] don't want want to do it right uh but
[39:00] people love to sit down and have a drink
[39:01] and play a game okay like that's just
[39:04] awesome like I just you just get to know
[39:06] people quiet people get to open up a
[39:08] little bit um and then on the education
[39:11] side of course that's a different
[39:12] discussion that's that's that was our
[39:15] prior discussion um so yeah so it's it's
[39:20] it depends on on the on the audience but
[39:22] um if we were going to get together you
[39:24] know I would love to play I would love
[39:26] to play huddle up with you
[39:27] like because you're a bitcoiner right I
[39:29] would like to play Channel up with you
[39:31] because that's our Lightning game you
[39:33] know I think that would be we could have
[39:35] fun because as we're playing we're
[39:37] probably going to talk about some other
[39:38] subjects that we both enjoy uh but it
[39:41] would also be kind of cool to just hang
[39:42] out and just get to know somebody so
[39:46] absolutely I think that that would be
[39:48] great are you at any conferences or
[39:50] something like that the next one I'm
[39:52] going to be in adopting Bitcoin in El
[39:54] Salvador will be there also really cool
[39:56] are you you there oh that's fantastic
[39:58] are you going to adopting Bitcoin yeah I
[40:01] will be at adopting Bitcoin uh in in in
[40:04] uh November so like I leave actually
[40:07] also in like 10 11 days something like
[40:09] that uh and we'll be there for like a
[40:12] week something like that okay that's
[40:14] awesome so um how I meant to ask though
[40:17] the unconference me Premier Bitcoin is
[40:19] putting on an unconference the day prior
[40:22] to adopting Bitcoin if if you can get to
[40:26] that that we went last year that is
[40:28] probably one of the best Bitcoin events
[40:31] I've ever been to you're looking at 100
[40:33] to 150 people amazing
[40:36] venue and it's it's so that the signal
[40:39] is so high you're just actually engaging
[40:41] with each other like literally like
[40:43] we're doing now as opposed to some of
[40:45] the bigger conferences I they they serve
[40:47] a different purpose but they're very
[40:50] focused on who's the next speaker who
[40:52] has a who has a display of something
[40:55] that you want to go check out whereas
[40:56] the unconference is literally you may
[40:59] not know what you're going to talk about
[41:00] so if you go to the end
[41:02] conference and just to give you a flavor
[41:04] you you come to un conference there's
[41:06] nothing on the schedule that you have no
[41:08] idea you haven't even looked at it um
[41:10] they'll kick it off and they'll say does
[41:11] anybody have anything they want to talk
[41:12] about and then people will line up and
[41:16] you say okay you you grab the microphone
[41:17] and they say Okay Robin you get one
[41:19] minute and you say hey I'm Robin and I
[41:22] want to talk about X Y and Z subject
[41:25] whatever it is and here's why and then
[41:27] they pass it to the next person and then
[41:28] they just figure who everybody who wants
[41:30] to go talk with Robin about that subject
[41:32] X Y and Z you guys are going to go in
[41:34] that tent and someone it's it's very
[41:36] it's very free which as opposed to very
[41:39] structured and that's the unconference
[41:41] aspect of it uh that's the day before
[41:44] adopting Bitcoin if you can get there I
[41:47] promise you you you're going to have a
[41:49] amazing wonderful time uh so that
[41:52] whatever that day is I think that's the
[41:53] 14th I partnered up with coin vigilant
[41:57] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time

[44:32] so yeah I will will uh will be there
[44:35] cool really cool thank you so much for
[44:37] the tip I never heard about that I I did
[44:39] an interview with me R Bitcoin
[44:43] but Jamie ah wait wait wait wait how was
[44:49] I guess it could have been jamy I forgot
[44:53] it's and since maybe I get get it lat in
[44:56] the podcast
[44:58] but I I will I I will the thing that I
[45:01] want to show you earlier I wanted to
[45:03] show you Ramy cup that's the do you know
[45:06] it oh yeah we used to call it Ry uh I
[45:09] have I have that from uh we I pronounced
[45:13] it differently that was the problem I
[45:14] used to we used to call uh when I was
[45:17] growing up we maybe it's maybe it's
[45:18] pronounced like that I don't
[45:20] know I'm going to trust you on the
[45:22] pronunciation rather than me but
[45:24] um I'm usually I'm usually wrong with
[45:27] pronunciation people uh get mad at me
[45:30] because in my ad spot I said elent and I
[45:33] cannot pronounce it
[45:35] nicely that makes it more authentic I
[45:37] think that's good yes I have played this
[45:40] before we um we'll play um we'll play Ry
[45:44] but with
[45:45] cards like the the traditional Ry game
[45:48] oh you you you play it with cards
[45:50] interesting yeah it's just it's a
[45:52] traditional card game if you just look
[45:54] up Ry um just Ry like that
[45:57] I think it's a y I'm trying to try Ramy
[46:00] yeah yeah yeah Ramy card game like
[46:05] that yeah oh you can play it with the
[46:07] normal cards nice the principles are the
[46:10] same you just play and you can play with
[46:11] the regular so if you're traveling for
[46:13] example it's a lot easier to carry a
[46:15] deck of cards with you than uh a bunch
[46:17] of tiles so uh you can just learn I mean
[46:21] for you you would just stick a pack of
[46:23] cards in your in your whatever backpack
[46:25] or where you're traveling with and then
[46:26] just learn the rules on that and you're
[46:28] basically playing it's it's not exactly
[46:30] the same but it's very very similar
[46:32] interesting yeah I I love that game and
[46:35] it's it's a game that's a little bit
[46:37] harder to take with you in in holidays
[46:39] even though it's quite like it's not
[46:41] that hard because you just have like the
[46:43] stones and and somewhere to put it uh so
[46:46] you can easily put it somewhere but uh
[46:48] card game is even better because you can
[46:49] take it even to do the restaurants like
[46:51] that and stuff like that yeah you ever
[46:53] play
[46:55] majan no majan I don't about m t's uh
[46:58] well my family for whatever reason
[47:00] played even though they're not Chinese
[47:02] but it's a Chinese game M AJ O N I
[47:05] forget the spelling now it's a like dead
[47:07] R yep there you go M HJ o n g yeah I got
[47:10] close okay yeah it's but you you
[47:13] certainly can't carry it around with you
[47:14] but um the tiles have if you get a good
[47:18] quality game the tiles just feel great
[47:19] and they make a lot very cool noises uh
[47:22] to play but that one um you probably
[47:26] want to find some other people who like
[47:27] games because it's not going to be as
[47:30] easy to learn um it's not going to be
[47:32] easy like Ry interesting yeah but yeah
[47:35] let's I sorry for the the short game
[47:39] trip here because I like I like games a
[47:41] lot and maybe people are like wait I
[47:44] will see for a Bitcoin podcast yeah yeah
[47:47] I mean I love the game thing I that's
[47:48] why I sent you that other presentation
[47:49] ahead of time because I I T the one
[47:52] thing she did tell me was that you guys
[47:54] did not go deep on the games and so I
[47:56] said okay okay well maybe this
[47:58] will this will help and that's why I
[48:00] sent you the other other presentation
[48:02] shortly before we started absolutely
[48:04] yeah and the the other thing the I think
[48:06] that's probably the most feared game but
[48:08] it's very popular as you know
[48:10] Monopoly that that's probably maybe
[48:13] that's that's the opposite of what
[48:15] you're doing if you pull up the um if
[48:18] you pull up the deck that I sent you I
[48:20] actually I got tired of people saying
[48:23] because I'd have I'd have huddle up out
[48:25] and they say okay this is Bitcoin game
[48:28] and and then they say you what about
[48:31] what about where's Bitcoin Monopoly and
[48:32] I kept trying to think I just like
[48:34] Monopoly is a Fiat game like Bitcoin is
[48:37] not
[48:38] Fiat and so finally I just got
[48:40] frustrated enough that I just took the
[48:42] same so in the game of huddle up you
[48:43] have this the time chain the issuance
[48:46] schedule because it's actually 21
[48:48] million that's represented by the the
[48:50] tokens and they have Habs so it's the
[48:53] the the
[48:55] um yeah well p uh that's a good question
[48:59] it's towards the it's towards the the
[49:02] end if you go towards
[49:05] the right there that one okay this is
[49:08] hard to see where it says traditional
[49:09] there it's meant to look like a Monopoly
[49:12] board do you see that and so what
[49:15] happened is those these are all
[49:17] different versions of huddle up it's the
[49:19] same game the one the far left is what
[49:21] it looks like the cardboard version so
[49:23] the the the size of the hex's there are
[49:26] the same size as a um Katon game and in
[49:30] fact some people say hey that looks like
[49:32] Katon then I get this Bitcoin question
[49:34] or I'm sorry the Monopoly question and I
[49:36] just got tired of it so I took the exact
[49:39] same issue in schedule saying here's in
[49:41] the game you start with this and then
[49:42] you go here and you have a having and
[49:43] then you go to this and you have a
[49:44] having and then at the end of the game
[49:46] whoever's huddled up the most wins and
[49:48] all I did is I made them Squares instead
[49:50] of hexagons and change the color so it's
[49:53] the same game right nothing has changed
[49:55] but I said I'm if you want it to look
[49:57] like Monopoly fine I'll make it look
[49:58] like Monopoly and so I have this ad- on
[50:00] board and it was it was partly for fun
[50:03] and partly um you know it was it was
[50:07] partly just to to make it look different
[50:08] if if that helps
[50:10] somebody play because it looks more
[50:12] familiar to them then I'm okay with that
[50:15] I mean if there's someone who's who's my
[50:17] age who's more familiar with Monopoly
[50:19] and they they and that helps them start
[50:24] then that's okay you know but what but I
[50:26] learn Le that process tooo though
[50:28] is I can make this game look like
[50:30] anything I can the the high-end game
[50:32] looks kind of like Casino I can make it
[50:34] look like a certain culture uh there's a
[50:37] lot of future opportunity to adapt this
[50:41] even though the mechanics they're all
[50:43] based on they're all based on bitcoin
[50:46] like they don't change but from a a game
[50:49] standpoint I can change the look and
[50:51] feel of it to make it look like pretty
[50:54] much anything you want you know so I
[50:56] don't know what a I don't know like what
[50:58] a good Austria game is but you know we
[51:01] could you and I could probably work
[51:02] together and say here are things that
[51:04] are very unique to our culture and and
[51:07] this is a game that you know and if we
[51:08] can make it look like this then we could
[51:11] probably make a huddle up version that
[51:13] would appeal to people in Austria and
[51:16] like we can do that anywhere so it's
[51:18] like it it's just it's I it doesn't it's
[51:20] not going to generate a lot of Revenue
[51:22] but it's from an art standpoint it's it
[51:24] could be a lot of fun because you you
[51:27] know you get to you get to just get
[51:29] creative with it so um I I like that so
[51:34] I I want to share one more game uh with
[51:37] you uh it's a it's a party game uh and
[51:41] it's it's super fun especially if if you
[51:43] have like a a late night house party
[51:46] where like I don't know eight friends
[51:47] are here or something like that so like
[51:48] you need a little bit more people for
[51:50] that and you don't need anything for
[51:51] that you just need like pen and paper
[51:53] for that pen and paper and a bowl
[51:55] basically and what you do is like
[51:57] everyone uh let's say there are 10
[51:59] people Everyone writes three words on a
[52:02] piece of paper whatever the word is uh
[52:05] and they are put in a bowl and then uh
[52:08] there are two teams and you have to
[52:10] guess Guess The Words the first round is
[52:12] with just um speaking about it the
[52:15] second round is with like making signs
[52:19] uh and the third round and the third one
[52:21] is the best like it's always in every
[52:22] round it's the same words so you know
[52:25] with the first round you know all the
[52:26] words all the words are played and then
[52:28] you start over the whole new words like
[52:32] the same words about uh in the whole
[52:34] words again in the second round with
[52:37] like Signs and then in the third round
[52:39] you only make noises and that's fun uh
[52:43] because you can only make noises and
[52:44] then you're like oh what is that noise
[52:47] like how do you make a noise of like I
[52:50] don't know uh anything that that you
[52:52] read on a a piece of paper but it's it's
[52:54] a seriously fun uh game okay that that
[52:58] sounds awesome but the way you first
[53:00] described it also reminded me of this
[53:02] game I don't know if it's the glare
[53:03] there or not oh
[53:07] yeah9 it's on the list that that I share
[53:09] with you so this game is based on on bip
[53:12] the actual bip 39 list of words and uh
[53:18] it's meant to be a party game so you can
[53:19] do collaborative boys against girls or
[53:21] individuals however you want to do it
[53:23] but you there going to be three words so
[53:25] that's why it reminds of what you just
[53:27] said so the the everybody gets the same
[53:29] deck of cards and what I did is I took
[53:31] the the bip 39 list and I put them into
[53:34] categories and I and I was trying to
[53:36] make a game out of it I'm like how do I
[53:37] make a game out of these seed phrases
[53:38] out of uh these these words on the bit
[53:41] list bit 39 list and and it the animals
[53:45] came out to be just a little bit more
[53:46] than a deck than a standard deck it was
[53:49] 74 so anything that was related to a
[53:51] living creature at some point I I put it
[53:53] into there so you and me and and and
[53:55] four of the people people we all get
[53:57] it's a different color deck but it's the
[53:58] same list of words and then we pick an
[54:01] Oracle and we say Okay Robin you're
[54:02] going to be the Oracle you pick three
[54:05] words and you put them in order right
[54:08] everybody takes turns asking the Oracle
[54:10] questions so I can ask you yes or no
[54:12] questions or how many questions so how
[54:14] many are mammals that's an okay question
[54:17] if I ask you what's the second what is
[54:19] the what is the second animal you that's
[54:21] not okay you can't you can't ask the
[54:23] Oracle for the answer but the Oracle
[54:26] always has to answer the same way so you
[54:28] say okay two of them are mammals and
[54:30] then somebody else asks how many live in
[54:32] the water and somebody else says you
[54:34] know whatever and the first person who
[54:35] can guess the three words but but just
[54:39] like a real seat phrase you have to have
[54:41] them in the correct order right so it's
[54:44] not just
[54:45] guessing what they are and if you take
[54:49] and so the and everyone of my games I
[54:50] always put like a little symbol of
[54:52] something down the corner to represent
[54:54] whatever the game is and so this one is
[54:55] the formula for the number number
[54:57] of uh number of options that represents
[55:00] so it turns out that with with three
[55:02] different cards out of 74 it was
[55:05] something like 388,000
[55:08] like ways to to organize it so it's
[55:10] you're not just going to guess
[55:11] it like um and you have to guess a lot
[55:16] yeah it's but it reminded me of what the
[55:17] way you started that out with you you
[55:19] have to guess the words and what's funny
[55:20] about it is the reason it's a fun game
[55:23] is it's not Technical and it r R is that
[55:26] we we don't know a lot about animals at
[55:28] least most people don't right they they
[55:31] like what is a mammal not a mammal you
[55:33] think these are very basic things but is
[55:35] someone will ask a question like one
[55:37] time it was uh like a bug you know the
[55:38] bug versus an insect kind of thing
[55:41] someone who's very technical knows that
[55:42] other people like they're all the same
[55:44] like whatever and this is so people you
[55:47] just laugh a lot at each other because
[55:49] you're like wait a minute you you told
[55:51] me that this one was this and they're
[55:52] like yeah and they're like no it isn't
[55:53] and they get into this argument about
[55:55] you know whatever whatever whatever it
[55:57] is so like one time um I don't remember
[56:00] if it was what it was someone asked how
[56:01] many have teeth and I think our our
[56:03] daughter was the Oracle at the time and
[56:05] she's like she had to go look it up on
[56:07] Google and everybody's looking at her
[56:08] going how do you know how do you not
[56:10] know they well one of the one it turns
[56:11] out one of the things was like it was
[56:13] some sea creature like a lobster or
[56:15] something and she had to look it up and
[56:17] or and then she's like yeah here it is I
[56:20] picture of it was like inside their
[56:21] stomach and gross and it was and so it
[56:23] was just completely nonsensical fun game
[56:28] um but then of course the educator in
[56:29] you comes out if you want to teach
[56:31] somebody about seed phrases you can tell
[56:35] them about what the list is what you
[56:37] know how you can get into all that the
[56:39] the technical stuff uh but when you
[56:41] describe putting three words into a bowl
[56:44] like that's this gamee is you pick three
[56:46] words you put them in order and
[56:47] everybody else has to guess it and
[56:48] that's it like that's the that's the
[56:50] only
[56:51] rules and it's uh it's it's much whereas
[56:55] like Channel up is based on lightning
[56:56] and that thing is it's not for the faint
[56:59] of heart that's that's more like Spock
[57:01] 3D chess kind of you know thing bip 39
[57:05] is more like
[57:07] Pictionary right and you just you know
[57:10] it's New Year's and you get a party of
[57:12] people together and you place your raids
[57:14] or Pictionary or something that's that's
[57:16] the level of difficulty for bip so is
[57:19] the Oracle inspired by by matrix no it's
[57:24] uh it the inspir ation for that came
[57:27] from I was when I was studying so when I
[57:30] I put all the my notes for that first
[57:32] game into the to a book Because I had
[57:35] like more ideas than I could put into
[57:36] the game I and I so I just put all my
[57:38] notes together and I put them in the
[57:39] book and it had to do with um it had to
[57:43] do something with um in the cipher world
[57:46] you know en
[57:47] coding uh it talked about um this idea
[57:50] of an Oracle and it was so hard for me I
[57:53] just couldn't get my head wrapped around
[57:55] it the the the concept that I remember
[57:58] was no matter who asks a question they
[58:00] always will answer that same question in
[58:02] the same way right so it's it's you know
[58:04] if you're arbitrating between two things
[58:07] if you and I were going to do a smart
[58:08] contract of some kind and maybe there's
[58:10] an oracle that says yeah the winner of
[58:11] the game is X and we agree that that is
[58:15] the decision point or that's the thing
[58:17] that gets to decide what the answer is
[58:19] um I'm doing a poor job of uh deciding
[58:21] it but to me it was it was something
[58:23] related to
[58:24] coding and
[58:26] and um it was it was sort of Cipher
[58:30] related and I don't I don't know the
[58:31] exact concept now uh I just stuck in the
[58:34] back of my head I'm like okay that's
[58:36] something that we should be kind of cool
[58:38] to teach and and I couldn't even Rock
[58:41] the whole concept and I was like but it
[58:43] it just sounded
[58:45] cool like well that sounded cool um I'll
[58:50] just put it in there you know just
[58:51] because if you're going to play a game
[58:53] like in Channel up the object of the
[58:55] game is to be the first first person to
[58:56] buy two pizzas with
[58:58] Bitcoin right there's when you when I'm
[59:00] looking at it when I'm thinking about
[59:02] what whatever concept it is that I want
[59:04] to teach in a game I'm trying to figure
[59:06] out something that just is not just who
[59:08] has the most points or who gets done
[59:10] first which is most games right whoever
[59:13] gets to X first or whoever gets the
[59:14] first amount of money or the most money
[59:16] at the end of the game they're all very
[59:18] similar and so whenever I can find
[59:20] something to mix it up a little bit with
[59:22] different words that might have
[59:24] different meanings or you know something
[59:26] else I try to I try to work that in
[59:28] there and that's what I did with the
[59:29] Oracle I don't fully understand the
[59:31] concept I've just heard it come up
[59:33] multiple times in in discussions like at
[59:36] bit devs and then I would say okay what
[59:39] where can I put that in a game I said
[59:41] okay I'm going to put it in this game
[59:42] here and I don't know there's there's
[59:45] not a lot to it I I wish i' you know now
[59:48] that now that we're talking about it I
[59:49] wish I would actually studied that
[59:50] because now I don't sound so smart about
[59:52] what an oracle is but um uh that's all
[59:56] it was just I heard it come up in
[59:57] Bitcoin discussions and I thought it'd
[59:59] be cool in a
[60:01] game it it it reminded me instantly of
[60:04] the Oracle of the Matrix because uh she
[60:07] also like uh gives some answers but not
[60:10] complete answers like you you ask her
[60:13] and you ask her and it's like yeah this
[60:15] and that but she never really like oh
[60:18] yeah that's how it is and she kind of
[60:20] like just puts you in the right
[60:22] direction okay I need to go back and
[60:24] rewatch that I re watched it recently
[60:27] because um today actually is the last
[60:31] day Matrix uh is featured uh on Netflix
[60:36] so the trilogy the originally first
[60:39] three three uh parts of Matrix uh will
[60:43] be this um how do you it this continued
[60:49] uh with tomorrow like today on the
[60:51] Bitcoin white paper day is the last day
[60:54] at The Matrix uh first three movies are
[60:57] on Netflix the the new one that I did
[61:00] not even see the that that was coming
[61:02] out 2021 that's some some kind of new
[61:05] one never watched it that is still on
[61:07] there but it's it's it's funny that it's
[61:09] exactly today why would they do that
[61:12] they must be available somewhere else I
[61:14] mean they're not
[61:15] gonna you can you can watch it anywhere
[61:17] on the internet just like put in Matrix
[61:20] watch free online you will find it it's
[61:22] it's probably illegal but but you can
[61:25] find it uh it's it's probably also
[61:27] somewhere on an an a legal platform you
[61:29] can definitely buy it on Amazon and
[61:31] stuff like that on Apple uh maybe even
[61:33] on YouTube you can buy it but yeah
[61:35] Netflix uh doesn't has it anymore I need
[61:38] to I need to I it all for all the talk
[61:40] of the Matrix in the Bitcoin Community I
[61:42] have not I have not watched that for
[61:44] years many years so let me I just need
[61:48] to go back sometime
[61:50] and rewatch that I have a weird problem
[61:53] about the Oracle thing that you're
[61:54] talking about till this discussion
[61:58] so I have a weird problem with Matrix
[62:00] watching because I always get motivated
[62:02] like I don't I don't know about you but
[62:05] when I watch
[62:06] Matrix um I watch it for like 15 minutes
[62:09] and I get crazy motivated and then I
[62:12] stop the movie and go work something
[62:14] it's like this this breaking out of the
[62:16] Matrix is such a big motivation for me
[62:18] in my head somehow uh that that it's
[62:21] it's crazy motivating for me I I had to
[62:23] watch the movie uh like one movie I have
[62:26] to watch like in three four times wow
[62:30] well that's pretty cool though if you
[62:31] have something that you can trigger
[62:32] motivation like
[62:35] that but sometimes I just want to watch
[62:37] a movie also did you see gu Swan's meme
[62:41] that he made out of the Matrix what what
[62:44] uh like it's a picture or like he made a
[62:46] video he made it into he was using so G
[62:49] Swan loves Ai and he was using Ai and he
[62:51] basically made this it's probably three
[62:54] to five minutes long thing about the
[62:56] Matrix but it but it had to do with
[62:58] Bitcoin like he switched the words
[63:00] around and stuff but still but he used
[63:02] AI to match the the the player or the um
[63:07] oh man if I try to find it now let see
[63:09] if I can go to his I I think I found it
[63:10] wait uh but if you if you like Matrix
[63:14] You're Gonna Love
[63:16] short he did a really really great job
[63:19] that let me I'm trying to convince him
[63:21] to come out to the adopting or to the is
[63:23] that that one from guys SW exit Fe and
[63:26] the Bitcoin a matrix meme hit hit play
[63:28] if you could let me see if it's the one
[63:29] I'm thinking of cuz I want I I don't
[63:31] know if there was is a
[63:35] system yeah that that's it yeah I think
[63:38] that's the right one oh man I have to
[63:41] watch
[63:42] it he did such a great job with that I
[63:44] was I was like wow a AI is amazing what
[63:48] you can do but um obviously he's he's a
[63:52] he loves story and he loves the Matrix
[63:53] and I think that is just uh I just
[63:57] thought that was a great it was just
[63:58] great so when you if you're already a
[64:00] matrix fan and you're a Bitcoin fan I
[64:03] think you're gonna I think you're G to
[64:05] like that short I will watch it later
[64:08] really cool I love it really cool well I
[64:11] have to admit that we're covering things
[64:13] I never expected to cover on
[64:16] a a podcast
[64:19] so H that's fine there's no way I was
[64:22] asking T can I prepare and she's like no
[64:24] you can't prepare he's going to ask you
[64:25] questions
[64:28] yes I I there are some uh some guests
[64:32] that want me to uh tell them the
[64:36] questions beforehand and I always say to
[64:38] them um tell me what you want to rant
[64:42] about and I will make sure it's in the
[64:44] podcast but I never give any questions
[64:47] beforehand I don't even give any
[64:49] structures beforehand uh and uh I I I
[64:53] like it that way I like having a conver
[64:55] ation and then having something there
[64:57] was like I think one two episodes where
[65:01] uh um where someone came in with a
[65:04] presentation and I looked for the
[65:06] presentation I was like oh that's
[65:07] seriously interesting like that's like
[65:09] uh he really thought about something
[65:11] here uh and funny enough that one guy
[65:14] with the presentation is actually my
[65:16] second uh uh or third uh best performing
[65:20] uh podcast ever uh so that was really
[65:23] good but usually it's just like I have a
[65:25] bunch of notes that I made usually I
[65:28] don't ask the notes but it's just like
[65:31] if there's a point where I don't know
[65:33] where to go then then I have that uh but
[65:36] usually like I have like 10 topics
[65:38] prepared or like maybe 11 uh that I
[65:42] could uh talk with that guest and after
[65:45] the second or third it's just a
[65:48] conversation then like it it's usually
[65:50] like the first 5 to 10 minutes which is
[65:52] like okay let's warm up and then it's
[65:54] just a conversation the same chogan says
[65:57] that all the time he's like he needs
[65:59] like the first 30 40 minutes to warm up
[66:02] and then it's just a conversation uh I I
[66:05] don't want to do four
[66:08] hours but but uh I like the one hour
[66:11] mark and we are yeah already over the
[66:13] one hour mark I just saw uh and it flew
[66:15] by and I like that kind of a style and I
[66:19] also like because like people on on
[66:22] social media like oh you have to Niche
[66:24] down you have to like really be in
[66:25] Bitcoin and I'm like if I have a Bitcoin
[66:28] podcast first of all like I I don't call
[66:31] the podcast Bitcoin podcast it's just
[66:33] like Robin S podcast I did that
[66:35] intentionally so uh I don't have to do a
[66:37] rebranding if Bitcoin is so successful
[66:40] uh that it's so boring that nobody wants
[66:42] to talk about it which will happen at
[66:44] some point uh and some point some days I
[66:49] just like don't talk about Bitcoin but
[66:51] it's rarely you know that's true I mean
[66:53] it's sort of like you're not gonna
[66:55] someone's not going to hang up a sign
[66:57] saying I do internet business you're
[66:59] like everybody just uses it right yes
[67:01] that's the point 1993 or something then
[67:04] like you would have been it would have
[67:05] been uh it would have been a different a
[67:08] different thing I I think you're smart
[67:10] to to do that we did not we went the
[67:12] other way when we when we were naming
[67:14] our our homeschooling
[67:17] podcast we there's already a lot of
[67:19] homeschooling podcasts out there and
[67:20] there's already a lot of Bitcoin out
[67:22] there and I was and I looked at what the
[67:24] Bitcoin veterans did
[67:26] and they just called it the Bitcoin
[67:27] veterans and I'm like well I know
[67:29] exactly what that show is like I don't
[67:31] have to I don't have to have a tagline
[67:32] to say the Robin S Show is X because the
[67:37] title was Bitcoin homeschoolers and like
[67:41] so we went the other way we just said
[67:43] let's make the name so specific um but
[67:47] the other hand I think we're you know
[67:48] we're going to look at you our long-term
[67:50] goal with that is to maybe T take our
[67:52] lessons learned from those uh interviews
[67:55] and and I rants if you will and maybe
[67:58] put them into a book or curriculum or
[68:00] something else so that's not something
[68:02] that we're going to do forever right the
[68:05] idea is let's let's let's let's collect
[68:07] some cool conversations we'll help
[68:09] people out with that and um we'll meet
[68:12] some new people in the process uh but we
[68:14] just we went the other direction we said
[68:16] we'll make the name exactly what it is
[68:19] so you don't have to ask what's that
[68:20] Bitcoin homeschooling podcast well it's
[68:22] the Bitcoin homeschoolers yeah okay but
[68:24] uh but yeah if you're going to do this
[68:25] for a long time I think uh I I think
[68:28] you're you're very forward thinking
[68:30] because I at some point we're going to
[68:32] reach that that point I think that's
[68:33] going to happen with conferences too
[68:36] because right now I don't see a lot of
[68:38] advertisements for people to say hey
[68:40] let's go to an internet conference right
[68:42] you're saying hey there's this great new
[68:43] technology it's going to change
[68:44] everything let's go you know to it so I
[68:46] think in in five or 10
[68:48] years we're not you don't you don't
[68:50] necessarily need these you don't need a
[68:52] conference every week for that's labeled
[68:55] bit coin and right now we're still on
[68:57] the increase like I I can't keep up with
[68:59] the it just feels like every like we
[69:01] just keep coming up with more and more
[69:03] conferences um which is cool because I
[69:05] like it's very it makes me bullish that
[69:07] there's so much interest but in five
[69:10] years and in 10 years like I just don't
[69:12] know if if adoption goes the way we
[69:14] expect it to go like do you need a whole
[69:16] conference on it you're already using it
[69:17] your business you're already using it
[69:20] personally the government will be using
[69:22] it the company like everybody will using
[69:23] it so you won't need it you won't need
[69:26] to label everything with it um it
[69:29] probably will go with like with the
[69:31] internet there's not an internet
[69:32] conference but there's like uh an an It
[69:36] security conference and there's like a
[69:38] video games conference where there's
[69:40] like a niche of that that's actually
[69:41] interesting and developing and then
[69:43] there's a a conference around that maybe
[69:45] that's how it works with Bitcoin yeah I
[69:47] think that that's exactly where it'll go
[69:49] you know and at that point then maybe
[69:51] the game conference will have a
[69:53] separate then maybe the game conference
[69:55] will come online but there won't be like
[69:58] a separate Bitcoin homeschooling
[70:00] conference because they already have
[70:02] homeschooling conferences will just be
[70:05] part of that that system or that Society
[70:10] or Community what that Community I guess
[70:13] will just become one piece of that uh
[70:15] other thing as opposed to a separate
[70:18] thing where we're on on an island but
[70:20] again I don't I think you're just really
[70:22] Forward Thinking I don't know I don't
[70:23] know if it takes I don't know if it
[70:24] takes a decade to get get there how long
[70:25] it takes us to get to that point um but
[70:28] it just makes sense that we'll
[70:29] eventually with adoption we'll get there
[70:32] if we don't have adoption then you won't
[70:34] you won't have them either for a
[70:35] different reason right so it's
[70:39] it's my photo was really simple uh
[70:42] because it started out out as the
[70:44] Bitcoin path podcast so like it actually
[70:46] started with with the Bitcoin branding
[70:48] uh but then uh I think after like a
[70:51] month or something like that I was like
[70:53] ah it's I don't want to do those
[70:55] rebrandings like uh there's so many repr
[70:58] I want to have one podcast that I do
[71:00] whole my life and and I decided to
[71:02] actually do this podcast till I die
[71:05] maybe not every day maybe the the
[71:07] frequency will will change uh along the
[71:10] years uh especially if I'm I'm getting
[71:12] like maybe 40 or 30 maybe I get kids or
[71:15] something like that then probably I
[71:16] don't know if it's if it's possible but
[71:18] anyways H I decided I want to do this
[71:21] podcast still a die and I know for sure
[71:25] Bitcoin will become boring before I die
[71:29] at some point I will talk about
[71:30] something else and I will have a
[71:32] different interest and then I want to
[71:33] talk about the the interest I have and
[71:36] not about Bitcoin anymore yeah it'll be
[71:38] interesting well I'm really glad you're
[71:39] gonna make it to the um to the
[71:41] unconference so if you if you have
[71:44] whatever that if you if you have a
[71:46] inkling of what that other interest
[71:47] might be you know in the post podcast
[71:50] life it's a great place to just test out
[71:52] ideas and just talk with people what
[71:55] whatever you know whatever is on your
[71:56] mind you literally can just say do
[71:57] anybody else want to talk about this and
[71:59] then I'll give you an example so
[72:01] t uh went up and she one with some other
[72:05] ladies and they basically said we want
[72:07] to talk about women for bit uh Bitcoin
[72:10] for women and we we don't like the way
[72:12] everybody talks the same kind of thing
[72:13] we just talked about earlier in the in
[72:15] this in this show um so they they went
[72:18] away and they were underneath like a
[72:20] tent or something because this the
[72:22] there's a big lawn area outside it's
[72:24] like an it's like a brew up in the
[72:25] mountains it's just beautiful and and U
[72:29] the women were gone for hours just
[72:31] talking and talking what came out of
[72:32] that is they decided T decided to do a
[72:35] women's
[72:36] retreat and so you never know what's
[72:38] going to come out of the discussions
[72:41] that you have there it's just it's just
[72:43] a really great environment I think
[72:44] you're going to really I'm really glad
[72:46] you're going to be able to make it um
[72:48] are you are you I'm curious though
[72:49] adopting are you one of the speakers do
[72:51] you have a uh yeah uh I don't know yet
[72:54] what I'm also not question for you I I
[72:57] wanted to see if you I wanted to know
[72:59] what you were going to speak on then so
[73:01] yeah I was at Bitcoin amster them
[73:03] actually on the main stage uh that that
[73:05] was my first ever um event where I spoke
[73:10] in front of an like inperson audience I
[73:13] never spoke about anything Bitcoin
[73:16] related in front of more than like 20
[73:18] people and there I was on the main stage
[73:20] with like I don't know 3,000 people or
[73:23] something like that and like a lot
[73:25] people also watching online that was
[73:27] something completely new and I actually
[73:31] moderated P I was not even a speaker I
[73:33] was like the moderator of of that panel
[73:36] uh and yeah I was with uh Chris Pinson
[73:40] there from coin shares I was from BR
[73:42] with Bram kin from uh the the Bitcoin
[73:45] from Millennials podcast uh and with
[73:48] Captain sit uh I was on the on on the
[73:50] panel and we talked about uh the the
[73:53] vision for Bitcoin in 2050 and and what
[73:57] we will expect there so a really
[73:59] interesting topic that I could talk
[74:01] about very long and why H this topic
[74:06] came up uh because as you said you want
[74:09] to do with the podcast something it's
[74:11] interesting I when I get invited to a
[74:14] podcast which also happened like I don't
[74:15] know 10 15 times already I get a lot ask
[74:19] like oh what did you learn from the
[74:20] podcast what like outstanding learnings
[74:22] from that because I do so many podcasts
[74:24] I'm coming up like three podcasts to go
[74:27] to the 300 podcast actually uh so far so
[74:31] uh I my biton knowledge like really grew
[74:34] massively in the last 11 12 months uh
[74:38] and people want to know like what are
[74:40] your learnings what are your future
[74:41] outlooks from that because I have so
[74:43] many bitcoiners talking to me and I
[74:46] gathered all my thoughts and
[74:48] Inspirations that I have from my own
[74:50] podcast just in like a very long Google
[74:53] Docs document that that I want to bring
[74:56] in like an article or block or some some
[75:00] kind of form that I just can give people
[75:02] as like a free PDF or something like
[75:04] that um if it's if it's really
[75:06] interesting maybe I make a book out of
[75:08] it uh but I even if I make a book out of
[75:10] it I just want to give it away for free
[75:13] as a PDF or maybe I make a newset I
[75:15] don't know what I do with it but at some
[75:17] form I want to do something with it and
[75:19] the guys from Bitcoin magazine oh ask me
[75:21] oh what what do you want to talk about
[75:23] and after reading my notes this was kind
[75:26] of the obvious topic out of that because
[75:28] I ask a lot the question how do you see
[75:30] Bitcoin and how do you uh see it in the
[75:33] future and what role it will play well I
[75:35] mean I guess I mean you could if you
[75:37] like that subject maybe that's what you
[75:38] talk about if you just have a you know
[75:40] block of time uh the one that the one
[75:43] that um so last year we did a
[75:46] presentation that talked about some of
[75:48] the stuff that was on that deck I shared
[75:50] with you um it was it was basically how
[75:53] to use Game Theory or
[75:55] how did I phrase it I forget the title
[75:57] of our thing last year we spoke but it
[76:00] was it was largely saying here's how we
[76:02] took these game elements and we put them
[76:03] into an actual game for you to play uh
[76:06] this year I'm going to talk on the the
[76:09] Paradox of free because in the Bitcoin
[76:12] space we talk about free and open source
[76:14] a lot and the the benefits of free and
[76:17] open source
[76:19] software so a couple places like open
[76:22] SATs block others they now have
[76:24] education grants right so the the
[76:27] unconference I just told you about is
[76:28] all about Educators and the if you want
[76:32] to go and if you if you want to become
[76:36] an educator I don't know I don't know
[76:38] what an official educator is I mean I
[76:40] think a podcaster is an educator I mean
[76:42] you're people who are watching this are
[76:44] probably getting something out of it I
[76:45] mean it's it's probably not just I don't
[76:47] think it's entertainment maybe it is for
[76:49] some but it's more like a learning thing
[76:53] but there's this this idea that uh at
[76:56] least maybe I was maybe it was just me
[76:58] but there was this idea that you had to
[77:00] everything has to be free and open
[77:03] source that that's the only way to do it
[77:05] and and I'm like yeah but I mean I'm not
[77:08] going to take my game and just give it
[77:09] away I mean that's we're trying to build
[77:11] a business around around that and so we
[77:15] you know I can't I mean I just I me I
[77:18] don't know I guess if you have a lot of
[77:19] Bitcoin that's your hobby and you could
[77:20] just give it away we're trying to make
[77:21] this this is our living and so I was
[77:24] like okay if I make a digital version of
[77:26] this thing what if I gave that away for
[77:27] free so I could keep the physical and
[77:30] then I could separate that and I went
[77:32] down this completely new rabbit hole for
[77:34] me about what does free and open source
[77:37] really
[77:38] mean and I don't think everybody has I
[77:40] don't think you could get two people to
[77:42] agree exactly on what it means some
[77:44] people is it should be free to other
[77:46] people some people should be um I can
[77:49] look at anything in the software so it
[77:50] doesn't control me I control it some
[77:52] people could be is free to use it's free
[77:55] to distribute free to sell not sell I
[77:57] mean there's like like a you just your
[77:59] head starts to spin with all these these
[78:02] nuances um but the idea is that it it
[78:05] takes a lot of work to build really good
[78:09] educational
[78:10] content right it's it's you're going to
[78:12] have to put in the proof of work to to
[78:13] make something that's
[78:15] worthwhile and it's not free your time
[78:18] if you invest your time to make a book
[78:20] or do whatever with your notes man that
[78:23] could take you years right years of
[78:25] podcasting years of noting years of
[78:28] putting that together and I come along
[78:30] and say yeah you should give away that
[78:31] for free and and some people will say
[78:32] like you like yeah I'm okay with that
[78:35] but like when you have a if you're doing
[78:37] a product or a service or something else
[78:40] you know how do you how do you reconcile
[78:41] how do you get people to come to a
[78:44] nonprofit and teach if they can't get
[78:47] paid that teaching isn't free right so
[78:51] the somebody has to make the materials
[78:53] that takes time someone has to teach the
[78:54] materials that takes time someone may
[78:56] have to Market it because other people
[78:58] may not even know they need it so who's
[79:00] going to do the marketing and so my my
[79:02] thought is free is not free free like
[79:06] that you if you're going to create value
[79:08] somebody is investing time and energy
[79:10] and and thought into that and so I'm
[79:14] trying to figure out how to package that
[79:17] all up and talk about it with other
[79:20] people at adopting Bitcoin so I'm still
[79:24] trying to figure out out that whole I'm
[79:26] still trying to figure out that whole
[79:27] thing but it's a rabbit hole that I went
[79:29] down this year and I wanted to share it
[79:31] with other people to to to kind of see
[79:35] if I hit a nerve with anybody you know
[79:38] on it so um because I know that there's
[79:40] a lot of people in the Bitcoin space a
[79:42] lot of entrepreneurs are trying to
[79:43] figure out how to follow their passion
[79:45] with Bitcoin and make a living you hit
[79:47] your 10,000
[79:48] subscribers like good on you but I don't
[79:51] know I don't think you're in the
[79:53] majority I think think I think a there's
[79:56] a lot there's a lot more people who are
[80:00] very very motivated to help other people
[80:03] in in Bitcoin and spread the word about
[80:05] Bitcoin that can't make a living off of
[80:07] that right it's not free to them they
[80:10] still have to pay their
[80:12] bills but they have this this desire and
[80:15] capabilities that they can help other
[80:17] people so how do you how do you bridge
[80:20] that how do you help the
[80:22] Educators you know do that depending on
[80:24] your Your Role are you a nonprofit are
[80:26] you a whale are you an educator what are
[80:28] you and so to me there's something there
[80:31] I haven't I haven't figured out the best
[80:33] framework for it yet um but that's what
[80:36] I'm going to talk about at adopting and
[80:38] um I'm not sure where it's going to go
[80:41] uh but that's what's peing my interest
[80:44] uh right now and so I made a proposal to
[80:48] talk about it and they said okay and I
[80:50] was like okay
[80:51] yeah I gotta go now I got to go build
[80:53] that
[80:55] so I don't what are your thoughts do you
[80:57] have any initial thoughts about I I love
[80:59] that a lot um and I
[81:03] mean
[81:04] monetizing uh you being an educator is
[81:08] really a challenge uh I mean there's
[81:11] like this traditional way of being a
[81:13] teacher
[81:14] obviously I I don't I don't like that
[81:17] too much uh but being an educator in
[81:20] online space because you have to give a
[81:23] lot for
[81:25] free um before you even have the
[81:30] authority of people trusting you what
[81:33] you have to say you know what I mean
[81:34] like like if you come out and and nobody
[81:37] knows you and you're like hey I have
[81:39] this this great course about
[81:41] Bitcoin um and then they're like oh but
[81:43] but but who are you uh so that's kind of
[81:46] like I think the initial problem with a
[81:49] lot of people um but I don't know like I
[81:52] I I had the privilege that I started it
[81:55] completely as a passion and I even when
[81:58] I started the podcast I didn't had the
[82:01] um f about making it monetizable it was
[82:05] only when then uh 21 Bitcoin came of
[82:09] came to me and like hey let's let's do
[82:10] something together and then I was like
[82:12] oh there's there's money in this podcast
[82:15] and it was not a lot uh but uh in in
[82:18] January I got the the first €2 200 from
[82:22] Twitter uh and I was like wait I I get
[82:25] paid for for for putting out my my my
[82:28] [ __ ] posts
[82:30] there so that was like oh there's like a
[82:33] business model and then I just like quit
[82:34] my job uh I didn't had enough uh income
[82:37] to cover all my expenses but I was like
[82:40] I will figure it out uh and yeah now I'm
[82:43] almost uh at the level that I was with
[82:45] my previous job so now it's really good
[82:49] uh but yeah I I definitely see that yeah
[82:53] so it's
[82:54] yeah it's it's it's good to hear people
[82:56] who have got that have made it to that
[82:59] to that it's not a lot like it's it's
[83:00] it's really uh because I think a lot of
[83:03] people underestimate the the amount of
[83:05] work the that actually has to go to like
[83:08] I since uh basically like before I
[83:12] started full-time I worked full-time at
[83:15] another company and like nothing to do
[83:18] with Bitcoin with it security and I
[83:20] dedicated still every day at least two
[83:23] hours to build my Twitter to build an
[83:26] online presence so this was like one
[83:29] whole year of two hours per day
[83:31] completely
[83:32] unpaid I did it partially because I
[83:36] wanted to build uh an audience I wanted
[83:38] to build uh an an following and and
[83:41] wanted to be a bigger part of the
[83:43] Bitcoin Community but I also did it
[83:45] because I really L Bitcoin and L the
[83:47] interaction with it like both were
[83:48] melting really nicely together it didn't
[83:50] felt like work and because it was not my
[83:53] income it there was also no pressure it
[83:55] was really nice uh and then there was
[83:58] this point where all of the sudden saw
[84:00] like oh there's like act money in there
[84:02] uh then I really started to work like 60
[84:05] 70 hours per week uh on on like oh how
[84:08] do I build a podcast like how do how do
[84:11] I do that like there are so many
[84:13] podcasts out there there are also so
[84:14] many Bitcoin podcasts out there it's not
[84:16] that easy to like like I'm here oh all
[84:18] of the sudden you have 11,000
[84:21] subscribers so there's a lot of work in
[84:23] there and
[84:24] uh there's like this statistic of
[84:26] podcasts that like 97% quit within the
[84:30] first three episodes uh and from the
[84:33] three 3% that are still there uh uh only
[84:37] 1% makes it then to the 20th episode and
[84:41] there are not too many regular podcasts
[84:43] out there that put actually every week
[84:46] or every month and like me every day
[84:48] there's very very rarely people out
[84:51] there that do that that's a beautiful
[84:53] lesson though I mean that that to
[84:55] me would be something that other people
[84:58] would be inspired to hear right because
[85:02] he said listen it wasn't it wasn't that
[85:04] I was a super genius it was that I was
[85:09] consistent and once I committed I didn't
[85:12] stop I said I'm going to keep on doing
[85:14] this I'm going to do this every day you
[85:16] said until you rest of your life uh most
[85:18] people won't make that big a commitment
[85:21] but the I think that's a beautiful thing
[85:23] and it could actually inspire people who
[85:25] are um I know T and I have I mean we
[85:28] we've we have that uh what they call it
[85:30] like the what do they call it the um the
[85:33] good idea fairy type of thing you have
[85:34] so many ideas like you just you don't
[85:38] focus on the one thing and and move it
[85:40] across the finish line and so we have a
[85:44] ton of ideas that we want in our
[85:46] podcast and we we just we've been
[85:49] balancing our things and we're saying
[85:50] okay well we're going to have to delay
[85:52] this because we have this whatever it is
[85:54] like just things are constantly moving
[85:57] and what that does is we don't do what
[86:00] you did we we've lost some of our it's
[86:03] sort of like stopping going to the gym
[86:04] for a period if you if you miss one day
[86:07] it's it's not that difficult to get back
[86:09] to the gym in there if you've missed two
[86:12] days it's a little bit more hard if
[86:13] you've missed a full week you basically
[86:15] have a new habit right so if you have a
[86:19] new podcast or a blog or whatever it is
[86:22] that you do and you start out really
[86:23] really strong because you're motivated
[86:26] you have to work past that that period
[86:29] when the resistance like when you you
[86:31] miss a day or you miss whatever it is
[86:33] that you're producing and so your story
[86:36] that you work through that and you're
[86:37] now at almost
[86:39] 300 like that's you're basically you
[86:42] could give someone inspiration I think
[86:43] you could inspire people sharing that so
[86:46] maybe you consider I'm just
[86:48] brainstorming with you
[86:50] consider sharing your story that maybe
[86:54] hey guys look here's some things that I
[86:57] learned on my journey and I and I hope
[86:59] that these lessons will help you as well
[87:01] because I that to me is inspirational
[87:03] when I hear like someone who's done gone
[87:05] through that it feels like a big deal to
[87:06] me to do that I don't know it
[87:09] maybe that's the kind of thing I want to
[87:11] teach my
[87:12] kids say hey guys look at look what
[87:14] Robin did he said I'm gonna do this and
[87:17] he committed to it and he did it for 300
[87:19] episodes straight and saying you guys
[87:20] want to start your own show or your own
[87:23] channel your own Channel Whatever It Is
[87:26] Nothing Stops you because you can
[87:28] anybody can record with their phone and
[87:31] and and do whatever you want there so I
[87:35] that's I'm just brainstorming with you I
[87:36] don't want to pressure you but I I think
[87:38] that would be pretty cool I share with
[87:39] you the link in the chat the thing that
[87:41] led me when I was going down this Rabbit
[87:43] Hole to to basically say okay we're
[87:47] making these physical games free market
[87:49] kids like Channel up and the stuff that
[87:51] we've been talking about but if I want
[87:52] to if I want to do the educ
[87:54] impact I need to
[87:57] remove the supply chain frictions that
[88:00] are there right so it costs a lot of
[88:02] money to send a game to Austria and you
[88:05] probably have import duties and it's
[88:08] going to cost you more to get the game
[88:11] than it would I mean more in the duties
[88:14] and taxes and shipping than just the
[88:15] game itself right and I said okay I want
[88:19] to keep playing I want to keep playing
[88:20] with the the games because I I think
[88:22] they're they're good but imagine that um
[88:26] imagine we took just a digital version
[88:29] and we made that piece free in open
[88:31] source right and we gave that away free
[88:33] what would that look like and and so
[88:35] then someone said well you can go get
[88:37] grants I said I don't I don't know the
[88:39] process to get grants well here's what
[88:42] you got to go and then the the grants
[88:43] would say well you're you don't have a
[88:45] project so then I go and say okay I'll
[88:46] start a project and they say you need to
[88:48] have a free and open source license I'm
[88:50] like what what the hell what a license
[88:53] what like I just I was like so this was
[88:56] my journey that this was the the I'm
[88:59] still on it that inspired can I get
[89:02] somebody else
[89:04] to help me from an in like a grant
[89:08] standpoint take it's just the first
[89:10] project get huddle up in a digital
[89:11] format because now I can get it to
[89:14] anywhere in the world we can translate
[89:16] to other languages we build it on Noster
[89:18] or maybe whole punch or some other
[89:20] Freedom type technology and we can link
[89:23] educational m material to it in any
[89:25] language and now I've
[89:27] introduced um I've introduced you to
[89:29] Freedom Tech even if you don't want it
[89:31] someone could zap you things or you get
[89:32] rewards on the on Lightning I just the
[89:34] potential impact for adoption to me is
[89:38] huge and I I just wanted to have a
[89:41] separation between that and our and our
[89:43] other business but it hasn't been easy
[89:45] trying to figure this out which is which
[89:48] is what inspired me to to do that topic
[89:51] at adopting so I'm still on it I don't
[89:53] have a solution for it but this
[89:55] is that's that's the one of the next
[89:58] steps in our journey is to try to figure
[90:00] that out because I think I think the
[90:02] impact from an education standpoint
[90:05] that's why I don't consider it just a
[90:06] gaming company I think our our company
[90:08] is more our mission is is so much bigger
[90:11] than that and this would extend our our
[90:15] impact exponentially but I'm trying to
[90:16] figure out how to do it you're trying to
[90:19] like it's not free right it's going to
[90:21] take time you have development work in
[90:23] there you're GNA have marketing work
[90:25] even if we give it away to somebody for
[90:26] free creating it is not free and and and
[90:31] executing on that plan is not free and
[90:34] there there's no free lunch no and so
[90:37] that's what I thought then um the other
[90:38] thing that came to mind I don't know if
[90:40] you do a lot of reading but I um have
[90:42] you read any like iron Rand like Atlas
[90:45] Shrugged kind of oh iron Rand uh no no
[90:48] okay there's an expression in in that
[90:50] book that says if you think there's a
[90:52] contradiction check your premises and
[90:54] you'll find that one of them is wrong I
[90:57] but okay so here I am with this free not
[91:00] free kind of thing going on my head I'm
[91:02] like I how do I resolve this because
[91:04] it's not a contradiction if you create
[91:06] value of course that takes work like
[91:09] that's not a that's not a contradiction
[91:12] in there so I'm just but we're in an
[91:15] ethos we're in a in a community that
[91:17] values giving away things for free
[91:20] you're you have a free Channel you have
[91:21] a free book you have a free app whatever
[91:24] it is and it's like okay well how do I I
[91:29] have something of value how do I get it
[91:30] out there and it's it's not going to be
[91:33] it's going to cost me a lot of time to
[91:35] make this work but the impact is
[91:38] huge and so you know if it helps with
[91:41] adoption then it helps with all
[91:43] bitcoiners so anyway it's a it's a I'm
[91:47] I'm really looking forward to the the El
[91:48] Salvador discussions because it's um
[91:52] there it's just fun to kind of think
[91:53] through how to get how to work through
[91:55] these things and um every time we this
[91:57] is like everything else we've gone
[91:58] through it's it's it's just one more
[92:00] step and we have to work through it and
[92:03] figure it out
[92:05] so absolutely uh there there's so much
[92:09] in there um as we
[92:12] already very over the time um not over
[92:16] the time because there's not really an
[92:17] overtime but we already over one and a
[92:20] half hours which actually rarely happens
[92:23] um which speaks I think to to the to the
[92:26] quality and to the great conversation
[92:28] that we had today so thank you so much
[92:29] already for that I usually asked every
[92:31] one of my guests what can we learn from
[92:33] you besides Bitcoin but we I think we
[92:35] covered a lot of the game side of things
[92:36] and uh things that you would have
[92:38] probably told in that that answer that
[92:41] so like I think we can we can skip that
[92:43] today h but we have an end in the
[92:45] podcast where the previous guest is
[92:47] asking a question for the next guest
[92:49] without knowing who the next guest
[92:50] actually is um and uh the previous guest
[92:55] asked what do you think drives Michael
[92:58] sailor to be so bullish on bitcoin so I
[93:01] don't oh wow uh Michael sailor getting
[93:04] inside of his head
[93:07] um he he's very
[93:09] confident again I don't know him
[93:11] personally so I'm just going to you
[93:13] speculate he's someone who is a very
[93:15] very first
[93:17] principled type of person and once you
[93:21] give him the math proof that something
[93:24] works then he his in his mind that's the
[93:28] end of the discussion and you you just
[93:30] do it and I I I he he went through he's
[93:35] described it many times publicly what
[93:36] his thought process was that Led Led to
[93:39] that but what I I'm almost imagining a
[93:42] student doing a math proof and once they
[93:44] get done with the proof that this
[93:45] formula works you don't have to keep
[93:48] going you can just use the formula right
[93:51] so I think the thing that drives him is
[93:54] he did his
[93:55] homework the and the and the proof was
[93:59] there the and I say mathematical proof
[94:01] I'm not talking about like proof of work
[94:02] I'm just talking about a mathematical
[94:04] proof he said okay this is we've checked
[94:07] everything we've done this thing we've
[94:08] proved that this this this
[94:10] works that's it we're going to go do it
[94:14] and then from there his his proof was
[94:17] correct and now as it plays out it just
[94:20] reinforced that his proof was correct
[94:23] and now you have other people who are
[94:24] are starting to catch on to to what he's
[94:27] he's doing but I I think he would he was
[94:29] willing to do that whether he ever went
[94:31] on a podcast or not he was willing to do
[94:33] that whether he ever had his name in the
[94:35] paper or anything else and so I think
[94:37] the thing that drives him around Bitcoin
[94:39] is he just believes that
[94:41] it's it is it's the right thing he's
[94:43] checked all the bases he's gone as deep
[94:45] as he could possibly go deep what uh
[94:47] death wise and it's just a first
[94:48] principle he says this makes sense and I
[94:52] don't I don't think he it doesn't look
[94:54] like it's any more complicated than that
[94:56] so if it if this makes sense we're going
[94:58] to go do it and if you want to disagree
[95:00] with me fine we'll go we can go argue
[95:01] about it or not I'm still gon to go do
[95:03] what I'm gonna go
[95:04] do so um I don't think he um I don't
[95:08] think he cares now if someone else
[95:10] disagrees with
[95:12] him it's super interesting also like
[95:15] what his greater goals uh uh uh someone
[95:18] said to me he will for sure run for
[95:21] president one day I'm like yeah I would
[95:24] love that uh but yeah like uh the it's
[95:27] it's F because I I asked him that on my
[95:29] podcast when he was on on my podcast um
[95:33] uh what Bitcoin did to him and he said
[95:36] uh Bitcoin gave me a second life like he
[95:38] was like he said he was ready to retire
[95:41] he was ready to uh because like he's no
[95:44] no longer the CEO and that plan was
[95:48] beginning before he even got to bitcoin
[95:51] that he really retire as a CEO that's
[95:52] like a fiveyear BL that he he built uh
[95:55] so he was kind of like in the in the
[95:59] movement of retiring and and laying a
[96:02] little back in life and and he said
[96:04] Bitcoin gave him a second life a second
[96:06] passion something uh to pursue uh after
[96:10] micro strategy and I think that's that's
[96:13] that's really that that was a nice small
[96:16] small thing that that he shared there
[96:17] with with us and yeah it's it's it's
[96:21] pretty fascinating to to see this this
[96:23] this guy doing what he he does but yeah
[96:26] it's I like it a lot I um I suppose I'm
[96:29] supposed to come up with a question then
[96:30] for you for the next guest or we do that
[96:32] privately you know we we usually do it
[96:34] privately uh but you can give it right
[96:37] now also if you if you want no I'm
[96:39] actually trying to think of one I'm like
[96:41] okay now now I feel pressured I gotta
[96:43] go I gotta come up with something good
[96:46] so perfect then uh that then let's end
