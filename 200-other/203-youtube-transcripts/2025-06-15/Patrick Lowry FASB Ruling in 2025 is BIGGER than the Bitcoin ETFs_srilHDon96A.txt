[00:00] we deploy to funds and anything that we
[00:02] do not have deployed to funds we hold in
[00:04] Bitcoin every year it takes a couple of
[00:07] months of consolidation post the having
[00:09] before we really start to see that
[00:10] bitcoin price truly rip and reach new
[00:13] all-time high for me the fb's ruling
[00:15] that Bitcoin on balance sheets can be
[00:18] fair valued and should be fair valued
[00:20] that was bigger news than the Bitcoin
[00:23] ETF was companies starting January 1st
[00:26] 2025 will be able to fair value Bitcoin
[00:28] How likely is it that Microsoft actually
[00:30] goes ahead and buys Bitcoin in the next
[00:32] year it's already 100% guarantee and I
[00:34] base that almost exclusively on Black
[00:37] Rock owning something like 9 to 10%
[00:39] which means that at the actual
[00:41] shareholder meeting the proxy vote
[00:42] they're probably going to end up being a
[00:44] substantial amount of the voting guess
[00:46] what instrument they're probably going
[00:47] to use at Microsoft to buy and hold
[00:50] Bitcoin probably going to be that
[00:51] magical Black Rock ETF the Microsoft CTO
[00:54] said I don't know why I hadn't thought
[00:57] of it before but Bitcoin is an
[00:59] incredible power concept and I don't
[01:01] think we have fully crafted what it
[01:02] could mean for society if I'm a small
[01:05] public company and I see that Microsoft
[01:07] is clearly planning something around
[01:10] Bitcoin I look at this and I go yeah you
[01:12] know what it is an inevitability that
[01:14] Microsoft will be buying Bitcoin and
[01:16] they're huge so maybe they could do
[01:18] something like a sailor Playbook maybe I
[01:20] should be rethinking my corporate
[01:22] treasury strategy and if I can front run
[01:24] Microsoft and I can acquire a few
[01:26] hundred maybe a couple thousand Bitcoin
[01:28] that might not be a bad idea everybody
[01:29] body should be holding Bitcoin on their
[01:31] balance sheets and anything that doesn't
[01:32] need to be used for operations should be
[01:34] in
[01:35] [Music]
[01:39] Bitcoin before we get started with the
[01:41] topic I think today it's the is one of
[01:43] the days where context might be
[01:45] interesting uh so like uh really quick
[01:48] like what are you doing with Samara what
[01:50] is the company doing and what is kind of
[01:53] the the vision there yeah so I mean
[01:55] Samar asset group is a publicly traded
[01:57] company um it's based out of Malta uh
[02:00] but it's listed in Germany um it
[02:02] actually used to go by the brand
[02:04] cryptology asset group uh the company
[02:07] was founded by um German serial
[02:09] entrepreneur and investor uh Christian
[02:10] angamer as well as uh Mike novogratz um
[02:14] of Galaxy fam I don't think I need to
[02:15] tell anybody on your channel who Novo is
[02:17] right um now the company was initially
[02:20] intended to be this Merchant Bank for
[02:22] all things crypto um you probably
[02:24] remember back in 2018 when the company
[02:26] was founded uh Malta was really pushing
[02:28] this blockchain island thing um at the
[02:31] time and they were trying to have
[02:32] friendly regulation um they were really
[02:35] trying to push friendly um Banking and
[02:37] compliance uh for crypto companies
[02:39] particularly the exchanges I mean and
[02:41] basically uh how that went is the ECB
[02:43] just looked at the island and said the
[02:45]  you are um and basically got
[02:47] everything Malta was trying to do killed
[02:49] right um so they weren't ever able to
[02:52] really establish cryptology as this
[02:55] Merchant Bank uh the way that they had
[02:57] initially envisioned but what happened
[02:59] happened is uh cryptology invested in a
[03:02] handful of companies that were building
[03:04] in the Bitcoin and the blockchain space
[03:07] um one of which was actually my company
[03:09] at the time uh I didn't found uh Samara
[03:12] or cryptology I only joined as CEO in
[03:15] January um or rather February of 2021 I
[03:18] think um but Samar invested in my
[03:21] company Deutsche digital assets uh we
[03:24] were one of the first ETP issuers uh on
[03:26] a regulated Marketplace anywhere in the
[03:28] world for Bitcoin eum and other uh
[03:31] financial instruments um so really proud
[03:33] we were able to be one of the first
[03:34] pioneers there uh here in Europe but
[03:38] when I stepped into
[03:40] Samara um the balance sheet of the
[03:42] company had absolutely ballooned I mean
[03:44] we were invested in companies like block
[03:46] one who regardless of how you feel about
[03:48] the EOS token sale if you were an equity
[03:50] holder of block one um I mean at one
[03:52] point they had more Bitcoin than God so
[03:55] it was a pretty good Equity investment
[03:57] right um You also we also had Northern
[04:00] data uh one of Europe's largest Bitcoin
[04:02] Miners and now one of the main players
[04:04] um in the AI data management space so
[04:07] that investment has performed really
[04:09] well so the balance sheet grew pretty
[04:12] substantially and when I stepped in in
[04:15] 21 um I told our investment committee
[04:18] look we can have there's one of two ways
[04:20] we can do this number one we can
[04:23] leverage our at that point damn near
[04:25] half a billion Euro balance sheet and we
[04:27] can continue to deploy to early stage AG
[04:30] companies in the Bitcoin and the
[04:31] blockchain space um but to do that I'm
[04:34] going to need an army of analysts um I
[04:36] mean if you're investing uh on the
[04:38] Venture side of things in crypto there's
[04:41] a thousand deals to look at every year
[04:45] um it's very difficult to Cipher through
[04:47] what the deals are that are truly
[04:50] worthwhile um I mean as you know uh
[04:53] there's a lot of scams there's a lot of
[04:55] nonsense in crypto and I mean even for
[04:57] any one company or any 10 companies a
[04:59] venture group invests in maybe only one
[05:02] or two pan out so I told them we can
[05:04] take that route and I'm going to have to
[05:06] build out a huge Workforce for Samara um
[05:09] or we should start deploying to managers
[05:12] themselves um rather instead of
[05:14] deploying directly off of our own
[05:16] balance sheets into the companies which
[05:18] is historically what Samara has been
[05:19] doing uh we deploy to managers we deploy
[05:23] to funds and anything that we do not
[05:25] have deployed to funds we hold in
[05:27] Bitcoin as our primary treasury Reserve
[05:29] asset so that's basically been our
[05:31] strategy uh for the last let's say two
[05:34] and a half three years ever since I
[05:35] stepped in uh we've been able to
[05:37] liquidate a lot of the Legacy
[05:39] Investments That cryptology asset group
[05:42] had made over the last couple of years
[05:44] and through that liquidation we've been
[05:46] able to stack um a decent amount of
[05:48] Bitcoin I still obviously want to own
[05:50] substantially more um even 21 even 20
[05:53] million Bitcoin on my balance sheet
[05:54] won't be enough for me um but we've also
[05:57] been deploying to a lot of fund managers
[05:59] over that period of time I think at this
[06:01] moment we now have 19 different fund
[06:05] Investments which give Samara asset
[06:07] group uh in direct exposure to the
[06:10] performance of over 700 portfolio
[06:12] companies so we have a very Diversified
[06:15] um uh very robust balance sheet and
[06:19] basically we're offering our
[06:21] shareholders the opportunity to
[06:22] participate in the performance of that
[06:24] 700 plus companies and of course Bitcoin
[06:28] uh merely just by being shareholders of
[06:31] the company itself interesting so like
[06:33] you are holding as a treasury Reserve
[06:35] asset Bitcoin but you're investing in a
[06:38] broad spectrum of companies with the
[06:41] with your company exactly so I mean we
[06:44] have so we're not necessarily investing
[06:46] in companies like I said um the company
[06:48] historically had done that when it was
[06:50] cryptology asset group now we're largely
[06:53] deploying to funds and funds of course
[06:55] largely deploy to Ventures and to
[06:57] companies but some of them are liquid
[06:59] hedge funds right um so through that we
[07:01] have exposure to uh over 700 portfolio
[07:05] companies plus I mean I think we have as
[07:08] of right now roughly 421 Bitcoin on our
[07:11] balance sheet um okay so it's either
[07:13] four and 21 or four plus 21 I don't know
[07:16] whichever one 420 and one whichever one
[07:18] you want to call it right yeah four
[07:21] 420 would be the perfect number
[07:26] exactly2 420 and one yeah really cool um
[07:30] you also mentioned that the ECB fighted
[07:32] down the the malta project of having
[07:35] this blockchain uh Island um do you
[07:38] still feel that the ecps is is fighting
[07:41] Bitcoin uh and the ecosystem do you feel
[07:43] like that that that's still happening on
[07:45] a big sense oh did you see the I mean so
[07:47] as of this recording we're recording
[07:49] this on what Monday October 28th did you
[07:51] see the article from Forbes that just
[07:53] came out today uh so Forbes put out an
[07:56] article i' forget if it was today or
[07:57] maybe it was over the weekend and I only
[07:59] just saw it today coming back from
[08:00] Lugano um they put out an article that
[08:04] the ECB and the FED intend to be
[08:06] completely weaponized against Bitcoin
[08:08] and they want to do so either through
[08:10] outright bans or ridiculous taxation um
[08:14] and this comes on the heels of uh Italy
[08:17] increasing its tax on bitcoin from what
[08:20] 26 to 42% I think they announced they're
[08:22] planning on doing um so I wouldn't be
[08:25] the least bit surprised to see taxation
[08:27] become a weapon that has ended up using
[08:29] used by governments like I mean these
[08:32] are supposed to be independent agencies
[08:34] but the ECB and the SEC are and every
[08:37] three-letter agency is completely
[08:39] captured by the government at this point
[08:40] in time um so they will be weaponized
[08:43] against uh Bitcoin and supposedly
[08:45] they're going to try to do this to pay
[08:47] off the trillions upon trillions of
[08:49] dollars of debt that they've racked up
[08:51] over the last couple of years which is
[08:53] really just kind of funny um it just
[08:55] shows how frankly forgive my French but
[08:58] how absolutely r harded the ECB and the
[09:00] SEC are they could just buy and hold
[09:03] Bitcoin and be able to pay it off um any
[09:05] debts that they have in their entirety
[09:08] over the coming years and I think that's
[09:11] part of the strategy for instance that
[09:12] Donald Trump is planning on employing as
[09:14] he wants to have a Bitcoin treasury
[09:17] reserve it was Senator Lumis that first
[09:19] brought this legislation forward um
[09:22] using that uh using uh Reserve assets at
[09:26] the US government uh to purchase Bitcoin
[09:28] as a part of aate IC reserve the same
[09:30] thing we do with every other commodity
[09:32] we have a strategic oil Reserve or
[09:35] rather I should say we did until Joe
[09:36] Biden and his ilk um completely
[09:38] destroyed it just to make pretend that
[09:41] the economy was actually still going and
[09:43] that inflation wasn't bad by keeping the
[09:45] price of oil down um but yeah uh that
[09:50] probably will one day be used as
[09:53] leverage or used as assets to pay off
[09:55] the massive amount of debt that the US
[09:58] government has taken on
[09:59] um by
[10:01] irresponsibly printing trillions upon
[10:04] trillions of dollars and I wouldn't be
[10:06] surprised to see the ECB do something
[10:07] similar interesting how important do you
[10:09] think it is uh the question of who will
[10:12] be the next president of the US as the
[10:16] as they have some saying in in the ECP
[10:19] in the in the FED also that I think that
[10:22] it's quite an important role how
[10:24] important do you think is is that for
[10:26] for Bitcoin who the next president will
[10:28] be I I think it's incredibly important
[10:31] um I mean and you have to remember so
[10:34] okay so you have the two primary
[10:35] candidates Donald Trump and kamla Harris
[10:37] right uh Trump historically uh hated
[10:40] Bitcoin in 2016 when he was elected and
[10:44] the four years afterwards uh that he was
[10:46] the president he did absolutely nothing
[10:49] um to push for Bitcoin adoption he
[10:51] called it a Ponzi I mean he was really a
[10:53] part of the uh mechanism that tried to
[10:56] suppress Bitcoin so we can't entirely
[10:58] forget and forget what Donald Trump did
[11:01] with Bitcoin right on the flip side
[11:04] though Donald never necessarily
[11:07] weaponized any Administration against
[11:10] Bitcoin um he at least as far as we're
[11:14] aware we have not seen or we at least at
[11:17] that point in time didn't necessarily
[11:18] see the
[11:20] SEC as weaponized against Bitcoin and
[11:22] crypto as it was of course there were
[11:24] some uh Wells notices put out of course
[11:27] we didn't get the Bitcoin ETF during
[11:29] that period of time but nowhere in the
[11:31] world had a Bitcoin ETF ETP um that was
[11:35] traded on a regulated Marketplace there
[11:36] were a couple unregulated um
[11:39] marketplaces that had etps in Europe for
[11:41] a couple of years but nothing that
[11:43] actually had a formal approved
[11:45] perspectus to be listed on a regulated
[11:48] Marketplace um so I'm not going to be
[11:50] too critical then because maybe they
[11:52] just didn't want the US to be the first
[11:54] mover to do something like that um but
[11:57] the last four years the the Biden and
[12:00] Harris Administration they have
[12:02] objectively weaponized every
[12:05] three-letter agency they possibly could
[12:07] against Bitcoin against crypto and I
[12:11] mean you saw Trump come out earlier this
[12:13] year late last year as being a huge
[12:16] advocate for Bitcoin
[12:18] adoption I think the primary reason this
[12:21] happened is VI ramaswami uh got to him
[12:25] right um VC was uh part of the primaries
[12:28] for the Republican party before he
[12:31] decided to step out and endorse Donald
[12:33] Trump and I think a big part of that was
[12:35] is that Bitcoin um is something that's a
[12:38] core thesis for Vi um he is very anti-
[12:42] cbdc uh he sees cbdc as the absolute
[12:45] utmost tyrannical Financial instrument
[12:49] for globalist communism so I think that
[12:54] messaging resonated with Donald Trump
[12:56] and allowed him to finally I hope
[12:59] see the light on bitcoin and also be
[13:02] come out very much against
[13:04] cbdcs
[13:06] now is does he actually believe in
[13:08] Bitcoin is he really truly against cbdcs
[13:12] I don't know I never trust a single
[13:14] thing that politicians necessarily say
[13:16] during election Cycles they'll say
[13:17] whatever they can to get elected and
[13:19] that to a certain extent is what I think
[13:21] he is doing but with that said if he
[13:23] follows through clearly Bitcoin and
[13:26] crypto will be in an infinitely better
[13:28] place than than what we've been under
[13:30] for the last four years of the Biden and
[13:32] Harris
[13:33] Administration so but if I were to play
[13:36] Devil's Advocate um you can largely say
[13:38] the same thing of um Kamala Harris
[13:41] because for instance over the last I
[13:43] mean again you can't necessarily trust a
[13:45] politician with anything that they've
[13:46] been saying um during the election cycle
[13:49] but at least over the last couple of
[13:51] months Kamala has come out and she has
[13:54] said that she will work with Bitcoin or
[13:56] she will work with Congress to pass
[13:59] Bitcoin uh legislation crypto regulation
[14:02] and really try to roll that back however
[14:05] my whole thing is if you are in charge
[14:08] right now and don't get me wrong she is
[14:10] the literal vice president of the
[14:12] country at this moment in time and has
[14:14] been for the last three and a half
[14:16] nearly four years why the haven't
[14:19] you done anything then you could have
[14:21] changed this if you wanted to so do I
[14:24] think Donald Trump is necessarily A
[14:27] bitcoiner there's it's I would probably
[14:29] say more so than uh more so yes than no
[14:33] but do I trust KLA Harris at all is
[14:36] going to do anything positive for
[14:38] Bitcoin and not just lie like she has
[14:40] been about everything that she's
[14:41] planning on changing relative to all the
[14:44] policies that her and Biden have enacted
[14:46] over the last four years I don't trust
[14:48] that at all um I think she's just saying
[14:50] that to try to capture moderate votes or
[14:52] to get some votes away um from the Trump
[14:55] momentum train uh within the Bitcoin and
[14:57] the crypto industry but we'll we'll see
[15:00] how it shakes out um I mean I've never
[15:03] voted for Donald Trump at all over the
[15:05] last couple of years I'm a Libertarian
[15:07] I've always voted libertarian this time
[15:09] around though I will be voting for
[15:11] Donald Trump uh I'm a one-issue voter
[15:13] and this is I think one of the most
[15:15] important voting topics uh what will
[15:18] happen with Bitcoin and crypto
[15:19] regulation moving forward so I have to
[15:22] in the great state of Pennsylvania cast
[15:23] my vote for Donald Trump it's it's
[15:25] really interesting uh to see this this
[15:29] whole election cycle last election cycle
[15:31] and I not did not really uh follow I was
[15:35] not really interested obviously I'm
[15:36] austan I'm EU citizens are like
[15:39] um it's hard for me to really care
[15:41] what's going on with America but right
[15:43] now I'm really like I'm I'm I'm watching
[15:46] more American uh election things than
[15:48] Austrian election things because I'm
[15:50] yeah it's it's that has a bigger impact
[15:52] on on bitcoin overall even though
[15:54] Austria politics uh directly point to me
[15:59] more but it's interesting for me Trump
[16:01] when I hear him speak and when I hear
[16:03] what he does and what he he does in
[16:05] Bitcoin I'm like okay he gets it
[16:07] probably like one two% yeah uh if like
[16:10] the the elite is getting it like 80%
[16:13] saying like sailor Cy and jef Po and all
[16:16] those people get it like maybe 80%
[16:18] because I think nobody is at 100% uh
[16:21] Trump has maybe some few per but I think
[16:23] he really trusts in VC in RFK and what
[16:27] they are saying uh to him and they get
[16:29] it way more you can see it in the in the
[16:31] in the speech also was RFK gave in
[16:34] Bitcoin magazine that that was a really
[16:35] good one he really hit home some some
[16:38] really good points so I think uh that's
[16:41] that that that's great that he has
[16:44] people in his administration and in his
[16:47] uh Circle who actually understand
[16:49] Bitcoin and that's a really positive
[16:51] thing if it would only be Trump I would
[16:53] be more more skeptical but there are
[16:56] really good people behind him I mean
[16:57] that's a very fair point you have to
[16:59] look I mean we always think of the
[17:01] presidential elections as really just
[17:04] electing one guy and then the backup to
[17:08] that one guy in case God forbid
[17:09] something should happen to the one guy
[17:11] right it's really significantly more
[17:13] than that it's just that you always have
[17:15] that Cult of Personality following
[17:17] around the one presidential candidate
[17:20] and to a certain extent then the backup
[17:21] guy the vice president rather than you
[17:24] really are electing an Administration um
[17:28] you're not even necessarily I would say
[17:29] electing a party anymore I mean the US
[17:32] does have it's a two-party system I hate
[17:35] it but it is what it is we it's the
[17:37] reality we just have to suffer for the
[17:39] current period um hopefully that changes
[17:41] in the near future but I don't see a
[17:43] realistic way it does um over the course
[17:46] of our lifetime now with that said when
[17:49] you do get an Administration you are
[17:51] going to get the likes of the V you are
[17:52] going to get the likes of uh RFK you are
[17:55] going to get the likes of tuckle Carlson
[17:57] like I don't even like Tucker but holy
[18:00] God how incredible would it be to see
[18:02] him as the press secretary and just
[18:04] absolutely troll the mainstream media uh
[18:07] for the next four years right it it
[18:09] would just be hilarious right like
[18:10] top-notch Entertainment Television um
[18:14] but you really are getting that whole
[18:15] Administration and it's I guess it's
[18:17] still yet to be determined at least
[18:18] publicly what roles each of these
[18:21] individuals will have um in the
[18:23] administration but if RFK really does
[18:26] become something um overseeing the EPA
[18:29] um overseeing the
[18:31] um all the various health organizations
[18:35] the FDA for instance EPA I'm not sure I
[18:38] would be a big fan of and even Trump
[18:40] said on Rogan he doesn't want RFK
[18:43] involved in any anything environmental
[18:45] even though I'm pretty sure RFK would
[18:46] love that but on the FDA side the Food
[18:49] and Drug Administration I think RFK
[18:51] would be phenomenal to completely uh
[18:54] re-root our entire Health Care system
[18:57] which absolutely has to happen um in the
[18:59] United States and maybe VC becomes
[19:02] something of a treasury secretary SEC
[19:05] related um I don't know it'll be
[19:07] interesting to see how that all shakes
[19:08] out and I think you're right having
[19:11] those people behind you certainly
[19:13] enhances uh the Trump ticket absolutely
[19:15] yeah and and I think uh I forgot before
[19:17] like JD van and Eric Trump they are also
[19:19] kind of low-key bit coiners they often
[19:21] forgot they they they're kind of they
[19:25] also get it I think way more but don't
[19:27] get as many de us uh yeah and to that
[19:31] extent it was disappointing to see uh
[19:34] the administration or rather I don't
[19:36] even know who or what
[19:40] introduced the Trump team to what was it
[19:44] World Liberty Finance or whatever the
[19:46] hell the shitcoin was
[19:48] yes I I don't know who introduced them
[19:51] to that I don't even know what the
[19:52] World Liberty coin does I mean they
[19:56] never even said anything about what this
[19:57] uh utility took token supposedly is
[19:59] right I mean do you know anything no
[20:01] actually not I did not even do the mercy
[20:04] do research it because I was like yeah
[20:05] okay like on the first step of
[20:08] understanding Bitcoin like everyone in
[20:10] the first step of understanding Bitcoin
[20:12] wants to create their own shitcoins like
[20:14] that that that's just how it goes I I I
[20:16] think that's the evolution people do go
[20:17] through they see okay Bitcoin um when
[20:20] you're when you're still kind of
[20:22] learning what Bitcoin is and I think
[20:24] you're right like Trump understands 2%
[20:26] of Bitcoin right uh which is really he
[20:28] just knows it orange like he is I
[20:30] suppose um so then you always just go
[20:32] and you try to issue your own shitcoin
[20:35] right um but then I think once you're in
[20:38] that industry and once you really start
[20:40] to do your own research and once you
[20:41] really start to engage with the Bitcoin
[20:44] and the crypto Community you see that it
[20:46] really is just Bitcoin that matters um
[20:50] and not to say that there isn't value in
[20:51] ethereum I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist by
[20:54] any stretch of the imagination I as a
[20:56] Libertarian if people see value
[20:57] somewhere Kos to them um to each their
[21:00] own just for me it's Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[21:03] alone and everything else doesn't matter
[21:04] absolutely I mean that's I think that's
[21:07] a good stance I I I don't like the toxic
[21:10] trade of like oh we should fight against
[21:13] all the other the free market will take
[21:15] care of it like if if there's no value
[21:17] and I think there is no value the free
[21:20] market will take care of it like there's
[21:21] no reason for me do do on it even
[21:23] though I was one year ago the one that
[21:26] was really Maxi and really toxic but I
[21:28] actually grew up with the podcast I
[21:30] think I think my my Bitcoin Maxi guests
[21:33] made me less Bitcoin
[21:35] Maxi so I mean so I would agree with you
[21:38] um the toxicity is horrifying it's
[21:42] deafening and it doesn't benefit anybody
[21:46] right uh I mean like you have you have
[21:48] the max Kaisers of the world that and I
[21:50] don't think that he's actually like this
[21:52] I've met the guy once um really really
[21:54] nice guy very different personality
[21:56] behind closed doors than he is publicly
[21:59] so when he's out there absolutely
[22:01] lambasting um the general public the
[22:05] general crypto public uh I don't think
[22:08] he necessarily means it I think he's
[22:09] doing that for clicks and for views
[22:11] right um which it's attention grabbing I
[22:14] mean he's a wild personality in public
[22:17] on when he does his podcast and
[22:18] everything so I get it
[22:21] um I would just like to see
[22:23] substantially less of that from both
[22:26] sides of the aisle I think it's
[22:27] perfectly re I mean I mean at the end of
[22:29] the day this is largely a cypherpunk
[22:31] Libertarian movement I don't understand
[22:34] why we can't Live and Let Live I mean
[22:36] we're all kind of been it together
[22:38] regardless except for the scammers and
[22:40] the real coiners because they can
[22:42] go themselves to death um but like
[22:45] people that are actually building
[22:46] something legitimate or at least are
[22:48] attempting to I don't understand why
[22:50] we're attacking them absolutely
[22:52] absolutely yeah I mean uh I I I got to
[22:54] know a different Max Kai on my podcast
[22:56] actually he was on there a few months
[22:58] ago like not even months ago probably
[23:00] like five weeks ago or something like
[23:01] that and and I was surprised because I
[23:03] only saw those those those other things
[23:07] from him and I was like oh like that
[23:08] will be an interesting one but he was so
[23:10] calm he was so rela like he was so
[23:12] leaned back and I was like oh that that
[23:13] was an interesting one hour and I got so
[23:15] many comments like oh like he was
[23:17] so relaxed and never saw Max like that
[23:19] uh so may maybe it's also just like him
[23:22] getting old and wise but I don't know
[23:24] what's going
[23:25] on partly that I also think it's partly
[23:28] the I mean we all prepare the mask for
[23:31] the people we're supposed to be meeting
[23:33] right I think it was Shakespeare that
[23:35] once said something along those lines
[23:36] right uh so for different audiences you
[23:39] have to prepare a different mask you
[23:40] have to be a different media personality
[23:42] right absolutely absolutely yeah but
[23:45] yeah it's it's probably not essential to
[23:47] to scream one and a half hours at my
[23:49] podcast that usually is really relaxed
[23:51] and
[23:52] chilled
[23:53] yeah um I have a question an interesting
[23:55] one for you you came become CEO uh on
[23:59] the height of of the market in 2021 how
[24:02] was that like you came really like at
[24:03] the what you said February 2021 that's
[24:05] kind of like uh the the the bull like I
[24:08] don't know if it was a top but it was
[24:10] like at least in the year of the top it
[24:12] was so you lived kind of I how how was
[24:15] that I I mean
[24:17] obviously I mean that wasn't my first
[24:20] Bitcoin cycle right that wasn't my first
[24:22] hype cycle uh I had been prior to that
[24:24] through two so I guess like right now we
[24:26] can say I'm in the midst of my fourth
[24:28] cycle right so I know how this Market
[24:30] Works um one of the reasons that uh the
[24:34] shareholders of Samara which back then
[24:36] was cryology asset group one of the
[24:38] reasons that I think that they asked me
[24:40] to step in um was a I had a lot of
[24:43] experience through Deutsche digital um
[24:45] being a crypto portfolio manager being a
[24:48] licensed regulated crypto asset manager
[24:52] and at that time uh we were managing a
[24:54] little bit of cryptology money so it
[24:56] really kind of just made sense for me to
[24:58] step in because I was actually CEO of
[25:00] the company uh both companies for two
[25:02] years um before I stepped down from uh
[25:05] Deutsche digital I think it was at the
[25:06] end of was at the end of last year the
[25:08] end of 2022 I forget exactly uh Life's a
[25:11] whirlwind um but I knew what was coming
[25:17] so we prepared for that on one hand it
[25:20] was absolutely wonderful that the
[25:22] balance sheet after we had listed had
[25:24] ballooned from something like 30 to 35
[25:28] million up to nearly half a billion
[25:31] fantastic that that happened but
[25:32] nonetheless I knew that the recession in
[25:36] Bitcoin was going to be setting in and
[25:39] lo and behold it did uh Bitcoin went
[25:41] from 60-ish down I think the lowest we
[25:44] saw was something around 16 177,000 um
[25:47] during that low cycle I forget exactly
[25:50] and one of our portfolio companies
[25:51] Northern data I mean it really rode uh
[25:54] the Bitcoin hype because I mean it was a
[25:56] Bitcoin minor at the time Northern went
[25:59] from something like 20 euros a share up
[26:01] to 140 and then I think at its ultimate
[26:03] trout it went down to six euros a share
[26:06] uh so that had a huge impact on our
[26:09] balance sheet obviously and we use some
[26:12] of our liquid assets for leverage I
[26:13] think any um any holding company
[26:16] obviously tries to do that but because I
[26:19] knew that that was coming and I'm very
[26:21] anti-cyclical in my investment approach
[26:24] I believe that when there's blood in the
[26:25] streets that's when you need to be
[26:26] investing that's when you need to be
[26:28] buying that's when you need to be
[26:29] building but when your grandma asks you
[26:33] oh how's Bitcoin doing at Christmas
[26:35] that's when you know you need to get the
[26:37] out never out of Bitcoin but you know
[26:40] that the the bare Market is about to
[26:43] happen so we were very well prepared um
[26:46] obviously there's nothing we can really
[26:48] do about the balance sheet uh we rode
[26:50] Bitcoin all the way down to the bottom
[26:52] we rode Northern data to the bottom we
[26:53] rode all the other assets down I'm not a
[26:55] Trader by any stretch of the imagination
[26:58] I'm a buy and hoddle guy so we bought
[27:00] and we huddled and then gradually the
[27:03] markets always started to rebound um
[27:06] we've rode that out for a couple of
[27:08] years we invested in a lot of funds we
[27:10] invested in some companies and every
[27:13] single one of them uh ended up
[27:14] performing
[27:15] well we did have like two Legacy
[27:18] companies that were invested in in 2018
[27:21] 2019 that went belly up over that period
[27:23] of time um it happens uh they weren't my
[27:27] investments they were from Legacy
[27:29] portfolio as I had said
[27:31] before it's just one of the downsides of
[27:33] being in the Venture space but now that
[27:34] we're about to hit a massive liquidity
[27:38] injection I believe um in the macro
[27:41] economy over the coming months plus uh
[27:44] we're going to see the outcome of the US
[27:46] election over the course of the next
[27:48] week week and a half I'm very optimistic
[27:51] on the macro environment moving forward
[27:53] into q1 and Q2 next year I think we
[27:55] haven't even begun to scratch the bull
[27:57] market
[27:58] um not just from a Bitcoin perspective
[28:00] but macro as well I partnered up with
[28:03] coin vigilante this is the most
[28:06] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[28:09] saw created by anyone look at that
[28:12] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[28:14] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[28:18] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[28:21] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[28:23] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[28:27] coin Vil just dropped a completely new
[28:30] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[28:33] watch collections you have the date of
[28:36] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[28:39] there and of course also the block
[28:41] height and which EPO we are currently in
[28:45] I love the level of detail they put in
[28:47] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[28:50] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[28:53] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[28:55] love those watches so so much if you
[28:59] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:01] regular basis I'll guess you already
[29:03] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[29:05] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[29:09] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[29:11] personal recommendation for Hardware
[29:13] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[29:16] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[29:18] gift for a friend who has still the
[29:20] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[29:23] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[29:26] checkout visit bitbox do ss/ robobin to
[29:31] get your bitbox and the next step is to
[29:34] really level up your sovereignty as an
[29:36] individual you have to have the most
[29:38] secure self- custody setup you have to
[29:41] secure your own devices you have to
[29:44] protect your privacy you have to set up
[29:47] an inheritance plan and depending on
[29:49] where you live you even want to have a
[29:51] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[29:54] in case something goes really really
[29:56] wrong and through all those steps the
[29:58] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[30:01] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin

[30:08] minute free call to find out how you can
[30:11] level up your sovereignty as as I think
[30:14] the the period right now is really
[30:16] interesting uh because it's like there's
[30:17] no blood in the streets like the theit
[30:19] Bitcoin Market is up since since a long
[30:21] time and it's up a good amount but it
[30:25] feels still like the the bull market is
[30:28] just getting started like the the the
[30:30] crazy calls like the grandma calls as
[30:32] you described it it's not there yet I
[30:34] get some more calls right now actually
[30:36] like it's it's it's crazy how bullish
[30:39] actually my family and my surrounding is
[30:41] I don't know if that's just because I've
[30:43] been so wal about Bitcoin or it's
[30:45] actually like happening now um where do
[30:47] you think are we right now in the in the
[30:49] in the Bitcoin cycle uh and and what do
[30:52] you expect over like the next two three
[30:54] four years um I mean I expect a lot of
[30:58] the same right um I think I mean so
[31:02] every year it takes a couple of months
[31:04] of consolidation post behaving uh before
[31:07] we really start to see that bitcoin
[31:08] price truly rip and reach new all-time
[31:11] highs and granted we did set a new
[31:14] all-time high earlier this year getting
[31:16] up to around 73
[31:18] 74,000 I do think it's going to be going
[31:20] substantially higher than that over the
[31:22] course of the coming months and I think
[31:24] that we're still in this lull period
[31:26] largely because everyone is waiting to
[31:28] see the outcome of the US election um
[31:31] because even like you said I mean you're
[31:33] a bitcoiner you're an Austrian you've
[31:36] been following the US election more so
[31:39] than Austrian politics just because of
[31:42] what that has on a macro Global impact
[31:46] right um I mean we're either going to
[31:48] get Donald Trump who did have a very
[31:50] good economy or we're going to get
[31:53] communism that is very anti- Bitcoin in
[31:56] kamla Harris so there's massive impacts
[31:59] that could come out of this election
[32:01] cycle uh both for Bitcoin and for the
[32:04] global macroeconomy as a whole and it's
[32:06] going to be interesting to see how all
[32:07] of this shakes out over the next week or
[32:09] two um and get your popcorn ready it's
[32:12] going to be absolute fireworks I think
[32:14] I'm I'm already
[32:18] stocked uh two small things are
[32:21] different uh this cycle the the one
[32:23] thing is we reached an a nominal
[32:26] all-time high before the Haring I that
[32:28] never happened before and we have the
[32:30] Bitcoin ETF in In America which is also
[32:32] kind of a big deal do you think that or
[32:35] like what do you think is the impact of
[32:37] of those two things uh on the cycle
[32:40] overall and there's always like I know
[32:42] every cycle there's this talk of a super
[32:44] cycle uh I don't like to bring it up
[32:46] again but uh I think like at some point
[32:49] those Cycles might actually break how do
[32:51] you think about the impact of the
[32:52] Bitcoin ETF and the Cycles overall in
[32:55] the
[32:56] future I mean I mean clearly we reached
[33:00] that new all-time high before the having
[33:03] uh because of the hype around the
[33:04] Bitcoin ETF right um the we had like
[33:08] what 10 ETFs that were approved all on
[33:10] the same day and they end up going on to
[33:13] become Far and Away the most successful
[33:16] ETF launches in history um which I don't
[33:20] even necessarily think Black Rock
[33:22] expected that I don't think um Fidelity
[33:25] or anybody else necessarily expected
[33:27] that I think that they knew it was going
[33:28] to be successful we knew the demand was
[33:30] there but were they going to be as
[33:32] successful as quickly as they did no
[33:34] absolutely no nobody I think reasonably
[33:36] expected that so it's great to see that
[33:39] it finally got done um I am so I
[33:44] personally have always felt that the
[33:46] Bitcoin ETF while yes
[33:49] Monumental uh just because some people
[33:52] prefer a user journey of holding an ETF
[33:55] some institutions from a regulatory or
[33:57] compliance perspective have to hold an
[33:59] ETF relative to Native Bitcoin um just
[34:02] the way of the world I suppose uh but I
[34:05] don't even think that that was
[34:06] necessarily the biggest news uh for
[34:08] Bitcoin over the last year or so for me
[34:11] and this is my CPA nerd background I
[34:14] mean he used to be an auditor with PWC
[34:16] right for me the fb's ruling that
[34:20] Bitcoin on balance sheets can be fair
[34:22] valued and should be fair valued uh that
[34:25] was bigger news I think than the Bitcoin
[34:29] ETF was and I've been saying this for
[34:31] some time and the reasoning for that is
[34:33] it used to be that you could only uh
[34:35] from a financial reporting perspective
[34:38] for public companies you would really
[34:40] only have Bitcoin recorded as of its
[34:43] cost on your balance sheet and then if
[34:46] you sold it at some point in time you
[34:48] could have a realized gain a markup
[34:49] based on the proceeds of the sale or if
[34:53] you had uh if you had to incur an
[34:55] impairment test you would write down the
[34:56] value of the Bitcoin from an unrealized
[34:59] perspective switching that method of
[35:01] accounting in the last year or two um
[35:04] over to complete fair value reporting
[35:07] that's Monumental uh because it means
[35:09] that they can actually accurately
[35:11] reflect the value of Bitcoin on your
[35:12] books micro strategy can do it Samar
[35:15] asset group we IFRS reporting as a
[35:17] European company but iasb will very
[35:20] likely follow the fb's lead on this um
[35:23] that means that you can properly assess
[35:26] the value of Bitcoin CO as a liquid
[35:29] asset on your balance sheet and what
[35:31] will be interesting to see is if over
[35:33] the coming years it can be considered a
[35:36] part of cash and cash equivalence um
[35:39] from a uh from a line item perspective
[35:43] because that will be huge because then
[35:45] people won't just have Bitcoin running
[35:47] through oci as far as income goes but
[35:50] rather you'll actually be able to
[35:52] disclose Bitcoin as a um liquid asset on
[35:56] your balance sheet off setting uh it
[35:59] it'll be a current asset offsetting
[36:00] current liabilities that'll be the next
[36:02] big thing that I would like to see
[36:03] happen the the fastb rules I think
[36:05] they're coming in December if I'm not
[36:07] mistaken ex they take effect this
[36:09] December but the fb's already ruled it
[36:11] um so basically as of 1231 2024 the
[36:15] accounting standard uh officially shifts
[36:17] over which is going to be huge for
[36:19] companies next year I mean we're talking
[36:21] about I think I I saw it on X recently
[36:25] um the balances of cash that a lot of
[36:28] companies are holding like Burkshire is
[36:29] holding nearly 200 billion Apple has
[36:31] been holding on to 100 billion for God
[36:34] knows how long Microsoft which recently
[36:37] just announced or not announced but
[36:39] rather they put in their shareholders
[36:41] proxy voting this upcoming uh voting
[36:44] session for Microsoft should they use
[36:47] their cash proceeds to buy and hold
[36:49] Bitcoin and we'll see how their
[36:51] shareholders vote if their shareholders
[36:53] are smart and they've been watching
[36:54] what's been happening with micro
[36:56] strategy they'll obviously ratify that
[36:58] that um and you got to remember who the
[37:00] second biggest shareholder of Microsoft
[37:03] is it's Black Rock um he's the they're
[37:06] the second biggest holders of micro
[37:08] strategy uh behind Bill Gates guess what
[37:10] instrument they're probably going to use
[37:12] at Microsoft to buy and hold Bitcoin um
[37:15] it's probably going to be that magical
[37:16] Black Rock ETF so that's going to have
[37:20] massive impact because now companies
[37:24] starting January 1st 2025 will be able
[37:27] to Fair value Bitcoin and that trillions
[37:30] upon trillions of dollars that is
[37:32] sitting in cash around the world can be
[37:35] deployed to bitcoin as a treasury
[37:37] Reserve asset um so I'm actually real
[37:39] excited to see what will happen there
[37:42] because that could be again a bigger
[37:45] impact than what the Bitcoin ETFs had
[37:48] earlier this year on bitcoin's price how
[37:50] How likely if you have to put a
[37:52] percentage on that with uh giving man
[37:54] with the black rock one and the the that
[37:57] Bitcoin has make around the Microsoft
[38:00] thing How likely is it that Microsoft
[38:02] actually goes ahead and buys Bitcoin in
[38:04] the next year I I i'
[38:07] so I would
[38:09] maybe I don't know um the conspiracy
[38:13] theorist in me would probably say it's
[38:16] already 100% guarantee um and I base
[38:20] that almost exclusively on Black Rock uh
[38:23] owning something like 9 to 10% I forget
[38:26] the exact number but I think it's
[38:27] roughly 9 to 10% of Microsoft which
[38:30] means that at the actual shareholder
[38:31] meeting the proxy vote they're probably
[38:33] going to end up being a substantial
[38:35] amount um of the voting which means that
[38:39] okay I think it's um The Bill and
[38:42] Melinda Gates Foundation or I think it's
[38:44] just bill because they got divorced um
[38:46] so the foundation or wherever Bill Gates
[38:49] has his shares that's number one the
[38:51] only person that I think can block this
[38:52] will be uh Bill Gates and I don't know
[38:56] if he's ever said anything positively or
[38:58] negatively about Bitcoin correct me if
[39:00] I'm wrong there but I don't off the top
[39:02] of my head right now I can't remember
[39:03] him ever saying anything about Bitcoin
[39:06] he he made some comments but I don't
[39:09] know exactly what it was not positive
[39:11] not negative it was some some weird
[39:12] comments like techology or something
[39:15] like that I don't know um but I think
[39:18] he's the only one that would probably be
[39:19] able to kill it because I do believe
[39:22] that the reason this is included on the
[39:24] proxy is because of Black Rock and the
[39:26] ETF
[39:28] um so I the conspiracy theorist in me
[39:32] already is saying it's a done deal uh
[39:34] they will be buying Bitcoin over the
[39:36] next
[39:37] year the rational me is looking at this
[39:40] and saying 20 to 25% likelihood um just
[39:46] because corporate
[39:48] boardrooms proxies all this kind of
[39:50] stuff it's a complex bureaucratic overly
[39:54] regulated
[39:55] world I don't know
[39:57] um I'm not a Microsoft shareholder or I
[40:01] don't know maybe I am through my old
[40:02] 401K somewhere I guess I'm I'm not even
[40:05] entirely sure um but I would be
[40:07] surprised if they start at any time in
[40:09] the relative near future I mean it's
[40:11] it's also it's I think it's uh the the
[40:14] signal of that is amazing like only the
[40:17] that Microsoft now has to take an
[40:19] official stance probably also Bill Gates
[40:22] has to kind of take an official or
[40:24] inofficial stance on Bitcoin now and
[40:26] this loone this state in in in in the in
[40:29] the history and then now compared to
[40:32] like one year in the future two years in
[40:34] the future and then the Microsoft uh
[40:36] shareholders can say like oh we did not
[40:38] buy it one year ago now we missed up out
[40:41] on that one uh let's let's do it again
[40:44] this vot like like let's let's see if if
[40:46] we now want to to buy it now so I think
[40:48] that's that alone is a big thing so this
[40:50] is
[40:51] why I mean we we're a public company and
[40:54] we hold Bitcoin on our balance sheet it
[40:56] is our only treasury Reserve asset we
[40:59] don't even hold like we literally hold
[41:01] at Samara asset group um enough Euro for
[41:05] maybe a month or two of just general
[41:07] operational expenses I mean we have
[41:09] lawyers we have to pay we have we have
[41:11] administrators we have to pay we have
[41:13] Regulators we have to pay etc etc right
[41:16] um but everything else is in Bitcoin and
[41:19] it has to be in Bitcoin because the
[41:20] Bitcoin will always continue to
[41:22] appreciate relative to Fiat um I mean
[41:26] I'm not gonna sit here and on Fiat
[41:29] or propo it but everything I do believe
[41:32] over time does go to zero relative to
[41:35] bitcoin um Bitcoin is just absolute
[41:38] perfection in its monetary policy that
[41:40] that's the inevitability of Bitcoin
[41:42] relative to all other assets um now if
[41:47] I'm a small public company and I look at
[41:52] a what has happened with micro strategy
[41:54] which that is a very unique circumstance
[41:56] I mean Michael sailor was really early
[41:59] when he started to do this um I mean we
[42:01] actually owned Bitcoin before Michael
[42:02] sailor uh but either way uh obviously
[42:06] he's been significantly more vocal and
[42:08] better about this over the last couple
[42:09] of years than we've been able to be
[42:11] being a European company um I don't
[42:14] think for most public companies the
[42:18] Michael sailor strategy makes a lot of
[42:20] sense um he's taking a massive amount of
[42:24] risk on his books with all of the
[42:26] perpetual BS that he's issuing and it's
[42:29] continuing to dilute himself and he's
[42:33] basically now derived 90 to 90% 5% of
[42:37] the value of his company in Bitcoin
[42:40] that's not for
[42:41] everybody um I think regardless though
[42:46] everybody should be holding Bitcoin on
[42:47] their balance sheets and anything that
[42:49] doesn't need to be used for operations
[42:51] should be in Bitcoin but what I advocate
[42:54] for Microsoft for instance to go out and
[42:56] issue a 100 billion bond which it
[42:58] probably could if it wanted to um but to
[43:01] issue a 100 billion bond to buy 90
[43:03] billion in Bitcoin and have a 10 billion
[43:05] cash Reserve no that that probably
[43:07] wouldn't be smart for Microsoft to do
[43:10] but if I'm a small public company and I
[43:12] see that Microsoft is clearly planning
[43:16] something around Bitcoin I look at this
[43:19] and I go yeah you know what that's
[43:21] probably an inevitability maybe it
[43:23] doesn't happen this year but it is an
[43:24] inevitability that Microsoft will be bu
[43:27] buying Bitcoin and they're huge so maybe
[43:30] they could do something like a sailor
[43:32] Playbook maybe I should be rethinking my
[43:35] corporate treasury strategy and if I can
[43:38] front run Microsoft and I can acquire a
[43:40] few hundred maybe a couple thousand
[43:42] Bitcoin um based on whatever size my
[43:45] company is and how many liquid Reserve
[43:47] assets I have and I can put most of it
[43:49] into Bitcoin without bankrupting the
[43:51] company that might not be a bad idea so
[43:54] I think you're going to start to see
[43:55] more low and midcap companies that are
[43:57] publicly traded uh they're probably
[44:01] going to end up following suit and try
[44:03] to front run
[44:04] Microsoft I mean there's a couple public
[44:06] companies in the US that now hold
[44:07] Bitcoin micro strategy of course being
[44:09] the flagship and then Tesla uh but even
[44:12] Tesla sold a good chunk of it although
[44:13] it hasn't lately um Tesla and micro
[44:17] strategy are kind of in a microcosm of
[44:20] let's call them crazy CEOs um people
[44:23] that are well known uh publicly they're
[44:25] fire Brands right I mean musk and
[44:27] Michael sailor so most companies are not
[44:31] going to want to draw that level of
[44:32] attention to themselves but I do think
[44:34] that we're going to see some of the
[44:35] smaller caps decide that it is a smart
[44:38] idea to try to front run the large caps
[44:41] that are clearly having internal
[44:44] conversations about this and inevitably
[44:46] will be going into Bitcoin um I mean
[44:48] wasn't it just recently the Google CTO
[44:51] came out in huge support of Bitcoin was
[44:53] that the Google CTO or the Microsoft one
[44:55] I forget the Microsoft C
[44:57] Microsoft C say yeah okay I'm mixing
[45:00] them up then okay so I mean there's just
[45:03] another endorsement from uh one of the
[45:05] head guys at Microsoft about how great
[45:06] Bitcoin is um like I said the conspiracy
[45:09] theorist in me thinks that it's already
[45:11] an inevitability um that they'll be
[45:13] putting Bitcoin on the balance sheet but
[45:15] I think it's 20 to 25% over the course
[45:17] of the coming year absolutely the
[45:18] Microsoft CTO uh I just saw a simply
[45:22] Bitcoin uh uh tweet of that said I don't
[45:25] know why I had thought of it before but
[45:28] Bitcoin is an incredible powerful
[45:30] concept and I don't think we have fully
[45:32] crafted what it could mean for society
[45:34] so I mean that's a pretty bullish
[45:37] statement it's a very bullish statement
[45:39] and the truth is is that he's right I
[45:41] mean you even alluded to this a little
[45:43] bit earlier um I mean Donald Trump maybe
[45:46] understands 2% of what Bitcoin is uh
[45:48] even the best of the best Michael sailor
[45:52] you said at best he probably 80%
[45:55] understands what Bitcoin is I don't know
[45:57] maybe that means I'm in the 70 to 75%
[45:59] range I don't know um I would like to
[46:01] hope that I understand Bitcoin nearly as
[46:03] well as sailor um but I truly do not yet
[46:08] think a I don't think we've seen let's
[46:11] call it the final evolution the final
[46:14] stage of what Bitcoin can and should be
[46:16] uh we're so far off from what that is
[46:18] and I don't mean from a uh price
[46:21] perspective what it's prices relative to
[46:23] the dollar I mean we talked about that a
[46:25] little bit here because I mean yeah
[46:26] we're on your podcast of course we have
[46:28] to talk about it if you ask me about it
[46:30] for me one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin I
[46:32] really don't care where the price is I
[46:33] buy every hour on the hour Bitcoin um I
[46:37] don't care where the price is um I I use
[46:40] River personally doing that Alexander
[46:42] Lehman's company in the United States
[46:44] it's an automated Buy dcing in every
[46:46] hour on the hour and I don't care where
[46:48] the price is I like it when it goes down
[46:50] personally because then I get to buy
[46:51] more but obviously I like it when it's
[46:53] up being the CEO of Samar asset group so
[46:55] it's a internal struggle I have right
[46:59] but we haven't yet seen I think what
[47:02] will be the final evolution of Bitcoin
[47:06] which I don't even think because the
[47:08] technology wasn't available back then uh
[47:10] Satoshi Nakamoto whoever they were
[47:13] necessarily fathomed I mean when you
[47:15] think about Bitcoin of course its
[47:17] initial white paper um is being this
[47:20] peer-to-peer e- money right um being
[47:23] being the censorship resistant uh
[47:25] intermediary list payment system digital
[47:28] payment system that's how Satoshi
[47:30] envisioned this that's how the initial
[47:33] uh white paper was written that's how
[47:35] everything was enacted fast forward a
[47:38] couple of years and only the real ogs
[47:42] necessarily appreciated Bitcoin in that
[47:44] initial stage of what it is and what it
[47:46] was but everybody started to realize
[47:49] okay actually yeah it's great that it
[47:51] can be a peer-to-peer res censorship
[47:53] resistant ecash but it actually looks
[47:55] and operates more like a dig digital
[47:57] commodity more like digital
[47:59] gold I think the next Evolution and like
[48:03] I mean that the digital gold thing was a
[48:05] bit of a clever uh Rebrand of Bitcoin
[48:08] for masses and for institutions that
[48:11] didn't yet understand why we needed a
[48:14] new digital payment system or
[48:17] necessarily had the same Cipher Punk
[48:19] libertarian values that maybe people
[48:21] like you and I do have from the Austrian
[48:23] economics school that we see the value
[48:26] of government less money right um
[48:29] institutions don't get that they love
[48:31] government money because they get it for
[48:32] free all the time from the Federal
[48:34] Reserve right um if where do you think
[48:36] that money gets uh printed
[48:38] to
[48:40] so that's where that evolution of
[48:43] Bitcoin uh helped us reach the adoption
[48:46] levels that we have right now and that's
[48:48] why the ETF is being successful so great
[48:50] a new narrative a new use case digital
[48:53] gold fine I'm all for it but I don't
[48:57] think that that's the final evolution of
[48:58] Bitcoin and I personally even think that
[49:01] using The Narrative of digital gold and
[49:04] even The Narrative of censorship
[49:06] resistant uh peer-to-peer
[49:08] ecash I think those sell Bitcoin a
[49:11] little bit short of what it can and
[49:13] inevitably will be and this is going to
[49:16] be my accounting bias because I think of
[49:18] Bitcoin instead of as just a cash or
[49:21] hard money or as digital gold I think of
[49:25] Bitcoin more as a ledger system
[49:27] and I think with the Advent of layer
[49:31] twos and that hopefully we'll be able to
[49:34] still Leverage The decentralization and
[49:37] security of Bitcoin I mean Bitcoin is
[49:39] perfected that Bitcoin is the perfectly
[49:40] secure money it is the most
[49:42] decentralized money but it hasn't yet
[49:45] been scalable nor has it had utility
[49:48] built into it right so that is where
[49:51] with the Advent of layer twos I think we
[49:55] will see sorry someone's give me a call
[49:58] I think we will inevitably see utility
[50:01] brought to bitcoin tokenization brought
[50:03] to bitcoin real world asset tokenization
[50:06] brought to bitcoin stable coins brought
[50:09] to bitcoin government issued stable
[50:11] coins secured uh on the Bitcoin
[50:14] Network I think when this happens and
[50:17] even uh Capital markets um by the way so
[50:20] like uh digital gold will be traded on
[50:24] bitcoin uh Parcels of land equities
[50:27] debts derivatives tokenized financial
[50:29] instruments traded on
[50:31] bitcoin I think that's an
[50:33] inevitability and when you see that
[50:35] happen Bitcoin evolves from being
[50:38] digital gold and the world's most
[50:41] perfected form of hard money it becomes
[50:44] the digital Ledger system upon which all
[50:47] of global Finance all of global Commerce
[50:50] transacts and I think we're probably 5
[50:53] to 10 years away from that at least a
[50:56] lot of regulatory questions to be
[50:58] answered a lot of compliance questions
[50:59] to be answered a lot of technology that
[51:02] needs to be built uh in and around
[51:04] Bitcoin or that needs to be encoded into
[51:07] Bitcoin core um like we're having that
[51:09] huge conversation about covenants uh
[51:11] right now with Bitcoin and we'll see
[51:13] what happens there right um but I
[51:15] definitely think that that is the
[51:18] inevitability of Bitcoin and that is so
[51:22] much more than anything I think most
[51:25] people today are imagining and it's
[51:28] significantly more than Satoshi even
[51:30] imagined when he wrote the white paper
[51:32] absolutely that that that's so true um I
[51:36] I love that a lot yeah really cool that
[51:39] short rant there um we have in the end
[51:41] routine of our podcast two quick
[51:42] questions the first is always the same
[51:44] question for each guest uh and the
[51:46] question for you is what can we learn
[51:48] from you besides Bitcoin oh nothing I'm
[51:52] not a very smart
[51:53] person
[51:55] um no I mean
[51:57] um I I don't know if you like golf uh
[52:01] you can follow me I I I I love golf I
[52:04] post all the time on my Twitter my ex
[52:06] about golf um I used to be a scratch
[52:09] golfer now I'm still a single
[52:10] handicapper uh I have friends that ask
[52:12] me for tips all the time in it um I mean
[52:15] we actually hosted the first ever uh
[52:17] World Bitcoin Golf Championship at
[52:19] Bitcoin Nashville uh this year um and
[52:22] that was actually a lot of fun that
[52:23] tournament ended up being significantly
[52:25] bigger more fun than I think any of us
[52:28] ever imagined we had a um we had a
[52:30] hole-in-one competition that I sponsored
[52:33] uh at this tournament and basically we
[52:34] said if you got a hole in one Samar is
[52:36] going to give you an entire Bitcoin no
[52:38] questions asked and you know what so
[52:41] actually I ended up being it was a par
[52:44] three so like 145 yard par three I think
[52:46] it was um so I took my pitching wedge
[52:49] and I literally parked it like two and a
[52:50] half three feet um from the hole which
[52:53] would have been so cool if I had been
[52:54] able to win my company's own Bitcoin
[52:57] um but I I ended up not even winning
[52:59] closest to the pin uh one younger kid I
[53:02] think he was in his 20s um he ended up
[53:04] parking it like six inches uh but we had
[53:06] it on video and everything it was so
[53:07] cool but on one of the other par 3s uh
[53:11] one of the guys and he was a scratch
[53:12] golfer he hit a hole in one um so
[53:15] naturally we didn't give him the Bitcoin
[53:17] because hey you didn't hit it on the
[53:19] right Hole uh so we give him a Dogecoin
[53:21] uh just to with him I love it yeah
[53:26] fun with that he was like don't even
[53:28] send it to me and I'm like nope give me
[53:29] your wallet you're getting a Dogecoin
[53:31] for hitting a bit hole in one on the
[53:32] wrong hole that's like a punishment for
[53:34] that exactly thank you so much we have
[53:38] an endro podcast where the previous
[53:39] guest is asking a question for the next
[53:41] guest without knowing who the next guest
[53:42] is um what are the biggest what is the
[53:46] biggest challenge that Bitcoin will face
[53:48] in the future
[53:50] politicians um I think it will the
[53:54] biggest challenge that Bitcoin will
[53:57] always continue to face I do think will
[53:59] be politicians and weaponized
[54:02] three-letter agencies which frankly it
[54:04] isn't even a challenge for Bitcoin um
[54:07] the reason being because you can't beat
[54:09] Bitcoin there is no killing Bitcoin
[54:11] there is no Banning Bitcoin yes you can
[54:13] take and physically lock me up throw
[54:15] away the key but you'll never under any
[54:18] circumstances no government on this
[54:20] God's Earth will ever be able to take my
[54:22] Bitcoin from me or be able to ban my
[54:24] ability to use Bitcoin coin maybe it has
[54:27] to be on black markets because we go
[54:29] down this full globalist tyrannical
[54:31] route I don't know what the world's
[54:33] going to look like 5 10 15 20 years from
[54:35] now I hope we don't get there I hope we
[54:38] I hope we as bitcoiners are able to show
[54:40] to the world what individual sovereignty
[54:43] and individual Financial
[54:45] sovereignty is and why it needs to be
[54:48] fundamentally protected by governments
[54:50] around the world and by us as
[54:52] individuals around the world but you see
[54:55] the attack
[54:56] against Bitcoin you see the ESG movement
[55:00] trying to weaponize itself against
[55:01] Bitcoin which is ridiculous because
[55:03] Bitcoin is far in away the most ESG
[55:05] friendly investment on Earth I mean ESG
[55:08] is not my thing but Bitcoin is the best
[55:10] ESG investment on Earth and it's not
[55:11] even a
[55:12] conversation um and you saw the most
[55:14] recent one uh who was it um I think it
[55:17] was the ECB recently came out and said
[55:20] yeah Bitcoin is bad because it's unfair
[55:24] that people that held Bitcoin early are
[55:27] making a lot of money and other people
[55:29] will not make money on bitcoin which is
[55:31] just the absolute most asinine communist
[55:34] statement the ECB could have ever made
[55:36] about Bitcoin so you are going to see
[55:39] those types of globalist Communists
[55:42] leftists whatever you want to call them
[55:44] and you're also going to see it on the
[55:45] right don't get me wrong you're going to
[55:46] see people on the right attack it as
[55:48] well too but all the attacks right now
[55:50] are coming from the left side um that's
[55:53] going to be its biggest threat but again
[55:56] don't even necessarily see it as a
[55:57] threat to bitcoin itself because you
[55:59] cannot kill you cannot ban Bitcoin maybe
[56:02] I should rephrase this that is the
[56:04] biggest threat to bitcoiners I think
[56:06] that's that's really really great uh
[56:08] yeah thank you so not the threat Bitcoin
[56:11] is great but your answer was really
[56:13] great thank you so much uh Pat for for
[56:16] being on the show before I let you go
[56:18] where can people find you ask your
[56:19] questions uh and and learn more about
[56:21] you I mean absolutely so I mean you can
[56:23] follow us at Samar asset group I mean
[56:25] we're relatively active on Twitter or I
[56:28] guess you call it X I'm never going to

[56:38] doing with Samara and I share a lot of
[56:41] my well Politically Incorrect insights
[56:44] at times I suppose uh when I'm there um
[56:47] you can also follow our proof of Word
[56:49] podcast I have my own proof of wordss um
[56:51] we invite people from within the
[56:53] industry on to talk about Bitcoin as
[56:55] well as other things that I find
[56:57] interesting um so yeah if you ever want
[57:00] to follow or learn something from me
[57:01] like I said I'm not a smart guy I can't
[57:03] tell you anything you're going to learn
[57:04] besides Bitcoin but always happy to have
[57:07] more people as a part of our community
