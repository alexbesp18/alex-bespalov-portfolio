[00:00] nobody ever really taught me what money
[00:02] was nobody discussed the foundation of
[00:05] the system it was just working within
[00:07] the system I used to be in traditional
[00:09] Finance I was a certified financial
[00:11] planner had my own practice in the US
[00:13] and and some things shifted in my life
[00:15] and I fell down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole
[00:18] highfrequency algorithmic trading that
[00:20] shave fractions of pennies off of stock
[00:22] trades might make some money but it's
[00:24] not adding any value I've seen plenty of
[00:27] posts out there that talk about you know
[00:29] every everything in life is a
[00:30] transaction is what am I going to get
[00:33] out of you if that's your basis for your
[00:35] relationship you probably have some
[00:37] pretty bad relationships or some
[00:39] fundamentally flawed ones money is
[00:41] simply that technology for exchanging
[00:44] and trading and storing value but that
[00:47] value is created by us the value is
[00:49] created by
[00:50] [Music]
[00:54] people you wrote a book money love and
[00:57] Bitcoin I think there's a really
[00:58] interesting um in the section of topics
[01:02] something that we have covered on the
[01:04] podcast but very rarely like I think it
[01:06] came probably up in like five episodes
[01:08] of like 400 so it's not a common topic
[01:12] as like as you said it before recorded
[01:14] like when are we at a million that's
[01:16] like almost every other episode that we
[01:18] covered that um so how did this come to
[01:21] that that you wrote that book what what
[01:24] kind of pro you to writing that book
[01:26] yeah so um that's a great question and
[01:29] you know they there's the there's the
[01:30] whole backstory of how we uh you know
[01:32] how you come to fall down the Bitcoin
[01:34] rabbit hole and I used to be in
[01:36] traditional Finance I was a certified
[01:38] financial planner had my own practice in
[01:40] the US and and some things shifted in my
[01:43] life and and uh I fell down the Bitcoin
[01:45] rabbit hole and uh sort of repudiate
[01:48] repudiated all I thought I used to know
[01:52] um and realized everything was very
[01:54] different um but after a couple of years
[01:56] in the space I really realized that
[02:00] there's something missing at least
[02:01] missing to me in a lot of the voices
[02:03] that I hear and um I'm actually a yoga
[02:06] practitioner um and I was actually on
[02:09] the mat one day when it came to me and I
[02:13] said we need to inter we need to bring
[02:15] love into this space um it sort of came
[02:18] to me as the Bitcoin standard on love
[02:20] but I uh I didn't want to use safe's
[02:23] title um safes work but um I realized
[02:27] that that we need to go deeper and I
[02:29] want to hear more voices talking more
[02:31] deeply about how Bitcoin can um you know
[02:36] can change the world and ultimately my
[02:38] subtitle was you know creating a path to
[02:40] a Freer fair and more peaceful world and
[02:43] you know there's that slogan fix the
[02:46] money fix the world um and I think we do
[02:49] have to fix the money as a foundation
[02:52] for fixing the world um but I don't
[02:55] think necessarily just fixing the money
[02:58] is going to fix the world because any
[03:01] technology no matter how wonderful it is
[03:03] and Bitcoin is just a technology and
[03:06] Technology of money and and a much
[03:07] better one than we've had in the past
[03:10] but any technology without the right
[03:13] values um and a shift in Consciousness
[03:16] can be corrupted and distorted just like
[03:19] you know so many Technologies in the
[03:20] past have so you know I think it's a
[03:24] it's a tremendous opportunity that we
[03:27] have as all of humanity and those in the
[03:30] Bitcoin space as Leaders to help Define
[03:35] and envision uh a new dream with Bitcoin
[03:39] as a base layer of money and it takes a
[03:42] lot more than just economics um I I
[03:46] think one of the issues that we've had
[03:51] is that because of our distorted and
[03:53] corrupted monetary system most of
[03:55] humanity has had to view life through
[03:57] the lens of commercial
[04:00] transactions and because it's so hard
[04:04] simply to make a living in a
[04:06] inflationary design system and you know
[04:08] Jeff Booth is is a wonderful descriptor
[04:11] of that how technology and productivity
[04:14] should be making prices fall but our
[04:17] debt Fiat based system makes prices rise
[04:21] um that you know we have an
[04:24] opportunity um to recast our whole
[04:29] systems and structures of society I
[04:31] don't have answers for all of them but I
[04:33] do have lots of questions and I think
[04:34] questions that we all need to be
[04:36] thinking and talking about not just you
[04:38] know Bitcoin adoption and number go up
[04:41] and how many nodes there are and how
[04:43] many
[04:44] devices that's simply um you know a
[04:47] foundation for how we're going to create
[04:50] some new systems um for a better dream
[04:53] for the planet that's super interesting
[04:55] and it's also interesting that that
[04:58] you're coming from the perspective of
[04:59] fin Cal planners I had some financial
[05:01] planners already on and like each of
[05:03] them already told me um if you're active
[05:06] in the financial planning uh world and
[05:09] Bitcoin world it's kind of hard because
[05:10] the financial planning World sees you as
[05:12] crazy uh but also the Bitcoin world is
[05:15] like oh like you are you're part of the
[05:17] Fiat system like it's kind of you you
[05:21] you get [ __ ] from both sides of
[05:23] absolutely and of course when I was a
[05:25] financial planner i i in and in
[05:27] traditional Finance I thoroughly
[05:29] dismissed it
[05:30] um I wish I had listened to my now wife
[05:32] at uh at the time who said what about
[05:34] this Bitcoin thing um because she had
[05:37] this intuitive sense that you know
[05:38] something was wrong out there but you
[05:41] know I was certainly locked into a
[05:42] system and been trained in it um
[05:45] indoctrinated in it and I think that's
[05:47] one of the things that really opened my
[05:49] eyes is I realized when I shifted away I
[05:52] ultimately sold my practice um I was you
[05:56] know on a different journey in life than
[05:58] that had been um and probing some more
[06:01] you know deeper meaning of life and I
[06:04] realized nobody ever really taught me
[06:06] what money was nobody discussed the
[06:09] foundation of the system it was just
[06:11] working within the system so it's you
[06:15] know you know the rules of baseball or
[06:18] football and you can play by those rules
[06:20] but why was the game constructed this
[06:23] way and why do I have to play it this
[06:25] way and why is everybody caught up in
[06:28] this system just playing you know inside
[06:32] the field when the system is not
[06:36] designed for all of our benefit it's
[06:38] designed much to our
[06:41] detriment so after I fell down the
[06:44] proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole and
[06:46] realized what I didn't know being in the
[06:49] world of traditional financial planning
[06:51] um and had dismissed you know that's
[06:54] when I took what I knew from that world
[06:57] which I think is a very strong
[06:58] Foundation because I I have an
[07:01] understanding I have an understanding in
[07:02] modern portfolio Theory I understanding
[07:05] how the system works um and now when you
[07:08] know how money Works what I realized is
[07:12] why it was so hard um for me to do what
[07:15] I really wanted to do with my clients
[07:17] which is help them live the life they
[07:20] wanted to lead at the end of my career I
[07:23] I rebranded my practice as mindful
[07:25] wealth
[07:26] management because in many years I saw
[07:29] people people it's just about the money
[07:30] it's just about the money and how much
[07:32] extra you know how much did it go up
[07:34] this year it's like that's not what it's
[07:36] about it's about what you want your
[07:39] money to do for your life you know life
[07:43] is not a you know is not a a commercial
[07:46] transaction it's not a function of
[07:48] winning because you hit a number um it
[07:52] it's about adding value it's about using
[07:55] the resources you have to live the life
[07:58] you want
[08:00] but what I didn't realize was why that
[08:03] was so
[08:05] hard why all those people had to come to
[08:08] me to get advice about how should they
[08:12] invest how should they allocate their
[08:14] portfolio you know what percentage of
[08:16] stocks and bonds and other things that
[08:18] they should have which is the inside
[08:20] baseball of traditional finance and
[08:22] financial
[08:23] planning but then when you realize it's
[08:26] simply because you can't
[08:28] save um um that you're forced to invest
[08:32] and take on more risk than most people
[08:35] ever want to take on I mean my clients
[08:37] were not Venture capitalists trying to
[08:39] Parlay some money into fortunes they
[08:43] were regular people you know who worked
[08:45] all their lives saved did the right
[08:48] thing and just didn't want to run out of
[08:50] money before they ran out of
[08:52] life and in a fundamentally flawed
[08:56] system like we
[08:58] have where money's created out of thin
[09:00] air our time in our labor is devalued by
[09:05] inflation um what they would much prefer
[09:07] to do is just store their wealth in the
[09:10] bank and not have to worry about it but
[09:14] we know you can't store your money in
[09:16] the bank and not worry about it so you
[09:18] have to do all these other things and
[09:20] and that's the piece that I think most
[09:22] people in traditional finance and most
[09:24] people throughout the world really don't
[09:26] understand why we're driven to take on
[09:28] more than we want when we can't simply
[09:31] just save our money the way we should be
[09:33] able
[09:34] to will this then also eliminate like
[09:38] 95% of financial advisors if we can save
[09:42] our money and we don't have the need of
[09:44] like playing this game of baseball yeah
[09:47] you know you certainly you can eliminate
[09:49] a lot of things and um this really one
[09:53] of the the where I start in the book you
[09:55] know there's there's a lot of people
[09:57] who've done great work on explaining our
[09:59] monary system and wonderful charts and
[10:01] graphs and why the money is broken um
[10:05] but I take it from a value perspective
[10:07] um you know money is simply that
[10:10] technology for exchanging and trading
[10:13] and storing value but that value is
[10:16] created by us the value is created by
[10:18] people growing food and and building
[10:21] buildings and creating art and music and
[10:24] doing things that other people seem see
[10:27] of
[10:27] value but the people people are adding
[10:30] value and that's authentic money that's
[10:33] money with Integrity unfortunately in
[10:36] the system we have we have a lot of
[10:38] people who are extracting value and we
[10:41] have a lot of systems that that compel
[10:44] you almost to extract value and so for
[10:49] example you know foreign currency
[10:51] transactions and hedging and things like
[10:53] that we have a system that forces one to
[10:57] to do that and businesses to do that if
[10:59] you're selling products in another
[11:01] country you have to hedge those
[11:02] transactions but it adds no value to
[11:06] humanity it's just necessary because of
[11:08] the system and then we have lots of
[11:10] people that are doing things that they
[11:12] can extract money from the system but
[11:15] you know just because you can do
[11:17] something that makes money doesn't mean
[11:19] you're adding value so high frequency
[11:23] algorithmic trading that shave fractions
[11:26] of pennies off of stock trades might
[11:28] make some money but it's not adding any
[11:32] value so you know the opportunity I
[11:35] think we all have to look at it is
[11:37] what's the value we're adding and what
[11:40] activities in our society in our economy
[11:44] and and why is the system set up to
[11:49] focus so much on ACR wealth simply by
[11:53] extracting value and that really robs
[11:56] every individual who extracts value and
[11:59] all of humanity from the gifts and
[12:02] talents of every individual I mean I
[12:04] don't think anybody it's 6 years old
[12:07] said oh I want to be a stock Trader you
[12:10] know I want to be a high frequency Al
[12:12] that's that's just my passion in life no
[12:16] it's a way to make money well you know
[12:18] you you rob everybody including yourself
[12:21] of what really Springs up from inside
[12:24] you um the deeper purpose of your life
[12:27] here the deeper contribution
[12:30] you can make that we can all make um you
[12:32] know we're all different uh we all have
[12:34] our unique gifts and talents um we can
[12:37] all bring different things to the table
[12:39] but we need to be adding value that's an
[12:41] authentic transaction that's an
[12:43] authentic basis for an economic system
[12:48] and so you know governments who can
[12:51] create money out of thin air central
[12:52] banks creating money out of thin air I
[12:55] mean if you just think about that for a
[12:58] second and I know bitcoiners have and
[13:00] they understand it but most people don't
[13:03] because we've just been indoctrinated in
[13:05] the system we don't know any different
[13:08] money is something with a picture of a
[13:10] dead US president or a king or a queen
[13:12] or whatever on it that's just what we
[13:15] think money is um but how can it be
[13:19] money with Integrity if it's not created
[13:21] without any value being added so I think
[13:24] that's where it starts and we start
[13:27] looking at Value adding then you can
[13:30] begin to unravel the whole system and we
[13:32] can begin to think about you know how
[13:35] can we create new systems based on a
[13:38] contribution of
[13:40] value um and pulling away from an
[13:44] extractive system so that we can really
[13:47] all benefit in humanity and we can all
[13:50] express our own gifts and talents that's
[13:52] super interesting Al like exactly this
[13:54] point of like uh when we stop doing
[13:57] those those straight and trying to add
[14:00] more value how does this then affect uh
[14:04] and probably go into that in the book
[14:06] with like love and and money in Bitcoin
[14:09] um but how does this affect relationship
[14:11] how does this affect uh the the
[14:13] connection between two human beings if
[14:15] if all of a sudden you want to add value
[14:17] versus extract value yeah no that's a
[14:19] great point and I I certainly do discuss
[14:22] that um I'm probably one of the few
[14:25] books that uh um talks about money
[14:29] Bitcoin and has several sections not
[14:32] only about love but about relationships
[14:34] and even sex um so you know we get into
[14:38] it um because I I think again that
[14:41] extractive or a commercial mindset you
[14:44] know if we see everything through the
[14:46] lens of a commercial transaction it's
[14:49] that's one thing in the marketplace and
[14:51] you know a free market in commercial
[14:53] transactions is great but a commercial
[14:57] mindset in
[14:59] life that's a whole different ball game
[15:03] and that's a big problem you know I've
[15:05] seen plenty of posts out there that uh
[15:08] talk about you know everything in life
[15:10] is a
[15:12] transaction and you know I'm sure those
[15:15] people operate that way and you can see
[15:18] Life as a
[15:20] transaction um but I don't think that's
[15:23] the basis upon which you raise a child I
[15:26] don't think it's the basis upon which
[15:28] you have a loving relationship with a
[15:31] spouse a friend a lover you know a
[15:33] parent um is what am I going to get out
[15:36] of you um if that's your basis for your
[15:39] relationship you probably have some
[15:41] pretty bad relationships or some
[15:43] fundamentally flawed ones so you know
[15:46] Commerce is an element of life it's a
[15:49] fundamental thing but life is about a
[15:52] lot more than feeding ourself
[15:54] unfortunately in our system it's very
[15:56] hard for many people to Simply do that
[15:59] um but if we can shift some things if
[16:01] prices
[16:03] actually decline rather than rise maybe
[16:07] it won't be so hard for everybody just
[16:09] to make ends meet I mean that's as Jeff
[16:12] boo would say that's the promise of
[16:13] tomorrow that's the price you know the
[16:15] price of Tomorrow is this inflationary
[16:17] system I think it's the promise of
[16:19] tomorrow if we can move into a different
[16:22] environment um but it does affect it
[16:24] affects everything um it affects you
[16:26] know our our food system you know when
[16:29] we have industrial food It's Made For
[16:32] What kind of transaction can we do what
[16:34] can I extract from people not how do I
[16:36] nourish them you know we our health care
[16:38] System when it's about you know how do
[16:41] we create more pills and drugs and how
[16:43] do we do disease management then how do
[16:45] we really nourish
[16:47] well-being um you
[16:49] know and in our relationship certainly
[16:53] um you know if if I I say in the book
[16:56] you know if you pay for sex you know
[16:58] you're not getting
[17:00] love all right so you know it's not a
[17:04] commercial if it's a commercial
[17:06] transaction it's not going to be love
[17:08] based and ultimately I think that's what
[17:11] we all want you know um nothing wrong
[17:16] with having a Lamborghini okay that's
[17:19] fine um but if you had to choose between
[17:22] a Lambo or love to be able to really
[17:26] express it to be able to really feel
[17:29] what what are you going to choose that's
[17:31] easy you know
[17:35] um because ultimately I think you you
[17:37] know the way I look at it is I mean
[17:39] money is simply um you know an
[17:42] expression of our
[17:44] energy and whether you're a Quantum
[17:48] physicist or you follow uh you know a
[17:51] particular uh religious theology or
[17:54] spiritual tradition or wisdom tradition
[17:57] pretty much they all say the same same
[17:59] thing everything is an
[18:02] interconnected Web of Life of energy
[18:06] right and the energy that we have is a
[18:10] reflection and how we use it is a
[18:12] reflection of our
[18:14] Consciousness and the state of our
[18:16] Consciousness drives what we do with our
[18:19] time and
[18:20] energy and if our Consciousness is
[18:23] directed
[18:24] towards giving or taking we're going to
[18:28] act differently
[18:29] you know if it's what I can get out of
[18:31] you you're going to have one type of
[18:33] relationship you're going to have one
[18:35] type of commercial transaction you're
[18:37] going to have one type of
[18:39] society if it's what am I going to give
[18:43] you know how can I
[18:45] express that life source that flows up
[18:48] in me I mean you know a flower that
[18:51] grows out of the ground isn't thinking
[18:53] about what can it get you know out of
[18:58] something it just it does what it does
[19:00] it does its own innate nature and the
[19:02] bee comes and pollinates it and gets
[19:04] something from that and the bee goes
[19:06] back to the hive and creates honey it
[19:09] it's just all part of a system when we
[19:12] when we look at just a small part of the
[19:14] system maintaining commercial
[19:16] transaction and not thinking about how
[19:18] it affects everything else all right we
[19:21] can end up in a rather distorted system
[19:23] and a distorted view of Life at least
[19:26] one that doesn't allow the full
[19:27] potential
[19:29] of the unique characteristics of 8
[19:32] billion people on the planet and I think
[19:35] that's the important part when Bitcoin
[19:36] is talk about fix the money to fix the
[19:38] world it's because you know we genuinely
[19:41] and passionately want to see um you know
[19:46] all 8 billion people on the planet be
[19:49] able to live freely live be able to to
[19:53] be able to express their gifts and
[19:54] talents to be able to transact freely
[19:58] between each other but also to be able
[20:01] to love freely to be able to act in ways
[20:06] that uplift
[20:08] everyone and really contribute to the
[20:10] Human Condition rather than detract from
[20:13] it um you know the uh it's often
[20:18] discussed in the in the in this space is
[20:20] the the Neil how you know the the fourth
[20:23] turning um uh uh principle that we're in
[20:26] a cycle of History where we're on the
[20:29] cusp of a of a dramatic shift and you
[20:32] know those shifts in history have often
[20:34] come um you know like a winter in a
[20:38] harsh condition a freezing in society
[20:41] through war that paves the way for a
[20:44] spring and a rebirth um I'd hope it
[20:47] doesn't have to be that way all right
[20:50] and that's where all of us in this space
[20:52] and all these voices and you know you
[20:55] you're providing an awesome service by
[20:57] giving a voice to so many people that
[21:00] have very different aspects of this from
[21:03] from developers to economists to to
[21:06] people like me that write books with
[21:08] love in the middle of them um to be able
[21:10] to talk about these things and I think
[21:12] that's critically important because it's
[21:14] going to take all of us to be able to
[21:17] create something new um and you know
[21:21] there's room in that for
[21:24] everyone and I think it's one of the
[21:26] things that I saw in this space is
[21:28] there's so much um you know tear the old
[21:31] thing down you know Stick it to the Man
[21:34] kind of thing let's let's you know
[21:36] destroy the old system and that system
[21:38] is going to fall it will need to be
[21:40] replaced all right um but we want to
[21:43] make a transition that allows for
[21:46] everyone to begin to enter um and for
[21:50] everyone to say have a say and a voice
[21:53] and an
[21:54] ability to to
[21:56] participate um and so you know it's not
[21:59] about whether you're a carnivore or a
[22:01] vegan whether you want to live off the
[22:04] grid as a fully sovereign individual or
[22:07] whether you want to live in a commune
[22:09] it's it's expressing whatever you want
[22:12] in life and being able to do that in an
[22:14] economic system that's not robbing us
[22:18] all um of our time and energy um you
[22:23] know we're not going to have an equal
[22:24] system it's not about equality per se
[22:26] and equivalency because we don't come to
[22:29] this life with equal backgrounds with
[22:33] equal talents with equal traits um but
[22:37] at least what we do can be respected if
[22:41] we're really adding value and not have
[22:44] it robbed by A system that devalues our
[22:48] labor by creating this inauthentic fake
[22:51] money that's a great point I love that
[22:55] um and I have to ask um how how does
[22:58] Bitcoin affect
[23:00] sex sure so you know this is the the
[23:03] time preference uh uh activity you know
[23:07] a a money and a system that's fueled on
[23:10] a very shortterm thinking a credit-based
[23:13] system you know I won't wait until I can
[23:16] really afford something I will buy it on
[23:20] credit through debt and then have to
[23:22] work to pay off that debt a very
[23:24] short-term thinking um you know as
[23:27] opposed to a long term thinking you want
[23:29] to invest in something for the long term
[23:31] so you know there's I say it in the book
[23:34] you know um there's an expression no one
[23:37] ever washed a rental car you have a
[23:39] rental car it's very short term you have
[23:41] very little commitment to it you are not
[23:43] going to take care of it you were going
[23:44] to turn it back to the rental car
[23:46] company in whatever condition doing
[23:48] whatever you did to it very short-term
[23:51] thinking well in relationships it's the
[23:54] same thing if you're looking to extract
[23:56] something out of somebody all right um
[24:00] rather than add value if your
[24:02] orientation is Gee you know am I going
[24:05] to be able to sleep with this person
[24:06] tonight can I pick him up at the bar and
[24:08] you know go wherever to have sex that's
[24:11] a pretty short short-term frame of view
[24:14] if on the other hand it's can I build a
[24:17] life with this person can I can we truly
[24:21] work together to make each other happier
[24:23] can we work together to you know uh
[24:26] build a home uh have a farm uh raise
[24:31] children that's a long-term orientation
[24:34] that takes a whole different
[24:37] mindset um you know specifically with
[24:40] sex I mean you know we had this huge
[24:43] proliferation of a porn industry for
[24:45] example okay which again is a short-term
[24:48] commitment all right um it's a whole
[24:51] different thing um so when you begin to
[24:55] think about working with the much deeper
[24:58] energies that we all have access to to
[25:01] take time to tap into to develop to be
[25:04] able to express in a loving relationship
[25:08] it changes the nature of an intimate
[25:10] relationship
[25:12] dramatically from a swipe right swipe
[25:15] left hookup culture and and that's you
[25:18] know a lot of what we have and I think
[25:20] we see you know how unsatisfied most
[25:24] people are with that I mean I think
[25:25] there's a travesty of you know my impr a
[25:28] lot of young people who are caught up in
[25:30] that culture and that cycle who that's
[25:32] what they've known and it's deeply
[25:36] unsatisfying but you know don't
[25:39] necessarily know anymore and you know
[25:42] it's not the only reason but they're all
[25:46] linked so a shortterm Time preference
[25:49] with spend it now get what I want now
[25:53] buy it on credit you know carries over
[25:56] to lots of things
[25:58] Arts architecture everything you know
[26:01] sell tickets not uplift Humanity not
[26:05] create you know a piece of music which
[26:08] is going to move one to tears but it's
[26:11] going to move one to you know click and
[26:14] shell out some bucks for it and do
[26:16] different
[26:19] things that's that's really that's
[26:21] really profound uh and and this time
[26:24] preference thing you can get it into so
[26:26] many aspects of life uh and it was
[26:29] actually my third or fourth guest that
[26:32] came on the show uh who said like
[26:35] Bitcoin is a system based on love and
[26:37] and and I liked it like I never heard it
[26:39] before uh and I think he's one of the
[26:42] few guys that actually said it in that
[26:44] way there were some others that also
[26:45] said it that way probably you also say
[26:47] it in that way that Bitcoin is a system
[26:48] based on love um and it has some it has
[26:51] some real uh truth in it also love the
[26:55] game analogy with with baseball that you
[26:57] you made because then it
[26:59] because people don't think they can opt
[27:01] out of that fat system and that Fiat
[27:04] think they think they are uh they can
[27:07] they are in the feere system and they
[27:09] have to be in that system like it is a
[27:12] good citizen is in that system uh and
[27:15] and you you cannot step out but once you
[27:19] uh once you really understand it's just
[27:21] a game it's just like a rule set that
[27:24] you accept once you accept feed and you
[27:27] can accept Bitcoin instead and and
[27:29] accept that rule set you also change the
[27:31] game for for that matter I for example
[27:35] now accept Bitcoin payments from my
[27:36] sponsor sponsors I get now my my most of
[27:39] my income actually in Bitcoin uh and it
[27:42] it it changes how you think about money
[27:44] it changes how you think about those
[27:47] things even though I was already before
[27:49] all in Bitcoin but coming close and
[27:52] closer to bitcoin standard definitely
[27:55] impacts how you think about spending how
[27:57] you think about uh what what you value
[28:00] and how how you how you value yourself
[28:02] and also it it almost raises your own
[28:05] standard like if when you come back to
[28:08] this hookup example of like oh like I
[28:11] want to have today a hookup that sets
[28:13] your standard really low like because
[28:16] it's just today in a in a bar uh there's
[28:19] probably like 50% of of of people that
[28:22] like oh like I could sleep with them but
[28:25] if the standard is not oh I can I want
[28:28] to to sleep with them today but the
[28:29] standard is like which persons here in
[28:32] this bar would I like to build a life
[28:35] with for the rest of my life you you
[28:38] sort out a lot of people all of the
[28:41] sudden you're like not with that person
[28:43] not with that person so it's about
[28:44] raising your standard and Bitcoin does
[28:47] that and and that's a that's a really
[28:49] interesting Insight of like what Bitcoin
[28:52] does to you because it not only uh
[28:56] lowers your time preference it's just
[28:58] just such an abstract thing to say but
[29:01] the implications are really uh heavy on
[29:05] on the individual and and I like how how
[29:08] you frame it and how you how you go in
[29:10] there thank you yeah you know and I
[29:11] think it's important in all of that that
[29:13] we do it as best we can without judgment
[29:16] it's not about judging whether that's
[29:17] one's right or wrong it's just about
[29:20] reflecting on a little more
[29:22] self-reflection about you know what is
[29:25] going on here that I may be um you know
[29:29] conditioned or programmed the guidance
[29:31] that I get the signals that I get are to
[29:33] act a certain way and and is that really
[29:36] going to make me happy you know when you
[29:39] reflect on it and think a little bit
[29:41] more from you know not just tomorrow or
[29:44] you know tonight to to that longer term
[29:47] you can make your decisions and people
[29:49] are going to make different decisions
[29:50] and that's fine um but you know it gives
[29:55] us the opportunity to think about a
[29:57] little bit more and to talk about it to
[29:59] to be a little more self-reflective
[30:01] rather than just following what
[30:03] everybody else is doing I partnered up
[30:07] with coin vigilante this is the most
[30:10] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[30:12] saw created by anyone look at that
[30:15] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[30:18] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[30:21] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[30:24] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[30:27] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[30:30] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[30:33] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:37] watch collections you have the date of
[30:39] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:42] there and of course also the block
[30:45] height and which EPO we are currently in
[30:48] I love the level of detail they put in
[30:51] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[30:53] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:56] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[30:59] love those watches so so much if you
[31:02] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:04] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:06] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:09] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[31:12] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:15] personal recommendation for Hardware
[31:16] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[31:19] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[31:21] gift for a friend who has still the
[31:24] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[31:27] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[31:30] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[31:34] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[31:37] to really level up your sovereignty as
[31:39] an individual you have to have the most
[31:42] secure self- custody setup you have to
[31:44] secure your own devices you have to
[31:47] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:50] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:53] where you live you even want to have a
[31:55] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:58] in case something goes really really
[32:00] wrong and through all those steps the

[32:14] how you can level up your sovereignty
[32:17] that's a that's a good way of looking at
[32:18] that I really like that um H how do your
[32:22] approach uh in the book is theit the
[32:24] book is probably written for for
[32:26] bitcoiners to to get deeper into Bitcoin
[32:29] and interaction with love and and and uh
[32:33] relationships and and with with money um
[32:36] or is it also an orange peeling tool for
[32:39] for for other people well yeah that's a
[32:42] great it's a great question and I think
[32:43] it's both I mean it started uh in many
[32:46] ways from the idea that that within the
[32:48] Bitcoin space and with those who were
[32:50] starting to do this work we need to
[32:52] think about more than just you know
[32:55] certain elements that are discussed all
[32:56] the time you know
[32:58] all the the day-to-day daily minations
[33:01] of what's going to happen with the
[33:02] number and that kind of stuff we need to
[33:04] think about these deeper topics that
[33:06] we've been talking about and that those
[33:08] of us in the Bitcoin space and the
[33:10] leaders need to be bringing this forward
[33:13] so that Bitcoin isn't just viewed
[33:15] through a the the historic lens that it
[33:18] has been which is you know it's you know
[33:22] it's a questionable investment it's a
[33:25] risky scheme you know it's a p
[33:28] it's it's you know it's it's for
[33:30] criminals all that stuff if we recast it
[33:33] is this is a fundamental change in a
[33:37] shift in a
[33:38] foundation of our institutions and our
[33:41] society to create a Freer fair and more
[33:45] peaceful world and people go oh well
[33:47] that sounds pretty idealistic I don't
[33:48] think it can do that well yeah it's not
[33:50] going to do that in a second but the
[33:52] more we talk about it the more we plant
[33:55] seeds those seeds can start sprouting
[33:57] and they can start growing and you know
[34:00] and a forest doesn't happen you know all
[34:02] at the same time it's one tree after
[34:05] another tree after another tree and so
[34:08] the more we talk about it not just as
[34:11] some getrich quick scheme or get poor
[34:14] quick scheme um that people understand
[34:17] that it's really something more than
[34:19] that um and they begin to understand and
[34:22] you know I think most people and we're
[34:25] seeing this in our politics throughout
[34:26] the world most most people sense
[34:29] something is
[34:31] wrong you know we can feel it um it
[34:34] brings up the populism on one side to
[34:38] the other
[34:39] side and most politicians typically
[34:42] point at some reason why things are this
[34:47] way um that can appeal to a certain
[34:51] group of people um and quite usually it
[34:54] has nothing to do with the real problem
[34:57] um but it might be appealing in the
[34:59] short term and it can Inspire action and
[35:03] anger and fear and votes um but it
[35:06] doesn't solve the problems you know I've
[35:09] had to go through this journey myself um
[35:13] and to realize that sort of default
[35:16] assumptions and positions that I might
[35:18] have taken uh about right or left or
[35:22] people or leaders
[35:25] um they're all part of the problem
[35:28] some of them might talk a little bit
[35:30] better some of them might be a little
[35:31] more appealing but the fundamental
[35:34] nature of the
[35:36] system of a central bank Fiat system and
[35:41] a government system which is fueled by
[35:43] debt that allows it to spend more than
[35:46] the taxpayers would ever agree to spend
[35:50] that allows them to support their
[35:52] cronies in the you know the military
[35:55] industrial complex that seems to get us
[35:59] into NeverEnding Wars um you know if you
[36:03] had to check a box on a tax return that
[36:05] says let me donate an extra you know
[36:09] th000 EUR to the war in X Y or Z most
[36:14] people probably wouldn't do it and
[36:16] that's why the government doesn't do it
[36:18] anymore they don't try to float war
[36:20] bonds they don't try to to raise special
[36:24] purpose you know bonds for war
[36:26] activities because nobody would buy
[36:29] them um and so they can do that only
[36:33] because they have access to the money
[36:36] printer of central banks um so you know
[36:41] again I think everybody knows something
[36:43] is wrong we're at a turning point um
[36:46] there's lots of things to be concerned
[36:48] about but there's also tremendous
[36:52] opportunities and if we can
[36:54] begin I like to think of if we can begin
[36:57] to cut off the food supply of money from
[37:01] this
[37:02] Beast that is feeding things that most
[37:05] people really wouldn't want it to be
[37:08] feeding and if we can cut off the you
[37:11] know the crony government complex that
[37:13] fuels
[37:15] Industries on a rather unfair basis um
[37:20] we can begin to then think about and
[37:23] shift um our systems I mean you know we
[37:26] were supposed to have Alex gladin talks
[37:29] about this in the human rights
[37:30] Foundation we were supposed to have this
[37:32] Democratic peace dividend um where we
[37:36] had you know widespread peace when
[37:39] certain things
[37:41] shifted never seem to happen in fact
[37:44] we're spending more and more and more
[37:46] and more money uh on Wars you know we've
[37:51] got a we've got to figure out a way to
[37:52] solve that and sure people are going to
[37:55] have conflicts all right there's people
[37:57] who are not
[37:58] acting um you know nicely in the world
[38:03] um but fueling it through the
[38:07] military-industrial complex I mean in
[38:08] the United States Eisenhower warned
[38:11] about that the the general from World
[38:13] War 2 the supreme commander of the
[38:15] Allied Forces warned about that when he
[38:17] stepped down from office and warned
[38:19] about the the the Legacy the military
[38:22] industrial complex and I write about it
[38:24] in the book but he he actually said more
[38:26] than that that's very rarely quoted is
[38:29] that you know we will turn our society
[38:34] and our children's future in into a
[38:37] phantom of what it could be by expending
[38:39] more resources on things than than we
[38:42] have the capacity to do and I think
[38:45] we're we're getting to that point and so
[38:48] we have an opportunity and I'm for all
[38:51] the the talk about the
[38:53] problems I am
[38:55] incredibly optimistic and hopeful I know
[38:58] some people when I talk to them and I
[39:00] point out the problem say you know that
[39:02] sounds pretty bad
[39:04] no the the technology improvements
[39:07] artificial intelligence the the the
[39:10] networks that we have and ability to
[39:12] communicate throughout the world the
[39:14] Technologies like Bitcoin that can
[39:16] transfer value without extractive fees
[39:19] throughout the world I mean these are
[39:21] the foundations in which we can build a
[39:25] society where there will be much greater
[39:29] abundance for everyone potentially if we
[39:33] can get out of this inflationary system
[39:35] that just keeps making everything more
[39:37] expensive things should be getting
[39:39] cheaper with improved technology that
[39:41] abundance should allow us then to spend
[39:44] less time having to just work and more
[39:47] time being able to live more time in
[39:51] probing the deeper meanings of life and
[39:54] ultimately I think that's where you know
[39:56] that's the the point of my book or the
[39:59] end stage which is you know if we can
[40:00] get to that stage um and disperse the
[40:04] benefits of the technology improvements
[40:07] um we can probe what's really more
[40:09] meaningful in life we can love better we
[40:12] can live better and and we can try in
[40:15] our own way and whatever our tradition
[40:17] or our inclination
[40:19] is start working on for each of us that
[40:23] real question in life which is why am I
[40:26] here what's my place what's my purpose
[40:30] how do I fit in what is the meaning of
[40:32] life I mean it's something more than
[40:35] making a product or buying a car we all
[40:38] know that
[40:41] but if you can barely make ends meet and
[40:44] you got to spend all your time doing
[40:46] that you don't get to the important
[40:48] stuff and so my dream is that more
[40:51] people get the opportunity to get to the
[40:53] important stuff to dream a new dream to
[40:58] explore what's really important in life
[41:00] that's beautiful that's really cool and
[41:03] and and I've experienced that a little
[41:05] bit already um I'm not quite there yet I
[41:07] feel like uh but I as when I quit my job
[41:12] and and pursued this Bitcoin thing even
[41:13] though um I hadn't secured any income or
[41:17] anything like that I was like just going
[41:19] off of an experiment and see like okay
[41:21] like where can I take it I I had 400
[41:24] subscribers back then on YouTube so
[41:26] didn't had anything to really rely on
[41:28] but I still did it uh and I was so
[41:31] worried about money uh before I took the
[41:34] decision and since I took the decision I
[41:37] never was worried about money ever again
[41:39] not because I now make so much money
[41:41] just because I realized doing what I
[41:44] really like is so much more worth and
[41:48] funny enough on an absolute and hourly
[41:52] basis I now make more than before
[41:55] because I actually pursued something
[41:57] that I really like and pursued something
[41:59] that that I really enjoyed and this is
[42:02] what the um actual system rewards uh the
[42:07] not not the not the fear system but like
[42:10] like if you really want to add value to
[42:12] to humanity Humanity gives you more
[42:14] value back it's a it's it's a it's an
[42:17] interesting system it it is it is a
[42:19] self-reinforcing mechanism I mean you
[42:21] know what you give out comes back to you
[42:24] and and I'm not saying it's just as easy
[42:26] and it's it's not you know I'm not an
[42:28] Airy fairy Namby pamby kind of guy I'm a
[42:30] real grounded realistic this is this is
[42:32] reality kind of thing so there's many
[42:34] people that just say oh let me hope and
[42:36] pray for abundance to come into my life
[42:39] no you know you you do have to add value
[42:42] um I actually did a little uh trailer
[42:45] for the book The Little Instagram video
[42:47] recently and I said you know there was a
[42:48] book that came out in 1987 that said do
[42:51] what you love and the money will follow
[42:54] and that is an important thing and it's
[42:56] the idea that you are really doing what
[42:58] you love what you're passionate about
[43:00] what you're doing to add value often
[43:03] times as you've experienced that will
[43:05] come back to you and the money will
[43:07] follow what the piece it didn't talk
[43:10] about was yeah but in the Fiat monetary
[43:14] system somebody's picking your pocket
[43:17] even if the money does follow so it's
[43:20] much harder to just do what you love and
[43:22] move on even if the money does flow when
[43:26] your pockets got a big hole in it that
[43:28] you didn't even know was there that's a
[43:31] I love the picture of like someone is uh
[43:33] you you follow your dream you you you
[43:36] you make it but still someone is picking
[43:39] your pockets and obviously there are
[43:41] people that um don't don't don't see it
[43:44] that much and there are people that see
[43:45] it uh more but it's it's a it's a great
[43:48] way to look at it it's also really
[43:50] interesting of how this will overall
[43:53] affect Humanity if we set the right
[43:56] incentives to add value versus not
[43:58] extracting it uh of like I always I
[44:01] always compare
[44:02] Bitcoin a Bitcoin world of like there's
[44:05] a competition of proof of work and a
[44:08] competition of the best ideas versus in
[44:11] a feat world there's a competition who
[44:13] is closest to the money printer and what
[44:16] is possible once we have the incentive
[44:20] to actually add value to actually put
[44:22] the proof proof of work out and uh be
[44:26] rewarded uh for for the best ideas and
[44:28] the best execution and not be sto stole
[44:31] not be pickpocket by that and having
[44:34] incentive to be closer to
[44:36] manter yes absolutely and and so you
[44:39] know if if we're adding value and and
[44:42] the market and other people see that
[44:44] value and everybody's going to have a
[44:45] you know a different attribution of
[44:47] value I mean Carl merer said you know uh
[44:50] something to effect I mean of um How
[44:52] does it go uh you know value is a
[44:55] reflection of your conscious State okay
[44:58] there's no independent value out there
[45:00] it depends upon our Consciousness so
[45:03] what we value is a reflection of our
[45:05] Consciousness as I said earlier and you
[45:08] know some people may do things that are
[45:10] of Great Value in the market you know to
[45:12] themselves and the market may not value
[45:14] that that way and that's a learning
[45:17] experience for them um and they can
[45:19] decide what to do with that it may be of
[45:22] great value and it's so much of value
[45:25] that they'll leave
[45:27] lifestyle that allows them to do that
[45:31] even if it may not be a lifestyle of as
[45:33] much abundance as some others that's
[45:36] okay you know um it's not about who can
[45:40] get the most
[45:43] wins again we all know that but so many
[45:46] people seem to just be playing that game
[45:49] um and again it's not a fix for
[45:53] everything um but you know we can begin
[45:57] to make the messaging a lot better if
[46:00] the system that transmit the messages
[46:03] transmits them clearly and cleanly
[46:05] instead of depleting them and siphoning
[46:08] them
[46:09] off and you know I think that's what the
[46:12] the Bitcoin system you know is a step in
[46:15] the right direction for um but it it
[46:20] takes all of us to begin thinking about
[46:22] things differently and you know I think
[46:24] we all you know there's a lot of people
[46:26] in this space who are leaders who made a
[46:29] lot of money very early on if I listened
[46:31] to my wife maybe I'd be one of them but
[46:33] I'm not but the the the point is that
[46:39] you know we see all those people out
[46:41] there that are just busting it
[46:45] struggling just to make ends meet who
[46:48] are adding as much value as they can as
[46:52] much time as they can you know working
[46:54] at jobs that that might be where their
[46:57] skills are right now might be what
[46:59] they've been programmed to do might be
[47:01] because they've got big debt burdens you
[47:04] know from the educational industrial
[47:06] complex or from a a complex that's you
[47:09] know selling them a a car or a phone
[47:12] beyond their resources and and so they
[47:14] got to just you know do two or three
[47:17] jobs and struggling to pay for child
[47:19] care Etc I mean those are the people
[47:21] that are really hurting
[47:24] and just having the government hand them
[47:26] check
[47:28] um sounds like a nice idea but you know
[47:31] we all know it's fake money so that's
[47:35] not a solution but bringing prices down
[47:38] to make life easier because you don't
[47:41] have you know and money with that's not
[47:46] authentic is a better solution than
[47:49] keeping a crappy money system and just
[47:53] handing more crappy money out to people
[47:56] to try to not have them all Revolt let's
[47:59] let's do a revolution of love I love
[48:01] that Revolution of Love it's also the
[48:03] the the free market aspect is is
[48:06] sometimes hard because like um there are
[48:09] some aspects where it's really showing
[48:11] for example uh social media I think it's
[48:13] it's something that um is is kind of
[48:16] giving you live live feedback of the the
[48:20] the free market uh especially on YouTube
[48:23] especially on on on platforms where you
[48:25] have good analytics of like okay how
[48:27] many people clicked on your thumbnail
[48:29] and how long did the people actually
[48:31] watch your thing and some like oh I
[48:33] really enjoyed that uh that talk and you
[48:36] see the average FR duration is like half
[48:38] as long as usual and like okay people
[48:40] actually didn't enjoy it that much so I
[48:42] was enjoying it but the free market
[48:44] tells me it's not that good of a
[48:45] conversation so it it's sometimes hard
[48:48] to get the feedback of the free market
[48:51] um but it's better to get a nondistorted
[48:55] feedback of the free market with Bitcoin
[48:58] versus a distorted feedback of the free
[49:00] market with the Fiat system where the
[49:02] market is not really completely free if
[49:04] Capital itself is not free so uh but but
[49:09] a totally free market is also uh not not
[49:13] all not all good I like it but I think
[49:17] uh people like the the thing like it's
[49:20] good that there's someone above me like
[49:22] they they feel Comfort uh with that with
[49:25] the field system with the banking system
[49:26] system um and and I'm often wondering
[49:30] how how does this look how this will
[49:32] look like on on a Bitcoin standard
[49:34] because for me it's in inevitable that
[49:36] we get to a Bitcoin standard but it's
[49:39] there's a lot of question mark of like
[49:41] how will this look like for for people
[49:43] no you're absolutely right and I think
[49:45] this transition period is you know is
[49:48] critical um you know there's there's two
[49:52] ways this the systems can go I think you
[49:55] know it can concentrate power and
[49:58] centralization and
[50:00] control and will have a certain
[50:02] different sort of lifestyle and we see
[50:04] that in certain places throughout the
[50:06] world um you know or we can shift more
[50:10] to a Freer and balanced Market but you
[50:13] know capitalism has gotten is such a
[50:16] portive now it has such a bad reputation
[50:19] as being this extractive system well and
[50:23] crony capitalism which we have I don't
[50:27] care whether you're in the US or Europe
[50:29] or you know socialist capitalist States
[50:32] you know the people close to the money
[50:34] printer the people in control all right
[50:37] um are are getting the benefits out of
[50:39] the system which you would not in a pure
[50:42] free market um you know different
[50:44] cultures are going to have
[50:47] different points on a spectrum all right
[50:51] um as to where they may fall in between
[50:54] you know having a larger
[50:57] community that pulls together to address
[51:00] certain issues um and provide safety
[51:03] nets and things like that others May
[51:05] lean in another Direction you know I
[51:08] think one of the big issues that is very
[51:11] interesting is you know how will the
[51:14] whole nation state system evolve you
[51:17] know this is a relatively new phenomenon
[51:19] you know most nations were carved up as
[51:22] a result of wars and people who you know
[51:25] won and divided up territories they
[51:28] don't always reflect a common interest
[51:30] of people um they don't always reflect
[51:33] common markets and thoughts um you know
[51:36] do we go to a globalist One World System
[51:40] you know at some one point that sounded
[51:42] like it might be better uh or have some
[51:45] advantages and now we're seeing some of
[51:48] the great disadvantages of control
[51:51] structures being uh offloaded to many
[51:55] unelected bureaucrats were in places who
[51:58] want to decide what's best for you you
[52:00] know uh you will own nothing and you
[52:02] will be happy um that sort of thing um
[52:05] and yet you know we live in a different
[52:08] world than when we had small tribal
[52:11] communities that didn't even need
[52:13] something called money um because we
[52:17] shared our gifts and talents without the
[52:19] need in the small tribal Community
[52:21] without the need for that technology
[52:23] where it will go um I think is something
[52:26] that's worthy of discussing and talking
[52:28] about um I don't think anybody can say
[52:32] uh oh we've already come up with the
[52:34] absolute perfect solution in the
[52:37] existing countries that we have and
[52:39] nation states that we have and the way
[52:41] they operate um it's worthy of dialogue
[52:44] yeah and that's that's the interesting
[52:46] interesting fear of like how will nation
[52:48] states end up they have a lot of power
[52:51] because of the money printer uh like
[52:56] how how will humans evolve it's also
[52:59] like it's fun to to think about that
[53:01] like because if we have a whole new
[53:03] system it's almost like we have a chance
[53:06] of reassembling ourselves uh our social
[53:10] structures because I do think there's
[53:12] value in having some sort of social
[53:16] structure where we say okay like it
[53:19] doesn't make sense to have safety nets
[53:21] for for people with disabilities for
[53:23] example it does have like I'm I'm not a
[53:27] fan of
[53:29] total uh a total
[53:31] Anarchy uh systems where we don't have
[53:34] any structures maybe it works I had some
[53:37] guests on that that they kind of make
[53:39] the argument for like why it would work
[53:41] better than like the the current system
[53:44] but the current system it's so flawed
[53:45] it's it's not that hard uh but I I do
[53:48] think there there there will probably be
[53:50] some sort of of structure of of um uh
[53:54] social structure that that that we kind
[53:57] of need and and
[53:59] want but now we are at the other side
[54:02] where uh the the state is way too big
[54:07] like not a little like like way too big
[54:09] H and uh it's interesting how I slowly
[54:12] see the the pendul pendulum swing back
[54:16] when we see things like Doge in America
[54:18] but also see it around all the European
[54:20] countries the governments are more and
[54:23] more talking about they have to cut back
[54:25] spending
[54:26] uh they have to cut back because
[54:28] otherwise they default on their depths
[54:31] and uh they always default because like
[54:33] it's it's made up but it it's a problem
[54:36] if if you default more than the other
[54:38] count so like you you have this this
[54:40] kind of like competition between like
[54:43] you actually have to cut back a little
[54:45] because we we spent just way too too
[54:47] much so it's interesting how it already
[54:49] started this process of like shrinking
[54:52] governments yeah yeah well in addition
[54:54] to being in traditional Finance before I
[54:56] got into that I actually spent 15 years
[54:59] in federal and state government so I
[55:00] know that side also um and you know I
[55:04] was well-meaning at the time I think I
[55:06] did good work most of the people around
[55:07] me were doing the best were really
[55:10] trying to add value and believe
[55:12] passionately I was in the environmental
[55:13] field and and believed passionately in
[55:15] what they were doing and did a lot of
[55:16] good work you know and in time I can
[55:19] reflect back on that experience um and
[55:22] see issues associated with it and as
[55:25] government has grown even since I've
[55:27] left um more and more you know uh
[55:31] control and
[55:32] bureaucracy I think it's an opportunity
[55:34] to reflect and I don't do that you know
[55:36] from that as to say that anarco
[55:39] capitalist uh sort of um role and I
[55:42] think this is the other thing that we
[55:44] need to realize because there's so much
[55:46] talk in in this space and others about
[55:49] sovereignty you know individual
[55:51] sovereignty um and yes we are all Unique
[55:57] Individuals with our own gifts and
[55:59] talents our own expression of life and
[56:01] that should be respected and honored by
[56:06] everyone
[56:08] and we live in an interconnected web of
[56:11] 8 billion people and if you think you
[56:14] live all alone with no connection to
[56:16] anything
[56:17] else um the DSM and psychology would
[56:21] call that delusions of
[56:23] grandeur um so you know the balance is
[56:27] the issue where is it between
[56:30] respecting that
[56:32] individual and understanding we operate
[56:37] within a community it's individuality
[56:40] within
[56:42] plurality they're two sides of the same
[56:44] coin um if you're all one way or you're
[56:47] all the other way you're not very
[56:49] balanced and we end up with
[56:51] problems so um you know where that mix
[56:55] is may be different for different
[56:57] communities different cultures different
[56:59] individuals and that's okay um but again
[57:04] it's something that's worthy of having
[57:06] deeper dialogue and thought and I think
[57:08] as we move away from an old system and
[57:12] build a new system you know there's and
[57:14] I use it in the book uh uh the futurist
[57:17] uh R Buckminster Fuller I said you know
[57:20] you you don't build a new system just by
[57:24] tearing down the old
[57:26] you create a new system to make the old
[57:28] one
[57:29] Obsolete and so the question is how do
[57:32] we create that new system that everybody
[57:36] is attracted to everybody sees it as a
[57:39] better system and you make the old
[57:42] system obsolete in doing so I mean email
[57:46] made you know snail mail relatively
[57:51] obsolete the PC made typewriters
[57:54] obsolete because they built a better
[57:56] system all right I think we as as
[58:00] Humanity can build better systems
[58:03] there's a lot of
[58:04] forces um that are fighting against that
[58:07] that are
[58:08] entrenched um
[58:11] governments technology monopolies
[58:14] centralized forces I also talk in the
[58:16] book there's a an author deceased now
[58:19] Neil Postman who wrote a lot about
[58:20] technology and I think it's a big issue
[58:22] for us um but one of the things he said
[58:25] is in in in shifting some of the value
[58:28] structures around
[58:29] technology um and and very briefly I
[58:31] just say you know technology is more
[58:34] from being a tool I mean we built a
[58:36] hammer to make our job of building a
[58:39] house better then we had this technology
[58:43] of a
[58:44] telescope which did more than help us do
[58:48] you know be a better tool it
[58:51] fundamentally changed our perspective of
[58:55] how we fit into the universe no longer
[58:58] was the earth the center of the universe
[59:00] and everything revolved around us it
[59:02] changed our whole framework and now
[59:05] we're morphing into a technopoly as he
[59:08] calls it um where we're almost now in
[59:11] service to
[59:14] technology and so you know when we think
[59:18] about these
[59:19] systems um he says and I agree I think
[59:22] that we need to think about being loving
[59:25] resistant Fighters not just Fighters
[59:28] there's a lot of people who are fighting
[59:30] all right you know that's not it has its
[59:34] place but if you can be a loving
[59:35] resistance fighter to point out the new
[59:38] systems to resist Central Bank digital
[59:41] currencies to to move from centralized
[59:43] platforms to things like Noster to move
[59:46] to more private you know email servers
[59:49] and systems you know from the ones that
[59:51] are just handed to you through Google
[59:53] and Gmail so they can monitor everything
[59:55] you do you know if we can begin to
[59:57] resist and shift away we can begin to
[60:00] create you know new systems in ways that
[60:04] that don't have to be through huge
[60:07] conflict um I I I love
[60:11] that there are two ways and I it's a
[60:14] quote that I learned from from Gary ve
[60:16] but I will um uh model it a little bit
[60:20] to to that one now uh he said like there
[60:24] are two ways to uh to to build the
[60:27] biggest uh Tower in your city the the
[60:30] first way is build an average high tower
[60:32] and and te tear all the other towers
[60:35] down the the second way is like build
[60:38] the biggest tower in the city and it's
[60:41] it it's probably similar when we look at
[60:43] the the Bitcoin system we we can speak
[60:48] bad about MasterCard we can speak bad
[60:50] about uh the field system and and it's
[60:53] it's great if if we want to tear that
[60:55] system down
[60:56] but what's way better is building
[61:00] Bitcoin and the ecosystem and and all
[61:03] those things so good that it's the best
[61:07] system in town and everyone wants to
[61:10] come to the system like that kind of
[61:12] fighting and building towards a better
[61:14] system is way better use of our human
[61:17] resources versus uh trying to tear down
[61:20] the fear system they will tear
[61:22] themselves anyway down if we have the
[61:24] best system yeah and I think you see
[61:27] that playing out in most of us in the
[61:30] developed quote unquote it's a rather
[61:32] insulting term um West in in in in the
[61:35] global South when Bitcoin adoption is
[61:38] just for transaction purposes is just
[61:42] occurring naturally in unbanked
[61:44] communities in in in communities that
[61:46] are subject to high fee structures
[61:48] towards terrible you know currencies
[61:51] Central African Frank you know huge
[61:53] inflationary currencies when you know
[61:56] with the one piece of technology then
[61:57] they have in their hand a simple phone
[61:59] you can conduct transactions when you
[62:02] can conduct transactions without
[62:04] government control and and move money
[62:06] against uh authoritarian actors when uh
[62:11] women are being able to be empowered um
[62:14] through the work that they're doing and
[62:15] being able to have their own security
[62:18] and source of money I mean these are
[62:20] just natural evolutionary things that
[62:22] are occurring in the Bitcoin system um
[62:26] that those of us who don't have to worry
[62:27] about those things cuz we can just whip
[62:29] out our Visa card um you know don't have
[62:32] to deal with but when those billions of
[62:37] people begin adopting this system um you
[62:41] know that's where the real power can
[62:44] come from and that's where its natural
[62:46] and organic um growth can come from I
[62:50] mean those are immaculately
[62:53] conceived uh as Bitcoin has said to Say
[62:56] by by Satoshi you know those are
[62:58] immaculately conceived uses of it um
[63:02] that help build that bigger
[63:06] building um in the center of town
[63:09] because it's just a better system it's
[63:12] it's amazing yeah like I had um and I
[63:15] was actually only really aware of that
[63:17] problem it was aware of the problem
[63:19] before but she made it so aware to me an
[63:22] African woman Sena had on my podcast
[63:25] think like a month or maybe two months
[63:27] ago and she told that story of how she
[63:33] uh wasn't able to have her own bank
[63:35] account because every time she spent she
[63:37] needed the permission of the husband and
[63:40] that's uh that's normal also like a job
[63:43] you you don't get that easily and
[63:46] Bitcoin just gives her so simply the
[63:50] ability to have her own bank uh and to
[63:54] have her own account whereing she can
[63:56] spend and and receive money uh and it's
[63:58] those small things that I Austrian
[64:01] brought in in that in that Western uh
[64:05] World never even thought about because
[64:07] like here in Austria everyone has a bank
[64:09] account like if you're 16 years old you
[64:11] probably have a bank account you get a
[64:13] bank account very early and there's like
[64:16] a bank a bank rate of like 99% or
[64:19] something like that so there's no
[64:21] problem Austria giving a little bit of a
[64:24] wider Horizon and and seeing the
[64:26] problems outside of the European Union
[64:29] uh the European Union has a lot of
[64:30] problems also but other different kinds
[64:32] of problems um makes you think like oh
[64:36] like that there are some real use cases
[64:39] outside of just storing money yeah well
[64:41] you know I mean Alex gladstein from the
[64:43] human rights foundation and check your
[64:45] financial privilege and and you read
[64:47] that book you hear these stories and we
[64:49] go yeah got to check that Financial
[64:51] privilege because we don't live in in
[64:54] the you know and we're very fortunate we
[64:55] don't live in those uh structures to
[64:58] understand the depth of some of the
[65:00] issues that they're facing but when you
[65:02] see that this simple technology can have
[65:07] such a revolutionary effect um on
[65:11] cultures and economies and people and
[65:13] society and relationships and things um
[65:16] it's uh it's it's amazing it really is
[65:19] and it that's why I I say you know it
[65:23] takes some time you usually um talk a
[65:26] lot when you're in this space about the
[65:28] ills of the current system um to get
[65:30] people to become aware of it um and if
[65:33] they stop there you know they can get
[65:35] kind of
[65:36] depressed um and it sounds pretty
[65:39] pessimistic but you just have to get
[65:41] over that mountain to the other side to
[65:43] realize that there is a Promised Land
[65:45] There is this land where so many amazing
[65:49] things are happening um you know there's
[65:51] some who say Africa's going to you know
[65:53] lead and whether it is just know the
[65:56] work of of Mining and and being able to
[65:59] bring electricity to communities that
[66:00] are otherwise unaffordable and tear down
[66:03] these you know insane IMF and you know
[66:06] World Bank massive projects that just
[66:10] siphon money off and make these
[66:12] countries debt
[66:13] slaves um you know it it's uh it's
[66:17] really a reason for a lot of optimism
[66:20] and more stories that need to be told so
[66:23] I try to tell some of that in in the
[66:25] book
[66:26] when people
[66:27] think it's just some getrich quick
[66:31] scheme no interesting like it it's it's
[66:35] it's so fundamental um really really
[66:38] cool I have I have one question that I
[66:40] asked each and every one of my guests
[66:41] and the question is what can we learn
[66:43] from you besides Bitcoin yeah um
[66:47] ultimately I I think it is to gain a
[66:52] greater awareness to step back from the
[66:54] day to day and the mundane all the
[66:57] things that trap us in life regardless
[67:00] of our financial position um to become a
[67:03] little more self-reflective and
[67:06] self-aware again through whatever
[67:08] practice May resonate through whatever
[67:09] tradition May resonate and to realize
[67:12] there's a lot more to life all right
[67:15] than what the advertising industry or
[67:19] all these giant Industries project out
[67:22] to us is going to make us happy because
[67:25] that are in our hearts we know they
[67:27] won't but we don't get the opportunity
[67:30] or we don't take the time to really
[67:33] check in as much um with our heart with
[67:37] our s with our own deeper awareness of
[67:40] what's important in life and what is our
[67:42] place beyond going to work you know
[67:45] filling the car up with gas and taking
[67:48] care of the kids um you know if we all
[67:51] spend a little more time doing that uh
[67:53] and be a little more self-reflective
[67:55] go on that path um and take that Journey
[67:59] then I think we can come back to the
[68:01] external world with a little stronger
[68:04] and more grounded and rooted place in
[68:08] understanding the truth that is within
[68:09] us not the truth that is told To Us by
[68:13] others really interesting yeah
[68:15] absolutely it's it's so so important I
[68:18] love that um really cool we have an and
[68:23] it's always a shame like cutting those
[68:25] conversations off like I feel like we
[68:26] could go for another two hours today uh
[68:29] but uh um we have endro on the podcast
[68:32] where the previous guest is asking a
[68:33] question uh for the next guest without
[68:36] knowing who the next guest actually is
[68:38] and uh the question from from the
[68:40] previous guest is what is for you still
[68:43] missing in Bitcoin um well I I think the
[68:48] Technologies need to continue to evolve
[68:50] to make um on ramping and custody more
[68:55] simple um and yet still allow for self-
[68:59] custody I mean those things are evolving
[69:02] um you know it used to be that you felt
[69:03] like you had to be some sort of a techno
[69:06] wiiz or a coder um and and people shut
[69:09] down at that it's getting easier and
[69:11] easier um but I think more and more
[69:13] systems will develop to make it just
[69:16] like you know I mean 10 years ago you'd
[69:19] never think about holding up your phone
[69:20] to pay a transaction now you can do it
[69:23] with your visa and you can do it with
[69:24] your Bitcoin
[69:25] but just making that on ramping a little
[69:28] easier and I think that's coming very
[69:30] soon um and then bringing more of this
[69:32] discussion into it that it's not about
[69:35] the regulation it's not about getting
[69:37] rich quick it's ultimately about um
[69:41] making a more loving and peaceful system
[69:44] and making people realize the potential
[69:47] uh of this when they
[69:49] realize the the problems uh and the
[69:52] fraudulent nature uh of the existing
[69:54] system
[69:56] so absolutely yeah I love that and is we
[70:00] we we have a very I think important job
[70:03] as to educate and and thank you so much
[70:05] for being voice in that space because we
[70:09] need as many different perspective on on
[70:12] bitcoin to to actually win that that's
[70:14] the whole purpose of the podcast of
[70:16] doing it seven times per week and doing
[70:18] so many different guests to have fill
[70:20] out those those different voices and not
[70:23] having like 50 guests and like have them
[70:26] all over again every year it it that
[70:28] would not make sense for me it feels
[70:30] like absolutely and that that's a real
[70:33] value ad and I appreciate that and honor
[70:36] that in in what you're doing to
[70:38] disseminate uh all those different
[70:40] voices and their different ideas and
[70:42] expertises in this space um and I
[70:45] appreciate the opportunity to to be one
[70:47] of those um and if people want more
