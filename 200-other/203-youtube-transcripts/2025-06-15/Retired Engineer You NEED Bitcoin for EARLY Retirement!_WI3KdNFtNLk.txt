[00:00] you better have your money in Bitcoin
[00:02] how do I ensure that in my last years of
[00:05] my life I can go where I want do what I
[00:07] want when I want and I'll have money to
[00:10] do it dear God of volatility thank you
[00:12] very much for bringing the number goes
[00:14] up if the United States government wants
[00:16] to they can't screw with me too bad when
[00:18] I sold my house I had more money and
[00:21] smash bought Bitcoin how many Bitcoin do
[00:23] I have to accumulate to retire one day
[00:26] the first thing somebody has to do if
[00:28] they want to retire well is tire without
[00:31] debt if a major Black Swan event happens
[00:34] and all the banks decide they want to
[00:36] close and freeze your funds what are you
[00:38] going to do well with Bitcoin you've got
[00:40] freedom if you only got one passport you
[00:42] don't own it your government turns it on
[00:44] and off just like a cbdc so if they want
[00:47] you to come home they just say your
[00:49] passport is not valid no country in the
[00:51] world will let you in the number goes up
[00:52] quicker and I can spend it I'm trying to
[00:54] die broke cuz it isn't the one who dies
[00:57] with the most toys wins it's the guy who
[01:00] dies with the most memories and the most
[01:02] laughs and the best time this is a debt
[01:05] driven Society the countries are in debt
[01:08] the states are in debt the cities are in
[01:10] debt the people are in debt all you have
[01:12] to do to get ahead in this life is get
[01:14] yourself out of God damn debt debt
[01:17] equals Death what they should have did
[01:19] in 2008 during the great financial
[01:21] crisis they should let some of them
[01:23] Banks
[01:24] [Music]
[01:26] fail you know on on the first day day
[01:30] after Joe Biden was elected to office
[01:33] and he took office on January 20th of
[01:37] 2020 and on January 21st I said that's
[01:42] it I'm out of here so I so I I sold
[01:46] everything I owned it take took me 18
[01:50] months and by 18 months I was totally
[01:53] divested of
[01:54] everything and my whole thing was how do
[01:57] I become free I want to be free I want
[02:01] to live my life I've always lived my
[02:03] life with freedom in
[02:06] mind and Bitcoin wasn't the first thing
[02:10] it was the freedom was the first thing
[02:13] and then I obtained a second citizenship
[02:16] for
[02:18] $130,000 on citizenship by
[02:21] investment and then I said how do I
[02:24] maintain my freedom because I want to go
[02:27] to where I'm treated best sort of the
[02:30] old Nomad capitalist routine and I want
[02:33] to make sure by having a second passport
[02:36] in that so Bitcoin came to me as how do
[02:41] I make sure that tyrannical government
[02:44] doesn't up the last part of my life
[02:48] okay I want I want to know that if the
[02:51] United States government wants to they
[02:53] can't screw with me too bad they could
[02:55] get a little bit but they ain't get much
[02:58] they can take away your passport see if
[03:00] you only got one passport you don't own
[03:03] it your government turns it on and off
[03:05] just like a
[03:07] cbdc so if they want you to come home
[03:10] they just say your passport is not valid
[03:12] no country in the world will let you in
[03:14] so I wanted make sure I was free and
[03:17] when I turned around I said well how do
[03:18] I guarantee that I can go anywhere in
[03:20] the world and have
[03:22] money then I started doing my research
[03:25] into Bitcoin which you know I had
[03:28] already poo pooed in 20133 when it was
[03:31] brought to me as being something stupid
[03:34] so I'd already said oh that's a Ponzi
[03:36] scheme I just dismissed it and blah blah
[03:39] blah dumb dumb dumb but in 2020 I
[03:43] started saying I want to be I want to
[03:46] make sure that I can go I have a
[03:49] three-day plan what happens if the world
[03:52] takes a dump on your life what would you
[03:55] do where would you go in three days I've
[03:58] got the plan
[04:01] okay as long as there's an airline to
[04:03] get me there I've got a
[04:05] plan so that's what I really want to
[04:08] touch on is the Bitcoin to me is freedom
[04:12] yeah I love to pray to the god of
[04:15] volatility uh I pray to him every day I
[04:18] thank him for number goes up that's all
[04:20] well and good but more importantly than
[04:24] anything is that I can cross in the
[04:26] borders and go to any one of 20
[04:29] countries I have already lined up that I
[04:31] can stay in how did you come to that
[04:33] because you said like you thought it's a
[04:35] scam it's thought you thought it's a
[04:37] pyramid scheme well like I said in
[04:41] 2021 I said or in 2020 I said I'm gonna
[04:44] get out here and it took me 18 months I
[04:47] bought a second citizenship by
[04:49] investment which cost about 130,000 at
[04:52] the time from a East Caribbean Community
[04:56] country called St Lucia but I wanted to
[04:59] make sure that I could be
[05:01] free and I did not I no longer trusted
[05:05] the United States government because
[05:08] they no longer go by the rule of law in
[05:10] the United States they turn the law into
[05:13] a weapon against political opponents
[05:15] which I never thought would have
[05:18] happened and uh they're using that uh
[05:22] laware right now to to to silence people
[05:27] censorships at an all-time high
[05:30] the freezing of assets I think is is a
[05:34] total possibility at any time that's why
[05:38] I keep less
[05:39] than 10% of my liquid net worth in Fiat
[05:44] currencies and that's broken down
[05:46] between the United States dollar and the
[05:49] Thai bot where I'm in
[05:51] Thailand but I keep less than 10% there
[05:54] the rest is all in Bitcoin uh or it's in
[05:57] Bitcoin derivatives because I'm I'm a
[05:59] firm believer that as long as you're
[06:01] still going to be a US citizen they have
[06:03] something called a Roth IRA and if you
[06:06] have a Roth IRA any profits that you
[06:09] make and anything in that Ira will never
[06:13] ever ever be
[06:15] taxed you can make profits you can trade
[06:17] whatever and within that Roth IRA you
[06:20] can hold Bitcoin you can hold Bitcoin
[06:22] ETFs you can hold micro strategy stock
[06:25] you can hold uh Mara uh Mining stock you
[06:29] can hold anything Bitcoin related you
[06:32] want in the in the ETF for tax advantage
[06:36] because it'll never be taxed under the
[06:38] US law if you're still a US citizen but
[06:42] I really wanted to find
[06:44] Freedom at the time I said you I don't
[06:47] trust the US government I don't trust
[06:49] the banks I put out a uh a
[06:53] YouTube video on fractional Reserve
[06:56] banking back in 2020 and it was my
[06:59] biggest video of all time on number of
[07:02] views out of the you I only had like a
[07:05] hundred subscribers and it did like
[07:07] almost 60,000 views which was amazing on
[07:13] uh first I did
[07:15] the the uh the W Yan from China being
[07:20] used to buy oil and then I did the fact
[07:23] that fractional Reserve banking for 400
[07:27] years has been killing the banking
[07:29] system the bank the banks are
[07:31] gangsters so I don't trust them so I
[07:34] said how do I ensure that my last years
[07:37] of my life I can go where I want do what
[07:40] I want when I want and I'll have money
[07:43] to do
[07:44] it and there's nowhere else you can put
[07:47] your money and do that you can't buy
[07:51] property you can't take property with
[07:54] you you can't property comes with
[07:56] insurance rates that go up every every
[07:59] month or every year every time you renew
[08:02] a policy it costs more you have to
[08:04] maintain the property you have to pay
[08:06] tax on the
[08:07] property every month so I said where am
[08:11] I going to put money that I
[08:15] trust so I looked into places like
[08:17] Singapore precious metal exchange where
[08:20] you can actually buy gold and put in
[08:22] this vault in Singapore and this Vault
[08:25] looks like it's something off a James
[08:26] Bond movie they hold Gaz billions of
[08:30] dollars worth of gold and platinum and
[08:33] silver in this place in Singapore I
[08:36] looked at that and I said well that's
[08:38] that's all right but now you got all
[08:41] your wealth in in someplace in
[08:43] Singapore which is is a safe place it's
[08:47] a good Hub uh probably one of the best
[08:50] governments in the world by the way if
[08:52] you didn't know Singapore probably pays
[08:55] legitimately pays their politicians
[08:58] better than any other country in the
[09:00] world you can actually have a good
[09:02] salary as a
[09:04] politician uh a competitive commercial
[09:08] grade type salary and consequently they
[09:11] don't have the corruption and and
[09:13] they're known as the you know
[09:16] Switzerland of the southeast Asia you
[09:18] know that doesn't solve the bill but
[09:20] Bitcoin
[09:21] did so I started buying Bitcoin after I
[09:26] did my research and I did hundreds of
[09:29] hours of
[09:30] research I mean even before I bought the
[09:34] first little bit and then I went into
[09:37] dollar cost averaging every single day
[09:40] every single day I had
[09:42] programmable buy and then when it went
[09:45] down low I just smash by and when it
[09:48] went lower I'd smash by again it didn't
[09:51] matter I took Michael sers it's never a
[09:54] bad time to buy
[09:56] Bitcoin and you know when I sold my
[09:58] house I
[10:00] had more money and smash bought
[10:04] Bitcoin uh luckily my house actually
[10:06] sold in in June of 2022 which wasn't a
[10:10] horrible time to have a a little bit of
[10:12] money to to buy Bitcoin with but my
[10:16] whole answer
[10:18] is with
[10:20] Bitcoin you can be
[10:23] free and you know the thing I'd like to
[10:26] convey to people is you don't don't have
[10:29] to stay where you were born you were
[10:32] born in a country wherever that is you
[10:35] don't have to stay there and you don't
[10:37] have to move to a town next to you you
[10:39] don't have to move to the state or
[10:41] Province near you you can move to
[10:43] another
[10:44] country and uh I moved over here and I
[10:49] was planning to travel but I loved it
[10:50] here and this I'm living in a pool Villa
[10:55] that I know would
[10:57] cost 8,000 a month month if it was in a
[11:01] similar location in Florida and the
[11:03] United States and I'm paying 2,000 a
[11:06] month I'm mooving to one that just got
[11:08] completed that's even bigger with even a
[11:11] bigger pool and it's it's gorgeous I'm
[11:15] I'm still paying like $22,100 a month so
[11:19] you can live in other parts of the
[11:23] world and you can take your money with
[11:26] you if it if you're living on a Bitcoin
[11:28] standard
[11:30] and
[11:32] everything gets cheaper on bitcoin
[11:34] standard I watched a YouTube video the
[11:37] other day a guy was saying that he got
[11:39] super deal here in Thailand on a
[11:42] six-bedroom six bath Poolville he did I
[11:45] I met him I went over there I talked
[11:48] with him I saw it it's beautiful place
[11:50] and he got this deal by paying a whole
[11:52] year in advance he got a super
[11:55] deal but then I put down on an sell
[11:59] sheet on my channel mark- Hanah on
[12:03] YouTube and I did a whole video on I
[12:06] said if you just keep your money in
[12:07] Bitcoin and pay the rent every month if
[12:11] Bitcoin during this bull run goes up
[12:14] like this you're going to end up paying
[12:17] 40% of the rent that you actually paid
[12:20] because everything gets cheaper on
[12:22] bitcoin standard and if it goes up even
[12:25] more you're going to do better goes up a
[12:27] little less you're going to do a little
[12:28] bit less but you are in the middle of a
[12:31] bull run so why why pay a whole year up
[12:35] front if you can keep your money now
[12:37] this
[12:38] weekend when you're making this it was
[12:42] Bitcoin was struggling to hang into
[12:45] $60,000 and right now as I look it's at
[12:48] $664,000
[12:50] 77 you take your money out of
[12:53] Bitcoin and you lost about seven 8% jump
[12:59] over a weekend I went to bed on Friday
[13:02] night woke up Saturday morning it was up
[13:05] like
[13:06] 3,000 from where I've got a little
[13:08] screen a little iPad that sits on the on
[13:11] the on the Shelf over here and displays
[13:15] bitcoin price all the time so you keep
[13:18] your money in Bitcoin you peel off just
[13:20] enough that you can live that's all you
[13:23] need to do and uh you pray to the god of
[13:26] volatility oh dear God of volatility
[13:29] thank you very much for bringing the
[13:31] number goes up amen say
[13:34] hallelujah so Hallelujah you just you
[13:38] just you just stay with it and and you
[13:42] you know if somebody tell shows me an
[13:44] asset that performs better than
[13:47] Bitcoin I may change but then again
[13:51] we're an unstable world you got wars in
[13:55] the Middle East you've got aggress of
[13:59] China that would really love to have
[14:02] Taiwan in its back pocket and people
[14:05] rattling Sabers over there you got North
[14:08] Korea you got Russia you know trying to
[14:11] invade Ukraine and Ukraine trying to
[14:13] invade Russia there's a lot of stuff
[14:15] going on we don't know what Black Swan
[14:18] event will happen but if you want to
[14:21] escape all
[14:23] that you know the one thing that all of
[14:26] those these things have in common that
[14:28] they're the Northern Hemisphere perhaps
[14:31] if the hits a fan you want to go to
[14:34] Chile maybe you want to go to
[14:37] Argentina maybe you want to go somewhere
[14:40] else but when you do you want to have
[14:42] money when you get there and if a major
[14:46] Black Swan event happens and all the
[14:48] banks decide they want to close and
[14:51] freeze your funds what are you g to
[14:54] do well with
[14:56] Bitcoin you've got freedom and we're
[14:59] built on a house of debt uh and there's
[15:02] no other second best asset I'm sure you
[15:05] watched Mark moss and he just came out
[15:08] with this YouTube video on the black
[15:11] hole and it's
[15:13] basically the black hole of other asset
[15:17] Investments and the best the second best
[15:21] was the NASDAQ and that only kept your
[15:23] head barely above the debasement of the
[15:26] US dollar and inflation
[15:30] just barely I I mean he does a really
[15:32] good job of explaining it you know he
[15:34] puts out a beautiful video and uh people
[15:38] should watch it but there is no second
[15:42] best investment to put your money in
[15:44] especially if you want to be able to
[15:46] pick up pack your bags grab a plane grab
[15:50] a boat and get the hell out of wherever
[15:52] you're
[15:53] at now I'm in Thailand it's got stable
[15:56] government but in 2014 they had military
[16:01] coup it's got a relatively stable
[16:04] government now I mean I don't expect
[16:07] anything's ever that anything's going to
[16:09] go bad but if it did I'd want to get out
[16:11] of here and I'd want to have money when
[16:14] I
[16:15] go
[16:17] so I'm not going to trust the fact that
[16:21] the Fiat bank is going to be open or
[16:25] willing to give me my
[16:27] money and that's the reason reason
[16:29] why uh Bitcoin jumped up at me I didn't
[16:33] actually go look in fact when they
[16:36] brought it to me in two a friend poker
[16:38] player brought to me in 2013 said Mark
[16:41] we all buy some of this I said ah it's a
[16:44] Ponzi scheme it's some some scam I'm not
[16:47] gonna bother with it you know I knew
[16:49] everything I was so smart yeah dummy
[16:54] dummy dummy dummy it's interesting for
[16:56] me when when when you see uh I think a
[16:59] lot of people in the west are actually
[17:01] like almost a little bit arrogant
[17:03] they're like oh banking system will
[17:05] continue I live in the west I live in
[17:07] whatever Austria us uh everything will
[17:09] be fine and maybe it will be maybe won't
[17:13] but you at least want to have the option
[17:15] to take your life savings like you want
[17:17] to have the option to take your
[17:18] financial energy with you I I'm also
[17:21] curious like why did you choose Thailand
[17:23] like there are a lot of different places
[17:24] and I did also a little bit research of
[17:27] like where could I go and citizens and
[17:29] stuff like that but why tent there was I
[17:32] did a ton of research and when I was
[17:35] getting ready to leave the United States
[17:36] I had 41 different countries that I
[17:39] thought were
[17:41] possibilities there was a guy on YouTube
[17:43] named Chris Parker who I had conversed
[17:46] with by email for a year and a half
[17:49] while I was selling everything because I
[17:51] had a lot of stuff tied up I had to sell
[17:54] everything you know what am I gonna do
[17:56] with 40 to guitars in my suitcase you
[17:59] know I had to sell everything so it took
[18:03] 18 months and he keep kept putting out
[18:06] videos and the people were just
[18:10] kind and
[18:12] uh they had uh at the time a totally
[18:15] territorial tax
[18:17] system and that seemed good and here's
[18:21] the thing I've got a pool right out 25
[18:24] ft from where I'm sitting it's a pool I
[18:27] can use a 36 65 days a year it's
[18:31] beautiful here all the
[18:33] time it's a little hot but that's not
[18:37] going to kill
[18:38] me um sometimes it's just gorgeous I
[18:43] mean the plants it's like Eternal spring
[18:46] here the plants are always beautiful
[18:49] blooming in different colors and you
[18:52] know it's just wonderful of a place I
[18:55] mean there's beaches everywhere if you
[18:57] want beaches you go a few hours and
[19:00] you're in the mountains you want a big
[19:02] city bangkok's one of the most visited
[19:04] cities in the world it's got 18 million
[19:07] people it's it's got twice a geographic
[19:10] area of New York City you know if you
[19:12] want a big city environment there you go
[19:15] if you want to live in the country like
[19:17] I do I live like 12 kilometers from the
[19:20] beach but if you looked outside for the
[19:23] first kilometer or two you think you
[19:25] were in the country somewhere I mean
[19:28] it's like day and night from being the
[19:32] bustling you know Patia or JN TM in
[19:35] Thailand so you get away from it all and
[19:39] you can do that on 30% of the what it
[19:42] costs to live in the United States I get
[19:44] 2 inch thick
[19:46] ribeye locally raised fed on grass
[19:50] delivered Frozen shrink wrapped in
[19:53] vacuum sealed to my door for
[19:57] $540 per pound in America that's four
[20:00] times as
[20:02] much
[20:04] $540 a pound for grass-fed ribey I mean
[20:09] so if you're
[20:11] retired and fun employed like me I came
[20:14] over here I actually had a job I was a
[20:16] cloud engineer
[20:19] managing uh big Enterprise systems in
[20:23] the
[20:24] cloud I had a job till till I became fun
[20:27] employed but if you're actually
[20:31] retired and you can
[20:33] live to a very high standard on onethird
[20:36] to price why why not give it a try if
[20:39] you like it if I don't like it I got
[20:42] suitcases I'll fill them up I'll go
[20:44] somewhere
[20:45] else but if I do I get to take my money
[20:48] with me if the world breaks out into a
[20:50] World War I get to leave I get to go to
[20:54] want to go to Van watu nobody will
[20:56] bother you down there most people
[20:59] couldn't find it on the map with a
[21:01] magnifying glass if you gave them an
[21:02] hour so figure out where you want to go
[21:05] and and have a plan that if the world
[21:07] Goes to Hell in a handbag believe me we
[21:10] got a lot of problems in this world
[21:12] we're skating on thin ice I hope nothing
[21:16] ever happens but you got things in at
[21:20] least three parts of the world that can
[21:22] explode at any particular time whoever
[21:24] they elect in Washington DC isn't going
[21:27] to make a big difference difference in
[21:29] that I mean on a scale of 1 to 10 both
[21:33] sides don't come up to one really one
[21:36] side's way better for
[21:38] crypto you know the Donald Trump is has
[21:43] has come around and he wants to make uh
[21:47] transactions in
[21:48] Bitcoin to be a non- taxable
[21:52] event just like cash and if he and that
[21:56] would greatly help
[21:58] because I still pay us
[22:01] taxes you know I'm going to have to do
[22:03] that unless I want to give up my US
[22:05] citizenship which I could do but I don't
[22:07] really I see no big advantage to do it
[22:10] I'm not going to do it just to beat a
[22:12] couple bucks of tax if there there is
[22:15] some advantages still having that US
[22:17] Passport but if it gets worse I'll
[22:20] leave you know I want freedom I want my
[22:23] money to go with me and Bitcoin is where
[22:26] you can you can store your wealth it
[22:29] ain't cash I don't buy anything with
[22:32] Bitcoin I mean I know there are people
[22:35] who says you can get a debit card and
[22:36] you can trans you know you can peel off
[22:38] a little bit for that or the other I try
[22:40] to do as little peeling off a Bitcoin in
[22:43] any taxable account I've never sold a
[22:46] single Satoshi that I had to pay tax on
[22:50] legally I try only keep it in non
[22:54] taxable accounts like Roth IRA and try
[22:58] to do it that way but as far as buying
[23:01] actual hard physical Bitcoin and holding
[23:04] in multi-sig
[23:06] storage and that's one thing I want to
[23:09] stress to your people out there do not
[23:12] make the mistake of thinking just
[23:14] because you have a multisig
[23:17] storage and you think you're you're
[23:19] smart you can put all your wealth into
[23:21] into one
[23:23] place have a few multiple Sig storage
[23:27] accounts put your put your your your uh
[23:31] Hardware Wallets on separate
[23:34] continents in safe places don't put all
[23:38] your eggs in in one address or one
[23:42] basket or or you know I had people
[23:45] saying well you could you don't need
[23:47] that many Hardware wallets if you want
[23:49] you can save a few bucks and you can
[23:51] just have multiple addresses on one
[23:53] Hardware
[23:55] wallet no you spread that stuff out and
[23:57] you keep your money safe don't put all
[24:00] them eggs in one basket no matter how
[24:02] good the basket is I mean you're not
[24:06] storing your keys in Fort Knox with the
[24:10] you know US Army at Fort Campbell Sur
[24:14] surrounding Fort Knox so protect
[24:17] yourself take a little time it's not as
[24:20] easy as having your money in a bank but
[24:22] it's a whole lot safer if you go about
[24:25] it the right way and you can have
[24:27] freedom
[24:29] you know my definition of success Robin
[24:33] has always been the same I want to do
[24:35] what I want when I want and how I want
[24:39] when I was 20 years old that was my that
[24:42] was my idea of success I want to do what
[24:46] I want when I want and how I want and to
[24:49] do that requires
[24:52] cash or Bitcoin that you convert into
[24:55] your local currency of choice Maybe I
[24:58] convert it someday into the East
[25:00] Caribbean Community
[25:02] dollar and maybe I'm living in you brace
[25:06] Virgin Islands or St kits or St Lucia or
[25:12] Dominica or
[25:14] Biz who knows where it'll be but Bitcoin
[25:17] will convert into the local currency and
[25:19] I can go out and and seek food and
[25:23] shelter whatever else I need just peel
[25:26] off enough into local currency
[25:29] that you use right away before they can
[25:31] debase it like the US Dollars doing I
[25:34] mean we've lost
[25:36] 23.6% as far as I can calculate in four
[25:40] years of buying power with the US dollar
[25:43] and and you still got people who I
[25:46] consider just stupid who say oh man I
[25:49] can get 5% interest from on no risk
[25:54] treasury you know I can lose 12% a year
[25:59] you know Michael sailor got his act
[26:01] together nobody explains it better than
[26:05] he I mean I think if anybody convinced
[26:08] me it was him I'd love to shake his hand
[26:11] one day Michael thank you you you show
[26:15] me the way 90% Bitcoin I will be
[26:19] fine I think the number goes up quicker
[26:22] and I can spend it being a sensible
[26:25] person that that's for sure and and he's
[26:28] really good like it's it's fascinating
[26:29] he's in so many interviews and he always
[26:31] finds a new way to explain explain
[26:33] Bitcoin um I want to go into the
[26:36] retirement topic with you also a little
[26:38] bit um you said you also get a lot of
[26:40] comments from like young folks 29 30 35
[26:44] maybe that look like at retirement at
[26:47] like maybe 50 55 60 65 um and they look
[26:51] for Bitcoin as a as a means to do that
[26:55] and there's always I think a lot of
[26:56] questions coming up oh how many bitco do
[26:58] I have to accumulate to retire one day
[27:01] um what will be the growth rate and I
[27:02] think you I think in one video you said
[27:05] like you expect like a five 50% growth
[27:08] rate um how do you I mean right now
[27:11] you're are 90% in Bitcoin you probably
[27:13] don't care that much how much the the
[27:15] volatil and growth goes but for those
[27:17] people who are asking for those people
[27:19] who want to plan for retirement um what
[27:21] do you say to them I say you do what you
[27:25] can and you put it on paper I just did a
[27:27] video the other day of how powerful it
[27:31] is when you write a plan down and you
[27:34] take a piece of paper and a pen and use
[27:38] your hand don't type it out you can do
[27:40] that later if you feel like it just take
[27:42] a piece of paper and a pen and write
[27:45] down your thoughts and write down your
[27:47] plan and then take a piece of tape and
[27:49] stick it up somewhere you'll look at
[27:51] every day now back in the day I had a
[27:56] guy that had this picture of a
[27:58] convertible Jaguar XK from the
[28:03] 1970s he had on his wall in his office
[28:06] and it was just his favorite car he said
[28:08] someday I'm going to own it he went out
[28:11] to buy shelves for his business and in
[28:14] the corner there was a car covered up
[28:16] and he looked underneath of it it was a
[28:17] convertible Jaguar he left the auction
[28:20] he went and borrowed money didn't tell
[28:22] his wife he bought the car and took it
[28:24] home didn't buy the
[28:26] shelves when you put it on paper and you
[28:29] put it right there in front of you
[28:31] that's what you want to do you'll make
[28:32] it happen now I don't know that there's
[28:35] a exact you know I've got people coming
[28:38] over here in Thailand who are living and
[28:41] living on
[28:43] 1,500 a month for their budget they've
[28:46] got you can get a condo here it might
[28:50] only be 30 square
[28:52] meters but it'll be a a a studio or
[28:56] one-bedroom condo and they'll live on 1,
[28:58] 1500 a month now my budget over here is
[29:00] closer to 6 or 7,000 a month but depends
[29:05] on what you want and what you think your
[29:07] budget has the type of lifestyle you
[29:10] want to live but the compounding of time
[29:15] and with Services out there like Swan
[29:18] Bitcoin that I used for years and you
[29:22] can program and you just tell them I
[29:25] want to buy X number of dollars a day or
[29:28] I want to buy X number of dollars every
[29:30] week or X number of dollars every month
[29:33] and they'll take it out of your checking
[29:35] account and they'll make the buy for you
[29:38] and when you get enough uh saved up at
[29:41] Swan they'll automatically send it to
[29:44] your Cod storage or your storage Vault
[29:47] that you can get with them wherever you
[29:49] want to do but don't don't buy $35 a day
[29:52] and try to transfer it every day and get
[29:55] small
[29:56] utxos just let build up till you get a
[29:59] you know a th000 2,000 $3,000 worth of
[30:04] and then take it to Hardware
[30:06] storage and uh so you got some
[30:11] consolidation of utxos and they'll do
[30:13] that for you for free but I tell people
[30:17] You' got time on your side you know just
[30:20] quit get out of debt quit buying cars on
[30:25] time quit buying boats on time quit
[30:28] buying you know everything that you want
[30:32] have some some time dilation to where
[30:36] you say I'm saving my money I'm not g to
[30:41] go in debt because if you're if you're
[30:43] sitting there carrying credit card debt
[30:46] and you're carrying student loan debt
[30:49] and you're carrying a car loan and
[30:52] you're doing all this stuff it's going
[30:54] to be hard for you to accumulate any
[30:56] type of wealth whether it's in Bitcoin
[30:59] or anything else okay the first thing I
[31:02] tell any young kid is get thatt free do
[31:06] without just for a while do without
[31:09] because once you do without and you get
[31:11] that free you'll be surprised how good
[31:13] you can live you have the money to buy
[31:15] it or you have the money to lease it and
[31:18] you don't have any other debts that's
[31:21] the big thing and once you get that free
[31:23] look in your life and see if there's
[31:25] some place that you're spending you know
[31:28] you're spending $203
[31:32] $40 you know a week or a day are you
[31:36] spending $10 a day at Starbucks and at
[31:40] McDonald's that you could really do
[31:43] without well then buy $50 worth of
[31:46] bitcoin a week you know that'll be $2500
[31:50] worth of bitcoin in a
[31:53] year just that it's a start and if
[31:57] Bitcoin in the next 15 or 20 years 20
[32:01] X's then that 2500 becomes I mean and
[32:06] you you keep buying it every month you
[32:08] do what you can but the first thing that
[32:12] somebody has to do if they want to
[32:13] retire well is retire without debt this
[32:18] is a debt driven Society the countries
[32:21] are in debt the states are in debt the
[32:23] cities are in debt the people are in
[32:25] debt and all you have to do get ahead in
[32:28] this life is get yourself out of goddamn
[32:32] debt debt equals
[32:35] Death it's a slow death by a Thousand
[32:38] Cuts and you won't believe how good your
[32:41] life is if you don't have people calling
[32:44] you up on the phone stunning you to make
[32:46] that next payment you're behind send you
[32:50] another payment how you ever going to
[32:52] gete there hell you better not invest in
[32:56] Bitcoin you better find some
[32:57] shitcoin 1,000 X's overnight if you want
[33:00] to get out of that get out of debt first
[33:04] or at least if you can't get out of debt
[33:07] take a little bit and put it away every
[33:10] day or every week and use a place like
[33:13] Swan to do it eventually it'll end up to
[33:16] be real
[33:17] money that's the bottom line I got out
[33:21] of debt when I was in my
[33:24] 30s and I was a fool for debt before my
[33:28] 30s you know if I saw something I wanted
[33:31] it I wanted it now you know oh
[33:34] they'll put that on payments I had good
[33:36] credit record you they'll give me
[33:39] another credit book I keep paying but
[33:41] you know there was one point in my life
[33:43] when I was real young I looked down I
[33:45] said I'm spend
[33:46] $14,000 a month on bills what the
[33:50] wrong with me I don't need four
[33:54] cars you know I got to cut back
[33:58] somewhere and and you know the first
[34:01] step towards retirement is getting out
[34:03] of debt and nobody wants to talk about
[34:07] that they all think that you know you
[34:09] have to invest and that's a sick part
[34:11] about this
[34:12] world with the debasement of Fiat
[34:15] currencies
[34:17] Robin and the buying power just going
[34:21] down every single month the buying power
[34:25] of the US dollar of the Euro I don't
[34:29] care what fiat currency it is the buying
[34:32] power is going down almost every month
[34:35] because almost every country is in debt
[34:38] and it's the debt that's dragging
[34:40] everybody down and if
[34:44] you it's a shame because you can't even
[34:47] save what you earn if you go out and you
[34:50] earn money and you save it in the fiat
[34:52] currency you can't get
[34:54] ahead you can be a doctor
[34:58] and be behind I mean it is not hard
[35:01] right now I know some people who are
[35:03] medical professionals who spent eight
[35:06] years in
[35:07] school and they're struggling
[35:11] financially I mean they are
[35:14] doctors and they're struggling
[35:16] financially you know why because they're
[35:18] in debt they got a beautiful car they
[35:21] got beautiful house they got probably
[35:24] got a nice boat they take nice vacations
[35:26] they put it on the credit card but went
[35:29] right down to it they're
[35:32] struggling because they're living above
[35:34] their means just like the countries are
[35:37] just like the the school districts are
[35:39] just like the cities are and that's all
[35:42] around the world everybody wants to live
[35:44] above their means if they just lived
[35:46] within their means for a while and
[35:48] invested for a while they could get to a
[35:52] point where they could live a much nicer
[35:55] life and not be in debt
[35:58] I mean that's everybody wants to look at
[36:00] Bitcoin as a magic answer and it might
[36:02] be if a you know if I was the United
[36:05] States government I got old pal up there
[36:08] on the printing press able to print Fiat
[36:11] I'd say print me off $250 billion I'm
[36:15] gonna go buy us some
[36:16] Bitcoin and that stuff's number goingon
[36:19] to go up the first country that comes in
[36:22] and does it it's going to be a genius I
[36:24] mean a real country I love Al Salvador
[36:27] think they've done a wonderful job I
[36:29] think that President down there deserves
[36:31] a pat on the back but let's face it he's
[36:35] a El Salvador is a little bitty teeny
[36:38] teeny country with a budget that the
[36:41] United States goes in debt that much
[36:43] money by the time we get off this call
[36:45] today they've already blown that much
[36:47] money during the call I mean that's
[36:50] their whole the whole GDP annual GDP of
[36:54] El Salvador you United States stes goes
[36:58] in debt every day that much money I mean
[37:02] the first real country
[37:05] Russia China the US
[37:09] England something with Japan something
[37:12] with the GDP that can print their own
[37:15] Fiat first one that buys themselves a
[37:19] boatload of Bitcoin will make a dent in
[37:22] their own debt I mean if I could print
[37:25] the money I'd be buying every day
[37:29] buying the dips I'm buying period I
[37:32] don't care what the price is let me
[37:35] print the money and let me buy it how
[37:38] can the governments be so damn dumb they
[37:41] get to print it I don't want anybody's
[37:45] currency that that they can print at
[37:48] will for
[37:50] free it has no value I mean the fact
[37:53] that they could print it for free and go
[37:55] buy Bitcoin
[37:57] how stupid do they have to be not to
[38:00] take that deal if you watch or listen to
[38:02] my podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[38:04] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[38:07] the most important step is to keep the
[38:10] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[38:13] wallet my personal recommendation for
[38:15] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super

[39:16] and last but not least I have something
[39:18] completely new for you guys I partnered
[39:21] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[39:25] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[39:28] saw created by anyone look at that
[39:30] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[39:33] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[39:36] perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[39:39] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[39:42] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[39:45] make sure to check out the link in the
[39:47] description for this amazing coin
[39:49] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[39:52] amazing I love them so much it was
[39:54] really hard for me to pick the one that
[39:56] I want to have because there are a lot
[39:58] of great options I went with the new
[40:01] transparency Edition they're all limited
[40:04] so grab yours those will not be
[40:06] available for a long time but there will
[40:08] come new models and new amazing designs
[40:11] along the way it's it's it's so
[40:13] fascinating because um when you see at
[40:16] nation state level I mean you have the
[40:17] US elections coming up uh we have the
[40:20] nationville conference where so many
[40:22] politicians talked and it seems like us
[40:25] is moving more and more uh in in favor
[40:27] of crypto and Bitcoin um where do you
[40:30] see like if you have to bet like what
[40:33] major count will be the the first mover
[40:36] eventually I think if Trump gets elected
[40:39] the one thing the one thing I will say
[40:43] about Trump was for the most part he did
[40:47] everything he said he was G to do during
[40:48] his first term he tried anyway if he
[40:52] said he was going to do it he tried to
[40:54] do it if he got blocked by you know some
[40:58] court
[41:00] or somebody sued him to stop him or
[41:03] whatever he tried and if he says he's
[41:05] going to create a national uh strategic
[41:08] reserve for Bitcoin I believe he will
[41:11] now he wasn't strong enough I think he
[41:14] really needs to come out and say we need
[41:16] to buy Bitcoin we need to buy it now
[41:19] okay so we're just gonna we're not going
[41:22] to buy a small amount we're gonna we're
[41:24] gonna leg in and we're g to get there
[41:27] we're g to we're going to buy it we're
[41:29] going to do Michael sailor style you
[41:32] know let's buy a billion a day for the
[41:34] next 250 days get it over
[41:38] with okay in five years they're going to
[41:41] be real happy with that investment in 10
[41:44] years they're going to be even more
[41:45] happy with that investment and the fear
[41:48] of missing out by there's only going to
[41:50] be
[41:51] room for two
[41:54] significant sovereign states
[41:58] to get into Bitcoin I don't think you're
[42:01] going to get more than two 20%
[42:06] holders and if they do get to
[42:09] 20% they're going to spend dearly to get
[42:13] there because there's just not that kind
[42:16] of
[42:17] Supply but it makes a whole lot of
[42:21] sense but yeah it doesn't matter what
[42:24] the US does
[42:27] if they don't do the same thing that I
[42:30] just caution these young people to do
[42:32] and get out of debt if they continue you
[42:35] look I don't want them to cut Social
[42:38] Security I get Social Security I paid
[42:40] into it for 40
[42:42] years I get Social Security you pay into
[42:46] that that's not a gift that's not a give
[42:49] out they take money out of your check in
[42:51] the United States every single check you
[42:54] get for Social Security but if they have
[42:57] to cut entitlements including Social
[43:00] Security Medicare and whatever they have
[43:03] to do the the government's got to do it
[43:06] the government's got to get themselves
[43:08] into a balanced budget that's actually
[43:11] collecting more from its citizens and it
[43:14] spends but it can't just go collect more
[43:16] for Citizens it's got to stop spending
[43:19] it's got to C curtail what it's spending
[43:24] because they're already taxing everybody
[43:27] to death and and that's a fact so if
[43:31] they don't do that there's no hope
[43:34] sooner or later the cards will collapse
[43:37] and they need to get rid of the they
[43:39] need to get rid of the Federal
[43:41] Reserve for try and mon modern monetary
[43:45] policy mmt doesn't work the Federal
[43:48] Reserve is there to be the buyer of Last
[43:51] Resort of government debt their main job
[43:55] that at 2%
[43:57] 2% so they can rob you and keep them
[44:00] full full employment being their other
[44:03] mandate is so that they can keep full
[44:05] employment from people that they can rob
[44:07] them of their
[44:09] money it's all based on that the only
[44:12] thing they do do of value is they create
[44:16] the illusion that people are buying US
[44:20] debt when the treasury offers us
[44:23] treasury debt and nobody steps in and
[44:26] takes the bid the Federal Reserve comes
[44:29] in and they buy it and put it on their
[44:31] balance sheet to give the illusion that
[44:35] the bond Market's fully
[44:38] functional they are the buyers of Last
[44:40] Resort in
[44:42] 2008 the FED had about $800 billion
[44:47] balance sheet it went up to 9 trillion
[44:51] balance sheet now it's down around $7
[44:54] trillion without the the US government
[44:59] overspending people say the US economy
[45:02] is growing the GDP is
[45:05] growing how much of the GDP is
[45:09] government
[45:10] spending the government is spending
[45:13] money it don't have money it's borrowing
[45:16] from
[45:17] other uh countries and other
[45:21] investors and then they include that in
[45:23] the GDP if the government didn't
[45:25] overspend more than they had the GDP
[45:28] would not be growing it would probably
[45:31] be in a recession as Booth says
[45:35] everything's
[45:37] deflationary they're propping that up
[45:39] through overspending and if they don't
[45:41] stop that London Bridge will come
[45:44] down somebody will pull out that last
[45:46] stick in the D janga pile and it's going
[45:48] to all end up on the
[45:50] floor sooner or later and that's why my
[45:53] money's in Bitcoin because when it does
[45:55] I'm going to lose 10% of what I own at
[45:59] best worst case
[46:01] scenario and probably only half of that
[46:03] because I got probably got half of of
[46:06] that money in in Thai Banks instead of
[46:10] US Banks so hopefully only the US
[46:13] collapse and I can get the money out of
[46:15] the tie bank quick enough to before I
[46:17] lose it all you know and but it's going
[46:21] to come down something's going to happen
[46:24] probably a war because War corrects all
[46:26] all deficits I mean it it does that's
[46:30] that's how they juice up the
[46:33] economy they've done it they did in
[46:36] World War I there's no coincidence that
[46:38] World War I happened right after Federal
[46:41] Reserve was created in in 1913 you think
[46:44] about JP Morgan was financing both sides
[46:47] of World War I it's all about the
[46:49] bankers that always has been you can't
[46:52] trust
[46:53] them thank you Satoshi thank you thank
[46:57] you thank you people are going to take a
[46:59] bath do you think we could uh I mean
[47:03] that's like far in the future but if
[47:04] like in 50 years or later than that live
[47:08] on kind of a Bitcoin standard where
[47:10] Bitcoin is our M of exchange and unit of
[47:13] account do you think that Wars will be
[47:16] eliminated or maybe uh limited well let
[47:21] me put it this way if you couldn't
[47:23] Finance for war you couldn't have the
[47:26] war
[47:28] in in World War
[47:30] I it was a major work for the United
[47:33] States government to get their people to
[47:36] go to work to build the bombers and then
[47:38] take their salary and buy war bonds with
[47:40] it they literally had people going to
[47:43] the factories and working and then
[47:46] counting them out of their money that
[47:48] they paid them to build the bombers to
[47:50] buy war bonds to put back into the war
[47:53] effort okay you have to get the the
[47:57] population to agree to it and if if you
[48:00] make them agree to funding a war out of
[48:03] their own pocket it's it has to be a a
[48:07] cause a righteous cause that they
[48:09] totally believe in you're not going to
[48:11] get all these funding through debt like
[48:15] they did they came off the gold standard
[48:19] because of the Vietnam War the Vietnam
[48:22] War sold no war
[48:24] bonds the Vietnam War was ran in debt
[48:29] and then they decide and then the other
[48:31] countries came for their gold and Nixon
[48:33] took us off the gold stand think about
[48:35] this Robin no fiat currency in the world
[48:39] today was created as a fiat currency it
[48:42] wasn't backed by gold or
[48:45] silver none not a single one they all
[48:48] started off on the gold standard or at
[48:52] minimum a silver
[48:54] standard and then they took away being
[48:58] backed by
[48:59] gold in fact we had the same sort of
[49:04] problem in 1913 most of the countries
[49:07] came off the gold standard until we got
[49:10] back on the gold standard after World
[49:12] War I only I I think Sweden was the only
[49:16] country that stayed on the gold standard
[49:18] until
[49:20] 1934 or was it Switzerland one of those
[49:22] two
[49:24] Switzerland I I get those two countries
[49:26] confused in my mind but Switzerland
[49:28] stayed in 1934 almost all the other
[49:31] major countries came off the gold stand
[49:33] in 1913 happened to be right around the
[49:36] time the Federal Reserve was
[49:39] created no fiat currency could ever be
[49:44] created without the backing of gold
[49:47] originally or the backing of of a
[49:50] precious metal or backing of some uh
[49:53] physical commodity that gave it worth to
[49:56] the public but now nothing has any worth
[50:00] and there's no limit on the borrowing
[50:03] and they keep paying you know when the
[50:05] numbers get this big I ran like seven
[50:08] businesses over my life when the numbers
[50:11] get big enough you can always borrow
[50:13] from Peter to pay Paul and then you
[50:16] borrow from Mary to pay Peter and then
[50:19] you borrow from John to pay Mary and
[50:21] then borrow from Mary again to pay
[50:24] Peter when the numbers are big enough
[50:27] you can juggle and keep them plates in
[50:29] the air for a very very long time and
[50:32] the US government and all this debt that
[50:34] they have if they did it for another 40
[50:37] years it wouldn't surprise me none
[50:40] because the numbers are just so
[50:42] large that you know if it collaps
[50:46] tomorrow it wouldn't surprise me
[50:48] any I would I wouldn't be surprised
[50:52] either way but sooner or later it's
[50:55] unsustainable so if you don't have your
[50:58] money in assets that you can
[51:02] control and and for the people like
[51:04] Grant incard or Grant Cardone who's got
[51:07] all the
[51:09] property well when the banks all
[51:11] collapse in the United States what
[51:12] Good's all that property in the United
[51:14] States going to be what good nobody's
[51:17] going to be able to pay the
[51:19] rent landlords aren't going to be able
[51:21] to pay the mortgage if the banks
[51:23] collapse even the government ain't
[51:25] bailing people out what they should have
[51:27] did in 2008 during the great financial
[51:30] crisis they should have let some of them
[51:32] Banks fail oh it would have been
[51:34] brutally bloody people would have took a
[51:37] bath people would have been suffering
[51:40] but there's no suffering Bankers never
[51:42] lose you cannot have a fair Society
[51:46] where there is never anybody in of
[51:50] importantance whoever loses they take
[51:52] wild
[51:54] chances they play with derivatives
[51:57] they con everybody into buying them and
[52:00] when the whole thing goes tits
[52:02] up nobody's held responsible and only
[52:06] Leman Brothers
[52:08] failed they bail out Marl Lynch who by
[52:12] the way at that time had
[52:15] 49.8% of Black Rock
[52:18] stock so they owned
[52:20] 49.8% of Black Rock and Bank of America
[52:24] bought them out
[52:26] because of the Black Rock stock so they
[52:29] should have let Merl Lynch fail they
[52:32] should have let Leeman Brothers fail and
[52:35] anybody else they took the house of cars
[52:37] down with them and we wouldn't be in
[52:39] this situation we're in now every once
[52:42] in a while somebody has to go bankrupt
[52:44] and pay the piper Piper for bad policy
[52:48] nobody's ever willing to do
[52:51] that nobody's ever willing to let
[52:54] something hit rock bottom if you got
[52:56] somebody who's addicted to drugs and you
[52:59] just keep giving them all the drugs that
[53:01] they
[53:02] want they will never get off
[53:05] drugs you have to let them have
[53:08] withdrawal symptoms you have to let them
[53:11] crash you have to let them sit with
[53:13] their head over the toilet for once in a
[53:15] while and let the world pay that pain
[53:19] that that is due and until that happens
[53:23] Robin you better have your money in
[53:25] Bitcoin because the people who
[53:29] do are going to be like fat cats after
[53:32] the 1929 crash who had all their money
[53:36] at the time buried in their
[53:39] mattress you know if you had all your
[53:41] money buried in your mattress in 1929
[53:43] when the stock market crashed in the
[53:45] United States you were a wealthy
[53:48] individual bitcoin's like the mattress I
[53:52] love that a lot you have really good uh
[53:55] comparisons um one last thing I want to
[53:57] get into with you is um you mentioned it
[53:59] a little bit with real estate I noticed
[54:01] that you said you you rent and it's
[54:04] really interesting because when you look
[54:05] at real estate prices they all went up
[54:08] through the roof but when you measure
[54:09] the same real estate prices uh in
[54:12] Bitcoin for example the average us home
[54:14] was 32 Bitcoin five years ago now it's
[54:17] like six Bitcoin uh and I had last time
[54:20] an interview with Peter dunworth he said
[54:22] like oh um how how's in in a Million
[54:27] a house in um 20 years you probably can
[54:29] buy for a million Sates if the world
[54:32] goes crazy maybe even 100,000 Sates the
[54:35] uh average home price um why do you um
[54:39] rent and not buy and did you while you
[54:41] were searching for assets also consider
[54:44] other um Investments like real estate
[54:46] ETFs gold and stuff like that and why
[54:48] did you then uh uh go with Bitcoin and
[54:52] go with renting and not buying real
[54:55] estate in Thailand
[54:57] well first off in Thailand running real
[54:59] estate is a bad in a bad business for
[55:02] the people who own the real estate the
[55:04] average return on pie of real estate in
[55:06] Thailand is about 5% a year whereas in
[55:09] the United States it might be 12% a year
[55:12] well how are you going to come out ahead
[55:14] with a
[55:15] 5% return on investment now if you think
[55:19] about it I first came to
[55:23] this uh pool Villa and the the rent was
[55:27] like $1900 a month so I did that in
[55:32] November of
[55:34] 2023 where was the price of Bitcoin in
[55:38] 2023 in November
[55:41] 30,000 or less I don't know I I'd be
[55:45] guessing but now it's looking like it's
[55:49] 63,9
[55:51] 165 so let's say it
[55:54] tripled okay if I would have took and
[55:57] bought this condo I could have left the
[55:59] money in
[56:00] there and tripled
[56:03] it and by the way this condo here is
[56:07] gorgeous and the one I'm moving into NE
[56:10] in next November here coming up I
[56:12] already got set up it's a 3 thou 300
[56:17] square meters
[56:19] three-bedroom threein sweet
[56:22] bass absolutely gorgeous very modern
[56:25] brand spanking new solar power on the
[56:28] roof never been lived in the pool was is
[56:31] 45 ft long and 20 foot wide absolutely
[56:37] gorgeous place and it was built for
[56:41] $400,000 that's how much they spent to
[56:44] build it now if you can double that
[56:48] $400,000 and only pay
[56:51] $2,000 a month
[56:53] rent in a year what do you want would
[56:57] you rather you know end up with
[57:01] 275,000 in profit on your
[57:04] $400,000 that you own the house or would
[57:07] you
[57:08] rather spend the $400,000 and not have
[57:12] to pay the
[57:13] 25,000 you're just way
[57:15] ahead by
[57:17] renting and uh just do the math I mean
[57:22] even through the down years there's been
[57:25] there's no asset that pays a higher
[57:28] return a higher keger for the last 15
[57:32] years even the last five years nasdaq's
[57:35] not even close and NASDAQ will only keep
[57:38] your head just barely above the the cost
[57:42] of
[57:44] of inflation plus the cost of debasement
[57:47] of the US currency
[57:50] so here it makes sense to just rent now
[57:54] this house right here and the new house
[57:56] would be about7 or $8,000 a month in
[57:59] Florida and I know this well it it would
[58:02] be S or 8,000 bucks a month not 2,000
[58:06] but you don't you know and and the 2,000
[58:09] rent that includes insurance I don't
[58:12] have to pay it includes your homeowners
[58:14] fees or whatever they call them here and
[58:18] even if you bought it to rent it out who
[58:20] wants a 5% return you can do that just
[58:24] put it in US treasuries you you can lose
[58:26] money there just as easily with less
[58:29] headache so I say rent and and as I get
[58:34] older maybe I get to a point you know
[58:37] two or three years down line where this
[58:39] place is too big maybe I just want a
[58:42] condo maybe I don't want the pool
[58:44] anymore maybe I just assum do something
[58:47] else leave do what you want when you
[58:50] want and how you want then you'll be a
[58:52] success in life that's my only goal for
[58:55] my my goal for Success was never how
[58:57] many zeros I could stack up in a bank
[59:00] account it was how happy can I be doing
[59:04] what I want when I want and how I want
[59:07] and not having the ties any more than a
[59:11] lease you know for $4,000 I could break
[59:14] a lease at any
[59:17] time just you know if I really wanted to
[59:19] go to
[59:20] Philippines cost me 4,000 to break a
[59:23] lease no big deal small change if you
[59:27] own the house you go to the Philippines
[59:29] what are you going to do you got to get
[59:30] the house ready to sell you got to find
[59:32] a real estate agent you got to find a
[59:33] buyer you got to go through all the
[59:35] hassle of trying to you know sell a
[59:38] house that cost you money to start with
[59:41] people got start thinking
[59:43] about uh I can't stand the world
[59:46] economic Forum but when he said you own
[59:49] nothing and be
[59:51] happy well that can be a choice
[59:55] too I mean people look at that you own
[59:58] nothing and be happy from the world
[60:01] economic Forum as if it's some form of
[60:03] evil and and the way they say it it
[60:05] might
[60:06] be
[60:08] but I truly can own very little and be
[60:13] happy I don't have to own proper I've
[60:16] owned property when I was in my 20s I
[60:19] had over 20000 rental
[60:21] units and I hated being a landlord I had
[60:25] multi I had multiple single family homes
[60:28] I rented out I hated being a
[60:31] landlord you
[60:33] know uh the only reason I didn't get to
[60:36] Thailand quicker was I had to get rid of
[60:39] property to start with I don't want no
[60:41] more property so I want to be
[60:44] unencumbered that's the reason I don't
[60:47] think it's a good investment especially
[60:49] here in Thailand especially the freedom
[60:51] aspect is is a big one um could be an
[60:53] interesting question for you um what's
[60:55] your definition are you brought before
[60:57] the the definition of success what is
[61:00] your definition of uh Freedom my
[61:02] definition of freedom and success are
[61:05] the same exact thing because if you can
[61:08] do what you want when you want and how
[61:10] you want to do it you're a free I wish I
[61:13] could I wish we would get to a point in
[61:16] this world where we would dial it back a
[61:19] bit and get back freedom of thought and
[61:22] critical thinking you know that the educ
[61:26] ation system United States was created
[61:29] by uh George D Rockefeller in 1902 he
[61:34] started the uh general
[61:37] education uh GDC what was the
[61:41] C4 well he funded it with with over a
[61:45] period from like 1902 through
[61:48] 1950s and his whole thing was to educate
[61:52] the people just smart enough so they
[61:55] would become obedient workers at the
[61:58] time we didn't have in the United States
[62:01] the uh law to send all the kids to
[62:03] school he wanted them to get up early
[62:06] come to school every day at the same
[62:08] time so they would become good Factory
[62:10] workers good workers for business they
[62:13] didn't want to teach them they didn't
[62:15] want them to be critical thinkers they
[62:17] didn't want them to be entrepreneurs
[62:19] johy Rockefeller later got Carnegie to
[62:22] go in and continue to fund this so he
[62:26] could put together an education system
[62:28] of dumbing down the people of the United
[62:30] States they didn't want to create
[62:32] scientists they wanted to create workers
[62:36] they wanted people obedient who were
[62:37] used to getting up doing what they were
[62:40] told five days a week and they got
[62:42] passed through Congress by creating this
[62:45] Foundation that they
[62:47] funded and maybe we'll get to a point in
[62:50] this world where freedom of speech is is
[62:53] a new right yeah know countries like
[62:58] Hungary where freedom of speech means
[63:00] something Poland where where right of
[63:03] sovereignty and to keep immigrants from
[63:06] illegally entering the country mean
[63:09] something maybe the world will get off
[63:11] this new world order of
[63:15] totalitarianism and socialism and
[63:18] Marxism and will come back towards the
[63:20] center and we'll have some constructive
[63:23] conversations and we won't hate
[63:26] everybody I left the United States
[63:29] because half the country hates the other
[63:31] half it's got so bad it's like well if
[63:35] they if they vote if he's in favor of
[63:37] trump I don't want him dating my
[63:39] daughter if she if she doesn't like
[63:42] Trump I don't want my son dating
[63:44] her I mean come
[63:47] on have a conversation about it talk
[63:51] about it listen God gave me two ears God
[63:56] gave you two ears and by the way I want
[63:58] to compliment you you are an excellent
[64:00] host cuz you let me rant on and you keep
[64:04] your mouth shut and you listen and you
[64:06] don't interject every five minutes you
[64:09] you're just a wonderful host that way if
[64:12] I could be half as good host as I am a
[64:14] talker but I'm hoping that the world
[64:17] will change I only do my YouTube channel
[64:21] because I want to spread Good Karma it's
[64:23] my wish that more people you know if if
[64:26] I ever got word that some guy said yeah
[64:30] I heard that Rand of yours and three
[64:32] years ago I started doing everything I
[64:36] could I wrote a plan down on paper I
[64:38] stuck it up on the wall that I was going
[64:39] to get out of debt and I can tell you
[64:41] right now I am debt free or I am debt
[64:46] free except for the mortgage on my house
[64:48] I've got a wife and two kids we already
[64:51] have the house we use the house it's
[64:54] utilitarianism and you know that's the
[64:56] way you buy a house in the United States
[64:58] is with a mortgage which I'm not totally
[65:00] against if that's what you want to do
[65:02] with your house I mean it it's totar
[65:07] it's totally okay if that's way you want
[65:10] to do raising a family but if I ever you
[65:13] know help somebody to get out of debt
[65:16] because you
[65:18] cannot get out of a hole unless you stop
[65:22] digging if you're in the hole now stop
[65:26] digging once you stop digging then you
[65:28] can start working on steps to get out of
[65:30] the hole and get yourself some wealth so
[65:34] later in life you can live like me I'm
[65:37] living like a king over here I'm 69
[65:40] years old and I'm fortunate enough to
[65:42] have a girlfriend that's 27 years
[65:44] younger than me and makes me laugh every
[65:46] day how can you do better than that in
[65:48] life I laugh I laugh so hard around
[65:52] here and and you know I'm doing great
[65:55] and I'm not even cute so you know think
[65:59] how good you could do robin you could be
[66:00] over here lining them up around the
[66:02] block having a good
[66:07] time really
[66:09] cool Mar I really enjoy our conversation
[66:12] it's it's really a pleasure you're an
[66:14] amazing uh guest so so like a compliment
[66:17] back to you um we have an end routine in
[66:21] the podcast with two questions the one
[66:23] question is always the same for every
[66:24] guest uh and the question is always the
[66:27] same is what can we learn from you
[66:30] besides all the things that we already
[66:32] talked about in the podcast I've got an
[66:34] excellent series on how to die broke I'm
[66:36] a commercially rated pilot and when they
[66:39] taught me how to fly gliders they said
[66:42] the secret to Flying the glider is we
[66:44] tow you up really high in the air a
[66:46] couple miles and we let you loose the
[66:48] secret to Flying gliders is you want to
[66:50] run out of altitude and air speed at the
[66:54] same time you're over a run way that's
[66:57] the whole secret to Flying the glider
[66:59] because you got no motor you got to run
[67:01] out of altitude and air speed while
[67:04] you're over the
[67:05] runway well in life I'm trying to die
[67:09] broke
[67:11] because if you run out of
[67:14] money and oxygen at the same time you're
[67:18] over a soft place to
[67:21] land you'll be a real happy camper cuz
[67:25] it isn't the one who dies with the most
[67:27] toys wins it's the guy who dies with the
[67:31] most memories and the most
[67:33] laughs and the best
[67:36] time and if he doesn't have a single
[67:40] Satoshi left to his name and he dies
[67:44] right on the spot he did it
[67:47] right create memories create experiences
[67:50] create Joy smile at somebody who needs
[67:54] to be smiled at
[67:56] my girlfriend's grandmother came here
[68:00] two days ago she's 80 years old looks
[68:04] like she's a
[68:06] hundred has never seen the ocean
[68:10] before now I ended up paying for 10 of
[68:13] her family members to come down
[68:16] here and at least five of them have
[68:19] never seen the ocean and they went to
[68:22] the ocean and they sat on the chairs
[68:24] under the um um and they went out in the
[68:26] ocean and they waited in the waves and
[68:29] that brought joy to my heart cost money
[68:32] but it brought joy in my heart so if if
[68:35] you want to do something in life die
[68:38] broke I've got a series of it on my
[68:41] YouTube channel and uh I think that
[68:45] that's the best thing you can do in life
[68:47] because if you die with a lot of toys
[68:49] and a lot of money that you didn't spend
[68:52] and you didn't have fun sh on you
[68:54] nothing so much really cool um Mark now
[68:58] we have an tinam uh which will introduce
[69:00] a completely different topic again um
[69:03] where the previous guest is asking a
[69:05] question uh for the next guest without
[69:07] knowing who the next guest actually is
[69:08] so the previous guest had a question for
[69:10] you without knowing actually who you are
[69:13] and he has an interesting two-part
[69:16] question the first is uh um what is your
[69:19] strongest belief that you currently have
[69:21] in the US politics and then the second
[69:24] part of the question is is Can you steal
[69:26] man this opinion so like can you make an
[69:30] argument against your own uh belief wow
[69:33] good question okay my strongest belief
[69:38] about us politics is I know for a fact
[69:41] that both sides will do anything to
[69:45] win regardless of
[69:49] honesty both sides now I would say that
[69:53] some sides are better
[69:56] at cheating and I learned this really
[69:58] early because of my wife that I was with
[70:00] for 35 years she was really big with the
[70:04] Democrats and she was a national
[70:07] Democratic uh convention delegate she
[70:10] went to the National Convention in 1988
[70:13] she was really big in in the Democratic
[70:16] side too uh John F Kandy Junior came to
[70:20] town and he borrowed our cars to drive
[70:23] around town in so when she went down
[70:26] there she was tuned in I mean she
[70:29] donated to him she donated time she
[70:32] donated I had 100 office phones 100
[70:35] phone lines so late at night people
[70:38] could come in and do telephone calling
[70:40] trying to drum up votes now I wasn't
[70:42] Democratic but she was so she went down
[70:45] there and she they first thing they told
[70:48] her was how she was going to vote she
[70:50] said well let's talk about this let's
[70:52] discuss this and let's take a vote on
[70:54] what our state wants to vote on they
[70:57] said no you're going to vote Yes on this
[71:01] and no on that and yes on this and no on
[71:03] that she says that's not the way it
[71:04] works we come down here to discuss our
[71:07] party and the direction we want our
[71:09] country to go in they said no you came
[71:11] down here to sit in the seat and clap
[71:13] when we tell you to clap if you don't
[71:15] like it just get the hell out we'll put
[71:18] an alternate in your chair and she did
[71:20] she left came back crying and she never
[71:23] ever gave him another dime she said some
[71:25] most corrupt thing she ever seen in her
[71:27] life this was in 1988 when dakus was
[71:30] running for the Democratic party and the
[71:33] Republican parties know better so my
[71:36] wish would be that we we got back to
[71:41] where honesty meant something in the
[71:43] United States and where people couldn't
[71:46] look at the camera and
[71:49] downright tell the exact opposite of
[71:52] what they know to be true because it
[71:55] benefits their
[71:57] party what was the second part of your
[71:59] question now the second part of your qu
[72:02] of the question is um since this is your
[72:05] biggest belief um what would be the
[72:07] argument against that like Can you steal
[72:09] man uh this
[72:11] opinion well this opinion could be
[72:14] steamrolled to the fact that they're
[72:17] lying through their teeth is only my
[72:21] opinion of
[72:22] it the fact that they're telling what I
[72:26] consider a lie is because I'm delusional
[72:30] not them you know the the fact that you
[72:33] know they can look you square in the eye
[72:36] and tell you
[72:38] that
[72:39] that these demonstrations are peaceful
[72:42] while standing in front of a burning
[72:44] police station in the background of the
[72:47] camera shot and say uh these
[72:50] demonstrations here in Milwaukee are
[72:52] mostly peaceful and Flames are coming
[72:54] out the police station where they threw
[72:56] Molotov cocktails in uh this mostly
[73:00] peaceful but they're telling this on
[73:01] national TV then I must be delusional so
[73:05] I think that asking for an honest
[73:09] politician may never ever happen as long
[73:12] as
[73:13] we as long as we have an adversarial
[73:17] system of government with
[73:19] parties you know uh and secondly I don't
[73:23] think most of of our politicians are
[73:26] very well educated you know when you had
[73:29] people who spoke seven languages who
[73:32] founded the United States back in the
[73:34] 1700s these were educated individuals
[73:38] thoughtful
[73:39] individuals and
[73:41] now you have to have a pulse and be a
[73:45] good liar to get elected in the United
[73:47] States and that's all you need you got
[73:49] those two qualities you might be
[73:53] president only you need is a pulse and
[73:55] be a good liar baby so I don't think
[73:58] anything's everever going to happen to
[73:59] improve it and that's why I believe in
[74:02] the Bitcoin standard that you've got as
[74:05] long as you invest in a a few suitcases
[74:09] and have your life on bitcoin standard
[74:12] so you can get money wherever you are in
[74:14] the world converted to the local fiat
[74:17] currency so you can live then I think
[74:20] you're free and and that's the way it
[74:22] goes but I don't think it's going to
[74:24] happen that can get away from liars and
[74:27] I think that's the the biggest message
[74:28] like get get Bitcoin in case something
[74:31] happens because them there might
[74:34] actually something happening um really
[74:36] cool thank you Mark for for being on the
