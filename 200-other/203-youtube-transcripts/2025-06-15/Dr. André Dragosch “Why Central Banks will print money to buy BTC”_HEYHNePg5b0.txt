[00:00] the black rocks and fidelities actually
[00:02] validated the investment case for
[00:05] Pension funds and these guys they may
[00:07] validate it for like Sovereign wealth
[00:09] funds as a result these guys The
[00:11] Sovereign wealth funds they start
[00:13] validating it for central bank there's
[00:15] been huge price appreciations post
[00:17] Haring on average 17x 500 days after the
[00:20] Haring and that's the time lag of this
[00:22] effect which takes hold around 100 days
[00:25] after Haring and then becomes
[00:26] increasingly significant and so 100 days
[00:28] after the Haring would imply so we had
[00:31] the Haring event on the 20th of April
[00:33] this would imply that it will become
[00:35] significant around August Banks create
[00:38] money out of the N every time a
[00:40] Commercial Bank lends money it creates
[00:43] money the marginal cost of production in
[00:45] order to produce a single euro is the
[00:47] same for like 1 billion Euro it used to
[00:50] be a career risk to invest into Bitcoin
[00:53] but at some point this will change so it
[00:55] will be a career risk not to invest
[00:58] since trading launch us SP Bitcoin ETFs
[01:00] alone we saw around 14.5 billion almost
[01:04] 15 billion in net flows only it blew out
[01:07] expectations you haven't probably even
[01:09] seen half of potential inflows and it's
[01:12] not like adoption drives price it's the
[01:15] other way around price drives
[01:20] adoption let's start with the basics
[01:23] like what is market liquidity for those
[01:25] who don't know I think uh Market
[01:26] liquidity and sometimes also referred to
[01:29] as macro liquidity yeah it's it's right
[01:33] I mean many people understand many
[01:35] different things
[01:37] right and when you speak about macro
[01:40] liquidity for instance I think most
[01:43] people understand money supply growth
[01:47] right of course you have different
[01:49] definitions of money supply growth right
[01:51] you have maybe Central Bank base money
[01:54] money growth Central Bank Reserves you
[01:57] have M1 M2 and so on you have credit
[02:00] growth which some people also understand
[02:03] as like uh money supply growth in
[02:07] general but I think what most people
[02:10] tend to look at in terms of liquidity
[02:13] growth are Central Bank Reserves and
[02:17] sometimes also M2 money supply growth
[02:19] but I think that's like the liquid
[02:22] component of money supply that most
[02:24] people pay attention
[02:25] to and um so as far as money growth is
[02:31] concerned there was like in April uh the
[02:34] M2 money supply Mont aggregate in the US
[02:37] turned positive for the first time since
[02:40] I think mid 2022 and it has been
[02:44] contracting since mid 2022 it has been
[02:46] contracting for almost two years right
[02:50] and as far as I know it's been the
[02:53] longest contraction in money supply SL
[02:57] liquidity um since the
[03:01] 1930s and I think it's it's it's totally
[03:03] consistent with the fact
[03:06] that um we have an inent inverted yield
[03:09] curve right the term structure of
[03:11] interest rates in US Treasury markets
[03:14] has not been upward sloping but has been
[03:17] like inverted so the longer end of the
[03:21] yield curve has been lower the yield has
[03:24] been lower than the short end of the
[03:26] curve because of monry tightening by the
[03:28] Fed and this totally consistent because
[03:31] you can see in history that periods of
[03:36] money supply contraction like tight
[03:39] monetary policy money supply contraction
[03:41] and so on quantitative tightening
[03:44] they're usually associated with periods
[03:47] of an inverted or very shallow yield
[03:50] curve and yes yeah please it's
[03:55] interesting for me because um I always
[03:58] look at M2 like
[04:00] when I look at money supply when I look
[04:02] at uh like there's this this term like
[04:05] all the the FED reserves and central
[04:07] banks are always printing money but like
[04:09] printing money is not literally printing
[04:11] money they are always doing something
[04:14] like this is not literally like oh just
[04:16] create money out of th air um there
[04:18] there are different me methods do that
[04:21] um but for me always like M2 was kind of
[04:24] the the best way to to track the the
[04:27] money supply uh what was the other thing
[04:29] that that you
[04:30] mentioned Central Bank Reserves I think
[04:33] there's a big difference between those
[04:36] two types of
[04:37] monies so as you mentioned so Banks
[04:40] create money out of th air it's it's
[04:43] academic truth it's been shown it's been
[04:45] demonstrated in Academia as
[04:48] well and um it's not only the central
[04:52] bank that creates money it's like
[04:53] commercial Banks as well and I I think
[04:56] the majority vast majority of money
[04:58] supply originates not from the Central
[05:02] Banking sector but from the Commercial
[05:03] Banking
[05:04] sector every time a Commercial
[05:08] Bank um lends money gives out a loan it
[05:13] creates money by a balance sheet
[05:15] expansion so the active and the passive
[05:18] side are expended in the banies and
[05:21] that's how they create
[05:23] money and uh similar for the FED they
[05:27] buy assets right but at the same time
[05:30] for instance they buy like treasury
[05:32] bonds or mortgage back Securities on the
[05:34] asset side but at the same time they
[05:38] credit commercial Banks reserves right
[05:41] with central bank money so reserves go
[05:43] up which is a liability for the central
[05:45] bank and assets go up at the same time
[05:48] so their balance sheet
[05:50] expanded they increased the uh base
[05:53] money
[05:54] supply but it they created it out out of
[05:57] nothing digitally right
[06:00] and we can talk about like uh I mean
[06:03] it's quite obvious like Fiat money has
[06:05] no intrinsic value
[06:07] right um why does why doesn't it have an
[06:11] intrinsic value
[06:13] because I mean the marginal cost of
[06:17] production uh in order to produce a
[06:19] single euro is the same for like 1
[06:22] billion Euro right there no difference
[06:26] they just push a button and it's created
[06:29] digit
[06:30] right out of thin air and the big
[06:32] difference to things like Bitcoin and
[06:34] hard Assets in general you need energy
[06:38] to create Bitcoin for instance right the
[06:41] marginal cost of
[06:43] production to produce one Bitcoin is
[06:47] different than producing 10 Bitcoins
[06:50] right we know it's at least 10 times uh
[06:54] bigger right the amount of energy that
[06:56] you need and I think uh
[07:00] yeah that's the big difference but let's
[07:02] talk about like the difference between
[07:04] Central Bank Reserves and like broad
[07:07] money supply like
[07:08] M2 so
[07:11] M2 uh is a mon aggregate is it contains
[07:15] liquid and IL liquid components like
[07:18] liquid like money market funds they're
[07:20] very liquid you can trade them you can
[07:22] easily exchange them for dollars right
[07:25] like or Euros but they're also like more
[07:28] IL liquid
[07:30] um uh Mon Mon monetary assets like um
[07:34] savings plans right savings accounts I
[07:38] mean you have like at least some some
[07:40] kind of maturity maybe three months or
[07:43] one month but it's not as liquid as the
[07:46] more liquid components right like
[07:49] checking accounts super liquid but
[07:51] they're also part of M2 but they're also
[07:54] liquid stuff so this is like Commercial
[07:57] Bank money it's different from bank
[07:59] money
[08:01] because uh only central banks can create
[08:05] central bank money they they are the
[08:06] only ones who can create Central Bank
[08:10] Reserves and most people don't get this
[08:12] so they actually two types of
[08:15] monies um we as as the public The Wider
[08:19] public which also includes corporations
[08:22] and so on private
[08:24] companies we don't interact with Central
[08:27] Bank Reserves you know we don't touch
[08:29] this kind of money it's only it only
[08:32] circulates within the Comm uh with the
[08:35] interbanking system so between like
[08:38] central banks and Commercial
[08:40] Banks right and Commercial Banks need
[08:43] central bank money to fulfill fulfill
[08:46] central bank reserve requirements for
[08:49] instance but like they can't create it
[08:52] they need the central bank for this you
[08:54] know they need uh Central Bank
[08:57] Reserves how does this change when
[09:00] central banks directly issue money with
[09:02] like a cbdc that's that's an interesting
[09:04] question I mean uh the moment we have
[09:07] retail cbdcs right we can hold like
[09:11] surrogates of central bank money right
[09:14] Central Bank Reserves this might change
[09:17] right and um many people say yeah it's
[09:21] it's it's somewhat of a risk right
[09:23] privacy in privacy terms and
[09:26] whatnot but I think um the reasons why
[09:30] centr Bank want to do this is like to
[09:32] have more control over the money supply
[09:34] itself right consumer spending and so
[09:38] on uh and maybe like uh in case we have
[09:44] like um a scenario where cash is being
[09:48] abolished which is not I mean the
[09:50] central banks they keep denying it oh no
[09:52] we won't like abolish physical cash we
[09:55] won't abolish Bank notes and and coins
[09:57] right physical coins
[10:00] uh but in case we have such such a
[10:02] scenario I mean they can introduce
[10:05] whatever kind of monetary policy they
[10:07] like essentially right for for in terms
[10:10] of
[10:11] cbdcs but like I think crypto assets
[10:15] might especially Bitcoin might uh be
[10:18] some kind of exit valve you know exit
[10:22] door because
[10:24] um as we know Bitcoin is immutable it's
[10:28] censorship res resistant counterparty
[10:31] risk-free nobody can change the Monet
[10:34] policy of Bitcoin except you have a
[10:36] consensus which is very very unlikely
[10:39] right but nobody essentially can change
[10:42] the monetary policy of
[10:44] Bitcoin you don't get Negative interest
[10:47] rates when holding Bitcoin right it
[10:50] doesn't lose purchasing power over time
[10:53] to the contrary right we know the
[10:56] purchasing power of Bitcoin is rising
[10:59] and it's rising significantly against
[11:02] Fiat assets right Fiat monies especially
[11:04] but also other hard assets like real
[11:07] estate like Golds been rising against
[11:09] these
[11:11] assets so this might provide some kind
[11:13] of exit we against like cbdcs and it
[11:17] might provide like from a more political
[11:19] more democracy point of view right this
[11:24] might provide some kind of checks and
[11:25] balances yeah for like central banks not
[11:29] to abuse this kind of enlarged power
[11:34] right do you think it's possible do you
[11:37] think it's possible that like central
[11:40] banks have gold right so when when when
[11:43] they have gold they they get why they
[11:46] have to hold gold to have some kind of
[11:48] value um do you think it's possible that
[11:51] they at some point say like oh uh this
[11:53] goal is actually not doing a lot it
[11:55] stays the same measured in US dollars
[11:57] but when you measure it against Bitcoin
[11:59] it's like re um decreasing in value
[12:01] quite rapidly um do you see that it's
[12:05] possible that they at some point print
[12:07] money to to buy Bitcoin it's possible I
[12:09] mean um I think the Central Bank of El
[12:12] Salvador was already doing so some
[12:14] central banks are already doing
[12:16] it um but it's like this kind of uh
[12:20] sequence of players that it's like these
[12:23] dominoes you know that start falling you
[12:26] know uh the concept of social proof is
[12:30] really important with respect to bitcoin
[12:32] crypto Assets in general because I made
[12:36] the experience um that the moment Black
[12:40] Rock Fidelity and all the like big
[12:43] biggest asset managers in the world
[12:45] essentially issued a Bitcoin ETF in the
[12:48] US there was like this kind of career
[12:51] risks that many traditional asset
[12:54] managers had to invest into digital
[12:57] assets like Bitcoin it rapidly decreased
[13:01] right so the black rocks and
[13:05] fidelities they actually actually
[13:08] validated the investment case for like
[13:11] maybe Pension funds that are more
[13:13] conservative right maybe the other kind
[13:15] of traditional asset managers that are
[13:16] more
[13:17] conservatives and these guys they may
[13:20] validate it for like Sovereign wealth
[13:22] funds and uh as a result these guys The
[13:26] Sovereign wealth funds they start
[13:28] validating it for central banks right
[13:31] because if a sovereign wealth fund like
[13:34] starts buying Bitcoin at some point or
[13:36] any kind of other digitalist but most
[13:37] likely Bitcoin
[13:39] right then uh I mean it's just a matter
[13:43] of time be before like central banks
[13:46] themselves start buying it but they will
[13:49] probably be the very very last entities
[13:52] to do so
[13:54] because buying
[13:56] Bitcoin um implies that they have to
[14:00] sell Fiat right and
[14:04] so they increase they autom mechanically
[14:08] they will increase selling pressure on
[14:10] their fiat currency right when buying
[14:12] Bitcoin maybe at some point there will
[14:16] be speculative attacks like ah this
[14:18] Central bank's not holding enough
[14:20] Bitcoin so speculators will start
[14:23] selling the fiat currency of that Curren
[14:25] of that country right and so they will
[14:28] need to like increase their reserves in
[14:30] Bitcoin at some point that's some that's
[14:32] the kind of game theoretic scenario but
[14:35] I think like career risk and um I speak
[14:40] with many like clients asset managers
[14:42] institutional investors so career risk
[14:44] has considerably decreased the moment we
[14:48] had these um Bitcoin ETFs in the US
[14:52] right the spot Bitcoin ETF trading
[14:54] launch and you've seen that like out of
[14:57] the top 25 Global hedge funds the
[15:00] biggest H hedge funds in the world you
[15:02] see like at least half have invested
[15:04] according to the latest 13 F filings
[15:08] right at least half of them we know univ
[15:11] like Ivy leag University inment have
[15:14] invested right
[15:16] Stanford and others like uh we also know
[15:20] like like State Pension funds Wisconsin
[15:23] they have invested right it's already
[15:25] like if a State Pension funds like uh
[15:28] like Wisconsin starts to invest it also
[15:31] validates the
[15:32] case for other State Pension funds
[15:35] because they might say oh look Wisconsin
[15:38] they've invested why don't don't we
[15:40] invest right and my my thesis is so
[15:44] these Dominos start falling and my
[15:46] thesis is it used to be a career risk to
[15:50] invest into Bitcoin right and other
[15:53] crypto Assets in general it used to be
[15:56] career risk but at some point this will
[15:58] change it will flip-flop you know so it
[16:02] will be a career risk not to
[16:05] invest
[16:07] because like um we all know that like
[16:11] plenty of studies like multi-asset
[16:14] portfolio studies that show if you only
[16:17] invest like a tiny proportion of your
[16:20] portfolio into Bitcoin right uh even 1%
[16:25] you significantly
[16:27] outperform you increase your sharp Ratio
[16:29] or risk adjusted return goes up and your
[16:32] portfolio volatility only increases
[16:36] marginally so you more than
[16:40] compensated for the risk right in terms
[16:43] of returns you more than compensated
[16:45] sharp ratio goes up and even Max draw
[16:48] Downs they only increase very very
[16:51] marginally so you can easily beat your
[16:54] benchmark as a multi-asset portfolio
[16:56] manager right by including Bitcoin
[16:59] crypto Assets in general but Bitcoin we
[17:01] have most of the history for Bitcoin
[17:03] right there like plenty of studies
[17:07] already and so I think um the ones who
[17:11] will invest in Bitcoin or do invest
[17:14] right now already they will be the the
[17:18] morning stars and the liers of tomorrow
[17:21] they will get all these portfolio
[17:23] manager Awards right because I mean
[17:25] they've outperformed their Benchmark
[17:27] they've outperformed their peers
[17:29] and
[17:30] so the the pressure like from clients
[17:34] the pressure from the industry from from
[17:37] the bosses you know for portfolio
[17:40] managers will increase they will say at
[17:42] some point yeah why don't you invest I
[17:44] mean I'll go to these guys that do
[17:47] invest you know they bring more return
[17:49] than you do right why don't you invest
[17:51] in Bitcoin for instance it does make
[17:53] sense so this this pressure will
[17:56] increase and I'd say we're not there yet
[18:00] I don't think we might be at this like
[18:03] kind of threshold to this kind of
[18:05] scenario but we're not like there yet
[18:08] but I'm observing this right now we we
[18:10] see like first um asset allocators that
[18:14] start investing you know or have already
[18:18] invested and I think this will be like
[18:21] snowballing effect will become bigger
[18:23] and bigger and bigger and then at some
[18:24] point flipflop and then it will be a
[18:26] career risk not to be invested and this
[18:28] will like validate the case for other
[18:31] kind of investors and ultimately central
[18:34] banks amazing it's uh for me it's like
[18:37] when I look at the ETF and all the
[18:39] things that are happening like now
[18:41] there's the Michael Dell debate if if he
[18:43] is now investing in Bitcoin and and and
[18:45] stuff like may maybe Dell does something
[18:48] with it and he I think even sold some
[18:50] shares like a lot of that actually uh
[18:53] and and I mean this trend continued
[18:56] since like the beginning like first like
[18:58] they were only small nerds in in in
[19:00] Bitcoin the cyer punks and then it got
[19:03] to like the collector's items Staters
[19:05] then all of the sudden it actually got a
[19:07] price it actually got a market uh then
[19:10] we have public tra companies in there we
[19:12] have condas in there now we have an ETF
[19:14] like this this asset class just like
[19:17] attracts more and more players and it
[19:19] gets bigger and bigger and on bigger and
[19:21] bigger tables it's it's it's fascinating
[19:23] to see that but the Bitcoin have maybe
[19:26] let's focus a little bit on that where
[19:28] you disappointed from from the impact it
[19:31] had on on on the price did you expect
[19:33] more or was it always like it it needs
[19:37] more time to actually kick in because
[19:40] people stand behind that and they have
[19:41] to make decisions and the decision uh
[19:45] duration is just longer so I think the
[19:48] very first trading day you had like um
[19:51] disappointments but I think in general
[19:53] was I mean by far the most successful
[19:56] trading launch ever in the ETF space
[19:59] I think both Black Rock and Fidelity
[20:02] correct me if I'm wrong but I think both
[20:04] Black Rock and
[20:05] Fidelity they were the very first um
[20:09] ETFs to reach 10 billion doll assets
[20:14] under management in the shortest period
[20:16] of time I think below 100
[20:18] days so it was really really successful
[20:21] way more successful than the gold ETF
[20:23] launch in 2004 and so by that metric I
[20:26] think uh it has blown out expectations
[20:30] but um many people said like ah don't
[20:33] invest into ETF don't invest into
[20:35] Bitcoin because like ETFs are priced in
[20:37] already because
[20:39] until um the 11th of January before the
[20:43] trading launch right the price already
[20:47] kept riling right in anticipation of
[20:50] this kind of trading launch after the
[20:52] approval and so people said like at
[20:55] 42,000 when the trading launch actually
[20:58] occurred right was the price was at
[21:00] 42,000 people said that's already priced
[21:03] in right but we we said like in our
[21:06] research pieces we said like no S price
[21:09] in because the moment you see those
[21:11] flows there will be a price impact and
[21:14] we saw the price impact already right we
[21:16] went from
[21:19] 42,000 to
[21:21] $73,000 right in Bitcoin so it was not
[21:25] completely pressed in we saw those flows
[21:27] and I think um since trading launch us
[21:31] spot Bitcoin ETFs alone we saw around
[21:33] 14.5 billion almost 15 billion in net
[21:37] flows only net inflows into these um 10
[21:42] Vehicles so I think it it blew out
[21:46] expectations and you can see it also in
[21:48] the fact
[21:50] that new alltime highs before Haring are
[21:54] unprecedented I mean we reach new
[21:56] alltime highs and that was like before
[21:58] the having before like the 20th of April
[22:01] we reached
[22:04] $73,000 that was a Maj thing yeah it's a
[22:07] major thing like and the ETF flows they
[22:10] were the main sort of catalyst I think
[22:13] like from a macro perspective if you
[22:16] look at at it quantitatively it was more
[22:19] like a general increase in global risk
[22:22] upate increasing Global growth
[22:24] expectations and so on like from a macro
[22:27] perspective
[22:29] but these flows also contribute to
[22:31] certain like
[22:33] percentage Yeah and alltime High new
[22:35] alltime highs before having that's
[22:37] unprecedented but I still so that being
[22:40] said I still don't think that the ETFs
[22:43] are completely priced in now the reason
[22:46] is that and we already formulated this
[22:49] kind of investment thesis in December
[22:52] last year so what we looked at was like
[22:57] how much Capital how much money is
[22:59] actually
[23:00] sitting in passive uh ETFs in the us
[23:04] alone but only risky assets so only
[23:08] equities Commodities so developed market
[23:10] equities emerging market equities
[23:12] Commodities how much is actually in
[23:15] invested and uh I think back then was
[23:18] around7
[23:20] trillion because the market has gone up
[23:23] it's more like 8 trillion
[23:25] now but so we made this kind of thought
[23:28] experience so let's
[23:30] assume like 20% of those invested in the
[23:34] US of these ETF investors that hold
[23:37] risky asset ETFs so only passive stuff
[23:41] right they decide to like okay let's
[23:44] allocate 3% of our portfolio you know
[23:48] let's switch
[23:50] 3% so let's switch from these risky
[23:52] assets 3% which makes sense I mean you
[23:55] can like debate ah it's 20% so every
[23:58] asset manager is that reasonable
[24:00] assumption right is 3% allocation is a
[24:03] reasonable assumption but like there's
[24:06] evidence that the retail adoption rate
[24:09] in the US is around 20% already it's
[24:12] between 15 and 20% some surveys say like
[24:16] uh like Unchained they came they came
[24:19] out with surveys as like already 2
[24:22] around 25%
[24:24] right so retail adoptions close to 20%
[24:29] and most of the studies like the
[24:32] portfolio studies they imply okay 3%
[24:35] Bitcoin allocation is optimal you know
[24:39] it it maximizes your sharp ratio and so
[24:42] on um so that's these are the kind of
[24:46] assumptions so 7 trillion or around 8
[24:48] trillion now times 20% times 3% and we
[24:53] made this calculation it's very simple
[24:55] but we made this calculation back in
[24:59] December and it implied around 30 to 40
[25:04] billion US dollars in potential
[25:08] flows and we have already seen like 14
[25:12] to 15 billion but still it implies we
[25:15] have haven't even seen like half of
[25:18] these potential flows you know we have
[25:21] probably seen only like one3 or 40% of
[25:24] potential
[25:25] flows and you know that's the story with
[25:28] these warehouses in US you mean there
[25:30] are certain Distributors fund
[25:33] Distributors so the whole infrastructure
[25:35] is not completely set up you know for
[25:39] perfect distribution and this will take
[25:41] time as you mentioned I mean um until we
[25:44] have these kind of distribution channels
[25:46] set up funds have uh done their due
[25:49] diligence and so on this takes time
[25:52] right it's at least half a year and so
[25:55] my hypothesis is still it's not Preston
[25:59] right we will see continuing flows into
[26:02] Bitcoin ETFs you will probably have the
[26:05] ethereum ETF launch I think in July
[26:09] maybe at the end of summer I think Bal
[26:11] junas he revised his latest expectations
[26:14] to like either 8th of July or end of
[26:17] summer but anyway so it's probably
[26:19] earlier than
[26:21] expected and probably have some even
[26:24] salana ETF launch who knows but like I
[26:27] think if you like concentrate on bitcoin
[26:30] right now it's you haven't probably even
[26:33] seen half of potential
[26:35] inflows and it's interesting because
[26:37] when we see uh bitcoin price movements
[26:40] usually like in the past cycle movements
[26:43] and it's no guarantee that it does the
[26:44] same thing every cycle because the
[26:46] cycles and the Haring has less and less
[26:47] impact but usually like the 18 months
[26:51] after the Haring are the best months to
[26:53] be in in in Bitcoin uh and then we have
[26:57] the special situation that right before
[26:58] the Haring Bitcoin ETF which unlocks a
[27:02] lot of capital um uh is launched and we
[27:06] even had the alltime high before the
[27:09] Haring yes uh and then we also have to
[27:12] factor in that most of this ETFs
[27:14] probably take like half a year to a year
[27:16] to really allocate and really get in
[27:18] there and we already have now um quite
[27:21] good of amount of flows uh and then
[27:24] another factor is like when the price
[27:26] shoots up there will be more pressure on
[27:30] those asset allocation on the asset
[27:32] managers like hey why don't you have
[27:34] Bitcoin like this 20% might be coming up
[27:36] to like 40% of the asset manager like
[27:39] getting into Bitcoin maybe this 3% gets
[27:41] to like five six% it's like the if if
[27:45] you change a little bit of the variables
[27:46] it it's it's a it's really quickly uh uh
[27:51] a really big Snowball Effect that could
[27:53] happen happen in the next like 18 months
[27:56] MH now to my question what what do you
[27:58] think um what what do you think is
[28:01] possible uh for Bitcoin in the
[28:04] next 8 to 18
[28:07] months let's start with the Haring right
[28:09] because such a huge event so my
[28:12] hypothesis is Haring is not priced
[28:15] in despite the fact that we we red to
[28:19] new alltime highs before the Haring so
[28:21] everyone Al also said again again right
[28:25] Haring is pric in right
[28:29] but I think uh it's not priced in for
[28:31] the following reasons so we did some
[28:33] research into past
[28:35] hars so goes without saying there's been
[28:38] huge price appreciations post Haring
[28:41] right I think it was 17x 500 Days on
[28:45] average
[28:46] 17x 500 days after the Haring so that
[28:50] includes like the past three hings
[28:51] before the latest one which is which are
[28:55] 2012 2016 and 2020 so
[29:00] 17x uh but what's even more important is
[29:04] there's such a huge performance
[29:06] difference between performance post
[29:10] Haring and preh Haring so performance
[29:12] for instance like 20 days after the
[29:15] Haring minus 20 days before the Haring
[29:19] 50 days after the Haring 50 days before
[29:21] the Haring and so on so if you like
[29:24] calculate these performance differences
[29:26] and then you get some kind of yeah
[29:27] performance difference it's positive
[29:30] most of the time and it's positively
[29:32] skewed towards post Haring so you see
[29:36] significantly higher performance post
[29:39] harving than preh harving and you can
[29:41] even measure this statistically and you
[29:43] can test it whether it's significant
[29:45] and uh when you look at the significance
[29:49] the Haring itself doesn't really become
[29:53] significant around yeah 100 days after
[29:56] the Haring
[29:58] then it starts to become increasingly
[30:00] significant then the most significant
[30:02] around 400 days after the Haring and
[30:05] totally makes sense you know because at
[30:08] first I mean the Haring effect is not
[30:12] it's not much right we have like a
[30:14] supply deficit of 450 Bitcoins per day
[30:18] right so M Supply was cut in half it
[30:22] decreased from 900 Bitcoins minus 50% to
[30:26] 450 Bitcoins
[30:28] so we have like a
[30:30] 450 Bitcoin Supply deficit compared to
[30:34] preh Haring
[30:36] right on the very first day it's like
[30:39] 450 Bitcoins only Supply deficit but on
[30:42] the second day it's like 9900 Bitcoins
[30:45] Supply deficit on the third day is 1,350
[30:50] Bitcoins Supply deficit and so on so it
[30:52] tends to accumulate over
[30:55] time right and that's our explanation
[30:59] why you don't see like a huge
[31:01] significance at the beginning and that's
[31:04] a time lag you know of this
[31:07] effect which takes hold around 100 days
[31:10] after Haring and then becomes
[31:11] increasingly significant and so 100 days
[31:14] after the harving would imply so we had
[31:17] the harving event on the 20th of April
[31:19] this would imply that it will become
[31:22] significant around August so summer end
[31:26] of summer it will start
[31:28] like affect the price of Bitcoin and so
[31:32] when you think like ah is it priced in
[31:34] or not priced in what we also did was
[31:37] like we built a quantitative model I
[31:39] mean disclaimer at this point yeah all
[31:42] models are wrong but some are useful
[31:44] right it's just a quantitative model uh
[31:46] but it only
[31:48] contains the Haring effect
[31:52] right uh but also it considers the fact
[31:56] that the marginal effect of each Haring
[31:59] decreases over
[32:01] time
[32:02] because um I mean the last having we
[32:07] went from 6.25 Bitcoins to
[32:09] 3.125 right and
[32:13] 3.125 in terms of the current Supply in
[32:17] percentage terms is way way less than
[32:21] like the very first harving where we
[32:23] went from like 50 Bitcoins per 10 minute
[32:26] blocks right to 25 Bitcoins so and the
[32:31] supply was like less than 10 million
[32:33] coins right so percentage wise the
[32:36] Haring effect the earlier ones they were
[32:39] way more significant right and so but
[32:42] even if you consider this kind of effect
[32:44] so Haring effect plus the fact that the
[32:47] marginal effect will like um will
[32:50] decrease over time so we found out that
[32:55] the new kind of equilibrium price
[32:57] according according to this model is
[33:00] around
[33:01] $103,000 by the end of this year and
[33:06] $172,000 by the end of next year and the
[33:09] funny thing is it now starts to like it
[33:13] will now be a TA Tailwind for the price
[33:16] it will now start to support the price
[33:20] because uh in the run up to the Haring
[33:22] and we just talked about this right we
[33:24] had like new alltime highs before the
[33:26] Haring so we had we had some kind of
[33:28] decoupling from this equilibrium price
[33:31] the price was too hot right valuations
[33:34] were somewhat on the expensive side but
[33:37] now that we had this correction right to
[33:40] $58,000 again valuations have been have
[33:44] become more attractive they've been
[33:46] they've been closer to fair value also
[33:49] according to this model but we have all
[33:51] other kinds of valuation models that
[33:53] signal the
[33:54] same so we are more in line with fair
[33:57] value now
[33:58] and we yeah coincidentally we've touched
[34:01] this point where like this kind of
[34:03] harving effect now becomes a Tailwind
[34:05] you know and I think it will become like
[34:08] a significant Tailwind starting around
[34:10] August thank you you already made it
[34:12] halfway through the video and I'm really
[34:14] really grateful to have you here two
[34:16] things make this channel possible you as
[34:19] a watcher and listener who keep
[34:21] supporting this Channel and another one
[34:23] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[34:25] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[34:28] from the very start and where I
[34:30] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[34:32] Robin you even get a discount when you
[34:34] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[34:36] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[34:39] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[34:42] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[34:44] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[34:47] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[34:49] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[34:53] bracket and if you have self- custody
[34:55] and you know your friend does not have
[34:56] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[34:58] he needs a birthday present and a small
[35:00] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[35:03] 5% off your order plus you support my
[35:06] channel and now let's get back to the
[35:08] video there was an I think a really
[35:10] in-depth video that I once saw for like
[35:13] it was like one hour something like that
[35:15] who said who said like the the Bitcoin
[35:17] price is never really priced in because
[35:20] uh it's not only about the financial
[35:22] side of things but also about
[35:25] psychology uh and like when everybody
[35:27] except everybody expects something uh
[35:30] it's like it's more likely to happen
[35:32] than
[35:32] not uh and it's it will be interesting
[35:35] because as you said like we have now 92
[35:38] or 3% of the supply already mined so
[35:41] there's not a lot of new Supply coming
[35:44] anyways and it I think was what was it
[35:47] 90 2035 I think we have 99% of the
[35:51] supply was it 2030 something around this
[35:54] lines and then we only need like 1% and
[35:57] this 1% takes like till
[35:59] 2140 so so the having in itself has less
[36:05] and less impact and will have in like 10
[36:07] 20 years almost no impact on new Supply
[36:09] it's
[36:10] like so small as an impact but it will
[36:13] be interesting if if it actually
[36:15] continues and then we also have like as
[36:17] you mentioned uh models I think sale is
[36:20] the most popular one for saying all
[36:22] models will break like
[36:24] once someone big enough comes in breaks
[36:28] with like when when there's a town turn
[36:29] and in the town turn Apple decides to
[36:32] convert 20% of their balance sheet to
[36:34] bitcoin and then all the fear of missing
[36:37] out and all the all the news like this
[36:40] probably will shoot up the price to
[36:42] maybe like 5x so depending on where we
[36:45] are but uh like this is really
[36:48] interesting for me and on the one side
[36:49] I'm just huddling I'm just like 100% in
[36:51] Bitcoin anyways like I really don't care
[36:53] what the price is because I I adopted a
[36:55] Bitcoin standard but still it's
[36:57] interesting to think about like where
[36:59] will we go and it's for me also
[37:02] interesting because I have a lot of
[37:05] people that watch me on the podcast that
[37:07] are already bitcoiners and just want to
[37:09] learn more about the asset and want to
[37:11] learn more about from other bitcoiners
[37:13] but there's also always a certain
[37:15] percentage that are curious about
[37:17] Bitcoin and don't have Bitcoin and just
[37:19] like I want to check out a few episodes
[37:21] and and want to see what what Bitcoin is
[37:23] about and what I learned when I put
[37:26] price predi or Price things in there
[37:29] this attracts more um more outside of
[37:33] the Bitcoin Community like if you're
[37:35] really a
[37:36] bitcoiner they don't care that much
[37:38] about Bitcoin even like even if I put
[37:40] like a price Target in the thumbnail
[37:42] they are like oh why do they put like
[37:44] this is clickbait like they they're not
[37:46] as they they even on the other side were
[37:49] like ah we don't like this kind of a
[37:51] Content but it attracts new people it
[37:53] attracts uh outside of the Bitcoin
[37:55] public people are like oh this bit thing
[37:57] is is still still there uh and it might
[38:00] go up like let's let's check let's check
[38:02] it out and so I think we even as a
[38:05] Bitcoin we have an obligation to to talk
[38:08] the normi language to talk the language
[38:11] outside of our Bitcoin bubble uh and and
[38:14] tell like this is the potential of
[38:16] Bitcoin like there we can go because
[38:18] most people are like Oh Where Can the an
[38:20] asset go and then they they think in
[38:23] like dollar DMS a lot of Bitcoin already
[38:26] don't think like that most people most
[38:28] bitco even do it um but uh where do you
[38:32] see like when we see like the the the
[38:36] bigger picture in like 10 years 50 years
[38:39] do you have some sort of model I mean
[38:41] it's really hard to predict because a
[38:43] lot of things can happen but do you have
[38:44] some sort of model where you had this is
[38:47] the the Bitcoin price for really long
[38:48] term this is the Bitcoin price for uh
[38:51] where where we see it uh going I think
[38:54] 100,000 for the end of the year is a
[38:55] really cool and and
[38:58] really realistic Target I feel like we
[39:00] we probably overshoot that but we can
[39:02] also undershoot it but it's it's a
[39:04] realistic and good Target I feel like um
[39:07] but where do you see long term uh going
[39:09] when we have all those those strengths
[39:10] that we talked about in the
[39:13] day I think it's really interesting
[39:15] because like there's so many variables
[39:18] that influence the price of Bitcoin I
[39:19] mean obviously one is scarcity and we
[39:21] just talked about the harving effect um
[39:23] the other one is
[39:25] adoption but as you said like normies
[39:28] and like The Wider population they of
[39:30] course they look at
[39:31] price and um the funny thing and there's
[39:35] lots of research I think by the bis bank
[39:37] for international settlements they've
[39:39] done some crypto research as well and
[39:40] they looked at like retail
[39:42] adoption and it's not like adoption
[39:45] drives price it's the other way around
[39:48] price drives
[39:51] adoption so the moment you have increase
[39:54] in performance increase in like price
[39:56] but a signific one of course people
[39:59] start talking about it increasing
[40:02] acceleration and
[40:03] adoption and you can see in the data as
[40:06] well if you they're like Global ID
[40:08] verified crypto users I think the data
[40:10] from crypto.com from The Exchange uh it
[40:14] really shows that adoption itself is
[40:17] cycling so you have the highest growth
[40:19] rates in adoption highest user growth in
[40:22] Bull markets and lowest user growth in
[40:24] bare markets it makes sense right and
[40:27] you also have like the most uh exchange
[40:31] app downloads during bull markets and
[40:35] yeah the least in bare markets it's
[40:37] totally normal and it's it's just part
[40:40] of human psychology you know we desire
[40:43] things that go up in
[40:45] price
[40:47] right because some way in some way it
[40:51] can face okay this is this is valuable
[40:53] you know that's also social proof others
[40:56] are valuing this this is going up this
[40:58] is
[40:59] interesting and so you see this
[41:01] increasing
[41:02] adoption but like in terms of the
[41:04] longterm view I think
[41:07] many many people are following this kind
[41:09] of power law model right and it it it's
[41:13] based
[41:14] in like y psychology adoption Cycles
[41:18] like how do viruses spread right virus
[41:22] spread spread more like exponentially
[41:24] power law is more
[41:26] like the power law model assumes that
[41:29] growth
[41:30] rates will decrease over time so it will
[41:34] continue to grow but like over time the
[41:37] growth rate will decrease and you have
[41:39] this kind of concave curve right that's
[41:42] the power model and like you mentioned
[41:46] um Michael sailor all your models will
[41:49] be destroyed I mean for me this is still
[41:51] a possibility I'm still in the camp of
[41:53] some kind of like scarcity model the one
[41:56] I've mentioned Haring but also power law
[41:59] model which perfectly duft tals this
[42:02] kind of model because the the Haring
[42:04] effects also decrease over time right
[42:08] but I think it's we shouldn't rule out
[42:11] this kind of extreme scenario of
[42:13] hyperbitcoinization
[42:16] right because I think when when M guys
[42:19] like Michael sailor says say like ah all
[42:21] your models will be destroyed right they
[42:24] implicitly mean hyperbitcoinization
[42:26] right so
[42:28] so uh for me hyperbitcoinization
[42:31] is
[42:33] um when adoption starts to accelerate
[42:36] like
[42:38] significantly and I think it's it's
[42:40] somewhat this kind of probability is not
[42:43] zero it's definitely higher than zero
[42:45] because like you've probably seen these
[42:48] recent videos of trump talking about
[42:50] like 50 million crypto users in the US
[42:53] already and some surveys I've just seen
[42:56] them they imply like 90 million
[42:58] users but I think most of these like
[43:01] surveys they imply like 50 to 60 million
[43:04] some say is like 40 million adults right
[43:08] but in general I think 50 million is
[43:10] probably a good number so and they're
[43:12] like 50 million uh dogs in
[43:16] us right so if you're against crypto and
[43:21] Bitcoin then it's like you are against
[43:23] dogs right
[43:25] now so that's a nice comparison you know
[43:28] it's politically not feasible anymore
[43:31] it's like political suicide to be
[43:33] against crypto because you lose out on
[43:35] 50 million voters potentially right and
[43:38] I think Trump realized this he realized
[43:42] okay I can gain a majority by advocating
[43:45] Bitcoin mining crypto in general like
[43:48] Pro crypto legislation in the US right
[43:53] Trump trump had a had a need to know
[43:56] about Bitcoin and he now has to adopted
[43:59] he's like I have to be for it otherwise
[44:01] I I don't get the voters and so I think
[44:06] why that's important
[44:07] so um crypto is influencing the
[44:10] presidential election right already so
[44:13] it implies that adoption rate in the US
[44:15] is already relatively high so if it
[44:19] already influences the election must be
[44:23] significantly high right now and like
[44:25] I've said like most service they imply
[44:28] like yeah 15 to 20% retail adoption and
[44:32] we know from these models of Technologic
[44:35] adoption for instance the Roger spell
[44:37] curve very classical model you have the
[44:40] the um innovators very first guys who
[44:43] adopt the technology then you have like
[44:45] the bit early Bitcoin minus
[44:48] Satoshi um Bitcoin M mailing list and so
[44:51] on bitcoin talk.org org guys then you
[44:56] have the um the early early adopters
[45:00] right which so innovators plus early
[45:03] adopters is around
[45:06] 15% so 15% retail adoption is very early
[45:10] still but then you have this kind of
[45:13] threshold which is between 15% and then
[45:16] the rest you know afterwards because
[45:19] that threshold is a threshold to early
[45:21] majority and the reason why that's
[45:23] important is after the early adopters
[45:27] and after the threshold to early
[45:29] majority you have an acceleration in
[45:33] adoption rate like it's really starts to
[45:35] take off and um I think like the Bitcoin
[45:39] ET ETFs in the US they've they've like
[45:42] they've really accelerated Bitcoin
[45:44] adoption across the United States and
[45:47] that's my
[45:48] explanation why it's so important for
[45:50] the presidential election as well you
[45:55] know yeah I wouldn't rule out that this
[45:58] like that we have some kind of
[45:59] hyperbitcoinization
[46:01] because we're exactly this threshold
[46:04] especially in the
[46:05] US where adoption really starts to take
[46:09] off starts to accelerate and then maybe
[46:12] like the harving model that I've just
[46:15] mentioned is will be completely
[46:17] destroyed right then the power law model
[46:21] right will be completely destroyed
[46:23] because they're in my view they're more
[46:24] like the conservative types of model
[46:26] they imply like concave like shape of
[46:31] the price over time if we have
[46:34] hyperbitcoinization
[46:35] then price really starts to go
[46:38] exponential again you see uh when we
[46:40] talk about hyper pronation I also feel
[46:42] like different people have different
[46:45] imaginations of how this look like how
[46:47] does it look for you like when when you
[46:49] talk about hyperbitcoinization what what
[46:51] what do you mean by
[46:52] that yeah Mass adoption essentially so
[46:57] because like if you go on Twitter you
[46:59] see many people say ah we're still early
[47:01] look at this we're still early but I
[47:03] don't think we're that early anymore you
[47:06] know my hypothesis is since the Bitcoin
[47:09] ETF trading
[47:11] launch adoption has been accelerating
[47:14] right and as I've mentioned it it's
[47:18] quite usual to see an increase
[47:20] acceleration in adoption rates during
[47:22] bull markets right and if this bull
[47:24] market continues uh which I
[47:28] expect we will see even more adoption
[47:31] more adoption growth and because we're
[47:33] at this
[47:35] threshold it's like a it's like a domino
[47:38] effect you know if you have like a
[47:39] certain percentage of the population I
[47:42] think you only need around like 15 or
[47:45] even some theories they only imply like
[47:47] you need 10% of the population as kind
[47:50] of influences and then like Mass
[47:53] adoption is almost a given you know so
[47:56] there's something theories that imply
[47:57] this but like uh like I've said surveys
[48:00] imply like 15 to 20% retail adoption
[48:03] usually starts to take off and that's
[48:04] like the point to early majority and the
[48:08] moment you have the early majority you
[48:09] have mass adoption because then adoption
[48:13] rate is above 50% so more than every
[48:17] second American will have Bitcoin or
[48:20] crypto asset I think what uh when when
[48:23] when people say we're early because
[48:25] there's like for me there's difference
[48:27] between how many people have Bitcoin and
[48:31] how many people actually have a lot of
[48:33] Bitcoin and I'm not talking about how
[48:36] many Bitcoin per say they have but how
[48:38] many percentage of the net worth from
[48:40] them personally is Bitcoin because I
[48:43] think that we will reach quite soon the
[48:46] point where a lot of people have some
[48:50] percentage to bitcoin because when we
[48:53] have ETFs now and and we even have like
[48:56] you could make an argument because Tesla
[48:58] has Bitcoin and maybe micro strategy is
[49:00] also soon in the S&P 500 everyone that
[49:02] has the S&P 500 has some exposure to
[49:05] bitcoin it's not a Bitcoin user in my
[49:08] opinion but you can make an argument
[49:10] it's it's it's in the Bitcoin Market
[49:12] kind of um and so like depending on like
[49:16] what's one Bitcoin use like when do you
[49:20] adopt Bitcoin is it when you have some
[49:22] exposure to the Bitcoin price or do you
[49:25] have like 10% of your portfolio at least
[49:27] to to be in Bitcoin or you actually uh
[49:31] are you only actual bitcoiner who
[49:33] adopted Bitcoin if you have self custody
[49:35] Bitcoin with a hard wallet because then
[49:37] this whole different thing um we have
[49:40] studies where they shown like only 2% of
[49:43] all
[49:44] bitcoiners uh or it might be actually
[49:47] crypto study I think there was a crypto
[49:49] study all all all uh crypto holders uh
[49:52] of them only 2% of them actually hold
[49:55] Hardware wallet
[49:57] uh so like uh most people have it on on
[50:00] Exchange or or somewhere else uh so like
[50:04] depending on on what we see early
[50:07] because when we really look at how many
[50:09] people actually understood Bitcoin and
[50:11] how many people actually got Bitcoin
[50:13] it's a really small amount of uh of
[50:17] people but then again I don't think most
[50:20] people will ever get Bitcoin but most
[50:22] people will have Bitcoin like how many
[50:26] people people understand gold or an ETF
[50:29] or whatever they just buy it because
[50:32] they know intrinsically it has value and
[50:34] they need it like most most people never
[50:37] question what is money and never
[50:39] question what what they're doing so it's
[50:43] a really interesting debate for me where
[50:45] are we with the adoption because you can
[50:47] make an argument for we have 1% adoption
[50:50] or you can an argument know we have 20%
[50:52] adoption depending on what metric also
[50:54] you're looking at um but
[50:57] I think we are early from a price
[50:59] development um but it is massive how far
[51:03] we have already come especially with the
[51:05] ETF and everything we have a country in
[51:07] Bitcoin that's stacking one Bitcoin a
[51:09] day that that's that's massive like
[51:12] that's really
[51:13] good yes so I mean you're absolutely
[51:16] right because uh when I worked at uh my
[51:19] former former company in the traditional
[51:22] financial sector we had a pilot
[51:24] investment in Bitcoin right and AIT coin
[51:27] ETP and it was only one pilot investment
[51:30] but we got these surveys that asked like
[51:33] ah are you already invested in digital
[51:35] assets like Bitcoin and so we ticked yes
[51:38] right and that means okay adoption rate
[51:41] for this compan is yes right they
[51:42] adopted Bitcoin but like we had a pilot
[51:45] investment it was like a tiny percentage
[51:47] of like the overall company assets right
[51:51] that were invested so it it totally
[51:53] makes sense what you're saying at the
[51:55] same time I don't think like owning a
[51:58] hardware wallet is like a necessary
[52:00] condition to like or even like getting
[52:02] Bitcoin to be invested or adop Bitcoin
[52:05] right because like many people they use
[52:09] planes
[52:11] right but most people I mean you do
[52:15] somehow somehow understand how it works
[52:18] but like the very very Basics but not
[52:20] like the nitty-gritty of like how a
[52:22] plane works right but still we use the
[52:24] plane right and same I mean the best
[52:27] example is even Fiat money right if you
[52:30] ask like where does money come from like
[52:34] and I think uh my professor he used to
[52:37] he used to do these kind of surveys with
[52:39] students even like economic students
[52:43] this this not like the general
[52:44] population they're even more like
[52:47] they're more prone to answer this
[52:49] question correctly right I mean at least
[52:53] they're supposed to but so they as
[52:55] students where does money come from and
[52:58] like the majority said like the
[53:01] government which is wrong you know
[53:04] because like the options were government
[53:06] Central Bank commercial Banks and then I
[53:08] don't know foreign uh offshore or or
[53:12] anything and so they said the majority
[53:15] ticked 90% around 90% ticked like ah
[53:19] it's coming from the government that's
[53:21] wrong I mean the majority the large
[53:24] majority of money supplies originating
[53:27] from the banking sector
[53:29] right the government itself can't print
[53:33] money and the central banks not the
[53:35] government they're independent of the
[53:37] government right the ECB is independent
[53:39] so and so V vast majority is coming from
[53:42] the uh banking sector and especially
[53:45] commercial Banks it's not even the
[53:47] central bank it's the commercial banks
[53:50] that create the majority of the money
[53:52] supply and so most people don't
[53:55] understand where does money come from
[53:56] from how does it actually work right but
[53:59] still they use money dayto day and I
[54:01] think we'll be not I hope not similarly
[54:05] but like similar but probably most
[54:08] people who use Bitcoin at some point in
[54:10] time when we've reached Mass
[54:12] adoption most people probably at least
[54:15] my
[54:17] prediction um they probably won't
[54:20] understand how Bitcoin really really
[54:22] works the tech behind it you know and so
[54:24] on because I think that's the same like
[54:27] Bitcoin com
[54:29] combines um the the stuff that people
[54:33] don't know about the banking system with
[54:36] stuff that they don't know about tech
[54:39] right so it's really harsh combination
[54:41] of things most people don't understand
[54:45] right and we have really interesting
[54:48] example with email servers uh I I had a
[54:51] podcast guest on and and he was a little
[54:54] older uh than me I think he was like 67
[54:57] or something like that so bit bit a lot
[55:01] older than me um and he said in the
[55:03] early internet adoption when emails and
[55:06] so on came out uh and he was really
[55:09] involved in there most experts in there
[55:12] actually thought everyone will have run
[55:15] their own email
[55:17] servers but they did not uh saw the
[55:20] future as we see it now as like 90% of
[55:24] people are at gmail I don't know
[55:28] maybe like 99% I don't know how many
[55:30] people onmail but most people are on
[55:31] Gmail or some centralized servers like
[55:33] they probably like
[55:35] five servic that most people are on uh
[55:39] and there are like this two hearts in in
[55:41] in me that the one is the the rational
[55:43] that that sees the world and and and
[55:45] sees the the people around me that are
[55:48] even like I have friends that are 100%
[55:50] in Bitcoin in the all Hoon exchange even
[55:53] though I tell them the fifth hundredth
[55:55] time to get a hardware wallet and to at
[55:58] least educate themselves on that topic
[56:01] to at least get some knowledge about
[56:02] that um and uh then then I see also like
[56:07] all the surveys and all those statistics
[56:08] that not a lot of Hardware wallets and
[56:10] everything but then there's also this
[56:12] this this heart in me like I want people
[56:15] to actually not only get the number gr
[56:17] technology but also the freedom gr
[56:19] technology uh because when you actually
[56:21] take self custody you can take
[56:23] advantages like you can uh take your bit
[56:26] coin over bers without anyone
[56:28] interfering with that you can do with
[56:29] Bitcoin way more than than just getting
[56:32] wealthy from it the getting wealthy part
[56:34] is is the most important to most people
[56:38] uh but having transactions that cannot
[56:40] be stopped like talk to any activist
[56:44] group that has ever been stopped with
[56:46] with funds and and and and fundraisers
[56:48] and stuff like that they love Bitcoin
[56:50] because you can set up a lightning or
[56:52] Bitcoin address everyone can fund there
[56:55] and no nobody can stop that from
[56:57] happening it's really really hard to
[56:59] stop that from happening like I always
[57:02] make that extreme example if you have if
[57:04] you're at home and thief comes in there
[57:07] and and holds like a gun to the uh to
[57:10] the head of your wife um if you have
[57:14] gold in that scenario he can shoot
[57:16] everyone and then get your gold no
[57:19] matter if you want it or not with
[57:21] Bitcoin even though you probably give it
[57:23] to
[57:24] him with Bitcoin you have the choice to
[57:28] die and take your Bitcoin with you
[57:31] that's an extreme example but it shows
[57:34] you how create the property rights of
[57:38] Bitcoin are and I always encourage
[57:39] everyone to even if you don't want to
[57:42] hold it yourself even if you like for
[57:44] some reason Can Only Hold the ETF even
[57:47] in that scenario get yourself a hard
[57:49] wallet for like 50 EUR or 100 EUR and
[57:53] and experience with that I did that like
[57:55] I
[57:56] Quick St like I when I thought three
[57:58] years that Bitcoin is a scam and then uh
[58:02] people challenge me and ask me questions
[58:04] about it then I was like oh I ran
[58:05] out of arguments so I was researching
[58:07] about it uh and in the on Friday I
[58:11] thought it's a scam on Sunday I thought
[58:13] okay it might be something uh but I I
[58:17] didn't I did not fully understand it I
[58:20] only was like okay it might be more than
[58:21] a
[58:22] scam uh on a Monday I bought uh
[58:26] made open the coinbase account on
[58:28] Tuesday even though I was not sure if
[58:30] Bitcoin is anything I bought a ledger
[58:33] because I wanted to got to know the
[58:34] technology like even if you have um an
[58:38] if you're an a 60y old guy who has a
[58:43] million in Bitcoin ETF because you're
[58:46] rich and you accomplish a lot in your
[58:47] life and you don't want to deal with
[58:50] technology like take out the day buy a
[58:54] bit boox and and try out what what's
[58:57] possible with the techn like just to uh
[59:00] enhance your your your knowledge about
[59:02] the technology like this is what I also
[59:04] always try to to get but I think most
[59:07] people won't most people won't yeah it's
[59:11] fine I mean uh there are different
[59:14] solutions um and I mean providers right
[59:19] like us I mean Etc group um we have the
[59:22] bit biggest Bitcoin ETP in Europe so
[59:25] there always pros and
[59:26] right like hardcore Bitcoin Maxis they
[59:29] will say oh don't mess in the Bitcoin
[59:32] ETP it's easier for retail investors
[59:36] right I mean you get a hardware wallet
[59:38] you you take your coins off exchange you
[59:41] store an Hardware wallet maybe you uh
[59:44] you memorize your seat phrase right then
[59:46] you if you die you take the Bitcoins
[59:48] with you right but like for
[59:50] institutional investors it's not that
[59:52] easy right like Key Management you
[59:56] there's always risk right pros and cons
[59:59] so of course if you do self-
[60:02] custody um the pro is censorship
[60:06] resistant counterparty risk-free right
[60:08] you don't have the service provider the
[60:10] fund administrator custodian whatever
[60:13] but you you have risk of uh losing your
[60:16] keys right getting robbed or
[60:19] whatever and for institutions this is a
[60:22] real risk they don't want to like they
[60:25] don't want to do Key Management they
[60:29] they want us you know to do the custody
[60:30] for them we use also other service
[60:33] providers who are super professional in
[60:35] terms of Key
[60:37] Management but at the same time we also
[60:40] think like okay uh I mean we have
[60:42] blockchain Tech but then we have a new
[60:45] layer like an
[60:46] ETP I mean it it takes all these
[60:50] advantages from decentralized Tech from
[60:53] counterparty risk-free and censorship
[60:56] resistance and so on but what what we do
[60:58] is like the assets are
[61:00] segregated right so for instance our
[61:03] company goes bust the assets are
[61:05] segregated they're not part of like the
[61:09] um bankruptcy right and also we what we
[61:13] also do is like we provide proof of
[61:16] Holdings so I mean what's the case and
[61:20] using I mean having this kind of
[61:22] transparency having blockchain like
[61:25] Bitcoin or or ethereum and you don't
[61:28] provide the public addresses right so we
[61:31] do and this is others like bitwise they
[61:34] also do this but we we have been one of
[61:37] the first to do this even before bitwise
[61:40] so what we do is like we provide all the
[61:44] public addresses for all our Bitcoin
[61:46] Holdings you know and so you can check
[61:49] in real time are my Bitcoins actually
[61:51] there right and so on
[61:54] so uh we have an independent
[61:56] administrator that checks all the
[61:58] transactions as well like third party
[62:01] and so on so they like many many
[62:03] Security checks and balances the funds
[62:06] are
[62:07] segregated of course the the con is like
[62:11] okay you don't have this kind of
[62:14] counterparty risk- free anymore but at
[62:16] the same time you don't have loss uh the
[62:19] risk of losing your
[62:21] keys um you have very high liquidity in
[62:24] the sometimes what's funny is the etps
[62:28] the Securities based on bitcoin have
[62:31] sometimes even tighter spreads so less
[62:34] costs trading crosss than the underlying
[62:37] BTC the reason is that we have market
[62:40] makers you know we pay them so they make
[62:44] tight spreads so if you're trading BTC
[62:46] which I mean I don't recommend trading
[62:48] BTC I mean makes sense to bind hold
[62:51] right hardle and so on in the investment
[62:54] case because like like there's so many
[62:57] studies do you know this kind of rule of
[62:59] 10 I know so if you lose out on the 10
[63:03] best days over the past five years
[63:07] you've you've essentially fled on
[63:09] bitcoin because like most of the
[63:11] performance made on like yeah 10
[63:14] days and so it's good luck finding thing
[63:18] yes exactly it makes more sense to buy
[63:21] and hold like hardle right long term
[63:25] than to try and trade the market right
[63:29] like like like we said before like
[63:30] before the we we started the podcast the
[63:34] the time in the market is more important
[63:37] than timing the market essentially
[63:41] right and so um yeah also les by the way
[63:45] this is really an really important
[63:47] feature so I talked about the ETP but
[63:51] what we also do is like so in case we
[63:53] have a client a retail client who says
[63:54] like I want to have the real coins like
[63:58] give me the real coins because the
[64:01] shares they're like a claim on the the
[64:04] underlying coins because it's 100%
[64:06] collateralized so a client can come to
[64:08] us and say like I want to have delivery
[64:11] of the of the underlying Bitcoin and so
[64:14] we we deliver them their kind of
[64:15] Hardware wallet and so they get the the
[64:18] coins like physically in a hardware
[64:20] wallet you know that's also possible
[64:23] that's really cool I love that is that
[64:26] also with the American ETFs you know
[64:28] that I don't know whether they have
[64:31] delivery option and they're not all
[64:33] European etps offer this kind of deliver
[64:37] option but we do this because of certain
[64:40] tax advantages in Germany as well
[64:42] because you have a better more
[64:45] beneficial tax advantage tax treatment
[64:48] in
[64:48] Germany and it's also like it's more
[64:52] creates more trust because I mean then
[64:54] you can always like get get your
[64:56] underlying Bitcoin especially with the
[64:58] uh when when
[65:00] you publicize your addresses then
[65:04] everyone can say okay at least that much
[65:06] Bitcoin you actually have like when you
[65:08] when you have like you might have more
[65:10] that you don't publicize but probably
[65:12] not but at least that that many Bitcoin
[65:14] are there uh and and this is this is
[65:17] great that nothing like an FDX thing
[65:20] happens where they have like what did
[65:21] they had two Bitcoin or something like
[65:22] that in their reserve and the the rest
[65:25] was
[65:26] LA and air I think that's what started
[65:30] this whole thing about like proof of
[65:32] Holdings proof of
[65:33] reserves right that that's when like
[65:36] binance also started at some point to
[65:38] like publish their proof of Holdings and
[65:40] so on I mean most onchain data
[65:44] providers they um they look at the data
[65:48] they try to like segregate Tech them
[65:50] Tech Exchange wallets and then aggregate
[65:53] like exchange balances for instance
[65:55] Bitcoin exchange balances on coinbase
[65:58] Bitcoin exchange balances on binance and
[66:00] so on so I mean you don't need the
[66:02] exchanges to tell you that you know that
[66:05] the proof of Holdings because you have
[66:08] crypto Quant glass node and so on non
[66:10] they all do this kind of exchange wallet
[66:13] tagging and so you can track them if you
[66:15] have these data providers but of course
[66:17] like for the wider public that don't
[66:20] subscribe to these data providers it's
[66:22] probably a good thing yeah amazing
[66:26] perfect then I already saw that we
[66:28] already of over the one hour mark uh and
[66:31] we have Ting in the podcast that uh is
[66:34] two questions the one question is always
[66:36] the same and the other one question
[66:37] comes from the previous guest without
[66:39] knowing who the next guest actually is
[66:41] um let's start with the question that is
[66:43] for everyone the same um it's it's a
[66:45] question that I asked because I think
[66:48] Bitcoin are unique people and we can
[66:50] learn from each other outside of what
[66:52] money is outside of the things we we
[66:55] talk about at length in the podcast H so
[66:57] the question is what are you currently
[66:59] passionate about besides Bitcoin what
[67:02] are you doing outside of the Bitcoin
[67:04] group to finance uh
[67:07] space so I'm passionate about my family
[67:09] I have two sons one is one year old and
[67:13] my Elder son is 5 years old so real
[67:16] still small but yeah passionate about
[67:18] family spending time with my family
[67:20] traveling is also good but I'm probably
[67:22] more passionate about uh reading books
[67:25] and playing drums because I used to play
[67:29] uh drums in a band as well not so much
[67:31] anymore but like I still yeah go down to
[67:36] the basement we have we have a drum kit
[67:37] in the basement and so I play drums what
[67:40] is the most important book that uh you
[67:42] can recommend to to people what they
[67:45] definitely should should read outside of
[67:47] of
[67:48] Bitcoin I think if you're interested in
[67:52] like Central Bank policy monary policy
[67:55] like money in general then you should
[67:57] definitely read princess of the End by
[68:01] Richard ver oh yes uh someone sent me
[68:05] this on a DM I think like two days ago
[68:10] he's like hey you have
[68:11] to who who's the offer yeah who's the
[68:14] offer I think he Rich so he used to be
[68:17] my um PhD supervisor in Southampton used
[68:22] to be my PhD supervisor for six years so
[68:25] I know him very well he I think he lives
[68:28] in Switzerland right now but I'm not
[68:29] sure he's traving traveling a
[68:32] lot but yeah he's professor of MCH
[68:35] economics and yeah and he spents I think
[68:38] more than a decade in Japan also I think
[68:41] he was visiting scholar at the bank of
[68:44] Japan Ministry of Finance in Japan and
[68:47] that's when he
[68:50] actually like witnessed the was probably
[68:54] the biggest like like bubble as Sur
[68:57] prise inflation bubble in the history of
[68:59] mankind
[69:00] right in the Japanese real estate bubble
[69:03] in the 1980s right and so after that
[69:07] Bubble Burst he was around in the 90s so
[69:10] he witness this kind of depression the
[69:13] last decade or was even two L decades in
[69:16] Japan
[69:17] firsthand and that's why he I think
[69:20] that's how he developed this kind of
[69:22] idea to write this
[69:24] book yeah I don't want to spoil anyone I
[69:26] don't to say too much you
[69:29] know yeah it's came up the second time
[69:32] this week I have to research now uh
[69:35] perfect then uh let's uh let's do this
[69:39] end routine of of uh where the previous
[69:41] guest is asking a question for the next
[69:42] guest without knowing who the next guest
[69:44] is and this question for you is how much
[69:46] will a small house in Monaco cost
[69:49] measured in Bitcoin in 10 years um we
[69:53] talked about a lot with the last guest
[69:54] like how real estate is um because the
[69:58] last guest was actually the opinion that
[69:59] real estate uh does not compete with
[70:02] Bitcoin but he changed that opinion in
[70:03] the last like six to eight months uh and
[70:06] he's now seeing a lot of uh even real
[70:08] estate people that like oh I also want
[70:10] to have Bitcoin and Bitcoin kind of
[70:11] sucks up that Financial energy and we
[70:13] have already this kind of slow
[70:16] progression the last five years where
[70:19] five at least like when when Bitcoin
[70:21] started that real estate is getting
[70:23] cheaper and cheaper measured in Bitcoin
[70:26] and right now I saw is like the average
[70:28] price in Monaco for a house or for condo
[70:30] is like 32 Bitcoin um how much is it in
[70:35] Fiat like oh wait uh let's 42
[70:40] Bitcoin let's let's let's see what the f
[70:44] price is 32 Bitcoin are uh 2 million two
[70:51] I've heard there some small more like 5
[70:56] million but
[70:58] yeah interesting yeah yeah let's say 2
[71:02] million right yeah let's see I'd
[71:05] say in 10 years time I'd say two
[71:08] Bitcoins
[71:11] oh then then many more can live in
[71:13] Monaco I think it's quite likely so the
[71:15] reason is if you look at different
[71:17] models so I
[71:19] think in 10 years time so by the time we
[71:22] are in 2034
[71:25] I think at the beginning of next decade
[71:27] so at the beginning of the
[71:29] 2030s will probably already hit 1
[71:32] million per Bitcoin So based on power
[71:35] model and all kinds of different models
[71:37] they imply the same the funny thing is
[71:39] that if we hit 1
[71:42] million in terms of uh price that
[71:45] implies we hit around 26 uh trillion I
[71:50] think US Dollars market cap
[71:54] right yeah
[71:55] 26 which is pro which is the current
[71:59] market cap of all us treasuries and it's
[72:01] significantly higher than all the
[72:04] gold so if we hit 1 million per
[72:08] coin that means we have probably
[72:11] disrupted gold as a reserve asset
[72:14] already and are probably on a good path
[72:18] to disrupt us treasuries as well but of
[72:22] course I mean like because debt is
[72:24] growing so much right now and so you
[72:26] have more and more us
[72:28] treasuries will probably probably take
[72:31] more time you know to like really reach
[72:34] the market cap of us treasuries but I
[72:36] think there's a good chance that by the
[72:39] beginning of next
[72:41] decade Bitcoin will be bitcoin's market
[72:44] cap will be bigger than
[72:46] gold yeah I think we need like
[72:50] 600,000 6 or 700,000 because like more
[72:53] recently the gold price also went up so
[72:55] market cap also went up so we be will be
[72:59] a fun time I I hope I get Peter shift on
[73:02] when when Bitcoin hits that price
[73:04] Target but like yeah to answer the
[73:06] question two Bitcoins I think in Monaco
[73:09] that's really cool uh two Bitcoin uh I
[73:11] love it there's a side priced in uh 21
[73:16] and there you can see like real estate
[73:17] prices uh priced in Bitcoin and
[73:20] everything priced in Bitcoin and it's
[73:22] just uh it's a cool mind switch when you
[73:25] price things in Bitcoin and no longer in
[73:28] in in US Dollars and it makes also
[73:31] expenses like big expenses and um
[73:34] Investments all of the sudden you're
[73:35] like oh do I really want to spend those
[73:37] Bitcoin because exactly uh they are only
[73:40] 21 million like maybe I never get it
[73:42] back maybe tomorrow is is the week where
[73:45] all the 10 days are in a one row and
[73:47] Bitcoin is at like
[73:48] 300,000 like Samson MO is always
