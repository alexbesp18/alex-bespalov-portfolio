[00:00] 80% of your effort should be put into
[00:02] your content if you cannot hook
[00:03] somebody's attention and nobody's going
[00:05] to read your post it's like it's all
[00:06] worthless the more Bitcoin grows the
[00:08] more it undermines the power of the
[00:10] governments Bitcoin takes the money
[00:12] printer away from the government you're
[00:13] saving a money where your time is
[00:16] leaking out you will behave differently
[00:18] bco is a promise of a better
[00:21] world you are the social media leader
[00:23] and realer right yeah but I prefer the
[00:25] title meme
[00:27] Sensei meme Sensei yeah that's that's
[00:31] really really cool how is it to like
[00:33] handle such a big account I think it can
[00:36] be really really hacked at times I know
[00:38] it from from my account that it can be
[00:41] uh really stressful and sometimes
[00:43] disappointing also how is it to uh have
[00:46] such a big account to be the social
[00:47] media lead about it and explain why some
[00:51] posts perform really good and some don't
[00:52] so managing a big account is uh very fun
[00:56] but also not fun just because uh I mean
[01:00] I mean it's fun because there's a lot of
[01:02] content coming way so you you see a lot
[01:05] but then like I used to have this policy
[01:07] where I would reply to everybody who
[01:10] mentions relay like that was my policy
[01:12] but now I maybe reply to like 10% of
[01:15] people because there's just so many
[01:16] people who just tag us so it's there's
[01:19] there's benefits but also it's it's kind
[01:21] of hard did you ask for like tips on how
[01:23] to grow a Twitter account I think I want
[01:26] to go to to that a little bit later um
[01:30] how do you decide to what you reply
[01:32] because actually I'm also right now in
[01:34] the face like I reply to everybody and
[01:37] and now I'm getting to the point where I
[01:39] lag behind sometimes a few hours because
[01:41] I I have to keep up uh and sometimes
[01:44] there like breaks where post perform a
[01:46] little less and then you can keep up
[01:48] with the comments again like how do you
[01:50] decide who are you uh um replying to and
[01:53] who
[01:55] not yeah well first of all the fact that
[01:57] you cannot reply to everybody because of
[01:59] the sheer volume that's a good problem
[02:01] that means you're growing as far like
[02:03] who to reply and what to reply it's kind
[02:05] of
[02:06] like like right right now we we got an
[02:08] intern so Jordan from the relay Squad is
[02:12] a a social media intern and I like I
[02:13] tried to explain to explain to him how
[02:16] we reply on Twitter and to who and it
[02:18] was kind of weird because there's no
[02:20] like handbook on how to like talk to
[02:22] people it's just like just be social and
[02:25] uh don't be an but uh like
[02:27] honestly like some comments they just
[02:30] you know you can just like them it's not
[02:32] realistic to reply to everybody
[02:33] especially when you have 40K followers
[02:35] and everybody wants your attention you
[02:36] just have to pick like like if somebody
[02:40] ask a question definitely answer it but
[02:42] then or if somebody says something and
[02:43] you have a good answer or you know
[02:46] answer them but like you just you just
[02:48] have to always Case by case look uh who
[02:51] to answer and who you can Skip it's just
[02:54] not realistic to answer everybody yeah
[02:56] sometimes Al when you have a Rial tweet
[02:58] where is there's a common theme about it
[03:00] like there's usually uh five different
[03:03] or three different kinds of of replies
[03:05] that come and they come in like all over
[03:07] the B like there there 300 comments and
[03:09] you basically could uh put them in three
[03:11] different categories and all answer them
[03:14] with the same comment uh but uh it's
[03:17] it's it's it's an interesting
[03:19] experience yeah but but when you when
[03:21] you reply to people this is like a lot
[03:23] of a lot what Bitcoin Brands Miss is uh
[03:26] well first of all most Bitcoin Brands
[03:28] don't even reply to people so like they
[03:31] they treat social media as like a
[03:32] broadcast channel where they think they
[03:34] have a microphone and they're talking to
[03:35] an audience whereas if somebody sees a a
[03:38] tweet from a brand a Bitcoin brand to
[03:41] them it's a onetoone conversation so
[03:42] like a lot of Bitcoin Brands forget to
[03:44] be social on social media and if you if
[03:47] you if you take out the social from
[03:49] social media you just have media and it
[03:51] doesn't really work on on social media
[03:54] and like a big part of growing on social
[03:58] media is actually engaging
[04:00] so like you could be you could have the
[04:02] best content and you will grow but I
[04:04] would say 40% of like social media
[04:06] success is actually like behaving like a
[04:09] normal user and talking to people being
[04:12] part of the community I would say 40% of
[04:15] like social media growth is like
[04:16] engaging people and then 60% is like
[04:19] really good content and we can discuss
[04:21] what what I what really good content
[04:23] means for a for a Bitcoin brand yeah
[04:26] let's go right into this uh what how do
[04:29] you decide if a post is good or bad like
[04:32] how how do you come up with ideas how do
[04:34] you decide then if it's a good or bad
[04:37] idea how do you involve the idea in an
[04:40] actual post do you have like a checklist
[04:42] you go through yeah so I mean uh it's
[04:45] like creating content is is like a
[04:48] muscle that you have to practice you
[04:49] know once you've posted 10 10 pieces of
[04:52] content you become a little better and
[04:53] after 100 pieces of content you even
[04:55] better and after 1,000 you're Pro but it
[04:58] all starts with an idea like if your
[05:01] idea is the post is probably going
[05:03] to also be it's like you know
[05:05] there's a saying in Tech that you cannot
[05:08] uh I mean in marketing that you can't
[05:10] like you can't do if you have a shitty
[05:14] product and great marketing you know you
[05:16] have a leaky bucket and you know it's
[05:18] you cannot outm Market a shitty product
[05:20] and it's the same with content like you
[05:22] need to treat content as the main
[05:23] product like when you post on social
[05:25] media as a Bitcoin brand it's not just
[05:27] something you post on the side it is the
[05:30] main product and if the product is bad
[05:33] then it's going to flop so it starts
[05:34] with an idea and then once you have a
[05:36] good idea you can go to the next step
[05:38] which would be then like the hook so
[05:40] like 80% of your effort should be put
[05:42] into your content hook like if nobody if
[05:45] you cannot hook somebody's attention and
[05:47] nobody's going to read your post it's
[05:49] like it's all worthless so I would say
[05:50] like 20% of the effort should be the
[05:53] post the body and then 80% of your
[05:56] effort should be in the hook so the
[05:57] headline something that basically
[05:59] basically gets your attention and like
[06:01] stops the scroll if you earned like
[06:05] basically if you can stop somebody from
[06:07] scrolling then they will read your post
[06:09] and then the last thing would be you
[06:11] need to decide on the medium sorry the
[06:14] format so is it going to be a video is
[06:16] it going to be a thread is it going to
[06:17] be text an image and this depends on the
[06:20] platform you you always need to be like
[06:22] looking what what is the algorithm
[06:24] pushing right now and what is the best
[06:27] way to convey this idea so like if you
[06:29] if you you know if you want to talk
[06:31] about self custody like maybe I mean
[06:33] visual could work but also video videos
[06:36] do really well as opposed to like if you
[06:39] talk about self- custody in a long form
[06:41] text it's kind of dry it can still work
[06:43] but you always need to think like what
[06:45] is the best format to convey this
[06:49] idea but um yeah those would be like my
[06:52] my checklist but uh what was the rest of
[06:55] the question that was basically the the
[06:58] how do you decide if what is a good post
[07:00] and what is a bad post like basically
[07:03] you have you get it like how do you
[07:05] decide is it even in reala is like is
[07:08] there a process involved where you have
[07:09] to be like oh when the post is a good
[07:12] one and I think it's a good one then I
[07:14] give it to someone else to to give it
[07:16] free or is the how is the work process
[07:18] also working yeah so because we're a
[07:19] small team team at relay we're like
[07:22] we're just we're essentially four people
[07:25] in the marketing team so like I create
[07:27] the content and then I send it to myself
[07:29] for approval and then I approve it so
[07:32] like that's the approval flow like if
[07:34] it's good enough for me it's good enough
[07:35] for Relay but uh like like when you it
[07:39] depends if you're posting for like you
[07:41] know personal stuff there's a lot more
[07:43] leeway but when you're posting for brand
[07:45] there's there's a lot more you know
[07:48] there's a you're kind of in a box you
[07:50] have to think like what is allowed but
[07:53] when you're posting for a Bitcoin
[07:54] company it's like the content needs to
[07:57] be something that people like if not if
[07:59] people don't like your content it's it's
[08:01] not good and then you also have to you
[08:04] also have to make sure that content is
[08:05] native so like don't be posting links
[08:07] that drive traffic to other websites
[08:09] because Twitter hates that because
[08:10] Twitter makes money by people endlessly
[08:13] scrolling because that's how they serve
[08:15] ads so the content needs to be good to
[08:18] the end user it needs to be native
[08:20] content and then it also needs to
[08:23] somehow like basically it needs to align
[08:26] with the business goals so like if if
[08:28] for example relay like if our if our
[08:30] goal is to acquire users that want to
[08:32] Stack sets it maybe doesn't make sense
[08:34] to post a video of meet workking on
[08:36] Twitter because even though this might
[08:39] go viral of me shaking my ass but then
[08:42] like it doesn't help the relay business
[08:44] in any way you know what I mean so it
[08:47] needs to satisfy these three things and
[08:49] this is like the trifactor of good
[08:50] content and in the middle if you create
[08:52] content that satisfies all three I would
[08:55] consider that to be good content yeah I
[08:58] think that's the the great Freedom uh
[09:00] people have that post just on their
[09:03] personal stuff because they are the sole
[09:05] decid what their brand the themsel is
[09:09] thinking and if you're thinking
[09:11] something right now and you want to post
[09:12] it that's basically a part of you and
[09:14] you can just post it but if you're
[09:16] working for a Bitcoin brand you always
[09:18] have to see the whole picture the bigger
[09:21] picture I guess yeah very much like
[09:23] posting on social media is very much
[09:25] like it's all about branding so like
[09:27] social media is not a great sales
[09:28] Channel and there's some companies who
[09:30] are really salesy on social media and it
[09:32] doesn't really work because nobody likes
[09:34] to be sold to when people see when
[09:36] people see an ad they immediately know
[09:38] this is an ad somebody's trying to sell
[09:39] me I don't like this but like you know
[09:42] like good content is is supposed to be
[09:44] always offering some kind of value you
[09:48] know if the content is not valuable it
[09:50] doesn't add value to your followers you
[09:52] shouldn't you probably shouldn't be
[09:53] posting it and value can be many things
[09:56] it can be humor it can be inspiration
[09:59] or like ins something inspiring or
[10:02] something super bullish so like every
[10:04] time you post something you're speaking
[10:05] to people and you want to inv evoke some
[10:09] kind of emotion like the worst thing is
[10:11] if if people see your content and they
[10:13] don't think anything that's that's the
[10:15] worst thing when people feel indifferent
[10:17] about you so I'd rather have people
[10:19] hating on my content because at least
[10:21] that helps the algorithm and they're
[10:22] feeling something like of course the
[10:24] best thing is that if people love my
[10:26] content and they're supportive but I
[10:27] rather choose those two than be in the
[10:29] Middle where nobody nobody hates you and
[10:32] nobody loves you and you're just
[10:34] indifferent and but at the end of the
[10:36] day you're talking to people and you
[10:38] just kind of you just need to have some
[10:40] like people skills and understand like
[10:43] what drives them also you have to really
[10:44] deeply understand the people you're
[10:46] talking to which is easy for me because
[10:47] I talk to bitcoiners and I am a
[10:49] bitcoiner so it works out yeah I I
[10:53] discovered uh on my personal account
[10:55] that the best content is where you have
[10:59] an emotional reaction from a positive
[11:02] emotional reaction of one group and a
[11:04] negative positive negative emotional
[11:06] reaction of another group at the same
[11:08] time where like if you post something
[11:10] about Al coins uh it sometimes did
[11:14] really really good because I just had
[11:16] like one position and the bitcoiners
[11:18] jumped in and uh wanted to make the the
[11:21]  coiners in the post uh look like
[11:23]  shiters jumped in and like the this
[11:26] is I think the the best case scenario
[11:29] and the worst case as you described is
[11:31] when nobody cares for the content
[11:33] anyways and I think yeah I mean for me
[11:37] it was like I just tweeted out so much I
[11:40] did it with pure quantity that my brain
[11:43] I think with time was getting trained uh
[11:47] what works and what not so I think
[11:49] quantity is if you can just do it uh
[11:53] also big quality driver over the long
[11:55] time because you just get drained on
[11:57] what works and what not because of and
[11:59] era uh I guess for company it's
[12:03] different there's like there's some
[12:05] fundamentals to marketing of course
[12:07] because marketing is psychology you know
[12:10] uh human
[12:13] behavior but like when it comes to
[12:15] social media specifically there is no
[12:17] there's no fundamentals you just you
[12:19] just have to try and see what sticks
[12:21] like you just have to have you just have
[12:23] to try everything and then when you find
[12:25] the winning formula something that works
[12:27] and people really like then you just
[12:29] double down on it and kind of like do it
[12:31] until it doesn't work anymore how did
[12:34] you uh learn all this that you had a job
[12:37] before in social media did you just
[12:39] learn it on the go or did you learn it
[12:41] in on the internet with YouTube itself
[12:43] and doing it on for
[12:46] yourself yeah so I don't have a I don't
[12:48] have any marketing degree of course I
[12:49] did study marketing to some extent was
[12:51] part of my degree which is with business
[12:53] administration but I I never had any
[12:56] like specific marketing experience and I
[12:58] never had a marketing job before joining
[12:59] relay but I've always uh I've never
[13:03] worked for a company where I wasn't a
[13:05] user first you know and uh I was a user
[13:09] of
[13:10] relay and uh I really like the product
[13:13] and I heard Julian on Daniel prin
[13:15] podcast and it really convinced me like
[13:17] I thought that this is like a very good
[13:19] product and I should be helping them so
[13:21] I just essentially I just messaged him
[13:23] on Telegram and uh long story short I
[13:26] just harassed him until he gave a
[13:29] parttime job first he refused me because
[13:31] I don't speak
[13:32] German uh but then but then I was I
[13:35] think I was providing so much value to
[13:36] him and just giving giving giving and
[13:39] not asking anything back that he
[13:41] eventually agreed to hire me part-time
[13:43] and then uh just because I again I was
[13:46] so driven I got I was hired full-time
[13:49] and where I learned all of this is
[13:50] basically through work so like I have
[13:53] great colleagues who I I I learned a lot
[13:54] also from my boss emo but also like just
[13:57] by doing trial and error you learn so
[13:59] much also I consume like marketing
[14:02] related content
[14:03] podcasts so I'm just uh and I think I'm
[14:07] lucky because I'm really curious un like
[14:09] a sponge I I like learning so it's been
[14:12] easy for me but like
[14:15] definitely uh definitely I wish I knew
[14:18] more when I started and that's why like
[14:20] now I've started creating more content
[14:22] also about like how to do marketing
[14:24] especially in Bitcoin land to help
[14:26] people kind of like give them shortcut
[14:29] so they they don't have to go they don't
[14:30] have to like just like learn this in
[14:34] three years maybe they can like learn it
[14:36] in I don't know six months I like that
[14:39] you harassed Julian into a parttime
[14:42] job what like can you go into it what
[14:47] value did you provide to him that he
[14:49] finally says oh yes let's let's hire
[14:52] hire
[14:52] ason yeah so essentially I was just
[14:54] sending him and uh the CMO of relay at
[14:57] the time I was was just sending them
[14:59] post ideas of like guys uh here's like
[15:02] 10 post ideas please post them they
[15:05] they're yours uh and uh then I just kept
[15:08] sending post ideas of course lots of
[15:11] memes and uh like and it really helped
[15:14] them and they saw that the posts
[15:16] performed really well and also I had
[15:18] some proof of work under my belt so of
[15:19] course I wasn't like like a known person
[15:23] who knows what I'm talking about um but
[15:26] like they saw that I can I I I my
[15:28] personal account to like maybe 5,000
[15:31] followers which is not much but but
[15:33] still so they they're already like that
[15:35] was kind of like my proof of work online
[15:37] portfolio so I I kept adding value I
[15:40] kept sending them post ideas and then
[15:42] they also saw that okay this guy has
[15:44] already done it he can do it for us too
[15:46] so that's why I always recommend and I'm
[15:48] actually going to be publishing an
[15:49] article on uh in February uh with a few
[15:53] other bitcoiners of how how to get a
[15:55] Bitcoin job and a big part of that is
[15:58] you need to you have an online portfolio
[15:59] which we call the proof of work so like
[16:02] you need to build in public you so that
[16:04] when employers come to you they see who
[16:07] you are immediately and like when they
[16:09] go to your Twitter it access your CV
[16:11] they see immediately what you're all
[16:12] about and uh like there's a saying don't
[16:15] trust verify in Bitcoin which is great
[16:19] but like when it comes to people we
[16:20] still need a lot of trust and we we
[16:23] cannot verify everything but the fact
[16:25] but the fact that we have we're building
[16:27] in public like a proof of work portfolio
[16:29] it helps them really to verify that
[16:31] you're the real deal I mean I think this
[16:33] is a general really really good advice
[16:35] not only in Bitcoin uh in in general
[16:38] life when you go to a company and you're
[16:42] doing the things that the company doing
[16:44] on your own channel and you grew it over
[16:47] years and they see you have done the
[16:50] work even though they didn't ask for
[16:52] that and the CEO he actually proved it
[16:55] like that's a that's no-brainer to do
[16:57] and it's it's a good combination yeah
[16:58] but nobody
[17:00] does you know maybe maybe maybe in
[17:02] Germany where you're from it's a bit
[17:04] different I know in America there is a
[17:05] bit of a hustle like in Europe like
[17:09] nobody does anything if you don't pay
[17:11] them like there is no like nobody's like
[17:14] trying that hard even less like I think
[17:16] people not even not doing uh only work
[17:20] when they paid for they're even doing
[17:23] only the the way that the the minimum
[17:26] amount of work so they just don't get
[17:28] fired I think I I see a lot in companies
[17:33] where they are like just doing a bare
[17:34] minimum so they can so they're not
[17:37] getting kicked out like that's even less
[17:38] than just doing the work they're getting
[17:40] paid for I think well that's why I like
[17:43] working in a startup because if you do
[17:45] bare minimum in startup you're going to
[17:46] get kicked out really quick people are
[17:48] going to see that you're not
[17:49] contributing so that's also like you
[17:52] know that's why I prefer working for
[17:53] Relay because we're a small team what
[17:57] did you be do before reala and and did
[18:00] you you obviously were in in Bitcoin
[18:02] before reala uh and like how did you
[18:05] discover Bitcoin and what did you do
[18:07] around that time and before really so I
[18:09] discovered Bitcoin before I had any job
[18:11] so I was in
[18:12] college um uh so how I discover Bitcoin
[18:18] is it's a pretty standard story it's
[18:20] basically you hear about the massive
[18:22] gains that people make and then you also
[18:25] want to make the gains and then you
[18:26] happen to buy the absolute top of 2017
[18:30] po Market
[18:32] 20K and uh then you essentially write it
[18:34] all the way down to
[18:36] 3K and uh you have a lot of time to
[18:39] contemplate what what did you just do
[18:41] like did I just waste all my money and
[18:43] that's when I had lots of time to do
[18:45] some self reflecting and studying so
[18:48] obviously that that's when I uh went
[18:51] into Bitcoin
[18:53] only uh that's when I really sharpened
[18:55] my skills and knowledge that's also when
[18:57] I started like stacking s sets
[19:00] religiously and to to this day I stack
[19:04] sets uh so pretty standard Rabbit Hole
[19:06] Journey so like stayed for the you know
[19:08] came for the money stayed for the tech
[19:10] and before relay I worked in a bank so I
[19:13] did uh customer care
[19:15] there um so that was also fun because uh
[19:19] officially we were not allowed to own
[19:21] any Bitcoin that was like the bank rule
[19:23] but you know of course because
[19:26] their stupid rules I still stack out
[19:28] every week while working at this bank
[19:31] and after that I worked at Ledger for uh
[19:33] nine months doing also like technical
[19:35] writing and customer support and then
[19:37] you switched from ledger to relay
[19:40] directly yeah so Ledger is a it's a
[19:42] crypto company so they deal with
[19:44] shitcoins and just with my you know I
[19:47] just my my interest at that point had
[19:49] shifted and I was not really I was like
[19:53] kind of disgusted with kinds so I I
[19:57] I just couldn't keep keep working there
[19:59] and uh then I found relay and uh there's
[20:01] not that many Bitcoin only companies
[20:03] there's more and more now but like 20189
[20:07] it was really like weird to be just
[20:11] Bitcoin only it didn't make sense like
[20:12] why would you just do Bitcoin only when
[20:14] you can do all these other things so
[20:16] like now like like I'm I'm really happy
[20:19] at relay and uh I don't see myself doing
[20:22] anything for like crypto companies just
[20:24] because I I I don't believe in it you
[20:26] know I did you find that like passion
[20:29] for like Bitcoin only a lot of people
[20:32] are seduced by this uh shitcoin area as
[20:35] I say like it's almost like a casino uh
[20:38] you know that you probably lose money uh
[20:40] but you hope for the big wins you hope
[20:43] for it like I hear a lot of people
[20:46] especially in my friend Circle that are
[20:48] not on the the Bitcoin Twitter uh they
[20:51] are like yeah but I I gamble just like
[20:54] 10% Like 5% of my money in the
[20:58] coins and one hopefully shoots up and
[20:59] then I convert to bitcoin I hear that a
[21:02] lot still how did you make this jump
[21:05] from knowing this is and this is
[21:09] Bitcoin and I only want to do Bitcoin
[21:11] and not the yeah I think all of us
[21:14] have this inner degenerate inside of us
[21:17] who just wants to gamble a little bit
[21:19] and
[21:21] um I mean I think it's it's part of most
[21:25] of us do come from the shitcoin route
[21:28] and end up in Bitcoin only just because
[21:30] we've seen what happens in crypto and we
[21:33] like I don't know like maybe we're just
[21:35] like have so high integrity that we see
[21:37] it and we just you know like I can't be
[21:39] part of this because you do see how the
[21:41] pump and dumps schemes work how the VC's
[21:43] dump on retail like it's all in the open
[21:46] and uh most people in crypto like
[21:49] there's some people who don't know about
[21:50] this but there's also people who know
[21:51] and don't care and don't care and uh
[21:54] it's just not something it's just not
[21:56] something a normal person person would
[21:58] want to do right if you know there's so
[22:00] so much Shenanigans going on but uh yeah
[22:03] I had a lot of studying to do in my
[22:06] shitcoin phase I also got burned a few
[22:08] times with some uh you know buying some
[22:10] coins like I I had like every single
[22:13] coin shitcoin Under the Sun now I just
[22:15] have Bitcoin only so but it took me
[22:18] probably like one year to just really
[22:20] like educate myself on you know what
[22:23] what this revolution is really about
[22:25] it's it's really about fixing money and
[22:28] the rest of the stuff that's built on
[22:29] the side in the crypto land arguably
[22:31] mostly the only use case is making the
[22:34] founders rich not a lot of utility there
[22:38] that's the I think this the the best use
[22:40] case and I will say on on my Twitter
[22:43] that bit that shitcoins or altcoins
[22:46] don't have any use cases but some reply
[22:49] yeah they're making at least the
[22:50] founders Rich the use case for altcoins
[22:53] is to for the founders to get your
[22:56] Bitcoin like at the the end of the day
[22:58] the founders they want Bitcoin and even
[23:01] shitcoins I don't know that many
[23:03] shitcoins who are 100% shitcoins every
[23:06]  coiner has also a Bitcoin stack
[23:08] because everybody knows that Bitcoin is
[23:10] the real deal so the use case for
[23:12] altcoins is to take your Bitcoin but
[23:14] like I would have no problem if if the
[23:16] crypto marketing would be like honest if
[23:19] they just said that this is this is just
[23:20] a casino and it's super risky and we're
[23:23] just gambling and we have no idea what
[23:24] we're doing I'll be totally fine because
[23:26] that's essentially what a casin is and I
[23:29] have no issue with people gambling but
[23:30] because they do Affinity scamming and
[23:32] they you know they kind of you know
[23:35] they're I mean they're unregistered
[23:37] Securities and they essentially kind of
[23:41] Promise some kind of return and it's
[23:43] just like if the marketing was honest I
[23:45] would have no issue with crypto people
[23:46] could do whatever they want with their
[23:47] money but because they're selling pipe
[23:50] dreams you know that's when we have to
[23:52] call them out I I always get frustrated
[23:54] when I talk about altcoins and and and
[23:56] and coin and how how big they still
[23:59] are because I think they are pretty big
[24:01] for what they are still and it's just
[24:04] marketing it's just gambling it's just
[24:07] uh people are taking other people's
[24:10] Bitcoin I always say money but you are
[24:13] right I actually they it should be like
[24:15] they're just taking Bitcoin so you went
[24:18] go ahead well no I just wanted to say
[24:19] that like every time there's new
[24:20] technology you can expect there to be
[24:23] also opportunists there's people who are
[24:25] building but there's also going to be
[24:27] opportunists who just capitalize on
[24:29] every new wave and it's the same with
[24:31] Bitcoin AI internet there's always going
[24:33] to be people who will capitalize and uh
[24:36] you know not building anything useful
[24:39] but they know that there's a lot of hype
[24:41] and money slushing around in this new
[24:43] industry and they just capitalize it
[24:46] yeah it's kind of like the bubble in
[24:48] 2000 where so many internet companies
[24:51] were around and Ju Just everyone got
[24:54] money uh for basically just having an
[24:57] idea that's not good at all and then
[25:00] yeah there's a big Clash coming and only
[25:03] the big ones and the good ones actually
[25:05] came through with like apple Microsoft
[25:08] uh and um yeah Amazon I also think was
[25:11] around back then so it was like maybe
[25:13] like four companies made it really
[25:15] through through that whole phase and the
[25:17] rest of the thousands of companies just
[25:19] went bankrupt and or got absorbed by one
[25:22] of the bigger ones so I think this is
[25:24] also something that happens with Bitcoin
[25:27] but
[25:28] just on a way bigger scale because for
[25:31] me it's just Bitcoin it's not as some
[25:34] say oh it's Bitcoin ethereum maybe a
[25:36] third one will be sticking around like I
[25:39] heard this saying it's Bitcoin it's for
[25:41] sound money then it's ethereum for
[25:43] platforms and then there's a place for
[25:45] mcoin I'm like no it's Bitcoin sorry to
[25:48] say it's like uh like my question is
[25:50] always like to etherum people why do you
[25:52] need censorship resistance resistance
[25:55] like like blockchain is extremely
[25:59] like ineffective way of organizing data
[26:02] and you only need it if you need
[26:05] sensorship resistance which is like
[26:07] basically just money like I can't think
[26:10] of any other use case where you could
[26:12] where you would need it like maybe maybe
[26:14] like voting on blockchain maybe that
[26:16] could make sense but like building
[26:18] crypto kitties like do they really need
[26:21] to be censorship resistant like dick
[26:23] butts on the on the blockchain I don't
[26:26] think so I even had a good friend of
[26:28] mine who uh built something for that and
[26:31] luckily he uh switched and he's now
[26:34] doing something really cool and but he
[26:37] had a phase where he actually uh
[26:40] launched nft project with uh basically
[26:44] something like that um how do you see
[26:46] the like the Bitcoin adoption going and
[26:48] then the next like five 10 years uh in
[26:51] like absorbing altcoins in absorbing
[26:55] nation states they adopting as following
[26:58] the El Salvador role model uh
[27:01] institutions coming in the Bitcoin ETF
[27:03] there's so much going on how do you see
[27:05] like the adoption coming and what's
[27:08] coming for Bitcoin in the next like five
[27:09] 10 years that's a big question but I
[27:12] don't like making predictions but what I
[27:14] do know for sure is that Fiat money is
[27:18] going to keep the value devaluing like
[27:21] this is a train that cannot be stopped I
[27:24] think we both agree on that and as long
[27:26] as Fiat money keeps self-destructing and
[27:28] essentially going to zero slowly but
[27:31] surely like Bitcoin is going to be
[27:33] growing in popularity because people are
[27:36] waking up and they're asking questions
[27:38] like why is this getting more expensive
[27:40] why am I priced out of my dream home
[27:42] where my parents got this home and now
[27:44] they have two cars and I don't like I
[27:45] can't afford anything so people are
[27:47] asking already questions like last year
[27:49] we had 10% inflation in the EUR Zone and
[27:53] um as time progresses like Fiat money is
[27:57] program Grand to die Fiat money is an
[28:00] experiment like for for for centuries
[28:03] we've used hard money like gold this is
[28:05] the normal and Bitcoin is basically it's
[28:07] just going back to the normal and Fiat
[28:10] is the anomaly and as long as Fiat money
[28:12] keeps just slowly but surely dying
[28:16] Bitcoin is going to be successful I
[28:18] don't know how what the future looks
[28:19] like in five or 10 years but I'm pretty
[28:22] sure that Bitcoin is going to be a big
[28:23] part of that I'm super excited to
[28:26] announce that this podcast just got the
[28:29] first ever sponsor I just started the
[28:33] podcast out like three months ago and
[28:35] now we have 21 Bitcoin as a partner for
[28:39] this podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[28:43] from day one and they teach and preach
[28:46] self custody this is my goto exchange
[28:51] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[28:53] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[28:56] entry for
[28:58] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[29:00] Plus at the same time support this
[29:03] podcast use code Robin and click the
[29:06] link in the description yeah and it's uh
[29:09] I also like that feat will go to zero
[29:12] like eventually I have very very few
[29:15] guests on that say differently some
[29:18] think they it will stickle around always
[29:21] when government's Clinging On on the
[29:23] power it will be just like a small part
[29:25] of it uh it's said I kind of disagree
[29:28] with that because I think it's it's you
[29:30] can just see the trend so so uh clearly
[29:34] and the history teaches us that like
[29:36] soft money is not going to stick around
[29:38] forever maybe it takes 50 years 20 years
[29:42] 10 years 100 years I don't know the
[29:44] timing is difficult to predict but it
[29:46] will happen yeah there's always there's
[29:50] like if there's an incentive to devalue
[29:52] the money you know for the Insiders to
[29:54] devalue the money they're always going
[29:56] to do it like if if if you can do
[30:00] something bad there's going to be people
[30:02] who do it and Bitcoin basically is a
[30:04] system where you cannot cheat it's like
[30:06] in the Roman times when you know they
[30:08] CLI the coins they took small piece of
[30:10] the coin and that was like obviously
[30:12] only the emperor could do that because
[30:14] he was the the law and that was
[30:16] essentially like a tax on your savings
[30:20] and uh he can do it and it's the same
[30:22] with modern modern like governments and
[30:23] central banks like if they can do it if
[30:26] they can inflate your money away they
[30:28] will that's just like it's not it's
[30:31] that's just how the game is played
[30:34] that's just the design of the system
[30:37] yeah once you understand Fiat money it's
[30:39] really easy to understand um maybe
[30:42] talking about Fe and Fiat and Bitcoin
[30:46] you worked in a bank before you worked
[30:47] in a crypto company before really what
[30:50] is like the cultural difference you see
[30:53] between bitcoiners and the Bitcoin
[30:55] company and the feeld uh world and the
[30:59] crypto world where there is a little bit
[31:01] Bitcoin in there but I don't know I
[31:03] would I would not say Leger is a Bitcoin
[31:05] company but how is the the difference
[31:08] going on the crypto field and Bitcoin
[31:11] worlds yeah so I mean it also depends
[31:13] every company I worked for was in a
[31:15] different country so like the you know
[31:17] the crypto company I worked for was a
[31:20] French company so you get the French
[31:21] work culture which is you know French
[31:24] they they love working and they're super
[31:27] flexible that's that's sarcasm uh but uh
[31:32] but like I would say in the in the
[31:34] crypto company definitely there was like
[31:37] of course every company is for profit we
[31:39] all trying to make
[31:41] money but then like at some point you
[31:44] have to
[31:45] ask like when is it enough like if
[31:51] because if you list every shitcoin on
[31:53] your platform in or in your Hardware
[31:55] wallet like of course you make a lot of
[31:57] money and that's what you know that's
[31:58] why letter is so big but then
[32:02] like can you sleep at night that's
[32:05] essentially the question like there's
[32:07] some people who believe in all that and
[32:09] there's gamblers who love gambling but
[32:11] there's also people who just you know
[32:14] it's they just don't care and like being
[32:16] Bitcoin only is there is like ideology
[32:20] that's that's one part of it but also
[32:22] it's a long-term play like we know
[32:24] Bitcoin is here to stay but you can't
[32:26] say the same for all the other shitcoins
[32:29] like it's it's a it's a very shortterm
[32:31] play and I think it's going to bite
[32:34] crypto companies in the ass because
[32:35] their brand is going to be damaged you
[32:38] know you know I would not trust any
[32:40] crypto company you know to deal with my
[32:43] money just because there's like there's
[32:46] so much more attack surface when you
[32:47] deal with crypto and when it comes to
[32:50] Fiat it's just you
[32:52] know I mean the Fiat land it's like
[32:56] nobody thinks
[32:57] nobody questions anything I had to deal
[32:59] with a lot of kyc cases and AML and
[33:02] basically learned that kyc is super
[33:05] useless and like we didn't catch any
[33:07] criminals by doing kyc we just we just
[33:10] closed bank accounts of old women who
[33:13] just failed to do their kyc because they
[33:15] don't use their mobile they don't get
[33:17] the notifications so those are the only
[33:19] criminals we C so kyc is definitely very
[33:23] useless and it's
[33:25] mostly it's basically
[33:28] I think it's for the police state to
[33:31] kind of
[33:32] extend like their oversight to also
[33:35] banking institutions like banking
[33:37] institutions are supposed to take care
[33:38] of your money they're not supposed to
[33:41] like kyc was never a thing like before I
[33:43] don't know 60s 50s but now they're like
[33:47] acting banks are also acting as like a
[33:49] government
[33:51] arm and that's that's that's that's a
[33:54] dangerous Trend and uh like all
[33:56] Financial in institions have to do kyc
[33:58] but I've seen from the inside that it
[34:00] doesn't work it's it's really useless
[34:03] how do you see uh governments and
[34:06] Bitcoin because I think Bitcoin is
[34:08] basically undermining a lot of what
[34:11] governments are doing they need money
[34:14] printing to fund so much stuff if they
[34:17] don't have the money printer and they
[34:20] actually just cannot do it or can do it
[34:22] only on a little small basis because
[34:25] they know it just gets devalued and
[34:27] everybody is jumping on bitcoin how will
[34:30] Bitcoin change governments and the whole
[34:33] political scene so right now we're early
[34:35] so we're lucky so most most politicians
[34:37] and governments don't like pay attention
[34:41] but you are right like the more Bitcoin
[34:43] grows the more it undermines the power
[34:46] of the governments and there are some
[34:48] bitcoiners who are kind of like like I
[34:51] don't know how they identify but
[34:52] definitely socialists where they do
[34:54] believe in like centrally planned like
[34:56] government uh social programs and to me
[35:00] this is like I don't know how how you
[35:02] can come to the conclusion that uh like
[35:05] you know big government can exist with
[35:07] Bitcoin because like it literally
[35:09] Bitcoin takes the money printer away
[35:11] from the governments now I do think in
[35:13] the future it's going to be a lot more
[35:15] voluntary so I think we might see a
[35:17] future where there's a lot more
[35:18] governments but they're smaller and
[35:20] they're voluntary so they're actually
[35:22] like a uh you know competing like in the
[35:25] market for you as a citizen for tax
[35:27] money you know they have packages and
[35:28] they're like okay here's our package
[35:30] here's what we offer here's the tax rate
[35:31] and you get you know you get the RS you
[35:33] get the police and you get this and that
[35:35] and then citizens can basically shop
[35:37] around oh yeah I want to choose uh this
[35:39] like government or um because like I
[35:43] think people always there's always going
[35:45] to be social hierarchy and people always
[35:47] organize themselves into groups we've
[35:48] always done it like people cannot
[35:51] survive alone but the difference is that
[35:53] like it can be voluntary like as opposed
[35:56] to now now where like if you don't like
[35:58] your government you don't like the
[35:59] package that you're getting as a citizen
[36:01] and you don't like the price you're
[36:02] paying for this package like sorry it's
[36:05] it's a monopoly you either you accept it
[36:08] or you go to
[36:09] jail yeah I mean uh in some part you
[36:13] have to the chance to move out but
[36:15] that's hard and even like for the US
[36:18] like there's actually an exit tax and
[36:21] they're even taxing you if you're
[36:23] somewhere outside of the US so like it's
[36:25] it's it's it's hard to to to get out and
[36:28] and just say no to it and I think also
[36:30] that as you said it will be more like a
[36:33] service deal and this is a theme that I
[36:35] hear about in in the Bitcoin scene more
[36:37] and more that governments should be
[36:40] volunteer and if they provide a good
[36:42] service that people like they will get
[36:45] paid for it as normal
[36:47] companies yeah it's like if you're
[36:49] hiring a cleaning service like that
[36:51] you're going to go shop around and get
[36:53] look for the best deal you know you're
[36:55] going to compare the prices you're going
[36:57] to compare the offering but you know for
[37:00] some reason we think that like something
[37:02] like roads or
[37:04] Healthcare cannot like free market
[37:06] cannot take care of a road like
[37:09] we cannot build roads and somehow
[37:11] organize you know the ownership around
[37:14] that now like of course there's going to
[37:17] be unfortunate people and and that's not
[37:21] something like I have a solution for
[37:23] but I think I think in the future it's
[37:27] definitely going to be a lot more like
[37:29] voluntary where you can actually shop
[37:31] around and choose your like you know
[37:34] your government yeah that's uh that's a
[37:36] great great great way to look at it um
[37:39] you also have and I really wanted to
[37:41] mention that you also have a newsleter
[37:43] with one of my favorite Twitter accounts
[37:45] together the Bitcoin therapist I think
[37:48] uh you're doing it together
[37:50] right yeah so the Bitcoin therapist is
[37:52] my partner we write the newsletter
[37:55] together so uh and yeah I started it
[37:58] last year it's basically the newsletter
[38:01] that I would want to read as a bitcoiner
[38:04] especially like two years ago when my
[38:05] knowledge wasn't really really there so
[38:08] I think the issue with a lot of Bitcoin
[38:10] content is that it's dry or
[38:13] technical uh or just too long so what I
[38:18] really want to do is kind of like
[38:20] distill this like it's there so it's
[38:23] like a news format you get three three
[38:25] stories per week but there's also like
[38:26] and there's a lot of humor and kind of
[38:29] like you can see my personality in the
[38:30] writing so it's not dry and it's easy to
[38:32] read it's like I always think that like
[38:35] super simple sentences like if if a
[38:37] sentence is like longer than I don't
[38:39] know like 20 words I immediately like
[38:41] cut it into two so like I keep it super
[38:42] simple and approachable but also I
[38:44] always try to plant like seeds of
[38:46] knowledge into the content uh but also
[38:49] it's it's like I do it for selfish
[38:51] reasons like I obviously like I really
[38:53] like writing it I also want to improve
[38:56] as a wrer writer I think
[38:57] it's I think writing is essentially is
[39:01] communication and it's like one of those
[39:02] sof soft skills that once you like learn
[39:05] you know how to communicate effectively
[39:08] it's it's a super transferable skill and
[39:11] uh it's not like like the the fact that
[39:13] I'm spending like a lot of time writing
[39:14] it it's not going to be waste because I
[39:16] will have all this knowledge so and like
[39:19] I could have written weekly for myself
[39:22] but then I'm sure I would have skipped
[39:24] some weeks because there's nobody to
[39:25] keep me accountable there's nobody
[39:27] reading I would just be like ah it's
[39:28] okay I can skip this week but now that I
[39:30] have
[39:31] readers I cannot skip so readers
[39:34] definitely keep me accountable yeah and
[39:36] you and I think you would put more
[39:38] efforts in when other people see it uh
[39:41] in contrast you just do it for yourself
[39:44] I I always try to do do everything as
[39:47] public as I can uh this is kind of also
[39:51] the the podcast started out like that
[39:54] because uh I started last year in
[39:57] January with my Twitter and then more
[39:59] and more it grew and then uh people
[40:02] reached out to me I reached out to
[40:03] people and we just talked online not
[40:06] recorded just online talking to pit
[40:08] corners and then I was like I want to do
[40:10] that more how do I force myself to do
[40:13] that more it's a podcast and now I
[40:15] record every day January I had every day
[40:18] recording like one or two days where the
[40:20] the G can and I'm already booked out
[40:23] till like February 27 or something like
[40:26] that on today is like not even February
[40:28] it's 31st of January because I want to
[40:30] force myself to record as many uh
[40:33] episodes as possible I also want to grow
[40:36] the podcast to get a really cool guests
[40:38] on and if you're forced to do it you're
[40:41] so much more motivated and do it
[40:44] publicly you also get the feedback from
[40:46] the people this is something you might
[40:49] also experience like you get so much
[40:51] feedback probably from people that read
[40:53] the newsletter how is that going yeah I
[40:56] always have a I have a poll at the end
[40:58] of every newsletter so there's basically
[41:00] three options like one is like super
[41:02] awesome and the second is like uh do
[41:04] better and the third one is like this is
[41:06]  please uh you know quit and uh like
[41:10] I always monitor that and uh it's good
[41:14] to get instant feedback but sometimes it
[41:16] can be discouraging even like one bad
[41:19] comment it's like it's it's it's
[41:20] discouraging but like it's it's just
[41:23] you're you you learn to like take it in
[41:25] criticism and uh especially in my job
[41:27] like when you work in social media
[41:28] especially with bitcoiners who can be
[41:30] like sometimes and like I'm an
[41:33]  too especially when it comes to
[41:35] debating uh coiners like you get a
[41:38] thicker schin so like for example I I'm
[41:41] learning French right now and I moved I
[41:43] moved to France without speaking any
[41:45] french so this I put myself in a very
[41:47] uncomfortable situation but I have no
[41:49] regrets because this really forced me to
[41:51] learn French and I don't have perfect
[41:53] French far from it but I learned so much
[41:56] faster as opposed to if I stayed in my
[41:58] home country and just played some
[42:00] dualingo like I I not like I I was
[42:04] placed in this place and uh basically
[42:06] like forced to speak to people and like
[42:08] your learning curve is so much steeper
[42:11] and it's the same with you like you're
[42:13] not going to regret doing this podcast
[42:15] 100% yeah um maybe now uh even the the
[42:20] end routine I think the the question
[42:22] from the end routine we have end routine
[42:24] the previous guest asked a question for
[42:25] the next
[42:27] uh really is kind of not Bitcoin
[42:30] question but it suits the topic really
[42:33] well what activity or what what do you
[42:36] do in general uh to be most productive
[42:40] to be able to do all the stuff you're
[42:42] doing right now whose question is this
[42:43] it comes from uh the Bitcoin bin uh uh
[42:48] guys the Charlie from Charlie from
[42:51] Bitcoin bin the like Bitcoin bin you
[42:54] know the
[42:57] no no the
[42:59] the El Salvador the place in El
[43:03] Salvador uh there's a a place place
[43:06] called berin like the Germany that like
[43:09] it's also there in in El Salvador and
[43:11] they're trying to make a Bitcoin City
[43:14] and there is the project Bitcoin Berlin
[43:16] I think you you should definitely check
[43:18] it out there's a Cool vibe going on
[43:20] there yeah and uh there there are like
[43:24] two guys uh who no like a couple that
[43:28] like an romantic couple that founded
[43:30] that whole thing and they just started
[43:32] out and moving to Berlin like in El
[43:34] Salvador and they basically orange build
[43:38] merchants and now you can basically pay
[43:41] everywhere with with with Bitcoin almost
[43:43] everywhere I think there are over 100
[43:44] merchants and it's a small small town uh
[43:48] and I think they are getting bigger and
[43:50] one of the the team members there is
[43:53] like Charlie and he's really big on Aon
[43:56] omics a really bright mind also and and
[43:58] he asked that question like I think he
[44:00] said like something like oh what do you
[44:01] do to be in Flow State to be most
[44:03] productive something like that so what
[44:06] do I do to stay productive and healthy
[44:09] is like of course like you have to do
[44:11] sports like Bitcoin teaches you
[44:14] long-term thinking that's where we're
[44:16] all stacking STS we're stacking stats
[44:17] for the long term and um it's the same
[44:22] with like your body like at the end of
[44:24] the day you only have your body you can
[44:26] lose if you don't have your body you
[44:28] can't enjoy anything if you lose your
[44:30] body so at the end of the day the only
[44:32] thing you really own is your body you
[44:34] need to have a long-term mindset so
[44:36] that's why
[44:37] like like I I I go to the gym so I have
[44:39] a home gym right upstairs above this
[44:42] room and uh like I like working out so
[44:45] I'm lucky in that sense and uh everybody
[44:47] should find the the way that they a
[44:48] sport that they like whether it's
[44:50] running playing pickle ball or or
[44:53] gym I don't even think of it as like
[44:56] okay like I'm I'm feeling like working
[44:59] out it's just like it's like stacking
[45:00] sets I just do it three times a week
[45:02] because this is a long-term investment
[45:04] into myself and U you know hopefully
[45:07] also like my kids so they can enjoy me
[45:10] and I'm not an old man who you know
[45:12] can't can't chase a football but uh
[45:15] that's physical but then also you have
[45:17] to it's easy to be obsessed with Bitcoin
[45:20] but sometimes you have to look out and
[45:22] you have to you know you have to watch
[45:24] some Netflix you have to you know
[45:26] maintain relationships which is reallyy
[45:29] easy to lose especially once you go down
[45:31] the rabbit hole because your your brain
[45:33] expands so much and then when you talk
[45:35] to your old friends who are still in the
[45:37] Old State there's a bit of a disconnect
[45:40] and you can't relate anymore but you
[45:42] know uh still it's really important to
[45:45] maintain like other
[45:47] relationships and uh yeah uh get a
[45:50] girlfriend they're those are
[45:54] nice uh I mean that that topic is
[45:57] actually really interesting because I
[45:59] was uh long of the opinion that the
[46:01] girlfriend is a Time killer uh and I got
[46:06] my current girlfriend over a year ago
[46:09] now uh and uh it it gives me so much
[46:13] energy and allows me to be so much more
[46:16] productive uh in a day it's it's amazing
[46:20] just from my personal experience I can
[46:22] can tell that a girlfriend is one hell
[46:25] of a life pack uh for me uh but I had
[46:29] just two interesting way to say don't
[46:32] tell your girlfriend that you say she's
[46:34] a life
[46:35] hack she's watching probably but uh I
[46:39] think maybe it helps people that like I
[46:42] I thought like not even two years ago
[46:45] that girlfriend is just a time waste uh
[46:48] and it's just like for fun but it was
[46:52] yeah if you're optimizing for time and
[46:55] and just productivity definitely
[46:57] girlfriend is a waste of time but but
[46:59] life is more than that like at the end
[47:01] of the day the most important things in
[47:04] life is relationships and if it's not
[47:07] the most important thing in your life
[47:09] you should reevaluate your life that's
[47:11] like the people around you is everything
[47:14] so like
[47:16] definitely definitely like I'm bullish
[47:18] on girlriend
[47:20] that's a great thing yeah but I even
[47:24] make the argument like like of of course
[47:27] that I'm I'm not with a girlfriend just
[47:30] because to save time that would be a
[47:32] stupid AR man to make but I'm actually
[47:35] making the argument that a girlfriend is
[47:38] making you more productive it keeps you
[47:42] uh like maybe it's just me but it keeps
[47:45] me way more productive and energized
[47:48] throughout the whole day yeah I mean
[47:51] like short term
[47:53] definitely having a girlfriend doesn't
[47:55] help you Ty more sets it's it's the
[47:57] opposite but like long term long term if
[48:01] you find the right partner you're going
[48:03] to want to become better for their sake
[48:06] and they're going to want to build you
[48:08] up and the same for you know you want
[48:11] them to be the best version of
[48:12] themselves so it's a very much long-term
[48:14] play and something I like really
[48:17] thankful about Bitcoin is the it's just
[48:19] taught me so much about like having a
[48:22] low time preference and just thinking
[48:24] long term like I I think I mean I don't
[48:28] want to say I'm mature for my age but
[48:30] definitely like compared to other people
[48:32] my age it's definitely can see and maybe
[48:35] it's just my personality maybe I don't
[48:37] know how much Bitcoin contributed but
[48:39] definitely have this long-term thinking
[48:42] which is why I think about sport that
[48:44] like it's just something you have to do
[48:45] it's just like you have to eat well if
[48:47] you want to be successful long term and
[48:49] having relationships like you have to
[48:51] maintain them you have to work for
[48:54] relationships and
[48:56] um yeah it's like money is not
[48:59] everything money is just a it's just a
[49:02] way to an end it's to to get something
[49:05] else it's not the end goal yeah it's
[49:07] interesting how Bitcoin is also just
[49:10] money but it teaches you still the low
[49:14] time reference and those values and it
[49:16] it I I mean it depends from person to
[49:19] person uh I had persons on that where
[49:22] Bitcoin was really a dramatic uh piece
[49:25] in their life where the the life changed
[49:28] uh but they also had person on that
[49:30] already went on a good journey of a
[49:32] economics journey and then most most of
[49:35] them like older and they just Bitcoin
[49:37] came and it was natural to them they
[49:38] were already in that kind of mindset and
[49:40] it just an addition to their life it's
[49:43] interesting yeah well you say you say
[49:46] just Bitcoin is just money but that's
[49:48] like saying oxygen is just air that
[49:51] you're breathing like you're gonna die
[49:52] without oxygen and and Bitcoin is it
[49:54] affects
[49:56] so many things around us like it affects
[49:59] the culture it affects how people uh
[50:03] deal with each other it like money is
[50:06] half of every transaction every
[50:08] financial transaction so that's plays a
[50:11] huge role and it affects things we
[50:14] cannot even think about you know some
[50:16] people argue that it affects art it
[50:18] affects uh architecture it affects human
[50:22] relationships it affects uh like kind of
[50:24] like where the culture is going and
[50:27] that's all debatable but I do believe
[50:29] that it plays a huge role so like
[50:31] Bitcoin is just money but money is so
[50:35] important for like everything we do it's
[50:38] so fundamental to our life if it's like
[50:40] if you save in a money where your time
[50:43] is leaking out because it's bad money uh
[50:47] you will behave differently when you
[50:50] have uh sound money where your time is
[50:53] effectively saved and you can rely on
[50:56] that and build a solid foundation it's
[50:58] it's it's really true yeah and it's it's
[51:00] like like the underlying theme which I I
[51:03] when I talk to bitcoiners there's always
[51:05] this one word that comes up which is
[51:06] Hope like Bitcoin gives you it makes you
[51:10] hopeful for the future you actually want
[51:12] to wake up and see the future whereas
[51:14] you know I don't know how old you are
[51:16] but like most Millennials and gen gen Z
[51:19] they're not very optimistic for the
[51:21] Futures you know the climate the wars
[51:23] and I don't care about any of that since
[51:25] since I found Bitcoin and it's just
[51:28] because Bitcoin is a promise of a better
[51:32] world and like I do subscribe to that
[51:36] view so like I'm definitely a lot more
[51:38] optimistic hopeful for the future which
[51:41] then in turn helps me think long term
[51:44] about my relationships about my fitness
[51:46] about my you know my
[51:49] money so yeah Bitcoin is Hope yeah I
[51:53] also love that uh hope.com leads to
