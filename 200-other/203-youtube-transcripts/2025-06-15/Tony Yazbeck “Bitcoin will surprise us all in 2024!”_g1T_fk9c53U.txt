[00:00] when Trump speaks in Bitcoin Nashville
[00:02] he's going to say something extremely
[00:04] bullish what do you think is going to
[00:05] happen and that's the United States the
[00:07] biggest country where the most money is
[00:09] located when he makes Bitcoin part of
[00:12] some strategic Reserve in the US bitcoin
[00:15] price is going to catapult from wherever
[00:16] it is now to God knows what number pass
[00:19] six digits easily maybe even into into
[00:21] the millions he is definitely a changed
[00:23] human being especially after you know
[00:25] someone just attempted an assassination
[00:27] on your life you cannot remain the same
[00:30] human being I don't really care who's in
[00:32] power as long as the power of money is
[00:34] stripped from them all when they go all
[00:36] in with whatever is left on the global
[00:38] supply of Bitcoin was which isn't much
[00:40] maybe around 1 and a half million
[00:42] Bitcoin you're going to wake up one day
[00:43] the price is going to be some stupid
[00:44] amount and you're going to wonder what
[00:46] the hell happened I tried to blow it up
[00:47] myself failed tried to do it again
[00:49] failed again and then I learned that
[00:51] it's been you know 15 years in the
[00:52] making and that governments have tried
[00:53] to do that and they failed you know if
[00:55] you add all the taxes plus the debasing
[00:57] what's left so if you're making $100
[01:00] your purchasing power is what at the end
[01:01] of the day maybe 10 so 90% of it is
[01:04] being stolen from you so you're
[01:05] literally working 11 months out of the
[01:07] year like a dummy for free you have to
[01:09] do the work the only person that can
[01:11] make Bitcoin 100% solid secure is
[01:18] yourself there's like the Bitcoin ETF
[01:20] there's now Donald Trump supporting
[01:21] Bitcoin which was not on my my my radar
[01:24] for for this year uh we had the Haring
[01:26] in between uh what do you make out of
[01:29] all this this things well the last 72
[01:31] hours have been absolutely insane man
[01:33] it's like I'm watching a movie and I
[01:35] just can't believe you know when it was
[01:36] produced you know it's like it's like
[01:39] Jesus Christ look there's a lot of
[01:41] attention that's happening all of a
[01:42] sudden around around Bitcoin
[01:44] unfortunately the attempted
[01:46] assassination of you know former
[01:47] president Trump that that was that was
[01:50] absolutely disgusting and you know you
[01:52] can you can spin as many stories you
[01:53] want that around this um but at least
[01:57] you know to me from an outsider I don't
[01:59] think this was a coincidence I don't
[02:01] think this was you know something that
[02:03] was not pre-planned at Advance I think
[02:06] if you were not a believer in God before
[02:08] 72 hours you definitely might consider
[02:11] being one now because this was as far as
[02:14] I can tell divine intervention I mean he
[02:17] literally dodged the bullet you know on
[02:18] a on a hairline like he had not moved
[02:20] his head at precisely that exact
[02:22] millisecond he wouldn't be here and that
[02:26] as drastic and dramatic as it is I think
[02:28] cemented the you know the the future of
[02:31] America that moment is you know that you
[02:37] know sign of defiance that he came back
[02:39] with this is forever you know that that
[02:42] trigger is what went off you know at you
[02:45] know on that day and I think a large
[02:48] portion of America regardless of whether
[02:50] you you liked Trump before disliked him
[02:52] agree with his politics you don't do
[02:55] this you know like if you disagree with
[02:56] someone you don't kill them you know
[02:59] that's a that's a it's a sign of of
[03:00] weakness it's a sign of cowardice it's a
[03:02] sign that you're losing and you're
[03:03] pathetically desperate in your attempts
[03:06] to eliminate the competition which you
[03:08] failed at thankfully a lot of a lot of
[03:10] eyes are on the space he is definitely
[03:12] Pro Bitcoin you know I mean it's uh the
[03:14] more people you want you know on your
[03:16] side to accelerate the adoption is
[03:18] definitely a good thing as far as I'm
[03:20] concerned you know by Nature I don't
[03:23] trust politicians obviously you know
[03:24] they can say whatever they want to gain
[03:26] votes I mean maybe maybe maybe this is
[03:29] part of it maybe it isn't maybe he is a
[03:31] changed man I think to a large degree he
[03:33] is definitely a changed human being
[03:35] especially after you know someone just
[03:38] attempted an assassination on your life
[03:40] you cannot remain the same human being
[03:43] okay so how that ties into Bitcoin is
[03:46] yet to be seen you know he's he's still
[03:48] pushing forward you know wanting to talk
[03:50] at Bitcoin Nashville which is an
[03:51] extremely bullish move on his part a
[03:53] very brave one and um it's a true sign
[03:56] of leadership okay true sign of you know
[03:59] bravado true sign of a leader you know
[04:02] who who shows that he has what it takes
[04:04] to guide the country in the right
[04:07] direction again theoretically whether he
[04:10] does it succeeds at it that's another
[04:11] story but the energy that he's putting
[04:14] out is definitely you know aligned in uh
[04:17] in that way for me I don't really care
[04:21] who's in power as long as the power of
[04:24] money is stripped from them all okay
[04:28] whether it's Trump or somebody somebody
[04:30] else regardless of the country the
[04:32] government the idea here is to gain
[04:36] bitcoin's adoption to a point where it
[04:38] will strip the power of money from every
[04:41] single government so that they are no
[04:44] longer in a position to abuse you know
[04:47] sanction or censor and lead us to the
[04:50] mess the economic mess that we find
[04:52] ourselves in you know globally oh really
[04:55] cool it's uh it's it's fascinating to
[04:58] see how how Bitcoin gets more and more
[05:00] into the to the mainstream also now with
[05:02] the the Bitcoin ETF and I was wondering
[05:04] what's what's your take on this because
[05:06] um like it's so important to take
[05:09] responsibility for yourself to take
[05:11] responsibility in like freedom in your
[05:13] own hands um do you think that the
[05:16] Bitcoin ETF beyond that if you hold it
[05:19] yourself like that's a big risk but if
[05:21] you if you look at at Bitcoin could it
[05:23] be a dangerous thing that the coins are
[05:26] getting centralized they're basically
[05:28] all at coinbase some at other places uh
[05:31] but they're all like confiscated they're
[05:33] all like um there for the governments to
[05:36] take it is is that a risk that that you
[05:37] see that there are so many coins that
[05:39] they're uh getting there yeah of course
[05:42] I mean the ETF as far as I'm concerned
[05:44] at least the one in the United States is
[05:45] more of a marketing term you know to
[05:47] accelerate the attention to to bitcoin
[05:50] and perhaps adoption you know amongst
[05:52] those that have never considered it
[05:54] because now it's legitimized by
[05:56] personalities that you know they respect
[05:58] but the ETF you know it's the ETF itself
[06:01] is not Bitcoin the ETF you know is uh
[06:04] have exposure to Bitcoin in Fiat so any
[06:06] profits you make are still in the same
[06:09] you know debasing currency that you know
[06:12] that has always existed so you're there
[06:14] there's there's no winning with an ETF
[06:17] now the idea is that hopefully people
[06:19] who get into an ETF you know start
[06:21] studying it enough and learning enough
[06:23] about it to understand that this is not
[06:25] where they want to be that they actually
[06:26] want to be holding the real asset which
[06:28] leads them to bitcoin into in proper
[06:30] self-
[06:31] custody so whether they start with an
[06:34] ETF simply because you know that's just
[06:36] how they start and the the the end game
[06:38] is to getting them into you know where
[06:39] they're supposed to be where they are
[06:41] holding their private keys they are
[06:42] essentially their own bank they are the
[06:45] head of security they're doing
[06:46] everything themselves which is what
[06:48] they're supposed
[06:49] to as far as governments are concerned
[06:52] yeah absolutely I mean ETF is is the
[06:54] perfect Honeypot for you know a
[06:56] government to come and seize I mean
[06:58] every you know all the that's in there
[07:00] will automatically disappear you know
[07:01] and you have no you have no say in the
[07:03] matter because you know what are you
[07:05] going to do if it's not in your control
[07:06] it's not yours it's a simple as
[07:08] that I also loved your talk in in
[07:11] Bitcoin prag and you also shared uh
[07:13] before your your story uh why are you so
[07:15] passionate about self- custody maybe um
[07:17] to get the viewers in like why are you
[07:20] so passionate about self- custody and
[07:21] why should they care about self cust
[07:24] because like for me it's fascinating how
[07:26] many people still have the Bitcoin just
[07:28] on Exchange
[07:30] uh and when they have self custody
[07:32] sometimes have very very simple setups
[07:36] where they could easily um be attacked
[07:39] or could easily lose them anyways so um
[07:42] why is it important firstand like to
[07:44] take the step and do a self custody and
[07:46] then maybe later on like how can we um
[07:50] take proper self- custody well look when
[07:53] when everything is convenient and
[07:55] nothing's really changed for you you may
[07:57] not understand the urgency and why
[08:00] someone like myself is so adamant and
[08:02] passionate about you know Bitcoin in
[08:04] self- custody for those that are unaware
[08:06] I'll sum it up pretty quick um I woke up
[08:09] one day literally essentially thinking I
[08:11] was retired and the next day I was
[08:13] homeless why because the bank had seized
[08:15] my entire life savings not just mine but
[08:18] that of the entire country all right so
[08:20] when you experience something like this
[08:22] um the the shock and the path that it
[08:24] puts you through is something that I
[08:26] don't wish on anyone it is a movie that
[08:28] you categoric do not want to watch
[08:30] because the after effects of that on a
[08:33] on a nation is beyond anything you can
[08:36] possibly imagine so in my case I had two
[08:39] options either I go down the dark path
[08:41] and in which case I wouldn't be sitting
[08:43] here talking to you or I find the
[08:45] strength and the courage to rise up and
[08:48] figure out a way to ensure that this
[08:50] never ever happens to me or ever again
[08:53] although you know they may have thought
[08:54] they destroyed my life in in my case
[08:57] that's not what happened in fact they
[08:58] weaponized me in into you know a very
[09:01] aggressive tool of Education who whose
[09:04] number one priority here is to help
[09:06] teach every single individual out there
[09:09] how to make sure this never happens to
[09:11] them or their families ever again this
[09:14] is what brought me into Bitcoin it's not
[09:15] for fame it's not for money it's not for
[09:17] any of that it's for a purpose to make
[09:20] sure that the world heads in the right
[09:22] direction and that the corrupt Fiat
[09:24] system goes down so that we never have
[09:27] to succumb to its lies to it um to to
[09:30] its cancerous effects you know from now
[09:34] and forever it's it's fascinating for me
[09:36] we also had like with you Rick on um
[09:39] with with a also amazing story amazing
[09:43] story and a story where he lost the 25
[09:45] Bitcoin and we talked about it on the
[09:47] podcast maybe let's describe for the
[09:49] viewers when like you you lost on one
[09:53] day everything and then you go ahead and
[09:57] you're like oh now I have to work again
[09:59] like I have to start from zero I have to
[10:01] find the courage not to go down that uh
[10:04] dark path I have to find the courage to
[10:06] to use that in a good way not to be a
[10:10] lunatic and not go the the dark puff
[10:12] down but do the right thing in that
[10:14] moment I feel like that's really like I
[10:16] could not even comprehend I never went
[10:18] through anything similar to that um how
[10:22] how is that like how did you find in
[10:24] that place in that moment the co to do
[10:27] that and how long did it took like was
[10:28] it a week was like a year or how how
[10:31] long was it in in that phase it took a
[10:33] very long time it took me almost a year
[10:36] to come out of whatever mental state I
[10:39] was in to even consider making an
[10:42] effort to to rise again because
[10:47] everything was decimated I literally had
[10:49] nothing like no no money no hope um
[10:53] people that you know were supposedly
[10:54] friends automatically disappeared so you
[10:57] know I was I was left with three people
[11:00] that I would I could speak to you know
[11:02] from the thousands of folks that I was
[11:04] supposedly in touch with you know my
[11:06] entire life they all vanished so you
[11:10] know compound all of these losses on top
[11:12] of each other and it really like you
[11:14] cannot prepare for something like this
[11:17] it the the mental toll it takes on you
[11:19] is
[11:20] unfathomable so it took about a year and
[11:24] then you know it just hit me one day
[11:27] just you know in in my depress mood
[11:29] watching a video I think I landed on one
[11:31] of Andreas on top of on top of's videos
[11:35] and something struck you know like it
[11:36] hit a cord with me in one of his videos
[11:38] and it took me down the rabbit hole and
[11:40] this is how I discovered Bitcoin you
[11:42] know I and coming from a cyber security
[11:44] background obviously I have to question
[11:46] everything as well you know I'm like
[11:47] okay yeah sure okay this is like the
[11:49] golden ticket to to Paradise you know
[11:52] what's wrong with it and so I tried to
[11:54] blow it up myself failed tried to do it
[11:57] again failed again like all right let's
[11:59] let's try to you know do some more
[12:00] research ask some more intelligent
[12:02] people see what you know what they how
[12:04] far they've gotten failed um and then I
[12:06] learned that it's been you know 15 years
[12:08] in the making and the governments have
[12:10] tried to do that and they failed so I'm
[12:12] like all right toon so maybe there's
[12:13] some substance to this and this is you
[12:15] know where I started researching more
[12:17] and you know reading more spent like
[12:18] over know 20 30 40,000 hours you know
[12:21] diving deep into this trying to you know
[12:23] debunk everything good about it failed
[12:26] again and so after a certain point you
[12:28] realize that this is not a joke okay
[12:31] this is Bitcoin was not something that
[12:32] was created overnight this must have
[12:34] been something that was in the works for
[12:36] an extremely long time and the version
[12:38] we have now is actually the first time
[12:41] we have a working product you know a
[12:43] work a working money that's finite in
[12:46] Supply that nobody can control
[12:48] manipulate or screw around with the only
[12:50] thing you can do with it is hold and use
[12:51] it that's it and you don't need
[12:53] anybody's permission you know to to to
[12:57] transact with it that was the for me you
[13:00] know for me I needed I need to find a
[13:02] way to ensure that no one can rip me off
[13:05] again all right so where where's that
[13:07] option thankfully we have it if we
[13:09] didn't have Bitcoin we'd be in a very
[13:12] dire situation so but very quickly I
[13:15] learned that in order to take advantage
[13:17] of everything that Bitcoin offers you
[13:19] cannot be entrusting it to third parties
[13:22] it's as simple as that the illusion of
[13:24] convenience that we've been brainwashed
[13:26] to think you know that know companies
[13:27] will take care of you yeah you can trust
[13:29] them yeah they're okay they're good
[13:30] people forget it when things go bad
[13:34] you're not the priority you're the
[13:36] casualty and so in order not to put
[13:38] yourself in that predicament
[13:40] unfortunately you're going to have to do
[13:42] the work and by work I mean learning
[13:44] something new it's not nuclear science
[13:46] Bitcoin in self- custody is not you're
[13:48] not putting a man on the moon you're
[13:50] learning a few extra steps that's it so
[13:54] the fear and anxiety that people have
[13:56] with this is because it's technology and
[13:59] most people are not very comfortable on
[14:01] a computer so they automatically think
[14:03] that they're going to mess it up somehow
[14:05] and I don't believe that's true because
[14:07] I've worked with hundreds of folks from
[14:10] all walks of life most of them have zero
[14:13] computer backgrounds zero technical
[14:15] skills but yet when you have a good
[14:17] teacher that's able to translate this
[14:20] complexity into a language that a
[14:22] 10-year-old can understand that
[14:24] everything is easy and every single one
[14:26] of them to this day is the captain of
[14:28] Their Own ship with full self-confidence
[14:31] they send they receive they sleep well
[14:33] at night they have absolutely zero
[14:35] concerns about anything in fact a lot of
[14:38] them move up into some of the more
[14:41] Advanced Techniques on their own later
[14:44] on as you know as all this knowledge
[14:48] cements in their head and they become
[14:49] really comfortable with it then you know
[14:52] they have the courage that's okay can we
[14:54] improve it a little bit more of course
[14:56] you know but you have to start somewhere
[14:58] and this is you know this is the process
[15:00] that we guide everyone through from
[15:02] beginning to Infinity it's technology
[15:05] it's progressing it's not a set it and
[15:07] forget it thing again you are the head
[15:09] of security you're the bank so you
[15:12] always have to stay on top of this
[15:14] because this is your generational wealth
[15:16] if you lose it you're not getting it
[15:17] back unless you earn it or if it's still
[15:21] somewhat affordable to you buy it but
[15:23] the days of buying Bitcoin those are
[15:25] going to disappear very very quickly in
[15:27] fact I think 2020 4 will be the year
[15:30] where I'd say 95% of the world cannot
[15:33] buy Bitcoin anymore because of all the
[15:36] big institutional and big player
[15:38] interest now that all of a sudden
[15:40] they're foming in because they've
[15:42] studied Bitcoin they understand what it
[15:44] is and they and they they fully are
[15:46] fully cognizant that if they don't hedge
[15:49] against a collapsing fiat currency all
[15:53] their High net worth value is going to
[15:55] come down to one big fat zero so you
[15:58] know you have these big players with
[16:00] unlimited budgets so to speak against
[16:03] regular folks like you and me so when
[16:05] they go all in with whatever is left you
[16:08] know on the global supply of Bitcoin
[16:10] which isn't much maybe around one and a
[16:12] half million Bitcoin you're going to
[16:14] wake up one day the price is going to be
[16:16] some stupid amount and you're going to
[16:17] wonder what the hell
[16:19] happened you you said 2044 no
[16:24] 2024 this year this year yes so you
[16:27] think that Beyond that year normal folks
[16:30] cannot then buy Bitcoin or look what's
[16:34] happening look what's going to happen on
[16:37] the way to just the US
[16:40] elections when Trump speaks in Bitcoin
[16:44] Nashville I don't know what he's going
[16:45] to say but I'm assuming he's going to
[16:47] say something extremely bullish what do
[16:50] you think is going to happen right and
[16:53] that's the United States the biggest
[16:55] country where the most money is located
[16:59] if they fomo in actually it's not if
[17:02] it's when they fomo in because now it's
[17:04] legitimized again you don't Bitcoin
[17:06] doesn't need to be legitimized but in
[17:09] the brains of the masses that works so
[17:12] whatever it is that gets them into
[17:13] Bitcoin doesn't really matter as long as
[17:15] they get into it so when it's
[17:17] legitimized of course they're going to
[17:19] fo a win when if he makes um Bitcoin
[17:23] part of some strategic Reserve in the US
[17:27] what do you think is going to happen
[17:29] Bitcoin the Bitcoin price is going to
[17:30] catapult from wherever it is now to God
[17:33] knows what number past six digits easily
[17:36] maybe even into into the millions
[17:38] because now you've got you know the high
[17:40] net worth institutions with the billion
[17:42] dollar budgets they're like we need to
[17:45] get this and
[17:46] quickly so that type of fomo will take
[17:50] Bitcoin to
[17:51] astronomical um Fiat values and yeah of
[17:55] course that means that the normal folk
[17:57] is not going to afford anything so how
[17:59] do they take advantage of it well it's
[18:01] very simple they're going to have to
[18:03] earn it that means you know folks going
[18:05] going to work will no longer want to be
[18:08] paid in this toilet paper local currency
[18:11] they're going to say pay me in SATs I
[18:13] don't want the dollar I don't want the
[18:15] Euro it's worth nothing that
[18:16] garbage I can't buy anything with it pay
[18:19] me in SS that's what I think is going to
[18:21] happen that's how the masses are going
[18:24] to benefit from Bitcoin because if you
[18:26] can't buy it anymore like you know most
[18:28] people have been doing for the last 15
[18:30] years that there's no other way to get
[18:32] it that's that's a major concept there
[18:36] it's really interesting for me because
[18:37] like we we built out all the buckets
[18:39] like we have nation states with Salvador
[18:41] and others in the game we have not the
[18:43] ETFs the institutional we have publicly
[18:45] traded company we like we have like
[18:47] built in the last few years all the
[18:49] buckets and now they just wait to get
[18:51] filled and get get up it's like uh
[18:54] fascinating if it actually goes that
[18:56] quick with the United States and and
[18:58] Trump and I I I also guess that there's
[19:00] something big coming he's not coming to
[19:02] a Bitcoin conference just to say hello
[19:04] like he's he he has some agenda he has
[19:07] some some some things that he wants to
[19:09] announce there he's not just coming
[19:10] there to like hey I'm in Bitcoin now
[19:12] like he has to say something absolutely
[19:16] I don't know what his motives are but
[19:18] I'm fairly confident that whoever's been
[19:20] speaking to him in the background has
[19:22] been educating him enough about Bitcoin
[19:26] that it's changed his position
[19:29] now again it could be for votes it could
[19:31] be some ulterior motive but I think in a
[19:33] big enough part he actually believes it
[19:36] you know I mean you you you can almost
[19:38] tell from the way he talks about it now
[19:40] more every time he says something about
[19:42] it that he's been learning more and he's
[19:45] like just fascinated with what what he's
[19:47] seeing so how that what that translates
[19:51] into at the end of the day if he becomes
[19:54] president which I really hope he does um
[19:57] is to be seen but But ultimately
[20:00] ultimately even he has to accept that
[20:04] for this to really flourish and to take
[20:07] the nation into that utopian future that
[20:10] he's talking about he has to let go of
[20:13] the power of money from the state that's
[20:16] a big one so whether that happens or not
[20:20] I have no idea ultimately I think it
[20:23] happens over time okay but whether it
[20:26] happens quickly now this year next year
[20:28] that's anybody's guess I'm
[20:31] hopeful that it does but Tik Tok let's
[20:36] wait absolutely and it's like time is on
[20:39] our side like we we are in here like uh
[20:42] we're doing our work and we're doing the
[20:44] things and if anyone here listening is
[20:46] not in Bitcoin or is not uh doing self
[20:49] custy like it's now time to actually
[20:51] take it seriously and there's also
[20:52] something that came up when we talked
[20:54] with Rick and I think that's an an
[20:56] amazingly important um thing to do get
[21:00] your Bitcoin and your self- custody
[21:03] properly right before you get I think he
[21:05] meant it like hilariously rich like
[21:07] before you get that God candle to like1
[21:11] million US dollar uh in in in in Bitcoin
[21:14] before that you you have to take the
[21:16] steps and not like oh wow all of the
[21:19] sudden I have like three million in in
[21:21] my Bitcoin W now let's call Tony now
[21:25] what to do the the problem is why why so
[21:28] many people people are still hesitant
[21:29] about this first of all it's because
[21:30] it's new and second of all is because
[21:33] you know we're not living in the future
[21:34] yet you know if there was a way to sort
[21:36] of like kick you 30 years you know ahead
[21:39] so you can see what uh what the future
[21:42] um built on something like Bitcoin looks
[21:44] like and then you know bring you back
[21:46] into here you'd be accumulating it like
[21:48] your life dependent on it but in order
[21:51] to have that Vision to have that
[21:53] conviction this is where you know you
[21:55] have to do the work you have to do the
[21:56] reading you have to ask the questions
[21:59] you've got you've got to study it
[22:00] because you know you've never seen it
[22:02] before it sounds like it's too good to
[22:04] be true you know a lot of a lot of
[22:05] Skeptics have tried to debunk it have to
[22:08] try to blow it up have to made it fail
[22:10] they all failed okay so bitcoin's not
[22:12] going anywhere and now that the the big
[22:15] players are paying serious attention to
[22:17] it I suspect in the near future
[22:20] especially like if um if someone like
[22:22] Trump becomes president I suspect I
[22:25] strongly suspect that at some point
[22:27] anyone at attempting to mess around with
[22:29] the Bitcoin Network on any level will be
[22:32] committing a crime you know that's
[22:35] that's how big I think it's going to
[22:37] become because now you know if countries
[22:40] are using it as its space Reserve well
[22:43] they're not going to tolerate any funny
[22:45] business to towards it right whether
[22:48] it's successful or not that's besides
[22:49] the point if you screw around and caught
[22:52] trying to mess around with the Bitcoin
[22:53] Network you'll be thrown in jail or
[22:55] something something along those lines I
[22:58] genuinely strongly believe that this is
[23:00] going to happen as soon as there's like
[23:03] a um um a legal legitimization of
[23:06] Bitcoin in any one of these big
[23:08] countries and then the rest will follow
[23:10] then the copycats will just you know
[23:12] apply it across the board that that's
[23:14] fascinating so you think that the law
[23:17] actually right now that sometimes goes a
[23:19] little bit against Bitcoin and
[23:21] especially with KC and all all that
[23:22] things um that will in the future
[23:25] actually protect the network protect the
[23:27] monetary polic of Bitcoin so like if you
[23:30] mess with Bitcoin you you cannot do that
[23:33] like absolutely absolutely because now
[23:36] it's the foundation powering your
[23:38] country it's the foundation fueling your
[23:39] economy everything is is based on it so
[23:44] the technology is is Rock Solid and it's
[23:46] going to continue to be improved and all
[23:48] that stuff but I'm 100% sure that they
[23:52] are going to be rules to protect it
[23:54] further more just to avoid any potential
[23:58] risk to it that you may or may not see
[24:01] you know immediately so if you had if
[24:04] someone had any like like stupid ideas
[24:07] to try to mess with it having a law like
[24:10] this in place should de incentivize most
[24:14] crazy people you know that's fascinating
[24:18] yeah okay let's let's go in there like
[24:20] uh when okay let's say Trump announces
[24:22] something in in end of July on starting
[24:25] in August uh then like we wake up to 100
[24:28] priz maybe wake up a few weeks later
[24:30] that $250,000 prize maybe end of the
[24:33] year maybe some somewhere next year like
[24:35] a millions or something like
[24:37] that what what do you think happens that
[24:40] like the the major players are in um
[24:43] what are the like the immediate steps of
[24:45] like governments of banks of central
[24:47] banks does central banks announce that
[24:49] they're buying Bitcoin and trying to
[24:51] back the US dollar with with Bitcoin or
[24:53] something like that they probably will
[24:55] have to you know I mean if they want to
[24:56] remain relevant I don't think they have
[24:58] option if Bitcoin reaches let's say a
[25:00] million dollars or more in Fiat value
[25:02] that means that the dollar is literally
[25:04] worth nothing okay I mean you don't get
[25:06] the million dollar Bitcoin and maintain
[25:09] the purchasing power of the Dollar's
[25:11] value today that's not that that's like
[25:13] somebody's wet dream that's not the way
[25:15] it works so this is where the Panic
[25:18] there I think there will be a lot of
[25:19] panic you know like you know PE most
[25:21] people are going to be saying like why
[25:22] didn't anybody tell me where did this
[25:23] come from I've never heard of it before
[25:25] you know blah blah all that stuff and
[25:27] you know the the world will change very
[25:29] very quickly maybe in a little bit of a
[25:31] panic mode because I don't think this is
[25:33] going to be anything you can um quietly
[25:36] control right because when something
[25:38] breaks it it it it breaks so this is
[25:41] what I think is going to happen and you
[25:43] know like I said earlier people will are
[25:45] going to start demanding to be paid in
[25:47] it they're no longer want they they'll
[25:49] no longer accept working for you know a
[25:52] worthless piece of paper because they're
[25:54] essentially working for free you're
[25:56] essentially already working almost for
[25:58] or free depending where you are now if
[26:00] your job your your income is still in
[26:03] Fiat dollars or in fiat currency because
[26:06] one you're earning in a in a piece of
[26:09] paper that's losing value at an
[26:11] accelerating rate I'd say around maybe
[26:13] 15% or more depending where you are
[26:16] that's one two you're being taxed on it
[26:19] depending where you are that can be up
[26:20] to 50% so what's left you know if you
[26:23] add all the taxes plus the debasing
[26:26] what's left so if you're making $100
[26:29] your purchasing power is what at the end
[26:31] of the day maybe 10 so 90% of it is
[26:34] being stolen from you so you're
[26:36] literally working 11 months out of the
[26:38] year like a dummy for free when you're
[26:42] when when you were in the Fiat standard
[26:44] right depending again where you live I
[26:46] mean there's a range but for sure most
[26:49] of your year you are working for free if
[26:51] you actually take the time to do the
[26:52] math and realize hey wait a minute I'm
[26:55] not just being ripped off because I
[26:57] can't afford anything at the super
[26:58] Market I'm being ripped off from all
[27:01] parts and you know once that sinks in
[27:04] you know someone with a bit of Common
[27:06] Sense will be like how do I stop
[27:09] this that's when you start hopefully
[27:11] asking the intelligent questions and no
[27:13] matter where you look okay there's no
[27:16] company that can make it safer that's a
[27:17] myth that's that's okay you
[27:20] have to do the work the only person that
[27:22] can make Bitcoin 100% solid secure is
[27:26] yourself there's no such thing I can't
[27:28] do it I'm too stupid nobody's too stupid
[27:30] you may be too lazy or you maybe come up
[27:33] with some sort of excuse to justify why
[27:35] you don't want to do it but
[27:37] intellectually I've yet to meet anyone
[27:40] that you know cannot follow clear and
[27:43] concise and uh instructions you know so
[27:47] in the Fiat world nothing about your
[27:50] money or your information is private the
[27:53] kyc that you're doing is not for your
[27:56] protection it's it's a
[27:58] it's a it's a it's a surveillance tool
[28:01] okay so when people are using Bitcoin in
[28:04] a kyc environment they're essentially
[28:08] indirectly painting a Target on
[28:10] themselves because
[28:11] now wherever that kyc information is you
[28:15] have no control over how it's being
[28:17] stored so when you think you're doing
[28:20] you know uh you're using a company to
[28:21] protect your Bitcoin but you have to kyc
[28:24] with them well do you know how they're
[28:27] saving your information information you
[28:29] have no idea you're assuming they're
[28:31] doing a good job because they're
[28:33] reputable right but many big companies
[28:37] have been hacked and what happens when
[28:39] they're hacked well you're a casualty of
[28:42] that problem now you have to deal with
[28:43] it but the difference is now this is
[28:46] Bitcoin the world's most valuable never
[28:49] seen before asset so if someone who's
[28:52] holding your information that you own x
[28:54] amount of Bitcoin gets hacked the person
[28:57] who hacked him this is not an idiot this
[28:59] is someone who knows exactly what
[29:01] they're going after and why so now
[29:03] you've got potentially a big problem
[29:06] that you have to deal with your own
[29:09] protection okay
[29:11] so don't trust verify when you're not
[29:16] doing the work yourself
[29:18] 100% you you the individual are
[29:23] introducing probably a lot of times
[29:25] unknowingly but you are introducing
[29:28] unnecessary risk to yourself right so at
[29:32] the Bitcoin way we are trying to push
[29:35] this education as much as possible to
[29:40] hopefully let it sink in deep enough
[29:43] that people understand that the old
[29:46] habits of relying on somebody else they
[29:49] don't work in fact in this case they can
[29:52] potentially be
[29:54] dangerous so there's a lot of
[29:56] information you know that we have to
[29:59] unlearn and relearn in order to
[30:02] move properly into the future that we
[30:06] want if you watch or listen to my
[30:08] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[30:10] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[30:13] the most important step is to keep the
[30:16] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[30:19] wallet my personal recommendation for
[30:21] Hardware wallet is the bit box it's
[30:23] super secure it's simple to set up it's
[30:25] also perfect gift for a friend who has
[30:28] has still the Bitcoin on an exchange and
[30:31] you can get a 5% discount with the code
[30:34] Robin at the checkout visit bitbox do
[30:37] Swiss robobin to get your bitbox and if
[30:41] you really want to bulletproof yourself
[30:43] C setup your security setup and maybe
[30:46] even your citizenship setup you have to
[30:49] talk to the Bitcoin way if you go to the
[30:52] Bitcoin way.com
[30:54] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[30:58] free call where you can dive deep with
[31:01] them if your self custody setup is
[31:04] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[31:07] maybe might be improvable or your
[31:09] digital footprint in general is secure
[31:13] they are the experts in cyber security
[31:15] in Bitcoin self- custody and how to be a
[31:18] secure sovereign individual in general
[31:22] and for those of you who are in search
[31:23] of a new Bitcoin exchange where they can
[31:25] buy their Bitcoin from I recommend my
[31:28] personal Bitcoin exchange 21 Bitcoin
[31:31] with code Robin you get a hey discount
[31:35] for all your purchases in the future
[31:37] it's it's fascinating for me like when
[31:39] we go uh in self cast I feel like
[31:41] there's like a lot of mistakes that
[31:43] happen like the first and number one
[31:45] mistake is like they don't do it I think
[31:48] that's yeah that's number one that's
[31:50] number one um but for those who want to
[31:53] do it or who already have a setup what
[31:56] should they first look at like what's
[31:58] the the major things they're like okay
[32:00] let's let's fix that first let's do that
[32:02] first uh and see if there's like what
[32:04] are like your first like three four
[32:06] questions that you usually ask someone
[32:08] who already has a self custody that's an
[32:11] excellent question again you know
[32:12] Bitcoin is technology so you can't be
[32:15] you know nonchalant about the components
[32:18] that you use to do self- custody we're
[32:20] very strict on the recommendations we do
[32:22] for hardware and software because you
[32:24] know you want to minimize the risks as
[32:27] much as possible
[32:28] so we only work with open source and or
[32:31] verifiable Source Bitcoin only products
[32:34] okay anything or anyone that you know
[32:37] engages in censorship that does you know
[32:39] chain analysis all of that stuff we
[32:41] automatically boycott them we don't
[32:42] recommend them we don't sell anything
[32:44] ourselves we are like like you know like
[32:46] that Switzerland of knowledge here we're
[32:48] neutral ground where we're always on the
[32:50] lookout for what's new what's good
[32:53] what's bad in order to push out these
[32:55] recommendations to folks um we're big
[32:58] fans of air gapped Hardware wallets if
[33:01] your Hardware wallets connects to the
[33:02] computer for us it doesn't work now it
[33:05] could be safe today right but I come
[33:08] from cyber security I know that bugs
[33:10] whether intentional or not can happen at
[33:12] any point in time right so if it happens
[33:16] God knows when and you become a a victim
[33:19] of that of that bug and it's too late so
[33:23] why take the risk when you know you
[33:25] don't have to take the risk okay so you
[33:28] have to be very strict about these
[33:30] things even if there's a 0.01% that
[33:33] something can go wrong we won't take it
[33:35] and we will not recommend that you the
[33:38] individual take it because we have an
[33:40] option where your risk is zero or at
[33:42] least closer to zero than that and so
[33:45] this is the mindset that we deploy when
[33:48] you know we guide people through that
[33:50] process we're not looking at the Bitcoin
[33:52] price today we're looking at the value
[33:56] of this asset
[33:58] 50 hundred years into the future and
[34:01] guarding it with dear life starting
[34:03] today okay and this is again it's not a
[34:06] set it and forget it procedure you know
[34:08] as the technology progresses you need to
[34:11] keep up with your own setup so I'm the
[34:14] type of person if there's like a half an
[34:16] inch Improvement that can be done to my
[34:18] already bulletproof configuration I will
[34:21] do it and I will tell you about it so
[34:24] that you can consider doing it yourself
[34:27] that's like the moral High Ground that
[34:29] we that we use you know when we approach
[34:31] these things everybody here is becoming
[34:33] you know their own head of security and
[34:36] so you need to take this stuff seriously
[34:38] because when you wake up one day and you
[34:40] see the Bitcoin price at like a billion
[34:42] dollars you're going to thank God that
[34:45] you've done the work and that you're for
[34:48] the most part um sleeping well at night
[34:51] and even then as soon as you see these
[34:53] crazy numbers even though your setup is
[34:55] Flawless you're going to still think
[34:58] there are ways to improve it that's just
[35:00] human instinct you know like oh my gosh
[35:02] now it's worth that much am I okay right
[35:06] so it's important to stay you know calm
[35:08] and collected and not you know go crazy
[35:10] in a situation like this because that's
[35:11] when you know um silly mistakes happen
[35:14] so this is what we're here for we're on
[35:16] top of this um 247 you know no no one at
[35:20] the Bitcoin way um sleeps you know we've
[35:23] been professional Nappers you know for a
[35:25] very long time now so
[35:28] uh and and that's why you know like
[35:30] again like my mission here really is to
[35:33] empower folks to genuinely understand
[35:37] this you know because when you come from
[35:40] where I came
[35:42] from you don't want to see anybody go
[35:44] through that like it's very hard for you
[35:47] to comprehend what I'm trying to relay
[35:49] to you because unless you've been in my
[35:53] shoes you know it's it's never 100% you
[35:57] know you can imagine how crazy it is but
[35:59] unless you're in the in that position in
[36:02] in my shoes you will never be really you
[36:06] know you can't really feel what what
[36:08] fuels someone who has been there before
[36:11] and I pray to God you never have to be
[36:14] it's interesting I think um when we uh
[36:17] look at Bitcoin on bitcoin as why they
[36:19] don't do self custody why don't they
[36:21] don't care about self custody that much
[36:23] is like they hold
[36:25] a amount of Bitcoin it's maybe like 10%
[36:28] of the net worth it's maybe 15% of the
[36:30] net worth and they don't take this
[36:33] amount too serious and when we look at
[36:35] the past of like 10 years back in
[36:37] Bitcoin that's why all those early
[36:39] bitcoiners lost their Bitcoin because
[36:40] they left it on some uh some USB stick
[36:43] or some somewhere and they throw it out
[36:46] or the computer that it was on they
[36:48] threw the computer out because they did
[36:50] did not took that 10,000 pit Cod that
[36:52] was on the laptop series but if you look
[36:54] at now it makes like oh why did they
[36:56] throw that see um so I think it helps a
[37:00] lot when when we think about self
[37:02] custody what's the future value as you
[37:04] also said like in 50 years in 100 years
[37:07] um and that's leading up to my question
[37:09] like what do you think is an significant
[37:12] amount in Bitcoin when we talk about
[37:14] Sates is like a million Sates uh for
[37:18] people to to know like what what will
[37:21] that buy what what what will be the
[37:23] significance of owning like a million
[37:25] Sates 10 million Sates 100,000 Sates in
[37:28] like 00 years that's a very good
[37:30] question and nobody really knows but
[37:32] what I can tell you it's going to be
[37:33] worth a lot more than people think I
[37:36] mean again this is this is such a scarce
[37:39] asset that you don't need much of it to
[37:42] for it to make a like an impactful
[37:44] change on your life the key to this is
[37:47] not how much of it you own because past
[37:49] a certain amount whether you know you
[37:51] own a billion or a trillion like what
[37:53] are you going to do you're going to eat
[37:54] more you're going to fly more you're
[37:56] going to do more you're not you're not
[37:57] nothing is really going to change past a
[37:58] certain point it's just sitting there
[38:02] just a like a a flex symbol right but
[38:06] practically nothing's going to really
[38:08] change um so you don't need much of it
[38:10] you know a lot of people think oh I
[38:11] can't afford an entire Bitcoin but you
[38:13] don't have to own an entire Bitcoin own
[38:15] whatever you can now just get out or at
[38:18] least start coming out of that failing
[38:21] money that you think is good for you
[38:23] into something that'll actually
[38:25] appreciate and value ignore the
[38:27] volatility because it's only temporary
[38:29] you know we're transitioning from an old
[38:30] system into a new one so of course
[38:32] there's going to be this but this is
[38:34] temporary but for you not to panic when
[38:37] you see this you need to understand what
[38:39] the uh what the asset is about the
[38:42] problem is in like in in those in
[38:44] privileged countries is that people are
[38:46] adopting Bitcoin from a from a safe
[38:49] perspective oh we're buying it you know
[38:51] like it's because um I'm going to become
[38:54] even more Rich you know like they're
[38:55] buying it but you know they have one one
[38:57] foot here and one foot there like one
[38:59] foot is in Bitcoin as an investment but
[39:01] they continue to live in in the Fiat
[39:04] world because they're only calculating
[39:06] their value of Bitcoin in Fiat numbers
[39:08] which is the complete ridiculous mindset
[39:10] if you're going to live on a Bitcoin
[39:12] standard and you genuinely believe in
[39:14] Bitcoin then live on a Bitcoin standard
[39:17] and adopt the Bitcoin ethos don't sit on
[39:21] the sidelines telling the world yeah I'm
[39:23] in Bitcoin but then everything about you
[39:25] is Fiat because one one you're a
[39:28] hypocrite and two you're not doing it
[39:30] properly and three you're likely to make
[39:32] to to to to probably sell if something
[39:35] extreme happens enough to you you will
[39:38] screw it up somehow right so and there's
[39:42] a lot of people in the space that I
[39:43] noticed are doing this you know Bitcoin
[39:46] influencers but you know when you when
[39:48] you scratch
[39:49] Beyond The
[39:51] Influence they're Fiat people at the
[39:54] core so how do you know this well do you
[39:58] accept Bitcoin payments no why you talk
[40:02] about Bitcoin all day it's the greatest
[40:03] thing since Humanity right but do you
[40:06] accept Bitcoin payments no so what are
[40:08] you doing why why don't you accept it I
[40:11] have to ask my accountant why does he
[40:13] know about Bitcoin your accountant all
[40:15] he is is a government prostitute you
[40:17] know put into place to make sure that
[40:19] they get paid why are you asking your
[40:21] accountant he knows nothing about
[40:23] Bitcoin why do you need his
[40:25] permission Bitcoin when was created to
[40:28] empower you the individual it means you
[40:31] don't need anybody's permission you
[40:33] don't need the government's permission
[40:34] you don't need your accountant's
[40:35] permission you don't need your wife's
[40:37] permission you don't need your partner's
[40:38] permission you don't need anybody's
[40:40] permission all you need to do is
[40:43] understand what it is have enough
[40:45] conviction and then you are your own
[40:47] boss right Bitcoin in self- custody is
[40:51] King your freedom is attached to that
[40:55] because without your money
[40:57] you're nothing you're somebody else's
[41:00] donkey because if they can control your
[41:02] money you can't do anything and we saw
[41:06] this happen three four years ago right
[41:09] where do you think central bank digital
[41:11] currencies are are for is to tighten the
[41:16] grip on the surveillance State what are
[41:20] your options if you get stuck in this
[41:22] system you are finished my friend you
[41:25] are categorically finished
[41:28] because nothing about your decisions are
[41:30] yours
[41:31] anymore so if you don't want to find
[41:33] yourself in this predicament you cannot
[41:36] trust anything outside of yourself if
[41:40] you
[41:41] do you're an
[41:43] idiot because you again you are bringing
[41:47] in this unnecessary risk to your life to
[41:50] your freedom if you have kids to their
[41:52] lives and their
[41:53] Futures
[41:54] so there's a lot to absorb with
[41:58] something like Bitcoin because again
[42:00] we've never had this option before right
[42:03] so people need to take the time to study
[42:05] it properly to understand it that it's
[42:07] not just some lunatic on the internet
[42:09] just pushing it because whatever there's
[42:11] a reason but you need to do it right you
[42:15] need to stop listening you know to the
[42:17] to the bells and whistles and understand
[42:21] at the core what your responsibilities
[42:24] are because if it's not done right
[42:27] you are taking a chance of losing it
[42:31] all uh short story time um because Tony
[42:36] you also pushed me that finally I also
[42:38] accept Bitcoin for for my sponsorships
[42:40] and and for
[42:41] Partnerships because uh I I
[42:44] procrastinated like as you said like I
[42:46] was like I know how to do all the things
[42:49] because I come from sales I come from
[42:50] the feed world I I know how to do all
[42:52] the bookkeeping I know how to do
[42:53] everything in the Fiat world and I
[42:55] always procrastinated with accepting
[42:57] Bitcoin payments uh and because it's
[43:00] like ah I have to think about how to do
[43:02] it but then I was like I'm a
[43:05] hypocrite like I talk about Bitcoin all
[43:08] day long and then I don't accept it and
[43:10] yeah I'm I'm really glad that uh that
[43:12] you were like the the last final push
[43:15] that I needed to like oh let's actually
[43:17] work on a Bitcoin standard like what
[43:20] like if if I really want to be 100% in
[43:23] Bitcoin it does not like I have
[43:24] everything in Bitcoin I have just a
[43:27] small bank account that I use for my
[43:29] everyday payments where I cannot pay
[43:31] with Bitcoin but ex beyond that I also
[43:34] have to accepted and I also have to try
[43:36] to live as close to bitcoin standard as
[43:39] as humanly possible uh right now because
[43:42] I'm in Austria um so yeah I also accept
[43:46] that because of you are like you were
[43:48] the final final straw that I needed to
[43:51] accept the Bitcoin standard also in for
[43:53] for for my podcast So yeah thank you for
[43:55] for doing that by the way well you're
[43:57] very welcome and I'm glad I'm glad it
[43:59] was helpful because you know there's
[44:00] there's a lot of fear involved in doing
[44:02] something like this because you know
[44:04] you've been brainwashing the day you
[44:05] were born to think that you know you
[44:07] have to do you have to obey the
[44:09] government you have to use their money
[44:10] you have to pay their taxes you have to
[44:12] you have to essentially you have to be
[44:15] remain you know a government stoe you
[44:17] know that that that's essentially what
[44:18] you're brainwashed since day one and now
[44:21] you don't have to but because your brain
[44:23] is still wired that way it's it's very
[44:25] hard for people to break that that
[44:28] mindset it's almost like a a drug
[44:30] addiction you know it's bad for you but
[44:32] it's like it's almost impossible for you
[44:34] to let go unless somebody rips you out
[44:37] of it and then you're clean and then you
[44:39] can move forward in uh in the right
[44:42] direction accepting Bitcoin encouraging
[44:44] others to accept Bitcoin so that you
[44:46] know circular economies grow at a much
[44:49] faster rate it's a it's important
[44:52] everybody's life improves dramatically
[44:55] on a Bitcoin standard you just just have
[44:57] to make the first step to first of all
[45:00] understand it but then do it just just
[45:03] try it and it's it's almost like magical
[45:06] when you see how well life changes for
[45:09] you I've never met a bitcoiner that
[45:11] complains about money and I'm not I'm
[45:14] not talking about high net worth
[45:16] individuals I'm talking about extremely
[45:19] regular folks like myself that have
[45:22] nothing that have lost everything and
[45:24] are just now starting to re build their
[45:27] lives so their economic financial status
[45:31] is almost
[45:33] flatlined but why aren't they
[45:36] complaining it's because with whatever
[45:38] little crumbs that they have somehow
[45:42] they can pay for everything without
[45:44] having to stress I'm not talking about
[45:46] going out and buying Lamborghinis and
[45:48] private jets and all that stupidities
[45:50] I'm talking about having a nice modest
[45:52] happy life with people that align with
[45:55] your values which is again something
[45:58] that you uh you gain on a Bitcoin
[46:00] standard because you start um being
[46:03] attracted to folks that are also
[46:04] bitcoiners and it's almost like a
[46:06] magical connection when you meet someone
[46:08] for the first time if they're a
[46:10] bitcoiner somehow there's always
[46:12] conversations that flow smoothly between
[46:14] you right like there's always things in
[46:16] common even though you've never seen
[46:18] this person for you know except for the
[46:19] last five
[46:21] minutes so there's a lot to gain that
[46:24] are unspoken of you know and
[46:28] I think those that are not making the
[46:30] effort to to understand this properly
[46:33] are missing out on on such a beautiful
[46:36] future I mean if you're on a Bitcoin
[46:38] standard you're already for the most
[46:39] part living in the future um and for
[46:42] those that are still hesitating I
[46:43] strongly urge you to change that mindset
[46:47] or at least consider changing it for
[46:50] your own benefit now I just have to go
[46:52] to to Google uh because they they pay me
[46:55] with AdSense to I have to ask them also
[46:58] if they pay me in Bitcoin yeah good luck
[47:00] with
[47:03] that the other sponsors are probably
[47:05] easy they they will pay me in Bitcoin
[47:07] but the Google will be a hard
[47:09] one yeah I know Google is still a matrix
[47:12] uh Matrix player unfortunately but but
[47:15] they also pay Bitcoin as so it's okay
[47:19] Bitcoin but but yeah um do but by the
[47:22] way do do you have a Fiat bank account
[47:25] do do you need some like do you have
[47:27] your setup so far that you don't even
[47:29] need the the Fiat bank account I have a
[47:31] Fiat bank account but I haven't seen it
[47:33] in like uh God knows when like I don't I
[47:36] don't touch it anymore you know like I
[47:38] mean it's there but you know if I I need
[47:40] it for something really ex like really
[47:42] specific other than that I have no use
[47:45] for it just dealing just just the
[47:47] thought I have to deal with these
[47:49] dimwits at the bank is enough for me not
[47:52] to want to go to that bank you know so
[47:56] um you just from a stress level you know
[47:59] like if you want to live a nice peaceful
[48:01] life a nice Zen life you avoid the Fiat
[48:04] system because it'll just you know make
[48:07] your blood boy you know when I see
[48:09] stories online about people want to
[48:10] withdraw cash and then this 50 Cent
[48:14] nobody tells them not today you know
[48:16] like what how are you supposed to
[48:18] react uh totally agree um one one
[48:23] question that I ask myself a lot and I
[48:24] also ask it a lot in in the in the
[48:27] podcast um when we talk about self-
[48:30] custody uh it seems that right now not a
[48:33] lot of people actually adopted a proper
[48:36] self- custody standard um do you think
[48:39] that proper self- custody will ever be
[48:42] mainstream or will it always be for a
[48:44] small woken up group that actually
[48:48] understand what's going on no I think
[48:49] the adoption will grow for sure but
[48:51] it'll grow much faster once people
[48:54] experience some sort of extreme pain
[48:57] that's what I think is going to happen I
[48:58] mean it's uh you can talk you know all
[49:01] day long but most people will not act on
[49:04] it until they start to feel the fire and
[49:09] either they go through like some crazy
[49:11] pain where they lose access to
[49:13] everything like I did you know that
[49:15] that's that for sure will catapult you
[49:18] into into proper self- custody because
[49:20] you now you know what it feels like to
[49:22] have nothing and you know debate whether
[49:24] your life is still worth living so uh
[49:26] it's going to it's going to happen how
[49:28] soon it happens I have no idea
[49:30] fortunately we're seeing a lot more
[49:32] people you know come to their senses
[49:34] when it comes to this maybe not 100% uh
[49:38] living on a Bitcoin standard but they
[49:40] are doing the full self- custody and one
[49:43] thing to keep in mind this whole uh the
[49:46] whole concept of self custody is not
[49:48] isolated or limited to Young Tech folks
[49:51] in fact most of the people that we
[49:53] consult with at the Bitcoin way I'd say
[49:56] m late 50s well into their 880s all
[49:59] right again these are not people that
[50:00] come from Tech backgrounds in fact less
[50:03] than 1% come from Tech backgrounds yes
[50:05] they're may be comfortable on a computer
[50:07] like they understand how to copy paste
[50:10] you know move things into folders and
[50:12] things like this so they're able to
[50:13] follow you know clear and concise
[50:15] instructions but they don't come from a
[50:18] world of tech they come from wherever
[50:21] they come from but now they are so to
[50:25] speak cyber security experts because you
[50:28] know they've opened their minds to
[50:31] learning this information and once they
[50:34] have they are absolutely happy that they
[50:37] did it was in fact one of their best
[50:39] decisions this is I I'm quoting many
[50:42] people that we worked with like this was
[50:44] the best decision I've ever made thank
[50:46] you so much for me that's enough yeah
[50:50] it's all fascinating for me in general
[50:52] Bitcoin and Bitcoin the the age groups
[50:54] because like I'm 25 but but when I look
[50:57] at my statistics and I just pull it up
[50:59] now um it's like under 25 is only 6% of
[51:04] my audience and the average and the
[51:07] biggest group is like around 45 years
[51:09] old so like um it's it's not that
[51:12] Bitcoin is just for like the young crowd
[51:14] or like under 30 years old actually the
[51:16] the biggest crowd that get Bitcoin or
[51:18] like have Bitcoin at least like what I
[51:20] see in my viewership with like I think
[51:22] 10 to 20,000 per week that that look at
[51:25] the podcast uh they are actually 40 45
[51:29] 50 and I even have um above 55 uh 20% of
[51:35] my steers ships like above 55 that's
[51:37] that's really cool it's interesting for
[51:39] me to to see that because like when I
[51:41] first thought about Bitcoin I
[51:44] immediately thought yeah they will be
[51:45] like in my age group then I went to the
[51:47] Bitcoin meetups and I'm like uh 10 years
[51:50] younger than Mo most there like I feel
[51:53] really young in the Bitcoin Community
[51:55] these days well when you reach you like
[51:57] your mid 40s and up you've accumulated a
[52:01] certain amount of wealth right and your
[52:03] amount of savings so for you to lose it
[52:05] you know at 50 and up it's very
[52:08] different from you to lose it when
[52:09] you're 25 I mean at 25 you're still
[52:12] young you know there's a lot more
[52:14] opportunities for you to rebuild
[52:15] yourself versus someone who's a who's
[52:17] you know considerably older I think this
[52:19] is where the the distinction comes in
[52:22] you know and somebody who's you know in
[52:24] well in 60s 70s well obviously you know
[52:26] they've accumul culated um you know
[52:28] whatever amount that they've accumulated
[52:30] but now they need that amount you know
[52:31] they cannot risk losing it because if
[52:33] it's gone where they going to get it
[52:36] from unless you know like Unless somehow
[52:39] they manage to find a job or get back up
[52:42] on their feet which is very
[52:44] unlikely this was again you know it's
[52:47] one of the very painful realities that I
[52:49] had to witness um back in Lebanon when
[52:52] things blew up is that you know I lost a
[52:55] lot of folks that I knew
[52:57] because they just couldn't deal with the
[52:59] pain which is you know again part of
[53:01] that horror movie that I was mentioning
[53:03] this is this is not this not a joke you
[53:05] know this is extremely serious stuff and
[53:08] you also mentioned uh when you talked
[53:10] about that that you found Andreas notop
[53:13] you found Bitcoin it's like a little bit
[53:14] of hope uh that you got from there um
[53:18] what would you say you would right now
[53:20] do without Bitcoin like what what would
[53:23] uh be probably the the best steps right
[53:25] now if they're like would not be any
[53:27] Bitcoin that's a very dangerous question
[53:30] man you know when when you're in a very
[53:32] dark mindset I don't know I don't even
[53:35] want to contemplate answering that
[53:37] question honestly because it uh the the
[53:40] the mere thought of it you know
[53:41] frightens me um if there wasn't Bitcoin
[53:44] you know we at some point I think we and
[53:47] at least a big part of the population
[53:50] would be in Revolt I don't think um the
[53:54] human race at least not all of it was
[53:57] was born to be
[53:58] enslaved you know not everybody's good
[54:02] with you know taking directions from
[54:04] criminals and bullies and thieves right
[54:07] I for one I'm not I would rather die
[54:11] than live you know in a world like this
[54:14] under this type of uh scenario and I'm
[54:17] sure I'm not alone in this so if there
[54:20] wasn't Bitcoin a sort of like a peaceful
[54:23] way you know to arm the people people to
[54:26] retake power back from the corruption it
[54:30] would have to result in war and violence
[54:33] and Rebellion at some stage yeah I also
[54:37] think like that it's like I'm just
[54:39] really glad that it's there and probably
[54:42] if if we would not have Bitcoin at some
[54:44] point hopefully someone else would have
[54:46] created something similar than than
[54:48] Bitcoin um it's like I think it's just a
[54:51] matter of time till there something like
[54:52] that got discovered and I'm glad that it
[54:56] got covered because yeah maybe maybe if
[54:58] it did not was for sat Nakamoto maybe we
[55:01] would not have it for another 100 years
[55:02] something like that I don't know it's a
[55:05] not a good place to look at but it's
[55:06] interesting to think about it of course
[55:08] and it's that Immaculate Conception of
[55:10] Bitcoin that's such a blessing that made
[55:12] this work I mean whoever Satoshi
[55:14] Nakamoto was you know honestly that's
[55:17] why a lot of people um consider Bitcoin
[55:19] almost like a religion because it was
[55:22] almost like a gift from some divine
[55:25] intervention to the world for someone to
[55:28] create something like this and want
[55:31] nothing to do with it because they know
[55:34] that's how it
[55:35] wins man that's that's like that's not I
[55:38] don't like how is that even a human
[55:40] characteristics like you have to be
[55:43] really strong as a and a selfless as a
[55:46] person to do this because you know he
[55:49] has or they have a million Bitcoin like
[55:53] if this person was after money and fame
[55:56] they he'd be like the richest person in
[55:58] the world today right with a million
[56:00] Bitcoin but they're gone and they knew
[56:03] this was going to happen and they did it
[56:06] anyhow for the greater good so this
[56:10] detail cannot be forgotten you know like
[56:13] every day I thank God
[56:17] wherever the Satoshi Nakamoto is you
[56:21] know I pray that they are good if
[56:23] they're still on Earth that they are
[56:25] they're good good and healthy and if
[56:28] they're gone well God bless them and
[56:30] thank
[56:31] you infinity for that gift to restore
[56:36] hope to all of us that had completely
[56:39] lost it at some point in time I reallyu
[56:42] things I think also like that this one
[56:44] million Bitcoin of of his like the first
[56:45] like they they will never move like if
[56:47] if he actually is alive uh the most
[56:50] likely scenario as I think it is like he
[56:53] lost the key on purpose for the first
[56:55] one million and like mine it a little
[56:57] bit and has some like extra stack of
[56:59] like a few 50,000 or something like that
[57:02] um Bitcoin so yeah but it's fun to
[57:05] speculate about that um last question
[57:07] before we get to our end routine what
[57:10] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[57:13] besides cyber security besides self-
[57:14] custody U what what else could we learn
[57:17] from you life is precious man and uh you
[57:20] can't live it very nonchalantly and
[57:23] casually thinking everything's going to
[57:24] be okay simply because it's okay in the
[57:26] moment you know you always have to
[57:29] prepare for for the worst and hope it
[57:32] never happens um the lesson I learned
[57:35] the painful lesson I learned is that
[57:38] without ownership of your money you have
[57:40] no freedom in this in this lifetime you
[57:42] cannot do anything you know if you
[57:44] cannot transact in something of value
[57:47] right and if you don't want to be you
[57:50] know somebody else's you know little
[57:53] little donkey just the way I like to
[57:55] call it well then you have to be you
[57:57] know the uh the master of your own
[57:59] domain and the only way you're going to
[58:00] do this now is you know by holding your
[58:03] money becoming you know the head of
[58:05] security you're you're you're like the
[58:08] the bank now and making sure that
[58:09] everybody that that's attached to you
[58:11] whether you're kid your partner whoever
[58:13] it is they understand the significance
[58:17] of all of this and they do the work as
[58:20] well so that they don't you know
[58:21] inadvertently blow everything up and
[58:23] lose it um later on down the line
[58:25] because you know after we're gone on a
[58:29] Bitcoin standard the world will truly
[58:32] flourish into a utopian work of art in
[58:35] my opinion um hopefully you know I can
[58:38] live long enough to see it at least you
[58:40] know start and uh enjoy some of it but
[58:44] you know in a 100 200 years from now you
[58:47] know whoever will be born during that
[58:49] time will never know what we went
[58:53] through in fact if they ever read it in
[58:55] history
[58:56] they will probably laugh at us as you
[58:58] know the dumbest generation that ever
[59:01] lived to actually think that you know
[59:03] worthless toilet paper controlled by
[59:06] someone else was a good idea I I truly
[59:08] think so too um the tin as you know it
[59:12] is uh before like the the previous guest
[59:14] is asking a question for the next guest
[59:16] without knowing who the next guest
[59:17] actually is um and your question from
[59:19] the previous guest is how can Bitcoin
[59:22] scale do 8 billion people using it as
[59:25] money uh a million dollar question well
[59:27] it certainly won't be on layer one so
[59:30] the Bitcoin you know that people are
[59:32] casually still buying today that's not
[59:34] going to be how it scales it'll likely
[59:36] scale you know on layer two three four
[59:38] Solutions on top you know of of layer
[59:42] one how exactly that happens I don't
[59:45] know but I suspect you know I'm I'm
[59:47] hoping you know that Solutions are going
[59:49] to come about you know a lot quicker now
[59:52] a lot faster now now that it's being
[59:55] legitimized more in in the mainstream
[59:59] you know in uh you know with politicians
[60:01] you know there's a lot of uh there's a
[60:03] lot of eyes and incentives on making
[60:06] this you know like the the path forward
[60:09] so how that what that translates into I
[60:13] don't know there's a lot of projects
[60:14] being worked on right now you know all
[60:15] of them you know are still in
[60:17] development so nothing is really
[60:18] concrete but there's a lot of brilliant
[60:20] ideas you know they come out very
[60:23] regularly about this and so we'll see
[60:25] which one sticks but it's going to be
[60:28] easier to use Bitcoin that's for sure
[60:30] the the complexi of not that it's
[60:32] complex but it'll become a lot simpler
[60:35] than it is already now you know in in
[60:39] the near future and I'm not talking
[60:41] about 10 20 years I'd say maybe within
[60:43] less than five years you know the path
[60:45] to full self- custody will likely take
[60:48] lesser steps than it does now amazing uh
[60:53] it's so fun to talk about that and um uh
[60:56] and I asked so many different uh people
[60:59] already on that and it's it's it will be
[61:01] really fun like at one point I probably
[61:02] write an article a short about like
[61:04] maybe like summarizing some of the
[61:06] opinions and giving him some some
