[00:00] why does it make sense to have hundreds
[00:02] of currencies and Bank closing hours and
[00:04] bank holidays and the stock market is
[00:06] only open for six or 7 hours in the US I
[00:09] mean it's completely ridiculous it's
[00:11] it's just a system from the Stone Age
[00:13] and we really need to bring the monetary
[00:15] system into the digital Global Internet
[00:18] age so the internet really needs its own
[00:20] money and I believe that Bitcoin is our
[00:22] best shot at this we have so much
[00:24] potential from treasuries from high net
[00:26] worth individuals from part of real
[00:28] estate that will flow into Bitcoin from
[00:30] nation states that are building uh
[00:32] Bitcoin
[00:33] reserves I saw your PIN tweet uh and
[00:36] this was amazing because you have a
[00:39] short pin tweet about how many Bitcoin
[00:41] you should own and I talked about that
[00:44] topic with a lot of people already and
[00:46] they have everyone has a different kind
[00:48] of number it kind of all the numbers are
[00:50] between 0.1 and six
[00:54] Bitcoin and I think you chose the number
[00:57] one uh and why do you think it's like
[01:00] one the North Star we should shoot for
[01:02] and yeah why should everyone goal uh to
[01:06] have everyone's goal should be one
[01:08] Bitcoin I mean of course it it depends
[01:11] on on your assumptions and and the
[01:13] calculations that you that you make so
[01:15] in my in my tweet I just ran through the
[01:18] numbers assuming that roughly 4 million
[01:22] Bitcoins have already been lost um of
[01:25] course uh yeah there's a wide range to
[01:28] that but if you count that uh and then
[01:31] if you only take for example the number
[01:34] that there are 63 million millionaires
[01:37] in the world then each millionaire could
[01:40] only get one quarter of a Bitcoin if
[01:44] each one would have the same the same
[01:47] share so um actually if you own more
[01:50] than a quarter of a of a Bitcoin so more
[01:52] than 0.25 you're are already richer than
[01:56] a millionaire could ever be in Bitcoin
[01:58] terms so I think that's already a
[02:01] fantastic Milestone to achieve for for a
[02:04] lot of people um but personally I I
[02:08] tried to calculate how how much would
[02:10] you actually need to potentially uh
[02:13] retire on on your Bitcoin stack and um
[02:17] of course it also depends then on on uh
[02:19] how high you think Bitcoin will go so if
[02:22] you think Bitcoin will go to 10 million
[02:24] then maybe a quarter of a Bitcoin might
[02:26] already be enough depending on on where
[02:29] you live but I think we are still in the
[02:32] time right now where it's um for most at
[02:36] least Western people with a with a
[02:38] normal job with a with a decent paying
[02:40] job I think it's still possible right
[02:42] now to aim for one full Bitcoin to be a
[02:46] whole coiner uh and I think um yeah if
[02:49] if you can uh if you can manage it I
[02:51] think that would be a fantastic
[02:53] Milestone because then you would be four
[02:55] times um as health as wealthy as as a a
[02:59] Bitcoin millionaire could could ever be
[03:02] um so uh yeah I think that's that's a
[03:05] great goal because there will be a time
[03:07] in the future where it won't be as easy
[03:10] as today because right now Bitcoin is
[03:11] roughly 70,000 in the 70s so I think
[03:15] it's still possible for for a decent
[03:18] paying job to to save 70,000 um but you
[03:21] have to be quick probably because the
[03:23] Bull Run is is running uh but once
[03:26] Bitcoin hits I don't know once it will
[03:28] be in the hundreds of thousands of
[03:30] course it will be much more difficult
[03:32] and then I think uh the the good goal to
[03:35] strive for would be a quarter of of a
[03:38] Bitcoin I think that's a that's a
[03:39] fantastic number but of course if you
[03:41] have the means if you already have a big
[03:43] portfolio maybe sold a company maybe um
[03:46] inherited some money then why not um if
[03:49] if uh your portfolio allocations allow
[03:51] it maybe um even by a couple of Bitcoin
[03:54] I think this could be a really fantastic
[03:57] bet in into the future and and uh
[04:00] personally I believe that this will
[04:02] really pay off um handsomely and uh yeah
[04:05] we live in fantastic times right now
[04:08] yeah and it's also interesting because I
[04:09] see now the price shooting up so quickly
[04:11] and usually I pre-record my uh
[04:14] interviews two or three weeks ahead so
[04:17] this will Air uh three weeks in the
[04:20] future it will be interesting to see
[04:22] maybe I don't know what the price is
[04:23] doing in the next three weeks could be
[04:25] crazy could be where it is right now but
[04:28] just as a reminder for everybody this
[04:30] was recorded on March 11 so if the price
[04:33] is now at
[04:35] 250,000 uh this could be changing
[04:38] because if if the price actually shoots
[04:40] up 2x or 3x a lot more people uh one
[04:45] Bitcoin seems more unreachable for a lot
[04:48] of a lot more people and of course it
[04:50] also depends as you said on where you
[04:52] are in your life if you're now starting
[04:54] with 17 years old and you want to get to
[04:57] one Bitcoin and you have nothing on
[04:59] savings and you're just starting out
[05:00] your career obviously one Bitcoin seems
[05:03] far far away in the future uh and but
[05:06] the good thing is like you have the
[05:08] whole life in front of you so you you
[05:11] can stack even now and we have one thing
[05:14] really nicely in common I also was a
[05:17] Tesla investor I think you are still a
[05:19] Tesla investor you post also a lot about
[05:22] Tesla uh and I was a Tesla invest I
[05:24] think till 2021 for like four or five
[05:28] years it paid me really well if you
[05:31] followed Tesla on this time frame you
[05:33] know why um and I loved the Tesla story
[05:38] from the beginning I just from
[05:39] Simplicity standpoints I was like I have
[05:42] to uh get full on in all in Bitcoin I
[05:46] think about just buying one share back
[05:48] of Tesla just to see just to have this
[05:51] symbolic Tesla in my portfolio uh and
[05:54] you're doing startups you're doing
[05:56] businesses and that's why it's so
[05:59] interesting for me your perspective on
[06:01] bitcoin so why do you think uh with all
[06:04] your knowledge in investing in startups
[06:06] and business is Bitcoin Superior to to
[06:09] other invest other
[06:12] Investments yeah where where do we start
[06:14] uh with that I mean it it it all starts
[06:18] with do you actually believe in Bitcoin
[06:21] because in in the end I believe Bitcoin
[06:23] is a belief system it's a little bit
[06:26] like a like a religion because you also
[06:28] have to believe in it um for it to
[06:31] actually become true because if if
[06:34] nobody believed in it then then
[06:35] basically it would it would um yeah
[06:38] crumble down but the nice thing is that
[06:41] we have um yeah we have we have the game
[06:44] theory we have we have all the the
[06:46] monetary system we have the innovation
[06:49] of of the blockchain of course um and of
[06:51] course the the ultimate scarcity and if
[06:54] you believe that more people actually
[06:57] want to own a piece of Bitcoin
[07:00] uh and on the other hand you only have a
[07:02] limited Supply um then um yeah it's
[07:05] economics 101 that the price actually
[07:08] has to go up but uh the question is um
[07:11] with that equation why would actually
[07:14] more people want to own Bitcoin because
[07:17] that's actually the the key question
[07:19] there and um I think it also of course
[07:21] has to do with the with our traditional
[07:24] monetary system we we live in a in a
[07:26] monetary system that is um yeah that is
[07:29] infl thing that is not fixed in Supply
[07:32] where the supply just can go randomly up
[07:34] by by a lot um like we saw in in the
[07:38] pandemic times and um I think this is
[07:42] one of the reasons why um it actually
[07:44] makes make sense to um to hold some some
[07:48] Bitcoin um as as the early bitcoiners um
[07:51] said yeah it's it's probably better to
[07:53] to just hold some in uh in case it
[07:56] catches on um and I think that how I
[08:00] started I I started in
[08:02] 2017 and then I read the uh digital gold
[08:06] the the book about the Bitcoin history
[08:08] and um yeah studied various Bitcoin ogs
[08:13] and basically I I really like asymmetric
[08:16] bets that's why I invested in Tesla also
[08:19] in in 2017 quite early and uh that's why
[08:22] I put part part of my yeah that's why I
[08:25] put a position into into Bitcoin also in
[08:27] 2017 um because I just like the
[08:30] asymmetric nature because the potential
[08:33] downside is always much much lower than
[08:36] the potential upside you can get with
[08:38] such an asymmetric bet for example with
[08:40] with Tesla I still believe that Tesla um
[08:43] has a really good chance to become the
[08:46] most valuable company uh the most
[08:48] valuable public company on Earth and and
[08:50] possibly also the most valuable company
[08:53] per se and that would be more than I
[08:56] think a I don't know 7x or 10x from from
[08:59] here so still I see the potential upside
[09:03] is much much higher than the potential
[09:05] downside and the same I see I see for
[09:07] Bitcoin so with Bitcoin we have the we
[09:10] have the new uh basically financial
[09:12] model we have the new monetary um Supply
[09:15] this Innovation then of course it's not
[09:18] uh it's not confiscate it's completely
[09:21] peer-to-peer um it's decentralized so it
[09:24] it actually has a lot of innovations
[09:27] that um I would actually love to see in
[09:29] the world so basically I'm I see myself
[09:32] as an investor who invests in the future
[09:35] of humanity and uh who invest in
[09:37] Innovation and I believe that if we
[09:40] think about 50 years from now when we
[09:42] will build our first city on Mars will
[09:45] we build there like um Banks and Bank
[09:49] branches and like opening hours from 900
[09:52] a.m. to 4 p.m. and and closed them all
[09:55] the time for bank holidays Etc of course
[09:57] not we will need a money and also in the
[10:01] in the era of the internet um why does
[10:04] it make sense to have I don't know
[10:05] hundreds of currencies and Bank closing
[10:08] hours and bank holidays and all that
[10:10] stuff and the uh the stock market is
[10:13] only open for I don't know six or seven
[10:15] hours in the US I mean it's completely
[10:17] ridiculous it's it's just a a system
[10:20] from the Stone Age and we really need to
[10:23] bring the monetary system into the
[10:25] digital Global Internet age so the
[10:28] internet really needs it its own money
[10:30] and I believe that Bitcoin is our best
[10:32] shot at this and I want to own a piece
[10:35] of it and that's that's why I invested
[10:37] part of it but I would never go all in
[10:40] just one asset there are so many people
[10:42] that are all in Tesla for example or all
[10:45] in Bitcoin the future is never certain
[10:49] and um of course if you only own I don't
[10:52] know $1,000 or ,000 it doesn't matter
[10:55] you can also go all in some me mem coin
[10:58] but if you actually already have like
[11:00] millions in assets I believe it's
[11:02] foolish to risk something that you
[11:05] already have a need for something that
[11:07] you um don't have and potentially even
[11:10] don't need because um it's it's uh it's
[11:13] also a question of when is it enough and
[11:15] and why do you have to um risk basically
[11:18] um yeah bet the farm on on just one
[11:22] asset um in the hopes that it uh that it
[11:24] will go up another 10x or or whatever so
[11:27] basically I'm I am highly con so my two
[11:30] largest positions are in fact Tesla and
[11:32] Bitcoin and um what I like about it that
[11:35] these are basically not correlated so um
[11:39] for for my personal financial situation
[11:42] it's already enough if one of the two
[11:45] succeeds and um for me right now it
[11:47] would be totally fine if Tesla would go
[11:49] bankrupt and would go out of business um
[11:52] because um my my Bitcoin gains more than
[11:55] compensate for it and vice versa um if
[11:57] Bitcoin somehow go goes down or is
[12:00] hacked or or whatever happens um then uh
[12:03] if Tesla then becomes the the most
[12:05] valuable company on Earth then I will be
[12:07] totally fine and it will more than
[12:09] compensate for for my Bitcoin position
[12:11] so basically I advocate for at least two
[12:14] bets um of course you can be highly
[12:16] concentrated but personally I think if
[12:18] you have millions in assets it's foolish
[12:20] to go all in just just one asset yeah
[12:23] and it also has something to do with uh
[12:26] what you already have as you said and
[12:29] maybe also a little bit with the age of
[12:31] course when you're like 20 25 I'm really
[12:33] young uh and I like this was my stand
[12:36] 2021 I had 50% 50% tline
[12:41] Bitcoin and and both are extremely good
[12:44] bets to make I think as you said as
[12:46] magicc BS H what would be interesting to
[12:49] know uh and probably look at it uh look
[12:52] at it similarly um what makes an as
[12:56] asimetric bad for you like do you have
[12:59] some properties you look for do you have
[13:02] some uh things you're like oh this looks
[13:05] like a really really good bet I have to
[13:07] look deeper into that do you have some
[13:10] scheme something in the patterns you
[13:12] look for so originally I I started as a
[13:16] value investor so I studied uh Warren
[13:19] Buffett and Charlie Monger uh really um
[13:21] intensely so I I've studied it for
[13:24] hundreds or or thousands of hours and
[13:26] that gave me a really good foundation
[13:29] for my investing principles um just
[13:32] basic stuff like um earn more than you
[13:34] spend and always um think about the
[13:37] margin of safety think about your
[13:39] portfolio allocations that helped me a
[13:41] lot in my early days and then I read um
[13:44] basically the investing book that is now
[13:47] the foundation of my investing strategy
[13:49] and that's called 100 Baggers by Chris
[13:53] mayor and it basically studies all the
[13:56] companies in the stock market that have
[13:58] at least least done a 100x um and there
[14:02] have been hundreds of such companies and
[14:05] um the book basically is a study where
[14:08] um he tried to find find commonalities
[14:11] and and predictions basically predictive
[14:14] um indicators um what actually makes a
[14:17] 100 bagger um do a 100 uh do a 100 fold
[14:21] increase and actually there have been
[14:23] companies actually the 100 times um
[14:26] companies are um yeah there have been so
[14:29] many companies that did a 10,000 x or a
[14:32] 15,000 x or I think the best one was
[14:34] Burk hadway by Warren Buffett I think
[14:37] it's now at the more than 30,000 x
[14:40] probably or I don't know the current
[14:42] numbers but I think last time I checked
[14:43] it was 27,000 x um so fantastic gains of
[14:48] course over a long period of time and
[14:50] what I learned there is that you need to
[14:53] have an owner operator so that it's of
[14:55] course um focused on on companies but
[14:57] for for the companies you need to have
[14:59] an owner operator so for example like a
[15:01] Elon Musk figure that holds like 10 to
[15:04] 10 20% of the of the company you need to
[15:06] have a really huge Market you need to be
[15:10] profitable already and you need to
[15:11] basically reinvest your profits into
[15:15] this large Market that is untapped um
[15:18] because if you um yeah have a really
[15:20] small Niche and after two years you
[15:22] basically um yeah have um have found all
[15:26] of your um potential customers then you
[15:29] cannot grow anymore and and uh so you
[15:32] need to have a really really big market
[15:34] and I would um assume that um the market
[15:37] for Tesla for example is one of the
[15:39] largest markets that you can actually
[15:42] imagine because it's not only the
[15:43] automotive Market it's also AI it's
[15:46] robotics it's the whole autonomous
[15:49] driving it's uh the energy sector so
[15:52] it's trillions and trillions tens of
[15:54] trillions possibly hundreds of trillions
[15:56] of Market size and that's actually what
[15:59] What's um what's so special and if you
[16:01] have this Market with combined with a
[16:04] Visionary leader combined with a great
[16:06] product that is already profitable that
[16:08] is growing nicely that has good customer
[16:10] reviews Etc then you have this um money
[16:14] machine or you have this snowball that
[16:16] just keeps getting bigger and bigger and
[16:19] um if you then wait um for I think on
[16:22] average it took 24 years for such a
[16:25] company to become a 100 bagger then you
[16:27] can just let it it run as long as the
[16:30] story is intact and and that's also the
[16:33] selling strategy so the selling strategy
[16:34] is you just buy and hold as long as this
[16:38] story stays the same so as long as the
[16:41] products are good as long as the founder
[16:43] is still at the company as long as the
[16:45] market is still large you just hold
[16:47] basically for decades and then
[16:49] eventually you wake up and you have a
[16:51] thousand bagger or 10,000 bagger Etc and
[16:54] in the meantime you didn't have to do
[16:56] any trading you didn't have to do any um
[16:59] yeah fancy spreadsheets or or something
[17:02] once you have the conviction once you
[17:03] spend the hundreds or thousands of hours
[17:05] that's actually needed to to get this
[17:07] conviction then you can just buy and
[17:09] hold for decades and I really love this
[17:12] um investing strategy because at heart I
[17:15] am really lazy um but not only lazy I'm
[17:18] I'm not a Trader so I don't want to be
[17:20] in front of the computer the whole day
[17:22] it it doesn't make sense for me people
[17:24] who trade 24/7 and basically don't have
[17:27] a life anymore I want to live I want to
[17:29] have a good life and I want the
[17:31] Investments to basically serve me and
[17:33] not me serving my my investing so so
[17:37] that's what attracted me to the 100 bger
[17:39] strategy and I actually believe that
[17:42] Bitcoin even though it's not a company
[17:44] actually resembles exactly this so we
[17:47] have a a great founder figure we have
[17:49] satosi Nakamoto we have a great product
[17:52] uh we have um a good growth um we have a
[17:56] huge total addressable markets also so
[17:59] hundreds of of trillions in in potential
[18:01] wealth um that that could be sucked in
[18:04] here um so it it meets actually all of
[18:07] these criteria and and that's why I
[18:09] included it in my in my uh portfolio and
[18:12] um I believe it it it totally makes
[18:14] sense for me yeah it's an amazing story
[18:17] and I think this H Baggers are always
[18:20] shot for that also uh when I starting
[18:23] investing I I experienced with dividend
[18:26] investing experienc with so many
[18:28] different
[18:29] but in the end of the day I was like I
[18:32] want to bet and you said it so so
[18:35] beautifully uh I want to bet on the
[18:37] future I want to see uh and in companies
[18:40] and Innovation drivers that do exactly
[18:44] that so Tesla was a no-brainer for me
[18:46] Bitcoin is a no-brainer for me uh yeah
[18:49] it's it's it's amazing assuming this
[18:51] just came up in my my mind assuming Sosi
[18:54] Nakamoto is a person just one person one
[18:57] man whatever um and he has a lot of
[19:01] wealth already with 1 million Bitcoin
[19:03] and when Bitcoin continues to rise as we
[19:05] think it will do uh he will be a really
[19:08] really really wealthy person and then we
[19:11] have also El musk who has Tesla SpaceX
[19:13] twitter so many different uh things
[19:16] going for him that are just working um
[19:20] and he also has Bitcoin I think
[19:22] personally he owns Bitcoin Tesla owns
[19:24] Bitcoin I think he will own more Bitcoin
[19:27] in the future and he will buy more in
[19:29] the future um who do you think has the
[19:32] best shot to become the first
[19:33] trillionaire of the
[19:36] world yeah that's a really that's a
[19:38] really good question so originally I I
[19:40] thought about it a couple of years ago
[19:42] and I already then tweeted um that it
[19:45] will be a race um between Elon Musk
[19:47] satos yakamoto and possibly Jeff Bezos
[19:51] um I thought at the time and um right
[19:54] now I I think it's it's a race between
[19:56] Elon and and Satoshi and
[19:59] personally it's it's it really depends
[20:02] on basically luck at at this point I I I
[20:05] would I would say I mean Elon is is a
[20:07] little bit up front I think um I don't
[20:09] know the exact numbers but roughly 250
[20:11] billion I think Satoshi if you count the
[20:14] the 7 2,000 that we are right now it's
[20:17] roughly 72 billion so it's it's roughly
[20:20] a 3X um uh difference uh so um I I would
[20:25] actually say that um Elon possibly has
[20:28] has better chance because Tesla only
[20:30] needs like uh uh achieve the full
[20:33] self-driving or or yeah make make a a
[20:36] good breakthrough that people actually
[20:38] see that that it will happen which which
[20:40] might happen with the with the FSD
[20:43] version 12 that's that they are already
[20:45] um in U that they have in roll out um
[20:48] and if that happens then Tesla can 4X um
[20:51] really easily um like we saw with with
[20:54] Nvidia uh that that did a five or 6X in
[20:57] in just 12 12 months mons I think that
[20:59] something similar could could easily
[21:01] happen happen to Tesla if if they have
[21:04] the uh the the the back WIS uh in their
[21:07] in their favor so so if something goes
[21:10] right or they launch their their new
[21:12] model model two and and this goes ahead
[21:15] of schedule or or just something needs
[21:17] to happen um and and Tesla will will
[21:19] actually really be worth many many
[21:21] trillions in in my opinion so I think
[21:23] Elon right now has a head start but
[21:26] depending on of course how this full
[21:28] markets uh will will go with regards to
[21:31] to bitcoin I mean if we um actually see
[21:34] something anything um close to 2017 then
[21:38] um we we might already be there uh this
[21:41] this cycle right and and satosi could
[21:43] already in theory become a trillionaire
[21:46] this cycle if we shoot up to half a
[21:48] million or a million I don't know what
[21:49] the what the number uh then would be uh
[21:52] yeah it would need to be like a what is
[21:54] it a 13 13x from here if he's at 70
[21:57] billion right so
[22:00] uh yeah what what would that be um 700
[22:03] yeah maybe roughly maybe roughly uh no
[22:05] it it it would have to be exactly one
[22:06] one million right one one million coins
[22:08] times times a million would be roughly a
[22:11] trillion so so it would have to actually
[22:13] hit hit 1 million so um it's it's a
[22:16] little bit a long shot for for this
[22:18] cycle I I would I would assume but
[22:20] nothing is impossible if you actually
[22:22] compare to 2017 I think a million could
[22:24] actually happen um if if if a similar
[22:27] squeeze happen happens now with the with
[22:29] the ETFs and everything um but um yeah
[22:32] if not this cycle then then probably
[22:34] next cycle but it will be a tough rise
[22:36] and I think it will be between the two
[22:38] of them what what do you think it's
[22:40] interesting because um s nakoto has one
[22:44] big disadvantage he cannot be productive
[22:47] at least as long as we don't know his
[22:50] his his um uh identity so ill mask has
[22:55] the advantage to being able to adopt uh
[22:59] Bitcoin on the balance sheet and on top
[23:01] of that being productive and having
[23:03] additional Revenue playing into this so
[23:06] uh long term uh depending on where he
[23:09] goes with his stance on bitcoin because
[23:11] he has been on all over the place
[23:15] publicly with his STS on bitcoin and
[23:17] then all of also this was this the
[23:19] shitcoin phase with Dogecoin and all
[23:22] this stuff um so depending on like it
[23:26] the ball is in ill M Corners I think he
[23:29] he can he can do it uh sat Nakamoto will
[23:33] rise no matter what he he cannot do
[23:35] something more to it towards it he
[23:37] cannot do something less towards it uh I
[23:40] mean there are also a lot of things that
[23:41] like people like is Sosi Nakamoto
[23:46] actually owning that 1 million maybe
[23:49] it's locked maybe like there are so many
[23:51] theories around that uh around how and
[23:55] also then there is the question how many
[23:56] Bitcoin actually does uh IL Musk own
[23:59] personally uh I heard an interview where
[24:02] he was asked about Dogecoin and Bitcoin
[24:04] and then he clarified in one sentence
[24:06] that he owns way more Bitcoin than
[24:09] Dogecoin personally so I guess he could
[24:12] easily have a few billions maybe in in
[24:15] in Bitcoin maybe not I don't know uh but
[24:19] this all speculations so there's so many
[24:21] speculations in there but those are the
[24:23] those are the two people maybe people uh
[24:27] that are in the race it will be
[24:28] interesting to see and on the top of
[24:30] topic of of of e musk and Mas do you
[24:34] think we uh and this is a technical
[24:37] question also that is above my head uh I
[24:40] don't know if you uh thought about that
[24:42] uh do we think when we colonize masss
[24:44] and being on masss will Bitcoin have a
[24:46] chance to being a multi uh also a
[24:50] currency on masss not only on Earth an
[24:53] acid not only on Earth also on
[24:56] mass I think why not Al also thought
[24:59] about it but I I don't know the exact um
[25:02] what it would mean technically because
[25:04] of course Mars I think in the in the
[25:07] worst case I think it's a 20 minute
[25:09] round trip with regards to to data
[25:12] exchange with with the Earth so I think
[25:14] it's 10 minutes one way and 10 minutes
[25:16] the other way um I think it cannot be
[25:18] faster because it's the it's the speed
[25:20] speed of light and it it cannot be
[25:22] faster so um we would have some kind of
[25:25] a sinking issue and and uh Network issue
[25:29] maybe but um yeah I'm no technician I'm
[25:32] I'm no engineer but but I don't see a
[25:34] reason why we shouldn't be able to solve
[25:37] that somehow and I would actually love
[25:39] to see um Bitcoin actually not only
[25:42] becoming um Earth digital money but
[25:45] actually the money of of our Sol system
[25:48] or actually the money of humanity if if
[25:50] we think even even broader because
[25:53] hopefully um humans will become a
[25:56] multi-planet species and hopefully also
[25:59] multi solar system species one day and
[26:02] um yeah it would be fantastic if if
[26:04] Bitcoin would actually be the the
[26:06] backbone of of all of this but yeah it
[26:08] it would actually be a great question
[26:10] maybe you you one day do a podcast with
[26:12] with a Bitcoin developer or core
[26:14] developer so you can you could actually
[26:16] ask him or her um yeah what it what it
[26:20] would actually mean technically to to
[26:22] sync it between planets yeah I think I
[26:25] heard one podcast about that already uh
[26:28] I think that definitely needs to be a
[26:30] change in the code I think that that we
[26:32] definitely have to do something about
[26:34] that uh but like it's it's if Bitcoin is
[26:38] just uh the world Reserve asset on this
[26:41] planet it's it's already really
[26:43] successful so uh that's good and what
[26:46] actually uh before we move on I had one
[26:48] more question for you you are now not
[26:50] fully in Bitcoin and you also talked
[26:53] about that you want to to spread the
[26:55] risk not betting on one whole thing and
[26:59] you probably um like you're in another
[27:03] in a different stage of life than than
[27:05] me I'm like 25 if I lose everything
[27:07] tomorrow I will be like every 25 year
[27:10] old so for me really that really does
[27:13] not matter uh that much so that's why I
[27:16] can do that what I'm doing uh and I'm
[27:19] aware of that but is there anything that
[27:22] could happen uh to bitcoin to Tesla to
[27:25] other Investments of yours that you
[27:27] would be like oh I have to go all in or
[27:31] nearly all in with like 90% Plus in
[27:34] Bitcoin is there anything you can
[27:35] imagine that is like now I have to do it
[27:38] no I I don't think so because um I think
[27:41] it could happen but then it would happen
[27:43] organically because that's the uh the
[27:46] beauty or or the the downside however
[27:49] you you put it of of my investing
[27:51] strategy of of the 100 bager strategy
[27:53] that you will always have just a couple
[27:55] of Investments or one or two Investments
[27:58] that in the end over a long time period
[28:01] make up all of your portfolio because
[28:03] they basically won uh won the the the
[28:05] lottery of of being a 100 bagger so if
[28:08] Bitcoin really now goes to 500k then of
[28:11] course um it it will be the the absolute
[28:13] largest position in in my portfolio but
[28:17] then I would actually also rebalance a
[28:19] little bit because then it would be um
[28:21] basically um so much uh yeah so much
[28:24] money for me that it would just be
[28:26] foolish to um write through another bare
[28:29] Market or right through another cycle um
[28:32] so I have actually implemented right now
[28:34] uh basically a dollar co uh dollar cost
[28:37] selling strategy where I basically sell
[28:40] on the way up because I never know you
[28:42] never know where the top is so I just
[28:44] made an Excel sheet and and I'm
[28:47] basically I already actually started um
[28:50] be yeah for for personal financial
[28:51] reasons I need to um fill up fill up my
[28:54] cash Reserve um I already started just a
[28:57] little bit the higher the Bitcoin price
[28:59] goes the more basically I will sell but
[29:02] of course I will never sell everything I
[29:04] will always have have a stash that I
[29:06] that I intend to keep for for decades
[29:08] because I'm really in the camp of of
[29:10] Michael sailor um I really believe that
[29:13] this will yeah go up um for for decades
[29:16] or or has the possibility to go up for
[29:18] decades or at least in the next 10 years
[29:21] as he puts it the will be the the new
[29:23] Gold Rush and I I really um yeah it
[29:26] makes sense to me um so at least for the
[29:28] next 10 years I I will always have a
[29:30] good part of of my Bitcoins that I will
[29:33] still hold but then I also I I just I
[29:36] also don't only invest in in Native
[29:38] Bitcoins because it's for me it's too
[29:41] risky to to have everything in in self-
[29:43] custody um I I actually have the large
[29:46] the largest part of my Bitcoins in in
[29:47] micro strategy I also have a good part
[29:50] in um Bitcoin miners like like clean
[29:52] spark so I I I spread it out also within
[29:55] the the Bitcoin ecosystem and actually
[29:57] right now um micro strategy actually is
[29:59] is massively outperforming Bitcoin so
[30:02] right now they are trading at a premium
[30:04] of more than
[30:05] 40% um based on their Bitcoin stash so I
[30:10] actually made um yeah a profit of of
[30:12] more than 40% um and you compare it
[30:15] dollar for dollar um compared to to
[30:17] Native Bitcoins so so that is that is
[30:20] going well and um yeah I I would I would
[30:24] I think never hold 100% in in one asset
[30:27] I always want to have a a good cash
[30:29] reserve and I always want to have um at
[30:32] least two two bets that I'm that I'm
[30:35] banking on but actually my favorite
[30:37] scenario I think would now be and
[30:39] because Tesla is somewhat um the
[30:41] momentum is somewhat negative a lot of
[30:43] fud a lot of uh negative um commentary
[30:46] about Elon Etc because Tesla is between
[30:49] two growth um uh phases um yeah because
[30:54] they will start production with of the
[30:56] of the model 2 Etc the autonomy is is uh
[31:00] is right in front in front of us but not
[31:02] quite there yet so my favorite um
[31:05] actually would be that Bitcoin now runs
[31:08] up faster we maybe see a huge bull
[31:11] market in the hundreds of thousands of
[31:13] dollars and then I would take some
[31:14] profits and if I then would have enough
[31:17] time to redeploy it into Tesla while
[31:19] still being cheap and then I can do
[31:21] another 10x with Tesla that would be my
[31:23] absolute dream scenario so um yeah we'll
[31:27] see uh what I will do about that but I
[31:30] cannot imagine um a scenario where I
[31:33] would go um initially 90% of all of my
[31:36] assets into into just one asset um yeah
[31:39] personally it doesn't make sense because
[31:40] the future is never certain I mean you
[31:42] can always um yeah we can always talk
[31:46] about 50 arguments why Bitcoin has to go
[31:49] up but there is always a potential Black
[31:51] Swan there's always something can always
[31:54] happen the future is not 100% guaranteed
[31:56] and even if it's just 99% guaranteed
[31:59] it's still a 1% chance that you are
[32:01] completely W wiped out so um yeah I
[32:04] would actually um say it as as you as
[32:07] you say it um if you are young of course
[32:09] you can afford it to to be Allin you can
[32:12] actually also afford to take a little
[32:14] bit of of Leverage you can also afford
[32:16] to trade altcoins in in the hopes that
[32:19] you will have more more Bitcoin that is
[32:21] all fine if you um if you are young and
[32:24] you can make back the money but if you
[32:26] already yeah start companies sold
[32:29] companies like like I did um I think it
[32:31] would be foolish to to Really bet my
[32:33] whole Farm on on just one asset and uh
[32:37] yeah that's why I'm a little bit more
[32:38] conservative but um I would actually say
[32:41] that I'm still um taking a lot of risks
[32:43] of course with my with my strategy with
[32:45] with Tesla with with Bitcoin and because
[32:47] I see the upside so I think I'm still an
[32:49] aggressive enterprising investor but I
[32:52] also have to be really careful because I
[32:54] have a family to take care of um and I
[32:56] don't want to lose what I what I have so
[32:58] I'm a little bit on the on the cautious
[33:00] side 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day
[33:03] one and they teach and preach self-
[33:06] custody this is my goto exchange when
[33:09] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[33:12] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[33:14] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[33:17] fees Plus at the same time support this
[33:20] podcast use code Robin and click the
[33:23] link in the description and that's uh
[33:25] really understandable and I think this
[33:26] is also something never noted in my uh
[33:30] podcast and I want to note it right now
[33:32] because I'm 25 as I said before if I
[33:35] lose everything tomorrow I can move back
[33:38] to my parents I can do stuff like uh I'm
[33:41] 25 I have a girlfriend but I don't have
[33:43] a wife I don't have children that I have
[33:46] to care for I I don't have a company to
[33:49] run I started now my U being
[33:51] self-employed but it's just me so it's
[33:55] just me to to to to feed uh so I have an
[33:59] portfolio where I'm like I can go all in
[34:02] on bitcoin if I would have a company
[34:05] where there are employees involved if I
[34:06] had a family where there are one two
[34:08] three five kids involved if I had a wife
[34:11] like um this would be such a different
[34:13] story and I just wanted to make that
[34:15] sure that I also said that once on my
[34:17] podcast because I'm always really
[34:20] pushing on on bitcoin and I see that
[34:22] actually most of my listeners are older
[34:25] than me as so most of my listeners are
[34:27] like 30 5 sometimes in like 40 uh like
[34:31] uh I even have listeners over 65 which
[34:34] amazes me that uh old people are willing
[34:37] to listen to Young people and want to
[34:39] learn also from the uh New Generation
[34:41] which is amazing shout out to everyone
[34:43] that is over 65 and listening to me uh
[34:46] thank you for that uh so I think this is
[34:49] important to note this your personal
[34:51] situation should be considered before
[34:54] doing anything with money uh and yeah
[34:57] another n less I would I would still be
[34:59] really aggressive as you are uh in
[35:02] Bitcoin and maybe other bets and I think
[35:05] also also to two additional points so
[35:06] you asked me why I'm not going all in
[35:10] and of course um it it depends on the
[35:12] financial situation but also if you then
[35:15] think about Bitcoin becoming really
[35:18] successful then it will actually um eat
[35:21] itself into the whole economy right so
[35:24] even if you then are holding the S&P 500
[35:27] at one point micro strategy will be part
[35:29] of the S&P 500 so everyone that holds
[35:32] the S&P 500 um ETF will automatically
[35:35] basically hold indirectly Bitcoin um if
[35:38] Tesla is really successful and um they
[35:41] are printing um billions and billions in
[35:43] in profits and don't know what to do
[35:45] with the cash because they cannot
[35:46] reinvest at such a fast pace then of
[35:48] course they will hopefully think about
[35:51] deploying some of their treasury into
[35:53] Bitcoin so a lot of companies will
[35:54] deploy the treasury or part of the
[35:56] treasury into Bitcoin so it will eat
[35:59] itself into the economy and at one point
[36:01] you cannot really distinguish um what is
[36:04] um Bitcoin and what is non-bitcoin
[36:06] because it will it will basically become
[36:08] become one at one points that's that's
[36:10] the one uh thing I wanted to mention and
[36:13] uh uh yeah what what was the other point
[36:16] I I I lost my train of thought maybe
[36:18] maybe I come back to that to it but I
[36:20] think that is really important so even
[36:22] if you um are just an S&P 500 or regular
[36:26] index um investor at one point you will
[36:29] have Bitcoin in your retirement account
[36:31] and you will also have it in your in
[36:34] your stock um ETFs and the other point
[36:36] now I I remembered it um is that um of
[36:40] course you are now looking at it from
[36:42] the perspective of a of a young person
[36:44] because you are in the mindset of a 25
[36:46] year old but um I have a lot of friends
[36:49] that are multi-millionaires that have
[36:52] created large companies sold them for
[36:54] hundreds of millions and um a lot of
[36:57] them have 0% Bitcoin allocation and a
[37:00] lot of high net worth individuals have
[37:03] 0% or or just minuscule um Bitcoin
[37:06] allocations and I know a lot of older
[37:08] people 60 70 80 years old that that own
[37:12] real estate and a lot of assets and that
[37:15] basically have a 0% Bitcoin allocation
[37:18] so we can also think about it from the
[37:19] other side what if now thanks to Black
[37:23] Rock and the spot ETFs we would just see
[37:27] a zero .5% allocation of the high net
[37:29] worth individuals what if we would see a
[37:31] 1% or a 3% or whatever um however you
[37:35] might um um see it um allocation then it
[37:39] it would actually make Bitcoins um yeah
[37:42] basically market cap um so much bigger
[37:45] so and even the people that are already
[37:47] invested so if you count um I mean
[37:50] depending on the on the on the estimates
[37:53] um there are yeah up to 400 million
[37:56] Bitcoin owners
[37:58] but each of those owners um if they have
[38:01] a lot of assets like real estate they
[38:03] could easily 10x their allocation into
[38:06] Bitcoin so there is so much potential
[38:09] even from people that right now have
[38:12] 0.1% of of their wealth in in Bitcoin
[38:14] they can 10x it to 1% and it would be a
[38:17] huge difference so so you you have to
[38:20] always see um yeah um have a look at the
[38:23] at the whole market and there are so
[38:25] many wealthy people around and older
[38:28] people that didn't want to create a a
[38:30] coinbase account or a kraken account or
[38:32] whatever and right now they can with the
[38:34] with a click of button or even more
[38:37] realistically with the with just a phone
[38:40] call to their adviser they can now
[38:42] deploy part of their retirement account
[38:45] or part of their stock market portfolio
[38:47] into Bitcoin and I think that's what's
[38:49] the real Beauty about this Bitcoin spot
[38:52] ETFs because a lot of people asked why
[38:54] do we need SP Bitcoin spot ETFs because
[38:57] all everyone can open in 2 minutes A
[38:59] coinbase account Etc but that's not true
[39:01] um look at how 70 or 80 year olds are
[39:05] using the internet they don't want to
[39:07] create new accounts they are overwhelmed
[39:09] but they know how to use their stock
[39:12] market portfolio and uh that's really
[39:14] the the beauty of of the of the spot
[39:16] ETFs it just opens such a huge market
[39:19] and um yeah if you also compare it with
[39:21] with micro strategy with Michael sailor
[39:24] he he um famously talked about it that
[39:27] he needed to do six months of of
[39:29] research and talking with lawyers and
[39:31] and uh um yeah managing his his custody
[39:35] and thinking about a custody strategy
[39:37] and it took really a lot of effort to
[39:39] deploy a treasury strategy and then we
[39:42] had this accounting rule that was not
[39:44] favorable for for Bitcoin holding and
[39:46] now we have the fastb rule changed um we
[39:49] now have Bitcoin spot ETFs so actually
[39:52] companies um are already most companies
[39:54] are already um able to to just buy
[39:56] stocks and their Treasury and and right
[39:59] now with the fastb rules you you you are
[40:01] not penalized um for holding Bitcoin and
[40:03] you can actually make it um yeah much
[40:05] much easier by buying micro strategy or
[40:07] buying some some Bitcoin spot ETF so we
[40:10] have so much potential from treasuries
[40:12] from high netw worth individuals from
[40:14] part of real estate that will flow into
[40:16] Bitcoin from nation states that will
[40:19] that are now building hopefully or or
[40:21] even more are building Bitcoin reserves
[40:24] so so there are so many good um yeah
[40:27] headwinds um or or Tailwinds actually
[40:29] for for for Bitcoin to to um eat itself
[40:32] into the whole economy um so um yeah at
[40:35] one point it will be actually difficult
[40:37] to distinguish um uh what part of the
[40:40] economy is actually Bitcoin and what
[40:42] part is is off Bitcoin and that's the
[40:44] beauty of it right if if Bitcoin
[40:46] succeeds and Bitcoin is that sound money
[40:48] that we think it is and it will grow in
[40:50] the economy and will be like kind of a
[40:52] base layer for our financial system then
[40:54] even the last person getting into
[40:56] Bitcoin and will benefit from it because
[40:59] it will better our systems how do you
[41:01] actually um I think a lot of uh stock
[41:05] investors that don't have any Bitcoin
[41:07] like they are just in the stock market
[41:09] they are always in still in this kind of
[41:12] feeld and dollar mindset and I had all
[41:16] range of guests already on some are
[41:18] saying the dollar will never go away we
[41:20] always have feared currencies and
[41:22] Bitcoin is just a part of that then I
[41:25] have guess on that say Bitcoin like
[41:28] dollar will like Fiat currencies will go
[41:31] away in the next five to 10 years all
[41:33] range of of Gess how do you see the
[41:35] whole uh system playing out and
[41:37] obviously it's highly speculative
[41:38] because we don't know what happens and
[41:40] there's so much more going on uh but how
[41:42] do you see feat and and Bitcoin uh
[41:46] playing and do you see feed surviving
[41:48] over the next 100
[41:50] years I think over a long enough time
[41:53] frame all Fiat currencies die and
[41:56] actually also all na States die and but
[41:59] then we have to go um over hundreds and
[42:01] and possibly thousands of years but I I
[42:03] really think and I think that's the
[42:05] mistake of of all the gold bugs um they
[42:08] always think and if you listen to to
[42:10] people like Peter shiff and and other
[42:12] doomsday people they always think like
[42:14] the the the collapse is is tomorrow and
[42:18] um actually at one point I I also
[42:21] listened a lot to these people it was
[42:23] actually in the financial crisis of of
[42:25] 2008 um where
[42:27] it actually looked like that everything
[42:29] would be imploding and that um Fiat
[42:32] would go away and and everything
[42:34] basically reset would would happen and I
[42:37] actually started to believe that because
[42:39] I I listened too much to to people like
[42:41] Peter shiff and then at one point um
[42:44] couple of years later I just realized um
[42:47] these things even though they are
[42:50] inferior and even though they at one
[42:53] point of course will um go away um I
[42:57] think it's it's like this famous famous
[42:59] quote that the market can stay
[43:01] irrational longer that you can remain
[43:03] solvent and I think it's it's a little
[43:06] bit similar to Fiat currencies so Fiat
[43:08] currencies can survive longer than you
[43:12] might believe that's that's my that's my
[43:13] personal belief so I don't think that
[43:15] the dollar will go away in the next five
[43:17] or 10 years I think um it's still a
[43:20] strong currency of course it's debased
[43:22] um but the government still has a lot of
[43:24] power over it and I don't think they
[43:26] will um relinquish this power easily but
[43:29] there will um come a day where there
[43:32] will be a huge like power struggle
[43:34] between Bitcoin and and Fiat currencies
[43:37] and I think um of course uh the old
[43:40] system won't just go away without a
[43:43] fight I I think we are in front um we
[43:46] have the fight in front of us where um
[43:49] the governments right now um yeah they
[43:51] still laugh a little bit at at Bitcoin
[43:53] um but at one point they really will
[43:56] start seeing the danger and really will
[43:58] will start feeling threatened and then I
[44:01] think they will go into overdrive and
[44:03] where they start attx it to death or try
[44:07] to ban it or or whatever I I think this
[44:09] fight is still in front of us but on the
[44:12] other hand we also have um every every
[44:14] year we have millions more people tens
[44:16] of millions more people and because
[44:18] Bitcoin as Michael sailor says Bitcoin
[44:20] is actually from the people for the
[44:22] people and what is the government
[44:24] government also consists of people and
[44:26] what is um um Etc what are banks they
[44:29] also consist of people and at one point
[44:31] we will have enough um Bitcoin holders
[44:34] basically in these old systems that um
[44:38] it will hopefully um eat eat away at at
[44:41] the power and hopefully um yeah uh make
[44:44] it that that Bitcoin wins wins in the
[44:46] end without without the huge casualties
[44:49] in in the big fight but I don't think
[44:51] that the that the governments and and
[44:54] the central banks will will just uh
[44:57] relinquish their power with without a
[44:58] huge fight so it I think it will be
[45:01] really we live in the most interesting
[45:03] times and I think the next decades will
[45:05] be really uh really interesting but we
[45:08] also have to be realistic I mean Bitcoin
[45:10] right now has been around for 15 years
[45:12] and we are still at day one I mean even
[45:15] the the user interface the uh yeah it's
[45:19] it's it's all still it it feels like the
[45:21] internet in in 1997 so it's it's still
[45:25] really early a lot still has to be built
[45:28] and a lot of adoption has to happen but
[45:31] I think um yeah um as as the saying goes
[45:34] that the the price is actually the best
[45:36] content marketing for Bitcoin so if we
[45:39] will now um see um many more alltime
[45:42] highs then we will see a lot more um
[45:45] press um attention and and media
[45:47] attention and a lot more people will
[45:49] will flood into Bitcoin and the more
[45:51] people we have the easier it will be for
[45:54] us to to then uh yeah survive this big
[45:57] fight that is that is coming up in my
[45:59] opinion yeah and also when the price is
[46:01] coming up and this bll cycle really
[46:03] really starts to to get going uh this
[46:06] has so many different uh consequences
[46:09] because it's not only more people coming
[46:11] into Bitcoin with more people coming
[46:13] into Bitcoin there are also more people
[46:15] that are investing in people in in in
[46:18] Bitcoin companies than in bit in Bitcoin
[46:21] infrastructure in in layers Solutions
[46:23] and in interfaces and in yeah things
[46:26] that we we just need like uh I'm always
[46:29] uh layer one Maxi like I uh I'm not as
[46:34] educated as many other people in in the
[46:35] scene about layer two layer three
[46:38] Technologies and how this all will go
[46:39] because I'm the uh of of 100% confidence
[46:43] that the layer one is beautiful and
[46:45] really elegant uh and on top of that the
[46:48] free market can decide what applications
[46:50] is perfect and also Layer Two
[46:53] application to bitcoin is a Bitcoin ETF
[46:55] or micro strategy you could argue that
[46:57] is also a layer two solution to to
[46:59] bitcoin kind of uh and then there's
[47:01] lightning there's fent there's liquid
[47:03] there are so many things going on on top
[47:05] of Bitcoin and I don't know about all of
[47:09] them and and I don't understand them in
[47:11] deep but it does not matter in the end
[47:13] of the day it matters that people are
[47:15] building those it matters that people
[47:17] are willing to do that that work and do
[47:19] that research uh but in the end of the
[47:21] day we have a base layer and everything
[47:24] that will buildt on top of that comes
[47:27] back to the base layer if micro strategy
[47:29] buys Bitcoin it the value flows back in
[47:32] the base layer if blackrook buys Bitcoin
[47:35] for the clients it flows back in the
[47:37] base layer so that's the important part
[47:39] for me um to switch gears uh I also uh
[47:45] heard about uh your life and and your
[47:48] approach to life in other podcasts and
[47:51] I'm really interested in that because
[47:53] especially when there's as you said what
[47:55] a time to be alive it's so so exciting
[47:57] and I'm basically working all day long
[48:00] and I love it and I don't see it as work
[48:03] uh but there's always this risk to like
[48:04] burnouts to do too much uh and uh you
[48:08] also talk about minimalism that in your
[48:10] life you had a burnout uh and uh I'm
[48:14] really curious how how this changed your
[48:17] view on life and money and how you think
[48:20] about how this all uh is is related to
[48:23] each other and and What discovery you
[48:25] made there
[48:27] yeah I think one realization that I had
[48:31] is that there is an asset that's even
[48:34] more valuable than Bitcoin and it's
[48:36] actually your own lifetime or or your um
[48:41] yeah the minutes that you that you have
[48:43] left or even if you if you condense it
[48:45] more down it's it's actually your high
[48:48] energy um time that you have left
[48:51] because um if you're tired if if you're
[48:53] sick and then yeah you don't have the
[48:57] same outlook on life as as if you are
[48:59] fully energized and can concentrate or
[49:01] something so actually the the minutes
[49:04] per day where you can fully concentrate
[49:06] or something and are feeling energized
[49:09] um this is actually the scarcest um um
[49:12] asset there is um for for each human
[49:14] being um at least that's that's how I
[49:16] see it um so I I always go back and
[49:19] forth because I of course I'm I'm
[49:22] passionate about these these topics and
[49:24] I'm passionate about um technology about
[49:26] the future future of humanity and I can
[49:28] get completely lost in Bitcoin I can get
[49:31] lost in in Tesla and and Elon Musk
[49:33] Universe um but at the end of the day
[49:36] you always have to take a step back and
[49:39] um yeah re-evaluate your life and and
[49:43] always um because we are not only
[49:46] investors monetary investors we are
[49:49] first and foremost investors of our own
[49:53] time and I think um this I actually
[49:57] um yeah if if if I look at back at my
[49:59] own history and if I look at the people
[50:01] around me I think we are really bad
[50:04] investors um with regards to our own
[50:07] time we may be good investors um in
[50:09] terms of money but we are really we
[50:12] really suck at investing our own time um
[50:15] we sleep too little we uh spend too much
[50:18] time in front of the screen we spend too
[50:19] much time refreshing the Bitcoin price
[50:22] we spend too much time looking at charts
[50:24] or whatever or we spend too much time
[50:27] listening to the same argument for the
[50:29] 500th time on on YouTube and things like
[50:32] that it's in my opinion really a waste
[50:35] of time um for for for the most part um
[50:38] uh and yeah it's for me it's it's always
[50:42] it's it's a work in progress I I don't
[50:44] say I I have a a solution for that but I
[50:47] always try to go back a step and
[50:49] re-evaluate Um how my week is going how
[50:52] my months are going um because the older
[50:54] you get the the faster the time runs so
[50:57] right now the weeks are feel like days
[50:59] in 20 years ago and uh uh the months
[51:03] feel like weeks so so the years really
[51:06] go by really fast and um personally I
[51:09] really have uh the ambition to live a
[51:12] good life to not waste my life uh so
[51:16] what what really helps me so I do a lot
[51:17] of personal development um I also
[51:21] started uh participating in studies with
[51:24] psychedelic
[51:25] substances so last year I did a study
[51:28] with synthetic ayahuaska um six sessions
[51:32] and this year actually right now
[51:34] tomorrow I I have my next study day um I
[51:37] also participate in a study with cybin
[51:40] with MDMA and with 2cb and these um uh
[51:44] yeah experiences actually really help me
[51:47] to recalibrate my life because uh I I
[51:51] experienced my own death for example in
[51:53] in one of the phaa sessions and and that
[51:57] really puts a lot of of uh of these
[52:00] questions yeah into into into a new
[52:03] reality in into into relation so um yeah
[52:06] I I I experienced that in 100 years um
[52:10] most probably I I won't be alive anymore
[52:13] so I really have just a few Decades of
[52:16] high energy High concentration left and
[52:19] do I really want to spend it um spend
[52:22] all my time like I don't know looking at
[52:24] charts or or whatever or do I really
[52:26] want to be in nature do camping or or
[52:29] whatever and personally I I really love
[52:31] camping last year I I spent three weeks
[52:34] in uh in Scotland
[52:36] camping and I I just want to do a lot
[52:39] more camping because it recalibrates it
[52:42] it feels much more um uh yeah compatible
[52:46] with with my own life to just be in
[52:48] nature to to live a simple life and uh
[52:50] to do not be as connected as as I am
[52:53] when I'm here in the office so uh yeah
[52:55] these are these are the the questions
[52:57] that I that I ask myself regularly
[52:59] because at one point I will be 80 years
[53:01] old and I don't want to regret my life
[53:04] decisions of course I'm already 40 right
[53:06] now so I've wasted probably half of my
[53:09] life with random [ __ ] but um at least
[53:13] from now on I want to be a little bit
[53:15] more aware where I invest my my energy
[53:19] and and my time and personally um I
[53:22] think I'm a decent money investor but I
[53:24] want to become an even better better
[53:26] time investor and I think I want to
[53:29] invest um even more energy into into
[53:32] that part of of my life and yes stoicism
[53:35] minimalism these are all really
[53:37] important U principles uh for me that I
[53:40] discovered uh because they just they are
[53:42] just tools to to help me live a even
[53:45] simpler and and an even more fulfilled
[53:47] life because minimalism helps me to not
[53:50] uh clutter my life full of belongings
[53:53] and and stuff that I don't really need
[53:56] and don't care for but need to maintain
[53:58] need to get rid of need to store
[54:01] whatever so I want to um possess as as
[54:04] little things as as I possibly uh can
[54:07] and uh yeah with regards to stoicism it
[54:10] really helps me to put into perspective
[54:12] um what what I'm actually doing in life
[54:14] because the big question that the stoics
[54:16] asks ask themselves is how how to live a
[54:20] good life and uh yeah they asked these
[54:23] questions over 2,000 years ago and we
[54:26] still have the same questions and we can
[54:28] actually learn from their answers
[54:30] because luckily they they weren't online
[54:33] they didn't waste so much time on on X
[54:35] or or YouTube so so they really um yeah
[54:39] made some some deep thoughts about about
[54:41] these topics so we don't have to
[54:43] reinvent the wheel completely we can go
[54:46] back uh to those uh to those thoughts
[54:48] and learn from them adapt them to our
[54:50] own Lifestyles and um interestingly
[54:53] enough um these how these people live
[54:56] 2,000 years ago is actually quite
[54:58] similar how we live these days so they
[55:01] had pretty similar challenges and
[55:03] problems with um wealth and um human
[55:06] relationships and things like that and
[55:09] um I'm really delighted to learn from
[55:11] them and to not have to reinvent the
[55:13] wheel all for myself and there are so
[55:16] many things in there that you just said
[55:18] with uh looking where and I just started
[55:22] that like a few weeks back uh that I uh
[55:25] plan my day completely out from minute
[55:28] to minute uh and I have different
[55:30] calendars for that so in the end of the
[55:32] week and I Al adjusted if something
[55:34] changes so I want to stay flexible
[55:36] because life happens uh but in the end
[55:39] of the week I can really nicely see okay
[55:42] I spend so much time editing YouTube
[55:44] videos I spend so much time uh uh
[55:47] working out or running outside uh I've
[55:50] spend so much time eating stuff like I
[55:53] just have an overview of what I do in a
[55:55] day and what do in a week and then month
[55:57] year and so on and just to reflect on
[56:00] what you're doing helps you so much to
[56:03] see okay where should I go and what do I
[56:05] actually want to do and yeah minimalism
[56:07] is something if you get Bitcoin at some
[56:09] point you get to get experience
[56:12] minimalism because you want to sell
[56:14] everything for Bitcoin it kind of seems
[56:16] like that he had some guest on he was
[56:18] like you have to sell this couch you
[56:20] don't need it but yeah like this car is
[56:23] actually more just for the for the
[56:25] channel because I said on that but
[56:27] that's another topic um maybe uh for
[56:31] besides uh the saying in Bitcoin besides
[56:34] doing what we just talked is do you have
[56:37] any habits or any things you do in your
[56:40] life that you're really religious about
[56:42] like uh anything like morning routines
[56:44] weekly routines what whatever it is
[56:46] anything you are really religious about
[56:48] you never
[56:50] miss yes but it's but it um evolves so
[56:54] it's it's always changing I always have
[56:55] a have a morning routine so right now I
[56:59] actually started this this challenge of
[57:01] um um I I changed a little bit um
[57:05] there's this changee of 100 push-ups per
[57:07] day until Bitcoin reaches 100,000 and I
[57:10] changed it because I don't want to do
[57:12] only push-ups I changed it to 100 reps
[57:15] of of any um of any exercise um per day
[57:18] I I don't do it every day I do it
[57:20] roughly every two days um but I'm right
[57:23] now I think at on day 17 or or 18 so I
[57:27] already done like a good amount of of
[57:29] reps and that actually feels really good
[57:31] so I'm I'm I've always been a uh yeah a
[57:34] sport is always important for me um and
[57:37] uh that's a nice challenge to actually
[57:39] get in 100 reps of one single exercise
[57:43] which I normally don't do so that's
[57:45] something new that I that I did but
[57:47] usually I I go for a walk in the morning
[57:49] because it's important to get uh to get
[57:51] some some uh yeah sunlight exposure for
[57:54] for the Circadian rhythm for for the
[57:56] sleeping because sleeping is actually
[57:58] still a challenge for me for for decades
[58:01] I'm I am actually sleeping too little
[58:03] because um in the evening I'm always so
[58:06] excited listening to something and that
[58:08] I just don't want to stop but in the end
[58:10] I I sleep too little so I'm still
[58:12] working to to fix that and I try to do
[58:14] that with with a morning walk with with
[58:16] some with some workout in in the morning
[58:19] and um yeah basically I uh that's that's
[58:22] everything that's that I that I do right
[58:24] now um focus on on exercise and being
[58:27] outside and in the past I've I've done
[58:30] journaling I've I've done various things
[58:33] but then I also um experienced that if
[58:36] you just start stacking new habits then
[58:40] you basically your morning routine then
[58:43] uh suddenly lasts for four hours because
[58:45] you want to meditate for 30 minutes then
[58:47] you want to do a a walk outside then you
[58:49] want to exercise for for half an hour
[58:51] then you want to do journaling then you
[58:53] want to do whatever and yeah it's it
[58:55] basically inflates the morning routine
[58:58] so I always have to deflate it back
[59:00] again and and focus on what is truly
[59:02] important and right now I would say that
[59:04] um exercise is is the most important
[59:06] being outside exercise and then um to
[59:09] live uh try to live according according
[59:11] to that yeah it's it's funny to me
[59:14] because morning routine I had this pH
[59:17] where I like tried to have the best
[59:19] morning routine and it got more and more
[59:21] and more and then there was uh I don't
[59:23] know who was it some internet video saw
[59:25] it I was like morning routine is just
[59:28] there for getting you from Sleepy state
[59:31] to awake state to to being productive to
[59:34] bring uh in a in a good state of mind
[59:37] that you can do whatever you want to do
[59:39] on that day so whatever is that morning
[59:41] routine if it's standing up and walking
[59:43] for 20 minutes which is Amazing by the
[59:45] way uh for anybody who did not try that
[59:48] um then it is then this is your 20
[59:51] minutes morning routine uh because if
[59:53] you're doing like this three four hours
[59:55] morning routine and this and that and
[59:57] that then you're so exhausted after the
[59:59] morning routine that you need again and
[60:02] if it gets like if it then it becomes
[60:04] like a chore because you feel that you
[60:06] have this streak and you don't want to
[60:08] break the streak and then it it just it
[60:11] it becomes just a job um and and i' I've
[60:13] been there I I also Tred try that but
[60:16] right now I'm I'm more relaxed and what
[60:18] I also do I don't eat breakfast so I I
[60:20] do a uh intermittent fasting I think
[60:23] that's that's a that's a really good
[60:24] thing so I only eat I I just had lunch
[60:27] uh or I just had breakfast and and lunch
[60:29] uh before uh before this recording so so
[60:32] I usually eat at around 1 or or 2 p.m in
[60:35] the afternoon that's my first meal so
[60:37] that's that's what I do but other than
[60:39] that um I think um the the more relaxed
[60:43] version uh suits me much better yeah I'm
[60:46] I'm also doing intermed fasting I think
[60:47] 17 hours I usually try to hit uh it's
[60:51] usually 13 to 14 hours but 17 is my my
[60:54] goal today I'm probably 20 hours but
[60:57] because my schedule is
[61:00] weird uh perfect then uh I have one last
[61:03] Bitcoin question before we come to the
[61:06] end routine of of our podcast um how do
[61:09] you see uh Bitcoin adoption growing in
[61:12] the next like 10 years and then not only
[61:14] talking about the price of course price
[61:16] is a the end consequence of that but uh
[61:20] nation states people investing Bitcoin
[61:23] that's like there like 2020 was micos
[61:25] strategy the first publicly traded
[61:27] company that went in Bitcoin now we have
[61:29] like 60 70 80 or something like that
[61:31] maybe 100 I don't know did not look for
[61:34] like a good amount of time um how do you
[61:37] see Bitcoin adoption growing in the next
[61:39] year what what do you think we will uh
[61:42] hit in the next 10 years for
[61:45] Bitcoin I mean if if we assume that we
[61:47] are right now at roughly 400 million
[61:51] people and I I think the estimates vary
[61:53] some say 100 million some say 400 let's
[61:55] let's go with the with a bigger number
[61:58] and we have 8 billion people right then
[62:00] we would be at an adoption of roughly 5%
[62:03] maybe between two two and 5% I think
[62:05] would be a a reasonable guess um but
[62:08] then we also have to ask yeah does
[62:10] someone just have 10€ 10 or or 10 US
[62:13] Dollars just as a fun uh as a fun um
[62:17] yeah bets or or is it really a
[62:19] substantial uh uh substantial adoption
[62:22] um of of like um yeah substantial amount
[62:25] and I think um if if we would take that
[62:28] as a hurdle then the adoption would be
[62:30] much less of course but I I think it it
[62:32] will it will grow um that's that's the
[62:34] only thing I can say I I think that the
[62:37] the spot ETF will help to to bring it to
[62:39] the masses so I I think the spot ETF is
[62:42] fantastic um of course we we always also
[62:45] it also has some downsides we now have a
[62:47] lot of coins at coinbase I think it's
[62:50] only a matter of time um uh yeah until
[62:53] coinbase like gets hacked or has some
[62:55] kind of social engineering or some kind
[62:57] of problem so that there will be hiccups
[62:59] there are always hiccups but I think um
[63:01] it it will grow tenfold at least so we
[63:04] will be at an adoption of I don't know
[63:07] hopefully 50% in in 10 years that that
[63:09] would be fantastic of like people having
[63:13] meaningful exposure to to bitcoin um
[63:16] directly or indirectly um but I think
[63:19] long term um I don't see a reason why it
[63:22] shouldn't be 80 or 90% And um yeah if
[63:25] Bitcoin then is really successful as as
[63:27] we talked about it will eat itself into
[63:29] the economy so even if people think they
[63:32] don't have any Bitcoin exposure they
[63:34] will automatically have some uh because
[63:36] their Pension funds will will have an
[63:38] exposure to that Etc so so I think we
[63:41] will go eventually hopefully to a 100%
[63:45] um adoption um direct and indirect but
[63:48] um how fast it will go that's that's
[63:49] anyone's guess of course if this bull
[63:51] cycle will be um fantastic price-wise
[63:55] then um it will draw in a lot of people
[63:58] then depending on the bare Market um how
[64:00] many people will get flushed out it's
[64:02] always e and e and flow but um I don't
[64:05] see a reason why it shouldn't 10 or 20 x
[64:07] from here so um uh yeah that's that's
[64:09] that's my guess and I I think um sailor
[64:13] uh new gold era for the next 10 years I
[64:15] think this Rings really true so we have
[64:18] now this year is having then we probably
[64:20] have yeah then we have two more
[64:25] years and then we will be um uh yeah in
[64:29] in the middle of of the next um of the
[64:31] next having so so this will be roughly
[64:33] the the 10 years and um yeah I think
[64:37] these are really exciting times and um I
[64:39] really can't wait for more Nations and
[64:42] and I also believe that I mean right now
[64:44] micro strategy is the only company that
[64:46] is um doing the treasury strategy really
[64:50] um earnestly right I mean there are as
[64:52] you said there are dozens of companies
[64:54] that that already do it but I think
[64:56] micro strategy is on the next level and
[64:58] the Playbook is in plain sight right you
[65:01] just have to open your eyes and and you
[65:04] see it and I just don't see a world
[65:07] where um large companies like apple or
[65:10] Amazon or yeah whatever o oil companies
[65:14] or whatever it may be that have huge
[65:16] cash reserves why they shouldn't adopt
[65:19] at least a partial um Bitcoin treasury
[65:21] strategy so I assume there will be at
[65:24] least a couple companies that will copy
[65:28] micro strategy there will be of course a
[65:30] lot of nation states that will um that
[65:33] will get into mining um Etc like like
[65:36] there are a lot of um lot of countries
[65:38] right now lot of smaller countries and I
[65:41] think um bigger countries will also
[65:43] secretly start buying Bitcoin
[65:46] um uh yeah National Banks will will um
[65:49] hopefully more and more National Banks
[65:51] will will also um maybe take 1% um in in
[65:54] their Treasury so um yeah I just see
[65:57] only only positive signs um and how far
[66:00] and and how fast this will this will go
[66:03] nobody knows I think it will be a little
[66:05] bit slower than than we optimists think
[66:08] because everything goes two to three
[66:10] times longer than than we expect but I
[66:13] think we will eventually get there and
[66:15] um yeah there will be hiccups on the way
[66:17] like we had with with FDX and and mount
[66:19] GA and everything along the way there
[66:21] will be hiccups but um yeah it it will
[66:24] be another another 10x adoption from
[66:27] here and let's see what the what the
[66:29] price will do I mean it's it's anyone's
[66:30] guess but um I think everyone that has
[66:33] some big Bitcoin exposure I think it's
[66:35] it's still a fantastic bet to to do even
[66:38] at these prices right now I mean the
[66:40] bull market just started we just broke
[66:42] the new all-time high so um I think
[66:44] we're off Off to the Races now and yeah
[66:47] it's just saying what a time to be alive
[66:49] and it's it's really true that's kind of
[66:52] what I also try to do with the podcast
[66:53] and it's like in 1971 you made the
[66:56] comparison with Bitcoin being now 1971
[66:59] if with the adoption early in the
[67:01] podcast and there we did not had really
[67:04] podcasts that document all life and this
[67:06] is kind of my goal with this this
[67:08] podcast just to document everything and
[67:12] this is why I want to have so many
[67:13] different people in uh on this podcast
[67:17] uh in some connection with Bitcoin has
[67:19] to be there this is the
[67:21] only hurdle basically and they love to
[67:25] see uh it's inv evolving into something
[67:28] really really nice uh so our end routine
[67:30] is where the previous guest asks a
[67:33] question for the next guest without
[67:34] knowing who is the next guest uh and the
[67:37] next uh question for the next uh the the
[67:41] question is about clown world uh do you
[67:44] know the the the word clown World
[67:47] probably uh no a clown world this it's
[67:53] uh the word uh that describes everything
[67:55] that goes wrong like this is It's a a
[67:58] major uh thing that is going on now with
[68:01] like oh oh this is happening clown world
[68:03] like this is this this clown Smiley and
[68:06] then the world Smiley it's it's just um
[68:09] a meme nowadays that describes stuff
[68:11] that goes wrong I think people use it
[68:15] more and more and the question was do
[68:17] you think that clown world will get
[68:19] better or worse from here uh and I mean
[68:23] clown will in that means like things go
[68:25] wrong in your view with the world I
[68:28] think it it will it will go worse from
[68:31] here um and the reason why is I read
[68:36] this uh famous um yeah science fiction
[68:40] book um the the Atlas Shrug I think it's
[68:43] one of the uh yeah recommended books by
[68:47] by Elon Musk and and many many others
[68:49] and it it just shows an alternate um
[68:53] Universe an alternate history
[68:56] of um I think the United States when the
[68:59] bureaucrats actually would win and um I
[69:03] see a lot of signs that we are going
[69:06] into into this direction so it's
[69:08] basically um yeah the plot is that the
[69:11] the bureaucrats are basically gaining a
[69:14] lot more power and are um yeah uh
[69:18] creating these these hurdles and and
[69:20] making it more difficult for the real uh
[69:23] innovators and for the real
[69:24] entrepreneurs that are actually um
[69:27] producing um everything in the economy
[69:30] um that are basically driving them away
[69:32] and and um it goes so far that then the
[69:36] innovators need to um basically exit the
[69:40] the old system um go to a complete
[69:43] different geographic location and
[69:45] basically um yeah found a new country a
[69:50] new community where they are free again
[69:53] and I think um yeah that we are
[69:55] certainly on on this path of um of
[69:59] things getting more complicated we see
[70:01] it with regulation we see it with
[70:03] bureaucracy with um just stupid foolish
[70:07] um yeah whatever foolishness um in
[70:09] general with with foolish laws Etc so I
[70:12] think um I I don't see a reason why this
[70:14] should stop any anytime soon um but I
[70:17] also think that there are so many
[70:19] intelligent people in the world and so
[70:21] many people that are actually um
[70:23] creating the value that um again the
[70:26] similar like we talked about with with
[70:28] Bitcoin and and the old system um I
[70:30] think there also will be a fight between
[70:33] the bureaucrats and the innovators and
[70:36] um yeah in in the book The the
[70:38] bureaucrats um somehow won a little bit
[70:41] or at least um uh yeah in in the
[70:43] beginning and um I think it yeah we we
[70:47] are on a similar tra trajectory so um
[70:50] yeah depending on the country that you
[70:52] are right now um it's really difficult
[70:54] to start company it's really difficult
[70:56] to to do business especially in the
[70:58] financial um sector uh with with all the
[71:01] AML regulations Etc um so um I think it
[71:05] will get worse um but I'm an eternal
[71:08] optimist and I hope that in the end um
[71:12] yeah the the common sense will will win
[71:15] yeah hope for the best prepare for the
[71:17] worst something like
[71:20] that uh thank you for being on Rayo it
