[00:00] we have security so we have opportunity
[00:01] and we have Bitcoin we are making
[00:03] Bitcoin legal tender and we trying to be
[00:05] independent from America from all those
[00:07] institutions I know that sa won't be the
[00:09] last country using Bitcoin it's just the
[00:11] first one Bitcoin is good for business
[00:13] we know our history so we know what we
[00:15] have suffer I will do that even if I
[00:17] don't get paid at all till I'm dead to
[00:20] tell the United States we are not going
[00:23] to do your rules because we have done it
[00:25] in the past and it didn't
[00:27] work you're the first Salvadorian
[00:30] Bitcoin podcast with uh
[00:33] bitor bit Corner bit Corner ah nice when
[00:38] did you start it and then like why did
[00:40] it uh kick off for
[00:42] you yeah so I started actually um this
[00:47] month is the first anniversary of bit
[00:49] Corner podcast and uh I started yeah and
[00:53] I started because you know uh when B
[00:57] made it uh a little tender Bitcoin legal
[01:00] tender I I was super excited uh I knew
[01:04] Bitcoin because of my studies and later
[01:06] we can go the DI into it uh but when I
[01:11] saw that I I thought in that moment that
[01:15] there was like going to be like a lot of
[01:17] content about about Bitcoin sub there
[01:19] you know there were all these news about
[01:22] the adoption and uh I heard that there
[01:26] was a lot of um education there
[01:30] uh little by little yes yes it is true
[01:33] there's a lot of education but it's
[01:35] happening smoothly it's not like uh what
[01:39] people thought that it was going to be
[01:41] at the beginning like with the Cho that
[01:43] the government was giving $30 to every
[01:46] Salvadorian citizens to have Bitcoin and
[01:48] instantly people will know how to to use
[01:51] it that wasn't the the case because as
[01:55] people knew later uh Cho wasn't that
[01:58] good it a lot of improvements so it was
[02:02] kyc so uh people barely knew about
[02:07] Bitcoin actually still today there are
[02:09] some people that think that Bitcoin it's
[02:12] something related to the government
[02:14] something uh that B made and that's not
[02:17] true so uh we need a lot of education
[02:21] and uh most of the educations uh or most
[02:25] of the content about Bitcoin are in
[02:28] English you know
[02:30] so even the the first news that we he
[02:33] about mostly everything is in English so
[02:37] uh there are there are good bitcoiners
[02:40] that um speak in Spanish that are in
[02:43] Latin America actually I have some
[02:45] friends that are from South America now
[02:48] are living in Salvador and they create a
[02:51] good content uh but still uh even them
[02:55] uh create their own content in Spanish
[02:58] but still they work for English
[02:59] companies so as you can perceive now
[03:02] there's a lot of lack of educational
[03:05] content in Spanish and uh I was thinking
[03:09] that there was going to be you know like
[03:11] TV shows about Bitcoins or podcasters or
[03:14] whatever of YouTubers uh but it didn't
[03:17] happen and I was so enthusiastic about
[03:20] Bitcoin that I started talking about my
[03:23] family that I also use Bitcoin I know
[03:25] about Bitcoin and some friends and they
[03:27] told me like you just should do it and I
[03:29] was like yeah why not I'm going to do it
[03:34] and uh but my idea still was uh how how
[03:38] can you solve this problem you know
[03:40] because even though the people that I
[03:43] used to and still watch or or listen on
[03:48] podcast or
[03:49] YouTube everything is basically in
[03:51] English so I thought that okay I I want
[03:55] to make the show that uh mostly I I
[03:59] consume and that I will like my people
[04:02] you know subar will like and we will
[04:05] start in simple terms and even if the
[04:08] guess is in English I'm going to
[04:10] subtitle I'm going to subtitle by myself
[04:13] with uh with of course the the help of
[04:16] AI because if not it's impossible and um
[04:20] and that's that's how I did so I started
[04:22] to invite some people and and to start a
[04:27] podcast and then I started titled that
[04:30] and little by little with worth a mouth
[04:33] I knew other bitcoiners that also were
[04:36] good bitcoiners that working were
[04:38] working on Salvador even salvadorians
[04:40] and that's how I started to find out
[04:43] that there are content Spanish that are
[04:46] good content in the Spanish but they
[04:49] just need uh they just need to some
[04:53] Source where they can be here you know
[04:56] even in English and Spanish so that's
[04:58] when that's when it hit me and I was
[05:00] like okay so I'm doing this kind of
[05:02] content in English with Spanish
[05:05] subtitles but I also going to do it vice
[05:07] versa you know so I'm going to do the
[05:10] the podcast with salvadorians or Spanish
[05:13] speakers but I'm not going to tell them
[05:15] okay let's speak in English so we can
[05:17] spread the word because you know
[05:20] everyone speak English I'm going to do
[05:22] it in Spanish because we speak Spanish
[05:23] but I'm going to do it vice versa I'm
[05:25] going to subtitle in English and that's
[05:27] how I play it so my podcast the kind of
[05:30] different differentiation you know that
[05:33] if it is in English you you will get
[05:34] Spanish subtitles and if it is Spanish
[05:36] you will get English subtitles and
[05:38] that's a way that you can uh close the
[05:41] bridge so that's how I started yeah it's
[05:44] it's it's interesting for me because um
[05:46] I think with eii now we are really it's
[05:49] really like if you go back like 10 Years
[05:52] everybody had do their own transcript
[05:54] there was podcast where somebody just
[05:57] wrote down what they are saying and
[05:58] stuff like that this is not like you
[06:01] don't have to do that anymore this is we
[06:03] talked earlier about Riverside it's so
[06:05] easy now they're giving you the
[06:06] transcript they giving you a summary of
[06:09] everything uh and I think if we are
[06:11] moving out like another 10 20 30 years I
[06:15] think it does not matter which language
[06:16] you are doing the podcast in because it
[06:19] will be Auto translated on all the
[06:21] platforms with AI in real time in your
[06:25] uh voice and you will just speak uh
[06:27] Hindi you will speak German you will
[06:29] speak Spanish you will speak English you
[06:31] will speak every language uh and The
[06:34] Listener will just like oh I have my
[06:37] YouTube app I will consume everything in
[06:40] uh German I will consume everything in
[06:42] Spanish and everything will be uh um
[06:45] translated anyways uh I think uh
[06:49] language now uh uh is still very very
[06:53] important but I think it will be less
[06:55] and less important over time as the
[06:57] world moves closer and closer closer
[07:00] together yeah so that was uh just for me
[07:03] like two cents on on on on language it
[07:06] has nothing to do with
[07:08] Bitcoin
[07:09] but I'm really interested in uh El
[07:13] Salvador I had already uh a few few
[07:17] guests on that were from other parts in
[07:19] the world and mov to
[07:21] Salvador I and I actually had people uh
[07:25] from Bitcoin Berlin on that were from
[07:30] uh there was like this one guy who
[07:32] founded it and he was always from
[07:34] Salvador but he moved to bitcoin Berlin
[07:36] and the other guy Charlie he was from
[07:38] London and moved to El Salvador so you
[07:41] are my second person I think that I was
[07:44] is actually born in Salvador um how is
[07:48] the adoption there actually going uh
[07:51] yeah so as as I mentioned earlier
[07:53] actually uh um I speak I spoke a couple
[07:57] weeks ago with with the guys the team
[08:00] that it that are from Bitcoin Berlin and
[08:02] we were discussing about that uh so yeah
[08:05] they um they tell me in from what I know
[08:08] because I before starting recording I
[08:10] told you that my parents were here so we
[08:12] were discussing about this and uh the
[08:15] adoption is continuing but slowly so
[08:19] there are a lot of educational Bitcoin
[08:22] schools or or institutions that are
[08:25] working on that it's it's happening
[08:27] slowly mostly the capital like in San
[08:30] Salvador of course Bitcoin B that it's
[08:34] Elon and that are spreading in some
[08:36] parts uh around the the capital little
[08:39] by little so that's why uh my first
[08:43] Bitcoin my Prem Bitcoin I work in so
[08:45] hard on it uh actually they I don't know
[08:48] if you know know that uh last year they
[08:51] made this deal that this partnership
[08:53] with the government so they are now are
[08:55] going to work with Public Schools
[08:58] they're going to start are teaching uh
[09:00] their program the M Bitcoin program in
[09:03] the
[09:04] schools and so I think that's super nice
[09:07] because the futures of course are the
[09:09] kids uh so they're securing the the
[09:12] future you know they're doing really
[09:15] good some good bases for the future of
[09:19] salador but there's also a lack of
[09:22] Bitcoin education um in
[09:25] the in the all the you know the the
[09:28] workers the the small businesses like a
[09:32] small shop in the community or whatever
[09:36] so that's where actually Bitcoin Berlin
[09:39] is is working on they they moved to
[09:41] Berlin that's why they made their
[09:44] they're doing this educational project
[09:47] there and they started to go to small
[09:50] businesses and they also told me that
[09:53] they started talking about Bitcoin but
[09:55] of course if you go like hey have you
[09:57] ever heard about Bitcoin there was like
[09:59] okay this is a scan they trying to to
[10:01] sell me something no so actually the the
[10:05] approach to do the the good approach to
[10:08] the work the way to to talk about
[10:10] Bitcoin is just using it like you go you
[10:14] buy something to them and they say do
[10:17] you a Bitcoin and they say yes or no and
[10:20] if they say no you say why and they tell
[10:25] you because it's too complicated because
[10:28] um
[10:29] or nobody came there before to explain
[10:33] them how it works so that's how you do
[10:36] it you go you try to buy something you
[10:38] say okay I'm going to explain to use
[10:40] Bitcoin super easy just uh download this
[10:43] non kyc you know
[10:45] wallet pick one randomly or if you
[10:49] happens that you have chibo installed
[10:51] but nobody uh tell you how to use it I'm
[10:54] going to show you how to use it uh it's
[10:56] super easy you show them how to use it
[10:58] you pay for it
[10:59] and that's it and and that's how is it
[11:03] is happening you know so it is happening
[11:06] smoothly little by little but as I
[11:10] mentioned there are some projects that
[11:12] are working on right now salador and uh
[11:15] but yeah we still need more education
[11:18] about it uh even you know that's why me
[11:22] PR Bitcoin uh exist that's why my
[11:25] podcast exist that's why Bitcoin will
[11:27] exist we just need uh more uh bitcoiners
[11:32] no matter if you speak in English or
[11:34] Spanish but that you go those up there
[11:36] and just uh start using it as as the way
[11:40] it is you know to help people that they
[11:43] don't have banking system just go to a
[11:45] small Shop try to buy something uh if
[11:49] you visit Al saor you will see many
[11:52] stores that they say accept Bitcoin and
[11:54] even if you don't see those just go try
[11:57] to consume buy something and ask them
[12:00] and uh if you can help them salvadorians
[12:03] are open to always to listen they're
[12:05] very funny so it's really rarely that
[12:08] they will say no they are open to listen
[12:10] yeah it's an interesting spot where you
[12:14] are because you as you said knew Bitcoin
[12:19] before adopted the Bitcoin standard for
[12:22] like salv right so uh how was that
[12:27] feeling when you
[12:29] uh like I assume you were a bitcoiner in
[12:32] 2021 how was it feeling you are in Sal
[12:36] El Salvadoran uh person you were born
[12:39] there and then all of the sudden the
[12:41] leader comes out and you are convinced
[12:43] of that Bitcoin idea and all of the
[12:45] sudden the leader comes out and says
[12:47] like oh yeah we are uh making Bitcoin
[12:50] legal tender and and we're trying to be
[12:53] independent from America from all those
[12:55] institutions um how is that how is that
[12:57] feeling like how did you you see that
[12:59] news coming and did it surprise
[13:02] you yeah
[13:04] absolutely actually yeah I think uh when
[13:07] that happened it was 2021 I guess right
[13:11] so it it was in the middle of Co yeah so
[13:14] it was in the middle of C uh so yeah
[13:18] actually I I started to listen about
[13:21] Bitcoin in 2007 17 because I I'm
[13:26] engineered so uh I studied it in the
[13:30] University but more in the you know in
[13:32] terms of blockchain and how it works so
[13:36] uh you know the ter of blockchain is
[13:38] super boring and it's actually it's not
[13:40] that good in in terms of engineering
[13:43] because the process is super slow but I
[13:45] mean it get it it's a way to have it how
[13:48] all the data well structur and open Etc
[13:52] so by 2017 I wasn't that um interested
[13:58] about Bitcoin
[13:59] but then it happens that uh like a few
[14:02] years later uh I started talking about
[14:06] Bitcoin like like pure chance with my
[14:10] sister I remember we were in a park and
[14:12] I don't remember what we were talking
[14:13] about but uh she mentioned Bitcoin and
[14:16] she's not an engineer she is a business
[14:19] business administrator and she was
[14:21] talking about Bitcoin she told me that
[14:22] she was talking about Bitcoin with my
[14:23] dad and my dad is a doctor so I was like
[14:26] I was like when I was having this
[14:27] conversation I was thinking like okay so
[14:29] my dad is a doctor my sister is a
[14:31] business administrator and I'm an
[14:33] engineer so something's going on because
[14:34] the three of us are from different
[14:36] fields and we the three of us are
[14:38] interested in Bitcoin you know and uh so
[14:42] yeah we discussed about that and uh
[14:44] that's when my curiosity started my it
[14:48] could say that it was my home moment of
[14:51] of that I wanted to learn deeper about
[14:53] Bitcoin that's what I did and that's
[14:55] what I actually did in in Co like
[14:58] learning super deep and and then yeah I
[15:03] heard the news uh
[15:04] about saying about this and I think it's
[15:09] you know it's it's super interesting
[15:11] because uh what was going on in that
[15:14] moment is that he declared the war to
[15:16] the G you know so they were saying that
[15:19] okay we're going to clean the street
[15:20] that there's enough of this uh blood
[15:23] bath uh we have been suffering a lot and
[15:27] so we're going to to fight against them
[15:30] and we're going to fight fight against
[15:32] corruption so that's what he did and um
[15:37] so when he has the idea of abducting
[15:40] Bitcoin for me for for my personal
[15:44] opinion it was super Brave and and super
[15:47] smart because it was a way
[15:50] to um to declar the war not just just
[15:54] the grand the G member but also the
[15:57] elites you know to tell like the
[16:00] exterior that United State on all um
[16:04] this government that uh we are not going
[16:07] to do your rules because we have done it
[16:11] in the past and it didn't work actually
[16:14] it was the opposite and we know how
[16:16] America works you know that that the
[16:19] they need to go toward wors uh because
[16:23] their money is based on nothing so they
[16:27] just go towards and do that and that's
[16:29] basically how it also works uh the depth
[16:32] in Latin America they they loow money
[16:35] but by their own terms and that's how
[16:37] basically they have some control in
[16:39] Latin America so that's what also
[16:41] happened in El saadabad it was a poor
[16:44] comp country still is a poor country but
[16:47] it's increasing you know the economy is
[16:50] improving uh but B said like okay we're
[16:52] going to do it in our own ways so we
[16:56] have this tool that we have seen in this
[16:58] is a small community that it worked it
[17:00] was a pure Community uh they didn't have
[17:02] anything like uh clean water electricity
[17:06] uh it was Elon was just known for Surfer
[17:09] because is actually we have good waves
[17:10] in Mader but beyond that it's uh it was
[17:15] uh but that time lante was just uh a
[17:18] small Beach for Surfers and they have
[17:20] like this small uh Bas but super simples
[17:24] where you can go and spend a night or
[17:27] the small bars but the simplest as
[17:29] possible you know made of out wood uh
[17:33] but yeah so the months passed and they
[17:36] they have been using Bitcoin and they
[17:39] have increased increased their not just
[17:42] their small economy but their their
[17:45] livings they were increasing you know uh
[17:48] how they lives in terms of they have
[17:51] somehow money to to save and to to use
[17:55] it in the
[17:56] community uh and of course B is a it's a
[18:01] very wise man he has you know Max Kaiser
[18:04] as this person that he's helping him uh
[18:08] in everything related to bitcoin of
[18:10] course Sams M help him so there are
[18:13] smart people around him and he saw what
[18:15] happened in in
[18:16] lante uh
[18:19] so by that moment when I when he
[18:22] announced that he was going to adopt
[18:24] Bitcoin uh I thought that that was a
[18:26] smart move and I kind of thought that it
[18:29] was doing it because of this because
[18:31] otherwise uh if you play by the rules of
[18:34] America uh with the FIP system it
[18:37] wouldn't change at all so he find out
[18:40] that this tool can help to be
[18:42] independent and to uh declare the war
[18:46] and clean everything all salador and
[18:48] somehow uh exit this uh
[18:52] this you know um system that we have
[18:56] been uh using in the past and never
[18:59] worked and now now we are adopting
[19:03] Bitcoin with the this new system and
[19:06] that's how this increased for for me and
[19:09] my family was like okay he's doing a
[19:11] smart move and uh we are really excited
[19:14] and see how it goes and the time P time
[19:16] we have seen what what happened sa yeah
[19:20] and it's also fascinating for me that na
[19:23] B is in El Salvador seemingly I'm
[19:29] in Austria like I don't see what's
[19:30] actually going on in Salvador but from
[19:32] everything I see is really popular in
[19:35] the uh with the people and this is
[19:38] something completely uncommon in Austria
[19:42] and in German at least in this this time
[19:47] uh and it's it's it's weird for me to
[19:49] have such great uh acceptance rates also
[19:53] and and rates that are like so clear
[19:56] that nauk is like the leader of El
[19:59] Salvador and he was also um just now
[20:03] reelected when this comes out it's has
[20:05] been a few weeks uh and how like do
[20:10] actually the people in Salvador uh VI
[20:13] him that positively and um what are the
[20:18] maybe the critics saying about him is
[20:21] there like I can imagine if if there are
[20:24] like opposite parties also and the
[20:26] opposite candidates of course course
[20:28] there will be some critics also of him
[20:30] what are they saying about him and um is
[20:33] it true that the nukul is such an um
[20:37] such popular uh person in El
[20:41] Salo yeah absolutely so actually he is
[20:45] very popular uh if you I don't know if
[20:48] you have seen the U the metrics but uh
[20:51] outside outside El salador uh the ones
[20:55] that we voted around the world he got
[20:58] 97% of the you know yeah so it was super
[21:03] yeah so it's incredible and that's
[21:06] Europe United States and Asia you know
[21:10] so and that's interesting uh because I
[21:13] just wanted to like quickly say that
[21:15] because in Europe especially in Germany
[21:17] and in Austria we get a lot of bad news
[21:20] about Nuka like outside the uh Bitcoin
[21:24] world like when you are in Bitcoin
[21:26] Twitter and stuff like that I only see
[21:28] good news but when I see in the
[21:30] mainstream media especially those that
[21:32] are paid from the
[21:33] government uh it's like the cool
[21:36] dictator na bu a really big uh media
[21:42] Outlet in Germany uh finan by the German
[21:46] uh German government said that in an
[21:49] article uh with the reelection so it's
[21:52] interesting for me to see that the uh
[21:55] people that live in Europe and have this
[21:58] uh reverse propaganda about naly that
[22:01] he's like a dictator and he's so rude to
[22:04] everyone with the gangs and this is
[22:06] actually something that is heard in the
[22:10] in the mainstream media but I guess
[22:11] nobody consumes them anymore because
[22:13] everybody knows
[22:15] that they're talking [ __ ] at least I
[22:18] think so uh and so it's a really
[22:21] interesting stat that like such an high
[22:23] amount actually want him outside and so
[22:27] but Al inside like in El he also got
[22:30] really good wordss right yeah he got uh
[22:35] 87% I think yeah so far I I think it's
[22:39] not official yet because they are still
[22:41] counting I think maybe today they will
[22:43] have the the final metrics of course
[22:45] when this is released we will have the
[22:47] the official statistics but yeah it was
[22:50] like 87% so that's huge I think the last
[22:53] uh president that got uh the most voted
[22:57] in impressively was Joe Biden with f
[23:00] 88% no sorry 58% I I think in the United
[23:05] States yeah yeah so that's that's
[23:10] something unusual but yeah he's quite
[23:12] popular and people love it I I mean I
[23:16] don't know how much people know the
[23:19] story about saer and it's too long to
[23:23] tell in just in a podcast but I'm going
[23:24] to resume and give you a long story
[23:26] short but I by all the people that watch
[23:29] this podcast to uh do your own research
[23:33] about this story of Salvador is quite
[23:34] fascinating sad and it's a it's it been
[23:40] tough the past um years even before I
[23:43] was born but but yeah we had a civil war
[23:46] in the 80s and then in the 90s we had
[23:49] the consequences of the you know of that
[23:53] war the Civil War so uh the guns member
[23:57] actually a consequence about that uh and
[24:01] uh so yeah we we switch from war one war
[24:05] to another one that actually was worse
[24:08] for a long time we thought that Civil
[24:10] War because it was actually a war like
[24:14] we see in you know what's going on right
[24:17] now in Russia and Ukraine and other
[24:19] parts of the world it was like that but
[24:22] the thing is that the war against the
[24:25] Gans member was different because it was
[24:27] mostly between them and the and then
[24:30] with disobedience but the things that
[24:32] did Disobedience of course they weren't
[24:35] at War they were just living their life
[24:37] uh so little by little uh they were
[24:40] gaining power and they gained power
[24:44] because uh before buele we had two
[24:47] governments first the the righties and
[24:50] then the lefties the righst were uh
[24:53] Arena the mostly Arena uh it's uh it's
[24:57] conform with you know the basically the
[25:01] the elites uh people that are have huge
[25:05] businesses that you know that they have
[25:09] even their own Enterprises in United
[25:11] States or work with a huge business
[25:13] businesses in United States and so they
[25:17] rule by 20 years no hold on yeah I don't
[25:23] yeah maybe 20 years I don't know yeah I
[25:25] think so and uh but they were so corrupt
[25:29] with that and then
[25:32] um that's the how the gun member gained
[25:35] some power but then the left because we
[25:38] were you know we were exhausted about
[25:42] all the corruption then the left said
[25:44] okay we have the solution let's give the
[25:45] power to the people because the left was
[25:48] basically um there was a party that
[25:51] there was made for Teacher philosophers
[25:53] doctors Etc uh so uh uh or you know like
[26:00] journalist and actually our first
[26:02] journalist was sorry our first president
[26:05] in the leftist side was maunes that he
[26:08] used to be a famous journalist in lader
[26:11] and he came like and he was very popular
[26:13] by that time people love him by that
[26:15] time so he he won the election and he
[26:18] said that okay we're we're going to
[26:20] solve the problems that sa have had in
[26:24] that moment but it happened that it was
[26:27] they were they were doing the same thing
[26:29] you know they just came to power and to
[26:31] be corrupt they just Rob money and
[26:33] continue uh being corrupted with the gun
[26:36] members and actually I think that they
[26:38] facilitated the way they spread their uh
[26:42] all the drugs and everything you know
[26:44] saer and meanwhile in that time buele he
[26:48] got the this he was
[26:51] the uh I don't know how to say this in
[26:54] English but you know the one that rules
[26:55] a small community how do you say this
[26:58] like a small town Village like the mayor
[27:00] the mayor may may mayor of the village
[27:03] yeah yeah so he was the mayor of no
[27:07] cuscatlan and uh he was doing like good
[27:11] stuff there he was he was cleaning all
[27:13] this uh you know violence that they were
[27:15] there he was improving in education he
[27:17] was uh building uh some parks and he was
[27:20] doing a small projects artistic projects
[27:22] so kids can go there and not just to
[27:25] join a a again so they can do something
[27:28] productive uh in people of no catam at
[27:31] that time they were super uh they were
[27:35] super happy with B then he rolled to to
[27:38] be a major in San Salvador the capital
[27:41] and he won H but of course there were
[27:44] critics that you know it's not the same
[27:46] rule as a small a small town that the
[27:49] capital uh but actually he made it and
[27:52] he made it super well so then he ruled
[27:54] to to
[27:56] presidency and of course there were the
[27:58] same critics that it's not the same to
[28:00] Ru the entire country that just the
[28:02] capital but still he did but
[28:06] um uh so when he ruled
[28:09] to to president the first time he was he
[28:14] has this idea to create noas that is the
[28:18] his party but um I don't I don't
[28:22] remember exactly what happened but uh he
[28:25] couldn't rule with noas that time I
[28:28] think they did everything so he couldn't
[28:32] um rule with nasas so he ruled with
[28:34] another party but still he won and then
[28:38] it came after that uh it came noas
[28:42] because they found ASAS for the
[28:45] parliament you know and uh that's that's
[28:49] how the that started and nowas mainly
[28:52] for the people that don't know are made
[28:55] with people of my age Millennial of
[28:58] urgency people that saw everything that
[29:02] was going on in Salvador that we grew in
[29:05] violence uh that we saw basically in our
[29:09] entire life suffering and violence we
[29:12] have seen our families go to to United
[29:15] States or you know Europe escaping from
[29:18] that violence or uh so yeah that's
[29:21] that's how no CIA was founded with
[29:25] people that they just want wanted to do
[29:28] something different because we have seen
[29:30] that uh no matter if was Arena or FN the
[29:34] two parties like the equivalent in
[29:37] United State Democrats and Republicans
[29:39] was the same uh so that's how it started
[29:43] and U little by little Buel was pretty
[29:47] famous because but that time when he was
[29:49] president because people have seen what
[29:51] he was doing in this and in no cuscatlan
[29:55] and then in the capital so people but
[29:57] that time they were already satisfied
[29:59] with him you know so he was very popular
[30:02] and U and then came of course the chis I
[30:05] think major the the major criticism
[30:08] about Bell that uh you know the medians
[30:10] and the government says that he's a a
[30:12] dictator or not is because the measure
[30:15] that he's doing in the way that he is
[30:18] fighting against the gun member that it
[30:21] is that if you see someone with a tattoo
[30:25] go to jail actually that's not how works
[30:27] because uh the gun members they do they
[30:32] all of them have statos but they have
[30:34] the tattoo of the gun that they belongs
[30:36] you know so but there's a Twist because
[30:40] if you have those tattoos it implies
[30:43] that um for what I know that you have
[30:46] robbed killed and kidnapped someone in
[30:48] the past because I think it's that the
[30:50] ritual that they do so they of course
[30:52] are already criminals so uh it was
[30:57] basically so easy forell it because he
[31:00] just had to search for the people that
[31:02] has the tto like okay you're criminal so
[31:04] go to jail it's not that you have like I
[31:06] don't know like a um a tattoo of of a
[31:10] lion of a flower you go to jail no
[31:12] that's that's not like that Dophin it's
[31:14] not like that uh so basically it's it's
[31:18] it's about that uh and you know as I
[31:22] mentioned before uh the elites and the
[31:25] governments uh that are owered they
[31:28] don't want that the violence stops
[31:31] because uh that's how they G money right
[31:34] to doing some word but no people inab
[31:37] are actually really happy with him
[31:40] even in the outside elab we are really
[31:43] happy because we we know our history so
[31:45] we know what we have suffered and we
[31:48] have seen the improvements you know so
[31:49] that's why he's so popular I'm super
[31:52] excited to announce that this podcast
[31:54] got the first ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is
[31:59] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[32:02] and preach self- custody this is my go
[32:05] to exchange when someone asks me oh
[32:08] where can I buy my Bitcoin from this is
[32:10] the easiest entry for bitcoiners and if
[32:13] you want lower fees Plus at the same
[32:16] time support this podcast use code Robin
[32:19] and click the link in the description
[32:21] yeah I think it's also fascinating that
[32:24] the murder rate is going down and it's
[32:28] came from one of the worst to one of the
[32:30] best murder rates it's like a really
[32:32] safe country now I had I had people on
[32:35] that live in El Salvador where they
[32:37] moved in 2021 there and back then they
[32:41] said almost every store had guards of
[32:45] their own and slowly slowly they watched
[32:48] that the guards in front of the stores
[32:50] got less and less and even uh almost no
[32:54] guards at all at some stores and this
[32:57] get got better and better with every
[32:59] step of the way and those are just some
[33:02] small uh metrics you can look at uh oh
[33:06] murderate is falling guards are less
[33:08] people can finally let their uh Sons and
[33:12] Daughters out and play without having to
[33:15] like oh [ __ ] what happens when someone
[33:18] steps to death like this like it it's it
[33:22] it obviously when you live in a country
[33:25] where um there is is Extreme violence it
[33:29] needs extreme measurements uh to uh go
[33:33] against those extreme violence and I
[33:36] think a lot of people in in Germany
[33:39] Austria it's like in this Western ham
[33:41] also in America uh they they cannot
[33:44] imagine that because uh they don't have
[33:48] that kind of violence uh in their
[33:50] countries I don't know how it's in
[33:52] America actually but Austria Germany is
[33:53] really peaceful like uh if something
[33:56] happen happens everybody talks about it
[33:58] but it rarely something happens actually
[34:01] um so I think this is what a lot of
[34:05] people
[34:07] um maybe don't understand if you have
[34:10] such an extreme situation with such a
[34:12] high murder it you have to put some
[34:15] extreme measurements and with the
[34:16] tattoos it's so easy also I don't know
[34:18] the whole gang history and if everyone
[34:21] has it and stuff like that but I I
[34:24] assume it is like that and yeah and I
[34:26] think Sal is also unique because it's
[34:28] like a kind of a window of a Bitcoin
[34:32] standard how will a Bitcoin standard
[34:33] look like and you're now in in Spain
[34:36] right yeah and will you like do you have
[34:40] plans like when you when you like do you
[34:44] lift them back to El Salvador are you
[34:46] moving back what's your plan for for
[34:48] living in El
[34:49] Salvador yeah so because of because of
[34:52] the podcast you know
[34:54] um uh most most of the people that are
[34:57] interviewed on you know sabad or as it
[35:00] happened to you that you know people
[35:01] that were here in Europe or in the
[35:03] United States are moving back to elabor
[35:06] so yeah uh uh personally yeah I I want
[35:09] to move but not um immediately because
[35:13] there's a lot of things to do but I want
[35:15] to do it by Seasons you know so like
[35:17] spend like three months there and U and
[35:22] uh to enjoy um the good weather because
[35:26] right now for example right now it's a
[35:28] good timing because we're in Winter and
[35:30] you know sa it's summer right now uh but
[35:34] um I also want to enjoy all the Bitcoin
[35:38] conference because you know you know
[35:40] United States is super close so uh we
[35:43] can go to Paci Pacific Bitcoin and and
[35:46] you know the the Bitcoin conference uh
[35:49] that happened there also or on
[35:51] conference that that happens there and
[35:53] also the ones that are in South America
[35:55] so that's I think my plan to go for
[35:58] Seasons uh stay there like three months
[36:00] four months and and then moving back uh
[36:03] so yeah because um I also love here and
[36:08] I have friends and family here uh so you
[36:12] know it's it's hard to balance and uh I
[36:15] have the the bless that also my parents
[36:18] come here a lot so yeah uh I think
[36:22] personally when my parents don't come
[36:24] here I I will go there and spend some
[36:27] time and and uh do you in my podcast or
[36:31] maybe do it in person with the because I
[36:33] usually do it like like us here
[36:36] virtually but yeah just uh go to the sa
[36:41] because I know several subor even
[36:43] friends that they're thinking to go back
[36:46] then when you when you hear personally I
[36:49] have friends that I remember that we had
[36:52] this Stu like way before like five years
[36:54] ago and um we're thinking like are you
[36:58] coming are you going back um and at any
[37:01] point of your life life and she were
[37:04] super secure and she said like no of
[37:07] course we were talking before everything
[37:09] that happened and last year I think we
[37:13] had this conversation and and I asked
[37:15] the same question and and she told me
[37:18] like yeah absolutely I I'll thinking
[37:21] about it I don't know if I'm moving but
[37:23] I I just like me you know like go for
[37:25] season or or staying here uh sorry or or
[37:30] staying there on definitely because I
[37:34] think her work remotely so she can
[37:35] manage somehow but uh so yeah but that's
[37:39] what the effect of Salvador and uh it's
[37:43] what what we are thinking you know
[37:44] because it's safe in AB is a beautiful
[37:47] country super beautiful uh we have a a
[37:50] lot of Nature and the people so friendly
[37:53] so the the only thing that we we didn't
[37:56] had it was the security and so you know
[38:00] by that time people were thinking like
[38:02] uh if they were entrepreneurs or they
[38:04] want to be Freelancers or to build their
[38:06] own small businesses they were thinking
[38:08] okay I'm going to put my business but
[38:10] why if they're they will come up again
[38:12] member and put me they were Char me with
[38:15] uh uh well in Sal it's called Renta and
[38:19] Renta was the they were uh extortion you
[38:23] to pay some
[38:24] money uh so they were like came better
[38:27] able not doing it but now we have
[38:29] security so we have opportunity and we
[38:31] have Bitcoin so we have security and we
[38:33] have the a financial tool that it can
[38:34] help us to to improve so yeah it's a
[38:37] good timing to go to
[38:38] salador I also think it's an amazing
[38:41] sign also for El salador that people
[38:44] that uh lived there moved out said that
[38:47] they don't want to move back they want
[38:48] to stay there and then all of the sudden
[38:51] a lot of things are happening and
[38:52] they're like reconsidering moving back
[38:54] to salit and it it it's it's a great
[38:57] metric to see how uh amazing El Salvador
[39:00] is doing on a Bitcoin standard and I
[39:04] always say Bitcoin is good for business
[39:06] uh no matter if it's a personal business
[39:08] like yourself uh is good if you have
[39:10] Bitcoin it's good for actual business if
[39:13] you're a company putting on a pent sheet
[39:15] making advertisement with it whatever
[39:17] and it's also seemingly good for
[39:19] countries and that's the whole game
[39:21] theory about and I'm curious now about
[39:24] how do you see um Bitcoin
[39:27] how is Bitcoin a success in 20 years
[39:30] like if you look in out in like 10 20
[39:33] years um how does Bitcoin look that you
[39:37] are saying oh Bitcoin is actually a
[39:40] success it's a success story are we
[39:42] accepting in every store are we using in
[39:45] a media exchange is it the whole unit of
[39:47] account thing what what do you see
[39:49] Bitcoin succeeding
[39:50] at in El Salvador right or do you mean
[39:53] in El Salvador but I think also like
[39:57] maybe it's more in all the the countries
[39:59] but yeah especially in so I think in in
[40:03] in 20 years I think it will
[40:06] be I can I can bet and we can see what
[40:09] happened in we will rewatch this episode
[40:13] but yeah I can bet that
[40:15] mostly um the the entire country will be
[40:18] using Bitcoin I think because the as I
[40:22] mentioned the adoption is happening
[40:23] slowly but it's happening and it's
[40:25] spreading little by
[40:27] and you know more companies are building
[40:30] are moving actually to sub um to to
[40:35] develop their own businesses there it's
[40:37] quite easier they want to live in a
[40:39] Bitcoin standard uh because uh it's way
[40:44] it's way easier to to do basically
[40:46] everything and to not depend on the on
[40:48] the dollars and inflation and the banks
[40:51] you can have your own money and you I
[40:54] think you will feel that
[40:56] is yours you know so it's yours and
[41:00] salvadorians as I mentioned there
[41:03] everyone is open to listen about Bitcoin
[41:06] they just there's so the thing is that
[41:10] right now we don't have enough people
[41:12] that are giving education still there
[41:15] are a lot of Institutions but we need
[41:16] still more people educating about
[41:18] Bitcoin but when that happen in the 20
[41:21] years uh it's a long period we will see
[41:23] exis and I think that we see people
[41:26] using it as any other currency like
[41:29] right now we have dollars and and
[41:31] Bitcoin but before that we had col
[41:34] Colonus it was our currency and dollars
[41:37] so I think that people will be using it
[41:40] um as easy as we can use it that as the
[41:43] dollar or or the colon in the past uh
[41:46] because again uh right now uh and as I
[41:50] told you before they're securing the
[41:52] future with the schools and the kids are
[41:55] the futures so if and of course they
[41:58] knew they know the te the technology way
[42:01] better than we used to and of course our
[42:04] generation our parents felt that we were
[42:08] so used to use the computers even back
[42:11] then they were so easy but I think it's
[42:13] the same in the same way they're feeling
[42:16] they're doing it with Bitcoin and uh I
[42:21] know that Bitcoin by that time in 20
[42:24] years won't be Al sub won't be the only
[42:27] country that it will be using it as
[42:29] legal tender there are right now while
[42:32] we speak countries that are planning to
[42:35] use Bitcoin as a legal tender I know
[42:38] people from jentry that they told me
[42:40] that they were in several countries um
[42:43] in Latin America or countries not
[42:46] necessarily Latin America but countries
[42:48] that have high inflation and they are
[42:51] doing everything in their power to help
[42:53] them and of course in those countries r
[42:56] that they have high inflation that are
[42:59] of course uh Bitcoin educational
[43:02] institution that that are own their owns
[43:07] and that are working to somehow escape
[43:10] from that hyperinflation so I know that
[43:13] sa won't be the the last country uh
[43:16] using Bitcoin it's just the first one
[43:19] yeah it's uh it will triggle down to
[43:22] every County eventually it's it's we at
[43:25] this point where we can confidently say
[43:27] it's an avable it will come and we it's
[43:31] like watching last night's game with
[43:33] knowing who won and it's Bitcoin and
[43:36] it's still a lot of fun to
[43:38] watch yeah of course um um you made a
[43:44] lot of podcasts already like you have as
[43:46] you said I think the one year
[43:47] anniversary for your Bitcoin podcast um
[43:51] and you also had like a really cool
[43:52] guests on bigger ones smaller ones all
[43:55] over the the place um so you know a lot
[43:58] about Bitcoin as in general what did you
[44:01] what what would you say are those main
[44:04] learnings you had or did you learn
[44:06] something new from interviewing so many
[44:09] bitcoiners and the getting the different
[44:11] kind of perspectives on bitcoin into it
[44:15] like what do what do your learnings from
[44:17] the Bitcoin
[44:18] podcast yeah so that's a good question
[44:21] actually you know when I started the
[44:24] podcast I wanted to do a podcast that I
[44:26] want to consume and hopefully the the
[44:29] viewers will also love it and uh and
[44:34] little by little I
[44:36] was uh so first I want to sh to shout
[44:39] out actually to Julian linard that he's
[44:41] the CEO of relay and Natalie reenel and
[44:44] Lena sa they were my very first guest in
[44:47] the podcast thanks to them uh that's how
[44:50] I started uh so I'm very grateful with
[44:52] them um so yeah so the idea of the
[44:56] podcast it was to have big personalities
[45:00] like you know like Jeff fot natal
[45:03] molinsky because they know a lot about
[45:05] Bitcoin precisely we need uh their
[45:09] education their own project their own
[45:12] thesis uh in our language because we
[45:15] need that people know about uh this
[45:17] thing that is happening about Bitcoin
[45:19] because Bitcoin as you know it's way
[45:21] deeper it's not just a currency that we
[45:23] can use it's a whole thing so
[45:26] so uh you start uh learning about those
[45:30] things when you go deeper and uh the
[45:34] main idea of the show is to have those
[45:36] personalities but also have a small
[45:38] communities or small uh Bitcoin
[45:41] educational programs like Bitcoin Berlin
[45:43] that they are just starting of me
[45:46] Bitcoin that are the ones that are
[45:48] leading the Bitcoin education in Els
[45:50] salador and or even not necessarily from
[45:54] El salador but from that Latin America
[45:56] that maybe they are I don't know
[45:59] Freelancers or they are Tik tokers or
[46:02] they they just have a good story about
[46:05] Bitcoin that happened in Latin America
[46:07] uh thanks to bitcoin and and you know
[46:10] like to have all these kind of voices in
[46:13] different um areas of perspective of
[46:17] lives so you can see that uh a huge
[46:21] company like micro stry are adopting
[46:24] Bitcoin and they're doing what they're
[46:26] doing they have this all this program
[46:28] and you know um or even Max Geiser that
[46:32] is building with Hon Martini this
[46:35] volcano and volcano energy there's going
[46:38] to be uh this fascinating um minor
[46:42] company that will work in salador using
[46:45] volcano energy or even the um people
[46:49] from South America that uh that you know
[46:53] they know stories about small
[46:54] communities that are used
[46:56] um
[46:58] Bitcoin and uh but they didn't have Bank
[47:01] services but now they somehow because
[47:03] someone uh just randomly talked about
[47:06] Bitcoin to them they now are using it
[47:09] for their small businesses and now they
[47:11] somehow has this to that where they can
[47:14] save some money and uh so yeah I'm
[47:19] learning a lot and I I I don't know if I
[47:22] have like an specific topic about it but
[47:24] it's super fascin I think the blessing
[47:27] of us like being podcasters is that in
[47:30] every single episode we learn something
[47:32] new even something that uh you haven't
[47:35] prepared or her before or even in the
[47:38] during the conversation you hear
[47:40] something that was like okay I didn't
[47:42] know about that and you go deeper and I
[47:44] think that's the beauty of Bitcoin that
[47:47] you just go deeper and deeper and I
[47:50] think this is like for me is super uh
[47:55] super fun and and thank God I I can live
[47:58] and do this for I can do the podcast for
[48:01] my living because I'm learning I'm
[48:03] enjoying it and I also know that uh me
[48:07] and and you and all the podcaster and
[48:09] everyone that make content about Bitcoin
[48:11] uh we're providing good education and
[48:14] people are learning what we all learning
[48:16] so the listeners are not just the one
[48:18] that are learning we also learn it so I
[48:21] think it's a blessing to do this yeah
[48:23] it's it's it's it's definitely
[48:26] something amazing and uh fascinating for
[48:30] me is also when you talk with guests
[48:33] they bringing their own views and their
[48:36] own um beliefs in the
[48:38] podcast and you're learning about so
[48:41] many different
[48:42] perspectives on different subjects even
[48:46] going Beyond
[48:47] Bitcoin uh and all the news things like
[48:50] if there's something new coming up uh uh
[48:53] I learn so much on the uh Bitcoin
[48:56] podcast that it's it's crazy I always
[48:59] had the feeling oh I have to research
[49:01] more about Bitcoin I want to do learn
[49:02] about this and this and that and it's
[49:04] kind of like oh my podcast that I do
[49:07] actually is right now uh one of the
[49:10] biggest sources of education for myself
[49:14] uh I still try to uh read books to read
[49:17] through Twitter read through the news
[49:18] read through everything uh but the
[49:20] podcast it's like um I do the podcast
[49:24] now every day and publish five times a
[49:26] week and I want to publish like every
[49:28] single day a podcast that's my goal uh
[49:32] to have like a every single day one
[49:34] podcast out uh
[49:37] and if you have one hour every day where
[49:40] you listen to someone in the sphere that
[49:43] tells you uh what they are thinking
[49:45] about the topics and you researched
[49:47] before about them so you can ask
[49:49] specific questions to them and then
[49:52] afterwards you have to edit it you have
[49:54] to look through it you have to click
[49:55] lips things out you learn that topic
[49:59] that the guest brings in in such a deep
[50:02] deep fashion that it's fascinating for
[50:04] me uh and I'm a conversational guy like
[50:08] when I speak about something I learn it
[50:10] really quickly if I just uh hear it it's
[50:14] it's it's harder if I just read it it's
[50:17] harder uh if I have it in a conversation
[50:19] and I speak about it it sticks with me
[50:21] for a very long time like I if I speak
[50:24] about something I know then uh so for
[50:27] me I will do that even if I don't get
[50:31] paid at all till I'm
[50:34] dead absolutely and actually you know
[50:36] what you were saying is that that's
[50:38] something that I also focus on my
[50:40] podcast because even is a education
[50:42] Bitcoin educational podcast because we
[50:44] need education uh I also you know I I
[50:48] like to hear the back story so I I think
[50:51] in my pod like half of it is about the
[50:54] person we because I think that's
[50:57] something that I I have learned in in
[51:00] life basically that you can resonate
[51:03] with another person if you know their
[51:05] story because it's not the same that
[51:07] just come someone randomly and talk
[51:09] about something that even it's education
[51:12] or funny or whatever but if you have
[51:14] stories that can resonate with you you
[51:17] know the person so you just know uh what
[51:20] they're thinking why they and what they
[51:22] are doing it that is that you know in
[51:25] the and is that that they're not here
[51:27] just because no they have a reason and
[51:29] the reason is they backstory what they
[51:31] have uh been doing what they have been
[51:34] suffering of what they have any
[51:36] experience that they have in life
[51:38] positive or negative um they have
[51:40] something to tell and somehow they have
[51:42] found something in Bitcoin that that is
[51:45] this tool that can allow them to express
[51:48] in whatever way you know that uh about
[51:51] their lives of what they're doing so so
[51:53] yeah it's it's it's super fascinating
[51:55] yeah and also the um point that you have
[51:58] and
[52:00] concentrated a focused uh conversation
[52:03] with another human being uh over an hour
[52:07] where there is no phone there is no
[52:09] other friends there is no uh waitress
[52:13] coming and G giving you something in
[52:16] between there there's nothing there
[52:18] there's just two people staring each
[52:20] each other uh and they know they are
[52:22] being watched afterwards so they have to
[52:24] be focused have to be right here in the
[52:26] moment and they're talking with each
[52:28] other and it's um alone for that I would
[52:31] do it even if it's not recorded because
[52:34] it's not working if it's not recorded
[52:36] because then the focus is not as hard
[52:38] here uh and that's a fascinating thing
[52:41] for me podcasting in itself I can I can
[52:44] highly recommend to everybody just do it
[52:46] even if you don't want to do it even if
[52:49] you just do it once a month even if you
[52:51] just do it like every second month
[52:53] because this one conversation with uh uh
[52:57] those those people will bring you
[52:59] further ahead yeah it's it's it's
[53:01] fascinating for me but uh absolutely um
[53:04] we are having an end routine in the
[53:06] podcast because we are
[53:08] already so far with the time it's it's
[53:11] fascinating how fast the time is always
[53:13] moving the previous guest asked a
[53:16] question for the next guest uh without
[53:18] knowing who's the next guest actually is
[53:21] sometimes they ask me sometimes I tell
[53:23] them I should not but the bru guest uh
[53:27] uh did not uh know uh like he he he does
[53:31] not um know that you and my next guest
[53:34] um and the question is a very technical
[53:37] one I usually get like uh General uh
[53:40] questions then sometimes I get funny
[53:42] questions sometimes I get related
[53:45] questions like it's it's all over the
[53:47] place uh and this question wasn't really
[53:50] technical one but there's actually a
[53:52] movie uh about that coming out also uh
[53:58] really controversial one even and it's a
[54:02] question uh were from Chris from cedo
[54:05] and he posted that question on his uh
[54:09] account and
[54:11] 61% had like an answer that was actually
[54:15] wrong and I think uh it's an it's an
[54:18] interesting for experiment also to go
[54:20] through and he asked can every Satoshi
[54:23] be traced back to
[54:25] originating block like is it possible uh
[54:29] to see uh if you have a satosi can you
[54:33] go back to the whole uh originating
[54:37] block uh I think yeah you can you can do
[54:40] that yeah it's actually fascinating
[54:42] because I thought so too for a long
[54:45] period of time H and it's not it's
[54:48] actually like sometimes you can
[54:50] sometimes you cannot uh because uh you
[54:53] can have like multiple inputs with the
[54:55] utxos uh and the thing is that you
[54:58] cannot guarantee like it's like an a
[55:02] tree where you have uh inputs and you
[55:05] have trees and they're going in
[55:06] different routes and you cannot know for
[55:09] sure if that satosi is coming from from
[55:13] that like there there can be so many
[55:15] ways that you cannot know for sure I
[55:17] mean obviously that's the whole uh thing
[55:20] of uh coin analysis because you want to
[55:23] see okay where's this coin coming from
[55:26] uh and then there's coin joins that try
[55:29] to make so many inputs they're trying to
[55:32] make so many uh confusions in a
[55:35] transaction that you cannot break it and
[55:39] uh I mean there are the beliefs that no
[55:42] matter how many coin trins you do
[55:45] sometimes you can break it and we have
[55:47] examples of coin TRS being broken and
[55:49] being uh uh moved back but this was
[55:53] basically his answer
[55:55] I'm not a software developer I'm not
[55:58] really deep in uh I'm I'm actually a
[56:00] software developer but I'm not so deep
[56:02] in the Bitcoin code so those questions
[56:05] and those uh thought experiments are
[56:08] always interesting for me and something
[56:10] I also have to look way deeper into it
[56:14] yeah absolutely no you know what I I
[56:15] answer yeah because I had some uh
[56:18] similar conversation with some friends
[56:21] last year but we were talking about uh
[56:26] uh what is the name of this thing that
[56:28] they were trying to do or still trying
[56:30] to do that they want to do to attach
[56:32] jpeg with with the satosi I don't
[56:35] remember the name or the ordinals you
[56:36] mean yeah the ordinals yeah so you know
[56:39] there's a whole discussion about that
[56:41] and we were discussing about it and they
[56:44] kind of knew about this and they were
[56:46] talking about that yeah you can trace
[56:49] somehow because they say but I don't
[56:51] know if it is true because I never did
[56:53] my own research but I just thought
[56:54] thought it was super curious that they
[56:56] told me that uh um and I I don't
[57:00] remember how it was related to to
[57:02] ordinal but they told me that there some
[57:05] because right now there are a lot of uh
[57:08] you know a lot of Bitcoin in in the
[57:10] network spread and used and going back
[57:13] and forward uh that probably um some of
[57:18] this the Sates that that you have or any
[57:22] other person have belongs uh they were
[57:25] used by the by Satoshi nak and they were
[57:31] called like rare satosi um because you
[57:35] know maybe he did a transaction these
[57:37] transactions go to other transaction and
[57:39] right now we have made like billions of
[57:41] transaction of Bitcoin so of course it's
[57:43] like the lottery that you have this rare
[57:46] satachi it can happen or cannot but you
[57:49] can have this rare satosi that maybe
[57:52] Satoshi Nakamoto made his own on
[57:55] transaction but I don't know if that's
[57:57] true or not because again it was just a
[57:59] conversation with the friends and it
[58:00] didn't make my own research so maybe
[58:03] someone know about this leave it in the
[58:05] comments make a discussion because I
[58:06] don't know that's also important always
[58:08] to say like it's uh nobody in Bitcoin
[58:12] knows everything about Bitcoin and
[58:14] that's the beauty of it and we everyone
[58:17] is on their own Learning Journey and I
[58:22] sometimes post about really beginner uh
[58:25] questions on my Twitter uh especially
[58:27] when it was like on Reddit and there was
[58:29] a big discussion about it I'm like
[58:31] reposting it from Reddit and making my
[58:33] own comments about it and I think we
[58:36] always have to be really inclusive about
[58:38] everything I try to make also the
[58:41] podcast so that someone that just stamed
[58:44] upon the podcast uh in in the first like
[58:48] RIT Hole uh sphere and entry that he can
[58:52] still watch it and can still enjoy it
[58:54] and can still go further down the rabbit
[58:56] hole I don't want an a technical podcast
[59:01] or like really deep into that level uh
[59:04] where like only uh 1% of all the
[59:08] bitcoiners even understand it uh that's
[59:11] also interesting and fun and there are
[59:12] podcasts out there uh but I want to make
[59:15] a podcast for people uh to listen to
[59:20] that they can rely on if there's some
[59:23] top different difficult topic I will ask
[59:26] for explanation for it I had something
[59:28] on Lightning a few few weeks ago and I
[59:32] asked so many beginner questions
[59:34] beginner questions I knew but I knew
[59:37] there was someone watching that does not
[59:39] know uh and so we all always have to be
[59:44] cautious about that we don't make an
[59:47] completely uh inside a podcast and try
[59:51] to make it open and
[59:53] inclusive absolutely yeah actually no
[59:57] just funny to say that I I do the same
[60:00] thing well actually in my podcast we
[60:01] have this trivia section and I also do
[60:04] the same thing uh that I make like a
[60:06] introduction question about about
[60:08] Bitcoin because you know uh as you um
[60:13] because it's it's made for sarian
[60:15] Spanish speakers maybe uh there are be
[60:18] there will be a lot of subance that
[60:21] probably they were hearing by the first
[60:23] time something related to bitcoin that
[60:24] for us is so obvious but when we were
[60:27] starting our B we were like okay I
[60:29] didn't know about that like just a
[60:31] simple what is a or something like that
[60:33] and then I have like other two questions
[60:36] that is one of General culture about uh
[60:39] anything could be basically and uh and
[60:43] the other one is about elabor that just
[60:46] people know a little bit about salador
[60:47] and it could be like uh I don't know
[60:50] anything related to to sa and uh I
[60:54] because that's a way that people can
[60:56] learn also not just about Bitcoin but
[60:59] about s yeah very very true um where can
[61:04] people find you the best where can
[61:06] people uh your find your podcast uh the
[61:09] best where can people reach out to you
[61:11] and like get in contact with you yeah
[61:13] absolutely so they can go to basically
[61:17] my my Twitter X account uh so it's uh
