[00:00] for enterprises is to have like and also
[00:02] the decentralized aspect of Bitcoin
[00:04] because geopolitical events are going to
[00:06] happen or not. There's a lot of
[00:07] uncertainty. You know, markets don't
[00:09] like uncertainty. They like clarity.
[00:11] They like, you know, have the effects.
[00:13] Bitcoin actually generates effects. You
[00:16] know, the protocol is it's clear as day
[00:18] how how Bitcoin works. There's no there
[00:20] no surprises. Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn't
[00:23] surprise you in that matter, right?
[00:24] Bitcoin surprising maybe in in terms of
[00:27] adoption companies you know reaching out
[00:29] to us um adopting Bitcoin let's say and
[00:32] and and use Bitcoin for treasury
[00:34] strategy purposes mainly at the moment
[00:36] and this adoption to see and and how it
[00:39] plays out is extremely fascinating
[00:41] perceive Bitcoin as as a store of wealth
[00:45] to pass on into the next
[00:47] [Music]
[00:50] generation. Before we get started, um,
[00:53] what are you currently doing in in
[00:55] Bitcoin and and give us some some
[00:56] backgrounds what you're doing? Um, I'm
[00:58] working as a business development
[00:59] manager for Coinfinity. So, Coinfinity
[01:02] is like the oldest Bitcoin broke in
[01:03] Austria and actually one of the first in
[01:05] Europe. So, uh, we started in 2014.
[01:09] Matter of fact, back then, nobody
[01:10] actually knew, you know, what what the
[01:12] what the history of Bitcoin would look
[01:14] like, what the future would look like.
[01:16] And, uh, yeah, we offer uh, like we are
[01:19] like kind of like a gateway. We are
[01:21] broker where people and also companies
[01:23] can buy and sell bitcoin of course
[01:26] rather people buy bitcoin rather than
[01:28] selling bitcoin. Um and yeah and
[01:30] particularly for for um companies it is
[01:33] very we have a very interesting
[01:34] infrastructure to to onboard also
[01:36] companies. Really cool it's it's super
[01:38] interesting when we talk about
[01:40] businesses because it it seems like this
[01:43] has been now a topic especially since
[01:45] 2020 in the public eye because of micro
[01:47] strategy. It was a topic way before then
[01:50] because uh Micros was not the first
[01:52] company just the first publicly traded
[01:54] company in America. Um what is kind of
[01:56] the the current state of companies
[02:00] adopting Bitcoin and and how fast and
[02:03] how easy it is to to onboard them? Is is
[02:06] there like similar challenges to Orange
[02:08] Build them than with individuals? It's a
[02:10] pretty good question actually. I mean
[02:11] you know I'm with Conffinity since
[02:14] 2023. Um and I remember pretty clearly
[02:17] back then uh we did a lot of of
[02:19] proactive work I would say to approach
[02:22] businesses right and to approach
[02:24] entrepreneurs. Um but then something
[02:27] actually like there was like something
[02:29] like like a shift uh coming up with with
[02:32] the uh with the approval of the Bitcoin
[02:35] spot in the US in January
[02:37] 2024. And this was um I would say like
[02:41] an interesting moment to witness because
[02:44] you know as soon as the uh Bitcoin
[02:46] spotted devs have been approved back
[02:48] then um we saw the interest from
[02:52] companies towards Bitcoin and therefore
[02:54] towards our services increased
[02:56] significantly. And now we have
[02:59] uh a lot of a lot of new clients uh you
[03:02] know coming in daily uh companies from
[03:05] the German speaking countries uh you
[03:07] know Austria, Germany of course is a
[03:09] very strong country with lots of clients
[03:11] from Germany of course also Switzerland
[03:13] but also from other EU countries but you
[03:15] know like what what I think is very um
[03:18] very inspiring to see is um companies
[03:21] you know reaching out to us um adopting
[03:24] Pitco let's say uh and and use Bitcoin
[03:26] for treasury strategy purposes mainly at
[03:29] the moment and this uh and this uh uh uh
[03:33] adoption to see and and how it plays out
[03:35] is extremely fascinating. So it's more
[03:38] it's already kind of flipping of more
[03:39] and more companies coming uh to you and
[03:41] and and less and less well you have to
[03:44] code approach them and like hey there's
[03:45] Bitcoin as an option. Exactly. At the
[03:47] moment actually we are exactly exactly
[03:49] right there in the spot where where
[03:51] companies approaching us. I mean we we
[03:53] did a lot and and we try to to uh
[03:56] educate we try to you know we try to
[03:58] distribute information around around
[04:00] Bitcoin and you know how Bitcoin can
[04:02] improve your company uh and your your
[04:05] liquidity management for example right
[04:08] um but of course um you cannot force the
[04:11] idea out there right you have to you
[04:13] have to give them time um you have to um
[04:16] you have to you have to clarify you have
[04:18] to uh put out information there um and
[04:20] uh I think we do a great shop. Also, the
[04:22] the whole marketing team at Confinity is
[04:24] doing a great job, you know, with with
[04:26] all the uh with all the with all the um
[04:28] engagement that we're doing with the
[04:30] community. Um we try to uh we try to
[04:32] interact with our community very very
[04:34] actively. We try to educate about
[04:36] Bitcoin in a very simple way so that
[04:39] everybody you know like can can foot in
[04:41] and and and is can start to learn about
[04:43] Bitcoin. And when it comes to
[04:45] enterprises and companies, um mainly
[04:48] they have a pretty pretty good idea what
[04:50] Bitcoin is. uh most of them they
[04:53] actually kind like know what they want
[04:55] when they approach us when they approach
[04:57] me. Um I don't have to let's say orange
[05:00] pill them or something like that. I
[05:01] don't have to you know like uh plant an
[05:03] idea in their head it it comes from from
[05:05] them which is extremely fascinating to
[05:08] see and also you know when you take a
[05:10] look uh who are those companies or or
[05:13] from which industry they're coming there
[05:15] are so many great stories I could I I
[05:17] can't tell and I will tell today but
[05:19] yeah it's extremely fascinating what we
[05:21] are seeing and you know also for me it
[05:22] is very interesting to see that uh that
[05:25] you see the bitcoin adoption in terms of
[05:27] uh enterprises embracing bitcoin I see
[05:29] it in the first row uh and is actually
[05:31] happening. Interesting. You you said one
[05:34] thing uh how Bitcoin can help uh
[05:36] liquidity managing management. What is
[05:39] that like how can Bitcoin help that um
[05:42] you know like liquidity for for
[05:43] enterprising companies particularly for
[05:45] for small and medium-sized companies is
[05:49] extremely important. You know like a
[05:50] company can survive let's say a certain
[05:53] time span without rentability right but
[05:55] they cannot survive without liquidity.
[05:58] So they have to have liquidity. They
[05:59] have to have a certain a certain um tool
[06:03] or um a certain technique to store
[06:06] liquidity and have liquidity accessible
[06:08] at any given moment when we need it. Um
[06:11] and we see particularly in you know the
[06:13] small and medium-sized companies uh
[06:16] which are actually the backbone of of
[06:18] our economy uh in in Europe in general.
[06:21] Um those are actually the companies who
[06:23] are who are thinking twice if they uh
[06:26] interact in Bitcoin, if they buy
[06:28] Bitcoin, if they put Bitcoin uh in in
[06:31] the Treasury strategic uh and and uh and
[06:34] and following a Bitcoin reserve strategy
[06:37] by themselves uh which is very inspiring
[06:40] and also um you know those are like
[06:43] familyowned businesses in the second or
[06:45] third generation. Um so they have uh
[06:49] experience. They have um a certain need
[06:52] and urgency to uh also you know
[06:56] transport their innovative companies or
[06:59] the innovative business into the future.
[07:02] And therefore, you know, Bitcoin is is
[07:04] uh one one tool to guarantee to to you
[07:09] know, like to to save um uh your whole
[07:12] innovation and what you have ever worked
[07:13] for um and to monetarize it and to save
[07:16] it for the long term. And that's
[07:17] actually what Bitcoin uh fulfills pretty
[07:20] pretty nicely. It's it's also
[07:21] interesting when we think about small
[07:23] and mediumsiz business, familyowned
[07:25] businesses versus like a micro strategy.
[07:28] Um how different is that? like are the
[07:32] same concept that we know and uh
[07:34] probably the audience knows a lot about
[07:36] how Micro Strategy is doing it because
[07:38] there are so many podcasts around that
[07:40] topic but there are not a lot of
[07:41] podcasts on how like a medium-sized
[07:43] family-owned business adopts Bitcoin.
[07:45] What are the the differences there? But
[07:47] the differences are are for me are
[07:49] definitely you know the volume of course
[07:51] right I mean like if you take a look at
[07:53] if you take a look at all the family
[07:54] owned businesses small and mediumsized
[07:56] and uh you know businesses u of course
[08:00] most of them we're talking about like uh
[08:02] a certain portion of the liquidity that
[08:04] are that they are you know like putting
[08:06] into Bitcoin nobody's uh nobody has has
[08:10] false expectations or or or try to to
[08:14] leverage uh Bitcoin within the company
[08:16] or try to be risky. It's actually the
[08:18] opposite. Um you know they are very very
[08:21] levelheaded. I would say companies are
[08:23] very levelheaded. So they they make
[08:25] decisions where they anticipate um you
[08:28] know a certain advantage for them. Um
[08:31] meaning that if if if you if you take a
[08:34] look um in family businesses they have
[08:36] to or in general businesses they have to
[08:39] run businesses have to run. You cannot
[08:41] compromise for example uh any strategic
[08:45] decision. You you cannot allow that to
[08:47] happen that that this is going to
[08:48] compromise your your business. You have
[08:50] to be you have to be accountable. You
[08:51] have to follow up on on on on the
[08:54] revenue stream. You have to follow up on
[08:56] you know like for for the employees. You
[08:58] have to have your financial situation in
[09:01] in place and in order. But there's still
[09:03] a certain position um of of liquidity on
[09:07] the sideline. Um and they are some of
[09:11] them are actually like desperately
[09:13] looking for any alternative to use
[09:16] excessive liquidity and and and and and
[09:19] try to find solutions how to store
[09:22] excessive liquidity uh in order to u in
[09:25] order to have like the the the power um
[09:28] of um of their of their wealth stored
[09:31] into the future. And Bitcoin is actually
[09:33] um in my opinion the only the only asset
[09:36] class that ensures that you can actually
[09:38] transport your wealth and and your
[09:41] purchasing power into the future. And
[09:43] for companies that's actually what is
[09:45] very important because they have to they
[09:48] have to make sure um that they save uh
[09:52] their their their liquidity for the
[09:54] future. They have to reinvest. Some of
[09:57] them, some companies of them for
[09:58] example, they have to have to uh make uh
[10:02] uh reinvestments in their infrastructure
[10:04] or in their business um strategy.
[10:06] Therefore, they might need liquidity in
[10:08] the future. So, Bitcoin is like one
[10:10] liquidity tool, I would say. But um what
[10:13] is extremely interesting to see is you
[10:15] know where does this where does this um
[10:19] capital actually come from that they are
[10:22] converting into Bitcoin. you know where
[10:24] does this capital come from that they
[10:26] are going to to to transform into
[10:28] Bitcoin and the the extremely extremely
[10:32] interesting thing is that uh most of the
[10:35] entrepreneurs most of the businesses um
[10:38] of course they're using excess liquidity
[10:40] you know like cash which is waiting on
[10:42] the sideline okay um I would say this is
[10:45] like maybe let's say 40% but 60% of the
[10:48] capital that they are going to put into
[10:50] Bitcoin is actually already um in other
[10:55] asset classes in their companies. So
[10:57] meaning that for example they they're
[10:59] doing like a rebalancing I would say and
[11:02] what I'm witnessing are three trends
[11:04] clear and particularly three trends.
[11:06] Trend number one entrepreneurs companies
[11:09] they're selling they're selling real
[11:11] estate they're selling real estate by
[11:14] Bitcoin. Trend number two, they're
[11:16] selling gold, physical gold, and buy
[11:18] bitcoin. And trend number three, they're
[11:21] selling stocks or they short they
[11:23] they're cutting their their uh their
[11:26] their stock portfolio and they buy
[11:27] bitcoin. So I would say like most of the
[11:31] most of the of the companies I would say
[11:33] 60% they're making a rebalancing meaning
[11:35] that they are they are cutting uh fiat
[11:38] based uh assets uh in a certain manner
[11:41] in a certain percentage and they put the
[11:43] the capital into bitcoin and that is
[11:45] actually very fascinating because you
[11:46] have to imagine you know like
[11:48] familyowned businesses they're not like
[11:49] they're very levelheaded as I said and
[11:51] what they're doing and their their
[11:53] strategic decisions that they are making
[11:55] are very very thought through in
[11:57] particular Yeah, they deploy money. It
[11:59] has to come somewhere. Uh before
[12:02] Bitcoin, what do they do? Like then a
[12:04] company now all of a sudden similar as
[12:06] an individual has to play portfolio
[12:08] manager has to see like okay what stocks
[12:10] are we buying? What real estate are we
[12:13] developing? No, that's not how it should
[12:14] work, right? You should just do your
[12:16] company thing and have a monetary asset.
[12:19] Exactly. I think that's that's actually
[12:20] the key. I think the um you know
[12:23] entrepreneurs they should have to focus
[12:25] on what they are what what what the
[12:26] business is all about is running the
[12:28] business is developing new ideas is
[12:30] developing the business as it is
[12:32] bringing it into the future passing it
[12:33] into the next onto the next generation
[12:36] um and and having like an hedge against
[12:40] an an inflationary system where also
[12:42] maybe you have regulations to face as an
[12:44] entrepreneur as a company um I think it
[12:46] is very good to have like a certain uh a
[12:49] certain ace that you can put on the
[12:51] table when it comes to to store wealth
[12:53] for the long term on for your company.
[12:55] Interesting. What are um if you said
[12:58] they are already coming almost orange
[13:01] pill to you uh and they understand and
[13:03] they have a clear idea to Bitcoin, what
[13:06] are the the challenges the the questions
[13:08] that they they come up with? Usually
[13:10] normally they are very aware and they
[13:14] they actually know that we are of course
[13:16] have to double check them. I mean double
[13:18] check maybe is the wrong phrase but we
[13:20] have to follow up our due diligence you
[13:22] know we have uh we are we are regulated
[13:25] broker meaning we have the financial
[13:28] market authority we're listed there
[13:30] right so we have to follow up our due
[13:31] diligence um we have to check of course
[13:35] there the documents they have to pass
[13:37] certain documents on when they when they
[13:39] run through the onboarding process but
[13:40] this is something they already know of
[13:43] course and this is also pretty common
[13:45] and and a normal thing to do So um it's
[13:48] the confidential it's a confidential act
[13:50] of course to pass us also financial
[13:52] reports so that we have a chance and
[13:54] that we can follow up on the due
[13:55] diligence and also the
[13:57] anti-moneyaunderry
[13:58] uh regulations that we actually like
[14:00] check the the the company uh that is
[14:04] coming in that is actually and and that
[14:06] wants to buy Bitcoin because as I said
[14:08] before you know we have also to check
[14:10] you know where is this capital coming
[14:12] from right sometimes I I I had the uh I
[14:16] had the uh the interaction with with
[14:18] some with some entrepreneurs saying,
[14:20] "All right, Raymond C, I have €2 million
[14:24] in my bank account, right? You see €2
[14:26] million are there. I just want to buy
[14:27] Bitcoin, you know." And I said, "Okay,
[14:29] you know, it's fine. You know, of
[14:30] course, uh there are no limits. You can
[14:32] buy Bitcoin to us for 2 million, 10
[14:34] million, no problem. But um having
[14:37] having the capital sitting in your in in
[14:39] your bank account is one thing, right?
[14:41] But we have to make sure and we have to
[14:42] check, you know, how how this capital
[14:44] actually come into existence, right? It
[14:46] has to come from somewhere, right? Of
[14:47] course. So, um that's actually but but
[14:50] this is something very common and and
[14:52] companies are very very very aware of
[14:54] that. So, as I said, you know, um the
[14:57] the most easiest thing companies buy
[14:59] bitcoin is, you know, the passing the
[15:00] finan the annual financial report to us.
[15:03] We evaluate them. You say we are we are
[15:05] we're giving them um uh certain you know
[15:08] like buying limits that they can buy
[15:09] bitcoin in accordance with their
[15:11] expectations and then they just they
[15:12] follow up and buy bitcoin through us.
[15:14] It's a very simple um very simple and
[15:16] very fast uh evaluation process I would
[15:19] say. Um and I think we are super fast. I
[15:22] mean I remember we we uh went through
[15:24] the onboarding process with one company
[15:26] within within 12 hours. Um but that was
[15:29] the fastest one. Normally I would say
[15:32] when a company reaches out to us passing
[15:34] us documents you know like from the uh
[15:38] like the documents that are that are
[15:40] necessary is you know like the uh the
[15:43] certificate of the ultimate beneficial
[15:45] owners for example um uh you know as a
[15:48] financial reports you know passports and
[15:50] and and whatsoever. But um normally when
[15:53] we have all the documents together from
[15:56] the clients we we we run through the
[15:58] onboarding process meaning in between 2
[16:00] to 5 days they are good to go and they
[16:02] can buy bitcoin. Interesting. Yeah. I
[16:04] mean as a company you you anyways have
[16:06] to do that right you you for for for
[16:08] income you have to have to res uh
[16:11] receipts and for the expenses. Uh so
[16:13] they usually I mean most of them should
[16:16] have those documents ready. Yes.
[16:18] Exactly. Um but sometimes actually you
[16:20] would wonder you know some maybe you you
[16:23] will face other other expectations also
[16:26] from from from from clients right and
[16:28] from companies. It can also happen that
[16:29] maybe you know the the current annual
[16:31] financial report is not ready yet right
[16:33] and maybe you know it's ready in a few
[16:34] weeks and this actually um uh creates a
[16:38] certain delay in within the within the
[16:40] process but okay that that can happen
[16:42] but nevertheless uh you know I actually
[16:45] would say that 99% of of all the
[16:48] business owners of all the entrepreneurs
[16:50] of all the companies that are reaching
[16:51] out to us or to me you know they're very
[16:54] serious of what they are doing and they
[16:56] are also appreciate the service that we
[16:58] offer, you know, that they can rely on
[17:00] on on a regulated broker, let's say,
[17:03] where they can where they also have like
[17:05] their their statements that they also
[17:08] can uh pass their their tax advisor when
[17:10] it comes to taxes. It's extremely huge
[17:12] thing for for uh businesses, you know,
[17:15] they have so many questions of, you
[17:16] know, how how do I uh how do I uh uh um
[17:21] display Bitcoin within my balance sheet
[17:23] on the end of the year? um and they're
[17:26] also facing us or they're also like um
[17:28] putting us questions towards that. Of
[17:30] course, we cannot answer that because we
[17:32] are no tax advisor, but we we we use our
[17:34] network. We we give references, you
[17:36] know, we have a great network of of uh
[17:38] Bitcoin uh tax specialists within within
[17:42] the German speaking countries. So,
[17:44] they're very happy about that. But
[17:45] nevertheless, I would say that the uh
[17:47] the documents that we're providing in
[17:49] general are more than enough and very
[17:52] sufficient for for any tax advisor to
[17:54] work with and this is also a very um a
[17:57] very convenient um feature actually um
[18:00] that they're very satisfied with us and
[18:02] that companies highly appreciate. M
[18:04] interesting. Yeah. And in general um a
[18:07] lot of Bitcoiners are not happy about
[18:09] KYC. I mean on a company level I think
[18:11] it's it's it's uh already very like most
[18:15] companies have that companies accept KYC
[18:18] like they they have to fill out those
[18:19] those forms but on individual form how
[18:22] do you look in general at at KC you on
[18:25] with coin infinity you also regulated uh
[18:27] there's ma also now coming I don't know
[18:29] if you already in process of getting the
[18:31] the license probably uh and how do you
[18:34] look at ma EU and the KYC topics um I
[18:38] mean you know we've always followed up
[18:40] our due diligence and we have always
[18:42] been uh we've always been very proactive
[18:45] and when it comes to KYC data and and KC
[18:48] evaluations
[18:49] um you know and and as I can remember
[18:52] also you know confinity has has ever
[18:54] been very clear and very very uh very
[18:57] straightforward in terms of uh
[18:59] fulfilling every single kind of
[19:01] regulations ever since even though back
[19:03] then there was maybe you know we're
[19:05] talking about like in starting in the
[19:07] days there was maybe not so clear
[19:09] regulation framework that we that we are
[19:11] having today. Um uh but now you know
[19:14] like also um the Austrian financial uh
[19:17] market authority you know they are they
[19:18] are uh they are more aware of course
[19:22] about about Bitcoin. Um and um
[19:26] personally I think Mika
[19:29] um Mika is is one step forward um into
[19:35] into uh into the into the world where
[19:38] Bitcoin will find its way into the
[19:40] masses I would say because
[19:43] um it it it develops clear regulations
[19:46] and clear rules particularly for for the
[19:48] KBC for of of course the KYC process. Um
[19:52] for us what does it mean for us? Yeah,
[19:54] we are right in the middle of the
[19:55] process as as you mentioned that's
[19:57] that's also correct. Um but of course
[19:59] for us as soon as we are um having the
[20:03] Mika license it enables us to be
[20:05] proactive within the uh within the
[20:08] European countries or within the
[20:10] European Union so to speak, right? And
[20:12] um of course other other uh uh
[20:15] competitors will also enter the market.
[20:18] So it will be a more competitive um
[20:21] environment I would say. Um but on the
[20:24] other hand um we have a certain
[20:27] advantage uh because first of all as a
[20:30] bitcoin only broker we are very very
[20:32] straightforward where we're only
[20:33] covering bitcoin. We're not an exchange.
[20:35] We're not an multiasset platform where
[20:37] you can buy all the all the uh shitcoins
[20:39] that you might maybe find out there.
[20:41] We're very straightforward with that.
[20:42] Our clients appreciate the strategy. Um
[20:46] and I think the market is is is big
[20:48] enough for for everybody. Um and I also
[20:51] did like um I saw one one particular
[20:55] statistic that was mentioning that
[20:59] approximately 1% of allmemes
[21:03] um are either way interacting into
[21:07] Bitcoin thinking about Bitcoin or
[21:09] holding Bitcoin. So 1% of uh all the
[21:12] small and medium-sized companies um
[21:15] within the German speaking countries and
[21:18] if you put that you know into numbers
[21:21] um we are we're we're uh talking about
[21:24] 10 thousands and 10 thousands of
[21:26] potential clients out there. So I think
[21:28] um as I said the market is is big
[21:30] enough. Um Bitcoin adoption is is taking
[21:34] place. Um regulation Mika is taking
[21:37] place of course. um KYC processes for
[21:41] us. It's a it's a normal thing to to run
[21:43] through with our clients. They are
[21:45] willing to do so, of course. Um and they
[21:48] are also willing to do so because they
[21:50] want a reliable partner. You know, they
[21:51] don't want to have any um any uh uh uh
[21:56] you know like weird moment within the
[21:57] process of of of of buying Bitcoin
[21:59] somewhere. Maybe not sure if if the
[22:01] platform is is legitimate or not. Um so
[22:04] they're willing to do so and
[22:05] particularly as also you mentioned a a
[22:08] company has to has to have um also
[22:11] certain compliance guidelines within
[22:13] within their infrastructure. So they
[22:15] don't want to have experiments. They
[22:17] want to go to to a full service partner
[22:20] such as Confinity. Yeah, absolutely. You
[22:22] want to have the receipts and everything
[22:24] in place. You don't want to be on the
[22:26] bad bad side of the taxman. Um, one
[22:29] thing that I'm also wondering, um, when
[22:31] individuals come into Bitcoin and I get
[22:34] that question always from people that
[22:36] haven't had Bitcoin is the typical stock
[22:39] question of like, okay, where where can
[22:41] Bitcoin go and and what is the total
[22:42] addressable market? Like that's a
[22:44] completely normal question if you invest
[22:46] in stocks and like Bitcoin is always
[22:47] going in that direction. How often is
[22:50] that also happening with with
[22:51] businesses? Are they asking like where
[22:53] do you see Bitcoin going in the next 5
[22:55] years? Do you have to answer those
[22:56] questions? That's a funny question
[22:57] actually. Yes. I mean sometimes happens.
[22:59] I mean if I would say no it's not the
[23:01] case I would lie. It's it's it of course
[23:03] you will face the questions right. Um
[23:06] but of course I you
[23:08] know I think but the entrepreneurs you
[23:11] know and individuals they are very aware
[23:13] they they can anticipate um you know if
[23:16] you show them launching data if you if
[23:17] you if if you present information and
[23:19] data how the network is developing um
[23:21] how bitcoin uh is adopting or is is
[23:24] going to be adopted by by other
[23:26] businesses by individuals by nations. I
[23:29] I think the the calculation is pretty
[23:31] clear and
[23:32] um I have the impression that now we are
[23:36] in the phase where companies and if I
[23:40] would name the companies you would
[23:42] recognize them by the name right so
[23:44] we're not talking about like you know
[23:46] like shady companies so they are serious
[23:48] uh famous well-known companies also in
[23:51] Austria or Germany that are buying
[23:52] Bitcoin but um I think they just don't
[23:56] want to get the bet they don't want to
[23:58] have the had to say, okay, um I I
[24:00] neglect Bitcoin completely. Um you know,
[24:03] I'm fine within within my asset classes
[24:06] that I have uh in my balance sheet. I'm
[24:08] fine with that. I don't believe Bitcoin
[24:09] will will will survive. I don't think
[24:12] Bitcoin uh will will prosper in the
[24:14] future. Um they don't want to get that
[24:17] bad because at a certain point they they
[24:20] are educated that they have at least um
[24:24] that they are at least aware of of
[24:26] certain of certain attributes about
[24:28] Bitcoin. It's it's it's rare character,
[24:30] right? It it limits to to 21 million. Um
[24:34] it's decentralization aspect. So there
[24:36] are a few and a bunch of very important
[24:39] uh attributes that actually follows and
[24:41] goes and and go along with attributes
[24:44] for a perfect uh store of wealth uh
[24:48] asset and they take that bet and for
[24:51] them and for me it wouldn't be a bet at
[24:53] all anyhow, but for them maybe for for
[24:55] some companies it is a certain bet. So
[24:58] maybe they say okay you know I will
[25:00] enter with I don't know with with 1% of
[25:03] of my uh accessible liquidity into
[25:05] Bitcoin you know follow along my first
[25:07] steps and then and I think it's also
[25:10] happening with private persons so with
[25:11] individuals as soon as you as soon as
[25:14] you put your your foot into into Bitcoin
[25:16] and as soon as you getting comfortable
[25:19] with with Bitcoin studying Bitcoin and
[25:21] understanding the development and the
[25:23] potential of Bitcoin you're getting far
[25:25] more uh comfortable with with it. Um,
[25:28] and automatically you see the potential
[25:30] and you can evaluate the potential far
[25:31] even more. And the following aspect and
[25:34] the following uh uh uh moves are they
[25:37] are they wanting to save more uh more
[25:40] wealth let's say and to put then to put
[25:42] then in in the next steps more more more
[25:45] cash into Bitcoin or they buy Bitcoin
[25:46] even more or they as I said they are
[25:48] making rebalancing they are selling
[25:50] other asset classes for Bitcoin and this
[25:52] is um very very interesting to see and
[25:54] to and to witness. Um but of course
[25:57] facing the questions you know also when
[25:59] is the right time to buy right uh also
[26:02] happens happens from time to time um and
[26:06] and everybody has to decide for
[26:07] themselves. Um but I think it's also the
[26:10] question um that anybody has to has to
[26:13] ask themselves. Do I think Bitcoin will
[26:17] will stuck at the place in at at the
[26:20] level where we are at at the moment uh
[26:22] with all the news out there with all the
[26:24] economic uh circumstances that we're
[26:26] facing? Um you know paired with the with
[26:29] the attributes in Bitcoin um the
[26:32] accessibility of Bitcoin do I believe
[26:34] that this will never ever be uh evolving
[26:37] even further? I think it's a completely
[26:40] uh clear answer to that and and the
[26:43] companies are pretty pretty smart. Yeah,
[26:45] that that I also think so like they they
[26:47] they have the time and the the resources
[26:49] to to research that and it's interesting
[26:52] because um uh Black Rockck um was was
[26:57] getting the uh the perspective in of
[26:59] like it's a unique diversifier. I think
[27:01] that's what what they are also used in
[27:04] some presentations for for companies. Uh
[27:07] and I think it's a really interesting
[27:09] way to pitch it for companies that might
[27:12] not
[27:14] um might not fully be orange build or
[27:16] might not fully get it but they are like
[27:19] okay we have a set of of uh stocks we
[27:22] have a set of real estate we have a set
[27:24] of gold maybe even um okay Bitcoin would
[27:27] be probably a very unique diversifier to
[27:30] that portfolio. let's put like 1% of our
[27:32] balance sheet and 5% of our balance
[27:34] sheet in there. Uh and then as you said
[27:36] if they actually have some sort of
[27:39] exposure to Bitcoin uh the incentive for
[27:42] them personally is now to actually
[27:44] research it like even if they just put
[27:46] it as a diversifier like okay let's put
[27:49] 1% of the balance sheet in there if
[27:51] everything goes bust like there's
[27:52] nothing to lose here. Um and then the
[27:55] the research is the same with
[27:56] individuals. I see that all the time
[27:57] with friends that uh four years ago they
[28:00] bought a little. They were like, "Ah, I
[28:01] don't know if if it's really good, but
[28:03] uh I I like Robin. Let's let's buy like
[28:06] $1,000 in Bitcoin." And then I asked
[28:08] them 4 years later, "Yeah, like 50% of
[28:10] my money is in Bitcoin." And I'm like,
[28:12] like what happened? You were so you were
[28:14] so against it. Uh and I think it's
[28:16] really interesting to see the same
[28:18] process happening with with companies.
[28:21] And when you said 1% that that seems
[28:23] very low still like you said f first
[28:27] that around 1% are interested or looking
[28:29] into that um that means 99% are
[28:33] completely unaware and still sleeping
[28:35] like the whole market is open. Yeah,
[28:37] exactly. It's actually when you follow
[28:38] up the the report from River, I think it
[28:40] was where where you had like a a graph
[28:43] out there which is saying like you know
[28:45] we are now at the level like the
[28:47] internet in 1990 um or social media I
[28:50] think in in was it 2005ish something
[28:53] like that. So I I I believe that and um
[28:56] I I and I see it and this is actually
[28:58] the the the exciting part um of what
[29:00] we're doing. We are seeing um day by
[29:02] day, week by week, year by year we are
[29:04] seeing the development. Um I see it
[29:06] because I I I have to uh uh I have more
[29:10] requests. Um I work with uh more
[29:12] companies from day to day. Um and and
[29:15] you see the adoption is going to happen.
[29:17] Um and as I said now we are also at the
[29:19] stage where where uh well-known
[29:20] companies embrace Bitcoin. So uh it's
[29:23] not like um it's not like uh like years
[29:26] ago where where where nobody was
[29:28] actually interested in in in in in
[29:30] Bitcoin. Now it's actually completely
[29:32] shifting. Um and and one thing also that
[29:36] is extremely um I would say like like
[29:39] you know
[29:40] interesting compelling for them for
[29:43] enterprises is to have like an an asset
[29:46] that is and also the decentralized
[29:48] aspect of Bitcoin because you know
[29:51] nobody actually knows you know how you
[29:52] know you know the fiscal political uh
[29:56] decisions are are playing out in in the
[29:58] near future or in the distant future.
[29:59] Nobody knows actually how you know like
[30:02] geopolitical events are going to happen
[30:04] or not. There's a lot of uncertainty.
[30:06] You know markets don't like uncertainty.
[30:08] They like clarity. They like you know
[30:10] have to have facts. Bitcoin actually
[30:13] generates the facts. You know the
[30:14] protocol is it's clear as day how how
[30:17] Bitcoin works. There's no there no
[30:19] surprises. Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn't
[30:21] surprise you in that matter, right?
[30:23] Bitcoin surprise you maybe in in in
[30:24] terms of adoption. But
[30:27] um a lot of companies besides of number
[30:31] go up and to have like as I said an ace
[30:34] putting on the table and participate
[30:36] from from from uh you know the the uh
[30:39] the increasing of the purchasing power.
[30:41] They are they want to have something um
[30:44] when everything goes wrong, when
[30:46] everything, you know, when everything
[30:48] goes bad, so to speak, when they might
[30:51] be when the business might be regulated
[30:53] as hell, when they have maybe to leave
[30:56] their country, and maybe to uh migrate
[31:00] somewhere else, they want to have
[31:02] something that they can put into their
[31:04] pocket or maybe, you know, teleport,
[31:06] let's say, their their wealth in their
[31:08] head, right? that actually can Bitcoin
[31:10] ensures that and they want to be they
[31:13] want to have this flexibility to leave
[31:15] whenever they want to leave. Um and
[31:18] actually Bitcoin now I would say is
[31:21] taking this place that gold has and had
[31:24] for a very very long time. And I think
[31:26] you also hear the stories uh maybe from
[31:30] people you know saying okay if
[31:32] everything goes wrong I have like my
[31:34] gold coins and I can you know buy one
[31:36] liter of milk or bread with with my gold
[31:38] coin which is a completely insane uh
[31:41] idea and you know is a completely
[31:43] completely nonsense of course but the
[31:47] nature of of a of of a person of a
[31:49] business is also to maybe paint out even
[31:54] negative effects and to be prepared for
[31:56] that. And that's a good thing. You know,
[31:57] you you have to have a plan B. You have
[31:58] to have um a certain strategic approach
[32:01] that that plays out when things go
[32:04] wrong. And Bitcoin and having Bitcoin is
[32:07] one in my opinion an extremely important
[32:11] ace that you can play out when you have
[32:14] to have it. And there was also um one
[32:17] one company in Vienna. I read I read the
[32:19] article um in the root cast and the
[32:21] company is called Linkoders. I don't
[32:23] know if you know them. Um it's also like
[32:26] an IT company. Um and um when I do
[32:31] recall it precisely they had um uh KTM
[32:36] um as a partner. So they had they were
[32:39] um I don't know how I think they they um
[32:41] they supported um it uh services to to
[32:45] to this client and uh when they when
[32:49] they had when they were insolvent uh and
[32:51] KTM actually had financial problems,
[32:53] right? um the company was lucky to have
[32:58] like a certain stake on Bitcoin where
[33:00] they can actually like um you know like
[33:02] sell some some portions out of it to to
[33:05] ensure to have liquidity on the sideline
[33:07] to pay their employees right so it's and
[33:10] that's actually again this is this
[33:12] liquidity aspect that Bitcoin can
[33:14] generate and you see also in this case
[33:17] it's not
[33:18] about 100 year old businesses that want
[33:20] to have liquidity to evolve and maybe to
[33:22] you know like to to shift their strategy
[33:24] and maybe you know buy new machinery or
[33:26] or new technology. It's also interesting
[33:29] for startups for new companies to have
[33:32] um a certain strategic reserve when
[33:34] anything goes wrong or you have and for
[33:36] startups it's normal. I mean you know I
[33:38] think it's not easy to to establish a
[33:40] business and when when so to speak when
[33:43] when when things go wrong um you have a
[33:45] financial relief in your backpack that
[33:48] you can actually unload and I think
[33:49] that's a pretty pretty nice idea. I
[33:51] partnered up with Coin Vigilante. This
[33:54] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[33:57] that I ever saw created by anyone. Look
[34:00] at that beauty. I love it so much. Coin
[34:03] Vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch.
[34:06] That's the perfect subtle eleigent way
[34:09] to go out there and show that you are a
[34:12] Bitcoiner. And that watch brand is
[34:14] Bitcoin only. and Coin Vigilante just
[34:18] dropped a completely new and amazing
[34:20] Genesis edition of their watch
[34:23] collections. You have the date of the
[34:25] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[34:29] and of course also the block height and
[34:31] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[34:34] the level of detail they put in in this
[34:37] masterpiece. And make sure to check out
[34:40] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[34:43] down in the descriptions. I love those
[34:45] watches so so much. If you watch or
[34:49] listen to my podcast on a regular basis,
[34:51] I'll guess you already bought some
[34:53] Bitcoin. And now the most important step
[34:56] is to keep the Bitcoin. Keep them secure
[34:59] in a hardware wallet. My personal
[35:01] recommendation for hardware wallet is
[35:03] the Bit Box. It's super secure. It's
[35:05] simple to set up. It's also a perfect
[35:07] gift for a friend who has still their
[35:09] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[35:12] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[35:16] checkout. Visit
[35:19] bitbox.swiss/roin to get your Bitbox.
[35:22] And the next step is to really level up
[35:24] your sovereignty as an individual. You
[35:26] have to have the most secure
[35:28] self-custody setup. You have to secure
[35:31] your own devices. You have to protect
[35:34] your privacy. You have to set up an
[35:36] inheritance plan. And depending on where
[35:38] you live, you even want to have a plan
[35:41] B, a citizenship where you can move in
[35:44] case something goes really, really
[35:45] wrong. And through all those steps, the
[35:47] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:50] by step. And if you visit the
[35:55] bitcoinway.com/partners/roin, you even
[35:56] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[35:59] how you can level up your sovereignty.
[36:02] And that's that's uh I think the major
[36:06] idea behind Bitcoin uh for people that
[36:09] even don't like it. I think there's a a
[36:11] huge incentive even for people that
[36:14] dislike the idea of sound money. Even
[36:17] they have an huge incentive to adopt it
[36:20] in case something goes wrong. They're
[36:21] like, "Okay, uh maybe I don't like sound
[36:24] money. Maybe I like communism where
[36:26] there's centralized money and I I really
[36:29] like central banks." Like even if you're
[36:31] really into
[36:32] that, you're still very incentivized to
[36:35] get some Bitcoin in case it catches on,
[36:38] in case the central bank idea is
[36:40] actually as bad as other people tell
[36:42] you. Uh so it's it's super interesting
[36:46] where Bitcoin just aligns incentives
[36:49] across the port, across um nations,
[36:52] across like the let's see the the three
[36:55] countries that are now in with a
[36:57] strategic Bitcoin reserve. The first one
[36:59] is El Salvador came I think in 2021.
[37:02] Then Budan uh came officially in 2024
[37:05] even though they are doing it since 2019
[37:08] or so secretly. Uh they they said later
[37:11] uh and now America it's like they those
[37:13] three countries are very different
[37:15] countries like they're on a very
[37:17] different scale but they all have the
[37:19] incentive to be in Bitcoin. Uh and and
[37:22] that's that's a magical thing where
[37:23] everyone has the same incentive to to go
[37:26] onto that platform. Even if you hate it,
[37:28] even if you hate Bitcoin, even if you
[37:30] hate sound money, you really have to
[37:32] adopt it at some point. Exactly. It's
[37:34] massive. And it's also interesting to
[37:36] see, you know, how how far we are at the
[37:38] moment. I mean, I was last Saturday, I
[37:41] was in Vienna um at an event for private
[37:43] investors. Um we had like a small uh a
[37:49] small counter there, right, where we
[37:51] where we uh with other uh exhibitors and
[37:56] I I recall lots of interactions with
[37:59] lots of people um from young to old and
[38:03] they are so there are so different there
[38:05] are so many different people who are who
[38:07] are think thinking about Bitcoin and I
[38:08] made their um 40-minute presentation
[38:11] there at this event um you know like the
[38:13] the room was packed full with with with
[38:15] listeners. So that shows also us that
[38:19] there that that there is a demand. There
[38:21] is an a certain interest towards the
[38:23] topic. People have a lot of questions
[38:25] which I personally think is extremely
[38:26] important to have questions. You have to
[38:28] have you have to have questions and you
[38:30] have to be you have to be skeptical. You
[38:32] should you should you should do your
[38:35] your homework. should uh research that
[38:37] that your questions if if if they arise
[38:40] and you have to you have to be um you
[38:43] know um open-minded and I see there and
[38:45] I also saw there um the the openness
[38:48] from people to discuss Bitcoin um and uh
[38:51] it goes from young to old as I said and
[38:52] this is also very interesting to see
[38:54] that you know like Bitcoin is not like
[38:55] the uh not I think these days are over
[38:58] where Bitcoin is like this you know you
[39:00] cannot touch it it's like a digital kind
[39:02] of thing and it's only like for nerds
[39:04] and like for for teenagers or whatever.
[39:07] We are far beyond that. Bitcoin now
[39:09] actually approaches also older people.
[39:11] And matter of fact, sometimes I I had
[39:14] this interactions with clients where
[39:15] they are um where they thinking
[39:18] themselves, how can I how can I
[39:21] transport my wealth to the next
[39:23] generation? How can I do that? Um
[39:26] certainly it's not a good idea to to
[39:28] pass on cash or to save in cash, of
[39:30] course, but how can I do that? And I
[39:33] think Bitcoin is a major uh a major tool
[39:38] that you can actually play out in order
[39:40] to pass wealth into the next
[39:42] generations. And and this is something
[39:44] that is now also is getting even more um
[39:46] more interesting and interested for for
[39:48] so many people to perceive Bitcoin as as
[39:52] a store of wealth to pass on into the
[39:55] next generation. Yeah, this this
[39:57] generational idea uh generational wealth
[40:00] idea is really big uh in in Bitcoin. I
[40:02] think it's it's also beautiful and maybe
[40:05] just um maybe listeners are already sick
[40:08] of hearing that because I bring it up
[40:10] quite some time in the podcast but I
[40:12] think it's really interesting. Uh I look
[40:14] at my audience statistics on my podcast
[40:18] and I have around 150,000
[40:21] uh people watching in in a one month uh
[40:24] period uh the podcast with like I think
[40:26] half of that is returning viewers. Uh,
[40:29] and so it's it's a pretty big spectrum.
[40:33] Uh, and I see uh over 7% of my audience
[40:37] is above 65 years old. Uh, under my age,
[40:41] I'm 26. Under my age is just
[40:43] 1%. Uh, and the rest is somewhere
[40:45] between. I think the average age is like
[40:47] 45 47 years old. Uh, and for for a
[40:51] podcast that is where the host is so
[40:54] young, uh, it really surprised me. Um,
[40:58] it probably has also to do with the
[41:00] format because I have a onehour long uh
[41:04] relaxed conversation. Maybe that's not
[41:06] something that a 18year-old is very
[41:08] excited about. Uh, I was always excited
[41:11] about podcast even young, but I'm I'm
[41:14] I'm maybe not the average. Uh so uh I I
[41:18] do see actually in Bitcoin more let's
[41:22] say middle-aged uh people in in Bitcoin
[41:24] with like 40 50 years old uh and not the
[41:28] younger ones under 30. Maybe also one
[41:31] reason could be is just like a
[41:32] theoretical idea that they're throwing
[41:34] here on the table. But maybe one thing
[41:36] is that you know you have like a fast
[41:38] living generation. I don't know is it I
[41:41] don't know what the generation is
[41:42] called. Is a generation set. I have no
[41:43] idea. I'm I'm I'm completely out of
[41:45] there. I don't don't follow that that
[41:46] that categorization. But anyhow, I think
[41:49] young people they're used to consume um
[41:52] information very fast. Uh I think maybe
[41:55] it's not easy for them to follow along
[41:57] in a very fastmoving environment. Um you
[42:00] have a lot of distraction, fairly enough
[42:02] to say, right? They have a lot of
[42:03] distraction out there. Uh and I I I
[42:06] think um it comes also with age. when
[42:09] you mature, maybe you're getting a
[42:11] little bit more um re reflective to
[42:15] yourself and to your environment. Maybe
[42:17] maybe you ask yourself what do you want
[42:19] in life? What do you want to accomplish?
[42:21] Um when you're young, you are either way
[42:24] you're working all the time or you're
[42:25] studying, you're very focused, you're
[42:27] nearly in a tunnel. I would say I think
[42:29] maybe this this changes when you're
[42:31] getting older, when you're mature, when
[42:33] you have to be accountable for your
[42:34] environment, for for maybe your family.
[42:37] And I think at least or this could be
[42:40] also like an an spark that that that
[42:43] sets fire uh to ask the questions how to
[42:48] manage for example your your your your
[42:51] wealth or how how do you or or do you
[42:54] know what inflation is and asking like
[42:56] this simple simple-minded questions but
[42:58] I think it's important to to ask
[42:59] yourself that question. Um and um if you
[43:03] take a look and I don't want I don't
[43:06] want to be pessimistic actually I I I am
[43:10] very
[43:10] optimistic person in general I would say
[43:13] but I try to be realistic and if you
[43:15] take a look also in in the numbers
[43:17] Austria for example had now I think it's
[43:19] going to be the third year where we have
[43:21] a deficit like the Austrian state was
[43:23] going to have a deficit is uh the first
[43:26] time after the second world war right so
[43:28] something is not working pretty pretty
[43:31] nicely here and I think in general
[43:33] doesn't even doesn't even concern
[43:35] Austria itself. Um I think um you know
[43:38] like a budget deficits you have you see
[43:41] this across Europe and across across the
[43:44] globe and um what this sparks is of
[43:48] course the inflation and I think as as
[43:51] soon as you are aware of what inflation
[43:54] is and how for example the political
[43:57] framework um engages um I think you you
[44:01] you you can anticipate
[44:04] uh certain certain developments. and
[44:06] right and um saving and I think
[44:10] Austrians in general as I think Germans
[44:12] or even uh Swiss people I I think are
[44:16] very conservative and in general very
[44:18] strict in terms of saving capital for
[44:21] bad times to or for for for your own
[44:25] house or whatsoever. Right? This was the
[44:28] idea and maybe it still is the idea. But
[44:31] when you see all the the the the the
[44:34] toughness within the economic situation
[44:37] that you're facing all across the globe,
[44:39] might be a good idea to add some
[44:41] Bitcoin. Might be a good idea to have um
[44:43] diversification and might be a good idea
[44:45] at least studying Bitcoin and uh and and
[44:47] and build yourself an an opinion um
[44:51] around it. Right? So that would be also
[44:54] a suggestion that that I would speak out
[44:56] loud when when when I would have to uh
[44:59] when I would have to to face that
[45:00] questions maybe from from younger
[45:02] people. It's also under 25 or under 20
[45:05] years old. You usually also don't have
[45:07] the financial problems as you don't have
[45:10] a lot of money usually um or you maybe
[45:13] still live with your parents. Uh you
[45:15] might be be in university and only have
[45:18] like a small side job. uh and if you uh
[45:21] only uh work as much as you consume you
[45:25] you don't have the problem of where to
[45:27] store your money because um when you
[45:29] think about that age ranges of 40 to 50
[45:33] that's where uh you you get more and
[45:35] more money and you're also thinking
[45:36] about okay how can I provide maybe
[45:38] generational wealth maybe how can I uh
[45:41] ensure my retirement and I think that's
[45:43] just the age where the most questions
[45:45] about money come from but to your point
[45:47] it's very important I think from
[45:49] starting from like 11 years old, 12
[45:51] years old to have small it was a super I
[45:54] was at a from my girlfriend a friend's
[45:57] party last Sunday uh and I didn't knew a
[46:00] lot of people there uh so someone
[46:03] brought a a book for uh the kid uh with
[46:08] them as a as a present and it was a book
[46:11] about money and I was blown away like
[46:13] they didn't I did not had anything to do
[46:15] with that it would be my perfect gift
[46:18] for But uh I didn't had anything to do
[46:21] with that. And I looked at that book and
[46:23] the book had like what is money? What's
[46:25] the history of money? And then there was
[46:26] one small thing. It's like what is
[46:28] Bitcoin? Uh and actually directly was
[46:30] like okay where's the capital? Where's
[46:32] the Bitcoin thing? That's
[46:34] Yinda. It was actually quite good. Uh
[46:37] and I and I was surprised how how nice
[46:40] they wrote about Bitcoin. Obviously it
[46:41] was not exactly how I wanted it to be.
[46:44] They had like uh they listed some good
[46:47] things and some bad things and the bad
[46:48] things were like environment and like
[46:51] things like that. Uh but I overall I was
[46:54] like it is in there. They have only
[46:57] bitcoin and not crypto. They actually
[47:00] have uh only bitcoin written what is
[47:02] with bitcoin. They they don't even
[47:04] mention crypto which I think is a super
[47:06] success to have that in the book. Um and
[47:09] they actually uh um explain okay what is
[47:12] proof of work. They explain the mining
[47:14] process. I'm like, what? For a kids
[47:16] book. Uh, and it was not a Bitcoin book
[47:18] like it was a normal money book. Uh, and
[47:21] that was just a random story which made
[47:24] me extremely bullish and like wow like
[47:26] Bitcoin really is deep into uh society
[47:30] and in the finance world already and
[47:32] sometimes I think we we we lose the
[47:35] appreciation of like how far we have
[47:37] already come. Yeah. And that is true and
[47:40] um I I agree to that. I was um few weeks
[47:44] ago I was um at a symposium from uh the
[47:48] Austrian Economic Chamber um and there
[47:52] were have been two speeches right two
[47:54] keynotes and one was from a form manager
[47:57] and um like the title was like financial
[48:01] market trends 2025 right that was the
[48:03] that was the that was the cliffhanger
[48:05] right there and I thought okay you know
[48:08] let's see what what he has to say and
[48:10] you know what what other financial
[48:11] market trends
[48:12] And matter of fact, he mentioned Bitcoin
[48:14] four or five times. He mentioned Bitcoin
[48:18] by its name four or five times. You
[48:20] know, like the the room was full with
[48:21] maybe 500 people, right? also from the
[48:24] financial industry sitting there. But uh
[48:28] it was not mentioned in the way that for
[48:30] example ah you know like you have for
[48:32] example uh you know like uh like gold or
[48:35] the S&P 500 performing this and that or
[48:38] or the bond market is you know uh at the
[48:40] moment and uh at a certain um ROI at it
[48:45] was more like you know dropping Bitcoin
[48:47] in terms of you know mentioning as a
[48:50] payment. So they're like mentioning you
[48:53] know when I would like to make payments
[48:55] for my clients or for my employees I
[48:57] want to pay them in euros or dollars and
[49:00] not not in bitcoin. So he was referring
[49:02] rather in in this in this kind of
[49:04] situation bitcoin but um either way like
[49:07] mentioning bitcoin and and and dropping
[49:10] you know and dropping uh the the term
[49:13] bitcoin uh for 500 people. Uh I think
[49:16] that I thought that very interesting
[49:18] because at least some more people hear
[49:20] about Bitcoin and I think now we are at
[49:22] a stage where a lot of people have heard
[49:24] about Bitcoin also a lot of
[49:26] entrepreneurs and businesses have heard
[49:27] about Bitcoin some have an idea about
[49:30] Bitcoin maybe stronger maybe less strong
[49:33] um maybe some are educated some are not
[49:36] but there is at least um I would say a
[49:39] brand recognition based also on the logo
[49:42] um also the term Bitcoin you know it
[49:44] creates images in your head. So people
[49:46] are we're now actually in a very
[49:48] interesting um pivoting moment I would
[49:50] say where where Bitcoin is out there and
[49:52] it's just like about it's all about
[49:53] embracing Bitcoin from this stage on
[49:55] right and I remember also one quote from
[49:57] Leon Leon Vancou
[50:00] um he was at at Nikico's podcast um I
[50:02] think two months ago and Nick and and
[50:04] and and Leon said something very
[50:07] interesting for me in there he mentioned
[50:10] um the um the way of monetization for
[50:13] Bitcoin and he mentioned that stage
[50:15] Number one, it it always, you know, it
[50:18] always starts with the with the
[50:19] characteristic of a collectible. Station
[50:21] number two is it always follows up with
[50:24] the um with uh a store of of of of
[50:28] value. Station number three is a a tool
[50:30] of transaction and station number four
[50:32] is a calculation unit. and he said and I
[50:35] agree with Leon 100% we're now at the
[50:37] moment at the stage where we are talking
[50:39] about Bitcoin as a store of value of
[50:41] course and is still an extremely
[50:44] interesting period of time to to to be
[50:47] you know in in on in the front line of
[50:50] of the monetization of that asset class
[50:53] and and I think as as more uh businesses
[50:57] recognize that um and this is what I see
[51:01] the more businesses are recognizing hey
[51:03] that's It's a very interesting uh
[51:05] completely new monetary system that
[51:07] actually unfolds in front of me. I can
[51:09] participate I can participate with 1% I
[51:12] can participate with.5%. I can also
[51:15] participate with five 20 30 whatever
[51:17] percent but I can I can set I can you
[51:20] know step my foot in there. I think this
[51:22] is something very inspiring and and and
[51:25] this plays out in full effect and this
[51:26] is also something very interesting to
[51:28] see. Uh that's that's it's super
[51:30] fascinating uh of of of seeing that
[51:33] happening. I I place it in the theory of
[51:36] right now probably since 2020 maybe 2021
[51:41] we are kind of in a normalizing Bitcoin
[51:44] um situation where now there's publicly
[51:47] traded company there's nation states
[51:49] talking about it you hear it from all
[51:51] sorts of live if you are just like for
[51:53] manager you hear it on stage there maybe
[51:56] you have some podcast uh and and and
[51:58] things like that and from every side you
[52:01] hear Bitcoin and it just gets normal
[52:03] normalized pe
[52:05] people even if they don't even have to
[52:08] really uh see that uh wearingly like
[52:12] intentionally they just see it in in the
[52:14] background and that seed gets planted
[52:17] that bitcoin is one normal asset uh and
[52:20] if we just succeed in that and people
[52:22] accept bitcoin as an as an asset that
[52:26] just is there that that's when we have
[52:29] won when there's no more questions like
[52:31] will the government ban it and and and
[52:33] on all on and questioning the quantum
[52:37] computer weird things and like the the
[52:40] uh electricity efficiency. If if those
[52:44] things go away slowly with like Black
[52:46] Rockck with the nation states with with
[52:48] all those normalizing factors from uh
[52:51] top uh down but also from bottom up uh
[52:54] both both factors are in player here. I
[52:57] think that's the the moment where
[52:58] Bitcoin just uh will probably reach that
[53:02] parabolic uh moment where Bitcoin like
[53:04] of course you have to have Bitcoin right
[53:06] I agree and also one interesting aspect
[53:10] I think that is also interesting to
[53:11] mention um if you take a look at the at
[53:15] the allocation you know which kind of
[53:18] group or or or enter this whole Bitcoin
[53:21] you know you know probably the chart you
[53:22] know you know 21 million you know 1.5
[53:26] 1.2 2 is going to uh uh uh be still be
[53:28] mind in the future until 2040 whatever.
[53:31] Um but you see in that in that uh in
[53:34] that graph that nearly 70% of all the
[53:37] bitcoin holders are individuals. You
[53:39] have to you have to think about that.
[53:42] Can you imagine like you have the rarest
[53:44] asset like like a asset that actually
[53:47] like develops or evolved from bottom to
[53:51] top full effect on its way to rise above
[53:54] all the other assets um and to see
[53:57] nearly nearly 70% I think it's 69.7%
[54:02] um are individual holders and if you
[54:05] take a look at 2024 what happened there
[54:07] I mean um I I think you I think 500,000
[54:12] Bitcoin uh have been sold from
[54:15] individuals
[54:17] uh during that year and that and and and
[54:21] and who and who has bought Bitcoin, you
[54:24] know, it was the entities, it was the
[54:26] ETF issuer and it was companies
[54:30] and you see like the uh you see um the
[54:33] pillar actually are shifting the pillar
[54:35] of of um of ownership are changing. Um I
[54:41] think that um that lots of individuals
[54:45] are
[54:47] uh maybe you know they're holding
[54:49] Bitcoin for a long time maybe um um
[54:52] maybe an individual who is maybe new
[54:55] into the space are reacting emotionally
[54:57] different because you know it's it's a
[55:00] new asset. It's it's just to a certain
[55:01] degree a little bit volatile, right? Um
[55:04] and and maybe are irrational in their in
[55:06] their decision-m process. But who are
[55:09] who are buying buying, you know, you
[55:10] have as as I said, you know, you have
[55:12] like the the institutions buying, you
[55:14] see the the F is buying and you see
[55:15] companies buying and that actually um
[55:18] approves what I have been saying what
[55:20] I've been witnessing to see companies
[55:22] buying in Bitcoin big time. Um and um
[55:26] and I think recognizing Bitcoin as a
[55:28] legitimate
[55:30] um asset as a legitimate store of value.
[55:33] Um and when this trend would follow
[55:36] along for for the years to
[55:39] come, meaning that individuals selling,
[55:42] institutions and companies and
[55:44] governments buying. I
[55:47] think if we like it or not, I think it
[55:50] it could be at a certain point where
[55:52] where Bitcoin is um a
[55:56] very like an elite asset if you want to
[56:00] throw out the the the word out. Yeah, it
[56:02] could be seen as that, you know, like um
[56:05] or like having or holding portions of
[56:07] Bitcoin could be very significant in the
[56:09] near future. Um and and I think this is
[56:13] very very um present in in their head of
[56:17] of CEOs and and and and business owners
[56:20] to to read between the lines to analyze
[56:23] also um the uh the the flow of Bitcoin
[56:27] and to say okay um I still I want to
[56:30] participate. I want to to help my my
[56:33] company with a certain degree of Bitcoin
[56:35] ownership and I I buy in. And uh this is
[56:38] an extremely fascinating situation. Um
[56:40] that shows you know again the adoption
[56:43] is is is moving on and unfortunately I
[56:47] think um some individual will will maybe
[56:50] leave the market and maybe will leave
[56:54] the market or leave Bitcoin for good or
[56:56] I don't know it could be it could be an
[56:58] theory. Yeah. Yeah. It's I think that's
[57:01] a natural progression actually. Um
[57:05] because companies in general are better
[57:09] with dealing with money than individuals
[57:11] I think because companies usually have
[57:14] uh people that really try hard to make
[57:17] the company run longer. They have um way
[57:20] more responsibility. They have to uh
[57:23] feed 50 employees, 100 employees,
[57:25] thousands of employees. So obviously
[57:28] they they think way harder about every
[57:31] financial decision they take. They have
[57:33] way more resources and way more research
[57:35] in those things. and individuals uh are
[57:38] maybe more emotionally and like oh
[57:41] Bitcoin is going and that's why I have
[57:43] such a huge respect for all those OGs
[57:46] that bought like 10 years ago and and
[57:48] never sold or like have like still 80 I
[57:51] know that's rare but like still like 80%
[57:54] plus of their stack because not only
[57:56] there are major downturns but I think
[57:58] the the bigger thing is actually the
[58:00] upturns of seeing your um uh stack
[58:04] growing from let's say you have $1,000
[58:06] in then all of the sudden the same stack
[58:08] is now $10,000. Now all of the sudden
[58:11] it's $100,000 now it's a million worth.
[58:14] At some point you're like okay I still
[58:16] have the same job I still have the same
[58:17] income. I cannot really afford anything
[58:20] or I can only afford a little bit but my
[58:22] Bitcoin stack is growing and then like
[58:24] ah okay let's buy that car let's let's
[58:27] the
[58:28] the attractiveness of buying something
[58:31] good with with that stack on an
[58:33] individual level I think is just way
[58:36] higher the the like okay like let's
[58:39] let's let's buy it and as a company
[58:41] maybe you can uh maybe you can compete
[58:45] that a little bit better I don't know
[58:47] Well, I I think so. As I said, you know,
[58:49] like a company's their decision-m
[58:51] process is very grounded. Um, you know,
[58:53] the founders are very eager to pass the
[58:56] company into the next generation. So,
[58:57] they are very straightforward and very
[58:59] precise with their decision-m process.
[59:01] Um, Bitcoin is is for for a lot of
[59:04] companies a part in that uh which is
[59:06] great to see. Um, also the industry are
[59:09] varying. Um I think was also very
[59:12] interesting to mention is that you know
[59:14] if if I take a look at all the clients
[59:16] that I take care of um I see a certain
[59:20] cluster
[59:22] um for real estate and um for that
[59:27] sector but on the other hand all the
[59:31] other industries are so it's so
[59:33] wellrounded with other industries um and
[59:36] you know there are so many businesses
[59:37] and industries blend in uh which
[59:40] This is amazing to see. Uh and um and as
[59:45] you know as as uh um um diverse Bitcoin
[59:49] is uh so are are the companies who are
[59:52] embracing Bitcoin which is also very
[59:54] interesting very interesting to see but
[59:57] uh it's it's I would say a hell of a
[59:59] ride uh at the moment uh to to
[60:01] witnessing um in in in in the front
[60:05] line. Um we're also trying to add value
[60:08] for our companies or for our clients in
[60:10] terms of um webinars for example because
[60:13] we we witness the need of you know more
[60:16] information or more information towards
[60:18] tax questions or storage is also a big
[60:21] thing. I mean we could maybe also talk
[60:23] hours for when it comes to storage your
[60:25] bitcoin and also for example bitcoin
[60:28] back loans right also this aspect. So
[60:30] those are also like three major issues
[60:32] that are companies are very uh companies
[60:35] who own Bitcoin are very eager to uh to
[60:38] experience more information. Um and we
[60:40] are also very eager to distribute
[60:43] webinars with with uh other companies or
[60:46] other um individuals who are covering
[60:49] those um those uh those questions in
[60:52] webinars. So we are continuing uh
[60:54] putting out educational content. Um and
[60:57] also of course um we we try to um we try
[61:01] to interact in into our community as
[61:03] much as we can and yeah and and company
[61:06] owners appreciate extremely that they
[61:09] have somebody to talk to. It's it's
[61:11] extremely necessary. You know, it's also
[61:13] what I have learned over the last 2
[61:15] years is um of course you can offer
[61:18] buying Bitcoin through a platform and
[61:20] you know and the company runs through on
[61:22] boarding process without interacting
[61:24] with a human being. That that could
[61:26] actually be somewhere, right? That could
[61:27] actually be somewhere and that's fine.
[61:29] Maybe maybe the onboarding process is is
[61:31] lasting longer because there are maybe
[61:34] more more questions back or whatsoever.
[61:37] For us, it's very it's very
[61:38] straightforward. There are people
[61:40] working in the company. We have an
[61:42] office right in the the city center of
[61:44] guards. Um they can reach out, clients
[61:47] can reach out to us, they can book video
[61:49] calls. Um they can book workshops for
[61:52] example where where uh where we come
[61:54] into companies and talk about Bitcoin.
[61:56] Um so they learn more. So they have you
[61:58] know a certain um idea of what we are
[62:00] doing and what possibilities they have.
[62:02] Um and and this you know like this um um
[62:07] personal um aspect is extremely
[62:10] important for for a lot of companies
[62:13] because Bitcoin as itself as a digital
[62:16] asset as you know is a digital is is a
[62:20] digital thing and they want to have
[62:22] somebody where they can where they can
[62:24] raise the questions uh and that your
[62:26] that their individual questions um have
[62:28] been answered and also this is something
[62:30] I think that we do extremely well um
[62:32] extremely well. This is definitely I
[62:34] would say like one of the USPs for co of
[62:36] confinity is uh the the support and the
[62:38] the interaction with clients and um
[62:42] maybe also one one key uh one key uh
[62:46] element of our success and uh you know
[62:49] company owners are individuals
[62:53] um as you and I do they have questions
[62:56] um and they highly appreciate if if
[62:59] their questions towards Bitcoin are can
[63:02] be answered in a personal manner. Yeah.
[63:04] Are they um are the businesses openly
[63:07] talking about or disclosing that they
[63:09] they have Bitcoin? Is or they doing
[63:12] press releases or something like that?
[63:13] That's a good point. I mean um I would
[63:16] say like it's it's 50/50. Um I mean I
[63:20] would say 50% are very secretly buying.
[63:24] They don't want to be visible out there
[63:27] which I also of course I I I understand.
[63:30] uh and the other half is uh active in
[63:34] the way of that they uh maybe mentioning
[63:37] us right mentioning our service
[63:39] mentioning that they are satisfied with
[63:41] what we are doing. Um also of course I
[63:44] have companies where they try to
[63:46] integrate this bitcoin spirit in their
[63:48] company. Uh speaking about for example
[63:50] saving plans for employees. So I have
[63:53] also um a few clients, a few companies
[63:56] who are offering their employees saving
[63:59] plans into Bitcoin. And in Austria, for
[64:01] example, you have I think it's
[64:04] €186 annually that you can uh that you
[64:08] can uh uh use um tax relief for for your
[64:13] employees. Um and in Germany, I think
[64:16] it's a little bit the the amount of
[64:17] money is a little bit higher. I think
[64:18] it's 50 years per month in in Germany if
[64:21] I can recall it correctly. Um and with
[64:24] that excessive money right that is more
[64:26] or less um uh um not as can I say it in
[64:32] English it's it's not that um tax uh um
[64:37] um not executed by tax so far so so so
[64:40] lot they can actually use this capital
[64:42] to to follow along with Bitcoin saving
[64:44] plans for employees al something that we
[64:46] are seeing um and uh and great to see
[64:50] that also employees are taking an active
[64:51] role into into the Bitcoin strategy.
[64:54] Matter of fact, for two weeks I was in a
[64:55] company there, there was an employee who
[64:58] initiated the workshop there, right? So
[65:00] there was a employee there. Um he he
[65:04] talked to the CEO. He mentioned the idea
[65:05] of Bitcoin. Um and he he reached out to
[65:08] me and I was there and we you know we
[65:11] were there in a in a very nice small
[65:14] group um with the CEO um and we have
[65:18] been talking about Bitcoin and um and I
[65:20] was very uh lucky and fortunate to
[65:23] answer also the questions of the CEO and
[65:26] funny thing is that also at the end you
[65:28] know they come to the conclusion that
[65:30] hey maybe it's not a bad idea to to to
[65:32] to study Bitcoin even more right and to
[65:36] um and and and to interact into Bitcoin.
[65:38] Um it's all about how to explain things.
[65:40] It's all about to how to interact and um
[65:43] how to tear down barrier at the um in in
[65:45] in this particular stage when when you
[65:47] have um you know like skeptic people or
[65:50] skeptic uh businesses facing Bitcoin.
[65:53] That that's super fun to to see
[65:56] employees saying like hey CEO we we we
[65:58] need Bitcoin like I have a financial
[66:01] idea here. that that's I think that's uh
[66:03] the grassroots movement and I think
[66:05] that's also something that um every
[66:09] bitcoiner can actually do of like if
[66:11] they work in a bitcoin in in a company
[66:13] it's like hey like wh why are we not
[66:15] doing anything with bitcoin or are we
[66:16] doing something with bitcoin or even uh
[66:19] small things like asking a restaurant
[66:21] hey can I pay with bitcoin even if they
[66:23] don't just like dropping that word while
[66:26] paying it that might trigger a process
[66:29] of like the waitress says to to uh to
[66:32] the owner of the business like hey like
[66:33] this week two people ask for bitcoin
[66:35] payments should we do that once uh and
[66:38] maybe if it's not two maybe there's a
[66:40] third person asking at some point the
[66:42] owner is like okay let's look into this
[66:44] so I think there's a lot of grassroots
[66:48] um uh signal that can be can be done
[66:51] that's actually has a major impact uh on
[66:55] on a higher level of the business owner
[66:57] side uh being they adopting as a on the
[67:01] balance sheet or also as a as a medium
[67:04] of exchange for like I don't know for a
[67:05] restaurant or something like that. Uh I
[67:07] think that has a has a major impact. I'm
[67:11] super interested in this conversation
[67:12] with a CEO that they kind of got
[67:15] approached with with those um uh I don't
[67:19] know can you say like what are kind of
[67:21] the questions like is is the usual thing
[67:24] with an individual orange building those
[67:26] questions coming up in that is a similar
[67:28] orange building story or um you mean can
[67:31] can you can you yeah the the CEO when
[67:34] when he when he's in the in the meeting
[67:37] and he's not already orange build he
[67:39] probably has similar questions than
[67:41] someone that just comes into Bitcoin as
[67:42] an individual, right? That's a good
[67:44] thing. Uh it's a good point. Yes. Um it
[67:46] can it can happen that you are in a
[67:49] workshop with with the initiator, with
[67:51] the employee, with the CEO and maybe
[67:53] other other people and you are
[67:56] explaining the origin of Bitcoin. you're
[67:58] explaining the history about money very
[68:00] briefly of course but you know we try to
[68:02] explain Bitcoin and it can happen that
[68:03] the CEO is sitting in his chair like
[68:06] that and and doesn't any questions and
[68:10] doesn't speak and it's just like
[68:11] watching maybe what you're saying for 15
[68:12] minutes can happen when you reach
[68:15] certain slides or certain contents
[68:18] um then this behavior changes
[68:19] immediately
[68:21] um and I can recall one such a meeting
[68:24] which was very inspiring a very very
[68:27] great meeting Um and um I had like one
[68:31] slide that was very um that grabbed
[68:35] actually the attention of the CEO and
[68:36] the slide was actually like showing the
[68:39] development like number go up. Okay.
[68:40] showing like the uh the four year cycle
[68:42] like showing like the uh the the price
[68:44] performance of Bitcoin over the last
[68:46] like 10 years. um you know and and with
[68:50] in the same in the same uh graph you saw
[68:52] the hash rate right you see you you see
[68:55] how how how the hash rate actually is
[68:57] increasing and go parabolic for the last
[69:00] few years and uh for me as as a
[69:04] Bitcoiner and for somebody who is very
[69:07] interesting in Bitcoin as itself
[69:10] um I think that nice parabolic curve
[69:14] more interesting than than the price uh
[69:19] uh projecting line, right? Because you
[69:21] see what is going to happen and this
[69:25] chart for example can grab attention and
[69:28] you and you can you can you can um uh
[69:32] you can refer to that and you can
[69:33] explain what Bitcoin actually is. It's
[69:35] more than a price that is going up and
[69:36] down and in general it goes up and to
[69:38] the right. Okay. But it is more it is
[69:41] about like growing a a monetary network
[69:44] and you can actually like showcase that
[69:46] and you can you know you can you can
[69:48] address that to the CEO and this is for
[69:50] example something that catches
[69:52] attentions and that raises questions and
[69:55] there were have been a lot of questions
[69:56] that have been answered and at that
[69:57] moment um but this is like a funny story
[70:00] so I think it's all about um it's all
[70:02] about
[70:03] um the content is all about the
[70:06] explanation because everybody is
[70:09] interested in different kind of um
[70:11] information um uh kind of information uh
[70:15] um
[70:16] um contents right so I think when you
[70:19] are when you when you when you when when
[70:21] you don't have any any interaction about
[70:23] Bitcoin at all and you have heard maybe
[70:25] Bitcoin once or twice um it sounds very
[70:28] interesting that Bitcoin is actually a
[70:31] protocol and and and monetary network
[70:33] that is growing that is decentralized
[70:36] and you see it in terms of for example
[70:37] the hash rate how this how this network
[70:40] is actually um rising right into the top
[70:43] and therefore it's very interesting and
[70:45] compelling to maybe ask yourself huh
[70:48] that's a very interesting questions as
[70:49] we have said before right um we are now
[70:51] into the stage two where we have like
[70:54] this uh store of value character so
[70:56] we're not into the transaction uh phase
[70:59] yet maybe it's a good idea to to to take
[71:02] a closer look into bitcoin um as an
[71:04] entrepreneur so I think it's different
[71:06] so everybody has has their own um has
[71:09] their own approach and you have to
[71:11] address uh and you have to address this
[71:14] idea differently of course because every
[71:15] person is different, every person has
[71:17] different questions. Um so you have to
[71:19] interact um differently but the good
[71:22] thing is you know Bitcoin is Bitcoin it
[71:26] has simple rules. It is super actually
[71:28] like if you have a if if you if you take
[71:31] um you know like a um a super uh um high
[71:35] level perspective bitcoin is rather
[71:38] simple um and if you if you um transport
[71:42] this idea and if you transporting uh
[71:44] this this kind of mechanism into to an
[71:47] individual doesn't matter if it's an
[71:48] individual person private investor or an
[71:51] entrepreneur company owner u that's
[71:53] something um that is very interesting
[71:55] for them to that they catch attention
[71:57] to. Absolutely. It's it's super fun uh
[72:00] that like number technology but also
[72:03] hash rate crop technology. I I like the
[72:05] hash rate chart also way more. I think
[72:07] it shows how fast actually Bitcoin is is
[72:09] is growing and I think it's actually a
[72:11] leading character leading metric for for
[72:14] Bitcoin's growth in the future. Um I
[72:17] have one question to ask each and every
[72:18] one of my guests and the question is
[72:20] what can we learn from you besides
[72:21] Bitcoin? Um besides Bitcoin, I think
[72:25] um you can learn from me that you know
[72:30] follow always what you would like to do.
[72:32] Uh I always followed what I was
[72:34] interested in personally uh also in a
[72:36] professional manner. Um so this is
[72:39] something that I would hammer out there.
[72:41] So always follow what what you're
[72:42] interested in and ideally um transform
[72:46] this into your job. Um second thing but
[72:49] this is Bitcoin related a little bit
[72:51] Bitcoin related um study Bitcoin and and
[72:55] and take what I said um and and reflect
[72:59] what I have said reflect the fact that
[73:02] companies are buying in reflect the fact
[73:04] that companies are uh secretly and
[73:07] silently buying um but this is happening
[73:12] um and if you are if you're private hold
[73:15] of Bitcoin appreciate it um know what
[73:18] you hold and if you are a company u
[73:20] watching watching this episode um and
[73:23] you maybe are not into Bitcoin or maybe
[73:24] you are into Bitcoin um maybe you have
[73:27] also like draw some conclusions out of
[73:28] it and and if you hold Bitcoin
[73:30] congratulations um if not think about it
[73:33] um and yeah and if you have any
[73:35] questions also people feel free to reach
[73:37] out to me on LinkedIn um follow me on
[73:39] LinkedIn um and yeah and if you have any
[73:42] questions you can also follow up really
[73:43] cool um we have an end routine in the
[73:45] podcast uh where the previous guest is
[73:48] asking a question for the next guest
[73:49] without knowing who the next guest
[73:50] actually is. Uh and the question for
[73:53] from previous guest to you is what do
[73:55] you think will be the next wave of
[73:57] adoption for plebs? So not businesses
[73:59] but uh individuals uh outside of price
[74:03] action
[74:04] the next adoption wave like what is
[74:07] triggering the next adoption wave was I
[74:09] think kind of the answer kind of the
[74:11] question. Um I think um like new new
[74:16] plebs coming in maybe the need to to
[74:19] think about Bitcoin based on on the
[74:22] continuing of inflation um based on the
[74:27] decentralized character of Bitcoin to to
[74:29] study Bitcoin even more. So I think um
[74:32] external factors will drive the the
[74:35] adoption. External factors meaning any
[74:37] factor that you cannot control by
[74:39] yourself even if it's geopolitical or
[74:41] even if it's fiscal politics. Yeah. The
[74:43] the pain of an inflationary system that
[74:46] you use will drive you and deflationary.
[74:48] Exactly. Really cool. Thank you so much
[74:51] um Ryan for for being on. Um I usually
[74:54] ask always where people can find you but
[74:56] you already uh um said it. I think
[74:59] LinkedIn is is a great place. Yes,
[75:01] exactly. I'm actually entirely on
[75:03] LinkedIn, so people won't find me on
[75:05] Twitter or something like RX. Uh I I I
[75:08] post uh on on LinkedIn. Um yeah, I'm
[75:11] very busy, so I try to to keep up with
[75:13] with my content, but Cofiniti, you have
[75:15] there a lot of very interesting and
[75:17] regular news about Bitcoin and what
[75:19] we're doing. Super. I think there are uh
[75:23] I have now I think like what is it 431
[75:27] guests you're my 40 431 guest. I think
[75:30] you're one of the five people maybe that
[75:33] doesn't have Twitter. It's super fun to
[75:36] to see. But yeah, I will put the
[75:38] LinkedIn uh link in in the description
[75:40] as I always do. Um thank you so much for
[75:42] for being on. Also, thank you so much
[75:43] for everyone that is watching and
[75:45] listening for joining us today. As
[75:46] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[75:48] another episode. Bye-bye.
