[00:00] Bitcoin is something that will really
[00:02] change the way you live your life it
[00:03] changes the way you think about the
[00:05] world changes the way you think about
[00:06] how you interact with people and Society
[00:09] this thing seems to just not go away and
[00:11] just keeps on growing and just keeps on
[00:13] making more waves of adoption like all
[00:16] of the sudden we have companies
[00:18] countries and everyone in in there
[00:20] Bitcoin is the foundation for this
[00:22] Golden Age of Reason there's going to be
[00:23] no point to try and own four houses so
[00:27] that you can have three of them be
[00:28] airbnbs in the in that Bitcoin future
[00:31] that's going to change architecture I
[00:33] think we're going to stop building these
[00:35] temporary structures we're just going to
[00:37] expand and start thinking about
[00:39] possibilities and new ways because we
[00:41] would be able to build incredible things
[00:43] if it wasn't based on Fiat Bitcoin is a
[00:46] system that allows you to preserve that
[00:47] energy so then it removes the threat of
[00:50] having someone steal your time from you
[00:52] if I'm not worried about my time being
[00:54] stolen then I don't need to steal yours
[00:58] [Music]
[01:00] you have a great book at least the title
[01:03] was was really interesting for me when I
[01:04] saw it uh the da of Bitcoin the first
[01:07] thing that I thought of it's because Dow
[01:10] in the cryptoverse stands for
[01:12] decentralized or decentralized automized
[01:15] organization that's was like oh is this
[01:18] is this some shitcoin thing but it's
[01:21] something completely different uh and
[01:24] DSM is something that that then I
[01:26] Googled but before we get into Bitcoin
[01:28] side of things maybe let's explain a
[01:30] little bit um what DSM is and what what
[01:34] you what did you inspire that you wrote
[01:37] the book yeah for sure I you know and
[01:39] and I uh so there there's two ways of
[01:42] Translating that word from Chinese into
[01:44] English and you see it sometimes with a
[01:46] t to and sometimes with a d da and uh in
[01:50] terms of How It's where the language is
[01:54] going with standard Chinese it makes
[01:55] more sense and I think it's more
[01:57] appropriate to to say it and spell it
[01:59] with with a d and so I I've had lots of
[02:01] questions about Dao because of this
[02:04] crypto term and uh obviously like along
[02:08] the way planning the book I had lots of
[02:09] opportunities to make a decision about
[02:11] which one I was going to use and I I
[02:13] felt like it's the more more true to the
[02:16] to the language so in spite of the uh
[02:18] the
[02:19] conflict uh that was kind of why I
[02:21] decided to go that way um dosm is a is a
[02:25] sort of philosophical and religious
[02:26] tradition that emerged out of China
[02:29] around Century BC and uh has to do with
[02:33] a belief and study in an underlying and
[02:36] fundamental principle that uh creates
[02:39] and connects all things in in the
[02:41] universe and that thing is the Dao and
[02:44] so it's a it's a study of this uh this
[02:49] force and um the practice of trying to
[02:52] live your life in alignment with this
[02:55] force and uh so I I have been studying
[02:58] Chinese uh culture in history and I
[03:00] lived in China for a while so my whole
[03:03] life has been uh following this subject
[03:05] and when I got into Bitcoin uh very
[03:08] early on I started just thinking about
[03:10] these similarities and alignments
[03:12] between the subjects and had been
[03:14] thinking about writing a book like this
[03:16] for a long time I was really surprised
[03:18] nobody had written one already because
[03:20] uh adism is a is you know it's not the
[03:23] hugest um tradition in the world but
[03:26] it's pretty big you know there's a lot
[03:27] of bitcoiners and uh it's not that I'm
[03:30] the first person to write something on
[03:31] this subject there's some writings on it
[03:34] butth yeah it was the first book of its
[03:36] kind and uh they're they're two just
[03:38] fascinating subjects I think Bitcoin is
[03:40] something that will really change the
[03:43] way you live your life it changes the
[03:45] way you think about the world changes
[03:47] the way you think about how you interact
[03:48] with with people and and society and uh
[03:52] and this is also true of dosm and this
[03:54] is sort of the the foundation of why I
[03:57] think there's at least sort of an
[03:58] interesting comparison to be made made
[04:00] because they they both um you know dosm
[04:04] was created in a in a very difficult or
[04:06] birth the ideas were birthed at a very
[04:09] difficult time in Chinese history and uh
[04:12] with the hope of reimagining a new way
[04:15] of governing society and helping people
[04:17] organize themselves in a more harmonious
[04:21] way and uh and you could say the same
[04:23] thing about Bitcoin you know I think
[04:25] this is very true that Bitcoin was
[04:28] birthed out of a very tumultuous
[04:30] Financial time that uh has since gotten
[04:34] a little bit more bumpy and uh with the
[04:38] hopes of a brighter future you know
[04:39] Satoshi really
[04:41] wanted to be able to pass something
[04:43] forward to humanity that could really uh
[04:46] reimagine how we think about connecting
[04:48] and organizing ourselves and so that's
[04:50] sort of the basis for the the
[04:53] comparison I love it and and uh and
[04:57] there's a lot of uh books and a lot of
[04:59] of um writings around General like
[05:03] religion uh around philosophies around
[05:08] um thinking Styles I would call it right
[05:11] now uh compared to bitcoin and how we we
[05:14] think of that like there's uh uh you
[05:16] wrote also book like Bitcoin for
[05:18] financial advisors there are like books
[05:20] for conservatives there are book for for
[05:22] all types of of people connecting it
[05:25] with Bitcoin I think this is like the
[05:27] main learning for me for all the podcast
[05:29] interview is that you you can connect
[05:31] Bitcoin with almost everything uh and
[05:34] it's it's really interesting for me to
[05:36] connect it with thaism um what are like
[05:39] for people that have almost no clue uh
[05:42] like me myself about theism what are the
[05:46] core like principles or teachings uh
[05:49] that come in there that connect with
[05:52] Bitcoin yeah and and I think maybe just
[05:54] to add on to your point a little bit
[05:56] there you know it makes sense to me that
[05:58] people have connect already you know
[06:00] Bitcoin in the Bible and and uh Bitcoin
[06:03] and and Hindu tradition what whatever
[06:05] the I think it's because Bitcoin has
[06:08] these aspects of that that that tie into
[06:11] and relate to treating people better uh
[06:14] you know showing up in the world more
[06:16] authentically and um and it's it's
[06:20] eliminating all of these problems that
[06:22] are Downstream of the result of of other
[06:26] people being in charge of manipulating
[06:28] money you know and this this is
[06:29] something that also very true of of that
[06:32] period in ancient his in in Ancient
[06:34] Chinese history that birth dosm was uh
[06:37] you know failed experiments in paper
[06:39] money where people at the top
[06:42] eventually you know steal everyone
[06:44] else's money through the problem of
[06:46] inflation and uh and and it creates
[06:49] turmoil and uncertainty and what what
[06:51] Society I think really needs our our
[06:54] rules and this is part of what religion
[06:56] does is help provide people with
[06:58] guidelines so that they know how to like
[07:01] arrange themselves in in a sort of a
[07:03] peaceful and uh successful
[07:07] civilization and uh yeah so so the key
[07:10] tenants of Daoism there's sort of three
[07:12] that I really highlight in the book and
[07:15] uh the first one is a principle of
[07:17] non-action which is called wooe and uh
[07:21] non-action in dosm is this idea that uh
[07:24] you really want to try to exert the the
[07:27] appropriate amount of force for any
[07:29] action that you're taking in life to
[07:31] make something happen and all the time
[07:34] in life we get out of alignment with
[07:37] what the correct amount of of force is
[07:39] so it's easy to sort of push too hard or
[07:42] push not quite hard enough and you
[07:44] always know if you think about your own
[07:46] life when you've done one or the other
[07:48] we're doing this stuff all the time
[07:49] right and in the book I talk a little
[07:51] bit about my my history is doing sales
[07:53] I've been in financial services sales
[07:55] forever and when you when you try to
[07:57] sell something too hard you know you
[07:59] want it too bad that's when you push
[08:01] somebody away you're trying to close the
[08:03] sale too much and uh equally you know it
[08:07] if you haven't tried hard enough you
[08:09] haven't made enough effort you haven't
[08:10] expressed enough interest then that's
[08:12] where you can sort of see things sort of
[08:14] drift away so the principle of
[08:17] non-action is sort of like this idea of
[08:19] there's a natural current of of things
[08:22] that are flowing around you and all
[08:23] you're trying to do is align yourself
[08:26] with that current and find yourself
[08:28] moving with the dire of everything and
[08:30] even this idea I think is something that
[08:33] you know Bitcoin is a current right this
[08:35] is something that is it is it's a
[08:37] direction and and people who try to swim
[08:40] the opposite way that could be with like
[08:42] you know crypto stuff or uh you know
[08:46] shorting Bitcoin they're they're not
[08:47] going to participate Bitcoin is a
[08:49] current it's happening whether you want
[08:50] to participate in it or not and I you
[08:54] know the the easiest way to to be
[08:56] successful in these things is just to
[08:58] you know align yourself with it and and
[09:00] uh you
[09:02] know come along for the
[09:04] ride um the second one that I talk a lot
[09:08] about in the book is this concept of
[09:10] Duality which is uh captured by the
[09:13] symbol of dosm that everyone is familiar
[09:15] with which is the yin-yang and the this
[09:18] concept represents sort of the
[09:20] independence of opposites in the natural
[09:22] world is sort of dynamic balance of
[09:26] everything having sort of two sides and
[09:29] in dosm it's a really important part of
[09:32] the study to understand that uh you know
[09:35] if you think about a a 24-hour cycle
[09:38] turning from day into night it it's a
[09:41] gradual transformation and it's the same
[09:43] day so day and night are not separate
[09:46] things it's a it's a constant flow where
[09:48] one is always transforming into the
[09:50] other and then back again and the cycle
[09:53] sort of starts a
[09:55] new
[09:56] and in the study of The Duality of the
[10:00] yin and yang you learn a lot by
[10:02] reflecting on something's opposite so so
[10:06] you learn about things by understanding
[10:08] what they're not and uh this is an
[10:11] important way for for uh you know sort
[10:13] of gaining insight and perspective
[10:15] because it you know it's almost
[10:18] impossible to really understand uh
[10:21] something if you don't understand its
[10:23] opposite and uh so so this is a um a
[10:27] really important part of of the way DS
[10:29] sort of think about and imagine the
[10:31] world and the third thing that I the
[10:33] third sort of key point that I talk a
[10:35] lot about in the book is a concept of um
[10:38] the particular and the whole and so
[10:40] another piece owsm is said when I
[10:43] mentioned this at the start is that uh
[10:46] the Dao is um this sort of universal
[10:50] force of creation and it's also a thing
[10:53] that people think about and study and so
[10:56] it it's simultaneously both this thing
[10:59] this subject that exists uh this this
[11:02] Force and and it's also a something that
[11:05] people direct their attention to and
[11:07] think about and change their life as a
[11:09] result of having thought about so it's
[11:11] sort of both of those things it's it's
[11:13] like the subject and the object and um
[11:18] and this is also true of Bitcoin right
[11:20] because Bitcoin is a monetary system
[11:21] it's a technology and we love to you
[11:24] know use it and interact with it and own
[11:26] it but then it's also something that we
[11:28] study and as as a result of studying it
[11:31] it changes the way we think about the
[11:32] world and it changes how we really think
[11:35] about everything and and so it it's both
[11:37] you know it's it's simultaneously both
[11:39] these things it's something that does a
[11:42] very specific function and it's also
[11:44] something that has taken on a life of
[11:46] its own and sort of become this like you
[11:48] know Bitcoin is like a philosophy or a
[11:51] it's sort of an intellectual Tradition
[11:53] now even though it's very young on in
[11:55] its own and who knows maybe in a
[11:56] thousand years what people will be
[11:58] thinking about Bitcoin early bitcoiners
[12:01] today you know this could very well turn
[12:03] into some kind of ancient tradition
[12:05] given enough time I
[12:07] think that's that's fascinating think of
[12:10] like what what Bitcoin can go in and and
[12:13] I have so many thoughts about around
[12:14] that because when you look at uh
[12:16] bitcoiners right now how they celebrate
[12:19] the technology how we talk about the
[12:21] technology how we embrace the technology
[12:25] uh it's almost like it's it's almost
[12:27] like an a way of life a philos y like
[12:29] something way bigger and deeper than
[12:32] just money uh and but when we look at
[12:36] the history at some point email
[12:38] technology was really exciting I don't
[12:41] know if it ever got to the point where
[12:43] it was that exciting as uh Bitcoin but
[12:46] it also did not had an underlying
[12:48] asset uh which you could benefit
[12:51] financially from so um uh now people
[12:54] actually can make uh um something inside
[12:58] of of of Bitcoin and be in in the
[13:01] ecosystem uh and and and have and and
[13:05] gain from that financially but also as
[13:08] as a person in general I feel like um
[13:12] but I feel like it would be really
[13:14] boring to talk about email and and and
[13:17] those stuffs right now and maybe Bitcoin
[13:20] will also be just there at some point
[13:23] maybe Bitcoin will be also like in in 20
[13:25] years everybody everyone will use it but
[13:28] uh will not be a Bitcoin podcast because
[13:31] it will be a really boring topic it will
[13:33] be just be there uh it's interesting for
[13:36] me to think of like maybe Bitcoin leads
[13:38] into like a way of life or there's like
[13:40] an a Bitcoin philosophy coming out and
[13:44] Satoshi things like it could melt in
[13:47] something really big or it could be
[13:49] really boring uh either way Bitcoin will
[13:53] succeed but but but it's interesting for
[13:55] me to to to think of that and you you
[13:58] you think that it could be more than
[14:01] than just the technology and the money
[14:03] that we have it uh right now yeah I mean
[14:07] I it absolutely is because you know I
[14:09] think the the the key difference for me
[14:12] is that almost nobody in the world can
[14:14] exist by ignoring money so there is no
[14:17] way to to be in the world and and not
[14:21] participate in a monetary system and
[14:23] money even today forget about Bitcoin
[14:25] money is so much more than uh a tool a
[14:29] use to exchange value it's a language of
[14:31] value so money is a way that we think
[14:34] about and arrange our ideas about
[14:36] reality right money is a system that we
[14:38] use all of us all the time to you know
[14:41] think about our goals and priorities and
[14:44] how we're you know Gathering the the
[14:47] value of the time that we're spending to
[14:48] earn this money to transform it into
[14:51] other things that we want and so we're
[14:53] we're
[14:54] constantly you know money is just like a
[14:57] a programming language that each of bus
[14:59] has is relative to the place in the
[15:01] world that we grew up in I think is like
[15:03] the most the weirdest thing about money
[15:05] that's happening right now is that there
[15:07] are like 167 different currencies in the
[15:11] world now and so of course we have all
[15:14] these different languages being used of
[15:17] how people value everything and uh so so
[15:22] a bigger thing that I think is going on
[15:23] and you know this might take 20 years it
[15:25] might take 100 years but every currency
[15:28] that fails goes away as there's some
[15:30] sort of consolidation and maybe that
[15:32] eventually I believe will end up with
[15:34] just one system of money where you're
[15:36] talking about and uh at that point now
[15:39] we have eliminated all these different
[15:42] regional and local systems of value
[15:45] these languages of assessing the world
[15:48] and replaced it instead with one and so
[15:52] um this is also another uh sort of key
[15:55] idea that comes back to JSM is you know
[15:58] in Endo ism is it's one Central Force
[16:01] there's one sort of universal law and
[16:04] power that is responsible for everything
[16:07] and this is where I believe Bitcoin is
[16:09] going with money it is the one universal
[16:12] money for all people and uh that itself
[16:16] becomes the foundation for a
[16:19] single uh sort of species level way of
[16:22] thinking about everything and uh it
[16:25] could then
[16:27] be the foundation for for people to
[16:29] think about things at like a species
[16:31] level for us to start to have goals that
[16:35] extend beyond our local borders and
[16:40] um because Bitcoin also simultaneously
[16:43] eliminates the possibility of stealing
[16:45] other people's stuff and uh so Bitcoin
[16:48] is this incredibly peaceful technology
[16:51] right I you I think that um this is
[16:54] another reason why I was really quite
[16:55] motivated to write the book is that a
[16:59] core principle of
[17:01] dosm is that uh you know dosm is is a
[17:06] antiv violent philosophy and uh Bitcoin
[17:10] to me is the most peaceful technology
[17:12] that has ever been invented so there's
[17:14] there's been also discussions about you
[17:16] know maybe bitcoin's future role in
[17:19] geopolitics and and the
[17:22] international uh military strategy or
[17:25] how however you want to phrase it and I
[17:27] and I think that in in fact what what it
[17:31] will do is a hard money that's available
[17:34] to the entire world will will make the
[17:36] the the cost of a aircraft carrier or
[17:40] you know these things will become so
[17:41] expensive when you can't print money out
[17:44] of thin air to pay for them that it's
[17:47] going to actually change the entire way
[17:49] we think about uh power projection
[17:52] between countries because if a country
[17:55] has to bankrupt itself just to pay for
[17:58] these incred incredibly expensive
[17:59] military devices you know it's going to
[18:02] change the economics of warfare so uh I
[18:05] think that it's it has the it it does
[18:08] have a universal power to really sort of
[18:11] unify and pacify uh you know if we're to
[18:16] be successful in becoming the sort of
[18:18] the world's one and single
[18:20] money is is that the the core message of
[18:23] of the
[18:24] book um you know I I think the message
[18:27] is uh if if I had to pull it down to one
[18:30] really sort of central idea it's more
[18:33] about uh well maybe two things one is
[18:36] that you know I believe that Bitcoin
[18:38] works because of this underlying
[18:40] fundamental
[18:42] principle because I do believe that
[18:44] there is a a universal energy that
[18:47] connects all things and creates all
[18:49] things I believe this to be true and so
[18:53] it would then follow logically that
[18:55] Bitcoin also would have emerged from
[18:58] this Universal force and uh it makes
[19:02] sense to me in studying the Dow that we
[19:05] would at some point create or have being
[19:09] being gifted a technology to allow us to
[19:12] interact in a way that is in alignment
[19:15] with this stream with the energy that I
[19:17] was talking about earlier and so this
[19:21] problem of money is it's bigger than the
[19:24] fact that money doesn't really work
[19:26] properly like the the problem of money
[19:28] money creates all these other problems
[19:31] it it makes it puts us all in in sort of
[19:34] a a fend for
[19:36] yourself uh you know it's every person
[19:38] for themsel in the in the broken money
[19:40] world where no one can really
[19:42] effectively store their value and time
[19:43] into the distant future every person has
[19:46] to continuously do what's best for
[19:49] themselves to look out for their own
[19:52] future and if you you know zoom out to a
[19:55] macro level that just makes it
[19:57] incredibly difficult for people to exist
[19:59] harmoniously with each other and go out
[20:02] and or arrange themselves in a
[20:04] civilization that is really civilized
[20:07] and uh so so that's sort of the first
[20:09] idea and the second part I think
[20:11] is trying to imagine what what could
[20:14] then happen if you were able to replace
[20:17] all of those problems that result from
[20:19] Bad money with a with a good money a
[20:22] fair money adjust money and then what
[20:24] would that do to the world what would
[20:26] happen as a result of everyone re uh
[20:29] reimagining their own way of being a
[20:32] person if they didn't have this problem
[20:34] of money and I I think it's much much
[20:37] bigger than people simply being able to
[20:39] you know save money effectively or CH
[20:42] change their spending habits to me
[20:44] Bitcoin is a um it's an agreement on a
[20:48] way of making sense of the world in a
[20:51] way that makes sense and so if you have
[20:53] made sense of one thing in the world
[20:56] rationally it's it's like once you do
[20:59] something once then it becomes easier to
[21:01] do it a second time a third time a third
[21:03] time and so on and so if you start
[21:06] thinking about things in a in a rational
[21:08] way if you start having an expectation
[21:10] of rules that make sense and and then
[21:12] everyone together is all looking at the
[21:15] same problem and saying well like we
[21:18] have this thing over here that we have
[21:19] money and and that with money now the
[21:21] rules of money make sense then we have
[21:23] this thing over here and this thing has
[21:25] no rules or the rules that we have well
[21:27] these rules don't make any sense so we
[21:29] get to we need to get get rid of those
[21:30] or fix those so I think that Bitcoin can
[21:33] become a paradigm for us to think at a
[21:36] species level uh about a system where
[21:40] the expectation of everyone is that
[21:43] rules we should have should make sense
[21:46] they should be transparent they should
[21:47] be something that we all agree on so if
[21:50] we were to if we were to start doing
[21:52] that with everything that's when the
[21:54] world could look really different
[21:55] because I also think the reverse is true
[21:58] today where you have a society where
[22:01] nothing makes sense or there's no
[22:02] expectation for things to make sense
[22:05] then of course the output is going to be
[22:07] like a senseless world like you know we
[22:09] we have no way to audit you know
[22:11] political decisions or money decisions
[22:14] so people don't even care they don't
[22:15] even try you know like they just go
[22:17] about their business and uh you know
[22:19] this is that idea I was saying earlier
[22:21] about how everyone is really just forced
[22:23] to show up into the world and do the
[22:25] best they can and and take care of
[22:26] themselves and it's really like you know
[22:29] this is a journey of of survival whereas
[22:33] uh if all of a sudden you know people
[22:35] were to start thinking about a a
[22:38] baseline expectation of re of
[22:40] rationality like that then I think that
[22:42] what comes after that when a critical
[22:45] threshold or number of people feel this
[22:47] way what you're going to have is like a
[22:49] Renaissance it's going to be the like
[22:52] the uh the the spark for a Golden Age of
[22:55] Reason a a new uh era of civilization
[22:59] where we we just have started thinking
[23:02] about things in a completely different
[23:03] way and this is this is very true of of
[23:06] different sort of Ages of Enlightenment
[23:08] if you think about the history of Europe
[23:10] where something happened a technology or
[23:13] an innovation or an an event and it
[23:16] caused people to start thinking about
[23:18] things in a totally different way and
[23:20] this is what I really think is going on
[23:22] with Bitcoin right now and this is what
[23:24] I think is what what we're watching
[23:26] unfold and it's it's an idea that's
[23:29] diffusing Bitcoin is an incredibly viral
[23:32] idea once people really get it most
[23:34] people who really understand it start to
[23:36] get really obsessed about it and they
[23:37] change the way they live and they start
[23:39] writing books whatever they sort of
[23:41] podcast doing all this different stuff
[23:43] right and that process can keep
[23:45] unfolding until until everybody
[23:47] understands the idea and maybe then at
[23:50] that point we won't be doing Bitcoin
[23:51] podcasts anymore we'll just be doing
[23:53] podcasts about civilization and how cool
[23:55] things have become because everyone now
[23:57] has changed and reframe their way of
[24:00] thinking about how they imagine reality
[24:03] I very much hope that that that's the
[24:05] case and I see it when when you look
[24:08] with when you talk with bitcoiners and
[24:11] we talk a lot of bitcoiners they have
[24:13] this Bitcoin moment almost all of them
[24:15] there are some that have already opened
[24:17] the eyes to central banks uh and to
[24:22] printing money to the to the world and
[24:24] and other things that are going wrong
[24:26] maybe with the world um but most of them
[24:29] got their eyes open with Bitcoin and
[24:31] then they questions other things as you
[24:34] as you described they like oh they the
[24:38] and I I talked uh I think a few podcasts
[24:40] ago with with someone uh who said um why
[24:45] uh people are who are into
[24:48] non-mainstream things uh like in into
[24:52] nonmainstream religion nonmainstream
[24:54] whatever uh usually a little bit more
[24:56] open to to the idea of bitco because
[24:58] they already accept before that there is
[25:01] something that the mainstream doesn't
[25:02] accept and they believe to that to be
[25:05] true and when you look into mainstream
[25:07] when you look into uh normal land just
[25:10] go out on the streets on a busy street
[25:12] ask like 10 people their opinion on
[25:14] bitcoin and you know you get a sense for
[25:16] like what what's the mainstream uh
[25:19] opinion on on on bitcoin right now uh
[25:22] but when you go to to someone who say
[25:25] like oh this and this and that they have
[25:28] they open to the idea that something is
[25:31] cannot be something is different than
[25:35] the mainstream believes it they are at
[25:38] least open to the idea they still don't
[25:40] get it all because then we would be more
[25:43] far ahead in the adoption but at least
[25:45] it could be uh they are more open to
[25:48] that and I think this is also a reason
[25:49] why we have so many people from those uh
[25:54] religions from those non-mainstream
[25:56] things into into to bitcoin uh and this
[25:59] is a really cool thing did did in your
[26:02] life uh Bitcoin open some some eyes or
[26:06] was it were you already primed for for
[26:10] Bitcoin yeah I uh it definitely did you
[26:14] know I and I think like not not
[26:16] everybody is really interested in
[26:18] becoming an expert in Central Banking
[26:20] and currency debasement and all of these
[26:23] things and uh you know I I kind of
[26:25] happened to be so I when I started
[26:27] studying
[26:28] uh when I started studying Bitcoin it
[26:30] made sense for me fairly quickly um but
[26:33] yeah just as a side point about the book
[26:35] like part of the reason why I think
[26:37] these more tangental subjects around
[26:40] Bitcoin are are interesting for the for
[26:42] the community is because there are a lot
[26:45] of people who might be becoming Bitcoin
[26:47] curious right now who don't necessarily
[26:50] want to read the more like hardcore
[26:52] academic books so they're not as
[26:54] interested in the technical aspects of
[26:56] why it works and I also just just think
[26:58] it's very true that Bitcoin Bitcoin to
[27:01] me you maybe not everybody needs to know
[27:03] all that stuff and some people just want
[27:05] to know more about why it works and
[27:08] there there are these like fundamental
[27:09] underlying principles the energetics of
[27:12] what of of why something is possible and
[27:16] this is partly why I think you know the
[27:18] religious aspect can can come into it
[27:21] and um and offer maybe new people a
[27:24] doorway into making sense of the ideas
[27:27] or a comfortable
[27:28] uh entrance into maybe then studying
[27:31] some of the more hardcore stuff uh for
[27:34] me yeah I I have spent most of my career
[27:36] in uh traditional Financial Services
[27:38] doing different uh yeah Mo mostly lots
[27:42] of work with pension plans and uh so I
[27:45] started studying Bitcoin in 2020 and it
[27:48] had to do with um I'm in Canada and uh
[27:52] when when the when lockdowns happened in
[27:55] the spring of 2020 the Canadian
[27:56] government start started in a crazy
[27:59] amount of money paying people to close
[28:01] their businesses paying their employees
[28:03] to stay home paying their rent for them
[28:06] and and I just really didn't understand
[28:08] you know it that was really my light
[28:10] bulb moment I I realized that like you
[28:13] know I it felt like something was wrong
[28:15] for a while but I never really had
[28:17] enough time to uh sit down and really
[28:19] pay attention to it I wasn't really
[28:21] looking even to study Bitcoin I was just
[28:23] trying to understand what the effect of
[28:26] all the money printing might be on the
[28:28] bond market because of uh the pensions
[28:30] that I was working with uh my customers
[28:34] and I read a Bitcoin book by accident my
[28:36] my first Bitcoin book was the price of
[28:38] Tomorrow by Jeff Booth and that one
[28:40] really um shocked me and completely
[28:42] changed my my thoughts about everything
[28:44] I end up reading every you know over the
[28:47] course of 2020 I sort of read every
[28:49] single Bitcoin book I could find and uh
[28:52] you know it's like you remember those uh
[28:56] maybe 15 or 20 years ago it was really
[28:58] popular art piece to have like this
[29:00] pattern and you would have to unfocus
[29:02] your eyes and if you could blur your
[29:04] eyes and then focus them again you would
[29:06] see like a three-dimensional pattern
[29:08] come out of it and once once you saw it
[29:11] it was like impossible to not see it but
[29:13] it could be really difficult for some
[29:15] people to get to the point where they
[29:16] could see it first and that that was
[29:18] totally what happened to me and then you
[29:20] know all of a sudden you're that person
[29:21] that like uncontrollably talking to
[29:24] everybody about Bitcoin and
[29:27] uh not everybody's there right like
[29:29] because to your point I I it's such a
[29:31] funny thing how the average person on
[29:32] the street and this still happens to me
[29:34] all the time I was on a I was on a
[29:36] flight a couple days ago uh somebody it
[29:40] had come up and and the and this
[29:43] person just really thought that Bitcoin
[29:45] was like a you know it's like a very
[29:48] Niche and uh you know kind of out there
[29:51] thing that oh I didn't even realize
[29:53] Bitcoin was still still existed like
[29:55] it's not not in my you know field
[29:57] division at all all so uh yeah it's it's
[30:01] a fascinating thing to watch this uh
[30:03] idea germinate in the human
[30:06] consciousness yeah and I think this
[30:08] those foure Cycles are also really
[30:09] interesting because most people get to
[30:12] know about Bitcoin when it gets to this
[30:15] crazy high or when it crashes down again
[30:18] uh and the time uh time is usually all
[30:21] four years as as was the the last few
[30:24] decades or the last few decade plus five
[30:27] years um and I think then the idea of
[30:30] Bitcoin comes up again and they're like
[30:32] oh it's it's up uh I was seeing at 2000
[30:36] now it's a 20,000 oh no but it now it
[30:38] crashed down to 10,000 oh I'm right so I
[30:41] don't I don't deal with it anymore then
[30:43] like four years later it's like what is
[30:46] it 60,000 or it's crashed down to 30,000
[30:49] okay I will not deal with it again but
[30:51] the third time or fourth time or fifth
[30:53] time when they see it Rising again and
[30:56] they they seeing lowering again at some
[30:58] point it will make click for them and
[31:00] they're like this this thing seems to
[31:02] just not go away and just keeps on
[31:04] growing and just keeps on making uh more
[31:08] waves of adoption like all of the sudden
[31:10] we have companies countries and everyone
[31:12] in in there uh and we're just at a start
[31:15] of it and there's an ETF there's like
[31:17] there's so many different things
[31:18] happening and I feel like
[31:21] um we will probably hit a point in the
[31:24] next few months or maybe one two years
[31:26] where it can have has this high again um
[31:30] Maybe not maybe it comes later maybe it
[31:32] comes earlier who knows of the timing
[31:34] but probably will have hit again this
[31:36] point where uh the price Rises and then
[31:39] all of the sudden everybody's like what
[31:42] this this all happened but we Bitcoin I
[31:44] know like the priz is just the the third
[31:48] consequence of that like first a lot of
[31:50] things happened a lot of things got
[31:52] built a lot of Education got done uh and
[31:56] then the price moved moves after that uh
[31:59] when everything comes and and and and
[32:02] it's kind of shows what what what theit
[32:04] Bitcoin Community has been been doing
[32:06] for for the last four years and it's
[32:09] it's interesting how uh at least for now
[32:12] I think now it's really calm time um
[32:15] yeah it's it's it's a it's a cool
[32:17] concept um but one of the yeah note here
[32:22] yeah no I uh I think everybody has like
[32:25] two or three touch points with Bitcoin
[32:27] before they actually start to take it
[32:29] seriously and for a lot of people I've
[32:31] met so many people where 2020 was the
[32:34] time that really woke them up you know
[32:36] and partly I think it was because world
[32:37] really slowed down and for the first
[32:39] time there was enough time to stop what
[32:42] you were doing and pay attention and
[32:44] maybe start watching some videos on
[32:46] YouTube or or whatever it was like I was
[32:49] um I I first remember Bitcoin in 2013
[32:52] that was my first touch point the coffee
[32:54] shop uh in the the main floor of the
[32:56] building I was living in at at that time
[32:59] right next to it was a a coin store like
[33:01] a coin and stamp store that sold Bitcoin
[33:04] and I remember uh having a coffee there
[33:07] like every day and looking at this
[33:08] Bitcoin sign in the window and just
[33:09] thinking like who would be stupid enough
[33:11] to you know put some of their money in
[33:13] this Bitcoin thing and uh yeah so this
[33:16] is uh you know we we all sort of get the
[33:19] price we deserve I I uh I completely
[33:21] believe that not in a not in a not in a
[33:24] you know this person is better than you
[33:27] idea but in just in the way of like you
[33:29] you get B Bitcoin when you are ready to
[33:33] pay serious attention and dig into the
[33:35] idea enough to understand that it is
[33:37] serious and has intellectual Merit and
[33:41] you have to push through all of the
[33:42] noise and natural reasons why people
[33:46] might want to discard it and move on or
[33:48] just it has to do with time I think it's
[33:51] it's when you are willing to commit to
[33:54] enough time to properly consider the
[33:57] possibil
[33:58] that Bitcoin is serious if you are
[34:00] listening to this podcast you might be
[34:02] wondering what is actually the setup
[34:04] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[34:07] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[34:09] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[34:10] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[34:13] right way let's focus on the first thing
[34:15] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[34:17] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[34:20] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[34:22] an exchange that has an own token or
[34:24] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[34:26] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[34:29] for me the best partner for that and now
[34:33] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[34:34] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[34:37] a self custody solution where you
[34:40] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[34:43] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[34:46] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[34:49] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[34:51] fres and you are better than 95% of all
[34:55] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[34:57] th000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[35:01] have one last thing before we get back
[35:03] to the video I'm really passionate about
[35:05] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[35:07] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[35:10] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[35:13] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[35:16] conference in whole of Europe for all
[35:18] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[35:21] this place in June for all europees it's
[35:23] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[35:26] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[35:28] to come I will do interviews there and I
[35:31] would love to meet you all there use
[35:33] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[35:36] discounts and use the links down in the
[35:39] description and it's it's funny how we
[35:41] form an opinion on something and I did
[35:44] this did exactly the same thing as you
[35:46] did and I think almost everybody does it
[35:49] we form an opinion before we even really
[35:52] know about it like we here we read some
[35:55] story we we read some headline
[35:58] somewhere uh wherever we we got it and
[36:01] then uh we see it and we make an opinion
[36:03] or we got asked and make an opinion and
[36:06] I'm really trying really hard and it's
[36:08] extremely difficult to not form opinions
[36:12] on everything because I know little to
[36:16] nothing of most of the topics in the
[36:18] world and I'm this weird friend that
[36:22] says when he's asked like oh what do you
[36:24] think of that and I'm like sorry I have
[36:26] have no clue about that I have no
[36:28] opinion on that it's just in is a topic
[36:30] that just does not interest me right now
[36:33] you can tell me more about it but I have
[36:35] I I have not an good input to give and
[36:39] certainly no final opinion on on
[36:41] anything especially now with elections
[36:44] and then everybody is wants to talk
[36:46] politics uh now more more so it's it's
[36:49] like for me it's a good step to just
[36:52] sometimes not make an opinion and if it
[36:56] interests you then deep research and
[36:58] then make an opinion out of that but
[37:00] it's a it's a hard thing to do I feel
[37:01] like the the human brain always wants to
[37:04] uh Pro prove that it's it's a a great
[37:09] great thing so so this is a great
[37:11] example I think of how Bitcoin is the
[37:14] foundation for this Golden Age of Reason
[37:16] is like this is a a perfect single
[37:19] person example of one person uh learning
[37:23] seeing at one time this expectation of
[37:25] rules or something that makes sense and
[37:26] or understand understanding that I
[37:28] didn't understand something before and
[37:30] now I do and now that I have done that I
[37:33] realize that when I do it with other
[37:35] things I'm doing the thing that made me
[37:37] not understand Bitcoin in the first
[37:38] place so it's like it's a paradigm for
[37:41] you to now start thinking about
[37:43] everything in a new way and it's like
[37:45] this is something that changes people
[37:47] from the inside out it changes
[37:49] everything about how you approach you
[37:52] know problem solving interacting with
[37:54] other people all of these fundamental
[37:55] principles and what's so cool about
[37:57] Bitcoin is because the rules don't
[38:00] change uh and it's externally auditable
[38:03] everybody has the same opportunity to
[38:05] sort of synchronize themselves to this
[38:07] system so it's it's a it's a gift that
[38:10] everyone can receive it's just a matter
[38:13] of um you know time and people having
[38:16] the uh the willingness to uh ponder
[38:21] it how how will this look like I think
[38:24] it's an almost
[38:25] impossible uh answer answering this this
[38:29] question but how how will a world be
[38:32] different when we all of the sudden are
[38:34] all on this this Bitcoin standard we all
[38:38] went through some sort of this humbling
[38:41] experience of this uh experience that oh
[38:44] we we were not right at that time and
[38:47] now we we have to adopt Bitcoin at a
[38:50] later time because I also saw Bitcoin uh
[38:53] almost four years earlier and formed an
[38:55] opinion and I had three years long that
[38:57] opinion that Bitcoin is a scam MH till I
[39:01] had one weekend where I actually
[39:02] researched it and I was like oh [ __ ] I
[39:05] was wrong for three years uh which is a
[39:07] humbling experience uh but but how does
[39:11] the world look like on on on a Bitcoin
[39:13] standard and and on on this Golden Age
[39:15] what you're talking about you know I
[39:17] think that it will look so first I think
[39:20] what what's really one of the most
[39:22] interesting things about Bitcoin is that
[39:24] even the people who understand it the
[39:25] best or have been thinking about it the
[39:27] longest are still having new ideas about
[39:29] it all the time so it's not like you get
[39:32] Bitcoin and then you're done like if you
[39:33] think about people like Jeff Booth who
[39:35] are on all the podcasts all the time
[39:38] he's still having new new realizations
[39:40] and new aha moments like he's still on
[39:43] his own Journey so it's it's there's not
[39:45] an end point it's a it's a
[39:47] transformation that I think we we don't
[39:49] even really know where it's going so um
[39:52] so that's one really interesting aspect
[39:54] of wondering about what it looks like
[39:56] when uh a sufficient number of society
[39:59] has experienced this transformation and
[40:02] some people are even further along than
[40:04] they are now uh but I think the the
[40:06] answer to that is it will be as
[40:09] different as you know how things are now
[40:13] from you know 300 years ago 800 years
[40:16] ago a thousand years ago where it's hard
[40:18] to even imagine how people were living
[40:20] at that time people will look back at
[40:23] what we're doing exactly right now and
[40:25] think I can't believe they used to do
[40:27] that I can't believe they used to let
[40:30] somebody be in charge of making the
[40:32] money and then they would just make it
[40:33] worthless and there was no control
[40:36] mechanism and nobody had an expectation
[40:38] that the money would be something that
[40:40] retained its value into the future
[40:42] that's insane you know and like all of
[40:44] the things that resulted from that like
[40:47] as if people will look back and think
[40:49] like why would every country want to
[40:51] manage their own money and like why
[40:53] would countries want to trade each
[40:55] other's meaningless paper with each
[40:57] other like it's just it's just a
[40:59] technology from a from a dated era of of
[41:04] uh human civilization you know this is
[41:05] something that was an an innovation you
[41:08] know 100 years ago with the creation of
[41:10] central banks we needed a way to move
[41:13] money very quickly around the world so
[41:15] gold transformed into this paper
[41:17] representation of gold so that it would
[41:20] enable a a new era of of uh
[41:22] international trade and that that made
[41:24] sense but technology has changed a lot
[41:27] lot over the last 100 years right and uh
[41:30] what I think is just what needs to catch
[41:32] up now to the reality of technology
[41:35] today is human consciousness like we
[41:38] just we now need to catch up with the
[41:41] way we think about things to in a way
[41:44] that matches the reality of what is
[41:46] possible with technology and that's
[41:47] getting harder and harder because the
[41:49] pace of technological advancement is
[41:52] seemingly advancing at a rate that's
[41:54] like it's it's difficult to keep track
[41:56] of how fast things are moving so I think
[41:59] it's like you know at a at a species
[42:04] level it's almost like waking up out of
[42:06] a dream and when you've been sleeping
[42:08] and you're you're sort of like deep in a
[42:10] slumber it's not obvious uh you know
[42:13] maybe that you're even asleep and then
[42:15] you you know the process of waking up
[42:17] and then you when you when you're awake
[42:19] now it's it's almost becomes then
[42:23] difficult to remember the dream and uh
[42:26] these things happen at a at a different
[42:29] uh time scale if you're instead of
[42:31] thinking about one person if you're
[42:32] thinking about all of humanity so
[42:34] instead of like you know a matter of
[42:35] minutes then this could be like decades
[42:38] but I think that's what's going on right
[42:40] now is that we have been uh thinking
[42:43] about things one way and we're at the
[42:45] end of that time and now what we're
[42:48] we're slowly waking up out of this deep
[42:50] Slumber and what will come on the other
[42:53] side of this
[42:55] is people just fundamentally thinking
[42:57] about because it's more than money right
[42:59] it's property if you start thinking that
[43:01] people will entirely Imagine Property
[43:04] differently then then they're going to
[43:05] start imagining you know their their
[43:08] goals differently like you there's going
[43:10] to be no point to try and own four
[43:13] houses so that you can have three of
[43:15] them be airbnbs in the in that Bitcoin
[43:18] future so it's just going to
[43:20] fundamentally change the way we think
[43:22] about our motivations for doing things
[43:25] and for collecting things having things
[43:28] um it it's like it's a new language for
[43:32] exchanging things with each other and um
[43:36] yeah and so I I think it's going to
[43:39] completely it's unavoidable there will
[43:41] totally change human
[43:43] civilization could it lead to an
[43:46] abundant future where because of a sound
[43:50] money standard and productivity ever
[43:52] increasing with robotics Ai and what
[43:55] whatnot um and all those things coming
[43:58] into one place uh that maybe everything
[44:04] that we have to do to survive is kind of
[44:08] cared for like we have all the systems
[44:10] and the processes and infrastructure in
[44:12] place where the
[44:14] humankind uh can really focus on the
[44:18] next things like I don't know space
[44:20] exploration or some art things or they
[44:23] can they can basically do what what they
[44:26] uh tend to to really love and really
[44:28] like and really want to explore and not
[44:31] to like have this or we I feel like most
[44:34] of society now has to like really
[44:36] struggle like keep up with the bills
[44:38] keep up with the things uh and and only
[44:41] a small percentage of humanity can
[44:43] actually uh enjoy the fruits of life and
[44:47] and really like uh enjoy reading a book
[44:50] uh on a day just like diving deep into
[44:53] topics but if we come to this world
[44:56] where everything thing is getting
[44:58] cheaper and cheaper because we get
[45:00] better and better in producing it and we
[45:02] have this abundant future uh with with
[45:04] the golden age what ux described could
[45:06] we come to like a point where we we as
[45:10] hum kinds have kind of figured
[45:12] everything out and and uh we we live in
[45:14] this uh dream world which which I don't
[45:18] even want to dream
[45:20] of Utopia yeah um you know so you live
[45:25] in one of the most beautiful cities in
[45:26] the world
[45:27] and the the reason uh you know I think
[45:31] that we this is this is such a great
[45:33] example of us how we will look back at
[45:36] the time we're living in now and just
[45:38] think of it as as being very as a very
[45:41] dark time
[45:43] because architecture is is one of the
[45:45] best examples of the you know the world
[45:48] that we create for ourselves is a
[45:50] reflection of how we are imagining and
[45:53] thinking about that world and the stuff
[45:56] that we were building hundreds of years
[45:58] ago in cities like Vienna are these
[46:02] Timeless uh works of art that are really
[46:05] you know when you when you see sort of
[46:08] the the um the
[46:11] uh uh The Gardens and the the classical
[46:15] palaces in Vienna what you are felt with
[46:18] is this feeling of uh uh the expansion
[46:22] of your imagination you know this is our
[46:25] architecture that is designed to uplift
[46:27] and Inspire
[46:29] and people would never be able to build
[46:32] buildings like that today not because
[46:35] maybe we don't have the technology but
[46:37] because it in a Fiat world we have to
[46:40] build things to make money and there's
[46:42] no way that you could make money
[46:44] building a building that took 30 years
[46:46] to build and uh was designed to last
[46:50] forever like we have to build things so
[46:52] that they break and then we get to build
[46:53] them again and make money again by
[46:55] replacing them with something new
[46:57] and and and so this has created over
[47:00] over a longer period of time decades
[47:03] it's kind of like degradation of culture
[47:06] what we're doing is building an
[47:08] environment for ourselves that is
[47:10] disposable we live in this fast food
[47:12] world that lacks sort of imagination and
[47:14] inspiration and this is why when you go
[47:16] to a city like Vienna what you see are
[47:18] these you know incredible works of art
[47:21] next to these like soulless glass
[47:24] buildings that have you know a thousand
[47:27] years if if if like if civilization
[47:30] ended tomorrow and Aliens arrived in a
[47:33] thousand years the glass buildings would
[47:36] be gone H and the and those uh you know
[47:39] 18th century 17th century buildings
[47:41] would probably still be there and they
[47:43] would probably look just about exactly
[47:45] the same because they were designed to
[47:47] last and so even that concept I think is
[47:51] when we're building the buildings like
[47:52] we're building today and living in them
[47:55] it's we understand on some level like
[47:57] we're taking in all this information all
[47:59] the time and so what we we very much now
[48:02] are all products of this Fiat society
[48:06] that that is pervasive through all
[48:09] elements of how we interact with each
[48:12] other and and one of the best ways we
[48:14] can see this is by actually just
[48:17] stopping and looking at the world that
[48:19] we're building for ourselves that we
[48:21] have to as a result of this and I so I
[48:23] think that's going to change like
[48:25] architecture I think we're going to stop
[48:27] building these temporary structures
[48:31] these like devoid of imagination and we
[48:35] we're just going to expand and start
[48:36] thinking about possibilities in new ways
[48:39] because we would be able to build
[48:40] incredible things if it wasn't about if
[48:44] if it wasn't based on Fiat
[48:48] profit I I love that uh that that few
[48:51] and I think uh and and yeah Vienna is an
[48:54] amazing example I'm I'm not that far
[48:57] away I can I walk there I I mean I'm
[49:01] still like uh now I'm the fourth day in
[49:04] Vienna so I'm I'm not a Vienna expert
[49:07] now but I uh have like I don't know 20
[49:10] minutes to walk to the shinr Palace uh
[49:14] which an amazing big Palace really
[49:17] beautiful really big space uh and and
[49:20] you can just go there and enjoy the the
[49:23] fewu and enjoy the the architecture uh
[49:26] even there are like concerts free
[49:28] concert where where people can go there
[49:30] and there's like old classical move old
[49:33] classical uh uh music playing so it's a
[49:37] it's a wonderful experience and it's
[49:39] kind of like the window in this this
[49:41] this time where in this golden age uh
[49:44] that uh that we we could imagine and
[49:47] it's I love it a lot and one thing from
[49:49] the book that I still wanted to touch on
[49:51] is uh the subtitle and the subtitle is
[49:55] towards a cosmology of energy money what
[49:58] what is energy money for
[50:01] you uh thank you for asking that
[50:03] question I thought very carefully about
[50:06] the subtitle of the book because um and
[50:09] I and I sort of chose every every word
[50:11] carefully and so firstly maybe cosmology
[50:15] is a money that H is excuse me is a word
[50:17] that has to do with understanding
[50:20] something's place in the universe and uh
[50:23] so so I think that it relates first to
[50:26] the idea of the bigger concept of what
[50:30] is what does energy money mean for us uh
[50:34] you know how does it help us how does it
[50:36] change our understanding of the universe
[50:39] of existence and uh energy money you
[50:43] know to
[50:44] me I I think about Bitcoin this is how I
[50:47] imagine Bitcoin is Bitcoin is a is a
[50:51] monetary system where the underlying
[50:53] commodity or the thing that produces or
[50:57] guarantees the value uh the commodity in
[51:01] Bitcoin is energy and so it's a system
[51:04] where energy goes in and then the output
[51:08] or the product is money is this is is
[51:11] Bitcoin and uh it's a system that
[51:14] enables us to transform energy into
[51:18] money and what we do with our own body
[51:23] is we transform energy into money you
[51:25] know we we turn our our time and our
[51:28] physical effort into a product or a
[51:30] service and that thing is transformed
[51:33] into energy sorry is it transformed into
[51:36] money and so money should have a
[51:39] relationship to energy it it makes sense
[51:42] that money should have a have a be tied
[51:45] to reality through the consumption of
[51:47] energy and Bitcoin is energy money
[51:50] because it also consumes energy in its
[51:53] production and so it has an intrinsic
[51:55] connection to energy and this Dow
[51:58] principle is that everything is
[51:59] connected by energy so it makes sense
[52:02] that the one uniting factor to connect
[52:05] all of humanity would be also a money
[52:07] that is also connected to energy so I
[52:10] think that uh there is a really
[52:13] interesting uh sort of
[52:15] philosophical uh comparison to be made
[52:18] when we are exchanging money we are
[52:21] actually exchanging energy if I had to
[52:23] work to earn money and I'm going to give
[52:26] you that money to uh in exchange for
[52:29] something that you are have used your
[52:31] energy to create that that is an
[52:33] exchange of energy we're just using
[52:36] something in between to measure how much
[52:39] of my energy I'm trading for how much of
[52:41] your energy and so there's sort of that
[52:44] aspect of it that is you know so very
[52:47] philosophical or metaphysical and then
[52:50] on the other side it is very literal we
[52:53] know exactly how much energy is consumed
[52:55] in mind a block it's measurable and
[52:58] Bitcoin allows us to start thinking
[53:00] about energy sort of at a planetary
[53:03] level we have now with Bitcoin a way to
[53:06] turn energy that would otherwise be
[53:08] useless because it is you know in some
[53:11] remote Hydro uh you know a Bitcoin mine
[53:15] uh being powered by a remote River in
[53:17] somewhere in Africa well now somebody
[53:20] there can turn that into electricity
[53:22] turn it into money send that money
[53:25] elsewhere you know so they can capture
[53:27] that energy and and it's a way for us to
[53:30] think about all of the energy that is
[53:32] available to us on Earth and you United
[53:37] in a in a in a single system of
[53:39] measuring and
[53:41] appropriately valuing and connecting
[53:44] everything so all of a sudden energy
[53:46] that is in Africa can be sent to Russia
[53:49] in in the form of money uh in the same
[53:52] way it it's connecting everything uh so
[53:56] so that's sort of the idea Bitcoin is an
[53:57] energy money system that has the ability
[54:00] to to connect everything yeah and it's
[54:03] it's it's the next step to climb up the
[54:06] ladder I forgot how this model Works uh
[54:08] how this model is named but we are
[54:10] coming to a type one civilization and
[54:12] then maybe expanding
[54:15] the yeah yeah thank you thank you the
[54:17] card scale uh yeah it's it's it's it's
[54:19] fascinating think of of that it's kind
[54:21] of like a a measuring tool also for time
[54:25] uh and when you adopt the Bitcoin
[54:27] standard for me at least I value my time
[54:30] and my uh energy and and my where I
[54:34] spend money completely different because
[54:36] whenever you spend uh money you have to
[54:40] now think of like oh would I buy this
[54:43] also if it would be 2x like the price
[54:47] because Bitcoin can go up really quickly
[54:51] uh um and in in price or the price
[54:54] measured in Bitcoin could fall really
[54:56] quickly in the the next few uh weeks
[54:59] when we look at that item um so whenever
[55:02] I spend money whenever I spend time with
[55:06] someone uh I way more careful of of why
[55:09] I do that and and and try to get like
[55:11] what do I really want and what do I
[55:13] really like and and that's that's
[55:17] distinguishes I think the this this
[55:20] feared mindset from a a Bitcoin mindset
[55:23] where we value our resources a lot
[55:26] and not just throw all the resources out
[55:29] there and hope that something sticks we
[55:32] really try like we we try to get
[55:34] something right yeah and I and I think
[55:36] it's because when you're using Bitcoin
[55:38] You're Now using a system that has the
[55:41] ability to store your energy and your
[55:42] time so like I was saying about for you
[55:44] to earn money you know it's some
[55:46] combination of your time and energy
[55:48] those two things are the input and then
[55:50] the output is money and in the Fiat
[55:53] money system um you know both of those
[55:57] things are diminished or devalued as the
[55:59] value of the money erodes so you have no
[56:01] ability in the Fiat money system to
[56:04] store your energy or your time and so
[56:07] there's no value on time there is no way
[56:09] to properly value your time so it's
[56:12] almost better to think about to not
[56:14] think about it and this is why people I
[56:15] think you know use even these
[56:17] expressions like time flies or you know
[56:20] blowing their money it's like when you
[56:22] think about why would anybody blowing
[56:25] your money is like the idea of like
[56:26] scattering the dust out of the palm of
[56:28] your hand you're like right and uh if
[56:32] something was really valuable why would
[56:34] you waste it why would you why would you
[56:36] waste your money if it was truly a
[56:38] representation of time which is actually
[56:41] the most valuable thing anyone has the
[56:43] one thing that we have that is
[56:45] absolutely all finite for each of us is
[56:48] time and so what the Fiat money system
[56:51] does is it
[56:53] actually compresses the value of your
[56:56] time time and there's no limit to how
[56:58] far it can compress that value as it it
[57:00] because it can continue to lose diminish
[57:03] that value infinitely and when it's
[57:06] doing that it is diminishing the value
[57:08] of the time that you spent to earn that
[57:10] money so you have no way to store your
[57:12] time you have no way to
[57:15] appropriately um preserve it and and so
[57:19] I think that's a very painful thought
[57:20] that's a very that's a very sad place to
[57:23] be and so this is also why I think
[57:25] bitcoiners can become very optimistic
[57:27] and why they change their their
[57:29] preference for how they spend their time
[57:32] is because when you adopt a Bitcoin way
[57:35] of thinking now all of a sudden your
[57:37] time is actually appreciating you're
[57:39] almost gaining time because you have a
[57:41] feeling that into the distant future you
[57:44] have the ability to store that energy
[57:46] and time effectively so it's not flying
[57:50] it's not going you know it's not like
[57:52] floating out of the palm of your hand
[57:54] it's stored it it's a Immortal you know
[57:57] that Bitcoin is a system that allows you
[57:59] to preserve that energy and uh so then
[58:04] it it removes the threat of having
[58:06] someone steal your time from you which I
[58:09] think is sort of the fundamental way
[58:11] that it'll let enables people if I'm not
[58:13] worried about my time being stolen then
[58:16] I don't need to steal yours you know
[58:17] it's like I'm I I can I can go out and
[58:20] we can have an interaction with each
[58:22] other and both of us have this sort of
[58:24] sense of security it's it's a complet
[58:26] new way for us to think about
[58:28] interacting with each other like that I
[58:29] think this is this is also one of the
[58:32] core ideas about dosm and Bitcoin
[58:34] together is a Daoism is very much a
[58:37] personal Journey it's an internal thing
[58:39] that happens and then as a result of
[58:41] having this internal reflection a
[58:43] transformation of your way of thinking
[58:45] about interacting with this force it
[58:48] then changes the way you would interact
[58:49] with other people who are having a
[58:51] similar experience and then as many
[58:54] people have this change
[58:57] experience that creates a society and
[59:00] this is exactly the same thing that's
[59:02] happening with Bitcoin is people are
[59:03] experiencing an Awakening they're
[59:06] experiencing a new way of thinking about
[59:08] things and as a result of those thoughts
[59:11] they're going out and they're connecting
[59:12] with other people that are having
[59:14] similar ideas this is how we're on this
[59:16] podcast right now and this is the early
[59:19] stages of this Golden Age of Reason it's
[59:22] just very early but imagine as that
[59:24] number is like 2 48 16 32 64 we're we're
[59:28] watching this process unfold right now
[59:31] and I think that uh that so that hinges
[59:34] on this virality the Unstoppable nature
[59:37] of the human mind's capacity to be
[59:40] awakened I think we we can all have this
[59:43] experience and uh it will happen with
[59:46] enough
[59:47] time it's uh it's fascinating to talk
[59:50] with your your clearly deep finger it's
[59:53] like I have so many um topics already
[59:56] written down and and was like we we
[59:58] should also get in your Bitcoin for
[60:00] financial advisor book and and what
[60:01] you're doing at block reward and and
[60:03] you're also hosting a podcast uh but we
[60:05] already one hour mark
[60:08] so uh we we probably like just make a
[60:11] second round at at half a year or a year
[60:13] and and take take other topics on there
[60:16] uh so thank you for for that already um
[60:19] but before we come to our end routine
[60:21] and before we end the podcast uh um I
[60:23] always ask one question to bitcoiners
[60:26] what are you currently passionate about
[60:29] deeply learning besides of Bitcoin like
[60:32] what are you really passionate about
[60:34] besides the whole Bitcoin
[60:36] conversation oh uh interesting question
[60:42] um I would say I have uh over since
[60:45] finishing the book I have resumed uh my
[60:48] studying Mandarin because I have an
[60:51] ambition to uh be able to converse some
[60:55] of these ideas is uh with with
[60:58] bitcoiners in China and I'm I'm very
[61:01] curious to know what the Bitcoin
[61:03] conversation in China is like uh and I
[61:06] and I hope to translate the book to
[61:09] Mandarin and uh so I so I it's a study
[61:13] that I have been uh uh coming and going
[61:16] on for for sort of 20 years and um you
[61:19] know you get you get busy with life and
[61:21] I and I live somewhere in Canada there's
[61:23] not much opportunity to uh to to use it
[61:26] on a day-to-day basis but uh that's
[61:28] that's what I'm working on right now
[61:29] amazing how how does um do you already
[61:32] have any insights in how uh Chinese
[61:35] people I mean we know how the Chinese
[61:37] government look at look at at Bitcoin
[61:40] yeah my my understanding is that it's
[61:42] very popular you know I think that one
[61:44] of the for people who have spent time in
[61:46] China you understand that um what is
[61:49] reported on the outside for Outsiders
[61:52] versus the reality of what it's like
[61:54] there is always very different different
[61:56] and even things like um you know I think
[62:00] generally the perception in the west is
[62:02] that people there are much less free and
[62:06] I had a very different experience during
[62:08] my my time in China I think the average
[62:10] person in China is maybe actually more
[62:12] free than people are in the west today
[62:16] it because there are so many people in
[62:18] China it's very difficult to uh enforce
[62:22] a lot of the the the smaller rules that
[62:25] in y Europe or in North America you know
[62:28] we we've we've kind of gradually become
[62:31] uh very almost overg governed uh you
[62:34] know and this is something that has been
[62:36] a a growing problem I think I think in
[62:38] the west and as as technology has enal
[62:42] you sort greater surveillance by
[62:44] governments uh they they have all these
[62:46] things in China too but it's just a
[62:48] totally different Dynamic so I think
[62:49] that uh they are very free people in in
[62:52] their own way personal Liberties are are
[62:56] a sort of a a core a a core part of
[62:59] Chinese culture as well so I I think
[63:01] that uh from what I can tell Bitcoin is
[63:03] alive and
[63:05] thriving uh it's just not as uh not as
[63:08] open or it's not maybe what is being
[63:10] presented on the international
[63:12] media it's interesting uh because you're
[63:15] the second guest that actually says uh
[63:19] that Chinese people are way more free uh
[63:22] than than uh in the US I think Michelle
[63:26] weekly made this example of when she
[63:29] traveled around the world and she was in
[63:30] a lot of different countries also in
[63:32] China also in Dubai and also other
[63:34] countries in Europe uh and when she then
[63:37] came back to the United States and she
[63:40] tried to speak with like uh friends and
[63:43] families about topics and there was like
[63:46] topics of politics there was this topic
[63:48] of other other things and they were like
[63:51] oh you cannot talk about that and it's
[63:53] like it's a different form of of uh
[63:56] censorship going on in different parts
[63:59] of the world but it's very interesting
[64:01] how how this the the Dynamics of the
[64:04] different countes and the Dynamics of
[64:06] freedom of speech and freedom in general
[64:09] uh is is going I'm I'm yeah I'm pretty
[64:11] satisfied actually with the freedom you
[64:13] have in Austria I'm not satisfied with
[64:15] the tax rates I'm not satisfied with the
[64:17] bureaucracy but with the freedom in
[64:19] general I'm I'm quite satisfied uh even
[64:22] though there's a lot of um weird things
[64:24] coming from the European Union uh but
[64:27] it's nothing that really bothers me at
[64:31] this point there are some proposals that
[64:33] could bother me a lot but uh that that's
[64:36] future let's see let's see how it all
[64:38] shapes out uh perfect then yeah you have
[64:42] not yeah just maybe on that you know I I
[64:44] think it's they're all just really
[64:46] relative things and uh so they could be
[64:49] small things there things that are so
[64:50] small we don't even think about them
[64:52] like in Canada you need to get a
[64:54] permission uh you need to a permit from
[64:56] your local government to change a toilet
[64:59] in your house you know the so it's like
[65:02] you know we just uh there's there's some
[65:06] things have just maybe changed like you
[65:08] then you go to a country like Nicaragua
[65:10] and like you don't need permission to do
[65:12] anything you buy a piece of land and you
[65:14] just start building on it and like so
[65:16] there's a broad spectrum of of what
[65:18] we're allowed to do and what we think of
[65:20] as being like you know uh control it's
[65:24] it's fascinating time to be
[65:27] alive what is uh freedom for you uh oh
[65:31] that's a good question you know I I
[65:33] would have answered it one way I think
[65:35] uh until like maybe four years ago and
[65:37] and now now it's very different uh you
[65:41] know I I think it it I would have always
[65:44] just thought about it as having the
[65:46] ability to sort of move freely and um
[65:51] and feel that the government is um
[65:56] working on your behalf to organize
[65:59] people in a way that is safe and fair
[66:01] for everyone and and that's kind of what
[66:03] I what I think it should be I think
[66:06] that um freedom is really you know
[66:10] having the ability to to pursue the the
[66:13] life that you want as long as that's not
[66:15] doing anything that's really hurting
[66:17] anyone else and uh yeah that that's
[66:20] probably what I would
[66:21] say fre Freedom uh goes as far as the
[66:25] fre them from someone else's starts so
[66:28] that's it's a line that I I really liked
[66:30] and that I heard a lot um perfect then
[66:33] let's get to the end routine of our
[66:34] podcast where the previous guest is
[66:36] asking a question for the next guest
[66:38] without knowing who the next guest
[66:40] actually is so it's it's always like a
[66:42] little bit of a different question it's
[66:44] also a little bit not tailored to the
[66:46] guest which I really like and your
[66:49] question is what would you say to your
[66:51] younger self when you were like 15 years
[66:53] old or 16 years old which is not about
[66:56] Bitcoin holy what would I say to my
[66:59] younger self you know I I probably would
[67:02] say uh start learning languages I I grew
[67:05] up in a in a part of Canada that is very
[67:08] English speaking English speaking only
[67:10] and uh when I was in my teenage years it
[67:13] wasn't very obvious for me that I would
[67:15] want maybe in the future to have the
[67:17] opportunity to communicate with people
[67:20] in other languages and it's something
[67:22] that has been um uh it's you know the
[67:26] older you get I think for most people
[67:28] the more difficult it is to to learn
[67:30] languages and people like probably
[67:32] yourself who very fortunate when you
[67:34] grow up in in areas where i' I've met
[67:37] people from Central Europe and they know
[67:38] like six or eight languages just because
[67:41] that that's just a very normal thing and
[67:43] I've always been envious of of of those
[67:46] of of that opportunity so studying
[67:49] languages would be uh because I also
[67:51] think that um you know learning how to
[67:54] think about to express ideas in a in a
[67:57] in a different language changes your
[67:58] ability to think about expression it
[68:01] makes you more of a uh you know really
[68:05] expands your mind so uh so that would be
[68:08] uh that would be my
[68:10] answer yeah unfortunately I don't speak
[68:12] six eight languages I would love to I
[68:15] only speak uh English and German I have
[68:18] some Roots uh also in France so uh there
[68:22] was this time where I try to learn uh uh
[68:25] the French language uh but I'm I'm I'm
[68:29] like only German and English I really
[68:31] know like German is my native language
[68:33] uh English I kind of forc myself to
[68:35] really learn good so I can speak on the
[68:37] podcast I also have an Indian girlfriend
[68:40] she's teaching me a little bit Hindi uh
[68:43] the the the language of of of India but
[68:47] uh it's it's language I'm I'm really not
[68:49] good in languages unfortunately but yeah
[68:52] that's just a side note uh usually in in
[68:55] the middle of of Europe people actually
[68:57] it's not rare that people speak like uh
[69:01] one two three additional languages to
[69:03] their mother language and they also like
[69:07] those Austria has a a little bit of a
[69:10] different way of saying something than
[69:13] Germans then there is Swiss where there
[69:15] are like different kind of German also
[69:18] uh then there's like Czech and Slovakia
[69:21] where they they can understand each
[69:23] other but it's a different language so
[69:25] lot of interesting uh patterns uh and
[69:29] and things about language in in in
[69:31] middle of Europe uh and we are
[69:33] definitely I don't know if you're more
[69:35] inclined to to to learn about languages
[69:38] but we're definitely inclined to learn
[69:40] about languages and this is probably a
[69:42] little bit different in America and
[69:45] English speaking areas where they just
[69:48] don't really have the need to speak
[69:50] other languages because wherever they go
[69:52] they can speak English and almost
[69:53] everybody understands them to a certain
[69:56] degree uh and this is something uh yeah
[70:00] a big difference but yeah um yeah in
[70:02] English speaking people have this really
[70:04] weird and kind of unfortunate
[70:07] expectation that other people will speak
[70:09] English right it's like uh yeah yeah
[70:12] it's it's it's probably coming from when
[70:15] when so many people speak English and
[70:17] most understand you you kind of expect
[70:20] it and there's this nice chart I have
[70:22] now in my mind where um when you when
[70:26] you are as an English speaker you're
[70:27] coming to to Europe and you try to speak
[70:30] that uh uh um the native language and
[70:33] there's like this the German Way is like
[70:36] oh oh no no I can also speak English
[70:37] it's okay you don't have to try and
[70:40] there's this different reactions in the
[70:41] different part of world I love that
[70:43] charge a lot perfect then yeah thank you
