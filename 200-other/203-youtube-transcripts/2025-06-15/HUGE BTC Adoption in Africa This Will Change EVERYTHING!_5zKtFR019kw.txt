[00:00] the kind of problems that Bitcoin solves
[00:02] in Africa are massive they change the
[00:04] entire sphere of how things operate in
[00:07] the ecosystem in Africa here the fact
[00:09] that bcoin itself is decentralized so it
[00:11] breaks so many barriers even if I do
[00:13] have my own money and I want to spend I
[00:15] need permission for my husband but with
[00:17] Bitcoin I don't need my husband to sign
[00:20] off off any bank account before I'm able
[00:22] to hold money Bitcoin creates freedom I
[00:24] had some issues at home and I had to
[00:26] leave the house so in 2018 with no job
[00:28] no money so nothing to my name I became
[00:31] homeless what are the conditions that
[00:33] the company say like oh you you have to
[00:35] do this otherwise you you cannot come
[00:37] work for us all of these people were men
[00:39] and for all of them they all wanted
[00:41] sexual favors every single one of them
[00:43] wanted sexual favor I was a single
[00:45] person before I was going but in order
[00:46] to survive I had to live with a man and
[00:49] that is how I brought for my daughter
[00:52] and how big of a a step forward is
[00:55] Bitcoin now it's a Lifeline it's a
[00:58] lifechanging Lifeline right now as I st
[01:00] here no one can command me on what to do
[01:02] I have my own finances I decide what I
[01:04] want to
[01:05] [Music]
[01:09] do you're from from Ghana and I'm really
[01:12] curious because I never visited the the
[01:14] the planet the planet the the continent
[01:16] even um how is uh Africa how is Ghana
[01:20] doing in the Bitcoin adoption what are
[01:21] you seeing there how is it
[01:24] going uh well in Africa in general uh
[01:28] biton adoption is evolved
[01:31] lots of people are accepting it I think
[01:33] in afria we have 80% that are aware of
[01:36] Bitcoin right so it's it's evolving lots
[01:38] of people are hearing about it it's the
[01:40] only problem is the adoption and
[01:42] acceptance that is what is here to talk
[01:46] about that is what we're working for
[01:48] currently yeah interesting and uh you're
[01:51] working with what was it bit farzy bit F
[01:55] it's Bitcoin and then
[01:57] f f oh okay I get it
[02:02] what are you doing there uh well we are
[02:04] a nonprofit organization focused on
[02:06] empowering women in Africa through
[02:09] financial education with a focus on
[02:11] bitcoin we're trying to our mission is
[02:13] to bridge the gender gap and assessible
[02:16] financial knowledge providing women with
[02:18] the skills and tools to be able to
[02:20] thrive in the financial evolving
[02:22] landscape yeah the fastpaced evolving
[02:25] landscape yeah what what how big of a
[02:28] problem is uh Financial education
[02:32] currently um in Africa especially with
[02:35] women like what what is what are you
[02:37] seeing there is financial education
[02:40] there uh or like how many people know
[02:42] about that like how paint this a picture
[02:45] of like how is financial education and
[02:47] literacy in in Africa in Africa or for
[02:51] women in Africa um maybe both like maybe
[02:54] it would be interesting to know like how
[02:55] in general and how it then it's like for
[02:57] women specially so Financial education
[03:00] in Africa
[03:02] is well it's it's we're still climbing
[03:06] it's is not so up there Financial
[03:09] ucation is not so up there but it's
[03:11] worse even for women in Africa because
[03:14] even uh access to education for women in
[03:17] Africa is very very limited for women
[03:19] access to education in general so
[03:21] Financial education
[03:23] is well sorry excuse me 1
[03:27] minute uh yeah 1 minute it is that no no
[03:30] worries yeah yeah of course take it take
[03:32] your time sorry about that uh okay all
[03:36] right oh forgive me I'm so sorry about
[03:39] that I should have alerted them that I
[03:41] was in in an interview sorry about that
[03:44] oh no no worries no wor it we are
[03:47] anyways recording it so it's not live
[03:50] okay with that we can always cut cut
[03:53] things out but yeah like um you were I
[03:55] think in the middle of the sentence you
[03:57] you just can you can just
[04:00] we we're still like I said in everything
[04:03] you know Africa is usually behind in
[04:04] everything so it's the same with
[04:06] financial education but we're picking up
[04:08] we we're moving up there yeah
[04:10] interesting uh and and is there a big
[04:12] gap between like men and women also in
[04:14] financial education very a very very
[04:17] very big gap very very you know men are
[04:20] more Curious in Africa here men are
[04:22] allowed to be curious men are allowed to
[04:25] look for explore ideas outside the the
[04:28] norm The General the normal Norms the
[04:30] general Norms so men are allowed to
[04:33] explore more so they able to research
[04:37] more but for women is women are very
[04:40] very restricted when it comes to
[04:42] exploring yeah what do you mean with
[04:44] allowed so they they're not giving the
[04:46] the same access to education no they're
[04:49] not for women in Africa uh access to
[04:52] education access to a lot of things
[04:54] access to banking access to networking
[04:57] access to uh a lot of the social
[05:02] economic systems are very very limited
[05:03] for women in
[05:05] Africa oh man yeah it's I I always ask
[05:09] like that because it's really hard for
[05:11] me to imagine from an Austrian
[05:14] perspective because here um if you're a
[05:17] woman or a man it really does not matter
[05:19] that much you you can study everything
[05:22] you can do everything uh you everyone
[05:24] can have a bank account everyone has
[05:26] access to everything and I know that's
[05:29] different in Africa but it's so hard for
[05:32] me to imagine just because I never saw
[05:35] it like really and I I only hear it from
[05:38] from explanations but I know it is there
[05:41] so it's it's I'm really curious about
[05:44] that like is there like also from law
[05:47] can you not open a bank account is that
[05:49] like a law in
[05:51] Africa well it's first of all it's from
[05:53] the conditioning of the minds of the
[05:56] women it is something that has been
[05:58] trickled down from generation to so the
[06:00] conditioning of the minds of the wom it
[06:02] has been since time Memorial women have
[06:04] been told the place is the kitchen I
[06:06] mean work corate work is for men so you
[06:10] women have to you get married stay in
[06:12] the kitchen you know lots of men had a
[06:14] problem back in the day now it's better
[06:16] but lots of them had a problem back in
[06:18] the day when their wives gave back to
[06:19] women instead of men because they wanted
[06:21] people who would be able to work bring
[06:23] money home and all of that but for women
[06:26] they know they only going to give you a
[06:27] way to someone to marry and that that
[06:30] has been how it has been through history
[06:32] through time and has been trickled down
[06:35] so even though it's getting better it's
[06:38] we're still fighting to ad we're still
[06:40] fighting we're still advocating for the
[06:42] rights of women here especially in
[06:45] financial
[06:46] advocacy financial literacy it's a it's
[06:49] a slow race like it's a long fight the
[06:53] because you basically have to the older
[06:56] Generations kind of have to to die out
[06:58] for the new kind of things and thinking
[07:01] to to come in um is there like a big gap
[07:04] also between uh younger generation and
[07:07] older generation in terms of how they
[07:09] think and how inclusive they
[07:12] are well thankfully thankfully majorly
[07:16] to the internet because of the internet
[07:18] the world has become a small place so
[07:20] most people are seeing how the other
[07:22] people the other side of the world live
[07:23] how the westerners are living they're
[07:25] learning things but back in the day we
[07:27] didn't have that so it was nuring was
[07:29] just from your mother right most fathers
[07:31] were not home to nurture so nurturing
[07:33] was just from your mother so the
[07:34] conditioning of your mother's mind is
[07:36] what she nurtured that is what she
[07:37] trains you with so that is where you
[07:39] grew up with but now because of the
[07:41] internet and because of how small the
[07:42] world has become people are
[07:45] learning the ways of the ad side of the
[07:48] world so people are realizing oh so I
[07:50] can also bank I can also work I can I
[07:54] mean I'm supposed to be have access to
[07:57] some of these some of these
[07:58] infrastructures I'm supposed to be able
[08:00] to start up a business you know and
[08:02] people are learning so people are
[08:04] realizing the women especially are
[08:06] realizing they have rights and they need
[08:08] to fight for their rights how big of a
[08:10] role does the the internet play in that
[08:12] empowerment a
[08:14] lot a lot it does a lot a whole lot so
[08:19] the internet has become I mean is it has
[08:22] become sort of a
[08:25] learning space for lots of people so a
[08:29] lot of people are learning to unlearn
[08:31] what they've been taught and are
[08:33] relearning thanks to the Internet so it
[08:35] has played a huge role a very very huge
[08:39] role yeah I love that and Bitcoin how is
[08:44] Bitcoin uh improving things is that just
[08:47] like for the bank accounts and you then
[08:50] are able to transact it of obviously for
[08:52] inflation and stuff like that but when I
[08:55] usually talk with people in Austria
[08:56] they're like about around the store of
[08:58] value side of it things they want to
[09:00] have an inflation hatch but often hear
[09:03] that uh in countries uh continents like
[09:06] Africa in countries like Ghana or like
[09:08] even like in countries like El Salvador
[09:10] or turkey there's a different story uh
[09:13] to to that where we also talk about Med
[09:15] medium of exchange where we also talk
[09:17] about the whole other side of of Bitcoin
[09:20] like how is how is Bitcoin empowering uh
[09:23] people in
[09:24] Africa uh well aside from inflation uh
[09:29] this is what I wanted to say about
[09:31] Bitcoin in Africa I realized in the
[09:35] western lots of people are thinking
[09:36] about trading and investing just to
[09:40] huddle right but in Africa we are not
[09:43] looking to just huddle because the kind
[09:45] of problems that Bitcoin solves in
[09:47] Africa are massive they change the
[09:50] entire sphere of how things operate in
[09:54] the ecosystem in Africa here for example
[09:57] iide from the the central the is the
[10:00] fact that Bitcoin itself is
[10:01] decentralized so it breaks so many
[10:04] barriers especially with the gender bias
[10:06] Gap with women it basic it breaks so
[10:09] many barers I mean it's decentralized so
[10:13] it means that I don't need permission
[10:14] from anyone to hold Bitcoin right unlike
[10:18] in money where if say I'm a child and
[10:21] say I'm in a child marriage and I need
[10:23] money I'd have to go to my husband's
[10:25] even if even if I do have my own money
[10:27] and I want to spend I'd have I need
[10:29] permission from my husband but with
[10:32] Bitcoin I don't need my husband to sign
[10:35] off off any bank account before I'm able
[10:37] to hold money right so it's
[10:40] decentralized nature in itself
[10:43] is
[10:45] uh what's the word is a good thing it's
[10:49] ital loan is a good thing it's and
[10:53] secondly it facilitates crossb
[10:56] remittances I mean there are lots of
[10:57] people in the diaspora want to send
[10:59] money to their family members here and
[11:03] when you go through the usual system
[11:05] it's very very expensive so you find
[11:08] people not sending as much or not
[11:11] wanting to send as regularly but with
[11:13] Bitcoin it's cheap it's cheap to send
[11:17] remittances from crossb remittances it's
[11:19] cheap to send that it's cheap to make
[11:21] payments like you said inflation it
[11:24] helps against inflation if you have
[11:26] businesses for those who have businesses
[11:28] it if protect it becomes a store of
[11:30] value against the inflation in a Africa
[11:34] here the level of inflation is very very
[11:36] high in two weeks in a span of two weeks
[11:39] you could lose your money by 20% due to
[11:43] inflation right so if I have a business
[11:46] and I'm selling I sell a product for say
[11:50] I'm going to use the Ghana City do you
[11:52] understand the Ghana City so if I sell a
[11:54] product for say 20 cities right and in
[11:57] two weeks it's a slashed by when this it
[11:59] means that I have lost value but if I
[12:02] buy and sell in Bitcoin I don't just
[12:05] even with its volatility I don't just
[12:07] win I don't just sorry make more profits
[12:10] if even if Bitcoin doesn't move right I
[12:13] still maintain the value that at which I
[12:16] bought or sold the product which which
[12:19] is good yeah do you need the approval of
[12:23] your husband to sign a transaction on a
[12:25] bank account well for most for a lot of
[12:30] women especially in uned communities
[12:33] most women especially in under
[12:34] communities do not own bank accounts
[12:36] right their husbands own their
[12:39] accounts yeah it's that's when you go to
[12:43] the urban areas things are changing so
[12:46] women are advocating and women are
[12:49] getting sorry signing up for bank
[12:50] accounts and all of that opening bank
[12:52] accounts on their own but in most rural
[12:54] areas which is where our attention is
[12:56] for Bas initiative it's the challenge is
[12:59] more you most women are on banked they
[13:02] don't have accounts and their husbands
[13:04] are the ones that they need permissions
[13:06] from in order to be able to either
[13:08] remove or their husbands will have to go
[13:09] take money from the bank to give to them
[13:11] before they able to feed their families
[13:13] that's that's huge in in some situations
[13:17] especially when you go to the market
[13:18] there are lots of women who do the hard
[13:20] work I mean you go to the market you see
[13:22] the women selling and buying and all of
[13:23] that but most of them have to give it
[13:26] the money to their husbands in order to
[13:27] save them in the banks for them which is
[13:30] which is very bad which shouldn't be the
[13:33] case wait they they they earn the money
[13:36] they give it to the husband so he can
[13:38] get it to the bank and under his control
[13:41] yes under his
[13:42] control either yes it's either that or
[13:45] for most women they have to hide them
[13:49] and if you not married to a good man and
[13:50] you hide money you know you're in
[13:52] problem you're in trouble if he finds
[13:55] out it's a big issue it's it's almost
[13:58] like uh if you want to be uh if you want
[14:01] to be uh really Sovereign as a woman in
[14:04] Africa you you have to have Bitcoin and
[14:07] you have to have uh the guts to do that
[14:10] it's it's right it's an it's a big story
[14:14] actually like it's it's something really
[14:16] huge that that Bitcoin does for for you
[14:18] and for for women in Africa Bitcoin
[14:22] Bitcoin creates freedom because if I'm a
[14:25] mother right and this is my situation I
[14:28] give to my kids and say I have three
[14:31] kids I have one gentleman one boy and
[14:33] then two girls now if I know about bcoin
[14:37] right and I'm able to teach my children
[14:39] about Bitcoin I'm able to save sell save
[14:42] invest in Bitcoin and I'm able to take
[14:44] my children through school I teach my
[14:46] children Bitcoin once we educate women
[14:49] it trickles down it creates a rle effect
[14:53] for the generations to come so hopefully
[14:55] this whole situation changes and women
[14:58] are in the future free of all this
[15:01] biases and you know they are able to
[15:04] attain Financial Freedom yeah
[15:05] interesting yeah that that that's super
[15:08] super super important and I think um how
[15:12] did you actually get started with
[15:13] Bitcoin how was the journey for you when
[15:16] you first came into Bitcoin uh and how
[15:19] was was kind of your enter in that scene
[15:22] how difficult was it also for for you
[15:24] with uh I don't know if husband and
[15:26] stuff like that if there was any
[15:27] challenges
[15:29] uh well it's a long story but I'm going
[15:31] to I'm going to I'm I'm going to try to
[15:33] make it short I I came from a
[15:34] comfortable home so growing up I didn't
[15:38] really experience
[15:41] the the restrictions that most women
[15:43] experience out there in the world um I
[15:46] mean I went to
[15:47] school uh you you realize that in
[15:50] secondary school you realized you
[15:52] teachers try to put you in trouble so
[15:54] that they can have access to you you go
[15:55] to university and then your lectures
[15:58] want to
[15:59] soorry your lectures want to fail you so
[16:02] that they can take advantage of you I
[16:03] mean I experienced all of that but I
[16:05] didn't think they were that bad until I
[16:08] completed school I completed my
[16:09] University and I was trying to look for
[16:11] a job
[16:13] uh I think 12 and out of all the job
[16:16] interviews that I went I mean some of
[16:18] them will call you back some of them
[16:19] will not call you back 12 of these job
[16:21] 12 not two not three not four 12 of
[16:24] these jobs I got called back on 12 of
[16:26] these job in a particular year in a span
[16:28] of one year say 6 months to 8 months and
[16:33] every single one of these people that
[16:35] called me back had a condition to employ
[16:39] me every single one of these 12
[16:42] companies had a condition to employ me
[16:44] they all wanted something from me they
[16:46] all wanted to take advantage of me and
[16:48] one of them that disgusted me the most
[16:50] was when the CEO had I think he had an
[16:55] appointment letter and said this is the
[16:56] appointment letter this is your name on
[16:58] it you just need my signature and you
[17:00] know what to do I mean I need just one
[17:02] thing and then I'm going to sign it I
[17:04] got so angry and so disgusted that I
[17:06] worked out and after that I for some
[17:09] time I decided you know I'm not going to
[17:11] bother myself to look for job and all of
[17:12] that but I mean you do have to find a
[17:14] living so you do have to look for a job
[17:16] now fast forward to 2018 I lost my home
[17:19] I had some issues at home and of course
[17:22] um my brother was favorit I had to leave
[17:25] the house so with in 2018 with no job no
[17:28] money
[17:29] absolutely nothing to my name I had to I
[17:32] became homeless and then I found myself
[17:35] in a
[17:36] community a very very very underserved
[17:39] Community F forward 2018 2019 there was
[17:42] this initiative by the government they
[17:43] said they called it napco the napple
[17:45] initiative where they employ you but
[17:48] you're not on permanent basis and then
[17:49] they give you a stipping now I said good
[17:52] because I needed a job so I took it up
[17:54] and the stipping was a month in a month
[17:56] the stipping was 700 Ghana cities which
[17:58] is about about $47 in in in US 47 in us
[18:03] so
[18:04] $47 700 cities very very small you could
[18:08] you would have to borrow to for transfer
[18:10] money to be able to make it and at the
[18:12] end of the day when you pay when you're
[18:14] paid and you pay the person back you you
[18:16] get no profit you don't even break even
[18:18] and was difficult but with a vision that
[18:21] I mean in time you're going to be
[18:23] permanently employed and you're going to
[18:25] get some some allowance or some salary
[18:28] was good enough for me so I decided to
[18:30] go through that struggle but the first 3
[18:32] months people were permanently employed
[18:35] now what the reason why they brought to
[18:37] the napco was because they said there
[18:40] were no jobs and so they wanted to train
[18:42] the
[18:43] youth but three months into it people
[18:45] were permanently employed into POS
[18:47] positions that they themselves said were
[18:49] not available and we the ones who were
[18:52] in there had to teach them how to do the
[18:55] job a year later people were permanently
[18:58] employed
[18:59] second year and so I kep asking myself
[19:02] why do we have to teach the people they
[19:03] bring in they earning more than us we're
[19:06] taking just 47 about
[19:09] $47 we have to teach them the job if we
[19:12] are teaching them the job then it means
[19:14] that we are equally qualified to be
[19:16] given permanent employees and be paid
[19:17] right but because they wanted cheap
[19:19] labor they kept people in the UN
[19:21] communities and kept making them poor
[19:24] that is how the system works so they
[19:25] keep making you poorer and then the rich
[19:27] people's children the politicians
[19:29] children are being made permanent they
[19:31] come in we teach them the job they sit
[19:34] in the large courts we do all the job
[19:35] they get paid and we get nothing in
[19:38] right and that's what it was and now
[19:40] after three years the napco regime was
[19:44] cancelled and everyone was asked to go
[19:47] home which means that every single
[19:49] person from the and Community who came
[19:51] in there did free lab they didn't get
[19:53] anything out of it some of them were in
[19:55] depth some marriages broke down because
[19:57] some some people people could not take
[19:59] care of their families so some a lot of
[20:01] marriages broke down people lost their
[20:03] homes because they couldn't pay for
[20:05] bills and now you you be you're
[20:07] canceling the program the program after
[20:09] three years right so there was a lot of
[20:12] bitterness now luckily for me the
[20:14] institution that I was put into we were
[20:16] held we were kept in there of course for
[20:19] the first six months they still gave us
[20:20] the
[20:21] $47 but after that we decided to
[20:23] advocate for better pay and so they
[20:26] increased it for us which is which was a
[20:29] quarter a quarter of what the permanent
[20:31] people were receiving but it was better
[20:32] than
[20:33] $47 so I told myself I can't leave like
[20:36] this this is not how I want my life to
[20:38] be I have been in a comfortable home
[20:40] before so when other people in my
[20:43] community were appreciating it so much
[20:45] it looked like I was being ungrateful
[20:47] but I knew there was more that could be
[20:49] done right so I decided if I could leave
[20:53] on $47 then I can equally leave on this
[20:55] and still start a business so I decided
[20:57] to start a business
[20:59] and the problems with initially the I
[21:03] was trying to get startup capital I went
[21:04] to a couple of banks but your first of
[21:07] all your female there's so much bias in
[21:10] it the fact that you're female um you
[21:14] you you can't you don't have access to
[21:17] um you don't have access to Collateral
[21:19] so you're not going to get it and those
[21:21] who act like they want to help you only
[21:23] want to take advantage of you and not
[21:25] necessarily help you you understand so
[21:28] it was a problem for me but little by
[21:30] little I kept up with a hustle and I
[21:34] reconnected with an old friend of mine
[21:36] we started talking about it I was
[21:37] telling him about the things that i'
[21:39] gone through the problems and all of
[21:41] that and then I told him about my
[21:43] business I told him how how I was
[21:45] struggling in my business then he spoke
[21:47] to me then he said well you can you can
[21:50] start saving in
[21:51] Bitcoin I know I loved it was funny I
[21:55] loved I said what I mean I'd heard about
[21:57] Bitcoin but never thought that I would
[21:59] be in the Bitcoin space because so the
[22:02] first thing I said was what I'm not even
[22:05] Rich enough for that you understand then
[22:07] he said oh no you don't need to be rich
[22:09] enough to do Bitcoin I said no but
[22:11] Bitcoin and at at the time at the time
[22:14] well I I didn't have enough information
[22:16] so I'm pretty sure that's why at the
[22:18] time I thought it was I didn't think it
[22:20] was real currency I thought it was nerd
[22:21] money you know so I said oh no he's a
[22:24] nerd he's into Tech so I said oh come on
[22:28] that is not real money I need real money
[22:30] he said well so he introduced me to it
[22:32] he educated me on it he gave me a couple
[22:34] of links to read about and after I read
[22:37] about it I said you know what it won't
[22:39] it won't take anything from me I'm
[22:40] already struggling so why didn't I try
[22:42] this so I started saving just 5% of my
[22:46] earnings in there so for my business the
[22:49] little that I make I put 5% in there
[22:51] whenever my allowances come I put 5% in
[22:54] there and after a
[22:56] year I realized oh my God my mind was
[23:00] blown I said
[23:02] wow so that was when I began researching
[23:05] I did more research I wanted to
[23:07] understand it how do I make money how do
[23:08] I you know I started researching about
[23:10] it and fast forward to last year um
[23:15] early last year I visited no sorry last
[23:17] two years December it was in 20 2023
[23:20] December so I had moved out of that
[23:23] community and I went to visit a couple
[23:25] of friends that I made in the community
[23:26] they called me I told them I was going
[23:28] to Last by in December so I went there
[23:31] so I got to the community I looked back
[23:33] at it I looked at the experiences that I
[23:35] had had in that community and I cried I
[23:38] cried so much I got home I thought about
[23:41] it so much I asked myself these people
[23:44] thought I was reaching for too much but
[23:46] here I am what if I'm able to pull them
[23:48] also out of that situation right so I
[23:51] called this friend of M the one who
[23:53] introduced me to bitcoin I told him
[23:54] about it we had a couple of discussions
[23:56] and that was when we came up with thisy
[23:59] and so it is for females but most of our
[24:03] attention is going to be on the unders
[24:05] communi so that we can pull them up out
[24:07] of the poverty rate so that is how bit
[24:11] FY came to be interesting wow yeah I I I
[24:15] love that story and there's so many
[24:19] interesting things and uh nuggets in
[24:22] there uh how how Bitcoin is helping and
[24:25] it's it's it's amazing
[24:28] it's kind of it's really sad to see how
[24:31] this this works of the the workers and
[24:34] and how you basically completely uh
[24:38] abused honestly as as a worker um you
[24:44] you you were talking in the beginning of
[24:46] conditions that every
[24:48] employer uh had I don't know if maybe I
[24:51] overheard it but what are those uh what
[24:54] was those conditions um as as a
[24:58] as a spoiled Austrian it's it's always
[25:01] hard to understand because there are so
[25:02] many laws protecting the the workers in
[25:05] Austria that it's uh really hard to
[25:07] imagine like what are the conditions
[25:10] that uh the companies say like oh you
[25:12] you have to do this otherwise you you
[25:14] cannot uh come work for
[25:16] us well for most all of these people
[25:19] were men and for all of them they all
[25:22] wanted sexual favors every single one of
[25:24] them wanted sexual favor so you you
[25:28] called I came for an interview you
[25:30] called me back and you see it tells you
[25:32] that you're not the only person that was
[25:33] called back proba called six s 10 women
[25:37] to see who would give in right and the
[25:39] fact that you give in doesn't
[25:40] necessarily mean you're going to get a
[25:42] job you understand so they called me
[25:45] back and all they wanted was sexual
[25:47] favors so when I refused obviously once
[25:50] I've refused they're going to call the
[25:51] next person and that's what they do now
[25:53] at the end of the day even if you give
[25:55] in and they decide not to give you the
[25:57] job who you going to report it to it's
[25:59] your word against this that is a CEO of
[26:01] a company who going to listen to you
[26:03] right he's going to say you came for a
[26:05] job interview and we didn't pick you up
[26:07] so you're creating stories nobody is
[26:09] going to believe you that is the problem
[26:12] and the saddest part is your own female
[26:14] counterparts the little female
[26:16] representation that we have up there
[26:17] will not even believe you they will talk
[26:19] down on you they're going to ask persons
[26:21] like what were you wearing how did you
[26:22] didn't you try to flex with him you know
[26:24] they make it look like you are so
[26:26] desperate for a job that you probably
[26:28] yourself on him and that's how it's
[26:30] going to be so every single one of them
[26:32] that called me wanted sexual favor and I
[26:35] said no I I went back home
[26:38] unemployed and the funny thing there's a
[26:40] funny story I remember I told my dad
[26:42] kept asking me are you telling me you
[26:44] know back then I had not lost my home so
[26:45] my dad kep asking me are you telling me
[26:47] you didn't pass any of the interviews
[26:49] and then one day I got angry because I
[26:51] didn't want to talk to him about it one
[26:52] day I got angry and I told him this and
[26:53] this is what happened you know the first
[26:55] question he asked me how did you dress
[26:56] when you going how did you dress when
[26:57] you're going so even my own father the
[27:00] first question that comes from his mouth
[27:01] is how did you dress when you're gone so
[27:04] if from your own home this is the
[27:05] question you're asking imagine what
[27:08] other people are going to be asking
[27:10] right so you you being the victim are
[27:13] rather going to be made the villain in
[27:16] this situation that is why most of these
[27:18] people keep doing this to the younger
[27:19] girls because they know that there's no
[27:21] one there to speak out for
[27:23] them oh man that
[27:26] that's wow I'm I'm speechless
[27:30] so it's
[27:31] it's hard to hear it's happening all
[27:35] around even back in the
[27:36] university on two occasions I was filled
[27:39] I studied economics I was filled and I
[27:42] remember I went to the first time I was
[27:45] filled I went to the the the hall to
[27:50] speak to to look for the teacher so I
[27:51] went to the Stafford to speak to the
[27:53] teacher when I to the lecture when I got
[27:54] there I told him he filled me right and
[27:58] then he started laughing because prior
[28:00] to that we had had some encounter from
[28:02] in the classroom and he tried to speak
[28:04] to me and at at the time I mean I didn't
[28:07] know what he was looking for I remember
[28:09] when I was going to write my exams once
[28:11] I had finished the first the first exams
[28:14] and I was going he he came wanted to
[28:16] give me a lift to my hostel and I said
[28:18] oh no you know I'm fine it's just here I
[28:20] just want to walk because I just wrote a
[28:21] paper and he insisted I said no then I
[28:23] walked
[28:25] and when I went to write the Second one
[28:28] I remember I was writing looking on my
[28:30] paper writing then I F someone standing
[28:32] on top of me so I looked up and he just
[28:35] smiled and said okay so now I have your
[28:37] index number then he laughed and left I
[28:40] didn't think any anything of it because
[28:41] I didn't think he was going to keep the
[28:43] index number in his head because we
[28:45] don't use our names we use our index
[28:46] numbers so when he failed me I asked
[28:49] myself what what happened what happened
[28:50] it was until I met with him in the
[28:53] department that was when and when he
[28:54] started talking that I realized oh my
[28:56] God so this gentleman actually kept my
[28:58] number sorry my index number filled me
[29:01] purposely so that I would come to him
[29:02] and he would ask me for he ask me for
[29:04] sexual favors right please someone is
[29:07] trying
[29:08] to oh oh goodness me my daughter is
[29:13] here one minute please is is it okay can
[29:16] I get up I need to yeah no no no worri
[29:18] wor wor I got someone watching her but I
[29:21] think she may have slipped
[29:23] away
[29:25] yeah kids uh kids do that
[29:29] yeah and and to add to it you know I
[29:32] didn't want to talk about this but once
[29:34] she's coming here I'm going to talk
[29:35] about it um before I was going I was I
[29:39] was a single person before I was going
[29:41] but in order to survive I had to live
[29:45] with a man right and that is how I
[29:49] brought for my daughter right so if I
[29:52] hadn't been put in that situation I
[29:54] wouldn't have been so conned that I
[29:56] would have to produce when I was not
[29:58] ready you understand so these are some
[30:00] of the challenges that women go through
[30:02] I was I was not going to talk about it
[30:04] but I mean since she introduced herself
[30:06] I decided okay that's fine I'm going to
[30:08] talk about how she came to the world
[30:11] that's like I was
[30:12] saying so like I was saying um he he
[30:16] wanted sexual favors for me and then I
[30:18] said no it meant that I would have to
[30:20] wait and then redo the paper the next
[30:23] year now the next year sorry uh the next
[30:27] semester when I was doing the E
[30:29] economics e02 Eon
[30:32] eon2 that paper to I failed that paper
[30:35] and I said no this doesn't make sense
[30:37] this lecture is different from the other
[30:38] lecture so why did I fil and so I went
[30:41] to the department to speak to the
[30:42] lecture that the one the lecture that
[30:45] taught us only for me to enter the room
[30:47] to realize that he shared an office with
[30:50] the old lecturer and that is how that is
[30:53] how adamant some of them are so it means
[30:56] that you convince your fellow lectur to
[30:59] fil me just so that I'll come back in
[31:01] there then you can do whatever it is you
[31:03] want to do to me I got so mad and
[31:05] threatened to report him I think that
[31:07] was why he backed down so that I I
[31:10] completed my University but I still had
[31:11] to wait an entire year to reite those
[31:14] two courses before I could graduate but
[31:16] was sad just because I was a woman and
[31:19] some man wanted some sexual favor from
[31:21] me out of nowhere thinking it was his
[31:24] right so some of some these are some of
[31:26] the challenges that we go through as
[31:27] women here yeah I partnered up with coin

[33:46] different world that uh that I live in
[33:49] obviously um and and how big of a a step
[33:54] forward is Bitcoin now for that
[33:58] getting yourself basically a bank in
[34:00] your pocket it's a
[34:03] Lifeline it's it's a life changing
[34:06] Lifeline um right now as I sit here no
[34:09] one can command me on what to do I have
[34:11] my own finances I decide what I want to
[34:14] do I mean and you know the funny thing
[34:18] with African cultures is that once you
[34:20] when you're woman and you go through all
[34:22] these these restrictions and you're able
[34:24] to excel the same family members that
[34:27] let you rot will now come running to you
[34:31] you understand so um so thankfully
[34:35] through Bitcoin I have been able to
[34:37] reconnect with my
[34:38] family I have been able to save enough
[34:41] I've been able to invest enough uh my
[34:43] business is
[34:44] thriving um I I left the job that I was
[34:47] in because of course they didn't want to
[34:49] take they didn't want to pick us as
[34:51] permanent so I had to leave and
[34:52] concentrate fully on my business which
[34:55] is thriving so I'm I'm really doing well
[34:58] yeah Bitcoin has been a game changer for
[35:00] me for me personally and I want to pull
[35:03] other women along because you know in
[35:05] the beginning growing up in a
[35:07] comfortable home I didn't think I was
[35:09] ever going to experience these things
[35:11] but once it's happening around you
[35:13] there's a day that is going to affect
[35:14] you some way some way or the other and
[35:17] it did so I decided now that I'm in this
[35:20] space why don't I pull the other women
[35:22] around me up so that we can all move
[35:24] forward together that no one has to be
[35:26] left behind to go through all that
[35:28] suffering how do you and bit fasi help
[35:32] other women in in Africa like how does
[35:34] this this work well Bey is um it's
[35:39] mainly an educational initiative so what
[35:42] we do is we educate women right on
[35:45] bitcoin and it's and it's um and how it
[35:50] can help them change their lives so we
[35:54] have a couple of
[35:55] programs um we have a couple of programs
[35:58] lined up we we have the Bitcoin for
[36:01] beginners course we have the smart money
[36:03] woman course we have
[36:06] the uh the webinars we have the webinar
[36:09] series that we do we have the Bitcoin
[36:11] coding courses that we do and my my most
[36:14] favorite my most favorite is the
[36:16] community outreach courses the the
[36:18] community outreach that we have that one
[36:21] is like I said it's my favorite that is
[36:24] where we go to the communities right for
[36:27] the other ones you register to join and
[36:30] then we teach you both online and in
[36:32] person but the community with the
[36:34] community AR which we go to the
[36:36] communities then we go discuss with the
[36:38] community members we go there with
[36:39] donations we partner with people who who
[36:42] are willing to donate we go we donate to
[36:44] them and then we teach we have we create
[36:47] a safe space for them to share the
[36:48] experiences ask questions and then we
[36:51] teach them
[36:52] thisen I love I love that a lot it's
[36:55] really really cool um what El some of
[36:57] the challenges that you see that uh come
[37:00] up with educating people on around
[37:02] Bitcoin with uh trying to to help more
[37:05] and more people especially with women
[37:07] are they afraid like what are the
[37:09] challenges that that that you see
[37:11] there well there's a lot of the the
[37:15] major challenge is the skepticism and
[37:17] fear because of
[37:19] misinformation um you know in the
[37:22] beginning when
[37:23] people heard about Bitcoin a lot of them
[37:26] didn't take the time to educate
[37:27] themselves about it so some people
[37:29] rushed to invest without knowing what
[37:32] Bitcoin entails right and some people
[37:34] lost money and so bad information
[37:38] travels faster than good information so
[37:40] because bad news travels fast people
[37:42] kept saying it's a scam and it's a SC
[37:43] it's a SC so you meet women who
[37:47] especially in under communities women
[37:48] who have literally no idea about an any
[37:51] Financial education at all or any they
[37:53] have no financial literacy at all you
[37:55] come to them you're talking to them
[37:57] about
[37:58] Bitcoin and yet they don't even
[38:00] understand the money the Fiat money they
[38:02] holding they don't even understand the
[38:04] what it entails I mean they know it has
[38:06] value because it buys so and so for them
[38:08] it fits their family and all of that but
[38:11] it's the skepticism and the fear because
[38:14] of the misinformation is is Wild is wild
[38:19] so that is why we prioritize uh
[38:21] information sorry education repat
[38:24] education transparency is very important
[38:28] transparency Community creation we've
[38:31] created a community where even after you
[38:32] go through our courses we have a
[38:34] community a safe space where you can
[38:35] come with your problems we can assist
[38:37] you we can link you up to people in that
[38:41] have jobs in those areas it becomes a
[38:44] community where you can rely on for
[38:47] whatever it is you the community of
[38:48] women because we don't have in the
[38:51] natural design of our ecosystem we don't
[38:53] have support systems we don't have
[38:55] mentors this community we've created
[38:58] forms as a as a support system for women
[39:02] that have gone through the Bitcoin you
[39:04] know their Bitcoin
[39:07] training yeah I think role models are
[39:10] super super important to have uh to have
[39:13] someone that you like you can relate to
[39:16] and you see them exceeding and you can
[39:19] basically go and and do that things also
[39:21] like if you if you see someone doing one
[39:25] thing that is that is scary you are more
[39:29] inclined to still do it because it takes
[39:31] courage and someone a role model can
[39:34] give you that courage to like oh like
[39:35] she escaped that she got up there so I
[39:38] can also do it why should I not do it so
[39:40] I think that's that mentorship that role
[39:44] model that uh that that that Vision that
[39:48] uh that that kind of like light of the
[39:50] end of the tunnel it's it's really
[39:53] really important I think for for for
[39:55] people to to get where they they should
[39:58] get and where they they want to get I
[40:01] love
[40:02] that yeah um the the main reason why you
[40:07] know in the beginning when I started
[40:08] beasi the first people I approached were
[40:11] my friends my female friends I told them
[40:12] about it and you know when you've known
[40:15] someone for so long and they bring they
[40:18] try to how do I say they try to start
[40:20] something new you'll be surprised to see
[40:21] that the people around you are rather
[40:23] going to talk you down right so that is
[40:26] what happened this this is what I've
[40:27] discovered and I want my friends to be a
[40:29] part of it I spoke to them about it and
[40:30] they oh you know they're all skeptical I
[40:33] said okay so my you realize that my
[40:36] first cohort was comprised of a lot of
[40:39] strangers all the women in there were
[40:41] all strangers they were not people I
[40:42] knew I put it out there and then people
[40:44] joined women who wanted to learn about
[40:47] Bitcoin join right but in this second
[40:50] cohort they were about to start we
[40:52] starting this this very weekend we
[40:53] starting the second cohort this very
[40:54] weekend this second cohort one after the
[40:57] first cohorts after the people around me
[40:59] saw how how much of a success it was and
[41:02] how it was helping people in their lives
[41:04] now they all want to jum jump on board
[41:06] so yes mentorship is very very important
[41:09] because when you have even when you have
[41:13] been in a space with certain people and
[41:15] you want to try to Mentor them it's it's
[41:18] difficult right we have very little
[41:20] representation up there in decision
[41:22] making roles and so when as a woman you
[41:25] want to take out take it up the same
[41:27] people around you pull you down and that
[41:30] is the reason why a lot of women are not
[41:31] able to reach out there aside from the
[41:33] men that you have to fight to get there
[41:36] the women that you're with that are
[41:37] supposed to pull you up and not pulling
[41:39] you up and that is why I decided I'm not
[41:42] just going to train women after I train
[41:44] women I want to create a community where
[41:46] we can both up we can all uplift each
[41:48] other push people into the decision
[41:50] making space this decision making rules
[41:53] so that they can advocate for policy
[41:55] change and financial inclusion
[41:57] and and that brings me to the Second
[42:01] Challenge you asked me about challenges
[42:03] I spoke about the first one I have only
[42:04] two challenges that is the first one of
[42:06] course the skepticism and the fear
[42:08] because of the the conditioning of the
[42:11] minds of the women through time in time
[42:13] from generation to generation that has
[42:15] been the first one and the second one is
[42:17] funding I mean of course funding limits
[42:20] are ability to scale our educational
[42:23] initiatives and so we're currently
[42:24] working on getting partnership we're
[42:27] exploring sponsorship you know
[42:28] opportunities and all of that so
[42:31] hopefully we do I mean we we this is we
[42:34] started just a couple of months ago it's
[42:36] been 10 months so hopefully we are able
[42:39] to get some Partnerships or some
[42:41] sponsorship and then we can skill our
[42:43] our reach to reach a lot of other women
[42:46] out
[42:47] there I love that yeah you you
[42:50] definitely need uh the support and the
[42:52] thing that you can do that um it it
[42:55] takes a lot of courage takes a lot of uh
[42:58] strength to do all those things to to
[43:00] stand up against that where do you take
[43:02] that from like where where's your
[43:04] motivation uh coming from like what
[43:06] keeps you fighting you know I'm
[43:09] smiling well I Am Naturally a very
[43:12] stubborn
[43:14] woman um I am very naturally very very
[43:17] stubborn I in every space that I have
[43:19] been I have been called controversial
[43:22] not not necessarily in a bad way and I
[43:26] realized that it made my work very even
[43:29] more difficult because the women I'm
[43:31] supposed to look at to get intimidated
[43:33] by me right I speak my mind I I tell it
[43:38] as it is and I do my job and then I go
[43:41] so I have naturally been a very
[43:42] resilient
[43:44] woman but thankfully um I look up to my
[43:49] thankfully I have my mom to thank for
[43:50] that my mom I don't want to tell her
[43:52] story necessarily but my mom
[43:54] has has been through certain things
[43:58] that that has made her very very strong
[44:00] and that is the kind of training that
[44:02] she gave to us in in the beginning when
[44:04] we were younger she was very hard on us
[44:07] I mean she's still very hard but we used
[44:09] to think oh she's wicked oh you know my
[44:12] mom she's wicked this is all the things
[44:14] she's doing she you know all of that but
[44:16] when we grew to a point we realized that
[44:19] because of the way she trained us we're
[44:22] able to go Toe totoe with the men right
[44:25] so my resilience come not just from me
[44:28] but from my upbringing so thankfully my
[44:30] mom I have my mom to thank for that
[44:34] amazing it's it's it's really good to
[44:36] have that that role model again as we as
[44:38] we discussed before and that's that's
[44:40] great uh if it's it's your own mom um
[44:43] really cool I have one question and I
[44:45] think that could be an interesting one
[44:47] that that I ask every one of my guests
[44:49] that in and the question is what can we
[44:52] learn from you besides Bitcoin okay so
[44:56] my life Journey right from being in one
[45:00] space and then tasting how the other
[45:03] side lives their life is is an
[45:06] inspiration to everyone that hears my
[45:08] story I have I'm I'm trying to I'm
[45:11] trying not to get so emotional that is
[45:13] why I haven't gone deep into my story
[45:16] but when you listen to my story in depth
[45:19] you realize that there's so much to take
[45:21] from that right you realize that I I
[45:24] didn't just cut through I mean because
[45:27] for someone like me who didn't grow up
[45:29] with the hardship and all of that I mean
[45:31] usually women who grow up with all of
[45:33] the hardship and all of the problems are
[45:34] the ones that come out resilient so
[45:36] naturally I was supposed to be a softy
[45:39] but because of the training my mom gave
[45:40] me I you know it's it's it's giving me
[45:45] some sort of cushion against the
[45:46] hardness of life so aside from Bitcoin
[45:50] you can take my resilience out of my
[45:53] story you can take the fact that I
[45:56] didn't let the the world Slow Me Down
[45:58] yes I was in a marginalized Community
[46:00] things were not going well I had to miss
[46:02] certain compromises and I ended up
[46:04] giving birth to a child and one thing
[46:06] that did to me was I didn't know this
[46:08] about motherhood um I used to be I used
[46:11] to be a talkative right I was very very
[46:14] in depth I could speak my English was
[46:17] good and all of that but once I
[46:18] delivered I realized I started having I
[46:21] wouldn't say memory loss but I started
[46:23] having concentration problems right so I
[46:26] would read something and it will take
[46:28] longer than the usual to get it to stick
[46:31] and it came as a result of child birth
[46:35] and I have had to work through that now
[46:38] this is if I had taken a b f back in the
[46:40] day it it would have been it would have
[46:42] probably been easier than now because
[46:44] now with this problem that I have I
[46:47] still have to be able to learn be able
[46:49] to focus and then be able to teach
[46:51] people who people in and then Empower
[46:54] them so when I teach the the women I
[46:57] don't just teach them bequin we we teach
[47:00] them resilience we teach them how to
[47:03] maneuver through the problems that
[47:04] they're going through we teach them how
[47:06] to solve real life cases you know most
[47:10] of our educational materials are
[47:12] tailored towards real life problems tell
[47:15] towards each woman's unique problem so
[47:18] once I teach at the end of the day most
[47:20] of my my my educational process is it's
[47:23] interactive and it's engaging so you get
[47:24] to share your story you get to ask
[47:26] questions all of that so we know what is
[47:29] the issue that you have what is your
[47:30] problem how can we solve that problem
[47:33] using Bitcoin right so it's not just
[47:35] about using Bitcoin but like you said if
[47:39] you're a child and you're married into a
[47:41] child marriage right and I mean you're
[47:44] older now of course but you're still
[47:45] controlled by your husband and now you
[47:47] want to do bcoin it takes a lot of guts
[47:49] so we teach you how to maneuver your way
[47:51] through all of these loopholes so that
[47:54] you can financially be free
[47:57] that's so important I think that's the
[47:59] the the mindset behind that and the the
[48:02] the ability to maneuver through the uh
[48:05] through the things is way more important
[48:07] than just like ah like why why why
[48:09] Bitcoin and why do you need it and how
[48:11] do you use it those things you will
[48:13] figure out if if you have the strength
[48:15] and you have the right mindset I I love
[48:17] that approach really cool I have to I
[48:19] have to check out the the program and
[48:22] what you're doing with with FIA close I
[48:24] think that's that's really cool what you
[48:25] you're doing there
[48:27] yeah thank you very much thank you very
[48:29] much um it's been just 10 months but
[48:31] we've been able to reach 600 women
[48:33] because of funding issues I had to hop
[48:35] on Max 24 TV Max 24 TV was going to
[48:39] schools educating schools I think it was
[48:42] they was it was a bre breast cancer
[48:44] Advocate right but I decided to join
[48:48] them and then teach them financial
[48:50] literacy because these were Secondary
[48:52] School people and you have to start
[48:55] small right so I joed Max TV we went to
[48:58] several schools and I I taught a lot of
[49:00] women I was able to pull them into the
[49:02] community so we've been able to reach
[49:04] 600 women not just the people we taught
[49:07] out there but people we've been able to
[49:08] bring in as a community we've been able
[49:10] to raise 600 women my Bitcoin for
[49:13] beginners course we graduated 16
[49:15] graduates graduants this very November
[49:18] 1D November this 2024 and we hopefully
[49:22] we're starting the next one um on
[49:24] Saturday so sorry on Thursday so it's on
[49:28] Thursday and Saturday because most of
[49:30] these people most of these people are M
[49:32] some of them are mother some of them
[49:33] have to work and all of that so we have
[49:35] two times two dates in a week so that
[49:38] they can push their timeline their
[49:39] schedule to fit whichever one that works
[49:42] for them so that's great to hear and 600
[49:46] woman is is extremely impressive like
[49:49] that that takes a lot of a lot of
[49:51] conversations a lot of things uh to that
[49:54] has to happen to to uh facilitate that
[49:58] that many in just like under year that's
[50:00] that's impressive like
[50:02] congratulations thank you and without
[50:05] any outside funding I might
[50:07] add that's even more impressive it's not
[50:10] been an easy Journey but the vision is
[50:14] bigger than the what do I say the vision
[50:17] is bigger than the currency so yeah
[50:20] that's what it's
[50:21] took I love that I I I I think that that
[50:25] episode of ours here is really
[50:27] inspirational for for everyone that is
[50:29] kind of struggling on along the way and
[50:31] and want to push through something I I I
[50:33] love what your story and what you're
[50:35] doing in in Africa um we have a end in
[50:39] the in the podcast where the previous
[50:41] guest is asking a question for the next
[50:42] guest without knowing who the next guest
[50:44] actually is and the question is today
[50:46] for you how can you help your fellow
[50:50] bitcoiners Drive Bitcoin adoption best I
[50:52] think that's a great question for you
[50:55] how can you how can uh you or someone uh
[50:59] help uh other bitcoiners Drive Bitcoin
[51:02] adoption um the best way Bas on adoption
[51:06] oh okay
[51:08] um
[51:11] well the major thing the first thing
[51:13] should be education right I am so
[51:16] adamant on education because that is how
[51:19] people that is the best way to reach
[51:21] people
[51:22] education um and then so you Te You
[51:25] educate people you have to give them
[51:27] real life Solutions right now in Africa
[51:31] here I don't know about the Western
[51:33] World I know the Western World people
[51:34] just like to huddle but in Africa
[51:36] here huddling is not the best way to
[51:39] move forward adoption and using
[51:41] accepting an adoption and using it as a
[51:43] currency is what works here because of
[51:46] the way our system is made so when you
[51:49] give Real Life Solutions why you give
[51:51] real life instances where people have
[51:53] been able to use Bitcoin in their real
[51:56] life situations and you give them
[51:59] scenarios where it has helped them it's
[52:03] it's you are able to people are able to
[52:05] relate more with it and adopt and accept
[52:07] it more than when you just teach them
[52:09] okay this is Bitcoin and it does this
[52:11] and it does that and it does that so
[52:13] yeah of course online campaigns are
[52:15] there you can use online campaigns you
[52:17] can uh use uh daily Solutions you can
[52:23] well like like what we do in B see we
[52:25] tailor it so our educational content to
[52:28] fit the individual specific needs so
[52:31] that drives it more than just talking
[52:34] about Bitcoin and what Bitcoin does
[52:37] right so that is how best I think
[52:41] Bitcoin will be able to drive Bitcoin
[52:43] adoption by teaching people tailoring it
[52:46] to their solution their real life
[52:48] solution and teaching them how bcoin SS
[52:50] can solve their daytoday sorry the
[52:53] day-to-day
[52:55] problems yeah I think that is how
[52:57] Bitcoin can solve adoption can be you
[53:00] know driven absolutely uh that's really
[53:02] cool I like it um perfect then thank you
