[00:00] I do think we are heading to a bigger
[00:01] crisis than 2008 when Bitcoin takes out
[00:04] 73 I I agree with Max's numbers I think
[00:06] we're easily going to be in the high
[00:07] 200s then 6 to 12 months the debt can't
[00:09] grow faster than the GDP eventually the
[00:11] debt becomes unserviceable and we're in
[00:13] that process right now there's going to
[00:14] come another moment that's going to look
[00:16] like March of 2020 what I call the big
[00:18] print the system is broken and the
[00:20] government can never stop printing this
[00:21] we're in the end stages of this you know
[00:23] kyi and Fiat experiment Bitcoin is going
[00:25] to demonetize Gold this is just the
[00:27] internet 2.0 and arguably it's even
[00:29] bigger and more important Because the
[00:30] Internet was dealing with information
[00:31] and communication which is damn
[00:33] important this is dealing with money
[00:35] this is dealing with a base layer the
[00:36] thing that we all need I mean you can
[00:38] live without the internet you can't live
[00:39] without money eventually you come to
[00:41] understand it and you know you end up
[00:43] where you are you have 100% in it you
[00:44] can get these really wide swings on the
[00:47] way to it going to 10 million or it
[00:49] going to kind of infinity in dollar
[00:50] terms because nobody wants a dollar the
[00:52] next three years are going to be really
[00:54] exciting for this space we've really got
[00:55] to get people using it it has to become
[00:57] more of a medium of exchange how the
[00:59] hell they going to attacks us to have
[01:00] the war well then how the hell are they
[01:01] going to have the war that's to me the
[01:03] greatest crime of the fiat currency era
[01:05] that we live in is the way that it's
[01:06] allowed these big corrupt governments to
[01:09] you know go kill people What are nation
[01:11] states for they arose to defend property
[01:13] and they arose to defend wealth they
[01:15] arose to create privilege for the people
[01:17] at the top of them much flatter systems
[01:19] I think would be much better I don't
[01:20] think people fully understand the scale
[01:22] of what happened when the white paper
[01:24] was published
[01:27] [Music]
[01:30] do you think uh uh is a global financial
[01:33] crisis inable is that something that is
[01:36] not anymore not
[01:39] possible yeah that's a great one um I do
[01:42] think we are heading to a bigger crisis
[01:44] than 2008 um I don't know the timing of
[01:47] it nobody does uh you know the the the
[01:52] the issue that we face that I've
[01:53] discussed many times and you're well
[01:55] aware of with all your guesss is that
[01:57] you know the debt can't grow faster than
[01:58] the GDP eventually the debt becomes
[02:00] unserviceable and we're in that process
[02:02] right now and so you know it generally
[02:05] it's going to lead to some kind of a
[02:07] problem um and it can manifest itself in
[02:09] a lot of different ways um but I I think
[02:12] that what's likely to occur is that
[02:15] we're going to have um you know the debt
[02:17] markets are going to are going to get
[02:18] sick and they're going to realize you
[02:20] know this is this is the process of
[02:21] gresham's law right when people realize
[02:23] that they can never stop printing money
[02:25] and the mathematics of the situation
[02:27] suggest that they have to keep printing
[02:28] money to keep the structure the debt
[02:30] structure going they have to keep
[02:31] pushing money into the system they have
[02:32] to have the stock market go up uh and to
[02:35] keep the Bond Market Common if any of
[02:37] those things should change and I suspect
[02:38] that they will the stock market's at a
[02:40] record valuation by any measure US Stock
[02:43] Market um then that would lead to
[02:46] Serious um Financial dislocations which
[02:49] I suppose yeah you could call it a
[02:50] crisis and I think it could arguably I
[02:52] believe it probably can and will be
[02:54] bigger than the 08 crisis but you know
[02:56] you also have many crises I mean 200 um
[02:59] in March of um you know 2023 you had uh
[03:03] you know Silicon Valley Bank blow up and
[03:04] that could have triggered it but it
[03:06] didn't they they put it back in the can
[03:07] they developed a new program they broke
[03:09] the law you know they violated Dodd
[03:11] Frank and um you know and they calmed
[03:14] everything down and so you know I think
[03:16] you're going to see this rolling series
[03:18] of problems um one of which could be so
[03:20] large that they can't calm it
[03:22] down and um and I I then I conclude from
[03:26] that that what that means is that
[03:28] there's going to come another moment
[03:29] that's going to look like March of 2020
[03:31] where you know it's what I call the big
[03:33] print um they are going to be forced to
[03:36] just do everything necessary to keep the
[03:38] system from collapsing um and I think
[03:41] that's in in J Pal's future or if he
[03:43] makes it till March of 2026 you know the
[03:46] next person's F you know future but I
[03:48] think that's coming um if only because
[03:50] of the Relentless you know behavior of
[03:52] the math right I mean that um you know
[03:54] us us interest expense is out of control
[03:57] um you know us debt growth is out of
[03:59] control and uh uh history suggests that
[04:03] these things don't end well I mean there
[04:04] there there are lots of other countries
[04:06] that have done this none of which
[04:08] necessarily had the reserve currency but
[04:10] they you know they did the same kinds of
[04:12] things and it did not end well um you
[04:15] know it's generally a very inflationary
[04:18] event or or there's just an outright
[04:19] collapse so that's longwind to answer
[04:22] your question but yeah that's what I
[04:24] think is
[04:25] coming I don't know when though but but
[04:28] it's not you cannot stop this like even
[04:30] if someone like uh an Aus economics
[04:33] Bitcoin is coming in office as a
[04:35] president they cannot stop this I don't
[04:37] think you can I mean you know you can
[04:39] there's I mean some people say well that
[04:41] sounds very Bleak Larry you know gosh
[04:43] what do we do and um you know there
[04:46] there is I mean look these things these
[04:49] monetary events you know sovereign debt
[04:51] crises which is what this is um have
[04:53] been resolved in lots of different ways
[04:55] you can you can let them run to their
[04:56] end point and have you know
[04:57] hyperinflation or very very high rates
[04:59] of inflation I mean High rates of
[05:00] inflation over and above the existing
[05:02] interest rate might get it done um you
[05:05] know you could you can do a reset I mean
[05:07] Roosevelt did that in the 30s um you
[05:09] know he grabbed the gold reset it at a
[05:11] higher price he effectively devalued the
[05:13] dollar the thing that all the debt was
[05:15] denominated in so you could do that I
[05:17] mean there you know there are structured
[05:19] and fairer ways to do this you know that
[05:22] I think would put us back into a sound
[05:25] system with with more less pain and the
[05:27] pain may be more evenly distributed
[05:29] throughout Society but those would
[05:31] involve you know an intelligent and and
[05:34] um thoughtful leadership you know at the
[05:36] political level and um you know I don't
[05:39] think we have a lot of that right now so
[05:41] my sense is it's just going to continue
[05:43] until it can't continue anymore um you
[05:46] know if if they were to balance the
[05:47] budget um I mean and this would be
[05:49] hugely recessionary and and hugely you
[05:51] know somewhat deflationary but you know
[05:53] the way to the way to keep the system
[05:54] going would be to to you know to balance
[05:56] the budget and try and cut back on
[05:57] expenses but um there it's so far gone
[06:00] that you know if they did that you know
[06:02] the cries would be enormous and there'd
[06:04] be pain there too for just a different
[06:05] set of people so it really you know
[06:09] we've it's kind of like we've been you
[06:10] know we've been drinking and and you
[06:12] know you know we just can't avoid The
[06:13] Hangover I mean somebody's going to take
[06:16] the pain um and it's just a question of
[06:18] who and what's the fairest way to do it
[06:20] and um I don't think the politicians
[06:22] really are even aware of the problem so
[06:24] my sense is it's going to run to its
[06:25] natural conclusion which is extremely
[06:27] high inflation arguably a collapse
[06:30] so is the is um like I'm Al interested
[06:34] also in the in the point of where we
[06:36] know okay we are in in a crisis because
[06:38] a lot of people say oh this is so bad
[06:40] and the other people oh no it's not that
[06:42] bad like when do we know for certain
[06:44] like oh we are right now and in crisis
[06:46] is inflation to one point yeah I think
[06:49] there are a lot of things it's a great
[06:51] question there a lot of what are the
[06:52] metrics you look at I mean so we know
[06:54] something is wrong um you know it
[06:57] because um the price of gold and the
[06:59] price of Bitcoin are are at price of
[07:01] gold at a record high the price of
[07:02] Bitcoin is bumping up against its old
[07:04] record high and I think soon we'll break
[07:05] through it and go down to much higher
[07:07] highs and so these two things are
[07:09] canaries in the coal mine that warn you
[07:11] that the monetary system is sick um you
[07:13] know and and um you know in theory this
[07:16] should not be happening I mean they've
[07:17] diverged from real yields so you know
[07:20] real interest rates you know have gone
[07:22] in the generally speaking when real
[07:23] interest rates you know P push the rate
[07:25] up and and rais real interest rates that
[07:27] should have made golden Bitcoin go down
[07:28] it made them go sideways uh and now you
[07:31] know his he started to ease again
[07:33] they're they're they're strongly going
[07:34] up so um the other thing that's
[07:36] interesting that's happened recently is
[07:37] that the you know he cut the shortterm
[07:39] rates but the long end got away from him
[07:40] or is getting away from him I the tenure
[07:42] yield has gone up substantially since
[07:44] his cut so you know what I what I think
[07:47] all this is is there's a slightly
[07:48] different tone in the markets that is
[07:50] coming to realize what you and I have
[07:53] known what many bitcoiners have known
[07:54] for some time which is that the you know
[07:57] the the system is broken and the the
[07:59] government can never stop printing this
[08:00] is Lynn's fabulous meme you know you
[08:02] can't stop this train right I mean they
[08:05] just it's it's baked in the cake I mean
[08:07] um I mean another dat you know there are
[08:09] all kinds of data points one data points
[08:11] you know US Federal interest expense you
[08:12] know it's up over 1.2 trillion run rate
[08:15] or you know the chart that showed the
[08:17] jump in the US federal debt right after
[08:19] September 30 they closed the quarter and
[08:21] then added between four and 500 billion
[08:23] doar of debt in a in a matter of a week
[08:25] or two I mean you know it's just
[08:27] everywhere you look you see signs that
[08:30] things are breaking and then you know
[08:31] you've got extremely smart investment
[08:33] managers like Paul tutor Jones who's you
[08:35] know self-made billionaire through you
[08:36] know Investment Management saying look
[08:39] you know inflation is the escape valve
[08:40] or inflation is the way out and and
[08:42] that's why I own you know gold
[08:43] Commodities and Bitcoin and you know
[08:46] he's no dummy right so I I think that
[08:49] and but but that he wasn't on TV saying
[08:51] that two years ago I mean he was kind of
[08:52] supporting Bitcoin a couple years ago
[08:53] but and and others are saying it druck
[08:55] and Miller is saying it you know um
[08:57] laran is saying it uh gun un loock is
[08:59] saying it I mean you know even J pal
[09:01] said it J pal said you know this deficit
[09:04] cannot go on forever he's right I was
[09:06] kind of shocked he said it to be frank I
[09:08] got like okay so why are you enabling it
[09:11] but you know something something's got
[09:12] to give right and so that really is the
[09:16] The $64,000 Question what's going to
[09:18] give and when's it going to give and
[09:19] none of us really know but I think what
[09:21] we'll I think what we'll inform us of
[09:23] when it's giving are the prices of the
[09:25] Alternatives I mean you can either
[09:27] decide you're going to hold your savings
[09:28] in in Fiat currencies you know in debt
[09:31] or to some degree in stocks or you can
[09:34] say I'm going to I'm going to step out
[09:35] of that system and and put my savings in
[09:38] something that can't be printed and the
[09:40] three things that naturally come to mind
[09:41] are Bitcoin gold and silver so um and I
[09:44] think what's happening is just more and
[09:46] more people are coming to you know
[09:47] they're choosing box number B okay I'm I
[09:50] get it I know what's going on and
[09:51] they're not going to fix it so I better
[09:52] be over here so you know it could it
[09:55] could get kind of crazy I mean I think
[09:57] when Bitcoin takes out 73 I think this
[09:59] Cy I I agree with Max's numbers I think
[10:01] we're easily going to be in the high
[10:02] 200s you know within six six to 12
[10:04] months so um and I I don't think you
[10:08] know there are a lot of people saying
[10:09] gold is at 30 or 26 2700 now I oh it's
[10:13] going to go back to 2000 it's just you
[10:14] know it's just a spurt it'll come back
[10:15] in and I I strongly disagree I think
[10:18] Gold's going to three or 4,000 on its
[10:19] way to much higher um for a variety of
[10:22] reasons so uh those are the kind of the
[10:24] the signposts that I think uh we should
[10:27] all be watching and the other one is the
[10:28] debt Market Market I mean if if we
[10:30] continue to see the long debt rates you
[10:32] know interest rates go higher um that
[10:34] will mean that there are fewer buyers of
[10:36] the debt and and I suspect you know all
[10:38] this at some point is going to create
[10:40] tight Financial conditions that the
[10:42] Federal Reserve is going to have to
[10:43] create an excuse and react to and you
[10:46] know their reaction will be what they
[10:47] have always done in the past which is
[10:50] they will cut interest rates and they
[10:51] will initiate QE and print money and
[10:55] then if it gets bad enough they'll
[10:56] initiate yield curve control and say we
[10:58] are going to hold these yields at this
[11:00] level and at that point in time anybody
[11:03] in the world who doesn't understand that
[11:05] they can never stop printing you know it
[11:08] will be just completely brain dead at
[11:10] that point in time our stuff is going to
[11:11] go nuts and and and it'll be to me we're
[11:14] in the you know we're in the end stages
[11:16] of you know this great Fiat you know
[11:18] Keynesian Fiat experiment um but these
[11:21] end stages could still take a number of
[11:22] years I don't think this it's not like
[11:24] we're going to hyperbitcoinization next
[11:26] year I mean I think I think we've got a
[11:28] bunch of you know we've got more swings
[11:30] back and forth back and forth back and
[11:31] forth but one can see the long-term
[11:34] Trend and it's pretty clearly in our
[11:35] favor so absolutely and I think it's
[11:38] even um it would be kind of terrifying
[11:41] if we are hyper pitc conization next
[11:43] year that would also mean we have like
[11:45] Mass crisis uh and that's right yeah I
[11:48] mean arguably we want this to kind of go
[11:50] slower over a longer period of time I
[11:52] don't know there there mixed schools of
[11:53] thought on that I mean one is like let's
[11:55] just take the pain and get it over with
[11:56] because the I mean I think I think all
[11:58] bitcoiners would agree that when we get
[11:59] to the other side when we get to the
[12:00] sound money side of the world and they
[12:03] can't they can no longer mess around
[12:04] with us the way they've been doing for
[12:05] so many years the world will be a better
[12:07] place I think I think we all agree on
[12:09] that so one could argue let's just get
[12:11] there no matter what the pain let's get
[12:12] there as quickly as possible the flip of
[12:14] that is now people need time to adjust
[12:16] to the changes so let's take it slower
[12:18] look I mean it's going to take whatever
[12:20] Pace it's going to take and my suspicion
[12:21] is based on looking at other fourth
[12:23] turnings and history that you know this
[12:26] doesn't get really resolved fully
[12:27] resolved until the early 23d
[12:30] which is you know quite some time away
[12:31] but but not you know not lifetimes away
[12:33] it's it's years away but but between
[12:36] here and there you know our stuff's
[12:37] going to work I mean we're on the right
[12:39] side of this right absolutely yeah I
[12:42] love the idea of Bitcoin being kind of
[12:44] the the alarm Bell or the kind of the
[12:46] the the scoreboard of how bad the feeld
[12:48] system actually is
[12:51] yeah coin that term he said it's the
[12:53] only it's the only working fire alarm
[12:55] because they kind of suppress gold was
[12:57] gold used to be the fire alarm but they
[12:59] they really figured out how to suppress
[13:00] that that's a whole that's a different
[13:02] five hour conversation but I mean they
[13:04] learned in the 70s that if if they let
[13:06] gold get away from them it it put a
[13:08] serious damper on people's enthusiasm
[13:10] for Fiat so so they they subsequently
[13:12] put in put in place a number of systems
[13:14] that allowed them to kind of control
[13:16] gold and it's been controlled for years
[13:18] I i' you know the math on that's pretty
[13:20] compelling I lay this out in the book
[13:21] I'm doing um you know if we if we went
[13:24] back to a gold standard like we had in
[13:25] 1971 you took the monetary base you
[13:27] divide it by the ounces of gold the US
[13:29] had gold would have to be at $80,000 an
[13:31] ounce so that it gives you a sense of
[13:33] just how much money has been printed
[13:36] between you know 71 and today right so
[13:39] I'm not suggesting Gold's going there
[13:40] it's not but but what I'm what I'm
[13:42] pointing out is that when we were using
[13:44] gold as the monetary base you know you
[13:46] could take the the monetary base divided
[13:48] by the ounces the US held you know that
[13:49] theoretically backed it and come up with
[13:51] a $35 price you know it's in the 50s and
[13:54] early 60s it started to get away from
[13:56] them as the war ramped up in the 60s but
[13:59] um and that's that's no longer the case
[14:00] I mean we come a long way from that day
[14:02] so a lot of people fear that the same
[14:05] thing is is is happening with with
[14:07] Bitcoin I have a interesting funny story
[14:10] maybe H when I was in Amsterdam I was uh
[14:12] eating a Falafel the day before I came
[14:15] and I had a Bitcoin shirt on and the guy
[14:17] was asking me like hey what what what is
[14:18] this Bitcoin thing uh and he was saying
[14:21] uh one small sentence that I was like
[14:23] that's that's interesting that this the
[14:25] public perception of a no coiner and he
[14:27] said like didn't black is not isn't
[14:29] blackrook not the owner of
[14:32] Bitcoin well yeah I mean it's yeah I
[14:34] mean as stry comes in I mean certainly
[14:36] look my view on the manipulation of
[14:38] Bitcoin is that it's not impossible but
[14:40] I also believe it isn't happening to a
[14:42] large degree and I don't think it's
[14:43] likely a number of reasons that make it
[14:45] better than gold one you can see all the
[14:46] transactions on chain so you see the
[14:48] addresses two um so it's it's it's
[14:51] pretty hard to create paper Bitcoin I
[14:53] mean people have done it I mean Sam
[14:54] bankman freed did it and others have
[14:56] done it and there'll be you know and
[14:57] there are derivatives on it as long as
[14:58] there are derivatives and Futures on it
[15:00] you know that's paper and so you know
[15:02] there there is theoretically if those
[15:03] markets became enormous you if those
[15:05] markets became 100 times the size of the
[15:07] daily trading on chain well that would
[15:09] be a different matter then maybe there'd
[15:11] be manipulation taking place but and by
[15:13] the way that's what's going on in Gold I
[15:14] mean you know the amount of amount of
[15:15] gold that's traded on you know on
[15:17] exchanges on a daily basis is multiples
[15:20] huge multiples of the underlying amount
[15:22] that we mine you know in any given year
[15:24] and so um so there's it's a tail wagon
[15:26] the dog situation but that's not the
[15:28] case in Bitcoin
[15:29] the Futures and options are are mild or
[15:31] small compared to the total outstanding
[15:33] and the total tradeable um you know so
[15:37] the other thing about Bitcoin is I mean
[15:38] gold is easier to manipulate in the
[15:39] sense that you know gold has never gone
[15:41] up 5x in a 12- month period And so you
[15:44] know if you're going to manipulate
[15:45] something you better be sure you have a
[15:46] printing press behind you so that when
[15:48] you get on the wrong side of the trade
[15:49] you can print the money to cover your
[15:51] margin calls right and and that's kind
[15:52] of what I think they did in the various
[15:54] times when they attacked gold because
[15:56] you know they'd attack it and they'd
[15:57] probably get underwater but they could
[15:58] sit there long enough and just they had
[15:59] unlimited printing press and so they
[16:01] could suppress it um you know when
[16:03] something goes up 5x in a year which
[16:05] Bitcoin did you know in the 20 1920 area
[16:08] 20 2019 2020 um you know that creates
[16:11] one hell of a big hole and uh and by the
[16:14] way you don't have you know you don't
[16:15] have a bis you don't have coordinated
[16:17] Central Bank actions how the central
[16:19] banks don't really even understand what
[16:20] Bitcoin is so so while I'm sure they're
[16:22] all sitting there thinking oh [ __ ] you
[16:24] know this is an alarm Bell that we don't
[16:26] want to have going off and and and it's
[16:27] possible they're even thinking how are
[16:29] we going to figure this out how are we
[16:30] going to suppress it I wouldn't doubt me
[16:31] that they've got a working group working
[16:32] on that I think that to think they've
[16:35] actually done it and got it in place and
[16:36] are ready to go with it uh I don't I'm
[16:39] skeptical I don't see I don't believe
[16:41] that's the case so and I don't I don't
[16:43] think they will in the future I think
[16:45] this thing is going to move too quickly
[16:46] and it's going to overwhelm them they
[16:48] had a long time you know to manipulate
[16:50] gold from 71 to president a lot of years
[16:52] and there were a lot of organizations
[16:54] and they knew where it was and it was it
[16:56] was centralized it was in Central Bank
[16:58] vaults I mean they could about what they
[16:59] had etc etc I this is a different animal
[17:01] so I'm not too worried about it but I
[17:04] but I I hear I'm sympathetic to the fear
[17:06] that it you know that it has has and
[17:08] could be manipulated and don't get me
[17:10] wrong I mean there will there will be
[17:11] people who will try to you know trade
[17:14] around it and push it in a certain
[17:16] direction um but my sense is they're
[17:19] going to get they're going to get
[17:20] wrecked you know I mean if you're short
[17:22] Bitcoin right here you know and the god
[17:24] candle arrives if Samson says it's
[17:26] coming I GRE right you know you could
[17:28] get wrecked really quickly and I mean CL
[17:30] Caitlyn thinks that there's a chance
[17:31] that you know some bank will be on the
[17:33] wrong side of the Bitcoin trade and and
[17:34] a g will get wrecked at some point I
[17:37] don't know if she's right but it could
[17:38] happen I mean you you don't want to be
[17:40] short an asset that can go up 100 or
[17:42] 200% in in a matter of months and this
[17:44] thing can do that right so it's it's a
[17:47] different
[17:48] animal it seems like the also what what
[17:51] we have now is the internet and social
[17:53] media and websites where you can make it
[17:55] really transparent if there's like paper
[17:57] Bitcoin you can make like really public
[17:59] if if there's something wrong and I
[18:02] think that's right and you're starting
[18:03] to see even you know like I I really
[18:04] applaud Alex lean and River what they're
[18:06] doing where they're they're allowing you
[18:07] know kind of proof of reserves I mean
[18:09] it's um and one of the things I think is
[18:11] kind of a weakness I think it's a
[18:12] weakness that every so many people are
[18:13] custodia at coinbase I don't trust
[18:15] coinbase um I just and so you know the
[18:19] paper Bitcoin I own it's not a lot it's
[18:21] only in Ira accounts I can't really
[18:23] liberate very easily um I own Fidelity
[18:25] you know Fidelity is one because
[18:27] Fidelity does their own self custody and
[18:28] trust you know Abby Abby Johnson so um
[18:32] you know it's but yeah look this this is
[18:35] a new thing and there are always issues
[18:37] and risks and guess what we are going to
[18:39] probably be surprised I mean I I you
[18:42] know there will be things that we cannot
[18:43] foresee today that will occur that will
[18:45] surprise us but um you know that that's
[18:48] the nature of something that's new I
[18:50] mean I I was involed in the internet way
[18:51] back when and I I I could never foresee
[18:53] what would become of it I mean I you
[18:55] know the fact that Amazon would do what
[18:56] it did or even something like eBay that
[18:58] would just create you know an online you
[19:00] know flea shop flea market I mean I just
[19:03] it it was stunning and and this that'll
[19:05] be the case here too there'll be all
[19:06] kinds of things that will happen that we
[19:07] can't even foresee today but but you
[19:10] know the thing that's underlying it all
[19:11] that the reason why I am so you know
[19:14] bullish on it is I just don't see any
[19:16] evidence that this is slowing down I
[19:18] mean I when people say well it's going
[19:19] to zero or it's not going to work I'm
[19:20] like well show me the evidence I mean
[19:22] what's the you know I I always put it in
[19:24] the terms of um you know Eugene Kleiner
[19:27] was a great met capist said you you are
[19:28] the dogs eating the food the fact of the
[19:30] matter is the dogs are eating the food
[19:32] and and there are more dogs every year
[19:33] and they're going after the same amount
[19:34] of food and guess what you know the
[19:36] price of the food's going up so you know
[19:38] so it's it's a good thing H you also
[19:41] look said before uh Bitcoin gold and
[19:44] silver how do you look at those three uh
[19:46] moving forward if we have actually come
[19:48] to this financial crisis well yeah so so
[19:51] look I mean the what I've always said is
[19:53] I've always said that gold is analog
[19:55] sound money and and Bitcoin is digital
[19:57] sound money and silver is kind of
[19:59] Silver's not even money money anymore I
[20:00] mean it is but it's it's been kind of
[20:02] demonetized by gold you know the silver
[20:04] gold ratio is really you know it's kind
[20:06] of amazing however silver is a very
[20:08] critical metal that's used in a lot of
[20:10] applications so that you know it's got
[20:12] kind of a dual role as somewhat of a
[20:13] monetary metal but also an important
[20:15] industrial metal for solar and
[20:18] electronics um you know look gold
[20:22] Silver's I mean um Bitcoin is going to
[20:23] demonetize Gold that's that's just a
[20:25] fact in my opinion um you know it will
[20:27] flip gold and will you know gold will go
[20:29] down to its its jewelry value and and
[20:31] and so you know a lot of the premium
[20:33] will come out of it but I caution people
[20:35] to say not tomorrow you know that this
[20:39] is a multi-year arguably multi- deade
[20:42] decade process um of of that taking
[20:45] place and and you know in the in the
[20:48] scheme of things you know gold and
[20:49] silver are still way way better than
[20:52] Fiat um you know in in the environment
[20:54] that we're currently in and so um you
[20:56] know 8 billion people kind of in
[20:58] intrinsically understand that Gold's
[20:59] money because we've had 5,000 years to
[21:01] prove it um you know as we know the
[21:03] number of us who understand that Bitcoin
[21:05] is money it's a much smaller number and
[21:06] it's growing rapidly that's why Bitcoin
[21:08] is going to outperform but um you know
[21:10] it's going to take a long time until it
[21:12] syns into everybody that this is the
[21:13] base layer of the monetary system but I
[21:15] think it will I I think certainly within
[21:17] 20 years it will um but you know 20
[21:20] years is a long time so um but I you
[21:23] know I I think of them in terms of and
[21:25] when I recommend investors to investment
[21:26] to my clients I look you should hold all
[21:28] three um and the waiting should be based
[21:31] upon your your tolerance for you know
[21:34] volatility um and your tolerance for
[21:36] risk and um you know because while
[21:39] Bitcoin is clearly going to be the
[21:40] highest performing it's also the most
[21:41] volatile so you know for somebody who's
[21:43] 80 years old to have 100% of the money
[21:44] in Bitcoin be able to watch it maybe go
[21:46] down 50% well that's scary they don't
[21:47] want to do that um but they but you
[21:49] don't need to have all your money in
[21:50] Bitcoin you know if it does what we
[21:52] think it's going to do you know just
[21:54] having 10 or 20 or 30% of your money in
[21:56] Bitcoin is going to be an enormous win
[21:59] and so you know um everyone can make
[22:01] their own choices I mean sure if I were
[22:03] 30 I'd have all my money in Bitcoin I
[22:05] mean I think most 30 years 30-y olds
[22:07] should but um but that's you know
[22:09] obvious everyone makes their own
[22:12] choices I sometimes feel privileged that
[22:14] um since 23 actually completely all in
[22:16] Bitcoin I adopted this Bitcoin standard
[22:19] and it was possible because I was young
[22:21] I didn't had a family didn't had a
[22:22] company or anything like that and you're
[22:24] gonna do great with that I mean that's a
[22:25] that's a great strategy I mean yeah
[22:27] absolutely um I just remembered when you
[22:30] talked uh also with the early 2030s as
[22:32] you mentioned before uh about the madira
[22:35] presentation Michael saor gave with the
[22:37] 10year gold rush uh that's coming to
[22:40] bitcoin is is is there something that
[22:42] that you think that yeah that really
[22:43] resonated with me I mean he obviously
[22:45] because he used my term gold but that
[22:47] did really resonate with me I mean I
[22:48] think we're at the you know we're kind
[22:49] of at that Malcolm Gladwell Tipping
[22:51] Point where it feels like this is really
[22:54] starting to catch on I mean and there
[22:56] are a number of things I think he
[22:58] pointed to and I would just emphasize
[22:59] them I mean the adoption of the ETF
[23:01] right I mean before that happened most
[23:03] people in the United States a lot of my
[23:05] friends oh yeah that's all great but you
[23:06] know the government's going to kill that
[23:07] lry they're just never going to let that
[23:08] happen well then the ETF got approved
[23:10] and it's kind like okay that's different
[23:13] right and then and then some big wall
[23:16] street names flipping in our Direction I
[23:18] mean I'm not a big fan of Larry f
[23:20] because I think he benefited unfairly
[23:21] from the Fiat system but he's not a fool
[23:24] and um he looked at it did the analysis
[23:27] and came to the conclusion well I've
[23:28] either got to you know join this thing
[23:30] or or be wrong and he decided to join um
[23:34] you know and so he now he now believes
[23:36] and and I I think that's just that's the
[23:38] process that takes place with any kind
[23:39] of a new innovation there's initial
[23:41] skepticism um for you know for for some
[23:44] very legitimate reasons and then as the
[23:46] skepticism is overcome you see more and
[23:48] more adoption and then you know 10 or 15
[23:50] years from now I mean my kids you know
[23:52] you when you're older a lot of other
[23:53] people be it'll just be self-evident
[23:55] like of course this thing was going to
[23:56] work and and um you know I had the same
[24:00] thing in the internet I mean I yeah okay
[24:02] you can hook these computers up you can
[24:03] send emails who cares who wants to do
[24:04] that it's not really that important a
[24:06] thing you know Krugman says a fact
[24:08] machine well well yeah okay but yes
[24:11] you're right it's a little slow and you
[24:12] got to dial up now and it's annoying but
[24:14] guess what it's going to get better and
[24:17] you know I mean here we are X number of
[24:19] years later and you and I are talking
[24:21] Halfway Around The World from one
[24:22] another in real time video conferencing
[24:23] something that used to be extremely
[24:25] expensive I mean the the you know the
[24:27] the implications of the technology and
[24:29] how it's changing our world I mean you
[24:30] just can't ignore these things and to me
[24:34] this is just you know this is just the
[24:36] internet 2.0 I mean and arguably it's
[24:38] even bigger and more important because
[24:39] the internet was dealing with
[24:41] information and communication which is
[24:42] damn important this is dealing with
[24:44] money this is dealing with a base layer
[24:47] the thing that we all need I mean you
[24:49] can live without the internet I mean
[24:50] theoretically you you know you kind of
[24:52] can't live without money uh you can't
[24:54] feed yourself so um so it's a big deal
[24:56] and it's coming so you know yeah I I you
[25:01] know to me it's it's um it's just
[25:03] inevitable and and so the fun part is we
[25:05] get to sit back and you know we get it
[25:07] and we get to sit back and kind of enjoy
[25:08] the ride and then I think our job is to
[25:11] try to save as many people as we can and
[25:12] to try and help and educate others so
[25:14] that when these changes occur you know
[25:17] they they they're on the right side of
[25:19] them I mean I I feel really sorry for
[25:21] people that don't understand this and
[25:22] for people that are trapped in Fiat land
[25:24] because I think that you know
[25:25] economically they're not going to
[25:27] they're going to suffer on a Rel ative
[25:28] basis and and they don't need to if they
[25:30] were to open up their mind and read and
[25:32] read safe's book you know it's it's hard
[25:34] once you once you've actually taken the
[25:35] time to do the analysis it's it's very
[25:37] difficult to come to any other
[25:38] conclusion which is why when I start
[25:40] orange pilling people I'm always just
[25:42] I'm just patient and I'm like no I just
[25:44] keep chipping away at it I've had a lot
[25:46] of people who were very skeptical in the
[25:47] beginning who are now full-fledged
[25:50] bitcoiners but they but it didn't
[25:52] happened in a day you know it took time
[25:54] and and that's how it's going to be with
[25:55] Society right I mean as I said earlier
[25:57] it's this Tipping Point thing so back to
[25:59] Sailors you know this is the Gold Rush
[26:01] yes I think this is the gold rush I
[26:02] think we're in the time frame where this
[26:04] goes from just being a fringe crank you
[26:07] know group of what they call Psychopaths
[26:10] right to to you know oh my god of course
[26:14] I've got some Bitcoin everybody does
[26:15] don't you yeah that's a that's a good
[26:17] that's a good performing asset and it's
[26:19] hedging against the future I should I
[26:20] have some of that you know and maybe
[26:22] it's not very much everyone starts off
[26:24] small but you know eventually you come
[26:26] to understand it and you know you end up
[26:28] where you are you have 100% in it
[26:31] so right and I even came down for 120
[26:35] because I was don't use leverage
[26:37] Leverage is dangerous in this asset I
[26:39] mean I I was around I mean I saw Plan B
[26:41] get all these guys blown out of it you
[26:43] know a couple years back when he was
[26:44] like oh it's going to 150 instantly and
[26:46] I was like uh oh guys levered up and
[26:49] then boom they were you know they wa
[26:50] they lost their
[26:51] corn yeah
[26:54] yeah I mean and that's actually that's
[26:56] something I always try to point out to
[26:57] people too when somebody buying it you
[26:59] know I mean I think it's I think we do
[27:00] someone a disservice oh just buy it you
[27:02] know don't worry well if they buy it and
[27:04] then it goes down and then they freak
[27:05] out and then they sell it well then
[27:06] you've done them a disservice so I think
[27:08] whenever you orange pill somebody it's
[27:10] extremely important to make them aware
[27:12] of the fact that if it goes down that's
[27:14] a buying opportunity not they're not
[27:16] wrong you know because um because I've
[27:19] seen that happen and it's it's
[27:20] unfortunate when it happens right the
[27:22] time Horizon also is really important
[27:24] that it's having a long time yeah a Time
[27:27] preference that you can be patient right
[27:29] absolutely um which is interesting
[27:32] volatility do you think that um when we
[27:35] have like we are like how many percent
[27:38] of the world is in Bitcoin not a lot
[27:40] very very slow small number um and this
[27:43] actual Gold Rush is coming do you think
[27:46] then there's a chance that volatility
[27:47] actually goes up oh no not well uh
[27:52] that's a great question two I'll give
[27:53] you a two-part answer I think in general
[27:55] volatility is trending down from from
[27:57] inception I if you go back and you look
[27:58] at the draw Downs they're getting
[27:59] smaller not not incredibly quickly but
[28:01] they are getting smaller so I think the
[28:04] volatility will decrease on a you know
[28:06] General basis over time because it just
[28:08] gets more widely distributed so they're
[28:09] more buyers to buy the dip um I think it
[28:13] could be extremely volatile in a um you
[28:16] know kind of a Yar like environment um
[28:20] if if we really do break the monetary
[28:22] system and things start to go crazy um
[28:26] you know it could be all all over the
[28:28] map and you know it'll literally be just
[28:32] kind of hang on to your hats because you
[28:34] know it's it's going I mean in other
[28:36] words I don't know are you familiar with
[28:38] it have you seen the chart on um on
[28:39] Twitter that I put many times others
[28:41] have it's Dan Oliver's chart from meran
[28:43] capital of the the the behavior of the
[28:46] Yar of the Yar um Mark against the
[28:48] dollar or I mean against gold during the
[28:50] Yar uh thing you know we should find it
[28:54] and put it in the show notes okay I I'll
[28:56] I'll send it to you we put it in show
[28:58] notes but the the bottom line is that
[29:00] even though the deuts Mark was going to
[29:03] zero against gold there were months
[29:06] where gold did very poorly compared to
[29:09] the deuts mark in other words it was a
[29:11] very volatile process of you know big
[29:14] swings of ups and downs and ups and
[29:16] downs all trending toward the failure of
[29:19] the deutschmark where it took x billion
[29:21] deuts marks you know they were worthless
[29:23] right but but on any you know just in
[29:25] one given month you know I mean and and
[29:28] read the history of the period there
[29:29] were times when the German government
[29:30] would come out and say something along
[29:31] the lines of no no no we're going to
[29:33] stop printing we're going to raise
[29:33] interest you know everything's going to
[29:35] be okay and bingo that you know gold
[29:37] would fall and the deuts mark would
[29:38] rally but of course then they wouldn't
[29:40] do what they said they were going to do
[29:41] and the next month it would go in the
[29:42] other direction and so so the point I'm
[29:44] trying to make is I mean I mean here's
[29:46] an example Rob what you know if if the
[29:48] dollar really starts the fail and
[29:49] Bitcoin goes to
[29:51] 500,000 and then the government
[29:52] announces some program with no no we're
[29:54] going to cut expense we're g do and
[29:56] everyone oh [ __ ] and they believe them
[29:58] um you know Bitcoin could go from
[30:00] 500,000 back down to 200,000 right and
[30:02] that's that's a hell of a lot of
[30:04] volatility um and but then everyone you
[30:06] know at the 200,000 it becomes clear
[30:09] that what the government said really
[30:10] isn't true and they can't do it and so
[30:11] it goes from 200,000 to
[30:13] 800,000 you follow what I'm saying in
[30:15] other words you can get these you can
[30:16] get these really wide swings on the way
[30:19] to it going to 10 million or it going to
[30:21] kind of infinity in dollar terms because
[30:23] nobody wants a dollar anymore you know
[30:25] so so that's that's kind of what I'm
[30:27] descri driving I mean actually you know
[30:29] the process of hyperbitcoinization when
[30:31] the currency failed and in the case of
[30:33] Weimar you know it kind of went up a lot
[30:36] in 19 and 20 and 21 and it was about a
[30:38] one and a half year event where it just
[30:41] the currency completely failed totally
[30:43] and completely failed and so and there
[30:45] was a lot of volatility in that time
[30:46] frame I partnered up with coin vigilante
[30:51] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[30:54] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[30:57] look at that Beauty I love it so much
[30:59] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[31:02] watch that's the perfect subtle elegant
[31:05] way to go out there and show that you
[31:08] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:11] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:14] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:17] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:19] collections you have the date of the
[31:22] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:25] and of course also the block height and
[31:28] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[31:31] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:34] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:36] those amazing coin vilante time pieces
[31:39] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:42] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:45] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:47] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:49] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[31:52] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[31:55] in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:57] commentation for hardare wallet is the
[31:59] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[32:02] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:04] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:07] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:11] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:13] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:17] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:19] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:22] individual you have to have the most
[32:24] secure self custody setup you have to
[32:27] secure your own devices you have to
[32:30] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:32] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:35] where you live you even want to have a
[32:37] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:40] in case something goes really really
[32:42] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:44] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:47] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin

[32:50] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[32:54] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:57] level up your
[33:00] sovereignty I think I think it's also
[33:02] interesting when we look at volatility
[33:04] versus the feed currencies versus
[33:06] volatility of actual purchasing power
[33:09] how does this look in in in such a
[33:11] scenario when we have like
[33:13] hyperinflation yeah well that's right I
[33:15] mean it you know it gets tricky because
[33:17] do you know do you measure things in
[33:18] dollars anymore I mean you know we all
[33:21] often joke that maybe Bitcoin will be
[33:22] worth a million dollars a coin true but
[33:24] gasoline could be $1100 a gallon you
[33:26] know I mean so it it it's you know you
[33:29] you've got I mean at the end of the day
[33:31] all these all these prices just
[33:33] represent what what can you then
[33:34] exchange it for you know what is a
[33:35] gallon or a liter of gas cost you know
[33:38] what is a pound of steak cost um talking
[33:40] about the internet we talked aot a
[33:43] little bit before and you see it kind of
[33:45] the internet 2.0 um where would you say
[33:49] we are in Internet year of adoption like
[33:52] a great question yeah I heard somebody
[33:54] else the other day say it was about
[33:56] 2,000 so I was involved I started buying
[33:58] internet companies privately in
[34:00] 1993 um 95 was when Netscape came out
[34:05] with a browser and most people didn't
[34:06] have Windows then when you when you
[34:07] first got on the internet 93 94 it was
[34:09] green screen um and windows was really
[34:11] kind of shitty in '95 and it got the
[34:14] difference between 95 and 2000 I mean at
[34:17] 2000 that's kind of when I kind of
[34:18] marked the first real widespread
[34:21] adoption of the internet and I just did
[34:22] wrote this in my book 2000 interesting
[34:24] in the United States only about half the
[34:26] people uh in the country in the United
[34:27] States states were on the internet in
[34:29] 2000 so um so we're not at 2000 yet
[34:32] because I don't think half the country
[34:33] is familiar with or on you know uh
[34:36] involved in Bitcoin um but we're not at
[34:38] 93 we're Beyond 93 where it's you know
[34:41] because it's it's pretty you know it's
[34:43] pretty well known now right I mean you
[34:44] see it on CNBC you see you know we've
[34:47] got ETFs we've got Larry Frink buying it
[34:49] we've got billionaires talking about it
[34:51] etc etc so I don't know I I guess I'd
[34:54] have to say we're maybe in 96 or seven
[34:57] um you know and and I think and that's
[35:00] why I think sailor used the Gold Rush
[35:02] comment because 97 is only you know 2000
[35:05] you know everybody knew about the
[35:06] internet you know even if you weren't on
[35:08] it you were aware of it um and so you
[35:11] know I that's why I think the next three
[35:13] years are going to be really exciting
[35:15] for this space because because I think
[35:17] what's going to happen is the monetary
[35:19] stuff's going to get worse you know
[35:21] that's almost a certainty whether we get
[35:23] to the the big print or not I don't know
[35:25] but um but the monetary conditions are
[35:28] going to get worse and um and bitcoin's
[35:31] going to break out from the 73 and every
[35:33] time you know every time it hits a high
[35:35] and goes down and when it went from 73
[35:37] to 25 you know bitcoin's dead it's never
[35:39] going to work all the Skeptics Etc but
[35:42] every time it takes out an old all-time
[35:43] high and everybody's in a profit
[35:45] position it's like oh my God here we go
[35:47] again you know and so when we take out
[35:50] 73 and we head towards you know I I'd
[35:53] say the peak of this next cycle might be
[35:55] 200 250 you know there just going to be
[35:58] a whole new group of converts who are
[35:59] going to go oh [ __ ] you know I was wrong
[36:01] I got to get in on this and of course
[36:03] sadly some of them will buy in at 250
[36:05] right before it corrects down to 150 you
[36:08] know and um you know that's that's
[36:10] what'll happen yeah so so I'd say we're
[36:12] in 97 and I that's why I think the next
[36:15] three years will be very exciting um one
[36:17] one interesting chat that I saw today
[36:19] was uh the Google Trends versus the the
[36:22] Google the the Bitcoin price and you
[36:24] kind of see the the correlation usually
[36:25] a little bit uh but right now with at
[36:28] this like still low in the in the Google
[36:30] Trends like almost nobody seems to
[36:32] search it but we at almost an Autumn
[36:34] high of Bitcoin is that all
[36:36] institutional ETF money companies buying
[36:39] it and the retail still completely
[36:41] asleep I think that's probably right I
[36:44] mean I I I don't know I mean I'm not I'm
[36:47] not really sure why it's kind of so
[36:48] quiet the way it is right now it's kind
[36:50] of surprising to me because it should be
[36:52] higher it should you know it's obvious
[36:54] to me that it should be higher but but I
[36:56] suspect that you know there's still a
[36:58] big piece of the world that thinks the
[36:59] stock market is the place to have your
[37:01] money and that's that's the next piece
[37:03] of money that we need to grab I mean the
[37:05] gold guys aren't going to come byy
[37:06] Bitcoin although some have but the real
[37:08] the real big pool the two big pools of
[37:10] capital in the world are people who are
[37:11] invested in bonds and I think they're
[37:13] slowly waking up to the fact that
[37:14] inflation is persistent but also people
[37:17] who are invested in stocks because
[37:18] frankly stocks have been a pretty good
[37:19] hedge against inflation I mean if you've
[37:20] been in the right stocks you know
[37:22] they've gone up nicely you know over
[37:24] time and they protected you and buying
[37:25] the dip always made sense um I I think
[37:28] that's going to change I think that's
[37:30] subtly changing because I think
[37:32] inflationary conditions um mean that
[37:34] stocks and companies have earnings
[37:36] pressure um they get Rising costs and
[37:39] they can't always pass them pass it on
[37:40] in higher prices so so I guess my view
[37:44] is um you know that the stock market is
[37:47] going to start coming after Bitcoin and
[37:49] that's going to fuel the next leg higher
[37:52] um and you know it's as as you and I
[37:54] both know there's kind of a ceiling
[37:56] right at the old alltime high around 73
[37:58] we're right up against it and the way
[38:00] these things technically the way
[38:01] financial markets tend to work is when
[38:03] you break through an old all-time high
[38:04] you squired up to a much higher all-time
[38:06] high so I think I think clearing 73 I
[38:09] mean I think we'll be at 90 very quickly
[38:11] so um yeah I mean that's my guess but uh
[38:15] but we're not quite through 73 yet and
[38:17] it could take a little bit longer also
[38:19] you know we need we need the government
[38:22] to um start to initiate that big print I
[38:26] mean and and give us more hints that
[38:28] that's coming we're kind of seeing it I
[38:29] mean yesterday Yellen talked about
[38:31] buying some more paper and um you know
[38:34] they they're there are indications that
[38:36] it's going to have to happen um but you
[38:39] know but they're subtle and and and so
[38:42] not everyone's picked up on it yet
[38:44] absolutely yeah what do you think is the
[38:47] the biggest challenge that that Bitcoin
[38:48] kind of faces moving forward um well so
[38:52] there are two we haven't talked about
[38:53] this but there are two kind of use cases
[38:55] surrounding Bitcoin right there's the
[38:57] store of value use case which we all get
[38:59] and understand and really that's I think
[39:00] why most people are in it today and then
[39:01] there's the medium of exchange use case
[39:03] which excuse me Jeff Booth points out he
[39:06] thinks that's the most important one and
[39:08] I I share his View and that we we've
[39:10] really got to get people using it um it
[39:13] has to become more of a medium of
[39:15] exchange and um you know and the reason
[39:18] for that is that that will embed it
[39:20] deeper into society it'll make it harder
[39:22] for you know the governments to 6102 it
[39:26] um you know the medium of exchange case
[39:29] is dependent in my view right now on the
[39:31] development of lightning and you know
[39:34] non- custody Solutions like fedt um you
[39:37] know both of which are being developed
[39:38] and growing and doing quite well and and
[39:40] advancing but um neither of which are
[39:43] you know huge and widespread I mean
[39:45] they're they're really early days
[39:46] they're like the 93 internet and so so
[39:50] we've gota you know we've got to improve
[39:51] I mean right now if you want to send a
[39:52] small transaction over lightning no
[39:54] problem works great cheap you know all
[39:57] squared away you want to send a bigger
[39:59] number over lightning well there's not
[40:00] as much liquidity there you know there
[40:02] aren't enough channels to necessarily do
[40:03] it it's getting better but it's an issue
[40:06] and so so to me these kind of medium of
[40:09] exchange second layer apps and
[40:12] development are the key to much more
[40:15] widespread adoption as quote unquote
[40:17] money um right now in my view and I know
[40:20] s doesn't like when I say this but I
[40:22] strongly right now Bitcoin is really
[40:23] just digital gold you know it it's just
[40:26] it's it's and it's better than gold
[40:27] obviously because it's got a fixed
[40:29] Supply but you know the supply of gold
[40:31] on the planet will double in the next 50
[40:32] years as we mine more of it um so you
[40:37] know the the the um the medium of
[40:40] exchange case is I think what drives us
[40:42] to that next level and and I think
[40:43] that's you know that's another five to
[40:45] 10 years as you know but I think I think
[40:47] more and more I mean I'm sure you've
[40:49] traveled and spent and used M Used
[40:50] Bitcoin for things I have I've been to
[40:52] places that accept Bitcoin I use it
[40:54] every time I can so it's it's coming but
[40:56] it's it's you know that we're in the
[40:58] dialup phase over there you know it's
[41:01] really early days you know what I what
[41:04] I'm saying dialup phase right yeah they
[41:07] kind of start up start up face yeah no
[41:11] I'll be more explicit before we had
[41:12] Broadband when I probably before you
[41:14] were born um back in this the 90s if you
[41:17] wanted to get online you had to take
[41:18] your telephone and put it in a modem and
[41:21] the modem the modem and then you dial a
[41:23] number and you heard this and and your
[41:26] telephone would mate with you know the
[41:29] the receiving end at the other side and
[41:31] and that was how you got your internet
[41:32] connection I mean you didn't have
[41:33] Broadband didn't exist cable TV you know
[41:36] existed but they didn't they had put
[41:37] Broadband signal over it so um yeah no
[41:40] that's that's the dialup phase those
[41:42] were the really early days I mean it
[41:43] started off at 1,200 bot which I can
[41:45] assure you was extremely slow I mean
[41:47] just sending texts took forever so um I
[41:51] I I was born in 98 so when I got the
[41:55] first computer I already had Google
[41:57] there I already like a nice interface
[42:00] there uh the only thing that was still
[42:03] with me was the the fear of your inter
[42:06] your phone being connected to the
[42:08] internet because this charges a Big
[42:10] Bill that was my feel yeah back way back
[42:13] when and that was before you guys said
[42:14] Broadband too yeah Broadband made a big
[42:16] difference I mean you know each of these
[42:18] developments just just pushed us down
[42:19] the road and they just keep on coming
[42:20] and that's the beautiful thing about
[42:22] technology I mean one things I say and I
[42:24] talk about this a lot in the book what's
[42:25] going to save us here is technology I
[42:27] mean we built this big centralized world
[42:28] with a bunch of bad people controlling
[42:30] it and they've stolen from us and they
[42:32] they've set up a system to benefit
[42:34] themselves at our expense and um you
[42:37] know technology is going to save us you
[42:39] know we've got we've got the internet
[42:41] you know the New York Times can't tell
[42:42] me what to think anymore I can listen to
[42:44] Joe Rogan you know and um um you know so
[42:47] the internet gave us Freedom of
[42:49] Information and freedom of speech and
[42:51] connected us all together and and
[42:53] allowed you and I to do things like
[42:54] we're doing right now and then Bitcoin
[42:56] is going to give us money that can't be
[42:58] debased and so a combination of the two
[43:01] you know these old sclerotic corrupt you
[43:03] know centralized government Powers you
[43:06] know they're all going to
[43:09] die I'm really excited about
[43:11] that so I love you you said I think in
[43:16] the beginning the first like 10 15
[43:17] minutes something uh with like we can't
[43:20] even imagine what what what's there to
[43:22] come something along those lines and
[43:24] it's really interesting when we have all
[43:26] those those uh small use cases on top of
[43:29] Bitcoin with like value for value for
[43:31] Nostra Layer Two Solutions fent
[43:34] lightning as you mentioned um what are
[43:36] your uh maybe besides the the the the
[43:40] just payment rails most excited about do
[43:42] you see nostr do you see uh like I love
[43:45] Noster I mean I you know hopefully um El
[43:48] will keep Twitter free and you know um
[43:51] but but yeah look I'm not I'm probably
[43:54] not the best person to ask on that
[43:56] because I I focus more on the monetary
[43:57] side but I I think I think the monetary
[43:59] side's just enough and actually I'll
[44:01] tell you what I'm most excited about um
[44:03] I'm excited about really two things
[44:04] about Bitcoin really one I'm excited
[44:06] about what Alex gladstein work and um
[44:10] and how much it can help the unbanked
[44:11] and the third world and um you know a
[44:14] lot of people who are just you know
[44:16] taken advantage of Left Right and Center
[44:18] by the financial system I mean there
[44:20] four billion people that that aren't
[44:22] really in First World countries that you
[44:24] know kind of get screwed with respect to
[44:26] their money and and bit can can help
[44:27] them and has helped them and you know
[44:29] the remittance business is a huge
[44:31] business a you know $68 billion doll
[44:32] year business and um you know that
[44:34] somebody's raking off 10% on the
[44:36] transaction fees there and it could be
[44:38] zero if it were all enlightening um the
[44:40] other thing I'm very excited about is
[44:42] that I think Bitcoin will defund
[44:44] government and then therefore make it
[44:46] much harder to conduct War um and I you
[44:49] know the I don't think there's any set
[44:51] of human beings that would you know vote
[44:53] to have to pay the taxes necessary to go
[44:55] kill other human beings and so the
[44:57] governments have figured this out and
[44:58] that's the way they pay for these wars
[45:00] is they just have inflation and if you
[45:02] take inflation away and you can't have
[45:03] inflation because the monetary system
[45:05] cannot be inflated full stop well how
[45:07] the hell are they going to tax us to
[45:08] have the war well then how the hell are
[45:10] they going to have the war and so you
[45:12] know that's to me that the greatest
[45:13] crime of the fiat currency era that we
[45:15] live in is the way that it's allowed
[45:17] these big corrupt governments to you
[45:20] know go kill people and uh when you know
[45:23] and that's that's just incredibly evil
[45:25] and sad so uh so those two things are to
[45:28] me the most exciting parts of Bitcoin um
[45:30] you know the the side benefit is that
[45:31] we're all going to get
[45:33] rich and that's good too
[45:35] but but you
[45:38] know that's a side effect not not the
[45:41] main effect this is super interesting
[45:43] for me when I talk about nation state
[45:45] adoption because I kind of don't want
[45:47] them to to buy Bitcoin
[45:49] now yeah right you don't want them to
[45:52] have power right yeah know look I mean
[45:54] if you really think longer term I me
[45:56] there's an argument that I mean what are
[45:57] nation states for I mean there was you
[45:59] know they they arose to defend property
[46:02] and and they arose to defend wealth and
[46:04] and uh they arose to create privilege
[46:06] for the people at the top of them um and
[46:09] you know one could argue that you know
[46:11] obviously much flatter systems I think
[46:12] would be you know um much better um you
[46:16] know there there's a substantial
[46:18] argument for that and I I think the
[46:20] decentralization of governments yeah
[46:22] that that I'm all for that I mean I
[46:24] think you know I'm not a complete uh
[46:27] Anarchist I mean I I think there is I
[46:29] think most civilized human beings would
[46:30] agree that having some government
[46:31] structure makes sense from a um
[46:34] protecting life and Liberty and property
[46:36] um you know I I like having police
[46:38] officers I like having courts I like
[46:40] thinking that criminals will be punished
[46:42] and I'm certainly willing to pay my fair
[46:43] share of the taxes to have those things
[46:45] occur but um beyond that I I kind of
[46:49] look at government I go you know okay
[46:50] everything else you're doing no not
[46:52] really interested in
[46:54] that let's just let's just stick to the
[46:56] life Liberty and safety and rule of law
[46:59] that that's all you know and if somebody
[47:01] said you got to pay 20% of your income
[47:02] to make sure you have those things I'd
[47:04] say done I'm I'm totally good with it
[47:06] but I think we could do it for a lot
[47:07] less than 20% of our incomes even
[47:10] absolutely yeah um let's talk a little
[47:13] bit about nation state adoption
[47:15] especially short term is really
[47:16] interesting uh I mean the the podcast
[47:18] will come out after after the election
[47:22] interesting to we have more information
[47:24] on that uh how do you see that if
[47:26] potentially Trump gets in Lumis is there
[47:28] there's Dennis Porter there's RFK
[47:31] there's
[47:32] RI how do you see that in the US look
[47:34] I'm extremely encouraged I mean you have
[47:36] to remember a few years ago Trump was
[47:37] not very big on bitcoin and I think that
[47:40] um you know VC got into his ear and then
[47:42] I think Senator Lumis did as well and
[47:44] you know I have to say I've been I've
[47:47] been impressed and and with with Trump's
[47:49] evolve the way Trump is evolved uh in
[47:51] terms of who he is and what he's seen I
[47:53] mean he's I think he's learned and he's
[47:55] asked for help and and and the fact he's
[47:57] got some of these other people around
[47:58] him who I think can help him is a big
[48:00] positive um you know obviously on a from
[48:03] a crypto and and sound money standpoint
[48:06] um you know he wins all day long versus
[48:08] her um I you know I'm hesitant to
[48:12] because there people on both sides of
[48:13] the spectrum I I hate the whole blue red
[48:15] debate we're all just Americans I I hate
[48:17] that whole thing and um at the ex the
[48:19] extremes on both sides are crazy in my
[48:21] view I tend to be much more of a
[48:22] Centrist but uh obviously I lean in One
[48:25] Direction on this you know on this
[48:26] election because of for a number of
[48:28] reasons but um you the the point is that
[48:31] um you know government can and will have
[48:35] to be responsive to the people I think
[48:36] that it's very interesting that in the
[48:38] past um you know when when they were
[48:40] talking about a lot of the crypto stuff
[48:42] you remember a year or two ago where
[48:43] they were really kind of coming down on
[48:44] it and it was something that was passed
[48:46] in Congress I can't remember the
[48:47] specifics but and it led to kind of a
[48:49] telephone campaign and and just people
[48:51] flooding DC with calls and complaints
[48:53] and this that and the other it was an
[48:55] anti-crypto move and and you know they
[48:57] kind of backed off on it and uh look at
[48:59] the end of the day politicians have to
[49:01] get votes and um one of the things
[49:03] that's positive and I I'm a I'm very
[49:05] much of Maxi I I'm all Bitcoin I hate
[49:07] all the other coins but I'll tell you
[49:09] the one thing that is good about all the
[49:10] other crypto players is that they're
[49:12] they are you know they're in favor of
[49:15] less less crypto regulation and and you
[49:17] know no Gary Gensler and um and and they
[49:20] do represent big numbers and so to the
[49:22] degree that that can you know keep the
[49:24] government away from Bitcoin and and um
[49:28] and crypto then then I'm good with that
[49:30] in terms of the Strategic Reserve I
[49:32] think it's brilliant I mean I this is
[49:33] Jason Lowry's thesis um I hope they do
[49:36] it um I thought R I was at I was in
[49:39] Nashville I listened to Trump speech I
[49:40] listened to RFK speech I thought RFK
[49:42] speech was brilliant um of course it was
[49:44] written by Brian eses and his wife but
[49:46] um but but I think RFK does believe
[49:48] those things and um and my sense is that
[49:52] um this you know if Trump wins this will
[49:54] be a much more friendly environment for
[49:56] you know the Caitlin of the world and
[49:58] and the bitcoiners of the world and and
[50:00] that's a very good thing in my opinion
[50:01] because I think Bitcoin is going to save
[50:03] the world so um you know let's hope
[50:06] that's how it goes down but we'll just
[50:07] have to wait and see I mean it um you
[50:10] know I I uh I'm reminded of of the
[50:14] Stalin quote that it's who votes who
[50:15] counts the votes that matters right so
[50:19] uh you know call me somewhat of a
[50:21] skeptic I I but it would appear based on
[50:24] what I'm seeing in the United States
[50:25] that Trump is going to win
[50:28] it's um as as my audience is split like
[50:30] 50% around that in America and 50% in
[50:34] rest of the world um do you think that
[50:36] the outcome of the election and uh us
[50:40] politices uh in general because America
[50:43] is such a big place for finances
[50:45] especially um has Global impact on on
[50:48] bitcoin or just is it the United States
[50:50] does I mean I think it does look I think
[50:52] bitcoin's going to win no matter what
[50:53] happens in this election I mean I think
[50:55] let's let's say she wins and let's say
[50:57] you know Warren continues with her
[50:58] anti-crypto nonsense and and you know
[51:00] let's say they try and do a lot of
[51:02] negative things the push back is going
[51:03] to be enormous and um you know it's it's
[51:07] it's one of those things where no matter
[51:08] what they do I think Bitcoin wins having
[51:11] said that though I think that you know
[51:13] it'd be much better and it will be an
[51:15] easier path if we have an Administration
[51:17] that's friendly to bitcoin and and it's
[51:19] building a strategic reserve and that
[51:21] you I mean one of one of the biggest
[51:22] things I think could happen to be a huge
[51:24] positive and Trump actually just
[51:25] mentioned it the other day to somebody
[51:27] um would be for Bitcoin to be and and
[51:29] and this in my book I write about this
[51:30] as well you know Bitcoin gold and silver
[51:32] should all be legal tender and what that
[51:34] means is that holding them and then
[51:37] selling them should not represent a
[51:38] capital gain or a capital transaction in
[51:40] other words they they're all money
[51:42] they're all the dollar is a form of
[51:43] money Bitcoin is a form of money Gold's
[51:45] money Silver's money they're all money
[51:47] and so you don't you know when you when
[51:48] you trade a dollar I mean a dollar is a
[51:50] dollar but you you don't because it's
[51:51] and it's the numer rare but the point is
[51:54] money shouldn't lead to the appreciation
[51:56] of one money in terms of another money
[51:58] should not lead to a capital transaction
[52:00] a capital gains event and uh and I heard
[52:04] Trump the other day say something along
[52:05] the lines if he was thinking about he he
[52:07] agreed with somebody who said you should
[52:08] eliminate the tax on capital gains in
[52:10] Bitcoin the United States that would be
[52:11] a big deal um and I'm not sure he'll be
[52:14] able to get it done but if he did that
[52:16] would be a big deal so so yes it's it's
[52:18] certainly more positive for Bitcoin in
[52:20] One Direction versus the other I mean he
[52:23] even doed on on Rog I think uh around
[52:25] dropping income tax for for terrorists
[52:28] or something like that I I only heard it
[52:30] R only heard it uh by chance yeah yeah
[52:33] yeah he said he said some good tax
[52:35] proposals I
[52:36] mean look this the the federal
[52:39] government I mean I I wouldn't want to
[52:41] be any of these guys I mean they've got
[52:42] a really really tough problem it's a
[52:44] gordian knot and uh you know and
[52:47] somebody's not going to be happy I mean
[52:49] the fact of the matter is too many
[52:51] promises have been made that cannot be
[52:52] delivered upon and um and somebody's
[52:55] going to come up with the short stick um
[52:58] and you know how we get from here to
[52:59] there it's impossible to predict or know
[53:02] um all the all that people like yourself
[53:04] and myself can do and others can do is
[53:06] is we can vote with our feet and we if
[53:08] we have savings we have to decide where
[53:10] to put them and um so such that you know
[53:14] our our in future years they they have
[53:16] purchasing power and and so to me that's
[53:19] why I just I I I try to keep it simple
[53:21] when I'm talking to people look look the
[53:22] government's going to print money right
[53:24] right there's going to be inflation
[53:25] right right okay you got to own stuff
[53:27] the government can't
[53:29] print right I it's really this is really
[53:31] pretty simple you know and government
[53:34] can't print silver the government can't
[53:35] print gold government can't print
[53:37] Bitcoin so you know if you own those
[53:39] things you're you know you're half you
[53:41] got half the battle El um so you know
[53:45] it's it's simple absolutely a question
[53:48] that uh each and every one of my guests
[53:49] get uh is uh what can we learn from you
[53:54] besides uh Bitcoin oh from Bitcoin I
[53:57] don't know um I've talked a bit about
[53:59] other uh on other podcasts I'll mention
[54:01] it to me because it's kind of one of my
[54:02] big things I post my workouts on web
[54:05] which or on Twitter which people linger
[54:06] nuts but uh you know and I'm I'm 67 so
[54:11] um you know one of things I guess I
[54:13] would I would say is that uh uh for the
[54:17] for the listeners who are over 40 I mean
[54:19] that it you know I've observed the decay
[54:21] of the human body as you age and you
[54:23] don't have to worry about this your 20
[54:24] in your 20s but and gets steeper Each
[54:27] decade right and so and when I started
[54:29] the decade of my 50s it got too Steep
[54:32] and so I kind of got nuts about
[54:34] investigating how I arrested that and
[54:36] could change that so I discovered
[54:38] CrossFit so so I'm a big uh I'm a big
[54:40] proponent I guess the one thing I would
[54:42] suggest to people is anybody over 4550
[54:44] who hasn't figured out what their
[54:46] exercise program is going to look like
[54:47] for the balance of their lives they're
[54:50] um they're doing themselves a disservice
[54:52] and so there's a book I recommend to
[54:55] everybody it's an absolute must read
[54:56] book it's called younger next year by
[54:58] Chris Crowley and it's it describes the
[55:00] story of a guy who was in the same boat
[55:02] I was in in his 50s which is he was he
[55:04] was starting to get sick and he was
[55:06] starting he was watching his body
[55:07] deteriorate and he decided to uh take on
[55:10] an extreme exercise regime and it
[55:12] changed his life and I did the same
[55:13] thing and it changed my life so I guess
[55:15] one thing I would say to people who are
[55:16] older is um you know don't be afraid of
[55:19] it um you know learn about exercise
[55:22] learn about the impact it has on your
[55:24] overall health because you know if
[55:26] you're going to live into your 60s 7s
[55:27] 80s I mean that can be you know painful
[55:31] and and and a big decline or you know
[55:33] there are people who are in their 80s
[55:34] and 90s and are super fit and super
[55:35] healthy and and that's but but the price
[55:38] for that is proof of work you've got to
[55:39] youve got to actually exercise every
[55:42] day a lot of people don't want to do
[55:44] that but but I I would suggest that it's
[55:46] a really good thing to do and I know in
[55:47] my case it's really changed my life so
[55:49] that's something I I just I try to
[55:51] emphasize when I'm U when I'm talking to
[55:54] to people on these podcasts one other
[55:55] thing I would say that a lot is I quit
[55:57] drinking in my 30s uh my mid-30s and
[55:59] that's had an enormous impact on my
[56:02] overall health and wellbeing I highly
[56:03] recommend that to anybody
[56:05] so I love that a lot really really cool
[56:08] and another aspect of of training
[56:10] because I do it almost every day uh
[56:13] Saturday Sunday usually not um it's just
[56:16] the mental aspect of it like I feel
[56:18] mentally better on a day that I trained
[56:21] than day that I did not train no don't
[56:23] get me wrong I don't do seven days a
[56:24] week I I take three days off for sure
[56:26] got to especially if you're going hard
[56:28] you've absolutely got to give yourself
[56:29] rest and recovery but um but yeah it it
[56:33] has so many positive impacts in in our
[56:35] life and I it's it's like it's like
[56:37] God's anti-depressant you know what I
[56:38] mean um I think it really is and I mean
[56:41] and and and it you know in terms of just
[56:44] health benefits I the us could solve its
[56:46] Whole Health Care problem if we had
[56:48] everybody doing CrossFit but the odds of
[56:50] them are very high really cool we have
[56:52] an entertain in the podcast as you know
[56:54] where the previous guest is asking a
[56:55] question for the next guest without KN
[56:57] who the next guest actually is and the
[56:59] last guest asked you who is sat nakam
[57:03] yeah I
[57:04] know uh you know I don't really know and
[57:08] I don't and I don't really care and I
[57:10] and I really I want to respect the
[57:11] whoever it is I want to respect the
[57:13] guy's privacy um it's it's a it's a true
[57:16] god-given gift and um and thank God
[57:20] somebody thought of it and whoever it is
[57:23] uh God bless them and I think I think
[57:25] the way handled it by becoming Anonymous
[57:28] was brilliant um and you know we all
[57:31] know the candidates I mean they're and
[57:33] I've met some of the candidates right I
[57:35] mean it could be Adam back it could be
[57:37] you know I meet hell it could be hell
[57:39] finny you know could be Len sassamon it
[57:41] could be many many people it might have
[57:42] been a group of them who knows but um I
[57:44] don't think it was the CIA I don't think
[57:46] it was the Deep State um I think it
[57:49] actually really was uh it it came about
[57:52] organically as a result of a bunch of
[57:54] smart people contributing pieces of the
[57:57] puzzle and then somebody maybe a couple
[57:59] of somebody's or maybe just one somebody
[58:01] putting it all together and Publishing
[58:02] the white paper and uh and starting
[58:05] starting it flying and thank God whoever
[58:07] it is did it I mean that's all I have to
[58:09] say um and and I think the prior guest
[58:12] also asked if it was George he also
[58:13] asked if you knew if you knew who it was
[58:15] would you tell everybody and the answer
[58:16] is no I kind of don't want to know and I
[58:19] kind of don't want to tell any everybody
[58:21] I I don't think it's important I think I
[58:23] I think the important thing is that we
[58:25] have it and we should recognize it for
[58:27] what it is I mean it you know it's
[58:31] um yeah it's I mean I almost it's it's
[58:33] weird I mean I I'm spiritual I almost
[58:35] feel like it's divinely given to us I
[58:37] mean it really is kind of an amazing
[58:39] amazing thing I mean it's it's a I don't
[58:42] think people fully understand the scale
[58:44] of what happened when the white paper
[58:46] was published um they will come to they
[58:48] will come to see it over time but I
[58:51] think I think today you know it it'd be
[58:53] as though I don't know you know we were
[58:55] around when the printing press got made
[58:57] you know and only first of all most
[58:59] people were illiterate and second of all
[59:01] only monks could you know translate or
[59:03] copy the Bible you know and imagine
[59:06] compare that to where we are today you
[59:07] know literally everyone can read and you
[59:09] can get information instantly um you
[59:12] know I I imagine you know there were
[59:13] probably similar events around the you
[59:15] know the crucifixion of Christ I mean
[59:17] people at the time didn't really
[59:19] understand what it was or what it meant
[59:20] but you know look at what happened so
[59:22] it's a big deal I mean I'm not trying to
[59:25] be hyperbolic but am saying it's a big
[59:27] big big deal the the invention of true
[59:30] digital scarcity and that's the way I
[59:32] describe it I think more people should
[59:33] describe it that way it's not a
[59:35] cryptocurrency it's it's an invention
[59:37] and the invention is is immutable
[59:40] digital scarcity and you kind of say to
[59:42] yourself why does that matter well it
[59:43] matters because in one particular area
[59:46] we've had you know Millennia worth
[59:48] thousands and thousands of years of
[59:49] monetary
[59:50] debasement and we just stopped that we
[59:53] just put an end to that and it's kind of
[59:55] like whoa that's a big deal that's a
[59:58] really really big deal thousands of
[60:00] years of a problem even with gold I mean
[60:02] it was slow but we you know even gold
[60:03] gets monetarily
[60:05] debased thousands and thousands of years
[60:07] of monetary debasement and we've now got
[60:09] no monetary debasement full stop it's
[60:12] like wow that's you
[60:14] know you know absorb that right it's a
[60:17] big deal so that's that's kind of how I
[60:19] see it this will be studied in history
[60:21] books for sure yeah yeah I think so I
[60:24] think so it cool thank thank you so much
[60:26] Lawrence for for taking a time uh for
[60:28] coming on the show um I think uh I
[60:31] usually ask where people can find you
[60:33] but usually I think know I'm a big
[60:36] loudmouth on Twitter I don't give the
[60:38] central banks a whole lot of breathing
[60:39] room as because they don't deserve it
[60:42] and I do have a website called emat
[60:44] 2.com I'm also involved with something
[60:46] called the Bitcoin opportunity fund
[60:47] which is uh James lavish David Foley
[60:49] myself Greg Foss Mark moss and um you
[60:53] know um we invest in Bitcoin related
[60:56] things so lots of ways to kind of look
[60:59] me up and get a hold of me absolutely
