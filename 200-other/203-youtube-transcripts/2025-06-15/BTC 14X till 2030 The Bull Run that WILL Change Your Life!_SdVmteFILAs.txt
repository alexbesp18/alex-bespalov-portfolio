[00:00] we are front running all these
[00:02] institutions that normally are way in
[00:04] front of us Bitcoin is about ready to
[00:07] explode people that think that we've
[00:09] touched an all-time high I guarantee you
[00:11] that is not the case all the charts
[00:13] right now are just kind of sitting there
[00:15] right where they should be I believe
[00:16] that we'll see a million dollars for a
[00:18] Bitcoin Bitcoin is the greatest monetary
[00:21] invention in the history of mankind if
[00:23] you look at that scurb with the internet
[00:25] right now for Bitcoin it's like 1999 and
[00:28] I was there in 1999 the internet was
[00:31] something that we were all going to use
[00:32] to send mail to each other it rapidly
[00:34] expanded into something that none of us
[00:36] could have imagined that's where Bitcoin
[00:38] is It's 1999 we're about 5% adoption
[00:41] we're in uh wave one here this is a new
[00:44] asset class that's going to take over
[00:46] all of investment portfolios this is
[00:48] your opportunity you want to get as much
[00:50] Bitcoin as you can Choose Wisely your
[00:53] purchases your career choices right now
[00:55] do as much as you can to maximize that
[00:58] stack you will be rewarded in in the
[01:00] future Bitcoin does not generate yield
[01:03] everything that you get that generates
[01:06] return on bitcoin is pairing some type
[01:09] of risk we are that internet based layer
[01:12] to AI Bitcoin that it took for me to
[01:15] purchase that same house was Now 44
[01:17] Bitcoin so it went from 600 to 44 do you
[01:20] know what it is today it's 7 Bitcoin you
[01:23] don't need real estate anymore real
[01:25] estate has so many counterparty risks
[01:31] hi George how you doing everything fine
[01:33] on your end I'm doing good I'm uh
[01:35] looking forward to this um I think this
[01:38] will be an important discussion today
[01:40] for uh both seasoned Bitcoin holders my
[01:44] fellow plbs but even people that are new
[01:46] to this space I've got uh you know my
[01:49] goal here is to make this something
[01:51] that's that can help people going
[01:53] forward because I think we're in a very
[01:55] challenging time in front of us um you
[01:58] know we've talked a little bit about
[02:00] this but I think there's quite of
[02:02] important events that are coming our way
[02:05] oh interesting um before we get to do
[02:08] this because it's already uh uh sounding
[02:10] very interesting I just want to get uh
[02:12] people to understand like how how your
[02:15] background is because I think like
[02:17] usually I'm not the podcaster that asks
[02:19] oh please introduce yourself because
[02:21] usually the the question is quite boring
[02:23] for me but I think in your case it's
[02:25] actually quite interesting because you
[02:27] have done so many different things uh
[02:29] and experienced life in so many
[02:30] different ways uh so I think it could be
[02:33] interesting for the viewers okay what
[02:34] have you done uh what was your past uh
[02:37] and what what did you experience uh what
[02:39] also maybe influenced your thinking now
[02:41] about Bitcoin well it's true that this
[02:44] is I'm a very uh I have an unusual
[02:47] background uh especially in the way that
[02:51] it brought me to bitcoin um you know I
[02:54] grew up uh just in the 70s back in uh
[03:00] Colorado and from there uh I went to uh
[03:04] uh college and ended up dropping out
[03:07] this was up in Wyoming uh actually I had
[03:10] already been um I had left High School
[03:13] actually I was expelled from high school
[03:16] uh which is I think it's called
[03:18] gymnasium as I mentioned maybe in
[03:20] Germany or it's when you're about 17 18
[03:23] years old and for the European viewers
[03:26] you know this means the next step is uh
[03:28] University College we call it here and
[03:32] uh I un unfortunately it was for uh
[03:36] fighting in those days and it was with a
[03:40] teacher so I'm very fortunate you know
[03:43] timings everything today I think if I
[03:45] had engaged in the behavior I did then I
[03:48] I probably would have been incarcerated
[03:51] so but they just expelled me from high
[03:53] school and my parents uh I just my
[03:56] parents were really a great support
[03:58] group they advised me that I probably
[04:01] should not go back uh so at this time I
[04:05] got very interested in aviation I'd
[04:06] always loved planes and I started
[04:08] fairing airplanes around the United
[04:10] States I was 17 years old I was out of
[04:12] high school I didn't really have any
[04:13] skill set but I wanted to build time and
[04:16] if you know anything about flying that's
[04:19] really a key component you have to build
[04:21] hours in a plane in order to get
[04:24] qualifications so this guy that I was
[04:26] flying for was like a used car dealer
[04:28] but he was dealing in Planes
[04:30] uh out in Colorado he would buy planes
[04:32] sight unseen I would get on a Greyhound
[04:35] bus I'd go up to wherever it was often
[04:38] on a grass strip get in the plane try
[04:41] and read the owner's manual get familiar
[04:43] with it and then take off and bring the
[04:46] plane back to him um so it was an
[04:49] interesting experience but I did that
[04:51] and I got my hours and I actually got my
[04:53] license uh I got a commercial license
[04:56] but the thing is that you couldn't
[04:57] really do anything with it without
[04:59] College
[05:00] so I went uh went to college uh up in
[05:03] Wyoming I ended up dropping
[05:06] out and I started working in the oil
[05:08] fields up there in Wyoming uh and and it
[05:13] was a very difficult job as you can
[05:15] imagine from there I then went I I
[05:17] became a cop I was a city cop for quite
[05:19] a while and uh after that uh again I
[05:24] just couldn't seem to find a place that
[05:25] I fit in well and ended up working
[05:29] underground as a miner I went back to
[05:32] Colorado and worked on a hard rock mine
[05:34] deep mine I mean I was down I worked
[05:37] down probably as far as two miles down
[05:40] it was so far down that when you get in
[05:42] the you guys would call it an elevator
[05:44] but we called it a cage and it was like
[05:46] a cage you got in this cage they slammed
[05:49] the door shut sent you down there and it
[05:51] took it took 10 minutes for the cage to
[05:54] get to the bottom of the shaft and in
[05:57] fact it was so long the cable was
[05:59] stretch so long that when you got to the
[06:01] bottom of the shaft they would stop it
[06:03] the guy would stop it but you just keep
[06:05] right on going that cable would stretch
[06:07] out you'd see the you'd see your level
[06:09] go right past you and you'd go right
[06:11] down it would stop and then it would
[06:14] ease itself back up it' go above and
[06:16] then it go down it took about six to
[06:17] seven times before it would stop and you
[06:20] could step off the cage into the drift
[06:22] that's not a tunnel we called them
[06:24] drifts and then I worked down there and
[06:27] you know it became very obvious to me
[06:30] after a while that you know my life was
[06:31] not going anywhere and so I asked my
[06:34] parents I said uh you know if I would
[06:37] you let me live in your basement and
[06:39] would you put me back would you pay for
[06:42] my tuition so I can go to college and at
[06:44] the time uh they said yes and so I drove
[06:48] a cab at night in Denver uh to make
[06:51] money and I actually did really well
[06:54] doing that uh it put I had money for all
[06:57] the time I was going through college and
[06:59] then I graduated right at that time
[07:02] something really unusual is that the US
[07:05] Navy uh and the military in general were
[07:07] really hurting for Pilots uh and I
[07:11] applied obviously I'd already knew how
[07:13] to fly so I I got in I got accepted uh
[07:18] it was very difficult to get in uh I
[07:20] went through a program called uh well if
[07:24] you've ever you're probably not anyone
[07:27] that's older has probably seen that
[07:28] movie Officer a gentleman that's the
[07:30] kind of training I went through down uh
[07:33] there and did you just show up uh they
[07:36] shave your head they start screaming at
[07:38] you they're all Marine d uh most of the
[07:42] time when I was there they were all from
[07:44] Vietnam Vietnam vets and they were a
[07:46] pretty tough lot so uh I went through
[07:49] that because of my flying experience I
[07:51] ended up uh graduating number one in
[07:54] that that particular class so I got to
[07:57] pick whatever I wanted to do and where I
[07:59] wanted to go and I ended up in f-18s
[08:02] Hornets uh which if you watch the last
[08:05] Top Gun movie that's what they're flying
[08:07] they're flying
[08:08] f18s and um after that I uh in fact
[08:12] speaking of Top Gun I I went through Top
[08:15] Gun and then I became an instructor an
[08:16] adversary instructor they called him I
[08:19] went up to Nevada and flew as a Top Gun
[08:21] adversary instructor uh simulating uh
[08:24] Russian planes and tactics that kind of
[08:27] thing um then I got hired by Delta again
[08:31] because of the flying experience and uh
[08:35] ended up uh I worked there for a long
[08:38] time I became a captain and flew there
[08:41] but unfortunately I had a motorcycle
[08:43] accident uh I was really into
[08:45] motorcycles all my life and I built my
[08:47] own uh Chopper uh back several years ago
[08:52] and it was a really neat project I mean
[08:55] my my now wife was dating me and she
[08:58] first met me she walked in the house I
[09:00] had the chopper I had the engine on the
[09:02] table the dining room table I was
[09:04] working on it building I had the frame
[09:06] out there I had welded inside my house
[09:08] house making the frame up so uh
[09:12] unfortunately it was I got hurt on that
[09:14] motorcycle and I had a a tvi a traumatic
[09:17] brain injury it ended my flying career
[09:20] and really kind of started this journey
[09:23] of where I am today which I began
[09:25] working full-time as an artist um and if
[09:29] you remember you know the
[09:31] GFC 2008 crisis that changed a lot of
[09:35] things for many people and for I was one
[09:38] of them I had a really tough time during
[09:40] that period because
[09:41] Investments pension a lot of different
[09:44] things that were going on and I realized
[09:47] that I had to become my own Financial in
[09:50] advisor investor my
[09:52] ra I had to be my hedge fund manager I
[09:56] took that role on and I started studying
[09:58] Finance really
[10:00] deep um I was exposed to Bitcoin in
[10:03] 2012 and I immediately I thought it was
[10:06] a Ponzi scheme a scam it didn't make any
[10:09] sense I had built computers with parts
[10:12] and I I thought well computers always
[10:14] break you'll never keep your Bitcoin I
[10:16] just didn't understand it so it was a
[10:19] hard pass and then unfortunately I
[10:22] didn't do any studying
[10:24] afterwards um I wish I had but 2017 Lynn
[10:29] Alden uh I was on Seeking Alpha quite a
[10:32] bit studying macro and stuff she had an
[10:34] article on uh Bitcoin and it was a great
[10:38] article she did a wonderful job but at
[10:40] the same time I could tell that she
[10:42] passed meaning she was interested in it
[10:45] but it wasn't time for her to invest in
[10:47] it um unbeknownst to me she continued to
[10:51] study it very hard and and I didn't I
[10:53] read an article and I said ah again you
[10:56] know it's it's not gonna I'm not sure
[10:58] it's going to make it
[10:59] well 2020 she came out with another
[11:02] article like in January so about four
[11:05] and a half years ago and this time I
[11:07] could tell she she was in uh I'm not
[11:10] saying she was Allin but the article
[11:12] changed my viewpoint and then I went
[11:14] down the rabbit hole so she started it
[11:17] but after that I mean I probably got I
[11:21] don't know how many hours it could be500
[11:23] 2ou I don't know how many hours I have
[11:25] studying Bitcoin but I orange peeled
[11:28] myself after after that and uh and today
[11:33] I'm I'm all in on bitcoin I I love that
[11:35] a lot it's also your story is so
[11:37] interesting because uh it it teaches uh
[11:40] self-studying self-educating a lot and I
[11:43] think with with Bitcoin
[11:45] this is kind of necessary because it
[11:48] will take a long time till the
[11:50] mainstream will educate people on
[11:53] bitcoin I mean maybe black rock is is
[11:56] trying to do that a little bit now but
[11:58] it's it's a small group of people uh
[12:00] with some podcasts with some articles
[12:02] with some books the the the resources
[12:04] are now way better than 2017 or even
[12:08] 2020 uh but it's still a niche thing uh
[12:11] and and we're still just like starting
[12:13] out it's really interesting to to to see
[12:16] your uh uh reasoning also why did uh
[12:21] Bitcoin then resonated uh so strongly
[12:23] with you when you read the article and
[12:25] what was it that stood up for you well
[12:27] you know what what you said is really
[12:29] important we this asymmetry of
[12:32] information that that my fellow plebs
[12:35] out there and yourself that what we have
[12:38] is a tremendous power here um and I
[12:42] began to realize that that this asset
[12:46] would become an asset class and it is uh
[12:49] that's very important as an investor uh
[12:53] there are only you know usually there if
[12:55] you ask people an investment adviser to
[12:58] list assets class he'll come up with
[13:00] about eight of them uh and Bitcoin is
[13:04] the newest and think about what that
[13:05] means that that means that it's an a a
[13:08] new asset class that people are going to
[13:10] start investing in widespread so this
[13:13] idea that we have a a symmetry of power
[13:16] through our study and information is
[13:18] something that I realized was very
[13:21] unique you don't sell you don't get this
[13:24] you know all of us out there that are
[13:25] into Bitcoin and those of you who are
[13:28] new we are front running all these
[13:31] institutions that normally are way in
[13:34] front of us these centers of financial
[13:38] power that are close to the cantillon
[13:41] effect they have the ability to
[13:44] capitalize on that information doesn't
[13:47] matter whether it's Black Rock if it's
[13:49] institutions such as Pension funds hedge
[13:52] fund managers family offices all of
[13:55] these institutions normally have a
[13:57] tremendous advantage over us but they
[13:59] don't this time if you're willing to do
[14:01] the work if you're willing to study and
[14:04] understand what you hold then you are in
[14:06] a very unique position that seldom comes
[14:09] around so for me that conviction that
[14:14] that is what led me to to think to
[14:16] myself this is an unusual asset that's
[14:20] once in a lifetime and I mean that
[14:24] um that kind of sums up how I feel about
[14:27] the asset uh there's some other things
[14:29] I'd like to talk about though as far as
[14:31] our symmetry of information and how
[14:34] important this time is absolutely very
[14:36] cool um is that kind of I mean you have
[14:40] uh 68 years I think uh you said that uh
[14:44] you're young now um do you think that's
[14:47] the biggest or greatest opportunity you
[14:49] you ever saw right now I do there there
[14:52] is nothing uh that I've ever seen like
[14:54] this for instance you know as I
[14:56] mentioned from 2008 on I've been
[14:59] studying finances and assets macro
[15:02] trying to invest and uh maybe it's
[15:06] because I'm an artist but the very first
[15:08] time I ever saw Bitcoin in a log chart
[15:13] price time in log form the very first
[15:17] time I ever saw it I was blown away I I
[15:20] looked at the chart and I thought this
[15:22] is unlike anything I have ever seen
[15:25] before there's no asset there's no
[15:29] there's no equity there's no commodity
[15:30] I've never seen anything with that
[15:32] pattern it was almost like math um and
[15:36] so it just blew me away and it furthered
[15:37] my
[15:38] conviction um you know right now this is
[15:43] a really important time that we're in
[15:46] Bitcoin is about ready to explode people
[15:49] that think that we've touched an
[15:51] all-time
[15:52] high there I I guarantee you that is not
[15:55] the case um first off let's make sure
[15:58] that we understand anything I said to
[16:00] say today is not Financial advice I'm
[16:02] often wrong in finance sometimes I come
[16:05] out like a village idiot I have no
[16:08] issues with that but the but the bottom
[16:10] line is that that I am convinced we are
[16:13] on the cusp of a new cycle uh I just
[16:17] checked a lot of the charts I I'm really
[16:19] big into onchain
[16:21] analysis uh all the charts right now are
[16:23] just kind of sitting there right where
[16:26] they should be there's no even the open
[16:28] interest right now I think it's around
[16:30] maybe
[16:32] 15% uh you know sometimes it gets as
[16:35] high as 55% in the last cycle top this
[16:39] this recent one to 73,000 it's nowhere
[16:42] most of the charts if you look at them
[16:45] uh when you get up to like two to three
[16:47] standard deviations above the mean
[16:49] that's a time to be concerned none of
[16:51] that's happening so everything just
[16:53] sitting here we're coiled spring we're
[16:55] ready to go I highly recommend to the
[16:58] viewers out there there's only two
[17:00] subscriptions that I maintain uh right
[17:02] now even though I'm fully committed to
[17:04] bitcoin all my wealth is in Bitcoin or
[17:07] one proxy and uh these two sources that
[17:11] I follow I I use James check which
[17:14] you've had him on your podcast before I
[17:16] I believe from Australia uh he maintains
[17:19] on substack made the head on check chain
[17:22] uh check on chain and for free he has an
[17:26] entire Suite of these charts that you
[17:28] can familiar with yourself with and the
[17:30] only other thing that I do is I
[17:32] subscribe to Lynn alden's premium
[17:35] subscription it's not very expensive but
[17:37] it just for the macro viewpoint but what
[17:40] I'm going to say is that you know we're
[17:42] going to see an explosion here in the
[17:45] remaining of this cycle and we've got
[17:47] about one more cycle before that train
[17:49] is gone and that means you know in six
[17:53] to eight years I I believe that we'll
[17:55] see a million dollars for a Bitcoin a
[17:58] million dollar Bitcoin in 68 years I'm
[18:01] convinced of it so when I say it's a
[18:04] train what I'm saying is that we're
[18:05] standing on a platform right now all of
[18:07] us you and I actually and my fellow
[18:10] plebs out there some of us are on the
[18:12] train we're holding a ticket we're ready
[18:14] to go uh we're looking out there at all
[18:17] the platform and we see all these people
[18:19] that we think are going to get left
[18:20] behind and you know that's why we often
[18:24] become so anxious about trying to
[18:26] convince our family members or the
[18:28] people that love our friends our close
[18:30] acquaintances to get on board the
[18:32] Bitcoin train because we know what's
[18:35] going to happen and there are people
[18:37] joining all the time adoption is
[18:40] increasing we're at about 5% probably
[18:42] now like
[18:43] 1999 as far as Internet adoption and we
[18:48] want those people with us we and and
[18:50] some people have got the train window
[18:52] open they're yelling out into the
[18:53] platform hey get on board but soon the
[18:56] Train's leaving and if you've ever
[18:58] watched people that that are going to
[19:00] miss their train some of them will step
[19:02] on board you can at the last second you
[19:03] can get on board just at the last minute
[19:05] some people if you've ever seen it you
[19:08] know they'll try to run along with the
[19:09] train and you can run with the train for
[19:12] a little while but eventually that
[19:14] Train's going to pick up speed and
[19:16] you're going to see the end of it
[19:17] disappearing in the distance now for
[19:19] those who say
[19:21] um well George you know I can buy in in
[19:25] eight years you know when bitcoin's a
[19:28] million dollars a coin I can still buy
[19:29] SATs I can buy you know $1,000 worth of
[19:32] SATs that's true but what I'm trying to
[19:35] talk about is generational wealth what
[19:37] what you can create right now is
[19:40] incredible and it is an
[19:42] opportunity and you know for me I've
[19:45] stopped trying to orange pill people uh
[19:48] directly I just have given up uh in my
[19:51] family uh really only one person got it
[19:54] and and the good news is he stacked
[19:57] stacked like a son of a [ __ ] he's he's
[19:59] probably set but I'm just going to
[20:02] create generational wealth for the
[20:04] people that I love and then when I'm
[20:07] gone there'll be another train com along
[20:09] and they can step on board that platform
[20:11] then I I I love that analogy so much
[20:13] it's it's it's really good and also the
[20:16] the orange peeling the The Loft ones I
[20:18] think we we kind of have to start
[20:20] stacking so hard that we can be there
[20:24] for our loved ones that are right now
[20:27] not willing to get on the train if we
[20:29] tried everything in our power to Orange
[20:32] build them because sometimes you're just
[20:34] out of the power and you cannot orange
[20:36] build them and you should not force them
[20:37] to do anything especially financially
[20:40] not um even though if Bitcoin is a great
[20:42] success it's probably still not a good
[20:44] idea for your relationship with them um
[20:47] but it's really interesting the the idea
[20:49] of a train leaving and also like this
[20:51] this special window that we are
[20:53] currently in um what why do you think is
[20:57] right now that the time so uh valuable
[21:01] to get into Bitcoin wise like the next
[21:04] few years the the the time where where
[21:07] Bitcoin uh is about to break out you
[21:10] also mentioned before in a in a side s
[21:13] sentence that you think there's
[21:15] challenging times ahead of us uh what do
[21:17] you mean with with all that well getting
[21:19] to the first point here
[21:22] um we've had that unique opportunity
[21:25] those of us that have been in here early
[21:27] and have been studying but quite frankly
[21:29] that that asymmetry is it's changing you
[21:34] know if you look at just what's happened
[21:36] over the last year if you look since
[21:39] January with the adoption the ETFs that
[21:42] have come onto the market if you look at
[21:45] uh the accounting rule changes uh fby
[21:48] rules are going to come in effect
[21:49] January 1st so we're only a couple
[21:51] months away from that and that's huge
[21:54] that is going to mean that every company
[21:57] out there on planet Earth is going to be
[21:59] using this new best practices for how
[22:03] they report Bitcoin on their balance
[22:04] sheets and quite frankly right now it's
[22:07] treated as an intangible property or
[22:10] asset one of the worst ways it could be
[22:12] treated it's one of the things that's
[22:14] held back corporate adoption well that's
[22:16] going to be gone and when it's gone you
[22:19] are going to see a lot more treasuries
[22:22] begin to stack
[22:24] Bitcoin uh if you look at the uh uh
[22:28] Black Rock
[22:29] recent uh investor newsletter or their
[22:32] talk that they recently gave uh they're
[22:35] they're getting it they understand it
[22:37] and they're not alone you know Fidelity
[22:39] has been mining Bitcoin since I think
[22:42] around
[22:44] 2015 they've been mining Bitcoin they're
[22:46] they're deep into the Bitcoin hole
[22:48] they're one of only two companies that
[22:50] are actually self- cussing their Bitcoin
[22:53] all the rest of them are using coinbase
[22:56] so there's deep knowledge here it's it's
[23:00] coming and that uh that asset class
[23:04] designation is very important it means
[23:07] that raas uh uh hedge funds mutual funds
[23:12] pension Pension funds are going to start
[23:15] uh dipping their toe in here Wisconsin
[23:17] just put in
[23:18] $155 million doar into Bitcoin and for
[23:22] them that is oneth of 1% of their
[23:26] investable assets so what they're doing
[23:28] is they're sticking their little toe in
[23:30] there to see if it's hot or not and once
[23:32] they're in there and they begin to see
[23:35] the
[23:36] returns they probably won't rebalance
[23:39] that in fact they'll probably increase
[23:41] that exposure so what's coming is going
[23:44] to it's going to rock your world it's
[23:47] going to be a come to Jesus moment for a
[23:50] lot of people so I'm I'm still a
[23:54] believer in the four-year cycle uh I
[23:56] haven't I haven't seen that broken yet
[23:59] but we only have three Cycles to watch
[24:02] that and we don't really know where this
[24:04] is going and if you look if you look
[24:08] at adoption of technology so Bitcoin is
[24:12] the greatest monetary invention in the
[24:15] history of mankind but it's also the
[24:17] greatest
[24:19] technological monetary investment or uh
[24:22] invention and what that means is if it's
[24:25] on a
[24:26] technological adoption curve we normally
[24:29] refer that as an
[24:31] s-curve and as I mentioned if you look
[24:33] at that scurve with the internet right
[24:35] now for Bitcoin it's like 1999 and I was
[24:38] there in 1999 I remember what it was
[24:40] like you know the internet was something
[24:43] that we were all going to use to send
[24:45] mail to each other we're going to stop
[24:46] writing letters and we were going to use
[24:49] mail well there it rapidly ex expanded
[24:52] into something that none of us very few
[24:54] of us could have imagined well that's
[24:57] where Bitcoin is It's 1999 we're about
[25:00] 5% adoption it's like we're in uh you
[25:02] know wave one here and if if if this is
[25:07] an scurve this next cycle might actually
[25:10] break that fouryear cycle and if it's
[25:12] not this one it might be the next one I
[25:14] don't know again I don't know the future
[25:18] I just know that we are about ready to
[25:20] take off and it's important for all of
[25:24] you out there my fellow plebs my my
[25:27] fellow bitcoiners new viit
[25:29] corners anyone that you are able to talk
[25:33] to this is a very important period right
[25:35] now absolutely it's a it's it's the it's
[25:39] the greatest uh opportunity I have ever
[25:41] seen but my life is very short like I
[25:44] have 25 years basically uh if you count
[25:47] even like the first years but uh it's
[25:49] it's very impressive to see people that
[25:52] above 60 sometimes I even had people on
[25:55] above 70 I think the the oldest one was
[25:58] 76 I I I believe or is 76 uh I believe
[26:03] so like when when those people who have
[26:06] the context uh of the com bubble of
[26:10] those all those amazing technology
[26:12] advancements from the the landline phone
[26:14] or the cell phone and all those those
[26:17] technology advancement where they
[26:19] actually lived through that and saw the
[26:20] opportunities and the possibilities they
[26:23] they like oh like that's Bitcoin right
[26:25] now like that's that's the thing you
[26:27] have to pay attention to to right now in
[26:29] that generation at that time at 2024
[26:32] 2025 uh that gives me a lot of um uh a
[26:36] lot of U uh confidence and a lot of uh
[26:40] confirmation in that exactly what I what
[26:43] I've believing in uh so that I I love
[26:46] that uh that uh you bring it like like
[26:49] that
[26:49] here well thank you you know I had a
[26:52] chance to sit with uh like just like
[26:55] this one-on-one with Bill Miller I don't
[26:58] know if the the senior the dad I don't
[27:00] know if you know who he is but he's a
[27:03] you know a brilliant investor a
[27:06] billionaire and you know when you get a
[27:08] chance to just sit down one-on-one and
[27:10] talk to somebody like that you do a lot
[27:12] of listening and one of the things that
[27:15] he told me as almost Sage advice is the
[27:20] fact that he had been into Bitcoin for a
[27:21] long time they had continued to believe
[27:24] and stack Bitcoin and they had never
[27:26] sold Bitcoin think about that that's
[27:29] very unusual so it's not an investment
[27:31] that he's thinking about turning over he
[27:34] sees it the same way this is
[27:35] generational wealth and I if we're
[27:38] correct in what we're saying here and
[27:41] and this is a new asset class that's
[27:43] going to take over all of investment
[27:46] portfolios all of the assets out there
[27:48] there that investable we probably have
[27:50] like maybe hundreds $900 trillion
[27:53] dollars of investable assets out there
[27:56] it just that figure depends upon what
[27:59] you consider investable but the thing is
[28:02] that much of that is going to go into
[28:04] Bitcoin so although I'm sitting here in
[28:07] my studio and in my chair I like to
[28:10] think of this as like a three-legged
[28:11] stool that we're on and the the
[28:15] three-legged stool is a very stable
[28:17] platform it's been in use it's one of
[28:19] the oldest pieces of furniture in the
[28:21] history of mankind it's been uh used for
[28:24] Millennia you can find a stool in toon
[28:27] Commons tomb in the pyramids so it's
[28:31] been used forever and it's and for a
[28:34] reason it if you look at it and you
[28:37] think of it that way the the most
[28:39] important thing right now is to to get
[28:42] Bitcoin to stack as much Bitcoin as you
[28:44] can like a
[28:46] psychopath uh you know I know that you
[28:49] passed up on a a purchasing a house and
[28:53] I think that was a very wise decision
[28:56] this narrow window we have this is not a
[28:58] time when you want to be out you know I
[29:01] love watches but at the same time and I
[29:04] know you have watches that you love too
[29:06] I'm very careful about how I allocate my
[29:09] assets every purchase is important now
[29:12] for me personally I'm in a position now
[29:16] where I don't need any more Bitcoin I
[29:18] don't want any more Bitcoin
[29:21] um I have enough you know I want Bitcoin
[29:25] to spread around I want other people to
[29:26] have Bitcoin too
[29:28] um you know I don't know if you're
[29:30] familiar with Kurt baget an author or
[29:34] Joseph heler uh who wrote catch22
[29:38] wonderful book um they were at a party
[29:41] one time given by a hedge fund
[29:44] billionaire it was in Shelter Island and
[29:48] this billionaire obviously was a be
[29:49] wonderful party and Kurt looked over at
[29:52] Joseph heler the
[29:54] successful world-renowned artist and
[29:57] writer
[29:58] and he said to him he said you know look
[30:00] at that guy there he he has made more
[30:02] money in one day than you probably have
[30:05] made through all your
[30:07] royalties on your book and he says how
[30:10] does that make you feel and Joseph said
[30:13] I I have something that he will never
[30:17] possess I have enough and what he meant
[30:20] was he could be satisfied he he he
[30:23] didn't need to have more but for my
[30:26] fellow plebs out there that are backing
[30:28] or for those who are new to this space
[30:32] this is your opportunity you want to get
[30:34] as much Bitcoin as you can
[30:37] um and so choose WID wisely your
[30:40] purchases your career choices right now
[30:44] do as much as you can to maximize that
[30:46] stack uh you will be rewarded in the
[30:49] future and then you know if you think of
[30:52] the
[30:53] stool the second leg on that stool is
[30:57] it's very simple all you have to do is
[30:58] just huddle you know all you have to do
[31:01] is just hold on to your Bitcoin that's
[31:03] it now I used to kind of stop the
[31:06] conversation there I mean that if you
[31:08] can just get Bitcoin hold on to it
[31:11] that's great but the thing is that I've
[31:13] seen so many people lose their Bitcoin
[31:15] that I really think the third part the
[31:17] third part of this stool is you have to
[31:20] keep that Bitcoin you cannot lose the
[31:22] Bitcoin and how do people lose it they
[31:25] lose it through uh exchanges uh
[31:29] leverage this is really important what
[31:31] I'm going to say right now Bitcoin does
[31:34] not generate yield I'll say it again
[31:38] Bitcoin does not generate yield there is
[31:41] no yield if you own Bitcoin and it's on
[31:44] a wallet in Cold Storage there is no
[31:48] yield so
[31:50] everything that you get that generates
[31:53] return on bitcoin from going forward is
[31:58] carrying some type of risk some
[32:00] counterpart party risk you had one guest
[32:03] on here who lost his Bitcoin by lending
[32:06] it it was uh I think it was Celsius was
[32:09] the platform and you know I understand
[32:13] it but at the same time he went back
[32:15] twice to Celsius to generate a yield and
[32:18] what did he earn I mean when you think
[32:20] about it what Celsius was offering it
[32:22] wasn't that much and he risked his
[32:25] Bitcoin and lost it now it's a great
[32:27] lesson and I hope people take it well
[32:31] but
[32:33] don't don't use leverage to the point
[32:36] where you can be called Mark to market
[32:38] the next day and lose your Bitcoin or on
[32:40] a weekend Bitcoin trades 247 every time
[32:44] that you take risk where you don't have
[32:48] access to whatever that leverag product
[32:50] is on the weekend or after in the
[32:53] evening you're taking risk um you're
[32:56] risking in Cold Storage you know even
[33:01] Hardware wallets who are you using for
[33:03] your Hardware wallet uh there is risk
[33:06] associated with all these different
[33:07] custody
[33:08] methods uh even your your savings plan
[33:12] your DCA plan is a risk it can be and I
[33:16] I'll tell you why if I'm right that
[33:18] Bitcoin is going
[33:21] to water eyes in the
[33:24] future what is going to happen to
[33:26] Bitcoin in its scalability are you
[33:29] familiar with the U blockchain trilemma
[33:34] yeah this the scaling issues and the
[33:36] blockchain Dilemma that you cannot have
[33:38] decentralization Security in this
[33:40] exactly and so you know when you think
[33:43] about it those are three things you can
[33:46] have also now Satoshi wisely chose as
[33:49] this base layer money for
[33:51] decentralization and security and and
[33:54] thank you Satoshi but that's scalability
[33:59] issue is still there and meaning that as
[34:03] we go forward let's just say that
[34:06] Bitcoin is a million dollars a coin in
[34:09] eight years that means that the block
[34:12] space that block space and even the M
[34:16] poool are going to become some of the
[34:19] most valuable real estate you can
[34:21] imagine you are going to get to a point
[34:24] where ordinary
[34:26] people that are out there right now
[34:29] watching this are not going to be able
[34:31] to act on the base layer or they're
[34:34] going to pay huge fees this ordinal nft
[34:38] thing that we went through recently it's
[34:41] been a blessing in disguise uh I don't
[34:44] know about you personally but in this
[34:46] low fee environment last time I checked
[34:48] it was like 22 SATs per Vite I have
[34:51] Consolidated my utxos I've put them
[34:54] together now there are security
[34:56] trade-offs for that but I know that in
[34:58] the future it's going to be $500 it's
[35:02] going to be ,000 someday to transact on
[35:05] the base layer and Men poool you know
[35:08] men poool is also a real estate
[35:11] space imagine um imagine that JP Morgan
[35:16] and all of these custodians all of these
[35:20] ETF
[35:21] purchasers all of these future banks
[35:25] that are coming cuz banks are coming you
[35:27] know JP Morgan Larry Fink he calls and
[35:30] he gets approval for uh bny to start
[35:33] cusing Bitcoin even though they're
[35:35] prohibited from doing it so he he has
[35:38] that pull well you know what other banks
[35:41] are going to want that too and it's
[35:42] coming and when banks are custodians
[35:45] imagine a future in two years from now
[35:48] JP Morgan says I need to transact on the
[35:51] base layer and through the mol I need my
[35:54] transaction included in the mol what
[35:57] well guess what they will pay whatever
[36:00] they need to to get that transaction on
[36:03] there so you myself we're going to be
[36:06] priced out if we're not conscious of
[36:09] this for those of you out there are DCA
[36:12] uh maybe $100 $25 at a time you're
[36:16] stacking like this you need to look at
[36:18] those utxos and you need to start
[36:21] getting them in some management profile
[36:24] that's going to allow you to interact on
[36:26] the base layer going forward so even
[36:29] that policy is a way for you to lose
[36:31] your Bitcoin how else do you lose your
[36:33] Bitcoin uh you know obviously if you
[36:36] have poor security practices falling for
[36:40] scams um all of these things that I'm
[36:43] talking about this this idea
[36:46] of holding your Bitcoin stacking Bitcoin
[36:50] not losing your Bitcoin they all tie
[36:52] into one thing and that is knowledge
[36:55] knowledge builds conviction
[36:58] so why would I at my age and with my
[37:02] Bitcoin that I have why would I keep
[37:04] studying why do I keep spending hours
[37:07] reading about
[37:09] Bitcoin um not only is it fascinating
[37:13] but because I know that it builds
[37:15] conviction you know in this last down
[37:18] cycle this last fouryear cycle I never
[37:20] sold a I never sold one sat I just kept
[37:23] buying I mean I bought all the way up to
[37:25] the top I bought all the way down on the
[37:27] bottom if you watch or listen to my
[37:30] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[37:32] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[37:35] the most important step is to keep the
[37:38] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[37:41] wallet my personal recommendation for
[37:42] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[37:45] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[37:48] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[37:50] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can

[37:56] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[38:00] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[38:03] step is to really level up your
[38:05] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[38:07] have the most secure self- custody setup
[38:10] you have to secure your own devices you
[38:13] have to protect your privacy you have to
[38:16] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[38:19] on where you live you even want to have
[38:21] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[38:24] move in case something goes really
[38:26] really wrong and through all those steps

[38:44] not least I have something completely
[38:46] new for you guys I partnered up with
[38:49] coin vigilante this is the most
[38:52] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[38:55] saw created by anyone look look at that
[38:58] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[39:00] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[39:04] perfect subtle elent way to go out there
[39:07] and show that you are a bitcoiner and
[39:09] that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[39:13] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[39:15] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[39:19] watch collections you have the date of
[39:22] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[39:25] there and of course also the block
[39:27] height and which Epoch we are currently
[39:30] in I love the level of detail they put
[39:33] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[39:36] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[39:39] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[39:41] love those watches so so much I I never
[39:45] stopped I I love that a lot and I just
[39:47] want to give that to the viewers right
[39:50] now because I think it's that's a topic
[39:52] for example I didn't know uh much about
[39:55] before I even started the podcast I
[39:57] learned about uto management and I just
[40:00] wanted to quickly show this to the
[40:02] viewers if you want to learn about utos
[40:04] there's like a one hour 10 minutes
[40:06] Master Class kind of with vicet on here
[40:10] uh he knows a lot about that topic and
[40:12] that's a thing where I like just type in
[40:15] utex O uh in in my in my uh channel uh
[40:20] and that's a thing that actually I think
[40:22] not too many really know about that I
[40:25] think many are not aware of how
[40:29] dangerous that can be in the future and
[40:31] don't take advantage of that low fee
[40:33] time I actually because you said it like
[40:36] one week ago I did a a big utxo
[40:39] management uh session for myself and
[40:41] Consolidated a lot there's always this
[40:43] um like you want to have big uto chunks
[40:47] but you also want to like don't combine
[40:50] utos that you don't want to combine so
[40:52] like it's really like if if you don't
[40:54] know about uo management it's highly uh
[40:56] recommended to check out some videos
[40:58] there are a lot of great resources
[40:59] online this one video is maybe a good
[41:02] starting point where I really try to
[41:04] make it beginner friendly uh but it's
[41:07] but it's really important to get
[41:08] educated on it I love that you also the
[41:11] self-educating uh guy because there is a
[41:15] lot of ways how you can lose a Bitcoin
[41:18] how you can make mistakes but there's
[41:20] great resources out there like when you
[41:22] come in in 2012 and you lost your
[41:24] Bitcoin during 2012 and 2015 it's kind
[41:27] of understandable because all you had a
[41:30] lot of learning processes but now we
[41:32] already know a
[41:33] lot the most things that we we can lose
[41:36] your Bitcoin we know about and we can
[41:38] avoid them and you can uh secure your
[41:40] setup in a better way so uh there
[41:43] there's now I feel like there's no
[41:44] excuse to lose your Bitcoin at that
[41:46] point maybe there was 2012 but not in
[41:48] 2024 is do you also see it like that
[41:52] well you know I I don't want to sound
[41:55] too harsh about
[41:57] people that have you know suffered in
[42:00] this last cycle because you know let's
[42:03] just let's think about it for a minute
[42:05] uh you know Bitcoin is a very difficult
[42:08] subject to understand and a lot of the
[42:11] terms that we use and that terms that
[42:13] the developers employed I wish that we
[42:17] would have had a good marketing
[42:19] team uh at the time when they were
[42:21] coming up with some of these terms and
[42:23] ideas
[42:24] utxo I mean what a stupid idea how do
[42:27] you explain utxo to somebody it's it's
[42:31] very difficult
[42:33] um you know block Space men poool all
[42:36] the terms that we
[42:38] use uh in that in our Bitcoin space are
[42:42] very difficult I to to understand they
[42:45] don't make a lot of sense and you know
[42:47] when we talk about scalability I do
[42:49] think that at some point in the future
[42:52] we are going to see a lot of solutions
[42:56] that involve
[42:58] where they involve uh applications
[43:02] Hardware where we don't really
[43:05] understand the
[43:06] underlying technology we just click and
[43:10] use uh I don't know as far as
[43:13] scalability whether lightning for
[43:15] instance is going to really be able to
[43:17] scale to the the people on this planet
[43:20] you know there are eight billion people
[43:21] on the planet I I'll tell you I'll give
[43:23] you an idea of how difficult this is
[43:26] going to be in the future future there
[43:28] are only in the entire Bitcoin network
[43:32] over a year you're only going to have
[43:35] 150 million transactions you might be
[43:38] able to scale that up to 200 million as
[43:40] people get more smart and and their
[43:44] employment but nonetheless that's not
[43:47] much with eight billion people on the
[43:50] planet that means if I let's just say I
[43:53] had 100 Bitcoin and I wanted to give
[43:55] away a little bit to every sing single
[43:57] person on the planet uh Bob Bernett the
[44:00] CEO of barefoot mining just had a uh he
[44:03] just mentioned this on a podcast so if I
[44:05] wanted to give that to every person in
[44:07] the world it would take
[44:09] me I think it was 150
[44:14] years it's
[44:16] astronomical so Bitcoin on the base
[44:19] layer has to scale and Satoshi knew this
[44:22] even how feny talks about this whether
[44:25] lightning can do that I'm not sure could
[44:27] be a Peg Side chain it could be
[44:29] something like a liquid I'm a big fan of
[44:31] the aqua wallet something I just
[44:33] downloaded recently I've been playing
[44:35] with it you know you've got the Bitcoin
[44:37] on it you've got tether you've got uh
[44:41] liquid
[44:42] Bitcoin and uh I think if I didn't say
[44:46] just BTC but what's neat about that this
[44:49] pegged Bitcoin is that it's fast the
[44:54] transactions are very cheap they're uh
[44:57] confidential the transactions that's
[44:59] important to me uh it runs very fast
[45:03] their blocks are generated every one
[45:05] minute and two minute confirmations so
[45:08] it's quick it takes you when you first
[45:10] peg into it when you put your Bitcoin
[45:12] onto that uh Peg it takes them about 102
[45:17] confirmations and then it's yours it's
[45:19] in the chain and you can start
[45:20] transacting with it it's very easy to
[45:23] get it off now uh so what's the tradeoff
[45:26] if it works so well what's part of the
[45:28] blockchain tradeoff well the tradeoff is
[45:31] it's centralized there are 15 I call
[45:34] them signatories but I think they're
[45:36] called functionaries in the their world
[45:39] but what it means is of those 15 11 of
[45:43] them have to sign their wallet in order
[45:46] for things to move um so you're giving
[45:50] up centralization again for this
[45:53] privilege now I'm not concerned about
[45:56] that uh in the sense that I don't
[45:58] believe these 15 functionaries are going
[46:01] to rug pull me for one thing many of
[46:03] them are well respected in the space and
[46:05] their their reputation would would be
[46:07] destroyed and they'd be uh they would
[46:10] actually be responsible for legal
[46:13] ramifications but it's a tradeoff I
[46:15] think we're going to see more and more
[46:17] trade-offs because if we want Bitcoin to
[46:18] scale if we want it to be able to be
[46:21] usable by like say your your uncle you
[46:25] know Bitcoin
[46:27] Maxis I used to consider myself a maxi
[46:30] but I'm I'm really not I don't know what
[46:33] you'd call you moderate flexible uh
[46:35] Progressive I really don't care but the
[46:38] idea that there's only one custody
[46:40] solution and it's a hardware wallet air
[46:43] gap Cold Storage that doesn't work for
[46:46] me for instance is that going to work
[46:48] for like a 16-year-old
[46:51] kid if you have any elderly relatives
[46:53] are you going to use a hardware wallet
[46:56] for your
[46:57] 80-year-old
[46:59] grandfather I'm not I'm not even sure at
[47:02] some point I'll trust myself with a
[47:05] hardware wallet and a seed phrase and
[47:07] let's just say let's just say that
[47:09] you're a maxi and you think that's the
[47:10] best way to go and you've got 20 Bitcoin
[47:13] you stick them all on your Hardware
[47:14] wallet is there a c counterparty risk to
[47:16] that Hardware wallet what if you get hit
[47:19] in the head next week and you forget
[47:20] your seed phrase what if you what if you
[47:23] put your seed phrase on a steel plate
[47:25] which is smart where you going to put
[47:27] the steel plate do you bear it in the
[47:28] backyard do you keep it next to the
[47:31] hardware wallet do you keep it in a safe
[47:33] deposit box all of these things carry
[47:36] counterparty risk are you then going to
[47:39] use multisig multisig has risks very
[47:43] much so for instance if are you going to
[47:45] use three are you going to use five
[47:47] wallets and if you use five wallets you
[47:49] know if you lose one of the end pubs
[47:53] you're done your bitcoin's gone you
[47:55] might as well have burned it
[47:57] so that's a counterparty risk uh are you
[48:00] going to keep it on Exchange absolutely
[48:03] that's a risk are you going to trust it
[48:05] with black rock and the ETFs what about
[48:07] the fact that they're all using coinbase
[48:10] you could mitigate the risk put some in
[48:11] Fidelity or bitwise they do their own uh
[48:15] custody bitwise also has proof of
[48:17] reserves which is pretty cool so what
[48:20] I'm trying to say is some people will
[48:22] look at me because I I will tell you
[48:24] something I use all of these Solutions
[48:26] even own uh micro strategy as a proxy
[48:29] for Bitcoin it's the only Equity that I
[48:32] own other than Bitcoin and in my mind
[48:37] it's almost like I'm looking at those 20
[48:39] coins or however many you're looking at
[48:41] I'm putting them in buckets and you know
[48:44] I keep very little Bitcoin I don't keep
[48:47] any Bitcoin like in my residence I keep
[48:50] on my wallet uh that liquid I keep
[48:53] enough that you know if I lose it or
[48:56] somebody takes my I just don't really
[48:59] give a damn so those are all ways to
[49:03] mitigate risk what about what about when
[49:05] I said and it's coming when what about
[49:07] when banks are custody Bitcoin and the
[49:09] bank tells you we have
[49:12] $250,000 FDIC Insurance in the US and so
[49:17] would it be stupid for me to take a
[49:19] couple of Bitcoin and put them in a bank
[49:21] where I know I can be reimbursed if
[49:24] those you know dip shits lose it no it's
[49:27] smart um all these things are coming and
[49:31] they all going to be changes that we get
[49:33] to witness and it's going to happen fast
[49:36] I it's going to water our
[49:40] eyes that's that's there are some great
[49:44] points in there because um self- custody
[49:48] or like where do you custody your
[49:49] Bitcoin and how do you C your Bitcoin
[49:52] it's still there are so many questions
[49:55] to consider there's so many things to
[49:58] consider uh if you keep it on Exchange
[50:01] you obviously have the counter body risk
[50:03] if you keep it on an ETF you have the
[50:05] same thing as on exchanges but if you
[50:07] have self custody and you just have it
[50:09] on one single s c wallet obviously
[50:12] there's a lot of risk involved with that
[50:14] then you always want to have access to
[50:17] them um you don't want to involve too
[50:20] many other people you never want to also
[50:23] build such an amazing multi- signature
[50:25] Hardware wallet uh Solutions where it's
[50:28] like a maze and you can actually don't
[50:30] even you lock yourself out of your own
[50:32] Bitcoin uh basically like there are a
[50:35] lot of ways you can screw up that that's
[50:37] for
[50:38] sure uh so it's it's an it's a question
[50:41] that you really have to to get in there
[50:43] uh and I 100% think that even in a
[50:47] Bitcoin standard World there will be
[50:49] Bitcoin Banks like there will be uh a
[50:51] third party or bank or whatever that
[50:53] takes care of your Bitcoin uh the same
[50:56] way as as people got care uh got their
[51:00] the gold cared for but I love that we
[51:05] have the option of self- custody uh I
[51:08] love myself self- custody uh but think
[51:12] about all the attack vectors like
[51:14] someone coming to your house you don't
[51:16] want to have it in your house someone uh
[51:19] hacking in your PC it should not be on
[51:22] like there like there was also episode
[51:24] uh on my where someone l 25 Bitcoin it
[51:27] was one of the very early episodes that
[51:29] I did like in the I don't know in the
[51:31] first like 20 or 30 episodes that I did
[51:33] he lost 25 Bitcoin in self custody
[51:37] because uh he had uh basically on his
[51:41] computer a passw manager and there there
[51:43] was the pass phrase in there uh the the
[51:46] seed phrase in there so like there there
[51:48] was a lot of things uh there can a lot
[51:51] of things go wrong and it's it's I don't
[51:54] want to make people Fe
[51:56] when we talk like that uh but I also
[51:59] want to wake them up to the to the the
[52:02] thing that they actually have to care
[52:03] for that like if you want to take
[52:05] responsibity of your Bitcoin don't just
[52:07] say it and buy a hardware wallet and put
[52:09] it on there really research about that
[52:11] what you can do uh and maybe even
[52:13] diversify like keep some uh uh keep some
[52:17] on different locations different custom
[52:19] Solutions um yeah maybe if you want to
[52:22] have some in your 41k maybe have someone
[52:25] on an ETF maybe some self custody uh
[52:28] it's it's like there security is always
[52:31] an individual decision individual that
[52:33] there's not one size fits all solutions
[52:37] that's I think that where where I really
[52:38] want to uh to go alof that you mentioned
[52:42] uh the yield on bitcoin because there is
[52:44] no yield on bitcoin if you give away
[52:47] someone your Bitcoin and he gives you
[52:48] yield for that this means he's playing
[52:51] with your Bitcoin and you're betting on
[52:53] him playing good and that's I think
[52:55] that's a bad bad to to take because how
[52:58] how much better can can it get what does
[53:00] it do like of of course he invests in
[53:02] altcoins of course he invests in other
[53:04] things uh and that can turn out really
[53:07] badly FDX Celsius even FDX did it un you
[53:11] didn't even knew about it uh so yeah
[53:14] there a I love that you're also um
[53:16] making people cautious about that um one
[53:19] thing we did not touch on uh today at
[53:22] least not on a big way um you were a
[53:25] minor also but now are you in in any way
[53:29] shape or form also in Bitcoin mining
[53:31] like I think it was coal mining uh you
[53:34] did so is is is there any interest for
[53:37] you in in mining Bitcoin solo mining
[53:39] Bitcoin are you investing in anything
[53:41] like that well I am because again I just
[53:46] wanted to try mining so that I could
[53:49] begin to study it and learn about that
[53:53] that structure that infrastructure
[53:55] behind Bitcoin
[53:57] um you know mining is a brutal Cutthroat
[54:01] operation one of the things that's
[54:03] wonderful about mining is if you're
[54:04] doing mining you can get non kyc Bitcoin
[54:08] for yourself and put it into wallet but
[54:12] for me my lesson that I've learned from
[54:15] mining is that nothing is going to be
[54:20] able to beat the return and the
[54:24] risk-free return that is going to come
[54:26] from just buying Bitcoin self- custody
[54:29] Bitcoin and sitting there on my hands
[54:32] and not losing the Bitcoin you know you
[54:35] mention I do want to talk about
[54:37] something you mentioned Banks and uh and
[54:39] the fact that you want to be your own
[54:41] Sovereign Bank too and you know what's
[54:44] wonderful about a lot of the things that
[54:46] I just talked about is that the ultimate
[54:50] Freedom that Bitcoin gives you is that
[54:52] you can put it on a wallet or you can
[54:55] memorize
[54:57] 12 words and you can go anywhere you
[55:00] want you can cross any border border you
[55:03] want with your wealth what do what do
[55:05] countries do when they're under durest
[55:07] War political
[55:09] conflict uh all kinds of of civil unrest
[55:14] they in they impose Capital controls so
[55:17] you might not be able to withdraw
[55:19] Capital you might not be able to uh take
[55:22] your wealth with you your wealth might
[55:24] be confiscated you saw that that Italy
[55:26] just today uh said they're going to
[55:29] increase capital gains on bitcoin up uh
[55:31] from 26 to 42% over and when that
[55:35] happens if you're stuck there that's
[55:38] going to be the regime so you know
[55:40] what's wonderful about Bitcoin you can
[55:42] come up to that border you can have
[55:44] those 12 words in your head they can
[55:46] strip search you you know they can probe
[55:48] you they can have a blast they can make
[55:49] fun of you they can send you across the
[55:52] border into your new country without any
[55:53] clothes on but your skibbies and you
[55:55] know what when you're done when you walk
[55:57] across the border you can look back and
[55:59] flip them off and you basically own your
[56:02] own wealth still that's a powerful thing
[56:06] so you can still some of these solutions
[56:09] that I'm talking about or just I don't
[56:12] know these different things that are
[56:13] going to come along doesn't mean that
[56:15] you can't take that b Bitcoin and put it
[56:17] back where it
[56:18] belongs uh it just means that for
[56:21] somebody my age and where I'm at I see a
[56:25] lot of these things as Solutions and
[56:28] another thing Robin I want to talk about
[56:30] because you mentioned this too and it's
[56:31] really important yield pursuit of yield
[56:34] has been a real problem for bitcoiners
[56:37] it and it is where a lot of the losses
[56:40] have occurred
[56:42] but going forward there are going to be
[56:45] ways
[56:47] that you can earn a yield or maybe a
[56:51] return on your Bitcoin and it's
[56:54] difficult concept to to explain but for
[56:56] instance options markets okay so option
[56:59] markets are coming for the Bitcoin ETFs
[57:03] well there are going to be people that
[57:05] own a lot of Bitcoin or even some
[57:07] Bitcoin that are going to earn a a
[57:10] premium on that Bitcoin by selling
[57:13] covered uh covered cells so there will
[57:16] be a return on there just be aware of
[57:18] the fact that you are putting your
[57:20] Bitcoin at risk in this case maybe
[57:23] you're somebody who wants to sell some
[57:25] Bitcoin at a very high price so you're
[57:27] willing to let that premium rise up
[57:29] until it gets to your price and your
[57:31] bitcoin's gone the other thing is I
[57:34] mentioned uh micro strategy and what's
[57:36] interesting about them is in their
[57:38] last uh quarterly report back in August
[57:43] they announced something that I had not
[57:45] seen before now I've been investing in
[57:48] uh micro strategy for years now and the
[57:51] reason was initially I invested in it it
[57:54] went way up I got nervous I sold it and
[57:58] then it fell down and I always thought
[58:00] to myself well why were you concerned
[58:03] about the ryzen micro strategy it was
[58:05] because I didn't understand what the
[58:07] program was but it became very clear to
[58:09] me as I began to study it that Michael
[58:12] sailor and micro strategy had a game
[58:16] plan of what I call a creative
[58:20] dilution and and I'm not coining this
[58:23] phrase because other people have talked
[58:24] about this but for instance what do most
[58:27] large companies that are sitting on
[58:28] large piles of cash what what do they do
[58:32] United today just announced they're
[58:33] going to uh take out $1.5 billion and
[58:38] they're going to buy back their stock
[58:40] now if you want to United and said hey
[58:43] why don't you issue a billion and a half
[58:45] a stock and put it out there on the
[58:46] market they would laugh at you because
[58:48] they know what would happen to their
[58:50] stock
[58:51] price
[58:52] um what
[58:55] happened you know talking about options
[58:58] and and what could happen in the future
[59:00] what happened to GameStop uh as that
[59:03] stock
[59:04] exploded uh what did they do they issued
[59:07] millions of
[59:08] shares and duded the outstanding shares
[59:13] and stopped that short seller that gamma
[59:17] squeeze basically in a very short period
[59:20] of time you know one thing I will tell
[59:23] you for those people that are going to
[59:25] be on the Insurance side of of these
[59:28] options the people that are selling
[59:30] these options taking premiums they are
[59:33] going to also have a come to Jesus
[59:35] moment when that when Bitcoin starts to
[59:39] accelerate and there's no one no one can
[59:42] issue more Bitcoin stock there's no
[59:45] GameStop that's going to come in here
[59:47] and and put in more Bitcoin stock that's
[59:49] it they are going to see that thing rise
[59:52] and they're going to be forced into the
[59:54] market to purchase more as it continues
[59:55] up up to cover themselves uh we could
[59:59] see even though volatility will probably
[60:02] be suppressed that options become a
[60:03] bigger part of the market we're going to
[60:06] see explosive uh movements but getting
[60:10] back to micro strategy so in this
[60:12] earnings call they said we're going to
[60:16] announce a new metric it was a kpi k
[60:21] that's key performance indicator that's
[60:22] not new but what they said was this is a
[60:26] Bitcoin yield
[60:28] kpi and and here's how they explain it
[60:31] which is something that I understood but
[60:33] they put it in very plain terms our goal
[60:37] is to continue to acquire Bitcoin and we
[60:41] are going to it we're going to acquire
[60:44] it primarily
[60:46] through debt and in their convertible
[60:49] debt Market what do you see you see
[60:51] somebody that is able to acquire $4
[60:53] billion dollar worth of debt at 80 basis
[60:58] points 80 bips that's for viewers that
[61:01] don't understand that's less than 1%
[61:04] interest rate how do they do that and
[61:06] can anybody else do that you can't do
[61:09] that I can't do that no company can do
[61:12] that but but they can and why it's
[61:14] because of that I'm tying this together
[61:16] with the discussion on options too
[61:18] because convertible
[61:21] debt actually increases in value the
[61:25] more vola ility there is with it so
[61:28] bitcoin's volatile they they're
[61:30] acquiring Bitcoin they told us that's
[61:32] our goal and we're going to get more
[61:35] Bitcoin per per share for our
[61:39] shareholders now you put this options
[61:42] trade on top of it and guess what
[61:44] they've got all kinds of liquidity
[61:46] coming in their market now because of
[61:48] this so they've got liquidity there are
[61:50] options these options are like a
[61:54] leveraged Bitcoin
[61:56] call and so that leverage skyrockets and
[62:01] as it does the option becomes worth more
[62:05] and if you know bonds when the bonds
[62:07] worth more the yield that it goes down
[62:09] well guess what their convertible debt
[62:11] is that's why they're able to borrow at
[62:14] these low rates and then they just wash
[62:17] and repeat so in that metric they
[62:20] discuss this but they also discussed
[62:22] guidelines going forward you know
[62:24] they're looking at over the next two
[62:26] quarters a return and I don't know if
[62:30] you want to use interest yield however
[62:34] you want to voice it they're going to
[62:37] have a return projected as high as
[62:40] 8% that means that for every Bitcoin
[62:43] that I have in there now or proxy for
[62:45] the Maxis that means I'm going to have
[62:50] 1.25 Bitcoin in six months for every one
[62:55] of them
[62:56] and there's no reason right now for this
[62:59] to stop so when we talk about yield we
[63:03] talk about interest we talk about return
[63:06] there are there are many things that are
[63:08] happening in our space that that once
[63:11] again just staying up by reading
[63:15] educating yourself are going to help you
[63:17] a lot going forward that's it's super
[63:20] interesting uh never thought about it in
[63:22] in in that way uh really cool um more
[63:27] General when we go into Bitcoin future
[63:31] when we think of like Bitcoin not right
[63:34] now or in the transition phase when you
[63:36] really think about where Bitcoin is
[63:38] going maybe you saw the internet Rising
[63:41] that this P protocol uh that there was a
[63:45] totom bubble and now we at the stage
[63:47] where a lot of people I think I don't
[63:50] know 5 billion people of the 8 billion
[63:52] people on Earth use the internet in some
[63:54] capacities like most most of the people
[63:56] on Earth are uh on the internet in in
[63:59] some capacity when you think about when
[64:03] when do we get to the stage of Bitcoin
[64:06] that be Bitcoin being that mass adopted
[64:11] being that mass adopted in the future um
[64:14] what does that look like how do you
[64:16] foresee uh that happening also do you
[64:18] have some framework of like okay when do
[64:20] you think that that will happen will we
[64:22] get to the point where like almost
[64:24] everyone uses Bitcoin indirectly or
[64:26] directly because I think most people are
[64:28] not aware of like when they send a
[64:30] WhatsApp message that there's like the
[64:32] internet involved in that so like most
[64:34] people don't like I I go on the internet
[64:36] no that they they send a WhatsApp
[64:37] message and I think uh that way also
[64:40] Bitcoin will will spread how do you see
[64:42] Bitcoin in in that really
[64:45] futuristic way in like long term from
[64:48] now well I'll answer the I'll answer the
[64:50] last part first
[64:52] because I think it's going to be a long
[64:54] time I think that we're going to see
[64:57] that level of usage where everything's
[65:01] uh your user interface your UI
[65:03] experience is all beneath whatever it is
[65:06] you're using whether it's an app a
[65:08] hardware device and you don't even think
[65:10] about it you just you know you're
[65:11] sending your emails across the internet
[65:13] so that level I think that's quite a
[65:17] ways away
[65:19] and but the the first part you know the
[65:23] the adoption is happening we have a lot
[65:26] of friction there that is probably going
[65:30] to make adoption more difficult going
[65:33] forward scalability is going to be one
[65:35] of those issues block space is going to
[65:37] be one of those issues now it's nice to
[65:40] see a lot of developers now moving back
[65:43] to the Bitcoin space I think that uh the
[65:47] narrative has changed quite a bit on
[65:49] that and I'm hopeful that we're going to
[65:50] see Solutions coming forward I think
[65:53] fedt was a real a big breakthrough in
[65:56] that too but you know when you think
[66:00] about the average user and the average
[66:03] person and you think about even internet
[66:06] access look at how limited internet
[66:09] access is around the world right now uh
[66:12] we are very privileged look at you and I
[66:15] I mean look at what we're doing here
[66:16] it's it's it's a privilege and most of
[66:19] the world a large portion of the world
[66:22] does not have that you know I can't
[66:24] remember the Fig but a large portion of
[66:26] Africa is without electricity or
[66:30] marginal electricity that's barely you
[66:32] know just spot in spots so there are a
[66:36] lot of there's a lot of friction there
[66:38] um and the other thing is I I'm not sure
[66:42] that you know Bitcoin has all the
[66:45] great facets that any money could have
[66:48] except one but it had it runs rings
[66:51] around everything speaking of fidelity
[66:53] they put out a wonderful chart that
[66:54] lists Bitcoin compared to other assets
[66:58] and as as money as a medium of exchange
[67:01] and Bitcoin is the number one it's in
[67:03] the it's number one in the category
[67:05] except for longevity uh you know we
[67:08] don't have that Millennia of use like
[67:11] say behind gold when we look at how most
[67:13] transactions are occurring in the world
[67:16] they're dollar-based
[67:18] and I you know I I get probably push
[67:21] back from some uh other people in the
[67:24] space but I think the dollar is going to
[67:25] be around for a long time uh if you look
[67:28] at like uh a lot of the hype around the
[67:31] bricks currency and stuff do you know
[67:33] that uh uh in international settlement
[67:37] the Chinese one only accounted for 3%
[67:40] last year
[67:42] 3% so the majority of this settlement
[67:46] that's going on around the world is in
[67:48] dollars and you know I personally
[67:51] Envision a world where dollars are like
[67:55] a [ __ ] coin basically you know they're
[67:58] almost like my for instance when I went
[68:00] down to El Salvador you know I said I
[68:02] told you I haven't spent any Bitcoin but
[68:04] I did down there what I did is I loaded
[68:06] up a wallet uh and just like fill and
[68:10] spend fill and spend so that I could
[68:12] help their economy and keep things
[68:13] moving down there I felt good about it
[68:16] but I almost feel in the future we're
[68:18] going to be viewing dollars like that
[68:21] like I have a certain amount of
[68:22] expenditures per month that is what I'm
[68:25] going to use dollars for or whatever
[68:27] fiat currency there is let's say that
[68:30] I'm let's say that the dollar uh does
[68:33] lose Reserve currency status and we come
[68:36] up with what used to be called the uh in
[68:39] the Breton word uh woods they had a name
[68:42] for the basket it starts with a B I
[68:44] can't remember it right now but that's
[68:46] not important let's just say it's a
[68:48] basket of goods and there's a lot of
[68:50] things in there well maybe that basket
[68:52] of goods will be what I use on my
[68:54] month-to month expens expenditures but
[68:56] what is bitcoin going to be Bitcoin is
[68:58] going to be that
[69:00] that that store of value it's going to
[69:04] be that final settlement layer for me
[69:07] it's going to be my future wealth it's
[69:09] going to be the most important thing
[69:11] that I have because again it is the
[69:14] greatest monetary investment or
[69:18] invention in the history of mankind
[69:21] that's not going away it's just I think
[69:23] the adoption when say it's going to
[69:26] explode over the next six to eight years
[69:29] I'm not talking necessarily about global
[69:31] adoption I just think that all these
[69:33] people that we have been front
[69:35] running they're here and they get it
[69:38] they're smart I mean they call them the
[69:40] smart money for a reason and and they're
[69:44] here they're with us on the platform and
[69:47] they're stepping on the train I love
[69:49] that so much and I had the discussion
[69:51] with rogard Sony and I think it's very
[69:53] insightful uh even if we at like a
[69:56] million doll Bitcoin price I think most
[69:59] people then still don't get Bitcoin I
[70:02] think I think most of the money comes in
[70:04] through institutional money black rock
[70:07] the the big uh B big corporations now
[70:10] with buying Bitcoin uh there's there's
[70:13] literally uh I saw more and more
[70:16] companies now buying Bitcoin and putting
[70:17] on a balance sheet and even like the
[70:18] CEOs talking about that uh on Twitter
[70:21] and I have two interviews just next week
[70:24] lined up with CEOs of really big
[70:26] companies that decided to uh go on a
[70:29] Bitcoin standard and they want to talk
[70:30] about also on the podcast about that so
[70:32] the this Michael sailor micro strategy
[70:34] Playbook is really coming along and if
[70:38] you think about it there has to be just
[70:40] like maybe 10 20 people in the company
[70:42] maybe even less depending on the size to
[70:45] really get Bitcoin to to make that step
[70:47] maybe if it's a big company that has to
[70:49] be way more people involved with that
[70:51] and the board of directors and stuff
[70:52] like that it's way more complicated uh
[70:55] but I think the high prices of Bitcoin
[70:57] we reach even though maybe the masses
[71:00] and the our family gatherings and if you
[71:04] go out on the street and ask like 20
[71:05] people about Bitcoin uh two people maybe
[71:08] know about it so high Bitcoin prices are
[71:11] not correlated directly with the
[71:13] knowledge of Bitcoin in
[71:15] the in the general population at least
[71:18] as I feel about
[71:20] it yeah I I think that you're you're
[71:23] probably spoton right there um
[71:26] you know this idea of also AI you know
[71:31] we're talking about companies well the
[71:34] future really is AI it to my you know to
[71:37] the bit bitcoiners out there if you have
[71:39] not used chat gbt you need to sit down
[71:42] and and do it because it will blow you
[71:45] away uh not just the speed but the
[71:48] indepth analysis the follow on questions
[71:51] that you can do it is an incredible
[71:53] device well you're know you're talking
[71:56] about these CEOs of large companies and
[71:58] Michael sailor his that Playbook that he
[72:00] developed it's not unique to him it
[72:04] could have been copied by other people
[72:06] but there have been things that have
[72:07] holding it back for one thing that fby
[72:09] that I mentioned is one of the biggest
[72:11] issues well that's done January 1 that's
[72:13] over so the other thing is Imagine
[72:17] instead of you have a CEO on the your
[72:19] podcast you have an AI entity let's call
[72:23] him Bob Bob is on the podcast maybe he
[72:26] has an avatar that he wants to put on
[72:27] the screen and what is Bob Bob is the
[72:30] CFO for some real company and this real
[72:33] company has told Bob you know we here's
[72:36] what we're going to do Bob we want to
[72:38] we're going to start a new uh venture
[72:40] capital capital fund or we're going to
[72:42] just start a
[72:44] new uh exploration to see if there's a
[72:48] market segment here and what we want you
[72:50] to do is we're going to give you a
[72:51] budget and we're going to give you a
[72:53] bunch of money and we want you hire
[72:55] people uh we'll give you a you know we
[72:58] want you to rent a space some physical
[73:00] space somewhere of course Bob won't be
[73:02] there except on a screen but you know
[73:04] what Bob can have people meet there he
[73:06] can arrange for purchase orders he can
[73:08] arrange for equipment he can arrange for
[73:11] the internet he's going to start paying
[73:12] the utilities at space Bob the AI is
[73:16] going to start doing all kinds of things
[73:18] and what's he going to
[73:19] need he's going to need money and he's
[73:23] not going to be doing wire transfers
[73:25] he's not going to be using that shitcoin
[73:27] the dollar he's going to be using
[73:29] digital money now I want it to be
[73:33] Bitcoin and for developers I hope that
[73:37] we are that internet based layer to AI
[73:42] we may not be I don't think cbdcs will
[73:45] be it only because there are so
[73:49] many there's so many uh blockades in
[73:53] front of cbdc adoption
[73:55] but what if it's tether oh that's the
[73:58] other thing that I've been playing with
[73:59] on uh that wallet on Aqua wallet is they
[74:03] also have uh tether on there if I didn't
[74:05] mention it so what if tether is that
[74:07] base Le layer you know why do you think
[74:10] tether is so important around the world
[74:12] is because not just Bob the AI but all
[74:16] the populations of the world that are
[74:18] under stress right now because of their
[74:19] currency they want something even if
[74:22] it's tied to the dollar they want
[74:24] something that's better than what they
[74:26] have and that is for many of them
[74:30] usdt um it serves a really important
[74:33] role and uh this AI in the future Bob
[74:39] he's going to be all over and it won't
[74:41] just be the finance officer at some
[74:43] point they'll be independent Bobs and
[74:45] they'll start working with Carol another
[74:49] AI over at some other company or an
[74:53] independent firm and and they're going
[74:55] to be transferring value how are they
[74:58] going to do that it's going to be
[75:00] digital a lot a l the the they are
[75:03] inside here I I I think it's really um
[75:08] we at the cusp of something really good
[75:10] and we of the cusp of something we
[75:12] cannot even really imagine what happens
[75:14] uh it's it's that that big and that hard
[75:16] to imagine they really really cool um I
[75:19] completely overlooked the time we
[75:20] already at over one hour um and I love
[75:23] the uh the discussions already a lot and
[75:27] we definitely have to do a second round
[75:28] on that because this was great till now
[75:32] um we have tin in the podcast where I
[75:34] asked two questions the one question is
[75:36] always the same for each guest and the
[75:37] second is from the previous guest the
[75:40] question that is always the same for
[75:41] each guest is what can we learn from you
[75:44] besides Bitcoin
[75:46] well one of the things is that to never
[75:49] give up I uh you know if you think about
[75:52] the history that I told you you know it
[75:55] it sounds like uh I'm trying to be the
[75:58] most interesting person on in the world
[76:00] that that's not really what I'm saying
[76:03] what I'm really saying is that I didn't
[76:05] know what the hell I wanted to do in
[76:07] life and I kept bouncing around because
[76:10] I couldn't find myself I didn't know
[76:12] where I was and some people would view
[76:14] that as a
[76:15] failure uh and and I have failed at
[76:18] things in life but I just kept going it
[76:22] it like I kept trying and it's so
[76:25] important you know I I had a horrible
[76:27] experience
[76:29] um back in 2004 which I don't really
[76:33] want to discuss it's kind of personal
[76:35] but it it really shook me to the core
[76:38] and there were times when I didn't want
[76:39] to get out of my bed in the morning I
[76:41] would just stay there in my
[76:43] pajamas but I I realized that all I had
[76:46] to do was just get through the next five
[76:48] minutes get through the next day and
[76:51] then finally it was get through the next
[76:53] week and then finally I just kept going
[76:56] so for any of you out there that have
[76:58] ever been in a really bad place you know
[77:01] I offer you hope all you have to do is
[77:05] just keep going I if you'll just take
[77:07] that next step and don't
[77:10] succumb you you never know where you're
[77:13] going to end up I mean look at myself
[77:14] you know I even after my brain injury
[77:17] you know that was a very difficult time
[77:19] I walked around with a little 3x5 card
[77:22] in my pocket and after I was done
[77:25] talking to somebody I would after they
[77:27] left I would pull it out and I'd write
[77:29] down real quick who it was and what I
[77:31] talked about so the next day if I saw
[77:33] them I could remember what it
[77:35] was
[77:37] and but I kept going and so and then
[77:41] look at today you know I I am in a place
[77:44] I couldn't be happier I'm uh you know
[77:47] married to the love of my life uh i' I'm
[77:51] I've got enough in life I'm happy just
[77:54] like J Joseph heler the author of
[77:56] catch22 I can look around and I say you
[77:59] know I've got something that most people
[78:00] don't have I have enough and I just
[78:05] encourage people to really just stay
[78:07] focused on that idea of always there's
[78:11] there's always a tomorrow and just keep
[78:14] going and I guess I guess that's about
[78:17] it for uh just something I would leave
[78:20] people with I I love that a lot and uh
[78:24] we also have the end of the previous
[78:27] guest asking a question for the next
[78:29] guest and it's a similar question
[78:33] actually even though it's differently
[78:34] phrased so maybe you already answered it
[78:37] or but maybe you have something new to
[78:39] add here um the question from the
[78:41] previous guest who asked a question
[78:43] without knowing who who you are um
[78:45] what's your identity besides being a
[78:48] bitcoiner and he asked that question and
[78:51] he asked me to give a little bit context
[78:52] to that question because he thinks
[78:55] Bitcoin will be boring at some point it
[78:57] is right now exciting and there's all
[78:59] those podcasts but he will he said like
[79:02] at some point Bitcoin will be so boring
[79:04] as air as or as the tcpip protocol uh so
[79:08] at some point we have to have an
[79:10] identity besides being a Bitcoin Maxi or
[79:13] besides being a bitcoiner um what is
[79:15] your identity right now besides being a
[79:18] bitcoiner I love this question this is a
[79:21] great question you know um I'm hopeful
[79:24] for the future future in the sense to
[79:25] also that if you if you do what we
[79:28] talked about if you just get Bitcoin get
[79:31] your Bitcoin huddle your Bitcoin don't
[79:34] lose the Bitcoin you are set in life all
[79:38] you have to do is just live your life if
[79:41] you've got a Fiat paying job just do
[79:43] that pay the bills whatever extra you
[79:45] have put into a Bitcoin you know and
[79:49] your wealth will increase I you know
[79:51] I've been in Bitcoin for years my wealth
[79:53] is increasing you know in my
[79:55] neighborhood eight years ago it took 600
[79:57] Bitcoin to buy a house in my
[80:00] neighborhood now in the next four years
[80:03] that same house went up in value and my
[80:06] neighbors were probably thinking oh boy
[80:09] my house went up I'd say it was probably
[80:11] like maybe a hundred grand and guess
[80:14] what my the the Bitcoin that it took for
[80:17] me to purchase that same house was Now
[80:20] 44 Bitcoin so it went from 600 to 44 you
[80:24] know what it is today it's seven Bitcoin
[80:29] to buy that same house so and and
[80:32] coupled in with this question is why I'm
[80:35] I mentioned this because I often post on
[80:40] Twitter basically you need to live your
[80:43] life you've got to do something creative
[80:46] too a and what I mean is there are all
[80:49] kinds of creative arts now obviously I
[80:52] love painting and you know I'm a a a
[80:56] jack of all trades masters of none but
[80:59] except painting I definitely am at a
[81:02] master's level of what I do in art and
[81:05] but you can do something creative in all
[81:08] forms of your life I think that
[81:11] sometimes when I see when I see a
[81:13] plumber come to my house I had one last
[81:16] year I felt like he was a Craftsman like
[81:19] it was a that he was an artist and I I
[81:22] know that sounds silly but the weight
[81:24] that watch him Bend copper pipe and the
[81:26] way he would sweat the joints on it was
[81:29] incredible and when it was done it
[81:31] looked beautiful and I told you I used
[81:33] to love to weld like that Chopper but I
[81:37] would look at somebody who knew what
[81:38] they were doing and I would almost cry
[81:40] to see their
[81:42] weth that's an artist do something
[81:45] creative whether it's creating podcasts
[81:48] whether it's doing writing whether it's
[81:51] just something that you've always wanted
[81:53] to do I highly encourage you to do
[81:57] something creative I I love that so much
[81:59] and uh I
[82:01] wna I just want to put the emphasis on
[82:04] what you just said with the Bitcoin and
[82:06] the and the the real estate also because
[82:08] I think that's something that's really
[82:10] really an inside especially for those
[82:12] people who who still hold a lot of real
[82:14] estate and are still really invested in
[82:17] in in real estate because yes real
[82:19] estate probably will always go up
[82:20] against field currencies but measured in
[82:23] Bitcoin like this 600 bitco coin to
[82:25] seven Bitcoin that's a
[82:28] 98.84% uh uh down for us that that's a
[82:32] complete crash of the real estate market
[82:34] in Bitcoin and and why are people doing
[82:37] that because you know it's been the
[82:39] Playbook over the last decades and if
[82:43] you look at wealthy people what is the
[82:45] one there's one thing that ties most
[82:47] wealthy people together they own real
[82:49] estate they own rental properties they
[82:51] own real estates just a second third
[82:53] fourth there are some that own five
[82:55] homes without a blinking an eye there
[82:58] are people that are using that real
[83:00] estate to try and keep that deflation of
[83:05] their currency they're doing or debasing
[83:08] of their currency doing everything they
[83:09] can to keep their wealth intact well I
[83:12] just told you there's a solution you
[83:14] don't need real estate anymore real
[83:16] estate has so many counterparty risks I
[83:19] know we're close uh to the end of time
[83:21] here but you know if you were to list
[83:25] all the real estate risks they're
[83:27] they're incredible you know you have
[83:30] zoning risks from whether it's the state
[83:34] local Federal zoning risks in the US the
[83:37] federal government came in and said
[83:39] guess what if you're a home if you're a
[83:41] if you are a landlord you can't evict
[83:45] renters they can they can just stop
[83:46] paying you there's risk in uh weather
[83:51] there's risk in insurance premiums
[83:53] there's skyrocketing you know that
[83:54] plumber I just told you about you call
[83:55] that plumber today and guess what he
[83:58] costs twice as much as he did four years
[84:00] ago that's a counterparty risk there's
[84:03] County parter risk there's opportunity
[84:06] cost we haven't even discussed that
[84:08] think about what the opportunity cost is
[84:10] of not owning Bitcoin over the last five
[84:13] years Bitcoin has returned
[84:16] 53% I think 53% that's a hurdle rate
[84:21] that's an opportunity cost go ahead and
[84:23] put your money in real estate
[84:24] but you are missing out I I will'll sa
[84:29] that for another discussion and I also
[84:31] want to talk a little bit about physical
[84:33] security sometime because that's going
[84:35] to change too coming up and there's
[84:38] things that I do to uh protect myself
[84:40] but we'll hold that so uh what else
[84:43] Ramen really cool I love it a lot really
[84:45] cool um the only thing that I need from
[84:48] you before we we go off um where can
[84:50] people find you ask your questions and
[84:52] and reach out to you if they have
[84:53] questions for
[84:55] um you know you can find me on Twitter
[84:58] uh I'm just listed as George Bodin uh I
[85:01] think if you type that in there in fact
[85:03] if you just type my name in Google I
[85:05] think I'm the first thing that comes up
[85:07] uh as an artist or something it lists me
[85:10] but
[85:11] um that that's probably the best way to
[85:13] get in touch now you mentioned a a
[85:16] question do I get to give a question
[85:19] then for the next guest yes uh you get I
[85:23] usually do it offline but if you want
[85:25] you can also do it right now if you have
[85:27] one but I do it off I want to do that
[85:30] because it's something that came up
[85:31] recently I already know my answer but
[85:34] what I'd like to ask the next guest is
[85:36] if you look in the back of the studio
[85:38] I've got a door back there it leads to a
[85:40] changing room for the models so if you
[85:43] knew behind that door that Satoshi was
[85:46] standing there and you would be able to
[85:49] know who he was would you open that door
[85:53] and and
[85:55] followup if you open that door would you
[85:58] tell anybody I love that a
[86:00] lot open it wasi wow I I love that
[86:05] question a lot um it's really really
[86:08] good one uh
[86:10] because I think the mystery and the
[86:14] magical thing about satosi is that we
[86:16] don't know who it is a lot a lot of
[86:18] value that Bitcoin right now has is
[86:21] actually from uh we don't know the
[86:24] there's no one to attack like there's
[86:27] not a single person that anyone can
[86:29] really attack people attack Michael saor
[86:31] people attack individual bitcoiners of
[86:34] course but Michael CER does not speak
[86:36] for Bitcoin nobody speaks for Bitcoin uh
[86:39] the closest figure for that would be
[86:41] satos Nakamoto even though he is now so
[86:44] long away that he even if he reappears
[86:47] probably does not really speak for
[86:49] Bitcoin but I think he would be such an
[86:51] important figure that it was would have
[86:54] kind of appeared that he would he would
[86:56] speak for Bitcoin and there are so many
[86:58] nice documentation with HBO now and then
[87:01] all that trauma around who sat to
[87:03] Nakamoto I honestly like don't even
[87:07] watch that because I I really don't care
[87:09] about about that but it's fun to
[87:11] speculate around it's fun to talk about
[87:13] that uh but yeah it's it's a fun
[87:16] question yeah thank you so much for for
[87:18] for given that to the next guest
[87:21] he spot on really cool than thank you so
[87:24] much um George for being on uh thank you
