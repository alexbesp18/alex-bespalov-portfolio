[00:00] you got no choice right you you're not
[00:01] going to get a 20% a year pay rise
[00:04] working your job you're just not so you
[00:06] think okay well I'm going to invest in
[00:08] this I'm going to buy this I'm going to
[00:09] try this crazy business idea of a mates
[00:12] doing this thing down the power put some
[00:14] money into it and hopefully you're
[00:15] always looking for a return Which is
[00:17] higher than the inflation now of course
[00:19] with Bitcoin it kind of does that for
[00:21] you over time all you have to do is
[00:23] resist the temptation to switch it back
[00:25] to fear we have a much bigger problem
[00:27] with energy distribution because this
[00:30] energy is produced at the wrong time in
[00:32] the wrong place most of the time you
[00:34] know in some ways it's chill out guys
[00:36] because this was going to happen at at
[00:38] the point the asset is recognized for
[00:40] the value it has it's going to
[00:44] [Music]
[00:46] happen hi Jason how you doing everything
[00:49] fine on your end all great Robin it's
[00:51] really good to see you again back back
[00:53] after a year I think it is yeah it's
[00:56] it's it's been already a year and it's
[00:57] it's quite fascinating how much happened
[00:59] in in just one year it's like it's 12
[01:02] months and it almost Fel feels like the
[01:04] development of Bitcoin like three years
[01:06] is is in that 12 months in there yeah
[01:09] absolutely I mean we could imagine I
[01:11] mean where were we we had it was almost
[01:13] it was exactly a year ago I think so
[01:15] ETFs had just been approved uh I mean
[01:18] Trump was nowhere near the White House
[01:20] at the time um and uh we've had what
[01:23] else we've had the Strategic Bitcoin
[01:25] Reserve talked about we've had
[01:27] governments changing their stance or
[01:28] central banks thinking about about um
[01:31] buying Bitcoin I mean it's how did that
[01:34] happen in in just 12 months and and yet
[01:36] here we are having harving yeah and of
[01:39] course I'm Bitcoin touching 109 I think
[01:41] it peaked out um I mean it was crazy
[01:44] talk you know we' said that to us a year
[01:46] ago we would have said I'm not sure
[01:48] that's going to happen but and yet we're
[01:50] here it's super interesting if you
[01:51] actually talk uh okay like exactly one
[01:55] year ago let's say February March last
[01:56] year and we talk okay the president will
[02:00] be will be at Bitcoin conferences they
[02:02] will have a strategic Bitcoin Reserve in
[02:04] the USA at having I mean that's kind of
[02:07] it's kind of predictable uh we will
[02:08] reach over 100k uh and and all those
[02:12] things that that have happened is just
[02:14] just just kind of amazing how how was uh
[02:18] how was that year for you and and how
[02:20] what was kind of your highlight in in
[02:22] that one year well it's a lot been very
[02:25] uh very busy uh I think uh this time
[02:29] last year we talking a bit about mining
[02:31] in the UK we have been um progressing
[02:34] that um and actually we'll talk about
[02:36] that I'm sure a bit later on but uh the
[02:38] last few months also I've been working
[02:39] with um Bitcoin Prague um and I know
[02:42] you're speaking there Robin uh this year
[02:45] so that's going to be fabulous uh uh
[02:47] listening to you um at the event along
[02:50] with some other very big names so you're
[02:52] going to be in a great company but uh
[02:55] yeah I've been working with those guys
[02:56] for a few months just helping out with
[02:58] some of their um content content um as
[03:01] you may know I I I'm prolific writer so
[03:04] I do like to write a lot particularly if
[03:06] I can write about Bitcoin then I'm I'm
[03:08] going to be writing about it so um uh
[03:11] yeah very pleased to um spend a little
[03:14] bit of time working with those guys
[03:15] matus and uh and Martin I mean I mean
[03:18] they know their stuff you know it's such
[03:20] a pleasure working with them it really
[03:21] is and uh yeah so it's been it's been
[03:24] it's been great really cool what are you
[03:27] working with with the guys from from
[03:29] from bit PR obviously like I I really
[03:31] enjoyed the the conference uh I think
[03:34] this episode will already be actually
[03:35] sponsored also from from those guys uh
[03:38] but it's actually my first big Bitcoin
[03:41] conference that I went that's why it's
[03:43] also uh I mean I think I told that story
[03:46] once on the podcast it it's the it's the
[03:48] Pod it's that conference that actually
[03:51] gave me the energy and and that
[03:53] encouragement to go deeper into the
[03:55] Bitcoin uh realm I was already on
[03:58] Twitter a little bit active connected
[04:00] with few people had like 5,000 followers
[04:03] or something like that on Twitter but I
[04:04] didn't had a podcast uh didn't had any
[04:07] uh really connections and um being at
[04:10] that conference made me realize I not
[04:13] only want to spend my money in Bitcoin
[04:15] but I also want to spend my time in
[04:17] Bitcoin uh so it it has it has some
[04:20] special place in in in my heart Bitcoin
[04:22] proct definitely yeah I mean what an
[04:24] endorsement and that's that's exactly
[04:27] the point of it really it is a Bitcoin
[04:28] only conference
[04:30] um it it is um perfectly designed for
[04:33] anyone of all levels and of course you
[04:35] know we've got this extra business day
[04:37] on the first day which you know we're
[04:38] really looking for um Executives
[04:41] decision makers who have kind of heard
[04:43] of Bitcoin still not quite sure how it
[04:45] works within their um company so we're
[04:48] focusing a lot of effort on that this
[04:50] year on on uh the the first day of the
[04:53] conference so um people are in that
[04:55] position um or or even our Bitcoin is in
[04:57] their company they may have had
[04:59] conversations with some of their
[05:01] colleagues and they've looked at them
[05:02] kind of weirdly um which you know we're
[05:05] fairly familiar with even now today um
[05:08] but they don't quite know how to
[05:10] progress talking to uh management senior
[05:13] executiv so we've put these things
[05:16] together um to to help that process
[05:19] along this year so that's something I'm
[05:21] pretty excited about um I've also
[05:25] been as I say as as a writer been sort
[05:28] of producing some material with wrote a
[05:30] book um and just released it just a few
[05:33] weeks a ago called um um from
[05:36] defenestrations to bitcoin um 600e fight
[05:39] for freedom and it was fascinating
[05:42] because researching this book I didn't
[05:44] know a lot of this I mean I knew that
[05:45] you know bip 39 came from Czech Republic
[05:48] so the first ATMs um the first Hardware
[05:51] wallet the first mining pool they all
[05:53] came out of you know Prague and Czech
[05:55] Republic now that bit I knew the bit I
[05:58] didn't know was all the history leading
[06:01] up to it which kind of gives you the
[06:02] context as to why Prague and Czech
[06:06] Republic ended up being this kind of
[06:09] really Forward Thinking um environment
[06:13] for decentralization self Sovereign sry
[06:17] um because it's it's it's kind of in
[06:19] their DNA they've had to fight for this
[06:20] for 600 years through religion and
[06:23] oppression and you know communism uh and
[06:26] so when you go through that I was as
[06:28] fascinated researching it as I was you
[06:30] know ended up writing it with with my
[06:32] colleagues and um I would really
[06:35] recommend it it's a free book actually
[06:36] which we've just um release for anyone
[06:39] to uh to download and and and read it
[06:42] and I I really strongly suggest you do
[06:44] because it's it's fascinating stuff and
[06:45] also it's beautifully laid out I have to
[06:47] say my colleagues um did a brilliant job
[06:49] it looks gorgeous really cool yeah it's
[06:53] they also had isn't the Central Bank of
[06:56] of Czech Republic currently
[06:58] investigating if they should put a
[07:00] Bitcoin on the balance sheet yeah I mean
[07:02] at this stage it's it's it's early days
[07:05] um but there is talk about it and they
[07:06] are examining it and of course we just
[07:08] had the the the three-year capital gains
[07:11] law so um things are changing in the
[07:14] country fast and uh you know we could
[07:16] see prag Czech Republic become sort of
[07:19] some some leaders in this field very
[07:22] much so in the international Arena so I
[07:23] I'd be excited to see that very
[07:25] different from the UK where I am of
[07:27] course where we're very busy going the
[07:29] other other way but um hopefully they'll
[07:31] pay attention absolutely and just a
[07:33] quick note because you mentioned the
[07:35] industry day uh I think that's a day
[07:37] it's kind of underrated for me um
[07:39] because a lot of people say a I'm I
[07:42] don't want to do anything a business I
[07:44] mean if you want to do something with
[07:45] business like the industry day is almost
[07:47] obligation if you go there uh but even
[07:49] for people outside of of that it's a
[07:52] really interesting day because it's a
[07:53] little bit calmer uh and and people are
[07:56] more accessible like on on the other
[07:58] days there's a lot going on there's like
[08:00] a lot of people also there so if you
[08:02] want to be a little bit of a of a calm
[08:04] and a relaxed uh setting I think the
[08:06] industry day is a is an interesting
[08:09] choice like I I was always like I don't
[08:12] like I don't know if I want the industry
[08:13] day and then they gave me a media p i
[08:16] got the industry day also and I was
[08:18] there and I was like oh I actually
[08:19] prefer that day yeah I think a lot of
[08:22] people would think the same way and then
[08:24] find exactly the same because is a is
[08:26] kind of a restricted access day there
[08:28] are fewer tickets
[08:30] on that day far few tickets actually um
[08:33] and that's deliberate because obviously
[08:35] this is a more specific audience it does
[08:37] give everyone who goes a lot more time
[08:39] to go around the Expo so you you get to
[08:41] meet everyone and have a proper
[08:42] conversation with them and of course
[08:44] it's brilliant for networking um because
[08:46] you know um exactly who's there um and
[08:49] this year this is fantastic networking
[08:51] app you can use to interact with anyone
[08:54] um so it's um yeah I I really recommend
[08:57] it um if you can get to that day so cost
[09:00] a little bit more but honestly it's one
[09:01] of those where it's you know it's
[09:03] absolutely worth going and I also like
[09:06] that they have a a five% like it's it's
[09:08] if if you use code Robin as as I as as
[09:11] people he in in the advertisement in the
[09:13] middle of the podcast you can get 10%
[09:14] off but more importantly the the thing
[09:17] is um you get 5% off if you're paying
[09:20] Bitcoin and I like by way yeah that's
[09:23] that's additional yeah I like the idea
[09:27] of I don't know how do how you want to
[09:29] frame it but uh for example Ben of PTC
[09:32] sessions frames it as like he charges a
[09:34] premium for fat
[09:37] uh Bitcoin brag is giving a discount for
[09:39] Bitcoin like however you want to frame
[09:41] it I
[09:42] like I was talking to Ben and and and he
[09:46] said like oh like if if someone wants to
[09:47] partner up with me yes I take dollars
[09:50] but I charge a 15% premium for that it's
[09:53] like yeah you can give me dollars but I
[09:55] don't want to touch that so I I I charge
[09:57] more for that yeah I I think that's the
[10:00] way uh we should think of it and
[10:02] probably increasingly so as the years go
[10:04] by butth yeah prods as usual are there
[10:07] first yeah absolutely um maybe on the
[10:10] topic of of of central banks buying
[10:14] Bitcoin I think last time we actually
[10:16] talked about Salvador quite a bit also
[10:19] uh and now for for some reason already
[10:22] America is is talking about that which
[10:23] completely blew my mind and is is very
[10:25] surprising for me um how do you look at
[10:28] the the game theory aspect currently of
[10:30] uh uh nation states uh interacting with
[10:34] Bitcoin being on a central bank level
[10:36] being on uh strategic Bitcoin Reserve or
[10:39] just like talking about it and there's
[10:41] like the EU there's the UK that might
[10:43] not be as friendly as maybe now America
[10:46] is doing it how do you look at the the
[10:48] whole situation
[10:49] currently well I think we can leave the
[10:51] UK outfit completely for the moment yeah
[10:53] look I mean the word I've people have
[10:55] asked me this question before and the
[10:57] answer I've used is inevitable
[11:00] um I do think it's inevitable that
[11:02] Bitcoin will be part of um reserves uh
[11:06] whether it's alongside gold or or in
[11:09] place of gold I mean that's that's a
[11:11] whole separate debate but I have noticed
[11:13] there been quite a lot of controversy
[11:16] about this particularly from you know
[11:18] sort of libertarian style Bitcoin is
[11:20] saying well you know it used to be about
[11:22] freedom and sovereignty and now we're
[11:24] talking about you know uh Banks and
[11:27] governments using it as uh balance sheet
[11:30] item and you know I've talked about this
[11:33] quite a few times but I I do feel it's
[11:36] kind of irrelevant um you know just
[11:38] because A bank's got gold it doesn't
[11:41] mean you wouldn't own gold um you know
[11:44] it is a commodity they cannot print it
[11:46] they can't create it you know they
[11:48] either got to earn it or or mine it or
[11:51] buy it I mean those are your only
[11:53] options the same as everyone else um so
[11:56] I I don't I really don't buy into these
[11:58] arguments that this has a negative
[12:01] effect overall You could argue that it
[12:03] makes it difficult for the ordinary
[12:04] person to acquire some at a lower price
[12:07] but really that's about it it doesn't
[12:08] stop you using it or doesn't stop you
[12:10] protecting your wealth um so that's the
[12:13] only era I would slightly disagree on
[12:16] with with a lot of people but I do think
[12:19] you know in some ways it's chill out
[12:21] guys because this was going to happen
[12:23] and know at the point the asset is
[12:25] recognized for the value it has it's
[12:28] going to happen uh and we are just right
[12:31] at the beginning of that process now
[12:35] yeah and it's it's the point of like
[12:36] Bitcoin is for everybody and
[12:37] permissionless so like uh um who said
[12:41] that I think Jeff po was it that said um
[12:44] what's the worst thing about Bitcoin and
[12:45] the worst thing about Bitcoin is that
[12:47] even your worst enemy can have Bitcoin
[12:49] like that that's the only bad thing
[12:51] about Bitcoin so if you it's beautiful I
[12:54] mean that's that's that's exactly the
[12:56] point you know there was I tweeted
[12:57] something the other day that someone use
[12:59] Bitcoin in some context and I I I hated
[13:01] the fact that they they use Bitcoin in
[13:03] this particular context but it's just
[13:05] like well tough the day you can start
[13:08] saying what you can and can't use
[13:10] Bitcoin for it loses its value that's
[13:13] that's that's the whole point of it so
[13:16] um you know those applications are
[13:17] changing um all the time and improving
[13:19] all the time uh and some of them we may
[13:21] not agree with but that's that's the
[13:23] beauty of the fundamental asset itself
[13:27] absolutely but but I do get the
[13:29] frustration sometimes uh because I am a
[13:32] big proponent of individuals and
[13:33] families and and those who actually need
[13:35] it get it um but if you look at the
[13:38] facts like retail sometimes sells at at
[13:41] weird times and companies just buy
[13:44] institutions just buy and and they they
[13:46] seem to be some smarter around how to
[13:50] acquire it they're not selling they're
[13:52] just buying they're holding it uh and
[13:54] yes there are like a big cohort of of
[13:56] Bitcoin harders that just like Buy every
[13:59] month a little bit and increase the
[14:01] stack exactly
[14:03] how that's that's amazing but there are
[14:05] a lot of people and I see it all in my
[14:07] comments like oh no I sold Bitcoin today
[14:10] for that altcoin to get a little bit
[14:11] more Bitcoin later and and they're
[14:13] trying to be really fancy with that
[14:15] asset and I'm like no like that that's
[14:17] where retail has no money and the
[14:18] institutions has money because they just
[14:20] buy and hold it and they they get it uh
[14:23] and it's it's kind of frustrating but
[14:25] that's not a Bitcoin mistake that's just
[14:27] human human
[14:29] mistake yeah I mean you know the
[14:31] distribution of of Bitcoin is you know
[14:34] you could argue it's a kind of equitable
[14:36] distribution but it's not necessarily a
[14:38] sort of a fair distribution um because
[14:40] you you could say well the early people
[14:43] got thousands of them I mean that's
[14:45] that's impossible now unless you're a
[14:47] nation or a or an institution and even
[14:50] owning just a handful of them in a few
[14:52] years's time will be very very difficult
[14:54] unless you're a nation or an institution
[14:57] so you can say well you know
[14:59] that's a that's a bit unfair but you're
[15:01] still thinking in terms of kind of fear
[15:03] returns I think you know it doesn't it
[15:05] still it doesn't matter what price
[15:07] Bitcoin is if you're using Bitcoin
[15:09] you're still protecting
[15:11] fundamentally your wealth from devaluing
[15:14] over time through inflation once you
[15:15] make that transition over over to to to
[15:18] that asset and I think that's that's the
[15:21] key point we have all have this kind of
[15:22] fear mindset I I can make more money by
[15:26] buying at this time and selling at this
[15:28] time it's hard
[15:29] to get out of it's really difficult
[15:31] because you kind of programmed um that
[15:34] way but I always think you know look at
[15:35] the broader view of how the asset can be
[15:38] used regardless of price and regardless
[15:40] of how many is owned by a central
[15:43] government somewhere it's interest do
[15:44] you think that I mean uh with feat we
[15:47] have all this this effect of like you if
[15:50] you have more feat it's easier to get
[15:52] more feat uh and with Bitcoin it's it's
[15:55] kind of harder to do that obviously if
[15:57] you have more Bitcoin it's also like uh
[15:59] you have an advantage there but it's not
[16:01] as ingrained as in the Fiat system do
[16:04] you think because of the proof of work
[16:05] system Bitcoin over the long run will
[16:08] just be the best distributed asset uh
[16:11] along along this unfair uh thing that we
[16:15] have in the Fiat system maybe because
[16:17] you can only acquire it with proof of
[16:19] work or like I don't know you spend
[16:21] energy or your your your labor in it and
[16:24] yeah I think the this the the days where
[16:27] we can actually buy Bitcoin with with
[16:29] other money might be be numbered do you
[16:32] think how do you think the distribution
[16:33] will be over the long run with Bitcoin
[16:36] well there's a lot in that question
[16:38] actually um so I mean in terms of
[16:41] distribution uh I think so you know
[16:43] would it be fairer I I I don't know how
[16:47] how that would that would play out I
[16:48] think the point is Bitcoin will always
[16:50] be available somewhere so it doesn't
[16:53] matter where you are it doesn't matter
[16:54] if it's years from now if you want to
[16:56] make the move to to bitcoin you you you
[16:59] can do that um from moving from your
[17:02] fear to bitcoin and then once you're in
[17:04] that fear uh in that Bitcoin environment
[17:06] then it becomes kind of irrelevant what
[17:08] what what fear is is is doing from that
[17:10] point but we might be talking about
[17:11] fractions I've written you know articles
[17:14] on this that we're going to be talking
[17:15] about satoshis in years to come we're
[17:17] not going to be talking about Bitcoin
[17:19] that would be Irrelevant for for most
[17:20] people on a a day-to-day basis um that
[17:23] would be things that you know companies
[17:25] have on their balance sheet it won't be
[17:27] things that that we use um and the other
[17:30] point that you made I think was um this
[17:33] this getting sort of return I suppose on
[17:35] your Bitcoin or always trying to acquire
[17:38] more like you do with fear well don't
[17:41] forget we we we do that with fear
[17:43] because we have to we have to invest
[17:46] because we know our the money we're
[17:48] using is devaluing so fast so everyone
[17:51] becomes invest I think Jack MERS talks
[17:53] about this quite a lot um you know you
[17:56] got no choice right you're not going to
[17:58] get a 20 % a year pay rise working your
[18:01] job you're just not so you think okay
[18:03] well I'm going to invest in this I'm
[18:05] going to buy this I'm going to try this
[18:07] crazy business idea or a mates doing
[18:09] this thing down the P put some money
[18:10] into it and hopefully you're always
[18:12] looking for a return Which is higher
[18:15] than the inflation rate you may not know
[18:16] that's consciously what you're doing but
[18:17] you're always looking for a return
[18:19] that's higher than your uh the inflation
[18:21] rate so you can at least maintain your
[18:24] standard of living now of course with
[18:27] Bitcoin it it does that for you over
[18:31] time all you have to do is resist the
[18:33] temptation to switch it back to fear
[18:36] which most of us fail at some point um
[18:39] to uh to to to to lock in that kind of
[18:43] future security and that's where I
[18:44] believe yourself sovereignty comes in
[18:46] that that Independence away from that
[18:48] fat system that otherwise we are so
[18:50] dependent on um so I hope that makes
[18:53] sense from that point of view yeah
[18:55] absolutely that makes a lot of sense
[18:56] it's also the the the discipline I hope
[19:01] gets better with with people I I noticed
[19:04] myself that uh with Bitcoin I just don't
[19:07] want to spend in it now it's actually
[19:08] getting harder because my income gets
[19:10] more and more into Bitcoin so I I have
[19:13] to spend my Bitcoin not sell but like
[19:15] actually like give give it to someone
[19:17] else uh and and buy things with it just
[19:20] because you have to survive
[19:22] somehow so you do and actually you make
[19:25] it important differentiator there
[19:26] between to sell and spend I mean you
[19:28] you're right you are you're essentially
[19:30] exchanging your your Bitcoin for for
[19:32] fear when you do that um and I'm kind of
[19:34] loosely lumping those th those two
[19:36] things together but um broadly it's
[19:38] about um you know not not you know you
[19:41] think oh it's G up 30% I'll go back to
[19:43] fear well you immediately back in a
[19:45] losing situation again so then youve got
[19:47] to try and make up that Gap over time so
[19:50] uh yeah but it's it's it's still sort of
[19:54] moving from one asset to another and
[19:55] it's also uh and people sometimes don't
[19:59] get that it's like thinking in Sates and
[20:01] thinking of like your net worth in Sates
[20:04] and just trying to increase that number
[20:07] a little bit each month is is the real
[20:10] kind of goal that that you can do with
[20:12] that even if you spend it of like okay
[20:15] like I I'm going to a Bitcoin meet up I
[20:17] want to buy like a a burger with Bitcoin
[20:19] you can do that but the important part
[20:21] is not that you gave away an asset but
[20:23] the point part is that your stack
[20:25] increases each month and you're not
[20:27] selling it for like Fe or you're trying
[20:29] to be fancy with altcoins or like or
[20:32] maybe buy some some other stock with
[20:34] that uh and and I think that's where
[20:36] hopefully Bitcoin gets us back to we're
[20:38] only buying things that are really
[20:40] valuable for us and and we really value
[20:44] those things and we can then live live
[20:46] better with Bitcoin I I hope so at least
[20:49] yeah and it's and it never gets old pain
[20:51] with lightning it just it doesn't uh I
[20:53] mean it's just the buzz of handing the
[20:55] the phone over and seeing those two
[20:56] green ticks like pretty much ins I mean
[20:59] I it's been years I still never gets old
[21:02] for
[21:02] me absolutely um you brought us uh uh
[21:07] some interesting news around uh Bitcoin
[21:09] mining and in UK you said um I'm I'm
[21:12] really interest I think the last time uh
[21:14] we talked about UK and Bitcoin mining
[21:16] was like at least a month or like two
[21:19] months ago I forgot his name I will
[21:22] search it when you when you talked to
[21:24] because he was really good uh on that on
[21:26] the topic also uh what's going on in the
[21:29] UK with with Bitcoin
[21:30] mining the short answer is nothing I
[21:33] mean look you can see you can there are
[21:36] sites you can go to uh where you can
[21:38] track sort of global hash rates by
[21:40] country I mean you got to be slightly
[21:42] careful because we do know that some of
[21:44] these IP addresses which originate have
[21:47] been used you know sent by VPN to those
[21:49] locations so don't expect 100% accuracy
[21:53] and of course people who mining solo
[21:55] mining might necessarily be in there so
[21:58] that said um you you can see these these
[22:01] big numbers from you know America and
[22:04] China where of course it's banned um but
[22:07] it's not really um and then in the UK I
[22:09] think our latest number was
[22:12] 0.25% of global hash rate so
[22:15] 0.25% and we suspect suspect that a lot
[22:19] of that actually is from VPN so we don't
[22:23] even think it's
[22:25] 0.25% this just it just hasn't happened
[22:28] here uh and the reason for that is all
[22:31] to do with uh Power price and the
[22:34] traditional way of thinking of Mining
[22:38] and and if you indulge with a minute
[22:39] I'll just just explain some of the the
[22:41] key differences here which might might
[22:43] might shock you slightly but um so let's
[22:46] take someone like the US okay's let's
[22:49] take Texas right a lot of mining in
[22:51] Texas and they use something uh called
[22:53] nodal pricing that that their system so
[22:57] what that means is you you might have a
[22:58] local power producer who finds a way
[23:02] through combination of renewable energy
[23:04] or or gas flaring or something like that
[23:07] to produce um sorry uh not gas fling gas
[23:10] gas recycling um to um to produce power
[23:14] very very cheaply and then they say
[23:16] right I'm going to sell this power at
[23:18] two three four cents a kilowatt hour uh
[23:22] so if you're a miner you can say great
[23:24] I'll what I'll do is I I'll roll in and
[23:26] I'll set up an operation here uh here's
[23:29] a what we call a power purchase
[23:31] agreement a PPA uh we will buy that
[23:33] power at this price and you'll produce
[23:36] it get paid and we'll produce our
[23:38] Bitcoin and we'll generate our revenues
[23:41] um that way so that's kind of
[23:44] traditional mining if you like and how
[23:47] you know lots of countries work on on on
[23:49] this basis in some form or
[23:51] another now let's have a look at the UK
[23:54] what have we decided to do in the UK
[23:57] what we've decided to do is completely
[24:00] ignore any kind of nodal pricing or
[24:02] zonal pricing and we have a single price
[24:06] for the entire
[24:07] country right and coincidentally we also
[24:12] have highest electricity prices in the
[24:16] world um so um I don't know if those two
[24:19] things are linked but you draw your own
[24:22] conclusions um so and we also have a
[24:24] rather bizarre system um because we do
[24:28] have quite a lot of renewable energy in
[24:30] the UK I mean we don't actually so much
[24:33] have a problem with energy production we
[24:36] have a much bigger problem with energy
[24:38] distribution because this energy is
[24:41] produced at the wrong time in the wrong
[24:44] place most of the time so and it's quite
[24:46] hard to transport it around we don't
[24:48] have a lot of the infrastructure for
[24:50] that so you think oh that's great
[24:52] because you've got all this excess
[24:54] energy we could we we could we could use
[24:57] that right for um Bitcoin money because
[24:59] it can't get to where it is well yes but
[25:04] then you come back to this pricing issue
[25:06] right so we have this this this strange
[25:08] thing called marginal pricing in the UK
[25:11] and grids are difficult to balance so
[25:14] you've constantly got a Balance power in
[25:16] power I mean it's it's it's a hell of a
[25:18] job I wouldn't like to try and do it but
[25:20] obviously this is what these guys do so
[25:22] he has to stay at a certain level very
[25:24] tight range of power into to power out
[25:27] so you can imagine everyone one turning
[25:28] all their appliances on and off and the
[25:30] power going up and down from all these
[25:32] different sources particularly renewable
[25:35] um it it gets very difficult and what
[25:37] the National Grid do is every 30 minutes
[25:39] essentially they sort of say right this
[25:41] is the power expectation and you can bid
[25:43] in to provide that power uh and and of
[25:47] course all these people there's a
[25:49] mechanism for this there's a big market
[25:51] for it it's it's fast and automated
[25:54] semi-automated and um these people bid
[25:57] in to provide that
[25:59] power and what that sounds great because
[26:02] obviously you've got some cheaper power
[26:03] units in there uh and you think well
[26:05] that's great you just sell it to the to
[26:07] the lowest bidder right I mean that that
[26:10] just that just makes sense that's the
[26:11] cheapest power but they make get the
[26:14] agreement they may get that contract for
[26:16] the 30
[26:17] minutes um but or the ability to provide
[26:20] that power for 30 minutes um but it's
[26:23] actually paid at the price that the last
[26:27] unit of electricity was produced that
[26:29] from the highest uh producing plant so
[26:31] the most expensive
[26:33] plant which sounds odd right so that
[26:36] plant is almost always gas because
[26:37] that's our
[26:38] backup and I think a guy called Dr
[26:41] Andrew Crossland you probably should
[26:42] look up his letter actually it's quite
[26:44] interesting did a great analogy of this
[26:45] because I don't think I've done a great
[26:47] job of explaining that actually but
[26:48] think of it this way let's say you go to
[26:50] the supermarket and you buy a sandwich
[26:53] for a pound and you buy a drink for3
[26:57] pound and you know you buy yourself a
[27:00] nice expensive bottle of wine for
[27:02] £25 right so your bill comes to uh
[27:07] 229 now under the UK electricity system
[27:11] your bill would come to
[27:13] £75 because you pay the highest item
[27:16] over the other two items all right
[27:19] that's how it works and that's why we
[27:21] end up with this um kind of crazy single
[27:25] pricing system and there are reasons for
[27:26] it don't get me wrong there was there
[27:28] was thinking behind it but the point is
[27:30] it doesn't end up going to the consumer
[27:32] at the end of the day and we're stuck in
[27:35] this kind of strange um kind of Twilight
[27:38] Zone pricing system when you look at it
[27:41] objectively you still with me so far on
[27:43] this Robin it's it's so it's it's
[27:46] basically a a free market Interruption
[27:50] uh which makes the energy prices way
[27:53] higher than they should be if I
[27:54] understand it correctly yeah sort of I
[27:56] mean I I have simplified it a bit
[27:57] because the ra there are special
[27:58] agreements that some of the renewable
[28:00] energy um uh um um operators have um so
[28:05] it is in in in some ways a
[28:08] simplification
[28:10] but the net effect is you end up with
[28:12] this high price and and the thinking
[28:14] behind it was well look if we pay these
[28:17] guys more they'll create more cheaper
[28:20] renewable energy right so there was
[28:22] there was some logic behind this
[28:24] happening but you know the net effect as
[28:26] say the other end is the consumer
[28:27] doesn't get that that discounted price
[28:30] there is pressure in the UK to change
[28:31] this there are there is some awareness
[28:33] about this now I think Boris Johnson was
[28:36] famously quoted saying it was Madness or
[28:38] something like that um set up a
[28:40] commission to look at it so but this
[28:42] sort of thing takes years to change and
[28:44] it will take years to change and that's
[28:47] part of the problem for money there are
[28:48] other ones but that that's that's a key
[28:50] one let's take a break for a moment and
[28:52] appreciate the puty that coin vigilante
[28:56] has made with the Bitcoin watch es those
[28:59] watches are the most amazing the most
[29:01] elegent way of showing that you are a
[29:04] true bitcoiner and coin vigilante just
[29:07] dropped a completely new and amazing
[29:10] Genesis edition of their watch
[29:13] collections you have the date of the
[29:15] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[29:18] and of course also the block height and
[29:21] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[29:24] level of detail they put in in this
[29:27] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[29:29] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[29:33] in the descriptions I love those watches
[29:35] so so much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[29:39] really do hope that you don't have it on
[29:41] Exchange but if you do have it on
[29:43] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[29:45] with that the first way is you put it on
[29:47] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[29:50] you to get into the self- custody game I
[29:53] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[29:56] for that it's a super simple and secure
[29:59] way and if you check out the link in the
[30:02] description you even get 5% off if you
[30:04] use the code Robin and the second way is
[30:07] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[30:11] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[30:14] most out of your sovereignty they will
[30:17] personalize for you a self custody setup
[30:20] that is perfect for your individual
[30:23] situation they will show you how you can
[30:25] secure your own devices securing your
[30:28] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[30:30] keep all your devices secure one topic
[30:33] that is overlooked often is the
[30:35] inheritance plan what happens with your
[30:38] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[30:41] you have a plan for that in place
[30:43] already and last but not least if you're
[30:45] in a jurisdictions where you don't feel
[30:48] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[30:51] that head over do the Bitcoin way.com
[30:54] robobin to get a 30 minute free C all
[30:58] and just a quick side note I will be for
[31:01] the first time ever speaking at the
[31:03] Bitcoin Prague event in June it will be
[31:06] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[31:08] looking forward to seeing all of you
[31:10] there you can get your ticket in the
[31:13] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[31:15] Brock and very important use code Robin
[31:18] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[31:21] looking forward seeing you there is is
[31:23] it in general from the UK I currently
[31:27] don't hear anything positive so like I I
[31:30] I don't uh actively research because
[31:32] it's it's it's not a country that I'm
[31:33] looking to like go there any anytime
[31:36] soon but uh I hear that they uh get
[31:39] people in prison when they tweet about
[31:41] things I don't know how much how much
[31:44] truth there there is also um I hear that
[31:47] uh bitcoiners are trying to move away
[31:49] from from there so like any anytime UK
[31:52] comes up in like a Bitcoin of Freedom
[31:54] context I I only hear bad news yeah we
[31:57] we not s
[31:58] us with Bitcoin freedom and and you know
[32:01] that's a whole different conversation
[32:03] about tweets and other stuff that's
[32:04] going on here we we've we've have
[32:06] created a lot of problems for ourselves
[32:09] over the last U particularly the last
[32:12] decade uh and it's accelerated since Co
[32:15] I mean a lot of countries have had
[32:17] problems um since then we seem to excel
[32:20] at them at the moment and um and it's
[32:23] it's it's quite depressing actually just
[32:26] to to see what's going on but uh don't
[32:28] get me started on that because we will
[32:30] be here all day I I I get that yeah um
[32:34] but but you're not you're not looking at
[32:36] uh you're currently in the UK living and
[32:38] you're not looking at moving out of the
[32:41] UK well it's interesting you say that
[32:43] because um you know
[32:46] I I years if you ask me even probably a
[32:49] couple years ago I would say no you in
[32:52] my my home country I've I've traveled
[32:54] fairly
[32:55] extensively um my uh my wife actually
[32:57] actually lived in Canada for 5 years and
[33:00] i' I've been abroad for um extended
[33:03] periods and I I I do love traveling
[33:05] visiting other countries but I always
[33:06] had this thing I wanted to be back in
[33:09] England you know that's my country proud
[33:11] British etc etc and it's only in the
[33:14] last sort of six months to a year where
[33:16] I've really started to genuinely
[33:18] question that and think about okay well
[33:22] you know which countries would we we'd
[33:24] like to live in and there is a short
[33:26] list of countries that we we'd like to
[33:28] live it um but where it was an
[33:30] impossibility it's now become a
[33:33] possibility not not a high possibility
[33:36] but it's um something now that is on the
[33:38] radar that was never there before uh and
[33:41] that is a direct result of um some of
[33:43] the issues I've been seeing here in the
[33:46] UK how is it uh with Bitcoin current in
[33:49] the UK I know uh I think two people were
[33:52] on my podcast talking about the UK
[33:54] Bitcoin policy uh the that uh group um H
[33:59] how good is it in in the UK with with
[34:01] Bitcoin well you use the word good so um
[34:04] there there's your first problem right
[34:07] we have uh we have a government who are
[34:09] actively ignoring it um currently I mean
[34:13] actively ignoring it now to be fair the
[34:15] last government um did as well so this
[34:17] is this is nothing new um the guys
[34:20] you're talking about Bitcoin policy UK
[34:22] um I mean that's Freddy and you I know
[34:23] you've had Freddy on your show um and
[34:26] he's fantastic guy really knows his
[34:29] stuff um o over here and of course Susie
[34:31] fet Ward as well they run BP UK uh and
[34:36] they they've got quite a big task ahead
[34:38] of them they're effectively volunteering
[34:40] it's a kind of I suppose not for-profit
[34:42] organization I guess as the best way to
[34:44] uh describe it but they're they're
[34:46] really there to educate to try and put
[34:49] some um pressure maybe the wrong word
[34:52] but sort of you keep whispering in the
[34:53] politicians ears um to have a look at
[34:56] this have a look at that because here's
[34:58] the reasons here's some research to
[35:00] support it um obviously I spent a lot of
[35:03] my time tweeting and tagging you know
[35:06] Rachel Reeves our chance when things
[35:08] come up I know there's people like
[35:09] hashley Giles um on Twitter I think who
[35:12] send uh a tweet to um uh miliband every
[35:16] day that's our enery guy uh just saying
[35:18] hey look at the Bitcoin you could have
[35:19] mined um with all this excess energy
[35:22] that we're wasting so you know we are we
[35:24] are poking it and particularly BP UK uh
[35:27] spent a lot of time poking this um but
[35:30] at the moment the message is very much
[35:32] look you know talk to the hand we just
[35:35] we're not we're not even going to engage
[35:37] in this conversation currently but that
[35:41] doesn't mean we we should stop uh we we
[35:43] need to carry on those
[35:45] conversations amazing and they are great
[35:47] people uh I I just uh because we
[35:50] mentioned so many already uh I will just
[35:52] quickly show that um I the first one
[35:56] that I talked about where I couldn't
[35:58] remember the name was Nick actually oh
[36:00] Nick yeah yeah we we talked about uh
[36:02] Bitcoin mining but also like the the
[36:05] Bitcoin overall feces and he has a great
[36:09] great thing with like the uh stabilizing
[36:12] Freddy was on uh that that was also
[36:14] amazing talking with him and actually
[36:17] you mentioned Susie she was actually
[36:18] also on uh on on the show and and I
[36:21] think those those are amazing people so
[36:22] I I I I keep meeting really really cool
[36:26] people from from the UK and and from
[36:28] like starting from like Adam back to
[36:30] like everyone uh that that is known also
[36:33] in in the Bitcoin feere that is from the
[36:34] UK the really great uh people and do you
[36:38] think something like because USA was
[36:40] also kind of hostile in in some regards
[36:43] before Trump um with like uh the the the
[36:47] open source people and and and and
[36:49] trying to imprison them and stuff like
[36:51] that um do you think a similar change
[36:55] that is now in the US USA is possible
[36:57] also in in in the
[36:59] UK it's
[37:01] possible um I don't think um it's going
[37:03] to happen anytime soon I think it will
[37:06] require a change of government or
[37:07] Personnel or or just a change in
[37:09] thinking but you know it's
[37:12] possible that um the USA looking at
[37:14] strategic Bitcoin Reserve has has has at
[37:17] least turned some heads if nothing else
[37:20] um but you know Trump in some ways is is
[37:23] not the best Advocate I don't if you if
[37:26] you watched him signing the Bitcoin
[37:28] strategic Reserve but he he followed up
[37:30] didn't he with that it looked very
[37:32] half-hearted he didn't really understand
[37:34] what he was signing and then he made
[37:36] that comment you know never SE your
[37:38] Bitcoin so they say who the hell knows I
[37:41] mean it's hardly an endorsement of of of
[37:45] where we are and I do think that that
[37:47] didn't help um he kind of missed an
[37:49] opportunity there because he simply
[37:50] doesn't really understand it yet but
[37:52] other people around him do I mean
[37:55] Senator Lumis obviously she she
[37:56] understands what's going on she's
[37:58] putting uh her her bill forward Michael
[38:01] saor clearly hopefully has the year of
[38:03] some of these guys um and and can have
[38:05] an impact um but those sort of things
[38:09] they're great but they're still at a
[38:10] very early stage because there's a whole
[38:12] load of stuff we got to go through I
[38:14] mean we might even see um the US do more
[38:17] [ __ ] coining first before they you know
[38:19] the traditional route that we all follow
[38:20] right before they really going into the
[38:22] Bitcoin side it's arguably they've done
[38:25] some of this but um
[38:27] it's um there's a lot there's a lot to
[38:30] happen before there's real Clarity there
[38:32] oh I should mention Dennis Porter as
[38:33] well of course you know with the work
[38:35] he's doing uh because he that man is
[38:37] Relentless um he just will not stop
[38:40] until this happens so I think once one
[38:42] of those converts maybe we'll see some
[38:45] action elsewhere I still don't think it'
[38:46] be from the UK I think it be another
[38:48] country uh and then that might be enough
[38:51] to you know urge the UK to at least have
[38:53] a look at this yeah and and I think the
[38:57] big biggest positive thing that I get
[38:59] away from Trump is now that he
[39:02] acknowledges that he has to be for it
[39:05] and that not against it because there's
[39:07] an important voting block behind it I I
[39:09] think that's that's the extent I mean I
[39:12] have no clue but that I think that's the
[39:14] extent that he understands it of like
[39:17] okay I benefit more from being for it
[39:20] versus being against it because there's
[39:21] like a very important voting block that
[39:24] also coincides with my general voting
[39:26] block of the Republic in Freedom
[39:28] Movement uh so and and I do agree it was
[39:31] really funny that the video where he
[39:33] signed it and where he was asking like
[39:34] and you think that as good
[39:37] idea it was so bizarre it was like is
[39:40] this a good idea so I just thought yeah
[39:41] why not I'll just do it and then you
[39:43] know it's not really I don't think how
[39:46] executive orders are supposed to be
[39:47] signed um but um but but anyway let's
[39:51] let's maybe get back to the UK because
[39:54] uh uh there some you know there are some
[39:58] some things happening here I think which
[39:59] are which are which are interesting
[40:02] really just just was want to mentioned
[40:05] that it's super funny with with Trump I
[40:08] I saw that I was like I don't know if
[40:10] that's
[40:13] positive a few of us have definitely had
[40:15] that that same reaction I think that's
[40:17] part of the reason why markets reacted
[40:19] as they did because people like it's
[40:20] good right you know that was there was
[40:23] no you know no certainty there really
[40:26] and that the dinner later I think this
[40:28] was like a day later or two days later
[40:30] where where saor was at the dinner and
[40:33] uh I was so disappointed I watched it
[40:35] live it was like 10 11 p.m. uh in in my
[40:40] in in in the Austrian time zone and I
[40:42] watched and I was like I was so
[40:44] disappointed that saor did not speak and
[40:46] he actually uh right at the end he said
[40:48] like oh yeah I want to speak and then he
[40:51] gave they gave the word to someone else
[40:52] and then Trump just ended the thing and
[40:55] I was like ah come on I want I miss that
[40:58] part oh wow oh dear idea yeah but it's
[41:02] uh but let's go come back to the uh UK
[41:04] you said there are some interesting
[41:05] things yeah yeah I mean um yeah we can't
[41:08] a bit of a detail there but we're just
[41:10] we're talking about the energy side and
[41:12] the um you know why we we can't mine in
[41:14] the UK or on the face of it you can't
[41:16] mine and that's that's the traditional
[41:18] um thinking and there have been a couple
[41:20] of companies that have tried to mine in
[41:22] the UK and they've looked for you know
[41:24] stranded energy wasted energy to do it
[41:26] because the numbers are are staggering
[41:29] actually um yeah we spend about a
[41:31] billion pounds a year billion pounds a
[41:34] year being
[41:36] energy now what that means is you
[41:38] there's two wind farms in particular in
[41:40] the UK very guilty of this a massive
[41:42] wind farms uh and they Cel they are
[41:45] ciled around 60% of the time now that
[41:48] means they only produce energy 40% of
[41:50] the time but they're paid for the whole
[41:52] lot as if they were producing so that's
[41:54] when you know when you see a wind
[41:55] turbine it's not turning you think
[41:57] thinking it's windy day why why is why
[41:59] is that not turning uh it's either you
[42:02] know under repair or more likely it's
[42:04] been curtailed so um they either stop it
[42:07] in low winds or turn the blades to a
[42:09] very specific angle into the wind so it
[42:11] turns extremely slowly doesn't produce
[42:14] very much power uh but they're still
[42:16] paid as if the power is being produced
[42:19] because that's the terms of the
[42:21] contract um and then someone's going to
[42:23] pay for that and that's goes on our
[42:26] electricity bill
[42:27] and and so all that money then we pay us
[42:30] as end consumers businesses and
[42:32] individuals pay pay for
[42:35] thatment so we have this strange M
[42:37] mismatch right so we got this really
[42:39] high energy power and about a billion
[42:42] pounds worth of power we wasting a year
[42:44] and that's projected by the way to
[42:46] increase and actually some prices and
[42:48] some Ras will go negative um because
[42:51] we're overproducing so much power just
[42:53] paying people to take it away
[42:55] effectively
[42:57] so how do you match all of those things
[43:01] up particularly on a on a big scale and
[43:03] particularly if you're still thinking of
[43:05] a kind of traditional model this kind of
[43:07] PPA power purchase agreement model it
[43:09] doesn't doesn't really work so when we
[43:12] started renew blocks was actually my
[43:14] colleague Callum wheeler who started I
[43:15] came along slightly later uh we went
[43:19] down the traditional route of looking at
[43:22] we we find this NG we sign an agreement
[43:24] we we mind that way and we did what the
[43:26] other companies do we spent a lot of
[43:28] time going around realize actually this
[43:30] is this is quite difficult even when
[43:32] you're speaking to power operators
[43:34] directly they can generally sell Power
[43:36] at a higher rate to the grid through
[43:38] things called feed tariffs so that's
[43:41] that's tricky to do it's not really
[43:42] going to work so we went back to the
[43:44] drawing board we really did take the
[43:46] long way around on this uh went back to
[43:48] the drawing board and said right how can
[43:50] we think about this differently UK
[43:52] obviously needs a different approach so
[43:55] we came up with the idea of turning
[43:56] money on its head so what if mining is
[43:59] not the primary output what if the
[44:02] primary output is heat for example
[44:06] remember all power that goes into minus
[44:08] is basically converted to heat what if
[44:10] we were to use the asset as a market
[44:14] asset so we can use that asset uh in
[44:17] What's called the ancillary Services
[44:19] market so we can use it specifically to
[44:23] balance grid take excess loads um
[44:27] respond to frequency modulations uh
[44:29] there are other types of markets
[44:31] actually I can't remember what they are
[44:32] off the top of my head but then we turn
[44:34] it into a different way of doing it your
[44:36] byproduct is your Bitcoin
[44:39] mining okay so it's now the other way
[44:42] around so primarily our job is to
[44:43] balance the grid so the the asset is
[44:46] designed specifically for that purpose
[44:49] which allows us to take part in these
[44:50] ancillary markets and Bitcoin mining is
[44:53] kind of the side effect of of of doing
[44:55] that what would that look like so we
[44:58] thought well that sounds cool let's
[45:00] let's check it out and then we
[45:01] discovered just how complex the energy
[45:03] markets are uh then we just got
[45:06] discovered how closed they are um and
[45:09] it's it's one of those things if you
[45:12] knew how difficult it was you would
[45:13] never start you know but we we kind of
[45:16] we ended up in that position so once we
[45:19] flipped it on his head and we thought
[45:21] right well that's the ankle we approach
[45:22] we'll use now so it means a whole
[45:25] different set of questions now you can
[45:26] deal with energy operators and energy
[45:28] consumers as well um now we have a
[45:32] different way of of of a different
[45:35] conversation to have and that then led
[45:37] to suddenly we had doors open all over
[45:39] the place so now we've got multiple
[45:42] projects in the UK uh which are either
[45:45] early stages of exploration or or quite
[45:48] you along down the road into getting
[45:50] quite close to actually possible
[45:53] deployment um and and in fact we're
[45:56] taking trip up to Scotland I think it's
[45:57] next week or the week after we've got
[45:59] several sites three or four sites that
[46:01] we're going to to scout in one one trip
[46:04] um and so once once we've made that
[46:07] change it we now realize it's possible
[46:09] it's very difficult and it's taken us a
[46:11] long time we've had to build a lot of
[46:13] Partnerships to do it but we now know it
[46:15] can be done interesting and it's the the
[46:20] the crit stabilizing aspect of mining
[46:24] seems to be a no prer even if you hate
[46:27] [Music]
[46:29] Bitcoin and you brilliant Point rob you
[46:32] kind of hit the nail on the head in some
[46:33] ways I me you know we learned this you
[46:35] know we would go to an NG person and say
[46:37] Hey you know you can sell us the pan you
[46:39] can do Bitcoin mining and they either
[46:41] look at you like what or uh I don't want
[46:43] to get involved with that these guys
[46:45] have no idea about Bitcoin right you
[46:48] know most people still don't so then you
[46:51] have to have this whole discussion uh
[46:53] and of course you can't do it quickly it
[46:55] takes us all quite a while to really get
[46:57] our heads around this so we thought okay
[46:59] well let's let's forget all that we say
[47:01] right we will we will be there we will
[47:03] provide the service we can maybe you
[47:05] know on your site using part of your
[47:08] connection uh with your import tariff we
[47:10] could we could pay you a rent uh we can
[47:13] we can we can and then trade on the
[47:15] ancillary markets with with with that
[47:17] asset uh but we'll be mining as well but
[47:20] that's kind of in the background we're a
[47:21] data center um you know we don't need to
[47:23] worry about any of that so that's that's
[47:25] much easier conversation to have because
[47:27] you're now just talking about a business
[47:30] model that they understand yeah it's AB
[47:32] it's it's um I talked with a few people
[47:35] already around that and I think uh
[47:38] putting Bitcoin mining as like as as
[47:41] much in the background as possible uh
[47:43] and just the technology advancement for
[47:46] that uh of like hey we can balance the
[47:48] grid and it's just like a container and
[47:50] you just just plug it in and you don't
[47:53] even have to worry what's in the in the
[47:54] container you're just like if you have
[47:57] over excess energy just put it in there
[47:59] if you don't you don't like it it can
[48:02] run whenever it can run I think it it
[48:05] makes a lot of sense and I even talk
[48:06] with some Austrian people they do it
[48:08] also with the government here they uh
[48:11] have the boxes up and running and for
[48:13] like 30 or 60 minutes a day they they
[48:16] run the Bitcoin Miners and the rest of
[48:18] the day it's just stand still it's just
[48:20] there for when the git needs it and if
[48:23] it's not running it's not running it's
[48:25] not a problem and I think that's the
[48:27] huge advantage of like being able to
[48:29] just turn it on and off again uh and you
[48:31] can really monetize it uh effectively uh
[48:35] which works way better I think than uh
[48:38] with AI or like other data centers
[48:41] because you can't do it with those you
[48:42] can't part part of its latency you know
[48:44] because they can't locate in very rural
[48:46] areas and you just can't shut down these
[48:48] operations you know they need an
[48:49] enormous backup um so I mean the closest
[48:53] analogy is
[48:55] battery uh because you know the
[48:57] batteries can can can take that power
[49:00] but they can only take so much power and
[49:02] they have to discharge a certain point
[49:05] so that doesn't always work where you've
[49:07] got a lot of excess energy because you
[49:09] got no chance to discharge it back to
[49:11] the grid so that solves that problem as
[49:13] well that's kind of why Scotland's
[49:15] particularly interesting because the the
[49:17] there is a a unique situation up there
[49:20] with along those lines interesting yeah
[49:23] the the the so Ai and in other data and
[49:27] is not even possible so I always thought
[49:30] it's it's way better with Bitcoin but I
[49:32] was with Bitcoin there is no other
[49:34] interest I mean I I I challenge you Rob
[49:36] can you think of an industry that you
[49:38] can location agnostic has that
[49:40] flexibility and load that you can turn
[49:43] on and off and it's not uh essential to
[49:46] what he's actually doing no actually not
[49:50] yeah you you you with AI data centers
[49:54] and other things you you need the the
[49:57] you cannot just turn it off you need
[49:59] backups you need the latency it makes a
[50:01] lot of sense I never thought about that
[50:02] actually I always thought like Bitcoin
[50:04] is way superior but I never thought
[50:06] that's so much Superior that it's
[50:08] actually the only thing yeah I mean
[50:10] that's why I I tagline is renew blocks
[50:12] you know flexible Bitcoin mining because
[50:15] you know once once you sort of step back
[50:17] and look at it in a broad sense it's
[50:19] like wow this is an extremely versatile
[50:22] service that can be applied in a whole
[50:24] load of different ways once you get out
[50:26] of that mindset of PPA mining uh it
[50:29] opens all of these these doors and it
[50:32] did take us a while to figure that out
[50:34] to be honest with you but um and it's
[50:36] Tak us even longer to get to the point
[50:37] we can execute it um but uh you know
[50:40] we'll get to the stage um where we are
[50:42] now we'll be going through our first
[50:44] funding proper funding raise round uh
[50:46] very shortly actually uh and um and we
[50:50] when we need to do it fairly quickly
[50:51] because we actually have several
[50:52] projects we could deploy now so um uh so
[50:56] yes it's it's it's starting to get um a
[50:59] little bit busy over here really cool I
[51:02] I like to see that it's also great to
[51:03] see the the progress of of the companies
[51:06] uh that uh the guests of my podcast are
[51:09] involved uh it's already yesterday I was
[51:12] also talking with someone that return on
[51:14] the the podcast it's just amazing to see
[51:16] all those projects and and and making
[51:18] that going forward uh I will do that
[51:20] podcast the rest of my life probably the
[51:23] next 5 10 years on the Bitcoin topic
[51:24] will be amazing to see this the do M
[51:26] mentation on on not only the people but
[51:28] also what what the people are working on
[51:31] the projects I I really liked it in the
[51:33] first year yeah I mean what an industry
[51:35] to be at and what a time to be uh alive
[51:39] I find it tremendously exciting because
[51:41] I I like you I love to see these
[51:43] breakthroughs I particularly like it
[51:45] when someone comes up with something
[51:46] that I'd never even thought of uh and
[51:49] someone's come with this great
[51:50] application I think runs on bitcoin and
[51:52] the best ones of course are the ones
[51:53] that as soon as they say it you think
[51:55] well now that's really obvious Why did
[51:57] no one think of doing this or doing that
[52:00] and and I love those ideas uh and I I
[52:03] suspect we probably haven't even seen
[52:05] the best ones yet uh and that's that's
[52:07] that's the really cool thing about this
[52:09] I think over the next three four years
[52:10] we will see things we haven't even uh uh
[52:14] imagined and in fact good analogy for
[52:16] you I was I was heavily involved with
[52:18] the internet in the
[52:19] 90s as it was being um uh developed my
[52:23] side was kind of talking to people about
[52:25] adoption and education
[52:27] in the UK of the internet which was
[52:28] quite negative fun enough at the time
[52:31] and we were thinking wow one day you'll
[52:32] be able to you might be able to download
[52:34] a movie uh which just seemed completely
[52:37] alien at the time and nobody thought of
[52:39] things like Airbnb or Uber or all these
[52:44] completely crazy applications uh that
[52:47] you can do now and I I think we'll see
[52:49] the same uh with Bitcoin so I think
[52:51] we're probably coming up to the download
[52:53] of movie stage maybe uh and we're going
[52:56] to see you know that that generation of
[52:59] of development and adoption uh that's
[53:01] going to lead to to all sorts of things
[53:03] we don't even know about yeah and that's
[53:06] why it's so exciting to talk about that
[53:08] because we we don't know what we don't
[53:10] know exactly that's exactly the Casual
[53:13] we Falls in yeah yeah but I'm very keen
[53:15] to find out absolutely really cool um I
[53:19] I'm also really fascinated currently
[53:21] with with the topic of Bitcoin companies
[53:23] and the adoption on on the institution
[53:25] SI I don't know how much how much you
[53:27] you dig into that um obviously we had
[53:29] the ETF last year I think we also last
[53:31] time talked a little bit about the ETF
[53:33] but more importantly actually talked
[53:35] yesterday had an inperson podcast
[53:37] actually in Austria with uh the oldest
[53:41] Bitcoin exchange in Austria and he's the
[53:44] the main guy when it comes to uh
[53:46] businesses buying Bitcoin and and I
[53:49] talked with him on the record and off
[53:51] the Record a lot uh and in he had some
[53:54] crazy stories and he said 80 or 90% of
[53:58] the companies he talks to he has to sign
[54:01] an agreement to not talk about that they
[54:02] have Bitcoin so he's like there's an
[54:05] outstanding amount of companies in the
[54:07] German speaking area that we all know
[54:10] the names of that stack Bitcoin with
[54:13] like 5% or like 10% of the balance sheet
[54:15] and they're like uh we we it's like
[54:18] smaller family-owned businesses
[54:19] sometimes or like they have um the fear
[54:21] that someone finds out or something like
[54:23] that it's like the career risk thing
[54:26] that they're like still keeping away
[54:28] like and they don't want to talk about
[54:30] it it's very different I think in the in
[54:32] the American sense now like oh like we
[54:34] have Bitcoin C we're great company just
[54:37] wondering if you heard anything like
[54:39] that in the UK if if if you hear about
[54:43] Bitcoin companies like companies that
[54:45] are far away from Bitcoin but still
[54:48] experimenting with Bitcoin on the
[54:49] balance sheet and other
[54:51] things only anecdotally like you um you
[54:54] know I've got friends friends of friends
[54:55] who dabbled a bit or just got a little
[54:57] bit and they they they put on the
[54:59] balance sheet uh I mean one of my
[55:01] companies obviously operates with with
[55:03] Bitcoin the balance sheet um and
[55:07] uh you're right it does fall into a
[55:11] couple of camps you know because you've
[55:12] got you know one extreme you've got the
[55:13] Sailor a public company anyway so they
[55:15] have to to to make everything um known
[55:18] but there are there are private
[55:20] companies as well who have kept it quite
[55:21] there are there are a few who who who've
[55:23] been vocal about it you know there's
[55:25] some on Twitter who announcing every now
[55:26] and again I've bought another .5 Bitcoin
[55:29] for the company treasury um generally
[55:31] smaller amounts because they're smaller
[55:33] companies um so we we we know it's
[55:36] happening um I don't know if we get
[55:38] really a true picture I I think at some
[55:42] stage it may become fashionable to talk
[55:45] about it but I don't think we're at that
[55:48] stage yet so I think a lot of people um
[55:51] do keep it quiet and I do think the
[55:53] number of companies that have it is
[55:54] higher than we think it's still small
[55:57] but I suspect it's higher than than we
[55:59] think yeah absolutely it's a it's a very
[56:02] small uh number he talked about maybe uh
[56:06] 1% is of all companies currently of the
[56:10] research and studies that he has done in
[56:12] the German speaking area are interested
[56:14] or currently thinking about that like 1%
[56:16] of all companies those are tens of
[56:18] thousands of companies of course like
[56:21] but it's not that much I tell you what
[56:23] we should get them along to business day
[56:25] at Prague those guys will be exactly the
[56:28] Right audience for that and those guys
[56:30] who are on the fence would really
[56:32] benefit from that um so uh let's tell
[56:36] them absolutely that that that will be
[56:39] great so also uh one thing um uh that
[56:43] that he told me is like two years ago he
[56:45] had to reach out to companies he do you
[56:47] want to buy Bitcoin and stuff like that
[56:49] now he has so much to do that he just
[56:52] gets only the the reest that comes like
[56:54] hey we want to buy Bitcoin so he sees a
[56:55] lot of uh interest there so that that
[56:58] will be I think that career risk aspect
[57:00] of it will flip uh rather soon I don't
[57:04] think like this year or like it depends
[57:07] on like which country and where are
[57:08] America maybe sooner than in the in the
[57:10] European region uh but that career risk
[57:13] seems to flip slowly slowly as it's
[57:15] getting uh normalized of like it's a
[57:18] career risk that you talk about Bitcoin
[57:20] and maybe at some point it's a great
[57:22] risk not to have any knowledge about
[57:25] Bitcoin um yeah and also don't forget if
[57:29] if we're talking about companies still
[57:31] uh again an analogy you can take from
[57:33] the internet dates at the time it
[57:35] exploded because remember there was this
[57:38] negative idea and it seems crazy but it
[57:40] really wasn't seen as a useful thing in
[57:43] the early days but some people did go
[57:46] ahead you know web designers Business
[57:47] Consultants process integrators these
[57:50] guys went out and realized what was
[57:52] going on uh and then were able to sell
[57:55] their services to companies either their
[57:57] own companies or other companies and
[57:59] pretty much set whatever hourly rate
[58:01] they wanted because of course everyone
[58:03] needs suddenly realize we need the
[58:05] Internet and we need to know how to use
[58:07] it and install it and so it wasn't just
[58:09] technical people it was all these
[58:10] process and marketing people as well had
[58:13] to come up with whole new strategies for
[58:15] the companies so those people for quite
[58:17] a long period of time really became
[58:20] quite indispensable and I'm pretty sure
[58:23] we're going to see the same thing uh
[58:25] with Bitcoin is This Global open source
[58:27] Network you know I talk about being the
[58:30] go-to guy you know I think you know if
[58:32] you can become the go-to guy for your
[58:35] company it may not happen today you know
[58:37] you might have to have a bit of patience
[58:39] but eventually the companies are going
[58:41] to realize we need to either look at
[58:43] this from a treasury point of view a
[58:44] payment point of view something like
[58:46] that I have no idea but doesn't that
[58:49] Robin guy he talks he talks about
[58:51] Bitcoin doesn't he know about it let's
[58:52] get him in let's get him to set up a
[58:54] task force head up the Vision I want
[58:57] this to happen yesterday you're the guy
[59:00] how much is it going to cost me so you
[59:02] know I think I think there's going to be
[59:03] an element of that uh because we've
[59:05] already seen it so we're going to see it
[59:07] again so listen I would say to you if
[59:08] you're in a company um and you know you
[59:12] know bit about Bitcoin is educate
[59:13] yourself now and get ready because I
[59:15] think that day will ultimately come
[59:18] that's a super interesting point of like
[59:21] no matter what you do in a company to
[59:24] position yourself as the Bitcoin guy
[59:26] could be very beneficial to care to your
[59:29] career in the next like five to 10 years
[59:31] I don't think there's any question of
[59:33] that I mean you've got the decision
[59:34] makers that thought we're talking about
[59:35] the people who own the companies and the
[59:37] SE site Executives who talk this through
[59:39] but someone's going to execute that
[59:42] strategy and you know if you're the
[59:44] go-to guy you're you're the one who's
[59:46] going to be able to um say yeah I'll do
[59:49] it but I want a 80% prorize please
[59:52] really cool all of all of the sudden you
[59:54] can uh charge Consultants premium
[59:58] it'll happen I'm telling you that's
[60:00] amazing I think and super fun like 435
[60:04] episodes and never thought about that
[60:06] aspect bitco Bitcoin employees um one
[60:09] thing that uh I want to we already over
[60:11] the hour but one thing that I want to
[60:13] touch on because you brought it two
[60:14] times actually already up the internet
[60:16] adoption internet adoption and comparing
[60:18] that with the Bitcoin adoption how
[60:20] comparable are they and and and what
[60:22] kind of do you think um will happen with
[60:24] with the Bitcoin adoption if it's
[60:26] comparable to to the what happened with
[60:28] the internet
[60:29] adoption yes brilliant question I do
[60:31] talk about this quite a lot I mean I
[60:33] love the analogy because of course
[60:34] they're both Global open- Source uh
[60:36] networks that you can build on and
[60:38] aren't you effectively controlled uh um
[60:41] um by anyone so everyone's got this
[60:44] ability to access it and use it whenever
[60:46] they want to one because of the other of
[60:48] course you know adoption rates it's
[60:50] fascinating because there's a lot of
[60:52] work done on what the adoption level is
[60:54] it's very hard to say what that is for
[60:57] for lots of reasons you know mainly to
[60:59] do with number of one it's creative
[61:01] creative and active movement on that and
[61:04] a lot of the research houses do produce
[61:07] data from time to time saying what it is
[61:10] uh Willy woo I think you know the
[61:12] analyst uh he he produced a couple of
[61:15] tweets fairly recently uh and I really
[61:17] trust that guy's judgment he's very good
[61:19] at cating data and looking at it
[61:21] objectively uh and I think the the kind
[61:24] of the most optimistic View point is
[61:26] we're around 4 to 5% Global adoption now
[61:29] there are people who disagree with that
[61:31] and think it's a bit lower and I think
[61:32] it's probably the optimistic end of what
[61:35] the where we are now uh and then you
[61:38] look at that you map that back to where
[61:39] we are where we were on the internet and
[61:42] you end up somewhere around I think it's
[61:44] 96 97 not quite me exactly on that but
[61:47] I'm pretty sure it's somewhere around
[61:49] there and if you compare the two S
[61:51] curves together obviously you get
[61:53] nothing nothing nothing nothing and then
[61:54] you get a movement upwards
[61:56] it looks visually very close to to the
[61:59] Bitcoin level of adoption going forward
[62:01] in terms of
[62:02] forecasting pretty much all I think in
[62:04] fact all of the forecasting hous the
[62:06] research houses do predict a billion
[62:09] users no later than 2030 some of them
[62:12] predict it a lot sooner I think the most
[62:14] optimistic is the end of this year which
[62:16] I think is probably a little over
[62:18] ambitious um but we can say I think
[62:21] safely that we're looking between um you
[62:24] know now and the end of 203 to billion
[62:26] users which would be uh I think pretty
[62:29] comparable to the internet and that
[62:31] doesn't really surprise me it's Network
[62:33] effect right more people start using
[62:35] adop it the more value it has so the
[62:37] more people start using it it wasn't
[62:39] just the internet phones radio
[62:42] everything has that same network effect
[62:44] so um I think I may have gone on a bit
[62:46] too long there but hopefully I've
[62:47] answered your question no it was
[62:49] brilliant uh I like it a lot and the
[62:52] just um a small thing I want to add on
[62:55] to is those four four to five% users for
[62:59] me it's always also a question of like
[63:01] how much and how convicted they already
[63:04] in Bitcoin and how many that did they
[63:07] actually understand Bitcoin because for
[63:09] me if you have let's say let's say your
[63:12] netw worth is like a
[63:13] $50,000 uh and you have $1,000 in
[63:17] Bitcoin I'm not sure if you really
[63:19] understood what Bitcoin is I know I
[63:21] totally agree with you I mean you know
[63:23] these numbers have all sorts of nuances
[63:25] and you're absolutely right when you be
[63:27] looking at research there's a whole load
[63:29] of uh of caveat so you're absolutely
[63:31] correc in your statement and because of
[63:34] the way the only way we can measure it
[63:36] you know is is some onchain uh data
[63:39] really can do with surveys but they're
[63:41] notoriously unreliable um so we end up
[63:43] with this sort of number around that
[63:45] level and there are a lot of caveats to
[63:48] it so um however interestingly over the
[63:51] years we have seen that number increase
[63:52] so even with all those caveats and the
[63:54] mess and the Very that around it we have
[63:57] seen uh an increase I think the number
[63:59] we were quoting in 2016 17 was certainly
[64:03] less than 1% um so we have seen it go up
[64:06] and we have seen it move faster we don't
[64:08] know what the actual number is but we
[64:10] have seen it move faster yeah I think
[64:12] that's that that's a good point of we we
[64:14] can measure if the numbers stays
[64:16] consistent and we're looking at the same
[64:17] consistent onchain and Survey datas uh
[64:20] and we track that same number we can see
[64:22] the rate of change we don't know exactly
[64:25] how accurate that number is but at least
[64:27] we see how how quickly it's going to be
[64:30] adopted it would be really fun to see
[64:33] statistics of like all Hardware wallets
[64:35] producers combin how many Hardware
[64:37] wallets did you sell like like what is
[64:39] the rate do you know how many users
[64:41] there are like I think that there are a
[64:43] lot of Statistics that we just don't
[64:44] have that would be really fun to see I
[64:47] know actually like last year at Bitcoin
[64:50] Prague I think treasure talked about
[64:52] that that only was it 2% I think 2% he
[64:56] said only 2% of bitcoiners have a
[64:58] hardware wallet so yeah I think that was
[65:01] that last
[65:02] year yeah I think last year was it
[65:05] because that was where I I made the
[65:07] podcast with him and with with saor uh
[65:10] and and and this was I'm I'm I'm 99%
[65:14] sure it was last year well it' be
[65:17] interesting to see if we can get any
[65:18] updates to those numbers but that that
[65:20] that doesn't surprise me uh because you
[65:22] know in being in the Bitcoin space we
[65:24] think all these cool things are
[65:26] happening left right and center but but
[65:27] the reality is we are still at the
[65:29] beginning of this this whole
[65:31] Revolution um you know my kids grew up
[65:33] with the internet going back to that
[65:35] analogy no one's really grown up with
[65:37] Bitcoin yet um it'll be some time before
[65:40] that's kind of a normal thing uh we're
[65:42] not anywhere close to that so things
[65:44] like self- custody self a proper self-
[65:46] sovereignty are all included in that but
[65:48] they're kind of aspirational they're
[65:49] much further down the curve you know we
[65:51] got to shitcoin play with exchanges and
[65:54] do all that other stuff first before we
[65:56] we get to to that point and um you know
[65:59] part of what we do particularly part of
[66:00] what you do Robin is is trying to
[66:02] shorten that process a bit and hopefully
[66:05] avoid a lot of the mistakes that uh
[66:07] certainly I've made and others made in
[66:09] the very early days by not taking the
[66:11] time to understand it properly which is
[66:14] um which is which is no mean fate it it
[66:16] does it does take time I found it
[66:19] actually okay but uh without hearing him
[66:23] talk I'm not sure exactly what those 2%
[66:26] but those 2% I remember and I I think he
[66:28] said that only 2% U of of bitcoiners
[66:32] have Hardware wallets but I don't know
[66:33] what is 500 million if if you I think
[66:35] that's the 500 million is is estimated
[66:37] users because that's that's one of the
[66:39] numbers that's half a billion so that's
[66:40] one of the numbers that's been floated
[66:42] around um as now it's within that sort
[66:45] of same ballpark still so um you do see
[66:47] that one around as well yeah super
[66:49] interesting but yeah uh uh that that
[66:52] number was super shocking for me that's
[66:53] why it stayed in my head because I I
[66:56] made polls myself on on my YouTube
[66:58] channel but maybe I have a more self-
[67:01] custody uh audience and and there's
[67:03] usually like 40 to 50% of people that do
[67:06] self- custody versus not doing self-
[67:08] custody um but yeah
[67:11] um maybe some of the Bitcoin users as
[67:13] mentioned they had just have $1 th doll
[67:15] in Bitcoin have it on some exchange or
[67:17] maybe in an ETF or anything like
[67:20] that they they don't watch Bitcoin
[67:22] channels no they just that's why you're
[67:25] are probably skewed as well I mean you
[67:27] said 40 to 50% I mean well these guys
[67:29] are bitcoiners they're following you
[67:30] because they're um fascinating what
[67:33] you're talking about and and and the
[67:35] development is going on same as me so
[67:36] they're going to have a much excuse me
[67:38] much higher propensity um to to say yeah
[67:42] self custody so do every second of my
[67:45] audience please get the self- custody
[67:47] set up it is quite scary when you do it
[67:50] the first time I don't know about you
[67:52] but I was quite nervous about the whole
[67:54] thing but actually uh it it does it's
[67:56] not that bad and take your time to
[67:58] little
[67:59] bit how long did it take you from first
[68:03] buying Bitcoin to First getting self
[68:06] custody yes I mean it was 16 right so uh
[68:10] you know I it took me you know I did I
[68:13] did all the classic mistakes I think we
[68:15] talked about last time you know
[68:16] shitcoins do things wrong and and and
[68:18] yeah so less said about that the better
[68:21] I think but yeah I took the long way
[68:24] around on that one as well so seems to
[68:25] be the way I do things get there in the
[68:27] end though get the right result but uh
[68:29] just I don't know why it takes sometime
[68:31] for my brain to uh to get all the
[68:34] factors together I think it's super
[68:36] interesting it took me a while to really
[68:38] understand Bitcoin and I thought in the
[68:40] beginning that actually Bitcoin is a
[68:42] scam and I wanted to prove my friend
[68:43] wrong and I told that story over and
[68:45] over in the podcast but um I actually
[68:48] got a self like a ledger on day one like
[68:51] I I just bought that um because I was
[68:55] listening to with one Bitcoin guy and he
[68:56] was just like oh you need a self C and
[68:58] and it I wasn't aware that you can keep
[69:01] your Bitcoin even an exchange so I I
[69:04] thought you actually have to have a
[69:06] wallet in the be beginning to to keep
[69:08] your Bitcoin I think that I think that
[69:11] for me it was just a default that you
[69:12] have to have and so I bought Bitcoin I
[69:16] was still not sure if if it's even
[69:18] something valuable uh but I was like
[69:21] okay let's let's put a $100 in Bitcoin
[69:23] let's buy that leder wallet for like I
[69:25] don't know $150 doar or what it was uh
[69:29] and let's try that thing out of like
[69:31] from the bank to The Exchange I think
[69:33] back then I use coinbase then from
[69:35] coinbase to Ledger and from Ledger back
[69:37] to coinbase and from coinbase back to my
[69:38] bank I just wanted to figure that thing
[69:41] out so actually I'm I'm I'm very proud
[69:44] it was not I'm I'm so impressed I'm glad
[69:47] you're doing this job Rob that's all I
[69:48] can
[69:49] say no it took me a long while to
[69:52] actually understand Bitcoin even though
[69:53] I had it for for for a year and I
[69:56] thought about I needed three years to
[69:57] get over the thing that Bitcoin is a
[69:59] scam so I could have three years earlier
[70:02] you did like step 10 and then did steps
[70:05] one to nine
[70:07] after yeah uh but hard wallet was um I I
[70:12] got the I probably just clicked on the
[70:14] Right video and and the right guy was
[70:15] like oh you need a hard wall and I was
[70:17] like okay maybe I can keep it longer
[70:19] than a year on the on the exchange or
[70:21] something like that uh and it was just
[70:23] natural for me but yeah any any anyways
[70:26] um thank you so much for for that we
[70:28] have now a question I think last time we
[70:31] didn't do it um it's a question that I
[70:34] brought into the podcast a little later
[70:36] uh it's one that I give every each and
[70:38] every one of my guests and the the
[70:40] question is what can we learn from you
[70:41] besides
[70:42] Bitcoin what you learn from me beside
[70:46] Bitcoin uh that it takes me a long time
[70:49] to get to the right conclusion
[70:50] ultimately um no
[70:53] uh you you're still very early
[70:57] uh what can you learn from me I I don't
[70:58] know is there anything else I'm good at
[71:00] I I'm I'm not sure there is um Mining
[71:02] and Bitcoin pretty good at those um do
[71:07] you know what I don't know if that's a
[71:08] statement of my life at this point uh
[71:11] that I actually have to really think
[71:12] about that um I think the only other
[71:15] thing I would say uh that I I can do
[71:18] quite well is writing so I've written a
[71:20] couple of books and thousands of
[71:22] Articles um so uh um so that that that
[71:26] would probably be the area that I would
[71:28] go from and we actually did do this
[71:30] question last time but I can't remember
[71:32] what you asked
[71:34] me yeah we have already like we have an
[71:37] end routine where the previous guest is
[71:39] asking a question for the next guest
[71:40] this is has been in but I wasn't sure if
[71:42] I already did that question also last
[71:44] time really interesting um now to the
[71:46] end actual end routine um where the
[71:49] previous guest is asking a question for
[71:50] the next guest without knowing who the
[71:51] next guest actually is and it's a super
[71:53] interesting one it was with the
[71:55] obviously yesterday guest um there are
[71:58] currently uh 35 strategic Bitcoin
[72:01] Reserve bills active it's it's quite a
[72:04] lot uh in in in in the states um how
[72:08] many do you think will at the end of the
[72:10] Trump Administration actually have a
[72:13] strategic Bitcoin reserve of the states
[72:15] okay well that is an interesting
[72:16] question so the end of the Trump
[72:18] Administration so we're what 53 days in
[72:21] aren't we so uh that's quite a lot of
[72:24] time um four years Dennis Porter is
[72:27] obviously he's got a lot going on a lot
[72:30] of the states have already well not a
[72:32] lot but some states already iced it some
[72:35] for now anyway they'll come back uh I
[72:38] think we've got three looking pretty
[72:41] promising I think as seem to remember is
[72:42] it Utah Florida and Texas don't quote me
[72:44] on that who look like they may go over
[72:47] the line first oh yeah that's that's is
[72:49] that Arizona oh yeah it looks like it
[72:52] yeah it's a I I just discovered that
[72:55] website yesterday it's actually a really
[72:57] good overview of of where those bills
[73:00] are and you can actually also see the
[73:02] original source and and the bill
[73:05] directly also when you look to the
[73:07] details yeah that's useful I think so I
[73:09] got it looks like I got Floyd or wrong
[73:11] they're still in the early stages but
[73:13] the question was how many um right 50
[73:15] states not all will introduced I'd say
[73:18] there's a good case for around half a
[73:21] dozen so this is all the way through and
[73:24] actively buy I know that doesn't seem
[73:26] many in four years for the amount of
[73:27] bills that are going on but there's
[73:29] going to be a whole load of issues with
[73:31] this and it's going to take some time to
[73:33] work it all out so I I'm going to go for
[73:36] six um and that's really no more than a
[73:39] gut fill maybe a slight educated
[73:42] guesstimate but to be honest with you I
[73:44] think at this stage it's anyone's guess
[73:46] absolutely and there has been already
[73:48] six bills that failed at this point so
[73:51] it's already
[73:53] um just because there are now 30 35
[73:57] bills active doesn't mean that they all
[73:59] pass they probably won't all pass and
[74:02] and maybe some have to be reintroduced
[74:04] and like things like that and yeah
[74:07] political system is uh more more
[74:11] complicated than we think and they can
[74:12] even even if because people say oh like
[74:14] House and Senate is now uh
[74:18] um Republican but the states have also
[74:21] different house and senates and um even
[74:24] if House and Senate is Republican there
[74:27] can still be opposition within the
[74:29] Republican party that says like oh we
[74:31] don't want that Bitcoin thing it's not
[74:32] that just because Trump is now a
[74:36] Bitcoin how much he's a bitcoiner we can
[74:38] discuss
[74:39] but let not go crazy crazy with that
[74:44] yeah that all Republicans are for
[74:46] Bitcoin now that's that's not the case
[74:47] yeah really interesting thank you so
[74:49] much for for that um before I let you go
[74:51] where can people find you ask you
[74:52] questions and reach out to you yeah
[74:55] please do because I say it's
[74:56] particularly with mining in the UK it's
[74:57] very exciting at the moment um and uh
[75:01] it's something we we we love to talk
[75:03] about as much as possible um so look
[75:05] Twitter is my uh is my main thing I I
[75:07] have been fairly quiet on Twitter
[75:09] recently mainly because I've been so
[75:10] busy but we'll get back to that so
[75:12] that's uh um Jason Aden um and of course
[75:17] there's uh renewal blocks as well which
[75:19] is got an odd spelling but maybe we put
[75:20] the link in the in the notes to make it
[75:22] um easier to find uh as you have new
[75:25] website going live I think it's next
[75:27] week it's more or less a placeholder at
[75:29] the moment so that will give more
[75:30] information on What's um what's going on
[75:33] in some of the uh investment
[75:34] opportunities and that's just renewal
[75:36] blocks.com uh they're the best place to
[75:38] get hold of me my DMs are open my my
[75:41] emails is out there as well so I always

[75:58] few years ago uh and traveled all over
[76:01] the place so um I've rained it in for a
[76:04] bit uh but I'm looking I am looking
[76:05] forward to Prague and um and I think I
