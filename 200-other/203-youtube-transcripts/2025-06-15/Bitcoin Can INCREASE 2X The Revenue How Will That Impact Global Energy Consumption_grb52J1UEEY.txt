[00:00] buying any asset regardless of whether
[00:02] it's Bitcoin or you know a stock and
[00:05] being able to remove the emotions from
[00:07] that decision-making process is really
[00:09] beneficial I think toward towards the
[00:10] long term quality of life is directly
[00:13] correlated with annual kilowatt hour
[00:15] consumption per capita right so the
[00:18] wealthiest most prosperous best places
[00:20] to live in the world all have the
[00:22] highest annual kilowatt hour consumption
[00:24] per capita certainly if if the price of
[00:26] of Bitcoin were to double tomorrow the
[00:29] revenue revenue that you're going to be
[00:30] producing is going to be, you know,
[00:32] twice as much essentially while still
[00:34] maintaining that fixed cost of
[00:35] electricity. I think it'll be a good
[00:37] opportunity for the long-term um private
[00:39] miners and, you know, companies who can
[00:41] operate efficiently, which I think
[00:42] energy consumption can kind of have a
[00:44] negative connotation. However, we need
[00:46] more energy consumption. We need more
[00:48] energy production.
[00:51] [Music]
[00:54] Hi, Adam. How you doing? Everything fine
[00:55] on your end? Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:57] Nice day here in Iowa. So, you know,
[00:59] can't complain too much for for
[01:00] springtime in Iowa. Um, how's it going
[01:03] today? Thanks for having me on. So, so
[01:05] great to have you on. Um, for the people
[01:07] that don't know, maybe let's let's get
[01:09] started with who are you and and and why
[01:11] are you into Bitcoin? Yeah, I'm I'm Adam
[01:14] Haynes, the founder and CEO of Simple
[01:16] Mining. Um, why am I into Bitcoin? Is is
[01:19] maybe a little bit of a long story, but
[01:21] um, you know, um, started the company
[01:24] four years ago. was really born out of
[01:26] my my first business which was a retail
[01:28] cell phone repair business. Uh started
[01:31] that um basically a year out of college
[01:34] I dropped out and then um opened my
[01:37] phone repair business and was expanding
[01:39] the cell phone repair business and then
[01:41] during COVID we um we kind of put our
[01:44] expansion plans on pause and one of our
[01:46] employees was mining Bitcoin and we
[01:48] started dabbling doing some of the micro
[01:50] repairs on some of the machines. I had
[01:52] heard of Bitcoin at that point in time
[01:54] um but never done you know the taken the
[01:56] time to do the research to really fully
[01:58] understand it. Um so kind of went down
[02:01] the rabbit hole you know Bitcoin
[02:02] standard and and all of that good stuff
[02:04] and um
[02:06] was very quickly orange pill right and
[02:09] thought what is a good way um that you
[02:12] know I could accumulate more Bitcoin and
[02:15] started exploring the mining. Um we were
[02:18] doing that in the back of one of our
[02:19] cell phone repair stores. um here in
[02:22] Iowa, it's a it's a really good place to
[02:24] do this business. Iowa um actually leads
[02:27] the country in wind power production
[02:30] from a percentage standpoint. So about
[02:31] twothirds of the energy here in Iowa is
[02:34] um renewable wind energy. So not a lot
[02:37] going on in Iowa besides uh corn fields
[02:39] and windmills, but uh you know it's it's
[02:41] a good place to mine Bitcoin. So started
[02:43] doing it a little bit in the back of our
[02:44] phone repair stores and you know kind of
[02:46] explored some uh ways to do this at more
[02:50] of an industrial scale. Um had some
[02:52] conversations with our local utility
[02:54] company. One thing led to another and
[02:57] you know we started with 50 machines um
[02:59] running down at our our first facility
[03:01] in 2021 and we've continued to kind of
[03:05] scale and grow um uh since that point in
[03:08] time. Now we have over 20,000 machines
[03:10] operating, you know, uh, over 60
[03:12] megawatts across seven different
[03:14] facilities in Iowa. Um, and really our
[03:17] focus point is on, um, offering a great
[03:20] hosted solution for machines. Um, and
[03:23] doing the repair services as well. That
[03:26] went quick from like I I run one or two
[03:29] machines in the back of the store to
[03:30] like I have 20,000 machines up and
[03:33] running. Yeah. Yeah. It's been it's been
[03:35] a lot of fun. you know, we um we saw an
[03:38] opportunity when we first started, you
[03:40] know, first started the company um to
[03:43] come in and take all the principles that
[03:45] made us successful in the cell phone
[03:47] repair business and um apply those to,
[03:50] you know, this industry, right? So, um
[03:53] it's very critical in this industry to
[03:55] make sure your machines have a high
[03:56] uptime, right? If your machine's not
[03:58] online, it's not producing any Bitcoin.
[04:00] So, um been very fortunate. We have a
[04:03] great really great team. You know, a lot
[04:05] of a lot of this is, you know, um all
[04:08] the success I can, you know, uh point to
[04:10] a lot of members on our team that have
[04:12] been really great at growing the
[04:13] business and building out the different
[04:15] things that we have to operate and
[04:17] execute an extremely high level. Um
[04:19] first started the company, uh our uh
[04:22] CTO, uh Lucas actually came over from
[04:24] the cell phone repair stores. He's an
[04:26] absolute wizard. And um from the very
[04:28] beginning we we noticed how critical
[04:30] that was in order to keep machines
[04:32] online, right? And um we he's been you
[04:36] know paramount in building out our um
[04:38] you know backend systems and processes
[04:40] and automations to ensure that we have a
[04:42] really really high um uptime with all of
[04:45] the equipment. So it's
[04:46] about it's about the the what did excite
[04:50] you about Bitcoin mining? Was it the
[04:52] electrical aspect that you could mine
[04:54] magic internet money o over electricity
[04:56] and and or is it the thing that you can
[04:59] get additional return of investment on
[05:01] top of of your Bitcoin or build a
[05:03] business around that? Yeah. Yeah. I
[05:05] think I think um you know especially
[05:06] when we first got started the the um the
[05:09] prospect of being able to sort of
[05:11] accumulate Bitcoin um at a discount to
[05:14] the spot price was very very intriguing.
[05:18] So, um, and then just naturally being
[05:21] here in Iowa where there's a, you know,
[05:23] a really good opportunity to do this
[05:24] business, you know, things kind of just
[05:26] came together, um, you know, naturally,
[05:28] I would say. So, um, very, you know, uh,
[05:31] very optimistic and bullish long-term
[05:33] about Bitcoin, you know, full-on Bitcoin
[05:35] maxi and, you know, we just saw a really
[05:38] good opportunity to, um, set up this
[05:40] facility and, um, you know, be able to
[05:42] generate, um, Bitcoin at a discount to
[05:45] spot.
[05:46] really interesting. Um, a lot of people
[05:49] say when when it comes to mining
[05:52] Bitcoin, they're like, "Oh, that just
[05:54] just buy Bitcoin directly." If if you
[05:56] want to do something like do do a Bitex
[05:58] or something like that, some some small
[05:59] solo mining, but that's not that's not
[06:01] real mining. It is mining but uh on a
[06:05] such a small scale um to compared to
[06:08] that is it a good idea to instead of
[06:11] mining bitcoin instead of buying bitcoin
[06:14] to to mine bitcoin long term uh and is
[06:17] there like a framework to think about
[06:19] when does it make sense and and when
[06:21] does it not make sense? Yeah, it's a
[06:23] great question. We it's a very common
[06:25] question that we get asked. Um so the um
[06:29] answer that I have to that is I don't
[06:31] think it's one or the other. All right.
[06:32] So, I think if there's a really good
[06:34] opportunity, um, you know, a buy the dip
[06:36] moment, if you will, absolutely, you
[06:38] know, buy that dip and, you know, uh,
[06:41] stack stack sets. Um, however, I think
[06:43] that mining is a really interesting, um,
[06:46] opportunity to sort of, you know, it's a
[06:48] forced to dollar cost average, right?
[06:50] you know, we've done some um analysis of
[06:53] some of our clients and um it's pretty
[06:56] interesting results that have shown that
[06:58] um you know, buying any asset regardless
[07:02] of whether it's Bitcoin or you know, a
[07:04] stock is very emotional, right? And
[07:07] being able to remove the emotions from
[07:09] that decision-making process um is
[07:12] really beneficial, I think, to towards
[07:14] the long term. So you can think of the
[07:15] miners as like a forced DCA while also
[07:18] having you know some significant tax
[07:20] advantages um being able to operate you
[07:23] know your mining uh company as a
[07:25] business and you know the different
[07:26] benefits that that um provides. So um I
[07:29] think it's a little bit of both. Um I I
[07:31] think that you know on the emotional
[07:32] side there there's two sides of it. one,
[07:35] maybe you don't, you know, maybe you
[07:36] don't buy enough when prices are low,
[07:38] right? Or vice versa, you know, um, when
[07:41] prices are higher, maybe, uh, you know,
[07:44] maybe we're not accumulating as much
[07:45] because, oh, the price seems really high
[07:47] now when, you know, you and I both know
[07:49] over the long term, it's we should be
[07:51] accumulating, you know, this this asset
[07:54] every single day. So, um, I think it's a
[07:56] combination of both. Um but you know the
[07:59] the mining provides some interesting um
[08:02] force to DCA and different benefits.
[08:06] Yeah. And and I guess I guess you have
[08:09] uh different ways to to do that. I mean
[08:11] with simple mining you can set something
[08:13] up and and and basically um let you do
[08:17] the the the uh the the setup work. And
[08:21] uh if you want to do it yourself uh it
[08:24] it's it's probably a lot of work because
[08:26] I those things can uh have some some
[08:29] technical problems and and and do some
[08:31] electricity things which uh yeah might
[08:34] might not be the the best if you cannot
[08:36] handle that. Um, how do you think about
[08:39] uh someone having running their own uh
[08:43] miners and and do doing that work
[08:46] versus doing that with a with a service
[08:48] like like you were doing? Yeah. No, it's
[08:51] um we've worked with a lot of different
[08:53] clients who have done you know their own
[08:54] miners at home for example and um you
[08:57] know I think that's part of the benefits
[08:58] that we provide is we provide a really
[09:00] you know hands-off premium white glove
[09:02] service. So, we're going to make it easy
[09:04] for anybody to mine Bitcoin. Um, you
[09:07] know, these particular machines are, you
[09:09] know, quite loud. Uh, they produce a lot
[09:11] of heat. Um, the the cost of electricity
[09:14] in the United States, um, average
[09:17] residential cost of electricity is about
[09:19] 16 cents per kilowatt hour. So, you
[09:21] know, we're able to come in and provide
[09:22] all of these services um, as it relates
[09:25] to running the machines, maintaining
[09:27] them, doing the advanced micro soldering
[09:29] repairs um, and operating this at a high
[09:32] level. We have the contracts with the
[09:34] utility companies to be able to go get
[09:36] that low cost of power. Um to be able to
[09:38] kind of offer an all-in-one solution. Um
[09:40] we have a a dashboard where you can view
[09:42] all of your machines, so on and so forth
[09:44] to just, you know, make it easy for
[09:46] anyone in the world to mine Bitcoin with
[09:48] us. Yeah. Super interesting. You said
[09:51] Bitcoin Max here. I'm just curious. Did
[09:53] you ever looked into mining anything
[09:55] else? Like did you ever look into
[09:57] shitcoin mining? Yeah, when we first got
[10:00] started, um, you know, as we were just
[10:03] just getting into it, we were mining
[10:04] Ethereum, um, back in the day. Uh, that
[10:07] was a pretty short-lived situation. Um,
[10:10] so yeah, since then, our focus, our only
[10:12] focus has been on Bitcoin. So,
[10:15] interesting. What What did you bring
[10:17] back to to Bitcoin? Uh, when you did
[10:20] Ethereum, uh, what did you bring uh,
[10:23] what got you back to Bitcoin only? I I
[10:26] think that just um in the beginning when
[10:28] we first got started the Ethereum mining
[10:30] at the time was um you know it was it
[10:32] was proof of work on Ethereum and you
[10:34] could mine with GPUs. So it was a it was
[10:36] a much quicker setup than than setting
[10:39] up um you know these particular ASIC
[10:41] machines. Um so it was a more of just an
[10:45] ease to get into it and that was in the
[10:46] very early stages. So, it was a very
[10:48] short-lived period of time while we were
[10:50] mining with um you know the GPUs in the
[10:53] back of our cell phone repair store.
[10:55] That's that's super interesting. I'm
[10:57] always I'm always curious because it's
[10:58] it's with mining we have with with
[11:01] buying Bitcoin. Most Bitcoiners have
[11:03] that phase where they buy Bitcoin, then
[11:05] they discover altcoins, then they go
[11:07] back bit to the Bitcoin only. So, it was
[11:09] I was curious to see that with mining
[11:11] Bitcoin. It's it's it's similar. What
[11:13] What do you think? Um uh and I had that
[11:16] in the my mind when you talked about
[11:18] Bitcoin mining. What do you think
[11:20] Bitcoin mining will bring to the world
[11:22] outside of just securing securing money?
[11:25] Sure. Yeah. Well, I think there's a
[11:27] really unique opportunity in the energy
[11:30] space, right?
[11:31] So if you look at just a really basic
[11:34] metric of you know human prosperity
[11:37] across the world um you know quality of
[11:40] life is directly correlated with annual
[11:43] kilowatt hour consumption per capita
[11:45] right so the uh wealthiest most
[11:48] prosperous um you know best places to
[11:52] live in the world all have the highest
[11:54] annual um kilowatt hour consumption per
[11:57] capita. So, I think if you just look
[11:59] naturally right now, the the Bitcoin
[12:01] network is about 15 gawatts of energy
[12:04] globally. Um, and it's going to continue
[12:07] to grow over time. It's only going to
[12:08] consume more and more and more energy,
[12:11] which I think energy consumption can
[12:12] kind of have a negative connotation.
[12:15] However, um, we need more energy
[12:17] consumption. We need more energy
[12:18] production. Um, that's only going to
[12:20] help improve quality of life across the
[12:23] world. So, I think there's a really good
[12:25] opportunity for Bitcoin to help continue
[12:28] to build out more energy production um
[12:31] that will enable um just better quality
[12:34] of life. Uh you know, a unique way to
[12:37] think about this is especially here in
[12:39] Iowa, um we have a lot of renewable
[12:41] energy. Renewables are great. However,
[12:44] there's some downside to them too as
[12:46] well. The downside is if the sun isn't
[12:49] shining and the wind isn't blowing, the
[12:51] energy production still has to come from
[12:53] somewhere. Um we have a unique ability
[12:55] where we can um you know shut down our
[12:57] facilities curtail or load shed uh to
[13:00] help balance out that supply and demand
[13:02] in times when the you know grid is
[13:04] getting out of balance.
[13:06] Um what Bitcoiners do is they're a buyer
[13:09] of 20 uh electricity 24/7 um while
[13:13] prices are are low obviously. And what
[13:16] that helps do is if there's more buyers
[13:18] of energy, it helps bring on more
[13:20] production of energy. So the more energy
[13:23] production that we can have, it just
[13:24] facilitates, you know, more growth in
[13:26] other industries and being able to help
[13:28] keep that grid reliable for everybody.
[13:32] That's super
[13:33] interesting. Yeah, this uh notion of
[13:36] energy consumption is is bad is is so
[13:39] annoying because uh if if we really go
[13:43] down that uh lane of every energy
[13:47] consumption is bad and we have to make
[13:49] it as efficient as possible, we
[13:51] basically come to the conclusion we have
[13:53] to kill ourselves.
[13:57] Why do you think the why do you think
[13:58] there's this notion that energy energy
[14:01] consumption equals bad? Yeah. Well, I
[14:05] think that that agenda has been pushed
[14:07] um you know especially as it relates to
[14:10] you know renewable energy and you know
[14:12] consumption and those things um it's it
[14:15] definitely has a negative connotation
[14:16] associated with it. Um however if you
[14:19] just purely look at the data we can see
[14:21] that the more energy that we consume um
[14:24] the the better off society is right and
[14:28] you know I want to continue trying to
[14:30] you know spread that word um because
[14:32] more energy consumption more energy
[14:34] production is what everybody needs um
[14:36] you know everybody there's there's a lot
[14:38] of people out there that like to you
[14:40] know talk about you know what energy
[14:42] should be used for what application and
[14:43] this is a waste of energy why can't you
[14:45] know Bitcoin just switch to proof of
[14:47] stake so on and so forth forth, but at
[14:48] the same time, if there's no energy
[14:50] available to heat their home in the
[14:53] middle of winter or to air condition
[14:55] their, you know, home in the middle of
[14:57] summer when on a hot day, they're not
[14:59] going to care where the energy comes
[15:01] from, what the source of production is.
[15:03] They're just going to want access to
[15:04] that energy. And, you know, Bitcoin will
[15:07] help enable a more robust um uh system
[15:10] to be able to deliver that energy um you
[15:14] know, over time.
[15:16] Yeah, it's it's what I'm curious. What
[15:19] do you actually say? You probably get
[15:21] that a lot. What do you say to people
[15:22] that tell you, oh, like Bitcoin mining
[15:25] is so bad for for the environment, or is
[15:27] it slowly coming down that people don't
[15:29] say it anymore? Yeah, the the
[15:31] conversations are are certainly getting
[15:33] a lot better um you know, over the last
[15:35] couple of years. Um I I I think again
[15:38] just it's a lot about education. Um what
[15:40] we really try and do at Simple Mining is
[15:42] educate on all aspects of of Bitcoin and
[15:45] mining um you know everything from
[15:47] really really basic information all the
[15:49] way to you know the the technical
[15:51] nitty-gritty. So that conversation is um
[15:56] I think just a misinterpretation of the
[15:59] reality of how you know energy is being
[16:01] produced and used. Um, Bitcoin miners
[16:03] are, if you look at the natural supply
[16:05] and demand, we're we're very
[16:07] incentivized to use very low cost of
[16:09] energy, which is going to be a situation
[16:12] where there's sufficient supply, right?
[16:15] Um, if if there's not sufficient supply
[16:17] or there's extremely high demand,
[16:19] Bitcoin miners are going to be the first
[16:21] to, you know, shut down and um, give
[16:25] that energy back, basically. So, it's
[16:28] just a it's a I think it's a miscon
[16:30] misconception that Bitcoin miners are
[16:32] taking energy away from um potential
[16:35] uses when really um Bitcoin miners are
[16:38] using excess energy, you know, energy
[16:41] that would not have been consumed
[16:42] otherwise in most instances.
[16:45] So, in a way, Bitcoin mining is
[16:47] expanding the energy grid.
[16:51] Yeah, absolutely. um the the more um you
[16:54] know consumption that Bitcoin miners can
[16:57] use um over time that's just going to
[17:00] lead to a more robust system where you
[17:02] could have more energy production and
[17:04] more um especially as it relates to you
[17:07] know a system that is reliant upon
[17:10] renewables and the intermittency of
[17:12] available supply. um the more production
[17:15] you can bring on, especially as it
[17:17] relates to base load or even more
[17:18] renewables, it it just helps be able to
[17:21] deliver power at all times. Um even um
[17:25] you know, if you have twice as many
[17:27] windmills and even if the wind is low,
[17:30] you're still going to have more
[17:32] production overall even if um even if uh
[17:35] you know, the wind speed is low at that
[17:37] point in time. So now there's some uh
[17:39] there's some nuances, some details
[17:41] there, but Bitcoin miners being able to
[17:43] buy all of that excess energy 24/7. And
[17:46] if you talk about um you know a a system
[17:49] globally that is 15 gawatts currently
[17:51] and as that continues to scale to 20 25
[17:55] 40 50 gawatt that's a lot of energy um
[17:59] where Bitcoin miners are going to go out
[18:00] and try and find that low cost of
[18:02] energy. And it's it's a it's a great
[18:04] pair. It's interesting. Um, one thing
[18:07] with with Bitcom, do you also did you
[18:10] ever thought about also doing AI data
[18:12] centers because it's it's it's so so so
[18:16] popular right now with with AI. Is it
[18:18] something that you have looked into?
[18:20] Yeah. Yeah. So, I have a few thoughts on
[18:22] AI. um you know AI has certainly been
[18:25] the hype for the last um last couple of
[18:28] months and I think it's no doubt that AI
[18:30] is going to be very um very impactful
[18:32] very um you know deflationary as it
[18:35] relates to providing you know different
[18:37] services to uh to society. Um however I
[18:40] think that the you know the industry as
[18:43] a whole and maybe the business case
[18:45] behind building and operating AI data
[18:48] centers is still really really early and
[18:51] you have a lot of very very large
[18:53] companies that have um significant you
[18:56] know the mag seven companies for example
[18:58] that have very large balance sheets and
[19:00] they're willing to throw billions of
[19:02] dollars at the wall um it's just to see
[19:04] what sticks and I think if you look
[19:07] currently at the investment that's being
[19:09] made versus the future um expected
[19:12] revenues on that investment. Um there's
[19:14] not a great business case at this at
[19:16] this point in time. I think over you
[19:18] know over the course of the next you
[19:20] know three, five and certainly 10 years
[19:23] you'll see that evolve in in in really
[19:26] um a good business case will probably
[19:27] present itself. Um but currently we are
[19:30] not looking into any of the AI data
[19:32] centers. Um, you know, I think there's
[19:34] there's some really large companies that
[19:36] are uh working there, but I just my
[19:38] concern would be in the in the short to
[19:40] medium-term viability of those
[19:42] businesses based upon the investment and
[19:44] then the expected, you know, revenue to
[19:47] support those investments.
[19:49] Interesting. Why do you
[19:51] think what does AI like? Why is that
[19:54] like that with with AI not being as
[19:56] profitable?
[19:58] Yeah, I I think that you know um
[20:00] certainly it's a long game, right? Um
[20:02] you could have you know could look at a
[20:04] company like Amazon that was you know
[20:06] losing money for for for many many many
[20:08] years and um obviously it's worked out
[20:11] great for them but in the case of AI
[20:13] right now it's uh certainly the
[20:14] long-term play that they will be able to
[20:16] figure out this business u model over
[20:19] time right um for example open AAI has a
[20:22] really unique product chat you can see I
[20:24] use it you know on almost a daily basis
[20:27] currently and um they lost you know I
[20:30] think somewhere in the range of 5
[20:31] billion dollars last year. Um, and I
[20:33] think that they have a total investment
[20:35] in that company of about $20 billion
[20:37] with, you know, um, very little, you
[20:40] know, reoccurring revenue to show for
[20:43] that investment. So certainly it's on
[20:45] the long-term um, play, but as you have
[20:48] more and more of these competitors, um,
[20:50] you know, enter the space with something
[20:52] related to a, you know, AI, it's I'm of
[20:54] the opinion that it's kind of a race to
[20:56] zero as to, you know, who can offer um,
[20:59] what services and whatnot. They'll have
[21:00] some specialties and in this and that,
[21:02] but if you look for example um at like a
[21:05] a Google search for example, a Google
[21:07] search has practically a real world cost
[21:10] of zero in order to do that, you know,
[21:14] um to do that search. Um, while it's
[21:17] significantly more currently for AI and
[21:19] it will inevitably be a little bit more
[21:21] over time for AI just with the compute
[21:23] involved, um, I think it's safe to say
[21:25] that it's it's it's hard to forecast
[21:27] where, you know, some of these companies
[21:29] could potentially um, have some
[21:32] significant revenues to support their
[21:34] current investment. Bitcoin mining
[21:36] basically has to always stay on a
[21:39] profitable size otherwise Bitcoin miners
[21:41] will shut down and this and then the
[21:43] difficulty will will come down.
[21:44] Basically, it's it's a it's it's a it's
[21:47] a forced profit uh that's baked into
[21:50] their code, right? Exactly. Bitcoin
[21:53] miners, you know, the machines are
[21:54] constantly getting um you know, more
[21:56] efficient over time, although we're
[21:58] starting to see some maybe some
[21:59] diminishing returns on um how much
[22:02] better the new equipment is actually
[22:03] getting. Um but yeah, you're certainly
[22:06] right that um machines are it's it's a
[22:09] very simple function. You have your
[22:10] input cost of electricity and you have
[22:12] the network difficulty and the price of
[22:15] Bitcoin and then the the only other
[22:17] variable would be the block reward which
[22:18] changes you know approximately every
[22:20] four years and those are very easy
[22:22] inputs to be able to calculate and um
[22:26] you know there's your your business
[22:27] model there. Super interesting. Ju just
[22:31] on a quick note um uh only because I put
[22:34] that tweet out I think yesterday and and
[22:37] it got like for some reason over 50,000
[22:40] views and people were discussing really
[22:41] really heavily on that. I just put out
[22:43] the thesis that I think um uh hash rate
[22:47] leads price and I I wasn't aware how
[22:50] many how many different opinion opinions
[22:53] and and how controversial that that take
[22:56] is because it was not a big take of
[22:58] mine. How do you look at the correlation
[23:00] between the Bitcoin price and and hash
[23:03] rate uh and and and that Yeah, I would
[23:07] agree with that, you know, 100%. Um I I
[23:10] I think if you look at the hash rate,
[23:12] the hash rate is the signal through the
[23:15] noise, if you will, in in in the world
[23:17] because you can see all of the
[23:18] investment that is being made. And um
[23:21] you know, especially at this point in
[23:23] time, it's a significant investment. um
[23:25] you know we're approaching you know 800
[23:27] 900 xahash um uh globally and the
[23:31] additional um you know investment to be
[23:34] able to bring on um you know 1% or 2% of
[23:37] the total overall hash rate is a
[23:39] significant you know amount of capital.
[23:42] So, I think it's a really good way to um
[23:45] see, like I said, the signal through
[23:47] through the noise, if you will. And I
[23:50] would agree that, you know, hash uh hash
[23:51] rate would, you know, kind of lead price
[23:53] um because you're you're seeing um you
[23:56] know, the businesses prepare for the
[23:58] future and investing in, you know, these
[24:00] sites and the equipment, preparing for,
[24:03] you know, that future price appreciation
[24:04] of Bitcoin. How is it actually impacting
[24:08] the the business when the Bitcoin price
[24:11] moves up or down? Like how how how much
[24:15] more
[24:16] profitable do does a minor get if the
[24:19] Bitcoin price now goes up? I think today
[24:21] I mean this will come out almost a month
[24:23] later but today is I think six or 7%
[24:26] uptick day. Uh and and some days maybe
[24:29] like a down day. Do you see uh the the
[24:32] same cycles with the price that impacts
[24:35] the the the business or is is that not
[24:38] that important? Yeah. Well, uh uh you
[24:40] know as it relates to the profitability
[24:42] of mining um you know certainly when
[24:44] you're when you're mining with us um you
[24:46] have a fixed input on a daily basis
[24:48] which is your cost of electricity right
[24:50] so you have a a fixed cost right now
[24:53] most of the machines are call it about
[24:55] $6 a day in fixed cost for each machine
[24:57] to operate. Um certainly if if the price
[25:00] of of Bitcoin were to double tomorrow,
[25:03] the revenue that you're going to be
[25:04] producing is going to be, you know,
[25:06] twice as uh twice as much essentially
[25:09] while still maintaining that fixed cost
[25:11] of electricity. So the interesting side
[25:13] of mining is where you can actually see
[25:16] um you know, if you were to compare, you
[25:18] know, buying versus mining, um today
[25:22] you're able to produce Bitcoin at a
[25:24] discount to spot. And if you were to
[25:26] look at buying Bitcoin today, say you
[25:28] were to buy $10 worth of Bitcoin today
[25:31] um on an exchange, um that's going to
[25:33] get you $10 today in Bitcoin. And then
[25:35] if the price doubles, you know, that
[25:37] same $10 is now only going to buy you $5
[25:40] equivalent of the same amount of Bitcoin
[25:42] versus if you're mining, you have your
[25:44] fixed cost to operate the machine on a
[25:46] daily basis. And let's say that you're
[25:48] generating, you know, $12 a day in
[25:50] revenue for that particular machine. All
[25:52] of a sudden, if price doubles, your
[25:53] fixed cost is still $6, but now you're
[25:56] getting $24 of revenue versus 12. So, um
[26:01] certainly nobody can predict price and
[26:03] nobody can predict hash rate. Uh you
[26:05] know, I'm of the opinion I'm very
[26:07] long-term optimistic on Bitcoin. Um and
[26:11] that that's just kind of the differences
[26:13] there between mining and buying spot.
[26:16] So, it's almost better for mining
[26:19] Bitcoin if the if the price runs up and
[26:23] uh if the price goes down, it's it's
[26:26] better for those who who buy Bitcoin. Is
[26:29] is that a fair assumption? Yeah, I think
[26:31] I think if you look just, you know,
[26:32] generally speaking, timing of course
[26:35] plays an important role if you're
[26:36] buying, you know, any asset, right? um
[26:38] whether that be spot bitcoin, whether
[26:40] that be you know bitcoin mining
[26:42] machines, whether that be you know uh
[26:44] gold or Apple stock, whatever it might
[26:46] be. So um I think you know kind of
[26:49] related back to uh our earlier point is
[26:52] that forced dollar cost average um that
[26:55] those machines are going to be producing
[26:57] bitcoin for you every single day no
[26:59] matter what the price is um is something
[27:01] that we've seen to be really beneficial.
[27:03] Let's take a break for a moment and
[27:05] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[27:07] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[27:10] watches. Those watches are the most
[27:12] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[27:15] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[27:19] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[27:21] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[27:24] watch collections. You have the date of
[27:27] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[27:30] there and of course also the block
[27:32] height and which epoch we are currently
[27:35] in. I love the level of detail they put
[27:38] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[27:41] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[27:44] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[27:46] love those watches so so much. And now
[27:49] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[27:52] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[27:54] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[27:56] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[27:58] first way is you put it on a hardware
[28:00] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[28:03] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[28:06] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[28:09] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[28:12] if you check out the link in the
[28:14] description, you even get 5% off if you
[28:17] use the code Robin. And the second way
[28:19] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[28:23] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[28:26] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[28:29] They will personalize for you a
[28:31] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[28:34] your individual situation. They will
[28:37] show you how you can secure your own
[28:39] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[28:41] enough. You also have to keep all your
[28:43] devices secure. One topic that is
[28:46] overlooked often is the inheritance
[28:48] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[28:51] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[28:54] a plan for that in place already? And
[28:56] last but not least, if you're in a
[28:58] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[29:01] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[29:03] that, head over to the
[29:07] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[29:10] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[29:13] be for the first time ever speaking at
[29:15] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[29:18] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[29:20] really looking forward to seeing all of
[29:22] you there. You can get your ticket in
[29:25] the link down in the description of
[29:27] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[29:29] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[29:33] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[29:35] there. Yeah, it's uh something that I've
[29:37] seen um with with my business. It's I'm
[29:41] not doing Bitcoin mining. I'm just doing
[29:43] the podcast. So there's uh income coming
[29:45] in in fiat and income coming in at in
[29:47] Bitcoin and there's uh expenses coming
[29:50] out in Bitcoin and expenses coming out
[29:52] in fiat. And right now since the last
[29:54] couple of months I have this really nice
[29:57] split for some reason where I don't have
[29:59] to exchange one for the other. I can pay
[30:03] my fiat bills with with fiat and pay my
[30:05] Bitcoin bills with with Bitcoin, which
[30:06] is awesome that currently it's working
[30:08] out like that, which really detached me
[30:12] from the Bitcoin price at a certain
[30:14] because I'm I'm no longer looking for
[30:16] buying Bitcoin. Uh I'm no longer looking
[30:18] for selling Bitcoin. I'm just getting
[30:21] paid. And this is just like it's like
[30:23] there pre-agreed. I cannot change that.
[30:26] And I I pay it. It's also pre-agreed and
[30:29] I I cannot really change it. Yeah. maybe
[30:31] like 5 days more or less, but doesn't
[30:33] really change a lot. So, this getting
[30:36] away from the Bitcoin price and
[30:38] detaching yourself emotionally, no
[30:40] matter if you do it with mining or
[30:42] disabling or like whatever your strategy
[30:44] is, there's a real value in there. Also,
[30:47] the peace of mind of that all of a
[30:49] sudden not being emotionally detach
[30:51] emotionally attached on the Bitcoin
[30:53] price if it it's like 95K tomorrow or
[30:57] 85k like who who cares?
[31:00] Right. Exactly. And that's um you know
[31:02] just goes to show if you can remove the
[31:04] emotions and just you know let let
[31:08] Bitcoin do its thing um it's it's it's
[31:10] pretty amazing to see you know uh to see
[31:13] how that those returns work. So
[31:16] absolutely. Um how do you see the the
[31:19] future of mining? Maybe let's uh let's
[31:22] put it that way. Um we have seen an
[31:24] evolution of mining really rapidly where
[31:27] in the beginning you can just mine with
[31:28] a computer like 50 bitcoins a day. Uh
[31:31] now you need a whole operation to to get
[31:34] to 50 bitcoin uh per per day. It's no
[31:37] longer possible with with a MacBook or
[31:39] something like that. So with with that
[31:41] and we have now like big companies
[31:43] publicly traded companies like we have
[31:45] really a whole big industry on its own
[31:48] that is mining Bitcoin. How do you see
[31:51] that evolving over the next 5 10 years?
[31:55] Maybe also with the aspect of of solo
[31:57] mining that we talked in the in the
[31:58] beginning a little bit with with Bitex.
[32:01] Yeah. So um you know I think especially
[32:04] as it relates to like the public
[32:05] companies um you were seeing um a lot of
[32:08] these public companies shift and kind of
[32:10] you know start to slow down maybe their
[32:12] expansion as it relates to um Bitcoin
[32:14] mining. Um, Riot, for example, has a one
[32:18] gigawatt facility that they um completed
[32:21] about 40% of that was supposed to be all
[32:23] one gigawatt was supposed to be for
[32:24] Bitcoin mining and now they're looking
[32:26] for a hyperscaler um you know AI uh to
[32:29] come in and take the remaining 600
[32:30] megawatts. So I think that you know
[32:33] currently with the the demand for AI
[32:35] especially as it relates to the public
[32:37] companies you know core scientific
[32:40] obviously is completely transitioning to
[32:42] AI you know they have some large
[32:43] contracts with coreweave that naturally
[32:46] um is going to reduce buyers in the
[32:48] market um at a very large scale and I
[32:51] think potentially um be a benefit to
[32:53] some of the the smaller operators and
[32:55] you know the private companies that are
[32:57] operating in this space. Um, so I see
[33:00] obviously the Bitcoin network is going
[33:01] to still continue to grow. Um, but as
[33:03] you're seeing, um, some of these larger
[33:06] companies step away and, you know, pivot
[33:07] to AI. I think it's going to, um, you
[33:10] know, there's a lot of conversation out
[33:11] there about, you know, hash rate growth
[33:13] will kind of continue to same maybe as
[33:16] like the expected um, you know, uh,
[33:19] average compounded growth of Bitcoin is
[33:20] expected to kind of slowly diminish over
[33:22] time. You would kind of expect the same
[33:24] as it relates to hash rate growth and
[33:26] that's what we've seen. So, um I think
[33:28] it'll be a good opportunity for the long
[33:30] term, um for, you know, some private
[33:32] miners and, you know, companies who can
[33:34] operate efficiently. Um and I I think
[33:38] there's a there's a very long-term
[33:40] business here. I think, you know,
[33:40] Bitcoin is going to continue to grow in
[33:43] market cap as it relates to, you know,
[33:46] all the other assets in the world out
[33:47] there and this will be, you know, great,
[33:49] you know, commodity to um to produce um
[33:52] over the long term. Absolutely. And I
[33:54] want to get later a little bit on on
[33:56] your uh case for Bitcoin, how why are
[33:59] you bullish on stuff like that, but it's
[34:00] really interesting to talk about uh EI
[34:03] and Bitcoin mining. I never thought
[34:05] because you say like that AI is kind of
[34:08] buying up some demand with that. The
[34:10] bigger ones are sometimes doing EI and
[34:13] Bitcoin mining. This allows the smaller
[34:15] ones to come up. In a way, I mean, maybe
[34:18] that's a unfair assumption, but I will
[34:20] just put it out there. In a way, AI is
[34:23] decentralizing the Bitcoin n mining
[34:25] network more. That's a great way to look
[34:28] at it.
[34:29] Interesting. Yeah, I love that. Yeah.
[34:32] Um, so now to to the question of um
[34:36] what's your thesis behind Bitcoin? Why
[34:38] are you bullish on Bitcoin? Like why are
[34:41] you uh uh big on Bitcoin? Obviously,
[34:44] when when you're mining Bitcoin? Yeah.
[34:46] Yeah. Well, I think you know um uh I
[34:50] like to take the really really base
[34:51] assumption that markets move to what
[34:53] works most efficient, right? Um and if
[34:56] you look at the, you know, society as a
[34:59] whole globally and we zoom out, you
[35:01] know, um on a very very large time
[35:03] frame, gold has been society's, you
[35:06] know, store of value asset for thousands
[35:08] of years. And it has it's been that way
[35:11] because of the properties that it has,
[35:13] right? it's durable, it's portable, it's
[35:15] divisible, so on and so forth. All the
[35:17] same properties that Bitcoin has.
[35:19] However, if you um look, Bitcoin is a
[35:22] digital form of gold um along with some
[35:25] other additional properties, you know,
[35:26] such as the the network and and whatnot
[35:29] that make it a a much better alternative
[35:31] than gold. And if we look, you know,
[35:34] over a really really large time scale,
[35:36] um we're still in the, you know, we're
[35:39] still in the very first inning. uh the
[35:41] first pitch hasn't even been thrown yet
[35:43] as it relates to the digital world,
[35:44] right? And I think over time it's just a
[35:49] it's a very good, you know, at least my
[35:52] opinion is um it's very clear that
[35:55] things are moving to a more digital
[35:57] world. And this particular um you know
[36:00] asset that has um a lot of unique
[36:03] properties that the world has never seen
[36:05] um for um is is only going to grow in
[36:09] market share. And it only makes sense to
[36:11] be traded as you know a global currency
[36:14] um that people can you know save their
[36:17] their um you know the fruits of their
[36:19] labor in this asset that will actually
[36:21] maintain its purchasing power. Um and
[36:23] and really you look at a world that's
[36:25] you know uh you know everything divided
[36:27] by 21 million you know essentially yeah
[36:30] it's the Bitcoin will become the the
[36:33] base layer of everything and and will
[36:35] then be be the one asset everything is
[36:39] compared towards that that that future
[36:41] is so exciting there's so many ch
[36:44] there's so many changes coming w with
[36:46] that and maybe
[36:49] uh how old are you you seem pretty young
[36:52] still even So you you have uh done a lot
[36:54] of companies. Yeah, I'm 28. So I'll be
[36:58] I'll be 29 in August. Really? How has uh
[37:01] Bitcoin kind of impacted your life and
[37:04] and and how you run your business? Yeah.
[37:07] Well, I think you know, especially when
[37:09] I started in business, um you know, when
[37:13] I first started in business in the cell
[37:14] phone repair stores, my what was drilled
[37:16] into my brain ever since I was very
[37:18] young was you need to save money, right?
[37:20] You need to save money. um to be able to
[37:23] you know buy a house and and do all
[37:26] these other sorts of things that you
[37:26] want to do in life you have to you have
[37:28] to save your money and um I think you
[37:31] know at the at the base it's a very you
[37:33] know uh very good approach however when
[37:36] you know when you start to get into the
[37:38] weeds of things and you realize well
[37:40] saving money you're actually you know
[37:42] having this hidden tax every single day
[37:45] of of inflation right and and the the
[37:47] base fiat currency is you know your
[37:50] purchasing power is being inflated Hey,
[37:52] that's something that it it it takes
[37:53] some time to understand and really
[37:56] experience that. Um, so you know, as we
[37:58] were growing our cell phone repair
[38:00] business, we were we were saving and
[38:01] then we would save that cash and we
[38:03] would reinvest it. Um, but really we
[38:05] should have been saving in a a hard
[38:07] asset, right? We should have been saving
[38:09] in Bitcoin and you know that would have
[38:12] um the fruits of our labor would have
[38:14] been our our purchasing power and our
[38:16] labor would have been protected over
[38:18] time. And so I think that's first and
[38:20] foremost that's that's the first thing
[38:22] that Bitcoin did was really help to
[38:23] understand you know how how the system
[38:27] works and how broken the fiat system
[38:30] is and um really just puts you in a
[38:34] position to um you know think more long
[38:37] term and and and have a really good um
[38:40] you know really good financial
[38:42] responsibility I'd say.
[38:44] Did you save before with your cell phone
[38:48] repair shop? Did you save in US dollar
[38:50] or stocks or something else before
[38:52] Bitcoin? Yep. Just US dollars in the
[38:54] bank account and you know looking back
[38:56] that's uh not the not the proper way to
[38:59] do it. But um uh and and there's always
[39:03] obviously risk in these things and
[39:06] volatility so on and so forth. But you
[39:07] know generally speaking um if you're
[39:09] just putting your money in your bank
[39:11] account it's getting inflated away. uh
[39:13] every single day you're losing
[39:14] purchasing power. Um so there's a reason
[39:16] that um you know hardly anybody keeps
[39:18] their cash in the bank. They they take
[39:20] the cash and they get it out as quickly
[39:21] as they possibly can. Um that's why you
[39:23] you know you see the stocks with crazy
[39:25] valuations and so on and so forth is
[39:27] everybody's looking for what's the best
[39:28] alternative to holding this asset that's
[39:31] losing purchasing power every single
[39:32] day. And now obviously you you you save
[39:36] with simple mining in in in Bitcoin I
[39:38] guess. Yeah, we operate on a Bitcoin
[39:39] standard. What what does it you still
[39:41] have a bank account I guess to pay
[39:42] electricity or you you you are fortunate
[39:45] to pay in Bitcoin. So hopefully someday
[39:48] you know we'll be able to exchange and
[39:50] and pay our you know utility companies
[39:52] in directly in Bitcoin. But no we we
[39:54] still have to you know transact um a
[39:58] decent portion in fiat. However we do we
[40:00] do accept um uh payments in Bitcoin. So
[40:04] um you know we try to everything that we
[40:05] look at is through the lens of Bitcoin
[40:07] right? um even though we might be paying
[40:09] out fiat for some expenses, it all you
[40:11] know inevitably gets denominated on our
[40:13] side in Bitcoin where you know we fully
[40:15] operate on a Bitcoin standard and and
[40:17] that's our that's our ultimate goal. So
[40:20] interesting. I'm so interested in in in
[40:22] businesses and the intersection with
[40:24] business and and and Bitcoin because if
[40:26] you're a business and you're totally
[40:28] just on US dollar, you are really
[40:31] incentivized to find some some new kind
[40:34] of thing that you put your money into,
[40:36] which can be good and bad depending on
[40:39] on if you are able to find really great
[40:41] opportunities. With Bitcoin mining, you
[40:43] found something good. And if you have
[40:46] Bitcoin as your default savings vehicle,
[40:52] this is pretty rapidly adopting and this
[40:54] is then also pretty rapidly
[40:58] growing. Then you really have to think,
[41:00] oh, do I do I keep the savings now in
[41:03] Bitcoin or do I build a new site or do I
[41:07] do how do you how do you think about
[41:09] that? Yeah, I think I think it forces
[41:11] you to really look at things through the
[41:14] lens of um from a from a financially
[41:16] responsible, you know, position and um
[41:19] you know, do we do we make this
[41:20] investment or do we, you know, just
[41:22] continue to hold Bitcoin, right? So, and
[41:24] I think it's a combination combination
[41:26] of both. You know, we want to, you know,
[41:28] certainly continue to build out um you
[41:31] know, our Bitcoin treasury, if you will,
[41:33] um while also expanding and growing our
[41:35] business, too. So, um, and that's kind
[41:37] of, you know, as it relates to, um,
[41:39] Bitcoin mining, you can you can look at,
[41:41] um, the advantages of of Bitcoin mining.
[41:44] So, um, if you have a business and and
[41:46] you have, you know, uh, taxes do, you
[41:48] could look at this as a potential way to
[41:50] reduce your tax liability, right? And
[41:52] then you can also operate this as a
[41:53] business, produce Bitcoin as an asset,
[41:56] you know, um, uh, you can deduct the
[41:59] expenses and then continue to grow your
[42:01] Bitcoin stack, for example. So yeah, the
[42:04] the the tax strategies around Bitcoin
[42:06] mining that might be also an interesting
[42:08] thing because I think uh that's doesn't
[42:11] get talked enough about especially with
[42:14] with young entrepreneurs maybe they have
[42:16] some I mean I guess even in even for my
[42:19] podcasting business if if there's profit
[42:21] coming up uh it would be only logical uh
[42:24] to find something for that to to
[42:26] reinvest it and and Bitcoin mining might
[42:28] be something interesting to to look at.
[42:31] Uh how many of your your clients is is
[42:34] is tax as a a reason for for for for
[42:37] doing Bitcoin mining? Oh yeah, certainly
[42:40] not all of them, but you know, it's a
[42:42] it's a big um we have a lot of business
[42:44] owners that are clients. Um we work with
[42:46] a lot of, you know, large private and
[42:47] public companies um that are doing this,
[42:49] you know, as a business. So um yeah, the
[42:52] tax advantages can be can be good. I'm
[42:54] not a I'm not a CPA, you know, certainly
[42:56] recommend everybody talk to their own
[42:58] tax professional and whatnot, but um
[43:00] yeah, there's certainly some tax
[43:02] advantages um in this business. Super
[43:05] super interesting. I I just love that
[43:07] topic too much. It's really cool. Um how
[43:10] do you think Bitcoin will impact uh our
[43:14] world outside of of of energy and
[43:17] Bitcoin mining that we talked about? How
[43:19] how do you think Bitcoin will impact uh
[43:21] how we live together?
[43:23] Yeah. Well, you know, um, we we kind of
[43:26] live in our own little echo chamber
[43:28] where, you know, we see a lot of these
[43:29] things and we see the we see the game
[43:31] theory play out over time. You know,
[43:33] certainly the last few years where um,
[43:36] you know, when we started the company,
[43:37] our bank account got shut down when we
[43:39] first started and now you're starting to
[43:41] see, you know, Bitcoin held by state
[43:43] pension funds and and you know,
[43:45] governments acquiring Bitcoin,
[43:47] governments mining Bitcoin, so on and so
[43:48] forth. I I think you just naturally
[43:51] speaking um there's a lot of additional
[43:53] benefits that will it's kind of you know
[43:55] fix the money fix the world right is is
[43:57] is a common phrase. So if you don't have
[44:01] broken money and you don't have all of
[44:03] those other sorts of things the world
[44:05] while not perfect it starts to look like
[44:07] a lot better place for sure
[44:10] it it kind of fixes the incentives and
[44:12] and makes
[44:13] it better to to make take better
[44:17] decisions. It's also from a business
[44:19] perspective, but also from a a personal
[44:21] perspective. All of a sudden, it gives
[44:23] you back the capabilities to to think
[44:26] clearly because you're not rushed into
[44:28] anything. If we look back and and just
[44:30] having the savings as US dollar, you
[44:33] almost kind of rushed into let's let's
[44:36] get something new. If you have Bitcoin,
[44:38] you're like, okay, let's step back.
[44:40] Bitcoin is already really good. Before
[44:42] we jump on and make a new venture, let's
[44:45] think really clearly about is that new
[44:47] venture really worth it or not? Yeah, I
[44:51] think you could even relate this, you
[44:52] know, from a really simple perspective.
[44:54] If you related it to like the treasury,
[44:56] for example, Treasury, it's really easy
[44:58] for them to issue, you know, issue new
[45:00] debt. Uh they can print the currency
[45:02] itself to repay that back, you know,
[45:04] debt back over time. if they were to
[45:06] issue debt in Bitcoin, denominated
[45:08] Bitcoin, that immediately changes, you
[45:11] know, um the decision-making process
[45:14] because if um if the US government were
[45:16] to issue debt for a 100,000 Bitcoin and
[45:18] they had to pay that 100,000 Bitcoin
[45:20] back in Bitcoin over time, um I think
[45:24] they would very quickly change their
[45:25] decision-making on what they're spending
[45:27] spending money on. And um that that I
[45:30] think that forced financial
[45:32] responsibility that Bitcoin naturally um
[45:36] causes you to do is a really good
[45:38] benefit you know whether it's on an
[45:40] individual basis whether it's on a um
[45:43] you know business level or even the
[45:46] government interesting how do you think
[45:48] uh it will impact governments thesis and
[45:50] I I don't know if you even have that
[45:52] thesis because there are different uh
[45:54] there are two types of bitcoiners those
[45:56] who think that uh central banks will
[45:58] will always be like there will always be
[46:00] some government token or some some fiat
[46:02] currencies those who
[46:04] don't let's go first in that otherwise
[46:07] to the second question doesn't make
[46:08] sense do you think uh there will always
[46:11] be feared or is there a chance even like
[46:13] 100 years down the road that that we all
[46:15] that we get rid of that fear currency
[46:18] yeah I think I think you know it's going
[46:20] to take um I think it's going to take
[46:22] some time but I do eventually think that
[46:23] bitcoin will be the you know global
[46:25] reserve currency
[46:27] um it's not going to be with it's not
[46:30] going to be a a straight you know nice
[46:32] easy road it's going to be a bumpy road
[46:34] lots of curves so on and so forth um but
[46:37] I think just naturally that is the
[46:38] progression of where this is all going
[46:40] right and um that will be a really good
[46:43] situation
[46:45] in will there still be some governments
[46:47] that will try and you know this and that
[46:49] it might not be 100% of the world that
[46:51] will be perfect but um it's it's it's
[46:55] kind of the game theory of anybody who
[46:57] is trying to do that is going to get
[46:58] left behind, right? Um and certainly I
[47:02] think that there's a a natural
[47:03] progression that this should take a
[47:05] little bit of time to play out because
[47:06] if it happens tomorrow if if the grow if
[47:09] the world is on a you know um Bitcoin
[47:12] global reserve currency status um as of
[47:15] you know
[47:17] 2026 situation is probably not looking
[47:20] very good in the world. I think that
[47:21] there this is going to take a long time
[47:23] to play out and and and if it happens
[47:25] rapidly that probably means bad things
[47:27] are happening in the world, right?
[47:29] Absolutely. I always bring the Titanic
[47:31] example up. You don't want the Titanic
[47:34] to sink like extremely fast. You want
[47:37] the uh savings boats and the lifeboats
[47:40] coming and bring the people into safety.
[47:43] So fiat being the Titanic and the uh
[47:47] safety and the land next to it being
[47:49] Bitcoin. So I think the we always say
[47:54] like oh like the omega candle and and
[47:56] and all all of those things but we also
[47:59] have to think about the implications
[48:01] what it means if Bitcoin actually shoots
[48:03] up let's say we have now uh uh let's say
[48:07] Bitcoin shoots up in May or June this
[48:10] year to $1 million. What are the
[48:13] implications of that? Because the
[48:15] network didn't grow that quickly
[48:17] probably not. So probably means the US
[48:20] dollar or the fiat currencies really got
[48:22] devalued and then your family and your
[48:26] loved ones also are hurting because they
[48:29] they might not have all uh all the
[48:31] Bitcoin standard like you do, right?
[48:34] It's it's it's a it's a little bit of a
[48:37] scary thought to think about. If Bitcoin
[48:39] is a million dollars, you know, a few
[48:40] months from now, it probably means a lot
[48:42] is wrong with the world. The, you know,
[48:43] fiat, the underlying fiat currency has
[48:45] completely collapsed. You know, the uh
[48:47] trillion dollar
[48:48] Zimbabwe, you know, uh paper bill, um
[48:53] and it's a bad situation. So, I think I
[48:54] think a s I think this is going to play
[48:56] out over a very long period of time.
[48:58] Now, whether that's um you know, 50 or
[49:01] 100 years, it's it's anybody's best
[49:03] guess at that point in time. But I I do
[49:05] think that this is going to be a very
[49:06] slow gradual transition, which is
[49:09] um probably the best way to for it to
[49:12] happen. Um you know, certainly you'd
[49:14] like to see it a little bit sooner
[49:16] rather than later. Just United States,
[49:18] for example, 30 $37 trillion in debt. Uh
[49:22] that that's that that debt is going to
[49:23] be continued to be inflated away
[49:24] forever. And you
[49:26] know, it's it's just a better situation
[49:29] if you're operating, you know, in a
[49:30] fiscally responsible situation. um you
[49:33] know managing your balance sheet and you
[49:35] know how much debt you're taking on and
[49:36] so on and so forth. Absolutely 100%. And
[49:40] now if we are in this uh future where
[49:42] there aren't any uh central banks being
[49:47] far far away from each other from from
[49:49] us but like we are in that future. How
[49:51] do you think governments organize
[49:53] themselves or we organize ourselves
[49:56] without the ability to to print money?
[50:01] Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think I think the
[50:02] government kind of operates um like a
[50:04] business at that point in time. It it
[50:05] really evaluates all of the options. Um
[50:08] you know, what does it have coming in
[50:11] for revenue? Um you know, who who likes
[50:13] paying taxes obviously, but you know, I
[50:16] personally at least like the fire
[50:17] department and the police department and
[50:18] you know, good roads to drive on, so on
[50:20] and so forth. Um, so you're going to
[50:22] have some revenue coming in and you're
[50:24] going to have um some some expenses and
[50:26] then you're going to have opportunities
[50:27] to invest and I think that forces um
[50:31] intelligent investment um in the
[50:33] country, right? It's it's my opinion is
[50:35] it's just like a business at that point.
[50:37] That's a good it's like it it brings
[50:39] back government as as a service
[50:42] basically. It's a weird term, but it
[50:44] it's like that's what it's supposed to
[50:47] be. Yeah, it is going to be again and
[50:51] not that big overhead that controls all
[50:54] the aspects of your life. No, it's like
[50:56] actually there to to serve there to uh
[51:00] protect the borders, there to uh make a
[51:03] safety net for those uh who who who
[51:05] really can't and and then have like fire
[51:07] department and and all those things.
[51:09] Yeah, I'm I'm a big fan of that and I
[51:11] don't think we need to have so much
[51:14] taxes and so many uh money printing for
[51:17] that. we can probably do it way more
[51:19] efficient, right? No, exactly. And
[51:21] that's kind of the you know, I'm a big
[51:23] believer in the free market will will do
[51:25] its thing and um you know when when the
[51:29] government is intervening with the free
[51:31] market and and you know uh printing the
[51:34] currency and making you know
[51:35] malinvestments, it's um it's not a it's
[51:38] not a long-term good situation, right?
[51:40] It's it's a bad investment. Absolutely.
[51:43] Um I ask each and every one of my guests
[51:46] the same question and the question is
[51:48] what can we learn from you besides
[51:51] Bitcoin? Can we learn from me besides
[51:53] Bitcoin? Um
[51:55] h it's a good question. I would say that
[51:59] um you know as it relates to to simple
[52:03] mining you know we're just trying to um
[52:06] we're trying to offer a really great
[52:07] customer experience. We're trying to be
[52:08] the best provider in the world for for
[52:10] this type of business. and we have a lot
[52:11] of educational content on our business
[52:13] that isn't necessarily specifically
[52:14] related to Bitcoin. Um, you know, some
[52:17] of it has to do with energy and in the
[52:18] grid and and how, you know, renewable
[52:20] energy and these sorts of things work.
[52:22] So, I'd say that'd be one, you know,
[52:23] one, um, you know, resource that we
[52:25] could be if you're interested in
[52:27] learning more about energy, the grid,
[52:29] and, you know, what is this AI thing and
[52:31] how does it even work and how are the,
[52:33] you know, data centers different and so
[52:35] on and so forth, that would, you know,
[52:36] we could be a good resource there.
[52:38] Really, really cool. Um, we have an end
[52:40] routine in the podcast where the the
[52:42] previous guest is asking a question for
[52:44] the next guest without knowing who the
[52:46] next guest actually is. And this is an
[52:48] interesting one. Uh, because the
[52:50] previous guest asked you the question,
[52:52] is Bitcoin a form of consciousness?
[52:55] Is Bitcoin a form of consciousness? Hm,
[52:58] it's a good question. Well, I would say
[53:01] almost yes. It's kind of like um gold at
[53:04] that point in time. like why is why is
[53:07] society chose this shiny yellow rock to
[53:10] be our currency? There's, you know,
[53:13] there would be plenty of alternatives.
[53:14] It's kind of that was the selection
[53:17] based upon the um uh based upon the
[53:20] properties that it had and it just kind
[53:21] of naturally happened over time. So,
[53:24] it's a good question. I've never been
[53:25] asked that one, but I would have to I'd
[53:27] have to say in in a roundabout way. Yes.
[53:30] Yeah. That's why I love those uh the
[53:33] Android team because there are questions
[53:35] coming in that I might not even have
[53:38] thought of. I have never asked that
[53:40] question before any any guest
[53:42] and it's it's definitely something uh
[53:45] might not be suitable or might be
[53:47] suitable for the next guest. Really
[53:49] cool. Um yeah, thank you so much, Adam.
[53:51] Um before I let you go, where can people
[53:52] find you, ask you questions and and
[53:54] reach out to you? Yeah, you can find us
[53:56] on uh LinkedIn. Um I'm on LinkedIn, Adam
[53:59] Haynes. Um our our uh company Simple
[54:01] Mining is on LinkedIn. You can find us
