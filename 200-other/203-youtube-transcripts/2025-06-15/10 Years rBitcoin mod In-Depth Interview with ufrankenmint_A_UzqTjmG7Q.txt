[00:00] I applied to be like an our Bitcoin
[00:02] moderator and I was shocked but they
[00:03] said yeah sure and so yeah I became like
[00:06] an our Bitcoin moderator on Reddit
[00:08] 2014 do you have any like personal
[00:11] highlights in the community that you're
[00:13] like oh this this time like maybe 2017
[00:16] if the bless Wars or like 2020 when
[00:19] Michael saor came in like is there any
[00:21] like um point that you point to that's
[00:23] like was a really highlight for you in
[00:25] the Bitcoin Community till now yeah I
[00:27] guess maybe 200
[00:30] like early 2013 I suppose um that's when
[00:33] I was um like I applied to be like a r
[00:37] Bitcoin moderator and I was shocked but
[00:39] they said yeah sure and so yeah I became
[00:42] like an our Bitcoin moderator on Reddit
[00:44] uh
[00:46] 2014 oh so like on on the subreddit of
[00:50] uh Bitcoin uh you you've been a mod oh
[00:53] how's I heard a lot about the 2017 time
[00:57] so have you been a moderator since
[01:00] through ever since yeah yeah that's
[01:02] right how was the can can you tell us a
[01:05] little bit about the 2017 time I heard
[01:08] it was pretty hilarious uh and pretty um
[01:12] hard to understand like the different
[01:13] sides coming into Bitcoin and and doing
[01:15] all the stuff is the was it also for you
[01:19] yeah uh no I always say it was reallyy
[01:21] difficult uh it's kind of funny you
[01:22] bring that up I would say for real was
[01:25] like 2015 2016 were kind of a bit more
[01:29] trying uh specifically like in that area
[01:32] like within kind of Reddit and Reddit
[01:34] moderation and subreddits and the reason
[01:36] why was because like there was like a
[01:37] common Narrative of you
[01:40] know you guys are gu Keepers for
[01:42] information and you're trying to
[01:43] basically censor people from wanting to
[01:45] have healthy discourse about block sizes
[01:48] because we should raise the block size
[01:50] it's obvious we need to raise the block
[01:52] size so that everybody can have
[01:53] scalability in transactions and cheaper
[01:56] Fe and it's clearly the best solution
[01:59] and like that's neither that was what we
[02:00] were getting like constantly right like
[02:02] from a lot of angles and the thing is it
[02:05] it wasn't clear if it's like this is a
[02:06] few different con short of people that
[02:08] are just sibling us with like all this
[02:11] or is it that it's in fact a larger
[02:13] Community effort of wanting to like add
[02:15] this Narrative of you at we need to Rose
[02:16] the blocks so that we can have cheaper
[02:18] fees that we can have you know copies
[02:19] for Bitcoin all day on chain right and
[02:22] uh yeah that was a trying time and so I
[02:26] remember what happened was like kind of
[02:28] early on like got red by specific
[02:31] moderator say hey we should
[02:33] uh kind of allow disc course to happen
[02:36] fing the da you know discussions but
[02:40] don't make it contentious and you know
[02:42] remove that like get rid of it like it's
[02:44] just it's noise and at first I was a
[02:46] little bit of disagreement with that
[02:47] about it but then like kind of talking
[02:49] to them back and forth I and talking
[02:51] with the other moderators back and forth
[02:52] I realized that yeah it makes sense
[02:54] because like it says we're individuals
[02:56] volunteering do our thing and like we
[03:00] were not the most sated to say this is
[03:02] what should be done that's what should
[03:03] be done but we do see that when we go
[03:06] for like a quick knee-jerk reactionary
[03:09] maneuver you have like unforeseen
[03:11] consequences that will we can't be a Ser
[03:14] like never ever be assured of and so
[03:17] that really kind of had you know us like
[03:19] I said moving threads about contention
[03:22] and pretty much year CL is like you know
[03:25] we're uh you know we're North Korea here
[03:27] like and we were batting all like
[03:29] dissenting a right and it's like I
[03:31] really L we could you could look at I
[03:34] was very often was very often about you
[03:36] know the daily discussion like you go
[03:39] ahead and talk about it there and then
[03:40] it's like on top of it we
[03:43] um we had you know like this her
[03:47] emergence of like rbtc like kind of
[03:51] taking over and E crying our buttcoin
[03:54] kind of being the whole you know little
[03:56] adversary kind of uh trying to be like
[03:59] reason Contra argument and a lot of
[04:02] people were reason with their Contra
[04:03] arguments and I was agree with that you
[04:05] know and um that was fine and that that
[04:08] was awesome that was great discourse you
[04:10] know um because I really feel like the
[04:13] girl is me to have the average
[04:17] intelligence and the average uh you know
[04:20] information of what was happening with
[04:23] relasing the block size or with kind of
[04:25] the approaches of scalability like to
[04:28] the ref friend if the average you know
[04:30] information about it was you know more
[04:32] improved than we could be able to carry
[04:35] forward like other proposed Solutions
[04:38] like ultimately um that you know we were
[04:41] thinking about for scalability um
[04:45] but but's kind of give a little bit of
[04:47] background to that like I'll just kind
[04:48] of give you like my what I remembered
[04:51] about it right so what I recall was uh
[04:54] Gavin and dreon talking about and this
[04:57] believe this would have been about 2014
[05:00] because we were already kind of going
[05:01] through the bur you know bur Market of
[05:03] 13 and then kind of ruling back down it
[05:05] was kind of like hey guys like you guys
[05:08] should noce like we do need to increase
[05:10] block size otherwise we're going to run
[05:11] into problems with uh having scalability
[05:15] and trying to compete with visa and so I
[05:18] propose was Bitcoin XT which was just
[05:20] like a modest two megabyte you know
[05:22] block size increase and when that
[05:25] happened I mean I remember a lot of
[05:26] people kind of being up and arms about
[05:27] and other people like I said like being
[05:30] G hord and going forward and promoting
[05:32] it I feel like Roger ver was kind of in
[05:34] that c and kind of with them and this
[05:37] was also bolstered by uh by Mike Hearn
[05:39] as well and so you had these big
[05:41] prominent like people in vicoy who were
[05:43] you know like deified at that point
[05:45] because there were the Bringers of the
[05:48] software like Gavin andreon was the the
[05:50] the lead scientist and maintainer of the
[05:52] Bitcoin you know reference client at the
[05:55] time and then you had Mike her who was
[05:58] on who was the the guy behind coin J
[06:00] Bitcoin Java and that's pretty much
[06:02] where was used for all the SPV rollets
[06:05] which you know at that point in 2013 you
[06:07] were using one of his derivative wallets
[06:09] if it wasn't one of his wallets and it
[06:11] was one of Andreas shbox wallets which
[06:13] was the classic Bitcoin wallet and uh
[06:16] even n was still using Bitcoin J and so
[06:19] like these were big people let me think
[06:21] about it right um like they did have
[06:25] like experience um and were were
[06:29] considered like more respect like I
[06:31] would say even more so than like luk and
[06:34] CK right um who were doing like the
[06:37] mining software that everybody was using
[06:39] it's kind of wild let me think about it
[06:40] right uh
[06:42] so happened and then I recall from there
[06:46] kind of uh my career not really kind of
[06:48] getting his word XT like like people
[06:50] were kind of not really going with it
[06:53] and so like uh he sort of did the roach
[06:56] PR thing and then I remembered uh
[07:00] the reason why Gavin andreon kind of
[07:03] phased out was because he got puried by
[07:06] Craig Wright right like uh and so that
[07:09] that happened
[07:10] there so anyhow those things happened
[07:13] and then um it kind of mfed from being a
[07:18] narrative about Bitcoin uh XT and being
[07:21] about uh Bitcoin cash and the difference
[07:24] with and Bitcoin cash was Roger Bear's
[07:26] thing right and so that was 2016
[07:29] I think and so uh or it might have been
[07:31] in the end of yeah I think it would have
[07:33] been 2016 kind of 2017 because the whole
[07:36] little split happened and there was like
[07:38] a quick run up when that split happened
[07:40] and it wasn't really a split so much as
[07:42] it was an
[07:43] airdrop um okay we are coming back yeah
[07:47] it wasn't so much SPL as it was an air
[07:49] drop and so when that happened um
[07:52] ultimately yeah like the the word kind
[07:54] of went nuts with it and was like some
[07:56] people cashed out and some people were
[07:58] like this is going to be the next
[07:59] Bitcoin
[08:00] and so
[08:01] um that happened and it kind of gained a
[08:04] bit of traction but then it fizzled out
[08:05] um where everybody fizzled up but it was
[08:07] get traction but at the same time you
[08:09] had uh I believe it was if it was it
[08:12] Gian Ru it where the yeah I think it was
[08:16] Gan was promoting bcoin ABC right which
[08:20] um was yeah fork and this was kind I
[08:24] believe OBC was uh from the perspective
[08:26] that you know we would have put control
[08:28] for the miners because the are the ones
[08:30] behind validating and pushing
[08:32] transactions forward um and you know
[08:34] obviously the thing is that Bitcoin this
[08:39] Bitcoin is kind of it's as much a
[08:41] technology as it's a social experiment
[08:42] right because it's a social experiment
[08:44] and seeing how Game Theory will play out
[08:46] if humans will actually follow Game
[08:48] Theory or not um because what happened
[08:50] was you have all these different
[08:51] participants a lot of them have skin in
[08:53] the game a lot of them don't um you'd
[08:55] have skin in the game by having a bunch
[08:57] of coins help um or by working on
[09:00] development of the protocol or working
[09:01] on development of derivative software
[09:03] that follows the protocol right and so
[09:05] all these people that's how I used
[09:07] feeline M her felt like yeah like what
[09:09] he had to say was important like he had
[09:11] the skin in the game to be able to say
[09:13] yeah this is my reputation what I
[09:14] brought to the table same with you know
[09:17] uh Gavin and dreon and then if you want
[09:19] to go further we can even talk about
[09:21] like Luke Dash Jr or we could talk about
[09:23] um the guy from uh uh Brit per uh I'm
[09:29] going remember later basically these
[09:30] folks all came up with like derivative
[09:33] ways of using a reference protocol and
[09:36] the thing is now this stuff really kind
[09:37] of gains traction because there the the
[09:41] issue is that at the end of the day
[09:43] people do something because there's an
[09:44] incentive to do it and bitcoiners aren't
[09:48] stupid bitcoiners fine what is the
[09:50] hidden incentive for doing what you're
[09:52] doing and once you that's found out you
[09:54] see that it's not it's not from a place
[09:56] of it's not a genuine place like it's
[09:58] not actually with those try to improve
[10:00] things as a place to improve your hand
[10:03] or improve your standing into game um in
[10:08] since that's why people don't like um
[10:11] that's why a lot of people don't like
[10:12] Adam back and Greg Maxwell right because
[10:15] block stream and and the fact that they
[10:18] utilizing and used tether to you know be
[10:20] able to um be able to you know with this
[10:26] trust have a different like firm money
[10:29] that's not blocked by sanctions or by
[10:32] Visa
[10:34] right and so um and it's well as as
[10:38] right that kind of leads to this whole
[10:40] idea of like Justin some I think his
[10:43] name with Tron right K backing is a
[10:45] competitor for that but and in our sense
[10:48] it's like these things kind of give
[10:50] creat and validity to all coins which is
[10:51] kind of like it's gross if you're try to
[10:54] be a maximalist or if you've gone
[10:57] through this evolution of discovering
[10:59] Bitcoin discovering altcoins trying
[11:01] altcoins getting burned on altcoins and
[11:02] just trying to be a purist and staying
[11:04] into Bitcoin because you just see that
[11:07] Bitcoin is a tool to opt out right and
[11:10] so if that happens and ideally that path
[11:13] you go through you really have this
[11:16] incentive to not want to see Bitcoin
[11:17] change and not want to see stupids
[11:19] happen to destroy what we have and so
[11:22] because of that that's how you explain
[11:23] how people with a lot of skin in the
[11:25] game versus people with no skin in the
[11:26] game who are just kind of maybe have you
[11:30] know 80 or 90 million tury right maybe
[11:33] that's all I got but to them that's for
[11:35] life savings right uh that's how explain
[11:38] why these different diverse perspectives
[11:40] happen and because these diverse
[11:41] perspectives you're going to have the
[11:43] Waring and infighting and it's going to
[11:46] be slow to devolve to evolve and slow to
[11:48] change and I think that is the correct
[11:50] path because uh the slow to evolve and
[11:52] to change will ensure that you will have
[11:55] resiliency until a point is necessary to
[11:58] where things are broken and if things
[12:00] are broken mean you will fix or you will
[12:01] have already had the time to plan those
[12:03] Solutions or the solutions have already
[12:05] occurred and you can just have a drop
[12:07] and fit kind of with the substitutes I
[12:09] mean in way you could kind of see that's
[12:10] what happened with our decision with
[12:12] Luke Dash Jr and I believe it was
[12:15] uh I forget the guy's name I think it's
[12:18] Peter D uh's decision to kind of soft
[12:21] Fork segwit right and so um yeah like
[12:25] that was kind of what happened and men
[12:27] in 2017 is exciting time because
[12:29] ultimately that yeah that's kind of also
[12:32] when the users felt like they could put
[12:33] it in their hands and um you know do
[12:36] their user activated softwork right the
[12:38] uasf right and so um yeah that was kind
[12:42] of the all right guys we need to see
[12:43] this happen because if that doesn't
[12:45] happen you know shit's goingon to go bad
[12:47] we don't care we're gonna Fork the
[12:48] network we're gon to make it happen
[12:50] right and I I see kind of like that was
[12:52] sort of
[12:53] the I you know that was different it was
[12:56] just other persons like decided and you
[12:59] know desire for RO to have an outcome by
[13:02] trying to force the outcome and I think
[13:04] they got lucky that you know there was
[13:06] just enough a notion of that nobody
[13:08] really kind of cared because in essence
[13:10] like that could have been a bad moment
[13:12] to where we would have had like a
[13:13] Bitcoin versus a Bitcoin classic you
[13:16] know um so that's kind of how I see that
[13:22] that pass in that history um like I said
[13:25] around 2015 it really fed and 2016 it
[13:29] felt a little stressful because it kind
[13:31] of felt like an US versus like us
[13:33] moderators versus everybody who was just
[13:35] kind of like we're about through them
[13:37] and we try to be maximalist and so we
[13:39] should discuss and we don't care if you
[13:41] know this is what you have to say right
[13:43] and it's like but you're being full
[13:46] hearty about it and you know this is I'm
[13:48] sure TR and sure how the society full
[13:50] hearty about it and it seemed like yeah
[13:52] about 2017 with kind of the USF like
[13:56] everybody kind of saw yeah we can't just
[13:57] do biger blocks like because this a
[14:00] shock at of apprach and trying to kind
[14:02] of go for the quick and easy dur
[14:03] solution you're going to have the
[14:05] situation where you're going to need to
[14:06] have class prohibitive Hardware like
[14:09] over time as you're trying to have the
[14:11] same sort of transaction reliability if
[14:13] you're doing the bigger blocks do you
[14:15] feel that the discourse and the
[14:18] discussions now are more mature like in
[14:22] in a in a different state I mean uh
[14:25] since 20145 Bitcoin has evolved a lot
[14:28] like we have now
[14:29] uh public companies in there we have the
[14:31] Bitcoin ETF like we have a lot of um
[14:34] more Capital more people in there more
[14:37] institutional investors uh probably I
[14:39] was not around 2015 I was coming into a
[14:43] community slowly in 2017 but really in
[14:45] 2020 uh I imagine that this cause and
[14:49] the community was really really
[14:51] different how did this Evol over what
[14:53] time like how how different was it 2015
[14:55] to compared to
[14:56] now yeah I mean it's 2015 people still
[15:00] thought you know that it's still a risk
[15:03] it's still highly experimental like
[15:04] there's we don't know that it's going to
[15:06] be here to stay um like it felt like
[15:09] that in 2013 when I just got started but
[15:11] uh like for
[15:13] me yeah like but at the same time
[15:17] um well had the steing where was like
[15:19] you know the Bitcoin Bitcoin cleared
[15:21] th000 bucks it was 1,200 bucks in
[15:22] November of 2013 and so we were just
[15:24] like yeah this is it this is the feature
[15:27] I remember like that happening in six
[15:29] months before just getting into bco
[15:31] thinking man I wish it would reach
[15:33] $10,000 one day that would be so
[15:35] incredible you know like that's where
[15:37] was at um and uh yeah like it just kind
[15:40] of bu
[15:41] this because that happened like I was
[15:44] like wow this is going to be it was like
[15:45] life changing forever like you the it
[15:48] happened in December 2013 I booked
[15:51] tickets to go to Miami to the conference
[15:53] in in January right because I was like
[15:54] it's it we're we're done and then I quit
[15:56] my job and I tried to you know try
[16:00] that was I tried to show it in mind full
[16:01] time and that didn't work right so uh
[16:04] yeah like it was a different time so
[16:05] around 200 15 2016 it was a little hairy
[16:10] because you were her block size kind of
[16:12] thing and then I think that's the scale
[16:15] Bitcoin conference happened in December
[16:17] 2015 and Peter and uh Luke Drew W
[16:21] announced the little soft for thing like
[16:24] it was like epic mic drop we were all
[16:26] like wow this is the [ __ ] like everybody
[16:28] was in un and yeah that's that's a
[16:29] solution that's a great way because um
[16:32] with the soft work you are able to S
[16:35] like keep your s for and it still runs
[16:38] and then the newer software just kind of
[16:40] Ops in and the whole point is um you
[16:43] game threeory it should be incentivized
[16:46] for you to where you are going to be
[16:48] able to you know like um want to switch
[16:51] over because it'll be cheaper fees or
[16:52] you get better transaction transaction
[16:55] throw but something interesting too that
[16:57] I kind of think about um
[16:59] that around that time like 2015 2016
[17:03] lightning was uh was definitely like uh
[17:06] um an experiment like a much like much
[17:09] more an experiment I remember uh like
[17:11] rose beef and Rusty Russell kind of did
[17:14] their stuff that um I believe roast beef
[17:17] uh did
[17:18] the um you know an clar implementation
[17:21] right and then uh or I might be wrong
[17:24] but pretty much yeah like it was just
[17:26] kind of experimental software and it was
[17:29] kind of not clear how it worked um but
[17:32] it was interesting you know and um kind
[17:34] of now we've hit this point to where it
[17:38] robbed but it stagnated and um we tried
[17:42] to have like lur bears for everybody
[17:44] kind of 's lightning but I see that like
[17:47] the geopolitical environment has like
[17:49] made it hostile to even like touch um
[17:52] and that's why you have like on boarders
[17:55] who were there to try to make the
[17:57] experience easier they're kind of like
[17:58] taking flight because like to them they
[18:01] don't see the the worth the worth itness
[18:03] for the regulatory race to have to try
[18:05] to hold Reserve try to have
[18:06] accountability for kyc AML when the
[18:09] whole point is that you're not supposed
[18:10] to am AML kyc these things you should
[18:13] just spin as you see
[18:16] F I love it and it's it's it's
[18:20] fascinating for me how this this space
[18:22] evolved like when you compare it like
[18:24] how how hard it was at some point to buy
[18:26] even Bitcoin uh and now it gets easy and
[18:29] easier to buy it gets easy and easier to
[18:31] spend it it it would be interesting to
[18:33] see where we are in like 10 years with
[18:35] more money coming in more companies
[18:36] coming in more interests coming in and
[18:38] more technology advancement in the
[18:40] ecosystem around
[18:42] Bitcoin course I want to I want to
[18:45] counter kind of what you're saying like
[18:46] um so I would say it yeah you're right
[18:49] it has been kind of like it was hard to
[18:52] acquire Bitcoin but it was like but it's
[18:54] weird like it was hard to acquire bin
[18:56] before I got in uh when I got in it was
[18:59] actually kind of
[19:00] easy like Lun know March 2013 it was
[19:03] kind of easy um let say conversely you
[19:06] could actually SP b a lot more places in
[19:09] the past versus now it seems like it's
[19:11] much harder really like you would think
[19:13] you should be it's ubiquitous but it
[19:16] seems less ubiquitous like really
[19:18] Renaissance was 2013 when you had
[19:21] Microsoft and Overstock and Expedia
[19:23] doing their thing right like uh exped
[19:27] was doing their thing but I found
[19:29] something called cheap air and that's
[19:30] how I bought plane tickets for Bitcoin I
[19:33] that seemed awesome to me and then you
[19:35] had Vin Langan who had this uh he had
[19:37] this like gift card I forget what it's
[19:39] called but uh he had like a gift card
[19:41] kind of exchange thing where you could
[19:42] buy the digital gift cards for the
[19:44] Bitcoin and like I was using that to Li
[19:46] off Bitcoin in 2014 for a bit right and
[19:48] so um a lot of those things are gone um
[19:52] like I bought at Xbox for 3qu quers of a
[19:55] Bitcoin right because it was such a
[19:56] sweet deal it was like 180 bucks the
[19:58] time and had like you know a whole year
[20:01] of like Xbox live and stuff right but to
[20:05] me like that I valued that because I led
[20:07] video games and like my income is only
[20:09] Bitcoin so it worked for me H but that's
[20:12] gone I don't think you can buy things on
[20:15] New Egg anymore with pcoin right um
[20:20] that's really interesting and uh it
[20:23] might be because it was a new thing and
[20:25] people were testing it out and then like
[20:27] oh okay Bitcoin is not ready for to
[20:29] being a a medum of exchange yet and I I
[20:32] feel like it is not really ready for
[20:34] mass mass adoption like I think like the
[20:37] question of like oh when the field
[20:38] system actually fails like in two years
[20:41] and Bitcoin should actually replace it
[20:42] in two years I feel like we we're not
[20:44] there yet like it needs a little we need
[20:47] definitely more time Duda do you
[20:50] agree uh yeah but the thing is like I
[20:54] know I've grown and like since you know
[20:57] 200 13 and for I don't think the Fiat
[21:01] system fails like you know like we're
[21:03] saying like it's not a fantastic or
[21:04] spectacular thing it's it like a slow
[21:07] kind of Max pain thing where everybody
[21:08] does exactly what they can to try to
[21:10] keep things going as long as they can
[21:11] because there's still a lot of people
[21:12] that are succeeding and thriving through
[21:14] the Fiat system and through the
[21:16] inefficiencies it ranks and so those
[21:18] people were will die for you know
[21:21] keeping that system the way it is
[21:22] because that was their nut you know
[21:23] that's how they made what they had um
[21:26] and so you there's going to I think
[21:29] there's going to the the Situation's
[21:31] going to be kind of a a terror of two
[21:34] systems where the two systems will
[21:36] continue to thrive and there's going to
[21:37] be a point to where hopefully critical
[21:41] mass happens and more and more people
[21:43] kind of do this uh I think it's called
[21:44] quad fur you know maneuver where more
[21:46] and more of the the value from the one
[21:48] chain go which is you know the classical
[21:51] assets and equities goes into just
[21:53] holding Bitcoin and Bitcoin derivatives
[21:56] I think the problem with uh
[21:59] this though is that Bitcoin is
[22:00] ultimately seen as a storage of value
[22:03] and it's not necessarily seen as a
[22:06] method as a method and mechanisms of
[22:07] transacting it's not seen as caching and
[22:10] that's kind of I think what Roger ver is
[22:12] this whole like you know argument is
[22:14] based on his going through it and why he
[22:17] believes that Bitcoin cash is the
[22:19] Bitcoin and is that it's the the digital
[22:22] cash however I have another theory I
[22:24] think that sat Shaka murderer opted out
[22:27] and left Bitcoin because he saw that
[22:29] human beings were inherently you know
[22:31] flawed and that this technology is also
[22:35] a social experiment and that we fa right
[22:39] because we're caught in the minutia of
[22:43] how can I bring my own position forward
[22:44] rather than how can we all survive
[22:47] together and Thrive um I I can see that
[22:50] that that's kind of the way will happen
[22:53] though because what I've said how can
[22:55] how can we all work together and Thrive
[22:58] fun Lieutenant of Communism right like
[23:01] and socialism and the thing is the
[23:04] problem with Communism and
[23:05] socialism that I think the word needs to
[23:08] understand is that on paper it's great
[23:11] but the reason why it doesn't work is
[23:12] because you're always going to have the
[23:14] ageny problem you're always got have
[23:15] people at the top or people that have
[23:18] Insider information or privileged
[23:19] information they're going to use it to
[23:21] exploit everyone else and so everyone
[23:23] else in aggregate loses because you have
[23:25] cheaters and that's that's human nature
[23:29] and so that right there like
[23:32] is i that's that you know so
[23:36] um how do you how do you grow Move Along
[23:39] beyond that right that's why I said it
[23:40] was like it's kind of like a human
[23:42] behavior and human you know F problem
[23:45] not necessarily and that because of that
[23:47] like no technology can solve that like
[23:50] no AI is going to solve that no cash or
[23:52] no law no votes gonna solve that I think
[23:55] the AR thing that solves things like
[23:56] that is Max pay like people throwing
[23:59] great suffering and feeling like they
[24:01] need to collectively come together and
[24:02] that's the reason I have like
[24:04] independent state movies and like
[24:06] Armageddon movies and like disease and a
[24:09] movies that's the reason why people Rock
[24:10] behind it because it's so like wildly
[24:13] like you know so Fury to likee but it
[24:16] seems like yeah I would band a together
[24:18] with my enemy to you know to be able to
[24:21] survive right and so that's what humans
[24:24] want right we want to be able to stir
[24:25] like rest seeding and flourishing but
[24:28] it's like funny
[24:30] because we make up enemies and we make
[24:33] up bad guys but the reality we all bad
[24:36] guys like everybody is the actual bad
[24:38] guy and the real he is no good guy
[24:40] because we're based on this whole like
[24:42] selfish interest
[24:44] thing that's that's an fascinating
[24:47] thought uh to think about um what you
[24:50] said earlier about communis I'm I'm 100%
[24:52] agreeing with you like this is uh
[24:54] totally the case and I hope so that we
[24:57] come to the state where where we all
[24:59] kind of agree that we cannot all Thrive
[25:02] like that there there will be people
[25:04] that thrive more and that will be people
[25:06] that thrive less just because of like
[25:09] even if you uh level out the capital for
[25:14] every human but every human has a human
[25:17] capital like how he thinks what he does
[25:20] like what what his brain is all about
[25:22] and you can uh and I'm a deeply a
[25:25] believer that someone that was poor from
[25:28] from poor family and got rich because he
[25:30] worked hard and he was disciplined you
[25:32] can take all his money and he will work
[25:35] his uh butt off and will be like five 10
[25:37] years at the same point than he was
[25:39] before because he knows how to uh get it
[25:42] and if you take a poor person uh and
[25:45] give them a bunch of money they will
[25:47] lose it again uh this is the the same
[25:50] thing that happens with all the lottery
[25:52] winners like we have great studies about
[25:54] the lottery winners when they win it
[25:56] they give the money out and they
[25:58] probably have in one two years less than
[26:00] before they spend it all yeah and and so
[26:04] it's like even if we level out the
[26:06] capital there's still the human brain
[26:08] involved and so for me Bitcoin is just a
[26:12] more fair system where when you have
[26:16] Bitcoin as a fundamental base layer of
[26:18] of our monetary system uh you can you
[26:21] have the chance to save in something
[26:23] sound and so you can focus on what
[26:26] you're good at but if if you're not
[26:28] doing anything like it's like I make the
[26:30] the comparison between if if you running
[26:33] on a field system you're running in like
[26:35] a sand where there's a lot of water you
[26:38] have to dread a lot you have to really
[26:40] work hard to get ahead and in in in in
[26:44] in Bitcoin it's just like a foundation
[26:45] where you can run on a solid Street you
[26:48] still have to run like if you don't run
[26:49] on bitcoin like you also don't get
[26:51] anything like Bitcoin is proof of work
[26:53] you have to put in something to get
[26:55] something out and this is the
[26:56] fundamental thing and I and I hope that
[26:58] Bitcoin enables a world where um people
[27:01] that work hard are rewarded the most and
[27:04] and and not the rent Seekers as we have
[27:06] it now in the in the feat
[27:08] system yeah absolutely I totally agree
[27:11] with that
[27:13] um but how could I mean how could that
[27:16] happen though like I said because it's
[27:17] still based on a like human desire to
[27:20] want to be Equitable or human desire to
[27:22] want to spend your Bitcoin to like see
[27:23] you know some sort of growth or see that
[27:25] there's actual gain or benefit from
[27:27] doing that versus taking out a loan and
[27:29] using the loan to you know get your your
[27:31] thing going right
[27:34] um and so yeah I I think because of that
[27:37] like It ultimately kind of fails but
[27:40] then like having running cash so want a
[27:43] cash system like for everybody across
[27:45] the world does actually it doesn't fit
[27:47] for those like like I mean America right
[27:49] it doesn't fit for because right now
[27:52] like my country is like my country is
[27:53] loading expor is inflation right it's
[27:55] because everybody else in the world uses
[27:57] my currency and so you were going to go
[27:59] edies my thinging I don't have an
[28:01] incentive to switch to something better
[28:03] or different like like um I would
[28:05] imagine fundamentally something from
[28:07] Sweden or Switzerland or Iceland would
[28:10] be like a considered a stronger currency
[28:12] based on the fundamentals and the fact
[28:13] that there's not things like you know
[28:15] there's not people or firstes that throw
[28:17] that are trying to prob more of it or
[28:18] utilize more of it to you
[28:21] know to whatever
[28:23] end but at the same time uh excuse me I
[28:28] was uh I was talking to like loved one
[28:30] earlier and um it was that like that you
[28:35] can't you can't like look at these
[28:37] different places in different countries
[28:39] like uh like oh it's better and the
[28:42] reason why is because everybody is
[28:43] unique like every different situation is
[28:45] unique um like things may be great in it
[28:48] in Switzerland but they don't have to
[28:50] worry about the scalability issues and
[28:52] they the PO the level of people in
[28:55] poverty and in in who are not educ and
[28:58] level of people Harless that maybe
[29:00] Americans do and America has and they
[29:01] don't maybe have the same number of
[29:03] cities or different government St have
[29:04] to deal with like that America has and
[29:06] so because of those things it's like the
[29:08] different countries Nations they have
[29:09] their own kind of unique distinctive
[29:11] problems they can we can kind of try to
[29:13] compare but it's like apples to oranges
[29:15] in a way because there's also different
[29:17] uh accepted cultural norms and like like
[29:20] I tell you right now like if you were
[29:22] trying to be a midle management in Japan
[29:25] and you been in America your whole life
[29:27] you better be working your off and
[29:28] actually like try to work 10 times
[29:30] harder than you did in America because
[29:31] you're not going to milk it in Japan
[29:33] right it's just like there's like a
[29:35] cultural separation right and so like
[29:37] yeah that that is something I think that
[29:40] uh I think that's beautiful and great
[29:42] and I think that uh trying to kind of
[29:44] homogenize that like is is a mistake and
[29:46] so when you think about it like saying
[29:48] that Bitcoin will be the reserved
[29:50] currency will take over and be the
[29:51] standard does that and so that's why I S
[29:54] again like it's going to be a situation
[29:56] where Bitcoin is just going to curve
[29:57] this with the other things I don't think
[29:59] it's a situation where gold dies off or
[30:01] where like currency dies off like so
[30:03] suddenly for that to happen you have to
[30:05] have other geopolitical uh stressors in
[30:08] play like Wars and like nuclear Wars and
[30:11] like the inability to be able to
[30:14] transact it kind of regular way and once
[30:16] I think about it that point it's not
[30:18] Bitcoin anymore man I me I I'll be real
[30:20] it's not Bitcoin it's water and it's
[30:22] medicine and it's food and so you're not
[30:25] going til the time to I need to keep the
[30:27] power so I can keep my nerve going so I
[30:28] can have my P syn so I can go over the
[30:30] radio tower and we can mess own and then
[30:32] I trans [ __ ] that you're going to be
[30:34] spinning bir and burls and tampons and
[30:37] maybe some herbs right maybe some
[30:38] cannabis I
[30:40] mean like let's let's be pragmatic here
[30:43] and so um like Bitcoin is a solution
[30:48] that only works so long as the other
[30:50] systems remain inefficient and continue
[30:53] to succeed if you are listening to this
[30:55] podcast you might be wondering what is
[30:58] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[31:00] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[31:03] there's two things you have to buy
[31:04] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[31:06] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[31:08] let's focus on the first thing how to
[31:10] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[31:13] only exchange don't deal with the
[31:15] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[31:16] exchange that has an own token or
[31:18] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[31:21] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[31:24] for me the best partner for that and now
[31:28] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[31:29] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[31:31] a self custody solution where you
[31:35] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[31:37] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[31:41] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[31:43] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[31:46] phas and you are better than 95% of all
[31:50] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[31:52] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[31:55] have one last thing before we get back
[31:57] to the video I'm really passionate about
[31:59] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[32:02] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[32:05] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[32:08] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[32:11] conference in whole of Europe for all
[32:13] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[32:15] this place in June for all europees it's
[32:18] a must go anyways you are so close to
[32:21] the Bitcoin PR conference you basically
[32:23] have to come I will do interviews there
[32:25] and I would love to meet you all there
[32:28] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[32:31] get discounts and use the links down in
[32:33] the description but before we get to
[32:35] some other topics that I really want to
[32:37] get into like YouTube 3D printer and
[32:39] stuff like that um what is
[32:41] like the most exciting or and the most
[32:45] unexciting part of of of Bitcoin for you
[32:48] like what is uh the the thing that
[32:50] you're really excited about inside of
[32:52] Bitcoin because it's always interesting
[32:53] to because I speak with so many
[32:55] different bitcoiners uh and bitco coers
[32:58] have so many different reasons why they
[32:59] in
[33:00] Bitcoin yeah so like what's the most
[33:03] exciting part for you and like what's
[33:04] the most uninteresting point in in
[33:07] Bitcoin most an interesting thing in
[33:09] Bitcoin is the
[33:11] price absolutely the price [ __ ] the
[33:13] price if you're looking at the price of
[33:15] Bitcoin you're a short Bitcoin it's what
[33:17] it is like you just need to you see it
[33:21] you understand that it is a mechanism
[33:22] for opting out uh the the current Fiat
[33:25] system and so you are you are voting by
[33:27] opting out that's it and that is it you
[33:30] will then continue to increase your
[33:32] position you will SP the Bitcoin when
[33:34] you find something that will make you
[33:36] truly happy from spending it like if you
[33:38] feel like putting a greater portion of a
[33:40] down payment on a house is the way that
[33:42] is how you will spend the Bitcoin you
[33:44] won care when there's A10 million doll
[33:45] house one day because it doesn't matter
[33:47] it makes you happy [ __ ] them like you
[33:50] you thrive from telling them how much
[33:51] Bitcoin you spent on it like I I love my
[33:54] I love my Xbox one I don't even play it
[33:56] anymore I spent three4 of a Bitcoin on
[33:57] it but I'm give a [ __ ] like it was great
[34:00] you know like I played Fallout 4 on it
[34:03] like a couple months in when I had no
[34:05] job and it was so I was told it was so
[34:07] irresponsible to do it we didn't care
[34:09] like I I cherished every moment playing
[34:12] that game you know what I'm saying like
[34:13] I I [ __ ] loved it and it was it was a
[34:15] wonderful time experience uh so yeah
[34:18] price is the most unimportant thing the
[34:20] most unting most interesting thing is um
[34:23] the children the kids I I I'm I'm so I I
[34:30] love this narrative I I love I love that
[34:33] Luca is here that Becca had LCA you know
[34:35] I love that uh you know the from uh the
[34:39] moon Factory right uh Bitcoin Becca she
[34:42] just like had a baby um I love that you
[34:45] know all Bill coiners are like having
[34:46] having children and that we're having
[34:49] you know we're working hard that's the
[34:51] proof of work trying to have children to
[34:53] be able to you know spread and have them
[34:56] grow and the the beauty of Bitcoin is
[34:58] Bitcoin is like the Dumbo feather right
[35:00] like you realize you don't uh parman
[35:03] said something a couple of days ago I
[35:05] you know Ro on Twitter the parman yeah
[35:08] he said think come about sort of you
[35:09] know resonate with he said yeah like
[35:11] it's like a dumbo feather you know you R
[35:13] you don't they didn't say Dum he's like
[35:14] you don't really need Bitcoin like R you
[35:17] realize where it is you don't need it
[35:18] it's like yeah that's totally right you
[35:21] don't need Bitcoin Bitcoin comes to you
[35:23] because you put in proof of work Bitcoin
[35:25] shows you that you need to be resilient
[35:28] in your you know what you want to do and
[35:31] work on and work towards you know maybe
[35:33] it's just drawing maybe it's just
[35:35] writing your story but actually putting
[35:37] the desire and commitment to making it
[35:39] happen like pouring a love into it um
[35:42] pouring that love in work in it just
[35:44] gets reflected out and people eat that
[35:46] up because that's what they want because
[35:48] they can Thrive from just being able to
[35:51] experience like what you have you know
[35:53] like I get compliments all the time
[35:55] about kind of the content that I do and
[35:57] I want like I don't know I just speaking
[35:59] my mind like you were saying you record
[36:01] this I tell you like conversely I do
[36:03] shorts and live all the time I um I
[36:05] found that I I don't really care for
[36:07] video editing I don't care but it's just
[36:10] like a kind of a brog like I know
[36:12] there's going to be circumstances like I
[36:13] said have a 4k camera there's G be
[36:15] circumstances where I'm still going to
[36:16] do it but yeah like
[36:18] um yeah like I seen kind of the
[36:21] perspectives in the future of the
[36:23] children that we're making and um I
[36:26] believe that that love will continue to
[36:28] carry out and we will have someone
[36:31] someday that will build something that
[36:33] will Bridge the divides together and I
[36:35] think maybe that's kind of what we would
[36:37] like to see we would like to see really
[36:39] coin become a great equalizer towards
[36:42] access and opportunity access to
[36:44] Opportunities right like that maybe more
[36:47] people can be employed somehow through
[36:49] Bitcoin or you know we can have things
[36:51] done in such a way to where you know you
[36:54] um you have a better access to like like
[36:58] healthcare or better access to
[36:59] technology because of the proximity to
[37:02] bitcoin because Bitcoin Powers all these
[37:03] things and just by being aware of it you
[37:06] can do bridges that people who don't
[37:09] care about Bitcoin or have no desire to
[37:10] use Bitcoin have desire to use this
[37:12] product which is powered by Bitcoin
[37:14] right um and that that is what will
[37:17] happen as long as we continue to you
[37:20] know durb love into the children that we
[37:22] make and teach them about the importance
[37:26] of work and the proof of work and to
[37:28] only spend the Bitcoin on situations
[37:31] circumstances that make them truly
[37:33] happy that's I thing the most beautiful
[37:36] answer to to that question that someone
[37:38] can up can come up with really really

[41:20] cool and congratulations on the first
[41:22] 500 I and I know how how hard of a
[41:25] struggle it is like I I the first time I
[41:29] tried YouTube it was like three years
[41:32] ago I really struggled hard and got from
[41:35] Zer to 200 in like a year something like
[41:39] that I was really bad also uh then I
[41:41] tried again now in December uh I got one
[41:45] month and got like five subscribers more
[41:47] like 2005 or something like that in in
[41:50] January and then I kind of figured it
[41:53] out how it's working and I'm now really
[41:55] close to the 4,000 subscribers uh
[41:59] like that was like really all of the
[42:02] sudden when you you figure out how how
[42:04] it's working and and people like his
[42:05] stuff and people recommend to other
[42:07] people's uh stuff and the the most
[42:09] amazing thing for me is always when
[42:11] someone goes ahead and clips one of my
[42:14] Clips one of my videos and puts it on
[42:17] Twitter with my original Link in there
[42:19] and tags me I'm like
[42:23] what people go through the struggle
[42:26] through the struggle and clip it and and
[42:27] I always repost and and advertise for
[42:30] them the [ __ ] out because I I really
[42:32] appreciate that work and I appreciate
[42:34] that you got so much uh Val how to do
[42:36] that so I'm I'm I'm bumped it I'm I'm
[42:39] already here but uh I I know how hard it
[42:43] is to go anywhere on on on YouTube
[42:46] YouTube is a really hard platform to
[42:48] grow honestly Twitter I feel like was
[42:50] easier it's a little bit more viral you
[42:52] can connect easier but YouTube at least
[42:55] for me it was the hardest platform from
[42:57] honestly till
[42:59] now and yeah really really cool that uh
[43:02] that you are here and and encourage
[43:04] everybody to to check your stuff out and
[43:06] and I'm looking forward to to to seeing
[43:08] more of you and seeing live streams of
[43:10] you really cool and you're doing 3D
[43:13] printing uh what what what are you doing
[43:16] there uh a lot uh you know I'll be right
[43:21] back I'll show you
[43:22] something all right I'm back so here we
[43:26] go this is a this is an Excalibur Sonic
[43:30] that I've uh pred recently it's it's
[43:33] like color nice yeah um I it's golden
[43:39] right it's a golden color yeah it's a
[43:42] yeah it's it's kind of like the Inc in
[43:44] Super Sonic right uh from Sonic in the
[43:47] Black Knight it's a game that came out
[43:48] on Wii I think U mid 2010 or something
[43:52] like that yeah but uh yeah I printed
[43:55] this kind of in one go
[43:57] on a um bamboo Labs
[44:00] x1c I printed it upside down to try to
[44:03] kind of have the the Boke of the Mask
[44:05] kind of this way and then I just had a
[44:06] bunch of sports and then yeah like it's
[44:08] it's multicolored um it was done with a
[44:11] matter and so you kind of see right here
[44:13] I had to kind of fix his belt with some
[44:15] glue because uh this wasn't done like
[44:17] with an STL model this was done with
[44:19] like ther model so there's a bunch of
[44:21] THS and gaps in here like cuz that's
[44:24] what he would they probably they ripped
[44:25] this directly from like video game
[44:27] assets and so uh you know that's kind of
[44:30] uh what that was but this is kind of the
[44:33] last thing my PR was pretty proud of uh
[44:35] we said we should talk about that uh so
[44:37] what happened was in
[44:39] 2012 I um I was a workaholic and I
[44:43] wasn't taking care of my elf and I got
[44:46] inection and I got um septicity I got
[44:50] sepsis right and so I was in the
[44:51] hospital for like two weeks right like
[44:54] half a month and I had like surgeries
[44:56] like every day like you know basically
[44:58] you know K off like basically just you
[45:01] know the bad flesh right like pretty
[45:03] much have surgeries to like Rec and so
[45:06] um yeah like I was getting a prognosis
[45:09] for like 20% like like yeah was 80%
[45:12] chance you're gonna die dude and so you
[45:15] know you know be alive after I I thank
[45:19] forens your eyes to you don't want to be
[45:21] a work of arcing man after that you
[45:23] really want to live your life and love
[45:25] you for you so they have every more that
[45:28] you can have right so yeah don't be
[45:29] workaholic just just from that if if I
[45:32] if I can teach you to not be workaholic
[45:34] from that my my mission has been
[45:36] accomplished as a person in life and I'm
[45:38] I'm Happ I'm satisfied from just that
[45:42] and one thing I want to add to that like
[45:45] there's this concept of Ika you probably
[45:47] heard of
[45:49] it there's like half Ika and full Ika
[45:52] and and there's like this full Concept
[45:55] in inside of Ika there's the thing do
[45:58] what you love do what you're good at uh
[46:01] do what the world needs and do what you
[46:04] will get rewarded for and uh the first
[46:07] two things are really important to find
[46:09] the second two things like if you find
[46:11] something that you're really good it and
[46:13] you really love it uh then you can
[46:16] figure out a way how this could actually
[46:20] uh contribute a really good thing for
[46:22] the world uh and then you actually get
[46:24] also rewarded for that like if you find
[46:26] something that you you love and you're
[46:29] really good at it and the world needs it
[46:31] you will get rewarded for that and then
[46:34] you're like don't work anything because
[46:36] you just do what you love like you you
[46:37] stand up and and and you you do what uh
[46:41] you love it's kind of like my situation
[46:43] right now with with with YouTube because
[46:46] I'm doing it full-time now podcasting
[46:48] YouTube and all the stuff there's little
[46:51] amounts of work I have to do that I
[46:53] don't want to do is like for example
[46:55] filing taxes and stuff like that I I
[46:58] really don't want to do that but it's
[47:00] like kind of necessary to do the rest of
[47:03] the thing uh so when I Define work as
[47:07] something I don't really want to do but
[47:10] I have to do it uh then I'm working
[47:12] maybe like five to 10 hours a week uh
[47:16] for things that I have to do but I don't
[47:18] want to do and the rest of the time I'm
[47:20] just doing YouTube but if you define
[47:22] work with something that you get paid
[47:25] for yeah then I'm working like 70 hours
[47:27] a week I'm working a lot but it's it
[47:30] doesn't it does not work for me because
[47:32] I love it so much and uh and even if if
[47:36] I get all the money of the world I would
[47:38] not change a lot maybe I would hire
[47:40] someone to edit the videos and hire
[47:42] someone to do some of the work related
[47:45] to YouTube uh that I don't enjoy the
[47:47] most uh but it's also important for me
[47:50] that the thing is always mine so I I
[47:53] don't know if I even would hire someone
[47:55] because I really enjoy crafting the
[47:58] video exactly I want and and like the I
[48:02] do always a trailer like 30 40 seconds
[48:05] before the whole thing starts and
[48:08] picking the interesting parts from the
[48:11] video in putting in like picking from
[48:13] one hour uh interview like 30 seconds
[48:16] that you highlight in front of the video
[48:18] uh is also like a fun thing to do
[48:20] honestly and right if oh yeah good luck
[48:26] I I have
[48:29] put yeah I have I have process in but
[48:33] the the bite that I wanted to do make is
[48:34] like um if you only work for money you
[48:38] kind
[48:39] prostitute uh to to a certain extent but
[48:42] it's okay in a temporary sense uh if it
[48:46] if it serves a higher
[48:48] goal yeah but long term I would
[48:52] encourage everybody to find something
[48:55] you're good at
[48:57] and the world needs and everybody has
[48:59] something it would be something
[49:01] different for everybody uh and and yeah
[49:04] it's it's it's I'm really passionate
[49:07] about that also like I'm most I'm I'm
[49:09] mostly only talking about Bitcoin but I
[49:11] enjoy talking with so many bitcoiners
[49:13] because it also brings up different
[49:15] topics like that it says like IG has
[49:17] nothing to do with Bitcoin 3D printing
[49:20] has not a lot to do with Bitcoin yeah
[49:24] but it's it's it's fun to talk about
[49:26] that
[49:27] you congratulations crypto I I see you
[49:30] got the record order and you were
[49:32] literally making huge views I mean AR
[49:34] I'm proud of you man like I am proud of
[49:36] you like I I would I would love to
[49:38] emulate some of your success but that's
[49:40] on me to work hard to do that and so I
[49:42] kud to you thank you thank I appreciate
[49:45] that um yeah for the for the end of the
[49:48] interview um I have one thing that I've
[49:51] seen in your your profile it's your PIN
[49:53] post I always look at people's pin post
[49:56] because it's it's it's usually something
[49:58] important to them um you pin something
[50:01] with an IRA trust I did not understand
[50:03] it but I'm also not American like I also
[50:05] don't know what IRA and this 41k and
[50:07] stuff like that is can you is it
[50:10] something that that you want to share on
[50:11] this is something
[50:13] important yeah uh so I some some put
[50:16] that put that some advice on like a
[50:18] daily uh subred discussion thread at
[50:21] some point in the past a few years ago
[50:23] and then it got deleted and uh like it
[50:26] was so thought it was so important um
[50:28] because it was such good advice that I
[50:30] copied it and saved it there and that's
[50:33] just that like the like as an America
[50:35] and like if you were interested this is
[50:36] an ideal path and basically it's this
[50:38] right so an IRA is an individual
[50:40] retirement account right it is a
[50:42] mechanism that you can use to either
[50:45] store pre-tax money that hasn't been
[50:48] taxed yet or post tax money which is a
[50:50] Roth IR right and you can uh if you put
[50:54] post tax money in there it can grow to
[50:57] whatever size and after you know you
[50:59] reach a certain age you can just draw
[51:00] out from it it doesn't matter because
[51:01] you already paid the tax on it that's
[51:03] the the beauty of an IRA right of a Roth
[51:05] IRA regular Ira it's you take your money
[51:08] from before earnings and you just throw
[51:10] it into this retirement account so what
[51:13] this thing that I pasted there showing
[51:15] you is showing you the legal means to
[51:18] doing this but with your Bitcoin okay
[51:21] and so what you can do is you can form a
[51:25] trust like a trust LLC right that's not
[51:28] a you it's a separate legal entity and
[51:30] then you use this trust LLC to create
[51:34] its own Exchange accounts to have its
[51:36] own warrant its own treasure right to
[51:39] have to be able to store the book or to
[51:40] be able on paper be to be able show a
[51:43] distinct clu separation from your
[51:45] Bitcoin and this entity's Bitcoin
[51:49] understood and so therefore you
[51:52] basically have this entity act as the um
[51:57] what is it called like the power of
[51:58] attorney of your you know of your IRA
[52:02] account right pretty much it is listed
[52:04] as like the substrate the custodian of
[52:06] that Ira right of or that Roth IRA
[52:08] ideally so that you don't have to be
[52:10] taxed on the games right so you have it
[52:12] as this custodian of this Roth IRA and
[52:14] then very much in transact with that
[52:17] account that only has that name and that
[52:19] account is where you deposit your money
[52:22] that's the whole you know that's
[52:23] designated for you Roth area or whatever
[52:26] so being you to buy the Bitcoin from the
[52:28] exchange under that name on that account
[52:31] and then from that account you transfer
[52:33] that into the treasure that is also the
[52:35] property in custody of the trust right
[52:38] um and then therefore Lally that Bitcoin
[52:42] is now
[52:43] taxfree if you're doing it with a Roth
[52:45] IR like L it's taxfree do it with that
[52:47] right it must be done in that specific
[52:49] way in that specific order it does not
[52:51] work if you already had prior prior
[52:53] Bitcoin like whatever you do with the
[52:55] prior Bitcoin you will still be like
[52:57] under the veil of a liability tax
[52:59] situation so that that was why I I post
[53:01] that there because that is that's the
[53:04] advice that's the room like that you you
[53:06] want you want free off ticket in the
[53:07] sunset like that is the way and the way
[53:09] I know that this is legitimately is
[53:11] because if you read on it the B said he
[53:12] consulted it with his you know tax
[53:15] attorney and this is what the tax
[53:16] attorney laid
[53:18] out and so I mean yeah like it's I and
[53:22] that's the reason why I think that's
[53:23] it's really important like if you uh
[53:25] yeah like if
[53:27] you know if you're otherwise you can try
[53:29] to you know be like everybody else and
[53:30] just like I'm gonna hold on to it I'll
[53:32] do the best I can and I'll report the
[53:34] taxes I need to report the tax rate but
[53:36] you're going to have to be consistent D
[53:37] with your records and St a costing basis
[53:40] and stick with that costing basis I it's
[53:42] going to be the little first in first
[53:44] out
[53:45] um how don't know this is probably per
[53:48] advice but I would also tell somebody
[53:49] what you could do is you could um start
[53:52] an LLC right and you have the LLC spill
[53:55] your Bitcoin right into expenses and
[53:58] then the profitable gains off that you
[54:00] can offset that with the losses of you
[54:03] know like there's too much like defer
[54:06] and have it so that your company takes
[54:07] the losses and therefore it cancels out
[54:10] the payment that you have to pay on the
[54:12] capital games right and so it kind of
[54:13] makes it a flat zero I don't know if
[54:15] that really works well I know there's
[54:17] going to have to be limits to that
[54:18] you're not going to be able to spend
[54:19] like how you want to spend and once you
[54:21] actually have profitable years you're
[54:23] now cooking the books and that's Le so
[54:24] don't do that right and S um I mean but
[54:27] that's kinda that to me that's sort of
[54:29] like the quick and dirty probably the B
[54:31] we're going to do it and so what I put
[54:33] in my pin tweet is the proper way you
[54:36] should do it to have a minimized tax
[54:39] liability you want the tax liability to
[54:41] happen with the way so you're sending
[54:43] the after tax money through the Roth
[54:46] into the Bitcoin and therefore it's like
[54:48] now you know perfectly good and it
[54:50] doesn't matter if it's you know $600,000
[54:53] point or $1 million point or for million
[54:56] doll coin anymore you don't pay Uncle
[54:58] sad because you already did the taxes
[55:00] because it's now rough AB absolutely and
[55:03] then it's so important to even as
[55:08] bitcoiners are often turned off by the
[55:11] system and they don't want to hear too
[55:13] much of the usual system it's so
[55:16] important to uh investigate the system
[55:19] to understand the system and get the
[55:21] best out of the system you should not
[55:22] pay taxes when you don't have to pay
[55:25] taxes but you should also not break the
[55:26] law because this will have uh
[55:28] consequences on on you
[55:30] individually and yeah something I think
[55:34] as I said I think it's real
[55:36] important it a lot of people so a lot of
[55:38] folks that are getting into Bitcoin not
[55:40] everybody a lot of folks that have don't
[55:42] have much to lose and so once you're
[55:45] trying to look at the other side of it
[55:46] and you're trying to if maybe you're
[55:48] trying to pay off your house or maybe
[55:49] you're trying to BU more homes and stuff
[55:51] right like you now have something much
[55:54] more to lose and so you need to be
[55:56] careful what you're going to do and
[55:59] understand that the government is going
[56:01] to get paid like they're going to figure
[56:02] it out you're going to get autoed
[56:03] something's goingon to happen down the
[56:05] line so don't don't do ster short don't
[56:07] try to just just just do what you can
[56:09] and just R up to the sunset otherwise
[56:11] real rise these are risks you're
[56:14] taking yeah absolutely yeah uh then
[56:17] let's let's now come to the end routine
[56:19] of the podcast where the previous guest
[56:21] is asking a question for the next guest
[56:22] without knowing who the next guest
[56:24] actually is uh and your question from
[56:27] the previous guest is do you see any
[56:30] attacks coming on Layer Two free
[56:33] Technologies uh on top of Bitcoin that
[56:35] will try to capture
[56:37] Bitcoins absolutely I certainly do I
[56:41] most certainly do um I can't even think
[56:44] of them man but they they actually
[56:46] happen all the time you I mean like Ru
[56:50] like uh
[56:51] nfts uh
[56:53] orinal uh these are all attacks of
[56:56] Bitcoin these are all like thing that
[56:58] acts as an affinity scam to like try to
[57:01] bedazzle you with value or show that
[57:04] it's more important where it has a
[57:06] greater level of Rarity like it like a
[57:09] rare set like it's all an attack on
[57:11] bitcoin because it's made to enrichen
[57:14] funer by exploding the stupidity of the
[57:17] mini right um and these are it's crazy
[57:20] this is the lowest hanging fruit if you
[57:22] really want to talk about rural issues
[57:24] let's talk about St right like
[57:26] government all the governments they have
[57:28] the the eyes to look on us we have no
[57:30] idea how many people we transact with or
[57:32] how how many different poison lightning
[57:33] notes exist that are already doing the
[57:35] tracking and like they already have
[57:37] their own virtual separate red listings
[57:39] that they don't work because it doesn't
[57:41] work at a protocol level but they aity
[57:43] track and say oh see this is why we
[57:44] think these eight or nine rot sets of
[57:47] transaction IDs actually from Iran or
[57:50] actually from North Korea and we can
[57:52] show you how you know like it's scary
[57:54] because what's really happening is
[57:56] perhaps they're actually trapping you
[57:59] right it's like you innocuously sual to
[58:02] curring BS but they did it in such a way
[58:05] where they knew that they could send it
[58:06] and Route it to other notes that were
[58:08] not you know valid notes knowing that
[58:10] they're violating the lck they're doing
[58:12] it because they actually wanted to trap
[58:13] you as a bitcoiner they want to have you
[58:15] under their gun you know like this you I
[58:18] guarantee you this exists places now but
[58:21] it's probably not happening in The Bu
[58:22] places but it's a threat that will
[58:24] happen if it if it like if it doesn't
[58:27] already
[58:28] happen yeah that's uh I think I think
[58:32] there's a lot coming into bit world yeah
[58:36] like there will be lot
[58:38] coming like even like like even kind of
[58:41] right now so the biggest attack on
[58:42] bitcoin is like the the private sector
[58:44] in a way right like I mean just ining to
[58:46] want to like you know control it for our
[58:48] own to be like R seek and have like a
[58:52] new kind of a new form of rinek right
[58:54] that that to me is an attack on
[58:57] and yeah I think what I was mentioning
[58:58] earlier about satosi Nakamoto is yeah
[59:00] that I think for part of why end uping
[59:03] out was him seeing that yeah these are
[59:04] things that are going to happen and I
[59:05] don't want I don't want [ __ ] to do with
[59:07] this and I'm getting old and I'm getting
[59:09] sick or I'm like you know or I have a
[59:12] daughter that I want to see grow up or
[59:13] like things like that or right my mom's
[59:15] dying like things like that would have
[59:17] this person so I'm cool I need to just
[59:19] move on from
[59:21] bck yeah that's absolutely all right
[59:26] like we said right bitcoin's not the
[59:28] most important thing it's it's like the
[59:29] Dumbo feather it shows you that you are
[59:32] the most important thing to you and that
[59:34] you need to love your neighbor and show
[59:37] your neighbor that they need to love
[59:39] their neighbor right to me I think
[59:41] that's that's the the real
[59:43] way that's it's a beautiful way to to to
[59:47] kind of end the podcast I usually ask
[59:49] where can people reach you and follow
[59:51] you but we we already covered that that
