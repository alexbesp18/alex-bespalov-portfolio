[00:00] only 2% actually have hard holding your
[00:03] own Bitcoin is is superior to anything
[00:05] else exchange DMM Bitcoin got a hacked
[00:08] all $300 million worth of bitcoin
[00:10] Bitcoin was built as a peer-to-peer
[00:12] electronic cash system what if Apple
[00:14] account as
[00:19] Bitcoin definitely um I want to talk
[00:21] about what you just launched uh today
[00:23] but before I want to talk about that uh
[00:26] when you gave the presentation there was
[00:28] one fact standing out for me that only
[00:31] 2% actually have hard wallets like 2% of
[00:34] bitcoiners or crypto was it crypto or
[00:36] Bitcoin uh crypto crypto like 2% of
[00:38] crypto people have a hardware wallet
[00:41] which was shocking for me I knew it was
[00:43] low but 2% seems for me like really low
[00:46] um why do you think is that is um I
[00:50] think maybe I mean there are a couple
[00:52] hypothesis that that I have but of
[00:55] course I might be wrong but I think
[00:57] maybe uh Hardware worlds have have had
[01:00] this sort
[01:01] of um almost like if positioning on the
[01:05] market or you know the broader audience
[01:07] would think it's something that's hard
[01:09] to use maybe it's you know it's only for
[01:11] teis or you know it's not really user
[01:14] friendly and I think both us and
[01:17] honestly even our competitors I think we
[01:19] are proving that that's not no longer
[01:22] the case with every new device you know
[01:24] that one of us basically
[01:26] releases and so I hope people will see
[01:29] basically B adoption of of Hardware
[01:31] wallets you know because just have to I
[01:34] think we have to educate users as well
[01:36] because the other the other reason might
[01:38] be simply users or or customers or
[01:43] cryptos or whatever we call them so be
[01:45] scared of you know protecting their
[01:47] private Keys like I mean in terms of the
[01:49] backups um but again it's you know quite
[01:53] easy actually so it's not it's not that
[01:55] hard as maybe they might think H
[01:58] definitely and I know my audience are
[02:00] people that don't self custody because
[02:02] they tell me in the comments right um
[02:05] and I stress it out a lot in the podcast
[02:08] I always like if there's someone on that
[02:10] is connected to hard walls connected to
[02:12] self custody I'm always asking like
[02:14] what's the reason why we should do it
[02:16] because if we figure out why the the how
[02:19] and what is getting way easier and
[02:21] people like figure out because like ah
[02:23] you have some Hardware wallet providers
[02:25] you go on the internet buy them have
[02:26] some educational content about it the
[02:28] how is not that
[02:30] difficult these days especially if
[02:32] enhances but people seem to have like do
[02:35] why not like it's not big enough why do
[02:38] we need hards why do we need self
[02:41] custody right so what I also mentioned
[02:43] in the presentation was sort of the key
[02:45] message of what I was trying to say is
[02:48] um I mean I can say it like not not your
[02:51] keys your coins I know this sentence
[02:53] famous but let me try to explain cuz
[02:55] really there I think with race of
[02:58] institutional option of Bitcoin I think
[03:01] we see more and more products in the
[03:02] market I'm basically talking about ETFs
[03:04] as an example that sell it as a bit you
[03:08] know sell it as a Bitcoin almost or
[03:10] people newcomers basically are coming to
[03:12] bitcoin and crypto and to the industry
[03:15] might think it's Bitcoin but it's
[03:16] actually not a Bitcoin and the ETFs that
[03:19] they don't even hold they don't custody
[03:22] those Bitcoin themselves right so so I
[03:25] just think it would be quite important
[03:27] for the users and customers you know to
[03:31] understand this difference cuz I
[03:33] understand there are some pros and cons
[03:35] of of of both but obviously I believe
[03:39] that holding your own Bitcoin is is
[03:41] superior to anything else right
[03:44] because uh and I gave some examples um
[03:48] you know first you have the hacks right
[03:50] so and these hacks I mentioned a number
[03:53] of like 15 billion um you know dollars
[03:57] worth of bitcoin and crypto stolen or Lo
[04:00] or got lost let's say in in 2022 alone
[04:04] through hacks
[04:05] bankruptcies uh you know all kind of
[04:07] scams and and just recently I think uh
[04:10] your listeners might even know this
[04:13] Japanese you know major uh exchange DMM
[04:16] Bitcoin if I if I'm not butchering the
[04:18] name uh got a hacked of 300 million uh
[04:22] dollar worth of bitcoin just you know
[04:23] couple weeks ago so so those are real
[04:26] and because of the nature of Bitcoin
[04:30] uh once those you know coins get lost
[04:33] there's no way to I mean there's no
[04:35] insurance policy those are basically
[04:36] lost uh for for good um and so it's why
[04:41] you know protecting your own private
[04:43] keys in in self- custody and exactly
[04:47] with products that are made and and are
[04:49] really good at this yeah it's basically
[04:52] Superior I think it's better uh another
[04:54] reason is basically if you the farther
[04:56] you get from real self self- custody the
[04:58] more fees you might pay on those cdfs or
[05:02] some fund managers or custodians or
[05:04] whatever you basically pay you have to
[05:05] pay because there's some intermediary of
[05:07] course it's their business you know for
[05:09] them to hold your keys so and I would
[05:12] like the main also reason I think is
[05:15] basically Bitcoin was built as a
[05:17] peer-to-peer electronic cash system so
[05:19] you know if that sounds familiar that's
[05:20] exactly what it is you know that's how
[05:22] Satoshi invented it and I and I don't
[05:25] think we should respect it just you know
[05:26] because it was you know satsh idea and
[05:29] we all respect him but because it makes
[05:31] sense it's it's great right it's that's
[05:33] the innovation of of basically money um
[05:36] the hard money so yeah so I think that's
[05:40] better basically and that's uh all the
[05:42] risk uh that you ped out this was on the
[05:46] individual level uh do you also see uh
[05:50] on a greater scale risks for example
[05:53] like when you see the gold history the
[05:55] confiscated gold basically to stabilize
[05:58] the the US dollar uh the like what was
[06:01] it the exe executive order
[06:04] 6102 uh which they made is is that at
[06:06] some point when when governments see
[06:08] like oh there's like a big tank in the
[06:11] coinbase account there's a big tank in
[06:13] all the ETFs accounts and it's like all
[06:15] use some some countries uh some
[06:17] companies do you see a risk in in that
[06:20] at some point because the US dollar is
[06:22] crashing uh the field system is crashing
[06:24] and and government is like ah let's
[06:26] let's take those Bitcoins uh and
[06:28] stabilize it and uh sell it that way to
[06:30] the Govern uh to the public mhm I mean I
[06:34] don't see it honestly happening in like
[06:36] let's say the Western um democracies or
[06:39] something like this because I think
[06:41] exactly what we saw this year uh was
[06:43] that you know CC basically approved EDF
[06:45] and and I think I mean and and and we
[06:47] heard you know the presidents the
[06:49] presidential candidates talking about it
[06:51] so I think it's it got to a point where
[06:53] this would be quite hard even like
[06:56] politically because I I can I cannot see
[06:57] that happening because Wall Street wants
[07:00] to get you know piece of you know
[07:02] basically Bitcoin in terms of you know
[07:04] selling selling the products uh as
[07:06] Bitcoin so I'm I don't see that
[07:08] happening in unless you know something
[07:11] super crazy happens you know I don't
[07:12] know like politically or really like
[07:15] maybe not like in democratic nations
[07:18] um but but yeah I think the as I
[07:23] mentioned the institutional adoption is
[07:25] is gone quite far with Bitcoin I think
[07:28] it's good for I mean it's a good
[07:31] marketing for Bitcoin for sure uh but I
[07:34] would still recommend to the individual
[07:37] you know owners to try to keep those you
[07:39] know Keys um for themselves
[07:42] so um sorry I just away from the
[07:46] question but but uh I I don't think that
[07:48] that would happened I I don't see that
[07:50] but I might be wrong and then the
[07:53] individuals that have the Bitcoin uh
[07:56] themselves they cannot be uh affected by
[07:59] that
[08:00] that's that's like another reason on
[08:02] individual level um now let's talk a
[08:05] little bit about what treasure the
[08:08] company uh that we are also now sitting
[08:11] in uh just announced at bit Bitcoin
[08:13] Prague uh I really like the the video
[08:16] but what is like uh all the underlying
[08:18] stuff like why did you make those design
[08:21] choices we have now a touchcreen instead
[08:22] of the the the buttons um let's have a
[08:25] little bit deeper like what was the
[08:26] thought process uh behind the new
[08:28] product mhm M so uh I would say there's
[08:32] a natural Continuum from two different
[08:34] angles one is our treaser safe series
[08:38] which last year we we launched Jer a 3
[08:41] which is smaller device with two buttons
[08:43] smaller display not touch display you
[08:45] know Etc uh our two previous models are
[08:48] treer model one and treer Model T T and
[08:51] exactly the second angle is basically
[08:53] the treasure C 5 is also a Continuum of
[08:55] a treasure Model D which is built in um
[08:59] the J say 5 has a similar shape you know
[09:02] it's the shape is Iconic for us now so
[09:04] so that's sort of the Continuum of of
[09:06] that the that product specifically as
[09:09] well uh and yeah jar say 5 is now our
[09:12] Flagship product in terms of it's the
[09:14] sort of the most userfriendly hardare
[09:17] Vol that we have ever built is as you
[09:19] mentioned the the color touch screen it
[09:22] has the hoptic feedback so you know all
[09:25] those sort of uh interaction with the
[09:27] devices really are really easy and nice
[09:29] a lot of animations swipe gestures uh
[09:32] and and stuff like that so um and also I
[09:36] would say we focus quite a lot on like
[09:39] really I would say beautiful design you
[09:40] know in the sense like uh to make things
[09:42] really like pretty um and so that's
[09:46] where we spent a lot of time sort of um
[09:49] you know working with a specific firm
[09:51] factor of you know the device and and
[09:54] how would uh users you know interact
[09:56] with it and and for them to really enjoy
[09:59] sort of this consumer electronics almost
[10:01] like mainstreams feel feel of it what do
[10:04] you see as the The Next Step uh we
[10:07] talked about right before uh we recorded
[10:10] with you we recorded with Michael S and
[10:11] he actually touched on uh the scaling
[10:14] possibilities of of Bitcoin and he
[10:17] touched on the possibility that like
[10:19] what if Apple encounters Bitcoin and
[10:22] they all of the they like ah we we want
[10:26] them to custody their Bitcoin with the
[10:29] device cles they already have with apple
[10:30] and they build uh um the hard wallets
[10:33] and the Apple watch and the iPhones and
[10:35] whatnot uh do you imagine because this
[10:38] was the thought that I had also with
[10:40] treasure uh this thing looks more more
[10:42] like a
[10:44] phone um is is that the future where we
[10:47] going where like uh the and treasure
[10:49] iPhone uh where we're going in this
[10:52] direction where like a treasure is built
[10:54] in in the devices we already use and and
[10:57] and have with like an Apple Watch and an
[10:59] iPhone and then there's an iPad and if
[11:01] you want to sign a transaction you need
[11:02] two of those right I don't see it
[11:04] happening any in any near future uh
[11:07] there's a couple simple reasons for it
[11:09] uh the hardware buets are specifically
[11:12] built as um sort of simple devices uh
[11:15] that have one you know single purpose
[11:17] devices in that sense uh and the reason
[11:19] is exactly to kind of try to disconnect
[11:22] them from anything that could um mess
[11:24] with your keys right so once and and
[11:27] it's by the way why we build everything
[11:29] out in the open as an open source as
[11:31] much as we can uh because you know we
[11:34] are basically audited by all the experts
[11:36] uh and the community and anybody can
[11:39] sort of um you know kind of check on how
[11:42] things are wired you know if I if I put
[11:44] it this way but if you are talking about
[11:46] you know companies like apple Etc they
[11:48] they would never allow you to see what's
[11:50] happening there uh so from security
[11:52] stand point of you it's not honestly
[11:55] great it's it's not the best and
[11:57] obviously these devices are doing so
[11:59] many different things so you could
[12:00] finally easy you could easily probably
[12:03] find some some back doors you know to
[12:05] that specific use case which is like
[12:07] keeping your uh private key secure so I
[12:10] I know I don't see that happening any
[12:13] any in any like near future I don't
[12:15] think you know technically we are we are
[12:18] able to do this on the hardware level on
[12:21] the software level yes there are certain
[12:23] you know cosigning a multi6 etc where
[12:26] you know maybe you have one key you know
[12:28] somewhere um some Hardware on you know
[12:30] some other Hardware you know those those
[12:32] are more realistic but I would still
[12:35] think we should you know use uh like
[12:37] specific devices for this where do you
[12:40] see the the future going when we have
[12:43] like I mean ask that myself a lot where
[12:46] where is Bitcoin self custody in general
[12:48] going we also have the constraint of
[12:50] like uh Bitcoin on chain transactions
[12:53] will be
[12:54] expensive uh so we will move to other uh
[12:58] layers so maybe the problem is not there
[13:00] because onchain self custody will be a
[13:03] thing of really big institutional Banks
[13:05] or like big
[13:07] individuals um but where do you see this
[13:10] uh shift in in in in self custody uh
[13:13] Solutions do do you do you imagine like
[13:16] an treasure in 10 years or like what's
[13:18] the Future Vision for for like that yeah
[13:20] so we would definitely like to uh uh
[13:23] let's say Implement some second layer
[13:25] you know and and be able to process or
[13:28] let's say for our users to be able to
[13:30] process um uh transaction inexpensively
[13:34] let's say or make transaction
[13:36] inexpensively directly from chure and
[13:39] it's true that we are looking at certain
[13:40] you know basically whatever is happening
[13:42] in in in terms of like scalability on
[13:45] bitcoin but as where we will be in like
[13:48] 10 years I have no idea because they
[13:50] honestly like to be completely honest
[13:52] because there are you know many
[13:53] different proposals uh it seems there
[13:56] are some pros and cons in all of those
[13:58] and I don't think we have like a single
[14:00] bullet solution at this point you you
[14:02] know to be to be
[14:04] honest and it's totally fun because um
[14:07] Bitcoin is such an early uh technology
[14:10] it's such an early thing and there's a
[14:13] lot of questions still in the in the
[14:15] whole community and a whole uh
[14:16] technology like um it it's hard to think
[14:20] of of the future and how it all turns
[14:22] out that's why I'm really curious always
[14:24] to like like how how do we do it in the
[14:27] future and have all those different
[14:29] opinions and then we'll have like a lot
[14:31] of different perspectives on the topics
[14:32] and we we might have figured out a
[14:34] direction which is is really cool um
[14:37] before we go in into other topics uh I
[14:41] want to give um people an understanding
[14:45] uh when they should self custody uh uh
[14:48] and and what you personally recommend us
[14:51] like and uh okay when you have that many
[14:55] like if if you have if you're on that
[14:57] level you should figure out like maybe
[14:59] more multi uh when you should you get
[15:02] your your first Hardware wallet because
[15:05] obviously if you has just 10 euros in in
[15:07] Bitcoin you probably don't buy a
[15:09] treasure because the investment is
[15:11] higher than than the thing that you're
[15:13] carrying on it um so like what what do
[15:15] you usually recommend like when does it
[15:17] make sense to get a treasure when does
[15:18] it make sense to uh step up the game and
[15:21] have multiple devices signing something
[15:23] right so I like to think of this as
[15:27] because we are a global company or
[15:28] really everywhere uh I don't think there
[15:30] are specific sort of numbers that you
[15:32] can put on this it really depends on
[15:34] your income your assets you know all
[15:36] that stuff so I don't think there's a
[15:38] general number that we could use uh
[15:40] maybe just in the case like how much is
[15:43] the uh is the hardware wallet right so
[15:45] that's the base that you can you can
[15:47] work with um but also I would like to
[15:50] see or I would love for newcomers coming
[15:52] to the industry even consider starting
[15:55] with uh with hardare wallet directly uh
[15:58] and I will try to explain Why by the way
[15:59] I'm totally not against people starting
[16:01] you know on Exchange if it's you know
[16:04] just a little for them you know right
[16:07] that's perfectly uh I think perfectly
[16:09] fine to kind of try to experience you
[16:11] know not have some uh some worries about
[16:14] all this crypto stuff um but I think you
[16:19] know because we we are really
[16:20] implementing uh also some cool features
[16:23] in our uh software ecosystem you know
[16:26] you can really buy sell Exchange coins
[16:29] on through Treasure Suite which is like
[16:31] the software uh that we that we have
[16:33] together with with uh the treasure
[16:35] devices so yeah I would love to see when
[16:39] newcomers consider this as an as an idea
[16:41] uh just and I will try to explain why
[16:43] because they could start sort of their
[16:45] Journey there to try to explain them
[16:47] everything uh about self custody you
[16:49] know Bitcoin Etc and they can really
[16:52] sort of Step Up um and become more
[16:56] experienced through something that is
[16:59] in my opinion again Superior way of you
[17:02] know owning Bitcoin and also you can
[17:04] keep St stacking basically more on I
[17:09] mean not just uh like the funds itself
[17:11] or the assets itself but also like the
[17:13] knowledge you know so you kind of you
[17:15] know experience more really owning those
[17:17] private Keys you know and as you said we
[17:19] are very still still early and
[17:22] especially again with this institution
[17:24] going to bitcoin it really my Skyrocket
[17:27] I imagine in you know to two bull bull
[17:31] runs down the road and I think it'll be
[17:34] those people who will you know get into
[17:36] self cust early um you know and really
[17:40] will have their coins again the private
[17:42] Keys might I think benefit quite a lot
[17:44] from this from the knowledge and also
[17:46] from starting the journey you know in in
[17:48] self custody and education is so key I
[17:51] told that story a lot of on on on my
[17:53] podcast but uh I fought for three years
[17:55] straight at Bitcoin as a scam then I I
[17:58] kind of acknowledge that I ran out of
[18:00] arguments against that and I was like on
[18:02] a Friday I was like I want to figure out
[18:04] Bitcoin out and want to explain to my
[18:06] friends why Bitcoin is a scam yeah uh
[18:09] and this weekend I discovered Bitcoin
[18:11] Monday I bought the Bitcoin Tuesday I
[18:14] bought my first hard wallet back then it
[18:17] was few years ago please forgive me a
[18:19] ledger perfectly
[18:21] fine uh and uh this is I did this only I
[18:26] did not understand the EOS of bitco I
[18:29] not understand why self custody makes
[18:31] sense I was a stock guy I I just like
[18:33] had it on an exchange because with
[18:35] stocks you don't have any other option
[18:38] but uh I did this because of learning I
[18:41] just like transferred from coinbase to
[18:43] Ledger from ler back to coinbase back to
[18:46] my bank account uh to see everything and
[18:48] and get get to know Bitcoin and that's
[18:50] why I also recommend actually getting uh
[18:53] a harder wallet as soon as you're coming
[18:55] into Bitcoin space I bought it literally
[18:57] like full days before I after that I
[19:01] thought it's a scam uh where I saw my
[19:03] first videos uh and I made a lot of
[19:06] mistakes but I made those mistakes with
[19:09] small amounts of Bitcoins with small
[19:11] amounts of of money to to learn from it
[19:13] so I really love that you you said that
[19:15] point with with education uh it's an
[19:18] underrated one and you should definitely
[19:20] definitely do that not when your whole
[19:21] network is 10 EUR uh but uh if if you
[19:24] have uh uh more than that and and you
[19:27] really want to get to know
[19:29] uh Bitcoin it's it's an amazing uh way
[19:32] to do that yeah and thanks for saying it
[19:35] because yeah I obviously obviously agree
[19:38] and again uh just to you know give
[19:41] basically Kudos so because like those 2%
[19:44] I mean of course we are competitors with
[19:45] other companies Etc but still I would
[19:47] like to kind of give Kos to other hard
[19:49] wallet makers as well for I mean trying
[19:51] to make better devices and biger better
[19:53] user experience you know it's it's it
[19:55] helps improve us I mean it's it's
[19:58] healthy we have you know competition and
[20:00] again us as the whole you know Hardware
[20:02] world industry we are still like small
[20:05] and I think we can grow significantly
[20:07] and I'm glad that we are we are really
[20:09] bringing these uh new cool Hardware
[20:11] walls that I think people might really
[20:14] enjoy starting their Journey sort of
[20:17] with Bitcoin right so straight away yeah
[20:19] we talked before in in the car about
[20:21] that uh it's like when you have a whole
[20:25] market and 2% of a hardware wallet mhm
[20:28] like you don't even have to focus on
[20:30] your competitors because you have 98% of
[20:34] your Market that's basically free
[20:36] available uh and you you you just have
[20:38] to Market to the those bitcoiners who
[20:41] don't have selfcast Rel it's pretty
[20:44] awesome actually uh when you have such a
[20:46] an amazing marketing opportunity yeah
[20:48] yeah exactly so I think instead of
[20:49] killing each other we definitely should
[20:52] I mean and I think we we we all of us do
[20:54] kind of focus on on you know moving
[20:57] people from the I think target actually
[20:59] from exchanges to Hardware vet I think
[21:01] that's the sort of the easiest and the
[21:03] shortest uh kind of segue to to to
[21:06] proper self custody uh so so yeah I I
[21:09] totally agree and again on the other
[21:11] side it is also good to have a little
[21:12] bit of you know competition and and if
[21:14] if you know one of us you know UPS
[21:17] whatever it's it's good like I think to
[21:19] I mean it's again healthy and and of
[21:20] course we are businesses and competitive
[21:22] businesses uh but ultimately you know
[21:25] like yeah we still early and still small
[21:29] in this sense if you watch or listen to
[21:31] my podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[21:34] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[21:36] the most important step is to keep the
[21:39] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[21:42] wallet my personal recommendation for
[21:44] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[21:46] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[21:49] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[21:51] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[21:54] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[21:58] the checkout visit bitbox Swiss robobin
[22:02] to get your bitbox and if you really
[22:04] want to bulletproof your self custody
[22:07] setup your security setup and maybe even
[22:09] your citizenship setup you have to talk
[22:13] to the Bitcoin way if you go to the
[22:15] Bitcoin way.com
[22:17] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[22:21] free call where you can dive deep with
[22:24] them if your self custody setup is
[22:27] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[22:30] maybe might be improvable or your
[22:32] digital footprint in general is secure
[22:36] they are the experts in cyber security
[22:39] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[22:42] secure sovereign individual in general
[22:45] and for those of you who are in search
[22:47] of a new Bitcoin exchange where they can
[22:48] buy their Bitcoin from I recommend my
[22:51] personal Bitcoin exchange 21 Bitcoin
[22:54] with code Robin you get a hefty discount
[22:58] for all your purchases in the future
[23:00] this this also protects the consumer
[23:02] because if if if if treasure does
[23:06] something uh that is not good uh you can
[23:09] basically count on that that uh other
[23:12] companies like leer bitbox will um will
[23:15] point that out in somehow so it it all
[23:19] like competition is always good but that
[23:21] I think with a Bitcoin libertarian
[23:24] audience really have to tell this um
[23:27] another thing that you launched um I
[23:30] think it's the first time that you have
[23:32] this a Bitcoin only device is it the
[23:33] first time it's the first time we so
[23:35] with treaser save 3 the previous model
[23:38] we launched a limited edition only 2013
[23:41] pieces that was sort of a testament or
[23:44] like a celebration of the history of the
[23:46] company because it was established in
[23:48] 2013 and uh it was like a it was limited
[23:51] edition it was really successful and and
[23:54] because it sold out within the first day
[23:56] basically within the first 24 hours
[23:59] so we decided uh because we saw this big
[24:01] demand to um to launch the BTC only uh
[24:06] devices as you know kind of start
[24:09] standard product in in our portfolio
[24:12] though those people who bought the
[24:14] limited edition they don't have to worry
[24:15] like in that that would be somehow it
[24:18] would miss something because those uh
[24:20] limit that limited edition was really
[24:22] like engrave there was like numbers so
[24:24] so it's it's cool and they also all got
[24:26] um like a um uh written note from from
[24:30] slash and stake the founders of of of
[24:33] our company and the founders of
[24:35] basically the whole industry I love it
[24:38] um I find I found it fascinating that uh
[24:42] hard wallet um producers and providers
[24:45] are making more and more like Bitcoin
[24:47] only uh firmware Bitcoin only uh
[24:50] products um why is that like because
[24:55] like if you have a treasure and you can
[24:56] use Bitcoin and you can all the other
[24:58] coins also um it's basically like I can
[25:02] just do Bitcoin with that um why do we
[25:05] need uh a Bitcoin like sounds like a
[25:08] weird question when I'm on a Bitcoin
[25:09] only podcast but why do we need this the
[25:12] Bitcoin only Dev I perfectly understand
[25:13] the question so I think it's uh one is I
[25:16] think Bitcoin maximalism that you
[25:18] basically don't want to see
[25:20] any paron my language any shitcoins you
[25:22] know in there in the interface so that's
[25:25] definitely one I think and it's a it's
[25:27] it's a valid I think you might even be
[25:29] worried you know why it even supports
[25:31] something like from security reason even
[25:33] security wise it's it's it's all safe
[25:35] you know you don't have to worry if if
[25:37] if the firware supports Ain it's you
[25:39] know uh it's perfectly safe um so I
[25:43] would say this is barly the main reason
[25:45] also specifically with treasure we have
[25:48] the orange devices so you know it's it
[25:50] has some let's say color to it as well
[25:53] so you can maybe hold your uh Bitcoin on
[25:56] really like an orange device and maybe
[25:59] you know the other coins on on something
[26:00] else so you can even differentiate the
[26:02] two uh but yeah I think that's the kind
[26:05] of this sort of EOS as you mentioned is
[26:07] is the is the is the main um main reason
[26:11] and and you know quite honestly I mean
[26:13] you like it we are bitcoiners you know
[26:15] like of course we have also altcoin
[26:17] teams and experts on on altcoins in in
[26:20] our company for sure because we are
[26:22] protecting you know keys not just from
[26:24] from Bitcoin but other cryptocurrencies
[26:26] even though we are quite conservative in
[26:27] that regard as well by the way but but
[26:30] yeah we like it we like it ourselves so
[26:33] we like to build products that we you
[26:34] know enjoy there a question that I never
[26:36] asked because I was never in my head
[26:38] because I'm Bitcoin only is there a
[26:40] difference uh between all the
[26:42] cryptocurrencies that you support where
[26:44] like I have to do a different thing on
[26:46] the device just then like is there
[26:49] fundamental difference in in holding the
[26:51] keys of like some altcoin Solana
[26:54] ethereum kadano then do Bitcoin uh yes
[26:58] but that being said I'm not an engineer
[26:59] so I would not be able to give you like
[27:01] details but I know yeah the teams need
[27:03] to sort of uh there's always something
[27:05] different that you uh I as far as I
[27:08] understand cryptography wise it's pretty
[27:10] much similar like the concept like in
[27:12] terms of security uh but of course there
[27:14] are some nuances and and differences
[27:16] between between those networks and
[27:18] that's also why probably said like we
[27:20] are a bit conservative so we kind of see
[27:22] the given Network that we would support
[27:25] uh has tractions has users you know has
[27:27] Trading and all that
[27:30] stuff because we want want to see that
[27:33] it's not going to die out you know the
[27:35] next week after the release right I mean
[27:38] quite honestly we even have or had coins
[27:41] that are basically dead you know like
[27:43] and we are supporting them in in feare
[27:45] so we just like discontinu them because
[27:47] you know was there was some hype in the
[27:49] past maybe like 2017 I think there was
[27:51] like this outo craze and then yeah it's
[27:55] it doesn't make sense and it's a defocus
[27:56] for us it's yeah it's you know we should
[28:00] be have like have like a laser eye focus
[28:02] on the really important stuff so yeah
[28:05] definitely and um I was in the situation
[28:07] where short period of my time last year
[28:10] I was a head of a branch kind of a CEO
[28:14] of a small company really small company
[28:16] uh so I know that there's always this
[28:18] question like oh how much revenue do we
[28:21] do we do in the next quarter how much R
[28:23] are you expecting the one year and you
[28:25] also as the treasure CEO um how how much
[28:29] do you calculate and how much do you see
[28:32] that like my question basically is how
[28:36] does Treasure prepare for the upcoming
[28:39] or the next Bull Run that might happen
[28:42] in the next like 18 months and it might
[28:44] be really crazy it might not be that
[28:46] crazy and do how do you calculate for
[28:48] that and how do you prepare treasure for
[28:50] something like that yeah it's a it's a
[28:53] very relevant question for a hardware
[28:55] business because uh Hardware is hard as
[28:58] it's this famous sentence in all
[28:59] Hardware companies uh and it's hard
[29:02] because well because it's a
[29:04] hardware you know it's you need you you
[29:06] need a stock basically you need a
[29:08] physical material like when you're a
[29:09] software company uh you know it scales
[29:12] pretty well it's it scales sort of
[29:14] infinitely um well to certain degree
[29:17] because maybe some Beacon capacity blah
[29:18] blah blah but like yeah it it's SC as
[29:20] well if if you up you just make a
[29:22] new release and you fix it next week or
[29:25] even next day you know like a hot fix
[29:27] patch or whatever in Hardware uh no
[29:30] though that's way way way way more
[29:32] complicated uh because all those
[29:34] components that get on the PCB and you
[29:36] know the mboard and into the device you
[29:39] really need to have you know huge
[29:41] quantities of those if you're if you are
[29:42] talking about bull market because the
[29:44] demand uh as we see in Bitcoin itself
[29:47] like it can jump you know it can
[29:48] Skyrocket from one week to another uh
[29:51] and by the way Bitcoin is doing the best
[29:52] marketing for us so whenever uh Bitcoin
[29:55] is pumping uh we we our sales are going
[29:58] up right so so it's you know if if you
[30:01] look at the graph and it's it's pretty
[30:03] much correlated all the time
[30:06] so that means uh and these components by
[30:08] the way some of them are uh what you
[30:10] deal with is the lead times which
[30:13] basically means you know some of the
[30:14] components might be might not be in your
[30:18] inventory within the first I don't know
[30:20] even weeks month it can take even longer
[30:23] you might have some components that you
[30:24] wait really 6 months before you get them
[30:26] from the producer the manufacturer of
[30:29] the actual component um so you have to
[30:31] you know put all this on one pile then
[30:34] start producing devices which also take
[30:36] sometimes obviously you know to put all
[30:38] the components together uh you test them
[30:40] uh you make sure that everything is
[30:43] secure you upload the
[30:45] firmware um or you know the um yeah
[30:50] basically uh the software that would
[30:53] allow you then you know to upload the
[30:54] firmware Etc and uh and this all takes
[30:58] time you know so it's not again it's not
[31:00] we are not talking about weeks it's we
[31:01] are talking about months or or even more
[31:05] so that's hard that's hard with the
[31:08] hardware and what we do is we we also
[31:10] need to support it with cash so we need
[31:13] to have a lot like really good cash flow
[31:14] in terms of to be able to support this
[31:16] and really manage our cash flow well uh
[31:18] to make sure we are able to build enough
[31:21] of these when the demand picks
[31:23] up I love that I see the the patterns
[31:26] through all the the Bitcoin comp comp
[31:28] because everyone is telling me Oh when
[31:30] the priz is doing stuff our sales is
[31:32] doing stuff is it also like because you
[31:35] said like when it's going up is it also
[31:36] when it's going down like yes it is it
[31:38] is the same I actually you said it uh
[31:41] better than I you mentioned whatever
[31:43] doing whatever Bitcoin is doing you know
[31:45] we are it it has impact on our sales as
[31:47] well so but I just say just one what say
[31:51] one thing when I joined the company you
[31:53] know 200 Min is like 19 or something um
[31:58] you're basically like an operating loss
[32:01] um and because it was it was Bare market
[32:05] so and it was much much much smaller
[32:07] team and now uh even in the bare markets
[32:12] we are still doing pretty well even with
[32:13] much bigger team so obviously you know
[32:15] Bitcoin is growing and so it's also sort
[32:18] of the absolute uh I guess the price of
[32:21] Bitcoin uh and the more money there more
[32:23] people that are uh in Bitcoin and I
[32:27] guess doing more TR etc etc that are
[32:29] basically keeping uh our company well
[32:32] even in the bare Market
[32:34] times I love it a lot what do you expect
[32:36] from the the the Bull Run is is do you
[32:39] have some something in in mind what what
[32:41] what's coming next I mean it's like
[32:43] there two sides was like obviously there
[32:45] the price which is impossible to predict
[32:47] you can throw out numbers uh and
[32:50] everyone has his own numbers and but
[32:52] there's the other part we like what
[32:55] happens fundamentally like we have now
[32:58] countries in we have now public util
[33:00] companies in we have ETF now in uh is is
[33:03] there anything that you would be like I
[33:05] think that will happen in Bitcoin in the
[33:07] next like five years yeah well I
[33:10] definitely see the institutions moving
[33:14] in for sure so I guess banks will be
[33:16] next in that sense uh I'm quite sure of
[33:20] that um so for sure I think also and I'm
[33:24] hoping like more individual users as
[33:26] well so if you talk not just like
[33:28] through intermediaries but really people
[33:30] that would get ideally into self-
[33:32] custody ideally of in Hardware self-
[33:34] custody uh so yeah the growth I think is
[33:38] is quite
[33:40] obvious I also hope we are past the time
[33:44] where well I don't have to hope I think
[33:46] it's it's it was always like that
[33:48] basically Bitcoin will stay with us
[33:50] that's for sure from basically day one
[33:53] but um like in terms of uh you know the
[33:56] technology how how it's how it's done uh
[33:59] and and I just yeah I just hope more
[34:02] people would would own you know their
[34:05] private keys and and I hope there will
[34:08] be a lot lot more of them basically like
[34:10] a lot more I mean people you know moving
[34:12] to
[34:13] bitcoin it's also like because you with
[34:15] prior Keys um we talked about a little
[34:17] bit before the recording about the
[34:19] importance of a peer-to-peer Network
[34:22] like as satosi actually intended it to
[34:25] do uh that's so important and a lot of
[34:28] people feel like now with the
[34:29] institutional money coming in with ETFs
[34:31] and I get a little bit tired honestly of
[34:34] of the Twitter like oh so many inflows
[34:36] of the ETFs today and so many outflows
[34:38] and why is the pr like I never I never
[34:41] saw a single sheet of paper where the
[34:43] inflows like I never followed that um
[34:46] get does the the the eforce of of
[34:49] Bitcoin get lost a little bit uh or is
[34:53] that just maturing uh is that just the
[34:55] asset maturing
[34:57] I I guess it it's both and depending
[35:00] where you sit on the on the spectrum of
[35:03] why you are in Bitcoin uh that's how you
[35:05] look at it right like how much it
[35:07] bothers you either of those
[35:10] so yeah I mean satosi himself I mean
[35:13] quotes these uh you know Banks being
[35:15] built out you know in 2009 you know
[35:18] after the 2008 uh financial
[35:21] crisis and I think it's kind of pity
[35:23] that we are honestly I mean uh What's
[35:27] happen
[35:28] even now and and will probably happen
[35:30] more in the future as we said before is
[35:32] I mean with the banks and stuff I mean
[35:35] if it you know you know looks like Fiat
[35:37] if it smells like
[35:38] Fiat it's I mean I'm not saying it's
[35:41] Fiat necessarily maybe it's like some
[35:42] security Etc but like you know it's not
[35:45] Bitcoin so just you know get into
[35:47] Bitcoin just you know
[35:50] so yeah I kind of share the same
[35:52] sentiment in in that sense right like
[35:54] it's uh I think it's I I guess it is our
[35:58] job as the Bitcoin companies to really
[36:01] try to educate as many people as we can
[36:04] to not you know jump on these products
[36:07] that are called Bitcoin but they are not
[36:10] Bitcoin itself yeah just wrap Bitcoin or
[36:13] paper Bitcoin or I use however we want
[36:16] to call it and I also like I I made a
[36:18] interview with Grafton from vexel and
[36:21] it's like part of s Labs which is is a
[36:23] pairing company of treasure uh if if
[36:26] people are not
[36:28] I love loved a lot of that interview
[36:30] because he really is like it's peerto
[36:32] peer it's like it's that it's not thef
[36:36] and I L A lot of those uh those things I
[36:39] love also that like treasure is involved
[36:42] with uh Vel
[36:44] and is supporting those kind of efforts
[36:47] are you how is there like um a create a
[36:51] connection with vexel for your for
[36:53] yourself is it like do you do do you
[36:56] also see that vexel something that is
[36:59] really cool uh yeah yeah of course I
[37:01] mean I'm I'm wearing a vexel band as
[37:04] well here oh nice I mean we like them of
[37:06] course we are you know in the same
[37:08] building Etc so so yeah and by the way I
[37:11] would say um I I don't think I mean I'm
[37:14] not
[37:15] saying you know we should do things
[37:17] because Satoshi wanted us to we should
[37:20] do things satosi uh said because they
[37:24] make sense because it's it's uh again
[37:27] again like after financial crisis how
[37:29] many financial crisis were there you
[37:31] know like uh uh the fractional you know
[37:35] Reserve Banking and stuff like it's I
[37:37] mean it's kind of I feel like we could
[37:39] run into situation when we are repeating
[37:41] the exact same same issues uh with
[37:45] basically centralized institutions you
[37:48] know um basically fraud you know because
[37:52] uh I mean I'm not an expert in financial
[37:54] markets or anything I just see I mean
[37:57] it's like a it looks like a pattern
[37:59] almost right like so so we have this
[38:01] amazing thing it's called Bitcoin we
[38:04] could you know really you know hold it
[38:05] yourself uh peer-to-peer all that stuff
[38:09] and then you would just lock it in you
[38:10] know some massive institution and that
[38:13] you would uh trade security so you know
[38:16] you trade it as a security I mean like
[38:18] why you know like you know so I don't
[38:21] know it's um so so yeah I obviously like
[38:25] the the peer-to-peer uh stuff reel is
[38:28] doing I think it's it's great amazing
[38:30] and before we come to the endro before
[38:31] we come uh to the wrap up of the the
[38:34] podcast I'm always asking one question
[38:36] to uh almost all of my podcast it's
[38:40] not it's not really my end routin I'm
[38:44] asking that question because I think
[38:46] bitcoiner are unique people because they
[38:49] see now something that is really early
[38:52] and might get a really great adoption
[38:54] later on so they are critical thinking
[38:56] they're really open they have some
[38:58] uniqueness to them they're Freedom
[39:00] orientated and I'm asking always that
[39:02] question um what does freedom mean to
[39:07] you wow it's a it's a nice
[39:10] question
[39:16] um I think it's the
[39:19] individual ability to do sort of
[39:21] whatever you want uh as long as of
[39:24] course you're not stealing right from
[39:26] somebody else that's something like
[39:27] decided I maybe there's some better
[39:29] sentence a quote on this but uh yeah I
[39:33] think it's it's kind of this like by the
[39:35] way I personally love mountains a lot I
[39:39] you know like fly parag gliders I love
[39:41] Mountain wearing and it's and the the
[39:44] reason why I do this is exactly it is
[39:46] because like I love this you know
[39:47] ultimate Freedom that you're kind of
[39:49] even like look at the world from really
[39:51] like from from high up literally and so
[39:56] and the same thing I think comes with uh
[40:00] you know like living in financial system
[40:05] or I don't know how to put it like in in
[40:07] a world where basically some crazy
[40:11] Authority would not sort of limit you
[40:14] you know your creativity your you know
[40:19] ability to move places um your ability
[40:22] to transact in a way uh your ability to
[40:26] you know uh hold assets that that you
[40:28] want um so sorry maybe I'm saying super
[40:33] vaguely from all kind of perspectives
[40:35] but uh yeah I would say I would wrap it
[40:38] up as a as a freedom as you know my sort
[40:40] of ability to do as I
[40:42] will um and yeah enjoy enjoy life the
[40:47] way you know it should be I guess I love
[40:50] that and the second part of that is uh
[40:52] is I want to have uh bitco learn from
[40:56] each other and that's why I'm asking
[40:58] what are you currently learning or
[41:01] diving deep into besides Bitcoin like
[41:03] besides Bitcoin what are you what is
[41:06] your passion what is your deep learning
[41:08] whatever Direction you want to go uh
[41:10] into uh besides pitco what you doing
[41:12] right so so my two Main Hobbies besides
[41:15] Bitcoin is like climbing uh flying the
[41:18] par glider CH like uh and Jazz uh as a
[41:23] you know learning Jazz basically cuz
[41:24] it's like never ending thing it's like
[41:26] there's so much much you can learn and
[41:28] you have to if you want to play a band
[41:29] and be able to improvise and stuff so
[41:32] those are probably like those those two
[41:35] yeah instruments and sports are usually
[41:37] coming up yeah yeah I love it and also
[41:40] especially in sports I also love like
[41:42] Endurance Sports in terms of like you
[41:45] know to be able to like cover great
[41:47] distances I love like this like um
[41:50] running in the mountains and stuff so
[41:53] and again I feel so free when I can do
[41:55] that right like uh so so I totally
[41:58] totally love it and I also kind of like
[42:00] this um the sort of athletic approach to
[42:04] it where you kind of have
[42:06] to you know make sure that you are like
[42:08] training well eating well uh Etc so I
[42:11] kind of like this sort of systematic uh
[42:13] approach I'm too I'm not too crazy about
[42:15] it I just like you know basically
[42:17] getting better every time I like to
[42:19] improve in everything I do so that's the
[42:21] way I think about it amazing and we have
[42:23] end routine uh and I unfortunately uh
[42:27] forgot or I didn't get the chance to ask
[42:30] sailor uh because we have an end routine
[42:33] um where the previous guest is asking a
[42:34] question for the next guest oh okay but
[42:36] I did not get the chance to ask
[42:39] questions so I will just give you the
[42:41] same endro te question that Michel sa
[42:44] actually got and he got the
[42:46] question what are you current what do
[42:49] you currently have that you really
[42:51] cherish and really like that you could
[42:53] not buy with
[42:56] money yeah like the main honestly that
[42:59] first that comes to mind I know it's
[43:01] like super lame I guess but it's health
[43:04] I mean and I'm KN on wood but I had
[43:07] actually a huge paragliding crash in and
[43:11] like end of last year I mean I have like
[43:13] like uh my col brone is like there are
[43:15] screws there I have some broken ribs you
[43:18] know punctured like P motx and stuff so
[43:20] and I kind of realized you know like
[43:23] being to able to move well and you know
[43:25] it's not it's not given also I guess I'm
[43:28] also in an age unfortunately where I
[43:30] mean I have friends you know passed away
[43:34] um so you know I kind of also like like
[43:37] to travel I I mentioned before we talk
[43:39] you know I was in Peru I see like people
[43:42] working maybe much harder conditions um
[43:45] than than us right
[43:46] so they their sort of healthc care is
[43:49] probably not uh it's definitely not uh
[43:52] the same as as we have so so yeah I
[43:55] don't
[43:57] yeah I think it's quite important to be
[43:58] honest because it's really without this
[44:02] like you wouldn't do you couldn't be
[44:03] like a bitcoiner right like you couldn't
[44:06] do anything so yeah I think it's
[44:08] important I love it a lot the best
[44:10] analogy that I ever heard is like
[44:12] whatever wealth you have it's like a one
[44:14] in between and then there's like a lot
[44:15] of zeros afterwards and the one is the
[44:17] health you take it away you only have
[44:19] zeros you have nothing and it's exactly
[44:21] I love it a lot yeah um perfect then I
[44:24] usually ask like where can people find
[44:26] you where can people ask you questions
[44:28] where can people ask treasure questions
[44:30] where can people ask you directly uh
[44:32] questions when they have something uh on
[44:35] your month on right so I'm not a huge on
[44:37] social media but like um Instagram
[44:40] that's mainly like Mountain Ring
[44:42] Mountain ring uh photos um and sports uh
[44:46] Twitter that that's yeah there it's
[44:49] mainly like Bitcoin and and just are
[44:51] related but again I'm not not a huge D
[44:53] I'm not I don't post that much uh I
[44:54] should probably do more I think my PR
[44:57] colleagues would like to see
[44:59] that U so uh I'm on Linkin as well but
[45:04] again by the way linin it's like yeah as
[45:06] I heard like recently or read this this
[45:09] funny comment and and I actually liked
[45:10] it a lot the guy said like you know I I
[45:13] haven't been on a linin in a while and
[45:15] it's like one of the most successful uh
[45:17] Czech entrepreneurs and and he said like
[45:19] I haven't been on linin in a while but
[45:21] it's interesting how many super
[45:23] successful and amazing people there are
[45:25] and he said like everybody just
[45:27] basically boasting about thems and I was
[45:29] like yeah it's like totally right and I
[45:31] will from now on I just want to say you
[45:33] know all the stuff that I up every
[45:35] you know month or I will just say the
[45:37] stuff that I really really up so
[45:40] so yeah if you want to follow that all
[45:42] of all my fuckups then you can also find
[45:44] me on Linkin I love that approach really
[45:46] like that's that's really cool I love it
[45:48] a
[45:49] lot it's also funny how uh um like CEOs
[45:53] and and leaders of companies are
[45:55] basically like the you have to be kind
[45:57] of a personal brand these days and then
[45:59] be on stage be on the podcast be on that
[46:02] I mean I I love that that's gives me the
[46:05] opportunity to speak with so many great
[46:06] people and do so many good stuff but I
[46:09] love it how how it goes and yeah
[46:11] LinkedIn I I don't do too much yeah
[46:15] yeah in a way but like I guess
[46:18] all social medias are in some way yeah
[46:21] definitely uh perfect then yeah thank
[46:24] you for being on and thank you for
