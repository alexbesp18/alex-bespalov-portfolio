[00:00] the timing couldn't be better for
[00:02] bitcoiners if country a adopts and
[00:04] Country B does not then country a
[00:06] emerges as a new world leader in country
[00:09] B does not those honeypots with the ETFs
[00:11] those are are targets of opportunity for
[00:13] confiscation running your own node and
[00:15] downloading the entire time chain all
[00:18] the way back to the Genesis block
[00:19] there's a benefit there for privacy
[00:21] there is something that can fix the
[00:23] money for the world one of the first
[00:24] steps is fixing housing affordability
[00:26] for the population you don't want to be
[00:28] in a situation where you've got your
[00:30] life savings in a
[00:31] house you are not not only a bitcoiner
[00:34] you are also an retired Air Force
[00:36] officer uh if understood it right yeah
[00:39] so I actually served 21 years in both
[00:42] the Air Force and the the US space force
[00:45] once that stood up oh really cool and
[00:48] then my first like kind of obvious
[00:50] question is because we always say like
[00:52] Bitcoin fixes this Bitcoin fixes that
[00:54] and we heard that saying a lot where
[00:57] like Bitcoin will end Wars like Bitcoin
[01:00] defund Wars what what's your take on
[01:02] this do you think that Bitcoin will end
[01:04] or like eliminate Wars you know it it's
[01:08] interesting because I was just listening
[01:10] to Robert Breedlove not too long ago and
[01:13] he he kind of touched on a similar topic
[01:15] and I think it definitely has the
[01:16] potential you know he had some numbers
[01:18] out there and I can't quote them off of
[01:21] the top of my head but over the course
[01:24] of the past 20 plus years the amount
[01:27] that the US has spent on on these
[01:30] forever Wars uh focused primarily on the
[01:33] Middle East is uh almost in effect the
[01:37] same amount that the US has printed
[01:41] dollars um and so when we look at
[01:44] Monetary debasement and how Bitcoin can
[01:48] fix that there is certainly the
[01:50] possibility that it could limit um
[01:53] conflicts and wars in the future or
[01:55] Bitcoin could um because of its scarcity
[01:58] and because of the proof of work
[01:59] required to
[02:00] uh create a new Bitcoin unlike with the
[02:03] fed and the treasury and their ability
[02:06] to print dollars out of thin air um so I
[02:09] think that the thesis is there the idea
[02:12] is certainly sound but what that really
[02:14] looks like in practice uh is is yet to
[02:17] be seen especially when we zoom out from
[02:19] another perspective and we look at it
[02:21] from like a
[02:22] 6102 um type of executive order for
[02:26] confiscation you know there's also and
[02:28] we can kind of get into this later
[02:30] there's a lot of concentration of
[02:32] Bitcoin in the US and in US based
[02:37] companies when we look at micro strategy
[02:39] or we look at coinbase who's custody the
[02:41] majority of the ETF the US spot Bitcoin
[02:43] ETFs um and so what effect does that
[02:46] have down the road as it relates to
[02:49] Future potential
[02:50] conflicts do you see this is like a tech
[02:53] Vector that uh the Bitcoin ETFs is kind
[02:55] like I had this discussion about exactly
[02:58] that I think three days ago where we
[03:00] said like uh kyc is like centralizing
[03:03] who has Bitcoin and how many does does
[03:07] those people have and then we also have
[03:08] like Bitcoin ETFs where the actual
[03:10] custody is extremely centralized with
[03:13] they all use kind of coinbase uh Bitcoin
[03:16] ETFs they like how many are there like
[03:18] 10 providers they're really big they can
[03:20] all like you can drive to the offices
[03:22] and shut them down basically and have an
[03:24] order executive order they have to
[03:26] comply and obey the the rules of the
[03:28] laws um how big big of a threat is that
[03:32] for
[03:33] overall uh Bitcoin or is it just a
[03:35] threat for people that have not their
[03:38] own
[03:39] keys I I think that the timing couldn't
[03:42] be better for bitcoiners um I could be
[03:46] wrong but for so like micro strategy
[03:49] Michael sailor just over 1% of the
[03:51] overall supply of 21 million and that
[03:53] doesn't take into account the potential
[03:55] lost Bitcoin that are out there you know
[03:57] estimates range between s and four 4
[04:00] million lost coins and so when I say
[04:03] that the timing couldn't be better I
[04:05] don't think that the ETFs are going to
[04:08] go drastically higher than 10% of the
[04:11] overall circulating Supply and so they
[04:14] may get to 2.1 million um in custody
[04:18] with coinbase or if it's Fidelity within
[04:21] their own self- custody and that's
[04:23] that's a benefit to bitcoiners
[04:25] especially if they are self- custody
[04:27] their own Bitcoin you know we use the
[04:29] term unconfiscatable or confiscation
[04:31] resistance in Bitcoin um those honeypots
[04:35] as I'll call them uh with the ETFs or
[04:38] held in publicly traded companies in the
[04:40] United States uh those are are targets
[04:43] of opportunity for confiscation but
[04:46] self- custody for people especially you
[04:49] know if they're robust in something like
[04:51] a multisig um those are going to be far
[04:53] more difficult to confiscate and I think
[04:56] you know we see something like that a
[04:59] confiscation the valuation of Bitcoin in
[05:02] in borders in the US border as well as
[05:04] uh around the globe is probably going to
[05:06] increase uh quite significantly from a
[05:09] valuation
[05:10] perspective I also see like I honestly I
[05:14] am right now not worried about
[05:17] confiscate like the government coming to
[05:20] confiscate confiscate my Bitcoin I'm in
[05:22] Austria I'm in the European Union uh
[05:24] they're doing a lot of weird things with
[05:26] Bitcoin they are doing a lot of weird
[05:28] laws uh are really trying hard to get
[05:31] the Innovation outside of the the
[05:34] European Union there's like this saying
[05:35] in the America there's innovation in
[05:37] China The Innovation gets copied and
[05:40] then the European Union tries to
[05:42] regulate the invation in Innovation
[05:44] outside of the that European Union uh I
[05:49] think the bigger threat for me and
[05:50] that's what I'm also protecting for
[05:52] especially because I'm outspoken
[05:54] bitcoiner um the attack Vector of
[05:58] individuals attacking me and trying to
[06:00] get to my Bitcoin uh if it's a Cyber
[06:03] attack if it's a personal actual like uh
[06:07] range attack in my house like this is
[06:09] the the bigger thing that I'm worried
[06:12] about uh than actually confiscation is
[06:15] that the is also that how you see it is
[06:17] like the personal attack the cyber crime
[06:21] attack basically the the bigger risk for
[06:24] individuals yeah and you know this will
[06:27] probably tie into later on in the
[06:30] conversation um but I think that looking
[06:33] at multiple attack vectors is a lot of
[06:35] what we did in the business of the
[06:37] military right and so you you kind of
[06:40] hit on it from a privacy perspective
[06:42] from a security perspective and from a
[06:44] physical perspective you highlighted all
[06:46] three of those um you know when you
[06:49] don't run your own node and you're
[06:51] checking you know mempool dospace any
[06:54] type of man in the- Middle attack could
[06:56] be collecting information and seeing
[06:57] which transactions you're looking at at
[06:59] which addresses you're looking at and
[07:01] they have a sense for hey what is the
[07:03] valuation that this particular
[07:04] individual might have because it's an
[07:07] open and transparent ledger so anybody
[07:08] can check it from a security perspective
[07:11] um cyber security perspective you're
[07:13] absolutely right too as somebody who's
[07:15] well who's outspoken you know the
[07:17] potential for fishing attacks and spear
[07:20] fishing attacks targeted specifically
[07:22] against you you know we see it on a
[07:23] regular basis that somebody Falls for an
[07:25] email introduce malware into their
[07:28] system uh and and then you know now
[07:30] they're collecting data on you hopefully
[07:33] at that point somebody is using you know
[07:35] air gapped Hardware wallet where the
[07:37] private Keys never actually leave the
[07:40] device and so that's that's not
[07:41] something that be can be collected on
[07:44] unfortunately in the shitcoin space we
[07:46] see it a lot uh with people collecting
[07:48] on you know metamask or trust wallet or
[07:51] whatever is the most popular wallet
[07:53] today I have no idea and and so I think
[07:56] evaluating multiples and then we didn't
[07:58] haven't talked about phys security yet
[08:00] but that's certainly one as well you
[08:02] know that $5 wrench attack is a massive
[08:04] concern and then how do you address each
[08:07] of those in your security stack for your
[08:10] own you know your own personal safety
[08:12] one of the things that uh I like to talk
[08:15] about quite a bit is multisig is telling
[08:18] people hey yeah I've got a large chunk
[08:21] of my stack in multisig geographically
[08:23] separated keys not on me so if you
[08:26] attack me um
[08:29] you could hit me on the head a thousand
[08:31] times and I I cannot give you the keys
[08:34] to that multi-sig stack and it's one of
[08:36] those things that I think people need to
[08:39] constantly be upgrading their security
[08:41] posture for that exact same reason yeah
[08:44] definitely and uh I also like I um one
[08:48] of my sponsors is like bitbox uh but uh
[08:52] like this is I see a lot of things there
[08:56] like for example most people still have
[08:59] have it on the exchange this is the
[09:01] first thing I try to hammer home and
[09:04] that's why I partnered up with like for
[09:06] me the most simplest uh uh Hardware
[09:10] wallet that there is and you can just
[09:11] like get your Bitcoin on there um but
[09:14] then in addition to that to just having
[09:16] one Hardware wallet a multi especially
[09:20] if you have to geographically uh
[09:22] distribute them so the attacker not only
[09:25] has to find you and get to you they also
[09:28] have to basically get with you over
[09:31] maybe even nation borders maybe to
[09:34] Securities maybe to other people maybe
[09:37] to Banks maybe to uh family members like
[09:40] there are so many possibilities you can
[09:41] do uh and I can guarantee you like uh
[09:45] the the more the Bitcoin is public and
[09:48] uh in there they probably have a really
[09:51] good setup going but the most people
[09:54] don't even get the first step like the
[09:57] the the getting the bit off exchange
[10:00] like this is I think the the hardest
[10:02] part once they have like an hardare B I
[10:04] feel like they getting more and more
[10:06] into this okay I have a harder wallet
[10:08] how do I keep be secure what's the pack
[10:10] of phrase where do I keep the pack of
[10:12] phrase then they get multi signature uh
[10:15] what do you have any like as you are
[10:17] having also background in cyber security
[10:20] uh can you give us like um like what
[10:23] what's your like um recommendation for
[10:27] like Bitcoin security but also like like
[10:29] in addition to bitcoin security what's
[10:31] like what what do you have like as
[10:34] common practices for cyber security in
[10:37] general because this is like the the
[10:38] most like you also have to keep your all
[10:40] things secure to have some
[10:42] recommendations here that you can share
[10:44] yeah yeah so I won't get into my
[10:47] personal um security posture obviously
[10:51] and I also think that um you know self-
[10:54] custody is is a bit of a journey I'm
[10:56] helping somebody right now um getting
[10:59] their Bitcoin off exchanges and you know
[11:02] it it's not significant yet and so I
[11:05] want to take him through the evolution
[11:07] more so to teach him so that he can
[11:11] orange bill other people down the road
[11:13] and really what that looks like is off
[11:14] of exchanges onto a hot wallet and then
[11:18] he's purchasing a hardware wallet and
[11:20] then we're also going to be talking
[11:21] about multisig um from there and then
[11:25] we've also got a process established for
[11:28] backup and Recovery
[11:29] and it it's it's kind of tedious but the
[11:32] way that I educate people is that you
[11:35] know once you have your Hardware wallet
[11:37] you know and and you can roll your own
[11:39] dice for your own entropy or you know
[11:42] use the ENT entropy built into the
[11:44] hardware wallet um but once you've
[11:46] secured that before you do any
[11:49] transactions we'll go through and
[11:50] document all of the words on paper and
[11:53] then we'll wipe the device and reload
[11:54] from the paper backup and then we'll go
[11:57] in and uh we'll recover and then we'll
[12:00] go into a receive address and sign a
[12:02] message and then we'll wipe the device
[12:04] again and and then reload from paper and
[12:07] then verify that we get the same hash
[12:08] from the same signed message uh once
[12:11] that's complete we'll actually back up
[12:13] to steel or metal and then recover from
[12:15] steel or metal to verify that there
[12:17] weren't any transcription errors and
[12:19] then once we're done there we burn the
[12:20] piece of paper and we have high
[12:21] confidence and then from this person's
[12:24] perspective um they've gone through the
[12:26] process three times of backup and
[12:28] Recovery so it's one of those things
[12:30] that I'm trying to build muscle memory
[12:32] into the processes so that they're
[12:34] comfortable with it and they don't
[12:35] necessarily need me standing next to
[12:37] them the entire time uh that's an
[12:40] amazing uh tip I think a lot of people
[12:42] get something out of that um you also
[12:44] mentioned running a Noe like I think if
[12:48] people get self- custody if people get
[12:51] uh that uh I think not a lot of
[12:54] bitcoiners I feel like run their own
[12:56] note um some have experence with that
[13:00] some have uh tinkered around with that
[13:02] but I think not a lot of people uh do
[13:04] that like maybe get into like why why do
[13:07] that even like what's the what's the
[13:08] process behind that yeah I I think it's
[13:11] really important for people to run nodes
[13:14] uh number one you're contributing to the
[13:16] decentralization of the network and then
[13:18] number two like we talked about before
[13:20] from a privacy perspective you know you
[13:23] can go to mempool dospace and check you
[13:26] know verify that a transaction got the
[13:28] one or the six
[13:30] confirmations but if somebody's
[13:31] listening in on that line they can now
[13:33] see the amount that was in that
[13:35] transaction running your own node and
[13:37] downloading the entire time chain all
[13:41] the way back to the Genesis block um it
[13:44] makes it a little bit more difficult for
[13:46] people to discern what your addresses
[13:48] are that you're checking right because
[13:50] you download the entire time chain but
[13:52] you're only checking specific ones
[13:54] internal to your network so like your
[13:56] ISP for example doesn't know that you're
[13:58] check address
[14:00] XYZ instead you downloaded address ABC
[14:04] thef all the way and so there's there's
[14:06] a benefit there for for privacy and then
[14:09] additionally for transmitting
[14:10] transactions you're not trusting uh an
[14:13] untrusted third party to be able to
[14:15] broadcast your transactions you're
[14:16] actually doing that from your own node
[14:18] so from a privacy perspective um I think
[14:20] it's it's very important for people to
[14:22] run their own nodes and then
[14:23] contribution to the network and
[14:25] contributions to the protocol are the
[14:27] the two reasons that I personally onun
[14:29] my own note yeah definitely you also uh
[14:32] you also mentioned time chain uh and
[14:35] it's now an interesting time uh to like
[14:38] talk about that because at the time of
[14:40] the recording we are like 50 blocks away
[14:42] from the fourth Bitcoin
[14:44] Haring uh when this comes out it's like
[14:47] a week later uh around that time so uh
[14:51] and it's interesting for me because I
[14:53] posted a meme with like 420 like Bitcoin
[14:56] will be the fourth on 420 but it depends
[14:59] on where you are on the world uh so this
[15:02] is like the first hurdle that kind of
[15:04] gets into the the time things uh do you
[15:07] see like what do you see the theory
[15:09] behind time chain playing out in the
[15:11] long run that we use Bitcoin as kind of
[15:14] time or do you see that as the time
[15:16] chain I I do see it as a Time chain
[15:19] because we are so early in adoption and
[15:22] we've seen you know hash rate go almost
[15:24] exponential it is kind of um not in line
[15:28] with how we as humans think about time
[15:30] you know whether it's the movement of
[15:33] the sun defines your day or if it's the
[15:35] ticks on a clock um you know it's
[15:38] ingrained into us I think genetically
[15:41] especially with um the impact the sun
[15:43] has on our well-being uh from a Bitcoin
[15:46] perspective it's it's a function of the
[15:49] difficulty adjustment and it's a
[15:51] function of uh you know blocks written
[15:53] to the time chain and so those two don't
[15:56] necessarily marry up with each other you
[15:58] know from genetic perspective of humans
[16:00] versus the technical difficulty of
[16:03] finding the correct hash for the next
[16:06] block um but I do think that from a
[16:09] zoomed out historical perspective the
[16:11] time chain has some some interesting
[16:13] opportunities where you can say you know
[16:16] this business was established on block
[16:18] you know
[16:20] 74563 or somebody might have an oper
[16:23] return um that is now written to the
[16:26] time chain and can never be changed
[16:28] again again so I think that there's a
[16:30] balance between the two and you know if
[16:32] we get to a point where we hit stability
[16:36] and hash rate isn't still going um you
[16:39] know exponential and blocks are hitting
[16:41] that Target of roughly every 10 minutes
[16:43] then I think we we get closer to the
[16:46] idea of a Time chain as it relates to
[16:48] you know genetic or biological
[16:51] time really cool it's it's it's so
[16:55] interesting for me the time chain
[16:57] because when you think of that uh like
[16:59] really long I think we cannot hit it in
[17:01] like the next 50 years because people
[17:03] are so used to that that time we having
[17:05] now but uh when you think really long
[17:07] term and you think of like oh when did I
[17:10] start my YouTube channel what block was
[17:12] there like when when did I went all in
[17:15] on bitcoin what block was there and you
[17:16] kind of start doing that and a lot of
[17:19] people as you said like when did I start
[17:21] my company when did I when when did this
[17:24] happen on what block and I think uh time
[17:27] J is I think I will find a guest that is
[17:30] uh the best for time chin I will make an
[17:32] episode completely around time chin
[17:35] because it's just the topic that I
[17:37] discussed with some guests a little bit
[17:39] but not in in detail and I would love to
[17:42] go really deep into that also it's an
[17:45] interesting conversation um as you uh uh
[17:49] discovered Bitcoin and I think we all
[17:52] discovered it uh uh differently I heard
[17:55] somewhere I think on a podcast or did I
[17:58] read about it from you uh that you the
[18:01] first contact with Bitcoin was like some
[18:03] illicit activity uh how did you get in
[18:05] first in contact with Bitcoin yeah so
[18:08] it's uh it's interesting with uh Twitter
[18:12] and you know we talk about time chain
[18:14] and granted Twitter is a centralized you
[18:16] know social media platform that can be
[18:18] changed and manipulated but I've got um
[18:21] two tweets from like 2011 and those are
[18:23] kind of like a Tim stamp for me in the
[18:25] first discovery of uh Bitcoin and it was
[18:30] directly associated with my work at the
[18:32] time in the military and illicit use on
[18:35] the dark web and at that point in my
[18:38] career in the military I really needed
[18:40] you know a security clearance and a
[18:42] background check and those two did not
[18:44] marry well together so I didn't touch
[18:46] Bitcoin for a long time and it wasn't
[18:48] until I was living in Europe in
[18:52] 2016 U when I kind of had another touch
[18:55] point with Bitcoin and really discovered
[18:56] it again unfortunately for for me and
[18:59] sometimes I wish that I had found
[19:00] Bitcoin even later but unfortunately for
[19:03] me that was you know the Ico era and you
[19:07]  coining at its peak and like most
[19:11] people during that time I bought Bitcoin
[19:14] and then later on exchanged it for
[19:16] something else to buy multiple shitcoins
[19:19] and learned some very expensive lessons
[19:21] along the way ultimately going back to
[19:23] the drawing board and then pivoting to
[19:25] bitcoin only yeah a lot of people make
[19:28] that that's switch like uh I think a lot
[19:31] of people are like um drawn into the
[19:33] idea of of of of altcoins of coins
[19:36] and then they grow up they become
[19:40] educated and then they pivot back like
[19:42] what was the the main like when you got
[19:44] got back on the drawing board what was
[19:45] the like the factor that you're like oh
[19:47] it's I was first right it's Bitcoin only
[19:50] not this
[19:51] conary yeah it was a little bit of going
[19:53] back to the drawing board you know um
[19:56] realizing the tokenomics of a lot of
[19:58] these other projects and their pre-sale
[20:02] their insiders their marketing their
[20:04] foundations it it started to appear just
[20:07] an extension of Fiat and not necessarily
[20:09] something that could revolutionize the
[20:11] world like Bitcoin could you know
[20:12] Bitcoin is the only project at least
[20:14] that I know of that has a completely um
[20:17] Fair issuance you know it's at the time
[20:20] of the Genesis block it had zero value
[20:22] and it was only valued through adoption
[20:25] and and we've seen you know the adoption
[20:27] curves of um something like the internet
[20:30] or smartphones and that's how those
[20:32] things gain value and that's one that's
[20:35] you know kind of the the foundation for
[20:37] Bitcoin and why I personally think
[20:39] Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[20:40] only amazing when when you think back of
[20:43] your studying Bitcoin uh what was like
[20:46] your your hardest part to overcome I
[20:48] think we we all have like beliefs that
[20:51] we have to overcome or like uh things
[20:53] that we just have to learn like what was
[20:56] with what did you struggle the most when
[20:58] learning about Bitcoin yeah well based
[21:01] on my background in it cyber security um
[21:04] the easiest part for me was actually the
[21:06] the technology I'm not super deep into
[21:09] the weeds I'm not a bit deaf by uh by
[21:12] any type of exaggeration uh brought from
[21:15] a high level of view I understood the
[21:17] technology relatively quickly the most
[21:20] difficult piece for me to wrap my head
[21:22] around um was the uh the Fiat system and
[21:28] understanding the Fiat system you know
[21:29] it's something that isn't taught in
[21:31] schools in the US and you know you go in
[21:35] and as you grow up you assume that um
[21:38] the government has to continue to print
[21:39] more money and you assume that you know
[21:42] the target of 2% inflation is a reality
[21:46] you know that's that's something that um
[21:49] is ingrained in us for so long that we
[21:51] think that's the way it is and it took a
[21:54] lot of study for me to really wrap my
[21:56] head around you know how does the
[21:58] economy work how does money work what
[22:00] does debasement mean how does the the
[22:02] government or the central banks do
[22:04] debasement those that was probably the
[22:06] most difficult for me to really
[22:09] understand and then once I got to that
[22:11] point I like we talked about earlier
[22:14] it's like wow Bitcoin can actually fix
[22:16] this because of its programmatic Supply
[22:19] its finite Supply its predefined
[22:21] issuance between now and 2140 roughly um
[22:26] there there is something that was
[22:28] invented Ed or discovered that can fix
[22:30] the money for the world that's
[22:33] that's I mean that's the most profound
[22:35] thing like fixing the money of the world
[22:38] like fixing the underlying asset fixing
[22:40] the the main base layer which also has a
[22:43] lot of consequen that uh up to the
[22:46] society but before we get into that um
[22:49] did you read uh Jason Lor's book
[22:52] probably right software yeah yeah I
[22:54] actually I found uh Jason Lowry probably
[22:58] on one of his podcast
[23:00] serieses um and it was it was probably
[23:02] Robert breedlove's series with him and
[23:05] so when the book came out I bought a
[23:07] copy and yeah I read it I think it's
[23:10] amazing I think the thesis is yet to be
[23:12] tested but I love what he's done in you
[23:16] know expanding the perspective of
[23:18] Bitcoin especially as an active duty
[23:21] military member in the space force
[23:24] because you know that that
[23:26] demographic um like i' mentioned in my
[23:29] past that demographic kind of has uh
[23:32] some preconceived notions on what
[23:34] Bitcoin is and you know for somebody in
[23:37] his position to be able to go counter to
[23:40] that perspective and start to educate
[23:41] people um in in a unique in a different
[23:44] way I think is something that all
[23:45] bitcoiners should do is continue to
[23:48] share you know the understanding of
[23:50] Bitcoin and grow knowledge around them
[23:52] and then that translates into more
[23:54] people learning and understanding
[23:56] Bitcoin do you see also that uh uh as he
[23:59] described in the book that Bitcoin has a
[24:01] role in Modern Warfare and Power
[24:04] Protection I think it potentially does
[24:07] um and that's why I said it's yet to be
[24:08] tested in I say potentially you know if
[24:11] we look at some of the conflicts um that
[24:13] are taking place right now on the
[24:15] geopolitical scale um the most recent
[24:18] one in fact um you know the the shooting
[24:23] of missiles back and forth between
[24:25] Israel and Iran specifically um I don't
[24:28] necessarily think Bitcoin um could
[24:31] resolve that um I think there's you know
[24:35] thousands of years of I ideological
[24:37] differences there differences of opinion
[24:40] uh it's not necessarily a land grab so
[24:43] one of the things that Jason Lowry talks
[24:44] about is you know property rights
[24:47] written on chain immutable cannot be
[24:50] changed um I don't necessarily see that
[24:53] as a direct correlation to a conflict
[24:55] when we look at it through the lens of
[24:57] Israel and Iran
[24:59] and so that's why I say it's it's yet to
[25:00] be tested you know there are other ones
[25:02] where it it could be um it could be
[25:05] applied you know when we look at like
[25:07] Russia and the Ukraine and a dispute on
[25:09] some of the land there um maybe it
[25:13] applies but again there's um there's
[25:16] cultural and ethnic um influences that
[25:21] the actors may not care what's written
[25:23] to the blockchain they they still
[25:26] believe that it belongs to them and they
[25:29] may be protecting the people that live
[25:31] in that
[25:32] region and and if it applies especially
[25:35] in that example now how would that work
[25:38] like how did just because it's like on
[25:40] bitcoin just because like we have a
[25:42] Bitcoin standard how does this affect
[25:44] anything if they just throw missiles
[25:47] around well I you know one of the things
[25:49] that he talks about is it's not actually
[25:52] the throwing of the missiles it's the IM
[25:55] immutable acknowledgement of ownership
[25:58] that is a deterrence that prevents
[26:01] conflict um kinetic conflict in the
[26:03] physical world and actually moves that
[26:05] conflict towards uh cyberspace and you
[26:09] know then it becomes you know the game
[26:11] theory of acquiring more Bitcoin and um
[26:15] acquiring more hash rate to be able to
[26:18] um influence you know your position and
[26:21] your standing within the time chain in
[26:24] the future and so again I I think it's
[26:28] interesting thesis um definitely worth
[26:31] sharing and considering but I'm not sure
[26:33] that it actually plays out that way uh
[26:36] in the future yeah interesting yeah you
[26:39] also mentioned that he played a big role
[26:42] in changing how people in the military
[26:45] and in the Air Force and space force
[26:48] think of uh Bitcoin um why did they
[26:52] think so badly about it like did did
[26:54] they think like it's what do they think
[26:56] about Bitcoin before it
[27:00] yeah
[27:01] so people in the military if they had
[27:04] exposure to Bitcoin in their service it
[27:07] was most likely um because of illicit
[27:10] use or it was used um on the dark web
[27:15] and I'll give a couple of uh fictitious
[27:18] examples let's say um number one would
[27:22] be
[27:24] um hypothetically the government wanted
[27:26] to acquire um something to be able to
[27:30] you use in an operation and it's
[27:33] something that you know if audited by
[27:36] the public would not be looked at
[27:40] positively and so Bitcoin could be used
[27:43] on the dark web to acquire such item and
[27:46] then that could be used for that
[27:47] particular operation right and I'm being
[27:49] ambiguous and I apologize for that um
[27:52] but I just don't want to go into too
[27:53] many details um and so there's the use
[27:57] of Bitcoin on the dark web uh for that
[28:00] reason the second one and I have zero
[28:02] experience with this but only heard from
[28:04] peers that um Bitcoin was used in the
[28:08] Middle East um as a form of payment to
[28:12] different actors in the region you know
[28:14] one of the things that we Tred to do is
[28:16] is keep uh money outside of um terrorist
[28:21] or suspected terrorist's hands and so
[28:23] utilizing something like Bitcoin um has
[28:27] been done in the past in those areas I
[28:29] told you a lot about 21 Bitcoin the best
[28:32] place for me to buy Bitcoin directly on
[28:35] a Bitcoin only exchange but now let's
[28:38] talk about how to secure your Bitcoin
[28:40] once you got Bitcoin you don't want to
[28:42] leave them on Exchange you want to take
[28:44] self custody you want to take
[28:47] responsibility of your own Bitcoin
[28:50] that's why I recommend getting a bitbox
[28:53] bitbox is an amazing wallet where you
[28:55] can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[28:58] simple way very secure you can even
[29:00] create a passphrase with that passphrase
[29:03] you can basically create a hidden wallet
[29:06] on the device itself make sure to buy
[29:10] your bitbox in the link down in the
[29:12] description and with code Robin you even
[29:14] get a 5% discount and it's it's
[29:17] interesting because um when we get down
[29:20] to this argumentation that oh because
[29:23] criminals use it then we have like to
[29:25] ban like basically everything because
[29:27] you can stab with
[29:28] uh people and then like oh let's let's
[29:30] ban all the knives uh so but I I can
[29:34] understand where it's coming from
[29:35] because then there's like something new
[29:36] coming up and uh a bad group of people
[29:40] use that new thing uh to avoid things
[29:43] that previously was not possible or not
[29:46] uh so easy possible of course you attack
[29:48] it of course you think badly about it
[29:50] it's also like I worked in cyber
[29:52] security uh and Bitcoin is always this
[29:55] thing like oh you have to get when you
[29:56] want to pay Ransom
[29:59] when you get hacked you have to pay
[30:00] random in Bitcoin uh that's uh that's
[30:03] that's the thing and nowadays the even
[30:06] encourage people to pay in Bitcoin and
[30:08] not something else because Bitcoin uh
[30:11] has a higher chance of than catching the
[30:12] criminals than when you have like some
[30:14] other Monero or something like that uh
[30:17] so there's an interesting development in
[30:19] that um the other question I had in my
[30:21] mind uh with with Game Theory we touched
[30:24] on it a little bit uh is is it a
[30:26] national security risk uh if if the USA
[30:30] or even other states don't adopt Bitcoin
[30:34] uh quick enough if they sleep on it too
[30:36] much yeah and that's one of the things
[30:39] that Jason Lowry talks about as well and
[30:41] from a a game theory perspective and
[30:43] like the prisoners dilemma um and we
[30:46] look at it from uh I think about El
[30:49] Salvador in this situation right they've
[30:51] adopted it as legal tender the the first
[30:54] and currently the only one that has that
[30:56] I know of um and you know if country a
[30:59] adopts and Country B does not and it
[31:01] actually becomes successful then country
[31:04] a emerges as a new world leader and
[31:07] Country B does not right and so I think
[31:10] that um if the game theory and the
[31:13] prisoners dilemma actually plays out
[31:15] eventually every country is going to
[31:17] hold Bitcoin um especially for the US I
[31:22] think it is it is a potential risk
[31:24] especially if we think if the US thinks
[31:27] that uh the dollar as the world Reserve
[31:29] currency is you know a national
[31:31] strategic imperative um then it's
[31:34] probably something that they would want
[31:35] to try to protect with them you know
[31:38] auctioning off Bitcoin that was
[31:39] confiscated during the Silk Road case uh
[31:43] it it appears that they haven't actually
[31:45] figured that out yet um and it where we
[31:49] are again where we are in the issuance
[31:50] cycle of you know 13.9 or no
[31:53] 19.3 uh million already mined um it's
[31:58] one of those things that actually could
[32:00] take place relatively quickly as
[32:03] potentially other countries start to
[32:05] adopt Bitcoin as a an alternative to the
[32:09] US dollar uh on their
[32:11] treasury what do you mean if relativ Fe
[32:14] quickly like is it like 50 years or more
[32:16] like five like of course it's really
[32:18] hard to pick a time like oh in five
[32:21] years time but relatively quickly it's
[32:23] like it can be like 100 years could be
[32:26] also considered quickly
[32:28] uh and thousand years because when you
[32:30] talk about history of money it's like
[32:31] the the time the time spans are quite
[32:35] massive yeah you know it's it's
[32:37] interesting because I was at bit block
[32:38] boom down in Dallas last week and I had
[32:40] the opportunity to meet Carino um who
[32:44] was very influential on immutable
[32:46] democracy and I talked to him about you
[32:49] know the global South Central and South
[32:51] America and the adoption from El
[32:54] Salvador and why other countries in that
[32:58] region have not also done the same um
[33:01] and I I told him a very similar or asked
[33:03] him a very similar question I said why
[33:06] uh why hasn't any other country done it
[33:09] um and what he told me was uh you need
[33:12] to lower your time
[33:13] preference and I love it because you
[33:15] know it's kind of a a bitcoiner response
[33:19] but he didn't just leave it at that from
[33:21] that point on he kind of explained his
[33:23] involvement in Guatemala in El Salvador
[33:28] and in Costa Rica I think um and how he
[33:33] is been working with with politicians
[33:36] local and at the the Government Federal
[33:39] level to be able to at least explore it
[33:42] more and go through the education uh for
[33:45] those people that don't understand
[33:46] Bitcoin and so for me to actually say
[33:49] what that looks like relatively quickly
[33:52] I think is on the order of
[33:54] decades um it it's certainly not you
[33:57] know weeks or months or even years um I
[34:01] have no idea but if I had to guess I
[34:03] would say it's on the order of decades
[34:04] and probably like 20 to 50 years out
[34:07] yeah it seems realistic uh in in in that
[34:10] sense uh because I mean now I have a
[34:13] wide wide variety of of guests on and
[34:17] they rate from like I think the most
[34:20] aggressive was like uh he thinks that
[34:22] the US dollar has probably a life
[34:24] between three to five years to live
[34:26] because we have such an amazing hyper
[34:28] inflation in next coming years which I
[34:31] find a little bit aggressive three to
[34:32] five years the timeline uh to people
[34:35] saying feat and the whole system will be
[34:38] around forever it will never go fully
[34:41] away governments will always issue their
[34:43] own currencies which I also don't agree
[34:46] with uh uh how do you see that like if
[34:48] we get to a point where it gets adopted
[34:51] um and Bitcoin is more and more used on
[34:54] also maybe like even States uh is you
[34:58] currencies that are packed like one to
[35:00] 20 on on bitcoin as a kind of like the
[35:04] old gold standard but now in Bitcoin uh
[35:06] where they forced you still to pay taxes
[35:09] with it how do you see that the the game
[35:11] theory playing out is do you have any
[35:13] theories about around that you know it's
[35:16] interesting um I think it was halny who
[35:20] mentioned early on on bitcoin talk about
[35:23] that there will be Bitcoin Banks um he
[35:27] didn't go into to further detail on
[35:29] whether that's at the country level um
[35:32] but I think that there needs to be
[35:35] Innovation at the layer 2 layer three
[35:38] area um in order to allow people to
[35:42] transact Bitcoin and Bitcoin only um if
[35:46] there is not sufficient Innovation um
[35:49] then I think we get to a place where
[35:53] countries are still issuing some form of
[35:56] currency that is p pegged against um
[35:59] pegged against Bitcoin um and the reason
[36:02] I I think that way is you know we know
[36:05] that um blocks are scarce and people
[36:11] cannot transact on the base layer I mean
[36:14] like eight billion people cannot
[36:15] transact on the base layer and lightning
[36:19] has the ability to um allow some of that
[36:23] but we need further innovation in the
[36:26] space um because of some of the
[36:27] shortfalls associated with lightning and
[36:30] then we also need to be able to make it
[36:34] um easier to use you know me living in
[36:37] the United States and having a very us
[36:40] Centric perspective it doesn't account
[36:43] for the other billions of people who
[36:46] might be downloading a lightning wallet
[36:48] that is not intuitive to them and so
[36:52] there needs to be work from a ux UI
[36:54] perspective to make it where it's easier
[36:57] to adopt uh for people all around the
[37:00] globe and I think the the important
[37:03] thing you to notice like we so early and
[37:06] this is this is something that we cannot
[37:08] say enough we are so early uh in money
[37:11] terms like 15 years is nothing uh we're
[37:15] talking about like 100 years and we we
[37:18] even like in the interesting phase where
[37:20] we have the internet Revolution where
[37:22] the tcpip protocol like it's there since
[37:25] the 70s or something like that uh and
[37:27] then then we have the Bitcoin protocol
[37:29] that's kind of built uh side by side
[37:32] with the Internet Protocol and I had
[37:34] like few episodes where we talked about
[37:36] which one is actually bigger what's the
[37:38] biggest Revolution and we came to that
[37:40] conclusion it's what a time to be alive
[37:41] to live through
[37:43] both and and see that uh thing playing
[37:46] out but we can to when we come to that
[37:49] where there are Bitcoin Banks there are
[37:52] kind of that Fiat system still uh around
[37:54] in like the next 100 years probably uh
[37:57] what's the most important or like the
[37:59] most exciting thing that Bitcoin fix as
[38:02] like the most interesting or the most
[38:04] important thing for you personally and
[38:07] your perspective what Bitcoin fixes in
[38:09] our world yeah again this is probably um
[38:14] a little bit of a US Centric perspective
[38:17] um but seeing housing affordability and
[38:20] its current impact on you know the
[38:22] younger generation than me um I think
[38:26] Bitcoin has potential to fix that and
[38:29] this is you know this is a line that a
[38:31] um Jeff boo says you know products will
[38:34] go down to the marginal cost of
[38:36] production and they will go down to the
[38:38] utility cost and we see that as that is
[38:41] so far inflated in residential real
[38:44] estate you know we've got outside
[38:46] investors whether they're based out of
[38:48] the US or um foreign investors buying up
[38:51] houses buying up Apartments increasing
[38:54] rents um because they want that
[38:56] particular proper property or their
[38:58] portfolio of properties to grow in value
[39:01] they use it as a store of value um for
[39:04] their dollar against you know deflating
[39:07] or you know reduce purchasing power in
[39:09] the dollar and so they store it in real
[39:11] estate and what that really does is it
[39:14] forces the people to work longer and
[39:16] harder to be able to afford a place to
[39:18] live and so I think that's probably one
[39:20] of the first things that we'll start to
[39:22] see in Bitcoin fixes and that's really
[39:24] repricing real estate as yeah people
[39:28] start to adopt Bitcoin and they utilize
[39:31] Bitcoin as their store of value versus
[39:33] Real
[39:34] Estate um I think that drives down the
[39:37] cost makes housing more affordable and
[39:40] allows you know that the younger
[39:41] generation to be able to buy their first
[39:43] house um you know my parents Generation
[39:47] Um they could afford a house and you
[39:51] know a comfortable living on one salary
[39:54] to try to do that today in the US is
[39:58] impossible you know there there many
[40:00] examples of you know families or couples
[40:03] with two income streams and maybe two
[40:05] incs and a side hustle and they still
[40:07] can't afford you know a house for their
[40:09] entire family and so Bitcoin I think
[40:12] that's one of the big the one of the
[40:13] first steps is fixing housing
[40:15] affordability for the
[40:17] population and we see it already playing
[40:20] out right when you see the house prices
[40:22] in the last 5 to 10 years measured in
[40:25] Bitcoin uh then they're Crashing Down
[40:27] like uh people say to me because the the
[40:31] thing that is in in in America is also
[40:33] in Austria I think it's a I don't know
[40:36] about all of the world but probably most
[40:38] of the world has the problem that
[40:39] housing gets uh really high in prices
[40:42] and is not affordable and uh the thing
[40:44] here in Austria is like people use it as
[40:46] their personal savings account almost
[40:49] every family they can could afford it
[40:51] bought a house uh that they are also
[40:53] living in and they treat it as their
[40:55] life savings account and they have that
[40:57] a credit which is like 10 20 30 years
[41:00] and they pay it off while they're
[41:02] working and the plan is to like live in
[41:04] that house uh and have then a pension
[41:07] from the government when you're are 60
[41:09] 70 years old uh so this mistreatment of
[41:13] uh real estate property as your personal
[41:15] savings account uh obviously drives up
[41:19] the prices in Norm uh tremendously uh
[41:23] which then yeah is is just a a Bad Thing
[41:27] uh for misusing it as a store of value
[41:29] uh I I think your example though is a
[41:32] bit of a fair example you know when
[41:35] that's uh where people live that's the
[41:37] utility
[41:38] cost what I have heartburn with is when
[41:43] you know an investor might have multiple
[41:46] or tens or hundreds of properties and
[41:49] you know they're increasing the rents to
[41:51] drive up the valuation of that property
[41:54] um for their own benefit right you you
[41:57] know let like let's say somebody has a
[41:59] portfolio of 10 houses and you know
[42:01] they're on a one-year lease and every
[42:03] year they increase the rent and that's
[42:06] in an effort to number one increase cash
[42:08] flow number two to increase the
[42:09] valuation of that particular property
[42:12] that is not the utility value of that
[42:14] property and what they've done is
[42:16] they've priced out all of these young
[42:17] families from ever being able to afford
[42:20] it and so I think there's a there's a
[42:22] Delta there the utility value is uh is
[42:26] where I think residential real estate
[42:28] should be um but it's it's so far
[42:30] inflated because of you know Real Estate
[42:32] Investors like I said whether they're
[42:35] domestic or you know their foreign
[42:36] investors that have continued to drive
[42:38] up the prices and we see that a lot in
[42:40] locations that are what we'll call Prime
[42:43] real estate you know Hawaii or San
[42:46] Francisco LA New York somewhere along a
[42:49] beach those are the areas where um
[42:52] prices have inflated the
[42:54] most and it's a it's a fair point
[42:56] because when you have just a place to
[42:58] live in it's like utility value uh but
[43:01] they have to put the life savings in
[43:03] there because all the other factors Dr
[43:05] up the the prices so much so then of
[43:08] obviously it gets to a place I mean I'm
[43:12] against the idea that you put your life
[43:15] savings in a house like all of your life
[43:18] savings is just in one house um like
[43:21] housing should be so affordable that not
[43:23] all your life savings like all you
[43:25] worked for the whole life is in in that
[43:28] one house uh but uh obviously when you
[43:31] just buy a house as a young family uh
[43:33] that's uh that's totally failure yeah
[43:36] yeah and and I agree with that um when
[43:39] somebody's in a situation where they're
[43:41] putting their entire life savings uh in
[43:43] a house to be able to afford it at the
[43:45] utility cost there's a lot of risk
[43:47] associated with that and you know
[43:49] bitcoiners we we evaluate risk quite
[43:53] often you know whether that's you know a
[43:55] natural disaster um is one of the most
[43:58] likely ones um you know you don't want
[44:00] to be in a situation where you've got
[44:02] your life savings in a house and it gets
[44:04] hit by a hurricane or a tornado um you
[44:07] want to be able to have your store value
[44:10] um in something that is is not at risk
[44:13] from a natural disaster for example and
[44:16] that that's something for me is is
[44:18] Bitcoin you know Bitcoin doesn't care
[44:21] about a hurricane Bitcoin doesn't care
[44:22] about a tornado um as long as there's
[44:25] electricity and an internet connection
[44:26] and ational power Bitcoin doesn't care
[44:30] and uh like there's no attack factor to
[44:32] it it's really interesting um how did
[44:35] actually uh going back to your stories
[44:37] how did actually your uh surroundings
[44:39] especially in the military uh I don't
[44:41] know if you were also like that like
[44:44] with me when I first discovered Bitcoin
[44:46] I was talking constantly about it now
[44:48] I'm switching to a more passive and more
[44:51] defensive uh kind of a state where I'm
[44:53] only talking about Bitcoin if uh if
[44:55] someone actually brings it up and is
[44:56] curious about my opinion on it uh but in
[44:59] the beginnings I think most bitcoiners
[45:01] like they want to talk about Bitcoin how
[45:02] did your surroundings in the military in
[45:05] in their family and and stuff like that
[45:07] uh react to to that yeah my my journey
[45:12] was actually almost the complete
[45:13] opposite
[45:15] um I was a a lone wolf in in Bitcoin for
[45:20] a long time I was a lone wolf and a
[45:22] consumer let's put it that way um I
[45:24] didn't talk about Bitcoin with my
[45:26] co-workers
[45:28] um for years yeah I I talked to my
[45:33] family about it but for the most part it
[45:35] was just me on a Bitcoin Journey um
[45:38] reading books reading blogs reading
[45:40] podcast or watching podcasts um and it
[45:43] wasn't until I actually finally
[45:46] transitioned out of the military that I
[45:48] started to be a lot more outspoken and a
[45:51] lot more public about my interest in
[45:54] Bitcoin um because uh
[45:57] and the reason is and I mentioned it
[45:58] before is because I still needed you
[46:00] know that background check to pass and I
[46:02] still needed that security clearance for
[46:04] my job and you know some of the
[46:06] questions that are asked there is like
[46:07] hey do you have any foreign investments
[46:09] or do you own any properties um in
[46:12] foreign countries because that's that
[46:14] along with many other things are going
[46:15] to influence you know how you pass that
[46:19] that backgrounded security check and
[46:22] Bitcoin especially at its early days was
[46:25] one of those things that um was quite
[46:27] frowned upon on owning because then the
[46:30] question started to come up oh you own
[46:31] Bitcoin what are you buying on the dark
[46:33] web and and so for a long time I was I
[46:37] was a lone wolf and quiet and just you
[46:39] know consumed information as much as I
[46:41] could and it wasn't until late last year
[46:44] that I started to be um a lot more
[46:46] public and a lot more vocal of my
[46:48] interest and passion in Bitcoin and this
[46:51] is also where uh we have to strigle
[46:54] effects like right when when there is
[46:56] more public in Bitcoin uh then it gets
[46:59] more legitimized uh Bitcoin ETFs coming
[47:02] out stuff like that and then all of the
[47:04] sudden people that were not happy to
[47:06] talk about Bitcoin before then all of
[47:08] the sudden they like oh I I feel more
[47:10] comfortable now talking about Bitcoin
[47:12] because people don't assume that I'm
[47:14] some someone buying something on the
[47:16] dark web which was kind of the case way
[47:19] back in the day so like uh this has a
[47:22] lot of positive effects and it's um we
[47:25] always saying like in in a AUST that
[47:27] Bitcoin is now ready for the restaurants
[47:31] uh like you can uh go on your get
[47:33] togethers on your weekly get togethers
[47:35] and you can talk about Bitcoin it's a
[47:38] safe topic it's like uh you will not be
[47:42] uh ripped apart because you own Bitcoin
[47:43] it's like a a legitimate asset that you
[47:46] can own uh and this is something that
[47:49] happened in the last like five years
[47:51] this is like something that happened
[47:52] really fairly recently uh we can discuss
[47:55] it like the last eight years or the last
[47:57] three years was the major part but this
[48:00] this is something that I'm quite happy
[48:02] about uh because it's started when I was
[48:05] getting into the in in in 2020 like four
[48:08] years ago uh and it's already was quite
[48:11] good back then uh when I talk with
[48:13] bitcoiners especially also in my area in
[48:15] Austria they like in that since 2012 was
[48:19] quite differently and yeah it's
[48:20] interesting to see the the personal
[48:22] stories of of that um you know it's it's
[48:25] interesting because we talked about it
[48:27] earlier and how early it is uh I'm still
[48:30] amazed at how early it is last year I
[48:33] gave a presentation at a cyber security
[48:36] conference and I I did it on all Bitcoin
[48:40] which which was kind of surprising that
[48:41] they even let me in the door but once
[48:43] they let me in the door then uh that's
[48:45] what I decided I was going to talk about
[48:47] and the number of bitcoiners that were
[48:51] in the room for the conference was way
[48:54] smaller than I would have expected you
[48:56] know I thought that people would have
[48:58] taken a similar path than like I did of
[49:01] you know understanding of the technology
[49:04] and the
[49:06] cryptography and hashing functions and
[49:08] it would be a natural transition for
[49:10] them but it was on the order of 2% of
[49:14] the people that attended were bitcoiners
[49:17] and I so I was surprised and it just
[49:18] reinforces my belief on how early we are
[49:21] still in Bitcoin yeah definitely if you
[49:24] want to be uh surrounded by a lot of
[49:26] Bitcoin is at a conference you have to
[49:28] go to a Bitcoin only conference like in
[49:30] in in America the the Nashville one is
[49:33] coming up in uh in Europe there's
[49:36] Bitcoin prag where I will also be I
[49:38] don't know if I will be in Nashville do
[49:40] you attend Bitcoin conferences like
[49:41] Nashville or Bitcoin Prague uh I would
[49:44] love to go to bitcoin Prague um you know
[49:47] I had an opportunity to talk to B deall
[49:50] not too long ago and you know his story
[49:54] of of Bitcoin Prague and with his
[49:57] daughter Samantha is just amazing and it
[49:59] sounds like the the energy and the
[50:01] conversations at Prague are slightly
[50:04] different um than the conversations we
[50:06] have here in the United States it seems
[50:08] like United States is a lot of focus on
[50:10] macro and economics and the focus at
[50:13] Prague is a lot more technical so I'd
[50:16] love to go but I haven't yet uh for me
[50:19] like i' mentioned I just got back from
[50:21] Dallas last week went to bit block boom
[50:24] that's one that Gary's hosted for the
[50:26] past seven Gary Leland's hosted for like
[50:28] the past seven years and then uh yeah
[50:31] I'm planning on trying to go to both
[50:33] Nashville and then Pacific Bitcoin uh in
[50:36] Los Angeles later this year but I've got
[50:39] to deconflict some schedules so those
[50:40] are both stilla maybe for me yeah
[50:43] Bitcoin prog uh for me it definitely
[50:45] must go um I was there last year and
[50:48] this is also I I was never in Nashville
[50:50] or Miami uh so I don't know the
[50:52] comparison but what I heard is like uh
[50:55] the the conferences in prag is way more
[50:57] focused on that Bitcoin only content
[50:59] it's also more focused on privacy and on
[51:02] uh on on on peerto peer and no KC and
[51:05] stuff like that it's more like really
[51:07] focus on that and yeah in America also
[51:10] heard the economics the macro is is more
[51:12] in the focus uh people also doesn't seem
[51:15] like that there's like this uh little
[51:18] bit of uh Al coiner still in that in in
[51:22] the conference I don't know how
[51:24] this how this works in the Bitcoin
[51:27] conference in in Miami or Nashville
[51:30] because I never was there really but I
[51:31] just like heard it so I encourage
[51:34] everybody to to be there in in Bitcoin
[51:36] prag and and and meet cool bitcoiners
[51:38] there um before we go to our end routine
[51:42] before we ended the podcast up um do you
[51:45] have uh something you're currently
[51:48] really passionate about so you're
[51:49] currently studying deeply uh besides
[51:52] Bitcoin is there something that you're
[51:53] are currently really passionate about
[51:56] yeah and I'm actually wearing the hat
[51:59] right now um and this kind of is is a
[52:01] good wrapup for the conversation so when
[52:03] I was at bit block boom last week um
[52:06] there was a group of US military
[52:08] veterans um veterans veteran adjacent
[52:12] people who all kind of met there from
[52:14] all around the country and so they've
[52:16] started this Bitcoin veteran group to
[52:18] really help spread the word within that
[52:20] community and I think that uh it really
[52:22] resonated with me and it resonates with
[52:24] a lot of other uh former military
[52:27] service members because it gives them an
[52:29] opportunity to uh find purpose you know
[52:33] unfortunately in the United States know
[52:36] we have this thing called 22 a day and
[52:39] unfortunately on average about 22
[52:41] service members uh will kill themselves
[52:44] or hurt themselves every single day um
[52:47] there's not a good single answer as to
[52:50] the reason why um but one of them is a
[52:53] loss of purpose right um you know you
[52:56] spent the majority of your adult life um
[53:00] in what you think is support and defense
[53:02] of the constitution in our way of life
[53:05] the further you go sometimes you might
[53:07] see some things that kind of challenge
[53:10] that perspective I know I know I did and
[53:13] so pivoting into Bitcoin um I I
[53:16] rediscovered purpose for me and it's
[53:19] it's actually like the most important
[53:21] thing I think the most important thing I
[53:23] can do in my life right now is to focus
[53:26] on bitcoin and focus on adoption and
[53:30] education because we are still so early
[53:32] and you know the the single digit or
[53:34] fraction of a digit percentage of
[53:36] adoption I think is is the most
[53:38] important thing and that's you know
[53:39] Finding purpose passion Direction and
[53:42] motivation and fortunately for me I
[53:44] found a group of guys and gals that have
[53:48] a a similar passion and that's through
[53:50] the Bitcoin veteran group and so I think
[53:52] that uh that's that's one of those
[53:53] things that um I most interested in
[53:57] right now is how can we conduct more
[54:00] Outreach to underserviced
[54:03] demographics um to share Bitcoin
[54:06] with yeah that's an amazing project I I
[54:09] love it uh and maybe we can uh if you
[54:12] come to bitcoin prog I would love to
[54:13] learn more about that it's really cool
[54:16] um for the endro te we have the endro te
[54:18] where the previous guest is asking a
[54:20] question for the next guest so like the
[54:21] previous guest asked a question for you
[54:24] uh without knowing who actually the next
[54:26] guest is uh which brings in a new factor
[54:29] of of of question uh the question for
[54:31] you is uh if there is one protocol
[54:34] change that you can just make and it's
[54:36] implemented in Bitcoin uh what would it
[54:40] be wow so I it is a tricky one so you
[54:44] know I said that I'm not a bit Dev um so
[54:47] I don't know that level of
[54:51] detail but I will say this that it would
[54:54] be nice if it made it more difficult to
[54:58] change the protocol you know one of the
[55:00] complaints about Bitcoin is that it's
[55:02] slow or it's difficult to make changes
[55:04] to the base layer uh I see that as as a
[55:07] feature not a bug right and and if there
[55:11] was a way to make it slightly more
[55:14] difficult so that there was more due
[55:16] diligence in the changes you know I hear
[55:19] discussions about the implementation of
[55:21] tap rot allows for um you know the the
[55:25] ordinal and inscription coinery on
[55:29] uh on bitcoin and that um if it had been
[55:34] a little bit more difficult to implement
[55:36] tap rot then maybe that would have been
[55:38] caught and prevented and so again I
[55:41] think that the uh difficulty in making
[55:45] changes to the base layer is a feature
[55:46] not a bug so why not make it slightly
[55:48] more difficult and that that'll be my my
[55:51] answer off the top of my
[55:53] head I think that's a great one uh
[55:55] making it more difficult and and making
[55:57] Bitcoin more solid because we have that
[56:01] amazing base layer if we think around
[56:03] too much we we could break it I don't
[56:06] think it will be broken but uh the more
[56:09] we think around with it the the higher
[56:11] the chances that we actually break
[56:13] something uh that we can actually maybe
[56:16] have had fixed in like an apple that's
[56:19] really interesting thank you for sharing
[56:20] your perspective thank you for for being
[56:22] on the podcast it was amazing to hear
[56:24] from UAC uh um Before I Let You Go is
[56:28] there uh where can people like get in
[56:31] touch with you when people want to ask
[56:32] your questions or is there anything you
[56:34] w to point d uh people to for like you
[56:38] want to promote your stuff for is there
[56:40] anything you want to share then the in
[56:43] the end of the podcast yeah yeah so uh
[56:46] thanks for the opportunity people can
[56:47] find me on Twitter X um we'll include
[56:51] maybe a link in the show notes um so
[56:54] they can find me on Twitter X and on
[56:57] LinkedIn and then for any active duty
[57:01] retired transitioned out military
[57:03] veterans uh check out uh Bitcoin
[57:06] veterans that's Bitcoin veterans. org uh
[57:08] to connect with some like-minded
[57:10] individuals and uh yeah I think that's
[57:13] that's probably uh the best way to to
[57:16] connect with with veterans who have a
[57:18] similar similar mindset and looking for
[57:20] something that could potentially give
[57:22] them purpose and you know for me it's
[57:24] where I found some some new purpose
[57:25] after leaving the military uh really
[57:28] cool uh thank you for sharing that and
[57:30] I'm looking forward to meeting you maybe
[57:33] one day at biton PR at bit BL Bloom uh
[57:35] maybe next time in person bye-bye yeah
[57:38] yeah thanks
