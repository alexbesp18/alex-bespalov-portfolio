[00:00] there was a flight with easy ched for
[00:01] 269 Bitcoin so at that point today it
[00:04] would be a it probably be an entire
[00:06] plane I could buy from that amount we
[00:08] have this indestructible base layer and
[00:10] every developer every company everybody
[00:14] can now compete on Layer Two for the
[00:16] best scaling Solutions we will have
[00:18] stuff like Bitcoin Banks because you
[00:19] know there will always be a part of
[00:21] society that just doesn't want to care
[00:23] about self custody even the haters even
[00:25] the people that talk bad about Bitcoin
[00:28] they are driving Bitcoin adoption is it
[00:30] a super cycle I've got to go out and
[00:32] say do you think is Bitcoin as a
[00:35] revolution as Bitcoin as an idea
[00:38] actually bigger than the idea of the
[00:40] revolution of of internet or is it just
[00:42] one of the parts in this digital
[00:45] Revolution what do you think of like the
[00:47] the size and the the the significance of
[00:51] the Bitcoin
[00:53] Revolution I would say it's a it's it's
[00:56] a very big part of the digital
[00:59] Revolution as you called it um is it
[01:02] bigger than the internet that's a very
[01:03] good question because we also have to
[01:05] break down the internet into different
[01:07] pieces
[01:09] um I would say so if the internet is the
[01:12] transmission of information and the
[01:14] protocol to transmit speech at least
[01:17] that's how I look at it Bitcoin
[01:19] definitely is the currency for it and I
[01:21] would say you need a currency for it to
[01:23] survive so I'm going to say it's a bit
[01:25] bigger than the internet just a tiny
[01:26] little bit yeah it's it's interesting
[01:29] this this thought experiment because you
[01:31] can make an argument that uh both is
[01:34] kind of interrelated because if you have
[01:36] the transmission of of information uh on
[01:39] the
[01:41] internet Bitcoin also does the same
[01:44] thing it's it's it's transferring
[01:46] information it's like how many uh Sates
[01:49] do you have how many Sates do I have and
[01:51] we can transfer those Sates around it's
[01:53] just information that we exchange in in
[01:55] the end of the day it's just a public
[01:56] Ledger uh and nothing more is is yeah so
[02:01] it's an interesting question to to go
[02:02] through but now let's let's start with
[02:05] with your journey like why uh do you
[02:07] work now for Bitcoin what drove you here
[02:11] how did you get into this whole
[02:14] thing uh it's a bit of a longer story uh
[02:17] but I'll try to keep it as simple as and
[02:20] short as possible so my background
[02:22] actually is in the media world media and
[02:25] specifically the tech world so I uh
[02:28] originally I wanted to become a banker
[02:31] um it also kind of aligns in within my
[02:33] family my mom used to be a banker she
[02:36] then went into um Consulting and in
[02:38] finance um my dad was more on the
[02:41] creative side of things he was an
[02:42] interior designer and uh he was more the
[02:44] artsy one in the family but there was
[02:46] always this clearcut of like hey you you
[02:48] kind of go into economics so I was very
[02:50] much interested but I wasn't interested
[02:52] in you know doing over leverage
[02:55] derivatives trades with um sick weirdos
[02:58] on Wall Street or or also family offices
[03:00] I was more interested uh in actually
[03:03] speaking to people getting to know the
[03:04] world seeing the world um and I should
[03:08] also quote that I used to since I was
[03:10] six I think uh used to play golf because
[03:13] there was a golf course right next to
[03:15] where we lived and uh I asked my mom
[03:18] during the summertime like I don't
[03:19] really want to you know stay with
[03:22] grandpa and grandma like can I go and
[03:23] play golf and she was like yeah and
[03:25] turned out I was quite good at it I went
[03:27] went into the Swiss national squad and
[03:29] you know all of these things and travel
[03:31] the world from a very young age on
[03:33] through the golf sport um luckily I got
[03:36] a lot of like scholarships and these
[03:37] things so it's also very privileged to
[03:39] see a lot at a young age and yeah doing
[03:43] that and sort of talking to the
[03:45] different cultures I was like I don't
[03:47] want to sit in a bank and you know uh
[03:49] basically defraud people out of their
[03:50] own money I want to I want to go out and
[03:52] see the world so I decided to study um
[03:56] media and economics it's a very specific
[03:59] way of basically saying I wanted to
[04:01] become a journalist and halfway through
[04:04] those studies I also started freelancing
[04:06] and you know this was in so I started
[04:08] freelancing in
[04:11] 2012 2013 and roughly around the same
[04:15] time there was a period where uh the um
[04:18] Occupy Wall Street protests happened in
[04:20] London I wanted to go and see those I
[04:22] was too young to book a flight because
[04:23] you still needed a parental advisor or a
[04:26] guide with you and I didn't really want
[04:28] to ask my parents if I could book a
[04:29] flight so I tried to look for Solutions
[04:32] how can I book literally how can I buy
[04:34] something anonymously online and the
[04:36] first link that popped up was a guardian
[04:38] article about uh Silk Road um no
[04:42] actually that's not true it was yeah it
[04:44] was about Silk Road it was sort of the
[04:46] earlier days of Silk Road there was this
[04:48] chat rumor going on that uh you know
[04:51] it's it's this weird thing uh I sent it
[04:53] to a friend he said yeah I use Bitcoin
[04:55] as well um he doesn't work anymore today
[04:58] he was a bit clever than I was and he
[05:00] told me listen if you show up with 280
[05:04] Swiss Franks I can show you where to buy
[05:06] a Bitcoin at an ATM and I know an other
[05:09] guy who's actually also going to these
[05:11] occupy protests and if you want I can
[05:13] ask him to join you so I don't have the
[05:15] issues with getting a flight I did that
[05:18] I bought the Bitcoin I installed the
[05:20] wallet uh that he recommended and I
[05:22] immediately sent those Bitcoins out uh
[05:24] for anyone interested it was a flight
[05:26] with easy chat for 269 Bitcoin so at
[05:29] that point
[05:30] today um it would be a it probably be an
[05:32] entire plane I could buy from that
[05:34] amount um and yeah from that point on I
[05:37] started using Bitcoin but really as a a
[05:40] tool to you know pay for stuff online
[05:42] because I didn't have a credit card back
[05:44] then the bank cards in Switzerland uh
[05:47] used to be nowhere near as digitalized
[05:50] as there are today so no debit cards or
[05:52] these things and uh yeah I wanted to you
[05:55] know buy stuff online and I wanted to
[05:56] use money online without basically
[05:58] asking for permission
[06:00] and uh did that for a couple of years I
[06:03] sort of stepped in and out of Bitcoin
[06:04] you know I didn't really keep up with it
[06:06] and then in 2017 I really got interested
[06:09] um also because I was covering a lot of
[06:11] consumer stories you know I was sitting
[06:14] on the floor in Brussels when Mark
[06:15] Zuckerberg announced that he's uh
[06:17] basically not spying on people when he
[06:19] was actually doing it and sort of all of
[06:21] that influence crept into me and then
[06:23] also exploring Bitcoin and going down
[06:25] the rabbit hole in um early 2017 I think
[06:28] it was also lead up to like the the the
[06:31] big bull run back then um and yeah sort
[06:34] of the first you know books and and
[06:36] things that came out where you were
[06:38] actually able to read upon Bitcoin and
[06:39] you didn't have to spend hours on the
[06:41] Bitcoin talk
[06:43] forum and you did not finish your
[06:45] studies no no no no I was a i it was
[06:48] actually a professor of mine who went
[06:51] you're earning as much as someone who's
[06:52] getting out of University with a
[06:54] master's degree at this point as a
[06:55] freelancer
[06:57] um you're young enough if you want go
[06:59] out and explore the world and I was like
[07:01] okay that's enough I have the approval
[07:03] from my professor he may have said
[07:04] something differently I can't remember
[07:05] it entirely but I told my parents like
[07:07] hey I don't want to do this anymore and
[07:09] uh you know he said worst case I can
[07:10] come back so that was sort of my take it
[07:12] out but I would need to finish uh I
[07:14] think two more sylvesters and then I at
[07:16] least had a bachelor and obviously for
[07:19] my opinion that's enough at that point
[07:21] do you see the the I think a lot of
[07:24] bitcoiners are actually homeschoolers
[07:26] and they try to teach their kids
[07:28] themselves they try to find alternative
[07:30] ways to to get education uh in the
[07:33] younger generation um do you see that
[07:36] the education system is bad is the
[07:39] education system uh not working uh did
[07:42] it work for you uh did you like feel
[07:45] like you you learned something that you
[07:46] can now use in like an actual life did
[07:49] it progress you or would you would you
[07:51] see like there's improvements here and
[07:54] there so I would say it's I mean this
[07:58] education system as a whole has its uh
[08:01] many issues let's call it um would I say
[08:05] it's failed I wouldn't say so I always
[08:07] had very good memories with school so I
[08:09] went to you know Public Schools up until
[08:11] 9th grade I think and then from that
[08:14] point on forward it was like a sports
[08:16] school where you basically did the um
[08:18] the uh matura which is the uh abitur or
[08:21] the uh it's probably a college degree in
[08:23] in britland and or in uh in the
[08:26] US and yeah I've always had very good
[08:29] memory very fun memories I also grew up
[08:31] in a very Multicultural uh School
[08:33] District so that was also very fun you
[08:35] know my my schoolmates were from
[08:37] Thailand and Sri Lanka and Albania
[08:40] Serbia these kind of things um some
[08:43] Germans as well so that was always very
[08:45] pleasant but in terms of what you
[08:46] learned in school no that was obviously
[08:49] you just wasted eight hours there and
[08:50] you tried to find different ways but I
[08:52] was a bit um I was always the kid that
[08:53] was daydreaming and you know um not
[08:55] really paying too much attention I was
[08:57] luckily good enough to to get the job
[08:59] done um I could have gotten it done a
[09:01] bit better probably if I would have
[09:02] focused but at this point I was already
[09:04] interested in the internet you know this
[09:06] this this whole new media world that was
[09:09] emerging back then so I didn't really I
[09:11] didn't really spend a lot of time um on
[09:13] the school bench as we say I love that
[09:16] you actually came exactly there where
[09:18] you actually wanted to be I think you
[09:19] said that you want to be a banker now
[09:21] you work for a company that's onboarding
[09:25] people uh into their own bank Bitcoin
[09:30] so like in a sense you could say that
[09:33] you are a banker but for that company
[09:35] you're making uh uh news things you're
[09:38] making journalist things you're making
[09:41] um a lot of things that you usually do
[09:43] when you're a journalist uh of course
[09:45] like would you say you are a journalist
[09:48] for
[09:50] Relay H it's a good question I mean my
[09:52] my official title is content manager and
[09:54] I kind of like this uh because it sounds
[09:56] a bit I mean I always make the joke if I
[09:57] reach out to journalists I I kind of say
[09:59] like you know oh I'm about the head of
[10:00] content cuz I'm the only guy that
[10:01] creates content so like I can say I'm
[10:03] the guy in charge
[10:06] um yeah
[10:12] but
[10:13] [Music]
[10:17] um
[10:22] okay um so yeah if I reach out to
[10:26] journalists it's I'm always makeing the
[10:27] joke that I'm head of content because I
[10:29] always say like oh you know within our
[10:31] marketing team we have loads of
[10:32] different positions filled which is true
[10:35] like our said does he also on your on
[10:36] social and those are lovely Graphics um
[10:40] and I sort of to the content side so
[10:41] it's not too far off but the title is
[10:43] content manager and um I'll stick to
[10:45] that more but it is a lot of
[10:47] journalistic approaches obviously um and
[10:50] uh more or less what I was doing anyway
[10:53] always had my phone always had a mic
[10:54] with me as a journalist so needed to
[10:56] record stuff as well and uh you know
[10:58] write stories that people read at the
[11:00] end of the day yeah and I also love your
[11:03] story with like you bought with your
[11:06] first what was a 200 300 Bitcoin a plane
[11:09] ticket
[11:11] which um leads me kind of to the next
[11:14] question uh which what what changes do
[11:16] you think will happen on a Bitcoin
[11:17] standard because when we have now
[11:19] bitcoiners and we have this really um I
[11:22] think everybody knows it in the Bitcoin
[11:24] Community with the 10,000 Bitcoin for
[11:26] two pizzas I think it was um so
[11:29] what do you think happens once we have
[11:31] adopted the Bitcoin standard now of
[11:33] course you spend crazy amounts of
[11:35] Bitcoin once you do anything like even
[11:37] now uh spending Bitcoin on something
[11:40] will uh be uh crazy to see in like 10 20
[11:44] years but if you see it uh when we
[11:47] already fully adopted Bitcoin and
[11:49] Bitcoin is not uh agreeing too much in
[11:51] value but still agreeing in in value
[11:54] because it's some money what do you
[11:55] think is the major change that we live
[11:57] through obviously we have lower time
[11:59] preference but what are the the the
[12:02] consequences uh you see happening and I
[12:05] also love like I saw for the first time
[12:07] ever in preparation of of this podcast
[12:10] your substack uh and lot your articles
[12:14] look through some of then and I think
[12:16] always like people that write a lot
[12:18] usually have really thoughtful things in
[12:20] their head because they actually thought
[12:22] about stuff before they wrote down so
[12:24] like what do you think is like ha a
[12:25] Bitcoin isation looking like the the
[12:27] world on a Bitcoin standard looking like
[12:29] like um what are the changes you you see
[12:31] on a Bitcoin
[12:33] standard I think I may have a little bit
[12:36] of a contrarian view there I don't see a
[12:39] entirely different world so I know a lot
[12:40] of bitcoiners go like you know it's
[12:42] going to be generational wealth like
[12:44] there will be no Wars and these things
[12:46] and then maybe this is a little bit of
[12:47] journalist at me where I I just tend to
[12:50] question a lot of stuff more um or just
[12:52] always be very supicious about what's
[12:54] going on and I definitely see a world
[12:57] where I think we will have stuff like
[12:59] Bitcoin Banks because you know there
[13:01] will always be a part of society that
[13:03] just doesn't want to care about self-
[13:05] custody of these things which is a shame
[13:07] I mean I work for a company where we
[13:08] engage in self- custody and we urge
[13:11] people to do this um but I think this is
[13:13] always a spectrum where people end up
[13:16] and at the first glance you go oh this
[13:19] is actually not good like another
[13:20] banking world but then you realize if
[13:23] everything is built on top of Bitcoin or
[13:24] if Bitcoin is the under um Ling
[13:27] asset the bank at least work with a
[13:30] healthy asset let's call it this way uh
[13:32] is it possible to reh hypothecate on
[13:34] bitcoin yes we've seen it with like the
[13:35] likes of FTX and these things but they
[13:38] got punished at the end of the day you
[13:40] know they don't exist anymore and
[13:43] knowing this and seeing what the
[13:45] possibilities are I think this gives me
[13:47] a bit more of a peace of mind um but I
[13:50] do see a future where we will have more
[13:53] possibilities I think to either you can
[13:56] call it monetizing online content uh
[13:58] through um you know false experiments
[14:00] like value for value or these things uh
[14:03] which I mean granted there are very
[14:05] early and it takes a lot of also mindset
[14:07] shift for people to adapt uh but the
[14:10] option is there and it's simpler for me
[14:12] to you know create a block and to
[14:14] monetize it and not going through the
[14:16] likes of stripe or PayPal or all of
[14:18] these annoying financial institutions
[14:21] that at the end of the day are just more
[14:23] cumbersome work for you uh and having a
[14:26] very simple setup so I see more World on
[14:28] these kind of things if everyone is
[14:30] going to lower their time preference
[14:32] this is actually an interesting thought
[14:35] experiment seeing how people live dayto
[14:37] day I would say maybe a little bit but
[14:40] not to the extreme extent as we see in
[14:42] the Bitcoin Community right now uh but
[14:45] you know who knows maybe also the
[14:47] community itself is going through a
[14:48] change there um so I think there will
[14:51] there will also be a little bit of that
[14:53] um okay I don't need to spend everything
[14:55] immediately or over consuming these
[14:57] things um but of course we'll always
[14:59] always have these um these hot spots and
[15:00] these Trends and things coming up but
[15:02] generally I think it's going to be a
[15:04] more simpler world where everyone can
[15:07] agree on something whether they do
[15:09] that's a different topic you know
[15:11] speaking of Wars previously but uh let's
[15:13] just be optimistic enough to say yeah it
[15:15] shouldn't happened although I think
[15:18] there is a possibility that it could
[15:19] happen yeah I think the the few that
[15:24] that a lot of people and a lot of
[15:25] bitcoiners have that we have Bitcoin and
[15:27] all of the sudden all the are fixed no
[15:30] because in the end of the day it's just
[15:31] money like if you're lazy as you
[15:34] still don't get anything of course if
[15:36] you're lazy as and you bought
[15:38] Bitcoin 2011 you bought it with a nice
[15:41] self cust resolution and now you have
[15:44] like thousands of Bitcoin on your side
[15:46] but but but this nothing Bitcoin did
[15:50] there for you you just were were lucky
[15:52] just lucky yeah so like this is like
[15:54] exceptions to it um in the end of the
[15:57] day it's still just money and people
[15:59] that are um and the thing that changes
[16:03] is you have everyone if everyone has
[16:07] Bitcoin as their default currency as the
[16:09] default uh money and then people have
[16:12] something they can rely on like if they
[16:14] work nicely they like can store it uh in
[16:18] Bitcoin and then they're like oh it
[16:20] agrees on value the focus gets shifted
[16:23] away from or I have to be a financial
[16:24] portfolio manager on the side I can just
[16:29] focus on my work what I do but you still
[16:31] have to do something like I also see
[16:33] this sometimes in the Bitcoin Community
[16:35] where I'm like oh I don't have to do so
[16:38] much low time preference I I can like
[16:41] like yes you can do that if you can
[16:43] afford that uh but just because we have
[16:45] low time preference doesn't mean you
[16:47] have to be
[16:48] lazy I I see this sometimes and it
[16:51] annoys me a little bit uh but uh there
[16:54] will be definitely I think changes
[16:56] coming with money we also see this in
[16:58] the history where uh money influences
[17:01] Society but I don't think it's like oh
[17:03] Bitcoin comes and all our problems are
[17:05] solved where people are coming together
[17:08] there are conflicts there are stuffs
[17:10] happening uh and yeah people will have
[17:12] have wars in in small families Wars but
[17:16] also in country Wars uh this will still
[17:19] happen uh and and even what you said
[17:22] with with social media with monetization
[17:25] uh it's interesting for me because um uh
[17:28] even on YouTube I have uh two channel
[17:30] members at the moment when this comes
[17:32] out maybe more um and they are giving me
[17:35] basically value for Value without
[17:37] Bitcoin like YouTube does not use the
[17:39] Bitcoin Network so I don't know if this
[17:42] even is a Bitcoin thing I think Bitcoin
[17:44] is more effective in streaming SS
[17:47] because bit YouTube takes a big cut and
[17:50] uh payment providers take a big cut but
[17:53] in the end of the day value for value
[17:56] and monetization of creators might be
[17:59] just changing uh uh on its own without
[18:03] Bitcoin playing its part all but saying
[18:07] with say saying with that with Bitcoin
[18:09] it will be more efficient because if I
[18:11] get from Fountain and I get from
[18:13] Fountain also streams and SS I get this
[18:17] 100% there's like no um IM immediate I
[18:21] think a small cut is with Fountain like
[18:23] a think they have a 5% fee yeah they
[18:25] have like a small fee but it's nothing
[18:28] compared to to YouTube I got uh with if
[18:31] you sent me a super thanks through
[18:33] YouTube that's a 10 uh Euro super thans
[18:37] I only get like five EUR from that
[18:40] that's a big cut that's not 5% that's
[18:44] 50% uh so that I think this uh just like
[18:48] quick Outlook from that um coming to
[18:51] that topic with lightning and you also
[18:53] wrote about lightning a lot extensively
[18:56] on on on your your substack uh do you
[18:59] see as Lightning the main layer two
[19:03] solution do you see a world where we can
[19:05] be on other layer twoos and lightning is
[19:07] not a thing uh how do you see the whole
[19:10] scaling of Bitcoin and coming onto like
[19:12] this payment layers and value for Value
[19:15] because value for Value will never be on
[19:17] a on the Bas layer of Bitcoin it would
[19:19] be too expensive to set some sets over
[19:23] how do you see this whole topic with
[19:24] lightning and scaling
[19:26] Bitcoin so if you would have asked me
[19:28] three months ago I would have gone like
[19:29] oh yeah it's definitely going to be the
[19:31] scaling solution because
[19:33] um actually you you dropped the f bump
[19:35] so now I know that I could swear as well
[19:37] which which might get Troublesome for
[19:38] you but um yeah you know I was lazy as
[19:42]  there to believe okay I've did my
[19:44] diligence on how lightning works and
[19:46] like understanding the the main um value
[19:49] proposition and like yeah it will just
[19:51] it will just function once you then
[19:53] actually spend more time looking at how
[19:55] these things work in detail and you have
[19:57] use cases
[19:59] you kind of go like hm interesting there
[20:02] are a lot of these holes uh that are
[20:05] just there whether there be in terms of
[20:07] you know not having solved certain
[20:08] technical difficulties or just just the
[20:11] way lightning works because it's
[20:12] complicated as and it's very hard
[20:14] to find good developers that actually
[20:16] understand it uh yeah they sort of
[20:19] changed my value proposition on it a bit
[20:21] as well in the last three months where
[20:23] I'm going I think it's still the it's
[20:27] the best idea to implement a solution
[20:29] like this that you know is on top of
[20:30] Bitcoin that settles
[20:32] instantly but whether it be the go-to
[20:35] solution the way lightning is built now
[20:37] I very much doubt this just because um
[20:41] if you want to run everything in the
[20:42] cell sh way on Lightning it gets very
[20:44] complicated quickly and um I think is
[20:48] not get mentioned a l very dangerous as
[20:50] well if you think about Force closer and
[20:52] stuff of channels um and yeah you then
[20:56] go into this world like okay because
[20:57] it's a scaling solution like can maybe
[20:58] trust a third party a bit more so we
[21:01] have providers and these things and this
[21:03] is where you then end up with a question
[21:05] in my head where I go how much
[21:07] decentralization do we need at every
[21:09] layer of Bitcoin I want full
[21:11] decentralization on the main layer but
[21:14] you know again with the thought
[21:15] principle of there will be Bitcoin banks
[21:17] in these things how much of that
[21:19] decentralization stays per per layer and
[21:22] so I look at lightning currently as I
[21:25] wouldn't say it's failed in a particular
[21:27] sense that you go like oh you know we
[21:29] should forget about it but it's been in
[21:31] beta for like the last six seven years
[21:33] at this point um we're in 2024 we could
[21:36] safely say it started getting momentum
[21:38] in 2018 2019 so six five years maybe um
[21:43] and there needs to be changes although
[21:45] I've been at a Meetup this week over
[21:46] here in Vienna and I really much spoke
[21:49] to a lot of the um the bolts exchange
[21:52] guys I don't of you know them they do
[21:53] the Liquid Lightning swaps and this was
[21:56] interesting again another scaling
[21:58] solution um more of a side chain with
[22:01] liquid but they could use lightning as
[22:03] as an integration tool and less than
[22:05] actually a main like layer where you
[22:07] build everything in so this sort of sent
[22:11] me down a rabbit hole where I went okay
[22:13] um I think the use case for lightning is
[22:16] there the Simplicity is well if I say
[22:18] Simplicity like it settles instantly and
[22:20] it's quick like this is this is the
[22:21] Simplicity I'm speaking about
[22:24] um but I think it will shift to being
[22:27] more of a transport protocol similar to
[22:30] the internet to
[22:32] tcpip and uh it will probably use a lot
[22:35] of its advantages to in the future
[22:38] potentially connect more scaling
[22:40] Solutions and um it will I think not be
[22:44] like the go-to thing where we get 8
[22:47] billion people on at the current rate
[22:49] there are a lot more smarter people out
[22:51] there than me uh that must definitely I
[22:52] mean I I produce content for a living
[22:54] out I don't code or anything so like you
[22:56] know there you go um I'm sure that they
[22:59] will find Solutions but I I see it more
[23:01] at a um sort of like a how could you
[23:05] say pivotal Point currently where it's
[23:07] either going to stay the way it is or it
[23:10] will adapt and I'm leaning more to the
[23:12] adapt side of things uh because
[23:14] lightning is so open and you can use it
[23:16] for many different things you can you
[23:18] know pretty much program it the way you
[23:19] want it to um I think we'll have
[23:22] different use cases there yeah I think
[23:24] the lightning has uh like the important
[23:28] the note here we have this
[23:30] indestructible base layer and every
[23:33] developer every company every uh
[23:36] everybody can now compete on Layer Two
[23:39] for the best scaling Solutions and this
[23:41] is the amazing thing because if
[23:43] lightning fails it does not matter like
[23:46] there will be something else on top of
[23:48] Bitcoin that will succeed at some point
[23:50] because we have this amazing uh uh
[23:53] indestructible base layer where
[23:54] everybody can just build on top of that
[23:57] and I heard so much about fed about
[23:59] liquid about lightning and I have kind
[24:02] of this view I don't know too much about
[24:04] the layer solution so I always try to
[24:07] ask people to to get more information on
[24:09] that side and I don't care too much
[24:12] about it because in the end of the day
[24:15] we have sound money we have Bitcoin and
[24:18] uh if it's true that it will also be
[24:21] sound money as medium of exchange and
[24:22] unit of account there will be
[24:26] uh models on top of that techniques on
[24:28] top of that layers on top of that
[24:30] because there is the incentive to do
[24:32] that and just because there's the
[24:34] incentive to do that um this is enough
[24:37] for for me to say like we have this
[24:39] layer and they will be built on top of
[24:42] that and maybe as an interesting
[24:45] experiment and conversation uh going
[24:48] forward you also have been to Salvador
[24:51] you also wrote about that uh and you
[24:53] probably used lightning there uh do you
[24:56] see how do you see the adoption they
[24:58] growing when when did you go to El
[25:00] Salvador was this like a few years ago
[25:02] or was it
[25:03] recently so um it was in November for
[25:06] the adopting early November and
[25:12] um how should I explain this I wouldn't
[25:15] so it's a bit of a mixed feeling you
[25:16] have there um from what I've heard uh
[25:19] when I spoke to people on the ground
[25:21] luckily I'm I'm fluent in Spanish so I
[25:23] was able to you know speak their
[25:24] language as well and get the the uh the
[25:26] proper feedback let's call it cuz I
[25:28] think there's always a language barrier
[25:29] if they maybe need to speak English or
[25:31] something and um you see an adoption in
[25:35] certain places like Bitcoin Beach you
[25:37] have Berlin and these kind of things but
[25:39] I also paid I think I've wrote about
[25:41] this in my blog post uh on the top
[25:43] almost at the top of a volcano to a BTC
[25:46] pay
[25:47] server and I asked the guy like why do
[25:49] you use BTC pay and he goes you know oh
[25:51] I started out with um the cha wallet or
[25:53] the the state sponsored wallet and they
[25:54] was and I started looking around
[25:57] then I just went down this rabbit hole
[25:58] um but generally speaking you had a lot
[26:00] of people you know using still custodial
[26:02] services but then again after spending
[26:04] two weeks there I realized that's okay
[26:06] because they don't have the luxury of
[26:08] doing proper self-
[26:10] custody and uh I mean imagine that you
[26:13] you living most of these people live in
[26:15] self-built houses if they're part of the
[26:17] lower class if you're part of the middle
[26:19] class you maybe live in like a normal
[26:21] house as we know it over here in Europe
[26:23] but it's very much tiny it has cold
[26:25] water H you know you're not you don't
[26:27] have the standards we have here and um
[26:30] yeah do you have the luxury to like run
[26:32] your own Noe to set up everything and to
[26:35] basically uh use Bitcoin in a fully
[26:38] self-served way very much unlikely they
[26:40] do have Amazon so I asked this like can
[26:42] you actually order their parts and stuff
[26:44] they i' like oh yeah that's not a
[26:45] problem um but obviously this is only
[26:47] possible to people who also have access
[26:48] to bank accounts um so there are two
[26:51] things that happened either way if they
[26:53] find Bitcoin they going to use a
[26:55] custodial because they maybe have 25 30
[26:58] bucks monthly in Bitcoin in that codal
[27:00] wallet and this is like everything to
[27:02] them so it's simple for them to set up
[27:04] and get going and you have great
[27:05] companies on the ground like galloy that
[27:07] actually also do a lot of
[27:09] Education or they use cash so I pretty
[27:12] much paid with cash or I paid um with
[27:15] lightning and actually one on train
[27:18] transaction it was my fault in the hotel
[27:20] because he didn't set the wallet to
[27:22] lightning at default so I spend a very
[27:25] very high fee on on my three9 in but I
[27:29] was okay he did a phenomenal job anyway
[27:31] and um yeah so this is the default state
[27:35] if you've been there though you do
[27:36] realize these people are not used to
[27:37] tourism they give 125% to make you happy
[27:42] you know to help you out um one point I
[27:45] even uh had an Uber that didn't find my
[27:47] place and the guy just basically drove
[27:49] me to the main city that's an hour
[27:51] strive for him he just did it because
[27:52] it's was like oh let me help you out um
[27:55] so they're very very open very nice
[27:57] people um they now don't live through
[27:59] these horror times they used to live
[28:01] before so the country is evolving but
[28:04] it's it's definitely nowhere near you
[28:06] know to a Bitcoin standard as we would
[28:08] think about it but having spoken to the
[28:10] people and again I've spoke to them in
[28:12] their native language so it it wasn't
[28:14] filtered or anything um they told me
[28:17] that you know um they have adoption they
[28:19] they see the value and uh also to those
[28:22] who had custodial Services when I
[28:24] explained to them that you can do self-
[28:25] custody they were aware of it um and
[28:28] they're just on their journey to it I
[28:29] think this is what we sometimes need to
[28:31] do better in the Bitcoin Community have
[28:33] a little bit of
[28:34] patience um have a little bit more time
[28:37] to give people these these uh these you
[28:40] know ups and downs we have all been
[28:42] through you know either losing money or
[28:43] like sending it to a wrong address or
[28:45] you know having to figure out how self-
[28:47] custody Works um so I think they'll get
[28:49] there um but it's great to see if you
[28:52] speak to these people you know they
[28:53] really they really like and they're
[28:55] proud of their country and that you come
[28:56] to El Salvador because of B Point that's
[28:58] also where they're super happy so that
[29:00] was very much uh cool to see and um yeah
[29:03] getting to use lightning almost at the
[29:05] top of a volcano was also was also an
[29:08] experience it's amazing I think uh salv
[29:11] can be such a good role model and I
[29:13] think this is also why so many
[29:15] bitcoiners and Bitcoin Maxes are coming
[29:18] there and trying to figure out how Sal
[29:22] can be better I think you like Max
[29:24] Kaiser and Stacy Herbert they uh getting
[29:27] uh the live there right now Lena s kind
[29:31] of moved there she's not not 100%
[29:34] settled but I think she she kind of
[29:35] settles down there and there are so many
[29:38] more uh that are going
[29:40] there to be fair I mean Max and Stacy
[29:43] can probably live wherever they want um
[29:46] yeah because um I am very much I'm not
[29:48] skeptical of them as you know um like oh
[29:51] they are like um Spooks or anything or
[29:53] you hear these crazy theories sometimes
[29:54] on bitcoin X um but you know in my
[29:57] opinion it's easier if you move into
[29:59] Bitcoin at a certain uh Pace or if you
[30:02] have the opportunities because you know
[30:04] you you had different advantages I mean
[30:06] Max used to work on Wall Street he then
[30:08] created his um weird trademark thing
[30:11] with like the actor stocks and things
[30:13] and he got on board very early with gold
[30:15] and he did he did realize what Bitcoin
[30:17] is at the dollar so Props to him um but
[30:20] I think they if if uh if if there's a
[30:22] better El Salvador popping up I'm sure
[30:24] they could also move there pretty
[30:25] quickly but it's good to see that they
[30:27] under that they understand that you need
[30:28] to be on the ground you need to support
[30:31] for my taste there's a bit of too much
[30:32] political sing um just again I don't
[30:36] trust politicians and and I don't really
[30:38] um I don't really want to know what goes
[30:40] on behind you know closed doors in these
[30:43] um offices or in these talks um
[30:45] everywhere around the world whether that
[30:46] be El Salvador the states or over here
[30:48] in Austria as you know we have a fair
[30:50] share of scandals here as well um but
[30:53] yeah it's it's cool to see that they're
[30:55] there and uh that they're also able to
[30:57] you know sort of Hold the Flag up for
[30:59] Bitcoin because um it is hard if if if
[31:02] you speak to people outside of our
[31:04] ecosystem and explain that El Salvador
[31:06] is going through a once in a lifetime
[31:08] change probably and I kind of go like
[31:10] yeah I don't care it's this country in
[31:11] Central America like okay they got a bit
[31:14] more tourism why should I and if you
[31:15] have people like Max who are very much
[31:17] loud and you know they can attract a lot
[31:19] of attention as well that at the end of
[31:21] the day is a net benefit for Bitcoin
[31:22] like most of the stuff the community
[31:24] does yeah I think everything uh kind of
[31:27] is on benefit for Bitcoin in the end of
[31:29] the day because even haters I had uh in
[31:32] jku in my University that I was for one
[31:36] whole
[31:37] semester did not do any uh any exams
[31:42] there also so I was not really in
[31:43] University but I heard some some
[31:45] lectures and there was one lecture uh
[31:48] and I don't want to call anyone out it
[31:50] was just a random lect lecture and the
[31:53] lecture was not about Bitcoin it was not
[31:55] about anything related to bitcoin but he
[31:58] always spent the first lecture talking
[32:01] about Bitcoin and talking bad about
[32:05] Bitcoin and this is interesting because
[32:07] he did not had any um reason to do that
[32:11] and I always take this example as a
[32:13] hater who uh drives Bitcoin adoption to
[32:17] the better because there will be uh
[32:20] students in that room they be like why
[32:22] is he talking about Bitcoin now let's
[32:25] let's uh search about Bitcoin on YouTube
[32:27] and then all of the they on a podcast
[32:29] and all of the sudden they're falling
[32:30] down that rabit because someone said
[32:32] something bad about Bitcoin so even the
[32:35] haters even the people that talk bad
[32:37] about Bitcoin they are driving Bitcoin
[32:40] adoption and so no matter if it's a
[32:43] Bitcoin Maxi like Max Kaiser or it's
[32:46] like a Bitcoin hater or everything in
[32:49] between there they're all driving
[32:50] Bitcoin adoption because they're talking
[32:52] about it the the worst thing that can
[32:54] happen to bitcoin that nobody cares
[32:56] about it that's the worst thing it can
[32:58] happen but I don't think it will happen
[33:01] yeah having worked a long time in the
[33:02] media and you know also still still
[33:04] engaging with it you know there's
[33:05] nothing as simple as bad or good PR
[33:08] everything is PR at this point you know
[33:10] so you accept the you just accept the
[33:12] fate and um I don't know this is
[33:14] something this is something with me
[33:16] personally and I have friends who also
[33:17] tell me this you know I can get into the
[33:20] angriest discussion with waiters or or
[33:23] um as I like to call them um Communists
[33:25] at bars over here in Vienna if they see
[33:27] a sticker on my laptop that shows uh you
[33:29] know
[33:30] Bitcoin and then that explained to me
[33:32] that it's an energy waste and then you
[33:34] know I just I'm basically a on
[33:37] purpose and I go but isn't using too
[33:39] much energy a good thing like shouldn't
[33:41] we use more energy and you know then
[33:43] there's the counterargument and I go
[33:44] into a question again and sort of I just
[33:46] start poking at people because I find it
[33:48] fun at this point and I do troll um but
[33:52] yeah at the end of the day it always
[33:53] ends up that they basically go okay I
[33:55] don't know the answer to this question
[33:57] and kind of go well how can you make an
[33:59] informed opinion about something you
[34:00] don't understand so uh I think if you
[34:03] always go to this journey whether they
[34:05] are going to convert to believe it
[34:07] Bitcoin or not it's like you say it
[34:09] attracts people and it uh either shows
[34:12] them the value prop of bit Bitcoin um or
[34:15] just how stupid people are and I think
[34:17] both both things are are a positive
[34:19] thing I I think you have to go to the
[34:22] fudo restaurant at some point in Vienna
[34:24] when I move there that will be fine yeah
[34:27] I mean
[34:28] we could go we could go into the uh six
[34:30] seven or eighth District you know
[34:31] they're they're kind of woke and you
[34:32] know they they're very much against
[34:34] Bitcoin there believe me I Tred to
[34:36] orange pill that's always fun but you
[34:38] know um yeah I'm sure if we if we cross
[34:41] a certain price point as we've always
[34:43] had in the bull runs um also these
[34:46] people will be at one point interested
[34:48] because at this point it then gets too
[34:49] good to be ignored and you may have to
[34:52] you know leave your very much high point
[34:55] of view and ethics of yourself behind to
[34:57] maybe I'll invest a little bit uh
[34:59] because most of them do they just don't
[35:01] admit 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from
[35:04] day one and did teach and preach self-
[35:07] custody this is my goto exchange when
[35:10] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[35:12] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[35:15] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[35:18] fees Plus at the same time support this
[35:21] podcast use code Robin and click the
[35:23] link in the description and it's also an
[35:26] interesting thing that's happening right
[35:27] now the prices of an alltime high or
[35:30] right around the alltime high depending
[35:32] on what the price is when the interview
[35:34] is coming out and what it is right now
[35:37] uh I mean it could have even be like at
[35:38] 100K because I'm the podcast is coming
[35:41] out in two three weeks let's see uh what
[35:44] happens um but I think the bus around
[35:47] Bitcoin is still low I think uh there's
[35:51] in the outside of the Bitcoin World
[35:52] nobody's talking about Bitcoin uh the
[35:56] people are not interested in it
[35:58] uh and this makes me really bullish
[36:00] because the price is still so high
[36:02] obviously it's because of the Bitcoin
[36:04] ETFs of the massive inflows uh do you
[36:07] see a major bull market coming do you
[36:10] see a major maybe super cycle coming
[36:13] this this one because we have the
[36:15] companies with Michael sailor and then
[36:18] more uh companies we have the fastp rule
[36:20] we have the ETFs we have so much things
[36:23] going on and the Haring is like one
[36:25] month away when this comes out the
[36:27] having is really close by uh
[36:30] so what do you see like uh happening in
[36:33] the next few years months so uh is it a
[36:38] super cycle I'm going to go out and say
[36:39] no because every time we have a new
[36:42] alltime high this is the first thing
[36:43] people speak of like oh the super cycle
[36:45] or you know we're going to I don't know
[36:47] insert crazy number here um so I don't
[36:49] think it is because what would be a
[36:52] super cycle you could look at Bitcoin
[36:54] from its Inception isn't it kind of
[36:56] already the super cycle like eating we
[36:58] spoke about the internet previously my
[37:00] first question uh it's growing massively
[37:03] faster than the internet has ever done
[37:04] to this point so you could argue this is
[37:07] super cycle in itself but I don't think
[37:09] we're going to it in terms of price
[37:13] um okay let's let's leave out if we go
[37:15] into like if we going to Nuke ourselves
[37:17] to death in the next coming years um
[37:19] because apparently our leaders just like
[37:21] to basically do this um if you look at
[37:25] it from a purely economical standpoint
[37:27] point we have a high interest rate
[37:30] environment by the way to all the fers
[37:32] who for some reason see this clip now uh
[37:34] Bitcoin did better in the high interest
[37:36] rate environment since it's since the
[37:39] fat and all of the ECB and stuff started
[37:41] to hike uh that it actually did in the
[37:43] low interest rate um obviously in the
[37:46] low interest rate it worked because of
[37:47] the money printing now it sort of
[37:49] decoupled and proved hey it we don't
[37:51] give a honeyb don't care really at
[37:53] this point if you increase the rates or
[37:55] if you decrease the rates but just from
[37:58] that standpoint on they have to decrease
[38:00] they have to print more money at one
[38:01] point we hear him say it all over the
[38:04] the news now um I mean even
[38:06] Christine lard should be in jail by this
[38:09] point for whatever fraud she's
[38:11] committing with the Euro and for
[38:12] whatever fraud she's been committed as
[38:14] she has committed in the past that she's
[38:16] also been convicted of as an IMF leader
[38:18] and in French politics um they all said
[38:22] we have to one point ease bring some
[38:24] ease and less pain into the system so if
[38:26] more quid money is available again and
[38:30] not just on the layer of central banks
[38:32] and Commercial Banks but it gets into
[38:34] let's call it the retail realm surely if
[38:38] we look at the past there must be some
[38:40] form of uh price increase again whether
[38:44] that is up to like these crazy numbers
[38:46] you here I think two days ago heard
[38:48] someone say um it's going to 600k in
[38:50] like couple of months or something um
[38:54] because this and that happened you know
[38:56] in last runs and stuff stuff uh I don't
[38:59] know I I have no idea where it's going I
[39:01] just know I think by the time this
[39:03] podcast comes out if again no third
[39:06] world war starts I think we're going to
[39:08] be higher in terms of Fiat uh
[39:10] denominated than what we are now um and
[39:14] yeah if if if everything continues the
[39:16] way they said that is going to do less
[39:19] rates and uh more money printing we
[39:22] should see um a higher alltime highs or
[39:26] or just czy numbers in the next coming
[39:28] months um but yeah you know we're all a
[39:32] now because the price is up and we're
[39:33] all we're all super hyped we we we'll
[39:36] see if that sticks up um I don't see a
[39:39] future where you should open a short
[39:40] position now like some influences do um
[39:44] but yeah just looking at these Basics
[39:46] you should say it should it should hold
[39:48] up and uh you know we can we can go for
[39:51] a few roller coaster rides upwards
[39:53] definitely and it's so so fascinating
[39:55] for me because everybody has a different
[39:57] the about the priz I had I just
[40:00] published the episode with Javan from
[40:03] the Bitcoin power law who tries to model
[40:06] the the Bitcoin price with the power law
[40:09] that's also happens in the nature and
[40:11] stuff like that really interesting
[40:13] episode I went over two hours within I
[40:15] think two hours and 10 minutes uh in the
[40:18] first three hours it seems that people
[40:21] are really crazy about that episode and
[40:22] really like it uh just from the
[40:25] statistics and he has this like in 10
[40:28] years in 20 33 we are at a million which
[40:31] seems actually really reasonable that
[40:34] this would bring us in this cycle to
[40:36] 250,000 something like that seems like a
[40:38] reasonable approach then there are
[40:41] people like Peter tanworth I just
[40:43] interviewed like two days ago no the
[40:45] last interview like actually the last
[40:47] interview before this episode The the
[40:49] episode is with Peter dunworth so he he
[40:52] is famous for saying that Bitcoin will
[40:55] go to 7 billion US per coin which is
[40:59] just an unbelievable number but it's
[41:02] also interesting how he thinks it and
[41:05] the interesting part is when you hear
[41:07] those people talk how they come to the
[41:09] price it's always um kind of logical but
[41:13] then you step out of of those things and
[41:15] you compare and you're like this doesn't
[41:18] make sense so I always wonder I always
[41:22] wondered this but like how much of it is
[41:23] also social media Cloud you know uh
[41:25] because we know what we need to say I
[41:26] mean if we both now open our mouths we
[41:28] add laser eyes and funny Graphics to a
[41:30] thumbnail you know it will instantly do
[41:32] better than um if we just do a normal
[41:33] thumbnail like these kind of rules apply
[41:36] um also in the Bitcoin community so I
[41:38] kind of wonder how much of it is cloud
[41:40] but um yeah you're right there is always
[41:42] a model or way for them to justify the
[41:46] price uh I can't remember who said it um
[41:48] but all of your models are broken is one
[41:51] of the more famous American bitcoiners
[41:54] who's quoting this on conferences as
[41:55] well so if I go by this is which I've
[41:57] seen enough now in a lot of bull runs
[42:00] maybe he's right maybe they're right you
[42:02] know I don't know at this point but I
[42:04] just know that over time because Bitcoin
[42:06] is disinflationary currently and it will
[42:09] be deflationary once the last Bitcoin is
[42:11] mined
[42:13] um my value that I hold in it now should
[42:17] be worth more in the future and that for
[42:19] me is enough to know um that yeah we're
[42:21] on the right track and that's why we
[42:23] just D in right because once we try to
[42:26] trade the market and time the market we
[42:29] getting in a territory where we just
[42:31] cannot do it like we we don't know what
[42:33] is happening and uh we only know that
[42:36] Bitcoin is sound money and will increase
[42:39] in value over time this is something I'm
[42:41] fairly certain about obviously things
[42:43] can happen obviously nothing is 100% but
[42:46] I'm young enough and I'm risk averse
[42:49] enough that I'm like I'm willing to bet
[42:51] on this that Bitcoin will grow to this
[42:53] levels and I think we will hit the 100K
[42:56] I think we will hit the one million I
[42:57] think we will hit also the 10 million
[42:59] Mark I just don't know why and I just
[43:02] don't know how no
[43:05] sorry when when I wanted to say this
[43:09] would be a good
[43:12] clip I know we're g there I just don't
[43:14] know why and how yeah yeah yeah but true
[43:18] you know it applies with all the W's
[43:20] like why should we go there I don't know
[43:22] how should we go there I don't know when
[43:24] I definitely don't know so like why
[43:25] should we care but yeah it probably you
[43:28] and I were roughly around the same age
[43:30] um I think we don't need to worry about
[43:32] it too much um I could see if I like had
[43:35] kids now and thank God I don't because I
[43:37] literally live off mate Red Bulls and
[43:39] and a few Sushi things in my fridge so
[43:41] I'm I'm not a good role model in that
[43:42] sense but if you do have these
[43:44] responsibilities I think you would look
[43:46] at it a bit differently but then again
[43:47] same rules apply right the value should
[43:50] increase over time and that should be
[43:51] good enough for you to know that you're
[43:53] on the right track maybe you don't YOLO
[43:55] into it like we do but you know life
[43:57] life is there to enjoy it right
[43:59] definitely definitely I have an
[44:01] interesting question for you do you self
[44:03] call would you would your self call
[44:04] yourself would you call yourself a
[44:07] Bitcoin
[44:09] maximalist uh no I would I I used to I
[44:11] used to call myself fun I also used to
[44:14] be very toxic um just because everyone
[44:16] used to be and you tried to be part of
[44:18] the cool gang um I would call myself
[44:21] more an optimist a Bitcoin Optimist this
[44:23] is why I always like to say an
[44:25] Enthusiast if you want to say some
[44:27] um but I do acknowledge the fact and I
[44:30] know a lot of toxic Maxis don't do this
[44:33] there is other out there namely
[44:36] stuff that will promote the cbdc
[44:38] infrastructure and the fat coins and
[44:39] these kind of things and they have
[44:42] certain value propositions that are more
[44:44] interesting to you know let's call it
[44:46] the banking world or the insurance world
[44:48] or just different businesses so I'm okay
[44:52] with that I don't mind I think uh all of
[44:54] these altcoins are a test that for
[44:56] Bitcoin anyway and we do see this with
[44:58] the most crazy like
[45:00] ordinals I don't have an interest in
[45:02] nfts I don't get art on the blockchain
[45:05] but Bitcoin nfts essentially Aid up the
[45:07] ETF at the um nftd markets on eth and
[45:10] Solana and all of these weird other
[45:12] tokens and they found the way into
[45:13] Bitcoin if this leads to
[45:15] hyperbitcoinization and these
[45:17] experiments are there um that's okay I
[45:20] think so um who am I to judge how people
[45:22] want to spend their money for these
[45:23] things but I would definitely not call
[45:25] myself a maximalist just because
[45:27] what is a maxim list you would you would
[45:29] probably only need to live on bitcoin
[45:31] and this means paying your rent your
[45:33] goods in Bitcoin at least from my
[45:34] understanding um I always like if Maxis
[45:37] call out people for having other assets
[45:39] like stocks or bonds and these kind of
[45:41] things but um you know they then invest
[45:43] into like stuff like tedar or usdc
[45:45] because you don't need a stable coin to
[45:47] buy your sets on an exchange um they
[45:50] obviously have Bitcoin and they probably
[45:51] also have Fiat because you still need to
[45:53] pay in Fiat for some stuff in your daily
[45:56] life unless you're willing to go routes
[45:58] um so just from that standpoint
[45:59] maximalist didn't fit anymore um and
[46:02] Optimist or enthusias is I'm saying
[46:04] Optimist in the community and Enthusiast
[46:06] with like my friends um because they
[46:08] know that I can be a if um if I
[46:10] start the argument so this is sort of
[46:12] the neutral way for me to go about it
[46:15] that's interesting because uh Michael
[46:17] saor made in madira the the presentation
[46:21] that he went from being an investor and
[46:23] he went for all the step and his last
[46:25] step was like I'm a Bitcoin maximalist
[46:28] but at the same time he says that he
[46:31] does not see necessarily Bitcoin
[46:33] becoming a media of exchange he uses the
[46:35] Fiat dollar but then also he says on on
[46:38] national TV that uh people that save in
[46:42] uh Fiat are poor people I think
[46:46] said something like that so I think
[46:49] Bitcoin maximalist like it's it's it's a
[46:52] term a lot of people scream about but
[46:55] everybody seems to have a little bit of
[46:57] a different definition in the end of the
[46:58] day I'm just caring about is this person
[47:01] a bitcoiner or not and Bitcoin has
[47:04] nothing to do with how many Bitcoin you
[47:06] have it has to do with the mindset uh do
[47:09] you are you a self- sovereign mindset
[47:11] are you mind uh mindset that has certain
[47:14] values and I even see people that have
[47:17] gold and and and stocks and real estate
[47:20] also in their portfolio as bitcoiner
[47:22] they are even bitcoiners with no Bitcoin
[47:24] because they don't they didn't
[47:25] understand Bitcoin till now but they the
[47:27] Bitcoin mindset and they will just need
[47:29] time to get to that mindset there a lot
[47:31] of people out there uh in that but uh
[47:36] yeah I mean I also you know I I'm also
[47:39] um um okay I only have I still have my
[47:42] stock portfolio because I was too lazy
[47:44] to figure out how to transfer it from uh
[47:47] one country to another you know with um
[47:48] you have sort of different models in all
[47:50] of these brokerage accounts luckily my
[47:53] brokerage allows me to basically
[47:55] transfer within them
[47:57] um but yeah I still have some tech
[47:59] stocks I still have some of these things
[48:00] you know from back in the day um they're
[48:03] doing at this point and ironically
[48:05] all of them hold large cash reserves uh
[48:08] and not a Bitcoin Treasury and yeah I
[48:11] also own micro strategy stocks because I
[48:13] do want to support their Bitcoin
[48:15] strategy and the vision that they share
[48:17] and it's sort of been the inofficial ETF
[48:19] anyway I also own some shares into the
[48:21] ETFs just because I thought you know uh
[48:24] sort of trying to help Wall Street out
[48:27] because you know it was it was a fun
[48:28] thing to do um and I I went to the Vanek
[48:31] ETFs because it had the hdle tier and I
[48:33] thought like yeah that's cool um and
[48:36] some shares into ibit but um this has
[48:38] like no connection to me the way it does
[48:41] if if I look at my proper Bitcoin stack
[48:44] so am I a maxi now or not I don't really
[48:48] care at that point but I think I keep
[48:50] the torch up high to to get as many
[48:51] people into Bitcoin and that's my goal
[48:53] behind it right not to I don't know not
[48:56] to be the 10,000 laser I guy on on
[48:58] social media sorry for anyone listening
[49:01] I hope you're I hope you're offended
[49:02] because that's the idea behind uh having
[49:04] an open discussion
[49:05] right that's that's really cool um and
[49:09] this brings me a little bit to the next
[49:11] topic and we talked about marketing we
[49:13] just talked about investing and for
[49:16] investing in marketing and for all it's
[49:19] working and we need startups we need
[49:21] companies that do stuff just as relay
[49:24] and Rel relay has VC money behind it and
[49:28] I think uh it's it's always interesting
[49:30] because we need more I think we need
[49:33] more VC money in Bitcoin I mean in
[49:36] Europe in general like I think we we
[49:39] when we see the capital uh flowing in
[49:41] America and then we see the capital
[49:43] flowing in Europe it's just uh really
[49:45] poor it's like we America way more
[49:48] Capital that's why the Bitcoin ETF is
[49:50] also a bigger thing when it's uh
[49:52] happened in America than when it
[49:53] happened in Canada or Europe uh so do do
[49:57] you see um also this thing where we
[49:59] don't have enough VC capital and do you
[50:02] see a way for Europe for Bitcoin to ACR
[50:06] more VC Capital just as I think Rea is
[50:09] quite successful actually as a Bitcoin
[50:10] company to get VC
[50:12] Capital so I think my answer is going to
[50:15] be in three parts first of all um this
[50:18] is a shout out to I think Manu runs the
[50:20] account from MV podcast uh he for some
[50:23] reason you know called us out a few days
[50:25] ago and I had to hold myself back at
[50:28] this point because you know uh we did we
[50:30] did the marketing team at relay like
[50:32] we're pretty much fluent aret is a
[50:33] social guy but if it's a German answer I
[50:36] sort of have to answer and then we were
[50:38] he attacked us there uh for having the
[50:40] audacity to accept VC money uh because
[50:43] somehow the VCS have an influence into
[50:45] company company decisions which is true
[50:47] at a certain point but you know um if
[50:50] you run a company under the guidance of
[50:52] venture capitalists who are also uh G
[50:56] basic basically at the whim of their
[50:58] liquidity partners and like the people
[51:00] that actually provide the money for them
[51:02] to invest you do realize that we all
[51:04] align on the same goal and with uh relay
[51:07] specifically now to quote us but also
[51:08] with other Bitcoin companies they have
[51:10] Bitcoin odcs or specific Tech VCS that
[51:14] understand the value prop of Bitcoin
[51:15] again saying value prop a lot of this
[51:18] podcast I apologize uh looking back at
[51:20] it now but um yeah to call these things
[51:23] out I just go this is silly because it's
[51:26] like you mentioned we have to go against
[51:28] America from a European standpoint we
[51:31] have to go against Tech I mean AI for
[51:35] example in my opinion does a lot of good
[51:38] but there's also a lot of crap that just
[51:40] you know wraps a chat gbt rapper and
[51:42] builds a shitty product and raises like
[51:44] a hundred million dollars or companies
[51:46] that are like 14 days old and they get a
[51:48] $4.5 billion evaluation like imag these
[51:51] kind of things we're way off from these
[51:54] numbers in Bitcoin maybe also bit
[51:57] because we kind of have this dickish
[51:59] attitude towards uh Venture Capital um
[52:02] so to have that thought experiment to go
[52:04] back to um my um shouting out there on
[52:08] the account I
[52:09] mentioned it doesn't help it doesn't
[52:11] help the ecosystem we need a short-term
[52:14] solution to basically grow as fast as we
[52:16] can even faster than what the Bitcoin
[52:18] network does already um so that's where
[52:20] you need this help that's why you get
[52:22] Venture Capital Money in and second part
[52:25] to your answer
[52:27] yes relay has been raising well but
[52:28] again compared to other tech companies
[52:31] um I bet they're laugh They're laughing
[52:33] at the amounts we raise because for us
[52:35] it's a lot of money right we can do a
[52:36] lot with it in the Bitcoin Community but
[52:38] again for tech companies and if you put
[52:40] it into perspective it's not a lot um so
[52:42] we need more of that we also need to be
[52:44] more proactive and the third part you
[52:46] mentioned Europe versus USA definitely I
[52:49] mean we have a lot of great venture
[52:51] capitalist um Family offices we have a
[52:54] lot of great uh Minds that you know had
[52:56] multiple exits and founded their own
[52:58] funds the issue is just our attitude
[53:01] towards investing as a whole I mean we
[53:03] are from the German speaking area of
[53:05] Europe and what is it that you learn at
[53:07] a young age you save you don't invest
[53:10] and if you're smart enough in the past
[53:12] before Bitcoin you were able to invest
[53:14] into hard assets like gold um again all
[53:17] of the Maxis it's a bit more than a pet
[53:19] Shiny Rock in my opinion because gold
[53:21] had its use cases and it still does if
[53:23] you look at how it's been used um but
[53:26] that's it like you didn't really you
[53:28] didn't go out on the limp and you risked
[53:30] stuff and Americans are just way more
[53:32] used to this maybe also with their whole
[53:34] history and the way things came about
[53:36] and out of that they already have a
[53:38] competitive Advantage because they're
[53:40] hungrier to get done to innovate
[53:43] new stuff and to go out there and we
[53:45] just lack a bit in that attitude there
[53:47] are certain countries in Europe that do
[53:49] it better than others obviously but we
[53:52] definitely need more of that money I
[53:54] also think we need more failure in
[53:56] Europe
[53:57] um I always see people um you know being
[53:58] scared that they get laid off or that
[54:00] the company fails and failure is a good
[54:02] thing you learn not what not to do right
[54:05] and ideally if like people don't kill
[54:07] themselves or if nothing major happens
[54:09] you'll eventually don't do the mistake
[54:11] again or if you do it again it's not
[54:13] going to be as big as you did it
[54:15] previously so you're constantly in that
[54:17] forward motion instead of staying uh
[54:20] passive um so yeah to
[54:23] recap shut shut the up if you're on
[54:25] social that you criticize people who
[54:27] take on the risk to building these
[54:29] products we need this help it needs to
[54:31] grow faster and uh capital from the
[54:33] outside is the fastest way of growing um
[54:36] whether that be a v VC fund a Bitcoin
[54:38] whale or you know just a crowd found you
[54:40] do you need this to get there secondly
[54:43] uh we need to get off our ass in Europe
[54:45] because we need to we need to catch up
[54:47] with the rest of the world and uh
[54:49] thirdly if we do it's okay to fail we
[54:52] just need to keep moving forward and I
[54:54] think if we combine all of that you will
[54:57] then in the future see the big
[54:59] investment rounds into Bitcoin companies
[55:01] um and uh yeah I can see a future where
[55:04] one of the Bitcoin only the companies
[55:05] specifically you know will be able to
[55:07] raise like quarter of a billion maybe
[55:09] half a billion because people will
[55:11] finally understand oh we shouldn't waste
[55:13] our time with like AI or um I don't know
[55:17] what's latest again people are BL into
[55:18] web three again because you know the the
[55:20] tokens they still hold in their wallet
[55:22] somehow are worth something now again so
[55:24] they invest money into it again instead
[55:26] of focusing or wasting time there uh
[55:29] they get into Bitcoin they potentially
[55:31] will write bigger checks and this is a
[55:32] good thing like we need this money to
[55:34] get there because eventually if
[55:35] everything leads to bitcoin right it
[55:37] doesn't matter if they give us Fiat now
[55:39] or later it will turn into Bitcoin
[55:42] anyway so uh why not use the opportunity
[55:44] and accept it to get there
[55:46] faster yeah and I don't know what the
[55:49] thing is bad about Venture Capital it's
[55:51] just people putting money in the company
[55:53] and of course they have influence like
[55:57] why should he not have uh and the same
[56:00] way as Julian as the CEO has influence
[56:03] over over relay the same way as everyone
[56:06] involved in the even you as a as an
[56:09] normal employee has influence over relay
[56:12] everyone involved in the ecosystem has
[56:14] of course influence over I can start a
[56:16] 51% attack with my shares no I'm just
[56:21] kidding like that's I think I think
[56:23] that's nothing bad I don't know what
[56:26] did not watch the episode I don't didn't
[56:29] watch his his argument but uh I I'm I'm
[56:33] I'm screaming about it that we need more
[56:35] capital in in in Bitcoin and Venture
[56:37] capitalists have a lot of capital uh and
[56:39] if they deploy it to bitcoin instead of
[56:41] some shitcoin project I'm
[56:44] happy and if look look at what happened
[56:48] with the ETFs the amount of capital that
[56:50] flows into it and we all know it's not
[56:52] real Bitcoin but guess what it helps if
[56:55] the Boomers can can allocate
[56:57] 100k from their trading account that
[56:58] just sits there in Fiat anyway via phone
[57:01] because the lazy to not log into a
[57:02] web interface and they tell the broker
[57:05] hey just buy some of these shares and
[57:06] like I'm okay if it performs well this
[57:08] is a big step we didn't have this before
[57:11] and I've heard about Bitcoin ETF since
[57:14] 201 13 14 when was the wiggle was one I
[57:18] remember getting picked up in 2014 I
[57:20] remember Pete Rizo actually writing
[57:21] about it very early on and reading about
[57:23] it and it's failing and you know all of
[57:25] these things so we finally got there and
[57:28] if we can do the same thing with
[57:31] investor money um this is going to be a
[57:33] net positive because we see what people
[57:36] do with little to nobody in the Bitcoin
[57:38] Community imagine what's possible if
[57:40] they can actually spend money to get it
[57:42] out to more
[57:43] people definitely and we need more
[57:45] Capital uh investment in Bitcoin we need
[57:47] more people talking about Bitcoin we
[57:49] need more podcast we need more
[57:51] everything like uh I'm I'm encouraging
[57:53] everybody to be welcome about stuff like
[57:56] if we try to like oh they should not be
[57:59] involved in in Bitcoin because this and
[58:01] that like what the we are trying to
[58:04] revolutionize money H we are trying to
[58:07] welcome everybody in and you saying he
[58:09] cannot be involved because what he
[58:12] did it kind of leads me actually into
[58:14] something um I'm really fed up about the
[58:16] Bitcoin community and I think uh not to
[58:19] put me at the same level as sailor um
[58:21] I'm definitely not there um I mean
[58:24] frankly no I mean frankly there may be
[58:26] stuff I understand better than he does
[58:29] mainly how to talk to people because um
[58:31] he's actually if you if you see him at
[58:32] the conference he's really funny if like
[58:34] a lot of people get to him you just know
[58:36] the guy either has autism or he just
[58:37] doesn't like a lot of people uh because
[58:39] he's he's like his nervous system breaks
[58:41] down he doesn't know what to do at this
[58:43] point he just takes his selfies he moves
[58:44] on um he's sort of the grumpy dude um
[58:47] but I I best he just wants to have his
[58:49] pce and stuff that on a fun s side note
[58:51] but what I'm really fed up with about
[58:53] the ecosystem is we're sometimes very BL
[58:56] mind to our own beliefs and what I mean
[58:58] by this is oh you know stuff like we've
[59:00] already won well what does winning look
[59:02] like like I don't think so personally
[59:05] are is everyone on Earth using Bitcoin
[59:07] no so in that terms I think we don't
[59:08] have we haven't one um or also things
[59:11] like oh yeah it's for everyone but then
[59:14] you have people who may have legit
[59:16] criticism and I'm not talking about
[59:17] energy or things but you know thought
[59:20] experiments like uh um should we should
[59:22] we stick to the 21 million I personally
[59:24] think so we should or do we have a
[59:27] flexible system that um has a consensus
[59:30] change and it's written into code and we
[59:32] can all still vote on these things and
[59:34] people like this get ripped apart I'm
[59:36] not saying that this is a good thing I
[59:37] don't believe it would be but we at
[59:40] least should have the open discussion
[59:41] about it and sometimes this can be very
[59:43] much guided you know by these online
[59:45] voices because it is cool to be Pro or
[59:48] against something having said that
[59:50] though if you've never been to meetups
[59:53] and you meet bitcoiners in real life go
[59:55] do this because the more people you meet
[59:57] in real life the more you realize oh um
[60:00] people actually think a lot more alike
[60:02] and they are more open to this talking
[60:04] about these thoughts than what appears
[60:06] on social media because guess what
[60:08] everyone of us is a on social
[60:10] because it is cool and it is that
[60:12] dopamine that hits you early in the
[60:13] morning or late at night if you need it
[60:15] um but yeah if there is one thing I
[60:17] would criticize it's exactly that we we
[60:19] we need to be a bit more I think
[60:21] critical and a bit more open-minded
[60:24] really open-minded to all so hey except
[60:26] if there is criticism and people are not
[60:28] going to change their mind or something
[60:30] that's fine but at least we're having
[60:32] the
[60:33] discussion 100% I like I couldn't even
[60:36] agree more it's like really really cool
[60:38] what you're saying and I think this is
[60:40] um an refreshing Bitcoin conversation
[60:43] today and I like where we are going with
[60:45] it um but we are actually unfortunately
[60:48] coming closer to the end before we
[60:49] coming to the end routine which is an
[60:52] amazing interesting question and it it
[60:54] really ties back to what we just just
[60:56] said and I'm really curious what you're
[60:57] saying then uh before I want to ask you
[61:00] something completely unrelated to
[61:01] bitcoin you write a lot I saw your subst
[61:04] you write uh for for a relay you write
[61:06] for yourself uh you you do a lot with
[61:09] with writing things down writing your
[61:11] thoughts to and I think this helps you
[61:15] form your um thoughts form your
[61:18] arguments well in your head and I
[61:20] unfortunately don't do it like I don't
[61:23] do any writing I do a lot of speaking I
[61:25] have uh I'm coming to a routine where I
[61:27] have two podcasts a day one for myself
[61:30] and one where I'm a guest appearing so
[61:32] it's like I'm I'm really speaking a lot
[61:34] and I know that I'm getting better in
[61:36] speaking actually with that uh
[61:38] experience but I but for people that uh
[61:42] did not do any riding uh for themselves
[61:45] like I'm not talking about riding with
[61:47] their friends I'm not talking about
[61:50] posting on Twitter I'm actually thinking
[61:53] saying about like sitting down and
[61:55] writing in comp prehensive article about
[61:57] a topic and really thinking the this
[62:00] thing through like this is a different
[62:01] kind of writing uh I think you know what
[62:03] I mean do you recommend to people to
[62:06] start doing this what what changes or
[62:08] what benefits do did you get from from
[62:10] doing that and would you even encourage
[62:13] me to to uh start writing
[62:15] something yeah definitely um I'm just
[62:18] trying to look for my backpack because I
[62:22] can showed us with a more visual uh
[62:24] quote which really help me because
[62:27] there's two things to my writing so I'm
[62:29] not a slow typer or anything I I can I
[62:31] would say I could type pretty fast but
[62:33] I'm horrible at grammar like thank God
[62:35]  like grammarly and Mentor D that
[62:38] these things exist um because uh you
[62:40] know I don't know all of my journalist
[62:43] friends we somehow are bad at grammar
[62:44] there's always like one of these um I
[62:46] call them like the comma Nazi because
[62:48] you know they always know what like the
[62:50] rules are and what they need to do and I
[62:51] have a very good friend of mine she uh
[62:53] she always actually comes up to me and
[62:54] goes like ah you should from this
[62:56] sentence differently um but what really
[62:58] helps me is I think if you're right um
[63:01] all you do is you're just expressing
[63:02] your thoughts and our heads are messy
[63:05] everyone has a different thought pattern
[63:08] um I mean there's countless studies of
[63:10] how different ways um our brains work
[63:12] with like the left hemisphere the right
[63:14] Hemisphere and these things but what
[63:15] really helped me is basically you know
[63:17] like you did in school um I can may put
[63:20] this on camera just having these notes
[63:22] and having these Doodles and having
[63:23] these things in your everyday life this
[63:26] is a notebook I started two weeks ago
[63:28] and it's already almost full like one of
[63:29] these little fill up ones and just
[63:32] expressing what you're feeling um taking
[63:34] notes wherever you can this doesn't mean
[63:36] I document my entire life but sometimes
[63:38] I have an idea and I pick out this
[63:40] notebook and I write it down I doodle it
[63:41] down whatever um and getting used to
[63:44] really expressing your thoughts I like
[63:46] to draw and write by hand other people
[63:49] you know record their voice um they they
[63:52] take photos screenshots of stuff
[63:54] whatever it is trying to have an
[63:56] expression and then having that data
[63:59] there to either process it into an
[64:01] article a video or just something um you
[64:04] want to express I think this helps
[64:06] immensely whether this makes you better
[64:08] writer I don't know if I look at the
[64:10] time spent as a journalist with my
[64:12] editors and fighting for the way I want
[64:15] to say a sentence or not um knowing I'm
[64:17] I'm fully in the wrong probably because
[64:19] the grammar doesn't hold up but I want
[64:21] to express it my way and I want to add
[64:23] my character um I think this is the
[64:26] right way to go people engage if
[64:28] something is authentic and this doesn't
[64:30] have to be perfect because nothing is in
[64:32] life um and I think the more you express
[64:34] yourself in these kind of different ways
[64:36] and you put something out there the more
[64:38] you're also find your in the voice and
[64:40] the more you're able to then publish
[64:41] these articles videos whatever it might
[64:43] be um and yeah who knows maybe you're
[64:46] able to pick up writing on a daily basis
[64:48] I write a lot on a daily basis I don't
[64:50] publish a lot of my own writing I really
[64:51] should get into this a bit more um but
[64:54] yeah it it definitely helps to put stuff
[64:57] out there express yourself in whatever
[64:59] shape or form possible and um you know
[65:02] get started hitting the keys or cutting
[65:06] videos or whatever it might be just get
[65:08] out there and express these things I
[65:09] think this really helps to to get into
[65:11] that groove of producing content
[65:14] expressing your emotions or just um
[65:16] having some time to yourself early in
[65:18] the morning or late at night to uh sit
[65:19] down and write yeah I think uh I think
[65:23] uh especially writing video is like
[65:27] there there's something to writing that
[65:29] is special when you sit down you're
[65:31] going over the sentence you're like how
[65:33] can I form this better how can I
[65:35] structure that argument better uh with
[65:37] video it's really cool it evolves your
[65:39] speaking skills a lot and it also
[65:42] involves how you think of course uh but
[65:45] I think you uh need also the writing
[65:47] thing and the writing thing is something
[65:49] that um is is missing a mindset I've
[65:52] thought a lot about it I might start a
[65:55] new letter with uh the seven biggest
[65:59] lessons from my seven podcasts I did per
[66:01] week uh with just like list it up uh
[66:04] this is something that I might start if
[66:06] I have a little bit more time because I
[66:09] cannot handle the workload right now uh
[66:11] but this is something I thought and I
[66:14] might actually started it in April or
[66:16] May so maybe even it's maybe I even
[66:19] started it uh when when this comes out
[66:21] let's see um we are having an end
[66:23] routine in the podcast where the
[66:24] previous guest is asking a question for
[66:27] the next guest without knowing who is
[66:29] the next guest uh and uh the question
[66:33] for you is and it ties back to what we
[66:35] talked about a little bit what changes
[66:37] would you mandate to the Bitcoin Network
[66:40] assuming you have total
[66:42] control oh
[66:44] wow uh so basically become God for a day
[66:49] over the entire network that is a very
[66:53] well that's a very good question I would
[66:56] so Network includes everything that
[66:59] includes main layer and obviously the
[67:01] main layer has um uh has a connection to
[67:04] all of these layers
[67:07] top I would say finding a way to
[67:11] solve the liquidity issue in lightning
[67:14] simplifying it I don't know I and
[67:17] hated on Lightning before but just with
[67:19] the thought if if I could do it
[67:21] overnight like this um meaning it would
[67:25] be so so simple that everyone can just
[67:27] get on Bitcoin in a self- sovereign way
[67:30] let's call it depends if they get on the
[67:32] main layer or into a scaling
[67:34] solution this would be pretty cool
[67:36] whatever that would be if it's inbound
[67:38] outbound liquidity issues you you can
[67:40] solve instantly or um all of these
[67:43] different implementations working in
[67:45] sync and like not breaking and all of
[67:47] that stuff whatever it is just trying to
[67:49] fix that most current need in these
[67:52] scaling and in between Solutions I think
[67:55] this would be the biggest benefit to
[67:56] bitcoin um otherwise I could think of of
[68:01] of of anything else at this point really
[68:04] really cool um TR I love to have you on
[68:06] it was such an amazing discussion I
[68:08] think uh like over one hour now we
[68:10] talked about Bitcoin life and so many
[68:12] different things and uh thank you for
[68:15] taking this time thank you all the
[68:16] listeners for listening and watching in
