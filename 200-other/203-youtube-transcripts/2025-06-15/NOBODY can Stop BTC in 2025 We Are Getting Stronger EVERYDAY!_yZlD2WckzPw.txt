[00:02] already done you don't put this thing
[00:04] back in the box there are more people
[00:06] joining the Bitcoin Network each day
[00:08] every single day than are leaving it and
[00:10] that's the real number go up the amount
[00:11] of people that join the network I really
[00:13] don't think we've even got off the
[00:15] starting blocks here hold on like I said
[00:17] sit on your hands expect much higher
[00:18] Bitcoin prices here they are here come
[00:20] Wall Street and whether you like it or

[00:24] who's going to sit there and buy Bitcoin
[00:26] and you can't tell me who's good for
[00:28] Bitcoin who's bad for Bitcoin but what
[00:29] you can do on an individual level is
[00:32] stay vigilant Carry On Learning
[00:34] educating yourself and being ready for
[00:36] these attacks they're not going to be
[00:38] able to attack the Bitcoin but they are
[00:40] going to be able to attack your
[00:41] conviction Bitcoin is here more and more
[00:43] people are finding each day come what

[01:19] inspiration for me you I don't know if
[01:21] you're aware of that but I think you the
[01:23] second or the third uh podcast that had
[01:26] me ever on uh on his show uh in eng
[01:29] English I had one in German and then one
[01:31] in English and I think you were the
[01:33] third ever podcast that had me as a

[01:38] of putting my face out there so thank
[01:41] you so much for that also oh you're
[01:43] welcome mate you're welcome yeah uh I
[01:46] love doing that all plebs are welcome
[01:48] I've just had a a great interview with
[01:51] with Joe Bryan who just dropped his
[01:54] what's the problem presentation video
[01:56] and it's just amazing that he's had such
[01:59] a impact so quickly and he'll tell you
[02:04] you know that the only
[02:05] reason he stepped into the into the fold
[02:08] here to to get his message across was
[02:11] because he was invited along to a
[02:14] completely unrelated weekend to give a
[02:17] presentation about something that he was
[02:19] passionate about to a group of of other
[02:21] friends and individuals so he gave this
[02:23] presentation and it was really well
[02:25] received and then he was like oh well
[02:27] now I'm cuz I've got to show this
[02:29] to every body and I've got to make this
[02:32] open source and look what's happened he
[02:34] he presented it at a Bitcoin Meetup in
[02:36] Bristol in the UK then made an
[02:38] Incredible video he hired a production
[02:40] team to get that out there in in the
[02:43] best most professional way and he's
[02:46] going to take 2025 by storm like you
[02:48] took 2024 by storm and we just need
[02:51] these plebs this fresh
[02:54] new kind creativity this fresh new idea
[02:58] and it doesn't matter if it's a podcast
[02:59] or YouTube video or a presentation or a
[03:02] song or a dance like bring it bring all
[03:05] of it Bitcoin fiction actually that's
[03:07] that's have you been reading any of the
[03:09] Bitcoin fiction books oh no I was not
[03:12] aware of this who who is writing those
[03:15] so I've got uh I've got a few on my
[03:17] bookshelf behind me I can grab them in a
[03:19] second but rvy Bor uh he wrote a book
[03:22] called
[03:23] 24 and inside that book actually is a
[03:26] treasure CH a treasure hunt uh for some
[03:29] Sato
[03:30] he he hid a seed word that's why it's
[03:32] called 24 uh that was that was an
[03:35] incredible addition to the Bitcoin book
[03:37] scene in 2024 then Nicholas Nell he's
[03:40] written the uh the Nakamoto consensus
[03:44] and that's kind of
[03:45] a uh Jack Reacher style Thriller about
[03:50] Satoshi and you know the the formation
[03:52] of Bitcoin and uh that was really a
[03:55] really fun read uh Bill arenson released
[03:58] a book called The Cathedral doesn't
[04:00] sound as though it has anything to do
[04:01] with Bitcoin but it's a fictional book
[04:03] about Bitcoin and yeah it's just great
[04:06] to see that there's a new wave of
[04:10] creativity coming into into the space
[04:12] and Toma excuse me Toma Strite his book
[04:15] was released by Scott and Maller at the
[04:17] shamur uh the shamur team over in the US
[04:22] uh Satoshi Nakamoto and his Bitcoin
[04:24] invention and it's a kids book kids fic
[04:26] well it's not Fiction it's the real
[04:27] story it's just that the character is
[04:29] are fictional because they're little um
[04:32] uh plushy style characters you know in
[04:34] tune with the Shar Marie characters so
[04:36] there's there's all kinds of stuff going
[04:38] on and in 2025 we just see more and more
[04:41] of that it's kind of amazing where I'm
[04:44] like uh I'm sitting here doing every day
[04:46] a Bitcoin podcast and I'm trying to get
[04:48] as close to the Bitcoin Community as
[04:50] possible but there's so much more like
[04:52] you you you don't even like you
[04:54] interviewed 360 people and the depth of
[04:56] the community just goes so much deeper
[04:58] and so much wider you just barely
[05:00] scratch the surface it's kind of unreal
[05:02] to to see how big this community and how
[05:05] deep this community goes and what the
[05:06] community is capable of I'm amazed yeah
[05:10] it's crazy every time I have a podcast
[05:12] on with somebody that has DMD me on
[05:15] Twitter and for whatever reason they've
[05:18] listened to a show and said you know
[05:21] I've got something extra to say about
[05:22] that and you didn't touch on this and
[05:24] you could have expanded here I'm like
[05:26] yeah I'm new to this subject so you
[05:28] please come on tell me more about it
[05:30] tell me where what we missed and what we
[05:33] should have expanded on and there's
[05:35] there's an episode with red tail hawk
[05:38] I've done two with him now I had no idea
[05:40] this guy existed right until he turned
[05:42] up in my DMs and he turns out he works
[05:45] for Bitcoin mining company super
[05:47] intelligent guy really interesting story
[05:50] and the last episode we did with him he
[05:52] was talking about ancient lost
[05:53] civilizations like the Graham Hancock
[05:55] stuff and uh how that all fits in with
[05:59] his theory of the polls shifting
[06:02] and blows your mind absolutely blows
[06:05] your mind there's so many people in this
[06:09] arena with so many incredible thoughts
[06:11] and stories and experiences that there's
[06:14] no way people say to me that you're
[06:18] going to carry on with the podcast like
[06:20] oh my God are you kidding I've only
[06:22] booked up through much like you can't so
[06:25] many plebs so little time and we grow in
[06:28] number every single day
[06:30] absolutely it's impossible to get to
[06:32] everyone this was actually one of my
[06:34] concerns if I can do a daily Bitcoin
[06:36] podcast I was like okay once I get the
[06:38] production done is there enough
[06:39] interesting people out there and turns
[06:41] out I can do it two or three times per
[06:43] day I cannot do it physically but I
[06:46] could do it from the guest side um I'm
[06:49] curious you also talked to so many
[06:51] people uh what what is kind of your
[06:53] biggest learning from 2024 what was what
[06:56] was the the year 2024 in Bitcoin for you
[06:58] all about
[07:01] wow the end of year review podcast I did
[07:04] with mechanic Bitcoin mechanic we went
[07:07] through actually let
[07:09] me and I chose mechanic to do the end of
[07:12] year uh because he was one of the
[07:15] leading voices in all of the problems
[07:18] that were going on throughout 2024 so I
[07:20] made a list of things to talk about that
[07:24] we could touch on so the talking point
[07:27] of
[07:28] 2024 so my uh my response to you the
[07:31] main takeaway I I'll tell you the main
[07:33] takeaway afterwards I'll I'll give you
[07:34] the list of the topics of 2024 Drive
[07:38] chains ordinals inscriptions vc20 tokens
[07:44] timestamps oper returns filters knots
[07:48] datum covenants runes
[07:51] CTV cat spam osificante
[07:59] ISM uh templates orange check marks dust
[08:04] utx o bloat there was a ton to talk
[08:07] about in
[08:08] 2024 and all of that stuff that I just
[08:11] listed was really
[08:14] negative negative stuff towards Bitcoin
[08:18] and here we are still standing it's like
[08:22] the the Gladiator meme you know are you
[08:24] not entertained whatever was thrown at
[08:26] Bitcoin in 2024
[08:30] made a few you know dents and scratches
[08:33] caused some big arguments some people
[08:35] were calling it block siiz wars 2.0 an
[08:38] attack on bit on bitcoin especially with
[08:40] the spam uh so here we are that I think
[08:44] that is the biggest talking point and I
[08:46] think that's the biggest thing we should
[08:47] be taking away from all of that nonsense
[08:50] that was going on in 2024 and we had the
[08:53] harving people have forgotten the
[08:56] Haring that was only in April so that
[08:59] was only just what nine months nine
[09:02] months ago and it it's fresh forgotten
[09:06] and at that time there was a T do
[09:09] you remember during those first few
[09:11] blocks fees spiked to like
[09:15] 6650 SATs per V or something uh so that
[09:19] was a talking point a huge talking point
[09:22] uh so yeah but yeah here we are going
[09:24] into
[09:25] 2025 The Narrative is slowly moving away
[09:28] from that whole list of stuff but what's
[09:31] coming what's going to be the next
[09:34] attack vector and we must stay vigilant
[09:37] it's interesting that attack rors
[09:39] because there's every like there's every
[09:42] day some attacks on bitcoin on a small
[09:44] level on a big level um and we kind of
[09:47] have to be aware of that and at least
[09:50] talk about that um do do you see any
[09:52] dangers in that do you see any any any
[09:55] things with that especially if more and
[09:56] more institutions come in a lot of
[09:58] people still feel here uh Black Rock in
[10:00] a big way or other big companies even
[10:03] micro strategy and and and other bigger
[10:05] corporations coming into Bitcoin and
[10:07] having more and more influence uh on
[10:09] bitcoin also on on the
[10:11] community they'll have influence on
[10:13] people but they won't have influence on
[10:15] bitcoin necessarily like changing
[10:17] Bitcoin changing the core code of
[10:19] Bitcoin is that doesn't happen overnight
[10:22] thankfully that that's all baked into
[10:25] the uh you know the consensus mechanism
[10:28] but it will influence people and people
[10:31] this is why you need to stay vigilant
[10:33] because yes corporations are coming in
[10:34] and there's a bunch of people out there
[10:36] that are going to scream and yell and
[10:38] pound their fists Bitcoin was not made
[10:40] for these people we don't want these
[10:42] people this is not the ethos well tough
[10:43]  here they are it was always
[10:46] going to happen always going to happen
[10:48] here they are here come Wall Street and
[10:50] whether you like it or not you can't
[10:53] change it and you can't change who's
[10:55] going to sit there and buy Bitcoin you
[10:57] absolutely can't and you can't tell me
[11:00] who's good for Bitcoin who's bad for
[11:02] Bitcoin but what you can do on an
[11:04] individual level is stay vigilant Carry
[11:08] On Learning educating yourself and being
[11:10] ready for these these attacks in in air
[11:14] quotes when they come because they're
[11:16] not going to be able to attack the
[11:18] Bitcoin you know network but they are
[11:21] going to be able to attack
[11:23] your your conviction that's what's
[11:26] coming under attack and people are going
[11:28] to get shaken out of their Bitcoin and
[11:29] it's going to be one hell of a shame
[11:32] because they will be able to move the
[11:35] market they will be able to add
[11:38] volatility into the market at whim just
[11:41] because of the amount of liquidity and
[11:43] the amount of power that buying power or
[11:45] selling power that they have and now we
[11:47] have options we have derivatives on top
[11:50] of spot prices and the only people
[11:53] really be able to control those in any
[11:55] meaningful way are going to be the big
[11:58] institutions again
[11:59] so if you have institutions that have
[12:03] got a very big position on bitcoin three
[12:08] four five six months out whatever that
[12:10] expiry date is come the time of that
[12:13] expiry date you're going to have a big
[12:15] institution on one side of it that are
[12:17] thinking we need this to hit this uh you
[12:21] know uh finishing the money here and on
[12:24] the other side they're going to be
[12:25] thinking exactly the same thing and
[12:27] they'll be using their power and their
[12:29] liquidity their buying and selling power
[12:32] in the spot Market to try and influence
[12:35] the price and they'll be using their
[12:36] narratives because they can get on CNBC
[12:39] and squog boox and say whatever they
[12:40] want in mainstream media to try and move
[12:43] the price in certain directions so we're
[12:45] going to see a very choppy Waters over
[12:48] the always in Bitcoin it's a volatile
[12:51] asset uh but people need to understand
[12:54] what's going on that they that they're
[12:57] going to have their conviction tested
[12:59] and it's going to be down to the
[13:00] individual to keep learning about it to
[13:03] understand fundamentally Bitcoin is
[13:06] going to be just fine the price is going
[13:08] to go up the price is going to go down
[13:10] you've got to figure out how to sit on
[13:12] your hands and get comfortable self
[13:16] custody in your Bitcoin not getting over
[13:18] your skis not getting into ridiculous uh
[13:22] margin calls and overleveraging and
[13:24] leveraging your Bitcoin or lending your
[13:26] Bitcoin out to anybody like Let The
[13:28] Professional do that you know sailor's
[13:32] going to do that that's fine he can do
[13:34] it he understands it deeply and no he
[13:38] probably didn't five years ago I'm sure
[13:40] he's had many advisors in his ear this
[13:43] is what we do this is how we do it then
[13:44] we do this then we do that then we split
[13:47] the stock then we offer these notes then
[13:49] convertible bonds and all of this kind
[13:51] of stuff they're redefining uh that side
[13:54] of um fixed income as as Preston was
[13:58] talking on my podcast at the end of the
[14:00] year that they're mining the debt
[14:02] markets so are and the fixed income
[14:04] markets excuse me and so are now other
[14:06] corporations and again people listening
[14:09] to this going to say Bitcoin isn't for
[14:11] corporations they shouldn't be allowed
[14:13] to buy it they can't put it on their
[14:14] balance sheet they're only going to hold
[14:16] it with a third party custodian that's
[14:18] not real Bitcoin ethers again doesn't
[14:21]  matter because they're going to
[14:23] buy it anyway whether we like it or not
[14:27] uh so just
[14:30] staying convicted Diamond
[14:33] hands and holding your Bitcoin holding
[14:36] your Bitcoin in your possession self-
[14:39] custody that's the main thing and uh
[14:42] that's what I think a lot of people
[14:44] really need to get more comfortable with
[14:47] going into the next couple of years for
[14:49] sure absolutely yeah this this EOS of
[14:52] Bitcoin is for everyone even for people
[14:54] we disagree with even for your worst
[14:56] enemy like Bitcoin is truly for for
[14:59] everyone this includes people on the top
[15:02] this includes all those corporations
[15:03] that we might not like or might like
[15:06] however you want to see it one one thing
[15:08] you brought up was interesting uh CNBC
[15:12] and this how is it called Squad Squad
[15:15] box and those things um I see a big
[15:19] shift uh especially with the
[15:22] presidential election was also uh
[15:24] already visible from those traditional
[15:27] media sources to now finally this
[15:30] individual content creators we saw
[15:32] Donald Trump with that Adrian guy with
[15:36] that streamer that shocked me the most I
[15:39] I was not shocked that he was on show
[15:40] Rogan and that he was on on podcasters
[15:43] but with the Adrian that that was really
[15:45] Adrien Ross I think it was his name that
[15:48] really shocked me that um um the the in
[15:53] condom system the the traditional system
[15:56] has to come to individual content
[15:58] creators to small Productions of like 5
[16:01] 10 people uh and not to those tens of
[16:04] thousands of thousands of people with
[16:06] with
[16:07] cbcs uh and maybe you can also as a as a
[16:10] podcaster talk a little bit about that
[16:13] power shift to the individual that is
[16:15] kind of happening uh right now yeah
[16:18] absolutely uh one second because I'm
[16:21] just double-checking a name here um
[16:24] because this is this has been going on
[16:27] for a little while uh yeah Maxim Bernier
[16:31] uh Maxim Bernier is a he's a member of
[16:34] parliament in Canada and I remember him
[16:38] coming on John Val's
[16:41] podcast back in
[16:43] 2019 2020 I want to say uh to have a
[16:48] discussion it was all about the same
[16:50] kind of time that Pierre POV in Canada
[16:53] as well was you know starting to make
[16:55] some some noise in uh that the houses of
[16:57] Commons or whatever they call it over
[16:59] there their parliamentary meetings uh so
[17:02] it has been happening for for longer
[17:04] than we remember and uh it's it's really
[17:09] like you I I can't believe how quickly I
[17:13] me it's called the Overton window right
[17:15] when you know these policies um excuse
[17:18] me these C the these conversations these
[17:20] narratives
[17:22] become right at the center of policy
[17:26] that's where the Overton window is like
[17:27] completely open open discussion about it
[17:30] and for the longest time what Bitcoin 16
[17:34] years out of those 16 years I mean the
[17:36] amount of fud that's been thrown at
[17:39] Bitcoin in that I mean it still happens
[17:41] to this day the Overton window has
[17:43] always been you know pretty close nobody
[17:46] wanted to talk about it not in any
[17:48] particularly uh rational way let's say
[17:52] but
[17:53] now my God now you you have politicians
[17:57] using it as a way to gain political
[18:01] power and to get votes and to put it on
[18:06] like the top of
[18:08] their one two or three points that they
[18:12] want to start you know talking about
[18:14] when they're out there on the campaign
[18:15] Trail and to see that in the US that was
[18:20] that was crazy I mean we no longer
[18:21] Fringe politicians like John had back in
[18:25] 2020 but like mainstream biggest country
[18:28] in the world like the most powerful
[18:30] country in the world with you know the
[18:31] the world's Reserve currency the United
[18:36] States openly Shilling Bitcoin to
[18:40] potential voters wow we got here so
[18:45] damn quick like this is just 16 years in
[18:50] and and as much as Trump again look I
[18:53] have nothing to say about the guy I have
[18:55] nothing to say about politicians I think
[18:56] it's all a fast and theater but here we
[18:59] are it's on mainstream media it's
[19:02] getting beamed around the world
[19:04] politicians are openly talking about it
[19:06] and using it as a uh you know an arrow
[19:11] in their quiver a weapon a tool to sway
[19:16] certain members of the public so that
[19:18] tells me that they clearly have data
[19:22] on the way that a certain percentage of
[19:26] the population is thinking about
[19:29] Bitcoin yeah they have to kind of they
[19:31] they have to realize that it's kind of
[19:35] Bitcoin Community is at a critical mass
[19:37] point where uh you can't ignore them
[19:41] anymore you have to be on one or other
[19:44] the other side and it's it benefits you
[19:47] a lot if you're on on on the pro side
[19:50] and it doesn't benefit you if if you're
[19:53] on the on the con side on the con side
[19:55] it's benefits you more if you just don't
[19:57] say anything then you don't make enemies
[19:59] uh but yeah it's it's an interesting
[20:01] it's also interesting how all of where
[20:04] where are you what country are you in uh
[20:06] Austria uh the the heart of Europe
[20:09] Austria okay and have any of your
[20:11] politicians have I I mean here the
[20:14] school of Austrian economics I mean is
[20:16] anybody there talking about it it's very
[20:19] it's very sad unfortunately um we have
[20:22] now in Germany Finance Minister the the
[20:26] the no longer Finance Minister I don't
[20:28] know the word call is the the previous
[20:30] Finance Minister Christian Lindner um
[20:33] now talking about Bitcoin on the day he
[20:35] was uh was going out of the uh German
[20:39] Parliament he was all of the sudden
[20:40] talking about Bitcoin now he met uh in
[20:43] the parliament with some big uh German
[20:46] content creators um so but he does that
[20:49] because there's now a vote an election
[20:52] happening in February in in Germany a
[20:55] new vote and a new election uh so it's
[20:58] interesting how four years as a finance
[21:01] minister he ignored that topic uh and
[21:04] this was also in the time where uh
[21:07] Germany sold this 50k Bitcoin not
[21:10] Germany it was a part of Germany so it
[21:12] was not directly his thing it was uh
[21:15] Saxony Saxony exactly yeah um and now to
[21:21] Austria Austria is usually a little bit
[21:23] slower to Innovation um and there was no
[21:28] talk at all in the last elections of
[21:31] Bitcoin not not at all uh not even about
[21:34] digital assets or the or or new forms of
[21:38] currencies this this was just not a
[21:39] talking point which really disappointed
[21:42] me I read all of the uh election papers
[21:46] and we have a popular Austrian podcaster
[21:50] niiko yil you probably know him uh in in
[21:53] in Austria and he uh got through the
[21:57] work of uh request
[21:59] position papers of all parties in
[22:01] Austria and trying to figure out what is
[22:04] their position to bitcoin and uh I can
[22:08] summarize that in one sentence his one
[22:10] hour long video it's sad it's it's they
[22:13] have all positions and you you can
[22:15] imagine okay they are like the
[22:17] Innovation friendly position and then
[22:19] they're like the environment concerned
[22:22] positions but it's all not really
[22:24] informed uh opinions it's more like
[22:27] political uh uh uh role so it's it's
[22:30] it's kind of um sad to see I hope that
[22:34] changes I hope uh this this uh reverses
[22:38] at some point we also in Austria got rid
[22:40] of the uh if you hold Bitcoin over one
[22:43] year you don't have to pay taxes we had
[22:45] that rule we don't have it anymore since
[22:48] 2021 uh so I'm not a big fan of where
[22:51] we're going politically in the Bitcoin
[22:54] Department I have a lot of Hope where we
[22:56] Direction go politically in in general
[22:59] uh but uh not in the political
[23:02] Department it's just not a discussion
[23:03] point I don't know how is this with you
[23:07] yeah I I saw uh Chris coin joined Chris
[23:10] Chris from sedor uh he tweeted there's a
[23:14] picture of him uh the former German
[23:16] Finance Minister might not be a
[23:17] bitcoiner yet but I handed him Lynn
[23:20] alden's broken money so let's see he's
[23:25] got that book in his hands and it's good
[23:27] to see that the German plebs they're
[23:30] they're great those guys they are very
[23:32] well organized sorry sorry to you know
[23:34] lay a stereotype on them but yeah
[23:37] they're organized they're organized they
[23:40] they're committed they are just an
[23:45] incredible uh like fraternity of of
[23:47] bitcoiners over there brothers and
[23:49] sisters all working together because
[23:51] when you look at I think somebody
[23:53] tweeted this out as well like the amount
[23:55] of German Bitcoin meetups like all over
[23:59] the country it's absolutely it's great
[24:02] to see and you have Rachel over there
[24:04] she's English lady working for terahash
[24:06] so she lives in Germany and she goes
[24:08] around and they have meetings all over
[24:11] the country with uh corporations that
[24:14] are interested in how could our business
[24:18] mine Bitcoin and what would it mean for
[24:21] our balance sheet so those kind of
[24:23] conversations are having are taking
[24:25] place excuse me and there's a bank there
[24:28] uh I can't remember the name folks Bank
[24:30] Bayern M right with yeah I think with
[24:34] with Joe I think you mean it right yep
[24:36] Joe Martin was that right yeah Joe Joe
[24:38] Martin with folks Bank uh and they are
[24:41] embracing Bitcoin they they host the
[24:43] biggest uh one of the biggest German uh
[24:46] speaking Bitcoin events soon I think
[24:49] like May or or or maybe August I don't
[24:52] know exactly the date but somewhere this
[24:54] this year with over thousand uh um
[24:57] participants
[24:58] and they're doing education they are
[25:00] Bitcoin not
[25:01] crypto uh they you can buy Bitcoin with
[25:05] them they partnered up with uh an
[25:07] Austrian Bitcoin only exchange 21
[25:09] Bitcoin like they're really going into
[25:12] Bitcoin and there's a lot of positive
[25:14] things happening uh uh in the German
[25:17] speaking area in Bitcoin but not on the
[25:19] political level yeah well it will happen
[25:23] it's inevitable and this is I think as
[25:27] well one thing
[25:29] we do focus a lot on the negative stuff
[25:33] and uh you know rightly so because you
[25:36] have to be like I said you've got to
[25:37] remain Vigilant and you got to see where
[25:39] the attacks are coming from but it's
[25:40] nice to step back every now and then and
[25:42] just take a breath and you're like you
[25:43] know what wow we're winning in fact we
[25:46] won it's already done that that you
[25:49] don't put this thing back in the box
[25:52] right there's no way this is out and
[25:54] there are more people joining the
[25:56] Bitcoin Network each day
[25:58] every single day then are leaving it and
[26:01] that's the real number go up the amount
[26:03] of people that join the network you know
[26:04] the price is one thing but more people
[26:07] are using Bitcoin every there'll be more
[26:10] people using Bitcoin joining the network
[26:12] tomorrow than there are today there
[26:13] won't be less and that will be true for
[26:15] the day after and the day after that and
[26:17] the day after that so inevitable
[26:21] and people like yourself doing your
[26:24] podcasts uh putting yourself out there
[26:27] we need another of you we need another
[26:29] thousand of me we need another thousand
[26:31] of Joe we need another thousand uh of
[26:34] Chris handing these books out one one
[26:37] great
[26:38] big uh project that was put together by
[26:42] orange pill app actually uh I think it
[26:44] was 23 they did this this stunt that I
[26:48] think there's
[26:49] 543 congressmen and women in the US they
[26:53] each got a copy of the Bitcoin standard
[26:55] courtesy of orange PAB and that was was
[26:58] an incredible thing to see when uh
[27:00] Republican excuse me Congressman Massie
[27:03] came out and started talking about
[27:05] having read the Bitcoin standard yada
[27:08] yada Y and quoting it and then he went
[27:10] on st's podcast like things like that
[27:12] like this is this is how we do it it's
[27:16] Grassroots stuff it's pleb work but it's
[27:20] also the the peaceful option right what
[27:24] what's the other option here you know
[27:25] just march on our respective parliaments
[27:28] and try and turn them out and turf them
[27:30] out and then vote somebody else in
[27:32] that's just going to do exactly the same
[27:34] that's not going to
[27:35] work are we were we last year maybe a
[27:38] little bit too focused on politics
[27:39] especially with Trump and all those
[27:41] things it feels like Bitcoin has got
[27:43] distracted yeah I think so
[27:47] uh for sure and then a lot of the
[27:50] narrative in the in the media was about
[27:53] um the price running up to
[27:56] $100,000 purely because Trump got
[27:58] elected well a load of
[28:01] nonsense okay I maybe retail got a
[28:05] little bit you know hot on the back of
[28:07] it and maybe some people in in
[28:10] institutions saw that as kind of a risk
[28:13] off uh metric but really we we all know
[28:18] what happens if you've been about
[28:19] Bitcoin long enough like I said the
[28:21] Haring was in April every year there's a
[28:24] every um every cycle when the Haring
[28:27] happen
[28:28] anytime 9 to 16 months after that is
[28:32] when the supply shock is realized in the
[28:34] market and that's when the bull run will
[28:37] start to happen and I I really don't
[28:39] think we've even even really got off the
[28:42] block starting blocks here uh so yeah
[28:45] hold on like I said sit on your hands
[28:47] expect much higher Bitcoin prices but
[28:49] like I said expect more manipulation as
[28:52] well I partnered up with coin vigilante
[28:56] this is the most beautiful
[28:58] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[29:01] created by anyone look at that beauty I

[31:05] absolutely yeah it's so fascinating how
[31:07] Austria had the same exact thing they
[31:09] said basically in the news oh Bitcoin is
[31:12] going up that much and it's because
[31:16] Trump yeah that was literally the one
[31:19] minute segment they did on the Austrian
[31:21] mainstream news and it feels like it's
[31:22] in every country the same thing uh
[31:25] reported it seem it almost seems like
[31:28] coordinated uh I don't know if it's
[31:29] coordinated or they're just riding from
[31:32] each other and they just I don't know in
[31:34] the same circles uh but it definitely
[31:37] feels feels like that yeah for sure
[31:41] absolutely um one thing uh actually
[31:43] wanted to start off with that question
[31:46] uh but uh how has your how has Bitcoin
[31:50] filled your life uh with more freedom
[31:54] how has Bitcoin impacted your life I
[31:56] remember when we last spoke with lot I
[31:58] talked a lot about that uh with M I was
[32:01] like maybe it's interesting to to get
[32:03] the other side in here
[32:06] yeah it just it takes
[32:08] away the it's kind of a weird thing
[32:12] paradoxical thing to say because the
[32:14] Bitcoin is volatile right if you look at
[32:16] the price that's volatile but in the
[32:18] other hand it takes the volatility away
[32:20] from your future because just by holding
[32:24] Bitcoin and understanding and having the
[32:25] conviction in Bitcoin and knowing that
[32:28] over time your purchasing power is going
[32:30] to go up you can that your worries Melt
[32:33] Away about the future whereas if
[32:36] everything that you own is in a fat
[32:38] currency that is being debased every
[32:40] second of every single day your future
[32:43] plans are completely up in the air you
[32:46] have no idea like you can't make
[32:50] long lasting decisions you can't think
[32:53] about you know like a a longlasting
[32:57] project let's say somebody I'm I'm not
[33:00] doing this personally but a lot of
[33:01] people are you know they're moving house
[33:03] well we have done that actually but
[33:05] they'll be moving house they'll be
[33:06] buying land they'll be thinking about 10
[33:09] 15 20 years down the line whereas before
[33:11] it's like just get up get through the
[33:13] next day and let's get to the weekend
[33:16] that's living the Fiat life living the
[33:17] Bitcoin life is like right let's this we
[33:20] we'll do this for this decade we'll put
[33:22] these things in place we we need to get
[33:25] here to there to there to there this is
[33:27] what we need to do and you can start
[33:28] actually planning and thinking clearly
[33:31] and uh that is the the superpower of
[33:34] Bitcoin it lowers your time preference
[33:37] and it gives you the ability to plan
[33:39] into the future because you know your
[33:41] purchasing power is going to be higher
[33:43] in 10 years time than it is today and
[33:46] that is something none of us have ever
[33:48] experienced before and having that
[33:51] feeling is it's lifechanging of course
[33:55] it's a complete u-turn
[33:57] that does come with problems because all
[34:01] of a sudden you could be I don't think
[34:03] this is talked about enough actually I
[34:05] remember doing an interview with gig or
[34:09] giggy the giggy uh back in 2020 and we
[34:13] got into a rabbit hole of of how Bitcoin
[34:16] can affect negatively affect uh
[34:20] relationships uh you know you've got a a
[34:22] married couple for example uh one of
[34:25] them is down the rabbit hole big time
[34:28] Big Time the other one refuses to go in
[34:32] but the person in the rabbit hole is
[34:34] having their whole
[34:37] mind rewired rebalanced I would say
[34:41] writed because the Fiat mind is inverse
[34:44] you know we're not supposed to be living
[34:46] that way and that can cause division
[34:49] between husbands wives brothers sisters
[34:52] aunties uncles family units uh so
[34:56] there's that to to take um note of as
[34:58] well and uh I I just want
[35:02] to have you noticed anything like that
[35:05] with within your own Journey how your
[35:08] relationship has changed with certain
[35:10] people I have uh
[35:15] always in the beginning I tried to
[35:17] Orange Peel people but I stopped really
[35:19] quickly and uh because I didn't want to
[35:22] interrupt my personal relationships what
[35:25] I did is talk constantly about it uh but
[35:28] stopped if I annoyed someone uh and then
[35:31] I shifted because of that because I
[35:33] annoyed more and more people because of
[35:35] that I shifted more online uh and people
[35:38] yeah they still watched my things on on
[35:40] Instagram on Twitter and stuff like that
[35:43] but on on their own time and I actually
[35:45] got to know that then people got orange
[35:47] build and they came to me and uh yeah my
[35:51] my free best friends they're all almost
[35:54] all in Bitcoin like completely uh with
[35:57] 80% and 70% of their net worth in
[35:59] Bitcoin uh my father my mother my sister
[36:04] they in Bitcoin sister is the hardest
[36:06] one to crack uh and uh the in the in the
[36:10] bigger family I have a really big family
[36:13] uh the people that are closest to me are
[36:15] the closest to bitcoin because they are
[36:18] the most exposed to do it um but yeah
[36:23] it's it didn't impact my relationship
[36:25] that it's interesting uh with my girl I
[36:28] came together with my girlfriend two
[36:30] years ago uh and I was purposely hiding
[36:35] my
[36:36] Bitcoin as long as possible so I didn't
[36:39] mention it even after like the third
[36:41] date some I think the fourth date she
[36:43] she asked a question because she saw
[36:45] something
[36:47] online my my profile I couldn't hide uh
[36:50] and uh then then we slowly talked about
[36:53] that but I never orange bued her I never
[36:55] really explained anything to her because
[36:57] I was like if she's really the one if
[36:58] she's really someone I want to be
[37:00] longterm with she will get Bitcoin
[37:03] eventually those things come together
[37:06] and now two years later she's actually
[37:08] there where she kind of understands it
[37:10] where she saves all her money in Bitcoin
[37:13] uh and she's on her way to really
[37:15] getting orange buil uh and never forced
[37:18] it on her so I think I don't know if if
[37:20] you have some learnings around this
[37:22] topic but I think not forcing it and and
[37:24] and still trying to to expose post them
[37:27] to bitcoin is kind of what I try to do
[37:30] do you have any recommendations for for
[37:32] maybe people listening that that
[37:34] struggle with relationships that with
[37:36] non bitcoiners yeah I always try and
[37:39] think about or ask first if people ask
[37:42] me I like okay how what's your preferred
[37:45] method to learn do you like listening to
[37:47] podcast do you like watching YouTube
[37:49] videos do you prefer to read that's
[37:52] that's like step one and then okay you
[37:55] know I I listen to podcast all the time
[37:57] all right okay cool now I know I can
[38:00] send you some podcasts of things you
[38:03] might be interested in but what are your
[38:04] hobbies what do you like doing like what
[38:06] what's uh what do you do at the weekends
[38:08] oh I like to play football oh really
[38:10] okay what team do you support oh this
[38:12] that and the other thing blah blah blah
[38:13] okay I'll send you some podcasts with
[38:16] professional footballers if you like
[38:17] like what who so well and this works
[38:21] really well with English people it's
[38:22] like Kieran Gibbs they're like what you
[38:25] the the Arsenal and England player like
[38:27] yeah he's a massive bitcoiner I've got a
[38:29] podcast with him I can send you that
[38:31] podcast and so is saer deine and saine
[38:33] amus he has the Bitcoin podcast and he
[38:35] wrote a book called the Bitcoin standard
[38:37] so you'll get exposed to that as well
[38:38] they're like yeah yeah send me the links
[38:40] I'd love to listen to it okay fine uh
[38:42] the the other day um I was talking to a
[38:45] guy that told me his son was slowly
[38:48] getting into it and I'm like okay well
[38:51] what does he like what what's what's his
[38:53] you know what's his thing he's like oh
[38:54] he loves his cars loves Motor Racing
[38:57] right okay does he know about Bitcoin
[38:58] racing he's like what you know Bitcoin
[39:01] racing they're here in the UK like they
[39:03] like you know they race around Brans hat
[39:05] and snon doing the mini virtue challenge
[39:07] they follow around the British Touring
[39:09] Car Championship I had no idea I'm like
[39:11] right okay I'll send you some podcasts
[39:13] that you can send onto your son with the
[39:15] Bitcoin racing team and once once the
[39:18] season starts coming up again they have
[39:19] a Bitcoin Meetup at every event so you
[39:22] can just get to BR hatch and you can get
[39:24] to these other races and we can go and
[39:26] start hanging out together and learn
[39:28] learning about Bitcoin and that will
[39:29] bring him much closer so this is the
[39:31] kind of thing that I mean it could be
[39:33] music and then I send them uh podcasts
[39:35] with musicians because we have uh you
[39:38] know the musicians now on wav lake or or
[39:41] Fountain uh and that gets their interest
[39:43] there's there's a way you can match
[39:45] someone's interest because human beings
[39:49] love social proof every salesperson
[39:52] knows this every salesperson knows
[39:55] social proof is the Foundation of a you
[39:59] know in a quotes a a buying decision and
[40:03] touch points any sales course will tell
[40:06] you this uh and this is all of that is
[40:09] just based on human psychology so if we
[40:11] understand human psychology and we can
[40:15] talk to the people that you know we
[40:17] truly love and care about we we already
[40:19] know what they're predisposed to what
[40:21] they like what they uh you know what
[40:25] sets them on fire and you can send them
[40:28] interviews that are going to match their
[40:31] interest so that's builtin social proof
[40:34] and if you know they prefer to read then
[40:36] you send them an article you send them a
[40:38] book if you know they prefer podcasts
[40:39] send them links or YouTube videos
[40:41] whatever and I find that that's way more
[40:44] effective then you just wait for the
[40:45] questions to come back I love that
[40:48] peer-to-peer education system I love
[40:50] that I think uh you also big prop uh big
[40:54] critic of of the educational system as
[40:57] as I am and and I love uh if if um
[41:01] peer-to-peer is kind of an education
[41:03] system where you can actually teach
[41:05] someone something else you also yeah I'm
[41:08] pretty sure that you homeschool your
[41:10] your kids Lauren I think was also in the
[41:12] podcast last time and I think we uh
[41:15] briefly uh T touched on that also um uh
[41:20] so you're doing homeschooling your kids
[41:22] till the beginning already
[41:24] or no we've done we've done every
[41:27] we've done uh State education montauri
[41:31] style we've done Beach on the school
[41:34] we've done what is montauri style
[41:37] montauri is much more focused on the
[41:39] individual and letting them try and
[41:43] learn through play rather than through
[41:46] curriculum which is great uh then we
[41:50] we've done State School uh in different
[41:53] countries in in Singapore and in France
[41:57] and we've done unschooling we've done
[42:00] World schooling where we took the kids
[42:01] traveling around the world for two and a
[42:03] half years so you're just literally
[42:05] learning daytoday on the go uh
[42:08] whatever's on your doorstep whatever you
[42:10] know wherever you find yourself that
[42:12] becomes your
[42:13] classroom and
[42:15] currently uh in the UK our our two
[42:19] youngest we found what's called a a SB
[42:22] Valley School which uh again is all it
[42:25] puts the onus on individual it it it
[42:28] puts Faith back in the the actual fact
[42:32] that our species are built to learn
[42:35] we're problem solving machines and we
[42:37] will get interested by certain things
[42:41] and following a curriculum that is set
[42:43] for you that you have to do under you
[42:46] know all circumstances at certain times
[42:48] of the day is actually alternative
[42:51] education that's the alternative system
[42:55] not the natural learning way that U you
[42:58] know the kids just learn what they're
[43:00] naturally interested in uh so that's the
[43:04] and that takes the form where three days
[43:06] a week uh lessons are put on at the in
[43:10] inverted comma school and the kids get
[43:14] the get the choice to go to those
[43:15] lessons if they want if they're
[43:17] interested but the kids are the ones
[43:20] that ask for these lessons and these
[43:23] teachers to be brought in themselves at
[43:25] the start of term where they have me
[43:27] meetings and discussions and say right
[43:29] yes well we want a math guy we want a
[43:31] french teaching person we want uh
[43:34] somebody to come and teach us how to do
[43:36] outdoor activities in the uh in the
[43:38] Woodlands here and yeah sure enough in a
[43:42] few weeks time those people are put in
[43:44] place then the kids opt into those
[43:46] lessons and it's a mixed age group and
[43:49] the only people in the classroom are the
[43:51] ones that have chosen to be there and
[43:52] are interested in that so that is you
[43:55] know as opposite to an educ ation system
[43:57] as I could imagine and uh that's what um
[44:01] that's what our two youngest are doing
[44:02] at the moment uh the older two are
[44:04] flying away at the moment um one of them
[44:07] is already in University and studying
[44:10] there and another one is doing uh some a
[44:13] levels at at a local College just like
[44:15] 10 minutes away interesting yeah so
[44:18] University is still the the the the
[44:21] state one is is a private
[44:24] one uh that is uh private one and yeah I
[44:29] think all all the universities are
[44:31] private uh and I'm I'm happy to see that
[44:37] there seems to be a shift now where
[44:41] uh it it was a weird the last 20 years
[44:45] it's been like you you have to go to
[44:48] university like it never used to be that
[44:50] way certainly not in England and the
[44:53] last 20 years it's like yeah you're
[44:54] never going to get anywhere if you don't
[44:56] go to university so people have been
[44:58] just going to University willy-nilly and
[45:01] uh even if they didn't want to be there
[45:02] get through the three or four years get
[45:04] themselves into debt and then finally
[45:06] get out into the uh you know the labor
[45:09] market that seems to be changing now
[45:11] that's good my my oldest daughter she's
[45:14] chosen to go to university but I don't
[45:16] think my other three kids will uh and
[45:19] that's that's an interesting thing um
[45:23] and a good thing because
[45:27] isn't for everybody it shouldn't be for
[45:29] everybody you know everybody is
[45:30] different and we need as many differing
[45:33] skills as possible not like the same
[45:37] three or four degrees that everybody's
[45:38] chasing after it's like inflation right
[45:42] everybody's got these three or four
[45:43] degrees that apparently got to guarantee
[45:45] you a job once you get out but yeah well
[45:48] supply and demand doesn't work that way
[45:50] absolutely and and you you you students
[45:53] usually learn that once they they try to
[45:56] find a job in they have some Dee and
[45:57] they F will definitely get something and
[46:00] I I I heard a lot of stories around that
[46:02] also in Austria we also unemployment
[46:05] rate is kind of rising here and so the
[46:08] stories of that sorts get bigger where
[46:11] they have to uh the university uh degree
[46:15] and with like 26 27 28 years old for the
[46:18] first time ever they try to work and
[46:20] then it's like really hard to find jobs
[46:22] because you're like a 26 27 year old uh
[46:26] uh uh man and you have no experience in
[46:29] the workplace but you have some degree
[46:31] which may or may not apply to your work
[46:34] and if it Supply is probably just like a
[46:36] percentage and then they have to still
[46:39] educate you on things so it's it's an
[46:42] interesting uh it's an interesting thing
[46:44] you're also parent of four as you just
[46:46] said and I think most bitcoiners uh are
[46:50] parents I think there's a really high
[46:52] correlation between being a Bitcoin and
[46:55] being a and a parent how would you
[46:57] define a Bitcoin or parent how you I
[47:01] don't know if you have outside of
[47:03] Bitcoin also parent friends that are
[47:05] non- bitcoiners and do you see some
[47:07] differences there yes I do yeah and
[47:10] there's you know I've seen a whole host
[47:12] of different Bitcoin families some that
[47:14] have very little babies or are about to
[47:17] have babies and then there are some like
[47:19] kind of more my age group you know I'm
[47:21] nearing 50 now and found Bitcoin uh
[47:25] after I'd already had my kids and uh
[47:27] there are families out there as well
[47:29] that I meet on the conference circuit
[47:31] when we're doing that uh you know
[47:32] already had kids and then found Bitcoin
[47:36] and then you know went through the the
[47:38] Mind virus and the and the change so
[47:41] what you mainly notice uh the difference
[47:44] is a calmness and again this comes back
[47:48] to what I was talking about being able
[47:49] to plan for the future and not having
[47:51] that you know too many worries about the
[47:53] future uh because Bitcoin is a when they
[47:57] look at their families and they look at
[47:58] their kids they they know like the the
[48:01] safety net is it's there you
[48:05] know it's fine go out into the world
[48:09] try and you will fail and you will pick
[48:13] yourself up nothing's going to work
[48:14] first time that's understood whereas in
[48:17] like the more fear kind of thinking
[48:20] world it's like go to university go you
[48:24] need or you know you need straight A's
[48:26] in your GCS or whatever you call them in
[48:27] equivalent you know SATs I don't know
[48:29] what they called across Europe that laak
[48:32] or Pro in in French uh you need straight
[48:35] A for all of that and then you've got to
[48:37] go to university and then you need like
[48:39] the top degree and then it's also got to
[48:42] be at the top university blah blah blah
[48:44] and it's just stress stress stress and
[48:47] pressure on the kid and Trauma on the
[48:50] kid and it's really depressing to see
[48:54] the like the the effect that has on on
[48:57] kids you know um you've got 11y olds
[49:01] here in the UK where they they sit this
[49:03] test it's called the 11 plus or at least
[49:06] it used to be and uh that will Define
[49:10] their secondary schooling and that will
[49:13] Define their a levels and that will
[49:15] Define their
[49:16] University put all that pressure on a 10
[49:19] and a half year old kid that just wants
[49:20] to play football in the garden and kick
[49:22] a ball against the fence or play on his
[49:24] gaming machine or ride his bike around
[49:26] like this is
[49:27] nonsense but that is what happens and so
[49:30] I see a complete difference now in in
[49:33] Bitcoin appearance they way more relaxed
[49:36] they've they've gone through you know
[49:38] the the understanding uh the you know
[49:41] Human Action and they the the Austrian
[49:44] method uh the business cycle they
[49:46] understand Bitcoin they understand the
[49:47] harving cycle they understand their
[49:49] purchasing power is going to be going up
[49:51] and they understand that they're they're
[49:53] becoming more and more bulletproof each
[49:55] day from this system and and that will
[49:58] be passed down to their kids
[50:01] uh you know actions speak louder than
[50:04] words that that their kids will pick up
[50:05] on these Vibes and just speaking to the
[50:08] kids around the conferences as well
[50:10] completely different experience
[50:12] completely different experience talking
[50:13] to bitcoiner kids than just kids that
[50:17] are going
[50:19] through the grinder of uh you know the
[50:22] Fiat system and the Fiat education
[50:25] system interesting also the the the
[50:28] sports of it as you said uh they're just
[50:31] playing outside and not having the the
[50:33] pressure just like experiencing life
[50:36] it's it's it's really interesting to to
[50:38] see what what part does Sports play in
[50:40] your and your family's life are you big
[50:42] on D yeah my son is very much into his
[50:45] football so you know always supporting
[50:48] him in that and my daughters really
[50:51] loved when we lived in France they
[50:52] really loved horse riding that was very
[50:54] accessible a very accessible sport where
[50:56] we were living cuz we were in the
[50:58] countryside and there were horses
[50:59] everywhere and riding stables everywhere
[51:01] so uh it was very easy to get them on
[51:03] Horseback so now we've we've changed
[51:06] location uh that's going to be a project
[51:09] for 2025 finding them you know the
[51:11] nearest Stables come spring when it
[51:14] becomes a little bit warmer for them to
[51:16] be out there and uh yeah that's that's
[51:18] the main thing uh for me I I love golf
[51:23] grew up playing football but I can't do
[51:25] that to my body anymore and uh you know
[51:27] watching it has become difficult because
[51:31] uh again you go through I don't know if
[51:33] you've ever experienced this but going
[51:35] through I I used to love watching all
[51:37] kinds of sports uh but now going through
[51:39] Bitcoin you re you know entering the
[51:41] Bitcoin Rabbit Hole you can see all of
[51:44] the Fiat crap that that's crept into the
[51:46] sport and um the inflated wages and even
[51:49] the Fiat behavior of the players and the
[51:53] bread and circuses aspect of it you know
[51:56] uh
[51:57] give them B give them bread and circuses
[51:59] they will not Revolt um but I'm a big
[52:03] fan of golf uh and I I like just being
[52:06] out there uh not in the winter so I'm
[52:08] looking forward to some spring and some
[52:10] summer uh to be out and playing and
[52:13] connecting with more bitcoiners that
[52:14] like to play golf because that that's
[52:15] the best thing you can do get out on the
[52:17] golf course with a bunch of bitcoiners
[52:20] and spend four or five hours out in the
[52:23] fresh air in nature talking having fun
[52:26] yeah I love that absolutely I think
[52:29] there's
[52:30] currently Bitcoin thing going on in El
[52:33] Salvador with golf uh I over heard
[52:36] something I'm not there but uh it's it's
[52:39] an interesting one yeah Max stac running
[52:41] a golf competition over there oh nice
[52:44] and that's being helped uh Chris and
[52:47] Freda bobe are helping that the Bitcoin
[52:48] Sports Network that they've put they've
[52:50] uh they've put together so look look out
[52:52] for that like there'll be more and more
[52:54] things like this there'll be football
[52:55] tournaments coach carbon in the UK he
[52:58] does the Bitcoin Ballers uh you've now
[53:00] got the the Bulgarian football team pla
[53:03] vid PD
[53:05] PD sorry George I'm mispronouncing it
[53:08] but he's doing great work over there uh
[53:11] like I mentioned earlier we've got the
[53:12] the Bitcoin racing team now we have
[53:14] these Bitcoin golf tournaments going on
[53:16] all over the place uh it's um it's
[53:20] another another way that the cultural
[53:23] aspect of Bitcoin is growing and that is
[53:27] really important because when when you
[53:29] have the cultural side of things that's
[53:31] when the shift really starts happening
[53:33] and that that's with artwork I mean go
[53:35] to any conference you'll see an art
[53:38] gallery now it's without doubt there
[53:40] will be an art gallery at a Bitcoin
[53:43] conference and they're amazing even some
[53:45] meetups they have all right and where's
[53:48] the where are the artists where are the
[53:50] local artists where's their work and uh
[53:52] I always love seeing that um yeah it's
[53:54] it's brilliant absolutely absolutely
[53:56] that's I never thought about that but
[53:58] yeah actually every conference I went to
[54:01] in 204 had some sort of Art Gallery
[54:04] usually at the entrance or somewhere at
[54:06] the main stage I love that yeah never
[54:09] thought about that perspective all we're
[54:10] missing right now
[54:12] is and I think I think AR is working on
[54:15] this is a um a stage show a Broadway
[54:20] style stage show play musical because
[54:25] we've got Bitcoin film that's been done
[54:27] uh documentaries have been done uh books
[54:31] obviously fiction and non-fiction have
[54:33] been done comic books have also been
[54:35] done as well there's some Bitcoin comic
[54:37] books out there kids books have been
[54:39] done uh YouTube videos podcasts audio's
[54:43] been done music's been done um poetry is
[54:47] poet is there Bitcoin poetry out there I
[54:49] think uh I mean some tweets I saw uh but
[54:52] I don't know if it's if it if does this
[54:56] uh is already poetry where you have like
[54:58] some short lines of some famous po but
[55:03] yeah like that's probably out there but
[55:05] I've not researched that actually so
[55:07] yeah artwork has been done statues have
[55:10] been done you know uh it's um it's
[55:14] really incredible to see so and and more
[55:18] of it please uh like you cannot you
[55:23] cannot stop this train people are going
[55:25] to bring their ideas to this there's a
[55:28] Bitcoin side at hello poetry so there
[55:31] you go there there there's there's some
[55:34] poetry philosophy has been done right
[55:37] the the amount of philosophizing that
[55:39] goes on around Bitcoin is is also great
[55:41] to see absolutely what what wish do you
[55:44] have for the community if you could wish
[55:46] something for the Bitcoin Community is
[55:48] there anything that you would wish
[55:51] for H H good question I don't think so I
[55:55] think we got this
[55:58] honestly uh I think we're exactly where
[56:01] we need to be Bitcoin is here more and
[56:04] more people are finding each
[56:06] day you know come what may uh no I I I I
[56:11] wouldn't I wouldn't wish for any change
[56:14] uh I think Bitcoin is and that's enough
[56:16] and we'll figure it out from there
[56:18] really cool um one question that I ask
[56:21] each and every one of my guests is what
[56:23] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[56:26] hm well I have a book called choose life
[56:30] which I wrote in
[56:33] 2017 and it's a book about how my wife
[56:37] and I come to
[56:39] the very difficult
[56:41] decision of me quitting my job getting
[56:45] out of my career taking our four kids
[56:48] out of school who were aged 8 six and
[56:50] two three-year-old twins at that time
[56:53] and leaving a country in which which we'
[56:56] lived had all of our
[56:59] children you know got married and we'
[57:01] lived there for 15 years and that was
[57:03] Singapore uh throw in the rental keys
[57:08] and at our landlord cancel the contract
[57:10] get on a plane and go start traveling
[57:12] with our kids and we did that for two
[57:14] and a half years the book is it's not a
[57:19] howto it's kind of like how we did and
[57:24] what I found since right it and
[57:26] releasing
[57:27] it actually what I found obviously I
[57:30] didn't realize this would ever happen
[57:33] when I wrote the book I was writing the
[57:35] book between 2015 2017 so I was going
[57:38] down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole I was going
[57:40] down the education homeschool unschool
[57:45] World School Rabbit Hole as well at the
[57:47] same time and we were living together
[57:52] the four of us from country to Country
[57:54] Home swap to home swap that's how we did
[57:56] it by the way we home swapped our way
[57:58] around the world so our accommodation
[58:00] costs were pretty much zero otherwise it
[58:01] would have been very very very costly to
[58:05] uh to you know rent Airbnb or hotel to
[58:08] to shelter six people uh but that's all
[58:11] explained in the book and uh what what I
[58:13] realized was you know we never felt more
[58:16] free ever and that that taste of Freedom
[58:21] once you felt it like you you didn't
[58:23] belong to any particular country you
[58:25] were just a Perpetual tourist and you
[58:28] had none of the everyday normal
[58:31] pressures on you and we I suddenly
[58:34] realized well this is actually life not
[58:37] what I was living before and a lot of
[58:40] people would tell me all right then you
[58:41] know you've done this now when you going
[58:42] to come back to real life and this is
[58:44] real life guys this is it like you know
[58:47] what the alternative is sitting at a
[58:50] desk 11 hours a day that's not life and
[58:56] being able to spend as much time with
[58:57] your family and do what you want when
[58:59] you want how you want and be left alone
[59:02] and have the freedom that's life and I
[59:05] just fell into that by mistake and I
[59:08] want other people to to taste that to to
[59:11] be able to do it and uh I just need to
[59:14] give them again social proof yeah I did
[59:16] it at the age of 38 with four kids and
[59:18] was married didn't go bankrupt didn't
[59:20] end up living under a bridge and so can
[59:22] you and people that have read the book
[59:24] have uh yeah they they've got a lot out
[59:27] of it and I get a lot of nice feedback
[59:29] funny enough the the best feedback I
[59:31] ever got was from a guy in Prague he
[59:34] come and found me when I was over at the
[59:36] the bookstand signing books and he said
[59:38] Daniel I read your book I'm oh yeah
[59:39] great thanks you know I hope you enjoyed
[59:42] it yeah I hated
[59:45] it okay uh always down for some feedback
[59:48] you know what was the problem he's like
[59:50] well it made me realize with every
[59:53] single page that you were completely
[59:56] destroying every single stupid
[59:59] excuse I'd been giving myself to not
[60:02] live this kind of life so I wanted to
[60:05] let you know that I quit my job I threw
[60:08] it in and I've been traveling for the
[60:11] last three months and here I am now in
[60:12] Prague and these are my plans I'm like
[60:14] wow that's that's amazing so I'm really
[60:17] glad that that people have found uh a
[60:20] lot of value from it and if if anybody
[60:23] didn't know about that book then you can
[60:25] go and get it from Bitcoin book. shop
[60:28] please don't go get it off Amazon go and
[60:31] get it off a Bitcoin book. shop because
[60:33] they are a Bitcoin company and you can
[60:35] pay in Bitcoin or FIA if you need to and
[60:38] you can use the code bitten and get a
[60:39] 10% discount but don't just buy that
[60:42] book like we said at the beginning it's
[60:43] all about education there are a ton of
[60:46] other books on there all Bitcoin books
[60:49] or Bitcoin related books get three or
[60:52] four like 40 50 bucks whatever it is you
[60:56] use the code bitten get that discount
[60:58] that $50 you spend at Bitcoin book. shop
[61:02] could change the rest of your life and
[61:05] people think about oh yeah I've got to
[61:07] go to education like we're talking got
[61:08] to go to university get my education get
[61:10] my degree it's going to cost me 50 Grand
[61:13] a year 200
[61:15] Grand or you could buy four bugs for 50
[61:18] bucks and completely change your life
[61:21] and end up living a much more fruitful
[61:23] life and gaining the conviction that you
[61:25] need need to gain uh in Bitcoin to be
[61:28] able to you know set yourself up for the
[61:31] future so yeah I would say that's it go
[61:34] pick up a book and it's available in
[61:35] English and in Spanish reading reading
[61:38] book is kind of a superpower you can
[61:40] really absorb information in a form nice
[61:45] conted way uh where it's yeah you can
[61:49] also do it without books but it will be
[61:51] a way harder life and you might not get
[61:54] to where you could have been with with
[61:57] some book and uh with some proper
[61:59] education with basically learning from
[62:00] other people's mistakes and from other
[62:02] people learning yeah it really really
[62:04] cool um I I guess this had a pretty huge
[62:07] impact on your family and probably it's
[62:09] really hard to say it in in like one
[62:12] answer what was what was like the the
[62:14] main impact it had on your family but
[62:16] maybe if you can try like what was the
[62:19] one thing that it really changed for for
[62:20] your whole
[62:22] family from doing the uh the traveling
[62:25] together uh yeah yeah uh we found the
[62:28] renewed faith in humanity that was
[62:30] incredible that was really wonderful and
[62:33] we all felt that because we were
[62:34] Perpetual tourists uh just blowing in
[62:37] the wind and turning up completely you
[62:42] know in as complete strangers uh and
[62:45] because we were home swapping as
[62:47] well uh we would be introduced we we so
[62:51] we'd stay in these people's houses uh
[62:54] whilst they were on holiday or sometimes
[62:56] it would be in a um like a small part of
[62:58] the house or they might have a house on
[63:00] the grounds and being completely taken
[63:03] in under people's wing and realizing
[63:07] that 99.9% of the people on this planet
[63:12] that we call human beings are incredibly
[63:16] wonderful kind generous honest people
[63:20] and I think this is what this is why we
[63:23] are driven so much to share this message
[63:26] of Bitcoin because we know it innately
[63:29] in us that everybody else is hurting in
[63:33] that other system and they can't get out
[63:36] of it and this is the escape hatch uh so
[63:39] that was the main thing yeah just been
[63:41] blown away by the friendliness of and in
[63:43] any country as well wherever we went uh
[63:47] we were just um yeah the amount of
[63:50] people that helped us in certain
[63:52] situations uh yeah just wonderful that
[63:55] that was one real great thing because up
[63:57] until that
[63:59] point H you know I 18 years in
[64:03] traditional financial markets you know I
[64:05] had a pretty low opinion of of
[64:08] [Laughter]
[64:10] people and renewed faith faith in people
[64:14] that in humanity that's that's great I
[64:16] love that really cool perfect then we
[64:19] have an uh Ender in the podcast uh it's
[64:22] it's a big change of pace that question
[64:25] uh the end routine of the podcast where
[64:26] the previous guest is asking a question
[64:28] for the next guest without knowing who
[64:30] the next guest actually is and your
[64:32] question from the previous guest is how
[64:34] many Bitcoin Will trump stack for the
[64:36] USA in the next four
[64:39] years it's a hard topic change yeah um
[64:44] well there's all of this talk about him
[64:48] uh setting up a Bitcoin Reserve right
[64:50] and uh whether he's going to sign the
[64:53] bill on his first day in office and all
[64:55] of this kind of stuff I mean I don't
[64:56] know I don't know and honestly it
[65:00] doesn't matter and then I the more
[65:02] philosophical kind of answer
[65:04] is how I mean how's it going to ever
[65:08] be owned like officially who's going to
[65:11] have those keys
[65:13] um so I yeah all right I I guess to kind
[65:16] of rephrase the question how many US
[65:18] Dollars will be converted into Bitcoin
[65:22] under
[65:23] Trump who knows man who knows a lot I
[65:28] guess uh because I do think I do think
[65:33] that they will do it
[65:36] yeah uh as you can see I don't spend too
[65:39] much time thinking about what
[65:40] politicians are going to do um probably
[65:43] a good idea yeah because they never do
[65:46] what they say that's for sure uh so yeah
[65:49] well let's wait and see let's wait and
[65:51] see sorry I couldn't be more specific I
[65:53] think that that answer is uh is great uh
[65:56] I I personally uh hope they're not
[65:58] buying a lot because I want people in
[66:01] PLS to buy Bitcoin and not nation states
[66:04] and and politicians but yeah uh thank
[66:07] you so much uh Daniel for for being on
