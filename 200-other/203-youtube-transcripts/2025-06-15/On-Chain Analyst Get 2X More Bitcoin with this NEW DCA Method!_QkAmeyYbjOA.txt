[00:00] there's only one thing I like more than
[00:01] Bitcoin and it's more Bitcoins I do
[00:03] think we can outperform Bitcoin that's a
[00:05] pretty hard Baseline to be you know
[00:06] we're talking hundreds of percent per
[00:08] year potentially if we can basically
[00:09] double or triple that with just a couple
[00:11] trades every few years then that's
[00:13] pretty preferable there is allocations
[00:14] that I am using to actively try and
[00:17] accumulate more BTC we've now built a
[00:19] solid foundational base and we've
[00:21] already proven that 100K can be broken
[00:23] quite easily once the macroeconomic
[00:25] conditions become more favorable the sky
[00:26] is really the limit for BTC we've seen
[00:28] what $37 billion of net inflows that's
[00:31] over 10 times the inflows gold saw in
[00:33] its first year of its us ETF launch and
[00:35] everyone looks at the gold price action
[00:37] in the Years following that launch and
[00:38] that fractal where gold ran up
[00:40] exponentially for multiple years Bitcoin
[00:42] could be on the cusp of that 25 does
[00:44] have the potential to be something
[00:46] spectacular like we've never seen before
[00:48] especially looking at the onchain data
[00:50] this isn't an opportunity that comes
[00:51] around very often an asset that we've
[00:53] all had access to there's not many
[00:55] assets where retail can get in before
[00:57] these big institutional players
[01:00] [Music]
[01:03] on chain data you're you're the second
[01:05] person I ever talked on the podcast
[01:07] which is uh I feel I feel like this
[01:10] topic should be more popular on the
[01:12] podcast I talked with checkmaid you
[01:14] probably know him uh and you another
[01:18] second episode now I can make a playlist
[01:20] with unchain data on my channel uh with
[01:23] with unchain data so thank you so much
[01:24] for taking time and coming on today no
[01:27] of course thanks for having me and and
[01:28] checkmates obviously one of the best
[01:30] Minds in the space so the bar set pretty
[01:31] high for me today to try and give some
[01:33] unique onchain insights and try and
[01:35] educate the audience on maybe what we do
[01:38] and how we can help your own investing
[01:39] and Analysis but yeah just as a little
[01:41] bit of background as who I am I'm Matt
[01:43] from Bitcoin magazine Pro where the data
[01:46] and analytics branch of Bitcoin magazine
[01:48] who are the oldest and most established
[01:50] Bitcoin publication on the web and we
[01:52] host the Bitcoin conferences and stuff
[01:54] like that and yeah we we only really
[01:57] partnered with Bitcoin magazine our
[01:59] onchain day platform which used to be
[02:01] called look to bitcoin earlier in 2024 I
[02:03] think it was June or July time and since
[02:06] then yeah we've been able to kind of
[02:07] expand our reach and provide more and
[02:09] more data and analytics as well as macro
[02:11] data and portfolio tools Etc just to
[02:14] really try and simplify you're investing
[02:16] not only from a performance standpoint
[02:19] but also just from a time and
[02:21] understanding standpoint I feel like a
[02:23] lot of onchain data gets a reputation of
[02:25] being incredibly complicated and
[02:28] unnecessarily so there's there's so many
[02:30] charts you can look at which really
[02:31] paint a picture in black and white of
[02:33] what is happening in the market are we
[02:34] in a bull cycle bare cycle we close to a
[02:36] peak or bottom and from there it just
[02:39] yeah as I said Can massively save you
[02:41] time and improve your own investing by
[02:43] removing that emotional bias by just
[02:45] purely looking at date driven approach
[02:47] to yeah try and outperform a vast
[02:49] majority of people H in the end it's
[02:51] it's all about getting more Bitcoin I
[02:54] guess right exactly I I like to say
[02:56] there's only one thing I like more than
[02:58] Bitcoin and it's more Bitcoin so I know
[03:00] it's a slightly controversial take with
[03:02] people in the space but I'm openly going
[03:04] to say this cycle I will be selling
[03:07] Bitcoin in hopes that next cycle I can
[03:09] buy even more Bitcoin I don't know about
[03:11] you guys but I I I work in Bitcoin space
[03:14] full-time so obviously I earn a lot of
[03:17] uh my salary in Bitcoin and stuff like
[03:19] that but the best way to actually
[03:21] increase my stack will be to try and
[03:23] time scaling out of the market towards a
[03:24] cycle Peak and then towards the cycle
[03:26] bottom after a 60 70 plus perc draw down
[03:29] potenti
[03:30] that scaling back in is going to
[03:31] massively outpace salary and any other
[03:34] small trades I make because that macro
[03:36] part of my investing portfolio yeah if
[03:39] we can basically double or triple that
[03:41] with just a couple trades every few
[03:42] years then that's you know pretty
[03:44] preferable interesting what what do you
[03:46] think is the probably impossible to
[03:50] guess exactly but what do you think is
[03:52] the percentage change of how many more
[03:54] Bitcoin you can probably get if you are
[03:58] are good in this and if you actually uh
[04:01] try to to to learn from the onchain data
[04:04] did you uh had some or did you run with
[04:07] your own uh DCA strategy analysis of
[04:11] like what would you get if you just
[04:13] stack every month versus what you have
[04:15] now so it's it's a very good question I
[04:17] think a lot of this also comes down to
[04:19] personal preference I for example like
[04:22] to spend as little time as possible in
[04:24] front of the charts so I can be someone
[04:26] that can scale in and then every few
[04:27] months maybe take a swing trade or so
[04:29] but then scale out quite heavily
[04:31] potentially two or three years after
[04:32] I've really heavily accumulated whereas
[04:34] we get a lot of people who use onchain
[04:36] data because again it's not just
[04:37] something that we can look at on a macro
[04:39] basis to say right I buy in 2021 and
[04:42] then I wait you know years or so to to
[04:45] sell you get people that are using this
[04:46] onchain data on an intraday time frame
[04:49] who are looking at buys and sells from
[04:52] Big accounts as they're happening in
[04:54] real time all that really drives the
[04:55] market is supply and demand economics
[04:57] and using this onchain data we can see
[04:59] people selling and buying Bitcoin as it
[05:01] happens so they may be making 5 to 10
[05:04] trades a day in which case our returns
[05:06] might be slightly different at least
[05:07] that Equity curve might be slightly
[05:09] different but I do like to think as a
[05:11] baseline using this onchain data I do
[05:14] think we can outperform Bitcoin which is
[05:16] a pretty strong Baseline considering
[05:18] Bitcoin is one of the best performing
[05:20] assets globally in the last decade going
[05:22] from you know a few hundred a decade ago
[05:25] to over $100,000 pretty much to where we
[05:28] are today that's pretty hard Baseline to
[05:30] be you know we're talking hundreds of
[05:31] percent per year potentially and if we
[05:34] can outperform that with just a few
[05:35] trades because obviously then you have
[05:37] to consider taxes funding fees slippage
[05:40] Etc that's all going to be a detriment
[05:42] on performance but as a baseline I think
[05:44] using this onchain data and taking an
[05:46] unbiased risk managed approach I think
[05:49] you can outperform just buy and hold
[05:51] which yeah as I said is a pretty hard
[05:52] Baseline to beat but we do have quite
[05:55] extensive research showing that this is
[05:57] possible and the reason I got into
[05:59] unchain data and analytics to begin with
[06:01] is because that's what I heavily relied
[06:03] on over the previous cycle to again make
[06:05] up for the mistakes I made when I first
[06:08] got into Bitcoin I'm not sure about
[06:09] yourself but when I first got into
[06:11] Bitcoin and I was learning about trading
[06:13] and investing and I was in trading view
[06:15] every day with a thousand different
[06:16] lines on my charts and 50 different
[06:18] indicators trying to find the Holy Grail
[06:20] massively over complicating things I
[06:22] ended up buying the top selling the
[06:23] bottom like most people do it was only
[06:25] after that where I really deep dived
[06:27] into Bitcoin its technology the
[06:29] blockchain everything beyond that and
[06:31] realize we can actually see all of this
[06:33] transaction going on we can see all of
[06:34] the movement on chain we can see these
[06:36] experienced large players begin to
[06:38] accumulate and distribute their coins as
[06:40] it's happening we can just follow them
[06:42] we don't have to have an edge that's you
[06:45] know so unique and complicated we can
[06:47] just wait until the best most profitable
[06:49] Traders are selling and sell alongside
[06:51] them or see when they're accumulating
[06:52] and accumulate alongside them as well
[06:54] and so I'm a big proprietor of using
[06:56] this data because I have the evidence
[06:58] from myself that it worked in the prev
[06:59] previous cycle and then since then since
[07:01] I kind of made this my job to to try and
[07:04] educate people on on chain data and the
[07:06] the topic of Bitcoin we were
[07:08] accumulating heavily around the $ 15 to
[07:10] $19,000 region the previous cycle lows
[07:13] we've had now when we reached $74,000 we
[07:16] were already identifying that we may be
[07:18] a little bit overheated and having a bit
[07:19] of a cool off and now above 100K we're
[07:21] getting a few signs that maybe on the
[07:23] short term that prices maybe
[07:24] overextended a little bit but we have
[07:26] had a few weeks to cool off so it's
[07:28] really interesting to see how this all
[07:29] kind of Confluence merges together to
[07:31] give us not just a big picture on a
[07:33] multicycle multi-year basis but also in
[07:36] these swing micro swing micro sorry
[07:39] Incycle moves are you doing this with
[07:43] only with a significant amount of your
[07:46] stack uh or with only a a small amount
[07:49] of your stack to keep the risk lower so
[07:52] personally I have a few different
[07:54] allocations of my portfolio so I even
[07:57] have my own pension pot in bit bit coin
[08:00] which is uh pretty out there I managed
[08:01] to get that in in 2018 so that's an
[08:03] amount of Bitcoin that I won't be able
[08:04] to touch for decades so this isn't like
[08:07] I'm selling and accumulating with 100%
[08:09] of my Bitcoin there's a certain amount
[08:11] that I'm never going to touch there's a
[08:12] certain amount which I'm dcing with
[08:14] which is like I said through salaries
[08:15] and whatnot there's a certain amount
[08:17] which I won't touch for decades but then
[08:19] there is allocations that I am using to
[08:21] actively try and accumulate more BTC
[08:24] which it's hard to give exact
[08:26] percentages but if you imagine almost a
[08:28] 33% one third one third one third split
[08:31] a third you're never really touching a
[08:32] third you're adding to and then a third
[08:34] you're maybe actively trying to increase
[08:37] your stack by going into the market at
[08:39] the most opportune moments and trying to
[08:41] sell at the most opportune moments
[08:44] interesting um a question that I
[08:46] probably should have asked uh in in the
[08:48] beginning of the show um for the few
[08:52] people that maybe don't know uh what
[08:54] exactly is Onin data and what insights
[08:57] can we really get from there if if maybe
[08:59] someone is wondering now yeah we maybe
[09:02] should have started with this so really
[09:05] quickly on chain data Bitcoin is built
[09:07] on top of a blockchain which means every
[09:09] transaction is publicly available we can
[09:11] see every transaction we can see every
[09:13] wallet and we can see in real time what
[09:15] they're doing what trades they're making
[09:16] the SES the transfers Etc and what we
[09:19] can do with that data is essentially
[09:21] form a picture of what the supply and
[09:23] demand economics of the Bitcoin Market
[09:25] are in real time we can see if lots of
[09:28] like I said previously
[09:29] large long-term experienced Traders are
[09:32] beginning to transfer some BTC at the
[09:34] tail end of bull cycles and historically
[09:36] we can monitor these wallets to say wow
[09:38] they are pretty good at timing the
[09:39] market we can take some inspiration from
[09:41] those but essentially all it is is just
[09:43] collating every single one of these
[09:45] transactions and then we can manipulate
[09:46] that data in certain ways to help our
[09:49] own trading and investing depending on
[09:51] like I said if you're a long-term
[09:52] investor a DC someone who's just
[09:54] interested someone who's actively day
[09:56] trading but yeah I mean if you at the US
[10:00] economy for example when they're looking
[10:02] at all of the transactions based on well
[10:05] cash is harder to track but in the
[10:06] digital money movements that gives them
[10:09] a huge amount of insight into what they
[10:10] can do with inflationary rates Etc but
[10:13] we don't have that data publicly
[10:14] available this is where Bitcoin is quite
[10:16] unique in that everyone has access to
[10:18] this data freely all you need is a
[10:19] Bitcoin nerd to spin it all up or if you
[10:21] use a platform like ours where you can
[10:23] see all of this data nicely visualized
[10:26] so then you can help make your own
[10:27] decisions based on that interesting
[10:28] really cool um what are maybe we can
[10:31] start off with uh some of your charts or
[10:34] metrics uh right now what are the most
[10:37] important ones that that you look at and
[10:39] and uh why are they important what what
[10:42] insights are you basically gaining from
[10:44] them yeah great so I'll just share this
[10:47] one which is probably our most popular
[10:49] chart we have on the site which is the
[10:52] mvrv Z SC so you only need to really
[10:54] know one component of this and then the
[10:56] rest of it kind of makes a little bit of
[10:57] sense so first and foremost if I just
[10:59] remove this orange line and the Bitcoin
[11:02] price action is what we see this black
[11:03] line here this is the market cap so the
[11:05] circulating supply of Bitcoin just
[11:07] multiplied by the price and this blue
[11:09] line here is the realized cap now the
[11:12] realized price is the average
[11:14] accumulation price or the cost basis of
[11:16] all BTC on the network so what we can do
[11:19] is basically aggregate every single
[11:21] Bitcoin transaction that's ever happened
[11:23] look at the USD value of BTC at that
[11:26] point in time assume that that transfer
[11:28] was either accumula or sale of BTC and
[11:31] then once we get all of that again we
[11:32] can multiply that by the circulating
[11:34] Supply to give us the realized cap which
[11:36] is if you want to look at the average
[11:38] purchase point of every BTC hodler but
[11:41] this is just in market cap terms so once
[11:43] we have that we can just simply divide
[11:45] the market cap by this realized cap to
[11:47] give us the mvrv and then we standardize
[11:50] that data over uh depending on its
[11:52] volatility throughout bitcoin's history
[11:54] to give us the mvrv Z score so that
[11:57] sounds pretty complicated but for those
[11:59] that can see the chat currently what
[12:01] we're seeing is this Orange Line
[12:02] representing the mvrb Z score shows us
[12:05] when Bitcoin is incredibly increased in
[12:07] terms of its percentage Above This
[12:09] average accumulation price so people are
[12:11] in two three four five times profit
[12:13] based on the average cost basis of all
[12:16] BTC holders and once we get further down
[12:18] here beneath a value of zero which would
[12:21] indicate a majority of Bitcoin is
[12:23] currently being held at a loss now what
[12:25] we can see with a lot of onchain data is
[12:28] this is essentially just Mass psychology
[12:30] Quantified that's all it is all we're
[12:31] seeing is in real time if people are
[12:34] bullish incredibly greedy Etc or fearful
[12:38] wanting to sell what we can see is when
[12:40] most people are at to sell this is
[12:42] counterintuitive to human emotion to
[12:44] want to accumulate into an asset which
[12:46] you may be holding at a loss but what we
[12:48] can see from this is when a majority of
[12:50] people are at a loss once we're in this
[12:52] green zone on this chart that signifies
[12:54] the most opportune risk reward moment to
[12:57] begin heavily accumulating BC what we
[13:00] can see in the previous cycle the
[13:02] previous bare Market in towards the tail
[13:03] end of 2022 this basically crossed
[13:06] beneath this average accumulation price
[13:08] it we're looking at the market cap here
[13:10] rather than the price but it was around
[13:12] $20,000 all the way down to about
[13:14] $155,000 and on that runup we had in
[13:16] January 2023 a couple years ago now at
[13:19] that point we crossed back above and
[13:21] that almost signified the start of this
[13:22] bull cycle and what we can see is in
[13:24] previous Cycles once we get to these
[13:26] incredibly High values once a vast
[13:28] majority of people are making excessive
[13:30] gains unrealized gains when people are
[13:33] taking screenshots of their p&l and
[13:34] sending it to friends and people are
[13:36] thoing in this is when you really want
[13:38] to be looking to take some risk off the
[13:40] table when you maybe want to be locking
[13:42] in some profit which again is hard to do
[13:44] in that moment when you see your
[13:46] portfolio has made a 5x or even a 10x or
[13:49] something this isn't a moment in time
[13:51] where you need to think to yourself oh
[13:53] yeah maybe now's the time to stop that
[13:55] that's so counterintuitive to feel you
[13:57] want to put more money on the table into
[13:59] an asset that's making you this much
[14:01] profit but this is where these data
[14:02] charts can can really help to see you
[14:05] know this these patterns are somewhat
[14:07] predictable we can see throughout
[14:08] history once x amount of profit has been
[14:10] reached by a majority of investors this
[14:12] is usually when the Market's getting a
[14:14] little overheated and the same for the
[14:15] downside like I said once a majority of
[14:18] people are at a loss on their positions
[14:19] it's usually a good idea to do the
[14:21] opposite and start accumulating when
[14:22] other people are
[14:24] Distributing I like the idea of um a
[14:29] weighted DCA of like more targed dcing
[14:33] where you see when you see the data and
[14:35] you're like okay here uh we are most
[14:38] likely at some sort of bottom so I'm
[14:41] trying to buy in with more uh and trying
[14:45] to buy a little bit heavier here and if
[14:47] we are more up I'm I'm trying to not buy
[14:51] in as much as I
[14:52] can with selling I feel like there's a a
[14:56] risk of like what if we hit a weird like
[15:01] do bubble point where all of the sudden
[15:03] all the prices completely shoot up yes
[15:06] there's a uh argument it probably will
[15:08] come down but what if it doesn't come
[15:10] down um I I guess that's that that's the
[15:14] that's the there are some risks uh to
[15:16] that even though the chart already 15
[15:19] years is kind of predictable what are
[15:22] you saying to like um what if we shoot
[15:25] up to too much in like maybe a strategic
[15:28] Reserve National Bank uh for more
[15:32] situation of course and and that's a
[15:34] definitely a Hot Topic at the minute I
[15:37] remember in the previous cycle we also
[15:38] had discussions of what if we see a
[15:40] Bitcoin super cycle or something like
[15:42] that but I still stand by the number one
[15:44] thing that's actually moving markets
[15:46] moving the Bitcoin price is supply and
[15:48] demand economics obviously we see a US
[15:51] strategic Reserve launched and that's a
[15:53] million Bitcoin that needs to be
[15:54] accumulated that's a huge increase in
[15:56] demand and Supply is staying pretty
[15:58] stagnant we're not seeing a huge amount
[16:00] of new Bitcoin floting into the markets
[16:02] every day so that 1 million Bitcoin is
[16:03] going to have to be bought at
[16:05] considerably higher prices than the
[16:06] current market whatever people are
[16:08] willing to sell at but ultimately the
[16:10] thing that is going to determine when
[16:11] the top is in is when people are selling
[16:13] and demand isn't increasing to match
[16:15] that so if I can share another metric
[16:18] here that may be uh good to show let's
[16:21] do it great two SE uh there we go so
[16:25] this is a great metric that's going to
[16:28] help me try and time the top and again
[16:30] it's it's always going to be impossible
[16:32] to sell 100% of your position at the
[16:34] exact Market Peak but what we can do is
[16:36] see periods where there is some sign
[16:39] signals that we're getting a little
[16:40] overheated so this is the value days
[16:42] destroyed multiple and as we can see it
[16:45] just shows very cool periods here and
[16:47] very hot periods when this metric gets
[16:49] red which has historically signaled
[16:51] pretty major peaks in the Bitcoin price
[16:52] Action Now what this is doing is
[16:55] actually waiting the transfer of Bitcoin
[16:59] uh also known as the coin days destroyed
[17:01] by the amount of BTC being transferred
[17:03] and the amount of time being held so
[17:04] that might sound a little complicated
[17:06] but essentially if I held one BTC for a
[17:08] 100 days and then transferred it to cell
[17:11] I would add 100 coin days destroyed if I
[17:13] held not 0.1 BTC for a thousand days it
[17:16] would equal the same thing so what this
[17:18] is doing is when we see traders who have
[17:19] been holding BTC for a very extended
[17:22] period of time who have maybe held
[17:23] Bitcoin since it was just a few hundred
[17:25] doar or even less for many many many
[17:27] years once we see these begin to start
[17:30] selling that's a huge amount of Supply
[17:32] flooding the market and you have to
[17:34] consider once bitcoin's price is at
[17:36] 100,000 plus maybe we Peak at $150
[17:38] $200,000 who knows the amount of capital
[17:41] inflows required to actually scoop up
[17:43] that amount of BTC entering the market
[17:46] is substantial compared to the amount of
[17:48] BTS uh USD sorry required to purchase
[17:51] that Bitcoin years and years ago it's an
[17:53] incredible amount of capital inflow
[17:55] required so of course if we see a
[17:57] strategic reserve the market market
[17:59] dynamics change a little bit but it's
[18:00] hard to base our strategy on if buts and
[18:04] maybe so far what we can see from the
[18:06] data is such as when we peaked in March
[18:09] February 2024 this was incredibly High
[18:12] when we reached the first alltime high
[18:14] around 73 74,000 we saw a huge amount of
[18:17] profit taking by long-term holders and
[18:19] then following that we saw seven months
[18:21] of pretty stagnant choppy consolidation
[18:23] price action and the same is true for
[18:25] pretty much all of the Bitcoin Peaks
[18:27] what we can see is when lots of people
[18:29] are selling that usually indicates a
[18:31] market top especially those who have a
[18:33] lot of BTC accumulated at lower prices
[18:35] so of course selling at the top is going
[18:37] to be incredibly difficult but this is
[18:39] why such as scaling in at the bottom
[18:41] people like to dollar cost average in
[18:42] like you said if we can strategically
[18:44] dollar cost average in metrics like this
[18:46] can help us strategically dollar cost
[18:48] average out but the thing with Bitcoin
[18:50] is there's typically a long periods of
[18:52] time where there's not a whole lot
[18:54] happening during a most most of
[18:57] bitcoin's price action you probably want
[18:59] to be quite stagnant so I've just zoomed
[19:01] on the price section here if you were
[19:03] able to accumulate quite heavily between
[19:05] 20,000 to $15,000 at the tail end of the
[19:08] last bear cycle yeah maybe you're taking
[19:10] some profit 74,000 and slightly Bel
[19:13] $100,000 but once we look at other
[19:15] metrics for Confluence alongside
[19:17] something like the value days destroyed
[19:18] the mvrv Z scar Etc we kind of get a
[19:21] better idea of when start scaling out
[19:23] and that might be a couple years after
[19:25] but then hopefully you've scaled out
[19:27] sufficiently enough obviously you're
[19:28] never going to sell 100% at the exact
[19:30] Peak but just enough so that in a couple
[19:32] years time again once where the tail end
[19:33] of the next B cycle you have enough
[19:35] Capital to reaccumulate considerably
[19:37] more than what you started with it's
[19:40] almost like onent data kind of mirrors
[19:43] the human psychology between buying and
[19:46] selling and the and the free market
[19:49] dynamics yeah of course of course and I
[19:51] think like I said there there's quite a
[19:52] lot of indications that this data is
[19:55] really pointing towards the
[19:57] counterintuitive nature of Bitcoin and
[20:00] investing in general and just the human
[20:02] psychology with this looking at
[20:04] something like the fear and greed index
[20:05] which is one of the most popular kind of
[20:08] technical charts people look at to kind
[20:09] of gauge sentiment in the market once we
[20:11] see an incredibly overly greedy
[20:13] sentiment this is when a lot of retail
[20:15] coming in who maybe aren't experienced
[20:17] are wanting to FM a win they're not
[20:20] selling BTC they're feeling greedy at
[20:21] that period of time this is where we can
[20:23] see the Divergence between these large
[20:25] and more experienced traders who are
[20:27] taking profit and scaling out that
[20:28] period of time compared to these new
[20:30] capital rushing in and same is true for
[20:32] the downside once we see people flooding
[20:34] out saying that you know we're going to
[20:35] crash to 10K 1K even after 10 15
[20:39] retracement 15% retracement sorry now
[20:42] we're already seeing people saying you
[20:43] know 50k 60k could be possible in the
[20:46] next few weeks realistically this is
[20:48] just human immersion getting the better
[20:50] of people when actually if we're looking
[20:52] at data we're actually seeing a decrease
[20:54] in the amount of profit taken currently
[20:56] and especially with the ETF inflows that
[20:58] we're seeing we're seeing demand start
[20:59] to scoop up that excess Supply hopefully
[21:01] building a solid foundation for the next
[21:03] leg higher interesting um how big of an
[21:07] effect does the overall monetary
[21:10] expansion and the M2 money supply and
[21:12] all those things uh come come into play
[21:15] uh with onchain data are there any
[21:17] correlations uh between the onchain data
[21:19] and M2 money supply yes so I have just
[21:24] the chat for you once again if I can
[21:26] just uh screen share here just give me
[21:28] two seconds what we have here is the
[21:30] global M2 versus BTC year onye chat now
[21:34] of all of the macroeconomic data points
[21:37] this is one that has almost exactly a
[21:39] onetoone correlation when we see massive
[21:41] expansion in global central banks
[21:44] balance sheets and just general money
[21:46] printers going we typically see Bitcoin
[21:49] massively appreciating in value also and
[21:51] the same is true for the downside once
[21:53] we see a contraction once we see the
[21:54] money printers going down and we see
[21:56] governments maybe tightening it up a
[21:58] little bit due to fears of a recession
[22:00] or something like that is usually when
[22:01] we see bitcoin's worse periods of
[22:03] performance and this chart really
[22:05] outlines that if you were to just look
[22:07] at one e macroeconomic data point for
[22:10] your Bitcoin investing it would probably
[22:11] be this one what we can see is as soon
[22:13] as we see expansion such as in 2017
[22:17] following the inauguration of trump in
[22:18] his first presidential term we saw
[22:21] Bitcoin rally exponentially starting it
[22:23] just a 176% year-on-year gains before a
[22:27] few months later to being two and a half
[22:29] thousand nearly percent year on-year
[22:30] gains and this liquidity cycle is pretty
[22:34] interesting because either
[22:35] coincidentally or due to some genius
[22:38] policies from Satoshi this has coincided
[22:41] very nicely with the fouryear cycle we
[22:43] typically see in Bitcoin partly due to
[22:45] the Haring events where we see the
[22:46] Bitcoin inflationary rate drop by 50%
[22:50] historically that is also aligned pretty
[22:52] nicely with this Global liquidity cycle
[22:54] so we get these big massively increased
[22:56] bull markets just due to the fact that
[22:58] there's more Fiat currencies flooding
[23:00] into the system more and more dry powder
[23:02] again we see the supply of dollars
[23:04] increasing with the demand of dollars
[23:06] decreasing they're looking for hard
[23:07] assets like BTC try and scoop up a
[23:10] little bit of
[23:11] performance I I was re I was kind of
[23:14] disappointed with the price movements
[23:16] around the 100K dollar Mark I I expected
[23:19] more I expected not only more from the
[23:21] price I thought like okay if we reach
[23:23] the 100K we we might overshoot uh but I
[23:27] definitely expected more from
[23:29] um what what Norm is uh outside of of
[23:32] the Bitcoin Community really F of
[23:35] Bitcoin and maybe kind of uh more
[23:37] Euphoria but I feel like it was mostly
[23:40] in the in the Bitcoin crowd um what did
[23:42] you see during that time Bitcoin bred at
[23:46] 100K and since now like dancing around
[23:49] like sometimes you were like at 102k
[23:51] then 93k again and we're dancing around
[23:54] that that 100K number yeah I I to be
[23:58] honest I was pretty much the same I
[23:59] imagined 100K would this be would be
[24:02] this big psychological barrier where
[24:03] maybe it' take longer to break through I
[24:05] was already surprised that how easily
[24:06] that 100K resistance fell it only took a
[24:09] matter of weeks from being only you know
[24:11] 60 70k in new alltime highs to breaking
[24:14] into six figure territory to me that was
[24:16] mind-blowing but again I also agree I I
[24:18] shared the same sentiment that I thought
[24:19] it would be major headline news Bitcoin
[24:21] break ,000 but the reason I think it
[24:24] maybe didn't is because we're maybe
[24:25] again seeing macroeconomic conditions
[24:27] that aren't 100% favorable so what we
[24:30] can see is we have seen the global M2
[24:32] money supply since around September
[24:34] actually Contracting which one outlines
[24:37] bitcoin's strength to be able to Rally
[24:38] quite exponentially during period of
[24:40] less than favorable macroeconomic
[24:42] conditions but also makes me pretty
[24:44] bullish on what Bitcoin can do once we
[24:46] see this trend reverse again just
[24:48] because we're seeing a slight
[24:49] contraction in the M2 money supply now
[24:51] doesn't mean that the liquidity cycle is
[24:53] over what we can see is in pretty much
[24:55] every liquidity cycle we have periods
[24:57] where it's you know cusing buffering
[24:59] Contracting slightly but there also ties
[25:01] in with a chart like this which is
[25:04] Bitcoin versus the US dollar generally
[25:08] investor sentiment in traditional
[25:09] markets I know the S&P is doing pretty
[25:11] well but there's still a little bit
[25:13] hesitation I feel and that's due one in
[25:16] partly due to the contraction in the
[25:17] money supply but also the rally in
[25:19] strength in assets like the US dollar
[25:22] what we can see is the dxy here the US
[25:24] dollar strength index has again been
[25:26] massively rallying since around SE
[25:28] September time as Bitcoin ran from what
[25:30] we can see on the chart around
[25:32] $65,000 to above $100,000 again
[25:35] outlining the strength of BTC to be able
[25:37] to Rally that high after a period of
[25:39] choppy consolidation in spite of less
[25:42] than favorable macroeconomic conditions
[25:44] and again this is one of those charts
[25:46] which this isn't going to keep Rising
[25:47] forever of course this may be causing
[25:50] some limited upside potential for BTC
[25:52] and causing a little bit of this
[25:53] stagnation beneath the $100,000 but once
[25:56] this does turn we've now built a solid
[25:58] foundational base and we've already
[26:00] proven that 100K can be broken quite
[26:02] easily so once the Macar come sorry got
[26:05] lost in my what is there once the
[26:07] macroeconomic conditions become more
[26:09] favorable the sky is really the limit
[26:11] for
[26:11] BTC interesting it's it's
[26:15] also this next coming year is um for me
[26:20] kind of a a joker year where we might
[26:23] have something really incredible in
[26:25] terms of adoption and especially also
[26:27] price development it's a kind of
[26:29] scoreboard of the adoption and how bad
[26:31] fear is doing what do you expect of this
[26:34] next coming years I'm maybe just to
[26:38] summarize we have a potential s
[26:40] strategic Bitcoin Reserve In America
[26:42] which will probably trigger some other
[26:44] countries to at least announce things or
[26:47] do something in the background bricks
[26:49] are talking about that Russia was
[26:51] talking about that uh lower interest
[26:53] rates money printing with with Trump in
[26:55] office and want to push the market uh to
[26:59] to hire ETFs now one year in full swing
[27:02] all those the ETFs a lot of people were
[27:05] in the beginning a little bit
[27:06] disappointed I think uh it was an
[27:08] amazing start but the all those
[27:11] marketing and and sales machines from
[27:13] the ETF providers they really come in
[27:15] full swing I think in the f after 12
[27:17] months where they have already one year
[27:19] of data and the the year was really uh
[27:22] really good and companies buying what do
[27:24] you expect from 2095 what you see on
[27:27] chain but also what's just going on in
[27:29] the
[27:30] macroand it's hard not to get carried
[27:33] away with how bullish things could get
[27:35] in 2025 I feel like you've said with the
[27:38] ETFs a potential us strategic Reserve
[27:40] we're seeing a massive shift in Bitcoin
[27:43] whereas in you know the 2016 2017 cycle
[27:46] my first cycle in the space it was
[27:48] almost entirely retail driven and then
[27:51] following that in 2020 we had these
[27:53] exchanges and institutions like FTX and
[27:56] 3ac leveraging up and trying to pump
[27:58] Bitcoin but this cycle we're actually
[28:00] getting this institutional demand and
[28:02] inflows the first year since the Bitcoin
[28:05] ETFs launched it was pretty much a year
[28:06] ago to the day as we filmed this we've
[28:08] seen what 37 billion dollars of net
[28:10] inflows that's over 10 times the inflows
[28:12] gold saw in its first year of its us ETF
[28:15] launch and everyone looks at the gold
[28:17] price action the years following that
[28:18] launch and that fractal where gold ran
[28:21] up exponentially for multiple years
[28:23] Bitcoin could be on the cusp of that
[28:25] especially with corporations like micro
[28:27] strategy accumul in and other companies
[28:29] will inevitably try and follow and
[28:31] repeat that success we are seeing lots
[28:33] of players coming into the space who
[28:35] truly understand the potential of a
[28:37] scarce asset like Bitcoin not just as a
[28:40] store of value but potentially something
[28:42] as a international settlement product
[28:45] where we could see Nations obviously El
[28:47] salbador have already begun accumulating
[28:49] but like you said if we've seen nation
[28:51] states already begin accumulating BTC in
[28:53] the background potentially even
[28:55] exchanging International settlements
[28:57] using BTC then yeah 2025 does have the
[29:01] potential to be something spectacular
[29:03] like we've never seen before especially
[29:06] looking at the onchain data as well we
[29:08] are beginning to see people maybe
[29:09] realizing that the amount of selling
[29:11] we've seen onchain has reduced
[29:12] dramatically over the past few weeks of
[29:14] people maybe realize this isn't an
[29:17] opportunity that comes around very often
[29:19] an asset that you know we've all had
[29:21] access to there's not many assets where
[29:23] retail can get in before these big
[29:25] institutional players and this is that
[29:27] opportunity and the opportunity cost of
[29:29] taking profit now when the upside
[29:31] potential is seemingly infinite just
[29:33] seems crazy so yes I'm incredibly
[29:35] bullish for 2025 but as alongside that I
[29:39] do try to not get incredibly carried
[29:41] away I do try and have a 95% data
[29:45] focused approach because as much as I
[29:47] look at these charts every day
[29:49] practically and have been in the space
[29:50] for multiple years like I said it's
[29:53] impossible not to get carried away with
[29:54] this type of thing so as bullish as I am
[29:57] as hopeful as I I can be on BTC once the
[30:00] warning sign signs start flashing once
[30:02] we do see ETF inflows begin drying up
[30:05] once we do see large whales begin
[30:08] selling in bulk at that point it does
[30:11] make sense to start scaling out even in
[30:13] spite of potentially incredibly bullish
[30:15] narratives I partnered up with coin
[30:18] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:21] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[30:24] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[30:27] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[30:29] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[30:32] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[30:35] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[30:38] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[30:41] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:44] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:47] watch collections you have the date of
[30:50] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:53] there and of course also the block
[30:55] height and which EPO we are currently in
[30:59] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:02] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:04] check out those amazing coin viland time
[31:07] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[31:10] those watches so so much if you watch or
[31:13] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:16] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:18] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[31:20] is to keep their Bitcoin keep them
[31:23] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:26] recommendation for Hardware wallet is is
[31:28] the bit box it's super secure it's
[31:30] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[31:32] for a friend who has still the Bitcoin
[31:35] on an exchange and you can get a 5%
[31:38] discount with the code Robin at the
[31:40] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss SL
[31:44] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[31:47] step is to really level up your
[31:49] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[31:52] have the most secure self custody setup
[31:54] you have to secure your own devices you
[31:58] have to protect your privacy you have to
[32:00] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[32:03] on where you live you even want to have
[32:05] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[32:08] move in case something goes really
[32:10] really wrong and through all those steps
[32:12] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[32:15] step by step and if you visit the
[32:17] Bitcoin way.com
[32:19] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[32:22] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:25] level up your sovereignty wait so you've
[32:28] seen uh selling actually decreasing uh
[32:32] over the last couple of weeks which is
[32:35] super interesting that we I think a lot
[32:37] of people see 100K as a natural top if
[32:39] they don't understand Bitcoin but
[32:41] probably a lot of people that are in
[32:42] Bitcoin understand it uh so the struggle
[32:45] that we have right now between like 105k
[32:49] and 93k whatever we are uh is more
[32:53] around the M2 money supply
[32:56] being not shot up up and being a little
[32:58] bit uh um smaller down and not the
[33:04] people selling is is that correct yeah
[33:07] so I mean I can share a chart here which
[33:09] can maybe back that up a little bit once
[33:13] again just two SE and I'm sharing a
[33:14] chart here which is the long-term holder
[33:17] supply of BTC now I've zoomed in just on
[33:19] our current cycle and what this is
[33:21] showing is the amount of BTC that has
[33:22] been held by these longer more
[33:25] experienced potentially BTC hold ERS now
[33:29] what this usually has is an inverse
[33:30] correlation with price once we see this
[33:32] massively reducing we usually see
[33:34] bitcoin price action massively
[33:36] increasing because this is when new
[33:37] money is flowing into the space new
[33:39] buyers are coming in and these long-term
[33:41] holders are selling their BTC to
[33:43] shortterm Holders what we could see is
[33:46] earlier in 2024 when we saw this begin
[33:49] decreasing quite noticeably it was as
[33:51] bitcoin's ETF pretty much got launched
[33:53] and Bitcoin right up to a new all-time
[33:54] high and then following that long-term
[33:56] holders again realize that this probably
[33:59] isn't the time to be selling BTC we have
[34:01] this ETF that's just open the doors for
[34:03] potentially tens if not hundreds of
[34:05] billions of dollars to begin pouring in
[34:07] so we saw the long-term holder Supply R
[34:08] pretty stagnant before this started
[34:10] massively increasing one from
[34:12] potentially long-term holders
[34:13] accumulating more as Bitcoin consolidate
[34:16] around this area but again short-term
[34:19] holders who had entered the market who
[34:20] are saw this as an opportunity to buy
[34:23] betc to hold for the long term so then
[34:25] we saw this rapidly increase and again
[34:27] that pretty much marked the bottom
[34:28] before Bitcoin ran up to above $100,000
[34:31] and as this has begun decreasing it's
[34:33] really fueled this move we've seen but
[34:35] over the past few weeks really we've
[34:37] seen the rate of decline begin to
[34:38] decrease and now we've actually seen
[34:40] this flat line as Bitcoin has reached
[34:43] the mid to low $90,000 levels again
[34:45] we're not really seeing a huge amount of
[34:47] profit taking taking place and if I just
[34:49] zoom out we can really see the impact of
[34:51] this over bitcoin's entire history
[34:53] clearest indication being in 2016 2017
[34:56] where as the long-term holders Supply
[34:58] absolutely bottomed it almost marked the
[35:00] exact top of the Bitcoin price section
[35:02] at which point all of this began
[35:04] increasing again as new money stopped
[35:06] pouring in bitcoin's price topped out
[35:08] long-term holders had banked all the
[35:10] profit they wanted to and then the cycle
[35:12] begins again so I do think we're in a
[35:14] pretty good place onchain in terms of
[35:16] onchain data as well we are seeing as
[35:18] well as this a few other indications
[35:20] that selling has at least decreased and
[35:23] like we discussed previously with
[35:25] Trump's inauguration just a couple weeks
[35:27] way and all the promising things that
[35:29] could come of that again 2025 looks like
[35:31] it could be incredibly bullish at least
[35:33] the first few months of 2025 until we
[35:36] potentially start getting overheated
[35:37] again everything looks very set up for a
[35:40] great few months for BTC so now
[35:43] accumulate as much Bitcoin as you as you
[35:45] can this is the time to to to to stack
[35:48] SS if I can summarize that like that
[35:51] well so this almost plays into what we
[35:53] said previously with having different
[35:55] allocations of your Capital so
[35:58] dollar cost averaging in I think now is
[36:00] a good area to begin dollar cost
[36:02] averaging in continue to dollar cost
[36:03] average in I don't think it makes the
[36:05] most sense to dollar cost average when
[36:07] we're seeing lots of onchain points you
[36:09] know really signifying that the Market's
[36:11] getting very overheated but yeah I think
[36:14] now if you are dollar cost averaging in
[36:18] continue to do so every indication
[36:20] points to the fact that the top isn't in
[36:23] and even if we are seeing diminishing
[36:24] returns that could still mean a $200,000
[36:27] Bitcoin in you know under a year's time
[36:29] and how many assets can double in just a
[36:32] few months outside of Bitcoin or more
[36:34] speculative stocks and stuff like that
[36:36] do you think diminishing returns uh are
[36:39] are there for for Bitcoin in in the
[36:41] future or could there be like a major
[36:44] adoption wave uh in this S curve
[36:46] adoption happening I still think
[36:49] diminishing returns are going to
[36:50] continue as as bullish as I am there's
[36:52] lots of people more bullish than I am
[36:54] who could see a a million dollar Bitcoin
[36:56] or something this cycle
[36:58] you have to take into account even
[36:59] though I think diminishing returns are
[37:01] going to happen we could see diminishing
[37:03] returns in terms of percentage gains
[37:05] this cycle compared to last cycle and
[37:07] still see a $300,000 Bitcoin that's how
[37:10] much room we have to go to the upside
[37:12] last cycle we went from 3 and a half
[37:14] th000 to 69,000 if this cycle would go
[37:17] from 15,000 to 300,000 that still fits
[37:19] into diminishing returns but provides
[37:22] $200,000 returns potentially per BTC so
[37:25] I do think diminishing returns are going
[37:27] to happen purely because as the market
[37:29] cap of an asset grows from a few billion
[37:31] dollars to a few trillion dollars the
[37:33] inflows required increase exponentially
[37:36] and I know we do have institutions
[37:37] coming in now potentially corporations
[37:40] potentially a strategic Reserve but that
[37:42] is still an incredible amount of BTC
[37:44] that needs to be purchased for the
[37:46] diminishing returns Theory to break and
[37:48] us to go to four
[37:50] $500,000 Plus in the next 12 to 18
[37:53] months did I ask you how does the power
[37:55] law relate to on data so me and Giovani
[37:59] have had some discussions I'm pretty
[38:01] vocal in my dislike for the power law I
[38:04] know that's going toset a few
[38:06] people I've honestly I can show you
[38:09] afterwards I've I've had hours and hours
[38:11] of conversations with Giovani and as
[38:13] much as I think the power law does work
[38:16] in certain aspects everyone will point
[38:18] to the evidence of it works in this
[38:20] Nature Point of data and it works in
[38:22] this it works in that if we're mopping
[38:24] out bitcoin's adoption I can see power
[38:27] law being a somewhat useful model to do
[38:29] so mapping out bitcoin's price I don't
[38:33] think works too well power Law changes
[38:36] every single day practically because it
[38:38] is best fitting for the data there so
[38:40] why we see oh yeah we've only had a 5%
[38:42] deviation throughout 95% of bitcoin's
[38:45] History if you draw the power law from
[38:47] four years ago it looks entirely
[38:49] different to what it does today so of
[38:51] course at some point we might get closer
[38:52] and closer to that mean as we get more
[38:53] and more data but overall I'm not the
[38:56] biggest fan of the power law and I know
[38:59] that will upset people but I have to be
[39:00] completely
[39:01] honest same kind of thing with stock to
[39:04] flow stock to flow was only a cycle or
[39:08] two ago everyone's favorite thing of oh
[39:10] look at Bitcoin it's destined to go to
[39:12] hundreds of thousands of dollars based
[39:14] on its you know relation in terms of its
[39:16] inflationary rate and circulating Supply
[39:18] when compared to assets like silver and
[39:20] gold But ultimately stock to flow would
[39:22] inevitably fail because it would require
[39:24] Bitcoin to go to hundreds of trillions
[39:26] of dollars in just an couple decades as
[39:29] much as that is a useful model to map in
[39:30] out and as much as power lot might be
[39:32] useful for certain things I wouldn't be
[39:35] the first to suggest using it for your
[39:37] own investing and Analysis of course if
[39:39] it works for you go for it I'm not going
[39:41] to judge anyone if you use the moon
[39:42] cycles or if you use magic tarot cards
[39:45] or whatever go for it if it works for
[39:47] you that's fine but a data point that
[39:50] can change on a daily basis isn't to me
[39:53] something that should be relied upon too
[39:56] extensively uh
[39:57] it has more descriptive power and lesser
[40:01] predictive power I feel like um but yeah
[40:04] I might have a power law discussion
[40:07] coming up very soon because I had jaavan
[40:09] on I had like Fred Kruger already on I
[40:12] had Steven uh paranoid already on and
[40:16] Steph was actually the second most
[40:18] popular episode I had ever on it was
[40:20] like 40K fuse or something like that it
[40:21] was uh going crazy um uh only sailor
[40:26] beat uh be team um but yeah I had some
[40:30] some uh opposing views also on that
[40:32] where we focus on that and there might
[40:35] be a debate coming up let's see if I can
[40:38] set it up I think it would be fun uh to
[40:40] talk to uh to do that um really cool
[40:44] when when we come back to to the
[40:46] institutional side uh it's really
[40:49] interesting as you said we had 2017 and
[40:52] before I think you said 2017 was the
[40:55] example where you said it was retail
[40:56] that
[40:57] and now it seems to be more more
[40:59] institutional let the the the global
[41:02] price uh the Bitcoin price movement uh
[41:06] maybe even like country Le let's see if
[41:08] if if something like that happens how
[41:10] does this change uh the reality of of of
[41:14] Bitcoin or or maybe what impact does it
[41:16] has on on onchain data if the uh
[41:19] psychology behind the institution might
[41:22] be different than OB pychology behind
[41:24] retail people of course that's a that's
[41:27] a very very valid point and definitely
[41:29] something that is being discussed a lot
[41:31] within onchain data communities over the
[41:35] past few months is if we're seeing a
[41:37] million BTC accumulated by these ETFs
[41:40] potentially not to be seen again on the
[41:42] open market potentially that's just
[41:44] going to be held forever even if they
[41:46] are sold they might be sold into dark
[41:48] pools and still stay on coinbase
[41:49] custodian or something like that
[41:51] ultimately while that may impact the
[41:54] numbers in terms of the amount of BTC
[41:56] being moved it's not going to change
[41:58] human psychology you have to take into
[42:00] account that if we look at Bitcoin in
[42:03] 2016 2017 it's not like every BTC was
[42:06] traded from person to person a vast
[42:08] majority of trading was going on
[42:10] exchanges like binance we would see
[42:12] Bitcoin being transferred to exchanges
[42:15] traded there which we can't really see
[42:17] that data before it would be removed
[42:19] however what we can see is there still
[42:21] gives a good reflection of when people
[42:23] are bullish or bearish because they are
[42:24] still sending their BTC to exchanges are
[42:27] off from exchanges so even if the ETFs
[42:29] are accumulating hundreds of thousands
[42:31] of Bitcoin it's a spot ETF they're going
[42:34] to have to buy that Bitcoin and once we
[42:36] see that dry up that's obviously going
[42:37] to give us some insights but as much as
[42:39] I am a proprietor of onchain data it is
[42:42] only one element of what your analysis
[42:45] should be like we looked at Global M2 as
[42:47] a macroeconomic point of view I do think
[42:49] onchain data is something that should be
[42:51] considered but now maybe we do have to
[42:53] consider institutional corporate and
[42:55] potentially sovereign state flows as as
[42:57] well if we're seeing countries secretly
[42:59] accumulating BTC at some point that's
[43:01] going to come to light and we're going
[43:02] to know wow this is now an international
[43:05] settlement currency and countries are
[43:07] now storing it and holding it and buying
[43:09] it accumulating it like they did gold a
[43:11] few decades ago so it's something that
[43:13] we need to look for Confluence if we're
[43:15] seeing like we said ETFs flows drying up
[43:17] or potentially out flows alongside that
[43:19] the just human psychology of people who
[43:21] have been in BTC for a long period of
[43:23] Time begin selling that gives us even
[43:26] more confidence that potentially a
[43:28] market cycle top is in and another thing
[43:30] to consider is even though Bitcoin has
[43:32] been accumulated in the hundreds of
[43:34] thousands by companies like micro
[43:36] strategy with over 400,000 BTC if you
[43:39] aggregate all of the BTC held by the
[43:41] ETFs and corporations like micro
[43:43] strategy it comes out at about 1.5
[43:46] million Bitcoin which is only about 7
[43:48] and a half% of circulating Supply so I
[43:51] know of course lots of Bitcoin has been
[43:52] lost and satoshi's coins Etc which may
[43:54] never move again either way there's
[43:56] still 92 plus per of BTC held by retail
[44:01] Traders people who' have been in Bitcoin
[44:02] for a long period of time people like me
[44:03] and you who aren't institutions who
[44:06] still have an overwhelming majority of
[44:08] the impact on the Bitcoin price action
[44:11] interesting um that that that's an
[44:13] interesting Insight because a lot of
[44:15] people always bring up that argument of
[44:17] oh now the market is controlled by
[44:19] Michael sailor and Larry
[44:21] think that's that that's what I
[44:23] sometimes also get as a as as as
[44:25] comments which then you can point to the
[44:28] data and say like oh like no 92% of the
[44:31] uh whole thing is is not those two and
[44:34] then in those two it's like a lot more
[44:36] people involved it's not like sa and
[44:39] thinker doing it themselves and like
[44:42] let's buy let sell let's try to
[44:43] manipulate the price how hard it is how
[44:46] hard is it actually now to uh move the
[44:49] price I remember when IL musk came in
[44:52] the scene and he announced oh buying and
[44:56] you can buy Tesla for Bitcoin and stuff
[44:58] like that and the the market just went
[45:00] up like crazy but then like a few weeks
[45:03] later he said like oh I have some
[45:04] concerns about the environment and then
[45:06] it went down again I think to a very
[45:09] similar price point before it went up uh
[45:11] I remember that being the case how how
[45:14] hard is this how hard is it now for for
[45:18] an institution a company huge
[45:20] corporation to move the price like that
[45:25] I think it's getting harder and harder
[45:27] however in saying that markets in
[45:29] general this isn't just specific to
[45:31] Bitcoin markets in general are
[45:33] incredibly irrational they always will
[45:35] be because they are driven by human
[45:36] immersion and this isn't just specific
[45:39] to investing markets the entire global
[45:41] economy goes in booms and Buzz Cycles
[45:43] where everyone's incredibly bullish
[45:45] before everyone becomes incredibly
[45:46] bearish I think it's just a force of
[45:48] nature to have these cyclical movements
[45:50] not just in price but in human immersion
[45:53] and just general sentiment in all
[45:55] markets I do think now it's getting
[45:57] harder and harder to manipulate
[45:58] especially Bitcoin has now been
[46:00] solidified as this genuine asset you
[46:03] know previously it was this speculative
[46:05] thing that was used for thieves online
[46:07] and dodgy people to do you know criminal
[46:10] activities Etc The Narrative has
[46:12] completely changed now we're looking at
[46:14] Pension funds allocating multiple
[46:16] percentage to BTC to keep their clients
[46:19] happy that's a massive narrative shift
[46:21] in just a few years and the fact that
[46:23] now Bitcoin is so regulated and it is so
[46:27] in terms of its size it's much much
[46:29] harder to manipulate but still if we are
[46:32] seeing like you said Elon Musk or
[46:35] whoever else coming out and giving these
[46:37] storylines that isn't necessarily
[46:39] manipulation as much as it's a rational
[46:41] human reaction if we see food coming out
[46:44] like we always do at the tail end of
[46:46] bare markets people read that people
[46:47] react to it if we're seeing on Twitter
[46:50] people buying new lambers and going
[46:52] crazy buying new watches Etc it's hard
[46:54] not to get carried away with that and
[46:55] think it's going to continue going up
[46:57] but again this has always happened this
[47:00] is always going to happen it's an
[47:02] inevitability but I do think as Bitcoin
[47:04] becomes a larger and ler asset its
[47:05] volatility decreases and it stabilizes
[47:08] somewhat it's going to be harder for
[47:09] individuals to have as big an influence
[47:11] as they have done
[47:12] historically yeah it's interesting I I
[47:16] remember when I was a huge sailor Fanboy
[47:20] my first year of Orange Building uh uh
[47:23] of getting orange building this was
[47:24] around 2020 when he also came and he was
[47:27] a lot asked of like oh what do you think
[47:29] of the stock flow model of other price
[47:31] models and and all all the data there
[47:34] and I remember him saying some of like
[47:37] okay what what do you do in in a in in a
[47:39] game where a huge new player comes in
[47:43] but I feel like we're already there like
[47:45] the hugest player on earth already are
[47:48] in the game somehow blackr is in here uh
[47:52] we we we have uh potentially America
[47:55] coming in of course uh what happens if
[47:58] Apple tomorrow decides to convert 20% of
[48:02] the balance sheet to bitcoin and
[48:03] announces that publicly that would
[48:05] probably send some Shock waves across
[48:07] the market uh but there not that many
[48:11] big players left of course the big
[48:13] corporations there are a lot of wealth
[48:16] individuals uh but is that even uh is
[48:19] that argument of like huge players
[48:22] coming in the market and disrupting all
[48:24] those uh uh onent data points all the
[48:28] all the models that are around that is
[48:31] that even possible and or are we slowly
[48:35] slowly above that point yeah so at some
[48:38] point onchain data is going to evolve
[48:41] but it has always evolved some at some
[48:43] point we may need to account for the
[48:44] fact that majority of Bitcoin is liquid
[48:46] and held as treasury assets by big
[48:49] corporations I do think what we can see
[48:52] already with this institutional
[48:54] influence and like you said there's not
[48:55] too many big players coming in I think a
[48:57] lot of the big players coming in like
[48:58] micro strategy are never going to sell
[49:00] he can't sell sailor can't sell because
[49:02] he would crash the share price because
[49:04] he's always had this Narrative of never
[49:06] being able to sell but a lot of
[49:08] Corporations even if it is only a few
[49:09] percent will probably add Bitcoin to
[49:11] their balance sheets and that's going to
[49:13] reduce the liquid supply of BTC there's
[49:16] already is a 94% of BTC that will ever
[49:19] exist are already in existence so at
[49:21] some point we are going to get to a
[49:22] point where there's just not that much
[49:24] BTC left for corporations to accumulate
[49:27] and this plays into something called the
[49:28] money multiplier effect I'm not sure if
[49:30] you're aware of that but essentially $1
[49:33] flow into the market doesn't increase
[49:34] the market cap by $1 it increases that
[49:37] by a multiple of that so it's hard to
[49:39] gauge exactly what that is I would say
[49:41] it's somewhere between four and 7x
[49:44] you've heard people say it's as high as
[49:46] 20 50 100 times that I don't think
[49:48] that's the case but if Bitcoin continues
[49:50] to get less and less liquid then that
[49:52] money multiplier is going to increase
[49:54] therefore it doesn't necessarily require
[49:56] every corporation to jump in with 100%
[49:57] of their balance sheet because the
[49:59] amount of available BTC is just
[50:01] continuing to decrease I'm sure we've
[50:03] all seen the stats and tweets of there's
[50:04] not enough Bitcoin for every Millionaire
[50:06] on Earth to buy one at some point the
[50:08] supply and supply and demand economics
[50:11] sorry are going to work in our favor I
[50:13] mean they already are working in our
[50:14] favor with Bitcoin around $100,000 but
[50:17] at some point when 10% of BTC that's
[50:20] available is only liquid for trading
[50:22] every purchase is going to massively
[50:23] increase the market cap but this is
[50:25] where there's also the narrative shift
[50:27] where these big institutions and
[50:29] corporations are they really looking at
[50:32] the day-to-day price of BTC are they
[50:34] really thinking I need to add at least
[50:36] 100 BTC to my wallet probably not the
[50:39] narrative has probably shifted to say I
[50:41] need to hold X percentage of my
[50:43] portfolio in traditional investing you
[50:45] never hear funds say we want to earn x
[50:47] amount of shares of this company or we
[50:49] need to earn this amount of the S&P 500
[50:52] for example they'll allocate 40% of
[50:55] their capital or 5% of their capital
[50:56] Capital so even if it's not x amount of
[50:58] BTC being purchased if we see these
[51:01] corporations adopting that type of
[51:02] mindset to say we need to have at least
[51:04] 5% of our balance sheet held in BTC then
[51:08] the price is really irrelevant to them
[51:10] but the price action that we'll see will
[51:11] be incredibly positive because of that
[51:13] supply and demand economics and the
[51:14] money multiplier effect we'll see from
[51:16] that that's a super interesting Insight
[51:19] basically you you dve to the price more
[51:21] up with with your $1 than than just that
[51:25] $1 because uh of of the of the supply
[51:28] dyamics really cool um for people that
[51:31] now are curious okay where can I start
[51:35] what should I watch if if I want to get
[51:37] more Bitcoin and if I want to see more
[51:41] of the analytics um uh where can this
[51:43] start and especially what metrics are
[51:46] the I don't know past three four metrics
[51:49] to to to look out for well so I might be
[51:52] a little bit biased but I think the best
[51:54] place to start is Bitcoin magazine
[51:56] product
[51:57] and the second best YouTube channel
[51:58] after yours would of course be Bitcoin
[52:00] magazine Pro run by myself where we try
[52:02] and educate people but really it doesn't
[52:05] have to be complicated like I said I
[52:06] think the obviously number one thing
[52:08] would be helping you accumulate more BTC
[52:10] but of course second is helping you save
[52:12] some time the number one thing like I
[52:14] said earlier when I first got into the
[52:16] space I was consuming hundreds if not
[52:18] thousands of hours of BTC content
[52:21] learning how to trade and invest and do
[52:22] all of these wacky things and it all
[52:24] turned out to not even be that impactful
[52:27] these onchain data points by focusing on
[52:29] three or four of them can really
[52:31] massively increase your profitability in
[52:33] a fraction of the time so if it came
[52:35] down to like a top three Allstar list
[52:38] we'll say the mvrv Z score I absolutely
[52:41] love like we discussed earlier which is
[52:42] looking at the relationship between the
[52:45] average accumulation price of all BTC
[52:47] holders and the current market cap it's
[52:50] just really nice way to see the mass
[52:52] psychology of wow we're at a 5x on our
[52:54] position historically that is a pretty
[52:56] good indication that the Market's
[52:57] getting a little overheated or majority
[52:59] are at a loss in their position again
[53:01] pretty good indication that the market
[53:03] is potentially a little bit undervalued
[53:04] and you can get in at maybe a bit of a
[53:06] discount second one I really like the
[53:08] spent output profit ratio again these
[53:10] are all just looking at the supply and
[53:12] demand and profit taking of BTC so I can
[53:14] just share this really
[53:16] quickly two secs here we go so the spent
[53:19] output profit ratio what we can see is
[53:22] every single Bitcoin transaction we can
[53:24] actually see how much US dollar profit
[53:26] they made on that position or how much
[53:28] US dollar loss they made on that
[53:29] position so what we can see is periods
[53:32] where people are selling at an extreme
[53:34] loss like at the tail end of bare
[53:35] markets like in the covid 2020 dip like
[53:38] in the tail end of the 2018 bare Market
[53:40] when people are selling at a loss this
[53:42] is when you need to buy when there's
[53:43] blood in the streets like I said almost
[53:45] all of these prove that counter trading
[53:48] and moving in an opposing nature to the
[53:50] general consensus has almost always out
[53:52] formed a vast majority of people it is
[53:55] really reiterated in on chain data like
[53:57] this and same is true for the upside
[53:58] once everyone's euphoric taking profit
[54:01] seeing transfers to exchanges usually a
[54:04] good indication that the Market's
[54:05] getting a little H heated and like I
[54:07] said this has actually started declining
[54:08] slightly after we surpassed $100,000 and
[54:11] had a little bit of retracement so that'
[54:13] be my second one and then the third one
[54:15] would be something like this which is
[54:18] the realized cap hot waves so this is a
[54:20] really interesting one so the mvrv Z
[54:22] score we mentioned previously is looking
[54:24] at the average accumulation price of all
[54:26] BTC on the network what we can actually
[54:28] do is see the influence of that realized
[54:31] price by different age bands so just
[54:34] really quickly what I can do is remove
[54:36] all of these age bands apart from say
[54:40] the 24hour ones and you're just going to
[54:43] see a little line on the chart so what
[54:45] this is showing is say on December the
[54:47] 8th 2017 over 133% nearly 133% of the
[54:53] influence on the realized price or the
[54:54] price paid for BTC was made for people
[54:57] who entered the market that day which is
[54:59] a huge amount considering Bitcoin at
[55:01] this point in time had been around for
[55:02] over 10 years well nearly 10 years sorry
[55:05] 133% of the influence on the average
[55:07] accumulation price of all BTC was made
[55:09] by people made in the last day is crazy
[55:12] and if we just add on up to say six
[55:14] months and then add the Bitcoin price
[55:16] action back what we can see is when new
[55:18] capital is flowing into the market and
[55:20] paying excessively higher prices than
[55:22] experienced traders that usually really
[55:24] indicates that the market is becoming
[55:25] incredible overheated so again what we
[55:28] can see in pretty much every single
[55:29] Market Peak is people come in and pay 60
[55:32] 70 80% of the average accumulation price
[55:35] just within the past few weeks and
[55:37] months to accumulate BTC this is formo
[55:40] happening in real time that we can
[55:41] monitor and just as something to note
[55:44] currently we're at a pretty healthy
[55:45] level we're seeing Capital coming in
[55:47] obviously driving prices higher a lot of
[55:49] institutional inflows but still at
[55:51] pretty tame levels pretty comparable to
[55:54] what we saw in 2024 as we reach that
[55:56] first alltime high around 73 $74,000 so
[55:59] there is still significant room to go to
[56:01] the upside but again once we start
[56:03] seeing the warning signals flash even if
[56:05] everything's looking positive we're
[56:06] seeing great news events everything
[56:08] looks in our favor there's a strategic
[56:10] reserve examp for example when we see a
[56:13] huge amount of btc's average cost basis
[56:17] being made by New Market participants
[56:19] that has always indicated that the
[56:20] market is overheated and it likely
[56:22] always will so this will probably be my
[56:24] third choice for a top three of on chain
[56:26] metrics just to get started all of these
[56:28] are free on the site you can use them if
[56:30] you get a site subscription you can get
[56:31] alerts and access to other data but it's
[56:33] just a way to dip your toes into this
[56:35] data to see if it works for you in your
[56:37] strategy those would be three good
[56:39] examples for you really cool can you
[56:41] then also um if you see all the data of
[56:45] of selling and buying can you kind of
[56:47] label the smart money and the dumb money
[56:50] on on on chain and and and try to follow
[56:52] the smart money yeah exactly so just as
[56:55] a another quick one I had loaded up here
[56:58] which is the one-year huddle wave which
[56:59] is the amount of BTC that had been held
[57:01] for at least one year and typically what
[57:03] we see is the Smart money which are
[57:05] swing traders who hold Bitcoin for about
[57:08] 2-year time frame based on the
[57:10] traditional four-year cycle what we can
[57:12] see is they begin massively offloading
[57:14] BTC as we get to these cycle Peaks and
[57:16] begin accumulating BTC as we get into
[57:19] these cycle lows and this is just a
[57:21] really simple way to just see the
[57:23] cyclical nature of smart money
[57:25] accumulating and Distributing BTC and
[57:28] that's just one example but we have lots
[57:29] of different ways you can track this
[57:30] smart money we can isolate the realized
[57:33] price by just shortterm holders or
[57:34] long-term holders by just balances
[57:37] holding x amount of BTC with certain
[57:40] charts but just as a really simple way
[57:41] to visualize this and how long-term
[57:45] investors actually act in extreme market
[57:47] conditions we see them massively
[57:49] offloading BTC as the market gets
[57:51] overheated and now again we're seeing
[57:54] some profit taking like we have done at
[57:57] this stage in all previous Cycles but
[57:59] this isn't anything to worry about this
[58:00] is completely healthy this is what is
[58:01] driving price higher this new capital
[58:03] coming into the markets but at some
[58:05] point we are going to see this bottom
[58:07] out and we are going to see the market
[58:08] Peak and hopefully you've scaled out
[58:10] enough to sufficiently buy incredibly
[58:12] more BTC when we get to the tail end of
[58:15] the next be cycle absolutely really
[58:17] interesting stuff I I was always
[58:19] fascinating for me that you can see so
[58:22] much from the on onchain bitcoin data
[58:24] and you can actually kind of kind of see
[58:27] where Bitcoin is at and and even drive
[58:29] decision from that data driven decisions
[58:32] is is is always in my eyes at least a
[58:36] great idea a good good thing to do
[58:39] um what what uh one thing that because
[58:42] we already at like one hour and there's
[58:44] so many question in my head but maybe we
[58:46] can do a part two one thing I'm curious
[58:48] about you also how has since you got
[58:51] into Bitcoin and I think you said 2017
[58:54] how has Bitcoin shaped your standing of
[58:57] money and investing and maybe also then
[59:00] the the onchain data analyst so when I
[59:03] first got into Bitcoin I'll be
[59:04] completely honest it was to try and make
[59:06] just more money I was working in a a
[59:08] pretty boring corporate job and I'd
[59:10] heard of Bitcoin years ago I have a
[59:11] background in it networking and security
[59:14] so I'd heard of Bitcoin but I always
[59:16] thought it was just this fad thing and
[59:18] here in the UK investing isn't really
[59:21] that common or popular or or talked
[59:23] about it's not something that's really
[59:24] taught in schools in America it seems to
[59:27] be much more prevalent you know the idea
[59:29] of investing and opening you know 401ks
[59:32] Etc in the UK you have a pension which
[59:35] is managed by your employer and that's
[59:36] really it it's not very popular thing so
[59:38] when I first heard about it and heard I
[59:40] could make some money there was a a
[59:41] little Gambler inside of me that wanted
[59:43] to you know just try and make a quick
[59:44] book and it was only afterwards that I
[59:46] researched BTC realized what was
[59:48] actually happening happening in the
[59:51] fiscal systems you know the impact of
[59:54] inflation and how we're basically slaves
[59:56] to continuously produce and continuously
[59:58] spend just to stimulate the economy and
[60:01] it's only after you kind of delve into
[60:02] that hole I'm sure everyone watching
[60:04] this has been orange pill to some extent
[60:06] where you really realize wow what
[60:08] happened why why did we go off the gold
[60:10] standard in the US why is the current
[60:12] world economic system built on this just
[60:15] constantly churning money printing it
[60:17] doesn't really make any sense so after
[60:21] making a little bit of money and then
[60:22] losing all of my money and then trying
[60:23] to lend as much as I could about Bitcoin
[60:25] I really Iz that this is something I
[60:26] wanted to be involved in full-time so
[60:28] after that I learned everything I could
[60:30] I read every single book on the topic I
[60:32] did every single online course on the
[60:34] topic and then after that I was
[60:36] convinced that I was going to rectify
[60:38] the my Stakes some previously and it was
[60:40] as I learned about Bitcoin as a
[60:41] technology that I really understood wow
[60:44] we can see the supply and demand
[60:45] economics we can see all of this
[60:47] activity in real time like nothing else
[60:49] it kind of nullified a lot of the
[60:52] information I'd learned previously a lot
[60:54] of the trading strategies and stuff
[60:56] because it's not like traditional assets
[60:57] people who would maybe be selling
[60:59] courses on how to trade gold and other
[61:01] Commodities don't have access to even a
[61:03] fraction of the data that every single
[61:05] one of us has access to when it comes to
[61:07] bitcoin and it's very unique in that
[61:09] aspect that we can see all of these
[61:10] transactions and we can see the monetary
[61:13] elements of BTC in an open source nature
[61:16] which is absolutely amazing and it's
[61:17] something that again I hope I can be
[61:20] involved in for as long as possible and
[61:21] hopefully continue to educate and help
[61:23] people to understand the current finan
[61:25] iial systems that many are being you
[61:27] know exposed to in the traditional world
[61:29] of Finance hopefully help them to
[61:32] understand BTC and its scar limited
[61:33] properties and hopefully as well as that
[61:36] understand the data so they can
[61:37] hopefully even if it's just accumulating
[61:39] at the most opportune moments I know
[61:40] most people don't even want to buy and
[61:42] sell too frequently but if we can
[61:44] outline periods where we say right here
[61:46] it makes more sense to aggressively
[61:48] rotate into BTC here maybe it makes
[61:51] sense to spend some of that BTC put a
[61:54] deposit down on your house whatever you
[61:55] want to do then that's great that's
[61:57] that's my ultimate goal to just try and
[61:58] help educate people on BTC its
[62:01] properties and the data we can use to
[62:04] best perform when it comes to our
[62:05] investments really cool uh how do you
[62:08] think long-term Bitcoin will be as an
[62:12] indicator for markets I think if if
[62:14] Bitcoin becomes a huge thing in our
[62:17] overall Financial um system I guess
[62:21] Bitcoin itself the Bitcoin price the
[62:24] Bitcoin onchange data and stuff like
[62:26] that could be not only important for
[62:30] getting more Bitcoin but also being
[62:32] maybe important Market insights in the
[62:35] overall psychology of the of the people
[62:38] if they more saving if they more
[62:39] investing if they more whatever do do
[62:41] you think that Bitcoin can involve in
[62:43] that um kind of insight in the overall
[62:46] psychology of of the world's Finance
[62:49] yeah 100% And I mean at the minute we
[62:51] see Bitcoin being incredibly correlated
[62:53] to assets like the S&P 500 the NASDAQ
[62:56] and traditional us equities just purely
[62:59] because of its more speculative nature I
[63:02] guess but because Bitcoin is a 247 asset
[63:05] it gives us this unique insight into
[63:07] seeing human psychology at all hours of
[63:09] the day whereas the S&P 500 for example
[63:13] I think today is a trading holiday we
[63:15] have no idea what investor thoughts are
[63:17] but we can see from the Bitcoin Market
[63:18] where we're down a few per a day maybe
[63:20] people are a little bit bearish and it
[63:21] gives us that kind of pre-market open
[63:24] insight into human psychology and unless
[63:27] we see a BTC decoupling which I could
[63:29] talk about for another hour or so well
[63:32] unless we see Bitcoin have this extended
[63:34] period of time where it has a at least
[63:36] reduced correlation to us equities And
[63:38] Trades as its own asset for the time
[63:41] being we don't have that we we are still
[63:43] incredibly correlated to the S&P 500 if
[63:45] we do see a huge recession I think
[63:47] Bitcoin is going to struggle if we see a
[63:48] huge exponential bull rally continuing
[63:51] in equities then again I can see Bitcoin
[63:53] continuing do incredibly well but is
[63:55] unique to see that human psychology
[63:57] onchain because of course if bitcoin's
[63:59] doing well and equities are doing well
[64:01] and we start seeing onchain data within
[64:04] the Bitcoin Network to say people are
[64:05] beginning to sell that could be this
[64:07] early indication for not just Bitcoin
[64:10] but for all equities for all Investments
[64:12] that maybe we are a little overextended
[64:14] over joyous to the upside so it's very
[64:16] unique in that element interesting what
[64:19] needs to happen uh that we decouple from
[64:23] that I think since I'm in Bitcoin
[64:25] everyone is talking about that that it
[64:27] we will probably soon be decoupled from
[64:30] that uh but I think it takes a little
[64:32] bit longer time what needs to happen
[64:34] that Bitcoin is decoupling from risk
[64:36] risk assets uh which just I feel like it
[64:39] just means
[64:41] volatility I think we have now seen the
[64:45] Catalyst for that to become a thing the
[64:48] ETFs the institutional offerings I think
[64:51] was step one in this BTC decoupling
[64:54] previously when it was ril driven or
[64:56] even in the previous cycle when it was
[64:58] leverage driven by these companies like
[65:00] FDX Etc like we discussed that's still a
[65:03] very speculative asset where people were
[65:05] mainly using it as a means to make more
[65:08] money let's be honest whereas now like
[65:10] we said previously where if the
[65:12] narrative has shifted as something where
[65:14] it needs to be added to everyone's
[65:15] balance sheet or portfolios previously
[65:18] it was a 60% equities 40% bonds or
[65:21] something maybe now we've changed to add
[65:23] 5% of Bitcoin to that and I think that
[65:26] narrative shift is going to be one of
[65:28] the things that could lead to this
[65:29] decoupling where we finally fulfill The
[65:31] Narrative of a digital gold if you like
[65:34] where people don't necessarily tie
[65:36] Bitcoin to speculative assets or
[65:38] equities like the S&P 500 and it has it
[65:40] is seen as a hedge against inflation and
[65:44] traditional monetary policies with its
[65:46] unique monetary properties and its
[65:49] having event and and all of this stuff I
[65:52] think the the flu Gates have opened but
[65:54] I still think we might be a couple
[65:55] Cycles away like I said the ETFs and
[65:58] corporations currently having about 7
[66:00] and a half% of the circulating Supply
[66:02] once that gets to 20 30% which it will
[66:05] in not that long considering we've got
[66:07] to seven and a half percent in you know
[66:09] not very long at all at that point maybe
[66:11] we start having a conversation of is
[66:14] btcc sorry still correlated incredibly
[66:17] strongly with these things or is it it's
[66:19] un unique asset and I think the big test
[66:21] of that is when we have the next big
[66:23] Global recession which has been just
[66:25] around the corner for years now but at
[66:26] some point we will get one at that point
[66:29] if we see Bitcoin begin to start
[66:31] outperforming massively a lot of things
[66:33] even during Market wide downtrend then
[66:36] that'll potentially even catapult and
[66:38] snowball even more as more people say
[66:40] wow this is the asset that it promised
[66:42] to be that it set out to be this hedge
[66:43] against Bad monetary policies and
[66:45] Central Bank printing that even more
[66:47] Capital flows into this unique asset
[66:49] this unique scarce asset like Bitcoin
[66:51] like gold but you know Bitcoin being the
[66:53] digital girl that actually has some util
[66:55] in terms of international settlement if
[66:57] you try and send $100 million a gold
[66:59] good luck with that then maybe that can
[67:01] be the real starting point of a a true
[67:04] decoupling Ah that's that's amazing I I
[67:07] think uh it would definitely help as you
[67:10] said really cool um we have one question
[67:13] that I asked each and every one of uh my
[67:15] guests and the question is what can we
[67:17] learn from you besides
[67:19] Bitcoin wow great question I was expect
[67:22] I was when you said one question I was
[67:24] almost certain you gonna say what's the
[67:26] price going to be at the Bitcoin cycle
[67:29] Peak I I usually try to avoid asking
[67:32] that uh but you can answer that also I I
[67:36] prefer to not answer that hopefully if
[67:38] you've learned one thing it's to try and
[67:40] be a little bit more reactive with your
[67:42] investing in analysis then predictive so
[67:44] I'm going to actually not answer that
[67:45] one but what I I'm hoping I can
[67:48] hopefully in part is a little bit of
[67:50] wisdom outside of just onchain data and
[67:52] analytics is to not spend too much time
[67:56] when it comes to finance and investing
[67:59] and looking through all this data the
[68:01] reason I got into this unchain stuff is
[68:03] because I didn't like spending all of my
[68:05] time in front of charts there's no point
[68:08] in accumulating more wealth by just
[68:10] spending 20 hours a day locked up in a
[68:12] room looking at Price action if you can
[68:15] spend a few hours a month to have the
[68:18] same returns and spend the rest of your
[68:19] time doing things that are beneficial to
[68:21] you your friends and family physically
[68:24] mentally spirit whatever you want to do
[68:27] then that is a two two times win like I
[68:29] said our biggest out performance isn't
[68:31] just monitoring gains in terms of
[68:34] percentages but in terms of the amount
[68:36] of hours that you need to do this
[68:37] analysis massively being reduced allows
[68:39] you to spend time doing things that you
[68:41] actually want to do and allow you to
[68:44] hopefully spend this wealth that you've
[68:45] accumulated through this
[68:48] outperformance yeah very true really
[68:50] cool um we have also another end routine
[68:53] also not about the price okay okay uh
[68:56] where the previous guest is asking a
[68:57] question for the next guest without
[68:59] knowing who the next guest actually is
[69:01] and the previous guest asks you the
[69:02] question if you can give up your phone
[69:05] or your computer for a day which one
[69:08] would you give up and why that's a good
[69:10] question I I think I would choose my
[69:13] phone because it would be harder to give
[69:15] up there's quite a few days where I
[69:16] don't go on my computer I try and limit
[69:18] myself to you know have weekends off and
[69:19] stuff where it's really hard to get away
[69:21] from your phone I'll be the first to
[69:22] admit that so if I could force myself to
[69:25] be away from my phone and actually talk
[69:27] to people if that's still a thing and go
[69:29] outside if that's still a thing and
[69:30] enjoy nature then that would be great so
[69:33] I would choose that purely because it
[69:34] would be difficult and it would almost
[69:36] Make Me Maybe appreciate the little
[69:38] things more and maybe appreciate the
[69:40] next time I get my phone back
[69:42] interesting so the computer for you is
[69:44] easier to give up actually yeah I think
[69:46] so I I I can get all my trading viewer
[69:49] alerts and all my Bitcoin magazine Pro
[69:51] alerts on my phone so I don't actually
[69:53] need the computer to begin specul
[69:56] speculating and gambling yeah it's
[69:57] interesting because I could do
[70:00] everything that I do also on my phone
[70:02] but I actually prefer the comp uh
[70:04] computer so I would uh it would be so
[70:06] much easier for me to give up the phone
[70:09] uh because all the addictive stuff is
[70:11] also on my computer like the the Twitter
[70:13] feed is also on my computer uh and uh
[70:18] when I'm at home I usually like I don't
[70:20] even know where my phone currently is
[70:22] probably some somewhere around the house
[70:24] uh and uh
[70:26] I'm I think I'm more addicted to the
[70:28] computer I don't know if that's good
[70:30] probably not probably neither's good
[70:32] let's be honest absolutely you should be
[70:34] addicted to get outside and have have
[70:37] fun with your partner and with friends
[70:40] exactly which I will actually do right
[70:42] now it's uh today is the day I mean not
[70:44] when it this will come out but today is
[70:46] first the 9th of January uh we have um
[70:49] and meet up always in Vienna with the
[70:53] with with yeah bitcoiners in Vienna and
[70:55] this actually starts in like an hour so
[70:58] I will go there today and yeah do
[70:59] exactly what what I'm supposed to do
[71:01] meet out bit Corners in real life nice I
[71:04] have a few uh shandies or non-alcoholic
[71:06] beers I'm sure and a schnitzel or two
[71:09] yes I I'm actually hungry so yeah I will
[71:12] definitely do this thank you so much
