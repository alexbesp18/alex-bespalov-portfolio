[00:00] I believe that El Salvador is the
[00:03] epicenter of the new financial and
[00:06] technological Global Paradigm if there's
[00:09] that single point of failure then we are
[00:11] basically kept hostage we're building it
[00:13] on top of the nosta protocol and the
[00:14] beauty part the Noster protocol is there
[00:16] is no single point of failure we have
[00:18] the ability to take our identity out of
[00:20] an existing system and say I don't want
[00:22] to deal with that anymore they went to
[00:23] the hospital to actually get their MRI
[00:26] information in the hospital oh no you
[00:27] can have it and they are going like how
[00:29] can be that it's it's my body we are the
[00:32] inside of my body and I can't have the
[00:35] information about my body we live in a
[00:37] world where we sincerely don't control
[00:39] our health data and it's because we
[00:41] don't have our own health identities the
[00:43] doctors and the hospitals and stuff like
[00:45] that they now have to listen to me
[00:47] because otherwise I'm going to go
[00:48] somewhere else that's someone that does
[00:50] respect my control of my own identity
[00:52] and my own health information Etc you
[00:54] have your medical data in El Salvador
[00:56] you fly to a hospital to Austria you
[00:58] give them your access to the data and
[01:00] they already have all the data which was
[01:03] previously just in salor and now as a
[01:05] patience have control over the people
[01:07] that want my information and are
[01:09] interested in my information and I have
[01:12] also so much control that they have to
[01:14] ask me for it is it also them possible
[01:16] to get paid for sharing your medical
[01:19] data directly if we can build the tools
[01:22] that allow us to do the same like in the
[01:24] digital world as we were in the physical
[01:26] world where we control our physical
[01:28] bodies in the physical world and our
[01:30] digital bodies the digital world then
[01:32] all of a sudden things can
[01:34] [Music]
[01:37] change why is
[01:40] centralization uh bad and where is
[01:42] centralization uh bad for society I I
[01:46] don't think I don't think it's
[01:47] necessarily centralization that is bad I
[01:51] think the problem is probably more
[01:54] around single points of failure actually
[01:57] if I think about it um that that's is
[02:00] where it's bad where we do not have a
[02:03] choice anymore because that there's a
[02:06] one single point of be it's the
[02:07] government be it an organization be it a
[02:09] technology be it whatever it is um if
[02:12] there's that single point of failure
[02:14] then we are basically kept hostage
[02:16] hostage you know I mean too big to fail
[02:20] you've heard of that right um I think
[02:23] that in itself actually says absolutely
[02:26] everything that we're talking about here
[02:28] so it's not necessarily Central ization
[02:30] or you know managing something from a
[02:32] central point but if it's too big to
[02:34] fail then that's is the problem so I
[02:39] would say yeah I mean some things would
[02:41] be good if they're run by you know um
[02:44] like a central body of some swords Etc
[02:46] but if it's too big to fail then we have
[02:49] a problem so interesting that would be
[02:51] my my answer yeah um single points of
[02:53] failure they are they are the bigger
[02:57] challenge interesting and that's the
[03:00] thing that you also saw that's wrong
[03:02] with the health care System
[03:05] right well I think I think right now I
[03:08] mean um I always sort of highlight the
[03:11] fact that we had 2008 the global
[03:14] financial crisis and that then spawned
[03:17] the idea of Bitcoin and the world was
[03:21] aware okay something is not good we have
[03:24] a situation where money
[03:27] is centrally controlled um it's again a
[03:30] single point of failure and as a result
[03:33] of that you know things like Bitcoin
[03:35] came along so that obviously was the the
[03:40] world was ready the world was basically
[03:42] you know told okay clearly we need to
[03:44] fix this up and then Bitcoin comes along
[03:46] and it gets traction and adoption and
[03:48] stuff like that I also think that with
[03:52] what we've experienced in the last five
[03:54] years um in relation to health and
[03:58] identities and all kind of stuff um yeah
[04:02] has done the same thing so in other
[04:04] words I mean I've seen what happened in
[04:07] Austria and you know how people were
[04:09] again controlled by these single points
[04:11] of control single points of failure um
[04:15] and that obviously has created I guess
[04:18] enough awareness with people that hey
[04:21] saying yeah I think it is time that we
[04:24] need to do something about this and
[04:28] therefore um you know know things like
[04:31] health and managing my own health
[04:34] identity because we clearly don't
[04:36] anymore right um they they
[04:40] become relevant because people start to
[04:42] think about it people start to say hey
[04:44] okay there's something that needs to be
[04:46] fixed here so just like Bitcoin money
[04:49] now we've got identities and my data and
[04:52] all that kind of stuff same story I
[04:54] think what we're doing right now with
[04:56] the salute protocol that we're
[04:58] developing is
[05:01] would not have worked five years ago
[05:03] before all this stuff happened so I
[05:06] think that answers your question right
[05:08] absolutely and the protocol protocol
[05:11] that you are developing that's based on
[05:13] Nostra As I understood it like is that a
[05:16] Noster protocol based on that yeah so
[05:19] Noster is obviously a uh a protocol that
[05:22] allows that that uses that the public
[05:25] private key uh model like Bitcoin right
[05:29] um and with that public private key
[05:31] scenario I can control my I guess
[05:34] identity but also control what's my
[05:37] identity shares or transmits or whatever
[05:40] it is so in other words the Noster um
[05:43] bit of transmission of of
[05:45] information um is controlled by the guy
[05:47] that actually owns the keys and or the
[05:50] person that owns the keys or the entity
[05:52] that owns the keys so what we're doing
[05:54] is we're building on top of that
[05:56] technology a I guess a framework what
[05:58] we're doing is building a framework that
[06:01] is all about health about controlling
[06:03] your health identity your health
[06:05] information how that is structure that
[06:08] information inside the protocol um and
[06:12] how that is obviously flowing through
[06:15] relays and how data can be accessed by
[06:18] by obviously hospitals and how data can
[06:20] be data can be acessed by by bigger
[06:22] entities Etc so yeah we're building on
[06:25] top of the nosta protocol and the beauty
[06:27] about the nosta protocol is there is no
[06:28] single point failure so yeah so it's uh
[06:31] that's that's I guess the big motivation
[06:33] and it's not on a blockchain it's not to
[06:36] essentially organized by some entity or
[06:39] some blockchain company or something
[06:41] like that it's just out there it is um
[06:44] open source and no one can control that
[06:49] a bit like the whole the whole Bitcoin
[06:50] thing no one can control um the relays
[06:53] out there no one can Central they can
[06:56] centralize the relays but I have the
[06:57] ability to say take my identity away
[07:00] and put it somewhere else so and I think
[07:02] that's the key to this whole thing I
[07:04] think the key to decentralize money or
[07:07] say Bitcoin is the fact that we have the
[07:10] ability to actually take us out of an
[07:12] existing system I think that um what
[07:15] we're doing here is the same thing you
[07:16] know we have the ability to take our
[07:18] identity out of an existing system and
[07:20] say I don't want to deal with that
[07:22] anymore so does that answer your
[07:24] question absolutely absolutely really
[07:26] cool uh and is the and you just launched
[07:29] it as a saw it uh and you try trying
[07:32] that now in Salvador if that works uh
[07:35] because the all all the doctors and
[07:38] stuff like that they have to probably
[07:39] adopt it and put the data it's crazy for
[07:41] me uh when I think about it now um my uh
[07:46] data my medical data the the doctors
[07:49] have like I have no clue how to to
[07:51] access that there's no platform where I
[07:54] can learn let's let's look at my all my
[07:56] history but the doctors have those those
[07:58] datas in Austria at least um like that
[08:01] that would be that's the idea of like
[08:03] switching that that data from the
[08:05] doctors to myself and if the doctors
[08:07] needed I can give them access
[08:09] temporarily to the data that that would
[08:12] be the the uh the perfect goal to like
[08:15] have full access not only with Bitcoin
[08:16] with your money but also about your data
[08:18] and Health Data is probably one of the
[08:22] most um important one probably the most
[08:25] important uh data that you you can have
[08:27] about yourself uh uh because yeah Health
[08:30] goes over everything uh that's that's
[08:33] amazing first of all like what you're
[08:35] doing um but now um how are you doing
[08:39] that in in in El Salvador as a as a
[08:41] testing ground yeah so um yeah I
[08:47] mean I I know stories I mean uh crazy
[08:51] stories I mean I remember talking to
[08:52] someone last week and they told me a
[08:55] story where they had an MRI um done they
[08:59] went to the hospital to actually get
[09:01] their MRI information the hospital or
[09:03] the doctor whoever said is oh no you
[09:05] can't have it and I'm going and they are
[09:07] going like how can that be that it's
[09:10] it's my body you're the inside of my
[09:12] body and I can't have the information
[09:15] about my body and it's a bit strange if
[09:17] you think about it right so um and
[09:20] that's the world that we live in right
[09:22] now I mean it never it didn't used to be
[09:24] like that but it's definitely moved like
[09:26] that in the last probably 20 30 years so
[09:30] um so the idea that you literally have
[09:33] zero control over your own Health Data
[09:36] your own property I guess because that
[09:39] information that comes out of your body
[09:41] is your property isn't it I I would say
[09:43] it would be um is is strange I always
[09:47] sort of take this um this opportunity I
[09:49] guess as a as a let's go do a scenario
[09:52] right so um you're in Austria what is a
[09:56] common first name in Austria
[10:00] uh hair her okay what is a common last
[10:04] name in Austria uh the German one is
[10:06] Miller
[10:07] like common last name let's go with
[10:10] Müller yes let's go with Müller then we
[10:12] also have the CH there let's go with
[10:14] Herbert Miller so think about this
[10:17] Herbert Miller goes into the doctor's
[10:19] office right and says to the doctor hi
[10:22] I'm Herbert Miller uh you know I have
[10:25] situations the doctor actually goes into
[10:27] his computer and goes okay Herbert
[10:29] Miller wres cool all right Herbert I can
[10:32] see this and this about you and um your
[10:34] situation and um look from what I can
[10:37] tell and what you're telling me maybe we
[10:39] should do this drug plan and we should
[10:41] do this test and this and this Okay cool
[10:43] so herit goes away he says thank
[10:44] goodness you know someone's looking
[10:46] after me and two months later come her
[10:50] comes back and he's got more diseases
[10:52] more issues with himself etc etc and it
[10:56] turns out right and this is sort of the
[10:58] anecdote that I try to always explain
[11:00] with people is it was the wrong Herbert
[11:03] Miller because there was 10 in the
[11:04] system and the doctor chose the wrong
[11:06] one right
[11:07] so what does that mean and what does
[11:10] that tell us is that again we don't
[11:13] control our information or information
[11:16] is with someone else probably not even
[11:18] with the doctor it's some centralized
[11:19] entity some computer system whatever it
[11:21] is that owns all that information right
[11:24] but because we don't control it all
[11:27] these things can happen with it
[11:29] um one is things like errors two is is
[11:32] the information verified is it true is
[11:35] it honest is it all that kind of stuff
[11:37] so that's the world that we live in we
[11:38] live in a world where we sincerely don't
[11:41] control our health data and it's because
[11:42] we don't have our own health identities
[11:45] as well and what we're doing is to say
[11:48] okay well instead of Herbert going to
[11:50] the doctor and let letting them look how
[11:52] about Herbert actually says yeah it's me
[11:54] Herbert and the doctor says have you got
[11:56] any information and you can say yes here
[11:58] you go I can release it to you you can
[11:59] see if you can see exactly what the
[12:02] information is Herbert this Herbert
[12:05] truly controls that information and says
[12:08] okay here it is and that information is
[12:11] also not again manipulatable because I
[12:14] control the keys of that information so
[12:16] in other words all of a sudden the
[12:18] health information that is being
[12:19] transmitted and and moved back and forth
[12:23] is verified by the actual owner and the
[12:25] individual so I know that an information
[12:28] is most l i don't believe in 100% but
[12:32] 99.9% accurate no one can play around in
[12:36] the database behind the scenes no one
[12:38] can play around in the technology behind
[12:40] the scenes and change the fields and the
[12:43] information on the fields so all of a
[12:45] sudden I have this ability to control my
[12:48] health information I have the ability to
[12:51] verifiably say okay this is true and as
[12:54] a result um what comes out there is is
[12:58] uh guess more valuable information I
[13:01] have control and all of a sudden the
[13:04] doctors and the hospitals and stuff like
[13:06] that they now have to listen to me
[13:09] because otherwise I'm going to go
[13:10] somewhere else that's someone that does
[13:12] respect my control of my own identity
[13:14] and my own health information Etc so
[13:17] that's the story I guess the first
[13:20] story El Salvador so
[13:24] um we obviously were all there I think
[13:26] was 20 2021 right when the the became
[13:30] reality um i' I've been in the Bitcoin
[13:33] game for quite a long time um and
[13:37] obviously love the idea of self-
[13:40] sovereignty and you know separating
[13:43] money and States all that kind of stuff
[13:46] so when the law became a reality I said
[13:49] to my other half I think we should go
[13:52] there we did our thing we packed our
[13:54] bags we went to El Salvador because what
[13:57] I believe is that if you as a government
[14:00] are truly willing to give away the power
[14:02] of money to you to to the people right
[14:07] that sort of gives you an understanding
[14:09] of the mindset of the country or of that
[14:12] situation over there and that in itself
[14:17] I believe is okay you are literally
[14:20] giving that power away which probably
[14:23] means that you're also open to new ideas
[14:25] and new technologies and stuff like that
[14:28] like the stuff that we talking about
[14:29] here so I actually am in the healthc
[14:33] care space in Australia I have a a
[14:37] software business there um that is in
[14:39] the healthcare and I know what it's like
[14:42] in the traditional centralized software
[14:44] sort of World um so yeah it wasn't
[14:48] really my my thing so when that all
[14:50] happened uh we decided to move over here
[14:54] and said okay let's build something here
[14:57] and that's where that came from so I
[14:59] came to this country country that is
[15:01] open to all this stuff um and then met
[15:04] um people that are Salvador and people
[15:07] that are actually in in this whole you
[15:09] know Noster space and stuff like that
[15:12] and we the ideas that I've been working
[15:15] on um we started to implement and
[15:18] started to build and um all that is
[15:22] wonderful I mean technology is great um
[15:24] it is awesome you build architectures
[15:27] you build you know how technology needs
[15:29] to work all that stuff is is is perfect
[15:32] the only thing is that how does it work
[15:35] in the real world so therefore we said
[15:39] okay the best approach to finalizing and
[15:42] to building this thing properly we need
[15:45] to make sure that whatever we've built
[15:47] whatever we've created that needs to
[15:49] be developed in conjunction with the
[15:53] real world as well so we built it all
[15:55] we've got it all behind behind the
[15:56] scenes now it is for the real world
[15:59] to actually interact with it and then
[16:03] once that's done then we can have say we
[16:04] have a full package we have the full
[16:06] protocol ready and then we can release
[16:08] that to the world so we were fortunate
[16:11] enough to me find a hospital and um um
[16:14] that is innovative enough and crazy
[16:16] enough to actually work with us um and
[16:20] that's what we're doing so we're
[16:21] deploying the the phases of this project
[16:25] um uh with the local Sal with the local
[16:28] Salvador in hospital um and yeah it's
[16:32] it's as I said it's awesome we've just
[16:33] rolled out um phase one it's all working
[16:36] and um we're now onto uh phase two and
[16:40] um yeah it's it's it's it's happening
[16:43] it's working it's it's becoming reality
[16:46] which is quite exciting I mean gives me
[16:47] goosebumps I can tell you really
[16:49] interesting it's also um the the
[16:51] beginnings are really uh really really
[16:54] interesting how you start that whole
[16:56] project because if that thing is
[16:59] developed ones okay you have all your
[17:02] data with yourself and you can share it
[17:03] then with the hospital but if you start
[17:05] before a hospital then you start from a
[17:08] ground where all the data is now at the
[17:10] hospital and you need like the clients
[17:12] to kind of test it and they have the
[17:15] data uh and then H have testing that one
[17:19] system it's an interesting uh
[17:21] interesting thing so you also need
[17:23] probably patients that come to the
[17:26] hospital and actually willing to to try
[17:29] it with Nostra and and they're like okay
[17:31] let's let's let's see if if that works
[17:33] like that so you don't only need the
[17:34] hospital but also the the patients if
[17:37] I'm right yeah so obviously a hospital
[17:41] or um any any organization has a set of
[17:44] processes that they go to right so if I
[17:47] have if I'm a hospital and I have a new
[17:49] patient then obviously I need to
[17:51] interact with him I need them to I need
[17:53] to capture their information I need them
[17:55] to interact with me as a hospital so
[17:57] that we can communicate
[18:00] so if you say as a hospital as just
[18:03] standard procedure when you come to us
[18:06] what you need to do is you download an
[18:08] application on your phone that
[18:10] application will be the way that we
[18:11] interact with you that will give you we
[18:14] will basically send you the all the
[18:16] information and the data that we could
[18:17] create and on your on your device when
[18:20] we interact we request information you
[18:23] press the buttons on the application
[18:25] blah blah blah blah they don't need to
[18:27] necessarily know that it's based on
[18:28] Noster and they control everything
[18:30] straight away it's just part of the
[18:32] process okay so any if I go to any
[18:36] Hospital there's always a process so
[18:38] what we're doing is we're building this
[18:40] in a way that it becomes part of that
[18:42] process and we're
[18:43] learning how to best interact with the
[18:46] patients how to best interact create the
[18:49] right tools to interface with this
[18:51] protocol that we're building at the same
[18:53] time so that's I guess the philosophy so
[18:57] with um social media like we have right
[19:00] now Noster social media you don't need
[19:02] that it's it's a different story here's
[19:04] an application download it if you want
[19:07] um and and then you know you can use the
[19:09] different features that are being rolled
[19:11] out this is a real world scenario this
[19:14] is real world real patience real
[19:16] interaction and not just oh let's do
[19:19] social media online only this is real
[19:21] world stuff so there's you would almost
[19:24] be I guess ignorant to say I'm I'm just
[19:28] going to develop something without the
[19:29] real world and then expect it to work so
[19:32] what we've done is we've said okay we
[19:34] know all the things that we know we know
[19:37] the infrastructures we know the
[19:38] architecture we know everything like
[19:39] that that we are deploying now let's
[19:42] connect it to the real world once we've
[19:44] done that then we can bring that message
[19:46] to the world and then become open source
[19:48] and everyone can develop on us oh yeah
[19:51] yeah the open source topic is also
[19:53] interesting so you're right now you're
[19:55] uh too small to make it open source or
[19:58] are you already open source there's
[20:01] things that are open source um that
[20:02] things that are available uh that you
[20:04] can see definitely um as well as the
[20:08] same time we're actually as I said
[20:09] defining the finer details of things as
[20:11] well and once we know those then we can
[20:14] actually bring it out to the world I
[20:17] think open source is the key here
[20:20] because
[20:22] um the idea behind the protocol is that
[20:25] once it's out there and it's and it's
[20:27] available that people can start building
[20:28] on it which basically also means that
[20:31] people can start developing on it and
[20:33] develop their own tools and their own
[20:34] things as
[20:35] well so as a result um you're going to
[20:39] get a situation where we were hoping
[20:41] that an existing say software um um
[20:45] tool um that already exists can say oh
[20:49] well maybe what we want to do is we want
[20:51] to interface with this salute protocol
[20:54] because we know that that will give you
[20:56] information we know that will be genuine
[20:58] information we also know that that will
[21:00] be um information that is structured in
[21:03] a specific uh format I don't know if you
[21:06] know about the hl7 stuff um the so in
[21:10] other words these applications then by
[21:13] Design can actually connect with our
[21:15] salute protocol or the salute protocol
[21:17] not necessarily the salute protocol and
[21:20] integrate the salute protocol in their
[21:22] Technologies I hope that other
[21:24] organizations are going to develop build
[21:26] other applications that I don't even
[21:27] know about today right so that's the
[21:30] idea we really want to once we've
[21:32] defined it properly um then we really
[21:35] wanted to push it out into the world and
[21:37] then have everyone just use it develop
[21:40] integrate Etc about you're talking about
[21:43] open source that that's really cool I I
[21:45] love the idea and I think it's it
[21:48] probably takes time till you see this
[21:51] amazing real world examples of how it
[21:53] works I I had this moments um for
[21:57] example Bitcoin always saw as a store of
[21:59] value and uh slowly in the last year one
[22:02] and a half years I developed this
[22:04] Bitcoin oh Bitcoin is also like a
[22:05] payment system it's actually could be a
[22:07] solid currency and the one really
[22:10] amazing moment that I had just a few
[22:12] weeks ago where an American sponsor of
[22:15] me actually paid me in Bitcoin and first
[22:18] I looked at it like oh what it takes to
[22:21] make that transaction from him America
[22:23] to Austria and it's a hurdle rate it's
[22:26] it's expensive it's all the things uh
[22:28] and then we and then I was like with him
[22:30] hey let's let's just do it in Bitcoin uh
[22:33] and then we settled on bitcoin I store
[22:35] it in Bitcoin or everything like that
[22:36] and we did it on a Sunday evening in
[22:39] like I don't know five 10 minutes time
[22:41] or something like that and it was
[22:43] magical like this was this would not
[22:46] even be possible in the Fiat world we
[22:48] would have to wait a week we would have
[22:50] to put a lot of banking numbers routing
[22:53] numbers or anything like that I just
[22:54] sent him a pay link and he paid with
[22:57] that and I think that could happen at
[23:00] some point maybe with the medical data
[23:02] where you have your medical data in El
[23:04] Salvador you fly to a hospital to
[23:06] Austria you give them uh your your
[23:09] access to the data and they already have
[23:11] all the data uh which was previously
[23:14] just in El salador or was not in elav
[23:16] was always with you now that is really
[23:19] complicated because I probably like I
[23:21] have no clue about the world medical
[23:23] datas but I guess that Salvador does not
[23:28] know anything about the Austrian Health
[23:30] Data and V versa so like uh that that is
[23:35] uh those use cases will be amazing to
[23:38] see I think yeah so I guess you did an
[23:42] on onchain transaction obviously when
[23:44] you did that yeah so um and you're in
[23:47] Austria so you don't know what's
[23:49] possible because from my perspective I
[23:52] do at least one Bitcoin transaction a
[23:56] day um and it takes two seconds it
[23:59] doesn't take five to 10 but it's
[24:02] obviously onling right so it's a
[24:03] different story so yeah definitely
[24:05] Bitcoin as a uh a medium of exchange is
[24:09] is a total no-brainer from my
[24:12] perspective one of the reasons that we
[24:14] moved here to experience this new world
[24:16] right this new paradigm of actually
[24:18] paying and yes you're right um I see the
[24:22] future where um the information the
[24:27] health information and how easy it is to
[24:29] access but again controlled by the owner
[24:33] of the information right the My Health
[24:36] identity um I see a future like that and
[24:38] what we're actually doing is inside the
[24:42] uh protocol what we're doing is that the
[24:44] message format the format that the
[24:46] information is structured is based on a
[24:50] global Health standard as well so in the
[24:54] world um and funny enough is I actually
[24:57] was exposed to it when I was still in
[25:00] Australia there is now um like this
[25:03] standard being created it's a standard
[25:05] it's not a not a forced standard is a
[25:07] standard that's is um about how health
[25:12] information is being transmitted the the
[25:14] look of health information the structure
[25:17] of health information if it's about a
[25:18] blood group and a blood type it'll be
[25:21] structured in this way if it's about
[25:22] something else to be structured in that
[25:24] way so the messaging or communication
[25:27] formats uh um that is now being globally
[25:30] adopted and it's been around for I think
[25:31] probably close to 30 years so that is
[25:35] called
[25:36] hl7 and there's a specific part that's
[25:38] called the fire
[25:40] fhir um standard so what we're doing is
[25:43] we're integrating this standard into the
[25:48] protocol that we're building as well so
[25:49] that that information is standardized
[25:52] across the world or across Health what
[25:55] that then means is if I'm in Austria or
[25:57] Viet or wherever in the world that I am
[26:00] right then any interface or standardized
[26:04] um Software System can then easily
[26:07] interface as long as it is inside this
[26:10] global standard which is great right and
[26:13] so that makes transmitting information
[26:15] from say my phone or a relay that I'm
[26:17] accessing somewhere else in the world to
[26:20] the medical system of the doctor that is
[26:23] being in in in in in Austria or whatever
[26:26] it is really really easy because they
[26:28] can talk to each other right so using
[26:30] the salute protocol with that Global you
[26:33] know messaging standard of health
[26:35] information and then yeah it becomes
[26:38] very very easy to just say oh you here
[26:40] you go I can release it to you if you
[26:42] want on my from my phone um or we can
[26:45] connect to a relay over there um and
[26:48] then yeah standards across the board so
[26:51] the cool thing is I think is El Salvador
[26:56] is still very uh man ual in a lot of
[26:59] things so in other words there's a lot
[27:00] of pieces of paper and stuff like that
[27:02] you should see some of the hospital
[27:04] there's all these like manila folders
[27:05] you know hanging in the big archive room
[27:08] so what we're doing is hoping to do is
[27:10] that with what we're building here and
[27:12] we're defining with the pavita hospital
[27:16] here in El Salvador and then integrating
[27:19] this whole Global messaging standard as
[27:22] well health messaging standard as well
[27:25] into that salute protocol that we can
[27:27] just Leap Frog um the existing you know
[27:32] um technologies that are out there out
[27:34] in in the world and that El saor becomes
[27:37] like the health communication
[27:42] Administration uh I guess um leader um
[27:46] as to Rolling that out into the world
[27:48] being an example Etc so yeah it's
[27:52] pretty pretty cool I guess um yeah if
[27:55] you watch or listen to my podcast on
[27:58] regular basis I guess you already bought
[28:00] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[28:03] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[28:06] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[28:09] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[28:11] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[28:13] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[28:15] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[28:18] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[28:22] with the code Robin at the checkout
[28:24] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[28:28] your bitbox and the next step is to
[28:30] really level up your sovereignty as an
[28:33] individual you have to have the most
[28:35] secure self- custody setup you have to
[28:38] secure your own devices you have to
[28:41] protect your privacy you have to set up
[28:44] an inheritance plan and depending on
[28:46] where you live you even want to have a
[28:48] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[28:51] in case something goes really really
[28:53] wrong and through all those steps the
[28:55] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[28:58] step by step and if you visit the
[29:00] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[29:04] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[29:07] out how you can level up your
[29:09] sovereignty and last but not least I
[29:11] have something completely new for you
[29:14] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[29:18] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[29:21] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[29:24] look at that beauty I love it so much
[29:26] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[29:30] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[29:32] way to go out there and show that you
[29:35] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[29:38] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[29:41] dropped a completely new and amazing
[29:44] Genesis edition of their watch
[29:47] collections you have the date of the
[29:49] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[29:52] and of course also the block height and
[29:55] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[29:58] level of detail they put in in this
[30:01] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:03] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:07] down in the descriptions I love those
[30:09] watches so so much really I I love it a
[30:13] lot um one thing
[30:16] um why nostril specifically uh there are
[30:20] a lot of we touched on it a little bit
[30:23] in the uh in the beginning uh but there
[30:25] are a lot of like oh let's build it on
[30:27] bitcoin oh let's build it on uh some own
[30:30] blockchain or let's build it on on
[30:31] something else and I'm always liking
[30:34] when people don't build for something
[30:36] their own blockchain because usually
[30:38] they have some some shitcoin involved
[30:40] and then they just want to make a money
[30:42] grab uh but like what was the uh
[30:45] decision making process to to come to
[30:47] Nostra and why is Nostra uh so much
[30:50] better than than all the other uh
[30:52] technology that which would uh which uh
[30:56] so I think he sort of answered the
[30:58] question already um I think what's
[31:00] happening I mean obviously Bitcoin
[31:02] introduced the blockchain and great and
[31:05] you can do so many things with your
[31:07] identity and data and stuff like that
[31:09] out there and then a lot of these
[31:12] projects became projects that were based
[31:15] on a specific type of
[31:17] functionality right so I had a coin that
[31:20] was built to manage files or I had a
[31:22] coin to build to manage education I a
[31:24] coin to do this or a coin to do this
[31:26] coin to do this and and every single one
[31:29] of those coins they're on the blockchain
[31:32] and they have an Associated blockchain
[31:34] and therefore you need to transact value
[31:37] you know money monetary value at the
[31:39] same time and yeah so that was like okay
[31:44] so it's just basically using the same
[31:46] thing for just different
[31:48] functionalities then Noster came along
[31:51] and in essence they did the same thing
[31:52] you know they had a public and a private
[31:56] key to manage identity and manage
[31:58] control of
[32:00] information um and I'm
[32:03] going okay the only thing is there's no
[32:05] Central organization behind it there's
[32:07] no single point of failure behind it
[32:09] there's no company behind it it's just a
[32:12] protocol out there so it's a bit like
[32:15] Bitcoin no one owns it no one controls
[32:17] it no one does anything like that whilst
[32:20] altcoins are companies behind it Etc and
[32:24] I guess that is basically the the the
[32:27] answer right
[32:28] in my opinion um we can probably take
[32:32] 95% I'm not going to say 100% but a 95%
[32:36] of those tokens and and and projects out
[32:39] there and build it on Noster it's just
[32:43] it's not necessarily the blockchain is
[32:44] not necessary and then secondly I'm now
[32:47] going to be connected to a specific
[32:49] blockchain that I have to work with
[32:52] that's if that blockchain fails for
[32:55] whoever or whatever reason right then we
[32:59] have a problem so now let's do this open
[33:02] source I like open source I like um the
[33:05] idea that no one can control it no one
[33:07] can manipulate it they can manipulate
[33:09] all they want but if they do I can go
[33:12] somewhere else so if you think the
[33:14] relays that I'm actually managing or or
[33:17] controlling um if I don't like them I
[33:19] can go to other relays or set them up
[33:21] some set up some other relays and just
[33:23] keep on going so that's I guess the
[33:25] answer to your question I don't need a
[33:27] blockchain
[33:28] and the other thing is Noster is very
[33:29] cheap to deploy I I don't need money for
[33:32] every single transaction and if this
[33:34] thing is going to work there's going to
[33:36] be a lot of information or a lot of
[33:38] transaction going all over the place so
[33:41] let's keep it
[33:42] cheap and that's a it's a it's a good
[33:44] point do you think that Bitcoin together
[33:49] with the nostr protocol which are like
[33:52] getting more and more deeply integrated
[33:53] with the Bitcoin Community like the
[33:55] hardcore bitcoiners are also all in in
[33:57] Nostra they communicate on the Nostra
[33:59] protocol with social media and they're
[34:01] building other applications like yours
[34:04] also on on that protocol do we think
[34:06] because it's of like oh we fix the money
[34:08] we fix the world but then a lot of
[34:10] people say oh no we we we we don't fix
[34:12] all the the problems of the world but
[34:14] could like Bitcoin and nost together be
[34:16] like a a superow of of protocols that
[34:19] actually um uh to get tackle a lot of
[34:23] the problems like money Deo on privacy
[34:26] and all those things I totally do
[34:29] absolutely um I totally do like I I said
[34:32] Bitcoin gives people the opportunity to
[34:36] opt out of an existing
[34:40] system and choose to interact directly
[34:43] with each
[34:44] other that's one um
[34:48] Noster does exactly the same
[34:51] thing um on a information perspective so
[34:56] I can transmit any kind of information
[34:59] across the Noster protocol and again it
[35:03] is not controlled by anyone not
[35:05] centrally controlled by anyone um so
[35:08] yeah
[35:09] so yeah it's about one money and the
[35:12] other one is information I think you
[35:14] could almost make a case that what we're
[35:17] trying to do or what we're doing is
[35:19] we're actually creating like as I said a
[35:22] health protocol right using the nost
[35:29] um protocol as as its foundation part of
[35:32] what we're doing is we're also
[35:33] integrating the Bitcoin aspect to it
[35:36] because obviously health information is
[35:38] valuable so there can be an opportunity
[35:42] for people to use that health
[35:44] information and then I guess get some
[35:46] sort of feed back into um into the
[35:50] individual for sharing their information
[35:52] their health information because we
[35:54] still need to you know understand
[35:56] statistics do anal is all that kind of
[35:58] stuff but now I have an ability to say
[36:00] okay well I am going to the patient
[36:03] saying I am interested in your
[36:05] information are you willing to share it
[36:07] and the patient says no because I hate
[36:09] you as a company and I will never do it
[36:11] or you can say the company can say I am
[36:15] willing I want my information are you
[36:16] willing and then you say yes because I
[36:18] trust you as an organization and I like
[36:20] what you're doing and therefore I am
[36:22] willing to share it they don't have to
[36:24] know it's me but my information I can
[36:26] still share it so all of a sudden the
[36:29] power of information and remember this
[36:32] information is controlled by me so I
[36:35] know it is 100% genuine and no one
[36:38] manipulated it right so it's now very
[36:40] valuable as well at the same time but I
[36:43] now has a patient have control over the
[36:46] people that wants my information and are
[36:48] interested in my
[36:50] information and I have also so much
[36:52] control that they have to ask me for it
[36:56] whilst right now they just take it from
[36:57] you right now that information is just
[36:59] out there they take it they control it
[37:02] they sell it whatever and again I keep
[37:05] on saying to everyone the number from
[37:06] what I understand right now is health
[37:09] information is valued at about a$2
[37:12] trillion dollar globally that's a lot of
[37:14] money now I don't see that you don't see
[37:17] that but they're taking it from us so
[37:20] yeah so definitely
[37:22] Bitcoin disc or decentralized or or
[37:25] money and then health information or
[37:29] information as a whole Noster and then
[37:31] what we're putting on is a layer which
[37:34] is basically health information on that
[37:36] Noster protocol I guess you could say
[37:38] that what we're building is almost like
[37:40] a layer two on Noster is it also done
[37:43] possible to to get paid for for sharing
[37:46] your uh Medical Data directly and not
[37:51] some some company uh as you said the two
[37:53] two trillions that we never see but uh
[37:56] they still want to do things and they
[37:58] can maybe say like oh yeah like for
[38:00] every set of data we take this this
[38:02] amount of of ss is that is that could
[38:05] that be reality where we actually get
[38:08] paid for sharing information with with
[38:10] doctors and and companies that's part of
[38:13] what we're
[38:13] building I love that it's an interesting
[38:17] idea where like the again we like with
[38:19] Bitcoin we have the central bank and
[38:21] then we have uh this this decentralizing
[38:25] the Central Bank uh and all of this the
[38:27] individual benefits from it the most and
[38:30] the same with that what you building
[38:33] where the individual is benefiting the
[38:36] most I think I slowly slowly get it what
[38:38] what you're doing so thank you for
[38:40] explaining to me very nicely I'm really
[38:43] cool I love that um one thing that I
[38:46] also uh want to get into a little bit
[38:49] with you uh is uh how it has been for
[38:52] you that you move to El Salvador so you
[38:56] came from what you said
[38:58] Australia yeah I'm originally from the
[39:00] Netherlands and I moved to austr I heard
[39:04] it yeah uh originally from the
[39:07] Netherlands actually I went skiing in um
[39:10] in Austria for the first time in my life
[39:12] when I was eight or six or something yes
[39:15] a little place called Maria I think it
[39:18] was that could be one yeah the the they
[39:22] they have those kind of names yeah some
[39:25] on there but yeah cool you have been
[39:28] Netherlands Australia um and uh you
[39:31] already covered why you moved there but
[39:34] how has it been uh since then uh in in
[39:36] the three years what did you see of of
[39:39] Salvador what also maybe you see from
[39:42] people that still live in Netherlands
[39:44] still live in Australia and they are
[39:46] seeing from from El salador and how this
[39:48] is different to what you are actually
[39:50] seeing in elav um so we've been here a
[39:53] year and a half um and things are
[39:57] changing rapidly here um I mean the
[40:00] amount of development and growth and and
[40:04] uh in this country is crazy um mean
[40:07] development everywhere shopping centers
[40:09] being built it
[40:10] is amazing to see the change we can see
[40:13] the change but it's also not just
[40:15] development I mean it is also the fact
[40:17] that on the beach we have now places to
[40:21] put your garbage six seven eight months
[40:23] ago that didn't exist so not only is it
[40:26] the development it's also that the place
[40:28] is cleaning up and and and people are
[40:31] hopeful and people are excited about the
[40:33] future and looking to forward to the
[40:35] future and the other thing is there's a
[40:37] lot of people that I think come here
[40:38] that say wow I really like it you mean
[40:41] this is where we can sort of not worry
[40:44] about what we're saying to others you
[40:46] know we're free to talk about things
[40:48] we're open to talk about things um which
[40:51] is very different that was at least when
[40:53] I met left Australia it was very much
[40:55] like I have to be careful with what I
[40:57] say because I might defend someone blah
[40:59] blah blah and over here no it's it's
[41:01] it's very open very free um and the
[41:05] country is working really hard to um
[41:09] improve itself and improve the world I I
[41:13] believe um and I say this often I
[41:16] believe that El Salvador is the
[41:19] epicenter of the new financial and
[41:23] technological Global Paradigm what is
[41:26] happening
[41:27] here financi in the from a financial
[41:30] World perspective and from a technology
[41:33] perspective is quite amazing it's a
[41:36] small little country there's a lot of
[41:38] freedom a lot of opportunity for
[41:41] entrepreneurial type thinking and we are
[41:44] clearly moving from what I can see into
[41:47] a world that is far more about self-
[41:50] sovereignty decentralization Etc and
[41:54] this country is leading it
[41:56] so it's an awesome place I mean what's
[41:58] Happening Here is is is great obviously
[42:01] a lot to do with what Buel is doing and
[42:04] how he's approaching everything um and
[42:06] he's pretty blunt I mean I don't know if
[42:08] you saw his uh um speech at the United
[42:11] Nations um he's yeah you know it's he he
[42:16] says that most big part of the world is
[42:18] going down a very dark path so somewhere
[42:21] we need to actually start building the
[42:24] lights and creating the lights and it
[42:26] definitely feels like that um over here
[42:28] and Elsa over and I am loving it I can
[42:31] tell you I am loving the the enthusiasm
[42:35] the hope the
[42:36] opportunity um and I made the move or we
[42:41] made the move a year and a half ago and
[42:43] I am very very very grateful for having
[42:46] done that so um yeah I think that
[42:48] answers your question right it it was
[42:52] beautiful it this is the reason um why I
[42:56] have to visit as and I will be visiting
[42:59] adopting Bitcoin by the way if anyone
[43:00] wants a ticket there's code Robin I
[43:02] think you get like 10% off the ticket uh
[43:05] but yeah I'm really really looking
[43:07] forward to to adopting Bitcoin and
[43:09] looking forward to meeting all those uh
[43:11] people finally in person because I have
[43:13] been interviewing so many from there and
[43:15] they all uh talk so highly about it and
[43:19] I was at this point I'm like I can't
[43:21] okay I cannot interview more El
[43:23] salvadorians and not go there like I at
[43:26] least have to
[43:27] it Lees to have to check it out for like
[43:29] a week that's that's what I own my my
[43:31] guest said have been on my podcast so
[43:34] many times and I think that's it will be
[43:37] a great time uh it will be it will be
[43:40] probably a really really cool time I I'm
[43:42] feeling um a little bit anxious I have a
[43:46] big fear that I might not want to leave
[43:48] El Salvador again so that might happen
[43:51] let's see um the funny thing
[43:54] is that two I hear is common that's
[43:58] people come over here experience the the
[44:00] whole thing and go wow I didn't know
[44:03] life was going to be so awesome and and
[44:07] you know things could be so cool and I
[44:08] could share so many ideas and hope and
[44:11] all that kind of stuff and again I mean
[44:13] it's like bua said you know the lot of
[44:17] the world is going down a dark path and
[44:19] if you live there and you feel that and
[44:22] you come to this place and you go wow
[44:24] this is so exciting there's lots of
[44:25] things to do and people excited and
[44:27] hopeful and building and yeah then that
[44:30] obviously is going to rub off um I think
[44:33] people generally sort of feel more
[44:35] attracted to positive things than
[44:38] negative things because it makes them
[44:39] happy right it's like a a drug if you
[44:42] want to make happy and then you're
[44:43] surrounded by people that are happy then
[44:45] you too become happy and but the other
[44:48] way around as well you know if people
[44:49] are negative and yeah okay who said it
[44:52] like that I think the the financial Dark
[44:55] Ages we in the dark Financial age es and
[44:58] this uh Dark Age is is strling down to
[45:01] so many other things and it's it's great
[45:04] to see that there are places with hope
[45:06] and places that Embrace Bitcoin and not
[45:09] just like ah we should regulate it you
[45:12] should not be able to do self- custody
[45:14] or like do the nonk exchange like that
[45:17] that whole BS that's going on in the EU
[45:20] uh I'm not a big fan of obviously uh and
[45:25] it's not at this point where
[45:27] I feel like pushed out of Austria but I
[45:31] see a lot of countries where the
[45:33] incentive is Big to to go there but uh
[45:36] there might be the point in AA where I
[45:38] get pushed out because I really dislike
[45:42] politics that's why I also think that
[45:44] it's important for bitcoiners to at
[45:47] least be aware of your local politicians
[45:50] and local politics what's going on
[45:52] because even though Bitcoin doesn't care
[45:55] about politics but politics cares about
[45:57] you uh and that's why it's in important
[46:00] to at least look like where are you
[46:03] because your physical body is still here
[46:05] uh and they can do a lot to you but not
[46:07] to your piton yeah that's that's I think
[46:09] uh important for people also know I
[46:12] think um yeah and you actually
[46:14] highlighted something that I often
[46:15] mention as well is for hundreds of years
[46:18] we lived or thousands of years or
[46:19] however long we've lived in a world
[46:21] where um my physical body um is is is
[46:27] the main reason of doing things and the
[46:29] main I guess things that we built our
[46:32] our our our our um societal Frameworks
[46:35] around right so in other words the
[46:37] physical body is like I can go somewhere
[46:40] and if I don't like it then I can remove
[46:42] myself from from that place right um I
[46:47] mean I'm thinking about loud with you
[46:49] now as well you know in the US we have
[46:51] the right to bear arms to defend against
[46:53] ourselves against oppression of the
[46:55] governments and all that kind of stuff
[46:56] it's all in the physical world it's
[46:58] physical type world uh stuff that we're
[47:01] talking about because the world and
[47:04] Society is now I believe more hybrid you
[47:07] know we have a digital world and we have
[47:10] a physical
[47:11] world if we apply physical world type
[47:14] thinking to a digital world then that's
[47:18] not going to fully work I can make all
[47:20] these wonderful laws about how it should
[47:23] be and how it shouldn't be but in the
[47:26] digital world yeah you know it's it's
[47:28] it's not a good way to be able to
[47:31] control or manage them so in other words
[47:33] they can even overtake them so if we can
[47:37] build the tools that allow us to do the
[47:39] same like in the digital world as we
[47:41] were in the physical world where we
[47:42] control our physical bodies in the
[47:45] physical world and our digital bodies or
[47:48] our digital identities in the digital
[47:50] world then all of a sudden things can
[47:52] change so we need to have the tools in
[47:55] the digital world just like we have in
[47:56] the phys physical world in the physical
[47:58] world I can walk away I can shoot you I
[48:00] can do all that kind of stuff right but
[48:02] in the digital world we can't now what
[48:04] we're doing and what Noster doing as
[48:05] Bitcoin is doing is actually creating
[48:07] that ability to do the same thing where
[48:09] if I say I don't like what you're doing
[48:11] or I don't like that company I'm not
[48:12] going to give them anything or anything
[48:14] like that and I can remove myself and go
[48:16] somewhere else just like the physical
[48:18] world if we can create the tools in the
[48:21] digital space to do that then all of a
[48:23] sudden we then have an equal footing
[48:24] again that's not where the most digital
[48:27] world is right now so that's what we're
[48:29] building that's what Bitcoin is about
[48:30] that's what Noster is about that's I
[48:32] think what blockchain is trying to
[48:33] achieve but there's that issue with
[48:36] centralization so yeah I believe what
[48:40] we're doing is we're we're creating that
[48:42] ability that we have in the physical
[48:43] world in the digital world and say I
[48:45] don't like you see you later I love it
[48:47] too much I love it too much really
[48:48] really cool um I want to end with uh
[48:52] with the end routine now uh there's two
[48:54] questions one question is always the
[48:55] same for each guest
[48:57] uh and the guest is the question I
[49:00] always uh modified a little bit what can
[49:03] we learn from you besides Bitcoin and
[49:07] Nostra and all those things like what
[49:08] what else can we learn from you besides
[49:10] all the things that we already talked
[49:11] about I think the the first thing that
[49:14] comes to mind is is there are always
[49:17] ways to achieve what we want to do for
[49:23] me um freedom is important um for me
[49:28] being control of myself is important so
[49:30] there's always ways to be able to
[49:32] achieve what what you do and if there's
[49:34] anything else I would say always look
[49:37] for the positive sides and what you
[49:40] learn out of any situation that you come
[49:43] across with I say to my daughter and she
[49:46] fell off her skateboard and got blood
[49:48] everywhere I'm going to
[49:50] go wonderful that blood and you might
[49:52] think it's cool but what did you learn
[49:55] what did you learn so always learn and
[49:58] look for the
[49:59] positives by the way as you're also uh
[50:02] originally from the Netherlands are you
[50:04] visiting uh Bitcoin Amsterdam in in
[50:06] October no I'm not we're pretty busy
[50:09] over here um we've got a lot of stuff to
[50:11] do with the conference over here um we
[50:14] are actually doing a uh discussion panel
[50:17] um at the conference over here about
[50:19] what we're building and what we're
[50:21] creating um so organizing that and um
[50:26] yeah we're we're just too busy doing
[50:28] stuff and as much as I'd love to go all
[50:31] over the place you have to sort of be
[50:33] you know I have a project here with a
[50:35] local company with a local hospital
[50:38] let's focus on that um but no but maybe
[50:41] next year who knows really really cool
[50:44] yeah uh I will see you in in El Sal
[50:46] anyway so one one month afterwards uh
[50:49] really cool perfect then uh let's come
[50:51] to our endro tetin where the previous
[50:53] guest is asking a question for the next
[50:55] guest and it's a very Brad question you
[50:57] can take it in uh whatever Direction you
[50:59] want to take the question uh where do
[51:02] you see Bitcoin in 2050 uh where do I
[51:05] see Bitcoin in 2050 I think I so 2050 is
[51:09] 25 years from now I think that half of
[51:14] the world will be using
[51:16] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and also
[51:21] a unit of
[51:22] accounts oh really cool I think if half
[51:25] of the world like every second person is
[51:28] is kind of using it then we are like
[51:30] almost at hyperbitcoinization at that
[51:32] point I think there then there's like uh
[51:35] really huge huge step already taken yeah
[51:37] really really cool perfect thank you so
