[00:00] What you have in the United States,
[00:01] which I've been missing in Europe, is
[00:03] massive amount of creativity constantly
[00:05] and willingness to challenge old ideas.
[00:08] Everybody can be his own bank. You're my
[00:11] buddy. Let's hammer something out. And
[00:13] we use other people's investors or
[00:16] government money to enrich ourself.
[00:18] That's the system we are talking about
[00:20] here. And I was back then and so I'm
[00:22] today highly disgusted by that. But to
[00:25] think that there is this like central
[00:27] banker uh who going to bail you out like
[00:30] Powell or like G in Europe or some
[00:32] politician. People are being paid a lot
[00:34] of money than the front page of all the
[00:37] newspaper and they have no freaking idea
[00:40] what's going on. I think if you want to
[00:41] create wealth for people uh in my view
[00:44] that's the best option for everybody to
[00:47] to do that for everyone independent of
[00:49] the amount of money they have.
[00:53] [Music]
[00:55] you have a really fascinating background
[00:57] and for for the few people that might
[00:59] not know you and not aware of of what
[01:01] you're doing uh give us some some of
[01:03] your backgrounds. What are you doing,
[01:04] who you are and and why you're excited
[01:06] about uh Bitcoin? Sure. Well, my
[01:09] background is um I used to start in
[01:13] academia. So I studied math, physics,
[01:16] major in math, did my PhD in mathematics
[01:19] and uh after deciding that academia is
[01:23] not really the the path I want to take
[01:25] forward, I decided to join banking,
[01:27] investment banking in the '90s uh in a
[01:30] trading arm of of of an investment bank.
[01:34] Um, and from that I sort of like ended
[01:38] up on Wall Street uh doing the subprime
[01:41] prices and actually trading subprime
[01:43] derivatives. So I've been in the
[01:45] trenches
[01:46] um of but you when you watch the movie
[01:49] the big shot uh my direct boss was Ryan
[01:53] Gosling. So I was part of his trading
[01:55] team. I was his number two uh trading
[01:57] out of London. very exciting times and
[02:01] uh first time as well where I could see
[02:03] something is broken in the system um as
[02:06] a banker you don't really ask this
[02:08] questions and later on I worked out um a
[02:11] bad bank of Deuts bank for many years or
[02:13] for a couple of years in order then to
[02:16] um worked the last few years of my
[02:19] career for Keritch Shell where I was
[02:22] like head structure advisor to Howard
[02:25] Lutnik who was CEO back then CEO and
[02:28] chairman of kind of a shel uh who now is
[02:31] a commerce secretary of the United
[02:32] States. Um and Bitcoin journey because
[02:36] it's of course your show started in my
[02:40] case in a bit of a different way. I I I
[02:42] was uh the I think day one investor of
[02:46] Europe's by now I would say most
[02:48] prominent trading platform not just
[02:51] Bitcoin across different tokens. um an
[02:54] Austrian an Austrian firm and back then
[02:57] already before I got invested uh one of
[03:01] the key members of this firm actually
[03:03] told me an an old friend of mine even
[03:06] he's much much younger said here why
[03:09] don't you get involved in Bitcoin it's
[03:10] an exciting asset class and um so like I
[03:14] looked into that I I read the uh the
[03:16] white paper and interesting enough work
[03:19] in Wall Street in New York in 2013 I
[03:22] think it was 20 Yeah, 2013 some of our
[03:25] traders on the shining test that
[03:27] were sitting in the back of me they
[03:29] actually trade the PA means for the
[03:31] personal personal account not for the
[03:33] bank. The bank didn't allow that.
[03:35] Obviously, Bitcoin and why? Well,
[03:38] traders like volatility and uh this
[03:42] Bitcoin, which nobody really knew what
[03:44] it was, went up like 50%, down 30%, up
[03:48] 200%, they loved it. It was like at back
[03:50] then at like 100, went to 400, down to
[03:52] 50. Nobody knew. So, I thought like,
[03:56] well, that's that's that's an
[03:57] interesting asset class. And because I
[03:59] didn't really have a directional view
[04:01] regarding Bitcoin, I decided to actually
[04:04] get involved via my investment in this
[04:07] company, which is a brokerage firm.
[04:09] That's my personal background as a Wall
[04:11] Street trader. I don't really care
[04:13] whether the market goes up or down. What
[04:15] I want to see is a lot of volatility.
[04:18] That's where we make the money. So, I
[04:20] thought like that's the best way without
[04:22] even have a view whether it's going to
[04:24] go to the moon or go to zero. Well, that
[04:26] view then clearly has changed over the
[04:28] years. I spent much more time thinking
[04:31] about Bitcoin, reading up on Bitcoin,
[04:34] uh, watching podcasts like like yours
[04:37] and uh, sort of like um got involved on
[04:41] even like in in a in in a
[04:43] straightforward manner and uh, turned to
[04:46] something but we'll say well I wouldn't
[04:48] say Bitcoin max. I think that's terms
[04:50] you guys use but just say I think if you
[04:52] want to create wealth for people uh in
[04:56] my view that's the best option for
[04:58] everybody to to do that for everyone
[05:02] independent of the amount of money they
[05:03] have. It's fascinating uh to talk with
[05:07] people that have firsthand experience
[05:08] with the 2008 and the the the film uh
[05:11] the big short I think I saw it two or
[05:13] like two and a half times or something
[05:15] like that. It's it's a great movie. How
[05:18] was it being there and and and seeing
[05:21] that and and how this probably impacted
[05:23] you a lot in the the first time you kind
[05:25] of understood Bitcoin because you saw
[05:27] the flaw in the system probably better.
[05:30] Absolutely. So, um I will even go back a
[05:33] bit earlier. Why was a guy like me hired
[05:36] by an investment bank in the '9s? I
[05:39] never really had the per I was not
[05:42] interested in financial affairs at all.
[05:45] I remember when I was interviewed by by
[05:47] the bank they said well we've never
[05:49] experienced a guy who so knows so little
[05:51] about anything like you guy but somehow
[05:54] I was like a math guy I understood math
[05:57] reasonable well and models and back then
[06:00] the belief was if you enter into a
[06:02] derivative and I say that in a second
[06:04] what it is uh then you need actually qu
[06:08] mathematical geeks what I believed on
[06:11] Wall Street in order to to price these
[06:14] have risk to evaluate these type of
[06:16] contracts, complex contracts. But the
[06:18] interesting part about derivatives is
[06:21] they've been around since the forever
[06:24] the futures market but like the OTC the
[06:27] off market the overthe-counter
[06:29] derivatives are around since the 80s
[06:31] late 80s and pretty much it means let's
[06:33] assume Robin you and I enter into a
[06:35] contract and we can say
[06:38] okay interest rate contract I gonna pay
[06:41] you for the next 10 years 4% fixed and
[06:45] you pay to me three months
[06:49] rate every three months is being reset.
[06:51] So of course I know my outlay for next
[06:54] 10 years and you yeah if rates are
[06:57] rising you lose if rates are falling you
[06:59] gain. So and this is the symbols of
[07:02] derivatives and uh in order to price
[07:05] this transaction in order to trade this
[07:07] transaction you need sort of like people
[07:09] understand mathematics or physics or
[07:12] astrophysics um like reasonable value
[07:16] that was the premises of the idea.
[07:18] Interesting as well this system is based
[07:21] on trust. So you and I enter into a
[07:23] contract and now you and I sort of like
[07:25] understand what the valuation is. We
[07:29] because on a daily basis there going to
[07:31] be exchange of money. If I'm in the
[07:34] money so my contract is up you have to
[07:36] wire money to me. If it's if in your
[07:39] favor I have to money to you. So it's
[07:40] like a trust system. So what happened
[07:43] then in the financial crisis and by the
[07:45] way it was it was something which the
[07:48] Fed was was actually and the central
[07:51] bank of of the United States was very
[07:53] proud of developing in the '9s. Alan
[07:55] Greenspan I think he gave this very
[07:57] famous speech in n I think 99 where he
[08:00] said thanks to the innovation in
[08:02] derivatives market which he didn't want
[08:05] to
[08:06] regulate we are able to actually
[08:10] smoothen our financial system because we
[08:12] are able to unbundle the risk and
[08:15] distribute it to different people that
[08:17] was the theory which blew up in the face
[08:20] big time uh so what happened then in
[08:23] 20056 was
[08:26] after the uh after the dotcom shock, the
[08:30] first big shock for I think for many
[08:32] many years for the US capital markets,
[08:35] uh rates were lower and everybody got
[08:37] involved in the property market. Bill
[08:39] Clinton came up with this like what he
[08:42] thought a good idea in '90s that every
[08:44] cap driver should own his own house. But
[08:47] somehow if you're a cap driver,
[08:49] self-employed cap driver as an example,
[08:52] you don't have the means to buy a house.
[08:53] So therefore he said well we have to
[08:55] lower our lending standard that's called
[08:57] a subprime market um not sub crime which
[09:02] some people say was the same uh so prime
[09:05] market so pretty much lending to people
[09:08] with not great uh credit score or no
[09:11] credit score at all. Um and that was the
[09:14] asset class I traded then. Um so I
[09:17] worked for Mong Stanley, I went to
[09:19] Lehman Brothers and in 0405 I went to
[09:22] Deutsch Bank where I worked for Craig
[09:25] Clipman Alias Ryan Gosling big short and
[09:29] my my my uh task was to develop the
[09:32] derivatives market for
[09:34] subprime which uh I did um and we traded
[09:39] a lot back and forth like so like
[09:42] selling the risk buying the risk in any
[09:45] action. But what we could see early on
[09:49] was there's a crack in in in this market
[09:52] because this market is much more riskier
[09:55] than people believe. So we start betting
[09:58] crack and I working for him against
[10:01] against this market. So our view was
[10:04] ultimately this market will collapse. We
[10:06] didn't really expect it's going to go
[10:08] the way it went, but we expect that if
[10:11] it there's massive risk and we
[10:13] communicated very clearly and openly to
[10:15] investors. It's like the parallels to
[10:17] Bitcoin is quite interesting. So very
[10:19] open. We say guys, I think there is a
[10:22] risk. We end the business to make
[10:24] markets. So we buy and we sell. But you
[10:27] guys want to be a bit more careful
[10:29] because ultimately it's highly
[10:31] concentrated the same risk. And now it's
[10:35] interesting. The biggest bank, Wall
[10:37] Street bank, with the smartest people
[10:39] and highest paid traders, they were
[10:42] always like, "No, no, that's going to go
[10:44] up. It's going to go on forever." So,
[10:46] we've seen massive trading volume,
[10:49] massive interest in this product from
[10:52] all the investors. But we didn't have
[10:54] even enough cash bonds to satisfy the
[10:58] demand which was out there. So, that's
[11:00] where I came in. I created derivatives.
[11:03] So in a synthetic version if you say for
[11:06] example Robin you say I want to have
[11:09] exposure to this subprime bond now we
[11:12] don't have don't don't have the bond but
[11:14] I say listen now the problem I going to
[11:17] give you to you in durance format which
[11:19] means I pay you whatever the subprime
[11:22] pay bond pays but if the bond defaults
[11:24] then you pay me yeah the recovery rate
[11:28] like one minus recovery rate or 100 back
[11:30] so it's like an insurance contract
[11:32] that's the market I I developed and
[11:35] others Goldman Sachs, Bear Stones um as
[11:38] well working with these firms together
[11:41] to develop this market and what happened
[11:43] in the financial crisis was it's quite
[11:46] interesting. It's not dissimilar I think
[11:48] from today. There was a tremendous
[11:51] liquidity in the market in 2005 6.
[11:54] Nobody could see how could anything go
[11:56] wrong. But now I come to the point of
[11:59] trust. Suddenly people realize, wow,
[12:01] this subprime bonds there seem to be
[12:05] more risky than we thought. It started
[12:07] like 200 of
[12:10] 2006. So just before a couple of months
[12:14] earlier, we entered into this massive
[12:15] transaction with Mong Stanley. It's
[12:17] public. So I can say that it's even in
[12:19] the book in the movie, you can see this
[12:22] big trade. I work for Deutsche Bank
[12:25] versus Mong Stanley. And uh so they say
[12:28] we want to own 3 billion of that
[12:30] risk. And we say okay fine we give you
[12:33] three billion not in bonds in derives
[12:35] format. That's what I did. Uh for that
[12:38] we have to pay you every year around 72
[12:40] half million. But if that goes wrong you
[12:42] have to pay us potentially the full
[12:44] amount. Now the film I think talks about
[12:46] that we ended up with like uh I think we
[12:49] paid about 12 million plus minus over
[12:53] one and a half years and they had to pay
[12:54] us more than 2.9 billion. So I think
[12:57] that's the biggest gain for Deutsche
[12:59] Bank in history. Uh so and and crack got
[13:02] paid accordingly uh according to the
[13:05] movie not so much me unfortunately but
[13:08] yeah um so it worked out but that's an
[13:11] interesting part as well which we can go
[13:13] to in the Bitcoin story when it happened
[13:16] this big trade between us Stanley we
[13:19] were really really happy we're like high
[13:21] five we are better than these guys from
[13:24] the other side these from these
[13:26] arrogant banks and blah blah blah but
[13:29] suddenly we realize it's like in a in a
[13:31] plane. We were right, but it looks like
[13:34] the whole system collapses. So from like
[13:37] being so happy and high five, we got
[13:41] really nervous. Anxiety kicked in for
[13:44] all of us to say that there's no winner,
[13:47] which why do I say that? I know Bitcoin
[13:50] maxi talk about the end of the world and
[13:52] like you do not want to have this
[13:54] scenario. There's no winner. Even the
[13:55] guy who is right is ultimately the
[13:57] loser. So and and what happened at the
[13:59] end of the day and during that time I I
[14:04] realized the system is massively broken
[14:06] and one thing I've seen Robin is
[14:08] interesting that the subprime market
[14:10] which people back then like thought is a
[14:13] big thing was only one and a half
[14:15] trillion market it's not really a big
[14:18] market it's like when you think about I
[14:20] think the investable wealth is like 500
[14:22] trillion 600 trillion numbers are all
[14:24] over the map up to 900 trillion I see
[14:27] different numbers So it was like 1 and a
[14:29] half trillion maybe back then the global
[14:32] v was like 250 300 trillion. So it was a
[14:35] fraction but what happened is the trust
[14:38] amongst the players uh broke down
[14:41] because we had all this derivatives
[14:43] contracts and nobody knew anymore who
[14:45] had which exposure. The banks didn't
[14:48] know, management didn't know and
[14:50] suddenly we say we are not entering and
[14:52] that's the worst thing we are not
[14:53] entering into a transaction with this
[14:55] bank or this company XY Z because we
[14:58] think they have an exposure. No, they
[15:00] turn around and say well we don't trust
[15:02] these guys. So suddenly from like a
[15:04] system built on trust in literally no
[15:07] time you have no trust. It's such an
[15:10] opposite to bitcoin where actually the
[15:12] foundation is a trustless systems which
[15:15] is hard to break or if at all I don't
[15:17] think it's the you can break it banking
[15:20] is a trust business and trust can
[15:24] disappear in a nanocond one incident one
[15:28] weird things some people say wow what's
[15:30] what's happening and wall street
[15:32] operates like that wall street is like
[15:33] this this shy idea right like oh what's
[15:36] happening is running away the other
[15:37] direction and there is no market
[15:39] anymore. It just breaks down. And I
[15:42] think I think that was was my
[15:43] realization. And then to to finish the
[15:46] uh uh the the question in lengthy way,
[15:49] what I learned as well during this
[15:51] situation was the following. The belief
[15:53] in senior people in the upper echolons,
[15:57] they know exactly what's going on. I
[15:59] think that's on the maternal level.
[16:01] People believing in their government,
[16:04] believing in like these people, co CEOs,
[16:06] companies know exactly what's going on.
[16:08] they're going to steer or central
[16:10] bankers they're going to steer the whole
[16:12] ship into the right direction. Well,
[16:13] what I could see we were trading from
[16:16] the morning to the evening working
[16:18] around the clock totally stressed out
[16:20] the trailers. But when I looked towards
[16:22] the corner offices where all the the big
[16:25] big cheese were sitting in the corner
[16:26] office they were staring at the black at
[16:29] the at the at the Bloomberg tunnels and
[16:32] I could see and talking to some of them
[16:34] they had no clue what was going on. They
[16:36] were shocked. Politicians were shocked.
[16:39] Central bankers were shocked. There was
[16:41] the you couldn't really expect any help.
[16:43] And ultimately the system was bailed out
[16:46] which in my view was massive mistake. I
[16:48] would have lost everything but that's
[16:49] fine back then. But I think the belief
[16:54] that somebody knows what's going on.
[16:57] It's it's it's I think that's that's
[16:59] just wrong. I think you have to you can
[17:01] only trust yourself and be accountable
[17:04] for your own actions. Um and you will
[17:06] make a lot of mistakes on the way. But
[17:08] to think that there is this like central
[17:11] banker uh who gonna bail you out like PO
[17:14] or like uh Lagard in Europe or some
[17:17] politician. Um I think that's what I
[17:20] learned back then firsthand. People are
[17:22] being paid a lot of money. They're the
[17:24] front page of all the newspaper and they
[17:27] have no freaking idea what's going on. I
[17:30] love that. And it it's so interesting
[17:32] because uh the most of my guests agree
[17:35] with that and most of my viewers and
[17:37] audience probably also agrees with that.
[17:39] But if you step out of the Bitcoin
[17:41] bubble um you you really see that people
[17:46] trust in those central bankers and the
[17:48] bankers they know what they're doing.
[17:49] They have the university degrees. They
[17:52] they have been in banking since 10 20 50
[17:54] years whatever the the number is and
[17:57] they really trust in in those systems.
[17:59] I'm I'm always boggled by like h how
[18:03] high the confidence of normal people
[18:05] still is in in that those papers in
[18:08] those institutions when we have seen so
[18:10] many times in history that you you
[18:12] cannot trust it like the the the the
[18:15] evidence is really like really stacked
[18:18] against them kind of
[18:20] it is always and um one thing I think
[18:25] capital markets is a powerful it's
[18:27] capital markets for me is a bit Like
[18:29] Bitcoin, it's a very powerful, very
[18:32] resilient beast. Wall Street is a very
[18:34] powerful and resilient beast. Why?
[18:37] Because these guys, because everybody
[18:40] does whatever they do, trade and show
[18:42] and yel in the old days, especially if
[18:45] markets blow up, then like a lot of
[18:48] firms go under, a lot of Wall Street
[18:50] firms go under. If you go into the list
[18:52] of like the big Wall Street firms from
[18:54] the 70s, you won't find apart from
[18:56] Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley just
[18:59] made it any any other firm which was
[19:02] around back then. And Mong Stani and
[19:04] Goldman Sachs, let's face it, they got
[19:06] bailed out. So otherwise that wouldn't
[19:07] exh exist as well. So but they're
[19:10] constantly invent themselves. They
[19:12] always get involved in new things.
[19:13] They're just and I love that they move
[19:15] from A to B to C. And what's great about
[19:18] about Wall Street and that's not
[19:20] dissimilar from from bit from the
[19:22] Bitcoin scene, you can be a little guy
[19:24] at Wall Street. So I was like a very
[19:27] very like I was old in terms of age but
[19:30] very junior in ter of ranks when I
[19:32] started there in the 90s. But you can
[19:34] become very successful yourself by being
[19:37] successful trader by uh uh doing the
[19:40] like be hot nose and doing something and
[19:44] everybody does his own little thing and
[19:46] it doesn't matter whether you're like
[19:48] the senior managing director or you're
[19:50] an analyst you can make as much money as
[19:52] this back then not true anymore uh as a
[19:54] senior guy. What unfortunately happened
[19:57] and that has changed after the financial
[19:59] crisis. Governments thought and
[20:02] regulator thought let's do let's fix
[20:04] this problem of Wall Street by actually
[20:06] imposing more regulation which is
[20:08] insane. Uh so what was the outcome? I
[20:11] think the outcome is that we have much
[20:14] more systemic risk today than back then
[20:17] because one thing which hardly anybody
[20:20] knows the banking system and here now I
[20:23] talk from as a former
[20:25] insider is covered by apparently like
[20:28] very strict rules how financial rules
[20:32] risk mitigation rules and risk
[20:34] management so therefore you should trust
[20:36] the system and it's being set up in a
[20:38] way and I think hardly anybody know is
[20:42] uh there is this there is a firm which
[20:45] is owned by all the central banks around
[20:47] the world. It's called BIS, Bank for
[20:50] International Settlement based in Basil,
[20:52] Switzerland. People like wouldn't even
[20:54] know what is that. Well,
[20:57] this institution actually is responsible
[21:00] for like the regulatory framework for
[21:02] banks, how much capital they have to
[21:04] have, how the models have to run and so
[21:07] on. So therefore you might have read in
[21:10] in in financial news things like battle
[21:12] one two and three and three and a half.
[21:15] So these rules actually is quite
[21:18] interesting lead to the fact that all
[21:20] the banks tend on buying the same crap
[21:24] at the end of the day because they look
[21:26] it looks great under this model which
[21:28] being designed by this like committee
[21:31] and the interesting thing is like there
[21:33] is one asset class which always has the
[21:35] best treatment because this committee
[21:38] defines risk weighted assets. So is if a
[21:40] bank buys an asset, it gets a risk
[21:42] waiting. And it means if you have 100%
[21:45] risk waiting, you buy for example 100
[21:47] million of a bond or loan, that means
[21:50] and you have a risk waiting of 100, it
[21:52] means you have 100 million of risk
[21:55] against 100 million of risk, you have to
[21:57] have right now it's like say 10 million
[22:00] of equity capital. One asset class has
[22:04] zero risk rating which means you can
[22:05] have almost as much as you want.
[22:08] government
[22:09] bonds. Hardly anybody knows banks tend
[22:12] to blow up actually on government bonds
[22:15] because for them it's a wonderful way
[22:18] actually to place their government bonds
[22:21] and uh actually and to to to let the
[22:24] system run and that's being designed
[22:26] like that. Uh so I think that's
[22:28] something where I can see even in the
[22:30] future massive blow up risk coming from
[22:33] that. We have seen it by the way in
[22:34] Europe already in Europe uh in Austria
[22:37] uh 2011 Creek government bonds zero risk
[22:41] waiting and we lost our shots like banks
[22:44] and insurance companies mainly. So I
[22:47] think how the and here again there's
[22:49] this belief you have complicated models
[22:51] and people talk about bitcoin like oh
[22:53] it's complicated it's very tough
[22:55] technology like bitcoin is actually very
[22:58] easy it's like code is is like I haven't
[23:00] read a code but it's not that long uh I
[23:03] know the key
[23:04] elements compare that to a financial
[23:07] institution like a bank where you have a
[23:09] central banks behind and you have this
[23:11] like complex models which by the way
[23:14] being a math guy and understand some of
[23:16] these models you can arbitrage them um
[23:20] like crazy uh that that I wouldn't even
[23:24] believe um I think that's that's really
[23:26] a danger because suddenly you have
[23:28] people getting involved as you said
[23:30] Robin with
[23:31] PhDs smart being paid so much money they
[23:35] know exactly what's going on I tell you
[23:37] these people have no freaking idea they
[23:40] are really you always should trust a
[23:43] hardcore simple Wall street commodity
[23:46] trader with a beer belly talking rough
[23:50] these guys you can trust these people
[23:52] with PhDs will happen that I have one
[23:54] but usually I'm talking the big gains
[23:57] and model do not trust them
[24:00] good that I don't have a PhD well it's
[24:03] it's not necessary
[24:06] um I've it's so interesting are you
[24:09] familiar with with Larry Le's book the
[24:12] the big print basically like the name
[24:15] play with with with the big short um
[24:18] where he kind of says like oh there
[24:19] there will come a a huge print event
[24:22] which will be maybe similar to what the
[24:24] big short is coming. Do you think that
[24:27] this is is something that anyways comes
[24:29] when when the system is going and not
[24:31] even if someone high up is is going in a
[24:34] really good direction and he has the
[24:36] best intentions can reverse that.
[24:39] Um I I don't know the book but I know of
[24:42] of him and I heard the maybe I should
[24:45] really read the book. Uh yes I think I
[24:49] think big print uh I I would say falling
[24:52] and I've seen it in subprime uh market
[24:56] risk or I would say blowups usually they
[24:59] always happen. It's like just pul
[25:02] financial history but they always happen
[25:05] in a way none of us expect. That's one
[25:08] thing. It's like you think it happens
[25:10] that and actually happens in the other
[25:11] direction. Subprime. Nobody expected
[25:14] that market could be a problem for the
[25:17] overall uh financial market because it
[25:20] was not a big market but it sort of like
[25:24] proon trust to zero. People didn't trust
[25:27] institutions. People didn't trust each
[25:29] other anymore. So do I think the big
[25:31] print could like uh money printing I
[25:34] would assume is is a big issue.
[25:35] Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh I I I looked
[25:40] lately uh and I'm not an economist by
[25:42] any means. I'm more like a gut feeling
[25:45] guy who sort of like applies when I said
[25:48] models don't trust model trust simple
[25:50] models. That's important. simple models
[25:52] and I say something to that how we
[25:55] spotted the Dutch bank uh and how we
[25:58] traded we use simple common sensical
[26:01] models easy to understand and say ah
[26:04] actually yeah that's that's sort of like
[26:06] should be the outcome and not
[26:07] complicated
[26:09] uh uh highly sophisticated quant
[26:12] mechanical models were like okay
[26:15] uh nobody really knows what's going on
[26:18] only this one guy and he fell sick then
[26:20] we we are in trouble So I don't believe
[26:22] in that. So I think I think when it
[26:25] comes to the the money print um between
[26:28] I think the early 70s since the United
[26:30] States went off gold standard 71
[26:34] uh I think the money supply increased
[26:36] roughly by six six and a half% per year.
[26:39] That's actually an interesting point
[26:41] because that doesn't sound very very
[26:44] high one six six and a half% a year but
[26:48] what now kicks on in and human beings
[26:50] are really bad at that we are very bad
[26:52] at expon to to
[26:54] to assess exponential
[26:57] growth since then I think we started
[27:01] with 400 million back then 400 billion
[27:05] of money supply M2 we ended up today had
[27:09] like around 22 billion in the United
[27:11] States. So roughly if the number is
[27:13] right that was even at 300 billion in
[27:16] 1971 I checked I think yesterday
[27:18] something like that and today is like
[27:20] running at 36 trillion running more like
[27:23] at 7 7 half 7 to 8% annual growth that's
[27:27] like where compounding kicks in and I
[27:29] think that's an interesting point what
[27:31] uh I think it comes to that one when I
[27:33] spend more time in New York I moved into
[27:36] you ultimately in 09 but in ' 05 when
[27:40] you go when you drive through Midtown in
[27:42] New York, there's this like a national
[27:44] debt watch, the that tower debt watch. I
[27:49] was always impressed by this like where
[27:50] you see the national debt of the United
[27:52] States. And I remember in 2005 it was
[27:55] around 7 half 8
[27:58] trillion. And then when I moved over
[28:00] there in 2009 10, I like woo this thing
[28:03] just flipped to 10 trillion. And you see
[28:06] like the numbers how they go up like
[28:08] like this is crazy. like really is like
[28:11] this is like so much money has been
[28:13] being being like so much debt is being
[28:15] created any second and just lately I was
[28:18] in the beginning of the year um couple
[28:21] months ago and again I think it's now at
[28:24] like 36
[28:26] trillion and and you're like just like
[28:29] wow within 20 years it went from
[28:32] something which is like five 78 trillion
[28:35] to like 36 trillion now do the math for
[28:37] one moment I like to have very simple
[28:40] math like that's nothing when you're on
[28:42] Wall Street you're being trained to have
[28:43] very simple rules. Uh so you double if
[28:47] you if you invest your money and you uh
[28:50] you have an interest rate of of let's
[28:52] say uh uh of like let's say say 10 and
[28:56] so then you know the rule of 72. So you
[28:59] double the money always in terms of
[29:02] number of years which is equal to 72
[29:04] divided by the interest rate. So at an
[29:07] interest rate of 10% you will double the
[29:09] money roughly every seven year 7 72
[29:13] divided by 10. Now the debt increases
[29:16] roughly by 78% every year which means 72
[29:22] divided by 7. So around every 10 year
[29:25] you see a doubling of debt actually what
[29:27] we've seen which means in 20 years we
[29:30] have two doubles which means four times
[29:32] the death of today if nothing changes
[29:35] above more than well above 100
[29:39] trillion now you pay interest on that
[29:42] four five trillion every year this is
[29:45] like a huge part of your GDP which
[29:48] doesn't which grows with like one and a
[29:49] half 2% so ultimately you run in deep
[29:51] deep trouble and I think that's what you
[29:53] right now under Trump, do um Latnik,
[29:58] they
[29:59] realize the exponential growth now
[30:02] finally kicks in and that's not
[30:05] sustainable and not even for a nation
[30:07] like the United States. Is there where
[30:10] the strategic Bitcoin reserve comes in
[30:12] or are they just looking at it as like,
[30:14] oh, we we buy it now because the voters
[30:17] like made you made us buy it?
[30:21] Well, I don't I don't know how much is
[30:24] real in that one. whether they believe
[30:27] and and I've I've seen the math and
[30:29] analysis from different people saying
[30:31] they should own 1 million of bitcoins
[30:33] and then it's like in US you know when
[30:36] you do I think baseball like they have
[30:39] this concept like hail mary you just
[30:41] throw like at the end like you're about
[30:43] to lose just throw the ball like into
[30:45] the cro and something maybe happen and
[30:47] maybe you're lucky and you you win very
[30:50] likely you out maybe it's a hail mary
[30:52] for them to say we do it that way uh Um,
[30:56] it's not it's it's
[30:58] it's not actually I I I'm I'm I'm not
[31:01] sure how serious they are. I think they
[31:04] make all the right right noises. I think
[31:06] they look at it seriously. They
[31:08] understand this. I I think what they
[31:11] realize I would
[31:13] say I I I I would maybe take the Bitcoin
[31:17] reserve of the United States when Trump
[31:20] talks about that as literally as people
[31:23] think it is. I think that's often what
[31:25] happens uh especially in Europe is oh
[31:27] but he said exactly that so fact check
[31:30] so he said that so this is going to
[31:31] happen oh he doesn't do it he's a liar
[31:34] no I think what's happening here is he
[31:37] takes it as like a a bit of a test
[31:39] balloon a bit of an idea generation for
[31:42] him it's pretty much saying what we have
[31:44] currently is broken it's we cannot run
[31:47] it for for many years left so we have to
[31:50] do something so he comes up with like
[31:52] the opposite side which Bitcoin reserve
[31:54] which is Bitcoin I would say more of
[31:56] like from like it's it's it's it's it's
[31:59] it's you cannot really take him as I say
[32:02] literally but you should take him
[32:04] absolutely seriously huge respect now uh
[32:07] I think now 80% of your of your uh
[32:11] clients of your viewers going to puke
[32:13] and say about this like I think he's an
[32:16] interesting guy he has he has the
[32:18] ability to open up new horizons and new
[32:20] and he does it in his very unique way
[32:22] with language
[32:23] And here it's the same thing to say
[32:25] let's talk about Bitcoin uh strategic
[32:28] reserves as the opening up the mindset
[32:31] to say the system we have currently in
[32:34] place it's very likely going to fail
[32:37] let's open a bit our
[32:40] uh the way we looked at at our financial
[32:42] system. I actually think there are uh a
[32:45] lot of Trump uh supporters in in in the
[32:48] Bitcoin community. I actually think the
[32:50] uh I mean one uh clear proof of that is
[32:54] how much money uh David Bailey and the
[32:57] Bitcoin magazine through Bitcoin has
[33:00] raised for Trump. I I've I've heard the
[33:02] uh metric right. It was just like so so
[33:05] big. I don't know I cannot remember it
[33:07] but it was a huge amount of money that
[33:09] Bitcoin has kind of raised uh for him.
[33:11] So that like that's it's a clear
[33:13] indication that Bitcoiners are um at
[33:16] least in front of before the election
[33:19] behind him after that with with the
[33:22] cornery I heard more and more critical
[33:25] voices uh and but there also on the
[33:28] other side there was the campaign of
[33:31] what was it called Bitcoiners for Harris
[33:34] or something like that. So there
[33:35] Democrats uh that that supported Harris.
[33:37] So it it was I think from the numbers a
[33:40] lot smaller uh but it's it's uh an an
[33:44] existing group also like that's where we
[33:46] come back bitcoin is non-political it's
[33:48] it's it's something that is uh neutral
[33:51] and on both uh both both sides but I
[33:54] would say it has a tendency for
[33:55] republicans and and Trump and and less
[33:58] so on the Democrat side at least what I
[34:00] see absolutely I think I think the
[34:03] Republicans in the United States stand a
[34:05] bit more like what especially Trump, not
[34:08] not not everybody, but I think they
[34:12] still have they carry the ideas of the
[34:14] founding fathers of like liberty,
[34:16] happiness, freedom, uh that type of
[34:19] idea. And I take that very seriously
[34:21] some of them. Um and uh it's interesting
[34:24] you got if I'm remembering correctly you
[34:26] got actually a bipartisan uh uh
[34:29] resolution around the central banking
[34:31] digital currency where actually both
[34:33] sides this stuff is not going to happen
[34:35] here which tells you the idea of like
[34:38] liberty even works across both both
[34:41] parties to say whereby Europeans are oh
[34:44] that's a good thing it looks very
[34:45] efficient to us and like I don't know
[34:47] what's wrong with you guys it's like
[34:49] this is like very uh this is like uh
[34:52] this reminds me of Soviet Union type of
[34:54] st and this is like I'm a German by
[34:57] background but I don't live in Germany
[34:58] for the
[35:00] last oh gosh I'm already old more than
[35:03] 25 years quarter of a century more
[35:05] almost more than my half my life I lived
[35:08] outside Germany uh so but I can see from
[35:11] outside um that that there is
[35:14] unbelievable that we just came out in
[35:17] Germany East Germany I'm west German of
[35:20] like the social democ democratic system
[35:22] which never worked total control and we
[35:25] actually we are willing again to trade
[35:28] into total control and say okay makes
[35:31] again for what you said Robin oh these
[35:33] guys they know they are so smart I can
[35:35] talk so well I'm just a simple man what
[35:38] do I understand and let's put my money
[35:41] on the spaboo not and then it's another
[35:44] crazy thing when I took my friends in
[35:46] Germany I say why do you put the
[35:47] freaking money on the even let's invest
[35:50] in equity That's a good way good way to
[35:52] start say oh that's risky like but you
[35:55] know this thing is worth for sure 100%
[35:59] probability much less in 5 years from
[36:02] now than
[36:03] today they don't comprehend that and I
[36:06] think that's that's that's that's uh
[36:07] that's the very evil thing and Americans
[36:10] are a bit more open and more creative
[36:12] and I think that comes to the idea what
[36:14] you said earlier Bitcoin reserve it's
[36:16] more what you have in the United States
[36:18] which I've been missing in Europe this
[36:20] massive amount of creativity constantly
[36:22] and and willingness to challenge old
[36:26] ideas and and I love that for for the
[36:30] Americans is basically a savings vehicle
[36:32] that I'm trying to get everyone out
[36:36] of you you lock your money up for like
[36:40] four or five years and you get 1%
[36:41] interest or something lovable small. Uh
[36:44] so I I don't know like I cannot get a
[36:47] there's not not a single reason why I
[36:48] would do that.
[36:50] Absolutely. And I think I think uh it's
[36:52] it's it's but but I think Bitcoin
[36:55] is can be on a bigger theme. I think can
[36:59] be a big sol it's a big solution for
[37:01] everyone. I think that's the most
[37:03] dominant view for me is like and I tend
[37:06] to write like little tweets on that to
[37:08] say everyone can be his own bank. This
[37:12] is a revolutionary idea like like the
[37:15] idea that I can wire Bitcoin right now
[37:18] from here sitting in London or to you
[37:21] sitting in in Vienna and uh we don't
[37:25] need a bank and we can see it what's
[37:27] going through we can go to Meool we know
[37:30] exactly transaction and we can do it
[37:32] even on like Saturday night and and then
[37:35] and and and and I think the idea has is
[37:40] so like not well understood. yet to what
[37:42] actually everybody can be his own bank.
[37:46] You're not forced to trade for something
[37:49] bad because you know my the people from
[37:51] Argentina understand it very well. if I
[37:53] get my uh my pesos now um um it's like
[37:57] it's like worth like 25 less person half
[38:02] next week and
[38:03] nowation came down a lot thanks to mele
[38:07] um uh and and I think they understand to
[38:10] just buy anything any crap and I think
[38:13] uh to have to have sort of like time to
[38:16] say I don't have to do anything I don't
[38:17] have a good idea and I really want to
[38:20] see what's going on and if I think ah
[38:22] That's a good one. I really want to have
[38:25] that then. Yes. Then I really use that.
[38:27] So Bitcoin Bitcoin I think has has has
[38:30] some wonderful features and I can see
[38:32] ultimately far far down the line and I'm
[38:36] way too old Robin way too old that I
[38:39] going to experience that that uh it's
[38:41] not going to be just like the huddle
[38:44] characteristics which people love. I
[38:46] think it's going to be the the medium
[38:48] exchange like your Austrian K Manga
[38:51] Austrian school of economics talked
[38:53] about that a lot what is money currency
[38:56] and ultimately as a unit of count to
[38:58] where people measure actually uh
[39:01] actually uh stuff in in in bitcoin and
[39:04] think about in bitcoin they say wow uh
[39:06] in 2015 when bitcoin was let's say at
[39:11] 400 500 800 to buy a house I needed like
[39:16] let's say one 100 three 400 bitcoins and
[39:21] now I need like four. It's like no uh
[39:25] that's that's that's like I think people
[39:28] that's an idea to bring home and uh when
[39:31] I took to friends uh I sort of like do
[39:33] it very I do it like very little like
[39:36] talk to friends and families and I get
[39:38] so like no that's interesting in the in
[39:40] the beginning they say you think that's
[39:42] crazy Bitcoin what's that it's a scheme
[39:44] it's scam and all that uh but coming
[39:47] from the banking side I carry and I know
[39:50] it gives me some in in the wrong way
[39:53] credibility
[39:54] U because people say, "Oh, what do you
[39:56] think about stock market?" I'm not I'm
[39:58] not able to look
[39:59] around. Um but um but when it comes to
[40:02] Bitcoin, I think I can say I think it's
[40:05] it's it's it's a very wise decision if
[40:08] you really want to become independent,
[40:10] wealthy, and free from any
[40:13] government. It's it's somehow it's it's
[40:16] it it sort of like works beautifully.
[40:20] Do you think when we come back to the
[40:22] the big short and what's maybe comes a
[40:25] second time, do you think Bitcoin is now
[40:27] the best bet against the system falling
[40:30] down? Absolutely. It's it's interesting
[40:33] anyway like when Bitcoin started um I
[40:36] think the white paper was written if I'm
[40:38] not mistaken around like October
[40:40] something September October 2008
[40:43] uh that was the time September uh 2008
[40:46] Leman Brothers went on I used to work at
[40:50] Leman Brothers was the day until 2004 so
[40:54] I was not around then at this place and
[40:58] uh the we've seen actually the low of
[41:00] the of the stock market in the S&P 500
[41:03] in I think March
[41:04] 2009 and just around that time the first
[41:08] block the Genesis block was mined I
[41:11] think January 3rd
[41:12] 2009 so it's it's really strange and
[41:17] it's co it's a really weird coincidence
[41:19] and not in conspiracy that just around
[41:22] that
[41:23] time so like a very it looks like a very
[41:27] difficult cryptographic questions double
[41:29] spending was solved
[41:31] I think by one guy. I don't think
[41:33] there's too many people. Uh I wouldn't
[41:35] keep the secret for too long. And so
[41:38] like given to us and my statement is the
[41:42] following. If the financial system would
[41:45] have been fixed in
[41:48] 2009, if you had not bailed out any of
[41:50] these banks, if this whole thing just
[41:52] would have had a big reset and the
[41:54] bankers who created the mess, I can tell
[41:57] you I know guys who lost hundreds of
[42:00] millions up to billions and you think
[42:03] they're never going to find a job
[42:04] anymore. No, no, no. They actually not
[42:07] only rose in the hierarchies, they even
[42:10] became very rich on a way.
[42:13] This is crazy. And that's where I
[42:14] realized this has nothing to do with
[42:16] Wall Street. That has nothing to do with
[42:18] capitalism. Actually, this is nothing
[42:20] else than nepism. It's the difference.
[42:22] It's like you're my buddy. Let's hammer
[42:24] something out. And we use other people's
[42:27] investors or government money to enrich
[42:29] ourself. That's the system we are
[42:31] talking about here. And I was back then
[42:35] and so I'm today highly disgusted by
[42:37] that. Highly disgusted. So I think I
[42:40] think Bitcoin if the system had would
[42:42] have had a total reset which it didn't
[42:44] today nobody would talk about Bitcoin it
[42:46] would be literally at 0.00
[42:48] you some like well nothing. I think
[42:52] Bitcoin reflects the price of Bitcoin
[42:56] reflects the anxiety of society around
[43:00] the current financial system and the
[43:02] higher the prices the more anxiety is
[43:04] actually there to say is the system
[43:06] going to break down that's so like and
[43:08] that's by the way has been my view for
[43:09] many many years. Uh it's actually it's
[43:12] like almost like a fever therm
[43:14] thermometer uh uh in terms of like uh
[43:17] stability of the system and trust in the
[43:19] system and with the rising bitcoin price
[43:22] this going to go down. Therefore nobody
[43:25] trusts the system anymore and therefore
[43:26] you can see central bankers I have a
[43:29] good friend of mine who works at the fed
[43:31] he hates bitcoins uh the easy they just
[43:34] hate it because they cannot really
[43:36] defeat it anymore. And I I love it. I
[43:38] love it. Let's take a break for a moment
[43:40] and appreciate the beauty that coin
[43:43] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[43:46] watches. Those watches are the most
[43:48] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[43:51] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner
[43:54] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[43:56] completely new and amazing Genesis
[43:59] edition of their watch collections. You
[44:02] have the date of the first ever mined
[44:05] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[44:07] also the block height and which epoch we
[44:10] are currently in. I love the level of
[44:13] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[44:16] Make sure to check out those amazing
[44:18] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[44:21] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[44:24] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[44:27] really do hope that you don't have it on
[44:29] exchange. But if you do have it on
[44:31] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[44:33] deal with that. The first way is you put
[44:35] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[44:37] entry for you to get into the
[44:40] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[44:43] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[44:46] super simple and secure way. And if you
[44:49] check out the link in the description,
[44:51] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[44:54] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[44:57] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[45:00] partner in terms of how to get the most
[45:03] out of your sovereignty. They will
[45:05] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[45:08] that is perfect for your individual
[45:11] situation. They will show you how you
[45:14] can secure your own devices. Securing
[45:16] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[45:18] have to keep all your devices secure.
[45:21] One topic that is overlooked often is
[45:23] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[45:26] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[45:29] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[45:31] place already? And last but not least,
[45:33] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[45:35] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[45:38] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[45:43] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[45:46] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[45:48] be for the first time ever speaking at
[45:51] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[45:54] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[45:56] really looking forward to seeing all of
[45:58] you there. You can get your ticket in
[46:01] the link down in the description of
[46:03] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[46:05] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[46:09] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[46:11] there. I I love that uh description of
[46:14] the Bitcoin price being a signal or a
[46:17] sign for how bad the fiat system is is
[46:21] is doing that kind of fever uh thing.
[46:24] It's really cool. How as someone that
[46:27] looks at math, you probably also look at
[46:29] all those stock to flow um power law and
[46:32] and price models. Is there something uh
[46:35] to that uh or is that just a descriptive
[46:38] way of describing the past price
[46:40] performance? Well, I I came across the
[46:44] the the uh the parallel from
[46:47] Travani and um in the beginning I said
[46:51] you shouldn't trust models. I've seen
[46:53] that in in the banking world but it's
[46:56] different when I look towards Chavan's
[46:58] power law model. Um
[47:01] I I sort of like came across a tweet
[47:04] which he I think like one and a half
[47:06] years ago and something like that where
[47:08] he said Bitcoin price versus time
[47:13] uh is a scale invariant and immediately
[47:17] I got it like oh I understand what that
[47:18] means because I uh when I when I did
[47:22] math during my PhD times uh one of the
[47:26] subject I did was nonlinear dynamics.
[47:29] scale in RAM system fractile geometry um
[47:34] like interest very very very interesting
[47:37] subject
[47:39] and I said well that's that's let's
[47:40] that's let's that's let's let's check
[47:42] that and and and and and so I I I I I
[47:46] got the historical bitcoin prices I
[47:48] pretty much it's been done you can doing
[47:50] do that in like few minutes and run and
[47:53] you can do it and everybody can do that
[47:54] in Excel sheet a linear regression model
[47:57] on the lock of price and the lock of
[48:00] time and the time is from the beginning
[48:03] of the Bitcoin uh uh network like 2009
[48:06] January
[48:07] 2009 and then you see a straight line
[48:11] certain dumps but so like the
[48:13] statistical measure one of them is like
[48:15] our sphere is in the '9s very high I've
[48:18] never seen something like that and
[48:22] that's one thing you have a model but
[48:24] then as well to have the philosophical
[48:26] view why would that actually make sense?
[48:29] And because I did nonlinear math, you
[48:33] understand power law actually surrounds
[48:35] us everywhere. Uh when you have for
[48:39] example
[48:41] many individual
[48:43] actors doing their little thing, working
[48:46] against each other with each
[48:48] other, you actually the the collective
[48:52] has certain characteristic which none of
[48:54] the each individuals has. Another way to
[48:56] say it is is to complicate maybe you are
[49:00] much more than all your individual
[49:03] cells. You have thoughts, you have
[49:05] speech, you can do all these things.
[49:08] Bitcoin is much more than just the
[49:10] mining nodes and the miner and and and
[49:13] the
[49:14] investors. It's it's so like has this
[49:16] network effect. So more and more people
[49:18] coming in. So I think it fits very well
[49:21] to the power law scalefree model
[49:24] beautifully. And that's actually one
[49:26] which I gives me like as a thinking of
[49:30] Bitcoin the power law is a bit like a
[49:32] northstar for me which like sort of like
[49:35] this confidence to say well that gives
[49:39] me give me an idea where Bitcoin
[49:41] ultimately will should end up it's a bit
[49:44] it's so like similar when I do investing
[49:46] in stocks and you're investing in index
[49:50] S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100. So like you know
[49:53] on a daily basis a lot of things can
[49:55] happen but you know over a long history
[49:57] for example S&P 500 for the last 65
[50:00] years or so grows with 10%.
[50:04] that gives you s of like even and we had
[50:06] like we had we had number we had oil
[50:09] crisis we had.com we had financial we
[50:12] had everything and co it closed so like
[50:15] over a long period when you really zoom
[50:17] out and that's I think for bitcoin
[50:20] that's being provided by power law and
[50:22] the other models I don't really uh I
[50:24] think stock flow seems to be very
[50:26] complicated and adjustment so I power
[50:29] law is I think I like I like the a it
[50:32] seems to be working very well and say
[50:34] something as well from what I could
[50:37] test. Secondly, as well the simplicity
[50:40] it's a very simple thing to say price of
[50:42] Bitcoin is
[50:44] proportional to the time elapsed since
[50:47] the first Bitcoin was mined in 2009 to a
[50:50] power of
[50:51] 5.8 roughly. And here again it gives you
[50:55] a very simple idea uh to say what does
[50:58] it actually mean? Because people say
[51:00] well I I I hated math when I was young
[51:03] so I didn't really want to do that.
[51:04] Actually means in simple terms we are
[51:07] now in
[51:08] 2025 16 years since Bitcoin uh was
[51:12] created and the first block was mined.
[51:16] So when should we expect a 10 times
[51:19] higher price from now like we have
[51:21] variations around that. Well, if you
[51:24] apply this model, it says
[51:27] roughly 50% of time elapsed since then
[51:31] will take it will take until you see a
[51:34] 10 times of higher value. What does it
[51:36] mean? 16 years 50% of that is 8 years.
[51:39] So in 8 years, Bitcoin should be roughly
[51:42] at 1 million. It's very simple. It comes
[51:45] out of that. And again, it's scale in
[51:47] rank. When people say, "Wow, this is
[51:50] nonsense." Because they want to have
[51:52] Bitcoin going to one trillion tomorrow.
[51:55] It's like, I've seen that like, well,
[51:58] that's not going to happen if you have
[52:00] the power law. I think that's why he he
[52:02] has he gets a lot of people who don't
[52:04] like him, who actually dislike him. I
[52:06] don't get him. He's a character. I love
[52:09] his work. He's doing great. Fantastic
[52:10] work. Um, and as well his partner,
[52:14] what's his name? I think you had him on
[52:15] the show. Uh, Steve. Yeah, Stephen. Uh,
[52:18] I I don't know how to pronounce his last
[52:20] name or paranoid. Money or something
[52:22] like that. Yeah,
[52:24] money is his handle. I think I had three
[52:27] people on with the Paulo, Fred Krueger,
[52:29] Javanni, and and Steven Paranoid. And
[52:32] and and and I think I think great work
[52:34] what they're doing. Uh and and and I can
[52:36] really and for me as well, it's
[52:38] something where actually I I I and and I
[52:41] see that. And when people say, "Oh, it's
[52:43] going to go up to 1 million within like
[52:45] one year." Well, that wouldn't be a
[52:47] power law. And by the way, that's
[52:49] something you don't even want to have
[52:50] because that creates instability. I've
[52:53] seen it in the great financial crisis.
[52:55] Suddenly, demand for certain products
[52:57] subprime goes
[53:00] exponential. That looks cool for a while
[53:03] until things explode. So, power level
[53:06] gives a strength and ultimately as well
[53:08] you see because it's power law a
[53:11] diminishing return over time. So I think
[53:14] that's uh so I'm a big I'm a big fan of
[53:16] his work of Joan's work and yes I I I
[53:21] take that a bit as my my northstar and
[53:25] maybe it's going to blow up in my face
[53:26] and going to age like milk but I don't
[53:29] think so from what I've seen I don't
[53:32] think so and the last point to make here
[53:34] is u I think the model became very
[53:37] popular uh I think he already wrote
[53:39] about that many years ago but then as I
[53:42] think German American uh guy uh what's
[53:45] his name? Um Harold uh Harold uh
[53:50] forgotten his name. He made it public I
[53:52] think on one of the blogs where he sort
[53:54] of like took the idea uh and um and said
[53:58] well that's the power was 2019 September
[54:02] Bitcoin was back then at uh 2000 at
[54:06] around 8,000 78 9,000. So when you take
[54:10] exactly
[54:12] the parameters and you only have two
[54:15] parameters. The slope the it's like uh
[54:19] and you really have to take these
[54:21] parameters from there back then and
[54:23] calculate the price of today will come
[54:26] out at like now I think 100
[54:29] $110,000. So that's pretty cool and
[54:32] pretty close. We are like literally in
[54:34] the area and we move by a factor of 10
[54:38] over six years. Um, that's I think and I
[54:43] like that. I'm I'm I'm not a fan to say
[54:45] what's going to happen in the future. I
[54:47] in science as well and in banking as
[54:49] well. You're being trained about the
[54:52] result to say what is it what you said
[54:54] and what was the outcome and it's being
[54:57] measured. Banking and science same
[54:59] thing. Uh, and I love that about about
[55:02] trading and I love that about that one.
[55:03] It worked very very well when being
[55:06] tested. Really really cool. Yeah, that's
[55:09] why I'm saying uh
[55:11] Bitcoin. I I think my outcome results
[55:14] will be quite good in 10 years. But I I
[55:16] I like the way because I say that a lot
[55:21] and I don't hear that often enough. Um
[55:24] if if the Fiat system is the Titanic, uh
[55:27] and we want to get to to the safe land,
[55:30] we need the and and the Titanic is kind
[55:33] of slowly slowly sinking as the Fiat is
[55:35] is already sinking. We don't want that
[55:38] Titanic sinking in half an hour. We want
[55:40] that Titanic sinking over 24 48 hours as
[55:44] as slow as possible. So we have time to
[55:47] build out that uh boat of of of Bitcoin.
[55:50] So when someone is calling, oh like uh
[55:53] the Bitcoin price is going to a million
[55:55] 205 is going to 10 million 205 or there
[55:59] will be a point where just Bitcoin goes
[56:00] to infinity and all the feat collapses.
[56:03] I don't think that's something we should
[56:05] wish for. And I I think you mentioned it
[56:07] in the beginning where you have this
[56:08] high five moment, but then all of the
[56:11] sudden you're like, "Oh the whole
[56:12] thing collapses and everyone loses."
[56:14] Actually, yeah. It's is a great, by the
[56:17] way, I like I like the picture you you
[56:19] use here. It's a it's a great analogy.
[56:22] Absolutely. And
[56:23] uh because people think, "Oh, I won. I'm
[56:28] smarter." So, I'm I was never in a
[56:30] business of trying to look smarter
[56:33] because I'm not than the other guy. So
[56:35] clearly I want to have a happy and free
[56:37] life and I want to do things I want to
[56:39] do and I really dislike having anybody
[56:43] anybody telling me what I should be
[56:44] doing. And really at the very least I
[56:47] not a government not a government or
[56:50] anybody and actually I was not a perfect
[56:52] corporate guy either. So Wall Street
[56:53] worked very well for me the minute I was
[56:56] not a really good like up world match.
[56:59] uh so maybe I was a bit too too my
[57:01] language was uh too maybe a bit too
[57:04] plain and simple just want to say it
[57:06] like that uh for senior management so I
[57:09] think uh I think absolutely we we don't
[57:11] want to have that because what I said in
[57:14] the beginning you would create in my
[57:17] view a Mad Max scenario do you know the
[57:20] movie Mad Max I know it but I've never
[57:22] seen it actually that was one I watched
[57:24] I think four or five times I always like
[57:26] Tina Turner uh so like wonderful actor
[57:29] and wonderful artist. Uh she plays the
[57:32] main role, Mad Max. That's the world you
[57:35] don't want to live in. And when the
[57:37] great financial crisis happened, um I
[57:40] know a lot of my friends back then,
[57:43] family members um uh well got very very
[57:48] nervous when I came to like to to to
[57:50] Europe. They got really and I was very
[57:53] nervous during that time. I couldn't
[57:55] sleep. I worked around the clock
[57:57] constantly like what's happening all
[57:59] this like it it makes you very itchy and
[58:01] I remember back then that uh a friend of
[58:05] mine said I had a big house and huge
[58:07] garden it was in Austria somewhere I
[58:09] think yeah was in Austria huge garden
[58:12] beautiful said oh pe what do you think I
[58:15] should buy I should buy maybe some coal
[58:17] and we should buy food and whatever like
[58:19] no no if that happens what we think can
[58:22] happen what you need actually is a gun
[58:25] because people going to come over your
[58:27] fences. They're going to steal,
[58:30] exponential, rape, whatever they can do.
[58:32] It's going to be a very unpleasant
[58:34] situation and society can break down
[58:37] quickly because that's another thing
[58:38] people and that's what I've seen with
[58:40] the great financial crisis. When so when
[58:43] things break down that comes out of non
[58:46] dynamics what I did as well when things
[58:48] break down they break down quickly and
[58:52] there's no way you can fix that. like
[58:54] you just go down. Therefore, when people
[58:56] say that in the Bitcoin scene, I my my
[59:00] my my feedback to that is
[59:03] like you do not want to wish you do not
[59:06] want to have this scenario. That's a
[59:07] very dystopian scenario and then and and
[59:10] unfortunately we already getting with
[59:12] the European governments and regulation
[59:15] and central counts digital euro we are
[59:18] already entering a very dark dystopian
[59:21] world in my view which uh uh uh which so
[59:24] like irritates me highly but then you
[59:28] say oh I I was right no I think social
[59:31] is never really a good thing that's
[59:33] interesting um there's one aspect that
[59:36] comes uh I've you described today but
[59:40] also when we met in in in Swiss uh that
[59:42] you've traveled a lot of places and and
[59:45] your home is in in many different places
[59:48] so to say. Um if you had to now like
[59:51] pick one place especially if if let's
[59:53] say there there's actually something
[59:55] happening that you can reside to and you
[59:59] have to pick like one place to root your
[60:01] family in. disregarding your personal
[60:04] situation right now, disregarding any
[60:06] connections you have, where would you
[60:07] live and and why? Well, currently I'm
[60:11] I'm living effect in in in London. So,
[60:13] that's a place I know I've been here uh
[60:17] between 202. So, I know the place very
[60:20] well. By the way, dystopian as well.
[60:22] What's happening here? If you Well,
[60:25] choose a great question.
[60:28] Um I I I I think yeah everybody know
[60:32] talks about El Salador and and that type
[60:35] of things. I
[60:37] well my tail in my head like clearly I'm
[60:40] not really the South American middle
[60:41] American guy. Yeah. Uh so I would say
[60:46] Switzerland would be the natural choice
[60:48] because uh why why Switzerland has been
[60:51] around for many many
[60:53] uh centuries actually has been proven to
[60:57] be bit libertarian more on the way they
[60:59] do things not so much as well lately I
[61:02] think they have UBS is by Vald big and
[61:05] uh they I think that they are more
[61:09] regulated as well something I don't like
[61:11] I don't like any form of regulations uh
[61:14] especially in financial affairs. Um and
[61:17] I think that's that's sort of like uh is
[61:20] a good place uh to be now if it were
[61:23] easier likenstein even great and it
[61:26] happened that now people say oh is this
[61:28] guy in like some weird like locations it
[61:31] happened that even we speak English my
[61:34] accent I think gives it away. Uh I grew
[61:37] up in the Alammanian region unfortunate
[61:40] unfortunately wrong side on the German
[61:42] side. So, so it takes me uh literally 30
[61:46] 40 minutes to drive to Switzerland or to
[61:48] Likenstein where I grew up. So, I I I
[61:51] know the place uh I know the place and
[61:53] area very well. I think it's free. I
[61:55] think in Europe it's the best place. I
[61:58] think if people if people uh in the
[62:02] world even there I would say um it's
[62:05] it's it's it's it's you want to you want
[62:08] to you want to you should where you feel
[62:11] comfortable to stay now what I like my
[62:15] personal preference is of course the
[62:17] United States it's just a wonderful
[62:19] country uh very dynamic that's and who
[62:23] knows maybe you're going to end up there
[62:25] ultimately I lived there for many many
[62:27] Yes,
[62:29] I'd say they have the they have the
[62:32] means to protect themselves and they
[62:34] they seem to value liberty a lot which I
[62:39] I like about the USA because Switzerland
[62:42] also values liberty but it's a small
[62:46] country and USA and like something
[62:48] really bad happening they have the means
[62:51] to protect the citizens. That's a
[62:54] interesting point. Yeah, that's that's
[62:55] true. And this is like all I think
[62:58] that's like these two these two
[63:00] countries are similar. Not dissimilar. I
[63:02] would say Switzerland is very small
[63:04] version, but they're very fierceful and
[63:06] you're not going to attack them. They're
[63:08] going to go up in the mountains and know
[63:10] how to defend themselves. Uh they've
[63:12] been around for many many and they've
[63:14] been surrounded. They've been around for
[63:15] many many centuries and surrounded by a
[63:18] very often aggressive neighbors. France
[63:22] for a long time, Germany especially, uh,
[63:25] and they were able to stand up to that.
[63:27] Um, I think I think they didn't have to
[63:30] fight. So, I think that's a great one.
[63:32] But the United States, uh, I it's I
[63:36] think they're going to celebrate now uh,
[63:38] the foundation, the 250 years
[63:41] anniversary next year, 20 2026 going to
[63:44] be huge. I think trying to spend some
[63:47] time in the United States then.
[63:49] Absolutely. That's that's uh that is a
[63:52] country which is actually built on the
[63:54] foundation of people who want to escape
[63:57] a Europe which was very dystopian which
[64:00] are run by kings and by uh by a feudal
[64:03] system and say I don't want to have any
[64:06] of that. So they went to the United
[64:08] States. Um and that's that's great. And
[64:10] as I said in the beginning I'm I'm I'm a
[64:12] huge fan of of the country. I huge fan
[64:15] of the people I met there. Uh, the
[64:18] creativity is great. Um, and I've seen
[64:21] it on your show as well. You have a lot
[64:22] of like Americans that come out from
[64:24] like the weirdest places. Like, holy
[64:27] smoke, who is that possible? And one
[64:29] thing not to underestimate, uh, which I
[64:32] only learned in the United States to
[64:35] cherish, which is their free speech,
[64:38] which no, suddenly something we never
[64:40] thought very much about that in Europe,
[64:43] but now it means something. and in US is
[64:46] like clear defending of free speech and
[64:50] a man and and and the second amendment
[64:52] man is actually weapon as well. So you
[64:55] should be able to defend yourself. So I
[64:57] think that's that's that's a cornerstone
[64:59] of of this country which is which is
[65:01] fantastic which in a weird way even the
[65:03] second amendment you don't have it like
[65:05] that in Switzerland but you know they
[65:07] have the army and people have actually
[65:08] the weapon at home uh to say if
[65:11] something can happen so um so they get
[65:14] don't get they don't outsource freedom
[65:18] liberty or
[65:20] defense to a third party
[65:23] uh Germany and France maybe less over
[65:27] Germany and other European countries.
[65:29] People seem they don't really mind which
[65:31] is which is crazy. I don't understand
[65:34] that. But
[65:36] and just one German out of 80 million.
[65:40] That's true. Um one last thing I want to
[65:43] get to is uh also with your background
[65:45] with Kander Fitzgerald. Um we probably
[65:48] heard the news of 21st Capital and then
[65:50] Czech Masers um kind of the first
[65:53] competition. I mean there's many
[65:55] competitions to
[65:56] strategy previously micro strategy. How
[65:59] do you look at uh the all of a sudden a
[66:02] lot of institutional investors and a lot
[66:05] of companies are slowly coming in. I
[66:07] mean a lot is maybe if you see all the
[66:09] companies a little bit overstated but
[66:11] there is slowly slowly movement coming.
[66:14] Well uh it's a great question. Uh
[66:17] there's one side where you actually
[66:19] think is it is it great that you have
[66:22] uh 21 capital or the biggest one is of
[66:26] course micro sailors uh you had on the
[66:28] show here uh uh uh micro strategy who is
[66:33] like now 550,000 bitcoins and growing
[66:37] every day stacking every day it doesn't
[66:39] make sense because almost feels like now
[66:41] you have like bitcoin in the hand of you
[66:44] where it was the idea of like to have a
[66:47] disman so I was like critical but then
[66:50] my overarching principle my life is I
[66:52] have a really libertarian way to think
[66:54] and to act and I'm believe in like if
[66:58] you if if you believe in the libertarian
[67:00] ideas then you should really follow
[67:02] through as well accordingly so not to
[67:04] say oh I don't like that but we're going
[67:06] to have that so like things ultimately
[67:08] going to shake out so if that's where
[67:10] the bitcoin movement is going that's few
[67:12] guys huddle a lot so that's what it is
[67:15] and is can it break the Bitcoin system?
[67:18] I don't think so. So, what do I think of
[67:20] of the idea? I think it's a it's a good
[67:22] one. Uh, absolutely. Um, because
[67:25] effectly what you're doing and they
[67:28] haven't really done it in a in a perfect
[67:30] way. Michael Z hasn't done it in a in a
[67:32] great way. is is is doing a great job by
[67:36] selling uh selling selling shares at
[67:39] more than two times his NIV which is
[67:42] effectively how he gets a bitcoin yield
[67:44] or increases the number of bitcoin per
[67:47] share that's a that's a good way but the
[67:51] ultimate I think goal has to be to go
[67:54] into the real debt market because the he
[67:57] plays mainly the equity market and the
[67:59] convert bond market but the convert bond
[68:01] market is a tiny market. I think the new
[68:04] issuance of conal bonds is like in the
[68:07] United States 70 80 million per year. So
[68:10] it's not very much. Currently the
[68:12] biggest issuer of conalles is a sailor.
[68:16] Um and secondly uh it's a bit of a can
[68:18] be a risky strategy as well because by
[68:21] issuing converted
[68:23] bonds the buyer of the converted bonds
[68:26] are not bitcoiners. They don't care
[68:28] about bitcoiners. There are Wall Street
[68:30] guys who do what they call the they call
[68:33] the conver arbitrage desk that take it
[68:36] on that buy the bond and I short the
[68:40] stock and the volatility helps them to
[68:43] capture some value that's in a nutshell.
[68:45] So pretty much a mic sale is effectively
[68:47] selling volatility to buy Bitcoin. But
[68:51] the goal but is it's a tiny market. The
[68:54] debt market is more like 300 trillion.
[68:57] That's where I grew up. I'm a debt
[69:00] trader. Uh and uh a lot of these debts
[69:04] is rated by rating agencies. So if and
[69:08] that I think will happen I I hope sooner
[69:11] or later if people come around and say
[69:14] listen I going to create debt structured
[69:18] debt bitcoin back debt which is rated
[69:21] and placed that in the market then
[69:24] suddenly I think we talk about different
[69:26] different scale and uh I think capital
[69:29] markets activity um and that's I think
[69:32] is the real price I haven't seen that
[69:34] yet from any any of the actors are still
[69:37] on the equity portion. Um, but I can see
[69:40] uh bitcoin uh backed bonds uh can get
[69:44] rated or where you just sell actually
[69:46] paper money and you buy bitcoin. Uh
[69:49] because what effect you're doing is that
[69:52] you're selling fiat money to buy Bitcoin
[69:56] or as my old boss Craig Lipman from Big
[70:00] Short used to say, buy quality and short
[70:04]  Uh so so I think I so I think you
[70:09] guys can figure out which one is which
[70:11] here in this example. Uh so I think I
[70:16] think I don't want to burn people here
[70:18] but uh some people just just just need
[70:21] sort of like paper money that's the
[70:23] regulation and I think if you really get
[70:26] a rating on it there's a lot of
[70:27] insurance buckets a lot of people who
[70:30] need a rating structured correctly then
[70:33] I think what the work which is done by
[70:35] by the by by by Jack Mer and that the
[70:37] work is being done by uh by Michael Sail
[70:40] is is a great one and I sort of like em
[70:44] embrace that. Uh but it can be risky as
[70:47] well. If things move around a lot,
[70:49] suddenly the guys who own your stock
[70:52] start selling your stock. And I've seen
[70:54] that because there's too much of the
[70:56] same risk in the market for traders. And
[70:59] that's something uh uh you want to be
[71:02] mindful. So you have to be able to issue
[71:05] different instruments. And I think the
[71:06] debt instruments are the best
[71:08] instruments because it gives you
[71:10] stability as well. So I don't know
[71:12] whether Michael Za or Czechm is working
[71:14] on these type of ideas. Uh but uh I hope
[71:18] they do and that's my background. My job
[71:21] was to work with waiting agencies and to
[71:23] trade all type of securities. A lot of
[71:26] them should have never gotten a rating
[71:28] but hey uh so thanks but definitely back
[71:33] then. So yes I think this comp uh these
[71:36] companies I watched them closely. I um
[71:40] uh I think that's a better way to take
[71:43] on leverage because just yesterday uh
[71:45] Robin I took a look as I think from um
[71:49] Powershares is a company it's an ETF
[71:51] provider in the United States where you
[71:53] have like double leverage on Bitcoin
[71:56] this is this is actually not great you
[71:58] know the daily balancing and just not
[72:00] doing a good thing here and when you
[72:02] compare it to Micro Strategy and I think
[72:05] I think Czech Mulligan be as successful
[72:07] ful you suddenly see actually does very
[72:11] very well and what I like about micro
[72:13] strategy is he's seen already like the
[72:15] massive bare market where he was trading
[72:17] actually below one he's multiple of Nav
[72:20] was below one and now it's above two so
[72:24] he's been already bit tested time tested
[72:27] I like that so I think if you want to
[72:29] take a leverage fume then that's a good
[72:32] way as I said yesterday in a tweet I
[72:34] would really sum it up like that if you
[72:36] look on 20 year horizon and you want to
[72:38] become wealthy and free. No. And you
[72:41] have let's say 5,000 euro. It should be
[72:44] should not be a financial advice. Don't
[72:46] take a financial advice from a former
[72:48] investment banker. But if you invest in
[72:51] gold and if it does what it used to,
[72:54] you're going to end up with six times
[72:56] money. 30,000. Let's take 10,000
[72:59] starting 60,000. If you invest in the
[73:02] S&P and uh and and and um and and Triple
[73:06] Q like the the NASDAQ 100, you're very
[73:09] likely going to make 10 times the money.
[73:10] You're going to be at 100,000 in 20
[73:12] years. Not bad. But yeah, if you invest
[73:15] in Bitcoin and it does what Bitcoin,
[73:18] what the power law says it should be
[73:19] doing, then you end up at 1 million, 100
[73:23] times the money. Now, suddenly in 20
[73:25] years, you're 25 years and 45 you're
[73:29] free. you have like the FU money
[73:32] potentially already and if you invest in
[73:36] leverage structure potentially micro
[73:38] structure I think it can be a much
[73:39] higher number. I love the the way of
[73:42] because uh in previous cycles we always
[73:44] saw the bitcoiners that want to get more
[73:47] bitcoin went to the
[73:49] altcoin way of of of kind of getting a
[73:51] higher performer and I actually see the
[73:54] performance and the dominance of bitcoin
[73:56] is growing uh especially against
[73:58] ethereum but also against all other
[74:00] altcoins and I I feel like one of the
[74:03] reasons is people can also now just buy
[74:05] micro strategy or now strategy B to
[74:08] outperform Bitcoin and It's a uh it's an
[74:11] established company like you're betting
[74:14] on a company that is around for what 15
[74:17] 20 no like l long longer than that. They
[74:19] were around it was found in 1997.
[74:23] Yeah. And it's like almost 30 years now,
[74:25] right? So that's it's a it's a long one.
[74:28] And way when you go in altcoin you
[74:30] there's no value on the lying and and
[74:33] and you're betting on a project that
[74:34] might be around for like a year uh and
[74:37] is probably gone in then a year again.
[74:39] So uh I I like the way of of of when you
[74:42] want to outperform Bitcoin having micro
[74:45] strategy even though I personally just
[74:47] have like 100% in Bitcoin. I don't deal
[74:49] with anything else uh and try to try to
[74:52] have my send moment there. I think
[74:54] that's and that's a wise I think that's
[74:56] very wise thing. you're young enough and
[74:58] uh and uh my view is if if Bitcoin for
[75:02] whatever reason ends up worth
[75:06] nothing then you're going you're exactly
[75:08] in the same situation as the other
[75:11] 99.999% of the people but if it's doing
[75:15] what you and I think it's going to do
[75:17] then well that's that's a great outcome
[75:21] exact this was my thinking was like if I
[75:24] end up with nothing in let's say 5 years
[75:26] when I'm 30. Yeah, I have the same thing
[75:28] that most people have. Nothing.
[75:32] Which changes a bit when you're like my
[75:35] age and way above your age. Then well,
[75:38] would I say just put 100% in Bitcoin?
[75:41] That would be a bit reckless. Uh but
[75:44] here again, you can say well if you
[75:46] really think of your cats and so on, a
[75:49] bigger portion of your private world
[75:50] should be should be uh should be part of
[75:53] that. So it's it really I think
[75:56] important as well is time horizon uh on
[75:59] on on stuff. So and I think the Bitcoin
[76:02] society I think I'm more on the very old
[76:05] side. So I think it's between like 25 to
[76:08] like 35. Uh and that's a very good age.
[76:11] Uh and to say absolutely uh that's
[76:13] that's and and and we will see we will
[76:16] see uh I'm convinced we we it's going to
[76:20] work out very well for for for bitcoins.
[76:23] I want to show you something because I
[76:24] see a lot this this misconception that
[76:26] Bitcoiners are young people. I want to
[76:30] show you that maybe maybe you like to
[76:33] see that the statistics. So let me Is it
[76:36] now the right screen? Yeah. Uh I mean
[76:39] that's just the last 28 days but that's
[76:41] the data that I'm always seeing. Uh I
[76:43] actually see uh over 6% of my viewers
[76:47] and like this is a host that is 25 years
[76:51] old. uh the over uh 6% of my view is
[76:55] actually above 65 and the majority is
[76:58] around those 35 years to uh 45 years old
[77:03] and I talked with exchanges and they
[77:05] also see the say the uh see the same
[77:07] thing the uh retail market is around
[77:10] like 40 42 years old on an average which
[77:15] is really fascinating. The first time I
[77:17] went to a Bitcoin meetup, um I went
[77:20] there and I expected a lot of young
[77:22] guys, but I was the only one I think
[77:25] under 30 years old there. Uh and uh that
[77:29] that's kind of that that shocked me when
[77:31] I went I was already all in Bitcoin, but
[77:33] I never um was in the Bitcoin community
[77:37] like with with either data with YouTube
[77:40] or with um being in in in meetups or
[77:43] something like that. But then I went
[77:45] there uh and and so like oh like the the
[77:49] Bitcoin community is actually um older
[77:51] than I thought. It's like mid- like 30
[77:54] 35 like you're not old. Uh but but uh uh
[77:59] for for me I just thought there's a lot
[78:01] of younger younger people there. Is is
[78:03] that is that uh um surprising for you?
[78:06] Well, that's actually yes and no. I
[78:09] think one thing and that's more a
[78:10] question to you Robin is like why is it
[78:13] that young people like I see uh 18 to 24
[78:16] seem to be not in like maybe they have
[78:18] other things to do and they don't care
[78:19] about financial affairs but that's when
[78:21] you start out working so now you've
[78:24] received money uh I don't know why that
[78:26] that I'm surprised by I'm not really
[78:28] surprised by the 35 to 44 the older
[78:31] folks I'm a bit surprised that they're
[78:33] really still in Bitcoin by the way and
[78:37] when you talk about investment bankers.
[78:39] I tell you there would be hardly any
[78:40] investment banker because they're just
[78:42] they just uh don't understand money and
[78:44] I didn't understand money. I only
[78:46] understood money when I got involved
[78:48] actually in Bitcoin. So I I'm a bit
[78:50] surprised by by that the young people.
[78:52] Why is that that the young guys are not
[78:55] really interested in Bitcoin? You talk
[78:57] to young guys. Is it like it's your folk
[78:59] folks? Yeah, it's it's it's super
[79:01] interesting and I I thought about it
[79:02] that a lot. Um the first thing is the
[79:06] the the Bitcoiners don't make the
[79:10] content that because younger let's say
[79:12] under 20 years old so like like between
[79:16] 15 to 20 maybe under 15 uh they're
[79:19] spending a lot of time on platforms like
[79:21] Tik Tok and Instagram and when you see
[79:24] where Bitcoin content is actually strong
[79:26] it's like Twitter and YouTube and
[79:29] podcasts and this is just not the the
[79:33] right format. You also have to um see
[79:36] that my format is long form and that
[79:40] just turns out to be a little bit more
[79:43] older screwed. So I personally have
[79:47] since I'm like 18 19 years old always
[79:49] watched and listened to podcast. I I
[79:51] love that format so much and I probably
[79:53] learned a lot of things just from
[79:55] podcast and then like oh here's someone
[79:57] interesting then I bought his book and
[79:59] and dove deep into something. I just
[80:01] love podcast for getting ideas and
[80:04] getting inspirations and if there's
[80:05] something interesting diving deeper on
[80:07] that and uh I think that's one aspect
[80:10] that Bitcoin isn't as strong on on Tik
[80:14] Tok and on those Instagram reels and on
[80:16] those platforms. I try to put my podcast
[80:19] there but like it's a whole different
[80:21] reaction I get there from uh podcast uh
[80:24] replies and and YouTube comments on the
[80:26] long form. It's really fascinating to
[80:28] see. And then also um if you are under
[80:32] 20 years old, you probably have almost
[80:34] no money. So you maybe have like a
[80:36] thousand dollars laying around um if you
[80:39] then talk oh like let's have a 10 year
[80:42] time horizon and you invest some money
[80:43] you DCA in. It's kind of boring. If you
[80:46] have uh the someone saying on on YouTube
[80:50] to you, hey, you can 100x your money
[80:52] tomorrow with that XYZ token. Yeah, like
[80:56] that sounds more interesting if you just
[80:58] have like a little bit of money. And
[80:59] that's actually a lot of the um things
[81:02] that I get from the the the I call them
[81:06] shitcoiners, but like alcoin people. Uh
[81:09] I I get like, "Oh, Bitcoin is so boring.
[81:11] It just does like 40 50% a year. Like I
[81:14] cannot build anything with that." And
[81:16] I'm like, "Ah."
[81:18] So So you basically just want to gamble.
[81:20] Like let's let's call it what it is. You
[81:22] want to gamble. you want to go in a
[81:23] casino, bet on red and see what what
[81:27] what comes out the other end. Yes. So,
[81:29] absolutely. And I think to to just to
[81:31] wrap that up in that direction is people
[81:34] don't care when they're young about
[81:35] money. One thing is is absolutely that
[81:39] when I talk to people my age, a bit
[81:41] lower uh and I talk about Bitcoin, which
[81:44] I do, I really and I converted quite a
[81:46] few guys. I believe in it like by
[81:48] talking and like okay. Uh but the first
[81:52] reaction is always p is like you really
[81:54] lost your pla you're like selling drugs
[81:57] or crack and like oh like like opium
[81:59] like it's not I think it's like that's
[82:02] really this first reaction and only when
[82:05] I say listen unlike the guy from
[82:08] freaking s loan bank in Germany I don't
[82:12] make money out of that I don't it's like
[82:14] it's for you it's like it's it's free
[82:16] advice I don't want to have anything to
[82:18] do with that it's for free yeah I And
[82:20] like people still believe the guy from
[82:22] the sale and loan banks like well you
[82:24] know that live in all this like
[82:26] wonderful building somebody has to pay
[82:27] for that and very like it's going to be
[82:29] you. Uh so I think that's that's that's
[82:32] the wonderful idea here and I think when
[82:36] it comes to Bitcoin and I think we had
[82:38] overarching theme around the financial
[82:40] market
[82:41] system. What I found now last couple of
[82:44] days very interesting and it stuck with
[82:46] me. It's like from age Warren Buffett 94
[82:51] years old decided to step down as a
[82:53] chairman but have way 60 years like 20%
[82:57] annualized return fantastic best
[82:59] investor but such long-term I think ever
[83:02] live last
[83:04] century but he hates Bitcoin he think
[83:07] it's it's really bad stuff I think rat
[83:09] pie is now all bad words he used
[83:12] but interesting what he said about
[83:14] financial markets and currencies is
[83:17] first time I think where he said well I
[83:20] think it might be time to diversify away
[83:23] from the US dollar that's was
[83:26] interesting and secondly he said the
[83:30] incentive of governments is
[83:33] unfortunately it is what it
[83:35] is to be in a
[83:37] business to devaluate the currency
[83:40] that's just what they do he said I'm not
[83:42] saying they're evil people which I
[83:44] disagree I think they're freaking really
[83:46] evil people, really bad guys. But the
[83:49] guy is 94. He doesn't really want to but
[83:52] he he wants to when he if he dies, he
[83:54] wants to say I was a good guy. Um and it
[83:58] was interesting the first time where he
[84:00] actually say well the valuation of
[84:02] currency is was just inherent in this
[84:05] system and uh and maybe you want to
[84:08] divers away from US dollar. So a guy was
[84:10] like all American. So I thought like
[84:13] that is potentially even he doesn't like
[84:16] bit back like back when he talks about
[84:17] that bitcoin I think it was a very great
[84:20] advertising for
[84:22] bitcoin and it's it's interesting
[84:24] because uh when I started investing I
[84:27] consumed Warren Buffett content like
[84:30] crazy like the the Warren Buffett
[84:32] mindset of investing and and and looking
[84:34] at stocks was the the way I started
[84:37] actually with with stocks which later
[84:39] led me to to to discover Bitcoin. But we
[84:42] are already over time. Um we have two
[84:46] more questions. The first question is
[84:47] always the same question um for uh for
[84:50] for every guest. And the first question
[84:52] is what can we learn from you besides
[84:54] Bitcoin?
[84:57] Common sense apply common sense when you
[85:00] invest and in your life. I think common
[85:02] sense
[85:04] question pretty much don't take anything
[85:07] for face value. just challenge it with
[85:10] common sense. It's first principles
[85:12] thinking. I I like that. Um the second
[85:16] question is the end routine where the
[85:17] previous guest is asking a question for
[85:19] the next guest without knowing who the
[85:20] next guest actually is and uh the
[85:23] previous guest ask you the question,
[85:25] what is your most unpopular opinion
[85:28] about Bitcoin? My unpopular
[85:31] opinion, I think that it's the best
[85:33] asset class out there. That's my
[85:36] unpopular opinion. when you talk to
[85:37] bankers. That's true. It's it's also
[85:39] matters like unpopular to whom. Yeah.
[85:44] Really cool. Thank you so much uh Pers
[85:46] for for being on the podcast. Before I
[85:48] let you go, where can people find you
[85:49] and and ask you questions? Sure. U my my
[85:53] footprint is a simple one.
[85:55] It's an X. I'm literally only an X. I
[85:58] don't do LinkedIn. That's too much
[86:00] corporate uh eco chamber. I don't need
[86:02] that. Uh so it's P the banker. Uh so
[86:08] um so that's where they can find me.
[86:11] That's where I tweet mainly around
[86:13] Bitcoin, financial situations, but
[86:15] politics as well. Uh uh once in a while
[86:19] that make my plot boil. So I cannot help
[86:21] myself.
[86:23] So So that's that's the best way to find
[86:26] me. Thank you so much. Thanks. Great.
[86:29] Thanks. Thank you so much for being on
[86:31] PS. And also, thank you so much for
