[00:00] it's a massively bullish sign that Trump
[00:02] even went there we were talking about
[00:04] the president of the United States of
[00:06] America you can't get bigger than that
[00:07] really it makes me feel bullish about
[00:09] everything imagining him winning the
[00:11] election and after that yeah I think we
[00:12] are going to the Moon definitely we are
[00:14] going to the Moon I was one of the you
[00:15] know one of those sheep you know um just
[00:17] a few years ago but Bitcoin completely
[00:20] changed me these people are not going to
[00:23] go down without fighting just look at
[00:24] the bitcom conference the last 10 years
[00:27] the first one with like 100 people in in
[00:29] the in the conference room
[00:30] half empty and and Andreas atopis is
[00:33] speaking and nobody's listening 10 years
[00:35] later you have a conference with 20,000
[00:38] people they are lining up a whole day to
[00:40] get in to see the 47th president of the
[00:43] United States we'd like to see things
[00:45] like that in in in
[00:47] [Music]
[00:50] Europe and you just came from Prague
[00:52] here to Vienna just for a visit yes yes
[00:55] um well I've been in Austria before but
[00:58] never in Vienna so this is my first time
[01:00] so I'm looking forward to um you know
[01:02] discovering this city later on later
[01:03] this evening you know exploring
[01:06] different places in Vienna so yeah and
[01:09] and it's the home of Austrian
[01:11] economics it's really how far down the
[01:14] rabbit hole did you go with Austrian
[01:15] economics I mean a little bit is in
[01:17] every Bitcoin yeah and some went really
[01:20] deep uh some are like oh okay a little
[01:22] bit how how deep I must say I'm not
[01:25] really that deep but I'm aware of it
[01:27] yeah um I kind of learned the basics of
[01:29] it but I've got quite a few friends
[01:31] around me um I don't want to mention in
[01:34] the names but um there is this
[01:36] particular young lad I think he's 17
[01:38] maybe 18 now he's from Turkey he's mad
[01:41] about it I think he he must have read
[01:43] like I don't know at least seven eight
[01:44] maybe 10 books about it you know he's if
[01:48] if I have any trouble trust me I'm going
[01:49] to go to him you know he knows
[01:51] everything inside out but um yeah a
[01:54] economics is is is really you know
[01:55] important for all Bitcoins as well all
[01:57] Bitcoin is yeah yeah it's interesting
[01:59] for me because I am from Austria I
[02:01] studied for a short time economics in
[02:04] Austria and there is no Austrian
[02:05] economics I even talked with people that
[02:07] were having decrease in austan economics
[02:09] in Austria right but they never talked
[02:12] about uh aan economics it's not a not
[02:15] it's not it's all kesian uh things yeah
[02:18] yeah and we talked before uh What uh
[02:21] what you kind of like you are on a free
[02:24] 3 we STP so you did not like you did not
[02:27] wear in the Bitcoin space too much but
[02:28] you still heard about Trump right yes I
[02:30] did yes I did and um you know I read
[02:33] quite a few things um on Twitter about
[02:35] it and I thought okay is it really that
[02:37] bad you know I have to watch it for
[02:38] myself so um just a couple nights ago I
[02:41] watched
[02:42] it okay it wasn't all that but at the
[02:45] end of the day you know uh Donald Trump
[02:47] is a politician he promoted himself a
[02:49] lot as expected um and he said a few
[02:52] things about
[02:53] Bitcoin few more other things about
[02:55] crypto he just mixed it up as you know
[02:58] um it wasn't like pure Bitcoin stuff but
[03:00] um it is what it is it is what it is you
[03:02] know no bad you know they say you know
[03:04] there is no bad publicity you know
[03:08] so yeah and I think just the just the
[03:11] thing that he was around at the Bitcoin
[03:14] conference like that he uh came to the
[03:17] Bitcoin conference that's a huge thing
[03:18] like I think it is you know isn't it the
[03:20] first time a politician um goes to a
[03:23] Bitcoin conference or not the politician
[03:26] but the first time there's a
[03:28] presidential candidate for like even
[03:31] more that a presidential candidate
[03:33] likely win if nothing major happens that
[03:36] will never happened before yeah like RFK
[03:39] was last year also at the Bitcoin
[03:41] conference uh he's not a presidential
[03:43] candidate but that's that's a major
[03:45] thing it it is it is and
[03:47] um I mean imagine him winning the you
[03:51] know the presidency in November if I'm
[03:53] not wrong the um their election and
[03:56] it'll be interesting to see what happens
[03:57] after that um and then you have to think
[03:59] that's a bit that's a president of the
[04:02] United States that said Bitcoin to the
[04:04] Moon which is one quote of him he said
[04:07] never sell your Bitcoin that's it those
[04:10] are some I feel like uh we can focus on
[04:13] like oh he's said crypto a lot of times
[04:15] we can focus on what he not said uh but
[04:17] I think like it's a massively bullish
[04:20] sign that Trump even went there that he
[04:23] even said those things in the beginning
[04:25] and that that just a president is there
[04:28] at a Bitcoin conference yeah yeah I mean
[04:30] look um and I mean we're talking about
[04:33] you know the president ex president or
[04:35] the presidential candidate of the United
[04:37] States of America you can't get bigger
[04:38] than that really you know so um he's
[04:42] there um so it makes me feel bullish
[04:45] about everything really as I said you
[04:46] know um imagining him winning you know
[04:49] winning um winning the
[04:52] election and after that yeah I think we
[04:54] are going to the Moon definitely we are
[04:56] going to the moon
[04:58] and he mentioned the
[05:01] um the um American government having
[05:03] like
[05:04] 210,000 Bitcoins and then um I saw
[05:08] another politician lady I can't remember
[05:10] the her I can't remember the name of her
[05:12] but she said something like I don't know
[05:15] uh America will buy like what half a
[05:18] million Bitcoins or something like that
[05:20] remember yeah I mean yeah I mean things
[05:22] are happening I think you know things
[05:24] are happening but wouldn't you like to
[05:26] see something similar over here in
[05:28] Europe that that's that was my next
[05:31] question for you actually because uh I
[05:34] am as a European I had the European
[05:36] election uh and I searched for all
[05:39] austan parties I searched all programs I
[05:43] searched there for words like Bitcoin
[05:46] crypto and digital currencies everything
[05:49] like that yeah there was no word there
[05:50] was a word of the digital Euro yeah but
[05:54] nothing of Bitcoin nothing of not even
[05:56] cryptocurrencies was in there yeah I
[05:58] mean it is the same in the UK it is the
[06:00] same in the UK you know we had um our
[06:02] general election just just a few weeks
[06:04] about four weeks ago if I'm not wrong
[06:06] but nothing about Bitcoin I mean they
[06:09] have everything all types of
[06:11] restrictions you know against Bitcoin or
[06:14] crypto you know however you want to name
[06:16] it uh but when it comes to talking about
[06:18] Bitcoin they won't do it um and I know
[06:22] soon enough they're going to bring out
[06:23] the cbdcs as well um in the UK that's
[06:27] going to happen that's that's definitely
[06:29] going to happen and also in like in
[06:31] Europe as well European Union you know
[06:34] they're just working so hard to bring
[06:35] out the cbdcs in Europe and
[06:39] um we don't like it but it is what it is
[06:42] so what can you do just stack more
[06:43] Bitcoin that's what I do yeah and I
[06:45] think it's not bad for like Bitcoin or
[06:48] anything it's just bad for the for the
[06:50] region because people like me right now
[06:53] I'm thinking of like does is it worth it
[06:56] to leave the European Union is it worth
[06:58] to for getting somewhere else and maybe
[07:01] get some nade status get somewhere else
[07:04] citizenship and then travel around the
[07:06] world and leave the European Union uh I
[07:09] mean you're not no longer in the
[07:10] European Union because UK left it um
[07:14] like I think we discussed it last time
[07:16] was in the podcast but did it got better
[07:18] or worse uh and how is the UK is there
[07:21] any mention of Bitcoin no not at all I
[07:23] think it got worse I think it got worse
[07:26] in fact you know I feel like it's
[07:28] getting worse you know by the day not in
[07:31] just you know not in the UK only but
[07:34] generally speaking in Europe right in
[07:37] the UK we got a new government now um a
[07:39] labor government um and um so K St is
[07:43] the new prime minister he's been in
[07:46] power for the last what four year sorry
[07:48] four weeks but I have to tell you I
[07:50] haven't I haven't heard one single
[07:54] positive thing that considers the UK
[07:56] citizens nothing nothing in fact uh it
[08:00] was like within the first week he
[08:02] pledged um3
[08:05] billion to the um to Ukraine every year
[08:08] for as long as the war continues instead
[08:11] of saying oh you know what we're going
[08:13] to do anything we can to you know find
[08:15] the solution find you know peace um but
[08:19] no they're just supporting uh the war
[08:21] and I think the UK isn't the only
[08:23] country you know that does this so um
[08:27] yeah I think things are getting worse uh
[08:29] but again just like you I've got quite a
[08:30] few friends around me from Europe they
[08:33] are considering you know moving
[08:35] somewhere else but um the kind of
[08:39] friends I'm talking about they're either
[08:41] on their own or just you know with a
[08:43] girlfriend see for example if I talk
[08:45] about myself no I've got
[08:46] responsibilities I've got a child I've
[08:48] got you know I've everything I've got is
[08:52] here so it's a bit difficult and also um
[08:54] age wise I'm two years you know just two
[08:57] years away from 50 I am so I'm 48 yeah
[09:01] last week it was my birthday oh you're
[09:03] almost double me yeah yeah so um I
[09:06] really don't want to move around unless
[09:08] I have to um but yeah I mean just like
[09:13] you you know I've got a lot of people
[09:14] around me thinking about me you know
[09:16] leaving the European
[09:18] Union it's not an easy decision to make
[09:20] for anyone really yeah I think like it's
[09:24] uh it's a decision that you can either
[09:27] take now or maybe later or maybe it gets
[09:29] better uh but if if if things are
[09:32] progressing like at some point you have
[09:34] to make the decision if you leave a
[09:35] shining SE if if you if you really see
[09:38] it like that but it could get better
[09:40] like politicians always can get re uh
[09:43] some other politicians can get in and
[09:44] and like even in Europe you can see like
[09:47] uh the parties that are critical of the
[09:49] European Union they got stronger in in
[09:52] the last election so this is a massive
[09:54] sign a democratic sign uh that there's
[09:58] things happening
[09:59] um change might happen and and and I
[10:02] hope it happens you know for better
[10:04] obviously you know the way things are
[10:06] going at the moment I don't like it I
[10:07] don't think anyone does but um while we
[10:10] were talking I just remembered I've got
[10:13] um again this is a bitcoiner um I don't
[10:16] want to name the guy now but he actually
[10:18] told me a few weeks back that he wanted
[10:21] to buy an open ticket I I didn't know
[10:23] what an open ticket was it apparently
[10:25] it's just a you know a plane ticket but
[10:27] there's no date on it so you can use it
[10:28] anytime you want so if it's a normal
[10:30] ticket say like it's €500 you pay, 1500
[10:33] for this but an open ticket open
[10:36] destination he he said to me you know if
[10:39] anything happens if I feel it that's I'm
[10:41] just getting on a plane and I'm going
[10:42] wherever I want to go so I mean there
[10:44] are people out there making plans and I
[10:48] don't want to scare anyone but yeah I
[10:50] think people people people are feeling
[10:52] you know you know things aren't right so
[10:56] um yeah people are getting prepared I
[10:58] think for something interesting three
[11:00] questions that I want to give you each
[11:02] one of it individual right now to this
[11:05] topic okay the first question is for you
[11:07] what does freedom mean to
[11:09] you okay okay okay um Freedom
[11:14] um
[11:16] that that is a very deceptively you know
[11:19] simple question what does freedom mean
[11:21] to me freedom is I am one of those guys
[11:24] who believes um absolute freedom doesn't
[11:27] exist you know but freedom in general
[11:30] yeah Freedom me being able to do um
[11:34] whatever I want to do within reason that
[11:38] is um without having to
[11:41] um you know get any permit you know that
[11:44] that's Freedom you know in in the
[11:46] simplistic you know terms really um but
[11:49] do we have that freedom in the UK or in
[11:52] the European Union no and I I feel like
[11:55] you know every every month if not every
[11:58] week I hear about something something
[11:59] new some new restrictions you know been
[12:01] imposed on us so um yeah Freedom means a
[12:06] lot but do we have it I don't think so
[12:09] yeah do you consider yourself free no to
[12:14] a certain degree yes maybe seemingly
[12:17] compared to some other countries yes but
[12:19] within the society that we're liveing um
[12:22] not really no but also not individually
[12:25] no no because if I have to um live in
[12:28] IND UK trust me before you do anything
[12:31] you have to get a permit it's a
[12:32] simplistic things um you want to put a
[12:35] satellite dish outside your house a
[12:37] satellite dish you know to you know um
[12:39] yeah you have to get a permit from the
[12:41] local Council yeah it is like that it is
[12:43] like that um as I said you know it's
[12:47] it's a deceptively simple question but
[12:49] if you dive into it no it's not there is
[12:51] no you know simple answer for it yeah I
[12:55] was going with those questions uh
[12:57] because I really want to dive into how
[12:59] we can expand our freedom uh and what we
[13:02] can do and uh I feel like Bitcoin is the
[13:05] major First Step no matter what you want
[13:07] to do if you want to really have the
[13:10] most Freedom possible for you fre
[13:12] Bitcoin is the the the the fundamental
[13:15] to it because it's money right it's it's
[13:17] like the fundamental thing is there
[13:19] anything else that you're like this is
[13:20] the thing that I do to protect my
[13:22] freedom the the freedom that I have yeah
[13:25] right first of all you know like
[13:27] everybody everybody else like you myself
[13:29] you know I I I regularly stack Bitcoin
[13:32] but um as I said to you before we
[13:34] started this podcast um I'm stacking
[13:38] Bitcoin um not for my own freedom but
[13:42] hopefully for my daughter's freedom in
[13:44] the future because I you know things are
[13:46] going to get a lot worse in the future
[13:49] you know um I always tell my friends
[13:52] even in this you know um a broken Fiat
[13:54] world if I am kind of all right on my
[13:57] own I'm all right but thinking about my
[13:59] daughter's future I don't feel all right
[14:02] so um I stack
[14:04] regularly if I get to benefit from that
[14:08] I'm lucky but other other than that yeah
[14:10] I'm I'm I'm definitely stacking for my
[14:12] daughter's future and her
[14:15] Freedom yeah um in terms of what we can
[14:18] do there are plans uh future plans um of
[14:22] bitcoiners and and I'm always you know
[14:24] talking to these bitcoiners these
[14:26] bitcoiners literally you know want to
[14:28] get together and start their own little
[14:30] towns and you know um organizations and
[14:34] all that and um it's really intriguing
[14:36] really I I listen to these people I I
[14:38] speak to those people and um generally
[14:42] speaking they are not Europeans they're
[14:44] more Americans you know freedom and all
[14:47] that um but no uh who knows who knows
[14:50] you know where you will be you know a
[14:52] year from now 2 years from now um
[14:56] despite you know everything I just said
[14:58] you know I said I'm like 2 years away
[15:00] from 50 and everything who knows maybe 5
[15:02] years from now I'm going to be in one of
[15:03] those um Bitcoin towns you know I know
[15:07] yeah might be might be cool also maybe
[15:10] considering uh kids and maybe
[15:13] considering family like uh maybe it's
[15:16] better for them there in those Bitcoins
[15:17] definitely definitely um in terms of
[15:19] Education as well I mean my daughter is
[15:22] um almost 14 she goes to um school
[15:27] um but I'm always um suspicious not not
[15:30] just my daughter but you know suspicious
[15:33] about what the kids are learning at
[15:34] school yeah do do you uh review what
[15:39] she's learning in school oh yeah I mean
[15:41] it's just a standard things you know
[15:43] they teach you know geography math I
[15:45] don't know whatever you know all that
[15:47] fine fine but um kids um including my
[15:51] daughter you know she comes back with
[15:53] like extra stuff from school but it's
[15:55] not just the school either it's it's
[15:57] it's the social media
[15:59] you know from Tik Tok to Facebook
[16:01] whatever you know they use really kids
[16:05] um uh propaganda is all out there from
[16:09] the schools through social media TV um
[16:12] yeah propaganda is everywhere and if we
[16:14] can and if we can separate ourselves
[16:17] from that and and hope you know Bitcoin
[16:18] is are like that Bitcoin is um are aware
[16:20] of things as well and if we can educate
[16:23] our own kids in our values oh that would
[16:27] be perfect yeah I would live in a place
[16:29] like that what is the fundamental thing
[16:32] that we need I feel like critical
[16:33] thinking is something that is so
[16:35] important definely yes just two
[16:37] questions and a lot of people out there
[16:39] they they are you know incapable of
[16:42] asking those questions how and why just
[16:46] two questions how you know you you see
[16:48] something okay how does this happen and
[16:50] why does this happen critical thinking
[16:52] is just so important now was I always
[16:55] like this no I wasn't I was one of you
[16:57] know one of those sheep you know um just
[16:59] a few years ago but Bitcoin completely
[17:03] changed me and the way I see things the
[17:06] way I view things you know um it happens
[17:10] to everyone I'm sure I'm sure it
[17:12] happened to you it happened to you know
[17:13] everyone I know so I I feel so so safe
[17:17] in this community um you know when we
[17:20] talk about bit in fact Bitcoin we talk
[17:23] about Bitcoin but the majority of the
[17:25] subjects you know when you know we get
[17:28] together we talk about history we talk
[17:30] about economics we talk about the
[17:32] history of Economics right we we talk
[17:34] about you know diets eating meats you
[17:36] know and freedom and all that kind of
[17:39] stuff um so it's not just Bitcoin and
[17:41] I'll tell you over the last what three
[17:43] years I learned a lot much more than I
[17:46] ever
[17:47] knew um yeah I always say that um I was
[17:52] uh think about if I have a stock podcast
[17:56] think about me being in a stock podcast
[17:58] talking about which uh stocks to buy
[18:01] what to do what to look out for would
[18:03] also be an interesting topic but I would
[18:06] never talk about parenting and I
[18:10] had but and I have an episode with Lisa
[18:14] Huff on my show and she's like the the
[18:18] the the mother of ela yeah and we talked
[18:22] only about parenting yeah the whole
[18:24] episode was about parenting it was the
[18:26] second round with her and I was like
[18:27] let's pick a topic that you're also
[18:29] passion about that maybe also in Bitcoin
[18:32] but it's something a little bit outside
[18:34] and we talked about everything except
[18:36] Bitcoin yeah and the people loved it
[18:39] this was another that's fine and that's
[18:40] fine this is what I'm saying you know
[18:42] bitcoiners don't just talk about Bitcoin
[18:44] because there are like there only like
[18:46] so many things that you can say about
[18:48] Bitcoin and we say that all the you know
[18:50] we say all those things all the time and
[18:52] that's it we know all that but there are
[18:54] so many other things that Bitcoin is
[18:56] value as you say like parenting family
[18:59] um I don't know you know Freedom um
[19:01] history you know all that diet exactly
[19:04] diet um yes
[19:07] so I as I said you know I value you know
[19:11] these people and the information that
[19:13] the things I learned from them so I
[19:14] appreciate you know all my friends you

[19:33] finally we get together um that Bond you
[19:36] know yeah is there you can feel it so I
[19:39] enjoy every minute of it yeah I also
[19:41] feel like we should as we should meet as
[19:45] much as possible we should as bitcoiners
[19:49] those connections you make offline yes
[19:52] with other bitcoiners with likeminded
[19:55] people it's really great and there's so
[19:57] many possibilities in almost every city
[20:00] there's a Meetup yeah uh you can always
[20:03] download orange pill app yeah uh you can
[20:06] go to bitcoin conferences which are
[20:08] really big like the Bitcoin BR Bitcoin
[20:11] Nashville uh the madira one they're like
[20:14] just just open up Google and say like
[20:16] Bitcoin conferences there are so many so
[20:18] many now so there is no excuse to not
[20:21] meet other bitcoiners offline and the
[20:24] feedback I always get is it's so easy to
[20:27] make like man friends everyone is so
[20:29] open
[20:31] there exactly I mean look um in fact I
[20:35] tweeted about it just two days ago I
[20:37] think two three days ago look I mean I
[20:39] got to meet so many different people
[20:42] never mind Bitcoin is people and we all
[20:44] have like different characteristics
[20:45] different interests we're all different
[20:47] but we all unite in this one subject
[20:50] Bitcoin and
[20:52] um and you know the Bitcoin brings us
[20:55] together and then you get to know people
[20:57] yeah we have different interests and
[20:58] everything but then again oh you know
[20:59] what we agree on History we agree on you
[21:02] know economics we agree on not just one
[21:06] subject that is Bitcoin but also you
[21:07] know other stuff as well but um I don't
[21:10] know I'm an Arsenal supporter you might
[21:12] be a Manchester United supporter and
[21:14] that's fine but um yeah no generally
[21:16] speaking Bitcoin is once they meet yeah
[21:18] they get on well they really get on well
[21:20] yeah I love
[21:22] AA but but I'm not a huge football fan
[21:25] so so it's easy to say for me um really
[21:28] really cool before I go to the next
[21:31] topic I want to last on the community
[21:34] you are one of the vocal voices that
[21:36] wants to bring up more European uh
[21:38] bitcoiners on thisly I feel like that's
[21:40] one of the things that you try to do
[21:42] with c and stuff like that yes yes yes
[21:45] um look as English speakers you know
[21:48] um we are always exposed to we're always
[21:51] in American Bitcoin spaces and you know
[21:54] I've said this many times before so I'll
[21:55] say it one more time um love my American
[21:59] friends I love my Canadian friends right
[22:01] fine but and and when we're talking
[22:03] about Bitcoin again that's fine but
[22:06] quite often they talk about the issues
[22:08] in America the events the dates the the
[22:10] the names you know uh quite often I get
[22:13] lost because I don't know what they're
[22:15] talking about and this
[22:18] was early part of last year I thought
[22:22] you know what I think we need a European
[22:24] space for European bitcoiners you know
[22:26] we'll talk about bitco Bitcoin f but
[22:29] other than Bitcoin we can talk about the
[22:30] local issues in in Europe as well
[22:33] because you know we know what's going on
[22:35] in Europe um so I tried um a space
[22:38] called Cafe Europe um which hasn't been
[22:40] on for the last six weeks or so but um
[22:43] when I go back it it'll start again um
[22:47] but I find that European bitcoiners are
[22:50] so elusive um they will just pop in the
[22:54] space they won't even talk know 10
[22:56] minutes later they will leave and now my
[22:58] American friends come and support me so
[23:00] it's like you know it says Cafe Europe
[23:03] fine but full of Americans um I'd like
[23:07] to say you know I love all my American
[23:09] friends so I'm not I'm not having a go
[23:11] here but yeah Bitcoin is from Europe I
[23:14] don't know they don't really like spaces
[23:16] I guess I think it's also I mean I don't
[23:20] know for other countries but for German
[23:22] speaking countries they like to stay
[23:25] with German speaking spaces German
[23:27] speaking like feel they have a really
[23:30] bad English and they don't want to get
[23:32] on the English I think that's the
[23:34] language barrier is real I feel
[23:37] like but Robin I've been on the road for
[23:40] three weeks now you know I'm touring
[23:41] Europe um so France swizerland Italy
[23:45] Greece um Czech Republic now I'm here um
[23:49] hopefully if I've got sometime maybe
[23:50] I'll go to Netherlands and then back to
[23:52] UK one thing though Wherever I Go people
[23:56] speak English yeah people speak English
[23:59] so I don't know why they would feel like
[24:01] that but I would love to see more
[24:03] Europeans I would love to um you know
[24:06] meet more Europeans in this space or in
[24:09] in in you know real life you know during
[24:12] conferences and all that I'd love to do
[24:13] that I'd love to do that if it wasn't
[24:15] for like um Twitter I think yeah we met
[24:18] on Twitter first and then prag you were
[24:21] there you know with me a few weeks back
[24:24] yeah um no let's use the technology to
[24:26] get together you know to exchange ideas
[24:28] to discuss um whatever problems we have
[24:32] here in Europe yeah let's do that if you
[24:34] watch or listen to my podcast on a

[24:39] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[24:42] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them

[25:56] personal Bitcoin exchange 21 on bitcoin
[25:59] with code Robin you get a hefty discount
[26:02] for all your purchases in the future the
[26:05] thing that I meant this um for example
[26:08] we have Roman Rea he's the biggest the
[26:10] block trainer he's the biggest in in in
[26:12] Germany like he's you like if someone
[26:15] says like I want to learn about Bitcoin
[26:18] in a in a German speaking area he's the
[26:20] guy he has a News website with great
[26:22] articles he has a team behind him uh
[26:24] they are researching they're all like
[26:26] Bitcoin only they're focused on that
[26:29] this is high signal I even have him I
[26:32] just right when I was waiting for you I
[26:34] got the email that he will come on my
[26:37] podcast because I want to get those
[26:39] voices that are usually only in German
[26:41] speaking areas also on an English
[26:44] speaking space yeah it's not his first
[26:46] English um podcast but he he doesn't he
[26:49] didn't do a lot of English podcast I
[26:51] think there are like five or something
[26:52] like that that I could find maybe there
[26:54] more um and because there are in the
[26:58] German speaker I don't know if Spanish
[27:00] and all of other things but in German
[27:01] there are a lot of Supply on German
[27:05] content for Bitcoin like there is a lot
[27:08] of podcasts there are a lot of uh uh
[27:10] live streamers that almost do daily live
[27:13] stream yeah so you can really be just in
[27:16] a German speaking area just in a German
[27:18] speaking Bitcoin Community you don't
[27:20] even have to get out of uh the of your
[27:23] way because if you have the um as a
[27:26] German speaking guy you have the
[27:27] possibility to speak in a German Twitter
[27:30] space or English Twitter space you're
[27:31] like ah I just go on the English twit
[27:34] German Twitter space I was I'm one of
[27:38] the examples
[27:39] that likes English more than German uh
[27:43] there a lot of reason I got in those
[27:46] reason a lot in the podcast so I will
[27:48] not not not explain them too much but I
[27:50] think that's a that's a huge thing that
[27:52] Europe has so many different languages
[27:54] languages and America has English I mean
[27:57] America has no official language as I
[27:59] learned from an American friend of me
[28:01] yeah uh but they all speak English yeah
[28:04] yeah they do they do um now another
[28:07] example is um you know I'm a native
[28:09] Turkish speaker right um I haven't come
[28:13] across any Turkish you know Bitcoin
[28:15] spaces either oh and yet there's a um
[28:18] you know great strong hardcore Bitcoin
[28:21] Community there they've got a telegram
[28:22] group I know they they talk and quite
[28:24] often the language they choose to speak
[28:26] in is English
[28:29] um but I've never seen any Turkish
[28:32] Bitcoin space now every now and then I
[28:34] go into um Turkish spaces and people see
[28:37] my laser eyes you know so they ask me
[28:40] questions um and I try to answer their
[28:44] questions you know as much as possible
[28:46] but the interest I get from normal
[28:48] people that actually that makes me feel
[28:50] good so even normal people are asking
[28:53] questions at least you know what is this
[28:54] what's going on how you know how do we
[28:56] how do I do it how you know so how how
[28:59] does that work so yeah yeah there there
[29:02] is definitely interest and you know it
[29:04] makes me H happy yeah especially in
[29:06] turkey with such a high I mean we have
[29:08] high inflation all around the world but
[29:10] in Turkey especially oh yeah I mean
[29:12] that's another I think last time we we
[29:14] talked about it now up until last month
[29:17] the inflation was this is quite um funny
[29:21] now you're going to laugh at it last
[29:23] month it was like just over 70% this
[29:26] month they declared that inflation is
[29:28] down to
[29:29] 26% exactly exactly but um you know I'm
[29:34] always in touch with my Turkish friends
[29:36] my cousin in Turkey even this morning I
[29:38] had a little chat uh with someone in
[29:40] Turkey nobody is feeling it it's 26% is
[29:44] just I don't know they must have said oh
[29:47] you know what let's just say it's 26%
[29:48] that's it's just a figure on on a piece
[29:50] of paper it just doesn't exist yeah I
[29:53] feel like sometimes they might try with
[29:56] those low numbers to bring inflation
[29:58] down because I feel like if if everyone
[30:00] if you if you can actually agree the the
[30:03] national narrative that everything is
[30:06] 26% uh people feel like that and then
[30:10] they are a little bit more it's a
[30:11] psychological it's a psychology game
[30:13] because
[30:15] if if inflation is like known is like
[30:19] 200% then as a restaurant you're way
[30:21] more likely oh I can also increase my
[30:23] prices like I feel like there's an
[30:25] there's an an real impact you can have
[30:27] with Out official numbers that are lower
[30:30] but in the end of the day you cannot
[30:31] fake it like there you can't the
[30:34] inflation will come no matter what
[30:35] numbers you would right oh yeah I mean
[30:37] things are so bad that I don't know say
[30:39] like you're a turkey citizen you go and
[30:41] do your shopping and today you pay I
[30:43] don't know say like I don't know 1,500
[30:45] Turkish your shopping next week you go
[30:48] back you will almost 100 well say 99%
[30:51] certain that you will pay
[30:53] 1,600 you know from week to week in from
[30:55] day-to-day prices change
[30:58] um it is bad and also um in the last few
[31:02] days um there's like some other stuff
[31:04] going on in Turkey I don't know there's
[31:06] a problem with like stray dogs and all
[31:08] that so the government passed a new law
[31:10] to um take things under control but then
[31:12] again in two about three days ago the
[31:16] president erogan said something like oh
[31:19] you know if Israel doesn't stop we will
[31:21] invade Israel and all that kind of stuff
[31:23] but I'm thinking hang on a minute hang
[31:24] on hang on a minute something else is
[31:26] going on here I think
[31:28] they are trying to I don't know take
[31:31] people's attentions away from the real
[31:34] issue which is the economy so while
[31:36] people's people's minds are busy with
[31:38] all this like new
[31:40] stuff I reckon in the next other don't
[31:42] know few weeks um Turkish Lio might lose
[31:45] more value against the American dollar
[31:48] so I think at the moment $1 is like
[31:51] 33 Turkish l or something I don't know
[31:53] in the next few weeks if it goes up to
[31:55] like 35 36 I won't be surprised yeah
[31:59] yeah that's that's super interesting
[32:01] what's what's going on um let's talk a
[32:03] little bit more about about Bitcoin we
[32:06] have like four years ago we had no like
[32:09] four and a half years ago we had no
[32:10] public company in there we had no
[32:12] country in there we had no president
[32:14] talking about it and now like just four
[32:17] or five years later everyone is doing it
[32:19] yeah everyone has talking about it like
[32:22] um do you have some framework to think
[32:24] about what what Bitcoin might look like
[32:26] in 5 10 20 years do you have some some
[32:29] predictions what what's going on with
[32:31] Bitcoin in 20 years not not only price
[32:33] oh okay um in terms of predictions yeah
[32:37] in price I don't want to say anything I
[32:38] think there's like there are enough
[32:39] people there you know that um my
[32:43] personal thing in my personal opinion
[32:45] and if I'm wrong uh please someone
[32:47] correct me I just don't think that full
[32:51] Bitcoin adoption will happen in the next
[32:52] I don't know four five maybe 10 years I
[32:55] can't see that happening with will it
[32:58] happen at some point in the future
[33:00] definitely but not in the next few years
[33:02] 20 years 25 years 30 years who knows
[33:05] because um America okay the Fiat system
[33:08] as we know it it is still there it's a
[33:10] fact right so which one is the um you
[33:14] know world currency that is the American
[33:16] dollar so but before the American dollar
[33:18] collapses there are like another like
[33:20] 180 90 currencies that has to collap F
[33:24] collapse first then the American dollar
[33:27] and that will take
[33:28] time I mean what are we going to do you
[33:29] know with Euro Euro has to collapse as
[33:32] well you know so I think that will take
[33:35] a bit of time because I know these
[33:37] people are not going to go down without
[33:40] fighting but Bitcoin as I always say
[33:42] Bitcoin is inevitable it will happen
[33:45] yeah my theory is that in 2044 or around
[33:51] 20 years from now 20 years from now yeah
[33:53] uh that it will be so extremely obvious
[33:58] that Bitcoin is the best savings
[34:00] technology ever and not only to our
[34:02] small Bitcoin Community it will be like
[34:05] uh mainstream like oh yeah you have
[34:07] money like save it in Bitcoin it's safe
[34:09] there I think in 20 years we will
[34:11] succeed with that I think uh medium of
[34:14] exchange will be becoming to developed
[34:17] it will be already like you can spend
[34:19] your Bitcoin on a lot of places yeah I
[34:21] can see that yeah uh and I think in like
[34:24] when you look at like phone like let's
[34:27] say like iPhone like how long are they
[34:29] here like 15 years uh and we have now
[34:33] look 20 years back uh nobody was running
[34:36] around with with his phone like that and
[34:38] like that now nobody can get away we
[34:41] have to invent like lock boxes for
[34:43] people that lock their own phones in a
[34:45] box because they're so addicted to their
[34:47] own phones that's right that's right and
[34:49] I think people will will be in a
[34:51] positive way addicted to bitcoin um
[34:53] you're right yeah I can see that
[34:55] happening what I'd like to see
[34:58] that
[34:59] um Bitcoin the technology if it can be
[35:02] somehow simplified more user friendly
[35:05] for Norm for like normal people um I
[35:08] think the adoption process you know uh
[35:12] will be even faster because a lot of
[35:14] people even now today you know a lot of
[35:16] Bitcoin conversations especially the
[35:18] technical side right can be so confusing
[35:21] yeah you know if you can be simplified
[35:24] for people I and and I don't know I
[35:26] don't even know what I'm trying to say
[35:27] here right but I'm just saying just
[35:29] simplify it say like the um you know
[35:31] self- custody for example um self-
[35:34] custody now I find it easy and simple
[35:37] but
[35:38] try to explain it to nor
[35:41] me yeah and it it's a
[35:44] journey because first you're like oh
[35:47] nice I got Bitcoin and then everyone on
[35:50] Twitter says like oh you have to take it
[35:51] off exchange and I'm like what like I
[35:53] cannot just leave it on Exchange like my
[35:55] my uh stocks I have yeah or like a bank
[35:57] account yeah and and then you take uh
[36:00] your first hardare wallet for example
[36:02] bitbox is one of my sponsors uh you you
[36:04] you get your first your bitbox like your
[36:07] Hardware wallet and you're like you put
[36:08] it there and like oh but what happens
[36:10] when I lose my bitbox then you get in
[36:12] like oh backup seat phrases then you're
[36:14] like oh but it's just a piece of paper
[36:15] you can burn then you get in like Steel
[36:17] W Ste then then you're like oh but when
[36:21] someone comes to my home he can just
[36:22] take it right oh but five key free keys
[36:25] like m signatur
[36:28] and then you're like oh collaborative
[36:32] cies like it's a rabbit hole in itself I
[36:35] know I know and I see see all that I
[36:37] think um now I'm in it now I'm
[36:39] interested in and there is so much for
[36:42] me to learn never mind a beginner I
[36:45] don't know if things could be somehow
[36:47] simplified as I said I don't even know
[36:49] what I'm trying to say here I'm just
[36:51] saying I'm just using the word like
[36:52] simplify just to um get more people on
[36:55] board bit easier
[36:58] um that would be great but then again if
[37:01] this is what it is that's fine you know
[37:03] people have to people people have to
[37:04] just people have to just you know run
[37:07] down the rabbit hole and learn that's it
[37:09] I I like to look at 10 years in the in
[37:12] the history of Bitcoin and how hard it
[37:14] was to even get Bitcoin in the in the in
[37:16] the early days and how easy it's now
[37:19] become in most countries and then
[37:22] extrapolate that exponential because as
[37:24] the price grows the value uh net
[37:28] purchasing power of Bitcoin as grow the
[37:30] more people will come in and the more
[37:32] incentives there are for companies to
[37:35] build better stuff like just just look
[37:38] at the bitco conference the last 10
[37:39] years the first one with like 100 people
[37:42] in in the in the conference room half
[37:44] empty and and Andreas atopis is speaking
[37:47] and nobody's listening 10 years later
[37:49] you have uh conference with 20,000
[37:52] people where like they are lining up a
[37:54] whole day to get in to see the uh next
[37:57] the 47th president of the United States
[38:00] speaking about Bitcoin like that's
[38:02] a yeah yeah yeah definitely as I said
[38:05] you know we'd like to see things like
[38:06] that in in in Europe and and why stop in
[38:10] Europe you do it do it in Asia as well
[38:12] you know um no Bitcoin is inevitable
[38:16] sooner or later you know whether they
[38:17] like it or not no they're going to come
[38:19] on board CU they have to otherwise
[38:20] they're going to be you know left behind
[38:22] you know like so many people I feel like
[38:25] you know as bitcoiners we are where we
[38:26] are now fine
[38:27] but 10 20 is from now as we said earlier
[38:31] um yes you know Bitcoin will be used as
[38:34] like normal day daily money maybe but I
[38:37] feel that a lot of people will be um
[38:40] Left Behind and I don't know if you if
[38:43] you can understand what I'm trying to
[38:44] say because we're just stack in as much
[38:45] as we can and it's not just us now the
[38:48] banks are buying Bitcoin now the
[38:49] governments are buying Bitcoin um uh
[38:53] okay so you know what's my part in this
[38:56] I am trying to
[38:58] speak to as many people as I can and try
[39:01] to orange peel them trying to you know
[39:03] explain what this is and how it works uh
[39:06] compared to the normal money a normal
[39:09] you know Financial system um but so
[39:12] that's my part um and if if I can do it
[39:15] you know if I can orange peel even more
[39:17] people yeah is is that the the best
[39:20] thing uh everyone can do orange pill
[39:24] their neighbors orange pill the people
[39:26] they love um no not necessarily I think
[39:28] people have different parts you know um
[39:30] I know you you spoke to you know a few
[39:32] technical people developers and all that
[39:34] they've got their their job you know
[39:35] that they do what they do and you know
[39:38] we're all grateful for what they do
[39:39] right fine um but as a normal player as
[39:42] a non technical person I still feel like
[39:45] I have a part to play in this you know
[39:47] Bitcoin Community you know I'm not just
[39:50] here to stack and talk whatever now what
[39:53] is my job um I'm a natural mediator
[39:56] believe you or not um and I've I've
[39:59] always been like that I actually bring
[40:00] people together right that's what I do
[40:03] um and and I do it's just just a natural
[40:06] talent I don't get paid for it or
[40:07] anything like that and I can attach to
[40:09] that because you brought a lot of people
[40:11] already on my podcast but but that's
[40:13] that's what I do you know um you know I
[40:15] bring friends together say like in my
[40:17] where I where I live you know if people
[40:20] need other night a particular Trader and
[40:21] they don't know so I I know people so I
[40:23] I bring people together so um and in
[40:27] within the Bitcoin Community I'm
[40:28] thinking you know I can do the same
[40:30] thing you know bring people together and
[40:31] explain Bitcoin bring people on board
[40:33] you know orange P them um that's my
[40:36] natural tal talent and you know I'll
[40:38] just use it I'll just use it why not
[40:40] yeah I I love that a lot yeah uh which
[40:43] brings me to one question that I now ask
[40:45] all my guests uh before the end routine
[40:48] um what can we learn from you besides
[40:50] Bitcoin and besides the things that we
[40:51] talked about from me yes I do that
[40:57] I I I put that question now because I
[41:00] feel like bitcoiners are such unique
[41:04] personalities and when we only talk
[41:06] about Bitcoin and the Bitcoin podcast we
[41:08] never get to know the other sides or we
[41:11] we can learn from each other a little
[41:13] bit better if we purposely expose the
[41:16] things that we know outside of Bitcoin
[41:18] because I got to know about citizenships
[41:21] and everything like that because of
[41:22] bitcoiners I got to know about diet
[41:25] because of bitcoiners so I think there
[41:27] are a lot of other topics that we can
[41:28] learn about and I I'm just curious like
[41:31] sometimes what can you learn from me I
[41:32] don't know I'm a I'm I'm a great
[41:34] traveler traveler um I love traveling
[41:37] you know I love driving so there is that
[41:39] but um uh something that I never talk
[41:41] about and this is something different um
[41:44] something I never talk about in spaces
[41:45] because it never comes up um my
[41:48] background is actually martial arts you
[41:50] know I've been I've been in karate yeah
[41:52] since 1989 since I was
[41:54] 13 um I've got um in European
[41:58] championships I've got quite a few
[41:59] medals as well so that's that's my past
[42:02] you know um you know you can learn that
[42:05] from me if you want to learn it um other
[42:08] than
[42:09] that man I I don't know really you know
[42:12] that that's a very sudden question now
[42:14] what can I learn from you I don't know
[42:15] you could yeah martial arts is a great
[42:18] one it is um I've always been even as a
[42:22] child I've always been a physical person
[42:25] right um I can't see myself sitting in
[42:28] you know sitting at a des and work you
[42:29] know from 8 till 5:00 I can't do that
[42:32] even you know
[42:33] today uh my job is you know I I work
[42:36] outside you know I work physically I do
[42:38] like Building Maintenance and all that
[42:39] so I've always been physical um but when
[42:42] it comes to martial
[42:45] arts as a small kid I was a bit naughty
[42:48] I think you know I used to I always I
[42:50] was always in F if like local kids and
[42:52] that but yeah once I started karate I
[42:54] thought oh you know what you can fight
[42:55] and you can get medals for it all right
[42:57] let's go you know that's how it started
[43:00] but later in life you know it calmed me
[43:03] calmed me down a lot and even today um
[43:08] I'm not a competitor competitor anymore
[43:10] but I'll tell you karate effects um uh
[43:14] almost you know every aspect aspect of
[43:16] my life because there is that um
[43:19] resilience you know you have to go you
[43:21] have to go you have to push push push
[43:23] that's that's what you do in karate you
[43:24] know uh during training during you know
[43:27] competition so even at work you know
[43:30] push push push while I'm stacking push
[43:32] push push you know so yeah I apply you
[43:35] know
[43:36] karate you know for everything in my
[43:38] life and now that I'm thinking about is
[43:42] it's if you want to be a sovereign
[43:44] individual to a certain extent it can be
[43:47] very helpful to be at least capable of
[43:51] dealing with uh I mean you don't want to
[43:54] get in fights in real life on street
[43:56] fights because you never as much as yeah
[43:58] you never know what the other person has
[43:59] in his pocket yeah yeah but but it it
[44:03] could save your life definitely
[44:05] definitely um and and and you know first
[44:09] of all any kind of support is sports
[44:12] right if you got a child sport I don't
[44:13] know gymnastics karate swimming I don't
[44:16] know Judo whatever Sports I don't know
[44:19] they they teach kids discipline that's
[44:20] one thing and secondly martial arts you
[44:23] know I would recommend not right about
[44:26] Judo to every everyone um I love Judo I
[44:29] follow Judo I don't do Judo myself I
[44:32] appreciate that sport um you know so
[44:34] much but as you say if you're in a
[44:36] situation and if you know what to do how
[44:38] to defend yourself at least you know
[44:40] you'll have a chance um so in that sense
[44:43] yeah it's great it's great one last
[44:45] question on that a lot of people uh I
[44:48] see when when they talk about uh martial
[44:50] arts they like oh I don't want to do it
[44:53] I probably hurt myself it's it's like in
[44:55] training uh is is is Judo something safe
[44:58] to train or it is it is definitely
[45:00] there's no age for it it's like karate
[45:02] Judo and whatever you want to do there
[45:04] is no age for it you can start at the
[45:06] age of what 7 17 or 47 5 77 whatever um
[45:11] but you have to be aware of the fact
[45:14] that it is a you know physical support
[45:16] you know sport you know dur during a
[45:17] training yes you will fall or you will
[45:19] get hit
[45:20] but um these I don't know martial arts
[45:23] clubs they're so professional you know
[45:26] they won't let you
[45:27] um you know harm yourself you know
[45:30] accidents might happen like everything
[45:32] else but other than that they they I can
[45:34] say you know they're completely safe
[45:35] definitely for for me it's always like
[45:38] uh when you talk about safety like you
[45:40] you can avoid martial art and then you
[45:43] go into your I don't know chess games
[45:46] and on the way to the chess game you get
[45:48] hit by the bus
[45:50] like safet is always like a weird topic
[45:54] because even if you go to safest rout
[45:57] you might die yeah or you definitely die
[46:00] but you might actually yeah I mean I'll
[46:03] just say you know just because you know
[46:04] Marshall I don't I wouldn't want anyone
[46:06] to go I know maral and then yeah you get
[46:10] knocked out right there that's
[46:11] embarrassing as well
[46:13] yeah amazing perfect then uh let's get
[46:16] into our end routine our end routine is
[46:18] where the previous guest is asking a
[46:20] question for our next guest without
[46:21] knowing who the next guest actually is

[47:05] just a little bit that's fine as well
[47:06] but otherwise that's for my daughter's
[47:08] uh future and um Bitcoin and all the
[47:12] benefits all the freedom that that it's
[47:15] going to bring it's going to provide for
