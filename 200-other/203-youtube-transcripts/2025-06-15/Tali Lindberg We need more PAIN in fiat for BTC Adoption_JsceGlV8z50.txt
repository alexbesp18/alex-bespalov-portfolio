[00:00] until you're experiencing pain you're
[00:01] not looking for a solution we need
[00:03] inflation every currency and it has to
[00:05] be really bad and people have to suffer
[00:07] a lot before we get the mainstream to
[00:10] adopt Bitcoin Bitcoin probably six out
[00:12] of seven times is portrayed as a scam we
[00:15] don't just go in front of somebody and
[00:16] say hey let me tell you about Bitcoin
[00:18] why it's valuable because they haven't
[00:19] been prepped yet they're not ready for
[00:21] that piece of of information they're so
[00:23] busy trying to survive they don't even
[00:26] have the time to stop and think what is
[00:28] the problem why is this happening does
[00:30] it have to be happening right now I
[00:32] don't think any college student is under
[00:34] any illusion that they can graduate
[00:35] college and go byy a house like their
[00:37] grandparents did they're under no such
[00:38] illusion they know that they have a very
[00:41] tough road in front of them my eyes were
[00:43] here but it wasn't until I went into the
[00:45] Bitcoin space where I was just like
[00:46] zoomed down I'm like oh I understand now
[00:48] and then I just got mad money is a
[00:50] mindset in that if you're poor in Fiat
[00:52] you can also be poor huddling a lot of
[00:56] [Music]
[00:58] Bitcoin what do you think is the most
[01:01] important aspect of of Bitcoin education
[01:04] the most important aspect of Bitcoin
[01:06] education is to realize that there are
[01:09] many
[01:11] steps in a person's Journey before
[01:15] Bitcoin would make sense to them so for
[01:18] those people who already come looking
[01:21] for Solutions and they find Bitcoin they
[01:24] slip down the rabbit hole really fast
[01:27] because they've been prepped like all
[01:28] the the little checks have happened
[01:30] already we just weren't a part of that
[01:33] so if we're trying to orange pill people
[01:37] it's important that we don't just go in
[01:39] front of somebody and say hey let me
[01:40] tell you about Bitcoin why it's valuable
[01:42] because they haven't been prepped yet
[01:43] they're not ready for that piece of of
[01:46] information first you have to gauge
[01:48] where they are in their awareness of
[01:50] whether or not there's a problem with
[01:52] our monetary system and what's going on
[01:54] because a lot of people are not even
[01:56] aware that there's a problem they sort
[01:58] of you know put their head down and
[01:59] there's is going through the Daily Grind
[02:01] of making ends meets you know do I need
[02:04] a second job do I need to budget my food
[02:07] instead of eating you know beef I'm G to
[02:08] eat just eggs or something like that you
[02:10] know so they're so busy trying to
[02:14] survive they don't even have the time to
[02:17] stop and think what is the problem why
[02:20] is this happening does it have to be
[02:21] happening right now they kind of accept
[02:23] it and then they just do their best to
[02:25] deal with it I've come across a lot of
[02:27] college students who are exactly in that
[02:29] mind set because you know Scott and I we
[02:32] of course really care about the next the
[02:34] next Generation which is why our
[02:36] company's named free market kids and so
[02:38] we've done a lot of we've had a lot of
[02:40] conversations with college kids and we
[02:42] just think you know for sure they're so
[02:45] ready because they know that um there's
[02:48] a problem I don't think any college
[02:50] student is under any illusion that they
[02:52] can graduate college and go by a house
[02:54] like their grandparents did they're
[02:56] under no such illusion they know that
[02:58] they have a very tough road in front of
[03:00] them but if you ask them well why is
[03:02] that happening do you think it should be
[03:04] happening 100% of the people I spoke to
[03:08] just say well it's that's just the way
[03:10] it is and we just have to live with it
[03:12] we just have to make the best of it and
[03:14] so when we're talking about Bitcoin
[03:15] education I think it's just important
[03:17] that we realize that there there are
[03:18] different steps and we like which part
[03:21] of that that progress do you want to
[03:23] Target because you can't do all of it
[03:26] there are I think we we are very heavy
[03:27] on the you know the step where they're
[03:31] right in front of the Bitcoin rabbit
[03:32] hole and you're just kind of pushing
[03:34] them to go down but but you there are
[03:37] some brick crumbs that we need to work
[03:38] on and and I think that's that's one of
[03:40] the things that I really want to get the
[03:42] message out is first you got to prep the
[03:45] customer so that they're ready for that
[03:48] purchasing um
[03:50] decision and the prep is I think where
[03:52] we need to um have some more work in the
[03:57] Bitcoin space how does this prep work I
[04:00] feel like a lot of like there's this
[04:02] concept in marketing that you have to
[04:03] see something like seven times or nine
[04:05] times like different studies shows
[04:07] different things before we buy something
[04:09] or before we take a decision um is it
[04:11] just like using Bitcoin randomly in
[04:14] conversations and just uh getting the
[04:16] name out there or the idea of of free
[04:19] market and the idea of of sound money or
[04:22] how do you how do you see that uh laying
[04:24] the the preparation work for for getting
[04:26] in the rabbit hole Yeah so I think think
[04:29] awareness is number one if you think
[04:31] marketing you have awareness um and then
[04:34] you have people who have tried something
[04:37] you know they're aware and they've tried
[04:39] some stuff and then you have people who
[04:40] are aware they've tried some stuff and
[04:42] all the stuff have failed and then you
[04:44] offer a solution that's you know of the
[04:46] three groups of C potential customers
[04:48] you want to Target the ones that are
[04:51] aware of the problem have tried stuff
[04:53] have failed and now they're very
[04:54] frustrated just desperate for a solution
[04:57] those are the ones that are ready to buy
[04:58] your idea right and so I think the
[05:00] awareness part is where we're missing it
[05:03] because if we if I go up to you let's
[05:05] say right and um and you you're brought
[05:09] up in the Christian household and your
[05:11] family life was happy your community
[05:13] supportive and I come to you and say hey
[05:16] everything you've been told is wrong
[05:18] actually Christianity is wrong you're
[05:20] going to be like get out of here why are
[05:22] you talking you know talking to me about
[05:24] this but let's say you you were brought
[05:27] up in the Christian church and your
[05:28] family was abusive
[05:30] and your church was really messed up and
[05:32] I come to you and go hey something's
[05:33] wrong with the Christianity beliefs um
[05:35] maybe you should consider something else
[05:37] then you'll be like yeah tell me what
[05:39] you have to say so it just you know that
[05:41] awareness level so if you go to someone
[05:43] who you know has a pretty nice nest egg
[05:47] right they're they're feeling pretty
[05:48] good their job has been secure they
[05:50] haven't gone through luckily they
[05:51] haven't gone through any layoffs you go
[05:53] up to them and go you know there's
[05:55] something really wrong with the monetary
[05:56] system they're going to be like what
[05:58] it's fine I'm fine
[06:00] what is your problem you know get out of
[06:02] here so that awareness piece I think is
[06:04] where we need to start spreading the
[06:05] breadcrumbs which is why um before we
[06:08] started recording I mentioned that I
[06:11] want to get to an audience as young as
[06:14] possible and um so I'll just use another
[06:18] example when my kids were really little
[06:20] and my oldest one was only four I was
[06:23] talking to a friend of M and she said
[06:25] have you talked to your daughter about
[06:26] sex and I said why on Earth what I to
[06:29] talk to my four-year-old about sex and
[06:32] she said well you want to be the first
[06:34] in front of her
[06:36] discussing what it is and should be and
[06:38] self-respect and things like that
[06:40] because you don't know where they're
[06:41] going to get that information and once
[06:43] the sea has been planted now you're
[06:45] fighting an uphill battle to dissuade
[06:48] them from their first belief so you want
[06:50] to be the first one exposing them to the
[06:52] idea that your body is to be respected
[06:55] it is not to be flung around or whatever
[06:58] and so she told me when my daughter was
[07:01] 4 years old that I should start with sex
[07:03] education now of course we don't go into
[07:05] details we just kind of very very like
[07:08] high level talk about how it's about
[07:11] love it's about two committed people
[07:12] that kind of stuff that's it that's all
[07:14] we talk about but you're planting little
[07:16] seeds and then when they turn six
[07:18] there's a follow-up book and then you
[07:19] talk a little bit deeper about that and
[07:21] then when they turn eight it's another
[07:23] book a little bit longer a little bit
[07:25] more details when they 10 you've been
[07:27] laying the groundwork and then you say
[07:29] hey
[07:30] um in this case in the Christian
[07:32] Community of course we believe that you
[07:34] know you you should um respect your body
[07:38] like a like a living Temple right and so
[07:40] you kind of get into the full message of
[07:43] it but you don't wait until they're 10
[07:45] years old to give them the full message
[07:47] and so the Super K of Interest which I
[07:49] was telling you about is my effort to
[07:50] reach the youngest population and get in
[07:53] front of them and start planting the
[07:55] seeds so of course we're not going to be
[07:57] like hey guess what the government is
[07:59] printing money and uh your savings in
[08:01] the pigy bank uh 5 years from now it's
[08:03] going to be worth nothing you don't want
[08:05] to say that to a little kid right but it
[08:08] is happening and we can tell them very
[08:10] high level and so the books that I'm
[08:12] writing are number one supposed to be
[08:15] fun just just a fun kid book and then
[08:17] number two you just like just kind of
[08:20] drop a little breadcrumb just in there
[08:21] so the first book is just addressing the
[08:24] issue of inflation which I think little
[08:27] kids would pick up here and there from
[08:29] parents saying oh this so expensive um
[08:31] the price of eggs are going up the price
[08:32] of milk is going up that kind of thing
[08:35] but that doesn't translate to their
[08:37] personal pain you know you until you're
[08:40] experiencing pain you're not looking for
[08:42] a solution and so for the for the first
[08:45] book the way I'm kind of spreading this
[08:47] the the cookie crumbs I call it is um so
[08:50] there's a little boy his name is k he's
[08:53] seven years old he makes a mistake he
[08:54] breaks his mom's face and I don't have
[08:58] him bailed out by just saying I'm sorry
[09:01] I don't have him bailed out by the
[09:02] parents going you know we'll just
[09:04] replace it and then you just have to
[09:07] never do it again because there are
[09:09] consequences in life if you break
[09:11] something as an adult you have to pay
[09:12] for it so we so in the book I don't bail
[09:14] him out and so he turns into his Ultra
[09:17] ego he puts on that c he's like I'm
[09:19] super K and I can solve this problem so
[09:22] he works really hard he's doing chores
[09:24] he's saving up money and then he goes to
[09:26] the flower shop and the price has
[09:28] increased he's saving up $10 he gets to
[09:31] the flower shop the price has gone up to
[09:32] 15 and that's a reality that we all face
[09:35] every day but for a child to make it
[09:38] very real and very personal and make a
[09:41] mark so that you're planting that
[09:43] seed it has to fit their life
[09:46] circumstance and what they understand
[09:48] what they relate to so that's the way
[09:50] that I see um that awareness at least
[09:53] that's one one aspect of doing it is
[09:56] just to start planting seeds now for
[09:59] adults it the awareness part has to come
[10:02] even less directly because like I said
[10:06] if if everything we have known has
[10:08] brought us here and I'm not currently
[10:11] experiencing extreme pain there's no
[10:14] reason for me to hear about something
[10:16] alternative like Bitcoin I mean it's
[10:20] so it's so abstract to at least people
[10:24] my generation and older and maybe even a
[10:27] few generation like one generation
[10:29] following me um it's just such a foreign
[10:32] concept the the whole digital currency
[10:34] thing and so I don't know that's just
[10:36] the way I see education that I feel like
[10:39] just needs a little bit more fleshing
[10:41] out in the Bitcoin Community it's
[10:44] interesting when you uh talk about
[10:45] inflation uh I I'm not out a lot I'm
[10:49] mostly in my studio and recording
[10:51] podcast but sometimes I go out and
[10:53] sometimes I listen to other people that
[10:55] are completely that are completely
[10:57] strangers to me H and I just like in the
[10:59] in the uban or sit some somewhere where
[11:02] I can listen to people that talk to each
[11:03] other but don't have any relation to me
[11:06] and it's fascinating how often inflation
[11:10] comes up in a direct to indirect way
[11:13] where they're like oh wow like I was um
[11:16] the other day I have this thing where
[11:18] sometimes I I buy a mecf flurry late in
[11:20] the night for a girlfriend or something
[11:22] like that so I I I don't go off to
[11:24] McDonald's but sometimes I do as like a
[11:26] small treat uh and I was and there was
[11:30] someone ordering I was like what that's
[11:31] now four and I hear that more and more
[11:34] like I was last time in a train uh and
[11:37] there was like two older men uh sitting
[11:40] like I think around 60 or 70 years old
[11:43] and they were basically discussing how
[11:45] everything got more expensive like for
[11:48] two hours straight I was I was like I
[11:51] was really close to for like just like
[11:54] putting a camera there because it was so
[11:56] lovely that talk and I think it would be
[11:58] a hit on on the internet to just put
[12:01] that out there uh but I feel like
[12:04] inflation the problem is getting more
[12:06] and more mainstream but at the same time
[12:09] I also see that the the level of pain
[12:13] didn't hit a a a an an really incredible
[12:18] point where people are like oh what do I
[12:21] have to like that what do I have to do
[12:23] can I go to bitcoin what what Solutions
[12:25] can I get and then I look at countries
[12:28] where for example turkey or
[12:31] Argentina there the Bitcoin adoption is
[12:34] also not 50% or 70% it's higher than in
[12:37] in other countries and people are more
[12:39] aware and more open to Solutions but
[12:41] they go more towards like a US dollar
[12:44] solution or other stronger fear currency
[12:46] Solutions so like it's it's interesting
[12:48] for me that that inflation top I feel
[12:51] like we we need inflation in every
[12:52] currency and it has to be really bad and
[12:55] people have to suffer a lot before we we
[12:58] get the mainstream to to adopt Bitcoin
[13:00] is that pain point so important in our
[13:04] education yeah
[13:06] so the analogy I like to draw is if
[13:09] somebody's being abused in a
[13:11] relationship and the scale of abuse like
[13:14] let's say zero is there is zero abuse
[13:16] it's the it's everybody everybody's
[13:18] loving they're respectful and then 10 is
[13:20] where your life is in danger and you're
[13:22] telling to tell this person to leave a
[13:24] relationship right if it's 9.5
[13:29] and they're almost dead they're still
[13:30] not going to leave the relationship they
[13:32] have to get to 10 before they will make
[13:36] that final leap and I feel like a lot of
[13:40] people are experiencing pain and we
[13:42] might be on the scale of suffering you
[13:44] know with from inflation maybe at a
[13:47] seven or eight at least in the US or
[13:49] even a five and a six depending on who
[13:51] you are and we are still many steps away
[13:54] from us waking him and going we need to
[13:57] do we can't this cannot continue right I
[14:00] think a lot of people are complaining
[14:01] because they're feeling pain I think the
[14:04] danger of us not doing good job with
[14:07] Bitcoin education is when they get to
[14:11] 10 that's when they're absolutely being
[14:14] led by emotion and they're very easily
[14:16] swayed so they're not necessarily going
[14:19] to pick the best option they're just
[14:22] going to pick the available option so if
[14:24] we're not in front of them already
[14:26] saying Bitcoin is the
[14:29] safest way or alternative to Fiat money
[14:34] then they're going to see crypto and go
[14:36] oh that's okay to they're going to see
[14:38] cbdc and go oh that's even better
[14:41] because that's secure the government is
[14:42] going to protect me obviously and um and
[14:45] so we like our job I think as Bitcoin
[14:48] Educators is we have to do we have to
[14:51] understand that this is a marketing
[14:53] process and if we are not in front of
[14:56] their eyeballs you know how they say you
[14:57] like what you're were saying before you
[14:59] have to be in front of them seven times
[15:00] before they buy something well that's if
[15:03] they see it favorably seven times
[15:06] Bitcoin probably six out of seven times
[15:09] is portray as a
[15:11] scam so that's not working in our favor
[15:15] so if they get to 10 and what they see
[15:18] is cbdc that's what they're going to go
[15:21] for and so also the the idea of
[15:24] inflation there's so much mixed um ideas
[15:29] that are presented to them with a lot of
[15:31] money behind them that inflation is
[15:33] being caused by something other the
[15:37] money printing it is the politician is
[15:39] his policy it is the corporations are
[15:41] being greedy um there everybody else's
[15:44] fault except the fact that money is
[15:46] being printed right
[15:49] so that's the challenge that we have we
[15:53] have to lay the groundwork then we also
[15:55] have to be the first thing they see you
[15:57] know in a positive light
[15:59] so that they can choose that when
[16:01] they're at the heighten like 10 you know
[16:04] like I have to make a difference I have
[16:06] to make a different choice now and if
[16:08] we're not right in front of them when
[16:10] they are in that emotional moment
[16:12] they're going to choose something else
[16:14] oh that's why you also say that we have
[16:17] to make Bitcoin more family friendly I
[16:20] think you wrote even an article around
[16:21] that and to get them as as early as as
[16:26] as possible uh to get like a a f
[16:28] favorable or like a good Association to
[16:31] bitcoin I that's really I love that a
[16:34] lot what you're doing yeah and the other
[16:36] thing is also I have like there are
[16:38] three audiences I'm trying to reach with
[16:40] my pre my uh early reader Series right
[16:42] so you have I'm I don't talk about money
[16:45] and I don't talk about Bitcoin
[16:47] specifically in the book so my goal is
[16:50] to be able to to share this book with
[16:52] any parent who wants to read a nice cute
[16:55] little sweet story with their kid right
[16:57] so they're reading the the story to the
[16:59] kid so the kid were're we're putting
[17:01] brick crumbs in front of the kit but the
[17:03] mom is reading it and she's gathering
[17:06] information too so she's seeing that if
[17:10] her child saved up for something like we
[17:12] used to have to do if you on a bike you
[17:14] saved up for a bike if you want it you
[17:16] know like a computer Playboy thingamajig
[17:19] um you save up for it but if they save
[17:21] up they have integrity they're not
[17:23] swiping it on your credit card they said
[17:26] we are going to work toward this goal
[17:29] and the goal keeps moving that pain the
[17:32] mom is going to feel on behalf of the
[17:34] child so in that way we're raising
[17:38] awareness you know of the issues in
[17:40] front of the mom as well and also how
[17:42] many grandparents are involved in
[17:44] reading stories to their children their
[17:46] grandchildren a lot right so we're also
[17:49] indirectly influencing the grandparents
[17:51] because they remember a day when they
[17:54] saved up for a bike the money they saved
[17:56] up that was their goal was enough to go
[17:59] to the store and buy the bike but it's
[18:01] not that way now you don't know how much
[18:03] the bike would be by the time you go to
[18:04] the store
[18:05] today it's also interesting uh the the
[18:09] mom has a really Central role in Orange
[18:12] pilling the Next Generation because um
[18:16] usually uh the mom like I like 25 I have
[18:20] no experience and I have no clue at all
[18:22] but from my subjective feeling I feel
[18:24] like the mom has a better connection
[18:26] usually with the kids uh and uh I feel
[18:29] like that could be a really crucial role
[18:31] in in in educating the New Generation Um
[18:35] and then you look at the Bitcoin events
[18:38] they're like 90% guys uh and and there
[18:42] like maybe 10% women uh it's like I have
[18:45] on five to 10% of my audience is is
[18:47] women it depends on which month uh funny
[18:50] enough it it's volatile quite quite
[18:53] quite uh massively uh then I think the
[18:56] big I mentioned that so many times natal
[18:58] PR is uh the probably the biggest female
[19:02] Bitcoin podcaster in the scene with the
[19:05] biggest audience audience at least and
[19:07] she posted something with 20% of of
[19:09] female audience uh which is also not too
[19:11] high um I think you wrote an article
[19:14] around the topic actually with um what
[19:17] was it how to approach uh uh how to have
[19:20] a different approach to bitcoin
[19:21] education for women something like that
[19:23] what's your thought around that yes so
[19:26] women well so I think in the article I
[19:28] said number one you have to anger Mama
[19:30] Bear you you it's it's all about the
[19:35] kids when I when my kids were little if
[19:38] you came to me and try to tell me
[19:39] anything that had nothing directly
[19:41] related to the well-being of my children
[19:44] I am sorry I don't have time for you
[19:46] because my days are busy my 24 hours a
[19:50] day you know I could be dealing with a
[19:52] sick child and another child who is
[19:54] having trouble with math and another
[19:56] child who's having trouble with her
[19:58] friends
[19:59] my emotional bandwidth is like this big
[20:03] you know I'm and also I homeschool so so
[20:06] that that made my job like 247 literally
[20:10] you know
[20:11] 365 and um and if you said anything to
[20:14] me that wasn't directly related to the
[20:16] well-being of my kids just don't even
[20:17] talk to me I don't have time for you and
[20:20] that's just that's just practicality
[20:23] that's just I have 24 hours in a day
[20:25] right so if we're trying to reach moms
[20:28] and we're saying hey go listen to this
[20:30] podcast that's 2 hours
[20:32] long unless she is really realizing that
[20:36] there is a problem like what I was
[20:37] saying about the Journey of a customer
[20:39] for an idea unless you're at a 10
[20:42] they're not going to give you the time
[20:43] of day but if you drop little
[20:46] breadcrumbs they can pick it up you know
[20:49] and which is why even okay I'll just
[20:52] give you another personal example is
[20:54] when my kids were little I was very
[20:57] intentional about teach teaching them
[20:59] about economics because scottt and I we
[21:01] both have an MBA and we both felt that
[21:04] we grew up not really understanding how
[21:06] money worked even through the MBA
[21:09] program we didn't feel like we got the
[21:10] education that we really needed to
[21:12] understand how the system works so we
[21:15] were really intentional and only for
[21:17] that reason did I go into the economics
[21:20] books and we actually even created a
[21:23] game to teach economics to our kids um
[21:26] but if you go to any of my friends the
[21:28] homeschooling moms and you said hey
[21:32] don't you think that it would be really
[21:34] important for your child's future to
[21:35] teach them about money they're going to
[21:37] say yes however here's a priority list
[21:41] of their daily to-dos right you have of
[21:43] course you Fe your children you clothe
[21:46] them you get them different places and
[21:48] then you have the traditional three Rs
[21:50] you have the Reading Writing arithmetics
[21:53] then you have if you're a Christian it's
[21:54] going to be religion and then you're
[21:56] going to have science obviously and you
[21:58] have everything else and then money is
[22:02] right on the bottom because these are
[22:05] all priority party number one I guess
[22:09] these are all like this so nobody's
[22:12] going to say money is not important but
[22:14] they don't have the bandwidth and if we
[22:16] say hey let me tell you about the
[22:17] history of money like you know some
[22:19] people some people think in order to
[22:21] make information buy siiz we just take a
[22:24] textbook and you just chop it into short
[22:26] chapters and that's by size information
[22:29] and and that's the way you're going to
[22:30] reach these busy people and I'm
[22:34] specifically talking about busy moms so
[22:36] if you told me hey instead of reading a
[22:39] book how about reading a chapter on
[22:41] money I'm still going to say no thanks I
[22:45] why would I want to read about the
[22:47] history of money it's irrelevant to my
[22:48] kid who has a tooth AE it's irrelevant
[22:50] to my kid who is struggling with the
[22:53] algebra you know but if you say hey
[22:55] let's let me tell you about a story and
[22:57] it's a story that you can enjoy with
[22:59] your family as a whole everybody's
[23:01] benefiting from that time and the BREC
[23:04] is there they'll pick it up because
[23:07] we're all intelligent human beings we
[23:08] pick it up the kids will pick it up and
[23:11] it will build it's a compound effect so
[23:14] in that way I feel like you we just have
[23:16] to be aware of our audience women have a
[23:19] different emotional priority it is not
[23:22] just do they have time or not do they
[23:24] have time yes they might choose to
[23:26] scroll on their phone because that's the
[23:27] only way they can turn everything off
[23:29] because you're thinking all the time
[23:31] you're if you think about women we have
[23:33] in a computer we have a lot of windows
[23:35] open at the same time so when we're
[23:38] focused on even scrolling on Instagram
[23:41] and looking at puppy videos or something
[23:44] that's our way of of just ignoring all
[23:46] these open windows for that moment of
[23:49] time why would we think that they would
[23:52] care about reading a paragraph about
[23:55] money they're not because that's more
[23:57] thinking and I again there it's about
[24:00] emotional bandwidth and knowing your
[24:02] audience it's so important uh to get
[24:04] there really really cool how you
[24:06] describe it um you also mentioned
[24:08] homeschooling and I feel like
[24:09] homeschooling in Bitcoin is such an such
[24:12] a topic that just sticks together like I
[24:15] feel like everyone in in Bitcoin is
[24:17] either trying to or homeschool uh or is
[24:21] already homeschooling at least those who
[24:23] have the possibilities like you also
[24:25] need the the time and the resources to
[24:27] do do that uh you you're homeschooling
[24:30] uh right and and you're also big on
[24:32] homeschooling I homeschooled my kids are
[24:35] I'm all done that's the only reason I'm
[24:37] working in the Bitcoin space now if if
[24:39] they weren't done that you would not be
[24:40] seeing
[24:41] me that's that's that's they are my
[24:43] priority
[24:45] always how how is homeschooling uh going
[24:49] I think I was not homeschooled in
[24:50] Austria I don't know anyone uh that
[24:53] homeschools their kids but everyone that
[24:55] I speak to online and is a bitcoiner and
[24:58] in highest kids they seemingly all
[25:01] homeschool why is homeschooling the
[25:03] better
[25:04] way oh there that's a that's a very big
[25:07] topic um I'll give you my personal
[25:10] reason for why I decided to homeschool
[25:12] my kids pre- Bitcoin days because I I
[25:14] didn't get into Bitcoin until the tail
[25:17] end of my homeschooling days so the
[25:19] reason I started it was um I did okay
[25:24] several reasons one I don't want my kids
[25:27] graded while they're learning I think
[25:30] that's
[25:31] counterproductive when they are learning
[25:33] they should be making mistakes and if
[25:35] we're grading them then you're really
[25:38] punishing them I don't care what people
[25:40] say about feedback if you're keeping
[25:43] that grade and then averaging it out at
[25:46] the end of the school year and the
[25:48] student is labeled as an a student B
[25:50] student or C student it is a punitive
[25:53] feedback so I don't believe in grading
[25:55] when they're learning if you're trying
[25:57] to check if they have mastered something
[26:00] then you grade so that's one number two
[26:02] I don't believe in all subjects
[26:05] advancing at the same speed I think some
[26:08] kids are naturally inclined to
[26:10] understand arithmetics some kids are
[26:12] naturally inclined to understand uh
[26:15] language arts some in you know like
[26:18] expressive art some in athletic doesn't
[26:20] matter but I don't believe that all
[26:22] these different areas of knowledge need
[26:25] to happen in the same trajectory and the
[26:27] same time time and so if I have a child
[26:30] who's like a very Advanced reader I
[26:33] don't and she's you know technically
[26:35] fourth grade age or whatever I don't
[26:37] want to keep her reading at fourth grade
[26:40] and I think reading by gr age
[26:43] is it's so ridiculous anyway because I
[26:47] think kids will pick up what they can
[26:49] pick up if you speak to them normally if
[26:51] you use expressive and beautiful
[26:53] language they will pick up what they can
[26:54] pick up and that will build use as a
[26:57] teacher if you assume that you can they
[26:59] can only understand sentences that are
[27:02] less than 10 words long then you rob
[27:05] them the opportunity to learn better you
[27:07] know because you have drawn a box around
[27:11] where they can grow so anyway I don't
[27:14] believe in unilateral advancement
[27:17] progress I guess that's my own
[27:19] word um the other thing is
[27:22] also I really wanted um if a child is
[27:27] struggling in one particular area
[27:30] for him to not advance until that that
[27:35] particular area has been mastered so if
[27:38] you in the in a classroom situation if
[27:42] you pass a test and let's say your the
[27:45] passing grade is 65 and you get 66 and
[27:48] you pass that gap between 66 and 100
[27:53] that's going to prevent you from being
[27:55] successful in the next level of let's
[27:57] say arithmetic right because it's a you
[28:00] build up on the previous knowledge and
[28:02] you slowly Advance forward if you have
[28:05] trouble with addition and you pass it
[28:08] you barely scrap by you pass it you go
[28:10] to
[28:11] multiplication you're going to suffer a
[28:14] lot because your foundation wasn't built
[28:16] right but they have to continually move
[28:18] you forward but in homeschooling you
[28:19] have the option to say hey if you have a
[28:21] master addition let's try something else
[28:24] maybe it's a different approach maybe
[28:26] it's different maybe we need to add
[28:27] tactiles s maybe you need to be jumping
[28:29] up and down so you're a kinetic learner
[28:31] and so maybe you need to sa the addition
[28:34] table by by jumping on a trampoline I
[28:36] don't know um maybe you need to be
[28:38] running and plays but you don't go
[28:41] forward until you have mastered this so
[28:43] that at the next level you have all the
[28:45] tools that you need to build on your
[28:48] knowledge base so when you're
[28:50] homeschooling you have the freedom to do
[28:51] that in a classroom situation when the
[28:54] teacher has to um you know teach their
[28:58] kids at a time they can't possibly do
[29:00] that so you just keep getting moved
[29:02] forward and if the knowledge Gap
[29:04] continues to widen you're going to have
[29:07] a child who eventually really really
[29:09] struggles and then the thing is also you
[29:12] get labeled so quickly in a school
[29:14] system you're labeled by your grade
[29:17] you're labeled by the classes you take
[29:19] you're labeled by maybe the clothes you
[29:21] wear the labels distract you from the
[29:24] actual learning process so when you're
[29:27] homeschooling even if that's the only um
[29:30] advantage that you see is the lack of
[29:33] labeling your child while he is just
[29:36] trying to figure out who he is and you
[29:38] know what this life is about and how to
[29:40] be successful that right there just that
[29:42] one little difference I think would make
[29:45] the experience worth it if you watch or
[29:47] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[29:50] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[29:53] and now the most important step is to
[29:55] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[29:58] hardware wallet my personal
[30:00] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:02] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[30:04] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[30:06] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[30:09] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[30:49] digital footprint in general is secure
[30:52] they are the experts in cyber security
[30:55] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[30:58] secure sovereign individual in general
[31:02] and last but not least I have something
[31:04] completely new for you guys I partnered
[31:07] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[31:11] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:13] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:16] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:19] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[31:22] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:25] there and show that you are a Bitcoin
[31:28] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[31:31] make sure to check out the link in the
[31:33] description for this amazing coin
[31:35] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[31:38] amazing I love them so much it was
[31:40] really hard for me to pick the one that
[31:42] I want to have because there are a lot
[31:44] of great options I went with the new
[31:47] transparency Edition they're all limited
[31:50] so grab yours those will not be
[31:52] available for a long time but there will
[31:54] come new models and new amazing designs
[31:57] along the way the labels one is a big
[31:59] one I feel like in in Austria I don't
[32:01] know if it's around the world also like
[32:03] that but in Austria there are like
[32:05] different within a class different uh
[32:08] stages so if you're in stage one you are
[32:11] in the high class and and if you're in
[32:14] stage three you are struggling with with
[32:15] that topic and they have different tests
[32:18] for different stages so you're not even
[32:20] in like you in in a separate class but
[32:23] in that class there's a further division
[32:25] uh like a classes like that that's
[32:27] that's so ridiculous right now to me uh
[32:30] but back then as a child it was normal
[32:33] it was like you accepted it you didn't
[32:35] question it no parent questioned that
[32:37] like at least not to my knowledge uh and
[32:40] and right now I'm like they they put the
[32:42] kids like in different uh in different
[32:45] classes that they divided like those
[32:47] labels they can really hunt you down
[32:49] like I think that's that that does
[32:51] something to to a kid and it it's it's
[32:54] not good for sure like I 100% agree with
[32:57] you here it's it's it's a hard one uh
[33:00] yeah and whatever they get labeled when
[33:02] they're in first grade um it it you
[33:05] carry that with you unless you're very
[33:07] very very intentional later on life to
[33:09] counteract that it's sitting in the back
[33:12] of your mind always and I read uh it was
[33:14] a book called The outliers and they were
[33:17] talking about how um in when you go into
[33:20] a gray system you have kids coming in
[33:23] with different birthdays right but if
[33:24] they fall in the same calendar year they
[33:27] go into to the same school year so for
[33:30] example when you're when you're entering
[33:33] let's say
[33:34] kindergarten um so the age range can be
[33:38] five to six so somebody's born in
[33:40] January 1st versus somebody's born
[33:42] December 31st they all go in as
[33:45] kindergarteners now we all know when the
[33:47] kids are young one year makes a huge
[33:50] difference in their ability to do things
[33:53] so you're all entering kindergarten but
[33:55] a child could be almost a year older
[33:58] than another child so let's say the
[34:00] child who's lucky enough to be born
[34:03] January 1st goes and can kindergarten
[34:06] and he just excels at everything because
[34:09] they have to accommodate for the average
[34:10] right so the one that's born December 30
[34:13] first now is looking kind of like oh
[34:16] he's uh maybe a little slow you know
[34:19] maybe he's a little behind and then kids
[34:22] can feel that they know they go into
[34:25] they go into first grade again the
[34:26] January 1 child is going to be able to
[34:28] do a lot more stuff than the December
[34:31] 31st child right and then if you think
[34:34] about the accumulating effect of that
[34:36] going through the schools if the younger
[34:39] child is lucky enough to have a lot of
[34:41] support at home or just is naturally
[34:43] incline that subject then they might be
[34:45] okay but just think about the
[34:46] disadvantage you put these kids in even
[34:49] just by their birthday and by their
[34:51] physical
[34:52] development and you can avoid that with
[34:54] homeschooling I love that a lot yeah
[34:56] homeschooling is
[34:58] uh I think it's further down the line
[35:00] for me hopefully a few few few more
[35:03] years uh but it's something that I
[35:06] highly see now and if and even look it
[35:08] up in Austria I think it's possible uh I
[35:11] I don't know anyone that's why I'm not
[35:13] sure but uh what I looked up it's
[35:15] possible Germany I know it's not
[35:16] possible as far as I know uh but yeah
[35:20] why did you uh it's a question that I
[35:21] should have asked way earlier but why
[35:23] did you uh got Bitcoin why what made it
[35:26] click for you what what what was the
[35:28] pain point or the the advantage trigger
[35:30] point for for
[35:31] you okay at first I have to say um my
[35:35] husband dragged me into it against my
[35:39] will uh it like I said we came across
[35:43] Bitcoin in in in a more a serious way at
[35:47] the tail end of my homeschooling career
[35:49] with my kids and at the time I was
[35:51] graduating four kids at a time because
[35:53] we did the one school room setup and so
[35:56] when my old this started High School my
[35:58] youngest just kind of just did what she
[36:00] did and so he he was many years more
[36:03] advanced um so I was trying to graduate
[36:05] them and in the US the college
[36:07] application process for a homeschooling
[36:10] family is very very involved because
[36:12] they don't believe anything you say as a
[36:14] parent they want third party
[36:16] acknowledgement for everything and so I
[36:19] was instead of saying here's the trans
[36:22] transcript of the classes they took uh
[36:25] you I had to provide the curriculum I
[36:27] had to provide their assignments I have
[36:28] to provide information on how I graded
[36:31] it was this it's like this whole giant
[36:33] book that I had to submit to the college
[36:35] uh admission office for each child and
[36:38] so it was a very very busy time for me
[36:40] and that was around the same time that
[36:42] Scott uh was starting to hear more and
[36:44] more podcasters that he was listening to
[36:46] talk about Bitcoin so he came to me one
[36:49] day and he said hey you know this
[36:50] Bitcoin thing I think I think it's real
[36:53] and we should look into it for the sake
[36:55] of our kids we should understand it and
[36:58] that would he he knows my trigger words
[37:01] right for the sake of the kids cuz if he
[37:03] didn't say that just like get out of
[37:04] here I don't have
[37:06] time um but he said for the sake of the
[37:09] kids I'm like and then he said um he
[37:12] said here's a book it's the Bitcoin
[37:14] standard which is really thick as you
[37:15] know um here are you know 10 two hour
[37:18] long podcast you should listen to about
[37:20] you know the history of money and the
[37:22] development of money and Bitcoin and
[37:24] stuff um here's some articles they're
[37:27] all all very long for whatever reason
[37:29] and I here's some videos and I literally
[37:31] just would look at them and go you know
[37:33] what I just don't have the mental
[37:34] bandwidth for this why are you bugging
[37:35] me can you just leave me alone and he
[37:38] kept just going after he's like you need
[37:40] to we need to understand this as a
[37:43] family the kids need to understand this
[37:45] this is the development of the financial
[37:48] technology and finally he uh he just
[37:51] said okay let me just try to explain it
[37:52] to you on the table so he took some maun
[37:55] tiles and some playing cards and he just
[37:57] marked up stuff and he was trying to
[37:58] demonstrate the blockchain transaction
[38:01] he was trying to explain shot 256 how
[38:03] the math goes Only One Direction on the
[38:05] other direction
[38:06] Etc and he was like don't you understand
[38:09] now it is so Crystal Clear and I
[38:12] said no like so he continued to work on
[38:17] that um it took two years for him to
[38:19] convince me to read the first book in
[38:21] bigco in the meantime he created the
[38:24] game hotle up uh which is the flagship
[38:27] game that we have for f free market kids
[38:29] but anyway it wasn't until I was
[38:31] absolutely convinced that digital
[38:33] currency could be a thing an actual
[38:36] legitimate thing that might replace the
[38:40] dollar because you cannot copy it that I
[38:43] was like fine give me one of your did
[38:46] your um Bitcoin books I will read one
[38:48] book and I I listened to it on Audible
[38:52] is um Bitcoin hard money you can f with
[38:54] by Jason Williams and I listened to on
[38:56] 2X because I was like that's how much
[38:58] time I'm giving you I think the book is
[39:00] like five hours and I was like I will
[39:01] give you two and a half hours and from
[39:04] the first chapter I like I just felt
[39:08] like my eyes opened and the
[39:11] reason getting back to your question
[39:13] about the sort of the journey that I was
[39:16] already on to be ready to listen to to
[39:20] the explanation was um so Scott and I
[39:23] both graduated from from Yale we both
[39:26] have an NBA degree and I chose to stay
[39:29] home I was supposed to go into
[39:30] Investment Banking and I held my baby
[39:32] and I'm like no I don't want somebody
[39:33] else raising my child I want to be the
[39:35] one to be the primary caretaker I care
[39:38] about having a really good relationship
[39:40] with her so I chose to stay home and
[39:43] Scott and I both had huge student loans
[39:46] and I told him like you're it you're
[39:48] going to have to take on both student
[39:50] loans and pay it down and it's as big as
[39:51] a mortgage I mean it is
[39:54] huge and um so we have four really close
[39:58] and he was working a job but even then I
[40:02] think it was 2 it was 2001 when the
[40:05] first wave started to hit and his um his
[40:08] job offer was pulled right out of
[40:10] business school it was pulled and we're
[40:11] like what is happening we thought that
[40:13] if we worked really hard we got into
[40:15] good schools we got good grades we got a
[40:17] good internship our future was going to
[40:19] be
[40:20] set but it so his job off fur was pulled
[40:23] in 2001 and we started looking at each
[40:25] other like what is going on in 20 8 um
[40:28] the first financial crisis the major
[40:30] major financial crisis happened and we
[40:32] lived in a town and he worked for a
[40:35] company where they laid off 40,000
[40:38] people in the same area and we were one
[40:42] of them and it were like and you know we
[40:44] have like the Wall Street protest and
[40:46] and um a lot of news articles coming out
[40:49] saying opposite things and I couldn't
[40:51] make sense of it we both desperately
[40:54] wanted to understand why it was
[40:56] happening so we could explain it to our
[40:59] kids like I said before I was very
[41:00] intentional about teaching them about
[41:02] economics so they can make life choices
[41:04] that are informed and not based on sound
[41:07] bites and you know like propaganda or
[41:09] whatever I wanted them to be
[41:11] intellectually informed on why things
[41:14] happen why things are the way they are
[41:17] but I couldn't figure it out in 2008 and
[41:20] at that time we have four little kids
[41:22] and Scott was laid off and then again it
[41:25] happened if I think it was like 2011
[41:28] and so when I so so that was like I was
[41:32] already struggling with that idea number
[41:34] one the fact that we were struggle so
[41:35] much because we were trying to pay down
[41:37] two student loans and I chose to stay
[41:39] home which was a huge controversy with
[41:42] our
[41:43] family because you know the expectation
[41:45] is you get a good education you work you
[41:48] know you you put your kids in child care
[41:51] and you work and you get you know Roi
[41:54] from your investment in your education
[41:56] but
[41:57] but just looking back the the last you
[42:00] know 25 years of our marriage and
[42:03] everything that we've gone through since
[42:04] we graduated from the business
[42:06] school looking at the money system
[42:09] through the lens of bitcoiners finally
[42:11] explained why all those things were
[42:13] happening and we were already frustrated
[42:16] because we couldn't figure out the right
[42:18] way to explain it to our kids to give
[42:21] them a better chance for a bright future
[42:22] etc etc and um and so that that was BAS
[42:27] basically I think life experiences
[42:28] prepped me for that message because I
[42:30] was already confused and looking for
[42:32] answers and I didn't have the right
[42:34] framework until we zoomed way back out
[42:37] because I was still looking at like the
[42:40] financial institution in terms of you
[42:43] know jobs and corporations and you know
[42:46] is it is it our tax policy is it is it
[42:49] just um people like corporations are um
[42:53] just cold and All About Numbers like I
[42:55] was my eyes were here but it wasn't
[42:57] until I went into the Bitcoin space
[42:59] where I was just like zoomed down like
[43:01] oh I understand now and then I just got
[43:05] mad I just got mad and I it I had to
[43:09] stop my book several times but I was
[43:13] straight down the rabbit hole and I was
[43:15] like everybody everybody needs to
[43:18] understand this everybody needs to
[43:20] understand this but we have to be so
[43:22] strategic because if you came to me even
[43:25] 10 years ago and tried to tell tell me
[43:27] about Bitcoin I would not have listened
[43:28] to you it's it's it's it's very true a
[43:31] really cool story by the way um how how
[43:33] many Bitcoin books did you now read from
[43:36] from the first one onwards how deep was
[43:38] the rabbit hole a lot a lot not as many
[43:41] as Scott like every Bitcoin book that
[43:43] comes out we have a copy of and
[43:46] he he reads all of them he listens to
[43:49] every podcast I still feel like there
[43:53] there's more to life that I'm interested
[43:55] in and want to continue learning about
[43:56] so my sole focus with our business is
[44:00] Bitcoin but but we live in this physical
[44:04] existence right so like I think you said
[44:07] you mentioned that um in one of the
[44:09] previous podcasts you did with other
[44:10] guest like I think it was the one with
[44:12] teren uh you were talking about politics
[44:14] because Bitcoin is a really cool tool
[44:18] it's a cool idea and it would be great
[44:22] when we get to the point where Bitcoin
[44:24] is the new money standard but we live in
[44:27] this moment and there is still a gap
[44:30] between where we are and where we all
[44:32] hope we're going to get to so life is
[44:36] very big life still involves a lot more
[44:38] than just money Concepts you know and so
[44:42] yeah I have read a lot of books but I I
[44:45] definitely don't Deep dive the way that
[44:47] Scott does it's interesting also I me I
[44:51] just realized that like I think a month
[44:53] ago or one and a half months ago
[44:55] something like that where I have a
[44:57] Bitcoin podcast and just imagine I would
[44:59] have not a Bitcoin podcast but like a
[45:01] stock podcast on a stock podcast you
[45:04] probably just talk about stocks and how
[45:06] to pick like good management teams and
[45:08] and and stuff like that and what a p
[45:10] ratio is and all those things um and
[45:13] then now I have a Bitcoin podcast I did
[45:16] for example with with Lisa Huff a
[45:18] complete episode just around parenting
[45:21] like there was like only that topic we
[45:24] talked like we had we probably name
[45:26] dropped Bitcoin like five times in that
[45:28] podcast in like one and a half hours uh
[45:31] so Bitcoin is that weird Financial topic
[45:34] where you can talk about parenting and
[45:36] homeschooling and diet and uh carnivore
[45:40] versus vegan and all those interesting
[45:42] topics that come from a sound mind and
[45:47] then all of the sudden you can go
[45:48] through all this topics and the fewers
[45:50] actually like that like the when I make
[45:53] an episode completely off topic it's not
[45:56] like only like 1% listens to that no
[45:59] like they they like it they love it they
[46:02] see the the the changeing it the mix in
[46:04] it I think the other side is actually
[46:07] true like if if I only have on topic
[46:09] hardcore Bitcoin topics I think people
[46:11] would be bored with that so I I I love
[46:14] getting in like homeschooling in in in
[46:17] in an episode or if even make a whole
[46:19] episode around feat food and what's
[46:21] wrong with our food supply it is a
[46:23] little bit of a Bitcoin topic but when
[46:25] we honest it's not really really a
[46:27] Bitcoin topic it's it's about our food
[46:29] system and why it's it's bad so there's
[46:32] a that's really interesting how we can
[46:34] go with Bitcoin in so many different
[46:36] topics and we don't only have to talk
[46:39] about money right yeah exactly exactly
[46:43] really cool yeah perfect then uh before
[46:45] we get to the end routine um we
[46:47] mentioned it a little bit free markets
[46:49] kits orange headers Super K Avengers um
[46:53] how does this all fit together what are
[46:54] you doing in in Bitcoin and and what is
[46:57] that okay so free market kits is um the
[47:01] company that Scott and I created to use
[47:04] board games to teach money Concepts
[47:07] without using lectures so I always I
[47:10] always prefer that um that lessons are
[47:14] derived from experience because that's
[47:17] how it's most meaningful to the student
[47:20] right so the first game that we created
[47:23] for for Maran kids actually was pre-
[47:25] coiner days we were just finding a we
[47:28] were looking for a way to teach economic
[47:30] principles how price moves with changes
[47:33] in supply and demand to our kids without
[47:36] just using a video lecture and then quiz
[47:40] sheets because that's if you look um I
[47:45] don't know about today but back then um
[47:47] if you're teaching economics it's
[47:49] immediately books longan books lectures
[47:53] and then quizzing the kids and then you
[47:54] go into graphs and you do a equations
[47:57] and calculations which is great for
[48:00] academics but for the purpose that I had
[48:03] in mind at the time when we developed
[48:05] this was when Trump was going through
[48:07] his first election run and I remember
[48:10] him saying uh making a statement that he
[48:13] was going to increase tariffs on Chinese
[48:15] Imports because of the the you know the
[48:18] the trade
[48:19] imbalance um and I I remember seeing
[48:24] these news outlets go on college
[48:27] campuses asking students what they
[48:29] thought about that and from the answers
[48:32] that the students gave it was ample
[48:34] clear they had no clue how that one
[48:37] policy would affect them personally they
[48:39] it was just and then another one it was
[48:40] like What if
[48:43] um what if all student debts were were
[48:46] uh were thrown out like it just erased
[48:50] and of course all the students on the
[48:52] college campuses are be like that's
[48:53] great of course college should be free
[48:56] well they don't realize is nothing is
[48:58] free and there's always a cost and guess
[49:01] who's going to pay for
[49:03] it they don't realize who's going to
[49:06] actually pay for it they just think it's
[49:07] free the government is going to pay for
[49:09] it the government has no money and so so
[49:13] we wanted to we wanted our kids to be
[49:16] informed during the election process
[49:18] listening to all these sound bites so we
[49:21] created a negotiation game
[49:24] where the players would
[49:28] sorry would um negotiate price depending
[49:31] on how many suppliers and well how many
[49:35] buyers and sellers were in the
[49:36] negotiation so for example if I'm if
[49:39] it's my turn in the game and I say I'm
[49:41] looking to buy uh gravity boots is
[49:44] anybody selling gravity boots well if
[49:46] one person's selling that's a one-on-one
[49:48] negotiation the price is probably going
[49:50] to sit somewhere in the middle of his my
[49:52] cost and his willingness to pay but
[49:57] if you have more people selling very
[49:59] very quickly you figure out that the
[50:01] price will be bit lower versus if you
[50:05] have one seller and multiple buyers you
[50:08] can through experience know that the
[50:11] price will be bit up higher you don't
[50:13] need to draw a chart you know with a
[50:15] supply demand curve and move it up the
[50:17] curve and calculate all the areas
[50:19] underneath the curve like none of us
[50:21] relevant they just need to understand
[50:23] okay here that's how prices determine
[50:26] what changes with supply and demand but
[50:28] then if we draw a market cart and it
[50:29] says well what if there's a increased
[50:32] tariff on imports from the country where
[50:36] you're sourcing your gravity boots well
[50:38] suddenly that changes your incentive
[50:40] when you're communicating the sales
[50:43] price right as a seller so through
[50:46] practice in the game itself the kids
[50:48] learn the lessons and afterwards they
[50:50] can answer confidently this is what
[50:52] happens versus if you give them a
[50:54] lecture and draw graphs they're going to
[50:55] be like uh they might memorize your
[50:58] answers the to the questions but they
[51:01] don't necessarily embody the knowledge
[51:04] so that's the first game we came up with
[51:07] is that the best you can do is the is
[51:08] the name of the game and the hollow up
[51:10] is the one that Scott created during the
[51:11] two years when he was trying to convince
[51:13] me to go down the rabbit hole with him
[51:15] so um it just covers the fundamentals of
[51:17] the Bitcoin uh the Bitcoin ecosystem so
[51:21] 21 million Bitcoin ever uh we go through
[51:24] having events we have difficult dial
[51:27] that uh adjusts the difficulty number
[51:29] according to the algorithm um we put
[51:33] together transactions we earn block
[51:35] rewards and we have the hot and cold
[51:37] wallet and you can steal from the hot
[51:39] but you can't steal from the cold that
[51:40] kind of stuff so very basic things you
[51:42] can play a game and not give any lecture
[51:46] about Bitcoin whatsoever and afterwards
[51:48] if you ask the players about questions
[51:50] about those key ideas that we all
[51:52] bitcoiners see as the most valuable
[51:55] aspect of Bitcoin they can answer it for
[51:57] you they know just through experience
[51:59] and that's how you always want to do is
[52:01] fun is number one lesson is number two
[52:03] that's IC see on the cake um then
[52:05] Channel up is the next one that he
[52:07] created it explains liquidity Management
[52:10] on the second layer because when we
[52:12] started listening to more and more
[52:14] people talk about the importance of
[52:16] having a second layer and you know
[52:18] smaller transactions faster transaction
[52:20] that cheaper transactions um this this
[52:23] started like a year and a half ago was
[52:25] when it started to be like a the
[52:26] discussion of every Bitcoin Meetup we
[52:28] ever went to and we travel quite a bit
[52:30] up and down the east coast of uh the
[52:31] United States um my understanding of the
[52:35] lightning layer was very fuzzy I didn't
[52:37] understand why they kept talking about
[52:38] the challenge of inbound outbound
[52:40] liquidity management because I'm like if
[52:42] it's in the channel it's in the channel
[52:44] what is the problem with you know which
[52:46] direction is going but if you play
[52:48] Channel up even one time it becomes
[52:50] crystal clear it is so visual um I don't
[52:54] think anybody can walk away from playing
[52:56] Channel and not
[52:57] say I understand the second layer is so
[53:00] much better so that's Channel up and a
[53:02] bib 39 is just a fun party game you can
[53:06] use it to explain entropy um you know
[53:09] the how we can use 12 wordss to secure
[53:12] our our cold wallets but you don't have
[53:15] to so we basically pulled out 74 animal
[53:18] words from the bib 39 list and then we
[53:21] have players sit around the table
[53:23] everybody has the same set of cards and
[53:24] you have one Oracle who pulls out three
[53:27] cards and put them in a certain order
[53:30] and it's up to the players to ask
[53:31] questions to eliminate choices and um
[53:34] figure out what those three cards are
[53:35] and then put them in the right order and
[53:37] it's a race against other players you
[53:38] want to be the first one to guess so
[53:41] we're demonstrating entropy but you
[53:43] don't have to go into it it's just a fun
[53:45] game and it's a way for you to talk
[53:47] about Bitcoin without lecturing people
[53:49] about Bitcoin and that's always the goal
[53:52] is if you and I don't know about your
[53:54] personal experience but when I go up to
[53:56] someone who's not bitcoiner who didn't
[53:59] come to our Bitcoin meet up and ready
[54:01] for some answers if you just go up to a
[54:03] random person hey can I talk to you
[54:04] about Bitcoin they're GNA be like why
[54:07] you know like it's a scam uh why you
[54:10] telling me I don't want to hear it and
[54:12] especially with our family and friends
[54:14] if you say hey can I tell you about
[54:15] Bitcoin they're going to be like no
[54:18] thanks or they're going to roll their
[54:19] eyes at you if they're polite they're
[54:21] just going to be silently rolling their
[54:22] eyes at you like oh my God here comes
[54:24] the lecture right but if you have a
[54:26] bridge to bring them into the space
[54:28] without the lecture without the in your-
[54:30] face let me tell you about Bitcoin um
[54:33] you just say hey come over let's have a
[54:36] game night I'll make some popcorn and
[54:38] we'll just have a lot of fun and if they
[54:40] are paying attention because they want
[54:41] to win the game they will ask you
[54:44] questions and when they ask and then you
[54:46] answer they will listen to you so it's
[54:49] it's it's kind of um I see it that way
[54:52] 100% because when when you go out and
[54:55] try to get people in Bitcoin you will
[54:58] fail like
[54:59] people people will not come to to
[55:03] bitcoin just because you say like you
[55:05] have to be really good in sales uh to
[55:08] convince someone on the spot uh to to
[55:11] get into Bitcoin and you have to know
[55:13] him good like maybe you are his hus her
[55:16] husband like maybe maybe there's some
[55:18] some deeper connection then you can do
[55:19] it as with you with over two years of of
[55:22] convincing um as I do it everyone knows
[55:27] that I'm this Bitcoin guy and I have a
[55:29] Bitcoin podcast and I work fully in
[55:31] Bitcoin so I don't have to introduce the
[55:34] topic because I'm my it's it's written
[55:36] on my head
[55:38] Bitcoin if I'm in a social situation if
[55:41] I'm in a family situation if there's
[55:43] someone new coming uh the family members
[55:46] explain to them oh I'm this Bitcoin guy
[55:50] and never have to bring it up everyone
[55:52] around me brings Bitcoin up because of
[55:54] my sheer existence in the room because
[55:56] I'm so vocal about Bitcoin uh especially
[56:00] online so which that means is every time
[56:04] Bitcoin comes up it's not coming up from
[56:05] me and I'm I'm 100% silent till someone
[56:09] speaks to me about it like I'm not
[56:11] bringing up Bitcoin because I know it's
[56:14] completely pointless I tried that
[56:16] strategy I'm not good in in that uh and
[56:18] so when when when I know there's Bitcoin
[56:23] uh debate I'm just waiting on and see
[56:25] what they're talking about it's also
[56:26] interesting to hear other people not in
[56:28] the Bitcoin bubble talk about Bitcoin
[56:30] because then you're like oh we're that
[56:32] early like people actually think that uh
[56:36] so uh it's it's interesting to hear that
[56:38] and then there's always this one point
[56:40] where it's like oh Robin you are working
[56:42] in Bitcoin how is that and then you ask
[56:45] then you have the attention uh and then
[56:47] you can speak about it and then then
[56:49] you're sounding competent then you're
[56:51] actually in a dialogue and then you
[56:53] actually maybe get someone to take the
[56:55] orange pill maybe that's the moment
[56:57] where someone is like ah never thought
[56:59] about that oh that that's an interesting
[57:01] point ah I will I will look it up today
[57:03] like oh can you uh give me some some
[57:06] Bitcoin books about that or can you
[57:08] recommend the podcast around that so
[57:10] like that that's always the the point
[57:12] how I try to do it and I think the the
[57:15] defensive part is really cool so that's
[57:18] why I really like um your way with the
[57:21] with the games and with the books not
[57:23] about Bitcoin it's also interesting when
[57:25] when someone asked me oh can you explain
[57:27] to me Bitcoin and I'm asking can you
[57:30] explain me
[57:31] inflation like that's always the first
[57:34] question that I asked because they don't
[57:36] know where they are in their Journey if
[57:38] if they say like yeah inflation uh it's
[57:42] it's it's uh it's it's bad that we have
[57:44] it it's it's a little bit high but a
[57:45] little bit inflation is good and uh yeah
[57:48] it's it's probably caused by the war
[57:50] then I know okay I have I I the first
[57:52] two hours I don't talk about Bitcoin I
[57:54] talk about something completely so I I
[57:56] love how how you how you view it sorry
[57:59] if I'm a from a little rant here um
[58:02] really really cool thank you so much um
[58:05] uh before we come to the end routine
[58:06] there's always one question to ask all
[58:08] my guests of my podcast what can we
[58:10] learn from you besides all the things
[58:12] that we already talked about gosh what
[58:15] can you learn from me
[58:17] um I I want to address the idea of the
[58:21] money mindset actually because I
[58:24] actually talked about this on um some of
[58:26] the other podcasts that I've been on
[58:29] which
[58:29] is I think as bitcoiners especially for
[58:32] bit Bitcoin Maxis we get so enthusiastic
[58:35] about the potential of Bitcoin what it
[58:37] can do to humanity and kind of reverse a
[58:40] lot of the bad stuff that have been
[58:42] developing over the last 100 years or so
[58:46] that we forget to realize that it is a
[58:49] tool and for people who are huddling for
[58:54] the purpose of the going to the Moon you
[58:56] know like we say that a lot Bitcoin is
[58:58] going to go to the Moon we just have to
[59:00] remember that the feeling the I don't
[59:03] want to say the feeling the mindset of
[59:05] money is the most important and so I
[59:09] know some people who talk about how if
[59:11] they have holes in their socks they're
[59:13] not going to buy new socks they're going
[59:14] to save the money and put it into
[59:16] Bitcoin and the question is at what
[59:19] point is it okay to spend Bitcoin
[59:22] because money is a mindset in that if
[59:25] you if if you're poor in Fiat you can
[59:28] also be poor huddling a lot of Bitcoin
[59:32] and life is
[59:34] about your physical experience today
[59:38] because nobody has guarantee about
[59:40] tomorrow right so while we're talking
[59:43] about the Hope in Bitcoin and that um
[59:48] you know we of course want to use it as
[59:50] a storage of value and our goal
[59:52] eventually is that it is a mold of
[59:54] transaction
[59:56] life today is still the most important
[59:59] if that means if you if it means you
[60:01] stack less set SATs but you get to take
[60:04] your kids on a fishing trip and you
[60:06] build that life
[60:08] experience I feel like that is the way
[60:12] to go and probably a lot of bitcoiners
[60:15] would disagree with me and be like no no
[60:17] no you need to be hling every dollar
[60:19] that you have but I just want to remind
[60:21] everyone that that you still have to
[60:23] live today today you you live in this
[60:26] physical space you need to make the most
[60:28] of today and do what makes your heart
[60:30] sing and yes hle but that should not be
[60:33] the number one n all be all unless
[60:36] that's what makes your heart
[60:38] sing it's also interesting I I had think
[60:42] a week ago or two weeks ago the podcast
[60:44] with Mark he's he's the guy that always
[60:47] has his Bitcoin talks in the pool on
[60:49] YouTube he like a small he's coming up
[60:52] now and he's he has his podcast and is
[60:54] really a fun guy uh to watch and he
[60:57] basically has this concept of you should
[61:00] not die with all your toys like you
[61:03] should uh you should collect memories
[61:06] and you should do something with your
[61:08] life and you should not then uh huddle
[61:11] hdle hdle and then die with all your
[61:13] Bitcoin like that's that's maybe good if
[61:16] you want to give every all your wealth
[61:19] to your kids um but uh you should also
[61:22] experience life you should have fun with
[61:24] your kids uh and make those memories
[61:26] with your kids while you're alive and
[61:28] not just give them aot a bunch of money
[61:30] so that that concept is I think very
[61:34] very good and bitcoiners are getting
[61:36] very very aggressive when you tell them
[61:38] they can spend and sell their Bitcoin at
[61:41] some points like there there are good
[61:43] ways of spending their Bitcoin uh and uh
[61:47] it's it's it's a funny because yeah it's
[61:49] this this hle and never sell and always
[61:51] buy and what what's the point of always
[61:54] buying and never selling like that that
[61:57] you should your life's goal should not
[61:59] be having as much Bitcoin as possible
[62:03] right and there's a difference between
[62:05] money and wealth and I just want to say
[62:07] as a parent of four grown kids um we've
[62:10] had many discussions over the years
[62:12] because I chose to homeschool and stay
[62:14] at home and so if I had continued on in
[62:18] my Investment Banking Journey um I think
[62:21] will be much more wealthy today
[62:24] MoneyWise than than what we actually
[62:27] where we actually are but if you ask the
[62:29] kids the true wealth when you're growing
[62:31] up is the attention that you get from
[62:34] your parents and the loving experiences
[62:36] that you go through it will never be the
[62:40] fancy Vacations or the trust fund that
[62:43] you can leave to them that's not wealth
[62:46] that's just money so that's that's my um
[62:49] sort of my call
[62:51] to whoever's
[62:54] listening I love it so much
[62:56] really cool uh thank you so much we have
[62:58] the end routine where the previous guest
[63:00] is asking a question for the next guest
[63:01] without knowing who the next guest
[63:03] actually is and sometimes I feel like uh
[63:06] people have the feeling that I pick
[63:08] those questions out of a pool or
[63:10] something but it's actually the the
[63:12] previous guest asked actually that very
[63:14] question to you how can you orange peill
[63:17] kids better how can I orange pill kids
[63:20] better I I think that's actually the
[63:22] wrong question to ask I think there are
[63:25] three things that you need to focus on
[63:28] for the Next
[63:29] Generation Um i' I've already talked
[63:31] about Breck crumbs of knowledge or just
[63:35] spotlighting what's happening in society
[63:38] and and know that there is event there
[63:42] is an alternative out there but I think
[63:44] more important than that if you look at
[63:46] the statistics of mental health in the
[63:50] Next Generation Um I think that's the mo
[63:53] that's the more important question to
[63:54] ask
[63:56] you can't orange
[63:58] pill a generation of kids if they are
[64:03] passively
[64:04] accepting what's handed to them so
[64:09] that's again okay I'm going to go back
[64:11] to my books because that's that's one of
[64:13] the topics that I really want to
[64:15] address which is um we have we have a
[64:18] generation of kids that are being
[64:19] brought up where they're
[64:21] told first of all we've already talked
[64:23] about the labels but they're told
[64:26] that especially in the the public school
[64:28] even the private school system that um
[64:31] you're supposed to stand in line you're
[64:32] supposed to walk in line you're supposed
[64:35] to raise your hand to ask a question you
[64:37] have to ask for permission to go to the
[64:38] bathroom so every you if you have an
[64:40] issue with a fellow classmate you go to
[64:42] the teacher you don't try to solve it
[64:44] you go to the teacher you go to the
[64:45] counselor you go to the principal you
[64:46] get you get an adult to help you that's
[64:48] we say that a lot get an adult to help
[64:50] you if you if you get into a problem you
[64:54] get an adult to help you and what I'm
[64:56] seeing now observing my friend's um
[65:01] classmates is a generation of kids that
[65:05] just accept things as they are um an
[65:08] example is um they were my my uh my kids
[65:13] friends were sharing with me an
[65:15] experience over the summer where they
[65:17] are working as a event planner uh weight
[65:21] weight staff um and they were carrying
[65:23] out food and a grape rolled off a plate
[65:26] and fell onto the ground and there were
[65:28] four of them and they stood there and
[65:31] said should we pick it up it was a grape
[65:35] that fell on the ground that I guess my
[65:37] step on but they asked that question
[65:39] first and why is it because they feel
[65:41] like they're not allowed to they
[65:43] shouldn't do anything that hasn't been
[65:45] asked or it doesn't matter it's not
[65:47] their job like what is the question
[65:49] right and so I feel like to Orange
[65:51] pillow kids you need to First address
[65:52] their sense of self value and their
[65:54] sense of self empowerment so that they
[65:57] can grow up and ask questions of what is
[65:59] happening in the current system
[66:02] otherwise you're telling them to believe
[66:05] one thing is just a race against
[66:07] somebody else telling them one thing
[66:09] first does that make sense and so the
[66:12] early reader series focuses on
[66:14] empowering kids to look at themselves as
[66:16] capable people capable of solving their
[66:18] own problems and looking for solutions
[66:20] to make positive impact in other
[66:22] people's lives and I think that actually
[66:25] is more of a key than just telling them
[66:28] about
[66:28] Bitcoin I I love that a lot don't give
[66:31] them the fish learn them how to how to
[66:33] uh fish them themselves really really
