[00:00] Bitcoin is that escape. It's It's as if
[00:02] one of those cows found a breach in the
[00:04] fence and they're freeing themselves.
[00:06] And now everyone realizes that every
[00:08] time a cow pushes through there, that
[00:10] breach is getting a little wider and and
[00:12] is getting noticed by more of the more
[00:14] of the herd. And no one's just going to
[00:16] sit in there if there is an escape from
[00:18] that situation. They're not just going
[00:20] to sit there and allow themselves to
[00:21] just continuously be milked.
[00:22] Disciplines. You have to understand
[00:24] economics. You have to understand
[00:25] cryptography. You have to understand
[00:26] geopolitics. You have to understand game
[00:28] theory. You have to understand all these
[00:29] different things. So, which makes it
[00:31] very very interesting for us to look
[00:33] into all those things. If you're a kind
[00:34] of a intellectually curious-minded
[00:36] person, Satoshi saw the answer. I saw
[00:39] the problem, but Satoshi saw the answer.
[00:41] Kind of codified American values. If you
[00:42] just think of life, liberty, property,
[00:44] like Bitcoin just is those things. It's
[00:46] inherently American, I think. And I'm
[00:48] not to say that freedom only exists in
[00:50] America, but the way we have our
[00:51] founding documents laid out, Bitcoin
[00:53] perfectly aligns with it in a codified,
[00:55] immutable way. I think it's a
[00:56] combination of those things. I think
[00:57] it's that strategic Bitcoin reserve for
[00:59] us, stable coins for you. Buy us a
[01:01] little bit of time.
[01:04] [Music]
[01:06] I did some more research and I saw that
[01:09] you are a private pilot and you were in
[01:11] the military before. I think that's that
[01:12] that was new to me actually. Yeah, I had
[01:14] a brief brief stint. Yeah, I was uh but
[01:17] yeah, I I fly now. So, I'm a pilot now
[01:19] full-time. So, this is kind of the uh
[01:21] the podcasting is kind of the side the
[01:23] side hustle, you know, the passion
[01:24] project. Awesome. Really cool. Uh but
[01:27] but was the pilot something you did al
[01:29] already before Bitcoin or is this
[01:30] something now that you you started
[01:32] doing? Oh no. Yeah. Pilot's been my gig
[01:35] for years and years now. That's that's
[01:36] kind of the breaded that's the bread
[01:38] winner. That's the sat the sat mining.
[01:40] It's excuse me uh flying the airplanes.
[01:43] So flying the airplanes is my full-time
[01:45] gig and then uh I just do the uh the
[01:48] podcasting as kind of a side passion
[01:50] project just because I really believe in
[01:52] Bitcoin. I love Bitcoin and I want
[01:54] everyone else to see what we see. So
[01:56] that's kind of my way to give back and
[01:58] hopefully on board uh all the newcomers
[02:01] that I like believe are still to come.
[02:03] So really interesting. Just for me to
[02:05] understand um what did you like with the
[02:08] with the private pilot and and also saw
[02:11] that you did something with military
[02:13] what actually did you do before Bitcoin
[02:15] and and uh outside of Bitcoin maybe that
[02:18] is a little bit interesting. Yeah. Okay.
[02:20] So, um, the way the way I found Bitcoin
[02:22] maybe in the first place was, uh, I had
[02:24] half of the homework kind of already
[02:25] done. So, um, long story going back, I
[02:28] was, uh, aviation, uh, I got an older
[02:31] brother that was in the Air Force. I was
[02:32] kind of thinking I might do that. Um, I
[02:35] had a fighter jet job in the Air
[02:37] National Guard, but I got it pulled
[02:40] medically only because, long story, but
[02:43] I had a PRK at the time, eye surgery,
[02:45] and uh, developed a little cataract
[02:47] because of the surgery and then got
[02:49] medically disqualified from the pilot
[02:50] slot in the military. So, then I
[02:52] couldn't actually pursue that. Uh, that
[02:55] led me, this was kind of in the, you
[02:57] know, early 2000s or 2000s. So um you
[03:00] know 9/11 had happened and terrorism was
[03:03] the hot button issue and those kind of
[03:04] things. So I decided to go back to
[03:07] graduate school and I got a master's in
[03:08] international
[03:10] security and you know we kind of were
[03:12] charged with looking at all the
[03:13] different threats you know what's you
[03:15] know what's kind of the the asymmetric
[03:17] threats to the United States. I came to
[03:19] the conclusion back then um our biggest
[03:22] threat was our own fiscal
[03:24] irresponsibility. It wasn't really
[03:26] somebody hiding in a cave in Afghanistan
[03:28] or somebody, you know, some some
[03:29] nearpeer kind of invading America. So, I
[03:31] did all my research on national debt
[03:34] dynamics and how that national debt and
[03:36] the growing of that debt and the
[03:37] compounding interest was going to end up
[03:39] putting us in a very uh unfortunate
[03:42] fiscal position as we moved forward. So,
[03:44] I always like to say that um Satoshi saw
[03:47] the answer. I saw the problem, but
[03:49] Satoshi saw the answer. So, but but for
[03:51] a long time, I'd kind of given up on it.
[03:53] I kind of thought um I just watched that
[03:56] math compound. I think I was you know I
[03:58] was doing most of my research when the
[03:59] US national debt was maybe 9 trillion10
[04:01] trillion and I was like hey guys this is
[04:04] going to be a problem and then I just
[04:06] watched it become a problem over the
[04:08] next decade. it just went from, you
[04:10] know, 10 trillion to now we're sitting
[04:12] at 36.5 trillion. And now it's becoming
[04:15] pretty obvious to everybody um that the
[04:18] debt is a problem. And it's actually
[04:20] causing us to actually it's forcing a
[04:22] response that's we just can't allow $2
[04:25] trillion deficits to pile up. We're at a
[04:27] $2.8 trillion deficit run rate of the US
[04:30] this year. So it was going from 1
[04:32] trillion to two trillion to pushing
[04:33] three trillion. And you know, we only
[04:34] take in four and a half$5 trillion of
[04:37] tax revenue a year anyway. So, um, it
[04:40] was eating the whole budget. I kind of
[04:41] had foreseen this when I was in doing
[04:44] graduate work and I just got to the
[04:45] point that I was like, we're doomed.
[04:47] Like, this math, there's no escaping
[04:49] this math. And obviously, I didn't see
[04:51] Bitcoin at that time, but I was like,
[04:53] there's no escaping this math. We're
[04:54] going to dirt this thing. So, I just
[04:56] kind of became nihilistic about things
[04:59] and I was like, you know what? I love
[05:00] aviation. I'm just going to go fly. I'm
[05:02] just going to leave this alone because
[05:04] there I didn't see any real solution.
[05:06] And then um so I only say that because I
[05:09] also people are always like, "Oh, I kind
[05:11] of missed Bitcoin or I didn't notice
[05:12] it." I had done half of the work to
[05:16] understanding Bitcoin. I was uh I
[05:18] already knew everything about Austrian
[05:19] economics. I was laser focused on the
[05:22] debt being a problem. Um I So half of
[05:25] the equation, the economic side of the
[05:26] equation, the sound money kind of part
[05:29] of the equation I had already done. And
[05:31] I also missed Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin just
[05:33] seemed like I'd heard about it. I also
[05:35] dismissed it. I was like, even if that
[05:37] works, I don't understand it, but even
[05:38] if it did work, there's no way the
[05:41] government's going to allow this to
[05:42] happen. I that's where I I started in
[05:43] that camp. I didn't realize how robust
[05:45] it was against attack or how resilient
[05:47] it would be in the face of adversaries.
[05:49] So, I also missed it. And then it was um
[05:52] you know, kind of COVID era where the
[05:54] world slowed down and I took another
[05:56] bite at that apple. I remember my
[05:58] brother calling me out of the blue and
[05:59] asking me about Ethereum and it was
[06:01] looking into what the hell Ethereum was.
[06:04] I kind of was like, I don't know, man. I
[06:05] think it's like Bitcoin's little
[06:07] brother. I don't think it's that like I
[06:08] I'll I'll look into it. And just doing a
[06:11] little bit of digging on Ethereum kind
[06:13] of got me to really understand Bitcoin.
[06:14] And then I was like, god dang it, man.
[06:17] Like this solution's been in front of
[06:20] your face. The thing you were looking
[06:21] for for 20 years has been right in front
[06:24] of your face the whole time and you
[06:26] missed it. So only say that because um
[06:29] it's difficult thing. We we know this
[06:32] when we're trying to explain Bitcoin to
[06:33] people. It's a difficult thing to
[06:35] understand because you have to know you
[06:37] have to understand so many different
[06:39] disciplines. You have to understand
[06:40] economics, you have to understand
[06:41] cryptography, you have to understand
[06:43] geopolitics, you have to understand game
[06:45] theory, you have to understand all these
[06:46] different things. So which makes it very
[06:48] very interesting for us to look into all
[06:50] those things if you're kind of a
[06:52] intellectually curious-minded person.
[06:54] But it's also just a lot to take on for
[06:56] just a common guy that's just, you know,
[06:58] working his nineto-ive lunch pailing it
[07:00] and trying to feed his kids. It's it's a
[07:02] hard thing to be like, "Oh, yeah. Oh,
[07:04] and by the way, you know, I have I'll
[07:05] spend all my extra time reading
[07:08] economics books." You know, it's just
[07:09] not really tenable for your average
[07:11] person. That's a interesting the
[07:13] background. Uh maybe a stupid question,
[07:16] but what is international security? So,
[07:18] you basically assess the risks that can
[07:21] come to a country. Uh yeah, it was
[07:23] essentially like um it was like a
[07:24] political science masters and I had a
[07:27] focus in intelligence. So it was kind of
[07:29] just doing um intelligence analysis at
[07:32] at that point and trying to figure out
[07:33] what those threats were. So it was
[07:35] obviously very at that time very kind of
[07:38] um counterterrorism, counterinsurgency
[07:40] focused, but I just I just looked at the
[07:44] playing board and I was like, "Hey guys,
[07:45] none of these these are problems for
[07:47] sure." Sure. Like I mean there's there's
[07:48] no doubt that terrorism is a problem and
[07:50] could cause problems and causes deaths
[07:52] and something that needs to be uh
[07:54] vigilantly looked at and followed. But
[07:56] um I just came to the conclusion big
[07:59] picture that was like I'm not really
[08:01] worried about these guys. They're going
[08:02] to cause disruptions but they don't seem
[08:04] like an existential threat to my
[08:06] country. What seems like an existential
[08:08] threat to my country is how
[08:10] irresponsible we're being with the money
[08:13] and the spending and the money printing
[08:15] etc. So, and I think that's what we're
[08:17] seeing. It's like terrorism is still a
[08:19] problem, but you know, we're not fast
[08:22] forward 20 years. That debt problem has
[08:24] become much bigger. I think you could
[08:26] argue that the terrorism um problem has
[08:29] maybe stayed about the same or even
[08:30] maybe gotten a little bit of smaller
[08:32] since the 2000s. So, I think that the
[08:35] world is kind of playing that theory out
[08:37] where I think we're getting to the point
[08:39] now where even the United States
[08:41] government understands that they're in a
[08:43] completely untenable fiscal position and
[08:45] something has to be done at this point.
[08:48] Yeah, the adapter is is f and then I
[08:51] always look at because um my my dad long
[08:56] before uh I got him into Bitcoin and I
[08:59] was in Bitcoin long before he already
[09:01] talked about how irresponsible
[09:03] governments are doing with money, how
[09:05] big of a depth we have and how bad it is
[09:07] for the next generation. But he always
[09:09] also said like but every country is
[09:11] doing it. So yeah, how how bad is it?
[09:14] And for me now is like yeah if every
[09:17] country is doing the fiat game maybe
[09:19] there's like not an imbalance between
[09:21] the countries uh because like everyone
[09:23] plays the same game but as soon as one
[09:25] country starts to adopt Bitcoin this
[09:28] country will start to get ahead and and
[09:31] will start to accumulate a lot more
[09:33] wealth over time and that's that's
[09:35] basically what we've seen 2021 with with
[09:37] with El Salvador. How do you look at um
[09:40] the depth problem uh when when kind of
[09:43] the argument is and I get that actually
[09:45] from some people but doesn't everyone do
[09:47] the field game like because everyone
[09:50] does it is it not good uh and how do you
[09:52] look at when all of the sudden countries
[09:54] like El Salvador or Bhutan maybe also
[09:57] America uh in in the future a little bit
[10:00] more aggressive uh not just declaring
[10:02] the Bitcoin that they have as a big
[10:05] reserve but actually buying also some.
[10:07] How do you look at that picture? Uh,
[10:09] yeah, really good question, man. It
[10:11] reminds me of um the book The Sovereign
[10:13] Individual. There's a there's a passage
[10:15] in that book, I'm going to just
[10:16] paraphrase it, but they basically say
[10:18] that, you know, governments no longer
[10:20] respect us, they basically treat us like
[10:22] cows in the pasture waiting to be
[10:24] milked. So, when everyone is doing this
[10:27] fiat printing game and everyone is a
[10:29] prisoner to that monetary monopoly, you
[10:32] can uh you can have a lot of hubris as
[10:34] the money printer or as the authority.
[10:36] you can really kind of abuse those
[10:38] people because you know like in in your
[10:40] eyes there was no escape. So if there's
[10:43] no way to escape the plantation, you can
[10:45] whip, you know, you can whip the workers
[10:46] as many times a day as you want to.
[10:48] Well, their problem was and I think what
[10:50] they're coming to realize now is Bitcoin
[10:53] is that escape. It's it's as if one of
[10:55] those cows found a breach in the fence
[10:57] and they're freeing themselves. And now
[10:59] everyone realizes that every time a cow
[11:02] pushes through there, that breach is
[11:03] getting a little wider and and is
[11:05] getting noticed by more of the more of
[11:07] the herd. And no one's just going to sit
[11:09] in there if there is an escape from that
[11:11] situation. They're not just going to sit
[11:13] there and allow themselves to just
[11:14] continuously be milked. So I think it
[11:16] was a situation where no one really
[11:18] believed or was paying enough attention.
[11:21] you know, maybe, you know, El Salvador
[11:22] was just one cow leaving, you know, and
[11:24] then maybe Bhutan is two cows leaving
[11:27] and then, you know, suddenly you're
[11:28] starting to realize it was like if the
[11:30] everyone's leaving, like there's no way
[11:32] we can't repair the fence. We can't keep
[11:33] them in here anymore. There is an escape
[11:35] hatch, particularly it being Bitcoin,
[11:37] where you can't just go mend the fence.
[11:38] Like Bitcoin is not something you can
[11:40] just go shut down or stop or uh you
[11:42] know, so I think they're starting to
[11:44] understand that. And I I think we almost
[11:47] jumped the shark on it where um I
[11:50] believe that the world was considering
[11:53] trying to box it in. They were
[11:55] considering trying to see what they
[11:57] could do. Hopefully do some
[11:58] international coordination between
[12:00] central banks, between, you know, large
[12:01] nation states and put a kind of try to
[12:03] put a cap on this thing or just be like,
[12:05] "Hey, okay, we'll allow it to maybe be u
[12:08] an asset, but it's definitely not going
[12:09] to be money." Like playing those kind of
[12:11] games and just seeing what they could
[12:12] get away with. I think now you're seeing
[12:14] um the people that are the most well
[12:17] educated about it. I think they're
[12:20] starting to understand and starting to
[12:21] advocate it was like you cannot stop
[12:23] this thing and if you cannot stop it it
[12:26] becomes kind of a like the safeadine
[12:28] idea of gunpowder like if you cannot
[12:30] stop it you get put in the join or die
[12:32] position. So, I think we're getting to
[12:34] the point here that I know even in our
[12:37] first conversation we talked about how I
[12:39] was hoping Bitcoin would make America
[12:41] force them to be more American again.
[12:43] And u I think in some ways it's exactly
[12:46] what it's doing. I think they realize
[12:47] they cannot stop it and they're starting
[12:50] to understand the game theory math of
[12:51] this all where if you cannot stop it,
[12:54] you almost have to be first. So, uh I
[12:57] always wanted America to be first. I
[12:59] thought that Bitcoin was um kind of
[13:01] codified American values. If you just
[13:03] think of life, liberty, property, like
[13:05] Bitcoin just is those things. It's
[13:07] inherently American. I think and I'm not
[13:09] to say that freedom only exists in
[13:10] America, but the way we have our
[13:12] founding documents laid out, Bitcoin
[13:14] perfectly aligns with it in a codified
[13:16] immutable way. Uh, so I always wanted us
[13:18] to go first. Thought we should go first,
[13:20] but thought we would not go first
[13:22] because we've enjoyed this exorbitant
[13:24] privilege of having the reserve currency
[13:25] for decades and decades, which allows us
[13:28] to steal from the entire world and make
[13:30] our standard of living better. So, no
[13:33] one's just going to give that up kind of
[13:34] voluntarily. But I think the power of
[13:36] Bitcoin is it's kind of signaled that
[13:39] it's here. It's here to stay. People are
[13:41] starting to notice that. And if that's
[13:43] going to be the reality, if you don't go
[13:45] first, you you're last. You know, it's
[13:48] like if you don't go first, you're bored
[13:49] in Southwest with C74 on your pass and
[13:52] you're gonna get the shittiest seat on
[13:54] the plane. So, I think that's what the
[13:56] US is starting to realize. And um I
[13:59] think now that they've signaled from the
[14:02] very top with the whole SPR idea, the
[14:04] strategic Bitcoin reserve idea. Now that
[14:06] they've signaled that, I know people
[14:08] were a little bit disappointed by it
[14:10] because it was like, oh, they didn't
[14:11] come out and just say, you know, we're
[14:12] buying hundred billion dollars of this
[14:14] thing. But I think if you have trust in
[14:16] that game theory, you know that's coming
[14:18] next because once they once they started
[14:20] the gun and started the race, you have
[14:23] no choice but to race. So I think people
[14:26] will be surprised of the size and just
[14:28] how quickly this comes together because
[14:31] I think the people driving that part of
[14:34] the agenda do understand that only one
[14:37] nation is going to be able to carve out
[14:39] a dominant position dominant position in
[14:41] this new monetary network and they want
[14:44] to be that that person and they're going
[14:46] to figure that part out. So I think it's
[14:48] going to happen faster than people
[14:50] think. So if you were disappointed on,
[14:52] you know, on game day, just just wait a
[14:55] few months and I think you'll be
[14:56] surprised at how much progress is made.
[14:58] Yeah. The idea that uh Robert Kenny Jr.
[15:01] I think brought up with accumulating 20
[15:04] or 25% of the Bitcoin supply. Uh I think
[15:07] it was 4 million Bitcoin, which he he he
[15:10] shouted out, which is for me an absurd
[15:13] big amount. And I'm not even sure how
[15:15] how fast they could get there and what
[15:17] would happen with Bitcoin if they
[15:18] actually had that goal of accumulating
[15:20] so many. Um, but it's it's it's it's
[15:23] fascinating to see uh and play out in
[15:26] real time this year, next year, the next
[15:28] 10 years, how the US is now starting
[15:31] from, hey, let's do those 200,000
[15:34] Bitcoin that we have and name it strate
[15:36] strategic Bitcoin
[15:37] reserve. How do we go from here to maybe
[15:40] having half a million or a million
[15:42] Bitcoin? because they should at least
[15:44] have more than micro strategy. I guess
[15:47] a US company should not have more than
[15:49] uh than US itself. I mean I'm big
[15:53] believer that citizens and the private
[15:55] companies should have more but in their
[15:57] eyes they should uh they they don't want
[16:00] to be lower than a a company. Uh so it
[16:04] will be really fun to to see how this
[16:06] all shakes out. How do you actually look
[16:08] at uh those things and also Doge and
[16:10] Trump and and the Bitcoin strategy and
[16:12] what's going on currently? Yeah, I mean
[16:15] very interesting, very big idea. I think
[16:16] what's interesting about strategy is
[16:18] strategyy's kind of proven at the
[16:19] corporation level that if you're a first
[16:21] mover, you can basically build a lead
[16:24] that is insurmountable. And I think um I
[16:27] don't think that signal's been lost at
[16:28] the nation state level of game theory of
[16:31] just like strategy is going to be the
[16:33] one corporation that can get to probably
[16:35] half a million Bitcoin. there's really
[16:37] nobody else out there that'll probably
[16:38] be able to catch them at that point.
[16:40] They've already established that
[16:41] dominant position on the corporation
[16:43] level. I think um whoever moves first in
[16:46] size, it's not that El Salvador doesn't
[16:48] matter, but they're a small country.
[16:49] Bhutan's a small country. Whichever
[16:51] large kind of G7 power country moves in
[16:54] size first is going to do the same thing
[16:57] strategy did on the corporate level.
[16:58] They're going to they're going to make
[16:59] an insurmountable leave at the at the
[17:00] nation state level. They're going to be
[17:02] the the network leader. They're going to
[17:04] have all the leverage. So, someone's
[17:06] going to realize that and got to figure
[17:07] figure that out and I hope it's going to
[17:09] be us. Uh, it looks like it very well
[17:12] could be us. Um, and I think all the
[17:14] other things happening um at the nation
[17:17] state level are kind of indicative of
[17:19] that goal and that hopefully we're going
[17:21] to be able to move fast enough to
[17:23] establish that dominant position. Uh,
[17:24] the way I look at the strategic Bitcoin
[17:26] reserve and Doge and all of these
[17:28] things, I think it's a it's a
[17:29] combination of both of those things. So,
[17:31] it's the it's the impossible fiscal
[17:33] position that the United States realizes
[17:35] it's in. We've just over the last few
[17:37] years watched our deficit go from 1
[17:38] trillion to 2 trillion. Now, we're at a
[17:40] burn rate of 2.8 trillion. We realize we
[17:42] can't escape that math now. So, I think
[17:45] all the people in the know are like,
[17:46] okay, well, what what comes next? If you
[17:48] believe uh Howard Lutnik, who's our new
[17:51] commerce secretary, the whole kind of
[17:53] idea was we're running a$ two trillion
[17:55] dollar deficit. I need Doge and Elon to
[17:58] go find me a trillion dollars of cuts. I
[18:01] need to go find a trillion dollars of
[18:02] revenue. That brings us down to a, you
[18:05] know, just budget, a balanced budget at
[18:08] that point. And then we can, you know,
[18:10] start doing tax cuts and other things
[18:11] that they want to accomplish. I think
[18:13] that's very ambitious. I will say um
[18:15] I've been somewhat surprised at just how
[18:18] I knew my government was wasteful, but
[18:19] I've been very surprised just how much
[18:22] waste Doge has been able to find and
[18:24] just turning over the first couple couch
[18:26] cushions, you're just like, "Holy crap."
[18:28] Uh this is a much more worse situation
[18:31] than I thought it was. But the good part
[18:33] about that is maybe they're going to be
[18:34] able to find far more government cuts
[18:37] than was ne necessarily initially
[18:39] anticipated. Um, but it's still an
[18:41] ambitious goal only because if you break
[18:43] down the numbers of like the United
[18:44] States budget easily, we spend about 7
[18:47] trillion a year. We bring in roughly 5
[18:50] trillion a year. But that five trillion
[18:52] is completely spent through budget or uh
[18:56] interest on the national debt. That's
[18:57] about a trillion dollars a year.
[18:59] Military in the United States is just
[19:01] under a trillion dollars a year.
[19:02] Medicare and Social Security are just
[19:04] about one and a half trillion a piece.
[19:06] So there's your five trillion right
[19:07] there. That's all the money you take in,
[19:09] just those four things, those four
[19:11] programs. So, if you want to try to
[19:13] balance the budget, at least
[19:15] conceptually, if you can't find a ton of
[19:17] waste inside those other budget items
[19:20] that bring that number down, you have to
[19:22] get rid of the entire government. And
[19:23] even if you got rid of the entire
[19:25] government, every single agency, every
[19:27] single employee, every single thing,
[19:29] every single building, you still are
[19:32] basically running a deficit at that
[19:34] point. So, I just don't think everyone
[19:35] realizes the gravity of just how bad
[19:37] that fiscal position has gotten. So, I
[19:39] think the these guys are taking some
[19:41] pretty gross input, egregious moves
[19:45] right out of the gates and it's making
[19:46] people here a lot of nervous, you know,
[19:48] like they're they're cutting entire
[19:50] agencies. They're laying off thousands
[19:51] of people. They're putting tariffs on
[19:53] the whole world, but and it all seems
[19:56] like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, like this is
[19:58] this is too much. It's too much too
[19:59] fast. And I think in some ways they're
[20:01] kind of following the Javier Malay model
[20:04] in Argentina where you just kind of come
[20:06] in and just a just start ripping
[20:08] band-aids off and just reset and just
[20:10] kind of rebuild in the way you want to
[20:12] rebuild. But I just don't think that um
[20:15] we it seems like too much. If I was
[20:18] going to as a pilot, if I was going to
[20:19] make an airplane analogy here, when
[20:21] you're flying an airplane, you never
[20:22] want to make gross control inputs
[20:24] because you can put you can put the
[20:26] aircraft in an unstable position. You
[20:28] can stall it out. you can, you know, go
[20:30] over its maneuvering speed, do
[20:31] structural damage to an aircraft. That
[20:34] being said, if if you're flying towards
[20:36] a mountain and your only choice is to
[20:39] make gross control inputs or hit that
[20:41] mountain, then all deals are off. Then
[20:44] you're willing to stress the airframe a
[20:45] little bit. You're willing to kind of
[20:46] like put a a gross control input just to
[20:49] stay alive. So, um, it's kind of
[20:52] interesting where people say like, uh,
[20:54] you know, people find Bitcoin when they
[20:56] need Bitcoin, and it's not really the
[20:58] privileged people that find it first.
[21:00] It's usually someone that has a real
[21:02] need to find it. I think you can argue
[21:04] now that we're starting to recognize
[21:05] that the United States, although it is
[21:06] the world's superpower and it's had the
[21:08] reserve currency, they're starting to
[21:10] run that budget debt math and they're
[21:12] starting to realize that it's like for
[21:14] them, Bitcoin is not a nice to have.
[21:16] Bitcoin is a need to have. So, you bring
[21:19] up um you bring up like RFK and this
[21:21] very ambitious goal of basically trying
[21:23] to match our gold reserves with Bitcoin.
[21:26] So, we have like whatever 5% of the
[21:27] world's gold. Let's have 5% of the
[21:28] world's Bitcoin. Um I think I think when
[21:32] I think of RFK, I think of um his uncle,
[21:35] you know, late President JFK that you
[21:37] know was assassinated. Um he used to say
[21:41] uh ask not what your country can do for
[21:44] you, ask what you can do for your
[21:46] country. And I think if we think about
[21:48] that in Bitcoin terms, that's where
[21:50] we're at with Bitcoin. It's not it's not
[21:52] what my country can do for Bitcoin.
[21:55] Bitcoin is going to be fine. I could
[21:56] give a crap if my my country actually
[21:58] gets a Bitcoin reserve or starts buying
[22:00] it, but my country needs a Bitcoin. So,
[22:03] it's it's what what can Bitcoin do for
[22:05] my country? Because I think it's the
[22:06] only way um that I see and I think it's
[22:10] the only proposal that's been put out
[22:11] there that actually gives us a path to
[22:14] crawl out of this hole that we've built.
[22:16] So, you know, there's Cynthia Lumis and
[22:18] Michael Sailor. They've been doing this
[22:20] kind of math of, you know, if we're able
[22:22] to buy Bitcoin now and we actually, you
[22:24] know, are able to pass this through
[22:25] Congress and get an actual Bitcoin
[22:27] reserve that we start to fund over the
[22:28] next 5 years, you can actually see and
[22:31] then there's a 20-year lockup where we
[22:33] lock up that Bitcoin. We allow it to
[22:35] acrue value density and then hopefully
[22:37] use that only to pay off the debt in 20
[22:39] years. So where we pulled the whole
[22:41] future forward and spent all of our
[22:43] kids' future right out from under their
[22:44] legs. Now this allows us to lock up, you
[22:47] know, get that first mover advantage
[22:49] just like everybody in Bitcoin knows if
[22:51] you're in early, everyone that comes
[22:53] later floats you. So I think that's what
[22:55] they're going to try to do at the nation
[22:56] state level. And it's really the only
[22:57] way you can get out of an impossible
[22:59] fiscal position because we're not going
[23:01] to be able to grow our way out of it.
[23:03] we're not going to be able to do all
[23:03] these things because um with the Jeff
[23:06] Booth idea of productivity and we know
[23:10] that AI is coming and robotics are
[23:12] coming and it's going to be this very
[23:13] deflationary economy that's in a vacuum
[23:16] going to acrue a lot of purchasing power
[23:19] to the dollar because it's going to
[23:20] become so much more efficient. But when
[23:23] you're that debt laden, you can't afford
[23:26] any purchasing power to acrue to your
[23:28] currency because the whole thing was
[23:29] kind of built on this way that no one
[23:31] can escape and we're going to be able to
[23:33] ponzi this thing down. So you can't
[23:36] allow for purchasing power because
[23:37] you're already in insolvent insolvent
[23:39] fiscal position and every ounce of
[23:42] purchasing power that goes into your
[23:43] currency now makes all of your debt
[23:45] harder to pay in real terms. So they
[23:47] haven't been able to allow that. They're
[23:49] not going to allow that and they're
[23:50] going to start pulling on both sides of
[23:51] this rubber band where technology is
[23:54] going to try to force prices to the
[23:56] floor and since you can't allow that to
[23:58] happen, you have to just continue to
[24:00] print. So, I think they saw this dynamic
[24:03] where we're we're really in trouble
[24:06] here. Like this technology is going to
[24:08] accelerate efficiency, but as a
[24:10] government being insolvent, we're going
[24:11] to have to print and steal all that
[24:13] productivity for ourselves. and the
[24:15] government's just going to continue to
[24:16] grow until it just snuffs out everything
[24:18] till it just strangles the goose. So I
[24:21] think the people um and if you Treasury
[24:24] Secretary Scott Bessent he before the
[24:26] election he had a he had an interview
[24:28] where he was basically saying you know
[24:30] within the next four or five years the
[24:32] United States is going to need some kind
[24:34] of monetary reset some kind of Bretton
[24:36] Woods 2.0. So they he kind of saw it and
[24:39] now he's got they handed him the reigns
[24:41] to Treasury. He's kind of running that
[24:43] money game from the inside. So, I think
[24:45] he understands that. I think they all
[24:47] kind of get it. And it's it's this idea
[24:49] of we cannot keep doing what we're
[24:52] doing. If we do that, we're going to fly
[24:53] this plane straight into the mountain.
[24:56] We have to do something and we have to
[24:57] do something of size there. We're kind
[24:59] of past the point where small tweaks
[25:01] will actually fix this problem. So, uh I
[25:04] don't I don't know. I'm not on the
[25:05] inside. I'm not working on this
[25:07] administration or anything like that,
[25:08] but I think that I think their ultimate
[25:11] goal is to go back to a world where
[25:16] tariffs were the revenue stream and that
[25:19] income tax was a very small part of the
[25:22] equation. So, uh, back in the late 19th
[25:25] century in America called like the
[25:27] guilded age here like 1870 to 1900 or
[25:30] even Trump himself which is also
[25:31] probably um kind of a little breadcrumb.
[25:35] He constantly is saying that the most
[25:37] prosperous time in America was from, you
[25:39] know, 1870 to 1913. He always uses 1913
[25:43] as like the ending point, which is only
[25:45] interesting because that's the year that
[25:47] we got an income tax and that's the year
[25:49] that the Fed was created. So, um, for
[25:52] the whole kind of guilded age in
[25:54] America, we ran off tariff revenue. And
[25:56] this isn't like an endorsement of like,
[25:58] hey, this current administration, what
[25:59] they're doing. It just this is what I
[26:01] think is their frame of mind is I want
[26:03] to go back to that place. That was one
[26:05] of the most prosperous economic times in
[26:07] American history and we didn't have an
[26:09] income tax and we ran everything off of
[26:11] tariffs. So um I think what changed that
[26:14] regime was and the thing that 1913
[26:16] wasn't necessarily coincidence the whole
[26:18] world's kind of uh industrial base got
[26:20] smoked during World War I. So once you
[26:24] know, you know, once Europe is
[26:25] devastated by World War I, it's hard to
[26:27] run things off of tariffs because all
[26:29] the people that were paying the tariffs
[26:30] and making the goods that you were
[26:32] tariffing in the first place, they all
[26:34] just got completely decimated by war. So
[26:36] the idea was we'll move away from this
[26:38] tariff model because it doesn't make
[26:39] sense of the current geopolitical
[26:42] climate. we'll allow Europe to rebuild
[26:44] and then and then we'll in the meantime
[26:47] we'll put this income tax in place
[26:49] that'll become the revenue stream
[26:50] temporarily or whatever it would be and
[26:52] it was only supposed to be a small tax
[26:55] on the very top earners you know the top
[26:57] 1 to 3% of income earners in the US fast
[27:00] forward now you know 100 years they
[27:03] never revisited that they never went
[27:05] back to tariffs they left the income tax
[27:07] in place and it grew to the point where
[27:10] you ever hear like tax freedom day It's
[27:12] this idea of like this is the day that
[27:15] you stop working for the government and
[27:17] actually work for yourself. And it's
[27:19] somewhere like midappril. I think it's
[27:20] like April 9th or something like that.
[27:22] So every single thing you do between
[27:24] January 1st and April 9th is just paying
[27:27] for your government. Like none of you're
[27:29] not enjoying any of that productivity
[27:31] yourself. So it's I know it's a it's
[27:33] like more than a quarter of the whole
[27:35] year you're you're just working for the
[27:37] government, not yourself. So, um, I
[27:39] think the idea is, uh, the math is
[27:43] broken, the system's broken, here's our
[27:45] opportunity. We're just going to flip
[27:47] the board over, let all the pieces fall,
[27:49] and then rebuild as as we may. So, I
[27:53] think there's a much larger plan at play
[27:55] here where they're willing to forego a
[27:58] little short-term pain with the idea
[28:00] that was like, hey, we're not finessing
[28:02] the edges here. This thing this thing is
[28:04] doomed. We have to reset the math. And
[28:06] whether that ends up resetting to a
[28:08] Bitcoin standard with that, you know,
[28:10] that Bitcoin reserve kind of at the base
[28:13] layer of that, I imagine it probably is
[28:15] some combination of that um you know,
[28:18] Bitcoin reserve on one side and then
[28:21] basically forcing stable coins on the
[28:23] entire world as a way to have a new kind
[28:26] of forced treasury buyer because I don't
[28:29] know if you noticed Tether, Tether
[28:31] became the sixth largest buyer of US
[28:34] treasuries last here. So, I think at a
[28:37] time where we've taken all these
[28:39] geopolitical steps to, you know,
[28:41] confiscate Russia's treasuries and now
[28:43] all of our adversaries are kind of don't
[28:45] really want treasuries anymore because
[28:47] we they're no longer neutral. We kind of
[28:49] reneggged on that idea that they're
[28:50] neutral. Was like, well, they're, you
[28:52] know, it's it's a perfect safe reserve
[28:54] asset as long as you do what we say. If
[28:57] you don't, then we'll just take it from
[28:59] you. So, everybody got that signal. So
[29:01] there's not as many foreign buyers of
[29:03] our treasuries. Everyone in America with
[29:06] the fact that, you know, I know they
[29:08] kind of force the CPI down. They force
[29:10] like the consumer price index, they they
[29:12] manipulate that number down, but
[29:14] everyone's starting to realize that if
[29:15] I'm holding a treasury at 4%. I'm
[29:17] getting negative real yield. I'm holding
[29:19] a negative real yielding asset because
[29:21] the actual true money printing is
[29:23] probably 8 10% something like that. I
[29:25] mean, the M2 money supply expansion is
[29:26] about 8%. So they realize they're
[29:28] bleeding out. So then it's just a matter
[29:31] of like no one really wants the
[29:32] treasuries but the one place the one
[29:34] treasury demand that is growing is this
[29:37] stable coin. So if we can kind of force
[29:39] stable coins on the whole world because
[29:41] they want dollars anyway. Usually when
[29:43] you travel people want that get their
[29:45] hands on dollars and now that we can
[29:47] give them access through that through
[29:48] tech it's like fine give them dollars
[29:50] and then we'll just force the stable
[29:51] coin issuers to become the treasury
[29:53] buyers that we lost doing all the other
[29:55] things. So um I think it's a combination
[29:57] of those things. I think it's that
[29:58] strategic Bitcoin reserve for us, stable
[30:00] coins for you, buy us a little bit of
[30:02] time, try to reset to some some kind of
[30:04] new standard. So, we'll see how it plays
[30:06] out. But I think the I think the large
[30:09] chess game going on is much larger than,
[30:12] you know, people realize when they just
[30:14] look at the stock market dropping a,000
[30:16] points and it was like, what the hell's
[30:18] going on? These guys are idiots. You
[30:19] know, it's like that's they think that's
[30:21] where it ends. I think there's a lot
[30:22] more going on in the background. Let's
[30:24] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[30:27] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[30:30] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[30:33] are the most amazing, the most elegant
[30:35] way of showing that you are a true
[30:38] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[30:41] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:44] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:46] collections. You have the date of the
[30:49] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[30:52] and of course also the block height and
[30:54] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[30:58] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:01] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[31:03] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:06] down in the descriptions. I love those
[31:08] watches so so much. And now if you have
[31:12] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[31:14] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[31:16] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[31:18] to deal with that. The first way is you
[31:21] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:23] entry for you to get into the
[31:25] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[31:29] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:31] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:34] check out the link in the description,
[31:36] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:39] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:42] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:45] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:48] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:51] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:54] that is perfect for your individual
[31:57] situation. They will show you how you
[31:59] can secure your own devices. Securing
[32:02] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[32:04] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:06] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:08] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:11] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:14] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:17] place already? And last but not least,
[32:19] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:21] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:23] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[32:28] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:31] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:34] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:36] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:39] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:42] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:44] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:46] the link down in the description of
[32:48] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:51] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:54] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:56] there. That's uh that was an amazing
[32:58] explanation. Uh I never heard it that in
[33:00] in that that way. It's it also is an
[33:04] interesting way. I mean terrorists is
[33:07] something uh very interesting that I
[33:09] just now I I hear it now in in Austria
[33:12] and Europe mainstream media is like oh
[33:14] tariff war tariff war Trump is so bad
[33:17] and like you hear that every day uh it's
[33:20] it's fascinating how mainstream media is
[33:23] obsessed with Trump they they cannot not
[33:26] mention him this was completely
[33:27] different with Biden uh when when Biden
[33:29] was in office I didn't hear a whole lot
[33:32] about uh American news and and and Biden
[33:35] Now that Trump is there, you you have
[33:37] USA almost every single day in the in
[33:40] the news cycle since basically he was
[33:44] elected. Interesting is also how a
[33:47] Bitcoin world would change taxation. How
[33:50] do you look at that? Uh yeah, that's
[33:52] interesting. Well, yeah, first part, the
[33:54] tariff part, I kind of understand why
[33:55] they're maybe hitting the sky a little
[33:56] bit because, you know, these tariffs are
[33:58] pretty pretty legitimate out of the
[34:00] gates. I would say the one thing is
[34:02] usually people worry about uh Frederick
[34:04] Bastiad. He's a great uh French
[34:05] economist. He had a he had a great quote
[34:07] where if goods don't cross borders then
[34:10] soldiers will. So I I co I completely
[34:13] sympathize with the idea of anytime
[34:15] people see tariffs it makes them very
[34:17] nervous because usually it was a imagine
[34:19] you all the nations start from zero and
[34:21] then they start to do these kind of tit
[34:23] fortat tariffs. They kind of ratchet up
[34:25] ratchet up the pressure on each other.
[34:26] It only gets makes life more expensive
[34:28] for everybody and then eventually turns
[34:30] into some kind of kinetic war. I think
[34:32] what's maybe interesting here is um uh
[34:36] in some ways the way we're doing this is
[34:38] that math is somewhat reversed because
[34:40] they're just saying hey these are just
[34:41] reciprocal and you I think you can argue
[34:43] about their methodology and how they
[34:44] came came up with a kind of a tariff for
[34:46] what nation because some of them they
[34:48] they they put in value added taxes and
[34:50] it was something some kind of
[34:52] combination of like well here's our
[34:53] trade deficit with this country and
[34:55] here's the amount of goods we take so
[34:56] tariff must be 60% or something like
[34:58] that we'll give them half of that. Um,
[35:00] so you can you can poke at the
[35:02] methodology, but the way they're
[35:03] structuring it is um, you know, these
[35:06] are just reciprocal. So, hey, if you
[35:08] want to take your tariff down to zero
[35:09] tomorrow, we'll meet you at zero. So,
[35:12] it's it's you kind of flip the incentive
[35:14] structure over where uh, countries are
[35:16] kind of incentivized to bring those
[35:18] tariffs down as opposed to to ratchet
[35:20] them up. So, it's going to be
[35:22] interesting to see if that actually
[35:23] takes and if that incentive structure
[35:24] actually works. But, theoretically, you
[35:27] could end up just removing all tariffs.
[35:29] And I even saw Scott Besson talk about
[35:31] that the idea of he equated it to like
[35:33] nuclear war but an idea of um escalate
[35:35] to deescalate where you kind of you take
[35:37] this escal escalated position but then
[35:40] put the incentive structure in place to
[35:42] actually cut cut down. You know it's
[35:44] like escalate but then everyone's going
[35:45] to start cutting their missiles down. So
[35:47] hopefully this leads us to a much freer
[35:50] trade world like world than we started
[35:53] with, you know. So, um, we'll see kind
[35:56] of how the tariffs work in that regard
[35:57] as far as like taxation goes with
[36:00] Bitcoin. Um, that's kind of interesting,
[36:02] too. I don't know if this is part of
[36:03] their calculus. I think they're maybe
[36:06] just looking at this golden age of
[36:08] America and wanting to return to that
[36:10] place and they don't really like the
[36:11] idea that they're beholden to the
[36:13] Federal Reserve and how they're
[36:16] manipulating the interest cost of money
[36:18] and that the, you know, executive branch
[36:20] has no say in that. I think that rubs
[36:22] them the wrong way. So they're like,
[36:23] "Hey, you know what? We're just going to
[36:24] make them obsolete." I think it's kind
[36:26] of the idea. So, um, uh, but it it is
[36:30] interesting because as Bitcoiners, we
[36:31] know that, uh, the beauty the beautiful
[36:34] thing about Bitcoin and the reason we
[36:35] saving it in the first place is we know
[36:37] it can't be confiscated and we know it
[36:40] cannot be debased. So, if suddenly that
[36:42] becomes the money that all of your
[36:44] people are running to to save their
[36:46] value, you're going to have to
[36:48] re-evaluate how are you going to go
[36:49] about taxing these people? because
[36:51] you've built your empire on confiscating
[36:54] their wealth and debasing their wealth
[36:56] away. So if those things are no longer
[36:58] possible, the math changes. So at that
[37:01] point, what do you do? So if and and I
[37:03] don't think that that's at the base
[37:04] level of this pivot from income tax to
[37:08] tariffs. I don't really think they're
[37:10] seeing it the way we see it. They don't
[37:12] they don't see the base level of Bitcoin
[37:14] as kind of being if you change the base
[37:16] level of money, you change all the
[37:18] structures built on top of that money. I
[37:20] don't think they're quite there yet. I
[37:22] think they're stuck in the middle. Like
[37:24] I think the idea of even this tariff
[37:27] regime is um it's
[37:31] basically Triffin's dilemma, right? We
[37:34] had the reserve currency of the world.
[37:35] It makes your it makes your currency
[37:37] relatively stronger than all other
[37:39] currencies. Everybody needs your
[37:41] currency. So you end up importing
[37:45] everything. Industrial base creates
[37:47] everything for your economy. You export
[37:48] only debt. You let that run for a little
[37:51] while, you look down and suddenly your
[37:53] own industrial base, your own
[37:54] manufacturing base is completely gone.
[37:57] And that's what's happened to the United
[37:58] States. And I think they see that the
[38:00] manufacturing base is gone. They realize
[38:02] that that's not good for the overall
[38:04] health of a country. They realize that's
[38:06] not good for the overall health of an
[38:07] economy and therefore the military
[38:09] that's built on that economy. So they
[38:11] want to reassure things. They want to
[38:13] rebuild things here in America. But
[38:16] they're looking at Triffin's dilemma and
[38:18] they're treating it. They're treating
[38:19] the symptom. They don't realize that the
[38:21] money caused that problem. And uh I
[38:23] think this is true on on both sides. And
[38:26] I have this kind of grand desire or
[38:29] hope, probably more hope, but uh like so
[38:33] they're treating that symptom of
[38:35] Triffin's dilemma with tariffs. And then
[38:37] on the on the left side of the political
[38:39] spectrum here, they hate wealth
[38:41] inequality. They think it's completely
[38:43] unfair. They're misinterpreting how that
[38:45] unfairness happened. They don't
[38:47] understand that the money printing
[38:49] causes wealth inequality. It
[38:50] mathematically redistributes money from
[38:52] the bottom to the top and concentrates
[38:54] it over time. Uh so they're also just
[38:57] trying but they want to tax the rich.
[38:58] You know, they want to tax the rich.
[38:59] They want to redistribute the money. And
[39:01] so instead of turning the washing
[39:03] machine that's taking everyone's money
[39:04] and giving it to the top in the first
[39:05] place, they just want to take it from
[39:07] the top and give it back to the bottom.
[39:08] So they're treating a symptom of money
[39:10] as well. So, everyone's treating a
[39:13] symptom and nobody's realizing that the
[39:15] disease is that money core. And I have
[39:18] this um this hope maybe that Bitcoin
[39:23] will expose this and then there could be
[39:26] this superordinate goal that actually
[39:28] brings these tribes together. And if
[39:30] you're sitting in America, that's going
[39:31] to sound nuts. The idea that anyone on
[39:34] the right and anyone on the left is
[39:35] suddenly gonna, you know, high-five
[39:37] kumbaya and like get get along right now
[39:40] seems impossible. But, you know, there
[39:43] are studies of kind of the idea of like
[39:44] tribalism and then a superordinate goal
[39:46] that brings tribes together. And I think
[39:48] you could argue that perhaps fixing the
[39:50] money since it addresses both concerns
[39:52] of both sides of the political aisle,
[39:55] maybe that could be the superordinate
[39:56] goal that actually brings people
[39:58] together. It was like, "Hey guys, I
[39:59] realize you're pissed. I realize
[40:00] everyone's pissed. like I'm pissed, but
[40:03] um you know, we're going about this the
[40:05] wrong way. It's not about wielding the
[40:07] weapon and stealing from the people and
[40:08] doing the things you want to do with the
[40:09] stolen money. It's about actually
[40:12] realizing that the money's busted below
[40:14] that layer and that if we fix that, all
[40:16] of our concerns get addressed. So, um
[40:19] long answer to that. I don't know if
[40:21] that answers the taxation question, but
[40:23] I think the beauty of like what Bitcoin
[40:25] is doing is it's rewiring the economic
[40:27] relationship where um just like people
[40:30] are starting to figure out how to get
[40:32] off the plantation um now that they
[40:34] cannot just steal your money against
[40:36] your will, they're going to have to be
[40:39] accountable to the people. And as soon
[40:41] as we're we're a ways away from that,
[40:43] it's not like every single person has
[40:45] Bitcoin and is using it and wielding its
[40:47] political power, but you do see it
[40:50] entering the arena. And I do think if we
[40:52] understand the game theory of it, it's
[40:53] going to grow in influence, and they're
[40:55] going to have no choice but to
[40:56] reevaluate that relationship. That's
[40:58] super interesting. And it it also made
[41:00] me think about how Bitcoin actually
[41:03] could change the financial system
[41:05] because our financial system uh is
[41:07] basically now depth based and what if
[41:11] that's not no longer true. Do we have
[41:13] something like credit systems? Do we
[41:15] have uh things where wealth still
[41:18] concentrates at the top because um we we
[41:21] might have a different asset, but
[41:22] there's still a credit system where
[41:25] someone that has a lot of Bitcoin gets a
[41:26] better credit score than than someone
[41:29] someone else. Um uh because even in a in
[41:32] a in a in a in a Bitcoin world, there
[41:35] could be something like a government
[41:36] token or like some some kind of credit
[41:38] system. I don't I don't know. How do you
[41:40] look actually at at at that where like I
[41:44] guess my question is how how Bitcoin
[41:46] will will change our our financial
[41:48] system. It's it's an impossible question
[41:50] to ask. Uh do do you have some framework
[41:53] to think about that? Uh yeah, sure. I
[41:55] mean I think it's a I think it's a big
[41:56] question. I think it's hard. I think
[41:58] particularly when you kind of think of
[41:59] lending and things like that, they're
[42:00] like, well, how are people going to
[42:01] borrow money? Where's it going to come
[42:03] from? as if like the only way you can
[42:05] have money to lend is if you create it
[42:08] out of nothing and steal from everybody.
[42:09] Like as if that's the only answer of
[42:11] they're like, "Okay, well, how could
[42:13] anyone ever lend money unless we just
[42:15] create money?" And it was like, "Well,
[42:16] this is how we got into this problem in
[42:18] the first place." The fact that that's
[42:19] like the first place everybody goes in
[42:21] their thinking. Um I happen to believe
[42:24] that uh all consumers are producers. So,
[42:27] uh, I'm if I'm creating, you know, if
[42:30] I'm baking pies over here and then I
[42:32] need to go make shoes, I'm a pie
[42:34] producer and I'm a shoe consumer, but
[42:36] those things negate each other because
[42:38] the guy, this guy's making shoes and
[42:39] he's buying pies. So, every producer is
[42:42] a consumer, every consumer is a
[42:43] producer. You take that into the money
[42:45] world, I think every saver is a lender
[42:49] and every borrower is like is a
[42:52] consumer, too. So like it basically
[42:54] means that everyone's saving money
[42:56] becomes the supply of money that's
[42:59] available to be lent out for other
[43:00] things and then they get some kind of
[43:03] yield for that for actually the
[43:05] opportunity cost of giving up that money
[43:06] for a certain duration of time. So it
[43:09] just becomes and and what what happens
[43:11] is this happens at a far lower far more
[43:14] efficient price level than at current
[43:17] because you can't just create oh you
[43:18] want to go you want a loan for a million
[43:19] dollars here hang on let me do some
[43:21] strokes on my keyboard here's a million
[43:23] dollars here just take it go do
[43:24] something with it and that you know you
[43:26] kind of have the base level M2 getting
[43:28] built out by the Federal Reserve and
[43:30] then you got the broadlevel M2 getting
[43:31] built out by the banking system so um
[43:34] they're all just creating money out of
[43:36] thin air and it's like oh well if we
[43:37] can't create it out thin air, where the
[43:38] hell is this going to come from? And the
[43:40] answer to that is the reason you don't
[43:42] like you get 01% on your savings account
[43:47] is because the bank doesn't give a
[43:48] about your savings account. It doesn't
[43:49] need that money to actually make loans.
[43:52] So, it doesn't care. It's like, well,
[43:55] that's great. Yeah, you can put your
[43:56] money here and it's going to like help
[43:57] our leverage ratio, but we're just going
[43:59] to create the money to lend anyway. But
[44:01] imagine you need a world where you
[44:03] actually need people to save. And that's
[44:05] the money you have to actually be
[44:07] available to lend. And then you have to
[44:09] give them a real market interest rate
[44:11] for that time cost of money that they're
[44:14] going to lock it up and allow you to
[44:15] lend it. You're going to actually have
[44:16] to compensate them. You're not going to
[44:18] be able to give them 01% on that money.
[44:20] So it's just going to um it's going to
[44:24] find a market rate for what the cost of
[44:26] money is. And that's why the Fed is so
[44:28] annoying in the first place is and how I
[44:32] get frustrated as a economist or an econ
[44:35] economic-minded person in America where
[44:38] everyone's like oh this is what
[44:40] latestage capitalism looks like and they
[44:42] just get oh here we go everyone gets
[44:44] rich everyone else is poor and I was
[44:46] like I don't know what kind of
[44:48] definition of capitalism y'all are using
[44:50] but I think you could argue that if you
[44:53] want to call us free market capitalism
[44:55] the bare minimum imum you could ask for
[44:57] is that the cost of money is a free
[45:00] market capital rate where if you're
[45:03] manipulating the cost of money that's
[45:05] worse than manipulating the cost of a
[45:07] good because you know if I manipulate
[45:09] the cost of milk it's only affecting
[45:11] milk if I manipulate the cost of
[45:13] gasoline only affecting gasoline if I
[45:16] manipulate the cost of money I
[45:18] manipulate every price and every
[45:20] economic relationship in the universe so
[45:23] I cause misallocation of capital across
[45:26] the deck, every single industry, every
[45:29] single good, every single service. So if
[45:32] we can get rid of manipulation of money,
[45:35] then you're going to find free free true
[45:38] free market prices for things including
[45:41] borrowing, including lending, and then
[45:43] then you can live in that world where
[45:46] um the money reflects the economic
[45:49] reality. So, just like I said, that
[45:50] you're pulling on that rubber band in
[45:51] both directions because you have money
[45:53] that needs to be printed, but then you
[45:55] have technology that's forcing prices
[45:56] down as fast as it can. Now, you have
[45:59] money that aligns with that reality just
[46:01] like Jeff Booth taught us in the price
[46:02] of tomorrow. And you can actually bring
[46:04] all those costs down. They all come down
[46:07] over time. It's going to be a complete
[46:09] rewiring paradigm because you're going
[46:11] to have to get used to the idea that you
[46:13] don't have to just accumulate more money
[46:15] to get richer. like you could actually
[46:18] have the same amount of money and if
[46:20] it's acrewing value density and
[46:21] purchasing power, you're becoming more
[46:23] wealthy even if you don't earn another
[46:25] SAT. So, it's rewiring the relationship
[46:28] because it's it's the same reason why
[46:31] people say like, "Oh, well, I don't want
[46:33] Bitcoin. Bitcoin has no yield." Like the
[46:35] the kind of idea of yield is us stuck in
[46:38] that old economic mindset of they don't
[46:41] necessarily we we've never really tied
[46:43] yield directly to inflation. you know,
[46:45] people that work in the industry does or
[46:47] people that work in finance do, but your
[46:49] average people don't. They just think
[46:50] they're like, "Oh, I'm making 5% on my
[46:52] money." They think they're making money.
[46:54] They don't think they're just getting
[46:55] compensated for inflation. But the idea
[46:57] of earning yield is just the idea that
[47:00] there's a hurdle rate of inflation that
[47:02] I have to keep up with. Phenomenal
[47:05] parlor trick because everybody sees
[47:07] their portfolio go up in in nominal
[47:10] numbers and they think they're genius.
[47:12] they see their house go up in nominal
[47:14] numbers, they think, "I'm a genius."
[47:16] There's like, you know, um there's
[47:18] Warren Buffets all over the place that
[47:19] are just killing this game. It's like
[47:21] somehow somehow everybody that's
[47:23] invested their money since 1990, they're
[47:26] all economic whiz kids. They're all
[47:28] they're all the best traders in the
[47:29] universe because that nominal float just
[47:31] kept going up over decades and decades.
[47:34] And nobody took the time to be like, you
[47:36] know what, everybody in the neighborhood
[47:39] can't be a financial genius. like how
[47:42] are we all how is everything going up
[47:44] all the time for everyone, you know?
[47:46] It's like so I think we're suddenly
[47:48] going to realize that it just changes
[47:50] the thing because the hurdle rate is
[47:51] this old idea that you have to beat
[47:53] inflation and but we're not even
[47:55] recognizing the inflation. So, it's it's
[47:58] as if like but I think there's going to
[47:59] be a time
[48:00] where if you can't create money out of
[48:03] nothing and you really have to match
[48:04] savers with people that want to borrow
[48:06] money, I think you still have lending,
[48:09] you still have borrowing, but the
[48:11] incentive structure makes it far more
[48:13] efficient because there's a true cost to
[48:16] giving up your money over a period of
[48:18] time uh to somebody because they're not
[48:20] just creating it out of thin air. So
[48:21] there's real opportunity cost, but if
[48:23] you're a saver, you'll get compensated
[48:25] for that appropriately. Where all those
[48:27] rates fall out, I'm not sure. But it's
[48:29] not this idea that all lending stops or
[48:31] all spending stops. I just think from
[48:34] from a personal level to a institutional
[48:37] level to a kind of borrower corporate
[48:40] level, everything gets more efficient
[48:43] because you're you're only going to be
[48:45] willing to take out a loan knowing that
[48:48] like say say make the numbers easy. If I
[48:50] take out a $100 loan right now, that's a
[48:53] no-brainer because I know I'm going to
[48:55] pay that back with dollars that are
[48:56] worth far less than the $100 that I
[48:58] borrowed. So, you're like, "Oh, yeah,
[48:59] I'll just borrow it today. No problem."
[49:01] But if I was buying a hundred borrowing
[49:03] $100 worth of Bitcoin, and I knew that
[49:07] uh this is going to be harder to pay by
[49:10] the time I pay this $100 back, it will
[49:12] it's going to be worth more than when I
[49:14] borrowed it. So now you have a real
[49:17] economic calculation to make where you
[49:20] don't just throw money everywhere. You
[49:21] don't have a guy that owns a car wash
[49:23] buying seven properties knowing they're
[49:25] all going to go up in value and that
[49:27] he's just going to pay it off with
[49:28]  dollars in the future. Like now
[49:30] you get very efficient where you're only
[49:32] willing to borrow if you really have an
[49:34] idea that will outpace the uh density
[49:38] acrruel of Bitcoin which for the short
[49:41] term that's going to be really really
[49:42] difficult to do because the thing's
[49:43] kaggering at 50% a year eventually that
[49:46] should slow down once we get far closer
[49:48] to full adoption that there will be that
[49:51] economic calculation again. ood. So the
[49:54] way I think about it is um it does
[49:56] change all the math and wiring of these
[49:58] economic relationships. It just it's but
[50:01] it doesn't stop them. It just makes them
[50:03] far more efficient. Like I think of um
[50:06] there's an attack sometimes on Bitcoin
[50:08] of like oh well if the money like how is
[50:10] any no one's going to spend any money.
[50:12] They'll just save all of their money.
[50:13] It's like it was like if it's acrewing
[50:15] value why why would they spend anything?
[50:17] And I was like well that's not true now.
[50:20] I mean now I know my money is getting
[50:23] burnt but I don't spend every single
[50:25] dime I have like but it's the same logic
[50:27] in reverse right if that's true and that
[50:30] if the money is good that people will
[50:31] never spend it then when the money's bad
[50:33] they should spend at all so the fact
[50:36] that you have savers now basically
[50:38] refutes that argument it's just going to
[50:40] be um you know it'll take from taking
[50:43] you like a you know an indiscriminate
[50:45] buyer you're you'll be an efficient
[50:47] saver and you will spend money but
[50:48] you'll just be far more deliberate and
[50:51] conscious of the opportunity cost of
[50:53] that money which forces every economic
[50:56] actor to allocate capital to the max
[50:58] efficiency possible.
[51:02] I I'm 100% Bitcoin and I do spend it. So
[51:06] because uh my my income is already uh
[51:08] mostly in Bitcoin. So I I do I am forced
[51:12] to to to spend it otherwise uh I don't
[51:15] know what else I would do because my
[51:18] income is in Bitcoin. So uh may maybe
[51:22] I'm one small example of of how people
[51:25] live on 100% Bitcoin standard. They
[51:27] understand the Bitcoin value and still
[51:29] spend it because they want to live
[51:31] because they want to also have something
[51:34] today. Uh the I I don't know uh maybe
[51:37] that's an unpopular opinion, but uh
[51:40] dying with the biggest possible Bitcoin
[51:43] stack is not something I'm looking
[51:45] forward to. I I I want to spend and use
[51:48] my Bitcoin in my lifetime. Maybe leave
[51:50] some for my kids, maybe live some
[51:52] generational wealth. Uh maybe give some
[51:54] to charity. Uh but I'm working hard uh
[51:58] to earn Bitcoin so I can also use my
[52:01] Bitcoin that I earned. So the the the
[52:04] idea that people stop spending is so
[52:08] absurd that that I'm still uh boggled
[52:12] that people still bring bring it bring
[52:15] it up and people actually do that. Uh so
[52:17] it's a good thing that we mention it but
[52:19] uh people actually have that argument
[52:20] like oh but when money is going up then
[52:23] everyone will stop spending. No, people
[52:26] will focus on the things that they
[52:28] actually value and that they actually
[52:30] need and don't spend on the all the BS
[52:33] that they don't need because they're
[52:35] incentivized to to focus on the good
[52:37] things. And also one thing that I really
[52:39] liked what you said was uh the investor
[52:41] thing because now everyone is forced to
[52:45] be investing and that's why we
[52:48] lost investor as a job because finding
[52:52] out which company is really exciting in
[52:54] in the future is a cool job like oh like
[52:57] let's dig into all the different
[52:59] companies figure out which one has a
[53:01] really good uh um uh market in the
[53:04] future and where can I put my money Now
[53:07] that everyone is forced to be an
[53:09] investor because we have broken money,
[53:11] that job kind of is is lost in in in in
[53:14] in the crowd and now everyone is like,
[53:16] "Oh, I'm doing 5% a year. I'm doing 50%
[53:19] a year. I'm doing this percent a year."
[53:21] Yeah. You're an genius investor. You you
[53:23] don't realize that your money is lost
[53:26] forever. I I like that. Uh I like that a
[53:28] lot how you how you put it. Yeah. Well,
[53:30] I mean, also it's that's another price
[53:33] signal thing. When you talk about the
[53:34] price signal distortion, investing is
[53:36] another part of that, another branch of
[53:38] that tree, right? If um if we're just
[53:40] investing because our money's broken and
[53:42] we have to like no one's really taking
[53:44] the time to invest in things that they
[53:46] actually believe in, nobody's really
[53:47] digging into P&Ls and balance sheets and
[53:50] finding companies that they really think
[53:51] that they want to see succeed and they
[53:53] want to get behind and they actually
[53:55] believe in. They're just they're just
[53:56] betting on all the companies because
[53:58] their money's busted and they have to.
[54:00] So that's also a very inefficient
[54:02] because when everyone's just betting on
[54:04] every company in the S&P 500, even
[54:06] though seven of them are making money
[54:07] and the far majority of them are not,
[54:09] but nobody even knows what they are.
[54:11] It's as if you like walked into uh like
[54:13] a casino right before March Madness and
[54:16] people are like, "Uh, well, who do you
[54:19] want to bet on?" You're like, "I don't
[54:20] know. I just give me all of them. I'm
[54:22] just going to bet on all 64 teams." Like
[54:24] I just like, have you ever even watched
[54:25] basketball before? It's like no, I don't
[54:26] know but give me give me all the
[54:28] teams. I'm just put my money on
[54:29] everybody. And you're like, that's a
[54:31] pretty inefficient way to allocate
[54:33] capital is just to bet on everyone, no
[54:35] matter how good they are, what their
[54:36] odds of winning are, what it is. And
[54:38] that's what we're doing in the
[54:39] investment world. We're just like, my
[54:41] money's burning. Get it out of my
[54:42] pockets. I'm just going to invest in
[54:44] everything. So, what signal is that
[54:46] sending to the market? We're not sending
[54:48] any economic signal as to which
[54:50] companies are actually being run well,
[54:52] which ones actually have a vision for
[54:53] the future, which ones do we actually
[54:55] believe align with our values. We're
[54:57] just throwing money in there. And it's
[54:58] like so there is no signal in investing
[55:02] now. It's just become this passive just
[55:04] throw money. Everybody throws money. You
[55:07] know, nobody even knows what they hold.
[55:08] Nobody cares what the companies are
[55:10] doing. They're just they they don't
[55:12] necessarily realize it's because their
[55:13] money's broken. But the only reason they
[55:15] do that is because they're just I just
[55:17] need I need something else. Give me
[55:18] something else. Give me every give me
[55:20] every team, you know, give me, you know,
[55:22] give me St. John's. Give me every little
[55:24] guy that made this tournament. It just m
[55:26] it doesn't make any sense from a capital
[55:27] allocation standpoint. And I think that
[55:30] we don't realize how much friction that
[55:32] causes when we're not able to allocate
[55:34] capital appropriately across the board.
[55:37] You end up misallocating it all over the
[55:39] place. And then when they talk about
[55:40] these boom bust cycles and all this
[55:42] misallocation of capital, we're causing
[55:44] it. You know, it's like a a free market
[55:46] is a very efficient allocator of
[55:48] capital. And we don't have a free
[55:50] market, but we keep calling it a free
[55:52] market, which has led everyone to
[55:53] believe that free markets are bad
[55:55] allocators of capital. We don't have
[55:57] one. You know, we we're manipulating the
[55:59] price of capital. That's distorting all
[56:01] the prices. So, the fact that, you know,
[56:03] the economic universe doesn't make a lot
[56:05] of sense. It can't make sense because
[56:07] you took you took the math away and you
[56:09] flipped it and now know like nothing
[56:11] makes sense if you're messing with the
[56:13] actual medium of exchange that all these
[56:15] economic relationships are built on.
[56:17] Yeah. I went into this uh this trap
[56:20] myself. I was a stock pro before Bitcoin
[56:22] and I thought I'm doing really good. I
[56:24] had a YouTube channel and and talked
[56:25] about it and then uh because I actually
[56:28] did well more and more people kept
[56:31] asking me, oh what do you think about
[56:32] that Bitcoin? And that's how basically I
[56:34] got into Bitcoin and then I was like
[56:35] realizing oh I did I did not good
[56:38] because I'm a good investor. I just
[56:41] bought some popular stocks and they went
[56:43] all up because of crazy money printing.
[56:46] Yeah. But yeah, that's uh that's super
[56:48] interesting. Um, one topic before we
[56:50] come to the end we really want to get
[56:51] into with you is uh your definition of
[56:55] freedom and how Bitcoin maybe
[56:59] uh changed your understanding of what
[57:02] freedom actually is. It's Yeah, that's a
[57:05] big question. I think the definition of
[57:06] freedom I think is the ability to do
[57:09] anything you want whenever you want as
[57:12] long as you don't infringe on the
[57:14] freedom of somebody else. So, you know,
[57:15] people could be like, "Oh, yeah. Can I
[57:17] you just go stab a guy in the subway?"
[57:18] You're like, "Well, no, because that is
[57:20] taking freedom away from that guy." So,
[57:22] it's the ability to be completely in
[57:24] charge of your own sovereignty,
[57:26] completely in charge of your own energy
[57:27] and existence within the boundary of you
[57:30] don't actually bump up against anybody
[57:32] else's right to do the exact same thing.
[57:34] So, um I think Bitcoin is perfect for
[57:37] that because Bitcoin is really just it's
[57:40] your energy that you're storing. So when
[57:43] I go to work and I spend my day doing
[57:45] something I don't want to do like
[57:46] against my will, but I get compensated
[57:49] for that lost opportunity of like I want
[57:51] to just go, you know, crack a beer by
[57:53] the river, but instead I go to work and
[57:55] I get compensated for giving that time
[57:57] over and they give me, you know, this
[58:00] money in return. That's for me to save
[58:02] and be like, "Hey, that's they, you
[58:04] know, that's that's cracked beers in the
[58:06] future. I can do that whenever I want.
[58:08] I'm saving it up for the future time.
[58:09] I'll do that some other time." But what
[58:11] Bitcoin is doing is it's kind of um it's
[58:13] kind of aligning the idea of personal
[58:16] body autonomy, sovereignty, and freedom
[58:18] and it's adding all of that energy to
[58:21] that um to that same vessel. So the way
[58:25] I think about Bitcoin is you can become
[58:26] your money. So what makes it truly
[58:29] unconfiscable is in a meta way I can
[58:31] become my money where since it's just
[58:34] held in a mathematical vault that's
[58:37] intangible and nobody can go physically
[58:39] break into that place and take it. The
[58:42] only way I have the only key to it and
[58:44] the only key I have is in my head. It's
[58:46] an intellectually held key. You become
[58:48] your money. So, so not only are
[58:51] you you you are a manifestation of your
[58:54] current energy state where right now I'm
[58:57] in I'm in charge of my body and
[58:59] whatever, but I don't not until now was
[59:02] I able to be in charge of all of the
[59:04] energy I've put forward prior to today.
[59:06] So now I can store all of that energy in
[59:10] my own body vessel too where you cannot
[59:12] take me out of the equation and gain
[59:15] access to all of that energy I've
[59:17] already given over. So it puts you it
[59:20] makes you a completely sovereign
[59:21] economic individual as well. So it takes
[59:24] the idea of body autonomy and it takes
[59:26] the idea of economic autonomy and it
[59:28] just merges them together where just
[59:29] like you said I don't want to die with
[59:31] my Bitcoin. and I want to use it, but uh
[59:34] I could die with my Bitcoin or if
[59:36] someone chooses to take me out of the
[59:38] equation. Before they would, you know,
[59:41] you can show up and you can you can
[59:43] smoke a guy and you can get his house
[59:44] and his wife and his kids and his truck
[59:46] and his all his stuff. Now you can store
[59:49] your economic energy in a place where if
[59:51] you take me out of the equation, you get
[59:53] nothing. So it disincentivizes violence.
[59:56] It brings it brings it way down. It
[59:58] allows you to be completely sovereign.
[60:00] It allows all of the economic energy
[60:02] you've been given to be put into a
[60:04] completely sovereign free place. And
[60:06] then, you know, just like talking about
[60:07] before, when you can do that for
[60:09] yourself, the biggest confiscator of
[60:11] wealth is usually not, you know, just
[60:13] some stickup man on the subway. It's
[60:16] usually the government and it's usually
[60:17] the fact that they're going to print
[60:19] your kids life savings away before they
[60:22] even, you know, get to third grade.
[60:24] Suddenly, that's no longer a possibility
[60:26] either. So it just makes you as free as
[60:29] you can possibly be. And then I think
[60:31] because at least for now um since we
[60:34] live under these kind of democratic
[60:36] republic structures at least in the west
[60:38] if those people are ultimately free then
[60:42] it makes the institutions more
[60:44] accountable and then by design it makes
[60:46] them more free as well because they
[60:48] cannot um they cannot do anything
[60:51] without your permission. So I think it
[60:54] allows we've we've we started free and
[60:56] we drifted way away from being free but
[60:59] if you reempower the individual
[61:01] sovereignty of people I think you you
[61:04] rewire the you know sovereign structure
[61:07] as well. I love that and I hope hope
[61:10] Bitcoin does that for the for the world
[61:13] at least for for many individuals.
[61:15] Really cool. I have I have I have a I
[61:17] have a I have a new question that I
[61:18] didn't ask you last time uh that I ask
[61:21] now every guest of mine and the question
[61:23] is what can we learn from you besides
[61:25] Bitcoin?
[61:26] That yeah that is a good question
[61:27] because um like a lot of Bitcoin nerds
[61:30] out there it takes a lot of my
[61:31] intellectual energy. It's podcast all
[61:33] day. It's books all night. It's YouTube.
[61:35] Uh I would say um
[61:39] uh since it's tied into it and all my
[61:41] studies were probably kind of Bitcoin
[61:43] related when it came to debt and those
[61:44] kind of things. Uh I would say I have a
[61:47] good grasp of that kind of economics.
[61:48] But I've also just been intellectually
[61:50] curious by nature my entire life. And I
[61:54] think um that's probably a common thread
[61:56] that Bitcoiners share is usually they
[61:59] find Bitcoin because they're curious
[62:01] about the world around them. So, um, not
[62:04] like self arandizing, but I'm kind of a
[62:06] jack of all trades. Like I I could teach
[62:08] people how to fly planes. I could teach
[62:10] people how to scuba dive. I could teach
[62:12] people how to shoot guns. I could teach
[62:14] people I'm a EMT. I could teach you how
[62:16] to put a tourniquet on a bleeding arm.
[62:18] So, I've I've kind of just treated life
[62:20] like a bit of an adventure club. So,
[62:23] have a lot of just weird I'm a one of
[62:24] those um jackof all trades, master of
[62:27] none kind of people.
[62:30] And I'm really looking forward uh to
[62:32] this next one. Uh we have Andrew in the
[62:35] in the podcast where the previous guest
[62:37] is asking a question for the next guest
[62:38] without knowing who the next guest
[62:40] is. This I don't know how he came up
[62:43] with that question. Um the question from
[62:45] previous guest is if aliens landed on
[62:48] Earth tomorrow and they asked you to
[62:51] explain Bitcoin using only food
[62:54] analogies, what's your answer? Uh dude,
[62:58] that's that's interesting. I don't know
[63:00] why it would be a food analogy. Um, I
[63:02] think the beauty of that is if aliens
[63:05] landed here, I think they're probably um
[63:08] they're probably of a order of magnitude
[63:11] more intelligent than we are. So, I
[63:13] don't know if they would need me to
[63:14] explain Bitcoin to them. Hopefully
[63:17] hopefully the only reason they got
[63:18] interstellar technology was that they
[63:20] had some form of uh sound cryptographic
[63:24] money themselves that allowed them to
[63:26] progress society to that level of uh
[63:29] capabilities. Um I don't know what the
[63:31] food analogy would necessarily be. Um,
[63:35] unless there's just this idea that, you
[63:37] know, Bitcoin is a meatball sub that I
[63:40] already ate. And, you know, there's no
[63:42] way to separate me from that meatball
[63:44] sub with violence in any way that you
[63:47] would actually want that meatball sub
[63:48] anymore. So, if it's a just a mangled
[63:51] mess in my stomach, yeah, you could try
[63:52] to cut me cut it out of me. But, um, you
[63:55] know, I don't know, maybe these aliens
[63:56] are freaks. Maybe they like eating that
[63:58] kind of meatball sludge. But, it's not
[63:59] like it's the damage is already done.
[64:01] I've already merged with that food. and
[64:04] you cannot take that food without taking
[64:06] me out of the equation as well. I think
[64:08] maybe that would be the best food
[64:09] analogy I could come up with. Um, but I
[64:11] also think I'm I'm a believer of the
[64:13] Stephen Hawking idea that if there are
[64:15] aliens out there, we better hope they
[64:17] don't find us because usually when
[64:18] people just come up on indigenous
[64:20] people, it doesn't really go well.
[64:22] There's not really a example of two
[64:24] species merging in history where one
[64:26] doesn't just end up dominating the other
[64:29] and making them subjugate to their their
[64:31] whims. So, I don't think that would be a
[64:33] friendly interaction, I guess, is the
[64:35] point. If they do find us here, yeah,
[64:37] it's kind of scary to think because if
[64:39] they find us before we find them, they
[64:42] probably are more advanced than us. And
[64:44] if they are more advanced than us, why
[64:47] shouldn't they dominate us? Like, what
[64:49] what incentive do they have to just let
[64:53] us be what what what we are? Um, I mean,
[64:56] we do that with animals, right?
[65:00] I mean, in or or the or the west, right?
[65:02] We landed in the west and we met the
[65:03] Indians and we're like, "Oh, you guys
[65:05] are pretty cool. How about we take
[65:06] everything from you?" You know, like I
[65:09] mean, there's this example of of dogs
[65:11] when when aliens come to to Earth and
[65:14] and see the relationships between humans
[65:17] and dogs, they see one species is uh
[65:21] pooping wherever they want, and the
[65:22] other species is going down on their
[65:25] knees, getting it up, and carrying it
[65:28] for the other one. You're not sure which
[65:30] one is dominating them. Yeah. Yeah.
[65:33] Sidefield bit. Yeah. I like like the one
[65:35] where you're like if you feed a dog, he
[65:36] thinks you're a king, but if you feed a
[65:38] cat, they think they're a king. You
[65:40] know, it's like it's got that same kind
[65:41] of dynamic.
[65:43] I love that. Yeah. Thank you so much,
[65:45] Mike, for for being on the show. Um
[65:46] before I let you go, where can people
[65:48] find you and your show? Uh yeah, man.
[65:50] Happy to do it. Uh I'm the host of the
[65:52] Take Care of Bitcoin podcast. It's a
[65:54] Bitcoin podcast that uh is focused on
[65:57] the Bitcoin newcomer. I let them come on
[65:59] and ask their new new people questions
[66:01] and hopefully be that kind of first rung
[66:03] on that ladder to get people curious
[66:04] about Bitcoin and dig in a little bit.
[66:06] So, uh, it's available anywhere. It's,
[66:09] you know, Apple, Spotify, Fountain, all
[66:12] the all the kind of normal wherever you
[66:13] go to get your podcast, it's probably
[66:14] there. And then I'm on, uh, X or Twitter
[66:18] at TCBcoin. So, if anybody wants to
[66:20] reach out or if anybody's interested in
[66:21] being a guest on the show or knows
[66:23] somebody that might be interested,
[66:24] please hit me up there. Really cool.
[66:26] Thank you so much for being on. Also,
[66:28] thank you so much for everyone that is
[66:29] watching and listening for joining us
[66:31] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
