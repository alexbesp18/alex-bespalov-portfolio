[00:00] if you really wanted to self custody
[00:02] properly and in a secure way buying a
[00:05] hardware will will help you to do that
[00:07] but your knowledge is your knowledge
[00:10] about Bitcoin your knowledge about self
[00:12] custody this is the silver bullet for
[00:15] you to security store your Bitcoin you
[00:17] can just remember words in your head and
[00:19] that's s custody you can never Outlaw
[00:22] that Bitcoin is like the Plan B against
[00:25] those centralized entities when we now
[00:28] see field money as the Titanic of the
[00:32] financial system and like it's the
[00:33] Titanic and it will sink we don't want
[00:35] the Titanic to sink too
[00:37] [Music]
[00:40] quick what did motivate you to to start
[00:44] Keystone what did motivate you to start
[00:46] this this company and and start a okay
[00:49] something more in
[00:50] Bitcoin okay cool cool thank you so much
[00:52] for the for the question I think maybe I
[00:54] can give a quick recap about how I get
[00:57] into Bitcoin how I because that's
[01:00] related how I get into Bitcoin is
[01:02] related to how I started building this
[01:04] company so back in 2009 when I was in
[01:08] college uh around the the Christmas of
[01:11] 2009 it was our job hunting season I was
[01:14] at the last year of my college so I was
[01:17] doing job hunting at that time and I
[01:19] spent a lot of time on the internet and
[01:22] I was a heavy user of Google Reader
[01:24] which is a RSS uh Sub sub subscription
[01:27] Tool uh for users and around Christmas
[01:31] of 2009 my Google Reader was flooded by
[01:34] a lot of Bitcoin stuff and that's the
[01:37] first time I knew Bitcoin 2009 so at
[01:39] that time I didn't but I the the the the
[01:42] biggest regret is that I didn't do
[01:43] anything I didn't do mining I didn't do
[01:45] anything for Bitcoin because I was
[01:46] thinking that this is very cool this is
[01:49] very revolutionary but I was not sure
[01:52] that the consensus could be reached at
[01:54] that time so I was kind of like qu
[01:56] questioning about Bitcoin at that time
[01:59] uh uh so I didn't do anything and then
[02:01] four years later it came to
[02:04] 2013 uh I was running a startup with my
[02:08] two of my best friends uh and they were
[02:11] both graduated from uh the computer
[02:13] science uh uh they they got their
[02:16] computer science master degree in
[02:18] Stanford so they were keeping a close
[02:20] eye on what's happening in the tech
[02:23] world and one day one of them told me
[02:26] that LE you should you should check out
[02:27] this you should check out you should
[02:28] check out Bitcoin that
[02:30] 2013 yeah uh because I think the price
[02:33] goes up from like $10 to $100 at a time
[02:36] so they asked me to check it out and
[02:38] then I checked out Bitcoin I was super
[02:41] surprised that it seems like the the
[02:43] consensus has been reached about Bitcoin
[02:45] everyone's talking about Bitcoin and
[02:47] people are buying Bitcoin so that's the
[02:49] first time I bought my first Bitcoin on
[02:50]  which is another like sad story
[02:55] and then another four years later so my
[02:58] career and my tri
[03:00] with Bitcoin is is also like four years
[03:03] then we have a big change so 2009 I knew
[03:05] Bitcoin 2013 I bought Bitcoin in
[03:09] 2017 at that time I knew I was
[03:12] introduced to one of the biggest so
[03:15] before 2017 I was working on other
[03:17] Hardware products I was working on Dr
[03:20] before uh just the photography and video
[03:24] graphy draw at that time and selling
[03:26] that product worldwide I was working a
[03:28] very popular company at that time uh and
[03:31] I quit that company because my wife was
[03:33] pregnant so at that time I was also
[03:35] looking for my next journey of Hardware
[03:39] so at the end of 2017 I was introduced
[03:41] to one of the biggest miners here in
[03:46] China and he incubated me to make
[03:49] Hardware wet because at that time I have
[03:52] the experience of making Hardware I have
[03:54] the experience of setting a hardware
[03:56] worldwide because you know building
[03:59] Hardware is only part of the journey you
[04:01] you need also to do like uh world
[04:03] distribution logistic fulfillment also
[04:07] uh like Licensing in different countries
[04:10] this kind of thing certification in
[04:12] different countries a lot of stuff so
[04:14] making Hardware is not easy but I have
[04:15] all this experience because I was
[04:17] working in a drwing company for over
[04:19] four years and also I knew a lot about
[04:21] about Bitcoin so I bought Bitcoin really
[04:23] early so uh we knew each other and he
[04:26] thought so that was like the end of the
[04:29] the The Bu Market at the end of 2017 so
[04:32] we started a company we start building
[04:34] Hardware wet so that's like how I get
[04:37] into Bitcoin and how I get into the
[04:39] business of making Hardware wet uh I
[04:42] love it and you mentioned uh when you
[04:44] looked into Bitcoin you saw if there is
[04:47] a consensus or not what do you mean with
[04:50] with Bitcoin reaching a consensus do you
[04:53] mean like market adoption or I mean
[04:56] consensus means like um everyone like
[04:59] recognize the value of Bitcoin because
[05:03] at that time Bitcoin was so
[05:06] revolutionary uh every like the
[05:08] traditional money all those money they
[05:10] are backed by a government right either
[05:14] it's China government or US Government
[05:16] but so I was thinking that okay this
[05:20] money is not backed by any government is
[05:24] this possible will anyone like well a
[05:27] lot of people like Rec the value of this
[05:30] or just some like cyer punk people are
[05:34] like recognizing this the value of
[05:36] Bitcoin so that's what I mean by
[05:38] consensus but not the not the consensus
[05:40] of like mining mechanics this kind of
[05:43] thing do you think that uh we reach that
[05:47] point where we see enough consensus
[05:51] enough adoption of Bitcoin that it's
[05:54] almost just a matter of time till it's
[05:56] fully adopted or are there still some
[05:58] questions in your mind
[06:00] yeah I think in 2009 I was questioning
[06:02] about the how the consensus could be
[06:05] reached and when the consensus could be
[06:06] reached but in 2013 I was kind of sure
[06:10] because you know everyone everyone knew
[06:14] Bitcoin I think the first stage you knew
[06:15] Bitcoin you won't get Bitcoin the
[06:17] meaning of Bitcoin in the first place
[06:19] right uh Satoshi Nakamoto said in the
[06:22] Forum that if you don't understand I
[06:24] want to explain this to you so it takes
[06:26] everyone some time to understand bcoin
[06:29] and to get into Bitcoin and to build
[06:32] Bitcoin so this is my journey and I
[06:35] think everyone takes almost the same
[06:37] Journey it's an interesting approach
[06:39] from Satoshi that he says like uh I
[06:42] don't have the time to to explain it to
[06:44] you do do sometimes I feel like it's
[06:47] it's it's a bad approach because uh we
[06:50] we we should explain we should explain
[06:52] Bitcoin we should explain other people
[06:54] why Bitcoin is so great but then
[06:56] sometimes I have conversations with no
[06:57] coiners and I'm like I can understand
[07:00] why satosi said that like it someone has
[07:03] to do some research on on themselves to
[07:06] actually understand the technology
[07:07] understand everything and we can not
[07:10] force anyone uh to to come to to the
[07:13] conclusion and they will come there
[07:14] anyway so how do you look at it
[07:17] yeah yeah definitely I think you are
[07:19] perfect you're perfectly right everyone
[07:21] will get on this boat sooner or later
[07:25] yeah for me it takes about four years
[07:27] but maybe maybe I think nowadays it be
[07:30] quicker because at that time after 2009
[07:33] I didn't hear anything about Bitcoin
[07:36] it's like totally erased from my from my
[07:40] computer from the thing I'm I'm checking
[07:43] but then suddenly it came back so four
[07:45] years later I think nowadays maybe you
[07:47] see Bitcoin today and next week you will
[07:50] see Bitcoin again and next week in
[07:52] another PB people will talk about
[07:54] Bitcoin again so it will be quicker and
[07:58] quicker for us someone to understand
[08:00] Bitcoin and also we have this kind of
[08:03] interview and podcast for people to
[08:06] understand more about Bitcoin so I
[08:07] really value the opportunity of talking
[08:10] with you to share my journey to share my
[08:13] thinking about Bitcoin about self CTIC
[08:16] yeah thank you again thank you so much
[08:18] yeah I appreciate that my my my mission
[08:21] here on the podcast is like give every
[08:23] bitco stage so we can uh work together
[08:26] and and make this thing happen and the
[08:29] thing is
[08:30] uh I'm already looking forward in 10
[08:32] years when I can in 10 years look back
[08:35] at this those episodes from here and see
[08:38] like what what do what did the people
[08:40] say what did they expect for the future
[08:42] of Bitcoin and how did it actually BL
[08:45] out so this will this will be really
[08:47] really uh great and there let's let's
[08:49] let's come directly to it um what are
[08:52] you doing with with with Keystone it's
[08:54] like a hardware wallet uh and maybe for
[08:56] people that then don't know Keystone uh
[08:58] what is key Keystone doing okay thank
[09:01] you so much uh so in one sentence
[09:04] Keystone is a hardware wallet and we
[09:08] offer a Bitcoin only firmware for our
[09:11] user which means that you buy the
[09:13] product and you can upgrade to bitcoin
[09:15] only firmware and then Bitcoin is the
[09:19] only um like blockchain supported in
[09:22] this device and you can use this device
[09:26] so the biggest difference of this device
[09:29] comparing to other like popular Hardware
[09:33] where in the community is that this is
[09:36] the device and it comes with a 4 inch
[09:39] touch screen so uh we have this 4inch
[09:42] touchcreen designed because we wanted to
[09:46] give the best user experience to the
[09:48] user because we think for the past
[09:51] several years every Hardware wallet is
[09:54] trying to improve the security from a
[09:57] technical perspective but user
[10:00] experience is also part of the security
[10:02] because if you make a product which is
[10:05] hard to use and people may abandon that
[10:08] or if it make you make a hardware wet
[10:10] which is hard hard to use and the user
[10:13] may make human mistakes then they will
[10:15] lose their Bitcoin so that's why we we
[10:19] come up with the 4 inch touchcreen and
[10:22] this is the biggest difference from the
[10:24] phone Factor wise and also at the back
[10:27] of the device you can see there's a
[10:30] camera so another big difference of this
[10:33] device is that we use this camera to
[10:36] scan QR code on the software wallet
[10:40] either it's blue wallet or Sparrow or
[10:43] any other like Bitcoin wallet to scan
[10:45] the QR code to get the information into
[10:49] the device sign the transaction and then
[10:51] show another QR code again and then you
[10:54] can use your your mobile phone your blue
[10:58] wallet on your mobile phone to scan the
[10:59] QR code and broadcast the transaction so
[11:03] in this way we were telling people that
[11:06] we want to
[11:07] create create a totally air gapped way
[11:11] of communication between your Hardware
[11:14] wallet and your software wallet we know
[11:16] that um we are the first one now doing
[11:19] this and later code card and passport
[11:22] they are doing the same thing um but I
[11:25] think code card has the first idea that
[11:27] they use micro SD card to transfer the
[11:30] data which uh allow you to never connect
[11:33] your device to a laptop through USB or
[11:36] through Bluetooth they are the first one
[11:39] to do air gap but we are the first one
[11:41] to do air gap with QR code which makes
[11:44] it much much more easy much much easier
[11:48] for a user to uh scan the QR code rather
[11:52] than use the micd card so this is the
[11:55] main difference of our device and at the
[11:58] back of the device you can can see
[11:59] there's also a fingerprint sensor so
[12:02] with this fingerprint
[12:04] sensor uh you can authenticate your
[12:08] transaction with just a tap of your
[12:10] finger rather than typing your password
[12:14] every time so every time you turn on a
[12:16] device just like iPhone every time you
[12:18] turn on your iPhone your iPhone or you
[12:21] didn't you don't use it
[12:23] for uh a period of time then you need to
[12:26] type your password but after you type
[12:28] your password you can use your face to
[12:31] like unlock your iPhone or authenticate
[12:34] any sensitive like operation on your
[12:37] iPhone so this is the same every time
[12:39] you turn on the device you type in your
[12:41] password and then use your fingerprint
[12:43] to authenticate the transaction if you
[12:45] don't turn it off in this way um because
[12:49] nowadays people are the first of this
[12:52] the first benefit of this fingerprinting
[12:54] sensor is that it makes it easier for
[12:56] people to uh to authenticate transaction
[13:00] the second benefit of this fingerprint
[13:02] sensor is that uh nowadays people are
[13:05] not only using their Hardware wet at
[13:07] home but maybe in some public places
[13:10] like in a cafe or in an airport and in
[13:14] those kind of places there's a lot of
[13:16] like surveillance cameras so then with
[13:19] your fingerprint you won't be caught by
[13:22] those surveillance cameras that your
[13:24] password or any this kind of sensitive
[13:27] information so this is why we have this
[13:29] design so
[13:31] overall we take like security from
[13:34] another perspective rather than just
[13:37] technical security but think about
[13:39] because security is very complicated
[13:41] it's like building a bracket and every
[13:45] piece of the bracket should be not very
[13:47] short so that you can hold more water in
[13:49] the bracket so this is our like design
[13:52] philosophy of the product and uh also
[13:56] another uh interesting part another two
[13:59] interesting part for the security the
[14:01] first is that this device has three
[14:04] secure elements we know that the datest
[14:06] model of code card they have two secure
[14:08] elements we have three different types
[14:10] of secure elements and also we have a
[14:13] self destruction mechanism which means
[14:15] that if a hacker uh stole your device
[14:18] and the falsely open a device to do some
[14:21] hack to the circuit board and this
[14:24] device will be self-destructed which
[14:27] means that it will erase all the
[14:29] recovery phrase or or private key so
[14:32] this is like maybe too many setting
[14:35] points but this is what we have done for
[14:38] the Bitcoin community and we have been
[14:41] in the space for over six years so this
[14:43] is our third generation of device not
[14:45] the first or second the third generation
[14:48] oh really really cool uh I love that
[14:51] you're taking the approach to make it
[14:54] simple and make it user friendly because
[14:57] everyone is used to having like a phone
[15:00] uh and and those other ones are not
[15:03] having those those those displays but
[15:06] the the reality right now for me at
[15:08] least is um most people still don't have
[15:11] self custody like most people hold their
[15:14] like most people don't have Bitcoin but
[15:16] those who have Bitcoin even those have
[15:18] it usually on Exchange they maybe even
[15:21] have it on on an ETF or something like
[15:23] that um why why do you think that most
[15:26] people still don't have a selfcast
[15:30] solution or why they are not using why
[15:33] they are why are they so uh um uh lazy
[15:37] and just keep the Bitcoin on Exchange uh
[15:41] and and what can we do like to to get
[15:43] people do self
[15:45] custody okay I think um for those people
[15:49] I think it's very obvious that they're
[15:52] why they are putting their Bitcoin in
[15:54] those uh centralized exchanges I think
[15:57] just because those exchanges they have
[15:59] better user experience comparing to self
[16:03] custody because if you do self custody
[16:05] at least you need to create create your
[16:08] own recovery phrase and write them down
[16:11] and put them some somewhere safe that's
[16:14] kind of like intuitive for people to do
[16:17] this because imagine you having a bank
[16:21] account you never like write down 24
[16:23] words for your bank account right so
[16:26] this is kind of
[16:27] counterintuitive but but I'm very
[16:30] positive about in the future just like
[16:33] you said maybe in 10 years later let's
[16:35] imagine 10 years later so I was always
[16:39] challenging by my friends who are just
[16:42] putting their Bitcoin in those exchanges
[16:44] they telling me Oh own a hardware wallet
[16:48] doing everything understanding
[16:50] everything it's really hard but I'm
[16:52] really positive I'm really positive to
[16:54] this because just imagine that 10 years
[16:59] later so in the United States or in
[17:03] China almost everyone they can drive a
[17:05] car right driving a car is something not
[17:09] very easy and you need to take some
[17:11] lessons lessons and you need have a
[17:13] license to drive your car maybe in 10
[17:16] years later everyone will be taught that
[17:21] how to use Bitcoin how to manage Bitcoin
[17:23] how to store Bitcoin properly in 10
[17:26] years later I can imagine that so also I
[17:30] was invited to some high schools to do a
[17:33] remote lecture for them about self cust
[17:36] about how to use Keystone these kind of
[17:39] like lessons those are economics lessons
[17:42] in high school in the United States so
[17:45] I'm very very positive about that
[17:47] because this is all about education so
[17:49] people should know that Bitcoin is
[17:51] decentralized and if you own this
[17:54] decentralized assets it doesn't make any
[17:57] sense if you own a decentralized asset
[18:00] in a centralized way it doesn't make any
[18:02] sense right
[18:05] so some people they they put most of
[18:08] their Assets in Bitcoin for those people
[18:11] of course they understand Bitcoin and
[18:12] they'll do self cust it but some people
[18:15] they just take Bitcoin as some kind of
[18:17] investment but even for this kind of
[18:19] investment if you are taking Bitcoin as
[18:21] investment you must be you must be you
[18:24] must see Bitcoin as a diversify your
[18:27] portfolio right if you wanted to
[18:29] diversify portfolio from that
[18:32] perspective it means that you want to
[18:34] diversify your portfolio from those a
[18:36] bunch of
[18:38] centralized like assets diversify using
[18:42] using Bitcoin to diversify those
[18:44] centralized assets then you're are
[18:47] seeing the value of Bitcoin which is a
[18:49] decentralized asset and then if you put
[18:52] that decentralized asset in centralized
[18:54] way it doesn't make any sense so if
[18:57] every people if people are educated in
[18:59] this way and people understand Bitcoin
[19:02] in this way rather than just seeing
[19:04] Bitcoin as maybe the stock of Apple this
[19:07] kind of thing and then you will use the
[19:10] right way to do self custody you will
[19:12] take the hustle of U managing recovery
[19:15] phrase setting up Hardware wallet you
[19:17] need will understand the knowledge about
[19:19] this so I'm very positive about that
[19:21] because just like when I see Bitcoin in
[19:24] 2009 I I didn't think the consensus
[19:26] could be reached so nowadays Maybe some
[19:28] people think okay the consensus of
[19:30] Hardware won't be reached but I'm really
[19:33] positive about that because I've been
[19:34] through the Journey of seeing Bitcoin
[19:38] but don't understand that and then kind
[19:41] of see the consensus and buy Bitcoin and
[19:45] then get my career get my time get my
[19:48] like my all my energy into Bitcoin so I
[19:51] got into this process I'm pretty sure
[19:53] that everyone will has will have his own
[19:57] like Bitcoin journey and and at the end
[19:59] of the day most of people will
[20:01] understand the value of Bitcoin and the
[20:02] value of self
[20:04] custody yeah it's it's it's something uh
[20:08] very true when we have more and more
[20:10] education and more and more adoption of
[20:12] the technology uh S cost will be more
[20:15] more normal is there something that you
[20:18] see where Hardware wallets have to
[20:21] improve like do you see any uh
[20:23] technology uh improvements or anything
[20:26] except of Education that we have to do
[20:29] in in self custody to actually onboard
[20:32] like four billion people five billion
[20:34] people because now it's like a small
[20:36] number like how many people have
[20:38] actually Bitcoin 100 million 200 million
[20:41] 300 million whatever the exact number is
[20:43] but if you want to have like two billion
[20:45] five billion uh where do you see the
[20:48] like the the future of of self custody
[20:51] devices uh in in like five 10 maybe 20
[20:55] years okay uh that's a great question so
[20:59] uh I think right now for
[21:01] Keystone uh it's very if if we only talk
[21:05] about the like maybe five years later
[21:07] about Bitcoin I think about Keystone I
[21:10] think one of the most important thing is
[21:13] that we should decentralize keyone
[21:18] decentralize a hardware wallet what does
[21:21] this mean this means that right now we
[21:25] are like we are the owner of the
[21:28] Keystone brand and we are also
[21:30] manufacturing the Keystone device and we
[21:33] are selling and distributing this device
[21:35] to our end user but in this way we are
[21:39] still like like a centralized entity of
[21:43] making this device right so what I'm
[21:45] thinking about is that maybe five years
[21:48] later or 10 years later we will
[21:52] decentralize this wallet which means for
[21:54] example if you are in the United States
[21:57] you can download
[21:59] all the code and you can download the
[22:01] hardware design you can download
[22:03] everything on GitHub and then you can
[22:07] find some manufacturer to help you
[22:09] easily manufacture this Hardware wet and
[22:12] distribute to your customer in your
[22:15] country because we see that in the
[22:17] future obviously right now people are
[22:19] building walls between China and the US
[22:23] in between like Russia and other
[22:25] countries it's like people don't
[22:27] understand each other so the consensus
[22:29] is like become weaker and weaker in
[22:32] different countries in different races
[22:34] so that's why I'm thinking but but in
[22:37] the Bitcoin world we have a term that
[22:39] code is law right so maybe one day we no
[22:43] longer manufacture this product we are
[22:45] just trying to deliver the code to the
[22:48] community and you can use the code you
[22:50] can use the mechanics design you can use
[22:53] the circular design to produce your own
[22:55] Keystone in your country and resell that
[22:59] to your customer in your country so this
[23:01] is what I'm thinking about decentralize
[23:04] a hardware W and I'm really positive
[23:07] about the future of this and if we come
[23:10] to this future and even Hardware world
[23:13] could be decentralized and then the
[23:15] Bitcoin Community is more decentralized
[23:18] so the more decentralized the better
[23:21] this is what I'm thinking about and I'll
[23:23] be really proud if we achieve that if
[23:25] you are listening to this podcast you
[23:27] might be wondering what is actually the
[23:29] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[23:31] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[23:34] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[23:36] right source and you have to store
[23:38] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[23:40] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[23:42] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[23:45] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[23:47] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[23:48] own token or something like that be on a
[23:51] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[23:54] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[23:57] for that and now now where do you store
[23:59] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[24:01] hardware wallet on a self custody
[24:04] solution where you yourself hold your
[24:07] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[24:10] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[24:13] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[24:15] there back up your seat fras and you are
[24:18] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[24:22] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[24:24] it's an absolutely must have one last
[24:27] thing before we get back back to the
[24:28] video I'm really passionate about
[24:30] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[24:32] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[24:35] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[24:39] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[24:41] conference in whole of Europe for all
[24:44] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[24:46] this place in June for all europees it's
[24:49] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[24:52] Bitcoin Pride conference you basically
[24:53] have to come I will do interviews there
[24:56] and I would love to meet you all there
[24:59] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[25:02] get discounts and use the links down in
[25:04] the description yeah and it's also gets
[25:06] in the focus of open sourcing everything
[25:10] I think the Bitcoin communi is really
[25:12] really like to see open source stuff
[25:14] when they see actually oh I can verify
[25:17] the code I can verify then put it myself
[25:20] together uh really interesting uh a
[25:23] concept uh do you think it it in
[25:26] generally makes sense to to de
[25:29] centralize almost everything and and and
[25:31] companies in general or are there some
[25:35] some things that still make sense also
[25:37] in the future where we have to have a
[25:40] centralized organization around it in
[25:43] generally I think in the future um from
[25:47] my perspective something you will never
[25:50] change in the nature of some centralize
[25:52] the thing because you you still have the
[25:55] government um for me I don't think
[25:59] our bitcoiners we can like fight with
[26:01] those governments right so the
[26:04] government is centralized and then a lot
[26:06] of stuff built upon the government are
[26:09] centralized they have centralized the
[26:11] banks they have centralized like
[26:14] education centralized hospitals still
[26:17] there are something that are centralized
[26:19] but I see like Bitcoin as we always see
[26:23] like Bitcoin is your like Plan B right
[26:26] so Bitcoin is like the Plan B against
[26:28] those centralized entities or
[26:31] centralized people so but I think around
[26:35] Bitcoin everything Bitcoin related I
[26:38] hope everything Bitcoin related should
[26:40] be as decentralized as possible so this
[26:43] is what I'm vising what I'm trying to V
[26:46] in the future and it's a it's a great
[26:48] vision because uh it's it's it's it's
[26:51] the fundamental of everything in Bitcoin
[26:53] not having any centralized organization
[26:57] manipulating uh anything how do you look
[26:59] at at at stuff like the Bitcoin ETF uh I
[27:02] think it was the Bitcoin ETF in America
[27:05] came out now in Hong Kong also uh before
[27:08] there were already Bitcoin ETFs in
[27:11] Canada uh and but now a lot of people
[27:13] like uh scream up in the Bitcoin
[27:17] Community uh because those Bitcoin ETFs
[27:20] have a lot of Bitcoins like the the
[27:22] think the total value of the American
[27:25] Bitcoin ETFs have now reached a million
[27:28] Bitcoin if if I'm I'm if I'm not
[27:30] mistaken but they reach like a really
[27:32] big number of Bitcoins maybe I'm wrong
[27:34] about the exact number but are you
[27:37] concerned about those centralized
[27:41] holders oh that's a great great great
[27:44] question so uh from my
[27:48] perspective uh what I'm seeing Bitcoin I
[27:51] see Bitcoin is a very longterm thing it
[27:55] will last for like a 100 years 200 years
[27:59] or a thousand years if we put Bitcoin or
[28:02] if we put those like ETF in such a
[28:05] longer like time frame this means
[28:08] nothing from this such a long we we can
[28:11] see we can we can say that those
[28:14] centralized controllers of Bitcoin is
[28:16] not good but I think the only Badness of
[28:20] those centralized controller is that
[28:22] they maybe someday they controlled by
[28:24] the government and then they they dump
[28:26] the Bitcoin this kind of thing but if we
[28:28] dump the Bitcoin and but you you see
[28:30] Bitcoin as a 10,000 year thing or even
[28:34] 100,000 year thing you don't care about
[28:36] that it's totally okay because at the
[28:39] end of the day people will do self
[28:41] custody and all those Bitcoins will be
[28:44] owned DEC in a decentralized way which
[28:46] means like individuals everyone own
[28:48] their own Bitcoin and then Bitcoin will
[28:50] become stronger so I don't worry about
[28:54] the Badness of ETF but I'm also like
[28:57] very
[28:58] I see the bright side of the ETF which
[29:01] means that those ETFs areow for example
[29:04] before the
[29:05] ETF my father he doesn't think that
[29:09] Bitcoin is a thing but then ETF comes
[29:11] here he thinks that oh Bitcoin is
[29:14] recognized by the government and oh this
[29:17] is a proper asset maybe he buy some ETF
[29:21] and then he look into Bitcoin he look
[29:23] into those podcast and then he
[29:26] understand that the value of Bitcoin Co
[29:28] and why uh this decentralized thing is
[29:31] so cool and then he maybe get on board
[29:34] into uh self custody of Bitcoin so I see
[29:38] the bright side of the the ETF and uh I
[29:41] don't think the Badness of those ETF
[29:43] will affect Bitcoin if we see Bitcoin in
[29:46] may like almost a something last very
[29:50] very long in the
[29:52] future is uh when you talk about uh
[29:56] Bitcoin lasting extremely long uh do you
[29:59] think Bitcoin could be the final
[30:02] revolution of of money um to be honest
[30:06] to be very honest I don't think so
[30:09] because uh even though you have like
[30:13] lightning network but the price of
[30:16] Bitcoin is going up and down from time
[30:18] to time so it's not very easy to do like
[30:23] uh to so I I don't think Bitcoin is for
[30:27] daily pay
[30:28] and more line words for Bitcoin is some
[30:32] kind of like value St value so this is
[30:37] what I'm thinking of Bitcoin I think in
[30:39] the future maybe uh a normal people he
[30:43] will have like 50% of Assets in Bitcoin
[30:46] and then he will have some US dollars to
[30:49] do daily payment or even US dollar
[30:52] stable coin to do daily payment so this
[30:55] is what I'm thinking about the future um
[30:58] I I don't think Bitcoin and also I value
[31:00] Bitcoin so much I don't I see using
[31:03] Bitcoin as setting my Bitcoin so I
[31:06] really want don't do that I really don't
[31:08] want to do that yeah it's fascinating
[31:11] for me because honestly we have those
[31:14] main layer restrictions like there will
[31:17] be maximum maybe five or 10 million
[31:21] institutions or persons that will ever
[31:22] be able to like uh on a monthly basis
[31:27] actually transact
[31:28] on the base layer because the other
[31:30] people will just be priced out at some
[31:32] point I don't know what the exact number
[31:33] is it's hard to figure out but I spoke
[31:35] with some people also like Wicket was on
[31:37] the podcast who was directly really deep
[31:39] in the utxo management side of things
[31:42] and he's saying five to 10 million um
[31:45] institutions or people uh could uh
[31:49] transact on the base layer of Bitcoin
[31:52] and everything else has to move up on an
[31:54] ETF on a layer two on lightning fent on
[31:57] all those things so the base layer will
[32:00] definitely never be used as as a daily
[32:02] payment uh uh thing it will have more
[32:06] used as like a big settlement thing
[32:09] between maybe Banks between other
[32:12] institutions uh and then is the question
[32:15] like can can Bitcoin ever be money on a
[32:19] second or third layer where there is
[32:21] Bitcoin underneath it somewhere but it's
[32:24] more like a gold Noe from earlier where
[32:27] we have to use dollar but there's gold
[32:29] connected to it like it was from 100
[32:30] years ago I don't know I have no clue
[32:33] maybe governments come in and back their
[32:36] currency again with Bitcoin like 20%
[32:38] Bitcoin is underneath the currency uh I
[32:43] 100% or I'm I'm fairly certain that as
[32:47] long as I live there will always be
[32:50] government issued
[32:51] money uh but it would be great to have a
[32:55] future where it is not like that and and
[32:59] it would be amazing to see there are
[33:01] some bitcoiners that think like oh in
[33:02] the next 10 years government issue money
[33:04] will be gone I'm not one of them uh but
[33:07] I would celebrate
[33:09] it yeah but it would be would be
[33:12] interesting and there's one more aspect
[33:14] to it that is really interesting when we
[33:17] now see fat money as the Titanic of uh
[33:23] of the financial system and like it's a
[33:25] Titanic and it will think we don't want
[33:28] the Titanic to sync too quick because if
[33:31] it sinks too quick people don't have an
[33:34] option or I don't have the time to get
[33:36] out of the live raft so I think it's not
[33:38] a good thing if feat currencies go away
[33:41] too quickly like in the next five 10
[33:43] years because too many uh this would be
[33:47] just a way too big of a crisis and it
[33:50] would be really hard to to deal with
[33:52] with that on on a broad scale as as I
[33:56] think but the question is really
[33:58] interesting if Bitcoin ever can ever be
[34:01] daily transaction money on a global
[34:04] scale because right now we are not there
[34:07] yet technology LI or that like we are we
[34:10] could not do it on bitcoin uh but but
[34:13] maybe in 200 years I don't know uh I use
[34:16] bit for savings
[34:17] yeah
[34:19] yeah definitely yeah on on that uh note
[34:23] maybe uh with with with main layer being
[34:26] restricted do do do do you think uh or
[34:29] are you um looking forward to any Layer
[34:32] Two Solutions or are you uh uh making
[34:37] also for for Keystone any advancements
[34:40] for like maybe lightning uh in
[34:43] integration or do you any any other
[34:45] Layer Two Integrations for Bitcoin where
[34:48] we have like self- custody layer tws uh
[34:52] or any anything like that because of
[34:54] this restrictions that we probably run
[34:57] ran into at some point with with the
[34:59] Bitcoin main
[35:00] layer oh um I think for From kyone
[35:04] perspective because Keystone we're just
[35:06] building a hardware wallet and we're
[35:09] integrating Keystone with other software
[35:11] wet just like I mentioned for blue
[35:13] wallet
[35:14] Sparrow uh and other software wet so
[35:19] from K Kone perspective uh let's let's
[35:22] take lightning Network as a example uh
[35:25] for lightning Network
[35:28] uh it if you wanted to do like Landing
[35:31] Network payment and send some Bitcoin or
[35:34] sets to other people through Landing
[35:36] Network kstone won't be involved in
[35:39] those kind of scenario because you just
[35:41] use software to do that but there are
[35:43] only one scenario that if you want to
[35:45] use lightning Network and you need that
[35:48] with Bitcoin which is setting up a new
[35:51] lightning channel that needs Keystone to
[35:53] sign the transaction and after that you
[35:57] can only only you you only need your
[35:59] software Willet to do this kind of quick
[36:00] payment and also in those scenario like
[36:03] quick payment it doesn't make sense that
[36:05] you use a hardware water to scan twice
[36:07] to sign a transaction and broadcast that
[36:10] it doesn't make sense so and also
[36:13] Landing work network doesn't require
[36:14] Keystone to sign every transaction but
[36:16] just the first transaction to set up the
[36:18] lighting Channel and we support
[36:21] that yeah I love that a lot it's it's
[36:24] really fascinating to see where where
[36:25] the technology uh will go um a little
[36:29] bit on the regulatory front and it's
[36:33] it's different for like each country
[36:34] it's different for each jurisdiction but
[36:37] uh are you at all afraid that
[36:41] governments might ban self- custody or
[36:44] might ban holding Bitcoin in their in in
[36:47] their own uh thing and they like oh no
[36:50] it's way too unsecure you should have it
[36:52] on Exchange yeah I think that's against
[36:55] the human rights right I don't think
[36:57] government will or if the government w't
[37:00] do that we can elect them down or elect
[37:03] him down I don't think that's possible
[37:05] it's human rights it's just like you are
[37:07] only like a pen you're only you're only
[37:10] a notebook or something yeah so I don't
[37:13] think that's that would be possible yeah
[37:17] yeah I hope you're right and and I think
[37:19] also that that it is like that there was
[37:22] some uh the EU was giving some law um
[37:27] suggestion
[37:28] and they they backed up till now like
[37:30] they they rrit it and they backed up a
[37:33] little bit but they were talking about
[37:35] un hosted wallets as self- custody
[37:38] Solutions uh and I'm like no it's like
[37:41] an un hosted wallet is just self Cy like
[37:44] you don't have to do that and so I I'm
[37:47] not concerned uh at all uh but there I I
[37:52] was like maybe they try something in the
[37:54] medium term like long term it's it does
[37:56] not matter at all will always have self
[37:58] custody because what is self custody you
[38:00] can have self custody with your head
[38:03] like you can just remember words in your
[38:05] head and that's self custody H you can
[38:07] never Outlaw that so that's uh really
[38:11] really cool um perfect then uh one other
[38:15] question that that I have do you have
[38:17] any advice for for bitcoiners like if
[38:20] you if because you most people that
[38:22] listen to my podcast they they they are
[38:24] bitcoiners some of them work in Bitcoins
[38:27] some of them don't work in Bitcoin some
[38:29] of them have a small uh uh investment do
[38:33] you have any general advice uh you would
[38:36] like to give to the
[38:38] bitcoiners okay uh thank you so much
[38:40] that's a great question so from my
[38:43] perspective as I'm making Hardware wet
[38:46] so if I give advice usually I I'm giving
[38:49] advice about security about how to store
[38:53] your Bitcoin more securely uh so my
[38:57] advice actually I've been sharing this
[39:00] advice almost in every podcast which is
[39:04] if you really wanted to do self cust
[39:07] properly and in a secure way buying a
[39:11] hardware Willet will help you to do that
[39:14] but buying a hardware wallet and using a
[39:16] hardware wallet is not your s bullet for
[39:20] that but your knowledge is your
[39:23] knowledge about Bitcoin your knowledge
[39:25] about self custody this is the like
[39:29] silver bullet for you to securely store
[39:32] your Bitcoin so this is like my timate
[39:36] suggestion or advice for bitcoiners to
[39:38] securely store your Bitcoin you need to
[39:41] learn basically you need to learn about
[39:44] recovery phrase you need to learn about
[39:45] pass phrase you need to learn about
[39:48] Shamir backup you need to learn about
[39:52] the schemes of private key public key
[39:55] and Bitcoin address and you need to
[39:57] learn about uh using like a new address
[40:01] for every time you receive some new
[40:03] Bitcoin this kind of also privacy
[40:06] related knowledge which is also highly
[40:08] related to security this is and how to
[40:13] buy Bitcoin in a like on a P2P Market to
[40:16] protect your privacy these are the most
[40:19] important thing from my
[40:21] perspective uh I love that and uh
[40:24] bitcoiners uh that are coming in uh they
[40:27] have a long way to go to go to this uh
[40:31] where to buy Bitcoin uh how to actually
[40:34] secure them uh properly so like there's
[40:37] a lot of things to to to take in
[40:39] consideration and education is key and
[40:42] then and I hope I do yeah okay job on my
[40:45] podcast bringing all those intelligent
[40:47] people on and getting them educated on
[40:49] that uh and another thing that I'm also
[40:52] really passionate always about about
[40:54] that one question because bitcoiners are
[40:56] extreme
[40:57] interesting people they are doing a lot
[40:59] of things and they are curious because
[41:02] we are so early so we are the early
[41:03] adopters of a technology uh so we tend
[41:07] to be uh really curious about stuff so
[41:10] my question uh before we end the in the
[41:13] podcast is what are you currently
[41:16] passionate about uh or learning deeply
[41:18] about besides
[41:20] Bitcoin oh besides Bitcoin that's a
[41:24] great question so I think nowadays I
[41:28] read some books but all those books
[41:30] they're just about management because
[41:33] our company are growing is growing
[41:35] really fast we almost double the size of
[41:39] company of the in this year and there
[41:42] are different new members get into the
[41:44] company I need to actually like two
[41:47] years ago I was quite active on Twitter
[41:49] but nowadays I'm like less and less
[41:51] active on Twitter because I spend most
[41:53] of time for managing the company for
[41:56] about onard boting new employees into
[41:58] the company uh and also for how to build
[42:02] our product better so nowadays I think
[42:04] aside for Bitcoin um I'm also I meet my
[42:08] Bitcoin friends uh like on a weekly
[42:10] basis I also meet with other
[42:12] entrepreneurs or other people who are
[42:14] running startups on a weekly basis just
[42:17] talk about how to better manage your
[42:19] startup and the for a company making
[42:22] Hardware it's also more diff different
[42:25] because you have a lot of employees
[42:27] they're working remotely so these are
[42:30] also very challenging for me that's
[42:33] where I spend most of my time on maybe
[42:35] it's a boring answer but this is like my
[42:38] life what's my life like in in
[42:41] allay it's absolutely not boring because
[42:44] it's it's it's reality and and if you
[42:46] have a great company which is also
[42:48] growing fast and maybe do you do you
[42:50] have a twice for people starting their
[42:53] own company right now in in Bitcoin
[42:56] they're doing maybe they have some
[42:58] technology maybe they are staring some
[43:00] content things like whatever they doing
[43:02] but do you have any advice for like
[43:04] young entrepreneurs uh or coming up
[43:06] people that are also starting a company
[43:08] now oh that's a great question um so
[43:13] from my perspective um I think uh one of
[43:17] the most uh
[43:20] like good advice or like the best thing
[43:25] our company has done or or uh the best
[43:29] decision we have done I think what
[43:31] really important is
[43:33] focus this is really important you can
[43:36] see that from Kon perspective uh we've
[43:39] been in the space for over six years and
[43:42] in the first three and a half years we
[43:44] will dedicate to
[43:45] Bitcoin in the first three and a half
[43:47] years and we will also dedicated to
[43:50] Hardware what itself rather than making
[43:52] our own software wallet like Ledger
[43:55] they're making their Hardware and also
[43:57] the their software wet but I think the
[44:01] the right decision the best and the the
[44:04] definitely the right decision we made
[44:06] was that we really wanted to focus on
[44:08] something focus on Bitcoin in the first
[44:10] place and focus on Hardware in the first
[44:13] place and even even like in the very of
[44:17] the very first generation of Keystone
[44:19] Hardware where we were focusing on the
[44:21] miners actually they're also a small
[44:24] group of bitcoiners they're miners we
[44:27] focus on them because they usually have
[44:30] tons of Bitcoins and they are extremely
[44:33] paranoid about their bit Bitcoin so
[44:36] because you focus on them and they will
[44:38] tell you what kind of feature they want
[44:41] they will tell you that why they are not
[44:43] satisfied with Ledger they have lot of
[44:45] insights and then you can build your
[44:47] product upon those insights but if we
[44:51] don't focus and then we won't GA those
[44:53] insights and when we we won't build uh
[44:56] like for example uh we made the decision
[45:00] to use QR code because I interviewed a
[45:03] lot of miners at that time and they told
[45:05] me that the most anxious time when
[45:09] they're using nature was first they're
[45:13] typing their cover phas or writing down
[45:15] their cover phas that's the first
[45:17] anxious most anxious time the second Mo
[45:19] most anxious time is when they're
[45:21] plugging their leder into their laptop
[45:24] because they don't know what is
[45:27] transferring in the USB cable right they
[45:30] don't know what information is getting
[45:32] into their laptop what information is
[45:33] getting into their Hardware will it
[45:36] they're totally blind it's not
[45:38] transparent and then it comes up I came
[45:41] up with the idea that I told my team
[45:44] that transparency brings trust if you're
[45:48] not open source if you're are not
[45:50] transparent and then you need to spend
[45:53] tons of money to do those kind of
[45:55] propaganda marketing stuff to make
[45:58] people trust you but if you're open
[46:00] source you are transparent with QR code
[46:02] then it's much easier for you as a
[46:05] newcomer to build trust with the
[46:07] customers so I I GA all those insights
[46:10] because I I strictly focus on bitcoin I
[46:13] strictly focus on the miners at that
[46:15] time that's why it's much easier for you
[46:17] to build a right product rather than
[46:20] building something that has a lot of
[46:23] features but not all the features are
[46:25] needed by the people so so this is my
[46:28] advice uh for example if you want to do
[46:31] a content creator uh for example I have
[46:33] a friend who did who started from
[46:36] Bitcoin multi so he was a content
[46:40] creator he strictly focused on bitcoin
[46:43] multi he want to tell the community that
[46:45] why you should use it Bitcoin multi and
[46:47] what are the like pros and cons of
[46:50] Bitcoin mulic and what are the tips for
[46:53] setting up your own Bitcoin mic and what
[46:56] kind of H is the best for Bitcoin
[46:58] Mountain what Hardware will it is the
[47:00] worst for Bitcoin Mountain so he talk
[47:02] about Bitcoin Mountain all the time and
[47:06] then it's very easy for him to uh to be
[47:10] known by the community because there's a
[47:12] clear image of him which is a b m
[47:17] advocate so this is my suggestion no
[47:19] matter what you do just focus on the
[47:21] thing you are best at and focus on thing
[47:24] and try to GA insights from everywhere
[47:26] and polish your product either it's a
[47:28] how or it's a YouTube channel
[47:32] anything I love it thank you for for
[47:34] that that was really really good um we
[47:36] have a endro in the podcast where the
[47:38] previous guest is asking a question for
[47:40] the next guest without knowing who
[47:42] actually the next guest is uh which is
[47:44] always interesting to see uh and the the
[47:48] question is really an an interesting one
[47:50] I had to think about that a little bit
[47:52] um the question for you is if everything
[47:55] unfolds As You Are hoping what is the
[47:58] one thing that will be different in five
[48:00] years sorry what's the question would
[48:03] you repeat it again uh if everything is
[48:06] running as you are hoping so if
[48:08] everything is uh unfolding as you hoping
[48:10] in the next five years what is the one
[48:13] thing that will be different in that
[48:15] world oh that's
[48:18] interesting the first idea came into my
[48:21] mind is that maybe five years later
[48:25] every Bitcoin every Bitcoin will only a
[48:27] hardware wet that's what I'm thinking
[48:29] about and that's good for Bitcoin that's
[48:31] good for Bitcoin and good for
[48:33] Keystone that that would be great uh if
[48:36] everyone has a self- custody hardw
[48:38] wallet and every Bitcoin is like you
[48:40] have to have a hard wallet you have to
[48:42] have self custody uh that that that's a
[48:45] future I would like to live in yeah way
[48:48] I guess okay perfect and thank you for
