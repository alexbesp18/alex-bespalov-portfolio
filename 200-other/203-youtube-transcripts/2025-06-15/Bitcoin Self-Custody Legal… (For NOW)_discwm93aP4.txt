[00:00] people get mad when I say this online
[00:02] and they say well oh you can't shut down
[00:04] self- custody that is true but what you
[00:07] can do is say this is illegal and if we
[00:09] know that you're doing it we're going to
[00:10] put you in jail that when we talk about
[00:12] Bitcoin as Freedom money we're really
[00:15] referring to bitcoin that has not been
[00:17] kyc that's not controlled by an
[00:20] institution or fully traceable by the
[00:22] government so that we can use Bitcoin in
[00:25] the way that it was always intended to
[00:27] be used if we all abandon our home
[00:29] countries there will be nowhere else to
[00:31] go quite frankly I don't really care if
[00:33] they buy Bitcoin or not I think there's
[00:35] a significant case to be made that it's
[00:37] better if they don't because Bitcoin is
[00:39] for us right we don't need to empower
[00:41] the governments let's shrink them and
[00:44] move
[00:45] [Music]
[00:49] on what has changed in the last year for
[00:52] Bitcoin but also for freedom in general
[00:55] and especially with with with the focus
[00:57] on America yeah that's a good question a
[01:00] lot has
[01:01] changed and you know there's there's
[01:04] kind of two different conversations like
[01:06] the straightforward conversation about
[01:09] what has changed immediately and then I
[01:11] think there's a secondary conversation
[01:12] to be had about like are we really
[01:15] changing anything longterm or are we
[01:18] maybe secretly ushering in you know some
[01:20] sort of like dystopian future which a
[01:23] lot of people talk about um but I think
[01:27] for the time being almost everything has
[01:30] changed in a positive way and we've made
[01:34] a huge step forward to save Freedom uh
[01:39] perhaps globally and I I know it kind of
[01:42] sounds crazy but it was an interesting
[01:46] experience for me coming out in support
[01:49] of trump and encouraging people to vote
[01:52] and there were definitely like ups and
[01:55] downs to that and one of the most
[01:57] interesting things that I didn't really
[02:00] expect was for a lot of foreigners who
[02:03] I'm meeting and interacting with at
[02:06] events encouraging me and and saying
[02:10] like cuz I would you say like well you
[02:12] know if it doesn't work out and and
[02:14] America becomes
[02:16] communist um we can move to some of
[02:19] these other places right like there's
[02:21] always we like we we met in prag and I
[02:24] think Prague is an incredible place I'm
[02:26] still a fan of El Salvador I used to
[02:28] live in Dubai and so the attitude of the
[02:31] people full of apathy who want to tell
[02:33] you don't go vote don't be involved was
[02:35] always like oh just flee go somewhere
[02:37] else and so I'm always weighing all
[02:39] these factors right but the thing that I
[02:42] didn't expect was so many people who are
[02:44] not American citizens to be so concerned
[02:48] about America saving freedom and I think
[02:51] this really highlights the fact that in
[02:53] many people's eyes the last stronghold
[02:56] of Freedom globally is in the United
[02:58] States and if we lose it here we sort of
[03:01] lose it everywhere and so the United
[03:04] States serves as this model of Freedom
[03:07] not only Free Speech but you know free
[03:10] ideas the the very concept of debate and
[03:14] disagreement um we see people in the
[03:16] unit in the UK being like arrested for
[03:19] memes and other places for wrong think
[03:21] and
[03:22] without um the United States remaining
[03:26] free the Overton window sort of shifts
[03:28] into a place that is is completely lost
[03:33] and so you know I I never felt like
[03:36] Trump was going to be this magic hero
[03:39] but I did think he was a profoundly
[03:41] better option than the AL alternative
[03:44] and I don't know that everyone really
[03:49] comprehended how bad the alternative had
[03:51] gotten there's like a normaly bias a lot
[03:54] of people were like oh you're so
[03:56] dramatic like America is not ushering in
[03:58] communism um but we were you know and we
[04:03] had political prisoners and we had very
[04:07] very uh serious political Warfare
[04:09] happening in all different branches of
[04:12] our government the state of things you
[04:14] know really couldn't be overstated and
[04:17] so the stakes were really high
[04:20] and I'm glad that we saved them I don't
[04:24] know that that saves America or
[04:27] freedom forever we have to this is a
[04:31] battle that we have to continue to fight
[04:33] both in the United States and globally
[04:35] but I think we had a huge win and I'm
[04:38] happy to celebrate that and I think this
[04:41] gives us a few years to build new tools
[04:45] to empower ourselves in the future if
[04:47] things do slide back towards um
[04:51] communist Global
[04:54] tyranny I mean this is uh like the
[04:56] freedom aspect you always have to keep
[04:58] fighting for I I think there's like
[05:00] never the period of time where I'm like
[05:03] okay now we can lay back and freedom
[05:05] will always Prevail if if we if we slip
[05:08] up um there there will be Communists
[05:11] coming up there will socialists coming
[05:12] up and uh and they will take it away and
[05:15] then and that's like the the the circle
[05:17] of life the cycles of of of Life
[05:19] basically uh and it's really interesting
[05:21] what happens with with Trump with with
[05:24] Doge not the not the coin but the uh
[05:28] Department government efficiency
[05:31] something like that um and overall
[05:33] government cutting government spending
[05:36] is also in Europe now uh Germany uh new
[05:40] elected uh Minister uh Merz is is
[05:43] talking about that they have to cut down
[05:45] government spending a lot uh Austria is
[05:48] doing it currently they're really going
[05:50] by we also in Austria have now instated
[05:53] uh first time ever a state Secretary for
[05:57] uh cutting down government spending this
[06:00] was never there in history and we have
[06:01] it now in Austria actually I I'm not fan
[06:04] of the Austrian government but there's
[06:07] some positive aspect that they got the
[06:09] that the government spending has to be
[06:10] cut down so it does feel like something
[06:15] clobal something like actually is is
[06:17] kind of moving and and I like what you
[06:20] said of like of course we can flee and
[06:23] there are a lot of Germans that moved to
[06:25] El Salvador Dubai like all those places
[06:28] uh but I kind of like Austria and I kind
[06:30] of want to keep fighting for my home
[06:32] country as as long as possible like I
[06:34] don't I don't want to just flee because
[06:36] it gets a little bit difficult like I I
[06:38] I I want to fight for for the home
[06:41] country and and I do encourage like also
[06:43] like Americans like if if a country like
[06:46] if all the good people of a country
[06:48] leave like then then the fight is lost
[06:50] but if the good people stay and like
[06:52] actually keep fighting for it then maybe
[06:54] they have a chance so so there's like a
[06:56] value in that I think yeah I agree with
[06:59] that and you know if we abandon if we
[07:03] all abandon our home countries there
[07:05] will be nowhere else to go you know
[07:07] nowhere is perfect uh we see some new a
[07:12] new piece of the conversation happening
[07:13] in El Salvador with the IMF agreements
[07:16] and I you know when I was in Dubai I got
[07:18] lots of uh there were lots of arguments
[07:22] about well Dubai is not free like what
[07:24] kind of an idiot are you because you
[07:25] think it's free in Dubai and so every
[07:27] you know nowhere is perfect everywhere
[07:29] has its challenges and I think you know
[07:32] your conclusion is is very I agree
[07:35] completely with your conclusion that we
[07:37] need to stay in fight and that means
[07:40] being involved and this this apathy has
[07:44] developed where people are like I don't
[07:46] want to be involved in politics and I
[07:47] was very much um guilty of that but the
[07:52] you know what we've seen and I really
[07:54] started like leaning into this during Co
[07:57] is how much politics do matter whether
[07:59] you care or not whether you want to be
[08:01] involved or not politics is going to be
[08:04] involved in your life and so there were
[08:06] just several things that happened to
[08:09] me with covid and then working in the
[08:12] Bitcoin industry and seeing how
[08:14] aggressive the previous administration
[08:17] was being in shutting down the industry
[08:20] um and I I was not going to give up and
[08:24] not fight you know I'm just not capable
[08:26] of that so how do you see it's Trump and
[08:30] and the Bitcoin what he announced on
[08:33] Sunday like almost a shitcoin reserve
[08:35] but now how Alik seems to kind of steer
[08:39] the ship in a a little bit of a better
[08:41] Direction yeah so my my views on this
[08:45] are not super popular a bunch uh amongst
[08:48] like the Purity the hardcore Purity
[08:50] Bitcoin Maxes um and I consider myself a
[08:54] Bitcoin Maxi but also a realist and
[08:58] there is is a a massive divide between
[09:05] what bitcoiners on bitcoin
[09:08] Twitter know
[09:11] and uh I don't even want to say believe
[09:14] but really know as fact and like what's
[09:18] happening with normies and and how much
[09:20] of a divide there is between the the
[09:24] understanding the education that's
[09:25] needed the regulations the way that
[09:28] everything is managed um and so to me
[09:33] these things are not as black and white
[09:36] like I always knew that if we were going
[09:40] to save everything it was going to be
[09:42] with incremental improvements there was
[09:44] no chance that someone was just going to
[09:46] come in and say like with decree you
[09:49] know you're you're all good you're safe
[09:51] Bitcoin is amazing uh there's no capital
[09:54] gains you know like that's a a wish list
[09:57] that will take years to achieve um and
[10:03] so I have to say like all of the
[10:06] coining all of the nonsense like all of
[10:08] these things I are overplayed in my
[10:11] opinion they will play out Bitcoin will
[10:13] win and to me it's a matter of like lack
[10:18] of understanding from normies about how
[10:20] bad it really was we had finsen in our
[10:24] offices for months during the Biden
[10:27] Administration I'm not sure if we
[10:28] discussed this last time um I'm not sure
[10:30] if it had happened there was a period of
[10:32] time where I couldn't discuss it yet you
[10:35] know um I I was saying a lot of stuff on
[10:39] Twitter like I think that this is what
[10:40] they're trying to do and in fact it I
[10:45] knew that that was what they were trying
[10:47] to do because they were in our offices
[10:49] arguing about it right and so they
[10:52] wanted to make self- custody illegal
[10:56] they wanted basically to regulate the
[10:59]  out of this industry and kick all
[11:02] the Bitcoin and crypto companies out of
[11:04] the United States we saw the beginning
[11:06] of the success of that with a lot of the
[11:09] you know the wallets that left and all
[11:11] these companies saying if you're an
[11:12] American citizen you can't be in the
[11:13] United States so it's it's a long-winded
[11:16] answer to say like this is not only the
[11:18] better of two less than ideal situations
[11:22] this is actually like we are in a
[11:25] profoundly good place compared to where
[11:28] we were let alone where we were going
[11:31] and I'm happy about that you know is it
[11:34] perfect no like am I going to be hugely
[11:37] disappointed if the government uses our
[11:42] money to buy
[11:44] nonsensory of course and I'm still
[11:46] hopeful that that's not what happens um
[11:50] and I don't want to say categorically
[11:52] that I don't really care but to some
[11:54] extent I don't really care because I
[11:56] still have a job I still have a a team
[11:59] of developers that we can go back and
[12:02] start building new products instead of
[12:04] all losing our jobs and there are no
[12:06] longer Regulators in our offices trying
[12:09] to dictate how we can and cannot do that
[12:12] so to me that's such a big win I'm going
[12:15] to take that for now and just hope that
[12:18] Trump continues his Bitcoin journey and
[12:21] more and more politicians continue their
[12:24] Bitcoin Journeys and maybe in 2028 we'll
[12:27] get a hardcore bitcoiner who really
[12:29] understands things um but going from
[12:33] where we are we were to where we are now
[12:36] there's nothing but celebration from me
[12:40] and it's it's really cool it's also like
[12:43] um I mean bitcoiners and I think freedom
[12:47] maximalist in general they they want to
[12:49] kind of just be kept alone and the fact
[12:52] that there's not someone coming in and
[12:55] uh get getting into the business that
[12:57] alone is a win and if they for me uh
[13:02] America buying Bitcoin is anyways a
[13:05] cherry on top like like right even if
[13:07] they don't do it like like I want more
[13:09] Bitcoin like exactly who cares if
[13:12] America has more Bitcoin Americans might
[13:14] care maybe the administration cares but
[13:17] especially as a non-american I'm like
[13:19] like I want me to have more Bitcoin my
[13:21] family have more Bitcoin yeah Bitcoin is
[13:24] for the people not for the government
[13:26] right and so Trump and his crypto people
[13:31] um have stopped the assault on the
[13:33] industry and so we are free to build and
[13:36] educate and do whatever we want right
[13:38] for now and so that's a huge win um and
[13:42] yeah quite frankly I don't really care
[13:43] if they buy Bitcoin or not I think
[13:45] there's a significant case to be made
[13:47] that it's better if they don't because
[13:49] Bitcoin is for us right we don't need to
[13:52] empower the governments let's shrink
[13:54] them and move on absolutely by the way I
[13:59] I don't know about the administration of
[14:02] of the of government and stuff like that
[14:04] but who came into office finac is is
[14:06] like a Financial Security like a police
[14:07] or something yeah basically it's the um
[14:11] the financial police so finen is um a a
[14:16] department under the Department of
[14:18] Treasury and this is the department it's
[14:22] one of the largest uh chunks of the US
[14:24] government and they
[14:27] regulate um they they do all of the
[14:30] regulation of money and you know
[14:34] regulator all of the regulations around
[14:36] money and finance and the intersection
[14:39] with tech it it all falls under them
[14:43] and there's a post I'll have to pull up
[14:46] a post that I made examining the budgets
[14:50] of like the IRS finen cftc the
[14:54] Department of Treasury Department of
[14:56] Treasury is this massive massage massive
[15:00] um piece of the federal government and
[15:03] so they're the ones that are responsible
[15:06] for
[15:08] implementing um the BSA the bank secrecy
[15:11] act all of the AML the global AML laws H
[15:17] that require that we kyc you know
[15:20] there's KYB and kyt being built into all
[15:23] these different systems that people
[15:24] don't even know about this all comes
[15:26] down from the Department of Treasury and
[15:29] finsen is their like enforcement arm so
[15:33] they they were basically just looking
[15:35] for a reason to either fine us or shut
[15:38] us down I mean that's what they do so
[15:42] they wanted to shut down self custody
[15:44] under the Biden Administration and that
[15:46] stopped with the Trump election that is
[15:50] the path that they were on um and
[15:53] there's a lot of supporting regul rules
[15:57] and regulation that was out there and
[16:00] people get mad when I say this online
[16:02] and you know because they say well oh
[16:04] you you can't shut down self- custody
[16:08] and that is true but what you can do is
[16:12] say this is illegal and if we know that
[16:14] you're doing it we're going to put you
[16:15] in jail you can
[16:17] say if you buy your Bitcoin on an
[16:21] exchange you are only allowed to send it
[16:24] off of The Exchange to a wh labeled
[16:27] address that we know who controls it and
[16:31] that was how they were going to do it by
[16:32] the way um so there's these little tiny
[16:39] pieces that can be controlled you know I
[16:43] mean if if your bank doesn't want you to
[16:48] buy pizza sounds absurd right all they
[16:51] have to do is make a list of pizza
[16:53] stores and say you're not allowed to
[16:56] transact with this list of vendors
[16:59] and guess what how do you the only way
[17:01] to get pizza is Black Market pizza but
[17:03] by and large becomes very difficult to
[17:05] get pizza right and so the government is
[17:08] very creative they're not that smart but
[17:10] they're very creative and um when they
[17:12] want to shut something down they can and
[17:16] so you know of course there is always a
[17:19] way and of course people who are highly
[17:23] Technical and hellbent on getting their
[17:27] coins into self- custody or or are
[17:28] already having them there and not
[17:30] complying with future registra
[17:32] regulation of course they were always
[17:34] going to be able to do that but the
[17:36] those were not the people that I was
[17:38] speaking to right I'm talking
[17:40] about everybody else I'm talking about
[17:43] your parents your family your grandmas
[17:46] your friends that work in other
[17:48] industries that are are not that
[17:50] technical who are just trying to save in
[17:53] money that's not inflated away into
[17:55] Oblivion these people are not going to
[17:59] you know take the extremely technical
[18:02] steps that it would require to get
[18:04] around the rules that were going to be
[18:08] put in place yeah and and I mean there's
[18:12] this argument of like oh like in China
[18:13] there's also still Bitcoin but it's
[18:15] different like yes you can you can you
[18:18] can buy Bitcoin uh or some OTC desk or
[18:22] whatever uh I never did that but I heard
[18:25] it from from other people that it's
[18:26] possible and that the volume's actually
[18:28] not not that bad for for the regulations
[18:32] that are there uh but I much prefer that
[18:36] Bitcoin isn't illegal and that Bitcoin
[18:38] is actually normalized in society and
[18:40] that I can actually talk about it and
[18:43] people don't look at me like a truck
[18:45] dealer so so like that we we we don't
[18:49] want uh an a hostile environment even
[18:52] though uh yes Bitcoin might not care
[18:56] because in other countries it will be
[18:57] better better but you might care and
[19:00] your family might care and uh all your
[19:03] all your people in your country might
[19:05] care because they actually might um
[19:08] benefit a lot from a friendly Bitcoin
[19:10] regulation and not a hostile Bitcoin
[19:11] regulation so I I think uh bitcoiners
[19:15] should not be um afraid or should not be
[19:20] um too arrogant to be in not in politics
[19:25] like maybe it was not clear but like
[19:27] it's it's like people sometimes in
[19:30] Bitcoin is like ah I don't care about
[19:31] politics someone else should do it or
[19:33] like uh politics doesn't matter like
[19:36] that's a kind of an an an almost an
[19:38] arrogant way of saying like uh someone
[19:40] else should do it and and I'm above the
[19:42] law I'm above politics I'm above that
[19:44] like you're not that above it yes you
[19:48] can flee the country yes Bitcoin is of
[19:50] custody if you have it in your brain
[19:52] they they cannot take it from you but do
[19:55] you really want to live like that is
[19:57] that really the life you want to have
[19:59] yeah you know it's it's fascinating this
[20:01] is so fascinating to me because maybe
[20:03] when I was younger and more naive like I
[20:06] very much fell into the Trap of I don't
[20:09] want to be involved in politics you know
[20:11] I've got my don't tread on me sign here
[20:14] I was involved in the Tea Party Movement
[20:16] in DC and really wanted nothing to do
[20:19] with politics my my involvement with
[20:21] with the tea party was like shut down
[20:24] the government like leave us alone get
[20:26] you know get out of here um
[20:29] but as I got older and had all these
[20:30] experiences and lived in other countries
[20:32] and came back and came to work in the
[20:34] Bitcoin industry and of course we all
[20:36] went through covid one thing that became
[20:39] very very obvious is like if we don't
[20:43] participate in making the rules and
[20:46] regulations that are that govern our
[20:49] societies then we're going to be
[20:51] governed by rules and regulations made
[20:54] by people who hate us and I don't want
[20:57] to live in that situation who wants to
[20:59] live in that situation and there is this
[21:02] fine line that you reference like oh we
[21:04] don't have to follow the rules and we
[21:06] can just leave and and whatever but like
[21:10] you leave enough places you know you
[21:12] neglect local rules and regulations in
[21:15] enough places and just keep leaving and
[21:17] then there's nowhere to go where are you
[21:19] going to go you know and sure you can go
[21:21] live off grade and in some place and
[21:24] maybe we'll all do that one day um but
[21:27] we have friends and family am and
[21:29] communities and I don't want to leave
[21:30] them behind to be governed by Communists
[21:33] like you know so I I I have come to
[21:36] think the scop was actually convincing
[21:39] people that it didn't care that it
[21:42] didn't matter if they cared and that it
[21:44] was cool not to care and you know you're
[21:49] you're stupid and lame and haha haha you
[21:53] think voting matters and and haha you
[21:56] want to participate in structuring the
[21:58] rules and regulations that we have to
[22:00] live under like but there is no haha
[22:02] like the haha is oh you want to be
[22:04] governed by the people making the rules
[22:07] that hate you like it just it only
[22:09] requires a little bit of common sense to
[22:12] say like actually we should probably be
[22:15] involved in
[22:17] this es especially if that construct has
[22:23] the Monopoly on violence like you you
[22:26] you want to be a a loud voice in that
[22:31] arguing for freedom and not for
[22:33] communism um because if
[22:35] communism takes over and they have the
[22:37] Monopoly on violence they can do a lot
[22:40] of bad things to to the Freedom
[22:42] Fighters absolutely as we have seen them
[22:45] done throughout history and as they were
[22:49] doing quietly here in the United States
[22:52] you know this is it's it's a good point
[22:57] and it's extremely important you know I
[23:00] mean don't give up your guns and don't
[23:03] stop
[23:04] fighting and I want to bring one point
[23:07] up Al that that you make of of Twitter
[23:09] being some sometimes not reflecting
[23:12] reality uh and I lived through that I
[23:15] was one year completely in Twitter uh uh
[23:19] and uh then I started doing podcasting
[23:22] and a lot of my opinions actually
[23:24] changed or was kind of softened with the
[23:27] podcast because all of the sudden I
[23:28] spoke with so many people that actually
[23:30] work in the industry actually uh
[23:32] integrating with with systems uh and uh
[23:36] Twitter can be a very radical place and
[23:40] I love it for that because it is radical
[23:42] and extreme and it kind of shows like it
[23:44] uh it it it's really you you say small
[23:48] thing and they they they pick like the
[23:50] one small thing that maybe was not 100%
[23:52] correct so it's it's a humbling place
[23:55] also uh but it's not reflecting reality
[24:01] to the degree it should and uh I think I
[24:04] think it's sometimes important also as a
[24:07] bitcoiner step out of that and see a
[24:10] bigger picture of the actual world and
[24:12] not like the hyper uh pure Bitcoin uh
[24:17] Twitter way uh which which is good that
[24:20] we have like it's it's it's not a bad
[24:22] thing but uh we we that that is not
[24:25] reality yeah no absolutely I I agree
[24:28] with both in that I'm glad it exists I
[24:31] think it helps us again with the over 10
[24:33] window it helps us keep the over 10
[24:35] window like towards that crazy Freedom
[24:40] super Purity narrative um and and
[24:43] ultimate destination but also go outside
[24:47] and touch grass go to your local Meetup
[24:51] you know I first started getting
[24:52] involved after going to my first Bitcoin
[24:56] event I found a local group and we
[24:58] actually had three you know one north of
[25:01] me one south of me and one that we
[25:02] started where I live and interact with
[25:06] people in real life and and you will get
[25:09] a very serious reality check uh normies
[25:12] are
[25:13] just very far behind and that's okay but
[25:17] I think it's much more important that we
[25:19] interact with people in real life um
[25:23] versus you know I mean I do a lot of I
[25:25] spend a lot of time screaming on the
[25:27] internet but I think
[25:28] you know the time that I spend in real
[25:31] life whether it's at the local meetups
[25:34] or at work trying to build real products
[25:37] all of that time is is way more valuable
[25:40] yeah it's it's it's a it's a better
[25:41] spent time that's for sure uh it it's uh
[25:46] I I unfortunately did not read really
[25:48] into the the IMF thing because you
[25:50] mentioned it before uh what do you think
[25:52] about IMF andl Salvador currently it's
[25:55] also like the they now stop buying
[25:57] Bitcoin I I heard but uh
[26:01] n po post of the Bitcoin Stacks what's
[26:04] going on there so I'm not sure yet I'm
[26:08] watching it obviously and you know it's
[26:11] a complicated situation like none of us
[26:14] are trying to run a country right and
[26:18] so what would you do right I mean if you
[26:21] are running a country and you have
[26:23] access
[26:24] to a massive massive amount of money and
[26:28] you're trying to take your country from
[26:30] this small dangerous place in Latin
[26:35] America that most people have never
[26:37] heard of and if they've heard of it it's
[26:38] because of the level of violence and you
[26:40] want to turn that country into Singapore
[26:44] which is their goal um it takes a lot of
[26:47] capital to do that and so when they
[26:50] initially announced the IMF loan um of
[26:54] course I don't like the IMF I hate the
[26:56] IMF like I think it's a a terrible
[26:59] terrible
[27:00] terrible thing that exists but going
[27:03] back to reality it does exist
[27:06] and it may need to be leveraged you know
[27:09] one of my trafi friends when El Salvador
[27:12] initially um a few months ago initially
[27:15] announced that they were going to do the
[27:16] loan one of my trifire friends was like
[27:19] well look and he and he's a big
[27:20] bitcoiner he was like look if you have
[27:22] access to that much Capital you have to
[27:26] take it I mean you just you know you
[27:27] need the money to to run your country
[27:29] and build your country so at the time I
[27:31] was like okay that makes sense um and I
[27:34] think what came out yesterday is this
[27:37] new document with new terms and people
[27:40] found in their uh terms that explicitly
[27:45] stated that they were not allowed to
[27:47] continue accumulating Bitcoin um but
[27:50] then we saw bu Kelly tweet basically
[27:54] like oh haha like you think we're going
[27:57] to stop buying Bitcoin
[27:58] and so the one thing that we know for
[28:01] sure is that there's a lot that we don't
[28:04] know you know and it may be that those
[28:07] terms are in there and buelli had a
[28:11] meeting with them and said we're not
[28:13] going to abide by that but we'll take
[28:14] your money and that they gave him the
[28:16] money and that he was going to keep
[28:17] buying Bitcoin like we don't know
[28:20] but we never have all the information
[28:23] right and
[28:25] so I just I think not like withholding
[28:29] an extreme judgment is probably the most
[28:32] intelligent thing to do because we don't
[28:34] know exactly what's going to happen we
[28:36] don't have all the pieces of information
[28:37] and also like none of us are the
[28:40] president of a country you know you can
[28:43] yell online all that you want that you
[28:45] don't like this or you don't like that I
[28:46] mean I do it all the time but when
[28:49] you're actually in that position right
[28:51] like the things that I'm screaming on
[28:52] the internet that I I hope will happen
[28:56] are in massive cont contrast with like
[28:59] when I go into the office and we're
[29:01] building products we have to comply with
[29:03] all of this nonsense that exists and I
[29:06] like to put equal efforts into
[29:08] dismantling the nonsense but so long as
[29:11] it exists as rules regulations laws
[29:15] things like that things like the rules
[29:17] the IMF has in place to some extent we
[29:20] have to abide it but it's certainly
[29:22] interesting what's happening there um I
[29:27] I'm trying to be more white pilled than
[29:29] like have hope and give people the
[29:30] benefit of the doubt and I hope he keeps
[29:33] buying Bitcoin and maybe he buys enough
[29:36] Bitcoin that he can go back and pay off
[29:38] the loan and and really tell them to
[29:40]  off um but we won't know until we
[29:43] watch it play out
[29:46] um it's interesting down there you know
[29:49] it's not I think I tweeted yesterday
[29:50] like I believe that they will achieve
[29:52] their goal and that in 20 or 30 years
[29:55] from now you're going to go visit El
[29:56] Salvador and it's going to be
[29:58] akin to a Singapore or a Dubai which
[30:01] will have been an insanely incredible
[30:05] feat but it is not nor do I think it
[30:08] really ever set out to be like a Utopia
[30:12] for Anarchy and an non Anon
[30:16] anonymity um everything there is
[30:19] kyc um again they're building kyt KYB
[30:24] into a lot of the processes and so you
[30:28] know there's there's pros and cons to
[30:29] all of these structures and all of these
[30:31] deals and there's no Perfection there's
[30:34] just what are you willing to to
[30:36] compromise on let's take a break for a
[30:39] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[30:41] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:44] watches those watches are the most
[30:47] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[30:50] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[30:53] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:56] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:59] watch collections you have the date of
[31:02] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[31:05] there and of course also the block
[31:07] height and which EPO we are currently in
[31:11] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:13] in this masterpiece make sure to check
[31:16] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[31:19] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[31:21] those watches so so much and now if you
[31:25] have Bitcoin I really do hope that you
[31:27] don't have it on Exchange but if you do
[31:29] have it on Exchange I have two ways for
[31:31] you to deal with that the first way is
[31:34] you put it on a hardware wallet that's
[31:36] the entry for you to get into the self-
[31:39] custody game I recommend bitbox Bitcoin
[31:42] only Edition for that it's a super
[31:45] simple and secure way and if you check
[31:48] out the link in the description you even
[31:50] get 5% off if you use the code Robin and
[31:53] the second way is the Bitcoin way the
[31:56] Bitcoin way is your Allin partner in
[31:59] terms of how to get the most out of your
[32:03] sovereignty they will personalize for
[32:05] you a self custody setup that is perfect
[32:08] for your individual situation they will
[32:11] show you how you can secure your own
[32:14] devices securing your Bitcoin is not
[32:16] enough you also have to keep all your
[32:18] devices secure one topic that is
[32:20] overlooked often is the inheritance plan
[32:24] what happens with your Bitcoin once you
[32:26] are no longer here do you have a plan
[32:29] for that in place already and last but
[32:31] not least if you're in a jurisdictions
[32:33] where you don't feel safe it's better to
[32:36] get a plan B for all that head over to
[32:39] the Bitcoin way.com
[32:42] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[32:45] just a quick side note I will be for the
[32:48] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[32:50] Prague event in June it will be
[32:53] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[32:55] looking forward to seeing all of you
[32:57] there there you can get your ticket in
[32:59] the link down in the description of
[33:02] Bitcoin Brock and very important use
[33:04] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket
[33:08] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:10] there yeah it's also
[33:12] interesting what happens if America now
[33:15] starts buying Bitcoin and and does less
[33:18] and less regulations uh on on bitcoin
[33:22] and then they don't let El Salvador do
[33:24] this do the same the IMF that that's an
[33:26] interesting dynamic between America and
[33:29] the IMF even yeah and and you know uh El
[33:33] Salvador has front run everybody
[33:37] so even if that plays out they could
[33:41] still come out ahead you know what I
[33:42] mean there there's so many different
[33:44] factors there um if the US I mean the us
[33:48] could certainly print money to buy
[33:49] Bitcoin but then what happens to the
[33:52] dollar um and in the end who owns the
[33:56] most amount of Bitcoin it's GNA be
[33:58] interesting to see for
[34:00] sure it's just fascinating for me that
[34:03] that Sor has a half a million Bitcoin I
[34:04] mean Sor not but strategy but like that
[34:08] that is just like just starting in 2020
[34:10] and having so many that that's kind of
[34:11] amazing uh it makes it wonder what what
[34:15] what if uh someone like saor would be
[34:18] now the president of
[34:21] America what they can acquire like four
[34:23] million Bitcoin like they if they are
[34:25] really aggressive with it especially
[34:27] with the pying bar of of the Central
[34:29] Bank basically right yeah that would be
[34:32] incredible and you know that kind of
[34:34] speaks to my point of like let's
[34:36] Champion incremental improvements we
[34:38] have someone in the White House who is
[34:40] not hostile to bitcoin and then maybe
[34:43] next we get someone who is pro Bitcoin
[34:46] and then maybe one day we have a sailor
[34:49] as President right would be fun um a lot
[34:51] of people
[34:53] also hyped the last election between
[34:56] Biden and
[34:58] like Harris and Trump then uh as a fork
[35:01] in the road and I think a lot of
[35:03] bitcoiners also see Bitcoin almost like
[35:06] a fork in the road of are we going down
[35:08] a sound money uh nons surveillance kind
[35:12] of a a road or are we going down the
[35:15] cbdc and and digital Euro and that kind
[35:18] of a road um are we are we now with
[35:22] America uh being on the right side of of
[35:25] of the history at least as seems right
[35:28] now um already on on the path to the
[35:31] Bitcoin world or is that fork do you
[35:34] think still in in front of us there are
[35:36] I think there's a few things that need
[35:39] to play out before we finalize which
[35:42] direction we've gone and one of those
[35:44] things involve more privacy tools built
[35:47] on bitcoin so we saw you know the
[35:51] aggressive shutdown of
[35:53] mixers um that were those were
[35:56] significant tools that that bitcoiners
[35:58] and people in crypto could use uh to
[36:01] remain anonymous or you know I want to
[36:04] say that
[36:06] we have made a significant step towards
[36:10] hard money and Bitcoin but the one thing
[36:12] that I want to make sure that doesn't
[36:14] get lost in the conversation is that
[36:16] when we talk about Bitcoin as Freedom
[36:19] money we're really referring to bitcoin
[36:22] that has not been kyc that's not
[36:25] controlled by an institution or
[36:27] traceable by the government the way that
[36:29] a do the dollar is a digital dollar and
[36:32] so we need to either Champion non- kyc
[36:37] Bitcoin or abolish the M AML
[36:41] laws or build more privacy tools so that
[36:45] we can use Bitcoin in the way that it
[36:48] was always intended to be
[36:50] used how is it is in is it in America to
[36:54] get a
[36:55] nonky Bitcoin
[36:58] the European Union definitely wants to
[37:00] make it more difficult right now yes it
[37:03] is very difficult so you you have to go
[37:06] basically to to B do do we have some
[37:09] platforms like I think in in in
[37:10] Switzerland we have Beach Bitcoin where
[37:12] you can buy nonky Bitcoin uh on a
[37:15] platform so so is there things like that
[37:19] in America yeah so I think bisque is
[37:22] probably the most popular here um and
[37:25] you can still buy small amounts at a lot
[37:27] of the ATMs but it is getting harder and
[37:31] harder um
[37:34] and it's going to continue to get harder
[37:37] uh so like there's a real is that maybe
[37:41] even the the most important battle in
[37:43] Bitcoin the the the Privacy battle I
[37:47] think probably because if we end up with
[37:50] all of our
[37:51] Bitcoin in the existing traditional
[37:56] Financial structures
[37:58] then it's not that different than a
[38:00] digital dollar it is in the sense that
[38:04] you can get it out with the Privacy
[38:07] tools and mixers and you know a little
[38:11] bit of technical skill of course um but
[38:14] what I don't want to see is just the
[38:18] recreation of Fiat structures on a
[38:23] blockchain um as we're seeing with some
[38:26] of these other shitcoins like Ripple and
[38:30] ethereum um you know obviously th that
[38:33] is just
[38:35] nonsense um but this is still a factor
[38:38] in Bitcoin development and so I think
[38:42] this brings us back to the importance of
[38:45] fighting the regulation and you know
[38:48] there's a lot of studies that have been
[38:50] done that since the AML kyc
[38:54] anti-terrorist you know money laundering
[38:56] laws were put into place in order to
[39:00] surveil the out of the PE out of
[39:03] everyone globally using the dollar um
[39:06] they're not stopping any terrorism
[39:08] they're not stopping any crime right
[39:09] these things are really just tools of
[39:11] control and surveillance and so to me
[39:14] the best hope is in not only building
[39:17] privacy tools but fighting the
[39:19] regulation um it's it's mainstream
[39:22] conversation now to say we might shut
[39:24] down the IRS we might shut down all of
[39:27] these
[39:28] alphabet agencies and so we need to add
[39:30] into the conversation let's also shut
[39:33] down the bank secrecy act get rid of AML
[39:36] regulation and then we've achieved real
[39:40] Freedom how much has changed actually on
[39:43] on the street sentiment uh around the
[39:46] election I mean uh from just a European
[39:50] standpoint a lot has changed of like uh
[39:54] how how how I look at America from two
[39:57] points of like the the mainstream lens
[40:00] it's always funny to to look into that
[40:02] and and just like my American friends
[40:05] and and Twitter and how I see that it's
[40:07] way way more hopeful it seems like
[40:10] people are like hey like maybe it's
[40:12] actually going in a right direction even
[40:14] though people are
[40:15] sometimes disappointed with the uh
[40:18] coinery and the Trump meme coin and all
[40:21] those things but I think if you focus on
[40:25] like the big things that are happening
[40:27] like Ross is free I think not not a lot
[40:29] of not enough people talk about that
[40:31] like there there was some tweet that I
[40:34] really loved I'm like oh like sometimes
[40:37] I just think about coining and this
[40:38] and that but then I remember Ross is
[40:41] free how amazing is that so uh what I
[40:45] want to get it is how how is it in
[40:48] America the sentiment shift uh in maybe
[40:51] also in your area in your friend cirle
[40:53] your family circles in in in where you
[40:55] live I am full of Hope and everybody I
[40:59] know is full of Hope and excitement
[41:02] again excitement for the future uh for
[41:05] what we could build and what our Our
[41:07] Lives might look like um you know I
[41:10] think there's still a small percentage
[41:12] of people these really ingrained people
[41:16] on on the left that are very far left
[41:18] and and very dug into the propaganda who
[41:21] are terrified so we still see a little
[41:24] bit of a divide but more and more people
[41:28] are waking up to the corruption that
[41:32] Trump and his new cabinet are fighting
[41:34] you know I think they're uncovering all
[41:36] of these different things every day we
[41:38] wake up and there's some new nonsense
[41:41] that has been uncovered but instead of
[41:44] nonsense being uncovered like oh I can't
[41:47] believe they're doing this what we're
[41:49] seeing is look at what they were doing
[41:51] and we have stopped it and so how can
[41:55] you not be excited about that you know
[41:57] what I mean I'm excited I'm very hopeful
[42:00] we're seeing insane budget cuts and
[42:03] insane amounts of corruption being shut
[42:06] down of course there's always you know
[42:09] the bar kind of gets moved from the
[42:12] purists um but there's so much to be
[42:16] excited and hopeful about and it's it's
[42:20] an incredible thing to be alive for and
[42:23] live through what one of the highlights
[42:28] uh of of the administration was actually
[42:30] JD Vans uh being in Munich and
[42:32] delivering an amazing speech I I I I
[42:36] first only heard about the mainstream
[42:38] coverage of like oh like JD Vans is
[42:40] trumping on Europe like the the
[42:43] relationship to to uh to uh America is
[42:46] not good anymore and stuff like that
[42:48] then I was like oh like let's see what
[42:49] he actually said in in the speech and I
[42:51] was like listening to a speech like he
[42:53] just said facts and he just said that we
[42:56] have to protect freedom of speech
[42:58] basically that was his whole speech was
[43:00] like how can you be against that like
[43:02] how can you say anything he he did not
[43:04] say anything bad about anyone I mean he
[43:07] he pointed to some uh bad freedom of
[43:10] speech things that's were going on in
[43:12] the UK which were true and and it is
[43:15] something that uh to worry about H but
[43:19] it's always funny how the mainstream
[43:21] portray something in how the First
[43:23] Source like the actual Source uh is is
[43:26] saying it
[43:27] yeah the propaganda is still going you
[43:30] know every once in a while I'll catch a
[43:32] clip as you mentioned from like the
[43:33] Legacy Media and they're always putting
[43:36] their spin on it uh but what gives me a
[43:39] lot of Hope is the fact that no one's
[43:42] really watching it right um the numbers
[43:45] the viewership numbers are just in the
[43:49] ocean they're so low right they're not
[43:51] even on Earth they're below the Earth uh
[43:53] no one is watching this nonsense we see
[43:55] we see shows being canc
[43:58] um and the numbers are just not there
[44:00] and at the same time you know the people
[44:02] are going to Independent creators and to
[44:06] X and different platforms where you can
[44:09] view the source like the actual speech
[44:11] that was given and so more and more
[44:13] people are understanding that the TV box
[44:18] on the wall is not worth anything and
[44:21] you know we're not going to listen to
[44:22] the propaganda and that gives me hope
[44:25] too like people Ed to laugh at me
[44:27] because I said at least in China they're
[44:29] honest about their propaganda and it's
[44:32] true like in China no one watches the
[44:34] news like you know that it's all lies
[44:37] and I think in the United States we've
[44:39] gotten much much closer to that where
[44:42] the news is still full of lies but most
[44:44] people have come to understand that and
[44:46] so they just don't pay attention to it
[44:48] anymore and that is
[44:51] awesome yeah and the the TV Parx as you
[44:54] mentioned it it just runs now YouTube
[44:57] and Rumble and and no no longer the I
[45:00] don't know Fox News or see see I I don't
[45:04] know a lot of channels yeah even ABC and
[45:08] NBC you know like that many many years
[45:10] ago were seen as like maybe less biased
[45:12] they're all it's it's all very very
[45:15] biased and and they're all working
[45:17] together and cooperating and so much of
[45:19] that has been exposed and there's so
[45:21] many people talking about it and you
[45:24] know I really I think most people have
[45:27] really waken up to that and that gives
[45:29] me hope too right because we are going
[45:33] back to a place where people are
[45:34] thinking for themselves they're looking
[45:36] for the source of information so that
[45:38] they can form their own opinion and
[45:41] that's amazing and even if we disagree
[45:43] on things we can have a debate about it
[45:47] right and and we can go back to a place
[45:48] where we don't agree on everything but
[45:50] we are grounded in reality and we can
[45:54] discuss facts when we might have
[45:57] different opinions on those facts but at
[45:59] least we can agree on what the facts
[46:01] are how much is the social media and the
[46:04] internet empowering actually the
[46:05] individual Beyond Bitcoin like Bitcoin
[46:08] is the money part like but social media
[46:10] and internet and Global Communication is
[46:12] is so important also for that Freedom
[46:15] Movement yeah I think it is you know the
[46:18] the movement of information is just as
[46:21] important as the movement of money and
[46:23] so we have to have the tools in order to
[46:25] do that and again
[46:27] there's a little bit of a parallel I
[46:29] think with Bitcoin where people will say
[46:33] to you like oh well well screw X it's
[46:35] too centralized you know you can go and
[46:38] use now we have noer but before that
[46:40] there were more complicated like
[46:43] messaging systems and you know networks
[46:45] that you could use um and my stance on
[46:48] this is really the same where I want
[46:50] these tools to be as accessible for as
[46:53] many people as possible and no start's
[46:56] getting better and better um I signed up
[46:59] actually with Primal a couple weeks ago
[47:01] and was really impressed with how far
[47:04] they've come in their development and so
[47:07] I think these things are extremely
[47:09] important and play a very very
[47:13] significant role in keeping our freedoms
[47:16] and being able to communicate about the
[47:20] truth about things and then also serving
[47:23] as a a way for people to communicate
[47:26] when they're freedoms are being shut
[47:28] down like if it weren't for X would we
[47:30] know what was happening in the UK or
[47:33] would we have ever seen Vance's actual
[47:36] speech probably not you know or less and
[47:39] less people would have um so it's
[47:42] extremely important and it gives me a
[47:44] lot of hope that I know a lot of people
[47:47] that are getting on X who never would
[47:51] have before you know maybe they had a
[47:53] Facebook maybe not but now they're
[47:54] coming to X to look for news and uh
[47:59] that's awesome and it's like it's it's a
[48:01] circle because uh we have on the one
[48:06] side like LinkedIn and Facebook and now
[48:09] they actually getting impacted by by
[48:12] Twitter and a because they are seeing
[48:14] especially Mark Zuckerberg saw that oh
[48:17] like a lot of people leave to X I mean
[48:19] he sees the data that's why he went on
[48:21] CH Rogan and that's why he he tries to
[48:24] kind of steer away from that censorship
[48:27] thing that he and his company kind of
[48:29] built uh was really fun to see that chro
[48:32] podcast with Mark Zuckerberg where he's
[48:34] like yeah basically up but I'm
[48:37] I'm here now I'm I'm part of I'm this
[48:39] crowd now I I want to be cool
[48:42] again yeah and it's funny you know
[48:45] people were really upset like oh screw
[48:47] Zuckerberg he can't be trusted but I
[48:49] think you're kind of like missing the
[48:51] trees through the forest or whatever it
[48:53] is because we don't have to trust
[48:55] Zuckerberg like the message there is
[48:58] that the popular thing to say and to
[49:02] pretend to be on the team of is the
[49:05] freedom and the non- censoring and
[49:07] things like that so it's not a matter of
[49:09] like do we trust him or not it's a
[49:11] matter of the mainstream narrative has
[49:14] shifted to the extent that he feels like
[49:17] he has to say that and so you know is it
[49:20] trustworthy or not is
[49:22] really irrelevant like it's what needed
[49:26] to be said said and he knew it and
[49:27] that's the
[49:29] win exactly and like Twitter influenced
[49:32] that and maybe Nostra and and and other
[49:36] uh social media platforms or like Rumble
[49:38] even influence Nostra again to be more
[49:42] uh Freedom mind that because they also
[49:45] see like oh we cancel someone and they
[49:48] go to rumble right it's not like they
[49:51] stop using social
[49:52] media they they go somewhere else and
[49:55] they take the audience and their
[49:56] connections and their network uh with
[49:59] them uh so if if you are closed system
[50:02] that sensors a lot naturally at some
[50:06] point you will be irrelevant because
[50:08] people going to the open system where
[50:10] there's more information and better
[50:12] information because more information uh
[50:14] can lead to better information so it's
[50:17] just uh innovat that that we H have a
[50:20] free open social media so I think Nostra
[50:23] is extremely important um uh to impact
[50:27] also the other ones to be more open and
[50:29] to be like hey like yeah you can maybe
[50:34] we all kind of agree on or like 90% of
[50:37] the population agrees on that that you
[50:39] shouldn't say that but we also agree on
[50:42] that it's a good thing that you can say
[50:45] that and not get censored like even if
[50:47] it's a bad idea you should be able to
[50:49] articulate bad ideas uh so even if it's
[50:52] something really bad or something
[50:55] critical so
[50:57] you cannot you cannot sense it anyways
[51:00] like it will land somewhere on the
[51:01] internet right why not on our platform
[51:05] exactly I I completely agree you know
[51:08] censor uh free speech is not for people
[51:10] we agree with it's for people that we
[51:12] disagree with and you know I mean if you
[51:16] go back to like pre- internet days you
[51:19] could never stop anyone from saying
[51:21] anything you know what were you going to
[51:24] do like tape their mouth shut move their
[51:27] vocal cords you know these things are
[51:29] crazy but you kind of play it out to
[51:32] this period of time we had on social
[51:33] media where where people were getting
[51:35] cancelled and all of that and it's like
[51:36] well that's sort of the equivalent but
[51:38] that's not what was ever done you know
[51:40] all that was done was that people
[51:42] laughed at you and they didn't take you
[51:45] seriously and you got sort of socially
[51:48] ostracized and and you got ignored and I
[51:50] think that that's exactly what should
[51:52] happen online as well people can say
[51:55] whatever they want um but we can laugh
[51:58] at them and ignore them and in the end
[52:02] um it's the the good
[52:06] intelligent uh principles and Views that
[52:09] win out and you know I don't know why
[52:13] people are so scared to just merely hear
[52:15] or read things that they disagree with
[52:18] um if you disagree with it you can just
[52:20] move on and ignore it or you can form an
[52:23] intelligent reply and provide a response
[52:27] uh but either way like we're not going
[52:29] to tape someone's mouth
[52:31] shut maybe people are not ready for
[52:34] Freedom they they they don't they they
[52:36] want something that is like a parent
[52:39] above them that that kind of keeps the
[52:41] the kids in place which is a weird a
[52:44] really weird thing but some people don't
[52:48] they prefer having some instant above
[52:51] them that tells them what to think and
[52:53] and in which where to to go even though
[52:56] they would never say that in that words
[52:59] but they kind of do yeah unfortunately
[53:02] this is true you know a lot of people
[53:04] don't necessarily Want to Be Free so
[53:06] that's that's a battle that we have to
[53:08] always fight right and we can't this
[53:10] goes back to like be involved because
[53:14] otherwise the people that want to be
[53:16] governed are going to be the ones that
[53:18] are involved and we don't want to live
[53:20] under the rules that they desire so we
[53:23] have to speak up and build local
[53:27] communities and and be involved
[53:29] otherwise the other side that doesn't
[53:32] care at all about Freedom that actually
[53:34] wants structures in place to govern them
[53:38] they're going to be the ones doing the
[53:40] governing and we can't allow for that
[53:43] absolutely yeah really really cool um
[53:45] one one last thing before we come to the
[53:47] end te how big of an impact do you think
[53:50] Bitcoin will will have overall on the
[53:53] Freedom Movement if you zoom out like 50
[53:55] 100 years of like how how will people
[53:59] look back at Bitcoin of how big of a
[54:03] revolution uh it will be do do you
[54:05] compare it to like the printing press
[54:07] and and some other people do of like
[54:10] that's actually uh evolved our
[54:12] civilization on such a a massive way or
[54:16] is it like one tool out of a toolbox uh
[54:20] kind of a thing no I think it will be
[54:22] massive I think it will be looked at the
[54:24] way that we look at the printing press
[54:26] and the internet I think Bitcoin
[54:29] ultimately will have saved Freedom we
[54:32] are in the battle now and so sometimes
[54:35] you're in the weeds right and you're
[54:37] like well we have to fight this and we
[54:38] need to worry about that but over a long
[54:40] enough time frame I believe that we will
[54:43] look back and Bitcoin will have won and
[54:46] Bitcoin will have been the tool that we
[54:48] used to save ourselves uh the internet
[54:51] changed every single piece of our lives
[54:55] and so will
[54:57] Bitcoin I love that really cool um I
[55:00] have one I think the the question uh was
[55:03] not there before when we made the first
[55:07] podcast I I now ask each and every one
[55:10] of my guests what can we learn from you
[55:12] besides Bitcoin I think uh when we did
[55:14] it we still didn't had it so what can we
[55:17] learn from you besides
[55:19] Bitcoin sure um so there are actually
[55:23] two threads that I have like waiting in
[55:26] my brain that I wanted to post so that I
[55:29] could reference them one is about the
[55:31] Smith Mund act which is it is it was an
[55:37] act put in place in
[55:39] 1948 that disallowed it made it illegal
[55:43] so that the intelligence community in
[55:45] the United States could not run
[55:48] propaganda on its own people and in 2014
[55:51] Obama repealed it he didn't actually
[55:54] repeal it he modernized it
[55:56] and changed the language in a way that
[55:59] allowed the intelligence communities to
[56:01] start running propaganda on its own
[56:03] people and to me this is like a Lynch
[56:06] pin for when this Cascade of things
[56:10] changed uh so I will take every
[56:14] opportunity that I can to speak about
[56:16] that and I'm sort of reply guying on
[56:18] Twitter bigger accounts and people like
[56:21] Mike Benz are now talking about it so
[56:23] I'm super excited about that and if you
[56:25] want to go really outside away from
[56:28] Bitcoin and technology and politics and
[56:30] all of that
[56:32] um I will say I am unfortunately getting
[56:35] more and more questions about Lyme
[56:37] disease and so if you or anyone that you
[56:40] know has lyme disease and is struggling
[56:44] um I have a couple of things that I've
[56:46] written online about this and I'm going
[56:47] to write like a thread that combines all
[56:49] the information so I can just reference
[56:51] it for people um I haven't really
[56:54] discussed it at length but when I was in
[56:56] my early 20s I got very very sick with
[56:59] late stage Lyme disease and was told by
[57:01] many doctors that I would not survive it
[57:03] was in my central nervous system and I
[57:06] did survive and I healed myself entirely
[57:09] and I learned a lot unfortunately in
[57:13] that process
[57:16] and uh I am happy to serve as a source
[57:19] of information for anyone that needs it
[57:22] because as they shut down ior mechon and
[57:28] and I don't I don't know what you can
[57:29] and can't say these days on YouTube you
[57:31] know but during Co we saw the the
[57:34] vilification of Ivor mechon um because
[57:38] it
[57:38] was a relatively like it was a safe easy
[57:43] old drug there was no money to be made
[57:45] on that served as an antiviral and could
[57:47] have helped a lot of people um and and
[57:50] you were vilified and and canceled and
[57:53] shut down for talking about it and there
[57:55] is a drug that exists for Lyme disease
[57:57] it's called dulam Ant abuse and it it
[58:01] does similar things uh has antimicrobial
[58:03] effects and it saved my life uh but a
[58:06] lot of people don't know about it there
[58:08] have only been some very small trials um
[58:12] and so you know that that probably is
[58:14] out of left field for a lot of people
[58:16] but I actually get three or four people
[58:18] who call me or randomly text me a month
[58:21] and say you know I have a friend I have
[58:23] a family member uh can you just talk to
[58:26] to them and I will because I almost died
[58:30] from this thing um and the the
[58:33] mainstream medical industry is of course
[58:37] no help um but there is there is help
[58:40] and there are ways to get healthy and so
[58:43] that's my completely unrelated to
[58:45] anything area of
[58:48] expertise yeah I got yesterday the
[58:50] feedback of like oh like everything is
[58:53] connected to bitcoin but like yeah of
[58:56] course like then then you can connect
[58:58] but I can connect bitco I can connect it
[59:01] to bitcoin because actually Lyme disease
[59:03] is a man-made disease uh made by the US
[59:06] government put into ticks in the 60s and
[59:11] distributed up in Connecticut and in
[59:14] Georgia and Florida and it's a bioweapon
[59:17] fueled by Fiat corruption so there's
[59:20] your Bitcoin
[59:22] connection wh uh what is it like does it
[59:25] uh
[59:26] fight the central nervous system or like
[59:30] how does it work so it's a bacterial
[59:32] infection and if you know that you got
[59:34] bit by a tick and you catch it right
[59:36] away you can take two weeks of
[59:37] antibiotics and it sort of kills it off
[59:40] and that's the end of it which of course
[59:41] is the mainstream narrative that this is
[59:44] this is how you cure it and it's no big
[59:46] deal because they don't want anyone
[59:47] paying additional attention to it and
[59:50] learning too much information uh but if
[59:52] you don't know that you got bit by a
[59:54] tick because they're very small some
[59:56] sometimes we don't see them they can be
[59:57] in the
[59:58] hair and it transmits the bacteria and
[60:01] has time to do its thing it will break
[60:04] down your immune system and it will
[60:07] attack various systems within your body
[60:10] so it can be difficult to diagnose
[60:13] because not everyone has the exact same
[60:15] symptoms because it depends which of
[60:18] your body's systems that it attacks so
[60:21] for example if it you know if it attacks
[60:24] your skin you might get rashes if it
[60:26] attacks your joints you're going to have
[60:27] joint pain there's common things but
[60:29] it's it never looks the same and there's
[60:31] all of these co-infections which is a
[60:33] whole another you know I mean I could
[60:35] tell you about that for hours um but it
[60:37] starts to break down the immune system
[60:40] and then of course you have this
[60:41] bacteria thriving in your body and so it
[60:44] really really attacks you and it can go
[60:47] anywhere unfortunately mine went into
[60:49] the central nervous system and so it got
[60:52] through the bloodb brain barrier and I
[60:54] got to a point where I couldn't speak I
[60:57] could barely function they took away my
[60:59] driver's license um it was really really
[61:01] bad and you do see that but the the
[61:05] mainstream medical narrative on that is
[61:08] that you must have something else
[61:09] they'll diagnose you um with all sorts
[61:12] of you know autoimmune diseases and and
[61:15] all kinds of other things when it's
[61:17] really just untreated Lyme
[61:19] disease that that must be horrible like
[61:22] go going through that and so you were
[61:25] healthy before and and then you got it
[61:29] and and then all of a sudden they they
[61:31] took away your your traval license that
[61:34] that must be that must be hard time it
[61:38] it was uh and I think this is one of the
[61:40] things that radicalized me is not only
[61:44] going through that experience and kind
[61:46] of H having a a a detour from like
[61:49] normal life especially being that young
[61:52] but also I was lucky enough to meet a
[61:56] holistic doctor doctor way back in the
[61:58] day before anybody knew what that meant
[62:01] um he treated the Amish people that
[62:03] lived around us and he was um he was
[62:07] from Norway but he was living in America
[62:09] and I started to learn about the
[62:11] pharmaceutical industry and the food
[62:14] industry and how they were poisoning Us
[62:16] and how you know I mean all of these
[62:18] things that are rabbit holes now that
[62:20] bitcoiners are going down these rabbit
[62:23] holes um I learned about a lot of these
[62:26] things 20 years ago and so when I came
[62:29] to bitcoin and someone confronted me
[62:32] with the fact that everything that you
[62:35] know about money is a lie I just said of
[62:38] course it is you know because I've
[62:40] learned this lesson over and over and
[62:42] over everything you think you know about
[62:44] food it's a lie right the food the food
[62:46] pyramid that the government created it's
[62:48] it's nonsense
[62:50] Pharmaceuticals it's all a lie it's just
[62:52] for profit they don't care about your
[62:54] health um every Everything is a lie and
[62:57] so I think it you know it radicalized me
[63:01] in a way that prepared me for Bitcoin
[63:03] and so when I found Bitcoin it was very
[63:06] easy to say of course of course
[63:09] everything I thought was true was not
[63:11] true now let's find out the
[63:14] truth it makes you like once one of the
[63:18] barriers in your mind breaks uh you
[63:20] question all the other barriers most
[63:22] Bitcoin has come with Bitcoin through
[63:24] that uh but there are also a big amount
[63:28] of of uh of bitcoiners that have broken
[63:32] those narrative down before Bitcoin as
[63:35] you and then Bitcoin came in like oh
[63:38] yeah central banks yeah look into this
[63:40] oh
[63:42] actually things it makes sense yeah it's
[63:44] just like one more uh Stone in in the in
[63:48] the pule it makes a lot of sense really
[63:50] interesting of like uh I I I heard Lyme
[63:54] disease before but never had any contact
[63:56] with that so it's interesting you
[63:59] completely got treated from that was it
[64:02] um just that medication that you
[64:04] mentioned or was it also like uh
[64:06] transforming like diet and and and
[64:09] making Sports and and all that did you
[64:11] also came through that out there oh
[64:13] everything I have tried nearly
[64:15] everything I did a lot of things before
[64:18] I found uh well I was actually sick
[64:21] before they were looking at that drug um
[64:25] so you know I I I didn't I stopped
[64:29] eating gluten for a very long time and
[64:31] this was before glutenfree products
[64:33] existed it wasn't a popular thing to do
[64:35] right you just didn't eat anything that
[64:37] had gluten in it I changed my diet um
[64:40] you know I had always been very active I
[64:42] I played tennis and
[64:46] um but yes I mean there's not any part
[64:49] of my life that didn't get transformed
[64:51] um I used the infrared sauna to detox
[64:54] and I did all kind of different
[64:56] supplement protocols and learned about
[64:59] detox and making sure that you don't
[65:01] have mold exposure and really like
[65:03] optimizing your health so that your body
[65:05] can heal itself um so yeah it it's been
[65:10] at this point almost a lifelong journey
[65:13] to understand all of that and to stay
[65:15] healthy and um you know fight the
[65:20] medical industrial complex and the food
[65:23] industrial complex and I'm so excited to
[65:25] see all of this stuff become popular uh
[65:29] cuz I'm used to getting like made fun of
[65:31] for it in in 2008 there was this
[65:33] documentary called food Inc and they
[65:36] talked a lot about processed foods and
[65:39] um the industrialization of the the meat
[65:42] industry and I stopped eating sick
[65:45] chicken uh my family dubbed this term
[65:48] sick chicken to make fun of me because I
[65:51] I would only eat pasture raised meat and
[65:54] you know at at the time this was like a
[65:57] weird conspiracy theory Niche thing that
[66:00] nobody cared about uh but now it's very
[66:02] popular and I talk to people about it
[66:04] all day and I love it it makes me so
[66:07] happy that so many people are informed
[66:10] about these things now yeah people are
[66:12] getting more informed it's it's it's
[66:14] like you you cannot trick people as easy
[66:17] as as like imagine without the internet
[66:21] uh you control the the the media centers
[66:25] or maybe there like just like free TV
[66:27] channels and you control all of them
[66:29] like then it's pretty easy to to sell
[66:32] something or make something go away but
[66:35] now like everyone has their phones all
[66:37] the time this if if someone captured it
[66:39] and it will land on the internet like
[66:41] and it never goes away the more you try
[66:44] to hide it the bigger the the story gets
[66:47] right yeah it's great you know and this
[66:50] goes back to we talked about like the
[66:52] importance of access to information and
[66:55] so important and it's getting easier and
[66:58] easier and that gives me so much hope
[66:59] for the future absolutely really cool um
[67:03] we have an entertain in the podcast
[67:05] where the previous guest is actually
[67:06] question is actually asking a question
[67:08] for the next guest without knowing who
[67:10] the next guest actually is um and the
[67:12] question for you is what is the worst
[67:14] thing you can you could do in Bitcoin
[67:19] diversify right into into all the other
[67:22] coins because I'm late to bitcoin or or
[67:24] some nonsense sense like no no no no no
[67:28] study more study more look up pets.com
[67:31] right like the try to really understand
[67:36] Bitcoin do do do not sell there's no
[67:38] second best yeah yeah and also like I
[67:42] think the missing piece for a lot of
[67:44] people is the understanding of Fiat and
[67:47] so they're in Bitcoin to make more Fiat
[67:50] and they think that these other coins
[67:52] are going to make them more Fiat and
[67:55] that's kind of the goal and the mindset
[67:57] like I admit when I first found Bitcoin
[67:59] you know I'm looking at it from the
[68:01] technology perspective and I didn't
[68:04] understand all this stuff about like
[68:05] Fiat and central banks and and the
[68:08] structure and and money Printing and all
[68:10] of that and I think that's the missing
[68:12] piece for most people so they don't
[68:15] quite under you have to really
[68:17] understand the problem Bitcoin solves
[68:19] before you can have the
[68:21] conviction for Bitcoin the way that we
[68:23] do and so the mistake you know is to try
[68:27] to diversify and and the only reason
[68:30] people do that is because they don't
[68:31] truly understand Bitcoin or
[68:34] Fiat absolutely 100% agreed thank you so
[68:37] much uh Michelle for being on already a
[68:40] second time on my podcast was was a real
[68:42] pleasure um before uh I let you go uh
[68:46] what is the best way to reach out to you
[68:48] uh contact you and and and Ria stuff
[68:51] sure so I'm almost exclusively on X and
[68:54] it's just my name Michelle Weekley uh my
[68:57] DMs are open you can message me there I
[69:00] am working towards migrating to noer you
[69:03] know there's only so much time in the
[69:04] day uh but I am there and and I presume
[69:07] I'll spend more time there in the future
[69:09] but right now I'm primarily on X because
[69:11] I'm trying to reach normies and um yeah
[69:15] you can message me there if you're
[69:17] you're trying to contact me but I will
[69:19] not message you there's a lot of bots
[69:22] still the Bots problem uh I think it it
[69:25] will not go away anytime soon still get
[69:28] like like I think it seems like every
[69:30] second or third week someone comes to me
[69:33] and like hey I reported free scammers
[69:36] I'm like ah okay it's so normal now that
[69:39] there are scammers and Bots and
[69:40] impersonators out there it's a bad thing
[69:43] but it's it's it's unfortunately already
[69:46] very uh normal but I think it's great
[69:50] that you also like I I I see it as a bad
[69:54] thing if we completely switch away to
[69:58] from Twitter to Nostra um I think we
[70:01] need those digital soldiers uh to be
[70:06] also on Twitter on YouTube on Tik Tok on
[70:09] Instagram on LinkedIn to have the
[70:11] freedom mindset and the Bitcoin mindset
[70:14] and represent that that thing also there
[70:17] it's the same with fleeing the country
[70:20] right if all Bitcoins are going going
[70:22] now to Nostra Twitter is not going away
[70:25] Twitter is way bigger than than Bitcoin
[70:27] it's just Bitcoin will no longer be
[70:29] represented on Twitter yeah and I really
[70:32] miss a lot of my friends you know a lot
[70:34] of the the people that I loved following
[70:38] and
[70:38] interacting uh are exclusively on Noster
[70:41] now and I get it I understand it but I
[70:44] miss I miss a lot of them and I do think
[70:47] it's a disservice for some of that
[70:49] content not to be available to a wider
[70:52] audience um so that's you know the only
[70:55] reason I haven't made the complete jump
[70:57] yet I think over time there will be a
[70:59] migration but I agree with you it's very
[71:01] important to represent those
[71:03] conversations and narrative to the
[71:05] normies who are still on these other
[71:08] platforms and you can you can copy uh
[71:11] like it doesn't mean you have to one
[71:14] post here like this podcast is on
[71:17] YouTube Rumble Spotify Apple podcast
[71:20] Twitter uh and like five other podcast
[71:23] platforms doesn't
[71:25] you can have different platforms like I
[71:28] think also like for Twitter for podcast
[71:30] it's more normal but also for posts like
[71:33] why wouldn't you copy the Twitter posts
[71:35] to Nostra that makes total sense sure
[71:38] but yeah just me nning out about social
[71:41] media uh thank you so much Michelle for
[71:44] for being on and taking the time also
[71:45] thank you so much for everyone that is
[71:47] watching and listening for joining us
