[00:00] I think Bitcoin is the apex monetary
[00:02] instrument. It's the apex asset. It's
[00:04] the best place to have your money. You
[00:05] have this huge incentive to hold on to
[00:07] the Bitcoin because of the price
[00:08] appreciation or it's um convertability
[00:11] into other goods and services,
[00:12] especially at this time where we're kind
[00:14] of going through this monumental
[00:16] paradigm shift. You know, you have to
[00:18] take massive action in life if you want
[00:19] to do anything of any significance. And
[00:21] that requires capital. And so for me
[00:23] specifically, I'm going through a career
[00:25] change. I've been growing cannabis for
[00:27] 16 17 years. re-calibrates you as an
[00:30] individual. If Bitcoin didn't exist and
[00:32] I had, you know, a diversified portfolio
[00:34] of bunch of assets that, you know, let's
[00:36] say they appreciate 10 15% a year on
[00:39] average, you're more willing to access
[00:41] that capital to try to chase a higher
[00:44] yield. But it seems in some sense like
[00:45] we could reattach to a Bitcoin standard.
[00:48] Bitcoin is money and it needs to be used
[00:50] as money. And like I'm not using my life
[00:52] to get more Bitcoin. I'm using Bitcoin
[00:54] to get more out of my life.
[00:58] [Music]
[01:00] What have you learned about Bitcoin
[01:02] since you've last been on? I think it's
[01:04] it's about a year. Um, that's a really
[01:07] good question. I would say personally
[01:09] for me and my journey, one of the things
[01:13] I've been grappling with a little bit is
[01:15] um career change and big changes in
[01:18] life. Like I I want to embark on a new
[01:20] path.
[01:22] um you know and so I'm trying to decide
[01:24] whether or not I want to deploy capital
[01:26] to move do I wait you know and you have
[01:29] this huge incentive to hold on to the
[01:31] Bitcoin because of the price
[01:33] appreciation or it's um convertability
[01:36] into other goods and services especially
[01:38] at this time where we're kind of going
[01:39] through this monumental paradigm shift
[01:43] um so what I've had to really think
[01:45] deeply about is like how important is it
[01:48] for me to wait to increase my spending
[01:51] power before I deploy any capital to
[01:53] make changes in my life. And what I've
[01:55] really kind of come to believe is, and
[02:00] you
[02:01] know, a lot of people spend their money
[02:05] like it's limited and their time like
[02:08] it's limitless. And I heard somebody say
[02:10] that and it's very profound for me. And
[02:12] so what I'm kind of like grappling with
[02:14] is, you know, do I deploy capital or do
[02:16] I wait? And the thing that I'm like
[02:18] really getting confronted with is my
[02:20] time is really limitless. That is
[02:22] totally real. Um we can't dispute that.
[02:26] We can't change that. You know, I want
[02:27] to live as long as I can. And my ability
[02:29] to procure resources is much more
[02:31] limited or unlimited. Um so I am making
[02:35] some big decisions about moving and
[02:37] changing careers and whatever. And so
[02:39] that's kind of been the big thing for me
[02:40] is is like, you know, you could sit
[02:42] there and you could hold on to your
[02:44] Bitcoin and it's a profitable endeavor
[02:46] in a lot of ways, like do nothing and
[02:48] hold on to the Bitcoin, but then you're
[02:50] doing nothing. And so that's kind of
[02:51] what I've been having to work out. Like
[02:53] how long do I want to sit here and wait?
[02:55] Well, you know, my my life is finite.
[02:58] And so, um, yeah, I think that, you
[03:00] know, Bitcoin is money and it needs to
[03:02] be used as money. And like I'm not using
[03:04] my life to get more Bitcoin. I'm using
[03:06] Bitcoin to get more out of my life. And
[03:08] so I would say that's the big takeaway
[03:10] over the last year for me is like, yeah,
[03:13] you know, going to have to use some
[03:15] capital so I can move and make some
[03:16] changes in my life. And, you know,
[03:18] that's kind of hard when you're you're
[03:19] all in on Bitcoin. Um, so yeah, that's
[03:23] that's what I've that's the new, you
[03:25] know, I don't know, um, epiphany I've
[03:29] had, I would say. I love that. It's it's
[03:32] it's that using Bitcoin as normal money
[03:36] and not just as a store of value. Like
[03:39] people use it as a savings account.
[03:41] Treat it as you stack it and you never
[03:43] sell it at all no matter what comes your
[03:45] way. Uh and uh then you never use it and
[03:49] what do you is is the goal to dive with
[03:52] the biggest stack ever? Is that does
[03:54] that make sense? I don't think so.
[03:57] Totally. Yeah, man.
[03:59] What what does um what what what isn't
[04:02] what is interesting is the hurdle rate
[04:04] of of Bitcoin because if you switch from
[04:08] I have fiat as my default versus I have
[04:10] Bitcoin as my default, you definitely
[04:13] think a lot more about should I move
[04:16] now? Should should I do should I deploy
[04:19] big portions of my Bitcoin? Should I
[04:21] deploy a big portion of my capital uh
[04:24] into a project into a company in in
[04:26] whatever? How have you experienced with
[04:28] like having a a different uh default
[04:32] capital versus having previously I think
[04:35] you had businesses before Bitcoin. So
[04:37] you experienced the business on a fiat
[04:39] standard and you experienced our
[04:41] business on on a Bitcoin standard. How
[04:42] do you think about investments and the
[04:44] hurdle rate differently now? Well, I
[04:47] think it's exactly like you said, you
[04:48] know, um whatever
[04:51] the compound growth rate for Bitcoin is
[04:54] that hurdle rate. So, if I, you know,
[04:56] I'm going to deploy capital or invest in
[04:58] some sort of a business endeavor, it has
[05:00] to, you know, um, look like it's going
[05:04] to yield me more than it than the
[05:07] capital would just sitting in the
[05:08] Bitcoin. But that kind of goes back to
[05:10] like, you know, you have to take ma
[05:12] massive action in life if you want to do
[05:14] anything of any significance. Um, and
[05:17] that requires capital. And so, for me
[05:18] specifically, I'm going through a career
[05:20] change. I've been growing cannabis for
[05:22] 16, 17 years. And so I want to do
[05:26] something different with my life and
[05:27] that requires me to access some of my
[05:29] savings. Um yeah, but any sort of like
[05:33] investments and whatever like I think
[05:35] Bitcoin is the apex monetary instrument.
[05:38] It's the apex asset. It's the best place
[05:40] to have your money, you know, but then
[05:42] at the same time you need to really get
[05:44] right with yourself. And it's kind of
[05:45] like um been a catalyst for like a deep
[05:48] spiritual journey and like I don't know
[05:50] a lot of inner work like what am I
[05:52] trying to do with my life and how
[05:54] important is everything to me and in
[05:57] that sense I think Bitcoin is very
[05:59] special in a lot of ways and it like
[06:02] re-calibrates you as an individual
[06:04] because if I would did if Bitcoin didn't
[06:06] exist and I had you know a diversified
[06:08] portfolio of a bunch of assets that you
[06:11] know let's say they appreciate 10 15% a
[06:13] year on average you're more willing to
[06:16] access that capital to try to chase a
[06:18] higher yield. You know, if your hurdle
[06:20] rate is 10 or 15%, you know, there's a
[06:22] lot of business endeavors that obviously
[06:24] can require work, effort, energy,
[06:26] whatever, that could yield more than
[06:28] that. Um, but with Bitcoin, you know,
[06:31] what's the what's the kagger on Bitcoin
[06:33] these days? Like 45, 50%. So to deploy
[06:37] that capital into any endeavor that's
[06:39] not going to yield more than that is
[06:40] obviously not fiscally responsible. it's
[06:43] not a good move. Um, but you know, I I
[06:47] will sell Bitcoin to buy things that
[06:49] enhance the quality of my life or, you
[06:53] know, maintain the trajectory of where
[06:55] I'm trying to go in my life. Um, but I'm
[06:58] not selling my Bitcoin to invest in the
[07:00] S&P or Apple stock or some, you know, I
[07:04] don't know, a new AI
[07:06] company. So, yeah, I mean, that hurdle
[07:09] rate is a is a real thing for sure.
[07:12] Interesting. Uh, and I don't know if you
[07:16] already thought about that or like how
[07:19] far you are down the the development of
[07:21] that, but do you already know kind of
[07:23] where your career leads you or is like a
[07:26] direction of where you want to go after
[07:27] kind of this? Uh, yeah. I mean, I have a
[07:30] few things in in the works. It actually
[07:33] looks currently um like my wife and
[07:36] daughter and I are going to be moving to
[07:39] Miami, Florida. Um, I have a few things
[07:42] that, you know, I'm working out some
[07:44] details on that I'm very excited about
[07:47] and when they come to fruition, um, you
[07:50] know, people who follow me or know me or
[07:51] whatever, everyone everyone will know
[07:53] what I'm doing and I think it'll be a
[07:55] good thing. I will say that, you know,
[07:58] just like you and so many other people
[08:00] here in Bitcoin, um, you know, once you
[08:03] understand the magnitude of what this
[08:05] discovery, this protocol, this
[08:07] technology, whatever you want to call
[08:08] it, what this thing can do for our
[08:11] civilization, you become just so
[08:13] passionate about it. And it's just like
[08:15] everybody gets enthralled and you just
[08:17] want to support the movement, help
[08:19] orange peel the world, help drive this
[08:20] thing forward. And so that's definitely
[08:22] where I'm at. I want to do something
[08:24] Bitcoin specific. I want my time and
[08:26] energy to go into helping to push this
[08:28] thing into the hands of everybody the
[08:32] you know I want the financial
[08:33] institutions I mean this might be uh I
[08:36] don't know some people don't like this
[08:37] but I think governments to hold it I
[08:39] think everybody needs Bitcoin and so I
[08:41] want to help in whatever way I can to
[08:43] like shed light on the fact that Bitcoin
[08:45] ushers in the world that I think
[08:48] literally everybody wants to see. I
[08:49] think most people on this planet want to
[08:52] see more abundance, more peace, more
[08:55] consensual exchange, fair trade, all
[08:58] those things. And so, Bitcoin is such a
[09:00] catalyst for that. And then, yeah, and
[09:03] you know, I want to put my energy into
[09:05] to, you know, helping to bring this
[09:07] thing in. Man, I love that. Really cool.
[09:11] Great. Great. Uh, you're a great
[09:13] addition to the Bitcoin team, I would
[09:15] say. Very generating. I really
[09:18] appreciate hearing that, you know. Yeah.
[09:20] I just I think one of the things that I
[09:22] do um people tell me that they you know
[09:25] that they like my positive energy, the
[09:28] enthusiasm, the optimism. And you know,
[09:31] I've been in bitcoins for what is it
[09:33] like I don't know, seven years now. And
[09:35] the more and more and more I think about
[09:37] Bitcoin and the implications of what
[09:39] Bitcoin is, what it's going to do for
[09:41] us, just the more excited I get. And
[09:43] it's also helped me to transmute a lot
[09:44] of the distaste and you know um lack of
[09:49] satisfaction you could say about the
[09:51] world. You know I used to kind of be
[09:53] angry. I think all of us can kind of
[09:54] resonate with that. There's a lot of
[09:56] corruption, deceit, you know, to be
[09:59] quite
[10:00] frankical things happening in this
[10:02] world. And um I'm kind of softening that
[10:06] distaste and that that hate that I have
[10:08] for all that stuff. And I'm kind of
[10:09] trans. Bitcoin's been a a catalyst for
[10:12] me to
[10:12] transmute that hate, you know, into
[10:15] love. And I think if you boil everything
[10:17] down to like, you know, you could go
[10:18] through life and if you distill it down
[10:20] to the most basics, you're either
[10:21] operating on fear or love, you know. And
[10:24] I I I listened several times over the
[10:26] last many years to a speech that Jim
[10:30] Carrey gave in I believe it's 2014 at
[10:33] Harvard to the graduating class. And
[10:36] it's very profound. That's one of my
[10:38] favorite uh speeches and that's kind of
[10:41] one of the themes within the speeches is
[10:43] you're making decisions in life based
[10:45] upon either love or fear. And one of the
[10:48] things that he said that I love so much
[10:49] is is you know a lot of people make
[10:50] decisions out of fear disguised as
[10:54] practicality. And you
[10:57] know when you're going through life and
[10:59] you're making decisions based upon love
[11:02] you know I kind of look at that like
[11:03] you're following your passion. you're
[11:04] you're putting your energy into creating
[11:06] the things that you want to see happen
[11:09] in the world and that can be very hard
[11:11] and in a lot of ways you have to
[11:12] confront that fear and so for me it's
[11:15] like you know I don't know it's like
[11:17] does chicken or the egg come first like
[11:19] something changed internally in me
[11:21] around the same time that I discovered
[11:23] Bitcoin so is it like did I create this
[11:25] this this experience for myself and then
[11:29] find Bitcoin or did I find Bitcoin and
[11:31] then Bitcoin changed something within
[11:33] you know inside of me. But, you know,
[11:36] that's a little esoteric. Um, but I do
[11:40] constantly go back to like this this um
[11:43] I don't know this like real shift that
[11:45] I'm experiencing. And in some sense, my
[11:47] life is like really become very magical
[11:49] and something I'm very happy about. And
[11:52] if I look at that and kind of dissect
[11:54] it, I keep coming down to like, wow,
[11:57] Bitcoin seems to be the catalyst for
[11:59] this. And yeah, it just incentivizes you
[12:02] to like it empowers you to go through
[12:05] life more fearlessly and attack the the
[12:09] problems that you see in the world and
[12:11] do so in a loving and optimistic manner.
[12:14] You know, like I like how um Michael
[12:16] Sailor says, you know, you need to to be
[12:19] constructive. I think it's constructive,
[12:21] cheerful and constructive. You know,
[12:23] like it's definitely, you know, people
[12:25] like to feel that optimism. They like to
[12:28] listen to people that are optimistic and
[12:30] happy. And I think especially in the
[12:31] time that we live in, you know, there's
[12:33] so much fear porn, there's so much doom
[12:35] and gloom. You know, I get on Twitter,
[12:37] everybody's posting, everybody's
[12:38] talking It's like, ah, all these
[12:40] things are so bad. And I agree with all
[12:43] of that, but I don't
[12:45] know if highlighting all the atrocities
[12:48] and all the negative things in the in
[12:50] the world is the best approach to
[12:52] transmuting that. I think that if you
[12:54] shed light on all the positive things,
[12:56] all the changes that are taking place,
[12:58] you know, the potential for a beautiful
[13:00] and abundant world, I think that that
[13:02] has more effect than just shedding light
[13:05] on all the bad things. You know, like
[13:07] Jeff Booth says, you know, if you go
[13:09] around yelling at clown world all day
[13:11] long, you're just strengthening it. You
[13:12] know, energy flows where attention goes.
[13:15] So, I really I really try to pay
[13:19] attention and think about all the
[13:21] positive things and um you know, Bitcoin
[13:24] is sure makes that easy to do.
[13:28] I I I love that. It's like shifting not
[13:31] not hating on fiat but uh loving on on
[13:34] on Bitcoin. I think that that's kind of
[13:36] where where the conversation and the
[13:38] attention should go. By the way, I think
[13:41] I know the speech that you're talking
[13:43] about from Jim Carrey because I love
[13:44] that also. Was it the same one? It's my
[13:47] it's my favorite my favorite quote from
[13:49] him. Uh it's probably the same one where
[13:52] he also says you can fail at you can
[13:55] fail at what you don't want, so you
[13:57] might as well take a chance on doing
[13:59] what you love. And this this this quote
[14:03] just stuck with me when I uh first heard
[14:05] it and it's like comes up like once a
[14:07] week somewhere on my dreams on my either
[14:10] night or daydreams and it just is in my
[14:13] head ever since that speech. There
[14:15] there's there's no single other speech
[14:17] that is so much in my head like like
[14:19] that one. I'm so I'm it's crazy that you
[14:21] also talk about that. Yeah, I listened
[14:24] to it again for like I don't know the
[14:26] 40th time or something the other day
[14:28] when I was sitting in the sauna and it
[14:30] just like gosh it just gets me so fired
[14:32] up because it's so deep. It's so deep.
[14:35] Um I think Jim Carrey is very
[14:37] spiritually awake and I really resonate
[14:39] with a lot of the things that he
[14:41] says, you know. Another thing too as far
[14:44] as like at least for me I um you know I
[14:48] used to be really upset about you know
[14:51] how unfair the world is and you know how
[14:54] it seemed that so many unethical
[14:57] individuals really had an advantage in
[14:59] the marketplace and I've started to
[15:03] started to see it a little bit
[15:04] differently. I I think about the history
[15:07] of trade history, you know, monetary
[15:10] history. And so we go from what like
[15:13] seashells and, you know, eventually we
[15:15] land on gold. Gold gold's physical. So
[15:17] it has to centralize. And in order for
[15:19] the the global economy to scale, you
[15:21] have to have a derivative system, a
[15:23] certificate system of some sort. You
[15:25] know, a custodian takes gold, they issue
[15:26] your certificate, you can take that
[15:28] certificate, you could trade it within
[15:29] the marketplace. But the problem is is
[15:32] like and I actually refer to this as
[15:33] like the game theoretic fuckedness. You
[15:36] know, if you are a unethical, dishonest
[15:40] market participant and you can get away
[15:43] with your dishonesty, you know, like a
[15:45] gold custodian, you collude with a king
[15:47] or, you know, a political regime, a
[15:49] president, whatever. And you could
[15:51] create some sort of you can insulate
[15:53] yourself from a bank run and it's not
[15:55] easy for, you know, the market
[15:57] participants to audit the supply of
[15:59] gold, you know, to see if you've issued
[16:01] more certificates than you have gold on
[16:03] reserve. So what happens is is that the
[16:05] dishonest gold custodian you know
[16:07] becomes central bank they have the
[16:10] advantage in the marketplace and because
[16:12] gold is physical then you have this
[16:15] incentive to violence. So what does that
[16:17] mean? Well it seems to me that that
[16:19] means that the the people who are the
[16:21] best at being dishonest and projecting
[16:25] violence are the ones in some sense that
[16:27] have control over the world. So like
[16:30] instead of being really bothered by the
[16:31] unethical individuals who have you know
[16:35] centralized the power and become
[16:37] corrupt, I actually think about it like
[16:39] the reality in which we live in. I refer
[16:41] to it as the BB world, the before
[16:43] Bitcoin world. you know, that was the
[16:46] incentive structure. And because of the
[16:48] the lack of a of a monetary technology
[16:51] that allowed individuals to, you know,
[16:53] audit the supply of the underlying asset
[16:56] that's on reserve, then you end up in a
[16:58] situation where you have liars, killers,
[17:01] stealers, whatever, who are in charge.
[17:04] So, I actually now kind of like just
[17:06] look at it like, hey, that was the
[17:07] incentives. Follow the incentives,
[17:09] right? Like incentives drive our world.
[17:12] Well, that's now changed with Bitcoin.
[17:14] You know, in 2009 when Satoshi created
[17:17] this protocol and released it into
[17:18] cyerspace, that's like that's like a um
[17:22] an inflection time or like a a
[17:24] monumental change in the way that our
[17:26] world works. And now you have the
[17:29] ability if you can run a node to audit
[17:31] the supply of the underlying monetary
[17:33] instrument every 10 minutes. And so if
[17:35] you have let's say a lightning provider
[17:38] because in some sense a lightning
[17:39] provider is like a bank. you you put
[17:41] your Bitcoin from the base chain into
[17:43] this custodian or this bank and then you
[17:46] get to transact on their ledger with
[17:49] lower fees at a faster rate. But if that
[17:51] lightning provider is dishonest or let's
[17:54] say an ETF issuer is dishonest at some
[17:57] point sooner than later that dishonesty
[18:00] will get exposed. You know the tide will
[18:02] go out and you'll see who's swimming
[18:03] naked. And so I think that just based
[18:05] upon the incentives uh based upon the
[18:08] ability to so easily audit the supply of
[18:10] the underlying asset, it's going to
[18:12] incentivize people to be honest. The
[18:14] honest market participant is now the one
[18:16] who's going to win. You know, in the BB
[18:18] era, the person who could get away with
[18:20] the dishonesty could win because it was
[18:22] kind of easy to do so. Now it's going to
[18:24] be very very difficult to get away with
[18:26] that dishonesty, that corruption. And
[18:28] so, yeah, I think just based upon that,
[18:31] the the the world is going to change
[18:33] significantly. I think it flips things
[18:36] 180 degrees. And it's um I mean, you
[18:38] know, the more and more I think about
[18:40] it, just the more excited I get. You
[18:42] know, it's like, you know, going back to
[18:44] the ETFs, let's say Black Rockck, you
[18:46] know, does proof of reserves and another
[18:49] ETF provider doesn't. Who's going to
[18:52] sell more more Bitcoin ETFs? is gonna be
[18:56] Black Rockck or whoever does proof of
[18:58] reserves, right? And then so, yeah, I
[19:00] mean, I think that's all pretty clear.
[19:02] It's like, you know, everybody wants to
[19:04] work with somebody who's honest. And I
[19:06] think that's also why people are so
[19:07] bummed inside, you know, like it's
[19:09] because we can all kind of feel it like,
[19:11] hey, you know, most people go through
[19:12] life, they want to do the right thing.
[19:14] They're compassionate, they're loving,
[19:15] they're honest. But we we're coming out
[19:17] of an era where really bad people have a
[19:21] lot of control, a lot of influence. And
[19:23] that is disheartening. And it's
[19:25] discouraging. And so it's like, you
[19:27] know, play this thing out whether it's 5
[19:30] years, 50 years, 5,000 years, whatever
[19:32] it is. Like if as long as this thing,
[19:34] like Booth says, stays decentralized and
[19:37] secure. I mean, it quite literally
[19:39] changes everything. It's imposing a new
[19:41] rule set on our civilization. It's
[19:42] forcing cooperation. You know, if you
[19:45] want Bitcoin, how are you going to get
[19:46] the Bitcoin? you either need to mine it
[19:49] or you need to get somebody who has it
[19:51] to willingly give it up for a good or a
[19:53] service that you're offering. So yeah,
[19:57] it's like uh it just incentivizes
[19:59] consensual exchange, productivity, you
[20:02] know, fiscal responsibility. Like in,
[20:05] you know, in my case, if I didn't have
[20:07] Bitcoin and I had a diversified
[20:09] portfolio of other assets, I'd probably
[20:11] be more willing to do things that maybe
[20:14] the world doesn't need, right? Like you
[20:16] know it's there's like almost some of
[20:17] this element
[20:18] of because of the debasement of the
[20:20] currency and because of the increase in
[20:23] supply or the debasement of every other
[20:25] asset that you can hold whether it's
[20:27] equities, treasuries, real estate,
[20:30] commodities, fine art, collectibles,
[20:32] whatever, we're increasing the supply of
[20:34] all those things. So if you're trying to
[20:36] hold your monetary energy or your
[20:38] surplus life force in any of those
[20:40] things or a variety of all those things,
[20:44] well you are being diluted. So as you're
[20:46] being diluted, you continue you have
[20:48] you're incentivized to continue to
[20:50] extract from the marketplace. You you
[20:52] know you have to figure out like what
[20:53] can I offer? What kind of good or
[20:54] service can I offer to continue to like
[20:57] bring in the life force that I need to
[21:00] the energy that I need that is kind of
[21:02] leaking. It goes back, it kind of goes
[21:03] back to um thermodynamics. You know, if
[21:07] you have, you know, gold is increasing,
[21:09] let's say it's 2% a year, the increase
[21:10] in supply. Well, the halflife of that is
[21:12] 35 years. You take real estate, you have
[21:15] 1% annual average maintenance cost.
[21:17] Let's say you're in a jurisdiction that
[21:19] has 1% real estate tax. So, if you have
[21:21] a paid for piece of real estate, you
[21:22] have a 2% loss on an annual basis.
[21:26] That's a 35 year halflife. So if you put
[21:28] your economic energy, if you look at it
[21:30] like a battery into anything that has a
[21:33] 2% or more energy loss, like you're
[21:35] bleeding out at quite a fast rate. I
[21:37] kind of think about like a it's almost
[21:39] like this Prometheus moment. Visually, I
[21:42] kind of like see it like, you know,
[21:44] we're just all, you know, these these
[21:46] creatures navigating through this
[21:48] reality. We're exerting energy. We live
[21:50] in an energy in, energy out, you know,
[21:54] reality. you have to bring energy in and
[21:56] consume it to exert energy. Well, if you
[22:00] take that surplus that you have and you
[22:02] try to store it anywhere, it's like I
[22:04] visualize someone like holding all of
[22:06] these things and it's just it's just the
[22:08] energy is leaking out and then all of a
[22:10] sudden we discover this this protocol
[22:13] and now you can actually capture that
[22:15] energy and you don't have that leakage
[22:17] anymore. And that is just so profound.
[22:20] It quite literally changes, you know, at
[22:22] least most things. The way I think about
[22:25] it, it's so hard to uh imagine how
[22:29] significant this will be like having uh
[22:33] such a monumental paradigm shift as you
[22:35] call it uh which will come from Bitcoin.
[22:39] It's really hard I think for the human
[22:41] brain to see what is currently the
[22:45] status quo. What was the status quo
[22:47] before Bitcoin before like 16 years ago?
[22:50] what already has changed a little bit
[22:52] and what will happen once we go another
[22:56] 99.5% of of of the adoption scale where
[23:00] I don't know people say we are at 3 five
[23:02] 3 4% adoption I feel like we more like
[23:05] at 0.5% adoption because the people that
[23:07] have it most of them don't take it
[23:09] seriously uh till now most most of the
[23:11] bitcoin holders have like a thousand
[23:13] euros lying around on on
[23:15] Coinbase they are not bitcoiners so uh I
[23:19] feel like we at a very low point of of
[23:22] the actual adoption rate and we're just
[23:25] getting started. So it's really hard for
[23:28] me and for everyone else to imagine what
[23:32] will come from that paradigm shift once
[23:35] we are at 80% or 70%.
[23:40] Like it will take a very long time till
[23:41] we're at 100% because there are still
[23:43] places without electricity and internet.
[23:44] So Bitcoin will have a hard time also
[23:46] reaching there but it it will come. So,
[23:50] that's just I'm I'm always almost 500
[23:53] episodes in a Bitcoin podcast and I'm
[23:55] still uh boggled by what's possible uh
[23:58] from from Bitcoin.
[24:01] Yeah. I um I have a good buddy. We were
[24:04] just chatting the other day and one of
[24:06] the things that he goes around and he
[24:08] likes to ask his his friends is like,
[24:10] "What would you be doing if you didn't
[24:11] have to work for money?" And he said
[24:13] that literally every single time he
[24:16] asked that question, the answer comes
[24:18] back is and they would want to do
[24:21] something different than what they're
[24:22] doing, right? And so like this this
[24:26] reality where that we're coming out of
[24:28] where everything is being diluted. You
[24:30] didn't have an effective way to store
[24:31] your value. Then it's incentivizing
[24:34] people to it's like Sailor said, the
[24:36] road to surfom is working for a currency
[24:38] that's growing working. What does he
[24:40] say? The road to surfom is working
[24:41] exponentially harder for a currency
[24:43] growing expon exponentially weaker.
[24:45] Well, I don't think that applies to just
[24:47] currency. It it applies to any other
[24:50] thing that you can hold that the supply
[24:52] of is increasing. And if there's a lot
[24:55] of demand for that thing, it's like it's
[24:56] what is it the elasticity of supply. So
[25:00] if there's a lot of demand for something
[25:02] and there's not enough of it, then the
[25:04] free market will bid the price up. As
[25:06] the price goes up, then the margin
[25:08] increases. As the margin increases, it's
[25:10] a beacon. It's like an incentive for
[25:12] entrepreneurs and capital to move into
[25:14] that sector of the marketplace and
[25:16] increase the supply to satiate that
[25:19] demand with supply. So then it's
[25:21] bringing the value of that asset or that
[25:23] thing that good or service down. And
[25:27] so yeah, I mean it's just having this
[25:29] this finite monetary instrument that you
[25:32] know and because money is, you know, a
[25:34] call option on any good or service the
[25:36] marketplace can produce. Money has
[25:38] infinite demand, right? Like everybody
[25:40] wants more money because it can get them
[25:42] more of other things, right? Like not
[25:45] everybody wants more iPhones, more
[25:48] laptops, more, you know, cups of coffee,
[25:52] right? There's like limitations to how
[25:54] much of things people want. But
[25:56] everybody wants money because it can get
[25:57] you anything else. So you have infinite
[26:00] demand with true scarcity. Now you got
[26:03] the Apex monetary instrument. And if you
[26:06] can hold that thing, you know, it's
[26:09] convertability into other goods and
[26:10] services is always increasing because
[26:12] we're increasing the supply of other
[26:15] goods and services at a faster rate than
[26:17] we're increasing the supply of the
[26:18] Bitcoin. You know, at the last having,
[26:20] Bitcoin became the hardest asset in the
[26:22] world based upon stock to flow. So,
[26:26] Bitcoin supply currently is still
[26:28] increasing until we get to 21 million
[26:30] coins, but it's just doing so at a
[26:32] slower rate than the supply of
[26:33] everything else is
[26:35] increasing. And then it's also the what
[26:39] we're currently seeing is so crazy
[26:41] because we I feel like we are seeing
[26:42] right now the the starting of everyone
[26:45] wants to get Bitcoin and the true
[26:47] scarity will will come in quickly. uh
[26:50] you mentioned be previously the the ETFs
[26:52] and we're now in the second year and and
[26:54] many say the second year, the third
[26:56] year, the fourth year is actually better
[26:58] years for the ETF because those things
[27:00] take time to actually um take take up uh
[27:03] pace. Then we have something weird uh I
[27:07] did not expect at all that we have it
[27:09] already in 205 which is called strategic
[27:12] Bitcoin reserve. Up until now, uh,
[27:15] America just went ahead and and put a
[27:18] different name tag on on the Bitcoin
[27:19] they already have and did not do
[27:21] anything be beyond that. But I think
[27:24] there's a lot coming. And then there's
[27:26] also like Budan, El Salvador, and a lot
[27:29] of other things. And I think there's a
[27:30] lot of moving pieces behind closed doors
[27:32] that that we just don't see or that we
[27:35] barely see. So what do you think is is
[27:38] kind of more near near-term coming for
[27:41] Bitcoin when you see all the all the
[27:43] things all the moving pieces coming
[27:46] together for Bitcoin? Well, I am quite
[27:49] shocked honestly that we are where we're
[27:52] at today. I think most Bitcoiners are
[27:55] surprised um at the rate of change. You
[27:58] know, the fact that we have the
[27:59] strategic Bitcoin reserve here in the
[28:01] United States is is pretty shocking.
[28:03] Even when Trump announced, you know,
[28:05] creating the Bitcoin stockpile for the
[28:08] United States government at the
[28:09] Nashville conference, I personally I
[28:11] didn't think that that would happen
[28:12] until the end of his term if it
[28:14] happened. So, the fact that he signed
[28:16] that executive order is really big. And
[28:19] in a lot of ways, I feel like the like
[28:21] our timeline is like speeding up, you
[28:24] know, and with technology, innovation,
[28:26] human ingenuity, we're creating more of
[28:29] everything much faster. And so it does
[28:31] seem like we're pulling the future into
[28:32] the present at an ever, you know, ever
[28:35] growing faster rate. And so that's quite
[28:38] surprising for me. I do have some
[28:40] concerns like you said, you know,
[28:42] there's probably a lot of conversations
[28:43] taking place behind closed doors that
[28:45] we're not privy to. You know, if you're
[28:48] a financial institution, you're a
[28:50] government, you're a central bank, you
[28:52] have power, you're trying to make this
[28:54] move, you under you're you're coming to
[28:56] the realization that the game theory is
[28:58] is is real and is playing out and that
[29:01] Bitcoin is this this unstoppable force,
[29:05] then you need you need to either adopt
[29:07] it or you die, at least economically.
[29:11] um you would want to figure out how to
[29:13] develop a position without I don't know
[29:17] causing the price to rip, right? So, I
[29:19] do think that there's a lot of
[29:20] conversations taking place behind closed
[29:22] doors and I do think that there's an
[29:24] incentive and I guess this is the
[29:25] concerning part. I think that there's an
[29:27] incentive to keep the Bitcoin price down
[29:29] so that the powers that be can get, you
[29:32] know, uh a significant position, you
[29:34] know, with whatever's happening
[29:35] currently with um the tariffs, you know,
[29:39] like that's kind of concerning. It makes
[29:41] me like wonder. So, we have tariffs, you
[29:43] know, the stock market's crashing, you
[29:45] know, the part of the the strategic
[29:47] Bitcoin reserve or that bill says that,
[29:50] you know, the government, United States
[29:51] government is going to take the Bitcoin
[29:52] that they have and they're going to hold
[29:54] on to it and they're not going to sell
[29:55] it. And then they can figure out in a
[29:57] budgetneutral way how to get more
[29:59] Bitcoin. Then they have their other
[30:01] digital assets, as we would call them,
[30:03] shitcoins. They're going to hold on to
[30:05] those and they're going to put them into
[30:07] their the reserve. But what they can do
[30:10] with those is they can sell them.
[30:12] They're not going to buy more of them.
[30:14] The only way that they can acquire more
[30:16] other digital assets is through seizure.
[30:18] So when I, you know, read it, I'm like,
[30:20] "Oh, so they can sell shitcoins and they
[30:22] can buy Bitcoin, but they can't sell the
[30:24] Bitcoin. So, like it's kind of it seems
[30:26] pretty clear like what the strategy is
[30:28] there. Like, okay, then they're going to
[30:30] figure out how to get a bunch of
[30:31] Bitcoin. And so, I am kind of concerned
[30:34] that there's going to be a bunch of FUD,
[30:36] you know, some corruption, some
[30:38] collusion, and, you know, it could be a
[30:40] bumpy ride. But, it does seem pretty
[30:43] clear at this point that like the world
[30:45] is moving towards a Bitcoin standard,
[30:48] you know, and today I think like, you
[30:49] know, Sailor says this, I love it. Like
[30:51] all the the risk has been stripped from
[30:53] the asset. Like if you if you're a
[30:55] critical thinker and you you can you
[30:58] know think for yourself and you pay
[31:00] attention to what happens what's
[31:01] happening it seems pretty obvious what's
[31:04] taking place but most people are unaware
[31:06] of it like I'm actually quite shocked
[31:08] over the last you know few weeks
[31:10] especially uh I've been talking with a
[31:12] lot of people and it's like you know the
[31:14] the SB comes up they don't even know
[31:17] like I'm like hey you know do you got to
[31:20] understand the United States government
[31:22] is figuring out how to become the
[31:24] Bitcoin superpower of the world. The,
[31:26] you know, an executive order was just
[31:28] signed into effect. The United States
[31:31] government is like figuring this out.
[31:33] Like, you should pay attention. You have
[31:34] an opportunity to frontr run like the
[31:37] elites. And in a lot of ways, that's a
[31:39] first as far as I know in human history
[31:41] that you know, the pleb class, the
[31:43] peasants, whatever you want to say, your
[31:45] average individual has the ability to
[31:46] frontr run. But I think like you know
[31:49] when Jaime Diamond as an example when he
[31:51] was on CNBC what was it a year or two
[31:53] ago and he's like oh well I don't know
[31:55] maybe Satoshi Satoshi could come back
[31:58] and just double the supply. I'm thinking
[32:01] this guy is lying right now. He
[32:04] is the CEO of JP Morgan Chase. Do you
[32:06] think he doesn't know how to pronounce
[32:08] Satoshi's name? Yeah he does. And
[32:10] apparently he's famous for waking up
[32:11] every morning and reading an hour or
[32:13] two. like he knows Bitcoin because of
[32:16] the way that the network is designed,
[32:18] the supply is not going to double. So, I
[32:20] feel like that was like FUD, straight up
[32:23] FUD, so that they could, you know, kind
[32:24] of push the people away, kind of create
[32:27] this this illusion that there's all this
[32:29] confusion and whatever and prevent
[32:30] people from, you know, basically buying
[32:32] Bitcoin and pumping the price. So, I
[32:36] think we're going to be in for more of
[32:38] that. Um, I think that things are
[32:40] becoming much more clear at the same
[32:42] time that they're becoming much more
[32:43] murky. You know, it's like the best of
[32:45] times, it's also the worst of times. So,
[32:47] I guess it's just kind of, you know,
[32:49] it's like a an awakening. There's a mass
[32:51] awakening, but not everybody's going to
[32:53] be a part of that, you know. And also on
[32:56] that note though, I really did shift
[32:59] over the last like I don't know year,
[33:01] year and a half my concern around other
[33:04] people missing out on this opportunity.
[33:08] You know, like the no coiners you would
[33:09] say Bitcoin is making their life better
[33:12] even if they don't have Bitcoin. The
[33:14] fact that people are buying Bitcoin
[33:16] instead of houses is good for people
[33:18] that want houses, right? So that that
[33:20] demonetization is taking place. Another
[33:23] Jeff Booth quote comes to mind. Where
[33:25] you have abundance in money, you create
[33:26] scarcity in everything else. Where you
[33:29] have scarcity in money, you create
[33:30] abundance in everything else. If the
[33:32] money is the hardest thing in the
[33:33] marketplace, then the incentive is to
[33:35] hoard that. And if the money is really
[33:37] shitty and it's being debased,
[33:39] especially if it's being debased at a
[33:40] hyper rate, like in places like
[33:42] Venezuela, Zimbabwe, whatever, then you
[33:44] get out of the money immediately and
[33:46] into other things, and you want to get
[33:48] into other things that have demand on
[33:50] them, which creates the value. Now
[33:52] you're hoarding things that people need.
[33:55] You know, I think we talked about this
[33:56] in in our last podcast, like the fact
[33:58] that I live in a rental and I don't own
[34:01] a home or own multiple homes where I
[34:03] live means that people who want a house
[34:05] where I am at, there's less competition
[34:07] in the marketplace over those houses.
[34:10] And so I think Bitcoin is making
[34:13] everybody's life better, whether they
[34:15] have Bitcoin or not. Now, there is
[34:17] obviously a huge opportunity here at
[34:19] hand because we're we're going through
[34:21] this paradigm shift and this great
[34:24] demonetization and all this monetary
[34:26] energy is going to flow into Bitcoin.
[34:28] The $900 trillion in assets in the world
[34:31] is eventually going to be valued in
[34:32] Bitcoin. And it's my understanding that
[34:34] like half of that is just store of
[34:36] value, right? And so there's so much
[34:39] upside for this. It's it's absolutely
[34:41] incredible. And so there's obviously
[34:43] huge opportunity, you know, and people
[34:45] will get Bitcoin at the price that they
[34:47] deserve it. They'll come into Bitcoin
[34:48] when they're ready for Bitcoin. But I've
[34:50] like stopped being concerned, if that
[34:53] makes sense. Like I'm like, okay, you
[34:55] know, like I've softened my approach
[34:56] towards orange pilling people. And
[34:58] actually, I find that the most effective
[35:00] way in and in in my personal experience
[35:02] to orange pill people is just to be
[35:04] really happy. You know, people
[35:06] are like, "Dang, dude." Especially here
[35:07] in Humbult County where I live, the
[35:09] cannabis industry is is really
[35:12] struggling. And that's just as you know,
[35:14] that's um part of
[35:16] um part of this increase in supply, you
[35:19] know, where in cannabis you had this
[35:21] large margin because there was more
[35:22] demand than there was supply. But now
[35:24] that supply is satiating the demand,
[35:26] right? So that that large margin was an
[35:28] incentive for other people to come into
[35:29] the industry and produce cannabis. And
[35:31] so as the margin is descending, the
[35:35] business is becoming less profitable,
[35:37] the producers are really struggling, and
[35:38] the morale is really suffering. Like
[35:40] where I live, like economically it's
[35:43] it's it's not good, right? And so over
[35:45] the last year and a half, two years,
[35:47] like I've really been quite excited
[35:49] about life and and a lot of people are
[35:51] just like, "What what are you doing? Why
[35:52] are you so happy?" And it's
[35:54] like, well, Bitcoin, you know, and like
[35:56] then that that actually makes them think
[35:58] more than if I try to explain the the
[36:00] the properties of Bitcoin, the
[36:02] fundamentals, the other assets, blah
[36:04] blah blah. It's like that seems to be
[36:06] the thing that cracks the shell or to
[36:08] like it's like the thing that gets in
[36:09] and is like makes somebody more
[36:11] receptive to to what I have to say. And
[36:15] so, yeah, I know shedding love and light
[36:19] and happiness on the world seems to be
[36:21] um at least in my experience, more
[36:23] effective than anything else I've ever
[36:25] tried to do to help people is just show
[36:27] people that, you know, things are good.
[36:29] I think they're good and I'm happy.
[36:31] Let's take a break for a moment and
[36:33] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[36:36] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[36:38] watches. Those watches are the most
[36:41] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[36:43] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[36:46] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[36:49] completely new and amazing Genesis
[36:51] edition of their watch collections. You
[36:54] have the date of the first ever minded
[36:57] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[37:00] also the block height and which epoch we
[37:03] are currently in. I love the level of
[37:06] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[37:09] Make sure to check out those amazing
[37:11] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[37:14] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[37:17] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[37:20] really do hope that you don't have it on
[37:22] exchange. But if you do have it on
[37:24] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[37:26] deal with that. The first way is you put
[37:28] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[37:30] entry for you to get into the
[37:32] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[37:36] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[37:38] super simple and secure way. And if you
[37:41] check out the link in the description,
[37:43] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[37:46] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[37:49] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[37:52] partner in terms of how to get the most
[37:55] out of your sovereignty. They will
[37:58] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[38:01] that is perfect for your individual
[38:04] situation. They will show you how you
[38:06] can secure your own devices. Securing
[38:09] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[38:11] have to keep all your devices secure.
[38:13] One topic that is overlooked often is
[38:15] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[38:18] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[38:21] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[38:24] place already? And last but not least,
[38:26] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[38:28] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[38:30] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[38:35] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[38:38] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[38:41] will be for the first time ever speaking
[38:43] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[38:46] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[38:49] really looking forward to seeing all of
[38:51] you there. You can get your ticket in
[38:53] the link down in the description of
[38:55] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[38:58] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[39:01] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[39:03] there. I said that uh before even I
[39:06] started the podcast, the best way of
[39:08] orange billing people is to live your
[39:10] best life and tell people that you're
[39:12] into Bitcoin. Like if you just if you
[39:15] just do those two things and you're a
[39:16] happy fulfilled person,
[39:19] a family person, someone that gives to
[39:21] their community, whatever makes you
[39:24] happy and fulfilled. If you do that and
[39:27] you're into Bitcoin and tell people that
[39:29] you're into Bitcoin, they make that
[39:31] logical assumption. Oh, like I know 10
[39:34] Bitcoiners and I know 200 people. Those
[39:36] 10 Bitcoiners are on average extremely
[39:39] happy and fulfilled. Those 200 people
[39:41] that I also know are on average actually
[39:44] quite sad.
[39:46] So pe people are not stupid.
[39:50] So I mean Steve Chops was brilliant in
[39:53] in that marketing. Say exactly what like
[39:56] an an iPhone or iPad or part brings. He
[40:00] told you what you needed to know. It
[40:02] makes your life better. And in that way,
[40:04] I think Bitcoin also will will come
[40:07] where people just see like, oh, I have
[40:09] financial troubles. Bitcoin might help
[40:12] because I've seen it with my uncle. I've
[40:14] seen it with my son. I've seen it with
[40:17] my uh mother-in-law. They they they all
[40:21] adopted Bitcoin and their life just
[40:23] improved. And that's how I think we
[40:26] actually Orangeville
[40:27] masses. Also, it's important to educate.
[40:30] Also, it's important to write books.
[40:31] Also, it's important to do all the other
[40:33] things that we're doing, but living your
[40:36] best life and telling people about
[40:37] Bitcoin, I think that's that's just the
[40:40] the secret formula to mass adoption.
[40:43] Yeah. And, you know, I have a question
[40:44] for you being somebody who's interviewed
[40:46] so many Bitcoiners. Um, what's your
[40:48] biggest concern about the, you know,
[40:51] potential issue or pitfalls moving
[40:53] forward? You know, like you must have
[40:55] some sort of concern in the way that
[40:56] this plays out. There there's a lot of
[40:58] uh uh different concerns. I think the
[41:01] biggest one that's ocean tackling right
[41:03] now I think is is really interesting and
[41:05] really important that we don't get a
[41:07] problem with with mining pools that are
[41:09] centralized with five mining pools that
[41:12] basically can call each other and say
[41:13] hey that's a small list we're having and
[41:17] we don't letting those uh transactions
[41:20] through. It's it it won't um it it won't
[41:24] kill Bitcoin but it is something that's
[41:28] worth noting and I like what Ocean is
[41:29] doing. I like the solo mining and Bitex
[41:31] movement a lot. And as as Paponet says,
[41:35] we need a lot of rabbits, meaning
[41:37] smaller miners, solo miners. We need a
[41:40] lot of horses. I think he calls them
[41:41] horses. I'm not sure. The middle big
[41:44] kind of miners that have some, I don't
[41:46] know, 10 20 machines running in some
[41:48] container maybe. And then we also need
[41:50] the
[41:52] does he call it elephants? I think the
[41:54] big ones uh the the marathons of the
[41:57] world and and the really big miners. So
[41:59] mining is something where I'm like we
[42:03] need more of that. I also
[42:06] um and I actually asked that Jeff Bouven
[42:08] and I'm still not we need more full node
[42:11] operators. I think I think we are not
[42:13] yet at a point where yeah it's fine like
[42:16] you don't have to run it. I think the
[42:19] incentives in the end of the day will
[42:21] shake up to be really good and people
[42:23] will run their own full node. I just
[42:25] hope that we don't com become complacent
[42:28] and focus too much on number go up
[42:30] technology and yeah like I have this
[42:32] Bitcoin wallet the number is going up I
[42:34] can afford life I can chill on the pool
[42:37] and and then there's the the the moment
[42:40] we become complacent and don't do our
[42:43] homework and and fight on on on Twitter
[42:47] like toxic maxis. I think that's the
[42:49] moment where we should get concerned
[42:52] that maybe we've lost the plot a little
[42:56] bit. Uh so so that's I I don't see that
[42:59] at all, but that would be something I I
[43:01] would be concerned about. Yeah. So
[43:04] you're saying that like by having the
[43:06] small mining operations, if let's say
[43:09] hypothetically the the five largest
[43:11] mining conglomerates collude together
[43:13] and they start censoring transactions,
[43:15] then those small miners will will
[43:18] process those transactions. The node
[43:20] operators valid validate the
[43:22] authenticity or the the validity of that
[43:25] transaction, the honesty or whatever and
[43:28] that keeps the network decentralized and
[43:30] secure. Absolutely. We need as many
[43:32] people involved that care about the
[43:35] security. There are many people that
[43:37] care about number technology. Uh but we
[43:41] need uh even more people that care about
[43:44] the freedom grop technology, the
[43:46] security of it, the decentralized aspect
[43:49] of it. We need also a lot of people that
[43:51] care about how we scale it. Uh we we
[43:55] have a really nice base layer. H how how
[43:58] how is lining working out? How is liquid
[44:02] working out? How is all those layer twos
[44:04] and layer threes and all those things
[44:06] together? I think we we we we might be
[44:10] we we could do a better job in in in
[44:12] doing that ecosystem, but it's also
[44:15] really early with medium of exchange and
[44:17] I personally get paid in Bitcoin and I
[44:19] pay in Bitcoin uh for post-production
[44:22] members. So actually a bigger and bigger
[44:25] cash flow of my business is is just
[44:27] purely in Bitcoin and just Bitcoin
[44:29] wallets and never touches fear at all
[44:31] which is really cool. This is if if you
[44:35] get to the point where you get paid for
[44:38] something in Bitcoin and then pay
[44:39] someone else with the same Bitcoin
[44:41] basically you're like that's magic.
[44:45] You really experience that magic
[44:46] internet money aspect of it. So that's
[44:49] that's something uh I love and I just
[44:53] recently paid someone I think was was it
[44:56] 800 bucks €800 and I paid.7 cents for
[45:00] that transaction. So it's always a good
[45:02] time to do transactions and and
[45:04] consolidate you takes also and stuff
[45:05] like that. Uh, and it's actually
[45:07] something actually a question I had for
[45:09] you
[45:10] because I'm I'm I'm concerned about that
[45:14] a little bit and I was wondering with
[45:16] all that ETFs and strategic Bitcoin
[45:19] reserve and a lot of institutional uh
[45:22] investors with Micro Strategy and other
[45:24] really big ones coming in um they are
[45:27] really bullish on Bitcoin and the price
[45:29] is actually going up and when you see at
[45:30] the same time the Google trends for
[45:34] Bitcoin we're like at 7% % of what we
[45:37] were at 2017. Um I talked with Danny
[45:40] from Coin Corner and he said the retail
[45:43] bull market hasn't even started. If he
[45:45] looks at the numbers and they have been
[45:47] around for 11 years or something like
[45:48] that. So they have collected uh from
[45:51] Bitcoin exchange standpoint 11 years of
[45:53] data and he said retail never really
[45:56] went in a bull market. It's it's mostly
[45:58] driven the price by institutional uh
[46:01] buyers. So, I'm a little bit concerned
[46:04] that uh uh we we are losing the cipher
[46:07] bank vision and and and and uh we we we
[46:12] might get distracted a little bit. Um I
[46:15] don't see it uh right now, but I think I
[46:19] think if we Yeah, I I will just stop at
[46:22] that and and ask you like what's your
[46:24] thoughts on that?
[46:25] Well, I think that due to the economic
[46:28] conditions that we're in, I think retail
[46:30] has been kind of exhausted. I think
[46:32] there's low liquidity. I think that the
[46:34] cantalon class, the cantillionaires, the
[46:36] people, the the asset owning class, um,
[46:40] they're the ones who have the ability to
[46:43] spin up the capital, the liquidity to
[46:45] buy Bitcoin right now. Um I do think
[46:48] that like this quantitative tightening
[46:50] and and the issues that we've had you
[46:53] know postco
[46:56] um are they're going to need to change
[46:59] like the big print is coming like the
[47:01] system has to continue to debase and at
[47:03] an exponential rate and so as that
[47:06] liquidity gets injected in the
[47:08] marketplace it's it's going to go to the
[47:10] property owning class but then they're
[47:12] going to spend it into the economy and
[47:14] then as as the velocity of money
[47:16] increases is the liquidity increases. I
[47:18] think it's going to find a lot of it's
[47:20] going to find its way into Bitcoin. I
[47:21] think that rate is going to increase.
[47:23] The amount of money that goes into
[47:24] Bitcoin over time is going to increase,
[47:26] but I do think that your average
[47:28] individual
[47:29] um doesn't have a lot of extra savings
[47:32] right now or the ability to to earn
[47:34] extra savings. One of the things that I
[47:36] do think about that I that I believe to
[47:39] be somewhat profound is as Bitcoin got
[47:43] to where it's at today from the
[47:45] peasants, the cipher punks, the, you
[47:48] know, just the plebs, the normal
[47:49] individuals, like the real big money in
[47:52] the world is just starting to get in.
[47:54] And so I think that the upside is huge
[47:57] and we need that as concerning as it is.
[47:59] We need that, you know, and going back
[48:01] to what we were just talking about with
[48:03] the mining and let's say that you have,
[48:06] you know, the the mining becomes a
[48:07] little bit centralized. This is the game
[48:10] theory that I kind of referred to in the
[48:12] BB world. The the dishonest market
[48:15] participants had an advantage if they
[48:16] could get away with that dishonesty. And
[48:18] it was much easier to do so without
[48:20] Bitcoin than it is with Bitcoin. With
[48:22] Bitcoin, the honest market participant
[48:24] is rewarded. So if the mining pools, you
[48:28] know, these large conglomerates or
[48:29] whatever that centralized mining, you
[48:32] know, concern that we have, if they try
[48:34] to censor transactions, well, they're
[48:37] because the protocol is bounded by
[48:39] energy, they have to pay for a lot of
[48:42] energy, harvest a lot of energy, harness
[48:44] a lot of energy to even have the
[48:47] privilege of mining the block. And if
[48:50] they attempt to deny a transaction, then
[48:52] someone else who's honest will just take
[48:55] that transaction. They'll get the block
[48:57] reward and then the honest market
[49:00] participant wins. And so I do think that
[49:02] that's really profound and that's like
[49:04] kind of at least the concept that
[49:07] mitigates, you know, my concerns. Now,
[49:09] don't get me wrong, I'm not laxidasical
[49:11] or complacent. I do think this is very
[49:13] uh important time, but it just seems
[49:15] that there's like this incentive vortex
[49:19] um this this this dynamic or these
[49:22] forces at play because of this protocol
[49:25] that's going to reward honesty and
[49:27] punish dishonesty. Now, my concerns
[49:29] really are is like how bumpy of a ride
[49:32] is it? You know, because there could be
[49:34] some some real issues that we have, but
[49:36] the thing that I find just I don't know.
[49:39] So,
[49:41] I just so beautiful about it all is
[49:44] we're moving in the right direction and
[49:46] that is like really
[49:49] inspiring. It makes me pumped. I'm
[49:51] pumped. Like our our our it seems like
[49:53] our world took a 180° shift in the right
[49:56] direction. Like we we and it almost
[49:57] seems like Bitcoin happened like this.
[50:00] It's like it's you know Eric Kase says
[50:02] it's messionic. Like it's it's like
[50:04] godsend. Like it came at the absolutely
[50:06] perfect time. Like it couldn't have
[50:08] happened any earlier. it couldn't have
[50:10] happened any later and without it like
[50:12] we would be It seems we would be
[50:15] in real trouble, right? And so yeah, um
[50:19] yeah, I think honesty is going to be
[50:21] rewarded now as a result of Bitcoin and
[50:23] that's like just so big of a deal.
[50:27] Really, really is. And this is a really
[50:30] good one with with the ride getting
[50:32] bumpier. I hear a lot about I hear a lot
[50:36] about people saying the volatility go
[50:38] down, but I think actually the the
[50:39] opposite might be the case. I think the
[50:41] volatility might actually go up as the
[50:43] the ride go gets bumpier and and bigger
[50:46] players and and more people uh come in.
[50:49] I could be wrong. It could be also like
[50:51] smooth sailing and the volatility slowly
[50:53] goes down and we're just getting
[50:55] adopted. Um, I always refer to the the
[50:59] time uh where the the Deutsch mark uh
[51:03] hyperinflated
[51:05] uh and you see the price of gold uh
[51:08] rising up massively in the Deutsch mark
[51:11] and then you see overlaid on the graph
[51:13] the monthly in uh change of it in
[51:19] measured in gold and it was just such a
[51:21] zigzag but the price went really quickly
[51:25] up. If that happens and the old system
[51:29] uh collapses completely and I hope we we
[51:33] have a a smooth out sailing of the fiat
[51:35] system and more and more coming just to
[51:37] the Bitcoin system, but it could also go
[51:39] the other way. We having a a massive
[51:42] crash of the fiat system and we we're
[51:44] moving a little bit faster but a little
[51:46] bit bumpier to to the Bitcoin system.
[51:49] That that that's something to look
[51:52] forward. I think will be a crazy time
[51:54] ahead for Bitcoiners. Yeah. Well, with
[51:57] our Keynesian economic model, this
[51:59] inflationary debt based monetary system,
[52:02] the system has to continue to debase and
[52:04] it has to continue to debase at a faster
[52:06] rate. And
[52:09] so,
[52:10] as as deflation, the deflationary force,
[52:14] like the natural state of the free
[52:15] market is deflation, like I love Jeff
[52:17] Boo's work so much. as we're pushing
[52:20] prices down on everything in real terms
[52:23] that requires more debasement to to prop
[52:25] up prices of everything to prevent the
[52:27] system from going insolvent. And in some
[52:30] sense, what I see is is a few things. I
[52:32] see that Bitcoin is like an escape valve
[52:34] for the inflation. It's a place for that
[52:37] monetary energy to go as the currency is
[52:40] debased. And if Bitcoin's price goes,
[52:43] let's say we woke up tomorrow and it's
[52:45] $10 million a coin, that doesn't I don't
[52:47] think that that hurts anybody, you know,
[52:49] but if they if they double triple the
[52:52] quadruple the the currency supply and
[52:55] then housing goes up 4x as a result of
[52:58] that over a short period of time, like
[53:00] people are going to be homeless. But if
[53:02] the Bitcoin price rips, like that that I
[53:04] don't know if that causes really any
[53:06] problems for anybody. Maybe some
[53:08] financial institutions have some maybe
[53:10] it exposes some pro, you know, I'm not
[53:11] quite sure about that, but I think it's
[53:13] like an escape valve for the for the
[53:15] debasement. Um, another thing that I I
[53:18] think a lot about and I'm not I don't
[53:20] know that I'm right or not, but it seems
[53:22] that like we decoupled from gold. You
[53:26] know, the the amount of monetary units
[53:28] in the system relative to the underlying
[53:29] asset on reserve increased to the point
[53:31] where it completely detached in 1971. We
[53:34] all know that. But it seems in some
[53:35] sense like we could reattach to a
[53:38] Bitcoin standard. You know, I believe
[53:41] that we're going to see, you know, uh
[53:43] FDIC insured financial institutions are
[53:46] going to start lending you fiat against
[53:49] your Bitcoin. And in order to to get
[53:52] that liquidity in fiat terms or to get
[53:54] that those dollars, euros, whatever it
[53:56] is, you're going to have to post Bitcoin
[53:58] as collateral. Well, that means that
[53:59] Bitcoin is going to hit the balance
[54:00] sheet of the financial institutions. And
[54:02] if I look at the debt in the world and
[54:05] the assets that collateralize the debt,
[54:07] the assets that collateralize the debt,
[54:09] the supply of those assets is
[54:11] increasing. They're being debased. It's
[54:14] being diluted. And the faster we do so
[54:18] that's deflationary. That means that we
[54:20] need more inflation in the monetary
[54:22] system, more debasement to keep the
[54:24] system solvent. Now, as Bitcoin becomes
[54:28] part of the asset basket that
[54:31] collateralizes the debt, Bitcoin is the
[54:34] only asset within that that basket
[54:36] that's thermodynamically sound. So that
[54:38] unless the financial institutions that
[54:41] have Bitcoin on the balance sheet that's
[54:42] collateralizing their debt rebalance and
[54:45] sell down the Bitcoin and buy more
[54:47] mortgage back securities or equities or
[54:49] whatever they do, treasury bonds or
[54:51] whatever, unless they rebalance, Bitcoin
[54:53] will over time become a larger and
[54:55] larger and larger percentage of the
[54:57] assets basket that collateralizes the
[55:00] debt. Well, if that happens,
[55:02] theoretically, at least the way I see
[55:04] it, the debasement required to keep the
[55:06] system solvent
[55:08] decreases, not increases. So, I actually
[55:11] think it's there's a potential, and I
[55:13] could be totally wrong about all of
[55:15] this, but at least it's like the more
[55:16] and more I think about it, I can't
[55:17] really see another way, you know, cuz
[55:20] the system needs to debase. So, how does
[55:23] the system debase? Well, they're going
[55:25] to lend money into currency into
[55:28] existence as debt against assets. The
[55:30] Federal Reserve buys Treasury bills. The
[55:32] the the fractional reserve banking
[55:34] system is going to create um currency as
[55:38] debt against real estate or equities.
[55:41] You know, Elon borrowed against his
[55:43] Tesla stock so that he could buy
[55:45] Twitter. You go buy a house, you know,
[55:48] you put 50 grand down on a $500,000
[55:50] house. out of that $450,000 that the
[55:52] bank loans you, most of that, if not all
[55:54] of it. I mean, and I'm not a banker. I'm
[55:56] not sure, but it's my understanding that
[55:57] most of that is newly minted
[56:00] currency. And so, Bitcoin is supreme
[56:03] collateral. Like, you can't destroy your
[56:06] Bitcoin. You can sell it, you know,
[56:08] 24/7, 365 globally. So, it's the perfect
[56:11] vector to debase against. And as that
[56:14] happens, then the Bitcoin's
[56:16] collateralizing the debt. And the
[56:18] Bitcoin supply 10 years from now, we've
[56:20] got what 99% of the supply has been
[56:23] mined. So it's like almost to that point
[56:26] of it being like thermodynamically
[56:28] sound. The debasement almost becomes
[56:29] irrelevant at that point. You know, it's
[56:31] going to take us 100 years to mine that
[56:33] last 1% of the supply. So I I I I see
[56:37] and and it's kind of a complicated
[56:38] thing. It's I find that it's been hard
[56:40] for me to explain or even wrap my mind
[56:42] around. It's hard to visualize, but I
[56:43] kind of see like, you know, we detached
[56:45] from gold and we're completely free
[56:47] floating. And I feel like we're going to
[56:49] reattach to a Bitcoin standard. Now, the
[56:52] difference between when we were on a
[56:53] gold standard to being on a Bitcoin
[56:55] standard and having Bitcoin be the
[56:57] underlying asset that the currency is
[57:00] pegged to is the Bitcoin can actually be
[57:03] the the world's money. It could be the
[57:06] currency. where with gold because it was
[57:07] physical, you needed that derivative,
[57:09] you needed that debt certificate, you
[57:11] needed that and it became digital. So,
[57:14] you needed that, but you don't need that
[57:16] with Bitcoin. So, I feel like we
[57:17] detached, we're free floating, we're
[57:19] going to reattach to a Bitcoin standard.
[57:21] And when I visualize that or think about
[57:23] that, I actually see a smooth
[57:24] transition, not this like
[57:26] hyperinflationary apocalyptic fiat
[57:29] collapse. And I know that a lot of
[57:31] Bitcoiners want to see like the fiat
[57:33] system destroyed. Well, I think Bitcoin
[57:36] is destroying it, but at the same time,
[57:38] it's almost like stabilizing it. Like I
[57:41] think, you know, in 2008, we had the the
[57:42] the banking bailout, right? Well, I
[57:45] think the biggest bailout we've ever had
[57:47] in human history was the one Satoshi
[57:49] gave us. And this vortex of incentives,
[57:52] this thermodynamically sound property,
[57:54] this this this thing that you can
[57:56] custody that is in some sense virtually
[57:59] inviable. Like, I can't get your Bitcoin
[58:01] unless you give it to me, right? And so
[58:03] that that incentive vortex, the monetary
[58:06] properties, the decentralized element of
[58:08] it all, I think that that is um so
[58:12] alluring and so so needed in the world
[58:14] that we have today. And like we for a
[58:17] multitude of reasons, the system has to
[58:18] continue to debase. People want to
[58:20] figure out how to save their economic
[58:21] energy. They want to prevent themselves
[58:23] from being taxed, tariffed, you know,
[58:26] stolen from, all those things. And so
[58:28] that's just like sucking us back down to
[58:30] a hard money standard. And I think that
[58:33] I think that that creates a smooth
[58:35] transition. I don't want to see, you
[58:37] know, a hyperinflationary apocalyptic
[58:40] situation. Like that would be really
[58:41] bad. That would be really really really
[58:44] bad. And so the more I think about it, I
[58:46] think that Bitcoin in some ways, and
[58:48] this is controversial you could say, but
[58:50] I think it like fixes the problems that
[58:51] we have in the fiat system, but at the
[58:54] same time that it destroys and replaces
[58:56] Bitcoin or excuse me, fiat. So, I don't
[58:59] think that it's like, you know, hey,
[59:01] we're going to be in for this
[59:02] apocalyptic collapse. I actually think
[59:04] that it brings stability. Um, and it it
[59:07] allows us to transition in a smooth way.
[59:09] At least I like to think that because it
[59:11] feels good, you know, but also from a
[59:13] logical sense, theoretically it makes it
[59:15] it does seem to be what will play out.
[59:17] You know, what was it? SAB 121 uh was I
[59:22] think it was the SEC. You might know
[59:23] this better than than me, but I think
[59:25] that SAB SAB 121 was rescended. Um, and
[59:30] SAB 121 from my understanding meant that
[59:33] banks couldn't hold digital assets
[59:36] really aka Bitcoin without having the
[59:38] cash equivalent on reserve. So, it was
[59:41] like a huge deterrent to prevent the
[59:44] financial institutions from interfacing
[59:47] with or holding any any Bitcoin. Now
[59:49] that that's changed, it seems that we're
[59:51] we're moving towards you being able to
[59:54] borrow against your Bitcoin, get fiat,
[59:57] spin up that liquidity with JP Morgan,
[59:59] Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America,
[60:02] whatever that and then you also have
[60:03] this interesting dynamic that plays out
[60:06] where
[60:07] uh prices fall to the marginal cost of
[60:09] production. Well, what's the marginal
[60:11] cost of production to produce fiat if
[60:14] you're JP Morgan Chase? Zero. what you
[60:17] know like 30 you know what is it a half
[60:19] a second for somebody to just click
[60:21] enter on a computer and spin that
[60:23] liquidity up create those monetary units
[60:26] so currently you can borrow against your
[60:27] Bitcoin with some of these lending
[60:29] platforms which I think are amazing but
[60:31] the interest rates are kind of high
[60:33] because they don't they're not the
[60:34] financial institutions that can
[60:36] effectively create money right so
[60:38] they're getting getting capital from
[60:40] people who have capital who are trying
[60:42] to figure out how to get 10% return on
[60:46] it or whatever it is. So, they'll give
[60:47] their capital to, let's say, Letin,
[60:49] whatever the numbers are. I could be
[60:50] wrong about it, but let's say, hey, hey,
[60:52] you can invest with Letin, you could
[60:53] give them your US dollars and Letin will
[60:55] loan them out against Bitcoin. Let's
[60:57] going to charge 15% or 12%. They're
[61:00] going to give the original investor 8 or
[61:02] 10%. They're going to capture that that
[61:04] difference. But when you have JP Morgan
[61:07] Chase come in and Wells Fargo and all
[61:08] these individuals, there's competition
[61:10] to figure out how to capture that
[61:12] Bitcoin. The marginal cost production of
[61:14] the fiat is zero. the system as a whole
[61:17] has to figure out how to inject more
[61:19] monet monetary units into the
[61:21] marketplace. So, I see this like once
[61:22] again, it's like another incentive
[61:24] vortex where I believe that you're going
[61:26] to be able to borrow against your
[61:27] Bitcoin and the interest rates that
[61:28] you're going to be able to do so are
[61:30] going to be decreasing over time. And
[61:32] that will, as counterintuitive as it
[61:35] seems, stabilize the system because of
[61:37] the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is
[61:40] will be increasing at such a
[61:42] infantessimally slow rate. And then so
[61:45] in turn over time theoretically the
[61:47] debasement required to keep the system
[61:49] solvent decreases aka Bitcoin could
[61:52] potentially decrease the need for the
[61:55] inflation for the whole thing to stay
[61:56] solvent. I don't know if that makes
[61:58] sense, but kind of abstract and out
[62:01] there a little bit, but yeah.
[62:04] So, this is basically how you see
[62:07] medium-term but long-term still Bitcoin
[62:11] replacing also the fiat currency of of
[62:15] Yeah, I think that like you know like
[62:17] Sailor said um all the currencies will
[62:21] collapse into the dollar and and why is
[62:24] that? That's because the other the other
[62:27] currencies globally are inflating. The
[62:30] supply is increasing at a faster rate
[62:32] than the dollar. If you're in Venezuela,
[62:34] you'd rather have dollars than Venezuela
[62:37] Boulevard or pesos. I think it's
[62:38] Boloulevard. Um, and all assets,
[62:42] property will collapse into Bitcoin.
[62:44] Like, I'd rather have Bitcoin than
[62:46] houses. I'd rather have Bitcoin than tea
[62:47] bills. I'd rather have Bitcoin than
[62:49] gold. I'd rather have Bitcoin than
[62:50] equities. Right? So, I think that we're
[62:52] going to end up in a in a Bitcoin
[62:54] dominant world over time as far as like
[62:57] a a reserve asset or a savings
[63:00] technology and then people will still be
[63:02] transacting in dollars, especially with
[63:04] um uh stable coins, it it's going to
[63:07] make it easier for the dollar to become
[63:10] maintain its position as the global
[63:12] reserve currency. But then in the United
[63:15] States, if the United States government
[63:16] has Bitcoin on the balance sheet, if the
[63:18] financial institutions have it on the
[63:20] balance sheet and it's collateralizing
[63:21] the debt, it theoretically could slow
[63:24] the debasement required of the currency
[63:26] to keep the system solvent could slow
[63:28] that down. And then it's like at some
[63:31] point, who knows, maybe it's 50 years
[63:33] from now, 100 years from now, let's say
[63:35] it's Baron Trump, you know, Trump's
[63:36] youngest child. Maybe, you know, you got
[63:39] a president at some point in the future
[63:40] that's like, hey, you know what? um we
[63:43] actually could just transact in Bitcoin.
[63:46] It'll be free of t capital gains tax,
[63:49] then you know that would be a catalyst
[63:50] for people to be moving their Bitcoin
[63:52] around more often. You could go buy cups
[63:54] of coffee in it and whatever. And I
[63:56] think there's another thing, you know,
[63:57] that ties into that with like the
[63:59] accounting tools that are getting, you
[64:01] know, integrated into these platforms.
[64:03] Like with Strike, like I can I can
[64:05] deposit dollars into Strike. I can go
[64:08] buy a cup of coffee at the farmers
[64:10] market in Elzante in El Salvador. I can
[64:13] send the dollars. Strike converts them
[64:15] to SATs immediately. I pay the
[64:18] individual in SAT. So now I can actually
[64:20] spend Bitcoin without the taxable event.
[64:22] And I think a lot more of that is
[64:24] coming. And so I just do think at some
[64:26] point though we'll just have have a time
[64:29] where there will there will just be this
[64:32] like shift where it's like okay well
[64:33] Bitcoin is is now tax-free. there's no
[64:36] capital gains, you can spend it. Um,
[64:39] yeah. So, I kind of just see it
[64:40] replacing fiat but in this slow and
[64:43] cohesive and like, you know, this this
[64:46] like I don't know positive transition.
[64:49] Um, yeah, I hope that makes sense. It it
[64:52] totally makes sense and I think this is
[64:54] also the way to go. I I have, as you
[64:59] also mentioned, I have two different
[65:00] kind of guests usually. I mean, maybe
[65:03] three. There are some that say fear will
[65:06] never go away. Uh then there are some as
[65:08] you said like it will be a slow and
[65:10] steady organic transition. It will
[65:12] actually in the medium term benefits the
[65:14] the especially the US dollar. And then
[65:18] there's the other cohort which is uh
[65:21] from just from the numbers a little bit
[65:24] smaller cohort that says oh no like all
[65:26] field will collapse in fill in the blank
[65:29] year. So like in three years, six years,
[65:32] say different years, which is I I really
[65:36] don't like that idea. I can imagine it.
[65:40] Uh but but I really I I always make the
[65:43] Titanic comparison. If if we say that
[65:47] the Fiat system is the Titanic and it's
[65:50] it's really bad and we have this great
[65:52] other boat where everything is amazing
[65:55] and we already on there but there's
[65:57] family members still on on the Titanic.
[66:00] We want the Titanic to sink very slowly
[66:03] and and get everyone across the across
[66:06] the the the savings boats and get to to
[66:09] the bigger better boat that won't sink
[66:12] which is Bitcoin.
[66:14] So that that's where uh my mind always
[66:17] goes. I I I want that world and I'm a
[66:21] very optimistic person also. So I I see
[66:23] that and I'm I'm think the the world
[66:26] will be amazing in the
[66:28] future. But let's play with that thought
[66:31] just for a moment. What do you think
[66:33] will happen if for example Fiat
[66:35] collapses or is that even possible in
[66:38] like 1 2 3 years? Is that even something
[66:41] that that theoretically could even
[66:44] happen? Because fear has this massive
[66:46] network effect and money it sticks with
[66:49] people. People still use Facebook with
[66:52] the network effect and money has a way
[66:54] bigger network effect than than an app
[66:56] has on on your phone. Um I you know I I
[66:59] think anything's possible. I just don't
[67:01] think it's likely. Um yeah, I don't
[67:04] think it's likely. I think that you know
[67:06] we're going to see interest rates
[67:09] reduced. I think that we're going to see
[67:11] the the monetary supply, the currency
[67:14] supply increase. Um, but as that
[67:17] happens, I think that, you know,
[67:19] obviously asset prices are going to go
[67:20] up, housing's going to go up, you know,
[67:22] food's going to go up, things are going
[67:24] to go up. But I think that the, you
[67:25] know, like pain is life's greatest
[67:28] teacher. So I think that the more
[67:31] economic pain people feel, the more of a
[67:34] need they have to figure out how to not
[67:37] feel that pain. So, like the worse it
[67:40] gets, the more it's going to drive
[67:43] people in, you know, to look for a way
[67:46] to escape that that those challenging
[67:48] circumstances. Um, you know, I'm not uh
[67:53] an economist or a banker, you know, I'm
[67:57] just a dude. I'm I've been an
[67:58] entrepreneur and cannabis farmer and
[68:00] whatnot. So, I don't know. you don't
[68:02] have an intimate understanding of how
[68:03] everything works necessarily, but I I
[68:06] just I I don't see some some epically
[68:10] terrible fiat collapse. I I I just
[68:13] don't. And like, you know, I said that,
[68:15] you know, as well, it's like Bitcoin is
[68:16] an escape valve for the debasement. And
[68:20] I think that the faster that the
[68:22] debasement happens, the harder the
[68:24] Bitcoin price rips. And as painful as
[68:27] this can be for people who understand
[68:29] Bitcoin, you know, it's like that meme.
[68:31] It's like you got one guy standing
[68:33] there, what is it? Uh one guy standing
[68:36] there to buy Bitcoin at 80K and at 125
[68:39] grand you got a line out the
[68:42] door. So if if there's like a huge print
[68:45] and asset prices rip, Bitcoin rips, then
[68:48] that's going to bring more people into
[68:49] Bitcoin. So it's just like I'm I'm not
[68:51] too concerned about it. I mean it is it
[68:53] is a a logical concern but um and maybe
[68:57] it's just the optimism and like you know
[69:00] whatever but I don't really see us
[69:02] having some super epically uh bad
[69:06] hyperinflationary event at least not in
[69:09] not with the dollar or the euro um you
[69:13] know and what so the like tether is
[69:16] buying tea bills um so it's like as as
[69:20] people are buying tether you know
[69:22] They're buying stable coins. They're
[69:24] they're buying T bills. There seems to
[69:25] be this interesting thing where like
[69:27] it's all and and Bitcoin, right? Isn't
[69:29] how they're buying Bitcoin? They are
[69:32] buying Bitcoin. Yeah. Like a lot of it,
[69:34] right? So, it seems to be no matter how
[69:37] things are going, it's just driving
[69:39] people and institutions into Bitcoin.
[69:43] Um, yeah. I also heard recently, maybe
[69:46] you know this, I could be wrong, but a
[69:48] very credible friend of mine said that
[69:49] there was uh it was it the CEO of Tether
[69:54] um said that they're going to start
[69:57] working on working they're working on c
[70:00] on putting tether on the lightning
[70:03] network which I don't know if that's
[70:05] true or not but once again
[70:08] Bitcoin. Yeah. So if that's the case,
[70:10] then you're strengthening the the layer
[70:12] two and it's like, you know, all roads
[70:15] lead to Bitcoin.
[70:17] They have Teda apparently with the date
[70:20] with the 31st of March 2025, they have
[70:23] over 100,000 Bitcoin on the balance
[70:26] sheets apparently uh according to
[70:28] Bitcoin treasures treasuries by Bit Po.
[70:31] Yeah. Interesting. So the way I see that
[70:35] though is is Bitcoin is, you know,
[70:37] becoming the underlying asset that's
[70:41] collateralizing the debt based currency,
[70:43] right? So like Tether's issuing these
[70:46] these digital dollars um and they're
[70:49] buying Bitcoin with it. So they're
[70:51] stabilizing, you know, the system and
[70:53] then they're buying T bills with it. So
[70:55] they're helping the government continue
[70:56] to operate. But it's like it's it's this
[70:58] intersection between fiat and Bitcoin.
[71:01] And and once again, I could be totally
[71:03]  wrong about all of this, but I
[71:06] do every time I think about it, um I
[71:09] just do see this like smooth, peaceful
[71:11] transition that that um incentive vortex
[71:15] is just drawing Bitcoin into every facet
[71:17] of our life. And as controversial as it
[71:18] is, I know a lot of people are like,
[71:20] "Isn't Bitcoin supposed to destroy the
[71:22] government?" You know, like we don't
[71:23] want the government to buy Bitcoin.
[71:26] Well, I get that. But like without the
[71:29] government, you know, like the
[71:30] government currently, like if we let's
[71:32] say so we had some apocalyptic collapse,
[71:35] it's Mad Max. What would happen? Well, I
[71:39] believe that what ended up happening is
[71:41] it was you would have people in
[71:43] jurisdictions and little areas,
[71:45] whatever. They would band together.
[71:47] They'd figure out who was the most
[71:49] intelligent and who they felt was the
[71:51] most honest and, you know, whatever.
[71:54] They'd put these people into positions
[71:55] of power. They would then pull capital
[71:58] together and then they would pay for
[71:59] things like roads and clean water. So
[72:02] you would end up reorganizing around
[72:04] some sort of governing entity. But
[72:07] without the governing entity being able
[72:09] to print currency, then they're fiscally
[72:12] responsible and they're beholden to the
[72:14] preferences of their citizens and the
[72:16] people who are supporting them. So I
[72:18] don't think that we want to see the
[72:19] government like completely fail. Like it
[72:22] wouldn't be good. people would be
[72:24] looting in the streets. People would be
[72:26] getting killed and stolen from. And so I
[72:29] that's why I think it's it's prudent for
[72:30] us to figure out how, you know, we can
[72:33] transition into a Bitcoin standard with
[72:35] as little collateral damage, as little
[72:38] problems as possible cuz I personally
[72:41] don't want to see people suffer, you
[72:44] know, and if the government, you know,
[72:46] collapses and fiat collapses and
[72:48] hyperinflates, like a lot of people are
[72:49] going to suffer.
[72:51] I think so, too. And we we we don't want
[72:55] that at all. Nobody should nobody should
[72:58] cheer for for that. I think it's there's
[73:01] something wrong with with people that
[73:03] cheering for collapses. But um one thing
[73:07] you mentioned and I think it's a really
[73:08] important uh uh topic for Bitcoiners
[73:12] that have now Bitcoin and they don't
[73:14] want to sell but they maybe want to use
[73:15] their Bitcoin. How do you look at
[73:17] borrowing against your Bitcoin? Uh you
[73:20] mentioned the the high interest rates. I
[73:22] also see that a lot of high interest
[73:23] rates and sometimes small durations
[73:26] which is um not not best. Uh but on a on
[73:31] a on a general term how do you look at
[73:34] borrowing against your bitcoin to get
[73:36] fiat to to to live your life without
[73:38] selling bitcoin? Um you know I think
[73:41] there's an uh I think it's logical and
[73:45] rational. I think that people who are
[73:47] doing so should be careful. you know,
[73:49] using leverage with Bitcoin. Like what
[73:51] is um is it Caitlyn Long, what is I
[73:53] believe it's Caitlyn Long, she says a
[73:55] fool and their levered Bitcoin will soon
[73:57] be separated or something like that.
[74:00] Like, so you got to be careful about
[74:02] that one because, you know, you could
[74:03] have a a flash crash and you could have
[74:06] to either pay back the debt or or post
[74:08] more collateral. So, I would say that,
[74:11] you know, you wouldn't want to borrow
[74:13] you wouldn't want to post more than
[74:14] maybe 10% of your Bitcoin as collateral
[74:17] against debt. you know, just to insulate
[74:19] yourself because there's just so much
[74:22] opportunity cost. There's such a big
[74:24] opportunity at hand here. Like holding
[74:26] on to that kind of going back to what we
[74:27] discussed in the beginning, like I've
[74:29] really had to just to get real with
[74:31] myself. It's kind of like a come to
[74:32] Jesus moment. Like dang, I want to just
[74:35] sit here and hold on to my
[74:37] Bitcoin. Like I I have certainty in my
[74:40] little world where I'm at. I'm not
[74:41] really, you know, making very much
[74:43] money, but like I can sustain myself and
[74:46] where I live, doing my thing, and just
[74:48] hold on to this Bitcoin. Um, but then
[74:51] I'm not doing anything, right? And so,
[74:54] like, yeah, it's like, um, you you got
[74:57] to you got to operate through life. You
[74:59] need to go after what you want. You need
[75:01] to be willing to to exert energy, deploy
[75:03] that capital, but you need to obviously
[75:05] be responsible. Um, and you really need
[75:08] to make decisions based upon, you know,
[75:10] the opportunity cost there. Like
[75:12] Bitcoin with a the highest level of
[75:15] probability is going to appreciate at a
[75:17] faster rate than everything else. So you
[75:19] you should definitely be prudent. You
[75:22] should be wise. You should make sure
[75:24] that you're not, you know, fiscally
[75:25] irresponsible or doing anything dumb,
[75:28] right? And I think that, you know,
[75:29] borrowing against too much of your
[75:30] Bitcoin is high risk. You know, that's
[75:32] also why like I don't know. I get people
[75:34] who ask me sometimes like, you know, uh
[75:37] when should I sell my Salana? When do
[75:38] you think I should sell my XRP? I'm like
[75:41] yesterday. Yesterday. You didn't do it
[75:44] yesterday. Well, you should do it today,
[75:45] right? Like it's too big of a risk. Like
[75:48] why? What? Oh, well, maybe it does.
[75:51] Maybe Salana 10x's over the next year,
[75:54] whatever it is, and Bitcoin only 5xes.
[75:56] Well, you have to time that, right? You
[75:58] know, it's a trade. Bitcoin's the final
[76:00] trade, right? So, anything that's
[76:02] outside of holding on to your Bitcoin is
[76:04] risky. So, you really need to take like
[76:06] a, you know, a very conservative
[76:09] approach around the risk that you're
[76:10] taking. And so, I think that really ties
[76:12] into like, you know, borrowing against
[76:13] your Bitcoin. You want to make sure you
[76:15] don't get margin called. You won't want
[76:16] to get
[76:16] overleveraged. Um, yeah. And so, like,
[76:20] I'm a little adverse to it. I've had to
[76:21] think about that a little bit myself.
[76:22] Like, I've used creative forms of
[76:24] leverage in my life. you know, as an
[76:25] example, um I bought two cars over the
[76:29] last 5 years, and instead of paying down
[76:32] my auto loans, you know, faster than
[76:35] what the duration of the loan is, I I
[76:37] put the money into Bitcoin. That's
[76:38] interest rate arbitrage. My Bitcoin's
[76:40] been appreciating at whatever 45 50% a
[76:42] year over the last 7 years. And my auto
[76:45] pay, you know, my auto loans, I have one
[76:47] at like I think it's 0.9% and the other
[76:49] one's 3.9%. So, for me to pay down those
[76:53] auto loans quicker as opposed to buying
[76:56] more Bitcoin, I mean, that's obviously
[76:58] not the better move. So, I bought the
[77:00] Bitcoin instead of paying down the auto
[77:02] loans. So, I'm using debt to to get more
[77:05] SATs or to hold on to my SATS, but the
[77:08] Bitcoin is not collateral. It's kind of
[77:09] like when Michael Sailor, and apparently
[77:11] he got a lot of for this, was like,
[77:12] mortgage your house and buy Bitcoin.
[77:15] Well, I mean that makes sense if you
[77:17] have equity in your home and you can you
[77:19] can get a heliloc, you know, at 3, four,
[77:21] five, 6% and you can buy a bitcoin. If
[77:24] the bitcoin price crashes, you have a
[77:26] flash crash, you're not going to get
[77:27] margin called as long as you can you can
[77:31] um uh what is it? Um maintain the debt,
[77:35] you know, or service the debt, then
[77:37] you're good. So you don't want to get
[77:38] out, as they say, don't get out over
[77:40] your skis, you know, cuz you can get
[77:42] margin called and then you're going to
[77:43] you're going to pay the price. Like, you
[77:45] know, with Bitcoin, you around, you
[77:47] find out. So I would suggest suggest
[77:49] everybody just be real conservative
[77:51] because there's enormous opportunity
[77:52] cost there. You you never want to lose
[77:54] your Bitcoin because you were too greedy
[77:57] with with holding on to your your
[77:59] Bitcoin and you leveraged up too much.
[78:02] Really cool. Um I have I have one
[78:04] question now. Uh I've not asked it last
[78:06] time. I've I've introduced it later. Uh
[78:09] but I have now one question that I ask
[78:11] each and every one of my guests and the
[78:12] question is what can we learn from you
[78:14] besides Bitcoin?
[78:17] I'll get a little uh metaphysical but I
[78:20] think that we live in you know Nicola
[78:23] Tesla famously said if you want to
[78:24] understand the secrets of the universe
[78:25] you need to think in terms of energy
[78:27] vibration and frequency. And I've had to
[78:29] think very deeply about that myself
[78:31] because I've been kind of carrying this
[78:33] heavy dense energy around in my life.
[78:35] You know, it's like maybe it was fear. I
[78:38] mean, yeah, if you distill it down to
[78:39] the most basic thing, it was just fear,
[78:42] right? And so that's that's low vibes,
[78:44] low vibration, right? It's dense, heavy
[78:47] energy. And I think that a high
[78:49] vibrational frequency is your ability to
[78:52] oscillate the
[78:56] frequency. High vibrational frequency is
[78:58] your ability to oscillate the energy at
[79:01] a higher frequency. So you can move
[79:03] through energy at a higher frequency.
[79:05] That's raising the vibes. And I think
[79:08] that we, you know, I think about the law
[79:10] of attraction a lot and quantum physics
[79:12] and the double slit experiment and the
[79:14] observer affecting reality. Think about
[79:17] simulation theory like are we all are we
[79:19] in a simulation? You know the idea with
[79:21] simulation theory is is that at some
[79:24] point with technological advancement,
[79:26] computing power, all these things, it's
[79:28] logical to think that at some point we
[79:30] will be able to create a simulation uh a
[79:33] simulated reality that's
[79:34] indistinguishable from base reality. And
[79:36] if that's actually the case, then it's
[79:38] not probable we live in base reality,
[79:40] right? So like maybe we live in this
[79:42] computer simulation that's just
[79:44] energybased. And so your energy is very
[79:47] important. Your vibrational frequency is
[79:49] very important. And moving through
[79:51] energy, at least I believe this I'm
[79:53] starting to think about it at a higher
[79:56] frequency is that raising of your
[79:58] vibrational frequency. I think that you
[80:01] get what you put out. I think that your
[80:04] your vibrational
[80:08] frequency being mirrored to you and the
[80:11] world around you. And so I think that if
[80:14] you can step outside of that vibration
[80:18] of fear and you can you know and through
[80:21] logic and this is what Bitcoin is such a
[80:23] beautiful catalyst for like raising
[80:25] one's vibrational frequency through
[80:27] eliminating fear. You're less fearful.
[80:29] Hey, I have this monetary instrument
[80:30] that can't be debased. It can't be
[80:32] stolen. Whatever. Like you're much more
[80:34] safe. So you're much more calm. Your
[80:35] cortisol levels decrease. In some sense
[80:38] it's like upregulating your genetic
[80:40] code. like, you know, when you think
[80:42] about epigenetics, if you're if you're
[80:44] really scared all the time and you're
[80:45] you're you're not doing well, like you
[80:47] can physically make yourself sick. And
[80:50] so, I just, you know, I would suggest
[80:52] that people be conscious of the energy
[80:55] that they're exuding. Be conscious of
[80:58] your thoughts. I think your thoughts
[80:59] really affect your reality, your belief
[81:02] system. Like, I think that what you
[81:04] believe about yourself and about the
[81:06] world has a real effect on what you
[81:09] create in your life. I think that like
[81:11] we're we are an extension of source or
[81:14] God energy and we live in this
[81:16] energybased reality. We're just
[81:18] channeling energy. And so if you can do
[81:21] so in a loving and more fearless manner,
[81:23] I believe that's at like a higher octave
[81:25] or a higher vibrational frequency,
[81:27] you're going to attract more positive
[81:29] outcomes. You know, it's like the common
[81:31] common thing like we've all experienced
[81:33] this like you're a little t tired. You
[81:36] wake up, maybe you're late and then
[81:38] you're like getting out of bed and you
[81:40] stub your toe and you're like ah and
[81:42] you're all pissed and then maybe you say
[81:43] something shitty to your wife and she
[81:45] barks back at you and you're and I got
[81:47] to go do this thing that I hate
[81:49] and then you get into your car and you
[81:51] spill your coffee on your lap. Like I
[81:53] think that that's like low vibes, bad
[81:55] vibes, like creating bad experiences in
[81:58] your
[81:59] reality. So at least me personally, I
[82:01] make sure I put a very lot of thought
[82:04] and a and an an enormous conscious
[82:06] effort on making sure that I'm like
[82:09] doing things that I'm coming from a
[82:12] place of love. I'm I'm trying to be as
[82:14] fearless as possible. I'm confronting
[82:16] fear from a logical and rational place.
[82:19] I'm keeping the vibes high and I'm
[82:21] trying to do so I'm doing that in an
[82:24] attempt to like create a more positive
[82:25] experience for myself. And so think
[82:27] about that energy, vibration, and
[82:29] frequency. And you know like Bitcoin is
[82:31] a is a high vibrational frequency asset.
[82:34] You can oscillate the energy at a high
[82:36] frequency. It's invisible. You can send
[82:39] it around the world, zip it around. Like
[82:41] I think that there's something very
[82:43] special about that. And I think that
[82:45] it's like raising the frequency and the
[82:48] consciousness of our civilization or of
[82:51] this reality. And if you embody that and
[82:55] it's like that's anyway I think you know
[82:56] you could attest to this like there's
[82:58] something very magical happening with
[83:01] Bitcoiners and the Bitcoin community
[83:03] like people are becoming happier. Seems
[83:05] like time is almost speeding up in some
[83:08] ways like there we're creating more like
[83:10] the the there's more love. It's like
[83:13] it's ch it seems to be affecting our
[83:15] reality in a very interesting and
[83:17] metaphysical and magical way. And so
[83:20] yeah, high vibes it's it's super
[83:22] important. I know that's a little, you
[83:24] know, woo woo, but like yeah, you know,
[83:26] your ability to oscillate the energy at
[83:28] a higher frequency, at least in my
[83:31] experience and enhancing the quality of
[83:33] my life.
[83:36] I think energy matters a lot. I I I have
[83:40] that so many times and I have like
[83:42] probably 50,000 small examples of that.
[83:46] But every time my or especially with the
[83:50] girlfriend I know because when you live
[83:52] alone maybe you you don't notice it uh
[83:54] that much but especially if you live
[83:56] with someone else and and you probably
[83:58] can attest to that. Uh I've now lived
[84:01] for one year together and I've never
[84:03] lived with someone else before except my
[84:05] parents. Uh, and now I live with my
[84:09] girlfriend together. And having um a
[84:12] mirror of if you are not good, she
[84:16] immediately noticed.
[84:19] And also, if I'm not good and she has
[84:22] really good vibes, my mood immediately
[84:25] gets better. I get there and she's like,
[84:28] "Oh, it's really good." But the same
[84:30] same for the other way around. She gets
[84:32] back from a long work and maybe has some
[84:35] some weird day, there's some some bad
[84:36] day. She comes home like, "Oh, like all
[84:39] of the sudden I feel way better because
[84:40] energy is good because you had a good
[84:42] day." So, I think energy matters way
[84:45] more that than we we would like to
[84:47] think. Uh, and and so it it's it's
[84:50] important to to keep that wipe and that
[84:53] fire and that that energy as uplifting
[84:56] as possible. Um it came quite naturally
[84:59] for me usually because I'm extremely
[85:01] positive person. I tend to say yes to
[85:04] everything
[85:05] which which resulted in that podcast I
[85:08] said yes too many times. Uh but it's
[85:11] it's it's it's very important uh that
[85:13] that energy. I think it's a it's a whole
[85:15] another podcast. Maybe it's maybe we can
[85:17] touch on it in the in the in the third
[85:20] round with you. I think that that's an
[85:22] amazing thing. Um I have Yeah. Sorry.
[85:25] you want to say something? Uh, I just
[85:27] want to add to that, you know,
[85:29] gratitude, you know, I I implement a
[85:31] gratitude practice, especially when I'm
[85:33] like experiencing challenging times and
[85:35] I've and it's and I've been really
[85:36] thinking consciously about it a lot for
[85:38] the last 1015 years of my life. But as
[85:40] soon as I get confronted with something
[85:42] that I'm adverse to, uh, I just
[85:45] implement that gratitude practice. You
[85:47] know, you could actually be you could
[85:49] experience a problem in your life and
[85:51] you could think to yourself like, I got
[85:52] this problem. It's a challenge. I don't
[85:54] necessarily like this. But then you
[85:56] could immediately be like, you know
[85:58] what? I'm actually grateful for this
[85:59] problem. And because I I could have a
[86:01] lot worse problems. And you could always
[86:03] have a worse problem. I mean, you could
[86:05] be dead. Like that's the worst problem
[86:07] you could have is you could die, right?
[86:08] So if you're not dead, you could think,
[86:09] okay, well, it's the duality of life as
[86:11] well. Like you can't have sweet without
[86:13] bitter. You can't have light without
[86:14] dark. You can't have pleasure without
[86:16] pain. So if I'm experiencing problems in
[86:18] my life, especially if they're problems
[86:19] that are easily solvable, then like I
[86:22] don't get frustrated by them. I'm like,
[86:23] "Oh, actually, I'm grateful for this
[86:25] because you have to have problems. This
[86:28] is a problem I can solve." And that's
[86:30] like transmutation of the negative
[86:32] energy. Well, now instead of being like
[86:34] all up over the problem that you
[86:35] have, it's like, "Okay, well, I can deal
[86:36] with this. I'm grateful. I can I can
[86:39] confront this headon. It's it's it's
[86:41] very proactive." And now you're going
[86:43] through that experience at a different
[86:46] vibrational frequency. And like, you
[86:49] know, when you're scared or you're
[86:50] dealing with challenges, you know, you
[86:52] could be grateful for that fear, those
[86:54] challenges. Like, and when I'm scared of
[86:56] something, I'll actually tell this to
[86:57] myself. I'll be like, you know what?
[86:58] Thank you for the fear. I'll think to
[87:00] myself like, oh, I'm grateful for this
[87:01] fear because it's shedding light on some
[87:03] sort of limiting belief that I have,
[87:06] right? And so, that's a transmutation of
[87:08] that fear for with with love,
[87:11] essentially, gratitude and love. And so
[87:14] those are the, you know, the things that
[87:15] I think about and some of the practices
[87:17] that I implement in my life that really
[87:19] help me. Um, at the ve I think it it's
[87:22] helping the quality of my life
[87:24] experience and and what I'm creating for
[87:26] myself in this existence. But at the
[87:29] very least, what I can say with um 100%
[87:33] certainty is it makes me feel better,
[87:36] right? And isn't that the most important
[87:37] thing? Like how do you feel? Like
[87:39] everyone wants to feel better. And so
[87:42] gratitude practice, being aware of your
[87:43] vibes, being aware of where your
[87:45] attention goes. You know, if you get
[87:47] online, like I, you know, I I watch a
[87:49] lot of YouTube. I don't watch any
[87:51] mainstream media, but there's actually
[87:52] now a lot of mainstream media on
[87:54] YouTube. And I'll see stuff like, you
[87:56] know, Redacted is a good example as a
[87:58] channel that's like shedding light on
[87:59] all the corruption and atrocities taking
[88:01] place in the world. And so I kind of
[88:03] like to avoid that. Like I don't
[88:05] completely bury my head in the sand, but
[88:07] I pay attention like okay well like you
[88:09] know Putin did this, North Korea got
[88:11] this thing going on and Biden and Camala
[88:14] and Trump or whatever all the stuff like
[88:16] you got to be aware of what's happening
[88:17] in the world but don't let it consume
[88:18] you. And so be careful about how much of
[88:20] the negative stuff that you're paying
[88:22] attention to because I think it can
[88:24] affect your vibes. it can pull her into
[88:26] pull you into a a lower denser state of
[88:30] of being and then in turn I think you're
[88:33] creating more negative things in your
[88:35] life but at the very least you don't
[88:37] feel good right and so I think everybody
[88:39] wants to feel good so be grateful you
[88:41] know it's just a simple simple shift in
[88:43] perspective I've implemented
[88:46] because I I was so far away from
[88:49] mainstream media that people came up to
[88:52] me oh like what do you think about that
[88:53] and that and I had no clue clue what's
[88:55] going on at all. Like I barely realized
[88:59] when uh Russia Ukraine happened uh that
[89:02] there's something going on. I I I
[89:04] realized it months later because
[89:06] everyone was talking about it. I was
[89:08] like what Ukraine Russia the fighting I
[89:11] didn't knew that this was a time where I
[89:13] was so far away that that might also not
[89:16] be the best thing. I now have
[89:18] implemented a 10-minute maximum
[89:20] mainstream media per day and it turns
[89:22] out you don't need more. You you
[89:23] definitely Yeah, I can see that 10
[89:26] minutes is almost too much already. I
[89:28] have my Austrian mainstream media
[89:30] channel, uh, one, two, three, uh, and
[89:32] just flick through them and what they're
[89:34] talking about. They usually have like a
[89:36] morning and evening show and and I just
[89:37] flick through the topics. They're
[89:39] actually really nice. They have always
[89:40] nice topics lined up. So, you don't have
[89:43] to watch 10 minutes. You just like read
[89:44] the headline and like, okay, that's
[89:46] interesting. Let's let's listen one
[89:48] minute what they have to say. So I I
[89:50] just used that selectively 10 minutes
[89:53] per day and and see what's going on. Uh
[89:57] and honestly mostly I just regret it.
[90:00] It's like there's no value coming out of
[90:02] there. There's nothing going on. It does
[90:05] nothing for me. Uh so I'm even thinking
[90:07] of deleting that 10 minutes and just
[90:09] doing 10 minutes per week because it's
[90:11] all tutorials enough. Uh but yeah, it's
[90:15] it's
[90:17] it's consuming
[90:19] negative watching what you consume not
[90:22] just with like food is really important.
[90:25] Consuming what thoughts come into your
[90:27] head, what channels are you watching,
[90:30] what uh Twitter feed is feeding you. I'm
[90:34] a big fan of making lists on Twitter
[90:36] with people you actually want to follow
[90:38] and then just see those feed just see
[90:40] those lists and not your for you feed or
[90:43] just like deleting Twitter altogether
[90:45] but it seems to be a hard choice. Uh so
[90:48] I I I you really have to be conscious
[90:50] about your energy. Yeah. Uh it's like
[90:52] what you feed your mind. You want you
[90:54] want to your mind you want to avoid
[90:56] toxic information, you know. You want to
[90:59] you want to have uh nutritious healthy
[91:02] information if that makes any sense. But
[91:05] yeah, that's real. I totally agree with
[91:07] that.
[91:09] Awesome. Yeah, really really cool. We
[91:10] have as you know uh an end routine in
[91:13] the podcast uh where the previous guest
[91:15] is asking a question for the next guest
[91:17] without knowing who the next guest
[91:18] actually is. And uh you're probably very
[91:22] well well aware of that. Satoshi once
[91:25] said, "I've moved on to other things."
[91:27] And the previous guest uh wants to ask
[91:30] you, "What do you think Satoshi moved on
[91:32] to?" That's a really good question. I
[91:35] don't know. You know, there's part of me
[91:36] that wonders at times if if Satoshi, you
[91:39] know, I mean, gosh, this whole myth of
[91:41] Satoshi is so fascinating. I I think
[91:43] that we're going to celebrate him as
[91:46] like a Jesus like figure. you know, in
[91:50] in the future. So, yeah. I don't know. I
[91:52] would I it's a good question. You know,
[91:55] if he's a human and
[91:58] um I would assume he's still out there
[92:01] cuz this individual was very smart and
[92:05] he's probably just enjoying his life.
[92:07] Like, of course, he he so he mined all
[92:09] these coins, right? Like what it's said
[92:11] to be like a million or 1.1 million
[92:13] coins and he's never moved them, right?
[92:16] Well, if he's a a human, I think that he
[92:20] would have just started mining coins
[92:24] that aren't those original coins, and he
[92:26] could be an anonymous, very wealthy
[92:29] Bitcoin whale just enjoying his life
[92:31] somewhere in the world. And I think that
[92:33] that's actually probably the the more
[92:35] likely um situation. He created this
[92:39] thing. He knew enough about what he was
[92:41] doing that he knew he had to to get the
[92:43] protocol up and going, that immaculate
[92:45] conception. He had to do the things that
[92:47] he did in order for that to be the case.
[92:49] And then he could have still interfaced
[92:51] with the Bitcoin network and mind a
[92:52] bunch of coins on a laptop like a lot of
[92:55] people did. And he could be a
[92:56] multi-billionaire somewhere just living
[92:58] anonymously, enjoying his life. I don't
[93:01] think he'll ever resurface if he's
[93:03] alive. Um, so I think he's probably an
[93:05] anonymous Bitcoin whale living his life,
[93:08] you know, probably a high quality
[93:09] existence somewhere in the world. Um,
[93:13] and he probably feels pretty good about
[93:14] the fact that he pretty much changed
[93:17] everything and and kind of saved our
[93:19] civilization.
[93:21] That's that's what that's what I think
[93:22] Satoshi's doing if he's still around.
[93:26] Just enjoying the stack.
[93:29] Yeah, a big big stack. It's actually
[93:31] something that um I always tell people
[93:34] uh if they are afraid of oh what if if
[93:38] Satoshi comes back first of all like I
[93:40] don't think the keys to his key to his
[93:42] bitcoins exist anymore of like the first
[93:44] 1 million. I think this was very uh
[93:47] intentional that they will not move and
[93:49] I think he just destroyed that key.
[93:52] Yeah. At the same time he mined or like
[93:54] got got in another way
[93:57] Bitcoin and just you can throw one
[94:00] million Bitcoin and mine like 200,000 in
[94:03] the next week at that point. Exactly. It
[94:05] was not hard. So I think that's
[94:08] something that he definitely uh did do
[94:11] and it's just so fascinating. Yeah,
[94:14] there are entire books uh around the who
[94:17] who it is, who it might be and and how
[94:20] he wrote the emails and it's it's it's a
[94:23] fascinating topic, but at the same time,
[94:25] it really doesn't matter. Totally. Yeah,
[94:29] I I totally agree. Um before I let you
[94:32] go, Eric, where can people find you? Ask
[94:35] your questions and and and see uh where
[94:38] you moved on to next. Yeah, I'm on I'm
[94:40] on X uh Eric V
[94:43] Stacks. Um yeah, you can you can reach
[94:46] out to me there. I haven't been making a
[94:49] lot of content recently. I think that's
[94:50] going to be changing here in the near
[94:52] future. Um like I said, I'm working on
[94:54] some things. I'm looks like I'm moving
[94:56] to Miami here pretty soon. And so yeah,
[95:00] I'll be on X and you know, I got a bunch
[95:02] more interviews uh lined up over the
[95:05] next few months. And so, yeah, I'll be
[95:08] around enjoying my Bitcoin, trying to
[95:10] figure out how to create the most
[95:12] positive life experience that I can for
[95:14] myself and in turn others.
[95:17] Awesome. Thank you so much, Eric, for
[95:18] being on. Also, thank you so much for
[95:20] everyone that is watching and listening,
[95:22] for joining us today. As always, I'll be
[95:24] back tomorrow with another episode.
[95:26] Bye-bye.
