[00:00] all you really need to know is is demand
[00:02] increasing and everywhere you look that
[00:04] answer has to be yes so when you've got
[00:06] a fixed Supply and you see look around
[00:08] and everywhere you turn you see demand
[00:10] is increasing you know that results in
[00:12] number go up when we see a big drop we
[00:14] don't care we don't give a we're
[00:15] doubling down on the price we're looking
[00:17] under the couch for the spare change
[00:18] trying to trying to see if we can buy
[00:20] the dip because we we know what this
[00:22] thing is and we know eventually you zoom
[00:24] back out you adjust your time Horizon
[00:26] you know that it will improve your
[00:28] lifestyle dramatically Bitcoin is the
[00:30] only currency globally where real
[00:32] estate's going down if I was going to
[00:34] sell Bitcoin all I would want to do is
[00:35] buy more Bitcoin when I get more Feld I
[00:37] look around I go what am I going to do
[00:39] with this Feld where do I want to park
[00:40] this where is going to perform best and
[00:42] it's Bitcoin every single time
[00:43] diminishing returns no I don't think
[00:45] we're going to see that I think we're
[00:46] going to just continue to see an
[00:48] acceleration of adoption we finally fix
[00:49] the money it's fite it's durable it's
[00:51] portable all of those things Bitcoin
[00:53] solves to a
[00:54] [Music]
[00:58] te what do you expect for this year like
[01:01] 2025 why why is Bitcoin important for
[01:03] 2025 what do you expect for Bitcoin this
[01:06] year well what an awesome question I
[01:08] think um all bets are off this year I I
[01:11] I quite often sit here to myself
[01:14] thinking and and talk to friends and
[01:16] talk to other bitcoiners in the space
[01:18] and it it there's a real lot of unknowns
[01:21] you know um one one thing I think we can
[01:23] all sort of settle on is that we we
[01:25] expect number go up right and um the
[01:28] thesis really for for me I just keep
[01:30] coming back down to fundamentals is when
[01:33] you look at when you have a finite
[01:35] supply of something when you have a any
[01:37] Market good right that the price for a
[01:39] market Goods always met at the
[01:40] equilibrium between the supply and the
[01:43] demand and with the Bitcoin thesis it's
[01:45] really quite simple you don't have to be
[01:48] really thinking about what's happening
[01:49] in the space if Trump's going to sign an
[01:52] executive order day one any of this
[01:54] thing all you really need to know is you
[01:56] peel back the layers and you go is
[01:58] demand increasing and everywhere you
[02:01] look that answer has to be yes and we
[02:03] know the issuance rate so when you've
[02:05] got a fixed Supply know issuance rate to
[02:08] a ma you know a market cap and you see
[02:11] look around and everywhere you turn you
[02:13] see demand is increasing you know that
[02:16] results in number go
[02:18] up that's and I think that the point of
[02:22] us never ever had to have like we never
[02:27] had digital scarce money that's globally
[02:29] available
[02:30] that everyone can have and everyone has
[02:33] a reason to to adopt this thing so
[02:36] demand is basically unlimited and Supply
[02:39] is strictly scarce and it's not it's
[02:41] capped and it's not able to to widen out
[02:45] and this combination we never had
[02:47] anywhere comparable in the in in in the
[02:49] history we had gold but that's
[02:52] completely different because when you
[02:54] have a higher price you have an
[02:55] incentive to dig out more gold so you
[02:58] expand the gold Supply with that so
[02:59] there's some controls in there you can
[03:01] also manipulate gold a little bit easier
[03:03] the price uh than than you can do with
[03:06] Bitcoin uh so there are a lot of things
[03:09] that we we just don't know like that's
[03:12] why I'm always like if someone says to
[03:14] me like oh the britcoin price will be
[03:15] that or that I'm like yeah maybe I have
[03:18] no clue like I I can believe you I can
[03:20] also not believe you I I definitely
[03:22] cannot uh prove you anything I I cannot
[03:25] say like you are wrong I could just say
[03:28] like I don't know if you're right so all
[03:31] I think all bets off kind of puts it
[03:33] perfectly um and you uh also like as an
[03:37] electrical electrical engineer you are
[03:40] right you have the background how did
[03:41] this shape your understanding of of of
[03:43] Bitcoin uh deeply actually um having a
[03:46] bit of a tech technical background I
[03:48] tried to break it like so when I first
[03:50] discovered Bitcoin I thought I sort of
[03:52] got the thesis from a value investing
[03:54] lens right so uh I I got the gold thesis
[03:57] and I got the Bitcoin thesis pretty
[03:59] quickly in and money scarce assets what
[04:02] performs in these environments of high
[04:04] inflation low interest rates uh scarce
[04:07] assets you want to hold things that they
[04:08] can't print out of thin air so sort of
[04:10] stumbled across Bitcoin and then being
[04:13] technically minded um and and also when
[04:15] that space like knew a little bit of
[04:17] coding not going to say I'm a prolific
[04:19] coder by any stretch of the imagination
[04:20] but knew enough to be dangerous and um
[04:23] stumbled across Bitcoin and thought well
[04:26] this can't be right like it's got to be
[04:29] hacked it's got to to be you know um
[04:31] there's got to be weaknesses there's got
[04:33] to be attack vectors and so Doug pretty
[04:38] deep down the rabbit hole in terms of
[04:39] the technical just to really get a deep
[04:41] understanding of of what it was CU you
[04:43] know like I said I tried to find the
[04:45] floor tried to find where it could be
[04:47] broken or co-opted or hacked or copied
[04:52] you know and then when you start to come
[04:54] down that thesis you know obviously
[04:55] discover crypto go down a bit of that
[04:57] rabbit hole and then realize come back
[04:59] full circle back to bitcoin really
[05:02] understanding that there was only really
[05:03] one truly scarce truly decentralized
[05:06] money blockchains are very inefficient
[05:09] databases they do one thing and they do
[05:11] one thing very well and that's money and
[05:12] you only need one money um scr's law all
[05:15] you know the the number one money will
[05:17] will win out in the end so it set me up
[05:20] really well I'd say having that
[05:21] technical background it set me up really
[05:24] uh well to receive the message and
[05:26] receive it fairly quickly so I'm only
[05:27] class of 2020 but I fell down that
[05:29] rabbit really hard really quickly and um
[05:32] didn't take me long to uh get myself in
[05:36] a position where I was comfortable
[05:38] having decent exposure to it you know um
[05:41] being a married fellow with with kids uh
[05:44] you know I I still took it from what I
[05:46] would consider a pretty risk adverse way
[05:49] I had to be sure right um but what that
[05:51] allowed me to do is having that deep
[05:54] understanding also then led to pretty
[05:56] quick conviction in and around the asset
[05:58] and I think that's really important for
[06:00] people coming into the space who are
[06:01] dabbling on the side like with this
[06:03] volatility with big Market swings in in
[06:06] in that underlying price performance in
[06:08] in US dollar terms or Aussie dollar
[06:10] terms whatever your denomination is to
[06:13] stomach that at size to have decent
[06:16] exposure to that at you know um and
[06:18] putting yourself out there financially
[06:20] to be able to stomach that volatility
[06:21] you really need that conviction you need
[06:23] to understand what's under the hood you
[06:25] need to understand how it works because
[06:27] when you have these big draw Downs this
[06:28] is why I psycotic Bitcoin is when we see
[06:30] a big drop we don't care we don't give a
[06:32]  we're doubling down on the price
[06:35] we're looking under the couch for the
[06:36] spare change trying to trying to see if
[06:38] we can buy the dip because we we know
[06:40] what this thing is and we know
[06:42] eventually you zoom back out you adjust
[06:44] your time
[06:45] Horizon you know that it will improve
[06:49] your lifestyle dramatically if all you
[06:51] have to do is huddle H and sit there and
[06:53] wait I now get and this might be crazy
[06:56] but I now get anxiety when Bitcoin goes
[06:59] up
[07:01] uh because I get uh most of my income
[07:05] nowadays paid in Bitcoin uh so and it's
[07:09] fixated on an an euro unit of account so
[07:15] if if Bitcoin goes up I just get less
[07:17] Bitcoin it's not that I get a fixed
[07:18] amount of Bitcoin I get a fixed amount
[07:19] of Euros uh and that paid in Bitcoin so
[07:24] when I see a price rising and it's like
[07:27] oh like I get paid in 10 days and it's
[07:29] like oh the price was 93 now it's 102
[07:32] like oh like I really get anxiety
[07:34] when the Bitcoin price goes up if it
[07:35] goes down I'm like oh like is there some
[07:37] with money coming in it's like do I
[07:39] think is that something where where can
[07:42] I push money in so like I even and when
[07:45] I explain to you you probably understand
[07:47] that but if I explain it to someone else
[07:49] in my family or something like that like
[07:51] like why like you're stacking since 2020
[07:54] you're all in since 2021 actually and
[07:58] and still getting sight it goes up
[08:00] because I still have this feeling like
[08:01] oh I don't have enough like I need so
[08:03] much more I'm not not even close to my
[08:05] stack and goal and I think there's never
[08:08] end to to the stacking I feel
[08:11] like yeah I think um PE people you know
[08:13] often say how much money have you made
[08:16] out of Bitcoin it's like well Bitcoin is
[08:17] the money that's I don't care about the
[08:19] fat denomination of it Bitcoin is the
[08:21] money have you not been listening to me
[08:23] the last four years like that's what
[08:24] I've been trying to bang into your thick
[08:26] skull is that change your money and um
[08:29] you know you you want more of that money
[08:31] that's essentially what you want so
[08:33] you're 100% right as your fat
[08:35] denomination uh you know starts to
[08:37] increase you're getting this anxiety
[08:39] because ultimately if you are on a
[08:40] Bitcoin stand you are earning Bitcoin it
[08:42] does ultimately mean less Bitcoin if
[08:45] you're still tethering back to the the
[08:47] Fiat world right absolutely it's also
[08:49] interesting how people see it with the
[08:52] with with the speculated asset because
[08:54] most people uh like just most people on
[08:58] the on the planet see bitco coin either
[09:00] as something speculative a small asset
[09:02] or as a scam still like there's a lot of
[09:05] we we are way earlier than than than we
[09:07] think we are when do you think this this
[09:10] changes or what what needs to happen
[09:13] that people kind of get Bitcoin what
[09:16] what it actually is and what it
[09:17] represents kind of have the uh the
[09:20] understanding of an average bitcoiner
[09:22] right now how long will this take to get
[09:25] this understanding in in in in uh the
[09:28] mass uh Mass
[09:30] Indo yeah I I think what what it takes
[09:33] is sustained inflation I think that's
[09:35] the easy one and and it's it's funny
[09:38] even um you know the most Normy of Norm
[09:41] normies that you that you speak to um
[09:44] you go back five years no one understood
[09:46] what F currency is but it's it's it's
[09:48] crazy to me how common place it's
[09:50] becoming I wouldn't say it's still
[09:52] widespread by any stretch but it's
[09:54] starting to become a little bit more of
[09:56] the normal vocabulary and I think people
[09:59] are wising up to the fact that there is
[10:01] a money printer um and this sustained
[10:04] lot of inflation that everyone's been
[10:06] feeling like the reports are inflation's
[10:08] coming down inflation's coming down and
[10:10] they paint that as a good picture but
[10:12] it's still an increase in in uh in in
[10:17] the purchase uh or in the cost of goods
[10:19] and services just at a reduced rate and
[10:21] I think people are really starting to
[10:23] starting to question at least in my sort
[10:25] of circles um in and around the the
[10:28] industry that I work in uh I mean we're
[10:31] probably pretty lucky in the in the
[10:32] sense that we're quite affluent uh the
[10:35] the sort of Industry I work in is quite
[10:38] High wages so maybe um maybe I'm in a
[10:41] bit of an echo chamber in terms of
[10:42] people who have probably a bit more to
[10:44] spend in and look at investing and
[10:46] probably a bit more clued into finance
[10:47] and and investing so I'm very aware of
[10:50] that fact but I do I am encouraged by
[10:52] the fact that even beyond that and other
[10:54] conversations outside of that sort of
[10:56] immediate work Circle I think I think
[10:59] the language is starting to shift I I do
[11:01] actually think that it's becoming a
[11:03] little bit more common place somebody
[11:05] people just know fundamentally they know
[11:07] when they going to the grocery store and
[11:09] they going to the fuel Bowser they know
[11:11] that they're not getting as much for
[11:13] their dollar as they once did yeah it's
[11:16] the inflation is the thing it's also
[11:19] interesting because once there's an exit
[11:21] we in a system uh we have the same thing
[11:24] with Twitter Facebook and Nostra uh I
[11:27] feel like since Nostra is around and
[11:29] Twitter and Facebook uh are aware of
[11:32] those things uh and even Facebook is
[11:35] aware of of what Twitter is doing and
[11:37] Twitter is do aware of what nosto is
[11:39] doing you have an exit W if they are
[11:41] censoring too much you you have a place
[11:44] where they can all a sudden go if
[11:46] there's only Facebook uh mark would
[11:50] would have never done anything in that R
[11:52] but because there's Twitter where
[11:54] there's more freedom of speech uh people
[11:56] can go there and the same from Twitter
[11:58] there's still still censorship and
[12:00] there's still uh controls in there if
[12:02] you want to go further you can go to
[12:04] Nostra and I feel like the same is true
[12:07] for fear currency if you are having the
[12:09] Turkish L you're like oh let's go to the
[12:12] US dollar because that's so much better
[12:14] if you're in the US dollar and it goes
[12:16] worse and worse and worse you can just
[12:17] go into Bitcoin uh and and and and that
[12:21] kind of control that kind of exit wealth
[12:25] of of people can flee there makes
[12:27] actually the other thing I think better
[12:30] because now the Federal Reserve now the
[12:32] other ones they cannot do crazy money
[12:35] printing because there is now a
[12:38] scoreboard of how bad they are actually
[12:40] doing if the Federal Reserve does the
[12:42] same thing now that it did in 2020 in Co
[12:46] this will be 5x or 10x worse than in
[12:50] 2020 Bitcoin will be at like 1.4 million
[12:54] in like no time if they uh print again
[12:57] like 50% of the money supply
[12:59] uh so with that in mind uh you're
[13:03] totally right and I see that the same
[13:05] same exact way of like inflation is the
[13:07] one thing that everyone noticed you
[13:09] cannot hide higher prices like you can
[13:12] you can if the if the inflation is like
[13:14] two 3% you can spin it around and say
[13:16] like oh yeah we need inflation to like
[13:18] stuff like that but if it's like 10 20%
[13:21] and consistently and going up like
[13:23] people are not dumb they they they they
[13:25] know what's going
[13:27] on you can only spin uh so much I really
[13:31] like that thing of like there's an exit
[13:33] valve all of the S there and it makes
[13:35] inflation U more seeable and more
[13:38] feelable for for the people that's how I
[13:41] I look at it yeah I think it's a really
[13:43] good analogy around uh the the social
[13:45] media aspect and comparing that to the
[13:47] different currencies I think it's a
[13:49] really good really good analogy and I
[13:50] think I think the other um entry
[13:53] mechanism for people particularly in
[13:54] Australia is is real estate like
[13:56] particularly for young people who who
[13:58] probably get the digital the digital
[14:00] currency thesis quicker than the Boomers
[14:02] necessarily but um in Australia you just
[14:04] cannot buy property uh if you're in your
[14:07] 20s you will not be able to save for a
[14:10] deposit particular if you're in one of
[14:11] these Capital Cities like um Sydney
[14:14] where little units in the Sydney CBD are
[14:18] selling for millions of dollars um and
[14:20] then you go out to the outer suburbs and
[14:21] little butter box two-bedroom houses are
[14:24] selling for millions of dollars you
[14:25] cannot save on a normal retail or
[14:29] Hospitality wage you cannot save a
[14:30] deposit to get into that market let
[14:32] alone service your debt without you know
[14:35] having 14 people living in a two-bedroom
[14:37] apartment so I think that's the other
[14:39] entry mechanism by which you know we can
[14:42] start to um draw that contrast between
[14:46] your type of money so for anybody
[14:48] denominating real estate in fiat
[14:51] currency it's forever growing for anyone
[14:54] who just changes their frame and thinks
[14:56] about money in a different way and just
[14:58] chooses a different form of of money one
[14:59] that's not forever printed out there one
[15:02] that's not continuously losing its
[15:04] purchasing power one that is a finite
[15:06] Supply one that will increase in
[15:07] purchasing power you denominate real
[15:09] estate and Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only
[15:12] currency globally where real estate's
[15:14] going down and I have to show you
[15:16] something if I can if I can do that let
[15:18] me see there and that's what I also love
[15:21] that website you probably aware of the
[15:23] website like price in Bitcoin I don't
[15:25] know if you know it but show show
[15:28] sometimes
[15:29] and seeing that of like yeah we Young
[15:33] Generation cannot afford uh a housing
[15:35] because it gets more more expensive but
[15:38] if you actually like adopt the Bitcoin
[15:40] standard uh housing will be affordable
[15:43] for you again like if you have a Bitcoin
[15:45] standard for like 5 10 15 20 years all
[15:48] of the sudden you can maybe buy with a
[15:50] small uh part of your stack a house we
[15:54] your family lives in it and I noticed
[15:57] that a lot of Bitcoin actually want to
[15:59] own a house they want to own the thing
[16:01] that their family is in it's like it's
[16:03] it's really important for them uh and
[16:05] that story is really powerful and see
[16:08] just seeing that growth of like real
[16:11] estate is going
[16:12] up quite fast actually like for an asset
[16:16] that is getting worse over time like
[16:18] everyone that owns a house knows a house
[16:22] after 10 years is so much worse in the
[16:25] condition than in the starting you have
[16:27] to do so many repairs like it's it's
[16:28] it's a constant work you have to do with
[16:30] a house I grew up in a house since like
[16:32] I was 2 years old and I just saw my
[16:35] parents uh all the time working on the
[16:37] house either there's a new project that
[16:39] you want to change something or there's
[16:41] something old broken all the time things
[16:44] are happening in a house and then having
[16:46] an asset that you don't have to do
[16:48] anything except keep it safe which yeah
[16:51] you figure one time out and you maybe
[16:53] want to trick it around like every year
[16:55] and make sure everything is perfect uh
[16:58] and that's so Superior uh and then you
[17:01] can maybe afford a house with that like
[17:02] that that's that's an amazing thing
[17:04] especially for the Young Generation I'm
[17:06] like 26 now and uh owning a a home
[17:10] without Bitcoin wouldn't even be in my
[17:12] vocabulary and thanks to bitcoin I'm
[17:14] like okay I can see how I might be able
[17:17] to afford a home maybe in when I'm 30 or
[17:19] 35 that's that's kind of the the hope
[17:21] that Bitcoin gives you and often do do
[17:24] do you also own on real estate or how do
[17:26] you see it with with real estate yeah
[17:27] I've just got uh I don't know investment
[17:29] properties any anymore well I can't
[17:31] actually say that cuz we just moved out
[17:32] of our house and um we're renting it out
[17:34] so we're just about to hit the road in
[17:36] the Caravan with the kids we've pulled
[17:38] them out of school for the year and
[17:40] we're going to tour Australia for 12
[17:41] months in the in the Caravan so I do
[17:43] have a a home my
[17:46] wife likes the security of having a home
[17:48] and I guess it it comes back to maso's
[17:50] hierarchy needs and a lot of your
[17:52] listeners are probably familiar with
[17:53] that but food and shelter are one of the
[17:55] base layers of human human need human
[17:59] endeavor and it's when you secure with
[18:01] those you can start to um you know you
[18:04] can start to um look look towards
[18:07] self-actualization uh you clim climbing
[18:09] that climbing that ladder um my wife
[18:11] loves loves the family home she loves
[18:13] having the security of having a roof
[18:15] overhead and a place to call home um but
[18:19] I see very much like yourself and like
[18:21] you've just highlighted um houses are
[18:23] massive liabilities and in Australia we
[18:26] don't have a very big or evolved stock
[18:30] market and it's not cultural like
[18:33] sometimes I observe in the US perhaps in
[18:36] and around investing in the stock market
[18:38] so a lot of Aussie Battlers Aussie wage
[18:41] earners to get ahead they know
[18:44] subconsciously that the money's broke
[18:46] and they know they can't save in dollars
[18:47] so they're always looking towards
[18:48] property you talk to any Aussie um who's
[18:52] looking to get ahead their number one
[18:54] goal is to get an investment property
[18:56] and they are massive liability so the
[18:59] the house we were just in we built that
[19:01] ourselves um in 2010 what are we 14 15
[19:05] years on now and it's just starting to
[19:07] fall apart uh I had to spend so much
[19:10] money just getting it rent ready for
[19:12] tenants to move into it um while we're
[19:13] taking this 12 month Hiatus um because
[19:16] we wanted to rent it out and obviously
[19:17] get that income turn that into Bitcoin
[19:19] while we're on the road and Bob's your
[19:21] uncle um but yeah it's was everywhere I
[19:24] turned just needed more maintenance more
[19:25] maintenance and more maintenance what
[19:27] did motivate you to take that trip of
[19:30] like 12 months tour uh around Australia
[19:33] and and leave the the home behind for
[19:36] like a
[19:37] year um yeah it was a multiple of things
[19:39] but obviously hanging around Bitcoin is
[19:41] it's pretty infectious um read Daniel
[19:43] Prince's book um chose life that's an
[19:46] amazing book if anyone hasn't read it
[19:48] he's a prolific bitcoiner who's been
[19:50] doing that living his best life with his
[19:52] family spending a lot of time together
[19:54] as a family unit my boys are getting the
[19:58] uh at cool age where they'll remember it
[20:00] you know so they're eight and 11 um and
[20:03] I missed a lot of the early years I was
[20:05] hustling working the F slave mine um
[20:08] spent a lot of time away from home
[20:09] trying to provide for the family and we
[20:12] just decided that um we needed a a bit
[20:15] of a break with the family and it's
[20:17] ultimately being through Bitcoin um
[20:20] Bitcoin has enabled me and given me a
[20:22] lot more optionality to choose how I
[20:24] direct my time and that's simply through
[20:27] understanding and hodling
[20:29] and um it's allowed us to sit back and
[20:31] then reassess what's important to us and
[20:34] at the moment it's not earning fat money
[20:36] anymore it's now how do we maximize the
[20:39] time with the children while they're
[20:40] young while they still want to know us
[20:42] before they turn into teenagers and
[20:44] don't want to know their dad anymore um
[20:46] and so we decided to pull them out of
[20:48] school and homeschool them we're going
[20:50] to travel school on the road and um we
[20:52] got a beautiful country we're pretty
[20:54] lucky that we live in Australia um it's
[20:57] a lot parts of it it's a big country
[20:59] where I haven't seen most of it um you
[21:01] know I've seen Queensland a lot that's
[21:03] where the state that I live in but there
[21:05] it's a you know out of the seven states
[21:07] I haven't traveled um very far out of
[21:09] them so it was just a great opportunity
[21:11] to spend a bit more time with family and
[21:14] um it's really you know for 2025 for us
[21:16] it's about family connection that's
[21:18] that's really what we wanted to focus on
[21:19] is just um getting back to to some
[21:22] Grassroots and spend time as much time
[21:25] with the kids and while these formative
[21:27] years you know that's amazing because
[21:28] that's it it kind of shows uh this this
[21:32] Bitcoin life where you you don't stack
[21:34] Bitcoin to have more Bitcoin you stack
[21:38] Bitcoin to get more life like that's the
[21:40] ultimate goal and I love that you're
[21:43] that journey and that's that's amazing I
[21:45] I had it with Daniel Prince just like
[21:48] five six days ago podcast episode or
[21:51] something like that uh and he actually
[21:53] uh talked about choose at live in the
[21:55] end of the podcast and he mentioned that
[21:57] someone I don't know if it was you but
[22:00] someone came up to him and said like oh
[22:02] like I hate your book because now I'm I
[22:05] have to to to do that finally now
[22:09] there's no more excuses that that I
[22:11] don't uh travel travel the world or
[22:13] something like that uh was that by CH
[22:16] you it could it could possibly have been
[22:19] me I know priny quite well so it could
[22:21] have been me saying tongue and cheek cuz
[22:23] I I've I've um I read that book oh would
[22:27] have been a good 3 years ago it was it
[22:29] was once I read it it was just an itch
[22:31] that needed to be scratched and it just
[22:33] kept kept going kept going and I mean
[22:35] this this is probably been about a year
[22:37] in in planning and making we sort of
[22:39] made the decision that we were going to
[22:40] do it and took a year to sort of get our
[22:43] ducks Aline in a row and make sure
[22:46] everything was was sort of organized and
[22:49] um we're leaving we're currently living
[22:51] on the front lawn in the Caravan at my
[22:53] mother-in-law's place on her front lawn
[22:55] and um we'll be we'll be leaving in uh
[22:58] two weeks on first of f
[23:00] so did you uh also V all in Bitcoin or
[23:04] did you like slowly get get in there in
[23:08] in the following years how how did you
[23:10] do that what's say right when I
[23:11] discovered Bitcoin did I go all in ah
[23:14] yes I'm really curious on how quick
[23:17] people getting orange build because
[23:19] right now I see like people getting
[23:21] really quickly orange build like people
[23:22] that come in4 they are like uh five six
[23:26] months in and they're already like
[23:28] further down the rabbit hole than I was
[23:29] after like two years so it's like it
[23:32] seems to be a very uh fasten process and
[23:35] so like I'm curious how how long it t
[23:37] took you to like adopt this Bitcoin
[23:39] standard mindset and and and I don't
[23:42] know go all in depending on what does go
[23:45] all in even mean yeah yeah now it's a
[23:48] it's a really good question and I agree
[23:49] with you I think that's accelerating and
[23:51] I think that's only due to the the great
[23:53] work every you know bitcoiners have put
[23:56] in so the the class of 2014 helped shape
[24:00] the class of 2017 the class of 2017
[24:02] helped shape the class of 2020 and it's
[24:04] just we're getting more materials the
[24:06] messaging is getting more succinct and
[24:10] there's just a lot more avenues for you
[24:12] to get exposure to the to to that
[24:14] messaging and to get that conviction
[24:15] like I spoke about a little bit earlier
[24:17] and um for so for me personally it was
[24:18] pretty well pretty it was pretty quick
[24:21] um I'd say pretty well all in within a
[24:24] year uh so
[24:26] 2019 discovering the why the message
[24:29] 2020 till I sort of really heard the
[24:31] message bought my first Bitcoin not till
[24:34] 2020 then tried to break it right so as
[24:38] I was learning as I was buying absorbed
[24:40] a lot of information um I'm a I love
[24:43] reading and um worked out a few hacks to
[24:46] sort of speed read and get absorb
[24:49] information really quickly over time
[24:50] which I'm happy to talk about actually
[24:51] if that's of interest but um uh I'd say
[24:55] by the end of that 2020 I'd started my
[24:57] own self man super fund which is our
[24:59] retirement accounts in Australia got
[25:01] exposure to Bitcoin in there as well uh
[25:04] and from from from 2020 end of 2020 was
[25:07] really it didn't take very long at all
[25:09] um and large exposure and I mean I don't
[25:12] manage risk in the way that I was 100%
[25:15] ever um and I'm still not 100% but it is
[25:19] now very very high percentage of that
[25:22] and the Fiat exposure um is getting
[25:25] smaller and smaller by the day and
[25:27] that's just purely
[25:29] most of that's driven by um by the the
[25:32] virtue of of just the tenure of of
[25:34] having exposure to it over time like
[25:37] obviously it's just growing and growing
[25:38] and growing and the fear exposure hasn't
[25:40] been added to and it's just growing at a
[25:42] smaller rate and it just gets absorbed
[25:43] by the bigger peace and when I guess the
[25:45] important part and I get often get asked
[25:47] this by friends and family who obviously
[25:51] you know you talk to about not not
[25:53] specific figures but they can see that
[25:55] bitcoin's now playing a larger part in
[25:56] your life and it it's opened up a lot
[25:59] more Avenues and provided for your
[26:01] family and created abundance where on
[26:04] steroids basically where that wouldn't
[26:06] have been able to happen before and
[26:07] quite often I get asked and you're going
[26:09] to take some off the table and it's kind
[26:10] of that that argument before around have
[26:12] you made any money well it is the money
[26:14] so I just want more of the money right
[26:16] um Bitcoin is the money so I want more
[26:18] of the Bitcoin but uh in all seriousness
[26:20] when you look and you read any major
[26:22] investment book or any major investment
[26:25] advice that you that you know um
[26:28] peripheries um or peripherals rather
[26:30] that have come through in the in the
[26:32] last couple of decades and most of them
[26:34] say
[26:36] diversification if you've sitting on big
[26:38] gains roll some out Tak some off the
[26:40] table and diversify your your assets uh
[26:43] into other things when you've made
[26:45] significant wealth and gains and when I
[26:47] do that with Bitcoin I think about doing
[26:49] that with Bitcoin I look around the
[26:51] investment landscape There is seriously
[26:52] nothing else I want to buy when you
[26:54] actually understand how to value stocks
[26:57] for example you understand how to do a
[26:59] discount cash from a stock and do a
[27:01] valuation on what a stock is actually
[27:02] worth you realize that everything real
[27:06] estate
[27:07] stocks equities private Equity all
[27:10] trading upon at multiples upon what
[27:13] would otherwise be considered fair value
[27:15] so when I look around the investment
[27:17] landscape and know if I was going to
[27:18] sell Bitcoin all I would want to do is
[27:20] buy more Bitcoin now it's kind of
[27:22] Testament to when I get more Fiat right
[27:24] now at any stage I look around I go r
[27:28] what am I going to do with this Fiat
[27:29] obviously you know satisfy your
[27:31] immediate needs your food your shelter
[27:33] your bills all that sort of stuff and
[27:34] the leftover where do I want to park
[27:37] this where is going to um perform best
[27:39] where is it going to protect my
[27:40] purchasing Barrel or or improve my my um
[27:44] my asset portfolio and it's Bitcoin
[27:46] every single time so you know if I'm
[27:48] going to diversify at this stage of the
[27:50] game all I'm going to want to do is get
[27:52] exposure on more Bitcoin are you playing
[27:54] any fear games in terms of getting a
[27:57] loan against your house or something
[27:59] like that no it's definitely something
[28:02] I'm keeping a breast off um that might
[28:05] may be something um oh sorry I should I
[28:08] should say I did actually tap into some
[28:10] into some equity on my um on my mortgage
[28:13] um and it comes in opportunity cost
[28:15] right so I I do have a a mortgage you
[28:17] know um again quite often friends and
[28:21] family say well why would you use some
[28:22] of your Bitcoin to pay off your mortgage
[28:24] and live mortgage free and it comes down
[28:26] opportunity cost I can get that mortgage
[28:27] I fixed that mortgage rate at something
[28:29] ridiculous like
[28:30] 2.6% for the next 6 years so
[28:35] while my uh my propensity my my ability
[28:39] to shift the
[28:41] needle with my own um appreciating my
[28:44] returns that I if I put that Capital to
[28:46] work I am damn sure that I can perform
[28:49] better than the 2.6% and it all comes
[28:52] down to that well they call that
[28:54] opportunity cost so I could be servicing
[28:55] that debt down and and saving myself
[28:58] 2.6% or I could put that Capital to work
[29:00] in a performing asset like Bitcoin
[29:02] that's um you know experiencing a
[29:03] compound annual growth rate of 40% year
[29:05] onye give or take so it' be Madness of
[29:10] me knowing the Bitcoin thesis not to and
[29:13] I did tap into some some equity and
[29:15] again I don't manage I don't overexpose
[29:17] myself into into leverage but we had
[29:19] quite a significant amount of equity
[29:20] sitting in the home loan um and um
[29:23] knowing we're going to hit the road this
[29:25] year I i' you know I'm a big um advocate
[29:28] for dollar cost averaging so for any
[29:30] wage earner who wants to get exposure to
[29:32] bitcoin the best honest way that you
[29:34] could do that is to dollar cost average
[29:35] put a little bit of your wager side each
[29:38] day or each week whatever that means for
[29:40] you something that you're not going to
[29:42] need in the next four years it's not
[29:44] stuff that you're going to want to pay
[29:45] the bills with next week put it aside
[29:47] stack Bitcoin come back at a late later
[29:49] date knowing that I was going to hit the
[29:51] road and probably and not earn as much
[29:53] Bitcoin anymore I was sort of looking
[29:55] around my options and said well what
[29:57] could I do
[29:58] for me to counteract if I know I'm not
[30:01] going to dollar cost average anymore how
[30:02] can I bring some of that dollar cost
[30:04] average
[30:06] forward if I'm going to be missing it
[30:08] out for the next year and I'm looking at
[30:09] this equity in this home that's you know
[30:11] doing nothing and the interest rates are
[30:13] still quite low in comparison to what I
[30:16] think Bitcoin can do so we tapped into a
[30:18] little bit of that and um turned it into
[30:20] Bitcoin so playing the fit game playing
[30:22] the speculative F game around do I think
[30:24] whatever my my cost to carry and service
[30:27] alone against my
[30:29] mortgage without overexposing yourself
[30:32] in in a way that's going to get you in
[30:33] trouble if Bitcoin were to dip um yeah
[30:36] you know in my humble opinion I'd be mad
[30:39] not to yeah I think the the question
[30:40] that everyone has to ask themselves if
[30:43] if you do that playing that Fe game
[30:46] would you still be okay if uh a good
[30:50] amount of your income might break away
[30:53] and over the next two years or three
[30:55] years we are having like an 80% draw
[30:58] down in Bitcoin would you still be fine
[31:01] with that obviously the income is a hard
[31:03] part of that um and it's also depends on
[31:06] like what kind of thing thing you have
[31:09] like do you need to service the dep with
[31:11] like a huge amount every month and do
[31:14] you have big troubles when all of a
[31:16] sudden your income breaks away for like
[31:18] a few months can happen to everyone uh
[31:21] so like those questions uh everyone has
[31:23] to ask themselves I tried it uh and
[31:26] still have something running um but I'm
[31:29] currently working to reverse all of that
[31:31] uh and it's so small I could um with
[31:35] with my Bitcoin stack I could easily pay
[31:37] it off really easily it wouldn't make a
[31:40] huge Dam on the Bitcoin stack that's why
[31:41] I just keep it I was like oh it's easy
[31:45] but um I honestly I'm just not the
[31:48] person for that like I would just like
[31:50] to have my Bitcoin stack and pay from
[31:54] that I also I also this is an
[31:56] interesting topic and it's very contr
[31:57] commcial I actually would like to pay
[32:00] everything with my Bitcoin uh directly
[32:02] because then I don't have to have fear
[32:05] everyone says like oh use Fiat to pay
[32:08] and huddle your Bitcoin but if I pay
[32:11] with my
[32:13] Fiat I have to hold feat
[32:16] also or I have credit and I'm I'm not a
[32:20] big credit guy so I want to avoid that I
[32:22] I have credit right now but I I want to
[32:25] put that away over over the the next
[32:28] years so that that's an interesting
[32:30] topic where I'm like okay I actually
[32:32] want to be as much on a Bitcoin standard
[32:35] as possible and yeah spend my Bitcoin
[32:37] like there that's money like I want to
[32:40] use that money I know using feed would
[32:44] be better but I don't want I don't even
[32:46] want to touch Fiat I don't want to do
[32:48] anything with Fiat and I earn Bitcoin so
[32:51] uh in the long run anyways I have to at
[32:53] some point sell Bitcoin because I don't
[32:56] have my my fear income stream gets
[32:58] smaller and my Bitcoin income stream
[33:00] gets bigger so at some point I I run in
[33:02] that uh thing anyways but it's really
[33:04] interesting also what you said about
[33:05] wage earners that they sh that that once
[33:09] they just get to a Bitcoin standard they
[33:11] don't have to be day Traders anymore and
[33:15] look at Q2 uh Q
[33:19] Q10 and and those earning reports of of
[33:22] stocks and then those earning calls and
[33:24] stuff like that that's a huge inside
[33:27] yeah
[33:28] yeah and I think
[33:30] um I think this cycle too just it uh I
[33:34] think this is kind of related to to the
[33:36] topic we've been talking about um with
[33:38] the fat games and tapping into um the
[33:43] the appreciation in your purchasing
[33:45] power by holding Bitcoin this cycle is
[33:49] where we really see institutional great
[33:52] offerings for borrowing against your
[33:53] Bitcoin so we we have it in just about
[33:55] every other asset and there are some you
[33:57] know Leen and hoddle hodle are some
[33:59] services that you can do this and
[34:00] essentially what I'm speaking what I'm
[34:02] talking about is borrowing against your
[34:04] Bitcoin so you know we've got quite
[34:07] wellestablished products for Real Estate
[34:10] got quite well established products for
[34:12] um uh for equities to borrow
[34:16] against if you have a big bag of of
[34:18] stocks Amazon stock you can borrow
[34:20] against that and use that to fund your
[34:22] lifestyle and I think and and there's
[34:24] always dangers with this and that's
[34:25] probably something to really highlight
[34:26] from the get-go is
[34:28] be very careful when when it comes to
[34:31] these offerings because they they will
[34:32] pop up we had a few blow up in the last
[34:34] cycle I'm not advocating at all for
[34:37] staking your Bitcoin to earn a yield
[34:39] that's not what I'm talking about but
[34:40] there will be institutional grade
[34:42] offerings to be able to say enter into a
[34:44] two or three multisig with a platform A
[34:48] lender and a borrower where you stake an
[34:50] over collateralized loan you take say a
[34:53] million dollars worth of bitcoin to
[34:54] borrow $500,000 to fund your lifestyle
[34:57] um they will I already know of a few um
[35:01] you know pretty prominent bitcoiners in
[35:02] the space that shall remain nameless at
[35:05] this stage but working on those types of
[35:07] offerings um and that is a way that
[35:10] bitcoiners can start to tap into and use
[35:14] the Bitcoin appreciation the the
[35:16] purchasing PA of the appreciation of
[35:18] their their Bitcoin to to start funding
[35:19] their livestocks to start you know
[35:22] providing for their families or choosing
[35:24] to perhaps go into real estate without
[35:27] selling you coin um and that's only
[35:30] become going to become more and more
[35:32] prolific I think over this next couple
[35:34] of Cycles um if not this one at least
[35:37] the next two and we will see
[35:39] institutional grade in terms of the big
[35:41] Banks they will want to huddle your
[35:42] Bitcoin and they will
[35:44] probably give you a fairly decent
[35:46] interest rate for the for the for the
[35:48] service of it I'm not advocating that
[35:49] you necessarily need to do that but
[35:51] those services will pop up and then you
[35:53] make a judgment call for your for your
[35:55] own self around if I take a small
[35:58] portion of my stack that I can start
[36:00] tapping into some of the equity some of
[36:02] the purchasing power of that is that a
[36:05] bad thing and no I don't think it is and
[36:07] it also potentially depending on your
[36:09] jurisdiction wherever you live can
[36:11] actually give you tax advantage ways of
[36:13] doing it um in most jurisdictions that's
[36:15] not a capital gain of it to borrow
[36:16] against your Bitcoin to fund your
[36:18] lifestyle you don't have to realize
[36:19] you're not disposing of the Bitcoin
[36:21] You're simply parking it and tapping
[36:22] into it very much like with with
[36:24] property right now property muls have
[36:25] been doing this for years they will buy
[36:28] a portfolio of properties and then they
[36:30] start one year they'll tap into the
[36:32] equity of one property and they'll
[36:34] service the loans for the others as well
[36:36] as fund their lifestyle then the second
[36:38] year they'll go to the second property
[36:39] and they'll borrow against the um the
[36:41] equity in that that the the appreciation
[36:43] of the capital that that um property is
[36:46] worth they'll tap into that and they'll
[36:48] again borrow against that to fund the
[36:51] own repayments of all of the others as
[36:53] well as fund their Lifestyles and that's
[36:55] how you can tap into the appreciation of
[36:59] an asset um and it's only a matter of
[37:01] time before that is um is available in
[37:04] abundance with Bitcoin because it's a
[37:05] pristine it's one of the most pristine
[37:07] assets we've ever had I partnered up
[37:09] with coin vigilante this is the most

[39:21] I think that's a uh it's an amazing
[39:23] insight to have it's also you said
[39:25] before with like this two one 2 3 or 6%
[39:30] what what you're paying on on the
[39:32] mortgage it's like yeah like Bitcoin is
[39:35] it's it will be really hard to not see
[39:38] an on average and 30% uh almost
[39:41] risk-free return there's nothing risk-
[39:44] free there risk associated with that but
[39:46] it's like uh the closest thing that we
[39:49] have to a 30% risk-free return over the
[39:52] next 5 10 years and probably way higher
[39:54] I I don't I don't believe diminishing
[39:56] returns that all I think they are kind
[39:59] of BS and I think we will have a huge
[40:02] adoption wave and a huge uh cycle uh
[40:05] breaking of of that kind of a thing but
[40:08] it's it's the it's the it's the thing
[40:10] you you save your money in it's it's
[40:12] it's the the best money ever and and I
[40:14] love your story with that yeah really
[40:16] cool well and you've h a really good
[40:18] point too just to Circle all this back
[40:20] to other Equity uh all other assets
[40:22] right and when you look around I said
[40:23] before like everything's so grossly
[40:25] overvalued because everything's
[40:26] attracted at a monetary premium and when
[40:29] you fix the money the monetary premium
[40:31] no longer needs to exist in these other
[40:33] assets so that's one aspect but then
[40:35] also as people start to realize what
[40:37] Bitcoin is and bitcoin's put um you know
[40:41] performance over the last decade and
[40:42] like you say I'm I'm a I'm I'm a big
[40:44] believer of that too diminishing returns
[40:46] no I don't think we're going to see that
[40:47] I think we're going to just continue to
[40:49] see an acceleration of adoption as
[40:51] people start to look around look at
[40:54] Bitcoin look at what it starts to doing
[40:57] to their friends and family and an Ever
[40:59] growing community of people who are
[41:01] starting to feather their nest and
[41:03] really start to tap into um the
[41:05] optionality that bitcoin's provided it's
[41:07] only going to put fuel on that fire of
[41:09] adoption and then the hurdle rate people
[41:12] are then going to start looking around
[41:14] at all these other assets that they own
[41:16] and they say well if you're not
[41:18] performing if Mr Equity Mr Amazon stock
[41:21] Mr Apple stock if you're not giving me a
[41:23] 30% return why the hell do I own you so
[41:26] we're going to actually see a major
[41:28] correction and all that monetary premium
[41:31] gets sucked out of these other assets
[41:33] and they will actually return back to
[41:34] fair value and I think Preston pitch
[41:36] speaks about this quite often um he's
[41:38] obviously a great mind in the space he
[41:40] and and something that was somebody who
[41:42] was definitely formative in my journey
[41:45] in understanding Bitcoin and he speaks
[41:47] about this all the time in and around
[41:49] there will be a time when I'll probably
[41:51] look at uplighting some Bitcoin when
[41:54] that evens out in terms of getting
[41:58] uh when when other assets start to get
[42:00] back to their fair value and it starts
[42:02] to become attractive again to somebody
[42:04] to say you know like we spoke about
[42:06] before some people at some stage in
[42:08] their life may like to have a roof over
[42:10] their head and then it comes down to
[42:12] that opportunity C in around well what
[42:14] are you actually selling me bricks and
[42:16] morar what is that worth and what is
[42:17] that worth in Bitcoin terms and at some
[42:19] point in time that will shift and now I
[42:22] value the house more than I value that
[42:24] amount of Bitcoin so of course they're
[42:26] going to you you know use any means
[42:28] necessary to to go and acquire that
[42:31] whether that's selling their Bitcoin or
[42:32] tapping into some of these products that
[42:34] we've been speaking about to try and um
[42:37] tap into that in tax efficient
[42:39] ways that's an super interesting one
[42:42] it's it's it's kind of increasing the
[42:44] hurdle rate for investing if we have a
[42:48] feat standard of a US dollar your hurdle
[42:51] rate
[42:52] is minus five- 10us 20% it's like want
[42:57] to get rid of it but if you have Bitcoin
[43:00] currently the hurdle rate is yeah plus
[43:02] 30 plus 40 plus 50% a year whatever you
[43:05] take and yes we have now a huge adoption
[43:09] uh so it Bitcoin will also not increase
[43:12] in purchasing power that quickly in the
[43:14] future uh it will probably like uh slow
[43:17] down at some point if uh in like I don't
[43:20] know in 20 30 40 years but you will
[43:22] still have a positive purchasing power
[43:25] and just that increase of like like you
[43:27] don't have like 10 20% minus hurdle rate
[43:30] you have like a I don't know three five
[43:33] maybe like 10% plus of a hurdle rate
[43:35] each year that completely changes how
[43:38] you look at investing because all of the
[43:39] sudden just keeping your money will
[43:41] increase your purchasing power which
[43:43] means you need less money every year
[43:45] which means if you have a big enough
[43:47] stack you live forever with that stack
[43:50] you don't have to risk anything you
[43:53] don't have to oh like see like is it now
[43:55] Tesla the future or like some some
[43:58] Chinese manufacturer the future where
[44:01] where is uh where are we going with
[44:03] space travel what is the best AI play
[44:06] this is fun topics if you're interested
[44:08] in it and I love those topics and I will
[44:10] get back to that and probably even like
[44:12] talk on on my channel in some point in
[44:15] like five 10 years around it because
[44:16] it's really fun but if you're just um I
[44:20] don't know a doctor and want to save
[44:21] lives on a day you don't want to come
[44:23] home and see if if now Microsoft because
[44:26] of open my eyes has a better chance at
[44:28] being the biggest stock uh in the future
[44:31] versus uh some other smaller AI company
[44:34] and dig really deep uh like that's not
[44:37] your job like your job is being a great
[44:40] doctor and that's probably you have
[44:42] chosen that rout you probably are
[44:44] passionate about being that and saving
[44:46] people's life and helping people so you
[44:48] should not do that Investments you
[44:51] should spend time with your family
[44:53] you're 100% right most people have two
[44:56] jobs right one is was earning the money
[44:57] and then two was learning not to lose it
[45:01] um like me I was an electrician you know
[45:03] um with an engineering degree and I
[45:05] ended up spending all my nights reading
[45:08] Finance books spent two years reading
[45:11] every book I could get my hands on just
[45:13] to learn how to invest before I actually
[45:15] invested ultimately what led me to
[45:17] bitcoin but I shouldn't have to I should
[45:19] I'm an electrician I should just be able
[45:20] to go to my job do my job well provide
[45:25] more value than I than and so I so that
[45:28] I can retain value out of the money that
[45:30] I pay put that money to and put that
[45:32] money aside and it should should be able
[45:33] to come back at a ready date Bo need to
[45:35] make money like Grandma used to say it
[45:38] worked put it under the bed come back
[45:40] and buy yourself something pretty after
[45:41] you've saved it for a while that's what
[45:43] money should be not this forever
[45:46] eroding uh you know extractive um
[45:49] product that you know is it's slowly
[45:51] just robbing you of your time and energy
[45:53] like you know you're spending so much
[45:55] time away from your friends and family
[45:57] now both mom and dad are at work most
[46:00] people have to work overtime I certainly
[46:02] did spent years and years working as
[46:05] much overtime as I could just to simply
[46:07] try to get ahead put some money money
[46:09] aside you know and then quickly
[46:11] realizing that if I didn't actually put
[46:12] that money to work it wasn't going to do
[46:14] anything for me so I had to I was forced
[46:16] into having to read all these Finance
[46:19] books it wasn't it wasn't fun I didn't
[46:21] actually want to do it I just had to do
[46:23] it I just realized I was lucky in in a
[46:25] sense that I sort of woke up to the fact
[46:27] that if if I didn't do it I was going to
[46:29] be screwed so you know and now it's
[46:32] funny like um just talking to another
[46:34] Bitcoin or friend of of mine too and
[46:36] we've been in the space a little while
[46:37] now and we're starting to listen to L
[46:39] Bitcoin podcasts it's like well we we
[46:43] we've leared all there is to learn about
[46:45] Bitcoin itself I still find the
[46:46] conversations interesting and don't get
[46:48] me wrong I certainly haven't haven't
[46:50] stopped it but I'm not listening filling
[46:52] my day with Bitcoin podcast because
[46:55] that's where I got to at one point was
[46:56] just trying try to get as much
[46:57] information just to try and cement that
[47:00] conviction again and now I'm sitting
[47:02] back and going I can listen to them at
[47:04] leisure now I don't have to be doing the
[47:07] Deep download because I I understand it
[47:09] it's not doing it's not going anywhere
[47:12] and I don't even care about the
[47:13] short-term price um the fundamentals are
[47:16] always always s so I don't need to spend
[47:19] any more
[47:20] time learning any more about it and
[47:24] that's an amazing Insight because uh I
[47:27] consumed on a daily basis when I came
[47:29] into Bitcoin like two free podcasts like
[47:32] I was was crazy
[47:35] like yeah like two times speed like
[47:37] going I I always have like 1.75 two was
[47:40] too much for me it's like I I cannot do
[47:43] it I know most people do it and some
[47:45] people even want more than 2x I it's
[47:48] it's my my brain cannot comprehend but
[47:51] yeah like 1.75 or5 depends on the host
[47:54] some people are really fast talkers also
[47:56] uh some about really slow that it's like
[47:58] even too possible um but yeah like uh
[48:01] consuming that is amazing uh and and
[48:05] that that learning curve now I mean now
[48:08] my situation is a completely different
[48:09] one because I have a Bitcoin podcast
[48:13] production every day uh anyway so like I
[48:16] listen to a Bitcoin podcast just by that
[48:19] every day my own one um so I rarely
[48:22] listen to bitcoin podcasts now I I like
[48:25] once a week maybe that I'm like oh like
[48:28] there was a lot of buzz on on that one
[48:30] or oh there's an interesting clip that I
[48:32] saw oh like this looks really
[48:34] interesting I here and there look into a
[48:36] pitco podcast really rarely but my
[48:40] situation is is kind of unique because I
[48:43] do so many producing things in general I
[48:47] don't consume a lot like I really step
[48:51] down and and and don't consume a lot of
[48:53] content I because I'm so busy producing
[48:56] uh social media content so I kind of
[48:57] switched my role um but even if I
[49:00] wouldn't do that I probably would have
[49:02] scaled back my my producing and one
[49:05] thing that I hear and which is really
[49:06] interesting is people that work in the
[49:10] fat space they come to my podcast and
[49:13] they say like I already know about
[49:15] Bitcoin but I still love getting my
[49:18] daily Bitcoin fix uh after having like
[49:21] eight hour shifts at a Fiat world it's
[49:24] like like finally there are some some
[49:26] Bitcoin
[49:28] Escape where where I can get to like I
[49:30] hear that argument a lot and I can I can
[49:32] get it especially if you're in a if if
[49:34] you live in an environment where there's
[49:36] not a lot of bitcoiners or maybe no
[49:38] other Bitcoin around you uh it's kind of
[49:40] nice to to have the that that is Cap
[49:43] patch I don't know if you have a lot of
[49:44] Bitcoin as in in your personal
[49:46] environment and how your family also
[49:47] looks in it is an interesting topic uh
[49:50] but it's it's uh definitely a use case
[49:54] for that I saw which uh surprised me but
[49:58] it shouldn't have surprised me I think I
[50:00] think the commute always a good one you
[50:02] know cuz you you generally will commute
[50:04] on your own like I think in most
[50:06] situations I don't know if that's just a
[50:07] generalization or not but I think that's
[50:09] always uh I still you know this
[50:11] afternoon Ro Rod my bike home from work
[50:14] get some exercise in Bitcoin podcast I'm
[50:16] going to listen to anything it's going
[50:17] to be a Bitcoin podcast but I just tend
[50:19] to find the need to be that that um that
[50:23] that satiating the need to satiate that
[50:26] that uh the first um is is no longer
[50:30] there to be like constantly putting it
[50:32] in my ears um and I think the other
[50:34] thing I I was sort of reflecting on over
[50:35] Christmas which I thought was nice was
[50:37] um obviously I love reading and always
[50:40] love reading a lot and I love reading
[50:42] nonfiction I love learning I actually
[50:44] just sat down for the first time in a
[50:46] long time and just WR a fiction book for
[50:48] a while and I actually just really
[50:50] enjoyed just reading again you know for
[50:53] the love of reading instead of the the
[50:55] sort of um trying to do the the the
[50:58] massive Matrix download you know where
[51:00] you know he's sitting in the Neo sitting
[51:01] in the chair and they feed all this
[51:03] information wakes up goes I know Kung Fu
[51:06] like that's how I sort of treated
[51:08] learning these last couple of years just
[51:09] trying to absorb as many books as I
[51:11] could in and around this topic around
[51:14] macroeconomics inflation um Finance in
[51:17] general um you know Bitcoin obviously
[51:21] and uh now i' just been able to take my
[51:23] foot off that accelerator a little bit
[51:25] and just enjoy it and get back to the
[51:28] original love of reading which is I've
[51:29] always had I've been lucky to have that
[51:31] since I was a kid and just sat down over
[51:33] Christmas read a really big book and
[51:36] just went well that was really nice it
[51:38] is an
[51:39] interesting um because right now I'm in
[51:42] such a growth mode uh and I mean this
[51:45] has less to do now with with Bitcoin but
[51:47] I'm just like every time I I I'm trying
[51:50] to produce something or learn something
[51:53] um and my girlfriend kind of has to get
[51:56] me out of that mood and and every once
[51:57] in a while Al like just enjoying life
[52:00] and my only thing that I have regular is
[52:01] like swimming so I go four times a week
[52:04] swimming three times alone and one time
[52:06] with my girlfriend uh and it's amazing
[52:08] it's like just like like I'm just in the
[52:10] water I'm swimming uh one two three
[52:13] kilometers uh per session and I love it
[52:15] I don't even take my phone with me like
[52:17] I go out of the house to the pool and
[52:20] without phone it's an frightening
[52:22] feeling but once you get used to it it's
[52:24] really
[52:25] cool and it's funny you say that cuz my
[52:28] wife loves swimming and I don't mind
[52:30] swimming but when I was going through
[52:32] that really um hectic phase around
[52:34] trying to absorb I'd actually avoid
[52:36] swimming because I couldn't listen to
[52:37] all podcast while I swim I used to like
[52:39] exercising so I'd go to the gym and I'd
[52:41] get on bikes and I'd ride bikes and all
[52:43] that sort of thing because I knew I
[52:44] could always have headphones in my ears
[52:46] but actually would avoid swimming
[52:49] because I couldn't I didn't find out a
[52:51] good way to to to listen to podcast
[52:53] while I did it I think there's like some
[52:54] Bluetooth ones you can get these days um
[52:56] with a headband which is which is pretty
[52:58] cool but um it's funny you say that and
[53:01] I think like now I'd probably enjoy
[53:03] swimming again because it's just a
[53:05] really good excuse to disconnect right
[53:07] you're in your own thoughts and I think
[53:09] we don't spend enough time just in our
[53:12] own um thoughts reflecting on reflecting
[53:14] on your day reflecting on life in
[53:16] general and I think swimming is a really
[53:18] good way to just force that disconnect
[53:20] absolutely I just I just wanted to find
[53:22] that but I I was uh there's apparently
[53:25] uh uh none of the pictures online
[53:29] unfortunately uh I maybe I find one no I
[53:33] I I I don't but because I was on
[53:35] Austrian national level actually a swm
[53:38] really for Austrian standard really
[53:41] successful yeah and and I loved it and
[53:44] now I'm trying to learn my my girlfriend
[53:46] swimming U but yeah like unfortunately
[53:49] you don't find pictures at least I don't
[53:51] find pictures because all the Bitcoin
[53:53] pictures come before that if you Google
[53:56] me maybe I'll maybe I'll find uh one uh
[54:00] and show it somehow in the podcast one
[54:02] day uh but yeah like swimming is a big
[54:05] passion of mine that I kind of lost the
[54:06] last few years and now it comes back and
[54:09] I really do enjoy it it's just like that
[54:11] moment where it dve like I don't even
[54:13] want to have headphones I just want to
[54:15] sewn out and underw you hear a little
[54:18] less uh and then it's it's it's an
[54:20] amazing feeling so I I get uh um I get
[54:24] why your wife likes it it's it's an
[54:26] amazing feeling once you really get into
[54:27] it I also like running a lot for the
[54:29] same reason I'm not that good in running
[54:31] that's why I prefer swimming but running
[54:33] is the is the same thing for like the
[54:35] sports and it's like just like going on
[54:38] for like an hour and running not fast
[54:41] just like on a average Spa base and just
[54:44] like running somewhere it it has
[54:46] something amazing uh that that keeps you
[54:49] going and it's uh it's definitely a
[54:51] Bitcoin thing I feel like the sports
[54:53] thing yeah Magic
[54:56] really cool and one thing that I wanted
[54:58] to actually ask you like right in the
[54:59] beginning of the podcast is um do you
[55:02] see we have those re Evolutions in in
[55:05] Innovation we have we got electricity
[55:08] then we got the internet now we got uh
[55:11] Bitcoin with the money part do you see
[55:13] kind of Bitcoin now as the electricity
[55:17] that we uh from our generation is it
[55:21] that fundamental to to our life or is
[55:24] maybe electricity even even further uh
[55:28] was was it even more fundamental to our
[55:30] Liv like what what what is kind of the
[55:32] the scale of how big of a Evolution or
[55:36] revolution Bitcoin is and maybe you as
[55:39] an electrician maybe it's interesting to
[55:41] compare it to electricity which which
[55:44] was an very interesting technology that
[55:46] came us and also had some f along the
[55:49] way in in the beginning especially as we
[55:51] know yeah I think that's a really good
[55:53] question actually I I I honestly do see
[55:55] it as a step change in human Innovation
[55:57] um we haven't had a money like it and
[56:00] and when you study money when you study
[56:02] monetary history you understand all the
[56:04] properties of money and you realize that
[56:06] Bitcoin is the first one that solved all
[56:08] of those um issues really well um so you
[56:11] know gold gold was the closest gold was
[56:15] um available enough to be plentiful
[56:17] enough to be useful uh it was you know
[56:20] durable enough not to erode corrode
[56:23] react with other metals it was portable
[56:25] enough that could retain value it was
[56:27] divisible enough at the time um but you
[56:30] know when you when you fast forward
[56:32] where where did gold fail gold fail in
[56:35] its transport
[56:37] transportability um as the globe opened
[56:40] up and as global trade opened up um and
[56:45] the internet started to to Really cement
[56:49] itself into Global
[56:51] economics it's pretty easy to see how
[56:53] gold failed and I think Lyn alden's book
[56:55] talks about that broken money really
[56:57] good book really big book um but just
[57:00] does a massive deep dive into into how
[57:03] money is we know it like fat currency as
[57:05] we know it how it how it failed why it
[57:07] is broken and she always posits one of
[57:11] those reasons is because it didn't keep
[57:13] up with technology we kind of were
[57:15] forced into a feed currency system on
[57:18] digital rails through that Swift Network
[57:20] because we we had to catch up uh the
[57:22] globe was opening up trade was opening
[57:25] up and this yellow Rock couldn't keep up
[57:29] with with that trade without trusted
[57:31] intermediaries and I think that you know
[57:34] there's a really good book called The
[57:35] Terror of Babel that speaks about
[57:37] Central Banking and so forth and the
[57:39] bank of international settlements and
[57:42] they there's an example in that book if
[57:43] I'm recalling it correctly um that
[57:45] illustrates the problems with trust in
[57:47] intermediary in particular with gold
[57:49] story so it goes back to World War II
[57:52] Germany invades
[57:53] Czechoslovakia everybody's got their
[57:55] gold stores
[57:56] at um at the bank of international
[57:59] settlements and you know there's a pile
[58:01] of gold here for Germany there's a PO of
[58:04] gold here for
[58:06] Czechoslovakia and Germany invades
[58:08] Czechoslovakia gets in contact with the
[58:10] bank of international settlements and
[58:11] said hey yo that big pile of gold with
[58:13] czechoslovakia's name on it that's now
[58:15] ours and Bank of international sentiment
[58:17] just turns around and says
[58:19] okay and right there is enough evidence
[58:22] to suggest why a trusted intermediary
[58:24] can't can't be trusted like you you
[58:26] there's no such thing as a trusted
[58:28] intermediary and that's where Bitcoin
[58:29] really solved the this notion of how do
[58:32] you move value at scale through space
[58:35] and time at the click of a button um
[58:38] without trusted intermediaries with a
[58:40] beer instrument and that's really the
[58:42] step change function in in why I say it
[58:45] was a game changer in terms of
[58:46] technology and it is this generation's
[58:49] ver version of the discovering
[58:50] electricity is because we finally fix
[58:52] the money it's finite it's durable it's
[58:55] portable all all of those things Bitcoin
[58:57] solves to a te and that's really when if
[58:59] I Circle back to right to the beginning
[59:01] of this conversation is he you fall down
[59:02] that rabbit hole so far so fast it was
[59:05] it was that realization of I got the
[59:08] gold thesis I got why we needed our
[59:10] money that worked but then when you
[59:12] start tearing the layers off and and
[59:14] start critically questioning why gold
[59:16] failed that's why and and you
[59:19] highlighted it earlier go the other big
[59:21] drawback to gold was it self
[59:23] cannibalizing um can cannibalizing
[59:25] nature
[59:26] as the big as gold price increases it
[59:30] only incentivizes production it only
[59:33] incentivizes these gold miners to ramp
[59:35] up production at some cost it is now
[59:40] viable to go and mine that really costly
[59:42] seen in the jungles of Peru it is now at
[59:46] some gold price profitable to go and
[59:49] extract the the the finite particles of
[59:52] gold that exist in seawater it is now
[59:55] you know economically viable to go and
[59:57] launch that rocket into space and go and
[59:59] mine that asteroid at some point in in
[60:01] gold and that was probably the big the
[60:03] big um penny drop moment for me was um
[60:06] coming across a difficulty adjustment
[60:08] and how Bitcoin solved that exact thing
[60:10] doesn't matter
[60:11] how high the Bitcoin price goes of
[60:14] course the higher bitcoin price goes
[60:17] more incentive is is is out there for
[60:20] these miners to go and ramp up
[60:21] production in improve their facilities
[60:25] improve efficiency genes buy more
[60:27] machines and try and get the bigger
[60:29] piece of that pie but through the
[60:31] difficulty adjustment doesn't matter how
[60:33] much more economic power you throw at
[60:35] that it's not going to inflate the
[60:37] supply any more than the self um the
[60:40] self-
[60:41] adjusting uh issuance rate of one block
[60:44] every 10 minutes with the harving cycle
[60:47] into perpetuity into you know into the
[60:50] projected 20 year 2140 till we M the
[60:52] last Bitcoin it will only be 21 million
[60:55] Bitcoin and we know with absolute
[60:58] certainty the issuance rate for the next
[60:59] 120 odd
[61:01] years that's amazing that that that we
[61:04] have that certainty that's like you
[61:06] don't have that certain certainty in
[61:08] anything else um how do you see Bitcoin
[61:11] now injecting with energy and
[61:13] electricity with Bitcoin mining how do
[61:15] you see that topic especially as an
[61:16] electrician
[61:18] also yeah it's a that's a that's
[61:20] probably a really really good question
[61:22] big question but um honestly I think it
[61:25] it will be
[61:27] the denomination for energy cost um it
[61:30] will all be costed in Bitcoin because
[61:32] Bitcoin and energy grids just are
[61:34] marriage made in heaven
[61:37] um there's a lot of excess in grids so I
[61:41] obviously being an electrical engineer I
[61:42] work on the grid I see daytoday the
[61:45] inefficiencies of grid operation and
[61:47] probably one of the easiest ways to
[61:49] explain to people is that grids are
[61:51] built for what we call maximum demand in
[61:53] the industry so your whole electricity
[61:56] grid from the poles the wires the
[61:58] infrastructure the generators everything
[62:01] is planned for the worst of days so the
[62:04] worst of days in Australia hot sticky
[62:07] summer periods there's you know 5% of
[62:11] the time we spend in this really high
[62:13] maximum demand zone of operation where
[62:17] you have to have generators available
[62:18] and most people don't realize or most
[62:21] people are starting to realize but um
[62:22] just for for those at home who don't
[62:25] when you turn that light switch on at
[62:26] home there has to be a generator running
[62:28] with available capacity to supply that
[62:30] power to you in real time so we're
[62:32] constantly forecasting what we call this
[62:35] demand what we call this maximum demand
[62:37] and we're trying to make sure that at
[62:39] any one time when everyone wants to turn
[62:41] their lights air conditioners ovens on
[62:43] at the same time we've got these
[62:44] generators available with enough
[62:46] capacity now where that presents is the
[62:49] opportunity for Bitcoin miners because
[62:51] what we really need to run a grid
[62:53] efficiently is controllable load
[62:57] fast flexible controllable load at scale
[63:00] and that's essentially what Bitcoin
[63:02] mining is and it's Unique in its respect
[63:05] that we can turn it off at a click of a
[63:07] dime and what that really presents is an
[63:09] opportunity for us to soak up the Delta
[63:11] between your normal demand level and
[63:14] your maximum demand level and we can
[63:16] soak up and monetize the capacity in
[63:18] between so what that means is is your if
[63:21] you build your grid out for 100%
[63:24] capacity okay but you spend most of your
[63:28] time at 20% there's that Delta in
[63:30] between of obviously not making any
[63:33] money you're not making any Revenue so
[63:35] if you can introduce a flexible load
[63:38] Source into that grid you can start to
[63:40] monetize the wasted capacity you can
[63:42] start to tap into that un underutilized
[63:45] capacity introduce another Revenue
[63:47] source and It ultimately makes
[63:49] everyone's bills cheaper because we're
[63:51] no longer having to subsidize running at
[63:54] 20% for 80% of the time time and and
[63:57] accounting for this this only very brief
[64:00] period of Maximum
[64:02] demand um by introducing that load
[64:05] Center you're introducing more revenue
[64:06] and that can be shared and distributed
[64:08] against um against everybody who Taps
[64:11] into that every consumer in that grid is
[64:13] ultimately
[64:14] subsidizing the cost of that grid and
[64:16] not being able to tap into all of its
[64:18] Revenue at any one time I'll probably
[64:19] just pause there because there's
[64:20] probably a lot of terms that I'm
[64:22] throwing around that you might want to
[64:23] um ask some questions about but um yeah
[64:26] essentially it's just the game changer
[64:28] and being able to monetize unused
[64:31] capacity what I'm also interested in is
[64:35] like how will Bitcoin mining be
[64:37] incorporated in the future in all our
[64:41] electricity grids we already have things
[64:45] like 21 energy and and other providers
[64:47] that basically provide space Heats with
[64:50] Bitcoin mining um but then maybe we even
[64:54] have in the future where there's like a
[64:56] village and there's like a section or
[64:57] region that uses on a very small scale
[65:01] level for like maybe five 10 50 houses a
[65:05] Bitcoin minor to balance the load or
[65:08] maybe that's even possible on a houseo
[65:10] house basis where like every house has
[65:13] uh or every bigger house who facilitates
[65:16] a few people um has some sort of Bitcoin
[65:19] miner uh with I don't know maybe like
[65:22] solar energy and stuff like that on on
[65:23] the roof uh to the better the load and
[65:26] monetize on otherwise wasted energy
[65:30] because what from what I understand is
[65:33] it's best to use the energy right away
[65:35] like that's the most efficient way
[65:37] whenever you transfer it and try to keep
[65:40] it for a longer time or longer distances
[65:41] you lose a lot in in the process so it
[65:45] just makes sense for me in my head even
[65:47] though I have no clue and no experience
[65:49] in that field but it just makes sense in
[65:51] my head of like using Bitcoin mining uh
[65:55] to monetize and otherwise wasted energy
[65:57] and monetize on that and balance the
[66:00] load even on a very small local level
[66:03] yeah what what it really represents is
[66:05] an opportunity for us to finally be able
[66:08] to generate at smaller scale so
[66:11] traditionally why we end up with these
[66:13] massive networks massive transmission
[66:14] networks and I'll just illustrate how
[66:16] big our networks can be so in Australia
[66:18] we're a massive country we can fit a
[66:21] good portion of Europe just within
[66:23] Australia and we have an interconnected
[66:25] grid all the way from the top of
[66:27] Queensland right down through to
[66:29] Tasmania and it punches into South
[66:31] Australia don't know the exact
[66:33] kilometers over but it's thousands of
[66:35] kilometers of interconnected
[66:36] transmission Network and why we've done
[66:39] that in the past is because we haven't
[66:41] had load centers coupled with the
[66:44] generators so that you can tap
[66:47] into uh the the economics you can't you
[66:50] can tap into the the capacity there and
[66:53] monetize it in real time so we've had to
[66:55] build out this network so that we can
[66:56] share it across vast distances but you
[66:59] have a lot of losses in that and what I
[67:01] think Bitcoin mining represents is an
[67:04] opportunity where you'll have smaller
[67:07] scale community and smaller scale grid
[67:09] starting to because you can anytime you
[67:12] put a generator in now we can park a
[67:13] load Center and flexible load center
[67:15] right next door and you can soak up all
[67:17] of that demand uh all of that
[67:19] generational capacity rather in real
[67:21] time and monetize that so all of these
[67:23] projects become more economical and you
[67:25] don't need the grid you don't need this
[67:27] massive transmission Network because if
[67:29] I go and put a 60 gaw wind farm right at
[67:32] the top of Texas like like they did
[67:34] there's no customers there to sell it to
[67:36] so I've just put this massive Wind Farm
[67:39] up there so I need this big
[67:40] interconnected transmission grid to be
[67:43] able to send that energy down to where
[67:45] the the load Center is so rather than
[67:48] doing the 60 gaw Wind Farm now we can do
[67:51] smaller lots of wind farms generators
[67:54] nuclear small modules reactors and we
[67:57] can start to build community in and
[67:59] around smaller generation bases and this
[68:02] comes back to brandom quiddam I think is
[68:04] the gentleman wrote a really really good
[68:07] article a few years ago how um Bitcoin
[68:11] is a pioneer species Bitcoin is a
[68:13] pioneer species and it can actually
[68:15] demonetize real estate in the way that
[68:18] real estate generally big cities
[68:20] generally um started to Center in and
[68:23] around transport so access to Rivers
[68:26] access to shipping that's where and and
[68:29] energy centers so this is where City
[68:32] started to build out now it's not very
[68:35] profitable or economical for you to go
[68:37] out in the middle of the desert and
[68:38] start your own Community out there
[68:39] because you don't have access to all
[68:41] those resources but one of the things
[68:43] that Bitcoin mining solves is the energy
[68:45] piece so you can potentially now have
[68:48] small generators and small grids start
[68:51] to build out we're seeing this in um in
[68:53] Africa in Mala U with grid list
[68:56] they're starting to partner with these
[68:58] where there is an energy source but it's
[68:59] been uneconomical to build in the past
[69:03] they partnering up with these
[69:04] hydrogenerators where there's a a stream
[69:07] be able to divert that stream run it
[69:09] through a
[69:10] hydrogenerator share in the profit
[69:12] generate Bitcoin in real time turn that
[69:14] wasted energy into a monetary good and
[69:18] then use the monetary good to go and
[69:19] build out the grid and they're starting
[69:21] to connect these little sort of mud hot
[69:23] Villages for one of a better term and
[69:25] and the economic growth that that's um
[69:27] that's starting to to to see in those
[69:30] Villages is is absolutely standing
[69:32] they're now able to have a shop where
[69:35] they have refrigeration they can sell
[69:36] meat they can have a butcher they can
[69:38] have all of these things that they
[69:39] weren't able to do in the past because
[69:41] they didn't have access to energy and if
[69:43] you scale that back up into like a
[69:45] country like
[69:46] Australia Austria you can then start to
[69:49] tap into some of those
[69:52] unrealized um real estate areas
[69:54] potentially over
[69:56] time tap into the energy resources that
[69:58] are there whether that is hydro solar
[70:01] wind or we're starting to see small
[70:03] modular reactors and you can actually
[70:05] start to share and build out smaller
[70:08] community and then mine Bitcoin and it's
[70:10] all done through being able to tap into
[70:13] and utilize the maximum profitable
[70:15] operating region of these generators
[70:17] that's what it always comes down to is
[70:19] where's where's the maximum profitable
[70:22] operating region for that generator and
[70:24] how do we tap into that to make make
[70:25] sure we're turning that energy into
[70:27] monetary good so in a way it helps to
[70:30] decentralize and stabilize the crit the
[70:32] energy absolutely absolutely I love that
[70:36] that that's an amazing I think um we we
[70:40] always talk about how to get Bitcoin in
[70:44] more facet of our lives and I think that
[70:47] angle is probably the best one to
[70:50] describe it to other uh politicians and
[70:52] decisions maker because it seems to only
[70:55] have advantages you can monetize one you
[70:58] can it's renewable uh you can really
[71:00] like all those things that politicians
[71:03] care about grid stabilization you can
[71:05] really achieve with with Bitcoin money
[71:07] and it's it's amazing to see that and I
[71:10] know uh there is in Germany and Austria
[71:13] companies that already do that and talk
[71:15] with poist and try to to to Really push
[71:19] that uh and we we have to do this across
[71:22] the world and and and push it as as hard
[71:25] as hard as you can because Bitcoin
[71:27] mining and goes through that um goes
[71:30] through that image shift all of the
[71:32] sudden right now where like two years
[71:34] ago everyone said like oh it's so bad
[71:36] for the environment and now we're kind
[71:38] of th those voices really get silent and
[71:41] silent and Silent more silent and now
[71:43] we're getting to the other side of like
[71:46] where can we bit use Bitcoin mining to
[71:48] actually better our energy grids to
[71:51] better to be more efficient and actually
[71:53] benefit the environment in the end of
[71:55] the day so I I I love that narrative
[71:57] shift it's it's it's amazing and we are
[72:00] finally coming closer to the to the
[72:02] truth and uh I'm I'm actually kind of
[72:04] seeing even like mainstream media kind
[72:06] of um getting in that direction slowly
[72:09] and slowly I don't know how much um
[72:11] Black Rock ETF and president talking
[72:14] about it and uh mainstream politicians
[72:17] coming in the scene has to do with that
[72:19] probably a lot uh but yeah it's it's
[72:22] great to see that this narrative kind of
[72:25] slowly opens up to to be more friendly
[72:27] towards
[72:29] Bitcoin and I think the other thing
[72:31] which is really understated and and
[72:33] under misunderstood is its ability to
[72:36] fix the problems that have already
[72:38] started to creep into grids um so so one
[72:42] of the things that's uh not very well
[72:44] known is that the more um Renewables you
[72:48] put into a grid the more problems that
[72:50] it actually introduces and um this is
[72:53] all around rotating machines so rotating
[72:56] machines are a fundamental part of a
[72:58] grid okay so a rotating machine is
[73:01] basically just a big flywheel it's a big
[73:03] uh you know most mostly coal or gas fire
[73:06] generators or nuclear generators it's a
[73:09] basically heat generating steam in a
[73:12] turbine spinning a big flywheel in a
[73:14] magnetic field and that's how you
[73:16] produce electricity now the important
[73:18] thing around this big Mass spinning
[73:21] around in this um magnetic field is it
[73:23] creates two things well one is it's the
[73:25] stability of the Grid it's the heartbeat
[73:27] of the grid okay it sets the frequency
[73:29] of the grid so in Australia it's 50 HZ
[73:32] us it's 60 HZ most of Europe's
[73:34] combination 50 HZ 60 HZ all around the
[73:36] world but that 50 HZ is really really
[73:38] important to maintain and we only have a
[73:41] finite band in and around that 50 HZ
[73:43] setting to be able to play with because
[73:46] machines don't like it okay so if we
[73:49] have too much uncontrolled generation
[73:52] out on a electricity grid which we we
[73:55] experien this on a daily basis in
[73:57] Australia we call it the duck curve
[73:58] effect I might just share a little image
[74:00] with you on my screen yeah cool so um we
[74:03] we're talking about um the duck curve
[74:06] effect so too much uncontrolled
[74:09] generation and that's typically now what
[74:11] we're starting to see in most grids
[74:13] globally we're starting to see too much
[74:14] rooftop solar which is uncontrolled
[74:17] solar uh and then we're starting to see
[74:20] um obviously more wind and Renewables so
[74:24] uncontrollable
[74:25] unpredictable not necessarily reliable
[74:28] but the most important thing is is not
[74:30] hyperbole it actually does put real
[74:33] world effects on the grid so we're
[74:35] speaking a little bit um just about
[74:37] rotating machines and this notion of
[74:39] stability and the frequency that a
[74:41] rotating machine provides a grid is to
[74:43] set that heartbeat for that grid now
[74:45] when you've got too much uncontrolled
[74:47] generation like we're seeing with this
[74:49] duck curve effect and we're seeing this
[74:51] globally anywhere that has a real lot of
[74:53] solar we're starting to see this this
[74:55] duck curve effect and what you can see
[74:56] is um what we're seeing here is a is a
[74:58] is a graph and it's got obviously looks
[75:01] like a duck and that's why they call the
[75:03] that curve effect but we're starting to
[75:04] see more and more Ingress of solar um so
[75:08] you can see each year we just getting
[75:10] more and more penetration of the solar
[75:12] but what this really represents is
[75:14] through that period of the day where
[75:15] we've got a lot of solar we're starting
[75:17] to have too much
[75:19] generation and not enough load um so
[75:22] this graph doesn't really represent it
[75:24] but the the patterns um very um very
[75:27] true in most of these grids and in
[75:30] Queensland in particular we're really
[75:31] starting to see so much generation then
[75:34] not enough load that it's starting to
[75:36] have an impact on our heartbeat for the
[75:38] Grid it's actually starting to have an
[75:40] impact on that rotating machine it's
[75:42] actually starting to make our heartbeat
[75:44] race we're actually getting too much
[75:46] generation not enough load and your
[75:48] heartbeat starts to speed up and I spoke
[75:51] before we've only got a finite band
[75:53] between safe operation before equipment
[75:56] starts blowing up um everything's set
[75:58] for 50 HZ everything's built for 50 HZ
[75:59] in Australia all you have to be is 52 HZ
[76:03] plus and we start to see really drastic
[76:05] effects on the grid so when you have too
[76:07] much of this uncontrolled generation not
[76:09] enough load that's really what we're
[76:11] experiencing there's not enough load
[76:12] through the day everyone's at work we've
[76:14] got so much Generation Now that we and
[76:18] these rotating machines they need a lot
[76:19] of load like the older machines needed
[76:22] you know upwards of 50% of load to be of
[76:25] their of their rated capacity to be
[76:27] actually operating at optimal um optimal
[76:30] efficiency uh without causing too much
[76:32] un un undue um uh duress and stress on
[76:37] that machine without um introducing too
[76:39] much maintenance that needed to be done
[76:41] like glazing of balls and all these
[76:42] sorts of things with when you're talking
[76:43] about like diesel generators that's
[76:45] probably something most people can
[76:46] relate to they like load these rotating
[76:48] machines like load and when you can't
[76:50] give it enough load then we start
[76:52] turning these machines off and that's
[76:54] obviously very very dramatic for a grid
[76:57] and one of the biggest impacts on us
[77:00] switching rotating machines off in a
[77:02] grid is we lose inertia so inertia is
[77:05] this flywheel operating in this magnetic
[77:08] field that actually provides us when we
[77:10] refer to inertia in a grid we like fault
[77:12] current when we have a problem on the
[77:14] network we make decisions based on our
[77:17] ability to observe fault current and
[77:19] what provides that fault current is this
[77:21] big flywheel spitting in this magnetic
[77:22] field when a power line drops down onto
[77:25] a ground on the ground or clashes
[77:27] together it generates fault current it
[77:30] generates a lot of current a lot of heat
[77:32] but that fault current we Monitor and we
[77:34] make decisions so when we see really
[77:36] high levels of current we just assume
[77:39] that something's wrong and we switch off
[77:40] the network when we have the and we rely
[77:43] on these rotating machines to be able to
[77:45] provide the inertia to provide the
[77:47] rotation in that magnetic field to be
[77:49] able to push that fault current in those
[77:51] bad conditions and when we have too much
[77:53] of this generation we're starting to
[77:55] turn off these rotating machines and it
[77:57] leads to a non non-stable and
[78:01] non-reliable grid um so when people it's
[78:05] easy to say you hear it all the time
[78:07] like um uh
[78:09] Renewables you know introduces
[78:11] instability and it's not reliable that's
[78:13] the reason for it there there's actually
[78:15] science behind it there's actually a
[78:16] reason behind why people say that is and
[78:18] and it's misunderstood that you need
[78:21] load and that's again where Bitcoin
[78:24] miners can fix this problem so we've
[78:25] already gone down this route of giving
[78:27] everyone rebates to go and put all these
[78:29] solar panels on their roof so we've got
[78:31] to fix the problem there's is a real
[78:33] world problem created mostly by poor um
[78:35] poor government
[78:37] policies to go out and and we can
[78:40] understand the reason we want to reduce
[78:41] people's consumer bills but at the end
[78:43] of that still cost the same to produce
[78:45] they still want the grid they still want
[78:46] the grid connection it still cost us the
[78:48] same to maintain that grid so it's
[78:50] actually driven the Bas lab prices for
[78:52] energy up because we have to maintain it
[78:55] now when we've got too much generation n
[78:58] enough load that's where the Bitcoin
[79:00] mining comes into play so we can soak up
[79:03] this the belly of the duct curve we can
[79:04] bring it back up to equ an equilibrium
[79:07] level back up to where it's safe and
[79:09] effective operation of their rotating
[79:11] machines because we need those rotating
[79:13] machines we can't simply turn them off
[79:15] love so like what from what I understand
[79:18] is like that belly of duck is where
[79:21] everyone is at work and don't uses the
[79:23] the things at home then everyone comes
[79:25] home turns on lights turns on uh uh the
[79:30] the heating turns on the TV turns on
[79:32] internet more like that's where like
[79:34] most of the electricity is then used at
[79:37] like like starting from like 7 p.m. to
[79:41] like 9 10 p.m. stuff like that where
[79:43] then at like yeah like 12:00 p.m. people
[79:46] go to bed again where it go lower it's
[79:49] really interesting I never thought about
[79:50] that that's that's an interesting one
[79:53] and then like we we introduce the
[79:56] Bitcoin miners through the day we soak
[79:58] up the belly and then at night time when
[80:00] you need it CU that's the maximum demand
[80:02] and we we we don't want to be competing
[80:04] with the maximum demand so and that's
[80:06] where at scale where we want to
[80:09] introduce load at scale the only thing
[80:11] that can do that in a flexible way is
[80:14] Bitcoin miners you can't do it with AI
[80:16] data centers you can't do it with
[80:17] aluminium smelters or steel mills the
[80:20] only thing that you can do it at scale
[80:23] quickly efficiently and flexibly is
[80:26] Bitcoin money interesting H that's
[80:28] that's amazing that's an amazing point
[80:30] that again makes uh makes it so clear
[80:33] that we we need Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[80:35] mining um we are already F five off the
[80:39] time but uh one topic because you
[80:41] mentioned it and I'm really curious
[80:43] about it um what I want to get into is
[80:46] the fast reading aspect uh of of what
[80:48] you have mentioned maybe we can quickly
[80:51] uh touch on that before we get to the
[80:52] end routine um what did you do there
[80:55] like how how did you get more
[80:57] information in a small amount of time in
[81:00] your head yeah noce yeah I can wrap that
[81:02] up pretty quickly so um I went down I
[81:05] was just getting like more and more
[81:06] books on my bookshelf that I wanted to
[81:08] read wanted to read and it just kept
[81:09] growing and growing and growing I didn't
[81:11] seem to be making any Headway into
[81:13] tapping into all these books and you
[81:15] know there was just too many on my two
[81:17] two read list uh so I tried to teach
[81:20] myself how to speed reading there's a
[81:21] number of techniques you can do and and
[81:23] mostly it's easier to with a physical
[81:26] book not necessarily um Kindles or
[81:28] e-readers but um uh you know I was
[81:31] looking at a number of different
[81:33] techniques to try and introduce uh or
[81:35] will improve my my reading speed so
[81:37] bringing in the margins using your
[81:39] finger to trace being conscious of your
[81:42] eyes dating back um rereading the same
[81:45] passages but one of the things they talk
[81:46] about is to turn off your inner
[81:48] monologue so when you read are you
[81:51] verbalizing and you reading it to
[81:52] yourself in your head um call that the
[81:54] inner monologue and that's something
[81:56] that I found I couldn't switch off
[81:58] easily I like to verbalize um without it
[82:01] I'm not really getting uh a lot of
[82:03] comprehension and I struggled to turn
[82:06] that off uh so one thing I discovered
[82:08] was that um at the time I was reading a
[82:10] lot on Kindle and I was also I don't
[82:13] tend to resonate with audio books I can
[82:15] listen to a podcast listen to it at two
[82:17] times speed pay attention get a lot of
[82:21] attention but with an audio book it's
[82:22] different I have to be present um
[82:25] otherwise my mind drifts and then I
[82:27] realized I'm two chapters deep and I
[82:28] haven't you know haven't listened to a
[82:30] word that they've said I have to go back
[82:32] so I waste a lot of time with audio
[82:33] books but what I discovered was that if
[82:36] I'm reading the Kindle book and at
[82:38] checkout I can add the whisper sync
[82:40] version the audible version of that same
[82:42] book to um the checkout what I learned
[82:46] to do was listen to the narrator while I
[82:49] read the book and then speed up the
[82:51] narrator now the narrator that was um
[82:54] could only do that within finite limits
[82:56] because the narrator um is you can only
[82:59] push the narrator as far as um how
[83:02] articulate they are when they're
[83:03] speaking so if they're not very
[83:05] articulate and they don't ran their vows
[83:07] very very much and and and not very
[83:09] punctual um then that tends to blur so
[83:13] what I do is I use an app I call I use
[83:16] an app called voice stream reader and
[83:18] basically it's a just a text to voice
[83:20] converter um and it's robot voices and
[83:22] that do take a little bit of time to get
[83:24] used to but they are very articulate
[83:26] because they're a robot um so what you
[83:29] can do is over time is train yourself to
[83:31] listen at a a fastest speed but the key
[83:33] is to read at the same time so as you
[83:36] you import the book you train yourself
[83:39] over time just keep pushing your speed
[83:41] Beyond Comprehension then dollar back
[83:43] push Beyond Comprehension just dollar
[83:45] back push Beyond Comprehension dollar
[83:46] back and then over time you can speed
[83:49] yourself up now this is not me reading
[83:51] for pleasure it's reading for learning
[83:52] it's it's just a deep dive but basically
[83:55] you can sit down in one session and
[83:57] consume a whole book um done it many
[84:00] many times where you know it's a subject
[84:02] matter that you're interested in just
[84:03] sit down in one session like a 300 page
[84:06] book you can chew through in about two
[84:07] hours and with fairly High retention
[84:10] rate I'm not going to say very high like
[84:12] as as in 100% retention no um about 80%
[84:15] retention is is pretty common and um
[84:18] it's just one way that you can consume a
[84:20] lot of content really quickly and it's
[84:22] good for studying if you're at Uni or um
[84:25] whatever you got to chew through the
[84:26] textbook you know there's just a tone of
[84:28] information you've got to get through um
[84:31] it's just a great way of being able to
[84:32] absorb a lot of information um very
[84:35] quickly that's amazing yeah that that
[84:37] that that strategy I do I currently I'm
[84:41] only listening and I'm only doing as a
[84:45] as a kind of pause like as a prak so I
[84:48] have the speed of like maybe one or two
[84:50] books a month like really slow I mean
[84:55] kind of slow like one two weeks one two
[84:57] books a month I don't know how how many
[84:59] you do uh but I do like it as a as a
[85:02] kind of a change of scenes I also don't
[85:04] do any Bitcoin books or anything related
[85:06] to that I usually try to go out of that
[85:09] scene I don't do any um pleasure
[85:13] readings for like novels or fiction
[85:16] stuff like that I I never did that
[85:18] actually I I should I should try it once
[85:20] and I never did that I have to I have to
[85:23] see how it goes with that also um but
[85:26] yeah we have one question that each and
[85:28] every one of my guests get um before we
[85:30] come to the end and it is what can we
[85:32] learn from you besides Bitcoin the
[85:34] hustle I think um probably more than
[85:36] anything is um uh I I I'm a uh part-time
[85:41] guitarist and singer um and I think more
[85:43] more than anything I think most
[85:46] people uh getting to a point in their
[85:48] lives where they need more income right
[85:52] and um what what I like what I mean by
[85:54] the hustle is just finding something
[85:57] that you're passionate about that you're
[85:58] good at everyone's got a skill or an
[86:00] interest and there are ways that you can
[86:02] monetize that interest like obviously
[86:04] gigging and playing guitar and singing
[86:05] is probably a little bit easier than
[86:07] than than some others but I I I do
[86:09] encourage people to try and tap into
[86:11] that um because there are ways that you
[86:13] can generate income and generate a side
[86:15] hustle uh generate even passive income
[86:18] out of your passions um and and to
[86:21] really hone into that so I think that's
[86:22] probably something that share um quite
[86:25] openly with a lot of friends and family
[86:27] in around ways in which they can shift
[86:30] an needle for themselves particularly if
[86:32] you're stuck in a job that you don't
[86:33] particularly like or you've only got a
[86:35] certain set of skills in terms of being
[86:37] able to to work and you can't put more
[86:39] effort into your work to get overtime
[86:41] and all that sort of thing there are
[86:42] industries that that's not a possibility
[86:44] but um if you if you are in a situation
[86:47] where you want to make change for
[86:49] yourself to increase income is focus on
[86:52] your passion and try and turn that into
[86:54] um into into something that you can make
[86:56] money out of that's amazing I never was
[86:59] focused on that but I kind of did that
[87:03] the podcast but yeah like it's an
[87:05] amazing thing to do and uh something
[87:08] everyone should at least try to do and
[87:10] and follow the things thank you so much
[87:12] for that we have end uh of the podcast
[87:15] where the previous guest is asking a
[87:16] question for the next guest without
[87:17] knowing who the next guest actually is
[87:19] and your question from the previous
[87:21] guest is what is the moral impact
[87:24] of Bitcoin what is the moral impact of
[87:27] Bitcoin H that's a really good one I
[87:30] think it's bringing people back to
[87:34] truth um it's it's really starting to I
[87:39] mean any Bitcoin you meet you you
[87:42] generally get on with very well and I
[87:45] think it tends to be because morally we
[87:48] see the world in very similar ways and I
[87:51] think it's starting to really fix this
[87:53] notion of about what it means to be
[87:55] human like we talk about praxiology and
[87:57] all these things a lot but really from
[87:59] its fundamental level with its whole you
[88:02] know low time preference all these
[88:05] things are starting to really resonate
[88:06] about what it actually means to be human
[88:09] and I think when you when you focus in
[88:12] on providing value being a good human
[88:16] you know um I I think it just fixes us
[88:20] as as Humanity it it just makes us
[88:22] interact with each other
[88:24] um in a non-extractive way and that's a
[88:27] good thing to to think about like it
[88:29] makes a it it brings us closer to how
[88:33] humans actually like the the fear is
[88:35] kind of intruding on our lives it's kind
[88:38] of um manipulating of of of how we act
[88:43] with with Fe and money and Bitcoin kind
[88:45] of brings us back to that I like that
[88:47] explanation it's it's a really good one
[88:49] um perfect and thank you so much D for
[88:52] being on before I let you go where can
[88:53] people find you ask your questions and
[88:55] and reach out to you yeah best ways uh
[88:58] on nosta da doz um on Twitter at dab da
[89:03] Bea um and looking glass education where
[89:06] you'll find a whole host of um free
[89:08] education resources including some um
[89:11] some courses and finally beers for
[89:13] Bitcoin um myself and Seb bunny
[89:15] published a book uh written for wage
[89:17] earners really distilling down Bitcoin
[89:20] um helps with that conviction right we
[89:21] spoke about that a bit earlier how
[89:24] worked um in layman's terms uh trying to
[89:27] distill down what is otherwise a very
[89:29] complex subject um into easy to
[89:32] understand language so you'll find that
[89:34] on um self-publishing on Amazon or the
[89:36] infinity bookstore um with canut and
[89:38] Luke um you find that published over
[89:40] there um as well as the free Madera
[89:42] Foundation I've got a bookstore now as
[89:44] well you'll find beers for Bitcoin
[89:46] available there perfect thank you so
[89:48] much D for being on also thank you so
[89:50] much for everyone that is watching and
[89:52] listening for joining us today as always
[89:54] I'll be back tomorrow with another
[89:55] episode bye-bye
