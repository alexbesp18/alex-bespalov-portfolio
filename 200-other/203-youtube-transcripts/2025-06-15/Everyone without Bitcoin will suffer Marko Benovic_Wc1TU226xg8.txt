[00:00] it's inevitable I hope the Fiat as
[00:02] currency it dies off in the next 100
[00:05] years for the benefit of ordinary people
[00:07] because they suffer the most even with
[00:09] people trying to slowing it down they
[00:11] are weirdly enhancing it not interest
[00:14] for the price you're in for if something
[00:16] overnight happens with the fat world
[00:18] you're you're good I hope the transition
[00:20] to sound money standard is peaceful can
[00:23] only lose if nobody talks about it and
[00:25] nobody uses it and nobody does anything
[00:28] it happens relatively soon gradually and
[00:30] uh
[00:32] permanently I saw in the research about
[00:35] you that you wrote an article about
[00:38] Bitcoin innovat like Bitcoin is inable
[00:41] you also have a Consulting f for company
[00:44] with the same
[00:46] name before we get into everything why
[00:49] do you think is is that true like why do
[00:51] you think Bitcoin is inevitable and can
[00:54] there not be like a Black Swan or
[00:56] something like
[00:57] that yeah I mean I think even in the
[01:00] article I write that um any system can
[01:04] fail so nothing is truly inevitable like
[01:08] we can be hit by a meteorite tomorrow
[01:10] and and disappear overnight and no one
[01:12] would know that we ever
[01:14] existed but but but in the context of of
[01:17] our reality um and the way we live lives
[01:21] I think Bitcoin is
[01:23] inevitable uh because I think it is
[01:25] ultimately uh conducive to human
[01:28] behavior so
[01:30] whatever that means there are underlying
[01:32] trades of Bitcoin that are I think
[01:34] conducive to to humans and how we want
[01:37] to transact value through space and time
[01:40] and um I mean for example that's the
[01:42] reason why we chose gold organically and
[01:44] spontan spontaneously through time um
[01:47] and that now we have the emergence of
[01:49] Bitcoin um with the um i' say better
[01:52] trades um compared to to gold so I think
[01:57] over the long term uh long run um I
[02:00] think it's inevitable because it will be
[02:02] chosen um for all those underlying
[02:05] trades that Bitcoin has um so when I
[02:09] looked into the How would how would I
[02:13] describe Bitcoin they say
[02:16] like it's inevitable um and in that
[02:19] sense that's why I call the the company
[02:21] the whole Endeavor kind of inevitable
[02:23] but of course with the caveat that um
[02:26] nothing is inevitable um there is always
[02:29] um a non zero chance that something can
[02:31] go wrong any system actually described
[02:33] that in the article I say life as such
[02:35] can disappear overnight so uh but I
[02:38] think the underlying traits of Bitcoin
[02:41] um in this context of um reality that we
[02:45] live in um make it inevitable yeah
[02:49] definitely and and everything uh has a
[02:51] risk even like like there's this thing
[02:55] as long as you live you have risk abely
[02:58] absolutely yeah everything is risk yeah
[03:01] every move actually that you make is is
[03:03] in a way a risk in Opportunity so yeah
[03:06] and you can even if even if you stay at
[03:08] home and you're isolated uh then you eat
[03:11] something and you choke on it because
[03:13] nobody can help you because you're alone
[03:14] like there there's so many things that
[03:17] can go wrong and even but in in time
[03:20] when people say Bitcoin isn't avitable
[03:23] uh for me it's more like Bitcoin is the
[03:26] safest bet for the future like it's it's
[03:29] the it's the the best way to project
[03:31] yourself in the future and uh you also
[03:34] have a really interesting subtitle and I
[03:36] never heard the connection between Darin
[03:38] and Satoshi uh the connection between
[03:42] evolutionary biology and and Bitcoin why
[03:45] did you make this comparison and how do
[03:48] how do they
[03:50] connect oh that's a great question um
[03:53] how would I summarize that I think the
[03:57] The evolutionary biology gives us a good
[04:00] link to how we came about and then we
[04:03] link that to um how we grouped as
[04:06] species and then what we do as species
[04:09] um of course etc etc I'm trying to
[04:12] summarize the a long time frame uh in a
[04:14] in a couple of sentences but we moved
[04:17] from um you know being animals just
[04:19] living life to some kind of humans um
[04:24] later that engaged in in barter trade so
[04:28] um and then we we talk about money later
[04:30] uh in Bitcoin so I think um if we really
[04:33] want to understand the why I say the
[04:37] Bitcoin is conducive to to life as such
[04:40] we have to go back to evolutionary
[04:42] biology um and um and really seek for
[04:46] those answers how we evolve as humans
[04:49] and then uh why animals do certain
[04:52] things um of course if you accept the
[04:54] theory that we evolve from you know
[04:56] animals and um not animals but like the
[04:59] D dervinis um deranian um theory of
[05:04] evolution um so all species basically
[05:08] have certain behaviors that help them um
[05:13] reproduce and protect themselves and
[05:16] they do that um depending on their level
[05:20] of development um so it it differs from
[05:23] what bacteria do and what humans do um
[05:26] but we we're all in the business of
[05:28] extending this uh so I mean DNA chain
[05:31] basically so life um is basically Layer
[05:36] Two of uh DNA chain DNA chain being
[05:40] layer one that's why have this
[05:43] connection make this connection between
[05:45] uh Bitcoin layer one and the um
[05:48] DNA um actually we talked about it uh in
[05:51] one of the X spaces we had a couple of
[05:53] weeks ago
[05:55] um so yeah I think there is um nature
[05:59] builds this strong um base layers around
[06:04] which it builds abundance and I think
[06:08] Bitcoin is that uh layer one of
[06:11] certainty of the way people can transfer
[06:14] value through space and time around
[06:17] which abundance will be built and this
[06:19] is the parallel between I I think
[06:21] Bitcoin Satoshi and der venan Theory
[06:25] where um life is just a layer two
[06:29] basically around um that layer one being
[06:32] DNA chain um and once you have this
[06:35] certainty of code um beautiful things
[06:38] can be built around when you build
[06:40] something such a long-term almost
[06:43] indestructible layer then um abundance
[06:47] can be built so I I derive a lot of
[06:50] understanding of what Bitcoin can do to
[06:52] the world from from that from
[06:54] evolutionary biology I'm not a biologist
[06:56] in any way shapable form but just like a
[06:59] curious Observer um and in that sense I
[07:03] I simply link these these two uh points
[07:07] um because anything that you analyze we
[07:09] talk about risk or opportunities of Life
[07:11] anything stems from our behavior and who
[07:14] we are as as species and individuals so
[07:18] I think there is always if you want to
[07:21] understand why we do certain things
[07:22] there is
[07:24] always evolutionary biology is always a
[07:26] great starting point in understanding uh
[07:29] anything that we do
[07:31] today yeah definitely and I think it's
[07:34] always interesting to see where is the
[07:36] connection between stuff and when we
[07:39] then see uh Darin and The evolutionary
[07:42] we like um not as strong species or not
[07:46] as strong whatever die off and the
[07:49] stronger survive uh then we also come to
[07:52] the conclusion that cryptocurrencies the
[07:55] a lot of different ones I like to call
[07:57] them shitcoins
[08:00] some other like to call them altcoins I
[08:02] think there is no I think there is no
[08:04] alternative to bitcoin so I call them
[08:06] shitcoins yeah of course and and then we
[08:09] come to this conclusion where uh the
[08:12] those alternative coins to bitcoin will
[08:16] over time lose uh because the strongest
[08:19] has to
[08:20] survive uh with also uh I don't know if
[08:24] if there's a connection also with
[08:26] that um yes of course the
[08:30] uh it's not the strongest species that
[08:32] survive but the most adaptable adaptable
[08:34] ones but also the one that are in a way
[08:37] indestructible and I would add to that
[08:40] that give the most value to
[08:43] people if they're conducive to the laws
[08:47] of nature so that's why we have this
[08:49] decentralization in Bitcoin that is
[08:52] conducive to Nature centralization is
[08:53] not conducive to
[08:55] Nature um at least not at the level that
[08:58] we see centralized ation today
[09:01] um and I always compare for me
[09:05] um Bitcoin is like gold tokens and
[09:09] altcoins or shitcoins are like a car
[09:12] wash
[09:13] token they might have some utility but
[09:16] uh that cannot they cannot be money
[09:19] because a person owning a car wash can
[09:21] can print uh this TOS for his friends to
[09:24] wash the car maybe in that ecosystem
[09:26] they can wash car and have fun and maybe
[09:30] it can have some utility but it cannot
[09:32] become money so I'm not even um if we
[09:36] are in the business of trying to improve
[09:37] the world um okay we can talk about
[09:41] sometimes about altcoins and you know
[09:44] shitcoins Car Wash but you know life is
[09:47] not about just washing the car there are
[09:49] so many things that um you know Bitcoin
[09:53] solves um and Embraces in in this
[09:56] equation
[09:57] so yeah I have I make this clear
[10:00] distinction between Bitcoin and
[10:02] shitcoins um and I have no doubt that um
[10:07] there is a a difference between these
[10:09] two and it's not about survival of the
[10:13] fittest Bitcoin is in a way um
[10:17] undoubtedly the fittest and the
[10:19] strongest there is no competition in
[10:21] that sense yeah I mean I think as as you
[10:25] said it altcoins are not even in the
[10:27] competition to bitcoin even they're not
[10:30] even competing for the same thing
[10:31] they're maybe marketing as the same
[10:33] thing but they're not exactly what what
[10:36] what would you say is the biggest
[10:37] competition if bitco like like even if
[10:40] it has no real competition there's no
[10:43] comparable stuff like that but what
[10:45] would you say it's like the biggest
[10:47] competition to bitcoin that we have to
[10:49] go over is it like fat currency is it
[10:51] more like gold is it real estate for the
[10:53] store of
[10:55] value for me competition of Bitcoin is
[10:58] Bitcoin 20 next version of Bitcoin that
[11:01] will emerge
[11:03] maybe 200 years or 100 year or or 300
[11:06] years more sound money but I'm for that
[11:10] competition uh I don't see and I'm not
[11:13] saying this let's say to to kind of brag
[11:16] about it in a way about Bitcoin but um
[11:19] the the way Bitcoin is currently
[11:21] structured with the hash power the
[11:23] centralization um I believe it's um it
[11:28] doesn't have
[11:29] competition currently and you know what
[11:32] I'm I mean the I would like to see the
[11:34] soundest money win and if there is a
[11:37] better version of Bitcoin
[11:39] available call it how
[11:41] some name whatever um I'm I'm really
[11:46] happy to to see that because um I would
[11:48] really like the world to move onto the
[11:50] sound money standard rather than
[11:53] anything to use any I'm not invested in
[11:55] Bitcoin as much as in the sum money as
[11:58] such and Bitcoin is currently the
[12:00] soundest money that um Humanity has
[12:03] available so this is let's say
[12:07] the what I think about competition let
[12:10] say definitely and it's so interesting
[12:12] because uh we are so bullish and focused
[12:17] on bitcoin but it's only because it's
[12:19] sound money and when we when we then say
[12:22] Oh but what what happens if if if
[12:25] Bitcoin fails it's okay if it fails then
[12:29] it fails like then it never was really
[12:31] sound money then we were wrong then we
[12:33] will search for the next sound money and
[12:36] we will Embrace that one like I don't
[12:39] think it will fail I think it will
[12:41] completely um be the base layer of
[12:44] everything but even if we say it fails
[12:47] um then okay we were wrong but the the
[12:52] the principles that we teach about sound
[12:54] money they're still intact it's just a
[12:56] different that we need yeah I fully
[12:59] agree I I really hope it doesn't fail
[13:02] because it's a really good chance to
[13:04] move onto the sound money standard
[13:08] um yeah I think because of the nature of
[13:11] the of the Fiat money and the Fiat World
[13:15] Humanity has been incentivized to
[13:17] develop a solution for this bleeding
[13:19] rate of
[13:21] inflation and I think the we could say
[13:24] that there were
[13:25] trials with the hash cash or all this
[13:28] kind of crypto C to currencies to make
[13:30] digital sound money over the last um 50
[13:34] years
[13:35] maybe
[13:37] 20 um so this is the latest iteration of
[13:41] that attempt to to have sound money and
[13:46] currently it's successful and I think it
[13:48] will be successful as well
[13:51] um so yeah that that's the the the yeah
[13:57] yeah is there like I'm always wondering
[14:00] uh for people that have uh Bitcoin and
[14:02] understood it um was there like a light
[14:05] bulp moment for you where like oh crap
[14:07] now I understand Bitcoin now I know
[14:10] why was there like something that you
[14:12] learned about Bitcoin some something you
[14:15] heard about Bitcoin it's like oh okay
[14:17] that's why it's sound money and and
[14:20] further to the question did you get
[14:23] sound money standards before like this
[14:25] aan economics before Bitcoin or did you
[14:27] learn it with Bitcoin then
[14:30] that's it's a good question it's
[14:31] interesting because I was really uh deep
[14:33] into the Fiat world and the Kian School
[14:35] of
[14:37] Economics so I studied Kian School of
[14:39] Economics for all my University um
[14:42] studied economics Kian School
[14:45] particularly um it was really strong
[14:47] kesian School of economics in so I I had
[14:50] a huge feat bubble being built on one
[14:53] side and I live this fat world let's
[14:55] say and then I think my I first heard
[14:59] about Bitcoin in 2015 when a friend
[15:02] called me and said there's this
[15:05] cryptocurrency you know rising in
[15:06] certain number of percentages whatever I
[15:09] said it's a scam being part of the the
[15:11] Fiat world I I I just moved on I didn't
[15:15] look into it at
[15:16] all and then 2016 I did a CFA course
[15:21] level
[15:23] one to further inflate my field bubble
[15:26] personal field bubble and
[15:30] then I was just involved listening to
[15:34] podcasts about investing Etc actually I
[15:37] heard that you you were invested in
[15:39] Tesla I did the same some time ago uh
[15:43] and we have we have a similar story in
[15:44] that sense and then
[15:48] um 2018 I read the Bitcoin standard
[15:52] book and I was really lucky to really
[15:55] read it couple of month just after
[15:57] publishing and I was first
[16:01] astounded at what this is that there is
[16:04] a yeah it literally deleted my previous
[16:08] understanding of the world so there was
[16:10] a point I didn't know
[16:12] anything and it was
[16:14] really a kind of a spiritual moment I
[16:17] would
[16:18] say I don't want to say I was angry at
[16:20] myself but really I I spent a lot of
[16:22] time in this field world and then read
[16:25] the Bitcoin standard once and then
[16:29] this sounded too good to be true that
[16:31] there is a alternative economics based
[16:35] on subjective uh polarization of in
[16:39] Human Action etc
[16:40] etc not the classical economic schenian
[16:43] school where they solve everything with
[16:44] printing so I read twice Bitcoin
[16:47] standard and at that point I was I was
[16:49] really convinced and from then on um I
[16:52] started reading U Austrian School of
[16:55] Economics um
[16:57] economist
[17:00] and um but I would always come back to
[17:03] bitcoin standard book and actually I had
[17:05] the opportunity to meet sa uh in Miami
[17:08] Conference last year and I really
[17:10] thanked him for changing my life in that
[17:12] sense from uh Fiat world to the Bitcoin
[17:16] world and that's where the light bulb is
[17:18] basically that book that book is the
[17:20] instrumental in in my journey after that
[17:23] I read a lot of books on this topic and
[17:26] topic of some money and um
[17:30] so the the the transitional moment was
[17:32] definitely that book um and I just just
[17:35] kept reading kept reading and um just
[17:39] because it took me a while to build my
[17:41] conviction fully because coming from fat
[17:45] world it's not easy to um to kill your
[17:50] ego in that sense you want to believe
[17:53] that kyian school of Economics is still
[17:56] the way to go there's a problem with e
[17:59] economy you just print more money or
[18:00] print less money raise or lower interest
[18:04] rates but we shouldn't be in that
[18:06] business at
[18:08] all but swimming in that water as fish
[18:11] uh we don't know that the water is
[18:13] around us and and um it's really
[18:17] important for people that's what I said
[18:18] I can never convince anyone um to move
[18:22] onto the Bitcoin standard and Bitcoin
[18:24] way of thinking sound money thinking
[18:26] because it's really hard everything
[18:29] around us is Fiat world and um so I'm
[18:33] really I'm grateful for to have that
[18:36] light bulb switched on at some point U
[18:40] because I would just be part of the
[18:42] field world
[18:44] forever and um it's really hard to move
[18:47] on to uh the sound money low time
[18:50] preference thinking um if you are not
[18:54] curious
[18:55] somehow about um I don't even know what
[18:59] probably personal progress understanding
[19:01] of your own reality life how you want to
[19:04] uh conduct this Consciousness from birth
[19:07] to death um so yeah Bitcoin standard
[19:12] book U will always be my my first uh
[19:16] moment where I kind of really got a grip
[19:18] on bitcoin and why do you think it's so
[19:20] hard for people uh to understand aing
[19:23] economics I have so many uh cever and
[19:26] intelligent people uh in in my
[19:29] environment they just don't understand
[19:31] it they they truly think oh you have to
[19:34] print money in order to
[19:37] um trigger the economy in in order to
[19:41] help even poor people I heard this
[19:43] argument that we have to print money to
[19:47] help the poor people uh uh and it's like
[19:51] really like why why is that still so
[19:55] ingrained like of course it's teach to
[19:57] schools it's teach in the
[19:59] universities uh it's there's almost no
[20:03] Austrian economics like I studied
[20:05] economics in Austria I have others that
[20:09] studied economics in Austria there is no
[20:11] Austrian economics studies in AUST in
[20:15] economics yeah yeah um actually I
[20:19] studied economics in Austria as well U
[20:22] at e Vienna uh I was just a summer
[20:26] actually a winter student um was there a
[20:29] while for a couple of months Vienna um
[20:32] yeah you're right there is no Austrian
[20:34] economics in Austria it was also Kenan K
[20:38] School of Economics but back to your
[20:39] question why it is
[20:42] hard people are just too busy living
[20:44] their um existence I don't want to say
[20:48] blindly or unconsciously but yes in a
[20:50] certain to a certain degree they don't
[20:53] have maybe time due to the nature
[20:56] sometimes of the Fiat world to step back
[20:58] and and look look at their lives and see
[21:00] how they can be improved in all
[21:03] Realms um one of those Realms is my
[21:08] understanding of the world and
[21:11] um also when when when you're taught
[21:14] from very young age certain things it's
[21:18] really hard to to change your mindset on
[21:20] many things it can be
[21:22] nutrition exercising the way you conduct
[21:25] yourself in in public what whatever
[21:28] you're talk
[21:29] for a long time whatever is the main
[21:31] narrative it's really hard to change we
[21:33] can you know link that to um
[21:37] evolutionary biology if you want or or
[21:39] early societies where you have this main
[21:43] narrative that has to be propelled into
[21:45] the future forever and we are all
[21:47] invested into this main narrative and if
[21:49] you are against this main narrative um
[21:52] you are an enemy of the of the the
[21:56] society and and so you don't even try to
[21:59] look for other narrative because even if
[22:02] you find out another narrative um the
[22:06] the chances of you doing something
[22:08] meaningful with that might be low
[22:10] because you might be killed or something
[22:12] because you you saw you said that this
[22:14] road is is dangerous for our tribe to go
[22:18] we go all go that road we all
[22:20] die but uh you would be killed if you
[22:22] say that I I really don't know I think
[22:25] it's a personal it comes down to
[22:27] individuals and it comes down to this
[22:30] kind of individual accountability and
[22:33] responsibility to try to understand the
[22:36] world the best way possible and
[22:40] um this is where the answer lies why
[22:44] people don't want to understand uh not
[22:48] again not only Bitcoin but a lot of
[22:49] aspects of reality that are part of the
[22:52] narrative I would say Bitcoin is just um
[22:56] one part of of the narrative uh the fat
[22:59] world I mean fat money is just one part
[23:01] of the fat World
[23:03] narrative um so it comes down to if I
[23:08] had to summarize it in in in one
[23:10] sentence I would say
[23:12] to to desire for personal growth because
[23:16] that's where the answer lies uh for yeah
[23:21] understanding of
[23:23] um of
[23:25] anything including Bitcoin is will will
[23:29] that change uh once we get to a full
[23:32] Bitcoin adoption of like 50% 80% 90% uh
[23:36] people will get then a economics more
[23:39] will be teached a economics in schools
[23:42] and and also like how do you see Society
[23:45] changing on that because I think there's
[23:47] like we're now in a really small group
[23:50] of people that are pushing Bitcoin
[23:53] adoption are really early adopters so we
[23:55] are in like a a really small group group
[23:58] of people uh that see something in the
[24:01] future but once everybody is in there it
[24:04] will be a different kind of Bitcoin
[24:06] Community there will be no actual
[24:08] Bitcoin Community I think uh because
[24:10] it's like I now have a Bitcoin only
[24:13] podcast that talk every day about
[24:15] Bitcoin um in 20 30 years probably not
[24:18] because Bitcoin will be boring it's just
[24:20] in our everyday lives it's like I don't
[24:22] talk every day about email like it will
[24:25] be or about the tcpip protocol because
[24:28] at some point it will be boring uh maybe
[24:31] I talk about finance and and and stuff
[24:33] like that in general but do you see a
[24:36] world where then it gets boring and and
[24:39] and and people just get it why some
[24:42] money is better or is it still
[24:46] like I I I want to live in that world
[24:49] and um I I hope even anything they do
[24:52] around Bitcoin is building a little
[24:54] blocks towards that world yeah in that
[24:58] sense when the adoption rate is really
[25:00] high The Narrative will be Bitcoin
[25:02] itself and that's going to be the the
[25:05] the main money and we will be all part
[25:08] of that world and so the narrative will
[25:10] then be around of course Austrian School
[25:13] of Economics um there won't be central
[25:15] banks there'll be just this organic
[25:17] money uh Bitcoin um people will have
[25:20] understanding of the importance of hard
[25:23] money one point here is that I I I hope
[25:27] the transition to to sound money
[25:29] standard is
[25:31] peaceful because somehow I just don't
[25:34] see us learning this lesson gradually I
[25:39] have a feeling that something big has to
[25:41] fail for us to understand this and I'm
[25:44] really I'm a bit worried about you know
[25:47] the POS what it will take how much pain
[25:51] we need to to wake up and I hope the
[25:56] pain is low as possible suffering as
[25:59] well because um this is how humans learn
[26:03] the best when they experience pain at
[26:06] Large Scale
[26:09] um so
[26:11] hyperinflation uh
[26:13] Wars this reset of global reset towards
[26:18] Somey standard um because fat World
[26:22] brings a lot of nonsense uh with itself
[26:25] and perpetuates propels this and into
[26:28] the future
[26:30] so yes once we're on the Bitcoin
[26:32] standard it's going to be normal no one
[26:33] will talk about Bitcoin we will use
[26:35] Bitcoin the same way we use Fiat money
[26:37] today you just buy things with how much
[26:39] you have um but I'm a bit worried about
[26:43] the transition to that standard
[26:46] because what we do here in the podcast
[26:49] and in the Bitcoin world is we try to
[26:51] build this blocks so that we have this
[26:53] gradual transition and when people are
[26:55] ready maybe to show knowledge uh to to
[26:58] distribute knowledge um of the
[27:01] importance of sun money standard um but
[27:04] I I just don't feel that the
[27:07] um the receipt of our message is
[27:13] impactful enough for people
[27:16] to study it more when they feel pain
[27:20] maybe that's the that's where they will
[27:22] um jump onto the Bitcoin standard again
[27:25] I just hope that that that pain
[27:28] collectively is not
[27:29] huge um being for example a war or um
[27:34] some famine
[27:36] or whatever negative might affect us as
[27:40] Society on that road yeah it's
[27:43] fascinating to think of um like when we
[27:46] talk about the rise of Bitcoin uh there
[27:48] also has to be an fall of fat right
[27:53] there has to be um decreasing of fat and
[27:58] Lo of fat mindset and then increasing of
[28:00] B Bitcoin and Bitcoin mindset or sound
[28:02] money mindset um do you think uh like do
[28:06] you have like a timeline if if you're
[28:08] like oh I think Fe will not survive the
[28:11] next 50 years will not survive the 100
[28:13] years could survive 200 years um what
[28:16] what what is what are your thoughts on
[28:18] on the Fiat monetary system um because
[28:21] it's already I think um yeah impressive
[28:24] that it lives so
[28:26] long and unfortunately it can live for
[28:30] long
[28:31] more and that is because
[28:34] of how smart they cut us at this
[28:38] bleeding rate of two programmed
[28:41] inflation is of course 2% but we were
[28:44] not talking about 2% we're talking about
[28:46] 51 who knows who knows it's just not
[28:49] 2% but the way the lion cuts the whole
[28:54] herd to bleed thousands of antelopes
[28:58] 2 3% per
[29:00] year um can last for a for a long time
[29:04] and that's what I'm afraid the the the
[29:08] the biggest risk to this narrative is
[29:10] that the lion I call it a lion it's a
[29:12] central bank Cuts us um more and then we
[29:17] wake up um at a large scale and then we
[29:21] turn on to the the
[29:22] lion uh but if if they keep this
[29:28] narrative where they keep the prices
[29:31] stable they're not stable far from it
[29:34] they rise incredibly but people are
[29:36] still buying this people are buying this
[29:38] narrative um and um I think it can
[29:42] survive for at least um 20 50
[29:47] years um even 100 if we if there is no
[29:51] major
[29:53] problem with the dollar being U Global
[29:55] Reserve currency if they somehow manag
[29:58] to to service this debt to print to to
[30:01] keep interest rates
[30:04] um at reasonable levels inflation as
[30:07] well this bleeding bleeding can
[30:10] continue
[30:12] um but again inevitably and ultimately I
[30:16] think we will something will happen
[30:18] because the system is not
[30:20] sustainable uh you know there will be an
[30:23] antelope that's Satoshi who actually was
[30:26] that said like guys we're bleeding
[30:29] um I have a solution um there this is
[30:32] how we cut how we heal these wounds and
[30:35] how we even turn to the line and say
[30:38] look we don't want to attack you we can
[30:39] gradually heal ourselves and you just go
[30:43] away you just go away we know how to to
[30:45] deal with
[30:46] ourselves um I don't know that's a great
[30:48] example but this is how I you know try
[30:50] to uh think U this true um so unless
[30:56] there is a a big adverse
[31:01] monetary uh event happening it can
[31:05] survive for some time more um the global
[31:08] Reserve currency being dollar it's not
[31:11] that easy to to um
[31:15] overthrow as
[31:17] um as a global Reserve currency that's
[31:19] not easy to do and I think we're not
[31:22] even in the business of doing it
[31:23] overnight we want transition to be
[31:25] somehow gradual so there is a time for
[31:29] adjustment uh again I think anything
[31:31] that could happen really suddenly can
[31:32] lead to some kind of social Uprising or
[31:35] something um so I'm not even advocating
[31:37] for a fast transition but um I I would
[31:41] like to see the end of Fiat in the um by
[31:45] the end of this Century Fiat will be I
[31:48] think Fiat will be
[31:51] around even then in some some countries
[31:56] not in the form maybe that it is today
[31:59] it will could be linked to either
[32:00] Bitcoin or gold um over the next 50 100
[32:05] years but I I hope the the Fiat as as
[32:09] this
[32:11] uh
[32:12] currency Med exchange unfortunate store
[32:16] of wealth um it dies off uh in the next
[32:21] 100 years for the benefit of uh Ordinary
[32:25] People because they suffer the most
[32:27] through inflation through currency
[32:29] devaluation through uh fruits of their
[32:32] labor being devalued for inability to to
[32:35] save long term in the money that they
[32:38] earn um so I really hope it help it it
[32:43] happens relatively soon
[32:47] gradually and uh
[32:50] permanently but that's another story
[32:52] because once we um get into something
[32:56] permanent then we get a bit lazy as
[32:59] Society then these ideas of um some fast
[33:05] improvements like Fiat had Fiat Fiat is
[33:08] basically the Improvement um on on layer
[33:12] of gold where we could not transact gold
[33:14] so fast and and large distances so we
[33:17] accepted Fiat
[33:20] um even that was not Fiat Fiat that was
[33:23] a Fiat backed by gold but the real Fiat
[33:26] that gave the birth the gold standard
[33:29] gave the birth to to fiat currency not
[33:32] backed by gold because it it gave um
[33:36] cability or uh in people's minds paper
[33:40] suddenly had
[33:42] value as claims on gold so when we broke
[33:46] off the gold standard It's Paper U still
[33:49] had some uh notion of valid people's
[33:52] minds
[33:54] um and the mistake that we did there as
[33:58] Society or humanity is that we allowed
[34:01] this transition to usher in without
[34:04] knowing the full consequences of how it
[34:06] will
[34:07] unfold um so I don't want that to happen
[34:11] again on the Bitcoin standards so
[34:12] everything is fine now but then we find
[34:15] a way to to screw things up um so I
[34:19] advocate for this um Serenity in in in
[34:23] politics and uh
[34:25] economics um to to to to see things from
[34:28] the first principles and and build on
[34:30] the top of that not from some inflated
[34:32] layers and um questionable um economic
[34:37] policies that are really not backed by
[34:39] reason 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from
[34:42] day one and did teach and preach self-
[34:45] custody this is my goto exchange when
[34:48] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[34:51] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[34:53] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[34:56] fees Plus at the same time support this
[34:59] podcast use code Robin and click the
[35:02] link in the description will there be a
[35:04] something built on top of Bitcoin like a
[35:07] credit
[35:08] system or is there even the
[35:12] the threat that there will be some uh
[35:16] yeah fractural Reserve System uh on top
[35:19] of Bitcoin because people are too lazy
[35:23] to sell
[35:24] custody uh that's really happening I
[35:27] think that's also inevitable but um
[35:30] these are kind of pockets of human
[35:32] effort that I think cannot have the
[35:36] um negative impact on the Bitcoin layer
[35:39] one uh people will always strive for um
[35:43] ability to transact faster to to somehow
[35:46] do with something with Bitcoin on some
[35:48] kind of layers layers two um in certain
[35:51] ecosystems uh I think which which is
[35:53] fine as long as that ecosystem
[35:56] synchronizes itself with the Bitcoin
[35:59] layer one even over time so I
[36:04] think unless that inflates to the point
[36:07] where it over kind of powers the
[36:10] network I don't see that well but um
[36:14] that can be a slight risk but I I
[36:19] I'm I I I don't see because people will
[36:22] go back to layer one and build again if
[36:24] something bad happens in these layers
[36:27] layers too of how people use Bitcoin
[36:30] um do you see uh any other uh hurdles or
[36:35] or risk of threats to Bitcoin in the the
[36:37] coming years when you uh um see
[36:41] everything going on I think even the the
[36:43] Bitcoin ETF some people see it as a
[36:45] threat uh I think you wrote an article
[36:47] about how it's a trojan horse like it's
[36:50] a it's not a threat on bitcoin it's a
[36:51] threat on the Fiat system how do you see
[36:54] like future threats and maybe second
[36:56] question how do you see the Bitcoin ETF
[36:58] playing into
[37:00] this about future
[37:03] threats the threats that I see could be
[37:06] somehow linked to
[37:09] um you know the the 51% attack that
[37:13] explain to me that it's really hard to
[37:15] do even if you're a nation state so that
[37:19] could be if if someone could challenge
[37:21] the IND distractability of the Bitcoin
[37:24] blockchain you know making Bitcoin every
[37:26] 10 minutes
[37:28] discovering it of course they're already
[37:30] written in the code that that that could
[37:33] be a threat that is kind of legitimate
[37:35] to me um and I so far I have not heard
[37:40] of a good
[37:41] argument that that some somehow
[37:44] something could we talked about
[37:47] quaning quanum computers or this kind of
[37:51] advaned computing power that could
[37:53] somehow come into the equation and maybe
[37:56] perform this 1% attack but
[38:00] um I'm not that technical to uh go
[38:04] really to the depth of it but the way I
[38:07] understand it um it's it's not easy
[38:10] so on on the because I see Bitcoin
[38:13] Bitcoin just a a code that works
[38:15] decentralized code that has its protocol
[38:18] and we humans um give it value and we
[38:21] humans see it on the from kind of a
[38:25] bird's eye view and Bitcoin just a layer
[38:28] of of something happening um so our
[38:32] perception changes every day that we we
[38:33] see in the price how we perceive Bitcoin
[38:37] it's not relevant to bitcoin itself um
[38:40] sometimes I think I wrote it in the our
[38:42] telegram group um I'm laughing at this
[38:46] how humans see such a pristine protocol
[38:49] it just makes Bitcoin and it just it
[38:51] just keeps living and we are giving it
[38:53] price today 10,000 3,000 5,000 40,000
[38:56] 100,000 it's like a we still live in
[39:00] this Fiat world uh on you know kind of a
[39:06] you know the top of Bitcoin well Bitcoin
[39:08] doesn't care it just does what what it
[39:10] does um so the the threat I um and I'm
[39:15] not I'm not saying this kind of to be
[39:17] irresponsible to say there's no threat
[39:18] of course any system can be attacked
[39:21] somehow but as long as the code itself
[39:24] is intact um I don't see a real track
[39:28] there's a track to adoption would say
[39:30] track to
[39:32] adoption countries can governments can
[39:35] ban it B use possession um transaction
[39:39] over borders nationally there's a many
[39:43] ways that um adoption can be slowed down
[39:47] so uh but ultimately I think it's
[39:51] inevitable because uh people will find a
[39:54] way to to heal those wounds for
[39:57] themselves and their families and they
[39:59] will be willing to even relocate to move
[40:02] on to the standard under which they're
[40:05] not bleeding at a rate of where that
[40:08] jurisdiction is asking them to bleed
[40:12] so so I don't see a threat to the code
[40:15] let's say um but I see the always threat
[40:20] to uh you know the rate of adoption
[40:23] because that's something that can be
[40:24] impacted by by policies
[40:28] and um yeah yeah and uh I totally agree
[40:33] with that I think that you cannot stop
[40:34] Bitcoin you cannot ban Bitcoin you
[40:36] cannot do anything with Bitcoin uh
[40:39] except there like a Black Swan that is
[40:41] just impossible to predict um other than
[40:44] that you can just like slow it down or
[40:47] accelerate I'm obviously trying to
[40:49] accelerate it with a podcast I'm trying
[40:51] to get the signal uh of of Bitcoin out
[40:54] there um others try to uh um slow it
[40:58] down and but I think even with people
[41:01] trying to slowing it down uh they are
[41:04] weirdly enhancing it if if you see the
[41:07] countries that try to adopt Bitcoin all
[41:09] of the sudden the interest in Bitcoin uh
[41:13] rises in that country so even if you P
[41:16] like I have this U example I brought up
[41:20] I think two one or two times in my
[41:22] podcast uh um a professor in a
[41:25] university close to me uh teached about
[41:29] uh a certain topic that was not related
[41:32] to bitcoin at all but he always uses the
[41:35] first 10 to 15 minutes to on
[41:39] bitcoin ah wow and I was sitting on in
[41:41] that lecture and it not it didn't not
[41:43] even has to do something with with
[41:45] economics it was a technical course
[41:48] about uh uh um cyber security so it's
[41:53] like what has this to do with Bitcoin of
[41:55] course it's a blockchain and blockchain
[41:57] is a tech technology you can use but
[42:00] cyber secur it has nothing to do really
[42:03] with with Bitcoin itself uh and it's an
[42:06] introduction course and so and he used
[42:09] this first 50 minutes to say like f
[42:12] about the environment impact about how
[42:15] it's bad to have a money with an
[42:17] indestructable Ledger uh and I'm sitting
[42:20] there and I'm like he's doing a really
[42:23] good advertisement for Bitcoin because
[42:26] there are uh 500 students in there in
[42:28] the room that all of the sudden think hm
[42:32] what's Bitcoin actually why is he
[42:34] talking now about
[42:36] Bitcoin so even even if you ha it if you
[42:39] say bad stuff about Bitcoin there's one
[42:43] guy in there that for the first time
[42:45] ever asked himself what is bitcoin went
[42:47] home researched about Bitcoin and this
[42:50] was like oh interesting that is
[42:53] something and then in this lecture
[42:55] probably one Bitcoin Maxi was born
[42:58] but
[42:59] 499 probably bought that narrative
[43:02] that's also uh yes they bought maybe the
[43:06] narrative but it does not matter because
[43:09] the people that bought the narrative are
[43:11] people that are not critical thinking
[43:13] anyways so for them the chance to get
[43:16] Bitcoin is is slow and they will get it
[43:19] uh and Bitcoin is then in their minds
[43:22] that they have a bad uh narrative in
[43:25] their head about Bitcoin this is bad but
[43:28] they have Bitcoin in their head and this
[43:30] is the crucial part when Bitcoin then
[43:33] rises again in to to higher numbers
[43:36] they're like oh I heard about
[43:39] Bitcoin a year ago now it's it's rising
[43:42] up again now it's scratching down like
[43:45] Bitcoin can only lose if nobody talks
[43:48] about it and nobody uses it and nobody
[43:50] does anything as long as people keep um
[43:54] keep it in the loop and talk about it
[43:56] and have such a great incentive to talk
[43:58] about it the haters want to talk about
[44:00] it because gets gets attention uh people
[44:03] also want to talk about it because it's
[44:04] such a great
[44:05] technology um so as long as it's in the
[44:09] loop it will win the the worst thing
[44:12] that can happen to bitcoin that nobody
[44:14] cares about it and everybody drops it
[44:16] and then it's like ah I don't want it
[44:18] anymore which I don't think will happen
[44:20] in any like at all like this is a
[44:24] scenario where I'm like I cannot see
[44:26] foresee that yeah
[44:28] I think it's it's great that Bitcoin is
[44:30] in the loop as you said it's it's great
[44:32] because I want Bitcoin to be challenged
[44:35] in these early years so we don't adopt
[44:37] something that's going to fail in 50
[44:39] years so then we have a bigger problem
[44:41] than than now then um so these are the
[44:46] years um where Bitcoin should be
[44:48] challenged and people it's normal that
[44:51] people had this opinion on bitcoin um it
[44:56] just normal and it should be challenged
[44:58] and I think that of course breeds the
[45:00] antifragility of Bitcoin and it should
[45:02] be antifragile to become even better as
[45:06] a result of attack uh because it
[45:09] strengthens its narrative by being
[45:11] attack that it's stronger than the
[45:14] narrative
[45:15] yeah so I I I welcome that it just we're
[45:19] losing time but okay you know that's
[45:21] also inevitable that's that's the way
[45:24] humans are we and and until
[45:27] it's super obvious we will challenge it
[45:29] and then we will accept it uh because we
[45:32] have to I guess test it for ourselves
[45:36] um I guess to not accept something we we
[45:40] are resistant to change so
[45:43] inherently so
[45:46] um yeah I think it's a it's a good thing
[45:49] that it uh it's in the loop of course I
[45:52] don't like hearing negative uh things in
[45:55] that sense as that professor was doing
[45:57] because it simply delays delays the
[45:59] adoption if that if he came to that
[46:03] lecture and said to 500 people you know
[46:07] students uh today I learned something
[46:10] meaningful and I would like you to kind
[46:14] of maybe to get you curious about that's
[46:16] a much better thing to do even if he
[46:19] came to the to um to the class and said
[46:23] I found something I don't know what it
[46:27] what it is let us all together see what
[46:30] it is and then maybe we can judge but
[46:33] not to come in and be um you know
[46:35] negative from beginning um again that
[46:39] just delays adoption this does doesn't
[46:42] do anything to bitcoin itself so yeah
[46:46] yeah definitely what's your current uh
[46:49] take on on the Bitcoin ETF now we are a
[46:51] few weeks I think no even like months
[46:55] into the journey uh uh what did you
[46:57] thought before what did you think now
[46:59] after Bitcoins what will they do in the
[47:01] next one one two years for Bitcoin it's
[47:04] uh it's a tricky one it's a tricky one
[47:08] because Bitcoin ETFs is the touch point
[47:12] of the Fiat world and the Bitcoin world
[47:14] at a large
[47:16] scale Bitcoin ETFs are the way for Wall
[47:20] Street touch the Bitcoin World Bitcoin
[47:23] ETFs are still just a clay name on
[47:27] bitcoin there's no sell custody there so
[47:31] at this point it's early to to judge its
[47:34] full effect I I said even in that
[47:38] article it's
[47:41] um it's obvious that ETFs will affect
[47:44] the price positively it's simple as that
[47:46] because there's a wall of money from
[47:47] Wall Street coming um into the into
[47:51] Bitcoin ETFs and I have no doubt that
[47:53] price will rise as long as the ETF
[47:55] narrative is support orted by the the
[47:57] biggest institutional investors even
[48:00] though Pension funds coming in and um
[48:03] but I I want us to be the English word
[48:06] bury or like not worried but like to be
[48:09] to have like a rational
[48:11] concern where um what actually what's
[48:15] actually happening is that ETFs are
[48:17] buying uh Bitcoin being cost being under
[48:21] custody of um one particular uh
[48:25] jurisdiction
[48:27] where it could be seized with one piece
[48:30] of paper by a government so if that
[48:34] that's a risk for me that it's like a
[48:36] legitimate risk uh because now Bitcoin
[48:39] at lower price let's say was distributed
[48:43] more then it's going to be distributed
[48:45] after the the wall of money comes in
[48:49] into ETFs so centralization of the
[48:52] custody under certain
[48:54] jurisdiction again it it's inevitable
[48:57] that's something we can also not um
[48:59] influence much because on the the way of
[49:02] adoption of Bitcoin AS Global money etc
[49:06] etc uh Bitcoin ETFs the way Fiat World
[49:10] sees Bitcoin World it it was meant to
[49:13] happen that that link that claim on
[49:15] something that is stored somewhere else
[49:18] because the whole field world is is the
[49:20] world of transacting
[49:22] claims um we don't transact actually
[49:26] anything in the F world we transact
[49:28] claims we don't know uh that's why the
[49:31] Bitcoin is the first uh maybe only asset
[49:35] in the world that you can truly own in
[49:37] your head you don't have to own it
[49:40] physically um and that's really hard for
[49:42] the Fiat world to grasp so Bitcoin ETFs
[49:47] I'm I I say I'm neutral I was a bit
[49:50] negative about at the beginning because
[49:53] that's when I wrote the adversarial
[49:55] hling um the troan horse um of the
[49:59] Bitcoin world centralization of Bitcoins
[50:02] in a certain
[50:05] jurisdiction uh because I understand
[50:09] Bitcoin ETFs are are the alternative to
[50:13] self- custody especially for now us
[50:14] customers etc etc and it's going to
[50:17] bring the price up and it's going to the
[50:19] price going up will uh increase interest
[50:23] in Bitcoin because numbers go up
[50:25] technology ET Etc but I just invite um
[50:31] you know
[50:32] um a reasonable skepticism from the
[50:36] Bitcoin standpoint I'm not saying it's
[50:38] bad or good I said I'm neutral but to
[50:41] give it time and
[50:44] um yeah to to see how how how things go
[50:48] uh I'm I'm still whenever possible
[50:51] advocating for for self- custody that's
[50:53] where the power of Bitcoin lies the
[50:55] ability to access the layer one whenever
[50:57] you want transact value through space
[50:59] and time that's where the the power of
[51:03] uh Bitcoin itself is is
[51:06] fully
[51:08] manifested manifested um because if
[51:11] you're just uh in in for the Bitcoin
[51:14] price great I mean I respect that no
[51:18] problem but um to fully unlock the
[51:23] potential of Bitcoin you I advocate for
[51:25] for selfcast I I know it's it's
[51:27] impossible in some cases
[51:29] but I I hope I think it's ultimately
[51:33] it's not that hard to sell custody um
[51:37] but you need to understand why you're
[51:38] doing so um that you're not interest
[51:41] just for the price you're in for if
[51:44] something overnight happens with the
[51:45] Fiat world you're you're good you don't
[51:48] there's no to sell a Bitcoin ETF it's
[51:51] still a claim you have to go through the
[51:53] through the system um there's
[51:57] censorship involved um in in that in you
[52:01] know buying selling Bitcoin ETF
[52:05] so direct access is through self custody
[52:08] to bitcoin so
[52:12] again it is what it is um I'm neutral um
[52:16] it's yet to be seen the full effect of
[52:19] Bitcoin ETFs they will for sure increase
[52:21] the price of of Bitcoin in denominated
[52:24] in fiat currency simply because of this
[52:27] wall of money coming in for the number
[52:30] go up
[52:31] technology I think people are not buying
[52:34] ETFs to feel their own Bitcoin somehow
[52:37] they own the
[52:38] exposure to the price uh increase over
[52:42] time that's what they're
[52:44] mind so I would I mean I think I that
[52:48] that article that I wrote I I still
[52:51] stand behind it um it's it's a good uh a
[52:55] little warning signal signal to the
[52:57] world why this could end up bad but
[53:00] again feel free to uh use Bitcoin ETFs
[53:05] for all the good say aspects but always
[53:08] be a bit
[53:10] um cautious of what you're actually
[53:12] buying as anything in the Fiat world you
[53:14] buy a claim and then the claim somehow
[53:17] is said not to be worth anything uh
[53:21] which can happen to Fiat money as well I
[53:22] mean anything anything in the fat world
[53:25] I'm always uh fascinating how bitcoiners
[53:28] are diving deep into topics as you do
[53:31] deep in in different topics and you also
[53:33] wrote about about stuff on on on on
[53:35] medium and uh what are you currently
[53:39] watching or reading or learning about
[53:42] like is there some current Topic in
[53:44] Bitcoin or even outside of Bitcoin uh
[53:48] what are you currently uh investigating
[53:50] learning about going deep on
[53:53] that it's a good question I I I actually
[53:55] started watching series of Michael
[53:58] sailor and Robert breed recently it's a
[54:02] beautiful series of um of conversations
[54:05] I think it happened in the
[54:07] pandemic um when they just sat down on
[54:10] zoom and discussed for
[54:12] hours uh the history of money
[54:15] philosophy and U they they had time to
[54:18] step back and look into Bitcoin from an
[54:21] amazing perspective talk about Roman
[54:23] Empire and I learned so much from from
[54:25] that
[54:27] um I also saw there is a great course
[54:30] that I want to enroll in on sail.org
[54:32] where I did the austan school of
[54:34] Economics course I think level one but
[54:36] there other levels as well um and I'm
[54:40] just uh enjoying our telegram group
[54:43] where we talk about a bit of sometimes
[54:45] nonsense and a lot of sense uh but it's
[54:48] fun to be there X spaces are now
[54:51] becoming um interesting area also to to
[54:54] be part of X is
[54:57] actually one of the last kind of
[55:02] mainstream truth
[55:04] forums
[55:06] available where you can actually talk
[55:08] about the base layer of Truth as such
[55:12] and not being censored so that's the I
[55:16] know there is a no nost as well I'm
[55:18] fortunately not yet part of it
[55:22] um so yeah and honestly I was just uh
[55:26] going through the Bitcoin standard book
[55:28] I I go from time to time and I think
[55:29] that's the book I want to reread for the
[55:31] who knows fourth time
[55:35] um yeah so these are these are kind of
[55:39] um Bitcoin is such and low time
[55:42] preference also led me to a lot of uh
[55:45] topics of personal development from
[55:47] exercising
[55:49] nutrition um so it extended my interests
[55:53] because now that you can save in in
[55:56] Bitcoin and and hope to live long enough
[55:59] to to preserve the value of your
[56:02] earnings um you lower your time
[56:04] preference and then you can get
[56:05] interested in other subjects and study
[56:10] you know how you can make your life
[56:11] better in many other areas not just
[56:13] Bitcoin um but yeah in terms of
[56:17] Bitcoin um it's always good to study
[56:20] further
[56:22] Austrian um School of Economics uh
[56:25] economies
[56:27] um because that that's where the I guess
[56:30] that the truth based layer lies of how
[56:35] um economics works and what economics is
[56:38] if you're people interested in in that
[56:40] human behavior how we transact why we
[56:43] transact um and what are those uh
[56:47] laws conditionally speaking um of human
[56:51] behavior
[56:53] um so
[56:55] yeah yeah kind these areas yeah and and
[56:59] we can always it's fascinating for me
[57:01] because I'm now yeah four years around
[57:04] that time uh in Bitcoin and every year I
[57:08] learn something new with every podcast
[57:11] guest actually learned some some new
[57:13] aspect of it A New Perspective a new
[57:16] phase of it a new technical stuff a new
[57:19] whatever like there's always something
[57:21] new in there and it's fascinating for me
[57:24] to to to learn so much about this great
[57:27] technology and do being able to document
[57:29] the the life of it and the adoption of
[57:32] it yeah and we having an an end routine
[57:35] in the in the podcast where the previous
[57:37] guest is asking a question for for the
[57:40] next guest uh and it's an interesting
[57:43] one
[57:44] and did not touch on that too much how
[57:48] do you see Bitcoin Bitcoin as payment
[57:52] Network Bitcoin as a payment uh um
[57:55] option
[57:56] going over the next years the adoption
[57:59] of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and
[58:01] unit of
[58:03] account I also think that's inevitable
[58:05] as part of the the Bitcoin Journey um
[58:08] that's going to be Layer Two lightning
[58:10] Network or whatever version of lightning
[58:13] Network I tested lighting Network
[58:16] several times and of course it's instant
[58:18] compared to traditional ways of
[58:22] transacting
[58:24] um I think yeah is going to be coupled
[58:27] with the store of wealth uh component of
[58:30] Bitcoin being layer one and then in
[58:32] Layer Two we will be able to have these
[58:35] wallets where we transact really fast
[58:38] other day I was uh driving in riding in
[58:40] a taxi with a friend and um we paid um
[58:45] Taxi by
[58:46] card debit card let's say and that
[58:49] transaction took 14 seconds let's say
[58:53] which is fair and I I know that that
[58:56] transaction can take one second let's
[58:58] say if it was
[59:01] um a lighting transaction so I told my
[59:04] friend you know this is why the Bitcoin
[59:07] transactions will win because they solve
[59:10] this 13c problem this Taxi Driver 13
[59:13] seconds times how many payments per day
[59:15] 13 um times how many days he works
[59:18] through career maybe doesn't add much
[59:21] but it's enough to incentivize us as a
[59:24] whole to even subconsciously seek better
[59:27] Solutions not to mention fees that's
[59:29] other story fees are also lower um but
[59:33] time we don't want to waste time on this
[59:35] planet Earth so uh people will naturally
[59:39] gravitate towards these solutions that
[59:42] uh are simply better and I think Bitcoin
[59:45] payments will definitely be reality at a
[59:47] much larger scale that they are now
[59:49] simply because they solve this problem
[59:52] they're faster easier
[59:55] um yeah so but we should also
[59:57] acknowledge that the Fiat world did
[60:00] really its best to simplify payments so
[60:04] the transition to to to uh sound money
[60:06] and and Bitcoin is kind of more
[60:09] blurry um so they made it easy
[60:13] relatively easy it's 14 seconds it's not
[60:15] one but it's not 5 minutes so they
[60:18] narrow this Gap and that that what makes
[60:22] uh um you know the move onto lightning
[60:25] or or or Bitcoin Stander or this way of
[60:28] thinking a little bit not harder but it
[60:30] can take time for people to to
[60:32] collectively lose enough time to to want
[60:35] to move onto this payment
[60:37] Network I I'm deeply convinced that all
[60:40] those networks like Mas card and Visa
[60:43] are at some point forced to either die
[60:46] or adopt
[60:48] Bitcoin it will be interesting to see um
[60:52] thank you Marco for being on it was a
[60:54] pleasure talking with you uh it's it's
[60:56] absolute pleasure to talk everyday
