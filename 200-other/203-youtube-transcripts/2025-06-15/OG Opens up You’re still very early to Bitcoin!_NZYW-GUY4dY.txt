--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] it's uh pretty obvious what Bitcoin is
[00:02] made for and I I doubt that the creators
[00:04] or the Creator saw all this coming you
[00:07] saw Bitcoin as a savings technology
[00:10] internet was kind of made for Bitcoin
[00:11] you think you're late but you're
[00:13] actually so so early lightning is such a
[00:15] good example because it makes dealing
[00:17] with Bitcoin or satosi so easy and quick
[00:19] attack vectors on bitcoin are
[00:21] interesting because uh I have the
[00:23] impression that nobody really loves to
[00:24] talk about it too much
[00:30] um and you said something that struck me
[00:32] you said like even in the beginning when
[00:34] you first got into Bitcoin uh you saw
[00:37] Bitcoin as a savings technology uh and
[00:40] also like I think the the group members
[00:42] were like oh wow that's like pretty soon
[00:44] you realize that's a savings technology
[00:46] why was this so so uh recognizable for
[00:49] you well I I said it uh off the top of
[00:52] my head back then and I thought about
[00:55] why uh and how did I actually get into
[00:57] it because it is quite a long time ago
[01:00] in in Bitcoin uh
[01:03] time uh it was like
[01:06] 2013 and uh my initial idea was that I
[01:11] didn't want to miss out on yet another
[01:13] tech wve because I had missed out uh
[01:16] investing into the rise of the personal
[01:19] computer I had missed out investing into
[01:22] uh the rise of Microsoft and then later
[01:24] had missed out also on the rise of the
[01:27] internet on the smartphone and
[01:28] everything else
[01:30] so um and I always wanted to to to find
[01:33] a a good investment to take care of
[01:36] myself and the
[01:37] family and uh so my initial idea uh
[01:43] was I uh I recognized the uh that
[01:46] Bitcoin was something new that had not
[01:49] been there before so my initial idea was
[01:51] was as an uh as a as a as an investment
[01:54] in yet another high-tech product which
[01:57] is only possible today and which was not
[01:59] possible
[02:00] earlier and then later on I I dove into
[02:03] the rabbit hole and and found uh new
[02:05] thoughts and and uh the that was the the
[02:08] thought I told you about uh savings
[02:10] technology was only a couple years later
[02:13] on oh I I love it but it's I think it's
[02:16] great to to see it um you also said like
[02:19] right now with with the not yet another
[02:23] uh adoption wave um you lived through
[02:26] the internet adoption life 1990 2000s uh
[02:29] and had yesterday on Steve with he's
[02:31] like 75 year old and and we really went
[02:34] deep into like how he was in Internet
[02:37] adoption he was a network engineer even
[02:39] in that time uh how did you live through
[02:42] the internet adoption and interesting
[02:45] how can you connect like internet and
[02:48] Bitcoin to
[02:49] it oh well uh back then I was just a
[02:52] user I was not any a coder in any way I
[02:55] am still a user so I do not do any uh
[02:58] coding or Hardware design I use uh the
[03:01] internet for for my work which is
[03:03] technical uh drawing technical designing
[03:05] steel
[03:06] detailing and for for private stuff and
[03:09] uh back then I I uh lived through the
[03:12] internet adoption as a user and so I
[03:15] grew along with it and I went through
[03:16] all the early stuff the Netscape brows
[03:20] and all that and uh dial in mods and the
[03:24] old stuff from the 1990s like everybody
[03:27] else and um
[03:31] concerning Bitcoin I had an interesting
[03:34] idea that came to me uh couple months
[03:36] ago that uh when you look at the
[03:39] technical specification of the Bitcoin
[03:42] core it has a certain uh bandwidth
[03:45] requirement for the internet um in order
[03:48] to work at all so it can make
[03:50] connections to the to the to the network
[03:53] and uh the uh internet bandwidth is um
[03:57] like rising or doubling every 10 years
[03:59] or so it's like growing
[04:01] exponentially and back then when when
[04:04] Bitcoin was
[04:06] incepted uh it's matched uh the global
[04:09] available average bandwidth pretty
[04:12] perfectly so the Bitcoin core the the
[04:14] the year came out at about 2010 matched
[04:17] the available internet bandwidth so
[04:20] that's uh so that makes me think today
[04:22] that the internet was kind of made for
[04:24] Bitcoin of
[04:25] course and wait and this internet
[04:28] bandwith it's still every 10 years uh
[04:31] well it's going to it's it's I think
[04:33] it's going to I'm I'm not technical
[04:35] expert but it did so in the past okay
[04:39] and uh I don't know how long this is
[04:41] going going to go on it depends on
[04:44] technical developments I have no part in
[04:46] but um but that's pretty interesting
[04:48] it's become pretty quick by by now when
[04:50] when you think back to the olden days of
[04:51] streaming things wen't possible where
[04:53] lagging today you can stream every movie
[04:55] in high quality for example and you even
[04:58] can download mve in like depending on
[05:01] your internet connection like a few
[05:02] seconds or a few minutes and then you
[05:04] have it offline even and you don't even
[05:05] have to stream it it's pretty amazing
[05:07] actually remember those days where I
[05:09] have to download like a movie or a game
[05:11] or something like that and I have to
[05:12] wait like a day I it's like click half
[05:16] an hour maximum and it's it is there yes
[05:19] it's become so quick amazingly quick um
[05:22] where would you say um are we now with
[05:24] Bitcoin adoption especially when you
[05:26] maybe compare it because internet
[05:28] adoption is like people have it in the
[05:29] with 2000 with the bubble uh then like
[05:32] there's Google uh and all the things are
[05:35] coming they were there before where like
[05:37] if you had to put a year from the
[05:39] internet adoption to the Bitcoin
[05:40] adoption now where would you say we are
[05:42] like 1995
[05:44] 97 well that
[05:47] that's that's difficult to say because
[05:50] uh Bitcoin is a
[05:52] Grassroots
[05:54] thing and
[05:56] um the many other adoption Cycles like
[06:00] uh the computer or the smartphone phone
[06:02] they were driven by by large companies
[06:05] and centralized uh big
[06:09] money
[06:10] um but it's safe to say we are still
[06:14] pretty early because uh many people have
[06:17] heard of Bitcoin but uh not a lot uh
[06:20] know a lot about
[06:22] it and there's a a lot of stuff
[06:25] happening as I saw on the BTC prog there
[06:26] lots of companies building hardware and
[06:28] software around this amazing thing it's
[06:30] beautiful and um I I can't pinpoint uh
[06:35] at what year compared to any other uh
[06:39] adoption we are
[06:40] but I think
[06:43] um maybe if you compare it to the
[06:46] internet uh
[06:48] development I'd
[06:50] say early to mid 1990s maybe yeah like
[06:54] 1994 or something like
[06:57] that 1994
[07:01] I think it's really funny because I
[07:03] always thought about like Bitcoin is
[07:05] more to the 2000s but everyone that I uh
[07:09] ask tells me something before
[07:12] 1998 like I always like oh maybe it's
[07:14] like closer to 1997 1998 um before we
[07:18] got a huge boom into the Doom bubble and
[07:20] stuff like that but everyone is actually
[07:23] more like oh no no no we not that far in
[07:25] the Bitcoin conversation uh yesterday or
[07:28] day before yesterday I heard we are
[07:30] right around the
[07:31] 1990s we really early with with Bitcoin
[07:35] uh because even the tcpip protocol was
[07:37] like the layer three and like if you
[07:39] have Bitcoin as the base layer we we
[07:41] cannot even imagine what like will
[07:42] happen on like third layer fourth layer
[07:45] we are going in the future and we still
[07:47] figuring out uh the the base layer now
[07:50] uh which is pretty pretty soon it's it's
[07:53] spectacular for me when you're like you
[07:55] you think you're early and you think
[07:56] you're late but you're actually so so
[07:58] early and in in Bitcoin well yes when
[08:02] you're in for a long time it it feels
[08:04] kind of
[08:05] late because you everybody knows the
[08:08] crazy moves uh Bitcoin did in in the
[08:10] early days and um yeah it's
[08:15] um uh it's it's super exciting so uh
[08:19] early and late at the same time but uh
[08:21] maybe it's it's never too late to to get
[08:24] into the layer zero I think the time is
[08:26] always good to get in
[08:28] there um um because the potential of of
[08:32] Bitcoin is so great it gives me new new
[08:34] ideas every day like today uh now we're
[08:37] in vien and I had to uh to um get some
[08:40] cash at the ATM machine I had to get me
[08:42] a ticket for the local Subway and I went
[08:46] to buy me a bottle of water and
[08:48] everywhere you have a different uh card
[08:51] or you have to pay in cash you have to
[08:52] pay in card then you and and and and
[08:55] there's lots of different cards and and
[08:57] different companies uh want to to
[09:00] partake in this business and uh if you
[09:02] had one standard like Bitcoin it would
[09:04] be a lot easier you you would still have
[09:06] a lot of different apps like the wallet
[09:09] apps you have uh but um I think it would
[09:13] be would make life a lot
[09:15] easier one protocol the rule and mod
[09:18] basically and it's really interesting
[09:19] also for me uh when we talk about all
[09:22] those different cars when when we think
[09:24] about like spending digital Euros uh
[09:27] every time we transact with it there's
[09:29] like like a massive fee to it like the
[09:31] master cat takes massive Fe all all the
[09:33] things not as a end consumer but uh as
[09:38] as a business and everything uh so I
[09:40] think I hope like uh buying an apple
[09:43] should not have like a 3% fee on on on
[09:46] there should like be really really slow
[09:48] and maybe then the bigger transactions
[09:50] later that we settle on bitcoin sellling
[09:53] on on on Lightning uh those should be
[09:55] like a smaller
[09:57] one oh well the the fees I think they
[10:00] are here to stay because if you if you
[10:02] build a business around Bitcoin you you
[10:03] have to live of something and if it's
[10:06] Satoshi fee uh so be it it's only fair
[10:10] but um it's going to depend on how high
[10:12] the fees are if they are like sensible
[10:14] and low it's it's going to be cool that
[10:17] that there's not going to be like a
[10:18] feess transaction nobody's going to
[10:20] build a business around something they
[10:22] cannot take uh any any fees from um but
[10:26] I had an amazing in uh experience with
[10:28] uh with uh paying with sets in a bar in
[10:31] Prague and it happened really lightning
[10:33] quick as the network name says it was
[10:36] was was so felt so amazing uh just
[10:39] flashing quick and a little bit of a fee
[10:41] and and that would be so nice to have do
[10:44] you think the uh or do you already see
[10:47] the the Bitcoin adoption going with like
[10:49] lightning maybe fedman where do you see
[10:52] like this the scaling happening or can
[10:54] we even see it now oh I see it happening
[10:58] it's this uh like lightning is such a
[11:00] good example because it makes uh uh
[11:02] dealing with Bitcoin or Satoshi so easy
[11:05] and
[11:06] quick uh when I went to that bar I I
[11:08] bought me a beer and I it was my first
[11:12] Satoshi transaction for for something
[11:15] for consum consumable so I think it was
[11:17] a great idea to buy chze beer with
[11:20] Satoshi it was absolutely beautiful
[11:22] worth it and uh the the bartender said
[11:26] sure they handed me his uh P his tablet
[11:28] with a QR code I scanned it and that was
[11:31] it it happened like within a
[11:33] second and that's uh that's that's
[11:36] clearly adoption because it it it takes
[11:39] uh place on a on a higher level protocol
[11:43] which is so much quicker and I still
[11:46] have to get into the fatty Mint or the
[11:48] the Noster and all the other stuff I saw
[11:50] on the BTC prog I have not found time
[11:52] yet to get to dive into this stuff
[11:54] that's happening there so there's a lot
[11:57] stuff happening that's very very
[11:59] interesting like fedman is super
[12:01] interesting for communal use of of
[12:04] Bitcoin that's super cool and uh but I
[12:07] have to dive into it yet yeah and it's
[12:10] also interesting for me to see where the
[12:12] Bitcoin adoption uh is taking place and
[12:15] how long it will take to hit certain
[12:17] mileston like we have now like the first
[12:19] Bitcoin transaction was the Bitcoin
[12:21] Pizza day uh it it's like a wild back it
[12:23] was like 2010 I think uh it was like it
[12:26] was really early on in in the in the
[12:28] internet day
[12:29] yes uh now not quite true when it was
[12:33] but it was pretty early when it was
[12:34] 10,000 uh Bitcoin for one p yeah that
[12:38] was that's really early like 10,000
[12:41] Bitcoin uh imagine holding on to them
[12:43] since
[12:45] then but yeah uh this this this thing uh
[12:49] of having uh Bitcoin payments uh right
[12:53] now it's possible we have some
[12:55] applications um some bitcoiners use it
[12:57] at like Bitcoin conference
[12:59] they they maybe ask like the local bar
[13:01] or or restaurant if they accept it some
[13:04] pay maybe even weekly or monthly with it
[13:07] um maybe some are in El Salvador and
[13:09] those places who actually pay almost
[13:11] everything with it so we depending on
[13:14] where you live and and what you do with
[13:16] it um you have a different uh view on
[13:20] where Bitcoin as a medium of exchange as
[13:23] a currency is um when do you think I
[13:27] mean it's pure speculation but it's
[13:29] still fun to talk about it when do you
[13:31] think we hit this this Milestone where
[13:33] we it's it's kind of normal we have
[13:35] Bitcoin as a currency also you mean in
[13:38] the future when we're going to hit the
[13:39] mil in the future
[13:43] yeah oh that's a difficult one it's um
[13:47] it
[13:47] it depends on so many things on on the
[13:51] will of of people in general to accept
[13:55] it and the will of businesses and uh
[13:59] that depends on the government
[14:01] regulations you have so it's going to be
[14:05] different by country the the quicker uh
[14:07] a country is uh giving Bitcoin a proper
[14:11] legal status and being supportive of it
[14:14] is going to make the difference that's
[14:17] my opinion yeah it's and the people will
[14:20] follow when when the when the
[14:22] regulations are there or they will go
[14:23] first and the regulations will have to
[14:25] follow one way or the other it's both
[14:27] happening so there some countries where
[14:30] the people are very Pro Bitcoin and
[14:31] regulations is lagging behind and you
[14:34] have to kind of force it into the
[14:35] government or talk uh to the government
[14:38] the government will see that that PE
[14:40] Bitcoin people are like way smarter and
[14:43] uh than average or have maybe
[14:47] better better attitude and and more
[14:50] serious attitude and uh that helps uh
[14:54] government adapt or get the foot into
[14:56] the door of the government or you have
[14:58] it the other way around sound like uh
[15:00] like in El Salvador when when the
[15:01] president does the first step and so
[15:04] it's it's going to happen different
[15:07] speeds in different parts of the world I
[15:10] also think so I mean we already see it
[15:12] where there are almost no transactions
[15:14] in in some countries and a lot of
[15:15] transactions in some others like
[15:17] Salvador Nigeria uh already a lot of
[15:20] Grassroots movements coming also an
[15:22] interesting question to that uh you
[15:24] mentioned before Bitcoin is a Grassroots
[15:26] movement um and uh this is like I love I
[15:30] love that that Bitcoin actually comes up
[15:33] from from uh from small like we call it
[15:36] plaps uh and and the and then they drive
[15:39] Bitcoin adoption uh but now more and
[15:41] more like starting with 2020 we had
[15:43] micro strategy now more and more public
[15:45] company coming in even Salvador with it
[15:49] was like a top down thing now we have
[15:51] the Bitcoin ETF and all this
[15:52] institutional money coming in um two
[15:55] things that are really interesting for
[15:56] me like first of all like how different
[15:58] is Bitcoin Community now to when in the
[16:01] early days when you were around uh and
[16:03] the second one is like is it is it still
[16:06] like a crass Ro movement or is it like
[16:09] becoming more and more institutionalized
[16:11] more and more as a top town that people
[16:13] kind of like have to take it because uh
[16:16] the the the the asset managers put it in
[16:19] every font and you and when you invest
[16:21] in S&P 500 you have it uh well back in
[16:24] the day uh the um I I uh was not part of
[16:30] any uh Bitcoin Community I was aware
[16:33] that
[16:34] um in 2013 when I was new to bitcoin it
[16:38] was uh in the public opinion only used
[16:42] by drug dealers on uh Sil Road or
[16:47] gamblers or nerd money so there was a
[16:51] community of of hackers and deaths like
[16:54] on GitHub or wherever those guys uh are
[16:59] but I never was a part of that because I
[17:01] don't do any software development so I
[17:03] was pretty much on my on my
[17:06] own and
[17:08] um and then I I I uh I went into Bitcoin
[17:14] and uh and held on to to most of it made
[17:21] a couple mistakes during investing and
[17:24] um well to today what was the question
[17:26] again where where the where was this
[17:29] going yeah for EXA especially when you
[17:31] have the comparison from now to then uh
[17:34] back then as you said it was just like
[17:36] hackers or maybe some some Finance nerds
[17:40] that actually paid attention uh or
[17:43] people in the cryptographic community
[17:45] like oh that's interesting PP
[17:47] transactions and and Bitcoin but now you
[17:49] have Micro strategy you have the Bitcoin
[17:51] ETFs you have all those those really big
[17:54] wallets in there uh and I'm just
[17:57] wondering now there's like
[17:59] even like when we have for example the
[18:01] S&P 500 everyone that's invested in the
[18:04] S&P 500 has some exposure to bitcoin
[18:07] because Tesla has Bitcoin and micro
[18:09] strategy might also be soon in the S&P
[18:11] 500 and then like everyone has indirect
[18:13] access to the Bitcoin uh with ETFs it
[18:17] might come in Pension funds it might
[18:19] come in other in other products so it
[18:21] might actually be that someone really
[18:24] hates Bitcoin but they still have it
[18:27] because they have some ETF or some some
[18:30] f investing and it kind of comes STP
[18:33] town from from the things yes yes it's
[18:36] uh it's in the beginning it was it was
[18:38] Grassroots like completely bottom up
[18:39] before there were any companies
[18:41] investing of course it was just uh you
[18:43] and holding on to a Bitcoin and your
[18:45] diamond hands or lus hands whatever you
[18:47] had and the other uh coins around and it
[18:50] was uh yeah it it was a gamble it was a
[18:52] wild west thing and uh with the
[18:55] Inception of if the ETF uh that was
[18:59] or maybe even earlier it became pretty
[19:02] obvious that uh Bitcoin was becoming
[19:05] interested for uh for governments and en
[19:08] large money uh of
[19:11] Corporations um but it still has its
[19:15] Grassroots element because all those uh
[19:18] uh companies I saw on uh on the BTC prag
[19:22] they are obviously uh existing because
[19:26] of Bitcoin and are
[19:29] small new founded companies growing uh
[19:33] young people very spirited very creative
[19:37] very positive so all the uh landmarks of
[19:40] of uh uh growing healthy young companies
[19:44] and that's Grassroots to me because it's
[19:47] uh it's not maybe they have some
[19:49] sponsors or or or business bigger ideas
[19:52] but you never know but I I met a lot of
[19:55] uh of Highly spirited people like the
[19:58] guys from Road town with the pirate ship
[19:59] that was beautiful and it's yeah it's uh
[20:03] it's such a that's such a positive
[20:05] Grassroots feeling that come came to me
[20:07] on that BTC prag and on the other hand
[20:10] um it's yeah it's uh you I think it's a
[20:15] positive thing that uh big money and and
[20:18] and and and governments are becoming
[20:21] aware of it because you need to have the
[20:23] environment the legal
[20:24] environment uh to to build a Bitcoin
[20:28] economy
[20:29] you you need to have the taxes and the
[20:31] regulations and and to order to to sort
[20:35] that out you need to have some kind of
[20:38] government and uh the big money
[20:41] investing into um Bitcoin is troubling
[20:45] me a bit sometimes like if you think
[20:47] about black rock or other big funds
[20:50] because they could of course uh use
[20:53] their stack to try and uh manipulate the
[20:57] market like they do with everything else
[20:59] like gold or what have you it's all
[21:01] manipulated it's all uh part of this
[21:03] game
[21:05] and uh with Bitcoin it's there are so
[21:08] many theories out there that Bitcoin
[21:09] will always win no matter how I I mean
[21:12] like uh uh like a company with a big
[21:15] stack of Bitcoin and malicious um
[21:18] purpose could uh do a large dump and
[21:21] um you could play out a lot of theories
[21:24] what would happen then it would the
[21:25] Bitcoin would flow to to people like
[21:27] Michael sailor have a good attitude and
[21:31] uh stack it for like a future purpose
[21:34] nobody knows maybe to release it on on
[21:37] uh upon the world on on a day in the
[21:40] future in order to so for everybody to
[21:43] benefit so it's uh it's it's very very
[21:47] complex and I cannot foresee what is
[21:49] going to happen in a Bitcoin space or if
[21:52] if Bitcoin can actually be harmed by
[21:54] very rich actors with bad purposes yeah
[21:57] it's I think that's to the topic is in
[22:00] the Bitcoin Community since uh even
[22:02] before the Bitcoin even started like uh
[22:05] I can remember that like a year ago it
[22:07] already started that topic like what if
[22:10] actually Bitcoin EDF happens Black Rock
[22:13] comes in they have a lot of money uh
[22:15] they came really quickly to like 200 or
[22:18] 300,000 Bitcoin all the ETFs together
[22:20] have I think over a million Bitcoin uh
[22:23] to uh accumulated important to note
[22:26] those are not the the compan ETFs
[22:29] companies Bitcoin those are from clients
[22:32] on their behalf but still they control
[22:34] it or rather coinbase controls them uh
[22:37] because they behind them so I see some
[22:40] attack vectors but I'm like over the
[22:43] long run if you have your own Bitcoin
[22:45] you have it in yourself custody solution
[22:47] where nobody can can get them um they
[22:51] can try whatever they want they can
[22:53] manipulate the price of course uh for
[22:55] over the long over the short ter maybe
[22:57] even medium term but long run I feel
[23:00] like uh the the price will swort each
[23:03] other even with the gold price I feel
[23:04] like um the they can can do a lot more
[23:08] with gold but over the long run it still
[23:10] uh will will do its it its thing I mean
[23:12] gold is a not a beast because there's
[23:14] also then uh the thing coming in with uh
[23:17] the the supply of gold like when gold
[23:19] price comes up people will start digging
[23:22] in the oceans and and then try to find
[23:24] more gold and all those things yes yes
[23:27] uh but but attch factors on bitcoin are
[23:29] interesting because uh I have the
[23:31] impression that nobody really loves to
[23:33] talk about it too much and there are
[23:35] indeed a few uh weak points that or
[23:39] possibly weak points that should be
[23:41] addressed more
[23:42] often
[23:44] um yeah the one thing is that that like
[23:47] big uh actors with big money can can
[23:50] they have like you said like a million
[23:51] Bitcoin maybe now and then there's also
[23:54] those uh unmoved uh those long dormant
[23:59] or wallets or lost Keys which also sum
[24:02] up to quite a substantial amount yeah so
[24:07] uh Bitcoin could theoretically inflate
[24:11] so to say in a in a most unfortunate way
[24:14] and somebody tries to strategically uh
[24:18] move or dump his Bitcoin that have been
[24:19] dormant for like um 15 13 years now
[24:24] that's also a
[24:26] possibility um and that uh we bitcoiners
[24:31] or we early bitcoiners or the the
[24:33] community I know now and I saw it at BTC
[24:35] prag and on the internet we are kind of
[24:37] a bubble with a bit of a religious
[24:40] attitude and a bit of nothing uh can
[24:42] happen and and and uh that's you know
[24:46] I'm 50 over 50 years old now and uh
[24:51] something is always something can always
[24:54] happen uh but yes bit Bitcoin is still
[24:56] the best thing to me that that um the
[24:59] best monetary invention at least if not
[25:03] uh if not uh even the dawn of a
[25:06] completely new age potential it is but
[25:10] there will be many rocks in the way with
[25:13] the Bitcoin that might be released and I
[25:16] also thought about that actually when
[25:17] when there's there are definitely a lot
[25:21] of Bitcoin lost over the years that will
[25:23] never be moved again but there also
[25:26] probably someone out there that has a
[25:28] lot of Bitcoin like actually a lot of
[25:30] Bitcoin and never move them because
[25:32] they're like oh no I'm fine I live good
[25:35] like I don't need to move them I don't
[25:36] need to sell them but maybe if Bitcoin
[25:39] gets up to a million he he might be fanc
[25:42] himself and like oh let's let's release
[25:44] I don't know 20,000 Bitcoin today uh
[25:47] because I I would like to have I don't
[25:49] know this this this Villa in in Spain or
[25:51] whatever or like that island with that
[25:54] amount of money um so that's definitely
[25:57] an an attack
[25:58] even if it's maybe strategically like
[26:00] not even uh like I just want to sell my
[26:03] Bitcoin but even like there's some
[26:05] strategic Partners in there that have a
[26:06] lot of Bitcoin but is this attack Vector
[26:09] for you a a danger for uh the long uh
[26:13] the the short medium-term for the price
[26:15] action or might actually be a long-term
[26:19] hurtful thing for
[26:20] Bitcoin no no I don't think it's it's
[26:23] going to it's going to it might hurt the
[26:25] price but that's that's actually not uh
[26:28] what what Bitcoin is all about in the
[26:30] long run So currently the the price
[26:32] action is of
[26:34] course it has to have a connection to
[26:36] Fiat because of the proof of work so and
[26:41] uh in the future it uh I think the
[26:43] monetary aspect will will become less uh
[26:47] uh when the the time chain aspect
[26:49] becomes more uh obvious and that uh that
[26:53] the the the blockchain is um the safest
[26:56] way we will have in the future to store
[26:58] hashes and to uh to
[27:02] trust and that will become I think a a
[27:05] big aspect of of the Bitcoin of the
[27:08] blockchain in the future as a as a as a
[27:10] method to to uh
[27:13] store uh to safely store or witness
[27:15] important events whatever you may have
[27:18] there will be companies around
[27:19] witnessing like the The Notary offices
[27:23] will which will um inscribe contracts
[27:27] into to the blockchain stuff like that
[27:30] and um then as a Bitcoin holder you will
[27:34] have access to this time chain and you
[27:37] can build businesses around that and it
[27:41] uh it might completely decouple for from
[27:43] money and become money
[27:45] itself which it is so it's uh pretty
[27:49] obvious what what Bitcoin is made for
[27:52] and I I doubt that the creators or the
[27:55] Creator saw all this coming that are
[27:58] many examples of of people building
[28:01] things and developing things and
[28:02] bringing things into the world without
[28:05] having any idea what the world will make
[28:07] of it and it's Bitcoin is such a great
[28:10] Universal tool that you can make
[28:12] everything out of it that you can almost
[28:15] everything that you can possibly think
[28:17] of it's also interesting uh you
[28:20] mentioned time chain because I had
[28:22] recently with the time Ching calendar
[28:25] founder um a podcast and he brought
[28:29] something up to my attention that I
[28:31] never heard before but it's actually
[28:32] true Satoshi like in the white paper
[28:35] there's no one word for blockchain like
[28:38] it's not called once blockchain in the
[28:40] white paper and Satoshi never called it
[28:43] uh blockchain but he called it time
[28:45] chain once in an early uh email or
[28:48] writing of him so I was like
[28:51] what it's not called blockchain where
[28:53] this blockchain coming from uh and time
[28:56] chain and this asp of of
[28:59] timestamping uh certain events or maybe
[29:02] even documents or whatever happens it's
[29:04] it's it's a massive thing in what was it
[29:06] quola uh where the uh election was Pro
[29:11] uh audited by Bitcoin with open
[29:14] timestamps I think it is the technology
[29:16] they used and you can actually go on the
[29:19] quat molan uh uh website and see the uh
[29:24] uh voting ballots and then see the proof
[29:27] that of that document with Bitcoin which
[29:31] is fascinating for me that that's a use
[29:33] case that I think Satoshi Nakamoto
[29:37] probably didn't think about or maybe he
[29:39] did but I don't know if he actually
[29:41] thought about like actually those kind
[29:43] of use cases if you watch or listen to
[29:45] my podcast on a regular basis I guess
[29:48] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[29:50] the most important step is to keep the
[29:54] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[29:56] wallet my personal recommend ation for
[29:58] hard wallet is the bit box it's super
[30:01] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[30:03] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[30:06] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[30:08] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[30:12] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[30:16] robobin to get your bitbox and if you
[30:18] really want to bulletproof yourself
[30:21] custody setup your security setup and
[30:23] maybe even your citizenship setup you
[30:26] have to talk to the bsiness Bitcoin way
[30:29] if you go to the Bitcoin way.com
[30:32] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[30:35] free call where you can dive deep with
[30:38] them if your self custody setup is
[30:41] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[30:44] maybe might be improvable or your
[30:47] digital footprint in general is secure
[30:50] they are the experts in cyber security
[30:53] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[30:56] secure sovereign individual in general
[30:59] yes yeah that that's that's the use case
[31:01] I was thinking about too because that
[31:03] that time Chan aspect only came to me
[31:06] later uh on uh like a year ago I heard
[31:10] it uh I heard Roman Ria talk about it
[31:13] and I was also like what is he talking
[31:14] about and he said yeah Bitcoin is a Time
[31:17] chin I I I could not get my head around
[31:19] it but
[31:20] but it sounded serious so I uh
[31:25] went and tried to understand standard
[31:29] and that's so so amazing when you go
[31:30] down this Bitcoin Rabbit Hole you always
[31:32] meet meet new ideas and you can sort
[31:36] them out some are rubbish some are great
[31:37] because many people or high level
[31:39] bitcoiners entertain those ideas and
[31:41] then it's maybe better you get a head
[31:43] around it and the time gam was such such
[31:45] a fascinating idea I I still don't fully
[31:48] understand the technical
[31:50] detail uh like yes it's superficially I
[31:54] understand with the with the time coding
[31:55] and and the block time and that but um
[31:58] uh it's uh I understand enough of the
[32:01] time CH aspect that I think this is the
[32:03] actual core uh invention that they have
[32:06] a a Time chain that is distributed and
[32:08] and trustless so you can trust it and
[32:10] and use it to encode and and hash
[32:12] everything yeah that's a everything that
[32:14] can be communicated like money or
[32:17] contracts or what what have you that's a
[32:20] major thing having something to rely on
[32:24] uh something that where history cannot
[32:27] be Rewritten by Windows like there oh
[32:29] yes that was something I was I was going
[32:31] to say but I think that's a difficult
[32:33] one because um it's yeah that was such
[32:36] an entertaining idea to to to to encode
[32:39] the history into the blockchain
[32:42] and um but I cannot foresee if if if
[32:46] history
[32:48] uh once coted down couldn't be
[32:52] Rewritten it's you have to yeah it's you
[32:56] have to have those uh documents
[32:59] somewhere uh and because you cannot undo
[33:01] a hash in in the blockchain you have to
[33:03] have to original documents and and to
[33:06] verify uh the truth and
[33:09] um if they become if some historical
[33:13] event happens and uh the truth is
[33:16] actually in about this event is encoded
[33:18] in the blockchain by a source you can
[33:20] trust and the document becomes lost and
[33:23] somebody else with malicious intent uh
[33:25] replaces this version with the winners
[33:27] version of
[33:29] History
[33:30] um so it has some pitfalls but I have
[33:36] not thought it's completely through but
[33:38] it's Pro probably uh if there are smart
[33:41] people out there and figure it out this
[33:43] this documenting
[33:44] problem uh it's it's a way to to uh
[33:49] follow the events of history and from
[33:52] now on
[33:53] until we have a hash Collis
[33:58] it's it's I I think it's there's still
[34:01] some some Oracle problems to it like
[34:03] someone has to put the document uh on
[34:06] the blockchain and hash it and all the
[34:08] things um I released yesterday or for
[34:13] the few a week ago uh a podcast with um
[34:19] with the guy from Guatemala completely
[34:22] black now on the name uh of
[34:24] him completely for Carlos kinho Kos
[34:29] exactly Kos and and he was talking about
[34:32] that how he did it in quat and I was
[34:34] like that's really interesting concept
[34:37] but it's not 100% clear how someone
[34:39] could not swap the
[34:41] document could rewrite it somehow uh
[34:45] when when those servers get maybe lost
[34:46] in history like short term yes I I get
[34:49] it but what if it's like in a thousand
[34:53] years and also then there was like
[34:56] really interesting because we have now
[34:58] all those video podcasts we all have
[35:01] this written documents everything is
[35:03] digital we have so many versions of like
[35:06] uh like maybe the Trump shooting is
[35:08] interesting because how many fearers
[35:11] were around spinned around that think
[35:13] about a person like a thousand years
[35:16] from now looking bad against all those
[35:18] podcasts and all those theories and fig
[35:20] out like what was actually true that's
[35:22] that's a difficult thing I feel like
[35:24] yeah it's today there is no truth
[35:25] anymore you cannot trust anything you
[35:28] see on the web because uh I I saw the
[35:30] Trump shooting it was like the most
[35:32] insane thing I've seen in a very long
[35:35] time if you think about it it's it's
[35:38] completely uh Unthinkable that such a
[35:41] thing could happen and and then you have
[35:44] those uh
[35:46] eyewitnesses or eyewitness videos of the
[35:48] actual event of people warning the
[35:50] police of the shooter on the roof and
[35:53] what if those were fake what what if
[35:54] those eyewitnesses were actually uh
[35:57] agent
[35:58] and you know you there is no no way to
[36:02] um to know what happened if unless you
[36:05] were actually Donald Trump standing on a
[36:09] Podium and I mean even for him it's it's
[36:11] hard like because he only know like oh I
[36:15] got hurt and I'm now now down uh like
[36:18] even he does not really know like where
[36:20] where was the shooter actually coming
[36:21] from are there Secret Service agents
[36:23] telling me the truth yeah mindblowing
[36:26] isn't it
[36:29] so so how do we find truth then how do
[36:31] we find
[36:33] truth
[36:35] um yeah well we have the technical means
[36:38] it's it's consent it's uh it's um in in
[36:42] a Bitcoin space it's obvious how we we
[36:44] do it we agree the network agrees on a
[36:48] on a on a on a hash on on on a version
[36:51] of the blockchain and if it doesn't
[36:53] there is a fork so that's that's a
[36:56] technical way to to establish truth but
[36:59] um uh there there is no there is no
[37:03] there is no no General Truth uh in in a
[37:05] philosophical sense or something that we
[37:09] could talk about because uh on some
[37:11] things we we might agree so it's Truth
[37:14] for both of us and on some things we
[37:17] might have different views then you have
[37:18] your truth and I have mine and and I
[37:20] share mine truth with other people so
[37:22] that's it's it's just a philosophical
[37:25] idea and and and then the technical
[37:27] development we have now uh um shows that
[37:31] we we I Wonder If we have a need for
[37:34] truth anymore because when you realize
[37:36] you you cannot trust anybody but
[37:38] yourself and and you don't have to uh
[37:42] you you uh you don't um need truth even
[37:47] my my children don't speak the truth to
[37:48] me all
[37:50] day and and uh begin to imagine what
[37:53] people I do business with or or friends
[37:55] tell to me it's we we we people are we
[37:58] are lying by by nature or by because
[38:01] we're used to it sometimes and then
[38:05] truth is is a philosophical concept it
[38:07] it's it can be uh established
[38:10] technically but uh but but but not
[38:13] philosophically there will always be
[38:15] debate and and if you if you in today we
[38:19] have we know a lot more about the world
[38:21] in the universe and and TR TR truths
[38:25] that have been for a long time that have
[38:27] been held by religious leaders uh have
[38:31] uh become transparent as as lies and
[38:33] tools to manipulate people so truth is
[38:36] also a dangerous thing because it's
[38:38] being used as a as a tool to to
[38:40] manipulate and control people so I'm no
[38:42] fan of Truth or religious uh Dogma or
[38:46] stuff like that so truth is a bit of
[38:48] a difficult concept for me I don't
[38:51] embrace it that much for me too I I I I
[38:56] have this weird objection In Me growing
[39:00] if someone says the the phrase the fact
[39:03] is like I'm
[39:05] like how do we know that is a fact like
[39:08] how how do we know that's the truth I
[39:09] feel like always like um when someone
[39:12] claims that that's the truth and that's
[39:14] the fact um it's it's it's really hard
[39:17] and I love I had yesterday Twitter space
[39:20] actually and we talked about and someone
[39:22] asked me like uh oh how do you explain
[39:25] someone what Bitcoin is and and and if
[39:27] he should invest his money in Bitcoin
[39:29] and I was like I don't tell anyone to to
[39:32] buy Bitcoin I I want people to
[39:36] understand they should learn about it
[39:38] they should educate themsel about it and
[39:41] they should dive deeper into technology
[39:43] and then make themselves a a a picture
[39:46] of what is bitcoin and is it fitting in
[39:48] my life I I I would never tell you buy
[39:53] Bitcoin I would never tell even in my
[39:55] family I'm very defensive when it comes
[39:58] to bitcoin um I'm I'm I'm never bringing
[40:03] the topic even up in my family if it
[40:05] comes up I I I'll give my two cents to
[40:07] it uh as as I see it as responsible as a
[40:11] bitcoiner to to to to give it and then
[40:13] some somebody might come around and say
[40:16] like Robin how do I how can I buy it and
[40:19] then what's the process and then I I
[40:21] help them with like buying and and of
[40:23] custody and stuff like that but I would
[40:25] never tell somebody that Bitcoin is the
[40:28] truth and buy it because I don't know
[40:31] like I think Bitcoin is the truth I
[40:32] think Bitcoin is the best thing but why
[40:35] should I claim the objective truth on
[40:37] the world well yeah it's a it's a it's a
[40:40] it's a interesting idea it's a great
[40:42] great idea Robin because I also think
[40:44] about orange peing people should I do it
[40:46] and then if yes how do I do it or should
[40:49] I
[40:51] not um if I decide to not do then I I
[40:55] feel like a bit of a coward because
[40:57] you know you have as a Bitcoin I think
[41:00] or I sometimes feel that that
[41:01] responsibility to make the world a
[41:02] better place when you see the potential
[41:04] you you see the light and you of course
[41:07] want all the world to use Bitcoin it's
[41:09] like the holy gray or the the Stein
[41:12] deison um and uh so that's uh but but
[41:17] that's uh yeah there's no way you you
[41:19] you can
[41:20] force uh Bitcoin on people or talk
[41:23] people into it because uh in uh the the
[41:27] point when you become convinced of
[41:29] Bitcoin uh does not come in the
[41:31] beginning becomes when you a couple
[41:32] years or a few levels down the rabbit
[41:34] hole which takes time so I heard a lot
[41:37] of people say it takes hundreds or a
[41:39] thousand hours until you understand
[41:41] Bitcoin and I myself
[41:45] I'm by the uh YouTube and other content
[41:49] I consume uh by the podcast I listen to
[41:52] by the videos I watch by the X comments
[41:55] and stuff I read I'm easily uh way over
[41:58] a thousand hours in in Bitcoin other
[42:00] crypto so and uh it only dawned to me uh
[42:05] lately when when the governments and the
[42:07] big Pension funds and such became
[42:08] serious and and and people like Michael
[42:10] sailor so I think my Michael sailor is
[42:12] such an important uh such a important
[42:15] figure in the Bitcoin space because he's
[42:17] like an evangelist who gives us those
[42:20] those uh Central or important ideas like
[42:22] like the need to know like don't sell
[42:24] your Bitcoin all those great ideas and
[42:27] he distills his his deep knowledge and
[42:30] he's a strategic master and he he
[42:32] distills what he knows into the speech
[42:35] he gave at the BTC prag which is only
[42:37] the very surface so everybody gets the
[42:39] message I I I love that's so great to
[42:42] have this guy that that he is there and
[42:43] gives us those those milestones in order
[42:45] to uh that when you're in doubt should I
[42:48] orange PE people or not what should I do
[42:50] uh in what situation and and that's so
[42:53] so great that he's there and gives us
[42:55] those those way marks along the journey
[42:58] what was your favorite thing uh from
[43:00] from his Bitcoin par speech everything I
[43:03] was in the second row and saw him life I
[43:04] got up early to see him and uh it was um
[43:09] I wanted to see this man life and and
[43:11] feel the WIP and and see what it's what
[43:13] he's all about
[43:15] and oh I I cannot recall the whole the
[43:17] whole speech was was was great I would
[43:21] have to to look back what what what was
[43:23] it 21 uh Bitcoin yeah 2 21 rules of
[43:29] Bitcoin it was it was a great speech
[43:31] because it was so
[43:33] comprehensive and uh with so many Easter
[43:36] eggs and then links to pop culture like
[43:38] the metrix and such and and it's actual
[43:41] philosophy and it was it was very deep
[43:43] and very comprehensive at the same time
[43:45] so that's a way that Michael sailor can
[43:48] put things he can put things in a way
[43:50] that that people can understand who have
[43:52] no uh no technical uh idea of Bitcoin
[43:56] but more more of a gut feeling about it
[43:59] who who are interested in and want to uh
[44:03] to see what it's all about I I had him
[44:07] uh so he is an evangelist yeah he's an
[44:09] absolute and really good one in that
[44:12] sense and I had him uh on the podcast
[44:16] four hours after his speech like four or
[44:18] five hours after he was on bitcoin prag
[44:20] he was actually uh on my podcast uh so
[44:23] we recorded for the podcast podcast came
[44:25] out like a week later uh
[44:27] and I asked him what his favorite rule
[44:30] out of his 21 rules are and his favorite
[44:33] rule is the spread Bitcoin with love and
[44:36] he went deep yeah that was a good one
[44:37] that was an amazing one and I I really
[44:41] was then after that like even a week
[44:43] after that someone asked me um a crypto
[44:46] channel has like a lot of mem coins on
[44:49] there they're also talking about Bitcoin
[44:51] but they also talking about all the
[44:52] altcoins and they were asking me hey do
[44:54] you want to speak on on our panel and I
[44:57] was like I usually say no to that like I
[45:00] don't want to affiliate myself to to
[45:02] altcoins but I was like if we really
[45:05] want to spread Bitcoin as as far as
[45:07] possible we have to take every
[45:09] possibility to uh talk with the people
[45:12] and spread Bitcoin and in there there
[45:15] was one guy who uh has also his own own
[45:20] meme coin and you you could feel it he
[45:22] wants to sell it he was really toxic
[45:25] against bitco Maxes and he said um words
[45:29] that I don't even want to take in my uh
[45:31] in my mouth against Bitcoin Maxes
[45:33] against Bitcoin in general uh and I in
[45:37] that moment M was really in the back of
[45:40] my mind it's like spread Bitcoin with
[45:42] love like be that one person that is
[45:45] even though there is someone yelling at
[45:48] a group that you affiliate with yourself
[45:51] um be kind be be loving and be
[45:54] respectful of of that person still and
[45:57] uh I got I think five or six messages
[46:00] after that saying thank you for staying
[46:03] levelheaded thank you for being a kind
[46:05] person in that chat and not Bling by
[46:08] this toxic rules and I think that's
[46:11] really important uh even if someone in
[46:13] your life gets like oh W Bitcoin is just
[46:16] for criminal oh yeah okay like be be
[46:19] loving with that be respectful with that
[46:21] and I feel like that's a way better
[46:23] approach and Michael saor went on like
[46:25] 20 25 minutes to explain
[46:27] with with sales with how we how we can
[46:30] actually get Bitcoin in the mass market
[46:32] and everything in the podcast I love
[46:35] that segment a lot and I couldn't go on
[46:37] and and tell too much about it yes yes
[46:41] spread Bitcoin with love that there's a
[46:43] hidden truth in it it's it's it's uh but
[46:46] it's feels natural to and good to uh to
[46:49] spread Bitcoin or as to say to to buy
[46:52] something with sets so uh I noticed when
[46:56] I bought my first beer with SATs in
[46:58] Prague it felt so much more satisfying
[47:01] than buying it with Fiat and I think
[47:02] that's what Michael sailor is saying
[47:04] that you spread Bitcoin with love when
[47:06] you make transactions and you you you
[47:08] spread Good Vibrations and and get
[47:09] something back with the product you buy
[47:10] for it so that's yet another layer of of
[47:14] the of the protocol maybe Subzero the
[47:16] Subzero level is love and uh I I thought
[47:21] well I think uh I call Bitcoin now the
[47:26] orange love
[47:27] machine oh I I I I saw saw that handle
[47:30] of yours also yes and it it came to me I
[47:33] think even before Michael sailor speech
[47:36] so so that last thing is such
[47:39] a a core uh element of of the of the
[47:44] Grassroots uh Bitcoin
[47:48] people and it's probably way different
[47:51] an attitude towards the Bitcoin as a big
[47:56] big money companies have but maybe they
[47:58] will learn from it um but yeah spread
[48:02] Bitcoin with love absolutely worked in
[48:04] PR because everybody had this loving
[48:06] Vibe I met people from all over the
[48:08] world and it it was not uh it it was not
[48:11] a techie or financial conference it was
[48:15] actually so much love in there because
[48:18] everybody loved to be there and loved
[48:19] what they did there and loved to meet
[48:21] people from all over the world so there
[48:22] was a lot of love in the air a lot I I
[48:26] even had one podcast where we compared
[48:29] the the hippie movement the the loving
[48:31] movement uh a little bit with the the
[48:33] Bitcoin uh movement because it's it's
[48:36] it's such an it's such a nice experience
[48:39] like you get addicted to bitcoin
[48:41] conferences I had this year to really
[48:45] emotionally step back and focus on the
[48:47] podcast focusing like getting the
[48:49] podcast off the ground and not be every
[48:52] week at a Bitcoin conference all around
[48:54] the world because that's honestly the
[48:56] thing that really want to do just go
[48:58] from Bitcoin governence to bitcoin
[48:59] governence and meet with everyone U but
[49:02] I also want to contribute something and
[49:04] not
[49:05] just contribute something to society and
[49:08] contribute something to to bitcoin um
[49:10] and and so the the podcast is really
[49:13] important for me to to do something for
[49:15] Bitcoin and I love also speaking with
[49:17] the people um but getting it off the
[49:19] ground is is the one thing that why I
[49:22] cannot go to all the Bitcoin conferences
[49:24] this year and I think next year I will
[49:26] will be at like maybe 10 or maybe 15 I
[49:30] would love that there are so many great
[49:31] ones that I missed out this year yes I I
[49:35] was BTC prag was my first one ever and
[49:39] uh so and since it's the biggest and
[49:42] most important one in Europe I I
[49:43] absolutely wanted to go there and but I
[49:46] I never expected it to be that good I
[49:49] expected a
[49:51] lot uh but not that that much love and
[49:55] positivity
[49:57] and and how well this whole thing was
[49:59] produced and organized is so
[50:02] professional and had a had a great time
[50:04] there and uh yeah a lot of beer I'm I'm
[50:07] already looking forward to the to the
[50:09] next one yes me too the it's like the
[50:11] best beer in the world and I say I say
[50:13] that as someone coming from Germany they
[50:15] make the best
[50:17] beer uh out there the Czech people and
[50:20] they they had you could buy tap beer on
[50:22] the on the
[50:24] conference um with with uh Sates and
[50:28] that was that was great beer for a great
[50:33] asset by the way for everyone also for
[50:36] for you if you want to buy early early
[50:38] early early early tickets they're
[50:40] already available and you can even buy
[50:42] them already now with discount code
[50:44] Robin I think you get 10% off or
[50:46] something like that oh cool uh so like
[50:48] uh I think the Bitcoin Brock organizers
[50:51] hit me up like two days after the
[50:53] conference and they said like hey for
[50:55] the next conference you're ticket code
[50:57] is already renewed uh so they are I got
[51:01] a really an an an behind the scenes look
[51:04] on all the Bitcoin PR things because
[51:06] they were sponsors I talked with them uh
[51:09] and they are so professional they are so
[51:12] well organized um they are so on the
[51:15] topic um I I loved it from the beginning
[51:18] beginning to the end and I will 100% uh
[51:21] sponsor like um uh um advertise for them
[51:25] also next year MH closer to the event of
[51:28] course um but they they are amazing how
[51:31] was the conference in general for you oh
[51:34] it was it was it was beautiful I uh I
[51:37] was in a couple
[51:38] speeches and uh of Michael Sailors uh
[51:42] was one I followed completely and then
[51:44] maybe one or two more but uh mostly I
[51:48] was around in the in the Expo talking to
[51:51] people and or in the foyer chatting with
[51:54] people uh drinking coffee drinking beer
[51:57] so it was like 90% chatting having fun
[52:01] and or say 80% chatting having fun uh
[52:05] 15% checking out the Expo for Hardware
[52:09] software and 5%
[52:12] panels and yeah because I I also what I
[52:15] love uh doing the most is like meeting
[52:17] people and I will I'm I'm pretty sure
[52:21] I'm going to go again next year because
[52:24] I never had such an easy time meeting
[52:25] new people because they have this
[52:27] connecting topic and also so many uh
[52:29] intelligent people I have never met so
[52:31] many intelligent people in in one Bunch
[52:35] uh with a good attitude because there
[52:36] are lots of intelligent people but they
[52:38] think they're smart and and they want to
[52:40] sell you stuff and on a Bitcoin
[52:42] conference like you said I I was there
[52:44] with a guy half a minute I I realized oh
[52:47] he's Shilling something and then I went
[52:49] on you can you can smell such people
[52:53] when you're a
[52:54] bitcoiner and um uh that had such an
[52:57] amazing conference it was like yeah like
[52:59] the orange love machine at work I love I
[53:03] I love orange love machine yeah let's
[53:05] get the term out there I I probably will
[53:08] use it more in the podcast I I saw it
[53:11] yesterday uh on on some chat like orange
[53:14] love machine and then I was like
[53:15] interesting orange love machine and now
[53:17] you told me like ah that it actually
[53:19] makes sense like love is the basis for
[53:21] for for bit I think the third ever guest
[53:24] said Bitcoin is love this this was for
[53:27] me the first time where I thought about
[53:29] it a little bit uh but it's it's a
[53:32] fundamental truth I feel like um having
[53:35] Bitcoin when when it's connected to
[53:37] trust it's like because it's trustless
[53:38] you can trust that a transaction
[53:40] actually goes through when you send it
[53:42] okay uh if you send it in a on a
[53:44] different on the wrong address which
[53:48] happened uh it's also you can trust that
[53:51] you made the mistakes and you don't get
[53:53] it back like it's it's like an honest
[53:55] loving machine it's really cool was it
[53:57] the other Michael we talked about today
[54:00] uh no uh it was the third ever podcast
[54:03] it
[54:04] was
[54:06] um oh man I was not oh never
[54:09] mind yeah I unfortunately don't remember
[54:12] the name it's it's uh it's embarrassing
[54:14] if if if I cannot remember the podcast
[54:16] names oh we had so many guests I I I I
[54:19] hear because I I I am not good at uh
[54:22] remembering names I am probably way
[54:24] worse than you at remembering names
[54:27] yeah when when I talk to people a lot I
[54:29] I remember them of course but uh uh
[54:32] sometimes people meet me and say hey
[54:34] Norman and uh ah yeah we met because I
[54:37] I'm good at remembering faces but I suck
[54:39] at remembering names and some people
[54:41] they they talk to me once even drunk and
[54:43] and then they remember my name it always
[54:45] embarrasses me a little bit but but I
[54:47] got used to it so it's just what it is
[54:50] yeah it's uh it's it's a skill that I
[54:53] wish I could do also better like you
[54:56] have so many contacts and and podcasts
[54:58] and you meet like probably uh three new
[55:01] people every day on the web or in real
[55:04] life
[55:05] so yeah I think that's actually a good
[55:08] average free because uh you get to know
[55:11] like I actively write people uh when
[55:14] they when I see someone interesting for
[55:15] the podcast then uh more and more it
[55:18] happens that past uh podcast guest or
[55:21] even people uh that um I I love and I
[55:25] trust uh bringing people on like hey he
[55:28] would also be great for your podcast
[55:29] like I get a podcast suggestions like
[55:32] probably like four times a week
[55:34] something like that uh so so networking
[55:37] is something that uh is now actually
[55:41] completely automated on my part just
[55:44] with the podcast because people bring up
[55:45] more people to me yeah yeah yeah
[55:48] networking that's that's networking uh
[55:51] in a technical sense and in a human
[55:53] sense Bitcoin uh connecting noes uh each
[55:57] other it will be great to it's so
[55:59] beautiful isn't it imagine Bitcoin is
[56:02] actually successful in like let's say 20
[56:05] years and you know all those people from
[56:08] the early days and you know they were
[56:11] there in like the early OG days because
[56:14] now people think they're late but in 20
[56:16] years the people that come in right now
[56:19] those are the OES
[56:24] yes that's uh that's an amazing yeah
[56:26] it's this OG term it's so funny because
[56:28] I I got called OG by uh people who are
[56:32] who have been in for like five
[56:35] years and they are already very savy
[56:38] very smart people uh who have a like a
[56:40] financial background dealing with stocks
[56:43] and in real interest and and and and and
[56:45] and uh playing back and forth with money
[56:49] and interest trates and I have no mind
[56:52] for that that's not my game yeah I could
[56:55] never figure out how this whole money
[56:56] Game Works some people are good at it
[56:58] and they can figure out how
[57:01] to uh make money by Landing it and then
[57:05] putting it into some funny circular
[57:08] business and and winding up with more
[57:09] money than they put in but that's not my
[57:11] game I think the the most important game
[57:14] in Bitcoin is buying it and then keeping
[57:18] it not losing it but but you also have
[57:21] to to spend it in order to make it work
[57:25] as a as a money yeah
[57:29] um yeah that's it's uh it's uh I think
[57:34] it's it's going to regulate if you have
[57:36] a a big stack of Bitcoin and the value
[57:40] is going up because lots of people are
[57:42] hling um and if lots of people are
[57:45] holding and no one's transacting then
[57:47] the value is going to go down so in in
[57:49] Fiat term so it's uh it's going
[57:53] to it's probably going to like balance
[57:55] some somehow in uh with holding and and
[57:58] and spending because people will want
[58:01] luxury uh but there's also a lot of
[58:03] people who follow this Frugal theory
[58:06] that Bitcoin makes it more frugal
[58:07] because it's such a great asset what
[58:09] what else could you want you you
[58:11] wouldn't want uh trade your Bitcoin for
[58:12] a flashy watch or a fast car maybe
[58:15] because that's not better than having
[58:18] Bitcoin and uh maybe but maybe a
[58:21] farmhouse yeah maybe something yeah of
[58:24] course something with a farmhouse or
[58:27] yeah some things yeah so I think
[58:29] actually like um every every bitcoiner
[58:33] will start spending their Bitcoin at
[58:34] some point like if you keep on to your
[58:38] Bitcoin your Bitcoin stack will probably
[58:42] outgrow your potential earnings that you
[58:44] have as an income at some point um
[58:47] because your stack is is uh feeded by
[58:51] your income so it has an advantage there
[58:53] so at some point you will see oh I have
[58:56] like I don't let's say 5,000 coming in
[58:59] each month MH but I have this 5 million
[59:03] uh EUR Bitcoin stack I want to maybe um
[59:08] uh buy this this Farmhouse or I want to
[59:11] buy maybe someone also wants to buy just
[59:13] a flashy car like that that that's fair
[59:15] game so I think like no matter what it
[59:17] is in your head everyone wants to have
[59:19] have something and and they are and even
[59:23] if it's just traveling the world
[59:25] traveling the world is expensive oh yeah
[59:27] absolutely like you need money for for
[59:29] life oh yeah yeah traveling would is one
[59:32] of the things I would spend my I would
[59:35] and uh yeah yeah farmouse great idea so
[59:39] I think only a small percentage of
[59:41] people actually are like oh I stacked
[59:44] and now I want to die with that
[59:46] stack or give it to my
[59:48] children yeah that's um something I
[59:52] think about what what what what is the
[59:55] best thing that Michael sailor could do
[59:56] with his stack and what's his
[59:59] purpose uh maybe he's going to release
[60:02] it unto the
[60:05] world in his Testament or maybe during
[60:08] his living days in order to Orange Peel
[60:11] uh the world in in a certain
[60:14] way move of him um yeah but it would be
[60:19] a great experiment because I think if
[60:21] you if you get Bitcoin and you not you
[60:24] don't have the spirit you will spend it
[60:25] for for for stuff like a millionaire who
[60:29] wins in a lottery does and with M who's
[60:32] not used to a lot of of cash and there
[60:35] lots of people who have won the lottery
[60:36] and became suddenly rich and then a year
[60:39] or two later they were more broke than
[60:41] ever and with Michael's situation is
[60:44] like he was already extremely wealthy
[60:47] before Bitcoin oh yeah so it's like he
[60:50] does not need his Bitcoin stack to fuel
[60:53] his lifestyle like whatever he wanted
[60:56] afford he could also afford without
[60:57] Bitcoin from his current income so it's
[61:00] like interesting what he does with his
[61:02] stack um will be will be interesting I I
[61:06] I would love to see that he has the
[61:09] majority of his um stack just released
[61:12] to the to the Bitcoin uh blockchain and
[61:14] kind of burn forever and and make it
[61:17] make a donation to everyone well yeah
[61:19] maybe once this mission is done but but
[61:22] at the the stage Bitcoin is now in it's
[61:24] important phases and and people to
[61:26] to grow yeah and uh I think that Michael
[61:30] sa is one of the most important people
[61:32] concerning that 100% yeah um really cool
[61:37] we already over one hour as I saw
[61:39] already that went fast that went really
[61:40] fast we only got started like like in
[61:42] Prague like in Prague Robin you know
[61:44] we've been chatting for hours on end and
[61:46] we only got started we we just scratched
[61:49] at the door of the rabbit hole like like
[61:50] Gandalf scratched at at Bilbo store in B
[61:53] end
[61:56] yeah maybe uh when you come back again
[61:58] let's make the second round all right
[62:00] yeah be there and back again yeah all
[62:02] right uh perfect but uh before we have
[62:05] the entro we have this new question that
[62:07] I always ask my guest now uh what can we
[62:10] learn from you besides
[62:13] Bitcoin oh
[62:16] great um what can you learn from me
[62:19] besides
[62:20] Bitcoin oh I hate that question because
[62:24] that that that would require me to talk
[62:26] positively about
[62:27] myself which I I don't normally do I I
[62:30] try to to be uh positive towards people
[62:33] as good as I can and have a good time
[62:35] with
[62:36] people and uh sometimes I I want to to
[62:41] spread uh people uh or positivity among
[62:45] among people so that's uh that's uh not
[62:48] a a learning thing but an an attitude
[62:51] thing that I can spread so um I always
[62:56] try to to have a good time with people
[62:59] and and that people who are with me have
[63:01] have a good time too and what what you
[63:04] can possibly learn from me is that it's
[63:06] uh always better to have a good uh
[63:09] attitude and be
[63:11] positive uh about everything than um
[63:15] crying and complaining but that sounds
[63:18] bit shallow but uh I I have no really
[63:20] good way of putting what what you can
[63:22] learn from me I think that's a great uh
[63:25] thing to learn from you and I think you
[63:27] we already saw that throughout the
[63:29] podcast with spreading Bitcoin with love
[63:31] and and all that uh so thank you for
[63:34] that um before uh now we come to the
[63:38] actual end routine where the previous
[63:39] guest is asking a question for the next
[63:41] guest without knowing who the next guest
[63:42] uh will be uh and your question from the
[63:45] previous guest is um how did Bitcoin
[63:49] affect your
[63:51] life oh that's a great question because
[63:54] it made my life
[63:56] a lot
[63:58] better
[63:59] um as it is now and it was also a
[64:03] nerve-wrecking journey because I've been
[64:05] holding Bitcoin for like 11 years now
[64:08] and I realized that I'm emotionally
[64:10] attached to the Fiat value of of of the
[64:14] Bitcoin and so it was like a roller
[64:16] coaster Journey uh a a decade long
[64:19] journey with a lot of ups and down so
[64:22] sometimes it it was nerve-wracking
[64:24] desperate
[64:26] and uh but now my my my confidence has
[64:29] grown so much so it it has elevated me
[64:34] into a like a exclusive circle of of
[64:37] Bitcoin owners so to
[64:40] say and sometimes I feel that the days
[64:43] of my financial worries are finally over
[64:46] so it made my uh life in in a financial
[64:49] way
[64:50] potentially uh completely trouble-free
[64:53] but it also gave me a
[64:56] a lot of confidence and a lot of relief
[65:00] that we actually actually live in times
[65:04] that such a thing as Bitcoin is possible
[65:06] that that we actually have to because we
[65:08] are the first generation in humankind
[65:10] have to technical uh background or
[65:13] possibility to uh incept something like
[65:16] Bitcoin so uh it it's completely
[65:21] mindblowing uh what Bitcoin actually
[65:24] potentially might
[65:26] become a l and and it's if you if you if
[65:30] we have Bitcoin like 2,000 years in the
[65:32] future we will be like the OG's of the
[65:35] OG's of the
[65:37] OG's and it will be documented so it's
[65:40] uh it's a it's uh uh impossible to
[65:44] wholly get my head around what Bitcoin
[65:47] did to to me personally and to the world
[65:50] I love it a lot um I usually ask in the
