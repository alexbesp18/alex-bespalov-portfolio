[00:00] your first Bitcoin is the easiest we're
[00:01] at 65,000 a Bitcoin you're going to have
[00:03] to make a sacrifice or two you're just a
[00:05] normal family a normal person living on
[00:07] a normal income you got to make a
[00:08] sacrifice but that's going to show
[00:10] exactly where your priorities lie I had
[00:12] eight rental properties I sold six of
[00:14] them got in a Bitcoin with that most of
[00:16] my stocks that like tech companies all
[00:19] that stuff is gone you don't want to
[00:20] hold assets that are denominated in a
[00:23] currency that's just falling someone can
[00:25] take something from you it's not really
[00:26] yours 2022 I got kicked out of a bank
[00:30] because I said the word Bitcoin you put
[00:31] your money into the bank that's the
[00:33] bank's money and they'll give you access
[00:34] to it until they don't your money is a
[00:36] proxy of your time and they're taking
[00:38] your money via taxes or inflation
[00:40] they're stealing the time from you but
[00:42] you can't get that time back both sides
[00:44] the red side and the blue side they're
[00:45] both fighting for access to the money
[00:47] machine right to the money printer they
[00:49] need to work with the Federal Reserve so
[00:50] they can make up all these imaginary
[00:52] bills get them passed get them sign
[00:54] create bonds out of nowhere so then the
[00:56] FED can buy them and then that creates
[00:58] more inflation the richest people the
[01:00] history of the world couldn't do what
[01:02] I'm doing right now which is I was
[01:03] eating crab legs and watching YouTube
[01:05] John D Rockefeller couldn't do this I
[01:07] used to wake up in the morning and look
[01:08] for stocks to trade and now I just go
[01:10] water my
[01:13] grass you treated whatever you do
[01:16] however you do get to one whole Bitcoin
[01:19] yeah uh which is I think a message that
[01:21] I really really like uh even though I'm
[01:24] aware that not everyone on the Earth
[01:26] right now for them it's possible to do
[01:28] that but I think most of my listeners
[01:31] actually are capable of going there if
[01:34] they really want to or they already
[01:36] there um but what is it exactly of this
[01:39] like one Bitcoin why is that Bitcoin
[01:41] getting the one Bitcoin so so important
[01:43] for you well one I believe that wherever
[01:46] you spend your money and how you spend
[01:47] your energy your time it shows a lot
[01:49] about your priorities so to get to one
[01:52] Bitcoin is to say like I'm on this
[01:54] journey you know so I think pushing
[01:57] yourself because what what for most
[01:59] people going to require you one to catch
[02:01] Bitcoin early or two to make sacrifices
[02:03] to get there right so at this price you
[02:06] know we're at 65,000 a Bitcoin you're
[02:09] going to have to make a sacrifice or two
[02:10] you know if you're just a normal family
[02:12] a normal person living on a normal
[02:13] income you got to make a sacrifice but
[02:16] that's going to show exactly where your
[02:17] priorities lie so I also had this saying
[02:22] that like you know your first Bitcoin is
[02:24] the hardest because if bitcoin's going
[02:26] up then you know and you were able to
[02:28] buy a Bitcoin for 2 3,000
[02:30] or $5,000 versus down for 65,000 that
[02:33] would make your first one harder you
[02:35] know so I think once you climb that Hill
[02:37] you get your first one and you're like
[02:39] all right that's that's or sorry your
[02:41] your first Bitcoin is the easiest
[02:42] because the price goes up right and but
[02:45] it becomes like a matter of priority so
[02:48] what are you willing to do to get there
[02:50] and as you're learning you start to
[02:52] understand the importance of you know
[02:54] selling that Fiat to get you a Bitcoin
[02:57] so I think it just to me it shows that
[02:59] this is a priority
[03:00] it and you are I think you still
[03:03] invested in other things or how how much
[03:05] of a priority for you already uh Bitcoin
[03:09] is so all right so I had eight rental
[03:12] properties I sold six of them right got
[03:15] in a Bitcoin with that most of my stocks
[03:18] that like tech companies all that stuff
[03:20] is gone right so yeah I I still have
[03:24] some cars that are going to go I still
[03:26] have those two rental properties that
[03:28] got to go but I've been on a serious
[03:30] mission so now at this point I'm putting
[03:32] like maybe 80 90% of my uh uh income
[03:36] away
[03:38] so when 2022 when Bitcoin fell under
[03:42] like 25,000 that's why I was like all
[03:44] right I need to make you know a decision
[03:46] what whether I'm going to try to catch
[03:48] the rebound in the stock market or I'm
[03:50] going to stop dabbling in Bitcoin and
[03:53] actually go all in you know and start it
[03:56] start to make it a priority so that's
[03:57] what I start doing so I start buying buy
[03:59] and buying and buying and I'm showing
[04:01] people and telling people and educating
[04:03] people like I'm going to leave by
[04:04] example this is what I'm doing I'll let
[04:06] you guys know I'm getting rid of this
[04:07] rental property I'm getting rid of these
[04:09] stocks so I kind of like documented all
[04:11] this for you know my Investment Group
[04:13] and I'm like this is you know I'm
[04:15] leading by example like this is that
[04:17] serious to me it's it's really cool to
[04:20] to see that it's also like you have so
[04:22] many investment uh possibilities and
[04:24] opportunities like you have stocks as
[04:26] you said you have real estate rental
[04:28] properties you even have businesses you
[04:30] can buy your income and stuff like that
[04:32] um why is Bitcoin better than all those
[04:36] stocks real estate and other
[04:38] opportunities why what does make Bitcoin
[04:41] so um attractive right now all right so
[04:44] one all those stocks are denominated in
[04:46] dollars and the value of the dollar is
[04:48] going down so like I heard Michael
[04:51] sailor say you have the best seat on the
[04:52] Titanic it doesn't matter you're still
[04:54] on a Titanic you know so that's like
[04:56] that was kind of obvious but another
[04:58] thing was dealing with the maintenance
[04:59] cost of things so there's the cost to
[05:01] purchase something and then there's the
[05:03] true value of that thing right so for
[05:05] instance I live in my home but I have to
[05:07] pay property taxes or my rental
[05:09] properties I have to there's maintenance
[05:11] there's there's Insurance there's all
[05:13] these things and then you have to deal
[05:14] with the tenants and you have to screen
[05:16] tenants deal with their issues and help
[05:17] them you know apply for this voucher do
[05:19] this or do that and then when they move
[05:21] out you're spending more money so
[05:23] there's like a maintenance required for
[05:25] let's say real estate you know so you're
[05:27] basically paying to upkeep your own
[05:30] property right so going down this
[05:32] Bitcoin Journey made me realize like
[05:34] okay well what is like what is ownership
[05:37] you know so for instance this house that
[05:39] I that I live in I bought this house and
[05:41] then every year I'm paying $50,000 in
[05:43] property taxes and it makes me wonder
[05:45] like okay do I actually own it if I have
[05:48] to keep paying to maintain it right even
[05:50] though you know I own it in cash it's
[05:54] basically like me renting it from the
[05:56] government because I have to keep paying
[05:57] it or someone's going to take it from me
[05:59] so then then during this journey of you
[06:01] know learning about Bitcoin I start
[06:03] realizing like what is ownership you
[06:05] know so it made me question a lot of
[06:07] things but one of the main things was
[06:10] one you don't want to hold assets that
[06:11] are denominated in a currency that's
[06:14] just falling and then two the
[06:15] maintenance cost of whatever that you're
[06:18] buying and storing your value in I I
[06:20] think that's that that's really cool um
[06:22] how did it CH it seems like it changed
[06:25] something uh in you your perception or
[06:28] your definition of of ownership how did
[06:30] that change like what what did you
[06:32] thought before of ownership and how do
[06:34] you think now about ownership yeah so
[06:36] what I started to realize is like if
[06:38] someone can take something from you it's
[06:40] not really yours right or if someone can
[06:42] force you to keep paying on something
[06:43] it's not really yours so I have a lot of
[06:44] cars I have a car collection right and
[06:47] every year I have to pay to re-register
[06:49] these cars and I'm like even when you
[06:51] think like I bought this car it's mine
[06:53] it's not yours you know like if you have
[06:55] to keep registering it so what I start
[06:57] realizing is what these governments do
[06:58] is they take these rights away from you
[07:01] and then they sell them back to you you
[07:03] know and the more I started looking at
[07:05] it like that I'm like yeah the things
[07:07] that
[07:08] you the things that can be taken from
[07:10] you aren't yours you know it's you're
[07:13] just renting them from the government or
[07:14] until you make the wrong person mad then
[07:16] they'll come take them and that's when I
[07:18] started kind of like realizing like oh
[07:20] this is this is like a very important
[07:23] aspect of Bitcoin you know and I've been
[07:25] kic 2022 I got kicked out of a bank
[07:29] right
[07:30] and I got kicked out of a bank because I
[07:31] said the word Bitcoin right so what I
[07:34] was doing is and this is Navy feral for
[07:36] you guys out there watching you
[07:37] Americans out there watching especially
[07:38] veterans so I used to have to call Navy
[07:41] Federal to send a wire to coinbase right
[07:43] so I can buy Bitcoin so every day I'm
[07:47] sending these wires and of course it's
[07:48] suspicious because I'm sending like you
[07:49] know a decent amount of money and then
[07:51] what ends up happening is one time they
[07:53] like have to transfer me well they
[07:54] always have to transfer me to the
[07:56] security officer or whatever and she
[07:58] asked me questions like oh what the
[07:59] funds come from all that stuff and I'm
[08:01] like yeah I own these businesses you
[08:02] know I get business deposits Monday
[08:04] through Friday that's where the money
[08:05] comes from blah blah blah like that
[08:06] she's like oh like what she's making it
[08:08] seem like almost like you know she's
[08:10] actually curious and she's like uh so
[08:13] what kind of business is it and I'm like
[08:15] well I have different businesses I have
[08:16] e-commerce business I have educational
[08:18] businesses I have real estate businesses
[08:19] you know she's like oh like what do you
[08:21] educate people about and I'm like real
[08:23] estate stocks Bitcoin she stopped me
[08:26] dead in my track she said oh you have a
[08:27] Bitcoin business you can't here I said
[08:30] no it's not a Bitcoin business it's
[08:32] educational business and we teach people
[08:34] about Bitcoin she said that's a Bitcoin
[08:36] business kick me out kick my partner out
[08:38] and I'm like okay then it becomes a
[08:40] hassle to go get the money that you have
[08:43] sitting in that account and then I have
[08:45] credit cards with this company or with
[08:46] this uh bank so I have to drive to the
[08:48] bank to go pay and I'm like this is such
[08:50] an inconvenience you know and just any
[08:52] given second someone can decide that you
[08:54] said the wrong thing or that you know
[08:56] whatever their Bank policies are and I'm
[08:58] sure they have them for good reasons but
[09:01] they can just up and you know kind of
[09:03] reroute your life and your day and you
[09:05] know make this thing a big hassle and
[09:08] you think that your first instinct is
[09:10] like that's my money you know and then
[09:11] as you start to learn about Bitcoin you
[09:13] realize like no you put your money into
[09:14] the bank that's the bank's money and
[09:16] they'll give you access to it until they
[09:18] don't you know or until it's a security
[09:21] problem and then you know they got to
[09:22] review it and then you can come get your
[09:23] money from the branch in three weeks
[09:26] you're like man this is really
[09:28] inconvenient and that's so crazy uh like
[09:30] there there's a Bitcoin founder that I
[09:32] met on a on a on a conference and he
[09:35] said like he he he founded a Bitcoin
[09:37] company in Austria and he said like if
[09:40] you found anything with Bitcoin just
[09:41] don't call it anything with Bitcoin
[09:43] because you have problems down the road
[09:46] don't don't call it anything with bitco
[09:47] anything at all and I and I kind of knew
[09:49] that and I was just like yeah it's an
[09:51] educational company you know like
[09:52] because that's what we do we educate
[09:53] people you know and she's like oh like
[09:56] that's really cool like what do you
[09:57] educate people about I'm like stocks
[09:58] real estate big Bitcoin it's a Bitcoin
[10:01] company I'm like this lady right here so
[10:04] it's man it's things like that where you
[10:06] start to realize like man like this this
[10:09] whole system is kind of set up so you
[10:12] keep having to go to work so you have to
[10:14] keep paying on things right you keep
[10:17] paying into the system and then the
[10:19] system is kind of designed in a way
[10:21] where I don't necessarily know if they
[10:23] want you to if they want to have more
[10:25] let's say with taxes or they want you to
[10:27] have less right cuz the less you you
[10:29] have then the less Sovereign you can
[10:31] become you know and you start to realize
[10:34] like man this game is just a big system
[10:36] of like taking things from people and if
[10:39] your money is a proxy of your time and
[10:41] they're taking your money via taxes or
[10:43] inflation they're stealing the time from
[10:45] you but you can't get that time back you
[10:47] know so your time is your luxury and
[10:51] there's nothing that anyone can do to
[10:52] give you any time back you know
[10:55] so a a good way to like think about this
[10:58] is if you put a th000 hours of working
[11:00] and in exchange you get
[11:02] $100,000 and then you go to the store
[11:04] and you're only able to spend 80,000 of
[11:06] it well they just took 20% of that right
[11:09] so in a way you can find a way to make
[11:11] more money but you can't find a way to
[11:13] get those hours back so you were robbed
[11:15] that way with inflation what if they
[11:17] give you $100,000 and you have to pay
[11:19] 20,000 for taxes it's the same thing
[11:22] right that's unpaid work that you were
[11:24] doing so either way if money is a proxy
[11:27] of your energy and your time they just
[11:28] stole it from you and I start thinking
[11:30] about things like
[11:32] that it's it's also crazy for me that uh
[11:35] they even ask you whether funds are
[11:37] coming from like why why do do they ask
[11:40] if they have they a good reason for for
[11:42] that yeah that's yeah that's another
[11:45] thing too you're like man like and then
[11:47] what's crazy is you can like o just open
[11:49] the account and you'll see like stripe
[11:51] you know like gumroad stripe and then or
[11:54] this like County paying real estate or
[11:57] or like you know whatever and you're
[11:58] like okay you could kind of already see
[12:00] where it's coming from now you're
[12:01] questioning me about having money
[12:03] because it's a unnormal amount of money
[12:05] but who's to say what's normal who's to
[12:07] say what's not you know it's all
[12:09] relative so yeah and and then I think
[12:13] just like the power that one person can
[12:15] have to be like all right you're out of
[12:17] this Bank you know I'm like man I've
[12:18] been banking here for like 10 years you
[12:20] know and I say one word and it's a wrap
[12:22] for me you know and that was pretty
[12:24] annoying man wait when you banked with
[12:27] them 10 years and just because of that
[12:29] one conversation where you mentioned
[12:31] Bitcoin they they kicked you out Y and
[12:33] they kicked my business partner out she
[12:34] didn't even call them and talk to them
[12:36] about anything but just her association
[12:39] with the business because we have we
[12:40] both have our individual accounts and
[12:41] then we have the business bank account
[12:44] and they seen she was tied to the
[12:45] business bank account they kicked her
[12:46] out too you're like this is crazy that's
[12:50] crazy how much do you think this now
[12:53] changes with the black rock ETF with the
[12:55] Bitcoin ETFs and the regulatory
[12:57] Frameworks maybe even with like Trump in
[12:59] in administration oh oh sorry you are in
[13:02] America right I think you're like how
[13:05] what impact do you think uh the Trump
[13:07] talking about Bitcoin friendly a Bitcoin
[13:10] ETF coming into the scene now do does
[13:13] that change thing is that like now the
[13:15] turning point for for all those things
[13:17] where the banks all of the sudden accept
[13:19] Bitcoin yep so I think there's different
[13:21] levels of acceptance that Bitcoin will
[13:23] go through and the the easier or the
[13:27] more accepted Bitcoin is I think the
[13:29] higher price people will pay but when so
[13:31] for instance all the the the um Bitcoin
[13:35] holders that front Rand uh Black Rock
[13:38] you get in at a better price right pre
[13:40] ETFs post ETFs but I think what happens
[13:42] is now you have this very large asset
[13:45] manager that's vouching for you know
[13:48] this this uh this commodity so then what
[13:51] happens is all their business partners
[13:53] will then you know recognize it to
[13:55] include Banks to include you know um
[13:59] your your Congressman your Senators your
[14:01] your the president itself so yeah I
[14:04] think as it becomes more and more
[14:06] accepted then yeah it'll trickle down to
[14:09] the banks and to individual people
[14:11] looking at you stop looking at you funny
[14:13] when you talk about Bitcoin you know
[14:14] because people are like uh either you're
[14:16] a crook or you're a criminal or you're
[14:18] doing something weird or you're into
[14:20] this magic internet money so I think it
[14:22] it is slowly but surely becoming uh like
[14:26] normalized and I think if not this
[14:29] election then the next election for sure
[14:31] like there's going to be a lot of this
[14:34] is what we're going to do for these
[14:35] people who are holding this
[14:37] token yeah it's it's crazy in America I
[14:40] don't know if the stud is true but I saw
[14:41] it where there's more Bitcoin owners
[14:44] than dog owners so it's like kind of
[14:45] like if you're against Bitcoin you have
[14:47] a hard time getting elected these days
[14:49] yeah I I don't N I wouldn't think that's
[14:54] true man everybody out here is a damn
[14:56] dog you go to the gym everybody has a
[14:59] dog with them you go to the dentist
[15:00] everyone has a dog with them you talk
[15:02] about somebody you talk to about Bitcoin
[15:04] with somebody and they're looking at you
[15:06] like they're looking at you crazy man so
[15:10] but yeah I I think that you know Bitcoin
[15:13] might get mentioned a little bit in this
[15:15] election and we're like with three weeks
[15:17] out but I think for sure the next
[15:19] election it's going to be a big
[15:20] deal absolutely really cool do you think
[15:23] that uh the election like whether Trump
[15:26] or Harris will it be do you think that
[15:28] has an actual impact on on the Bitcoin
[15:31] price nothing major I I don't think it
[15:33] matters this is this is what I think
[15:35] about politics both sides the red side
[15:38] the blue side they're both fighting for
[15:40] access to the money machine right to the
[15:42] money printer they need to work with the
[15:43] Federal Reserve so they can make up all
[15:45] these imaginary bills get them passed
[15:47] get them signed
[15:49] create um these bonds out of nowhere so
[15:53] then the FED can buy them and then that
[15:55] creates more inflation right so I think
[15:57] that's the big thing that the American
[15:59] people don't see so if me and you for
[16:02] example are running for president and I
[16:04] say if I were to say in like true terms
[16:07] I say hey if you guys vote for me I'll
[16:09] use the money printer to do X Y and Z
[16:11] and then you'll say hey if you guys vote
[16:13] for me I'll use the money printer to do
[16:15] X Y and Z and then we both collectively
[16:16] say but the money printer is going to be
[16:18] turned on therefore there's going to be
[16:20] inflation you know and if American
[16:22] people can look at it like that maybe
[16:24] we'll stop being fooled so
[16:26] easily yeah it's it's true like no
[16:28] matter who you're voting for they they
[16:30] both will continue the that fat
[16:34] system what what do you think is the the
[16:37] next step for for Bitcoin we kind of
[16:38] have like the cror now laid out with the
[16:41] Bitcoin ATF we have uh corporations now
[16:43] with with like micro strategy and a lot
[16:45] of other uh corporations in into Bitcoin
[16:48] even though it's like just in the
[16:49] beginning uh nation states yes a little
[16:53] bit with El Salvador America maybe with
[16:56] Trump uh Germany definitely not the they
[16:59] selling the
[17:01] Bitcoin are you in Germany I'm almost in
[17:04] Germany like in Austria but in Austria
[17:06] it's not better because we don't have
[17:07] any Bitcoin so we never sold yeah I
[17:11] don't know if that's better or worse
[17:12] I've been AA before actually I used to
[17:15] live in Europe so all right this is what
[17:18] I think I think what happens next is I
[17:21] think there needs to be Mass education
[17:25] right so one of the reasons why the Fiat
[17:29] system keeps going is because the people
[17:32] in the system are also the People Who
[17:34] oversee education right so if they just
[17:37] keep educating you in the same way or
[17:39] the same system saying hey this is what
[17:41] works or this is how things are supposed
[17:43] to go this is why you can get people who
[17:46] can get up to the Master's Degree level
[17:48] the PHD level of economics and still
[17:51] have no idea what the hell is going on
[17:53] you know so I think it's things like
[17:55] this podcast I think it's things like
[17:57] you know the people on social media who
[17:59] are sitting around every day educating
[18:01] people because what ends up happening is
[18:04] like I used to follow uh some some
[18:07] bitcoiners like maybe 2017 2018 they
[18:10] start off sounding like kooky people you
[18:12] know they're like yeah yeah okay bro and
[18:14] then the price goes up and not only not
[18:17] not that it's you're only in it for the
[18:19] price to go up but it kind of validates
[18:21] what they're saying you know and then
[18:23] you have things like um donation funds
[18:27] from the truckers in Canada being put on
[18:29] hold and then you have things like
[18:30] there's these things that happen in
[18:32] society that kind of lead to evidence as
[18:35] like okay maybe these orange pill people
[18:38] aren't wrong you know it's when all
[18:41] these conspiracies become coincidences
[18:43] and then you're like slowly slowly but
[18:45] surely but it's there's a a multiplier
[18:47] effect you know these things compound so
[18:50] when you have people out there who can
[18:51] create a podcast and then get you know
[18:55] let's say you do a podcast and it gets
[18:56] 10,000 views right and you're looking at
[18:58] it because you're the podcast Creator
[19:00] and you're like oh 10,000 people 5,000
[19:01] people you don't realize that people sit
[19:05] they watch it and then no one's just
[19:07] going to watch something find it
[19:08] interesting and not tell their brother
[19:09] about it or not tell their cooworker
[19:11] about it right these are conversations
[19:13] that people have every day so then those
[19:15] people are like hey like actually I was
[19:16] learning about this and then it spreads
[19:18] and it spreads and it spreads right so
[19:20] everything compounds so even when you
[19:22] think of the smallest podcast the
[19:24] Bitcoin podcast I end up finding them
[19:26] and they get 88 views and I'm like like
[19:28] man this is some good stuff right here
[19:30] you know and then I turn I talk to my
[19:32] circle friends about it and everything
[19:33] just kind of compounds so I think one of
[19:36] the major things major one of the major
[19:38] steps is the individual people right the
[19:41] individual people self-educating because
[19:44] if we're if we're going to sit back and
[19:45] wait on the system then what's going to
[19:48] happen is it's going to take forever
[19:49] we're GNA just play the Fiat game right
[19:51] it's going to take forever it needs to
[19:53] be passed by these through the school
[19:54] district which means the state needs to
[19:56] approve of it which means the people in
[19:58] the state need to approve of it the
[19:59] governor needs to approve of it but
[20:00] maybe he doesn't so now you got people
[20:02] in 23 States being educated about you
[20:05] know Bitcoin or even like the the train
[20:07] of thought from the Aus School of
[20:09] economics and then you have the other
[20:10] states that are like h no we're not
[20:12] doing that you know so I think it starts
[20:15] with uh the people in each person and
[20:19] then the the kind of the proof for the
[20:21] backbone in this this hey the system
[20:23] works is you're like hey we have these
[20:25] outlets look even black rock is you know
[20:28] all people to buy ETF or you can go to
[20:31] this company and buy it yourself you can
[20:33] self custody with these people which are
[20:35] usually just everyday people who are
[20:36] creating products you know so I think
[20:39] the work's going to be done from the
[20:41] inside out you know it's going to start
[20:42] with the orange pill people and it's
[20:44] just going to spread and spread and
[20:45] spread you know and I think that's why
[20:47] when you see um people like Jack MERS
[20:50] talking to NFL players you know very
[20:53] prominent NFL players at that you're
[20:55] like this is crazy you know like this
[20:57] guy's a leader on a professional
[20:58] football team you think he's going to go
[21:00] in the locker room and just be quiet you
[21:02] know like of course he's not and then of
[21:04] course like after the game they win
[21:06] everyone's talking and then the price of
[21:08] Bitcoin shoots up like it does today and
[21:09] they like hey man like so you took your
[21:12] contract in or you took your endorsement
[21:14] endorsements in Bitcoin huh like these
[21:16] things spread and these people have
[21:17] influence so I seen Michael sailor
[21:20] comment on Ronaldo's uh tweet yesterday
[21:22] you know and I'm like these things
[21:24] spread like crazy but it's going to
[21:26] start from the inside out I I saw that I
[21:28] saw that tweet I think Ronaldo brings
[21:29] out like watches or something like that
[21:32] like watch collection I thought like hey
[21:34] there's a Bitcoin watch collection also
[21:36] yeah and it's crazy because I was there
[21:40] I I had like a watch collection that I
[21:41] was looking at like an investment and
[21:44] what end up happening is
[21:47] um I was thinking like okay here's the
[21:49] demand for these watches right and then
[21:53] here's the supply and I'm like oh this
[21:54] is pretty cool you know every every
[21:56] watch I was buying is soon as you walk
[21:58] out of Rolex is up 40% or Vashon or
[22:01] whatever you know you're up 40 50% and
[22:04] then at a moment's notice they just snap
[22:06] their fingers boom more Supply you know
[22:09] and you're like this is a Fiat game this
[22:11] is a Fiat game that you're trying to
[22:13] play and it goes to to show that like
[22:16] the inability to save your you know your
[22:20] time and your and your energy which is
[22:22] you know your money it leads you to
[22:25] gambling and that's how I start looking
[22:27] at my my former self like man that was
[22:29] gamble that that's so interesting yeah
[22:30] it's also um this all for kind of
[22:33] connects like the the education system
[22:36] is really bad but now we're getting a
[22:38] new like decentralized education system
[22:41] with social media with the podcast with
[22:43] all those things then we have like this
[22:45] inflation this N9 to5 red race which
[22:47] also gets better with Bitcoin and online
[22:49] education uh it's kind of all connected
[22:52] for me and and and I kind of like I feel
[22:55] like we entering in a new world era
[22:58] where uh people are way more free if
[23:01] they really want to like it's now on
[23:03] everyone's mind like if you can afford a
[23:06] phone you don't have an excuse anymore
[23:09] like if you own on an interconnection is
[23:10] like almost everything you need to like
[23:12] conquer the world these days it's it's
[23:14] crazy to think about that but I love the
[23:17] implications uh of that and I love how
[23:20] you also explain that yeah the the
[23:23] education matters a lot because that's
[23:25] what gets people to hold when you know
[23:28] or to hdle when it goes down that's what
[23:30] gets people to buy in when it goes down
[23:32] it's when people are afraid to buy the
[23:34] dip is because they don't have a very
[23:35] thorough understanding right they don't
[23:38] have a thorough understanding of how
[23:40] this system works or how Bitcoin works
[23:42] or why this thing is valuable so they're
[23:43] like ah it's going down maybe you know
[23:45] their paper hands or maybe they buy more
[23:47] but it's all from education right and I
[23:52] was making a joke yesterday that like
[23:54] the richest people in the history of the
[23:56] world couldn't do this is last night at
[23:58] dinner I'm like couldn't do what I'm
[23:59] doing right now which is I was eating
[24:01] crab legs and watching YouTube right and
[24:03] I'm like John D Rockefeller couldn't do
[24:05] this right like manam Musa couldn't get
[24:08] crab legs right here and sit and have
[24:11] someone who he does not know and just
[24:14] sit here and educate him on something
[24:15] you know you're like this is what's cool
[24:17] like the technology has empowered
[24:19] everybody but it's on the individual
[24:21] person to actually like apply it you
[24:23] know to reach out and you you build your
[24:26] own like ecosystem on the internet the
[24:28] people follow it's really like you
[24:29] versus your attention span at this
[24:32] point yeah it's like the the average
[24:34] person in 204 is way richer than the
[24:37] richest sky like a few hundred years ago
[24:40] yeah I'm like man you could have been as
[24:42] rich as you want to but you didn't have
[24:45] Plumbing like this is a cool time to
[24:47] live in you know I have Plumbing I have
[24:49] air conditioning people gather crabs for
[24:52] me to eat and I get to sit and watch
[24:54] some guy across the world talk about you
[24:56] know this magic internet money I I like
[24:58] my life you know it's pretty cool what a
[25:02] time to be alive really cool um what do
[25:05] you think primed you to understand
[25:07] Bitcoin because I feel like uh even like
[25:10] there are a lot of Rich dudes a lot of
[25:12] smart dudes that have no clue about
[25:14] Bitcoin uh and it's just like a very
[25:17] small group of people that actually
[25:19] understand in crass Bitcoin right now
[25:21] what do you think Prime you to to
[25:23] actually understand it all right so
[25:25] before I had any type of like real money
[25:28] like
[25:29] I was paying attention to bitcoin right
[25:31] so my first Bitcoin buy was in 2017 and
[25:34] it was strictly for the purpose of
[25:36] trying to make more money right so me
[25:38] and my cousin Johnny were just like
[25:41] halfway reading these books halfway kind
[25:43] of paying attention you know but we're
[25:45] just like we want the number to go up
[25:46] you know so I'm thinking I'm some mad
[25:49] scientist and I buy at 3,000 sell at
[25:52] 6,000 I think I'm the king of the world
[25:54] it goes up to 20,000 and then I'm
[25:57] sitting here looking at my cousin I'm
[25:58] like bro what did we do wrong you know
[26:00] so then it crashes and then I'm like
[26:03] well I guess I did that right you know I
[26:06] didn't I didn't miss out so then what
[26:08] end up happening is like
[26:10] 2019 I'm like buying in as I'm starting
[26:12] making more money I'm buying in I would
[26:14] like I'd buy a whole coin for $4,000
[26:16] sell it for $7,000 or buy it for eight
[26:18] and sell it for 12 and I'm just thinking
[26:20] I'm like thinking like a Trader you know
[26:23] but how the Sega goes like you come you
[26:26] come for the number go up and you stay
[26:28] for the revolution you know so then what
[26:30] would happen is I would start following
[26:32] traders who would like trade Bitcoin and
[26:34] you know I'm like all right this is
[26:35] pretty cool you know and then I started
[26:39] to find like uh people who were like
[26:42] very deeply into this you know like
[26:44] Naval for example right so you you know
[26:48] and follow Naval Nal actually not
[26:53] oh maybe I know him from like profile
[26:55] but this name uh doesn't ring a bell now
[26:58] I'll I'll send you his profile he's some
[27:00] profound guy but he's a he's a a um a
[27:03] angel investor in Silicone Valley but
[27:05] he's also like a philosopher right so I
[27:08] would like listen to some of the the um
[27:10] podcast and stuff he would do and he
[27:12] would talk about like the impact of
[27:13] crypto currency and things like that and
[27:16] then I'm like oh this is crazy and you
[27:19] know who he is now I I know and I
[27:21] Googled him yeah I know this guy Nal
[27:24] ravikant yep so as I'm like listening to
[27:28] him and then like you know he would say
[27:30] little things like he has this old tweet
[27:32] that would say like um like basically
[27:35] you you're either left to play The
[27:38] Wealth game or the status game right so
[27:40] the status game is you know where you
[27:42] went to school kind of car you drive the
[27:43] jewelry you wear like who you hang out
[27:45] where you hang out with like that right
[27:47] or you can choose to play The Wealth
[27:49] game and the wealth game is how long can
[27:50] you survive without another paycheck so
[27:52] he said that and I'm like whoa like you
[27:55] know that's actually deep so I start
[27:56] paying attention to him start listening
[27:59] and then he kind of led me down this
[28:00] rabbit hole and I'm like man what okay
[28:02] why are these people buying Bitcoin and
[28:03] saying they're never going to sell when
[28:05] I'm just turning a profit like you know
[28:07] every few months so I started kind of
[28:09] paying attention and I'm like okay this
[28:11] is something that you can hold so then
[28:13] what happened is during covid when they
[28:17] printed off all that money I already
[28:19] understood the impact of it you know
[28:20] what I'm like oh this is why people are
[28:24] like it's not necessarily a hedge to
[28:26] inflation but a solution to inflation
[28:29] right because at any given moment we're
[28:31] always one event away from them stroking
[28:34] the pin and now we're going to flood the
[28:36] whole global economy with more money and
[28:38] now the cost of living is going up and
[28:40] then you start to put two and two
[28:41] together like the the the price of these
[28:43] assets are going up because they're
[28:45] propped up by all the global liquidity
[28:47] you know or the M2 money supply the
[28:48] global money supply they send assets up
[28:50] they send you real estate up they
[28:52] they're what's propping you know Bitcoin
[28:54] to go to go up too you're like all this
[28:56] new money has to find a home right so if
[29:00] all this new money has to find a home
[29:01] and it's going to find a home in real
[29:03] estate well they're just going to make a
[29:04] build a house right next to yours right
[29:06] and or if you all this money finds a
[29:09] home in stocks and then the I don't know
[29:13] the company can say let's issue more
[29:14] shares so therefore you just been
[29:16] diluted right so everything like I was
[29:18] saying too about watches so everything
[29:20] that can grow like horizontally you
[29:22] could just keep making more and more of
[29:24] it you're just being slowly diluted
[29:27] although the nominal value was going up
[29:29] so then I started to really it really
[29:31] started to click like hey well if you
[29:33] can't grow this thing
[29:36] Bitcoin this way it has to grow this way
[29:39] right so that's when it started to click
[29:42] and I'm like oh okay so the more they
[29:44] pump money into the system it's going to
[29:45] benefit the holders but it's going to
[29:47] benefit them at a much higher rate than
[29:49] real estate or stocks will because you
[29:51] can't just duplicate real estate I mean
[29:54] duplicate uh Bitcoin like you could a
[29:56] stock or like real estate you know so
[29:58] you can have a nice house in a nice area
[30:00] and they'll just chop down some trees
[30:01] and build a really nice cool house next
[30:03] to you and it's just slowly diluting you
[30:06] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[30:08] a regular basis I'll guess you already
[30:11] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[30:13] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[30:16] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[30:19] personal recommendation for Hardware
[30:20] wallet is the bitb boox it's super
[30:23] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[30:40] next step is to really level up your
[30:42] sovereignty as an individual you have to

[30:59] a plan B a citizenship where you can

[31:21] not least I have something completely
[31:24] new for you guys I partnered up with
[31:27] coin vigilante this is the most
[31:30] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:33] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:35] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:38] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[31:41] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:44] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:47] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[31:51] coin Vigilant just dropped a completely
[31:53] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:57] watch collections you have the date of
[31:59] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:03] there and of course also the block
[32:05] height and which Epoch we are currently
[32:08] in I love the level of detail they put
[32:11] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[32:14] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:16] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:19] love those watches so so much absolutely
[32:24] I that's that once you realize that like
[32:26] then it's like almost game over you're
[32:28] like just like DCA all the way yeah yep
[32:32] exactly and and then I think to you get
[32:35] to a point and you're learning because I
[32:37] think naturally people who especially
[32:39] come for the ngu like they're like man
[32:41] I'm going to I can't wait for Bitcoin to
[32:43] hit this price and this price or this
[32:45] price I'm going to sell out I'm GNA buy
[32:46] this I'm gonna buy that and eventually
[32:48] when you you know on when you're on your
[32:50] journey you come to this understanding
[32:52] that like why would I sell my Bitcoin
[32:56] for dollars you know like that's a
[32:59] pretty stupid trade you know and I think
[33:01] once that hits you then you understand
[33:04] like oh this is a revolution you know
[33:06] like you you can't temp me with however
[33:08] many dollars you're going to offer me
[33:10] because I know you're gonna offer me a
[33:11] lot of money in the future for something
[33:13] that you can't control you know and the
[33:15] point is when you go to sleep at night
[33:18] you wake up you're that much more poor
[33:20] because they just put more money into
[33:22] the ecosystem and I think that's when it
[33:25] really starts to hit like oh this is way
[33:27] bigger than just building your wealth do
[33:30] you think at some point everyone will
[33:33] will will realize that with Bitcoin or
[33:36] they they just use it because they are
[33:38] group pressured into it and it's uh
[33:40] Bitcoin is just like the foundation of
[33:43] uh the the the financial system it's
[33:45] kind of like the uh tcpip protocol
[33:49] everyone uses it but nobody really
[33:51] understands it like how how do you think
[33:54] that will go with with Bitcoin yeah so I
[33:56] don't think everyone is going to look at
[33:58] it like it's a revolution I think some
[33:59] people are going to try to ride the
[34:01] train get some money sell out you know
[34:03] get a nice car get their maybe even buy
[34:05] a home which I don't think there's
[34:06] anything wrong with that at all but no I
[34:09] don't think that everyone's going to
[34:11] like understand the impact that this
[34:13] could have because because we don't
[34:15] understand the system itself right so if
[34:17] we don't understand how the IMF is
[34:19] screwing countries over or how the
[34:21] Federal Reserve is kind of like turning
[34:24] us into like tax slaves you know like if
[34:27] you don't understand that you're not
[34:28] going to understand the point of like
[34:29] holding your Bitcoin and not going back
[34:32] into that system right to sell your
[34:34] Bitcoins to go back into that system so
[34:37] uh I don't think everyone's going to
[34:39] understand that but I do think that
[34:40] there will be people who understand that
[34:42] and I also think there's going to be
[34:43] corporations who understand that as
[34:45] well yeah absolutely the the
[34:48] corporations will will be a huge wave I
[34:50] feel like in the coming years they they
[34:53] starting to really get it the these days
[34:56] um but do you think that that Bitcoin
[34:59] has the potential to to make an impact
[35:02] on society like to to to there this PO
[35:05] saying fix money fix the world is that
[35:08] actually true yeah I I think it has the
[35:11] the potential because I think it's doing
[35:12] it already like haven't haven't you
[35:15] noticed that since you like you know
[35:16] started paying attention to bitcoin you
[35:19] things just start changing right you
[35:20] start valuing things a little different
[35:22] you're like I'll put more emphasis on
[35:24] the future or you know like I I want to
[35:26] get a little more healthy you know you
[35:28] kind of just and and then it makes you
[35:30] align with people who have values that
[35:32] are similar to yours you know if I know
[35:34] somebody's a bitcoiner I kind of like
[35:36] give them the bit of the doubt like I'm
[35:38] like this person's probably cool because
[35:40] to understand what you know is going on
[35:42] you're like I know that you have to dig
[35:44] deep and uh so I think it changes people
[35:47] at the individual level but then you
[35:48] have to understand that individual
[35:50] people is what makes up companies or
[35:53] what makes up governments or what makes
[35:55] up countries you know it's the
[35:56] individual person and I think sometimes
[35:59] that we Overlook how far someone's
[36:01] impact can go so if Bitcoin can change
[36:04] me and then I change the five people
[36:06] closest to me and then they change two
[36:08] people next to them you know or look how
[36:10] impactful someone like Michael sailor
[36:12] could be you know so yeah I I think that
[36:15] it for sure could underline or undermine
[36:19] what the system that's going on and make
[36:21] people start to ask questions you know
[36:23] because how much longer can you hear
[36:25] people say that hey they keep printing
[36:27] money and this is you know causing
[36:29] inflation and how much longer can like
[36:32] let's say normies just say no that's not
[36:34] true and then it keep happening and keep
[36:36] happening keep happening you know like
[36:37] how much longer can you go on before how
[36:40] how much longer can this go on before
[36:41] people say like all right maybe you're
[36:44] right bro you know maybe you're right
[36:46] right or even like when it comes to like
[36:49] politics and you say all right they're
[36:50] telling you all these things that
[36:51] they're going to do but ask them how
[36:52] they're going to pay for it eventually
[36:55] people are going to say like you know
[36:57] what maybe you're right how are you guys
[36:58] going to pay for it they're going to
[36:59] borrow money well that's going to cause
[37:00] more inflation so I think each person
[37:04] you know uh being their own little uh uh
[37:07] Beacon will eventually change the world
[37:10] because these corporations these
[37:12] countries Nations States all these
[37:14] things are just made up of individual
[37:16] people absolutely it's so funny for me
[37:20] because when when I hear like they they
[37:23] print more money to fix inflation like
[37:25] you notice politics like inflation
[37:28] reduction act and they print a bunch of
[37:30] money to to
[37:32] go and it's and it's crazy because like
[37:35] you know when you say it to people who
[37:37] kind of aren't paying attention you kind
[37:39] of sound like a conspiracy theorist you
[37:40] know but eventually they start
[37:43] complaining about those grocery prices
[37:45] and you're like tried to tell you a few
[37:47] years ago you
[37:49] know I I feel like the pain has to to
[37:52] grow before people actually start to
[37:54] wake up and actually pay attention to it
[37:57] um
[37:58] how has uh we talked a little bit about
[38:00] time and kind of also goes into to the
[38:03] freedom um how how has your definition
[38:07] or your view at time and your value at
[38:10] time and also maybe your definition and
[38:12] value of Freedom changed with with
[38:15] Bitcoin so before Bitcoin right and I
[38:18] would say before I was like very like
[38:21] orange pilled so before this when I was
[38:24] kind of like Fiat thinking when I would
[38:26] wake up in the morning the first thing
[38:28] that would be on my mind is make more
[38:30] money right I was just strictly on a
[38:32] mission to get wealthier like what is my
[38:35] company need to do what does that
[38:36] company need to do what stocks are
[38:38] moving what stocks are under value can I
[38:40] buy what can I and all this is just to
[38:42] make more money right and then when you
[38:44] make more money you realize like I need
[38:45] to make even more money you know and
[38:48] then it's like you go up but then the
[38:50] cost of living goes up and you go up and
[38:51] the cost of living goes up right so
[38:53] you're like man like I thought maybe 10
[38:57] years ago I thought that maybe if I had
[39:00] x amount of money I would just feel
[39:01] comfortable but you can't because that
[39:03] thing is chasing you which is inflation
[39:04] is chasing you right so all my time was
[39:07] just going to like growing businesses
[39:10] and making more money so then after
[39:14] Bitcoin what ends up happening is I
[39:15] started looking at my time like okay I
[39:18] want to spend my time learning I want to
[39:20] spend my time with my children I want to
[39:21] spend my time doing all these things
[39:23] that have nothing to do with making
[39:25] money and I can do that as as long as my
[39:29] savings account isn't just deflating
[39:32] right so as long as my savings account
[39:33] isn't deflating then I'm like okay cool
[39:36] I don't feel the pressure anymore you
[39:38] know this morning I was going to Tweet
[39:40] it which I'll probably tweet it tomorrow
[39:41] but I was going to say like you know I
[39:42] used to wake up in the morning and look
[39:44] for stocks to trade and now I just go
[39:45] water my grass you know like I don't
[39:48] feel the pressure anymore now on top of
[39:51] not feeling the pressure anymore it just
[39:53] makes me think like longer term you know
[39:56] like I know Bitcoin will get to where
[39:58] it's going to get eventually I'm just
[40:00] going to focus on what's in front of me
[40:01] you know and stack SATs that's it so
[40:04] whenever I get some fi I'll sell it in
[40:06] exchange for some STS and then I'm going
[40:08] to do the things that I like to do I
[40:11] love that so much uh before Bitcoin I
[40:14] went out and the first thing I looked
[40:16] for stocks and now I wor in my grass
[40:18] that that's that's so so deep ingrain in
[40:21] the Bitcoin Community like that that
[40:23] really resonates and I have interviewed
[40:25] a lot of Bitcoin bitcoiners my
[40:28] 277th uh podcast so I'm approaching the
[40:30] 300 uh people so I kind of get to know
[40:33] like who's a bitcoiner yeah uh and
[40:36] that's so like so Char characteristic
[40:39] for a bitcoiner who was just in pursuit
[40:42] of money and found like happiness found
[40:45] like this low time preference Bitcoin
[40:47] thing and I love that so much thank you
[40:49] for sharing that it's really the journey
[40:51] it's the journey I it sounds so cliche
[40:53] but it's like it's the journey man cuz
[40:55] no one tells you to hey stop thinking
[40:58] about getting Lambos when your Bitcoin
[41:00] goes up no one tells you that you know
[41:02] you kind of naturally come to that like
[41:04] man these people are just making crap
[41:06] you know like the even the devices that
[41:08] you buy the things you buy from the
[41:10] store aren't made well anymore you know
[41:12] like everything is just real fast
[41:14] there's no quality it's just
[41:16] everything's just quantity quantity
[41:17] quantity then you start seeing that with
[41:19] people and then you're like okay well
[41:21] I'm going to spend my time with people
[41:23] who value the same things that I value
[41:25] and then I started looking at Labor that
[41:27] way way right so my original saying is
[41:29] get money by income right but that was
[41:32] kind of I started thinking that's kind
[41:33] of like Fiat because you're getting
[41:35] money to buy incom producing assets
[41:38] right and these income producing assets
[41:39] are all tied into the Fiat world so then
[41:43] I started thinking it's like you provide
[41:46] value and store value that's the that's
[41:50] the new model right like so I start
[41:53] looking at my labor different like
[41:55] there's things that I'm not willing to
[41:56] do for money like for instance talk to
[41:58] somebody or have a one-on-one
[41:59] consultation or like I don't want to you
[42:02] can't pay me to sit and hang out with
[42:04] you or to talk to you or I don't care
[42:05] about any of that stuff you know I'm
[42:07] gonna come talk to you for free if I
[42:09] want to talk to you that's it right or
[42:11] if I want to work then I'm GNA make sure
[42:13] that it's tied into love like the labor
[42:16] is things that I actually want to do you
[42:18] know like hey I want to do this thing
[42:20] because it's going to help people right
[42:22] and I just started looking at everything
[42:24] like like just slightly different you
[42:26] know so now I'm more like
[42:27] you you provide value and then you store
[42:30] your value because when you provide
[42:31] value to people they'll exchange it for
[42:32] for money and then you need to store
[42:34] your value away and we know the best
[42:36] thing to store your value in right so
[42:37] you provide Value Store value and I'm
[42:39] like man it's kind of like just change
[42:41] it changes you from the inside you
[42:44] know what do you think is is harder
[42:46] making money or like providing value or
[42:49] like keeping money and storing money
[42:51] storing money storing money that's a way
[42:55] harder game man there's 52 million
[42:57] millionaires in the entire world right
[43:00] so if you think about this there's
[43:01] probably
[43:03] like 300 people in the NBA right for
[43:06] example there's 300 3 400 people in the
[43:08] NBA right so that should tell you like
[43:10] being a professional basketball is
[43:12] exponentially harder than making a lot
[43:15] of money right so the thing is I think
[43:18] where we kind of get confused with the
[43:19] making money part is we don't understand
[43:21] that you have to go help someone else
[43:24] right so we only think about making
[43:26] money money cuz we think about what we
[43:28] want what we want what we want we what
[43:31] we want but if I told you like hey I
[43:33] have this solution for you to grow your
[43:35] podcast you know 10,000 extra listeners
[43:38] a month in exchange for $5,000 if that's
[43:41] valuable for you you'll pay me right but
[43:44] what I'm leading with is how I'm going
[43:46] to help you not what I'm going to get
[43:47] about out of it so if I wake up and say
[43:50] hey I need $5,000 because I want to go
[43:52] buy this I want to go on vacation then
[43:54] you're walking around looking for
[43:55] someone willing to give you
[43:57] ,000 but instead if you look at it like
[44:00] how can I help this person maybe this
[44:02] person needs to lose weight maybe this
[44:03] person needs to grow their their
[44:05] whatever their podcast maybe this person
[44:07] needs a new tire maybe this person needs
[44:10] their their wheels aligned on their car
[44:12] so then you start like what's valuable
[44:14] to other people how can I serve other
[44:16] people and if you get that to click what
[44:19] can I do to solve other people I mean to
[44:21] serve other people then you realize that
[44:23] you know the skill of making money is
[44:24] just solving problems and we'll never
[44:26] run run out of problems you know like
[44:28] we're humans we have all these problems
[44:30] and we'll never run out of these
[44:31] problems therefore there's always
[44:32] opportunity to help somebody in exchange
[44:35] they'll give you some money you know so
[44:37] I think the making money part it clicked
[44:40] kind of early to me the storing money
[44:42] part becomes a whole different ball game
[44:46] because like I was saying if you don't
[44:47] have something sound to store your value
[44:50] in it turns you into a gambler and the
[44:53] gambling mentality is hard to get out of
[44:56] and a lot of times
[44:57] you think you're investing but you're
[44:59] really gambling right or you think
[45:01] you're trading but you're really
[45:01] gambling right so for instance I traded
[45:05] crypto stocks bet on Sports all these
[45:08] things so I'll give you the analogy of
[45:11] like betting on sports right when you
[45:13] bet on Sports two teams are playing
[45:15] against each other one of them has to
[45:16] win
[45:18] right you go buy a stock that you think
[45:22] is providing value but there's all
[45:25] these um moving components in the
[45:28] background that you don't even
[45:29] understand are there you're not privy to
[45:31] that information right so although it
[45:34] sounds a lot better like well I'm going
[45:36] to invest in this stock and you're like
[45:38] you don't realize you don't have enough
[45:40] information to make a solid decision
[45:41] therefore you're gambling right so I
[45:43] started thinking about it like this or
[45:45] you know you go put your money in some
[45:48] crypto token because it's supposed to go
[45:49] up and then it tanks and then you
[45:51] realize one day that some developer who
[45:54] developed this token also developed this
[45:56] other Tok and then they paid some
[45:57] influencer to put in front of your face
[45:59] and you became a victim to the algorithm
[46:02] that was gambling right so when you
[46:04] don't have a solid place to store the
[46:06] value that you've created you start
[46:09] gambling right so whether you're you
[46:12] know sports betting or whether you're
[46:14] trading stocks or trading shitcoins or
[46:16] all these things even you know investing
[46:19] in watches like you're like man those
[46:20] materials can be made very easy you know
[46:24] so or flipping real estate all these
[46:26] things they start start to sound or seem
[46:28] like gambling to you when you kind of
[46:31] understand what's going on you know so
[46:33] then not not that there's anything wrong
[46:35] with taking calculated risk but it makes
[46:37] you realize that
[46:39] okay I see my Bitcoin as a savings
[46:42] account right I bought some micro
[46:44] strategy the other day I see that as an
[46:47] investment right so it's like
[46:51] 99.8% of my savings account sitting in
[46:53] this thing I want to speculate a little
[46:55] bit with this company here's an
[46:57] investment versus the Fiat way to do
[47:00] this would be 99% of my money is
[47:03] invested into these companies and I have
[47:05] a little bit saved you know just in case
[47:08] because I have to absolutely get
[47:10] wealthier you know so it just swaps
[47:12] everything around for you and then you
[47:13] can just sit down and
[47:15] chill I I love that perspective so much
[47:19] really really cool and this this this s
[47:21] moment where like oh I just store my
[47:25] financial energy in Bitcoin this this
[47:27] really brings something and it allows
[47:29] you to really focus on just providing
[47:31] value for other people uh kind of the
[47:33] origin story of this podcast kind of um
[47:35] yeah really cool one last thing before
[47:37] we get to the end routine that I really
[47:39] want to get into with you um being that
[47:42] discipline and being like Oh like I know
[47:45] where Bitcoin is going there's like two
[47:47] factors that really keep like people
[47:50] engaged with Bitcoin the first fact is
[47:52] always like the price especially for for
[47:54] newbies like the the price taret like in
[47:57] 10 years time we will get there and then
[48:00] only in the second order they actually
[48:02] think of like oh like why Bitcoin and
[48:05] what are the educational values of that
[48:07] and and why is it so valuable for for us
[48:11] uh do you have for the first thing
[48:13] especially for the newb um um models or
[48:16] like what do you think of of price
[48:18] models for for Bitcoin where it's going
[48:20] do in the long term or are you just like
[48:23] oh I I love the fundamentals and I just
[48:26] know my money will be saved there how do
[48:29] you look at that so all right this is
[48:32] the way I think about the price right so
[48:33] I used to think like all right when
[48:34] Bitcoin goes to this price I'm going to
[48:36] have X amount of money and then I
[48:38] started realizing like okay if I sell my
[48:42] Fiat right now because that's what you
[48:43] do when you buy your Bitcoin you're
[48:45] selling your Fiat right if I sell my
[48:46] Fiat I know my money isn't being stolen
[48:49] from me right so I started looking at it
[48:52] like that like that's why I'm now I'm
[48:54] willing to buy Bitcoin at higher price
[48:57] right so when it goes up I'll buy it
[48:58] when it goes down buy it when it stays
[48:59] in the middle I'll buy it because I'm
[49:01] like I need to get rid of this thing
[49:03] that's allowing people to steal my time
[49:07] and if I value my time why would I let
[49:09] someone steal it right so that's the way
[49:11] that I look at it now I'm like well if I
[49:14] keep this money sitting here and every
[49:16] day the money printer is going bur so I
[49:18] know I'm getting poor I know they're
[49:20] stealing from me so the one thing that I
[49:23] say is um like Bitcoin might go up and
[49:25] down up and down on its way up but
[49:26] fiat's going down only right it's going
[49:30] straight down it's the roller coaster
[49:31] straight down and then when you get to
[49:32] the bottom of that pit you're going to
[49:34] wish you jumped off of that roller
[49:37] coaster onto something else just to give
[49:38] yourself some type of Fighting Chance
[49:40] because you have no fighting chance with
[49:42] you know your fiat currency especially
[49:44] like well let's say like I'm American so
[49:46] the dollar right you know where the
[49:48] Dollar's going because when you grew up
[49:49] a can of soda was 25 cents now it's
[49:52] $1.70 you know and the soda didn't get
[49:54] any it didn't taste any better doesn't
[49:56] make happier doesn't do anything you
[49:58] know doesn't do anything special except
[50:00] the price went up so one you have to
[50:02] give yourself a fighting chance and to
[50:04] give yourself a Fighting Chance you got
[50:05] to dump the Fiat so I started looking at
[50:08] it like
[50:09] that I I love the way that that you look
[50:11] at it like the that that makes a lot of
[50:13] sense really really cool um we have one
[50:15] question always uh for every guest um
[50:18] the question is always the same one what
[50:20] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[50:23] how to spend your time how to spend your
[50:26] time right like so my version of the
[50:31] American dream and I know a lot of
[50:32] Europeans share this dream but it's
[50:35] you're financially free right which
[50:37] means you can spend you know on the
[50:39] things that you actually care about and
[50:42] you can earn as much as you want you
[50:43] know there's no limits then you have
[50:45] your time Freedom right and that's the
[50:47] freedom to do what you want to do when
[50:49] you want to do it and then the third
[50:51] part is your location Freedom you can go
[50:53] where you want to go stay as long as you
[50:55] want to stay right
[50:57] so I think like I said when we started
[51:00] this podcast how you spend your time
[51:02] says a lot about yourself right and how
[51:05] you spend your money will dictate how
[51:07] you spend your time because if you tie
[51:08] all your money into buying things that
[51:11] let's say financing cars or spending on
[51:13] credit cards then you have to spend your
[51:14] time to pay those things off right so
[51:17] those two are very very very correlated
[51:20] right so besides Bitcoin to put time at
[51:23] the very very Forefront of what's
[51:27] valuable to you right so if you go work
[51:30] all day and then you decide like hey I'm
[51:32] going to go to the mall and buy X Y and
[51:34] Z well you just disrespected the time
[51:36] that you put in to get the money right
[51:39] so that is one and then two the other
[51:42] part which I attribute a lot of you know
[51:44] to where I've come from and where I'm at
[51:47] I attribute a lot of it to curiosity
[51:49] right so I would say to stay curious
[51:52] about life to stay curious about the
[51:53] world and to always learn something you
[51:56] know like always always always you know
[51:59] keep a book open keep podcast like
[52:00] question everything you know I remember
[52:02] being 10 years old and just having crazy
[52:04] amounts of questions from my mom and she
[52:06] like boy shut up you know like I asked
[52:08] too many questions but that curiosity is
[52:10] what allows you to kind of like
[52:12] challenge what you think you know and
[52:14] that's where you start making your
[52:15] progress you know so stay curious even
[52:17] if it's not money related like you like
[52:20] the other day on Twitter everyone's
[52:21] going crazy about whatever it was they
[52:23] were going crazy about and I followed
[52:24] the science page and they were showing
[52:26] they exact place where they found how
[52:29] leaves Breathe Right like leaves take
[52:32] breaths like like a lung it opens and it
[52:34] closes and I'm like this is the most
[52:36] intriguing thing ever and but the
[52:38] algorithm has stole everyone's attention
[52:40] so they care about this story unless
[52:42] they're like bro you don't care about
[52:43] how like you know these leaves are like
[52:46] I don't know so it's but it's just
[52:48] curiosity man it's just curiosity and
[52:50] curiosity would take you far and my
[52:52] curiosity to like how the world works
[52:54] and how money works and why we have to
[52:56] get up and leave our homes to go to work
[52:59] you know and why we stay stuck in that
[53:00] track it's just curiosity it was
[53:02] curiosity that that led me here so how
[53:05] you spend your time and to stay curious
[53:07] those are the main things I I love that
[53:09] a lot really really cool I think if if
[53:12] everyone tomorrow starts to Value their
[53:14] time and be curious they would we would
[53:17] have all a lot of people that would quit
[53:20] their job and and would would try to do
[53:22] something else yeah or or maybe you you
[53:25] don't quit your job but maybe you see
[53:26] your job as like a stepping stone you
[53:29] know and if you see your your job as a
[53:31] stepping stone I'm willing to bet you'd
[53:34] be willing to go harder you know so you
[53:37] can work and do things you love right
[53:39] but not everyone's in that position some
[53:41] people have to do it because they have
[53:43] to do it right but if you say all right
[53:45] well if I put in 48 months here right
[53:49] and then I have enough money to do this
[53:52] or do that or whatever you go hard
[53:53] because you realize like hey those 48
[53:55] months I need to make make as much money
[53:57] as possible so now let me look for
[53:58] opportunities to help this organization
[54:00] so I can get a promotion I know this is
[54:02] only 48 months so let me go harder you
[54:04] know so when you have no respect for
[54:08] your time you don't care about like hey
[54:10] I'm sitting around at this job I don't
[54:11] really do much but they pay me to do
[54:13] nothing and you're like well they're
[54:14] wasting your time and you're wasting
[54:15] your time you know so you put some more
[54:18] respect on your time and you know you
[54:20] demand better from yourself then even if
[54:23] you're doing those jobs you don't want
[54:24] to do you do it like and this is you
[54:26] know a building block so I can just you
[54:28] know Brick by Brick I can build
[54:29] something up very true really really
[54:31] cool uh I love that um we have entertain
[54:33] in the podcast where the previous guest
[54:35] is asking a question for the next guest
[54:37] without knowing who the next guest
[54:38] actually is and the question for you
[54:41] from the previous guest is if Bitcoin
[54:43] went to a million dollar what would you
[54:46] treat yourself probably go buy a car
[54:48] from the 60s but with my
[54:51] Fiat that a lot of ice cream that's it I
[54:55] just want an old school car and probably
[54:56] some ice cream and some crab legs and
[54:58] I'll be all
[54:59] right but I like to do it to say like I
[55:02] told you you know like I I'd go start
[55:03] bringing up all my old tweets like yeah
[55:06] you should have listened or sometimes
[55:08] what I do is uh uh when people troll
[55:11] like let's say when I was buying Bitcoin
[55:13] when it crashed down to 15,000 and
[55:14] people go oh you threw your money away I
[55:16] just go leave them a winky face you know
[55:18] like like four years later I have a
[55:21] response for you now you know cuz only
[55:22] time will tell you'll be judged you'll
[55:24] be judged by your work in the future you
[55:26] you know not today the things that I say
[55:28] today might not make sense for a few
[55:29] years the podcast you have the episodes
[55:32] you have the concepts that you talk
[55:33] about it might not make sense to people
[55:35] right now you know you might not have
[55:38] the best podcast until 30 years you know
[55:41] 30 years they'll go back and they say oh
[55:43] my goodness these people were on to it
[55:44] you know that's how I feel about cyppher
[55:46] punks right now I'm like whoa these guys
[55:48] were laying the foundation for Satoshi
[55:50] if he wasn't one of them which I'm sure
[55:52] he was but like this is crazy like this
[55:54] is you know 10 years before before
[55:56] Bitcoin was created there were people
[55:58] out there who were interested in
[56:00] cryptography and you know using
[56:02] technology as a way to free people so
