[00:00] There's no other solution to me. I seen
[00:03] as a musician, I saw the vinyl become a
[00:06] CD, the CD become digital. The same
[00:08] thing happened with the movies, the TV.
[00:10] We we started streaming on the phones.
[00:12] We have everything digital. Why not
[00:15] money? People is going to look for a
[00:16] solution because I did it when I left
[00:18] Argentina looking for a different
[00:20] solution. Right now, we are in that
[00:22] moment where the government is trying to
[00:24] get a grip on Bitcoin. I believe at some
[00:27] point they'll break something. It's not
[00:29] going to be Bitcoin, but they're going
[00:30] to break something because they're
[00:32] playing with fire. I call it proof of
[00:34] work. I learned at a very early age, uh,
[00:37] you don't own anything that you don't
[00:39] understand. So, I think I already took
[00:41] my leap of faith by getting on a plane
[00:44] and and changing location, which makes
[00:47] the big journey pretty easy, I will say.
[00:55] you told me you you've you you grew up
[00:57] in uh Argentina. Is is that right? Yeah,
[01:01] that's me. That's that's where
[01:03] everything started. Uh and I moved to
[01:06] the States uh in
[01:09] 2006. Uh I've been a musician all my
[01:11] life. So I was a musician in Argentina.
[01:14] uh started listening to rock bands,
[01:17] jazz, uh wanted to come and study music
[01:21] and uh my career took me here. Never
[01:24] went back after that. So you learned
[01:27] about the
[01:29] inflationary monetary system in the
[01:31] worst possible way at firsthand.
[01:35] Basically, most most people that that
[01:37] tell stories from Argentina talk about
[01:40] 2001 and and how everything blew up and
[01:43] everything, but I was born in the 80s,
[01:46] so I live a couple of those. So, it's uh
[01:50] it wasn't the first time. Uh
[01:52] unfortunately, it wasn't the last one
[01:54] either. How how was that actually living
[01:56] through those inflationary periods for
[01:59] you in Argentina especially like you
[02:01] lived up in in the 80s so you you
[02:02] actually were already working and stuff
[02:04] like that in in Argentina when you live
[02:07] through that? Well uh it was a big
[02:10] change actually. My my family were were
[02:13] uh were uh all entrepreneurs and they
[02:16] were uh building everything. Uh
[02:19] Argentina tends to have like a 10 year
[02:21] cycle before everything blows up. So uh
[02:25] inflationary wise no. So I saw my dad
[02:30] build uh from zero everything and then
[02:33] one day uh the government decide to
[02:35] change everything at two three zeros
[02:39] uh to the dollar value uh and coming
[02:44] home and saying like now all our
[02:46] expenses are 10 times more expensive
[02:49] basically. So, uh, it was the first
[02:51] change, uh, having to move from all the
[02:54] high high quality stuff into like middle
[02:57] class and then in 2001 from middle class
[03:00] to like we're going to have to do
[03:02] something about it because a a second
[03:05] uh, dilution of purchasing power in my
[03:07] house was like we're we're done. We're
[03:10] going to start again. Wait, so you
[03:11] actually were uh in a higher class and
[03:15] you got down because of in inflation
[03:17] because the value was just eroded. That
[03:20] has to that has to be so cruel. It is.
[03:23] It is. It is. It changed everything. I
[03:26] remember going to school and and having
[03:28] like a mortgage of where you will be
[03:31] like equal to $500 a month today. And uh
[03:35] overnight uh my dad came sitting the
[03:38] table and said, "Well, our mortgage just
[03:41] turned to like 5,000, so we can't afford
[03:44] it." Uh and you start doing your switch.
[03:46] You start finding out ways. And then you
[03:48] finally accommodate, start the new life,
[03:51] build, which is how everyone lives in
[03:54] Argentina. We accommodate to everything
[03:56] that happens. Uh and then 2001 happened
[04:00] and it's like, okay, now it went to like
[04:02] 50,000. So it's like we got to start
[04:05] again. Uh and everything uh it's a
[04:08] constant change. So as even choosing a
[04:11] career as a musician, you had to learn
[04:13] how to be a financial person otherwise
[04:16] you can't make it to the end of the
[04:17] month. Uh which is when I got here and I
[04:21] started like learning how actually money
[04:23] works and everything. I was like I wish
[04:25] I would have known this like 20 years
[04:27] ago and save my entire family from all
[04:30] the pain.
[04:32] How did Bitcoin came into the picture?
[04:36] Uh it was pretty much that it was
[04:38] arriving to the US uh finding my place,
[04:42] my work. Uh and as you start uh working
[04:46] you start seeing that you have to add
[04:48] hours hours always planning for the
[04:51] retirement for the vacation or whatever
[04:53] you're going to do and it's never
[04:55] enough. So eventually I started looking
[04:59] uh into learning how to train, how to uh
[05:04] do uh after hour work besides being a
[05:08] musician allows me to have some free
[05:10] time. Uh not much but uh it was about
[05:14] trying to find these new ways.
[05:16] And the first time I saw Bitcoin uh I
[05:20] remember it was about 200
[05:23] uh it was about 2010 or so and
[05:26] disregarded because I was too busy in
[05:29] the fiat world. Uh then he came to start
[05:33] uh learning a little more. Uh I saw the
[05:36] blog site word got completely scared and
[05:38] ran away. It was like these people is
[05:40] going to blow up everything. So I didn't
[05:42] give it a second shot. And then the
[05:44] third time I remember a friend coming to
[05:47] me and saying, "I found these. You
[05:49] should pay more attention." Uh so I
[05:52] started seeing Bitcoin from from uh the
[05:56] sidelines. And once I
[06:00] uh did my first small purchase, you got
[06:03] to say, and uh you disregard it and then
[06:06] one day you look at the number and it's
[06:08] like, okay, there's something here that
[06:10] I need to study more. the the number go
[06:12] up technology uh basically intrigued
[06:16] intrigued us so many. Yes.
[06:20] It's super interesting how how people
[06:22] learn about uh Bitcoin. How how has this
[06:25] impacted uh your life and your business
[06:28] decision? Oh, it's it's it's been
[06:31] incredible. I I as soon as I started
[06:33] learning the Bitcoin, I I can avoid
[06:36] uh reading. every time someone uh
[06:39] presents something to me, I go and do a
[06:41] lot of research. So, uh as soon as I
[06:44] learn about Bitcoin uh and and how it
[06:48] was working uh for other people, I
[06:50] started learning uh and I remember
[06:53] following a lot of people uh online and
[06:55] learning about videos and at some point
[06:58] I discovered the ship queens like
[07:00] everyone else. Uh and I was like, "Oh,
[07:03] this might be a faster way." Uh, and I
[07:06] went and talked to a lot of OG
[07:08] Bitcoiners and uh, they all came to me
[07:11] saying like this is not the way. Uh, and
[07:13] I got so upset that I said I'm going to
[07:15] study this and I'm going to prove them
[07:16] wrong. Uh, and I started down going down
[07:19] the rabbit hole. Never came back from
[07:22] there because nobody does.
[07:24] And once that happened
[07:28] uh my life became around Bitcoin and my
[07:31] business started like uh becoming part
[07:36] of the proof of work thing. I couldn't
[07:37] work anymore to make money. I had to
[07:40] start providing a service. It came
[07:44] naturally to me to uh that honesty and
[07:47] that uh service lifestyle that Bitcoin
[07:50] provides uh to
[07:53] start using that towards my business
[07:56] instead of trying to make money of it.
[07:59] And somehow I found myself couple of
[08:02] years later working very minimal hours,
[08:05] enjoying life with the family, uh being
[08:09] eating healthier, you know, uh
[08:11] everything that comes with the going
[08:14] down the rabbit hole. How did this So,
[08:17] but you're not retired yet. So with
[08:20] Bitcoin, I'm I'm a musician, so I don't
[08:23] think I ever going to be retired from
[08:24] that because if you give me a guitar, I
[08:26] probably will be playing for free
[08:28] everywhere. Uh but I can I can say that
[08:31] I have I have a lot of free time uh to
[08:35] enjoy life with the family and and the
[08:38] loved ones. Uh, and I'm planning to
[08:41] eventually not have to
[08:44] uh call clients, you know, the people
[08:47] that I play for, but just do it uh for
[08:50] fun. Uh, but it's coming. It's coming
[08:53] super fast uh faster than I expected. My
[08:57] main goal was to not have to uh worry in
[09:00] my business. When I talk to a client, I
[09:02] actually can service them and I don't
[09:04] have to convince them to give me money
[09:05] because I need it. that that is that was
[09:08] my main goal that is happening. Uh and
[09:11] it's what I tell everyone every time
[09:13] they ask me how is Bitcoin impacting
[09:16] your business and everything. Well, it's
[09:18] it's a
[09:19] business but it's no longer a
[09:22] job and I really enjoy connecting with
[09:26] the people that I work with.
[09:29] That's super interesting. Um because
[09:31] Bitcoin provides that financial
[09:35] um that financial security that then
[09:40] lets you do what you actually like to
[09:42] do, spending time with your family,
[09:44] playing music, whatever it is. Uh maybe
[09:47] for other people it's it's something
[09:49] completely different. And this security
[09:52] only makes that possible. And I think
[09:54] that's also what I mean with retirement.
[09:58] And retirement is not I don't know like
[10:00] sitting on the couch and don't doing any
[10:02] anything because then you can also just
[10:05] die like you're just laying around like
[10:07] you can also die because they you're
[10:09] also just laying around. Um but
[10:12] retirement for me is
[10:14] more you don't have to do anything for
[10:18] anyone anymore but you can do and you
[10:20] it's more of a financial freedom uh
[10:23] thing. So it it it feels to me like you
[10:26] already achieved that to a certain uh
[10:29] extent. Yes. Uh it was uh I always I I
[10:33] always had my dream job. So I can I can
[10:38] say that uh uh Bitcoin allowed me to do
[10:40] that because I was doing whether I had
[10:42] the money or not. Uh but what I can say
[10:46] is like the the the peace of mind, the
[10:48] being able to go to sleep and and know
[10:50] that everything is okay. uh not have to
[10:53] worry. Uh being being in Argentina was a
[10:57] constant uh uh relearning things in
[10:59] order to make it to the end of the
[11:01] month. Uh you live paycheck to paycheck
[11:03] unless uh you scam that you know uh
[11:07] someone or or or really play outside of
[11:10] the of the government currency. And once
[11:13] you come into the state uh you start
[11:16] seeing those different possibilities
[11:18] that living in the country where you
[11:20] print the dollars gives you. But somehow
[11:24] you end up in the same race. Uh when
[11:28] when Bitcoin shows up and you start like
[11:31] understanding how it works or at least
[11:34] that was for me. Uh when I see how it
[11:36] how it works, what it can do, uh my
[11:39] confidence grows every day. I spend most
[11:42] of my time uh learning from those who
[11:45] walked the path before. Um so for me
[11:50] became something that it it's it it I
[11:54] could build on that and I could build
[11:57] the future and I could think as
[11:59] retirement as being
[12:03] uh living in a world where I can
[12:05] accompany uh uh my family, my loved
[12:08] ones. And when I speak about Bitcoin, I
[12:10] I can actually show I don't have to talk
[12:13] because I read a book or everything.
[12:14] It's like look, this is what it does for
[12:16] me. This is how I believe it can help
[12:19] you. Why do
[12:20] you where do you get the confidence uh
[12:23] from a like I I see a lot of uh like in
[12:27] the podcast bubble we are all very
[12:29] confident and we we got our knowledge
[12:31] but we have to always remember we are
[12:33] like like a very small group of people
[12:36] within Bitcoin. Actually, most
[12:38] Bitcoiners are very scared when the
[12:41] Bitcoin price goes down. Uh because most
[12:43] Bitcoiners haven't done the the
[12:45] research. When I talk about most Bitcoin
[12:47] is like this, this 200 300 million
[12:49] Bitcoiners out there or maybe more,
[12:51] maybe 400, 500 million uh that have some
[12:55] capacity uh of of Bitcoin. Um only like
[13:00] a million Bitcoiners actually understand
[13:02] it truly and are not freaked out when
[13:04] the Bitcoin price goes 50% down or up.
[13:07] Where's your confidence coming from and
[13:09] and what did you had to learn and and
[13:10] and why is making why is it making so
[13:12] much sense for you? Uh I I call it proof
[13:16] of work. I put the hours. I I learn at a
[13:20] very early age. Uh you don't own
[13:23] anything that you don't understand. Uh I
[13:26] used to have a music teacher that tells
[13:27] me if you cannot explain it to me uh
[13:30] like if I was a five years old, you
[13:32] don't understand it. Uh so for me it's
[13:36] always been about putting the hours and
[13:39] and studying the history. Uh I I always
[13:44] say that it's not much my confidence in
[13:47] Bitcoin but it's my confidence in what I
[13:49] can build. Uh so it doesn't really
[13:52] matter uh what's happening around. It's
[13:55] me at the end of the day. And I when I
[13:58] see the movements in price and
[14:00] everything. Yes, at the beginning I was
[14:02] scared because it's a new thing and and
[14:05] you have to learn uh how to deal with
[14:07] this. And unfortunately there's a lot of
[14:09] podcast that that provide a lot of
[14:11] information but there's a lot of people
[14:12] that also likes to uh uh capitalize on
[14:15] the on the fear and those are the ones
[14:18] that I try to stay away from. Uh but
[14:21] when I when I see those uh changes in
[14:24] the price and everything, it got me to
[14:26] study more Bitcoin, which eventually got
[14:28] me to study more fiat money and I
[14:31] started seeing the actual risks on the
[14:33] fiat money. And when I see that and I
[14:37] compare it to something that I can uh uh
[14:39] check 24/7 and see what's going on and
[14:44] understand where is it coming from,
[14:46] where is it feeds from, where where all
[14:50] the liquidity that Bitcoin receives
[14:53] comes from. Uh and and the people that
[14:56] is coming from, what are they looking
[14:57] for and all that, it's it makes me super
[15:00] confident because there's no other
[15:03] solution to me. I seen uh as a musician
[15:06] I saw the vinyl uh become a CD, the CD
[15:10] become digital, you know. Uh the same
[15:12] thing happened with the movies. Uh the
[15:15] TV, we we started streaming on the
[15:17] phones. Uh we have everything digital,
[15:20] why not money? uh and when I see what
[15:25] happens to this uh uh government
[15:29] controlling all the situation
[15:31] uh there's no other path for me uh that
[15:36] I see that people is going to look for a
[15:38] solution because I did it when I left
[15:40] Argentina looking for a different
[15:42] solution. So I think I already took my
[15:45] leap of faith by getting on a plane and
[15:48] and changing location which makes the
[15:51] Bitcoin journey pretty easy I will say
[15:55] but it still was scary in the beginning.
[15:57] I I I do understand that uh and it's
[16:00] it's scary for a long time. I've I have
[16:03] a multiple set of question but the first
[16:05] one is is super interesting because you
[16:07] said something that is I think very true
[16:09] uh and I like that a lot. uh you said
[16:11] like if you cannot explain it to a
[16:13] 5-year-old, you actually didn't
[16:14] understand it. Uh and there are a lot of
[16:17] people in finance, there are a lot of
[16:19] people uh in a lot of different
[16:21] industries that try to uh persuade you
[16:26] that he's really clever with using a lot
[16:30] of complicated words
[16:33] uh and breaking it down to the simplest
[16:36] possible thing that it actually is makes
[16:39] the most sense. And then you can
[16:41] actually prove that you actually
[16:42] understood it. And now I I'm just
[16:45] curious because you mentioned it. How
[16:48] would you explain Bitcoin to a
[16:50] 5-year-old? Because I think it's a very
[16:51] difficult task to do. Well, it's it's
[16:56] for what I do most of the time is I
[16:59] check with people around me. If I if if
[17:03] it doesn't work, then I have to switch
[17:05] the way I'm talking to. I play a lot of
[17:08] video games all my life. Uh so
[17:10] understanding collecting coins and
[17:12] exchanging it for thing in in the
[17:15] digital world it's very easy. Uh you
[17:19] have to add the fact that uh when you
[17:22] play the video games you cannot take the
[17:24] coins with you to another game. Uh so
[17:26] all your work done in that video game
[17:29] stays there and you got you have to
[17:31] start on the next one. Even if it's the
[17:33] same series, you still don't have uh
[17:36] those skins, those coins, those
[17:38] everything. Once uh for me, Bitcoin it
[17:41] was that at the beginning it was this is
[17:43] something that I can earn and I can take
[17:47] it around and use it at all times. Uh no
[17:50] one can touch it. I can I can check it
[17:53] uh uh confirm that it's there 247.
[17:56] So when I explain it to anybody, the
[18:00] first question I ask them, it's how does
[18:03] your money
[18:04] work? And the first answer I receive is,
[18:08] I don't really know. I'm trusting a lot.
[18:12] And the next thing is like, well, what
[18:14] if you don't have to trust it? What if
[18:16] you can actually check this and know
[18:19] that it's there, confirm that it's
[18:21] there? And it start becoming very easy.
[18:24] Uh, I had to explain it to an an elder
[18:27] and it was
[18:28] like you work all your life and this is
[18:33] how the government takes all your
[18:35] purchasing power just by inflating
[18:38] price. They don't even have to take it
[18:41] from you. They just have to uh price you
[18:43] out of things. Uh, one bitcoin is one
[18:46] bitcoin today
[18:48] and by the end of times. So it's the
[18:52] value that you and I are going to put to
[18:54] that. It's not something that the
[18:56] government is going to decide unless we
[18:59] want to agree to that, you know.
[19:03] That's uh that's that's really really
[19:05] cool uh to to to see it that way. And
[19:08] it's also the amount of clarity that you
[19:12] get of when you have Bitcoin and you're
[19:15] you're no longer trying to gain the
[19:17] system and to to to play around. Uh
[19:21] there's a lot of other advantages of
[19:23] like h having that that Bitcoin stack.
[19:26] Um and not losing purchasing power is
[19:30] probably the biggest one. Um but it's
[19:33] it's just great to have that mental
[19:35] clarity and that that focus in in your
[19:37] life. I love that a lot. Yeah. Yeah. No,
[19:41] it's very difficult to uh explain to
[19:44] someone Bitcoin when they still playing
[19:47] the fiat uh game. And I believe there's
[19:50] a lot of Bitcoiners who are Bitcoiners
[19:53] in the mind, but they still playing uh
[19:57] the fiat game because they still talking
[20:00] in the dollar. uh uh system, how to use
[20:03] Bitcoin in the dollar system, how to
[20:05] come out of Bitcoin uh back to the
[20:08] dollar system and how to get things in
[20:10] the dollar system. One of the things I
[20:12] really enjoy by listening to people like
[20:14] uh Jack, it's how they are
[20:18] 24/7 in Bitcoin and there's nothing
[20:22] besides what they're doing uh that it
[20:25] has to do with Bitcoin. So there's no
[20:26] other way uh for you to account and and
[20:31] keep your balance sheet than thinking in
[20:33] s. Uh and when you do that, the way you
[20:38] spend changes, the way you say changes,
[20:41] and the way you talk to people about it
[20:44] changes. That's super interesting when
[20:46] you really really get that. What do you
[20:49] think? What you said there are some
[20:51] Bitcoiners that are still in the fiat
[20:53] game. What What do you mean by that?
[20:56] Uh I think there's a there's a lot of
[20:58] talk uh about how Bitcoin benefits you
[21:03] by leveraging the fiat uh system. And as
[21:09] much as I enjoy number go up, don't get
[21:11] me wrong, as I enjoy the the the
[21:14] possibilities that you can do,
[21:16] uh there's a Bitcoin
[21:21] uh how you'll say
[21:23] it, Bitcoin is about exiting that that
[21:26] fiat system. And I think coming from a
[21:29] third world country, I can really see uh
[21:33] what it does to people when when someone
[21:36] leverages the fiat system. So as much as
[21:40] I understand why someone will do it and
[21:42] the benefits that you can have
[21:44] economically by doing those things, I
[21:47] also see who's paying the bill. And uh
[21:51] every time there's a short or a long or
[21:54] a trade on Bitcoin to make a couple of
[21:57] extra numbers, I know there's someone
[22:00] around the world that it just got priced
[22:02] out of Bitcoin. Uh and some people will
[22:06] say, well, that's part of the consensus
[22:09] and we all agree to that. Yes. But I
[22:11] think as Bitcoiners
[22:13] uh once I I tend to believe that once we
[22:16] plug into these uh you work for me, I
[22:19] work for you. So in that sense, I I
[22:25] think we still a little bit far from the
[22:29] collective mindset of what Satoshi
[22:32] intended when he created this, which it
[22:34] was like stick it to the banks and the
[22:37] system. Uh and I think uh being in the
[22:42] United States where we print the
[22:44] dollars, it's very easy to get confused
[22:46] uh between the the leveraging the the
[22:49] the system and and actually becoming a
[22:52] full-time Bitcoiner. Uh because every
[22:55] time I meet someone that is 247 Bitcoin,
[22:58] I see someone that you would uh you will
[23:03] never think they have the wealth they
[23:05] have. you will never think they're as
[23:08] knowledge as they are because they're
[23:10] not flexing. They don't have to. Uh and
[23:14] they actually very willing to sit with
[23:16] you, share all the information and help
[23:20] you thrive because they seen what it
[23:22] does to them, you know, at least it's
[23:25] what it happened to me.
[23:27] the that that it's like the true Bitcoin
[23:30] behavior where you are only in Bitcoin
[23:33] uh or at least like as much as possible
[23:35] in Bitcoin and you're no longer playing
[23:37] that fiat leverage the credit game. Do
[23:40] you think credit has a place also in the
[23:42] in the Bitcoin world?
[23:45] Yes. Yes. I I think it has I think uh if
[23:48] we remove the dishonesty be behind uh
[23:53] the credit part uh it's it has a place
[23:57] uh credit is good. It allows you to to
[24:00] build stuff that otherwise you couldn't
[24:02] uh do it on your own at the speed that
[24:04] you need do it and and create products.
[24:07] I I love that. I just don't like
[24:11] when the credit I can give you doesn't
[24:14] depend on the value you provide but it
[24:16] depends on your credit score. Uh it
[24:18] depends on who you know you know if I
[24:21] know someone and I can make a phone call
[24:23] then I get better credit. Uh what makes
[24:26] you more valuable you know than your
[24:29] skills? This is it is also the the topic
[24:32] of like Bitcoin is neutral and Bitcoin
[24:35] doesn't really care who you are, where
[24:38] you're coming from, and and what your
[24:40] bank balance is. Like Bitcoin is
[24:42] completely neutral to all of that and
[24:45] just treats you, how it treats everyone
[24:48] else because it's just open- source
[24:50] code. It don't it doesn't even know what
[24:52] a human being and and and things like
[24:55] that is. Uh but yeah, I'm I'm wondering
[24:58] a lot on how much of this Bitcoin system
[25:02] will be dominant and and how much are we
[25:05] taking from the fiat system onto onto
[25:09] Bitcoin and kind of taking into this
[25:11] this new Bitcoin world? Do do you have
[25:15] some do you think about that all the
[25:17] time? I think uh because I see the the
[25:20] narratives changing. I I I always say
[25:23] that show me the incentives and I'll
[25:24] show you the narratives around the
[25:26] world. Uh so it's it's a lot of uh the
[25:31] fundamentals uh are are used sometimes
[25:35] to create ideas and I think right now we
[25:38] are in that moment where the government
[25:40] it's trying to get a grip on Bitcoin. Uh
[25:44] I believe at some point they'll break
[25:46] something. It's not going to be Bitcoin,
[25:47] but they're going to break something
[25:49] because they're playing with fire. And I
[25:51] think they're trying to control uh the
[25:54] system uh either from the paper side of
[25:57] things or the IUS or or the the
[26:02] leverage, but um it always blow up. uh
[26:06] we had in 2021 FDX before we had Mac. We
[26:09] we we got so many things uh that show us
[26:12] like when you start trying to manipulate
[26:15] Bitcoin uh you're not going to get it
[26:18] done. You're just going to break
[26:20] something. Uh unfortunately you take uh
[26:23] when that happens you take a lot of
[26:24] Bitcoiners with you because
[26:27] uh people start getting greedy and and
[26:32] someone tells you there's a fastest way
[26:34] to there's a faster way to do this and
[26:36] and you start jumping on leverage and
[26:39] and things and the FOMO like uh like we
[26:43] heard this week this company is gonna
[26:45] buy Bitcoin or that one and then you are
[26:47] like okay then all my money goes here
[26:49] because this person. It's responsible of
[26:52] my value
[26:53] creation. Usually doesn't work that way.
[26:56] Bitcoin loves to educate us every time
[26:58] we do that. So, uh you were saying uh
[27:03] how do you keep this confidence? I seen
[27:05] I I I see many times how Bitcoin goes
[27:09] the other way when people try to
[27:11] manipulate number go up uh or number go
[27:14] down that it's like no here you have to
[27:17] create value. If you don't create value,
[27:19] you might have a nice run. Uh but it's
[27:22] not going to last. Yeah. Bitcoin is
[27:25] bringing the truth uh and bringing the
[27:28] the facts back to to the financial
[27:31] reality. It it made finances and
[27:34] economics a real science again and not
[27:38] that uh science that that we had before.
[27:43] So those brought the science back into
[27:45] the economics. I I loved it a lot. Yes.
[27:48] Yes. And and and the the the funny part
[27:51] in all this is like by by getting into
[27:54] Bitcoin, you start reading about
[27:56] economics and you start learning an
[27:59] entire thing that it's not about
[28:04] uh uh this the governments and the
[28:07] economist and everyone on TV, they're
[28:09] still talking to you like the
[28:11] information doesn't travel in a
[28:13] millisecond in the internet, you know?
[28:15] uh like you cannot do a research right
[28:17] away. Right now people just uh get an X
[28:20] and gro everything or chat with you
[28:22] whatever and in in five minutes you
[28:25] start looking for sources and things. So
[28:28] uh it's very hard to lie uh to people on
[28:32] the economic side of things unless
[28:36] uh those people are completely uh uh
[28:39] blinded. Uh and and one of the things
[28:42] that I believe the government miss uh
[28:45] when they try to get to you on on these
[28:49] uh comments or narratives and everything
[28:51] is the fact that look at the end of the
[28:53] day I'm going to go to the store if I
[28:56] cannot afford it I'm going to look for
[28:58] something else. I'm going to need a
[29:00] change. Doesn't matter what they tell
[29:02] them. They can come out and say like
[29:04] inflation is this or that. If the price
[29:06] double inflation is 100%.
[29:09] doesn't matter what the chart says on on
[29:12] the news
[29:13] tonight, you know, and when you see
[29:16] those things, it's very difficult to put
[29:18] the the genie back into the bottle.
[29:20] Let's take a break for a moment and
[29:23] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[29:25] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[29:28] watches. Those watches are the most
[29:30] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[29:33] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[29:36] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:39] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:42] watch collections. You have the date of
[29:45] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[29:48] there and of course also the block
[29:50] height and which epoch we are currently
[29:53] in. I love the level of detail they put
[29:56] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[29:59] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:02] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[30:04] love those watches. so so much. And now
[30:07] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[30:10] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[30:12] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[30:14] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[30:16] first way is you put it on a hardware
[30:18] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[30:21] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[30:24] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[30:27] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[30:30] if you check out the link in the
[30:32] description, you even get 5% off if you
[30:35] use the code Robin. And the second way
[30:37] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[30:40] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[30:44] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[30:47] They will personalize for you a
[30:49] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[30:51] your individual situation. They will
[30:55] show you how you can secure your own
[30:57] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[30:59] enough. You also have to keep all your
[31:01] devices secure. One topic that is
[31:04] overlooked often is the inheritance
[31:06] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[31:09] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[31:12] a plan for that in place already? And
[31:14] last but not least, if you're in a
[31:16] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[31:18] it's better to get a plan B for all
[31:21] that. Head over to the
[31:25] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[31:28] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[31:30] be for the first time ever speaking at
[31:33] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[31:36] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[31:38] really looking forward to seeing all of
[31:40] you there. You can get your ticket in
[31:43] the link down in the description of
[31:45] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[31:47] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[31:51] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[31:53] there. Yeah, you can only cover the the
[31:57] truth and the reality for so long. At
[32:00] some point it just is so important and
[32:05] it not important it is so strong the
[32:08] reality that it will shine through. If
[32:10] you print 40 50% of the money supply
[32:14] each
[32:14] year, you cannot keep inflation at 2%.
[32:19] That's just ridiculous to to believe
[32:21] that. Uh and even though they might say,
[32:25] "Oh, it's
[32:27] between the the inflation is high be
[32:30] because of the Ukraine war. Inflation is
[32:32] high uh because I don't know uh the the
[32:37] craziest thing was some some singer you
[32:39] heard about that Beyonce or I don't know
[32:43] some singer and they're like, "Oh,
[32:44] inflation is rising because of her."
[32:46] like, "No, no, it's because we're
[32:48] printing money." Like, that that's that
[32:51] that's the thing. But obviously, they
[32:53] don't want uh people to know about uh
[32:56] and yeah, most people actually don't
[32:58] know about it, but they do search for a
[33:01] solution. They're like, "Oh, my my money
[33:04] is getting worth less and less less, and
[33:06] he has Bitcoin and he seems to do fine.
[33:08] Like, he he seems to do good." And I
[33:11] compare it often to if there's a fist
[33:15] fight and someone shows up with a
[33:17] gun, he he wins that
[33:20] fight, but another person says like,
[33:24] "Oh, like he showed up with a gun and he
[33:25] won. I should also buy a gun." Uh, in a
[33:29] in a in a very similar way, um, Bitcoin
[33:33] is also showing the game theory
[33:35] advantage
[33:36] uh that you have when you have Bitcoin.
[33:40] So,
[33:42] uh, you have Bitcoin and someone else is
[33:45] like, "Oh, like why is this why does he
[33:48] buy a new house, a new car, like why is
[33:50] he living so good? Why does he never
[33:52] complain about money? Why is he living
[33:55] free? Why does he he not have to work?
[33:57] Why can he spend so much time with his
[33:59] family?" At some point, people will know
[34:01] like, "Oh, yeah. Like, they're using
[34:03] sound money." So, I I I absolutely love
[34:06] uh your story. It's it's a true
[34:08] Bitcoiner story.
[34:10] No, thank you. Thank you. Yes, it's it's
[34:13] um it's a journey. It's a journey. It
[34:16] takes a lot of uh learning. Uh I I
[34:19] always tell everyone who gets uh in
[34:22] Bitcoin for the first time, you're going
[34:23] to learn a lot and you're going to make
[34:24] a lot of mistakes. Uh but the good thing
[34:27] is there's a lot of Bitcoiners that are
[34:29] always willing to share uh their stories
[34:32] and and their information and and pass
[34:34] it along. And the reality is like you're
[34:37] always looking for a solution as you
[34:40] said. So it's it's I I remember talking
[34:44] to Argentinians and and started to tell
[34:46] them about uh about Bitcoin and what and
[34:49] what was happening. And the first thing
[34:52] that uh one person told me which was
[34:54] cool. It was like so you're telling me
[34:56] that uh the dollar it's like the
[34:59] Argentinian peso and Bitcoin is like the
[35:01] dollar because that's how Argentinians
[35:04] think. And in 5 minutes that person
[35:07] described Bitcoin in their head and they
[35:09] understood it. Oh no, of course I don't
[35:11] have to trust anybody. Yeah, I want it
[35:13] right now. Tomorrow it's going to be the
[35:15] same price. When you start thinking like
[35:17] that or seeing those things, there's no
[35:20] coming back. And then you can watch the
[35:22] news, you can interact, get upset of
[35:24] what they say. But I don't know, for me
[35:27] personally, I'm no longer believe it. I
[35:30] watch it as a entertainment, you know,
[35:32] but uh I I I see what's happening in the
[35:36] back. So it's like, okay, we can talk
[35:38] about this, but at the end of the day,
[35:40] one Bitcoin, one Bitcoin, you're not
[35:42] going to fight it.
[35:44] Sailor did the research, never came
[35:46] back. Now you you have an entire
[35:49] governments and everybody doing exactly
[35:52] the same. And we know where all this
[35:54] ends.
[35:56] Absolutely. And I love I love that so
[35:58] much because um I had a period in my
[36:01] life where I was like 15 to 18 years
[36:04] old. I got really interested in
[36:06] politics. I I watch the local news, the
[36:09] mainstream news like every single day
[36:12] religiously. Uh then I got a period in
[36:15] my life where I didn't do that at all.
[36:17] Now I'm back actually at a period of my
[36:19] life where I do actually uh every day
[36:22] try to consume at least like 10 uh
[36:24] minutes maybe sometimes not even 10
[36:26] minutes like just 5 minutes seeing
[36:28] through the mainstream news what's going
[36:30] on. The difference is back then I just
[36:33] believed everything they said and now
[36:37] I'm more just looking at it to see what
[36:42] general uh direction the general
[36:45] population is going towards and even
[36:48] that is slowly becoming not true anymore
[36:51] because most people don't even watch the
[36:53] news anymore.
[36:55] Yep. Yep. Yeah. No. And it and it's like
[36:58] that which is it's it's funny because
[37:00] when I when I talk uh with other
[37:02] Bitcoiners or stuff, the first thing we
[37:04] said is like I mean basically uh before
[37:07] the narrative was like they going to ban
[37:09] Bitcoin, they're going to come after,
[37:11] they're going to break it or something.
[37:12] But now it's it's so simple to see look
[37:16] the only thing that these people can do
[37:20] it's become fiscally responsible. Uh
[37:23] it's become honest. It's not try to take
[37:25] advantage of the people. It's end
[37:27] poverty around the world. Everything
[37:29] that they have never done. It's the only
[37:32] thing that they and they and they all
[37:33] need to come together also. All the
[37:35] countries in the world need to get
[37:37] together on a table and say we all agree
[37:39] to the same things. Never fight again.
[37:41] This is how we destroy
[37:43] Bitcoin. It's it's not going to happen.
[37:47] That's Yeah.
[37:49] And and don't you think we are already
[37:51] above the point where they can fiscally
[37:53] be responsible? Like I I I think
[37:56] the they they would need to reset the
[38:00] currency, get a new one, reset the
[38:04] depth, and then never make depth again
[38:09] and go through the hardest economics
[38:12] times ever. Because all of the sudden we
[38:15] are we we are like truck addicts that
[38:20] running around with drugs in in our in
[38:23] our arms and in our heads. H and all of
[38:26] the sudden you're taking away all the
[38:27] drugs. You're completely taking away
[38:29] from everything. He's only getting like
[38:32] one meal a day and water.
[38:35] Hard time. And I think we will get out
[38:38] good in the other time. But in that time
[38:41] where it's hard, there will be a lot of
[38:44] pressure to politicians saying like
[38:46] where where weak people say like, "Oh,
[38:49] we need the politics to save us. We need
[38:52] money for that." And and I hear it all
[38:54] the time in the in the news uh with
[38:56] mainstream media and it's super
[38:57] fascinating. I'm I'm curious what you
[38:59] think around that. Um we always thinking
[39:02] of oh no in Austria currently like most
[39:06] people don't care about Austria but I
[39:07] will just bring that example of right
[39:09] now we are thinking about are we
[39:13] doing an anthro processing or not depth
[39:17] processing basically means if a country
[39:20] is not doing good fiscally in the EU the
[39:24] EU can actually um put that country uh
[39:28] in a in a bigger observation uh in a
[39:32] more deeper observation. So that country
[39:36] is then really bad. So currently France
[39:39] is in there, Italy is in there and like
[39:43] I think seven other countries. So if
[39:46] you're in that process as a country,
[39:48] you're not doing good. Like you have a
[39:50] lot of depth and you are actually not
[39:52] even doing good within the depth system.
[39:56] And now uh they are accepting the depth
[39:59] process because otherwise they would
[40:02] need to save and they would need to not
[40:05] spend money and and they they they're
[40:07] not doing
[40:08] that. They they they can't I mean uh
[40:12] it's for for me probably becomes easy uh
[40:15] after studying uh economics and and and
[40:18] history in Argentina because I I seen
[40:22] this process like firsthand. Uh, I saw
[40:25] how they always kicking the can and they
[40:28] letting the next the next person deal
[40:30] with it and they create a new product
[40:32] that it looks like it but it's like if
[40:34] you're making the I don't know pasta
[40:37] sauce and because it doesn't taste good
[40:40] you keep adding ingredients at some
[40:42] point it nobody wants to eat it uh it
[40:44] tastes bad. So this is happening all the
[40:48] time. I believe that uh 2020 they broke
[40:52] something uh because they pushed too
[40:54] hard. Uh and now they're trying to fix
[40:59] it somehow. But it's it's first I think
[41:04] there's a lot of people that you cannot
[41:06] longer uh convince of nothing. uh so
[41:10] that that is it's it's done and I think
[41:13] because of how they manipulated the
[41:16] currency to not lose power and to uh
[41:19] avoid revolts and all these uh they
[41:23] ended up sacrificing themselves uh by
[41:25] exposing themselves. They they they had
[41:27] to lie so hard that everybody can see it
[41:30] now. And when you when you lie so much
[41:34] and so fast so hard, uh you can't keep
[41:38] it together. I love listening to
[41:41] podcasts more than anything else because
[41:44] you can lie for three hours straight. At
[41:46] some point you break uh and you say
[41:49] something that expose you as who you
[41:51] are, as what you think and all that. And
[41:54] I think that's why many politicians
[41:56] don't want to sit on a podcast because
[41:58] they know they can't keep it together.
[42:00] And I like to listen to those who
[42:03] actually do take the the choice to do
[42:06] that because it's like, okay, you have
[42:08] something to say. Uh whether they're
[42:10] right or wrong, doesn't mean they
[42:11] understand Bitcoin or they understand
[42:13] what is happening, but at least they're
[42:16] willing to expose themselves. Uh those
[42:18] are the people that are going to
[42:20] continue to be given a chance. You know,
[42:23] the other people needs to change the the
[42:25] narrative and understand what's
[42:27] happening. I think Bitcoin exposes you
[42:30] right away. There's no way you can be a
[42:33] scammer in Bitcoin. And that's why
[42:35] exists because the moment you put it on
[42:37] Bitcoin, it's like, "Okay, this is it."
[42:39] Uh, and you're out of the game. SB U Sam
[42:44] Freeman. That's uh he tried to do that
[42:47] and he broke something, but he didn't
[42:49] break Bitcoin. He broke his entire world
[42:51] on that. And I think that's that's the
[42:54] example when someone says, "Well, what
[42:57] can I go wrong in Bitcoin?" Well, your
[42:59] life can go wrong. Bitcoin continues
[43:01] every 10 minutes. It doesn't matter.
[43:04] That's that's so true. It is al also
[43:08] fascinating to see how in America the
[43:11] election I mean now it's it's it's some
[43:13] uh some months or like almost half a
[43:15] year over. Uh but it was interesting to
[43:19] see Donald Trump go on. so many podcasts
[43:24] uh and they were clearly completely
[43:26] unscripted. So that was just clearly
[43:28] visible if you listen to the podcast. Uh
[43:31] and he not only went to like Joe Rogan
[43:34] uh or an Edin Ross like live stream some
[43:38] some uh young kid basically that live
[43:41] streams uh and and and those things. He
[43:45] just went on there and and he talked
[43:47] about taking drugs with Tio. What? Like
[43:54] that is so like no matter what you think
[43:57] about Donald Trump. Uh and I I'm not a
[43:59] fan actually. Uh but that's so cool that
[44:03] he goes there. You also have to consider
[44:05] his age and and in what world he lived
[44:08] in. his ability to adapt to the
[44:11] situation and his ability to actually be
[44:15] there and uh and have a honest great
[44:19] conversation there. I think he is uh he
[44:23] would be a fun guy uh to to be to be
[44:25] around because he actually is like he
[44:27] he's perceived. And then on the other
[44:29] side you have Harris and and Biden that
[44:32] I I could not like can you even imagine
[44:35] them being on like a a threehour live
[44:38] stream with Eden Ross or with Jerome
[44:41] that that's I couldn't I cannot even
[44:44] imagine because they haven't done it
[44:46] even. Yeah, it's I mean I'm a musician.
[44:49] You can be the best musician in the
[44:50] world if you don't understand how to
[44:52] connect with your crowd and you don't
[44:54] pay attention to your crowd and uh you
[44:58] try to shine for what you can play
[45:01] instead of trying to connect with
[45:03] people, you ain't going to get anywhere.
[45:05] It doesn't matter. Uh it's it's it's
[45:08] like a proof of work uh if you want to
[45:11] say it. Uh or or exchange for uh your
[45:14] value, time, and energy. If I want to
[45:17] sell you a product and you don't need
[45:19] the product, I'm going to have a really
[45:21] hard time. I can have the best product
[45:24] in the world, you're not going to want
[45:25] it. Uh I can try to sell it. I can try
[45:29] to market anything. I can try to build
[45:31] all these. Uh but at the end of the day,
[45:36] uh it's not going to work. I see it all
[45:38] the time when people argue about like
[45:40] chat GBT or or Gro and everything and
[45:44] they what is the advantage of using
[45:46] Grock on X? I don't have to switch the
[45:48] app. It's all in there. So when you're
[45:51] paying for X, you're not just paying for
[45:53] that service. You're paying for the
[45:54] whole package. What is the other guy
[45:57] offering that I cannot get here? The
[46:00] same thing happens on stage when I play.
[46:03] If you don't like the music I'm playing,
[46:05] even if I'm the best musician in the
[46:07] world, it's not going to work. I think
[46:10] politicians study acting for a reason,
[46:14] you know. Uh they need to appeal to
[46:17] people. They need to talk to people.
[46:18] They need to sell you their message
[46:20] whether it's true or not. Uh one thing I
[46:25] can say, it's
[46:27] like Donald Trump understands very well
[46:31] how to talk to people.
[46:33] uh and I think they get the message
[46:36] across whether it's the one you like or
[46:38] not up for debate anybody can have their
[46:40] own but he understands that I think what
[46:43] it happened this time it's like
[46:46] uh the the other side or or or Harry's
[46:50] in the during the campaign they became
[46:52] so aggressive but it wasn't aggressive
[46:55] towards what was happening it was
[46:57] aggressive towards the people that were
[46:59] not understanding their message It's the
[47:02] same thing happened in Argentina when
[47:05] Makri uh President Machri lost the
[47:07] election. He got very aggressive with
[47:09] the people pretty much calling the
[47:11] citizens uh ignorance for not choosing
[47:14] him. And once they do that, you're done
[47:17] because a lot of people is going to be
[47:20] hurt, not even offended. Uh you know, so
[47:23] they're going to walk away. Uh it's it's
[47:27] it's in it's like Bitcoin. It's P2P cash
[47:32] system. I I'm going to exchange value
[47:34] with you, time and energy. Uh I have to
[47:37] receive something. If you're only asking
[47:39] me to do and you're not going to provide
[47:41] anything back, then it's not going to
[47:44] work whether you're the best or not. It
[47:47] that doesn't matter, you know. Do you
[47:49] think um this
[47:52] is do you think Bitcoin brings that out
[47:55] in a human being or are we just in a
[47:59] very early crowd that is just special
[48:02] because when I talk to you uh and and
[48:04] it's super fun because we never talked
[48:06] before and it's like 40 minutes and then
[48:09] I I almost feel like you're friends and
[48:12] it's like uh and we talked multiple
[48:14] times just because uh we have a shared
[48:17] interest in a very early revolution to
[48:19] each other. Um, but do you think that
[48:21] Bitcoin changes human beings to a
[48:24] certain degree to be more self-
[48:26] sovereign to be more critical of of what
[48:28] they hear and and hear more the signal
[48:31] and not the noise of how you described
[48:33] it so beautifully the last 40 minutes? I
[48:36] think I think yes. I think once once you
[48:38] start going down the rabbit hole and and
[48:40] you start understanding uh uh value
[48:43] proposition what proof of work is about
[48:45] and and you start meeting other
[48:47] bitcoiners who are in the same journey
[48:50] and you start seeing that we all looking
[48:53] to uh somehow improve the world around
[48:55] us uh there's no way you can take
[48:59] advantage I mean you try you can try you
[49:02] can do all these things but eventually
[49:04] it it Bitcoin does it cleans every four
[49:07] years. And it's it's beautiful because
[49:10] it's it's beautiful because you start
[49:12] removing uh uh all the all the people
[49:16] that is trying to take advantage and the
[49:19] you start meeting these bitcoiners who
[49:21] actually live on a bitcoin standard. Uh
[49:24] they create circular economies around
[49:26] the world. Probably because I come from
[49:29] a different country. I got the
[49:31] opportunity to pay more attention to
[49:33] what's happening outside uh because I
[49:36] seen it, I lived there and and you see
[49:38] how uh these little communities are
[49:41] growing and and building something and
[49:43] it's like somehow I want to participate.
[49:46] I always was an ex listening to podcast
[49:48] and stuff and then it got to a point
[49:50] that I I want to tell people that this
[49:53] works that this improved your life and
[49:55] you're going to do it and I don't know
[49:57] how because you believe or personally
[50:00] I'm always like I'm not ready. I need
[50:02] more study. These people are very
[50:04] knowledgeable. But then at the end of
[50:05] the day it's like you know what I just
[50:07] have to tell people this works. Give it
[50:10] a shot. Put the hours in and you're
[50:12] going to see the results. It's not an
[50:15] overnight thing but you will see the
[50:17] results.
[50:18] Absolutely. And and you will uh see how
[50:22] big I even I even go to the extreme. I
[50:26] think Bitcoin might just be the fork in
[50:29] the road of human civilization in a very
[50:31] similar way as the printing press, as
[50:34] electricity and as the internet
[50:37] uh was completely changing uh how we
[50:41] think about the world and society. Like
[50:44] the printing press is very obvious
[50:45] because information and books were
[50:47] controlled by basically the church and
[50:50] it was very small uh and group that
[50:53] actually controlled information. All of
[50:54] a sudden, the printing press is out
[50:56] there and you can print books. Uh the
[50:58] the grazer statistics, I actually looked
[51:00] it up because I'm I'm writing an article
[51:02] around that. Um before the printing
[51:05] press, it took around one to two to
[51:08] three years to um print one Gutenberg
[51:13] Bible, something along those lines. It
[51:16] really took a long time um uh to to
[51:21] write that Gutenberg Bible. I think like
[51:24] 1,300 sites or something like that pages
[51:27] in there. Uh and uh then uh Johannes
[51:31] Gutenberg uh printed in the first what
[51:36] was it five
[51:38] years 180 copies
[51:41] himself. Uh previously that would have
[51:44] needed um 180 people to print the same
[51:48] thing. Uh now it did one person. What
[51:51] did it do? That uh all of the sudden in
[51:54] whole of Europe uh what was it I think
[51:56] 15 years later 20 million books were
[52:00] printed like from from one book in 3
[52:04] years to 180 books in 3 years to uh uh
[52:09] 20 million books in 10 years or 15
[52:12] years. Uh and I think Bitcoin has a very
[52:15] similar
[52:17] um uh impact on on on where we are
[52:20] going. Uh it's obviously not about
[52:23] information. It's more about money, but
[52:25] that has implications we cannot even see
[52:28] right now going into like the the next
[52:31] 20 years. Yeah. Um sorry for ranting,
[52:34] but I'm very excited about Bitcoin.
[52:36] Yeah. No, no. And it's good. I I I uh
[52:40] when I read uh Lyn Alden's book uh
[52:42] broken money uh she goes into this
[52:45] evolution uh in time with all these same
[52:49] on the Bitcoin standard uh but safe but
[52:52] um you can see that the the the
[52:55] evolution is happening uh anyway and you
[52:58] always arrive to this digital money that
[53:01] you going to exchange uh for value
[53:03] because it always happened and always
[53:05] been uh it's just the evolution
[53:08] uh the information is out. You can print
[53:11] it. There's books. I love to have my
[53:13] books uh in physical because I enjoy uh
[53:17] reading them. But most of the time I'm
[53:19] on the road, I listen to this stuff. Uh
[53:22] and then I go and read it uh to do like
[53:25] a second thing. But it's evolving. The
[53:28] information is troubling so fast. I can
[53:30] now do a a a cut ride to one of my
[53:34] performances and I finish a book. in one
[53:37] day. Uh so it's all that is troubling so
[53:42] fast. It's gonna happen. It's happening.
[53:44] You can see it in plain sight. There's a
[53:47] reason why the governments decide to put
[53:48] it on the center stage. You know, uh I
[53:52] think they couldn't hide Bitcoin anymore
[53:54] uh or attack it anymore. Uh besides
[53:57] Peter Schiff, everyone else understands
[54:00] that this is happening. Uh, and I think
[54:04] after what Trump is doing, whether he
[54:08] breaks it or not, you can't hide Bitcoin
[54:12] anymore. Bitcoin is out there now.
[54:13] Everybody's going to know what it is.
[54:15] Every president receive a folder that
[54:18] says the United States is looking at
[54:19] this, so you should do it, too. In
[54:23] somehow, it's arriving to a lot of
[54:25] people. Uh, and that evolution, you
[54:29] can't stop it. You can't stop it. It's
[54:31] like it's like the car. It's it's done.
[54:34] It's out there. It's the phone. We used
[54:36] to believe who needs a website. Now, if
[54:38] you don't have one, nobody finds you,
[54:40] you know, and now if you don't have an
[54:41] app or you don't have a a handle on on
[54:44] social media, you're you don't exist for
[54:47] some people. So, that evolution is
[54:50] happening. Absolutely. And they are the
[54:52] people that uh take advantage of that or
[54:54] take advant use that and actually act on
[54:57] on on the revolution and those who
[54:59] always stay behind and and and don't do
[55:01] it. Um how how different do you think a
[55:05] Bitcoin world will be uh versus what
[55:08] what we have now? I think I think it's
[55:10] going to be a more honest uh world. I
[55:13] think you won't be able to uh get wealth
[55:16] or or acquire money if you don't provide
[55:19] a service. Uh, I think even if you want
[55:22] to play the credit game, you're still
[55:24] gonna have to provide some collateral.
[55:27] And in order to get that, you're gonna
[55:29] have to provide value for someone.
[55:31] You're not going to be able to uh uh
[55:33] just print it out of the air. Uh I think
[55:36] it's going to take a long time. I don't
[55:38] think it's happening overnight. Uh I
[55:41] when people scream like we're going to a
[55:43] million dollars, we're all retiring. I I
[55:45] smile. I enjoy it. I hope to be
[55:47] completely wrong. I think it's going to
[55:49] take longer than what many most people
[55:52] expect, but uh I think it's creating a
[55:56] more honest interaction uh between money
[55:59] and and the service you provide and how
[56:02] you get paid. I think we're going in
[56:05] that sense is going back to the fact
[56:07] that uh you need to solve a problem for
[56:10] me to give you money otherwise I'm not
[56:13] interested. Absolutely. Um, one one more
[56:16] thing be before we come to the end
[56:18] routine. Do you think that Bitcoin is
[56:20] the final evolution or revolution of of
[56:23] of money? I think it's the best that we
[56:26] have right now. Uh, if I have to see
[56:28] everything evolving and what I see
[56:30] everything around, I consider it the
[56:32] same as the internet protocol. I don't
[56:34] see the reason why would you want
[56:36] something different.
[56:38] Uh but it also I understand that humans
[56:42] don't stay uh quiet and sitting down.
[56:45] Everybody likes to evolve. Everybody
[56:47] likes to grow and that's why there's so
[56:49] many try and errors on many things. Uh I
[56:53] just
[56:54] think that Bitcoin is the best thing. I
[56:58] think it show up and it re it
[57:01] revolutionize everything. It changes the
[57:03] way we think.
[57:04] So I don't think this is a system that
[57:08] it came to stay for a while. What we
[57:10] develop the next thing I think this is
[57:12] the next thing. I think there's
[57:15] a 100 years plus of this evolving. How
[57:19] is it going to look? I don't know
[57:22] obviously uh I can't predict the future
[57:25] but what I can see is that uh Bitcoin
[57:29] itself it's same as the internet
[57:32] protocol. things evolve and change but
[57:34] we still have that same layer and I
[57:37] think Bitcoin is that layer when it
[57:39] comes to money. Absolutely. Um I have
[57:41] one question that I ask each and every
[57:43] one of my guests and the question is
[57:45] what can we learn from you besides
[57:47] Bitcoin? Uh I think you can learn
[57:50] curiosity and uh yes put the hours uh I
[57:55] always tell everybody I I won't give you
[57:58] Bitcoin for free. I I need you to either
[58:01] read the book or do something about it.
[58:03] Uh I believe in proof of work like my
[58:06] most important thing and I think uh if
[58:10] you want to take something from me it's
[58:12] the value creation. You got to provide
[58:14] value to someone in order to to create
[58:17] your wealth. It will make you honest and
[58:20] it fix everything around you once you do
[58:22] that. Really really cool. Um, we have an
[58:24] end in the podcast where the the
[58:26] previous guest is asking a question for
[58:28] the next guest without knowing who the
[58:29] next guest actually is. And
[58:32] uh, it's a political one, interestingly
[58:34] enough. Uh, the previous guest asked
[58:36] you, "What can we do to better connect
[58:39] Bitcoiners across the political
[58:42] spectrum?" That's a good
[58:45] one. I think it's to keep the
[58:47] conversation honest. I'm going to go
[58:49] back to that. Keep it open. People is
[58:51] going to make their own decisions. Uh,
[58:54] but I think we need to uh stop having
[58:57] heroes in Bitcoin and make Satoshi and
[59:00] Bitcoin the hero. Everyone else is a
[59:03] character that plays around that. Uh,
[59:06] but we need to stop attaching Bitcoin to
[59:09] Michael Sailor or everybody. They're
[59:11] very uh
[59:14] important, but they're not Bitcoin. And
[59:17] I think once we remove all the
[59:19] politicians and and and the suits uh
[59:22] from the billboard and we go back to
[59:25] Bitcoin is Bitcoin, that's when you're
[59:27] going to start connecting people. Yeah,
[59:30] that's that's that's very true. Um thank
[59:33] you so much, Erin, for for for being on
[59:35] the show. Before I let you go, where can
[59:37] people find you, ask you questions, and
[59:38] and reach out to you? Uh I'm always
[59:41] hanging out on X. Very easy to find. Uh
[59:44] so try to share every single podcast or
[59:47] information that helped me. I pass it
[59:49] along. Uh so you can go find me there.
[59:53] My name uh it's very easy to find on the
[59:57] internet. But please don't come to my
[60:00] house. I don't have anything. I can't
[60:02] give it to
[60:03] you. So let's keep it in the same side
[60:07] now. But uh yeah, the conversation in X
[60:10] is always what I I like to enjoy and
[60:13] uh see you anywhere.
[60:17] What do his ex account and not to his
[60:20] house? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're not
[60:23] going to find nothing. You have to talk
[60:25] to a lot of people and you have to do a
[60:27] lot of work. And you also It's not worth
[60:30] it. Believe me, because uh I'm not those
[60:33] uh type of people that hoards Bitcoin
[60:35] forever. I use it. So, uh, very nice.
[60:39] Yeah, you you find more value when you
[60:43] steal all his content from Twitter.
[60:46] Yes, you pro you're going to benefit a
[60:48] lot. You're going to make a lot of money
[60:49] by doing that. You don't have to risk uh
[60:51] your freedom.
[60:54] I love that. Really cool. Thank you so
[60:56] much, Erin, for for being on the show.
