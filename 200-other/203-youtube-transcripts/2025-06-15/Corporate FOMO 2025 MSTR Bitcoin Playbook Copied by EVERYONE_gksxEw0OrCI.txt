[00:00] the fastb accounting change is going to
[00:01] be a big Catalyst the first public
[00:04] company which I think has a chance on
[00:06] the other side of this uh hyper baniz
[00:08] Event Horizon to be one of the biggest
[00:10] companies in the world there's never
[00:11] been a public company on a gold standard
[00:13] why when has a public company ever said
[00:14] all our goal is to require as much gold
[00:16] as possible even the gold bugs are
[00:18] passing out dividends in dollars why
[00:20] aren't gold companies stacking gold in
[00:21] the balance sheet and diluting their
[00:22] Equity to buy gold you're able to borrow
[00:25] Fiat for 2% for 7 years to buy an asset
[00:28] that's appreciating by X % over the next
[00:31] 7 years these banks are going to figure
[00:32] out once they can custody it themselves
[00:34] that Bitcoin is the Best Collateral over
[00:35] collateralized Bitcoin lending is a zero
[00:37] loss business but that's been
[00:38] misconstrued by years of crypto schemes
[00:42] and counterparty risk and
[00:43] rehypothecation the recovery rate for an
[00:45] overc colateral Bitcoin loan is 100% And
[00:47] the time to liquidate is 10 minutes that
[00:49] Bitcoin is no longer just this little
[00:51] bubble that kids are playing with in the
[00:53] side pool Bitcoin is the real game
[00:55] Bitcoin slowly just kind of trojen
[00:57] horsing its way onto the asset side of
[00:59] the global balance sheet the volatility
[01:00] it's not a bug it's a feature it's a
[01:02] tool to be leveraged the wealthy don't
[01:04] sell assets they just borrow against
[01:06] them the exchange rate of Bitcoin is
[01:08] like the the alarm Bell in a world where
[01:09] Bitcoin is 100 times larger if Congress
[01:12] says oh you know we we we thought we
[01:13] were going to run 1% deficits this year
[01:15] we're going to run 10% deficits Bitcoin
[01:17] moons if you think about what JD Vance
[01:19] and Trump's platform is we need to
[01:21] reshore manufacturing we need to weaken
[01:23] the dollar and they're also bull posting
[01:26] about Bitcoin those things aren't
[01:28] unrelated a Harris Administration
[01:29] doesn't stop Bitcoin from reaching six
[01:31] figures
[01:35] plus what do you think will be the
[01:38] impact of a company adopting a Bitcoin
[01:42] yeah I think um I mean it's been four
[01:44] years uh the The Playbook is is entirely
[01:47] Vindicated um micro strategy is the you
[01:50] know it's outperformed every S&P 500
[01:52] company um since it's adoption including
[01:55] like Tech Darlings like
[01:56] Nvidia um and so you know I think that
[02:00] it's it started off and sailor says this
[02:02] and it started off as a defensive
[02:04] strategy you know the covid inflation
[02:07] money printing 0% interest rates you
[02:10] know we need a hedge evaluate gold
[02:12] stocks real estate passive index
[02:17] investing um buying back your own shares
[02:21] um which is certainly was part of the
[02:23] the calculus for them for micro strategy
[02:25] it's basically what everyone else does
[02:27] right um is like you know we don't want
[02:30] to hold the the melting Ice Cube as as
[02:32] as it was said what do we do well uh you
[02:34] know just I guess we can artificially
[02:37] pump our earnings maybe we maybe we debt
[02:39] Finance it and uh get a bit of Leverage
[02:41] and really really you know Goose the
[02:43] earnings per share um but you know they
[02:46] bought some Bitcoin Instead at you N9
[02:48] 10,000 $1,000 um you know prce that was
[02:52] before the kind this kind of crazy bull
[02:54] market um and quickly it turned from a
[02:56] from a defensive strategy to an
[02:58] offensive strategy um um so you know
[03:01] debt fi debt financed uh Bitcoin
[03:03] purchases Equity delution convertible
[03:06] notes which is still I think this very
[03:09] misunderstood um strategy they're
[03:10] implementing um which is you know borrow
[03:14] borrowing money for five or six years
[03:16] you're you're blending you know almost
[03:17] this like this this Equity call option
[03:20] on your own common stock you're like
[03:21] selling volatility of your of you're
[03:24] selling leveraged Bitcoin
[03:26] volatility to buy more Bitcoin um you
[03:30] know you or me can't do that we don't we
[03:31] can't print uh print our own shares um
[03:35] but but for a corporation for a public
[03:36] company you can um and so you know
[03:39] really I think it started off as just an
[03:43] exemplary hey you know you can have this
[03:45] as a portfolio
[03:46] diversifier um and it transitioned
[03:49] into I I think this is the The Best
[03:51] Thing Tone out of out of every asset in
[03:53] the world um and and eventually you know
[03:55] this is going this is I mean it already
[03:57] is for micro strategy and for me for me
[03:59] and you Bitcoin is The Benchmark um but
[04:02] for for the world of for the world of
[04:05] Finance now you know they're looking at
[04:07] they're looking at the dollar as a
[04:08] benchmark or maybe the the you know
[04:11] passive performance of S&P 500 as a as a
[04:14] benchmark um and so you know I think
[04:17] that that corporate adoption is
[04:18] happening um the fbe accounting G uh
[04:21] change is going to be a a big big
[04:23] Catalyst we've already seen a few
[04:25] companies adopt it um like you know one
[04:28] of the things that uh that isn't really
[04:31] understood or I didn't understand is how
[04:33] much of the you know the the intangible
[04:36] accounting uh treatment or framework of
[04:38] of Bitcoin today or in the past was like
[04:41] a uh a disincentive to adopt right where
[04:44] your earnings per share could only go
[04:45] down as a result of Bitcoin going down
[04:47] but they couldn't get uh couldn't ratch
[04:49] it up um so I think that's you know
[04:52] maybe for someone like Michael Sor if me
[04:54] and you were running a public company it
[04:57] you know whatever doesn't matter but for
[04:58] anyone that's incentivized bu by
[05:00] earnings um or you know kind of these
[05:02] like whatever whatever benchmarks um for
[05:05] your quarterly or annual reports um that
[05:08] was a big a big disincentive um and so
[05:11] yeah I think that this we're still in
[05:13] the super early phase I would have
[05:15] expected it to happen sooner um but you
[05:18] know four years into micro strategy I
[05:20] think there's you know probably 50
[05:22] Public companies globally with L at some
[05:25] you know some Bitcoin exposure I think
[05:27] there's only a handful of public
[05:28] companies that are truly
[05:30] um you know following micro strategy
[05:32] starting to to actually you know go on a
[05:35] full Bitcoin standard um even some of
[05:37] the minors right they're on like a hash
[05:39] rate standard you know they're on an as6
[05:42] standard um if you look at in Bitcoin
[05:44] per share terms basically I think
[05:47] there's only one or one or two miners
[05:48] out of 20 plus publicly traded miners
[05:51] that have added Bitcoin per share over
[05:53] over 3 four year period um there may not
[05:56] be any um but I saw cathedr Bitcoin put
[05:59] out a a report where they they've
[06:01] transitioned from like or transitioning
[06:03] from prop mining as6 you know trying to
[06:07] get as much hat as possible to mine
[06:08] which is a brutal business difficulty
[06:10] adjustment just brutal um to more of
[06:14] more hosting which is like kind of
[06:16] steady Fiat cash flows not not levered
[06:18] Bitcoin exposure Bitcoin derivative
[06:21] exposure in the form of as6 and and
[06:23] being long hatch rate you know it's just
[06:25] like this Global arms race um and
[06:27] instead thinking about it in Bitcoin per
[06:29] share term
[06:30] of okay cash flow into Bitcoin you know
[06:33] use Bitcoin as collateral maybe more
[06:35] infrastructure buy more Bitcoin and if
[06:37] it doesn't increase Bitcoin per share
[06:39] terms if it doesn't increase you know if
[06:41] it's not Bitcoin positive then you don't
[06:43] do it and bit and just the alternative
[06:45] is just sitting and acquiring more
[06:47] Bitcoin um and so I I think that's
[06:50] really interesting um we're still super
[06:52] early days um but I think there's
[06:55] there's a really good chance that 20
[06:56] years out maybe not even that you know
[06:58] that far away that this is like the
[07:00] ultimate Finance case study and it was
[07:02] like you know the first the first you
[07:05] know public company um which I think you
[07:08] know has a chance on the other side of
[07:10] this uh you know Bitcoin is
[07:11] hyperbitcoinization Event Horizon to be
[07:13] one of the biggest companies in the
[07:15] world um you know and and really be a
[07:19] model for for every other uh Forward
[07:22] Thinking firm and maybe every every
[07:24] other firm eventually on the planet um
[07:26] as as what you know what is my Benchmark
[07:28] what is the ultimate like how am I
[07:30] measuring performance cuz right now a
[07:32] lot a lot of quote unquote performance
[07:34] or earnings or growth in in the stock
[07:38] market isn't growth at all it's it's you
[07:40] know this like this fake buyback you
[07:44] know adjusted performance or you know
[07:46] all of this like Fiat accounting
[07:47] gimmicks and um you know the hard hard
[07:51] money as a benchmark uh absolute
[07:54] scarcity these are these are very novel
[07:56] Concepts um and you know even even on a
[08:00] gold standard or even you know the fact
[08:01] that gold is this 1010 trillion asset
[08:03] that's that's been around for Millennia
[08:06] um there's never been a public company
[08:08] on a gold standard why right when has a
[08:11] public company ever said all our goal is
[08:13] to require as much gold as possible even
[08:14] the gold bugs even the gold bugs are
[08:18] passing out dividends in dollars right
[08:21] the go the gold miners are literally
[08:23] paying out dividend paying taxes paying
[08:26] out dividends to their investors who
[08:28] receive dividends and pay taxes income
[08:30] why aren't gold why aren't gold
[08:31] companies stacking gold in the balance
[08:33] sheet and diluting their Equity to buy
[08:35] gold wh and why why is that um so this
[08:39] is very radical um it flips the entire
[08:42] corporate world on its head and I think
[08:44] most people are just seeing it as as
[08:46] dumb luck still um which is fascinating
[08:49] you know a $500 million Enterprise Value
[08:53] goes to 40 billion in in four years like
[08:57] where where have you ever seen that um
[08:59] would no fundamental change outside of
[09:01] you know your accounting unit um you
[09:03] know and a and a you know corporate
[09:05] treasury team of 10 people like one of
[09:08] the most eye openening things that I had
[09:10] had and I was already you know
[09:12] intimately familiar with what what was
[09:14] happening in the mechanics behind it um
[09:16] but I was at the the micro strategy
[09:18] event um Bitcoin for corporations in in
[09:22] U May we're just talking to some people
[09:24] on their team and um you know one of the
[09:27] insights that was shared um was you know
[09:30] they like there's uh one of the members
[09:32] of the team was like there's there's
[09:33] 1,00 employees at micro strategy um 18
[09:37] and 1890 of them are working around the
[09:39] clock uh you know 247
[09:42] 365 uh to turn out you know what what is
[09:45] it 20 20 30 40 $50 million of of profit
[09:48] a year um which is great you know that's
[09:50] like you know that's that's a lot of
[09:52] money um you know business intelligence
[09:54] software Services um 10 the the 10
[09:58] people the Bitcoin team raise one
[10:01] convertible node
[10:02] issuance um for 500 or a bli you know
[10:06] maybe let's say a billion dollars um at
[10:09] 2% a year for six years at at a 40%
[10:12] conversion to the current share price
[10:15] and that that you know that's a creative
[10:17] in Bitcoin terms or you know just in
[10:19] terms of the the their you know
[10:21] Enterprise Value and you know 10 times
[10:24] over in in in a week what the entire
[10:28] rest of the and that's not a slight at
[10:30] the rest of the company at all it's
[10:33] that's more just saying that you know
[10:35] the fact that you're able to borrow Fiat
[10:37] for 2% for 7even years to buy an asset
[10:40] that's appreciating by x% over the next
[10:43] seven years and you know and you're
[10:45] selling your stock at a premium you're
[10:48] diluting your shares the shares are
[10:49] $1,000 today or $100 today you're
[10:51] selling shares at a future price of
[10:54] $1,400 or
[10:56] $140 right so like this Bitcoin per
[10:58] share a creative delution concept the
[11:01] fact that they're selling you know
[11:03] they're selling their stock volatility
[11:04] they're selling their stock at a future
[11:05] premium it would be a creative on a
[11:07] Bitcoin per share basis even if the
[11:08] stock traded one for one with their
[11:09] Bitcoin Holdings people are like oh once
[11:11] the premium collapses it's done it's
[11:13] like no no they could do the same thing
[11:16] and and accrete Bitcoin per share with
[11:17] the stock trading at 10 billion and
[11:19] their Bitcoin being worth 10 billion and
[11:21] the software business being worth
[11:23] nothing they could do the same thing um
[11:25] so I think like they I mean this this
[11:28] expecting every company to adopt the
[11:30] Sailor strategy and like going all in a
[11:33] little bit over advantageous um but
[11:36] expecting every company in the next 10
[11:37] years to have 1% of their Assets in
[11:39] Bitcoin and that 1% going to 5% or 10%
[11:42] eventually is like is a strong bet um
[11:45] and I think that we're just still in the
[11:46] super early phases of it the fact that
[11:48] like there are a few employees that do
[11:50] the big Bitcoin strategy uh reminded me
[11:52] of quote I think it was war Buffett
[11:55] maybe Charlie M maybe someone else uh
[11:57] it's better to think about money money
[12:00] uh one hour long then work for money one
[12:03] hour long and it's really interesting I
[12:05] think that that's a feared thing I feel
[12:08] like it it's like if we come to a
[12:10] Bitcoin world uh where like Bitcoin is
[12:12] actually the standard like decades in
[12:15] the future maybe hundreds years in the
[12:16] future whenever this this world comes
[12:19] then we're like in this world we like
[12:20] you just put proof of work in uh and you
[12:23] adopt the Bitcoin standard uh and and
[12:27] then maybe that that thing is not true
[12:29] anymore that you can do with with
[12:31] leverage and those fat games just like
[12:34] pulling up the the revenue from the next
[12:36] like 10 years and like have t Bitcoin
[12:38] already now uh that's like a a massive
[12:41] Fiat game it's really interesting to see
[12:44] um but right now we in this uh phase
[12:47] where the Bitcoin uh companies have
[12:51] Bitcoin and they putting on the balance
[12:52] sheet then we have some companies like
[12:54] micro strategy and others that have put
[12:56] Bitcoin on the balance sheet uh how do
[12:58] you invest like the the next few years
[13:01] of of adopting Bitcoin maybe also with
[13:03] the FP rule that is coming now and the
[13:06] Bitcoin ETF that we already had in in
[13:09] the past now uh and now kind of like it
[13:11] feels like we we built like a bucket uh
[13:14] where money can flow in and everything
[13:16] is kind of evolved around that and
[13:18] everything is getting ready I think like
[13:20] Michel Z even had like those those three
[13:21] points with the fast speed rules with
[13:23] like uh Banks uh allowing Bitcoin C and
[13:26] stuff like and we're coming closer to
[13:28] those three points reaching the things
[13:31] um how fundamental is that for like the
[13:33] the the coming 5 10 years yeah I um I me
[13:38] I think it's huge um a lot of you know
[13:40] maybe some people and I understand it um
[13:42] from like the cipher Punk or Anarchist
[13:44] perspective or saying like oh you're
[13:46] celebrating the banks or you know public
[13:48] companies or you know Black Rock buying
[13:51] you know buying Bitcoin on behalf of
[13:52] their clients and and for me it was kind
[13:54] of I I always thought it was inevitable
[13:56] and that doesn't I don't think that
[13:57] takes away from the the gray Market
[14:00] Black Market cypherpunk privacy you know
[14:03] like all everybody that's working on you
[14:06] know eash and second layer privacy
[14:08] Solutions and and you know all this
[14:10] other stuff doesn't doesn't take away
[14:12] from any of this like the other stuff
[14:14] happening doesn't stop that take away
[14:15] from it I think it actually puts more of
[14:17] a financial incentive upon all of the
[14:19] other stuff um but in terms of yeah like
[14:22] you have you have things coming down the
[14:24] pipe you have uh FB which has been
[14:26] adopted by a few companies that are
[14:28] first mover
[14:30] um micro strategy will probably be q1 I
[14:32] would say um you have the the Bitcoin
[14:35] ETF options um which yes you know you
[14:39] could say it's a Fiat you Fiat games um
[14:41] but the fact that you know the long the
[14:43] thing that's been said the most about
[14:45] Bitcoin as a as a you know the
[14:47] detractors would say it's too volatile
[14:49] and it doesn't produce cash flow you
[14:52] know those are the things that like you
[14:53] can't you know that that it's we can't
[14:56] invest in this right and there's going
[14:58] to be prods there's going to be
[14:59] synthetic products in you know week two
[15:01] of of these you know um ETF options
[15:04] rolling out where you can hold the you
[15:07] know income strategy ibid ETF and it
[15:11] gives you Bitcoin performance um but on
[15:13] the upside you don't you you you don't
[15:16] gain as much and on the downside it
[15:19] doesn't perform as poorly and you get a
[15:21] you get a dividend uh you know check
[15:23] every every month right because this ETF
[15:25] is structurally just selling call
[15:27] options selling call options selling
[15:29] call options and understand that's not
[15:30] Bitcoin in Cold Storage that there's no
[15:33] sovereignty component of that that's not
[15:35] you know that's not like this uh you
[15:38] know radical like that's more you know
[15:41] the quote unquote Fiat games but the the
[15:43] thing is that there there is T tens of
[15:47] trillions hundreds of trillions of
[15:49] dollars in this like fixed income Fiat
[15:52] world right and so if we're going to
[15:54] expect a hundred billion dollar or a
[15:55] trillion dollars to flow into Bitcoin
[15:57] products right you know which would
[16:00] create you know X trillions of dollars
[16:02] of market cap then you know stuff that
[16:05] that leverages bitcoin's volatility that
[16:07] leverages bitcoin's uncertainty and
[16:09] turns That Into You know to an income
[16:11] stream um is is a valuable product and
[16:15] people are going to undoubtedly use it
[16:17] right so for instance there's this mstr
[16:19] is like is micro strategy and is up 200%
[16:22] this year MST is a structured product
[16:26] that does that's not affiliated like
[16:28] micros strategy didn't uh wasn't
[16:30] involved with this it was a third party
[16:32] um and they this they're this uh yield
[16:34] max they're this um uh fund or this um
[16:39] entity on Wall Street that takes all you
[16:41] know Nvidia and apple and Tesla and big
[16:43] companies and then they put it into a
[16:46] product and then they sell call options
[16:48] they're they're selling covered calls
[16:49] and so you know if it's the price of a
[16:52] share is 100 bucks and I sell $120 call
[16:54] and the price goes to $140 well I'm
[16:56] still stuck with exposure at10 I left up
[16:59] some upside but if it's flat or if it's
[17:01] down you're you're selling you're
[17:03] selling Insurance you're selling call
[17:04] options that expire worthless every
[17:06] single week every single every single
[17:07] month right and so this MST product is
[17:11] like 100% annualized And I know
[17:14] technically it's not like a fixed income
[17:15] product with a fixed coupon it's it's
[17:17] variable but so you can't technically
[17:19] say annualized yield uh but this this
[17:22] msty product because mstr is so volatile
[17:26] is is spinning off a crazy amount of of
[17:29] uh income right and so all of a sudden
[17:32] these ibit options turn Bitcoin from and
[17:35] for me or you buy Spot Bitcoin for for
[17:38] really anybody that's interested in in
[17:40] uh you know just saving for their future
[17:42] just buy Spot Bitcoin hold it in C
[17:44] Storage but for like the baby boomer
[17:46] that like needs to live on his
[17:48] retirement and or you know whatever it
[17:51] may be like they they have a different
[17:52] sort of profile right like I sorry I
[17:55] need an income I can't I can't put all
[17:56] of my money into Bitcoin um something
[17:59] like that is is is going to be utilized
[18:01] and I think that these are all super
[18:04] interesting things so I think the the
[18:05] bank custody is going to unlock a ton uh
[18:08] a ton of just in continued institutional
[18:11] adoption as as ibit has become the best
[18:14] performing ETF um in history not not in
[18:18] performance but in terms of you know a
[18:20] to start um I think there's been a lot
[18:22] of institutional cover right like there
[18:24] was career risk for what sailor did he
[18:26] was a billionaire he was the longest
[18:28] tened CEO in the
[18:29] NASDAQ he didn't care you know he like I
[18:33] think he said he was going to just wrap
[18:34] it up and call call it quits retire and
[18:37] you know just hang out on Miami Beach
[18:39] every every day for the rest he he
[18:41] didn't really care career risk to him
[18:43] that I mean he he started this company
[18:45] from from nothing rode it up to you know
[18:49] multi-billion dollar wealth in the
[18:51] dotcom bubble and then literally micro
[18:53] strategy went down 99%
[18:55] 99.9% and he stuck with it for 20 years
[18:57] career risk you know who cares for him
[19:00] but for a lot of people like they're not
[19:02] running the company they started there's
[19:04] there's a ton of career risk you know oh
[19:06] you you adopted that thing that's a
[19:08] Ponzi scheme with no income what are you
[19:10] doing you know you're a you're a
[19:12] software company you're a medical device
[19:15] company what what are you thinking um
[19:16] but I bit Larry fin coming out and
[19:19] saying like you know Bitcoin is uh
[19:21] bigger than any government and it's like
[19:23] this this is this took out the
[19:25] institutional like career risk um the
[19:27] banks the bank s you know custody
[19:29] Bitcoin I think was always a natural um
[19:32] development um I think you know probably
[19:35] not soon but eventually these banks are
[19:37] going to figure out once they can
[19:38] custody at themselves that Bitcoin is
[19:40] the Best Collateral that there there's
[19:42] no there's no world where you should you
[19:45] know borrowing against Bitcoin over
[19:47] collateralized you know I give you $2 of
[19:49] Bitcoin and you give me a dollar of
[19:51] dollars um um that there's no world that
[19:55] that should be uh you know 10 11 12 15%
[19:58] interest rate as it's been throughout
[20:01] the last you know 3 four five years um
[20:04] when that's that's a risk-free loan
[20:06] right it's not risk- free in in Bitcoin
[20:08] terms you wouldn't lend me dollars
[20:09] because you have no interest in lending
[20:10] dollars um but the banks do that's their
[20:14] job and so you know the like I don't
[20:18] think people realize if if I have $20
[20:21] million of s&p500 shares and I'm you
[20:24] know I'm a a private client at Goldman
[20:27] Sachs I can borrow against my shares of
[20:30] stock for the you know Sofer the FED
[20:34] funds rate plus 50 bips plus you know I
[20:37] can borrow if the if risk-free rate
[20:39] risk-free rate is is 5% I can borrow for
[20:43] let's just call it 6% but for 1% over
[20:46] the risk-free rate and the bank's happy
[20:48] because they have collateral to make
[20:49] sure that they would never ever lose
[20:52] money on that deal they're just they're
[20:54] just taking a 1% interest rate and it's
[20:56] free money for them there's no reason
[20:58] Bitcoin shouldn't be the same and I
[21:00] would argue it will be the same right
[21:01] over collateralized Bitcoin lending is a
[21:03] zero loss business but that's been
[21:05] misconstrued by years of crypto schemes
[21:09] and and altcoins and counterparty risk
[21:12] and rehypothecation like Unchained
[21:14] Capital has been utilizing over
[21:16] collateralized Bitcoin loans since I
[21:19] believe 2017 they've underwritten um or
[21:22] they're not underwriting but they've
[21:23] provided a few hundred million dollars
[21:26] which isn't a lot but it's it's a lot
[21:27] for me and you
[21:29] hundred couple hundred million dollars
[21:30] of of loans against uh clients who take
[21:34] Bitcoin unchain doesn't re hypothecate
[21:36] it they actually you know if if you are
[21:38] the one borrowing and you pledge your
[21:39] Bitcoin you get one key of three in a
[21:41] multisig unchain capes a key and the and
[21:44] another third party keeps a key and so
[21:46] uh in the case that Bitcoin Falls 50% or
[21:49] 60% or whatever they they tap you on the
[21:51] shoulder you know and say hey put up
[21:53] more Bitcoin put up more Bitcoin you
[21:54] know just letting you know your
[21:56] collateral is running low if it falls
[21:58] enough and you don't put up any more
[21:59] collateral they do Margin Call they do
[22:02] make sure that you know once once
[22:04] they're you know $2 of Bitcoin against
[22:06] their $1 of of Lent um funds you know
[22:10] once your collateral goes to a120 or
[22:11] A110 they will liquidate it because
[22:14] they're not they're not interested in
[22:15] taking a loss right but as a result
[22:18] they've their loan book has had zero
[22:20] defaults right and so like if you think
[22:22] of the world of like if you think of the
[22:24] world of interest rates uh like of of
[22:26] lending right um interest rat rates are
[22:28] a compensation for for the risk right
[22:30] there's a reason that credit cards are
[22:32] 20 20 25% right because it's unsecured
[22:36] and a certain amount of borrowers rack
[22:38] up credit card debt and then you know
[22:41] disappear they don't pay it right and so
[22:44] the the banks the lenders have to bake
[22:45] in a default rate right automobile loans
[22:48] right well if you don't pay then they're
[22:50] going to repo your car but the car is
[22:51] depreciated it's banged up maybe it's
[22:53] gone missing you know the engine's gone
[22:56] like there's there's all these things
[22:57] with a with a with a mortgage they can
[22:59] repo your house right but it takes a
[23:02] year there's this whole process so the
[23:05] recovery rate um is one thing to think
[23:07] about and then also like the time to
[23:09] liquidate the recovery rate for an over
[23:11] coller's Bitcoin loan is 100% and the
[23:14] and the and the time to liquidate
[23:17] is 10 minutes you know like like and so
[23:21] that that the banks adopting Bitcoin as
[23:23] you know custody they're not coming out
[23:25] and saying we're offering over
[23:26] collateralized Bitcoin loans to
[23:27] everybody but when caner Fitzgerald says
[23:29] hey we have $2 billion of of financing
[23:32] for anybody interested in borrowing
[23:33] against their Bitcoin you know caner
[23:35] like that's that's a big deal and so all
[23:37] these Banks coming and and eventually
[23:39] custody Bitcoin you best believe that
[23:41] Bitcoin gets entrenched further into the
[23:45] the world of you know of Wall Street
[23:49] into the world of of finance and so that
[23:52] many people would think like this is a
[23:54] bad thing and I would say that this is
[23:56] always an after progression Bitcoin Co
[23:58] in this world becomes increasingly tied
[24:01] to liquidity to Global liquidity it
[24:04] becomes increasingly correlated to the
[24:05] S&P 500 and the NASDAQ and all these
[24:07] risk assets and inversely correlated to
[24:10] the dollar and I would say that you know
[24:12] eventually if we if we walk this path
[24:14] forward Bitcoin is what trillion and a
[24:16] half now if it gets 10 times bigger to
[24:18] 15 trillion wherever you know you can be
[24:21] a lot higher or maybe a little lower
[24:23] think about what what that means in the
[24:25] case of a 40 50 60 70% brought down
[24:30] think about what that means it means
[24:31] that Bitcoin is no longer just this
[24:32] little bubble you know that that kids
[24:34] are playing with in the side pool right
[24:37] like Bitcoin is the is the real real
[24:39] game and and what happens every single
[24:42] time there's a meaningful draw down in
[24:45] household wealth and and and you know
[24:48] and anytime there's an asset bubble that
[24:49] goes burst with sufficient size 2 Tech
[24:52] bubble housing bubble GFC like sovereign
[24:56] debt there's always a bailout and it's
[25:00] that's not it's not a bailout because
[25:02] they they want to it's because they have
[25:04] to it's because Global solvy with all
[25:07] this debt once assets start to liquidate
[25:10] and there's this compounding this
[25:12] compounding feedback loop the the world
[25:15] is functionally insolvent so what do
[25:17] they do they print a bunch of money buy
[25:19] up all the the toxic assets and
[25:21] reinflated and so the banks customing
[25:24] Bitcoin and you know to a certain extent
[25:26] like also the you know just fby
[25:28] accounting and all this other stuff on
[25:30] the corporate side but Bitcoin slowly
[25:32] just kind of Trojan horsing its way onto
[25:35] the asset side of the global balance
[25:36] sheet is absolutely a bullish bullish
[25:39] sign um and it's just I think the
[25:41] natural progression of everything um and
[25:44] uh yeah I think so so while that's not
[25:47] like stated right away outright it's not
[25:49] like oh uh they're adopting you know
[25:51] Bitcoin to custody and they're also
[25:53] going to be offering finan in collateral
[25:55] if you don't think that's coming you
[25:56] don't understand like why they are so in
[25:58] this in the first place um because they
[26:01] I mean they they've seen the Black Rock
[26:03] ETF shatter records They know where this
[26:05] is all going they're I think this The
[26:08] Savvy ones are slowly starting to wake
[26:09] up to this this fact uh and they don't
[26:12] want to be left behind um so I think I'm
[26:14] super bullish on it all um I think that
[26:16] the corporate story is super interesting
[26:18] um and and still extremely
[26:20] misunderstood um and and bitcoin's
[26:23] volatility is one of the things that
[26:25] unlocks all of this stuff um and and
[26:28] that's people are starting to realize
[26:29] especially in the case of like sailor
[26:31] strategy that the volatility is not a
[26:33] it's not a bug it's a feature and it's
[26:35] it's a tool to be
[26:36] leveraged yeah absolutely and and I
[26:40] think uh whenever we are talking about
[26:42] corporate leverage and and all those uh
[26:44] games that are played uh on that level I
[26:47] think we have to at least quickly also
[26:49] talk about that same thing on the
[26:52] invidual level on uh the the normal
[26:55] people that have maybe like 0.1 Bitcoin
[26:58] maybe even have like three or four
[26:59] Bitcoin or a little bit more than that
[27:01] uh but they don't have like a massive
[27:03] multi-billion dollar company like micro
[27:06] strategy on those things is in their
[27:09] case uh a leverage no matter how big or
[27:13] small that is in any way uh sense like
[27:17] does it make sense to even adopt like uh
[27:20] credits on on an individual basis for
[27:22] Bitcoin maybe like you see like
[27:24] especially now with the expected bull
[27:26] run the next like 12 to 18 months like
[27:28] okay I can buy now so many Bitcoin in 18
[27:30] months probably I can buy just like a
[27:32] fraction of that Bitcoin why not take
[27:34] like a 20,000 year loan or like 50,000
[27:37] year loan and buy Bitcoin now with that
[27:39] and just buy uh just pay off the adapt
[27:43] uh within the next like 12 18 months uh
[27:45] is there anything to it or is the are
[27:47] most people better off just like buying
[27:48] spot Bitcoin yeah yeah that's a great
[27:51] question um you know I would say be be
[27:53] weary uh or careful on anything that you
[27:57] know puts your Bitcoin at risk right so
[28:00] we're talking about Bitcoin as
[28:01] collateral loans just 5 minutes ago um
[28:04] you know the the wealthy don't sell
[28:08] assets never sell assets um they just
[28:11] borrow against them right so you're not
[28:13] going to sell your $20 million of S&P
[28:15] 500 stock if you need a five $5 million
[28:17] you're just going to borrow against it
[28:19] um you're not going to you know I think
[28:21] Sor said this multiple times like you're
[28:23] not going to you never sell your block
[28:25] of Manhattan real estate you just
[28:26] Finance against it to buy the the next
[28:28] one
[28:29] um you you know you don't you shouldn't
[28:32] sell your Bitcoin um but you also
[28:35] shouldn't be ever put yourself in a spot
[28:37] where you're forced to sell a Bitcoin
[28:39] not because you want to because you have
[28:41] two Bitcoin and you you you Bitcoin
[28:45] $60,000 and you put those two Bitcoin
[28:48] all your entire stack into a an app or a
[28:51] bank in Theo bank and you borrowed
[28:53] 60,000
[28:55] USD uh and you and you maybe bought
[28:57] another Bitcoin or did whatever with it
[28:59] and all of a sudden you know there's
[29:01] this covid style crash and Bitcoin goes
[29:03] from 60,000 just briefly to 30 34,000
[29:08] and and just to preface this I don't I
[29:09] don't think that's going to happen here
[29:11] but just just for the sake of the
[29:12] hypothetical scenario and that's in that
[29:14] case Bitcoin could have could have been
[29:16] to that level just for 3 minutes and
[29:20] never returned again yet you were forced
[29:23] to sell everything at 34,000 or 30 or
[29:26] whatever that was because you had a
[29:28] liquidation and you got tapped on the
[29:30] shoulder by that app and they said hey
[29:32] please send more Bitcoin or else like
[29:33] you know we have no choice this was this
[29:35] was the agreement because they they are
[29:37] have zero interest in in taking
[29:39] directional exposure they're just taking
[29:41] you know they're just loaning you and
[29:42] and you know if you don't put up the
[29:43] collateral then that's their job um and
[29:46] so in that scenario right like you were
[29:48] bullish on bitcoin you get the thesis
[29:49] you get everything right you even
[29:52] stacked more Bitcoin with your Bitcoin
[29:53] like that's the intention and then you
[29:56] were forced to sell everything at the
[29:57] low right and so I think there's a lot
[29:59] of there's a lot of uh you know kind of
[30:01] there's plenty of people that have like
[30:03] horror stories like that I mean there's
[30:05] similarly like you know that that story
[30:07] can be summed up by people trading
[30:09] leverage on binance right I I wouldn't
[30:12] encourage that for anybody um but you
[30:15] know it's it's one thing if you have a
[30:17] ton of cash flow a ton of assets you're
[30:20] super solvent and you take a tenth of of
[30:23] your stack or a hundredth of your stack
[30:25] and you you know borrow against it so
[30:26] you don't have to sell anything right
[30:28] you can you know use that you can use a
[30:30] little bit of that collateral to you
[30:32] know um purchase a home or do whatever
[30:35] right and and and you know that even if
[30:37] Bitcoin goes down 80% there's not a
[30:40] there's not one world out there where
[30:42] you would ever have to be you know
[30:43] forcibly sell everything at the worst
[30:44] time um but on the other hand I would
[30:48] say there Dollars currency is
[30:52] fungible um your on your balance sheet
[30:55] is all fungible and so if you're if
[30:57] you're you know there's many people out
[30:59] there um that have let's just say in the
[31:01] US um that have
[31:04] a 2 and a half% mortgage for 20 26 more
[31:09] years right people say don't borrow
[31:12] against your Bitcoin or don't borrow to
[31:14] buy Bitcoin okay fine conventional wisdm
[31:16] it's too volatile it's risky don't
[31:17] borrow to buy Bitcoin fine well if I'm
[31:19] sitting here and I have a a 2 and a
[31:21] half% mortgage for
[31:23] $500,000 and I have you know a house
[31:25] that I have against that um and I buy
[31:29] Bitcoin with my cash like I have on my
[31:33] balance sheet I have a house I have
[31:35] Bitcoin and I have a $500,000 mortgage
[31:37] my tradeoff of buying that Bitcoin was
[31:39] paying off the mortgage paying off that
[31:40] principal right so you're not borrowing
[31:42] to buy Bitcoin but you indirectly are
[31:45] like you have credit card debt and
[31:46] student loans and on your asset side you
[31:48] have Bitcoin and bank account cash like
[31:53] you you didn't borrow to buy Bitcoin
[31:55] explicitly but dollars are funable so
[31:57] you did
[31:58] right and so like the calculus and I I
[32:01] would you know like definitely not 25%
[32:04] credit card rate but if you have let's
[32:06] just say like 5% student loan debt right
[32:11] and that's you know eating away at you
[32:13] you know and you know that this is this
[32:16] is unsecured and you have to pay it off
[32:17] eventually um but it could be meaningful
[32:20] or not you know if you if you just buy
[32:22] Bitcoin with a DCA for five bucks a day
[32:25] like you are indirectly borrowing to buy
[32:27] Bitcoin you don't realize it it's not
[32:29] it's not you're not putting your Bitcoin
[32:30] as collateral which is even you know
[32:32] even better um but that's you know
[32:34] that's indirectly unofficially what's
[32:36] happening you are quite literally like
[32:38] speculative attacking the dollar you
[32:40] have a leverage balance sheet to buy
[32:41] Bitcoin right so like again that I don't
[32:45] think every you should I'm not
[32:46] encouraging anybody to borrow money to
[32:48] buy Bitcoin um but if you have a
[32:50] mortgage and you own Bitcoin you've
[32:51] you've borrowed money to buy Bitcoin
[32:53] your tradeoff to buying that Bitcoin was
[32:54] paying off your mortgage you didn't you
[32:56] didn't do that in full um so I think
[32:58] there's smart there's smart leverage I
[32:59] don't think when when the 30-year debt
[33:02] you know 30-year rate in the US is
[33:05] 4% this is outside of Bitcoin it makes
[33:08] no sense to pay off more than than just
[33:11] bare minimum on your 2 and a half%
[33:13] mortgage right and so like if you what
[33:16] if you know if you have any sort of debt
[33:18] out there that you know reasonably you
[33:21] you know you can service if you need to
[33:23] you're not you're not strained in a
[33:24] position where like you're buying
[33:26] Bitcoin so much that you're going to
[33:27] nuke your credit score or all of your
[33:29] personal finances otherwise or get your
[33:31] your house or your car repossessed um
[33:34] but you know if if you're evaluating the
[33:37] tradeoff and you and you know that let's
[33:39] just say it's unsecured debt and you
[33:41] know this this interest rate's 5% and
[33:43] you're you have some some level of
[33:46] confidence whether irrational or not
[33:48] that Bitcoin might outpace 5% a year for
[33:50] the next X amount of a period of time
[33:54] you know that's that's an opportunity
[33:55] cost or a decision everybody has to make
[33:59] but I mean I've certainly made that
[34:00] decision in the past and and I think you
[34:02] know most people have without even
[34:04] knowing it maybe right um I think it it
[34:07] you know in a especially in a world
[34:09] where like if we ever see what we kind
[34:11] of expect to happen over what's already
[34:13] happened but also over the next 5 or 10
[34:15] years like that will be a good decision
[34:17] I mean people people in
[34:19] hyperinflationary periods the people
[34:20] that get rich or get even you know are
[34:24] already rich and get way richer are the
[34:26] people that are short
[34:28] the devaluing currency and long any hard
[34:31] assets like in wear Germany all these
[34:34] industrialists got Filthy Rich because
[34:38] they were they they took they borrowed
[34:40] every single Mark they could and bought
[34:42] gold or factories or whatever it was um
[34:47] so I think like it is entirely different
[34:49] when we're talking about micro strategy
[34:50] we're talking about the corporate level
[34:52] um it's entirely different to you know
[34:54] borrowing as as a public company with
[34:56] with liquid common stock versus an
[34:58] individual um for instance metop Planet
[35:01] borrowed a billion yen which is like $7
[35:03] million um twice one one for one year
[35:06] and one for six months um and has has
[35:08] paid down the six-month loan with uh
[35:11] with an issuance of of stock acquisition
[35:12] rights um and there's a $10 billion
[35:15] issurance of stock acquisition rights um
[35:16] a bunch of that went to buying Bitcoin
[35:18] one of that went to paying down some of
[35:19] the debt right so you know I I can't
[35:23] issue shares of Dylan you can't issue
[35:24] shares of Rob like you we that's that's
[35:26] not a that's not that can be done micro
[35:29] strategy at book if it's trading at 10
[35:31] billion and it's Bitcoin is worth 10
[35:32] billion they can dilute common stock
[35:37] Bitcoin per share won't go up because
[35:38] it's trading at one to one but their
[35:40] debt solvency ratios improve so the
[35:42] dilution even even at a at a point if
[35:45] with the valuation where Bitcoin per
[35:46] share is not going anywhere it's flat
[35:49] aggregate Bitcoin is increasing and and
[35:51] your debt ratios are improving your s
[35:53] your solvency ratios are improving so
[35:55] it's not just a Bitcoin per share thing
[35:56] it's also this this this kind of this
[35:58] game with like solvency right it's like
[36:01] the interest the interest payment but
[36:03] also in the in the case of liquidation
[36:05] you know how much how many assets do you
[36:07] have to cover your liabilities so I
[36:09] think that the calculus for an
[36:10] individual has to be different than a
[36:11] public company um or you know an
[36:14] institution but um you know I would say
[36:18] outside of just pledging all of your
[36:21] Bitcoin to
[36:22] borrow there there is there is smart
[36:26] leverage um and especially for the
[36:28] people with like you know a house maybe
[36:30] that's fully paid off or or you know
[36:33] this long mortgage right that that is
[36:35] borrowing to buy Bitcoin it's just a
[36:37] kind of a roundabout way to think about
[36:38] it if you watch or listen to my podcast
[36:41] on a regular basis I guess you already
[36:44] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[36:46] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[36:49] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[36:52] personal recommendation for Hardware
[36:53] wallet is the bit box it's super secure

[37:57] new for you guys I partnered up with
[38:00] coin vigilante this is the most
[38:03] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[38:06] saw created by anyone look at that
[38:08] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[38:11] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[38:14] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[38:17] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[38:20] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[38:24] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[38:26] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[38:30] watch collections you have the date of
[38:32] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[38:36] there and of course also the block
[38:38] height and which EPO we are currently in
[38:41] I love the level of detail they put in
[38:44] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[38:47] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[38:49] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[38:52] love those watches so so much it's also
[38:55] interesting um that we can utilize that
[38:59] fat game to make Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
[39:03] Community stronger basically that's
[39:05] that's what micro strategy is doing what
[39:06] what all the companies are doing uh
[39:08] they're pulling from fat to bitcoin it's
[39:11] like that that that the dark uh uh dark
[39:14] hold the the the hold that comes in the
[39:17] feeld and makes Bitcoin stronger um
[39:20] let's zoom out really really far um like
[39:24] first of all do you think that fat games
[39:26] will always be there is is is feat
[39:28] always something that will be with us or
[39:31] is at some point Bitcoin the the world
[39:35] res of currency asset and those games is
[39:38] just like a very long transition phase
[39:40] where we transition from like Fiat to
[39:42] bitcoin stand up maybe or is it just
[39:45] that we have Bitcoin as this exit weal
[39:48] that we can flee to but feeld will
[39:51] always be there the those uh credit
[39:53] markets will always be there uh once we
[39:56] get to like oh no Bitcoin is just not A1
[39:58] trillion doll asset but it's like a a
[40:01] 200 400 trillion like a really big asset
[40:04] um where maybe just it's the only uh
[40:07] currency or asset like that um how does
[40:11] it look then yeah I mean I think it's
[40:13] important to note that a lot of the
[40:15] stuff we're talking about with micro
[40:16] strategy I think and they would even I'm
[40:18] sure they've even said it Sailors even
[40:20] said it I'm sure they would state it
[40:22] again that this they they know a lot of
[40:24] this is like a temporary phase
[40:26] transition right right it's like it's
[40:28] like this Arbitrage on uh the transition
[40:31] state um you know I don't think there if
[40:34] we if we're 50 years from in the future
[40:37] I don't think there will just be
[40:39] like I don't think it's fair to say a
[40:40] money glitch but I I I don't think
[40:42] there's just this world where you can
[40:44] just like print common stock buy Bitcoin
[40:45] and it's just like this this feedback
[40:47] loop um that that no one else has caught
[40:50] up on um I think that you know
[40:52] eventually Bitcoin gets so large and and
[40:56] all this stuff become so understood and
[40:58] people understand more particularly
[41:00] because this is an Arbitrage on
[41:01] basically the cost of capital right
[41:03] Bitcoin doesn't have an interest rate
[41:05] but it's this proof of work you know uh
[41:10] uh this that's you know ever ratcheting
[41:12] up production cost marginal production
[41:14] cost with the difficulty adjustment and
[41:16] proof of work mining um and with
[41:18] absolute scarcity that you know against
[41:21] this centrally controlled system that
[41:23] has a cost of capital that may or may
[41:25] not outpace the inflation rate right and
[41:27] so it's this is kind of like this this
[41:28] phase transition Arbitrage if we're
[41:32] thinking about 50 years from now I think
[41:33] that um you know if if you asked me four
[41:36] years ago in 2020 um as I once I really
[41:38] got the thesis and I read the sovereign
[41:41] individual and a bunch of these books
[41:42] and I was like all right you know Fiat
[41:44] has a few years left you know at best um
[41:47] and I would say that that was um you
[41:49] know I I don't I no longer believe that
[41:51] but at the same time I think that um you
[41:54] know Fiat will be around for a long time
[41:56] but not in its current state of
[41:58] importance um and I say that as in and
[42:02] this isn't the best analogy but may
[42:04] maybe it works um like basically every
[42:07] other currency in the world except the
[42:09] dollar um but you know a lot of the G7
[42:11] currencies and even a lot of the
[42:12] Emerging Market currencies are basically
[42:14] more or less like dollar derivatives
[42:16] right and you know when the FED says
[42:19] jump they say how high um and you know
[42:22] if fed Cuts or fed loosens then you know
[42:24] they're more or less following and their
[42:26] inflation is isn't even their own
[42:28] domestic economies inflation it's
[42:31] basically just Global inflation and
[42:33] they're kind of at the whims of
[42:34] everything else um and really it's like
[42:36] the dollar Capital markets USD Capital
[42:38] markets and the fed and our rates that
[42:42] set that set not only their their
[42:44] currency but their rates too right I
[42:47] think we get to a world where Bitcoin if
[42:49] we're thinking about it as1 trillion
[42:50] dollar $200 trillion Fiat could still
[42:54] exist the I would I'm much more
[42:56] confident in the dollar than I am of the
[42:57] Euro um as a as a kind of currency block
[43:01] with all these nations that are
[43:03] supposedly Sovereign kind of pegged to
[43:04] this like you know um you know EU
[43:07] Authority so I I don't I don't I
[43:09] wouldn't with confidence say that the
[43:11] Euro and its current state is is out you
[43:13] know uh two decades from now um but you
[43:16] know the USD I could certainly see a
[43:18] world where uh Bitcoin it's a story
[43:21] value Asset it's it's it's increasingly
[43:24] being used maybe in developing markets
[43:26] and in Western worlds as a medium of
[43:29] exchange and uni of account by um by
[43:32] companies or individuals um but the
[43:34] dollar is still exists um but is is
[43:39] restraint in a way that it's not today
[43:41] deficit spending by politicians is is
[43:44] restrained or constrained by the reality
[43:47] that they know like right now Congress
[43:51] doesn't think twice they don't blink
[43:52] about another hundred billion dollar of
[43:55] foreign aid of of another you know
[43:58] trillion dollars of military spending of
[44:01] of you know entitlements welfare
[44:03] Whatever It Is Write it off um it does
[44:06] doesn't matter rack up another trillion
[44:07] in debt who cares who's counting um in a
[44:10] world where Bitcoin is is not a trillion
[44:12] but it's is two orders of magnitude
[44:14] larger is aund trillion dollar every
[44:17] single and I think it's already there's
[44:19] already Savvy people there's already the
[44:21] people watching this podcast and me and
[44:23] you who are saying oh they just issued
[44:25] another trillion in debt like you know I
[44:28] I should value my Bitcoin higher
[44:29] mentally right um in dollar terms um I
[44:32] think that once Bitcoin gets to
[44:34] sufficient size every and and you know
[44:37] you have maybe let's say 10 companies or
[44:40] 100 companies doing what what micro
[44:43] strategy is doing at size at massive
[44:45] size and you have hedge funds like you
[44:48] know and people like Ray doio and Paul
[44:50] tutor Jones and Stanley Dr and Miller
[44:52] that are that are going to their Goldman
[44:54] private you know financing and saying
[44:56] you know give me I'm borrowing $500
[44:58] million to do what no bu buy Bitcoin um
[45:01] and you have like like this is happening
[45:03] at a massive scale and banks are
[45:04] utilizing Bitcoin as collateral and like
[45:06] you know basically what we went were
[45:08] talking about 15 minutes ago on on
[45:10] bitcoin as collateral entrenching itself
[45:12] in that world the dollar like Bitcoin is
[45:16] the check right Bitcoin the exchange
[45:18] rate of Bitcoin is like this the alarm
[45:20] Bell and it we we would say it already
[45:21] is but it's not sufficient size to truly
[45:25] to truly matter yet um versus in in a
[45:28] world where Bitcoin is 100 times larger
[45:30] if Congress says oh you know we we we
[45:33] thought we were going to run 1% deficits
[45:35] this year we're going to run 10%
[45:36] deficits bit Bitcoin moons like on that
[45:39] on that day right it's like you know in
[45:42] the same way that you know like when
[45:44] markets are forward-looking and you know
[45:46] when when the FED Governor you know
[45:48] changes his tune or comes out in a
[45:50] different color tie and markets go up or
[45:52] down and react and or like oh there was
[45:55] a there's a 50 basis point cut and
[45:56] everyone everyone expected a 25 basis
[45:58] point cut and so the nasdaq's up 2% and
[46:02] then bitcoin's up and the Dollar's down
[46:03] and interest rates are whatever right
[46:05] like if we think of a world where
[46:06] Bitcoin like the dollar can still exist
[46:09] the dollar can still be a you know
[46:11] everybody could be using it and maybe
[46:13] they're forcibly mandated to get pay to
[46:15] get paid in it and pay taxes in it who
[46:17] knows um but the the The Reckless
[46:22] deficit spending and and all the stuff
[46:24] that we just kind of accept as as the
[46:26] state of Affairs today would be by
[46:30] definition constrained by the fact that
[46:32] everybody knows that that this is the
[46:35] alternative and if you're going to like
[46:37] just continue to debase me then we're
[46:39] just going to flee right capital's just
[46:41] going to seamlessly transition and the
[46:43] this the thing is you know like China or
[46:46] or a you know some a country that's
[46:48] maybe like authoritarian or or communist
[46:50] or whatever they can they can close
[46:52] their Capital markets and say no you
[46:54] can't leave right if you want to be the
[46:56] global Reser currency you cannot close
[46:58] your Capital markets and I think that's
[47:00] what people are starting that's why
[47:01] there's been such an Embrace of Bitcoin
[47:03] in the past few years by you know what
[47:05] people would say that is establishment
[47:07] even you know like the the Trump
[47:08] campaign you know if you think about
[47:10] what JD Vance and Trump's platform is is
[47:14] we need we need to resore manufacturing
[47:17] we need to weaken the dollar and they're
[47:19] also you know bull po posting about
[47:21] Bitcoin those things aren't
[47:23] unrelated right we need to reun our
[47:26] Manufacturing we're going to throw
[47:27] tariffs on everybody we're going to
[47:29] weaken the dollar that's what you need
[47:30] to do to re reent manufacturing we're
[47:32] going to weaken the dollar relative to
[47:34] China and Japan and and Singapore and
[47:37] and Indonesia and blank blank blank and
[47:41] Bitcoin is part of the policy platform
[47:43] why well it's not just the fact that
[47:45] there's now like crypto lobbying money
[47:48] it's the fact that like you know the
[47:49] Peter the Peter teal types and like
[47:52] those you know kind of Silicon Valley
[47:53] types know that in that in that world
[47:57] there's going to be an escape there's
[47:58] going to be a liquidity valve there's
[48:00] going to be kind of this like you know
[48:02] this this um yeah this this liquidity
[48:05] you know check and Bitcoin is that thing
[48:07] um and so yeah like I I I wouldn't be
[48:12] surprised in a world where if we're 50
[48:13] years from now Bitcoin I mean I I sort
[48:15] of kind of expect Bitcoin to be this
[48:19] store value medium exchange uni of
[48:21] account um but at the same time I you
[48:23] know I the Monopoly on State uh the
[48:27] Monopoly on violence and the the reality
[48:29] of the state I don't think collapses and
[48:32] I would have I would have said I would
[48:33] think that four years ago um someone's
[48:36] going to be controlling the new codes
[48:38] some you know someone's going to have
[48:40] the the the bombers and whatnot that
[48:42] doesn't stop Bitcoin from existing um
[48:44] but what that does mean is that there is
[48:46] a there is somewhere you know along the
[48:49] chain a kind of a control of of of
[48:52] violence and a control of um the State
[48:55] of Affairs and so does that can that all
[48:58] operate without a a fiat currency well I
[49:00] guess that's a big question um but what
[49:02] I do think Bitcoin being super valuable
[49:04] means is that at least the relative
[49:07] level of that power gets checked gets
[49:10] put in its place and so I think that the
[49:12] the size of the bureaucratic State and
[49:15] the the EU and DC and you know like I
[49:18] think that the the power that they have
[49:19] relatively gets gets shrunken um by that
[49:23] I don't think it goes away completely
[49:27] it's interesting because the the before
[49:30] I started the podcast I also thought oh
[49:32] Fiat will be gone like I was like Fiat
[49:34] will be gone in within a few years or
[49:36] maybe like a decade or something like
[49:37] that and the more I speak with Bitcoin
[49:39] as the more realistic my view on on the
[49:41] actual thing gets and uh that right now
[49:46] like I I think it might be possible in
[49:48] the future if we think of like very far
[49:51] uh but I don't think I will see that in
[49:53] my lifetime maybe we get to a state
[49:56] where we can upload our identity but
[49:58] that's a whole another discussion but if
[50:00] we think of a normal lifetime I think
[50:02] that will not happen um before we come
[50:04] to the end routine one last question you
[50:06] mentioned it uh how big or like if at
[50:09] all will the the US election impact
[50:13] anything in Bitcoin I feel like when I
[50:15] talk with some Bitcoin I say like oh
[50:16] when Trump wins that and that happens
[50:18] but at that same time like I don't know
[50:20] like we had a CA Harris Administration
[50:23] already because she's the vice president
[50:25] yeah uh and bit went okay the last four
[50:28] years will there there be any uh
[50:32] fundamental change to I don't know bitco
[50:34] price to the the regulatory Frameworks
[50:37] or policies in America whether Trump or
[50:40] Harris yeah I mean I think the uh I mean
[50:43] Trump's more of a bullish candidate um I
[50:47] think there would be some form of I
[50:49] don't know if you'd want to call it
[50:50] strategic Reserve or not um but I think
[50:53] it's more it was more than just lip
[50:55] service um despite how you know I was
[50:59] that was there National for the talk uh
[51:01] it was more of a standard Trump rally
[51:02] than it was a Bitcoin maximalist
[51:04] Manifesto like I mean obviously um but
[51:08] uh yeah I I think that um it would be
[51:11] super bullish the fact I think really
[51:14] it's more the fact that the potential I
[51:17] mean the previous and the potential
[51:18] future leader of the Free World uh
[51:21] Donald Trump is I mean and he tweets a
[51:23] lot of things but he's you know posting
[51:26] on social which evidently gets seen by
[51:28] everybody everywhere um you know Bitcoin
[51:31] Bitcoin mining uh needs to stay in
[51:33] America we need our energy Independence
[51:36] and we can't let our enemies and our you
[51:38] know geostrategic or our geopolitical um
[51:42] adversaries have it and so if you think
[51:44] about it like I it was interesting I was
[51:46] on a Twitter spaces with Matthew Pines
[51:49] um who's a you know National Security uh
[51:52] consultant adviser um and and kind of
[51:54] does a lot of this geopolitical game
[51:56] theory talks about great powers and
[51:57] whatnot and he was
[51:59] saying do you guys realize that that you
[52:02] know off the off the hip truth social
[52:05] post at 1:00 a.m. was circulated by
[52:08] every Intelligence Agency on the planet
[52:11] like like you know the people that are
[52:13] game planning you know the the con or
[52:17] not a conflict but the you know that are
[52:19] in China's intelligence agencies are
[52:21] that are in you know Iranian and Russian
[52:24] Intel are are s saying what did he just
[52:27] say like and so that e even if Trump
[52:30] loses even if you know that just that
[52:32] conversation didn't exist four years ago
[52:34] I mean may maybe like on the fringes
[52:36] right but at a trillion dollars H you
[52:39] know how big and robust the mining
[52:41] industry is um I think people realize
[52:44] that like you know B Bhutan has has like
[52:47] half their GDP in Bitcoin reserves right
[52:51] like they have like 13,000 Bitcoin or I
[52:53] think it's like a quarter of their GDP
[52:55] um per year they have just on an Bitcoin
[52:58] huddled on their balance sheet right so
[53:00] like that's for small Nations but for
[53:01] big Nations for for Russia who just cut
[53:03] off Swift you don't think they've
[53:06] they've evaluated every alternative you
[53:07] don't think that they've they're already
[53:09] covertly accepting Bitcoin or maybe even
[53:11] have a little bit of a stash um so in
[53:14] terms of the election I think that I
[53:16] mean Trump's obviously more of a pro
[53:17] Bitcoin candidate um the rhetoric itself
[53:19] is super meaningful potential for a
[53:22] strategic Reserve or just not selling
[53:24] the Bitcoin they acquired is is huge um
[53:27] I honestly think that it would be the
[53:31] the in in a Harris Administration or a
[53:34] trump Administration it's it's there's a
[53:36] bigger relative impact on crypto I would
[53:40] say like Bitcoin has solidified itself
[53:42] it's commodity the SEC has no
[53:44] jurisdiction if Calo wins like crypto is
[53:49] go I I would you know is going to be
[53:51] there's going to be a lot of you know
[53:53] fall fall back um from that you know
[53:56] secur it's just like the Securities
[53:58] regulation and all that stuff kind of
[54:00] the hammer is going to come down I would
[54:01] say um more so relatively than than
[54:05] Trump um and like I'm you know I'm a bit
[54:08] agnostic to it all um I'm you know I
[54:10] don't really care or Focus my time on
[54:13] altcoins but um I mean it's obvious like
[54:17] the Trump sphere of influence is
[54:19] literally launching like a fork of D5 on
[54:22] a like I think it's I think it's stupid
[54:26] um
[54:26] you know that doesn't really like change
[54:28] my overall opinion on many things but
[54:30] like if Trump gets in like it's more or
[54:34] less free game um For Better or Worse um
[54:39] on on that stuff because like if he
[54:41] doesn't then like you they're absolutely
[54:43] going to bring about charges against
[54:45] World Liberty coin or whatever else
[54:48] right like obviously that's just that
[54:49] the state of political Affairs um and so
[54:52] I think it's it's more relatively
[54:54] impactful despite I think it being
[54:55] somewhat kind of ir relevant longterm
[54:58] the X Bitcoin crypto uh bucket I think
[55:02] it's relatively more important for
[55:04] crypto than it is for Bitcoin um but I
[55:06] think it still is W like you know wildly
[55:09] important and impactful for Bitcoin
[55:11] itself because I think you know once he
[55:12] gets in that we're going to have like
[55:15] you know there's going to be some
[55:15] bitcoiners like in the cabinet we're
[55:18] going to have you know eyes on the
[55:19] inside and I think the roric is going to
[55:22] continue to be strong um but either way
[55:24] I think this was the this was the first
[55:26] time Bitcoin even if it was still a
[55:28] minor issue was you know at at the big
[55:30] rallies or at the debates there was no
[55:31] talk of Bitcoin that's fine um but it
[55:34] was never once mentioned in 2020 um so I
[55:37] think by 2028 there will be sort of a
[55:40] bipartisan consensus that this is
[55:42] important this shouldn't go away and
[55:43] it's one because the size of the voting
[55:45] block but but more importantly I would
[55:47] say this is just the reality of politics
[55:50] uh it's the the the just how big of a a
[55:54] punch uh the crypto Lobby packs in terms
[55:57] of donations I mean it's like it's just
[56:00] like a a disproportionate outsized
[56:02] amount of of funding um from the the
[56:05] Bitcoin crypto Lobby and so like if
[56:07] we're thinking about 2028 even if let's
[56:10] just say we're at $62,000 but I don't
[56:12] think we are in terms of bitcoin's price
[56:14] um I mean that this is a one-way street
[56:17] right it's the and I think also
[56:20] importantly enough like for me for you
[56:23] the orange pill Journey like once you
[56:25] realize like the the game theory and the
[56:27] the the kind of the the motion that's
[56:30] already in place um for Bitcoin adoption
[56:32] you know you realize like or your mental
[56:34] model completely wipes away that like oh
[56:36] it's going to zero argument but for a
[56:38] lot of people like they're thinking
[56:40] about this and they're like well it
[56:41] could go to zero right and I think that
[56:44] what this has done in the minds of a lot
[56:45] of people a lot of baby boomers maybe
[56:47] Trump supporters whatever is like this
[56:49] probability distribution like the left
[56:51] tail outcome of like zero like wipe that
[56:55] off cut it off you know and then how do
[56:57] you value Bitcoin if it well it could be
[56:59] $0 per coin or it could be 10 million
[57:01] but we don't know how do you value that
[57:03] if the left tail is off is cut off right
[57:06] and so like for me or you the left tail
[57:08] argument of oh Bitcoin goes to zero
[57:11] wasn't hasn't been a something that we
[57:13] realistically thought about for ever you
[57:16] know it just it's like oh yeah it's a
[57:17] dumb argument but for a lot of people
[57:19] that was like in whether they understood
[57:20] it or not that was their thinking and so
[57:22] when you see Bitcoin you know being this
[57:24] mainstream maybe looking to 28 it's
[57:27] going to be bipartisan consensus
[57:29] governments aren Banning it it's not
[57:31] going to zero what does that mean um and
[57:34] so that's I think that's really the the
[57:36] thing that I've been excited about is
[57:38] like Trump wins kamla wins like you know
[57:41] there's a lot of other issues outside of
[57:43] Bitcoin or crypto that I think I I even
[57:46] think about more um but I think you know
[57:49] Trump would be good but either way I
[57:52] doesn't you know a Harris Administration
[57:54] doesn't stop Bitcoin from reaching 6
[57:56] figes plus yeah I think that's a that's
[57:59] uh important uh message here um really
[58:02] cool then let's come to the end routine
[58:03] I have one question that is always the
[58:05] same for every guest and then one
[58:06] question from the previous guest the
[58:08] first question that is always the same
[58:10] what can we learn from you besides
[58:12] Bitcoin wow that's a that's a great
[58:15] question
[58:17] um um I would just say that um you know
[58:21] one of the things that I've um you know
[58:24] in in the past four years but really
[58:26] like my my um my my life is I've I've
[58:30] always uh had a hunger and curiosity of
[58:33] to learn um you know part of the reason
[58:35] I dropped out of school was because I
[58:38] was you know I was always learning like
[58:40] scrolling my phone online reading books
[58:44] um and and there wasn't it was I think
[58:45] it was sort of a naive belief but there
[58:47] was this kind of belief that like I
[58:49] could I can learn whatever you know it
[58:51] like I don't care what my business
[58:52] school teaches me or or you know my
[58:54] teacher says or doesn't
[58:56] like I can go I can go figure out
[58:59] anything um and so that I think again
[59:02] it's sort of the naive young belief but
[59:04] I think there especially in information
[59:06] World um I think that um I wouldn't put
[59:09] a limit on what you can do or what you
[59:11] can learn um especially in this you know
[59:14] current current age right whether you
[59:16] want to be a uh you know computer
[59:19] science computer scientist or a coder or
[59:21] whether you want to be a writer or
[59:23] whatever like you have you have all of
[59:25] the tools out there you know if you want
[59:27] to start a podcast do it if you wanna if
[59:30] you want to like do whatever do it right
[59:32] and you you don't need validation and
[59:34] also you know at at first you don't need
[59:36] anybody to say you can or can't do it
[59:38] and also like you know basically all the
[59:40] tools and resources for you to learn or
[59:43] do anything are basically out there
[59:45] already you know there's not really any
[59:47] walled Gardens anymore of like in terms
[59:49] of information or in terms of just like
[59:52] the tools required to basically to to do
[59:55] or or learn whatever you want um and so
[59:58] and that I think that's some to a
[60:00] certain extent has always been the case
[60:01] right it's just like you know just just
[60:03] shoot high and see what you can do but
[60:04] now especially in like this information
[60:06] age you can quite literally almost learn
[60:08] anything you know it's like all
[60:10] information's abundant and everywhere
[60:13] and so you know for me that's that's
[60:15] sort of been something that was
[60:16] instilled upon me early on but it's also
[60:18] the past four or five years um you know
[60:21] I couldn't have I couldn't have imagined
[60:23] what I'd be doing you know and if for
[60:26] today in 2020 but it was just and there
[60:29] wasn't even an end goal in mind right it
[60:30] was just like you know it was just a
[60:32] hunger for like I don't know I don't
[60:34] know what that is let me look it up like
[60:35] I I'm going to go read this I'm oh this
[60:37] person is really smart I want to listen
[60:38] to them um and so you know that's
[60:41] something I always I think about is that
[60:42] like it's there's always this there's
[60:45] there's this reach for wanting something
[60:47] to to have it now or to know it now or
[60:49] to like have it all figured out and the
[60:51] reality is like everybody's kind of
[60:52] making it up on the Fly and so you know
[60:55] it's just kind of just if you can just
[60:56] be 1% better every day I know that's
[60:58] cliche um but if you can just learn one
[61:00] new thing or you know just you know do
[61:04] do something you didn't do yesterday
[61:05] read that next chapter like that those
[61:07] compounding gains over a long time um
[61:10] really add up so for me you know some
[61:12] someone that just loves to learn um it's
[61:14] been uh that mindset and that uh that
[61:17] reality has been you know has has
[61:19] changed my life in many way so I think
[61:20] that outside of Bitcoin and maybe I'm
[61:22] applying it to like the the journey I've
[61:24] had in the Bitcoin space but um you know
[61:29] that that just Daily Progress that daily
[61:31] hunger and drive on a on a you know six
[61:34] month one year four year time frame like
[61:37] you can't imagine where where you'll be
[61:38] you know you couldn't have imagined
[61:40] being 280 podcast episodes in after your
[61:43] first one right and you know having
[61:45] having on like the biggest name in
[61:47] Bitcoin with Michael sailor and getting
[61:49] 100,000 views like you know when you
[61:52] were first thinking of your
[61:53] podcast you couldn't have even imagin
[61:55] that right but it was like it was just
[61:57] that daily showing up editing like you
[62:00] know when no when no one was watching
[62:01] the podcast but you were showing up
[62:04] right so I think that's that's a kind of
[62:05] a uh something that is supersedes
[62:10] Bitcoin or supersedes you know what
[62:11] we're doing right now and it's just more
[62:13] of like a like a good attitude to have
[62:16] for Life absolutely I 100% agree as as
[62:20] the podcast also uh shows for me I just
[62:23] basically started it like not even 11
[62:25] months ago uh and was on on the stage on
[62:29] in Amsterdam I loved it so much really
[62:31] cool um the last question uh is from
[62:34] previous guest so like the previous
[62:35] guest is asking a question for the next
[62:36] guest without knowing who the next guest
[62:38] actually is uh and he asked you if not
[62:41] Bitcoin what would you invest your money
[62:44] in yeah I would I mean it probably be a
[62:47] mix of like I would say you know gold as
[62:50] crazy as it is um as well as just like
[62:54] uh Tech um
[62:56] you know I I uh I funny enough I bought
[62:59] I bought a 1 o gold coin in covid um I
[63:01] was I was I was all all in Bitcoin
[63:03] almost but I was like you know sound
[63:05] money hard money I'll I'll pay some
[63:06] homage to it and I bought a gold coin I
[63:08] sold it like six months later for Less
[63:10] Bitcoin I was like oh gosh um but it was
[63:13] that and now yeah I'd probably be a you
[63:14] know I'm really interested in Tech and
[63:17] all the AI stuff and um so yeah I think
[63:20] it' be that but um you know for now my
[63:23] investing framework's pretty pretty
[63:25] boring pretty simple um just stack as
[63:27] much Bitcoin and maybe some Bitcoin
[63:29] proxies as possible really really cool
