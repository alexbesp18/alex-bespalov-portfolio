[00:00] that's why people call it the Fiat Ponzi
[00:02] because it's just built on paper
[00:03] Promises at this point that will never
[00:05] be paid back and they're putting this
[00:07] really extreme downward pressure on
[00:09] society to outpace this rate of
[00:12] inflation and no one can right I mean
[00:14] you can't go to your boss and say hey
[00:16] groceries are up 20% so I need a 25%
[00:18] raise people at the top who get to
[00:20] manipulate the cost of capital and
[00:22] interest rates and the people closest to
[00:24] them benefit at the expense of everyone
[00:25] else and then they say oh it's the
[00:27] greedy corporations it's messed up it's
[00:29] like we're flying in a plane that has no
[00:31] altimeter we're navigating the Seas
[00:33] without a North star what I think is
[00:34] great about Bitcoin is whether you are
[00:37] absolutely poor living paycheck to
[00:38] paycheck or at the wealthiest possible
[00:41] position it benefits
[00:43] you the first time I heard about you was
[00:45] I think on the what Bitcoin did podcast
[00:48] and uh I heard then your story about the
[00:52] American dream living the upbringing
[00:54] with your parents and I I really love
[00:56] that story and uh the question I asked
[00:59] myself when I listen to that was um how
[01:02] did this all your upbringing uh what you
[01:05] learned from your parents influence then
[01:08] your thinking of Bitcoin and what you're
[01:10] doing
[01:11] now sure I mean I'm I'm so grateful to
[01:15] have had two parents who were willing to
[01:17] sacrifice so much just to give their
[01:19] kids a better life and that was what the
[01:21] American dream represented for them so
[01:23] by the time they came um I remember
[01:25] there was a lot of trepidation my mom
[01:27] was 38 my dad was 41 and they just were
[01:29] nervous nous you know they didn't know
[01:30] the language they didn't know what would
[01:32] happen but they just had this hope they
[01:34] had this hope that outweighed all of the
[01:37] the worries and the anxiety and they
[01:39] wanted to create a a foundation for
[01:42] their kids to live a better life than
[01:44] they did they grew up under communism
[01:46] and so for me I always it's self-imposed
[01:49] I always put a lot of pressure on myself
[01:51] to just work really hard and succeed um
[01:54] so that I can justify their sacrifices I
[01:56] was someone who always I just want to
[01:58] help my parents and make them proud
[02:00] and when I saw them go through all the
[02:03] financial obstacles they did especially
[02:06] after the great financial crisis it made
[02:08] me it lit a fire under me it planted a
[02:11] seed where I wanted to understand how
[02:12] this could happen to hardworking good
[02:15] people who play by the rules and pay all
[02:17] their taxes but I also it it motivated
[02:20] me to help make a difference and be part
[02:23] of a change and hold people accountable
[02:25] and so again I'm kind of I'm really
[02:28] grateful because my childhood was not
[02:30] easy and I didn't have Financial
[02:32] Security and um I had no guarantees of
[02:35] what was going to happen with any path
[02:36] that I took but I had this great
[02:38] motivation and two parents who told me
[02:40] that if you work hard you can achieve
[02:42] anything you want and that is again the
[02:44] American dream and so finding Bitcoin
[02:47] for me was this very full circle moment
[02:49] because I finally
[02:51] realized what was broken in the system
[02:54] and how and why and I connected the dots
[02:57] and there was this amazing solution as
[02:59] well that if if we embrace it we can fix
[03:01] so many of the problems in society and
[03:03] it won't be overnight it won't be easy
[03:05] there will be obstacles but we can Usher
[03:07] in more flourishing and prosperity than
[03:09] we've ever known yeah and you even went
[03:12] ahead and and quit your usual job to go
[03:15] fulltime on bitcoin and I actually quite
[03:18] myself I'm right now in the process of
[03:20] doing that I'm working with 21 Bitcoin a
[03:22] sponsor in Austria and and stuff like
[03:24] that so I know till now this was my
[03:26] hardest decision ever I worked six years
[03:29] in in a really good paying job a loving
[03:31] Community even there and it was just a
[03:35] topic that did not interest interested
[03:36] me those it security and not Bitcoin so
[03:40] I go went ahead and did that and I know
[03:43] how hard this is of a decision and you
[03:45] also did that um what was your situation
[03:48] when you did that did you had like an
[03:50] Financial um savings where you're like
[03:53] oh I can land on something or like
[03:54] completely let's jump into it well I've
[03:58] always been a really good saver because
[03:59] background and um I've always been a big
[04:02] risk taker I just think if you don't
[04:03] take a chance you'll never know and I
[04:05] would hate to look back and wonder what
[04:07] if rather than to do something and then
[04:09] fail and ultimately learn from it so I I
[04:12] saw this great opportunity and I felt
[04:14] like I had the right training and
[04:15] preparation for it with my media skills
[04:17] I felt like I could really help with
[04:19] education and getting the message out
[04:21] and so I just thought well I'll take a
[04:23] chance and I will live off of savings
[04:25] for a year and if it doesn't work out I
[04:27] can always try to get another job and
[04:29] maybe I'll have to take a step back but
[04:31] I can always go back to that I know that
[04:33] industry I know I have the skills for it
[04:35] so um why not why not see what I can
[04:38] build and really take a chance on myself
[04:40] and I sort of stumbled into the whole
[04:42] thing because I loved podcasting I
[04:45] listen to a lot of podcasts because they
[04:47] were really interesting long form
[04:50] interviews and you got to hear all the
[04:52] different layers of a story or of an
[04:54] individual's life and you got more
[04:57] context than you would if you watch
[04:59] watched say a short story on on TV news
[05:02] which was the kind of Storytelling I was
[05:04] doing I would work a whole day or
[05:06] sometimes weeks or months on end to put
[05:09] together a 90 second or two minute story
[05:12] and I I prefer a long form interview
[05:15] where you just kind of get to know
[05:16] someone or a topic a little bit more so
[05:19] I I started to do the podcast as just a
[05:21] hobby and then about a year in I decided
[05:24] to take a chance and go off on my own
[05:28] that's amazing what like uh I feel like
[05:31] especially the younger people don't
[05:33] watch normal TV I don't know how it's in
[05:35] America and in Austria see the younger
[05:38] people don't watch the normal T TV it's
[05:40] also sponsored by the state I don't know
[05:42] this is America the whole thing well
[05:45] supposed to be independent but I I mean
[05:48] how can you be independent if you get
[05:49] tax money from someone right right but
[05:53] uh it's like how how do you see the
[05:56] whole uh thing going when there's
[05:58] traditional TV where there's still a lot
[06:01] going on but I feel like it's the older
[06:02] generation older generation of course
[06:04] they older they they die out at some
[06:06] point or is it just like an age thing uh
[06:09] and then how is YouTube now playing out
[06:11] I also saw something interesting there
[06:13] was like comparison between TV shows and
[06:15] YouTube shows and there are a lot of
[06:17] YouTube shows that now have an higher
[06:19] cost of production per minute than most
[06:22] of the TV shows so like when you look at
[06:24] Mr Beast and something like that how do
[06:26] you see this whole media scene playing
[06:28] out oh my gosh it's crazy to see how
[06:32] much the media industry and news has
[06:34] evolved since I was a little kid
[06:36] dreaming of becoming a newscaster uh my
[06:39] family immigrated when I was five and we
[06:41] watched a lot of American news programs
[06:44] because it helped my parents learn
[06:45] English so I grew up on all the big
[06:48] newscasters of that time Diane Sawyers
[06:51] Barbara Walters Oprah Winfrey and I
[06:54] thought what an amazing career they get
[06:56] to interview people important people be
[06:58] on the front lines of History they got
[07:00] to get paid to learn essentially and
[07:03] travel to incredible places and I just
[07:05] thought it was a very Noble profession
[07:07] especially if you do investigative
[07:09] journalism and you hold people
[07:10] accountable and you follow public
[07:12] records and you make sure that you know
[07:14] things are are done in a way that isn't
[07:16] corrupt uh but by the time I entered
[07:18] into the industry the technology was all
[07:21] already Shifting the business model um
[07:24] internet was making it so that the
[07:26] revenue streams were starting to
[07:28] Splinter off in independent content
[07:30] creators were slowly starting to emerge
[07:33] but even the technology made it so that
[07:35] a reporter was now doing the job of like
[07:38] five people they would be the producer
[07:40] and the editor and sometimes you were
[07:42] shoot I went from shooting on this
[07:43] massive massive camera all by myself to
[07:46] all of a sudden in my last job I would
[07:47] shoot some stories on my iPhone which is
[07:50] crazy um and meanwhile the pay wasn't
[07:53] keeping up with the cost of living when
[07:55] um when I was young a local news
[07:58] reporter could make a really good living
[08:01] afford a nice house and by the time I I
[08:03] was working in the industry you were
[08:05] getting paid I mean a fifth of the
[08:07] salary that you needed in order to
[08:09] afford a nice life so I saw a drastic
[08:13] shift happen and you're right young
[08:16] people especially as the internet came
[08:18] out why would they sit down at 5:30 to
[08:20] watch a 30 minute newscast that was
[08:22] probably already out of date because
[08:24] everything online is so immediate and
[08:27] 247 and that was an interesting shift as
[08:30] well my favorite news Market that I
[08:32] worked in was actually my first one it
[08:34] was in a town called Palm Springs
[08:36] California and it's a retirement it's
[08:39] very known for being a retirement
[08:41] community so my audience was generally
[08:44] like 70s 80s and up and they actually
[08:47] watched the news and so I felt like my
[08:49] work mattered because I would go to a
[08:51] grocery store and people would say oh I
[08:53] saw your story you know but as I as I
[08:56] got to bigger cities um no one would no
[08:59] one would say that to me cuz none of
[09:00] them watched the news they had no idea
[09:02] what I was doing which was It was kind
[09:04] of sad you know because you want your
[09:05] work to make an impact and what are you
[09:07] doing the story for if nobody's going to
[09:09] watch it uh so it was interesting to see
[09:11] how people were shifting from the
[09:13] television the Legacy era of that to
[09:16] consuming everything here and
[09:18] everything's immediate and you have
[09:19] citizen journalists and I think the way
[09:22] I'll wrap up this uh tangent is it was
[09:25] also sad to see more and more
[09:28] politicization
[09:30] everything was turning into left and
[09:32] right and I felt like some of the
[09:35] networks were more biased toward certain
[09:38] political agencies or government just
[09:41] government agencies in general instead
[09:43] of questioning it it was just always
[09:45] presented as fact and no one could kind
[09:48] of question it and and that bothered me
[09:50] at my core because my background my
[09:52] parents again they grew up under
[09:54] communism they were always very
[09:55] skeptical of what they were being told
[09:57] by the government or by the media and so
[09:59] it didn't sit well with me I really
[10:01] again I wanted to question more things
[10:03] hold them accountable I wasn't able to
[10:05] always cover the stories the way I
[10:06] wanted to so I'm very grateful that
[10:09] decentralized media and decentralized
[10:11] money allowed me to have this career
[10:13] instead yeah I mean we see it with so
[10:16] many examples like the taker Carlson
[10:19] went from Fox to now independent and now
[10:22] it seems like he everybody knows him
[10:24] before it was like a smaller group and
[10:26] especially more in America I feel like
[10:29] Europe where based is like now everybody
[10:32] knows Tako Carlson and speaks about them
[10:35] about him it's it's interesting but also
[10:37] politics I speak with a lot of
[10:40] bitcoiners about how Bitcoin can change
[10:43] uh politics and the society level and
[10:47] this is one question I still have not
[10:49] figured out for myself um how can
[10:52] Bitcoin uh like I see a lot of extremist
[10:56] going on a lot of um not going good on
[11:00] the politics side a lot of frustrations
[11:02] uh in in people and how can PE Bitcoin
[11:06] be positive change in politics or can it
[11:09] be because in the end of the day it's
[11:11] just money I love that Bitcoin is
[11:14] apolitical and people on the left and
[11:17] the right they can embrace it and the
[11:19] and the principles fall in line with
[11:21] what both sides are are really
[11:22] passionate about and advocating for It
[11:25] ultimately is about empowering the
[11:26] individual and I think that a lot of
[11:28] people today are turning to politics and
[11:31] getting distracted by social issues that
[11:34] that aren't really about the core of
[11:36] what's wrong um because they just they
[11:39] don't have the education about how our
[11:41] financial system works they have a
[11:43] skewed version in their minds of what
[11:45] capitalism is I mean capitalism is about
[11:49] saving it's about the free market
[11:51] allocating resources and and everyone
[11:54] having an equal opportunity to create
[11:56] value it's not about some people at the
[11:58] top who get to manipulate at the cost of
[12:00] capital and interest rates and the
[12:02] people closest to them benefit at the
[12:03] expense of everyone else and then they
[12:05] say oh it's the greedy corporations
[12:07] right it's like it's messed up it's like
[12:09] we're flying in a plane that has no
[12:11] altimeter we're navigating the Seas
[12:13] without a North star and and I'm so
[12:16] grateful that we've come to a place
[12:18] where we do have something like Bitcoin
[12:20] because before I would have I would have
[12:23] looked to the Future and I I was for a
[12:25] while thinking nothing's going to fix
[12:28] this it's just only going to get worse
[12:30] and I'm I'm I'm worried about the next
[12:32] couple of decades and what my children
[12:34] the kind of world they will live in um
[12:36] and now I look at it with hope that we
[12:38] have a tool that will help solve these
[12:40] problems and it won't be easy or happen
[12:42] overnight right we're going to have a
[12:44] ton of push back and obstacles and we
[12:46] have to educate a lot of people but we
[12:48] have a tool of Hope and empowerment and
[12:51] if we and if we didn't I I mean I I
[12:53] don't know maybe I'd be a big gold bug
[12:55] thinking we got to go back on the gold
[12:57] standard that's interesting and and I
[13:00] got a interesting question from a guest
[13:02] uh like two or three episodes ago um how
[13:05] can Bitcoin change people's life and he
[13:09] especially asked for someone that is
[13:12] maybe living paycheck to paycheck has
[13:14] already two jobs and it's like how can I
[13:17] I cannot even save any money I cannot uh
[13:21] like I cannot even dream of paying for
[13:24] an Hardware wallet or something like
[13:25] that uh how can Bitcoin help like
[13:28] especially those kind of people and I
[13:30] think we for that question probably we
[13:33] have to get on a broader scale and a
[13:35] little bit of a longer time Horizon
[13:37] because it's not immediately but how can
[13:39] people Bitcoin change uh the lives of
[13:42] those kind of people in a positive way
[13:45] what I think is great about Bitcoin is
[13:47] whether you
[13:47] are absolutely poor living paycheck to
[13:50] paycheck or or at the wealthiest you
[13:53] know possible
[13:55] position it benefits you and I know that
[13:58] it's so hard for people who are just
[14:00] barely treading water with the cost of
[14:03] living but there is something that you
[14:05] could probably start to reallocate right
[14:09] I mean instead of spending money on even
[14:11] if it's a a a meal or a coffee I mean
[14:13] everyone spends money that maybe they
[14:15] could have they could have allocated it
[14:17] in a different way being able to put it
[14:20] into this piece of technology and an
[14:22] asset that has outperformed everything
[14:25] else that actually allows you to be able
[14:26] to save I look at Bitcoin not as an
[14:28] investment
[14:29] not as something that carries all this
[14:31] risk and you're just sort of gambling
[14:33] and speculating and waiting to sell it
[14:34] and pass it off to something else I see
[14:37] it as truly returning us to sound money
[14:40] and the ability to save again I see it
[14:42] as a savings technology and whether you
[14:43] make a little or a lot everybody needs
[14:46] to save and the alternative system that
[14:49] we've been living in has just been this
[14:51] house of cards built completely on debt
[14:53] and we need ever expanding credit to
[14:56] create less and less real productivity
[14:58] and real value and so our whole system
[15:00] that's why people call it the Fiat Ponzi
[15:03] because it's just built on paper
[15:05] Promises at this point that will never
[15:07] be paid back and they're putting this
[15:09] really extreme downward pressure on
[15:12] society to outpace this rate of
[15:15] inflation and no one can right I mean
[15:18] you can't go to your boss and say hey
[15:20] groceries are up 20% so I need a 25%
[15:23] raise and so it's starting to get to
[15:25] that point where I think the average
[15:26] person is feeling it more and more um in
[15:29] the United States I think people were so
[15:31] lucky for so long because being the
[15:32] global Reserve currency and really the
[15:34] closest to the money printer it created
[15:37] a lot of immediate and and longlasting I
[15:40] mean decades long wealth the middle
[15:43] class was booming for a very long time
[15:46] and now it's sort of collapsing because
[15:48] the system at its core is unsustainable
[15:50] it doesn't create real value and growth
[15:52] in productivity it exports a lot of the
[15:56] inflation to other nations um but now
[15:59] it's kind of like hollowed out at its
[16:00] core and and so from here to developing
[16:04] nations everyone is the average worker
[16:07] is suffering and unable to keep up with
[16:09] the pace of everything getting more
[16:11] expensive and this is what Jeff Booth
[16:13] talks about right it's like productivity
[16:16] technology it's supposed to drive prices
[16:18] down you're supposed to be able to
[16:20] afford more maybe work less and we're
[16:22] not seeing that it's not the reality and
[16:25] we've turned houses into uh savings
[16:27] accounts there are so far overvalued to
[16:31] what they're actually worth there are
[16:33] Shacks in certain parts of America that
[16:35] are worth millions of dollars you have
[16:37] to renovate the whole thing it's about
[16:39] to you know fall over on itself and it's
[16:41] worth you know $2 million because maybe
[16:43] it sits near a beach that's insane I
[16:47] that's that's not that's not an
[16:49] indicator of a healthy economy and
[16:52] spending when you don't have the money
[16:55] that's not an indicator of a healthy
[16:57] economy so we need something that
[16:58] address is that and again I know it's
[17:01] hard for people who don't have a lot of
[17:02] money but even putting a little bit the
[17:04] fact that you can buy $1 one Euro one
[17:07] yen one Rubble of Bitcoin that will
[17:10] start to make a difference it will
[17:12] otherwise you're just treading water
[17:14] with money that's consistently worth
[17:15] less I'm super excited to announce that
[17:18] this podcast got the first ever sponsor
[17:22] 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one
[17:26] and they teach and preach self custom
[17:29] this is my goto exchange when someone
[17:32] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[17:34] from this is the easiest entry for
[17:37] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[17:40] Plus at the same time support this
[17:42] podcast use code Robin and click the
[17:44] link in the description yeah it's
[17:46] amazing and for me always the question
[17:48] comes up there's so much more pain
[17:51] coming and even now there's so much more
[17:53] pain in all the systems and in the same
[17:56] time there's such great Bitcoin
[17:58] Educators just like yourself in the
[18:02] system and I'm like then I go out in the
[18:06] normal land if I can tell it say it like
[18:08] that now um why do so many people
[18:11] struggle to still get Bitcoin like small
[18:15] story I have I as my I quit my job and I
[18:18] said like I'm doing this Bitcoin podcast
[18:20] thing now people had in mind oh I'm this
[18:22] scrypto guy like it's like this
[18:25] completely weird thing of of Bitcoin and
[18:28] it seems like like with everyone I talk
[18:30] that is not in the Bitcoin world has a
[18:33] completely um offset uh view of Bitcoin
[18:37] like how why are we still why are we
[18:40] still so
[18:41] early I mean that's a great question
[18:43] we're all working on trying to help
[18:45] onboard so many people but there is so
[18:47] much resistance and I think at the core
[18:49] of that is people just really don't
[18:50] understand how the financial system
[18:52] works uh and I was one of them they
[18:54] don't understand the plumbing they don't
[18:55] understand how how governments print
[18:57] money they don't understand the history
[18:59] of money and how it evolved before
[19:01] Bitcoin I didn't know what the f
[19:04] happened in 1971 right I didn't
[19:07] understand all of this I was really
[19:08] little um so I think we need to increase
[19:11] financial literacy everywhere I think
[19:14] one of the reasons why we see Bitcoin
[19:16] hitting all-time high prices in a lot of
[19:18] different nations especially in the
[19:19] developing world is because there's a
[19:22] pain Point there's like a reality and a
[19:24] problem that it solves immediately today
[19:26] whereas sometimes in the west we're kind
[19:28] of kind of coddled into a false sense of
[19:31] safety and this 40 60 portfolio in
[19:34] America has been safe and it's performed
[19:37] well and so people don't really question
[19:39] it and I think we've we've sort of um
[19:42] diverged from at least here in the
[19:44] United States like I I always admired
[19:46] our founding fathers because I just
[19:47] thought that they were really courageous
[19:50] and smart and they they created the
[19:53] foundation for what was the most
[19:55] empowering flourishing government that
[19:57] we've had I mean all of it's kind of an
[19:59] experiment right but I think that their
[20:01] what they set up was the best possible
[20:03] way to to sort of De decentralize the
[20:06] power and have checks and balances and
[20:08] like in an imperfect world it was the
[20:10] best version of government that that was
[20:12] being attempted but now here we are with
[20:15] the central bank and the purchasing
[20:17] power of the dollar getting demolished
[20:20] the wealth Gap growing the average
[20:22] person not feeling like they can make it
[20:24] and so we need to re-evaluate some of
[20:26] these things and return to a sense of
[20:28] that spirit of individuality and that
[20:31] rugged you know passion about freedom
[20:34] and creating your own destiny as opposed
[20:36] to just looking to the government for
[20:37] all your Solutions oh well please send
[20:40] me you know my helicopter money and
[20:42] provide me with my basic income just for
[20:44] existing it's like where is the drive
[20:47] and the motivation to create your own
[20:50] future and be productive and create
[20:52] value I think that's what's sad is so
[20:55] many people just are lulled into this
[20:57] convenience and comfort of well you know
[21:00] I just I expect to get a payment every
[21:01] month and no like we're owed nothing and
[21:05] I think the most beautiful things are
[21:07] created from just raw raw resources that
[21:10] we put to use through creativity and
[21:12] Entrepreneurship and we don't have a lot
[21:14] of that we don't have the opportunity
[21:16] for that we don't have free markets Mass
[21:17] corporations make it difficult for small
[21:19] business owners to compete and try to
[21:21] innovate and create new things um so it
[21:23] really skews everything in in in the
[21:26] economy uh Preston pish talks about this
[21:28] a lot right the lack of biodiversity we
[21:30] just have concentrated capital and
[21:33] concentrated power so much that
[21:35] everything's just a mass Corporation
[21:37] Mass food Mass this and and that doesn't
[21:40] that doesn't showcase the vibrant
[21:42] diversity of us as human beings and what
[21:44] what we could potentially create and how
[21:46] we could interact with one another um
[21:48] especially economically so I see a lot
[21:51] of Hope with um with Bitcoin maybe
[21:53] changing that and and maybe I'm overly
[21:55] optimistic but we need that I mean I
[21:57] like imine the world on a Bitcoin
[21:59] standard and I smile because I'm like we
[22:02] could create the most beautiful things
[22:04] and yeah maybe it'll be harder in some
[22:06] ways you're not going to get a paycheck
[22:07] from the government every month but
[22:08] it'll be so much more worth it you're
[22:10] not going to be like a zoo animal with
[22:12] your water and three meals every day in
[22:14] your cage for safety you're going to be
[22:16] out in the wild like creating your own
[22:19] destiny and I think that's amazing and
[22:22] it's uh wow that's really really cool
[22:24] and and beautifully said and I think
[22:26] this all what you said like it it it
[22:29] fills in this everything bubble like the
[22:31] housing bubble everything is getting
[22:34] getting just propped up and it's like oh
[22:36] yes I have my houses and and then like
[22:39] 10 years oh it's 20x more worth like why
[22:43] is it 20x more worth nobody is in
[22:45] questioning that yeah of course my house
[22:47] that needs renovation is way shittier
[22:50] than than 20 years ago now is PX wor
[22:53] more like that's that's crazy how do you
[22:55] see like the the economy going from like
[22:58] maybe the economy in the the near term
[23:01] like the next year going and maybe in
[23:03] the in the long term like 10 10 20 years
[23:07] um do you see that Bubble Burst somehow
[23:09] or how long can we track this
[23:12] out well I mean certainly it's
[23:14] unsustainable and we have this cycle of
[23:16] booms and busts and each one is more um
[23:18] intense and dramatic than the last but
[23:20] how many times can you do it and bail
[23:22] out the system right and paper over it
[23:24] until you're totally just ju uh like I
[23:27] mean you have a hollowed out economy and
[23:30] no one's going to trust your currency
[23:31] anymore which I think is what's starting
[23:32] to happen globally as people start to
[23:35] move away from the dollar and it'll take
[23:36] a long time but I do feel like we're on
[23:38] the brink we're in this the middle of
[23:40] this Paradigm Shift where things are
[23:42] changing Jeff Booth says it's going to
[23:44] reice asset classes like real estate I
[23:46] mean I can't even I can't imagine a
[23:48] world where prices are getting less
[23:49] expensive and I think everyone is
[23:51] terrified of that right but it is crazy
[23:54] that all of this money I mean when it's
[23:56] printed it has to flow somewhere and
[23:57] over the last few decades it has caused
[24:00] just exponential asset inflation and and
[24:03] there it's completely decoupled from
[24:05] reality again a a shack that's breaking
[24:08] down and and barely able to stand is is
[24:11] worth a ridiculous amount of money on
[24:13] the real estate side and then look at
[24:15] the stocks I mean price to earnings is
[24:19] just insane and these companies are so
[24:21] decoupled from their fundamentals and
[24:23] the products and services are just
[24:25] getting worse and worse I mean has
[24:26] anyone flown any commercial airline
[24:29] lately it's like I mean they they go go
[24:32] into debt they buy back shares
[24:34] everything is about the share price uh
[24:36] Grant Williams was just on my show and
[24:37] he said something I thought was so
[24:39] brilliant we don't even approach stocks
[24:42] as owners anymore like the point of
[24:44] having stock is to own you're you're an
[24:46] owner in the company you want it you
[24:48] want it to succeed you're invested in
[24:50] what their products are and their
[24:51] management no we're renting stocks we
[24:54] just want the price to go up we want to
[24:56] we ready to pass it off to the next one
[24:58] if one starts to you know halt or go
[25:00] down we don't care we don't care about
[25:03] being owners and when you own something
[25:04] you take care of it right when you rent
[25:06] you're kind of like well this isn't mine
[25:08] and we so we need to change that and I
[25:09] think that Bitcoin will cause a lot of
[25:11] that to change but that means that
[25:13] there's going to be a lot of chaos and
[25:16] it's going to be good it's going to be
[25:18] bad I I mean I'm I thank goodness we
[25:20] have this life ref and we can peacefully
[25:22] opt into it because I I hope that it is
[25:25] not this seismic shift and deflationary
[25:28] but bust that ushers in you know Great
[25:30] Depression two 2.0 and everyone's
[25:32] calling for the distri redistribution of
[25:34] wealth and 75% taxes on those greedy
[25:37] bitcoiners or something I I hope that
[25:39] it's a more peaceful
[25:41] transition but who knows I mean the next
[25:44] couple of years I think will be crazy
[25:45] it'll be more political more polarizing
[25:47] and that's one of the reasons why I
[25:49] think we have to get the message out to
[25:50] more people because when you learn about
[25:52] Bitcoin you can't help but feel more
[25:54] hope you don't fall for all the
[25:56] political nonsense and you start to
[25:58] think about what you can do to
[25:59] contribute and build and you feel more
[26:02] safe and comfortable about the future
[26:03] like you don't have to panic so much um
[26:06] so you know we're going to build a
[26:08] better world but it'll it'll be a a wild
[26:10] ride to get
[26:12] there definitely and it's also the the
[26:14] timing will be interesting how long can
[26:18] it take till we get there and I think
[26:20] education is like so key to to all of
[26:23] that and you posted I don't know when it
[26:26] was but I saw it on on Twitter where
[26:28] posted your YouTube statistics how many
[26:30] females and males there there were and I
[26:33] think it was 20% or something like that
[26:36] you
[26:37] you and it was interesting because mine
[26:40] is like five or four or something like
[26:42] that really really really low um so
[26:45] first of all like why do you think there
[26:47] are so many more men than women in the
[26:51] Bitcoin space and how can we change
[26:55] that yeah I mean it's one of my missions
[26:57] I really want to make this more
[26:59] approachable um to women and I want them
[27:01] to be passionate about it I think a lot
[27:03] of I mean my girlfriends they don't like
[27:04] to talk about money they like to they
[27:07] like to buy experiences and all that and
[27:09] and a lot of them are stressed about
[27:10] making enough but they don't like to
[27:12] talk about like the money or the
[27:14] plumbing I also think in general and
[27:16] this is this is kind of generalizing but
[27:19] I think that men are more interested in
[27:22] things like math technology engineering
[27:26] Finance because they're attracted to um
[27:30] like tools and solving problems whereas
[27:33] women are a lot of the times more
[27:35] attracted to careers that deal with
[27:36] people right I mean Nursing
[27:40] education public Rel I mean again
[27:42] generalizing a little bit but I I think
[27:45] one of the most beautiful attributes
[27:47] that women have is this this
[27:49] nurturing inner Instinct that allows us
[27:52] to form Community very easily we we like
[27:55] a sense of community we we think about
[27:58] you know how people are feeling and if
[28:00] they feel welcome and and so we need to
[28:03] introduce more of that I think we need
[28:05] to create more of that feminine energy
[28:07] within the Bitcoin space so that it does
[28:09] feel more like a community and and
[28:11] what's funny is girls sometimes get the
[28:13] get the bad reputation of oh they're
[28:16] caddy and whatever they they fight with
[28:18] each other I'm sorry but all the women
[28:20] on bitcoin Twitter are like peaceful and
[28:22] happy and and very positive and all the
[28:25] guys are constantly going at each other
[28:27] and fighting um so I think I just think
[28:29] we need a little bit of that female
[28:31] touch the warmth and and not everything
[28:34] has to be so so so Technical and rigid
[28:37] um but I think it's just going to take
[28:39] more women so that people can see
[28:41] themselves represented and then they
[28:42] feel invited like I love to learn and
[28:44] network with and from other women so um
[28:48] I think that the more that we see women
[28:50] getting involved the more women they
[28:52] will bring in and and I think it's all a
[28:54] creative I mean bitcoin's not just for
[28:56] women it's not just for men it's not for
[28:57] old it's not for it's for everyone and I
[29:00] think that that's the big core um
[29:01] takeaway but women especially need to be
[29:04] more financially empowered I know a lot
[29:05] of them are worrying about their Futures
[29:07] and their children and my friends are
[29:09] certainly worried about how they're
[29:10] going to make ends meet and I sometimes
[29:13] wonder I'm like well I'm I'm offering
[29:14] you this tool why are you not you know
[29:17] drinking the water I'm leading you to it
[29:19] but everyone has their own I guess their
[29:21] own journey and and and what makes them
[29:23] actually go down the rabbit hole I mean
[29:26] in my own personal experience and this
[29:28] is like an really small personal
[29:30] experience it it's like for me when I
[29:32] tell some friend uh some male Friend of
[29:35] of of Bitcoin they usually tend to be
[29:37] really uh fast with jumping
[29:40] in they sometimes like yeah let's let's
[29:43] try it out they they like okay where can
[29:45] I buy it send me some link and women are
[29:48] more cautious maybe just my personal
[29:51] experience but I don't know if you also
[29:53] see that kind of behavior that they're
[29:55] more cautious more conservative about
[29:57] those stuff though oh absolutely and and
[30:00] a lot of women do see the space as sort
[30:01] of gambling and very speculative and if
[30:03] you go to a casino I mean there I feel
[30:06] like I've always seen more men at
[30:08] casinos than than women um and when you
[30:11] look at anything in this space right
[30:13] Bitcoin is this really
[30:15] interesting combination and intersection
[30:17] of so many different Industries and um
[30:21] studies and and levels of expertise I
[30:24] mean in terms of just bringing together
[30:25] finance and computer science and techn
[30:27] technology and physics and all that and
[30:30] again a lot of those Industries are
[30:32] dominated by men um so I I really hope
[30:36] that
[30:37] women get excited to learn about how to
[30:41] how to empower themselves financially
[30:43] for the future so that they can plan and
[30:44] take care of their families and and be
[30:46] able to do take chances on some of the
[30:48] things that they want to create um and
[30:51] it's funny because I I'm trying to get
[30:53] more out into that community and a lot
[30:54] of my girlfriends they consume and and I
[30:57] do too they consume a lot of Lifestyle
[31:00] content life travel cooking kind of
[31:04] fashion and it's like how do you
[31:06] incorporate Bitcoin with that that's the
[31:09] question you should start a daily flog
[31:12] maybe that's that's what there's there's
[31:14] something there I just got to try to
[31:16] figure it
[31:18] out um speaking of community I sometimes
[31:22] do that before uh if if a guest is very
[31:24] well known on the podcast I did it with
[31:26] Jeff poof I did it with uh Adam from
[31:29] relay team with some some others where I
[31:31] asked the community hey I have another
[31:33] Brunell on do you have some questions
[31:35] and I think there are like 20 50
[31:38] questions coming up and I picked the the
[31:40] three that I found most interesting uh
[31:43] and the first question would be like if
[31:46] Bitcoin wouldn't be here what would you
[31:48] do right
[31:49] now great question um I would probably
[31:53] be really passionate about
[31:56] gold I'd be about the gold standard I
[31:59] think at the same time I would be um I
[32:01] worry that I would be very pessimistic
[32:03] about the future because I was getting
[32:05] to that place where I looked at the
[32:08] future and I thought how am I going to
[32:11] afford a family how am I going to afford
[32:13] a house um am I going to need five jobs
[32:16] just to keep up with the cost of living
[32:18] I was just I was looking at the future
[32:19] with a lot of fear and anxiety and now I
[32:22] look at it with a lot of
[32:24] Hope yeah it's it's uh Bitcoin doesn't
[32:27] do a lot things and I think Bitcoin
[32:29] stole a lot of brain energy from
[32:33] gold over the years yeah tot except for
[32:36] Peter schiffs we're
[32:38] waiting I don't know I kind of gave up I
[32:41] think we we will wait a long time but
[32:44] let's see um do you see and this is
[32:49] bigger question but I think the answer
[32:50] is no but it's a bigger question to like
[32:53] think about it um do you see a danger of
[32:56] Bitcoin ETF Central izing
[33:00] Bitcoin I don't and I think uh Lyn Alden
[33:03] has been doing a really great job sort
[33:04] of reporting on the the the actual facts
[33:08] of this when you look at the
[33:09] distribution of Bitcoin how how very
[33:11] little is concentrated with any of these
[33:14] um ETF issuers but also just in general
[33:17] I mean they could rack up they could
[33:19] they could buy up a million Bitcoin
[33:20] right now at these Wall Street firms and
[33:22] they will have no greater influence over
[33:24] the protocol that is the beauty of proof
[33:26] of work the fact that it is it is ryant
[33:29] on energy it is ryant on this randomized
[33:33] system that gives no one an extra
[33:36] advantage and it's distributed around
[33:38] the globe so no I'm not worried about it
[33:40] I understand that people are a little
[33:41] bit wary and and they see it as sort of
[33:44] the the Legacy Financial system oozing
[33:46] into this space that's all about
[33:48] decentralization and freedom but if you
[33:50] don't like the ETFs you don't have to
[33:52] buy them that's what's great you could
[33:54] buy the real thing and self- custody it
[33:56] which is I think the the P purest truest
[33:58] form of Bitcoin but the fact that it's
[34:01] an option for say Pension funds and and
[34:04] investors that are dipping their toes in
[34:05] and financial advisors I think it's just
[34:07] all a creative and it benefits all of us
[34:10] yeah it's totally agree it's like even
[34:12] if they buy Lots they cannot control it
[34:14] and there's not too many Bitcoin
[34:16] available anyway so uh Bitcoin is not
[34:20] they're going to drive up the price they
[34:21] already
[34:23] are um B uh you you're a lot on Fox News
[34:27] and actually this was an question that
[34:30] came up in the community but also the
[34:32] last guest I have an Andro and the last
[34:34] guest asked a question for the next
[34:36] guest um and similar question came up
[34:39] you're really good now on on Fox News I
[34:41] love your Snippets when when you on Fox
[34:44] News and and and I think I don't know if
[34:46] you're also on other media outlets and
[34:49] the question would be um what media
[34:51] Outlet would you love to be on to
[34:53] educate uh about Bitcoin Joe Rogan
[34:57] podcast
[34:58] because it has such a big audience and
[35:00] he's like he's a bitcoiner but not fully
[35:02] there um you know I just think we need
[35:04] to get out the message to the to the
[35:07] highest number of people so anyone who
[35:09] has that kind of platform and influence
[35:11] they are the ones that need to be orange
[35:13] pilled because um when when you build an
[35:15] audience like that the audience really
[35:17] trusts you and so the potential there to
[35:19] orange pill millions and millions of
[35:21] people is really incredible I also think
[35:23] we need to orange pill more you know
[35:25] nation state leaders um Joe Rogan show
[35:28] that would be my dream did you hear the
[35:31] speech of May puka I think it was all
[35:34] over my tw Twitter feed right
[35:37] today uh if it was today no I haven't
[35:39] seen it yet it was where maybe it was
[35:42] also yesterday but where he talked about
[35:45] that fear there's a bubble that will
[35:47] burst and and the I don't know like in
[35:50] Washington I think he gave the speech
[35:51] really really cool yeah no he's been
[35:54] great he's been great speaking about it
[35:55] and uh the performance is speaking for
[35:57] itself right now yeah definitely yeah um
[36:01] we have this tine uh and this kind of
[36:03] comes back to the the the Fox Fox
[36:05] Business where the last guest asked a
[36:07] question about U for the next guest and
[36:10] your last guest was the the CEO and
[36:13] co-founder of um Geer the mamic oh yeah
[36:17] and he asked you're so much on on Fox
[36:20] News and Fox Business when will you be
[36:23] running it well um I think that in the
[36:26] future they will have more shows or um
[36:29] content that
[36:31] is about Bitcoin maybe I don't know I
[36:34] mean you know they can call me I'm
[36:36] available I don't know it's it's it's so
[36:38] freeing To Be Your Own Boss and to
[36:41] create your own content like I'm just so
[36:43] grateful for what I'm doing there are
[36:46] things that I I miss about the network
[36:48] life you know it's it's fun to work with
[36:50] a a big team of people because it's so
[36:52] collaborative and I have worked with
[36:53] some amazing editors and producers over
[36:55] my career um I love the collaborative
[36:59] spirit and energy and creativity but I
[37:01] just I I feel so empowered that I get to
[37:05] interview people and ask the questions
[37:08] that I want to ask based on my research
[37:10] and and there is a lot of responsibility
[37:12] on my shoulders right and I really take
[37:14] it as a huge Duty and responsibility to
[37:16] do my homework and make sure I'm putting
[37:18] accurate information out there um but
[37:20] it's such like a it's so fulfilling and
[37:22] it's such an honor that I get to do this
[37:25] and I've created it all no one handed it
[37:27] to me and I'm not beholden to anyone I
[37:29] did it all by myself so so I don't know
