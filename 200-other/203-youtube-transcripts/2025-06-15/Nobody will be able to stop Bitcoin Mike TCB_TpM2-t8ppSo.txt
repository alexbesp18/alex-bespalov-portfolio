[00:00] all of bitcoin's life has been a super
[00:01] cycle at some point they're going to
[00:03] realize it's just going to start eating
[00:04] its way through the floorboards they're
[00:05] not going to be able to stop it Bitcoin
[00:07] is forcing America to be American again
[00:10] the fact that we're adding a trillion
[00:11] dollars of national debt every hundred
[00:13] days here in the US there's a reason
[00:15] that there's Bitcoin ETFs and there's
[00:17] not dog with hat ETFs and there's a
[00:19] reason that like political candidates
[00:21] are talking about Bitcoin and they're
[00:22] not talking about Pepe coin or Dogecoin
[00:24] this kind of Hungry Hungry Hippo game
[00:26] has been eating up 500 million a day for
[00:28] the past couple months as soon as that
[00:30] cell pressure is gone there's not
[00:32] another giant seller in the market we've
[00:34] been given this tool by Satoshi that you
[00:37] can protect yourself and put your
[00:39] productive capacity in an
[00:40] unconfiscatable
[00:41] place I saw one tweet of yours that
[00:44] Bitcoin is forcing America to be
[00:46] American again which I found really
[00:49] interesting as I'm European and I see
[00:52] like a lot of things that are really
[00:53] cool In America which I would be like
[00:56] the European Union should should adopt
[00:59] those uh but what what's unamerican
[01:01] about America right now uh yeah I mean I
[01:05] think um in some ways I think we've lost
[01:07] our way and I think I have a lot of hope
[01:08] that Bitcoin is going to restore those
[01:10] American ideals so I think of just the
[01:13] way that kind of how we were founded was
[01:16] this idea of like life liberty property
[01:19] which was the old John Lock um
[01:22] philosophy which got turned into life
[01:23] liberty pursuit of happiness but the way
[01:26] that it's almost like Bitcoin becomes a
[01:27] forcing function for um kind of that
[01:31] constitutional republic which was the
[01:33] original idea of America and I think
[01:35] it's a way that we can kind of remind us
[01:37] of where we came from where we strayed
[01:39] from and get us back to that and then I
[01:41] think it's a it's a forcing function
[01:43] that can restore the American ideals not
[01:45] only for us but then also export those
[01:47] ideals to all over the world that you
[01:49] know is maybe living under a different
[01:52] political system or authoritarian regime
[01:54] where it's going to be very difficult to
[01:57] Institute that political change but if
[01:59] it's kind of forces it from the
[02:01] Grassroots level so the way I kind of
[02:03] think about that as far as just making
[02:04] America more American is life it allows
[02:07] you to pursue whatever you want to do
[02:09] with your productive capacity and your
[02:11] time and that it allows you to actually
[02:13] save the fruits of the the that labor in
[02:15] a place that cannot be um siphoned off
[02:17] and cannot be debased uh Liberty it's a
[02:21] censorship resistant protocol so it's
[02:22] not going to censor you or decide who
[02:24] can participate or who cannot
[02:26] participate or which transactions can go
[02:27] through and which transactions can't go
[02:29] through and then the idea of property
[02:31] it's just completely unconfiscatable so
[02:33] it's it's not something that we're kind
[02:35] of used to um your regular kind of
[02:38] property that can be either highly taxed
[02:41] or just taken against your will or
[02:43] redistributed against your will so I
[02:45] think it it does those and then if you
[02:46] just kind of go into like the American
[02:48] underpinning of the Bill of Rights right
[02:50] off the bat you got freedom of speech
[02:52] using a censorship resistant protocol
[02:54] allows you to have freedom of speech in
[02:56] both just what you say because you don't
[02:58] have to worry about censorship and then
[03:00] actually transact because there's no
[03:02] censorship on your transactions if you
[03:04] go through the Second Amendment which is
[03:06] kind of like our right to bear arms here
[03:07] in America um I don't know if you read
[03:09] like Jason Lowry's soft War thesis but a
[03:12] lot of bitcoiners came after Jason Lowry
[03:14] about that about hey bitcoin's not a
[03:16] weapon you know that's not what's going
[03:18] on here but I think they kind of
[03:19] misunderstood what he was trying to
[03:21] communicate there which was um Bitcoin
[03:24] is a way that you can Pro protect the
[03:27] trade routes of the 21st century so just
[03:29] just like we have an army to protect
[03:31] land rout land trade routes and you have
[03:33] a Navy to protect Naval routes and you
[03:34] have an Air Force to protect air rots
[03:36] now you have this cyber cyber rails of
[03:39] cyers um you know cyber the Cyber
[03:42] economy and this is a way to use
[03:44] non-lethal Force protection to protect
[03:47] your access to the trade rots of the
[03:49] 21st digital economy so it wasn't really
[03:52] using it as a weapon it was using it the
[03:55] same way that our Second Amendment is
[03:57] where you use the uh Force protection to
[04:00] protect your rights protect your access
[04:02] to the trade roots of the economy of the
[04:04] 21st century so and Jason Lowry even
[04:07] speaks to that specifically about how
[04:09] we're kind of reaching the kinetic
[04:10] ceiling where it's our weapons are so
[04:13] Advanced now that if we get into like a
[04:15] real peer peer on peer kinetic War it
[04:19] could be you know the destruction of the
[04:20] entire human race so we need another way
[04:22] to project power that doesn't actually
[04:25] threaten our you know lives of hundreds
[04:28] of millions of people so um that I think
[04:30] it aligns with the Second Amendment the
[04:32] third amendment I won't go through every
[04:34] Amendment here Robin but the third
[04:35] amendment is more about quartering
[04:37] soldiers at a time of war and then uh
[04:39] but then the Fourth Amendment which is
[04:41] um you know unreasonable search and
[04:43] seizure protecting your property against
[04:44] unreasonable search and seizure Bitcoin
[04:46] is a place that you can store your
[04:47] energy in a property that cannot be
[04:49] seized cannot be redistributed and
[04:51] cannot be confiscated against your will
[04:53] so I think it just it aligns with all of
[04:56] these kind of American ideals
[04:58] that um we've kind of forgotten about
[05:01] because the way the Constitution was
[05:03] written it was intentionally written to
[05:05] be very very difficult to change because
[05:08] you know to uh to actually uh have an
[05:12] amendment put to the Constitution it
[05:13] takes two-thirds of Congress and
[05:15] two-thirds of the states and then to
[05:16] ratify that it takes three fours of the
[05:18] states it has this consensus mechanism
[05:20] that's very very difficult to change by
[05:23] Design but I feel like it got so
[05:25] difficult to change that we just chose
[05:27] to ignore it instead so instead of
[05:30] really abiding by the Constitutional
[05:32] limits of government we chose to just do
[05:35] whatever we felt like and just kind of
[05:36] cram it all under the Commerce Clause of
[05:38] the Constitution and not really worry
[05:40] about that consensus mechanism anymore
[05:42] and I think in parallel the beauty of
[05:44] the Bitcoin consensus mechanism is you
[05:46] cannot cheat it it's not um susceptible
[05:49] to the same corruption or human
[05:52] fallibility you can't just choose to
[05:54] ignore the rules because the protocol
[05:56] enforces the rules it's just mathematics
[05:58] so you actually can't circumvent the
[06:01] consensus mechanism in the same way that
[06:03] we have with the Constitution so I think
[06:06] a long-winded answer there but I think
[06:08] that's how it kind of aligns with all
[06:10] the original American ideals and since
[06:12] we're kind of at a point where I don't
[06:14] think America can vote its way out of
[06:17] this problem anymore or restore those
[06:18] ideals at The Ballot Box it gives you a
[06:21] way to um you know kind of voice power
[06:24] in a different way which is just to opt
[06:26] out of a system that's no longer serving
[06:28] us
[06:30] yeah definitely and I think uh as you
[06:33] said right it's a it's about the game
[06:35] here right uh because uh we are above
[06:39] this point where a country can do steps
[06:42] against Bitcoin and and Bitcoin will
[06:43] fail I think we above this point now so
[06:46] now the only question is who what which
[06:49] countries will go first and then I am in
[06:52] the European Union in Austria and I'm
[06:54] like it's not looking good like a
[06:57] European Union is setting uh the the
[06:59] steps in the wrong direction I think uh
[07:02] America is kind of good about it there a
[07:04] lot of companies there a lot of things
[07:06] there happening again measured against
[07:08] the European Union but there are also
[07:10] countries like Argentina that might be
[07:13] in Advantage there are countries
[07:14] obviously like as Salvador that might
[07:16] have an advantage what do you think
[07:18] currently uh the politic political
[07:21] political force in America how they do
[07:24] the view Bitcoin is it friendly or like
[07:27] could it be better obviously
[07:30] uh yeah I mean I think it's both of
[07:31] those things I think um the beauty about
[07:33] this is I I do think you're right game
[07:35] theoretically at the nation state level
[07:37] it does seem like everyone's kind of
[07:39] side eyeing each other I think about
[07:40] this almost like the uh the old Good the
[07:42] Bad and the Ugly or like a showdown the
[07:43] okay Corral where everyone's kind of got
[07:45] their hand over their pistol and they're
[07:46] kind of like are we doing this because
[07:47] if we're doing this we got to go first
[07:50] like you got to be the one that draws
[07:51] breaks leather first that's what gives
[07:53] you the advantage so I do think that
[07:55] there's that happening at the nation
[07:56] state level they're just not really sure
[07:58] yet if this is happening I think I think
[08:01] uh I think governments are kind of slow
[08:03] they're a little behind the trend when
[08:04] it comes to what Bitcoin is really doing
[08:07] I think um the ETFs are almost like a
[08:10] trojan horse where they kind of let it
[08:12] inside the castle walls thinking I think
[08:14] maybe they thought they were going to be
[08:15] able to control or manipulate this the
[08:18] way they kind of have the gold market
[08:19] for a number of years um but I think at
[08:22] some point they're going to realize it's
[08:23] just going to start eating its way
[08:24] through the floorboards they're not
[08:25] going to be able to stop it the um the
[08:29] hope I have in America is being a
[08:31] constitutional republic we have exactly
[08:34] what you said it's being treated by
[08:36] certain States in certain ways places
[08:38] like Texas that are very big into the
[08:40] Bitcoin mining space are taking steps to
[08:42] Pro like protect it and actually give it
[08:44] political protections um I'm sure I
[08:47] don't know if you've had Dennis Porter
[08:48] on your show but I'm sure you're very
[08:49] familiar with what he's doing going to
[08:51] all these different states and try to
[08:52] pack state-by-state legislation that
[08:54] protects your rights to self- custody
[08:55] protects your rights to you know kind of
[08:57] interact with Bitcoin as you see fit
[09:00] and um just like we have been under this
[09:03] kind of ever growing federal government
[09:05] that kind of ignores state rights to a
[09:07] certain degree because they've been able
[09:08] to amass so much power through this
[09:10] inflationary monetary system that
[09:12] siphons monetary power from the people
[09:14] and just concentrates it at the top I
[09:17] think Bitcoin is one of the better
[09:19] examples of how uh in the US the states
[09:22] were meant to have atomy and state power
[09:25] and that only certain things were going
[09:26] to be Federal such as uniting for a
[09:28] common defense and the idea that we were
[09:30] going to have to you know unite to like
[09:32] repel Invasion from a foreign foe so uh
[09:35] a lot of these states like Texas like
[09:37] Wyoming like Florida have really started
[09:39] kind of flexing their state rights power
[09:41] and I think no tool that's better for
[09:44] flexing state rights power than Bitcoin
[09:46] so I think you're going to see a number
[09:48] of different approaches just like
[09:49] Bitcoin is jurisdictional on a global
[09:51] scale it's also jurisdiction list in the
[09:54] United States on a state scale where
[09:56] certain states are going to treat it
[09:57] better certain states are going to try
[09:59] to have kind of arduous um rules and
[10:02] regulations against it and then you're
[10:03] just going to see that laboratory of
[10:05] democracy where um I in my humble
[10:08] opinion I think the states that adopt it
[10:10] are going to flourish and the ones that
[10:12] choose to try to um put kind of uous
[10:15] regulations on it are going to push
[10:17] businesses and Innovation and
[10:18] opportunities outside of their state
[10:20] borders and we're just going to see
[10:22] those systems grow in parallel and I
[10:24] have every faith in the Bitcoin
[10:26] incentive system that the ones that
[10:28] choose to integrate adopt Bitcoin
[10:30] soonest are the ones that are going to
[10:31] prosper the
[10:33] most definitely and I even heard
[10:35] something about a law against cbdcs in
[10:39] America is this a thing yeah they yeah
[10:41] some states have done that yeah so like
[10:43] the State of Florida has passed a law
[10:44] that they were not going to allow a
[10:46] cbdc um yeah I mean I I think in some
[10:49] ways I mean we'll see how that rolls out
[10:51] I think that's I think that fight is
[10:53] coming so I think the cbdc is going to
[10:55] be tried I think um I also find faith in
[11:00] the American government that it's going
[11:01] to fail you know I I could see them kind
[11:04] of playing out some way where they look
[11:07] at these ETFs they decide that hey we've
[11:09] proved these Bitcoin ETFs that's going
[11:11] to be our sanctioned way that you can
[11:14] gain exposure to bitcoin but we're GNA
[11:17] say that maybe self- custody is not
[11:19] allowed because that's what we're going
[11:21] to say terrorists are going to use to
[11:22] finance or that's what we're going to
[11:24] say illicit finances done with I could
[11:26] see them potentially trying to do that
[11:28] but I also just have faith that that
[11:30] approach is going to fail because I
[11:32] think of all the other things that are
[11:34] much easier to control that the
[11:37] government has failed to control whether
[11:38] it be prohibition or marijuana laws or
[11:41] those things that come into like easy
[11:43] examples uh they failed to stop those
[11:45] things and those things they had much
[11:47] better control jurisdictionally over
[11:49] than something like Bitcoin that you can
[11:51] just memorize the words in your head and
[11:52] take it anywhere in the earth that it's
[11:54] treated best so uh I wouldn't be
[11:56] surprised if that was coming but I also
[11:58] have faith that that it's not going to
[12:01] work so I think there's a reckoning
[12:02] coming where you have cbdcs versus um
[12:06] versus Bitcoin probably in the some
[12:08] point in the future uh but I think that
[12:11] their problem is that cbdcs don't solve
[12:14] any of the problems that Bitcoin does
[12:16] solve right so they're going to point to
[12:18] and you already see this in politics in
[12:19] America they point to the speed of
[12:21] payments as if the only reason that
[12:23] Bitcoin showed up was that it was some
[12:25] kind of new digital money that could
[12:27] travel faster and that's all that it was
[12:29] solving and they never speak to the
[12:31] inflation part they never speak to the
[12:33] fact that we're completely indebted all
[12:35] the math is just going to accelerate and
[12:37] we're going to have to debase the
[12:38] currency at an accelerated rate they
[12:40] never speak to that part so I think um
[12:43] you know when you kind of like try to
[12:45] sell these two currencies like a
[12:47] elevator pitch for a cbdc and an
[12:49] elevator pitch for Bitcoin it was like
[12:51] well you know just go down the list of
[12:54] Bitcoin qualities and try to apply them
[12:56] to a cbdc is as a central bank did
[12:59] digital currency is it going to be
[13:00] absolutely scarce to protect you against
[13:02] debasement of course not like it's just
[13:04] going to be a digital currency that they
[13:05] can create infinite units of is it going
[13:07] to be censorship resistant of course not
[13:10] they're going to actually potentially
[13:12] program it try to control people's
[13:13] behavior social engineer through this
[13:15] tool they're going to be able to turn
[13:17] off your livelihood at the flip of a
[13:19] switch if they feels like that you're a
[13:21] bad actor of some kind um and then is it
[13:23] going to be confiscate and it was like
[13:25] of course it's going to be confiscate if
[13:27] it's government money kind of the whole
[13:28] point point is that it's going to be
[13:30] able to they're going to you know if
[13:31] they decide that taxes should be 10%
[13:33] higher overnight then they can just turn
[13:35] that turn that function on it's not even
[13:37] going to require any kind of um input
[13:41] from the populace at all so it's going
[13:42] to be 100% confiscate so all the things
[13:44] that Bitcoin offers you in relation to
[13:47] the old Fiat money all the problems of
[13:49] the old Fiat money the fact that it's
[13:52] it's getting debased at will and
[13:54] everyone's productive capacity is
[13:56] getting confiscated the fact that they
[13:57] can censor bank accounts so they could
[13:59] turn off bank accounts uh the fact that
[14:01] they could confiscate it through uh
[14:03] either inflation or taxation all of
[14:05] those problems actually get worse under
[14:07] a central bank digital currency than
[14:09] they even are under a fiat currency so
[14:11] um it it exacerbates all of the
[14:13] detriments of the Fiat system and it
[14:15] provides none of the benefits of a bit
[14:17] Bitcoin system so I just think in when
[14:20] those two candidates run in parallel
[14:22] everybody is going to uh see the
[14:25] benefits of Bitcoin in relation to the
[14:27] cbdc probably even
[14:29] easier than they could see that in
[14:31] relation to the Fiat money system it's
[14:33] like I think in some ways the pitch for
[14:36] a central bank digital currency is going
[14:38] to be the best advertisement for Bitcoin
[14:39] that we've ever
[14:41] had I I heard that a lot actually it's
[14:44] it's like uh once the government is
[14:46] saying oh you can have this digital
[14:48] wallet and it has value and you don't
[14:51] need the cash anymore you you don't like
[14:53] the cbdc becomes a trojan horse for
[14:56] Bitcoin at this point because then
[14:58] people just have like two digital values
[15:00] and the one is constantly losing value
[15:03] and the one is constantly gaining value
[15:05] and then they of course Bitcoin is uh
[15:07] outg growing that but I also think uh
[15:10] Bitcoin uh people like when when I see
[15:14] most people you s s you have seen this
[15:17] with the world coin uh it's so easy to
[15:19] get people some small incentive and then
[15:22] they are standing two hours in line to
[15:25] scan their ears or do something weird so
[15:29] uh I what I fear a little bit is that
[15:32] they are doing crazy incentive
[15:34] incentives to use their currencies with
[15:37] tax advantages with stuff like that uh
[15:40] but in the long run like this is just
[15:42] shortterm medium-term uh noise that's
[15:46] going on but still this noise can uh
[15:48] damage a lot of lives I think longterm
[15:51] no chance against Bitcoin because it's
[15:53] just just a shitcoin with more control
[15:56] with more monitoring of the
[15:59] it's like there's nothing good about it
[16:02] maybe we can transact now feat on the
[16:05] weekends uh directly uh without any
[16:08] things like okay there might be some
[16:10] some advantages but nothing that's not
[16:13] better on
[16:14] bitcoin uh and the whole whole political
[16:18] system I think it's it's it's
[16:19] interesting to think about because when
[16:22] we have Bitcoin uh we can move it around
[16:25] we can just remember it in in our head
[16:27] and we can go from border to border
[16:28] order what do you think will this make
[16:32] uh with with our complete Society but
[16:34] also our political systems also with
[16:37] taxes and stuff like that what what do
[16:39] you see coming uh do we have this in um
[16:43] how is this book called The sovereignty
[16:46] uh the book uh the sovereign individual
[16:49] I forgot yeah sovereign individual yeah
[16:51] there you go uh do we see this this
[16:54] future
[16:55] coming uh I mean yeah I think it's
[16:57] anybody's guess to see how that shakes
[16:59] out I think the big thing Bitcoin is
[17:00] doing is it's changing the relationship
[17:03] it's rewiring the relationship where um
[17:06] governments going to be forced to choose
[17:07] how they treat their citizens because I
[17:09] think they've gotten very used to this
[17:11] idea of okay we we tax them at a certain
[17:13] rate that doesn't even have to balance
[17:15] our budget we can just move with the
[17:18] back door tax of inflation we can meet
[17:20] any budget deficit through printing of
[17:22] currency and just kind of steal in a way
[17:24] that nobody is really aware of unless
[17:25] they're really paying attention to the
[17:27] economic system they see the price is
[17:29] rising but they don't exactly understand
[17:30] the mechanics of why those prices are
[17:32] rising I don't know what it's like in
[17:34] Austria but at least in America they
[17:35] still kind of look toward corporations
[17:37] and think that this is just kind of
[17:38] greedy corporations and that's the
[17:40] reason the price is rising they haven't
[17:41] really connected the dots yet they
[17:43] haven't connected the math to you know
[17:45] these trillion dollar deficits or couple
[17:47] trillion dollar deficits the fact that
[17:49] we're adding a trillion dollars of
[17:50] national debt every hundred days here in
[17:52] the US and that that is causing us to
[17:54] have to print more units of currency
[17:57] which is just supply and demand when you
[17:58] got more money chasing fewer Goods like
[18:00] we we were speaking of Jeff Booth
[18:02] earlier that causes the prices to rise
[18:04] it's just a it's just a matter of when
[18:05] you have more money chasing the same
[18:07] amount of productivity prices has to
[18:09] rise so I think we're we're having
[18:11] trouble diagnosing that problem and to
[18:13] your point about cbdcs I do Envision a
[18:16] world where well the government's not
[18:18] going to tell you that they're causing
[18:19] these price Rises they're not going to
[18:21] say that hey we're we're you know it's
[18:23] our fault that the prices are rising so
[18:25] they're going to Gaslight they're going
[18:26] to do whatever and if they try to roll
[18:27] out a cbdc I do believe it'll be through
[18:29] something like Universal basic income
[18:31] where hey let us help alleviate some of
[18:33] your economic pressure we will we will
[18:36] provide you money but it'll have to be
[18:38] in this sanctioned Central Bank digital
[18:40] currency that's probably the most likely
[18:42] way that they try to roll out a central
[18:44] bank digital currency um but I think in
[18:47] some ways it's always been I'm not sure
[18:49] exactly what the new world looks like I
[18:51] don't know exactly what taxation ends up
[18:53] looking like but I do know that it kind
[18:55] of breaks their Monopoly on Truth when
[18:57] it comes to money where where uh we've
[18:59] always been in this kind of Relativity
[19:01] game and I know they they play this in
[19:03] like in America all the time where
[19:04] they're like okay well you know maybe
[19:06] dollars aren't perfect maybe we are
[19:08] printing money but we're not printing it
[19:09] as badly as Argentina is or as Venezuela
[19:14] is or as turkey is or where so it's
[19:16] always this kind of relative game kind
[19:18] of the cleanest dirty shirt as you will
[19:21] but uh the problem I think they have now
[19:23] is now we have a clean shirt so the same
[19:26] mechanics that push people in Argentina
[19:28] to to go to dollars as a safe haven
[19:31] that's going to push people in dollars
[19:32] to bitcoin as a safe haven so the same
[19:35] math is at play and I think you hear
[19:36] this sometimes talk about like you
[19:38] people bring up like at what price would
[19:41] you sell your Bitcoin or something like
[19:43] that and I think this if you think about
[19:45] it relative to other currencies um it's
[19:47] how we've always thought about it but if
[19:50] um say what price would the dollars have
[19:52] to go in Turkish ler before you trade
[19:55] your dollars for Turkish L you're not
[19:57] going to do that unless you need Turkish
[19:59] L for some reason like unless you're in
[20:01] Turkey you need to spend it for some
[20:03] reason but the same mechanics are play
[20:05] here where you're taking a weaker
[20:06] currency the dollar that's debasing uh
[20:09] maybe not at the same rate as the
[20:11] Turkish lerra but also is facing budget
[20:13] deficits and unfunded liabilities that
[20:15] you know it's going to be debased at an
[20:17] accelerated rate moving forward and
[20:20] you're putting you're trading that for a
[20:21] stronger currency and the the time to
[20:24] trade that back is never un I mean there
[20:26] you never trade a a stronger currency
[20:28] for a weaker currency unless you have to
[20:31] unless you need it for a transactional
[20:33] need and you want to spend it on
[20:34] something so I'm not sure exactly what
[20:37] it all looks like but I do know if the
[20:40] whole world sees all of these debasing
[20:43] Fiat currencies in the same way and they
[20:45] all see Bitcoin as a safe haven and we
[20:47] all get on the same sheet of music when
[20:49] it comes to value that does change the
[20:52] friction of global economic trade and
[20:55] Global kind of Taxation and all of those
[20:57] things because now now there's no um you
[21:00] can frictionally trade globally with any
[21:02] trading partner without having to do any
[21:04] kind of currency exchange without having
[21:06] to do any kind of math you're all under
[21:08] the same sheet of music when it comes to
[21:09] Value it's very hard to benefit from you
[21:12] know uh sweat shop labor wages in one
[21:15] part of the world as an input to a
[21:17] product that you're selling in another
[21:18] part of the world because everybody is
[21:19] kind of pricing things in the same unit
[21:21] of account if Bitcoin really gets to be
[21:24] Global money at some point um so and
[21:27] then when it comes to taxation when you
[21:30] have a whole world of people that can
[21:33] not only frictionally trade or
[21:35] frictionless trade with each other but
[21:37] can also in the sovereign individual
[21:38] thesis can take their productive
[21:40] capacity anywhere on Earth and in a way
[21:43] that cannot be confiscated like I'm in a
[21:45] lot of places like the US has like an
[21:47] exit tax if you want to give up your US
[21:49] citizenship you can but then to move any
[21:51] of your property out of the country it's
[21:52] like a 30% tax to take it anywhere but
[21:55] if I could just memorize you know my net
[21:57] worth in my head and just walk across a
[21:59] border it changes that relationship too
[22:01] so I think you have almost like a global
[22:03] competition set off for citizenry and I
[22:06] mean there's there's cultural elements
[22:08] that make people want to stay in their
[22:09] Hometown or their home country like
[22:11] nobody really wants to leave nobody
[22:13] wants to become an economic Refugee but
[22:15] the fact that everyone suddenly has that
[22:17] ability changes the relationship where
[22:21] you can't you can you can only push on
[22:23] your people so hard before they will go
[22:25] for that exit they will take that
[22:26] off-ramp so I don't know exactly how
[22:29] that plays out I don't think anyone
[22:30] knows exactly how that plays out but I
[22:32] do know that individuals all over the
[22:34] world are suddenly financially empowered
[22:37] in a way that they have never been so I
[22:39] do think whatever that ends up looking
[22:41] like it's a Freer future than we like
[22:44] thought we had before Bitcoin came on
[22:46] the
[22:47] scene yeah and especially if you talk
[22:49] about this game theory um the the
[22:53] highest Capital uh and the biggest
[22:56] companies the higher Network individuals
[22:59] uh they hurt the economy the most if
[23:01] they leave and they are the easiest to
[23:03] leave they are like oh I get now uh 20%
[23:07] more taxes uh so I can save two million
[23:10] Euros or like two Bitcoin a year uh in
[23:14] this other country of course I move
[23:16] there I can still visit here like five
[23:18] four months a year or something like
[23:20] that so I think this game theory will
[23:23] play out even faster uh because we have
[23:27] those uh
[23:29] those people at the top that move a lot
[23:32] of capital and this it gets easier and
[23:34] easier and it gets down and down in the
[23:37] in the in the yeah population and it
[23:39] gets easier for for yeah the average
[23:41] show to just move and go but of course
[23:43] there's this cultural thing there's
[23:45] people that just want to stay with their
[23:47] family just want to stay in the area
[23:48] where they born and this is fine yeah
[23:51] and what do you see with the Bitcoin IND
[23:52] of coming uh and I I mean we have it
[23:55] every cycle and there's this talk about
[23:57] the super super cycle I feel I feel like
[24:00] every cycle is talk of a POS possibility
[24:02] of a super cycle uh but Pon ETF actually
[24:06] brings a lot more capital in uh will it
[24:09] be this time could it be different uh
[24:12] and what's your thoughts on the Bitcoin
[24:14] ETF yeah Ian I like the super cycle idea
[24:17] I mean I think in some ways if you zoom
[24:19] out all of bitcoin's life has been a
[24:21] super cycle we just kind of like we just
[24:23] focus on the the four-year bumps but re
[24:25] in reality the entire thing has been a
[24:27] super cycle it's the best performing
[24:28] asset since its Inception over two years
[24:31] 5 years 10 years I think that's going to
[24:33] continue for the next two 5 10 moving
[24:35] forward um yeah I think that the the
[24:38] thing about the ETFs is I think this was
[24:41] almost expected not that they would be
[24:42] approved but the idea that as Bitcoin
[24:45] grows in market cap as it grows in
[24:47] liquidity every time it kind of unlocks
[24:49] a new layer of players and then the the
[24:53] liquidity that comes from those new
[24:54] layers of players unlocks the next layer
[24:56] of players so I I think ETFs we kind of
[24:59] went from individuals to uh Financial
[25:03] managers to corporations eventually
[25:06] Sovereign wealth funds eventually nation
[25:07] states and every time you kind of level
[25:10] up you increase that market cap you
[25:12] increase that liquidity you increase the
[25:14] um potential for different players to
[25:16] get involved and I I think what I think
[25:19] the question is um the other Cycles kind
[25:23] of it was almost like a poker game
[25:25] amongst bitcoiners where they were just
[25:26] trying to trade amongst each other it
[25:28] was was like Hey I'm going to try to
[25:29] call the top and get back in at the
[25:30] bottom but I'm going to trade in a way
[25:33] that I'm going to I'm going to try to
[25:35] find another Bitcoin or to buy it here
[25:36] that doesn't think it's the top yet and
[25:38] then sell it back and buy it back at the
[25:40] bottom I think the difference between
[25:42] these kind of passive inflows that you
[25:43] have from the ETFs being unlocked is now
[25:46] what I mean it's the most successful ETF
[25:49] launch of all time it's taking it about
[25:51] $500 million of new capital a day I
[25:55] think that's just getting started
[25:57] because it was you know most of the
[25:59] people that are going to start pitching
[26:00] this to their clients the like
[26:02] registered investment advisers they're
[26:04] just starting to form an opinion on this
[26:06] so they haven't really started pushing
[26:08] it on their people yet they haven't
[26:09] really started suggesting it to their
[26:11] clients yet whether it be 1% or 3% or 5%
[26:14] whatever their allocation ends up being
[26:16] um so I think that that passive inflow
[26:19] is is going to
[26:21] continue and whether that gets to the
[26:23] point that it outstrips demand to such a
[26:26] degree that you don't you don't you I
[26:28] mean you never get that correction ever
[26:30] again I think what it probably does it
[26:32] probably outstrips the supply with more
[26:34] Force maybe gets to a higher blowoff top
[26:37] that has to mean revert to a certain
[26:39] degree but I also think it's I mean it's
[26:42] not an outside possibility that you hit
[26:43] flas point where as you start unlocking
[26:46] like I mean hypothetically you imagine
[26:48] these ETFs they do unlock uh say you
[26:51] know you have like micro strategy but
[26:53] say say it pushes hard enough that you
[26:54] unlock an apple or you unlock a Google
[26:56] or you unlock a meta or you unlock a
[26:58] whatever player and then they help push
[27:01] it faster it almost gives it like
[27:03] another rocket booster part of the orbit
[27:05] where it gets to another level and then
[27:07] you do see that game theory um amongst
[27:10] nation states kick off if the if the
[27:13] game theory amongst nation states kicks
[27:15] off uh you know I don't think nation
[27:18] states are going to be trying to kind of
[27:19] call the top and B like they're not
[27:20] going to be looking at the pi cycle top
[27:22] indicator to try to trade it it's just
[27:24] going to start off like uh kind of like
[27:26] the Michael sailor Gold Rush
[27:29] accumulation game amongst nation states
[27:31] and then it may never correct it may
[27:33] just become a one-way valve that
[27:35] everyone suddenly collectively realizes
[27:37] that the fiat currency game it's it's
[27:40] always been a one-way trip we're never
[27:42] it's it's a trip to Mars we were never
[27:44] going to come back there's no way we're
[27:45] paying it back all we can do is continue
[27:47] to debase all we can do is continue to
[27:49] make the service payments uh and once
[27:52] everyone realizes that that was a
[27:53] one-way trip and this is going to be the
[27:56] collective exit that this is going to be
[27:58] the life raft if those players get
[28:01] unlocked and they all start to go it may
[28:04] just become a one-way valve that you
[28:05] know becomes the Bitcoin black hole and
[28:07] it sucks everything in and it never it
[28:09] never goes back so um I think anyone
[28:12] looking to trade it I think it was it'd
[28:15] be kind of a Fool's airend just like I
[28:17] kind of talked about the Fiat currencies
[28:18] trading them for a stronger currency and
[28:20] then if you just consider it being a
[28:22] trade for a stronger currency you never
[28:25] trade back into that weaker currency
[28:26] unless you have to or unless you need to
[28:28] do it for transactional purchase you
[28:30] want to buy a house you want to buy
[28:31] whatever a boat you want to buy
[28:32] something uh but if everyone starts to
[28:35] understand it as a one way it's not
[28:37] really a it's not a trade it's really
[28:40] just you're pushing your money and
[28:42] you're pushing your Capital into a
[28:43] Better Stronger Faster unconfiscatable
[28:46] place and everyone understands that and
[28:48] it's absolutely scarce it's going to be
[28:51] very difficult if we come to that
[28:52] Collective understanding to make a
[28:55] convincing argument that you should
[28:57] trade of it because there you you may
[29:00] not be able to make the assumption that
[29:01] you can trade back into it like there
[29:03] may be enough people that just lock it
[29:04] away forever and you never get your
[29:06] access to it again so and then they just
[29:09] use it as collateral or capital or
[29:11] borrow against it or you know so you may
[29:13] not be able to have the Liberty that
[29:15] you've had over the last three Cycles to
[29:17] trade back in so whether it's super
[29:19] cycle or not I don't I don't know like I
[29:21] said I think macro the whole thing's
[29:23] been a super cycle I think the safest
[29:26] way to play this is just understand that
[29:28] this is the best money like it's finally
[29:31] we engineered the best money that humans
[29:33] have ever seen and just getting in there
[29:36] and staying there is what's going to
[29:37] make the most sense and whether that
[29:40] means you're going to have to take
[29:41] another draw down as long as you
[29:43] conceptually understand what's going on
[29:45] here you know like yeah maybe you'll
[29:48] save yourself a 30% draw down but maybe
[29:50] you'll miss you'll you'll get off the
[29:51] train and not be able to get back on so
[29:54] I mean I I don't know I think it's going
[29:55] to be interesting but I do think those
[29:58] larger players getting into um an
[30:01] absolutely scarce pool there's
[30:04] definitely going to be a shoving an
[30:05] elephant into a bathtub element here
[30:07] that I'm not sure I'm not sure even
[30:08] we're ready for Robin to be perfectly
[30:10] honest like I think uh even us thinking
[30:13] about this all day talking about this
[30:14] all day I think um the the Dynamics of
[30:19] this ETF roll out the fact that
[30:20] grayscale's been dumping not only the
[30:22] FTX bankruptcy but then the Genesis
[30:24] bankruptcy and it's basically been
[30:26] providing the liquid that this kind of
[30:28] Hungry Hungry Hippo game has been eating
[30:30] up 500 million a day for the past couple
[30:33] months as soon as that cell pressure is
[30:35] gone there's not another giant seller in
[30:38] the market that can kind of meet that
[30:40] demand so it could push pretty fast and
[30:43] pretty hard and then what what eyes that
[30:47] opens up and what players that unlocks
[30:49] and what happens next I think is
[30:50] anybody's guess but I think it's gonna I
[30:52] think it'll surprise to the upside 21
[30:54] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[30:58] teach and preach self- custody this is
[31:00] my goto exchange when someone asks me oh
[31:04] where can I buy my Bitcoin from this is
[31:06] the easiest entry for bitcoiners and if
[31:10] you want lower fees Plus at the same
[31:12] time support this podcast use code Robin
[31:15] and click the link in the description
[31:17] yeah I also think I had uh I think a few
[31:20] days on I published a uh podcast with be
[31:23] the dwor and I put it on the thumbnail
[31:26] because I loved it so much with he's
[31:28] saying uh it will shock all of us like
[31:31] all bitcoiners even will be shocked what
[31:34] Bitcoin is doing and I think um what we
[31:36] can see and what I expect to see at some
[31:39] point I don't know when it starts uh
[31:41] there's this S curve adoption and we are
[31:44] still in this slow adoption phase and
[31:46] there will be this point where we hit
[31:49] all of the sudden in 10 years this 80%
[31:52] Spike of the adoption uh and then we
[31:56] have like since the exeption of Bitcoin
[31:58] we have this like three years up one
[32:00] year down thing and there will come this
[32:02] 10e phase where it's just every year up
[32:05] and it will be massively growing because
[32:07] we reach that ex Inception point where
[32:10] everybody all of the sudden gets it and
[32:12] I think an ETF and he also talks about
[32:15] structure products bonds and stuff like
[32:18] that that have then the the next level
[32:21] that comes in um that could very well
[32:24] happen I don't know when I I'm I'm not
[32:28] good enough to say like this is how it's
[32:31] I I just understand Bitcoin is the best
[32:33] form of money ever and I don't want
[32:36] anything else so I'm 100% in this form
[32:38] this is this is pretty simple for me
[32:41] once you get it uh it's hard to
[32:43] understand this when you have to unlearn
[32:46] all this feared crap you have in your
[32:48] mind since long time I'm I'm 25 so I had
[32:51] not to too much fear mindset before so I
[32:55] did not have to unlearn too much uh and
[32:58] yeah on on the topic of learning um I'm
[33:01] always wondering when we uh and I try to
[33:03] do it with my podcast I try to like what
[33:06] did learn from this this week's podcast
[33:08] and stuff like that and you also have
[33:10] like a lot of podcasts already I think
[33:13] you started in 2022 if I saw it
[33:16] correctly um what what did you learn
[33:18] from from this from this from this
[33:21] episodes from this podcast is there
[33:23] anything you were shocked in in learning
[33:26] uh the podcasting story
[33:28] uh yeah it's interesting so um first of
[33:31] all I love Peter dunworth because he'll
[33:32] just throw out numbers like seven
[33:34] billion and you're just like what what
[33:36] you like is this this for real like and
[33:38] I was like I realized it sounds crazy
[33:40] and but it is funny that you could walk
[33:42] his math back and be like okay I mean
[33:43] $900 trillion dollars of global assets
[33:45] it eats a certain percentage of real
[33:47] estate certain percentage of fixed
[33:48] income certain percentage of this it was
[33:49] like you can see that happening but it
[33:52] does it does it does strike you as crazy
[33:54] when you first hear it but like uh my
[33:57] big takeaway learning I think from doing
[33:59] the podcast experience was um I have I
[34:03] have a graduate degree in International
[34:05] Security and I was doing graduate school
[34:07] work in
[34:09] 200920 time frame when the national jet
[34:12] of the United States was about 10
[34:13] trillion dollars and all the research I
[34:16] was doing was how our national debt was
[34:19] our biggest national security threat Bar
[34:21] None like it wasn't about you know a
[34:23] terrorist in a cave in Afghanistan
[34:24] somewhere it wasn't about like anything
[34:26] anything wasn't kind of like some near
[34:27] peer Annihilation it was national debt
[34:30] is how every Empire goes bankrupt and
[34:32] it's how this one's going to go bankrupt
[34:33] and if we don't get a handle on it soon
[34:35] we're going to be in trouble and clearly
[34:38] nobody read any of my research because
[34:40] we went from 10 trillion to 35 trillion
[34:42] into just over a decade it's getting
[34:45] worse it's accelerating we're going from
[34:47] you know you know trillion dollars every
[34:49] hundred days getting added to that
[34:50] number we're about to roll over all that
[34:52] debt at five or six% it's the math is
[34:55] getting away from us in a place in a way
[34:57] that we cannot outgrow it we cannot tax
[35:00] it we cannot we can't all we can do is
[35:02] continue to debase that currency so I
[35:05] saw the problem early on I never saw
[35:08] Bitcoin as the solution like I was like
[35:11] it's almost embar having having such a
[35:12] good grasp on I was reading Hayek and
[35:15] mises and rothbart and all these guys
[35:17] way before I knew anything about Bitcoin
[35:19] so I I'd done half the work to
[35:21] understand the problem and did not see
[35:23] the solution I'd gotten to the point
[35:24] that I thought we were just screwed I
[35:26] thought we were just getting drunk the
[35:27] Titanic and it was like it's over who
[35:30] cares uh and then finally I came to
[35:33] understand Bitcoin and that gave me all
[35:35] the hope to be like oh there's an actual
[35:36] solution to this problem um I think just
[35:40] like everybody else probably you feel
[35:41] similar doing your podcast project once
[35:44] you see that answer to that problem you
[35:47] almost feel this um impetus to share it
[35:50] with everybody around you at least
[35:53] initially everyone almost like a it'll
[35:55] grandis it it's American example but I
[35:57] almost felt like a Paul Riv type
[35:59] responsibility to run run through the
[36:01] villages with my Lantern and say hey the
[36:04] basement is coming this is the way you
[36:05] protect yourself particularly amongst my
[36:07] inner circle of friends and family and
[36:10] like inner Network and bootstrapping a
[36:12] podcast I mean those are the first
[36:14] people I would reach out to is all the
[36:15] people that I care about the most
[36:18] friends family friends of friends so it
[36:20] was kind of a way not only to get the
[36:23] message out because I noticed I was
[36:25] having conversations one-on-one with
[36:27] people but I was like Hey what if you
[36:28] gave this a little bit of virality what
[36:30] if somebody here was able to share this
[36:32] with their Network their friends and
[36:34] family and then all of those people
[36:37] might listen to it just because they
[36:38] know you know they know Robin Robin
[36:40] comes on my podcast they know him that's
[36:42] kind of cool he was on a podcast I'll
[36:44] give this a listen why not and then it's
[36:46] kind of incumbent on us to say something
[36:48] interesting in that time that perks
[36:50] somebody's interest a little bit more
[36:52] and gets them to dig a little bit more
[36:54] and I mean it's it's somewhat
[36:56] self-serving just because I really
[36:58] really buy into the idea that Bitcoin
[37:01] makes the world a better place it just
[37:03] it's here it works it just needs us to
[37:06] understand it and adopt it and let that
[37:08] Network grow so I think every time you
[37:10] can turn a node on on that Network the
[37:13] network is getting stronger it's getting
[37:15] us closer and closer to having this new
[37:17] system come to fruition so it was it was
[37:20] a way for me to reach out to to people
[37:23] meet them where they're at because I
[37:24] also came to I came to these podcast or
[37:28] I came to like the just like all of us I
[37:29] came to this journey you're kind of
[37:31] searching Bitcoin on YouTube and it's a
[37:33] jungle out there you can get all kinds
[37:35] of bad info and like people with their
[37:37] mouths wide open try to sell you all
[37:39] kinds of so it was it was kind
[37:42] of a way to be a first wrong on the
[37:44] ladder in a place that in a in a noisy
[37:46] world but give you information that you
[37:48] could trust and hopefully kind of build
[37:51] on that trust um what I the big takeaway
[37:55] learning wise I think I got was I was I
[37:58] was a little concerned in the beginning
[37:59] that just letting my guests drive so
[38:02] like I let guests come to my podcast
[38:04] they're kind of the star of the show
[38:06] they're asking the questions they're
[38:07] bringing their big Bitcoin questions to
[38:09] the table and I was like am i g to have
[38:11] the same conversation over and over and
[38:13] over again am I gonna have this like a
[38:15] hundred iterations of just the exact
[38:17] same conversation and what I found was
[38:19] it was really
[38:21] surprising how Diversified people's
[38:25] approaches to something like Bitcoin
[38:26] really are they don't all ask the same
[38:29] questions they're not all concerned
[38:30] about the same things like some people
[38:32] are really curious about you know the
[38:34] technical aspects of it some people are
[38:35] really kind of curious about uh just
[38:37] kind of the larger philosophical or
[38:39] political context of it some people just
[38:41] have no idea and they're like hey man
[38:42] what is bitcoin and why does it matter
[38:45] so it's in a way that I thought I was
[38:48] going to have the same conversation over
[38:49] and over and over again and I I think
[38:51] you're probably seeing this too having
[38:53] this you know Bitcoin conversation every
[38:55] day they all are different everyone
[38:57] comes to this from a different
[38:59] perspective with a different point of
[39:00] view and different curiosity so I came
[39:03] to the conclusion that every Bitcoin
[39:05] conversation is a good Bitcoin
[39:06] conversation because you never really
[39:08] know what message Bitcoin if it's going
[39:11] to be money it's going to touch
[39:12] everything it's going to have an effect
[39:14] on everything so you never really know
[39:17] which thing is going to be peque the
[39:19] interest of which people so the more we
[39:21] can talk about it the more we can do
[39:23] this the more conversations like this we
[39:25] can have I think you just unlock the
[39:28] potential like all you're looking for is
[39:30] that one earworm for every single person
[39:32] that gets them to start paying attention
[39:35] and just like you and I know once you
[39:37] see Bitcoin you can't unsee it like I I
[39:39] don't know if anyone of us knows a
[39:41] Bitcoin person that ceases to be a
[39:44] Bitcoin person for some reason so once
[39:46] you see it you're there and you like you
[39:48] become a node on that Network and then
[39:50] you start doing the same thing with your
[39:51] friends and family so my big thing or my
[39:55] big lesson learned from the podcast
[39:57] experience was everybody needs this a
[40:01] lot of people don't know they need it
[40:02] yet they're all going to be curious in a
[40:04] different way and the more conversations
[40:07] we can have the stronger and stronger
[40:09] we're going to make this movement and
[40:11] the higher higher probability of this
[40:13] really empowering everybody everywhere
[40:15] on Earth becomes every time we talk
[40:18] about
[40:18] it yeah definitely and and I ask it
[40:22] myself a lot of times because I think
[40:24] I'm not needed in Bitcoin like like uh
[40:27] if I stop everything Bitcoin is not
[40:29] changing Bitcoin doesn't care about
[40:31] myself uh it's a hard thing to go to go
[40:35] over because if I get down uh there will
[40:38] there's space for one more podcaster and
[40:41] I mean there's space for 20 more
[40:42] podcaster even if I continue my stuff
[40:44] but that's another topic but even if if
[40:46] if like a Michael sailor says oh I'm
[40:49] selling I'm don't believe like someone
[40:51] else will will do the same thing as he
[40:53] did like the nobody uh is is important
[40:56] in Bitcoin but we all are important in
[40:59] Bitcoin and this is the thing we we have
[41:01] to get through and I just love like for
[41:04] me the origin story of the podcast was
[41:06] Al quite simple uh I crew on Twitter
[41:09] last year quite crazy with I started
[41:11] with 500 and now I'm at over 10,000
[41:14] followers and the thing is like I got to
[41:17] know more bitcoiners I did not like I
[41:20] made English content so a lot of
[41:21] American bitcoiners Australian
[41:23] bitcoiners Indian bitcoiners even uh
[41:26] reached out to me and I reached out to
[41:27] them and we like just went on a zoom
[41:29] call and and just talked uh and I was
[41:32] like at some point I can record that and
[41:34] at the same time I was like oh nice and
[41:36] I have a a video format to my social on
[41:39] social media presence and now I do less
[41:43] and less Twitter and I'm actually just
[41:44] just just focusing on the podcast it's a
[41:47] it's amazing story and yeah it's it's
[41:50] it's it's really nice but when we
[41:52] educate people and when we get go
[41:55] through this this this thing then and I
[41:57] get more and more to this realization
[41:59] this feat should not be alive till now
[42:04] like when you really think of it it
[42:06] amazes me that feat and US dollar and
[42:09] Euro and all the other fat currencies
[42:13] that they are still alive uh do you see
[42:16] a point or probably you you see the
[42:19] point but do you know at what point
[42:22] maybe not year but what do we need to
[42:24] hit that this feat Madness will stop is
[42:27] is do you have to anything in mind is
[42:30] like okay when we hit this or when we
[42:32] achieve this or when this happens then
[42:35] we are over with feeld or will it always
[42:37] continue at some point yeah yeah that's
[42:39] a good question like what's what's the
[42:40] threshold I I think the I think the key
[42:43] point there is I think this idea of
[42:45] having Fiat currencies based on nothing
[42:47] that's the anomaly and I think there's a
[42:50] there's you're always kind of a prisoner
[42:51] of the present like we we only
[42:52] experience our own lifetime so what we
[42:55] experience at a single lifetime we kind
[42:56] of
[42:57] kind of subconsciously believe that
[42:59] that's just how it's always been or
[43:00] that's how it's always going to be but I
[43:02] think the the important thing to kind of
[43:04] understand about Fiat was it is the
[43:06] anomaly I mean if we zoom out we had
[43:08] kind of uh you know gold for thousands
[43:10] of years that it was what we found in
[43:12] the world that met monetary properties
[43:14] the best you know we tried other things
[43:16] we tried Sal we tried salt that's where
[43:18] the word salary comes from or when
[43:20] somebody says like hey this guy's not
[43:21] worth his salt we tried sea shells we
[43:23] tried beads we tried all these we tried
[43:26] R stones gold won that kind of
[43:28] evolutionary process to be the best
[43:30] money because it was the durable
[43:31] fungible scarce all those properties of
[43:33] money that they've debated since ancient
[43:35] Greek times um gold had a couple
[43:38] shortcomings right it was a little too
[43:40] slow it's a little like hard to divide
[43:42] it's a little hard to verify uh you know
[43:44] you can't send it from here to Singapore
[43:46] in 10 minutes like you can with Bitcoin
[43:48] so they created a credit layer on top
[43:50] and like you know somebody like uh Lyn
[43:52] Alden does a brilliant job in broken
[43:54] money kind of breaking down this whole
[43:56] idea of how gold failed for a reason and
[43:59] then we had to have this credit layer on
[44:00] top to increase the velocity of money to
[44:03] keep up with a technologically growing
[44:04] economy uh but then it also had the
[44:07] shortcoming of being prone to human
[44:08] fallibility because if you can abuse
[44:11] power you will abuse power being able to
[44:14] create monetary units out of thin air
[44:16] was something that could be very easily
[44:18] abused and inevitably was abused we
[44:20] created way too many units that the gold
[44:22] could not back so then we embarked on
[44:25] this 50y year experiment of purely Fiat
[44:29] money since
[44:30] 1971 and I I don't know exactly what the
[44:33] timeline is the beauty is that
[44:35] experiment is failing at a a ridiculous
[44:39] rate I mean when you really look at it
[44:40] from a perspective of human evolutionary
[44:44] history 50 years is nothing it is not
[44:47] even a fingernail of time it is not even
[44:50] a blink of time and over that at least
[44:52] in the United States the numbers I'm
[44:54] most familiar with you know since 1971
[44:57] we've gone from like $800 billion do of
[44:59] national debt to $35 trillion of
[45:02] national debt in 50 years so like I mean
[45:05] that is just a a grossly accelerated
[45:08] failure rate I mean you look at some
[45:10] Empire like the Roman Empire who got
[45:12] into the same kind of Problem by
[45:13] clipping coins and debasing their
[45:15] currency but it took them 500 years like
[45:17] we we like we're actually failing at a
[45:19] much faster rate than they did and the
[45:22] fact that we have a reserve currency for
[45:23] the whole world is going to let us kick
[45:25] that can down for for a little while but
[45:29] the it's a compounding interest problem
[45:31] and it's a large numbers problem that
[45:33] it's just going to get faster and faster
[45:35] and faster the debasement is going to
[45:37] happen faster and faster and faster and
[45:39] I think we're already we're at the point
[45:41] of no return where it's you know we're
[45:43] not paying the money back everybody
[45:45] knows that I think it's like uh we still
[45:47] have a hard time wrapping our head
[45:49] around exactly what a trillion dollars
[45:51] is I mean right now if you and I tried
[45:53] to start to count to a trillion just one
[45:56] two three four no breaks no snacks no
[46:00] sleep it would take you 31,000 years to
[46:03] count to one trillion and we have $ 35
[46:06] trillion dollars of debt we're adding a
[46:08] trillion dollars every hundred days I
[46:11] mean that math is just crazy I mean for
[46:14] us to just count the if we were paying
[46:16] off the US's debt at $1 per second it
[46:19] would take you over a million years to
[46:21] pay back what we've what we've
[46:23] accumulated and it's going to only
[46:25] Accelerate from here it's going to be
[46:27] faster and faster and faster so I think
[46:29] once you kind of understand that math is
[46:32] approach approaching kind of break neck
[46:34] speed it's gonna fail it's it's not
[46:36] really a matter of if at any I mean it's
[46:39] just a matter of when and it's going to
[46:41] speed up from here so I think it's just
[46:44] prudent to understand that that's the
[46:46] reality understand that you don't have a
[46:48] political solution to walking back that
[46:50] problem and then just be like okay given
[46:52] that mathematical reality what do you do
[46:55] what are you going to do to protect
[46:56] yourself and luckily we've been given
[46:58] this tool by Satoshi that you can
[47:01] protect yourself and put your productive
[47:03] capacity in an unconfiscatable place so
[47:06] you know that Bitcoin can't be printed
[47:08] you know that dollars are going to be
[47:09] printed at an accelerated rate so it's
[47:11] really just a matter of just choosing
[47:13] one over the other and once you kind of
[47:15] mathematically understand the
[47:16] underpinnings of those two realities
[47:19] it's just a I mean to me it's a no
[47:20] Briner conversation and I think everyone
[47:22] eventually is going to see it um I I
[47:26] mean I think there's a long way for us
[47:27] to go we can feel like there's too many
[47:30] Bitcoin podcasts because we're immersed
[47:32] in this world but think about when you
[47:34] go out in the street or you go out to a
[47:36] party with your friends or you go to the
[47:38] movies like how many of your circle even
[47:41] really understands Bitcoin and you
[47:43] realize how early we are and it really
[47:45] does we're we're needed like I mean I I
[47:48] agree with you that Bitcoin does not
[47:49] need us in the grand scheme of things
[47:51] but everybody in your life that you care
[47:54] about they are going to need a solution
[47:56] to the this deep basement tsunami that's
[47:58] coming at them and you can be that point
[48:00] of light and anyone that realizes just
[48:03] how few of their friends and family
[48:05] could actually talk to you about Bitcoin
[48:07] for 10 minutes in a very educated Way
[48:10] shows you how early we are so it's like
[48:12] we need to tell as many people as
[48:14] possible because that math is Relentless
[48:16] that math is not going to wait for you
[48:18] that math is going to destroy everybody
[48:21] moving forward over the next few decades
[48:23] so you need to tell the people you care
[48:25] about because it's it's gonna happen
[48:28] faster than people realize it's gonna
[48:30] happen at an accelerated rate and you
[48:32] need to do something about it like
[48:36] yesterday yeah that's a big thing like
[48:38] uh if we orange billing we're not
[48:40] pushing Bitcoin we are helping our loved
[48:43] ones yeah this is what what people don't
[48:46] get like we I never uh want to Orange
[48:49] build anyone that's not ready uh because
[48:52] then they're just getting upset and
[48:54] they're like they they have this this
[48:56] resistance things so I'm just like I'm
[48:58] I'm the Bitcoin guy everywhere where I
[49:01] go uh because except Bitcoin conferences
[49:03] and Bitcoin meetups but have those
[49:06] bubbles I'm the Bitcoin guy because I'm
[49:08] really loud on social media about it and
[49:10] also in my family but now I'm like a
[49:12] little bit uh defense about it and I
[49:15] noticed people come to me people like if
[49:18] they're actually interested they're like
[49:21] uh writing me a message hey how is it
[49:23] where should I buy or they calling me
[49:25] hey uh I want to learn more about this
[49:27] Bitcoin thing I'm struggling with
[49:29] inflation stuff like that so one by one
[49:32] small and small they come uh but you're
[49:35] right when I sit down and my and I have
[49:37] a big family like we have like I don't
[49:40] know if we come all together to one fast
[49:42] is like 50 60 people or something like
[49:45] that from the close family really really
[49:47] big family and there are probably
[49:51] there's and there's one guy I can talk
[49:54] with him about Bitcoin and uh pretty
[49:58] long educ on educated level and then
[50:00] there are few that have Bitcoin uh if I
[50:03] talk more than five minutes and go
[50:05] deeper they will not understand
[50:08] anything just on Basics level like not
[50:11] not not like and then uh but it's it's
[50:16] getting better like when I started in
[50:17] 2020 there was just me and now this
[50:20] small steps he has some Bitcoin he
[50:24] understands it a little bit better he
[50:25] went really deep
[50:27] uh so it's it's get better and better
[50:29] and it's like a measurement of mine also
[50:31] like of my big family how many people
[50:33] get it on every time Christmas every
[50:35] time Eastern like oh how was it last
[50:37] year it's it's it's gets better and
[50:40] better um but we all kind of agree on on
[50:43] feat will go to zero or close to zero
[50:46] depending on how long you look out uh do
[50:49] you also expect all out coins to go to
[50:53] zero I mean that's a good question I
[50:55] actually get that question a lot and
[50:56] it's it's it's not as often as it was
[50:59] kind of in the beginning when I started
[51:00] my podcast I feel like you could almost
[51:02] always count of like well what about the
[51:04] other coins or what's special about
[51:05] Bitcoin compared to the other coins like
[51:07] that was a very common question I feel
[51:09] like in some ways Bitcoin is winning
[51:11] that Evolution to the point that I get
[51:13] that question less and less and less you
[51:15] know and it's like it's in some ways
[51:16] it's easier because it's like well you
[51:18] know there's a reason that there's
[51:21] Bitcoin ETFs and there's not dog with
[51:23] hat ETFs and there's a reason that like
[51:25] political candid are talking about
[51:27] Bitcoin and they're not talking about
[51:29] Pepe coin or Dogecoin or whatever so I
[51:32] feel like I don't have to explain that
[51:33] as often as I used to it seems like it's
[51:37] people are kind of understanding even if
[51:38] they don't can't speak to it directly
[51:41] they have enough kind of a tangential
[51:43] information coming in that they they
[51:45] realize Bitcoin is different there's
[51:46] something about Bitcoin that's different
[51:48] than the rest I'm a I'm not as maybe
[51:50] Maxi about it as some where I I realize
[51:53] why we do it like just say hey do not
[51:55] touch any of these coins because that's
[51:58] the safest thing to do like because a
[52:00] lot of them are scams I'm I'm a little
[52:03] reluctant to Broad brush every single
[52:05] coin there's like 20s something thousand
[52:07] of them I mean I don't know enough about
[52:09] any one project to know if it's going to
[52:11] be interesting or not what I do know is
[52:13] none of them solve the problem of money
[52:16] they don't solve the problem of broken
[52:18] money which is why I came to Bitcoin in
[52:20] the first place so like I'm not really
[52:22] concerned with what they're trying to do
[52:23] I'm not really concerned with whether
[52:26] they're good investment because for me
[52:28] Bitcoin yeah it's an investment but it's
[52:30] really an investment in the future of
[52:31] human Freedom it's not really an
[52:32] investment from a monetary perspective
[52:35] primarily for me so I'm principally
[52:37] involved in it so what I like to just
[52:40] tell anybody about any of the other
[52:41] coins is uh right now we're sitting here
[52:44] we're having this conversation about
[52:45] Bitcoin we could talk about it for uh I
[52:48] don't an hour and change whatever this
[52:50] ends up going and we also know that when
[52:52] we hit stop on this we could talk about
[52:54] it for another five hours and explain
[52:56] exactly what it's doing what it could do
[52:58] why it's interesting why it's special so
[53:01] I tell anybody if you can do that for
[53:04] you know dog with hat like if you're
[53:06] capable of sitting down and talking
[53:08] about dog with hat for 30 minutes
[53:10] explaining its use case explaining what
[53:12] it's actually accomplishing explaining
[53:14] why it's important um then then maybe
[53:18] you should invest in it I don't know I
[53:19] just don't think anyone really
[53:21] understand like they're just gambling on
[53:23] something it's like um I like to think
[53:26] of like people talk about Bitcoin in the
[53:28] context of like the greater fool theory
[53:29] about how oh they just say it's a Ponzi
[53:32] scheme you're just looking to unload it
[53:33] on somebody and that's not true for
[53:35] Bitcoin I think like the the greater
[53:37] fool theory for Bitcoin is to find
[53:39] someone that'll sell it to you not
[53:41] understanding that it's absolutely
[53:42] scarce not understanding that it's gonna
[53:44] be like an internal battery for monetary
[53:46] energy for human the human race but when
[53:48] it comes to those other things like that
[53:50] is a greater fool Theory they're not
[53:51] they have no real I mean and and again
[53:54] not to Broad brush them all but the ones
[53:55] I mentioned
[53:57] they're not absolutely scarce they do
[53:59] not solve a problem they do not have a
[54:01] use case they're not going to protect
[54:02] you from monetary debasement so it's
[54:06] it's just a matter of um it's confusing
[54:09] because everyone kind of uh there's
[54:10] there's like a unit bias that people
[54:12] come into this crypto space they see the
[54:15] bitcoin's at whatever you know tens of
[54:17] thousands of dollars Out Of Reach for
[54:19] them and then they're like okay well
[54:20] what about this what's the next Bitcoin
[54:22] or what could be the next Bitcoin and
[54:24] they're not they're they're thinking
[54:25] about that as if they're kind of
[54:27] companies or as if you're kind of
[54:28] betting Bing horses or something they
[54:30] don't understand that like you know you
[54:32] you could um you could absolutely copy
[54:35] the Bitcoin code 100 like there's
[54:38] there's there's copies of it that change
[54:40] a little bit like Dogecoin is just a
[54:41] copy of Bitcoin with a couple tweaks to
[54:43] it you could just copy it 100% you could
[54:46] copy Bitcoin 100% roll it out but you
[54:49] can't it's the the only version of
[54:51] digital scarcity is the first version of
[54:53] digital scarcity so you you could
[54:55] replicate it a, times and still only the
[54:57] original is the one that's absolutely
[54:59] actually scarce and everyone kind of
[55:01] that's a hard concept to wrap your head
[55:03] around but um you know I like I was like
[55:06] to point to like Dogecoin back in the
[55:07] day and I was like hey there's 21
[55:09] million Bitcoin there are 14 million
[55:11] Dogecoin mined every single day so yeah
[55:14] you might look at it be like oh hey it's
[55:16] only 0.003 cents or something if that
[55:18] could ever be a dollar I could be a
[55:20] billionaire but the um the tokenomics
[55:24] matters like for that to get to a dollar
[55:26] it would have to be larger than the GDP
[55:28] of the entire world so it's like do you
[55:30] really think that Dogecoin is going to
[55:31] become bigger than the GDP of the entire
[55:34] Earth probably not you probably just
[55:36] don't understand the math that's at play
[55:38] here so um yeah I don't know I mean any
[55:41] one of those things could do something
[55:43] interesting you know like I don't I
[55:45] don't claim to be an expert on every
[55:47] single coin I just spend all of my
[55:49] energy understanding why Bitcoin is
[55:52] special why it's interesting why it's
[55:53] Unique and why it solves a real problem
[55:55] that I could definitively tell every
[55:57] single person on Earth they're going to
[55:59] have it solves a problem for eight
[56:01] billion people they all need a place to
[56:03] put their money that will not be
[56:05] confiscated and will not be debased and
[56:07] as far as what all the other ones are
[56:09] doing I don't really care because
[56:10] they're not doing
[56:12] that 100% it's like I think uh the
[56:16] difference between Bitcoin and all the
[56:18] altcoins uh is actually getting more and
[56:21] more clear and more and more people get
[56:23] it it's still when they look at coin
[56:26] market cap it's like Bitcoin and
[56:27] ethereum like that it's it's still
[56:29] listed with all the other stuff which
[56:31] makes it complicated because people then
[56:33] obviously counted do the same thing uh
[56:37] but it gets better and better with time
[56:39] I I I remember when I came into the
[56:42] space how hard for me it was to dis uh
[56:46] to to understand why is Bitcoin so much
[56:51] worth and why other things so much worth
[56:54] uh and it gets better and better and
[56:56] it's also like how many Bitcoin only
[56:59] podcasts were there like five years ago
[57:01] I don't know how many but probably a lot
[57:03] less than now and now there's like a lot
[57:06] of Bitcoin only podcasts there are
[57:07] Bitcoin only resources there are Bitcoin
[57:09] only uh people that only talk about that
[57:12] like educator social media influencers
[57:14] everything so uh the space evolved and
[57:17] it's really good uh but I I I often have
[57:21] this question like can these altcoins
[57:23] actually all go to zero I don't know as
[57:25] you said kind of on the same on the same
[57:27] page review here because there could be
[57:30] some utility like people are spending on
[57:33] some uh on some paintings that I don't
[57:37] see any value millions of dollars
[57:40] because they are like wow that's the
[57:42] it's such a great artist and I I don't
[57:45] understand that but just because I don't
[57:47] understand it how doesn't mean it has no
[57:50] value for anyone else so it's like uh
[57:53] the same thing here and before we end up
[57:55] the podcast the end rtin uh what what
[57:57] are you currently uh most excited about
[58:00] what what's the what's the current Topic
[58:02] in Bitcoin you're studying what's the or
[58:05] it doesn't even have to be about Bitcoin
[58:06] what's your what are you spending time
[58:09] learning about right now yeah if only we
[58:11] spend time doing anything else right uh
[58:13] yeah I I would think I think what's most
[58:15] interesting to me is being kind of
[58:17] honest about um how Bitcoin will will
[58:20] scale like and I do I have all the faith
[58:23] in the world that it's going to scale
[58:24] but I think when we're when we're honest
[58:26] about it we kind of look at something
[58:27] like lightning it's it's working great
[58:29] for now but we can see the future in a
[58:31] higher fee environment we're opening
[58:33] closing channels on that base layer is
[58:35] going to present a challenge it's going
[58:37] to be difficult I think we're doing a
[58:38] good job about being honest about that
[58:40] problem and trying to get ahead of that
[58:42] problem and kind of like looking at all
[58:44] these different scaling Solutions and
[58:45] things like that um but that's where I
[58:47] kind of spend most of my um time I think
[58:50] sometimes I know on my podcast or any
[58:52] kind of feedback I'll get is sometimes
[58:54] people kind of think that we're just
[58:56] kind of cheerleading for Bitcoin and we
[58:58] don't do a very good job about being
[58:59] maybe critical about like any of its
[59:01] shortcomings which maybe gives it this
[59:03] feel of uh that you're a snake oil
[59:05] salesman or that you're like you know
[59:07] really trying to sell a good or you're
[59:09] not like pointing out to any kind of
[59:10] like the actual um I wouldn't say
[59:13] shortcomings or deficiencies but maybe
[59:14] kind of challenges moving forward if
[59:16] it's really going to come to be a
[59:18] monetary base that the entire global
[59:20] economy can be built on we need to be uh
[59:23] realistic about what uh the potential
[59:25] challenge are um I'm not a coder myself
[59:29] but I do have absolute faith in the you
[59:31] know the nerd Army and I say that the
[59:33] most like endearing way because I think
[59:34] nerds make the entire world go round so
[59:37] I think there's the fact that Bitcoin is
[59:39] an open protocol we know it solves for
[59:42] money and then when it comes to scaling
[59:44] on top of it anybody can bring their
[59:47] ideas to the table anybody can bring
[59:49] their design ideas to the table anybody
[59:51] can build on top of it and I think that
[59:54] unleashing that level of ingenuity where
[59:56] you're not just counting on a single
[59:58] company or a single entity to solve a
[60:00] problem but you're just counting on the
[60:01] collective Innovation and Ingenuity of
[60:04] the entire human race building on an
[60:06] open source protocol I I have no doubt
[60:09] that those Solutions are going to come
[60:12] and I like to think about this in a way
[60:14] that we we have time because um you know
[60:17] when when you think of just kind of the
[60:19] three broad buckets of money you got it
[60:21] needs to be a store value a medium
[60:22] exchange and a unit of account we talk
[60:24] about that a lot um but it's always you
[60:27] kind of get confused between the two
[60:29] because it's like well um you know I
[60:31] can't I can't spend it anywhere or I
[60:33] still see it on TV I like Charlie
[60:35] gasperino talking about like well I
[60:36] can't buy pizza with it or something so
[60:38] they don't seem to understand that these
[60:40] like these phases of monetary adoption
[60:42] are connected in series they're not
[60:43] connected in parallel so it's going to
[60:45] have to be a store of value first and
[60:47] it's G to have to be a store of value
[60:48] that takes away the eight symmetric
[60:49] upside where all of the world's people
[60:52] kind of get it to this high water
[60:54] equilibrium point as a store of value to
[60:56] the point that gresham's law no longer
[60:59] is forcing it out of circulation and
[61:01] then you're going to need Payment
[61:02] Solutions so we have time I guess is the
[61:05] point is we have time to build out the
[61:07] payment Solutions because the store of
[61:09] value phase of this monetary adoption
[61:12] still has so much to like so much room
[61:14] to run so I think what's interesting is
[61:18] looking at like we talked about all
[61:20] those other coins I think that's almost
[61:21] like a research and development lab for
[61:24] what is an interesting use use case
[61:26] that's going to be built on top of
[61:27] Bitcoin and layers you already see that
[61:29] kind of happening with bit VM and tap
[61:31] rot assets and all these kinds of ideas
[61:33] coming from that world maybe and was
[61:35] like oh hey that that'd be nice if we
[61:37] could do that in the Bitcoin ecosystem
[61:38] it'd be nice if we could do that in the
[61:39] B Bitcoin ecosystem and building on top
[61:42] in layers but I think that's kind of the
[61:44] most um exciting thing besides just the
[61:48] like where we started with the game
[61:49] theory of unlocking all these kind of
[61:51] new players um so that's that that's
[61:55] something I'm more just
[61:56] observing is one what are the scaling
[61:59] Solutions and what are all these kind of
[62:00] unlocking Innovative Minds going to
[62:02] bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem moving
[62:03] forward and then two how hard is this
[62:06] thing about to push who's going to start
[62:08] paying attention and uh you know like
[62:10] you I want I want that nation state Game
[62:13] Theory Game theoretical adoption to
[62:16] catch this because once we get to that
[62:18] point I think uh you're you're all the
[62:20] way over you're all the way over that
[62:22] Rubicon Edge that there's no there's no
[62:24] getting this back under control you just
[62:26] need a couple of those big players to go
[62:28] and then everybody has to
[62:29] go yeah definitely and I love the fact
[62:32] that you uh the the line you said about
[62:35] the altcoins being a test net and and
[62:37] experiment lab for for Bitcoin because I
[62:40] also see it like that that uh altcoins
[62:42] can be really good to experiment stuff
[62:44] and we can also look at all the altcoins
[62:47] see like oh this could be actually
[62:49] something that could be as a scaling
[62:50] Solution on Layer Two fre on top of
[62:52] Bitcoin uh something really interesting
[62:55] um we have Andrew Andrew in the podcast
[62:57] where the previous guest is asking a
[62:59] question for the next guest uh which is
[63:01] also really interesting because he does
[63:02] not know who is the next guest actually
[63:05] yeah um and the question for you is how
[63:07] do you handle the noise in the bull
[63:09] market and this question was targeted uh
[63:13] because in the bare market and he said
[63:15] like he likes the bare markets more
[63:17] because then there only the true
[63:19] bitcoiners there and this this this uh I
[63:22] don't know if you've seen this guy who
[63:24] says like the Haring is like when 21
[63:26] million Bitcoin are half in in the half
[63:28] quantity but sure there there are really
[63:31] interesting guys and guys and girls
[63:33] coming up in these bull markets and a
[63:35] lot of noises coming up in in the bull
[63:37] market how do you handle
[63:40] that uh I mean yeah I've already I'm
[63:42] already seeing that I agree with that it
[63:44] is difficult I think um I think the way
[63:46] I handle it is uh just like I said the
[63:49] reason I started my podcast in the first
[63:51] place was to never forget that when you
[63:53] first came to bitcoin you didn't know
[63:55]  either you know so it's like never
[63:57] forget that you also didn't know what
[63:59] the hell was going on you came with all
[64:02] the same dumbass questions that
[64:04] everyone's gonna start coming with now
[64:06] and I think um I always took this lesson
[64:08] away I would bring it up sometimes I was
[64:09] like a volunteer firefighter for a while
[64:11] and it was uh it was always clear which
[64:14] which guys remembered that they didn't
[64:16] like they weren't God's Gift of
[64:17] firefighting when they came out of the
[64:19] womb and that they were willing to kind
[64:21] of take a new guy under his wing and
[64:22] teach him the ways and get like bring
[64:25] him up to spe speed on where he needs to
[64:26] be and the guys that kind of forgot
[64:28] where they came from and just got really
[64:30] crusty about stuff and just called you
[64:31] an idiot because you didn't know how to
[64:32] do something you would never taught how
[64:34] to do so I think I take the same
[64:36] approach to the Bitcoin bull market as
[64:39] that where inevitably people are coming
[64:41] in there's they're trying to sift
[64:43] through the same information you were
[64:45] sifting through in the beginning they're
[64:46] looking for the same answers you were
[64:48] looking for in the beginning and you
[64:50] could provide them a little bit of a
[64:51] shortcut by being willing to know that
[64:54] they don't know and being willing to
[64:56] meet them where they're at and being
[64:57] willing to have the patience because if
[64:59] we really want this to be money for
[65:01] Humanity we want everybody to come over
[65:03] so it doesn't really do us much good if
[65:05] we're trying to build a Network
[65:06] Technology to kind of shun people out of
[65:09] the network so I just think it's our
[65:11] responsibility to just because we came a
[65:13] few years earlier it's our
[65:15] responsibility to pass that knowledge
[65:17] forward and take on the responsibility
[65:19] of turning on some more nodes on this
[65:20] network and getting more people plugged
[65:22] in so I think it's just a matter of
[65:25] expect
[65:26] like kind of really stupid questions to
[65:28] be asked and give people the room to ask
[65:31] those in like a non-threatening way
[65:33] because if we just try to shut them up
[65:34] or shut them down immediately that's
[65:37] really intimidating and like
[65:38] understanding Bitcoin and understanding
[65:40] money and understanding like the
[65:42] creature from Jackal Island and all this
[65:44] no it's intimidating to begin with and
[65:46] it's not going to do us any good if we
[65:47] just slam the door in people's faces so
[65:50] I think the way I kind of like deal with
[65:51] the noise of that bull market is really
[65:53] just to see it as an opportunity see it
[65:55] as an opportunity that if somebody's
[65:57] saying something that we know is kind of
[65:58] misguided to give them the opportunity
[66:00] to recorrect redirect and luckily we
[66:03] have the platform to do that right and
[66:05] we can say hey come on my podcast let's
[66:07] talk about it let's kind of help help
[66:09] get through this and kind of use it as a
[66:11] teaching moment as opposed to like
[66:13] trying to shut it down so that's that's
[66:15] how I see it I mean I get as annoyed as
[66:17] everybody else when you kind of have to
[66:19] reiterate on the exact same fud and the
[66:22] exact same you know accusations against
[66:24] Bitcoin over over and over and over
[66:26] again but I think that's just the
[66:29] reality of what's going on here you know
[66:31] we're adopting a brand new technology
[66:33] we're adopting a brand new technology in
[66:35] an arena of money that people don't have
[66:37] a good grasp on to begin with so it's
[66:40] just hard to get somebody caught up to
[66:42] speed within you know five minutes 10
[66:44] minutes it took us a lot of time it's
[66:46] going to take them a lot of time and
[66:48] just hopefully we can help it help
[66:50] condense the time frame from you know a
[66:52] thousand hours to 100 hours or something
[66:54] like that I'm just see it as an
[66:56] opportunity to
[66:59] teach amazing yeah is uh I love I love
[67:02] the way you you look at things and it's
[67:04] it's always clear when people get a lot
[67:06] in Bitcoin as you yourself get a lot in
[67:09] Bitcoin and you talk with a lot of
[67:10] Bitcoin on you clearly uh are deep in
[67:13] The Rabbit Hole uh I I just like uh it's
[67:16] it's you speak with someone one hour and
[67:17] you just see uh the the the the work
[67:21] they have done and the the things they
[67:23] have gone through like I think thank you
[67:25] for being on Michael I thank you for for
[67:27] being on on the podcast and and bringing
[67:29] your your inputs and your feedback uh to
[67:31] the show H for people that have now
[67:34] additional questions uh to you have like
[67:36] want to reach out to you where can they
[67:38] reach you where can they uh ask you
[67:41] questions uh yeah absolutely man so my
[67:43] uh my podcast is called the taking care
[67:45] of Bitcoin podcast I'm on Twitter at TC
[67:49] bcoin so you can reach out to me on
[67:51] Twitter at TCB coin and uh I'm always
[67:54] looking for new people to come on on my
[67:56] show so if anybody's either new
[67:58] themselves and is curious to get their
[67:59] questions answered or if they know
[68:01] anybody that would be a good fit for you
[68:04] know being willing willing to come on a
[68:06] podcast that's hard the hardest part
[68:08] sometimes is getting people to be
[68:09] willing to do it as new people so um
[68:11] yeah anybody that wants to come get
[68:12] their specific Bitcoin questions
[68:14] answered please reach out there and I'd
[68:16] love to have you uh on the show and uh
[68:18] yeah Robin thank you for having me on
[68:20] your show man I love what you're doing
