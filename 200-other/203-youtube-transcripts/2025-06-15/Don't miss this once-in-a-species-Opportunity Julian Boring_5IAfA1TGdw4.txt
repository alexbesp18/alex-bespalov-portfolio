[00:00] don't miss this opportunity it's the
[00:01] greatest opportunity it's once in a
[00:03] species lifetime opportunity was able to
[00:05] go ahead and dislodge myself from my
[00:08] previous employer and retired it doesn't
[00:10] stop from here on out it will be with me
[00:12] for the rest of my life Bitcoin as a as
[00:15] a means of trying to preserve their
[00:17] wealth or create their wealth because
[00:19] their country's currency is nothing you
[00:21] know it's just paper without risk there
[00:24] is no reward you're born you live and
[00:26] you die you Decay but does Bitcoin does
[00:28] the protocol decay information never
[00:31] really decays and I do everything I can
[00:34] to educate others close to me about
[00:36] Bitcoin we can just print money out of
[00:38] thin air how is that in any way shape or
[00:41] form any good for anyone be the voice of
[00:44] Bitcoin have you bought your Bitcoin
[00:47] today you told me that you were early
[00:50] retired because you were able to like
[00:55] save and invest and uh do all that stuff
[00:58] and you're now doing voiceover it's kind
[01:00] of obvious with your voice I think it's
[01:03] a very logical and good decision uh but
[01:06] before we get into this Bitcoin stuff
[01:08] and I think saving for early retirement
[01:11] is something very Bitcoin like uh but
[01:14] let's get into it like how did you save
[01:17] did you have like a savings rate did you
[01:19] have methods to do it did you had always
[01:21] this plan to like retire early and like
[01:23] this like oh I have this age and I want
[01:25] to retire I have to save this much how
[01:28] did you go ahead and do that
[01:30] well I I've been a um an employee of the
[01:34] government the local government for most
[01:37] of my adult life and um if you're
[01:40] working for a government entity
[01:42] particularly a county or city or even
[01:44] the federal government you do receive a
[01:45] pension after all of those years and you
[01:47] have an opportunity as well to invest in
[01:51] 401ks and 457s with your company and
[01:55] that's essentially what I did and a
[01:58] little bit later on several years years
[02:00] ago maybe four or five years ago um my
[02:03] wife and I we've bought some we bought a
[02:05] property and we were able to capitalize
[02:08] on the equity inside of that property
[02:10] during covid and we sold our property
[02:13] for considerable amount of money and we
[02:16] were able to take some of that money and
[02:19] reinvest it into
[02:20] Bitcoin and you know Bitcoin is is the
[02:24] best performing asset I've ever owned
[02:27] aside from Real Estate so up and until
[02:30] that time it you know it was planning
[02:32] for the retirement paying into the
[02:34] pension saving in the 401K and
[02:37] 457 in doing that and we're actually we
[02:40] both you know quote unquote Servants of
[02:43] the public government employees and my
[02:45] wife has pensions coming in and I do as
[02:48] well and so we were able to retire early
[02:52] because if you spend 30 years in a city
[02:55] you're you're going to be able to retire
[02:56] with a sizable pension and that's kind
[02:58] of how it just works and so turned 55
[03:01] retired we moved sold our home bought
[03:05] another home and invested the rest of it
[03:07] into
[03:08] Bitcoin and it's just simply been the
[03:10] best performing asset that we have and
[03:13] aside from that when I was able to go
[03:16] ahead and dislodge myself from my
[03:19] previous employer and retired I was able
[03:21] to take over those funds in my 457 and I
[03:24] in turn bought ibit on the day of launch
[03:28] that's done very well as well so any way
[03:32] I can capture Bitcoin I will capture
[03:34] Bitcoin so I wasn't able to exit those
[03:36] funds without paying tax consequences on
[03:39] them so those will just continue to grow
[03:41] inside of that 457 till now until I
[03:44] decide to settle on that high bit yeah
[03:47] it's amazing and I think also like
[03:49] Pension funds it will like there are so
[03:51] many effects to it like the Pension
[03:53] funds and the ibid and the the ETFs on
[03:55] bitcoin side first of all will have a
[03:58] massive inflow to bitcoin
[04:00] but also enables people without getting
[04:03] the penalties to get exposure to bitcoin
[04:06] this is something really really great
[04:08] and for people now that are listening
[04:10] they maybe early in the game and they're
[04:13] wondering like now like and I think a
[04:16] lot of people still see Bitcoin as this
[04:19] like risky thing and I think actually it
[04:22] would be the best thing to have as seen
[04:25] as your pension as your savings
[04:27] technology um absolutely why do you see
[04:30] that as someone that retired actually
[04:32] early and are already in this stage
[04:34] where a lot of people want to go there
[04:36] for everybody that is like now under 50
[04:38] under 40 I want to get retire early why
[04:41] is Bitcoin uh the the number one
[04:45] choice well I think it goes without
[04:48] saying that it it still is the best
[04:50] performing asset really of all time and
[04:55] without risk there is no reward so the
[04:58] volatility is just natural for in my
[05:01] opinion a nent technology a nent
[05:04] asset and that I'm sure that over time
[05:07] the volatility will likely begin to
[05:09] decrease and and I think that's just the
[05:12] natural part of an asset establishing
[05:15] itself in the market again I'm no
[05:18] technical expert but just from being
[05:21] able to witness different kinds of
[05:24] investment funds and different kind of
[05:26] asset categories throughout my adult
[05:28] life and those investment opportunities
[05:30] with my employer there just simply
[05:32] hasn't been anything there hasn't been a
[05:33] company there hasn't been anything
[05:35] that's been able to produce the kind of
[05:37] return that that Bitcoin has so that in
[05:40] itself warrants and merits um everyone's
[05:44] attention to taking a look at that asset
[05:47] and determining if that fits you know
[05:50] their their investment Comfort level and
[05:52] and I just don't think that we're going
[05:56] and there's no Financial advice in this
[05:58] in this conversation with you it's it's
[06:00] all a personal choice but I can't
[06:02] imagine what else would come along and
[06:05] replace the perfect money the perfect
[06:07] asset the perfect return on investment
[06:10] that you're ever going to be able to get
[06:12] I think as as Meyers puts it uh it's a
[06:17] Once in a species opportunity to grow
[06:20] your generation of wealth once in a
[06:23] species opportunity my opinion he's
[06:25] absolutely correct we're never going to
[06:27] get this kind of opportunity again to
[06:29] own to hold to have the world's greatest
[06:33] monetary creation or
[06:36] Discovery yeah I just I'm fighting with
[06:39] a ladybug
[06:41] here it was shaking it off and it's
[06:45] coming to my head she's coming for your
[06:47] Bitcoin coming for my Bitcoin yeah and
[06:50] it's totally true what you're saying and
[06:52] it's something beautiful and I saw it
[06:54] also I think on your timeline on Twitter
[06:56] um and this is something um a lot of
[07:00] bitcoiners that are longer in the game
[07:02] are saying that Bitcoin is actually not
[07:04] a blockchain but a Time chain and when
[07:08] we are going down this rabbit hole that
[07:09] is Bitcoin is so much more than just
[07:13] money and it's some like this once in a
[07:15] species opportunity yes what does it
[07:17] mean for Bitcoin to be a time
[07:20] chain you know I I I really needed to
[07:24] understand Bitcoin more obviously I
[07:26] think we all do than rather just holding
[07:28] the asset
[07:30] and I began to to listen to the likes of
[07:33] Gigi dur Gigi and um because I just
[07:38] think he's one of the greatest Bitcoin
[07:39] Minds aside from obviously sailor and
[07:42] others but he I think he he takes
[07:45] Bitcoin and he breaks it down into some
[07:47] fundamentals because he's I believe he's
[07:49] a software engineer a coder and so I've
[07:53] learned a lot from him and and I can
[07:55] kind of go into basically how I idealize
[07:58] or understand Bitcoin and it may just be
[08:01] a regurgitation of the things that he
[08:03] said but it makes sense to me and it's
[08:06] why I decided to devote most of my time
[08:09] and quite frankly my Capital you know to
[08:11] bitcoin because at its core and I think
[08:15] people should understand what money is I
[08:19] think it's a fundamental part of
[08:20] learning Bitcoin and just having a you
[08:24] know a financial a financial literacy is
[08:27] that money is nothing but
[08:30] information and it is information about
[08:32] who owes what to whom and it's on a
[08:35] ledger or it's on a list or could could
[08:38] could even be a physical item that
[08:40] individuals traded way back when maybe
[08:43] it was shiny rocks it was Stones it was
[08:46] beads it was whatever it was salt and
[08:49] that was a medium of
[08:51] exchange and I think that Satoshi
[08:54] actually has
[08:55] created the purest form of money because
[08:58] again money is is
[09:00] information and what I mean by that is
[09:03] that the internet or our lines of
[09:06] communication channels we send
[09:09] information that's what we do
[09:11] information is the internet is in excuse
[09:14] me the internet is information and
[09:17] Satoshi created information in its
[09:20] purest form and then gave it all the
[09:22] necessary qualities to be the hardest
[09:24] form of money yeah it's also fascinating
[09:28] because we've for the first time ever we
[09:31] have a pure form of an asset of an
[09:35] blockchain of a Time chain whatever you
[09:37] want to call it that is not manipulated
[09:40] in the past correct yeah I think you all
[09:43] even read read like usually when I
[09:44] research about I guess I scroll a little
[09:46] bit through the Twitter and I saw
[09:48] something with like uh it took chaotic
[09:51] energy put it in blocks and ordered it
[09:54] in in in in a non forgeable style like
[09:57] you cannot go back and manipulate
[10:00] something which brings back
[10:02] accountability taking responsibility of
[10:05] your own Bitcoin uh which is something
[10:08] truly amazing in in my opinion yeah as
[10:11] because energy is the currency of the of
[10:14] the universe and we all have access to
[10:17] that energy and by by existing we we are
[10:20] energy and energy is what connects
[10:23] Bitcoin to the digital world and then
[10:26] the digital world to the real world and
[10:30] that's my opinion on on on that as far
[10:32] as energy is concerned it connects
[10:34] everything and we use proof of work as
[10:36] an energy source right if so in my
[10:40] opinion and probably many others and dur
[10:43] and such is that so Satoshi created a
[10:46] trustless digital decentralized currency
[10:49] and in order to do that he had to solve
[10:52] or she we assum me a he had to solve for
[10:54] the double spend problem right so Robin
[10:57] I I can't send you a Bitcoin and then
[10:59] within moments later send it to someone
[11:01] else right and so in order for that
[11:06] double spinned problem to be to finally
[11:10] be understood the challenge was to solve
[11:14] for it and and essentially double spin
[11:16] is nothing more than
[11:18] time so listening to Gigi and MERS and
[11:22] such and and and MERS did a great
[11:24] keynote presentation at Atlantis and he
[11:27] talked about the the physical Arrow of
[11:29] time right and the arrow of time within
[11:33] Bitcoin so proof of work obviously is
[11:37] what our computers do they harness
[11:39] physical energy power and they perform
[11:42] complex
[11:44] computations and through proof of work
[11:47] Satoshi linked the physical world to the
[11:49] digital world world and then gave us the
[11:51] Inception of the purest form of money
[11:53] which again is
[11:56] information and essentially Bitcoin is a
[11:58] timestamp Serv just like you mentioned
[12:00] right and it etches information history
[12:04] of events in time into
[12:07] blocks and those blocks are like clocks
[12:11] so every block is like the tick of a
[12:13] clock and each block contains
[12:16] information about an event that
[12:19] occurred and the computations that are
[12:21] solved for are random and
[12:25] complex in the randomness of that
[12:30] computation provides for the
[12:33] immutability of the blockchain
[12:35] randomness conceptually happens
[12:37] naturally in
[12:38] nature the arrow of time is nothing more
[12:42] than we know what the past is and we do
[12:44] not know what the future it is uncertain
[12:46] is unique and is random right so when
[12:50] solving go ahead is is um when when you
[12:55] talk about Bitcoin being a Tim stamp
[12:58] server being a time chain uh do you also
[13:01] believe that at some point Bitcoin could
[13:03] actually be a measurement of time as we
[13:06] now use our usual calendar and time
[13:10] things with with like yeah 2 p.m and
[13:12] stuff like that it's possible
[13:14] considering that I consider it and many
[13:16] others consider it to be time on the
[13:20] internet the source of
[13:22] time it is the time chain of Bitcoin and
[13:25] therefore it is time on the internet
[13:27] since the since the internet doesn't
[13:28] under understand time Satoshi gave it
[13:32] time he created time and then
[13:34] essentially he had to slow the time down
[13:36] in order to make it a
[13:39] decentralized uh consensus protocol
[13:43] slowing the time down gave us all an
[13:46] opportunity to come to consensus and
[13:49] validate those
[13:51] transactions so it's kind of like the
[13:53] creation of time and slowing the time
[13:54] down and that's what MERS tried to
[13:56] describe and it's kind of hard to wrap
[13:58] your head around it but it does make
[14:00] sense when you when you think of the
[14:03] arrow of time
[14:04] physically one of the things that is
[14:07] interesting to me about the physical
[14:09] form of the arrow at time that I don't
[14:11] think that we've we fully understand in
[14:14] Bitcoin yet and that is through the
[14:16] arrow of time things
[14:19] Decay you're born you live and you die
[14:23] you Decay we build structures there are
[14:26] mountains they erode the blocks and the
[14:29] stones that we build the structures out
[14:30] of over time
[14:33] Decay but does Bitcoin does the protocol
[14:37] Decay information never really
[14:40] decays right so I think that it could be
[14:43] an antithesis to the arrow of time the
[14:46] physical understanding of the arrow of
[14:48] time as we've enter into the digital
[14:50] Arrow of time maybe there is no Decay I
[14:53] don't think we figured that out yet I
[14:55] know I have't I'm not that
[14:58] smart
[14:59] so then there is also like so many like
[15:03] for me it's totally clear that the
[15:05] Bitcoin will be uh the main asset for
[15:09] the
[15:09] Earth and there's a lot of discussion
[15:12] also like can it be on other planets too
[15:14] what is the synchronization going
[15:16] through and I'm I'm as you said I'm not
[15:19] an expert enough and I'm not well
[15:21] educated to to make those judgment I
[15:23] think it could be possible I think uh
[15:26] there are really smart people that can
[15:27] find Solutions also for that right um
[15:30] but if we scientist which I am not so
[15:33] you know I just kind of I kind of
[15:36] hypothesize in my Layman's mind and kind
[15:39] of postulate on some of those things in
[15:41] the future I know I won't be here to see
[15:44] them through but um because the the
[15:48] proof of work is used in the process uh
[15:52] and on the protocol that is what
[15:54] differentiates it from any of the other
[15:57] of crypto that exist out there um
[16:00] because the proof of work is what
[16:02] actually the energy
[16:04] used to do the computations the energy
[16:08] used in the proof of work actually
[16:10] protects the protocol it protects the
[16:14] information it becomes embedded inside
[16:17] of the block and it becomes part of that
[16:21] block and becomes part of the block the
[16:24] time chain got to get used to not saying
[16:26] the blockchain but becomes part of the
[16:28] time chain chain which then protects
[16:31] that information the history of events
[16:32] and becomes therefore becomes
[16:35] immutable cannot be Rewritten yeah for
[16:38] me it's always interesting because
[16:40] different people hold Bitcoin for for
[16:43] different reasons and especially people
[16:46] get in for different reasons there are
[16:48] people that just go in because oh number
[16:50] go up technology I think those are the
[16:52] most people get in because of that or
[16:54] are getting interested in that there
[16:56] also people that got in actually because
[16:58] of the te techology like because they
[17:00] are nerds and they're like oh let's play
[17:02] around with Bitcoin let's play around
[17:03] with blockchain those are less people um
[17:07] what was the reason for you like wh why
[17:09] did you get into Bitcoin in the first
[17:11] place and you also shared with me um
[17:14] beforehand that you had two brain
[17:17] surgeries that you
[17:18] had health issues how did this all like
[17:22] this was probably before you discovered
[17:25] Bitcoin um so let's let's maybe let's go
[17:28] before that like how did um maybe the
[17:32] brain surgeries and I think people that
[17:35] have something serious with health
[17:38] usually have an way healthier way to
[17:42] think about life right that's absolutely
[17:45] correct you're you're forced to
[17:47] appreciate and be humbled by your
[17:49] existence and the and the things and the
[17:51] people you love around you so yeah it
[17:54] wasn't very long ago actually that I uh
[17:57] ended ended up having to have have two
[17:59] brain
[18:01] surgeries and there was a there was
[18:03] reasons behind that but the health
[18:05] reasons behind that is that um my
[18:08] balance and hearing were were completely
[18:11] just almost
[18:13] destroyed and the brain surgeries I had
[18:16] to actually fly out to a brain lab in
[18:20] California to have it done some
[18:21] Specialists and and it was on each side
[18:25] of my brain since then you know the the
[18:28] reasons I went in for have have have
[18:31] become um completely
[18:34] corrected however I do have some balance
[18:37] issues and I'm left with a small amount
[18:39] of brain damage as a result of that so
[18:43] that Journey actually sent me down you
[18:48] know the blockchain path I was scared
[18:52] and to this day I'm still frightened of
[18:55] of losing some memory of of losing the
[18:59] ability to function cognitively I do see
[19:03] some declines in me as a result but I
[19:05] still think that my muscle memor is
[19:07] intact for the most part and that L like
[19:10] I said that led me down the Avenue of
[19:14] how do I keep my brain active and alive
[19:16] and interested in some in stuff because
[19:17] it was the only thing that interested me
[19:20] you know to go down this Rabbit Hole now
[19:24] I started out in crypto just mostly like
[19:28] you know like other bitcoiners I got
[19:30] wrecked I learned and I'll never do that
[19:34] again Bitcoin essentially saved me from
[19:37] that and I I did everything I needed to
[19:40] learn and understand the scope of
[19:42] Bitcoin the best that I could and it it
[19:46] gave
[19:47] me the the wherewithal to get through
[19:51] some of the things that I needed to get
[19:52] through personally it gave me gave me
[19:55] something to look forward to research
[19:57] study you know the things that have
[20:00] always interested me are you know all
[20:04] kinds of things technical I've done a
[20:05] little programming my time but I'm
[20:07] certainly no
[20:08] programmer but it kept me it kept my
[20:11] mental memory and and and it kep it kept
[20:15] me cognitively cognitively astute I do
[20:18] have some difficulty talking sometimes
[20:20] but that's just a part of being what it
[20:22] is and I and I don't know that I
[20:24] mentioned that also gave me seizures and
[20:26] epilepsy as well so there there are some
[20:28] things that I just struggle with and um
[20:31] and bitcoin's my outlet and it's
[20:34] certainly you know the greatest thing
[20:36] ever invented so why not why not enjoy
[20:39] researches and studying the greatest
[20:41] thing ever invented for mankind you know
[20:44] and discovered so and I think it's the
[20:48] it's it's still amazing what we have as
[20:52] a pleasure to have like it's we have the
[20:56] pleasure being alive in this time when
[21:00] money is being
[21:01] revolutionized completely completely and
[21:05] it's like the internet itself is great
[21:08] and then on top of that there's Bitcoin
[21:10] that Revolution is the whole money thing
[21:13] and I I think two or three guests ago I
[21:17] had guys guys SW on and we actually
[21:19] talked about which Revolution is bigger
[21:22] the internet itself or Bitcoin is
[21:25] Bitcoin built on top of of the internet
[21:27] or is it like separate stuff and uh we
[21:29] kind of landed on that Bitcoin is the
[21:31] bigger one and uh Bitcoin also does not
[21:35] need the Internet actually because you
[21:37] could act like it's not feasible but you
[21:40] could actually just write it down a
[21:42] piece of paper and do the whole thing
[21:44] prot it's just an idea um so that's
[21:48] amazing and what I'm now um questioning
[21:52] did all the things that happen in your
[21:54] life with with brain surges and and
[21:56] stuff like that influen how you then
[22:00] discovered Bitcoin and the way you think
[22:03] of Bitcoin obviously you you need a
[22:04] Bitcoin to um like get your brain going
[22:08] and it's something that interested you
[22:09] but how did it like maybe change a view
[22:12] on bitcoin that might be different to
[22:14] somebody
[22:15] else well I just flipped the switch
[22:18] right it it it made me take a deep dive
[22:21] into financial literacy and economics
[22:25] what I thought I knew I really didn't
[22:27] know and I think a lot of people will
[22:29] Express that what we thought we knew
[22:31] about the existing system or what we
[22:33] were programmed to know Bitcoin helped
[22:37] us understand what it can be and should
[22:40] be and so the you know the journey still
[22:43] continues to the day I I don't stop it's
[22:46] every single day it's Bitcoin hold
[22:49] on can you still hear me I can hear you
[22:53] okay so every single day I want to know
[22:56] and learn more about Bitcoin that
[22:59] doesn't change and I don't see that
[23:02] changing it's not as if the protocol
[23:05] itself is evolving it's I am evolving in
[23:09] understanding Bitcoin and how I can use
[23:12] it and how it relates to my life and
[23:15] what I will be doing it and how I will
[23:17] be sharing it with my family for years
[23:19] to come so I think everybody finds their
[23:22] own journey and their own
[23:24] reason and that just happened to be mine
[23:27] it was my step into the door the Bitcoin
[23:30] door it became the reason why I wanted
[23:33] to learn
[23:34] more is that is that some things
[23:37] happened in my life and I think that
[23:39] could be the case for others something
[23:42] prompts them right something in their
[23:44] life prompts them to go down the Bitcoin
[23:47] Rabbit Hole or at least begin to
[23:50] understand time chains and blockchains
[23:53] and everything involved in that that was
[23:56] mine it doesn't stop from here on out it
[23:59] will be with me for the rest of my life
[24:02] and I do everything I can to educate
[24:05] others close to me about Bitcoin I'm not
[24:09] giving them Financial ADI advice but I
[24:12] just encourage them take time to study
[24:15] it because when you do you're going to
[24:18] understand what money is and you're
[24:21] going to begin to understand that what
[24:23] you have learned all these years you
[24:24] will have to
[24:26] unlearn bitcoin forces you to do
[24:30] that how successful are you with
[24:33] educating others because I saw that it's
[24:36] actually not easy like it's it's it's
[24:39] easy to get people to like buy some
[24:43] Bitcoin like to convince them that it's
[24:46] a clever strategy to have some exposure
[24:50] to bitcoin I think this is getting an
[24:52] easy and easier sell but from having a
[24:56] little bit of Bitcoin it's a far way to
[25:00] being a
[25:02] bitcoiner adopting that manset to
[25:05] adopting like the the whole Revolution
[25:08] like one thing is nuk Gab technology but
[25:10] there are 20 more perspectives that you
[25:14] that needs to take to like Bitcoin um do
[25:16] you have like orange pilling stories or
[25:19] things well you know I think it it it
[25:22] depends on the person that you're
[25:23] talking
[25:24] to and um the amount of money they're
[25:27] interested to invest in if any at all
[25:31] and then it also depends
[25:33] on I think um where Bitcoin is in the
[25:37] market right is it are we in a bare
[25:39] Market are we in a bull market what
[25:41] cycle of the market are we in because at
[25:44] the end of the day for the most of
[25:46] everyone else around the planet
[25:48] everything is driven by the amount of
[25:50] money that either can spend or the
[25:52] amount of money they think they're going
[25:53] to get a return on their investment
[25:56] right and so often times in my you know
[25:59] in my experience it it really begins
[26:02] with trying to educate that person about
[26:05] money about Finance about the debasement
[26:09] of the currencies about Fiat about
[26:12] Federal Reserve just because as you
[26:14] probably know more people than not I
[26:17] mean more people more people do not know
[26:21] as much about Finance as they think they
[26:23] do we probably I know I didn't perhaps
[26:27] you did so it depends on the
[26:29] individual um if if Bitcoin is trading
[26:34] at
[26:34] $15,000 it's hard to try to convince
[26:38] someone that Bitcoin will likely be
[26:40] $100,000 one day you know it's it's
[26:43] almost impossible and impractical to try
[26:45] to do that so you have to kind of give
[26:48] them the basis for making that decision
[26:51] on the foundation and understanding of
[26:53] Fiat what it means what it doesn't mean
[26:56] the devaluation the debasement why why
[26:58] you're putting your money into this
[27:00] asset why it is the hardest asset known
[27:02] to man it's a lot to go into and
[27:05] sometimes I just don't have the patient
[27:07] patience for it just depends on the
[27:10] person if it's a family member that I
[27:13] know that could really benefit from
[27:16] something like this I just I just want
[27:18] them to understand and educate
[27:20] themselves and learn so I give them the
[27:23] material to read or I I show them the
[27:26] things they need to read and if if they
[27:28] have an interest then that's my door in
[27:30] if they don't I walk away and I have uh
[27:35] one amazing thing uh I don't know if I
[27:38] ever shared it on the podcast but I
[27:39] think uh the best way to orange pill
[27:42] someone is to have an amazing life
[27:45] yourself if people know that you are a
[27:48] bitcoiner like you have 100% being on a
[27:51] Bitcoin standard and they at the same
[27:54] time see oh he has happy family he
[27:57] does well in in the career he does good
[28:00] financially and he's just overall nice
[28:04] kind human being uh that gives back to
[28:07] the society contributes something is
[28:10] happy like all this good stuff if you if
[28:14] people see that they are listening to
[28:17] you they taking great point and and
[28:20] that's a great point and I remember one
[28:22] person I basically had to show them
[28:24] here's my return on investment I don't
[28:26] know where else you're going to find
[28:28] a better asset to put your money into
[28:31] it's not going to be apple it's not
[28:32] going to be Google you know I was here
[28:35] in the beginning of the internet I know
[28:38] I missed opportunities then Bitcoin
[28:40] wasn't around but I missed opportunities
[28:43] to invest in those burgeoning nent
[28:46] companies those technology companies
[28:49] miss that opportunity it is what it is
[28:51] trying to explain that to a younger
[28:53] person hey I missed this opportunity you
[28:56] might want to make sure you don't miss
[28:58] this one right and yes I may have be
[29:02] successful I may have retired early but
[29:04] I didn't do that on bitcoin per se I did
[29:07] that with other Investments during those
[29:09] times that those assets did well so now
[29:13] is the time for you to consider the
[29:16] opportunities that are before you that I
[29:18] once had that I didn't have then when it
[29:20] came to bitcoin but you have an
[29:22] opportunity now you're absolutely
[29:24] correct success can be a good thing and
[29:28] it can kind of be detrimental when you
[29:30] go on X and you see these individuals
[29:32] who do who do make a lot of money they
[29:35] have a lot of Bitcoin and sometimes I
[29:38] don't think they have the best interest
[29:39] of the community with some of the things
[29:42] that they recommend or say and that can
[29:45] be detrimental to someone who only can
[29:47] afford you know 01 Bitcoin and that is
[29:51] their life savings going into that this
[29:54] is a Global Currency so obviously there
[29:56] are people out there that have less than
[29:58] we do and more than we do so we need to
[30:00] be we need to be careful in my opinion
[30:03] and we need to be cautious about how we
[30:06] approach people because they may not
[30:07] have the kind of quote unquote wealth
[30:10] that we do or live the lifestyle we do
[30:14] do you speak of a specific example uh on
[30:17] the Internet or is it like uh just
[30:21] general um I I mean I think there's
[30:23] plenty I don't want to call anyone out I
[30:25] think there's plenty of examples but I
[30:27] think crypto
[30:29] is just the worst place where people are
[30:32] just scamming and rugging people
[30:35] relentlessly now we I don't see that as
[30:37] much in Bitcoin because the community
[30:40] calls that person out and they'll do it
[30:42] in a heartbeat you know or are Maxis or
[30:46] the Hornets will get out there and take
[30:47] control like like they should in those
[30:49] cases but crypto's just it's just
[30:52] terrible and to your point it crypto is
[30:55] to many people an easier end because it
[30:58] costs less to participate in those
[31:02] currencies or coins let's just call them
[31:04] tokens they aren't really currencies and
[31:07] people think well I can drop $1,000 doll
[31:09] and get a billion coins and it'll go to
[31:11] the Moon well obviously we all know
[31:14] through time and experience that's not
[31:16] the case it's typically the easier way
[31:18] in it drug me in in the beginning and I
[31:21] had to fight my way out of it got
[31:23] wrecked along the way and learned my
[31:26] lesson and I'm I'm I'm happy to have
[31:29] learned that lesson it taught me
[31:31] well but I wish I had just gone into
[31:35] Bitcoin first 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[31:38] from day one and they teach and preach
[31:41] self- custody this is my goto exchange
[31:45] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[31:47] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[31:49] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[31:52] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[31:55] this podcast use code Robin and click
[31:58] the link in the description yeah and I
[32:00] think this is something I hope at some
[32:03] point we get through this thing that not
[32:06] every bitcoiner has to go through a
[32:08] shitcoin phase and get
[32:09] wrecked right it would be wonderful if
[32:12] we could just get rid of shitcoins the
[32:14] world would be a better place I mean for
[32:17] me personally I never had a really
[32:19] shitcoin face I lost a lot of Bitcoin
[32:21] along the way with yeah I lost Bitcoin
[32:25] with Celsius I lost Bitcoin with other
[32:27] stuff a lost with so many weird stuffs
[32:30] uh and I'm I could probably have like
[32:33] three times the amount that I have now
[32:36] uh but I'm still super grateful uh that
[32:39] I just got Bitcoin right now even like
[32:42] if if I just uh started accumulating
[32:45] Bitcoin even yesterday I would be super
[32:48] happy a super early place to be in and
[32:52] which the the thing I wanted to point
[32:54] out earlier also was um when you said
[32:58] you missed out on the opportunity to
[32:59] invest in the internet that's basically
[33:02] all built on the tcpip protocol right uh
[33:06] and the thing that I try to get people
[33:10] to know is when you have when imagine
[33:15] all the value of Facebook Apple Google
[33:17] and Co are all going back to the main
[33:21] layer the dcpip protocol and then
[33:24] imagine you're being in 1995 and you
[33:27] could IM uh you can invest in this tcpip
[33:31] protocol token and you profit and you
[33:35] basically get all the financial energy
[33:38] gained from Facebook from Google from
[33:41] Apple everything that's that's
[33:45] Bitcoin correct
[33:47] absolutely that's absolutely correct um
[33:51] you know there I was younger when when
[33:55] the internet came about and I used it to
[33:58] the fullest uh extent that I could not
[34:01] really understanding its value right and
[34:07] I see that in perhaps younger people
[34:10] they fully don't understand the value of
[34:12] Bitcoin yet maybe it is a level of
[34:15] maturity who knows I think that as we
[34:19] age we we be I hope we come become more
[34:22] mature you know as we age but I some of
[34:25] some of uh younger people are far more
[34:28] advanced in maturity than than many
[34:30] others and particularly me Ina you know
[34:32] in many cases and are already into
[34:35] Bitcoin it just wasn't something that I
[34:38] understood at a younger age so you know
[34:42] missing it is is missing the opportunity
[34:45] to make money that's that's what that
[34:47] meant at the time because it it's not it
[34:50] certainly is not the
[34:52] protocol and it is not the money that
[34:54] Bitcoin is today it didn't have those
[34:57] qual ities and never will have those
[34:59] qualities never did and or won't so I
[35:02] didn't miss anything except an
[35:04] opportunity to make money you know to
[35:06] take my Capital not Capital that I had
[35:09] at work and that they were investing for
[35:11] me but able to put my money into that I
[35:15] used it to the full fullest extent you
[35:17] know and I even you know created web
[35:21] pages back in the day on HTML and I got
[35:23] in the chat rooms and did all that when
[35:26] then I had the dial up 56k BPS and if
[35:29] somebody called on the phone you got
[35:31] disconnected was way back you know so
[35:33] this is and then there was a time where
[35:35] there wasn't the internet
[35:37] so you know again kind of like you
[35:39] talking about um orange pilling the
[35:43] average person it is about the successes
[35:46] you've made along the way but it's also
[35:48] about the mistakes that you've made
[35:50] along the way and being able to convey
[35:51] that to someone you know I think is is
[35:55] Paramount and getting them to understand
[35:57] stand you know just don't miss this
[36:00] opportunity it's the greatest
[36:02] opportunity it's once in a species
[36:04] lifetime opportunity generational world
[36:07] and and for um people to understand what
[36:10] opportunity is we also have to explain
[36:13] them um why is it a revolution in the
[36:17] first place like a lot of people still
[36:20] think oh it's fine the the the fat
[36:24] system yes we have inflation but it's
[36:27] okay
[36:28] um I get also bigger salary I don't know
[36:31] how it's in in your place but in Austria
[36:34] there's like something as called as an
[36:36] inflation
[36:37] balance U we have a really strong union
[36:41] so they are discussing with the work the
[36:44] the union is discussing with the
[36:45] companies an uh pay upgrade for every
[36:50] Bond basically uh and everyone that is
[36:53] on the lower limit of of of of pay uh
[36:56] gets then 10% more which just drives
[36:59] inflation even more but that's another
[37:01] topic right and they're like oh yes
[37:03] inflation is like 8% I got a 10% raise
[37:06] this year it's fine what they don't
[37:09] realize real inflation is way higher
[37:11] than that 8% whatever they given and
[37:15] what they also not uh understanding is
[37:18] like stealing is not good like inflation
[37:22] is theft as Jeff boo says and he's
[37:24] absolutely correct yeah 100% what what
[37:27] do you think is about the current
[37:29] Financial system like what's what's like
[37:31] your overall take what's wrong with it
[37:34] uh and and why Bitcoin is actually the
[37:36] whole fix for
[37:38] that well the current Fiat system is a
[37:42] Ponzi scheme you know Everyone likes to
[37:45] call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme but it is
[37:47] fundamentally just exactly what that is
[37:49] it's a Pon Ponzi scheme we can just
[37:53] print money out of thin air I mean how
[37:56] is that in any way shape or form Ever
[38:00] every good for any good for anyone it's
[38:03] complete and total debasement of of a
[38:07] fiat currency it doesn't matter what
[38:09] nation you're in and eventually it'll re
[38:12] it it'll reach hyperinflation status
[38:15] right I mean at some point you just
[38:17] can't print any more money I live in the
[38:19] US you know we're 31 33 trillion doar in
[38:23] debt we can't pay the bills but we keep
[38:26] raising our credit limit and we keep
[38:29] printing money Co propelled us into that
[38:33] $30 trillion category in fact the great
[38:37] financial crisis started it all where we
[38:40] injected money into companies that were
[38:42] and banks that were just too big to fail
[38:44] well some things need to
[38:47] fail by by way of the arrow of time and
[38:51] Decay you have got to fail some things
[38:53] have got to
[38:55] fail and
[38:58] Satoshi I mean he he literally created
[39:02] the purest form of money right and then
[39:04] he laid a currency or a purest form of
[39:07] protocol if you will uh of order of
[39:10] transactions and events and created time
[39:12] on the internet slowed that time down so
[39:15] we could come to consensus about those
[39:17] transactions and that history Rec
[39:19] recreated as a as a global economy and
[39:22] he laid the most scarcest hardest finite
[39:27] currency ever on top of
[39:30] it and because of this that information
[39:34] is now money and I think it's Gigi that
[39:37] says that the Bitcoin bitcoin's Bearer
[39:40] instrument is information so the
[39:42] physicality of that is the data and the
[39:46] information itself inside of the block
[39:49] it goes back to the list is The Ledger
[39:52] and the money is the list and the list
[39:54] is the
[39:55] money and so if we need to create the
[39:59] most sound stable monetary policy that
[40:03] mankind has ever known then the existing
[40:07] systems are not
[40:08] that Bitcoin is they never will be that
[40:13] because they are man-made
[40:17] created and they what I mean by that is
[40:20] that there is there is government there
[40:22] is regulation there is something behind
[40:25] that money that makes it
[40:28] valuable to them so that the people of
[40:31] those nation states can use what they
[40:34] created for them where Bitcoin is what
[40:37] we created for
[40:40] ourselves and therefore it has more
[40:42] meaning and more value from a
[40:44] philosophical standpoint that's how I
[40:45] see Bitcoin it has the value because we
[40:49] attributed the value and no one controls
[40:52] the value therefore it cannot be a Ponzi
[40:55] scheme right because money is
[40:58] information
[41:00] we we we we have information that we
[41:05] that we carry out throughout everyday
[41:07] life we use a communication Channel we
[41:10] share information with each other and so
[41:14] if that's what it's meant by Design
[41:16] that's exactly what it is so there isn't
[41:19] a government out there that will ever
[41:21] create by Design governments can't
[41:23] create the almost o ideal money because
[41:26] it's a third party it's an intermediary
[41:28] someone controls the keys and the coins
[41:30] and obviously if you have humans
[41:34] involved in money well guess what's
[41:37] going to happen we know what's going to
[41:38] happen throughout
[41:39] time it it it's a complete and utter
[41:42] disaster nothing works it will always be
[41:46] corrupted it will always
[41:49] fail it's just going to happen that
[41:52] way with a
[41:54] protocol that is something something
[41:57] that is done via consensus via
[42:01] validation without an intermediary a
[42:05] controlling
[42:06] organism then that is the hardest finite
[42:09] scarcest form of money again ever known
[42:12] to man I challenge anyone to find
[42:15] something better I mean you bring it to
[42:18] me you know show me what's better if you
[42:22] can't then you know the conversation is
[42:25] over you know if you can't like sooshi
[42:27] says I don't have time to explain it to
[42:29] you if you don't take the time to
[42:31] understand it yourself and the value
[42:33] that it brings to humanity and the
[42:36] globe I I I'm not sure that we can
[42:39] continue the conversation because again
[42:41] you're missing out on the most important
[42:43] thing that's ever been created Satoshi
[42:46] must I I I can't even imagine the level
[42:48] of intellect that individual had I mean
[42:51] it it it we were graced with with that
[42:55] kind of intellect that gave us the
[42:58] purest form of money and I'm getting
[43:00] philosophical but it is actually just
[43:02] that we were we were we were given an
[43:06] opportunity right and for those of us
[43:09] that are taking that
[43:11] opportunity you know we we are we are
[43:14] probably a few out there few million out
[43:17] there that understands the necessity of
[43:21] this kind of currency and this monetary
[43:23] value and policy and unfortunately not
[43:25] everybody is there
[43:27] and every time we turn around there's a
[43:29] government that's trying to control it
[43:31] for us right I think the EU you can
[43:34] probably give me some some background on
[43:37] this but I was reading about this the
[43:38] other day how they're using their
[43:40] anti-money laundering uh laws that
[43:42] they're
[43:43] passing making I guess wallets in some
[43:47] cases illegal well that just tells you
[43:49] that Bitcoin is doing exactly what we
[43:52] want it to do it's they're fighting us
[43:55] right they're fighting what is going to
[43:58] be the the money of the of the universe
[44:02] eventually AI will probably use it we're
[44:05] not going to be around in a thousand
[44:06] years when when you know artificial
[44:08] intelligences are paying each other via
[44:10] Bitcoin because that's the baseler
[44:12] monetary system reserve currency of the
[44:15] universe but it will be that way one day
[44:18] so you're either here or you're
[44:20] not and hopefully you
[44:22] are yeah and it's it's fascinating I
[44:25] think what the U is doing is um they're
[44:30] they're trying to control this thing
[44:33] that they cannot control and they want
[44:35] to have in INF uh influence and
[44:38] monitoring everything they can so they
[44:42] are saying there is something like an
[44:44] unhost wallet just a fancy way of saying
[44:48] you have your own keys and this is only
[44:52] acceptable for transactions up to
[44:56] €3,000 uh I'm I'm not an expert on this
[45:00] topic I did not research deeply uh when
[45:02] will this implemented is it already
[45:04] implemented all this legal stuff because
[45:07] I actually don't care like if if the EU
[45:11] or Austria does something I don't agree
[45:13] with and I'll probably hear it really
[45:16] really soon uh because I'm really deep
[45:18] in the community I am prepared to move
[45:22] tomorrow right and the only thing uh um
[45:28] countries and and whatever is doing to
[45:31] when they are trying to ban or limit
[45:34] Bitcoin the only thing they can do is
[45:37] just Banning thems from Bitcoin it's
[45:40] kind of like what we talked about
[45:41] earlier it it's the fear of Bitcoin
[45:44] right I mean these these individuals I
[45:46] think not all of them but I'm sure there
[45:48] are plenty of people in the EU that
[45:51] understand what Bitcoin is capable
[45:53] capable of and what it is already doing
[45:56] so they fear that adoption you know they
[45:58] they they fear that their fiat currency
[46:00] will be worth nothing one day and quite
[46:02] frankly it is worth nothing and we yes
[46:04] one day it will fail and what is the
[46:07] stand in for that well obviously Bitcoin
[46:10] so I think it's what did they say they
[46:12] first they laugh at you I don't remember
[46:14] the exactly the the Cadence but first
[46:17] they laugh at you you know then X and
[46:20] then they then they fight you so we're I
[46:22] think we're at the fight you stage right
[46:24] and then they finally they finally
[46:27] accept yeah I think it's like first they
[46:30] ignore you then they laugh at you then
[46:33] they fight you and then they join you uh
[46:38] and uh we like we are weirdly in the
[46:42] fighting and joining stage like I feel
[46:44] like America uh is coming closer and
[46:47] closer to bitcoin with the Bitcoin ETF
[46:49] they are like President candidates are
[46:52] talking positively about Bitcoin um but
[46:55] they also the Elizabeth War and the
[46:57] Jamie diamonds of the world but these
[47:00] are I feel like they're getting
[47:03] really really not a lot of people in
[47:07] America talks really negative about it
[47:10] and the positive um voices also the
[47:14] powerful positive voices are getting
[47:15] more like like just Larry think it's
[47:19] massive to have him as say someone
[47:22] saying oh it's digital gold it's it's
[47:25] something like I don't know if he
[47:26] actually gets it or some just read some
[47:28] script uh but it actually does not
[47:30] matter
[47:31] because just the fact that he speaks so
[47:34] much about Bitcoin is good right even if
[47:37] he spoke bad about it uh but the fact
[47:40] that he speaks good about it contributes
[47:42] even more and yeah it's like we're in
[47:45] this weird stage where still fighting
[47:48] it's still like it's not uh totally
[47:51] legal everywhere there's limitations to
[47:53] it and there's taxes on it there's so
[47:55] much stuff with Bitcoin that will not be
[47:57] there in like 10 20 30 50 100 years I
[48:00] don't know the timeline um but this
[48:03] maybe actually interesting do we have
[48:05] like an an timeline in in your in your
[48:08] head like do you have like uh Fe
[48:10] currencies cannot survive longer than
[48:12] like X
[48:14] years I I don't know Robin I really
[48:16] don't I mean I'm surprised they've
[48:18] lasted this long and as evidence by just
[48:21] the trillions of dollars that the the US
[48:24] government is printing and um you know I
[48:26] don't I don't I don't know anything
[48:28] about European government in the sense
[48:30] of like executive judicial you know
[48:33] legislative branches but I I feel I feel
[48:37] confident in our government's judicial
[48:40] system if if anything our executive
[48:43] branches and our leg legislative
[48:45] branches fail us and try to pass laws
[48:48] that infringe upon our you know our
[48:50] first amendment rights I do feel that
[48:53] our judicial system will work and quite
[48:56] Frank is working in the American
[48:59] people's favor because if anybody holds
[49:02] the Constitution to its word the
[49:05] judicial system does right and so I'm I
[49:08] I don't know I don't think that we'll
[49:11] ever run into a situation that the EU is
[49:13] currently having but I know our judicial
[49:16] system will work and it is working
[49:18] because states are somewhat Sovereign
[49:20] right we are the United States of
[49:22] America so we're united we have a
[49:25] federal government obviously in States
[49:26] governments and there are many states
[49:28] right now to include my own
[49:30] Texas who are going nope no cbdcs are
[49:34] coming this way you know we will mine
[49:36] Bitcoin we will use our energy our our
[49:38] state's energy and we will you know we
[49:41] will do these things and you are not
[49:42] going to Tread On Us for that and so
[49:46] again I don't know very much about the
[49:48] EU but i' if if the president ever said
[49:52] you know I'm going to ban all Bitcoin oh
[49:55] that's not going to happen in the
[49:56] Americas it's just simply not our
[49:59] legislative branch and our judicial
[50:01] branch were a lot like that happen at
[50:03] least not it's it's it's in the EU it's
[50:07] an interesting because the EU it's
[50:10] they're trying to regulate a lot the
[50:12] good thing is um the states the
[50:16] countries they're even more independent
[50:19] uh um and okay I'm not an expert
[50:22] actually but uh from my feeling they're
[50:24] even more independent because a lot of
[50:26] of lws with even the data laws they were
[50:33] not there's a lot going on in the EU a
[50:36] lot of uh regulations top down uh and
[50:40] then countries decide on their own how
[50:42] to implement them and they have to
[50:44] execute them also uh and uh I see
[50:50] um for good that it's all very slow so
[50:55] that's the good thing but unfortunately
[50:58] uh they are really passionate about
[51:00] their digital Euro uh where I see in in
[51:04] America I'm like I'm really proud of the
[51:06] Americans uh and there are so many great
[51:08] forces against the cbdcs and saying like
[51:10] this will not come to us um then we also
[51:14] have Canada where they're saying uh
[51:17] they're al already putting things into
[51:20] place where they are connecting bank
[51:22] accounts to the social credit system
[51:24] which is why
[51:27] why doing it um so it's it's an it will
[51:31] be an interesting next few years um but
[51:34] in the end Bitcoin doesn't care and I'm
[51:37] prepared to move that's yeah no I hear
[51:40] you I I if I had to I would move as well
[51:43] maybe South America you know some
[51:45] countries that their government is less
[51:48] involved probably because the government
[51:50] is not even you know it's not Adept it's
[51:53] not even functioning and those people
[51:55] are are used you know Bitcoin as a as a
[51:58] means of of of trying to preserve their
[52:01] wealth or create their wealth because
[52:03] their country's currency is is nothing
[52:06] you know it's just
[52:07] paper and uh so I I do have I do have
[52:12] some faith in our country and the people
[52:15] of America and our
[52:17] country um you know but they're fighting
[52:20] us Robin because they know that you're
[52:23] right they they know what Bitcoin offers
[52:25] they're afraid they're afraid of it it
[52:28] will it will eventually lead to their
[52:31] downfall um and it's as simple as that
[52:34] they and many do realize that but I I do
[52:37] I think I had told you that I tried to
[52:40] keep an arms length with politics um
[52:44] with Bitcoin because I do view Bitcoin
[52:47] as being a moral like it or not a
[52:51] political and
[52:53] agnostic and I do feel that we need to
[52:56] grow our Bitcoin tent wider and not
[52:59] shrink it you know we need to let anyone
[53:02] in regardless of their social constructs
[53:06] ideologies religious beliefs or anything
[53:09] related to how they may feel or perceive
[53:11] other things because that's not what
[53:14] Bitcoin is you know it is not is not for
[53:17] only certain set of people it's for
[53:19] everyone it's it's a Global Currency and
[53:22] I do kind of like to push back
[53:25] especially those that
[53:27] espouse libertarian points of view that
[53:29] freedom for all well that means freedom
[53:32] for everyone and how they feel and act
[53:34] and do whether we agree or disagree or
[53:38] whether we accept or we don't accept bit
[53:42] coins for
[53:43] everyone 100% And um this is also
[53:48] something that I'm kind of sad something
[53:50] about of the Bitcoin community that are
[53:52] like like oh you you're not a Bitcoin
[53:55] you're not this and this I'm like H
[53:57] every like you don't have to be a
[53:58] bitcoiner to to have Bitcoin and uh who
[54:01] who's to say what a bitcoiner is like
[54:04] right you're right yeah it's just in the
[54:07] end of the day it's a tool it's it's
[54:09] money like it's everybody can use it and
[54:12] that's the great thing about because
[54:13] bank accounts don't have this bank
[54:15] accounts uh actually uh are um saying no
[54:21] you cannot open a bank account with you
[54:23] here because that and that reason right
[54:26] and for austrians it's it's not hard
[54:28] it's hard to imagine because we have a
[54:30] banking rate of like
[54:32] 99.999% almost everybody has a bank
[54:34] account but there are other countries I
[54:36] mean India is a really big country only
[54:39] 20% uh I think 20% are unbanked uh when
[54:43] I recall it or only 20% banked I think
[54:45] 20% are unbanked uh which is which is
[54:49] crazy Then There Are Places on the earth
[54:51] that are just 50% un banked and or like
[54:55] even L than that there are places there
[54:58] there's on the global scale there are
[54:59] more people with an internet connection
[55:01] or smartphone than with a bank which is
[55:03] an
[55:04] great statistics and then we now zoom
[55:08] out like the next 50 years and and we we
[55:13] try to figure out okay what are we
[55:15] looking for what's Bitcoin success look
[55:18] like if you think like oh in 50 years uh
[55:22] and we want to say Bitcoin was
[55:24] successful how does this will look like
[55:27] in 50 years that we can confident say in
[55:30] 50 years oh Bitcoin was actually
[55:32] successful what has Bitcoin then done to
[55:34] the
[55:36] world and that's a that's a profound
[55:39] question right to try to think into the
[55:42] future what I what I think uh with that
[55:46] with a response to that is that as long
[55:49] as Bitcoin keeps doing what it does
[55:51] right now it will be the same thing it
[55:54] will be better for
[55:56] for the human race 50 years from now if
[55:59] it's just what it is
[56:02] today I
[56:03] consider I kind of view Bitcoin as a a
[56:08] digital
[56:10] organism in a sense perhaps that's kind
[56:13] of unusual but I kind of Akin it to a
[56:18] mathematical cyberspace organism of code
[56:21] and it uses humans to keep it alive
[56:24] right it pays us and Rewards us to keep
[56:27] it alive to keep it going so it will
[56:31] always be here whether we're here or not
[56:33] because artificial intelligence will do
[56:35] the same
[56:37] thing and it also I mean if you think
[56:40] about it it it it stores the rest of
[56:44] itself all of us want the rest of the
[56:47] Bitcoin right that's locked in time on
[56:50] the time chain we'd like to have it
[56:52] right now but we can't so others will be
[56:54] able to have some too right right I mean
[56:56] it's it it keeps itself Alive by us
[57:00] continuing to interact with it and
[57:02] rewards us for doing so and it uses the
[57:05] energy that we give it to protect itself
[57:09] so as long as it's continuing to do what
[57:11] it does now 50 100 a thousand years from
[57:14] now then it's doing exactly what it's
[57:16] supposed to do so I I think of it from a
[57:19] philosophical standpoint because I
[57:21] cannot predict the future just like The
[57:24] Arrow of time there's uncertainness
[57:25] there's uniqueness there's Randomness
[57:28] and there's no way any of us can do that
[57:30] we can speculate on prices we can we can
[57:32] speculate on many things but bitcoin's
[57:36] Arrow of time will be deterministic for
[57:39] itself for however long it is
[57:43] alive uh that's an amazing point to come
[57:47] to our end routin actually uh I think
[57:50] this is such a beautiful statement in
[57:52] the in itself uh and uh as you might
[57:57] know we have an end routine where the
[57:59] previous guest is asking a question for
[58:01] the next guest without knowing who who
[58:03] the next guest is uh and the previous
[58:07] guest asks you because uh he might or
[58:11] she actually might uh look for the
[58:13] answer herself um if you had to start
[58:17] and this is actually something if if if
[58:19] you don't have it you should definitely
[58:21] have it uh and you still definitely
[58:23] started Julian um if you had to start a
[58:26] Bitcoin podcast how would you name it um
[58:30] let me think about that I guess I would
[58:32] name it The Life and Times of
[58:35] Bitcoin perfect then that's your that's
[58:38] your start of your Bitcoin podcast right
[58:40] oh there you go maybe one day I can have
[58:43] the greats of Robin Seer on my uh on my
[58:46] The Life and Times of Bitcoin podcast I
[58:49] I would love to be the first guest
[58:51] actually yeah well maybe we'll do that
[58:53] who
[58:54] knows I think you have the pro perfect
[58:56] voice to do anything
[58:59] with as like I said maybe I could be the
[59:02] voice of Bitcoin have you buy your
[59:04] Bitcoin
[59:05] [Laughter]
[59:08] today um Julian it was amazing to have
[59:11] you on uh it was a great pleasure this
[59:14] over one hour of what we are now
[59:16] recording is is was flying by so quickly
[59:20] I'm truly thinking of maybe doing more
[59:23] and extensively longer podcast even in
[59:26] the future because one hour seems so
[59:28] short like it's like we just started
[59:31] like we're just gotting warmed up now uh
[59:34] but yeah it's it's it's been a pleasure
[59:36] thank you for being on and for for
[59:39] everybody that is now curious uh about
[59:42] you and want to know ask your questions
[59:44] where can they find you or where can
[59:47] people U yeah reach you uh you know I'm
[59:50] mostly just on on X at this point so at
[59:53] Bitcoin meiser is my handle so be kind
[59:56] and check it out and you know maybe give
[59:59] me a follow but I've really really
[60:01] enjoyed my time with you Robin uh I
[60:03] think you're you're doing wonderful
[60:05] things for the community and I I just I
[60:08] just think it's amazing I appreciate you
[60:10] having the time and considering me to be
[60:12] on your I'm humbled so thank you and I
[60:15] hope we get to do this again thank you I
[60:17] will definitely do it I think this is a
[60:20] question that came up with some previous
[60:21] guests especially in in the beginnings
[60:24] like I will do a second round of my
[60:25] guest
[60:26] it's just that there are so many great
[60:28] people in Bitcoin and I did not get to
[60:32] any of them it feels like you're my 80th
[60:34] guest now and I feel like I'm just
[60:37] barely scratching the surface of
[60:39] bitcoiners and I this this is like I
[60:41] want to have the biggest variety of
[60:45] guests on my podcast uh and I want to
[60:48] have 300 people just this year on my
[60:52] podcast uh so uh I will definitely do
[60:56] second round I will definitely do a
[60:57] second round with you I just don't know
[60:59] when the time will come probably year
[61:02] probably next year yeah I'm looking
[61:03] forward to yeah great I mean you have
[61:05] plenty of people out there to choose
[61:06] from so I think 300 is a noble goal and
[61:09] I bet you'll make it perfect then thank
[61:12] you Julian and yeah thank you see you
[61:14] soon take care
[61:20] Robin
