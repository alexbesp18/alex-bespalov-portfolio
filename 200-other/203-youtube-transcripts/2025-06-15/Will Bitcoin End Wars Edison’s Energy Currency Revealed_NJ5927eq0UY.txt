[00:00] If you want to live off- grid, for
[00:01] example, you need energy. You want
[00:03] farming systems, fuel systems, water
[00:05] systems, heating systems. And Bitcoin
[00:07] integrate, and we're seeing all the
[00:09] storytelling of this. Bitcoin integrates
[00:10] with all of those systems, but still
[00:12] connects us at the digital level that if
[00:14] merchants understands their costs to
[00:16] produce things in Bitcoin, then they can
[00:18] lock those costs in and determine a
[00:20] price in which they'll sell things in
[00:22] Bitcoin. So, it goes from producer to
[00:24] consumer and the unit of account aspect
[00:26] of things. I believe mining will be that
[00:28] accelerant that as the latest efficiency
[00:30] machines are deployed in warehouses at
[00:32] volume to economically mine that a
[00:34] larger and everinccreasing amount of
[00:36] majority of hash rate will be people
[00:38] that just want to heat their home,
[00:39] subsidize some of that energy cost and
[00:41] get paid Bitcoin for doing it. Thomas
[00:43] Edison and Henry Ford conceptualizing
[00:45] the idea of an energy based currency to
[00:48] stop wars and debase gold as a monetary
[00:50] reserve. There's anyone that's wishing
[00:51] to take some step in life that knows is
[00:54] going to give them forward momentum,
[00:56] just do it. Just take that leap.
[01:00] [Music]
[01:02] For the people that don't know you, um,
[01:04] give us some small short brief overview
[01:06] of like who you are and and why you are
[01:08] into Bitcoin.
[01:11] Uh, where to begin? So, my I'll roll it
[01:14] all the way back. So, my grandfather and
[01:17] my dad, they were both uh engineers. So
[01:20] I've always been around people that you
[01:22] know uh have a precedence to wanting to
[01:25] pull things apart, questioning
[01:26] everything. And obviously I went in to
[01:29] study aerospace engineering at
[01:31] university and whilst studying um you
[01:35] well here in England our salaries for
[01:38] such for such industry are very low. Um
[01:41] and yeah just wanted more for myself
[01:44] shall I say. or just the majority of
[01:46] people of a younger age, half your life
[01:48] grown up outside playing, the other half
[01:51] burying your head in a in a laptop or,
[01:53] you know, a games console, whatever it
[01:55] is. And I I had my fair share of those
[01:57] two parts as well. And yeah, just
[02:00] throughout the the the journey of my
[02:02] life, I've I've very much wanted both
[02:05] more for myself, family, life, love,
[02:07] living, love to travel as well. Um,
[02:10] interestingly, I visited El Salvad El
[02:12] Salvador just before um they went
[02:15] anything to do with Bitcoin and um so
[02:18] all of these sorts of things and it's
[02:20] culminated that I wanted more for myself
[02:22] in university and yeah sort of truly
[02:25] dived into Bitcoin in 2017 as the
[02:28] starting point but obviously 2017
[02:32] captured anyone and everyone in the in
[02:34] the ICO world of things. So, uh, I got
[02:36] burnt as they say and and that really
[02:39] hardens and learn allows you to learn
[02:41] those lessons all the way up to building
[02:45] algorithmic trading systems and bots and
[02:48] those, you know, staying up all night
[02:50] checking the screen at 4 in the morning.
[02:52] And so those lessons of learning what
[02:54] you do want and don't want within
[02:55] Bitcoin um gravitated me further and
[02:58] closer towards mining and um and just
[03:02] that aspect of people wanting to create
[03:04] a cash flow of Bitcoin with um the the
[03:08] technical electrical there's also the
[03:11] financial frictions of mining as well.
[03:12] all those all those sorts of things. I
[03:15] gravitated just just wholeheartedly
[03:17] towards mining because it it combined
[03:19] what I wanted to be involved with
[03:21] Bitcoin um my background and um for the
[03:26] past few years from 2021 onwards I've
[03:29] just been on this absolute path of just
[03:33] just going down the compute direction of
[03:36] Bitcoin where the majority of the world
[03:39] have gone in the financial direction
[03:40] with understanding Bitcoin. the miners
[03:43] very much go down, you know, gravitating
[03:45] towards the energy direction. And the
[03:47] very reason I created a an educational
[03:50] channel called Hash Power Academy is
[03:51] it's the compute branch in the middle.
[03:54] Uh where you've got the energy world
[03:55] obsessed with energy in the financial
[03:57] world obsessed with finance, but compute
[03:59] is the bit that bridges the the two. Um,
[04:02] so that's where I'm at today where I'm
[04:04] engaged in mining education that allows
[04:07] people that may be more on the financial
[04:08] side to just open up their interest into
[04:11] the mining side. Not so much having to
[04:13] participate in mining because it's it's
[04:15] got highly competitive aspect to it, but
[04:18] just learning about it because it
[04:19] teaches you so much more about all the
[04:21] other layers of Bitcoin. Interesting.
[04:24] Um, and I I want to talk about what what
[04:26] uh Bitcoin Money taught you, but first,
[04:29] how do you see, and I think I actually
[04:31] saw a video of yours also titled buying
[04:33] Bitcoin versus mining Bitcoin. I think
[04:34] MSDR was also like one part of that. But
[04:37] how do you look at buying Bitcoin versus
[04:40] mining Bitcoin? I boil it down to well,
[04:43] buying Bitcoin is going to always be the
[04:44] metric for everyone. You buy one
[04:46] Bitcoin, you've got a Bitcoin. But
[04:47] mining a bitcoin is well your objective
[04:50] goal with mining is to accumulate a
[04:52] greater quantity of bitcoin over time.
[04:56] So you're not even setting up an
[04:58] operation to immediately buy bitcoin.
[05:01] You believe so much in bitcoin that
[05:02] you're not even buying bitcoin. You're
[05:04] buying into machines that produce it
[05:05] into the future. So uh the belief system
[05:08] that you have to have in mining uh in
[05:11] Bitcoin in general shall I say is that
[05:13] you are going to capture um a greater
[05:16] quantity and that that is only going to
[05:20] be accessible right now for a select few
[05:23] people that that have the technical
[05:25] skills to to run it, the electrical
[05:28] skills to keep it going and not burn
[05:30] down or all those things or the
[05:31] financial ability to buy the machines in
[05:33] bulk. If you don't have those pieces of
[05:35] criteria, you're going to have to try
[05:37] hosting, which is you need to invest a
[05:40] lot of money to get a cheaper price of
[05:42] machines because those are the pieces
[05:44] that are always missing from the
[05:46] education. Um especially when people
[05:48] fall into the trap of going into crypto
[05:50] mining, which is by the time they buy
[05:52] the machine that says they're going to
[05:54] make their money back in 4 months, uh so
[05:57] many of those machines get produced that
[05:59] dilutes the very small amount of money
[06:01] distributed in that particular
[06:03] blockchain. And and so there's this
[06:05] knowledge gap. There's there's this key
[06:07] knowledge gap um when it comes to the
[06:09] the mining versus buying phenomena,
[06:12] especially on the mining side. Um, and
[06:15] yeah, I think that answers your
[06:17] question. That's that's super
[06:19] interesting. Um, I mean, it's also how
[06:23] do you look at uh when when someone else
[06:25] hosts uh those things for you? I mean,
[06:27] there's so many providers where you can
[06:29] just like buy uh things and they do all
[06:32] the things for you and and you get a cut
[06:34] from that. Did you look into this? Yeah.
[06:37] So the I boil it down to there's
[06:41] two this is this is where the education
[06:43] comes in. You've got to know the current
[06:47] profitability of mining the economics of
[06:49] the machines. The fragmented hardware
[06:52] market where the closer to the producer
[06:54] the cheaper the machine you price per
[06:56] terash the closer to consumption which
[06:58] is there is a key difference between
[07:00] that computer in the USA actively racked
[07:04] hashing power contract deployed. So
[07:06] there's a premium aspect versus that
[07:08] machine sitting in a box in a warehouse
[07:11] um in on in Asia. And so there's there's
[07:15] just several lessons. And I've got the
[07:17] the layers of Bitcoin behind me, but
[07:20] basically you have to learn um it's
[07:23] cliche, but it boils down to energy,
[07:25] space, and time. You've got to know what
[07:27] your power rate is, how much hash rate
[07:29] you're buying, say per per uh dollar
[07:31] amount, and and over time what that
[07:34] profitability is. uh into the into the
[07:37] future and to get into hosted mining.
[07:41] Yes, you can buy in with one machine
[07:43] with quite a few hosts, but there's
[07:45] premiums. Um you've also got the fact
[07:48] that some hosts put their, you know,
[07:50] they are doing all of the operation for
[07:52] you. So, they take a cut. And I would
[07:54] say just about any business within
[07:56] Bitcoin, understand the put yourself in
[08:00] the business's shoes. understand how
[08:01] they make their money cuz that will
[08:03] allow you clear information how you're
[08:05] going to earn yours. So, a lot of hosts
[08:07] put their costs of operation all into
[08:10] the price of power. Uh maybe they maybe
[08:12] they get the power at 5 cent and charge
[08:14] you 8 cents and their margin is the 3
[08:17] cent. And some other hosts, they offer a
[08:19] low power rate, but they'll take a
[08:21] percentage of your revenue, five, a 10,
[08:24] a 20% even. And you've got to use those
[08:28] metrics to truly forward project and uh
[08:32] essentially cut the projection in half
[08:34] to have some form of realistic uh sense.
[08:37] So, and don't ever
[08:39] overestimate. Um yeah, it makes me think
[08:42] I'm going to do a video on hosted mining
[08:44] economics actually and those
[08:45] comparisons. But yeah, the last last
[08:48] question on that topic, uh how much does
[08:50] the price uh play play a role? I heard
[08:53] that if if the price goes up rapidly,
[08:56] mining is actually uh better and if it
[08:58] it's kind of uh slowly getting up, uh
[09:01] buying would be better. Yeah. If if you
[09:03] use the Moonboy numbers, if Bitcoin
[09:06] price were to go to a million, miners
[09:09] right now would be earning $1 per
[09:11] kilowatt hour, which if you're buying
[09:14] electricity at 5 6 7 8 cents, you reach
[09:17] a point doesn't really matter at that
[09:18] point. But here's the thing. price can
[09:21] double, but the network hash rate and
[09:24] all the infrastructure, shipping,
[09:26] logistics, electrical switch gear
[09:28] transform, all of those the physical
[09:31] constraints of hash rate doubling means
[09:34] that if price were to take off because
[09:36] Bitcoin to dollar is that 21 million
[09:38] units versus the debt money system, if
[09:41] the debt money system has to expand, as
[09:43] it very much needs to um just to justify
[09:47] its own existence, um it means that the
[09:50] units are going to shoot up in price to
[09:53] the dollar and minor production floor
[09:55] cannot increase as quickly and every uh
[10:00] bull cycle for miners is when price in
[10:03] say percentage terms is outperforming
[10:06] difficulty and yeah if we see Bitcoin
[10:09] quote unquote take off the network hash
[10:12] rate just cannot keep up and that's when
[10:14] miners will be absolutely raking it in
[10:16] but the key thing for every one of a
[10:19] retail level is when mining
[10:21] profitability is at stupidly high
[10:23] metrics and values of break even 4
[10:25] months that's when you sell when mining
[10:29] profitability is
[10:30] extremely you know impossible like
[10:33] you'll never make your money back is the
[10:35] I paid you know $20 per terahash but I'm
[10:38] barely making uh under a dollar per
[10:41] terash that's 20 months or or 30 40 50
[10:44] months when the mining profitability is
[10:46] absolutely dead that's paradoxically the
[10:49] best time to buy machines. Um, but but
[10:51] it's the same with the trading
[10:53] psychology. When everyone's going one
[10:54] way, you got to go the other.
[10:57] Super interesting.
[10:58] So, I I get from all that, and this was
[11:02] also my notion beforehand, most people
[11:05] will be just better off buying straight
[11:08] up Bitcoin and putting it in self
[11:09] custody. Yes and no. Um, what I think
[11:12] people keep resonating with, especially
[11:14] in some of the content I've talked
[11:16] about, is uh the long-term dream for me
[11:19] is to is to use Bitcoin mining as an
[11:23] accelerant to build out, should we say,
[11:25] Bitcoin infrastructure. And what I mean
[11:27] by that is every part of Bitcoin has
[11:30] willing participants. the majority of
[11:32] people in Bitcoin right now there's that
[11:36] active push for self-
[11:37] custody but then you've got the passage
[11:40] of time um which is that inevitably the
[11:44] majority of the wealth of the world that
[11:46] people have you know the sort of sailor
[11:47] metrics of x amount of treasuries bonds
[11:50] equities and all these sorts of pieces
[11:52] that any any aspect of them flooding
[11:55] into bitcoin are those uh holders of
[11:58] wealth going to just trust it in someone
[12:01] else's hands like they've done the rest
[12:03] of their lives or or even people with a
[12:05] substantial amount of Bitcoin hearing
[12:07] the concerns of people uh you know the
[12:10] wrench attack and so so I think people
[12:13] having a mix of self custody for the
[12:16] majority but active amounts that's
[12:19] accessible or the multi-IG setup or the
[12:21] time locks what all those sorts of
[12:23] pieces are important um but but to your
[12:26] question about you know mining versus
[12:28] buying is I see mining infrastructure
[12:31] you know, to to deploy a megawatt of
[12:33] compute, the the 200, the 300 mining
[12:35] machines for one megawatt. Well, you
[12:38] need, you know, the electrical
[12:39] infrastructure or the power source to to
[12:42] provide that. That doesn't have to be
[12:44] specifically just a data center in the
[12:47] middle of West Texas. It could also be
[12:51] um a you know the the storytelling of
[12:53] gridless in Africa that are you know the
[12:57] the the large buyer of energy the miners
[13:00] justifies the continual buildout for the
[13:02] large producer of energy. So you got
[13:04] this energy circular economy at the base
[13:06] layer and then the things I talk about
[13:08] which is that block rewards set a price
[13:11] for electricity and what that does is
[13:15] it's it's inevitable that yes you can
[13:17] see the dollar to bitcoin exchange rate
[13:18] but it also has a bitcoin to kilowatt
[13:20] hour exchange rate and that sets a price
[13:23] for energy that that large buyer of
[13:25] energy will also sell it. they will
[13:27] relinquish their use of that power. And
[13:29] it doesn't have to be grid scale. It
[13:31] this system can be as small as a couple
[13:34] of homes, a uh small block of compute
[13:39] that consumes the energy of all the
[13:41] different properties. And it delves down
[13:43] the uh the Bitcoin Citadel sort of
[13:45] dream, which is people that want to have
[13:48] their ability to live off-rid, but
[13:50] cannot figure out the economics of how
[13:52] that truly work, say, as a a pension
[13:55] plan. But if if you want to live off-rid
[13:58] for example, you need energy. You want
[14:01] farming systems, fuel systems, water
[14:03] systems, heating systems. And Bitcoin
[14:06] integrate and we're seeing all the
[14:07] storytelling of this. Bitcoin integrates
[14:09] with all of those systems, but still
[14:11] connects us at the digital level. Um,
[14:14] and what I love to talk about is because
[14:17] Bitcoin sets a price for energy. I
[14:20] believe that say a bitcoin unit of
[14:22] account doesn't come from you know
[14:24] what's my coffee merchant going to
[14:27] charge me in a quantity of bitcoin it's
[14:29] what's the coffee merchants's energy
[14:30] costs oh well that's priced in bitcoin
[14:32] because kilowatt hours are priced in
[14:34] bitcoin as of now but that system hasn't
[14:36] fully built out yet um that if merchants
[14:39] understands their costs to produce
[14:41] things in bitcoin then they can lock
[14:44] those costs in and determine a price in
[14:46] which they'll sell things in bitcoin so
[14:48] it it goes from producer the two
[14:50] consumer and the unit of account aspect
[14:52] of things. When you take that to the um
[14:56] people that want to live off- grid,
[14:57] they're still connected to that same
[14:59] pricing system because Bitcoin sets a
[15:01] global price for energy. And so um
[15:05] that's a very long form version of your
[15:08] question of uh self-custody versus
[15:11] mining is I I believe mining will be
[15:13] that accelerant that as the latest
[15:16] efficiency machines are deployed in
[15:18] warehouses at volume to economically
[15:20] mine that a larger an everinccreasing
[15:22] amount of majority of hash rate will be
[15:25] people that just want to heat their home
[15:28] subsidize some of that energy cost and
[15:29] get paid Bitcoin for doing it. have the
[15:32] heating system connected to a water
[15:33] tank, which means they've always always
[15:35] got hot water and run the hot pipes into
[15:37] green houses to grow crops at optimized
[15:40] levels. Those are all different like
[15:42] technical things, but as that becomes
[15:44] more plugandplay, press a button and
[15:47] mini miners are really starting that
[15:48] accelerant. Interesting. You also said
[15:50] in the beginning that Bitcoin mining
[15:54] taught you so much more than just the
[15:56] mining aspect. What did it teach you?
[15:59] Satoshi Nakamoto himself never went on a
[16:02] platform, never went on an exchange. He
[16:05] produced his Bitcoin um with
[16:09] electricity. And um interestingly
[16:12] enough, I as a kid, I tried to mine
[16:14] Bitcoin in 2014, I think. Opened up a
[16:18] laptop, tried to connect to a mining
[16:19] pool with my lap laptop, so it wouldn't
[16:21] have made that much if it did, but I
[16:24] hadn't put the letter P for the password
[16:26] in. And uh yeah, so I slammed the lid in
[16:29] 2014 and obviously wished that I had uh
[16:32] just I would have had the curiosity to
[16:34] to learn about what it is and how it
[16:36] works. Um and yeah, that that that boils
[16:40] me back to my first ever interaction,
[16:42] shall I say, with with with mining and
[16:45] the the the technical electrical side of
[16:47] of Bitcoin. But the struggle the
[16:50] struggle is that the the on-ramp for
[16:53] Bitcoin is always the financial lens for
[16:56] the large majority of people. I'm sure
[16:58] there's some, you know, what if you take
[17:00] a 100 Bitcoiners, how many of them came
[17:03] from a financial lens of understanding
[17:06] Bitcoin and that that dollar comparison
[17:08] versus they were, I don't know, saw
[17:11] someone mining and learned about it from
[17:14] them and just started mining and maybe
[17:15] came from the energy aspect that if the
[17:18] majority come from finance,
[17:21] um, you start hitting the topics of
[17:23] blockchain and network hash rate and
[17:25] difficulty and you go deeper and deeper
[17:27] and even deeper, it just gets more
[17:28] technical. So that the group of people
[17:30] that that learn about those things um
[17:33] declines. But the key the key thing I
[17:36] think for anyone that say is a trader
[17:40] is when it drops, they want to know how
[17:42] much it drops. When it goes up, they
[17:44] want to know how much it it increases.
[17:46] And I believe that the Bitcoin per kilow
[17:50] kilowatt hour production floor
[17:52] determines a very interesting
[17:55] electricity to Bitcoin exchange rate
[17:57] that miners will buy power, produce and
[18:00] sell Bitcoin or switch off and sell the
[18:04] power and in a sense buy a greater
[18:07] quantity because if they're arbiting um
[18:10] both ways it means that when price drops
[18:13] below production and we see hash rate
[18:15] come offline fine if that hash rate is
[18:18] deployed on grids where they have access
[18:19] to selling the power and doing the
[18:21] arbitrage it's essentially a natural
[18:24] buyer steps in and so I think Satoshi
[18:27] himself referred to Bitcoin's value
[18:29] being its electricity cost to produce um
[18:32] but it's not like gold mining gold
[18:34] mining is x amount of cost of processing
[18:38] rock $2,000 worth of rock processing to
[18:41] produce the $3,000 whatever the value is
[18:44] right now 3,000 ounce of gold, but you
[18:46] can't sell that rock for $3,000 at the
[18:49] equivalent value of the Bitcoin. But
[18:51] with Bitcoin, it's intrinsically
[18:53] connected to electricity because energy
[18:56] produces compute which produces Bitcoin.
[18:58] And electricity in of itself is the most
[19:01] important commodity of the 21st century.
[19:04] Um and obviously compute and microchips
[19:08] just about are the the the other side of
[19:11] the coin so to speak that um I just took
[19:14] a trip up to Scotland actually and in
[19:17] the highlands middle of nowhere but the
[19:20] the two slash three things that you can
[19:22] see driving down this road and you got
[19:25] the uh the uh electrical grid running
[19:28] past me on one side and uh telephone
[19:31] poles running the other. So, it's like
[19:33] it it's just a no-brainer that the two
[19:35] most important networks of living in the
[19:39] 21st century is the electricity grid and
[19:41] the internet. And Bitcoin just creates a
[19:43] circular economy between those two with
[19:45] a fixed supply unit of money uh on top
[19:48] of that on top of that system. Wow. It
[19:50] it it sounds like it it sounds like
[19:54] Bitcoin is almost more connected to
[19:56] nature than gold is. Even though gold is
[19:59] like coming directly from nature, but uh
[20:02] Bitcoin is connected to energy and
[20:04] energy is is therefore uh really nicely
[20:06] connected to nature.
[20:09] Yeah. Yeah. I uh I see I well I refer to
[20:14] it as digital mother nature and with
[20:15] mining it takes no prisoners. The
[20:17] network doesn't care. you're either
[20:19] efficient and mining mining is a
[20:23] redistribution system of of the units to
[20:25] those most efficient. I mentioned before
[20:27] you know price drops hash rate switches
[20:29] off but it's the inefficient hash rate
[20:31] that switches off. So there are concerns
[20:34] right now say for mining which is if
[20:36] more mining comes offline and the
[20:38] security budget drops it's yeah but the
[20:40] most efficient miners stay online and
[20:42] then get paid more. So yeah, on the
[20:45] mother mother nature side of things,
[20:46] she's brutal and she doesn't care. Um
[20:49] just just redistributes the money units
[20:52] to those most efficient and those adding
[20:54] the most value to society because
[20:55] they're producing the most compute, thus
[20:57] deploying the most electrical um
[21:00] infrastructure and monetizing it. On the
[21:03] mother nature side of things, there's a
[21:05] I I like to refer to Bitcoin in terms
[21:07] of, you know, the the the the tree. The
[21:10] tree is the best analogy I find for for
[21:12] Bitcoin, which is mining is that roots.
[21:14] You know, a tree sort of is connected to
[21:17] two worlds, which is the the ether, the
[21:20] the digital side of the branches and the
[21:23] sweet fruit of Bitcoin. um fragmenting
[21:26] and the the transactional noise of the
[21:28] network and the the the Twitter the
[21:31] tweets in the tree so to speak and then
[21:33] the blockchain is like the rings of the
[21:35] tree as it grows older and builds more
[21:38] layers and that doesn't change it just
[21:39] stores the truth of what happened to the
[21:41] tree so to speak and then you got the
[21:44] root system which is all the mining and
[21:46] that energy source and and uh yeah the
[21:49] the the breath of the network shall we
[21:51] say but that that goes on a bit of a
[21:53] tangent but it's it's an interesting
[21:55] analogy to to see Bitcoin and the well
[21:58] even the sort of relationship trees have
[22:00] to each other which is the sort of
[22:02] mycelium network of uh the the
[22:04] connections um and as we connect more in
[22:08] Bitcoin just so much more is going to
[22:11] come from it and that's a it's a very
[22:13] open statement but but truly I think the
[22:15] more the more people that join we're
[22:17] just going to see so many more things
[22:20] that that connectivity such as the the
[22:22] citadels all developing everywhere where
[22:25] they'll start connecting with each other
[22:27] um through trade and pricing of goods
[22:29] and services in Bitcoin. So, uh the
[22:32] analogy goes very far, shall I
[22:35] say? It's it's uh as I said with the
[22:38] inefficient ones, it's it's like Darin,
[22:40] the ones that don't survive. Do you
[22:42] think is there's a um a danger of
[22:46] centralization through miners because
[22:48] the the best ones and the most efficient
[22:50] ones are winning or is it more like the
[22:53] smaller ones the mining the mini miners
[22:55] at home the the heaters are are kind of
[22:58] winning out in in the quantity?
[23:01] Um, I think mini mining is a good
[23:03] educational tool. Um, because when you
[23:06] compare the amount of bit axes compared
[23:09] to industrial scale mining, it's a
[23:11] rounding error. As to centralization,
[23:15] you can observe
[23:17] uh the way that I have the network built
[23:20] in six parts, which is produce energy,
[23:23] produce electricity, the hardware, the
[23:25] hash rate, the blockchain, and Bitcoin
[23:27] in of itself.
[23:29] You've got the decentralization of where
[23:31] the mining's deployed. So by countries,
[23:34] power sources, off-rid, on grid. You got
[23:37] the decentralization of the electrical
[23:39] grid in a sense. So you can look at how
[23:41] much hash rate is by nation. And
[23:44] obviously the majority is now US and but
[23:47] there's sort of this there is this not
[23:50] power balance but it's the hash rate
[23:53] deployed of the network is US side but
[23:56] the source of production of the
[23:57] hardware. So it's almost like the the
[23:59] opex of mining is in the US but the
[24:02] capex of mining is is is produced in say
[24:05] China and all the the chip fab nations
[24:10] and there's there's always dangers of u
[24:13] back back doors in the in the hardware
[24:17] um the mining pools and and mining
[24:19] mining pools are bitcoin miners
[24:22] converting into hashes. They don't
[24:25] they're not producing their own block
[24:26] templates which is holding the destiny
[24:29] of uh you know I fought to find the next
[24:32] block in the chain. I'm going to decide
[24:34] what goes in my block which obviously
[24:36] delves into the discussion of the debate
[24:38] of uh at the moment in Bitcoin as to
[24:41] what should or shouldn't be in the
[24:42] blockchain. Um but I I boil it back down
[24:45] to miners are paid not to attack the
[24:47] network.
[24:50] How do you how do you like the debate
[24:52] currently going on with the uh OP return
[24:55] limit?
[24:57] Um the OP return limit aspect of things
[24:59] is um h
[25:02] so on one side you've got the miners who
[25:05] are the the one side you've got the
[25:08] miners who are being paid to add more
[25:12] blocks and then you got buyers that are
[25:15] paying to go into those blocks. So what
[25:17] you have is this pricing system of the
[25:20] holders of Bitcoin, I want to, you know,
[25:22] pay the least to store my transactions
[25:25] forever online and the miners adding
[25:27] those blocks and the people in the
[25:29] middle are the nodes. So you got this
[25:31] circular economy of uh data settlement
[25:35] with the data money and obviously block
[25:37] production to earn the data money, but
[25:40] the nodes sit in the middle as the
[25:41] volunteers. And I did just put a video
[25:43] out actually referring to the sort of
[25:45] timeline of how we got to where we are
[25:47] today. So sort of looking at this debate
[25:50] where we are today, where we came from
[25:52] from the beginning and where we're
[25:54] going. So from the from the node aspect
[25:58] of things running a node from the
[26:00] Satoshi era was you produced your own
[26:03] blocks. So you're a minor. You stored
[26:06] the data of those blocks that you
[26:08] produced or others produced and they
[26:10] sent to you through the network. the
[26:12] information and you owned the data in
[26:15] those blocks the bitcoin. So ownership
[26:18] through your private key as a holder
[26:20] storing the information as the sort of
[26:22] node function in of itself and updating
[26:25] the node updating the blockchain should
[26:27] we say. Um so all three components have
[26:31] now fragmented into different things. So
[26:35] holding Bitcoin got obfiscated and
[26:38] responsibility sort of handed off to
[26:40] platforms, exchanges, hardware wallets.
[26:44] Um what percentage are still holding
[26:46] their private keys? Uh and then on the
[26:50] the mining side of things, we went from
[26:52] CPUs to GPUs to A6 and it got inevitably
[26:55] harder. So the group of people actively
[26:57] in mining as a percentage of the network
[26:59] at any point in time has just gotten
[27:01] smaller. And so yeah, everything to do
[27:05] with your private key is fragmented off
[27:07] into this financial world of ETFs and
[27:09] all these sorts of things. Then
[27:11] everything on the energy side, mining,
[27:12] its own multi-billion dollar industry
[27:14] fragmenting into its own sector and the
[27:17] the financialization of running a node
[27:20] which is a mining pool. And you got the
[27:23] nodes in the middle that all this money
[27:25] and energy is circulating around them.
[27:27] that their function has not changed that
[27:30] we want them to store the information.
[27:32] The volunteers of the network juice
[27:35] Bitcoin miners producing um blocks.
[27:39] They're not producing Bitcoin. They're
[27:40] getting subsidy, but they're producing
[27:42] block space holders getting having to
[27:45] pay to put in those blocks. But again,
[27:47] you've got those nodes in the middle
[27:49] that that are sort of in the battle
[27:52] between those wanting to be paid to put
[27:54] as much in the blockchain and those
[27:56] wanting to pay. And so when it comes to
[28:00] today where we are is this fragmentation
[28:02] of all these different aspects and node
[28:05] running sort of been lost very much in
[28:08] in the in
[28:09] the node running has been lost in terms
[28:12] of its importance to those that are you
[28:15] know I'm going to hold Bitcoin my ETFs
[28:17] and give it to Sailor and all these
[28:20] sorts of things and then mining is
[28:21] they're not a lot of them aren't even
[28:23] running nodes they are hashing hashing
[28:25] they're selling their hash rate to a
[28:27] pool and they don't have to worry about
[28:29] the the the node running aspect. They
[28:30] are just producing hash rate and getting
[28:33] paid Bitcoin for doing so. So node
[28:36] running still remains that fundamental
[28:40] um bridge between the two energy and
[28:43] financial worlds of Bitcoin. And the OP
[28:45] return discussion is do we impose more
[28:48] cost on the volunteers of the network
[28:51] where mining is incentivized to to to
[28:54] get more efficient ships but nodes are
[28:57] not incentivized in any way to in
[29:00] financial terms to add more storage
[29:03] space because the blockchain uh file
[29:06] size so to speak is getting bigger and
[29:08] bigger at an everinccreasing rate. if
[29:10] the idea of it being a monetary network
[29:12] transitions to it being in cloud
[29:15] storage. And there's no there's no exact
[29:20] right or wrong answer here because we're
[29:22] all trying to figure out what tomorrow
[29:24] looks like which is subsidy disappear
[29:27] tomorrow but you know in a 100 years
[29:29] time subsidy is gone. We're just
[29:31] depending on how much is put in blocks.
[29:34] So for miners from the earlier
[29:36] discussions we've had it's uh their
[29:39] energy is being priced against block
[29:41] rewards. So if block rewards are purely
[29:44] fees, um the value of their energy is
[29:48] block the the fee market essentially.
[29:50] The fee market is the data settlement
[29:53] against their their their energy
[29:55] consumption which also sets the value of
[29:57] Bitcoin in electricity terms that if
[30:01] fees are really low, Bitcoin buys more
[30:04] energy from the miners paradoxically. So
[30:06] the you with with the fee rate low, the
[30:09] purchasing power, the amount of
[30:11] electricity you can buy with your
[30:13] Bitcoin really increases. But if the fee
[30:17] rate is really high, um miners are
[30:20] earning more Bitcoin for their energy
[30:22] use. So buying the it's paradoxical, but
[30:26] buying the energy is more expensive. So,
[30:28] Bitcoin transitions us away from a
[30:31] debt-based monetary system that has
[30:33] interest rates to determine the the
[30:35] value of money and the cost of capital
[30:37] to borrow debt and transitions us to an
[30:40] energy- based monetary system where the
[30:42] value of energy is deter the the price
[30:44] of energy rises and falls uh in
[30:47] correlation to the fee market which is
[30:49] an interesting way to see it where at
[30:51] the peak of the bull market where fees
[30:53] will be out of control um energy more
[30:56] energy inputs would be more expensive.
[30:58] expensive because miners are earning
[30:59] more so they'll rather monetize through
[31:02] the network versus selling it locally at
[31:04] a higher price in terms of Bitcoin. So
[31:06] that's where I see us in the future.
[31:09] Now as to today if blocks are empty and
[31:14] there's
[31:15] uh a capacity aspect that if if there's
[31:19] already the 1 to 4 megabyte aspect of of
[31:22] storage if that's empty
[31:24] um that that velocity of fees and energy
[31:28] circulating in the network is is less
[31:32] and the more the more the more
[31:34] circulation between these two worlds uh
[31:36] the more hash rates deployed which more
[31:38] energy infrastructure is deployed um
[31:41] which is that physical side but again
[31:44] the nodes in the middle are fronting all
[31:46] of this cost in terms of the data side
[31:48] uh I I see that sort of resurgence of
[31:51] all three functions of mining running a
[31:53] node and holding your own private keys
[31:55] your your bitcoin if if we reconnect
[31:59] those three like it used to be so to
[32:01] speak back in the day um I think I think
[32:04] if both three sectors sort of had more
[32:08] into connection. Um I think yeah I I I
[32:13] honestly think that the there'll be more
[32:15] nodes if people are actively
[32:18] participated in all three cuz it's
[32:20] there's a lot of people I'm sure they
[32:22] bought a mini miner and they go well now
[32:24] I want to run my own node connected to
[32:26] my mini minor into my own wallet and
[32:28] they are they you know they're connected
[32:29] to all three functions again. So that's
[32:32] education truly is is the solution. I
[32:35] didn't answer your question as to what I
[32:37] think of the OP return thing. Uh I
[32:40] wouldn't say my my knowledge in the the
[32:42] deep deep blockchain technicals are
[32:45] fully there. I'm just sort of using my
[32:48] knowledge of the understanding of how
[32:50] the different layers of energy
[32:53] comput and what that looks like in the
[32:55] future. Uh one one argument could be
[32:59] that if blocks are empty, could you the
[33:02] way the difficulty adjustment reg is a
[33:04] regulator for you know if there's more
[33:07] blocks raise a difficulty could the
[33:09] difficulty adjustment be a regulator for
[33:12] the amount of arbitrary data that goes
[33:15] in the blockchain by the the the nodes
[33:17] observing how empty or full blocks are
[33:21] and raising or you know increasing and
[33:24] decreasing the the the the the arbitrary
[33:28] data limit so that if blocks are empty,
[33:32] but yeah, it it still delves into that
[33:34] sort of discussion of is it strictly
[33:36] monetary or is it is it to be you know
[33:40] what's what price would you pay, what
[33:42] price should you pay to store
[33:43] information online forever, which is
[33:46] that's what the nodes offer, but they're
[33:48] not paid to do it. But if if a lot of
[33:51] nodes were mining, running a node and
[33:54] holding Bitcoin, they have a
[33:56] justification to continually buy more
[33:58] storage space because they're mining and
[34:01] and they're holding their Bitcoin as
[34:03] well. U doesn't quite give you an
[34:06] answer, I don't think, but it's just I'm
[34:08] trying to look in the future, try to
[34:10] look in the past and find some sense of
[34:12] where we are today. Let's take a break
[34:14] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[34:17] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[34:20] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[34:23] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[34:26] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[34:29] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[34:31] completely new and amazing Genesis
[34:34] edition of their watch collections. You
[34:37] have the date of the first ever mined
[34:40] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[34:42] also the block height and which epoch we
[34:45] are currently in. I love the level of
[34:48] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[34:51] Make sure to check out those amazing
[34:53] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[34:56] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[34:59] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[35:02] really do hope that you don't have it on
[35:04] exchange. But if you do have it on
[35:06] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[35:08] deal with that. The first way is you put
[35:10] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[35:12] entry for you to get into the
[35:15] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[35:18] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[35:21] super simple and secure way. And if you
[35:24] check out the link in the description,
[35:26] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[35:29] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[35:32] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[35:35] partner in terms of how to get the most
[35:38] out of your sovereignty. They will
[35:40] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[35:43] that is perfect for your individual
[35:46] situation. They will show you how you
[35:48] can secure your own devices. Securing
[35:51] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[35:53] have to keep all your devices secure.
[35:56] One topic that is overlooked often is
[35:58] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[36:01] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[36:04] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[36:06] place already? And last but not least,
[36:08] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[36:10] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[36:13] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[36:18] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:21] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:23] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:26] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:29] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:31] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:33] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:36] the link down in the description of
[36:38] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[36:40] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[36:44] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[36:46] there. Yeah, it's a it's it's a hard
[36:48] one. Uh I also haven't fully
[36:51] grasp where where I and we we should
[36:55] stand these days. For me, with every
[36:59] change in the Bitcoin network, it should
[37:01] always
[37:03] be the arguments on why we should change
[37:06] something should be extraordinary good.
[37:10] So, uh the status quo should be defended
[37:14] as good as possible and any change
[37:19] should have a really good argument why
[37:22] we should change that. that that's
[37:24] because I think Bitcoin doesn't live
[37:26] from constant change in the network in
[37:29] the base layer. It it lives
[37:32] from because we can rely on it because
[37:34] it's a reliable system and we can trust
[37:37] it for the next hundred thousands maybe
[37:39] even more than uh thousands of years. So
[37:43] every change for me is like we we need
[37:46] to find a really good reason why we do
[37:48] this because as most software developers
[37:51] know you change a little bit here and
[37:53] all of a sudden there's somewhere else a
[37:55] problem popping up. So uh for me it's
[37:58] just like is there a good enough reason
[38:00] to actually change that? I haven't heard
[38:02] one but I'm also not as good in deep in
[38:06] there and I also haven't researched
[38:07] really uh deeply yet. Uh but every
[38:10] change that gets um kind of post I'm
[38:14] like okay what is the real good reason
[38:17] to actually go ahead and do that because
[38:20] this not changing already worked 16
[38:22] years and yes we have to change things.
[38:25] I think if we now stick with the Bitcoin
[38:28] code that it is there and we never
[38:30] change anything I think Bitcoin will
[38:32] fail. There are just uh future
[38:34] developments coming that we need to
[38:36] change some things. Um, but it has to be
[38:39] a really freaking good reason to change
[38:42] something, not just like, oh, like the
[38:43] code gets a little bit more efficient.
[38:45] Yeah.
[38:46] Um, when it Well, what I mentioned about
[38:50] you got miners wanting to add as many
[38:52] blocks cuz they're paid the subsidy and
[38:54] there's block space for them to to sell
[38:56] to holders.
[38:57] Um, you've also got the aspect of
[39:00] holders wanting that fee rate to be as
[39:01] low as possible because it means more
[39:03] sovereignty and more access to block
[39:06] space because um, you can compare every
[39:09] UTXO, every quantity of Bitcoin in a
[39:12] wallet versus the fee rate and if the
[39:14] fee rate is higher than the quantity
[39:16] that Bitcoin becomes not null and void,
[39:19] but
[39:20] um, spending it is
[39:23] nonsensical. So, and then you've also
[39:26] got the the uh the quantum concern,
[39:29] which is if we had to shift all the the
[39:33] UTXOs into some form of quantum
[39:36] resistant um uh UTXO wallet account,
[39:40] whatever it is, um you've got to move
[39:43] the entirety of all uh all the
[39:48] information through a throughput that's
[39:50] very very small. it would take uh tens
[39:53] of years just to move all the bitcoin
[39:55] into more quantum resistant wallets. At
[39:58] that point, the inevitable task there
[40:01] would that that all wallets, you know,
[40:04] the majority of large holders will be
[40:06] able to shift through, but smaller
[40:08] holders maybe not. Uh but obviously
[40:10] there's a lot bigger problems in society
[40:13] of other sorts of systems such as
[40:15] nuclear launch codes and all those sorts
[40:16] of things that would probably be tried
[40:18] you know people trying to act not access
[40:20] but it's yeah there's there's all
[40:22] different it's all looking into the
[40:24] future looking in the past where we are
[40:26] today and but again I think what s what
[40:31] sustains that decentralization is the
[40:33] cost to run a node be uh the cost
[40:38] imperative is keep it down because uh we
[40:41] want we want that duplication of the
[40:43] number of nodes because one person
[40:46] stores the truth that's centralized. If
[40:50] thousand 10,000 100 thousand all have
[40:53] that same copy of that same file. Um we
[40:56] we're not all operating with
[40:58] abstractions. We've all got a shared
[40:59] reality to to coordinate society on. Um
[41:03] we've seen the degradation when when the
[41:05] quality of money declines. We're we're
[41:07] in the we're at the end of the debt
[41:09] money system in my view and
[41:11] transitioning us onto this new energy
[41:13] money system. Um the the settlement
[41:17] layer
[41:19] is the settlement layer is core. Um and
[41:24] how the layer twos and social layer 3es
[41:27] get built on that and how the mining
[41:28] interacts underneath that. Um it's it's
[41:31] like a it's like a game of chess. You
[41:33] don't really want to change the rules.
[41:35] you just want to make sure that the game
[41:36] is played fairly.
[41:38] Um, yeah,
[41:41] that is that is very true. Do you feel
[41:44] like there's um an sufficient amount of
[41:47] active full node runners that look over
[41:50] the network? Um, I haven't looked so
[41:53] deeply right now into the sort of I know
[41:55] there's people, places, and things that
[41:58] that measure the sorts of um the size,
[42:01] you know, if it's the prune node,
[42:02] partial node, all sorts of things. So
[42:04] I'm not too familiar in that department.
[42:07] But but again I think if people
[42:10] are if if learners of Bitcoin are
[42:14] engaging with these smaller components
[42:16] of the network which is a mini miner
[42:18] hardware wallet you know read write and
[42:20] own if you're writing in the blockchain
[42:22] with with hash rate going into ocean so
[42:25] having your own block templates in a
[42:27] sense it's very niche and small amounts
[42:29] but it's it's the effort the storing of
[42:33] your own data running your own node even
[42:36] adding lightning to that if you if you
[42:38] want to go that direction and then
[42:40] holding your own private keys. That that
[42:43] engagement of people to sort of step
[42:45] back from the the digital noise of
[42:48] everything in this world right now,
[42:49] hyperconumption society and and want to
[42:52] be more physically engaged and and also
[42:54] teaching kids if if we're always go to
[42:57] the youth teach them how to oh look this
[43:00] is a m this is a mini minor plug it into
[43:02] the power connected to the Wi-Fi. Oh,
[43:04] look. We're connected to this pool and
[43:05] look, I've put it I've connected it
[43:07] through, you know, a lightning layer 2,
[43:09] a lightning wallet. Oh, look. So, we're
[43:12] consuming energy. Oh, it's making this
[43:14] thing called hash rate and then flowing
[43:16] Bitcoin into a wallet. These sorts of
[43:18] pieces connect it all together.
[43:20] Otherwise, we're just lost in this soup
[43:22] of all these different technical topics
[43:25] in all different areas. But if we
[43:27] connect all the layers, engage people
[43:28] with mini miners that then want to run
[43:31] their own node and store their own
[43:32] bitcoin in their own wallet, it
[43:34] reconnects those three components of
[43:36] read, write, and own of the blockchain
[43:38] um to a to a point that we'll have more
[43:41] active participants that run a node
[43:44] because they're getting paid to add
[43:46] blocks to the chain in a sense and
[43:48] they're holding the money from being
[43:50] paid to add blocks. So, it just sort of
[43:52] rebalances the the economics of running
[43:55] a node. If you're being
[43:57] paid, yeah, you have to nine to
[43:59] participate in increasing the storage
[44:01] size of of your of your your node, so to
[44:04] speak. That's that that's the only way
[44:07] to introduce an economic incentive
[44:09] without miners in of themselves being
[44:10] paid to do so, which is not what we want
[44:12] because it would someone would spin up
[44:15] loads and loads and loads of versions of
[44:16] nodes um if there was some form of
[44:19] economic incentive to do so. It's that's
[44:21] where the compute aspect comes in. um
[44:23] the proof of work is is why the
[44:25] economics are distributed to anyone with
[44:27] an energy cost. So if there's someone
[44:30] involved in making having an energy cost
[44:32] with compute running their own uh node
[44:34] storing the data and earning the bitcoin
[44:37] and if that circular system of three
[44:40] people is down to each individual will
[44:43] have a lot more nodes because they've
[44:45] got the money to to continually scale
[44:48] out how much storage space they need.
[44:50] But you you can compare it to say Salana
[44:52] that's like 300 terabytes
[44:55] uh to run a node to to run a full
[44:57] archival node for Salana the the
[44:59] centralized blockchain that pauses which
[45:02] is it's absurd that only a handful of
[45:08] large um databases that data centers
[45:12] will be running that database. And it
[45:16] just means that everyday people that
[45:18] just go crypto crypto crypto and trade
[45:20] nonsensical coins uh and tokens that
[45:23] they're they're not engaged in those
[45:25] fundamentals. So it they're just
[45:27] gravitating towards a digital version of
[45:30] the very system we already have um today
[45:33] with with the debt debt money system.
[45:35] Bitcoin requires people to gravitate
[45:37] towards um sovereignty and and
[45:40] self-sufficiency and that that goes
[45:42] through all the layers. I love your
[45:44] framing or like your description of
[45:47] there is the depth money system and then
[45:49] there's the energy money system. I I I
[45:51] love that because we always say like oh
[45:53] sound money and uh fiat money but then
[45:56] you have to like explain that and and
[45:58] depth money system and energy money
[46:00] system. Uh at least for me it feels more
[46:02] tangible uh the the description of that.
[46:05] So it's it it makes for me uh at least
[46:07] for me a little little bit more sense.
[46:09] You also you are also really big on uh
[46:11] unit of account as a as a system. I I
[46:14] saw I think on your Twitter it's written
[46:17] um unit of building a unit of account of
[46:19] of Bitcoin. What what is that a focus
[46:21] like? Why why unit of account? Uh aren't
[46:24] we extremely far away from from that
[46:28] miners are the f the f well the first
[46:30] unit of account in my view is uh block
[46:34] space. Block space is you know uh blocks
[46:38] produce there's a certain amount of data
[46:40] space for transactions to be stored in
[46:42] that and it's a live market that your
[46:45] transaction will be pushed out of the
[46:46] next block if someone else pays a higher
[46:49] fee because those miners are trying to
[46:50] capture as much fees versus their
[46:52] energy. So what I try and observe
[46:55] Bitcoin as a unit of account which is
[46:57] measuring the quantity sorry measuring
[47:00] other things in a quantity of Bitcoin
[47:04] not a dollarized value of Bitcoin using
[47:06] Bitcoin as settlement but measuring
[47:07] other things and a quantity of Bitcoin.
[47:09] So the first thing is obviously block
[47:11] space that that's the first and foremost
[47:13] one. The second commodity on a Bitcoin
[47:16] unit account is electricity because
[47:18] miners can define their block space that
[47:21] they've produced versus that electricity
[47:23] that they've consumed and they are
[47:26] active. They're constantly measuring
[47:28] this quantity of electricity which is
[47:31] priced in. You got this quantity of
[47:32] electricity through a computer to
[47:35] produce a quantity of Bitcoin. And
[47:36] they're obviously trying to make uh the
[47:38] dollarized value of those quantities
[47:40] make sense which is you know spend
[47:42] $50,000 on electricity which is say is
[47:46] that a million kilowatt hours? I think
[47:48] it is um to produce the $100,000
[47:50] Bitcoin. And so their economic value of
[47:54] those kilowatt hours is the the amount
[47:56] of Bitcoin they can produce. So that you
[47:59] strip the dollar bits away and you've
[48:01] just got quantity of kilowatt hours
[48:02] versus a quantity of Bitcoin. And so
[48:04] they will want to sell the electricity
[48:08] uh in Bitcoin per kilowatt hour at
[48:10] greater value than what they could mine.
[48:12] And so that creates a world where miners
[48:15] are buying energy below the Bitcoin per
[48:19] kilowatt hour rate and they are selling
[48:22] it above the Bitcoin per kilowatt hour
[48:24] rate. So they're naturally creating this
[48:26] market force of selling the price of
[48:28] energy to Bitcoin per kilowatt hour and
[48:30] buying the energy up to Bitcoin per
[48:32] kilowatt hour. And thus I believe that
[48:34] that the next commodity beyond block
[48:37] space to be on a Bitcoin unit account is
[48:40] electricity. And then you go, okay, what
[48:44] what does electricity plug
[48:46] into? Everything. We've got the whole
[48:49] transportation system that's just
[48:51] pushing, you know, the landside um
[48:54] pushing into electrical vehicles. So I
[48:58] do believe there'll be a point you, you
[49:00] know, pull up to the in American gas
[49:02] station. um not anymore and you'll see
[49:06] Bitcoin per kilowatt hour as that rate
[49:08] because now think of the businesses that
[49:10] operate in such a space that you've got
[49:14] uh people running an electric car
[49:17] charging uh electric station and they
[49:20] are their business is to sell
[49:23] electricity that that they buy it from
[49:26] the grid at volume wholesale and sell it
[49:28] to cars coming in retail and obviously
[49:31] the subsidies from from the governments
[49:33] are messing up that that economics that
[49:35] these are industries that we do want
[49:38] because there's going to be people that
[49:39] want electric cars and the volume of
[49:41] cars and if their business is selling
[49:45] electricity, what's to stop them running
[49:48] Bitcoin miners with the electric car
[49:50] charging? Use the heat from the machines
[49:53] to sustain the temperatures of the
[49:55] tarmac underneath the cars in the cold
[49:57] environments. run it into a sauna, into
[49:59] a lingerie. The the fragmentation of the
[50:02] different connections that Bitcoin
[50:03] mining has into other industries now
[50:05] that you've got electricity priced in
[50:08] Bitcoin, it it goes into all different
[50:10] ways. But if they now are observing,
[50:12] okay, we can sell electricity to cars
[50:15] coming into charge and also this these
[50:17] computers that that turn it into money,
[50:20] um they will want to sell the power at
[50:23] the same rate or slightly higher than
[50:25] what they can turn into Bitcoin. So that
[50:27] energy rate naturally descends on on the
[50:30] bitcoin per kilowatt hour rate which is
[50:32] priced in uh block rewards which is
[50:34] going to inevitably just be solely the
[50:36] fee market. And so with electricity
[50:40] priced in a bitcoin unit of account
[50:42] which feeds into all of the inputs of so
[50:44] of society you know we've come off a
[50:46] debt oil petrod dollarbased money system
[50:49] into an energy based electricitybased
[50:51] currency system which does have some
[50:53] very interesting historical context of
[50:56] Thomas Edison and Henry Ford
[50:58] conceptualizing the idea of an
[51:00] energybased currency to stop wars and
[51:02] debase gold as a monetary reserve which
[51:04] was I think was it 1921 I believe The
[51:08] article is uh place called Muscle
[51:10] Scholes where they wanted to essentially
[51:12] use the power of a hydropower dam to
[51:14] create some energy unit um and use that
[51:17] as a as a currency system. And so the
[51:20] history is there for energy based money
[51:22] all the way back. But uh electric Yeah.
[51:26] The the infrastructure of today is the
[51:28] electrical grid and the internet. And
[51:32] everything on the finance side sits on
[51:34] the internet of everything on the energy
[51:35] side is the electrical grid. And Bitcoin
[51:38] mining can turn energy into money off
[51:41] the grid when things can't connect to
[51:43] the grid, which is build a new uh wind
[51:46] farm and you need to join the queue to
[51:49] to wait x amount of years to get
[51:51] connected to sell your power. So, you're
[51:53] a you're a business that sells power.
[51:56] Um, if you can't get connected to the
[51:58] the power market, you need someone else
[52:00] to step in and and monetize your power.
[52:03] So, you can be anywhere on the
[52:05] planet, anywhere in anywhere. Yeah.
[52:07] Anywhere in space, anywhere in time
[52:09] because there's always a block to be
[52:11] mined. Um, and then you've got this this
[52:13] energy money that that connects it all
[52:16] together. And that pricing system is
[52:18] across everyone. So, I do believe people
[52:21] will be in the middle of the middle of
[52:22] the jungle that they truly their their
[52:25] goal in life is to completely disconnect
[52:27] from society, but they'll still be
[52:29] connected because they'll still be able
[52:31] to mine their own Bitcoin. Um, and just
[52:34] like the way that California developed
[52:37] into a massive nation in of itself, it's
[52:39] like a large economy.
[52:42] um from gold, natural wealth being found
[52:44] in that local level and gold went out,
[52:47] goods, services, resources, businesses,
[52:50] industries came in. And so if we've now
[52:53] got this new monetary system that is is
[52:56] uh California on steroids, which is
[52:59] wherever there's energy abundance in the
[53:01] world, um mining will gravitate there,
[53:05] build out infrastructure, build out
[53:07] their own energy systems and build out
[53:10] their own my hope is they build out
[53:11] their own communities of people that
[53:12] want to live anywhere and anywhere
[53:14] that's that can capture power like some
[53:17] hydropower dam in the middle of nowhere
[53:18] that the industry's left and how you
[53:21] know a community could be there. And
[53:23] then you've got this energy pricing
[53:24] system where if you live in the middle
[53:26] of nowhere, you're still going to want
[53:27] to be connected to the internet to to
[53:29] play whatever video game you play. Um
[53:32] you still want to participate with
[53:34] society, which is money needs to go in
[53:36] one direction from your local place that
[53:39] you've produced it with your mining and
[53:41] goods and services come to you. So we've
[53:42] got established logistics and supply
[53:45] chains for everything. Um, and now we
[53:48] have a form of digital hard global money
[53:50] that enemies can trade and yeah, it it
[53:54] just solves it all. It's a it's a
[53:56] pricing system and it
[53:59] democratizes it democratizes that
[54:01] pricing system as well because more hash
[54:03] rate joins the more electricity your
[54:06] Bitcoin buys. So there's there's a few
[54:08] pieces to it but I'll try and keep it
[54:10] simple.
[54:13] It was very good explained and the the
[54:16] question I always ask and and I'm 100%
[54:19] with you that we will get to that point
[54:21] where Bitcoin is a unit of account of of
[54:24] basically everything and you do a really
[54:26] good um job in explaining why and how
[54:29] this this whole thing works. What do you
[54:31] think is the implication of that when we
[54:33] have now a base money that is
[54:37] deflationary or disinflationary in in
[54:40] nature and not inflationary? People seem
[54:43] to be so focused already on oh I get a
[54:46] salary increase every year. Oh, I the
[54:49] the food gets more costly every year.
[54:52] What if this whole thing flips where uh
[54:55] you you might get salary decreases every
[54:57] year but still have more purchasing
[54:59] power because your salary decreases
[55:01] slower than your banana costs. Huh.
[55:06] Um, I think people, well, I have an
[55:10] interesting theory that the difficulty
[55:11] adjustment will probably be something to
[55:14] use as an aggregate to repric people's
[55:17] employment contracts because the
[55:19] difficulty adjustment is a
[55:20] representation of how much energy is in
[55:22] the system because you've got more
[55:24] mining producing sorry more energy to
[55:27] produce more compute which produces more
[55:30] blocks in a relative time period. So,
[55:32] difficulty increases. So the difficulty
[55:34] adjustment is the software of the
[55:37] network understanding how much compute
[55:39] is trying to brute force add more blocks
[55:41] to the chain which is how much hash rate
[55:44] is being produced which the average
[55:46] efficiency of the network gives us an
[55:48] understanding how much energy is in the
[55:50] system and the um what was your question
[55:54] again? I wonder um what the implications
[55:58] of that is. What is the implications of
[56:00] of of uh having Bitcoin as a unit of
[56:02] account? So in a in the the deflationary
[56:06] aspect, you've got the fixed supply 21
[56:08] million units with energy expanding,
[56:11] compute expanding, dollar expanding,
[56:14] nodes expanding. We hope all those
[56:16] things expanding under these units. So
[56:17] obviously everything is getting repriced
[56:21] against the quantity of sats trending to
[56:23] zero never reaching there. Um and in
[56:26] deflationary terms like well
[56:29] inflationary terms if you sign an
[56:31] employment contract you're saying that
[56:33] my 40 hours this week my time and energy
[56:36] is worth this quantity of units and then
[56:38] you go and use those units to buy a
[56:40] quantity of goods and services. And the
[56:43] the the key thing that everyone needs to
[56:45] understand that's not really in Bitcoin
[56:48] is that money you have to look through
[56:49] the money that you're working in
[56:53] exchange of other people's time and
[56:54] energy as well that you're accessing
[56:56] other people's goods and services on the
[56:57] other side of that money because what do
[56:59] you do? You earn it and then you spend
[57:00] it on energy bills and and living and
[57:04] rent and and all these sorts of things.
[57:06] And the the slippage in that system for
[57:10] inflationary money is you earn it in
[57:12] quantity with your time and energy. And
[57:15] then that quantity of money buys you
[57:17] less over time. So somewhere between the
[57:19] hard work that you provided the world
[57:22] and the time that you spend it, it it
[57:25] erodess. The the hamburgers get smaller
[57:27] and more expensive. And those are the
[57:30] those are the the concerns of an
[57:32] inflationary money system.
[57:35] um which redistri you know if more units
[57:38] in the middle are printed on your side
[57:40] of time and energy versus buying someone
[57:41] else's time and energy. If the units get
[57:44] inflated it's um in like a business
[57:48] person's perspective it's they get if
[57:50] we're all getting share we're getting
[57:51] diluted shares of the collective
[57:54] purchasing power of of the dollar or the
[57:56] pound or the euro and where do those new
[57:59] units those new shares go? they go to
[58:02] inefficient causes um and and and gross
[58:06] inefficiency.
[58:07] Bitcoin the the amount of the full cap
[58:11] is 21 million where the 20 I can't
[58:13] remember the exact supply at the moment
[58:15] circulating but these units are being
[58:17] distributed to the most efficient in
[58:19] society versus government which can be
[58:22] argued as one of the most inefficient in
[58:24] society and so to start with is okay the
[58:27] monetary units are being distributed to
[58:29] those most efficient with their energy
[58:31] and compute that's the start the base
[58:33] layer and then people are buying it at a
[58:36] dollar to bitcoin exchange change rates.
[58:37] That's a clear the Bitcoin price is
[58:40] essentially a clear comparison between
[58:41] the two systems. And Bitcoin to
[58:45] production is representative of how
[58:47] efficient you are, how cheaply you can
[58:50] acquire your Bitcoin. And when it comes
[58:53] to the deflationary use of that money
[58:55] the so I've covered the part where we're
[58:58] earning it which is the miners in
[59:00] whichever quantity based in your energy
[59:02] costs and then to go to spend it is or
[59:06] even the salary aspect is yeah is if
[59:08] difficulty has increased 10% where it's
[59:11] because the network hash rate increased
[59:13] by 10%. Which means roughly 10% more
[59:16] energy has entered the network. And if
[59:19] all those things have have happened, it
[59:21] means that the value of
[59:23] Bitcoin in electricity terms has
[59:26] increased to 10%. And we'll buy 10% more
[59:29] electricity. So if the units that you've
[59:32] signed a contract to earn in time and
[59:34] energy has increased in value by 10%,
[59:37] maybe you should make take a pay cut by
[59:39] 10%. And so that's the theory behind
[59:41] maybe the difficulty adjustment where in
[59:44] the future someone will have an
[59:45] employment contract to say that their
[59:47] time and energy is worth this quantity
[59:49] of energy money units. But if the energy
[59:52] value of the the units change, the
[59:54] difficulty adjustment is our key key
[59:57] metric of that planetary scale
[59:59] understanding of what the true value of
[60:01] Bitcoin is underneath the dollar debt
[60:03] based money system that we are moving
[60:05] away from. So everything to do with unit
[60:07] of account has to address the
[60:10] fundamentals of Bitcoin and obviously
[60:12] the difficulty adjustment is the key
[60:13] regulator there.
[60:16] It makes a lot of sense and I love your
[60:18] explanations
[60:20] man. It's very unique how how how you go
[60:23] about and and and tell me things. I
[60:25] could be right, I could be wrong but I
[60:27] just look beyond the anything with a
[60:30] dollar in it that's not fundamental. you
[60:33] have to go um deeper and and I'm trying
[60:37] to ensure that the education addresses
[60:39] that where we do understand you know
[60:41] even with the initial discussions of of
[60:43] return is what will happen in the past
[60:46] where we where we are at today and where
[60:48] are we going in the future and we can
[60:50] understand subsidy disappears so it's
[60:53] the fee rate of blocks uh blocks smaller
[60:56] bigger well that imposes costs on the
[60:58] nodes uh but miners have more block
[61:00] space to sell but we don't want too much
[61:03] power to the miners because you
[61:04] mentioned the centralization aspects.
[61:06] There's we have this delicate dance of
[61:09] these three core groups that are mostly
[61:13] the same person but there is there is
[61:16] this sort of fragmentation where there's
[61:17] a large group of people just sitting on
[61:19] piles of Bitcoin but they're not
[61:21] actively participated in the network. On
[61:23] the flip side, the more Bitcoin that's
[61:26] being held and not circulated and
[61:29] settled in blocks, so if 99% of Bitcoin
[61:32] sat in wallets and never moved, there's
[61:34] only 1% in relative terms being priced
[61:37] against all the energy of the network,
[61:39] which reprices the 99% against all of
[61:42] that energy in much greater quantity.
[61:45] But if it doesn't s the circulation has
[61:48] to has to sustain but too much
[61:51] circulation and everything gets
[61:52] expensive and not enough circulation
[61:55] and the it's just this this interplay of
[61:58] energy and finance that's truly sort of
[62:01] made me obsessed with with hash power um
[62:04] and all I can do is push out education
[62:07] with what I know is fundamental
[62:09] um and also understand um where I could
[62:13] be right where I could be wrong I don't
[62:14] know. Um, but at least push out good
[62:18] knowledge cuz that's I've sat on these
[62:20] ideas for uh a good year. And it's not
[62:25] to say I was going to talk about them
[62:27] and and then have
[62:29] um I don't know everything you want is
[62:32] on the other side of fear is is a is a
[62:34] valuable quote that I think people
[62:36] should live by that if if you want to
[62:38] speak on things, speak about it. If you
[62:40] waiting on someone to call you, just
[62:42] call them. If they don't, fool you once,
[62:44] fool you twice. But um yeah, there's
[62:46] there's all with Bitcoin, there's just
[62:48] so much looking at every aspect of
[62:51] questioning everything. Um but it truly
[62:54] has to come back down to the individual.
[62:56] I love the message of uh the things you
[62:58] want is beyond the wall of fear
[63:00] basically. Yeah. Uh just to give maybe
[63:03] you context, I talked about it already
[63:06] sometimes on the podcast. Um, I was in
[63:09] school uh so bad that I almost failed in
[63:12] German and I failed in English through
[63:15] German school. So I had to repeat a
[63:18] class there. Uh and not when I was like
[63:21] 12 but when I was like uh 17 years old.
[63:24] Uh so it was not uh that uh that that
[63:27] early and then um uh I had an extreme
[63:31] amount of fear for any presentation like
[63:33] I I got ran up the the the gin and uh
[63:38] ever since then I think like 18 or 19 I
[63:41] I realized that it would be really bad
[63:44] for me in my life if I keep having that
[63:46] fear and I learned that just going a
[63:49] little bit in in that fear helps to
[63:52] decrease that fear from that and the
[63:54] podcast is just a product of me trying
[63:57] the best to deal with that fear. And
[63:59] funny enough, now I earn my money just
[64:02] by speaking about Bitcoin. So the very
[64:06] much the the thing that I was most
[64:07] afraid of at like 18 17 years old uh is
[64:11] now the thing that earns me money. So I
[64:13] don't know maybe this is a small context
[64:14] to what you said. That's amazing. And um
[64:18] it's it's I think one of the key
[64:20] takeaways in terms of even Bitcoin in of
[64:22] itself is just the paradox that um I
[64:27] I've definitely had a few presentations
[64:29] where the stomach goes into a knot. But
[64:32] um I I've I've always I think I've been
[64:36] sort of quite paradoxical um in the
[64:38] sense of that when your stomach's in
[64:42] turmoil about something that you're
[64:44] about to do that you know is right to do
[64:47] such as a presentation you want to do
[64:48] well. You want to get a good grade
[64:50] whatever it is.
[64:52] Um when you when you get that worrisome
[64:55] feeling in your stomach about doing
[64:56] something right you just have to you
[64:59] just have to do it. and and yeah,
[65:03] everything he wants on the other side of
[65:04] fear. It's it's um it's truly it comes
[65:06] down to that cuz we live in a society
[65:09] where um certain events of health and
[65:13] those sorts of things that happened say
[65:15] 5 years ago they've created this society
[65:19] that has ever buried their head in the
[65:22] internet in a large scale. There's, you
[65:23] know, there's always people that go out
[65:25] and live their lives, say on the digital
[65:27] on the physical side of things, but
[65:29] there's a lot of people that are just um
[65:31] blackboxed and and and live their life
[65:33] in a very digital um so connected but
[65:37] disconnected way. And um yeah, so all I
[65:42] can say is anyone that's wishing to take
[65:44] some step in life that that that knows
[65:47] is going to give them forward momentum,
[65:49] just do it. just uh just take that leap
[65:54] 100% I agree with you. Um, we have a we
[65:58] have one question that I ask each and
[65:59] every one of my guests. Uh, and the
[66:01] question is, what can we learn from you
[66:03] besides
[66:06] Bitcoin?
[66:09] Uh, personal development, but I also
[66:13] attest that I'm on my own personal
[66:14] development journey just like everyone
[66:16] is throughout life. um that we are all
[66:18] just sort of shards of the same
[66:20] consciousness sort of learning itself
[66:24] and bit Bitcoin comes into that
[66:26] obviously but um we're we're all just
[66:30] observers of of Bitcoin when it comes to
[66:33] the sort of personal development side
[66:34] I've I've um I've been surrounded by
[66:37] people that that value health fitness
[66:39] well-being
[66:41] u yoga anything that is trying to create
[66:44] alignment for people in life which is We
[66:47] the fiat money system has created this
[66:50] gross distortion of people's actions and
[66:52] consequences. This world of buy now, pay
[66:54] later. It's uh get what you want now,
[66:57] but everything you have to pay in the
[66:59] consequences of it is later with
[67:01] interest. And that has truly hurt a lot
[67:04] of people. And so even even the you know
[67:08] the only way to change the world is to
[67:09] change the nations, change the towns,
[67:11] change the village, change the family,
[67:14] change yourself. And it doesn't work
[67:16] from big to small. It starts from small
[67:18] to big. You have to change yourself.
[67:20] Help your family, help the village, help
[67:23] the town, help the city, help the
[67:24] country, help the world. And and um to
[67:27] every individual in Bitcoin, we all are
[67:30] coordinated with this, you know, chain
[67:32] of truth, the blockchain. And uh on the
[67:35] personal development side, that's you
[67:37] know, that's the first step is uh look
[67:40] within, focus on yourself, and then it
[67:43] expands expands out to that. So yeah,
[67:45] that's the key takeaway for me. What
[67:49] really really nice um we have end in the
[67:51] podcast where the previous guest is
[67:53] asking a question for the next guest
[67:54] without knowing who the next guest
[67:56] actually is? And the question is so cool
[67:59] and it was never asked actually in
[68:00] almost 500 episodes. Wow. Uh the
[68:03] question for you is was the fall of Rome
[68:06] as cringe as the fall of the west
[68:09] currently? If you say that the fall of
[68:11] Rome is as
[68:13] cringe as the fall of the western
[68:17] civilization currently.
[68:22] Um I think
[68:24] the what's the uh the old saying it's if
[68:28] you don't learn history you're doomed to
[68:29] repeat it.
[68:32] that there is this belief that Bitcoin
[68:35] can be the finality of um a monetary
[68:38] system that that as much as people try
[68:41] and manipulate the you know brute force
[68:44] digital mother nature um keeps
[68:46] everything in check and the the nodes
[68:49] being the the guardians of such
[68:51] responsibility. Um, and when it comes to
[68:55] the whole Rome aspect of things, there's
[68:57] still that sort of um, expansionism of
[69:01] of Rome and and how far it got as to the
[69:05] sort of politicking of of those in the
[69:08] power structure in Rome itself.
[69:13] And
[69:15] cringe, I don't know. Um, I'm not fully
[69:19] sure. I'm not I think I need a lot more
[69:22] knowledge on both. Um but the key thing
[69:24] is that I think I think those that have
[69:28] studied
[69:29] um the fall of Rome and even to the
[69:32] societal degradation that we see today
[69:35] um you know obsessions with gender,
[69:38] obsessions with uh you know throwing
[69:41] money and and the culture, the music,
[69:43] the everything. I think um societal rot
[69:47] just gets shown in everything and that's
[69:50] why you go to the fundamentals and look
[69:51] for the root causes of things and I very
[69:54] much concluded as an engineer who uh as
[69:57] a job role I went into risk management
[70:00] so it's just understanding how systems
[70:02] break and we just see a society right
[70:05] now that's just continually breaking
[70:07] eroding giving you less but requiring
[70:10] more and all that misalignment starts
[70:12] with one thing and one thing only and
[70:13] It's our unit of measure for everything
[70:16] in in life life and love and living is
[70:20] broken. Debt based money is broken and
[70:23] we need to fix it. So yeah, we we here
[70:27] to fix the broken monetary system and uh
[70:30] hopefully we can educate a few a few
[70:34] people on this. You're doing a really
[70:35] great job on explaining complex topics
[70:38] and on um breaking it down so we can
[70:42] understand it. Thank you so much for
[70:44] that.
[70:45] Yeah, appreciate it. Before I let you
[70:48] go, um, where can people find you, ask
[70:50] you questions, and reach out to you? I
[70:51] think you also have a YouTube channel.
[70:53] Yes. So, it's hash power academy, which
[70:56] is both the YouTube channel and the the
[70:59] the website
[71:01] hashpower.academy. There is a free
[71:03] course where anything and everything to
[71:05] do with Bitcoin is all this jumbled mess
[71:07] of topics. And I spent an entire summer
[71:10] trying to just put them in order from
[71:13] from the watts that we produce from all
[71:15] different power sources to electrical
[71:17] grid to the hardware to the hash rate to
[71:19] the blockchain to the bitcoin taught as
[71:21] money last free course. Um and then I
[71:24] also have a business arm which is
[71:27] terraash.inance which uh I'll talk about
[71:29] at another time. Yes. Um yeah that's it.
[71:34] Terraashf has this something to do with
[71:36] the terraash uh in in Germany the
[71:38] company interestingly no um an
[71:42] interesting parallel but u no I see the
[71:45] sort of financialization of compute
[71:47] power being this is right at the end now
[71:50] uh I don't think Bitcoin bonds as they
[71:53] are today are anything other than a
[71:55] marketing gimmick because the Bitcoin
[71:57] bonds that the guys in Wall Street are
[71:59] talking about are US-based dollarized is
[72:03] debt to buy Bitcoin. That is not a
[72:05] Bitcoin bond. A Bitcoin bond is the
[72:08] forward delivery of Bitcoin in the
[72:10] future. What provides that? It's it's
[72:13] hash rate. And so the financialization
[72:15] of hash rate goes into all different
[72:17] sorts of assets and and commodification
[72:19] of it uh financialization of it which is
[72:22] I I feel like that Bitcoin's banking
[72:26] system is is obviously the miners but
[72:28] there's there's other interesting things
[72:30] contracts
[72:31] um even a carbon credit so sort of yeah
[72:35] just the way that I teach Bitcoin
[72:38] um isn't just education but it's also
[72:40] where I've built a knowledge of all the
[72:43] mathematical and physical, the maths and
[72:45] physics of Bitcoin, interconnecting
[72:47] multiple different commodities
[72:49] altogether and then building a financial
[72:51] architecture on top of that and
[72:53] producing actual Bitcoin bonds, not um
[72:57] not the garbage that Wall Street's
[72:58] trying to promote right now. Yeah, topic
[73:01] for another day. You wouldn't believe
[73:03] how many different topics I had in my
[73:05] mind today of talking and we I didn't
[73:08] even touch a little bit. So, I think we
[73:10] have uh room for a second, third, and
[73:12] fourth round on the podcast with you. Uh
[73:15] thank you so much for for being on. And
[73:17] also, thank you so much for everyone
[73:18] that is watching and listening, for
[73:20] joining us today. As always, I'll be
[73:23] back tomorrow with another episode.
[73:24] Bye-bye.
