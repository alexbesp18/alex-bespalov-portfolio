[00:00] two more sort of bull cycles it would be
[00:02] reasonable that the top would be
[00:03] somewhere between 1 and 10 million per
[00:05] Bitcoin in today's dollars the main
[00:06] thing that it does is fix all the
[00:08] incentives that surround everything and
[00:09] just about anything that sucks in the
[00:10] world right now is a product of
[00:12] misaligned incentives the Bitcoin price
[00:14] that you might be able to guess could
[00:16] happen with Camala Harris regime doesn't
[00:18] really have a talk because she might end
[00:20] the United States within her first
[00:21] four-year term if she gets in I think
[00:23] all bets are off on the price of Bitcoin
[00:25] it removes the ability of the state to
[00:27] tax us through our savings but but it's
[00:30] also protecting us from a different kind
[00:32] of violence from the state which is the
[00:34] the sort of 60102 effect man with a gun
[00:36] has to look you in the eyes now because
[00:38] Bitcoin exists we're kind of in an
[00:39] interesting spot as Canadians because we
[00:43] have maybe the most incompetent
[00:44] government in the world I've definitely
[00:46] seen a bunch of them have left we have
[00:48] fewer really good quality Canadian
[00:49] bitcoiners than we did four years ago
[00:51] Trump is elected our bitcoin price will
[00:53] be somewhere between 20,000 and 300,000
[00:55] us within his term we'll probably be in
[00:58] a scenario where there are six or seven
[01:00] currencies in the world 5 years from now
[01:02] and at some point all of them will enter
[01:04] that death spiral the United States
[01:06] dollar should probably end up being the
[01:07] last to die given its Reserve status and
[01:10] all the ETFs Black Rock Etc all of micro
[01:13] strategies coins are all sitting in
[01:14] coinbase the chances that the coinbase
[01:17] will hand those coins over to the United
[01:19] States government in their entirety are
[01:21] 100% just a matter of
[01:26] time why does Bitcoin fix everything
[01:30] yeah um broadly it comes down to
[01:33] incentives I mean there's a lot of a lot
[01:35] of ways that Bitcoin is a useful tool it
[01:38] helps with the energy industry it helps
[01:40] with the payments industry it can it can
[01:41] be useful in those ways but at the core
[01:44] the main thing that it does is fix all
[01:45] the incentives that surround everything
[01:48] and when you drill down to it you can
[01:51] pick a problem in the world and just
[01:53] about anything that sucks in the world
[01:55] right now is a product of misaligned
[01:57] incentives and so in most cases what's
[02:00] going on is not just the problem of the
[02:02] debasement of the currency you know the
[02:04] government is printing the money to
[02:06] spend the money the problem is that
[02:08] they're actually spending it in ways
[02:09] that make our lives worse they're
[02:11] creating all of these perverse
[02:12] incentives around literally every area
[02:14] of society which is pretty much where
[02:16] they have their fingers into at this
[02:18] point is everything and when they spend
[02:21] money they tend to make things worse
[02:23] rather than better in almost every
[02:25] single aspect of of Our Lives super
[02:27] interesting yeah because when when you
[02:28] really come down to it it's like when
[02:31] you think about a problem that you want
[02:32] to solve I don't know like a big one
[02:34] like I don't know murdering or or
[02:36] something like that you in the first for
[02:39] Bitcoin cannot solve it but if you
[02:40] really align the incentives and every
[02:43] human has the incentive to work with
[02:45] each other and if I work for something
[02:47] nice in the Bitcoin community and I save
[02:50] everything in Bitcoin that benefits you
[02:52] because I save it in
[02:54] Bitcoin that's an that's an amazing mind
[02:57] shift uh uh to make but that's probably
[03:00] only true once we reach like hyper
[03:04] bitcoinz world like that that's only
[03:07] when we actually are in in the Bitcoin
[03:10] World already or is is Bitcoin fixing
[03:12] things before that already yeah I mean
[03:15] Bitcoin is already fixing a lot of
[03:17] things but it's mostly fixing things for
[03:19] individuals right now it's not really
[03:21] fixing the systemic stuff so when when
[03:25] you talk about the example of murder um
[03:27] or like violent crime more broadly there
[03:30] is supposed to be a disincentive
[03:32] provided by the state to those kind of
[03:35] behaviors right and that's kind of the
[03:37] core of what the state is supposed to be
[03:38] is this mechanism that we've we've we've
[03:41] hired a service provider to protect us
[03:44] we've hired them to provide the
[03:45] protection of physical safety and
[03:47] property rights and a big part of the
[03:49] reason that the the violent crime
[03:52] epidemic has been sweeping you know
[03:54] major cities all around the world is
[03:56] because they're no longer providing that
[03:58] incentive that is really supposed to be
[03:59] the core of what the state provides and
[04:02] so right out front we're missing what
[04:05] should be a key incentive because the
[04:06] money that is supposed to be being spent
[04:08] on crime is being spent on painted
[04:10] sidewalks and whatever else the the
[04:12] state decides we need more than safe
[04:15] cities and on the flip side which I
[04:19] think goes to your your bigger question
[04:22] um you know part of the reason that
[04:25] people resort to crime in general and
[04:27] especially violent crime is because the
[04:29] world world is not working out for them
[04:31] right and so when people are finding a
[04:32] hard time making ends meat when they
[04:34] can't they can't feed their family
[04:36] because their income is being inflated
[04:38] away and the cost of food and shelters
[04:40] going through the roof the incentives
[04:42] for violence go up and so in the long
[04:46] term that's how Bitcoin fixes violent
[04:48] crime is by removing the incentives for
[04:50] violent crime and returning us to a
[04:53] position where we have the the proper
[04:56] incent proper disincentives to violent
[04:58] crime and
[05:00] that big picture I think only happens
[05:02] when we get to that hyperbitcoinization
[05:04] level but at the individual level it's
[05:06] already doing that and all of us
[05:08] bitcoiners are examples of that where
[05:10] you know we've been in a large part
[05:13] sheltered from the storm of
[05:15] inflation that has hit most of the
[05:17] western world because we've got Bitcoin
[05:21] and so our incentives to violence are
[05:24] not going up the same way that other
[05:26] people's incentives are interesting so
[05:29] that's really interesting when we think
[05:31] about that but let's come to right now
[05:35] like let's come to what what an
[05:37] individual has that is adopting Bitcoin
[05:40] right now what is bitcoin protecting us
[05:43] against on an individual level who is
[05:45] adopting Bitcoin right now yeah I mean
[05:48] immediately it's protecting us against
[05:50] the debasement of our spending power so
[05:53] it it removes the ability of the state
[05:55] to tax us through our savings and
[06:00] that I think is the the single biggest
[06:02] thing but it's also protecting us from a
[06:04] different kind of violence from the
[06:06] state which is the the sort of 60102
[06:09] effect the idea that the state might
[06:11] take our money at some point at gunpoint
[06:13] and so in the long term Bitcoin will
[06:16] make it a lot harder for them to do that
[06:18] and if if they are going to 6102 the
[06:20] general population to decide that they
[06:22] want to seize everyone's Bitcoin it's
[06:25] it's a very direct seizure of wealth
[06:27] right they have to come to your door
[06:29] kick in the
[06:30] door find your seed words Etc and that
[06:34] is something that I think is a lot less
[06:36] palatable to the population in general
[06:38] than the way that they're taking that
[06:40] value right now which is just by
[06:41] printing more money to spend and so the
[06:44] way that I've put it is the man with a
[06:45] gun has to look you in the eyes now
[06:47] because Bitcoin exists and so those two
[06:50] things I think are are are big ways that
[06:52] bitcoiners are being protected the the
[06:54] next one that that can't be overstated
[06:56] and we've had personal experience with
[06:57] that in Canada is the censorship
[06:59] resistance
[07:00] right we're we're moving into an area
[07:01] with this rise of c
[07:03] dbc's and uh and different kinds of
[07:05] digital currencies that um I think most
[07:08] people can see will inevitably lead to
[07:11] an extra layer of both censorship and
[07:14] surveillance and Bitcoin is a way to opt
[07:16] out of both of those problems as well I
[07:19] think it's a cbcs are a real big danger
[07:22] I feel like uh for Humanity and people
[07:25] that living in a jurisdiction that are
[07:27] rolling out those digital currencies now
[07:30] it goes like it seems to be like a new
[07:32] trend that they actually call themselves
[07:33] just like digital Euro uh because that's
[07:36] probably how they how they will sell it
[07:39] uh in a better way is it also could it
[07:41] also be at that point a risk for Bitcoin
[07:44] or is that point already reached that we
[07:48] we don't have that risk from cbdcs
[07:50] anymore no I don't think it's a risk I
[07:52] think it actually in the short term um
[07:55] essentially what we're talking about
[07:56] when we're talking about these
[07:57] currencies is just improving the Fe
[07:59] payment rails and at least in Canada and
[08:02] the US where I have more experience the
[08:03] Fiat payment rails are actually a major
[08:05] impediment to bitcoin businesses so when
[08:08] we take payment for Bitcoin when we take
[08:10] Fiat we engage in a whole bunch of risks
[08:12] because of the fact that those payments
[08:13] are ultimately reversible they're very
[08:15] prone to fraud and they're very slow and
[08:17] so a a central bank digital currency
[08:19] would actually be really useful for
[08:21] Bitcoin exchanges but not really for
[08:24] anyone else and I think I think we've
[08:26] seen enough backlash against the acronym
[08:29] the Central Bank digital currencies that
[08:31] we're going to see most of the
[08:32] governments of the world dropping the
[08:33] idea at least in so many words um we've
[08:37] seen that from the Bank of Canada
[08:38] recently they've said that they're
[08:40] they're no longer pursuing a central
[08:41] bank digital currency and instead we'll
[08:43] be focusing on improving our settlement
[08:45] rails and really like there's not much
[08:48] of a difference there because all of our
[08:50] currency already digital right like your
[08:52] your dollars or your your Euros they sit
[08:55] in a in a database in a bank and all
[08:58] that we're talking about is moving that
[08:59] database to the central bank which in
[09:03] theory gets them a little bit closer to
[09:04] that transaction volume and allows them
[09:06] more power over censorship and and uh
[09:09] and surveillance but in reality it's not
[09:11] really changing anything right it's
[09:12] still all digital and so I think what
[09:14] we're going to see now is them
[09:15] abandoning the acronym and they're going
[09:18] to do try and do the same thing just by
[09:22] um positioning it as a payments
[09:23] Improvement which you know we don't need
[09:26] the central banks to do that if you
[09:27] think about the way that Banks all over
[09:29] the world do these like T plus2
[09:31] settlements takes two days to clear
[09:33] something like there's not a single
[09:36] other area of the world that takes two
[09:38] days to clear a piece of digital
[09:39] information right like the banks could
[09:42] have been doing this with with existing
[09:44] technology without any blockchains
[09:45] without any extra mess they could have
[09:47] been doing this in the 90s they could
[09:49] have been doing instant settlement and
[09:52] the the technology is is certainly there
[09:54] right you wouldn't you wouldn't find it
[09:56] acceptable that you go to watch a movie
[09:57] on Netflix and it's like okay you can
[09:59] watch this in two days once it gets
[10:01] there right like and if a movie can get
[10:03] there immediately then certainly a
[10:05] digital entry in a database can get
[10:07] there immediately and so really I think
[10:09] what they're going to be trying to do is
[10:11] provide us as consumers with a bribe and
[10:13] say we're going to take the system that
[10:14] that deliberately sucks and it sucks
[10:17] because the the Banks Banks keep it that
[10:19] way because they want to keep the money
[10:20] for the extra two days right and so that
[10:23] will be the bribe is that we can do this
[10:25] safer faster digital payment settlement
[10:28] system but but the the the the downside
[10:32] to that bribe will be that the
[10:33] government gets all that information and
[10:34] can much more directly
[10:36] freeze accounts using you know whatever
[10:39] emergency Powers they give themselves at
[10:41] the
[10:42] time I feel like it's uh the whole
[10:45] digital currency thing is is just a way
[10:47] to extend the life of of the Fiat F fat
[10:51] world it's like giving them another
[10:53] another breath before the eventual
[10:56] collapse yeah and I I feel like there
[10:58] there might be angle there as well where
[11:01] you know the way that the way that
[11:02] central banks create money is this like
[11:04] fairly messy
[11:06] multi-layered machine that kind of
[11:09] obfuscates the fact that they are in
[11:10] fact creating money and that's not
[11:12] something that most people see when they
[11:13] see you know government bonds being
[11:16] issued they don't think about that as
[11:17] the creation of money but it is and I
[11:20] think a central bank digital currency or
[11:23] essentially moving that database to the
[11:25] government's servers might give them a
[11:28] much more direct way to print money in
[11:31] the sense and especially if you tie that
[11:33] to something like a Ubi payment right
[11:36] where they might say we're going to just
[11:37] we're going to create these new digital
[11:40] dollars out of nowhere and give them out
[11:42] just like straight straight helicopter
[11:43] money um you know I think it's very
[11:47] likely that whatever the system they end
[11:49] up moving to uh is going to come with a
[11:51] carrot more so than a stick yeah
[11:53] probably carots work better and it is
[11:55] it's really interesting because I mean
[11:57] we kind of sawed with that whole how was
[11:59] it called World coin thing and I saw it
[12:03] I was back then in Munich when where I
[12:06] Liv back then when this thing was a
[12:09] popular people really lined up to scan
[12:12] the IRS to get some shitcoin and I'm
[12:16] like why are you doing that because
[12:18] there was a small incentive there and
[12:21] how big will be the incentive when when
[12:23] like governments come into the game and
[12:25] and give a digital currency when it's
[12:27] not just like a small startup that wants
[12:30] to try that out and and scans your ears
[12:33] but what if like the government that
[12:35] most people still
[12:37] trust actually does that I mean in
[12:41] Austria it's like that maybe in Canada
[12:42] already is reversing where people don't
[12:44] trust the government I don't know how
[12:46] the current state is but that's that's
[12:49] that's really interesting for me how
[12:50] this this will all shake out in the end
[12:53] when when governments come in and
[12:55] counties come in like hey we have that
[12:57] digital currency you use it because we
[13:01] have that carrot that like I don't know
[13:03] 100 bucks or something like that when
[13:04] you sign up the first account or
[13:05] something like that I mean as Salvador
[13:07] did the same thing with Bitcoin they had
[13:10] a sign up bonus also there but it's not
[13:12] comparable really cool um by by the way
[13:15] on the topic of Canada I mentioned it
[13:18] before uh we were recording most
[13:21] Canadian bitcoiners I speak to on the
[13:23] podcasts are no longer in in Canada you
[13:27] you are like you're in in Canada but not
[13:29] you're in ALU you're not really in
[13:31] Canada do you see a future for for
[13:33] bitcoiners in in Canada in ALU I guess
[13:36] so but Canada also yeah so yes and no um
[13:41] a book that I I I hope you've read that
[13:44] I I think I'd recommend all bitcoiners
[13:47] read as the sovereign individual I'm
[13:49] actually uh I'm actually rereading this
[13:51] right now and one of the interesting
[13:53] things that it points out you know it's
[13:54] its General thesis is that the day of
[13:56] the large scale nation state is over and
[13:59] and it actually predicts that Canada
[14:00] will be one of the first to fall and the
[14:04] reason for that is because we're so
[14:05] large you know we have such a small
[14:06] population in such a large space and
[14:10] like to compare to like the European
[14:12] example um the distance between Calgary
[14:15] and Quebec um you know it it'd be like
[14:19] comparing Austria to like aeran or
[14:23] somewhere like that you know like it's a
[14:25] it's a vast difference in in space and
[14:27] the cultural differences over that area
[14:29] are quite significant as well and we do
[14:32] have some Canadian cultural influences
[14:34] that uh that keep us together you know
[14:36] when I talk about the potential breakup
[14:38] of Canada um one thing that everybody
[14:40] brings up is what about the hockey team
[14:43] um you know we we we're we are very
[14:45] patriotic about being the best country
[14:47] in the world for hockey but other than
[14:49] that like there's not a whole bunch of
[14:51] stuff that holds us together as a nation
[14:53] and so I think as the economic
[14:55] incentives get worse and worse um the
[14:58] the the likelihood that Canada stays
[15:01] together gets gets less and less likely
[15:03] and like I mentioned earlier I'm in I'm
[15:05] in Alberta and Alberta is in western
[15:08] Canada we're the we're sort of like the
[15:10] the Texas of of Canada we're often
[15:12] called and we're sort of like more
[15:14] freedom-- minded you know we have the
[15:15] oil and gas industry here um we have a
[15:18] lot more individualistic population but
[15:22] and as a result of of our oil and gas
[15:24] riches we we pretty much pay for the
[15:26] whole country to subsist and
[15:29] we don't get nearly enough back from the
[15:32] country as compared to what we put in
[15:33] and that's um very obvious in a bunch of
[15:36] areas and so the incentives are not
[15:39] there for Alberta to continue from an
[15:42] economic perspective to be a part of
[15:43] Canada and really what's holding Canada
[15:46] together now is is not rational
[15:48] self-interest on the part of the
[15:49] provinces or the people in the provinces
[15:51] it's just this kind of like archaic
[15:54] nationalism mixed with sort of slow
[15:57] moving political machines that would
[15:59] take a long time um but I think if you
[16:02] had a if you had a well-informed
[16:04] population looking at the incentives we
[16:06] would leave right now because we're
[16:08] we're getting looted we we put in way
[16:11] more money than we get back out and the
[16:14] long-term outcome is that the the
[16:16] government of Canada is not going to be
[16:17] able to continue to pay its exorbitant
[16:20] spending and I think we're we're kind of
[16:24] in an interesting spot as Canadians
[16:27] because we have the unique it it it can
[16:31] be a it can be a benefit and it can be a
[16:33] downside that we have maybe the most
[16:36] incompetent government in the world you
[16:38] know they're they're a bunch of bumbling
[16:41] buffoons and at this point they can't
[16:44] really do much of anything right at all
[16:47] and in some ways that's a benefit
[16:49] because as I mentioned earlier when they
[16:51] print money to spend money part of what
[16:53] they want to spend that money on is
[16:54] stepping on our necks right they want to
[16:56] keep us down they want to stifle our
[16:58] speech they wanna they want to keep us
[17:00] from seeing the truth of what they're
[17:02] doing to our country and they're just
[17:03] not really good at that or anything else
[17:06] and so the downside to that is that you
[17:09] know a lot of their their short-term and
[17:11] more recent policies have been just
[17:13] catastrophically bad and that's led to
[17:16] bitcoiners who have the means to leave
[17:18] to leave in large numbers you know we've
[17:20] seen people moving all over South and
[17:22] Central America um people who can work
[17:25] from anywhere are not incentivized to
[17:27] stay in a jurisdiction takes advantage
[17:29] of them it's as plain and simple as that
[17:31] and my hope is that Alberta um either as
[17:34] a separate entity at some point or even
[17:36] within Canada can can draw a lot of
[17:38] those people in because we are more of a
[17:40] freedom focused jurisdiction and we
[17:42] don't have um at least at the provincial
[17:45] level we don't have a government that's
[17:46] looking to subjugate us and put us down
[17:50] at every every step I think and so I'm
[17:53] not like I'm not going anywhere if I
[17:56] leave I'm taking the province with me
[17:58] but uh I've definitely
[18:00] seen a bunch of them have lefted a bunch
[18:02] of Canadian bit we we we have fewer
[18:05] really good quality Canadian bit Corners
[18:07] than we did four years ago so absolutely
[18:12] but it's still within Canada and has the
[18:16] same tax system or is it already kind of
[18:18] separate uh um is it comparable with the
[18:22] United States or is it like really like
[18:24] one thing like Austria yeah it's um it
[18:28] it's a it's a mix we have federal taxes
[18:31] and we have provincial taxes uh our
[18:33] provincial taxes are the lowest anywhere
[18:35] in Canada they're they're incredibly low
[18:37] and if you if you measure the all-in
[18:39] corporate tax rate we're actually lower
[18:41] here than anywhere in the United States
[18:43] so our taxes are quite favorable here um
[18:46] but they're you know the big tax that
[18:48] you can't really measure is the money
[18:50] Printing and when they print money we in
[18:53] Alberta as a province we don't get to
[18:54] print money the federal government gets
[18:55] to print money and we don't get to
[18:57] decide where that money is spent and so
[18:59] disproportionately the money that they
[19:01] they print is spent elsewhere in the
[19:04] country and when they do spend it here
[19:06] it's usually to to harm us that's the
[19:08] funny thing with with Bitcoin it's like
[19:10] if once you adopt a Bitcoin
[19:13] standard you kind of even in in favor of
[19:16] inflation because this this will just
[19:18] drive Bitcoin adoption long like that
[19:21] that's probably the the quickest way we
[19:23] get to bitcoin adoption if all
[19:25] governments start the real hard printer
[19:27] tomorrow and we like have hyperinflation
[19:30] like in in one year or two years I guess
[19:32] that's the fastest way to have a bit
[19:34] conization Yeah there there's a whole
[19:36] group of Canadian bitcoiners that count
[19:38] themselves as
[19:40] accelerationists and so their idea is
[19:42] like we should be voting for Justin
[19:43] Trudeau who's our our
[19:46] megalomaniac leader because the
[19:50] the more of his leadership this country
[19:52] has the faster it will melt down and the
[19:55] sooner that we can get out from under
[19:56] the boot of this centralized dictator I
[19:59] I heard the same argument for camela
[20:02] Harris yeah I hear the same one for for
[20:05] for the states also yeah and it it's
[20:07] funny because I was um I was looking at
[20:10] some of your old shows and I see you
[20:11] have a lot of price predictions on there
[20:13] and I was like I don't even know how to
[20:14] make a price prediction but I think the
[20:17] any any price prediction has to come
[20:19] with um a prediction for kamla and a
[20:21] prediction for Trump because I think it
[20:23] meaningfully impacts the difference and
[20:27] a a a Trump presidency I think is better
[20:31] for the price of Bitcoin in the short
[20:32] term you know we'll probably see some
[20:35] we'll probably get Ross alri out and get
[20:37] a bunch of Buzz and the likelihood of
[20:40] another 3x or so Bull Run happening and
[20:42] we get 150 Grand or um you know anywhere
[20:46] between like my my my like finger in the
[20:50] air which is almost never wrong um is
[20:53] that if if Trump is elected our bitcoin
[20:56] price will be somewhere between 20,000
[20:57] and 300,000 us within his term but the
[21:03] the Bitcoin
[21:04] price that you might be able to guess
[21:07] could happen with a Camala Harris uh
[21:10] regime doesn't really have uh doesn't
[21:12] really have a top because she might end
[21:16] the United States within her first
[21:17] four-year term like that that is
[21:20] entirely possible and in a scenario like
[21:22] that the price of Bitcoin goes to you
[21:25] know measured in today's dollars it goes
[21:28] to a trillion or or something to that
[21:30] effect I don't I don't know what the
[21:31] math is but taking out the world's US
[21:35] dollar the world's Reserve currency um
[21:38] is something that might happen under you
[21:40] know the seemingly insane leadership
[21:42] that uh she's trying to bring to the
[21:44] table and I think if like it doesn't
[21:48] seem it doesn't seem realistic to me
[21:50] that the uh Democrats could win without
[21:54] really severe cheating and I think
[21:56] that's something that um
[21:59] you know most people who are watching
[22:01] the situation with a clear eye would
[22:03] probably acknowledge is that there you
[22:04] know there's going to be cheating on
[22:05] both sides I think but the Democrats
[22:07] seem to be a lot better at it and if she
[22:10] gets in um I think all bets are off on
[22:12] the price of Bitcoin you know we we may
[22:14] we may move from where Bitcoin is now
[22:17] which is kind of like a risk on price
[22:20] you know people are gambling on it and
[22:21] so when when markets go down Bitcoin
[22:24] goes down um which is not what we should
[22:28] expect
[22:29] those of us who know what Bitcoin is
[22:31] really right we should expect it to be a
[22:33] safe haven asset for uh times of
[22:37] financial trouble and ultimately I think
[22:39] it will be that out of necessity right a
[22:43] CALA Harris presidency could switch that
[22:47] logic and get us to a point where people
[22:50] are actually getting into Bitcoin in the
[22:52] United States specifically to avoid
[22:54] starving to death which I think will be
[22:56] a major incentive uh in in the future at
[22:59] some point before we get to
[23:01] hyperbitcoinization you know the saying
[23:02] is always everyone gets into Bitcoin
[23:05] when they deserve and in a lot of cases
[23:07] that's what it's frankly going to be
[23:08] it's just the only way to to keep your
[23:11] family safe and to to be able to survive
[23:13] another day is to be able to have a way
[23:14] to save the value that you create with
[23:15] your time and a completely insane United
[23:20] States that is printing an unlimited
[23:22] amount of money you know that I think
[23:25] gets us closer to that that logic switch
[23:29] I think that's a it's a it's a great
[23:30] point and I think that's what also a lot
[23:32] of people point out with C Harris uh
[23:36] thing so so interesting it's it's I had
[23:39] the discussion last time I think with
[23:40] the guest that was actually released
[23:42] yesterday about bitcoin price prediction
[23:44] he's like yeah all bitcoin price
[23:46] predictions are true just
[23:48] like the the question is just like when
[23:52] eventually they they will go to zero so
[23:55] like if you call like yeah like Bitcoin
[23:57] will be too qu trillion dollars yeah you
[24:00] at some point you will have you were
[24:02] right and that's that that's an
[24:04] interesting thing about price prediction
[24:06] but I guess it's it's interesting to uh
[24:09] think about what the price in Bitcoin
[24:11] could be in today's tallest terms so
[24:14] like in in without no inflation if like
[24:17] assume that for moving on what what
[24:20] could I mean the better question then
[24:22] probably is like what can Bitcoin buy
[24:25] you in in like 10 50 years like what
[24:28] will be the the meaning of like one
[24:30] Bitcoin or 0.1 Bitcoin or like all those
[24:33] those specific numbers I think that's a
[24:35] I think that's a bigger question to ask
[24:38] of like okay how much of the total net
[24:40] assets will Bitcoin consume and and all
[24:42] those those things what do you see is
[24:45] like the most bullish end case if
[24:48] there's an end case for Bitcoin is
[24:50] another question but it's the most
[24:51] bullish outlook for for
[24:54] Bitcoin yeah I mean you can't really
[24:56] separate the two things you can't
[24:57] separate the debasement of the dollar
[24:59] from the increase in price in Bitcoin
[25:01] because they they will always be
[25:02] happening at once um I think those kind
[25:06] of you know going to trillions or
[25:08] quadrillions of dollars those assume
[25:10] that the dollar has entered a death
[25:12] spiral of hyperinflation which leads to
[25:16] hyperbitcoinization
[25:18] um I think in the absence of a dollar
[25:22] death spiral we're looking at still a
[25:24] scenario where that
[25:27] debasement can can can drive the price
[25:29] of Bitcoin very significantly and then
[25:31] the question is like there there's a
[25:33] scenario in the world where Kamala
[25:35] Harris gets elected and runs a c a
[25:39] catastrophically bad Administration very
[25:41] much like the current one who is sending
[25:43] Mass amounts of money overseas and
[25:45] funding war after war and pork Barr
[25:49] spending every which direction and
[25:52] allowing the border to remain open and
[25:53] all these things that we we see that are
[25:56] are causing I would call a rapid
[25:58] degenerate degeneration of society in
[26:01] the United States um so it is possible
[26:04] that she does all those things without
[26:05] going completely off the cliff and in a
[26:08] scenario like that we can probably see
[26:11] you know it it's going to be worse than
[26:13] it has been the last four years and so
[26:16] the question becomes does that shift of
[26:18] logic happen from Bitcoin being a a
[26:21] speculative risk on asset that people
[26:24] are are gambling in in the markets in
[26:27] order to to sell for more dollars later
[26:30] which is basically what it is now or
[26:32] does it make that shift to more more
[26:34] towards what we expect gold to be which
[26:36] is this this hedge to all of those
[26:39] things the Hedge to the money printing
[26:40] which logically it is but that's just
[26:42] not how the the markets are treating it
[26:44] right now and so I think that will
[26:46] really determine very significantly
[26:48] where the price goes um but my my finger
[26:52] in the air for a Kamala Harris four-year
[26:55] term um without like if we if we remove
[26:59] the hyperbitcoinization
[27:01] scenario um is is probably probably a
[27:05] wider range and so the the bottom end
[27:08] might be lower it might be 10 or 15,000
[27:11] and then the up upper end would be much
[27:12] higher so um I would say over the next
[27:15] four years you know if we're looking at
[27:18] uh maybe two more sort of bull
[27:21] cycles um it would be it would be
[27:24] reasonable that the top would be
[27:25] somewhere between 1 and 10 million per
[27:27] Bitcoin in today's dollars if you watch
[27:29] or listen to my podcast on a regular
[27:32] basis I'll guess you already bought some
[27:34] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[27:37] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[27:40] in a hardware wallet my personal
[27:42] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[27:44] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[27:47] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[27:49] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[27:52] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[27:55] with the code Robin at the checkout this
[27:58] bitbox do Swiss robobin to get your
[28:02] bitbox and the next step is to really
[28:04] level up your sovereignty as an
[28:06] individual you have to have the most
[28:09] secure self- custody setup you have to
[28:11] secure your own devices you have to
[28:14] protect your privacy you have to set up
[28:17] an inheritance plan and depending on
[28:20] where you live you even want to have a
[28:22] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[28:25] in case something goes really really
[28:27] wrong and through all all those steps
[28:28] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[28:31] step by step and if you visit the
[28:34] Bitcoin way.com
[28:35] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[28:39] minute free call to find out how you can
[28:41] level up your sovereignty and last but
[28:44] not least I have something completely
[28:46] new for you guys I partnered up with
[28:50] coin vigilante this is the most
[28:52] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[28:55] saw created by anyone look at that
[28:58] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:01] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[29:04] the perfect subtle elent way to go out
[29:07] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:10] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[29:13] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[29:16] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:20] watch collections you have the date of
[29:22] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:25] there and of course also the block High
[29:28] and which EPO we are currently in I love
[29:32] the level of detail they put in in this
[29:34] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[29:37] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[29:40] down in the descriptions I love those
[29:42] watches so so much that that seems at
[29:46] first aggressive but I think if you
[29:48] really think about it that that's really
[29:51] doable in in the in the upper end of it
[29:54] by the way you mentioned the death the
[29:55] dollar death spiral is that in the long
[29:58] run even avoidable is it just a matter
[30:00] of time till this spiral
[30:02] begins yeah it is just a matter of time
[30:05] um there there there are some ways that
[30:08] current company or sorry countries can
[30:10] combat this death spiral I think right
[30:13] now they're all kind of racing away from
[30:15] it and we've seen a lot of countries
[30:18] sort of start into that spiral and some
[30:20] you know Venezuela Zimbabwe are already
[30:22] gone um but we've got all these
[30:23] countries like Lebanon and Argentina
[30:25] that are right on the edge and I would
[30:28] expect that a lot more of the world's
[30:30] small currencies are going to be hitting
[30:31] that death spiral in the near future and
[30:34] at that point then we get into a
[30:36] competitive scenario about what kind of
[30:38] money that country is going to be using
[30:39] right and in some cases that will be
[30:41] very quickly delegated by a central
[30:43] government and in most of those cases
[30:46] the central government will pick um a
[30:48] regionally or politically
[30:50] expedient uh major currency so we may
[30:53] see more joining the Euro we may see a
[30:55] bunch of African countries moving to the
[30:57] Iran
[30:58] um Asian countries moving to Ian and
[31:01] we'll probably be in a scenario where
[31:03] there are six or seven currencies in the
[31:05] world uh five years from now and at some
[31:08] point all of them will enter that death
[31:10] spiral and so the prevailing logic would
[31:13] be I think that the United States dollar
[31:15] should probably end up being the last to
[31:18] die given its Reserve status and it's
[31:21] the the sort of unique ability that the
[31:22] United States has to to export their
[31:24] debt to other countries by having other
[31:27] count countes adopt their currency and
[31:28] then printing more of them um I think
[31:32] the dollar will probably be the last one
[31:34] but it is pretty much inevitable that
[31:36] they get there eventually and the only
[31:38] thing that they can do to slow it down
[31:40] is very unlikely because it really
[31:42] involves stopping the incredible rate of
[31:46] spending and in countries like the us
[31:49] where the debt is so large that the
[31:51] payments to cover the debt are in fact
[31:53] so large even just you know drastically
[31:56] reducing government spending isn't going
[31:58] to be enough to stop that death spiral
[32:00] because you still have to pay for the
[32:01] money that you've already printed and so
[32:05] I think it's very unlikely but if a
[32:06] country went back to a gold standard
[32:08] that would it would remove their ability
[32:11] to continue the fiscal excess that
[32:13] they've been engaging in but it would
[32:16] make it much more likely that their
[32:17] currency survives in the long
[32:19] term it's interesting yeah I I love I
[32:22] love that it's interesting how when you
[32:26] adopt Bitcoin and you understand all of
[32:28] the sudden this is a financial system
[32:30] then you're all of the sudden really
[32:31] relaxed because you know where it ends
[32:34] but at the same time it's quite
[32:35] frightening like oh yeah like when when
[32:38] my I don't know sister is now holding
[32:41] 100% of of her money in Euros because
[32:44] she in Austria and she trusts that she
[32:47] has to adopt the Bitcoin standard right
[32:49] now otherwise maybe her whole netw worth
[32:53] is is gone and then you as the single
[32:55] Bitcoin in the family you're like oh
[32:56]  I have to stack for for all those
[32:58] people because at some point they they
[33:00] will uh uh bang on my door and like hey
[33:03] Robin you're a Bitcoin all right yeah
[33:05] it's an interesting scenario with bitco
[33:08] yeah and I I think um that's where the
[33:11] sort of like Get Off zero campaign gets
[33:13] to be so important and you know getting
[33:16] your sister to put $10 a week into
[33:18] Bitcoin is not going to matter at all to
[33:21] her but if the scenario that we're
[33:23] talking about if the the Euro collapses
[33:27] and you guys are left with no functional
[33:30] currency in your in your region then the
[33:33] people holding Bitcoin are going to be
[33:34] in a drastically better position than
[33:35] those who had all their Assets in dollar
[33:37] or in Euros obviously and I think we're
[33:39] kind of starting to see that idea creep
[33:41] into the sort of popular lexicon around
[33:46] the world we've got a we've got a credit
[33:48] union like a small bank here in Alberta
[33:51] that um is trying to do this they want
[33:53] to be holding they want to be holding
[33:56] Bitcoin on the balance sheet of the bank
[33:58] The Regulators are not letting them do
[33:59] that yet but they're still trying to
[34:00] figure out how to do that but in the
[34:02] meantime they're holding gold on the
[34:04] balance sheet of the bank with the idea
[34:05] that you know it's not a lot of gold
[34:08] it's a it's a small percentage of the of
[34:10] their Capital requirements and reserves
[34:12] but the idea is that if the the entire
[34:14] Financial system collapses these
[34:16] depositors will get more than zero and
[34:18] that more than zero in a scenario like
[34:20] that will actually end up being quite a
[34:22] bit of spending power in all likelihood
[34:25] and so that's kind of the way that I
[34:26] would I would I would pitch it to the
[34:29] the friends and family that you realize
[34:32] you might need to pay for someday is
[34:34] that like you know it's it's a hedge and
[34:37] it's it's a hedge to everything that's
[34:39] going wrong in the world and I think
[34:41] we're in a scenario now where just about
[34:44] everyone can see that there is something
[34:47] going majorly wrong in the world right
[34:49] they don't necessarily know that all of
[34:51] the ills of society are pretty much
[34:53] caused by this debasement of currency
[34:55] and this money printing but they can at
[34:56] least feel the fact State Cost Triple
[34:58] what it did two years ago it's
[35:00] interesting when when we talk about
[35:02] because there was election right now in
[35:04] Austria and uh it it feels like there's
[35:06] those all those different political
[35:09] forces and they all blame it on someone
[35:12] else like there's a socialist like oh we
[35:14] have to tax the super
[35:15] rich then the right Wings say like oh
[35:18] it's about immigrants and then there's
[35:20] like there's all those
[35:22] different political groups and they all
[35:25] point to other people but they never
[35:27] point to the real reason why we have
[35:30] inflation why those things are actually
[35:31] going wrong and they're just like
[35:34] serving their own uh Target groups I
[35:36] guess and it's it's really interesting
[35:37] to see them like oh yeah he's talking
[35:39]  but he's talking a different
[35:41] but it's kind of the same that
[35:43] they're talking it's it's it's a nice
[35:46] it's it's a nice thing when you're
[35:48] Bitcoin and you're relaxed about it but
[35:50] it's it's kind of sading also at the at
[35:52] the same time let's come to a little bit
[35:55] of a positive thing to talk about
[35:58] once we have this hyperbitcoinization
[36:00] what do you think is the most impactful
[36:03] thing that Bitcoin changes in society
[36:06] with that will lead to a better world or
[36:09] like a a different
[36:11] world well it it it'll realign all the
[36:14] incentives essentially and that's when
[36:17] we were talking about the Bitcoin fixes
[36:18] everything idea that's kind of what it
[36:20] comes down to and you can take just
[36:22] about anything I was I was ranting about
[36:24] dishwashers earlier today in the same AA
[36:27] where you know a dishwasher is something
[36:30] that very clearly you want it to wash
[36:31] dishes right and that's that's your
[36:34] incentive that's my incentive to owning
[36:35] a dishwasher to get my dishes washed and
[36:39] at the same time the government has
[36:41] different incentives about dishwashers
[36:42] they because of this massive machine
[36:44] around the climate change
[36:46] environmentalist movement the
[36:48] government's incentive is that my
[36:49] dishwasher uses less power and less
[36:51] water and those things are actually
[36:54] counter to my incentives about getting
[36:55] my dishes cleaned and so when the
[36:58] government is essentially taking some of
[37:01] the money that I earn with my time the
[37:02] value that I earn with my time and
[37:05] stealing that from me by printing money
[37:08] the end result is that they get to spend
[37:10] it on things that are not in my best
[37:12] interests and
[37:14] dishwasher uh efficiency campaigns are
[37:17] one of those things that actually have
[37:19] nothing to do with me and
[37:21] so removing the ability of the
[37:23] government to prop up their own
[37:25] incentives
[37:27] realigns all of the incentives and I
[37:29] think we'll get back to an economy
[37:31] that's much more driven on sort of a
[37:34] selfish
[37:35] rationalism wherein you can expect the
[37:38] people that you're dealing with to act
[37:39] in their own best interests and they can
[37:41] expect that from from you as well and
[37:45] that in turn will lead to a much more
[37:48] streamlined and efficient version of the
[37:50] world economy because so much of the
[37:52] value that's created in the economy
[37:54] won't be getting spent on things that
[37:55] actually have nothing to do with that
[37:57] are not useful to really anyone right a
[38:00] huge percentage of government spending
[38:02] in the in the entire world really is
[38:04] going to corruption it's going to pay
[38:05] for the interests of the people who
[38:07] decide what the money gets spent on and
[38:10] that's kind of an unavoidable element of
[38:12] government is if you give people the
[38:14] ability to print money and spend it they
[38:16] will inevitably print it and they will
[38:17] inevitably spend it in their own best
[38:19] interests rather than the interests of
[38:21] the people that they they claim and
[38:23] purport to uh to represent it's
[38:26] interesting do you think that when we
[38:28] come to bitcoin standard and we have
[38:30] that world where governments are more
[38:34] service based you're like you pay
[38:38] government service because you actually
[38:39] drive on that road and it makes sense to
[38:42] to pay some Central
[38:44] Authority or some C like maybe
[38:46] everything gets privatized but that's a
[38:48] different discussion but if there's a
[38:51] government in the region and they own
[38:52] the streets you pay them for the streets
[38:55] in that scenario is there a um a need
[38:58] for social safety net of some sort do do
[39:02] you think there there's some sort of
[39:05] thing where we we need to I don't know
[39:08] care for for those who maybe come to to
[39:12] to the world with with disabilities or
[39:14] something like that I mean that's a very
[39:15] small group but it's still like maybe
[39:18] interesting to know how this will work
[39:19] on a on a Bitcoin world yeah I mean
[39:22] there there are obviously needs and when
[39:25] you say needs these are these are things
[39:27] that I believe the world would be better
[39:29] with are are things like a social safety
[39:32] net things like funding to take care of
[39:34] the disabled funding to help with drug
[39:37] addiction um to help those who are
[39:40] marginalized move away from the problems
[39:42] that are keeping their lives down and I
[39:46] think all of that is very Noble but the
[39:49] important part of that is that it has to
[39:51] be voluntary because if you know there
[39:55] there's the really Insidious term that
[39:57] gets used all the time is the word we
[40:01] and people say we should do this we
[40:03] should help the homeless we should
[40:06] increase health funding we should do
[40:07] this and what people usually mean when
[40:09] they say we is they mean someone else
[40:12] who I will delegate should take money
[40:14] from you and do this thing that I
[40:16] suggest and so as long as they can take
[40:20] money from me or value from me and I'm
[40:23] I'm including myself in in this in the
[40:25] useful members of society as as long as
[40:27] they can take value from those of us who
[40:30] produce those of us who run businesses
[40:32] those of us who do something useful and
[40:34] spend it in a way that is not aligned
[40:37] with the interests of the people they
[40:38] just took the money from that is in line
[40:41] with these vague concepts of the greater
[40:43] good driven by this wi
[40:46] scenario then this can never be a just
[40:49] act this is always going to be a theft
[40:52] and it doesn't matter how good the
[40:53] intentions of the people stealing the
[40:54] money are and it doesn't matter how good
[40:56] the outcome
[40:58] the fact they steal the money will be it
[41:00] will always still be theft and so that's
[41:03] the first problem the second problem is
[41:05] that because the incentives for
[41:07] everything are misaligned right so the
[41:08] government takes this money from me they
[41:11] take a cut they give it to a charity
[41:12] who's going to help the homeless the
[41:14] charity takes a cut and there isn't an
[41:16] incentive along the way for these people
[41:18] to spend the money properly there's no
[41:20] disincentive for them to to avoid
[41:22] wasting or stealing the money and that
[41:25] this is the problem that is ubiquitous
[41:26] Crossing every government in the world
[41:28] and so the question I guess comes down
[41:30] to if there was no government would
[41:33] there still be a social safety net would
[41:34] rich people donate their time and money
[41:37] to causes that they believe in and I
[41:39] think the answer is obviously yes and
[41:41] Not only would people still fund
[41:43] voluntarily these kind of programs that
[41:45] they they want to see existing in the
[41:48] world those of us who who are in the
[41:50] productive class will actually have a
[41:52] lot more money to fund those things
[41:54] because the compounding effects of not
[41:56] having our Capital stolen from us over
[41:58] time will just drastically increase the
[42:01] prosperity of everyone involved and so
[42:04] really the the entire economy will be
[42:06] much more useful a lot more Prosperity
[42:08] will be created and I would rely on the
[42:11] the the the good feelings of those who
[42:15] end up wealthy and under a Bitcoin
[42:16] standard to pay for a lot of Social
[42:18] Services and not only that they'll pay
[42:20] for these
[42:21] services in a way that avoids the kind
[42:24] of crushing bureaucracy that we see
[42:26] through the government right now now
[42:27] like I don't know what the I don't know
[42:28] what the total is but for every dollar
[42:30] that uh you know the the government
[42:34] prints and and therefore steals from the
[42:37] rest of us a massive percentage of that
[42:39] spending is going to their own Pockets
[42:41] to their own bureaucracy to their own
[42:43] Comforts and then and then to the the
[42:46] sort of crony capitalism of giving
[42:48] government contracts to their friends
[42:50] and all this stuff it's it's it's very
[42:52] rare that you see a government take some
[42:55] money and actually do something useful
[42:56] with it wholeheartedly agree with all
[42:59] you
[43:01] said I I I wanted to give a comment but
[43:04] I I think I just leave it at that that I
[43:07] completely agree with like I usually um
[43:10] vote for the the political party that
[43:12] tries to to makes the argument that we
[43:15] need less government and that's actually
[43:18] sometimes different parties it's
[43:20] interesting to
[43:21] see different kinds of votes but it's
[43:24] it's sometimes really hard to find that
[43:26] party because most parties are like we
[43:28] need more money for that so like they
[43:30] all want more money but for different
[43:32] caes and then they're like yeah they I
[43:34] cannot vote for anyone of this um one
[43:37] other topic that I want to make uh open
[43:40] today before we got come to the end
[43:42] routine is we kind of had it a little
[43:44] bit with the 6102 order um with Bitcoin
[43:49] ETFs it's it's interesting for me that
[43:52] now there's like this all those um
[43:55] traditional Finance money coming and
[43:57] traditional Finance products coming in I
[43:59] mean in Europe we have a Bitcoin ETP
[44:02] since like 2015 I think as so Bitcoin
[44:05] ETF and Canada also had it before us so
[44:09] the Bitcoin ETF is just news for America
[44:11] but America is so big that it's news all
[44:14] around the world but the thing is like
[44:17] Banks trying to move into Bitcoin we
[44:19] have it in a lot of different
[44:21] countries we have now like Bitcoin ETFs
[44:24] blackr coming into Bitcoin and they all
[44:27] want to
[44:29] basically convince us that we don't need
[44:31] to take self custody bring the Bitcoin
[44:34] to us we would take care of you we take
[44:36] care of your Bitcoin is that a potential
[44:40] danger to do do the Bitcoin hodlers and
[44:43] in bitcoiners with like maybe the as you
[44:46] said before they have to come to your
[44:48] house and hold the gun but maybe they
[44:51] can just go to Black Rock and say like
[44:52] oh those are now government property
[44:55] that's an easier way and they already
[44:56] hold some Bitcoin what do you think
[44:58] about that yeah I mean that's an obvious
[45:00] risk um I will put it out there also
[45:03] that I would be willing to hold on to
[45:04] everyone's Bitcoin for
[45:06] them like that like why would you why
[45:10] yeah why would you trust somebody who
[45:11] says that right that makes no sense but
[45:14] that is kind of an inevitable scenario I
[45:16] think you know we've got a mass amount
[45:18] of Bitcoin that all the ETFs Black Rock
[45:21] Etc all of micro strategies coins are
[45:24] all sitting in coinbase and the chances
[45:28] that um the coinbase will hand those
[45:31] coins over to the United States
[45:32] government in their entirety are 100%
[45:36] it's just a matter of timeline it's
[45:38] there's there's literally zero chance
[45:40] that they will not come for those coins
[45:42] someday and really I expect that that
[45:45] probably will be part of the death
[45:46] throws of the United States when they
[45:48] actually come to that point because
[45:50] ultimately what a an an inflationary
[45:53] spiral involves generally is you get to
[45:55] a point where the guys with guns will no
[45:58] longer take the dollars that you print
[45:59] in order to rob people and you need a
[46:02] different way to pay them and we saw
[46:03] that very quickly the Venezuelan
[46:05] government started paying their military
[46:07] in American dollars well the rest of the
[46:09] country was not allowed to be using
[46:11] American dollars and so that's what
[46:13] we're going to see in the United States
[46:14] is eventually the need for the state to
[46:17] seize all of the Bitcoins that they can
[46:19] get their hands on to continue to spend
[46:23] and the the logical thing to do the
[46:26] smart thing to do would be at the time
[46:29] that they seize those Bitcoins which is
[46:30] going to be several million Bitcoin to
[46:33] reeg their currency to a value backed by
[46:36] those Bitcoins right but they're not
[46:39] going to do that they're they're
[46:40] addicted to the they're addicted to the
[46:42] the spending they're addicted to the
[46:43] money printing machine and the fact is
[46:45] that the the vast vast majority of the
[46:48] services that the federal government of
[46:50] the United States offers need to stop
[46:53] being offered because they can't pay for
[46:54] them it's it's just math right and
[46:57] eventually that will come true they
[46:59] can't keep sending an unlimited amount
[47:00] of money to Ukraine and Israel and
[47:01] wherever else the next you know there'll
[47:03] be another war on the
[47:05] horizon six months from now there's
[47:07] always there's always another War as
[47:09] long as they have the ability to print
[47:11] money to pay for it and that addiction
[47:14] to that spending is not going to go away
[47:17] until it's forced to go away and it
[47:19] won't be forced to go away at that point
[47:21] that we're describing because what I
[47:23] expect them to do is to steal the coins
[47:25] that are in coinbase micr strategy all
[47:27] the ETFs Etc they'll issue some
[47:31] I that will either be denominated in
[47:33] dollars or they may even be denominated
[47:35] in in Bitcoin they may they may say you
[47:37] know the the United States government
[47:39] owes you three million Bitcoin whatever
[47:42] that OU is worth you know you can all
[47:46] make your own choices but the what will
[47:48] follow is that they'll take the millions
[47:50] of Bitcoin that they've stolen and then
[47:52] they'll spend
[47:53] them and when they spend them they will
[47:56] run out
[47:57] and eventually at some point they will
[47:59] be completely out of Bitcoin so they can
[48:00] seize they will no longer have the
[48:02] ability to print dollars to spend and at
[48:05] that point they will not have the
[48:06] ability to pay for the massive military
[48:08] apparatus that holds the whole thing up
[48:10] that's really interesting also I think
[48:12] the the example with and the comparison
[48:14] with Venezuela is really suiting because
[48:17] that that count is literally we seen
[48:21] what happens also interesting that there
[48:23] I think like onethird of the population
[48:25] left like that's that's like uh the game
[48:27] theory aspect of of like the countries
[48:30] that adopt the Bitcoin standard or can
[48:33] kind of get the Bitcoin is to come to
[48:35] them will probably win out in the long
[48:37] run because we see them actually moving
[48:39] I see a lot of even Germans there now
[48:41] moving to Salvador it's fascinating for
[48:44] me to to see so many one other topic
[48:46] that I almost forgot you you raised it
[48:49] before we started recording you you have
[48:51] a uh conference coming up and there's
[48:55] one interesting topic psychedelics and
[48:57] Bitcoin uh it's interesting because I
[48:59] had with ioni appleberg is it ioni
[49:04] something like that appleberg who wrote
[49:06] the book also abundance for scarcity and
[49:09] he with him I also went down down that
[49:12] rabbit hole what is it makes it special
[49:15] that psychedelics and Bitcoin Rabbit
[49:17] Hole yeah so yeah I'll I'll I'll tell
[49:20] you what the event is called Sovereign
[49:21] Minds um Sovereign m.ca is the website
[49:25] we've got really in in expensive tickets
[49:27] and uh we're hoping to get a lot of
[49:30] different communities in and so yeah the
[49:32] the event is focused on bitcoin gold
[49:35] psychedelics personal healing circular
[49:38] economies and Bitcoin again and so it's
[49:42] like I mentioned very Bitcoin focused
[49:44] we're trying to bring in these adjacent
[49:46] economies or sorry adjacent communities
[49:49] because I see a lot of these people as
[49:51] being the potential next future
[49:53] bitcoiners you know these are in a lot
[49:55] of cases people who've identified the
[49:57] problem of the overextension and ever
[49:59] expanding creep of the government's
[50:00] reach power and spending and the
[50:04] difference is that they haven't
[50:05] necessarily seen the solution that we
[50:07] have seen and so we're trying to get
[50:09] Bitcoin in front of more of these crowds
[50:12] um and your question about psychedelics
[50:14] I found you know we we wanted to include
[50:16] psychedelics in this event because I've
[50:18] actually found a lot of bitcoiners who
[50:20] have had really great experiences and
[50:22] and have really been involved in the
[50:24] Psychedelic communities and at first I
[50:26] was kind of like searching for why that
[50:29] was you know and I think I found the
[50:30] answer eventually after talking to
[50:31] enough of them is that both psychedelics
[50:34] and Bitcoin tend to sort of have mind
[50:36] opening properties you know what I mean
[50:38] you have experiences with both of these
[50:40] things and they start to shake your
[50:43] belief in the institutions of modern
[50:46] society and they start to make it more
[50:49] likely that you can accept new ideas
[50:52] that challenge those norms and so I've
[50:55] seen in both cases I've seen a lot of
[50:57] people come from psychedelics into
[50:59] Bitcoin and again partly because there
[51:02] are a lot of bitcoiners that are into
[51:03] psychedelics I've seen the opposite
[51:05] happen again and again where people get
[51:06] into Bitcoin this is my experience I
[51:08] never had really much of any experience
[51:09] with psychedelics until I was in the
[51:12] Bitcoin community and and talking to
[51:13] people that I was like you know what um
[51:16] like 20 years ago I might have looked at
[51:18] these things much more differently you
[51:20] know they were they were drugs they were
[51:21] scary they're not something that I would
[51:23] have wanted in my life but um seeing
[51:27] enough what I consider intelligent
[51:29] reasonable people talking to me about
[51:30] their positive experiences with these
[51:32] things led me to a point of being like
[51:35] maybe I should look into this stuff and
[51:37] I think that goes in both directions you
[51:38] see the bitcoiners in the Psychedelic
[51:41] Community um showing Bitcoin as a
[51:44] solution to all of these problems out
[51:47] there and this is the same for this is
[51:48] the same for gold this is the same for
[51:50] sort of like the freedom Community um we
[51:53] want to bring these people in because
[51:54] they they should be open to the
[51:57] discussion at least they should be open
[51:58] to see what we see that's very true I I
[52:01] love it when we can bring different
[52:04] communities uh together that's also what
[52:06] I try slowly slowly with the podcast
[52:09] getting people that have a small
[52:12] connection with Bitcoin but have mostly
[52:15] in another uh group of people connected
[52:19] so that's that's really interesting to
[52:21] to get those different communities
[52:22] together because we can learn from each
[52:24] other and we should not like bubble each
[52:27] other up and we going do a small small
[52:29] thing and we should actually search for
[52:31] those connection I love it a lot um now
[52:34] let's come closer to the end of the
[52:36] podcast I have always one question that
[52:37] I asked every guest of mine what can we
[52:40] learn from you besides Bitcoin that's a
[52:43] good question I mean my I I feel like I
[52:47] kind of rant professionally almost at
[52:48] this point and a lot of what I end up
[52:50] ranting about is the the state of the
[52:52] world and the state of our society and
[52:54] the the the evils of central planning
[52:57] and and collectivism and all of those
[53:00] things have to do with Bitcoin but they
[53:02] don't you know what I mean they're there
[53:04] are problems that Bitcoin
[53:07] solves um I think if you were to look
[53:10] back at at this interviewer or any of
[53:12] the other ones that I've done recently
[53:13] that's that's mostly what I end up
[53:15] ranting about is just the the way that
[53:17] the world has conspired to create this
[53:20] machine that essentially us and
[53:23] now we have a way to stop getting
[53:25] love it really cool perfect then uh we
[53:28] have endro in the podcast where the
[53:30] previous guest is asking a question for
[53:32] the next guest without knowing who the
[53:34] next guest is what is the most
[53:36] interesting fact about Satoshi Nakamoto
[53:39] oh the most interesting fact about
[53:40] Satoshi Nakamoto that's a good question
[53:43] um well I think the most interesting
[53:46] thing is that the money hasn't moved
[53:48] right because that's part of what makes
[53:50] Bitcoin so unique is that Satoshi left
[53:53] or died whenever he or she
[53:57] left or died because everyone who's
[53:59] founded another coin you know if you
[54:01] look down the list of the founders of
[54:02] the top 10 next coins they're all
[54:04] billionaires because they founded those
[54:06] coins and it's almost like an Immaculate
[54:10] Conception wherein the creation of
[54:12] Bitcoin and the both the process of
[54:15] reaching a network effect that happened
[54:18] at the same time as the process of the
[54:20] decentralization of control over the the
[54:23] code base and the implementation of that
[54:25] code base all sort of happened
[54:27] organically and there's not really a way
[54:30] to duplicate that and so Satoshi
[54:32] disappearing I guess and leaving the
[54:35] money on the table either indicates that
[54:38] it's the CIA or some other organization
[54:41] with the ability to take a very low time
[54:44] preference view of those those coins or
[54:47] that um if it was an individual which I
[54:50] suspect it's much more likely that this
[54:52] person has died or otherwise become
[54:55] unable to access the coins cuz it it
[54:58] would it it would be very unlikely for
[55:01] someone to leave billions of dollars on
[55:02] the table yeah it's interest for me I
[55:05] have another theory that I'm like if I
[55:08] would actually create Bitcoin I I would
[55:12] make it kind of known okay I have like
[55:14] this one million Bitcoin but then I
[55:16] would also not make it known that I have
[55:18] some some other small stack that
[55:21] involves some I don't know 10,000
[55:23] Bitcoins or something like that like in
[55:26] case it catches on I want to create this
[55:30] because he was like we don't know too
[55:33] much about him but I think he was very
[55:35] or she was very intentional about what
[55:38] he's trying to do so this first one
[55:42] million Bitcoin that it's not movable
[55:45] was not something by accident I think I
[55:48] mean we can only speculate nobody really
[55:50] knows but my best case is like it was
[55:53] not by accident he he really did like
[55:55] this one mil and then he just has like a
[55:58] a separate thing where he like oh let's
[56:00] let's get 10,000 Bitcoin is on separate
[56:02] wallet if it in case it catches on I
[56:06] have something or he just died me that's
[56:08] also a very realistic scenario because
[56:11] it's it's kind of a Wonder because still
[56:15] after like 15 years and so many people
[56:17] really desperately want to figure out
[56:19] who's aoto is and putting like a lot of
[56:22] money and a lot of resources behind that
[56:24] question it's it's kind of wonder that
[56:26] we still don't know this guy so probably
[56:28] he's gone my uh my the best theory that
[56:32] I've seen out there is the Lance asman
[56:34] Theory which if you Google Lens sassman
[56:38] um he kind of he fit the the mold for
[56:42] everything and he committed suicide
[56:45] right around the time that sohi
[56:46] disappeared so that would that would
[56:49] explain everything about
[56:52] Satoshi um but there's no like hard
[56:55] evidence of that yeah absolutely the the
[56:57] most fun theory is Steve Jobs because he
[57:01] also died around that that area I think
[57:04] that that would be the most fun one if
[57:07] if Steve Jobs uh cre a Bitcoin he
[57:10] definitely had the means to it and
[57:12] probably also not knowledge yeah really
