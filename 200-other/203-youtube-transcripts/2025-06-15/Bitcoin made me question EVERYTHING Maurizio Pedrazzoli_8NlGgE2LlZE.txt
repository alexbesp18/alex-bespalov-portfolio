[00:00] Bitcoin is a complete different Beast
[00:01] it's not even crypto in my mind Bitcoin
[00:03] is Bitcoin you won't be able to compete
[00:05] with something which has no CEO no
[00:08] marketing team bcoin is a no-brainer you
[00:09] don't even have to think about anything
[00:11] you just buy it and you are okay I love
[00:13] free market you do your stuff you put it
[00:15] out there and if people like it they'll
[00:16] buy it all of the sudden they're like my
[00:18] whole life I did not see what money
[00:21] actually is and then they go like what
[00:23] else is wrong what else can I question
[00:25] it's always your responsibility it's
[00:26] easy to say oh I'm broke because taxes
[00:28] move come to the Buy no tax next I'm
[00:31] broke because my job pays to find
[00:32] another job next you have to be in
[00:34] charge Bill Gates hates it okay well
[00:36] great just because Bill Gates hates it
[00:38] then does it make it bad it's like
[00:40] watching your entire life from one angle
[00:42] but if you move your chair and you look
[00:44] at the room from the other side it's
[00:45] like holy there is a TV there there is a
[00:47] window there I didn't know that I think
[00:49] Bitcoin offers you that it's it's all
[00:50] about Freedom it's all about core living
[00:53] kind of DNA mentality it's like most
[00:55] likely you're going to be an
[00:56] entrepreneur if you are a bitcoiner most
[00:58] likely you're someone who probably who
[01:00] experience life in a different
[01:02] [Music]
[01:04] way what do you think will be the role
[01:08] of Bitcoin in the world in two in 20
[01:11] years wow beautiful question I mean I
[01:13] would say now as we are in
[01:16] 2024 I think Bitcoin is established
[01:19] itself as a store of value right and I
[01:21] think this is a narrative I don't think
[01:23] it's a currency yet but I think it will
[01:25] provide some form of base layer for
[01:28] companies entrepreneurs to to build on
[01:30] top of it so I think in 20 years we will
[01:33] have things built on bitcoin H imagine
[01:37] as if you were rewind to the 70s when
[01:40] the dollar was back by the gold right so
[01:42] you could only print certain amount of
[01:43] dollars if you had reserves of gold so I
[01:46] think we will kind of be in that kind of
[01:48] situation where Bitcoin is going to be
[01:50] the layer zero if you want to call it
[01:52] like this and on top of it you will have
[01:55] multiple kind of things multiple
[01:57] Services multiple companies they will
[01:59] provide different things it could be
[02:00] inscriptions it could be art it could be
[02:03] currencies you know that kind of stuff
[02:06] and it's funny because you know when we
[02:07] think about I mean s okay 20 years from
[02:10] now I'll be 70 so I'll be really old but
[02:15] it's not even though it feels like a lot
[02:17] a I don't think it's a lot and B the
[02:20] amount of progress we will do in 20
[02:22] years is going to be exponential like
[02:24] look at the iPhone the iPhone came out
[02:26] in 2007 and look how much we progress
[02:29] from there so I think 20 years is a good
[02:31] number because it seems far but I don't
[02:34] think it's that far and the amount of
[02:36] progress we will see built on bitcoin
[02:38] will be exponential if it makes sense
[02:40] and you uh also talk way more than I do
[02:44] about altcoins uh you also uh interview
[02:47] people about that and I always thought
[02:50] or I still think that all the Alin use
[02:53] cases could actually be Better Built
[02:55] either on bitcoin or on a centralized
[02:59] database like either you you want it
[03:00] really secure and you want to build it
[03:01] on bitcoin or it's centralized on a
[03:03] database um do you also think like the
[03:06] the the use cases or like the altcoin
[03:08] sphere could actually move on when you
[03:10] talk about inscriptions nfts and all
[03:12] those orinal things do you think that
[03:15] could actually move on on bitcoin and
[03:17] and could kind of replace uh uh the
[03:19] altcoins I think so that's a beautiful
[03:21] observation I think in fact we've seen
[03:23] it like technically Litecoin was
[03:25] supposed to be a test net for for
[03:27] Bitcoin right so and now kind of
[03:29] Litecoin is faded into nothing um as
[03:31] opposed to for example ethereum back in
[03:33] the days we used to call Litecoin the
[03:35] silver of Bitcoin but now the silver is
[03:37] kind of ethereum so they kind of all
[03:38] over the place but if you look at what
[03:40] happened with ethereum for example they
[03:42] have this nft thing and then few years
[03:46] later boom Bitcoin said well that's
[03:49] actually interesting I'll take it so it
[03:51] does serve as a test net and I also
[03:52] agree with you like an oracle system
[03:54] would be much more useful for the
[03:56] majority of the tokens out there because
[03:58] at the end of the day people are saying
[04:00] we are decentralized I don't think they
[04:02] realize entirely what decentralization
[04:04] means they think about salanas or
[04:06] ethereum like proof of work and proof of
[04:08] stake are very different things as much
[04:10] as I'm up for because I I I strongly
[04:12] believe like we discuss it on on on my
[04:15] podcast on the other channel and you
[04:18] know I use I have I am a Bitcoin guy I
[04:20] have a small percentage of my portfolio
[04:22] I play with and the old objective of
[04:25] that is to multiply my Bitcoin so when I
[04:27] purchase an altcoin and the altcoin
[04:29] doubles I sell half into Bitcoin so it's
[04:31] a different way for me to play the game
[04:33] and maximize my Bitcoins at the end of
[04:35] the day and I've been successful at that
[04:38] if I wouldn't have done it I would have
[04:39] less Bitcoin so it comes with risk and
[04:42] you have to also it's an exchange you
[04:44] have to give energy so you have to put
[04:46] time into it and research and like you
[04:48] said so beautifully on on the podcast
[04:50] last time Bitcoin is a no-brainer you
[04:52] don't even have to think about anything
[04:54] you just buy it and you are okay whether
[04:55] when you purchase an altcoin you have to
[04:58] be mindful that that thing would very
[05:00] much go to nothing so it requires a
[05:03] different energy there but I also agree
[05:05] most of ethereum itself could be an
[05:07] oracle Solana could be an oracle
[05:09] actually if Solana would be an oracle
[05:10] would be more stable that's for sure and
[05:13] you know and not as much as people say
[05:15] is decentralized I beg to differ you
[05:19] know majority of the token are still I
[05:20] think 60% of tokens are in one two
[05:23] wallets so very much centralized but I
[05:26] think though they have a a purpose I
[05:28] don't think Bitcoin is going to conquer
[05:30] the 100% of the space I think there's
[05:32] going to be a small chunk maybe for
[05:36] other coins to solve other problems I
[05:38] don't think for example I a big fan of
[05:40] chain link it's a beautiful token I
[05:42] think it's a beautiful ecosystem but
[05:44] that could be an oracle yeah it doesn't
[05:46] have to be on ethereum or they are
[05:48] everywhere but they could be a
[05:50] centralized database so there is that
[05:53] kind of thing you know and the question
[05:55] you want to answer yourself is why do
[05:58] you have a data database and why you
[06:01] have a token like most of the most of
[06:03] the blockchain they don't need a token
[06:05] the token has no utility quote if you
[06:07] see what I mean it's interesting for me
[06:09] because I think the most like like
[06:12] blockchain is a really inefficient way
[06:14] to store data like when you look from a
[06:16] software development standpoint uh and
[06:19] that's why I always say like oh maybe
[06:21] the use case should be
[06:23] like because do do we really need like
[06:25] decentralization in video games like all
[06:28] all those things
[06:30] it's interesting for me to think about
[06:31] and I usually only have like uh
[06:34] bitcoiners on the podcast who like not
[06:37] don't even gamble with that and I love
[06:39] it that you classified as as as playing
[06:43] as gambling as as like oh I want to have
[06:45] a small portion of my portfolio and and
[06:48] I can play with that and I can try to do
[06:50] it and and it's it's when it's in that
[06:53] way it's completely leged for me when I
[06:55] have a problem with that is like when
[06:57] like oh no no like that's the future
[06:59] like this will replace Bitcoin or
[07:00] something like that then then it's like
[07:02] no no it's
[07:04] not yeah I've I've heard that multiple
[07:06] times uh people calling Bitcoin I I was
[07:09] talking to vitalic father on my podcast
[07:13] we had a podcast together and he was
[07:14] saying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin is old
[07:16] and needs to be replaced if you see what
[07:19] Charles hoskinson the founder of cardano
[07:21] says about Bitcoin you know everyone has
[07:23] an opinion I think it's great I I you
[07:25] know what I love free market I love free
[07:28] market you do your stuff you put it out
[07:30] there and if people like it they'll buy
[07:31] it amazing right the the trouble with
[07:34] these companies wanting to compete with
[07:36] the King AKA Bitcoin is they they start
[07:39] from the wrong angle I mean I shouldn't
[07:41] say wrong because always it's all
[07:43] subjective and objective but my idea is
[07:46] this one like if you have a company you
[07:48] started and you are the founder well you
[07:51] can't compete to begin with because
[07:53] Bitcoin doesn't have that so you already
[07:56] lost right so can you do something
[07:59] different can you provide a different
[08:01] service absolutely but you won't be able
[08:03] to compete with something which has no
[08:06] CEO no marketing team Bitcoin is a
[08:09] complete different Beast it's not even
[08:11] crypto in my mind Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[08:13] right there there's a difference there
[08:15] but then if you are someone who Deens
[08:18] into cat and dog tokens right and
[08:21] they've seen something on the newspaper
[08:24] they the guy who purchased whatever coin
[08:27] dog and they became a multi-millionaire
[08:30] there is an appetite for them to say oh
[08:31] it's me it's like the lottery mentality
[08:33] right and the lottery mentality sadly
[08:36] has two issues one most of the people
[08:38] are losing money right and two whoever
[08:41] wins the lottery in 12 months is broke
[08:44] so it's not a great statistically
[08:46] speaking like if you look into the data
[08:47] all the winners they won the lottery
[08:49] they've lost the money in eight to 12
[08:51] months so I don't think it's a great
[08:54] thing to have in mind as I'm going to
[08:55] win the lottery um also I don't like the
[08:58] fact that it's quote out of your control
[09:00] right I think luck is when preparation
[09:02] meets opportunity so you are the creator
[09:04] of your destiny I don't like to buy a
[09:05] ticket and gamble it in that sense at
[09:08] least if I do so has to be a small and
[09:11] controlled very controlled portion of my
[09:13] portfolio because you can Deen into
[09:14] stuff super fast hence why when I told
[09:17] you I have a I'm a big coiner but then
[09:20] on the weekends I go to the
[09:22] casino kind of you know and as long as
[09:25] you control yourself and you I even have
[09:27] an allocation like I have every four
[09:29] year cycle I give myself a portion of
[09:32] money to have fun with and if the money
[09:35] finishes in two months then I'm done for
[09:37] four years like because if you don't
[09:38] control yourself like this you can go
[09:41] down into a path where you click a
[09:43] couple of things and you start losing
[09:47] Bitcoin right or losing money depending
[09:49] for me it's the same thing but as long
[09:50] as it's controlled it's like imagine you
[09:53] I don't know you have a salary you have
[09:54] a job you have an income and then every
[09:57] now and then you take the wife the
[09:59] girlfriend and the boyfriend and you
[10:00] just go out and you have dinner you
[10:02] treat yourself you buy some clothing
[10:04] that's my my D gen right but it's very
[10:07] much meticulously controlled because
[10:10] it's so easy you know it's so easy to
[10:11] get into the Trap where you exchange
[10:14] some Bitcoin to some salana which no
[10:16] Financial advice you should not do but
[10:19] if you find yourself in a scenario where
[10:22] you wish to sell bcoin to buy salana
[10:24] then you start clicking around and
[10:26] buying Doge and Meme and not not Doge
[10:28] sorry dog coins on salana nfts and L you
[10:32] know you've lost everything it's so easy
[10:35] because it doesn't feel money I mean
[10:37] it's not money salana but whatever you
[10:38] see what I mean like it's really easy to
[10:41] the same with the credit card dilemma
[10:43] like back in the days when I was a kid
[10:44] we used to have cash in our pockets you
[10:46] know if you go out and you have 50
[10:49] whatever bucks or 50 EUR in your pocket
[10:52] when you don't have any more in your
[10:53] pockets that's it you're done so you can
[10:55] control your spending in a much more
[10:58] sophisticated way but now you tap your
[11:00] card you don't even know that's why
[11:02] everyone is broke I think because they
[11:04] don't they don't even know their economy
[11:06] like I thought Finance was That's Why by
[11:08] the way I came into Bitcoin via a
[11:10] necessity which was I need to be better
[11:13] with money so okay the first question is
[11:15] what is money that's that's my entry
[11:18] into the old shenan ends of crypto and
[11:20] Bitcoin because I think it's a problem
[11:22] Society like people they don't even know
[11:24] how much money they spend and how much
[11:26] money they make so when you draw a table
[11:28] saying this is how much comes in and
[11:30] this is how much goes out you just blow
[11:32] their mind like oh wow this is how much
[11:34] I'm spending oh wow maybe I shouldn't
[11:36] rent that place maybe I shouldn't buy
[11:38] that car maybe I shouldn't buy the food
[11:41] over there maybe I should cook myself
[11:43] lunch crazy right so what I see Al coins
[11:47] are amplifying the problem in a really
[11:49] weird angle I'm going here but I think
[11:52] they're going to allow you to demolish
[11:54] your precious store of value into a
[11:56] couple of clicks with the idea that you
[11:59] can make millions overnight so the old
[12:01] thing is rigged from the start does it
[12:05] make sense what I'm saying by the way
[12:07] yeah it makes a lot of sense I love it a
[12:08] lot and I didn't even want to interrupt
[12:11] you but it's like for me when when you
[12:14] have uh all those those alt coins and
[12:16] you recognize as we said before like you
[12:18] it's it's gambling uh then it's totally
[12:21] fine and it's like um it makes so much
[12:24] sense that Bitcoin is the way it is but
[12:28] what do you think think uh maybe
[12:30] stepping back one step what do you think
[12:33] makes Bitcoin so unique like why is
[12:35] Bitcoin this secure thing and not
[12:37] Myspace that will be replaced with
[12:40] Facebook yeah that's a beautiful
[12:41] question I mean first of all there is a
[12:43] a super common mistake people saying a
[12:45] 21 million it's not 21 million because
[12:47] it's less because a some some have
[12:50] gotten lost forever uh B some people
[12:52] will never sell see we have a satosi
[12:55] location so when you break down the
[12:57] supply which is one the most attractive
[12:59] thing besides portability div visibility
[13:02] and all those beautiful properties for
[13:04] me the fact that is there is a cap is
[13:06] amazing like at least I know how many
[13:08] there are whether when it comes to gold
[13:10] for example I don't know maybe we can
[13:11] find a mine next month and the price
[13:14] goes down maybe there is gold in the sea
[13:16] maybe there's gold in space I mean it's
[13:18] impossible to put a cap on a metal
[13:20] because we don't produce it whether
[13:22] Bitcoin is programmed to a certain
[13:24] degree to be capped to 21 million let's
[13:28] say for the sake of it even even though
[13:29] it's less that's the first interesting
[13:31] part second interesting part is the fact
[13:33] that it's digital so that means it can
[13:36] be truly yours like anything physical
[13:38] can be excuse me can be stolen can be
[13:40] taken right so if I oh it's funny when
[13:44] you break down the ownership kind of
[13:47] paradig you realize quickly you don't
[13:49] own anything uh everything you think you
[13:51] own someone else has it for example I
[13:54] speak a lot with people in real estate
[13:57] and when I tell them the house is not
[13:59] yours they they go crazy oh what do you
[14:02] mean it's not mine it's mine and I'm
[14:04] like no I'll tell you two reasons why
[14:06] one if you pay a tax to own it well that
[14:08] means someone can take it away if you
[14:11] don't pay the tax right and second of
[14:13] all try not to pay a speed ticket so you
[14:17] for those of whom think you own your
[14:20] house you just go to speed somewhere
[14:23] really fast and you get a fine well try
[14:26] not to pay it see what happens they're
[14:28] going to come they're going to take the
[14:29] house to pay the ticket so whether
[14:32] Bitcoin if stored properly because if
[14:34] you leave your Bitcoin on exchanges it's
[14:36] the same thing if you buy an ETF it's
[14:38] the same thing but if you do self
[14:40] custody in your own hands they can try
[14:43] and make you say the phrase or the seed
[14:44] phrase or 12 words 18 words depending on
[14:47] your story but you can always say I'm
[14:48] not telling you I don't care whatever
[14:50] you do to me which you have to be strong
[14:53] because they can do some terrible things
[14:55] to you but you have the option to decide
[14:57] where there is nothing else that gives
[14:59] you that power that control because
[15:01] everything else is an illusion I used to
[15:03] have gold I used to be a gold bug you
[15:05] can say in London but um I I came
[15:09] quickly to real to realize that it
[15:11] wasn't mine like there was a dude with a
[15:13] gun into a Cavo and he said whoa there
[15:15] is your name on a piece of gold in the
[15:17] corner right there you can't see it you
[15:19] can't touch it but it's yours and I'm
[15:21] like well not really you have the gun
[15:23] you have the C you have the key I only
[15:25] see a post it you could do the same
[15:27] thing to the next guy who com in you
[15:29] move my POS it you put Robin on top of
[15:32] it and then it's yours like I I I can't
[15:34] okay I can keep it in my own house but
[15:36] then anybody can come in and take it so
[15:38] it's not safe especially if you live in
[15:41] London I mean not to shade anything I
[15:43] live 17 years in the UK but it's not the
[15:45] safest place by any means so then you
[15:48] have a problem there because you have
[15:49] some valuable in your house you put them
[15:52] into a safe or whatever it might be but
[15:54] someone can come in and crack it whether
[15:55] Bitcoin is the most safe and secure
[15:58] network so I have security safety
[16:01] divisibility transportability and there
[16:04] is a cap so now all of a sudden it
[16:06] becomes and I can truly Own It by the
[16:08] way if stored properly now it becomes
[16:12] super attractive at least to me right
[16:15] and it's it's it's really interesting
[16:17] and you said before something that's uh
[16:19] that's really interesting that I want to
[16:20] touch on before I forget it you said um
[16:23] money oh Bitcoin oh no it's the same
[16:25] thing anyways um and like when we have
[16:28] money and we look at the properties of
[16:30] money like there's unit of account in
[16:31] there there's medum of Exchange in there
[16:32] like every all the aspects of of of the
[16:36] money in there that probably all my
[16:37] viewers already know um and there's a
[16:40] lot of debates going on in the Bitcoin
[16:43] Community um how long the Fiat system
[16:45] will uh last if the Fiat system will
[16:48] last there are those of the opinions
[16:51] like it will last three years there are
[16:53] those that say like it will never vanish
[16:56] uh will always be there first of all
[16:59] like do you think that feat will always
[17:01] be a thing even if we assume out like
[17:03] 2,000 5,000 years from now I I'm I'm
[17:06] aware that most think that 100 years
[17:09] definitely will be a thing because
[17:10] governments and the network effects are
[17:12] hard to break but do you think it will
[17:13] be ever
[17:14] replaced I I I think Fiat is going to be
[17:17] there forever like um I had a I had a
[17:19] beautiful debate I was hosting Peter
[17:22] schi versus the Vinci on my podcast gold
[17:24] versus Bitcoin they've gone on and on
[17:26] about Fiat and properties and here's the
[17:29] thing and that's my opinion I could be
[17:30] wrong here but um I I believe that most
[17:33] people they love Banks because banks are
[17:37] providing a service they don't care
[17:38] about ownership they don't care about
[17:39] the valuing they don't care about
[17:42] inflation cply as I call it it's it's
[17:45] convenient to have your
[17:47] money I just I need to be sorry with
[17:49] myself because I'm about to say two
[17:51] things that are terrible your money in
[17:53] the bank so first of all they're no
[17:54] money second of all they're not yours
[17:55] but whatever Let's Pretend let's all
[17:58] pretend that you have your money in the
[18:00] bank okay it's convenient and if you if
[18:03] you speak to someone who has done zero
[18:05] research if you are someone who's who's
[18:07] been I mean born everywhere I guess in
[18:09] Europe or anywhere in us or anywhere the
[18:12] bank is okay of course the bank is solid
[18:14] yeah the bank has my money what's wrong
[18:16] with you like look I can show you my app
[18:17] it says the balance like and people like
[18:20] it people don't want self custody do not
[18:22] want
[18:23] responsibilities majority of them I
[18:25] believe hence why Bank were invented
[18:27] it's a service right and and the service
[18:30] has a price the Vinci gave me a
[18:32] beautiful example the other day and he
[18:34] said when you go to a restaurant and you
[18:37] want to eat you take off your jacket and
[18:39] you give your jacket to to to the guy
[18:41] who manages the jackets he keeps the
[18:44] jackets the value the goods and he gives
[18:46] you a token with a number 29 okay now
[18:50] it's super important for you to realize
[18:52] you don't have a jacket anymore it's
[18:54] gone like the jacket belongs to the guy
[18:56] who has it he can sell it rent it break
[18:59] it burn it you can wear it he or she can
[19:03] do whatever he wants you on the other
[19:05] hand have a piece of plastic it's a
[19:07] promise that if you want the jacket back
[19:09] if the guy is still there because it
[19:12] might be gone he owe you the jacket now
[19:14] what happens when the guy is gone and he
[19:16] sold the jacket like FTX for example
[19:18] what happens when they are playing
[19:19] tricks or the banks the banks does not
[19:22] have your money the bank takes your
[19:24] money and they do stuff with it they do
[19:25] dodgy stuff because that's how Banks
[19:27] works well the you go to court and then
[19:30] the bank is entitled to only give you
[19:32] the value of the Fiat at the moment of
[19:34] the exchange so that means long story
[19:37] short if you purchase an asset AKA
[19:39] Bitcoin who goes up in value in my
[19:41] opinion so far far I've been doing and
[19:44] then you exchange it for whatever some
[19:46] reasons you deposit it on coinbase on
[19:48] Kraken on any exchange means you lose
[19:50] custody and then they sell it because
[19:52] they want to do Dodge your business and
[19:54] you sue them they're only entitled to
[19:56] pay you the value of the asset at the
[19:58] point of you know problems let's say
[20:03] which means they're keeping the good
[20:04] stuff and they give you the bad stuff so
[20:06] even though everyone knows yet banks
[20:10] are charging us a lot of money for
[20:13] transactions it takes forever to move
[20:15] money you are forbidden to to take cash
[20:18] I got married in Greece and I was living
[20:20] in the UK and I went to the bank and I
[20:22] said hey I would like to have some money
[20:24] some Fiat sorry to get married in Greece
[20:27] Shenanigans you can't it's too much I
[20:29] wanted like €20,000 I think I was asking
[20:32] somewhere in that region oh you can't
[20:34] withdraw more than 900 uh Euros because
[20:38] you can't carry it so you can't carry it
[20:40] through the airports they don't give it
[20:41] to you there are limits you you you're
[20:44] getting hammered on the exchange rate
[20:46] you can operate on a weekends and yet
[20:50] everybody loves Bank like they are
[20:52] convenient you have your card in your
[20:53] pocket you go to the cafe you tap the
[20:56] card so I don't think the average person
[20:58] person is even aware of all of those
[21:01] problems now there is a portion of
[21:03] people like you and me we are very much
[21:04] well aware of these hence why we
[21:06] bitcoiners but I think we represent a
[21:08] minority and I don't think Bitcoin is
[21:11] going to get so broadly distributed
[21:14] because people here's what I'm what I'm
[21:17] getting to my conclusion is like it's
[21:21] much easier to point a finger and blame
[21:23] someone else is supposed to take
[21:25] responsibility do you know how many
[21:26] people have told me like um no coiner as
[21:29] I called them or they have no exposure
[21:30] in Bitcoin and they said you're crazy
[21:32] you have your entire netw worth in your
[21:34] own hands you are nuts and I'm like well
[21:37] you are crazy because you have none of
[21:40] it but the reality I think is the
[21:43] majority of the people I'll probably say
[21:45] 8020 which is the it's a law that always
[21:47] balance itself out I think 80% of the
[21:50] people don't want that if you offer them
[21:52] self custody they will freak out
[21:55] remember the words access to a computer
[21:57] no no no no I want to have a custodian
[21:59] who keeps everything but if I have a
[22:02] problem I can go to the judge and they
[22:04] owe me my money I don't know if you
[22:06] agree here but I think the majority they
[22:08] don't care they don't
[22:12] care I would like to disagree but I
[22:15] think I
[22:17] agree like like my heart says no
[22:21] everyone will have custody Bitcoin they
[22:23] will learn about it and but then I go
[22:25] out in my friends and family circles and
[22:28] then I'm asking about what they're doing
[22:30] with the money what money is what they
[22:32] think of inflation all that stuff and
[22:36] I'm it's like it's hard to say for me
[22:38] but I'm just
[22:39] disappointed uh but so like there's like
[22:42] a part in me that wants to see the world
[22:44] on a Bitcoin standard uh but it's hard
[22:48] for me to imagine but I'm still hopeful
[22:51] like I'm I'm I'm a hopeful person in
[22:53] general and I want to see uh people on a
[22:56] Bitcoin standard and I just see maybe we
[23:00] can build banks on top of Bitcoin uh
[23:02] which are I don't know uh fedt I I like
[23:05] that project a lot um where we have like
[23:08] lightning as the super highways and then
[23:10] we have fedin where then there could be
[23:12] a service provider you don't even hold
[23:14] your keys
[23:16] but but at least it's Bitcoin that
[23:19] backing everything and you have the
[23:21] option to to actually go back down to
[23:24] the base layer or at least self custody
[23:26] lightning or whatever so that I'm I'm
[23:29] hopeful for that but let's say we don't
[23:32] come to that how do you think um Bitcoin
[23:36] will be Mass adopted and and how is it
[23:40] then only the store of value and it will
[23:42] go up in value because um big Banks and
[23:46] and institutional investors and and
[23:48] smart people buy it like gold we also
[23:51] don't use as a store Med of exchange or
[23:53] unit of account and it has uh like the
[23:56] 10x value or something like that then
[23:58] then than Bitcoin I don't know exactly
[23:59] what it is right now yeah that that's a
[24:02] good point I I think I think so like
[24:04] look with the ETF look at the amount of
[24:06] money flying into the ETF at the minute
[24:08] is because if if we are saying I think
[24:10] you said it on on the podcast we
[24:12] recorded on my channel if Bitcoin is the
[24:14] perfect money is supposed to be used by
[24:16] everybody so who am I to say you can't
[24:19] access it or you can't use it so I think
[24:21] that was a really good point you made I
[24:22] completely agree I think the gene is out
[24:24] of the box right so people are going to
[24:27] decide how
[24:29] I I love the fact that you have the
[24:31] freedom to say you know what um I want
[24:34] to decide how to purchase my Bitcoin I
[24:37] want to buy an ETF okay great I want
[24:40] Macio to have my own hands into the
[24:42] thing and cast myself great whether with
[24:45] money and Banks uh Fiat sorry you can't
[24:48] do that I mean so having the option to
[24:51] choose it's already a win and by the way
[24:54] if if I can manage to convince one
[24:57] person in 20 20 years of podcasting I I
[25:00] would won you know I I'm I'm not here to
[25:03] try to convince or brainwash anybody I'm
[25:05] just telling story talking to people and
[25:07] explain why I think it's important to
[25:09] get you know to get over and and get and
[25:12] get in charge because so many times
[25:15] people there is a quote I love that it
[25:16] says when you point one finger to
[25:18] someone or something three fingers are
[25:21] pointing back at you so it is always
[25:24] your fault always and it's always your
[25:26] responsibility so it's it's easy to say
[25:29] oh I'm broke because taxes I'm broke
[25:32] move come to Dubai no tax next oh I'm
[25:35] broke because my job pays to find
[25:36] another job next you have to be in
[25:39] charge but the reality is most of the
[25:43] people in our society they are this is
[25:46] my conspiracy hat on but the way how
[25:49] we've been educated the way the way how
[25:50] we think is designed to make us
[25:53] employees to make us pay taxes to make
[25:55] us not care about money I mean if you
[25:57] speak to someone who has done University
[25:59] and economy I mean
[26:02] bro seriously let's get no disrespect to
[26:05] anyone who has studied for hats off to
[26:08] them they've done whatever they've done
[26:10] but they understood nothing of economy
[26:12] like nothing because they've been
[26:14] brainwash with a an old system and this
[26:17] is what I would want as well if I would
[26:19] be the king like they saying in France
[26:23] mu presidant if I was the president
[26:25] sorry for my French accent I don't speak
[26:27] French but that's something I remember a
[26:29] friend says it all the time if I was the
[26:31] president I want people to be fat stupid
[26:34] and poor yeah of course that's that's
[26:36] the goal I don't want them to be fit
[26:38] smart and and Rich because that will
[26:41] mess me up I mean I wouldn't last a week
[26:43] as a king so I get it and you know like
[26:47] I said depends on how you look at the
[26:49] angle you are seeing the story right but
[26:52] I think it's important we we owe
[26:54] ourselves to say hey as far as I know I
[26:56] have one life time is my my favorite
[26:58] asset it goes even over Bitcoin I don't
[27:00] know if you've seen Michael sailor
[27:02] reposted a a poll that Mr Dell said uh
[27:06] do you prefer love Bitcoin I put love
[27:09] and passion whatever it was I think it
[27:11] goes over Bitcoin because to me love is
[27:13] for Bitcoin so in the end is a cycle but
[27:15] whatever I think time is my my favorite
[27:17] asset it goes above anything money above
[27:20] Bitcoin about time is everything because
[27:22] as far as I know I can't rewind it and
[27:25] it's also limited and I don't know when
[27:27] the cap is going to be so
[27:28] even trickier if I think about it but
[27:32] then we spend most of our time
[27:35] sleepwalking into a life that has been
[27:37] designed on top of us even the language
[27:39] you speak is a brainwash if you think
[27:41] about it like the way you say thank you
[27:43] the way you eat the food you eat uh the
[27:46] stuff you watch the music you listen all
[27:49] those things have been planted into our
[27:51] souls into our brains and the goal for
[27:55] me is to remove them as much as you can
[27:57] so if you can get to a point where you
[27:59] can deprogram yourself and start
[28:02] programming downloading programs you I
[28:04] don't know if you've seen the metrix one
[28:05] of my favorite movie I love can he he
[28:08] can decide to learn Kung Fu in a program
[28:10] I think we we are in that kind of phase
[28:12] where whatever you put in your in your
[28:14] brain you should be in charge of it but
[28:17] the reality is most people they like the
[28:19] autopilot they don't want to be in
[28:20] charge because it comes with
[28:21] responsibility right they prefer to
[28:23] blame on the government they blame and
[28:26] again not to go into politics but but
[28:28] there is people they think that voting
[28:30] makes a difference I mean it blows my
[28:32] mind it blows my mind you go to wherever
[28:35] every four years make an A and
[28:37] everything is going to be all right this
[28:39] is like so farfetch for me as a concept
[28:43] it's like a I can't even I mean I I've
[28:46] tried I've tried really extensively to
[28:48] think about why they believe that some
[28:50] puppet on TV is going to do something
[28:53] about it whether in fact there is
[28:55] corporations behind with money telling
[28:57] the president what they want but again
[28:59] if you if you say these things people
[29:01] think you are a conspiracy theorist and
[29:03] that's why Bitcoin is it takes away all
[29:06] I don't know if I can swear on the
[29:07] channel but it takes all the way the B
[29:09] all the BS is gone like there is no
[29:12] there is nothing else there is you and
[29:14] there is the asset and it's
[29:15] decentralized there is no CEO there is
[29:18] it's out in the open nobody controls it
[29:20] everyone is Satoshi you know you have
[29:22] the miners you have the nodes you have
[29:24] people they use it it's just open
[29:27] distributed beautifully decentralized
[29:29] but it's so farfetch from where we are
[29:31] now in society where people majority of
[29:34] people I think they buy Bitcoin now is
[29:35] because they want to make money that's
[29:37] what I think because that's the end the
[29:38] entry barrier of Bitcoin you buy Bitcoin
[29:41] because you want to become a millionaire
[29:43] because you've seen on the news the
[29:44] crypto is the space for you to buy
[29:46] Lamborghinis and Bugattis so you buy the
[29:48] Bitcoin you don't even know what it is
[29:49] you don't even read anything you don't
[29:52] listen to
[29:53] podcast then this thing drops 50% and
[29:56] you go holy what happened either you
[29:58] sell the bottom or you start documenting
[30:00] yourself and for those of whom they
[30:02] stick around they have to build some
[30:05] sort of an armor a conviction otherwise
[30:07] they'll go crazy because seeing your
[30:08] portfolio swinging I mean at the level
[30:11] that Bitcoin does you have to have
[30:14] something you hold right otherwise you
[30:17] go crazy and I think if you manage to go
[30:19] through that phase where you understood
[30:22] that this thing is the best thing you
[30:24] can possibly have in your life well then
[30:26] you have to deal with the fact that goes
[30:28] up and down but I think there is only a
[30:30] small percentage of us like you me and
[30:33] your your viewers your followers
[30:34] probably are well educated because they
[30:36] watch your podcast and your guests but
[30:38] we are a small percentage the majority
[30:40] of the people I I still go to the 8020
[30:42] which seem to be alow in life they just
[30:45] they for the time being they are in for
[30:48] the quick gains and maybe then if they
[30:50] do one cycle two and I was one of them
[30:52] I'm not I'm not saying I wasn't like the
[30:54] reason why I B Be coin in 2013 is
[30:56] because I wanted to become rich that's
[30:58] it but then you get dragged into a into
[31:01] the rabbit hole because you want to see
[31:03] how deep that is and then the change the
[31:06] story changes and you go okay I don't
[31:08] care about that anymore I mean I Want to
[31:10] Be Free eventually that's what money I
[31:13] think is used for to free yourself from
[31:15] whatever you do on a daily base and
[31:17] become whoever you want to be it's a
[31:19] tool you can use there's probably many
[31:20] others but the more you are invested
[31:22] with this thing the more you research
[31:24] the more you study it and we kind of
[31:26] cover it briefly on on on my show the
[31:28] less you care about the price down to a
[31:30] degree because it becomes clear that one
[31:33] Bitcoin is one Bitcoin but you can't go
[31:35] to someone who has never heard it who
[31:37] has never seen it say hey dude one
[31:39] bigcoin is one bigcoin yay he thinks you
[31:41] are complete
[31:44] crazy because he's so far away from that
[31:47] point of realization that there is no
[31:50] ground for him or her to understand what
[31:52] are this guys talking about are you
[31:54] crazy like there are people I spoke to I
[31:56] speak to on a daily basis and when I
[31:59] tell them like a simple questions like
[32:00] do you think your money are in the bank
[32:02] they just make the crazy face like this
[32:05] gu this guy's gone like honestly he's
[32:08] gone and they call me a scammer because
[32:10] I live in Dubai and I don't pay taxes
[32:12] and I'm like you know okay um I don't
[32:15] even know what to say like why am I
[32:16] scamming you because I live in Dubai and
[32:17] I don't pay taxes you can come too you
[32:19] know if you want so it's just
[32:24] like it's easy for people to build
[32:26] reasons why they shouldn't do stuff you
[32:29] do because they don't want
[32:32] to exit their comfort zone you know they
[32:34] don't want to leave the comfort zone
[32:35] traveling is a beautiful way to to get
[32:38] awaken as I say you know to understand
[32:41] hey the way how I do things is not the
[32:43] only way there's people in China where I
[32:45] live seven years they didn't even know
[32:47] who Jimmy andrix was and I was like how
[32:49] do you not know who Jimmy andrix is what
[32:52] but they go yeah but you don't know who
[32:54] Ching Lee is which is a fantastic
[32:56] violist and I'm like no I don't know but
[32:58] you don't know Jimmy andrick you know
[33:00] what I mean it's a different way to see
[33:02] life different way to experience living
[33:05] you know and if you don't expose
[33:06] yourself to those things I think you
[33:08] will you will miss out a beautiful point
[33:09] of view it's like watching your entire
[33:12] life from one angle exclusively from one
[33:15] angle but if you move your chair and you
[33:18] look at the room from the other side
[33:19] it's like holy there is a TV there there
[33:21] is a window there I didn't know that I
[33:23] think Bitcoin offers you that but you
[33:25] have to you have to let go you have to
[33:27] get to a point where you don't fight
[33:30] anymore you just like embrace it I don't
[33:33] know if it makes sense it makes a lot of
[33:35] sense and I don't think that those are
[33:38] conspiracy theories at this point like
[33:41] like the one the first thing I think you
[33:43] you said was the schools are designed to
[33:44] make you an employee and not someone
[33:47] that actually thinks for themselves um I
[33:50] mean they adverti that like they it's
[33:53] it's not a secret that they do that uh
[33:56] they like at least Austria I was going
[33:59] to uh the school before um university
[34:03] they said like oh then you have those
[34:05] jobs available you will be that kind of
[34:07] a person that makes those jobs like they
[34:10] don't even give you the route of being
[34:12] self-employed being and a company like
[34:15] that's not even in the realm of
[34:18] possibilities and then when uh when you
[34:21] like you graduate from school you're an
[34:24] an an employee who fulfills a task when
[34:27] you graduate from University you are
[34:29] employee that manages other other
[34:32] employees within the bigger system and
[34:35] that that that's how they designed that
[34:37] like they are at least in Austria not
[34:39] very secretive about that like you go in
[34:41] there you talk with the directors do you
[34:43] talk with the teachers there they are
[34:46] very like they say exactly that and I
[34:49] also say like if if you CH was one to
[34:51] have a normal job and you're like you're
[34:54] happy with with that going 9 to five uh
[34:57] do whatever someone else is and then
[34:59] from uh 5: to 9: in the morning you can
[35:02] do whatever you want it's okay it's it's
[35:05] not safe it's not a safe run like let's
[35:07] be clear that's that's not a safe thing
[35:09] like there are so many stories like you
[35:11] got unemployed and then you don't find a
[35:13] job for like years it's not a safe safe
[35:15] route it's just a comfortable route
[35:18] which can be very a hard can be very
[35:20] hard route uh but they are very open I
[35:23] feel like with that and it's not not a
[35:26] conspiracy
[35:27] I would not say it's a conspiracy but I
[35:29] I I know what you're saying I mean I
[35:32] think I I believe we're not alone in the
[35:34] universe I think there is definitely
[35:36] life out there somewhere and sometimes
[35:38] I'm thinking imagine if someone would
[35:40] come here and just look at us for like
[35:42] 20 minutes and observe how we operate as
[35:46] Society they will freak the hell out and
[35:48] that they'll come out with a conclusion
[35:50] which is people in charge are freaking
[35:52] awesome because they managed to create a
[35:55] situation where I mean there are people
[35:58] in charge of our health they are
[36:00] overweight like let that sink for a
[36:03] minute I mean I I don't care about fat
[36:05] shaming I'm sorry guys I'm being
[36:07] realistic here like imagine if you go to
[36:09] the gym and your personal trainer is
[36:13] super fat I mean would you would you
[36:16] trust the personal trainer fat well no
[36:18] because you are not giving me what I
[36:20] want I want the personal trainer to be
[36:23] freaking built and raped because that's
[36:25] what I want to be right so if you are
[36:27] fat you're not selling me the personal
[36:29] trainer Vibe I'm sorry but there is an
[36:30] image attached to it so it it's funny
[36:34] how everything works and school like you
[36:37] said I agree it's a messed up situation
[36:41] there is something I've read I think it
[36:43] was pom talking about it which was on my
[36:44] podcast and he said you have a fish and
[36:47] you have a monkey and you are judging
[36:49] them who's the fastest to climb a tree
[36:52] yeah okay of course the monkey is going
[36:53] to win but the fish swims faster so how
[36:56] can you have one task where you compare
[36:58] multiple brains I was terrible at school
[37:00] because the thing is I learn in
[37:02] different ways I hate reading books but
[37:04] I can absorb content via video and audio
[37:06] for hours so am I bad no I'm different
[37:10] so you can't have one box for everybody
[37:13] to fit into it and you cannot be
[37:15] rewarded to remember who the hell wants
[37:17] to remember things like you want to you
[37:20] want to learn how to solve problems you
[37:21] don't want to learn how to repeal
[37:22] problems so the old thing is designed if
[37:24] you ask me in a completely wrong way I
[37:27] was I was working when I was 14 so back
[37:30] then believe me it was legal in Italy at
[37:32] least and I've been around I traveled
[37:36] extensively I've lived everywhere and
[37:38] when I was in Ireland I flew back with
[37:40] one of my best friends which was Dutch
[37:43] and I thought okay I have many friends
[37:45] in my small village and they all went to
[37:48] school they all study English great I
[37:51] mean I didn't study anything I just went
[37:52] to Ireland I had a couple of beers and I
[37:54] was fluent in six months that was my
[37:56] school right
[37:58] and I I I went back to to Italy with my
[38:01] friend and all those graduates they
[38:03] couldn't even freaking say nothing
[38:05] because they were used to books and the
[38:08] English teacher is Italian I mean how
[38:10] crazy this is so and the teacher in
[38:14] Italian teaches English in Italian which
[38:16] is so messed up to so many different
[38:19] levels whether in fact if you look into
[38:21] who speaks really good English are
[38:23] countries where the movies are not
[38:25] changed there's no on the movies right
[38:28] so you are forced to learn the language
[38:31] if you want to watch a movie maybe there
[38:32] are subtitles which I argue they're not
[38:34] great but they help so your way to learn
[38:37] the language is basically one way so you
[38:40] have one Italian guy to who teaches to
[38:42] Italian people English and he speaks
[38:45] Italian half of the lesson maybe even
[38:47] 90% of the
[38:48] lesson whether I think there should be a
[38:50] guy who speaks no Italian into a class
[38:52] who goes English from this from the GGO
[38:56] right and I I get it is more aggressive
[38:58] but that's how you learn because
[38:59] otherwise you are not used to a
[39:02] confrontation if there is a test on a
[39:04] piece of paper you might be great but as
[39:06] soon as I have someone coming from a
[39:08] different country different accent maybe
[39:09] from Netherlands or IR Irish Ireland
[39:12] beautiful accent but it's tough to
[39:14] digest or even British to be honest you
[39:17] will look at them like they are speaking
[39:19] Arabic because you've never had that
[39:21] experience in your life so the and I
[39:24] don't want to say that whoever teaches
[39:25] English in Italian or in Italy
[39:27] is wrong but we have not improved
[39:31] anything period so there is there is a
[39:35] difference between be practical and be
[39:37] into Theory right and I think they are
[39:39] two very different universe and
[39:41] sometimes you just need to jump man you
[39:42] just need to jump in the mud because if
[39:44] you stay too much into
[39:46] the into the what ifs into the Practical
[39:49] side of it it's probably not good as
[39:51] well but I find if you want to learn you
[39:54] know it's like I I had people they said
[39:57] me oh don't go to China have you ever
[39:59] been there no but I've seen you've seen
[40:01] nothing man you have not been there so
[40:03] everything you think you know you don't
[40:06] it was someone else interpretation so
[40:09] I've been there I loved it seven years
[40:11] best things best thing I've done in my
[40:13] life I loved it but um why would you say
[40:17] I mean I have people in my network
[40:19] they've U never been anywhere they stay
[40:21] in my Valley I'm from the north side so
[40:23] near Lake Como in Switzerland and
[40:26] they'll tell you Italian food is the
[40:28] best food there is and I'm like okay
[40:29] what food have you tried you know to say
[40:32] something like this Italian food is the
[40:34] best food you ever experienced I'm
[40:37] expecting you to list me I don't know 10
[40:39] countries at least Where Have You Been
[40:41] yourself because if you if you try
[40:44] Chinese food in Italy that's not Chinese
[40:46] food my friend that's Italian Chinese
[40:48] you know what I mean oh I don't have to
[40:50] because uh cuz I know and that kind of
[40:54] ego position is not just with food is
[40:56] with money also like ah you don't know
[40:59] anything about money what's Bitcoin is a
[41:00] scam you don't even know what it is like
[41:03] oh but I've seen on TV that this guy
[41:04] Bill Gates hates it okay well great just
[41:07] because Bill Gates hates it then does it
[41:10] make it bad and the option to question
[41:13] yourself it's something we have when we
[41:16] are small when you are a small child you
[41:18] ask everything what is this what is that
[41:20] why this is doing this and then the more
[41:23] you become a grownup you lose that
[41:26] ability to question stuff and if there
[41:29] is one thing that I would like people to
[41:30] do is keep questioning it over and over
[41:32] and over why is this why am I broke what
[41:35] is money why banks have my money why can
[41:38] I not do these things then if you if you
[41:41] keep questioning things I think you live
[41:43] a very different life okay life it could
[41:45] be more stressful down to a degree I'm
[41:49] not saying it's not but at least you are
[41:52] I believe trying to become a better
[41:55] version of yourself because we see life
[41:57] from a different perspective and
[41:59] sometimes we forget that it's fine to
[42:01] disagree it's great hey if there's
[42:02] someone out there who Bel who thinks
[42:05] 100% that Fiat money is the best form of
[42:08] money there is great I mean I'm happy
[42:11] for them right so I'm not saying they
[42:14] have to take Bitcoin and they cannot use
[42:15] f you you do you man I'll do me but at
[42:19] least you should get to the conclusion
[42:21] only after you've invested 200 hours or
[42:25] something like Michael saor says if you
[42:27] spend 200 hours in study
[42:29] Bitcoin then we can have a conversation
[42:32] if you don't even look into the white
[42:33] paper which is nine freaking Pages by
[42:35] the way nine pages into a PDF well then
[42:39] I don't even want to have a conversation
[42:41] I don't think because then your point is
[42:44] so farfetch from reality I kind of I'm
[42:48] going somewhere here I'm rumbling a lot
[42:50] but I think you I think you know what I
[42:51] mean with this right you have to to put
[42:53] some some work if you want to have a
[42:55] proper conversation you know thank you
[42:58] you already made it halfway through the
[42:59] video and I'm really really grateful to
[43:02] have you here two things make this
[43:04] channel possible you as a watcher and
[43:06] listener who keep supporting this
[43:08] Channel and another one is all the
[43:10] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[43:13] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[43:15] very start and where I personally buy my
[43:17] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[43:19] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[43:21] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[43:25] simplest and securest way to to secure
[43:27] your Bitcoin and I heard a crazy
[43:29] statistics only 2% of bitcoiners hold
[43:32] their Bitcoin in a hardware wallet how
[43:34] crazy is that don't be in that 98%
[43:38] bracket be in the 2% bracket and if you
[43:40] have self- custody and you know your
[43:42] friend does not have maybe he needs a
[43:44] Christmas present maybe he needs a
[43:45] birthday present and a small life hack
[43:47] if you use code Robin you get 5% off
[43:50] your order plus you support my channel
[43:53] and now let's get back to the video I
[43:55] feel like it's uh connected to being a
[43:58] truthful
[43:59] person like if you are saying something
[44:02] because you heard one thing on the news
[44:04] or like you picked up like the example
[44:07] you be like oh I heard Bill Gates
[44:09] doesn't like it Al so I I don't want to
[44:11] take waste my time with it like you're
[44:13] not being truthful to yourself you're
[44:15] being lazy that's why you don't like it
[44:19] uh and the the moment when you start
[44:21] being truthful to yourself you have to
[44:24] ask those questions you always uh you
[44:27] you have to question what are things
[44:30] what is money what is that what is that
[44:32] and then all of the sudden you you come
[44:34] to it's a as you said it's it's
[44:37] sometimes a more stressful life uh
[44:39] because all of the sudden you have to do
[44:41] homework you have to do really diving
[44:43] deep uh you have to do things that you
[44:45] you maybe don't want to do uh because
[44:48] it's it's it's a nice laugh if if you're
[44:50] just like be in The Matrix 24/7 you work
[44:54] your 9 to5 you come home watch your
[44:56] Netflix
[44:57] go to
[44:58] bed then stand up again and do the same
[45:01] thing all over have five weeks of
[45:03] holidays a year drive to uh Croatia
[45:07] increase two times a year and and and
[45:09] and do this like till till you're 17 and
[45:11] you die so like that's comfortable it's
[45:16] it's it's my version of hell like I
[45:18] would never love that but but other
[45:21] people would like that uh and it's the
[45:24] moment when you start being a truthful
[45:26] person a lot of things change and this
[45:28] is also my next question for you
[45:29] actually when you say all the things
[45:33] that are not directly uh related to
[45:37] bitcoin uh did you get that already
[45:39] before Bitcoin because you you said like
[45:41] you're 50 or yeah I'm I'm 47 yeah this
[45:45] year oh 47 yeah you look really way
[45:49] young like I was like oh probably like
[45:51] 35 or something like that thank you I
[45:54] wish but uh when you you um talk about
[45:58] all that things did you discover that
[46:00] before Bitcoin and Bitcoin came in and
[46:02] like it was this puzzle beef that was a
[46:04] little bit missing or did you actually
[46:05] started critical thinking because of
[46:08] Bitcoin no I mean everything was kind of
[46:11] a puzzle in a way it's funny because
[46:14] when you do puzzle you have a you have a
[46:16] strategy of puzzle you do the Border
[46:17] first whatever people do these days I
[46:19] don't know but um I didn't know what I
[46:21] was doing I was just putting pieces on
[46:22] the board you know kind of trying to
[46:23] puzzle my life and everything kind of
[46:25] started of pure fear so I thought
[46:30] traveling and running away from who I
[46:33] was uh I had a really bad breakup and I
[46:36] didn't know what to do I had a business
[46:38] I wanted to sell so I sold my business
[46:40] and I travel to Ireland thinking I'm
[46:42] going to leave me so whatever happened
[46:44] to me my ex-girlfriend the company I
[46:47] didn't like anymore it's gone and now
[46:49] I'm going to become a new person which
[46:50] is not what happens by the way Bob
[46:52] Marley said beautifully you cannot run
[46:54] away from yourself so
[46:57] problems are going to come so what I
[46:59] experienced a few months of yay amazing
[47:01] I'm in Ireland everything is new new
[47:03] people new language new everything and
[47:05] then a few months later they come and
[47:06] knock and they are bigger demons because
[47:08] you left them and they were working out
[47:10] in the gym you know so my old experience
[47:14] which has been I travel a lot I lived in
[47:16] many places in many countries and it was
[47:19] out of fear because I I thought I I
[47:21] could I could run away from everything
[47:23] and then at some point I I had to face
[47:26] everything in one go and that destroyed
[47:28] me because the more you wait the more
[47:31] the obstacle is going to become
[47:33] difficult to overcome so then one day I
[47:35] have to pay the bill because you have to
[47:37] pay the bill is inevitable and then that
[47:41] destroyed me completely and this is
[47:44] important because I think I've never met
[47:46] anyone who has been acknowledging of
[47:50] something it can be your body it can be
[47:54] let's say if you are not in shape or you
[47:56] are broke or you don't like your job or
[47:59] you don't like your partner if there's
[48:02] something you really want to change and
[48:04] you put the mindset into it it's
[48:06] impossible not to be successful I I I
[48:08] don't I don't believe it I I refuse to
[48:10] believe that if you do really say I want
[48:13] to change this because I want to make a
[48:16] better whatever marriage job uh I don't
[48:20] want to be broke anymore you can there
[48:23] is a lot there's going to be a lot of
[48:25] hard work to do you have to put energy
[48:26] in time but what do you think you become
[48:28] so when you wake up in the morning I
[48:31] think it's your responsibility to make
[48:33] sure that ay you are happy with whatever
[48:35] you've got and maybe happiness it's
[48:36] different for different people like if
[48:39] you are that kind of guy or girl who
[48:41] wants to have one job one partner go on
[48:43] holid in the same place forever and ever
[48:46] great but there's the difference in
[48:48] between knowing it versus accepting it
[48:52] that's a very different thing so if you
[48:54] wake up consciously and you say I love
[48:57] my life because I do and I'm in The
[48:59] Matrix well then great in the movie by
[49:01] the way the guy wanted to go back into
[49:03] it you know that's the example was it
[49:05] Cipher the name of the guy so hey if you
[49:08] are the guy who wants to go back in The
[49:09] Matrix great but you have to be
[49:11] conscious of it right so that's my point
[49:14] and I think if you do the work if you do
[49:16] the homework you don't want to go back
[49:17] into it because you know what's inside
[49:20] but if you truly want to go back into it
[49:22] I respect you the people I don't respect
[49:25] are the people they a lie to themselves
[49:27] saying oh no this is what I want because
[49:29] I don't want to change anything about it
[49:31] and changes by the way it's it's the
[49:33] number one constant to stay in Balance
[49:37] Einstein said right so I agree you have
[49:39] to embrace changes you have to leave
[49:41] your comfort zone you have to learn new
[49:43] things and Bitcoin came in in a point
[49:46] where I I've always I was always looking
[49:49] for that one thing which would have
[49:51] ground me down uh financially and also
[49:54] mentally and I struggled finding it and
[49:57] I've done a lot of research and I've
[50:00] done so many things you know Bitcoin
[50:03] wasn't the first thing I found it just
[50:05] came to me and when I encountered it I
[50:08] didn't even know what it was I mean I
[50:09] would live I say oh I've been looking
[50:11] for this thing and researching no I just
[50:12] bought it because I want to make money
[50:14] like uh the first thing I thought was
[50:16] like okay I'm gonna buy this I'm gonna
[50:17] be a millionaire in two years that's
[50:19] that's the mindset because sadly the
[50:21] most attractive property for Bitcoin as
[50:24] we speak I think it's money and price
[50:27] and this is where people are being
[50:28] attracted to this thing oh you seen the
[50:30] news oh Bitcoin the person who bought
[50:33] Bitcoin at 50 cents is now a
[50:35] multimillion whether in reality those
[50:36] people don't even exist anymore because
[50:38] if you purchase an asset for 20 cents
[50:40] and we are now at $60,000 you sold most
[50:44] likely most of it at $100 not even at
[50:48] Thousand because when you see so much
[50:50] return unless you had so many and or
[50:53] unless you lost it and you found it back
[50:55] again which is a different story story
[50:57] there is no data around this but I would
[50:59] love to see the percentage of people
[51:02] they purchase Bitcoin in 201 2012 even
[51:05] 2013 down to a degree and they still
[51:08] have some it will be super low I think
[51:11] that's my opinion so money and
[51:15] gains still is the most attractive part
[51:18] of it for now but that could very much
[51:21] change maybe it will be portability
[51:22] maybe it will be ownership maybe it will
[51:24] be something else but as we speak I
[51:26] think people
[51:27] will get to the Bitcoin train because
[51:30] they want to they want to make quick
[51:32] profits so it wasn't the first thing I
[51:34] found it just manifested when I was
[51:37] ready to receive it if it makes sense
[51:40] it's uh it's fascinating to see those
[51:42] stories uh when when you see those
[51:44] Bitcoin stories and I heard so many
[51:46] already and uh there are those who where
[51:49] Bitcoin actually triggered something
[51:51] they because they never question
[51:53] anything in their life and then Bitcoin
[51:55] came in the Life usually because of n Go
[51:57] technology and then all of the sudden
[51:59] they're like oh my whole life I did not
[52:04] see what money actually is and then they
[52:06] go like what else is wrong what what
[52:08] else can I question and then they go in
[52:10] all those different rabbit holes and
[52:13] it's a it's a beautiful thing uh when
[52:15] you have when you have that but like
[52:18] that's one of my small hopes I don't
[52:21] think it will be uh true uh but it's was
[52:23] small hope that more people find Bitcoin
[52:26] and with that people actually realize
[52:28] the potential of it and then also
[52:30] questioning other things all of the
[52:32] sudden and coming in a proof of work
[52:34] mindset that you have to put in
[52:36] something the The Becoming Brave they're
[52:37] doing something the questioning other
[52:39] things like but I probably like most
[52:42] people will stay
[52:43] ignorant that's that's unfortunate the
[52:45] truth I think yeah the ego is gonna is
[52:48] going to slow you down because you have
[52:50] to say to yourself I was wrong like I
[52:53] that's one of the most difficult thing
[52:54] there is a there is a story
[52:57] about a dog and and a piece of metal
[53:00] which is kind of bothering the dog and
[53:02] the dog is sitting at the park and there
[53:04] is two old people looking at the dog and
[53:06] the dog is in pain right so dog is
[53:08] sitting on a piece of metal a spike kind
[53:10] of in his bump and one said to the other
[53:13] why the dog is not moving and the other
[53:16] one said well it's not hurting him
[53:17] enough like we get comfortable with pain
[53:21] pain becomes easy to oh yeah well it is
[53:24] what it is right like at the end of the
[53:26] day I got I have a job I pay taxes my
[53:28] marriage is sh terrible I don't like my
[53:31] job but hey you know it is what it is
[53:33] let me get a beer and get drunk so I
[53:35] forget that's kind of the average right
[53:38] people are trying to use whatever free
[53:41] time they have which is next to nothing
[53:43] to use alcohol drugs whatever to forget
[53:48] their reality whether in fact if they
[53:50] would work on it like it's like if you
[53:54] take a piece of paper and you say what
[53:55] is that I like
[53:57] as as a human being what what is it I
[53:59] love I love swimming I love the sun I
[54:04] love what dogs and then you live in
[54:06] London which always rains you never swim
[54:09] there's never Sun well then you have the
[54:11] answer move like just go where the sun
[54:14] is shining and whether is a pool or a
[54:16] sea you can swim into it but again it's
[54:19] the ego like we forget that we are
[54:22] capable to do whatever we want and we
[54:24] imagine and I'm not talking about love
[54:26] of
[54:27] attractions I'm just saying practical
[54:30] things you wake up in the morning and
[54:32] you freaking put the back into it right
[54:34] like you you want a better body go to
[54:36] the freaking gym right and and and lift
[54:40] if you do so and if you eat well and you
[54:42] go and do workout you cannot be fat is
[54:45] is imp and by the way I don't have
[54:47] anything against fat people by the way
[54:49] but all I'm saying is if you've got
[54:51] something if you want to if you are
[54:53] broke and you want to be
[54:57] not broke then make a plan okay start by
[55:01] counting how much money you spend right
[55:03] how much money you make you can't be
[55:05] broke like it's impossible you can only
[55:08] be broke if you do nothing about it like
[55:10] if you keep doing what you're doing if
[55:11] you keep spending money you don't even
[55:12] know credit cards and stuff you can't
[55:15] afford money you don't have well then
[55:17] you'll be broke but the minute you say
[55:18] no I want to be in charge of my economy
[55:22] forget Bitcoin forget investing just
[55:25] take a pie piece of paper and say how
[55:27] much does it cost me to live in my city
[55:31] how much money I make how much my life
[55:34] cost me you know when you ask this
[55:35] question to people they just don't even
[55:36] know I don't know what do you mean you
[55:38] don't know like of course you're broke I
[55:41] mean if you don't have a plan if you
[55:43] don't know how much is costing you to
[55:45] stay on this planet well then you have a
[55:49] problem right there but again like you
[55:52] said it's laziness it's a kind of story
[55:55] oh but well you know I'll tell you a
[55:57] funny one I used to smoke a lot of
[55:59] cigarettes I was heavy smoker like chain
[56:01] smoker Italians they love cigarettes I
[56:03] love nicotine I smoked for a long
[56:06] time and one day I said no one day I
[56:08] said I woke up I was coughing blood I
[56:10] was like okay that's it I'm I'm done and
[56:13] called called I said no more cigarettes
[56:15] all my friends they hated it because
[56:18] they were all
[56:19] smokers and when I was in London going
[56:21] out or in China China is even worse I
[56:24] was the living reminder they could also
[56:26] quit if they wanted because I've done it
[56:27] well Marcio has done it so that means I
[56:30] can too decide not to smoke so what was
[56:33] the reaction to me trying to make me a
[56:35] smoker yeah smoke one it's just just one
[56:37] man come on it's just one it doesn't
[56:39] doesn't hurt you are Tipsy you had a
[56:41] couple of beers just one because they it
[56:44] was so uncomfortable for them to see me
[56:47] not smoking they rather see me smoking
[56:49] again so your network people you have
[56:52] around you and by the way they are not
[56:54] evil people they are my friends but
[56:57] people you go out with they Define who
[56:59] you are so if you are broke if you are
[57:03] unhappy besides the work you have to do
[57:05] on yourself I would also encourage you
[57:07] to look around you and see who's around
[57:09] you because if you have successful
[57:10] people and healthy people and you are
[57:12] fat and
[57:13] broke it's not goingon to it's not
[57:16] possible like you cannot have five
[57:19] people in your network you see
[57:20] consistently they have what you want
[57:23] it's not going to be like this most
[57:24] likely The Five People You See the most
[57:26] are going to be fat and broke right so
[57:30] and this is the most difficult part and
[57:32] by the way I'm keep giving the fat and
[57:34] broke example because it's the only it's
[57:36] the faster to understand I have nothing
[57:38] against either but all I'm saying is
[57:40] people you spend time with that will
[57:42] affect your mindset and it's hard to
[57:45] break it because maybe those people have
[57:47] been around since forever but um I had
[57:50] gck on my podcast and he said if you
[57:52] have two rockets such a beautiful thing
[57:54] he said and they move move one cm a year
[58:00] in 50 years they are completely apart so
[58:03] the person you are today in your 40s 20s
[58:06] 50s it's a very different
[58:09] person about I don't know if you compare
[58:11] it to the child version version of
[58:14] yourself some people say to me all the
[58:16] time oh you've changed so much you've
[58:18] done so I'm so grateful of that because
[58:19] otherwise I'll be the same freaking
[58:21] person having around people they will
[58:24] encourage you to do crazy stuff I think
[58:26] it's the number one and we forget
[58:28] sometime how important that is because
[58:31] they will drag you down as well as maybe
[58:35] lift you up right depends on what kind
[58:36] of people and I found a big to go back
[58:39] to bitcoin the more I speak with people
[58:41] like you the more I I encounter people
[58:45] with I'm not saying someone who's like I
[58:49] mean people like you like proper bonor
[58:51] the people they do the work they do a
[58:53] podcast they have their Network into it
[58:55] like me like I'm not faking anything
[58:57] it's just that's how I live there is a
[59:01] common ground there which is rooted into
[59:04] our mindset which is deeper than ah
[59:07] we're gonna make money and it's it's all
[59:10] about Freedom it's all about core
[59:13] living kind of DNA mentality it's like
[59:17] most likely you're going to be an
[59:18] entrepreneur if you are a bitcoiner most
[59:20] likely you're someone who traveled who
[59:22] experienced life in a different way
[59:24] because it's such a risky thing to do
[59:26] that is going to become appealing to
[59:28] someone who has done certain things
[59:30] right whether if you are someone super
[59:32] conservative you never traveled you
[59:34] never done anything it's going to be
[59:36] difficult to understand so it's an easy
[59:39] way to actually find people tuned on
[59:41] your wave if it makes sense I don't know
[59:43] if you also experience it by like one
[59:45] thing I really want to say to that um if
[59:48] if someone is fat we should be able to
[59:51] call them
[59:52] out it's like um because
[59:56] it it it's not U it's not a healthy
[59:59] thing to do it it's it's if someone has
[60:03] a knife hanging out of the shoulder I
[60:06] would tell him and if if there's
[60:08] something wrong with with your body you
[60:11] you have to tell him oh like that that's
[60:14] not like I saw this video uh on on on
[60:17] Twitter I think like today or maybe
[60:20] yesterday uh there is in the Grand
[60:22] Canyon uh there are like routs where you
[60:25] can go and you can explore them and you
[60:27] can walk there and they check they check
[60:29] your weight because you can yeah I've
[60:31] seen it as well yes and and you have to
[60:33] go through two bowls and if you cannot
[60:36] go through those bowls then you cannot
[60:38] go there because it's just that small
[60:40] and people are like oh we have to make
[60:42] them bigger we have to destroy basically
[60:44] nature so so fat people can go there or
[60:48] like oh that's fat phobic or what like
[60:50] no that's that that's nature and people
[60:53] that cannot go through that thing
[60:56] they they probably have to do something
[60:58] on themselves and there is something
[61:00] like um a sickness to fatness like
[61:03] there's some some bad thing like because
[61:07] a friend of mine also happened she had
[61:09] fat on her body that she cannot get rid
[61:12] how no matter how much she drains that's
[61:15] a different story but 99% of the people
[61:19] that the overweight don't have that
[61:22] disease and even this disease you can
[61:24] get rid of but it's cost a lot of money
[61:26] and you get a doctor involved in all
[61:27] that stuff U but 99% of them they are um
[61:33] bigger because they have usually
[61:35] something mentally like they have some
[61:36] addiction like the the best way probably
[61:40] to them would be going to do a
[61:42] psychology someone to get disciplined
[61:45] whatever like I I I don't want to get
[61:46] too deep in that but I think um we have
[61:49] to get to the truth and be truthful to
[61:51] ourselves and and to other people and
[61:53] never be rude to them like that's I
[61:54] think that's like always
[61:56] uh spread your message with with love
[61:58] and spread your message being kind and
[62:01] not like oh you're a fat you should do
[62:03] something no that's that's wrong on you
[62:05] uh but but saying something about that
[62:08] and and and and and trying to help them
[62:10] there's nothing wrong with that and and
[62:12] we have to acknowledge that being
[62:15] overweight is not a good thing like like
[62:18] that we should not normalize being not
[62:21] healthy I I agree that that that's super
[62:23] well said it goes beyond like body
[62:26] weight or body fat it goes into mental
[62:29] mentally as well you can you can be
[62:31] unhealthy and by the way you can be
[62:33] skinny and equally be unhealthy or you
[62:35] can not be fit like there are things we
[62:38] are doing as a as a society kind of
[62:43] humans into society they are not healthy
[62:45] at all right so I think I think all
[62:48] those things should be called out like I
[62:50] I I grew up in a place where my dad
[62:52] would slap the hell out of me if I was
[62:55] watching TV while having dinner and now
[62:57] there's people with cell phone
[62:58] everywhere you know like so it's not
[63:00] just body weight it's it's unhealthy
[63:02] things it's unhealthy thinking why do
[63:05] you have a thought in your mind that is
[63:07] going to block you to become a better
[63:09] version of yourself but take it off like
[63:11] it could be anything like nowadays I am
[63:14] so careful the amount of time I spend
[63:17] with people because most of the people I
[63:18] spend time with when I go out dinner
[63:20] they check their cell phone and I'm like
[63:22] hey dude hello I mean it's supposed to
[63:25] you and me I've not seting for a month
[63:27] and I'm dating your cell phone now like
[63:29] what's going on there so I agree we
[63:31] should call it out because now there is
[63:33] this kind of social media image which is
[63:37] faked as opposed to what you do in real
[63:39] life you want to show everything off and
[63:42] that's why Bitcoin helps me grounding
[63:44] myself so deeply because I feel like
[63:47] it's it's a way of living it's like it's
[63:50] like this this Bitcoin standard that we
[63:53] are talking about like I I don't have I
[63:55] don't have next to I have nothing in in
[63:58] my bank account funny thing when I moved
[63:59] to Dubai they said to me ah be careful
[64:01] Dubai because if you something happens
[64:03] to you uh the bank is not I'm like the
[64:06] bank bro no worries about my bank I have
[64:09] enough money to survive maybe a couple
[64:11] of months that's it everything else is
[64:14] secured in in in Bitcoin I don't even
[64:17] have it on me by the way because last
[64:19] thing I want is to be a YouTuber and let
[64:21] people know I have bigcoin so I can come
[64:23] in my house with a hammer like a $2
[64:25] attack you know no it's it's multi- it's
[64:28] safe you can do whatever you want to me
[64:29] I don't have it on me so I'm sorry and
[64:32] by the way my wife is very well aware so
[64:35] something happens to me and if I had
[64:37] money in the bank millions of dollars in
[64:39] Dubai I mean first of all I don't have
[64:41] it the bank has it and then good luck in
[64:43] moving it taking it out converting into
[64:45] Euros whatever she wants to go maybe so
[64:48] it becomes that thing who reminds you
[64:51] about total control and every time I I
[64:54] buy Bitcoin which I do monthly by the
[64:56] way I don't care about the price I just
[64:58] buy my my DCA into it it reminds me I'm
[65:02] in charge and I'm saying it with the
[65:05] smallest amount of egos possible not in
[65:07] a sense that I'm the boss I'm super cool
[65:10] no I decide today like this morning I
[65:13] woke up I went to the gym my trainer
[65:16] messed me up so shout out to Brad I've
[65:19] just started by the way I've never been
[65:21] fit in my life so it's a new thing I I
[65:24] went to the gym I came to the studio
[65:26] I've recorded a bunch of live shows I'm
[65:28] doing the this podcast and today when
[65:30] I'm driving back home I'm going to say
[65:31] to myself this is the day I wanted
[65:34] because it's true otherwise we wouldn't
[65:36] have done it and anyone can get to a
[65:40] point where they design the life they
[65:42] want and everything starts at least from
[65:45] me for this grounding conviction which
[65:47] is Bitcoin is going to allow me to you
[65:50] know it grounds me down because I know I
[65:53] am in charge of
[65:56] everything but I also get it for some
[65:58] people could be scary because you know
[66:00] when you take
[66:01] control well then is on you and if you
[66:04] if you take the wrong turn and you get
[66:06] lost then who else to blame I mean you
[66:09] can blame the weather the government you
[66:12] can blame your friends you can blame
[66:14] your parents you can blame society you
[66:15] can blame anything you want but at the
[66:18] end of the day it's on human man that's
[66:21] what I think so and do not let anyone
[66:25] tell you otherwise because you are
[66:27] indeed the universe so you can change
[66:30] whatever you want it requires discipline
[66:32] this morning I woke up at 5:30 I didn't
[66:34] want to go to the gym man honestly I
[66:35] wanted to stay in bed and kiss my wife
[66:37] and maybe make love whatever and cutle
[66:39] the cats but I went to the gym and I I
[66:42] I'm grateful I've done it but um you got
[66:45] to put to work so that's the part where
[66:48] most people struggle with because you
[66:51] know funny thing is when you go on
[66:53] social media and you see
[66:56] beautiful body you see people with money
[66:57] you see success the dopamine you receive
[67:01] is the same amount of dopamine you have
[67:02] if you experience it yourself so out of
[67:06] a sudden it
[67:07] becomes much more convenient to get
[67:10] dopamine from other people you know what
[67:12] I mean as opposed to get your own
[67:16] dopamine it's the same effect by the way
[67:17] that's why they're so powerful because
[67:19] you can experience like there is so many
[67:21] people I know in my life they actually
[67:23] watch people working out and they do
[67:25] nothing and they think they're working
[67:26] out you know I'm like that's not how it
[67:29] works or you see like a rich people a
[67:32] person on a plane private jet Rolexes
[67:35] and you are experiencing the same
[67:36] dopamine as if you were doing it but
[67:39] it's not the same thing because you're
[67:40] not on that plane and by the way I
[67:43] spoken with so many successful people
[67:45] and if there is one thing they all say
[67:47] to me is the most beautiful part was to
[67:51] get the money or to get the success it's
[67:53] like I know it's like a cliche but the
[67:55] journey is not the destination so once
[67:59] you get to a point where you have all
[68:00] the money you want and all the success
[68:01] you want well then you need to find
[68:04] something to do because the most
[68:05] beautiful part was the path to Freedom
[68:08] if you see what I mean
[68:09] so and and if you are in a place where
[68:12] by the way if you are someone who's
[68:13] listening who's watching who doesn't
[68:15] know what do you like uh what do you
[68:18] want this is a fantastic place to be
[68:21] because you can try anything like it's
[68:23] one of the most Gary V says it all the
[68:25] time a lot
[68:25] he says if you don't know who you are
[68:28] this is the most exciting place to be
[68:31] because you can figure it out as simple
[68:32] as that I love it so much um I love our
[68:36] talk a lot right now we over all already
[68:39] over the hour and then it's it's it's
[68:41] great um I had like like five six more
[68:45] topics that I want to go go in with you
[68:46] but I think I I just na down like one
[68:49] final topic and we can make a second dra
[68:51] in like half a year or something like
[68:53] that uh and the final top IC I would
[68:56] love to go within and you mention it so
[68:58] many times with in that podcast that you
[69:01] moved around a lot like I heard UK
[69:04] London I heard Dubai I heard Switzerland
[69:07] uh I think you're from Italian
[69:09] originally like just from the things
[69:11] that I heard in the podcast you moved
[69:13] around a lot China also heard I think
[69:15] what is the most beautiful place you
[69:17] have been and where do you think is the
[69:20] most Freedom where can you find the most
[69:23] freedom I love this so
[69:26] I think it depends on what time or what
[69:29] moment in your life so there are
[69:30] destinations that are more appealing to
[69:32] a younger crowd for example and there
[69:34] are destinations where more appealing to
[69:37] older crowds um for example I've um I
[69:40] experience Redmond which is next to
[69:42] Seattle I was working for Microsoft and
[69:44] they sent me there I hated it because I
[69:47] was a 27 years old and only thing he had
[69:50] was trees Bears families and nature now
[69:53] I would love it probably because I met
[69:55] married and I love trees and I love
[69:58] bears so but back then I want I was 27 I
[70:01] wanted to drink shots of tequila and
[70:03] find a lady to spend you know months
[70:06] years with I was single right so I think
[70:09] it depends on where you are with your
[70:10] mindset if there was a for example Dubai
[70:15] it's fantastic I think if you have if
[70:18] you come with a plan so if you come here
[70:23] especially being a male a single man H
[70:25] it would be it would be difficult I I
[70:27] heard people they can't find a companion
[70:30] and it's Lads of people with money and
[70:35] everything moves around how much stuff
[70:36] you've got and whether I don't
[70:38] experience any of that I love to buy
[70:40] because I have a a different
[70:43] setup so I think the overall place if
[70:47] there was like a a chart for example
[70:51] from 1 to 10 I I love Japan Japan was
[70:54] one of my favorite but as a foreigner as
[70:58] a guy G as they call us which means
[71:00] Foreigner but as a Japanese person in
[71:03] Japan they probably have different
[71:04] opinions I don't know I I loved it
[71:06] because it was more clean more organized
[71:09] more you know I'm I'm that kind of guy
[71:12] whether China was uh something
[71:14] completely different like a lot of more
[71:16] cows and stuff everywhere and where
[71:20] Japan was more organized more kind of
[71:22] more Switzerland Singapore is beautiful
[71:24] place as well but I think Japan is
[71:26] probably taking the crown
[71:28] overall and also this was 18 years ago
[71:31] so 18 years ago
[71:33] being like an European guy in Asia was
[71:37] something you know people stop you in
[71:39] the street take photos and all the
[71:41] ladies were coming say hello not in a
[71:43] sexual way by the way they just wanted
[71:45] to know who the hell is this guy coming
[71:48] from Italy or Europe I mean I've never
[71:51] seen one of them before so it was
[71:53] actually interesting I've experienced I
[71:55] call it Reverse Racism but not in a bad
[71:58] way because um I came to understand why
[72:01] for example when I was in China which
[72:04] was 18 years ago I couldn't go into some
[72:06] places but not because they didn't like
[72:08] me it's because they didn't have
[72:09] insurance so if something would have
[72:11] happened to the building which lots of
[72:13] fire in Shanghai by the way and I would
[72:15] have died they would have been all in
[72:17] trouble because they they killed a
[72:18] foreigner right so there is always a
[72:21] reason down deep and if you stop to the
[72:24] surface and if you don't dig deep enough
[72:26] you will judge come to a conclusion
[72:29] which is not the conclusion if you see
[72:31] what I mean so I'll probably say to
[72:33] answer your question Japan um but any
[72:37] place I've been and been a lot I've
[72:40] taken something from it like um Irish
[72:43] people are probably my absolute favorite
[72:45] I think it's the most sexy accent for a
[72:47] Woman by the way people don't understand
[72:48] it but when I I hear an Irish lady I
[72:52] melt I don't know why I just super sexy
[72:56] and people are great Lads of green
[72:58] nature I mean everything has always
[73:01] something to offer um I think beauty is
[73:03] in the eye of the be older so if you
[73:05] want to find beauty you'll find it
[73:07] everywhere for now Dubai I love it it's
[73:09] a great place to be it's not forever
[73:12] nothing is always forever but it's a
[73:14] phase it's a phase in it's a chapter in
[73:16] a book and now I'm enjoying it I don't
[73:19] know how long I'm going to stay here um
[73:22] I don't think about it anymore I just
[73:24] live my life life on you know in the
[73:26] moment I'm really grateful I kind of
[73:28] decided to live like this and like you
[73:31] said you you said something earlier
[73:33] about hell right it's the same for me
[73:35] like um and by the way I I'm well aware
[73:38] that my lifestyle and the stuff that
[73:40] I've done in my in my age and everything
[73:42] it's not for everybody I know like and
[73:45] it's great we have diff we have to be
[73:47] different we want different things but
[73:49] the main thing I think you should do is
[73:51] ask yourself what is that I want you
[73:54] know
[73:56] and as long as you have an honest answer
[73:58] if the answer is staying in one place
[74:00] going on vacation in the same spot
[74:03] having the same car having the same
[74:04] house and you really truly want it then
[74:06] great most of the time that's not the
[74:09] answer becomes comfortable so long story
[74:12] short I'll say Japan is probably the one
[74:14] who would tick most of the boxes but it
[74:16] was 18 years ago I have not gone back
[74:18] ever since maybe things have changed I
[74:21] actually I tried but when I booked
[74:22] ticket for Kyoto I want to take my wife
[74:25] a pandemic happened so we couldn't go
[74:28] this is 2021 so now that we are closer
[74:31] uh because Japan is closer from Dubai
[74:33] then from London I think we will go
[74:36] maybe next April when there is a blossom
[74:38] season everything goes pink beautiful
[74:41] and then I I'll be able to re revisit it
[74:44] almost 20 years later so I'm sure things
[74:47] have changed in 20 years I would
[74:50] imagine it's uh it's a cool Insight I I
[74:54] asked that question more more in the
[74:56] podcast what's the what is the most
[74:58] beautiful places you have been and and I
[75:00] think it I hopeful hopefully I Inspire
[75:03] some people in the audience to like
[75:04] consider other places consider other um
[75:08] destinations to be and think a little
[75:10] bit outside of of your own uh country um
[75:14] before we come to the end routine uh
[75:16] what can we learn from you besides
[75:19] Bitcoin and all the things that we
[75:20] already discussed today I'd probably say
[75:22] stay humble and St SS
[75:25] it's my favorite my favorite phrase but
[75:29] I would say get out there make mistake
[75:32] learn things fell fast fell forward
[75:35] because at the end of the day if you
[75:37] don't if you don't put your face in the
[75:38] mud you're not going to learn anything
[75:41] uh so the best thing I've um I've
[75:44] probably done in my life was to decided
[75:47] to pack and move because it's very
[75:48] practical it's going to give you you are
[75:50] alone into a foreigner country you don't
[75:52] speak the language your mom is not there
[75:54] your friends are not there your brother
[75:56] is not there and you have to wake up
[76:00] quick and fast so I would say Break
[76:04] Stuff go explore you know try to see
[76:09] life in moments as opposed to because
[76:12] that changes everything
[76:14] like it's so it's so crazy that I mean I
[76:18] I could be gone in any minute like I
[76:20] don't know what's going to happen with
[76:21] my life and the idea of being maybe even
[76:25] aware maybe one day I will be in a bed
[76:28] somewhere and I know I have a few months
[76:31] left to leave and the idea there is
[76:34] stuff that I wanted to do and I not done
[76:36] them it would it would kill me inside
[76:38] you know so if you've got that kind of
[76:41] voice into your stomach or into your
[76:43] soul that says to you I would like to do
[76:46] that thing you owe it to yourself to do
[76:48] it whatever that might be you know I
[76:50] mean as long as you don't arm anybody so
[76:52] don't go out and just do damage because
[76:54] that's not cool but if you stay
[76:56] respectful and if you you know if you
[76:58] don't damage anything or anyone and you
[77:00] want to genuinely explore because at the
[77:02] end of today it's just like this is why
[77:04] I have my podcast like I I genuinely
[77:07] love doing these things so that's why
[77:09] I'm doing them and and sometimes the the
[77:12] simplest thing you can ask yourself is
[77:14] what is it I like to do you know and if
[77:17] you don't know well then great go and
[77:19] experience things and just do stuff you
[77:21] know go and ride a horse swim into the
[77:24] ocean you know get naked and Sumo
[77:26] someone whatever it is that you want to
[77:28] do just do it man because at the end of
[77:31] the day that's how you find things and
[77:35] sometimes we stop because we have a
[77:38] perception of the thing because we think
[77:40] we know what it
[77:41] is one of the biggest mistake for
[77:44] example is to say oh I've gone on
[77:46] holiday over there that's a I don't like
[77:48] it well when you go on holiday it's very
[77:50] much different if you leave there it's
[77:52] like day and night there's places first
[77:55] time I went to London as a tourist I
[77:58] hated it I've been there 17 years
[78:00] amazing I love London living in London
[78:03] as a Londoner is not a tourist it's
[78:06] completely different thing the best you
[78:08] can do is probably build a backpack and
[78:11] take some time off you
[78:13] know that that would be one if I had a I
[78:15] don't have any any children but if I had
[78:17] a child I would make him or her do it
[78:20] like I before say you need to take a
[78:22] backpack and go for a year I don't want
[78:23] to see you here some money there's some
[78:26] Bitcoin just go and travel because that
[78:30] that will give
[78:31] you a lot of insight about there's many
[78:34] people they don't have not even nearly
[78:37] the problems we have they don't even
[78:39] have access to water for example they
[78:41] don't even access to fresh food you know
[78:43] there are places in the US where you
[78:45] cannot find greens and veggies and
[78:48] everything is
[78:49] microwave ready there is no there is no
[78:54] veggies there is no fruit there is just
[78:57] like boxes in plastic with lasagnas into
[79:00] it and I'm like what I mean where are
[79:02] the ingredients like this is supermarket
[79:04] and I'm like of course everyone is not
[79:08] healthy right and there's also places
[79:10] where they don't even comprehend the
[79:12] world fast food together like how can
[79:16] food be fast it's not possible like so
[79:20] all those things I think you you owe to
[79:22] yourself to explore them you know you
[79:24] know and then you can decide once you've
[79:26] seen them once you test them them out
[79:27] you can say well I consciously want to
[79:30] do this because I've done it but I
[79:33] guarantee you that if you try some basic
[79:35] stuff like and this could be very well
[79:38] this go all all goes back to bitcoin
[79:40] because you know it's the same thing
[79:41] what is money okay well you can try to
[79:43] own some dollars you can try to own some
[79:45] euros you can try to own some Bitcoin
[79:48] and if you truly experience what it
[79:49] means to own it well then it's a
[79:53] no-brainer it's
[79:55] if you truly understand why Bitcoin is
[79:58] needed and what problem is solving there
[80:00] is no scenario where someone is not
[80:03] going to get it I I I don't think it's
[80:07] impossible you have to get it after
[80:10] sometime I love the inss that you gave
[80:13] here um our end routine in the podcast
[80:15] is where the previous guest is asking a
[80:16] question for the next guest without
[80:18] knowing who the next guest actually is
[80:20] and your question from the previous
[80:22] guest is what are you doing to make the
[80:25] world a better place nice I love it by
[80:28] the way I cannot wait to give you mine
[80:31] uh I work on myself uh extensively
[80:33] because I think if you want to change
[80:36] the world you have to change who you are
[80:37] and then by reflection you will change
[80:40] everything this is something someone
[80:41] else has said so I'm not going to steal
[80:43] the quote but um I do believe that by
[80:45] working on yourself you're going to do a
[80:48] service to everybody else so even though
[80:50] it could be seen as a selfish act I
[80:52] think being selfish is actually the most
[80:54] beautiful thing you can do because if
[80:56] you are happy within who you are you are
[80:59] happy within Society whether if you are
[81:02] unhappy within who you are then you have
[81:04] a problem with everybody so work on
[81:06] yourself wonderful I I love it um
[81:10] perfect then before I let you go um
[81:12] where can people find you what can uh
[81:15] where can people reach out to you and
[81:16] ask you questions nice thank you so I
[81:18] have a podcast called mrm podcast and
[81:21] where I had a beautiful chat with you
