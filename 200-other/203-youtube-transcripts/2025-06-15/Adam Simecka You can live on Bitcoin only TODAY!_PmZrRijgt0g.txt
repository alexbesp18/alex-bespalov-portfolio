[00:00] everything on Earth will be valued
[00:01] against Bitcoin people saying oh this
[00:03] isn't going to happen for another
[00:04] hundred years I think is absolutely
[00:06] crazy because Bitcoin doesn't grow
[00:08] linearly Fiat doesn't die linearly it
[00:10] happens very suddenly the ability to use
[00:12] it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash
[00:14] system is the Crux of of what makes
[00:16] Bitcoin Bitcoin the most powerful people
[00:19] in my future are going to be bitcoiners
[00:20] Fiat currencies have a limited shelf
[00:22] life and most of the world is on a Fiat
[00:24] standard and because of that the
[00:26] bitcoiners are going to be the the best
[00:28] off and going to have the biggest start
[00:30] spending Bitcoin isn't only not bad but
[00:33] but that it's also good and it can be
[00:34] beneficial to you and to your Bitcoin
[00:38] economy to the Bitcoin Network you are
[00:40] choosing to be more poor than you need
[00:42] to be because the person that is
[00:43] converting their checking account their
[00:45] spending account and moving everything
[00:47] on that side over to a Bitcoin standard
[00:48] as well is actually going to end up
[00:50] richer than you because they're staying
[00:51] in Bitcoin longer and they have more
[00:53] exposure to bitcoin you could easily
[00:54] sell over six figures of Bitcoin every
[00:57] year live on that and pay $0 in tax to
[01:00] the
[01:03] IRS you said one interesting sentence
[01:06] where before we started um without the
[01:09] medium exchange sides like we we we
[01:11] probably will not have the store of
[01:13] value side uh which is um I think
[01:17] against that what uh cedine I think cine
[01:21] probably was one of the first that to
[01:22] said it maybe people before I said it
[01:24] also like store of value and then the
[01:26] med of exchange comes um why is med of
[01:29] Exchange in your eyes so so important
[01:31] for for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
[01:33] ecosystem uh at a core well there are a
[01:35] lot of small reasons but at the core the
[01:38] main reason is because uh Bitcoin
[01:41] without the um the value of being able
[01:45] to use it as a medium exchange and by
[01:47] that defining you can send it to anyone
[01:51] anywhere at any time um without that
[01:54] function of Bitcoin you don't have
[01:56] Bitcoin um and therefore in my eyes you
[02:00] know Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have
[02:01] any value because it's just another
[02:04] Financial instrument that gets buried in
[02:06] with the rest so um the ability to use
[02:09] it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash
[02:11] system is the Crux of of what makes
[02:14] Bitcoin Bitcoin and again that really
[02:17] comes down to being able to use it as a
[02:19] medium of exchange now I will say that
[02:21] there is some Nuance there you know
[02:23] being able to use it as a medium
[02:24] exchange on different scales you know
[02:27] there is a conversation to be had there
[02:29] where you know whether it's a large
[02:30] entity like a businesses to business
[02:32] type transaction or even nation state to
[02:35] nation state like that would be a huge
[02:36] scale I'm not necessarily saying that
[02:39] it's a prerequisite or a requirement for
[02:42] you know being able to buy your coffee
[02:43] on layer one um but you have to have
[02:45] some degree of the ability uh to
[02:48] transact in a peer-to-peer way without
[02:50] any third parties for Bitcoin to have
[02:52] any value at all and there are a lot of
[02:55] layers to it because like there's first
[02:57] like the technical layers that Bitcoin
[02:59] is just just technically so Advanced
[03:01] that we can buy a coffee with it maybe
[03:04] with Layer Two or layer three technology
[03:07] uh and then there's also the legal side
[03:09] to it because in Austria if I buy a
[03:11] coffee with Bitcoin I have to pay
[03:12] capital gains tax if the Bitcoin in in
[03:15] the meantime uh went up uh which it
[03:18] usually does um is is it like I think
[03:22] the technical side is is definitely
[03:24] required and it it will be developed
[03:26] it's it's just a matter of time till the
[03:28] tech is advanced enough but do we also
[03:31] need long term to for in order Bitcoin
[03:34] to be
[03:35] successful uh also the legal tender
[03:37] status no capital gains tax a free free
[03:40] transaction of Bitcoin no I don't I
[03:42] don't think that it's required at all um
[03:45] I think that given you know the current
[03:47] nature of of how the regulatory bodies
[03:50] view Bitcoin we have everything we need
[03:53] for Bitcoin to keep scaling now
[03:56] eventually I think that it will flip
[03:58] right because um Bitcoin is just this uh
[04:02] amazing technology for aligning
[04:04] incentives and you'll see you know the
[04:08] game theory play out uh across the world
[04:10] where countries nation states will do
[04:13] everything they can to attract people to
[04:16] come to their country to develop in
[04:18] their country and the most powerful
[04:20] people in my future are going to be
[04:23] bitcoiners because the you know the
[04:25] purchasing power and the the value
[04:27] itself of the the Bitcoin is only going
[04:29] to appreciate against all the Fiat
[04:31] that's you know going down um you know
[04:34] these Fiat currencies have a limited
[04:35] shelf life and most of the world is on a
[04:38] Fiat standard and because of that the
[04:41] bitcoiners um the people that have that
[04:43] live on a Bitcoin standard are going to
[04:45] be you know essentially the best off and
[04:48] G to have the biggest head start and
[04:50] these countries are going to be fighting
[04:52] over that so I don't think it's required
[04:54] again but I do think it is an inevitable
[04:57] outcome so you know we're going to have
[04:59] Ries that really priority really
[05:02] prioritize you know maybe things like
[05:05] Illegal Tender I'm personally not for
[05:07] legal tender laws as a whole just
[05:10] because it is um you know an imposition
[05:14] of the government basically forcing
[05:16] people to do something um I don't think
[05:19] that that's required with bit Bitcoin so
[05:21] you take the example of El Salvador um I
[05:24] think El Salvador is a good example
[05:25] because that's maybe an exception
[05:28] because it was the first um I think it's
[05:31] you know still probably too early at
[05:33] this phase uh this this uh point in time
[05:37] in order to you know if you're really
[05:40] wanting to make some radical changes
[05:41] like neab bu has done the president of
[05:44] El Salvador um legal tender was the
[05:47] fastest way to make that happen so you
[05:49] know if he would have done something
[05:51] like um uh like a free currency like
[05:54] what you're seeing in I think Argentina
[05:56] is is talking about doing something like
[05:58] this where they're just allowing
[06:00] currencies to compete with each other um
[06:02] and different forms of money but when
[06:06] you do something like that it's it's a
[06:07] lot slower of a process to roll out now
[06:10] again I think it's inevitable with
[06:11] Bitcoin but I can see both sides um
[06:14] where you have legal tender laws and you
[06:16] know maybe just some uh less regulation
[06:18] or you could say deregulation of the
[06:19] currency and I think it's important to
[06:21] to have a Bitcoin economy I mean uh I
[06:25] for example have um one of my sponsors
[06:29] pays me in Bitcoin uh only uh the other
[06:32] ones pay me in Fiat uh so I can have
[06:35] like I can pay my Fiat bills without
[06:37] selling Bitcoin which would be a lot of
[06:39] uh paperwork for me to do so I like to
[06:43] do it in that way um which is a cool
[06:45] thing where when you can split your like
[06:47] payments in feat and Bitcoin um but then
[06:50] also like sometimes a spend Bitcoin like
[06:52] spend Bitcoin on a Bitcoin Meetup or
[06:55] Bitcoin conferences so like that's like
[06:57] the the start of this circular economy
[07:00] uh where I didn't get the permission of
[07:02] the Austrian national state that like oh
[07:05] yeah you should use Bitcoin as legal
[07:07] tender but I still use it I pay other
[07:10] people with it and it's a it's a very
[07:13] satisfying feeling that there's like a
[07:15] private money uh that is open
[07:18] permissionless transparent and all that
[07:20] things uh and we can just use it and
[07:23] it's it's it's uh fing up that circular
[07:26] economy I think there's two sides of
[07:27] that and you just mentioned a lot of
[07:30] great reasons why using Bitcoin in a
[07:33] circular circular economy is beneficial
[07:36] um I think using Bitcoin like the
[07:39] Bitcoin economy meaning you know you've
[07:41] got people that are living on a Bitcoin
[07:42] standard maybe you've got people that
[07:44] are somewhere in between a Fiat standard
[07:46] and a Bitcoin standard which is a lot of
[07:48] you know us bitcoiners right now um and
[07:50] then on top of that you've got all this
[07:52] infrastructure you've got people
[07:54] accepting Bitcoin for payment or doing
[07:56] currency conversions um things like that
[08:00] are beneficial for Bitcoin because uh
[08:03] like you said it's you know it it's got
[08:05] all these all these benefits it's it's
[08:07] private uh it's uncensorable to you know
[08:09] to a degree depending on how you're
[08:11] using it if you're using it in in the
[08:13] way uh the white paper intends it to be
[08:16] you know there's nobody that can stop
[08:17] that you got to hold your own keys in
[08:18] order for that to happen um but there
[08:21] are seriously some some major so
[08:24] sovereignty benefits to using Bitcoin as
[08:26] your money and as your spending currency
[08:28] and I think that's
[08:29] really where um I'd like to focus a lot
[08:33] of this conversation is because a lot of
[08:35] people are for some weird reason against
[08:38] spending Bitcoin there are a lot of
[08:40] reasons you know that I found um I
[08:43] focused on this for a while um but a lot
[08:46] of people have this idea that spending
[08:48] Bitcoin is bad and my goal is to
[08:51] hopefully try to help convince people
[08:53] that spending Bitcoin isn't only not bad
[08:56] but it but that it's also good and it
[08:58] can be beneficial to you and to your
[09:02] Bitcoin economy to the Bitcoin network
[09:05] uh and you know everybody as a whole so
[09:08] my point there is spending
[09:11] Bitcoin is actually a lot easier and
[09:15] more beneficial than a lot of people
[09:16] realize now I will say there are some
[09:20] hurdles you mentioned one so paying
[09:22] capital gains taxes a lot of people have
[09:25] this idea that hey I don't want to spend
[09:27] my Bitcoin because that means one I'm
[09:29] going to have to track the taxes and two
[09:31] I'm going to have to pay them these are
[09:33] problems that are very trivial to solve
[09:36] I mean you can run some software pretty
[09:39] easily that can track your cost basis
[09:43] and at the end of the year when it comes
[09:44] time to pay your taxes you know you
[09:46] press one button you get a report you
[09:48] send that to your tax guy and you pay
[09:51] the taxes now that's the other part
[09:53] right some people are just adamantly
[09:54] opposed to uh paying taxes or even may
[09:59] maybe more specifically capital gains
[10:00] taxes but I want to kind of get into the
[10:03] breakdown there because I think there is
[10:06] um some uh I don't know cognitive
[10:10] dissonance perhaps in that mindset let
[10:13] me explain why in order to avoid paying
[10:16] capital gains taxes on
[10:18] bitcoin you have to spend Fiat which
[10:22] means you got to hold Fiat and so I'm
[10:25] not personally against holding any Fiat
[10:29] I hold Fiat you know to some degree but
[10:33] the argument that I want to try to make
[10:34] is that moving the majority or at least
[10:38] the more the more Fiat you can move into
[10:40] Bitcoin the more beneficial you will be
[10:43] so my point is it's okay to spend
[10:46] Bitcoin and have these capital gains
[10:48] taxes as long as it's beneficial to you
[10:50] in the long run in every way imaginable
[10:53] so you know one of the reasons that
[10:55] people have this is the the idealistic
[10:57] component of spending uh or paying the
[11:00] IRS for capital gains taxes are like I
[11:02] just don't want to pay that well that's
[11:04] like a that's a you know a financial
[11:08] perspective you know thinking like I'm
[11:09] going to be worse off financially
[11:11] because I'm going to do that well I can
[11:14] give you you know some pretty clear
[11:15] examples that would explain why that's
[11:17] not the case there's also the ideal
[11:19] component the idealistic component again
[11:21] like I mentioned they just don't want to
[11:22] pay pay the IRS at all um but again the
[11:26] solu their solution to that is by using
[11:28] Fiat I don't think that's a solution
[11:30] that's just using Central Bank
[11:32] currencies um which you know is is
[11:35] arguably no better than funding the IRS
[11:39] so here's my example if you've got you
[11:42] know two different people um one person
[11:45] is you know using uh Fiat for their
[11:49] let's just say like their checking or
[11:50] their spending account and another
[11:52] person is using
[11:54] Bitcoin now I probably don't have to
[11:56] convince a whole lot of people that
[11:59] having Bitcoin and savings is a good
[12:00] idea using Bitcoin as a store of value
[12:02] as we discussed that's a very easy topic
[12:05] to get across to a lot of people there's
[12:07] obviously some people in the world that
[12:09] are still not of the mindset that
[12:11] Bitcoin is a great store of value but
[12:13] that's a that's a separate subject I'm
[12:14] I'm specifically talking about you know
[12:16] bitcoiners people that hold Bitcoin and
[12:19] when I go through this let me just say
[12:22] what I'm about to outline and
[12:24] explain really doesn't pertain to
[12:26] anybody or it doesn't pertain to
[12:28] everybody so if you are somebody who
[12:31] does not believe that Bitcoin is going
[12:33] to appreciate and value against the US
[12:36] dollar or Fiat currencies in general
[12:39] then this probably isn't for you but I
[12:41] think the vast majority of people
[12:43] watching and listening to this are of
[12:45] the mindset that you know the Fiat value
[12:49] of of the currency that they're holding
[12:50] in Fiat is going to go down and Bitcoin
[12:53] is going to appreciate against that Fiat
[12:55] so that that's kind of who I'm talking
[12:56] to um the other way the only the other
[13:00] category of people that this wouldn't
[13:01] apply to is people that U believe they
[13:04] can time markets so if you think that
[13:06] you are smarter than the market and you
[13:07] can get in and out at exactly the right
[13:10] time um then this advice probably isn't
[13:13] for you um I have found out the hard way
[13:16] that I am not smarter than the market um
[13:19] I used to trade plenty and uh yeah that
[13:22] was a a humbling experience that turned
[13:24] me into uh you know a hardcore Bitcoin
[13:27] Maxi so here I am today um but let me
[13:31] give you this example so you got again
[13:32] these two people one person uh gets paid
[13:35] a Fiat paycheck let's just say both of
[13:37] these people get paid in Fiat it doesn't
[13:39] necessarily matter but just for the sake
[13:41] of following uh the example let's say
[13:43] that on day one uh the first day of the
[13:46] month you get a paycheck and it's $100
[13:48] let's say just keep math simple the
[13:51] first person keeps that $100 because
[13:53] they know they've got $100 worth of
[13:55] bills or things that they need to buy
[13:57] that month so they keep it in F
[13:59] because they're like oh I don't want to
[14:01] convert it to bitcoin and then worry
[14:02] about the capital gains and tracking
[14:04] taxes and and all that and I don't want
[14:06] to lose money so they keep it in Fiat at
[14:09] the end of the month um you know they've
[14:12] they've spent $100 and they have $ Zer
[14:15] left so they've they've gotten $100
[14:16] worth of goods and services and they've
[14:18] got nothing left over the other person
[14:20] on the other hand on day one they get
[14:22] their $100 paycheck they put it into
[14:24] Bitcoin right they buy Bitcoin they buy
[14:26] SATs with it at the current value of bit
[14:29] coin compared to Dollars that's about
[14:31] 170,000 SATs so again let's go back to
[14:35] day one so starting on day one person a
[14:38] has $100 in Fiat person B has 170,000
[14:42] SATs which is equivalent to about
[14:44] $100 let's say over the course of the
[14:47] month Bitcoin appreciates against the
[14:50] dollar to the tune of 10% so it goes
[14:53] from
[14:54] $59,000 which is kind of where we are
[14:56] today to $65,000 okay this is over the
[14:59] course of a month let's just assume that
[15:02] that is the effective uh increase for
[15:06] person B let's just say that they spent
[15:08] all their money at the very last day of
[15:10] the month and they got you know that
[15:12] whole 10% of capital gain so both people
[15:17] started with
[15:18] $100 person a at the end of the month
[15:22] has $100 worth of goods and services
[15:24] that they paid for person B has $100
[15:27] worth of goods and services that they
[15:28] paid for but they paid for it while or I
[15:31] guess I should say after they had
[15:33] converted their Fiat to bitcoin so at
[15:37] the end of the month person a has zero
[15:39] dollars zero SATs and zero capital gains
[15:44] tax liability person B has zero doar but
[15:49] now they have 15,000 SATs left over
[15:52] which is about $10 right so you've got a
[15:55] a 10% increase which is a 10% capital
[15:58] gain right so $10 $10 worth of uh
[16:03] Bitcoin at
[16:04] $65,000 is about 15,000 STS so again
[16:08] just so I don't lose anybody right now
[16:10] person a has nothing and no capital
[16:12] gains tax liability but they did get
[16:14] $100 worth of goods and services so did
[16:17] person B they got the $100 worth of
[16:19] goods and services they have $ Z on Fiat
[16:21] but they have 15,000 stats okay so now
[16:26] you're like you have to track all that
[16:28] of course so the the hard part is is
[16:30] doing that but again that's that's just
[16:32] a software thing you can there's plenty
[16:34] of software out there that will already
[16:35] do this for you um I'm
[16:38] building a Bitcoin wallet that will have
[16:41] you know this software built into it to
[16:42] make things easy um but there's there's
[16:44] a lot of options out there you can do
[16:46] this manually if you want obviously I
[16:48] don't really recommend that but the IRS
[16:51] is obviously going to come you know
[16:53] looking for their check too now what
[16:55] does that you know what does that look
[16:56] like well the average person's probably
[16:58] going to pay somewhere around 20% in
[17:01] capital gains uh for long-term Holdings
[17:04] and then somewhere around you know
[17:06] probably 15 to 25% let's just call it
[17:09] 20% for shortterm uh capital gains so
[17:13] depending on how you're spending your
[17:14] Bitcoin does change and affect this um
[17:17] again that's that's kind of probably
[17:19] something you would want to rely on
[17:20] software to track for you just because
[17:23] keeping track of you know which coins
[17:24] you're spending um you know may be a
[17:27] little bit difficult if you're doing it
[17:28] manually
[17:29] but again those are really the two
[17:31] scenarios either you're paying these
[17:32] capital gains from a long-term capital
[17:35] gain tax meaning you're holding the
[17:36] coins for over 12 months um or you're
[17:40] paying uh with shortterm which means
[17:41] you're just paying capital gains at the
[17:44] rate of your income tax okay and this
[17:47] applies to the United States okay if
[17:49] you're outside of the US I I don't know
[17:51] you know which laws do and don't apply
[17:53] this is specific to the US I'm not a tax
[17:55] professional uh this is just my
[17:57] interpretation of the tax tax law so
[17:59] make sure you uh consult your tax
[18:01] professional um but the IRS is going to
[18:04] look for you know let's just say
[18:06] 20% that is uh 30 SATs in this example
[18:12] so person B they remember they ended up
[18:15] with 15,000
[18:17] SATs now they have to pay the IRS 30
[18:21] SATs that's 20 cents right so person a
[18:26] has nothing except for for the you know
[18:29] the stuff they bought the stuff they
[18:30] needed you know food shelter their bills
[18:33] whatever person B paid for the same
[18:35] things but person B has Bitcoin left
[18:39] over yeah sure they've got to give you
[18:41] know they got to give that extortion cut
[18:43] to the IRS but that was 30 SATs out of
[18:46] 15,000 SATs that's that's
[18:49] 20% so uh person B ends up with
[18:54] 14,970
[18:56] SATs at the end of it now
[18:59] you might have you know the the the the
[19:02] the big argument here is wait a second
[19:06] you know this is if Bitcoin appreciates
[19:09] by 10% over that month like it's a very
[19:12] you know
[19:13] cherry-picked uh example fair enough but
[19:17] let's let's look at this if again this
[19:19] goes back to what I said earlier before
[19:21] I begin if you if you believe the
[19:24] Bitcoin price in in terms of its its uh
[19:28] conversion rate to to the dollar is
[19:29] going to appreciate against the dollar
[19:32] then over time this scenario actually
[19:35] happens more often than the opposite so
[19:38] yes you could have a month where you
[19:39] lose some money but over time and again
[19:43] let's just look back historically
[19:45] speaking Over a four-year period Bitcoin
[19:49] has only ever gone up in Fiat terms
[19:52] compared to where it was you know at any
[19:54] point4 years prior so if you if you just
[19:57] live on this strategy for 4 years as
[20:00] long as you're using the historical data
[20:03] to make your model then this is
[20:05] guaranteed to have you end up in a
[20:08] better position statistically speaking
[20:10] so that's my argument against people
[20:12] that don't want to spend Bitcoin because
[20:14] they don't want to pay capital gains
[20:15] taxes and here's here's what I have to
[20:17] say about that you are choosing to be
[20:20] more poor than you need to be because
[20:23] the person that is converting their
[20:25] checking account their spending account
[20:27] and moving everything on that side over
[20:29] to a Bitcoin standard as well is
[20:31] actually going to end up richer than you
[20:33] because they're staying in Bitcoin
[20:35] longer and they have more exposure to
[20:36] bitcoin that's a really interesting uh
[20:39] way to think about it um especially also
[20:42] like one I think I don't know how it's
[20:44] in America and 50% of my audience is in
[20:47] America so it's it's highly relevant uh
[20:49] I know in Austria it's like if you make
[20:52] CLE gains like if you make profits in
[20:54] one month and in the other month you
[20:55] make losses you can differentiate them
[20:58] and like only pay for actually what you
[21:00] made uh in in the end of the year and
[21:02] not like only only the profits are taxed
[21:07] and the losses are uh negated uh so even
[21:10] if it this if there's like a down month
[21:13] and you lose money then you can write
[21:15] that off of the profits that you paid
[21:18] the other month uh which which makes
[21:20] that model even better how I do it uh I
[21:24] I kind of use that um flexible credit
[21:27] system or Banks where they are like hey
[21:30] you have a checking account I saw like
[21:32] since five years there there
[21:33] consistently is coming money in uh and I
[21:37] just use that uh where I have like an um
[21:41] how is it called in English I have no
[21:43] clue but it's just like um credit on the
[21:47] go like you can just like take it uh
[21:49] when you need it even if you go in the
[21:50] minus it's it's not like um you have to
[21:53] make a contract for that and stuff like
[21:55] that so I can go I think up to 10 or
[21:57] 20,000 in
[21:59] into Los uh and it's really cool because
[22:02] I can spend my Bitcoin I can spend uh
[22:06] with my feed everything and I'm trying
[22:09] always to hit the zero if I'm like just
[22:12] like a few 50 Euros or like 100 EUR in
[22:15] the Plus in my bank account I'm uh going
[22:19] I'm taking them and throwing them in my
[22:21] Bitcoin wallet directly if I'm under
[22:24] under the zero I'm just like don't
[22:27] invest in Bitcoin as long as I'm back at
[22:30] the zero so I'm kind of using um the the
[22:34] credit system of the Fiat system uh
[22:37] there's also another group of people
[22:39] that might uh look into borrowing
[22:41] completely against the Bitcoin so like
[22:43] they're taking the Bitcoin and and
[22:45] wanting uh to borrow against it because
[22:47] my variance I have to pay interest rates
[22:49] like that's the argument against my
[22:51] thing because the interest trates on
[22:53] that are obviously higher uh because you
[22:56] don't have to post any leral uh you can
[23:00] use it for Consumer there's like no
[23:02] purpose behind that there's no
[23:03] negotiation that's just like the bank
[23:05] giving it to every customer uh with a
[23:08] different frame but uh basically
[23:10] everyone gets the same one but it's not
[23:12] a lot of money because I usually pay it
[23:14] off really quickly so it's like uh
[23:17] probably ends up being the same as the
[23:19] capital gain STX I don't know if it
[23:21] Compares like that but what do you think
[23:23] of using the credit system in the way
[23:26] that I use it or the credit system uh in
[23:29] the way other people might use it with
[23:30] borrowing against uh the Bitcoin great
[23:33] questions um let me make sure I
[23:36] understand your strategy so you are
[23:38] essentially taking all of your money
[23:41] your value that you're receiving you're
[23:43] putting it all into Bitcoin and then
[23:45] you're spending on credit and paying
[23:47] that off with Bitcoin as
[23:50] needed yeah basically like I I always
[23:53] keep it around zero so sometimes I'm
[23:56] like minus 500 sometimes plus 5 500 but
[23:59] I'm always trying to hit my bank account
[24:01] with around zero uh and if there's like
[24:04] a big check from a sponsor coming in I'm
[24:06] giving it to uh into Bitcoin then it
[24:10] might be again like it will was maybe a
[24:13] thousand EUR in the plus I'm giving that
[24:15] into Bitcoin then there's maybe next
[24:18] week I have to pay rent then I'm a
[24:20] thousand EUR in the minus I'm waiting
[24:22] till the next check that I'm back at
[24:24] zero again so I just Ed that flexible
[24:26] system so I'm always kind of 100% in
[24:29] Bitcoin sometimes
[24:32] 99.5%
[24:33] sometimes 0.5% so that's that's what I
[24:37] use uh and yeah the next thing is what I
[24:40] hear a lot of people talking like oh
[24:42] yeah like just went to my bank and gave
[24:44] them my proof that I have like one
[24:47] Bitcoin and I got like a few thousand
[24:50] Euros for that to to pay some bills so
[24:52] using the credit strategy is getting all
[24:56] of the benefits of what I just described
[24:59] um so you're you're still you still have
[25:01] all the maximum Bitcoin exposure um
[25:04] which is where the benefits of what I
[25:06] outlined come from the only uh
[25:09] difference is that you're exposing
[25:11] yourself to credit which can be a good
[25:13] or bad thing or neutral depending on how
[25:15] you want to look at it but it's just
[25:16] another layer so you know there is some
[25:18] degree of uh I guess maybe leverage or
[25:23] risk because you're spending uh on
[25:25] credit so you're essentially you're
[25:27] essentially entering into a financial
[25:29] contract alone with somebody that you
[25:31] have to pay back at a later date um that
[25:35] is fine that's kind of a separate
[25:36] subject but I think what you're asking
[25:38] is you know is that a good strategy to
[25:41] maximize your financial position I would
[25:44] say certainly absolutely so again what
[25:47] you're saying with the with the credit
[25:49] uh strategy where you put all of your uh
[25:51] spending on on like a credit card and
[25:54] then you pay off you know maybe the the
[25:56] minimum payment or even the you know the
[25:59] full amount if you paid off the full
[26:01] amount it would essentially be exactly
[26:02] what I just described um but you may
[26:05] have some additional fees from your
[26:06] credit card so there may be a little bit
[26:08] of fees in there as well um and you're
[26:11] still going to have the capital gain if
[26:13] you're paying paying that off with your
[26:15] Bitcoin so whether you're buying goods
[26:17] or services or selling the Bitcoin for
[26:20] dollars to pay for the goods and
[26:21] services in the United States in the
[26:24] eyes of the IRS that is all selling
[26:26] Bitcoin so you do have to account for
[26:27] that as a capital game
[26:29] now you brought something else up and
[26:31] that was you know taking a loan against
[26:34] your Bitcoin as
[26:36] collateral um this is a strategy that
[26:38] became popular um a few years ago I
[26:41] think Michael sailor started talking
[26:43] about it a lot and and using the analogy
[26:45] of taking collateral on other assets
[26:47] like real estate I think his primary
[26:49] example is like Manhattan real estate
[26:51] you know you don't sell the Real Estate
[26:53] in Manhattan you take a loan against it
[26:56] and for a business and when you're you
[26:58] know at scale a very large scale I think
[27:01] that makes sense I think it does get a
[27:02] little bit problematic to get these
[27:04] Bitcoin loans um at a smaller scale an
[27:07] individual scale and the reason is it's
[27:10] just it's really risky there's actually
[27:12] there's a lot of risk so you have the
[27:13] risk of liquidation so if you don't
[27:16] capitalize your loan well enough or
[27:19] collateralize your loan well enough your
[27:21] loan to value is not appropriately
[27:24] balanced what can happen is in a huge
[27:27] draw down you could lose all of your
[27:29] Bitcoin all of your collateral um
[27:32] obviously you can re- uh recatalog
[27:45] [Music]
[27:58] so it can definitely be dangerous from a
[28:00] um from a collateral perspective and a
[28:02] liquidation perspective but there's also
[28:04] a huge huge and let me reemphasize this
[28:08] huge amount of counterparty risk and I
[28:11] don't think this is something that a lot
[28:12] of people give enough credit to because
[28:16] you see all these businesses going out
[28:18] and offering these services and products
[28:19] for Bitcoin collateralized loans um but
[28:23] if they don't have all that properly on
[28:26] the backside then what they have to do
[28:29] is they have to take risk on themselves
[28:31] so let me give you a couple examples
[28:33] you've got blockfi so they were a big
[28:35] one um Celsius right these are two
[28:38] companies that went belly up why did
[28:40] they go belly up well if you really
[28:42] break it down they were offering Bitcoin
[28:44] collateralized loans at an APR that was
[28:47] too low I mean that's really what it all
[28:49] comes down to so they were like okay you
[28:51] come do a Bitcoin collateralized loan
[28:53] with us and we're only going to charge
[28:55] you one and a half or 2% or 0% or
[28:57] whatever these companies were doing it
[28:59] was super low how are they affording to
[29:01] do that well they have to go get that
[29:03] interest somewhere else um and so they
[29:07] were you know using their money and they
[29:10] were financializing it and investing it
[29:13] in companies like three ARS Capital
[29:16] which ended up flopping so they lost
[29:18] everything what they do is they take
[29:20] your money they
[29:28] to back them up and so when they fail
[29:30] you know they fail there's no one to
[29:31] bail them out and that's what happened a
[29:34] few years ago when all these companies
[29:36] went under um there was just a lot of
[29:39] contagion in in the Bitcoin Market
[29:41] because of all the leverage that was
[29:43] there so my point is Bitcoin
[29:46] collateralized loans can work if you
[29:48] know what you're doing and if you're
[29:49] working with a reputable company and the
[29:52] easiest way to tell if your Bitcoin
[29:55] collateralized loan is a healthy loan or
[29:57] not is you have to look at the interest
[29:59] rate if your interest rate is lower than
[30:01] the rate of
[30:03] inflation and let me Define the rate of
[30:05] inflation that rate of inflation is the
[30:08] cost of capital that your lender is
[30:10] having that your lender has to pay so if
[30:13] I go get a loan from company a and
[30:16] Company's a inflation rate is
[30:19] 15% then the the APR that I need to pay
[30:23] that company has to be over 15% or else
[30:26] they have to get that somewhere else and
[30:29] that's just going to be added risk so
[30:32] with that said whatever the number is of
[30:34] inflation for you whatever your your
[30:36] number is you know whatever your
[30:37] estimate is everybody's going to have a
[30:39] different number but again what is
[30:41] important is what is the interest rate
[30:42] or the inflation rate for the company
[30:45] that you're dealing with if they're
[30:46] paying a certain amount of uh a certain
[30:50] amount for for their inflation so if
[30:53] their Co operating costs are X you have
[30:57] to be over that
[30:58] for your APR for your financial product
[31:00] to be protected so that's a good way to
[31:03] know if you're getting scammed if you're
[31:05] interest rate is lower than the
[31:07] inflation rate it's probably a scam if
[31:10] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:12] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:14] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:17] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[31:20] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:23] personal recommendation for Hardware
[31:24] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[31:27] it's simple to set up it's also perfect

[32:20] how to be a secure sovereign individual
[32:24] in general and last but not least I have
[32:27] something complete completely new for
[32:28] you guys I partnered up with coin
[32:32] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[32:35] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[32:37] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[32:40] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[32:43] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[32:46] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[32:49] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[32:51] watch brand is Bitcoin only make sure to
[32:55] check out the link in the description
[32:57] for this and amazing coin vigilante time
[33:00] pieces those watches are amazing I love
[33:02] them so much it was really hard for me
[33:04] to pick the one that I want to have
[33:06] because there are a lot of great options
[33:08] I went with the new transparency Edition
[33:12] they're all limited so grab yours those
[33:15] will not be available for a long time
[33:17] but there will come new models and new
[33:19] amazing designs along the way I think
[33:22] it's always uh important to note um as
[33:26] as soon as there's Credit in
[33:28] involved uh you have to pay the credit
[33:31] somehow back uh and obviously if you are
[33:34] a big company uh as with Michael sailor
[33:38] and he does those strategies on a really
[33:40] high level that I don't even understand
[33:41] what he's do doing on on with those
[33:44] notes and stuff um then you can easily
[33:47] do that because you have predictable
[33:49] income coming in but life is not
[33:52] predictable and if you're just one
[33:54] person and you're like oh yeah I will
[33:56] have that uh in come over the next 10
[33:58] years and I have this big loan and I can
[34:00] uh take advantage of Bitcoin uh then you
[34:04] might be surprised if like I don't know
[34:06] in two years your income is not there
[34:07] anymore something happens in your life
[34:09] you need some somewhere else money so uh
[34:12] wherever there's credit involved and
[34:14] that's why I like this strategy a lot
[34:16] wherever there's credit involved uh you
[34:18] have to be careful uh and and and really
[34:22] see if if like oh yeah is is is that
[34:24] income really coming can I actually loan
[34:27] against my Bitcoin because you don't
[34:29] want to have just because you want to
[34:31] have the 5% more of of Leverage in
[34:34] Bitcoin uh maybe lose all the Bitcoin
[34:37] like that's a introducing a risk that is
[34:39] not necessary as Bitcoin is already very
[34:42] uh fast progressing and very um
[34:46] extremely good performing uh asset in in
[34:49] that sense so I think credit is is um
[34:52] should not be introduced if if not
[34:54] necessary I choose to do it like that
[34:56] because it's such a small amount like I
[34:59] it's literally uh always less than one
[35:02] month of spending uh I can really like I
[35:06] I can compensate for that and I'm very
[35:08] young so I have a very high risk
[35:10] tolerance otherwise I would not be 100%
[35:13] uh in in Bitcoin um and one conclusion
[35:16] of of of yours uh is that the price goes
[35:20] up I 100% agree to that like I think
[35:23] bitcoin price will go up long long term
[35:25] uh and I think probably like 99 % of of
[35:28] people listening and watching um will
[35:31] attest to that and and will also say
[35:33] like oh yeah we think also that the
[35:35] Bitcoin price will go up long term um
[35:38] and most people will probably even say
[35:40] like why measured in in US dollars
[35:42] because US Dollars like will will go go
[35:44] away do have a framework of of where we
[35:47] are at the adoption rate Al maybe with
[35:49] with like um now we are coming into more
[35:53] more medium exchange usage uh and then
[35:56] also how do you think of like how
[35:59] valuable uh a Bitcoin will be how
[36:02] valuable like 0.1 Bitcoin will be uh in
[36:05] the future measured in maybe the US
[36:07] dollar measured in like how many houses
[36:09] I can buy uh because I think that's
[36:11] really interesting uh those pricing
[36:13] models yeah so there's a couple things
[36:15] there um firstly I think you will start
[36:19] to see um well not just start to see but
[36:21] you'll continue to see adoption of
[36:25] Bitcoin as a medium of Exchange
[36:28] um for a couple reasons one I believe it
[36:31] is a superior medium of exchange um the
[36:36] network itself is more robust than the
[36:40] Fiat or Central political currency
[36:43] Payment Systems um but also you have you
[36:47] know the the experience of of of people
[36:50] as they give it a try as as they try it
[36:53] they realize it works they stick around
[36:56] why do you have all these people
[36:58] that have one foot in a Bitcoin standard
[37:00] and a Fiat standard world and they're
[37:02] able to see a lot of this um in real
[37:05] time why are all these people moving
[37:07] over to spending and prioritizing
[37:10] spending Bitcoin as a medium of exchange
[37:13] you know some examples are you know Jeff
[37:15] Booth he's got um a very strong opinion
[37:18] on it um and he believes very strongly
[37:21] in using Bitcoin as a medum exchange um
[37:24] I just recently shared a video of Nico
[37:27] from simply Bitcoin explaining um how he
[37:30] figured this out um and how important it
[37:33] is to move over to a Bitcoin standard um
[37:36] I recently shared a post from Corey
[37:38] clipston you know um and you've got uh
[37:42] Francis pulio with um bull Bitcoin all
[37:45] of these people uh see the importance of
[37:48] spending Bitcoin as a medium exchange
[37:51] why is that these are people that have
[37:53] one thing in common they have a lot of
[37:55] exposure of seeing both sides of this
[37:57] fence they've spent time on both sides
[37:59] and they can see which side is better so
[38:01] I think over time more and more people
[38:03] will figure that out and to the point of
[38:06] that Nico made in the video that I
[38:07] shared um recently he says you know this
[38:10] is this is a kind of a cycle thing right
[38:12] it takes four years to really be able to
[38:15] comfortably put yourself into this
[38:16] position but then it takes another four
[38:18] years to realize those benefits um you
[38:21] got to you got to kind of it takes four
[38:22] years to step off into this um this
[38:25] category where you're you're comfortable
[38:27] enough to actually give it a try and
[38:30] then the next four years is you trying
[38:32] it out and realizing that it's actually
[38:34] working and then you're actually better
[38:37] off because you did it so it is it is a
[38:39] a very long process and it takes time
[38:42] everybody's going to need to take baby
[38:43] steps but my recommendation is just go
[38:46] out there and try it I'm not saying you
[38:47] have to convert all of your savings and
[38:50] all of your spending over to bitcoin and
[38:52] be on a Bitcoin standard today but do it
[38:54] a little bit of a at a time and give it
[38:56] a try and and then after a little bit of
[38:58] time you're going to be like oh hey I'm
[39:00] better off financially because I tried
[39:03] it and then you're going to do it again
[39:05] and again and again and again and then
[39:06] eight years later you're going to
[39:07] realize wow I am a lot better off
[39:09] financially and I'm completely in a
[39:11] completely different financial position
[39:13] because of you know how much time I just
[39:15] spent in Bitcoin it's just numberg go up
[39:17] technology and to your question you know
[39:19] how do you value that do you value it in
[39:21] Fiat do you value it in purchasing power
[39:23] and homes um that's a really hard
[39:26] question to answer because everybody's
[39:28] got you know a different perspective on
[39:30] how they want to look at it now I
[39:33] recently have kind of come back to being
[39:36] okay with looking at it through lens of
[39:39] comparing it to the US dollar or Fiat in
[39:42] general and the reason why is because
[39:45] it's really a gauge of how well Bitcoin
[39:48] is killing Fiat right so fiat's got a
[39:52] lot of different rules and I think
[39:53] Bitcoin is filling a lot of those rules
[39:56] and I like to call at the Bitcoin
[39:58] scoreboard that's just the price like
[40:00] the the Fiat dollar price that the world
[40:02] sees right every time the world you know
[40:05] the no coiners everybody anytime they
[40:07] hear or uh hear about Bitcoin they're
[40:09] always looking at the price of you know
[40:12] the dollar price of Bitcoin that's just
[40:14] a scoreboard that shows how badly Fiat
[40:16] is losing right and every time they look
[40:18] at the scoreboard oh there goes another
[40:20] you know x amount of points to bitcoin
[40:22] and that scoreboard just keeps going in
[40:24] One Direction and everybody's realizing
[40:27] that Fiat is losing the game so um I'm
[40:30] okay with looking at it through that
[40:32] lens I think that that you know as you
[40:33] move over to a Bitcoin standard there
[40:35] will be a time where you have more of a
[40:38] unit of account perspective of Bitcoin
[40:41] I'm not I'm really not there yet
[40:43] admittedly like I can see both sides um
[40:46] and in the past it was really hard for
[40:48] me to see things through a unit of
[40:50] account perspective um but we live in a
[40:52] world where most of the people around us
[40:55] in the Modern Age
[40:57] interact with value in terms of dollars
[41:00] and I think until hyperinflation hits in
[41:03] any country I'm not saying it has to be
[41:05] in the US but until hyperinflation hits
[41:08] um it's really hard for you to just
[41:10] switch over once you get to the
[41:12] hyperinflation stage of a fiat currency
[41:14] you you look at countries like Venezuela
[41:17] Argentina um turkey all these countries
[41:20] when they experience hyperinflation they
[41:21] are forced to look at uh their unit of
[41:24] account differently and so it's really
[41:26] easy at that point to see Bitcoin from a
[41:29] unit of account perspective when you're
[41:30] comparing you know Bitcoin can buy this
[41:32] many houses um so I think it's going to
[41:35] take some time to get to that point but
[41:37] um I've been looking at um a couple
[41:40] different pricing models um that are
[41:42] very popular lately stock to flow has
[41:44] been around for a little while uh as
[41:46] well as the power law and it seems to be
[41:48] like there's you know kind of a you know
[41:50] a war online over the legitimacy of
[41:54] these models um and which one's better
[41:57] and it's it's almost like uh you know
[41:59] this Feud uh between people and their
[42:01] and their pricing models that they want
[42:03] to subscribe
[42:04] to I for a long time was quite opposed
[42:09] to these pricing models because they're
[42:12] not real right they're just it's just
[42:14] like an extrapolation of somebody's you
[42:16] know data on a chart that tries to
[42:19] predict the price over the last few days
[42:22] I think I've actually changed my mind
[42:23] and I messaged you about this and said I
[42:25] think that I might want to talk about
[42:26] this just because it's kind of
[42:30] contentious so to speak you know there's
[42:32] there's a lot of argument uh on this and
[42:36] I I I imagine there's going to be a lot
[42:37] of people that um are a little bit taken
[42:40] back from from me saying that that I'm
[42:42] uh now starting to subscribe to some of
[42:44] these pricing models um but let me let
[42:46] me do uh let me give myself a shot to
[42:49] try to explain why you've got the stock
[42:51] to flow and the power law model these
[42:53] are really like the two leading models
[42:55] that people like to use and reference
[42:56] when they're trying to project the
[42:58] future price of Bitcoin which seems
[42:59] crazy on the surface but I don't think
[43:02] it's actually as crazy now as I once did
[43:04] because if you think about it um the the
[43:07] price we'll just we'll call the price of
[43:09] Bitcoin being comparing Bitcoin to
[43:12] dollars so the price of Bitcoin um is
[43:15] essentially just dictated by two
[43:18] different ratios it's a ratio of ratios
[43:20] so you've got the ratio of supply and
[43:23] demand of
[43:24] Bitcoin and you've got the ratio of
[43:27] supply and demand of Fiat now the ratio
[43:30] of those two ratios is essentially what
[43:32] you end up with with the price now it
[43:34] looks like there's a bunch of variables
[43:36] there right so you've got the demand of
[43:39] Bitcoin which seems to be a variable
[43:41] that is really hard to calculate you've
[43:43] got the supply of Fiat where people make
[43:45] the argument that no one knows how many
[43:47] dollars are going to exist you've got
[43:49] the demand of Fiat which seems to be
[43:51] fairly hard to calculate as well but I
[43:55] just recently came to I had an epiphany
[43:57] and that is that I I don't I no longer
[44:00] see this equation as a bunch of
[44:02] variables when I look at this equation
[44:04] now I see
[44:06] coefficients because when you look at
[44:08] let's just start with the the Bitcoin
[44:10] side you've got the supply and demand of
[44:12] Bitcoin supply and demand the supply is
[44:16] known that's already a coefficient we
[44:18] already know what the supply is going to
[44:20] be today tomorrow 100 years from
[44:22] now now obviously circulating Supply is
[44:25] a different story but let's just look at
[44:27] the uh or uh let's just look at the
[44:29] total outstanding
[44:31] Supply um and then look at the demand of
[44:34] Bitcoin so let's th and this is what I
[44:36] think was so genius about Satoshi I I
[44:39] don't know if he I don't know if he knew
[44:41] this when he created bitcoin or
[44:45] discovered Bitcoin however you want to
[44:46] look at it um but it's playing out so
[44:50] perfectly it makes me wonder if if this
[44:52] had been something he thought about
[44:53] because nobody else really seems to be
[44:54] talking about this and that is how much
[44:57] the the having impacts the price I think
[45:00] that uh not enough people are are really
[45:03] focused on the fact that the having is
[45:06] really driving the price um and and and
[45:09] they're looking at it backwards where
[45:10] the you know the the having is just
[45:12] simply taking Supply out and then the
[45:15] market can you know it's a it's a it's
[45:17] in free markets we we got a free
[45:18] efficient market um you know we price
[45:21] that model in I don't think it's priced
[45:22] in I really don't and and and I'll
[45:24] explain why so um we're again we're just
[45:28] this is going to be kind of a long or a
[45:29] long explanation but we're looking at
[45:31] the Bitcoin side right now supply and
[45:32] demand Supply is known demand now we can
[45:36] kind of chart the demand of Bitcoin over
[45:38] time okay so uh demand may increase
[45:43] let's just look at a four-year period so
[45:44] demand may increase you know maybe 25
[45:47] basis points somewhere in that ballpark
[45:50] right which is kind of I think pretty uh
[45:53] historically uh applicable right so we
[45:57] probably maybe 25 basis points every
[45:58] four years I'm just kind of throwing out
[46:00] a number but here's the thing going back
[46:03] to the having on the supply side so when
[46:06] we have the having the supply gets cut
[46:09] in half that's 50% okay that's
[46:14] uh 5,000 basis points is that right yeah
[46:18] so 5,000 basis points compared to 25
[46:22] basis points now when you look at when
[46:25] you look at that you can see obviously
[46:27] how much more of an impact the having is
[46:30] going to have versus the change in
[46:31] demand so the Delta of demand is so
[46:34] insignificant that I think it can
[46:36] essentially be rounded down to nothing
[46:39] right you can essentially just ignore
[46:40] the Delta of the demand because compared
[46:43] to the change of Supply it's very
[46:46] insignificant right the supply is
[46:47] changing by
[46:50] 50% again let me just reemphasize that
[46:52] because it's a staggering difference
[46:54] where the denominator of the demand is
[46:56] only changing by 25 basis points you
[46:59] know give or take obviously you know
[47:01] Bitcoin demand tends to grow over time
[47:03] in my opinion Fiat demand tends to
[47:05] shrink over time and I'll get onto the
[47:06] Fiat side in a minute but so let's look
[47:09] at the let's finish up the the Bitcoin
[47:10] side of this ratio so you've got the
[47:13] supply which is fixed and the demand
[47:16] which I have um explained why I feel
[47:20] like it is essential it's essentially
[47:22] irrelevant so in other words you can
[47:24] consider that you know fixed as well so
[47:27] the supply is really what matters on the
[47:29] Bitcoin side and then demand is
[47:31] irrelevant that's what I'm saying and
[47:32] that's what that's the point I'm trying
[47:33] to make now let's move over to the Fiat
[47:35] side as I mentioned a lot of people will
[47:37] say that the um supply of Fiat is
[47:43] unknown which is true um but one thing
[47:46] that we can accurately predict in my
[47:48] opinion uh is the issuance of new
[47:53] dollars right in in the base money so we
[47:56] can actually probably pretty accurately
[47:58] predict how much we're going to print
[48:01] like quantitative easing so I estimate
[48:04] that we're probably going to print uh
[48:06] you know about10 trillion dollar over
[48:08] the next four years and I just got to
[48:11] that by the fact of the current you know
[48:13] the current trajectory that we're we're
[48:15] on I think we're printing uh a trillion
[48:17] dollars every 100 days right now I think
[48:19] if that's right so if we're printing a
[48:22] trillion dollars every 100 days uh or a
[48:25] trillion dollars every 100 days you know
[48:27] over four years that's you know about
[48:29] $10 trillion let's keep the math easy so
[48:32] we can pretty accurately predict the
[48:35] supply or at least the new Supply newly
[48:37] issued supply of Fiat of
[48:40] USD and then again going back to the
[48:44] demand of that part of the ratio you
[48:47] have uh you know pretty steady demand as
[48:50] well so yeah we may see you know parts
[48:53] of the world falling off of the dollar
[48:55] um but the demand is pretty steady again
[48:59] let's just say 25 basis points or you
[49:02] know or flat right so again I round that
[49:05] down to being insignificant as well so
[49:08] on the supply the numerator I see that
[49:12] as a coefficient now because I think I
[49:14] can accurately you know in my mind with
[49:16] a reasonable degree of certainty tell
[49:17] you how much we're going to print over
[49:19] the next four years it's $10
[49:21] trillion the denominator is
[49:24] statistically irrelevant because it
[49:25] doesn't change very much at all right no
[49:28] matter no matter what happens it's very
[49:31] unlikely that that's going to be you
[49:33] know an order of magnitude different
[49:35] than 25 basis points or let's just say
[49:37] flat right so we have a coefficient on
[49:41] this side where you've got the supply of
[49:42] Bitcoin the denominator I just argued I
[49:46] see as a coefficient as well on the
[49:48] other side of the equation the supply of
[49:50] Fiat
[49:51] coefficient and the denominator the
[49:54] demand of Fiat I see as a coefficient as
[49:57] well again statistically irrelevant so
[49:59] it's literally just uh an equation of
[50:02] coefficients which basically just means
[50:04] these models are right but really
[50:07] primarily on accident right the stock to
[50:09] flow is you know uh you know looks at
[50:13] obviously the stock of the asset to the
[50:15] flow of the asset I think it's right but
[50:19] only because it just so happens to be
[50:21] because the chart just happens to track
[50:24] things in terms of accounting for that
[50:26] having now if you look at the power law
[50:29] I think that's right too and again I
[50:32] think it's more right on accident than
[50:34] anything but the power law is just
[50:36] looking at the historical price of
[50:38] Bitcoin and then projecting forward off
[50:41] off of a logarithmic
[50:42] chart I think you know if you had to
[50:44] compare the two the power law makes the
[50:46] most sense to me because uh it's it's
[50:49] accounting for you know the historical
[50:51] price change in terms of dollars a
[50:54] little bit more uh closely and it's
[50:57] using the historical data to project uh
[51:00] out forward now I will say if you're
[51:02] looking at the last let's just say four
[51:04] years there's going to be a pretty big
[51:05] difference if you're just including the
[51:07] data since like the covid era because
[51:10] our money printing has changed so
[51:11] drastically um but here's the point I
[51:13] want to try to make about these pricing
[51:15] models and why I think there's you know
[51:17] some Merit to them the actual dollar
[51:20] number may not necessarily be super easy
[51:23] to predict but the shape of these charts
[51:27] whether you're looking at it on a linear
[51:28] scale or logarithmic scale I think the
[51:31] shape is going to be accurate No Matter
[51:32] What so there is some value to these
[51:35] charts I think but not super super
[51:37] valuable other than the fact that I
[51:39] think that there's going to be you know
[51:41] a fairly narrow band of where we're
[51:43] going to see the price and I don't think
[51:45] it's really going to deviate too far out
[51:46] of that that's interesting I mean the I
[51:49] think the the power LW is is an
[51:53] interesting one because then you can
[51:54] also even uh they have this band and
[51:57] even can say like oh we are like two
[51:59] months out of the Bitcoin price we are
[52:02] three months out like before after we
[52:05] should have so like even if if the price
[52:07] is going under it you can buy more I
[52:10] don't I don't believe in that like I I
[52:12] just like I just buy as much as I can uh
[52:16] because as you said before like uh if if
[52:18] you try to trade Bitcoin if you try to
[52:20] time the market you usually you normally
[52:24] uh get wrecked by it uh you might have
[52:27] luck but you can also go to the casino
[52:29] or play the lottery if you might have
[52:31] luck uh that's why we don't have uh
[52:34] that's not why Bitcoin is here there's
[52:37] also something else there's the other um
[52:40] pricing model that Michael sailor
[52:42] usually uses and also is the fundamental
[52:45] thing uh that he usually bases his
[52:48] things on um the one from Jesse Myers
[52:52] it's not really a price Model per se uh
[52:55] because he just looking at the What's
[52:57] the total net net asset uh right now and
[53:01] he puts it last year at 900 trillion so
[53:04] we might be well above that uh um at
[53:07] this point but uh let's just say it's
[53:10] it's not 100 trillion then the
[53:11] interesting question for me is always
[53:13] like how much of the total assets can
[53:16] Bitcoin actually um subsume like when we
[53:21] think like okay Bitcoin is money it's an
[53:24] an amazing store value it might be an
[53:26] amazing Med it is an amazing medium of
[53:28] exchange uh maybe it's even uh more than
[53:31] that when we have um uh things built on
[53:35] layer twos that also integrate with with
[53:37] Satoshi and and Bitcoin maybe we have
[53:39] done even more use cases um Jesse Meers
[53:43] better known I think as as crus on
[53:46] Twitter um he uses a very conservative
[53:50] uh estimate of 20% Which would lead us
[53:53] to like a 10 million uh uh dollar price
[53:57] Target in today tollar term so like if
[54:00] if there's inflation coming to that
[54:01] equation it gets way higher than that
[54:04] then there there's this camp where
[54:05] they're saying like Okay Bitcoin is
[54:07] money money is 50% of every transaction
[54:11] uh
[54:12] so it should be 50% like Bitcoin should
[54:14] capture 50% of everything then there are
[54:18] shout out to rosi he's a he was a fellow
[54:21] guest of mine on the podcast he thinks
[54:24] that um Bitcoin will capture 99% of all
[54:29] energy physical and financially uh we
[54:33] made a we made a podcast around that
[54:35] that was really interesting but it goes
[54:37] very far out in the future where we have
[54:39] mining around the Sun and stuff like
[54:41] that uh so like there's like camps from
[54:44] like 20% to
[54:46] 99% uh and I actually like I'm not
[54:49] settled like that's why I asked I think
[54:52] Gary kadona asked in a podcast just a
[54:55] few days ago what he things and I will
[54:57] continue to ask people and I will also
[55:00] ask you now uh what do you think if
[55:02] Bitcoin is successful uh as a store of
[55:05] value as a me of exchange as a unitive
[55:07] account no matter when this is like this
[55:09] could be out like 50 years could be out
[55:11] 500 years um because the timing is
[55:14] always hard to predict I feel like uh
[55:16] but if Bitcoin is successful how much of
[55:19] the total net assets uh could Bitcoin
[55:23] realistically consume well I I don't
[55:26] know I've never been asked that question
[55:27] so directly before I
[55:30] think personally Bitcoin as far as
[55:33] Financial assets eventually it will just
[55:36] be the money I think that Bitcoin will
[55:40] be uh the value component both or I
[55:44] guess I should say from a store value
[55:47] medium exchange and unitive account
[55:49] perspective of everything eventually now
[55:52] I don't know if that happens in our
[55:54] lifetimes um it's going to take you know
[55:56] some time I think the answer is yes I do
[55:59] believe uh you know you and I are fairly
[56:02] young I think that in our lifetimes we
[56:04] will see Bitcoin swallow all value and
[56:08] it's G it kind of goes back to the Cano
[56:09] San Holm uh idea of everything divided
[56:12] by 21 million um and I think that I I
[56:16] subscribe to that um so I think Bitcoin
[56:19] swallows everything eventually um in the
[56:22] next 10 years I don't know in the next
[56:24] 40 I do I do think so and and the reason
[56:27] for that is um adoption happens
[56:32] exponentially time is linear right so 40
[56:35] years is is is just a linear scale of
[56:37] time going out so the the closer we get
[56:40] to whatever moment that is of
[56:42] hyperbitcoinization
[56:44] the the the faster and more rapidly that
[56:48] approaches um and so again that's why I
[56:52] think that uh I think that it's going to
[56:53] happen in less than 40 years we're going
[56:55] to have this you know hyperbolization
[56:57] moment in less than 40 years because um
[57:00] of all these exponential factors um
[57:03] inflation you know quantitative easing
[57:05] you know the debt being able to keep up
[57:07] with our debt we're going to have to
[57:08] print money well we're going to have to
[57:11] be able to print fake money USD uh
[57:14] exponentially more and more every year
[57:16] we're going to have to print more than
[57:17] we did the year before just to keep just
[57:19] to surface our debt which is crazy um
[57:22] and so that's an exponential Factor you
[57:24] know the Fiat is going to exponential
[57:26] collapse Bitcoin adoption you know the
[57:29] amount of people that are using Bitcoin
[57:31] today compared to the amount of people
[57:32] that were using it yesterday it's
[57:35] exponential the amount of people that
[57:37] are using the lightning network is
[57:40] exponential the amount of people
[57:41] innovating and building on bitcoin is
[57:43] exponential the amount of people running
[57:46] nodes is exponential the hash rate of
[57:50] the amount of power being used to mine
[57:53] Bitcoin all over the world it's
[57:55] exponential
[57:56] and so you have all these exponential
[57:58] factors compounding on a linear time
[58:01] scale so that's why I think that people
[58:03] saying oh this isn't going to happen for
[58:05] another hundred years I think is
[58:06] absolutely crazy because Bitcoin doesn't
[58:09] grow linearly Fiat doesn't die linearly
[58:12] like it happens very suddenly and it
[58:15] it's kind of like Parker Lewis says and
[58:17] gradually than suddenly there's there's
[58:18] a moment in which everything
[58:21] just goes and I think his his mindset
[58:25] there is
[58:26] once uh I think I don't want to I don't
[58:30] want to mess up his his his his um uh
[58:34] perspective on that so I'm just going to
[58:36] leave it at that because I'm not an
[58:37] expert um but I would definitely suggest
[58:41] sorry no
[58:43] wor um where was I it happened to me
[58:47] also like I think already two times I
[58:50] had a time where I always set alarms for
[58:53] like certain times for like lunch break
[58:55] and stuff like that for my myself
[58:56] because I'm self-employed now I stopped
[58:58] that completely and I I forgot to turn
[59:01] off an alarm so like in the middle of an
[59:03] episode like really
[59:05] loud that's that that happens um yeah
[59:09] it's I think pricing models in general
[59:12] uh where where we were in the discussion
[59:15] right now it's it's it's really
[59:17] interesting to to look at uh where where
[59:20] we are going uh and you you kind of was
[59:23] in in the in the in the long answer
[59:26] uh to to discuss okay how much of the
[59:29] total net assets could Bitcoin
[59:31] potentially consume I mean it cannot be
[59:35] that's that's the only thing
[59:38] um when we think of like Bitcoin is
[59:41] infinity um I love the meme from cot I
[59:44] love I love that kind of thinking um but
[59:48] realistically for me it's
[59:50] like a house will still have some value
[59:53] like it will not be free so there will
[59:55] still be be value in in a company there
[59:59] will still be a value in a real estate
[60:01] so it will not be completely
[60:05] 100% uh but it could be 99% so like
[60:08] house prices and even other prices could
[60:12] uh could crash down a lot like from from
[60:15] from where they are here right now and
[60:17] those crazy high valuations maybe on
[60:19] even growth stocks and stuff like that
[60:20] highly speculative growth stock that
[60:22] might change in the future it's also an
[60:24] interesting discussion like what what
[60:26] Bitcoin will do to the whole uh
[60:28] Financial World building businesses
[60:30] venture capital and stuff like that um
[60:32] which I find extremely interesting to
[60:35] talk about uh but uh in in in that uh we
[60:39] are currently uh if if you have your
[60:41] thought again yeah um and I my point was
[60:45] that I think that everything on Earth
[60:48] will be valued against Bitcoin um there
[60:51] will be in my
[60:53] opinion uh much less need for other
[60:55] financial instruments
[60:56] um you'll still have them but Bitcoin
[60:58] will be the you know the denominating
[61:01] the denominating asset for every for
[61:04] which every other asset is compared so
[61:07] um everything else is going to be an
[61:09] opportunity cost to not holding the
[61:11] Bitcoin and so it will
[61:25] we have we have precedent all over the
[61:28] planet the United States and in a lot of
[61:31] advanced um you know what we would call
[61:33] First World countries you know this is
[61:35] it's kind of an anomaly most countries
[61:37] don't have appreciating real estate
[61:40] prices and so they don't put a ton of a
[61:43] ton of money into the real estate you
[61:45] know you buy a house it gets older it
[61:47] starts to fall apart it loses value but
[61:51] in some countries we've got it all
[61:53] backwards because our our you know our
[61:55] our our Fiat is so broken that we have
[61:58] to find other places to put our our
[62:00] money and so we buy real estate to try
[62:03] to preserve our value but we buy you
[62:05] know stocks and equities we buy bonds um
[62:08] we do all these things to financialized
[62:11] all these other assets and all that's
[62:14] eventually going to go away that's my
[62:15] point it's all going to go to bitcoin um
[62:18] the financial aspect of everything will
[62:21] diminish in perpetuity compared to
[62:23] bitcoin I want to if can change gears
[62:26] real quick there's there's there's kind
[62:28] of a subject I wanted to touch on um
[62:30] just hopping back to using Bitcoin as a
[62:33] medium of exchange there's one point
[62:35] that I that I want to make and I I I I
[62:37] failed to mention it earlier and that is
[62:40] that capital gains in the United States
[62:42] uh is is pretty unique because if you've
[62:45] got long-term capital gains that you're
[62:47] using and you don't have any other form
[62:49] of income you can actually pay zero to
[62:53] the IRS um so long as you stay below a
[62:56] certain threshold so for example if
[62:59] you're married filing jointly if you
[63:03] make less than
[63:19] $94,900 well let me let me rephrase that
[63:22] you can have 94,5
[63:27] of capital gains that you don't have to
[63:29] pay taxes on as long as you're married
[63:31] filing jointly so if you're married if
[63:33] you're single it's like half of that um
[63:35] but if you're married filing jointly you
[63:37] can sell as much Bitcoin as you need to
[63:41] up to 94,5 of gains so you know if your
[63:46] cost basis is zero you would of course
[63:48] be selling
[63:49] 94,5 but most people's cost basis is not
[63:52] zero which means you can actually sell a
[63:54] lot more than that like you could easily
[63:56] sell over six figures of Bitcoin every
[64:00] year live on that and pay zero doar in
[64:03] tax to the IRS which is really cool I
[64:05] mean that's not special to bitcoin
[64:06] that's just how long-term capital gains
[64:08] taxes
[64:09] work um and so that's like a really cool
[64:12] strategy that's what I plan on doing I'm
[64:14] going to retire I'm going to you know
[64:16] stop working and having an income so to
[64:19] speak um I'm going to not sell assets
[64:23] you know or I will sell assets but it's
[64:25] going to be long long-term capital gains
[64:27] assets so I'm going to live off of my
[64:29] assets which is you know primarily
[64:30] Bitcoin so I'll sell my Bitcoin for
[64:34] dollars to pay for what I need to and
[64:36] again you know I'm of the mindset where
[64:38] I like to encourage people to use
[64:40] Bitcoin to better their lives I'm not
[64:42] advocating for people to spend over
[64:44] their means that's not at all what I'm
[64:46] saying okay I don't want to be confused
[64:48] here and say oh you know Adam said I
[64:50] should go spend all my Bitcoin like no
[64:53] that's not at all that's not at all my
[64:54] point my point is you know live frugally
[64:57] live live within your means and use
[64:59] Bitcoin as a tool to better those means
[65:02] so don't spend any more than you already
[65:04] are already need to but use Bitcoin in
[65:07] such a way to where you're you're you're
[65:10] you're financing your your life the
[65:11] things that you need and you're spending
[65:13] your Bitcoin on the things that are more
[65:16] valuable to you than holding that
[65:17] Bitcoin in the moment so uh Jack MERS
[65:20] recently talked about this um and he
[65:23] brings up the point that Bitcoin in
[65:25] Bitcoin you know is an opportunity cost
[65:28] and you have to compare every every
[65:29] purchase that you make to the
[65:31] opportunity cost that you're losing in
[65:34] holding Bitcoin that same Bitcoin so in
[65:37] in any given moment like you know we
[65:39] need to
[65:40] eat we need shelter we need
[65:44] Transportation you know these are things
[65:45] that I think is is healthy to spend your
[65:48] Bitcoin on especially if you don't have
[65:50] any Fiat right I'm not saying hold a
[65:52] bunch of Fiat and then just use your
[65:54] Bitcoin that's not also not what I'm
[65:55] saying I'm saying if you want to move
[65:57] everything over to bitcoin it's okay to
[66:00] spend your Bitcoin on the things that
[66:01] you need to live because as you hold
[66:04] your Bitcoin as the price appreciates
[66:07] your purchasing power goes up and you're
[66:09] better off and I I demonstrated that
[66:10] earlier going back to the opportunity
[66:12] cost you know there's that's one of the
[66:14] main points of why people don't spend
[66:17] their Bitcoin there people are against
[66:19] Bitcoin because they believe that the
[66:21] opportunity cost is greater my my
[66:24] argument is the opportunity cost of not
[66:26] spending Bitcoin is actually greater
[66:28] because you're you have to hold Fiat in
[66:29] order to do that I wrote an article
[66:32] about a year and a half ago it's called
[66:35] Bitcoin is spending I wrote it on uh the
[66:37] belt of Truth substack which is uh
[66:39] produced by oric patillo and um I I
[66:43] cover really like the four major reasons
[66:46] why people are hesitant to spend Bitcoin
[66:48] just give you a real quick overview I
[66:51] have Gram's law I have cost which
[66:54] includes opportunity cost and also the
[66:56] the the real nominal cost as well code
[66:59] of conduct and
[67:00] taxes and what I found is that a very
[67:05] large number of people are not spending
[67:07] Bitcoin for some reason that they
[67:09] actually don't agree with and in the
[67:11] article if you're interested you can
[67:13] read it but um in the article I go
[67:15] through and kind of explain why none of
[67:17] these actually make sense if you
[67:18] actually walk them all the way through
[67:20] and so my it's it's an argumentative
[67:22] article I try to persuade um persuade
[67:25] the the reader to uh to look at things
[67:26] in a different light at the time I wrote
[67:28] the article I actually uh focused on
[67:31] spending Bitcoin in a way that
[67:33] eliminated capital gains taxes entirely
[67:35] so I advocated for What's called the
[67:36] currency swap method um a lot of people
[67:40] are are familiar with uh strike and how
[67:43] strike works and so I outlined how you
[67:45] can spend Fiat over the Bitcoin rails
[67:47] and and avoid capital gains taxes um but
[67:51] I've I've simp I've since changed my
[67:53] mind now I believe that it's okay to put
[67:56] everything into Bitcoin um move all of
[68:00] my Fiat savings into Bitcoin and move
[68:03] all my Fiat spending into Bitcoin um and
[68:07] that has has uh turned out to be a good
[68:09] a good choice for myself I I love that a
[68:12] lot because then you get the the full
[68:14] power of Bitcoin and you really you
[68:17] really use it as as as what you should
[68:20] have used it as as money I love that a
[68:22] lot really cool um also for retire and
[68:26] uh one point that like the the question
[68:28] that always comes up in people's mind um
[68:31] the average age of of my fer is around
[68:34] 45 years old so let's just use that age
[68:37] uh people kind of want to retire uh
[68:40] maybe at like 60 65 maybe the concept of
[68:45] retirement for me is also like uh you
[68:48] should retire as as early as possible if
[68:50] you consider retirement only doing what
[68:52] you love but let's take the the
[68:55] traditional approach where you are
[68:58] retiring from a normal job um is there a
[69:02] framework where you think of like okay
[69:04] that's that's at least that that many
[69:06] Bitcoin you should have to to retire
[69:08] because that's the question that always
[69:10] comes up a lot and I I see this as as I
[69:13] have a lot of data with like how many
[69:15] people are asking that question and then
[69:17] how many people wanting to get across
[69:19] that topic do you have something uh um
[69:22] to think about that yeah let me start by
[69:25] saying I don't know and I don't think
[69:27] anybody can tell you that they do know
[69:29] for a fact but I can guess um my
[69:32] framework is such I think if you take
[69:35] whatever your expenses are for a year
[69:38] all right um let's just say it it costs
[69:40] you $50,000 to live
[69:44] okay what I recommend doing is taking
[69:47] half or sorry let me let me back up I
[69:51] recommend doubling your cost of
[69:53] living so you let's say make $100,000 a
[69:56] year you spend $50,000 a year to live
[70:00] take the other 50 and put it into
[70:02] Bitcoin this is not specific Financial
[70:05] advice this is just my method and which
[70:07] you know I think is is applicable to
[70:09] myself and you know could pan out to
[70:11] work out for other people too I don't
[70:12] know but my point is live below your
[70:16] means and take just take the exact
[70:19] amount that it costs for you to live and
[70:21] put that into Bitcoin if you don't have
[70:23] the ability maybe you don't make
[70:24] $100,000 a year most people don't lower
[70:27] your cost of living right give up the
[70:30] Netflix Netflix subscription you know
[70:32] don't stop going out to eat just stop
[70:34] spending a bunch of extra money that you
[70:35] don't need suffer for the time being a
[70:38] little bit more in order to preserve the
[70:41] value for your future right so in order
[70:43] to save you've got to postpone that
[70:46] instant gratification you can have the
[70:48] gratification later it's going to it's
[70:50] going to exponentially comp pound uh for
[70:52] you um that's my belief so here's what I
[70:55] say take the amount that it costs for
[70:58] you to live double that okay that's the
[71:01] amount that you need to that that that's
[71:04] your income half of that goes to bitcoin
[71:06] half of that goes to your expenses do
[71:08] that for eight years I think at the end
[71:11] of that eight years you can do whatever
[71:12] you want with your life I love that
[71:14] model D with double also yeah really
[71:17] cool yeah at a minimum again I use the
[71:20] the example of of of your living
[71:22] expenses because um you know you're
[71:25] should be able to sustain at least that
[71:27] lifestyle or better for the next you
[71:30] know until you until you until you die
[71:32] probably forever because because
[71:34] bitcoin's never going to stop
[71:35] appreciating against Real Assets in the
[71:37] world yeah that that's another thing if
[71:39] you take Bitcoin as
[71:42] Retirement you are benefiting from
[71:45] everything else getting cheaper in
[71:47] Bitcoin so that's uh it's a it's a major
[71:50] thing really cool and we're already at
[71:52] uh well over one hour uh which means
[71:55] that this brings me to my end routine of
[71:57] the of the podcast the the first
[71:59] question is for you uh that every guest
[72:02] of mine gets what can we learn from you
[72:04] besides all the things that we already
[72:06] talked about well I have a passion for
[72:10] trying to convince people to use Bitcoin
[72:13] how I think they should do
[72:15] it I say that a little bit Tong tongue
[72:17] and cheek because Bitcoin is obviously
[72:20] uh whatever you make of it um and and
[72:23] for some people it's it's going to be
[72:24] different than others
[72:25] but um my my point is recently I've I've
[72:29] been trying to uh show people that it's
[72:32] okay to spend Bitcoin and actually can
[72:34] can benefit benefit you in the long run
[72:37] um to to use Bitcoin as as a medium of
[72:39] exchange as well as a unit of account so
[72:42] um that's kind of the mission that I'm
[72:43] on right now um I realize that the tools
[72:46] that exist aren't perfect I've come into
[72:48] my own set of struggles with with using
[72:51] Bitcoin as a as a payment mechanism uh
[72:54] trouble with the lightning Network um
[72:56] trouble with taxes um just you know
[72:59] having a good set of tools to use so
[73:02] I've decided to build my own and so
[73:04] recently I've set off sat set out on
[73:07] this um mission to build uh a product
[73:10] that that is going to help with some of
[73:12] those shortcomings of what currently
[73:13] exists so as I understand it right now
[73:16] it's really hard to find something that
[73:17] is self- custodial meaning you hold your
[73:19] own keys and doesn't come with a bunch
[73:21] of extra headaches like opening and
[73:23] managing lightning channels so so um I'm
[73:25] building Mana wallet for that purpose um
[73:28] so Mana is just a wallet that is going
[73:30] to be fully self self- custodial meaning
[73:33] you hold your own keys but also has a
[73:36] lot of automation uh both on uh like the
[73:39] channel management side so our average
[73:41] user is not going to even need to know
[73:43] what a channel is they just need to know
[73:45] you know I need this this amount of STS
[73:48] or even denominated in dollars I need $5
[73:50] worth of bitcoin um and they can receive
[73:52] that or send it as needed um and then
[73:55] it'll also have some automation on the
[73:56] tax side as well so it'll make taxes
[73:58] easier so essentially what we're trying
[73:59] to do is is eliminate all of the reasons
[74:01] why people don't want to spend Bitcoin
[74:03] and don't give them a good reason for
[74:05] not wanting to spend
[74:06] Bitcoin I I love that mission really
[74:09] cool um the last the the end the last
[74:12] end routine of our of our podcast is
[74:14] where the previous guest is asking a
[74:15] question for the next guest without
[74:16] knowing who the next guest actually is
[74:19] and your question from the previous
[74:21] guest I now remember it was actually
[74:23] directly Gary codone he has asked that
[74:25] question uh what does freedom mean to
[74:27] you what does freedom mean to me freedom
[74:30] to me is being able to say and do what
[74:35] you want without being subjected to
[74:38] somebody else yeah I think that's it's
[74:41] it's kind of actually goes to what he
[74:44] says like it's it's it's it's a little
[74:46] bit different but I think that's like
[74:48] the uh the the the definition I also
[74:50] subscribe to really cool thank you so
[74:52] much um Adam for for being on the the
[74:55] show before I let you go where can

[74:58] and and and yeah subscribe to your
[75:00] channels I'm on X Adam sea and if you
[75:04] want to follow uh the wallet that we're
[75:07] building it's Mana Bitcoin MN Bitcoin
