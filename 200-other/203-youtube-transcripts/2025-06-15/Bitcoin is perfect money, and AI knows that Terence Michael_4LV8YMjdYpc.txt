[00:00] AI is going to want to use Bitcoin for
[00:02] everything because with all the
[00:03] knowledge AI has which really is just
[00:06] scrubbing and crawling the internet and
[00:08] all data and all information so if
[00:09] that's in a sense a perfect human of
[00:11] having all this information what money
[00:13] would that system choose it's going to
[00:15] look at everything it's going to look at
[00:16] the history of scams and whatnot and
[00:18] it's going to choose if the internet
[00:20] just tomorrow said there's an internet
[00:22] token and it's and its price is going to
[00:24] reflect how valuable it is how many
[00:25] people are going to use the internet
[00:27] want the internet that's Bitcoin I am a
[00:29] maxi but I also feel like hey if you
[00:31] have the extra money and you want to go
[00:33] play with dogecoins fine just don't
[00:35] confuse the public into thinking that's
[00:37] the same as Bitcoin cuz those are
[00:38] companies Bitcoin is a protocol it's
[00:40] like completely different we've never
[00:42] had money everything has been an attempt
[00:44] a surrogate everything has been the best
[00:46] thing that we could find we found you
[00:47] know seashells rocks tobacco hides
[00:49] shells whatever and so now we finally
[00:51] have it we have proof of money you know
[00:53] aliens have bled wow we there's proof
[00:55] that there's actual money
[01:00] you said like you're known as as Mr
[01:02] Hollywood like why why is that I also
[01:04] saw it in your your
[01:06] bio well I mean I'm not Mr Hollywood but
[01:09] you know bit the Bitcoin space is so
[01:11] small right with less than 0.1% adoption
[01:14] um we all are sort of looking for
[01:17] different voices in different areas and
[01:19] like you you know have being in it and
[01:21] security and stuff like what's what's
[01:22] the Fiat world that you're in as you're
[01:24] crossing over into this beautiful bright
[01:26] orange world that we've all found um and
[01:29] so there aren't a lot of people from
[01:31] Hollywood and so people will view me as
[01:34] that guy even though I'm not Mr
[01:35] Hollywood but you know I've produced 20
[01:37] feature films I've made 30 TV shows um
[01:41] you know I've done a lot in Hollywood I
[01:43] have deep connections I've lived in Los
[01:44] Angeles my whole life and so I've I've
[01:47] concentrated on story I've concentrated
[01:50] on allegory and messaging you know and a
[01:52] lot of bitcoiners will come into the
[01:54] space they'll start to figure out what
[01:57] Bitcoin is to them they're not
[01:58] necessarily writers they're not
[02:00] copywriters they don't really know how
[02:02] to tell story and so they're saying the
[02:04] right things but they fumble through it
[02:06] and so new people like this doesn't make
[02:08] sense it's complicated you're talking
[02:10] about Merkel trees and nonis and like
[02:12] wait what you know and it's almost like
[02:15] trying to explain the internet to an
[02:16] alien right now like we don't need to go
[02:18] back to to what the internet tcpip
[02:22] really is because it's actually quite
[02:24] complicated we could just say hey it has
[02:26] democratized information it's
[02:29] decentralized access for the whole world
[02:31] anyone can access it anyone can share
[02:34] anyone can get videos photos you know
[02:36] all the things that we know about the
[02:38] the similarities between the internet
[02:39] and
[02:40] Bitcoin so we're at such an early point
[02:44] in Bitcoin that I think people are
[02:46] looking for better ways to to explain
[02:48] Bitcoin to tell stories of Bitcoin what
[02:51] is bitcoin what is it backed by what's
[02:53] the intrinsic value like why is it used
[02:55] by criminals and we can explain better
[02:57] with story than just hitting certain
[03:00] facts that uh I don't think resonate
[03:02] with people so um because of my
[03:05] background uh certain companies will
[03:07] reach out to me whether they're starting
[03:09] so I've been contacted by apps or like
[03:11] new wallet new wallet companies um or
[03:15] some people that have been putting out
[03:16] long form articles whether I physically
[03:19] edit it or they're just like is there a
[03:21] better way to say this and sometimes I'm
[03:23] just shaving syllables right like like a
[03:25] comedian like you ever go to a comedy
[03:27] store Robin or a comedy club and you
[03:29] hear the joke and you go and you tell
[03:31] your friend well you're telling them the
[03:32] same joke but it's like wait a minute it
[03:34] was a lot funnier at the club it just
[03:36] didn't come out right but it's literally
[03:38] the order of the words and where they
[03:40] put the punchline so I I just love
[03:43] geeking out over
[03:45] messaging amazing and this the viewers
[03:48] don't know before we recorded I talked
[03:51] about lightings to you and then now I
[03:52] feel stupid because yeah all of you you
[03:54] know that stuff about lighting and I
[03:56] explained it to you oh no it's all good
[03:58] I mean I don't have it here but yeah
[04:02] just it looks great do you have a do you
[04:05] have a a favorite Bitcoin movie or a a
[04:09] movie that is not about Bitcoin but uh
[04:12] bitcoiners love is is there like a
[04:13] favorite movie for
[04:15] you well I mean I like the ones that a
[04:18] lot of bitcoiners do like whether it's
[04:20] the big short or whether it's the Matrix
[04:23] or whether it's the TV series um Mr
[04:25] Robot because I think all of those spoke
[04:29] to to um the world that we've been
[04:32] living in where we didn't realize we've
[04:33] been in this Fiat world and so we have
[04:37] always been trying to solve problems
[04:38] whether it's health education Finance
[04:41] but we were never aware of the first
[04:44] principal problem up here with broken
[04:45] money like you just don't think you just
[04:47] think oh I need to hustle I need to make
[04:48] more money um and I can solve all these
[04:50] problems but we didn't realize we just
[04:52] were choosing the wrong form of money um
[04:55] and so that's what I like about the
[04:56] Matrix which teaches you to unplug open
[04:59] your eyes
[05:00] like there is a system and we can escape
[05:03] it or we have to hustle and play the
[05:05] broken games within the
[05:06] system um and The Big Short too helped
[05:10] people see that uh it's it's not equal
[05:13] rules for all of the players we're all
[05:15] coming in to play a game but they can
[05:17] put points on the board at a different
[05:19] rate and and in an easier way than we
[05:21] can so I like movies like that and
[05:24] that's actually one of my goals is to
[05:25] continue to intersect Hollywood and
[05:28] Bitcoin where we can tell stories about
[05:31] Bitcoin without it necessarily being
[05:33] directly about Bitcoin like there's
[05:34] enough people in our space making
[05:36] documentaries and short forms and they
[05:38] keep coming out all over and those
[05:39] things are great but we need something
[05:41] that speak to the stock Bros and all the
[05:43] real estate guys and you know everyone
[05:45] chasing gamestock in AMC um they need
[05:49] something that speaks to that's kind of
[05:50] what I liked about dumb money I don't
[05:52] know if you saw dumb money which was the
[05:53] gamestock movie but in a weird way it
[05:56] was a lot of it was very similar to
[05:58] bitcoin they were literally even
[05:59] stealing memes like they used hoddle you
[06:01] know and things like that so um it's not
[06:05] an easy task because Hollywood doesn't
[06:08] directly want to talk about Bitcoin
[06:10] right now especially after all the
[06:11] centralized Finance scams of FTX and
[06:14] Celsius and you know some celebrities
[06:16] like Tom Brady and other sports people
[06:18] got caught up in that so um and they
[06:20] still can flight the two they can flight
[06:22] crypto and Bitcoin so um it's going to
[06:24] be a slow process but we'll get there do
[06:27] you you said you also out about
[06:30] messaging do do you think the overall
[06:32] messaging of of bitcoiners and and and
[06:35] Bitcoin sometimes is a little bit too
[06:37] toxic and it should be a little bit uh
[06:40] more more smooth and more
[06:42] loving sometimes it is yeah sometimes I
[06:44] feel like you know some Bitcoin owners
[06:47] can get too judgmental and can get very
[06:50] toxic I get where it's coming from right
[06:52] like we have finally found the perfect
[06:55] money right we've engineered a perfect
[06:57] money finally for the first time in
[06:59] history and that's why I named my book
[07:01] Proof of money my thesis is that we've
[07:03] never had money everything has been an
[07:05] attempt a surrogate everything has been
[07:07] the best thing that we could find we
[07:08] found you know seashells rocks tobacco
[07:11] hides shells whatever and so now we
[07:14] finally have it we have proof of money
[07:16] you know aliens have landed and wow we
[07:18] there's proof that there's actual money
[07:20] and so I get why people get toxic
[07:22] because they don't want people to get
[07:23] distracted like that's not money but you
[07:26] know I also don't yell at people that go
[07:28] to Vegas and people that want to play
[07:30] poker it's like as as long as they know
[07:32] that they're gambling and as long as
[07:34] they know do not put your generational
[07:36] wealth in this do not put your IRAs and
[07:38] your retirement in this then you know I
[07:41] think people can do what they want um I
[07:42] mean I am a maxi but I also feel like
[07:45] hey if you have the extra money and you
[07:47] want to go play with dogecoins fine just
[07:49] don't confuse the public into thinking
[07:51] that's the same as Bitcoin because those
[07:53] are companies Bitcoin is a protocol it's
[07:56] like completely different so that I
[08:00] think that's what a lot of um altcoins
[08:03] or shitcoins as I also like to call them
[08:06] are doing they like uh they presenting
[08:09] themsel as this new uh decentralized
[08:12] protocol that improves on that and that
[08:15] thing uh onto Bitcoin like they always
[08:17] like go like oh Bitcoin is great but
[08:20] here is why my altcoin is even better
[08:23] and this is that thing they improve on
[08:25] but what you're not saying is like in
[08:28] order to improve that one small thing
[08:30] they have to screw up a whole another
[08:31] really big thing that's really good that
[08:33] is in
[08:34] Bitcoin and it's like sometimes they
[08:37] they're having a really good messaging
[08:39] like I feel like the the crypto
[08:41] community over the Bitcoin Community
[08:43] sometimes has like really good marketing
[08:45] uh and really good wordings of it h and
[08:48] I feel like we we could even like steal
[08:50] something from
[08:52] them yeah absolutely and you know the
[08:55] and again it's just understanding the
[08:56] difference between a company and a
[08:57] protocol because you know they're not
[08:59] wrong like maybe xrp can move the xrp
[09:03] token on xrp's blockchain way faster
[09:08] than Bitcoin can at the Bas layer but
[09:10] that's not moving money just because
[09:12] that token moves around faster and can
[09:14] transact faster if that's even true I
[09:17] haven't looked into it well but that but
[09:19] that but that's not moving around money
[09:20] you're moving around a token that they
[09:22] can make as many of that they could stop
[09:24] that they could reverse and that yes
[09:26] might have good messaging because the
[09:29] well funded because they've printed
[09:30] their own tokens and they're a company
[09:33] like Bitcoin is not a company it's like
[09:34] we're all talking about the internet or
[09:36] the circle or gravity or the laws of
[09:39] Chess and it's like well you know
[09:41] everyone's going to explain that a
[09:42] little bit
[09:43] differently what didn't what they didn't
[09:45] inspire you to to write the the book
[09:47] Proof of money that you mentioned
[09:50] first what inspired me in a nutshell is
[09:52] that um I got into Hollywood very early
[09:56] immediately and I started making movies
[09:57] right away um and and I was fortunate
[10:01] enough to be at the right place at the
[10:02] right time that I made a lot of money
[10:04] really fast and really young and without
[10:07] knowing about Bitcoin or you know
[10:10] economics or or paying attention to it I
[10:12] just thought how do I hang on to this
[10:14] money because I got burned out really
[10:16] fast I didn't just want to keep doing
[10:18] that so I turned to real estate real
[10:20] estate seemed like the best thing and
[10:22] we've all been taught oh they're not
[10:23] making more of real estate it's scarce
[10:25] they're not making more land blah blah
[10:27] blah and so I I jumped in to real estate
[10:30] but I also couldn't afford to just buy
[10:32] homes even with the money I had so I was
[10:34] I had to learn to fix them up and so I
[10:36] learned a lot about real estate I got a
[10:37] broker's license I started a mortgage uh
[10:39] company I started a flipping company I
[10:41] started an Airbnb company um I had over
[10:44] 20 homes and I did really well it
[10:48] secured my wealth on from Hollywood Fiat
[10:52] but then I started realizing well wait a
[10:54] minute now I'm like this full-time
[10:56] landlord and getting these calls in the
[10:58] middle of the night and I don't want to
[11:00] deal with toilets and trash and tenants
[11:02] and taxes and that's what real estate
[11:04] was to me so it opened my eyes when I
[11:07] started to hear about Bitcoin and just
[11:10] like all of us I thought it was a scan
[11:12] like where is it I can't touch it this
[11:13] is
[11:14] bizarre but once you learn about it and
[11:16] you realize oh it is you can touch it it
[11:19] it's just that it's the digital version
[11:20] It's natively digital and I said okay
[11:22] this is the thing and we are in a
[11:24] digital world I realized I don't have to
[11:28] waste my time and energy on real estate
[11:31] which I am not as passionate about as I
[11:34] was Hollywood like I just had to use
[11:36] real estate to preserve Hollywood I
[11:38] would rather just go back to Hollywood
[11:40] but now I can use Bitcoin to preserve my
[11:42] money and concentrate on what I want to
[11:45] which can be Hollywood or can be
[11:46] anything else because it's preserving my
[11:49] purchasing power and my spending ability
[11:51] in the future I can concentrate on my
[11:53] talents and my experience and all the
[11:55] sacrifices I made in the past I can
[11:58] carry all those prefer refences forward
[12:00] in time because I'm not stuck you know
[12:03] at a house with my you know head under
[12:05] the basement trying to figure out the
[12:06] plumbing
[12:08] so that's why I wrote the book I said
[12:10] wait a minute we now have perfect money
[12:13] and all the things that we bitcoiners
[12:14] know with all the characteristics and
[12:15] all the properties that make perfect
[12:17] money and it's like here it is it's
[12:19] finally here even though we've gotten
[12:21] close with things like gold or the prior
[12:23] to that to the yapstone from the yapes
[12:26] island it's like this is it and I and I
[12:29] just wanted my people to know and the
[12:31] people that I were writing to were
[12:32] Hollywood people real estate people
[12:34] stock people people with major Fiat
[12:36] Minds people that were doing well with
[12:38] Fiat so they don't get it people you
[12:41] know I have friends that still do so
[12:43] well in Fiat that they'll never
[12:45] understand Bitcoin because it they don't
[12:46] need it it doesn't help them they don't
[12:49] think it helps them they don't realize
[12:50] they need it yet right like Michael
[12:51] sailor says uh some of these people
[12:53] don't realize they need to be our friend
[12:56] yet yeah he he made all of the 21 Rules
[12:59] uh and one of them was
[13:01] uh something if they don't need to know
[13:04] uh like if if if you don't need to know
[13:07] about Bitcoin you don't know about
[13:08] Bitcoin I forgot the rule what it was
[13:10] exactly but the conent was like if if
[13:12] you if you're not in the if you're not
[13:15] in a need to know about Bitcoin right
[13:17] now uh you don't have the emergency to
[13:21] like oh let's really investigate about
[13:24] uh Bitcoin right now and he described it
[13:26] with like his 2020 then he was kind of
[13:28] forced with his m ask cuber knowledge
[13:30] like oh now he has to know about like
[13:33] get about that uh so that's that's
[13:36] really cool and also like I I I had a
[13:38] similar experience what you describe
[13:40] because I was in the stock world before
[13:42] Bitcoin I was really u in the stocks
[13:44] even had like small German YouTube
[13:46] channel about stocks uh before I had
[13:48] that one which most are not aware of uh
[13:51] but uh it was really interesting because
[13:53] I became the stock guy and all those uh
[13:56] aunts and and uncles and cousins were
[13:58] coming com up to me like oh how do you
[14:00] do it because I I've do done actually
[14:03] quite well in stocks uh and then they
[14:05] come up to me and uh I tried to actually
[14:08] learn them how to pick stocks and how to
[14:10] get the get a nice portfolio and and
[14:13] what's how Diversified you have to be in
[14:15] stuff like that and I was like uh and I
[14:17] I struggled ex extremely with that uh
[14:20] because they didn't wanted to pick
[14:22] stocks they didn't wanted to like uh
[14:24] make a nice Diversified portfolio with
[14:27] like 10 companies in there uh with a
[14:30] different allocations and what I learned
[14:32] then with Bitcoin after I learned about
[14:34] Bitcoin I like they didn't wanted me to
[14:36] learn them how to pick stocks they
[14:38] wanted me to learn them how to save
[14:41] their financial energy and that's what
[14:43] Bitcoin is you just like adopt the
[14:45] Bitcoin standard and then you can go
[14:47] ahead and concentrate on your feia job
[14:49] and on your normal job just like I don't
[14:51] know as your doctor saving lives
[14:53] whatever you're doing that's the beauty
[14:56] of it like you you actually have all
[14:59] have money all of the
[15:00] sudden that's right yeah you shouldn't
[15:02] have to have a whole second job as an
[15:05] accountant or a broker or whatever just
[15:07] to preserve your first job 100% And as a
[15:10] as a as a doctor that earns well if you
[15:13] if we stay at that example um you have
[15:16] to have like if if you don't have
[15:17] Bitcoin and you only have US Dollars
[15:20] like you have to work a lot and you have
[15:22] a lot of responsibilities and you get
[15:24] paid good and and and that's okay like
[15:27] that but your money just like dissolves
[15:30] itself and then you have to work the
[15:32] whole time and you have to then depend
[15:34] on like a pension that you get from from
[15:36] your government or maybe also not it's
[15:39] even there when you need it yeah but
[15:42] yeah let's let's go back to to the book
[15:44] a little bit um what are the the core
[15:48] principles I'm always fascinated with
[15:49] Bitcoin books uh because they they are
[15:52] so many out there and they have so many
[15:55] unique perspectives on how to describe a
[15:59] Bitcoin and how to like get the point of
[16:01] Bitcoin across like there are a lot of
[16:03] different angles on that what what are
[16:05] you focusing on uh you also like said
[16:08] already a little bit with Hollywood and
[16:10] real estate and and stuff like that what
[16:12] are the core principl principles that
[16:14] you try to
[16:16] describe well many of the core
[16:17] principles I mean telling someone like
[16:19] you will feel redundant it's it's um a
[16:22] lot of the principles that some of the
[16:24] other books have it's just the way I do
[16:27] it um for instance
[16:29] um when I explain what nodes are and
[16:34] what mining is like how how we even get
[16:36] Bitcoin where does it come from and how
[16:37] do we even know it's scarce um I go
[16:40] through a three chapter Arc where I take
[16:43] the characters from the TV show Friends
[16:46] if you remember the TV show Friends um I
[16:49] take them they're in a coffee shop they
[16:50] meet this guy named Satoshi they don't
[16:53] like their Bank fees so I I create this
[16:56] story where they join and they go
[16:59] through all of the steps of learning how
[17:01] to decentralize the money who's going
[17:04] you know Phoebe is sending money to Ross
[17:06] how do I know it was her so we learn
[17:08] about secret Keys private Keys the words
[17:11] Joey's trying to memorize his words but
[17:13] he wrote them down in the wrong place
[17:15] and Ross is using his pet monkey to you
[17:18] know try to win the the the mining the
[17:20] block rewards and so it s as silly as it
[17:23] sounds when I lay it out in three
[17:25] chapters by the time you get to the end
[17:26] you're like wow I understand how miners
[17:29] interact with nodes interact with users
[17:32] I see how I can hold my Bitcoin but how
[17:35] everyone has a copy of The Ledger and
[17:36] how they all have to agree um and the
[17:40] reason I did that partly you know
[17:42] oftentimes when you write you write just
[17:43] to synthesize your own thoughts it's
[17:45] it's a very it's a selfish um practice
[17:48] it's for yourself and so I wanted to
[17:49] write that to prove to myself where my
[17:52] weaknesses were in understanding that
[17:55] because that was the part of Bitcoin
[17:56] that I um didn't understand as much
[17:59] the other chapters you know briefly
[18:02] there's you know history of money how we
[18:04] got to where we are there's the Fiat
[18:05] system right there's 1971 and then
[18:08] there's chapters where I compare it to
[18:09] Gold chapters where I compare it to the
[18:11] internet and then other chapters where I
[18:13] just go through through allegories and
[18:15] stories um explaining what inflation is
[18:19] but without the economics um uh without
[18:24] the economics and finance aspect because
[18:27] inflation gets lost on a lot of people
[18:28] people right so so here's an example
[18:30] Robin um I'll explain inflation first at
[18:33] a basic level in the book where I say so
[18:36] look our economy is 10 slices of
[18:40] pizza that's represents all our goods
[18:42] and services you Robin you want to have
[18:45] a swimming pool built at your house and
[18:47] I'm a swimming pool builder so I say to
[18:50] you okay Robin that's going to that's
[18:52] going to cost uh one slice of pizza
[18:54] right maybe you own two slices of pizza
[18:56] in this 10 slice economy right so very
[18:59] wealthy you you own two of 10 you own
[19:01] 20% of the whole network well I say hey
[19:04] I need one slice to build your pool okay
[19:07] so we have an agreement I want one slice
[19:09] I want the amount of calories the amount
[19:11] of cheese pepperoni on that one slice of
[19:13] the 10 slice thing that I know will pay
[19:15] for my workers my time will feed my
[19:18] family after I'm done building your pool
[19:20] the economy comes in the government
[19:22] comes in and reces the pizza so they are
[19:26] not adding any new calories no new
[19:29] quantity no new Goods no new Services
[19:30] when they inflate they inflate the money
[19:33] but inflating the money is just changing
[19:35] the number so this 10 slic Pizza it's
[19:37] the same Pizza the 10 slice they've now
[19:39] resliced it now there's 20 so now I come
[19:42] to you Robin and I say hey remember you
[19:45] said you were going to give me one slice
[19:47] and I'm going to build the pool well it
[19:49] just got cut in half I now need two
[19:52] slices now see as a swimming pool owner
[19:55] I don't want to charge more I just need
[19:57] the same amount of Goods I need the same
[20:00] value that we had agreed on originally I
[20:03] I know how many calories that is to feed
[20:05] my family and my workers to to build the
[20:08] pool so it's just a different way of
[20:10] explaining inflation but what it really
[20:12] is because everyone thinks oh well more
[20:14] money sounds good you're just throwing
[20:15] more money in they're just changing the
[20:17] number they're just upping the number
[20:19] there there's there's no new money
[20:21] because there's no new goods and
[20:23] services to correlate to it right it's
[20:25] the same amount um and I'll do the
[20:28] things where like to explain Bitcoin
[20:31] scarcity so you know some bitcoiners
[20:33] will hate me for saying this because I
[20:34] know this isn't 100% accurate but you
[20:36] know I used to get this all the time how
[20:38] do I know there's only 21 million
[20:39] Bitcoin how do I know more Bitcoin won't
[20:42] get made it's like well yes you can say
[20:44] look it's in the code and as a network
[20:46] we're all going to enforce the code we
[20:48] are we're all incentivized you Robin and
[20:50] and me we're all incentivized to keep it
[20:52] to 21 million we we we get the value in
[20:55] scarcity but I'll say so this is in so
[20:58] this is a little different maybe um but
[21:01] think of think of it this way to explain
[21:03] so Satoshi already released all 21
[21:06] million Bitcoin on day one all that he
[21:09] put it all there it's one big brick wall
[21:12] there's 21 million bricks and they're
[21:14] all cemented on this big wall like a
[21:16] piece of art that that we can see but
[21:19] there's this big curtain over like you
[21:21] you know how people lift up a curtain
[21:22] hey look at my art you know he started
[21:25] lifing it up very fast but every having
[21:27] every four years it slowed down in half
[21:29] right and we're seeing so like right now
[21:30] we can see 97 million of these 21
[21:33] million bricks but they're cemented we
[21:36] can't move it we can't take it no one
[21:38] else can can add anymore and once it
[21:40] gets to the top that's it it's over with
[21:43] so when we have a Bitcoin when we have
[21:46] our key our key is telling us where on
[21:49] that brick wall it's there you know when
[21:52] people talk about there being you know 4
[21:53] million plus Bitcoins that are lost it's
[21:55] like well it's not lost it's still there
[21:57] it's always going to be either we can
[21:59] see it right on the time chain or in
[22:01] this in this um story we can see it on
[22:03] the brick wall but if someone's lost
[22:05] their key they can't they can't access
[22:07] it and give their key they don't know
[22:08] where it is on this massive 21 million
[22:11] brick
[22:13] wall um so I'll use little um things
[22:16] like that just to explain and then I'll
[22:17] and then in my book I do accurately say
[22:20] how we know but I think some of that
[22:22] helps just the same thing with the
[22:23] allegory of the internet you know people
[22:25] try to use gold and call it digital gold
[22:28] or um other things like that to me
[22:30] there's no better metaphor hands down
[22:33] the best metaphor for Bitcoin is the
[22:35] internet just period because the
[22:37] internet is a network and we all benefit
[22:41] like where is the internet I can't touch
[22:42] it what what's the intrinsic value well
[22:45] I don't know the Valu is that we get to
[22:46] exchange information I can see things on
[22:49] it I I can access I can talk to someone
[22:51] else other side of the country well
[22:53] Bitcoin is the same thing it's valuable
[22:55] because it's a network it's a base level
[22:58] Network because it has democratized and
[23:01] decentralized value right and that's the
[23:03] one element that the internet left out
[23:06] and so when people talk about um well
[23:08] all these other crypto and all these
[23:09] other coins can do all these other
[23:11] things well when the internet started in
[23:13] in the 1960s it was just a military and
[23:15] Academic email server it really hasn't
[23:19] changed the the internet is the same
[23:21] slow Dumb kind of um base Foundation but
[23:27] we built everything on top right www
[23:30] HTTP you know um is the internet a
[23:33] theater yeah to some the internet's a
[23:35] theater like the internet can be so many
[23:37] things and I think the Bitcoin that
[23:39] Bitcoin is is pretty much the same thing
[23:41] and it's because if Bitcoin wasn't an
[23:44] asset with a market value I think people
[23:46] would understand Bitcoin more because
[23:48] when we talk about Bitcoin we always
[23:50] talk about the network that's what's so
[23:52] valuable it's the network it's the
[23:53] database it's the decentralization
[23:56] permissionless of oper operating and
[23:58] using this Ledger of truth it's because
[24:02] there's an asset people are confused
[24:04] what's what is it that's why they think
[24:05] it needs to be a company and literally
[24:07] if the internet just tomorrow said
[24:09] there's an internet token and it's and
[24:10] its price is going to reflect how
[24:12] valuable it is how many people are going
[24:14] to use the internet want the internet I
[24:17] mean look at how valuable it is right
[24:18] we're using it right now to record
[24:19] everyone's using it and if there was a
[24:21] token that represented that value that's
[24:24] Bitcoin so I I like that as an analogy
[24:28] to help explain it when people first
[24:30] start off with what is bitcoin it's like
[24:32] PE stop talking about the asset and the
[24:34] price it's it's the network
[24:37] um that's how valuable it is yeah that
[24:41] that's extremely powerful uh like first
[24:44] all of the friends analogy because I was
[24:46] a big friends fan uh and I know even
[24:49] bigger fans are my girlfriend and my mom
[24:52] uh so I might have like to check that
[24:54] part of the book out and and give it to
[24:55] them so they they they might understand
[24:57] Bitcoin fin
[24:59] and I Lov I never heard that analogy
[25:02] with the pizza like that was something
[25:04] completely new with uh where they just
[25:06] change numbers I heard a lot of
[25:07] different ways of how to describe
[25:09] inflation but I think the pizza one is a
[25:12] a powerful one because then you get like
[25:14] all all of a sudden uh you promise to
[25:16] like pay one slice but that one slice is
[25:19] just half a slice basically and that's
[25:22] like a really powerful analogy what you
[25:25] make here yeah yeah it's like going back
[25:28] to to whether it was the you know the
[25:30] coin clipping or whether it was debasing
[25:32] the metals and it's like you know no
[25:34] one's clipping our Fiat no one's
[25:35] clipping the dollars but yeah that and
[25:38] since they don't want to change the
[25:39] number on us because that's obvious
[25:41] inflation well we just put more in there
[25:43] but it's the same thing definitely
[25:45] definitely um also like the the tcpip I
[25:48] always like uh to to uh compare it to
[25:51] the tcpip protocol or like kind of the
[25:53] the internet uh protocol where I'm like
[25:56] imagine you could invest uh in like
[26:00] 1992 in the in the the whole Internet
[26:03] Protocol where later on Facebook Google
[26:05] Microsoft all those great companies are
[26:07] built on top of that and you can benefit
[26:11] from everything that is built on top of
[26:13] that and that's basically Bitcoin like
[26:16] Bitcoin is starting out it's a protocol
[26:18] there are so many great things builded
[26:19] on top of that uh no matter if it's like
[26:22] an ETF or lightning or whatever it's
[26:24] built on top of Bitcoin uh everything
[26:27] triggers down in the base asset and you
[26:30] can own it even if you're like in a
[26:32] third world country and you're somewhere
[26:35] with an internet connection a phone uh
[26:37] like there even like Solutions where you
[26:39] don't even have to have internet
[26:40] connection but uh it's a different topic
[26:43] uh and you can just like have the base
[26:44] layer and benefit the same way as
[26:47] everyone benefits from from from Bitcoin
[26:50] and that's a really powerful thing that
[26:52] a l lot of people um right
[26:56] get yeah and and Satoshi figured out
[26:59] early on you know that that to solve
[27:01] this
[27:02] because uh so many of the failures that
[27:05] we have today in any system are because
[27:07] of
[27:08] humans he he he knew he had to remove
[27:11] humans but he realized he had to use
[27:13] humans in a way to incentivize them so
[27:16] we took the failures of the humans which
[27:17] is greed and used greed to add Bitcoin
[27:22] the token on bitcoin the network because
[27:23] with greed we all want Bitcoin the token
[27:26] to go up so we're going to continue to
[27:27] buy it which will support the miners
[27:30] which will support this energy wall of
[27:33] security which helps support the nodes
[27:35] which helps the money go up so it's this
[27:37] continuous feedback loop of human greed
[27:41] you know and because bitcoiners are
[27:42] disingenuous if they say oh they don't
[27:44] care about the price they only care
[27:45] about the network yeah but if you if the
[27:47] price goes down that that network will
[27:48] be less secure thank you you already
[27:50] made it halfway through the video and
[27:52] I'm really really grateful to have you
[27:54] here two things make this channel
[27:56] possible you as a watch and listener who
[27:59] keep supporting this Channel and another
[28:01] one is all the Bitcoin brands that I
[28:04] partner up with like 21 Bitcoin who
[28:06] support me from the very start and where
[28:08] I personally buy my Bitcoin from with
[28:10] code Robin you even get a discount when
[28:12] you buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[28:15] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[28:18] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[28:21] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[28:23] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[28:25] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[28:27] be be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[28:31] bracket and if you have self custody and
[28:33] you know your friend does not have maybe
[28:35] he needs a Christmas present maybe he
[28:37] needs a birth present and a small life
[28:39] hack if you use code Robin you get 5%
[28:42] off your order plus you support my
[28:45] channel and now let's get back to the
[28:47] video price is important as a as a
[28:48] marketing tool do you have an analogy
[28:52] for how valuable Bitcoin will be uh in
[28:56] like 00 years because I think like when
[28:59] you explain uh to new people outside of
[29:03] the Bitcoin world at Bitcoin uh they
[29:06] often like ask the question like oh how
[29:08] high can it g go and the the thing that
[29:11] they want to know is like oh what like
[29:13] what's the the market uh a total
[29:15] addressable Market of that like how high
[29:18] can such a thing as Bitcoin go and as
[29:21] the price the unit price and I hate that
[29:23] there's like a unit buy because like one
[29:25] Bitcoin is like really expensive but
[29:28] it's not about the unit it's about the
[29:29] whole thing um that's right so so like
[29:32] do you have an analogy or a thinking
[29:35] model of like um where Bitcoin of the
[29:38] value is going if Bitcoin is what we
[29:41] think it is sure well a couple of them
[29:44] so if I'm talking to real estate people
[29:46] because they always don't understand
[29:47] it's like well how can it this be so
[29:49] expensive and I said well look at the
[29:52] you know little old lady in Pasadena or
[29:53] look at someone's Grandma who's like oh
[29:55] I bought this house back in the day for
[29:56] $3,000 or
[29:58] $2,000 well how is that house a million
[30:01] dollars today so pretend that's Bitcoin
[30:05] today Bitcoin there's only 21 million
[30:08] houses this is a new zip code and right
[30:11] now today the houses are selling for you
[30:13] know $ 64
[30:15] $65,000 will that $64,000 house someday
[30:19] be worth a million dollar when some of
[30:22] the people that buy these houses are
[30:23] going to lose their keys this house will
[30:26] never deteriorate it'll never fall apart
[30:29] you'll never need to maintain it or
[30:30] whatever and by the way everyone is
[30:32] going to want to live here so without
[30:35] going through all of those reasons why
[30:36] because we know that alone clicks for
[30:39] real estate people because you know they
[30:42] are making more uh land they are making
[30:45] more real estate all over the world like
[30:46] there's actually plenty of it it it's
[30:48] true you finitely can't but it's also
[30:49] like saying a grain of sand is finite
[30:52] well yeah but there's tons of it right
[30:53] we're not going to run out of it so this
[30:55] is this is one ZIP code it's the big
[30:58] coin zip code 21 million houses and
[31:00] right now they're selling for $64,000 or
[31:03] you can also look at stocks so because
[31:05] stocks split so many times look how many
[31:07] times Apple has split Amazon Tesla we
[31:11] they think oh well the price is only you
[31:12] know and they have like you were just
[31:14] talking about unit bias right and they
[31:15] think oh this is only 80 bucks this only
[31:16] 100 bucks well look at um Warren
[31:19] Buffett's stock he's never split his
[31:21] Aeries stock right what's what's that
[31:24] stock worth isn't you would know it's
[31:25] probably $2 $300,000 or something I mean
[31:28] it started yeah it started at 10 cents
[31:31] so guess how it can get that high
[31:33] because it's not splitting see bitcoin's
[31:34] not going to split no one's going to
[31:36] have to split it and inflate on people
[31:38] or for people to think that it's cheaper
[31:41] in many ways I do wish that we we that
[31:44] all of the exchanges also sold Satoshi
[31:47] at the same time because with unit buy
[31:49] here in fact here is behind me right
[31:50] there 1,543 Satoshi for $1 at the moment
[31:54] like that sounds really good doesn't it
[31:57] so yeah it's definite unit bias um and
[32:01] as long as we as long as you are pricing
[32:04] Bitcoin in your Fiat wherever you live
[32:06] if you think the government's going to
[32:08] continue to print and continue to
[32:09] inflate well then Bitcoin will go up
[32:11] because Bitcoin is simply reflecting
[32:13] that Bitcoin is the scarce part that the
[32:16] Fiat isn't so it's just math and it and
[32:19] it will 100% have to go up
[32:22] also oh yeah go ahead no I just wanted
[32:26] to to make an example with real estate
[32:28] because I always hear that from real
[32:30] estate people like oh but like I know
[32:33] that real estate will always be valuable
[32:35] because people will always need a place
[32:37] to live in and there's like only so much
[32:39] place in the world and I'm like no you
[32:41] can like first of all like you can make
[32:42] a house and then you can build on top of
[32:44] the house then did you already seen the
[32:47] the development for Dubai what what
[32:49] they've built in the last like few
[32:51] decades they they just like added land
[32:54] in in the ocean uh or like just use some
[32:58] uh some variants of the big Sahara some
[33:00] big of where like there are a lot of
[33:02] places like even in Austria I'm living
[33:04] in Austria uh there is so much free
[33:08] space like you literally drive and then
[33:10] you don't see anyone for like 10 15
[33:13] minutes and then you see the next house
[33:15] like Austria is a small country and
[33:18] still there's so much space so I feel
[33:20] like is is really is that really that uh
[33:24] SC and then it's really not yeah I mean
[33:26] look at Miami look at Boston like
[33:28] they've added so much land that didn't
[33:30] even exist there and also as money
[33:33] continues to inflate and debase and
[33:35] devalue and and get more broken we're
[33:38] just going to compress people into less
[33:40] space you know we're going to get uglier
[33:42] buildings now they're four unit
[33:43] buildings now they're eight unit
[33:44] buildings smaller I mean look how many
[33:46] people are living at home with their
[33:47] parents right I mean maybe that's kind
[33:49] of a cool thing I don't know but it's
[33:51] you know it there's there's there's
[33:54] plenty of land and there's plenty of
[33:56] ways to build and houses you know if
[33:59] kind of like gold if the value of
[34:01] housing goes up people will keep making
[34:03] more housing they will find a way to
[34:04] make housing it will not
[34:06] stop because it's not scarce I mean gold
[34:09] is not scarce people talk about it being
[34:10] scarce it it's not
[34:12] scarce yeah because we don't even know
[34:14] like uh we might get technical
[34:16] advancements we might civilize other uh
[34:19] planets and then there's there another
[34:21] real estate maybe there's gold coming
[34:23] from there I don't know like there's so
[34:25] many possibilities of of that but even
[34:27] if we concentrated on Earth uh but yeah
[34:29] sorry I interrupted you before what what
[34:31] did you wanted to
[34:32] say oh uh no oh I was just going to say
[34:36] you know as far as talking about the the
[34:37] future price um in addition to using
[34:40] those two metaphors you know you just
[34:42] have to talk about the misallocation of
[34:44] capital and how many people are invested
[34:47] currently in things that they don't want
[34:48] they don't really want to be in because
[34:50] they're passively invested with their
[34:52] Brokers or they're in bonds which you
[34:54] know have been losing for the last 12
[34:55] years um or they're in Risky stocks and
[34:58] they're tired of taking those risks like
[35:00] how many people will start to just
[35:01] reallocate into Bitcoin whether it's as
[35:04] a first step through the ETFs or just
[35:06] through a a superior step by learning
[35:08] about Bitcoin in the first place I mean
[35:10] there's it sounds funny because even
[35:12] though Bitcoin is there to benefit the
[35:15] people that really need it the
[35:16] disenfranchised the the oppressed the
[35:18] surveilled the
[35:19] censored wealthy people have a big
[35:22] problem too they don't know where to put
[35:24] their Bitcoin I mean to put their money
[35:26] and Bitcoin is proving I mean it's just
[35:28] math you can look over 15 years you can
[35:30] look at the keger you can see how it's
[35:32] doing the security of it like there's
[35:35] nothing Superior to bitcoin so they're
[35:38] eventually going to come to it one way
[35:39] or another and I think that's also going
[35:42] to just drive the price up tremendously
[35:44] just capturing gold real estate and
[35:46] bonds alone like if you want to stay in
[35:49] stocks I get it some people want to stay
[35:50] in stocks you're basically 0% with
[35:52] inflation you basically are just riding
[35:54] in line with what inflation does but if
[35:57] you want to hurdle that and do something
[35:59] better for yourself and for your
[36:00] children um you know there's a faster
[36:03] horse in the race as they say I feel
[36:06] like even the Bitcoin becomes the new
[36:08] hurdle rate like it's more and Bitcoin
[36:10] grows and grows and grows and uh it
[36:13] becomes to new hurdle rate where when
[36:15] you really want to invest in stocks you
[36:18] have to do a really good job in finding
[36:21] like the really fast horses and really
[36:23] Emerging Markets to actually outpace
[36:26] Bitcoin that's why now not in in stocks
[36:29] i l picking stocks I like I L I'm in
[36:31] Austria and I have to stay up like till
[36:33] 1 2 300 a.m. in the morning oh my gosh
[36:36] see that the conference calls uh that
[36:38] was that American companies are doing I
[36:41] love doing that but I don't do it
[36:42] anymore because I don't see any
[36:44] opportunity as big as Bitcoin right now
[36:46] that might change in like 10 20 years
[36:49] then I might get a little bit more
[36:50] excited about other Investments again uh
[36:53] but if you really want to do that uh you
[36:55] you really have to be really good there
[36:58] might be some that can do it uh but it's
[37:00] it's it's a hard game it's tough because
[37:03] like people like you have to fight
[37:05] activity bias right because you have
[37:07] this knowledge and you want to go out
[37:09] there and trade and do fancy things with
[37:11] stocks but it's like you don't have to
[37:14] with Bitcoin it's it's really just like
[37:16] it's like ah you know just stop um and
[37:19] it's the same problem I have like I want
[37:21] to get I'm I still get sent all this
[37:22] stuff on real estate and all these
[37:24] things and I'm like oh this looks good
[37:25] oh this would be fun but I'm like well
[37:27] is it really fun you know I don't know
[37:29] if it's going to be that much fun and
[37:30] I'll make way more doing nothing just
[37:33] sitting in
[37:34] Bitcoin yeah it's interesting do you
[37:36] also see that the whole um that Bitcoin
[37:39] will suck up the whole financial energy
[37:41] of of real estate I always see it with
[37:43] myself I was in plans actually to to try
[37:46] out real estate before I discovered
[37:48] Bitcoin and then I discovered Bitcoin I
[37:50] threw out all my real estate plans
[37:52] because I was like oh what what do I
[37:54] have to do like this this work is to do
[37:56] this work and I have to taxes I have to
[37:59] make a company like everything that you
[38:02] have to do for actually making a real
[38:04] estate thing it's like starting a
[38:05] business it's not investing it's not
[38:07] saving it's actually kind of starting a
[38:09] business uh and uh I would been probably
[38:13] now in real estate investor if Bitcoin
[38:16] was not there so when we spin that more
[38:19] like Real Estate Investors will come to
[38:21] the realization Bitcoin might be better
[38:24] uh potential Real Estate Investors might
[38:26] be like oh I I'm just I just got to buy
[38:28] this digital property how do you see
[38:30] that is it's like real estate coming
[38:33] down and makes housing
[38:35] affordable so I see two things on one
[38:38] hand I don't think real estate will ever
[38:39] go away and I think it's always going to
[38:40] be attractive in fact if you ask most
[38:42] bitcoiners why they're saving they want
[38:44] to buy a house they want their Citadel
[38:46] right they want they want property they
[38:48] actually want real estate that actually
[38:50] is the end goal for many bitcoiners but
[38:53] I think it will remove a lot of the
[38:56] monetization we have to do with
[38:58] investment properties for a lot of
[39:00] properties that people are buying that
[39:02] they don't plan to live in or want to
[39:03] live in you know and so just look at
[39:06] Commercial Real Estate right like one of
[39:07] the biggest parts of real estate is
[39:09] commercial real estate and what that is
[39:10] is there's these syndicates where like
[39:12] you Robin will put in $25,000 I'll put
[39:15] in 25,000 and hundreds of others will
[39:18] put in 25,000 and we'll go buy a 300
[39:20] unit apartment building and we'll put in
[39:22] new floors new windows we'll paint it
[39:24] we'll hang on to it for three years
[39:25] increase the rents sell it maybe we make
[39:28] about 15 20% a year that's very standard
[39:32] and I've done 30 40 of those right
[39:35] they're they're called real estate
[39:36] syndicates that's most that's that's a
[39:39] majority of what's going on out there
[39:41] you don't have to do that um not only is
[39:44] it making way less than you would in
[39:47] Bitcoin it's you have to do a lot of
[39:49] homework you're watching a lot of
[39:50] webinars you're paying you have to trust
[39:52] by the way many of these have broken
[39:54] down I've lost money on these you know
[39:56] people have run off with the money they
[39:57] haven't done what they said they would
[39:58] do they bought at the wrong time at the
[40:00] wrong place jurisdictional rules have
[40:02] changed someone's put in an airport
[40:04] right next door um someone fell off a
[40:07] balcony and sued the building like
[40:09] there's just there's a lot of risk
[40:10] there's a lot of
[40:11] liability and then of course you know
[40:13] airb bees have been a very popular Trend
[40:16] I was part of that I had places in
[40:17] Joshua Tree Palm Springs Nashville
[40:20] Austin I had them all over and I thought
[40:22] it was a genius but you know I'm on the
[40:24] phone 24/7 and dealing with complaints
[40:27] and I never really got to use them or
[40:29] enjoy them I bought them all in places
[40:31] that I thought I would like and I was
[40:34] you know when Co hit I sold them all and
[40:36] put them all into Bitcoin I said uh and
[40:39] it's you know it's been so nice it's
[40:40] just been you know stressfree ever since
[40:44] it's funny how co uh was such a huge
[40:47] Catalyst for people to stop and think
[40:51] and actually go in whole different
[40:53] directions it was everything even though
[40:55] I came in in 2017 2020 really hammered
[40:59] at home really just like oh wow you
[41:03] know probably another one right they say
[41:06] there's a bird flu or something coming I
[41:07] don't I don't
[41:09] know I'm I'm always the last to know
[41:11] about those stuff like I'm no All in the
[41:14] Family I I'm I'm so obsessed with
[41:17] Bitcoin and Technology like I'm I'm
[41:20] really now obsessed with podcasting and
[41:22] how to make this this whole thing uh go
[41:24] to the next level you're good at it
[41:26] which is great
[41:27] thank you thank you and but that's has
[41:30] the has the the side effects that I'm
[41:32] like really bad in anything that's going
[41:35] on like yesterday Austria played in the
[41:37] European championship and I got about it
[41:40] like a day before or something like
[41:42] that that's funny yeah it's tough I
[41:45] always think you know you podcasters are
[41:47] really doing satoshi's work because you
[41:49] know I I used to run a podcast back in
[41:52] the day I did 100 episodes and it's you
[41:54] know it's a lot of work booking the
[41:55] guests sometimes listening to to people
[41:57] that have said the same thing over and
[41:59] over people you know you're tired of
[42:00] listening to and then you've got to edit
[42:02] you've got to Quality Control push it
[42:04] out there Market it and it's like it's a
[42:06] lot of energy it's a lot of work um but
[42:09] you just but you keep doing it and I
[42:11] think you know we have this sort of
[42:14] recency bias you know even when people
[42:16] go on Netflix they they want to you know
[42:18] what's the latest movies what are the
[42:19] latest three or four even though you
[42:20] know you can dig in and find something
[42:22] good there's something about something
[42:23] being new so I might be saying the same
[42:26] thing you've heard and I probably am
[42:28] Robin probably 50 times it's okay you
[42:29] can say it but maybe there's someone new
[42:32] that's just finding your Channel or
[42:34] searching and this is a new you know
[42:36] this is you know June 2024 or whatever
[42:39] um and so people might watch this versus
[42:41] digging down into someone who is 10
[42:43] times better than me two years ago you
[42:45] know um so it's it's some of these
[42:49] things feel disposable but it's good
[42:52] that we continue to open up more
[42:53] doorways and Pathways for people to find
[42:55] you know and see what we see
[42:58] I even think that a podcast is the best
[43:02] way to have new content all the time
[43:05] because I myself I I I start doing that
[43:08] like solo episodes and stuff like that
[43:11] uh but the thing that I actually enjoy
[43:14] the most of the conversations because
[43:16] there's like actually new content coming
[43:18] in and even though yes there are a lot
[43:20] of things that are uh repetitive when
[43:24] you interview every day I'm doing every
[43:26] day a Bitcoin podcast
[43:27] uh you you hear a lot of the the same
[43:29] things but you always hear it in a
[43:31] different way and from a different
[43:34] person and that's what I'm really polish
[43:35] of like different people need different
[43:38] people to explain them Bitcoin like when
[43:42] I explain Bitcoin someone might get it
[43:44] and then when someone else explains it
[43:46] then all of someone else gets it so
[43:49] that's why I probably uh incapable of of
[43:52] orange buing some portion of of the
[43:54] person but then there's uh I don't know
[43:56] a friend of mine who also got Bitcoin uh
[43:59] he explains and then all of a sudden ah
[44:01] okay it makes sense for me now so that's
[44:02] why I think we need all of the voices
[44:05] and as many as we get and I'm famous for
[44:08] uh bringing people on my podcast uh that
[44:11] have never been on a podcast I have 10
[44:13] 15 20% of my guests are completely new
[44:17] uh I even got one podcast uh done
[44:20] yesterday with a guy who just commented
[44:23] on my YouTube videos such long comments
[44:25] and I thought thought they the comments
[44:28] are so good and I just like invited him
[44:30] and we made this podcast episode it was
[44:32] like over one and a half hours I enjoyed
[44:34] it so much it will be a banger episode
[44:36] I'm really looking forward to releasing
[44:37] it uh and so like new voices are amazing
[44:42] all yes I also have Jeff Bo and mich sa
[44:44] Natalie Brunell on yeah yeah you have a
[44:46] lot of the ogs yeah it's great to have
[44:49] them on but I heard them over and over
[44:52] again like Michael saor said some new
[44:54] stuff actually I never heard him saying
[44:56] that uh but but mostly I hear the stuff
[44:59] that I already heard from him because
[45:01] yeah he cannot have new content every
[45:03] podcast he that's impossible yeah I mean
[45:06] we're all saying the same thing I was
[45:07] complaining to someone else who does a
[45:09] lot of podcast I'm like sometimes I feel
[45:10] like I'm saying the same thing and he
[45:12] said to me keep saying the same thing
[45:14] different people will will hear that
[45:16] same thing so I'm like okay so it made
[45:18] me feel better and I watched uh Seinfeld
[45:21] I feel like already four times the whole
[45:23] thing yes I'm I'm one of the guys who is
[45:27] going on Netflix and when he watches I
[45:28] watch the same like seven TV series all
[45:32] over like I have like several that I
[45:34] watch like two or free times so I I I
[45:36] have not that I have not that recency
[45:38] bias on that that's good yeah that's
[45:41] good you can break that but uh i' I've
[45:44] seen one thing on on your profile that I
[45:47] really enjoyed uh and it was like the
[45:49] your PIN uh threet where you made this
[45:53] experiment what if uh the dollar is like
[45:57] you you basically put the properties of
[45:59] Bitcoin onto the dollar and made this
[46:01] mind uh switch for like what if the they
[46:04] only 21 million US Dollars and everyone
[46:07] wants the US Dollars that's that was
[46:10] amazing and I love that analogy um the
[46:13] the question that I I have with that uh
[46:16] uh is do you think it's possible still
[46:19] that we save the dollar it's like if if
[46:21] if someone really uh comes in in the
[46:24] office and say like yes I want to save
[46:26] the dollar and like revert all those
[46:28] money printing is it is are we still in
[46:30] the process of like we could save it or
[46:32] is it like it's just a Down Road and and
[46:35] nothing can stop
[46:37] it well it's a good question I mean I'm
[46:39] not one of those people that thinks that
[46:41] the dollar as a currency will ever be
[46:43] replaced I think we will always have the
[46:46] dollar you know it could go digital it
[46:48] could go cbdc that's not a good thing
[46:50] but I think we're always going to have
[46:51] the government is always going to want
[46:53] to have something they can control right
[46:55] and throughout history that has always
[46:56] been the case they will they will never
[46:58] give that up um and at least here in the
[47:03] United States you know we know that it
[47:05] it
[47:06] debases less than it does elsewhere so
[47:09] it still looks really good right people
[47:11] in Argentina Lebanon turkey you know
[47:14] parts of Africa the global South they
[47:16] they they absolutely want the dollar and
[47:18] some people will tell you that you know
[47:20] that that they'll they'll take the
[47:21] dollar over
[47:22] Bitcoin
[47:24] um but but are we now entering a phase
[47:28] where it's going to continue to to
[47:30] debase even more and even more and even
[47:33] absolutely yeah we are we are nearing
[47:35] the end but I don't know if that end is
[47:37] still 50 years away Robin that's the
[47:39] thing so to me that still feels like a
[47:42] long ways away and you
[47:44] know maybe just quickly for those who
[47:48] don't are aware with your pinned threat
[47:51] I loved it a lot how you dis described
[47:53] it and and how you you made that like
[47:57] perception switch of like oh imagine the
[47:59] US Dollars and and like can you can you
[48:02] run down this example a little bit Yeah
[48:05] in general it's just a sort of mind
[48:07] frame shift for people that don't
[48:08] understand how important Bitcoin
[48:11] scarcity is so everyone knows the dollar
[48:14] imagine that there are only $21 million
[48:16] in the system period there will never be
[48:19] more made that's it if someone loses a
[48:21] dollar or it gets burnt up crumpled
[48:23] there's even less but there will only be
[48:25] 21 million US Dollars ever so imagine
[48:29] how valuable a house might be someday an
[48:32] education a business what will $1 Buy in
[48:37] the future if this if this money supply
[48:39] isn't inflating and when you think about
[48:41] it in those terms is obvious and as
[48:43] Elementary as it is it really makes you
[48:45] think like well wait a minute I really
[48:47] want I want to work for these US Dollars
[48:49] well wait a I want to hang on to them I
[48:51] want to secure them I don't want to keep
[48:52] them in a bank I want self- custody them
[48:55] I don't want anyone else to take them
[48:56] because it's like you know having 21
[48:58] million rare baseball cards right as
[49:00] people lose them as they deteriorate if
[49:02] there's less and less it'll get that
[49:04] much more scarce and that much more
[49:06] important
[49:08] so um I just used that analogy because
[49:11] it made me think one day well if
[49:13] everyone just likes the dollar and
[49:14] understands the dollar would they like
[49:16] it and understand it more if it was
[49:18] ultimately scarce and getting more
[49:20] scarce because in that example there's
[49:23] really I think I forget who said it but
[49:25] they were I think I think it's 17 or
[49:27] even less like
[49:29] 16.8 million Bitcoin are all that are
[49:31] really accessible so we're really not up
[49:34] at even at 21 million when you count
[49:36] satoshi's wallet and all the Lost coins
[49:38] from the
[49:40] ogs
[49:42] um so talking to someone who doesn't
[49:44] understand Bitcoin at all just about
[49:46] dollars being scarce and never being
[49:48] more it makes you reframe what you think
[49:51] of the dollar and how valuable a dollar
[49:53] is that you're not going to just give it
[49:54] up for cheap Goods you're going to try
[49:57] to create rather than consume you're G
[49:59] to want to save rather than spend you
[50:01] might want to build rather than gamble
[50:04] um so yeah that's what that I I probably
[50:07] said it better in the pen
[50:10] but the the thing that also came up in
[50:12] my mind was now like when when we have
[50:15] like this number of like maybe there are
[50:17] 60 million that are actually movable and
[50:19] and and still there I think it's
[50:22] underrated uh the amount of ogs that are
[50:25] like saying I will die with my Bitcoins
[50:28] I will not like I will make sacrifice
[50:31] for the community and make Bitcoin even
[50:33] more scarce I will not put it out there
[50:36] uh and they have like thousands of
[50:38] Bitcoins because they bought at like I
[50:40] don't know 20 EUR or maybe even under
[50:42] EUR or something like that um I think
[50:45] those who will never move the coins will
[50:48] be probably probably underrated it's
[50:50] impossible to know about it uh but there
[50:53] are some ogs they are like just like
[50:55] really happy with the life and then
[50:57] they're just like uh like saor might be
[51:00] one of those
[51:02] right talk about that right yeah he
[51:05] talked about how you are making a
[51:07] selfless donation to the entire network
[51:09] by simply dying with your Bitcoin you
[51:12] know and I think it's a beautiful thing
[51:14] to think about because you know over at
[51:17] the Bitcoin advisor you know I help a
[51:19] lot of high net worth individuals figure
[51:21] out what to do when they die and how to
[51:22] get their coins to their heirs and their
[51:25] children
[51:26] but some of them don't have children
[51:28] some of them do have a lot of Bitcoin
[51:30] and they're like well what do I do with
[51:31] this who who do I give it to you know
[51:33] which charity should I give it to and
[51:36] the other day I was telling this one
[51:38] client it just popped out in my head but
[51:40] based on what sailor has said I said if
[51:42] you can't think of a Good Charity to
[51:43] give it to just die with it because
[51:45] that'll be the best charity because
[51:46] you're giving it to everybody who really
[51:48] needs it everyone who's holding Bitcoin
[51:50] currently it becomes that much more
[51:52] scarce and that much more valuable and
[51:54] he was like oh my God that's that's what
[51:56] I'm going to
[51:58] do so think about that right it's
[52:02] yeah it's pretty
[52:04] incredible I I have closer to my end and
[52:07] uh and oh yes a
[52:10] very what's the difference what's the
[52:13] opposite of selfless a very selfish uh
[52:16] question um I think a lot about
[52:20] podcasting and how we can make the best
[52:23] out of a conversation because if you
[52:25] have a conversation you want to have
[52:26] have like a really good conversation uh
[52:28] and then ask that question because you
[52:30] said before that you're nering out about
[52:31] messaging what I started to do is like
[52:35] put a trailer in front of the podcast uh
[52:38] to give like some Snippets like 30
[52:41] seconds 40 seconds 50 seconds sometimes
[52:44] even like one minute and 20 if there's
[52:46] like really a lot in the podcast but
[52:48] it's rare uh that gives the few a little
[52:51] bit of uh of like what's in there and I
[52:55] approached it and as a cinema trail
[52:58] trailer they are showing scenes of it
[53:01] but not like narro narrowing a lot
[53:03] they're just like showing scenes and
[53:04] they kind of Mak sense and that's what I
[53:06] try to do make a a small story in front
[53:09] of that obviously I'm really bad in this
[53:11] because I'm just signing out no but I
[53:12] like it I know what you're talking about
[53:13] yeah I like it and I try to do that uh
[53:17] and other than that I have not a lot
[53:19] like I just like have the questions and
[53:20] and the conversation keep it really raw
[53:23] is there anything that you would say
[53:25] like um uh from a messaging perspective
[53:27] from a podcast perspective because a lot
[53:30] of podcasting do that with the trailer
[53:32] and then have just a raw conversation uh
[53:35] is there anything that you like you
[53:36] would incorporate that I don't know
[53:39] like TV shows after a lot like they have
[53:42] a a trailer or like something from the
[53:46] back episode the open and then like
[53:49] there's like this this this theme song
[53:51] this like 10 seconds 20 seconds like do
[53:54] you have any recommendation for me to
[53:55] improve the the podcast and the then the
[53:58] messaging wow um so first of all I think
[54:01] you're doing a great job like I I listen
[54:03] to a lot of podcast and there's some
[54:06] extremely big ones I won't name them
[54:08] like that are popular where you know
[54:10] they talk for 30 minutes about nonsense
[54:13] before it even starts like that kind of
[54:15] bums me out because I just want to get
[54:16] to the good Bitcoin stuff um I think
[54:21] what has been working with television
[54:23] works with podcast and that's that you
[54:25] have a cold open you don't explain just
[54:27] boom get into great sound bites and you
[54:29] can you can even cut them up great sound
[54:31] bite just jump cut great sound bite jump
[54:33] cut great sound bite and then you know
[54:36] I'm Robin seir here's my podcast you
[54:38] know today we're with blah blah blah and
[54:40] you just go in just like get into the
[54:42] meat as quickly as possible if you have
[54:44] to like I know we like learning people's
[54:46] origin stories but I would maybe stick I
[54:48] would personally cut those up and put
[54:51] the origin story towards the end like we
[54:53] didn't have to we didn't do that with me
[54:54] but like on some podcasts they for 20
[54:56] minutes have asked about me and I'm like
[54:59] I think they want to hear about Bitcoin
[55:00] but but you know put that at the end
[55:02] because once they've heard about Bitcoin
[55:03] they might be like oh I like this guy
[55:05] how did he learn about Bitcoin I don't
[55:07] know I don't know if that helps because
[55:08] you're doing a really good job I've seen
[55:10] what you're doing um and I like it I
[55:12] mean it looks very professional I I've
[55:15] uh I found the starting only with the
[55:18] first ever like with the first two
[55:20] episodes I did uh made an introduction
[55:22] for the guest that I um record after the
[55:27] podcast episode uh since then I'm just
[55:29] doing the trailers uh but I never asked
[55:32] like who are you what are you doing like
[55:35] I I feel like um they can people can
[55:38] look that up yeah or or you can have a
[55:41] show note yeah they have a show note uh
[55:44] and I always like have a a link to the
[55:46] the main contact of of the of the the
[55:50] person so I'm like they can look where
[55:52] this is they have like a link tree or
[55:54] something like that they can see more
[55:56] that's right um but but I I'm I'm never
[56:01] interested in in in having like this
[56:03] like oh 10 minutes we're talking about
[56:05] like what do you do and stuff like that
[56:07] uh maybe a little bit uh if it's
[56:09] interesting uh and sometimes we do that
[56:11] but only if it's if it's interesting for
[56:13] me yeah thank you for for your answer
[56:15] I'm always like trying to to to get the
[56:17] best out of a podcast I just don't need
[56:20] to hear about you know football for 30
[56:22] minutes in London just put it that way
[56:28] perfect um okay perfect then we come to
[56:31] the end routine of the podcast uh it has
[56:33] two questions the first question is
[56:35] always the same one and the second
[56:37] question uh comes from the previous
[56:39] guest uh the first question uh is and I
[56:43] asked that because I think bitcoiners
[56:45] are really unique people and we can
[56:46] learn from each other the question is
[56:48] what are we currently passionate what
[56:50] what are you currently passionate about
[56:52] besides Bitcoin or what are you
[56:54] currently learning about besides Bitcoin
[56:57] oh outside of
[57:00] Bitcoin
[57:04] uh I'm learning about AI because I think
[57:08] and not because I just like AI as AI but
[57:10] because I think AI is going to want to
[57:12] use Bitcoin for everything because with
[57:14] all the knowledge AI has which really is
[57:17] just scrubbing and crawling the internet
[57:19] and all data and all information so if
[57:22] that's in a sense a perfect human of
[57:23] having all this information what money
[57:26] would that system choose it's going to
[57:28] look at everything it's going to look at
[57:29] the history of scams and whatnot and
[57:31] it's going to choose
[57:34] Bitcoin yeah yeah yeah it's a big one I
[57:37] I often think about like how much AI did
[57:40] I use a year ago and how much AI do I
[57:42] use now it's like not not even close
[57:45] it's a a whole different level the other
[57:48] day was chipd falling out and I was
[57:52] actually like oh [ __ ] I cannot
[57:54] work I have my process I have my gbts
[57:57] that I need actually for work and then I
[57:59] was like oh I have to do it manually I
[58:01] have to do research now
[58:04] yeah uh but it it bumped me out perfect
[58:07] then let's come to the end routine where
[58:09] the previous guest is asking a question
[58:11] for the next guest without knowing who
[58:12] the next guest actually is and the
[58:15] question for you is what in your
[58:17] childhood leted you to question the
[58:19] world around you so ultimately let you
[58:22] do to discover Bitcoin
[58:26] uh I'm sorry could you repeat that one
[58:27] more time uh yes I also did not
[58:30] understand it actually when he said it
[58:32] first it's okay I I just what what in
[58:35] your childhood uh LED you to question
[58:38] the world around you which now
[58:41] ultimately let you to understand
[58:44] Bitcoin oh uh the hustle at at a very
[58:48] young early age I realized that we're
[58:50] all playing a game and that you have to
[58:52] hustle uh to make more money and and
[58:57] uh
[58:59] and I didn't necessarily want to be a
[59:02] hustler um and so that helped lead me to
[59:06] bitcoin to realize that I don't I don't
[59:07] have to hustle and I used to be that guy
[59:09] I've written books about it like I you
[59:11] know passive income making money while
[59:12] you sleep you know how to create courses
[59:14] how to like I was that guy and it's an
[59:17] embarrassing I cringe at that person now
[59:19] I cringe because I I didn't have to be
[59:22] that person but I thought I had to I I
[59:24] was good at it but um
[59:26] uh I mean that's the the the ultimate
[59:29] goal to progress so much in life that
[59:31] you cringe at your younger self yeah
[59:35] exactly perfect then yeah thank you

[59:42] find you and ask you
[59:44] questions uh proof of money at on
