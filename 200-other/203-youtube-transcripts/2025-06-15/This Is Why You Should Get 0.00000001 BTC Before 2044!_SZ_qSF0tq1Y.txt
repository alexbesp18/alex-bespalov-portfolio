[00:00] It is no longer a question if we come to
[00:02] a Bitcoin world. It's it's a question of
[00:04] how fast we will get there, how violent
[00:07] or peaceful we will get there, and how
[00:10] will the way to that future will look
[00:13] like. You don't really own your home.
[00:15] You don't really own any stocks. You
[00:18] don't really own anything other than
[00:20] Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the only
[00:21] thing that you can store in your head.
[00:23] The future monetary standard is a sound
[00:26] monetary standard. A Satoshi can be
[00:28] worth $1 billion. It won't be measured
[00:32] in that way because if a Satoshi is $1
[00:34] billion, nobody cares about the dollars
[00:36] anymore. And I'm looking at the history
[00:38] right now. I'm looking at the printing
[00:40] press, the steam engine, the
[00:42] electricity, the transistor, like all
[00:45] those historical examples and see how
[00:48] did they change society and what impact
[00:52] Bitcoin will have onto our society.
[00:57] [Music]
[01:00] I had such an amazing conversation on
[01:02] the live stream with Momo. So I wanted
[01:04] to also put this episode out here and
[01:07] give it to all of you because we talked
[01:08] about how hyper bitcoinization will
[01:11] actually unfold. We talked about
[01:14] historic examples of how we can think
[01:17] about what it means that we are going to
[01:19] a hyper bitcoinized world to a bitcoin
[01:21] standard. We talked about uh
[01:23] self-custody strategies. We talked about
[01:26] uh life in general. We talked we talked
[01:28] about so many things but the most
[01:30] important thing that we talked about is
[01:32] is Bitcoin and how the Bitcoin standard
[01:36] will actually unfold. So enjoy. I know
[01:39] that your background is was in IT
[01:42] security and what is your go-to answer
[01:46] when someone talks about quantum
[01:49] computers and Bitcoin? There's two
[01:51] things. The first thing is yes, we have
[01:55] to care for that. Um it's a threat that
[01:58] that might be very valid in the future.
[02:01] So it's not something that we should
[02:03] just swipe away and say, "Oh, it will
[02:06] never be uh dangerous. It won't be
[02:10] any care. It might just be uh a threat
[02:14] to Bitcoin." So, and there are already
[02:17] solutions and proposals out there and
[02:20] way smarter people to talk on that topic
[02:22] than than than I can ever be. And that
[02:26] gives me a lot of hope that we can
[02:28] actually move towards that if that ever
[02:31] comes to be a threat. The second part is
[02:34] if you talk to a lot of experts in the
[02:37] field, they all tell you it's not
[02:40] tomorrow. Um, it's it's it's a threat
[02:43] that does not come right around the
[02:45] corner, but we have to be aware of that.
[02:48] And the big thing is with with quantum
[02:51] computers
[02:54] is why would they attack Bitcoin if
[02:58] there are so many other systems like
[03:02] every other system that's an easier
[03:05] target with more monetary value in them?
[03:09] that the fiat system is way way less
[03:12] secure than the Bitcoin system. Why? If
[03:16] if I have if I have a quantum computer
[03:20] that can that can break all the
[03:22] algorithms, can break all the things,
[03:25] why would I choose Bitcoin to break into
[03:29] if it's way more secure and way harder
[03:32] to crack than any bank account, any
[03:37] other system that I can just get
[03:40] probably more money out of in the total
[03:42] because there's a lot more money in fiat
[03:44] still than in Bitcoin. a lot more. So
[03:46] why would I even attack Bitcoin in the
[03:49] first place? So that there's also a game
[03:50] theory aspect to it. But at some point
[03:53] Bitcoin will be um bigger bigger and and
[03:56] the the the target will be just way way
[03:59] more attractive. So we have to already
[04:02] think about that and there are great
[04:04] people. I think Bitcoin Mechanics is his
[04:06] name. Um, I might confuse him with
[04:09] someone else, but I think he's really
[04:11] good on on on that topic. And there are
[04:13] like three, four other people that are
[04:14] really good and have good proposals and
[04:16] stuff like that that are on the
[04:19] technical level just way better than
[04:21] than me. I and yes, I I worked in IT
[04:23] security, but I worked on the economic
[04:25] side of IT security. So, I was not a
[04:27] hardcore uh coder. I was not a hardcore
[04:31] um developer of cryptographic stuff and
[04:34] uh and things like that. But I did have
[04:37] some rudimentary understanding of
[04:40] software development because I learned
[04:42] that in school. But I'm I'm I'm I'm not
[04:45] an IT security expert per se. Yeah. And
[04:50] uh the comparison between Bitcoin and uh
[04:53] your central bank is that uh with
[04:55] Christian Logart and Jeremy Powell uh
[04:58] they would set the password with all
[05:01] their accesses, the name of their
[05:03] mistress or lover plus the year of their
[05:06] birth with one uh special character. So
[05:10] that is way easier to crack and even the
[05:12] cryptography there is much easier to
[05:14] crack and there are so many people who
[05:16] have access to those data with the low
[05:20] security hygiene but with your bitcoin
[05:23] uh ideally only you have access to it
[05:25] and not the whole network is compromised
[05:28] and it is as you said it is going to
[05:30] happen in steps it's a real threat that
[05:32] algorithms are out there and people
[05:36] might even smarter people might come up
[05:39] with even more efficient algorithms. We
[05:43] shouldn't just sleep on that. But it is
[05:46] not that
[05:47] uh we have left it. We are not thinking
[05:50] about it and that uh that uh there are
[05:55] not solutions for
[05:57] it. Yeah. Any time in history when
[06:00] there's a technology that is like I say
[06:04] a fork in the road of human
[06:06] civilization like electricity was like
[06:10] the printing press was like all those
[06:12] great
[06:13] innovations were there's a lot of
[06:16] resistance against that because it poses
[06:19] a a big big change to society. We all
[06:24] remember those memes where or that
[06:27] actual actual thing that happens but is
[06:30] now a meme in Bitcoin. The anti-
[06:32] electricity fut. There were people
[06:34] saying, "Oh, electricity is bad. It will
[06:37] it will kill your kids. Electricity will
[06:41] uh microwave the whole world.
[06:43] Electricity is so bad." The same thing
[06:47] happened with all the other technology
[06:49] technologial advancements. The internet
[06:52] was a big controversial stuff. It's all
[06:54] it's still controversial. There are
[06:55] still people say, "Oh, the internet is
[06:57] really bad. We should go back before the
[06:59] internet. We should go back out of
[07:01] electricity." Which will never happen,
[07:03] by the way. But there's always a
[07:05] resistance coming up. And it's so funny
[07:07] to watch how something new has to be
[07:11] perfect. And the old incumbent system is
[07:15] not getting questioned at all.
[07:17] Nobody asks, "Hey, is my bank account
[07:21] quantum resistance?" Like, nobody asks
[07:24] that. Nobody asks, "Is my Amazon account
[07:27] resistance against that?" But we ask
[07:30] that with Bitcoin, with the most secure
[07:33] network there is in the whole world.
[07:35] Dare we ask it like why do we do that?
[07:39] We we should ask the in the insecure the
[07:42] the unsecure systems the IT systems that
[07:45] there are already that have no security
[07:49] at all are completely centralized are
[07:51] controlled as you said with username and
[07:52] password somewhere with two
[07:54] factorification and we all know from IT
[07:56] security the biggest threat is not a
[07:59] techn technology threat the biggest
[08:01] threat is the human being like you can
[08:05] you can make a huge wall and make it
[08:09] really really secure. But if the gu if
[08:12] the the guard that holds the key to that
[08:15] wall just lets you in, it doesn't matter
[08:18] how big of a wall you build. And uh
[08:21] that's the thing where we should focus
[08:24] on. We should we should educate people
[08:26] on on how to not fall for Bitcoin tricks
[08:29] and and how to not because that happens
[08:31] on on probably almost daily basis that
[08:34] someone loses their Bitcoin, loses their
[08:36] money, loses other cryptos probably even
[08:39] um because they haven't been educated on
[08:43] scams. There are so many impersonators
[08:46] uh from me. There are so many
[08:47] impersonators from all the the
[08:49] Bitcoiners out there that talk to the
[08:52] people every day and they're still
[08:54] trying to to they're still managing to
[08:57] fund themselves with those scams.
[08:59] So I think we first should fix the
[09:03] social aspect of of the anti-security
[09:05] thing and we should talk about how bad
[09:09] uh the security of Amazon, of Google, of
[09:13] the fiat system is how great the
[09:17] security is on Bitcoin and yes we should
[09:20] be critical and yes we should be saying
[09:22] hey we should up upgrade the code at
[09:26] some point to make it resistance But
[09:29] this is not a discussion we have to have
[09:32] uh that we have to do now. It's a
[09:34] discussion that we have the discussion
[09:36] is already happening but it's not an
[09:37] action step that we have to take
[09:40] now. So this is the one thing and the
[09:43] other thing as I said um when such an
[09:46] invention comes and it gets questioned
[09:48] by the incumbent system it's natural to
[09:51] do that. Electricity had gone through
[09:53] that, internet had gone through that and
[09:54] all all the innovations have gone
[09:56] through that. But it's important to note
[10:00] that it's inevitable like you have
[10:03] electricity comes in and the person that
[10:05] has
[10:06] electricity has an extreme advantage
[10:09] over the person that does not have
[10:10] electricity. It's the same thing with
[10:13] gunpowder. If you can come to a fist
[10:15] fight with a gun, you win that fight
[10:18] because you can shoot the other people.
[10:20] They can be really muscular. They can be
[10:22] fast. They can be whatever they can be.
[10:25] You can just shoot them. The same thing
[10:27] can happen with electricity. If you are
[10:30] the only town in the whole country that
[10:34] has electricity, you will be the most
[10:36] prosperous town in the whole country. If
[10:40] you are the only town that sets on a
[10:43] Bitcoin standard, you will be the most
[10:45] prosperous town in the whole country.
[10:48] The same thing with all technology. You
[10:51] have to embrace it or you will get left
[10:55] behind. And there's still places without
[10:57] electricity in in in this world. There
[10:59] are still places without internet in the
[11:01] world. And there are still places
[11:02] without the Bitcoin in the world. So we
[11:05] have a lot of education to do. We have a
[11:07] lot of building infrastructures to do.
[11:10] And we are in a good way to to to get
[11:13] there. But the resistance is normal. And
[11:16] those who uh buy into those resistance
[11:20] thought that technology always gets he
[11:24] will also get left behind. Yeah. And uh
[11:26] there are so many uh more advanced tech
[11:30] techniques of scamming people that comes
[11:33] along. Uh right the previous session on
[11:36] previous live I was talking to Zia and
[11:38] he was talking about the pig butchering
[11:41] scam. It's a new scam. Maybe you have
[11:44] already received messages on Telegram
[11:46] like that that someone writes to you
[11:49] instead of saying hey Robin they say
[11:51] that hey Dave I just arrived at the
[11:53] airport
[11:55] um come pick me up or something like
[11:57] that and then oh I know it it was a
[12:00] mistake and they start to make a
[12:04] personal connection with you. Uh and
[12:07] after some time uh if you want a video
[12:11] call they would even do the video call
[12:13] with you voice message you receive the
[12:16] voice message so you are sure about the
[12:18] gender of the other person on the the
[12:20] person on the other end end of the line
[12:22] and it might take three months for them
[12:25] to launch the attack and then they don't
[12:27] attack you directly they first say that
[12:30] oh there is this crypto on on Coinbase
[12:33] or you can make this account on Coinbase
[12:35] transfer money like that, which is
[12:36] legit. Coinbase with all the criticisms,
[12:39] it works and
[12:42] um it's not a scam for that person at
[12:46] least and uh that is beneficial to that
[12:49] person. But then they will uh they will
[12:53] introduce a website to you that is their
[12:56] own and it is a total scam. So they are
[12:59] a kind of low time preference generation
[13:02] of scammers that are uh coming coming in
[13:06] and we need to be really careful about
[13:08] them especially with the raise of AI.
[13:09] They might even not need a person on the
[13:12] other end and they would use voice
[13:14] changers or image producers to give you
[13:18] the illusion that you are talking to a
[13:19] human. Yeah, it's that's interesting. I
[13:22] never got that one. I always get job
[13:24] offers on on Telegram.
[13:27] Chop off? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Job
[13:28] hoppers. I I think I think LinkedIn
[13:30] LinkedIn is to blame for that. Yeah,
[13:34] it's it's so annoying. Uh you get so
[13:36] many messages. I got the the scam that
[13:40] Larry Le fell for and I think even Lynn
[13:43] Alden also I'm not sure uh the one where
[13:47] you get invited to an interview uh of
[13:49] Bloomberg or something like that and
[13:51] then you open like Google calendar and
[13:52] then there's some weird scam going on uh
[13:55] where you give the the rights to the to
[13:58] the tool and it's really nicely done
[13:59] actually uh from Twitter and then they
[14:02] can tweet in your name.
[14:05] I got that I think already like seven
[14:07] times. But yeah, I I saw it because I
[14:10] saw it before Larry. I don't know if I
[14:12] have would have fell for it because it
[14:15] was really sketchy and very different to
[14:17] all other interview uh invites, but
[14:20] especially if you're such uh a busy
[14:23] person like Lear and you just go quickly
[14:26] through messages, you can fall for that
[14:28] very easily, very very easily and and
[14:31] quickly also. So, um, the scams are
[14:34] getting good. they they know who to
[14:36] target and they know how to target
[14:40] them and yeah be aware of of anything
[14:44] going on and and before clicking on a
[14:47] link like just double check it or use
[14:50] some sandbox or uh after you click a
[14:53] link see what you're actually agreeing
[14:55] on because it was not the the scam with
[14:58] with le so from what I've seen is they
[15:02] clicked on a link and there nothing was
[15:04] wrong. Then an app that was seemingly
[15:09] Google Calendar wanted to have access to
[15:11] Twitter, but it was not the actual
[15:14] Google Calendar. It just looked really
[15:16] good like Google Calendar and then you
[15:18] click on it and then you gave their
[15:20] application the right to post on your
[15:23] Twitter. So Larry's Twitter did not get
[15:26] hacked.
[15:28] He granted
[15:30] the attackers access to post on their
[15:34] Twitter and then they posted a lot of
[15:36] weird things. Then Larry got pa b b b b
[15:38] b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
[15:38] b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b banned
[15:38] from Twitter because Twitter was like,
[15:40] "Oh, like what is he posting?" Uh so the
[15:43] whole
[15:44] story. But I think it should teach us
[15:47] that we should be really careful of
[15:48] social engineering. That's the most most
[15:52] most IT security things would be solved
[15:55] if we would eliminate social
[15:57] engineering. If social engineering is
[15:59] zero like like nobody would fall for
[16:02] those things which will never be
[16:04] accomplished but if it if it would be to
[16:06] zero
[16:07] uh it security would be so
[16:10] easy that's why there are so many
[16:14] uh courses so many uh offerings out
[16:17] there to defend yourself against social
[16:20] engineering because they are just so
[16:22] good and they they they reach the right
[16:25] people and it's a it's a numbers game
[16:27] you know like you you you can write like
[16:31] 500 people with one scam or maybe like
[16:34] 5,000 people and you only need let's say
[16:38] tend to fall for it. You you don't need
[16:40] most people don't fall for it. Most
[16:42] people actually are are are clever and
[16:44] don't fall for it or are aware in that
[16:46] situation and don't fall for it. But
[16:49] those 5% or 2% that fall for it, it's
[16:53] already a profit. They they they already
[16:55] make the money back. So uh that's what's
[16:58] uh that's why they are so so so
[17:00] successful because they don't need a lot
[17:02] of people to fall for it. Yeah,
[17:03] definitely. And with respect to Bitcoin,
[17:06] when I came into Bitcoin, one of the
[17:08] strangest things that I had to come into
[17:10] terms with was that there are 12 words
[17:13] on one line and those 12 words were the
[17:16] key to recover my Bitcoin. And I I think
[17:19] I accident I uh on purpose removed my uh
[17:23] bitcoin wallet and I restored it from
[17:26] that. It was electron wallet my first
[17:28] wallet uh to just see how those 12 words
[17:31] work because I was very much used to
[17:34] having a username and password and the
[17:36] fact that I hadn't made a username and
[17:38] password on electron's website I was
[17:39] like wow where is my bitcoin? So that
[17:42] was one of the strangest things that I
[17:44] had to deal with from uh the start and
[17:47] it made more and more sense with to me
[17:50] over time. Of course, there are still
[17:52] aspects of it that I don't understand,
[17:53] aspects of mining that I don't do not
[17:56] understand. What were the strangest
[17:58] things in Bitcoin when you encountered
[18:01] it for you?
[18:03] Self- custody was completely new to me.
[18:06] I never was able with anything where I
[18:10] can put my financial energy and actually
[18:13] have it myself. Before I had stock
[18:16] brokers, I had a bank account, I had all
[18:19] those other things. And there are things
[18:21] like real estate. A lot of people say,
[18:23] "Oh, like I can own my real estate." No,
[18:25] you own a paper that says that you are
[18:29] allowed to live there or rent it out and
[18:30] stuff like that. But it can be taken
[18:33] away from you really easily. There has
[18:36] to be just one judge saying, "Oh, it's
[18:37] not your home anymore." And if you don't
[18:40] agree, there's policemen coming to your
[18:42] house and get you out there. So, you
[18:45] don't really own your home. You don't
[18:48] really own any stocks. You don't really
[18:50] own anything other than Bitcoin because
[18:53] Bitcoin is the only thing that you can
[18:54] store in your head. And they cannot even
[18:57] get it out by force. They cannot they
[19:00] cannot shoot it out of you. if they they
[19:04] they could um uh torture you, but it's
[19:07] still your choice if you give it to them
[19:09] or not. And this concept was so far away
[19:14] from me, so foreign to me that it was
[19:18] really hard for me to to grab
[19:21] how how big of an invention this is for
[19:26] mankind.
[19:28] What will that change if all of a sudden
[19:31] we cannot there's no central authority
[19:35] over over finances over money? You
[19:39] immediately think about war. You
[19:41] immediately think about um breaking in
[19:44] and stealing things. You immediately
[19:46] think about all those things. All of the
[19:48] sudden the
[19:50] responsibility is not at a centralized
[19:54] authority like a bank or government. The
[19:57] responsibility is at the individual
[19:59] level. You you you remove the
[20:03] responsibility from you move the
[20:05] responsibility basically down from the
[20:08] government, from the big banks, from the
[20:10] institutions down to the individual
[20:12] level. And really interesting if that
[20:15] concept is so popular if that comes
[20:19] through all of the internet if it's not
[20:21] just money because right now it's just
[20:24] money where we have that possibility.
[20:27] Yes, you can say with social media we
[20:29] also have nosa but most people are not
[20:33] yet on nosa. I mean you can also make
[20:34] that argument with
[20:36] bitcoin but we really need that concept
[20:40] to go through all of society to take the
[20:43] responsibility back from the big
[20:45] institutions towards the individual.
[20:48] This will be an awesome future. I'm not
[20:52] sure if it happens. I'm sure with
[20:54] Bitcoin that it happens. I'm not sure if
[20:57] the rest of the internet is so
[21:00] passionate about self- custody that they
[21:03] will actually adopt it even though it
[21:06] might mean it's not as convenient as a
[21:09] centralized thing. If we get a
[21:14] self-custodial social media app that's
[21:16] more convenient and has a better network
[21:19] effect than the the centralized ones
[21:21] then they then it wins. I'm not sure if
[21:23] that's the case because with Bitcoin we
[21:25] have an in a financial incentive to
[21:27] adopt it. If there wouldn't be number
[21:31] technology, Bitcoin industry would be
[21:33] like one h 100th of the
[21:38] size. Like if if Bitcoin only would um
[21:42] make transactions secure across borders
[21:47] without the number
[21:49] technology, almost everyone wouldn't be
[21:51] here.
[21:52] I I would never came to Bitcoin. I
[21:56] probably would still not be in Bitcoin.
[21:58] There's people that would be in Bitcoin
[22:00] still also for that. But the number go
[22:02] up technology, the inflation hatch, this
[22:05] is the one thing that gets people in. So
[22:09] we have to figure out how we can how we
[22:12] can have a big enough incentive for
[22:14] social media apps, for all the data
[22:17] apps, for all the other things to have a
[22:19] big incentive for people to take the
[22:24] their control from the institutions down
[22:27] to the individual level. I'm not sure
[22:28] this exists. I'm not sure we come to
[22:30] that future. I'm sure we come to that
[22:32] future in Bitcoin and with money because
[22:35] the incentives are correct. the game
[22:37] theories playing out and that concept
[22:40] was completely new for me and I'm still
[22:43] fascinated by it. I'm still fascinated
[22:45] by nostra also. I'm still fascinated by
[22:48] what implication does it have for
[22:50] society when all of a sudden you have a
[22:54] key and you can lock that key in your
[22:57] brain and nobody can take it away from
[23:00] you. like how how crazy is that that we
[23:03] have that now and what implications does
[23:06] that have on society long term. So that
[23:09] that's that was probably the the biggest
[23:11] thing that I had to wrap my head around
[23:14] it. Of course there were technical
[23:16] challenges but I I jumped over them.
[23:19] There were other things that I uh uh had
[23:22] to to tackle. For example, I thought
[23:25] inflation is good for society. Uh I I
[23:28] really thought like inflation is good to
[23:31] prosper small companies and stuff like
[23:33] that. I couldn't be further away from
[23:35] the truth there. So I had to jump over
[23:38] that hoop and realize that the natural
[23:41] state of the economy is
[23:44] deflationary and inflation means that we
[23:47] are manipulating nature and this is the
[23:51] bad thing.
[23:53] So that was another big hoop and that's
[23:55] probably the the two big things that are
[23:58] really hard to to get. Why is why is it
[24:02] good that we have deflation
[24:05] and oh and how crazy it is that we have
[24:10] the possibility to take your own money
[24:12] in your own hands and nobody can f with
[24:16] it. Yeah, absolutely. And someone who
[24:18] opened my minds mind to it was uh
[24:22] the uh great Jeff Booth. He explained it
[24:27] in very
[24:29] uh
[24:30] comprehensible terms. I listened to him
[24:32] first
[24:34] on who is that guy? I don't remember his
[24:38] name. He had a series and he has
[24:40] interviewed Sailor too and he's very
[24:42] famous. Do you do you buy him? Robert
[24:45] Pedlo. Yes. Yes. Robert B love. Yeah.
[24:47] Yeah. I listened to his series on
[24:49] Robert. I can read your mind. Yeah.
[24:52] Yeah. He read it better better than me.
[24:54] The name wasn't there. The face was
[24:55] there. But you read it. Yeah. So he
[24:59] really opened mind to that. And I think
[25:02] uh I have already said that to you too
[25:04] that the guy who
[25:07] uh killed the last leftist cells in my
[25:10] body was Jeff Booth. So it made me a
[25:13] full free market
[25:15] believer. And one of the interesting
[25:18] things is that even if you consider that
[25:23] everyone is on a bitcoin standard and it
[25:26] has 100% adoption, that's a direction
[25:29] that we I would like to go. There are so
[25:31] many directions I can take from what you
[25:34] just explained. But uh let's go this
[25:37] way. Even if everyone accepts Bitcoin,
[25:40] there is still room for Bitcoin to grow.
[25:42] Why? Because you cannot increase the
[25:45] amount of Bitcoin. And over time, human
[25:47] productivity increases. Entrepreneurs
[25:50] find more productive ways to do things
[25:54] that used to require so much resources
[25:58] and energy and material and they are
[26:01] doing it at a lower cost with a higher
[26:03] efficiency. So the cost will go down
[26:05] over time. So if something cost you one
[26:09] Satoshi on a 100% Bitcoin standard, it's
[26:13] going to cost you one and a half Satoshi
[26:17] one year later because of the thanks to
[26:19] new new innovations. So Bitcoin
[26:21] increasing in value is not just a
[26:24] function of uh increase in the number of
[26:27] people that use it. It is going to be
[26:29] true for a long time because we are now
[26:31] at 2% 4% adoption maybe when what we
[26:35] call adoption is even ex Bitcoin and
[26:37] exchanges which I don't call adoption we
[26:39] are still in the beginning of the way
[26:42] but there's a long way to go and even in
[26:45] that day we are going to have deflation
[26:47] rather than inflation and nobody can
[26:50] open your eyes to that idea better than
[26:52] Jeff Booth and I'm thinking of bringing
[26:54] him on hopefully about Bitcoin hyper
[26:57] bitcoinization What are your thoughts on
[26:59] that? When it's going to going to when
[27:02] it's going to happen or if it's going to
[27:05] ever happen. It's out of question that
[27:08] it will
[27:08] happen. The cat is out of the back. So,
[27:12] it it it is no longer a question if we
[27:14] come to a Bitcoin world. It's it's a
[27:17] question of how fast we will get there,
[27:20] how violent or peaceful we will get
[27:22] there and and how will the way to that
[27:26] future will look like. There's no
[27:29] question in mind that the future
[27:31] monetary standard is a sound monetary
[27:35] standard. That there's there's
[27:36] absolutely no question in my mind for
[27:38] that. And there's also no question that
[27:42] I think the real adoption of of Bitcoin
[27:45] is not at two, three, four, 5%. It's
[27:48] probably under 1%. Because those people
[27:51] who now have Bitcoin, only a handful of
[27:55] those actually live on a Bitcoin
[27:57] standard.
[27:59] A lot of people counted in the three,
[28:01] four, 5% adoption, they have a€,000
[28:04] euros, maybe 5,000 euros on
[28:07] Coinbase and they have a €100,000
[28:10] portfolio somewhere else that they
[28:13] didn't adopt Bitcoin standard. They are
[28:16] diversifying their portfolio a little
[28:18] bit. So I wouldn't count them in the
[28:21] statistics of they adopted a Bitcoin
[28:23] standard. If we raise the standard of
[28:27] what it what it is that it is that you
[28:30] have a bitcoin standard I think we are
[28:33] way down and we have like 0.1 uh 0.5%
[28:37] adoption something very something
[28:39] ridiculously low. If you ask um like if
[28:43] you go about and say like and you
[28:45] interview the whole world let's say you
[28:47] interview the whole world and you ask
[28:49] everyone a set of questions and first
[28:52] everyone stands up and uh everyone is
[28:55] standing and you ask the question please
[28:57] sit down if you have some exposure to
[29:01] bitcoin 97% of the room would sit down
[29:05] because around we are at around 3%
[29:07] adoption let's say then if you ask the
[29:10] question. Okay, who holds their own
[29:14] keys? Another 97% of that 3% is sitting
[29:18] down. Then you ask the question, who has
[29:22] more than 80% let's say uh more
[29:25] conservative, who has more than 50% of
[29:27] their net worth of their liquid net
[29:30] worth in Bitcoin? So not counting your
[29:33] own home, not counting anything else
[29:34] like just your liquid net worth like
[29:37] another 50% are sitting down. So that's
[29:40] what I mean with we are at under 1%
[29:44] adoption. I'm I'm quite sure about that.
[29:46] What does this mean then? What what what
[29:50] does this mean? If you're sure about
[29:52] that we are under 1% adoption and you're
[29:54] sure about that we reach a sound many
[29:56] standard this means we probably have a
[29:59] 200x from here. what Bitcoin can do.
[30:02] This means that we have this means we're
[30:05] so freaking early that you that if you
[30:10] tell this to people that are not
[30:12] Bitcoiners, they think you're crazy. And
[30:15] it's the crazy ones that change the
[30:18] world. I think Steve Jobs said said that
[30:21] once. it. It's the crazy ones that think
[30:24] so far ahead and think about so crazy
[30:26] ideas that other
[30:28] people don't even want to listen to you
[30:31] because it's so far-fetched. So, I'm
[30:33] also recommending if you talk to people
[30:36] outside of of Bitcoin, don't tell them
[30:39] that Bitcoin will 200x because they will
[30:42] see the $100,000 price and they like,
[30:44] "Okay, let's 2x that. That is 200,000.
[30:48] Let's put a zero behind it. That's 2
[30:50] million. Let's put another zero band.
[30:52] It's 20 million. No way. Bitcoin is
[30:54] going to 20 million. Yes, it's going to
[30:56] 20 million. It's going to 50 million.
[30:57] It's going to 200 million because the US
[31:00] dollar and the euro and all the rest of
[31:02] the field will some at some point be
[31:05] worthless against Bitcoin. So, we'll
[31:08] reach all the price points from 100,000
[31:12] to infinity. Like everyone uh like a
[31:16] Satoshi can be worth $1 billion. it
[31:20] won't be measured in that way because if
[31:22] a Satoshi is1 billion dollars, nobody
[31:24] cares about the dollars anymore. So the
[31:27] the point is we are so early in that
[31:31] game. We are so early in the adoption
[31:34] that people have a hard time figuring
[31:38] out how this will change the world. And
[31:41] that's that's what I'm trying to do. I'm
[31:44] 100% sure that we will get there. I'm
[31:46] 100% sure that it's the right move to be
[31:49] allin in this community and I'm just now
[31:53] figuring out how we will actually get to
[31:56] that future. And I'm looking at the
[31:59] history right now. I'm looking at the
[32:01] printing press, the steam engine, the
[32:05] electricity, the uh electronic
[32:08] telegraph, the transistor, the internet
[32:11] uh technology, like all those historical
[32:14] examples and see how did they change so
[32:18] society and what impact Bitcoin will
[32:22] have onto our society. If you look for
[32:25] example at something very easy uh what
[32:29] is very easy to understand also it was
[32:32] very very easy also for me to understand
[32:33] when I first heard it the printing press
[32:37] is also very famous in in my opinion in
[32:40] within Bitcoin before the printing press
[32:43] most people couldn't read most people um
[32:46] couldn't write and those people who
[32:48] could controlled how information spread
[32:52] because those were the only people that
[32:54] spread credit information. Then there
[32:56] were also people that read out loud on
[32:59] the sessions. So they controlled also
[33:01] what's being said and what's being uh
[33:04] delivered. Then there were the church
[33:06] and they basically had a monopoly on
[33:08] information. And this basically
[33:11] gave a very cru small group of people
[33:15] the the control of how information is
[33:20] processed and how information goes to
[33:22] other people. And the interesting thing
[33:24] now is that it took a long while to make
[33:29] one book. So there's a person that has
[33:32] to sit down and write let's say let's
[33:35] take the Bible because that's what uh
[33:38] Johannes Gutenberg was his first project
[33:40] with with with the Bible. Uh this Bible
[33:43] that he printed had
[33:46] 1,200 and something uh sides. 1,200
[33:50] sides. You have to sit down and write it
[33:54] line by line, page by page. Imagine how
[33:58] long a human being needs to write one of
[34:01] those books. There estimates around a
[34:05] few months, maybe a little bit over a
[34:07] year, how long one human being works on
[34:10] that book. Johannes Gutenberg with his
[34:12] uh invention of the printing press
[34:15] managed in the first five years of his
[34:17] invention to print 180 copies. In that
[34:22] same time frame if he would just write
[34:25] the Bibles he could maybe do like five
[34:30] probably more like two because you also
[34:32] have to write it very nicely. So you
[34:34] have to to to make a nice copy. So this
[34:38] already accelerated uh innovation a lot.
[34:42] But the more interesting thing is what
[34:45] happened over the next 50 years. Like
[34:49] who cares about the fast first five
[34:50] years? It's just like small innovation
[34:52] is like sparking a little bit. That's
[34:54] what we are seeing now with Bitcoin. But
[34:56] over the next 50 years only in Europe
[35:00] there were over 20 million books.
[35:03] We we went from one book takes around a
[35:07] year to 20 million books in 50 years and
[35:13] I don't even know how many books we are
[35:15] now producing on a daily basis probably
[35:17] like a million per day or something like
[35:19] that with all the ebooks and the small
[35:21] things. And this made people realize
[35:23] they have to read, they have to write.
[35:25] This uh um enabled a lot of uh
[35:28] revolutions. This enabled innovation.
[35:30] This enabled all all sorts of other
[35:34] things. And then you come back to
[35:36] Bitcoin. What if we don't fix uh
[35:40] knowledge like the printing press fixed
[35:43] knowledge? What if we fix money? What if
[35:46] we fix the most fundamental thing of our
[35:49] lives? The thing that we all use, there
[35:53] are people that never read a book. Like
[35:55] there are people like that, but there
[35:58] are rarely people that
[35:59] never touched money. Like most people
[36:03] have touched money in some sort of
[36:05] sense. If if I would now if if let's say
[36:08] there are uh let's say there's an full
[36:10] Austrian audience like and we we ask
[36:13] everyone in
[36:15] Austria who here has touched
[36:18] money like most of them would say yeah
[36:21] of course I touch money even even if you
[36:25] uh even if you live on the street you
[36:27] probably have inducted with some sort of
[36:29] money at some point. So this is
[36:33] something that touches every human being
[36:35] on earth and every human being on earth
[36:38] needs that like every human being on
[36:41] earth needs Bitcoin. How gigantic that
[36:44] opportunity is and how gigantic the
[36:48] impact on society is is really hard to
[36:51] grasp. And uh that's what I'm currently
[36:54] doing with with my book. That's what I'm
[36:56] trying to figure out. What can we learn
[36:59] from the past combining with the
[37:01] knowledge we have already on Bitcoin and
[37:04] how this will impact society? Like I
[37:06] have I have no clue. I've not come to a
[37:08] a conclusion yet. But it's just uh uh
[37:12] that's what I'm really um passionate
[37:14] about right now. And I forgot actually
[37:17] your initial question. I was going on
[37:19] for so long that I forgot what what you
[37:21] were actually asking. Um but I hope uh I
[37:24] kind of answered it. Let's take a break
[37:27] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[37:30] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[37:33] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[37:36] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[37:39] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[37:42] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[37:44] completely new and amazing Genesis
[37:47] edition of their watch collections. You
[37:50] have the date of the first ever mined
[37:53] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[37:55] also the block height and which epoch we
[37:58] are currently in. I love the level of
[38:01] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[38:04] Make sure to check out those amazing
[38:06] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[38:09] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[38:12] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[38:15] really do hope that you don't have it on
[38:17] exchange. But if you do have it on
[38:19] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[38:21] deal with that. The first way is you put
[38:23] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[38:25] entry for you to get into the
[38:28] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[38:31] Bitcoin only edition. For that, it's a
[38:34] super simple and secure way. And if you
[38:36] check out the link in the description,
[38:38] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[38:42] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[38:44] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[38:48] partner in terms of how to get the most
[38:51] out of your sovereignty. They will
[38:53] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[38:56] that is perfect for your individual
[38:59] situation. They will show you how you
[39:01] can secure your own devices. Securing
[39:04] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[39:06] have to keep all your devices secure.
[39:08] One topic that is overlooked often is
[39:11] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[39:14] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[39:16] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[39:19] place already? And last but not least,
[39:21] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[39:23] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[39:25] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[39:31] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[39:33] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[39:36] be for the first time ever speaking at
[39:39] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[39:41] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[39:44] really looking forward to seeing all of
[39:46] you there. You can get your ticket in
[39:48] the link down in the description of
[39:51] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[39:53] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[39:57] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[39:58] there. Yeah. Yeah. I I was asking the
[40:01] future of Bitcoin how it is going to be
[40:03] on hyper bitcoinization. and you said
[40:05] yeah actually it was totally answered
[40:07] with some extra points and as a kind of
[40:10] quick digression uh we are going to
[40:13] answer this question from the our
[40:15] audience radar BTC maybe 80% of
[40:17] bitcoiners bitcoin users will never hold
[40:20] their own keys and that's fine even if
[40:22] they hold JPM JP Morgan tokens 25%
[40:26] backed by onchain verified BTC that's
[40:29] good what is your opinion on that after
[40:31] this we will continue our discussion
[40:33] about the future of bitcoin
[40:35] I I do think so. Actually, I I'm I'm
[40:38] still a little bit I'm I'm not 100% sure
[40:42] on that topic, but I have a hard time
[40:46] thinking that everyone will hold their
[40:49] own keys and it will be natural, at
[40:51] least in the medium term. There might be
[40:53] a long-term future where let's come back
[40:57] to the book
[40:58] example. The invention of the printing
[41:01] press forced people to learn how to read
[41:04] and write and maybe just maybe Bitcoin
[41:09] forces people to take
[41:12] responsibility to forces people to learn
[41:16] about public private key management.
[41:20] That's my hopeful answer. That's my
[41:24] optimistic answer. But this will take a
[41:28] very long time. Just as it did with the
[41:30] printing press. It was not within like
[41:32] oh we invention we invented the printing
[41:35] press 5 years later everyone can read
[41:37] and write. No still today there are a
[41:41] lot of people on the earth that cannot
[41:42] read and write. Even in uh uh progressed
[41:46] societies, in developed societies, there
[41:49] are a lot of people that still cannot
[41:50] read and write. Even in Austria and even
[41:52] in the western society, there are still
[41:54] people they cannot read and write. But
[41:56] it is mainstream like you can write, I
[41:59] can write, you can read, I can read. Um
[42:02] and most of the audience probably can
[42:04] read and write. So what we have actually
[42:06] come to know when we look at the history
[42:10] inventions forces us to think and behave
[42:14] differently and what if for
[42:17] example big companies all of a sudden
[42:20] discover self-custody and I talked
[42:23] actually about that with Michael Sailor
[42:24] on my podcast. What if Apple encounters
[42:28] Bitcoin self-custody? What if Apple
[42:30] comes in and says, "We want to be the
[42:34] hardware wallet providers for all of you
[42:37] because we think Bitcoin is the future."
[42:39] And all of a sudden, your iPhone is a
[42:43] key, your Apple Watch is a key, your
[42:46] MacBook is a key, your iPad is a key,
[42:50] your uh Siri device, this HomePod thing
[42:54] is a key. And if you hold three of your
[42:58] let's say six Apple devices that you
[43:00] have together, you can sign a
[43:03] transaction offline and the signing
[43:07] thing happens on uh on the device
[43:12] offline right in a hardware wallet. Like
[43:14] the treasure is built into the Apple
[43:17] iPhone. I don't know. I'm not predicting
[43:20] that this will happen. I'm just saying
[43:22] there's a lot of uh things that can
[43:25] happen and the bit key for example um is
[43:28] a super is a great example of how
[43:33] future self custody could look like
[43:36] that's very easy for everyone to use
[43:39] because yes we we know bit key if you're
[43:42] really fully self-s sovereign and you
[43:44] want to get in your own hands I
[43:46] personally don't use a bit key you have
[43:49] different solutions
[43:51] But this is a solution that I can give
[43:53] to my granddad and he he can figure out
[43:57] the phone, he can figure out the bit
[43:59] key. And if he can figure out
[44:02] that, we probably come up with even
[44:05] easier things to do. And key management
[44:08] might be something very easy in the
[44:11] future where you just have to choose how
[44:15] sovereign you want to go. So you have
[44:18] different solutions where um maybe an an
[44:23] an iPhone and your Apple Watch together
[44:26] is a key and you need both of them uh
[44:30] additionally with your a MacBook uh to
[44:33] to have a two out of three multisc setup
[44:36] and two out of if you hold two together
[44:39] you can sign a transaction. That's
[44:41] probably not not the most secure, but
[44:43] it's a nice easy solution and it will be
[44:46] amazing in the Apple
[44:48] ecosystem. But then if you really want
[44:50] to be fully so on, you only uh use
[44:54] opensource hardware and software where
[44:57] you can verify everything yourself.
[45:00] Everything
[45:01] is oh gosh, how is that word called?
[45:04] Airgapped. Everything is airgapped. So
[45:06] you don't uh connect it to your online
[45:08] device. you don't connect like you can
[45:10] go way more sovereign with it but not
[45:14] everyone will be on the most sovereign
[45:17] act uh most sovereign end of the
[45:20] spectrum some will be at the Apple level
[45:24] some might even have a bitcoin wallet uh
[45:27] on and at the bitcoin bank that there be
[45:30] there will be bitcoin custodians that
[45:32] that will be around how big the
[45:35] percentage will be from how many people
[45:39] have their own keys versus how many
[45:40] people give someone else the keys to
[45:43] keep them will be determined by how
[45:47] necessary it is to keep your own keys.
[45:50] How much trust in this is in this
[45:52] institutions but also it will be
[45:55] determined by how convenient is it to
[45:59] hold your own
[46:00] keys and what's the tradeoff there. So I
[46:04] cannot tell you all the answers here but
[46:07] I this is how I think um big picture how
[46:11] self- custody will scale in the future.
[46:14] Yeah. And we are already we already have
[46:16] solutions that uh optimize self custody.
[46:19] For example, you can uh have something
[46:23] like uh
[46:26] uh Swan Bitcoin. I think they hold one
[46:28] key. Is that is it them or is it someone
[46:31] else? And then uh you hold two out of
[46:36] three signatures. So you always can sign
[46:39] if you lose one of your keys. It's not
[46:40] the end of the world. Uh at 21st
[46:42] Capital, my friends work on uh the smart
[46:46] wault uh where if you lose one of your
[46:49] keys after determined time and the
[46:52] number which is calculated in terms of
[46:54] the block time, you're going to have
[46:57] access to your Bitcoin with only one
[46:59] key. That's an interesting thing. So
[47:03] there are things that making it
[47:05] more kind of affordable and accessible
[47:09] to all kinds of people. So maybe there
[47:11] will be no necessity for people to even
[47:14] uh hold their Bitcoin on exchanges as it
[47:17] is not now. Maybe people are just
[47:20] scared. I think that is one of the big
[47:22] reasons. I remember my Francina
[47:26] um did a research. I have forgotten the
[47:30] detail details of that. But yeah, so one
[47:33] of the one of
[47:35] the uh hindrances is that people are
[47:38] afraid of using losing storing their own
[47:41] keys because they might uh mess up
[47:44] something. So when it become when these
[47:46] concerns are addressed then there is
[47:48] less incentive for people to not hold
[47:52] their keys. And here I am curious
[47:55] without
[47:57] um disclosing any of your
[48:01] uh private ways of
[48:03] self-custody how your self-custody has
[48:05] evolved and what has become possible in
[48:10] your Bitcoin lifetime. For example, when
[48:12] I came into Bitcoin, there were light
[48:15] wallets such such as Electum. Electum
[48:17] Electum was my first Bitcoin wallet. I
[48:21] have this nostalgic love for it all the
[48:23] time. Though these days I use Sparrow
[48:26] more on my system than Electrom. I
[48:29] always have Electron installed somewhere
[48:31] but uh mostly I use Sparrow. I use Blue
[48:35] Wallet. Mobile wallets were not to be
[48:37] trusted were not much of a thing. I mean
[48:40] you could install electron there but
[48:42] maybe not the best idea. Uh things have
[48:46] changed a lot since then. Light
[48:48] lightning wallets came, taproot uh came
[48:51] in, miniscripts came in since I've come
[48:55] to bitcoin. Uh and then
[48:59] from an electron wallet uh whose seed
[49:04] phrases I wrote in my keypass, I just
[49:07] wrote it simply there. So it was just a
[49:11] matter of luck that I didn't get hacked
[49:13] with all the kinds of hacks that people
[49:15] see. So when we are talking about people
[49:18] getting hacked, we are not looking down
[49:20] on them. I have made all the mistakes
[49:22] under the sun uh and sometimes I am
[49:25] talking of experience and now I am
[49:29] relying on hardware wallets. The
[49:31] hardware wallets that you make yourself
[49:32] flashing your own uh hardware wallet.
[49:35] one of my one of the favorite guests
[49:37] that we talked on 21st Capital and I'm
[49:40] looking forward to bring him on here was
[49:42] the uh creator of Seed
[49:45] Signer. Uh so I have created my own
[49:49] wallet just for
[49:50] fun. Of course, there are many scripts
[49:53] that I have played around with and I
[49:56] want to know without revealing your
[49:58] private key or your seed phrase or
[50:01] saying exactly where your keys are
[50:03] located or which setup you're using,
[50:05] could you tell us how it's evolved or uh
[50:09] yeah, tell us something about that and
[50:12] what do you think the future of the
[50:14] Bitcoin will be and some part of it I
[50:17] can say I got from the previous uh
[50:19] description that you provided. So I want
[50:22] to see how your interaction with Bitcoin
[50:24] has evolved in terms of self custody.
[50:28] Um I stay a little bit general with that
[50:32] and and and put put also experience that
[50:36] I've seen from other Bitcoiners in
[50:37] there. The the really interesting thing
[50:39] with with Bitcoin is the the the moment
[50:43] you come into Bitcoin, you first have to
[50:47] discover self custody at all. So you
[50:49] first have to see that there is
[50:51] something like self-custod
[50:54] um having your own keys. As I talked
[50:56] before this was a big moment for me
[50:58] where before I always trusted
[51:01] institutions. I just had a stock
[51:04] brokerage where I had my stocks. I had a
[51:06] bank where I had my money and all that
[51:08] was fine. But then all of a sudden you
[51:10] come to know like oh I can I can have my
[51:15] Bitcoin
[51:16] myself. So self-custody starts at the
[51:20] realization that you can self-custody
[51:22] your Bitcoin. Most Bitcoiners haven't
[51:25] come to that conclusion. If you do self
[51:27] custody, you are ahead of 97% of all
[51:31] Bitcoiners already. Even if you have a
[51:33] shitty self-custody setup, you're
[51:35] already be uh in in front of you're
[51:38] already in the top 3%. So in the top 3%
[51:41] we have then uh the people that self
[51:44] custody and then at some point you go
[51:46] through attack vectors of like oh I have
[51:49] maybe I'm just laying around here
[51:51] because they are partner of mine bit box
[51:54] you have one hardware hardware key and
[51:58] there you have all all the things on and
[52:00] then you go through the things of like
[52:02] oh but what if it
[52:04] breaks? Oh yeah, it might be uh good to
[52:08] have a metal seat backup. It might be
[52:10] good to have some backup of of your
[52:13] hardware wallet. Yeah, but okay, I have
[52:16] this metal backup. I have it laying
[52:17] around at home. What if someone comes
[52:20] and looks at it or makes a a picture
[52:22] like maybe a friend or maybe I don't
[52:25] know some some friend of someone else's
[52:27] friend and he sees it on like oh like
[52:29] free bitcoin right there and she snaps a
[52:32] picture puts the 12 words 24 words in in
[52:35] let's say you set a blue wallet and just
[52:37] snaps your bitcoin out. So you have to
[52:39] protect against that also. Then what if
[52:43] my house burns down and everything is
[52:47] gone? Like even your metal, I know they
[52:49] are fire resistant and stuff like that,
[52:51] but maybe you don't find it. Maybe maybe
[52:55] you're living in an apartment building
[52:56] where everything crashes down. Good luck
[52:59] finding that one thing that survived in
[53:02] that fire under a huge
[53:06] uh thing. So what if that happens? Then
[53:10] you go all of the sudden in in multi
[53:11] signature uh and say like, okay, I could
[53:14] have a key uh at a bank. I could have a
[53:17] key at a friend's place. I could have a
[53:19] key at my parents place. I could have a
[53:21] key at my daughter's place. I could have
[53:24] a key wherever I want to have my key. So
[53:27] then you're like, okay, what do I do?
[53:30] Two out of three. Uh three out of six.
[53:33] Two out of five. Three out of five. Like
[53:35] that like 10 out of 20. You can go crazy
[53:38] with it. I don't know if there's any
[53:40] limit actually with it. I never
[53:42] researched that. But there are a lot of
[53:43] possibilities that you can do.
[53:46] So then you come to the conclusion,
[53:49] okay, do I want to trust this person? Do
[53:51] I want to trust this person? Uh what if
[53:54] they mess it up? What if I have a three
[53:57] out of five and I have let's say two
[54:00] keys at home, one key at the bank? If
[54:03] the bank loses it and uh my my people
[54:08] also um mess it up, all of the sudden
[54:10] I'm only having two keys and I cannot
[54:13] control my my Bitcoin anymore. So those
[54:16] people should also not work together
[54:18] against you. Then uh you have things
[54:22] like miniscripts. Now I think 21st
[54:24] Capital is is one of the first that that
[54:26] actually does that and implements that
[54:28] which makes keys available after certain
[54:32] amount of time which is an amazing
[54:33] invention.
[54:35] So what I wanted to want to say with
[54:38] that is there's a natural evolution the
[54:42] more you learn about Bitcoin and the
[54:45] more money you get into Bitcoin with
[54:48] what setup you have and maybe over time
[54:51] you have from single key to multi-key
[54:54] from multi key to multi- vendor uh
[54:58] setup. So you not only have one setup,
[55:02] you have multiple setups at in with
[55:05] multiple different uh vendors. Maybe you
[55:08] have a wallet with 21st Capital. Maybe
[55:11] you have a wallet with Kaza. Maybe you
[55:13] have a wallet uh yourself where you do
[55:15] self custody multisig completely
[55:17] yourself without any vendors. Um maybe
[55:20] you have it with some other um service
[55:23] providers. So there are so many
[55:26] different options that you can go down
[55:29] that you could actually do that it's
[55:33] only important that you look at what can
[55:37] happen to you and how can you secure
[55:40] yourself against that. How can you make
[55:43] sure that if
[55:45] someone Yeah, there's one thing that
[55:48] I've not discussed yet. The the $5 range
[55:50] attack. What if someone actually knows
[55:52] about your Bitcoin, comes at your home
[55:55] and is threatening to torture you? Do
[55:57] you have something in place for that? Do
[56:00] you have something in place for whatever
[56:02] can happen to you? So, you have to think
[56:05] about all the different attack
[56:07] vectors and how you can protect yourself
[56:10] against every single one of that. And
[56:13] with security, and you probably know
[56:14] that uh better than I do, with security,
[56:17] there's never a 100% secure system.
[56:22] There's always this one small
[56:25] possibility that can go
[56:27] wrong. But make that one small
[56:30] possibility so
[56:32] unlikely that it would
[56:34] be a headline story
[56:37] everywhere if it actually happens. So
[56:40] you can make money with with that
[56:41] headline story.
[56:45] Yeah, that was a good way of putting it,
[56:47] Connie. Yeah. And it is important to
[56:50] diversifiy when it comes to Bitcoin, but
[56:52] not diversify your money in real estate,
[56:55] some crypto, shedcoins, and also
[56:57] bitcoin, but your bitcoin in different
[56:59] setups. Uh it's not necessary for
[57:02] everyone. Uh you and I talk about
[57:04] bitcoin. People know our name. So our
[57:06] situation is different from others. But
[57:08] if anyone wants to come after me, I lost
[57:10] all my Bitcoin in a voting accident. So,
[57:13] you're not going to get anything.
[57:15] Um, every person based on the amount of
[57:19] money they have and the situation they
[57:21] have, they require different self
[57:23] custody solutions. Uh, one of our
[57:26] audience here said, we'll quickly read
[57:29] this comment. The forcing function for
[57:31] mass adoption might be this that
[57:33] survival requires sovereignty. That's
[57:36] scary. I tend to agree with that. And uh
[57:39] what are your thoughts on that? So we
[57:42] can go to another other I love that. Uh
[57:45] a man that that sentence hits hard. I
[57:48] never heard that sentence in in uh that
[57:51] nicely. I I I might just I might just
[57:54] put that sentence in in my book somehow.
[57:57] That that is really that's really nice
[58:00] because it it
[58:02] shows like the first thing is like the
[58:05] forcing function of mass adoption might
[58:07] be that survival requires
[58:10] sovereignty. So this is not only of like
[58:14] okay it's innovatable that we come to
[58:16] the Bitcoin future but it also shows you
[58:19] have to be prepared to be in that
[58:22] Bitcoin future. Let's take it to an
[58:25] example that most people know about.
[58:26] Let's say the internet. The internet was
[58:29] something where a lot of people
[58:31] benefited a lot. Like a few people, h
[58:35] maybe not a lot, a few people benefited
[58:37] a lot from the internet. Most people
[58:41] benefited not that much from the
[58:43] internet, but everyone benefited somehow
[58:46] from the internet. So like all our lives
[58:48] are a little bit better because of the
[58:50] internet I would say because you can
[58:52] communicate now with friends across the
[58:54] sea and and stuff like that. There all
[58:56] of this there are of course also very
[58:58] negative things with it but we have to
[59:00] adopt and be as sovereign as possible
[59:04] with Bitcoin to be protected and to be
[59:08] as best equipped as possible in a new
[59:11] Bitcoin way. Because what if you have
[59:15] your Bitcoin on an exchange, they get
[59:17] hacked and you never get it back. Yeah,
[59:20] you got that Bitcoin is really good and
[59:23] you got that Bitcoin is is going far,
[59:26] but you never got Bitcoin because you
[59:29] lost them. So like like why did you
[59:32] learn about Bitcoin if you lose them?
[59:33] Like that that does not make sense. So
[59:36] uh yeah, I love that. I love that
[59:38] sentence. I think I have to note that
[59:40] down and and and uh and basically save
[59:43] it for later because I think I have to
[59:45] think once one two more times around
[59:47] that sentence. It's it's it's really
[59:49] it's a good one. I love that. How who
[59:52] was that? Cesar. Thank you so much for
[59:53] that. Caesar. Yeah, Caesar. Thank you
[59:55] for that comment. And might be Cesar
[59:57] based on the locality.
[60:00] Um and we should really practice
[60:03] sovereignty and we should do it before
[60:06] it becomes absolutely necessary. We need
[60:09] to learn how to use Bitcoin before we
[60:12] have to be use Bitcoin because then we
[60:14] have to learn it in a rush. Maybe the
[60:16] demand raises for it so much that we
[60:19] cannot get enough or we can we end up
[60:22] with a smaller amount. Uh there was this
[60:25] thing that future Paul once said, one of
[60:27] the Bitcoin developers, he said that he
[60:30] referred to this Arkansas Traveler
[60:33] lyrics. I even wrote a long post on it
[60:35] about not on Nostra about
[60:38] it that Arkansas Traveler is a kind of
[60:42] country music which has different
[60:45] versions of lyrics. One of them is this
[60:47] that there's a a traveler and he goes to
[60:51] a fiddler home and they are at a place
[60:56] and the ceiling is leaking
[60:59] um there's a hole in it and it's raining
[61:02] and he says that well it's raining and
[61:06] uh we should fix that and he says that
[61:09] well it is raining we cannot fix it
[61:11] right now it's raining rain raining cats
[61:13] and dogs and he says okay so some other
[61:16] day that it's not raining. Why wouldn't
[61:18] you do that? And he said that it doesn't
[61:21] pour when it's not raining. So, or it
[61:24] doesn't leak when it's pour when it's
[61:26] not pouring. We shouldn't
[61:28] be just feel comfortable that everything
[61:31] is okay. The money in our bank account
[61:34] is not going to just go away. Uh though
[61:39] these conditions are nullified for so
[61:41] many of us, uh some people might not
[61:44] have gotten such wakeup calls but we
[61:47] we'd better be prepared
[61:49] um when uh such things become normal and
[61:54] our sovereignty needs uh requires us to
[61:57] know much more solutions. I love that.
[62:00] Yeah, that and you have to prepare.
[62:03] That's also with of self custody. I
[62:05] think it's an uh an important step.
[62:08] First look at yourself custody setup and
[62:11] then imagine the value of it would be
[62:14] 10x. So let's say you have 80,000. Let's
[62:18] say you have one
[62:19] bitcoin. This one bitcoin is now not
[62:22] even 100k
[62:25] US but it's 10x from that. So it's
[62:28] almost like at a million. Would you
[62:31] would you still be comfortable with your
[62:33] self-c setup if it Bitcoin 10xes
[62:38] tomorrow? And that's where a lot of
[62:42] people actually say like, "Oh, 10x's
[62:45] tomorrow. I I might I might have to
[62:47] upgrade the one or two things that
[62:49] myself cussed the setup." And being
[62:51] prepared for that is very important. And
[62:55] um I talked with I talked with Rick
[62:58] actually he now joined the Bitcoin way
[63:00] um uh who lost 25 bitcoin uh you know a
[63:04] bit like Rick Massid and and he he told
[63:07] me at the end of the podcast where I
[63:09] interviewed him around his loss of 25
[63:12] bitcoins I I interviewed him and he said
[63:14] invest in proper bitcoin self custody
[63:18] before you get hilariously rich like
[63:21] make that investment a little bit before
[63:24] that obviously if you
[63:27] have if you have now €3,000 in Bitcoin,
[63:31] don't invest in a hardware setup that
[63:33] cost you like 2,000. That that does not
[63:36] make sense. But if you have, let's say,
[63:40] 200,000 in in Bitcoin, it does make a
[63:44] sense to to invest €2,000 uh in into
[63:48] self asset setup that that really works.
[63:50] And you can make it with partners, you
[63:53] can make it yourself, you can invest
[63:54] either in education or you can invest in
[63:56] a in a provider. So there's a lot of
[63:58] different ways you can go about it. And
[64:00] there's for everyone basically an and an
[64:02] an an offer out there which is amazing
[64:05] to see that the Bitcoin SE customer
[64:06] space is already so big and diverse. So
[64:10] there's no excuses and if you lose your
[64:12] Bitcoin, it's it's totally
[64:14] un I always have a big empathy for
[64:17] people that lose Bitcoin.
[64:20] But at the end of the day, it was their
[64:22] fault. Yeah. And the more realistic
[64:24] people
[64:25] um really accept this no matter how
[64:29] difficult it is. We had
[64:32] um Chos on our show who who is an MMA
[64:37] fighter, jiu-jitsu fighter, and fitness
[64:40] instructor. And he lost nearly one
[64:43] bitcoin and his goal was to become a
[64:45] whole coiner. And he was very clear
[64:49] about the fact that I accept all the
[64:52] responsibility. My friend told me this.
[64:54] My friend told me that. And it is not
[64:56] and we interviewed him not long after
[64:59] this has happened. For most people it
[65:01] would take maybe a year or two to accept
[65:04] the
[65:05] responsibility. But he
[65:08] had he had hit that kind of maturity to
[65:10] say that yeah it was not Bitcoin's
[65:12] fault. It was my fault. It was not my
[65:15] friend's fault. It was my fault. And
[65:16] that's a a huge
[65:18] realization. What is your uh
[65:22] responsibility? my responsibility.
[65:24] People who talk about Bitcoin, educate
[65:26] about Bitcoin and Bitcoin developers,
[65:30] what do you think our role is in uh
[65:34] making the future be in the most
[65:37] peaceful way and most people can benefit
[65:40] from Bitcoin this as soon as possible
[65:43] rather
[65:44] than later. What are our rules? There
[65:47] are three things that are really
[65:49] important. The first thing is stay 100%
[65:53] true to yourself.
[65:55] Like never do
[65:57] anything
[65:59] that like always act as 100 million
[66:03] people are watching. Like imagine your
[66:06] life as you would be on a 24/7 live
[66:10] stream with 100 million people watching
[66:12] you right now. For a lot of people that
[66:14] would be frightening. Most people would
[66:16] uh fall under the pressure. But it just
[66:19] like gives you the feeling of if I do
[66:23] that is that actually an an honorable
[66:26] and integger step that I could take.
[66:30] This is just uh on like stay true to
[66:32] yourself and stay true to your mission.
[66:35] The second thing is if you're an
[66:37] educator in the space, you have the
[66:41] responsibility to educate yourself. You
[66:45] can only educate what you learned
[66:47] before. You can only be as smart as your
[66:51] smartest thought in your brain. And how
[66:54] do smarter thoughts come in your brain?
[66:57] You don't wait till they come in there.
[66:59] You have to study. You have to listen to
[67:01] podcast. You have to listen to
[67:02] audiobooks. You have to read articles.
[67:04] You have to study. You have to sort your
[67:07] things in your brain. And this is this
[67:10] is really
[67:11] important. do bring things in your brain
[67:15] and educate yourself. And as an
[67:17] educator, it's also very important the
[67:20] third step. The third step is
[67:22] then okay, you stay true to yourself.
[67:25] You really get more and more information
[67:28] in your head. But then the third step is
[67:32] learning how to put it in a way that
[67:35] makes sense to make your information,
[67:39] your education that you got into
[67:42] yourself in a great way, in a valuable
[67:45] piece out there. If you're now, let's
[67:48] say, a Tik Tocker, put it out there in
[67:50] like a 30-cond format that makes sense
[67:53] and Orange people. If you're a book
[67:55] author, make it in a great book that
[67:58] really uh brings home the thing. If you
[68:00] are a podcaster, put it in a podcast.
[68:03] What what whatever whatever way of
[68:06] educating you
[68:08] have, you have to bring it in a perfect
[68:12] terms, perfect analogies, perfect
[68:15] speaking skills, the things that is in
[68:18] your brain. I met so many people that
[68:22] know so much about Bitcoin and are so
[68:24] clever, but they never learned how to
[68:27] get their knowledge in a great way out
[68:31] to the world. And that's why they are
[68:33] not good educators. They are probably
[68:36] more they they're smarter than most
[68:40] educators, but they cannot get it out of
[68:42] their brain in a very good way. So other
[68:45] people also understand it. So that's the
[68:47] those are the three jobs in my opinion
[68:50] that an educator has to do. They have to
[68:52] stay true to themsel at all times. They
[68:55] have to educate themsel all the times.
[68:58] you can you cannot make and that what
[69:02] that's what's bothering me a lot with
[69:04] the education system in general because
[69:07] I feel like the teachers learn something
[69:11] once and then they teach it for 50 years
[69:15] and never relearn it never update their
[69:17] thoughts they they just stay there. So
[69:20] as a podcast host, I invest like one to
[69:24] three hours every day to reading uh
[69:27] books or listening to podcasts just to
[69:30] get information, new inspirations in my
[69:32] head. And it doesn't even have to be
[69:34] directly about Bitcoin. I have so many
[69:38] interesting thoughts when I listen to
[69:40] podcasts outside of Bitcoin that remind
[69:43] me of something Bitcoin and then I write
[69:45] it in my Bitcoin book because I'm like,
[69:46] "Oh, that's so genius."
[69:49] So um just try to broaden your space
[69:54] your perspective in
[69:55] Bitcoin. And then the last job is as you
[69:59] said getting that
[70:01] down being good in speaking not just in
[70:05] the words but also like how you say the
[70:07] words is something I'm working right now
[70:09] very hard on because I don't think I'm a
[70:12] good speaker but I have a lot but I have
[70:15] a lot of potential because I have the
[70:17] audience. I have the podcast now and I
[70:19] want to improve on that and I want to
[70:20] live up to to that uh potential. So
[70:24] learning how to speak in a interesting
[70:28] and educational manner is a very
[70:30] important skill. Awesome. You actually
[70:32] had thought it through completely. I
[70:35] randomly asked this question and uh for
[70:37] the audience uh Robin and I didn't
[70:40] arrange the questions. I just sent him
[70:41] the link half an hour before the
[70:44] interview and yeah, it happened to be a
[70:47] question that you had really thought
[70:49] through that that was an amazing answer.
[70:51] And the third step that you said is
[70:53] something that I daily grapple with as a
[70:57] kind Bitcoin educator. How do I make
[71:00] it in the simplest ter terms that not
[71:04] me, someone with that other background
[71:07] also understands it? Sometime someone
[71:09] with that background also understands it
[71:12] and it's a challenging thing and that's
[71:14] the thing that requires a lot of
[71:15] attention just out of cur
[71:18] curiosity outside
[71:21] bitcoin what other podcast tribute to
[71:25] the guy I'm following I listen a lot to
[71:27] Alex Hormosi uh the uh host of or the
[71:33] monolog most mostly of uh the game which
[71:38] is a podcast about entrepreneurship
[71:41] uh and uh marketing, sales and content
[71:45] produ uh production. What are the other
[71:48] podcasts outside Bitcoin that you listen
[71:51] to? I I have a
[71:54] um I have a unique framework. I think I
[71:57] I don't have a podcast that I always
[71:59] listen to. I when I want to learn
[72:02] something I try to figure out who are
[72:06] the five most important people in an
[72:10] industry. So for example if I go ahead
[72:12] and
[72:14] say I want to learn everything about
[72:16] Bitcoin. I figure out who are the
[72:19] five best people for myself to learn
[72:23] about Bitcoin and those people are for
[72:26] everyone different like let's be
[72:27] completely clear and this is also maybe
[72:29] like one thing that you you just said um
[72:33] figuring out how to form a message for
[72:35] everyone is
[72:37] impossible. So just form a message for
[72:41] one audience group and another one can
[72:44] form a message for another audience
[72:46] group. And that's why we need as many
[72:47] different voices as possible to hit it
[72:50] from all the different angles because
[72:51] one person cannot hit it from all the
[72:53] angles. That that's that's for
[72:55] sure. So there are different people that
[72:58] resonate with different for example I'm
[73:01] a big Michael Sailor fan. I'm a big
[73:03] Cadina Moose fan and uh in the beginning
[73:06] even a big Anthony Pompiano fan. And I
[73:09] have a really good friend of mine who
[73:10] also is a Bitcoiner and he hates all
[73:13] three of them. like it's like really
[73:15] hard for me to even say that word, but
[73:17] like he really is like ah they they're
[73:19] just about economics because he's a
[73:21] really a tech guy. He he likes to listen
[73:23] to the developers of of Bitcoin to the
[73:25] core depths and and really goes deep on
[73:28] the technical level. Um which yeah like
[73:31] day three also cover that but they're
[73:33] more on the economic sides with
[73:34] ciphering about awesome economics and
[73:36] stuff like that.
[73:38] So I have that framework when I want to
[73:41] learn something of let's say oh how how
[73:43] can I improve my speaking skills I go in
[73:46] and say hey YouTube Google chatd all the
[73:50] tools how can I learn about speaking and
[73:53] who are the best people to learn it from
[73:56] and there's a guy who's called Vin Gang
[73:59] Ving something like that I I I don't
[74:01] know his name but I then Google his name
[74:06] and just uh see like three podcasts,
[74:09] four podcasts that he did and listen to
[74:12] them. It's usually like Diary of a CEO.
[74:15] He has really great people on uh I I
[74:18] like uh a lot of different podcasts that
[74:20] just go in uh deeper. For example, for
[74:23] graders, there's Colin and Samir um who
[74:26] make great podcast with creators. They
[74:29] even had Mark Zuckerberg and Mr. Beast
[74:31] on in one episode. That was a really
[74:33] interesting one having Zuckerberg and
[74:35] and Mr. beast in in in one episode, but
[74:38] it was more entertaining and not as
[74:41] uh educational. So I I don't have a
[74:46] daily podcast that I listen to. I have
[74:49] more of when I want to learn. Uh that's
[74:51] that's very important. When I want to
[74:52] learn, I have more like there are five
[74:54] six interesting people that I really
[74:56] enjoy and I want to learn from them. So
[75:00] in Bitcoin for example it could be let's
[75:02] say Michael Sailor Jack Maler Cipher
[75:04] Moose Larry
[75:06] La Alden let's say those are our five
[75:09] people then I just search for different
[75:12] podcasts where they were on and uh if
[75:16] they are interesting enough they usually
[75:18] have a book like Michaela does not have
[75:20] a book not about Bitcoin at least but
[75:23] Larry Le has a book Savina Moose has has
[75:26] a book Lin Alden has has a book they all
[75:29] have books usually. Uh so if I like the
[75:32] podcast then I go ahead and and and go
[75:34] deeper on the book side of things and
[75:36] this is a um a a framework on how to
[75:40] learn things is is really interesting.
[75:43] Figure out who are main people in that
[75:46] industry.
[75:48] listen to podcasts or sometimes he even
[75:50] have own channels like Vin has his own
[75:52] channel and he produces this amazing
[75:54] videos and Alex Emozi is one of the guys
[75:57] that you should listen to if you want to
[75:59] scale a business if if you want to h if
[76:02] you have a business and you struggle
[76:04] with that I think he's he's probably
[76:06] number one like he's so good in that
[76:09] it's so funny because I just listened to
[76:11] him uh before I I talked to you because
[76:13] I had my breakfast and I like to listen
[76:15] to something and he has a new format now
[76:19] where he brings in business owners. Yes.
[76:22] Who have a business that is already
[76:25] making some revenue, but this business
[76:27] had like I don't know 300,000 in revenue
[76:29] and 100,000 in losses. So, made no
[76:32] money. And then he talked about the
[76:35] concept how to get that business up and
[76:38] running in a profitable way. And this is
[76:41] awesome content. Like you can literally
[76:43] learn from someone that does that every
[76:45] day with
[76:46] acquisition.com and does it live with a
[76:49] with a person that is like how ma like
[76:53] I'm so grateful that we are in an era
[76:56] where we can just learn that we can just
[76:59] have access to that. That that is that
[77:02] is unbelievably cool. That I'm so
[77:05] grateful to to have those tools. Um,
[77:09] imagine imagine pre-printing press how
[77:13] hard it was to figure out how to build a
[77:15] business and how easy it is right now.
[77:18] You can start a
[77:20] business from your
[77:22] couch and you only need a laptop for it.
[77:25] Like that that's what you need for a
[77:27] business right now. And this is this is
[77:29] something that really humbles me that we
[77:31] live in those amazing times with
[77:34] Bitcoin, with the internet, with all
[77:36] those cool technologies, with AI. Like
[77:39] my podcast would not have been possible
[77:42] in the same quality and quantity without
[77:45] AI. I'm totally honest with you. Yeah,
[77:49] definitely. So, you said that you have
[77:52] two hours and I was like, yeah, we can I
[77:54] can cover all the questions I have. But
[77:56] out of every discussion that we have so
[77:58] many other things that uh are uh that
[78:01] coming out and I want to uh I I really
[78:04] like to talk all about them about all of
[78:06] them. Um however it's better to uh keep
[78:11] the content as concise as possible so
[78:14] people can uh can consume it easier.
[78:17] Though I believe that for having to kind
[78:22] of discover new aspects of every person,
[78:24] we need to sit down with them and talk
[78:26] in a kind of stressfree uh environment
[78:29] which I'm aiming at uh nurturing on this
[78:33] podcast.
[78:34] uh we covered very good bases and it was
[78:37] a nice coincidence that you also know
[78:39] Alex Formoi and you follow his cont uh
[78:42] content and you know him very well and
[78:45] uh I appreciate your time and I'm
[78:48] looking forward to talking you again so
[78:50] I can cover other things and discover
[78:52] new aspects from your life. Awesome. I
[78:54] would love to come on a second time
[78:56] because I feel like we we just barely
[78:58] got started after what is it 1 hour 40
[79:01] 40 minutes. Definitely. Definitely.
[79:03] That's the way I feel. Thank you. And
[79:05] thanks to everyone who's been with us or
[79:08] listening to this this podcast.
