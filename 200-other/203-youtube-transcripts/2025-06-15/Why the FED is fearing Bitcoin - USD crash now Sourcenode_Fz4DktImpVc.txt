[00:00] this is the most important thing that's
[00:01] happening on the planet right now it's
[00:03] very obvious that I wouldn't want to
[00:05] have my money in bonds also not in
[00:07] anything else that's denominated in
[00:08] dollars to really understand why
[00:10] bitcoin's important you have to
[00:12] understand how the world is functioning
[00:14] today and it's running on this financial
[00:17] apparatus that's headed by the bis and
[00:20] the IMF and the Federal Reserve and
[00:22] these institutions are siphoning the
[00:25] value out of society nothing changed
[00:28] after the' 60s and nothing changed after
[00:30] Occupy Wall Street because nobody saw
[00:33] the Pinnacle of the issue which is the
[00:35] Federal Reserve and their ability to
[00:37] print as much money as they want 99.9%
[00:39] of the world still think oh inflation is
[00:42] good for the economy oh yeah prices go
[00:44] up but it's just because there's a war
[00:46] in Ukraine right now if we don't fix the
[00:48] money we will never fix anything I know
[00:50] it's inherently right because it's
[00:52] anti-communist it's pro- private
[00:53] property and so it just knocks the left
[00:55] out completely it's not even a
[00:57] conspiracy theory the EU is super blue
[00:59] pilled and they're probably quite
[01:00] co-opted also and I would imagine it's
[01:02] very politically unpopular to bring up
[01:08] Bitcoin do you think um it's it's
[01:12] dangerous for someone like me that is gr
[01:15] new like I'm not an OG I I was buying
[01:18] Bitcoin not at like 100 EUR or something
[01:20] like that I came in really late most of
[01:22] my Bitcoin I bought like in
[01:24] 20121 uh so I bought a lot on on the top
[01:27] actually yeah I I don't have a lot of
[01:30] Bitcoin I'm I'm really Bitcoin poor like
[01:32] when when I see all the other people are
[01:34] oh I should have bought earlier but
[01:37] I am still right now here and if we are
[01:40] that early and we we know where Bitcoin
[01:43] is going in the future is that scary
[01:46] like for me or is it scary in general if
[01:48] if you're an outspoken well the first
[01:50] thing I'd say is it took me about five
[01:52] years to realize how early I was like I
[01:54] thought I was late for the first five
[01:56] years I was understanding Bitcoin and I
[01:58] think in a way if you ever had a utxo or
[02:01] know what that is you're early but as
[02:05] far as like public facing people talking
[02:08] about Bitcoin yeah there are risks I
[02:10] mean imagine flying into a country where
[02:15] the government is corrupt any country
[02:18] and um they want your Bitcoin they could
[02:23] feasibly uh do something about that and
[02:27] so yeah I I do imagine in a future where
[02:30] we're going to need security detail um
[02:33] at least during the
[02:34] transition I don't know what that looks
[02:36] like I I think that the number one thing
[02:38] bitcoiners talk about is not if but how
[02:42] and like what the transition looks like
[02:46] so yeah I mean it's not something I
[02:48] worry about because I think it's very
[02:49] important not to like be sort of stewing
[02:53] in fear but um and I'm not going to let
[02:56] it stop me from speaking truth and like
[03:00] getting my message out there so to speak
[03:03] um but I have so far actually I I really
[03:07] was torn about talking
[03:10] publicly at this
[03:12] point I don't care yeah it's it's it's
[03:14] interesting for me because they are
[03:16] like uh like two extremes like there I
[03:19] had podcast guests on who said like oh
[03:22] why why are you hiding B behind and I'm
[03:25] Sor don't mean why you're hiding that
[03:26] and you should get out and you should uh
[03:29] um speak your truth and and be brave but
[03:33] honestly like I respect everyone that
[03:35] that wants to protect themselves and
[03:36] wants to protect their their privacy
[03:38] it's like a a really important thing um
[03:42] and I think it's always important to
[03:44] have the option like do you have the
[03:46] option like oh want I do I want to be
[03:48] public do I want to be known for that uh
[03:51] do I want to share that information or
[03:53] not like I think the the optionality is
[03:55] is is the key here yeah ultimately the
[03:57] conclusion came down to
[04:00] this is the most important thing that's
[04:02] happening on the planet right now and I
[04:05] think I have unique things to say about
[04:07] it so it's worthwhile for me to be
[04:10] public even if that makes me it puts me
[04:13] at some risk uh everything is risk in
[04:16] life and um if we're going to make this
[04:18] happen we do need to be public
[04:20] ultimately the point is we're not doing
[04:23] anything wrong right the system that
[04:26] we're opposing is the one that
[04:28] is committing
[04:31] atrocious genocide all over the planet
[04:34] right and and all this Usery of
[04:37] different countries and individuals that
[04:40] those are the people that should feel
[04:41] the need to hide but we're living in a
[04:43] world that's upside down right now and
[04:46] that's why I've become public because
[04:50] yeah I have nothing to hide that's
[04:52] interesting really really cool um the
[04:54] the the thing that I really wanted to
[04:56] get into when I when I started um was I
[04:59] saw two Artic articles of you um in the
[05:03] preparation that I that I did um the one
[05:05] was about Nostra which I found really
[05:08] interesting uh but the second one where
[05:11] you talked about I only saw the title by
[05:13] the way but the second one I only saw
[05:15] the title uh the title was like
[05:17] something with uh Bitcoin is the first
[05:19] decentralized organization uh which was
[05:22] like oh organization but it has no CEO
[05:25] right what did you do there in the
[05:27] article so first of all I'm only on
[05:29] Noster I've gotten rid of Twitter uh and
[05:32] my mental health has improved
[05:34] dramatically that's what the first
[05:35] article is about the second one is
[05:38] basically a metaphor so something I run
[05:41] into a lot when I'm orange peeling
[05:42] people is people will say oh you know
[05:45] they'll compare Bitcoin to a stock and
[05:48] that irritates bitcoiners a lot of times
[05:50] but what I said in the article is don't
[05:52] let it irritate you use it as a metaphor
[05:55] because if you look at Bitcoin as a
[05:58] company
[06:00] or if you if you look at um Fiat as a
[06:03] company you can make these comparisons
[06:05] that actually tear it apart right it's
[06:07] like it has all this seepage there's
[06:09] lots of theft going on uh the the
[06:11] employees are not engaged you've got
[06:13] like all these metrics that a normal
[06:15] investor would say are really bad the
[06:18] amount of debt versus the amount of
[06:20] income and so if you if you want to make
[06:22] a onetoone
[06:24] comparison it's hard to explain monetary
[06:28] history to a person who's an investor a
[06:31] lot of times but it's not hard to sort
[06:33] of pull the government down to the level
[06:35] of companies and be like look at look at
[06:36] what they're doing like they're running
[06:38] it into the ground it's very obvious
[06:40] that I wouldn't want to have my money in
[06:42] bonds um and then maybe also not in
[06:45] anything else that's denominated in
[06:46] dollars it's also interesting when you
[06:48] look at Bitcoin as a company because
[06:50] it's like it sells itself there's like
[06:53] no no real sales person there that gets
[06:56] paid to do it but everyone gets uh
[06:59] rewarded in doing that because they are
[07:02] actually invested in the company like
[07:04] every employee has stake in it they have
[07:07] no depth at all uh the balance sheet
[07:09] just keeps growing uh and the best thing
[07:13] like in in the Bitcoin as the company is
[07:16] the company itself the product because
[07:18] like the stake of Bitcoin is like the
[07:21] company itself other was other than that
[07:23] Bitcoin doesn't really sell something I
[07:24] mean there are Bitcoin merch stores out
[07:26] there and something like that that could
[07:28] be a product like that but but uh in in
[07:30] general like it's a company that doesn't
[07:32] sell anything right yeah I mean it's uh
[07:35] they're all just metaphors right you
[07:36] can't really fully compare Bitcoin to
[07:39] anything but when I meet somebody like I
[07:41] was at the dog park yesterday and I met
[07:43] this guy who was a very sharp
[07:46] entrepreneur and immediately I thought I
[07:48] want to orange bill this guy I want to
[07:50] plug him into our Network because he's
[07:52] going to add value and every person that
[07:54] you add to the Bitcoin Network adds
[07:56] value for all of us because as you said
[07:58] we're all shareholders in this project
[08:01] and so if there are more goods and
[08:03] services available to purchase in
[08:07] Bitcoin then that adds value right and
[08:11] we're still like as far as uh means of
[08:13] exchange adoption super early most
[08:16] people at least in the US are mostly
[08:18] thinking about Bitcoin as a a store of
[08:21] value I think all around the world
[08:24] almost like there are like of course
[08:25] Nigeria there's El Salvador where it
[08:27] might be a little bit different but I
[08:30] think even there the most people hold it
[08:34] and some like enchange it a little bit
[08:36] um so it's it's way better than here but
[08:39] it's still like in the early days of
[08:41] medium exchange I feel like in the
[08:42] western world like for example in in
[08:44] Austria in America in Europe there's
[08:47] like 0.1% of medium exchange maybe uh
[08:51] and then in in other countries I don't
[08:54] know maybe
[08:55] 10% right right yeah I I mean I still
[08:59] have
[08:59] some concerns about the means of
[09:02] exchange on Bitcoin in general right
[09:04] because even going to bitcoin events
[09:07] sometimes lightning doesn't work like in
[09:08] the US right now we've got a lot of
[09:11] lightning apps have been have withdrawn
[09:13] because of
[09:15] regulations I it doesn't fully function
[09:18] yet as a means of exchange I think we'll
[09:20] get there and there's um collie is
[09:22] working on ecash and E nuts and all
[09:26] these things I don't understand them yet
[09:28] it usually takes me a good like four or
[09:29] five years to really wrap my head around
[09:31] the new developments when they come out
[09:33] I'm I'm pretty conservative actually
[09:35] like even though I'm like 90% in Bitcoin
[09:38] when when lightning came out I was like
[09:39] yeah no don't I don't want to touch that
[09:42] like that's that's uh not self- custody
[09:45] I nah but now I do use it um and it
[09:48] works so I don't know we'll see I I'm
[09:51] very optimistic about the development
[09:53] but like as it exists today we're not
[09:55] ready for full scale adoption uh yeah
[09:59] maybe let's take a step back you said
[10:01] before uh in in a sentence that Bitcoin
[10:04] is the most important thing in the world
[10:06] right now for you uh and that's why you
[10:08] decided to to go public about it why is
[10:11] it why is uh Bitcoin the most important
[10:13] thing I think in order to really
[10:15] understand why Bitcoin is important you
[10:17] have to understand how the world is
[10:19] functioning today and it's running on
[10:22] this financial apparatus that's headed
[10:24] by the bis and the IMF and the Federal
[10:28] Reserve and these institutions are
[10:32] siphoning the value out of society and
[10:35] they're bleeding all the energy out of
[10:40] the people who are putting their energy
[10:42] into that system right so it's like the
[10:44] opposite of what we were saying earlier
[10:46] about plugging somebody in and them
[10:48] sharing the value when when you add
[10:51] value to the dollar
[10:53] system it just it just uh it steals from
[10:57] you basically uh inflation is theft I
[11:00] mean Libertarians will say that taxation
[11:02] is theft and there's certainly an
[11:04] argument for that it is robbery in a way
[11:07] but um for sure inflation is theft we
[11:10] don't have any voting rights over it uh
[11:13] we don't even most people don't know how
[11:16] it works and even our politicians are
[11:18] lying to us about how it works all the
[11:20] time saying that government spending
[11:22] doesn't cause inflation and these things
[11:24] which are mathematically false um and as
[11:28] long as that's going on it's going to
[11:30] make inequality worse and as inequality
[11:32] gets worse that's really bad for mental
[11:34] health outcomes which just goes down the
[11:36] line like it destroys everything in
[11:38] society and you have people on the
[11:40] street can't afford houses you've got
[11:42] Wars in other countries being paid for
[11:44] with inflation that um is totally
[11:47] unnecessary I mean it's we've become in
[11:51] the United States we've become the
[11:52] police of the world and yeah it's a
[11:54] great joke like Amer um Team America
[11:58] great joke but like nothing changed you
[12:01] know and nothing changed after the 60s
[12:04] and nothing changed after Occupy Wall
[12:06] Street because nobody saw the Pinnacle
[12:09] of the issue which is the Federal
[12:11] Reserve and their ability to print as
[12:13] much money as they want that is the the
[12:16] peak of the pyramid at the moment and I
[12:19] think that Bitcoin is our best shot at
[12:22] subverting that in a peaceful way and
[12:25] that's why I think it's the most
[12:26] important thing sometimes I'm wondering
[12:28] why people don't get it like sometimes
[12:30] I'm like it's it's like so obvious once
[12:34] you get it uh beyond the the normal uh
[12:38] bitcoiner crowd uh there is a really big
[12:42] crowd like 99.9% of the world I would
[12:45] say that still think oh inflation is
[12:48] good for the economy uh oh yeah prices
[12:51] go up but it's just because there's a
[12:53] war in Ukraine right now right yeah I've
[12:56] had to like develop a lot of empathy for
[12:58] the normies and the blue pilled people
[13:01] that like don't see what's going on
[13:02] because there's just
[13:05] um as as much of the financial
[13:07] manipulation that's going on there's
[13:09] also psychological manipulation going on
[13:11] um there's just such a strong propaganda
[13:15] apparatus which is running through
[13:18] everything and and you could look at it
[13:20] kind of as a just a misalignment of
[13:24] incentives and that people are just
[13:26] trying to maintain their control on
[13:28] power or you could look at it more as
[13:30] like a conspiracy that's that's
[13:32] coordinated and I sort of flip-flop
[13:34] between the two mostly on the lad but I
[13:38] understand why people don't understand I
[13:40] guess is the point because
[13:42] everything is oriented towards keeping
[13:44] you from noticing them everything in
[13:46] society TV movies radio uh the schools
[13:51] the the things we're taught the way they
[13:53] teach economics everything is oriented
[13:55] towards not noticing this and and so I
[13:58] get it but it is frustrating for sure um
[14:01] and it's kind of funny in a way too I
[14:03] found some humor in it just like yeah
[14:06] inflation's
[14:07] good yeah yeah it's when you notice
[14:10] someone is like oh but we need inflation
[14:13] to I had a conversation I was like uh
[14:16] and he said like um how was it I said oh
[14:20] well yeah but in in inflation is not
[14:22] good and he's like oh yeah inflation is
[14:25] is is not good but uh think about the
[14:27] poor people and then is like the poor
[14:30] people need inflation and I'm like wait
[14:33] really slow down let let me please
[14:35] explain me that like that one part real
[14:38] quick how does how does inflation help
[14:39] poor people yeah I mean his argument was
[14:43] completely BS but uh without inflation
[14:47] we don't have an incentive for new
[14:48] things to start and and like it was
[14:50] completely I don't even want
[14:53] to do this is how I usually approach it
[14:56] because like I just had a debate with
[14:57] somebody who actually had a a degree in
[14:59] economics and I don't I studied
[15:01] psychology um I learned about economics
[15:05] through Bitcoin so um he said he's a
[15:08] Keynesian and inflation's good like he
[15:10] knew enough to know that he's a
[15:11] Keynesian right and um I said okay well
[15:15] what it's doing right now is it's
[15:16] motivating people to spend money and
[15:18] that props up the GDP right that's what
[15:20] you guys want you keynesians so what do
[15:22] you think would happen if there wasn't
[15:25] inflation like would I still buy clothes
[15:27] would I still buy a car would I still
[15:28] buy a home home but I still buy
[15:30] Essentials yes of course because I need
[15:32] to live I need food right uh even if my
[15:35] money is going up I still need to eat uh
[15:38] I'm not going to just hoard all of it
[15:40] but what we have in the world right now
[15:43] is a over production of crap that we
[15:46] don't need like a lot of just waste a
[15:49] tremendous amount of plastic and
[15:51] nonsense that's only meant to be used
[15:53] once and if I knew that my money was
[15:57] going to go up I would only buy things
[15:59] that I know are going to last that I
[16:00] actually need so doesn't that solve the
[16:04] environmental problem that everybody's
[16:05] screaming about I mean this the whole
[16:07] thing is just one big apparatus right
[16:11] and and the yeah anyway I could go on
[16:14] but is it um when when we look at uh
[16:18] Global adoption and and sometimes I'm
[16:20] getting a little bit discouraged when we
[16:23] we look at Bitcoin adoption um I'm 100%
[16:26] sure Bitcoin itself will be successful
[16:30] but there's like this question how does
[16:31] it look that Bitcoin is actually
[16:33] successful some like oh Bitcoin is only
[16:35] successful if like fat dies and and and
[16:39] and there's only Bitcoin transactions
[16:41] and then there is like oh but if if fat
[16:44] is still around but Bitcoin is like at
[16:46] 100 million US Dollars was it successful
[16:48] I mean kind
[16:50] of it got we have done an asset where we
[16:54] can store our wealth in um but my
[16:57] question is like
[17:00] maybe this whole system that uh Fiat
[17:03] system survives and this bad things of
[17:06] the FI system stays that we are over
[17:09] consumption like we're printing money
[17:11] and we have inflation we have Bitcoin
[17:13] exit wealth but people don't get it
[17:14] because they don't really research
[17:16] themselves and they don't wake up and
[17:17] it's just a small minority and big
[17:20] corporations that buy in and because
[17:22] they get that Bitcoin is valuable
[17:23] similar than go similar right um yeah I
[17:27] have the same concerns about the way
[17:29] adoption is going to go and if it's
[17:30] going to liberate everybody or if it's
[17:32] just going to liberate me because I do
[17:33] care about that you know it's like at a
[17:35] certain point you do what's rational for
[17:38] you in that moment right but then once
[17:39] you know you're safe like you're in the
[17:41] Lifeboat right and you see everybody
[17:43] else is drowning you're like do you guys
[17:45] want to get in there's other lifeboats
[17:46] like it's still it's not too late like
[17:49] yeah I can help you but most people sort
[17:52] of slap my hand away they don't want to
[17:54] learn about Bitcoin they they think of
[17:55] it as like uh tinfoil hat money but but
[18:00] um I don't know I mean it's it's yeah
[18:03] it's yet to be seen what will actually
[18:05] happen with the Fiat system I genuinely
[18:08] don't want to see it collapse in a in a
[18:12] catastrophic way there are some
[18:14] bitcoiners I've heard say things like oh
[18:16] fiat's going to zero and it's like yeah
[18:18] I mean right now the Fiat system is
[18:21] causing suffering all over the planet
[18:22] there's no question if it goes to zero
[18:25] in a short period of time it will cause
[18:27] way more suffering
[18:29] than if it's a gradual decline and
[18:32] saine's Fiat standard kind of lays out a
[18:35] framework where it could be a gradual
[18:37] transition but it's all theoretical and
[18:39] that's the thing about economics is like
[18:42] you don't know until you know like
[18:43] there's too many variables it play yeah
[18:45] it's it's I I like the analogy of the
[18:48] Titanic uh the Titanic took like hours
[18:51] to syn uh and still not all not everyone
[18:56] was was uh rescued and so it's like like
[18:59] I I would like if the fat system dies I
[19:02] would really like it to Die slow very
[19:06] slow uh so that it's not like if it's a
[19:10] too quick of a dad like if the thing
[19:12] ships too quickly we don't have the time
[19:14] to get all the life BS and all the life
[19:16] rafts uh to the boat and and get people
[19:20] gone because uh like people will not
[19:24] adopt Bitcoin tomorrow just because uh
[19:26] there's uh the inflation is is rising
[19:29] like 10 20 30% like they need education
[19:32] they need like uh oh should I buy
[19:34] Bitcoin or should I buy go gold or
[19:37] should I buy an ETF like there are so
[19:38] many different options we see it in
[19:40] turkey turkey has like 100 150 200% of
[19:43] inflation and people still like they're
[19:46] not on a Bitcoin standard like right
[19:48] it's fascinating for me yeah and it
[19:50] raises a question like when when do
[19:53] people actually wake up yeah I was
[19:55] thinking of turkey while you're were
[19:56] saying that um I don't know what it's
[19:58] going to take to be honest but I think
[20:00] that it's entering the mainstream in a
[20:03] way right now that I've never seen
[20:04] before like I've been watching Bitcoin I
[20:07] didn't have it but I've been watching it
[20:09] since 2012 and at the time it was like
[20:11] such an obscurity like nobody knew what
[20:14] it was or what it was for nobody talked
[20:16] about it on TV and now like last night
[20:18] they just announced that Trump is going
[20:20] to be at Bitcoin Nashville which is
[20:22] insane I mean he might be love him or
[20:25] hate him the most recognizable face on
[20:27] the planet at the moment and um it's it
[20:31] feels like this can't go on much longer
[20:33] before the uh the Rapture candle you
[20:36] know like at a certain point enough
[20:38] people are going to look at it and if
[20:40] you look at it you have to reach a
[20:42] determination about it you can't just be
[20:43] neutral about Bitcoin you either adopt
[20:46] it or you fight it um if you ignore it I
[20:49] mean you can do that but pretty soon
[20:52] here it's going to be impossible to
[20:53] ignore and it's also uh funny that you
[20:55] brought up the Titanic because that I
[20:57] think is tied into the story of the
[20:58] Federal Reserve if you follow it back
[21:00] wait how is that tied in so um there
[21:03] were a bunch of people on the Titanic
[21:05] that did not want the Federal Reserve to
[21:06] be started and JP Morgan was supposed to
[21:09] be on it he was supposed to be on that
[21:11] boat and then like right when they were
[21:13] leaving he didn't he didn't get on or he
[21:16] left the boat or something like that so
[21:18] interesting yeah yeah yeah I mean story
[21:22] I you know I I don't like to go too deep
[21:24] into it because it's like what are you
[21:26] going to do but in
[21:29] interesting yeah I mean there there are
[21:31] so many factors in play he could be just
[21:34] like getting a call from his wife like
[21:36] oh or like there there could be so many
[21:38] reasons but I I've not heard that story
[21:41] at all like I'm I'm the first time that
[21:43] I hear it it's it's definitely
[21:45] interesting I'm not super deep on that
[21:47] one there are some people that know more
[21:48] than I do when we think about how people
[21:51] wake up I always think about myself
[21:53] because I was till 2020 the opinion that
[21:56] inflation is good for the economy
[21:59] uh I was a stock Pro if you say like
[22:02] that I was having a stock portfolio and
[22:05] I discovered Bitcoin in 20120 and then
[22:07] then I needed till 2021 till I'm
[22:09] actually all in Bitcoin and uh I'm
[22:12] thinking a lot about how my thinking
[22:16] changed and why I did wake up and all of
[22:20] the sudden thought about uh the money
[22:22] part and the Federal Reserve critical
[22:24] which I did not before um why did you
[22:28] wake up like what what was your like did
[22:30] you wake up with wake up is a weird term
[22:33] but did you saw those things then with
[22:36] Bitcoin or did you question it before
[22:38] already I was okay let me start at the
[22:41] beginning I studied psychology because
[22:44] like I could tell that something wasn't
[22:46] right in society like I could tell that
[22:48] people just weren't happy growing up as
[22:50] a kid like my family life wasn't the
[22:52] best but I could just tell like
[22:55] everybody I was living in a pretty
[22:56] affluent area and the people they were
[22:58] miserable and they were on drugs like
[23:00] pharmaceutical drugs and I was like
[23:01] what's going on you know like this is
[23:04] supposed to be this is this supposed to
[23:06] be like this I guess is the point and
[23:09] then um I went through my whole
[23:11] psychology journey and I realized that
[23:14] uh the psychologists that are teaching
[23:16] in the schools like they're just as
[23:18] backwards and arrogant as the Keynesian
[23:21] economists like they don't know what's
[23:23] going on they act like they have a lot
[23:26] of authority and they and they label
[23:28] people with these
[23:29] diagnoses but it's uh it's all part of
[23:32] the same like Fiat nonsense arrogance
[23:36] I'm the expert and you're supposed to
[23:37] listen to me right so I I didn't follow
[23:40] that route I I I went into something in
[23:42] between which was like business
[23:44] psychology and that was really talking a
[23:46] lot about incentives and motivation and
[23:50] how you incentivize people to work
[23:52] inside an organization to to increase
[23:54] productivity and stuff then when I got
[23:56] out of school I realized realiz it like
[23:59] and my professors said this they said
[24:01] when you get out of school you're going
[24:02] to be basically a hand servant to the
[24:05] evils in the world and I didn't
[24:08] understand that but now I do understand
[24:10] it because basically what they wanted me
[24:12] to do as an IO psychologist is like
[24:15] figure out how to squeeze productivity
[24:17] out of people without paying them more
[24:20] which is not the way that I wanted to
[24:21] use it right but anyway all of that
[24:23] aside the mental health health outcomes
[24:27] like the um the number one predictor of
[24:30] poor mental health is
[24:32] poverty it's it's very clear like that
[24:35] it actually changes your brain structure
[24:38] like the the food that you eat and the
[24:40] media that you consume and the
[24:42] experiences that you have as a child
[24:45] change your brain physically and um so I
[24:49] realized well why am I studying
[24:51] psychology it's kind of like um it's
[24:54] kind of like cleaning up plastic in the
[24:55] ocean while there's still plenty of it
[24:57] pouring in it's you're you're just
[25:01] putting a bandaid on it is the point and
[25:03] then I looked at like economics through
[25:05] Bitcoin it it C all of this came to me
[25:07] through Bitcoin and then I looked at the
[25:10] monetary system and I realized that's
[25:11] like our operating system for society
[25:14] and that's where the corruption
[25:16] begins and then it trickles its way down
[25:19] right so I don't believe that fixing the
[25:21] money is going to fix everything because
[25:24] we have a lot of baggage from everything
[25:26] that's gone on but um I think that if we
[25:30] don't fix the money we will never fix
[25:32] anything that everything is just going
[25:33] to get worse continuously so that was
[25:36] kind of my path but if I hadn't found
[25:38] Bitcoin I never would have noticed this
[25:39] because it wasn't on my radar at all and
[25:42] everything in Academia at least in the
[25:44] US is very siloed it's like you're going
[25:46] to study psychology and you're going to
[25:48] study economics and there's like
[25:50] behavioral economics there's a little
[25:52] bit in between but it's Keynesian so
[25:54] it's not really like totally holistic um
[25:57] there's there's very little that's
[25:59] having a really holistic approach to
[26:02] education um an ecological approach
[26:05] holistic means that like a whole
[26:08] approach right like a full picture yeah
[26:11] exactly like looking at the different
[26:12] shareholders and and like seeing how
[26:14] everything fits together where do you
[26:15] think uh Bitcoin will like obviously
[26:17] that's like all speculation but it's
[26:19] it's um interesting especially for new
[26:22] people that come in and try to figure
[26:24] out with what Bitcoin is going through
[26:26] and and where people where Bitcoin is
[26:29] going um where do you see Bitcoin like
[26:32] when
[26:32] you point out like 20 years like 30
[26:35] years 40 50 years in the future and
[26:38] you're like okay when I'm right and
[26:41] Bitcoin is successful where do you see
[26:44] Bitcoin and not like not from an US
[26:46] dollar price standpoint that's like but
[26:48] like from a from like where fit does it
[26:51] fit in the world is it the is it the
[26:53] world Reserve currency like where do you
[26:55] see it yeah that's a that's a big
[26:58] question question I mean I have had all
[27:01] kinds of visions of what the future
[27:03] could be like there are a lot of people
[27:05] in Bitcoin who believe that Bitcoin is
[27:07] inherently libertarian and I'm not
[27:10] entirely sure that's the case I know
[27:12] it's inherently right because it's it's
[27:15] anti-communist like it's it's pro-
[27:17] private property and so it just knocks
[27:19] the left out completely but it's not
[27:21] necessarily it could be used by an
[27:23] authoritarian State I mean it's being
[27:25] used right now in El Salvador by a at
[27:28] least visibly authoritarian state are
[27:31] they going to stay that way is he going
[27:33] to leave at the end of his term maybe I
[27:35] mean I I I like him but um I don't and
[27:39] also all the as salvadorians like him
[27:41] every es Salvadorian I meet likes him um
[27:45] so I don't know you know it's hard for
[27:47] me to see if this is really going to be
[27:50] like a net positive for everybody or if
[27:53] it's going to be mostly just a positive
[27:55] for the people that have it not sure one
[27:58] thing that was expressed to me I think I
[28:00] was talking to Jeff Booth or maybe I saw
[28:03] his talk or something I don't remember
[28:04] where where it came up he said when the
[28:08] corporations and governments start
[28:09] utilizing Bitcoin the incentive
[28:12] structure is going to trickle down in
[28:14] the sense that like if they're on a
[28:17] Bitcoin standard it's going to make
[28:19] things less crappy on the way down you
[28:22] know like um the the little guys are
[28:26] going to get screwed less often which
[28:29] sounds good I mean I I I understand it
[28:32] conceptually but again it's like I want
[28:35] to see it before I'm totally like oh
[28:38] yeah this is great you know thank you
[28:40] you already made it halfway through the
[28:42] video and I'm really really crateful to
[28:44] have you here two things make this
[28:46] channel possible you as a watcher and
[28:49] listener who keep supporting this
[28:51] Channel and another one is all the
[28:53] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[28:55] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[28:58] where we start and where I personally
[28:59] buy my Bitcoin from with code Robin you
[29:01] even get a discount when you buy Bitcoin
[29:04] with them and now also bitbox bitbox is
[29:07] the simplest and securest way to secure
[29:10] your Bitcoin and I heard a crazy
[29:12] statistics only 2% of bitcoiners hold
[29:15] their Bitcoin in a hardware wallet how
[29:17] crazy is that don't be in that 98%
[29:20] bracket be in the 2% bracket and if you
[29:23] have self custody and you know your
[29:24] friend does not have maybe he needs a
[29:26] Christmas present maybe he needs a birth
[29:28] the present and a small life hack if you
[29:30] use code Robin you get 5% off your order
[29:34] plus you support my channel and now
[29:36] let's get back to the video Yeah and
[29:38] especially when you you when you studied
[29:42] psychology um you're probably aware like
[29:44] there's a lot going on in the brain uh
[29:46] and and money is like one part of it but
[29:48] it's interesting what what you told me
[29:51] before with mental disease start from
[29:54] like poverty a lot of the things with
[29:55] the food and uh things when you come
[29:58] come to bitcoin standard and everything
[29:59] is like a little bit more designed
[30:01] towards it it it actually holds on
[30:04] longer like the the the things that we
[30:07] watch on on TV on on social media on
[30:10] nostro then maybe uh are a little bit
[30:13] more towards longterm more towards
[30:16] Health more to something sustainable uh
[30:19] and all those things come into place um
[30:23] is is that uh like eliminating also then
[30:25] mental disease to a certain extent or
[30:27] will those always be there well the
[30:31] first thing I guess is mental disease is
[30:35] just a concept which is
[30:38] also like tied into this idea that there
[30:40] are experts who know what's a mental
[30:43] disease and what's not right and so yeah
[30:47] the people that are that are locked up
[30:48] in the institutions right now they may
[30:52] not be there may not be anything like
[30:54] inherently wrong with them it could just
[30:57] be that we don't know how to deal with
[30:58] them right uh sometimes people get
[31:00] locked up because they say unpopular
[31:02] things in front of their family at
[31:04] Thanksgiving you know um so I I don't
[31:08] really label people that way exactly but
[31:11] I know what you're getting at which is
[31:13] basically like is uh well-being going to
[31:17] increase and if you look at maso's
[31:19] hierarchy are you familiar with that
[31:22] pyramid yeah okay so like the first
[31:24] thing I think if I remember right is
[31:26] safety and security right and like you
[31:30] can't really have safety if your savings
[31:33] are constantly being eroded and so you
[31:35] can't really build any higher in the
[31:38] pyramid if you're constantly running
[31:40] this this treadmill of like I don't have
[31:42] enough I don't have enough I don't have
[31:43] enough and that's basically what
[31:44] everybody's doing right now and um so I
[31:48] do think that Bitcoin has a propensity
[31:50] to bring people into a space where they
[31:54] have the potential to improve their
[31:57] lives doesn't necessarily mean that they
[31:59] will you know some I I know people or I
[32:02] don't know anybody actually but I've
[32:03] heard of people who bought really early
[32:06] who just sit around smoke weed and play
[32:07] video games all day and like they've
[32:09] been doing it for years and like okay
[32:12] but I think that in the same way that
[32:16] Bitcoin works on proof of work like if
[32:18] you don't put in the work to understand
[32:20] it and right really see where society's
[32:23] going and like map out the potential of
[32:26] what's happening right now you may
[32:28] change at all you know I I've heard
[32:30] people brag about the fact that they
[32:31] haven't changed their opinion since
[32:32] getting into Bitcoin and I always think
[32:35] yeah I don't know if that's a good thing
[32:38] I think like it's a it's a necessity as
[32:40] you're going through the Bitcoin journey
[32:42] to sort of break down those Concepts
[32:44] that you were attached to it's it's
[32:46] inherently shifts your
[32:49] perspective and you need that proof of
[32:51] work like it's in the end of the day
[32:53] it's just um a tool what we have with
[32:55] Bitcoin and uh everyone can decide what
[32:59] they want to do with it and I always
[33:01] make that uh comparison between fear and
[33:04] Bitcoin between running in a mat or like
[33:07] on a sand uh kind of a thing where you
[33:10] can run but it's like a little bit
[33:13] slippery like you get tracked down a
[33:15] little bit it's just a little bit harder
[33:16] to run on on mud and on on Sand if you
[33:20] run on a solid Street that's like the
[33:22] the comparison to bitcoin uh you
[33:25] actually get ahead faster uh you you
[33:28] have a solid foundation under you but
[33:31] you still have to run like if you don't
[33:32] do anything on a Bitcoin standard you
[33:34] you're still you don't go anywhere like
[33:36] if you just uh go go if you're just in
[33:40] front of the TV and and and have like
[33:42] video games or something like that
[33:44] nothing wrong with video games like it's
[33:46] it's great for re relaxation and stuff
[33:48] like that but um there's something wrong
[33:51] with it if you only do that right and so
[33:54] I think that proof of work mindset is
[33:56] really important as sometimes see uh
[33:59] that in the Bitcoin Community actually
[34:00] that low time preference is misused as
[34:04] like being lazy it's like oh I have a
[34:06] low time preference that that's why I
[34:08] don't do a
[34:09] lot what that's that's like Bitcoin is
[34:13] proof of work and low time preference
[34:15] just means that you build out things
[34:17] that last long that you don't want
[34:19] immediate gratification you build on
[34:21] hard things that take a long time and
[34:24] you build something big not just like
[34:25] the small thing for the next day or two
[34:28] so like low time preference has nothing
[34:31] to do with laziness and some sometimes I
[34:33] see it in the Bitcoin Community where it
[34:34] is misused for for an excuse to being
[34:36] lazy right yeah I've seen all kinds of
[34:39] Evolutions in the way bitcoiners
[34:41] interact with each other and the way
[34:42] that they think about them their own
[34:44] lives I mean me personally like I was I
[34:47] was working quite successfully in a
[34:49] corporate job and I was miserable and um
[34:53] so I got out I I quit and then I spent
[34:57] like 3 years doing almost nothing but
[35:00] that was very important for me to do
[35:03] that because I needed to like um
[35:05] deprogram myself from The Matrix and I
[35:09] spent a lot of that time working on a
[35:11] lecture series which I published as a
[35:13] podcast it took me about two years um
[35:16] and it's it's really like an audio book
[35:18] so um I did create something it's not I
[35:20] wasn't doing nothing I was I was reading
[35:22] about a book A Week you know so it
[35:24] wasn't like I was just sitting around
[35:26] doing nothing but a lot of the time was
[35:28] spent just kind of reflecting and and
[35:31] like developing a more spiritual
[35:33] understanding of who I am and what I'm
[35:34] doing here and how to relate to others
[35:37] and how to be more authentic for myself
[35:40] um but the the other interesting thing
[35:42] about time preference is that if you're
[35:45] constantly thinking in a low time
[35:46] preference mindset you're never living
[35:48] in the present moment and the spiritual
[35:51] journey is really about that it's about
[35:53] accepting the present and being present
[35:56] and being like
[35:59] in being in Union with what is and uh so
[36:06] there's a there's a constant tug like
[36:08] this Balancing Act between low time
[36:11] preference yeah like I want to do these
[36:13] things really far out in the future but
[36:16] then also being really accepting of like
[36:18] what's happening right now in this
[36:19] moment and that's kind of what I've been
[36:21] playing with over the last few years I
[36:22] have a really good example I think with
[36:24] the podcast because I have no clue where
[36:26] it goes in the future
[36:28] I just know I want to do it all my life
[36:30] like even if like right now I'm in a
[36:33] fortunate position where I actually can
[36:34] pay my bills with the podcast uh and do
[36:37] it fulltime if this ever changes I will
[36:41] still do my podcast uh but I have to
[36:43] slow it down and and do less of it and
[36:45] find a way to pay my bills in other ways
[36:49] um but uh it's it's something that I
[36:52] enjoy right now but it's something that
[36:56] could turn out to be something really
[36:58] big in the future and could turn out to
[37:00] be really good in the in the future for
[37:02] me so like it's like I'm I'm doing
[37:04] something that is is is really
[37:06] interesting for me right now and enjoy
[37:08] it a lot but
[37:10] also I'm building something maybe
[37:14] hopefully bigger here like let's see
[37:16] like come let's come back in 10 years to
[37:18] this video Let's see what actually got
[37:19] to build be but uh yeah that's that
[37:23] that's kind of where where I'm like if
[37:25] if you can find something where you
[37:27] actually build something bigger and you
[37:29] you you have a vision for that and and
[37:31] you have this low time preference
[37:32] mindset you put in a proof of work even
[37:35] right now and you happy with with and
[37:38] satisfied kind of with with the state I
[37:41] mean I don't know if you can ever be
[37:42] fully satisfied if you're fully
[37:44] satisfied maybe you you you don't want
[37:46] to do anything at least I have always
[37:48] like this this small thing is like ah it
[37:50] could be a little bit better this could
[37:52] be better this could be better I feel
[37:53] like sometimes this little bit of
[37:55] unsatisfaction is is the thing that
[37:57] drives here yeah if you're in full total
[38:00] acceptance of everything that is you're
[38:02] in like God Consciousness I mean that's
[38:06] that that then you just know
[38:07] everything's fine uh I've been there
[38:09] actually but only
[38:11] temporarily the um it sounds like you
[38:14] found the balance which is great and and
[38:16] so yeah if you can find a passion that
[38:18] works for you that's adding value and
[38:20] building something that's awesome
[38:22] personally I was in sales um before
[38:25] quitting and and just doing whatever I'm
[38:26] doing now and so I didn't really see
[38:28] where I was going to fit into the
[38:31] Bitcoin Network so what I did basically
[38:34] is I spent the last three years like
[38:35] orange peeling everybody I could like
[38:37] all my friends relatives everybody who
[38:40] was open to it you know and and that
[38:42] felt like a worthwhile thing to do and I
[38:45] think I was building something I didn't
[38:46] really benefit from it directly but I
[38:49] will in the future because those people
[38:52] will will benefit and we'll be able to
[38:54] like go on vacation together and stuff
[38:55] you know but um
[38:59] I just I I have a good time liberating
[39:01] people that's it that's that's what I
[39:04] enjoy doing that's that's really cool
[39:06] it's so funny how many uh podcast guests
[39:09] of mine were previously in sales like
[39:13] really I think I I I have to make a
[39:15] statistics like I I'm usually like like
[39:18] people in the comments sometimes ask me
[39:20] oh can you not ask the the guest like
[39:22] who they are what's the background but
[39:24] for me that's that's usually when I
[39:27] watch a podcast about someone and it's a
[39:29] specific topic and it the topic wasn't
[39:31] the thumbnail and title and everything
[39:32] and then the first 20 minutes is about
[39:34] the background and it's not really
[39:36] related to the the actual topic I get
[39:38] bored and I usually skip that so I try
[39:41] to not do
[39:42] it other only if it actually fits to the
[39:46] topic only if it actually fits there I
[39:48] so that's why I don't ask a lot but if I
[39:51] ask and if if it comes up it's usually
[39:53] like oh sales interesting yeah so so
[39:56] many times I have to make it maybe it's
[39:57] just a feeling that I have but because I
[40:00] myself was in sales also maybe that's
[40:03] why I see it more often uh it could be
[40:05] that also yeah you're resonating that
[40:07] sales energy I I did everything I can
[40:10] basically to like integrate my life with
[40:13] the Bitcoin Network that's I just my my
[40:17] psychology philosophy my my lifestyle
[40:21] everything and in fact I'm in the
[40:23] process of moving to a place to work on
[40:25] more Bitcoin related stuff and be around
[40:27] more bitcoiners so I'm like I'm fully in
[40:30] it's more than just my investment it's
[40:33] like every aspect of my life at this
[40:35] point
[40:36] almost it's really cool um let's talk
[40:39] about nostrils that I wanted to talk
[40:41] about before um for me it's an
[40:44] interesting thing right now I I would
[40:47] love to have this social craft aspect of
[40:50] of Nostra everywhere on the internet
[40:52] like when I see new guests or like I see
[40:56] someone new coming on anywhere I usually
[40:59] look at like their Twitter handle
[41:01] because that's my biggest Network and
[41:02] then I see like how many people follow
[41:04] them and like what's what's the
[41:06] interaction there uh and then I can
[41:08] really have this social graph but for me
[41:12] Nostra is like what if we can put this
[41:15] everywhere on on all our digital lives
[41:18] and you can like see oh there is is that
[41:22] but maybe like get let get your
[41:24] perspective like what's what's for you
[41:26] Nostra and
[41:27] how will it impact our digital lives I
[41:31] love Noster so much um I am a complete
[41:35] Noster pleb in the sense that like I
[41:37] don't understand a single line of code
[41:40] and there's a lot of people on there
[41:41] that are devs and they're like writing
[41:43] code and there's people that have joined
[41:44] Noster and then become devs or like
[41:47] started getting involved in at least
[41:49] like uh writing the instructions for
[41:52] apps and stuff um Noster to me is a
[41:56] Liberation from big Tech in terms of
[41:59] social media and eventually probably
[42:02] other things I mean we've got wav Lake
[42:04] which is uh audio we've got Noster nests
[42:09] which is like chatting like this
[42:11] although I think there're still
[42:12] implementing video um and and it's all
[42:16] running off your End pub and right now
[42:18] it's a it's a mess like there's you know
[42:21] you log into every site with a different
[42:23] way and it's kind of clunky and
[42:26] sometimes like I'll log in and I'll have
[42:28] zero followers or I'll have zero people
[42:31] that I follow or something or like I'll
[42:33] have to adjust my relays it's not
[42:36] perfectly ironed out yet but we're in
[42:38] the alpha or beta testing of Noster and
[42:42] I really like the idea of free open
[42:45] communication because when you're
[42:47] interacting with somebody online on uh
[42:50] on Facebook there's a Overton window of
[42:53] like what you're allowed to talk about
[42:54] and what is acceptable behavior and so
[42:57] you don't really see that real person at
[43:00] all you know um the people that I'm
[43:03] following on Noster they are nice people
[43:06] and I know that because nobody's forcing
[43:08] them to be nice people like they're
[43:09] actually
[43:11] nice uh yeah I and the the feeling on
[43:15] there is better I I am convinced you
[43:18] know I have no evidence of this but I am
[43:19] convinced that Twitter and Facebook
[43:22] intentionally rile people up like they
[43:24] get you emotional and angry because
[43:27] people are addicted to those emotions
[43:29] and so they keep going back for the same
[43:31] like dopamine hit like when you get on
[43:33] Twitter and you see there's an argument
[43:34] or somebody responded to something you
[43:36] sent months ago and your fight ORF
[43:39] flight kicks in I mean that's literally
[43:42] leeching your energy away from you so um
[43:45] yeah that's why I love Noster I don't
[43:47] that nobody really like does that on
[43:49] Noster and if somebody does I just mute
[43:52] them and they can still post on my post
[43:54] but I don't see it which is great it's
[43:55] like peace of mind for me
[43:58] is do you think that's because we early
[44:00] in Nostra and and the masses are not not
[44:03] there yet or is that actually something
[44:05] that could change I think it's a two-way
[44:07] street like the reason Noster is clunky
[44:09] is because there's not a lot of people
[44:11] on it and there's not a lot of people on
[44:13] it because it's clunky um but it's
[44:15] gotten way better than when I got on I
[44:17] got on initially on astral ninja which
[44:20] was like an absolute it was just like
[44:23] HTML code and that was it it was it was
[44:26] very basic
[44:27] and um now we're using I'm using
[44:30] amethyst there's Damas Primal is like
[44:32] super smooth super clean there's like
[44:34] different benefits pros and cons between
[44:36] the different clients so the ecosystem
[44:39] is developing and I see money coming in
[44:41] from open SATs and from Jack thank you
[44:43] Jack for putting on nost rasia and uh
[44:47] and I guess nostri too I don't think I'm
[44:49] gonna make it to that one unfortunately
[44:50] that'd be my third trip to Europe in one
[44:52] year which is like way too much at the
[44:54] moment but anyway yeah uh I think it's I
[44:58] think it's inevitable um I think that
[45:00] censorship on the centralized platforms
[45:02] is inevitable and I don't want to have
[45:05] any part of that I want people to be
[45:07] able to say what they're what they're
[45:09] thinking because having an open
[45:12] conversation is the only way to avoid
[45:14] violence in my opinion like if you if
[45:16] you suppress speech if you tell people
[45:18] what they're not allowed to talk about
[45:20] you're just creating resentment and
[45:22] anger and and like yeah there's
[45:25] definitely stupid stuff misinformation
[45:27] and hate speech and all that stuff on
[45:29] the internet but that's that's human
[45:32] nature I'd rather see it out in the open
[45:34] than um have it behind closed doors so
[45:37] that's what Noster is about in my
[45:39] opinion do you think that pig t a big D
[45:43] Tech is actually uh plugging into Nostra
[45:46] at some point because uh the network
[45:48] effect is too big that's interesting uh
[45:52] I don't think so I think that they're so
[45:55] bought into to the Govern the state
[45:59] system and the money printer that
[46:02] they're not going to be able to Pivot
[46:03] they're not going to want to Pivot the
[46:04] incentives aren't there I think what
[46:08] this is kind of the scariest possibility
[46:09] of the future is that like as open
[46:12] source Ai and other softwares outco
[46:15] compete Enterprise those uh big Tech
[46:19] actors are going to side with the state
[46:22] to try to create a greater Monopoly and
[46:26] the state is going to side with them
[46:27] because they have the surveillance
[46:28] apparatus and it's basically going to be
[46:30] like a big Tech government collaboration
[46:33] which is already visible I mean um it's
[46:36] already visible with uh with Facebook
[46:38] and the NSA and all that so um and the
[46:42] FBI it it is happening but I know that
[46:46] Americans love the internet and so like
[46:48] we're probably going to be able to
[46:50] withstand the the censorship That's My
[46:53] Hope anyway yeah it's a lot of a lot of
[46:57] talks unfortunately only on Twitter not
[46:59] in in mainstream media was released once
[47:02] the the Twitter files were released that
[47:05] that was a that was a big moment where
[47:07] it got like so obvious that both
[47:11] political parties in America use a
[47:14] Twitter and you can be 100% sure they
[47:17] use all the other social medias also uh
[47:19] to actually influence stuff to mute
[47:22] words to uh prioritize things to deers
[47:26] St thing that's that's scary like this
[47:29] what you're telling us that like Pig
[47:31] Tech is collaborating with government
[47:33] that's like all already here and it's
[47:35] like already since years here right yeah
[47:37] it's not it's not even a conspiracy
[47:39] theory it's like actively there's
[47:41] evidence for that so I it's it's a
[47:44] little scary um but at the same time
[47:46] like I just have this overwhelming
[47:48] optimism in the resilience of the human
[47:50] spirit and I don't think that it's going
[47:52] to be a problem I think Nostra is
[47:53] winning so Nostra is basically
[47:57] what Bitcoin the central banks is doing
[48:00] nostr is doing the big
[48:02] te yeah uh I hope so you know I mean
[48:05] it's it's still a uh it's still a
[48:08] somewhat theoretical platform I mean
[48:10] it's working but uh as far as scaling
[48:13] goes we don't really know how things are
[48:15] going to scale is it going to stay
[48:17] decentralized there's still questions
[48:19] but uh there there are a lot of devs
[48:21] that are way smarter than I am that
[48:23] really believe in it so um I'm I'm
[48:26] excited about that you know I'm excited
[48:28] about their bullishness at least from
[48:30] the technical standpoint but as far as
[48:33] the usage standpoint it's the only
[48:34] social media I want to go on it's like
[48:36] The Vibes are way better everybody's
[48:38] posting funny stuff and it feels like
[48:41] we're pregaming a really cool party like
[48:43] there's GNA be a great party and we're
[48:45] there like two hours early you know it's
[48:48] uh it's interesting I was really heavily
[48:51] uh on Twitter last year I pivoted away
[48:54] uh right now to only long from content I
[48:58] still do short Fromm content on Twitter
[49:00] I do still do tweets but I rarely like I
[49:03] I I don't do as excessive as I do did
[49:06] the tweets last year uh and the main
[49:09] reason is um I only see my long form
[49:13] video
[49:14] comments
[49:16] speaking 99% in the comments uh are
[49:20] people that actually watch the interview
[49:22] to some extent at least uh and the POS
[49:25] the comments are way more positive the
[49:27] comments are way more um insightful they
[49:30] are longer they are they actually did
[49:33] something and on Twitter I feel like
[49:35] because it's so short form there's like
[49:37] a sentence or like two sentence or just
[49:39] a picture or something like that and
[49:41] people get enraged and then commented on
[49:44] that and and I feel like when I put some
[49:47] some long format video out on YouTube um
[49:50] people are like oh interesting insights
[49:53] oh I want to add this here and stuff
[49:54] like that I put a short form stuff
[49:57] no matter if it's video or text on
[49:59] Twitter people are like oh no that's not
[50:02] true no no that you forgot that and like
[50:06] it it it seems like um no matter like
[50:11] nostro thing like I pivoted away from
[50:14] from from Twitter a little bit and focus
[50:16] now on like podcasting long firm things
[50:19] like this this kind of feels like a
[50:20] little bit more low time preference
[50:23] unfortunately I did not get to the
[50:24] nostril really till now I have to get
[50:28] more um in inclined and more practical
[50:32] with with Nostra um and the only thing
[50:35] that I have I think like Fountain is
[50:38] working on on interacting with Nostra
[50:40] and I'm on Fountain so that's I think my
[50:42] only uh real uh connection there yeah
[50:45] but you've got the Noster account I
[50:47] tagged you this morning just saying like
[50:48] I was about to go on your podcast so um
[50:51] I know your your face is on there I
[50:53] searched you yeah I've I've been there
[50:56] like uh uh in the beginning I have an
[50:58] account um I've even
[51:01] uh how what's what's the name post there
[51:05] yeah we don't know what it's called I
[51:06] mean you can call it whatever you want
[51:07] nobody's in charge so you know call an
[51:10] pub called it a profile yeah yeah
[51:14] definitely it's it's really interesting
[51:17] um one last thing before we get to the
[51:18] end routine um your name is Source note
[51:21] uh do do you where does this come from
[51:24] uh the the name so
[51:27] source is as I as I think about it it's
[51:33] the where we all come from and where we
[51:36] all go when we
[51:38] die um that's just one word for it you
[51:40] could call it Christ you could call it
[51:42] Buddha Consciousness you could call it
[51:44] the the Dharma or the towel um you could
[51:47] call it whatever you want right but it's
[51:49] sort of a metaphor cuz we're all Source
[51:52] nodes like we're all just pieces of this
[51:56] whole
[51:57] this dialectic which is taking place of
[52:00] like you and I
[52:01] talking as fragmented individuals of one
[52:05] whole uh and it's just for fun I guess I
[52:08] mean it's really just for us to have
[52:10] this experience so that's where the name
[52:13] comes from but it's it's like uh
[52:16] specifically Bitcoin related like only
[52:18] somebody who understands Bitcoin and
[52:21] spirituality would like understand the
[52:23] name so there's you know it it it comes
[52:26] and goes it's it's interesting I like it
[52:30] when it's like um there's some story to
[52:33] it like there's some oh you have to to
[52:36] get Bitcoin you have
[52:37] to to get the spear I cannot pronounce
[52:41] that name I'm so sorry that's okay I'm
[52:43] I'm a I I tried it I feel like at least
[52:46] like four times already on the podcast
[52:48] say spiritual yeah spiritual a spiritual
[52:51] can you can you say squirrel
[52:54] squirrel I love that I asked my German
[52:57] friends to say squirrel every time yeah
[53:00] that's
[53:03] good uh perfect um uh one last question
[53:06] before we come to the endro te is a
[53:07] question every guest of mine gets um to
[53:11] the the aim of that question is to get
[53:14] something uh from my guests outside of
[53:18] Bitcoin um and the question is what can
[53:21] we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[53:24] so yeah what I'm my main project at the
[53:28] moment is like trying to learn how to be
[53:32] more authentic version of myself and one
[53:35] of the primary tools I've used to do
[53:38] that is psychedelics and so I created a
[53:41] a podcast lecture series called the
[53:43] holotropic renaissance renaissance let
[53:46] me say it right talking about that and
[53:48] and it basically what it is is a long
[53:52] form explanation of what I see as the
[53:54] best practices for safe use use of
[53:57] psychedelics and it's not something that
[53:59] I recommend people do or suggest people
[54:02] do but it's um it's a it's a a body of
[54:06] information that if you're interested
[54:09] it's available and so that's what I
[54:11] created as a contribution to the Bitcoin
[54:13] Network um that's unrelated to bitcoin
[54:16] and I do have one or I have two episodes
[54:18] in there one about Bitcoin and one about
[54:20] why I don't invest in crypto uh but
[54:22] otherwise it's all it's all like
[54:24] psychology related spirituality related
[54:28] and the the why no altcoins is also
[54:30] interesting what what is your uh did you
[54:33] dabble with with altcoins or why you got
[54:36] got out of that yeah I mean in 2017 the
[54:40] Bitcoin standard was not out and I was
[54:42] not like primed by the mees Institute
[54:44] already to understand sound money so I
[54:46] didn't understand anything about crypto
[54:49] or Bitcoin or any of that but um and I
[54:51] wanted to mention this specifically
[54:53] actually so I'm glad you asked at the
[54:54] top of the bull run in 2017 I read an
[54:57] article by this guy named crypto Yoda
[55:00] and he said in this article like just to
[55:02] summarize it yes I know xrp has gone
[55:06] from like
[55:07] 0.003 to $3 but is that a future that
[55:11] you want to invest in and it really got
[55:14] me thinking about the more underlying
[55:17] like ideological reasoning behind crypto
[55:21] and I didn't know what a cbdc was but I
[55:24] had an intuitive feeling about oh yeah
[55:26] yeah if they can control the money if
[55:27] it's not decentralized that takes away
[55:30] the ownership that takes away the whole
[55:31] purpose of it and so that article is
[55:35] ultimately what orange pilled me um and
[55:38] I think that guy's still trading
[55:40] shitcoins but but like that article was
[55:43] enough for me to realize that Bitcoin is
[55:45] the only stable coin and um so I I just
[55:50] rode the the bare Market it was rough
[55:53] 80% 80% draw down but
[55:57] uh it you know bare markets build
[55:59] character so thankful for it and
[56:02] whenever like it it gets rough there is
[56:05] like the character and then when it gets
[56:07] uh up again then then you can see uh
[56:10] what what character was
[56:11] building yeah well put that's true I'm
[56:15] I'm I'm really looking forward like um
[56:18] to a massive bull market and see who's
[56:22] trying to scam people who's who who's
[56:25] who are the the real people that are
[56:27] just like doing the the hard work and
[56:29] and not trying to like because scamming
[56:32] people in in the bare Market um is a lot
[56:35] harder than scamming people in a bull
[56:36] market uh so I think we there are some
[56:40] some scammers out there that are not
[56:42] Expos the scamers but they will be once
[56:45] once when we have a full running bull
[56:48] run where we like all of the sudden have
[56:50] those God candles and we have Donald
[56:53] Trump President says like hey buy
[56:55] Bitcoin we I want all Bitcoin in America
[56:58] all all that things that might happen
[57:00] next year the chances of him not
[57:02] supporting shitcoins is like near zero
[57:04] in my opinion but yeah you're right it
[57:07] the the bare Market shakes people out
[57:09] and the bull market shakes people out
[57:10] but at this point I've been in long
[57:12] enough and I've like listened to
[57:13] bitcoiners long enough that you can kind
[57:14] of tell who's going to make it and who's
[57:16] not like there are people that are just
[57:17] scammy and you talk to them and they're
[57:20] just like you could tell you know uh it
[57:23] comes in time I hope I'm not one of them
[57:26] not getting that Vibe at
[57:27] all um one thing that I want to not note
[57:31] about Trump um I liked that he said
[57:37] crypto and Bitcoin not because he
[57:39] mentioned crypto uh he just mentions
[57:41] crypto because he has to mention it but
[57:43] I like that even on his level he makes a
[57:48] differentiation between those he just
[57:50] not says just crypto it would be better
[57:52] if he just says Bitcoin um but I like
[57:56] that he doesn't say crypto in
[57:58] itself but he says like crypto and
[58:01] Bitcoin this means that we got to the
[58:05] point where probably the next president
[58:08] of America uh like I have no like I'm
[58:11] not in America I
[58:13] have I really don't care about who gets
[58:15] the presidency like I always try to not
[58:18] note that at that point but as I see it
[58:21] from the outside it's very probable that
[58:23] that he actually will be uh the next
[58:25] president uh the next president saying
[58:27] like there's Bitcoin and there's crypto
[58:30] that's like another thing and that's a
[58:32] major thing to accomplish yeah it's it's
[58:34] wild actually coming from a time like I
[58:37] mentioned earlier where it wasn't even
[58:38] mentioned on the news to now the
[58:40] potential president of the United States
[58:42] like ex-president of the United States
[58:43] and probably the next one is talking
[58:46] about it this way and like is he he's
[58:48] getting his talking points from somebody
[58:49] at Bitcoin magazine just so you know so
[58:51] like it's not him somebody's writing his
[58:54] speeches just the way it is with any
[58:55] politician
[58:56] um but yeah I mean it's it's public
[59:00] facing it's it's huge and I think even
[59:02] most coiners know that like Bitcoin
[59:05] is the king and then everything else is
[59:07] gambling like they they kind of know it
[59:09] deep down so it's just going to become
[59:10] more and more obvious as time goes on
[59:13] yeah I think this is also interesting or
[59:15] important to note I don't think Trump is
[59:17] a bitcoiner at all right but it's
[59:23] very very impressive to see that he sees
[59:30] that he has to talk about Bitcoin yeah
[59:32] yeah that basically that means we won
[59:34] already yeah that that that means like
[59:36] he has such a big need that he has to
[59:40] say that things and he has to go to the
[59:42] conference and he has to do all those
[59:45] things because he knows that's a big big
[59:48] voters group he does not do it because
[59:50] oh I want sound money or anything of
[59:52] that he he without presidency he would
[59:55] never talk about Bitcoin I think in his
[59:57] life maybe like in in 10 years I have no
[60:00] clue but right now not but he talks
[60:02] about it because it's necessary and he's
[60:05] like oh bid is against it oh it's a big
[60:07] voters group that's like interesting
[60:09] comparison there's like around 50
[60:11] million bitcoiners or Bitcoin and crypto
[60:14] people in in in America and the same
[60:16] amount of Dogo dogs in in America and so
[60:20] like it's if you against Bitcoin it's
[60:22] like saying oh we should not have dogs
[60:25] right like all the people that have dogs
[60:27] like don't vote for me yeah exactly
[60:30] basically over a long enough time frame
[60:32] all politicians become simps for Bitcoin
[60:34] and they're all gonna have to kiss our
[60:36] ass and that's what Trump is doing right
[60:37] now and we don't need Trump but Trump
[60:40] needs us and like that's the that's
[60:43] ultimately where it ends up however this
[60:45] is going to be probably very helpful
[60:47] because the last Administration was not
[60:49] favorable and um I'm already saying that
[60:52] it's not even out yet uh I don't know I
[60:56] don't really like politics but if it
[60:58] affects me then then I of course I pay
[61:01] attention I'm so Envy of America because
[61:04] in in in Europe uh none of the good
[61:08] politicians high up are mentioning
[61:11] Bitcoin I mean there are some Parliament
[61:13] again in Germany someone I have no clue
[61:16] about if there's someone in Austria I
[61:18] have not heard of one and I'm living in
[61:20] Austria uh but on the European leading
[61:24] um however they are called like I'm I'm
[61:26] so far away from politics I don't even
[61:28] know what they are called the the you
[61:30] commissioner and stuff like that they
[61:31] never mention Bitcoin I listened to the
[61:35] uh Austrian few I mean austri is a
[61:36] really small country but still it's
[61:38] probably representative of like other
[61:40] European countries and I have read all
[61:45] the programs of the political parties
[61:47] and they're like five that will be voted
[61:49] in in in in in Austria not like in
[61:51] America too it's like actually five
[61:53] different parties and they all have like
[61:56] a program for the EU election it's like
[61:59] 100 pages long it's like actually like a
[62:01] big program with a lot of things written
[62:04] and I could not find even the word
[62:07] Bitcoin crypto or cryptocurrencies like
[62:09] not even the like I was actually
[62:11] downloading all five of them uh and I
[62:13] was uh
[62:15] searching crypto Bitcoin uh digital
[62:19] currencies all that it wasn't even
[62:22] mentioned uh it's like we are so far
[62:26] away and then I see America and there's
[62:29] like the leading candidate is coming to
[62:31] the Bitcoin conference and the leading
[62:33] candidate is talking about Bitcoin no
[62:36] matter if it's a Bitcoin or not like
[62:38] that's huge and I'm really Envy of
[62:40] America that they are again way further
[62:43] than the European
[62:45] Union yeah it's not really surprising I
[62:47] guess like the EU is super blue pilled
[62:49] but uh and they're probably quite
[62:52] co-opted also and I would imagine it's
[62:54] very politically unpopular to bring up
[62:55] Bitcoin in the EU because of how
[62:58] co-opted they are by the Banks um here I
[63:01] don't know I mean I think Bitcoin is the
[63:04] only chance for the US to save the union
[63:08] from like dissolution um and even then I
[63:11] don't know that it really will but uh if
[63:13] we go through hyperinflation this
[63:15] country will break apart into pieces for
[63:16] sure there's no doubt um there's there's
[63:19] just too much animosity between states
[63:21] at this point absolutely perfect then
[63:24] let's come to do the end routine of the
[63:26] podcast where the previous guest is
[63:28] asking a question for the next guest
[63:30] without knowing who the next guest
[63:31] actually is uh and your question is an
[63:34] interesting one has also nothing to do
[63:36] with Bitcoin um what are you going to do
[63:39] today to make your life better tomorrow
[63:42] I think I'm going to go to the gym um
[63:44] what time is it let's see yeah I'm
[63:46] definitely going to the gym today so
[63:48] that's the answer but um probably also
[63:51] go out and Sun my
[63:53] balls I love that
[63:56] it's extremely hot right now in Vienna
[63:57] so I will also go out and and the gym
[64:00] but uh it's it's very hot like it's I'm
[64:05] sweating here because it's just like
[64:06] really hot in the studio oh man you guys
[64:09] don't have as much AC over there feel
[64:11] bad for you uh I thought about an AC
[64:14] actually like there are like ACS that
[64:16] can cool and and heat and it would be
[64:20] strong enough for like that that room
[64:23] and it's like in the winters I need
[64:24] maybe an heater and in the summer need
[64:26] like cooler but like most days it's fine
[64:30] it's just like a few like there's a one
[64:31] month in summer where it's a little too
[64:33] hot there's like a few weeks in the
[64:35] winter it's maybe a little bit too cold
[64:37] and rest of the year it's really fine
[64:39] you don't need it um and there's like an
[64:41] air purifier in those ACS so I would
[64:44] like that maybe also but um it's it's
[64:48] just like a month maybe sounds pretty
[64:51] nice then actually you you've got Stone
[64:53] buildings over there too so they
[64:55] probably hold the temperature a lot
[64:56] better yeah it's uh it's really like
[64:59] it's it's all L like if you like open
[65:03] the windows in the night and get the
[65:04] cold air in and then close everything
[65:06] during the day uh it's pretty cool
[65:09] inside and then you go out like it's
[65:11] really hot so with even without AC so uh
[65:14] I'm I'm pretty satisfied with it so I
[65:16] probably will not buy one I I save the
[65:19] sets yeah right I feel that perfect then
[65:23] yeah thank you for for being on uh um
[65:26] and yeah before I let you go where can
[65:28] people find you or what's your npop on
