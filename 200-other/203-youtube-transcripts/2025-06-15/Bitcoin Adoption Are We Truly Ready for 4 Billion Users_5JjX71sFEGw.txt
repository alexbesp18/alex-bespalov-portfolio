[00:00] from a user perspective you would always
[00:02] say yeah I want everything now Bitcoin
[00:04] derives its strength from not being
[00:07] changed easily and the market will tell
[00:09] us what is working what users want will
[00:12] you start off um directly self custodial
[00:15] I think for most people that's just not
[00:17] realistic so you just have one QR code
[00:20] and the user um doesn't necessarily need
[00:23] to know whether they are paying with on
[00:25] chain or lightning if all of the people
[00:28] would discover Bitcoin uh at once we
[00:30] would certainly have a problem I don't
[00:32] want Bitcoin to grow too fast that would
[00:34] mean the feat system completely wrecks
[00:37] your neighbors all your family all your
[00:39] loved ones are in big trouble so
[00:41] something that you don't wish for the
[00:43] world most people are interested in fat
[00:45] Gaines initially that's also why [ __ ]
[00:47] coins work we should try to make it one
[00:51] big system and not tear them apart in
[00:54] some custodial kyc kind of Bitcoin and
[00:58] and then is there the self Studio be
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] kind did you do this um as your main
[01:08] business or is that just I I do only
[01:11] only podcasting now nice nice it it's
[01:15] fascinating yeah I was like starting I
[01:18] I'm not even like one year in the
[01:19] podcasting
[01:21] MH and I started this as just like a
[01:24] side project of just like oh let's let's
[01:26] talk with some bitcoiners I mean I
[01:28] already talk with bitcoiners but never
[01:29] record recorded and I was like I can
[01:30] record that and just put it up then I
[01:32] have a podcast and then someone
[01:35] approached me from from a company and
[01:38] said like hey we want to sponsor you and
[01:39] I was like wait
[01:41] like I don't do that as a job like it's
[01:44] just like a a side thing and but they we
[01:47] we want to do work with together with
[01:49] you and okay let's okay there's money in
[01:52] uh then they they just like okay if
[01:54] there's money in then then let's let's
[01:56] let's just do it full time interesting
[01:59] interesting and now I'm actually on the
[02:01] in at the same level that I was before
[02:04] with with earning like I I reached that
[02:06] level kind of like in the last one two
[02:08] months uh and it was a big moment for me
[02:11] was like oh [ __ ] like I didn't even
[02:12] start it like if a year ago and and now
[02:15] I'm already there where I wanted to be
[02:18] um it it was fascinating and that in a
[02:20] not
[02:21] exciting uh time like Bitcoin is not
[02:24] ripping like twox or something like that
[02:27] it's a good time but not like a crazy
[02:28] Bull Run or something like that
[02:30] that's interesting I would also have
[02:32] quite some questions for you then
[02:34] maybe about the podcasting because um
[02:38] with Alby we also have quite some
[02:41] podcasters we support this podcasting
[02:43] 2.0 um movement um you can receive
[02:47] booster Gams and stuff um what isting
[02:52] 2.0 oh you you never heard about that
[02:55] you know like the boosts and the the the
[02:58] streaming payment and these kind of so
[03:01] value for Value basically exactly yeah
[03:04] yeah do you use that with your podcast I
[03:06] didn't really check
[03:09] sorry uh I uh have my podcast on
[03:12] Fountain that's that's where I get
[03:14] streams and
[03:16] boost and uh I mean I also post uh the
[03:20] links on Primal so like Nostra and
[03:24] Fountain is connected with my Noster
[03:26] anyways so that's my only where I do
[03:29] value for value on bitcoin there's
[03:31] another value for value on YouTube where
[03:34] I have channel members because YouTube
[03:36] offers that and I was like okay let's
[03:38] enable that it's just like a click of a
[03:40] button and there are some people that
[03:42] give me money I would love for that to
[03:44] be Bitcoin because I have to give 50% of
[03:47] that to
[03:48] YouTube but without YouTube I wouldn't
[03:50] have it anyways so uh there there's a uh
[03:55] there's a lot of things that come peerto
[03:57] peer so like value for value but
[04:01] honestly
[04:02] 95% of the money is coming from ad
[04:06] Revenue YouTube and Twitter uh and
[04:08] sponsor payments like that's 95% of the
[04:12] the
[04:12] things here and there there's like a big
[04:15] payment from a supporter who just like
[04:18] here is some Bitcoin uh I really love
[04:20] your show and I want to support that
[04:22] that's rare but there is something like
[04:25] there are some ogs that just like
[04:26] anonymously give you a lot of money not
[04:29] a lot of like like a few hundred years
[04:31] maybe but like uh that that's that
[04:34] stands out to me uh and funny enough
[04:37] those are usually those people that
[04:39] don't even present themselves they just
[04:41] like really just want to give without
[04:43] even me having the possibilities to to
[04:45] give them back or credit them or
[04:46] something like that that's quite
[04:48] interesting about the Bitcoin Community
[04:50] yeah that's true yeah yeah but
[04:52] interesting that you say it's like um
[04:55] still um 95% ad revenue and
[05:00] yeah basically business is paying um so
[05:04] we have quite some way to go there I
[05:06] mean it's it's kind of it's a it's a
[05:09] hard sell for someone to uh pay for
[05:15] something you can have for free like how
[05:17] do you do do you have like with Alby you
[05:19] have way more data than me because I
[05:21] only have my own data uh how do you see
[05:24] that like how How likely are people to
[05:27] do that and and what what do do you see
[05:29] it
[05:30] Alby yeah I mean I guess it's still a
[05:33] bit small to build your business um
[05:36] completely on value for Value but if you
[05:41] if you think about the future and maybe
[05:43] I don't know 10 years in or something
[05:46] and a lot more people are exposed to
[05:48] bitcoin possibly and use that in their
[05:52] everyday wallets or whatever um I I can
[05:56] see a future where that um where that
[05:59] works out um currently like I said also
[06:02] for us it's it's way too small to
[06:04] sustain uh yeah business basically um
[06:08] and we see similar patterns so there are
[06:10] um a few ones that um just think the
[06:14] products are awesome and want to give
[06:16] back and they donate a bit more there
[06:19] are a lot of uh people out there just
[06:22] donating small amounts um yeah guess
[06:26] it's maybe I should try it I think uh
[06:29] Tomic came up to me at Bitcoin Amsterdam
[06:32] and said to me hey just put like a ALB
[06:36] Link in your description and then all
[06:37] the ALB users get automatically a pop up
[06:40] when they see my podcast so they can uh
[06:42] support something like that is that is
[06:44] that true um on YouTube so with the
[06:47] extension we support um some websites so
[06:51] for instance if you are on Twitter um on
[06:56] medium on GitHub there's like more sites
[07:00] that we support where you can just add
[07:03] it to your description like you say or
[07:05] you to your profile on GitHub um and the
[07:09] alv extension will pick up your
[07:11] lightning address and if you then click
[07:13] on the extension icon um which turns
[07:16] green uh if we find such info on this
[07:19] particular page um users can just click
[07:22] on it and um send uh value back by just
[07:27] clicking two buttons basically so it's
[07:29] more of a a Streamlight process but it's
[07:31] but also on on on YouTube also on
[07:34] YouTube yeah yeah it's it's a bit hard
[07:37] honestly um to keep up because every
[07:40] time YouTube changes something or
[07:43] Twitter changes something within their
[07:45] website um you might need to update the
[07:47] extension to um to have the latest um
[07:51] Dom structure that we can pars to get
[07:54] this info uh from um yeah it's yeah it's
[07:59] a bit of a a heck but some people seem
[08:02] to use
[08:03] it it's it's interest I I actually um my
[08:08] Fe job before was it security and we had
[08:12] a tool where we actually scanned
[08:14] websites and we worked for big companies
[08:17] um uh like they have uh hundreds of
[08:21] thousands sometimes even like tens of
[08:22] thousands of of of domains and and
[08:25] websites going um with all the
[08:27] subdomains of course uh so that
[08:30] we we scanned all those and so we we
[08:32] know when like they wanted to find
[08:35] patterns and they wanted to find
[08:36] something in the website and like yeah
[08:37] it's it's hard to to to see if if it's
[08:40] actually like there uh and it's I I I
[08:43] know the struggle for from from that
[08:46] perspective and actually myself I I
[08:49] learned to be a software developer but
[08:51] I'm not good in that
[08:53] like I always try to say that because
[08:56] when when I say I'm oh I'm a software
[08:57] developer people assume I have a lot lot
[08:59] of knowledge about the software also
[09:02] around Bitcoin but I'm not that good in
[09:05] the the tech and the scaling of of
[09:07] Bitcoin which bring kind of kind of to
[09:09] my first topic uh when we jump directly
[09:12] in how do you envision that we uh scale
[09:17] Bitcoin obviously Alby lightning there
[09:19] are so many applications around that but
[09:21] on a on a on a bigger scale how do you
[09:23] see Bitcoin scaling on on more
[09:28] layers um yeah I guess the most obvious
[09:30] thing is currently lightning which is
[09:34] still which still has a very long way to
[09:36] go I guess um with Al hop and Al go
[09:40] we're trying to move the need uh the
[09:43] needle a bit uh towards um ease of use
[09:47] so we try to make it easier for also
[09:51] people who don't have extensive
[09:54] knowledge in in Bitcoin to start their
[09:56] note um to get some liquidity with their
[09:59] note but yeah um it's like I said
[10:02] there's a long way to go on top of that
[10:06] I guess there are a lot of developments
[10:08] around Fint ecash and these kind of
[10:11] things yeah I guess it's it's split
[10:14] between these these um also there are
[10:17] obviously some some other um proposals
[10:21] which would need Bitcoin soft fors at
[10:24] least um but I guess um they are still a
[10:28] few years out before we can actually
[10:32] yeah think about even using them um so I
[10:35] guess we have to work with what we have
[10:37] right now and I think there is also um a
[10:40] lot of room for improvement for making
[10:43] it more efficient and yeah I guess that
[10:46] will will be fine during the next five
[10:49] uh years I guess is it do you feel like
[10:53] it's uh an a development that could go
[10:56] or should go faster or is it already
[10:59] like is the pace kind of kind of good
[11:01] that that that we have I mean from a
[11:04] user perspective you would always say
[11:07] yeah I want it I want everything now
[11:09] right um but Bitcoin um derives its
[11:13] strength also from not being changed
[11:16] easily right so um I guess it's it's
[11:20] obvious that at least this layer moves
[11:23] very slow and on top of that I see quite
[11:27] some developments if you just look at at
[11:30] cashew or fedin I mean these projects I
[11:33] don't even know did they exist a year
[11:35] ago and they still they already seem to
[11:39] have some traction um but also self
[11:42] custodial lightning is um yeah has a lot
[11:45] of room to grow basically I
[11:48] think absolutely yeah it's it's it's
[11:50] super interesting for me when we when we
[11:52] look at all those
[11:54] interesting uh developments that we have
[11:56] in Bitcoin and there are so many
[11:59] different applications coming out
[12:01] different uh um wallets and and things
[12:04] use cases that we can use actually are
[12:07] coming out so it's quite nice but the
[12:10] the thing that I always see and I saw
[12:12] that development with Nostra actually
[12:14] where like one year ago uh I locked in
[12:17] and I was like kind of dissatisfied with
[12:19] everything I was like oh like that
[12:21] there's a long way to go for for people
[12:24] that had don't have a strong incentive
[12:26] to to join here like it's it's away from
[12:29] like a I don't know Twitter or YouTube
[12:33] onboarding uh and now and that's why I
[12:36] did not go anything big on on Nostra
[12:39] like a year ago uh and that's why I also
[12:43] lost my private keys on Nostra uh with
[12:46] my old account that's why I had to make
[12:47] a whole new one like a month or one and
[12:49] a half months ago uh and now the thing
[12:53] is already so much better like it it
[12:55] improved like 3 4X uh for me it was a
[12:59] abnormal how how good it got and I hope
[13:03] that just continues with every
[13:06] application with every uh thing we're
[13:08] doing in Bitcoin and that's why I always
[13:11] like to talk with with people that
[13:12] actually build something I think it's
[13:15] super cool that now with these
[13:17] developments we we can just try out
[13:20] different things right and the market
[13:22] will tell us what what is working what
[13:25] users want basically um and I think
[13:28] that's super exciting whether that's a
[13:30] future where most things are done self
[13:33] custodia with lightning or with ecash or
[13:37] I don't know some other future
[13:38] technology I mean we cannot know now but
[13:42] um we are striving to improve it uh
[13:44] basically every day yeah and I hope it's
[13:47] self custodial uh I hope that people are
[13:51] not too lazy and just like put
[13:52] everything on a on a Bitcoin Bank yeah I
[13:56] mean uh it's a very controversial top
[13:59] um but it I think it also depends a lot
[14:03] on on your situation um like will you
[14:09] honestly will you start off um directly
[14:12] self- custodial I think for most people
[14:14] that's just not realistic so I see it as
[14:17] kind of a path um where you start off
[14:20] with something and as you reach certain
[14:23] amounts or uh gain more knowledge want
[14:26] to go self- custodial Maybe
[14:29] um then then you then you have options
[14:32] right and that's the key part I think
[14:35] did you start uh with with self custody
[14:38] or like how how did you acquire your
[14:40] first bits and how long did it take to
[14:42] get on self
[14:43] custody um I mean I did some very early
[14:47] experiments I remember setting up a a
[14:50] casa note I think which was years back
[14:53] but I think I had a similar experience
[14:56] like you had with Noster it was just a a
[14:59] huge struggle a few years back and now
[15:01] that I see all of these options um yeah
[15:05] I think there is a a bright future ahead
[15:08] um if you kind of extrapolate this
[15:11] development during the last years or
[15:13] five more years I think it will be a lot
[15:16] lot easier um to to run these things
[15:19] absolutely yeah it's it's uh that that's
[15:22] c yeah um how satisfied are you with the
[15:27] overall user experience with the ux of
[15:30] of of Bitcoin right now as you said like
[15:33] it was really bad like U maybe like five
[15:36] 10 years back and and uh it it feels
[15:39] like it's gets better but it also
[15:41] depends on where you
[15:43] look yeah I mean we also have quite some
[15:47] insights because um yeah we we offer
[15:51] basically live chat support So users can
[15:54] easily reach us and reach out to us if
[15:58] they have questions and that's also a
[16:00] really nice feedback Channel I I feel
[16:03] like
[16:04] because sometimes you're also just
[16:08] assuming too many things so if you work
[16:10] in in some toping a topic for for years
[16:15] you kind of get some blind spots and
[16:17] then suddenly people for instance uh
[16:20] come in um they want to buy an inbound
[16:24] uh Channel and they wonder why can't
[16:27] they pay with their cryto crypto.com
[16:29] wallet for instance which only supports
[16:32] onchain right and yeah there yeah there
[16:37] are a lot of ux hurdles I feel like
[16:41] and um a lot of things to be improved um
[16:46] but also there are ways to do so so for
[16:49] instance for this one um you could try
[16:54] look at bip 21 which kind of tries to
[16:57] unify Bitcoin payments between Bitcoin
[17:00] and lightning um so you just have one QR
[17:03] code and the user um doesn't necessarily
[17:06] need to know uh with whether they are
[17:10] paying with with onchain or lightning I
[17:13] think a lot of these things might be
[17:15] abstracted away hopefully uh in the
[17:17] future so users don't need to exactly
[17:21] know what's going on under the hood
[17:24] currently I feel like it's still a bit
[17:26] hard to hide these things um completely
[17:30] because if something goes wrong um yeah
[17:33] it's super helpful for the user to at
[17:35] least have some understanding of of how
[17:38] these things work beneath the surface
[17:40] and that they need channels and stuff
[17:43] like that yeah what is bit
[17:46] 21 uh bip uh it's a Bitcoin not bit yeah
[17:51] um Bitcoin Improvement proposal 21 um
[17:54] it's unified QR codes for Bitcoin
[17:57] payments for instance oh I understood
[17:59] bit 21 I was like is there like app out
[18:01] there that yeah of course the B 21 yeah
[18:06] yeah maybe for uh sorry go ahead yeah I
[18:11] just wanted to say and like that I guess
[18:14] there are a lot of other um improvements
[18:17] that could be made uh also around
[18:19] Channel management automating things so
[18:24] I feel like this in uh this channel
[18:26] management is uh what people struggle a
[18:29] lot with um and they don't really care
[18:33] about it because it's also an unknown
[18:36] concept maybe so there are also some
[18:40] ideas to automate certain things where
[18:43] you would uh maybe just Define some
[18:47] thresholds and then some swaps could
[18:49] happen so you always have inbound
[18:51] liquidity or stuff like that I think
[18:53] that's super interesting to think about
[18:55] these things as in combination maybe
[18:58] with with liquid um there are a lot of
[19:01] interesting ideas to to explore yeah I
[19:05] love it I love it really cool um I
[19:07] always want to be aware of maybe new
[19:09] people or not tech people are in there
[19:13] what is a bip the Bitcoin Improvement
[19:16] what you already said uh and and and
[19:20] what is a specific pip like pip 21 what
[19:23] does that mean yeah bip 21 tries to
[19:26] Define how wallets um can advertise
[19:30] payments to their users so let's say you
[19:33] go on a website and you want to pay for
[19:35] a product what you usually uh end up
[19:38] seeing is a QR code and often times if
[19:42] they provide or offer lightning um you
[19:46] would be able to switch between the two
[19:48] but that also means um the user needs to
[19:51] know which one to choose and if you're a
[19:54] new user um yeah most most don't exactly
[19:58] understand understand what the
[19:59] difference is exactly and by combining
[20:03] these two options into basically one Q
[20:05] code and just advertising both um the
[20:09] sending wallet can then uh decide on
[20:12] which to use um they could also add
[20:15] certain let's say thresholds or based on
[20:18] the fee environment to automatically
[20:21] pick the cheaper option for instance and
[20:23] stuff like that um that's basically bip
[20:27] 21 in a nutal would see ah nice nice
[20:31] nice yeah it's it's it's really cool uh
[20:35] to to to see that uh Bitcoin is
[20:38] developed and is is is coming uh along
[20:41] especially all the things around Bitcoin
[20:44] likeit bip is for for that but uh for
[20:47] for the ecosystem on Layer Two for layer
[20:49] three and other stuff like that it's
[20:50] really important that we uh develop
[20:52] those things uh
[20:55] another maybe question I should have
[20:58] started with but but uh what is Albi and
[21:00] what are you doing at Albi so yeah at
[21:04] Albi um we try to to work on the future
[21:08] uh of lightning of Bitcoin payments and
[21:11] making them accessible for everyday uh
[21:15] people basically um we've started off
[21:19] several years ago with the browser
[21:22] extension uh which is probably still the
[21:24] most downloaded or well-known product uh
[21:28] we offer and the browser
[21:30] extension um allows you to do two things
[21:34] it's it's first of all it's a lightning
[21:37] wallet you can connect it to um your own
[21:40] note and second um it's your nostal key
[21:44] store so it allows you to securely use
[21:47] web apps Noster web apps um and sign
[21:51] those events for you yeah I would say
[21:54] that's the the two things and during the
[21:56] last um let's say several months um we
[22:00] have uh
[22:01] developed uh two or released two two new
[22:05] products which is ibub and albo um they
[22:09] they kind of work very well together um
[22:12] so ALB Hub is your self custodial uh
[22:15] lightning wallet that runs everywhere
[22:18] you can run it on your Raspberry Pi on
[22:20] your Stop n on your
[22:22] umbrell um we also offer hosted options
[22:26] um in case you don't have or or want to
[22:29] run a device at
[22:30] home um and with Alo you can uh
[22:34] perfectly use this thing uh while you're
[22:37] on the go um so it's a mobile app
[22:39] allowing you to connect and use your
[22:41] lightning no node while you're uh on the
[22:45] go and pay for products um I don't know
[22:50] at conferences wherever you are uh if
[22:52] you're able to buy Bitcoin uh able to
[22:55] buy coffee for Bitcoin at your place
[22:58] you're probably lucky um yeah but that's
[23:01] the overall
[23:03] idea yeah it's uh it's I have a local
[23:08] Bitcoin meet up in Vienna every month
[23:10] and there they accept Bitcoin and the
[23:13] restaurant owner is actually like a real
[23:15] Bitcoin and he's involved in the
[23:16] community he wants also to do Bitcoin
[23:18] videos like he really wants to position
[23:20] also his restaurant as a Bitcoin
[23:21] restaurant so that's amazing to have
[23:24] that uh because obviously he accepts
[23:27] Bitcoin yeah uh that it's it's quite
[23:30] amazing that uh like a year ago I didn't
[23:33] spend any Bitcoin and now I spend it
[23:36] monthly and also get paid in Bitcoin uh
[23:39] most of my income actually so like the
[23:42] the ecosystem uh for me is really
[23:45] developing now uh as I use it also so
[23:47] much and uh that that's a that's a great
[23:50] experience and I think we we've come all
[23:52] a long way but we have a very long way
[23:54] to go exactly that's how I see it as
[23:57] well yeah
[23:59] absolutely perfect then uh what is uh
[24:02] the what what do you see as the biggest
[24:04] challenge like the the long way to go
[24:07] still like what what what is like the
[24:09] the the big challenges that we we might
[24:11] face in the Bitcoin development future
[24:14] that's a a broad topic I guess
[24:18] um yeah I mean scaling scaling is one
[24:21] point if if all of the uh yeah people
[24:26] would discover Bitcoin uh at once we
[24:29] would certainly have a problem um so
[24:32] there needs to be something I guess some
[24:35] years out um if we don't want to uh go
[24:39] to custody for most of users other than
[24:42] that yeah sorry I think we would have a
[24:45] lot of problems if that's what I always
[24:47] say like I don't want Bitcoin to grow
[24:49] too fast because first of all that which
[24:52] means that would mean the feeld system
[24:55] completely wrecks and and all your
[24:58] neighbors all your family all your loved
[25:00] ones are in big trouble so it's like uh
[25:03] uh actually something that you don't
[25:05] wish for the world that Bitcoin I don't
[25:07] know goes next year to to$ 10 million
[25:10] because this means the Fe system is
[25:12] really screwed uh and the second part is
[25:16] like is Bitcoin ready for for like four
[25:19] billion people but yeah uh I'm I'm not
[25:23] sure
[25:24] so I think it just takes longer than
[25:28] most people think like also like we
[25:33] bitcoiners we often tend to to say or or
[25:36] think that the people just don't
[25:39] understand it while they would need it
[25:41] right um we see kind of their money um
[25:45] depreciating in value and want to help
[25:47] them get get them onboarded but I think
[25:52] um it's if you if you have a look at
[25:55] Argentina or other places where they had
[25:58] like like really bad inflation and how
[26:00] people still manage to kind of get along
[26:04] um and then Zoom back to Europe or the
[26:07] us wherever um where inflation is kind
[26:11] of okay and most people yeah they notice
[26:14] it but it's not not that worse um I
[26:18] think it takes a long time um for people
[26:21] to
[26:22] really understand where where these
[26:25] things are coming from and then also
[26:27] have the mental flexibility to kind of
[26:30] get on this new standard and and try to
[26:34] learn be open about it because I feel a
[26:37] lot of people just immediately go into
[26:41] kind of a defensive I think the net I
[26:43] think we often underestimate the network
[26:46] effect of Fiat like like like Fiat has a
[26:49] very strong Network effect because you
[26:53] see it everywhere with the unit of
[26:55] account everyone has a feeld like not
[26:58] everyone has a fat wallet because there
[27:00] are a lot of unbanked people but like
[27:02] especially in the Western countries they
[27:03] all have like feat wallets or like bank
[27:06] accounts uh and this this network effect
[27:09] and this deep ingrained uh like dollars
[27:13] Euros whatever your currency that's your
[27:16] that's your money people think that's
[27:18] that's a money uh I think that it takes
[27:22] a long time to get to get over that and
[27:24] even Bitcoin as uh even myself I use
[27:28] Euro as a unit of account like I set my
[27:31] prices for my Partnerships uh in Euros I
[27:35] think in Euros I when I do bookkeeping
[27:38] for my company I have to do Euros so
[27:40] like my my brain is still in Euros uh
[27:43] even though my treasury like I'm 100% in
[27:46] Bitcoin so that helps but we have a long
[27:50] way to go and and it's not it's not a
[27:53] quick like it also took me uh three
[27:56] years to get over Bitcoin is a scam and
[27:59] then one year from okay Bitcoin might be
[28:01] something to I'm all in Bitcoin so like
[28:04] from zero to 100 in four years I think
[28:07] that's kind of an a realistic uh
[28:09] timeline for people to like okay the
[28:12] first time they actually ackowledge and
[28:15] like think about Bitcoin to like till
[28:17] they actually are on a Bitcoin standard
[28:20] uh but I love that already those
[28:22] developments are coming in those
[28:24] directions yeah definitely yeah yeah um
[28:29] the most important uh thing I think is
[28:32] um that that they have some curiosity
[28:35] otherwise you you will have a very hard
[28:38] time um convincing anybody right
[28:42] is what do you think is the the the main
[28:45] driver for I asked that uh recently on
[28:48] my YouTube Community what is the main
[28:51] driver that that you that got you into
[28:54] Bitcoin that's like like this I want to
[28:57] store my weth I want to increase my
[28:59] wealth uh I want to be more freedom I I
[29:03] want to have more freedom and then there
[29:05] are other reasons smaller reasons for
[29:07] that like what do you think is the the
[29:09] main reason uh people come in and was
[29:12] this also then your
[29:13] reason um I guess it's Fiat
[29:18] games for the most part um as well as
[29:22] for all people as it was initially for
[29:25] me I think um because you just look at
[29:28] something that goes up in value
[29:31] constantly and that that might lead you
[29:34] to read a book or two if you're really
[29:36] interested uh in that and yeah then then
[29:40] you discover other parts uh like you
[29:43] said Freedom or privacy or censorship
[29:46] resistance or yeah I guess it depends a
[29:50] lot on on what your current situation is
[29:53] it might be completely different in you
[29:55] if you live in like some country in some
[29:59] I don't know with some totalitarian
[30:01] regime I think most people are
[30:03] interested in in fat gain initially
[30:06] that's also why those shitcoins work I
[30:09] guess I partnered up with coin vigilante
[30:13] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[30:16] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[30:19] look at that beauty I love it so much
[30:22] coin vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin
[30:25] watch that's the perfect subtle elent
[30:28] way to go out there and show that you
[30:30] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:34] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[30:37] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:39] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:42] collections you have the date of the
[30:44] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[30:48] and of course also the block height and
[30:50] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[30:54] level of detail they put in in this
[30:56] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:59] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:02] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:04] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:08] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:10] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:12] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[31:15] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[31:18] in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:20] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:22] the bit box it's super secure it's
[31:24] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[31:26] for a friend who has still the Bitcoin
[31:29] on an exchange and you can get a 5%
[31:32] discount with the code Robin at the

[31:58] where you live you even want to have a
[32:00] plan B a citizenship where you can move

[32:19] level up your
[32:21] sovereignty it's uh I I always love to
[32:25] to uh show this website when we talk
[32:28] about Fiat gains of price because it's
[32:31] like everything is
[32:33] red switch your brain to bitcoin and now
[32:37] we actually at a a period of like
[32:39] actually everything is red uh and and
[32:42] it's like you you can hardly see some
[32:45] small greens things in there and it's
[32:47] really hard to to to pick them out and
[32:50] it's it's with everything uh like with
[32:53] precious metals with commodities with
[32:55] Equity markets with Bond markets with
[32:58] you just have to wait long enough then
[33:00] everything will be read forever
[33:02] absolutely yeah really great uh but yeah
[33:05] but coming back to the to the the
[33:09] question from that we previously
[33:12] discussed of like the challenges that
[33:13] you see with with scaling um so like
[33:17] that's that's for you like right now
[33:19] obviously what in scaling do you think
[33:21] is is is the hard part like obviously
[33:24] right now we have so not a lot of people
[33:28] in Bitcoin actually using it and most
[33:30] people that are in Bitcoin right now
[33:32] they they just hold it on exchanges they
[33:35] hold it on a and on a hardware wallet
[33:37] they hold it on some self custody
[33:39] solution um and the people that actually
[33:42] transacted it and actually do something
[33:44] using Bitcoin is is very small what
[33:47] happens if that number of people
[33:50] actually like increases a lot like all
[33:53] of the sudden like I don't know half a
[33:55] billion people uh want to transact in in
[33:58] Bitcoin on a regular basis yeah I mean
[34:02] if you say half a billion that's that's
[34:04] really a lot um I guess the um yeah the
[34:09] block space uh is too limited to to
[34:13] onboard half a billion people in a self
[34:15] custodial way at least right now um
[34:19] that's just a fact I think um if you
[34:22] don't want to to wait for years at least
[34:25] um yeah um so so like you said um I I
[34:30] guess there are a lot of options
[34:32] obviously um you can debate around B
[34:35] scaling Bitcoin with custodial things
[34:38] still is Bitcoin um because obviously
[34:41] there is the argument that if you use B
[34:44] uh Bitcoin in a custodial way it loses
[34:46] almost all of its
[34:48] property uh properties that that makes
[34:51] it unique but I guess if tomorrow uh a
[34:55] half a billion people would would like
[34:57] to join the lightning Network um I guess
[35:00] uh that's currently the only way to do
[35:03] it over custodial Services um and that's
[35:06] also I guess one of the biggest
[35:08] challenges um or dangers maybe um for
[35:12] lightning in general that we We should
[35:15] strive to um it's okay if some people
[35:18] use custodial Services I'm I'm fine with
[35:21] that everybody should do what they want
[35:23] but we we should um still try to to make
[35:27] H uh yeah kind of one big system and not
[35:31] tear them apart in in like some you know
[35:35] some custodial kyc kind of Bitcoin and
[35:38] and then is there the self custodial
[35:41] Bitcoin um I guess that that would be
[35:44] very bad yeah it's it's it's interesting
[35:48] when we think about that tearing apart
[35:51] uh I remember I don't even know his name
[35:54] there was someone on the Bitcoin
[35:55] conference who said uh uh ESG Bitcoin
[35:59] will be worth more than other Bitcoin
[36:01] yeah who was that I I I've read it as
[36:06] well but I cannot remember oh Kevin o
[36:09] Kevin o was it and I think I think
[36:14] that's that's just
[36:16] stupid yeah that that that that that
[36:20] will not happen at all like like if you
[36:24] you can even you can not not even prove
[36:26] at some point
[36:28] like where a Bitcoin 100% comes from uh
[36:31] like like
[36:33] there that's on but that was just on my
[36:36] my head right now when you said tearing
[36:38] apart so hopefully we come to the that
[36:41] um point where everything is uh kind of
[36:44] one system I mean it's it's always like
[36:46] this protocol uh and even if there are
[36:49] CIA Solutions you can always like switch
[36:53] to S castal Solutions or at least we
[36:55] have to agree on on one protocol and
[36:59] then we can interact with different apps
[37:01] and like I can use a different app you
[37:03] can use a different app and we can
[37:04] interact with that and that's the true
[37:06] power right that that it doesn't matter
[37:10] where this thing actually runs yeah you
[37:12] can just transact peer-to peer if you
[37:15] want to yeah yeah that's that that's
[37:18] very true what are what are your
[37:19] thoughts on um uh on Nostra actually oh
[37:24] man uh I just went uh off x uh I guess
[37:29] two weeks ago so I paused or I don't
[37:33] know disabled my account um there
[37:36] because I wanted to throw myself a
[37:38] little bit more I was always lurking
[37:40] around there and you know reading stuff
[37:43] and I wanted to dive in a bit deeper um
[37:47] and so yeah I love it um I really have
[37:50] to say um also compared to a year ago um
[37:54] a lot of things have changed there is a
[37:56] lot of interesting content on there for
[37:59] me it's mostly Bitcoin or Bitcoin
[38:02] development related things um so a lot
[38:05] of nostal devs um I don't know Bitcoin
[38:09] devs um posting interesting stuff um but
[38:13] also some personal connections um so I
[38:16] just onboarded my my wife a week ago and
[38:20] threw her into into this new thing um
[38:25] and yeah we're just discovering it
[38:28] together I guess so you are only on
[38:32] Nostra right now with social media yeah
[38:35] yeah that's that's a GU uh that's a a
[38:39] brave step yeah well there there have
[38:42] been people before me who who did that
[38:45] right also with quite some followings um
[38:48] and it's also I mean it depends right I
[38:51] I don't um depend on any income or reach
[38:55] or or whatnot on on Twitter so that
[38:58] might not work for everyone but if you
[39:01] have the option to do so I think you
[39:05] know you you have what is the saying um
[39:10] do what you want to see in the world
[39:12] kind of and yeah if you put your energy
[39:15] into this open um decentralized Network
[39:18] it's kind you kind of support um with
[39:21] every post and you you support this
[39:23] ecosystem with every set with yeah
[39:27] that's but but also as a consumer you're
[39:30] not on YouTube not on other any other
[39:32] social media platform just to to consume
[39:35] no uh currently currently not sometimes
[39:38] I watch some YouTube videos obviously
[39:41] but I don't use it as a social media or
[39:44] something yeah yeah it's
[39:47] uh I I I watch too much YouTube I
[39:51] think you end up in the in the short uh
[39:55] reals or well well no no I watch actual
[39:59] like uh videos uh like ad like I I
[40:03] usually I really try to avoid those Doom
[40:07] scrolling things like where you just
[40:09] like scroll on Instagram reals YouTube
[40:12] shorts Tik Tok Twitter also has it now
[40:15] like don't they don't have a name for it
[40:18] the incentive of these apps to maximize
[40:21] the time you spent there yeah absolutely
[40:23] but I don't like it and uh I hope I hope
[40:27] you YouTube stays like that where you
[40:28] can really like separate those two
[40:30] things but I see more and more coming
[40:32] together things I even get the the
[40:35] YouTube shorts now on the TV as a
[40:36] suggestion I'm like who wants to watch
[40:38] the Youtube shorts on on a TV like
[40:40] that's that seems
[40:43] ridiculous yeah I mean yeah yeah I I
[40:47] also don't like them yeah your brain
[40:49] feels like smashed after after you after
[40:53] you watch them for like 15 minutes so
[40:57] I'm done yeah doesn't make me feel good
[41:01] yeah but I actually really enjoy
[41:04] YouTubers and education platform uh on
[41:06] the one side like you have the one two
[41:09] three four five hour podcast and I just
[41:11] like to have the visual also I mean
[41:13] Spotify also has it now uh with the
[41:15] visual but I still from the ux prefer
[41:19] YouTube uh but also I can try just like
[41:22] 15 20 minutes videos where you dive
[41:24] deeper into some topic like like I I
[41:28] didn't knew anything about it now I know
[41:30] a little bit about it so I I really do
[41:32] like it and I would love to see a Nostra
[41:35] app just like copying YouTube just like
[41:38] straight out like the interface just
[41:40] like call it NOS tube I don't know how
[41:43] you call it I I think it's called flare
[41:46] Pop um so flare pop yeah flare. poop um
[41:52] I don't know how much development uh is
[41:55] going on right now but I think that was
[41:59] the the overall idea sorry uh I was
[42:02] muted uh I will just open it here so
[42:05] people can see it also let me do that so
[42:10] so that's that's flare pu yeah and it's
[42:15] basic like what you said um it's
[42:17] basically a YouTube Noster client yeah I
[42:22] I don't know about the quality of the
[42:24] content to be honest but the inter face
[42:27] more Le more or less looks looks
[42:30] familiar right it looks very familiar
[42:32] yeah a little weird is that there's
[42:34] everywhere zero
[42:37] fuse yeah I guess it's not that easy to
[42:40] count fuse but maybe like yeah could
[42:44] also be just some random posts by Bots
[42:48] or I don't know
[42:50] looks looks a bit strange yeah but I I I
[42:53] love that those options are there and
[42:56] and people are working on
[42:58] and it's not so important that it's like
[43:01] right now here and it's we are taking
[43:03] over the world right now but it it's
[43:06] just like we have to move in that
[43:07] direction and it also gives a pressure
[43:10] on all the other platforms because if
[43:12] there's a really nice YouTube
[43:14] application on Nostra which people are
[43:18] liking to upload people are liking to
[43:20] watch and there's like a solid user base
[43:23] on there even if it's way smaller than
[43:24] on YouTube this puts you YouTube uh in a
[43:28] very tough spot where when they try to
[43:30] censor something or do some some other
[43:33] things uh people get pissed off because
[43:36] because all of the sudden their favorite
[43:38] Creator is no longer there the account
[43:40] get deleted people notice that
[43:42] especially if they watch someone on a
[43:44] regular or even daily basis all of the
[43:46] sudden this guy is not there anymore
[43:49] where did he go uh and then on the new
[43:52] platforms they don't do that so this
[43:54] this puts kind of pressure on YouTube
[43:57] but also on a and all the Facebook
[43:59] platforms to like okay there is an
[44:01] alternative without an alternative they
[44:02] can just do whatever they want and with
[44:04] an alternative that's my hope they get a
[44:08] little pressure at least yeah yeah
[44:10] definitely um that's definitely
[44:12] something to hope for um but I guess a
[44:15] lot of people don't care about that
[44:18] until um they are affected right I I
[44:22] guess you have to Once live through uh a
[44:25] platform uh de platforming you uh to
[44:29] even understand why you would uh care
[44:32] about such things maybe yeah yeah and uh
[44:36] it's it's it's a it's a broad topic the
[44:38] the Deep platforming because YouTube uh
[44:41] already klicked out a lot of bitcoiners
[44:44] but the almost all of them especially
[44:47] the bigger ones all came back like it
[44:49] was like oh it's a softer thing like few
[44:51] weeks or a few days uh back uh like it
[44:55] was with simply Bitcoin the the the same
[44:58] story uh I think they came back after a
[45:00] week or something like that and and I
[45:03] talked with some bigger YouTub in German
[45:05] space Roman Ray here and yeah he
[45:08] basically told me his account is now
[45:10] almost 200k on on on YouTube like really
[45:13] big he's the biggest one in the German
[45:14] market and he basically told me um yeah
[45:18] my account got taken down two times
[45:21] already uh and he talks with YouTube
[45:24] around that and it's just like
[45:27] like in the first decisions there's no
[45:29] human interactions at least that's what
[45:31] YouTube is saying so it's also
[45:33] interesting then how would a platform
[45:37] that big work on Nostra like how would
[45:41] that work uh how can you choose your own
[45:43] algorithms how do you envision how do
[45:45] you see uh how how do you prevent spams
[45:48] and Bots and and and and try to have a
[45:51] clean platform um and uh not have uh
[45:56] this the the same uh thing that you have
[45:59] in the in the basically on the on the
[46:02] centralized platforms yeah I mean it's
[46:04] definitely Messier on nost right but
[46:07] that's the thing um with
[46:09] decentralization yeah I guess um there
[46:13] is yeah it's just a different way of of
[46:17] running such it's not a platform right
[46:21] it's a different way of running your
[46:23] social media I guess do you think there
[46:26] is a fair a chance that Nostra or a
[46:30] similar protocol like if let's just like
[46:33] say a decentralized social media
[46:35] protocol once will be the main thing and
[46:40] you can always go from one client to
[46:42] another client and you you have this
[46:44] nost the future or is that
[46:47] something uh that that will not happen
[46:49] if it will not happen would be
[46:51] interesting to know like what what might
[46:52] be the limitations I guess it
[46:55] depends on a long enough T time scale uh
[46:59] I would think that's definitely
[47:02] something that can happen right now uh I
[47:05] think the network effects also of the
[47:08] like you you touched before on the
[47:10] network effects of Fiat right I think
[47:13] it's very similar uh here um now we have
[47:17] like very big Network effects on YouTube
[47:19] on Facebook and Instagram and whatnot so
[47:23] it makes it very hard for people to do
[47:27] switch right but the cool thing with
[47:29] nost I guess is you can just see it as
[47:32] an
[47:32] additional thing that you maintain maybe
[47:36] maybe you do not put in the same amount
[47:38] of work like you do in in other um but
[47:43] in my experience the the conversations
[47:46] on Noster are like a lot
[47:50] more valuable um let's say it's it's
[47:55] like yeah it it's I had some super nice
[47:59] conversations everyone was super helpful
[48:03] um overall the spirit is very positive I
[48:06] would say I enjoy that currently yeah
[48:11] yeah I I also have this experience and
[48:16] we talked in the beginning um uh how how
[48:20] much revenue of of mine is coming from
[48:23] the value for value and there's one
[48:25] thing I forgot about that because
[48:26] currently value for value is actually
[48:29] only possible so really on on Fountain
[48:32] Okay and like my YouTube audience if my
[48:36] YouTube audience is that big my podcast
[48:39] audience is like maybe that okay and
[48:41] from that the fountain is only the third
[48:45] or the fourth biggest platform like it's
[48:47] that small so maybe uh I should look at
[48:51] like uh per listener po per audience
[48:54] member the revenue States uh that would
[48:58] uh statistics that that would be maybe
[49:00] an interesting one that just came to my
[49:02] mind because when you look at like how
[49:05] much per I don't know minute by someone
[49:08] watched you actually earn uh versus from
[49:12] from the traditional thing uh then you
[49:14] can way better see where where it's
[49:17] going I just wanted to to add that from
[49:20] our conversation that's that's an
[49:22] interesting thought if you if you have
[49:24] these numbers available I would be very
[49:26] interested uh to to see uh that also
[49:31] like for me this value for Value thing I
[49:34] think it's super cool but it puts this
[49:37] mental cost on myself to choose how much
[49:41] I want to support Someone So within
[49:44] certain Al products you will see a lot
[49:47] of like presets where you can just
[49:50] donate uh a th000 5,000 or 10,000 just
[49:54] to make it a little bit easier as stupid
[49:58] as that might sound but also for
[50:00] Fountain do you choose to stream 10 SS
[50:02] per minute 100 a th000 even more um it's
[50:06] it's not that easy to do these
[50:09] calculations at least for me so it would
[50:12] be super interesting for me to um have a
[50:14] number how much you actually uh would
[50:18] need to uh stream with Fountain to equal
[50:23] uh your earnings in like YouTube or
[50:27] something on a per listener basis I
[50:30] think
[50:31] that's that would be super interesting
[50:34] yeah I if it's easy I will I will do it
[50:37] but I probably have to extract some data
[50:40] yeah okay so many different but I will
[50:42] try it like I will try it you just try
[50:45] it for YouTube if it's the most easy
[50:47] thing to calculate some per listener
[50:50] revenue or something um per minute
[50:54] because the
[50:57] it's it's basically ad Revenue versus
[50:59] value for Value because the sponsors are
[51:01] anyways there uh no no matter if it's on
[51:06] on a on a fountain app or YouTube
[51:09] because the yeah podcasts of the the ads
[51:12] are always there uh but yeah it's the ad
[51:14] revenue of YouTube and it's also it's
[51:17] interesting always when a a video of
[51:20] mine really blows up and gets like over
[51:23] 20,000 or maybe over 30,000 views on
[51:26] YouTube
[51:27] uh then only I get complaints about the
[51:30] too many ads on YouTube uh because I let
[51:36] YouTube choose how many ads they do like
[51:38] I I just go with the default setting of
[51:41] like YouTube you do it because otherwise
[51:43] I have extra work um and that's probably
[51:47] how they want it to be uh and then I
[51:50] just like choose it and I think the more
[51:52] successful video guyss I think they also
[51:54] put more in there
[51:57] I I have that weird notion because uh
[52:00] nobody ever complained about a lower
[52:04] performing video that there are too many
[52:06] ads and almost almost every time a video
[52:11] really goes good someone is like oh
[52:13] there's so many ads in there I'm like Ah
[52:15] that's YouTube sorry speaking about
[52:18] incentives right yeah that's true yeah
[52:22] it's also I don't know maybe YouTube
[52:24] pushes then the video more because they
[52:26] can
[52:27] G make more Revenue with that one video
[52:29] right absolutely about uh maybe the last
[52:33] topic because we are uh streaming
[52:35] towards the one hour already um last
[52:38] topic for today how is how do you see I
[52:42] don't know how much Insight you have in
[52:43] the topic but how how do you see the
[52:45] funding of Bitcoin development lightning
[52:49] development
[52:51] um is that something where like okay um
[52:55] that's concerning or like it's it's it's
[52:58] it's fine like how do you see uh funding
[53:00] in total in
[53:03] overall yeah I mean there there are
[53:06] different um things going on I would say
[53:09] Obviously there is the traditional
[53:12] Venture Capital space um which you will
[53:15] read about quite often um that someone
[53:19] uh did a new round and and stuff so
[53:22] there is that that's yeah I guess a good
[53:25] thing um the market will decide um what
[53:30] products uh people are willing to pay
[53:33] for and and which they are not um but
[53:36] also there are very cool initiatives by
[53:40] uh open sets for instance so also I
[53:44] guess a lot of nosto development um is
[53:47] funded by them um and they collect uh
[53:51] funds from I guess they have some
[53:53] companies um backing them but also
[53:55] individuals
[53:57] um and they try to they have a board and
[54:00] try to redistribute this These funds to
[54:03] different um Noster and Bitcoin
[54:06] projects um very much I guess focusing
[54:09] around uh self custody privacy uh and
[54:14] and other things um that yeah might or
[54:19] might not be that well funded uh with
[54:22] with Rees so I guess they they uh can
[54:26] kind of do a good job in um also funding
[54:30] like more groundwork let's say you know
[54:34] like building out some very basic things
[54:37] that you cannot
[54:39] immediately yeah see where you would get
[54:42] rev you from so I guess um that's that's
[54:45] a cool thing and then there are also
[54:47] other organizations like the hrf which
[54:50] are also funding different projects I
[54:53] would say yeah um it's that's quite good
[54:57] I feel like um there are different
[55:00] sources and if you're really passionate
[55:03] about something and want to bring
[55:05] something forward um I guess you will
[55:08] find someone to to convince uh about
[55:11] your
[55:13] product I also have seen uh honestly a
[55:17] very generous uh Bitcoin Community like
[55:20] they they they really want to see
[55:23] Bitcoin succeed uh and they are willing
[55:25] to pay for that cause uh I mean I have
[55:29] not raised money at all uh but I heard a
[55:32] lot of stories and uh through those
[55:34] stories I saw how generous uh bitcoiners
[55:38] are and how willing they are like hey I
[55:41] would I I I I will take part of my
[55:46] Bitcoin and I will um um support Bitcoin
[55:51] with that and that's that's really good
[55:53] to see uh I think that's something that
[55:55] is very positive and very bullish sign
[55:58] also that uh big bitcoiners are willing
[56:02] uh to do that and are not like ah it's
[56:04] my Bitcoin someone else should pay like
[56:06] yeah 100% I can only agree yeah um it's
[56:10] kind of yeah it's if you put yourself
[56:14] into the shoes of a VC yeah um if you
[56:17] buy Bitcoin and just hold on to them for
[56:20] quite some time I guess you could make
[56:23] the case that it's very hard to
[56:25] outperform Bitcoin um as a startup
[56:28] probably but that being said um I I also
[56:31] feel like um a lot of people kind of
[56:35] want to get uh give back um want to see
[56:38] their idea or Bitcoin succeed and are
[56:42] also willing to contribute back which is
[56:45] which also makes me super bullish uh
[56:47] because these people also have their
[56:50] incentives aligned um they use Bitcoin
[56:53] they fund projects that they would want
[56:56] to to see in the world so that's super
[56:58] cool to see yeah absolutely really cool
[57:02] perfect we have um one question that I
[57:05] always ask my my guests before we have
[57:08] the endro te what can we learn from you
[57:11] besides Bitcoin besides Bitcoin um maybe
[57:15] how to to hold
[57:18] chicken so I'm a new um I just uh
[57:22] started a little you know very little
[57:25] farm with some chicken and stuff and I'm
[57:29] I'm enjoying this stuff a lot um I have
[57:31] now a lot of eggs um it's very different
[57:35] to bitcoin um but it's also super yeah a
[57:38] super good way to distract your mind a
[57:42] bit from Bitcoin if you're thinking
[57:44] about that all the time I love it uh uh
[57:48] chickens perfect then we come to our end
[57:51] routine where the previous guest is
[57:52] asking a question for the next guest
[57:53] without knowing who the next guest
[57:55] actually is uh and the question is what
[57:58] is the main takeway from Bitcoin you
[58:02] want everyone to know I guess it's uh
[58:05] Freedom money that's that's my uh kind
[58:08] of overall perspective on it um yeah and
[58:12] and why I also contribute my time
[58:16] towards
[58:17] Bitcoin oh yeah what did you do before
[58:19] did you do uh on uh normal software
[58:23] development or yeah yeah mhm exactly I I
[58:26] was a software development uh developer
[58:29] project manager back in my fat days um
[58:34] yeah and at one time I said okay let's
[58:37] let's take a year off and kind of try to
[58:41] to find something that uh I have passion
[58:45] uh for and yeah here we are in that year
[58:50] you you were already in Bitcoin or you
[58:53] got Bitcoin in that year uh I I mean I I
[58:57] read a lot about Bitcoin but I never
[59:00] actually you know developed something
[59:02] around it and during that year I visited
[59:05] several heatons um in different places
[59:09] got to know many people in the lightning
[59:11] and Bitcoin space and that was kind of
