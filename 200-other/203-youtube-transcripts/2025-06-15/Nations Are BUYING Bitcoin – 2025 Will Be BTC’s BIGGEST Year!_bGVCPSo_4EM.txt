[00:00] we will see taxes flowing towards mining
[00:03] companies they have an incentive because
[00:04] the system will become so big that we
[00:06] need to pay taxes as a community to make
[00:08] sure that Bitcoin will still work 2024
[00:12] we saw like the ETFs coming in we saw
[00:14] like options on ETFs and now 2025 States
[00:17] discussing a strategic Bitcoin Reserve I
[00:20] was like it's so cool to see because
[00:23] everything that we used to talk about
[00:25] that it's it's happening you know it's
[00:26] actually happening yeah I think it's
[00:28] necessary for the industry to grow
[00:30] bigger so I would say a real Bitcoin
[00:32] education company like for example me
[00:34] Premier Bitcoin needs to get bigger to
[00:36] see if Cycles in the future will be the
[00:38] same why Cycles are aren't the way they
[00:41] are and if we get that now and we can
[00:43] explain that to the youth or to the
[00:44] students then they can think of I think
[00:47] better Solutions if you look at other
[00:48] projects then you come to the conclusion
[00:50] that it doesn't make sense to not want
[00:52] to save in Bitcoin even if you hate
[00:54] Bitcoin but you're smart in finance then
[00:57] you should even have like just a little
[00:59] bit because you know you need to hatch
[01:00] yourself because what if you're wrong so
[01:02] it's always wise to have some Bitcoin
[01:05] from Financial Risk perspective I'm
[01:07] highly convinced that there isn't
[01:09] something that is better than Bitcoin at
[01:11] this
[01:12] [Music]
[01:15] moment the industry like it's it's
[01:18] growing so fast and and so slow at the
[01:21] same time so if I look at like we were
[01:25] in El Salvador like only two months ago
[01:27] you know it was two months ago but but
[01:30] if you look back at it it feels like it
[01:31] was like a year ago but it
[01:34] wasn't it actually feels like longer ago
[01:37] but it was like uh middle of November if
[01:39] I remember correctly yeah that's not
[01:42] long ago that's like it gets three
[01:45] months in like two weeks or something
[01:47] like that exactly so um like everything
[01:52] moves so fast and back then you know we
[01:54] were still sitting it I think where what
[01:57] was the it was a small small town or
[02:00] uh even where we went to the restaurant
[02:02] and we put like the the block clock on
[02:05] top of the on top of the balcony so we
[02:07] can see the few with the with the price
[02:09] going up to 95k or 96k we were like oh
[02:13] damn this is history in the making you
[02:14] know and a month later uh the Bitcoin
[02:17] price was at 100K I think and in
[02:19] December we even get the 100K in Euros
[02:21] so yeah especially with something like
[02:23] that happens it's it's the time to to
[02:27] put in the work especially in our field
[02:29] because we're uh depending
[02:33] on well yes like the price it it works
[02:36] like a marketing marketing campaign you
[02:38] know and then for us it's very easy to
[02:42] then reach out to schools and be like
[02:44] hey this is something that you really
[02:46] need to to look into because it's
[02:48] growing right now and it's growing
[02:50] really fast and because of the price
[02:52] they all are all like okay we need to we
[02:55] need to put in a bit of a bit more Tempo
[02:58] and uh come over over and give some
[03:00] lectures and then uh yeah then we'll
[03:02] we'll start from there so I'm currently
[03:05] searching oh I I found it
[03:08] actually I I found the picture uh that I
[03:11] made unfortunately I didn't do the
[03:13] picture with you I forgot the name of
[03:15] the guy that I made it um I took a
[03:18] picture of you oh you were the guy
[03:21] making the picture right
[03:23] yeah because you're standing next to
[03:25] yudi right exactly yes this this was
[03:28] some uh this was some moment yeah 90k
[03:30] and back then it was crazy that we hit
[03:33] 90k because uh we went up like 10 15K or
[03:37] something like that in like a matter of
[03:39] days or something like that I don't
[03:40] remember the exact thing but I I
[03:43] remember that I was in the plane from
[03:46] Vienna to Canada and it all already went
[03:50] up crazy and then from uh Canada again
[03:53] to Salvador the price again went up
[03:55] crazy and then in Salvador obviously uh
[03:58] we didn't like we hoped for the 100K in
[04:00] El Salvador to to have the party there
[04:02] but it it was
[04:05] unfortunately not as good that we had it
[04:07] in Salvador but a few weeks later we hit
[04:10] it then yeah but like if you think back
[04:14] it was such
[04:15] an yeah that's that's what most people
[04:18] have like the crypto space it grows so
[04:20] quick and everything that you do
[04:22] everything is so fast and if if you
[04:25] don't keep up with the pace then
[04:28] um I I think it's also good to not keep
[04:31] up with the pace because then you can
[04:32] stay sane and uh see what what's
[04:36] actually happening but it's also fun to
[04:38] keep up with the pace because then
[04:40] you're really experiencing how fast
[04:42] everything can go like for example we
[04:45] were discussing I don't know if you
[04:46] remember still but we were discussing
[04:49] how cool it would be if there was a
[04:52] possibility that maybe if in a good
[04:55] scenario Donald Trump would be president
[04:57] then we could see something like a
[04:59] Bitcoin strategic Reserve
[05:02] maybe and
[05:03] then the 20th of the 20th of January
[05:08] Donald Trump uh the inauguration was
[05:10] done and a few days later we see like
[05:13] tons of States I think right now the
[05:16] number is at 15
[05:17] states that have looked into um bills uh
[05:22] or set up bills even uh for strategic
[05:25] Bitcoin Reserve so that feels like so
[05:28] long ago but every is moving so
[05:31] quick but yeah how have your days been
[05:34] since El salador how was your experience
[05:37] um yeah it's it's since one and a half
[05:41] years or like one year and three months
[05:44] that I do the podcast now so and it's
[05:48] completely unreal and everything is
[05:52] growing faster than I expected
[05:53] everything is going way better than
[05:56] expected and uh it's also extremely
[05:59] different to what I was expecting um so
[06:03] I I I really enjoy it um and there's
[06:06] like this up phases and down phases uh
[06:09] in the up phases I'm like oh like
[06:11] everything is running amazing like I'm
[06:13] on top of the world but then the the
[06:15] down phas of like oh like nothing is
[06:17] working and and like everything is
[06:19] crashing down um but I think that's like
[06:22] quite normal uh like starting something
[06:25] new um but overall I'm just amazed every
[06:29] time I look back just a few months or
[06:31] like half a year I'm like that the
[06:34] development uh of the podcast the
[06:36] development of the Bitcoin space the
[06:38] development um that that we all kind of
[06:41] make in that space is just tremendous
[06:44] how fast and how uh great it it's going
[06:48] and that completely organically like I I
[06:51] didn't had any any starting Advantage
[06:56] like there was no um guy that I knew in
[07:00] the Bitcoin space that helped me out
[07:02] like that helped me out that I knew
[07:04] before like everyone I that is helping
[07:07] me out now is because I got to know that
[07:10] within with the podcast that's not like
[07:12] oh like I have an uncle that is like
[07:14] Larry La power Michael
[07:16] sailor I didn't had like something UNF
[07:19] like that uh I didn't had any startup uh
[07:22] experience I didn't had any capital I
[07:24] didn't had any investors any I didn't
[07:27] take any credits like I I just like went
[07:29] in here and like tried to do my best uh
[07:32] so from that perspective it's just
[07:35] unbelievable that it's going that fast
[07:37] and and also that good uh but yeah
[07:40] that's that that I think most people
[07:42] that watch this kind of like the they G
[07:44] like uh uh the the development of that
[07:47] um what I'm more interested in uh is
[07:51] what you doing currently in
[07:54] Bitcoin and what what you up to uh we
[07:57] talked briefly and El salvad
[08:00] um I know you're from the Netherlands
[08:02] you're
[08:03] doing Bitcoin education but what what
[08:06] exactly are you doing and and maybe then
[08:08] let's late later we can go to how you
[08:11] see the the Bitcoin world right
[08:13] now yeah um so the the short answer is
[08:18] that we do Bitcoin education and we've
[08:21] been doing it for I think it's over four
[08:23] years right
[08:24] now uh it was a while back like in I
[08:28] think it was 20
[08:30] 9 um when I really thought like man
[08:34] everything is so so complicated but it
[08:38] wasn't even complicated it was just
[08:40] complex so we needed to digest all the
[08:44] um yeah all the things that are like all
[08:47] the different concepts that are part of
[08:49] Bitcoin technology um and I say specific
[08:52] technology because everybody is always
[08:54] talking only about the coins that move
[08:56] on top of the specific technology that
[08:58] Bitcoin uses um which we also call uh
[09:01] Bitcoin or what we also call Bitcoin um
[09:05] but I thought it could be
[09:07] way way easier if people just get the
[09:10] concepts explained and then form A New
[09:13] Concept with all the different stuff
[09:14] that are like part of Bitcoin so we
[09:17] started explaining that in 2019 and then
[09:21] people were saying like oh you can
[09:23] explain it quite easily and as you can
[09:26] hear right now I do that in Dutch um
[09:29] because that's my mother tongue so I can
[09:30] use a lot of analogies that make sense
[09:32] to people and in English it's it's it's
[09:34] a little bit different and a little bit
[09:36] difficult for me this also when when we
[09:38] spoke in El aler and you were like yeah
[09:40] I'm doing an international podcast and I
[09:42] was like oh that's why I was a little
[09:44] bit hited because my my English is not
[09:46] as good as my Dutch is um but in Dutch
[09:49] it makes sense to explain Bitcoin in and
[09:52] with analogies and I know a lot and can
[09:55] use a lot of analogies that resonate
[09:57] with people so um we started to develop
[10:00] on that idea to describe Concepts that
[10:03] people are familiar with and uh it got
[10:07] traction so back in 2021 after the
[10:10] corona period um we hosted a few lessons
[10:14] for a few universities as well and we
[10:15] did that online um and then we started
[10:18] to see that there was also like a
[10:20] business possibility so right now we're
[10:22] educating uh primary schools we're going
[10:25] to do that next week uh we're educating
[10:28] something that's called
[10:30] MBO but it's kind of similar to high
[10:32] schools and also universities in the
[10:34] Netherlands um and it's growing slowly
[10:38] but gradually um yeah we're really happy
[10:41] with that right now yeah I love that so
[10:43] you're going actually to like public
[10:45] schools and and you educate people
[10:47] people there that that that that's an
[10:49] amazing thing so that that's basically
[10:51] what also El Salvador is is is doing but
[10:54] you're doing an onor uh in in in in
[10:57] Europe that that's I never heard about
[11:00] are do doing that on a regular basis do
[11:03] you have like regular classes there or
[11:06] is it more of like like here there a
[11:08] month uh how how is the the setup there
[11:12] um so with one University we do it on a
[11:14] regular base uh so it's it's called like
[11:17] a um a CO of I think it's a an
[11:22] elective is the English word um and the
[11:25] elective um makes sure that we can
[11:29] uh give guest lectures every quarter I
[11:32] think so quarterly and for uh the high
[11:36] schools it depends on like the weeks
[11:39] that they have because you have similar
[11:41] or different weeks where the the
[11:43] teachers have like a study week or
[11:44] something and then they invite us over
[11:47] and for the primary schools it's the
[11:48] same but everybody is looking into like
[11:51] the development of education right now
[11:53] because the topic is getting more and
[11:55] more I think is gaining more urgency
[11:59] interraction so all the teachers are
[12:02] looking into like is is this the time to
[12:04] develop education for the students or do
[12:07] we still need to wait uh until for
[12:10] example the Minister of Finance will say
[12:12] hey we need to give like a little bit uh
[12:15] a topic about Bitcoin in our financial
[12:17] education um
[12:20] um Financial education offering that
[12:23] we're uh we're handing out right now um
[12:27] yeah so I think if we stay and keep
[12:31] moving the way we're doing right now I
[12:34] think we will be able to develop the
[12:37] first like real education for at least
[12:41] the primary schools and maybe for the
[12:43] high schools but for universities there
[12:45] are already miners being made and um
[12:49] these are quite good and I know a few
[12:50] guys that have developed them as well um
[12:53] but for the other students I think in
[12:56] the lower ages like starting from 10 to
[12:59] maybe 22 and especially then the the um
[13:04] the students that we are focusing on so
[13:05] high schools and primary schools there
[13:08] was no education for them so that's why
[13:10] it's very attractive for us to keep
[13:12] pushing right now and make sure that we
[13:14] can develop it in that range and that
[13:17] target audience as well interesting I
[13:20] love that by the way I just saw i' have
[13:22] the same shirt on as from last time from
[13:26] the photo yeah it's literally the same
[13:28] shirt because only have one from those
[13:31] uh really good and uh by the way your
[13:33] English is really good like um usually
[13:36] the the wrong people say that the
[13:38] English is bad people that that say the
[13:39] English is bad is usually uh the better
[13:42] better English my English is actually
[13:44] not that uh good but people all all
[13:47] obviously understand it um so from what
[13:51] I'm understanding is you are now fully
[13:53] all in in Bitcoin from from the dayto
[13:56] day that you are doing or is there
[13:58] anything uh outside of Bitcoin that that
[14:02] that you're doing I don't know like a
[14:03] fat shop or something like that yeah so
[14:06] uh currently I still have to so I also
[14:09] work at an at a broker um and of course
[14:12] it's a crypto broker um so I've been
[14:16] doing that for over a year right now uh
[14:18] which is a lot of fun because it also
[14:20] teaches you like the institutional side
[14:22] and more the business side of the the
[14:25] yeah let's call it the crypto
[14:27] industry um and also the Need For
[14:30] Education like it it it makes the the
[14:36] um like the the concept that we have of
[14:39] the industry it it broadens it and
[14:41] that's something something I will repeat
[14:44] and I'm repeating it quite often it's
[14:46] like people need to get the world better
[14:51] and if they get the world better then
[14:53] will they will get Bitcoin better and
[14:55] especially like we were talking about
[14:57] Game Theory and systems and incen
[14:59] incentives and why things are the way
[15:01] they are and I also had that for example
[15:04] with the meme coin hype or with
[15:06] exchanges and their responsibility their
[15:09] societal responsibility that they have
[15:11] like if you uh if you're getting new
[15:14] customers how are you making sure as an
[15:16] exchange that you're not only seeing
[15:18] them as for example exit liquidity or
[15:21] just liquidity but are you also
[15:24] providing them something because the the
[15:27] reason why um exchanges are getting
[15:30] clients I hope is also because they want
[15:32] to make sure that these clients will uh
[15:34] provide themselves with a better future
[15:36] and the exchange is also a tool to help
[15:38] them with providing that better future
[15:41] um like Bitcoin is also a tool that
[15:43] helps people to well I think to get a
[15:46] better future um so the responsibility
[15:50] that exchanges and Brokers
[15:52] have yeah it it became a lot more
[15:55] visible for me uh being internal in such
[15:58] an organization
[15:59] and it's helping a lot so yeah that's
[16:02] really cool also the the time frame is
[16:04] interesting I think you said five years
[16:07] ago you you started with with educating
[16:09] people uh when I remember correctly five
[16:12] years is a long freaking time in in
[16:16] Bitcoin there's a lot of things uh H
[16:18] happening and I remember even when I
[16:22] came into the space uh 2020 which is
[16:25] like four and a half years ago now so
[16:27] like almost the same time
[16:29] um the educational space was already
[16:33] quite good but not nearly as good as now
[16:38] going back to like 2019 18 17 there was
[16:41] all the the educational side and the the
[16:44] Bitcoin uh side was just not as
[16:47] developed as it is now now we have so
[16:49] many even Bitcoin only podcasts we have
[16:52] educational uh offerings we have so many
[16:55] great speakers we have so many books
[16:57] like it's f
[16:59] how many books they are in Bitcoin once
[17:01] you get to really dive deeper like like
[17:03] I cannot even read all of the books
[17:05] because there are so many of them um so
[17:08] I I think we the educational side really
[17:10] developed good uh and uh now it's just
[17:14] like
[17:15] making uh packages for specific niches
[17:19] for example I recently had the former
[17:21] Red Bull CEO of North America on and he
[17:25] talked about how uh SE level Executives
[17:28] don't have time to watch like 20 hours
[17:30] of podcast they need like very short uh
[17:34] and comprehens information uh that makes
[17:37] sense makes them interested and makes
[17:39] them curious to learn more uh and to
[17:43] really look deeper because their time is
[17:45] so so busy and valuable that they don't
[17:47] want to do it and they also live in a
[17:49] world
[17:50] where they they don't have the problems
[17:53] that other people have like the the sea
[17:54] levels they are compensated nicely uh so
[17:57] they don't experience inflation as bad
[18:00] as as someone else because they don't
[18:02] have to struggle for their life uh they
[18:04] have other problems that they have to
[18:06] solve they have problems with the
[18:07] company uh and problems with the balance
[18:09] sheet and stuff like that and that's why
[18:11] they have to adopt Bitcoin for another
[18:13] reason um but just condensing the
[18:15] information now educational wise to
[18:18] different cohorts of people to on board
[18:21] now like the masses I think that's more
[18:23] of the uh more of the the mission and I
[18:27] love that you're going uh to the
[18:29] university and going to to the to the
[18:32] public places that are needing those uh
[18:35] because you can directly suit the the
[18:39] bit Bitcoin education for the audience
[18:41] there and really make it a nice package
[18:44] and I think we need uh this Grassroots
[18:46] movements so that just wanted to say
[18:49] thank you for the the work that you're
[18:50] doing because that's really really
[18:52] important uh to to have in Bitcoin I I
[18:55] love that yeah yeah thanks and but it's
[18:59] like you're doing the same thing right
[19:01] so you're not only serving uh the people
[19:04] that are um longer in this industry like
[19:07] for example when I started back in
[19:10] 2016 um what you explained is like you
[19:12] didn't have like someone close to your
[19:15] in your environment that could like give
[19:17] you a hand and show you everything
[19:18] around and um the thing was I did and
[19:22] that wasn't something that I already
[19:23] knew because I went to an event
[19:27] and on that event I I see like an old
[19:30] classmate of mine and I was like what
[19:31] the hell are you doing here and he's
[19:33] like bro what the hell are you doing
[19:35] here weren't you playing football
[19:37] because I used to play uh professional
[19:39] football in the Netherlands and then I
[19:41] was like yes but now I I dove into
[19:43] Bitcoin and it's like amazing he's like
[19:45] bro I've been working in this industry
[19:47] since
[19:48] 2013 and you need to do this this this
[19:50] and this so I just checked all the uh
[19:54] the things that were on the list like
[19:55] for example watch all the videos from
[19:57] Andreas anop buy his books read all his
[20:00] books um then after that I
[20:04] started creating content because he also
[20:06] told me like just start writing because
[20:08] if you start writing then you see like
[20:10] how how good you get the picture um and
[20:13] after that I was like okay but now I'm
[20:15] writing and I'm getting industry better
[20:18] I need to work in this industry so then
[20:19] I started to work at a blockchain
[20:21] company um it was a blockchain
[20:23] implementation partner and and we
[20:25] developed all type of solutions uh
[20:28] blockchain based Solutions so then I got
[20:31] a grasp of how the technology works and
[20:34] what businesses could or could not use
[20:36] and especially the importance of Bitcoin
[20:40] um which still a lot of people do not
[20:43] get yet um so um I think it's necessary
[20:48] that we can do that in all
[20:50] different um in all different Target
[20:53] audiences and that's why I like to work
[20:55] and um see how all different niches in
[20:59] the industry are working together um so
[21:03] there's only one thing that I still
[21:05] wanted to do that was on my list I was
[21:07] like okay I need to I need to be a
[21:10] writer uh I needed to be something um
[21:13] like in a technical function so for
[21:15] example like a blockchain architect so
[21:17] kind of did that was more a bit of
[21:19] Business Development but also did a l of
[21:21] blockchain architecture um and the last
[21:24] thing was um or one of the things that I
[21:26] also wanted to do was working in
[21:28] exchange or a broker just to see how
[21:30] that works and one of the last things
[21:32] that is on my list is like be like a
[21:33] product manager or something to really
[21:36] understand how does like a tech product
[21:39] work um I don't think I'm going to
[21:42] finish that one um because it's way like
[21:46] Bitcoin is so much um but maybe I'm
[21:50] still going to do it but if we can do
[21:52] that and you see all like the different
[21:54] worlds then it becomes way easier to
[21:56] explain to everybody whether you're a
[21:58] kid or a CEO in a company because you
[22:01] can better understand the problems that
[22:03] they have um yeah really cool you were
[22:08] professional football player in in in
[22:09] the Netherlands you you still playing or
[22:12] well yeah like it was semi no yeah it
[22:15] was full Pro but it wasn't the first
[22:17] League um I yeah I played first League
[22:20] one year but I I wasn't like the the
[22:24] best guy I think that's that's the
[22:25] reason why I jumped over to the crypto
[22:27] space because I sometimes you just feel
[22:29] that you're not in place um so mostly
[22:34] when we had conversations and there're
[22:36] still one guy because back in 2016 when
[22:39] we first got into and I'm saying we
[22:42] because it was like a group um when we
[22:45] got into uh Bitcoin it was at like The
[22:48] Breakfast Table where we were sitting
[22:50] and having breakfast with the the
[22:52] teammates because we were always in
[22:54] search for new opportunities and then we
[22:56] were like hey let's have a look at
[22:57] Bitcoin and and we waited and we waited
[23:00] and then at the end of
[23:02] 2016 the price got up again and then it
[23:04] dipped and then in 2017 in the beginning
[23:07] we were like bro why didn't we why
[23:09] didn't we bought like a little piece um
[23:12] so that's how how I got into into
[23:15] Bitcoin like yeah so it's than to
[23:19] football so so that's uh that that's
[23:22] your profile right there oh yeah
[23:29] so so you're almost worth a full Bitcoin
[23:31] then almost
[23:35] almost I used to be like um yeah I think
[23:38] what is it s it's saying here Center
[23:40] back yeah I used to be like a defensive
[23:42] midfielder um that's why I played most
[23:45] of my professional games but yeah and oh
[23:48] you are Surinam oh we I think we talked
[23:50] about it right that you are Netherlands
[23:51] and Surin that's super interesting did
[23:54] you hear about Maya bab the that the
[23:57] police showed up at her door up oh no I
[23:59] didn't okay uh I I I only read the Tweet
[24:03] like like literally like 10 seconds I
[24:05] think but she wrote about that the
[24:07] police showed up in her doorsteps uh and
[24:10] and and what happened there I will have
[24:13] a podcast actually next week with her
[24:16] and Rahim I'm really looking forward to
[24:18] to the story and and how the election is
[24:20] going because I think the election is
[24:22] quite soon I think it's like uh first
[24:26] quarter this year or second quarter this
[24:28] year somewhere along those lines so I'm
[24:30] really looking forward to to seeing that
[24:33] by the way that uh that side has as much
[24:36] advertisement as as you can have oh yeah
[24:40] yeah I'm seeing the Tweet I'm reading
[24:41] the Tweet right now yeah this morning
[24:43] two police officers arrived at my home
[24:44] summoning me for questioning
[24:47] okay well yeah that that that was uh
[24:50] interesting of like okay H they they
[24:54] they they seem to be fearful of her uh
[24:57] otherwise would not do it right the they
[25:00] they I mean I don't know the full uh
[25:02] full story and I I I want to talk with
[25:05] with her next week to get the full story
[25:07] of like okay what was happening what did
[25:09] they say they wanted and and why did
[25:12] this happen uh H because the first part
[25:15] that we did with her was already with
[25:17] like uh she told what they already do
[25:23] and then we kind of got to the point of
[25:25] uh what is she fearful that they might
[25:27] do her uh and then the internet
[25:30] connection actually broke
[25:31] down which was super fun uh because uh
[25:36] we like oh like they they they they are
[25:38] watching what you're saying on podcast
[25:40] and they they turn off internet
[25:41] connection I me I don't think that had
[25:43] happened but it was really like at the
[25:47] at the right moment all of a sudden
[25:49] internet broke down and then we was like
[25:51] okay let's uh let's do the second part
[25:53] let's just keep that as an end because
[25:55] it was already like one hour long let's
[25:57] do the second part
[25:58] uh in in like half a year or something
[26:00] like that um that's super interesting so
[26:04] uh you apart from suam did you grow up
[26:06] in Surinam or did you had a father or a
[26:08] mother from there or no so both my
[26:11] parents are from Surinam uh I grew up in
[26:13] the Netherlands actually but when I was
[26:15] a little kid we moved to kurasa um which
[26:19] is uh like a one of the small islands of
[26:22] the ABC Island um so yeah and then I
[26:26] think when I was six we moved back to
[26:28] the Netherlands and then I grew up here
[26:30] so uh full cames but didn't grew up in
[26:33]  I partnered up with coin vigilante
[26:37] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[26:40] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[26:43] look at that beauty I love it so much
[26:45] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[26:49] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[26:51] way to go out there and show that you
[26:54] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[26:57] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[27:00] dropped a completely new and amazing
[27:03] Genesis edition of their watch
[27:06] collections you have the date of the
[27:08] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[27:11] and of course also the block height and
[27:14] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[27:17] the level of detail they put in in this
[27:20] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[27:22] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[27:26] down in the descriptions I love those
[27:28] watches so so much if you watch or
[27:31] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[27:34] I'll guess you already bought some
[27:36] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[27:38] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[27:42] in a hardware wallet my personal
[27:44] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[27:46] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[27:48] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[27:50] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[27:53] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[27:57] with the code at the checkout visit
[28:00] bitbox do Swiss robobin to get your
[28:04] bitbox and the next step is to really
[28:06] level up your sovereignty as an
[28:08] individual you have to have the most
[28:10] secure self- custody setup you have to
[28:13] secure your own devices you have to
[28:16] protect your privacy you have to set up
[28:19] an inheritance plan and depending on
[28:21] where you live you even want to have a
[28:23] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[28:26] in case something goes real really
[28:28] really wrong and through all those steps
[28:30] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[28:32] step by step and if you visit the
[28:35] Bitcoin way.com
[28:37] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[28:40] minute free call to find out how you can
[28:43] level up your sovereignty what do you
[28:46] make of of Surinam do you think she has
[28:48] a chance to to win the election and uh
[28:50] give something great to the country no
[28:53] this is the discussion that I had and
[28:55] I'm still having with a lot of camese
[28:57] people as still have family living there
[28:59] and my my aunt is also there my nephews
[29:02] still live there like the corruption
[29:05] there I I think it's I'm not going to
[29:07] say that it's part of the culture um but
[29:09] it's wi widely accepted
[29:12] so um and that's yeah I think it's it's
[29:16] very weird because if you talk about
[29:18] Solutions then people will most likely
[29:22] say oh yeah well that's a great solution
[29:25] but it will probably it will probably
[29:27] not work
[29:29] so that means that like it's it's so
[29:31] embedded into the society that people
[29:34] are are like
[29:36] already I think like they gave up um so
[29:40] there needs to be like I think a new
[29:42] generation that is like okay we're going
[29:44] to develop a plan and we're not going to
[29:47] do it the way politics normally do it
[29:49] because how it works in politics is
[29:51] somebody has a plan and that plan that
[29:53] works for three years and then it's not
[29:55] working U and then somebody else is yeah
[29:57] but we're going to do it completely
[29:58] different and well okay maybe we should
[30:01] have long-term vision for like 25 or 50
[30:04] years and make sure that we stick to the
[30:06] plan and develop something that can work
[30:09] if we actually stick to it um but I
[30:13] don't think that right now there
[30:15] are people that are willing to have that
[30:18] long-term of a vision which is also
[30:21] logic because who the hell wants to live
[30:23] a shitty life for long-term
[30:26] Vision um so it it becomes a really in
[30:30] my opinion it becomes a hard question
[30:32] because everybody wants to have a good
[30:33] life for their kids but also everybody
[30:36] wants to have a good life for themselves
[30:37] right now um and that's what most people
[30:40] are doing right now I think in serum if
[30:42] they have the opportunity they're like
[30:44] okay I want a good life for my kids but
[30:46] I also want to have a good life now so
[30:49] if I could make sure that I can have a
[30:51] good life now and provide for my kids
[30:54] then I rather choose that solution than
[30:56] give a good life to everybody else's
[30:58] kids and have a life right now um
[31:01] so what most people do is they move they
[31:04] move to a country where uh the the Fiat
[31:07] system or the system is a bit better um
[31:11] where they get a better pay and that's
[31:13] what I think most enemies people do is
[31:16] they move to the Netherlands because
[31:17] they speak the same language uh and the
[31:20] education in the Netherlands is just
[31:21] good so yeah why wouldn't you but then
[31:25] all the
[31:26] knowledge stays or leaves the country um
[31:30] and it it's and then for example if you
[31:33] go back to serum it's I think it's
[31:35] really hard because you don't understand
[31:37] the culture you don't understand the
[31:38] problems that they have it's it's not
[31:40] like embedded into you so the solutions
[31:44] that you come up with it kind of feels
[31:46] like um you're the guy that knows it
[31:49] better um or the girl that knows it
[31:51] better while you don't um so it's it's
[31:55] in my opinion it's a bit hard to get
[31:58] back to suram as diaspora and to come
[32:00] with Solutions because we don't
[32:01] experience these
[32:03] problems yeah it's uh I I think that's
[32:07] that's a problem a lot of countries have
[32:09] where the the the great talent uh if
[32:13] there's if if there's a great talent and
[32:16] and motivated people H they have
[32:19] basically two choices of like do I fight
[32:21] for my own country and spend my life
[32:24] energy on improving that country or do I
[32:28] just move to another country and have a
[32:30] way Easy Life probably quicker more
[32:33] success and uh can foster the better
[32:39] opportunities around me in the new
[32:41] country especially if there's a a
[32:44] country that is uh has the same language
[32:47] which is an A major advantage because
[32:48] you want to be able to speak the native
[32:50] language
[32:52] um that that is a a hard problem to have
[32:57] because these choices are only made if
[33:00] people have the opportunity to make such
[33:03] a choice like if the system is set up in
[33:06] a way that you can have a comfortable
[33:08] life in the country where you're from
[33:11] then they will probably not make that
[33:12] solution or think of a solution in in
[33:16] that category or that type of category
[33:18] but category uh but right now they do so
[33:22] then it becomes really hard to solve you
[33:24] know that's true I I never thought about
[33:28] moving before I got the income outside
[33:33] of Austria like right now I don't have
[33:35] any income out of Austria like almost no
[33:38] income out of Austria uh so I can move
[33:42] whereever I want to move like I I I
[33:45] don't have to be here um which is like
[33:48] the first time ever last year where I
[33:51] questions of like is Austria a good
[33:53] place to live like is there other places
[33:55] that are better and the more I travel
[33:58] the more I come to the conclusion like
[33:59] Austria is actually a quite nice country
[34:02] and probably one of the best countries
[34:03] to live in if you don't see the EU if
[34:07] you don't see the tax
[34:09] system like outside of that which there
[34:12] are some uh weird things happening uh
[34:15] it's a really good country like the the
[34:17] water is clean the food is really good
[34:20] uh the there's a rich culture here uh
[34:23] it's it's not dangerous like it's it's a
[34:25] quite safe City uh there's not lot
[34:27] happen opening um you have access to
[34:30] everything that you need the public
[34:31] transport is good uh you can have a car
[34:34] you can drive around with it really good
[34:35] so like there's all all the things that
[34:37] you basically need and it's it's really
[34:39] nice um but there are some frustrating
[34:42] things on the legal side which I'm
[34:44] hopeful that it changes but maybe I'm
[34:46] naive and young for believing that um
[34:50] but I I came to the conclusion that I
[34:52] want to stay Austria uh and want to try
[34:55] to fix it a little bit and try to
[34:56] influence it a little bit but if the
[34:59] point comes of like oh like I cannot do
[35:01] anything here H and it's way better in
[35:05] whatever country I will move there
[35:07] because I'm not depending on Austria at
[35:11] all but you're right most don't even
[35:14] have that choice like most don't even
[35:16] have the choice of like oh like I can
[35:18] move somewhere else or some some don't
[35:21] even want that so uh that that's a it's
[35:25] a hard place to to be if you're in a
[35:27] country that you don't
[35:29] know you want to improve but you're not
[35:32] sure like how how you can even begin to
[35:34] to do that that's it it really be really
[35:38] I'm really looking forward to the
[35:39] interview with with um um with May next
[35:44] week it will be fun to to talk about the
[35:47] the future potential of of Surinam what
[35:49] are uh the country is really small like
[35:52] right that's like 600,000 people or
[35:54] something like that it's like half of
[35:55] Vienna that's uh it's it's it's not a
[35:58] lot of people I
[35:59] guess yeah such a such a small country
[36:03] and a lot of people that are actually
[36:06] camese or living abroad
[36:08] so
[36:10] um yeah I'm I'm I'm just really hoping
[36:12] that things he had better because uh
[36:15] yeah from what I'm hearing from my
[36:17] family it's it's getting really hard for
[36:19] people to to to to make a living and to
[36:23] have like everybody wants to have a
[36:25] that's the the whole thing everybody
[36:27] want to have like an easy life the soft
[36:30] life with as little stress as possible
[36:35] just being able to to pay your bills if
[36:38] you have bills to do
[36:39] groceries um and
[36:42] then if you think of how this all is
[36:45] happening because it's still happening
[36:47] it didn't happen it's still happening
[36:50] then we need to think of okay all the
[36:51] agreements that are made in the money
[36:54] system and the the the political system
[36:57] that is set up
[36:59] and that's when it gets so complicated
[37:02] to think of the right Solutions and
[37:04] that's where I see the responsibility
[37:06] like
[37:07] in like a small part of the solution is
[37:11] like getting a better idea of how the
[37:15] world works and one of these Concepts in
[37:17] the world that plays a huge part in my
[37:19] opinion is the concept of money and how
[37:22] money Works um and especially how it
[37:25] influ influences your life and right now
[37:27] we're focusing on
[37:29] technology below the money and how that
[37:32] works um because I think in 10 to 15
[37:36] years maybe people will no longer speak
[37:39] about how Bitcoin as a network is
[37:42] functioning I think that everybody will
[37:44] be like yeah it's just functioning but
[37:47] right now I think it's it's so exciting
[37:49] to to see how everything works
[37:51] especially how it influences people and
[37:54] um to see if Cycles in the future will
[37:57] be the same why Cycles are are the way
[37:59] they are um and if we get that now and
[38:02] we can explain that to the youth or to
[38:04] the students then they can think of I
[38:07] think better Solutions because also
[38:09] Bitcoin will probably not be the thing
[38:11] that will be here in like 80 or maybe
[38:14] 100 years there will probably be
[38:16] something different um but for now I
[38:19] think it's very important that we
[38:21] explain it to the youth and uh make sure
[38:23] that they can yeah just see it as like a
[38:27] a temporary solution because nothing
[38:30] lasts
[38:32] forever I I might disagree with that I
[38:34] think uh Bitcoin has the chance of being
[38:37] the the end all be all money because
[38:40] it's the first one that's moldable like
[38:43] it's the first one that that you can
[38:45] change around and it could make the uh
[38:48] the network effect I don't know like how
[38:51] like unless there is something major
[38:54] happening like an alien species coming
[38:57] and wanting and they're forcing their
[38:59] currency because they are superior in in
[39:02] in as a species and forcing their
[39:04] currency on us um with the current
[39:08] technology stack with the current Earth
[39:10] that we have I don't see anything but
[39:14] it's very well possible that we don't
[39:16] see what what we cannot see so I'm I'm
[39:20] aware that there's always a Black Swan
[39:24] uh it's like there there's always
[39:25] something that you don't see
[39:27] that that is coming if you just think
[39:30] back like 300
[39:32] years the things that we are doing now
[39:35] is completely crazy for a person 300
[39:39] years ago um but at the same time there
[39:44] are people on Earth today that live like
[39:46] people from 300 years ago uh they're
[39:49] like completely outside of everything
[39:51] there's like small tribes of of people
[39:54] uh that are
[39:55] completely un attached and detached from
[39:58] society which is super fun that we live
[40:01] in that on the same planet um but I do
[40:05] see the possibility that if Bitcoin gets
[40:10] to be a major store of value in the
[40:13] world that we can mold it do whatever we
[40:16] need to mold it towards uh like Bitcoin
[40:20] then the question is is that still
[40:21] Bitcoin yeah that that's a fair question
[40:23] uh like we we it's it's probably we we
[40:26] probably keep the name but it's
[40:28] definitely changing uh so that that's an
[40:31] interesting question of like if if if
[40:34] you compare the first iPhone to the last
[40:36] iPhone there's a lot happening but no no
[40:39] there's actually not that much happening
[40:41] but uh iPhone is not that but um no but
[40:46] if you can say the first smartphone to
[40:47] the last smartphone like the and that's
[40:49] the thing everything gets will get
[40:51] better in time and we've seen like the
[40:54] uh the research where they were using
[40:56] like an AI and hologram and stuff you
[40:58] know when we were little kids we were
[41:00] thinking about how we used to or how we
[41:02] would travel the world in the future
[41:04] with like uh hover cars or something you
[41:08] know that you can fly in the air but it
[41:10] it totally doesn't make sense because
[41:11] the infrastructure then gets
[41:13] because why would you have roads so it's
[41:15] way smarter to do it like below the city
[41:18] instead of above um so all these ideas
[41:21] are like I think they will change in the
[41:23] future because for one we all the people
[41:27] have like well not all the people um
[41:31] people that are trying to develop the
[41:32] world already have a view of well where
[41:34] the world needs to go um but we also
[41:38] need to take into account that we have a
[41:39] world right now so um like for example I
[41:44] think the best example is like AI um AI
[41:49] like they can do a lot of with AI
[41:52] right now they could but they also know
[41:54] that if they would do it right now that
[41:56] it would have so much um uh the effect
[42:00] would be so big I think it's like um the
[42:03] implications and in the Netherlands we
[42:05] say Nava effect so the implications of
[42:07] the implications of the
[42:09] implications um and then it becomes very
[42:11] hard to to see where stuff will go so
[42:14] then it's maybe better to
[42:17] slowly put something into the Earth and
[42:20] see how everything is reacting and then
[42:22] make sure that you have the right
[42:24] research team that can find out okay
[42:26] let's make some models and the
[42:28] projections and then again do it slowly
[42:30] again and I think that's also what will
[42:32] happen to like Bitcoin and is happening
[42:34] right now to bitcoin and then eventually
[42:37] U there will be
[42:38] something that's kind of
[42:40] similar but it will also be very
[42:43] different because Fiat digital Fiat um
[42:48] M2 as we call it it's digital money but
[42:52] it's not digitally
[42:54] born um I I because it's like the the
[42:59] Bitcoin today is already quite different
[43:01] to the Bitcoin uh 2010 it's it's already
[43:05] just 15 years and it developed there are
[43:08] some things like time locks and multi
[43:11] and the seed phrases I think those are
[43:13] all things that uh I'm not sure about
[43:16] mulc but uh seed phrases definitely and
[43:20] time locks and and a bunch of other
[43:22] things that you can now do on on the
[43:23] main layer of Bitcoin uh that uh are
[43:27] were not possible in
[43:30] 2010 uh and were not necessary in 2010
[43:33] also uh so uh in if if we already see in
[43:37] 15 years a lot of changes to bitcoin or
[43:39] like improvements what happens in 50 to
[43:42] 100 years towards Bitcoin um will will
[43:46] be might be a completely different
[43:49] Bitcoin but still maybe we call it
[43:51] Bitcoin so so that that's a good
[43:53] argument of like is it still Bitcoin uh
[43:56] if if it's uh something completely
[43:58] different or like something that is very
[44:00] molded at that time but that's kind of
[44:02] the argument of like that's why DCP is
[44:05] still around right it's uh we could do
[44:07] something different but it's still the
[44:09] base layer like Facebook and all of all
[44:11] of the apps uh and that's kind of my
[44:13] thesis of like Bitcoin is the new base
[44:16] layer of financial systems and we just
[44:19] build everything on top of it and um the
[44:23] thing is once you get that Bas layer
[44:25] once you get that protocol
[44:27] and you're building everything on top of
[44:29] it in 50 years it becomes really really
[44:33] really of a high cost for society to
[44:36] change that around in a major way so uh
[44:40] we will always mold it and I I think if
[44:44] we stop developing Bitcoin today it will
[44:46] die out in 10 15 years like maximum like
[44:49] probably sooner than that like we have
[44:51] to fix bux we have to upgrade it we have
[44:53] to do things to the main layer but we
[44:56] should not do too much to it um but I do
[44:59] think it has the potential to live a
[45:02] very long life because we can mold it
[45:05] because it is something we can change
[45:08] around think about how long gold was
[45:11] money uh and how bad gold is actually
[45:15] able to be money because like you cannot
[45:18] send it around and then then we once
[45:21] gold was not money anymore because we
[45:22] had the issuance of field
[45:25] currencies the the advantages of of the
[45:28] Fiat currencies are now in
[45:31] Bitcoin plus we have the advantages of
[45:33] gold it's kind of the the marriage
[45:35] between Fiat and gold is now Bitcoin and
[45:39] the individual uh advantages of Fiat and
[45:42] gold are even improved on bitcoin so
[45:45] it's already like a such a way better
[45:48] technology than anything else that we
[45:50] currently have but you're right there
[45:53] might come something way way better I
[45:56] don't see that happening in my lifetime
[45:58] I don't see that happening anytime soon
[46:01] and maybe the the next better Bitcoin is
[46:04] just uh a molded or a slightly
[46:07] manipulated Bitcoin version uh where we
[46:10] can uh work on the ecosystem a little
[46:14] bit on the
[46:15] protol and on applications and banking
[46:18] systems because I do think we will have
[46:21] them in the future also like banking
[46:23] systems and and and uh applications that
[46:26] are convenient but yeah
[46:28] like that that's an interesting
[46:30] discussion how do you see that yeah to
[46:34] me it's like it's inevitable that
[46:36] eventually there will be something
[46:38] that's better like what you were
[46:40] discussing before like they
[46:44] um you cannot see what you cannot see
[46:47] like the unknown unknowns um and they
[46:49] will probably be there because if I look
[46:52] at everything that Bitcoin is doing
[46:53] right now then I'm like okay I've read
[46:55] tons of books
[46:57] and I'm highly convinced that there
[47:00] isn't something that is better than
[47:01] Bitcoin at this moment um but I wasn't
[47:05] that highly convinced 20 years ago or 15
[47:08] years ago um as a matter of fact 15
[47:12] years ago I didn't even hear about
[47:13] Bitcoin but it was there um so I think
[47:17] in 80 years and when we'll see like in
[47:20] when is it to
[47:22] 240 um when the last Bitcoin will be M
[47:25] then
[47:27] yeah then there will be people that
[47:30] are um and have experience like
[47:33] everything that Bitcoin is doing they
[47:36] have experienced like all the problems
[47:38] that Bitcoin will bring us as well
[47:40] because right now we're
[47:42] experiencing the problems only in on the
[47:45] financial side um but I think it's too
[47:49] little time to to talk about all the
[47:52] problems and the effects that it will
[47:53] have on the world so that's why I'm
[47:55] thinking like okay there will will
[47:57] probably something be um that we will
[48:01] not see and that will be a big problem
[48:03] like for example the Privacy thing is
[48:05] something that we're talking about a lot
[48:07] um the the the minus distribution like
[48:11] for example we've seen that that there
[48:13] were I think
[48:15] 15 uh what was it ofac uh sanctions or
[48:19] something um where transactions were
[48:22] flagged and what if different pools will
[48:24] not take on blocks that have transaction
[48:27] that need to be approved and then they
[48:29] will move on to another chain like that
[48:30] could be a real big problem um and
[48:33] that's something that we're talking
[48:34] about right now so imagine in 20 50 or
[48:39] 60 years um how much problems will will
[48:43] occur then um but still today if I'm
[48:46] looking at today at Bitcoin I don't
[48:47] think there's anything better right now
[48:51] um but yeah the question you have is how
[48:53] was I looking at the
[48:55] development uh um I think there will be
[48:58] like a lot yeah a lot of different
[49:01] products built on top of or built with
[49:04] Bitcoin like it's no coincidence that
[49:08] Michael sailor with his micro strategy
[49:10] change their name to strategy which is
[49:13] quite funny
[49:15] um but there are a lot of people
[49:18] especially in the tech space that are
[49:19] seeing it also right now and um at one
[49:23] point everybody had that aha moment you
[49:25] know and if you have that aha moment
[49:28] then the mind it becomes like a it's
[49:31] it's like a a blank canvas where you can
[49:34] you can see Bitcoin in everything um but
[49:37] the thing that we discuss is like do you
[49:39] see Bitcoin then as a tool um and solely
[49:43] as a tool and where can you find
[49:45] Solutions or where can you find problems
[49:47] that that you could use that tool um
[49:49] instead of the other way around because
[49:51] that's also thing I I hate the the quote
[49:54] like Bitcoin sols it I hate I really
[49:56] hate
[49:57] it I'm like okay let's let's just focus
[50:00] on bitcoin and not like oh yeah Bitcoin
[50:02] sols it no well it doesn't um it sols it
[50:07] temporarily but if if something is
[50:08] solved temporarily does it mean that
[50:10] it's solved or is it just kicking the
[50:11] can forward and when I die somebody else
[50:14] will need to kick the can forward as
[50:15] well and um I think that we use I think
[50:19] we need to use need to look at real
[50:22] solutions um that Bitcoin is delivering
[50:25] to us and also present them then as real
[50:28] solutions but present the problems as
[50:30] problems um and it's also possible that
[50:33] some problems cannot be solved U because
[50:36] there was one great book I think what's
[50:38] his his name um the book is about Game
[50:42] Theory and I think it's
[50:45] called
[50:47] um finite and
[50:52] infinity finite and infinite games
[50:54] that's the name finite and infinite
[50:56] games
[50:57] um but then it becomes like a game where
[50:59] we need to make sure that we can keep
[51:02] playing the game of moving the problems
[51:05] forward but that's also what we're doing
[51:07] right now with the depth system um so
[51:10] then you can ask yourself like is is is
[51:13] that part of life that we need to have
[51:16] problems that we will need to push
[51:17] forward and somebody else will need to
[51:19] kick that can or can we actually solve
[51:21] them and um that's what I think that we
[51:25] are trying to do with Bitcoin or I hope
[51:27] what we're trying to do really long on
[51:30] talk yeah yeah it's a super interesting
[51:33] topic for me because um people ask me
[51:36] okay like you're such a hyperb on
[51:39] bitcoin like how how do you think it can
[51:41] fail and I usually bring up one thing
[51:44] that's the only thing that I think where
[51:46] Bitcoin might fail is if we have more
[51:50] than three planets that have different
[51:53] currencies and we need a currency
[51:56] between the planets so we are we are as
[51:58] human beings an
[52:00] interplanetary uh
[52:01] species I think Bitcoin will be the sole
[52:06] money of Earth as long as it's just
[52:11] Earth it's a weird saying but um because
[52:16] the the problems that you say like
[52:17] they're super valid with the the mining
[52:19] pools and the templates that they can
[52:20] put in there and uh there are basically
[52:23] just five pools and those five pools
[52:25] actually not five pools they are more
[52:26] like two pools uh because they kind of
[52:28] work together uh but we work on on uh
[52:32] Solutions like with ocean and and with
[52:35] with solo miners so like that I think
[52:37] those are things that help prevent the
[52:40] worst case situations and the incentive
[52:44] of earning money for miners is greater
[52:47] than um complying longterm with any
[52:50] government uh list so I I I do think
[52:53] that's a problem that we will actually
[52:55] solve long term but you right currently
[52:58] it is um mediocre kind of a problem uh
[53:02] we for example had once the problem of
[53:05] losing a lot of keys uh um and losing a
[53:08] lot of Bitcoin with that we uh did a pip
[53:12] uh bip 39 list I think it was with the
[53:14] seed phrases um so we already
[53:18] encountered a lot of problems uh in
[53:20] Bitcoin and
[53:22] already uh worked in Solutions so that's
[53:25] was was my is my whole theory of like we
[53:28] have a protocol that is moldable that is
[53:32] uh changeable uh and if something exit
[53:36] existential happens to bitcoin the
[53:39] incentive of the whole network is to fix
[53:41] that thing with so much money in there
[53:43] and with so much brain power in there
[53:47] I'm very certain that we can fix it and
[53:51] mold it in a in a in a better way uh
[53:54] it's it's the same thing of like when
[53:56] when there's something interesting in
[53:57] altcoins that is happening like smart
[54:00] contracts Bitcoin is just adopting that
[54:03] technology uh I I kind of see altcoins
[54:05] actually as the perfect test Network for
[54:08] Bitcoin i i before started the podcast I
[54:10] hated altcoins now I kind of like
[54:12] altcoins I don't have have them I don't
[54:15] use them but I see them as a great uh
[54:18] experime experimental place for what we
[54:22] can do on blockchain technology and if
[54:24] something really makes sense we can
[54:25] adopt it for Bitcoin
[54:26] uh it's it's the perfect test Network
[54:29] for uh for Bitcoin in the future uh so I
[54:33] obviously don't know if I'm right long
[54:35] term if uh if Bitcoin at some point is
[54:39] getting is is getting replaced with
[54:42] something better in in that one thing
[54:46] that I want to raise here is also
[54:48] Network effects are so huge with social
[54:52] media apps we have Facebook and Facebook
[54:54] is still the largest play in in social
[54:57] media even though it seems like nobody
[54:59] is using it but it's still the largest
[55:02] player and there are so many big
[55:04] competitors and social media apps are so
[55:07] easy to switch like you can easily
[55:09] switch from like Facebook to uh uh like
[55:13] let's say Instagram or from Facebook to
[55:15] let's say Tik Tok or Twitter or
[55:17] something else and still those social
[55:19] media platforms have such a huge uh
[55:23] tremendous Network effect think about
[55:25] YouTube there's not there's not even a
[55:28] second best video platform out there
[55:30] like there's short from video platforms
[55:33] out there with like Tik Tok but there's
[55:36] nothing that even comes close to the
[55:38] power the data set that has that is
[55:43] YouTube there's Rumble I know there's
[55:45] nost there's other there's Twitter but
[55:47] they are they are tiny teeny tiny
[55:50] against YouTube and then uh when when we
[55:53] see those Network effects and those
[55:55] those things of social media apps think
[55:58] about how hard it is to change money
[56:01] because all of the sudden there's is an
[56:03] opportunity cost if you change your
[56:05] money system from like Bitcoin to like
[56:08] uh whatever comes uh is the competitor
[56:11] of that you have the potential of losing
[56:14] everything the the whole your whole
[56:16] financial energy if you switch social
[56:19] media app like there's no cost to that
[56:22] like you can literally have 50,000
[56:25] social media apps on your phone if you
[56:27] have the storage capacity for that so um
[56:31] uh that that's kind of my point the the
[56:33] incentive once we adopt Bitcoin to a
[56:36] certain extent and I think we're not
[56:37] there yet uh once we hit that certain
[56:40] extent the incentive to fix Bitcoin uh
[56:44] is greater than to replace Bitcoin
[56:48] unless we have a a hard limit with
[56:54] interplanetary currencies where we have
[56:56] multiple planets and we have to have
[56:59] something that works together
[57:03] uh with different planets it's kind of
[57:06] the problem that gold ran into because
[57:09] all of the sudden we have a globalized
[57:10] world and uh you cannot send the gold
[57:13] bar from Austria to Netherlands easily
[57:16] or from from from Netherlands to Surinam
[57:19] it's it's really hard to send that it's
[57:21] really costly also to send that that's
[57:23] why we have Bitcoin for that that's why
[57:25] we had feat but Fe had a
[57:27] decentralization problem now we have
[57:28] Bitcoin to fix both of them uh if if if
[57:32] that theory makes sense I just wanted to
[57:35] uh give GI out there yeah of course um
[57:39] and U well as you know
[57:41] because um you know that I'm a huge fan
[57:45] of Bitcoin but I'm also looking at like
[57:47] maybe the problems and especially from
[57:49] like the ether's perspective like
[57:51] Bitcoin is was and I think it needs to
[57:55] be like
[57:56] um and give people a choice so with
[57:59] Bitcoin you have a choice and you can
[58:01] make sure sure that you can
[58:04] um uh can can how do you say it on and
[58:09] off ramp get into or get out to
[58:11] something um but what if it gets so big
[58:14] for example you had the the the Facebook
[58:17] example um what I hated about Facebook
[58:19] is that it was the way to contact
[58:23] strangers but what if I don't want to
[58:25] use Facebook but I want to use something
[58:27] else and it's like no you need to
[58:28] download Facebook but yeah I don't want
[58:31] people to have or to have the feeling
[58:33] that they're like yeah but then you need
[58:35] to use Bitcoin it needs to be a choice
[58:37] and there need to be other Alternatives
[58:39] that are also working um because if
[58:42] Bitcoin is not more by choice but is
[58:45] forced then I don't think Bitcoin is
[58:48] what it needs to be um and it needs to
[58:52] be a choice that
[58:53] is um that or that is experienced by
[58:57] people as the better choice and I think
[58:59] that's a really hard place to uh to keep
[59:03] you know it's like performing on athlete
[59:05] level constant and proving that you are
[59:08] the better choice um but you're not
[59:10] obliging people to to make that choice
[59:12] and I think with the miners and
[59:15] centralization problems that are maybe
[59:17] occurring because it's not sure if if if
[59:21] if that will really be like a bigger
[59:23] problem um then I think we will have
[59:27] like a big problem where you don't have
[59:29] yeah you don't really have a choice
[59:31] because the transactions can be flagged
[59:33] or they can be um like um not put in the
[59:37] or not accepted in the blocks and
[59:40] um yeah then I think if you need to use
[59:43] a specific template or
[59:45] whatever then it becomes really hard you
[59:47] know so
[59:49] um yeah I'm just trying to look at all
[59:51] the different things that I I I don't
[59:54] like in the development of Bitcoin U
[59:57] because I love it so much and I want it
[59:58] to succeed
[60:01] um yeah in in better display bitcoiners
[60:06] are the best critics of Bitcoin I I I I
[60:09] I I do know that like it's um every time
[60:13] I talk with someone that isn't a
[60:15] bitcoiner and they uh are trying to
[60:18] attack Bitcoin um I'm very calm because
[60:22] I know they haven't studied it if you
[60:26] study Bitcoin long enough you know even
[60:28] if you have criticisms on it you know
[60:31] you better have some Bitcoin there are
[60:34] people that say like 10% of Bitcoin like
[60:36] 50% of Bitcoin like if you have if you
[60:40] are if you study Bitcoin and you have
[60:44] understanding of the monetary system of
[60:46] gold of like the problem and the whole
[60:48] ecosystem around it there's no way you
[60:53] give Bitcoin 0% chance and then there's
[60:55] no way you give Bitcoin a 0% allocation
[60:59] uh so if someone criticizes Bitcoin and
[61:01] has zero Bitcoin I know his arguments
[61:04] are probably very very bad at least I
[61:08] haven't uh found someone that has good
[61:12] arguments against Bitcoin and has no
[61:15] Bitcoin usually the best arguments
[61:17] against Bitcoin are coming from people
[61:19] that have Bitcoin because they actually
[61:22] studied Bitcoin which is super
[61:23] fascinating to thing to see that the
[61:25] best critics of Bitcoin are Bitcoin
[61:29] themselves um but yeah like that's
[61:31] that's super interesting from like
[61:33] Financial
[61:35] Risk um uh yeah if you look at the
[61:38] Financial Risk approach like even if you
[61:41] hate Bitcoin but you're smart in finance
[61:43] then you should even have like just a
[61:46] little bit because you know you need to
[61:48] hatch yourself because what if you're
[61:50] wrong then it wouldn't also so it's
[61:53] always wise to have some Bitcoin
[61:56] uh from Financial Risk perspective but
[61:58] yeah that's a whole different discussion
[62:00] yeah that the biggest risk in Bitcoin is
[62:02] not having any Bitcoin exactly yeah yeah
[62:07] so yeah that that's super interesting
[62:10] but but how do how do you look at like
[62:12] the developments if you look at like for
[62:14] example
[62:16] 2021 I think is one no let's begin with
[62:19] 2020 when we saw that like more
[62:21] institutions were getting involved in
[62:23] Bitcoin and now in 2024 we saw like the
[62:26] ETFs coming in um we saw like options on
[62:29] ETFs and now 2025 like States discussing
[62:34] a strategic Bitcoin Reserve I was like
[62:37] and I read the bills and I was like oh
[62:39] man these are like these are like so
[62:42] it's so cool to see because everything
[62:43] that we used to talk about that it's
[62:45] it's happening you know it's actually
[62:47] happening it's uh super interesting and
[62:50] it kind of goes back to to my whole Fe
[62:52] is kind of confirming of like I think
[62:54] Bitcoin is the under like protocol and
[62:57] everyone else is doing their own little
[62:59] stuff on top of it so the the there
[63:02] there are people that are hardcore
[63:04] privacy Maxis and they don't want to do
[63:07] do have any do thing to do with kyc they
[63:10] don't want to have to do anything with
[63:11] fear and they are completely out of the
[63:13] field system and doing their Bitcoin
[63:15] thing um with PTP exchanges uh with with
[63:20] uh mixing and all those things but then
[63:22] there's um people that launch meme coins
[63:25] on top of Bitcoin then there are people
[63:27] that develop the layers to on bitcoin
[63:30] then there are people that put it on the
[63:31] balance sheet then there are people that
[63:33] even talk about uh then there are people
[63:37] that use Bitcoin as uh for an election
[63:41] program to get elected and then they put
[63:43] it on the balance sheet of the country
[63:45] and it's just seems to be the us being
[63:48] the first mover in that regard I know
[63:50] Surinam has I know uh ban has Bitcoin El
[63:54] salador has Bitcoin but a major way
[63:56] America would be the first one to do it
[63:58] officially uh so so that's kind of the
[64:02] the whole feis of mine is is kind of
[64:04] playing out in in real time and it's uh
[64:07] honestly shocking how fast it is going
[64:11] I'm uh amazed of like uh how quick and
[64:15] how good this whole process is is doing
[64:18] and honestly I I didn't thought it's
[64:21] going that quick uh in in in Bitcoin I'm
[64:25] kind of shocked at the level and the
[64:28] speed and the rate of of of adoption uh
[64:31] and the nation state uh level is just
[64:34] like crazy for for me that we already
[64:37] there it's if you look at the adoption
[64:40] Cycles we are now in the beginning of
[64:42] the store of value adoption phase so
[64:45] it's crazy to see that people already
[64:46] use it of immed immediate exchange
[64:48] because that's like way further down the
[64:50] line um but even the store of value
[64:53] phase is still not even close to finish
[64:56] finish there's like those three scurve
[64:59] adoptions the first is like store of
[65:01] value that me of exchange and then unit
[65:02] of account and it's all like small esur
[65:05] adoptions and the first one is still uh
[65:08] uh one that is currently ramping up so
[65:11] I'm amazed how quick it's actually going
[65:14] uh how do you look at that yeah I wrote
[65:17] an article I think uh I was trying to
[65:19] look into it but I I think I know it
[65:21] from the head like a little bit uh about
[65:23] the Bitcoin and crypto adoption in in
[65:25] Europe and I think uh we saw like a
[65:29] doubling of the adoption in most
[65:31] countries except for the Netherlands
[65:33] where we're had it or I think still
[65:35] saying at 6% I think we're heading
[65:37] toward seven um but then the question of
[65:40] course is do they possess Bitcoin or is
[65:43] it like other digital assets that they
[65:46] are that are owning right now um but
[65:50] eventually I think that more and more
[65:52] people
[65:53] will have to look into Bitcoin also
[65:56] because if you look
[65:57] at yeah if you look at other if you look
[66:00] at other projects and and you study and
[66:03] then you come to the conclusion that it
[66:05] doesn't make sense to not want to save
[66:08] in
[66:09] Bitcoin um but yeah I think that the
[66:12] nation state part is
[66:14] like um it's something that we all
[66:19] foresaw and oh yeah just this a funny
[66:22] one if you look at the like the Bitcoin
[66:24] show it was a conference I think it was
[66:26] in 2011 and I watched it on YouTube um
[66:30] I'll send it to you the the link this is
[66:32] something that you need to everybody
[66:34] that is a bitcoiner that needs to watch
[66:37] that conference it's called the Bitcoin
[66:39] show and if you search it I think it
[66:42] only has like 5,000 views or 400 it so
[66:46] so it's it's something that you really
[66:47] need to see um and there they were
[66:51] discussing like how Bitcoin should grow
[66:54] already and the IDE that they had back
[66:57] then um and that's what I like about
[66:59] Bitcoin is that there there was and
[67:01] still is a long-term vision and I think
[67:04] that's the thing that Bitcoin teaches
[67:06] you like if you have a long-term vision
[67:08] and you stick to the plan um then you
[67:11] can make sure that we can actually solve
[67:14] problems and um I was already thinking
[67:18] of like for example when we'll see the
[67:20] first uh start where people use Bitcoin
[67:23] as a as a story for Value then at the
[67:27] end nation states will depend on it and
[67:32] in my opinion we will see taxes flowing
[67:35] towards mining companies because they
[67:38] have an incentive because the system
[67:39] will become so big that we need to pay
[67:41] taxes as a community to make sure that
[67:44] Bitcoin will still work um so in my
[67:48] opinion that is something that we will
[67:50] definitely see in the next 10 to 15
[67:52] years that countries are like look at or
[67:56] trying to develop a strategy where um
[68:00] everybody has an incentive to make
[68:02] Bitcoin better or to make sure that
[68:04] Bitcoin will keep uh keep working yeah
[68:07] that's it's like once Bitcoin gets to a
[68:09] level where it's kind of crucial to for
[68:12] society all of the sudden uh governments
[68:15] and nation states are trying to protect
[68:17] it and trying to like mine it themselves
[68:19] and like run maybe full noes themselves
[68:22] to like protect the decentralization of
[68:24] it against nation states this whole
[68:28] whole game theory that's a that's a
[68:30] whole another point of like oh like when
[68:32] we come to that that it gets crazy scary
[68:36] fast that option but then again because
[68:39] if you think of like the the um all the
[68:43] wars that are currently going on and I'm
[68:45] not talking about the physical Wars but
[68:47] more like the the digital Wars that are
[68:49] going on like cables being cut off in
[68:51] oceans and
[68:53] um people being tapped like you'll see
[68:58] that in Bitcoin as well um especially
[69:00] and I think that if nation states adopt
[69:03] Bitcoin then that will also be like a
[69:05] huge problem like how will you protect
[69:07] your your
[69:10] country um and that is something that I
[69:12] think bitcoiners are already because I
[69:15] I'm forgetting the name but um a
[69:17] discussion that occurred already like um
[69:21] the then it becomes way more important
[69:23] to protect Bitcoin in a way that we've
[69:25] never thought about before um because
[69:28] it's so easy right now to see hackers
[69:30] and hackers doing stuff but what is it
[69:32] when the physical infrastructure depends
[69:34] on it as well in a country um so yeah
[69:39] just just some questions and there will
[69:41] probably be someone that is like oh this
[69:43]  what is he talking about in the
[69:44] comments later but there are just all
[69:47] I'm thinking of like tons of scenarios
[69:50] where uh Bitcoin becomes big and the the
[69:52] things that we need to solve and I'm
[69:54] hoping that there are because there are
[69:55] a lot of smart people and I I I love to
[69:58] read for example books and articles that
[70:01] adum from weird is writing um and
[70:03] Andreas anonops that come up with like
[70:06] such cool stuff um but then when you
[70:10] read it it it it blows your mind and
[70:12] you're also like thinking of all the new
[70:13] things that could happen
[70:16] um but yeah I'm babbling that I that
[70:21] that's
[70:21] super I I would I would I would not call
[70:24] it babbling even like I never heard the
[70:26] word babbling so I'm not sure what what
[70:28] babbling is yeah I it's like like
[70:30] talking gibberish in a way that doesn't
[70:32] make sense oh it makes a lot of sense
[70:34] for me honestly it's it's it's really
[70:37] really interesting because um I do
[70:40] sometimes get the criticism of uh having
[70:43] only extreme Bulls on my podcast uh
[70:47] which is just not true because I had
[70:49] some I even had a gold buug on on the
[70:52] show who had altcoins and who had only
[70:55] like 5 10% allocation to bitcoin and had
[70:58] most of it gold and altcoins and stuff
[71:00] like that so I definitely had people on
[71:03] that uh were not fully into Bitcoin and
[71:07] hyperboles and he brought up a lot of
[71:10] things against Bitcoin uh that he thinks
[71:13] will will go wrong um but
[71:17] uh but it's interesting to to still have
[71:20] those FS on but it's just so hard to
[71:23] find good critics of Bitcoin because if
[71:25] you really study Bitcoin
[71:27] hard you you kind of get to be a really
[71:30] hyper bull especially for your life like
[71:33] all the things that we are talking about
[71:35] where Bitcoin is going wrong we canot we
[71:38] cannot even really describe what's going
[71:41] wrong there because when we think about
[71:43] okay uh maybe there's a better Bitcoin
[71:47] but there's nothing that shows that
[71:49] currently like we cannot Point towards
[71:52] like a small thing that's like okay this
[71:54] might replace Place Bitcoin there's
[71:56] nothing that I can like or like this
[71:58] altcoin might actually be better uh we
[72:01] can only feel like okay like if we have
[72:04] multiplanetary species or if there's
[72:07] some Black Swamp that by definition we
[72:09] don't know about comes and there's a
[72:12] problem that's so big then it comes
[72:14] Bitcoin so like I think to that point
[72:16] it's like just so hard to see Bitcoin
[72:18] fail and that's why we get in this
[72:20] hyperb uh thing so I do like when there
[72:23] is some questions coming up and
[72:26] challenges coming up in inside with
[72:29] Bitcoin I just don't want to invite
[72:31] people on the podcast that don't
[72:33] understand Bitcoin that's the only thing
[72:35] H and it's hard to find people that are
[72:38] um raising a lot of questions on bitcoin
[72:41] and still understanding most of them are
[72:43] actually developers like most of the
[72:45] people that I meet that are really
[72:47] critical of the developments of Bitcoin
[72:49] uh usually and still understand Bitcoin
[72:52] and still have a lot of Bitcoin those
[72:54] are usually developers uh uh that worked
[72:59] on bitcoin on the main chain uh those
[73:01] are usually the best critics of Bitcoin
[73:04] maybe just because I don't understand
[73:05] what they're
[73:07] saying yeah I tried to listen to a few
[73:11] um I think the uh uh you know sh proost
[73:16] he's like a he's a d Bitcoin Bitcoin
[73:18] core
[73:20] developer uh yeah he has a nice podcast
[73:22] I think it's called um Bitcoin explained
[73:26] and I think he's yeah he's doing the
[73:28] podcast with Adam V weird I mean he he
[73:30] used to write maybe he's still writing
[73:31] for Bitcoin magazine and he wrote an
[73:33] amazing book The the Genesis book um
[73:37] where you I think I heard about that
[73:39] book yeah yeah yeah oh love it the way
[73:43] Adon writes he he just he just makes
[73:45] like such a nice story of Bitcoin and he
[73:48] gives you like um he gives you like like
[73:52] small rabbit holes every time and they
[73:55] you're like okay but I I I cannot dive
[73:57] into it right now so then you're reading
[73:58] a lot but then eventually when you
[74:00] finish the book you have like tons of
[74:02] other research that you can do so that's
[74:03] why I really love the way he's writing
[74:06] um but go and if yeah if you would like
[74:09] Bitcoin explain because it's in English
[74:11] I think um and then they explain tons of
[74:14] bibs and um yeah how the technology
[74:17] behind Bitcoin actually works from
[74:18] developers perspective and so that's
[74:21] really cool to do um but then again we
[74:24] also need to make sure that people
[74:26] understand it and that's why I think
[74:27] that bitcoiners could use more analogies
[74:30] and that's why it's fun to to to visit
[74:33] like when we went to El Salvador you
[74:34] know I still have a bracelet uh when we
[74:38] went to the education Meetup um where
[74:41] there was also like a talk about how to
[74:43] use analogies and make sure that people
[74:45] understand it but I think we also could
[74:47] make it more visual for people so they
[74:49] can
[74:50] see um they can see Concepts AB
[74:53] absolutely I just want to show or
[74:55] something because uh it it just happened
[74:57] uh right when we were on the podcast I
[74:59] saw it when I was searching the video on
[75:02] on on YouTube I just hit the 14,000 on
[75:05] on
[75:07] YouTube I I I still celebrate every uh
[75:11] 1,000 to stop because it's so amazing
[75:13] for me to to see that so like but I just
[75:16] wanted to show that I don't do like I I
[75:20] don't I I I I don't do any uh subscriber
[75:24] specials anymore I'm like I'm like ah I
[75:26] don't I I I don't do that I sometimes
[75:28] make a post about it uh but once you get
[75:32] over 10,000 you feel stupid and silly if
[75:34] you still celebrate publicly every
[75:36] thousand uh step uh but I I still do
[75:42] that yeah but why would you feel stupid
[75:44] about it I I don't know it feels like
[75:46] once you get over thousand like first
[75:48] you celebrate every 100 steps from like
[75:51] 100 to a th then from thousand to 10,000
[75:54] you celebrate all the Thousand stabs and
[75:56] then from thousand to let's say 100,000
[75:58] you only step only celebrate the the the
[76:01] the 10,000 the stabs but it's like oh
[76:03] like I have to wait so long Now to
[76:05] celebrate
[76:06] things yeah but this is worth
[76:08] celebrating man yeah congrats yeah thank
[76:10] you so much yeah and it's growing in a I
[76:12] think the line is is nice slowly but
[76:15] growing up I think because you you were
[76:17] doing like um one episode a day right
[76:21] yeah I I did now uh the last 365 days so
[76:25] that's literally one year uh and as you
[76:27] can see I had one year ago 500 followers
[76:32] uh and now one year later I'm
[76:34] approaching the 15,000 so like I'm now
[76:36] at
[76:37] 14,000 yeah really cool
[76:40] consistency absolutely consistency and
[76:42] and and I think I started around here
[76:47] somewhere with like every day so like
[76:50] somewhere here in February February
[76:52] actually started we can see it um let's
[76:55] do since the starting of the podcast
[76:58] this was the 28th of 2023 This was oh
[77:04] why is it not working like this this was
[77:07] the starting of the podcast it's now a
[77:08] year and 72 days old uh and so when I
[77:13] started I had 200 uh subscribers so it
[77:17] was a an account where already had
[77:19] subscribers from a
[77:21] previous uh Venture uh of of the channel
[77:26] looks like the bull market
[77:29] 2017 uh no I I didn't even talk about
[77:32] Bitcoin I talked about stocks and I
[77:34] talked about uh no I'm saying growth
[77:38] oh thank you man uh thank you so much
[77:42] yeah like it's it's it's it's been it's
[77:45] been crazy uh to to to witness the
[77:48] growth and it's it's absolutely abnormal
[77:51] uh to to witness it but yeah I just
[77:53] wanted to once celebrate in the in the
[77:55] in the episode maybe I do that uh now
[77:57] like if if I come in the episode over
[77:59] the 5 over a thousand step I do it in
[78:02] the episode really cool um we are
[78:05] already over one hour it's it really
[78:07] flew by today the the the talk um is
[78:10] anything else that you want to like to
[78:12] to share with us before we come to the
[78:14] end routine I think we we spoke about a
[78:17] lot of things um we didn't spoke about a
[78:19] lot of education but yeah I think it's
[78:23] um I think it's it's important to
[78:25] mention that um we in the space need to
[78:29] keep educating people and uh we did a
[78:32] podcast in the Netherlands in Dutch
[78:34] about uh how to start a conversation
[78:38] about Bitcoin and how not to start a
[78:40] conversation about Bitcoin um so I think
[78:43] it's important that people need to think
[78:45] of how they start a conversation about
[78:48] Bitcoin um because I think Bitcoin is a
[78:51] thing that people need to choose and it
[78:53] doesn't need to be forced on people so
[78:56] that's something that I like to yeah I
[78:58] like to do in real life and something
[79:00] that I also want to give to other people
[79:02] like try to think of a solution uh in
[79:05] which you don't force Bitcoin on on
[79:08] people but that they choose Bitcoin um
[79:11] yeah that's it that's a powerful one
[79:14] yeah like uh and and I also experienced
[79:16] that it does not work forcing things on
[79:18] bit uh vering Bitcoin on on on people
[79:21] it's it it kind of pushes them away more
[79:24] away from from Bitcoin it's it's not the
[79:27] intent of of of Bitcoin yeah really cool
[79:29] um we have one question for each and
[79:31] every one of the of my guests and the
[79:33] question is what can we learn from you
[79:35] besides Bitcoin I guess playing football
[79:37] I would say playing football but I can
[79:40] also do like fun uh like the they call
[79:44] it like the brain training tricks you
[79:45] know I can do like this and then what is
[79:48] that so you can try to do it yeah like
[79:50] keep your thumb up and point to your
[79:53] thumb with your other finger then switch
[79:56] them it's not that easy it's pretty hard
[79:59] to do so I can do stuff like that
[80:05] easily yeah try try to practice that one
[80:07] so that's a thing yeah Al like those are
[80:10] kind of hard exactly yeah oh yeah like
[80:13] you can do that also
[80:15] interesting H for for the people that
[80:18] that just listening might be weird to to
[80:21] listen to that uh but yeah like we we we
[80:24] try to do weird things with our fingers
[80:26] thank you so much for already for for
[80:29] being on ra we have entertaining podcast
[80:31] where the previous guest is asking a
[80:32] question for the next guest without
[80:34] knowing who the next guest is um and the
[80:36] previous guest asked you the question um
[80:40] what's a bitcoin company which is most
[80:42] needed right now it's a good question
[80:45] yeah then I would say
[80:48] probably yeah because that's why I'm in
[80:50] the field like and I'm doing it for over
[80:52] four years right now and it's it's I
[80:55] think it it
[80:56] will yeah I think it's necessary for the
[80:58] industry to grow bigger so I would say a
[81:01] real Bitcoin education company like for
[81:03] example me Premier Bitcoin needs to get
[81:07] bigger
[81:09] um so I would
[81:11] say
[81:13] education but of course like Yeah from
[81:16] what perspective are we looking at that
[81:17] question you know um it's a good
[81:20] question though and there's not one
[81:22] answer to but because I mean like the
[81:24] education field and I would say
[81:25] education because I think it's very
[81:27] important because it would teach you
[81:28] about all the companies that are
[81:30] necessary and so maybe that's the answer
[81:34] I love that yeah there's there's there's
[81:36] so many it's it's always hard if like
[81:39] there's a question of like so many
[81:40] different possibilities but it it's also
[81:43] really good because it makes you think
[81:44] and it's like kind of forces you to
[81:46] choose uh the the best one uh that that
[81:49] fits for for for what you are thinking
[81:51] about yeah really cool uh thank you so
[81:53] much for for being on before I let you
[81:55] go where can people find you ask your
[81:57] questions and reach out to
[81:58] you uh well yeah you can find me at
[82:01] crypto Takis um so yeah it's it's a
[82:04] little bit slang in the Netherlands but
[82:05] Krypto Takis is the platform we have an
[82:07] Instagram page Tik Tok a
[82:10] LinkedIn um and if you want to search me
[82:12] on LinkedIn you can also find me there
[82:14] and I also have a telegram but it's kind
[82:16] of private my telegram so I'm not
[82:19] sharing I'm not sharing that one over
[82:22] here yeah that that that that's great
[82:25] unfortunately my telegram I promote it
[82:28] now because there are so many spams and
[82:32] accounts going on with other telegram
[82:35] channels that are not mine that kind of
