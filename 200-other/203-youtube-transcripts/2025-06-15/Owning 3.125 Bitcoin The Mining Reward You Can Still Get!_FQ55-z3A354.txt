--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] the person who found the block this time
[00:02] appears to be using a bid ax Ultra which
[00:04] is an old model it's like over a year
[00:07] old and the cool thing about Bitcoin
[00:09] mining is uh you can't fake it so you
[00:11] can set up a pool where people
[00:14] contribute their hash rate and the pool
[00:16] can keep track of who sent how much hash
[00:19] rate and there's no way to fake it it
[00:21] still has the pool name but you're
[00:23] you're not pooling anything like you're
[00:24] you're completely self- Sovereign top to
[00:27] bottom uh that in my mind is the the
[00:29] best way to do it the first ever Public
[00:32] Announcement of Bitcoin he said I've
[00:35] generated a open-source peer-to-peer
[00:38] online currency open source was in the
[00:41] headline and I think that that's a very
[00:43] important point for Bitcoin bid X is a
[00:46] open-source Asic based Bitcoin miner is
[00:50] much smaller it's 15 watts it's quiet
[00:53] it's cool you know I've got some running
[00:55] on the desk here next to me you probably
[00:57] can't hear it they're super quiet it's
[00:59] it's it's a different way of doing
[01:01] things and in my opinion it's the right
[01:03] way to do
[01:04] [Music]
[01:07] it then hi Scott how you doing
[01:10] everything fine on your end everything
[01:11] is doing good it's doing good it's been
[01:13] a a crazy week so far and it's just
[01:16] getting started but uh yeah you you told
[01:18] me there's some uh like a second block
[01:21] was found or something like that yes on
[01:24] Monday uh a bidx uh found a block a
[01:28] solar mind a block
[01:30] which is the the second time it's
[01:32] happened it happened uh last summer and
[01:35] so it's been like 200 and so days uh but
[01:40] it yeah it happened again it's it's
[01:42] amazing it's really amazing to see it's
[01:45] it's like uh the device costs what what
[01:49] does the device cost1
[01:51] EUR I mean there's no set price um kind
[01:54] of the way bid ax works is anyone who
[01:57] wants to make it and sell it can and
[02:00] they also set the price so I think you
[02:04] know uh they kind of seem to to fall in
[02:07] the like
[02:09] $150 category um some more some less
[02:13] depending on what model you have the
[02:16] person who found the block this time
[02:18] appears to be using a Bida Ultra which
[02:21] is an old model it's like over a year
[02:24] old so I don't know what they originally
[02:26] paid for it but now you could probably
[02:28] get them for $100
[02:30] interesting so they they had uh an an
[02:34] bidex Pro paid like1 $150 for it and
[02:38] electricity cost is I don't know like
[02:40] doesn't need a lot of electricity this
[02:42] those things right that's correct yeah
[02:45] they they use 15 watts especially those
[02:48] older ones were used less power so 15
[02:51] watts that's like a you know an iPad
[02:53] charger kind of thing uh depending on
[02:56] what your electricity costs you you're
[02:59] probably in
[03:00] a couple dollars a month to run a bid ax
[03:04] like that
[03:06] 247 interesting and and so like if you
[03:10] ran it for a year or even if he would
[03:13] run it for like two three years uh let's
[03:15] say like 10 bucks it's like 100 it's
[03:19] like maximum cost like that and highly
[03:22] uh like if if we really try to get the
[03:25] cost as high as possible in our guessing
[03:28] it might have give him like $300 or $400
[03:32] for that bid X and now he found a a
[03:35] block what is the blog reward free
[03:38] Bitcoin
[03:40] crazy yeah I mean this is an extremely
[03:43] lucky case for a single bit a I think
[03:46] this person was actually running six bit
[03:47] axes but this is an extremely lucky case
[03:50] you know most people will
[03:52] run a bit a their entire life and not
[03:55] solve a block I mean not to to uh be a
[03:58] downer about it but you're are not good
[04:00] it's a lottery so in this case they
[04:03] certainly made a return on their
[04:04] investment but that's not guaranteed of
[04:07] course absolutely and I want to get into
[04:09] maybe different strategies for home
[04:11] Mining and solo mining IND there but I
[04:13] think before we we do that we have to
[04:16] clarify for people that might not know
[04:18] what is a bid X and and why are you
[04:20] passionate about it a bid X is a
[04:25] open-source Asic based Bitcoin miner so
[04:29] A6 are are the chips that are
[04:32] specifically made to do Bitcoin mining
[04:35] uh any Bitcoin miner that you come
[04:37] across these days is based around A6 the
[04:41] chips the bid ax is one of these it's uh
[04:45] it's a lot smaller than your traditional
[04:47] Bitcoin miner your traditional Bitcoin
[04:48] minor I don't know if you can see them
[04:50] behind me I've got a couple of them
[04:51] stacked up but they are large they will
[04:55] use 3 kilow uh of power to run which is
[05:00] a lot right think
[05:02] like you know hair dryers like multiple
[05:05] hair dryers will will be up there
[05:07] probably like four hair dryers five hair
[05:09] dryers and then the other thing is
[05:11] they're also as loud and as hot as that
[05:14] many hair dryers because they are
[05:16] dissipating all that electrical power as
[05:18] heat and they have loud fans to cool
[05:22] them they're not something you would
[05:24] plug in in a residential setting um
[05:27] unless you want to get a divorce so a
[05:30] the bid ax is is smaller it is much
[05:33] smaller it's 15 watts it's quiet it's
[05:36] cool you know I've got some running on
[05:38] the desk here next to me you probably
[05:40] can't hear it they're super quiet the
[05:43] catch is that they have much lower hash
[05:46] rate
[05:47] so your payout uh from Bitcoin mining is
[05:51] going to be directly related to the hash
[05:52] rate so these have much lower hash rate
[05:55] much lower payout so much so that people
[05:58] tend to do what's called Lottery mining
[06:00] where they just mine they solo mine uh
[06:04] and they don't share the rewards with
[06:06] anyone in a pool and in that situation
[06:09] you kind of get All or Nothing uh you
[06:12] could but if you do win it's like the
[06:14] lottery there's a huge payout you just
[06:15] have really poor chances but the bid a
[06:18] itself is probably more importantly is
[06:21] an open- source
[06:23] project this is important because
[06:26] Bitcoin is intrinsically open source
[06:29] that's one of the reasons I believe why
[06:31] it is successful is because there isn't
[06:34] um it's not proprietary there's not one
[06:37] company behind it it's it's open anyone
[06:39] can work on it it's an open
[06:40] permissionless network so the bidx tries
[06:43] to follow those ideals and be open and
[06:46] permissionless and allow anyone to who
[06:48] wants to to dig in and figure out how it
[06:50] works whether they want to repair the
[06:52] minor or build their own minor firmly
[06:54] believe this is how we get ahead and we
[06:57] do it in a decentralized way
[07:00] uh I think open source is fundamentally
[07:04] decentralized so that in that you know
[07:06] in that vein the bid ax is it's not a
[07:10] company it's an open- source project
[07:12] like a lot of things in Bitcoin it's
[07:13] just the source is out there uh people
[07:17] can pick it up and make one for
[07:20] themselves they can make a hundred and
[07:21] sell them to their friends they can make
[07:23] thousands and start a business selling
[07:25] them it's an open source project uh and
[07:29] it's has been pretty popular lately I
[07:31] think well I know that we've had Asic
[07:35] based Bitcoin miners for over a decade
[07:39] but the Bida is the First open- Source
[07:41] one ever which is kind of ridiculous but
[07:45] that's that's how it's been
[07:46] traditionally we're kind of shaking up
[07:50] the mining industry in a like Grassroots
[07:53] kind of way obviously with these low
[07:55] hash rate miners we're not going to be
[07:59] taking anything away from the big Mega
[08:02] miners not anytime soon but it's a
[08:04] Grassroots effort it's it's a a
[08:06] revolution and people are starting
[08:09] people are starting to do this it's
[08:10] getting pretty popular we've seen
[08:11] followon projects uh miners with higher
[08:14] hash rate we've seen established
[08:17] companies in the space starting to think
[08:18] about oh maybe open source is important
[08:21] yeah and it's it's been pretty popular
[08:23] and a bidx the second bitx that we know
[08:25] about uh solved to
[08:27] block uh earlier this week which is
[08:31] always a very exciting time it's very
[08:33] motivating and I see I think we have
[08:35] lots of people that uh kind of like oh
[08:38] yeah maybe maybe this project is going
[08:39] somewhere that's super interesting I
[08:41] like it how did it actually come to life
[08:43] like who started the that that bidex
[08:46] project and and how did it come what is
[08:47] kind of the original story of it well I
[08:50] started it uh I I I call myself the bidx
[08:54] instigator I started this project it uh
[08:57] several years ago I
[09:00] I wanted to have my own Asic Bitcoin
[09:03] miner um I I'm an electrical engineer by
[09:06] trade I've been working in this in the
[09:08] electronics Industry for a long time not
[09:10] in Bitcoin necessarily but I got I know
[09:14] how to do this stuff and I started
[09:16] getting into Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining
[09:17] and I thought like oh this would be
[09:19] great to make my own Miner just to
[09:20] figure out how it works and screw around
[09:22] with it so like several projects I've
[09:24] worked on in the past I just went and
[09:27] looked for open- Source plans like is
[09:29] there something out there I can build
[09:31] like just to kind of you know get my
[09:33] hands dirty and and dive in and there
[09:36] wasn't there wasn't anything there was
[09:37] no Open Source Hardware available there
[09:39] was some open- Source firmware but not
[09:42] much and uh I was like okay all right
[09:46] like I've done some reverse engineering
[09:48] before uh reverse engineering is for
[09:50] those who don't know is the process of
[09:52] figuring out how something works when
[09:55] you don't necessarily have any
[09:56] documentation or anything like that and
[09:58] so I've done some of this the hardware
[09:59] field before so I got myself some ant
[10:02] Miners and just started digging in to
[10:05] figure out how they work it was long
[10:07] process it's you know it's very tedious
[10:09] there's a lot of backstory to learn
[10:12] because you're you're trying to
[10:14] investigate pretty
[10:16] obscure um things like we just kind of
[10:20] you know we can use an oscilloscope or a
[10:22] logic analyzer to look at the signals on
[10:24] a minor to try and figure out what
[10:26] they're doing but to actually interpret
[10:27] that and and and and understand what it
[10:30] means I had to go way deep into the
[10:33] weeds and figure out you know how
[10:36] fundamentally does Bitcoin mining work
[10:39] what you know what is the significance
[10:41] of these signals that I'm
[10:43] seeing kind of spent you know while I
[10:45] was working my day job just spent a long
[10:48] time fussing around with it eventually
[10:50] started posting about it online on
[10:52] bitcoin talk and met some collaborators
[10:55] some other people who were like hey I'm
[10:56] very interested in this as well I'm also
[10:58] pretty skilled as far as electronics and
[11:02] firmware goes and they wanted to help
[11:04] out and so we dug in and and that's kind
[11:07] of when it started working um there's a
[11:10] lot of components to this and and I got
[11:12] a lot of help from a lot of smart people
[11:14] and the the group started to grow and
[11:16] bidex started to grow
[11:18] and beginning of
[11:22] 2024 I got a grant uh and started
[11:25] working on bidx full-time and around
[11:28] that time
[11:30] we the community started getting really
[11:31] big lots of great contributors I think
[11:34] that's partly because it's an open
[11:36] source project and people want to help
[11:40] and they can they don't need to ask
[11:41] anyone for permission they can just jump
[11:43] in and contribute so it it is a lot
[11:46] bigger than just me now but I started it
[11:49] couldn't have done it with all without
[11:51] the help of many extremely talented
[11:55] collaborators though that's super
[11:57] interesting um and I maybe get now into
[12:01] the strategies but but I also want to
[12:03] get in the in the open source topic a
[12:05] little later um there's this Lottery
[12:09] aspect of it where you keep all the
[12:12] rewards for yourself if you get
[12:13] something uh and then there's like or
[12:16] you share it with a other group of
[12:18] people where your reward where you get
[12:20] something back but it's not as much um
[12:23] probably with like something like ocean
[12:25] or something like that um uh those are
[12:27] the two basic strategies you can with
[12:29] your with your bidex from what I
[12:31] understand right that's right that's
[12:34] right exactly I mean those are the two
[12:37] sort of most popular strategies that
[12:40] have emerged you can do whatever you
[12:42] want which is kind of cool that's what I
[12:43] like about it but pooled Mining and solo
[12:47] mining are kind of the the two go-to
[12:50] strategies I would say and pooled Mining
[12:54] works like you you go to Ocean and you
[12:57] get like a small
[13:00] uh uh lightning uh rewards from from
[13:03] what I
[13:04] understand pulled refers to kind of how
[13:08] you deal with the rewards uh in a in a
[13:12] pooled situation the term comes from
[13:16] like a lottery pool I think you know and
[13:19] in there might be a group that gets
[13:21] together and like Hey we're all going to
[13:22] buy lottery tickets and if any one of us
[13:24] wins we're going to split the rewards
[13:26] amongst all of us so we're kind of like
[13:29] increasing our
[13:30] chances um decreasing our risk
[13:33] decreasing our payout but increasing our
[13:35] chance so that's kind of how it works
[13:38] with Bitcoin mining you say all right
[13:39] we're all going to point our hash rate
[13:42] towards a central
[13:44] pool and then any rewards we get we're
[13:47] going to then split that up amongst
[13:49] everyone who contributed hash rate and
[13:52] the cool thing about Bitcoin mining
[13:55] is uh you can't fake it so you can set
[13:59] up a pool where people contribute their
[14:01] hash rate and the pool can keep track of
[14:05] who sent how much hash rate and there's
[14:07] no way to fake it and so then when they
[14:09] get a reward they can just divide that
[14:11] reward up amongst everyone based on how
[14:14] much hash rate they contributed and
[14:16] there's a bunch of different payout
[14:17] schemes probably heard of things like
[14:19] fpps PPS pplns ocean has something
[14:23] called Tides those are just different
[14:26] ways to divide up that reward and pay it
[14:29] out um based on who contributed what so
[14:32] that's that's like a a mining
[14:34] pool now we have it gets really
[14:38] confusing because some of the solo
[14:39] mining uh setups are also called pools I
[14:43] think that's just sort of a a historical
[14:45] term that has carried over so we have CK
[14:49] pool we have public pool those are Solo
[14:53] mining which means that you're going it
[14:56] alone you're not splitting your rewards
[14:58] up amongst any anyone so you either get
[15:03] all the reward you know you get lucky
[15:05] and you get 100% of the reward for
[15:08] yourself but if you don't get any
[15:10] anything you get nothing if you don't if
[15:13] you don't solve any blocks you get no
[15:15] reward but they are still in in a pool
[15:18] together with other miners this is the
[15:20] this is the complicated part for
[15:23] historical reasons they're called pools
[15:25] um you know the the the difference here
[15:27] is that with public pool and CK pool
[15:30] there's a website where they host that
[15:33] software it's a stratum server it's what
[15:35] your minor connects
[15:37] to uh both public pool and CK pool have
[15:40] options where someone else on some other
[15:43] server can run that they're running a
[15:45] node they're constructing the block
[15:47] templates they're giving work to your
[15:48] minor and then they're taking the shares
[15:51] and submitting them on your behalf but
[15:53] they're not doing any uh div division
[15:56] they're not dividing up the rewards
[15:58] amongst anyone it's just you know each
[16:00] person for their for themselves so that
[16:02] that's that's called like a solo pool
[16:04] which is you know again we we there's no
[16:07] centralized body in Bitcoin so there's
[16:09] also no one like coming up with these
[16:11] terms they're just sort of developed you
[16:14] know by whoever makes something and
[16:16] whatever they call it which is confusing
[16:18] for people but
[16:21] uh that's that's kind of when you see
[16:24] like a solo pool that that just means
[16:26] traditionally that someone else is
[16:28] hosting the stratum server for you now
[16:32] you can go and get CK pool software solo
[16:36] pool software uh public pool software
[16:39] and run it yourself like you could set
[16:41] up your own node like on your own PC you
[16:44] could run that software on it and you
[16:48] could Point your miners at your own node
[16:51] now that is solo mining because you're
[16:53] not splitting your rewards with
[16:55] anyone
[16:57] um is still has the pool name but you're
[17:00] you're not pooling anything like you're
[17:02] you're completely self- Sovereign top to
[17:04] bottom uh that in my mind is the the
[17:07] best way to do it people can obviously
[17:09] do whatever they want but I think that
[17:11] that's a that's a great way to do mining
[17:14] it takes it takes some additional effort
[17:17] to set that up and keep it running and
[17:20] debug it when there's problems and
[17:21] things like that so terminology you are
[17:25] Solo solo mining I guess yes yeah I mean
[17:29] I I spent a lot of time developing the
[17:32] bid x uh including the the firmware that
[17:36] connects to these pools so I I do all of
[17:39] the above I I test out everything uh
[17:42] just to make sure that it works we one
[17:44] of the goals with the bidx is that we
[17:47] don't we don't prescribe any particular
[17:51] method we want people to make their own
[17:53] decisions and mine however they want
[17:56] whether that's solo whether that's
[17:58] pooled mine whether that's you know
[18:01] to you know ant poool which I wouldn't
[18:05] recommend but if you want to you can I
[18:08] think that that's really important for
[18:10] decentralization you know if we have all
[18:12] these minors out there and we have
[18:15] different people controlling them all
[18:17] they'll all make different decisions for
[18:20] themselves as how they want to mine and
[18:23] that's what's really important is
[18:24] because they'll make hopefully different
[18:27] decisions because they're different
[18:28] people
[18:29] and we'll get more uh we'll get more
[18:32] decentralization just by the mere fact
[18:34] that more people are in charge of how
[18:38] the mining machines are working know
[18:40] where like most bid xes are are pointed
[18:44] towards we don't we don't the it's a
[18:47] it's
[18:48] a very decentralized project the the bid
[18:53] ax itself does not phone home it doesn't
[18:56] send any statistics to me or anyone else
[19:00] um it it I I've been very adamant about
[19:03] the fact that your Bida only connects to
[19:07] the stratum server that you type in so
[19:10] it only connects to the pool that you
[19:11] type in we don't we don't query a Time
[19:14] server we don't query a licenser
[19:17] statistics like there there's an option
[19:21] if you if you specifically enable it to
[19:23] check for uh software updates but that
[19:26] doesn't happen automatically
[19:29] so no we we don't know anything I don't
[19:32] know how many bid AES are out there I
[19:34] don't know what they're
[19:36] doing you know we have there's popular
[19:41] pools like public pool and uh solo CK
[19:45] pool and we can see statistics there and
[19:49] so we can see that there's thousands of
[19:51] bit xes connected to public pool but we
[19:54] don't know you know what proportion of
[19:56] the total number of bit xes that are out
[19:59] there are doing that I have talked to
[20:02] this the main the I have talked to the
[20:05] larger manufacturers that I'm aware of
[20:07] to try and get a rough estimate of how
[20:09] many bit axes are out there I mean that
[20:11] would be great to know we can't know for
[20:14] sure because anyone can build them and
[20:16] put them out there but I think we're in
[20:18] the sort of like 25 to
[20:20] 30,000 bit
[20:22] axes sold that's my rough my rough guess
[20:26] but I don't know what how they're all
[20:28] mining like I said we we can tell that
[20:30] there's something like I I forget the
[20:32] current numbers we can tell that like
[20:34] six or 7 thousand of them are connected
[20:36] to public pool but that's you know
[20:40] that's not even half of what I suspect
[20:41] is out there that's that's the the the
[20:44] beauty but also the the the interesting
[20:49] part about open source uh it's like all
[20:51] those great statistics uh like how many
[20:53] did you sell like where are they pointed
[20:56] towards and then you can optimize the
[20:58] soft domain maybe for that a little bit
[21:00] uh and so you you might develop
[21:02] something in the software that actually
[21:04] nobody's
[21:05] using things like that it's it's a it's
[21:08] a it's a very different model from
[21:10] everything I've ever worked in before
[21:12] and and I think a lot of other people
[21:13] too is especially in Hardware just
[21:16] having it
[21:17] be uh decentralized and open it's really
[21:21] a different Paradigm than how Hardware
[21:24] is usually made which is like one
[21:26] company designs it they don't tell
[21:28] anyone it's made and they have a factory
[21:30] that builds all of them and they can
[21:31] keep pretty tight control over it all
[21:34] but you know it's different I think like
[21:38] Bitcoin itself it's it's a different way
[21:41] of doing things and in my opinion it's
[21:44] the right way to do it but yeah we
[21:46] there's a couple things like that where
[21:48] it's like it'd be really cool to know
[21:51] how many are out there and how well
[21:52] they're working but I won't uh I won't
[21:55] compromise on that um
[21:59] um control and anonymity that users can
[22:05] have with bitx you probably have some
[22:08] some mechanism uh or like people
[22:10] reaching out to you for reporting like
[22:13] user feedback and errors and and stuff
[22:15] like that because uh
[22:17] from I I was in software development uh
[22:20] for a few years and I know that our
[22:24] customers were always the ones where
[22:27] where we like okay they they they saw
[22:29] the mistakes and the small errors that
[22:30] we just didn't test for and like oh like
[22:33] that that's possible and it it was it
[22:35] was super fun uh to get that user
[22:38] feedback and error things and obviously
[22:40] we had a centralized system uh but with
[22:43] not having a centralized systems there's
[22:45] like it's probably more complicated and
[22:49] more uh to to get that user feedback and
[22:51] to get the Aro
[22:53] collection it really is we you know we
[22:56] have the sort of offici
[23:00] project is on GitHub GitHub has issues
[23:03] so people can it's actually open anyone
[23:05] can create an issue there and describe
[23:08] their problem lots of people do that we
[23:11] also have uh the osmu the open source
[23:14] miners United it's a a a large group at
[23:18] this point a Discord
[23:20] server we got like 7,000 people in there
[23:24] but that's a good place to talk about
[23:27] issue get help
[23:29] get you know talk about help with issues
[23:31] and I can sort of
[23:32] collect user sentiment you know how's it
[23:36] going from there but again this is a a
[23:39] big effort right someone has to like you
[23:41] know be motivated enough to notice they
[23:46] have a problem with their bidex join the
[23:48] Discord post about it in a coherent way
[23:51] and then you know keep doing that in
[23:54] aggregate so that these problems can get
[23:56] fixed you know that said we we have a
[23:58] lot of people working on it probably
[24:01] more people than you know a small
[24:05] hardware company would have we have a
[24:06] lot of talented Engineers that have got
[24:08] eyes on this all the time and they have
[24:11] they're up they're all around the world
[24:12] so they're up all the time and uh we're
[24:15] making a lot of progress on the
[24:18] reliability and usability of both the
[24:20] hardware and the firmware at a a crazy
[24:23] Pace in fact I had to tell someone the
[24:25] other day I was like okay guys let's
[24:28] only have software updates you know Max
[24:31] once a month because it was getting
[24:33] crazy we we were just adding features so
[24:35] fast which was great to see I don't
[24:37] really want to slow anyone down but I
[24:39] also don't want to like stress out Bida
[24:42] users when they like see a firmware
[24:44] update every week because it can be a
[24:46] can be a challenge to
[24:48] do um yeah there there's pros and cons
[24:52] to this to this method but I think we're
[24:54] doing pretty well for someone who's you
[24:58] know to buying an iPhone or some other
[25:03] iot device it can be a little strange
[25:07] because you know where did you get it
[25:09] from like there's there's scam sellers
[25:12] out there there's there's knockoff bti
[25:14] axes someone the other day was like my
[25:17] bid ax isn't working at all and I was
[25:18] like a man we're digging into it and
[25:20] then finally we saw a picture of it and
[25:22] it was not a bti AE at all I mean it was
[25:25] clearly based on a bti AE but it wasn't
[25:27] a bit AE someone had changed it and then
[25:30] the person was like oh I got it on Teemu
[25:33] you know that like super cheap stuff
[25:36] from China they got it there for
[25:37] presumably super cheap and it was
[25:39] like well I'm sorry you don't have a bid
[25:43] axe I don't know how that works I can't
[25:45] really help
[25:46] you uh so there's there's some pitfalls
[25:50] kind of kind of
[25:53] a wild wild system that I think some
[25:56] people will like
[25:58] other people will not like it what are
[26:00] you going to do do you have like um like
[26:03] a website or like on on GitHub where you
[26:07] you list verified shops for for people
[26:09] to like okay here can I actually buy it
[26:12] yeah so the the website that I set up
[26:14] for the project is Bid a.org and if you
[26:17] go there you can get some general
[26:19] information about the project including
[26:20] links to the GitHub repositories that
[26:23] have all the source code for the the
[26:26] different components uh different models
[26:28] and I also have a link of
[26:31] sellers a link to a page of sellers that
[26:34] I try and keep up to dat that that's
[26:37] been an interesting thing I kind of set
[26:40] that up originally when the project was
[26:41] just starting and there was only a
[26:43] couple sellers because it was really
[26:44] hard people were always asking me like
[26:46] where can I get a beted x and I you know
[26:48] initially I was like will you just make
[26:50] it and no one wanted to do that because
[26:52] it's kind of hard so people were like
[26:54] well where can I buy it so I set up a
[26:56] web page on bitx .org that just listed
[26:59] Sellers and sort of where in the world
[27:01] they were and I had a couple rules on
[27:04] there so in order to be on that list you
[27:07] need to follow the open source
[27:09] license there
[27:12] is uh there's an open source license
[27:14] that you you you have agreed to if
[27:16] you're making and selling BD xes you
[27:18] have agreed to this open source license
[27:20] whether you know it or not so I wanted
[27:22] sellers to follow that
[27:24] license
[27:25] um and I also had a couple addition
[27:28] rules like I didn't want people to be
[27:30] doing pre-sales for bid axes that
[27:34] weren't finished yet I wanted to make
[27:36] sure that sellers listed a link to the
[27:39] source the exact source of the bid act
[27:42] they're selling on on the web page so
[27:45] that anyone who buys one is aware of the
[27:48] fact that it's an open source project
[27:50] and that they can get the source for it
[27:53] if they want so those those are the
[27:55] rules I think that uh yeah there you go
[27:57] see if you click if you click on on buy
[28:00] up in the right hand corner there uh
[28:02] that goes to a list of sellers all
[28:04] around the world and people get confused
[28:07] and they think oh these are authorized
[28:08] sellers like I have somehow verified
[28:10] that they are um not going to scam you
[28:14] that that's not true all I have done
[28:17] is looked at their website to make sure
[28:20] that they follow those couple rules that
[28:22] they follow the open source license they
[28:23] link to the source and that's it so you
[28:25] have to be a little bit careful here
[28:27] like I don't have the ability to
[28:28] constantly monitor these sellers to make
[28:31] sure that they're you know being
[28:34] truthful or what their return policy is
[28:36] or anything like that so you can get
[28:38] burned but the idea is that you can sort
[28:41] by where you live and hopefully find a
[28:44] website that is near you and and get
[28:49] some bid access and and it's a way to
[28:52] pressure people into following the open
[28:55] source license like I don't have a
[28:56] budget for lawyers or anything anything
[28:58] like this so if people break the open
[28:59] source license there's not a whole lot I
[29:01] can do but what I can do is not include
[29:04] them on this list and I think that
[29:07] sellers on here have told me that they
[29:09] get a lot of traffic from this list so I
[29:11] think there's a there is an incentive to
[29:15] follow those rules those sort of
[29:17] community best practices and get
[29:19] included on this list let's take a break
[29:21] for a moment and appreciate the puty
[29:24] that coin vigilante has made with the
[29:27] Bitcoin watch
[29:28] those watches are the most amazing the
[29:31] most elegent way of showing that you are
[29:34] a true bitcoiner and coin vigilante just
[29:37] dropped a completely new and amazing
[29:40] Genesis edition of their watch
[29:43] collections you have the date of the
[29:45] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[29:48] and of course also the block height and
[29:51] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[29:54] level of detail they put in in this
[29:57] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[29:59] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[30:03] in the descriptions I love those watches
[30:05] so so much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[30:09] really do hope that you don't have it on
[30:11] Exchange but if you do have it on
[30:13] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[30:15] with that the first way is you put it on
[30:17] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[30:20] you to get into the self custody game I
[30:23] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[30:26] for that it's a super simple and secure
[30:29] way and if you check out the link in the
[30:31] description you even get 5% off if you
[30:34] use the code Robin and the second way is
[30:37] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[30:41] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[30:44] most out of your sovereignty they will
[30:47] personalize for you a self custody setup
[30:50] that is perfect for your individual
[30:53] situation they will show you how you can
[30:55] secure your own devices securing your
[30:58] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[31:00] keep all your devices secure one topic
[31:03] that is overlooked often is the
[31:05] inheritance plan what happens with your
[31:08] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[31:11] you have a plan for that in place
[31:13] already and last but not least if you're
[31:15] in a jurisdictions where you don't feel
[31:18] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[31:21] that head over do the Bitcoin way.com
[31:24] robobin to get a 30 minute free C all
[31:28] and just a quick side note I will be for
[31:30] the first time ever speaking at the
[31:33] Bitcoin Prague event in June it will be
[31:36] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[31:38] looking forward to seeing all of you
[31:40] there you can get your ticket in the
[31:42] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[31:45] brag and very important use code Robin
[31:48] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[31:51] looking forward seeing you there
[31:53] interesting yeah I mean there are like
[31:55] I'm just checking because uh I'm I'm
[31:57] Austria and so Austrian and Germany and
[31:59] there's even like from Austria one
[32:01] there's Germany one two whereas the
[32:05] third one there third on there from
[32:07] Switzerland one like there's a lot of uh
[32:11] sellers like I'm I I was not suspecting
[32:14] such a such a big list of of sellers
[32:17] actually I maybe the the the 30,000 is
[32:21] is
[32:23] conservative well you know there those
[32:26] sellers on there are
[32:28] a whole wide range uh there's a couple
[32:31] of people on there who probably are sold
[32:34] out because they don't H make a lot of
[32:37] bit axes they don't have them there's
[32:38] others on there that are going to move a
[32:40] lot of bit axes so you kind of have to
[32:43] do your own research
[32:44] there Germany though uh has a has a very
[32:49] strong bid ax following I think you
[32:51] interviewed uh my colleague W clue a
[32:54] little while back he he's an early
[32:56] contributor to to bid a he's a um a
[33:00] founding member of
[33:02] osmu and spends a lot of time working on
[33:05] this stuff the guy is amazing super
[33:07] smart lucky to have him but uh he
[33:12] actually invited me out to and some
[33:14] others uh from U out um about a year ago
[33:19] and we went to a Meetup in Munich and
[33:23] there was tons of people there yes
[33:25] there's Wu that guy's a badass he should
[33:27] definitely go check out his interview if
[33:29] you
[33:30] haven't uh there yeah there's there's a
[33:32] great Bitcoin scene in Germany and uh as
[33:37] a result I think a lot of them have
[33:39] joined in on bid
[33:41] ax and hopefully spreading that to uh
[33:45] neighboring
[33:47] countries in in the EU I mean we have we
[33:50] have other other countries that there's
[33:52] a uh Spain has uh a
[33:55] couple like badass Bitcoin uh you know
[34:01] Bitcoin related comp or bidx related
[34:04] companies uh an early contributor is
[34:06] based in Spain also so I think that's
[34:08] just kind of how these things get
[34:10] started that said if anyone wants to get
[34:13] involved I highly recommend it we could
[34:15] always use more sellers certainly um in
[34:18] other countries that aren't listed on
[34:20] the bid a.org website great to have bidx
[34:24] sellers start up there you know one of
[34:26] the problems is
[34:28] is always with these things is shipping
[34:31] cost uh import duties tariffs taxes
[34:35] things like that from things coming from
[34:37] different countries different sort of
[34:38] economic zones is is really a challenge
[34:41] so would love to have more people start
[34:44] up more local um bidx manufacturing and
[34:47] selling operation yeah maybe do you can
[34:50] even like get it at the Meetup or
[34:52] something like that if you have local
[34:53] things like that I think that's a great
[34:55] one also that is that is in fact I one
[34:59] of my goals for this year is to get more
[35:02] of that sort of in-person bid ax selling
[35:05] because that's really big you know you
[35:06] don't have to type your address into
[35:08] some form and then invariably get it
[35:11] stored in a database somewhere and maybe
[35:14] put in your credit card number or
[35:15] whatever I think in-person selling you
[35:18] know for Bitcoin ideally is fantastic
[35:21] and I would love to have people you know
[35:23] just fill up their backpack with a few
[35:25] and go to their local Meetup and get it
[35:27] in the hand of people and you can help
[35:28] them set it up right there that kind of
[35:30] thing interesting is bidex your like
[35:33] main or only project that you're
[35:34] currently doing it is my main project uh
[35:37] I'm working on uh this full-time under a
[35:41] very generous Grant from open
[35:43] SATs I also am working on some other
[35:47] projects that aren't bidx but they are
[35:50] open- Source Bitcoin mining Hardware
[35:52] that's that's my my focus now uh I've
[35:55] been working with the 250 6 Foundation
[35:59] which was started out of uh Bitcoin Park
[36:02] in Nashville it 26 Foundation aims to be
[36:06] a uh a granting organization to sort of
[36:10] stimulate and and um support people
[36:14] working on open- Source Bitcoin mining
[36:17] which as as soon as I heard they were
[36:19] starting that I was like I want in This
[36:21] Is My Jam so I I'm working on them with
[36:24] them helping to set up this foundation
[36:26] and I'm also the first Grant recipient
[36:28] of the foundation for a project called
[36:29] Ember one that I'm working on which is
[36:33] it's a it's also an open source Bitcoin
[36:35] minor it's a little bigger than the bid
[36:36] ax it's it's bigger than the bid ax but
[36:39] smaller than an ant minor it's a 100
[36:41] watt uh Asic hash board and we're going
[36:44] to do a couple different varieties with
[36:46] different chips on there but uh if you
[36:50] go to my uh GitHub there's tons of
[36:53] different projects that are in various
[36:55] stages of of completion so you can check
[36:57] those out I I like to work on tools for
[37:01] people who are hacking Bitcoin miners
[37:04] I've got a
[37:05] couple starts of projects there that are
[37:07] control boards for ant miners data
[37:10] cables Raspberry Pi hats things like
[37:13] that
[37:13] I in the process of of making the bid ax
[37:17] I've learned a lot about how ant miners
[37:20] work specifically and so I've created a
[37:22] couple other tools in that
[37:25] same uh same area yeah is that the right
[37:29] one uh Scott bitx yep that well so if
[37:34] you go to Just Scott that's my GitHub
[37:36] and and all the various projects that
[37:38] I'm working on will be there um I think
[37:41] if you go to like repositories
[37:44] anyways we have a lot of this stuff
[37:47] that's bid ax related is getting moved
[37:50] to a GitHub organization so it's not
[37:53] just based on me and my GitHub account
[37:57] so that's github.com
[37:59] bidx org instead of Scott it's it's bidx
[38:02] org all one word and that uh we're we're
[38:06] slowly but surely migrating things over
[38:09] here GitHub if you're an organization
[38:11] they give you sort of more fine grain
[38:13] control over multiple users and what
[38:16] their permissions are and stuff like
[38:17] that so here we've moved all of the bidx
[38:19] hardware repositories over here and so
[38:21] that's the bitx max gamma GT those are
[38:25] different models um some other tools are
[38:28] here ESP minor which is the firmware for
[38:31] bit axes will be moved here in the near
[38:34] future I like that really cool I I love
[38:37] that project and it's a it's a really
[38:40] good one um and the question that I
[38:43] actually kind of want to have ADD in the
[38:45] in the beginning but it was too
[38:46] interesting so I kind of forgot it yeah
[38:49] why is it so important to have Bitcoin
[38:52] mining open source and bring
[38:54] transparency in in this whole field of
[38:57] Bitcoin mining uh it's very important
[39:00] it's very important in my mind and I
[39:02] think a lot of other people's
[39:04] mind when Satoshi first announced
[39:08] Bitcoin the first ever Public
[39:11] Announcement of Bitcoin he said I've
[39:15] generated a open- source peer-to-peer
[39:18] uh online currency and so open source
[39:22] was in the headline and I think that
[39:23] that's a very important point for
[39:26] Bitcoin I think had Satoshi not made
[39:30] Bitcoin open source then we wouldn't be
[39:33] here talking about it I think one of the
[39:36] obviously there's a lot of other aspects
[39:38] of Bitcoin that are very important but I
[39:40] think open source is right there up with
[39:42] you know fixed Supply proof of
[39:45] work open source is right there because
[39:48] what it does is it it
[39:52] ures that the development is
[39:55] decentralized meaning that it's not
[39:58] controlled by one company it's not kept
[40:01] in secret as an example like if you
[40:04] wanted to work
[40:05] on a project like Microsoft Windows like
[40:10] you like I've got an idea for Microsoft
[40:12] Windows you you have to get a job at
[40:14] Microsoft like they don't publish the
[40:15] source for that you have to go there get
[40:17] a job and and all the you know you you
[40:22] have to get a lot of permission from
[40:24] different people to do that and even
[40:26] then sort of what you can what you can
[40:29] do is limited by all of the people at
[40:33] Microsoft and the you know the board of
[40:35] directors and all that good stuff so
[40:38] it's open source anyone can jump in on
[40:40] bitcoin and start working on it I mean
[40:43] Satoshi disappeared like pretty early on
[40:45] the project so if it wasn't open source
[40:48] it probably would have just died right
[40:50] there um but it wasn't the people who
[40:54] were working with Satoshi early on could
[40:57] take it and run with it we've we've all
[40:58] heard the stories those names of of the
[41:01] developers who took it and ran with it
[41:04] and then it just starts spreading you
[41:06] know it's it's that exponential growth
[41:08] like one person gives it to gives it to
[41:10] two people they give it to two people
[41:12] and next thing you know there's a lot of
[41:14] people working on it or at least looking
[41:17] at it and considering it and thinking
[41:19] about it it's open source is a
[41:22] fundamental part of
[41:23] Bitcoin I think that mining Bitcoin
[41:27] mining is obviously a very important P
[41:29] part of Bitcoin it's one of the the
[41:32] three pillars of how Bitcoin works I
[41:36] like to say that the three pillars of
[41:38] Bitcoin are uh
[41:40] nodes uh wallets that handle the
[41:44] transactions and Mining which you know
[41:47] people like to call it various different
[41:48] things but it secures the network to
[41:50] have this very important part of Bitcoin
[41:53] Bitcoin mining be totally closed source
[41:55] and proprietary is nuts like I don't
[41:58] understand why anyone like thinks that's
[42:01] acceptable you know think about these
[42:03] these large Mega mining corporations
[42:06] they are dealing millions of dollars a
[42:09] month and yet they don't know how these
[42:12] machines work there's just this other
[42:14] company bitmain that makes the Lion
[42:16] Share of Bitcoin miners that controls
[42:18] how they work that to me is insane we
[42:22] can't have this this Freedom money that
[42:26] is
[42:28] that has this you know very important
[42:31] part of how it works be developed in
[42:34] total secret we just don't know how it
[42:36] works and in fact bitmain who makes I
[42:38] don't know like 80% of the Bitcoin
[42:40] mining machines out
[42:42] there has has done sketchy stuff before
[42:46] they have tried to put things into their
[42:49] miners that we have found and you know
[42:53] confirmed like this is sketchy uh Asic
[42:56] boost ant
[42:58] bleed there's you know and these are
[43:00] just the things that we' found like what
[43:02] what are they doing that we don't know
[43:03] about it's it's no way to do this kind
[43:06] of thing it's it's not
[43:08] necessary um we need to get out of this
[43:11] proprietary Bitcoin mining mindset and
[43:14] and push towards open source I think
[43:17] there's a real chance of it happening
[43:18] too uh as as we move
[43:21] forward one of the reasons why I think
[43:24] Bitcoin mining became proprietary
[43:26] because it wasn't always so tooshi mined
[43:29] the first block and several after that
[43:31] using open- Source software that he
[43:34] published and then you know there was
[43:37] that was CPU Mining and then there was
[43:39] GPU and fpga Mining a lot of that was
[43:41] also open source it became closed Source
[43:44] in like 2012 or whenever it was when
[43:48] Asic miners started coming
[43:50] out it makes sense as6 are incredibly
[43:53] expensive like millions and millions of
[43:55] dollars just to think about developing
[43:57] your own Asic chip so it makes sense
[44:01] that they wanted to protect their
[44:02] investment and not necessarily just kind
[44:04] of share it with anyone right away but
[44:06] we're well past that that was that was a
[44:08] long time ago um in fact I think that if
[44:14] it still costs millions of dollars it's
[44:15] maybe even more expensive to develop
[44:17] your own Asic but you can keep that a
[44:21] secret and just sell chips to systems
[44:26] builders who then um Can publish how
[44:30] that system works open source and I
[44:32] think that's the best of both worlds is
[44:34] they can these people with these large
[44:35] initial investments in Asic development
[44:37] can keep that proprietary information
[44:39] for themselves but make chips available
[44:42] to the rest of us to build Miners and
[44:45] then we can make sure that those miners
[44:46] work in a way that's compatible with the
[44:50] decentralization of of Bitcoin so open
[44:55] source is important I think we'll I
[44:56] think we'll get get there do you think
[44:58] do you think that um a majority of
[45:01] mining will be open source like is is
[45:04] there like a future where we we get to
[45:07] the importance of we we have open source
[45:11] mining machines rather than the bit bit
[45:15] main proti uh
[45:17] systems oh I do
[45:20] definitely absolutely I think there's a
[45:21] number of reasons why we'll get there
[45:23] right now the Bitcoin mining industry is
[45:27] dominated by on grid miners who run
[45:30] their machines in data centers and as a
[45:34] result
[45:36] 99.9% of the mining machines that are
[45:40] developed are for that purpose you know
[45:45] we have a couple different manufacturers
[45:47] but for some reason all their machines
[45:48] look exactly the same they're that sort
[45:50] of like s19 form factor you know with
[45:52] the two fans in front the powerly on the
[45:54] side the control board on the top and
[45:57] that's because we've just landed on how
[46:00] these mining machines are run in data
[46:01] centers connected you know large data
[46:03] centers connected to a grid but I think
[46:06] that mining strategy is going to phase
[46:10] out um there's so many people doing it
[46:13] it's it's a race to the bottom it's very
[46:16] difficult to make money doing to
[46:18] reliably make money doing that we see
[46:20] lots of minor now who are pivoting to
[46:23] shitcoins or maybe AI data centers and
[46:27] they make a lot of money on on demand
[46:30] response and things like that sort of
[46:32] other things that aren't necessarily
[46:33] Bitcoin mining and I think that's
[46:36] because it's a really tough business you
[46:38] know it was it was initially easy to
[46:41] make money there and a lot of people
[46:42] noticed that and all raced in and now
[46:44] it's getting it's getting squeezed and
[46:46] so I think mining will start to get more
[46:49] creative it'll get pushed out to other
[46:51] things where you have really cheap
[46:53] energy because it's stranded energy or
[46:55] it's renewable energy it's intermittent
[46:58] like you've got some hydroelectric power
[47:00] plant somewhere that's going to give you
[47:03] free uh free Power you just have to put
[47:07] your mining machines you know connected
[47:08] to this like at the dam essentially and
[47:11] you have to deal with the fact that the
[47:13] water flow and therefore the power
[47:14] output changes all the time heat reuse
[47:17] is a huge one um the heat punks Tyler
[47:20] Stevens some of those other guys have
[47:22] been doing a lot of cool work in this
[47:24] heat reuse thing where you know a
[47:25] Bitcoin miner is a perfect base heater
[47:28] my point here is that all of those
[47:31] miners for sort of the new generation of
[47:34] Bitcoin mining they don't look like
[47:36] those machines they don't look like what
[47:38] we have now and so I think we're going
[47:40] to see is a diversification of the
[47:44] hardware to go after these different
[47:46] strategies and so there's room for new
[47:47] players to come in and uh chip away at
[47:53] bit
[47:54] M's blead uh that they're their
[47:57] essentially Monopoly on the the market
[47:59] is
[48:00] as as some of this stuff starts to open
[48:02] up we're seeing that happen now there's
[48:04] new Asic manufacturers coming on the
[48:06] scene we're starting to see new machines
[48:08] develop and I really think open source
[48:12] can accelerate that process you know
[48:15] putting this all out there means that
[48:18] now someone who's just screwing around
[48:21] in their garage on the weekend can make
[48:24] a minor right they can they can do it
[48:27] and this is how new Industries are
[48:28] created like think of all the crazy cool
[48:31] inventions that have changed the world
[48:32] that have come out of people's
[48:34] garages once we have Bitcoin mining
[48:37] companies and Bitcoin mining Hardware
[48:39] manufacturers and firmware manufacturers
[48:41] coming out of the the garage so to
[48:44] speak it's G to move fast it's GNA move
[48:47] really fast I think I think that's
[48:50] that's how this changes that's how open
[48:53] source can help and it it's going to be
[48:57] decentralizing by its very nature will
[49:00] with that also the barrier to entry to
[49:03] Bitcoin mining in general fall and and
[49:05] more individuals again coming like in
[49:09] the in the starting it was only
[49:10] individuals doing there with like their
[49:12] PCS and running the the Bitcoin notes
[49:14] and running the Bitcoin miners yeah um
[49:16] will will that Trend with that come back
[49:18] a little bit absolutely absolutely and
[49:22] I'm here for it too because I think
[49:24] that's what's really exciting again I
[49:26] don't want to to get a job at Microsoft
[49:27] just to like work on this project idea I
[49:29] have right I want to screw around with
[49:31] it like it's never been a better time to
[49:33] just get some tools and start building
[49:36] something in your home lab right like
[49:39] you can this stuff is available the
[49:41] tools that you need to work on these
[49:43] Technologies right the software world
[49:45] there's so many amazing tools available
[49:47] now you can just have chat GPT write you
[49:50] up something like people can make an
[49:52] amazing amount of progress at home if
[49:55] they have the idea of what want to
[49:57] do let's unlock that and let like a
[50:00] million new projects Bloom super
[50:03] interesting it's just like the idea of
[50:08] of just we coming back to Bitcoin mining
[50:12] being way more decentralized is
[50:14] extremely exciting for me we have the
[50:16] the full nodes it's decentralized we
[50:19] have the overall Bitcoin Network which I
[50:21] think is really resilient we have the
[50:23] social aspect of it bitcoiners uh
[50:26] defending Bitcoin on Twitter on on no on
[50:29] on all the platforms like the social
[50:32] Revolution behind it and I I think we
[50:34] have to also get to to mining uh and
[50:37] decentralize that even more we also need
[50:39] more full node Runners we also need uh
[50:42] just like yes decentralizing the whole
[50:45] thing more and more and and really build
[50:48] that crossroads movement uh that's where
[50:51] I see
[50:52] some some some bad things of like when
[50:56] we focus too much on strategic Bitcoin
[50:58] Reserve too much on ETFs and too much on
[51:01] number go up technology because if you
[51:03] just care about number go up technology
[51:06] you don't care about big access and open
[51:08] source and and and Miners and nodes
[51:11] you're just like hey the number goes up
[51:13] that that's the whole purpose of it and
[51:15] I think that's a bad thing with
[51:16] Bitcoin I I I agree I agree you know
[51:20] there's that whole meme of
[51:21] like like is this bad for Bitcoin no
[51:25] like nothing's bad for Bitcoin
[51:27] you know with number go up comes lots of
[51:29] new people into into this world uh
[51:33] hopefully some of them are you know the
[51:36] next the next uh inventors of of the the
[51:40] next best thing right like maybe a lot
[51:42] of people just want to like make a quick
[51:45] Buck or Traders or whatever but uh you
[51:48] know with that is going to come more
[51:50] Builders more awesome thinkers more
[51:52] people creating rad podcasts more people
[51:54] telling their their friends more people
[51:56] setting their Grandma up with a hardware
[51:58] wallet and a you know a Bitcoin miner
[52:01] like more people going to Shops and and
[52:05] saying like hey I W to I want to pay for
[52:07] this in Bitcoin or even probably more
[52:10] importantly is more people telling their
[52:11] employers hey I want to get paid in
[52:13] Bitcoin so with with all this stuff you
[52:18] know with number go up and like d gen
[52:21] Traders and all that stuff I think
[52:24] comes more progress and more development
[52:28] more widespread adoption which is what
[52:31] we definitely need I just I want to make
[52:33] sure that as adoption increases which
[52:37] it's going to that we
[52:40] remain you
[52:43] know remain aware of why Bitcoin is so
[52:47] special like what makes
[52:50] Bitcoin sound money what makes Bitcoin
[52:53] Freedom money and a big part of it is
[52:57] this decentralization the fact that no
[52:59] one is in control of
[53:00] it like if you know Bitcoin is money
[53:05] that is created out of thin air like a
[53:07] lot of people are like bitcoin's just
[53:10] made up money like that's not cool well
[53:13] no it is cool if it is acceptable it is
[53:17] worthwhile if there's strong
[53:19] fundamentals behind it namely that it
[53:21] can't be you know there's a supply cap
[53:23] it can't be inflated it can't be just
[53:25] created by anyone
[53:28] so that comes from decentralization the
[53:31] fact that there's these rules that are
[53:33] enforced by anyone and everyone and
[53:36] that's what makes it Freedom money so we
[53:38] need to keep that in mind as this all
[53:40] grows as people create new Services new
[53:43] products new
[53:46] anything is that Bitcoin is special
[53:49] because it's decentralized we need to
[53:51] like keep it that
[53:54] way do where do you see the future role
[53:59] of Bitcoin do you see it as as The One
[54:01] and Only Money asset World Reserve
[54:04] currency kind of a a deal or also or or
[54:09] is it more of like a parallel economy
[54:12] where where Bitcoin is existing next to
[54:14] the TR digital Financial system I don't
[54:16] really know I don't really know I'm kind
[54:18] of bad at these predictions like these
[54:20] sort of like awesome uh forward-looking
[54:24] predictions for the future I I mean know
[54:26] I would like to see it become the sort
[54:28] of unitive account for the world I think
[54:32] it has solid fundamentals and the world
[54:34] would be better off if more people Ed
[54:36] the money with solid fundamentals I I
[54:38] you know I've heard about problems with
[54:40] how often transactions can happen on
[54:43] chain you know there isn't enough block
[54:44] space for everyone's transactions so I
[54:46] think we're going to need some other
[54:49] systems along with it right that's what
[54:51] layer twoos and all that and to be
[54:53] honest I don't know what I'm talking
[54:54] about in that regard but like
[54:56] it seems like there's going to need to
[54:58] be some other things with it if uh some
[55:01] other protocols or systems that go along
[55:03] with it if those follow the Bitcoin
[55:05] fundamentals I think we'll still be in a
[55:08] good place I think this is a fair
[55:10] Assumption of like we uh the the
[55:13] important part is to keep Bitcoin
[55:15] decentralized and secure and everything
[55:17] else will develop over time we we will
[55:20] have amazing people that have amazing
[55:22] layer TOS layer frees and and it will be
[55:24] instant and great and you will be very
[55:27] quick with changing it to onchain and it
[55:29] will be inexpensive and all those things
[55:32] um but we should never ever sacrifice
[55:36] decentralization or security for that I
[55:38] think that that if we sacrifice that we
[55:41] sacrifice everything else also that
[55:43] that's what people don't get yeah I
[55:46] think that's right I think that's
[55:47] exactly right I mean it's you know
[55:52] there's Bitcoin is a hard money there's
[55:54] a lot of these sort of set in Stone
[55:56] rules about how it works but you know if
[56:01] we
[56:01] centralize on if it gets too centralized
[56:05] like those rules can be changed right
[56:06] they're just enforced by the network
[56:09] um so yeah like you said like this this
[56:12] decentralization is incredibly important
[56:15] the like Bob Bernett says the ethos of
[56:18] Bitcoin just when in doubt you can fall
[56:21] back to the ethers of Bitcoin which is
[56:24] not officially defined anywhere but I
[56:28] think we're we're all aware of what the
[56:29] Bitcoin ethos is we can we can we can go
[56:33] with that I think we'll be all
[56:35] right absolutely um one more thing that
[56:38] I'm interested in um uh how has your
[56:43] perspective on bitcoin changed over the
[56:46] years while you are in it uh do do you
[56:49] have do did you had a different feces in
[56:52] the beginning than than now or is it
[56:54] kind of the the same well when I first
[56:57] heard about Bitcoin which was a long
[56:59] time ago I think it was 20110 or
[57:04] 11 I was like why do we need another
[57:06] internet money I've got PayPal what what
[57:09] is
[57:10] this I then proceeded to get totally
[57:13] rugged and deplatformed by PayPal which
[57:15] was eye
[57:17] openening and then I was like oh and
[57:19] then it took me many years I
[57:21] unfortunately was not an early adopter
[57:23] of Bitcoin but it took me many years and
[57:26] it's so it wasn't like my my thesis was
[57:27] changing it was just kind of learning
[57:30] more about what Bitcoin is and why
[57:33] that's important uh and you know some of
[57:36] that was learning through mistakes other
[57:41] was uh other things were you know from
[57:44] listening to awesome podcasts and
[57:46] reading and learning a lot about it uh
[57:49] specifically Mining and how it works
[57:52] from like really diving in and learning
[57:54] how to implement my own
[57:57] uh
[57:58] mining uh
[58:00] system so yeah not not so much my thesis
[58:03] is changing as it is developing as I I
[58:05] learn more
[58:07] and see and hear about and experience
[58:10] more bad things from the Fiat
[58:13] system yeah it's the the Fiat system is
[58:16] is is the one that I I think that's the
[58:19] real try people say number go up
[58:21] technology is is driving us into Bitcoin
[58:24] but I think it's more of number go down
[58:27] from the Fiat system that is actually
[58:28] the main marketing driver for Bitcoin
[58:31] those guys are doing a really good job
[58:32] at advertising for Bitcoin like everyone
[58:35] who gets deplatformed or you know gets
[58:38] restrictions placed on their bank
[58:39] account or you know has to pay some fill
[58:43] out some form to like finsen or you know
[58:47] report their
[58:48] like $100 venmo purchase everyone is
[58:52] just just one more chip towards
[58:54] realizing how important Bitcoin is
[58:57] really cool um we have one question that
[59:00] I asked each and every one of my guests
[59:01] in the question is what can we learn
[59:03] from you besides
[59:05] Bitcoin oh interesting question what can
[59:09] you learn from me besides Bitcoin
[59:12] I let me think okay so you can build
[59:17] Electronics this is this is a practical
[59:19] thing I'm an engineer that's how I tend
[59:21] to think but I know them for myself and
[59:25] I've heard this from a lot
[59:26] people Electronics seems very difficult
[59:29] like it's very complicated you need to
[59:31] know extreme amounts of math and it's
[59:35] just that's for someone else to
[59:37] understand that's not true you can do it
[59:40] lots of people can do it it's not that
[59:42] hard it's easier than ever to get in
[59:45] start understanding how Electronics work
[59:47] and start building your own there's
[59:49] incredible services from PCB
[59:51] manufacturers to assemblers to tools
[59:53] that are available for cheap like
[59:55] delivered over night from Amazon it's
[59:57] it's an exciting field like lots of
[59:58] software people get into it lots of just
[60:01] hobbyists you know like Woodworkers
[60:03] people who wouldn't necessarily have an
[60:05] Electronics engineering background um
[60:08] you can you can get a lot done without
[60:10] any heavy math this is something cool
[60:12] like it's a superpower to be able to
[60:14] build your own electronic circuit and
[60:16] PCB and everything from scratch so you
[60:19] can do it there's a there's a huge
[60:21] support network um you know even bigger
[60:25] than bit coin like sort of the makers
[60:29] hackaday Make magazine things like that
[60:31] are really geared towards hobbyists
[60:34] who want to get into this field and
[60:37] start doing stuff and then you know if
[60:39] you want to if you want to level up you
[60:42] can get into bid axes or Bitcoin mining
[60:45] which is in that same field and you can
[60:48] do this uh as an example one of the
[60:50] largest bid ax manufacturers that I'm
[60:53] aware of had never soldered anything
[60:57] before making his first bit a and now he
[60:59] makes tens of thousands of them so
[61:01] that's massive yeah you can do it if you
[61:03] have the interest jump in yeah I think
[61:06] that and also you learn a lot probably
[61:08] like from like Bitcoin mining
[61:11] electronics and all all all the rest of
[61:13] it I like that uh think thinkering
[61:16] around and and and learning new stuff
[61:18] yeah yeah say [ __ ] around and find out
[61:21] right it's like what's the worst gonna
[61:23] happen you lose a few dollars you're not
[61:24] gonna you know you're not gonna you're
[61:27] not going to hurt yourself as long as
[61:28] you don't put your fingers in the outlet
[61:31] like screw around screw around and and
[61:34] build some stuff and uh you might
[61:37] just find a new hobby or a new
[61:40] career I I actually went in a school
[61:43] well and software development but um in
[61:46] that school it was uh you had to also
[61:49] learn the basics of electronics uh so
[61:52] wait maybe I can even show this way oh
[61:54] yeah show tell let's go
[61:56] this one okay I made I made myself in
[62:00] school what that looks like a power
[62:02] strip what's going on there tell me
[62:03] about yeah like I made that uh from like
[62:06] the inside of it and connecting it and
[62:08] stuff like that really yeah like I had
[62:10] to learn that like this is cool in in
[62:13] Austrian schools there's a school form
[62:16] it's called HDL okay uh and it's
[62:19] basically you get your math you get your
[62:22] physics you get all the the normal stuff
[62:24] uh but the focus on if the people get
[62:29] out of school they can actually do a job
[62:31] because if you have normal school
[62:32] without like an actual skill you best
[62:36] thing you can do is being an assistant
[62:37] or something like that or go to
[62:39] university and they focus on getting
[62:41] people ready also to to have some job so
[62:45] electri uh electrical engineer um
[62:48] software developer like something like
[62:50] that uh and I went into I think it's the
[62:54] second biggest school in in whole of of
[62:55] Austria and I did the software
[62:57] development but it's mandatory to all to
[63:00] also do the basics from all the other
[63:03] fields of engineering so I was um do
[63:07] working with metals and trying to get
[63:09] small sculptures and small like pieces
[63:12] out of there mechanics we we we did the
[63:15] basics in the in the in in the
[63:18] engineering lab and also this uh
[63:21] connecting like wires in in in the house
[63:24] and if something doesn't work you you
[63:26] can connect it we also learned uh the
[63:30] there's like 10 rules or 12 rules I
[63:32] don't maybe it's an austan thing but
[63:33] it's probably like an electrion
[63:35] electronic F field thing uh I think it
[63:39] was 10 or 12 or eight rules that you
[63:41] have to follow before doing anything
[63:43] with
[63:44] electricity like a safety kind of thing
[63:47] a safety kind of thing so I have the
[63:49] basics but
[63:51] uh just to be be cautious I I I usually
[63:55] ask my dad because he actually learned
[63:57] it but but I I like that I know the
[64:01] basics and if if there's something wrong
[64:03] in the house it's it's it's I at least I
[64:06] have an idea of things you know like uh
[64:08] and if if there's a electrical engineer
[64:12] coming to my house and fixing something
[64:14] and I talk to him I I know at least a
[64:17] little bit like I know at least a little
[64:20] bit if he's completely screwing me over
[64:22] and something like that that's always
[64:24] nice to know that is always nice to know
[64:27] I uh I get a lot of the confusion
[64:30] sometime
[64:31] between electrician an electrical
[64:34] engineer you know electrician is the
[64:36] person who does the wiring in your house
[64:39] uh and doesn't necessarily have an
[64:40] advanced degree you know there there's a
[64:42] lot of skills associated with it but uh
[64:45] the electrical engineer
[64:48] is is different right you you could be
[64:50] an electrical engineer who studies high
[64:53] voltage stuff in which case you might
[64:55] issue in for an electrician but I think
[64:57] an electrician is an expert at
[65:00] understanding uh the the codes the you
[65:04] know the safety codes about how
[65:07] electrical systems are put together
[65:10] whereas in my field there was no there
[65:12] was there's no like there is no code or
[65:15] official safety uh thing right you know
[65:19] we we learned how you can hurt yourself
[65:21] and how best not to but a lot of that
[65:23] stuff you kind of have to learn at your
[65:25] job or or if you're starting your own
[65:27] company sort of on your own but the good
[65:30] news
[65:30] is there's more access to that
[65:34] information than ever before you can
[65:36] learn incredibly fast
[65:39] online and
[65:41] uh yeah I don't know it's it's probably
[65:43] also helpful to have a dad who can tell
[65:46] you like don't don't put your fingers on
[65:48] there like that's gonna hurt so uh yeah
[65:52] and it was fun to it was fun to learn
[65:55] those things things it does more
[65:57] electrician things I think in in the end
[66:00] and uh how is it called in English Soul
[66:04] soldering uh and soing yeah yeah exactly
[66:08] I don't know I rarely talk about those
[66:11] things in
[66:12] English uh and uh it was also we had
[66:15] those those boards where we connected
[66:18] LEDs with like buttons and and like
[66:20] electricity like were you just push it
[66:22] in yeah like we just pushed the pins in
[66:25] like wide board where like
[66:27] open yeah those were really fun also to
[66:30] do in school and uh it was those things
[66:34] where I was not good at but I I really
[66:38] liked just the tinkering uh of it and
[66:41] and just trying it off like oh like I
[66:43] connect those two like oh now the LED
[66:45] actually shines up it's like oh nice
[66:48] fascinating it's cool right like you see
[66:50] that happen you're like you know like
[66:53] achievement unlocked like this is you
[66:55] can you can uh extrapolate from there
[66:57] it's like this is how the world works so
[67:00] cool I don't know I obviously was very
[67:02] into it as well absolutely really cool
[67:05] um but let's uh we have an end in the
[67:08] podcast where the previous guest is
[67:09] asking a question for the next guest
[67:11] without uh the the the the he knowing
[67:15] the next who the next gu actually is uh
[67:18] and it's a totally different question
[67:21] than than we we talk now but maybe it's
[67:24] interesting to hear what what you think
[67:25] think about that um why is Bitcoin so
[67:29] tightly correlated with with tech stocks
[67:31] and and will this ever break well I
[67:33] think tech stocks dominate the entire
[67:36] stock market so I guess we could we
[67:40] could say that the the entire stock
[67:42] market is very tightly correlated with
[67:45] tech stocks it does seem like bitcoin
[67:47] price and the stock market are pretty
[67:50] tightly
[67:51] correlated I don't know why why is why
[67:53] is that like I guess it's just people
[67:57] feel like if their Investments or maybe
[68:01] even if just the market in general is
[68:02] going up they feel more comfortable
[68:05] investing more in Bitcoin like they
[68:08] think like oh everything's good I I'm
[68:10] not going to need to just save this
[68:13] money uh for any day I think that's
[68:17] individuals maybe individuals don't
[68:19] really control the stock market uh or
[68:21] the Bitcoin price in general so maybe
[68:23] it's larger institutional investors for
[68:25] both right they think okay we can get
[68:27] into this traditionally riskier asset
[68:30] that is Bitcoin now because everything's
[68:34] doing good like it's uh and then when
[68:36] there's blood in the streets they're
[68:37] like oh that risky Bitcoin thing let's
[68:40] get rid of that and get into something
[68:42] more
[68:43] stable that's my guess I'm a I'm a
[68:46] terrible
[68:47] investor but you picked the wrong s the
[68:49] the right asset right you don't have to
[68:51] be a good investor you're just toling
[68:53] Bitcoin I I
[68:56] my like first ever Bitcoin purchase I
[68:59] think the price was like it was less
[69:00] than
[69:02] $300 and I was like oh well that this
[69:05] looks interesting maybe I should buy
[69:06] some and so I'm like well I'll I'll just
[69:09] get a half of a Bitcoin like you know I
[69:13] was like this this seems cool I'll I'll
[69:16] just like buy like a very little amount
[69:20] of it it's like not very uh uh not very
[69:25] wise investor I guess
[69:27] so I I came I I mean I came for the for
[69:31] the tech as cliche as it is I came for
[69:33] the tech I really think the Bitcoin
[69:34] technology is beautiful I'm I'm like a
[69:37] terrible investor very cautious and do
[69:40] you know the the meme I'm mean I'm in it
[69:43] for the technology meme yeah right it's
[69:47] like some sort of tech M where you don't
[69:48] actually care about it or I don't know
[69:50] what does that mean uh I will it it's
[69:54] it's very prop
[69:56] at least I I see it I mean nowadays I
[69:59] don't see it that much anymore but it's
[70:01] that guy uh with like the gold chain and
[70:04] the Bitcoin thing like I'm in it for the
[70:07] technology I I am in it for the
[70:11] technology but also number go up helps
[70:13] so I'm in it for both let's just let's
[70:17] go there yeah absolutely I I think I
[70:20] don't have any gold chains maybe I
[70:21] should get some gold
[70:23] chains yeah uh let me know like if you
[70:26] in the next podcast you come with gold
[70:28] chains uh that that would be fun yeah
[70:31] it's like one of those like uh I won't
[70:33] tell anyone but there will be signs
[70:35] right like be like oh bidx solved a
[70:38] block I wonder who it was and I show up
[70:40] with these just like solid gold
[70:43] chains that's the third the third bit X
[70:45] that sold the BL and and you with a gold
[70:48] chain it's like I don't know who it was
[70:50] I have no idea there will be
[70:53] signs really cool thank you so much uh
