[00:00] We can stop a comet from hitting the
[00:02] earth. Those things we can stop. We
[00:05] actually don't know how to turn Bitcoin
[00:06] off. It's so valuable to so many people
[00:09] that it will always exist. That
[00:12] immutability property, right? If
[00:13] everything has been optimized around us
[00:16] so that, you know, the people growing up
[00:17] today will have a faster, more
[00:19] efficient, frictionless life than let's
[00:21] say the people that grow up 100 years
[00:23] ago. But if you sit and hold it for four
[00:25] years, it's usually quite a safe bet
[00:28] where you're going to come out on top
[00:30] after a four year cycle. And so we think
[00:32] of the internet, everyone's got the
[00:33] internet. No, 64 out of 100 people on
[00:36] Earth have the internet. They know what
[00:38] Bitcoin is. Meaning like they get that
[00:40] Bitcoin is this stubborn line in the
[00:44] sand that will just keep going and they
[00:45] know what they're going to get. And
[00:47] that's actually one of the most
[00:48] appealing parts of it. There's no noise.
[00:50] There's no keeping up reading the paper
[00:53] today to see what the stock's doing
[00:55] because it went up or down or whatever.
[00:57] It's like everything's already there.
[00:58] All the news is already broken. Do you
[01:00] want to be in it or not? You can join
[01:02] and then ride the like basically just
[01:04] ride the roller coaster.
[01:08] [Music]
[01:10] Bitcoin is money on steroids. What do
[01:12] you mean by that?
[01:14] easiest way is like think about the
[01:17] internet is information on steroids like
[01:20] high throughput very fast pace it sets
[01:22] the tone like it's it keeps up with
[01:25] today right news at like you can't
[01:27] publish a newspaper today and expect any
[01:30] news to be the same tomorrow there's so
[01:32] much happening every day and so let's
[01:35] say we get you know paper letters in the
[01:37] mail and we invest in let's say a
[01:41] government bond account or something
[01:43] Now, that pace for someone that's 20
[01:45] years old that's used to getting their
[01:47] emails instantly, contacting friends
[01:49] instantly, everything is instant. Uber
[01:52] shows up at your door straight away.
[01:53] Like all this stuff is so instant. If
[01:56] you try and tell them like in America a
[01:59] savings account is like 1% interest. Oh,
[02:03] put your money into a savings account.
[02:04] $1,000 is going to get a dollar a year.
[02:07] Like that's not steroidsy enough.
[02:09] They're used to getting everything
[02:11] really quickly, really instantly, and
[02:13] really frictionlessly. And that's why I
[02:15] think Bitcoin is like Bitcoin meets
[02:18] those that criteria. It moves fast
[02:21] enough like it's got the the pace and
[02:23] the operation like as an investment
[02:25] vehicle to give returns that people
[02:28] would be like, "Oh, that's enough to to
[02:31] feel something on my time horizon."
[02:33] Because people nowadays have such a
[02:35] shorter time horizon, they can't get
[02:37] excited about putting something in when
[02:39] they're 20 years old and earning 6% on
[02:41] it for 30 years or something like that.
[02:43] They won't make the jump with that
[02:45] because it's not enticing enough. But I
[02:47] think Bitcoin is like the level of
[02:50] volatility that provides an enticing
[02:52] sort of opportunity for younger people.
[02:55] And you're you're a millennial, right?
[02:57] Or or interesting. H is it is it kind of
[03:03] it's kind of real estate of of of of
[03:05] your like I'm almost millennial. I'm a
[03:08] poor
[03:09] chie everyone thinks that I'm
[03:11] millennial. Uh but uh do you think that
[03:14] from our generation Bitcoin is kind of
[03:16] the the real estate? What was the real
[03:18] estate for boomers and and and and those
[03:20] kind of things? 100% 100%. But because a
[03:22] lot of them are priced out of the
[03:24] market, like the the way like as a
[03:26] 20-year-old trying to buy a home now,
[03:28] it's just the multiples of the average
[03:30] income is so high. Especially in
[03:33] Australia or Sydney specifically, we
[03:35] have one of the most out of proportion
[03:37] housing markets in the world right now.
[03:39] So when my parents bought a house, it
[03:42] was four times the average income. Now
[03:44] it's about 17 times the average income.
[03:47] So like the idea of like you know you
[03:49] get married and buy a home and you pay
[03:51] it off and stuff or that journey. It's
[03:54] not that it doesn't exist now. It's just
[03:56] shaped differently and it's not so much
[03:58] of like a safe path to follow like if
[04:02] you're 20 now like and you do that it's
[04:04] going to be really challenging like to
[04:06] do it out on your own 100%. Um in Sydney
[04:09] anyway because of the way that the
[04:11] market is but I think now it's like
[04:13] people can get access to stuff faster.
[04:16] So, Bitcoin, for example, you can't live
[04:18] in your bitcoins. Absolutely not. But as
[04:21] a young person trying to accumulate
[04:23] wealth, they might be able to accumulate
[04:25] wealth faster than their friends. And I
[04:27] think there's sort of a lower barrier to
[04:29] entry as an investor. You can invest
[04:32] with $1,000. Property becomes a bit
[04:34] harder if you've got $1,000. You've got
[04:37] to kind of keep saving until you got
[04:39] enough to buy or invest into a property.
[04:42] And that usually requires a big parcel
[04:43] of money. And so if I'm working at
[04:46] McDonald's or if I've got my entry-
[04:47] level job, I want to be just sort of $10
[04:50] every paycheck, $25, whatever it is,
[04:53] because every 25 bucks you put in, and
[04:55] it sounds like a Ponzi scheme, but let's
[04:57] say you put in $25 into Bitcoin, in 5
[04:59] years time, it's probably going to be
[05:01] $100 or whatever you want to call it,
[05:03] but you're going to have a meaningful
[05:05] growth on it that you go, "Oh, that was
[05:07] worth actually putting this $25 away."
[05:10] If I put $25 away a week and I say I'm
[05:12] going to earn 3% on it, I'll be like,
[05:15] "Oh man, that $25 will be worth, you
[05:17] know, $26 in 100 years," it doesn't have
[05:20] the same like meat on the bone or the
[05:22] appeal for a younger audience, I think,
[05:24] because they're just their time
[05:26] preference is they're just used to less
[05:30] delays for everything. Phone calls I
[05:33] wait less time, airplanes, less time.
[05:36] highways to get anywhere in the city.
[05:38] There's all fast transport. Like
[05:39] everything has been optimized around us.
[05:42] So that you know the people growing up
[05:43] today will have a faster, more
[05:45] efficient, frictionless life than, let's
[05:47] say, the people that grew up 100 years
[05:49] ago. So I can buy butter from the shelf
[05:51] now instead of having to make my own
[05:53] butter at home. I can download all my
[05:56] movies right now instead of having to go
[05:58] to the video store, rent a video, and
[06:01] then come home. And so all these like
[06:03] these friction these pe points of
[06:05] friction they're all getting reduced.
[06:07] And I think Bitcoin reduces sort of this
[06:12] like time horizon for people where it's
[06:14] like, oh, you can see the value of
[06:16] investing in it sort of. I mean, like
[06:19] obviously not all the time it goes down,
[06:21] but if you sit and hold it for 4 years,
[06:23] it's usually quite a safe bet where
[06:26] you're going to come out on top after a
[06:28] four-ear cycle,
[06:30] but you've got to hold it for four
[06:31] years. It's also super fun how uh you
[06:34] mentioned it because I see a lot of very
[06:37] young people like under 20 years old or
[06:40] under 25 years old uh getting less into
[06:44] Bitcoin and actually more into uh meme
[06:47] coins because they have this even more
[06:50] of like hey
[06:51] like it's so funny but Bitcoin is too
[06:54] slow like Bitcoin is not enough now.
[06:56] That's too slow because it's like people
[06:59] and that's literally a thing. So it's
[07:01] like you come from this world where you
[07:04] didn't know if you could if the stock
[07:06] would go up over 3 years or four years
[07:08] then that Bitcoin comes out and it has a
[07:10] much more strong strong arc like
[07:14] basically a trajectory that's much feels
[07:16] like a lot more predictable. And then
[07:18] now it's like when you talk to people
[07:20] like I've got friends brothers younger
[07:22] brothers that got into memecoin trading
[07:23] and they're like they're like oh yeah
[07:25] Bitcoin's so boring though. And I'm
[07:27] like, it it's got a history of 26%
[07:30] annualized returns year-over-year. Like,
[07:32] what could be boring about that? And
[07:34] they're like, "Yeah, but this does like
[07:35] a 600%." And they talk in X's. So, like
[07:39] 6x, 5x, 2x multiple, and it's like, "Oh,
[07:43] this gets 18% a year." It's like 18% a
[07:45] year. I can get 6x in like 2 days. And
[07:49] then that's where their expectations
[07:51] start, right? It's sort of like giving
[07:53] them Netflix and saying, "No, no, no.
[07:56] you don't have Netflix anymore. You've
[07:57] got to go to the video store now. They'd
[07:59] be like, "Fuck that. No way. I'm used to
[08:02] Netflix. I'm not going backwards." And
[08:04] so they're kind of their appetite or
[08:07] criteria for success basically goes up
[08:10] like gets extended. So if they make 1x
[08:13] in a day, they're going to be like, "Uh,
[08:15] it's like gambling basically. It's like
[08:17] any gambler, right? They're never going
[08:20] to feel the hit of a $10 bet if they're
[08:22] betting $1,000 because the $1,000 is
[08:25] what gives them the hit. And so as you
[08:27] keep extending your bet to get the hit,
[08:30] it's almost like you keep extending the
[08:34] volatility of the asset you're going to
[08:35] invest in just to get more gains faster.
[08:39] It sort of just gets closer and closer
[08:41] to a gamble. Basically,
[08:43] it's it's it's almost sad because uh
[08:48] when I I speak with those people, it's
[08:50] never about the fundamentals. It's never
[08:52] about uh what this thing actually does
[08:54] because if they actually research that,
[08:56] they they would see like, oh, there's
[08:58] nothing going on.
[09:00] Uh and and so Bitcoin is the only thing
[09:02] where you actually have strong
[09:04] fundamentals. It's it's it's the biggest
[09:06] and best money uh that that we will ever
[09:08] get. Uh, and then it's like, oh, but 99%
[09:12] of the world still doesn't get it. And
[09:14] that's the upside. Like, I can get early
[09:16] in because it's it's it's it's
[09:18] like get it early because a lot of
[09:21] people they're distracted or they're,
[09:25] you know, focused on meme coins and
[09:26] these things are shiny objects and like
[09:28] as people are coming into the industry,
[09:30] they're like they get kind of kind of
[09:33] ushered in the wrong direction. Do you
[09:35] know what I mean? And it's like, oh, no,
[09:37] no, no, don't look at Bitcoin. That's
[09:38] boring. Look at these things. And
[09:40] they're all these like it's like a
[09:42] circus. Literally like walking to a fun
[09:44] park, you know? There's roller coasters,
[09:46] there's rides everywhere, all this sort
[09:47] of stuff going on. It's it's mayhem. But
[09:50] I think as well it it will force the
[09:54] division between a Bitcoin like cuz
[09:57] Bitcoin has kind of got baked into it a
[10:00] lot of these sort of philosophies and
[10:02] stuff like that that transcend it,
[10:05] right? Like these behaviors. Now, a lot
[10:07] of the other meme coins, the whether
[10:10] it's Ethereum or not, it doesn't really
[10:11] matter. It's sort of they're still
[10:13] trying to figure out what they want to
[10:14] be and what they want to do. And the
[10:16] community is still trying to figure out
[10:18] what they want to be and what they want
[10:19] to do as where I think right now
[10:21] Bitcoin's feature set, one of the best
[10:23] things about it is that it's boring.
[10:26] When you have a reduced scope on
[10:28] anything, basically meaning it's like
[10:30] less exciting, it means that it can do
[10:32] that one thing really well. And I think
[10:34] that's what you want from money. Like if
[10:36] money is really important, you want to
[10:38] make sure that it can do one thing
[10:39] really well and just not break. And
[10:41] that's what Bitcoin does really well. It
[10:43] doesn't change and it doesn't break. But
[10:45] like if you look at let's say whether
[10:46] it's Ethereum or any other protocol,
[10:49] like you can't build something on
[10:51] something that's changing all the time.
[10:53] And that doesn't mean that that thing's
[10:54] bad. It just means you can't build money
[10:56] on it. Like it doesn't is it means that
[10:59] maybe you can build other stuff. Sure.
[11:01] I'm not sure. In the conversation of
[11:03] money, it's got to be consistent. We
[11:06] can't have a ledger update every sort of
[11:08] six years when a new group of people
[11:10] come in and say, "Maybe we should change
[11:13] to proof of stake from proof of work."
[11:16] Like, that's a big thing. And you can't
[11:18] have big changes like that on a
[11:22] foundation. That's like having an
[11:23] earthquake in Japan. The buildings are
[11:25] like, you know, or Bangkok more
[11:27] recently. It shakes everything above it.
[11:30] So if the decisions are being made about
[11:32] changing the chain, um it just makes the
[11:36] conversations that's the wrong energy.
[11:38] You shouldn't be trying to fix your
[11:39] chain. Your chain should be very single
[11:42] purpose and you should go and broadcast
[11:44] that purpose to everyone. And I think
[11:46] that's what Satoshi did really well. He
[11:48] put that seed in the genesis block that
[11:50] said basically summarizing all of the
[11:54] previous monies, chancellor on the brink
[11:56] of second bailout. and he's basically
[11:59] saying they're printing more money
[12:01] again. And so that's sort of like
[12:03] planting that seed in the genesis block
[12:05] is sort of saying this is the seed that
[12:08] started it all and this is where the
[12:10] problem lay. And I think it's really
[12:12] good having a very specific scope on
[12:14] anything, right? If you're trying to
[12:16] accomplish anything, you need a like a
[12:18] very specific scope or you know to
[12:21] delineate between what is in scope and
[12:23] what is out of scope. And a lot of the
[12:25] times people have too much too much
[12:28] stuff they want to do and they end up
[12:30] doing none of them really well. So you
[12:32] might have a chain that can do
[12:33] everything but it ends up not doing
[12:35] anything really spectacularly which
[12:38] means it loses out in the mind share of
[12:40] many people. Like I think Ethereum right
[12:42] now is facing one of these sort of you
[12:45] know I think Ethereum as an ecosystem
[12:47] and stuff it's just different to Bitcoin
[12:49] right or wrong it's a different
[12:51] conversation right and it's like I think
[12:53] for them it's sort of you know now
[12:55] they're in a really rock and a hard
[12:57] place basically as a as a like community
[13:00] they're in a rock and a hard place where
[13:02] they aren't the fastest chain they're
[13:06] not the hardest money and so they kind
[13:08] of they're not a salana which is faster
[13:11] They're not Bitcoin, which is a heart of
[13:12] money, and they're not the most secure.
[13:14] And now they're kind of left, you know,
[13:17] where you're kind of a jack of all
[13:18] trades, master of none. Um, and that can
[13:21] be really challenging. But I think
[13:22] that's actually one of the biggest keys
[13:25] for Bitcoin's success is that it it's
[13:28] not trying to do everything. It's trying
[13:30] to just be deflationary and stay that
[13:33] course without any human being tampering
[13:36] with it or fixing it. You know what I
[13:39] mean? And I think it's a really
[13:40] interesting challenge like can we not
[13:42] break it? Can we not ruin it? Like you
[13:45] know we tend to ruin good things very
[13:48] quickly. So we hope we're I hope that we
[13:51] don't. And I think that the community in
[13:53] Bitcoin, some people call them toxic and
[13:55] stuff like that, but I don't think it's
[13:58] toxic. I think it's just preserving
[14:00] tradition and thinking about these
[14:01] people that are ultra ultra um
[14:05] enthusiastic about preserving tradition.
[14:08] um you know they might not be elegant
[14:10] with their words but whatever it's a big
[14:13] topic so we are very very protecting
[14:18] about Bitcoin we really don't like
[14:20] anyone else to uh [ __ ] with Bitcoin to
[14:25] manipulate Bitcoin or or try to make
[14:27] something fancy out of Bitcoin. So uh
[14:30] the the toxic side has it ups and downs.
[14:33] Uh obviously um if someone comes on
[14:35] Bitcoin Twitter uh and he gets fro and
[14:39] he plays with ideas and and is like oh
[14:41] like what about that what about that and
[14:43] he just tries to learn and a bunch of
[14:45] people say like oh have fun staying poor
[14:47] you don't get it I'm not sure if that's
[14:49] counterproductive
[14:51] counterproductive educate don't
[14:53] humiliate like if there's ever a chance
[14:55] just always share like knowledge don't
[14:57] rub it in their face don't say they're
[15:00] an idiot for not buying it when they
[15:01] should have That's just
[15:03] counterproductive. At the end of the
[15:04] day, we're all on the same planet and we
[15:06] should all be trying to help each other
[15:08] out of bad situations if we can see that
[15:10] it's a bad situation. So, yeah, everyone
[15:13] everyone comes around eventually, but I
[15:15] think it's never productive. Other than
[15:16] people getting, you know, getting
[15:18] patting themselves on their back for
[15:21] feeling better about themselves, I don't
[15:23] think it's a net gain to be like, "Oh,
[15:25] have fun staying poor." It's like, dude,
[15:27] they're probably very distracted because
[15:29] their boss is chewing them out at work
[15:30] and their kids yelling or their parents
[15:33] are sick or some like so many people
[15:35] have so much stuff going on that it's
[15:37] very, it's not that they don't want to
[15:39] have an easier life or they don't want
[15:41] an easier money. It's just there's heaps
[15:43] of stuff, you know, on top of our plates
[15:45] every day like in and out. It feels like
[15:49] Yeah. That's an ego thing almost like
[15:51] you you want to make your feel yourself
[15:53] feel better and saying like oh you don't
[15:55] get you you don't get it. Uh versus uh
[15:59] you actually try to educate but but it's
[16:02] also it's also exhausting. Yes. Exactly.
[16:06] So I get that it is exhausting.
[16:09] Absolutely. Um re really really really
[16:12] interesting. maybe a fun thing to do um
[16:15] for the young audience for for the
[16:17] gambling audience that is like, "Oh,
[16:19] Bitcoin is is boring. I I don't like to
[16:22] do that." What is your most bullish
[16:25] thesis on on on Bitcoin? Okay,
[16:28] so
[16:30] I Okay, so the way that I put it
[16:33] is we don't like and this is not a this
[16:37] isn't even hyperbole or like a metaphor.
[16:40] We can literally stop a nuclear warhead
[16:42] from ruining a city. We can stop a comet
[16:46] from hitting the earth. Those things we
[16:49] can stop. We actually don't know how to
[16:51] turn Bitcoin off. And just like if you
[16:54] think about a machine that we've created
[16:56] in humanity that you turn it on and we
[16:58] can't actually turn it off because
[17:00] there's no way to with Bitcoin. And I
[17:02] don't mean like, you know, it's not
[17:04] centralized. I mean like it's so
[17:07] valuable to so many people that it will
[17:09] always exist like as in someone will
[17:12] make it run and that is sort of that
[17:16] immutability property right if you can
[17:18] only invest in one thing I'd probably
[17:20] invest in the thing that we don't know
[17:23] how to turn off because it's going to
[17:25] keep going and so like if survival of
[17:27] the fittest I think that's a pretty
[17:30] compelling story and it's like just
[17:32] alone if I could invest in something
[17:34] that would never break and I get
[17:36] royalties if it's successful. That's
[17:39] like being able to invent to invest in
[17:41] the invention of the wheel and saying,
[17:43] "Hey, if anyone ever uses a wheel in the
[17:46] future, you're going to benefit from
[17:48] that." Same thing with like the
[17:50] internet. Hey, there's 21 million coins
[17:52] on this thing called the internet. Would
[17:54] you want to invest in it? 100%. You're
[17:56] owning the base layer of everything
[17:59] else. But my my oneliner would be we
[18:02] cannot break it. So, if we can't break
[18:05] it and it's going to be around forever,
[18:07] then that's probably a great place to
[18:09] put money. It might not be the best, you
[18:11] know, whatever. But at right now, if I
[18:14] can't break something, then that's going
[18:15] to be by default the best place I could
[18:17] ever put my money because it can't
[18:19] break. And so, that just conceptually to
[18:22] me is like feels like quite a
[18:24] no-brainer. Um, and then someone goes,
[18:26] "But you can put your money anywhere."
[18:28] It's like, "No, no, no. My money melts
[18:30] when I put it anywhere else." Like
[18:32] literally, if I put an ice cube in front
[18:34] of you and it melted and you said, "No,
[18:36] just put your money on this other pl."
[18:38] It's like, "No, no, the ice cube keeps
[18:39] melting. The temperature in the room
[18:41] hasn't changed. It's going to keep
[18:43] melting. No matter how many ice like ice
[18:45] cubes you put there, they will keep
[18:46] melting." So, in the same way with
[18:48] Bitcoin, kind of the same thing. It's
[18:50] like it's going to keep melting if it's
[18:53] not in a deflationary environment, which
[18:56] is like a cool temperature. Think about
[18:58] like the ice cube putting it in a
[19:00] fridge. If it's in a fridge, it'll stay
[19:02] as an ice cube. If you put it in a
[19:03] sauna, it's going to start looking way
[19:06] different. Um, yeah, it just feels feels
[19:10] so like someone said, "It's too good.
[19:14] It's too good to be false, not too good
[19:16] to be true." And when I heard that, I
[19:18] was like, "Oh, that's so true." Um,
[19:21] yeah. I I love that. It's good too good
[19:24] to be false. Never heard that before.
[19:27] Canut Canut fun home. So that's his
[19:30] infinity divided by 21 million and too
[19:33] good to be false. I I I love that. It's
[19:36] really good. Yeah, it's it's kind of and
[19:38] uh you brought it so good uh because uh
[19:42] it it it will be around. We cannot turn
[19:44] it off and uh it's it's it's like one
[19:47] way either we it's breaking and we turn
[19:49] it off or everyone will use it somehow
[19:52] in in in the as a base layer. the same
[19:54] way as electricity, the same way as
[19:56] gunpowder, the same way as the internet.
[19:59] Uh if if you show up with the one gun in
[20:02] a in a fist fight, you have all the
[20:03] advantage. If you show up uh financially
[20:06] with with Bitcoin in your pocket versus
[20:08] five other people have US dollar,
[20:10] Australian dollar, like euros, you will
[20:12] win. Like there's like no no questions
[20:16] around that. Yeah. Survival of the
[20:19] fittest. And it feels sort of like a
[20:21] Titanic thing, like when you're trying
[20:23] to run from the boat that's
[20:25] sinking. It's what it can feel like. Oh,
[20:28] look, markets can change and stuff like
[20:30] that, but jeez, not much is going to
[20:33] change if you keep printing money. It
[20:35] can't it can't change. You can put as
[20:38] many band-aids on it as you want, but
[20:40] it's going to be so difficult to change.
[20:42] And the more you print, the easier it is
[20:45] to print more. You know, it's like a
[20:47] it's like when you've had a million
[20:48] beers and you take the piss, you take a
[20:50] piss the first time and you break the
[20:52] seal and then you have to keep going to
[20:54] the bathroom after more beers. Like just
[20:56] it gets faster and faster. Anyway,
[20:58] that's basically what printing money is
[21:00] like. That's they're doing the same
[21:01] thing. They print. Well, that was pretty
[21:04] easy.
[21:05] They hold their name a finger down on
[21:07] the printer again and they just keep
[21:09] doing it because it's I mean if they can
[21:11] if you can do it I mean if I was a
[21:14] politician and I could do it and it was
[21:16] like part of the package then sure but
[21:19] like that's just you know you're
[21:21] literally just taking money out of the
[21:23] pockets of the taxpayers who you're
[21:25] supposed to work for which is super
[21:27] weird like if you you know if you steal
[21:30] from your boss like you should probably
[21:32] not be
[21:33] there and right now They're all
[21:35] employees stealing from their boss and
[21:37] the taxpayers are their boss. So I I
[21:39] don't get it. Uh I'm not a politician,
[21:41] but to me that makes no sense. So okay,
[21:45] but that that's a pretty good incentive
[21:47] to look at a different system where my
[21:49] boss isn't stealing from me or you know
[21:51] you don't the team's not stealing from
[21:54] you. So um there there isn't even a
[21:57] boss. There's just a rules and this like
[22:00] that's a way better system where where
[22:01] there's not even someone that could
[22:03] steal from you. No, no, it's actually
[22:06] saying, "No, all I want you to do is
[22:08] keep all your money the same as it is."
[22:11] It's like, "No, no, I'm not trying to
[22:13] change anything." It's like, "Oh, great.
[22:15] Well, that's good." Yeah. Absolutely.
[22:18] Really interesting. Uh, and I think um a
[22:20] lot of people have uh especially outside
[22:23] of Bitcoin. I think within Bitcoin, more
[22:25] and more people understand how early we
[22:27] actually are. But outside of Bitcoin,
[22:30] they they don't get how early we are
[22:33] because they have seen it now since a
[22:35] few years. Uh and they have seen it
[22:37] maybe at like 5,000, maybe at 10,000 and
[22:39] they're like, "Oh, like what is it at
[22:41] 100,000 now?" Like now it's over like
[22:44] how high can it go? Uh and they just
[22:46] look at the one unit price. They don't
[22:48] look at like network adoption. they
[22:50] don't look at like what's the what's the
[22:52] total total thing for Bitcoin. So, uh
[22:55] I'm I'm always frustrated in in making
[22:57] people aware of we are just barely
[23:01] getting started here. Like it's nothing.
[23:04] It really is. It's not like it's not a
[23:08] novelty, it's a migration. Do you know
[23:10] what I mean? Like it's not like oh it's
[23:12] hit 100 grand or oh it's hit a million
[23:15] dollars. Oh cool, it got there. It's
[23:17] like, no, no, no. It's all flooding into
[23:20] this. It's not stopping at a million.
[23:22] It's not stopping at two million. It's
[23:24] not stopping at 10 million. It's just
[23:26] going to keep going. Just like the
[23:28] internet, right? The internet started,
[23:30] all the big brands made websites. That
[23:33] didn't mean the internet was done. The
[23:35] internet had all these new products to
[23:37] bring out. So, basically, let's think
[23:39] about the internet, right? 1990s,
[23:41] everyone's got magazines, reading
[23:42] magazines. Then New York Times and all
[23:45] these companies that produce magazines
[23:47] or media content, they make websites and
[23:50] we go, "Ah, everyone's got a website.
[23:52] Now the internet's good." That's sort of
[23:54] like saying, "Ah, Bitcoin's at $100,000.
[23:56] Okay, now it works." Not really. It's
[23:59] like the internet got made, everyone
[24:00] made a website, and then you had
[24:02] Napstar, Google, Instagram, Facebook,
[24:06] and it's totally reformed the entire
[24:09] world based on how the internet grew.
[24:12] And it hasn't stopped growing either.
[24:14] And you know what's a crazy stat? The
[24:16] whole world, like the global population
[24:18] for internet like usage and like
[24:20] actually having access to the internet
[24:22] right now, I don't think it's any higher
[24:25] than like 63 or
[24:27] 64%. And so we think of the internet,
[24:30] everyone's got the internet. No, 64 out
[24:33] of 100 people on Earth have the
[24:34] internet. So the internet, even though
[24:37] it's changed so dramatically and changed
[24:39] our world so dramatically, it's just
[24:41] over halfway adoption and it's most
[24:44] likely that the biggest gains to be made
[24:46] are from the people that have never
[24:48] touched it yet. Do you know what I mean?
[24:50] Like they're the freshest original minds
[24:52] that are sort of unpoisoned by the
[24:54] internet. And so when I think about
[24:56] Bitcoin, when people are like, "Oh,
[24:57] how's the Bitcoin thing going?" It's
[25:00] like it's migrating like money and
[25:03] capital is just migrating just like
[25:06] information migrated from libraries to
[25:08] the internet. Capital is going to
[25:10] migrate from the traditional market
[25:12] systems into basically into a stable
[25:15] money system or like let's say a hard
[25:17] money system. Um and that's out of
[25:19] desperation like literally out of zero
[25:22] alternatives. Like if the system was
[25:24] good and worked people wouldn't people
[25:27] would just use it. Like you risk when
[25:29] you when you re like if you have a
[25:32] product, let's say currency is a product
[25:33] and I'm a country. Let's say I I could
[25:36] be a company selling t-shirts or I could
[25:38] be a country offering currency. If my
[25:41] product is not good, I'm going to make
[25:43] way for a competitor to solve the pain
[25:46] points that my money is not solving.
[25:48] Right? Like let's say I made t-shirts,
[25:50] but I only made short arm t-shirts.
[25:53] People in Norway might want long sleeve
[25:55] t-shirts because it's cooler. I've
[25:57] missed out on a whole thing. And so I
[25:59] think like when people are looking at,
[26:01] you know, this like sort of this art
[26:03] like it's almost like they've got the
[26:05] old goggles on. Oh, it's at 100K. Oh,
[26:08] cool. No, no, no, no. You don't
[26:10] understand. This is like flipping the
[26:12] whole world upside down. It doesn't stop
[26:14] at 100K. It stops when it's all when
[26:16] when every cent is basically on this new
[26:19] system. So, we're sort of migrating the
[26:22] same way we migrated all our information
[26:24] into digital information.
[26:26] um all of our capital is going to be
[26:28] migrated into cryptographic capital
[26:31] basically which is hardened and secured
[26:33] by cryptography digitally and energy.
[26:38] That's an amazing insight uh and this is
[26:41] always the way to understand how bitcoin
[26:45] is actually going to get adopted because
[26:47] we have seen it with electricity with
[26:50] the internet. There's still a lot of
[26:52] places on the earth where there's no
[26:54] electricity. H if you turn on off the
[26:57] electricity in like New York City for
[27:00] two weeks, you have big problems in
[27:02] other cities, in other areas, it's
[27:05] completely normal to not have
[27:06] electricity. Same with the internet and
[27:08] the same will be true for Bitcoin. We
[27:10] have different areas where uh internet
[27:13] will uh where Bitcoin will spread faster
[27:16] and more deeply. those will be way more
[27:19] prosperous and the other ones will will
[27:21] be left behind. A city without
[27:23] electricity, internet and Bitcoin looks
[27:26] a lot sadder than a city with
[27:28] electricity, internet and Bitcoin. Yeah.
[27:31] And like so like just thinking about
[27:32] this, right? You know, different like
[27:36] Bitcoin is like or value, let's say
[27:39] value is like what's valuable. Value is
[27:41] in the eye of the beholder like beauty
[27:43] is in the eye of the beholder. You might
[27:45] really think that tall blonde girls are
[27:49] your favorite like type of girl or
[27:51] whatever. And it's like no, everyone
[27:53] might think that redheads or brunettes
[27:56] or whatever it is. Everyone's got a
[27:57] different perspective on what's
[27:59] valuable, right? So for people, think
[28:01] about Bitcoin came out in 2008 or
[28:04] whatever. People have been using Bitcoin
[28:06] in like in foreign countries where
[28:09] inflation's really high. They use it to
[28:11] store value. Now, we hadn't learned
[28:13] about that in America or Australia
[28:15] because we didn't feel like our
[28:17] inflation was like Zimbabwe dollars,
[28:19] right? Where it goes up a million% a
[28:21] year. And so, if you're in Argentina and
[28:24] you're going, you've got 75% a year
[28:26] inflation and you put your money in
[28:29] Bitcoin, to you, that's like getting a
[28:31] savings account with 75% annual
[28:33] interest, like just because you're
[28:35] dodging that loss. And so those
[28:38] countries, Argentina,
[28:40] Venezuela, all these countries, they had
[28:42] a big when people throw them Bitcoin,
[28:45] they weren't like, "Oh, but you know, is
[28:47] it better than Venmo?" Or, "Oh, I can
[28:50] already transfer money using my bank
[28:52] account." They're like, "Dude, [ __ ] your
[28:54] bank account. [ __ ] that. I'm losing 70%
[28:57] every year by my government. Like, how
[28:59] can I avoid that?" Oh, there's this
[29:01] thing you can park your money in, and it
[29:04] doesn't actually print more. it goes
[29:06] down in deflation. What? You don't need
[29:08] to tell them twice. You don't even need
[29:10] to argue with them. There's no, "Oh, but
[29:12] what about Salana?" Ask all those people
[29:16] about these about the tokconomics of
[29:18] other protocols and they'll go, "It's
[29:19] all junk." Because they've lived and
[29:21] breathed what inflation feels like from
[29:24] an external source controlling how the
[29:26] monetary like how your money supply
[29:28] basically operates. So, you know, I used
[29:31] to operate an exchange and we got to
[29:33] work with lots of different countries,
[29:34] Brazil, Argentina, all this sort of
[29:36] stuff. And you actually get to see the
[29:38] pain points a lot more meaningfully in
[29:40] these different regions than say, you
[29:43] know, just serving US customers or
[29:45] Australia or UK, like that's a pretty
[29:48] vanilla profile of people that are very
[29:51] well connected to financial systems and
[29:53] stuff. But when you expand to like let's
[29:55] say Africa or South America or Latin
[29:58] America, you start opening up the
[30:00] conversation for actual real pain
[30:02] points. You know, now you know you you
[30:04] go talk to some of your friends, you've
[30:06] got to basically convince them why
[30:08] Bitcoin is a good thing. But if you you
[30:10] and your friends are in Zimbabwe, you
[30:13] guys are all huddling around figuring
[30:15] out how you can all get more Bitcoin.
[30:17] you know because you know what the pain
[30:19] point is but until we can see the pain
[30:22] point it's very hard to get to move the
[30:25] needle until the pain point is felt here
[30:27] even with Sailor right Sailor was
[30:29] looking like how do I stop my company's
[30:32] money from melting he's literally that
[30:34] was his problem that he had to solve and
[30:36] he's like well I've looked everywhere
[30:38] I've dug up I've turned over every rock
[30:40] and I can't see anything else that looks
[30:43] as appealing as Bitcoin and I think
[30:45] that's because he had a problem that he
[30:47] needed to solve. And that sort of comes
[30:48] back to that idea that people say that
[30:51] everyone finds Bitcoin when they need it
[30:53] or, you know, everyone gets Bitcoin at
[30:55] the price they deserve, whatever it is.
[30:57] But people do find Bitcoin when they
[30:59] need it most because it's usually got
[31:01] some sort of solution to their problem.
[31:03] Like anything, right? I didn't buy an
[31:05] iPhone when it first came out. I didn't
[31:07] buy one for like 2 years or 3 years, but
[31:09] after a while, I was like, "Oh, there's
[31:12] this game I really want to play with my
[31:13] mates online. Okay, cool. now I'll get
[31:15] an iPhone because that's got this game
[31:17] or whatever. Like everyone's got their
[31:19] own carrot to get into something. That's
[31:21] why it's like I find it really hard to
[31:24] insult people about not getting into it
[31:26] because everyone's lives different.
[31:28] Everyone's pain points are different
[31:29] that they're trying to figure out in
[31:31] their life. So I think
[31:34] uh it's one thing I do think is it's a
[31:37] it's good that foreign country like uh
[31:40] let's say countries that aren't the
[31:42] western world got exposure to Bitcoin
[31:45] really early on. So there's really great
[31:47] companies in Latin America, South
[31:49] America, Africa that are doing really
[31:51] good stuff for awareness and
[31:53] distribution because as Bitcoin gets
[31:56] like the Western world grabs a hold of
[31:58] it, it might start being putting the
[32:01] velocity on Bitcoin's price to acquire
[32:03] it too aggressive. Do you know what I
[32:06] mean by that? Like where it's like West
[32:07] the West is like excited about Bitcoin.
[32:09] So you're seeing JP Morgan and all these
[32:11] guys pumping the price, but what that
[32:13] can do is start alienating the people
[32:15] that need it most. Now, I'm not saying
[32:17] keep the price small. That's not the
[32:20] point. The point is that you sort of
[32:22] want to walk harmonically if you can uh
[32:26] together uh as much as as much as
[32:28] possible, but it's just not going to
[32:29] happen. But um they have they've had
[32:34] really good infrastructure and typically
[32:35] these places have really good payment
[32:37] infrastructure.
[32:39] um as well. So yeah, like I mean Kenya
[32:43] Kenya's had Empaca where they were
[32:45] trading mobile minutes. They were
[32:46] trading mobile minutes because it was so
[32:48] much more efficient and it solved the
[32:49] pain point for them. So instead of
[32:51] giving buying things for do like Kenyon
[32:54] Yeah. Kenyon peso or whatever it is
[32:56] their currency, I'd actually just trade
[32:58] you mobile minutes, cell phone minutes
[33:00] because that was the currency we all
[33:01] use. So it's like, you know, everyone
[33:04] figures it out, right? And I think
[33:06] Bitcoin finds a way of entering
[33:08] everyone's conversation pretty quickly.
[33:10] Um, even like even people that aren't on
[33:13] like aren't Bitcoin supporters, let's
[33:15] say a lot of the teams in Ethereum
[33:17] raised ICOs, right? Like they do their
[33:19] initial coin
[33:21] offerings, heaps of them have heaps of
[33:23] it parked in Bitcoin because it's their
[33:26] store of value as well. Like they've got
[33:28] Ethereum that they raised, sure, but
[33:30] they've also migrated a lot of that into
[33:32] Bitcoin because of its certainty,
[33:34] because of it how deterministic it is,
[33:37] because of how secure it is. Like, and
[33:39] when you think about security, right, if
[33:42] this is the thing, money, right? If
[33:44] this, oh yeah, it's money. This isn't a
[33:45] calendar app. This isn't like, oh, Uber
[33:48] Eats, wait, I can get a hamburger to my
[33:50] door in 15 minutes. No, no, this is
[33:52] money. Money has killed millions of
[33:55] people. It's ruined billions of people's
[33:57] lives. Like this is like the final d
[34:01] kind of thing, right? You really want it
[34:03] to not [ __ ] up. So there's no room for
[34:06] experimentation. We're building the
[34:07] rocket as we're flying it across the
[34:09] water. And it's like I think when you
[34:12] look at the level of experimentation
[34:15] that people put to it or think that it's
[34:18] is necessary, I think those people need
[34:21] to zoom out a bit more beyond their own
[34:23] scope of reference. And it's like, "Oh,
[34:26] no, no, no. Bitcoin needs to be faster
[34:28] and it needs to have monkey JPEGs and
[34:31] stuff." It's like, "Dude, calm down."
[34:33] Like, you know, you don't know what it
[34:35] needs to be yet. Let's just get everyone
[34:37] in the room before we start saying what
[34:39] it needs to be. And it's very rich that
[34:43] most of the people saying what it needs
[34:45] to be, they're doing that almost out of
[34:48] boredom. Like, it's like there's no more
[34:50] opportunities, so we need to do
[34:51] something more. It's like sure there's
[34:53] some upgrades and stuff but nothing that
[34:56] is pressing enough so much that it needs
[34:59] to happen now or tomorrow unless it's
[35:01] like something let's say a security
[35:03] vulnerability. Um you you look at
[35:05] quantum computing and things like that
[35:07] but that's actually not the biggest
[35:08] security vulnerability. The biggest
[35:10] security vulnerability is always going
[35:12] to be social, right? What if people
[35:14] change it? Like block size wars is a
[35:16] great example in 2017. What happens if
[35:20] they let the block size change? Now it
[35:22] doesn't matter whether it's two
[35:23] megabytes, three megabytes or one and a
[35:25] half megabytes. The point is the rules
[35:28] changed and they the rules were
[35:30] overthrown. And that is more the point.
[35:33] And so when Ethereum says, you know,
[35:35] let's say they changed their protocol
[35:37] rules, it's not so much, oh, you chose
[35:40] the wrong block size or oh, you made it
[35:43] too far. That's not the point. The point
[35:45] is that there is some way that that can
[35:48] be it's fragile enough where it can be
[35:51] broken. Like do you know what I mean?
[35:53] Where it's like oh we don't have enough
[35:54] people in the community to have enough
[35:56] conviction on the original message so
[35:59] let's tweak it as we go. You got to
[36:01] remember if these things are going to be
[36:02] here for 20 50 100 years we can't tweak
[36:06] anything. It's not our responsibility
[36:08] right? We're meant to respect what the
[36:11] code is and make sure it basically is
[36:14] preserved in its best fashion. That's
[36:17] why we don't put Pepsi signs on the
[36:19] pyramids. We didn't build them. The
[36:21] pyramids aren't ours. We're not putting
[36:23] ads and [ __ ] all over them. Like, we
[36:25] respect the heritage of them. We have
[36:27] national parks that we preserve. We have
[36:29] statues that we preserve. We take care
[36:32] of things that are very valuable. And if
[36:35] all bodies of work and Bitcoin is a
[36:37] pretty close thing to a body of work, um
[36:41] when you look at how much energy we've
[36:42] put into it as a like as a species
[36:45] really like we're pouring energy into
[36:47] the security of this um you know so
[36:50] there's the physical security with all
[36:51] the energy in the Bitcoin mining but
[36:53] just as important this is like the top
[36:55] back to the toxic maximalists right on
[36:58] Twitter. They're exhausting when people
[37:00] go, "Oh, why don't like, you know, Elon
[37:02] Musk said, "Oh, Bitcoin's kind of good,
[37:05] but it needs faster blocks." And then
[37:07] everyone's like, "Boo." And like even
[37:10] he's not like even he's not safe from
[37:13] them, right? But they're not sort of
[37:15] saying that because they don't like Elon
[37:16] Musk. Maybe, maybe not. A lot of the
[37:19] times they're just trying to make sure
[37:20] that this doesn't [ __ ] up and people
[37:22] don't get their like, you know, their
[37:24] greasy sort of hands on it to get it to
[37:27] be something that they want it to be as
[37:30] opposed to something that it should and
[37:32] could be. So, it's sort of the, you
[37:35] know, personal people sort of injecting
[37:37] their own personal preferences in there
[37:39] everywhere, which look, it's great, but
[37:42] this isn't we're not asking for
[37:43] feedback. Like this isn't a project
[37:45] that's asking for feedback, I don't
[37:47] think. I'm like I don't hear the founder
[37:49] talking very much. That's for sure. So
[37:52] I'm not really in the I'm not in the
[37:53] market to give feedback if it's not
[37:55] being asked
[37:57] for. I'm more like, okay, I see your
[38:00] vision. I'm aligned with your vision.
[38:02] How can I share your vision? I'm not
[38:04] trying to make more work for the founder
[38:06] like by making his thing into something
[38:08] different that they didn't intend it to
[38:10] be. Um, yeah, I just want to sort of
[38:12] share the word and if it's not for you,
[38:14] then you don't talk about it. But if if
[38:16] it is for you and you think it can bring
[38:18] value to other people's lives, then you
[38:19] want to talk about it. Let's take a
[38:21] break for a moment and appreciate the
[38:24] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[38:27] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[38:29] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[38:32] of showing that you are a true
[38:35] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[38:38] dropped a completely new and amazing
[38:40] Genesis edition of their watch
[38:43] collections. You have the date of the
[38:45] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[38:48] and of course also the block height and
[38:51] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[38:54] the level of detail they put in in this
[38:57] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[38:59] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[39:02] down in the descriptions. I love those
[39:05] watches. so so much. And now if you have
[39:08] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[39:11] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[39:13] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[39:15] to deal with that. The first way is you
[39:17] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[39:19] entry for you to get into the
[39:22] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[39:25] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[39:28] super simple and secure way. And if you
[39:31] check out the link in the description,
[39:33] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[39:36] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[39:39] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[39:42] partner in terms of how to get the most
[39:45] out of your sovereignty. They will
[39:47] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[39:50] that is perfect for your individual
[39:53] situation. They will show you how you
[39:55] can secure your own devices. Securing
[39:58] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[40:00] have to keep all your devices secure.
[40:03] One topic that is overlooked often is
[40:05] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[40:08] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[40:11] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[40:13] place already? And last but not least,
[40:15] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[40:17] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[40:20] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[40:25] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[40:28] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[40:30] be for the first time ever speaking at
[40:33] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[40:36] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[40:38] really looking forward to seeing all of
[40:40] you there. You can get your ticket in
[40:43] the link down in the description of
[40:45] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[40:47] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[40:51] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[40:53] there. Yeah. Yeah. And you can always uh
[40:56] how do we say you can always fork off.
[41:00] You you can always say like, "Oh, I I I
[41:02] copy the code. I change what I want and
[41:04] here is the new coin. That's way better
[41:06] than Bitcoin. Please buy it. You will
[41:08] see that nobody cares about your coin."
[41:10] Yeah. Very quickly. And and like and
[41:12] it's an interesting thing about, you
[41:15] know, when we're talking about like
[41:16] changing the rules of the protocol.
[41:19] So, one of the things is like it's you
[41:22] you never want it to change once because
[41:24] once it changes once, it can change a
[41:28] second time much easier. And I think
[41:30] about this, think about a glass window
[41:33] and like let's say a shark movie, right?
[41:36] You're in an aquarium. There's a big
[41:38] glass window, the shark, and the shark
[41:39] gets angry and it swims into the glass
[41:42] window. You see that in shark scary
[41:43] movies or whatever, right? And it
[41:44] smashes it and a tiny crack goes
[41:48] like through the glass window. The next
[41:50] time they hit it, the glass the strength
[41:53] of the glass is much less. Right? So
[41:55] once you smashed a glass like given it
[41:57] the shatter its structural integrity is
[41:59] basically compromised. The same thing
[42:01] with a protocol. If you can change the
[42:05] block size or whatever the structural
[42:07] integrity of the decision making is
[42:10] broken. And that's why we saw as soon as
[42:12] the block size changed they forked off
[42:15] and changed block size. But because the
[42:18] people that were willing to change block
[42:20] size, their decision-making structural
[42:22] integrity is lower. So what happened?
[42:24] They forked off and then very quickly
[42:26] after it forked again because they were
[42:28] infighting again. So it's this
[42:30] indecision or let's say lack of focus or
[42:34] lack of alignment that
[42:37] usually like produces these problems.
[42:40] It's not so much like a hacker that's
[42:42] broken something or something. It's
[42:43] always these my my opinion versus your
[42:46] opinion kind of thing. And that's where
[42:48] you see if people are willing to have
[42:51] these flippant opinions, that flippant
[42:54] opinion will follow itself to the new
[42:56] chain, you know. So, if we all decided
[42:59] to change block size, then we're all the
[43:01] type of people that decide things should
[43:04] change. And that then becomes part of
[43:06] the DNA of our chain. And sure enough,
[43:09] the people that decide to fork off from
[43:11] Bitcoin ended up having a fork war
[43:13] themselves very shortly after. And so,
[43:16] yeah, I just think there's something to
[43:18] be said about that. Like, there's it's
[43:20] very overlooked, but you know, in
[43:22] computer science and all that sort of
[43:24] stuff, the number one attack vector is
[43:26] always social engineering. So if you
[43:28] wanted to bring Bitcoin down, you would
[43:31] find a way to get consensus on making
[43:34] the blocks bigger and more worse or
[43:37] whatever, making nodes bigger and more
[43:40] expensive to run, you'd probably find a
[43:42] way to justify increasing the the supply
[43:45] cap of how many bitcoins are in there.
[43:48] But all these things, like you change
[43:49] any of them and you ruin the party. Do
[43:52] you know what I mean? That is the
[43:53] attack. The attack is ruining the party.
[43:56] It's not, oh, everyone that held Bitcoin
[43:59] got hacked. It's, no, no, no. The beast
[44:02] lost. It's, you know, it was vulnerable
[44:04] and it got, you know, over two years of,
[44:07] you know, sneaky malicious changes,
[44:10] someone figured out a way to convince
[44:12] everyone that we needed to double the
[44:14] coin supply to 42 million. And that
[44:16] becomes like that becomes ridiculous.
[44:19] It's like saying I don't even know what
[44:21] it's like saying, but it's just like
[44:22] it's not our product to change. It's,
[44:24] you know, our product to use if we like
[44:26] it and not use if we don't like it.
[44:30] That's how I think about it. It it's
[44:32] it's so cool uh how you break it down
[44:35] with the class. Uh because that's
[44:38] something I think that gets overlooked
[44:40] that when Bitcoin Cash fork there was
[44:41] Bitcoin Satoshi edition and other things
[44:44] that came from that
[44:47] the people
[44:48] that try to change it. Those are people
[44:51] that are not satisfied and they want to
[44:54] change it again. They want to change it
[44:56] again. And Bitcoin is kind of the class
[44:58] that cannot be broken. Uh it's like you
[45:01] you cannot get through there. And and
[45:03] for me honestly the block size war
[45:07] showed for me that Bitcoin can resist an
[45:10] inside social attack. It was an inside
[45:13] social attack. It was not something I I
[45:16] don't know may maybe it was outside but
[45:17] it was not something uh planned from the
[45:20] CIA or like the the China government is
[45:23] going in there. It was just an inside
[45:26] social manufactured. It was an organic
[45:28] quarrel and a disbelie. Yes. And that
[45:31] that was I 100% agree, Robin. That was
[45:35] the biggest aha moment in the world for
[45:37] me. I was like, "Oh my god, it handled
[45:40] it. Holy moly, that's like the biggest
[45:43] test ever because if it survived that,
[45:46] which was brutal, then I mean cuz you
[45:50] had so many of the thought leaders
[45:53] internally that were torn apart, like
[45:55] torn from which way to go." And so it's
[45:58] like if it survives through that then
[46:00] it's no like there's no there's no other
[46:02] figurehead that's going to be able to
[46:03] come in and tear it apart as as well. I
[46:06] don't think so. It's an interesting
[46:08] lesson though. I think it like many I
[46:10] think you and I similar to many other
[46:12] people that is
[46:14] like you know that's like watching some
[46:17] person get into a fight and win and
[46:19] being like oh okay I'm never I'm not no
[46:23] he's my dude. I'm betting on that person
[46:25] every time from now on. Nobody has ever
[46:28] done that to anyone or whatever, you
[46:29] know. I've never seen something so
[46:31] resilient. Um yeah, at least that's how
[46:34] I think about it. Yeah, it's also
[46:36] interesting the whole whole story um
[46:39] with with the people and the thought
[46:40] leaders as you mentioned like I think
[46:42] Roger V is probably the face of of of
[46:44] the whole thing and there are many
[46:46] others from that. He suffered
[46:48] financially massively from it and his
[46:50] image and probably way more important
[46:52] his image uh suffered a lot. Uh and uh
[46:55] this is this is something where I'm like
[46:58] okay you you you have to be first honest
[47:01] with yourself and you can mistake you
[47:04] can make mistakes maybe you actually
[47:05] fought but then also admitting I'm like
[47:07] oh I should I was wrong like it's
[47:09] actually better to keep like and and and
[47:11] to to see those personal uh stories uh
[47:15] is super fascinating. I personally just
[47:17] went into Bitcoin 2020. So I had the I
[47:21] had the good thing that I just listened
[47:23] to the history of of Bitcoin and read
[47:26] the books around it. And I think it was
[47:28] a hard time to be in. I don't know if
[47:31] you were around in in in that time, but
[47:33] what I read was like Reddit was super
[47:36] for the the bigger blocks, the whole
[47:38] industry, all the miners. It was not an
[47:40] easy time to be a Bitcoin. No. Okay. So
[47:43] Okay. So I'll give you an example,
[47:44] right? So at the time I was CEO of Wire
[47:47] and we were a large infrastructure
[47:49] provider for liquidity and security to
[47:51] many of the exchanges and and basically
[47:54] wallets as a service, liquidity as a
[47:56] service, all that stuff, right? And we
[48:00] had investors that were, you know,
[48:03] openly supportive of the block size
[48:05] change and stuff like that. And they
[48:08] emailed me saying, "Oh, what are you
[48:10] guys going to do? Are you guys for or
[48:13] against it?" And I was like, I thought
[48:16] it was a bit out of my pay grade. Like
[48:18] I'm the CEO of the company, but I'm not
[48:19] the most knowledgeable on the protocol.
[48:21] Like, and we've got gurus at the company
[48:23] that are they're more in tune with it.
[48:26] Like I was still startup mode, like
[48:27] founder. Oh, this is fun. This is
[48:29] exciting. But these guys know what
[48:31] Bitcoin means beyond just startup land.
[48:34] And so I showed them the email and I
[48:36] said, "Guys, what's our stance on this?
[48:37] Because I'm going to follow whatever you
[48:39] guys think because you're the most
[48:40] informed." And then basically they said,
[48:43] "No, we're not doing it." Like you we we
[48:45] don't want why I should not be
[48:46] supporting it and here's why. And so I
[48:50] got them to basically write the email
[48:51] back from my account to send to our
[48:54] investors about why we're not
[48:55] participating. And out of all the
[48:58] companies that signed what was called
[48:59] the SegWit 2X, the New York agreement,
[49:02] it was basically this uh this agreement
[49:04] to sort of make this hybrid thing. Um
[49:07] our company was one of the three that
[49:09] didn't sign. So, we were not we're
[49:11] opposed uh against the block size
[49:14] changing. Um, and that showed me
[49:17] something, too, because I realized that
[49:20] it doesn't matter if Coinbase and all
[49:23] these other big companies at the time
[49:24] are for it. They might have 40 million
[49:27] users, but they still have one node, and
[49:30] the one node is what votes. Does that
[49:32] make sense? Like, it doesn't matter how
[49:34] influential you are. It's like, oh well,
[49:35] if all your users have nodes, then they
[49:38] will vote against this or for it or
[49:41] whatever. But because no one is actually
[49:44] a user, they don't have any weight other
[49:48] than sort of not propaganda, but
[49:50] promotional material, right? Like
[49:52] saying, "Hey, we're for this and we're
[49:53] for that, and here's why we think this
[49:56] is a really good idea." But the reality
[49:58] was it was just the market just said,
[50:01] "No, no." Like, "Thank you. Oh, you're
[50:04] you're worth a hundred million hundred
[50:05] billion dollar company. You know, this
[50:08] $10 billion company, you need it. Oh, we
[50:10] need faster blocks. We need bigger
[50:12] blocks. We can't do Too bad. Find
[50:15] somewhere else to go. And like that in
[50:18] itself, seeing it being able to
[50:20] withstand that, I'm like, "Oh my gosh,
[50:23] this is unbelievable." It makes you
[50:25] realize that it's like its own entity.
[50:28] Like, it really is where everyone is
[50:31] sort of protecting it. Like it's like
[50:33] it's like a first alien baby that we
[50:36] found on Earth and we're all making sure
[50:38] that it doesn't get harmed. Does that
[50:40] make sense? Like that's how it feels. um
[50:44] just preserving it as much as we can
[50:47] because you know tiny changes over time
[50:49] add up like you know like um it's just
[50:54] like like slang language becomes
[50:56] colloquial language like the word
[50:58] naughty right like I don't know if this
[51:00] is real or not but from what the origins
[51:02] of the word was from when you had kids
[51:05] that
[51:05] were basically around like early late
[51:08] 1800s or something and the kids had had
[51:11] nothing and they go around the rich
[51:12] area, the rich people around the train
[51:14] stations or whatever, and they would be
[51:16] considered the have- knots, the naughty
[51:18] kids, and they were usually more like
[51:21] adventurous and playful and always doing
[51:24] stuff. And so they were considered the
[51:25] have knots or the naughties. And that's
[51:27] where the word naughty came from. And
[51:30] it's like we don't know that, but at the
[51:32] time that would have been maybe quite
[51:33] common. I don't know. But that was a
[51:36] relic of the past that we just take for
[51:38] granted today. So when you have these
[51:41] tiny tweaks in history, they add up very
[51:45] like in a huge way over time. And so if
[51:48] Bitcoin is this canvas that's meant to
[51:50] last for 20, 30, 40, 50 years, then we
[51:53] want to make sure it looks good for the
[51:55] people that come like, you know, in 20
[51:57] years, 30 years time, if they look at us
[51:59] and be like, "Look at these idiots. They
[52:01] blew it." like they had the best chance
[52:04] at sound money in a high inflation
[52:06] environment or whatever it is cuz the
[52:08] future's looking at us now seeing how
[52:10] we're playing our cards against the
[52:12] reality like we don't know it but like
[52:14] you know back in you know back you know
[52:17] past days people have probably been part
[52:19] of stuff that you know that we look back
[52:21] in history and go how did people know
[52:24] like not object to that at the time or
[52:26] whatever and it's like well they just
[52:28] didn't know at the time we're probably
[52:30] under the same spell where people are
[52:32] like, "So what? These politicians just
[52:35] printed money whenever they want and
[52:37] people just kept paying taxes." It's
[52:39] like, "Yeah, pretty much." It's like,
[52:41] "Okay, well, that's your own fault then.
[52:43] You guys are too stupid. You're going to
[52:44] keep playing that game." And it's almost
[52:46] like that where history would say, "No,
[52:49] no, we're not we're not having a cry for
[52:51] you. You guys were suckers and you
[52:52] didn't stand up for yourself or you
[52:54] didn't you didn't move when you could
[52:56] have moved or you didn't take action."
[52:58] But I think history will reward the the
[53:01] action being taken in general. Um but
[53:04] yeah, so we want to make sure that the
[53:06] chain because there's no we don't know
[53:09] what people 20 years from now need from
[53:11] the chain but we know they need it to
[53:13] not break. Like that's one feature that
[53:16] the people in 20 years need that we need
[53:18] today that people tomorrow need that
[53:20] people yesterday needed it not breaking
[53:23] being reliable. So whether it can put
[53:26] monkey pictures on it or not, that maybe
[53:28] is a thing for us today or us yesterday
[53:30] or us in 2 years from now, but it's not
[53:32] relevant for 50 or 100 years. Like, do
[53:35] you know what I mean? It's not it's not
[53:38] as core and critical. And so when we get
[53:40] to choose what features we keep or what
[53:42] features we master in, if we want to
[53:45] have something for 50 to 100 years, then
[53:47] let's pick security, which is what it
[53:49] masters in. Security. It's the most
[53:51] secure piece of machinery we've ever
[53:53] built. And so it's like well that's a
[53:55] great feature to have because security
[53:57] is reliability and reliability means I
[54:00] can build stuff on top of it. Whether it
[54:02] is when I say build stuff I don't mean
[54:05] building DeFi apps. I mean building
[54:08] financial systems that can rely on
[54:11] Bitcoin as a unit of account because it
[54:13] won't change. It's predictable. And if
[54:16] you've got a system that changes every 6
[54:19] months or 3 years when the community
[54:23] gets restless in a bare market, so they
[54:25] find something to argue over and they
[54:27] start trying to argue over changes like
[54:30] you can't build a future on that and
[54:33] companies that are worth trillions of
[54:34] dollars or billions of dollars or
[54:36] whatever can't rely on that. And so I
[54:38] think security and persistence and uh
[54:43] consistency like you've got two levers
[54:45] in life. Predictability when that's
[54:47] really high up, risk is really low. So
[54:50] if something's very predictable, the
[54:51] risk is low. Now if something's very
[54:53] risky, then the predictability of it is
[54:55] very low. And so with Bitcoin, if you
[54:58] know what you're going to get and you
[55:00] know what's always going to be there,
[55:02] then that predictability can make you
[55:04] plan for 5 or 10 years ahead. That's a
[55:07] really powerful thing. We can't really
[55:08] do that today. Like in a fiat system or
[55:11] high inflation environment, it makes
[55:13] planning 10 or 15 years of your life
[55:15] very challenging. You're like, "Oh,
[55:17] let's plan. Well, let's say 22 years
[55:20] old. Let's start and I've got my partner
[55:22] and I'm married. Let's start saving for
[55:24] a house." Okay, cool. So, we start
[55:26] saving, but the treadmill is getting
[55:28] faster as we're trying to save. Oh, if
[55:31] we put away $10, you know, $100 every
[55:33] week for the next six years, we'll be
[55:36] able to buy X. But if we put like if
[55:39] $100 doesn't equal $100 in so many
[55:43] years, we've got to put more and more
[55:45] every year just to keep up with this
[55:47] goal, but we won't be able to keep up
[55:49] with the goal because our disposable
[55:51] income is not growing by 14% or 12% or
[55:54] whatever the inflation rate is. And so I
[55:56] don't know, I just think by having one
[55:59] of the things that I hear the most from
[56:00] young people that are in Bitcoin is that
[56:02] they they don't know enough about other
[56:05] stuff, but they know that Bitcoin they
[56:08] know what Bitcoin is. Meaning like they
[56:10] get that Bitcoin is this stubborn line
[56:14] in the sand that will just keep going
[56:16] and they know what they're going to get.
[56:17] And that's actually one of the most
[56:18] appealing parts of it. There's no noise.
[56:21] There's no keeping up reading the paper
[56:24] today to see what the stock's doing
[56:25] because it went up or down or whatever.
[56:27] It's like everything's already there.
[56:29] All the news is already broken. Do you
[56:31] want to be in it or not? You can join
[56:33] and then ride the like basically just
[56:35] ride the roller coaster. Um, but I do
[56:39] think I do think it's important that
[56:41] everyone learns about it just as an
[56:44] alternative financial system because
[56:46] it's always good learning about, you
[56:48] know, well, what other languages do
[56:50] people speak on planet Earth and how
[56:52] were those languages formed? Are they
[56:53] the same structure as my language? But
[56:56] because Bitcoin is just a language, it's
[56:57] a financial language. And so you know
[57:00] your because money is so critical to all
[57:02] of our lives day in and day out. It's
[57:05] like when you know if you have Bitcoin
[57:09] it can change basically so many other
[57:11] attributes around your life for better
[57:13] and worse. Obviously you know you might
[57:15] find yourself waking up with a kidney
[57:17] missing and you know a ransom letter for
[57:19] you. That's obviously not good because
[57:21] people are getting these wrench attacks
[57:22] and stuff like that. Um, but then on the
[57:25] alternative is maybe it gives you a lot
[57:27] of peace of mind. Maybe you have less
[57:30] money, but you're more certain of the
[57:32] money that you do have. And I think
[57:35] that's an interesting thing because
[57:36] we've never had to question whether our
[57:38] money was sort of real or not. But
[57:41] that's that's also a um it's also like a
[57:47] that's like the curse of the curse of uh
[57:51] let's say western society being popular
[57:54] being very money focused. One of the
[57:56] curses is we're so used to this money
[57:59] like we're not used to what good money
[58:01] is and our behavior of spending and
[58:04] wanting more and needing things and all
[58:06] that stuff that doesn't work on a good
[58:08] money stand or a hard money standard
[58:10] basically because I don't want to sell
[58:13] the stuff that I I don't want to keep
[58:14] buying stuff that's not valuable when
[58:17] I've realized how valuable something can
[58:20] be. So with Bitcoin like you know you
[58:22] buy oh cool my phone that's mad. Oh,
[58:24] I've got this new glass. That's mad. But
[58:27] it's not valuable. Like this stuff isn't
[58:30] valuable really. It adds value sort of,
[58:32] but it's not really valuable. But you
[58:35] know, like your bitcoins, you can feel
[58:38] this like very strong piece of value
[58:41] that's not going to be something you're
[58:42] going to be bored of in one year or two
[58:44] years. Like I always think about Bitcoin
[58:47] never takes tourists. If you have
[58:50] learned about Bitcoin and studied it,
[58:52] you you never come you never buy it and
[58:56] then sort of sell it 3 years later and
[58:58] be like, "Oh, yeah, that was good." Like
[59:00] you buy it, you learn about it, and then
[59:02] you learn about it some more. And as you
[59:04] learn more about this, it teaches you
[59:06] more about what where you're where
[59:08] you've come from. Sort of like the more
[59:10] you learn about Bitcoin, the more you
[59:11] understand the old financial system. At
[59:14] least that's been my experience. I found
[59:16] like I've seen my eye like I feel like
[59:20] it's reading like you know learning
[59:22] about Austrian economics. What's that?
[59:25] Oh, it basically says like don't spend
[59:28] more than you earn like you know like
[59:31] kind of like being very everything feels
[59:33] like it's coming back to common sense
[59:36] not financial gymnastics.
[59:39] Um yeah that's another thing as well. I
[59:43] think Bitcoin is the product that people
[59:44] need. Like if there's a financial
[59:46] instrument, it's not the 20x leverage
[59:49] debt equity reverse government bond
[59:52] mortgage back security thing. All of
[59:55] these things are noise. It's like you
[59:58] need the simplest thing that gives you
[60:00] peace of mind. Like money is not meant
[60:02] to be an adventure. It's not meant to be
[60:04] a life sentence. It's meant to be
[60:06] something we figure out and then we can
[60:07] enjoy ourselves or find what our purpose
[60:10] is or find what ways that we can add
[60:13] value beyond just sort of um you know
[60:15] something financial. I think I think who
[60:18] knows but we'll find out.
[60:22] It's a there was a lot in there.
[60:26] Sorry mate. But but it it is really
[60:29] interesting and and there are multiple
[60:32] things that that I kind of remember but
[60:35] uh I want to get to something that's
[60:39] that's maybe interesting to talk with
[60:41] you about. Um what do you think is the
[60:44] barriers that Bitcoin that Bitcoin just
[60:46] has to overcome still? like like a lot
[60:50] of people come to me like, "Oh, Bitcoin
[60:51] is so great and it's like so awesome and
[60:53] and then like once you get Bitcoin, you
[60:57] see the value proposition all of the
[60:59] sudden every other asset seems so bad."
[61:03] Uh and then you wonder like why aren't
[61:06] we already at like 10 million? Why
[61:08] aren't we at 50% adoption rate? Like
[61:12] what what is holding us back? What are
[61:15] the barriers uh that that Bitcoin has to
[61:18] overcome that we come to 10 20 30%
[61:22] adoption rates?
[61:24] Yeah, I mean I agree with you. I think
[61:26] of Bitcoin's like med the Medusa asset.
[61:30] Once you look at it, every other asset
[61:32] just looks like a rock. Do you know what
[61:34] I mean? Like literally it's like
[61:36] everything's turned to stone once you've
[61:38] looked at it and you like can't unsee
[61:39] it. But I actually think one of the
[61:42] biggest the biggest hurdles is
[61:46] misinformation. Just straight up
[61:49] uninformed opinions flooded everywhere.
[61:52] And there's not critiques. Critiques and
[61:55] tearowns and stuff like you know someone
[61:57] critiquing something. Absolutely welcome
[61:59] the critiques but just literally
[62:03] uninformed opinions. Like if you're a
[62:05] financial YouTuber, so many of them are
[62:07] like, "Oh, Bitcoin's me." It's like
[62:10] you've done one hour like you maybe have
[62:13] done one hour of study. And that's why
[62:15] Bitcoin rewards people that have done
[62:18] cerebral work, not physical work. And
[62:22] it's almost like people feel like
[62:24] Bitcoin's a cheat code because they
[62:26] haven't had to put a shovel in the
[62:27] ground and their back's not sore from a
[62:29] hard day's work. It's like, no, but
[62:32] you've been wearing, you know, you've
[62:34] been reading and reading and reading.
[62:35] Your brain has been studying. your
[62:37] critical thinking has been challenged a
[62:39] billion times. Um yeah, I just think the
[62:43] misinformation is oh it's so
[62:47] unreasonable. Like I just think it's
[62:49] really unfair. Nobody likes inflation.
[62:52] There's not one person who likes giving
[62:53] away their money for free. I don't I
[62:55] don't think like to to strangers. I
[62:58] don't think like it's on our
[63:01] responsibility to make sure we have
[63:02] informed we informed and helped everyone
[63:05] understand it. But yeah, there's a lot
[63:08] of uh financial irrespon financially
[63:11] irresponsible
[63:12] uh influences I think that sort of
[63:15] they're misleading people unfairly.
[63:17] Absolutely. This is that's that's why I
[63:20] always say come in education. When you
[63:23] want to do something for Bitcoin, um use
[63:26] your voice to speak for Bitcoin in
[63:29] whatever form feels most natural for
[63:31] you. Like if if you write a blog, if you
[63:34] want to write articles, do that. If you
[63:37] want to make Tik Tok videos for 30
[63:39] seconds, that we need definitely a lot
[63:42] more. Uh if you want to start a podcast,
[63:44] if you want to start in Twitter, like
[63:45] whatever. Yeah, like you can do it an
[63:48] anonymous. You don't have to show your
[63:49] face. But yeah, educating people on
[63:53] Bitcoin or even um I had people reaching
[63:56] out and saying like, "Oh, I I I want to
[63:58] be on a podcast." and I had them on on
[64:00] the podcast, but they never been
[64:02] anywhere online,
[64:04] but they have been offline everywhere.
[64:07] They're doing small presentations in
[64:10] front of like 50 people in their local
[64:12] town. They're going from bar to bar and
[64:14] they're doing actually the hard work of
[64:16] like offline. And I was like, okay,
[64:18] let's try just door knockocking almost,
[64:21] you know, literally. Have you heard
[64:23] about the good word from Satoshi? Like,
[64:26] you know, it's like almost like you're
[64:27] selling Bibles. Oh, yeah. It's like,
[64:30] hey, like I have to sell something
[64:33] literally.
[64:35] But we need those people that do online,
[64:38] offline, wherever the people are like
[64:41] educate other Bitcoin, other people on
[64:44] Bitcoin. That that's the most important
[64:47] thing because misinformation is is the
[64:49] noise is big. It's huge. It's wild. But
[64:52] I think
[64:53] actually there's like a group a cohort
[64:57] of people I think that are growing up
[64:59] now. Whether you're let's say age 15 to
[65:03] 30, you're they're going to get split
[65:06] into two factions. People are going to
[65:08] either go memecoin trading because
[65:10] everyone's trying to make money and
[65:13] they're trying to make money because
[65:14] everything's getting really expensive.
[65:15] So there's sort of like the people that
[65:17] are like, you know what, I'm just going
[65:18] to grind it out. I'm gonna keep putting
[65:20] my paycheck into Bitcoin or a portion of
[65:22] it. And then you're going to see the
[65:24] people that are going to go into meme
[65:25] coins and just almost like gambling
[65:27] their wages every week and hoping that
[65:29] one of them works out. They're most of
[65:32] them in general though they will get
[65:35] Bitcoin as like they will see Bitcoin
[65:38] for what it is because they're grow like
[65:39] if you're 15 to 30 now you're growing up
[65:42] seeing all these lies from like Trump
[65:45] getting impeached and then not getting
[65:47] impeached and Biden and all this stuff.
[65:51] The the cat's more out of the bag with
[65:53] them. like for us like you know over the
[65:56] past 12 years basically I've never
[65:58] really thought anything o of politics
[66:01] other than yeah it's like whatever like
[66:03] okay whatever they're saying is probably
[66:05] right but like since Trump and all that
[66:07] stuff it's like it's fully opened the
[66:10] door for like everything just not
[66:13] feeling like everyone's on their side
[66:15] like they really lost the audience over
[66:17] the past eight years I'd say do you know
[66:20] what I mean like and since it really
[66:22] felt like Trump has been the where he's
[66:24] like, "No, that's fake news." And it's
[66:26] like, "Oh, dude, you can't call it fake
[66:28] news." And it's like, "Dude was right.
[66:32] It is all bullshit." And that is all
[66:34] [ __ ] And that's all [ __ ] And
[66:36] so there's a co like there's a group of
[66:38] people that are very like very easily
[66:40] influenced who are growing up. That is
[66:42] what they're learning. Oh, it's all
[66:45] [ __ ] And so those people, they will
[66:48] get Bitcoin faster than the 31-year-old
[66:51] that's worked at Goldman Sachs for 4 and
[66:53] a half years and studied economics for
[66:55] three years. he's like they're too far
[66:58] gone almost like and I say that
[67:02] um their conditioning like their whole
[67:06] identity and career would be built
[67:08] around this conditioning right like
[67:09] let's say if I was at Goldman Sachs I'd
[67:11] be like yeah dude no that's just this
[67:13] thing like whatever but no they've got
[67:16] no clue about actual economics cuz I
[67:18] studied it or whatever it's like no
[67:20] worries dude maybe not but that system
[67:22] you're studying was all [ __ ] there
[67:24] was not a real economist in the room
[67:26] like and that's where it goes, oh well
[67:28] that's what real economics looks like an
[67:31] open free market where you you you know
[67:34] you're chucking the things into the into
[67:36] the pit and watching what comes out. Um,
[67:39] so I think a lot of people have seen
[67:42] like, you know, they've got Joe Rogan
[67:44] podcast, a podcast as a medium, right?
[67:47] Like this, it's a much more direct
[67:49] channel for people to see unfiltered
[67:51] perspectives or unfiltered thoughts. And
[67:53] so there's a, you know, this whole
[67:54] generation growing up with Joe Rogan is
[67:56] their news anchor, right? Like I love
[67:59] his [ __ ] It's mad. Like you listen to
[68:00] it, you're like, "Oh, wow. That's
[68:02] interesting. I didn't even know that
[68:03] existed." But it's more outside the
[68:06] narrative because the certain news
[68:07] channels will just keep showing the 8 10
[68:10] you know things that they're meant to
[68:12] show. If it was if we converted every
[68:14] news channel like traditional media
[68:17] channel into a YouTube channel or like
[68:19] translated it, it would be like a
[68:21] YouTuber that keeps telling you all
[68:23] these products that are really good and
[68:26] never disclosing that they've been paid
[68:28] to tell you how good they are. And so
[68:30] obviously the YouTuber loses the
[68:32] audience really quickly when he goes,
[68:34] "Oh guys, I've got I drink this every
[68:36] morning." Like if Joe Rogan says, "Oh
[68:38] man, I have this every single morning."
[68:39] You go, "Oh man, you go and you find Joe
[68:41] Rogan doesn't have it every morning. He
[68:43] thinks it tastes like shit." You'd be
[68:45] like, "Dude, [ __ ] you." Like you say,
[68:48] "That's bullshit." Like, and I reckon
[68:50] there'd be a lot of people that would be
[68:51] like, "No, I thought you had like
[68:53] integrity or whatever." And that's what
[68:55] that's why though they're they're so
[68:57] popular now because there is integrity.
[69:00] It's real. It's authentic. Is where the
[69:02] news isn't. And so this generation of
[69:05] people that have seen that transition,
[69:07] they saw us go from, oh, the news is
[69:09] [ __ ] and heaps of these, you know,
[69:12] stories are [ __ ] that are just kind
[69:14] of like being pedled for an agenda. Many
[69:17] people see that and they go, oh no, I
[69:19] don't like that. Like that's why we saw
[69:21] Trump win because so many people were
[69:22] like, "What the hell? This is all so
[69:25] cooked." Like, "No way. You've been
[69:27] trying to jail him for no reason and
[69:28] you've been doing all this bad stuff and
[69:30] da da da." So people were just like, you
[69:33] know, they they get it now. And so now I
[69:36] think there's a whole lot of people that
[69:37] will understand alternative, let's call
[69:40] it alternative economics, uh much faster
[69:43] than traditional economics.
[69:46] That that's awesome. And and I think
[69:48] also Trump won the election because he
[69:50] went on all the podcast like he went on
[69:53] Eden Ross, Joe Rogan and so many more
[69:57] like he was on almost every podcast that
[69:59] I listen to outside of Bitcoin. And how
[70:02] fantastic though and what a low bar.
[70:05] Hey, you're leading the whole world into
[70:07] the future. Can you talk to us for 3
[70:10] hours unscripted? Like that's all he has
[70:13] to do. And everyone goes, "Holy [ __ ]
[70:16] he's a human being. He's normal. He
[70:18] might not have every perfect answer, but
[70:20] that's part of it, right? No one's
[70:21] trying to catch him out. Like, look, his
[70:25] competitors are probably trying to catch
[70:26] him out with a gotcha, right? But the
[70:30] audience, like the people voting for him
[70:32] or the whole world, they just want to
[70:33] hear what he has to say because they're
[70:35] like, "No, no, we'll figure out who's
[70:37] right or who's wrong. We just want to
[70:39] hear them." And so, obviously, like when
[70:41] Camala Harris was going to go on Joe
[70:42] Rogan's podcast, it was like, "Oh, it's
[70:45] got to be in our studio." and these are
[70:47] the questions and it's the same thing.
[70:49] It's all manufactured. It's not real.
[70:52] And so I think real is now in vogue or
[70:56] authenticity and Bitcoin's a pretty
[70:58] authentic money. And I so I think that
[71:02] that need for authenticity and sort of
[71:05] lack of confusion and stuff like that is
[71:08] like a it's like a hangover from the
[71:11] fiat system, I think. And I think that's
[71:13] sort of changed now. So kids growing up,
[71:16] like the kids in kindergarten, when they
[71:18] grow up, Bitcoin will be, you know,
[71:21] wild. Like it's going to be crazy to
[71:22] think, and I don't mean like the price
[71:24] is going to be really high. I just mean
[71:26] like it's going to be far bigger than it
[71:30] is now in terms of how much everyone
[71:33] understands it, how much people have
[71:35] access to it, how dependent on it are
[71:37] we, you know, what what is Bitcoin doing
[71:41] um on
[71:42] an outside of money perspective, outside
[71:46] of uh financial perspective? Uh how do
[71:50] you see that side? Well, I think it's I
[71:53] massively right. So firstly, it can't
[71:56] like it doesn't change. It it's very
[71:59] stubborn, right? If it Bitcoin had a
[72:00] personality, like if it was a creature,
[72:03] we'd say it's a very stubborn creature
[72:05] because it doesn't change. It's not, you
[72:08] know, adjusting course based on when
[72:11] people talk to it. It really is doing
[72:13] its own thing and you can get on board
[72:16] or not. And that attitude, I think
[72:18] there's a couple of things. One, it's
[72:21] disciplined. So every 10 minutes new
[72:24] block every 10 like it doesn't take a
[72:26] day off or anything like that. So it
[72:27] exudes this discipline that I think
[72:30] discipline in our world today is a
[72:32] modern day superpower when everything is
[72:34] trying to distract you being disciplined
[72:36] and being focused is the superpower. So
[72:40] when people say you know for Bitcoin I
[72:43] actually think that's one of the really
[72:44] good things is that it is boring so to
[72:47] speak. People go oh this is Bitcoin's so
[72:49] boring. I think that is good because we
[72:52] don't want we want something to be
[72:55] focused and goal orientated and you
[72:57] can't be goal orientated if there's 30
[72:59] goals. There's got to be one goal or one
[73:01] focus, right? Very very narrow uh scope.
[73:06] Um I think that discipline like because
[73:09] money is so deep in our uh dayto-day
[73:12] needs or our life like survival stack.
[73:16] um when you change the money to be a
[73:18] different type of money, it changes the
[73:21] way you become. So let's say people with
[73:23] Bitcoin compare their Bitcoin wallet
[73:25] transaction list and the frequency of it
[73:28] with their let's say their online
[73:31] banking. Online banking, yeah, you're
[73:33] buying this, you're buying that.
[73:34] Bitcoins you don't move unless
[73:36] absolutely necessary. Like you're never
[73:39] just like throwing them around. You
[73:41] might have some that you throw around,
[73:42] but in general, they're the last asset
[73:45] you want to move. You'd rather sell
[73:47] anything else before them. And so, I
[73:49] think for me, I think Bitcoin's
[73:52] definitely showed me like that you can
[73:56] survive in this world being focused and
[73:58] disciplined. Like, you can get away with
[74:01] not having to be you can be insulated
[74:03] from the noise and Bitcoin feels like
[74:06] that. And so I think those behaviors
[74:08] start reflecting back in yourself where
[74:10] you're like, "Well, maybe I should be
[74:12] more disciplined. Maybe I should be more
[74:14] focused." And like you see the community
[74:16] in Bitcoin, they're promoting good
[74:19] things. They promote healthy lifestyles.
[74:22] Like not that I adopted, but I mean like
[74:24] they promote eating really good food and
[74:27] being educated on like critical thinking
[74:30] or vaccines and stuff. Like I've never
[74:32] seen an industry where there's so many
[74:34] smart cats around and anything because
[74:36] they're all it's not it's all their
[74:39] thinking. They think differently. Like
[74:41] do you know there's critical there's
[74:43] actually thinking going on because to be
[74:46] excited about Bitcoin you've got to
[74:48] think about it to like you know what I
[74:50] mean? Like you got to kind of see it for
[74:52] what it is. And so I think heaps of
[74:54] people have had huge life turnarounds
[74:57] with Bitcoin. Um people have gotten
[74:59] fitter, healthier. Um people have gotten
[75:03] you know change like increase their
[75:05] knowledge in different areas. Um with
[75:08] Bitcoin it's almost reli like a religion
[75:11] because religion is like a framework for
[75:13] how to live right in the same way
[75:15] Bitcoin's a protocol for how it can
[75:17] operate. And so when you have a
[75:19] community of people that all have the
[75:21] same money, you have like this is said
[75:24] by Australian Bitcoiner um Whiz, he's a
[75:27] brilliant guy and he's saying how
[75:29] everyone comes into the community,
[75:30] everyone's like 80% the same. Like oh
[75:33] yeah, sound money this and that. But
[75:35] then there's these 20% edges where it's
[75:37] like, "Oh, I like sound money and rock
[75:40] climbing or I like sound money and
[75:42] numbers or I like sound money and this."
[75:45] And it's these edges where everyone's
[75:46] little craft or passion kind of gets to
[75:50] cross-pollinate with other people's
[75:52] passions. And I found like I found like
[75:53] just from a community perspective, it's
[75:56] been incredible. like great artists,
[75:59] great sculptors, like just from all
[76:02] different kind of backgrounds, you know,
[76:04] like that's
[76:06] pretty that's like organic multicultural
[76:09] like do you know what I mean? It's not
[76:10] like a forced multicultural. It's like a
[76:13] organic just seeing the rise of
[76:15] different markets and how it responds.
[76:17] You know, Kenya likes it for this
[76:19] reason. Iran likes it for that reason.
[76:22] The UK likes it for this reason. Aussies
[76:24] like it for some reason. And there's all
[76:26] these different ways people show that
[76:28] they like it. Some people build video
[76:30] games, some people write papers, some
[76:32] people make innovations. I don't know.
[76:33] But it's it's just so influential. The
[76:37] one thing it will do
[76:38] is because it reduces complexity, it
[76:42] will give you more peace. So there's
[76:45] less variables out of your control. So
[76:48] you'll have a lot more peace because
[76:50] you're not like, "Oh, is the money going
[76:51] to go down? What's the housing market
[76:53] going to do this year? my f oh what's
[76:56] that stock going to do this quarter oh
[76:58] don't like everything's very nowish but
[77:01] if you can find a way to put like a
[77:03] target on the future and know with like
[77:06] a a reasonable level of confidence that
[77:08] it's going to be the same when you get
[77:10] there now you can start planning it's
[77:12] very hard to plan in a really high
[77:14] inflation environment I mean I don't I
[77:16] don't know so I don't know how to plan
[77:18] in something like that because whatever
[77:19] you're planning for you know it's going
[77:22] to change in 3 days or change in 5 days
[77:24] or 10 days. So, it's a wild journey and
[77:28] we're all on it, but it's mad. It's
[77:30] exciting. And if you're questioning like
[77:31] whether or not to jump in for anyone
[77:34] listening,
[77:35] 100,000% you will not regret it. And the
[77:38] entire community as well, they can
[77:41] answer every question you've got and
[77:42] they're happy to. Some of them are, not
[77:45] all of
[77:46] them. Just pick the right
[77:49] one. But yeah.
[77:51] It's uh it's the most welcoming
[77:54] community I have ever been. Everyone is
[77:57] helping you and even
[78:00] really big guys are answering your DMs
[78:04] and like, "Oh, like of course I can help
[78:05] you out with that." So, I'm fascinating
[78:09] how kind and uh open the community is on
[78:15] every level. On every level. It's wild.
[78:19] It's wild. It just feels like and I
[78:22] don't know if that's how life is
[78:24] supposed to be or it just feels so
[78:27] special because the alternative was so
[78:30] not like that. Do you know what I mean?
[78:31] like every person if you ever needed
[78:33] anything it's like yeah make an
[78:36] appointment and you know pay me money
[78:38] and you know like it was always like
[78:40] there was always something else to it is
[78:42] where this people have kind of like
[78:45] filled their cup like they're satisfied
[78:47] in their life or something where they're
[78:48] like no I can help you and I no I'm just
[78:51] happy to help because I know this will
[78:53] be helpful for you and so I think that's
[78:55] part of the community and the community
[78:57] is obviously very motivated you know
[78:59] like any Ponzi scheme right you got to
[79:00] make sure the next dude's coming in too.
[79:06] Exactly. But it is, you know, that's
[79:08] what critics will say. But at the end of
[79:10] the day, you're like, dude, it may it
[79:11] added value to me. I'm just trying to,
[79:14] you know, help you find value as well.
[79:16] Um, absolutely. It's it's a fascin
[79:19] fascinating topic. Uh, and uh, it's it's
[79:22] been a it's been a great pleasure
[79:24] talking with you. You have a lot of
[79:25] knowledge and I think we have to dive
[79:27] into a second rout second round someday
[79:30] because
[79:31] It goes deep and deep and wider and
[79:33] wider with you. I have one question that
[79:35] I asked each and every one of my guests
[79:36] and the question is what can we learn
[79:38] from you besides Bitcoin? Great
[79:40] question. What can you learn from me
[79:42] besides Bitcoin? I suppose my my thing
[79:46] that I'm really into at the moment and I
[79:48] have been for probably the past 3 or 4
[79:50] years is prime numbers. And so if there
[79:54] was anything that I could ever actually
[79:56] No, I'll change it. If we used all the
[80:00] energy that we have to mine bitcoins and
[80:03] we actually translated that to moving
[80:05] blocks like building a pyramid, right?
[80:07] So let's say you built the pyramid that
[80:09] took energy to build the pyramid. So
[80:11] let's say all the energy that it took to
[80:13] build the pyramid. If we put the Bitcoin
[80:16] network's energy, how big would that
[80:18] pyramid be? And the answer is that it
[80:20] goes basically like if that's the Earth,
[80:23] like a round shape, and the moon's over
[80:25] here, the pyramid is like this. like it
[80:28] extends out to the moon. So, I'll send
[80:31] you I'll send you a video. I made like a
[80:32] visual on this like maybe two years ago
[80:35] with a friend of mine. It's actually
[80:37] wild to see. Like this thing is the
[80:39] biggest uh the biggest wonder of the
[80:42] world that we've really ever made and I
[80:45] think that's always something that's
[80:46] quite interesting. So, other than that,
[80:49] yeah, I just like being in the space,
[80:51] being in the community. Started in 2012
[80:55] and hope that I'm here many, many more
[80:56] years. It's the coolest ride. It's like
[80:59] a 4D video game. That's what Bitcoin is
[81:02] like. It is a 4D video game. You will
[81:04] live it, breathe it, eat, and sleep it,
[81:06] but it's going to be really entertaining
[81:08] and really fun and it'll make life
[81:10] really good. That's awesome. uh that
[81:13] picture of like I would love to to see
[81:15] that because I think it's it's it's
[81:17] fascinating to see um it visualized of
[81:21] like how it does it actually look and
[81:22] how big it is because I think our brains
[81:24] are really bad in visualizing uh things
[81:28] especially if it's like exponential or
[81:30] really big or something that you cannot
[81:33] see with your eyes uh directly. Uh so
[81:37] that that that's a really good one.
[81:39] Okay. So I will send it to you. This is
[81:42] so funny. Uh, I'll send it to you right
[81:44] now. But yes, it is wild once you see
[81:46] it. It's It's crazy to think about.
[81:50] Really really cool. We have an
[81:51] entertaining podcast where the previous
[81:52] guest is asking a question for the next
[81:54] guest without knowing who the next guest
[81:55] actually is. And uh, your question from
[81:57] the previous guest is what will be the
[82:00] next country that adopts a Bitcoin
[82:02] strategic reserve? Good question. China.
[82:05] I'd say China if they haven't already.
[82:08] China.
[82:09] Oh, that would be big.
[82:12] Yeah, and I'd be very surprised if they
[82:13] have already. So, yeah, but yeah, it's
[82:17] it's like um if they announce it that
[82:20] that's the that's the part with China.
[82:22] I'm always like uh they probably already
[82:24] have it. I I don't think uh there's any
[82:26] discussion around that. They probably
[82:28] have it. Um but will they tell the world
[82:31] and when will they tell the world? That
[82:33] that that's the more interesting part
[82:34] for me in China. But it's it's
[82:36] interesting to think about that. Thank
[82:37] you so much, Michael, for for being on.
[82:39] Um, before I let you go, where can
[82:41] people find you, ask you questions, and
[82:42] reach out to you? Um, you can find me on
[82:45] GitHub,
[82:48] github.com/miked123 or on Twitter,
[82:51] Michael Dunworth. Um, it's actually
[82:53] Michael Dunwart one, but my name is
[82:56] Michael Dunworth and it should show up.
[82:57] So, yeah. I think you're the first one
[82:59] that said GitHub.
[83:01] Oh, really? As a because it's it's so
[83:04] hard to explain. Yeah. and I actually
[83:06] write my stuff and put it on GitHub.
[83:08] Like it's not technical. Like most of
[83:10] it's not technical. It's just that's
[83:11] actually just the place that I had. I
[83:13] didn't have a blog and it was the login
[83:15] that was on my account. So anyway,
[83:17] there's good stuff there. There's good
[83:19] stuff. That's for sure. I talked with
[83:21] Michael Sullivan and he writes his books
[83:25] in uh Visual Studio Code.
[83:31] How good is that, dude? There you go.
[83:34] That's the That's his thing. Everyone's
[83:36] got a thing.
[83:38] So, I think uh yeah, it's really
[83:41] interesting when someone doesn't say
[83:43] Twitter, but yeah, today is usually the
[83:44] main one. Thank you so much um for being
[83:46] on. Also, thank you so much for everyone
[83:48] that is watching and listening, for
[83:49] joining us today. As always, I'll be
[83:51] back tomorrow with another episode.
[83:52] Bye-bye. Thank you. See you.
