[00:00] the ramifications of that in my opinion
[00:02] is a far stronger more vital More Alive
[00:05] more beautiful culture and therefore a
[00:06] better civilization Bitcoin doesn't just
[00:08] magically fix you like it's not
[00:10] it's not like some magic pill that you
[00:12] pop and all of a sudden you become
[00:14] virtuous and you know a great person no
[00:16] no no these virtues need to be
[00:17] consciously worked on we need to define
[00:19] or decide what those virtues are now
[00:22] before we get mega Rich because it's too
[00:24] late then if you're an idiot and then
[00:26] all of a sudden you end up with a lot of
[00:27] money you just have more money to be an
[00:29] idiot with the current Paradigm cannot
[00:31] last and it is self-defeating the Fiat
[00:33] system is basically the master of
[00:35] scoring own goals Bitcoin is a new
[00:38] paradigm which ticks all the boxes that
[00:41] obviously gold had it ticks all the
[00:43] boxes that Fiat had and it ticks some
[00:45] new boxes that neither of them have the
[00:47] computer that I'm talking to you on the
[00:48] headphones the seat this that I'm
[00:50] sitting on the house that I'm in at the
[00:52] moment the car that I drove on the way
[00:53] here like all of this stuff needs to be
[00:54] measured in Bitcoin that's not going to
[00:56] happen overnight that's not going to
[00:57] happen in our generation we're going to
[00:58] move on to a new socioeconomic Paradigm
[01:00] and we need a new playbook the current
[01:02] Playbook on the current socioeconomic
[01:04] Paradigm in the Fiat land is lie cheat
[01:06] steal get into politics bureaucrat HR
[01:08] departments steel steel steel parasite
[01:10] parasite parasite that's the playbook
[01:12] for winning today on a new socio
[01:13] economic standard we'll need a new
[01:15] playbook and I believe that Playbook has
[01:17] to do with these key virtues honesty
[01:19] Integrity courage Justice self-control
[01:22] respect honor
[01:24] [Music]
[01:27] compassion um why do you think Bitcoin
[01:30] will win and what what do you think is
[01:31] like the the implications of of Bitcoin
[01:33] winning for for
[01:35] us I
[01:37] think Bitcoin is going to win just by
[01:41] pure how can I say strength so you've
[01:44] you've got you've got a weakening
[01:46] existing Paradigm so the the current
[01:50] Paradigm of the world is Fiat it's
[01:53] structured around cheating it's
[01:55] structured around average around
[01:57] weakness around lying around all of
[02:00] these like virtues which I would argue
[02:02] are anti-life particularly with like
[02:04] Central Banking like you are
[02:06] fundamentally weakening the monetary
[02:08] Base by the existence of Central Banking
[02:11] you're printing money you're making
[02:12] everyone poorer you're you're you're
[02:14] basically unraveling and destroying the
[02:16] capital base so the the current Paradigm
[02:18] cannot last and it is self-defeating
[02:21] Bitcoin is a new paradigm which ticks
[02:25] all the boxes that obviously gold had it
[02:29] ticks all the boxes that Fiat had and it
[02:31] ticks some new boxes that neither of
[02:33] them had so it's like strong across the
[02:36] board and by virtue of the fact that
[02:39] people have
[02:41] the a motivation for
[02:44] self-preservation in time they're going
[02:46] to move across to Bitcoin now I'm not
[02:49] one of these people that thinks it's
[02:50] going to happen this
[02:51] decade in my opinion it'll take a couple
[02:53] of generations but that is is not I I
[03:00] don't say that as a way to disparage
[03:03] Bitcoin but more
[03:06] to imply that Bitcoin is bigger than
[03:08] what we all
[03:10] think like for something so fundamental
[03:13] to shift like the for the entire
[03:16] socioeconomic Paradigm to shift and for
[03:20] everything on the planet to be measured
[03:22] in
[03:23] Bitcoin that's like mind boggly big like
[03:28] I I don't think people appreciate that
[03:30] that the the computer that I'm talking
[03:32] to you on the headphones the seat that
[03:35] I'm sitting on the house that I'm in at
[03:36] the moment the car that I drove on the
[03:38] way here like all of this stuff needs to
[03:39] be measured in Bitcoin that's not going
[03:41] to happen overnight that's not going to
[03:42] happen in our generation it's going to
[03:43] happen in the subsequent and the
[03:45] subsequent of the subsequent generation
[03:46] so the magnitude of this change is
[03:49] extraordinarily large because of
[03:53] that so you got kind of two factors here
[03:55] you've got Bitcoin is rising it'll
[03:57] become more important it'll become more
[03:59] strong and it'll happen over generations
[04:01] and at the same time we have the time
[04:03] for the existing uh status quo to weaken
[04:07] to keep itself over sorry if I'm
[04:10] not allowed to swear but basically the
[04:12] the Fiat system is basically the the
[04:14] master of scoring own goals right that's
[04:18] the that's the situation we're playing
[04:20] here so ultimately Bitcoin wins and the
[04:23] second question what implications does
[04:24] it have I was at a conference in Prague
[04:27] recently and I gave a talk called called
[04:29] Beauty will save the
[04:31] world and in there I said that look sure
[04:35] Bitcoin will help Bank the unbanked and
[04:38] it's a great store of value and all this
[04:40] sort of stuff like that that's all
[04:42] important but I think what's most
[04:44] important to me at least is that Bitcoin
[04:46] establishes a framework for excellence
[04:50] and what I mean by that is by making it
[04:54] more difficult
[04:56] to more difficult for institutionalized
[04:59] stealing
[05:00] and cheating and lying and politicking
[05:04] by making the institutionalization of
[05:06] that more difficult you create a
[05:08] framework where other virtues such as
[05:12] Excellence such as courage such as honor
[05:15] respect Integrity all of these sorts of
[05:17] things become more valued and more
[05:19] prized because that becomes the way to
[05:20] win the ramifications of that in my
[05:23] opinion is a far stronger more vital
[05:26] More Alive more beautiful culture and
[05:29] therefore for a better civilization so I
[05:30] think that's the bigger impact and more
[05:33] important that impact that Bitcoin will
[05:35] have but all of that is obviously
[05:37] Downstream of fixing the money and also
[05:40] human beings fixing themselves we can't
[05:42] just expect Bitcoin to magically fix us
[05:45] so that's a long answer to your question
[05:47] that's an that's an interesting take and
[05:50] my mind was going there where you you
[05:53] probably like everybody knows that like
[05:55] hard times great strong uh man and like
[05:58] down the road this this I I think
[05:59] everyone is familiar with that saying um
[06:03] is is it possible that with Bitcoin now
[06:06] that we don't go off the the good times
[06:09] that we create this like abundance and
[06:11] and everyone has to actually put in the
[06:13] proof of work and has the right mindset
[06:15] and as force and that's why we we don't
[06:18] go off this this up and down streams
[06:21] unfortunately I don't think so uh I
[06:23] think we're always going to have strong
[06:24] men uh creating good times good times
[06:27] creating weak Men We creating hard times
[06:29] I think the and I grappled with this for
[06:32] almost 50 pages in the book uh maybe not
[06:35] that long maybe 20 30 pages in the book
[06:37] but I grapple with this concept I'm okay
[06:40] can we get away from seasons and
[06:42] Cycles uh is is it like a because it's
[06:46] almost like a you know what what do the
[06:48] central planners try and do they're like
[06:50] oh look there's a business cycle so
[06:51] let's avoid the business cycle by
[06:52] printing money and propping things up
[06:53] when things get bad right so it's almost
[06:55] like a central Bankers uh frame of mind
[06:58] to say that oh with Bitcoin we're going
[07:00] to avoid the Cycles well no we're not
[07:03] unfortunately as material wealth
[07:05] increases so too does entitlement so too
[07:09] does liberalism so too does more leftist
[07:12] thinking so all of this sort of stuff
[07:14] comes as a result of increased material
[07:15] wealth and at some point you get to that
[07:18] stage of the weak
[07:20] men uh period and they do start to
[07:23] dismantle civilization make things hard
[07:26] again and then the Hard Men rise again
[07:28] so in my opinion we don't get away from
[07:30] it at the very least what we do is this
[07:34] we build a structure that is more able
[07:37] to withstand the weak men period of time
[07:41] and what I mean by that is this I I'll
[07:44] I'll explain it by way of an analogy so
[07:45] imagine you have the seasons summer fall
[07:50] uh winter spring and whatever the order
[07:53] is if you know that uh so let me explain
[07:56] it this way you've got a house that
[07:58] needs to be built to with stand the
[08:00] seasons right so you build it out of
[08:02] wood and you build a bunch of wood and
[08:05] it helps us stay alive through the
[08:08] winter right because before every other
[08:10] winter everyone was dying so you build
[08:11] it out of uh wood and all of a sudden
[08:14] you're getting through a number of
[08:15] winters and people get become more
[08:17] complacent they become more entitled and
[08:19] at some point you end up getting this
[08:21] sort of uh this period of entitled brats
[08:24] weak men who are like you know what I'm
[08:26] not going to go outside and I'm not
[08:27] going to cut any trees anymore I'm not
[08:29] going to cut any more firewood we have
[08:31] enough it let's just keep warming
[08:33] ourselves up because I'm too fat lazy
[08:36] whatever the case is too entitled to go
[08:37] and do that so they run out of firewood
[08:39] and the winter comes again and they're
[08:42] cold and they're like what do I do
[08:43] now so then they start taking the chairs
[08:47] that are in the house they start taking
[08:48] the table they start ripping down the
[08:50] doors and they're using all of this as
[08:52] firewood because they're too uh
[08:55] concerned about going outside and doing
[08:57] the actual work so they start eroding
[08:59] the capital and at some point the future
[09:02] generation that comes in after them all
[09:03] of a sudden doesn't have a house left
[09:05] and they freeze to death right so that's
[09:07] kind of what's happening in the Fiat
[09:08] stage at the moment is the the Fiat
[09:10] stage that we're in the weak men stage
[09:12] of the cycle that we're in we are
[09:13] dismantling the capital that has been
[09:15] built over hundreds of years or
[09:18] thousands of years really and we're
[09:20] wondering why things are breaking
[09:22] whereas on a Bitcoin standard I would
[09:24] say that the winter is still going to
[09:26] come the entitled brats are still going
[09:29] to come
[09:30] but we'll have a structure or a house
[09:34] that is more made of steel and glass and
[09:37] stone and wood and all of this mixture
[09:38] of things so it's more robust so the
[09:41] idiots basically don't burn the house
[09:43] down before the Next Generation comes in
[09:46] so with that being said I think Bitcoin
[09:48] will help lower the amplitude of damage
[09:52] or the magnitude of Damage Done during
[09:54] the weak stage that's very interesting
[09:56] and it's like I think you uh you have a
[09:59] TR of the on the in the book uh on on
[10:03] the how's the the site called where you
[10:05] raise money for the book yeah yeah yeah
[10:08] yeah why and there's a trailer of the
[10:09] book and and you raised a question that
[10:11] I never asked myself or ask anyone else
[10:15] um I think you it was in that trailer
[10:18] please correct me if I'm wrong but will
[10:19] the new generation of like OG bitcoiners
[10:23] um kind of be the next Elite and be the
[10:25] next like uh people who exploit the the
[10:29] people that are late to bitcoin or the
[10:31] no coiners uh because like when when
[10:34] Bitcoin goes where we think it goes um
[10:38] and we have bitcoiners now that bought
[10:41] Bitcoin under 100 EUR under a thousand
[10:44] Euros even under 100,000 euros um and
[10:46] Bitcoin at some point is just so high
[10:48] that like Fe don't even exist they
[10:51] probably have a lot of power and a lot
[10:53] of influence do you think the the OG
[10:56] wealthy bitcoiners could could uh
[10:58] exploit the the new generation of of uh
[11:02] yeah the new working class absolutely so
[11:05] I think there's two things to point out
[11:07] here number one is that there's nothing
[11:09] wrong with power and influence uh it's
[11:12] it's actually a gift and it's a
[11:14] responsibility the challenge comes when
[11:16] weak people attain both power and
[11:19] influence so when strong people attain
[11:21] it they use the power and influence as a
[11:23] means to an end whereas weak people
[11:26] generally use power and influence as the
[11:27] end right and you see that with
[11:30] Communists for example they're ugly weak
[11:32] disgusting people and they use power to
[11:33] bring everybody down to their level
[11:35] whereas strong people use power and
[11:38] influence to raise civilization up to
[11:40] make it more vital to make it more
[11:42] ascendent it's it's a very different end
[11:44] so so that being said though and this is
[11:47] the important this is exactly why I
[11:48] wrote the
[11:49] book is it's not so clear to me that
[11:54] those who have Bitcoin today and who
[11:57] will become uh dis
[11:59] proportionately economically powerful
[12:01] and
[12:02] influential will also become virtuous
[12:06] it's it's not very clear to me because
[12:08] if we look at the the history of Bitcoin
[12:11] people who got into Bitcoin at like a
[12:13] dollar or $2 or $5 or $10 the ones that
[12:16] held on to it generally become
[12:18] coiners they become degenerates they
[12:21] become Lambo retards they either get
[12:24] into some sort of politics or whatever
[12:26] like so so so far we don't actually have
[12:28] a great track record a there's a small
[12:30] group of people who have been or who
[12:33] have chosen to be more virtuous like
[12:37] there is a there is a you know I guess
[12:40] you could call like the safadin of the
[12:41] world and the ggs of the world and you
[12:43] know there's people like that that have
[12:45] held on and they've used Bitcoin as a as
[12:49] a mechanism for channeling virtue and
[12:51] good behavior and nobility and all of
[12:53] these of these powerful virtues but you
[12:56] know you look at the Brian Armstrongs
[12:58] theal berans the the Brock piercers and
[13:02] the Roger and like all of these people
[13:04] who are generally really early to
[13:06] bitcoin what did they do they became
[13:08] degenerates they became a parasitic
[13:11] class they became political they tried
[13:12] to change Bitcoin they did all this
[13:13] weird
[13:15] so my argument of the book is that look
[13:19] Bitcoin doesn't just magically
[13:21] fix you like it's not it's not like some
[13:24] magic pill that you pop and all of a
[13:26] sudden you become virtuous and you know
[13:28] a great person no no no
[13:29] these virtues need to be consciously
[13:32] worked on and we need to define or
[13:35] decide what those virtues are now before
[13:38] we get mega Rich right because it's too
[13:41] late then like if if you if you all of a
[13:43] sudden if you're an idiot and then all
[13:44] of a sudden you end up with a lot of
[13:45] money you just have more money to be an
[13:48] idiot with right that's why people who
[13:50] win the lottery are generally like
[13:52] morons like they get lucky they win the
[13:54] lotto they burn through all their money
[13:56] they do a bunch of damage and then like
[13:58] they're back to square one right so my
[14:01] fear is that many Bitcoin has end up
[14:02] with that and some of them might just
[14:04] end up like not intentionally being bad
[14:07] people but they haven't worked on
[14:09] themselves they haven't built character
[14:11] they haven't established a set of
[14:13] Virtues or principles to live by and
[14:15] then all of a sudden their life is a
[14:17] mess they get a bunch more money and
[14:19] they have more to be a mess with and
[14:21] that's really dangerous so this is why
[14:23] in my opinion the greatest cultures
[14:25] throughout history those that preceded
[14:27] the greatest civilizations spent a lot
[14:29] of time developing virtues particularly
[14:33] in the warrior class because the warrior
[14:34] class is the class in Civilization that
[14:36] inspires those below them and is a
[14:41] beacon for those above them because
[14:42] those above them uh depend on them right
[14:44] so the warrior class generally is the
[14:46] one where the virtues were most
[14:48] inculcated and those virtues were
[14:49] generally things like courage like
[14:52] compassion like justice like
[14:54] responsibility like respect and Duty and
[14:56] loyalty and self-control and all of
[14:58] these things right so in my opinion we
[15:02] must seek to start developing that now
[15:05] so that as Bitcoin starts to succeed we
[15:08] kind of like catch up with Bitcoin and
[15:12] are people worthy of the power and the
[15:15] influence that we're going to be able to
[15:17] wield when Bitcoin is $500,000 a million
[15:21] 5 million 10 million 20 million that
[15:23] that has to start now you don't just
[15:25] become virtuous overnight so so that's
[15:27] the premise of the book I lay out
[15:29] what are the virtues what matters who
[15:31] must we become before we get Ultra rich
[15:35] and wealthy and how can we then
[15:37] inculcate those values in into our
[15:40] Offspring what is the warrior class uh
[15:43] what is where is this coming from so
[15:47] specifically when I was writing the
[15:49] book I looked at okay what were the
[15:51] greatest civilizations on
[15:54] Earth the modern West medieval Japan the
[15:58] r Romans the Greeks they're sort of the
[16:00] four that I really um focused in on
[16:02] Medieval Europe as well and I looked at
[16:06] okay what preceded these civilizations
[16:08] and what preceded these civilizations
[16:10] was a particular kind of culture right a
[16:12] culture that was generally Excellence
[16:14] oriented it was quite hierarchical um
[16:17] there was a particular way of being um
[16:21] there was particular virtues that were
[16:23] embodied by this um by this culture and
[16:27] then I looked at what the virtues are
[16:28] and
[16:29] the way you can think about what the
[16:30] word virtue means it means almost like a
[16:32] blend of principles and behavior so
[16:36] virtues is like how how you behave who
[16:38] you are right it's different to a value
[16:41] a value is more something that is like
[16:43] you want to experience a virtue is how
[16:46] you behave right and values are
[16:49] generally Downstream of Virtues like if
[16:53] you value
[16:54] Freedom you must behave responsibly and
[16:58] have
[16:59] autonomy in order to feel freedom right
[17:02] if you renounce your responsibility that
[17:05] means you don't value Freedom right
[17:07] because by giving up your responsibility
[17:09] you're no longer free you are dependent
[17:11] on somebody else you are a dependent if
[17:13] you're not
[17:14] responsible so anyway that being said
[17:16] these virtues that I looked into them in
[17:19] all of these great
[17:21] cultures the virtues were established by
[17:24] the warrior class so in Japan it was the
[17:26] samurai in uh the West it was the
[17:30] knights in Rome it was the legionaires
[17:33] in Greece it was the hoplight or the
[17:36] fanks right it was it was always the
[17:38] warrior classes because the the lower
[17:41] classes those below the Warriors they
[17:42] looked up to the Warriors because the
[17:44] Warriors defended them nobody else the
[17:47] the farmers The Artisans the merchants
[17:49] The Peasants nobody really had a
[17:51] territorial life without the Warriors
[17:54] defending them and the nobility the
[17:56] aristocracy the royalty the Kings didn't
[18:00] have a territory and didn't have rule
[18:02] without the warrior class so the warrior
[18:03] class s of stood out as a beacon of
[18:07] uh as a beacon of behavior or a beacon
[18:10] of character and it was their virtues
[18:14] that were embedded within these cultures
[18:17] which preceded the greater civilization
[18:20] so that's where I drew the virtues from
[18:22] and what I found was that across all of
[18:24] these cultures the virtues just
[18:26] overlapped you know you you have like
[18:28] particularly the the Japanese during the
[18:31] feudal age with the samurai you compare
[18:34] that with the west and the night during
[18:37] the feudal age it's almost the same
[18:39] thing and these people had no
[18:41] interaction with each other like it
[18:43] happened at the same time with the same
[18:45] class of people with the same virtues
[18:48] with zero relationship between each
[18:50] other and I found that super fascinating
[18:53] I was like okay that means there must be
[18:55] truth here and and that was the the
[18:57] premise of why I chose those virtues and
[18:59] how the war class inspired
[19:01] it so the book as I understand it now um
[19:06] has to
[19:07] goal to prepare
[19:11] bitcoiners what to come for Bitcoin and
[19:14] for the new
[19:16] world pretty much I the argument is that
[19:20] we're going to move on to a new
[19:21] socioeconomic Paradigm and we need a new
[19:23] playbook the current Playbook on the
[19:26] current socio economic Paradigm in the
[19:27] Fiat land is lie cheat steal get into
[19:30] politics bureaucrat HR departments steel
[19:33] steel steel parasite parasite parasite
[19:35] that's the playbook for winning today on
[19:37] a new socio economic standard we'll need
[19:39] a new playbook and I believe that
[19:41] Playbook has to do with these key
[19:43] virtues honesty Integrity courage
[19:46] Justice self-control respect honor
[19:51] compassion all of that sort of stuff you
[19:53] mentioned before Communists um and for
[19:56] me it's really interesting when we look
[19:57] at money and when we look at Bitcoin now
[20:01] uh I feel like we have for the first
[20:03] time ever the a real chance of actually
[20:07] um eliminating the connection between
[20:10] government uh governments and money it's
[20:13] always kind of the the connection
[20:15] between there uh do we therefore also
[20:18] eliminate um communism and socialism uh
[20:22] because money is free and and we have a
[20:25] a free market um basis and and nobody
[20:29] can actually control it man I hope so
[20:33] one of the one of the Lynch pins for
[20:35] communism is obviously get control of
[20:37] the money and then socialize the wealth
[20:40] um I'm optimistic I'm
[20:44] optimistic because yeah like I don't see
[20:47] how socialism can function at scale
[20:50] without having access to the monetary
[20:53] spigot I mean this is a now like you
[20:56] could argue that somebody could come
[21:00] into a territory and claim power and
[21:05] amass power and be you know someone that
[21:07] uses guilt to make a entire class of
[21:11] people basically um I don't know vote
[21:16] for the beheading like this is sort of
[21:17] what happened in France right in the in
[21:20] the uh in the French Revolution what
[21:24] idiots think it was a good thing but was
[21:25] a really really bad thing for Western
[21:27] Civilization is
[21:29] they even even though like France wasn't
[21:32] really printing money it was you know on
[21:33] a gold standard it wasn't on a Fiat
[21:35] standard um they managed to round up a
[21:38] bunch of people they killed off a bunch
[21:40] of the nobility they killed off a bunch
[21:42] of the monarchies monarchists they
[21:44] killed off a bunch of the Royals and
[21:46] they plunged the country into a leftist
[21:49] dystopia so it can potentially still
[21:51] happen uh I just think that it'll be
[21:54] much harder in the future with the
[21:57] existence of uh Bitcoin so I don't know
[22:00] I I hope I'm cautiously
[22:03] optimistic what is your favorite um
[22:06] virtue like you talked about the warrior
[22:09] mindset uh and and you kind of collected
[22:12] from all those different uh from the kns
[22:14] from the summar and all all the things
[22:17] um what is your favorite like the the
[22:19] one thing uh that Bitcoin has definitely
[22:22] have to uh adopt or uh have to have in
[22:26] order to like exceed in in the New World
[22:29] yeah it's hard um I've always held very
[22:33] close to my heart the the virtue of
[22:36] Courage uh I I don't think anything
[22:38] Works without courage in in the book I
[22:41] call it uh faith in action or something
[22:45] like that it it encourages the ability
[22:47] to do something even though you can't
[22:49] see it even though you're afraid even
[22:51] though it's like inconceivable it is the
[22:56] capacity to do it despite that fact and
[23:01] to me that's that's quite powerful now
[23:04] arguably to be a bitcoiner requires
[23:07] quite a bit of Courage already so people
[23:09] probably have that ingredient uh being
[23:11] bitcoiners um
[23:13] already so beyond that um I think the
[23:16] the one
[23:18] so I let let me preframe this by saying
[23:21] that I think courage is just fundamental
[23:24] but I think a lot of Bitcoins already
[23:25] have a predisposition for courage which
[23:27] means the one that we are most missing
[23:30] or that Bitcoin is in general the most
[23:31] missing that they need I believe is
[23:33] Excellence Excellence is the opposite to
[23:35] average and I think this is a big a big
[23:37] hole in a lot of bitcoin's philosophy
[23:39] everyone runs around and says you know
[23:41] I'm a pleb and we are all Satoshi and
[23:43] there's you know there strength in
[23:44] numbers Vos and numerous and you know
[23:46] all this sort of stuff which to me
[23:49] honestly sounds very communist I I get
[23:51] that it's not communist I get that when
[23:53] you know we say we're all sto we're
[23:54] talking about the anonymity set um I get
[23:57] that when people talking about pledge
[23:58] what they're saying is trying to create
[24:00] a separation between fake Elites and
[24:03] people who are hardworking want to build
[24:05] something but in the book and I speak
[24:07] about this quite a bit it's that look
[24:10] the the plebians or or the average man
[24:13] is the is the cancer that the globalists
[24:17] and the ugly people have infected our
[24:19] brains with to make us think that
[24:22] average is somehow something to be
[24:24] admired and Excellence is something to
[24:26] be scorned against but it's the opposite
[24:29] Excellence is the only Pathway to Beauty
[24:32] you you cannot like the word excellent
[24:34] and I go through this in the book like
[24:36] every single virtue I spend the first
[24:38] two pages looking at the Japanese
[24:40] atmology the English atmology the Latin
[24:42] atmology and I look at what the basis of
[24:44] these words are like what the do
[24:45] they actually mean and with Excellence
[24:47] you have the word is made up of two uh
[24:50] components egg and cair which is to do
[24:53] with the
[24:54] separation of the mountain from the flat
[24:57] land right so Excellence is about
[24:59] climbing a mountain about separating
[25:02] oneself Excellence is by definition for
[25:06] the few Excellence is not an average
[25:09] thing like literally excellence and
[25:10] average are Polar Opposites they don't
[25:13] exist in the same frame of reference um
[25:16] Excellence is
[25:18] hierarchical Excellence is exclusionary
[25:21] Excellence is not comfortable Excellence
[25:24] is what is required for growth
[25:25] Excellence requires separation
[25:27] Excellence is Elite Excellence is
[25:29] aristocratic Excellence is Noble
[25:31] Excellence is all of these things which
[25:33] is very different to pleb and average
[25:35] and we aloshi and all that sort of stuff
[25:37] so I think this is a big weakness in
[25:40] just general uh the general Bitcoin
[25:43] Consciousness which I'm personally
[25:45] challenging which is I challenge people
[25:48] who are going to be the socio economic
[25:51] Elite to stop calling themselves average
[25:54] stop finding nobility and average and
[25:59] start start like accepting the fact that
[26:02] you're going to be socioeconomically
[26:03] more significant than most people if
[26:05] you're a Bitcoin or now um also start
[26:09] looking at what are the the virtues that
[26:12] you need to embody and particularly
[26:15] Excellence like start becoming
[26:16] comfortable with not only pushing
[26:20] yourself to uh Excellence so like
[26:23] demanding the best of yourself in the
[26:25] physical sense in the intellectual sense
[26:27] the psych iCal sense the emotional sense
[26:30] the the spiritual sense like all of
[26:31] these things like push yourself but
[26:34] also both admire and support others who
[26:37] do that themselves so I see this a lot
[26:40] and you know I grew up in Australia and
[26:41] we've got this thing called The Tall
[26:42] puppy syndrome you see someone succeed a
[26:44] little bit and you try and cut them down
[26:46] right and that comes from envy that
[26:47] comes from resentment that comes from
[26:49] this sort of like crabs in a bucket
[26:51] mentality it's like oh you know if
[26:52] somebody starts getting ahead we better
[26:54] bring them back down because we're all
[26:56] average and we're all in this together
[26:57] no no no that that's a that's a
[26:59] really bad
[27:01] uh frame of mind if you see someone
[27:03] succeeding get behind them support them
[27:06] and use that to inspire you to succeed
[27:08] and that's how we all climb like the
[27:09] more of us climbing the mountain the
[27:11] more ascendant civilization becomes the
[27:13] more of us bringing everybody down to
[27:15] the flat line the more average we become
[27:17] and average is the first step to death
[27:19] like average is the opposite direction
[27:21] to Excellence so if I had to sum up your
[27:23] question I know it's a long answer to it
[27:24] but courage is fundamentally important
[27:27] and you in fact courag is the driver for
[27:29] excellence but Excellence is the big the
[27:32] big ho in Bitcoin a mindset at least
[27:35] from what I can tell thank you you
[27:36] already made it halfway through the
[27:38] video and I'm really really grateful to
[27:40] have you here two things make this
[27:42] channel possible you as a watcher and
[27:45] listener who keep supporting this
[27:47] Channel and another one is all the
[27:49] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[27:51] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[27:54] very start and where I personally buy my
[27:56] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[27:57] get get a discount when you buy Bitcoin
[28:00] with them and now also bitbox bitbox is
[28:03] the simplest and securest way to secure
[28:06] your Bitcoin and I heard a crazy
[28:08] statistics only 2% of bitcoiners hold
[28:11] their Bitcoin in a hardware wallet how
[28:13] crazy is that don't be in that 98%
[28:16] bracket be in the 2% bracket and if you
[28:19] have self- custody and you know your
[28:20] friend does not have maybe he needs a
[28:22] Christmas present maybe he needs a
[28:24] birthday present and a small life hack
[28:26] if you use code Robin you get five 5%
[28:28] off your order plus you support my
[28:31] channel and now let's get back to the
[28:33] video I I I love that a lot and I see
[28:36] that myself
[28:38] with there are Concepts in in in Bitcoin
[28:41] there's like this proof of work mindset
[28:43] there's like this low time preference
[28:45] mindset and I sometimes see that
[28:47] bitcoiners are using low time preference
[28:50] as an excuse to be lazy totally totally
[28:53] I I I I've seen that like uh so so many
[28:56] times like oh no no I do it only like
[28:59] once a month or do this like not too
[29:02] many even with my podcast that's why I
[29:04] do it every day uh people uh don't Gras
[29:08] why why I do a daily podcast with every
[29:10] single day a different podcast guest
[29:12] like there's like there's a lot of
[29:13] interviews to do this week I have 11 um
[29:18] if I want to be average I do like two
[29:20] maybe three most do that and I want to
[29:24] be better than that I know that there
[29:26] are already so many
[29:29] podcasters um like b m comic there
[29:31] Natalie Brunell there are so many bigger
[29:34] ones way bigger ones that started way
[29:35] earli than me the only chance for me
[29:38] even having a chance of of being on the
[29:40] same level with them I have to massively
[29:43] out to compete them in in the quantity
[29:46] and then the quality will catch up uh so
[29:48] that's uh I I see it sometimes like oh
[29:51] no lower your time preference do it two
[29:53] times a week get the quality right it's
[29:56] like no no I want to do it every day and
[29:59] I want to still have my quality right so
[30:02] I I I like a lot what you saying in in
[30:04] the book and with excellence and uh
[30:06] detaching yourself from from average and
[30:09] trying to excel in in in every single
[30:12] way and I'm really curious about the
[30:14] book I I really have to to pick it up
[30:16] and I'm I'm really you you got me now
[30:19] interested um so yeah it's it's really
[30:22] interesting thank you yeah no it's a
[30:24] it's
[30:26] a it's become a play in modern
[30:28] civilization and it happens inside
[30:30] Bitcoin and outside Bitcoin is people
[30:33] have started to uh replace reverence or
[30:39] uh admiration for envy and resentment
[30:41] right and envy and resentment are the
[30:44] ugliest ugliest possible
[30:47] um uh attributes or vices or emotions
[30:52] right like Envy is and like n spoke
[30:56] about this 150 years ago right is he he
[30:59] described how the way modern
[31:02] civilization was going in the
[31:03] introduction of these sort of
[31:04] equalitarian and Democratic principles
[31:07] will lead to a time
[31:09] when the masses become fundamentally
[31:13] envious and resentful of anything
[31:14] beautiful anything great anything High
[31:17] anything Noble and it's happening you
[31:19] look at all these Psychopathic eot
[31:21] terrorists you know they see a beautiful
[31:23] statue so what do they think they think
[31:25] they should knock it over or they should
[31:27] stick their hand into it or they should
[31:28] throw paint on the painting or
[31:30] something like that it's like it's
[31:31] absolutely mindboggling right the kind
[31:33] of stupidity that is happening today but
[31:35] it stems from that place of lack of
[31:38] ugliness of resentment from Envy like
[31:41] it's these and and it's always the
[31:43] people who you see like their own lives
[31:44] are broken they have no meaning in life
[31:47] so that they go and try and tear other
[31:49] things down and it's absolutely
[31:51] disgusting I hate it and I see
[31:55] lighter elements of that ins
[31:58] Bitcoin and
[31:59] inside every other industry and we need
[32:01] to we need to stamp that out it's
[32:03] it's absolute evil yeah I see it a lot I
[32:06] don't know I always hear that it's in
[32:08] America better uh but in Austria and in
[32:11] Europe we have kind of this mindset um
[32:14] when we see someone succeed we're Envy
[32:16] of them we we are like oh he has to do
[32:19] some dirty business he has to do some
[32:21] bad things he's part of like some bad
[32:23] groups and not like like Oh How He how
[32:27] did he do knew it let's let's sit down
[32:29] with him and let's ask him hey what did
[32:31] you do how how can I benefit from it
[32:34] what can I learn from you like that the
[32:36] the Curiosity just seeing someone like
[32:39] when I see someone uh succeeding I see
[32:42] someone in my friends group was I see
[32:44] someone at a Bitcoin conference or
[32:46] whatever and he made a really successful
[32:48] whatever I I generally ask and this is
[32:51] kind of also how the podcast came to be
[32:54] I generally ask how did you get there
[32:57] what what was your learn earnings and
[32:58] what how what can I take away from that
[33:00] like um you have a massive advantage and
[33:03] the one feels flatter like you you win
[33:06] and and B it's such a great thing uh to
[33:09] do and it's such an easy thing to do but
[33:10] like there's some Envy some resentment
[33:13] in in us that that kind of holds us back
[33:16] I feel like yeah and that's that's
[33:18] something that's a demon we must all
[33:20] contend with and that's why to for for
[33:23] your question I specifically
[33:25] picked uh Excellence as is the thing we
[33:28] need to work on Amazing uh work on is a
[33:33] great um great uh guide to to our next
[33:36] question um you said in the beginning
[33:39] that you also want to uh talk about
[33:40] santis and Nostra I never heard about
[33:43] santis I have literally no clue what
[33:45] this is I heard about Nostra of course
[33:47] I'm on Nostra also um but what are you
[33:49] doing there so last year I spent I'll
[33:54] give some context and background so it
[33:55] makes more sense but last year I spent
[33:57] the year going down the AI Rabbit Hole
[34:00] um and unlike Bitcoin you know when you
[34:02] go down the rabbit hole you discover
[34:04] more and more interesting stuff you get
[34:06] more bullish you get more interested you
[34:08] go down more rabbit holes Etc when I
[34:11] went down the AI Rabbit Hole it was the
[34:12] opposite the more and more I went down
[34:14] the more stupid I discovered it was I
[34:16] was like okay this is a scam this is
[34:17]  this is just the probability
[34:19] machine it's all Hocus Pocus it's like
[34:21] Wizard of Oz so after a good I mean I'd
[34:26] say 9 months like intense down the
[34:28] rabbit hole but like a good 12 months I
[34:30] was messing around with this stuff I
[34:32] realized that there's no business there
[34:33] it's a big bubble uh it's all going to
[34:35] pop and it's going to you know the
[34:37] show is going to end so along the way
[34:40] somebody approached me and said hey do
[34:42] you think we could build a travel
[34:45] concierge uh that's like an AI That's
[34:47] like a
[34:48] chatbot so like chat gbt for travel that
[34:52] knows all the Bitcoin locations I was
[34:54] like okay interesting idea we Workshop
[34:55] that we realized yeah that's not the
[34:57] right
[34:58] uh it's not the right uh what's the word
[35:01] like experience it's not the right
[35:03] interface a better interface is more
[35:05] like a like a trip advisor or a nomad
[35:07] list or something like that where you
[35:09] can get a visual sense of what's going
[35:11] on so we started building like a a
[35:13] Bitcoin travel directory we were going
[35:15] to call it destination Bitcoin and the
[35:18] more we dug into it the more we realized
[35:20] that hey we want to have ambassadors
[35:22] locally how are we going to validate the
[35:23] ambassadors well maybe we can use the
[35:25] Noster account oh well what else can
[35:27] nost offer oh maybe we can
[35:29] integrate the uh the nosto social graph
[35:33] to make the locations more relevant so
[35:37] when you go to a different location if
[35:39] you're interested in food and I'm
[35:41] interested in Bitcoin we should see
[35:43] different things in the location we
[35:44] should see different meetups different
[35:46] events different Merchants different uh
[35:48] content on the feed Etc so the idea
[35:51] basically evolved into I don't even know
[35:54] what to call it where where sort of the
[35:55] the working title is a travel Nomad and
[36:00] Community social network so people can
[36:04] look at it at atlantis. the current
[36:06] iteration of the product is way more
[36:08] like a web directory and you can
[36:11] basically go and see different cities
[36:14] you can get a sense for the cities like
[36:16] how like are they walkable are they safe
[36:18] what's the cost of living like all this
[36:20] sort of scoring you can go into the city
[36:22] you can see what people are associated
[36:24] with the city so I know one big problem
[36:26] for bitcoiners which aren't pill up to
[36:28] some degree tried to solve but it just
[36:29] it's it's a bit weird like just being
[36:31] randomly contacted by people whereas on
[36:33] Noster like you can build a following
[36:35] and you can contact someone you can see
[36:37] if it's someone you know if you got
[36:38] mutual friends or whatever but basically
[36:41] on on this you can go to the city and
[36:43] you can see who's in the city like who's
[36:45] a resident who's an ambassador who's
[36:47] following the city you can then connect
[36:48] with people you can see what else is
[36:50] going on you can join events you can
[36:52] find Merchants you can do all this sort
[36:53] of stuff and it's um it's taken on a of
[36:57] its own here we are like 6 months into
[36:59] it we're building effectively a super
[37:01] app but yeah the basic vision is that
[37:05] it's it's somewhere that people can go
[37:11] to
[37:13] discover who's there what to do uh what
[37:16] events to go to what's interesting about
[37:19] the city Etc all influenced by your
[37:22] social graph and that's where the Noster
[37:24] piece comes in and what in my opinion is
[37:26] really interesting about Noster is it's
[37:27] a portable social graph if you could
[37:29] carry your social graph around and embed
[37:32] it into different applications different
[37:35] applications should be informed by that
[37:38] social graph in other words different
[37:39] applications can be made Dynamic based
[37:42] on your nost social graph and to me
[37:44] that's the nost superpower that not
[37:45] enough people are talking about yeah
[37:47] it's interesting that
[37:49] uh Nostra had last years like uh almost
[37:53] everybody talked about it it kind of
[37:56] flattened now at least I see it now less
[37:59] and less uh talked about um and I always
[38:03] ask every guest before I end the podcast
[38:05] or where can people find you where can
[38:06] people ask you questions and I think
[38:09] yeah I don't know every every 20th guest
[38:11] or every 30th guest or something like
[38:13] that is saying oh I'm also Nostra most
[38:16] say Twitter uh like I think probably 95%
[38:20] of of guest say Twitter where they ask
[38:23] questions some also have YouTube some
[38:25] have other socials um is is is
[38:29] Nostra um the future still the future of
[38:32] social media and and this social graph
[38:34] and social layer of our society uh or is
[38:38] this this uh Network effect of this big
[38:41] social media companies just too hard to
[38:44] crack no I mean the look The the network
[38:46] effect of the big social media companies
[38:48] is going to be difficult to crack and
[38:49] it's going to take time for me the way
[38:51] to think about nost is it's not the
[38:53] future of social networks it's the
[38:54] future of the internet where all
[38:57] internet applications are influenced by
[39:00] your social graph so all internet
[39:02] applications whether it's like an a book
[39:05] store like Amazon where the like imagine
[39:08] going to a book and when you read the
[39:11] reviews the reviews that you see on the
[39:13] top come from the people that you follow
[39:17] or the people who you follow follow so
[39:19] that way there's like a relevance to the
[39:21] thing imagine so one of the features on
[39:23] Sat lantis
[39:25] is you go to a merchant and on the
[39:28] merchant page not only can the merchant
[39:29] have a profile so they can build an
[39:32] audience like they can on Instagram but
[39:34] they have their information like they
[39:35] have on Google and they have their
[39:37] reviews and let's say I come to I don't
[39:40] know which part of uh Austria or Germany
[39:42] you're in but let's say I go to Munich
[39:44] and you live in Munich and I go to a
[39:46] restaurant you've reviewed this
[39:48] restaurant I'll see your review at the
[39:50] top which means to me now because I
[39:52] follow you there's a higher chance that
[39:54] you and I like similar things so number
[39:57] one I know it's real number two it's
[39:58] more relevant to me so you you can start
[40:02] to think that the social graph basically
[40:05] acting as a layer of the internet will
[40:09] change the way all applications on top
[40:12] operate so it's very early days like I
[40:14] would say where in the 1989 or 1990 of
[40:19] Noster right so the internet was still
[40:21] young at that point it was still early
[40:22] days in the next decade Noster is going
[40:25] to change the foundation upon which
[40:28] under underneath which sorry the uh the
[40:31] rest of the applications are built so I
[40:34] think it's definitely the future like I
[40:35] I got a little bit bearish as well
[40:37] because I went down the AI rabbit hole
[40:38] and I was like less interested in the
[40:39] nosta stuff like over 2023 I was like
[40:41] yeah whatever no worries but as we
[40:44] started going down this Rabbit Hole of
[40:46] how can we build a
[40:48] dynamic travel application a dynamic
[40:51] Community application man Noster is Head
[40:54] and Shoulders above all the other um
[40:58] uh all the other toolkits that will
[41:00] enable something like this to be built
[41:02] so yeah man I I look forward to to
[41:05] seeing how this is going to grow but I'm
[41:06] ultra Ultra bullish and in fact I I
[41:09] believe we get Mass Noster adoption long
[41:11] before we get Mass Bitcoin adoption it's
[41:13] like um the thing that come now on my
[41:16] head is uh when I go and search for like
[41:20] new guests or I see some replies and I
[41:23] want to figure out if if I want to have
[41:25] them on my podcast um I just click on
[41:28] this profile and the biggest signal I
[41:30] get is how many people that I follow
[41:34] follow this person totally yeah and and
[41:36] that's kind of what you described what
[41:39] if we can have this social graph that we
[41:41] have only the T the ecosystem all over
[41:44] the uh internet and we can see
[41:47] everywhere this social graph and and
[41:49] nostr is kind of not the social network
[41:51] it's like the the social graph that we
[41:52] can take around theet and it is also
[41:55] connecting with Twitter is also Conn
[41:57] with other applications uh that would be
[41:59] extremely cool like I would love that
[42:03] because now when someone sends me oh uh
[42:06] you should have this him on the podcast
[42:08] I'm like what's his Twitter handle like
[42:10] this is my biggest signal because there
[42:12] I just have the biggest Network and I
[42:14] know the most people and this is like
[42:16] kind of my thing where I grew up with uh
[42:19] if he is only uh on LinkedIn I I have no
[42:23] clue about like I have to really search
[42:25] the Articles everything what he's doing
[42:27] is writing um or when he's not on social
[42:30] media like it's it's it's even even
[42:32] harder then but uh this kind of signal
[42:36] around the world that around the
[42:37] internet that would be uh amazing to
[42:40] have like that's an really cool idea and
[42:42] and really cool uh thing to do and
[42:44] you're saying this is faster than than
[42:47] Bitcoin adoption so you imagine that
[42:49] being reality in like five 10 years yeah
[42:51] for sure I think it's way faster I think
[42:54] this idea of a portable social graph
[42:56] there's like really explicit utility uh
[42:59] on that bitcoin's fighting a bigger War
[43:01] you know that's the thing bitcoin's
[43:02] fighting the central banks the entire
[43:04] sta structure it's fighting the the
[43:07] hedge funds Wall Street it's fighting
[43:09] governments like Bitcoin has a massive
[43:11] war and it's got to basically the the
[43:14] opportunity cost of going on the wrong
[43:16] social network is much lower for a
[43:19] person than the opportunity cost of
[43:21] getting the wrong money right like you
[43:23] get the wrong money and you lose
[43:25] everything you're right if you
[43:27] got on the wrong social network and you
[43:29] lost your followers oh well you know
[43:30] it's a pain in the ass but you go to the
[43:32] next social network it's not the end of
[43:33] the world so Bitcoin has like it's much
[43:36] more uh the stakes are way higher with
[43:39] Bitcoin and it's going to take a lot
[43:40] more change and that's why I believe
[43:41] Bitcoin is going to take multiple
[43:42] generations to occur whereas Noster is
[43:46] squarely in the the technical realm and
[43:50] the technical realm is much more
[43:53] malleable than the socio e EIC political
[43:58] realm like that takes that takes time to
[44:01] evolve and that's where Bitcoin lives
[44:02] Bitcoin lives kind of at the Nexus of
[44:05] society technology economics and
[44:07] politics Bitcoin lives in that space
[44:10] Noster lives squarely inside technology
[44:12] there's there's obviously a little bit
[44:14] of like politics philosophy all that
[44:16] sort of around it but fundamentally
[44:18] Nostra is a new Tex de and sure Noster
[44:21] might be fighting with Facebook and
[44:23] Twitter and all of that sort of stuff
[44:25] but it is so fundamentally uh better and
[44:28] at some point my prediction is that Elon
[44:30] will probably end up putting Twitter on
[44:32] Noster anyway uh as Noster becomes more
[44:35] of a fundamental layer of the internet
[44:39] and you know that that might take five
[44:41] or 10 years but it's going to
[44:43] happen and also with with uh social
[44:46] networks that's just no real opportunity
[44:49] cost like as you mentioned um I can just
[44:51] download another social media app and it
[44:54] costs me almost nothing if I want to put
[44:56] like 10% out of Bitcoin into a new
[44:59] monetary system this might uh might
[45:04] demolish this 10% that I put out of
[45:06] Bitcoin and lose and I lose opportunity
[45:08] cost so like money is is way harder to
[45:10] Knack it's a way harder Network effect
[45:13] but it's also really R and when we talk
[45:15] about Bitcoin adoption do you think
[45:18] um uh that we kind of already have one
[45:21] or like what are the battles that that
[45:23] Bitcoin has still has to to fight and
[45:26] what are the battles that Bitcoin still
[45:28] needs to to tackle to to get to this
[45:31] Mass adoption or is it just time uh in
[45:34] it's time man yeah it's time I mean
[45:35] we're going to fight all sorts of stupid
[45:37] battles along the way you know now
[45:38] there's like this whole ordinals versus
[45:41] monetary maximalists you know you've got
[45:43] even in fighting like I saw now that
[45:46] there's like Bruce Fenton fighting with
[45:48] Jack dorsy or something like that like
[45:50] so so this like me you know bit
[45:53] Bitcoin is if there's one thing they're
[45:54] good at is like arguing and just argue
[45:56] like if if they get a little bit too
[45:58] bored with something and things are like
[46:00] you know something's not happening
[46:01] they'll just yell at each other about
[46:03] whatever is the new thing these days so
[46:05] you know I I guess it keeps keeps
[46:07] everyone sharp um for me personally I've
[46:10] kind of moved away from a lot of the
[46:12] infighting I'm just sort of done with it
[46:14] I've got too many things to build too
[46:15] many things to write too many things to
[46:17] say too many things to do but I think
[46:21] the the battles are going to continue
[46:23] there's going to be battles about
[46:24] custody there's going to be battles to
[46:25] do with privacy there's going to be
[46:27] battles to do like you know we've seen
[46:28] what's happened with coin join and all
[46:29] that sort of stuff recently there's
[46:30] going to be battles with I'm sure at
[46:33] some point as the government gets more
[46:35] desperate and maybe not in the this
[46:37] decade maybe next decade they try and do
[46:39] a 6102 there's going to be battles with
[46:42] like the black rocks with the world so
[46:43] it's
[46:44] like yeah like sometimes I wonder it's
[46:47] like you know the Bitcoin space is like
[46:48] a constant War you know what I mean like
[46:50] it's just like a you you win one fight
[46:54] you look up and you're like yes you're
[46:56] like oh there's something else
[46:57] coming so it's uh yeah the battles will
[47:02] continue that's all I it's a it's really
[47:04] interesting also when you mentioned like
[47:06] it's there there's also inside of of
[47:09] Bitcoin really F fights about stuff and
[47:12] then there is fights coming from the
[47:14] outside um sometimes I feel like Bitcoin
[47:18] uh is too much of a ideology too much of
[47:22] a religion sometimes people um put it
[47:26] too much
[47:27] do you also feel like that that Bitcoin
[47:29] is too much of a too much of a religion
[47:32] sometimes I mean I I go back and forth
[47:34] on this topic I'm generally of the
[47:36] opinion that the religious element of
[47:37] Bitcoin is quite important because these
[47:40] kind of movements have to be religious
[47:42] in nature like Christianity won because
[47:44] there was this fervent rabid group of
[47:47] people who would literally give their
[47:49] lives for this idea of Christianity they
[47:53] stared themselves They Crucified
[47:56] themselves they maed themselves all this
[47:59] sort of stuff and the Romans were like
[48:00]  what what's going on with these
[48:02] people they're insane uh we
[48:04] can't kill them we can't like not kill
[48:07] them like no matter what we do they are
[48:10] tied to this ideology and over time that
[48:13] like extreme commitment to an idea made
[48:17] Christianity the the basically the the
[48:21] standard for Europe right so I think
[48:25] Bitcoin in many ways is going to go
[48:26] through something similar it's it can't
[48:28] be just a technological movement it
[48:30] can't be just an economic movement like
[48:32] those things are important it's almost
[48:33] like in sales they say that you need to
[48:36] you need to have the emotional close
[48:39] first and then you do The Logical close
[48:42] because people don't buy based on what
[48:45] they think people buy based on what they
[48:46] feel right so when you're selling
[48:48] somebody you make them want the thing by
[48:51] focusing on the benefits and then to
[48:54] avoid buyer remorse you reinforce the
[48:56] features which is logical and then
[48:59] people walk away happy with the purchase
[49:01] right if you don't do the logical piece
[49:03] then people feel regret and they're like
[49:06] oh I just did it because I was uh
[49:09] con convinced into doing it I was like I
[49:11] was emotional I was in the in the wrong
[49:12] place so with Bitcoin it's actually got
[49:14] the emotional bit that's the religion
[49:17] and it's got the logical clo because you
[49:19] can't fault Bitcoin it's economically
[49:21] sound it's philosophically sound it's
[49:22] architecturally sound it's technically
[49:24] sound and all that sort of stuff but the
[49:26] the the the religious idea of a new
[49:28] monetary standard that's going to fix
[49:30] the world and all this sort of stuff as
[49:31] much as it's probably exaggerated people
[49:35] out of their minds in many ways
[49:36] like comparing it to bitcoin is melium
[49:38] Bitcoin is mushrooms Bitcoin is
[49:40] yoga and all this other weird that
[49:42] people compare it to um I think that's
[49:45] exaggerated but at the same time I
[49:47] believe it's necessary because that what
[49:49] that's what creates a movement and
[49:52] that's what's necessary for us to stick
[49:55] through this across multiple Generations
[49:58] because there's no way we win like we're
[49:59] not going to win in 10 years or 20 years
[50:01] we're going to win in 100 years and for
[50:03] something to last 100 years it needs to
[50:05] be
[50:06] religious I love that a lot uh that's a
[50:10] great explanation um we have before our
[50:13] end routine always one question that is
[50:14] for every guest the same question um
[50:17] it's my aim to contribute to bitcoin
[50:21] something other than Bitcoin um and the
[50:24] question for you is what can we learn
[50:26] from you besides
[50:28] Bitcoin well
[50:32] hopefully people can learn something out
[50:34] of the bashid of Bitcoin in terms of
[50:37] virtue in terms of making themselves
[50:40] better in terms of this concept of
[50:43] excellence in terms of responsibility
[50:46] being the pathway to Freedom we can't be
[50:49] Freedom accx unless we actually have to
[50:51] be a responsibility maximalist freedom
[50:52] is a outcome sorry freedom is Downstream
[50:55] of responsibility
[50:57] so I hope people can learn to be better
[51:00] stronger more vital more ascendant human
[51:02] beings and I hope that that's what the
[51:05] book The Bido of Bitcoin delivers and
[51:08] you know maybe hopefully they can also
[51:09] learn something about Nostra so I know
[51:11] that's two things but hope that's useful
[51:14] two things are better than one usually
[51:17] sometimes um our intro team is uh where
[51:20] the previous guest is asking a question
[51:21] for the next guest without knowing who
[51:23] the next guest actually is um and the
[51:25] question from the previous gu is if you
[51:27] could sit down with anyone to chat about
[51:30] Bitcoin who would it be and why is there
[51:32] a period of time or no uh I would say
[51:36] right now but there's nothing
[51:38] specific uh I I would it's it's between
[51:41] like Steve Jobs Nicola Tesla or
[51:44] Alexander the Great um I feel like yeah
[51:46] may maybe the Alexander the Great
[51:48] context is a little bit off because he
[51:50] was obviously two and a half thousand
[51:52] years ago um Steve Jobs probably most
[51:56] contextually applicable and obviously
[51:59] Nicola Tesla relevant still to some
[52:02] degree and maybe he could have
[52:03] conceptualized it but yeah one one of
[52:05] those three so I don't have a definitive
[52:07] answer but maybe all three there there
[52:11] is uh have not written um read too much
[52:15] about it but I've written a thread uh
[52:18] where someone was claiming oh Steve chop
[52:21] has to be had to be satos Nakamoto I
[52:24] don't know if you heard about that it's
[52:26] not I didn't but that would be
[52:28] interesting that would be very
[52:30] interesting so especially in that
[52:31] context it would be extremely uh cool to
[52:34] sit down with Steve Jobs perfect then uh
[52:37] thank you Alexander for for being on um
[52:39] before I let you go where can people
[52:41] find you where can people find uh the
[52:43] things that you produce for sure so
[52:46] let's start with Noster so if you just
[52:47] type in swety my surname I should come
[52:50] up uh I'm sure there's Bots and scammers
[52:53] all over Nostra so just look for the one
[52:54] that has like 13 14,000
[52:57] followers uh on Twitter and Instagram
[53:00] I'm under swety writes so like writing
[53:03] wri tees and on there I on Twitter I'm a
[53:08] little bit more sporadic on Instagram
[53:10] I've just reactivated my account and I'm
[53:12] trying to be a little bit more regular
[53:14] with posts and I'm generally just
[53:16] posting about my uh about the book and
[53:20] then for anyone who's interested based
[53:22] on the discussion we had about grabbing
[53:24] the book it's on pre-sale now you get it
[53:26] at a
[53:28] discount at uh Bidoof bitcoin.com so you
[53:32] can get some free chapters and it's not
