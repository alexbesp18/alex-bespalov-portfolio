[00:00] oh my God maximalism actually is
[00:02] minimalism because it's just focusing on
[00:05] the best it's Bitcoin that's
[00:06] decentralized why don't you accept
[00:08] Bitcoin for taxes it's going to be a
[00:11] very huge marketing move and I saw a
[00:14] news publish on the newspaper we're
[00:17] going to accept Bitcoin for taxes it's
[00:19] great to live in a city where you can
[00:20] actually spend your Bitcoin the
[00:22] government they are really confused in a
[00:24] Bitcoin standard it's more time for the
[00:26] things that make life
[00:28] beautiful uh usually um research about
[00:31] my guests I will look through the
[00:33] Twitter feeds I see if there's YouTube
[00:35] videos on there if there's interviews on
[00:37] there I saw that like in Bitcoin Prague
[00:39] you were on stage you were on different
[00:42] other stages I think in Amsterdam you
[00:43] also were on stage yeah yeah and you
[00:46] talked on the topic about Bitcoin
[00:48] maximalism and I never covered on my
[00:51] Bitcoin only podcast the topic about
[00:53] Bitcoin maximalism which is uh really
[00:55] weird uh and that's why I wanted to just
[00:58] start off with the question that you
[01:00] sure Bitcoin maximalism is actually
[01:03] minimalism like first of all like what
[01:05] is for you Bitcoin maximalism and why is
[01:07] it minimalism for you sure wow a very
[01:11] nice question because I I think about
[01:13] this topics a lot and when they asked me
[01:18] to talk about Bitcoin maximalism um I
[01:21] thought actually it's the contrary so so
[01:25] I got to research a little bit and I was
[01:27] like oh my God maximalism actually is
[01:31] minimalism because it's just focusing on
[01:34] the best on one stuff and don't care
[01:37] about anything else just like I mean if
[01:41] you look at some topics from minimalism
[01:43] just like the cluttering your stuff the
[01:46] cluttering is not about throwing away
[01:49] necessarily it's just something you do
[01:52] to get uh to the best to get uh to focus
[01:56] on the stuff that really matters for you
[01:58] and once you start a clutter you
[02:00] declutter your time your relationship
[02:03] you declutter your goals you declutter
[02:07] everything and you remain just like with
[02:11] the best and so when you start with
[02:13] Bitcoin you declutter every other
[02:16] project that seem just like Bitcoin but
[02:18] it's not Bitcoin and in the end the only
[02:22] one that it's really really
[02:24] decentralized censorship resistant which
[02:27] is all the characteristic by design
[02:30] doesn't have a a point of
[02:33] failure and and all the characteristic
[02:37] of Bitcoin actually it's the only one
[02:39] that can do that and has done that since
[02:43] the conception of Bitcoin and so you can
[02:46] focus your energy your
[02:48] investment uh the value everything on
[02:51] bitcoin only so it's super super easy
[02:54] empowering like I
[02:56] mean it's very funny because uh uh um
[03:00] they invited me to talk about this topic
[03:03] it happens uh from time to time to me
[03:06] but when you think about of some
[03:08] somebody which is a very toxic
[03:11] maximalist bitcoiner you don't expect
[03:14] somebody as
[03:15] me but the reason why this happening is
[03:19] because in the past we've been around
[03:22] for some years and so we fought uh the
[03:26] Bitcoin wor we fought very I wouldn't
[03:29] say by ly but very strongly for Bitcoin
[03:33] as it is now we have done everything in
[03:35] our power and I use the plural because
[03:38] we were a community in Milan because I
[03:40] worked a lot with jao and this so during
[03:44] those years uh it was very important to
[03:47] be not only minimalist but also very
[03:51] strong and very strict in our opinion
[03:54] because uh I wouldn't say that our
[03:57] opinion matter that much for Bitcoin but
[04:00] in the end in a way yes we all as a
[04:04] community influence each other to take
[04:06] some position to take some strong
[04:09] decision to help Bitcoin during the
[04:11] block size Wars and no 2x movement some
[04:16] month later and so I have been kind of
[04:21] kind of strong I usually I am a very
[04:23] soft person if you know me uh Al
[04:26] everything is soft about me my color and
[04:29] my way of communic communicating but in
[04:31] that regard uh we everybody had to be
[04:35] really strong in that it was too
[04:37] important for us and when you care about
[04:40] something uh you cannot be soft and so
[04:43] the reason this is the reason why I
[04:45] think that Bitcoin maximalist can uh can
[04:49] be also something important for a normal
[04:52] penil that doesn't look like a shadowy
[04:54] coder or just like uh I mean you think
[04:58] just like a Bitcoin maximalist just like
[05:00] a person that uh uh is just eat only
[05:04] meat h of course uh do strength training
[05:08] all time is very masculine and all the
[05:11] things connected to that well I can
[05:14] agree with some I'm definitely not that
[05:17] masculine right I have so for example
[05:21] that definition is very far away from me
[05:24] and from what I say from what I am I can
[05:27] have some point in common but it's not
[05:29] about that it's not about eating meat I
[05:32] eat meat I love meat I have been
[05:34] carnivore for years so uh that's but
[05:38] that's not the point the point when you
[05:40] reduce it it's about being super
[05:43] minimalist in uh in the regard of
[05:45] Bitcoin and that's the thing we all
[05:47] share and that's only uh the only thing
[05:50] we we care about as Bitcoin maximalist
[05:54] right absolutely it's it's and it's for
[05:56] me so interesting because it comes down
[05:58] to as you said minimalism and focus for
[06:01] example uh because when you have all
[06:03] especially for new and this is why I'm
[06:05] so bullish about speaking only about
[06:09] Bitcoin and making it clear to newcomers
[06:11] that it's Bitcoin that's decentralized
[06:13] it's Bitcoin that does uh all the crazy
[06:17] stuff and all the other altcoins or the
[06:20] shitcoin AR uh is trying to mimic what
[06:23] Bitcoin is doing to cash in on the trend
[06:27] but they not even decentralized like the
[06:29] first thing they want to solve
[06:31] decentralization they don't have it and
[06:33] this is what uh I'm I'm I'm really
[06:36] trying to get it across and uh like I
[06:39] get comments all the time like oh why
[06:42] don't you talk about this coin or can
[06:44] you maybe invite this person and then I
[06:46] look at their profile I'm like oh it's a
[06:48]  coiner and I'm like I'm so sorry
[06:51] and I'm trying to be always really kind
[06:53] like I I'm I'm it my heart a very kind
[06:56] person I'm not I'm not the shut up and
[06:59] go away person I'm like oh I'm so sorry
[07:01] I'm having a Bitcoin only channel so I
[07:04] will only talk about Bitcoin like I'm
[07:05] really usually really kind and also kind
[07:08] of soft uh I would describe myself uh
[07:11] but in terms of Bitcoin I'm like no it's
[07:14] it's Bitcoin only like not even ethereum
[07:17] it's not even closely to decentralized
[07:19] as it should be uh yeah so but you also
[07:23] yeah yeah I know and that's uh I think
[07:26] uh comes to the second Point as point I
[07:28] strongly believe it just being a Bitcoin
[07:32] maximalist is also about empathy empathy
[07:36] on the people around you because you
[07:38] don't want that other people get scammed
[07:41] but I I don't mean only scammed by
[07:44] investing in something that doesn't have
[07:46] any value but also scam it about
[07:48] spending their time on these stupid
[07:51] projects it it just doesn't make any
[07:54] sense i'me I'm trying to prevent you uh
[07:59] to to get lost in this project because
[08:02] uh otherwise you're going to waste your
[08:04] time you're going to waste your energy
[08:06] and in the end your value and that's not
[08:09] a good scenario but the worst scenario
[08:12] of course is it it is you're going to be
[08:14] SC scammed we know so many people they
[08:18] lost so much money in this project and
[08:22] also they they they also get lost and
[08:26] lost their reputation following those
[08:28] projects and those tokens project Ico
[08:33] whatever I mean I have seen so many
[08:36] tragic uh things to these people and I
[08:39] don't want for other people to endorse
[08:42] this type of behavior so in the end it's
[08:45] trying to be very empathetic to the
[08:48] newcomers I think there are great ways
[08:50] to communicate that in an empathetic
[08:53] soft way very very polite way but in the
[08:56] end the message should be clear many
[08:59] people
[09:00] mean h i have done many jobs in my life
[09:03] one of my job is um to be a vocal coach
[09:06] so when I teach uh I am I am a coach so
[09:09] I teach people to sing and I have to
[09:12] correct mistakes all the time and many
[09:15] of my students actually told me oh you
[09:18] are very nice to me you never say that
[09:21] I'm wrong no I we record the lessons
[09:25] come back I always say the true but I I
[09:28] try to say that in a way that you can
[09:30] metabolize and you can accept that but I
[09:33] W I will never say something that I
[09:35] don't believe I will never say that not
[09:38] was correct when it was wrong so there
[09:40] is a way to convey strong strong stuff
[09:45] in a nice way right and still the
[09:48] intention is to be nice with these
[09:51] people I mean we cannot prevent them to
[09:54] do all the mistakes but we can do our
[09:56] best to to try to
[10:00] to make them to look at the real stuff
[10:02] right also because we have seen so many
[10:04] people also because personally many of
[10:06] us have done the mistakes by ourselves
[10:10] so we strongly believe we strongly want
[10:13] for them not to do the the same right so
[10:16] that's our um very strong
[10:19] why I I think I get now why people are
[10:23] are calling you the godm of Italy's uh
[10:26] Bitcoin
[10:28] community
[10:30] what did this original like how did this
[10:32] came to be I even I usually before I
[10:35] research about a guest I even put it in
[10:37] chat gbt and I put your name in chat gbt
[10:42] and asked you uh I think I put like
[10:44] something like oh I'm interviewing uh
[10:47] this person and she is in Italy and then
[10:50] it actually came up like in the end of
[10:53] like she's known as the Godmother of
[10:54] Italy's
[10:56] Community call me like that so it's
[11:00] because of a journalist Leen and she
[11:03] wrote an article on me probably was
[11:06] 2017 and that was the title of the
[11:09] article and I love that so much because
[11:12] it's it was so true because at that time
[11:15] my job was to create a community in
[11:17] Milan but the majority of my work
[11:20] actually was trying to get all the best
[11:23] expert in the Bitcoin space at that time
[11:26] to our Hub a laboratory in Millen to get
[11:29] them to work together and to work for us
[11:33] to get the best information to connect
[11:35] the best project to get the best so you
[11:37] have to imagine that during 2017 there
[11:40] weren't many places in the world uh just
[11:43] like physical places in the um and also
[11:47] I mean uh maximalist place where people
[11:51] were weren't trying to scam you but we
[11:53] were trying to anounce the people so uh
[11:57] I I took a care of this EXP ERT just
[11:59] like the best way that I could so I was
[12:02] following then in their project in every
[12:06] single step that I could so I felt that
[12:10] was a very nice definition of what I was
[12:13] doing protecting them trying to to get
[12:16] the best from them to get the best
[12:18] opportunities because they they were
[12:20] amazing in their project so we were
[12:22] trying to connect them with the money
[12:25] and the reality of the of the business
[12:28] words connecting those two words
[12:30] together because they didn't have the
[12:31] knowledge they had the knowledge so we
[12:34] were a sort of a proxy and also a proxy
[12:36] between all of these project because we
[12:38] were like oh my God you don't have to
[12:40] reinvent the wheel there's somebody else
[12:43] working on that if you put everything
[12:45] together oh that's interesting you can
[12:47] do something without all these effort
[12:50] right the majority of of times those
[12:53] things kind of happen it kind of work it
[12:55] of course not every single time so
[13:00] I think the definition was very nice and
[13:02] also it was really really Italian as a
[13:04] definition and just like referring to
[13:08] the padrino and was very very very nice
[13:11] so I I decided to keep it uh because I
[13:15] really identify in that and also I
[13:17] identify as someone
[13:20] that I mean I really like all the human
[13:25] right implication and the wise behind
[13:27] Bitcoin but I'm very passionate also
[13:30] about the technology and so for me
[13:33] talking with the Nerds talking with
[13:36] people that really build Bitcoin code
[13:39] and all the application and the tools to
[13:42] me is one of the best thing in the world
[13:44] I can listen to them I can learn from
[13:48] them all the time and when you connect
[13:51] the two things together technology and
[13:55] freedom boom that's Bitcoin right but
[13:59] this is also about other projects just
[14:01] like Noster and other projects just like
[14:04] kit and everything that the guys are
[14:07] doing there so I think that's one of the
[14:11] thing that I love the most in my
[14:14] life what do you see as the like the
[14:17] most exciting uh tools like the most
[14:20] exciting things going on in the Bitcoin
[14:21] Community outside of like just having
[14:24] Bitcoin like there as you mentioned
[14:26] there's Nostra there are so many nice
[14:28] applications there's lightning then
[14:30] there are like different Layer Two
[14:31] Solutions with fent liquid like there's
[14:34] so much going on what's yeah there's so
[14:37] much going on but
[14:39] still I would say that right now I know
[14:43] I don't want to enter in this but we are
[14:46] very close to sort of a horific of the
[14:50] Cod so right now uh this is not as
[14:54] important as used to be and the tools is
[14:57] also the first level of the tools are
[15:01] becoming very very solid too they still
[15:04] lack um a lot of user interface features
[15:09] to to reach all the people around so I
[15:13] think we can start uh thinking on
[15:16] something else and what I mean about
[15:19] that I I think that um decentralize
[15:24] everything is a very good and nice quote
[15:28] to say so
[15:29] we have to enter in a sort of uh um I
[15:34] mean in the past we have been very
[15:35] focused on the implication also and
[15:39] companies about uh business finance or
[15:43] whatever but I feel that we should
[15:47] arrive with the centralization
[15:49] or censorship resist and peer-to-peer
[15:52] qualities also on U uh just like
[15:56] ordinary tools that we use all the time
[15:58] we're experimenting on Noster we know
[16:00] that Noster has um many many flows and
[16:04] that's the reality but still I think
[16:07] that it's super cool to experiment to
[16:10] understand what the community really use
[16:12] and want so I'm really excited on see uh
[16:16] everything that is going on there uh
[16:18] especially I mean zaps are incredible
[16:22] zaps are really really incredible we
[16:24] have try to overcome uh that part we
[16:29] have never been able to do that because
[16:31] every time we did the tips on platforms
[16:34] the platform are centralized they are
[16:36] controlled and so even if Noster as
[16:39] problem can be and become centralized in
[16:43] the future uh not so far away still
[16:47] right now we could do free stuff without
[16:49] being stopped I have seen so many
[16:52] companies and people trying to do tips
[16:54] on uh on Twitter X whatever but it
[16:58] couldn't because they have been stopped
[17:00] by the platform itself so right now we
[17:03] have a toy just like Noster to
[17:07] experiment without being stopped okay so
[17:10] also I'm very excited on all the blog uh
[17:15] the the the news everything you can do
[17:17] from there and also all the integration
[17:20] so
[17:21] personally I'm working on that on trying
[17:24] to understand how we can Bridge together
[17:28] other similar project with a Noster and
[17:32] between and all this project together I
[17:34] can tell too much but I'm really excited
[17:37] because it just like as I told you
[17:40] before I am I see that people are in
[17:44] this phase of they don't notice but they
[17:47] are re kind of Reinventing the will
[17:49] while they should actually put all the
[17:53] effort together and from time to time
[17:55] they are so focused on their stuff they
[17:57] don't see the big picture so somebody
[18:00] just somebody that is not that competent
[18:03] but coming from be um coming from
[18:06] outside can see the big picture and say
[18:09] Hey guys you're working on the St same
[18:11] stuff or you can implement the same
[18:13] things and have you noticed that and so
[18:19] I think that's really interesting so
[18:21] many many many many people not not so
[18:24] many actually some people are working on
[18:26] amazing stuff but Haven haven't noticed
[18:29] yet that uh they can put all the effort
[18:32] together and so this is what I'm looking
[18:34] to uh to see in the next um in the next
[18:37] month year hopefully I mean everything
[18:40] is going so fast that probably during
[18:42] the next weeks which is amazing right
[18:45] yeah it's amazing how fast this goes and
[18:48] also like in Nostra there's like this
[18:50] concept of value for value and this is
[18:53] uh quite new and amazing for me like
[18:55] this podcast is also on Fountain it's on
[18:57] YouTube it's all the platforms and uh I
[19:00] get tips just directly to the wallet uh
[19:03] when you see on on Nostra on on damos
[19:07] wherever you are then entering it uh my
[19:11] address and you can directly send it to
[19:12] me and there's like no fee to it uh but
[19:15] then there is a fountain I think there's
[19:18] a small feed to it but most of it
[19:20] actually comes through uh and I'm
[19:23] appreciating everyone that is like
[19:24] streaming there like tipping there and
[19:26] it's really really cool and then there's
[19:28] YouTube
[19:29] YouTube uh there are channel members uh
[19:32] so like they paying like I think have
[19:34] one thing where like1 199 per month and
[19:36] it's like just a comment priority I just
[19:39] activated and I was not expecting
[19:41] anybody to join but people actually join
[19:44] and I was like Wow interesting thank you
[19:47] and then there's also super thanks like
[19:50] people are on YouTube giving tips on it
[19:53] and the most like the biggest difference
[19:55] is like the cut that the platforms take
[19:58] on mountain and all the others like
[20:00] really small cut like most of it comes
[20:02] directly to me like to the person that
[20:05] the sender send it but YouTube takes on
[20:07] the super FS over 50% of the cut wow
[20:12] it's like someone gave me uh I think 10
[20:15] uh Swiss frank actually is someone from
[20:17] Swiss and on my side my side was like
[20:21] 475 EUR came through so that tells you a
[20:24] lot uh and and I think value for value
[20:27] on on on
[20:29] fountain on Nostra on whatever platform
[20:31] it will be really good for how do you
[20:33] see value for value and even like value
[20:35] for Value against uh sponsorships
[20:37] against advertisements what do you see
[20:39] uh coming there yeah I I just want to
[20:42] add you that uh when I on YouTube
[20:46] personally I really love when the ALB
[20:49] application um is on so I see uh the I
[20:53] think is a B I don't know the B is
[20:56] turning just like blue and just like oh
[20:59] my God I can tip directly through that
[21:02] through the extension so uh this is
[21:04] amazing YouTube is not going to get
[21:07] anything I can I can give something
[21:09] directly to the the creators so I really
[21:12] love love what they are doing at Alby
[21:14] because it's so easy and uh it's
[21:17] so yeah yeah it just like I I'm
[21:20] surprised because many people they want
[21:23] to donate but they don't have the
[21:24] facility to do that they don't have the
[21:27] I mean they are in the moment they want
[21:29] to do that they are not bad people they
[21:32] just forget about it right or it's just
[21:34] too complicated or just want to go with
[21:36] the flow with a podcast with a Content
[21:38] it's just not like the people are are
[21:40] lazy or just like they are not very very
[21:43] nice people it's just like they don't
[21:45] have the tools most of the time right so
[21:48] if we facilitate that we're also
[21:51] bitcoiners are very very generous and so
[21:54] I think coming back to the question that
[21:57] value for value is incredible also for
[22:00] non bitcoiners is the model is just how
[22:04] it should be you do something I give you
[22:06] something in return it's just like in
[22:09] the past it was just normal also if you
[22:11] go uh in a street and you hear somebody
[22:16] uh just play music and you think it's
[22:18] something valuable and you like that
[22:20] moment and you have some some cash with
[22:23] you so you just tip the guy that is
[22:27] playing the guitar because you like it
[22:29] it's so easy as a concept you hear
[22:32] something you like you tip immediately
[22:35] proportionally on the value you think
[22:38] that uh happening there right it's just
[22:41] between me and you it's a peerto peer
[22:45] something we think that is something
[22:48] about the the future it is because about
[22:51] the tools are digital tools of the
[22:53] future but the reality is that it has
[22:57] been the natural way that we always add
[23:00] as human beings to interact with each
[23:02] other and to help each other and if I
[23:05] don't think you are giving me value if
[23:07] you bother me I'm going away and I don't
[23:10] tip you so so easy right but if you have
[23:14] a platform between me and you things
[23:17] complicated of course platform are not
[23:19] evil per se it is a good thing
[23:21] centralization is not always a bad thing
[23:24] because it's very efficient to have
[23:26] somebody the network effect can happen
[23:29] because of platforms right on YouTube
[23:32] there you get so many people listening
[23:34] to your to your job you couldn't get in
[23:37] other
[23:38] spaces but also in that I mean there are
[23:42] exception because uh if you are with
[23:44] your Niche probably you're going to get
[23:48] directly to your audience and not all
[23:50] the people that you can get on on a
[23:53] platform just like YouTube even if the
[23:55] algorithm should prevent that but still
[23:58] it's something manipulated in for them
[24:02] not for you and directly to the Creator
[24:05] so and also it feel just like that I
[24:07] mean it just feel very
[24:10] impersonal uh given something uh just
[24:13] like a sponsorship or giving something
[24:15] just like a donation while doing that
[24:18] immediately feel just like so personal
[24:21] you feel more involved with that Creator
[24:24] you feel that you're doing something
[24:26] good uh not only for the Creator but for
[24:28] the contents you are helping you are
[24:32] deciding so it's very rewarding one
[24:35] thing that I noticed personally it's
[24:36] just like it's very addictive when you
[24:39] start giving zaps and giving small tips
[24:43] it's just like you want to do more and
[24:46] more and more you get bothered if you
[24:48] don't find that on other platform it
[24:51] just feels so wrong it it happened to me
[24:54] so fast actually after some days or some
[24:57] weeks was zapping I was like oh my God I
[25:01] want to to give some SS to this Creator
[25:05] and I can't I like is not enough a
[25:08] direct donation too much I don't have
[25:11] time I don't want to and also they don't
[25:14] understand for what it is the donation
[25:17] for they cannot improve their quality
[25:20] because if a if you have done especially
[25:24] good
[25:25] jobs uh the feedbacks you can get from
[25:29] like from saving the content yes they
[25:32] are not that important because I prob I
[25:35] have another project on Instagram I talk
[25:37] about another topic which is poly mathy
[25:41] and so I tend to get some feedback
[25:44] feedbacks from that but my community uh
[25:48] actually many people are writing me just
[25:50] like I love your content and I'm just
[25:52] like you never liked any single content
[25:55] but they are true fan and they don't
[25:58] demonstrate that right and so I cannot
[26:01] grow my quality I cannot uh really
[26:05] really um have serious feedback but when
[26:08] you have some value some strong value
[26:10] just like SATs I know for certain they
[26:13] are giving me value exactly for that
[26:15] content in that moment and so we can
[26:17] grow together and also they can get
[26:20] amazing and more quality contents over
[26:24] time it's a winwin for everyone so do
[26:28] you think that the platforms like
[26:30] Fountain versus YouTube Nostra versus
[26:32] like Twitter X and all all all this
[26:35] stuff yeah do you think that the network
[26:37] effects that this big platforms like
[26:39] Facebook YouTube uh Twitter have because
[26:43] when we see now Nostra and you see
[26:45] Twitter there's a lot more action right
[26:47] now on Twitter like so many more people
[26:50] uh and it I think it takes a long time
[26:53] to break those Network effects but it's
[26:55] possible do do you see like uh those
[26:57] Network effects effect from the
[26:59] centralized um sides breaking will it
[27:03] live side by side there will be like
[27:05] Twitter there will also be Nostra big
[27:07] like how do you see the future of like
[27:08] social media so I personally think that
[27:14] uh please don't don't blame me but I
[27:17] don't think Noster Will Survive because
[27:20] it has many flows but it is a great
[27:24] place it's given us so many lessons and
[27:28] also I think it's amazing the idea that
[27:30] we can try to break it in every possible
[27:34] way without consequences so I don't want
[27:36] to people to come there I very like the
[27:39] definition of Noster just like a garden
[27:43] uh Noster is a garden and while X is for
[27:46] the fight so we fight with other people
[27:49] we reach other people on X even if we
[27:53] don't like the idea is on a platform
[27:55] where we can be the um uh the platform
[27:59] it it's very difficult
[28:01] term yes yeah every every single moment
[28:05] so it's it's not a great feeling it's
[28:08] nice to be on Noster and to try stuff
[28:11] but possibly it can survive for so long
[28:14] but it's going to give us so many
[28:17] lessons to build something different and
[28:20] I'm not sure if Bitcoin but probably
[28:25] Bitcoin will be the Bitcoin will be
[28:28] there we're going to boost uh just like
[28:31] is just like now a new social media with
[28:34] new probably new terms and uh uh it's
[28:38] not the other way around right so it
[28:41] just like we have two needs and when
[28:44] people is going to use Bitcoin and there
[28:47] is going to be more adoption they are
[28:49] going to to want to use Bitcoin and so
[28:53] probably they are going to converge on a
[28:55] platform that really give them
[28:58] everything they want also using Bitcoin
[29:00] very easily I don't know if it's going
[29:03] to be nster probably not but we have to
[29:05] be really ready with that because uh
[29:08] when it's going to explode I I don't
[29:10] know if it's going to explode actually
[29:12] but at some point there is going to be a
[29:14] moment when we are going to notice it's
[29:17] just not like in the past right for me
[29:19] right now just like oh my God so many
[29:22] people are using Bitcoin so many
[29:23] services coming from the first years I
[29:27] mean right now it just amazing but it's
[29:30] not the reality I mean as long as my uh
[29:35] mom is not going to use Bitcoin uh there
[29:39] is something that is still for for nerds
[29:42] we have those nerds and so when Bitcoin
[29:45] is going to be easier the
[29:48] platform not the platform I mean uh the
[29:51] the decentralized also platform that is
[29:54] going to to help in transac the value
[29:57] easier here so I think that creators are
[30:02] going to um to be very crucially in that
[30:07] because we see many many
[30:10] creators and and they are very bothered
[30:13] by the idea that they cannot receive
[30:16] anything I mean for example uh I create
[30:21] I create contents um on Instagram for
[30:25] example and I didn't get a sing
[30:28] a single s a single scent from there uh
[30:34] actually
[30:35] uh Break Even but only because they
[30:38] invited me uh doing some stuff and uh
[30:42] and that's okay but otherwise I would be
[30:46] pushed to create content and
[30:49] products that I'm not that happy to do
[30:53] only to get some return right so uh I
[30:58] think the majority of creators are tired
[31:01] but also the audience they don't like
[31:04] all these influencer trying to sell you
[31:06] everything uh and lowering the quality
[31:09] because they have to focus on selling
[31:11] stuff they are not so happy to sell they
[31:13] are not good quality so from creators
[31:17] I'm expecting that when they discover
[31:19] something just like value to Value they
[31:22] would be very very happy to use it we
[31:25] are very in early stages but there are
[31:28] plenty of creators in the world and they
[31:31] are very ready to use S yeah definitely
[31:34] and I think at some point there will be
[31:36] Bitcoin as a standard M of exchange as a
[31:39] standard unit of account then uh it will
[31:42] be no-brainer that also on the
[31:45] centralized platforms like Twitter like
[31:47] YouTube there will be a Bitcoin
[31:50] implementation of that uh I don't know
[31:52] if it happens in like 5 years or 50
[31:54] years or 500 years see the the problem
[31:57] is there have been some experimentation
[32:00] but uh you know if the platform decide
[32:03] that you cannot do that because it's
[32:05] valuating the rules you have to stop and
[32:09] so once again you have to be very smart
[32:12] just like I was saying before Al be
[32:14] extension is not going through YouTube
[32:17] but it interacts with YouTube so in the
[32:20] end is a peer peer exchange through an
[32:24] platform so there many people are coming
[32:27] from with new solution so in the future
[32:30] we can have both why not so we can have
[32:33] decentralized places and also we can get
[32:36] very smart in trying to circumvent all
[32:40] these rules because bitcoiners are super
[32:42] smart right they will find solution so
[32:45] they cannot stop us but I think as I was
[32:47] saying before one the the request is
[32:50] coming for creators is going to be
[32:52] really strong because the platform
[32:55] should adapt because they are they live
[32:57] because because of creators is nobody's
[32:59] creating anymore uh I mean nobody's
[33:03] publishing there anymore because they
[33:05] suck they have to adapt to to the new
[33:08] stuff and so probably it's not easy but
[33:12] but I try to do my best to show all the
[33:15] creators the powerful concept Beyond
[33:19] value for value and luckily they it's so
[33:21] easy to get right but of course they
[33:23] have to adapt to use Bitcoin and nowaday
[33:26] it's easier because of lightning and all
[33:28] the tools we have right now still not
[33:31] the trivial so they are like I love this
[33:34] idea of value for Value but at the same
[33:36] time I don't have the
[33:38] time I don't have the time to do all
[33:40] this stuff it seems so
[33:43] complicated and of course there are so
[33:46] many things on the plate right now
[33:47] because also Noster we want to perer our
[33:50] identities we want to use the keys we
[33:53] also want to to look for censorship
[33:56] resistance so
[33:58] it's so much for the normal uh person to
[34:02] get this so I heard about some
[34:04] experiment uh just like trying to to to
[34:07] to call the zap differently not to see
[34:10] there is something about Bitcoin zaps is
[34:12] not about Bitcoin for example but still
[34:16] uh trying
[34:17] to I mean hide there is all this
[34:21] technology there is Bitcoin behind which
[34:24] seems like shitty but it's not bad bad
[34:28] because it's an entry point to some
[34:30] people that need the services and they
[34:32] are ready to learn about that right
[34:34] there are plenty of people for example
[34:37] on Twitch Gamers or whatever I mean I
[34:41] I'm not aware that much because I I
[34:43] don't tend to go there but they are very
[34:46] smart they are young they they are so I
[34:50] think in the end every single entry
[34:52] point for Bitcoin for Zap for value for
[34:56] value is great even if at beginning
[34:59] doesn't sound like that so it's
[35:02] something that I really work on in
[35:04] whatever I do also for Bitcoin I try to
[35:08] delay the barriers so one of the
[35:11] barriers the strongest barrier is about
[35:14] uh technology of course one is about our
[35:17] limitation on money our limitation on
[35:20] what we do we should do another one is
[35:23] language so this is the reason why I
[35:26] have created this very long long list of
[35:28] Italian resources about Bitcoin in
[35:30] Italian because when you delay when you
[35:34] break all these barriers is getting
[35:36] easier easier to to go to the core and
[35:40] since and since we really love Bitcoin
[35:42] and also we not only love Bitcoin but we
[35:45] love to talk about Bitcoin but we also
[35:47] love to bring Bitcoin to other people
[35:51] especially people around us I think it's
[35:53] very important to break these barriers
[35:56] all the time the best we we can 21
[35:58] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[36:02] they teach and preach self- custody this
[36:04] is my go to exchange when someone asks
[36:07] me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from
[36:10] this is the easiest entry for bitcoiners
[36:13] and if you want lower fees Plus at the
[36:16] same time support this podcast use code
[36:19] Robin and click the link in the
[36:21] description yeah definitely and uh you
[36:24] told me uh beforehand that you're also
[36:26] moving now to the as I said uh the
[36:30] Bitcoin heart of uh the the Bitcoin
[36:33] adoption heart of Europe Lugano yes
[36:36] which is amazing uh and first of all
[36:39] congratulations to this step I think
[36:41] it's it's great to live in a city where
[36:42] you can actually spend your Bitcoin also
[36:44] like you can live more and more in the
[36:46] Bitcoin
[36:47] ecosystem um How deep did you have
[36:50] already like integrated Bitcoin in your
[36:52] life and and what do you expect like to
[36:55] see in in in Logano uh in like more
[36:59] closer Bitcoin standard City yeah I have
[37:03] to say that I also I lived uh in El
[37:06] Salvador two month this year one month
[37:10] last year so I was in
[37:13] Elon so yeah just in the middle of a
[37:17] Bitcoin circular economy so I have
[37:20] experienced that before and was pretty
[37:23] amazing one of the thing that I like the
[37:25] most was going to the Bitcoin Farmer
[37:28] Market so buying directly all the things
[37:32] um food books uh Cafe uh Gadget
[37:37] everything directly in Bitcoin so easily
[37:40] so fast no
[37:42] intermediation h it was awesome
[37:46] so I I cannot expect something like that
[37:49] in Lugano because the situation is
[37:51] different in some regards better in some
[37:54] regards worse probably uh but I really
[37:58] love the idea that I can potentially
[38:01] leave right now in Lugano with Bitcoin
[38:04] only because there are 300 hundreds
[38:07] places accepting Bitcoin so I'm not sure
[38:10] if they covering everything you you need
[38:14] but with some services in the end you
[38:17] will find a way just like I mean buying
[38:20] some vouchers or um so I'm kind of
[38:25] pretty new to these things even if I'm
[38:28] in the space some years but I'm starting
[38:31] to experiment more with these services
[38:33] and trying to spend a little bit more of
[38:36] the myads all especially in U uh in
[38:40] Bitcoin circular economy I know there
[38:42] are plenty of people not plenty but some
[38:44] people would say uh yeah just like
[38:47] Bitcoin circular economy is just like
[38:49] people that want your SS yes they want
[38:52] my SS but I want their services and
[38:54] their products too so I think it's kind
[38:56] of fair so if I don't want their service
[39:00] they are not ask me uh they are I mean
[39:04] it's mutual and and that's okay if I
[39:07] find that I want to use viat I can still
[39:09] use viat all the way that I want so and
[39:13] but of course I I tend to think more uh
[39:16] when I use my SS and also really really
[39:19] help me with the quality of the product
[39:22] and the quality of my spending which is
[39:24] a very nice thing because Bitcoin told
[39:26] me to say
[39:28] a lot and and so this is my mindset all
[39:30] the time H but I also I think that for
[39:34] everyone that spend some sand in a
[39:38] circular economy there is the idea of
[39:41] helping the people around them and
[39:44] expecting to help uh that economy in the
[39:47] sense that the providers of the people
[39:50] are going to ask for Bitcoin and they're
[39:52] going to spend Bitcoin and it's going to
[39:54] create these very nice circular en
[39:57] environment where more people are
[40:00] accepting Bitcoin more people are used
[40:02] to bitcoin and and so on so you try to
[40:06] do that with the transaction a physical
[40:08] transaction and what I am noticing is
[40:11] just like uh uh in Lugano slowly it came
[40:16] from the from I mean it came from the
[40:20] top like an idea is not a grassroot
[40:22] movement coming from the people from the
[40:25] beach uh wanting some Bitcoin for their
[40:27] services just like very coordinated uh
[40:30] from the mayor from the
[40:32] municipality and but still it it is very
[40:35] nice because people are accepting uh
[40:38] Bitcoin many many shops many services
[40:41] and they're okay because from time to
[40:43] time you enter them and they are just
[40:45] like you are the first one okay I was in
[40:48] H McDonald in um I don't remember if was
[40:53] kasso mrio but I wasn't expecting to see
[40:55] the Bitcoin symbol and one of the two
[40:58] were like okay so easy we did a
[41:01] transaction and and that was okay in the
[41:04] other one they were like oh nobody asked
[41:06] us before you are the first
[41:08] one okay so both were McDonald's same
[41:12] area and completely different experience
[41:16] and so the second time we were like
[41:17] trying to manage that they they had to
[41:19] call the boss to understand how to do
[41:22] that and maybe you I mean you waste some
[41:25] of your time but but you feel just like
[41:29] proud because I'm the first one and the
[41:31] next time they are going to do that so
[41:34] it's a very an amazing sensation to to
[41:37] be uh the Catalyst in a way because you
[41:41] are bothering them you're the Catalyst
[41:44] of starting something and they for them
[41:47] that's the first time they are uh using
[41:50] accepting Bitcoin with all the tools and
[41:53] they started to think about Bitcoin and
[41:55] this is spreading and spreading very
[41:57] slowly but it's spreading I mean it's
[41:59] also a very small area so I would expect
[42:02] H it's going to be easy to cover uh also
[42:06] the area around the outside Lugano but
[42:11] uh so it's it's very nice I'm I'm really
[42:13] excited to go there but you also have to
[42:16] think that there is a um there is a
[42:20] physical Hub right now uh physical
[42:23] laboratory co-working uh and I love idea
[42:27] is going it's already kind of ready but
[42:30] it's going to be um open I think to the
[42:33] public soon and I really like the idea
[42:37] that there is a physical space where
[42:39] bitcoiners can come from all over the
[42:40] world working again on the project uh
[42:43] find each other uh to have a meet up uh
[42:47] every once in a while and I think that's
[42:51] really powerful uh I had this experience
[42:54] in the past in Milano uh I have been in
[42:56] other place is all around the world and
[43:00] online is incredible we can do most of
[43:02] the stuff of online but offline is where
[43:08] the magic happens for the reason why
[43:10] that we see each other there is this
[43:12] sort of a communication and as an
[43:16] Italian I would say that the majority of
[43:19] the project that the majority of the
[43:21] best stuff has always been in front of
[43:24] foot always discussing
[43:27] uh with some good food H and that's
[43:30] really I mean it's the quality of being
[43:33] together uh with that attention with
[43:37] that with everything that's being there
[43:40] provided so I'm super excited for Lugano
[43:44] not to only have the circular economy
[43:47] not to only have a conference not to
[43:49] have so many people working from there
[43:53] and uh and coming and moving to to
[43:56] Lugano because know plenty of people
[43:58] there are moving there we are not the
[43:59] only one I'm of course I'm excited about
[44:03] Plan B Network and initiative because
[44:05] it's about centralization in a good way
[44:08] of education so it's a giant eff of
[44:11] effort and of course I proud of the guys
[44:14] from for what they are doing but I was
[44:16] excited to have a place not only during
[44:19] the two three days during October but
[44:22] all year around in Lugano so keep an eye
[44:25] on Lugano because I think 20 24 is going
[44:28] to be an incredible year yeah I think uh
[44:32] and it's and we talked about it before a
[44:34] little bit uh this whole game field will
[44:37] play out the cities the places the
[44:41] countries that have adopted Bitcoin or
[44:44] at least are really friendly to bitcoin
[44:46] like most of the time they don't even
[44:47] have to be adopting Bitcoin they just
[44:50] have to be really friendly oh you don't
[44:51] have to pay taxes on that you can you
[44:54] can accept it in your stores you can do
[44:56] everything you want to do with Bitcoin
[44:58] and we just stand out of the way this is
[45:00] like if you have this kind of mindset as
[45:02] a government to bitcoin you will do
[45:05] really good in the next years you don't
[45:06] have even have to do crazy crazy stuff
[45:09] as as sa does of course this will
[45:11] benefit you even more but even just
[45:13] saying oh we are neutral to bitcoin uh
[45:16] you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin it's
[45:18] okay we will convert it back to our
[45:19] local currencies but you can pay your
[45:21] taxes in Bitcoin if you want yeah but
[45:23] but I I have to say that Switzerland is
[45:26] um is a special place for that so it was
[45:31] 2017 I was pregnant and I was um in a
[45:35] meeting with the municipality of kiasu
[45:38] which is a very small City on the border
[45:41] of Switzerland and I think that jako was
[45:44] supposed to be there but he couldn't so
[45:47] I was uh I was the one going there and
[45:51] so during this meeting I was like why
[45:55] don't you accept Bitcoin
[45:57] I was with the mayor and and the people
[46:00] uh from the municipality and I was why
[46:02] don't you accept uh Bitcoin for taxes a
[46:06] little bit slightly more than zuk
[46:09] because zuk was the city that was ass
[46:12] setting Bitcoin at the time for the uh
[46:15] most amount I think it's going to be a
[46:18] very huge marketing move and I was there
[46:22] and were like okay let's do that sounds
[46:25] just like a good idea uh it's going to
[46:28] be a matter of some days and I saw a
[46:31] news publish on the newspaper we're
[46:33] going to accept Bitcoin for taxes and
[46:35] we're going to be the city with where
[46:38] you can pay for bit in Bitcoin for the
[46:41] with the biggest amount and I was like
[46:44] oh my God it was just a random idea so
[46:47] Switzer not all the country are just
[46:49] like Switzerland right I I mean coming
[46:51] from Italy I was just like oh my God in
[46:54] Italy it wouldn't be possible because
[46:55] it's going to take years right uh month
[46:59] at least and everything was so smooth
[47:03] that I was really surprised because they
[47:06] didn't tell me anything else except I I
[47:09] heard from the newspaper directly and I
[47:11] was really really happy and I think they
[47:13] still accept Bitcoin for taxes not many
[47:15] people are paying for taxes in Bitcoin
[47:17] which sound really weird as a concept I
[47:20] always find it very weird uh
[47:23] but I I agree with you but there are
[47:28] places that are radier mentally and also
[47:32] bureaucratically more ready even at
[47:34] being neutral to bitcoin to others so I
[47:38] can expect I can expect my lovely
[47:40] country to be a beautiful hub for
[47:44] Bitcoin but I think Italian people for
[47:48] example are incredible in found the
[47:51] solution to
[47:53] circumvent uh uh the state and found
[47:56] crazy amazing solution for Bitcoin too
[47:59] it's not I don't think it's just um so
[48:03] extraordinary the fact that the first
[48:05] Bitcoin economy that is ever been
[48:08] created in the world was born in Italy
[48:11] RTO I was telling you before the Bitcoin
[48:13] Valley is so old I think it was
[48:17] 2015 16 maybe not the first one because
[48:21] there was also our name in the
[48:22] Netherlands so I guess it was the second
[48:24] but it was the the strong and
[48:26] concentration all over the world for
[48:28] years is not very well known outside
[48:32] Italy but you can find an article very
[48:34] nice article from Aron van Viro at
[48:37] Bitcoin magazine talking about the
[48:38] Bitcoin Valley how early they were in
[48:41] that so I think that I'm I'm very
[48:44] bullish on bitcoiners so I'm not that
[48:46] bullish on the state because I know it's
[48:49] complicated for many reasons even being
[48:52] neutral I love for them to be neutral
[48:55] but it's complet ated and bullish on
[48:58] bitcoiners they will find a way
[49:01] definitely and this is the message of
[49:02] think that is important we don't even
[49:04] need that I think it I think it will
[49:06] come then States will adopt it but we
[49:08] don't need it like Bitcoin works fine
[49:10] without it and on the topic of Italian
[49:13] governments and Bitcoin adoption in
[49:15] Italy how what's what's the state in in
[49:19] Italy how do the government see what's
[49:21] the Grassroots movement going through
[49:23] like is do you have like a uh for for
[49:27] people do so no no no um let's start
[49:30] from the good news the good news is I
[49:32] was telling you before I I curate a list
[49:35] of Italian resources around Bitcoin it's
[49:38] a very long list on GitHub and I started
[49:43] I think three years ago and so it was
[49:46] really really really short so it didn't
[49:49] take me so much time nowadays I have to
[49:52] push a merge every week and the last one
[49:57] last one was so huge because we got
[50:00] right now so many podcasts so many
[50:02] articles so many services accepting
[50:04] Bitcoin so many shops so many
[50:07] communities meetups you name it it's
[50:11] crazy everything completely in Italian
[50:14] uh for example German community is very
[50:17] active and so the Italian Community also
[50:19] the French Community is very active but
[50:22] Italian one was in the past it has some
[50:24] years that it wasn't right now is so
[50:27] strong so it's it's incredible and also
[50:31] are people there they don't stop they
[50:33] create so much stuff um I'm really
[50:36] really really proud of my country in
[50:38] that on the in the other part I think
[50:43] that they are I mean the government um
[50:47] they are really confused so as always uh
[50:50] right now we with the money um
[50:55] government uh um in a way it is better
[50:59] for some regards slightly better than in
[51:02] a past in other is worse and one of the
[51:05] thing they are was is about technology
[51:08] is about Improvement is about everything
[51:12] that it sounds I mean they are very
[51:17] Pro they are kind of conservative in
[51:20] that so I think they see Bitcoin just
[51:23] something from outside something scary
[51:25] something sh so actually during this
[51:29] year uh some rules have been made not as
[51:33] strong but against Bitcoin for the first
[51:36] time that they they are more aware than
[51:38] in the past and not in a good way uh but
[51:41] still it's really chaotic there's
[51:44] nothing that coordinating so this spot
[51:47] is still kind of off around Bitcoin so
[51:51] which is great is still great but there
[51:54] are signs there are coming and strongly
[51:58] as always I mean not always but as we
[52:01] have seen especially during the lockdown
[52:03] Italian police and government can be
[52:06] really strong in their rules and their
[52:09] law the enforcement likely is definitely
[52:13] not that
[52:15] homogeneous but uh I would suggest I
[52:19] mean I think that people that are doing
[52:22] business businesses and everything
[52:25] around Bitcoin in they are really Brave
[52:28] there is a space right now nothing's
[52:31] going to happen uh suddenly but uh I
[52:36] would
[52:37] very very aware that it's not going to
[52:40] last so be ready to move um because um
[52:47] they are not friendly with Bitcoin and
[52:49] not even neutral in my opinion H it will
[52:52] be interesting to see how the adoption
[52:54] will play out and what what what bit
[52:56] coiners will face in the next like five
[52:59] 10 20 years uh that will be really
[53:03] really interesting and I think uh uh
[53:05] every bitcoiner I'm so
[53:08] sorry no
[53:10] problem I usually I did not have any
[53:13] calls till now till any podcast today I
[53:16] got the thir
[53:18] one
[53:20] wow something something probably
[53:22] happened uh but uh it's it's okay um is
[53:26] there like in Italy I think every uh
[53:29] country has their own uh view of Bitcoin
[53:32] like it gets globalized with the digital
[53:35] Revolution with like social media and
[53:38] and everything yeah we have different uh
[53:41] kind of fuse still on bitcoin is there
[53:43] any specific Italian fut on bitcoin is
[53:48] there anything that Italians look
[53:50] differently to to bitcoin which the
[53:52] global Community would be like oh why
[53:54] why well I I in the Italian
[53:58] culture is um is a lot about uh saving
[54:02] money so for example if you get a
[54:04] discount or something that is going to
[54:06] be given for free oh my God Italian will
[54:10] run or you promise them some food they
[54:13] are going to run I think the incentives
[54:15] are kind of easy for Italian we are very
[54:18] easy people so if we are going to feel
[54:21] that we are going to save some money
[54:24] with Bitcoin I mean saving from from
[54:26] buying stuff or giving something to
[54:29] return just a small gift or something to
[54:32] eat they won't care that much about
[54:35] anything else especially in the center
[54:38] and the south of Italy people from the
[54:40] north of Italy are just more like in
[54:43] love with lows and we are very boring in
[54:46] that but the healthy part of Italy I
[54:50] think we respond very easily to to some
[54:53] very very I mean the same incentive that
[54:56] you usually uh would have with with kids
[55:00] so if you buy that with Bitcoin you're
[55:02] are going to save
[55:05] 30% that that's really interesting for
[55:07] the Italian culture and of course I
[55:10] think that it's going to be the same I
[55:12] mean the government is not that um that
[55:15] smart and I don't want to give ideas but
[55:18] I think that they want to to get a sort
[55:20] of a Bitcoin Ted Bitcoin cbdc accepted
[55:24] they should do the same
[55:27] I mean I don't want to give them ideas
[55:29] but the adoption will Skyrocket very
[55:32] easily with something like that right I
[55:34] think it's shared by most population but
[55:36] I think Italian are very I mean uh very
[55:41] fast and that I seen when there is some
[55:44] sort of a promotion and they love to to
[55:47] to to get after that so yeah that's
[55:50] pretty specific of Italy and that make
[55:53] me kind of hopeful for for the future
[55:56] in that but since we want to save our
[55:59] sets or whatever we are we have not
[56:02] reached that point yet but um I mean um
[56:07] also at the same time I'm very I'm very
[56:10] proud of Italian bitcoiners uh they are
[56:14] brave as I told before but also very
[56:17] productive in everything they do and
[56:19] very generous in uh in all the things
[56:23] that that they are organizing they are
[56:26] do and there is a we are passionate
[56:28] about that we are very passionate and
[56:29] also because we we have this
[56:32] state such a paternalistic state and
[56:37] also the people around us we are very
[56:38] passionate about freeing people and we
[56:42] have a lot of knowledge about how to
[56:46] circumvent um all these uh all this I
[56:51] don't know how to say yeah this culture
[56:53] one thing I don't really like about
[56:56] Italy just like we feel that we are
[56:58] victims right everybody is against us
[57:02] the Fate the government the WEA
[57:04] everything is against as personally but
[57:07] bitcoiners are just the the Italian
[57:09] bitcoiners are just the opposite today
[57:12] they they look for the future they save
[57:14] money for the Legacy they want to
[57:16] organize the stuff just because they
[57:18] want to do that and and that's a good
[57:21] example for anybody else around them at
[57:24] the beginning people are them I just
[57:25] like it those are weirdos why you do
[57:27] that you want to scam us in in a way but
[57:31] in the end they they
[57:33] are they are oh my God there is a term I
[57:37] have all in
[57:38] Italian they want
[57:41] to I mean it's going to start from there
[57:44] and it's going to uh go everywhere else
[57:49] and then it's going to be just like um
[57:53] yeah Italian bitcoiners are strong cat
[57:56] is to bitcoin that's that's good to hear
[58:00] and uh to to slowly come to the end of
[58:02] the podcast I always try to have like a
[58:05] vision for the future and what the
[58:07] Bitcoin standard would look like and for
[58:10] me it's interesting to hear different
[58:12] kind of answers to that because when we
[58:14] see Bitcoin in the future and I always
[58:17] make this comparison when you have a fat
[58:19] standard you're like uh on the beach uh
[58:23] and you are like knee deep in the water
[58:25] and you you try to run try to run in the
[58:28] KN deep water you will fall you will
[58:30] have a hard time going forward and then
[58:33] when you on a Bitcoin standard you're
[58:35] like on a solid Street you can run fast
[58:37] you can do like it's it's like when you
[58:40] have solid sound money you can run fast
[58:42] you can do stuff how do you imagine like
[58:44] Bitcoin changing a little bit Society uh
[58:48] has it an impact on society even because
[58:50] it's as some people say it's just money
[58:53] or does it has an impact on Society for
[58:56] like the next when we are on a Bitcoin
[58:58] standard so since you you have heard so
[59:01] many qu so many answer to that uh uh I
[59:05] won't focus on the the most trivial one
[59:07] but the one that I've been thinking a
[59:10] lot nowadays is about how Bitcoin is
[59:13] going to free us from
[59:17] our day today jobs and it's going to
[59:21] give us back a lot of our free time and
[59:24] this is going to boost the knowledge of
[59:27] the humanity too in that uh I have no
[59:31] small terms I think it's going to be
[59:35] it's going to have an enormous impact
[59:38] I'm imagining this I'm there is this
[59:41] expression that it's been used I mean
[59:43] just like Renaissance
[59:45] 2.0 but when I think of that is not
[59:50] something that I think politically I
[59:52] think is going to be just like during
[59:55] the Sho Italiano where all the people
[59:58] were together and they were in the same
[60:01] place there is this medich effect I
[60:04] don't know if you heard about that but
[60:07] from all these smart people having a lot
[60:10] of time staying together probably around
[60:14] some food again they were discussing
[60:16] they were improving the human knowledge
[60:19] because they have the time to focus on
[60:22] that because they have the also the will
[60:24] to stay together not Reinventing the whe
[60:27] and they wanted to boost that for the
[60:30] human humankind so I'm expecting that
[60:34] more people more and more people are
[60:36] free from
[60:38] daytoday uh stuff so they can focus on
[60:42] knowledge they can focus on their
[60:43] families they can focus on passion on do
[60:46] whatever they want and in return not
[60:49] only they are going to be happier than
[60:51] they are right now but I feel they are
[60:54] going to liberate
[60:56] a lot of value for all the humanity
[61:00] right now and in the future I'm
[61:02] expecting something like that not less
[61:05] I'm strongly strongly bullish on that
[61:07] because I I'm seeing that all these
[61:10] bitcoiners they can have a perspective
[61:13] on the future they can have over Hope on
[61:15] their future for themsel and and their
[61:18] legacy and so they can quit their job
[61:21] they can save the money they they can
[61:24] focus on the thing that really matters
[61:27] to them and they can really matter on
[61:30] improving uh the values for our society
[61:33] so can you imagine when more and more
[61:36] people can do that and they cannot be
[61:38] focused on being a slave for their
[61:41] bosses uh being I mean there's nothing
[61:45] bad in doing that absolutely not and if
[61:48] you don't leave just like that and if
[61:51] you're so happy doing your job it's
[61:54] amazing but since I know know so many
[61:57] people that they live in a terrible
[62:00] condition they are so unhappy with daily
[62:03] daily life they don't have free time
[62:05] they don't have time quality time to do
[62:07] the things they love they don't have
[62:09] time to stay with the kids and so also
[62:12] many people don't have the time to
[62:14] really study what the matters to them I
[62:17] imagine a Bitcoin standard the people
[62:20] will choose what to do with their time
[62:23] especially their free time free time
[62:26] leisure time it's so important we live
[62:29] in a society where this time is a nice
[62:33] to have I come from the idea you know in
[62:38] um ancient Greece and also in um in Rome
[62:42] there was a term for that especially in
[62:45] Rome there is a lotum oium was not uh so
[62:50] oium was the time you spent for yourself
[62:52] to grow yourself and there was negotium
[62:55] the time for business regarding others
[62:57] to get some money or whatever so what I
[63:01] want for the future and I imagine for
[63:03] the future um in a Bitcoin standard is
[63:06] more AUM more time for the things that
[63:09] make life beautiful more time that for
[63:12] the things that really matter for for us
[63:15] and for some of people either even
[63:18] sometime to improve the knowledge for
[63:21] everybody else this is going to be the
[63:24] real riment 2.0 that that I Envision I
[63:29] know it's a lot but I'm pretty
[63:32] pretty pretty sure in my very specific
[63:37] and accurate
[63:40] Vision I love it and I think this we all
[63:43] look forward to this Bitcoin future and
[63:45] we can even see it now like if you adopt
[63:48] the Bitcoin standard now uh your life
[63:50] definitely changes for the better uh if
[63:52] you actually become like a Bitcoin a
[63:54] mindset like even even if you don't have
[63:57] Bitcoin like let's make an experience
[64:00] like you you are bitcoiner for one year
[64:02] and you get the Bitcoin mindset but you
[64:04] lose all your your Bitcoin you're still
[64:08] uh having a knowledge gain a mindset
[64:11] gain is switch in your mind and you're
[64:13] still gaining something so even if you
[64:16] are getting a Bitcoin and you lost your
[64:18] Bitcoin for some reason and a boting
[64:20] accident as as I think you also and
[64:24] me yeah absolutely absolutely I I I I
[64:28] think that's yes it's about knowledge
[64:31] gain it's also about skill gain it's
[64:34] also mindset gain but it's also about
[64:37] all the people you have met your network
[64:39] is so powerful Bitcoin bit with
[64:42] bitcoiners I feel that especially when I
[64:45] was during the lockdown we were the
[64:48] first one experiencing that Iman and
[64:51] that was really crazy but having a
[64:54] network of bit Corners all around the
[64:57] world really made me hopeful really make
[65:00] me feel safe and so that was uh a very I
[65:05] wouldn't I wouldn't want to have a I
[65:07] mean such a specific situation to test
[65:10] that but it happened and to me it was
[65:14] everything because I felt it before but
[65:17] then it happened and so we received some
[65:19] packages from people helping us with
[65:22] stuff we couldn't find we we we even got
[65:26] some sets we even got some support we
[65:29] even got I mean it's so powerful the
[65:33] amazing people I have known because of
[65:36] Bitcoin uh the network I have because of
[65:39] bitcoiners Mak me feel really safe for
[65:42] myself and for I mean for my kids too so
[65:46] it's really it's really important the
[65:48] human factor is so undervalued and
[65:51] especially for bitcoiners we have been
[65:53] used to be the weirdest as I was saying
[65:55] you before and um it's it's tough for
[66:00] us uh it has been tough for us to find
[66:03] people that resonate with us now we got
[66:05] plenty all over the world which is uh
[66:08] incredible and so for example I I'm
[66:11] usually a kind of introvert and I don't
[66:13] talk that much but when I talk about
[66:15] Bitcoin oh my God I can talk for hours
[66:18] I'm a completely different person
[66:20] because I'm surrounded by people that I
[66:22] resonate with and as and every day I
[66:26] know more people that I can can also
[66:29] learn from it doesn't happen in my
[66:32] everyday life so even if Bitcoin goes to
[66:36] zero I don't own any sets
[66:39] anymore the gain it's so powerful so
[66:42] important for me I wouldn't say I don't
[66:45] care that much but actually it's very
[66:47] close to that
[66:49] yeah and we we definitely don't want to
[66:51] lose our Bitcoin but it happens from
[66:53] time to time
[66:56] well trust me we have done so many
[66:59] stupid things during this year
[67:02] right I this is why we want to tell
[67:04] people that all this stuff just like
[67:07] don't keep your Bitcoin on exchanges
[67:09] because it happened to us for example
[67:11] right yeah and uh just for people are
[67:13] listening now I have a podcast episode
[67:16] with Rick who lost to 25 Bitcoin uh
[67:20] where we also had Tony on like a cyber
[67:22] security expert and this is like one
[67:24] great episode like a I think has like
[67:26] three four really good episodes on self
[67:28] custody what we can do and stuff like
[67:29] that uh there's so much uh material but
[67:32] I encourage
[67:34] everybody get a good selfcast solution
[67:37] before you get extremely rich like get
[67:40] get it before you before you need it
[67:43] yeah and also I mean I talk about how
[67:46] amazing is to be surrounded by
[67:48] bitcoiners or whatever but at the same
[67:51] time you want to come again don't trust
[67:54] verify because I mean we are all human
[67:58] and even the the best people in in the
[68:01] worst situation can turn in somebody
[68:04] else and so uh keep everything safe it's
[68:08] not about be adversarial in everything
[68:10] you do but when you want to protect your
[68:13] value the value for yourself and your
[68:15] family you want to be uh be skeptical
[68:20] and to protect with self- custody in the
[68:22] best way you can and I think all the
[68:24] other B bitcoiners will understand that
[68:27] because that's the mindset we should
[68:29] have so um yeah don't trust verify it's
[68:34] it's an amazing quote we always have to
[68:37] to think about that it's uh it's the
[68:39] mindset of a bitcoiner it it doesn't
[68:41] change right and that's the beauty of it
[68:44] like it can uh you can look it up
[68:46] yourself you can do it yourself uh and
[68:49] this is amazing yeah we are having an
[68:51] end routine in the podcast where the
[68:53] previous guest is asking a question for
[68:54] the next guest guest uh and W the
[68:57] previous guest asked a question for you
[68:59] about uh Greg Wright I mean he he asked
[69:03] the question is Greg R Satoshi
[69:06] but but I it's kind of it's kind of easy
[69:09] I mean there's also important people
[69:11] that during these weeks told us that he
[69:14] is not but I we don't need those kind of
[69:17] people I was pretty sure about it even
[69:21] before so this is also like my take on
[69:24] it like it's it's like we we don't need
[69:26] the judge to tell us this it was so
[69:29] obvious before that but it's nice that
[69:33] we have a confirmation now yeah right
[69:36] right and it's cool because I mean also
[69:38] for an armies we can say there there is
[69:40] a sort of a important people from some
[69:44] institution they're telling us that is
[69:47] not correct right because majority of
[69:49] people will only believe in authorities
[69:51] and that's reality right and and the
[69:53] thing is even if the decision would have
[69:56] been different if the jury for ex like
[70:00] the the the judge and the jury like for
[70:02] some reason said oh he is sat Nakamoto
[70:06] what would it change nothing like yeah
[70:08] right exactly yeah absolutely perfect
[70:13] then thank it was such a pleasure to
[70:16] have you on such a like it's always
[70:20] really yeah with with people that you
[70:22] just met like we was on the first call
[70:24] like we we never spoke before that all
[70:27] and it like we we meet we we know each
[70:30] other for like a little while and thank
[70:33] you for speaking here thank you for
[70:34] being on the podcast absolutely and
[70:37] hopefully we will meet somewhere in some
[70:40] circular economies of some conferences
[70:42] and yes yeah I should have a question
[70:45] for the next guest or the next guest can
[70:49] be free because I have a question yes
[70:53] perfect I usually do it offline but you
[70:55] can you can say like no no no so I have
[70:58] more time to think about it
[71:01] so no no like I just don't want to
[71:05] pressure uh the the guest into saying a
[71:08] question or while we are going because
[71:11] like then it's like oh I have to think
[71:13] like and and and don't want the question
[71:15] to be like a good question uh even
[71:17] though there's no limited like there
[71:19] like you can do whatever and I will
[71:21] actually just take it to the next
[71:22] question the yeah awesome awesome it was
[71:26] a pleasure to having you on and thank
[71:28] you for taking your time and for people
[71:31] that have questions uh and want to reach
[71:34] out to you where can they reach you the

[72:05] also you can find me on Noster it is a
[72:07] little bit too long to remember
