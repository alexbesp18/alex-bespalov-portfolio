[00:00] you got to get humble and you got to
[00:02] laugh with yourself also being a
[00:04] bitcoiner is like accepting pain we kind
[00:07] of like pain because we kind of like
[00:09] proof of work so if you go to the gym
[00:11] you go to the gym to feel pain that's
[00:13] what you're addicted to you're addicted
[00:15] to that proof of work that will bring on
[00:17] the results that you envision if you
[00:19] change the incentives then people will
[00:21] change too I'm like what are you
[00:24] trying are you guys trying to kill me
[00:26] come on bitcoin prize is the scoreboard
[00:30] of how bad the fear system actually does
[00:33] the end whatever it does it goes up I'm
[00:36] always in a journey of squashing my ego
[00:39] eorn has helped me on that for
[00:41] [Music]
[00:45] sure I heard uh and I've seen it also
[00:49] that you're doing an X or Twitter space
[00:52] every day since since since quite a
[00:54] while right yeah I think today is like
[00:58] it's going to be the
[01:02] 1,00 12 or 13th
[01:05] day uh so it's like more than three
[01:09] years non nonstop every
[01:13] day yeah that wow that's that's really
[01:16] that's really impressive that's soon
[01:17] four years because at 1,200 days oh no
[01:21] no you need more than that I calculate
[01:23] with 300 but yeah that's a that's a lot
[01:26] of so every day you did that uh and you
[01:30] did it in in order to till we hit
[01:33] 100,000 what was the plan there um yeah
[01:37] so DB started as a joke as a
[01:40] meme um near the was
[01:45] 2021 we were at at around I think uh 60
[01:50] something and everyone back then
[01:53] was uh really ecstatic and really happy
[01:57] and they were saying uh stuff like like
[02:00] oh it will take us like a week or few
[02:04] weeks to go to 100 like that's nothing
[02:07] so I was like okay if that happens which
[02:11] I thought also I believed also back then
[02:15] I I was like okay why don't I start like
[02:17] a silly
[02:19] space um kind of surreal where basically
[02:23] I open the space I play I play the song
[02:26] by Journey Don't Stop Believing hod to
[02:29] that
[02:30] feeling three
[02:32] times and and that's it and I do that
[02:37] for as long as we take to reach 100K
[02:41] thinking it's going to be like two weeks
[02:43] Max right uh what I didn't know and what
[02:49] Bitcoin um usually did do Bitcoin does
[02:54] that a lot it does the exact opposite of
[02:57] what we expect to to do
[03:00] so I started the space three days before
[03:04] the actual
[03:06] top and I had to hold on to my
[03:10] pledge for more than three years now
[03:14] nonstop
[03:16] weekends um if I I was away with no
[03:20] power if I was
[03:23] uh even like sick and everything I kept
[03:26] on doing that space and obviously that's
[03:29] space change a little bit after
[03:32] um after a while because I figure out
[03:36] like in the between the songs I can have
[03:39] commentary I comment what was happening
[03:44] those days in Twitter and around Bitcoin
[03:47] obviously with like a a funny Spin and
[03:51] um like a standup kind of thing
[03:55] right that's super it's it's like
[03:58] starting as as a meme start is uh almost
[04:01] like a choke uh and thinking like oh we
[04:04] soon hit there I will do it like a month
[04:06] or something like that but the the the
[04:09] the big thing for me is you kept going
[04:11] and I try to do a daily podcast and I
[04:15] cheat because I pre-record episodes
[04:18] there's a whole week where I don't
[04:19] record anything because in the previous
[04:21] week I have two per day so that's it's
[04:24] not cheating but it's like scheduling uh
[04:26] in a sense but doing it Act every day
[04:31] that that's a whole another level and
[04:33] and doing it live so like people can
[04:34] actually chime in so that that that is
[04:37] some that's some discipline right right
[04:40] there some Pro of work that's why I
[04:42] think people love it are loving it still
[04:45] now because like it's like an example of
[04:48] like something that we bitcoiners love
[04:50] like proof of work kind of an example
[04:52] like it's like an allegory for holding
[04:55] also through the bare
[04:56] market and going all those uh links we
[05:00] go through through the ups and downs of
[05:03] the of the market and how uh Bitcoin
[05:07] makes us react I guess so that's how I
[05:11] feel like uh
[05:13] yeah still
[05:17] going how long I mean we're recording
[05:19] now because this will probably come out
[05:21] like one two weeks after that so maybe
[05:24] when people listen to that it actually
[05:26] already hit the 100K but
[05:29] long do you think we we still going with
[05:32] with the
[05:34] space if I say that okay I'll say it
[05:37] like because like I can take it like I I
[05:40] figure out that I I can take more than I
[05:43] I expected I could so I guess like
[05:47] um TW I'll say 23rd of December there
[05:52] just a just a random date that a few
[05:55] will
[05:57] understand I I I would love I think it
[06:00] even tweeted it out when Bitcoin was at
[06:03] I think 80k or 85k or something like
[06:05] that I tweeted out uh I would love a
[06:08] 100K bitcoin price at Christmas Eve so
[06:11] that that's kind of like I would love
[06:13] that just like as a as a conversation
[06:16] with the family dinner because I have
[06:18] also really big family and not everyone
[06:20] is into Bitcoin so that that would be a
[06:22] great conversation for me uh to have but
[06:24] yeah it's it seems to be actually quite
[06:29] possible that we actually hit the 100
[06:30] 100 game we were very close already I
[06:32] think 995 or something like that we were
[06:34] up there yeah I think in some exchanges
[06:37] it was 200 bucks away from the actual
[06:43] goal so yeah how how is um I'm really
[06:48] into that that like whole discipline and
[06:51] proof work thing right now and we move
[06:53] on to other topics but uh it's it's
[06:55] really interesting how is that feeling
[06:58] when we're now so close because for the
[07:00] past three years most of the time we
[07:03] were a good good distance from 100K away
[07:06] like 20 30 uh 40 sometimes even almost
[07:10] we were down at like 16k so that that
[07:14] that is a long way to 100K so how does
[07:16] it now feel to be so freaking close to
[07:19] the 100K oh I'm I'm making at least like
[07:23] once a day I'm making a meme about stop
[07:26] jinxing it to everyone like could would
[07:29] you please stop saying like oh 100K Easy
[07:33] by the end of the day like come on would
[07:36] you please stop saying that you know so
[07:41] I'm like very cautious in those uh areas
[07:44] because like I know how Bitcoin as I
[07:47] said before can do exactly the opposite
[07:50] thing you're expecting to do I'm I'm
[07:52] guilty of that Meme I think I tweeted it
[07:54] out three times last week it's Humane I
[07:58] understand why people do it you know but
[08:00] like when you have something extra uh
[08:03] like me uh on the line you know you're
[08:05] like guys calm down you know let's get
[08:09] there and then we're
[08:11] party um for for the themes of the
[08:13] spaces I'm curious uh so you the first
[08:17] it was just like you wanted to play just
[08:19] three times that song and then you
[08:21] started coming in in things so did are
[08:24] you now at the stage where you actually
[08:26] prepare for things or you just go in
[08:28] there and talk mind nah I don't prepare
[08:31] I don't prepare the only preparation is
[08:33] that I I watch and I listen to a lot of
[08:36] music I listen to a lot of music I watch
[08:39] to a lot of pop culture like TV series
[08:41] and movies so whenever I have a good
[08:44] idea of a good R let's say that's
[08:47] something I want to say and inspire
[08:49] people or hype people up just a little
[08:53] bit especially in the bare Market I will
[08:55] get like an idea from here and there and
[08:58] I will make it work some how on the spot
[09:01] for um yeah I I haven't prepared I think
[09:05] anything on the everything is on the
[09:08] fight yeah what were some of your
[09:11] highlights over the years probably like
[09:14] there's some moments where people join
[09:15] and then you talk about interesting
[09:17] things uh I mean there are a lot of lot
[09:20] of episodes a lot of spaces for you to
[09:22] choose now over thousand uh I'm when
[09:25] people ask me about that the same thing
[09:28] with just 300 episod I'm completely
[09:30] overwhelmed because there's so many but
[09:32] uh do you remember any highlights that
[09:34] stand out oh yeah yeah like especially
[09:37] uh when we were in the bare Market I
[09:40] think it was the most funny and fun
[09:43] spaces we had um
[09:46] because like uh I don't know the bare
[09:49] Market is way better for the memes for
[09:51] some reason and um
[09:55] um acknowledging that you got to get H
[10:00] and you got to laugh with yourself also
[10:03] with your choices so for that reason I
[10:06] feel like it's way funnier and I had
[10:08] like a few yeah spaces that I can think
[10:11] about like obviously I did some spaces a
[10:14] series of spaces where we're doing
[10:16] meditation I was putting like background
[10:19] very chill like guitar music playing and
[10:23] I was
[10:24] like pretending to be like a yoga Guy
[10:28] saying breathe in breathe out hold on to
[10:32] your stock stuff like that so those were
[10:35] funny and obviously at some point I got
[10:38] tired of it I got tired of um not going
[10:42] more down and not more going more uh not
[10:46] pumping at around 20K and I said okay
[10:50] [ __ ] it uh 23rd of December is going to
[10:53] be the prophecy day it's like it's like
[10:56] a new meme that happened right there and
[10:58] here there that basically I said from
[11:02] the 23rd of December we start pumping
[11:04] like the bare Market is over and for two
[11:07] weeks I was preaching that people were
[11:11] calling me the prophet and all that it
[11:13] was funny because I was just a week off
[11:17] and like after a week we actually
[11:20] started bouncing from 17K and starting
[11:24] rising and uh so I called the bottom
[11:28] somehow
[11:30] and uh the yeah the prophecy spaces were
[11:33] also
[11:34] funny and I've done others like I was
[11:37] pretending to be Batman on the Shadows
[11:40] of the bear Market watching stacking
[11:43] slowly you know taking my Vance like
[11:46] there there's there's a bunch of silly
[11:48] stuff I did on the on the spaces because
[11:51] we're talking about a lot of spaces
[11:55] every day for three more years you
[11:57] know did did did you record those uh
[12:01] spaces they're all recorded yeah and
[12:04] Shout out and shout out to Seth crazy
[12:07] one a dsb that uh actually found a way
[12:11] to download those spaces and we going to
[12:13] put them somewhere in a in um in a site
[12:17] with transcript so you can search them
[12:20] you
[12:20] know I think that would be great yeah I
[12:23] think because there a lot of content
[12:26] yeah it's probably also maybe invaluable
[12:29] in there maybe some history in there uh
[12:32] the pro prophecy is is in there 23rd
[12:35] really
[12:37] interesting yeah how how has been the uh
[12:42] it's really interesting for me the the
[12:43] difference between the bull and the bare
[12:44] Market uh bare Market I personally like
[12:48] more it's a little calmer a little bit
[12:49] more signal a little bit more like oh
[12:51] yeah like you can actually work and in
[12:53] the bull market even I usually never
[12:56] looked at the price till like October
[12:59] September this year and then it like
[13:02] started Rising again and and now it's I
[13:05] really have to like oh not not not look
[13:07] at the price too much uh because like
[13:09] yeah okay we at 97 now 96 now at 98 so
[13:14] it really it's almost addicted to
[13:16] addictive to to look at the price uh how
[13:19] do you look at like the bull market
[13:20] versus bare Market
[13:22] times Well in the bare Market it's like
[13:26] whoever is left in the bare market for
[13:28] me is like like me what what I mean is
[13:32] like similar ideology we believe in
[13:36] something and it's not like the guys
[13:38] that show up on the bull market that
[13:40] don't believe on bitcoin but they are
[13:44] more focused on the price which I
[13:46] understand it has its importance for
[13:48] sure I'm not like um playing down the
[13:52] price for sure the price going up plays
[13:55] a lot of
[13:56] the uh an important um reason why this
[14:00] is this thing is successful right
[14:03] so yeah but like in the bull market for
[14:06] some reason like the idiots come back or
[14:09] join and we become idiots for some
[14:12] reason as you said like we don't do
[14:14] anything productive not even our Fiat
[14:17] jobs and we keep on Staring at the price
[14:20] like we become like uh it's really
[14:22] addictive as you said so uh yeah uh
[14:26] that's why I prefer like um the bur
[14:28] Market get it's more
[14:31] honest it's it's it's less distractions
[14:34] less less noisy there there's so many
[14:36] distractions coming out with the the
[14:39] bull market I also like I never heard
[14:41] about lending and borrowing against your
[14:43] Bitcoin and now all of the other bull
[14:45] market starts like all those things
[14:47] coming back again uh it's it's it's it's
[14:49] really interesting for me how how this
[14:52] really behaves I mean it's it's not my
[14:54] first bull market uh I went through the
[14:56] 2021 one uh but uh it's it's h i like I
[15:02] really love 20202 and
[15:04] 2023 uh even though they were also good
[15:07] years especially Al 2023 but this year
[15:10] there's so much happening Al with the
[15:11] presidential election I feel like
[15:13] politics is too much into Bitcoin I talk
[15:15] too much about politics on the podcast
[15:18] yeah yeah politics and in general the
[15:22] normi world has creeped in on bitcoin
[15:25] for sure more I understand but closing
[15:29] the the subject of the bare Market I
[15:30] feel
[15:32] also like for me being a bitcoiner is
[15:36] like accepting pain we kind of like pain
[15:40] because we kind of like proof of work so
[15:43] if you go to the gym you go into the gym
[15:46] to feel pain basically that's what
[15:49] you're addicted to right you're addicted
[15:52] to that proof of work that will bring on
[15:55] the results that you that you envision
[15:58] right
[15:59] but let's
[16:01] not let's not like uh dress it uh uh
[16:06] let's not like um present it otherwise
[16:10] that it is it is pain in the end that
[16:13] thing is pain that is a sacrifice and we
[16:16] are kind of addicted to that to too
[16:18] right so I don't know I like the the
[16:21] feeling of Bitcoin
[16:25] dropping uh the newbies or whoever
[16:29] doesn't understand that kind of
[16:30] mentality
[16:32] panicking and we are laughing about it
[16:37] we are laughing about it because we know
[16:39] at some point it's going to pump again
[16:42] and we are laughing about it because now
[16:44] we have the other opportunity to stock
[16:47] even more so it's like I don't
[16:51] know ah it's do you think that proof of
[16:56] work mentality might be something that
[16:59] becomes mainstream if Bitcoin becomes
[17:01] mainstream is that does that come from
[17:03] that incentive structure of of having
[17:05] sound money yeah like the key word that
[17:07] you said is that the incentives if they
[17:09] s incentives like change in the most
[17:13] most platforms out there that exist to
[17:17] be structur around incentives that if
[17:19] you do the proof of work you're going to
[17:21] get uh rewarded yes then yes people more
[17:24] will uh switch that mentality towards
[17:27] hours let's say
[17:29] but until then if the incentives are
[17:32] keep on being like now you can uh pretty
[17:35] much do nothing be nonproductive and you
[17:38] get
[17:39] rewarded why people change why would
[17:42] people change like there's no point for
[17:44] them you know so so we have to get rid
[17:47] of the Fiat system in order to get to
[17:50] productive Society you gotta you got to
[17:53] change the incentives on any platform on
[17:56] any structure if you change the
[17:59] incentives then people would change too
[18:01] I
[18:02] feel it's it's interesting for me the
[18:05] the proof of work aspect of uh of
[18:07] Bitcoin um how did how did Bitcoin uh
[18:11] change you uh were you disciplined
[18:13] before that and could you have Ked up
[18:16] such a space before that it's a good
[18:18] question
[18:21] um yeah I was disciplined except one
[18:25] thing food
[18:28] no in general I am a discipl I feel like
[18:31] I'm I'm kind of I have I used to do like
[18:34] uh Athletics and all that like I I used
[18:36] to swim and all that like so I I know
[18:39] the word of being
[18:41] like you have to wake up 6:00 in the
[18:44] morning and go train and go to the
[18:47] school and all that so I was doing that
[18:49] until my 20s in general most of my life
[18:54] I am I can say I am disciplined
[18:59] I could have been
[19:02] more
[19:05] and yeah that's how I changed though but
[19:08] like
[19:09] Bitcoin how I changed that's that's a
[19:12] difficult question how I changed I mean
[19:15] maybe you haven't changed that
[19:17] much no I have because I can I can I can
[19:21] sense that I have a change of how others
[19:25] close me um react to me
[19:29] like in contrast to the older days right
[19:33] their their their reaction around me
[19:35] it's not the same so something
[19:37] definitely has changed I I cannot
[19:40] pinpoint exactly what maybe it's my
[19:43] attitude maybe it's I'm more focused at
[19:48] some points of what I want to do with my
[19:51] life uh maybe it's the
[19:55] ability have a clearer a better ability
[19:58] now to differentiate the [ __ ] than
[20:01] the
[20:03] real maybe maybe it's that that Bitcoin
[20:06] gave me that
[20:08] perspective yeah it's also interesting
[20:11] for me uh why we change it's obviously
[20:14] be because so many people uh don't get
[20:17] it that if they're outside of the
[20:20] Bitcoin uh bubble and it's like a very
[20:22] small uh minority group still like we
[20:25] are very selected group of people very
[20:28] very small especially those who actually
[20:30] get it and not just like have it in some
[20:32] portfolio or have some um capacity in in
[20:36] Bitcoin but like actually do the Deep
[20:38] work have like hundreds hours of uh
[20:41] research in there it's like a very small
[20:43] group and they actually usually change
[20:47] to a certain degree they obviously
[20:49] people that maybe already got the the
[20:51] mindset and then got early into Bitcoin
[20:53] and and it was just a fit for them uh
[20:56] maybe they are existing those kind of
[20:57] people I don't know uh but most people
[20:59] that I met actually and I asked that
[21:02] question a lot because I'm really
[21:03] curious on that they they changed uh and
[21:07] that's why it always makes me curious
[21:08] okay we have now this amazing money uh
[21:12] that's only used by a very small amount
[21:15] very small group of people and those
[21:18] that small group of people experien
[21:20] something very beautiful where the life
[21:22] changes what if that actually happens
[21:25] for the whole world like how does that
[21:28] Bitcoin will it look like obviously it's
[21:30] a long way there obviously we have to be
[21:33] long time patient in order to seeing
[21:35] that as as your example with the 100K
[21:38] even even shows because for me it's like
[21:40] the 100K and the the the Bitcoin US
[21:43] dollar price is kind of scoreboard of of
[21:45] how bad the uh field system actually uh
[21:49] does so that it's really really
[21:52] interesting how to see uh the the new
[21:55] world uh in in Bitcoin the the as as the
[21:59] the we would say the New World Order
[22:02] yeah as as Z would say like there's
[22:05] there's different kind of
[22:07] like uh Bitcoins right there's the
[22:11] network there's the social layer there's
[22:14] the your Hardware wallet there's the
[22:17] running your node like there there's
[22:19] different kind of Bitcoins out there
[22:21] that in in in some make what we say we
[22:24] call Bitcoin right and if we take like
[22:28] two examples of a bitcoiner just like I
[22:32] don't know buying Bitcoin 5 years old
[22:35] five five years ago right he buys let's
[22:39] say Bitcoin five years ago and he just
[22:42] like forgets about it never never gets
[22:46] him involved in the
[22:48] culture the a little bit of podcast a
[22:51] little bit of the books opening his mind
[22:54] like that kind of like interaction with
[22:56] other bitcoiners
[22:58] let's say and he just like joins again
[23:01] after Bitcoin has pumped we cannot say
[23:05] that Bitcoin change that guy it didn't
[23:08] do [ __ ] to him or her right so you have
[23:14] to get yourself involved with a lot of
[23:17] aspects of what Bitcoin is and
[23:21] especially uh talk with other bitcoiners
[23:25] I feel is more the most important in
[23:27] order to
[23:29] experience that
[23:31] change so it's the the cultural layer
[23:35] the the the research layer the the
[23:37] deeper going layer where you actually
[23:40] the social layers of Bitcoin that
[23:42] actually might change you and and less
[23:46] the they're just oh I got more money now
[23:49] it's the structure of the same of of the
[23:52] of the network and the incentives that
[23:56] that the network puts that that feeds
[23:59] those kind of ideas that a few smart
[24:02] Bitcoin understand and propagate and
[24:07] others understand by interact with those
[24:10] bitcoiners I feel like it's like a
[24:13] beautiful Str tree it's a beautiful tree
[24:17] that you have to see in each hole and
[24:20] not just focus
[24:22] on the Apple you
[24:25] know it's it's a whole ecosystem that
[24:28] yeah that change you I feel absolutely
[24:32] and and and most just uh focus on that
[24:35] one small top on top of the tree which
[24:38] is the price yeah exactly yeah uh that
[24:41] has its importance but it's not
[24:45] everything what is uh before we get a
[24:48] little bit to the price because I want
[24:49] to talk about the importance of the 100K
[24:51] also but what is what is for you the
[24:53] most important aspect of Bitcoin if you
[24:56] have to to to to put a uh pointed one
[25:00] the the incentives like again the the
[25:03] the the idea that in order to have
[25:06] something and make something you have to
[25:09] put the work I think that's the most
[25:12] important
[25:13] thing uh that I have get I have gotten
[25:16] out of this in order to get to build
[25:20] anything of value and gross anything it
[25:23] needs work that's it nothing is given to
[25:27] you
[25:29] Nothing is for
[25:31] free did you in the beginning also come
[25:34] for the price uh
[25:36] oh oh yeah I I came for the price also
[25:40] in a in a big uh in a big percentage for
[25:44] the price yes even though I was like
[25:46] ideologically a little bit uh with what
[25:50] Bitcoin represented and I I I learned
[25:54] through those kind of forums let's say
[25:57] uh in the end was uh inside the
[26:00] austerity years here in Greece and I was
[26:02] like I have to make something I have to
[26:06] risk more and get some money
[26:10] somehow and lift myself you know because
[26:14] I didn't want to leave Greece as many of
[26:16] my uh family and friends were doing back
[26:19] then uh to find work somewhere else so I
[26:22] was like okay Bitcoin what is this so
[26:25] yeah a big percentage was price and
[26:28] that's
[26:28] good that's the cheese um Bitcoin
[26:32] presents to all the newbies to get them
[26:35] inside to entice
[26:36] them and uh if you stick around a little
[26:40] bit more you understand oh yeah okay uh
[26:43] NZ H technology is important I get it
[26:46] but there's so many more things around
[26:49] this thing that have value
[26:52] right and there are many people that
[26:55] don't fall down this Rabbit Hole I feel
[26:57] like they people that just like come and
[27:00] they see Bitcoin for a price they put it
[27:01] in the portfolio and and and that's the
[27:04] end of of of the rabbit hole Journey um
[27:07] what made what made you
[27:09] go a step deeper uh what what made you
[27:13] go like from it's interesting that the
[27:16] priz and it's good technology I want to
[27:18] benefit from that what made you discover
[27:21] the the revolution behind Bitcoin all my
[27:24] all my all my mistakes I did in the
[27:26] journey thank God I wasn't that
[27:30] successful like I didn't buy 10,000
[27:33] coins somewhere and forgot about them
[27:35] and then like ah you know I'm a
[27:38] multimillionaire so I thought I was more
[27:42] clever and I did every mistake there is
[27:45] out there I trusted uh Mount Cox with my
[27:50] coins I uh I mined feathercoin because I
[27:55] thought mining Bitcoin back then with
[27:57] graphic cards was was uh too expensive
[28:00] so I tried trading uh I went to the SE
[28:04] coins in 2017 I did all the
[28:07] mistakes in
[28:10] order not not have in order for me to
[28:14] wanting more let's say I was losing just
[28:18] enough in order for me to stay in
[28:21] another
[28:22] cycle right
[28:25] so that made me going enough another
[28:28] cycle and another cycle learning more
[28:30] and leing more and at some point I was
[28:32] like oh okay there's more to
[28:36] this I get it now I partnered up with
[28:40] coin vigilante this is the most
[28:43] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[28:46] saw created by anyone look at that
[28:48] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[28:51] made an perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[28:54] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[28:57] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:00] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[29:03] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[29:06] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:10] watch collections you have the date of
[29:12] the first ever Mind Bitcoin Block in
[29:16] there and of course also the block
[29:18] height and which EPO we are currently in
[29:21] I love the level of detail they put in
[29:24] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[29:26] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:29] the time pieces down in the descriptions
[29:32] I love those watches so so much if you
[29:35] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:37] regular basis I'll guess you already
[29:39] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[29:42] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[29:45] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[29:48] personal recommendation for Hardware
[29:49] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[29:52] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[29:54] gift for a friend who has still their
[29:57] Bitcoin on on an exchange and you can
[29:59] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[30:03] the checkout visit bitbox Doss SL
[30:07] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[30:09] step is to really level up your
[30:11] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[30:14] have the most secure self custody setup
[30:17] you have to secure your own devices you
[30:20] have to protect your privacy you have to
[30:23] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[30:25] on where you live you even want to have
[30:28] have a plan B a citizenship where you
[30:30] can move in case something goes really
[30:32] really wrong and through all those steps
[30:34] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[30:37] step by step and if you visit the
[30:40] Bitcoin way.com
[30:41] Partners slobin you even get a 30 minute
[30:45] free call to find out how you can level
[30:48] up your
[30:50] sovereignty do you get the mount Cox
[30:52] coins back I heard I think a few months
[30:54] back that they they're starting to to
[30:56] pay back yeah I got like 50% something
[31:00] like that 16
[31:02] 70% not not not bad at all actually
[31:05] really cool uh you were also um there
[31:08] then in the Bitcoin cash time so you
[31:10] fell uh 2017 for for for shitcoins is
[31:15] how did you live through the the block
[31:17] size uh Wars trying to figure out more
[31:20] those those years were um years that I
[31:23] spend more in the technicalities of how
[31:26] actually it works and what it is to be
[31:29] decentralized so
[31:33] basically I also I also didn't like the
[31:36] way Roger ver and those companies
[31:39] reacted back then trying to control uh
[31:43] the chain through closed doors so those
[31:47] kind of like ideas pushed me to say okay
[31:51] the guys that are saying for um the guys
[31:55] that selling hats have a point
[31:58] like shout out to Samson ma um yeah we
[32:03] this this thing shouldn't be run by uh
[32:07] Mega corporations with like huge data
[32:10] centers like that that can happen too
[32:13] you can run mine Bitcoin like that too
[32:16] but if someone wants to to mine with his
[32:20] let's say bit ax right now at his house
[32:24] or running an old assis minor just to
[32:28] heat up his uh apartment he can also do
[32:31] that
[32:31] too so I feel like those years were the
[32:37] years of understanding what
[32:39] decentralization is for for maybe if
[32:42] there's some some new newer guy girl in
[32:46] here um what what does make Bitcoin
[32:50] decentralized I actually got that
[32:51] question yesterday from my girlfriend
[32:53] because she understands that it
[32:54] decentralized nobody can manipulate it
[32:56] she's like oh but how is it even
[32:58] decentral why why can't it nobody uh
[33:01] competed what what is the most important
[33:03] aspect
[33:04] here well geographical uh
[33:07] decentralization first not everything
[33:09] being in like in a specific country
[33:13] geographical decentralization is once
[33:15] the other thing is um easy easy of
[33:21] running a mining mining um uh like a
[33:25] machine like a NIS Miner right
[33:28] uh if you have like uh bigger blocks you
[33:31] need more expensive equipment and if you
[33:35] up the
[33:37] megabytes on that chain let's say
[33:39] Bitcoin Cas as they do or bsv that th
[33:43] those that that equipment becomes more
[33:45] and more expensive so it means like less
[33:48] and less people are mining small miners
[33:52] right so that's that's another aspect of
[33:55] being decentralized like more people
[33:58] people independently mining right that's
[34:02] that's the format with this
[34:04] realization and uh the the main one the
[34:07] main thing that now we are trying to
[34:10] solve is uh the mining pools like if we
[34:15] can like find a way to decentralize the
[34:19] mining pools also without restricting
[34:23] some aspects of
[34:24] it um that goes
[34:29] that that that would help a lot to to to
[34:32] what is truly decentralized there is you
[34:35] know like being decentralized it's not
[34:37] like you are and you
[34:39] aren't it's always like an effort that
[34:42] you have to improve on
[34:44] it you know uh I feel like Bitcoin is
[34:50] the most
[34:51] decentralized out of all the other
[34:53] projects out
[34:54] there it doesn't mean that Bitcoin
[34:57] cannot be more
[34:59] decentralized for sure it
[35:01] can it's not it's not a switch that you
[35:04] can just add or you centralize or um
[35:06] decentralized it's it's it's like a
[35:08] progress It's with security in general
[35:10] like security there is no 100% secure
[35:14] system that's just like uh a very secure
[35:17] system but it always has tradeoffs in
[35:19] there so I think that's a good good
[35:21] inside how how concerned are you with
[35:24] with the mining pool centralization
[35:26] because there's like I
[35:28] a few big ones and they control most of
[35:30] the
[35:32] network well it's a big discussion I'm
[35:35] not that concerned
[35:38] because
[35:41] if if they want to do something worse
[35:45] they could have done it already like for
[35:48] years now we have those kind of more
[35:50] centralized mining pools right if they
[35:53] wanted to do something worse they could
[35:56] have done it already so
[35:58] uh yes there there some Shenanigans in
[36:00] there with uh the rewards for sure and
[36:04] that's why some very smart people are
[36:07] trying to
[36:08] fix how the rewards are redistributed
[36:12] right and and they should be
[36:14] redistributed more
[36:16] fairly and uh if that being succeed it's
[36:21] going to
[36:22] be
[36:24] um it's going to be a big win for sure
[36:27] for the decentralization of the network
[36:30] but that doesn't mean that even now I'm
[36:33] like concerned about it you know I don't
[36:36] think I don't think Bitcoin for now has
[36:39] uh something being to be concerned uh
[36:42] when it comes to the code it has
[36:46] to a very a very big change must happen
[36:51] yeah so I so I should be concerned yeah
[36:54] of course
[36:55] um there's a bunch of of uh IP IPS that
[37:00] now have been posted
[37:03] that there there's a a lot of a lot of
[37:06] discussions around them like the
[37:08] covenants and all that I'm in favor of
[37:10] the covenants in
[37:12] general like
[37:13] uh I feel like even opcat at some point
[37:17] they they have they have like
[37:20] a
[37:22] um they have some basis that it could
[37:26] help uh it seems like uh up cut in
[37:30] Bitcoin cash like it's not like
[37:33] something uh that that it works like in
[37:37] uh um it's not doing anything bad to the
[37:40] chain so it's it's it's been tested
[37:43] somehow at some at some point so I'm in
[37:47] favor in general of doing upgrades to
[37:50] the network I'm not one of those guys
[37:52] that I'm afraid to upgrade the network
[37:56] you know but uh of course I'm in favor
[37:58] of caution and uh checking the code and
[38:03] discussing it a lot and fighting
[38:06] fighting on Twitter about
[38:08] it I I mean that makes it valuable right
[38:11] like you don't want to uh make your if
[38:15] you trust your entire Financial energy
[38:19] to this to this technology you don't
[38:21] want to change let it change overnight
[38:23] or like change it every second week
[38:26] because Bitcoin is that amazing
[38:27] technology where you can actually put it
[38:29] somewhere and you don't have to follow
[38:31] the news like with a stock or something
[38:33] like that that's the whole whole purpose
[38:34] of that but we still have to get to the
[38:37] point where uh we have to upgrade it I
[38:40] think if we stop upgrading Bitcoin right
[38:43] now and nobody's developing anything uh
[38:46] the likelihood that it fails uh is quite
[38:49] High I think yeah it's going to be it's
[38:53] going to it's going to become like um
[38:58] uh the current banking system I don't
[39:00] know if you if you know this but like
[39:03] the current banking system it's run by
[39:06] machines made in 1970s that like 10
[39:11] people actually know how to to to
[39:14] program them like it's this is true like
[39:17] the whole system is run like in
[39:20] 1970s machines so yeah I don't want to
[39:24] see it see something similar with uh
[39:26] Bitcoin of
[39:28] course um if you're going to experiment
[39:31] a lot with Bitcoin with Bitcoin I mean
[39:35] the favor of doing it on top of it not
[39:37] in the base layer but that doesn't mean
[39:40] you don't have to improve the base layer
[39:43] somehow very simply once once in a while
[39:46] you
[39:47] know there are simple small bucks to fix
[39:50] there are things to clean up so and not
[39:52] not even changing things like we're not
[39:54] talking about changing the block size or
[39:56] something like bigger bigger like that
[39:58] it's just like
[40:00] improving maintaining the code basically
[40:04] uh because we know how much technology
[40:05] changes in like 10 20 years only uh we
[40:08] we kind of have to keep Bitcoin up to
[40:10] date but that's that's beauty of it
[40:12] right everyone can do that and and
[40:14] there's a lot of vested interest from a
[40:16] lot of different parties to actually do
[40:18] that because everyone is aware of but
[40:21] one one thing that I thought about when
[40:22] you were saying yeah like uh of course
[40:25] it has it flaws of course it has is not
[40:28] 100% decentralized no nothing is it's
[40:31] like once you think about that uh for me
[40:34] it's always but even if there would be a
[40:37] flaw like what would I sell it for like
[40:40] what else would I bet on like it's the
[40:43] it's the best horse in the in the in the
[40:46] whole whole house so it's it's it's not
[40:49] like there's like a second Bitcoin that
[40:51] is really good and really decentralized
[40:53] and really a competitor uh and I always
[40:56] love a little bit when there is comments
[40:59] saying oh but there there will uh come
[41:01] competition or there is competition to
[41:02] bitcoin I'm like I'm not seeing anything
[41:06] I I literally would not know what I
[41:08] would buy with my Bitcoin today if
[41:10] Bitcoin uh we to fail I really would
[41:13] have a hard time finding out like oh
[41:16] what the heck do I do with my money now
[41:19] yeah yeah I I I don't feel like even
[41:21] even sit coiners like even even people
[41:23] that are like uh uh giving their value
[41:26] and their money to other projects are
[41:29] are going to are going to say any more
[41:32] maybe the serious ones like some silly
[41:35] ones might might try and say that but
[41:38] like I don't feel like even those guys
[41:40] are saying that their project is more
[41:42] decentralized that Bitcoin nothing is
[41:44] more decentralized than Bitcoin and
[41:47] again that doesn't mean that Bitcoin can
[41:50] can be more decentralized it
[41:52] can but I don't feel like there's a
[41:55] project out there that compare here you
[41:58] know 100% yeah um one thing that I kind
[42:02] of forgot to ask you before and I really
[42:04] want to get it in there um what will you
[42:06] do actually once we hit the 100K like
[42:09] are you throwing a a 24hour live stream
[42:12] in there or something something crazy
[42:14] like that oh you got I got to do it 24
[42:17] hours so I don't know I I would love
[42:20] that once once it hits 100K you're doing
[42:24] 24 hour space I I'll when 100K happens
[42:29] whenever uh go God
[42:34] willing um I'll open the last one and
[42:37] the last space I'm going to play the
[42:40] three songs again as I do I'm going to
[42:43] rant in the between as I do and in the
[42:46] end of the third uh song I will uh
[42:51] finally give out the mics I will give
[42:53] out the mics to the dsbs and the big
[42:57] coiners that I have like 50 100 of those
[43:01] guys that really joined like the
[43:04] majority of the spaces that I know we
[43:06] have formed like a a little group that
[43:09] uh is special to me and I will finally
[43:11] give the mics and uh we're going to have
[43:15] fun
[43:17] maybe others would join and
[43:21] uh I don't know we're going to going
[43:24] we're going to have fun we're going to
[43:25] have fun and uh you know I even did this
[43:28] live like uh we did the uh having party
[43:33] in El Salvador with the M factory and I
[43:36] did the those spaces I did it live on
[43:39] stage and I saw those people that were
[43:43] joining every day through the bear
[43:45] Market live down there dancing their ass
[43:48] off and we were like having a blast like
[43:52] so this thing has grew bigger than me
[43:57] for some reason and
[43:59] um yeah the last the last uh space I
[44:02] don't know if it's going to be 24hour
[44:04] space but definitely is going to be a
[44:06] big
[44:08] one what do you mean with giving up the
[44:11] the the mic you're you're starting a new
[44:13] show or like no no until now I haven't
[44:16] given the mic at all it's just me oh so
[44:20] it's till now it's it's just you talking
[44:23] and now it's just me the S is playing I
[44:26] might play some uh
[44:28] audio funny things like uh sailor
[44:31] talking or something over it like meming
[44:34] over with the
[44:37] audio and it's just me ranting basically
[44:41] and saying my opinions in a very angry
[44:46] uh yellow
[44:48] way that's it so in the final one I have
[44:53] promised to especially duari to give out
[44:56] after the three songs is play to give
[44:58] out the mics and get the get those guys
[45:02] up so they can able to talk finally
[45:05] until now they've been talking to me
[45:07] with writing underneath the space
[45:11] tweet it's also form of communication I
[45:14] guess but that's that's great so I would
[45:16] love for you to see the like some sort
[45:19] of show out of that like maybe you can
[45:21] put like the 10 10 20 people from there
[45:24] out and uh maybe you can even do it in
[45:27] some sort of video format I mean with
[45:29] avatars fine would be cool uh to see a a
[45:34] new show because now you did that one
[45:36] show from uh what was it uh 17K 16k to
[45:40] now uh 100K maybe you need a different
[45:45] show now from 100K to 1 million that you
[45:48] keep going till a
[45:52] million yeah someone suggested that and
[45:55] he said you should another space from
[45:58] 100 to a million and play the same song
[46:01] but six times I'm like what are you
[46:03] trying to are you guys trying to kill me
[46:07] come on how long do you think I mean
[46:09] it's everyone's guess and obviously you
[46:12] you you you don't know but what would
[46:15] you guess uh how long would you would
[46:17] that space go from 100K to to a million
[46:20] that's a good question I would say two
[46:21] cycles more like I I I would say like
[46:25] eight eight years seven years
[46:28] years that that's that's uh quite a lot
[46:31] it's like till 2030 2032 something like
[46:35] that yeah yeah something like that 2030
[46:38] 2031 I don't feel like I'm not one of
[46:41] those guys that are saying like right
[46:43] now after we break 100K we're gonna go
[46:47] near 1 million I don't believe
[46:50] that it it it would also not be that
[46:53] good actually I think I think I think
[46:55] it's
[46:57] much it could be negative uh overall for
[47:01] the world if Bitcoin reaches the million
[47:05] in
[47:06] 2025 yeah for me as I said before
[47:10] bitcoin price is kind of the scoreboard
[47:13] of how bad the field system actually
[47:18] does and uh this means if we hit a
[47:23] million that's a huge amount of
[47:27] uh Financial energy that flu into
[47:30] Bitcoin um that's not some some ETFs
[47:34] buying that's like a good amount of form
[47:37] to to go from now to 10x from here in
[47:41] like a year uh that could mean that we
[47:44] have a serious economic crisis going on
[47:47] uh yeah it's I I don't wish that for the
[47:51] world in 2025 yeah also also I don't
[47:54] think that it's good for the adoption in
[47:57] general because like uh if we're GNA
[48:00] have something similar that happened to
[48:02] 2017 with the parabola breaking
[48:06] everything basically like that thing
[48:10] destroyed a lot of
[48:11] people a lot of people like got
[48:15] destroyed by that uh pump that big pump
[48:19] we had back then yes some of them became
[48:22] maximalist and I understood took the
[48:25] message that every I think is vaporware
[48:28] other than uh Bitcoin but most of them
[48:31] uh closed whatever crypto account they
[48:34] had and for them it's all a
[48:39] scum like you know they they became like
[48:42] haters basically they became Peter SI
[48:45] they went to gold or
[48:48] something so yeah it's it's crazy to see
[48:52] yeah because I'm just now seeing uh wait
[48:54] I can I can share that
[48:57] uh because it might might be interesting
[49:00] uh to to compare that um and obviously
[49:04] 206 to 17 is now different till 2024 and
[49:10] 2025 um let me is that the right screen
[49:13] yes
[49:14] share um I just pull it up uh and you
[49:17] see it if we go here now we are in uh
[49:21] November uh so that would be the date
[49:24] and then like end of 2017
[49:28] uh
[49:29] that that are
[49:32] 2,00% uh that's I think a 26 A if if if
[49:36] uh if I know my math now correct that
[49:39] might be wrong but yeah I think around
[49:41] that time um if that happens that would
[49:44] be similar to us
[49:46] hitting um what the 2.6 million end of
[49:52] next
[49:52] [Laughter]
[49:54] year so um I mean it's it's first of all
[49:58] I think it's interesting to see that
[50:00] it's not completely out of the r it's
[50:02] possible um but at the same time I I I
[50:06] don't wish that because um in 2017 the
[50:10] numbers were that much lower overall
[50:12] with the market cap so it means means
[50:15] less than it does mean now um and yeah
[50:20] but 205 I think 100% will be interesting
[50:23] no matter what happens it could be very
[50:26] um very directional um and and and
[50:30] telling year how the how the future is
[50:32] going and how Bitcoin is going and how
[50:35] the feeld currencies are are going I
[50:36] think 2095 would be interesting so I I
[50:39] definitely hope I I can see a show
[50:41] between like you and and maybe 10 20
[50:43] maybe even 50 other people that join
[50:46] every day I would love to see that by
[50:48] the way we are now back at 95 so we oh
[50:52] we almost over 4K away again from the
[50:56] 100k
[50:57] yeah it's okay you know like 100k is
[51:00] like it's not like only
[51:02] psychological like I feel like at 100K
[51:06] there's a change of guards
[51:08] happening the guards are changing up
[51:11] like some of the ogs want in in in some
[51:16] percentage to get out and new ogs
[51:21] especially through ETFs and sailor wants
[51:25] wants to get in and become the guard
[51:28] right so we have a change of of of an
[51:32] Epoch basically from the
[51:35] old um o um um background to the new
[51:42] whales coming in and taking over a
[51:45] little bit more more a bigger percentage
[51:48] of what they they had so I feel like
[51:51] that is happening around
[51:53] 100K and uh I really don't know what
[51:57] will happen after
[51:59] 100K after 100K we might pump like like
[52:03] 50k like
[52:05] nothing but I don't feel like after that
[52:08] we're going to reach like 600k or 1
[52:11] million as some say I don't know at some
[52:14] point that's going to end the crazy pump
[52:18] right and it usually ends very quickly
[52:22] as it
[52:24] started I'm I'm already looking looking
[52:26] forward to the next bare
[52:29] market and and uh having having the
[52:33] calmness to build up for the next bull
[52:35] market uh and see what's what's possible
[52:38] I think uh the the meme of like be
[52:40] market for Builders that that that's a
[52:42] real thing uh and I'm really looking
[52:44] forward to that because never really
[52:46] built anything in Bitcoin in the bare
[52:48] Market uh because CH I kind of join just
[52:50] like this last year uh in it with the
[52:53] podcast and everything so I kind of get
[52:55] to know Bitcoin now
[52:57] um and you touched on it a little bit um
[52:59] this was kind of a next next question
[53:01] for you what what the meaning of of
[53:03] Bitcoin reaching that 100K actually is
[53:07] like what what that means because we
[53:09] were already so close to it it doesn't
[53:11] mean a lot financially like we already
[53:14] like does not you you your life doesn't
[53:17] change if Bitcoin is at like 99k or at
[53:21] 105 probably uh so what is the culture
[53:26] and the the impact of of that 100K is
[53:30] it's some is it something similar than
[53:33] we had with like Crossing that $1 or $10
[53:37] $100 Mark in the early days is it a
[53:40] profound thing for
[53:42] you um to be honest I'm only excited
[53:46] about the 100K just for my thing the dsb
[53:50] other other than that I'm not that
[53:52] excited to be honest like I I said it
[53:55] before that
[53:57] pricewise I don't
[54:00] feel um that that um exatic let's say
[54:05] the the hopium they say you feel right
[54:08] so that's why it makes
[54:12] me it makes me wonder that um this thing
[54:16] is just getting started right now it's
[54:19] not we're not like near the end of some
[54:23] doomsayers say having said that Bitcoin
[54:28] does the exact opposite
[54:31] so having said that in two weeks that
[54:35] this thing is going to play you know
[54:38] we're back in 70s or something it's
[54:41] going to be extremely funny but you know
[54:43] what like I have accepted the shanigan
[54:46] that Bitcoin does in price so I have
[54:49] completely accepted it whatever happens
[54:52] like I will meme around it and I'm going
[54:54] to laugh about it you know because in
[54:57] the end whatever it does it goes up I
[55:00] love it so much
[55:02] it's and I also thought about we're now
[55:05] saying no it will not go to a million no
[55:07] it would be
[55:08] bad maybe end of 2025 and we like 5
[55:12] million and we look back at the space we
[55:15] completely Mis misunderestimated oh
[55:18] yeah yeah that's that's the beauty of
[55:20] Bitcoin
[55:22] man absolutely but it's it's it's such
[55:25] an amazing space
[55:26] to be in uh and and it's it holds you
[55:29] accountable like we we say it on the
[55:31] podcast and I'm 100% sure people will
[55:34] hold us accountable in in one year I
[55:37] will hold myself accountable I'm already
[55:39] um I I made a video on a German channel
[55:42] uh in 2020 explaining Bitcoin and I did
[55:46] not look at that video since
[55:49] 2020 uh and I'm planning on like AI
[55:52] translating it and reacting to it uh and
[55:55] I'm really curious what I said about
[55:56] that in 2020 so that's a big motive also
[55:59] for me to make content because I want to
[56:02] see how accurate I'm I am or how not
[56:05] accurate I am and being publicly
[56:07] accountable for that uh I think it's
[56:09] it's a fun thing to do
[56:11] definitely
[56:13] yeah as long as you as long as we're
[56:16] being
[56:17] honest uh there there is there is no
[56:19] problem for me you know like we're just
[56:22] like trying to figure out like like
[56:24] everyone else trying to figure out and
[56:26] trying to
[56:28] project um where this thing is going to
[56:30] go or not you know and uh as long as
[56:34] you're being uh humble about it as uh
[56:37] Odell says and uh acknowledge that in
[56:40] the end Bitcoin is will do what Bitcoin
[56:43] wants to
[56:44] do H yeah then you're good stack stats
[56:49] and and stay humble I love that Meme
[56:50] from Mell it's really really good
[56:53] perfect before we come to the our end
[56:54] routine um I also was recently in El
[56:57] Salvador you mentioned that you were
[56:59] there before the Haring party how do you
[57:01] like the developments down there and how
[57:05] is how is elad for
[57:07] you oh it was amazing I spent like a
[57:10] month there I uh pretty much went around
[57:13] all over uh Berlin Alon the coast lines
[57:18] the lake uh Lake
[57:22] combo combo something like that uh s
[57:27] Salvador I love the I love the I love El
[57:31] Salvador um if you're willing to do the
[57:34] trip because for me it was a long trip
[57:37] 21
[57:39] hours um yeah if you're going to do that
[57:42] you have to spend at least like a month
[57:44] and uh go around I still didn't go south
[57:47] where I saw good thing also like uh near
[57:50] the coast south to
[57:54] Guatemala uh it's an amazing in place
[57:56] very friendly people uh very
[58:00] safe uh with
[58:03] um uh a lot of constructions going on
[58:07] everywhere you walk uh in the corner
[58:10] something is being
[58:12] built and uh you know like the
[58:15] construction is going crazy it reminds
[58:17] me of Greece back back in the 90s where
[58:19] everything was like building as crazy
[58:22] their houses or something around tourism
[58:26] and
[58:27] uh uh also I also liked that
[58:32] um there's something for everyone like
[58:34] if you want to go to the more luxurious
[58:38] let's say
[58:39] hotels that exist down the shore of elz
[58:44] and Elco but if you want to find
[58:47] something more
[58:49] cheap you can also find that like
[58:52] whatever you want
[58:54] right and uh yeah the food is great the
[58:58] people are great yeah there's a there's
[59:02] a lot of heat around the coast other
[59:05] than that if you like up just a little
[59:07] bit up in the mountains or even like in
[59:09] the capital the the weather is way
[59:13] better I like the S Salvador v a
[59:17] lot is a little bit too hum for me yeah
[59:21] and so and so I remember I was getting
[59:24] out of my
[59:26] shout out to Carlos in uh in the Beats
[59:31] umon so I was I was going out from my
[59:34] room and I was starting like sweating
[59:36] right away like after two two steps I
[59:40] was sweating and I was like H okay this
[59:43] is like kind of annoying but after after
[59:46] a while I feel like you get used to that
[59:48] even that uh but for sure the weather up
[59:52] in San Salvador and uh I got an air
[59:56] being in the lake next to it the
[59:59] lateo I don't remember exactly the name
[60:02] so uh the weather there was perfect so
[60:06] it was way cooler it was up in the
[60:10] mountains and uh yeah it was one of the
[60:13] best days I spent in
[60:15] Salvador with friends I I think I know
[60:19] which lake you mean let me quickly share
