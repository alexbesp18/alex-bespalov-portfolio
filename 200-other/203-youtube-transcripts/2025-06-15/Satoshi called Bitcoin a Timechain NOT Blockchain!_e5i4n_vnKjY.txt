[00:00] in the white paper Satoshi doesn't use
[00:02] the word blockchain anymore in his early
[00:04] writings it is referred to as a Time
[00:05] chain you go back one year or 10 years
[00:08] into the chain these things are
[00:09] unchangeable there's a Time chain
[00:12] there's a chain of events in time that
[00:16] sequence is Inc consensus it is
[00:18] immutable it is authoritative so now
[00:21] anyone who uses Bitcoin anyone who runs
[00:24] a node or who does a transaction on
[00:26] chain they are beholden to this sequence
[00:29] of events that they cannot change it's a
[00:32] truth it's powerful in the sense that it
[00:34] cannot be manipulated in the way that
[00:36] you know all other things in human world
[00:39] seem to be able to be manipulated a new
[00:41] type of way to track these moments that
[00:44] pass as a global Consciousness that
[00:47] that's what a block height is it's
[00:49] literally a particular moment in time
[00:51] regardless of where you are on the
[00:52] planet that we can all agree upon good
[00:54] morning unpredictable future good
[00:57] morning immutable past it could take 1
[01:00] second and somebody could find the block
[01:01] it could take 2 hours or more for
[01:03] somebody to find the block and no one
[01:05] knows as you learn more about Bitcoin
[01:07] you are exposed to more truths you learn
[01:10] truth about the Legacy money system you
[01:13] learn truth about Banking and how really
[01:16] the strings of Power are pulled in the
[01:18] world and that could be a very painful
[01:20] thing for
[01:22] [Music]
[01:25] people why not blockchain why is it a
[01:29] Time
[01:31] chain hey well thank you that that's a
[01:33] that's a great question and it's uh it's
[01:36] something that's very meaningful to me
[01:39] um you know in the in the white paper
[01:42] Satoshi doesn't use the word blockchain
[01:45] anywhere in his early writings it is
[01:48] referred to as a Time chain and I feel
[01:50] like time is
[01:52] the really kind of important thread that
[01:56] runs through so much of what is
[01:59] important about Bitcoin um if you look
[02:02] at human history we have all these
[02:06] different
[02:08] documents uh in different parts of the
[02:10] world from different cultures and
[02:12] societies and you know today Looking
[02:15] Backward we we have you know very
[02:18] different uh points of view about
[02:20] history and what has occurred it's
[02:22] almost like the record of of uh
[02:25] importance is not a it's not a consensus
[02:28] it's something that is broken and
[02:30] fragmented and gets changed over time
[02:33] you look at certain documents that have
[02:35] lived on and it's not the original
[02:38] document that you're looking at you're
[02:39] looking at a copy of a copy of a
[02:41] translation of a copy of a translation
[02:44] this kind of thing so with Bitcoin to me
[02:47] when I think of the word time chain I
[02:50] think of this
[02:52] authoritative sequence those the
[02:55] important words for me it's uh it's a
[02:59] Rec record that
[03:02] is in consensus and in such it's it's
[03:06] immutable it cannot be changed you
[03:09] cannot go back into the history of
[03:13] Bitcoin
[03:14] transactions and change it now the the
[03:18] caveat on that is the the very tip of
[03:20] the chain is being competed over and
[03:24] there's times actually almost every day
[03:27] we we have uh these very small small uh
[03:31] differences of the tip of the chain and
[03:33] but that gets reconciled as more blocks
[03:36] get added uh it becomes increasingly
[03:39] difficult to change uh a block that's
[03:42] older that has more blocks on top of it
[03:45] you know a lot of exchanges will require
[03:47] six confirmations that's six blocks
[03:50] after the block with the transaction in
[03:52] it uh and and that's basically because
[03:55] of this nature of how difficult it is to
[03:58] change something as it becomes deeper in
[04:00] the chain so you go back one year or 10
[04:02] years into the chain these things are
[04:05] unchangeable so we have right there
[04:09] there's a Time chain there's a chain of
[04:14] events in time that
[04:16] sequence is in consensus it is immutable
[04:21] it is authoritative so now anyone who
[04:23] uses Bitcoin anyone who runs a node or
[04:27] who does a transaction on chain
[04:30] they are beholden to this sequence of
[04:34] events that they cannot change it's a
[04:37] truth it is uh it is it's powerful in
[04:40] the sense that it cannot be manipulated
[04:43] in the way that you know all other
[04:46] things in human world seem to be able to
[04:48] be manipulated now I feel like there's a
[04:50] lot of examples of revision of history
[04:54] that happens in our society people have
[04:57] a hard time agreeing upon things that
[04:59] happen
[05:00] just recently you know uh just even a
[05:03] year or so ago and uh you in Bitcoin We
[05:06] have basically something that is just um
[05:10] really a different kind of History
[05:12] that's unfolding here and I feel like
[05:14] it's um so uh significant in human
[05:18] history that that we have now a way to
[05:21] record something that is
[05:25] unchangeable and and
[05:27] true that's a that's a very interesting
[05:31] point because when we look at what what
[05:35] what all the history has been done and
[05:38] everything uh has been there for for the
[05:40] dawn of time um there's never been
[05:45] something that cannot really be changed
[05:48] by someone else like I I could not
[05:52] figure out like I could not find any
[05:54] comparison to what we have now it's
[05:57] digital um it cannot really be destroyed
[06:00] like you kind of have to destroy the
[06:02] internet and all the planet uh and the
[06:06] whole whole earth to really destroy
[06:08] Bitcoin because there could be in some
[06:11] sense anywhere like in some room laptop
[06:14] that still keeps it running um so you
[06:17] really have to really destroy the planet
[06:20] uh if you want to destroy it uh which is
[06:23] very un like unlikely to happen um what
[06:28] what does this mean for for for us for
[06:30] as a society as as as the human species
[06:34] um that we now finally have something we
[06:36] can truly rely on like this this thing
[06:38] will not
[06:40] change well I I I personally believe
[06:44] that right now the world that we live in
[06:47] is
[06:47] so uh impacted
[06:50] by uh information and so much of it is
[06:53] not true and people are struggling with
[06:56] that and we have conflicts in in societ
[07:00] uh people don't agree about what's real
[07:04] now we have ai it's almost like we're
[07:06] living in a a posttruth world and
[07:09] depending which News Channel that you
[07:12] get your news from depending Which
[07:17] social media you follow depending what
[07:20] you see and experience out in the world
[07:23] you can have a wildly different
[07:25] understanding of what is actually
[07:26] happening and so this is very very
[07:29] important
[07:30] so to me it's not that Bitcoin literally
[07:34] solves everything but how significant is
[07:37] it that we have now this one thing this
[07:41] we can we can point to the utxo set of
[07:45] Bitcoin and every person on the planet
[07:48] can see the same truth and it's
[07:52] independently verifiable and any person
[07:55] can go and see it themselves and know
[07:58] themselves that that is true and they're
[08:00] seeing the same truth everyone else is
[08:02] seeing maybe this is the beginning of
[08:05] something new maybe this is the the
[08:07] foundation layer on which uh Society can
[08:11] kind of evolve and people can start to
[08:15] um move forward with at least some
[08:18] common knowledge at least about this
[08:20] utxo set we can agree what is true I
[08:24] feel like that's that's
[08:25] significant that's very significant
[08:27] that's it's like um
[08:30] I made uh a small group for my channel
[08:33] members just so we we can talk about
[08:35] stuff uh and when something happened
[08:39] some event happened I I don't remember
[08:40] what it was actually uh but it happened
[08:43] the event we did it uh and then right
[08:47] afterwards someone just said for
[08:49] documentation reason for document
[08:51] reasons and then uh the the current
[08:55] block so we can actually uh then look
[08:59] back oh this was a de block when we spin
[09:01] this F further and more and more humans
[09:05] actually adopt it because right now it's
[09:06] like a very very small group of people
[09:09] like when you go on the street and ask
[09:11] the people what is the time chain I
[09:13] don't know how many people even uh could
[09:16] could do something with that that term
[09:19] and could link it to bitcoin I think
[09:21] when you you ask people like is Bitcoin
[09:23] and time chin connected I think most
[09:25] people uh outside of the Bitcoin sphere
[09:28] would would say that how they connected
[09:30] I don't know it's I only know blockchain
[09:33] um also interesting point that sadori
[09:35] actually named the time chain in the
[09:36] original thing and it's never mentioned
[09:39] anything from blockchain I never heard
[09:41] that but uh it's it's it's interesting
[09:44] that you actually never do that but when
[09:47] we stay this F and we spin that uh
[09:49] further is it possible uh or how do you
[09:53] imagine that that it's possible that we
[09:56] only have Bitcoin as a measurement if of
[09:59] time like is a measurement of events as
[10:02] a meas as a measurement of like oh let's
[10:05] let's uh meet that that and that PL uh
[10:09] do do you think that's possible or or
[10:13] how can it be
[10:14] possible yeah I mean this is where it
[10:16] gets really interesting because uh we
[10:19] actually have this experience within
[10:21] Bitcoin within the the population that
[10:24] pays attention to bitcoin you know we
[10:26] just had a we just had a having we had
[10:28] the the fourth having entering Epoch 5
[10:32] that was back in April it was on the
[10:35] 20th of April or the 19th of April
[10:38] depending which time zone you're in but
[10:41] everyone who was paying attention to
[10:44] this was very closely watching the block
[10:47] height and waiting for block 840,000
[10:51] and that
[10:53] moment was experienced by everyone
[10:56] across the globe at the same time so
[10:58] there's something very powerful about a
[11:02] block time the the actual time stamp and
[11:06] the block height of a specific block is
[11:09] actually a very unique way to
[11:13] experience time as a global human race
[11:18] right a lot of things that we put
[11:20] meaning in get experienced in sort of
[11:23] waves across time zones think of New
[11:25] Year's Eve going into New Year's Day and
[11:28] we have the countdown and fireworks but
[11:31] that gets experienced one time zone at a
[11:34] time so it's like the world is sliced up
[11:37] into these different groups based on
[11:39] time zone and we experience that event
[11:42] over a 24-hour period whereas the having
[11:45] block and every other Block in Bitcoin
[11:48] is experienced in the same moment
[11:51] globally so we have here an example of
[11:54] of a new type of uh way to track these
[12:00] moments that pass as a global
[12:03] Consciousness that that's what a block
[12:05] height is it's literally a particular
[12:07] moment in time regardless of where you
[12:09] are on the planet that we can all agree
[12:12] upon and have a way of marking through
[12:15] the time chain we can point to specific
[12:17] blocks and we're talking about specific
[12:19] moments in time so when I say my child
[12:22] was born on this block height that's
[12:25] more specific and also more of a
[12:29] consensus moment than just saying a date
[12:33] on the calendar because of course I say
[12:36] that date on the calendar I'm in West
[12:39] Coast North America somebody who's in
[12:42] Australia says no it's not that date
[12:44] it's this state because they're one day
[12:46] in the future according to the the
[12:49] traditional calendar and so this
[12:52] actually is very interesting this is
[12:53] where I started to come upon this idea
[12:56] of the time chain calendar is that
[13:00] I believe that this time chain uh really
[13:03] functions like a calendar it's a unique
[13:06] type of calender each of these blocks is
[13:09] a globally experienced simultaneous
[13:12] moment of the entire human race and you
[13:15] have much more fine
[13:18] grain uh
[13:21] specificity and as far as a block height
[13:24] versus just a day you have on average
[13:27] 144 blocks each day so it's like taking
[13:30] a 24-hour period and finding 144 unique
[13:34] moments within that time frame and
[13:37] that's how much more specific you can be
[13:39] and so in a lot of ways this is really
[13:42] uh an incredible new system of marking
[13:45] time now you also mentioned can we meet
[13:47] at a specific block and anyone who was
[13:50] watching for the having had had this
[13:52] experience of wool we don't know exactly
[13:54] when this block is coming but we have a
[13:57] general idea and of course as time
[13:59] as as we get closer to that block it
[14:01] becomes easier to estimate um people who
[14:04] were planning parties for instance for
[14:06] the having who had to plan it six months
[14:08] in advance they have a much harder task
[14:11] knowing what day that's going to happen
[14:13] on so it's there's some interesting
[14:15] topics there around the calendar and how
[14:17] blocks relate to this timekeeping aspect
[14:20] of
[14:23] humans that's
[14:25] interesting because like it's it's for
[14:28] me like you cannot predict exactly when
[14:31] this Haring will be like you have to
[14:34] look a little bit in the future and
[14:36] there were some debates oh would it be
[14:37] on the 21st of April 19 of April all
[14:41] those debates uh and it was on different
[14:44] days for for different people um and but
[14:49] when we only have the time
[14:52] chain then there are no debates about
[14:55] that right it's like it's just it's it's
[14:58] just just a Time CH then uh or is it's
[15:03] like when we actually it's like there's
[15:05] this this thing like before Jesus Christ
[15:08] and after Jesus Christ with the the
[15:10] calendar um and I never went really deep
[15:14] in the rabbit hole of the time chain uh
[15:16] but I could
[15:19] imagine um when we have a thing that we
[15:22] all of the can agree on and I know it
[15:24] because I have
[15:27] a an everyday podcast where I meet with
[15:32] so many different people um from all
[15:35] over the world like there's Australia in
[15:37] there there's America in there there's
[15:39] India in there there's Europe in there
[15:42] so this this this time zone thing is a
[15:46] real mess and then you send the time
[15:49] zone oh but it's Australian time in
[15:52] Australia there's also three or four
[15:54] different time zones um so you really
[15:56] have to get like specific and
[15:59] yeah Technologies like Google Calendar
[16:02] take a lot of the heavy lifting you just
[16:04] like send out a link and they can book
[16:07] it and it's shown correctly in their
[16:09] calendar and is shown correctly in our
[16:12] calendar um but there's something
[16:14] magical to having something Global
[16:18] something unifying because if I say like
[16:20] oh I'm born at this day at this time
[16:24] this is only true if I'm staying in my
[16:28] time zone
[16:29] if I'm moving my time zone just a little
[16:31] bit I have to correct myself I have to
[16:34] like oh no I'm I'm actually born in this
[16:36] one I have to give extra context to our
[16:39] timing system yes it it's from my it's
[16:42] it's fascinating for me that um uh we we
[16:45] had a system that we have do so many
[16:48] context things and also like daylight
[16:50] savings time and all those interesting
[16:52] things then we like oh how do we uh
[16:56] Define then when when let's make the the
[16:59] switch like there's actually time chain
[17:02] uh how do we then uh Define a day or
[17:05] something like that how do we have an
[17:08] then a thing that's that's above like a
[17:11] second layer to the time chain where we
[17:13] then have it in our language like oh we
[17:15] meet at the morning of that block or
[17:18] whatever yeah I mean what what's
[17:20] interesting is the traditional
[17:23] time-based systems are all
[17:27] establishing a system of
[17:29] measuring
[17:31] uh the the heavenly bodies and movements
[17:34] you know a day is the earth rotating
[17:38] once relative to the Sun and then a year
[17:43] is the Earth
[17:44] orbiting Once Around the Sun so we have
[17:49] here these cycles that are repeating and
[17:54] a traditional calendar is a way of
[17:56] trying to
[18:00] measure that and then predict into the
[18:03] future based on that system of measuring
[18:06] what's really interesting to me I went
[18:07] down a calendar Rabbit Hole um in the
[18:10] last couple years and I I learned about
[18:13] how many times the calendar system has
[18:15] changed we take for granted the days of
[18:17] the week um how many days are in each
[18:21] month and how many months or in a year
[18:23] but that's not been the same throughout
[18:25] history it's changed many times and it's
[18:27] because was as soon as humans have come
[18:30] up with a system of measuring it and
[18:32] then they cast it forward and now
[18:34] they're looking at their system and
[18:36] looking at the actual Sun and the Earth
[18:38] and its actual movements and saying oops
[18:41] we're off the calendar is not measuring
[18:44] it correctly and that's where we end up
[18:46] with kind of this goofy system we have
[18:48] today it's just been tinkered with and
[18:51] adjusted guarantee you if we you know
[18:54] continue existing on this planet 100 200
[18:58] a, years in the future will probably
[19:00] have an adjustment still it'll be
[19:02] different again from the current system
[19:05] of months and uh uh days and and and
[19:09] this measurement and you know as you
[19:11] start getting down the fine grain
[19:12] measurement of the time zones and you
[19:15] need daylight savings changes and all
[19:17] these sort of funny quirks in order to
[19:20] make that system work now with with
[19:23] Bitcoin with the time chain it's it's
[19:27] fascinating to me that there's a there's
[19:29] a
[19:31] paradox depending which direction you're
[19:33] looking so you know I have a little good
[19:35] morning message on time chain calendar
[19:38] every morning there's a little button
[19:40] that says GM and if you click it it
[19:42] gives you a little good morning message
[19:45] uh there's about 30 or so messages and
[19:47] it randomly picks one each day and those
[19:49] will change over time but one of the
[19:51] messages I say there is I say good
[19:53] morning unpredictable future good
[19:56] morning immutable past and this is the
[19:59] nature of the time chain the past is
[20:02] immutable we know exactly which moment
[20:05] every block has occurred and the
[20:07] sequence of those moments is
[20:09] unchangeable but the next block it is
[20:13] uncertain we don't know exactly when
[20:14] it's coming it come in 1 second it could
[20:16] take two hours or more there's this
[20:20] deterministic random nature to when the
[20:22] blocks come and this is part of the
[20:24] design of the system so it really is
[20:26] fundamentally a very different Timing
[20:29] System if we look at it and we compare
[20:30] it to a calendar um because of that
[20:33] nature the future is unknown even though
[20:37] you know one of my favorite things there
[20:39] Gigi said is he said that the the proper
[20:42] guess for when in the next block is
[20:43] coming it's always 10 minutes doesn't
[20:46] matter if it's been 1 second or one hour
[20:49] since the previous block the next block
[20:51] if you have to guess when it is the best
[20:53] guess is 10 minutes it's a it's a funny
[20:55] thing it starts getting into statistics
[20:57] and probability and you know these kinds
[21:00] of philosophies of how to look at things
[21:04] but ultimately for the for the the the
[21:09] way for the average person to just wrap
[21:10] their head around it is it's a random
[21:12] and unpredictable going forward we we
[21:15] know that the system suggests and wants
[21:18] and targets 10-minute block time and
[21:20] based on that we predict into the future
[21:23] but of course according
[21:25] to when the blocks happen and get added
[21:29] to the chain looking
[21:31] backwards you can you know continue to
[21:34] kind of update that and so whenever I
[21:36] look at a block right now on time chain
[21:37] calendar is 24 minutes since the last
[21:39] block so I could say yeah the next
[21:42] Block's coming any second now it's late
[21:44] or I could say yeah well probably it's
[21:47] going to be somewhere about 10 minutes
[21:49] from now just it's it's a funny thing it
[21:51] it kind of
[21:52] challenges our our desire as a human to
[21:56] want everything to be predictable to
[21:57] want everything be even um yeah I think
[22:02] there's some very interesting thoughts
[22:03] there is it similar to like from a
[22:07] technical and and from a statistical
[22:09] standpoint is it similar to uh having
[22:12] dices like when you for
[22:14] example I I when I Dice from it's like
[22:18] one to six is the possibilities I dice
[22:20] it and I dice 10 times in a row and 10
[22:25] times in a row it was always one or two
[22:29] two the probability is the same at the
[22:32] 11th one uh for one 2 3 four five six to
[22:38] occur even though I my my brain is like
[22:42] if there's only one and two then like
[22:47] there very high probability that there
[22:49] might now come a three four five or six
[22:53] yeah but every dice is a new one every
[22:56] dice is is a new game is that similar
[22:59] Mechanics for for new block exactly so
[23:02] as soon as a block is added to the chain
[23:06] all of the miners are mining on the next
[23:09] block well at least they should be
[23:11] because if they're still mining on the
[23:13] previous block they're going to be
[23:15] disappointed if they get lucky and hit
[23:17] um so yeah what's happening as soon as a
[23:19] new block
[23:20] comes and everyone's node is notified
[23:25] and made aware of that new block and
[23:27] they're in ensus all the people trying
[23:30] to mine the next block must be mining on
[23:33] top of that most recent block and the
[23:35] whole competition starts again and it's
[23:38] entirely random it could take one second
[23:40] and somebody could find the block it
[23:43] could take two hours or more for
[23:45] somebody to find the block and no one
[23:47] knows and this is a really important
[23:49] thing I mean this is very intentional
[23:51] designed by Satoshi about how this
[23:53] system should work because this comes to
[23:55] the fairness of Bitcoin like the system
[23:59] cannot be perceived as Fair unless we
[24:02] don't know who the next block is going
[24:05] to be Mind by that's important because
[24:08] the blocks every single block has two
[24:11] major functions that it does one is it
[24:15] confirms transactions it adds
[24:17] transactions to the chain we've added
[24:20] some new changes in where the utxos are
[24:23] and the state of where all the utxos is
[24:26] updated that's one thing it does the
[24:28] other important things it does is a new
[24:30] block Issues new Bitcoin Supply right
[24:34] now we have 3.125 Bitcoin per block and
[24:39] every time there's a new block we just
[24:40] hit a new block while I was speaking
[24:42] that sentence uh we so 3.125 more
[24:46] Bitcoin exist just now than when I
[24:48] started that sentence um so that's the
[24:50] other thing is that we don't know who
[24:53] the
[24:55] next uh new Bitcoin will be issued to
[24:58] the last block was just mined by Foundry
[25:00] USA but uh we don't we didn't know that
[25:03] was going to be much better and it's
[25:05] important that we don't know for sure
[25:07] who it's going to be mined by and so
[25:09] this is a very important aspect of
[25:11] Bitcoin this Randomness this
[25:13] deterministic nature of who is going to
[25:16] get the next block and that's the
[25:18] importance of Bitcoin mining even if
[25:20] anyone's just interested in Bitcoin or
[25:22] you just huddle a little bit of Bitcoin
[25:25] if you don't mine you don't really
[25:27] understand mining it's important to know
[25:29] that the mining is a really critical
[25:32] part of bitcoin's system being fair and
[25:36] it it also is uh very important to the
[25:39] security but um yeah in the context of
[25:41] the time chain that's that's what's
[25:43] Happening Here is the next block is uh
[25:47] uncertain although if you had to bet
[25:50] you'd say 10
[25:51] minutes
[25:53] um will that be more predictable in like
[25:58] like 20 years when the
[26:00] mining infrastructure is is just bigger
[26:04] and and will Bitcoin then be more
[26:07] predictable in in times of like in in in
[26:12] in all like it will always be kind of
[26:14] the same like this 10 minutes thing will
[26:17] be way more predictable it will not be
[26:19] two hours it's it's big news if it's
[26:21] like 13 minutes or 15 minutes no no I I
[26:26] think that we're always going to have
[26:27] this Rand omness and so you're always
[26:30] going to have blocks that happen super
[26:32] fast and other blocks that take a very
[26:34] long time what is possible to be more
[26:38] predictable about and actually it's a
[26:39] problem with Bitcoin is if we know who's
[26:42] going to win the next block I mentioned
[26:44] Foundry one the last block as we were
[26:46] speaking and it's a problem if we can
[26:50] predict hey Foundry or ant pool or one
[26:53] of these big pools is going to win every
[26:55] block that's a problem we just hit
[26:57] another block just as I was speaking
[26:59] there I'm watching the time chain
[27:01] calendar as we're talking hey look at
[27:03] that minded by antpool that's a little
[27:06] bit spooky okay so you know this points
[27:09] to problems with centralization in
[27:12] mining um that's the only thing that we
[27:15] that we're going to unfortunately if
[27:18] mining continues to centralize we will
[27:20] be more predictable regarding the blocks
[27:22] as we will at some point say you know uh
[27:26] most of the blocks are going to be mined
[27:27] by small handful of Miners and that's
[27:31] that's a problem in in Bitcoin as far as
[27:34] centralization uh long-term anyone who
[27:38] loves Bitcoin and cares about it wants
[27:39] to see less centralization and and more
[27:43] diverse group of miners competing over
[27:46] that's a whole another
[27:48] topic but do you see it as a a solvable
[27:53] Sol solvable problem that because it's
[27:57] like there has two
[27:58] there there are a lot of arguments to it
[28:00] first of all like I'm really glad that
[28:03] uh China fought against mining in 2021 I
[28:07] think it was uh so there is not as much
[28:12] mining hash rate now in China than it
[28:14] was before a lot less I think now it's
[28:16] like 10 20% maybe uh I don't know the
[28:19] exact numbers and nobody can know the
[28:21] exact numbers but those are the guesses
[28:24] um and before I saw numbers up to like
[28:27] 70%
[28:28] uh I don't know how exactly and how uh
[28:32] good the numbers were but in kind of of
[28:35] a sense it is way more decentralized but
[28:38] the mining pools then centralized the
[28:42] the system again and yeah we should not
[28:44] go too deep in into that because it's a
[28:46] whole whole not a podcast in itself but
[28:49] do you see it as a solvable problem uh
[28:52] or is it a problem when mining pools are
[28:55] very centralized but nodes are very
[28:58] decentralized still and the miners
[29:00] itself the physical miners are very
[29:03] decentralized all over the
[29:06] world yeah I mean it is a problem this
[29:08] is at a high level it it's a problem as
[29:11] far as you know those two important
[29:14] things that I said every block achieves
[29:17] uh one is who is the new Bitcoin going
[29:20] to be distributed to right so every
[29:23] block 3.125 Bitcoin uh who does that go
[29:26] to if you have fewer people who are
[29:30] actually submitting the blocks then you
[29:33] have fewer people in control of that new
[29:35] Supply you know the assumption is is
[29:37] people who are mining with a pool are
[29:39] going to get a piece of that but you
[29:42] know as it turns out the the pools
[29:45] especially the large ones are incredibly
[29:47] opaque about how they divide up that
[29:51] Bitcoin and um so there's there's a lot
[29:54] that's sort of um problematic about that
[29:58] H if you go into a future where there's
[30:00] even fewer of those pools um that are
[30:04] controlling the vast majority of the the
[30:06] block rewards and then the other thing
[30:08] is the other important thing that every
[30:10] block does is it confirms transactions
[30:12] and the the winning minor gets to choose
[30:15] which transactions to put into that
[30:17] block so of course there that's another
[30:19] problem is that if you have fewer pools
[30:23] you have fewer people deciding which
[30:25] transactions are going to get added to
[30:27] this time change
[30:28] and so as you have fewer people choosing
[30:32] which transaction comes in there's more
[30:35] possibility for problems around uh
[30:39] regulations that come in in different
[30:41] jurisdictions that maybe say we demand
[30:45] that you don't put these transactions in
[30:47] we demand that you put these ones in
[30:49] instead um you know a lot of minors left
[30:53] China but there's a lot of minors now in
[30:54] the United States and depending on uh
[30:58] what the intentions of regulators are um
[31:02] a lot of these large scale miners uh are
[31:06] susceptible to political influence and
[31:08] and actual legal influence and now you
[31:12] have a larger percentage of the Block's
[31:14] mind that could potentially
[31:17] be you know interfered with on a
[31:20] regulatory or legal level um so they it
[31:23] starts getting problematic there's
[31:25] there's a lot of problems with
[31:26] centralization and Mining um and it is a
[31:29] whole another sort of rabbit hole to go
[31:31] down but yeah we want we want basically
[31:34] more mining pools we want more people um
[31:39] determining what transactions are going
[31:41] to go into the blocks and more different
[31:43] possible recipients for those
[31:46] block but it's also a very good point
[31:48] because whenever I watch um Bitcoin
[31:52] versus xyc uh debate the AR arents that
[31:58] come up in those debates against Bitcoin
[32:01] are so
[32:02] weak yeah and I'm always thinking like
[32:05] there can be some at least good
[32:08] arguments like for example always I'm
[32:11] always thinking that the the bitcoiners
[32:13] who hold a lot of Bitcoin in in terms of
[32:16] their net worth um they are the most
[32:21] critical people against Bitcoin usually
[32:24] like they they are the best critics of
[32:26] of Bitcoin the Bitcoin is itself they
[32:29] which hold a high percentage of their
[32:30] net worth in Bitcoin and those who don't
[32:35] obviously don't because they didn't do
[32:37] their homework so this is an interesting
[32:39] point because this is an alleged
[32:40] argument and it's it's something that is
[32:44] um uh
[32:45] explainable and uh it's it's it's one
[32:48] concern or one question that we have
[32:51] around Bitcoin uh I I don't fear it uh I
[32:55] I still think this is like the best
[32:57] thing ever
[32:58] uh but it could run into a problem and
[33:00] we have to be aware of that and and
[33:02] that's what's so great about uh actual
[33:04] bitcoiners who actually did the homework
[33:07] they they're not closing their eyes like
[33:11] I often I hear that oh bitcoiners you
[33:13] you're so closed minded or you are like
[33:16] not open to news no we like bitcoiners
[33:19] are the actually ones that that are the
[33:20] open ones that they actually look
[33:22] critical at Bitcoin yeah that's so true
[33:26] and and I think that you see that
[33:28] because bitcoiners understand Bitcoin
[33:31] better than people outside of Bitcoin
[33:32] and they do care deeply about it maybe
[33:35] because they're so heavily invested they
[33:38] they should care about it um but the
[33:41] point is is that uh you you want to
[33:44] actually learn how these things work and
[33:46] then you find out that um the issues are
[33:49] more
[33:50] nuanced um there are concerns there are
[33:54] problems but Bitcoin has had challenges
[33:56] from day one and that's what it does
[33:59] that's why we we have the mascot of the
[34:02] honey badger because Bitcoin is uh very
[34:05] resilient antifragile and it and it does
[34:10] uh evolve and over time it it clearly
[34:15] overcomes the challenges that come its
[34:18] way uh it's it's not perfect but it
[34:22] absolutely um that has these sort of
[34:24] gain
[34:25] theoretical uh uh sort of
[34:28] characteristics where when you get to a
[34:31] certain problem sometimes the game
[34:33] theory
[34:34] just provides the solution so in the
[34:37] case of you know China pushed hard
[34:39] against Mining and a lot of mining
[34:42] popped up in in other jurisdictions as a
[34:45] result of that and I think that's going
[34:46] to continue to happen um I think we do
[34:49] have to keep these conversations going
[34:51] though people do need to be aware
[34:53] Bitcoin is not perfect and it's going to
[34:55] need people championing the right things
[34:59] and uh continuing to build and
[35:01] continuing to uh create Solutions where
[35:04] there are these
[35:06] problems and it's it's it's great uh to
[35:11] to be in that Community because they are
[35:14] there's like first of all like when you
[35:16] say uh stupid stuff and you say
[35:19] something that is just BS you actually
[35:22] got get called out like um I said that I
[35:25] think two times or three times already
[35:27] in the podcast I came into Bitcoin I was
[35:30] already all in in Bitcoin but I didn't
[35:33] understand Bitcoin to its fullest
[35:35] potential I I think nobody ever does but
[35:38] um I really was far away from
[35:41] understanding the freedom go up
[35:42] technology from Bitcoin I came into
[35:45] Bitcoin Twitter
[35:46] 2023 and I started to interact with just
[35:49] Bitcoin on on Twitter and uh a lot of
[35:53] the times this toxic behavior of of B
[35:57] bitcoiners as as some call it I don't
[36:00] call it toxic I mean some are toxic but
[36:02] most is not toxic um it actually um
[36:07] leted me do question a lot of things and
[36:09] actually guided me to uh do the actual
[36:14] bitcoiner to being an actual bitcoiner
[36:17] there's no such a thing as an actual
[36:18] bitcoiner but do do actually understand
[36:22] um what Bitcoin is to actually
[36:24] understand the freedom Go technology the
[36:25] censorship resistance and why Bitcoin is
[36:28] so important outside of oh wow I get
[36:31] wealthy so which is an important
[36:34] marketing Tool uh but the the aspect of
[36:38] it being a freedom technology uh and
[36:42] also really interest important in terms
[36:44] of of privacy and we can talk about that
[36:47] especially as as you also Anonymous here
[36:49] on the podcast today um that's what what
[36:54] Bitcoin Twitter kind of guided me
[36:57] towards uh and I love that I love that
[37:01] Bitcoin Twitter was not like ah yeah
[37:04] let's let's let him talk no they I came
[37:06] in and they said their things and they
[37:09] were direct and they were honest and
[37:11] they were uh shooting H and they love
[37:14] that some some people say I don't know
[37:16] it's it's um it's it's a turnoff for for
[37:19] newes and enormous and I agree yeah if
[37:21] if you come only Bitcoin TT and you
[37:23] you're not heavily invested in Bitcoin
[37:26] uh or you're not uh you might been
[37:28] turned off by the Bitcoin Twitter
[37:30] Community uh but I like it that way I
[37:33] like that Bitcoin Twitter is like that
[37:35] or Bitcoin axe if we call it like that
[37:38] yeah I I mean I think you have to have
[37:41] an open mind you have to be
[37:43] intellectually honest at least as far as
[37:47] if you have a certain idea and somebody
[37:51] refutes that idea or pushes back and
[37:53] gives you the maybe the correction um it
[37:57] it's
[37:58] human nature sometimes to get defensive
[38:01] and argue or turn away and run away from
[38:04] that but I think this runs into
[38:06] something else that we see all the time
[38:09] in society today which is the truth
[38:11] hurts you know and because we're living
[38:14] in this posttruth world if you build up
[38:17] too much of a sense of comfort because
[38:21] of false information and then you're
[38:23] confronted with something real something
[38:25] true it could actually be very painful
[38:29] uh so that's that's the challenge and I
[38:32] think this is one of the most powerful
[38:33] things about Bitcoin is that as you
[38:35] learn more about Bitcoin you you are
[38:39] exposed to more truths you learn truth
[38:42] about the Legacy money system you learn
[38:45] truth about Banking and how really the
[38:49] strings of Power are pulled in the world
[38:51] and that could be a very painful thing
[38:53] for people because I know myself grow
[38:57] growing up in America as a I remember
[38:59] being a little boy and learning these
[39:03] stories and mythology about my country
[39:08] and about it's about freedom and it's
[39:10] about equality and it's about uh you
[39:13] know Justice and you have this sort of
[39:15] Mythology that you learn about the place
[39:17] you live and then as you grow up as an
[39:20] adult you like having this experience
[39:23] why why is this so different than what I
[39:25] thought it would be why is this so
[39:26] difficult life can feel um very uh
[39:30] frustrating and you're bumping into the
[39:33] truth you're bumping into the reality
[39:35] Bitcoin just rips down the curtain it
[39:38] just says let's let's go right to the
[39:40] root and see what's real and what's not
[39:43] real and that is a process I think if
[39:46] you're open to it if you're honest in
[39:49] your your thinking uh it's this
[39:52] transformation it's this whole New
[39:54] Perspective and you feel like the world
[39:56] is changed and you can't go back to
[39:59] seeing things the way you did before but
[40:02] a lot of people and this is human nature
[40:04] a lot of people fight that they don't
[40:06] want to have their world view changed
[40:09] they don't want to have the framework
[40:11] they see the world with to be taken
[40:14] apart and have to build a new framework
[40:17] so they resist that a lot and I think
[40:19] that's what we experience when new
[40:21] people come into Bitcoin some of them
[40:24] have no interest in having their ideas
[40:27] challenged they don't want to know the
[40:30] truth they just want to have their bias
[40:33] uh reinforced and so that's that's the
[40:36] interesting experience there it's also
[40:39] interesting because then we come to the
[40:42] discussion about proof of work because
[40:45] you have to do actual proof of work if
[40:48] you want to understand uh Bitcoin if if
[40:53] if you come on a uh tweet and you get
[40:56] rebottled you get get uh Bush back or
[40:59] you get new
[41:01] context the human nature is like oh I
[41:04] want to win this battle but in order to
[41:07] win this battle you have to do the proof
[41:08] of work you actually have to educate
[41:10] yourself otherwise you look foolish uh
[41:12] but a lot of people choose to look
[41:14] foolish apparently but you you have to
[41:17] look you have to do the proof of work in
[41:20] order to actually engage in that uh and
[41:23] and and that's something something
[41:24] beautiful that we have this this truth
[41:27] we have this immutable Bast and then on
[41:31] top of that uh it's it's a fair monetary
[41:36] system it's in Bitcoin to show that you
[41:38] are also working it's in Bitcoin that
[41:41] you have to do something to get
[41:43] something like that's it's the most um I
[41:46] don't want to call it liberal idea
[41:48] because I don't want to put polit
[41:51] politics stuff on on top of Bitcoin but
[41:53] it's it's that proof of work mechanism
[41:55] that's truly um unique with with with
[41:59] Bitcoin and so different to this rest of
[42:02] the the fiia world yeah it's it's a
[42:06] foundational thing I think we feel that
[42:09] frustration with the politics a lot
[42:12] because people
[42:13] are not uh telling the truth and they're
[42:16] not doing the work uh you know for me my
[42:19] my my project my time chain calendar
[42:22] project was really been a great um way
[42:25] for me to actually
[42:27] put my ideas into practice and and helps
[42:33] me to you know understand it better I I
[42:37] love what you were saying about you know
[42:38] getting push back from bitcoiners and
[42:41] that's been the amazing experience when
[42:42] I share this uh this project with with
[42:46] the the the people out there who know
[42:50] Bitcoin better than me and they they
[42:52] tell me I've had many times people say
[42:55] hey this is not right or this piece here
[42:57] needs to change or you've explained this
[43:00] in the wrong way and it's it's a
[43:03] powerful next level of learning to
[43:06] actually build um I think that's one of
[43:09] the steps in the Journey of going down
[43:12] the rabbit hole is you know you first
[43:14] you you kind of like try to wrap your
[43:17] head around this and maybe you use
[43:19] Bitcoin you you you do a transaction or
[43:22] something but it's a whole next level of
[43:24] things to sort of build something
[43:27] involved with Bitcoin because it it
[43:29] actually puts all of these Concepts to
[43:32] the test so that's uh that's where my
[43:35] experience has really um taken me is to
[43:39] dive into how to you know how to
[43:42] visualize all of this information and
[43:44] how to organize it and uh that's my own
[43:47] personal kind of like
[43:51] challenge yeah I encourage everybody um
[43:54] to to to visit I wait I will I will put
[43:57] it on the screen so people can see it I
[43:59] will I quickly put it on the screen the
[44:01] time chain calendar um but while I do
[44:04] that um you chose to stay Anonymous and
[44:08] we talked about it before and that's why
[44:09] I thought about it now that is also H
[44:12] for you and uh and challenge to stay
[44:15] Anonymous uh as you go along with life
[44:17] as you try to build more stuff um we can
[44:20] talk about that but before why are you
[44:23] choosing in the first place to not
[44:25] reveal your identity
[44:27] um to to stay Anonymous and and there's
[44:30] like a lot of I think a lot of benefits
[44:33] uh to a lot of things get easier when
[44:36] you put your identity out there
[44:39] especially when it go goes to like you
[44:41] want to get attention to project or
[44:44] something like that um and I think it's
[44:46] a very Noble thing uh if someone is
[44:51] doing something and don't take their
[44:54] personal credit for that they they are
[44:57] saying I put this out and don't want any
[45:01] credit because that's basically what
[45:03] you're doing you don't tie your identity
[45:07] to the project your true identity to
[45:09] your project in that way uh nobody
[45:12] really knows who who did that so you
[45:15] you're taking this this satosi spirit I
[45:17] I also try to do it with podcast
[45:19] obviously I'm in the pictures or I take
[45:22] credit to some extent but I always say
[45:25] if you have some slip from the podcast
[45:27] or you want to take something don't ask
[45:29] me just take it like I even put on
[45:32] YouTube not the creative comments
[45:34] license I put the open license or
[45:36] whatever it's called so everyone is free
[45:39] to take whatever they want from the
[45:41] podcast of mine because I think that's
[45:43] the true Spirit of of of Satoshi that we
[45:46] are putting something out there and and
[45:49] not taking it like there's nothing wrong
[45:51] with taking credits and and if you take
[45:53] something from someone else you should
[45:55] credit them because they did it
[45:57] uh but I I like that that Spirit of
[45:59] satosi also so why did you choose uh
[46:02] being
[46:03] anonymous you know it's uh that's a
[46:06] great question I I I
[46:09] like Looking Back Now on on this project
[46:13] because this has been maybe the last
[46:15] year and a half little bit more year and
[46:18] uh seven eight months something like
[46:20] that um and looking back I'm actually
[46:23] glad that uh I've done it the way I've
[46:26] done it uh I feel like as far as the
[46:28] project
[46:29] goes I I want the project to speak for
[46:32] itself and I don't necessarily need it
[46:36] to be um viewed in the context of me as
[46:41] an individual I I really look at Bitcoin
[46:46] this way that um Bitcoin doesn't really
[46:50] need any of us but it does need but but
[46:54] we do need Bitcoin and and um that's
[46:59] kind of the spirit of which this this
[47:02] project exists is that I I
[47:05] don't uh feel like this project needs my
[47:10] you know personal identity on it um I I
[47:15] I hope that it really just speaks for
[47:17] itself and that it provides value to
[47:19] people who who use it I know that's what
[47:22] it means to me um I built it originally
[47:25] because I wanted to see
[47:28] this information in a new way and so I
[47:32] feel like um you know the greater
[47:35] question of sort of staying Anonymous in
[47:36] Bitcoin it it it touches on um this
[47:40] concept in a very interesting way it's
[47:42] the first Community I've been a part of
[47:44] even though everyone hates that word
[47:47] it's useful it's the first sort of group
[47:50] of people I've interacted with where um
[47:52] I it's not important my legal name and
[47:55] picture of my face I can choose at any
[47:57] point to start using that um but it
[48:00] doesn't it's not necessary that I'm able
[48:03] to speak with people interact with
[48:05] people exchange ideas and develop an
[48:09] identity based on that that is
[48:12] incomplete because again my ideas and
[48:16] the I and the things I share on social
[48:18] media for example they're not dependent
[48:21] on my personal identity these are ideas
[48:24] you know at the end of the day Bitcoin
[48:26] is an idea it's one of the reasons why
[48:28] it can't be killed is that it exists if
[48:32] something happened in the the network
[48:34] stopped working in some way or was shut
[48:37] down it couldn't happen but if it did um
[48:41] the idea of Bitcoin would still be there
[48:43] in people's minds and so ideas are very
[48:46] powerful ideas are very hard to kill um
[48:50] and and I feel like that's that's kind
[48:52] of um just something that's possible um
[48:56] um that that's becoming increasingly
[48:58] important to think about to think about
[49:01] because we we are living in a world that
[49:04] uh is trying to take our privacy away
[49:06] cost of this technology brings with it
[49:08] incredible connectivity but it also
[49:10] steals our privacy on so many levels and
[49:14] so using the internet and using all this
[49:17] technology um I think people have
[49:20] already kind of lost the concept of
[49:23] trying to protect their privacy and I
[49:25] feel like that's an important aspect of
[49:27] Freedom you know we want freedom go up
[49:30] um and I feel like a lot of uh places
[49:33] that people live they're using your
[49:36] identity against you I think it's just
[49:38] kind of something to keep in mind you
[49:40] know this I don't know if it can ever
[49:42] really be solved unless you run away and
[49:44] you live in the woods and you don't
[49:46] interact with anyone and don't use the
[49:48] internet but um if you are going to use
[49:51] the internet I think it's important to
[49:52] be conscious of your privacy There's
[49:55] issues of sort of safety for your family
[49:58] There's issues of you know not having
[50:00] your identity stolen because that could
[50:02] be very costly and cause a lot of
[50:05] problems and so the these these are the
[50:07] things that have just kept me attempting
[50:10] to keep things private if I can and uh
[50:14] you know again the the the project
[50:16] itself has been wonderful for me to put
[50:18] forward something share my ideas give
[50:21] people some tool to use and it doesn't
[50:24] require my name in my face in order to
[50:27] to do that and that's and that's a
[50:30] really sort of uplifting reality that
[50:33] I'm discovering and I like it and I want
[50:35] to keep it that way if I can so those
[50:37] are my
[50:39] thoughts um I just pulled it up and
[50:42] actually just when you spoke I almost
[50:44] wanted to interrupt you because there
[50:46] there was a block coming yeah I saw it
[50:48] too I've got it up I saw that the Big
[50:52] Splash when there's a when there's a
[50:54] block maybe if uh I think um because we
[50:59] in a bubble uh and and uh I I felt like
[51:02] oh probably almost everyone already saw
[51:05] the time CH calendar but probably most
[51:08] people uh in the audience uh don't know
[51:11] about it or never saw it um I I will put
[51:14] it up uh now and and maybe you can share
[51:17] some some of the most
[51:19] important um most important elements of
[51:22] it and uh what what we can see here and
[51:26] what we can take away from it thank you
[51:28] you already made it halfway through the
[51:30] video and I'm really really grateful to
[51:32] have you here two things make this
[51:34] channel possible you as a watcher and
[51:37] listener who keep supporting this
[51:39] Channel and another one is all the
[51:41] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[51:43] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[51:46] very start and where I personally buy my
[51:48] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[51:49] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[51:52] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[51:55] simplest and securest way to secure your
[51:58] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[52:00] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[52:03] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[52:06] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[52:09] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[52:12] and you know your friend does not have
[52:13] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[52:15] he needs a birthday present and a small
[52:17] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[52:19] 5% off your order plus you support my
[52:23] channel and now let's get back to the
[52:25] video
[52:27] yeah um so this is the time chain
[52:29] calendar and this is located at time
[52:32] chain calendar.com it is a web
[52:34] application so you're viewing it on a on
[52:37] a desktop screen uh it can also be
[52:39] viewed on a phone any mobile browser you
[52:43] just uh go to time chain calendar.com or
[52:45] pull it up
[52:47] um it's also functioning as a
[52:50] progressive web app so you can install
[52:52] it you can add it to home screen on our
[52:54] iOS device or select install app on
[52:56] Android and you get a little icon looks
[52:58] just like a a native app and you can
[53:00] open it um so what is this this is
[53:04] essentially a visualization of Bitcoin
[53:08] this is like the manifestation of what's
[53:11] in my head uh I uh I used a lot of
[53:16] different really great tools over the
[53:18] years with Bitcoin that helped me learn
[53:20] about Bitcoin and help me keep an eye on
[53:22] bitcoin everyone should be familiar with
[53:24] the Mol dospace
[53:27] uh there's some other really powerful
[53:28] ones out there I like bitfeed dolive
[53:31] that's one of my favorites um and there
[53:34] there's there's many more but uh I I use
[53:37] these kinds of websites in my everyday
[53:39] Bitcoin activities and because I'm a web
[53:42] developer this is you know my skill set
[53:45] I I know how to build things on the
[53:46] internet um I I got to a point where you
[53:50] know about a year and a half ago I said
[53:53] okay I'm going to make my own I kind of
[53:55] want to see bit coin in in my own way um
[53:58] I was really inspired by a block clock
[54:02] which is a piece of Hardware that's made
[54:04] by coin kite it's sort of the sort of
[54:08] thing that sits on your desk or sits on
[54:10] a shelf and it shows the block height
[54:11] and it updates with different
[54:14] information I think of this as kind of a
[54:17] next Evolution from a block clock uh
[54:20] you've got the block height the largest
[54:22] number on the screen there in the center
[54:24] of the circles that's the current block
[54:26] height and just like uh we were
[54:28] discussing before that's the moment in
[54:31] time the most recent moment in time that
[54:34] we know about from uh from the time
[54:37] chain uh and you can see uh exactly to
[54:40] the second when that block happened you
[54:43] see the little circle below the block
[54:44] height and it says last block 5 minutes
[54:47] 50 seconds ago then it's counting by the
[54:51] second and if you look closely you'll
[54:53] see that that little green circle is
[54:55] completing it's sort of like a progress
[54:58] of a 10-minute cycle and it changes
[55:02] color uh each time it Loops past 10
[55:05] minutes so if we go beyond 10 minutes
[55:07] since the last block it'll start filling
[55:09] in in a darker green and if it goes
[55:11] beyond 20 minutes it'll start filling in
[55:13] in Orange and eventually red and so
[55:16] we're visually
[55:17] displaying this idea of how long it's
[55:20] been since the last block this
[55:23] unpredictable nature of the timing of
[55:25] the blocks is being visualized in that
[55:27] little circle in the center and then um
[55:31] going around that Circle the there's a
[55:35] inner circle with all those little
[55:37] squares on it and it's labeled at the
[55:38] top the last 24 hours of blocks yeah
[55:40] you're hovering over one right now so
[55:43] that is a visualization of the last 24
[55:46] hours of blocks and it's constantly
[55:48] updated every time a new block is hit it
[55:50] gets added to the circle at the top and
[55:53] if a block falls out of the 24 hours it
[55:56] will disappear on the other side so
[55:59] essentially you can see visualized here
[56:03] the last 24 hours of blocks what's
[56:05] really interesting Robin I hope you can
[56:07] see they're not evenly spread out on
[56:09] that Circle it's very random you have
[56:12] little groupings and gaps and so this is
[56:16] actually um a really powerful
[56:18] visualization you may not have seen
[56:20] anywhere else which is what actually the
[56:22] distribution of the blocks looks like
[56:24] over 24 hours and that is constantly
[56:26] being updated and so at any time that
[56:28] you look at time chain calendar you're
[56:30] seeing that distribution of 24 hours of
[56:33] blocks and as we discussed before
[56:35] anywhere you are in the world you see
[56:37] the exact same distribution of blocks
[56:39] because this is uh not tied to a
[56:42] specific time zone this is based on
[56:45] block height and time chain and anywhere
[56:48] you are in the world you're going to see
[56:49] that same pattern of the distribution of
[56:52] blocks so that's what that circle is now
[56:55] outside of that is is the red circle
[56:57] that is tracking the blocks to the
[56:59] difficulty adjustment that is do you
[57:01] know how many blocks are in a difficulty
[57:03] adjustment sir no 2016 blocks so that is
[57:09] a important number in Bitcoin and that
[57:13] roughly takes 2 weeks if we had perfect
[57:16] 10-minute blocks 2016 blocks would be
[57:20] exactly two weeks 14 days okay so this
[57:23] is the difficulty adjustment and every
[57:26] time that indicator makes it all the way
[57:28] around to the 12:00 position we have a
[57:31] difficulty adjustment you'll see over on
[57:33] the right side in that sidebar there's a
[57:35] section labeled difficulty and you could
[57:37] see the previous adjustment about 4 days
[57:40] ago was 5% decrease in difficulty and
[57:44] you can see what that brought the
[57:45] difficulty to
[57:47] 79.5 trillion hashes per block this
[57:50] isn't basically where the difficulty is
[57:53] set for Mining and uh the difficulty
[57:57] went down because the average block time
[58:00] for that two week period was slow it was
[58:04] like 10 and a half minutes per block on
[58:06] average so the system automatically made
[58:08] it easier to find a block reducing the
[58:11] difficulty and then in that section just
[58:13] to the right of the difficulty you see
[58:15] the next adjustment estimated you could
[58:17] see the estimated date and the estimate
[58:20] amount of difficulty and what direction
[58:22] the difficulty is going to go based on
[58:23] the current pace of block which is in
[58:26] the little section right above labeled
[58:28] block production you have average block
[58:30] time there on the left uh and that says
[58:34] 9 minutes and 46 seconds and that's the
[58:38] current pace of blocks on average during
[58:42] this difficulty period during this twoe
[58:44] period which is marked by that red
[58:46] circle so if you look at time shine
[58:48] calendar every day you're going to see
[58:50] that red indicator moving its way around
[58:53] and when it gets close to the top it's
[58:55] going to start pulsing I think it's the
[58:58] last 100 blocks or so it starts kind of
[59:01] pulsating and you're going to know oh we
[59:03] get a difficulty adjustment incoming and
[59:05] it's at that point that the estimate is
[59:07] most accurate and it's at that point
[59:09] that that average block time is most
[59:11] meaningful because that's directly what
[59:14] the difficulty change points to is it
[59:16] looks at that average block time for
[59:18] that twoe period And it determines what
[59:22] direction and how much the difficulty is
[59:24] going to change so right there already
[59:26] there's some deeply
[59:28] important technical aspects of Bitcoin
[59:31] that you may not know about you may
[59:33] never have really looked at the
[59:34] difficulty adjustment or understood what
[59:36] it's about it's about this time of the
[59:40] blocks that we've talked so much about
[59:42] so that middle circle the little green
[59:45] circle on the inside you see how it's
[59:46] turning dark green now it's because it's
[59:49] been more than 10 minutes since a block
[59:51] it's almost 11 minutes right so this
[59:55] timing of the blocks is incredibly
[59:58] important to bitcoin because it it
[60:01] directly links to this mechanism that we
[60:04] call the difficulty adjustment sometimes
[60:06] it's called the difficulty retarget and
[60:08] that red circle on the interface is
[60:11] tracking how close we are to the next uh
[60:14] difficulty adjustment all right so
[60:16] that's an important point if you want to
[60:17] talk more about that we can let me just
[60:19] continue explaining the interface
[60:21] outside of the red circle we have this
[60:23] orange circle and that is tracking the
[60:26] blocks to the next having and you can
[60:29] see we have just less than 200,000
[60:30] blocks to go the having happens in
[60:33] 210,000 blocks and that's roughly four
[60:37] years if we had perfect 10-minute blocks
[60:40] 210,000 blocks would take four years and
[60:43] that is the having cycle and we just
[60:45] completed a having cycle just back in
[60:49] April and the having changes the subsidy
[60:53] which is the amount of new Bitcoin
[60:54] that's issued with each block
[60:56] by cutting it in half now I want you to
[60:58] grab that slider at the bottom you did
[61:01] this once before and just move it back
[61:03] and you can see the having going back
[61:05] and you see the big number in the middle
[61:06] rolling back that's showing you the
[61:08] block height and you can see the subsidy
[61:10] change right when you go past the top
[61:12] you see on the left corner there's the
[61:14] subsidy it goes 6.25 and then now it's
[61:17] 12 and a half so you can see the the
[61:20] amount of subsidy changing now there's
[61:22] one more Circle which is on the outside
[61:25] and that's the total Supply and so keep
[61:27] going keep moving back you see those
[61:29] little notches you just passed one those
[61:31] are the
[61:55] of Bitcoin you found an Easter egg there
[61:58] on Genesis block if you let go of the
[62:00] slider it'll Lo it'll load the block
[62:02] information if you let go so it'll it'll
[62:04] load the uh information about the block
[62:07] there um but yeah go go forward
[62:11] again and and just note the the progress
[62:14] of that dark orange circle and it hits
[62:16] that little Notch at the bottom right
[62:18] when the bright orange circle hits the
[62:20] top so keep going so the bright orange
[62:24] circle is going to reach the having a
[62:25] the top but that little dark orange
[62:27] circle hits the having at the bottom
[62:29] there that shows you visually 50% of
[62:32] bitcoin's Supply was issued in the first
[62:36] having half of the 21 million was issued
[62:39] in the first Epoch now go around again
[62:43] keep going
[62:46] forward and you see the supply Circle
[62:48] hits 75% 75% of the supply was issued by
[62:52] the time the next having happens and so
[62:54] on and so forth so we have a tool here
[62:57] you can use this to orange pill people
[62:58] you can use this to educate about
[63:00] Bitcoin that you know this is a very
[63:03] important aspect of the blocks of
[63:05] Bitcoin is they're issuing the supply
[63:07] all of the supply of Bitcoin came from
[63:10] rewards issued for new blocks getting
[63:13] hit this is the fairness of Bitcoin
[63:15] Bitcoin was not just Satoshi didn't just
[63:17] press a button and Bitcoin 21 million
[63:20] exists this isn't ethereum we have to
[63:23] actually do proof of work we have to
[63:25] actually find out and determine who
[63:27] these Bitcoins get issued to and oh by
[63:29] the way that Outer Circle that shows the
[63:32] supply can you see how far it is from
[63:34] the top it's going to take another
[63:36] hundred years for that to
[63:38] finish so this having is slowing down
[63:42] the issuance of the Bitcoin and you can
[63:44] visually see that because each of those
[63:46] notches is half as close to the previous
[63:49] one and you're basically going to we
[63:52] won't be alive to see the final issuance
[63:55] of Bitcoin so this is really one of the
[63:57] beautiful things about Bitcoin is it's
[63:59] not just that we don't know who it's
[64:01] going to be issued to it's not just that
[64:04] the supply gets slowed down over time
[64:08] but it's also that it happens over
[64:10] multiple generations and I think that
[64:12] was a very
[64:13] important uh design Choice by Satoshi he
[64:17] didn't want Bitcoin to be issued in just
[64:20] a year or two or 10 years even you know
[64:23] the difficulty adjustment is actually
[64:25] what makes makes that happen right
[64:27] because if the blocks come in too fast
[64:29] the difficulty gets increased which
[64:31] slows down the pace of blocks I'm going
[64:34] to point you to the bottom right corner
[64:36] of the whole site and there's that box
[64:38] that's labeled time chain and it says
[64:41] since Genesis move your mouse to the
[64:43] right right there 9 minutes and 34
[64:47] seconds that's the average block time
[64:48] for the entire chain if you take
[64:52] 85128 blocks and divide by the amount of
[64:56] time since January 3rd 2009 it's 9
[64:59] minutes and 34 seconds so that's
[65:02] constantly updated every time we have
[65:04] another block it checks that math and it
[65:06] makes sure that that's showing the
[65:07] correct average block time for the whole
[65:09] chain so you know just in these circles
[65:12] in the main interface here there's a lot
[65:14] of aspects of bitcoin's design its
[65:18] technical functioning learning the
[65:20] significance of the having relative to
[65:23] the supply learning the significance of
[65:25] the difficulty adjustment relative to
[65:27] the pace of the blocks happening and
[65:30] being able to visualize the blocks in
[65:32] this way this is what I'm trying to do
[65:35] I'm trying to actually find a way to
[65:38] visualize these things so you could just
[65:40] glance at it at any time and you see
[65:43] where we are it's a calendar it's a
[65:45] calendar of this new time system that
[65:47] started 15 and a half years ago and
[65:50] continues every 10 minutes going into
[65:52] the future this is the time Chan
[65:54] calendar
[65:56] it's beautiful uh it's uh it's really
[66:00] cool to have it all in one one place um
[66:03] one random question I'm not as
[66:06] technically savy it's it's shorted here
[66:09] it's um under 10 minutes and here it's
[66:12] under 10 minutes to average block time
[66:14] is that because the network is growing
[66:18] uh because the the difficulty adjustment
[66:21] is usually going up and it has to keep
[66:24] up I mean here it's uh it adjusted down
[66:27] but uh if if the network is growing uh
[66:30] at a at a good Pace then it usually has
[66:33] to
[66:34] um adjust the difficulty up so then the
[66:40] average block time
[66:42] is is usually
[66:45] probably under 10 minutes is that is
[66:48] that why it did so great question first
[66:50] I just want to
[66:51] clarify um the bottom where it says time
[66:54] chain that is a measurement of the
[66:56] average block time for the entire
[66:58] lifetime of Bitcoin the one that's
[67:01] underneath block production that's
[67:02] further up there that shows 9 Minutes 47
[67:05] seconds that's measuring the average
[67:07] block time just for this uh difficulty
[67:10] period so in the difficulty section
[67:13] below it says four days ago that average
[67:15] block time right there is just in those
[67:18] four days right we had a 5% decrease in
[67:22] difficulty because the blocks were above
[67:24] 10 minutes on average during that
[67:27] previous difficulty cycle so it's just a
[67:30] it's a little bit um unintuitive at
[67:32] first but hopefully people can just
[67:34] start thinking in terms of the the cycle
[67:36] of that red circle that that's basically
[67:38] the difficulty adjustment cycle and we
[67:41] measure the block time uh in each of
[67:43] those Cycles to determine where the
[67:45] difficulty goes now when we talk about
[67:49] the average block time on the whole
[67:51] timeline um yeah it's faster than 10
[67:54] minutes and in enal thinking forward I
[67:58] think what you want to think about is is
[68:01] the Bitcoin Network growing is there
[68:04] more people adopting Bitcoin more
[68:07] importantly are there more people
[68:09] choosing to compete to win blocks are
[68:12] there more people mining are there more
[68:14] people trying to to win that issuance
[68:17] and if you're optimistic about that if
[68:19] you if you believe that Bitcoin is going
[68:21] to continue growing I think you would
[68:23] assume that we would on a a over a long
[68:26] period of time have faster than 10minute
[68:29] blocks because you're going to have more
[68:32] people competing to find blocks and the
[68:34] more hash rate on the network the faster
[68:37] the blocks will come in the the
[68:39] difficulty adjustment is backward
[68:40] looking it comes in and says wow those
[68:43] were fast blocks that you found in the
[68:45] last two weeks let's increase the
[68:47] difficulty and for periods of time it
[68:49] will slow it down you know right now
[68:52] we're we're after a having and we expect
[68:55] after a having some miners to give up
[68:59] because maybe they were barely
[69:01] profitable before the having and after
[69:04] the having when the block reward is cut
[69:06] in half they are not profitable at all
[69:09] and they're losing money mining and at
[69:11] some point they may have to decide I've
[69:14] got to give up I have to unplug and stop
[69:16] mining because I'm losing money doing
[69:18] this um so we do expect these things to
[69:21] kind of you know EB and flow a little
[69:25] bit especially in relation to the having
[69:27] and how profitable miners are but over a
[69:30] long period of time certainly over years
[69:32] and multiple Cycles if you believe
[69:35] bitcoin's growing if you believe that
[69:37] there's more people competing to try to
[69:39] win those blocks you would imagine that
[69:42] the blocks would come in faster than 10
[69:44] minutes on average over a long period of
[69:45] time and sure enough look at that 9
[69:47] Minutes 34 seconds for 15 and a half
[69:50] years shows us that this thing has been
[69:53] growing the whole time we've had more
[69:56] people trying to compete uh there were
[69:58] times when on average the blocks were 15
[70:01] minutes in the past there were other
[70:03] times when the blocks came in at seven
[70:04] minute average over a long period of
[70:07] time this the system encourages close to
[70:11] 10 minutes that's all it's trying to do
[70:13] with the difficulty adjustment is try to
[70:16] kind of compensate for was it too fast
[70:19] was it too slow and overtime I honestly
[70:22] I think it's amazing that we are so
[70:24] close to 10 minutes after average
[70:26] because of how random the blocks are
[70:28] coming in they come in sometimes 1 2
[70:31] three right in a row boom boom boom just
[70:33] a few seconds and it's incredible that
[70:36] this system is slowing it down enough
[70:41] despite all of the people that have come
[70:43] on to to mine and at and joined this
[70:46] competition uh parabolic growth of the
[70:49] hash rate despite that we're still very
[70:52] close to 10 minutes it's showing you
[70:54] that this system is working and that
[70:56] this difficulty adjustment is doing its
[70:58] thing and it shows you that Bitcoin will
[71:00] indeed be issued over many generations
[71:04] into the future instead of just in a
[71:06] short period of time you know without
[71:08] this difficulty adjustment with this
[71:09] increase in competition all the Bitcoin
[71:12] would have been mined already 21 million
[71:14] would be gone already if we did not have
[71:16] the difficulty adjustment to kind of
[71:18] slow it
[71:21] down it's it's amazing and we also see
[71:24] right now uh in real time the block can
[71:27] take longer than 10 minutes because the
[71:30] right now is like 22 minutes already and
[71:33] we also see the nice orange line that
[71:35] you teased before that comes after the
[71:38] the dark green one really cool yeah it's
[71:40] going to turn red and dark red
[71:41] eventually if the block takes too long
[71:43] at some point I'm going to add some
[71:45] animation to it if it goes over an hour
[71:47] it should start shaking it should
[71:49] instill a little anxiety in you you know
[71:52] um this is the power of these sort of
[71:54] visualization I'm trying to actually
[71:57] help people just be aware and notice
[72:00] that you know it's going to be in about
[72:02] uh you know 10 days or so we're going to
[72:05] have the next difficulty adjustment if
[72:06] you remember look at your time chain
[72:08] calendar every day if you look at it 10
[72:11] days from now you're going to notice
[72:12] that red circle start to pulsate to let
[72:15] you know the the the change the
[72:18] adjustment is about to happen and it's
[72:20] going to sort of pulsate deeper and
[72:23] faster as it gets closer you know when
[72:24] you get to about uh you know 10 blocks
[72:27] away that things kind of you know really
[72:29] alerting you that something's
[72:31] happening which is also cool uh people
[72:34] can actually now go to time calendar.com
[72:37] and look what the current block height
[72:40] is and then compare it to this block he
[72:43] so they know kind of like when we
[72:45] actually made this episode uh and when
[72:49] it aired and everything like it's it's
[72:51] really cool uh I mean you can also see
[72:54] um I don't know if it's in this in the
[72:57] in the Stream also but uh can you also
[73:00] see my my time there probably it's not
[73:03] on the screen right yeah yeah it says
[73:05] 7:49 p.m. there so that's the thing
[73:07] about the web is that if you pull up
[73:10] this website wherever you are in the
[73:11] world it's going to be showing your date
[73:14] and time at the bottom so I see a very
[73:17] different time uh over here in
[73:19] California on my time chain calendar at
[73:21] the same time uh it's going to show you
[73:23] your local time and whatever block you
[73:26] go to in the past that's going to be
[73:28] relative to your uh time zone the time
[73:32] when you see it so go just go to a
[73:33] random Block in the past just let go see
[73:37] it loads and it's showing you that was
[73:38] 3:40 a.m. your time and you can see a
[73:41] center that's roughly six months ago you
[73:43] see the details about the block you see
[73:45] who lined it look at the Block Roar up
[73:48] up above see says subsidy 625 6.25 and
[73:52] then the fees and then the block reward
[73:54] was over set
[73:56] over seven Bitcoin in that block went to
[73:58] antpool so you know now click the double
[74:00] arrows to go back to live and you can
[74:03] see the block reward now just this last
[74:05] block was 3.2 this big difference
[74:07] because the subsidy went down and also
[74:09] the fees are quite low right now let me
[74:11] draw your attention to that up top of
[74:13] the sidebar there's that section that
[74:16] box that you see fee rates and menol uh
[74:19] green and red over on the right in the
[74:21] sidebar yeah so um what we have here is
[74:24] we have a very simple view of the
[74:27] current fees so you see priority rate
[74:30] and anytime rate this is just really
[74:32] simple guidance if you are interested in
[74:34] doing a transaction pay attention to
[74:37] that priority rate that's the estimate
[74:39] of what it's going to take to get into
[74:41] the last block you can also see
[74:43] underneath the block height uh so back
[74:47] in the main interface um 851 281 just
[74:50] below that you see on that little
[74:52] details line 4,000 transactions
[74:55] and then just to the right of that it
[74:56] shows uh eight SATs per VTE was the uh
[75:00] average fee in the last block and then
[75:03] it shows you the range 6 to 289 and now
[75:06] you look at the current uh fees up at
[75:09] the upper right which is shows you 11 so
[75:12] you can see just since the last block
[75:14] because it's been almost a half hour
[75:16] since the last block the priority rate
[75:19] to get into a block has gone up and so
[75:21] using this information you can get a
[75:23] very good sense about
[75:25] maybe what kind of fee you need to put
[75:27] on your transaction if you really care
[75:30] about when it's going to get into the
[75:32] time chain so if you had to transact
[75:34] right now and you need it to happen as
[75:36] soon as possible you probably want to
[75:38] pay a fee of 11 or higher if the block
[75:42] takes more time to get confirmed that
[75:45] fee rate will go up so depending how
[75:49] absolutely urgent you are you might want
[75:50] to bid a much higher fee right if you
[75:53] put 20 SATs per V B you're probably
[75:56] going to get into the next block for
[75:57] sure if you don't really care about how
[76:00] fast your transaction's going to get in
[76:03] use that anytime rate you know you pay
[76:05] four or five sets per Vite maybe the
[76:07] transaction goes in sometime in the next
[76:09] hour or maybe later today um and then
[76:13] that Purge level in the fee rates that's
[76:16] giving you an indication of if you pay a
[76:19] fee that's that low or
[76:21] lower you're not even being held on to
[76:25] by most nodes most nodes are not even
[76:27] storing your transaction in memory so
[76:29] this is very simple guidelines to give
[76:32] you a sense of what kind of fee you
[76:34] should pay if you're very urgent
[76:36] priority what kind of fee you should pay
[76:38] if you're not in a rush anytime and be
[76:41] aware don't put your fee at or below the
[76:44] purge level because that's going to
[76:45] really slow your transaction down um so
[76:48] that's uh useful information if you're
[76:50] transacting just below that there's
[76:52] mempool information that shows you the
[76:54] quantity of transactions in the men pool
[76:57] um how many blocks that is and that
[77:00] inflow amount is the currently how many
[77:04] uh how much new
[77:05] transactions uh data is coming into the
[77:08] men pool at the moment you'll see that
[77:10] number Spike sometimes when there's a
[77:12] huge influx of new transactions coming
[77:14] in but just you know that that box is uh
[77:19] contained and displayed in that way just
[77:21] to show you this is the information
[77:23] about getting into a block this is sort
[77:26] of like block space demand information
[77:31] fees and the and the data about what's
[77:34] there that you're competing with to try
[77:35] to get into a
[77:37] block that's is that is really cool I
[77:40] love it a lot um it's also like well the
[77:44] the fees are a low now so it's a good
[77:47] time to to consolidate your U or
[77:49] something like that you want to do it
[77:51] doing yeah you notice the fee section is
[77:53] green
[77:54] that that's not always the case color
[77:56] changes yeah the color changes it
[77:58] changes to not green if if it goes
[78:01] higher than 20 and if they go above a
[78:04] certain threshold it'll turn red uh I I
[78:06] really try to use color to help
[78:09] communicate things um and again this is
[78:12] sort of the nature of this project is
[78:14] it's meant to be a very functional
[78:17] dashboard that you just glance at and
[78:19] you get a good sense um what's going on
[78:23] so you might not even see the number of
[78:25] what the fee is but from across the room
[78:27] you could see oh the fees turned red
[78:29] it's not a good time to transact right
[78:31] now it's very expensive um you know and
[78:34] that's the kind of thing that uh I I
[78:37] like to to focus on on this
[78:39] project it's also a cool idea like
[78:42] before you make a transaction just like
[78:44] quickly look at a time CH calendar and
[78:47] uh then you see the see oh it's green or
[78:49] it's uh yellow whatever and then you're
[78:52] like oh if it's green I can do it now is
[78:55] red I will wait a little
[78:57] bit yep exactly so now look we just
[79:00] finished another loop we're more than 30
[79:02] minutes since the last block and now
[79:04] that circle is starting to get filled in
[79:06] with the dark orange and it gets serious
[79:09] after that if we do another 10 minutes
[79:10] comes red and you know so like this this
[79:13] thing is just trying to communicate with
[79:15] you it's just trying to tell you where
[79:17] we are right now and you know it's funny
[79:19] because we had this conversation about
[79:21] you know the timing of the blocks and
[79:22] the time chain and this randomness it's
[79:25] not necessarily wrong it's not
[79:27] necessarily bad but you know this is
[79:30] kind of the more nuanced way to think
[79:34] about Bitcoin we say oh blocks or every
[79:37] 10 minutes Bitcoin verifies or every 10
[79:40] minutes this happens well it's not every
[79:43] 10 minutes look at that 24 hours of
[79:44] blocks you can see how uneven it is and
[79:47] right now we're experiencing more than
[79:49] 30 minutes since the last block so it's
[79:51] it's just one of these things where use
[79:53] this
[79:55] uh use this app and start developing a
[79:58] better sense and there it is we hit a
[80:00] block look at that so um you know it all
[80:03] starts over again now now we're we're
[80:06] starting the the timer over and and look
[80:08] at the fees all of a sudden okay up in
[80:11] the upper right hand corner it's eight
[80:13] sets per V per Vite to get into the next
[80:16] block priority but look at the fees that
[80:18] were paid in that last block you can see
[80:21] right under the big block height it says
[80:23] 16 SATs per V bite was the average fee
[80:27] in the last block right oh another block
[80:33] do you see that that was like one minute
[80:36] since the previous block we hit another
[80:38] one so this is a great example you can
[80:42] start to get a sense what's actually
[80:45] happening here now look at the last
[80:46] block was average seven SATs per Vite to
[80:49] get in so the one before that was 16 and
[80:52] that was because it took so long to the
[80:54] previous block so timing sometimes makes
[80:57] the difference if you're really urgent
[81:00] you're going to have to pay higher to be
[81:02] sure you get in the next block whereas
[81:04] look if you just waited you can get into
[81:07] that previous block for for much less so
[81:11] this is a this is all just an effort to
[81:14] try to wrap your head around how Bitcoin
[81:17] works and this can be very relevant to
[81:20] you as an individual if you want to
[81:22] transact on chain you should be aware of
[81:25] these things you should have this stuff
[81:26] in front of you it's kind of like you're
[81:28] going to go out into the world you're
[81:29] going to walk out of your house or your
[81:31] apartment you're going to go out in the
[81:33] world maybe should you look out the
[81:35] window and see if it's raining or not
[81:37] maybe should you check the temperature
[81:38] and see if you should wear a sweater or
[81:40] if you should be in a t-shirt like it's
[81:42] the same kind of thing check it out see
[81:45] what's going on in the men pool see what
[81:47] the fees are
[81:48] like uh and and get a better sense
[81:51] before you broadcast your transaction so
[81:54] that you can be efficient and transact
[81:57] uh
[81:58] efficiently now priority even is down to
[82:01] six
[82:04] yep I think it's uh um we we're all
[82:08] almost going over time right now but I
[82:12] it's it's a really cool topic and I feel
[82:14] like um a lot of people learned uh in
[82:18] the last like 30 40 minutes a lot about
[82:21] uh the blockchain about the time chain
[82:23] sorry
[82:25] uh and it's it's it's great it was also
[82:28] a really cool example with the 30
[82:29] minutes then we hit one and then right
[82:32] after was I don't know if it even was a
[82:34] minute I think it was like around a
[82:35] minute or maybe even less than that we
[82:37] hit a new one now we're waiting two
[82:39] minutes for that we saw the transaction
[82:41] fees for that um it it's been really
[82:44] educational um thank you already for
[82:46] that uh and uh it's it's it's been
[82:50] already really cool yeah hey I want to I
[82:53] want to point out one more thing which
[82:55] is that um the app is in 14 different
[82:59] languages including German oh and I
[83:02] don't know if you've ever had a look in
[83:04] German I do have to apologize I did a
[83:07] big update just a week or so ago and so
[83:10] there's a few English strings in there
[83:12] I'm waiting for my translator to uh make
[83:16] another set of updates on the labels so
[83:19] we have some uh a few English strings
[83:22] that still need to be translated to
[83:24] German and that should be updated in the
[83:25] next week or so um but if you go to time
[83:29] chain calendar.com
[83:31] de it's in German so you can share it
[83:34] with your German speaking friends and
[83:36] you can do all of this stuff in German
[83:38] language as far as learning about
[83:41] Bitcoin and um understanding these
[83:44] technical aspects that we've been
[83:45] talking about so uh yeah actually you
[83:49] can you can uh you can see most
[83:51] everything is in German uh at this point
[83:54] there's a couple things you'll see in uh
[83:57] in English that have snuck through um
[83:59] those are the labels that need to be
[84:00] updated still but it it should be very
[84:03] um should be very understandable
[84:06] hopefully um for someone who is German
[84:09] speaking maybe not as comfortable with
[84:11] English uh and you know really that
[84:14] that's the beauty here is I I I'm I'm
[84:17] trying to get this in as many languages
[84:19] as possible I have it translated into
[84:21] Chinese I have it translated into uh
[84:25] French and German and Italian Spanish
[84:28] Portuguese um and
[84:32] uh yeah there we
[84:35] go so really Arabic is another big Greek
[84:41] yeah so it's it's really a um it's a
[84:44] it's a challenge I've had actual um
[84:47] plebs help me with every translation
[84:50] I've not automated anything it's all um
[84:53] very carefully crafted
[84:55] uh
[84:55] translations um and the the reason is
[84:58] because this educational potential this
[85:01] is really a a powerful tool for someone
[85:05] to learn more about Bitcoin themselves
[85:07] or to help teach others about Bitcoin if
[85:09] you go to the info section at the very
[85:11] top there's a little info link um
[85:13] there's a terminology list in there that
[85:16] has a lot of these terms kind of
[85:18] explained uh to try to you know give
[85:20] better context around what's being
[85:23] displayed here
[85:24] um and so you know that's just kind of
[85:27] part of my hope with this project is
[85:28] that this is going to be um really
[85:33] a a useful thing for people that they're
[85:35] going to hopefully learn something about
[85:38] Bitcoin you know just looking at it
[85:39] every day uh it can function like a
[85:42] calendar can really help you uh see
[85:45] where we are in the journey and help
[85:47] build your
[85:48] conviction I also L those Resources with
[85:50] m. space with like uh uh what the
[85:55] happened in 971 with the Bitcoin white
[85:57] paper cool cool resources yeah yeah I'm
[86:02] I'm trying that that list is going to
[86:03] keep growing you know that list uh right
[86:05] there that shows that the inspiration
[86:07] for time chain calendar that's like
[86:09] really um an important thing you know
[86:12] all of those projects in there the block
[86:14] clock Clark Moody's dashboard they
[86:16] they've all really inspired me and so I
[86:18] wanted to make sure people could get to
[86:20] all of those things um there's also you
[86:23] know I mentioned in there mental space
[86:25] is important because I'm actually using
[86:26] their uh API uh to provide the the data
[86:31] so if you actually pulled up time chain
[86:33] calendar and mental space side by side
[86:35] you would see uh the same numbers for a
[86:38] lot of the data points I'm getting that
[86:40] data from their API it's one of the
[86:43] things on my road map at some point I am
[86:45] going to build out my own API to back
[86:47] this but this project is really a uh
[86:50] client side app that's you know my
[86:52] specialty is frontend web so uh I built
[86:56] this as basically it's it's kind of like
[86:58] a a new skin on top of meal space data
[87:02] so that's that's one way to kind of
[87:04] understand exactly what I what I've
[87:06] built
[87:08] here that that's really cool and I mean
[87:11] it's it's it's great that you uh you
[87:13] work together with mol really cool I I
[87:16] met the guys from from there on on
[87:18] bitcoin Prague I think last year the
[87:21] first time all the really cool cool
[87:23] people there
[87:25] yeah absolutely
[87:28] Legends perfect then uh let's wow I did
[87:33] not expect that that that section takes
[87:36] so long but I loved it a lot like uh it
[87:39] was um some there were new things in
[87:43] there for me uh and definitely a lot of
[87:46] new things probably for for my audience
[87:49] and I think it's important to to put
[87:51] this Edie Tak knows and and even almost
[87:56] cheing
[87:57] stuff also in the all the libraries like
[88:02] I know that a video where there's like
[88:06] oh Bitcoin 100x oh Bitcoin to 10 million
[88:08] probably gets more
[88:10] clicks um but it's so important to to to
[88:14] get the the fundamentals out and I feel
[88:17] like the the time CH calendar and m.
[88:20] space and all those those websites are
[88:22] kind of an represented of those
[88:25] fundamentals and it's like an an UI for
[88:30] for Bitcoin for for everyone to access
[88:34] at any time and they really like it's
[88:36] easily understandable and it's as you
[88:39] said it could be even a potential um
[88:42] orange peeling Tool uh and and people
[88:45] see it it's like there's something
[88:47] happening with a new block and you can
[88:48] explain how the new blocks added and
[88:50] stuff like that it's it's really cool uh
[88:53] thank you just for for uh thank you for
[88:55] building that it's it's it's really nice
[88:57] yeah I I mean I I find it's important to
[89:01] say um in talking with people it's like
[89:05] so many people just staring at a price
[89:07] chart that's all they look at and they
[89:09] think that's Bitcoin but that's actually
[89:12] outside of Bitcoin Bitcoin has no price
[89:15] you notice on the time chain calendar I
[89:17] don't call it price I say it's exchange
[89:19] it's it's exchange between Fiat and
[89:21] Bitcoin but that's that's the only place
[89:24] that you see that um information the the
[89:28] whole rest of the interface it's all
[89:29] about the actual thing that's what
[89:32] people are buying and selling is Bitcoin
[89:33] and it is actually a real uh technology
[89:37] it's an actual protocol and and there's
[89:40] some things to learn in order to be able
[89:42] to even think about it properly and we
[89:45] all know that you go down that rabbit
[89:46] hole and that's where the real
[89:48] conviction comes from find out there is
[89:51] freedom go up and there is these other
[89:53] as aspects that actually are so
[89:57] important without those things nobody
[89:59] would care and so I I think it's so
[90:02] important to help um see that and and
[90:06] and that's that's hopefully what time
[90:08] chain calendar is doing I I really
[90:10] appreciate you having me on I I I'm so
[90:13] grateful for um being able to share this
[90:16] and I know that uh there's so many uh
[90:19] bitcoiners in Germany and in German
[90:22] language and I'm I'm very stoked to uh
[90:26] to have people using this I know that
[90:28] that um there was a a lady in the German
[90:32] bundist do who had the time Chine
[90:34] calendar up on her her wall everybody
[90:36] tagged me when she did some video and it
[90:39] was up there and it's you know to me
[90:41] that's just so exciting it lifts my
[90:43] spirits to know that um this is being
[90:46] actually viewed um by people all over
[90:49] the
[90:50] world it's exciting yeah see she's a a
[90:54] member of the German
[90:58] Parliament Joanna kot I think it's her
[91:01] name and had the picture you sended me
[91:04] to to me right before we started the
[91:06] podcast it it is really cool that uh she
[91:09] actually did go down the rabbit hole uh
[91:13] and I had the honor to be with her in a
[91:16] space or two already and interview her a
[91:19] little bit and yeah it's it's it's been
[91:21] great uh talking with her and and and
[91:24] and seeing where where she says like
[91:26] it's it's in it's cool to to see also
[91:29] the the politics a little bit coming now
[91:31] into Bitcoin and and uh people in
[91:34] politics noticing they they kind of have
[91:37] to adopt it because the voters adopted
[91:39] it and now they're kind of forced to it
[91:42] like that's the whole thing with Trump
[91:44] Trump trump doesn't talk about Bitcoin
[91:47] right now because he think it's cool at
[91:49] least I think so he talks about it
[91:51] because uh he thinks it brings him him
[91:54] votes if he's an actual Bitcoin or not
[91:56] like I have no clue I'm also not in
[91:58] America I have no clue about American
[92:00] politics I also don't care um but uh
[92:04] interesting is that he talks about it
[92:06] and that he um has the need to talk
[92:09] about it right now because Bitcoin is so
[92:10] powerful and also with TR Kota from the
[92:13] German Parliament it's it's great and uh
[92:17] it's it's even better if if uh she's
[92:20] posting a picture where it's on the wall
[92:22] imagine what what
[92:24] uh What wave it would get if if Donald
[92:28] Trump did the same thing as TR kot and
[92:30] putting a picture TV and there's the
[92:33] time J CA yeah no I mean I I just I just
[92:36] hope that um she's like learning about
[92:40] Bitcoin on a deeper level and that's the
[92:43] potential um I hope for time chain
[92:45] calendar is it's like you can keep an
[92:47] eye on bitcoin itself and you can
[92:50] actually understand it deeper than just
[92:52] what's the price today you
[92:54] know um before we come to our Andro I
[92:57] have one uh last question for you um and
[93:03] I'm asking specifically not for for the
[93:06] priz what are your wildest future
[93:09] prediction for
[93:12] Bitcoin well I got to say um I I know
[93:17] there's going to be a lot of challenges
[93:19] and I don't think it's a straight line I
[93:21] think it's a roller coaster ride but I
[93:24] do believe that there is the potential
[93:27] for change
[93:28] in how Society
[93:31] functions in regards to money that if
[93:35] this monetary system in Bitcoin can be
[93:38] adopted um and infiltrate all these
[93:41] different layers of society because I
[93:44] that's what we see we see it going from
[93:47] individuals to businesses and
[93:51] corporations now Nations States um at
[93:55] some point uh the incentives that
[94:00] Bitcoin encourages can actually lead us
[94:04] to new ways of structuring society and
[94:09] new ways of interacting that maybe if we
[94:12] don't have the same um ability to
[94:15] corrupt that the Fiat money system
[94:18] provides maybe it provides an anchor
[94:21] that allows um Society to build in a in
[94:25] a much more uh strong and um
[94:30] uncorruptible way I think it's a it's a
[94:33] bit optimistic it's a bit hopeful I hope
[94:36] it's not naive but I do believe there's
[94:38] some potential for that I think if you
[94:40] asked me that question a few years ago I
[94:42] said it's for sure it's going to totally
[94:44] change everything now I have a little
[94:46] bit more of a kind of nuanced view that
[94:50] it's maybe just the first step and many
[94:53] more steps are required but I think it
[94:56] really does have that potential to to
[94:58] help change the way people uh organize
[95:02] and and interact with one in a in a
[95:05] positive I think that's uh I see it more
[95:09] and more that uh bitcoiners
[95:12] are um seeing Bitcoin in a realistic con
[95:17] context more and more I I I see what you
[95:20] described like a year ago like it's it's
[95:23] it likes Bitcoin is kind of growing up
[95:27] and Bitcoin airs also growing up with
[95:30] with Bitcoin and I think that's that's
[95:32] that's something good and and beautiful
[95:34] actually um perfect and uh our Andro
[95:37] team consist us uh uh from two questions
[95:40] the first question is always the same
[95:41] one even though I changed it a little
[95:43] bit uh a few episodes back um and the
[95:47] last question is then uh from the
[95:49] previous guest so the the question is
[95:52] always the same is for you what can we
[95:54] learn from you besides Bitcoin and
[95:59] money wow
[96:01] uh
[96:04] I I just hope that
[96:07] um people take a look at time chain
[96:10] calendar that's really that's really it
[96:12] I I I I view this project as my way of
[96:18] sharing All of My
[96:20] Views um about about Bitcoin um outside
[96:26] of Bitcoin um I
[96:31] think I I'm I'm personally just on
[96:34] a sort of self-improvement phase of My
[96:37] Life um if you talk to
[96:40] me like on on Twitter uh you're likely
[96:44] to hear me talking about carnivore diet
[96:47] and fitness and health and family I mean
[96:52] these are these are things that I have
[96:55] really um started to focus on in my
[96:58] personal life and so I don't know if
[97:02] that rubs off on anyone I think it's
[97:05] really kind of the amazing thing about
[97:07] Bitcoin is that it serves as a catalyst
[97:10] to form this perspective where you're
[97:13] seeking truth and you're seeking the
[97:16] better ways of doing everything and
[97:18] you're you're paying attention to proof
[97:19] of work and so those Concepts apply to
[97:23] everything outside of Bitcoin as well
[97:26] and so maybe that's all I I I hope that
[97:30] people do the best thing to become the
[97:33] best version of themselves be healthier
[97:37] pay attention take just as much interest
[97:39] in your food as what you're taking in
[97:42] your money and take just as much
[97:44] interest in building a family and uh you
[97:49] know that's the best thing you can do
[97:50] for your future have kids and raise them
[97:53] well and build a family I mean this is
[97:56] the the that's the basic building blocks
[97:59] of humanity so you know I I guess I
[98:02] would
[98:03] say uh you know take those take that
[98:07] truth seeking mentality from Bitcoin and
[98:10] apply it to everything else meaningful
[98:12] in your
[98:13] life that's beautiful and by the way we
[98:16] are already there the second longest
[98:18] episode yeah I love
[98:21] it um but we will not beat the the the
[98:24] longest episode it was over two hours
[98:26] unfortunately oh wow well this has been
[98:29] an absolute pleasure thank you for
[98:31] having me um before we come uh we I have
[98:33] the last question the the the question
[98:36] from the previous guest so we have this
[98:38] Ender team where the previous guest is
[98:39] asking a question for the next guest
[98:40] without knowing who the next guest
[98:42] actually is um and your question is what
[98:45] would you do if we did not have
[98:49] Bitcoin oh boy um
[98:54] I mean I think my my world view would
[98:57] still be very clouded um I probably
[99:01] would
[99:02] be trying to stack gold and silver maybe
[99:08] I I might be
[99:11] um I might be you know looking at some
[99:13] of this self-improvement stuff and you
[99:16] know trying to find sovereignty but I I
[99:19] have a hard time imagining I would see
[99:21] it the same way without Bitcoin because
[99:24] Bitcoin has really given me my
[99:26] perspective on sovereignty that's in a
[99:29] in a whole new way you know before I
[99:31] found Bitcoin I I was interested in sort
[99:34] of prepping and kind of thinking about
[99:38] you know what happens if Society goes
[99:41] the wrong way how do I survive so I I
[99:44] guess that that's where my head would be
[99:46] as kind of still um trying to figure out
[99:50] uh how
[99:51] to how to Pro
[99:53] some certainty in an uncertain World um
[99:57] that's that's I think what happens in
[100:01] adulthood anyways I think as we all grow
[100:03] older that's what you focus on how do I
[100:06] provide some certainty for myself for my
[100:10] family um so maybe that's where my focus
[100:13] would be but a whole another level of
[100:16] clarity comes from Bitcoin it really
[100:18] does help you kind of weed through the
[100:21] fog and the noise and B the signal and
[100:25] focus
[100:27] there I love it a lot perfect then
[100:30] before that you go um where can people
[100:34] find you outside of time Ching calendar
[100:36] is there some way to to contact you yeah
[100:39] so timeing calendar.com is is a project
