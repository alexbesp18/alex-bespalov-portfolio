[00:00] But imagine you being a politician in
[00:02] the US Senate or Congress and you need
[00:05] to convince the US that we should print
[00:08] money to buy Bitcoin. You think if you
[00:10] do think that I want to know what you've
[00:12] been smoking because I want some. Well,
[00:14] there seem to be more and more pension
[00:16] funds that are starting to get into
[00:18] Bitcoin. I would have if you open your
[00:20] browser and you type in pension fund
[00:22] Bitcoin, I'm sure you'll get the
[00:24] article. I don't think Black Rockck is
[00:26] actively manipulating the price. I don't
[00:27] think so. I have been looking at ETFs
[00:30] and their performance for the better
[00:31] part of the last 5 years and this
[00:33] Bitcoin ETF was unreal. There's a large
[00:36] enough portion of people who have some
[00:39] Bitcoin and they want to get rid of it
[00:41] because they don't know what they're
[00:42] doing. So much for Plan B. It's just
[00:45] offsetting risk, exercising the footnote
[00:47] and the footnote has always put the
[00:49] screws on governments. That is why
[00:51] governments absolutely hate it.
[00:55] [Music]
[00:57] Hi Mike. How are you doing? Fine. It's
[01:01] good to see you again man. Really really
[01:04] nice. Um since the last time we recorded
[01:06] a lot has happened but probably the
[01:09] biggest news is the strategic Bitcoin
[01:11] reserve. Do do you other things or is
[01:13] there something even bigger than that
[01:14] that you would would like to add it? It
[01:17] was the biggest thing that happened
[01:19] again this is all just my opinion. It
[01:22] was the biggest thing that happened in
[01:23] terms of of attention within the Bitcoin
[01:26] community. Now, I I don't want to be the
[01:29] Danny Downer here, but I I think it's a
[01:31] little bit
[01:33] overhyped. Um I'm not saying it's it's
[01:36] not a great thing, but um I've been
[01:39] asking around um with people who are in
[01:44] the Bitcoin space. And when you ask them
[01:47] like, "So, this Bitcoin reserve that
[01:49] President Trump is pedalling, what do
[01:52] you think that is?"
[01:54] and they think a little bit and they
[01:56] say, "Well, he's he's going to buy
[01:57] Bitcoin with US dollars." No, no, he's
[02:01] not. He's
[02:02] not. What is it then? Well, so far, and
[02:06] I'm not saying he couldn't change his
[02:07] mind on this, and there are ways to do
[02:09] it. What the US strategic Bitcoin
[02:12] reserve is, and let's be honest, it's
[02:14] the only one that matters as of now, is
[02:17] they have a bunch of Bitcoin that they
[02:19] confiscated and they're just not going
[02:21] to sell it.
[02:23] I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's
[02:24] better than what the Germans did. That
[02:26] was that was hard to watch, man. That
[02:29] was hard to watch. But it's not like
[02:31] Trump has said like we're going to buy
[02:33] more Bitcoin. He's just going to keep
[02:35] the ones he already
[02:36] has. Like I said, good thing. I I don't
[02:39] mind. That's good. But it's it's not as
[02:41] big of a deal as you may think. So he
[02:45] he's not if it stays as it is, there is
[02:48] not going to be any price action from
[02:50] this because it's already priced in. How
[02:52] big how important is that? Because as
[02:56] you said, right, fully so uh they
[02:58] already had the bitcoin before they
[03:01] didn't buy bitcoin. They didn't do
[03:02] anything with that. But how important
[03:04] Yeah. How important is that the USA is
[03:08] now wording them differently and saying
[03:11] we are strategically holding them uh and
[03:14] we might buy more in like how how how
[03:17] important is that narrative shift of
[03:19] like oh like we have conversated piton
[03:21] to like we hold it strategically
[03:24] okay in in terms of narrative it's it's
[03:26] it's very important because people are
[03:29] easy to manipulate I mean I if if I come
[03:33] out and say what you just said is
[03:35] [ __ ] then that's an insult. But if
[03:38] I say what you just said is bovine
[03:40] excrement, then it sounds a lot better.
[03:42] It's still the same thing, though. So,
[03:45] from a narrative point of view, it it
[03:47] can surely have an impact. When when the
[03:50] United States has a strategic Bitcoin
[03:52] reserve and people are listening to
[03:55] this, they might be incentivized to act
[03:57] upon it and that's a good thing. But
[04:00] that is way outside of my area of
[04:03] expertise. I mean, you you need to have
[04:04] a marketing specialist there. From that
[04:06] point of view, it's great. From an
[04:08] effective point of view of what is being
[04:10] done, nothing's being done. Still better
[04:11] than what the Germans did.
[04:14] Way better. They had 50,000 bitcoins and
[04:16] now they have like zero. Yeah. And how
[04:19] much did they effectively lose? How much
[04:21] would they have gained if they had just
[04:22] kept it? Like how many millions?
[04:25] I I think if you look at the um it was
[04:29] uh especially the news when Bitcoin hit
[04:32] like 100k 105k and at that point it was
[04:36] uh I think even in the the 1 billion
[04:38] mark. I I could be wrong here but it was
[04:40] a really high amount in euros that they
[04:44] uh lost uh by basically selling them six
[04:49] months too early. Look, at least paper
[04:52] hands get shaken out. Whatever. Do you
[04:54] think overall it's a good thing that
[04:57] governments buy Bitcoin? Some people say
[05:00] like we want the grassroots movement. We
[05:01] don't even want the governments to to
[05:03] have that power. Yeah, that's that's a
[05:05] tough one because if you I am I am on I
[05:08] am on X. I am X is the only place where
[05:12] I actually have an account. I use it
[05:14] sparingly mainly to look and then I get
[05:18] the rest from um from other services
[05:21] that like scan Facebook. But you don't
[05:23] need to have an account. There seems to
[05:25] be two sides here. One side is saying
[05:28] we're the original cipher punks and um
[05:31] we need to be against government and
[05:33] this is very bad. Why are you all sing
[05:35] for the
[05:37] government? There is nothing wrong with
[05:39] idealism. I'm not I'm not um saying it's
[05:43] a bad thing. The other view is that this
[05:45] was bound to happen and this is actually
[05:47] a good thing because the more people buy
[05:50] it, the scarcer it gets. the more the
[05:52] price moves up and let's be honest here
[05:54] whatever whatever it is you want to do
[05:56] with Bitcoin it is meaningless if price
[05:58] doesn't go up number go
[06:01] up I
[06:02] personally I like to be a pragmatist
[06:06] sure it would be great if the government
[06:08] was completely sidelined by this and it
[06:11] was all in the hands of private
[06:12] individuals but that's a little bit
[06:15] blue-eyed so I'm not saying it's a good
[06:17] thing I'm not saying it's a bad thing I
[06:19] am saying that it's going to impact the
[06:22] price positively, it will lead to more
[06:24] mass adoption. And that I do regard to
[06:26] be a good thing. But I'm not going to
[06:28] chastise anyone who says that this is
[06:31] from an ideological point of view not
[06:34] the most favorable outcome. It's
[06:36] interesting. It's also interesting how
[06:38] quick that that move and if there's like
[06:40] an effect where more and more states uh
[06:44] they are definitely looking into it but
[06:46] if they're also acting acting on it and
[06:49] there's um this Lumis bill from and and
[06:52] I have I'm walking on a fine line here
[06:55] because I really have no clue of of what
[06:58] America is doing with politics and what
[06:59] it takes to introduce a bill and and
[07:01] what it what it means. But I have talked
[07:04] with some people and there's websites
[07:05] where you can actually track those
[07:07] things. The Lumis bills is now a second
[07:09] time there. Uh and there are many states
[07:11] like taxes seems to be a good one that
[07:14] that they are also doing those things
[07:16] and there are if I'm not mistaken 35 of
[07:20] those bills currently in discussion
[07:22] somewhere in America. Um so it feels
[07:25] like down the line there could be a lot
[07:28] of Bitcoin buying if those all things
[07:31] pass. From what I understand, nothing
[07:33] has passed yet. It's all in the in the
[07:36] process. I'll believe it when I see it.
[07:39] I'll believe it when I see it. Um I it
[07:42] the the question is was what happened
[07:45] with this strategic Bitcoin reserve
[07:47] enough to start this domino effect
[07:50] because we have already been burned. I
[07:52] mean the the Korean central bank I think
[07:55] they wanted to buy Bitcoin. It was shot
[07:57] down in their version of parliament. As
[08:01] for the states, let me put it this way.
[08:02] On a pure numbers game, we should be
[08:05] glad because if we have one jurisdiction
[08:10] that tries to get this Bitcoin bill
[08:11] passed, there's a certain chance of it
[08:14] passing. But if we have 39 or
[08:16] so is a higher chance that at least some
[08:19] will pass. So the the start has been
[08:22] made.
[08:23] I am much more interested to see what
[08:27] will happen now that Black Rockck is
[08:29] starting to shill that stuff and they
[08:32] are shilling that stuff. Um I don't know
[08:35] which one this article I read it like um
[08:38] weeks ago but there seem to be more and
[08:41] more pension funds that are starting to
[08:43] get into Bitcoin. I would have if you
[08:45] open your browser and you type in
[08:47] pension fund Bitcoin I'm sure you'll get
[08:49] the article. I think that's going to be
[08:52] a lot better because there's a higher
[08:53] chance that they'll do it because
[08:54] they're not beholden to to political
[08:57] bias. They just have Black Rockck who's
[09:00] coming around and says, and I think
[09:03] somebody's going to correct me on this,
[09:04] the target of Black Rockck is you should
[09:06] have at least 2% in Bitcoin and they're
[09:10] across the line for private individuals,
[09:13] um, high netw worth individuals. There
[09:15] you go. This is this is much more
[09:18] exciting to me than what the politicians
[09:19] are doing. because there is a lot more
[09:22] of them. There are a lot more pension
[09:23] funds around than there are politicians
[09:25] around who want to want to do this.
[09:28] Interesting. Yeah. And I heard different
[09:31] um I heard different targets from Black
[09:33] Rockck. I think they also changed the
[09:35] target uh in in their journey of of
[09:39] getting orange builds somehow. Uh but
[09:41] yeah, that's super interesting. It's
[09:43] also Yeah. like you you you you think
[09:45] nation states is the big story but then
[09:48] you see one company Micro Strategy
[09:51] having already bought 500,000 Bitcoin or
[09:54] more uh then uh GameStop is now coming
[09:57] out and those institutions and pension
[09:59] funds uh and BlackRock that is uh
[10:02] selling basically Bitcoin selling
[10:05] shilling Bitcoin and and trying to
[10:07] onboard Bitcoin to their services
[10:09] onboard uh funds to their I think this
[10:11] is a really big story these private it
[10:14] little guys because compared to
[10:15] governments they are little. They are
[10:18] much quicker to react. They're under a
[10:20] lot more pressure and they work together
[10:23] with Black Rockck many of them and a
[10:27] thousand of those will make a higher
[10:29] impact than three or five US states or
[10:32] even the US government because like I
[10:33] said they're not buying anything and
[10:36] quite frankly I don't think they will. I
[10:38] don't think they will. They're going to
[10:39] buy gold. They understand how gold
[10:41] works. they're not gonna buy Bitcoin.
[10:43] Um, just, you know, you and me, we are
[10:47] in this bubble. We're hyped up and
[10:49] everything and that's a good thing. I
[10:50] like the enthusiasm, but imagine you
[10:53] being a politician in the US Senate or
[10:56] Congress and you need to convince the US
[10:59] that we should print money to buy
[11:01] Bitcoin. You think? You think? If you do
[11:05] think that, I want to know what you've
[11:07] been smoking because I want some. Um,
[11:09] like I said, and as for Black Rockck,
[11:11] the the main
[11:14] target, sure, it has an impact, but I
[11:17] don't care that much about it. What I
[11:19] care about is that Black Rockck is now
[11:21] in on it. And people people completely
[11:24] underestimate this. Black Rockck is not
[11:27] your college buddy who has an investment
[11:29] fund in his free time, which he tracks
[11:31] on Excel. We are talking about one of
[11:34] the largest, most evil, most nefarious,
[11:39] self-centered, profit-driven companies
[11:41] on the face of this
[11:43] earth. I mean, I I'm pretty sure that if
[11:46] there's an opening to hell, it's
[11:47] somewhere in Black Rockck headquarters
[11:50] or the DMV depending on it's the DMV.
[11:53] It's likely the DMV, but I could think
[11:55] that Black Rockck is an outskirt of
[11:57] them. And these guys are in on it. Now,
[12:00] the main fact that they're in on it
[12:01] means that they've already made the
[12:03] decision. They've already made the
[12:05] decision. They they already said we're
[12:07] going to do it. The question is how fast
[12:09] and how thoroughly. Of course, um this
[12:13] also gives rise to speculations about
[12:15] price manipulation as they have been
[12:17] circling around the internet. Those are
[12:19] some interesting conspiracy theories.
[12:21] But I mean the difference between the
[12:22] conspiracy theory and the truth is about
[12:24] 6 months now. I presume it's it's it's
[12:27] it's I love how you describe Black
[12:30] Rockck. Uh but it is true like we have a
[12:34] huge powerful
[12:36] um company institution what this this
[12:39] thing is uh on on our side that that's
[12:42] just do do you think this second year of
[12:46] the ETFs is the bigger story that is
[12:50] currently going on? bigger than what I
[12:52] mean economist here. Compared to what?
[12:55] Compared to a strategic Bitcoin reserve
[12:57] to basically everything from a narrative
[12:59] point of view. No. From a price action
[13:01] point of move. Yes, absolutely. Because
[13:05] first itself and now this Bitcoin
[13:09] ETF has reached a size in a time that I
[13:12] have never seen before. Ever. I mean I
[13:17] have been looking at ETFs and their
[13:19] performance for the better part of the
[13:21] last five years and this Bitcoin ETF was
[13:25] unreal and now the inflows are picking
[13:27] up again. So the only question remaining
[13:29] now is like I said the conspiracy theory
[13:32] on whether the price is being
[13:33] artificially held down by Black Rockck
[13:36] through on the hand on OTC sales in
[13:38] order to shake out the paper hands.
[13:41] depends on how cynical you
[13:42] are. But the inflows have I mean there's
[13:45] there are websites where you can track
[13:47] how many how much
[13:49] inflow goes into this ETF and it's
[13:51] massively picking up. It's massively
[13:53] picking up. How how big of a Sorry, go
[13:55] on. Mhm. No, no, I was done. Um how big
[13:59] of an a risk is that for for you uh that
[14:04] they they manipulate the price and how
[14:06] long do you think they can even do it?
[14:08] Because with I mean we've seen it with
[14:10] with FDX they basically have done it.
[14:12] They they held only a few bitcoin for uh
[14:16] many many bitcoins they should have hold
[14:19] u but eventually it blew up. Black or is
[14:22] a different beast than fdx definitely.
[14:26] First of all um this is nothing out of
[14:29] the ordinary. Price manipulation has
[14:31] been going on for as long as these
[14:33] companies have existed. I mean, we all
[14:35] fondly remember how JP Morgan tried to
[14:38] manipulate the silver
[14:40] price. Uh, the gold price has been
[14:42] manipulated by the LBMA themselves by
[14:45] misrepresenting how much gold they had
[14:47] on hand. And last but not least, um, you
[14:50] do realize that the gold price of the of
[14:54] the United States is still valued at
[14:57] around $30 to $40 an ounce, I think.
[15:02] Yeah, it's one of the ways how they
[15:04] might make some money by re reevaluating
[15:06] it to market prices. So is bit is black
[15:10] rockck manipulating the price? I don't
[15:12] know. Depends on how cynical you are. Um
[15:14] if you go max cynical maximum
[15:17] cynicism then bit then black rockck is
[15:20] selling bitcoin in order to keep the
[15:23] price low to shake out the paper hands
[15:25] and then buying their bitcoin and their
[15:27] own bitcoin back again. If they're if
[15:29] they're if if if Black was absolutely
[15:31] sure that they wouldn't get caught,
[15:34] they'll do it. I'd do it. I'm a piece of
[15:36] [ __ ] I I'm not going to lie about that.
[15:38] But if but depending on what the risk to
[15:41] their reputation is, I think it's a
[15:43] little bit up there. I I think that the
[15:46] the current price which is you know a
[15:49] little bit low a little bit low in my
[15:51] opinion is still being kept down by just
[15:55] regular paper hand selling especially in
[15:57] the United States because it's April and
[16:00] I know this might be a fringe a fringe
[16:02] issue but you do realize what happens on
[16:04] the 15th of April
[16:08] uh tax season in in America tax day and
[16:12] what do people do before tax stay.
[16:15] Oh, they have to sell something to to
[16:17] get to have money. If there's a large
[16:20] enough portion of people who have some
[16:22] Bitcoin and they want to get rid of it
[16:24] because they don't know what they're
[16:26] doing, this might be it. This is really
[16:28] fringe, but there are many different
[16:30] factors that come in. I don't think
[16:32] Black Rock is actively manipulating the
[16:33] price. I don't think so. But then I am
[16:36] such a goodie two shoes. I I trust them
[16:38] because I have their ETFs as well. Yeah.
[16:40] I I I mean it's super interesting how
[16:44] when America and Black Rockck moved into
[16:46] the ETF game, there's a lot of movements
[16:48] coming coming in because we had an
[16:50] European one. We had what was it in the
[16:53] Canadian one? I think before we had Hong
[16:54] Kong, I think they won one too. Yeah,
[16:57] like Hong Kong also. Yeah. And there are
[16:59] now some news coming in that again this
[17:02] is um I don't trust half the stuff I
[17:04] read online and that's still too much.
[17:07] Um but that China might be actually
[17:10] making Bitcoin legal again. It's
[17:12] interesting. How how much are you paying
[17:14] to attention to to the price and where
[17:17] it should be? You said like the the
[17:18] price seems a little bit low. Are you
[17:20] paying attention like price models?
[17:22] Seems low. No.
[17:24] Um there are there in my opinion and
[17:27] this is I am I'm not that sophisticated.
[17:29] I'll I'll be honest about that. There
[17:32] are only two ways how you could um there
[17:36] are spreadsheets for that. I'm not going
[17:37] to go into detail. I'll keep it really
[17:39] really simple. There were only two ways
[17:41] how you could look at how the price of
[17:43] Bitcoin
[17:45] moves. As long as the retail era was
[17:47] going on, it was the four-year cycle.
[17:50] That's it. As soon as the having comes
[17:52] in, it goes up. Now we are in a
[17:55] transition phase between retail to
[17:57] institutional. I'm not going to say
[17:59] governmental because I don't care about
[18:01] them that much yet. And now the one
[18:05] thing that the two things that are going
[18:07] to drive the price now in my opinion
[18:09] again my opinion is supply and demand
[18:13] which means the fouryear cycle will
[18:14] still have some impact but
[18:17] liquidity how much fiat money is being
[18:20] pumped into the system because we
[18:22] measure it in fiat money so far. So the
[18:25] price will be strongly influenced by
[18:29] four major players. The Federal Reserve,
[18:32] the European Central Bank, the Japanese
[18:35] central bank and the Jungor and Minion
[18:37] Han, the the Chinese central bank. These
[18:40] four are going to determine the price
[18:43] fluctuation depending on how much fiat
[18:46] money they are going to inject into the
[18:49] system. Which means the question is how
[18:53] much [ __ ] are they going to be? And
[18:56] we've seen from history that they will
[18:59] in the end eventually they'll all go
[19:01] full [ __ ] I mean um Japan has already
[19:04] done it. Japan has gone full
[19:08] [ __ ]
[19:09] Um the only thing that's saving their
[19:12] ass now is that the the bulk of Japanese
[19:15] debt is in the country and not outside
[19:17] of the country. and they have large
[19:18] dollar reserves which they can
[19:20] just fork out if they want to. As for
[19:23] the Chinese, um they're just they're
[19:25] currently trying to save save their
[19:27] housing market which is not going to
[19:30] work. And after that they will have to
[19:33] see how they react to the tariffs that
[19:35] Trump is trying to impose. As for the
[19:38] EDB, the European Central Bank, they're
[19:40] like the special kid within the special
[19:42] class because they'll they'll just print
[19:45] money on every issue that you want.
[19:47] Right now, we need to send garbage bags
[19:50] to Ukraine, print 460 million. Is the
[19:54] money still there? We don't know. Um,
[19:56] just print some more. The only ones who
[20:00] are a bit of a conundrum, and they're
[20:01] also the biggest is the Federal Reserve.
[20:04] And with the Federal Reserve, I have to
[20:06] say, um, I don't know what to make of
[20:08] these guys because Powell, we know
[20:11] Powell is is a spineless prick. He's no
[20:14] he's no vulker. So the question is, how
[20:18] is he going to react? Because his
[20:20] different mandates are currently a
[20:22] little bit intermingled. On one hand,
[20:24] their inflation target is still at
[20:26] 3%. It's high. Um, however, the stock
[20:30] market is at an all-time high. Having
[20:32] said that, the employment market is
[20:35] starting to catch up again and the
[20:37] tariffs are still an
[20:39] unknown.
[20:40] So Powell has made extremely
[20:44] contradictory remarks on how he wants to
[20:46] proceed with quantitative easing,
[20:48] quantitative tightening. We all know
[20:50] that whatever he says cannot be trusted
[20:52] because he can redefine what he actually
[20:54] meant, you know. Yeah, that's what I
[20:57] said. But what I meant was, which is
[20:59] basically, yes, I was lying, but now I'm
[21:02] lying in a different
[21:04] way. And uh it all comes down to
[21:07] feeling. I can give you what my feeling
[21:09] is. I think Powell is going to cave. I
[21:13] think in within the next year, he's
[21:16] going to start printing money again. He
[21:18] can't help himself. He has to. Maybe
[21:21] because he actually has a reason for it
[21:23] or maybe just because he wants to get
[21:24] one over Trump. Because let's be honest
[21:26] here, Powell hates Trump. He hates him.
[21:29] He hates him so much. And fair enough,
[21:31] you can hate people for whatever reason
[21:32] you want. And once the Fed starts
[21:35] printing again, that will drive the
[21:37] price of Bitcoin up again. But that's
[21:39] just my personal uninformed opinion
[21:42] based on eight factors. You can find
[21:45] people with spreadsheets with 3,000
[21:47] factors on it. And this is the the thing
[21:50] that always comes with fiat money.
[21:54] Eventually there comes an issue.
[21:55] Eventually there comes a reason to print
[21:57] money and then they will print money and
[21:58] the more they print the more money they
[22:01] have to print the next time to keep the
[22:03] whole system running. Well um people in
[22:06] the Austrian school have always compared
[22:08] it to basically being drunk. I don't
[22:12] know if you're familiar with this
[22:13] concept and I have spent some time in
[22:16] festivals when I was young. Are you
[22:18] familiar with the concept of a
[22:21] cont? Yes. your you hang over and get
[22:24] another beer to to get another beer and
[22:26] get better. Now, we both know that
[22:29] that's a very very bad idea, but when it
[22:32] comes to fiat money printing, that's
[22:34] what they're doing. We got slightly
[22:36] drunk now. We about to sober up, but the
[22:38] headache is really bad. Let's get some
[22:40] more alcohol in and more and more and
[22:42] more and more until you finally just
[22:44] shut down. The question is, how long can
[22:46] they afford to kick the can down the
[22:48] road? Do you think that there's a point
[22:49] where the can just explodes and and the
[22:53] fear system is over
[22:55] in a specific nation state? Absolutely.
[22:58] Um we've already seen that several times
[23:00] over this history of mankind. Can happen
[23:03] any time. I I mean uh globally like
[23:06] there there's literally no fiat money
[23:08] left.
[23:10] No, because the government can mandate
[23:13] you to pay their taxes in fiat money.
[23:15] They can mandate you to pay fines in
[23:17] fiat money and as long as they exist and
[23:20] do that there was always going to be a
[23:21] case for fiat. The question is how
[23:23] prevalent will it be? I mean we could we
[23:26] could theoretically speaking arrive at a
[23:28] point where everything is done in
[23:30] Bitcoin in maybe gold maybe other stuff
[23:33] and every time you need to pay your tax
[23:35] as a fine I'll buy some
[23:38] fiat. There you
[23:40] go.
[23:41] Bye. could be, but I don't think it will
[23:44] globally. And there is still competition
[23:47] going on. I mean, we've seen what
[23:49] happened in El
[23:50] Salvador. Um, El Salvador is a really
[23:53] nice case example of what happens when
[23:55] you try get push back and then you
[23:58] basically tell the IMF to bend over and
[24:00] relax because people have been
[24:02] misinterpreting that for the longest
[24:04] time. El Salvador made fiat made their
[24:06] Bitcoin legal tender. That's great. They
[24:10] never said it's the only legal tender
[24:12] ever. And then the IMF came in and they
[24:16] have now basically El Salvador had some
[24:19] sort of mandate on Bitcoin as well. And
[24:22] the IMF said, "We're going to give you
[24:24] more money, but you need to remove the
[24:26] mandate." And then Na Boukle basically
[24:29] said, "Okay, mandate's gone, but fiat is
[24:31] but Bitcoin is still legal
[24:33] tender. Now the people can choose what
[24:35] they want to choose." So basically he he
[24:38] screwed over the IMF. They just don't
[24:40] want to admit it. Fair enough.
[24:43] That that was uh that is that is so
[24:45] funny because I was in November in El
[24:47] Salvador. Is it nice? And uh it it's it
[24:50] was nice and uh and the thing is
[24:54] officially there was a mandate
[24:57] uh to accept Bitcoin payments.
[25:00] I was in multiple shops and stores and
[25:04] on vacation spots where you can see and
[25:06] touristy things like whatever you can
[25:08] imagine. Every time I was outside of the
[25:11] Bitcoin conference tour, every time I
[25:13] was just a normal guy there, nobody
[25:17] accept the Bitcoin. Uh maybe I was just
[25:19] in in bad luck, but I can personally say
[25:23] it was not a mandate. It was definitely
[25:25] not a mandate. They were not afraid to
[25:27] not accept Bitcoin. Then then the impact
[25:30] is even smaller. The IMF basically got
[25:32] something that they already had. Naib
[25:35] Bukella didn't care. Maybe it was even a
[25:37] trap, but I am not going to to to claim
[25:40] that he's playing 4D chess. That always
[25:43] turns out
[25:44] bad. Now the mandate is gone. Nothing
[25:47] has changed in El Salvador. I mean,
[25:48] after the mandate was dissolved, nothing
[25:51] changed. And these still they're still
[25:53] buying one Bitcoin a day. Good for them.
[25:56] I even heard I even saw this chart.
[25:58] Sometimes they even buy more than one
[26:00] Bitcoin like the when when it goes up
[26:02] because it's public thing. But I think
[26:04] the especially when the news came out
[26:06] with the IMF, he posted that chart more
[26:09] often and I think he bought in a day a
[26:10] little bit more than one bitcoin. If you
[26:12] can stick the middle finger in their
[26:13] face, then you should absolutely do it.
[26:15] These people deserve it. They deserve
[26:17] everything. I mean, the I I would have
[26:19] done the same thing. And the best thing
[26:21] would be if it turns out that he used
[26:23] the money from the IMF to buy
[26:25] Bitcoin. That that would be that would
[26:27] be the absolute like cherry on top.
[26:30] about not only it was a lot of money
[26:32] like it was 3.5 uh billion if I'm if I'm
[26:36] not correct something around I mean
[26:39] billion next time it will be a gorillion
[26:41] you just need to print enough of it yeah
[26:44] we need uh new words for for for the
[26:47] amount of money that we will have like
[26:50] 16 fantastilians
[26:52] um one thing that uh I'm fascinated the
[26:56] the aspect of uh game theory is super
[26:59] interesting
[26:59] We have now a very small county, Budan,
[27:03] which is extremely small. Uh I think
[27:05] it's like half of Vienna or something
[27:07] like that. Using energy to mine Bitcoin
[27:09] and stuff. Yeah. And and they have uh
[27:13] around the amount of Bitcoin as El
[27:14] Salvador or maybe a little bit more.
[27:17] They are they extremely really having a
[27:19] lot of Bitcoin for the amount of people
[27:21] that they are. Then El Salvador
[27:23] obviously is stacking Bitcoin. Now
[27:25] America is we already discussed not not
[27:28] selling the they're naming it strategic
[27:30] Bitcoin reserve. How do you think the
[27:32] the game theory of of Bitcoin and the
[27:35] states that are earlier in there
[27:37] especially with Europe being like more
[27:39] in the CBDC direction um will play play
[27:43] out. My personal opinion more and more
[27:45] countries will have to jump on if for no
[27:48] other reason than not to be left behind
[27:50] and whoever is last will get the least
[27:52] amount. I mean, I'm pretty sure that
[27:56] let's assume that China really is
[27:58] thinking about liberating the law,
[28:00] allowing for Bitcoin, having their own
[28:02] Bitcoin. The only reason why they would
[28:04] do that is in order to get one over on
[28:06] the Americans. Question is, who's going
[28:08] to come first? And the Americans, they
[28:10] are not first yet because they're not
[28:12] buying. El Salvador is
[28:14] first. El Salvador is first. The others,
[28:17] America is not first. So, there's still
[28:18] time for other countries to jump in. Of
[28:21] course, if you reverse this whole thing
[28:24] like Germany and just sell what you
[28:25] have, then I don't know what to tell
[28:26] you. I don't know what to tell you. In
[28:28] Switzerland, we're we're now um having a
[28:32] petition in order for the Swiss National
[28:34] Bank to buy Bitcoin. Switzerland is an
[28:36] extremely conservative country. Frankly,
[28:38] I think they'll get enough signatures in
[28:41] order to force the vote. I think it'll
[28:43] be voted no. And just recently, I've
[28:46] seen an interview on Business Insider
[28:48] with the head of the SNB, and he made it
[28:51] damn clear that he doesn't want to buy
[28:53] Bitcoin. His reasoning being that it's
[28:55] too volatile, which tells me everything
[28:58] I need to know about the guy. It it it's
[29:00] so interesting uh what people bring up
[29:03] as negative points around Bitcoin
[29:05] because you can actually tell a lot
[29:07] about a person that does not have
[29:09] Bitcoin and asking like why not Bitcoin?
[29:11] You you can actually read a lot into
[29:14] that. Yeah, you can. But um it it has
[29:17] gotten kind of boring recently. I mean,
[29:20] I've I've seen some threats again on X
[29:23] and the arguments are just absolutely
[29:26] outlandish. Like, so what what would you
[29:29] do if there is a there's a say a
[29:33] blackout? What would you do if there's a
[29:35] blackout? And then look, there's not
[29:38] going to be a blackout globally. Well,
[29:40] if there is a blackout globally, what
[29:42] happens to your precious? Okay. Okay,
[29:44] what would you do if the sun explodes
[29:46] and our whole solar system is swallowed
[29:48] up by a black hole and reality
[29:51] disintegrates? I mean, I I can do this.
[29:53] How likely is that? How likely is that?
[29:57] It is is they're running out of
[29:59] arguments and they're need they need to
[30:01] come up with more and more outlandish
[30:03] stuff, which is good for us because if
[30:05] that if that's how far they need to go,
[30:07] we're safe. We're we're bloody safe. And
[30:09] it's also interesting how a new thing
[30:12] always has to prove itself in every
[30:14] small detail. The quantum computing
[30:16] thing and stuff like that. A current
[30:19] system never has to like we don't ask
[30:22] the digital euro how quantum resistant
[30:24] it is. We ask Bitcoin which is way
[30:27] better against those things. Uh which is
[30:30] really interesting. What what is maybe
[30:33] an interesting question uh for for
[30:35] Bitcoin like us? What is the best
[30:37] argument you heard against Bitcoin so
[30:39] far? I've heard many good arguments
[30:41] against Bitcoin. The question is always
[30:43] how likely are they? I mean, if the if
[30:47] the if um
[30:48] [Applause]
[30:49] the how's it called, what if the Shaw
[30:52] 256 algorithm is breached, which could
[30:56] be cryptography is making leaps and
[30:59] bounds every year. What if it's
[31:01] breached? Yes, that would be a problem.
[31:03] Now you ask some cryptographers and they
[31:06] say we just roll back the network to the
[31:09] point where it was and then we use a new
[31:11] kind of hash. What if the government
[31:14] says you can't use it anymore? Well,
[31:17] again, unless the whole world is saying
[31:19] that it's not going to do much. The
[31:21] Chinese tried it and yes, in China you
[31:25] can no longer have or mine Bitcoin, but
[31:27] the rest of the world didn't care.
[31:28] Bitcoin didn't care. There's even this
[31:30] one guy who didn't care if you know who
[31:33] I'm talking
[31:34] about. You know that one guy.
[31:37] Um, which are you talking about? Okay.
[31:40] Like they forbid Bitcoin and everything
[31:43] in China, Bitcoin went off the mining,
[31:47] the holding, whatever. But then there
[31:50] was this this company that was tracking
[31:52] where the nodes are, where the Bitcoin
[31:53] nodes are. And they figured out, you can
[31:56] find this online. I don't know where it
[31:58] was. There was one Bitcoin node, one
[32:00] that was still active in China, operated
[32:03] by someone over the door network.
[32:05] Whoever that guy or girl is, that that's
[32:07] just you. You got some balls. I mean, so
[32:10] one guy just said, "Nah, I'm going to
[32:12] keep operating my Bitcoin node." So that
[32:15] didn't
[32:16] work then. Um, sure, if people say if
[32:20] there is something better than Bitcoin
[32:22] coming up, if there is something even
[32:24] better than Bitcoin, so far I haven't
[32:26] seen anything. And based on the
[32:29] occurrence of such mediums of
[32:31] transaction, I don't think there will be
[32:33] anything in the near future. I mean, it
[32:35] took us quite a while to get to gold and
[32:39] then it took us again quite a while to
[32:41] get to Bitcoin. If that's the time
[32:43] frame, still, we're safe. So, these are
[32:45] all good arguments against Bitcoin. No
[32:47] questions asked. They're just very
[32:48] unlikely. Let's take a break for a
[32:50] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[32:53] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[32:56] watches. Those watches are the most
[32:59] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[33:02] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[33:05] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[33:08] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[33:11] watch collections. You have the date of
[33:13] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[33:17] there and of course also the block
[33:19] height and which epoch we are currently
[33:22] in. I love the level of detail they put
[33:25] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[33:28] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:30] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[33:33] love those watches so so much. And now
[33:36] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[33:38] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[33:41] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[33:42] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[33:45] first way is you put it on a hardware
[33:47] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[33:50] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[33:53] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[33:56] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[33:59] if you check out the link in the
[34:00] description, you even get 5% off if you
[34:03] use the code Robin. And the second way
[34:06] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[34:09] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[34:12] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[34:15] They will personalize for you a
[34:18] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[34:20] your individual situation. They will
[34:23] show you how you can secure your own
[34:25] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[34:28] enough. You also have to keep all your
[34:30] devices secure. One topic that is
[34:32] overlooked often is the inheritance
[34:35] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[34:38] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[34:40] a plan for that in place already? And
[34:43] last but not least, if you're in a
[34:44] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[34:47] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[34:49] that, head over to the
[34:53] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[34:56] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[34:59] be for the first time ever speaking at
[35:01] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[35:04] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:07] really looking forward to seeing all of
[35:09] you there. You can get your ticket in
[35:11] the link down in the description of
[35:14] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[35:16] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[35:20] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[35:21] there. The the thing is also Bitcoin is
[35:23] a social revolution uh and not just a
[35:26] technical one. So you not
[35:28] only if it would be so easy to just copy
[35:31] the code because Bitcoin is open source
[35:33] then you can improve on one thing and
[35:35] then you have your own fork and you have
[35:36] your own coin and everyone is jumping on
[35:39] there because it's a social revolution
[35:40] that that does not work entirely. I mean
[35:43] that's already happening ever since the
[35:45] network went online. There have been
[35:47] many improvements to the protocol which
[35:49] just had to be accepted by everyone. I
[35:51] mean the BIP 39 with the word that's was
[35:54] an improvement. um segwit was an imp
[35:57] everything is an improvement that
[35:59] doesn't mean it needs to change it's
[36:00] still the same thing and I mean the the
[36:02] block size wars have shown us that it's
[36:05] quite resilient even if you have a good
[36:08] argument because the argument in the
[36:09] block size wars wasn't that bad it
[36:12] wasn't that bad they said we need
[36:16] um more transfers you there not enough
[36:19] transfers possible the downside is that
[36:22] if the block size becomes bigger
[36:25] people won't be able to operate their
[36:26] own node anymore. This was basically put
[36:29] up to a
[36:30] vote and the majority decided, no, we're
[36:33] going to keep the block size as it is.
[36:35] We will have a lower transaction volume.
[36:38] This was then saved through the
[36:40] lightning network. And the people who
[36:42] went with the larger block size, which
[36:44] is I think Bitcoin
[36:46] Cash, they're still here. They're just
[36:48] irrelevant. But you do you. I love that
[36:50] they're still here, but irrelevant.
[36:52] Yeah, they went down. Uh I mean that
[36:55] were you around at that time because I
[36:58] unfortunately not it was the first time
[36:59] I heard about Bitcoin. I heard so many
[37:02] stories already around that time um
[37:05] where people said it was actually
[37:07] looking like Bitcoin Cash is winning and
[37:09] also the charts when you look at the
[37:11] beginning times between where Bitcoin
[37:14] Cash uh came out uh it it actually
[37:17] looked like oh like maybe actually
[37:18] people are funing in. Compare that price
[37:20] action to the price action of any other
[37:23] shitcoin and tell me what you see. Yeah,
[37:26] it's the same thing. I am not
[37:28] impressed. This was to be expected. Like
[37:31] every single every single shitcoin,
[37:34] memecoin, whatever coin, Dracula coin,
[37:38] your mama coin in the
[37:40] beginning and um the same thing happened
[37:43] with Bitcoin Cash. Yeah, it it
[37:45] definitely it I can I can uh just for
[37:48] the people that uh are not aware of that
[37:51] part of the history, it it looks uh
[37:54] exactly like that. You you start here uh
[37:57] and then it shot up actually and it had
[38:00] some volatility like up down up down but
[38:03] at some point it was just very clear
[38:05] that any other shitcoin. Pick your
[38:08] favorite shitcoin that went down to
[38:10] nothing and then compare it. You'll see
[38:11] the exact same thing. I mean, I am not a
[38:14] big fan of those um technical analysis
[38:16] stuff, which I think is just voodoo for
[38:19] for finance people. It's just voodoo for
[38:21] finance people, just like astrology is
[38:24] racism for women. But
[38:28] um it's the same thing up going down.
[38:32] Where's the difference? Where?
[38:34] Absolutely. It's it's it's just
[38:37] shortterm like oh hype and then like oh
[38:40] it actually has no value. It goes down.
[38:42] Okay. I have some some friends who work
[38:44] in one of the biggest banks in
[38:46] Switzerland. I'm not going to name
[38:48] it. And they are quants in case you know
[38:52] what a quant is, right? I no it's
[38:56] basically a mathematician who decided to
[38:58] go into
[38:59] finance. It's that's a quant. Um, and
[39:04] they have programming experience and
[39:05] they all told me they can make a
[39:07] shitcoin tomorrow and this is exactly
[39:09] how the price action will move will will
[39:11] look like nothing new under the sun.
[39:14] Yeah, there's even a side pump fund
[39:17] where you can actually make it yourself
[39:19] and this completely disrupted shitcoin
[39:21] because now there's no technical
[39:23] expertise needed whatsoever. Like you
[39:26] can literally everyone can do it. I mean
[39:29] even the Ethereum network is not
[39:30] protected. You can just piggyback on it.
[39:34] You can literally piggyback any kind of
[39:36] shitcoin on the Ethereum network. You
[39:38] just have to buy the Ethereum and you
[39:39] buy the shitcoin with it. Fair enough.
[39:41] But I mean, Ethereum itself is a is a
[39:44] weird type of shitcoin because it's the
[39:46] most obvious example of centralization.
[39:49] Are we ever going to completely get rid
[39:52] or mostly get rid of those [ __ ] coins?
[39:55] No. It's too much fun. No. Why? Why
[39:57] would you say that? This is the funniest
[40:00] [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life. That's
[40:02] like think, are we going to get rid of
[40:04] of of
[40:06] pinks? Like those those those micro
[40:08] stocks in the US which you can buy for
[40:11] like two cents. Like why would you buy
[40:15] those if you can buy the the S&P
[40:18] 500? But they're there. People are
[40:21] making money off that. So it's fun. It's
[40:23] entertaining. I want more of that. I
[40:25] want more [ __ ] coins. Like do it. It's
[40:28] going to keep the market clean. The free
[40:30] market behavior and and free market is
[40:32] fun. Yeah. Wh why not? Why would you
[40:35] want to get rid of that? This is the
[40:38] This is the most entertaining stuff I
[40:40] have seen ever since the Cold War and I
[40:43] was there for six years of it. Just my
[40:45] opinion. I love your I love your
[40:47] opinions. That's why I invited you back
[40:48] because it's it's for me it's fun to
[40:51] interview you. Um, one one thing I I
[40:54] want to get a a little bit deeper on is
[40:58] uh, Bitcoin in Europe. Um, because there
[41:02] is some interesting things happening for
[41:04] for example in Swiss um, in Lugano uh,
[41:07] there's a lot happening even in Czech
[41:10] where always the big conferences and and
[41:12] where the central banker even talks
[41:15] about maybe adopting Bitcoin and stuff
[41:17] like that. How do you look at Bitcoin in
[41:19] in Europe? Okay. Um, from a political
[41:23] point of view, Bitcoin was extremely
[41:26] interesting because it showed us that
[41:28] Europe is not the EU. It never has been,
[41:31] never will be, and they can try all they
[41:35] want. Czech people will never be German
[41:37] people, and that's a good thing. They
[41:40] don't want to be. It has shown us
[41:42] because all the different governments
[41:45] have reacted differently. The people
[41:47] reacted differently and so on and so
[41:49] forth.
[41:50] Germany has a lot more Bitcoin users
[41:54] based on nodes than the Czech Republic,
[41:57] even by a per capita basis as far as I
[41:59] know, but the government seems to be
[42:01] extremely hostile on it. At the same
[42:04] time, the Czech Republic doesn't have
[42:05] that many Bitcoin nodes or users, but
[42:07] the government doesn't seem to give a
[42:09] crap. Currently, we we if you want to
[42:12] talk about the great schism, I think
[42:14] we're going to see a great schism
[42:15] between the west and the
[42:17] east with Western Europe becoming more
[42:20] hostile towards Bitcoin before they
[42:22] finally bend the knee and Eastern Europe
[42:27] not not being that hostile and not
[42:29] having to bend the knee because they
[42:31] can't afford it. Western Europe can't
[42:34] afford it. Western Europe, those are
[42:36] what I like to call legacy countries.
[42:39] Legacy countries are countries that are
[42:42] skirting by by their past success. Like,
[42:45] well, we're Germany, we're Britain,
[42:48] we're France, we're great, we've always
[42:50] been great, we don't need this. Yeah,
[42:51] you do. Yeah, you do. While Eastern
[42:54] Europe is is still has this memory of
[42:58] being
[42:59] underappreciated, of being taken for
[43:02] granted. So, they're much more open to
[43:05] not resisting new stuff. That's the only
[43:07] thing I think Bitcoin will do in in
[43:09] Europe. But this is the cool thing about
[43:11] Bitcoin. Doesn't matter what happens in
[43:14] Europe. It really doesn't. What? Because
[43:16] there is there is North America. There
[43:18] is South America. There is Southeast
[43:20] Asia. China might be coming back. There
[43:22] is Japan. There is Australia. Yada yada
[43:24] yada yada yada. So I don't need it to
[43:26] work here. I have my exit plan. I have
[43:29] three passports. I have two residence
[43:31] permits. And I can move. And throughout
[43:34] history, the foot vote has always been
[43:36] the one that counts for most. Plan B is
[43:38] also something uh super interesting
[43:40] where we can get into that uh later. But
[43:43] one more thing, um do you think the EU
[43:46] will disintegrate? I really don't know.
[43:49] I I can't decide. I hope they will. I
[43:51] really do. But um if they will, they
[43:55] will disintegrate from the east to the
[43:57] west. It is much more likely that it
[43:59] will splinter into different parts.
[44:02] And we already we are already seeing
[44:04] this. Eastern Europe is getting really
[44:07] fed up with Brussels
[44:09] um with with Hungary leading the charge.
[44:12] But Hungary isn't the only one. Hungary
[44:14] is just a flag bearer. You can for some
[44:17] weird reason I don't know why Hungary is
[44:19] not the strongest economy. It's not the
[44:21] biggest economy. There'll be Poland
[44:23] there. But for some
[44:26] reason they are punching way above their
[44:29] weight. And I'm not saying this because
[44:32] my name
[44:33] is Yeah. Whatever. Vic, they always wait
[44:37] for Victor Orban to come out, spit into
[44:40] the faces of the people in Brussels, and
[44:42] as soon as he does it, they all pull
[44:44] after. So I think that I think the EU
[44:48] completely disintegrating has a lower
[44:50] chance of the EU splintering. Like
[44:51] suddenly you have the Vishagrati group
[44:53] that make their own thing. Western
[44:55] Europe stays together. There are a few
[44:57] outliers like Switzerland and
[44:58] Likenstein.
[45:01] I think that's much more likely. I hope
[45:03] that they disintegrate. I think I I
[45:05] still maintain that the British did the
[45:06] right thing getting out of there, except
[45:08] they're not reaping the benefits because
[45:10] their own government is
[45:12] completely completely um beyond
[45:15] themselves. I mean, Kier Starmer is
[45:18] doing a great job removing the last
[45:20] vestigages of their greatness. Yeah,
[45:22] it's crazy what's what's happening. I I
[45:24] don't hear anything positive from the
[45:25] from the UK. you you you hear news from
[45:28] the UK and it's always oh someone got
[45:31] arrested for tweets, someone did that
[45:33] and it's it's never a a good story in my
[45:37] eyes at least. The U the UK, Canada and
[45:40] Australia are on the best way to become
[45:42] totalitarian [ __ ] holes. I mean, um, I
[45:47] don't know how many of those news
[45:49] articles tell the whole
[45:51] story, but you always see these
[45:54] comparisons, you know, these comparisons
[45:56] that they make
[45:58] for some dude has done a bad post on
[46:01] Facebook and gets five years in prison.
[46:03] I'm just making this up now, but this is
[46:05] the gist of it. Gets five years in
[46:07] prison. And then you have some guy who
[46:10] raped two children and he gets six
[46:12] months on probation. I don't know, but
[46:15] this is the way it goes. And I don't
[46:18] know how long they can keep it up
[46:19] because the people are getting restless.
[46:22] And we still remember how to make
[46:24] guillotines. It's not that hard. The
[46:27] French have proven that it can be done.
[46:28] It can be done again. Yeah, that that's
[46:31] an interesting interesting point. Let's
[46:34] coming to the point of plan B. How
[46:36] important or let's start differently.
[46:38] Why did you say okay, I want to have a
[46:40] plan B. I want to have different
[46:42] passports. because I want to have uh
[46:44] protection against where I live. Okay,
[46:47] let's let's turn this into an economic
[46:49] back and
[46:50] forth.
[46:51] Um, do you think that the place where
[46:54] you live has a higher than zero chance
[46:58] of becoming unlivable for you? I'm not
[47:02] You don't have to tell me the exact
[47:03] number. You're just telling me does it
[47:06] have a higher than zero chance.
[47:08] Absolutely. Okay, fair enough. Good. So,
[47:11] it has a higher than zero chance. Good,
[47:13] good, good, good, good. Now, how much
[47:16] would you be willing to pay in order to
[47:19] offset that risk? You don't have to tell
[47:22] me how much. You don't have to tell me.
[47:24] I'm just going to start throwing around
[47:26] numbers. Would you, whatever that risk
[47:29] is, would you be willing to pay 5
[47:32] million euros in order to offset that
[47:34] risk?
[47:36] I couldn't. Okay, you can't. Fine. 1
[47:40] million euros. 500,000? No. €250,000?
[47:46] Getting close about. No.
[47:49] 150,000. Uh, still no. €100,000.
[47:54] Yeah. Okay. For €100,000, there are
[47:58] several jurisdictions on this planet
[47:59] where you can get a residence permit.
[48:01] Now, this is you. This is you. Um, there
[48:05] are other people who can afford all of
[48:08] these options.
[48:10] So why wouldn't they? They just never
[48:12] thought about it. For 5 million, you can
[48:14] get this new, what is it? Golden visa
[48:16] that the US just introduced where you
[48:19] just get residence without tax stuff. I
[48:21] don't know if it's already online, but
[48:22] they're they're discussing it. For
[48:26] 500,000, you can already get passports
[48:28] in a couple of countries. For €250
[48:31] to€150,000, you can get a citizenship in
[48:34] a Caribbean island. All we do is offset
[48:36] risk. Now, me, I was able to offset risk
[48:42] through um means that weren't that that
[48:45] expensive. I got my Hungarian passport
[48:48] back because my grandparents never gave
[48:50] it up. That was a genius move by me.
[48:52] Thank you very much. I got yet another
[48:55] passport due to my family from a country
[48:57] which I'm not going to mention because
[48:59] it's very
[49:01] unhealthy. And um I married a Chinese
[49:04] girl.
[49:06] she had the opportunity to get
[49:08] naturalized in Switzerland. She didn't.
[49:11] We discussed it. Why not? Because she
[49:13] would lose her Chinese
[49:15] passport. But as long as she has her
[49:17] Chinese passport, I can move to China
[49:20] with her whenever I want. Some people
[49:22] might say, "Well, ch would you go to
[49:24] China?" It's an option. I just want
[49:26] options. Then I was one of the last
[49:29] people who got residence in Paraguay.
[49:33] Paraguay up until one and a half years
[49:35] ago offered a permanent residence permit
[49:38] if you deposited $5,000 with them. I did
[49:41] that. I have Paraguayan residence. So
[49:43] wait, 5,000 and you get a permanent.
[49:45] Wow, that's low. Yep. Just residence
[49:48] permit. Paraguay. El Salvador, one
[49:50] bitcoin, you can get
[49:52] residence.
[49:53] So I all I had to do for one of those
[49:57] things was go to the embassy and show
[49:59] that my grandparents were Hungarian.
[50:00] Risk offset for Western Europe. Okay, I
[50:04] had to fly down to Paraguay with my
[50:06] stuff, get a lawyer, pay $5,000, and I
[50:08] got a residence permit. Offset the risk
[50:10] again for just $5,000 plus the flight,
[50:13] plus the hotel, and I had a great time.
[50:15] Paraguay is great, by the way.
[50:17] Absolutely lovely country, very
[50:19] conservative, people are down to earth,
[50:21] and by discussing it with my wife, we
[50:24] were able to reserve the right to go to
[50:26] China if necessary. So, I have four
[50:29] options and it cost me
[50:31] what? 15,000. I offset the risk. Yeah,
[50:34] it has this uh losing passport. I think
[50:36] that's still uh a law in Austria where
[50:40] you cannot have a second one. There are
[50:41] some exceptions to it. Uh I never read
[50:44] into it very deeply, but there are
[50:45] exceptions to it. Um but they are mostly
[50:48] not allowing it. One question and I'm
[50:51] not say I'm not I'm not indicating how
[50:53] how would they know? I have no clue. How
[50:56] would they know? Like if bec um how do I
[50:59] word this so I don't get into
[51:02] trouble? Theoretically speaking, if I
[51:05] had a friend in Austria who bought
[51:07] himself one of those Caribbean
[51:10] citizenships, how would it be possible
[51:12] that he's still having both citizenships
[51:14] four years after the fact? Just a
[51:16] hypothetical. How would they know? There
[51:18] are ways how how governments can know.
[51:20] The Chinese, they are
[51:22] pretty harsh on that. If you take up
[51:26] Swiss citizenship when you fly back and
[51:29] you don't have a visa stamp or your
[51:31] residence permit, they will ask you,
[51:32] "How the hell did you get into
[51:33] Switzerland?" And then you have to come
[51:36] clean. But other than that, nah. Why
[51:39] would you know? It's even it's even
[51:41] easier than that. Even the Chinese
[51:43] cannot control it. Um I know of a couple
[51:47] married. They're Chinese. They have they
[51:51] have Caribbean residence, their
[51:53] Caribbean passport. they bought it. They
[51:55] always fly over Europe. Once they fly
[51:57] over Europe, they get a visa for Europe.
[51:59] And when they fly back to China from
[52:01] Europe, they present the visa. The
[52:02] Chinese don't know that they have
[52:04] citizenship in the Caribbean. That's
[52:05] interesting. Now, I I'm too good of a
[52:09] citizens, I think. Yeah, that's a bad
[52:11] thing. No, because I I I literally never
[52:14] thought about like because for example,
[52:16] there are like uh many friendly uh
[52:19] country visas in many places. for
[52:21] example, Panama, uh, which costs not a
[52:24] lot of money. I think the last time I
[52:27] checked, there was offers like around
[52:29] 30,000 with everything done actually.
[52:32] Um, which then you can actually be there
[52:34] and and and do things. But I was like,
[52:37] oh, I will lose my awesome passport. I'm
[52:40] like, okay, but m maybe I
[52:43] don't how do they how do they know? So,
[52:46] this weren't the way to go. Like I said,
[52:48] there are countries that offer residence
[52:49] permits which you can technically buy. I
[52:52] went to Paraguay because you don't have
[52:53] to live there. You get the residence
[52:55] permit. I don't I have to go there once
[52:57] every two years and it stays valid.
[53:00] There are countries in Southeast Asia
[53:02] that have similar kinds of programs. Um
[53:04] go online, look it up, choose pick your
[53:06] poison and then go with it or don't.
[53:09] Interesting. Yeah, it's important I
[53:12] think. Yeah, absolutely. And I I did
[53:14] this in order to offset risk. I'm still
[53:16] in Switzerland. I I hope I don't have to
[53:18] leave. I hope I don't have to leave. I
[53:20] will probably leave when I reach
[53:22] retirement age because um living out
[53:25] retirement in Switzerland from a fiscal
[53:27] point of view is suicide. But it's
[53:29] expensive in Switzerland. Well, not just
[53:32] that, you get more bang for your buck
[53:35] abroad. I mean, people are people are
[53:38] always looking down on those who do it.
[53:41] I have I have a colleague
[53:43] who who got who who got retired. He
[53:46] retired like six months ago. He had this
[53:50] all planned out. He moved to Thailand.
[53:52] He's a Bitcoiner, too, by the way. He
[53:55] moved to Thailand with his wife. Now,
[53:58] why would he do that? He did that
[53:59] because his pension there gets him more
[54:03] bang for his buck. And I don't mean in
[54:05] the sexual way. I mean he can afford lot
[54:08] more. And we see this all over the
[54:11] place. We see it in Germany is a
[54:13] particularly sad
[54:14] example. Um the the German government
[54:18] decades ago has basically convinced the
[54:20] German citizens to stop planning for
[54:23] their own retirement and just give it to
[54:25] the government. And now retirees are
[54:28] getting absolutely nothing. You
[54:31] got poor old people who were who worked
[54:34] for 30 years as plumbers, as carpenters,
[54:37] and they can't afford anything anymore.
[54:39] It's quite sad. There are documentaries
[54:41] about this. What do these people do?
[54:43] They go to Bulgaria. Just the power
[54:46] purchase
[54:47] parity, the value of that retirement
[54:49] allows them to live a more dignified
[54:51] life in
[54:53] Bulgaria. And this is going to play out
[54:57] really badly for legacy countries in the
[55:00] future because if let's say Europe goes
[55:03] full full fascist like no you we won't
[55:06] accept
[55:07] Bitcoin we will regulate the hell out of
[55:10] it. We're going to make your life
[55:12] hard. Bitcoiners will be able to go to
[55:15] places that accept Bitcoin and the
[55:17] places that are generally poorer will be
[55:20] much more incentivized to accept Bitcoin
[55:23] and where you can live with your
[55:25] Bitcoin. Of course, that is only if you
[55:28] want to use your Bitcoin up. Um, the
[55:31] next big thing will be income from
[55:33] Bitcoin and there is already a way to do
[55:35] that, but it's still in the making. So
[55:37] much for plan B. It's just offsetting
[55:40] risk, exercising the footnote. And the
[55:42] footnote has always put the screws on
[55:45] governments. That is why governments
[55:46] absolutely hate it. Governments hate the
[55:48] foot vote. That the the Berlin wall was
[55:51] not built to keep the the West Germans
[55:55] from getting into East Germany. Okay.
[55:59] Uh that's why it's so important to have
[56:02] Bitcoin. It's it's it's probably for me
[56:04] at least the most important uh tool of
[56:07] of freedom. And there are a lot of tools
[56:09] as we discussed plan B and and and other
[56:11] things or or skills uh that you can that
[56:15] you can acquire by or like with with
[56:17] time that you can acquire uh to have
[56:20] those freedom tools. But for me, Bitcoin
[56:23] is so fundamental because if you don't
[56:25] own your money, they can rip your your
[56:27] your whole life out with with with one
[56:30] ward. I mean, we have now seen an
[56:34] example of of how strong this is. There
[56:37] is this, if you put that into your
[56:38] browser again, there is this one guy who
[56:40] has been ordered by a court in Puerto
[56:43] Rico, I think, to hand over his
[56:46] Bitcoin and he said no. And they can't
[56:50] take it from him. So instead, they
[56:52] imposed a fine of $10,000 a day. Now,
[56:55] sure, you can do that, but what it shows
[56:57] is if you don't give them the code, they
[57:01] cannot take possession of it.
[57:04] It's one guy, but this guy has proven if
[57:07] you take your security
[57:10] seriously. If you follow all the
[57:12] steps, then the government cannot take
[57:16] it. They can try to coersse you, but you
[57:19] still need to actually hand it
[57:21] over. This this one guy um the fine is I
[57:24] know that the fine is $10,000 a day. The
[57:27] court ordered him to hand over the
[57:29] Bitcoin. He refused and they can't take
[57:32] it. They can only try to curse him into
[57:34] giving it up, but they can't take it.
[57:36] So, if you are able to remember 24
[57:39] words, you can get out of somewhere and
[57:41] go to somewhere else and then your
[57:43] Bitcoin is still yours. Yeah. It's the
[57:45] one currency, the the one asset that you
[57:47] can even take to your grave if you
[57:49] really want to do to do that. Nobody
[57:52] People can still shoot you. People can
[57:54] still arrest you and stuff. The $5
[57:56] crowbar attack is still a thing. Yeah.
[57:59] Yeah. Exactly. But but you can choose to
[58:02] die with your Bitcoin. You can choose to
[58:04] to to keep them uh with everything else
[58:07] with like gold, houses, real estate,
[58:10] cars, whatever. They can shoot you in
[58:12] the head and and they just have have it
[58:14] then. It's the only asset that you have
[58:17] full control over as long as you have
[58:19] control over your own
[58:21] thoughts. So yeah, in that case, it's an
[58:23] absolute paradigm shift. And this will
[58:27] happen if if the if any if any
[58:30] jurisdiction decides to become too effed
[58:33] up for their own good, people will
[58:35] choose to leave and you can't stop them.
[58:37] Amazing. Um, one last topic before we
[58:40] come to the end. Uh, I want to get in
[58:43] there. Um, I'm really obsessed with
[58:46] medium of exchange use case these days
[58:48] of of of Bitcoin. How important is that
[58:52] for the overall story of of Bitcoin? So,
[58:56] we actually also spend it and and use it
[58:58] as as a currency or as a yeah money.
[59:00] Well, the original white paper from
[59:03] Satoshi Nakamoto says that it's a
[59:05] peer-to-peer exchange. So, it's meant to
[59:08] be a medium of
[59:10] exchange. Now, we hit a little bit of a
[59:13] brick wall because of the block size
[59:15] stuff because it's hard to actually
[59:17] transfer it. that has been solved by by
[59:21] light by the lightning
[59:23] network. So in the future, if Bitcoin is
[59:26] going to have
[59:27] any usability, I hate that word
[59:31] usability, it will have to make inroads
[59:33] into becoming a medium of exchange. And
[59:36] if you go with what the Austrian school
[59:38] says, it should because the medium of
[59:40] exchange is simply the most salailable
[59:42] good. And Bitcoin is the most salailable
[59:45] good. Well, first we're gonna have that
[59:48] whole spiel of good money drowning out
[59:50] bad money. People trying to get rid of
[59:53] all other mediums of
[59:55] exchange and then Bitcoin will come in.
[59:57] But we're already seeing that. I mean,
[60:00] you can buy stuff with Bitcoin online
[60:03] already. There are places that accept
[60:06] lightning, but this is slow process.
[60:08] People need to get used to it. It takes
[60:10] time. Yeah. It's it's it's not a
[60:13] overnight thing. We are we are if you if
[60:17] you see how long gold took I mean it's a
[60:20] different world now but if you see how
[60:22] long this took it will take time with
[60:24] with Bitcoin too and it's it's a
[60:27] powerful thing um I now have with my
[60:33] small podcast business um income most of
[60:37] the income actually in Bitcoin and also
[60:40] I'm now starting to uh pay things and
[60:44] pay people in Bitcoin. So there's
[60:47] already some money streams that never
[60:50] touch the fiat systems and those money
[60:54] flows that never touch the fiat system
[60:56] are actually getting bigger. Uh I mean
[60:58] I'm a special special case because I
[61:01] work for Bitcoin companies. I I I'm in
[61:04] deact only with Bitcoiners basically uh
[61:07] in the business world. Uh so I I know
[61:09] I'm I'm probably a little further ahead
[61:12] of the adoption curve. Um, but this
[61:16] shows me how powerful this is. I can
[61:19] have my bank account being on a metal
[61:22] plate and just operate it by a phone uh
[61:25] whenever I want. To be realistic, right
[61:27] now Bitcoin is more of a store of value.
[61:30] Nobody, you can't argue with that. The
[61:33] question is how fast will the transition
[61:35] take place? And I think it'll take up
[61:37] speed, especially because it's
[61:39] borderless. It's losing its bad name. We
[61:43] have some positive feedback from the US
[61:46] due to it's a Bitcoin
[61:49] reserve. So that's all good. I'm here
[61:51] for it. The question will be at a later
[61:54] point whether you can generate actual
[61:56] passive income with Bitcoin. Now there
[61:59] are some inroads that being made with
[62:01] this with
[62:02] MSTY which is an interesting
[62:05] concept but it'll take a lot of time and
[62:09] quite frankly even if it doesn't if we
[62:13] can tie second layer stuff to Bitcoin
[62:16] and then use it within a normal banking
[62:19] environment why not I mean it has been
[62:21] done
[62:22] before back when people were still using
[62:26] gold paper money was just a second layer
[62:29] on gold and it worked fine until the
[62:31] government effed it up but it worked
[62:33] fine. That's interesting. Uh MSD wise I
[62:36] think uh an interesting topic uh uh give
[62:40] people an background because I think
[62:42] almost nobody knows about it. I also
[62:44] never really researched um what is that
[62:47] that thing again um to completely
[62:50] explain it would be would be like a
[62:53] twohour thing. It has already been
[62:56] explained a lot better again by uh
[62:59] what's his name? British Hodel. So I'm
[63:01] going to keep this real
[63:03] short. One of the main things was
[63:06] Bitcoin did not
[63:07] generate income. Can't can't generate
[63:12] income. But when the ETF came out, it
[63:15] opened Bitcoin as I said in our last
[63:18] meeting to every financial instrument
[63:21] that there is which includes options.
[63:24] Now, MSTY is an instrument where you
[63:27] essentially can pay into and due to
[63:30] options tradings, it will generate an
[63:32] about 7%
[63:34] income on your Bitcoin. They pay out
[63:37] every month. So, this is a way for
[63:39] people to generate income from Bitcoin.
[63:43] The downside is it sacrifices upside and
[63:47] downside volatility. And the general way
[63:50] Bitcoin goes is upside. So you get a
[63:53] certain amount of income but you are
[63:56] foregoing any value gain that Bitcoin
[63:59] has over the long run. Depends what you
[64:01] want. Depends what you want. If you say
[64:04] I have enough Bitcoin and I don't want
[64:06] to spend that Bitcoin because I want to
[64:09] keep that Bitcoin, then you just put a
[64:11] lot of more fiat into MSTY and you get a
[64:14] steady income and you don't have to use
[64:15] up your Bitcoin.
[64:18] If not, you will have to sell some of
[64:20] your Bitcoin every now and then in order
[64:22] to keep yourself alive. As of now, it's
[64:25] the only and in my
[64:27] opinion best instrument there is. So, if
[64:30] you want to generate income and you
[64:33] don't want to sell your Bitcoin, buy
[64:34] MSTY. That's it. That's the short
[64:36] version. And I think there is so much
[64:41] more coming. I think if we look into
[64:44] five five 10 years MSTY was um I think
[64:48] it was I think it's it's Mister it's
[64:51] from Sailor.
[64:53] Now, if this thing takes off, um it's
[64:56] not going to take long for Black Rockck
[64:58] to do something similar or bitwise, but
[65:02] it will be possible to gain income on
[65:06] Bitcoin in the in the confines of an ETF
[65:10] as long as you are willing to sacrifice
[65:13] the upside momentum for it. And that can
[65:15] be a very valid thing to do depending on
[65:18] where you stand in life. Because if
[65:20] let's say if you are 80 years old, if
[65:25] you're 80 years old, then you can start
[65:27] selling unless you want to give it hand
[65:28] it over to your kids. But if you don't
[65:30] have any kids, just sell the Bitcoin.
[65:32] Unless you want to take it into your
[65:33] grave and lower the total amount a
[65:36] little bit more for the rest of us. But
[65:39] if you have another 50 years to go and
[65:41] you want a steady income, you don't want
[65:43] to sell the Bitcoin you already have,
[65:45] then you buy MSTY and you have an income
[65:47] with it. It's absolutely valid. depends
[65:49] on your on where you are in life and I'm
[65:51] not telling other people what to do
[65:53] because other people are not me. I know
[65:56] shocking. They definitely aren't you.
[65:58] Um really cool. I have now a new
[66:02] question that I think for the first in
[66:04] the first round I actually did not ask
[66:06] uh that I now ask since uh almost a few
[66:09] hundred episodes every guest and the
[66:11] question is what can we learn from you
[66:13] besides Bitcoin? What can you learn from
[66:15] you besides Bitcoin? Don't wait too long
[66:18] to get um a polish cream for your bald
[66:22] head. I have been shaving my head for
[66:25] over a decade and I was very very
[66:27] machismo about it. So I shave it, it
[66:31] bleeds a little bit and I rinse it off
[66:33] and that's it. And three months ago, a
[66:37] colleague of
[66:38] mine who is even more macho than me. I
[66:41] know I am just I'm so an alpha male, but
[66:45] he told me I should really start using a
[66:48] cream for my bald head. So I finally
[66:51] gave in and bought
[66:52] one, moisturizing cream. And I have to
[66:55] say it changed my life. This is so good.
[67:00] And um don't don't underestimate the
[67:03] power of male hygiene and care products
[67:07] because after that after I started that
[67:09] I started using cream on my face. I am
[67:11] over 40 years old now and I wish I had
[67:14] started earlier. It's something that we
[67:17] men are neglecting. We're absolutely
[67:19] neglecting it and I think we should
[67:21] start earlier with it. So you I I I
[67:24] don't know how young you are. Not going
[67:26] to ask for your age. 26. Okay. you
[67:29] you're very fresh. Um, do yourself a
[67:32] favor right now. Do you have a skin care
[67:34] regimen?
[67:36] Yeah, I actually have, but not because I
[67:39] I I my girlfriend is Indian and uh I I
[67:44] still don't reveal her on the channel,
[67:46] but uh she has a skin care and yeah, she
[67:50] knows more than you. And trust me, there
[67:53] is nothing wrong as a man to have a full
[67:56] and abs and and fitting skin care
[67:59] regimen. You will thank me later. Your
[68:02] girlfriend is going to thank me later.
[68:04] All the single guys out there, if you
[68:06] just take a little bit care of your
[68:08] skin, it'll make such a difference. That
[68:11] is something that I want to put out
[68:12] there in the world because I wish I had
[68:14] started earlier because I haven't. This
[68:17] is the result. Now all I can do is
[68:20] maintenance. How many steps are you
[68:22] doing? H how many steps in the skincare
[68:26] routine are you doing? My my girlfriend
[68:28] is always obsessed with like how many
[68:29] steps somebody is doing. I don't I never
[68:31] counted. I just know is I have one for
[68:34] this when I shave it. I have a facial
[68:37] cream and I have a moisturizing cream
[68:39] and I apply them now religiously every
[68:41] evening.
[68:42] Yeah. I I I um because it's also very
[68:46] important for her that I do something
[68:48] for my skin because he's like she's
[68:50] saying she had very bad skin and she had
[68:53] dealing with the skin since like 15
[68:55] years old and she had improved her skin
[68:57] massively. I saw the skin how it was
[68:59] before and how it is now. It's it's
[69:01] really great how her skin got better and
[69:05] uh she's like you're blessed with great
[69:08] skin so don't mess it up. Uh and I now
[69:12] started since like I think half a year
[69:14] or like maybe 8 months or something like
[69:16] that. I do the skincare. I do three
[69:19] steps. I do washing it. Mhm. Never wash.
[69:22] Do that anyway. But no no like washing
[69:25] it with
[69:27] like I never washed my water was the
[69:31] only thing I put on my skin before and
[69:33] then I do a serum and then I do
[69:35] moisturizing like very very easy done in
[69:38] like three minutes. What else can you
[69:40] learn from me? I can be a cautionary
[69:42] tale. This is the result of not caring
[69:46] for your
[69:48] skin. Take me as a as a as a very bad
[69:52] case study. This is how you will end up
[69:56] if you don't do it. Now look look at
[70:00] this guy. This is what you can maintain
[70:03] if you start doing it. So many lives
[70:06] could have been saved if I had admitted
[70:08] to myself that it is not unmanly to take
[70:11] care of my skin.
[70:14] Another thing uh my my hair is starting
[70:16] to fall out, especially in uh back
[70:18] there. Go bald. Go bald. Go bald.
[70:22] Yeah. Yeah. But uh my girlfriend also
[70:24] doesn't like that. So I'm actually
[70:25] starting to um How is that thing called?
[70:28] Not not shampoo. Um Oh gosh. How is that
[70:31] thing called that you put on there? I
[70:33] have no idea. A conditioner.
[70:35] Conditioner. Conditioner. No. Um, this
[70:38] look I will die. This is the ideal male
[70:42] male um
[70:44] haircut. You may not like it, but that's
[70:48] how it is. And I will die on that hill.
[70:50] This has made my life so much better.
[70:53] I had um I was bold for I think like I I
[70:58] once was bold and and let it grow out
[71:01] again in in in the co time around 2020
[71:04] and it was really great like you you
[71:07] stand up you go for a short shower and
[71:10] it's like you don't have to mess with
[71:12] your hair and my hair is is always
[71:14] weird. I never regretted starting to
[71:17] shave my head. I do regret it I didn't
[71:20] start with the with the bald the bald
[71:22] stuff there the cream that I put on now
[71:24] which is specifically for the head wish
[71:26] I saw that that's what you can learn
[71:28] from me I never thought that we will uh
[71:31] talk about skin care and uh in in the
[71:34] end but it was it's a fun you asked you
[71:37] asked I I I do enjoy it I do enjoy it uh
[71:41] it was a it was a fun podcast with you
[71:43] uh Mike we have an end routine in the
[71:45] podcast as I did it also last time where
[71:48] a previous guest is asking a question
[71:49] for the next guest without knowing who
[71:51] the next guest actually is. Uh, and this
[71:54] is an interesting one. What is the best
[71:57] thing someone can do for Bitcoin? Okay.
[72:00] I I I used to be into grand
[72:02] gestures.
[72:04] Um, maybe it's because I'm getting
[72:06] older. I'm no longer into grand
[72:09] gestures. I think the best thing you can
[72:11] do in it, everything starts at home. I
[72:16] think the best thing you can do is talk
[72:18] to your friends and your family where
[72:21] you actually have skin in the game and
[72:23] convince them and then convince yourself
[72:26] that that's enough. There are people who
[72:28] are already doing grand things. You're
[72:31] not going to be the next Na Kelly.
[72:33] You're not going to be the next Michael
[72:35] Sailor. You can try if you want to and I
[72:37] wish you the best of it. But for people
[72:40] like you and me, the best thing you can
[72:42] do is to take care and inform and help
[72:45] the people around you who are closest to
[72:47] you and who you care about. That has a
[72:51] much greater impact, I think, than
[72:54] trying to go outside and change the
[72:57] world. There's there's this famous
[72:59] saying, I don't know where it comes
[73:00] from. Everyone everybody wants to save
[73:03] the world, but nobody wants to help mom
[73:04] do the dishes. If you if you want to if
[73:07] you want to change the world, start with
[73:08] your neighborhood.
[73:10] So I I have I have gained I have I had
[73:14] this this
[73:15] this time where I have felt this
[73:18] incessant need um I closed it down since
[73:21] then to post on X and Facebook. I used
[73:25] to have an account and in every group it
[73:28] doesn't matter. I had much greater
[73:31] success and enjoyment and satisfaction
[73:33] and catharsis when I was talking to my
[73:36] mother explained it to her and she told
[73:39] me you know what okay I'll try it and
[73:41] she's still growing strong did the same
[73:44] for my brother did the same to a close
[73:46] friend of mine that has given me much
[73:48] more satisfaction that is the best thing
[73:49] you can do for Bitcoin by helping your
[73:52] immediate friends and family and the
[73:54] people you care about which is a perfect
[73:56] um transition to the last thing I
[73:59] usually asked the guest where they can
[74:01] reach you best. But uh you don't have
[74:03] anything where where people can reach
[74:04] you. Um you can reach me
[74:07] under bald guy
[74:10] at
[74:11] [Music]
[74:13] adv.ch. That's bald guy just one word at
[74:20] adv.ch I will get your email. Perfect.
[74:23] Then uh we we have a we have a contact
[74:26] for you and and people can contact you
[74:28] if they really want to and uh may uh
[74:31] maybe they can also just write a comment
[74:32] and then you can see it also. Really
[74:34] cool. Thank you so much um Mike for
[74:37] being on. Also, thank you so much for
[74:39] everyone that is uh watching and
[74:40] listening for joining us today. As
[74:42] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[74:44] another episode. Bye-bye. Thank you.
[74:46] [Music]
