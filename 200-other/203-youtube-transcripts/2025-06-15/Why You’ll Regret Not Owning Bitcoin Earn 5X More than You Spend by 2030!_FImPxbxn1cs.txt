--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] in the early 2030s, it would be crazy
[00:02] for you to not have at least some
[00:04] Bitcoin. There'll be seasons and times
[00:06] in your life where you where you need to
[00:08] spend down. You know, if you're you're
[00:09] getting married or having a child or
[00:10] these kinds of things. I mean, there'll
[00:12] be expenses and you might need to spend
[00:14] some down at that point, but then
[00:15] hopefully you're earning back at some
[00:17] other point. And there's also a time and
[00:19] a place to do certain things that you
[00:21] know maybe you can only do certain
[00:22] things when you're young and physically
[00:24] able and when you're older you know
[00:25] maybe it's a different activity or it's
[00:27] just not the same thing that you can do
[00:28] and you slow and people slow down over
[00:30] time as they age anyway. Yes, there are
[00:32] the people who just kind of learn about
[00:34] Bitcoin and they go all in and they go
[00:36] really soon in like in the space of 6
[00:38] months to a year like they've they've
[00:41] gone down that orange pill journey and
[00:42] they're all in. But not everyone's going
[00:44] to be like that, right? I think the more
[00:45] likely is sort of diminishing returns,
[00:48] diminishing volatility and that is what
[00:49] we've seen that's objectively
[00:50] statistically that is what we have seen
[00:52] over the last let's say 15 16 years that
[00:54] Bitcoin has had a price I think a lot of
[00:56] people will get on boarded in custodial
[00:58] ways now that may be triggering or
[01:01] annoying to us because we would like
[01:02] them to learn the self-custodial way.
[01:07] [Music]
[01:09] you're you're a legend in the in the
[01:11] space and uh I I watched uh your and and
[01:15] Sailor's course, the Sailor Academy on
[01:18] on Bitcoin is is really cool. Uh it's
[01:21] often a point of like, okay, if someone
[01:23] wants to dive deeper, it's like, hey,
[01:25] this is a a 12-hour course. It is really
[01:27] good in in giving you the fundamentals.
[01:28] So, really really cool that you you
[01:30] brought that to the community. Yeah,
[01:32] thank you. Yeah, I mean it was great. Uh
[01:35] oh, that that brings me back. That was
[01:37] what was that late 2020, early 2020,
[01:40] 2021 around there. Um, Michael asked me
[01:44] to make a course and at that time it was
[01:46] just, you know, that was kind of the
[01:47] brief. It was like make a 12-hour intro
[01:50] and um I pulled some pieces together and
[01:53] there you go. And I worked with some of
[01:54] the guys from the Sailor Academy course
[01:57] and uh yeah, it's it's interesting to
[01:59] see that uh even these years on people
[02:01] are still uh still looking at it.
[02:04] Yeah, I was I was orange built in a 2020
[02:07] era. So, it was right at that time. So,
[02:09] it was really helpful for me. I think I
[02:11] watched it probably 2021 somewhere a
[02:13] little bit later in my orange building.
[02:15] Uh but it I think it's a really uh
[02:17] timeless piece and I think that's the
[02:19] the great thing of education. You can
[02:21] make things that still fit like you can
[02:23] still send it to someone in 205. there's
[02:26] you can make it even bullish and make it
[02:28] more um relatable to the to the current
[02:31] news, but you don't really have to.
[02:34] Yeah. Well, thank you. Yeah. Coming to
[02:37] 2025, what is currently the the most
[02:39] exciting thing about Bitcoin and what
[02:41] maybe also has changed since since 2020
[02:43] for for you in Bitcoin? So, yeah, for
[02:47] me, I think it's like every cycle has
[02:50] its own different story and things that
[02:52] are kind of out there. Um, I guess if
[02:55] I'm sort of zooming out and looking at
[02:57] what's happening in these cycles, I can
[03:00] sort of loosely think of it like the
[03:02] 2017 cycle was ICOs and so on. As in
[03:06] that was kind of at least in the alt
[03:08] land, that's kind of what was going on.
[03:11] Then in 2021, there was kind of all this
[03:12] like DeFi and NFTts and all this other
[03:14] stuff. And it seems this time around in
[03:18] let's say 2024, 2025, it seems to me
[03:21] more like it's the cycle of Bitcoin
[03:23] ETFs, Bitcoin treasury companies. This
[03:25] kind of thing is really big. Um but in a
[03:28] Bitcoin specific um thing, of course,
[03:31] there's also a lot of work happening on
[03:33] things like the lightning network um and
[03:36] just growth generally there. things like
[03:39] what's happening in hardware wallets and
[03:41] miniscript to make it accessible for
[03:44] people there. What's happening at let's
[03:46] say lightning in terms of with lightning
[03:49] to make the user experience better and
[03:51] getting things like people having bolt
[03:53] 12 and reusable uh human readable names
[03:57] these kinds of things. So yeah, I think
[04:00] and then even in the mining world
[04:01] there's just, you know, there there are
[04:03] efforts being made to sort of help
[04:04] decentralize as you know, things like
[04:06] ocean and demand pool are out there.
[04:09] There's bit axes and things like this.
[04:11] There's just a lot of Yeah, I guess
[04:13] these are some of the things that are I
[04:15] guess on the conversation nowadays. Um
[04:19] people are talking about well what
[04:20] should be done about censorship? what
[04:22] should be done about the mining pool um
[04:25] payout structures FPS versus the PPLNS
[04:29] and other forms or you know um things
[04:32] built based on that. So yeah, I think
[04:35] it's it's a mix of those things. Um but
[04:37] then of course at the same time it's
[04:38] like what's happening in government and
[04:40] corporate and of course high netw worth
[04:43] individuals. So I guess that's just kind
[04:45] of a flavoring of what uh what I guess
[04:48] is on a lot of people's minds. It's
[04:51] super interesting uh this cycle. I I
[04:54] talked like a few episodes ago with
[04:57] Danny from Coin Corner about that
[04:59] because he brought up an interesting
[05:01] report. Uh and he basically said like if
[05:03] you only look at retail, we're still not
[05:05] in a bull market. Seems like the bull
[05:08] market is just in the institutions and
[05:10] also like Google trends and a lot of
[05:12] other things kind of supporting that.
[05:14] Um, why do you think this is? I I like
[05:18] just a one small preface to that. I
[05:20] personally thought 100k will be a
[05:21] trigger point and I was deadly wrong
[05:23] about that. Retail didn't did not seem
[05:27] to care at all outside of the Bitcoin
[05:29] world. How do you look at uh retail is
[05:32] not really in the bull market, but
[05:33] institutions and nation states all of
[05:35] the sudden really piling in? Yeah, I
[05:38] think it sounds cliche, but it really is
[05:40] just early. Like I think it's just that
[05:41] think about when I was a noob in 2013. I
[05:46] just thought it was so obvious, right?
[05:48] Like I was shouting it from the rooftops
[05:49] and I was surprised that more people
[05:51] were just not like instantly getting it.
[05:54] Now I had a few friends who followed me
[05:56] into it and they were very thankful for
[05:57] that. But a lot of them didn't and it
[06:01] just took time. It just really it just
[06:03] takes time. Think about how much of a a
[06:07] shift it takes to really start thinking,
[06:10] okay, I'm actually going to start using
[06:13] this money that's outside of the state
[06:15] and all all these things. I think for a
[06:17] lot of people, it just it's a big lift.
[06:21] And I think maybe in the earlier years,
[06:24] we kind of hit this saturation point in
[06:26] terms of the more libertarian cipher
[06:29] punk minded people. And so now the new
[06:32] people coming in are not so libertarian
[06:34] or cipher punk or cryptography or any
[06:37] they're not so into any of those things.
[06:39] Um and so I that's been one thing that's
[06:42] maybe a little surprising to me is just
[06:44] how as an example like if you go to
[06:45] mele.space
[06:47] uh it's quite low right now. Uh there's
[06:49] not that much uh activity going on. I
[06:52] think it's because ETFs and bitcoin
[06:55] treasury companies like strategy and
[06:57] metaplanet and so
[06:58] on they are that's where a lot of the
[07:01] new people are coming at least for now.
[07:03] So I think that's why and I think that
[07:07] may come later like we may get the kind
[07:09] of retail sort of frenzy later on maybe
[07:14] later this year or early next year. uh I
[07:17] so I think I still think it's coming but
[07:19] I guess the way I'm seeing it now is
[07:23] institutions and uh the let's say the
[07:27] people who are buying ETFs um they have
[07:30] a lot of money as well and so you know
[07:34] and I think the other thing is if I
[07:37] think about it this way now of course
[07:39] from the
[07:40] decentralization point of view of course
[07:42] not your keys not your coins always uh
[07:45] always and forever ever uh
[07:48] but I think there are a lot of people
[07:51] for who in past cycles they would have
[07:54] gone to let's say Coinbase or Binance or
[07:58] whatever or BitMX maybe not BitMX but
[08:01] Coinbase and these others and Gemini and
[08:02] whatever whereas now I think a lot of
[08:04] those people are going to let's say the
[08:06] ETFs and Bitcoin treasury companies so
[08:08] it could also be that even smaller quote
[08:10] unquote retail is just buying on their
[08:13] fiat stock broking terminal or app. So,
[08:16] it could be that too. Um, so I just I
[08:20] think I'm trying
[08:21] to zoom out and stay focused on and and
[08:26] understanding what's happening. And I
[08:27] think there are times where maybe we can
[08:29] end up being caught up fighting the
[08:31] battles of the past um as an example. So
[08:35] now, of course, as to bring to again
[08:37] reiterate, not your keys, not your
[08:39] coins. And I think there will be people
[08:41] who need to learn that lesson the hard
[08:43] way. Uh um but I think we we are maybe a
[08:48] little ways off from from that uh from
[08:51] kind of the next kind of FTX style
[08:53] event. Maybe that happens. Who knows?
[08:56] Um, but I think that's why there's an
[09:00] importance to kind of teach people those
[09:02] things like, hey, not your keys, not
[09:04] your coins, or hey, learn to run your
[09:06] own Bitcoin node or hey, you know, get
[09:08] use your own hardware and this kind of,
[09:10] you know, use use the tools, learn how
[09:12] to use it for for yourself. Um, so I
[09:15] think those are all um those are all
[09:18] there, but we also can't deny that for a
[09:20] lot of people that they just find it
[09:21] more convenient, right? they may not be
[09:23] as let's say cipher punk or
[09:24] libertarian-minded and for them they're
[09:27] just happy to just buy it on buy it on a
[09:28] terminal and that's it on a stock
[09:30] broking sort of terminal or interface.
[09:33] Yeah, it makes me it's makes me really
[09:35] think of how adoption will actually
[09:38] grow. Uh because sometimes we have this
[09:40] belief and I don't I I'm not sure if it
[09:43] actually works out like that that
[09:44] everyone will understand Bitcoin to a
[09:46] certain degree. Um I actually think uh
[09:49] that there will be a small group of
[09:51] people that actually understand Bitcoin
[09:53] and the other ones just using it the
[09:55] same way as uh in internet adoption. Uh
[09:58] not everyone really understood what the
[10:00] TCPIP protocol is and in the technical
[10:03] cities but everyone likes to use
[10:05] Facebook and and WhatsApp and and all
[10:07] those applications on on top of the the
[10:09] internet layer. Uh and even when I see
[10:12] now in my family, um there are family
[10:15] members that are orange build that
[10:17] really understand it. But then there are
[10:18] family members that uh like oh like okay
[10:22] I I think Robin gets it. I I don't
[10:24] understand Bitcoin but I will buy some
[10:26] just in case I I don't miss out if if he
[10:28] gets wealthy from it. Uh and there's
[10:30] like this group uh things of it. So I'm
[10:33] I'm wondering a lot
[10:35] of how many people do we even need the
[10:38] really orange pill and and how many
[10:40] people will just follow the crowd uh
[10:42] when the Bitcoin price is going up and
[10:44] the Bitcoin gets integrated in in the
[10:47] fiat systems and those kind of adoption
[10:49] questions. Yeah, it's a good question. I
[10:51] don't know if there's any really uh good
[10:53] answer to it, but I I think I'm just
[10:57] recognizing that I think a lot of people
[10:59] will get on boarded in custodial ways.
[11:01] Now, that may be triggering or annoying
[11:04] to us because we would like them to
[11:05] learn the self-custodial way. Um but
[11:09] another way to think of it is just look
[11:11] there there were only so many people who
[11:13] were going to do it uh that way. A lot
[11:15] of people will just do it in a fiat
[11:17] custodial way. Of course, it still
[11:21] matters to teach enough people to do
[11:24] this because I think in some sense more
[11:27] people knowing how to self-custody, it
[11:29] acts as a check, right? It acts as a a
[11:32] check against the system. It acts as a
[11:33] check against fractional reserve, these
[11:35] kinds of practices. So in that sense,
[11:38] yeah, it still matters to teach people
[11:40] about these things and talk about them
[11:42] and make them uh important so that
[11:45] people understand or at least help make
[11:48] um people understand the importance of
[11:49] doing them. Um but yeah, what percent of
[11:54] people coming in do we need to teach
[11:56] that? I don't really know. Um I think
[11:58] the important thing though is that when
[12:01] you want to self custody, you know,
[12:03] people can do that. Um, and I mean, who
[12:06] knows? Maybe that prices people out over
[12:09] time. Like maybe over time, maybe not
[12:11] now, but maybe 10 years from now, maybe
[12:14] it it there will be people who are
[12:16] priced out. Uh, but we'll see. I mean,
[12:19] some of that also depends on like what
[12:20] other technology we get. Do we end up
[12:22] having some other scaling technique or
[12:26] efficiency technique that allows more
[12:28] people to use Bitcoin in a
[12:29] self-custodial way? Uh, I think it's
[12:32] kind of it's an open question for now,
[12:34] but I think I would say the way I'm sort
[12:37] of looking at it is I think there used
[12:39] to be a lot of people doing like onchain
[12:40] transactions and now it's sort of like a
[12:42] lot of those people have moved to either
[12:44] using lightning or maybe they're using
[12:46] custodial things like custodial
[12:48] lightning and so on. Um, because that I
[12:50] think that to me explains why there's so
[12:52] very there's very little onchain uh
[12:55] transactions at least right now. Um, and
[12:59] you know, maybe when retail shows up and
[13:01] maybe when some more of those people
[13:03] have learned to actually withdraw and do
[13:05] do self-custody, then they will then
[13:08] we'll start to see a pick up again. But
[13:10] maybe it's just going to be this kind of
[13:12] uh cycles kind of pendulum thing,
[13:15] pendulum swinging thing there even um in
[13:18] terms of onchain uh transactions.
[13:21] Yeah, it's kind of fascinating. I I just
[13:23] paid someone yesterday with Bitcoin. Uh
[13:26] it was I think $500. Uh and I paid.7
[13:29] cents for the transaction which is
[13:31] nothing. Uh the all the fees on the feed
[13:34] rails would have been I think three or4
[13:36] the for the same transactions. And it's
[13:39] uh it's it's kind of amazing and I love
[13:42] how uh Bob Bernette puts it like we we
[13:46] are now uh uh driving in a Rolls-Royce
[13:49] and it it won't be forever that cheap to
[13:52] drive in a Rolls-Royce on the on the
[13:54] main layer. we have to get get used to
[13:56] to the the up upper layer things. It's a
[13:58] it's an interesting time uh to be alive.
[14:01] Bitcoin price is uh um quite high for
[14:05] for the low retail uh interests I feel
[14:09] like. Um and also the the importance of
[14:13] running your own node and and self cast
[14:15] is extremely important. But I just see
[14:18] like the the it's really hard to get
[14:20] that through to to people. I made a poll
[14:23] last time. How many people uh do self
[14:26] custody that watch my channel? That's
[14:29] not even half. Uh and and I preach self
[14:31] custody almost in in every every
[14:34] episode. Uh and then if you ask like if
[14:37] if you do self custody, are you also
[14:39] running your own full note, then most
[14:42] people drop out, right? That's like
[14:44] another big filter level. Yeah. It's
[14:46] it's it's it's super important. Um, can
[14:49] you make the case for for people that
[14:50] maybe are listening now and and maybe
[14:53] don't have self-custody or only have
[14:54] self custody and and not run their own
[14:56] full full node um why they should care
[15:00] about that especially when they are so
[15:01] early in that revolution? Well,
[15:03] fundamentally it comes down to you
[15:06] having possession of your own coins
[15:08] rather than leaving them with somebody
[15:10] else, right? Like the analogy might be,
[15:13] you know, it's if you believe in, let's
[15:15] say, gun rights, but you leave your gun
[15:17] locked up at the police station nearby
[15:19] instead of, you know, having it
[15:20] available to yourself. Now, I don't
[15:22] know, maybe in some audience that might
[15:23] be a controversial kind of argument or
[15:25] statement, but I mean, the point is more
[15:27] just that if
[15:29] you, you know, really value this thing
[15:31] and you really want to make sure you
[15:32] still have control of it, then I think
[15:34] it, it benefits you to learn. Now, maybe
[15:38] for some re for some Yeah. And it could
[15:40] be that you don't necessarily have to
[15:41] self-custody 100% of your stack. Maybe
[15:43] if you are a trader, maybe you have to
[15:45] leave some of it on another platform
[15:47] somewhere or maybe you're using, I don't
[15:49] know, who knows if you're doing like a
[15:50] loan thing or whatever. But hopefully
[15:51] that's only a small percent of your
[15:53] overall holding and that you're keeping
[15:55] most of it in your self- custody so that
[15:57] way you're not uh running the risk of
[16:00] getting mount gawked or ftxed or these
[16:02] kinds of things. Um, so I think that's
[16:04] one thing. Now, I people could argue,
[16:06] okay, look, that was the past and now
[16:08] that's not as much of a risk now. I
[16:10] mean, who knows? I I think people will
[16:12] just kind of have to learn these lessons
[16:14] over and over again. So, that's one
[16:16] thing on the holding your own keys side
[16:18] of it. On the running your own Bitcoin
[16:19] node part of it, I think that part of it
[16:21] is more about making sure that you are
[16:26] being self-s sovereign as a Bitcoin
[16:28] user. You are verifying the
[16:29] transactions. You are verifying that you
[16:31] hold those coins. you're not waiting for
[16:33] somebody else that could be lying to you
[16:35] about that. So when you connect, let's
[16:39] say, your cold card with Sparrow wallet
[16:41] and you point that Sparrow wallet to
[16:43] your own Bitcoin node, it gives you just
[16:45] a much stronger level of assurance that
[16:49] yes, you really have coins. Nobody's
[16:50] lying to you about that. You got sent
[16:53] those coins correctly and validly. Um,
[16:56] so I think that's yeah, that's that's
[16:59] kind of in a nutshell that's the key
[17:01] thing. um it's hard to impress that upon
[17:05] somebody who is not that focused on that
[17:07] because maybe they've got their coins on
[17:09] whatever IBIT or whatever um other
[17:12] custodial form of Bitcoin. Um and so
[17:16] yeah, we'll just we'll just have to
[17:18] we'll just have to wait and see. But at
[17:20] the same time, I do recognize that these
[17:23] are these are often times the first
[17:26] touch point for people, right? that that
[17:27] that may be the first coin like the
[17:29] first coins people might have held
[17:30] before historically might have been on
[17:32] custodial exchanges like the you know
[17:34] the coin coin bases of the world and so
[17:36] on and others out there. Um and then
[17:39] over time it might have once that number
[17:42] rises I think let me put it this way for
[17:46] listeners if you are holding coins in
[17:50] some kind of custodial form it could
[17:52] also be that maybe this is not a large
[17:55] percent of your net worth or it's not a
[17:57] meaningful number for you and as that
[17:58] number rises right as as NGU as number
[18:01] goes up it'll start to become more
[18:04] important to you and then you'll seek
[18:07] out naturally you'll seek out ways to do
[18:09] self custody. And for a lot of people,
[18:13] they might be scared if it's their first
[18:15] time. So, you can sort of start with a
[18:17] small amount and these kinds of things.
[18:19] These are ways to ease that um
[18:22] transition. Uh but I mean that is in a
[18:26] nutshell why you should think about
[18:27] holding your own keys and running your
[18:29] own node and importantly not just
[18:31] running your node but connecting it with
[18:32] your wallet so that you are actually
[18:35] using it as part of the transaction. So
[18:37] th that's the you know that's the reason
[18:40] why
[18:42] yeah that is that there's so many
[18:43] interesting uh things in there most
[18:46] Bitcoiners don't have like 50% or 100%
[18:49] of their savings in Bitcoin uh most of
[18:52] them have just like a small portion uh
[18:54] when you look in your own own circles u
[18:57] maybe it's relatable uh but you
[18:59] mentioned something uh interesting the
[19:01] the loan thing this this idea of
[19:03] borrowing against a bitcoin I think
[19:05] that's what you're referring
[19:07] um this this gets more and more popular.
[19:09] How do you stand on that to to get um
[19:13] not yield but get get fed liquidity to
[19:16] pay for things without selling them? So
[19:19] I mean I in a sense you can think of it
[19:21] as BTC yield at the personal level. It
[19:24] is theoretical but now that said I last
[19:28] cycle around was quite cautious on this.
[19:30] I did a podcast with Andy Edstrom and I
[19:32] think we actually got lucky with the
[19:34] timing, but we basically said like don't
[19:36] get wrecked on these things and pretty
[19:37] soon after that like a bunch of these
[19:39] things all got wrecked, right? Like that
[19:41] kind of around that time, pretty soon
[19:43] after that it was like Blockfire got
[19:45] wrecked and all these various lending
[19:47] platforms and Celsius went down and
[19:49] three hours Capital went down and later
[19:51] in that cycle FTX went down in that bare
[19:53] market. Um, so there's always a risk,
[19:57] but I think I'm not opposed to people
[20:00] doing it full stop, right? There are
[20:01] these services, things like, you know,
[20:02] Unchained Capital, LEN, Hodddle Huddle,
[20:06] uh, I think Bitfinex has a borrow thing.
[20:08] Um, I know there's one called Firefish.
[20:10] Um, there's,
[20:12] uh, that Lava one as well. So, there's a
[20:15] few of these out there, and that's
[20:16] that's just the ones I can think of at
[20:18] the top of my head. I'm sure there's
[20:19] many others, but uh I'm not I guess I'm
[20:22] not opposed to people who are doing it,
[20:24] but I would caution I would make these
[20:26] few important cautions. One, make sure
[20:29] you're managing your risk by making it a
[20:31] small portion of, you know, your overall
[20:35] stack. Ideally, if you have income that
[20:37] you are using to pay that, then that can
[20:40] help you also. Um and yeah, I just
[20:44] think monitoring sort of what's
[20:47] happening there and understanding what
[20:49] is the what are let's say the
[20:50] liquidation uh ratios and levels. Um so
[20:54] I think those are important things to
[20:56] think about. Um I wouldn't necessarily
[20:58] say it's for everybody. You know some
[21:00] people they just have a blanket no debt
[21:02] position. Uh and totally fair enough.
[21:06] You know I I personally I hold zero debt
[21:08] um at least right now. I haven't engaged
[21:11] in some of these. Now I but I'm not
[21:13] opposed to it. I think if you were very
[21:16] very cautious and very judicious about
[21:18] it. I I'm not opposed to people using
[21:21] those things. But I would just say be
[21:23] very conservative in how you do that and
[21:25] be like you should you should you know
[21:27] do up a spreadsheet and calculate out
[21:30] some different levels and some different
[21:31] numbers and okay make sure it's you know
[21:33] below a certain percentage of your stack
[21:36] such that you are not levering up too
[21:39] high too heavily um but I think it can
[21:44] make sense if you are kind of very
[21:46] prudent about it and doing very small
[21:48] levels of leverage um but when I say
[21:52] that I should also caveat. I think there
[21:54] are people who are not good at this kind
[21:56] of thing and they should just totally
[21:57] avoid it because for them they may not
[21:59] be good
[22:00] at being financially prudent about it
[22:03] about these things about making sure
[22:05] things are within safe very low levels
[22:07] as a percent of your overall stack and
[22:10] maybe you're better off you know most
[22:12] people it's kind of like it's like with
[22:14] trading I I believe most probably 99% of
[22:17] people who try trading will lose so you
[22:20] know maybe maybe it's not quite that bad
[22:23] But it's one of those things where it's
[22:25] uh you need to understand what you're
[22:27] doing before you really um do that. And
[22:30] for many people the safe, you know, the
[22:33] safe obvious thing is just, you know,
[22:34] live within your means, stack sats
[22:37] ideally into your own hardware wallet or
[22:39] multisig and just do that for a long
[22:42] period of for a long enough period of
[22:43] time, 5 to 10 years, and then from then
[22:46] on you you generally will be in a pretty
[22:48] good in a good position because by then
[22:50] you've been saving um you know that
[22:53] that'll be
[22:55] qu. Um that's that's how I'm thinking
[22:57] about it. Um, so yeah, short summary.
[23:00] I'm not I'm not totally against it, but
[23:01] I'm just very I would say be very
[23:03] cautious and conservative about it if
[23:05] you engage in that. Yeah. And I also
[23:08] completely stay away from it. Uh, and my
[23:10] main reason is peace of mind. Yeah. And
[23:13] that's totally fair because for some
[23:15] people it is like it weighs on their
[23:17] mind when they've got that debt hanging
[23:19] over them. And so it just feels like ah,
[23:21] you know what, I'd rather get out from
[23:23] underneath that. Um, I understand that
[23:25] could be controversial because for some
[23:26] people they see it as like no it it
[23:28] should be totally zero debt. Um whereas
[23:31] others are seeing it more like no that's
[23:33] actually part of how you use the fiat
[23:35] system to help end the fiat system right
[23:38] you are helping to you know sort of uh
[23:40] create that kind of inflation let's say
[23:42] um and I mean there are others who as an
[23:45] example they will wait for more easy
[23:48] structured products things like kind of
[23:50] the battery finance sort of use case
[23:52] where um you know people are doing
[23:55] things like crossc collateralizing
[23:57] bitcoin with some business loan that
[23:58] they're doing and putting them together
[24:00] into one package. Uh and so we may start
[24:03] to see this kind of thing or like where
[24:05] it's structured in a way where it's not
[24:07] a liquidation. There's not a liquidation
[24:09] per se. It's it's you know uh and that's
[24:11] where maybe you're getting into like if
[24:13] you look at the way the Bitcoin treasury
[24:14] companies are doing it like the
[24:16] strategies of the world. They don't have
[24:18] a quote unquote liquidation price. Um so
[24:22] you know they they are able to get debt
[24:24] on really good terms better than you and
[24:27] I can get as individuals. Uh so you know
[24:30] important to think carefully about those
[24:32] things.
[24:34] This is actually something that I
[24:36] sometimes unfortunately see. They they
[24:38] look at strategy B of micro strategy
[24:40] before um and think oh I just do the
[24:44] same thing with a consumer credit of
[24:46] like 12% interest rates and like no that
[24:49] that's not the same thing what strategy
[24:51] B is doing and your I don't know
[24:54] $20,000 consumer credit. uh but but
[24:58] everyone has own um but the peace of
[25:00] mind is is I think an underrated thing
[25:03] also as you said I think that I just
[25:05] want to highlight that with the with the
[25:06] axel sheet really played those situation
[25:09] what if Bitcoin goes down 60 70 80%. I I
[25:12] don't think it will, but what if like it
[25:15] could happen? There can be something
[25:17] weird happening in a bitcoin scene. All
[25:18] of a sudden, we are 80% down. Um we we
[25:21] have seen it in the last cycle of like
[25:23] 69,000 or something like that to 16,000
[25:27] or some somewhere around those range.
[25:29] That that can happen again. It's it's
[25:31] it's not completely out of out of reach.
[25:34] Uh but it brings an interesting topic up
[25:37] of time preference of Bitcoiners. and
[25:40] you're a long-term Bitcoiner. So, so you
[25:43] probably went on your own personal
[25:44] journey to like, oh, when can I spend
[25:48] Bitcoin? I want to stack more. I don't
[25:50] want to spend my Bitcoin. Um, how do you
[25:53] approach hodddling for the for the long
[25:55] run, but also not missing out on your
[25:57] life uh and dying with a huge stack of
[26:00] Bitcoin?
[26:01] Yeah. So, I think this is one of those
[26:04] this is going to become a more important
[26:05] thing as well. And this is where kind of
[26:07] the leverage and the lending and this
[26:09] kind of aspect of it can come in as well
[26:11] because sometimes people say hey instead
[26:13] of spending down just borrow against a
[26:15] small amount right now again this comes
[26:17] again the same disclaimers all the same
[26:19] things I was saying before um but I
[26:21] guess there's different schools of
[26:22] thought some people think of it as you
[26:24] know have a fiat cash buffer and you
[26:27] might you as I mean there's different
[26:30] schools of thought but let me let me lay
[26:32] a few ideas out and at least this is
[26:34] what I hear some people are doing right.
[26:37] So as an example, there's, you know,
[26:39] some people who just are always living
[26:42] within their income. So they are just
[26:43] not touching their huddle stack, right?
[26:45] They're just always huddling because
[26:46] they have income. They keep it working.
[26:48] Um, that's a totally, you know, a very
[26:51] humble and good way to do it. Another
[26:53] approach, there might be some who are,
[26:55] like I said, lending, but maybe
[26:56] borrowing against a small percent of
[26:58] their stack and just kind of continually
[27:00] increasing that. as long as it's a very
[27:02] small percent of your stack, it can
[27:04] theoretically it can sort of work. Um I
[27:07] I would say there are obviously there
[27:08] are risks to that also that maybe the
[27:10] lending provider doesn't give you a
[27:12] rollover or of course like you said a
[27:13] big draw down like an 80% draw down but
[27:16] I guess what people might do in that
[27:17] case is because they only borrowed a
[27:18] small percent they can load a little bit
[27:20] more Bitcoin collateral to to not get
[27:22] liquidated and sort of ride out the bare
[27:24] cycle that way. Um, another approach is
[27:27] more
[27:28] like during big runs up, people sell
[27:32] some for fiat, right? Because they need
[27:34] some fiat to obviously pay their bills,
[27:36] pay their rent, feed their family,
[27:37] whatever. Um, and so I think that's
[27:42] another approach. And for some people,
[27:43] that might look like, okay, they've been
[27:45] stacking for whatever for a while, and
[27:48] now they take out, you know, three or
[27:50] four years worth of fiat runway. Um and
[27:53] then they just kind of they've got most
[27:55] of their hodddling but they've got like
[27:57] a few years some fiat runway just to
[27:59] like if they are retired let's say
[28:01] they're not working anymore. Um so it's
[28:04] kind of a few of those
[28:07] are yeah those seem to be the main well
[28:10] I guess the other the other kind of kind
[28:13] of uh idea is just selling a percent
[28:18] every year like so if you think about
[28:19] for the people who who do actually do
[28:21] want to retire and so on
[28:23] um you know you might have heard of the
[28:25] fire movement right this kind of
[28:27] financial independence retire early it
[28:28] was really popular a few years ago I
[28:30] think it's maybe not as popular now but
[28:31] there's still you you know, podcasts and
[28:33] people talking about that and they talk
[28:35] about this whole 4% rule. So, it's kind
[28:36] of like you see some people who might
[28:38] just kind of take that idea and
[28:39] transpose that into Bitcoin and say,
[28:41] "Okay, out of their stack, they're
[28:42] willing to spend 4%." Now, other people
[28:44] believe that number should be higher.
[28:45] Like, I think I did an episode with uh
[28:47] Jeff Ross a little while back, I think
[28:49] last year, and he was saying actually,
[28:51] if you're going to spend down, you could
[28:52] probably spend down like 8% of your
[28:54] stack a year. Now, I don't know, maybe
[28:56] that that feels a bit higher to me. Um,
[28:58] I think 4% probably seems a bit more
[29:00] reasonable. Um, but yeah, I I've seen
[29:04] kind of a range of these different
[29:07] approaches
[29:08] um in terms of what people do to uh
[29:13] yeah, I guess if they're trying to
[29:15] retire. I mean, for me, I'm still
[29:17] working. I'm still doing the podcast.
[29:18] Um, so just uh trying to live within my
[29:21] means. Um but yeah, it is it is fair to
[29:24] sort of think about that balance because
[29:27] you can't just sort of put your life on
[29:29] hold forever and m stack to the maximum.
[29:32] So there'll be times where you know life
[29:34] events happen and if you need to spend
[29:36] you know it's okay to spend for some
[29:39] life event or to you know keep your
[29:42] family uh nourished and uh doing okay.
[29:46] So, you know, I think it's funny because
[29:48] online there are these, let's say,
[29:50] stereotypes of like, oh yeah, live under
[29:53] the bridge and memorize your 12word C,
[29:55] don't even have a hardware wallet and
[29:57] you know, and this kind of thing. But
[30:00] actually, when you meet hodddlers in
[30:01] real life, I mean, you talk you meet
[30:03] people at conferences and events. I
[30:04] mean, there are guys who have families
[30:06] and, you know, they're relatively
[30:09] normal. Now, yes, they might be quite
[30:11] obsessed about lowering their expenses
[30:13] so they can stack more SATs. Um but you
[30:16] know you reach uh you you uh you reach a
[30:20] a happy medium ideally you reach some
[30:23] kind of happy balance between snacking
[30:26] for the long term but
[30:28] also having you
[30:31] know having an enriching life for you
[30:34] and for your family. So I think it's,
[30:38] you know, what I've seen people do is
[30:39] probably
[30:40] some option or combination of those
[30:44] things. Um, for some people, yeah, so I
[30:46] guess summarizing, some people borrow
[30:48] against their coins. Some people just
[30:49] straight spend down and maybe other
[30:51] people they sort of wait for uh a bull
[30:55] run and take out some take some, you
[30:57] know, fiat uh chips off the table, per
[30:59] se, uh, in those times to sort of ride
[31:03] through the next bare cycle. Let's take
[31:05] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[31:07] beauty that coin vigilante has made with
[31:10] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[31:13] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[31:16] of showing that you are a true
[31:19] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[31:21] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:24] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:26] collections. You have the date of the
[31:29] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[31:32] and of course also the block height and
[31:35] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[31:38] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:41] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[31:43] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:46] down in the descriptions. I love those
[31:48] watches so so much. And now if you have
[31:52] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[31:54] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[31:56] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[31:58] to deal with that. The first way is you
[32:01] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[32:03] entry for you to get into the
[32:06] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[32:09] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[32:11] super simple and secure way. And if you
[32:14] check out the link in the description,
[32:16] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[32:19] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[32:22] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[32:25] partner in terms of how to get the most
[32:28] out of your sovereignty. They will
[32:31] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[32:34] that is perfect for your individual
[32:37] situation. They will show you how you
[32:39] can secure your own devices. Securing
[32:42] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[32:44] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:46] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:49] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:51] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:54] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:57] place already? And last but not least,
[32:59] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[33:01] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[33:03] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[33:08] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[33:11] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[33:14] be for the first time ever speaking at
[33:16] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:19] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:22] really looking forward to seeing all of
[33:24] you there. You can get your ticket in
[33:26] the link down in the description of
[33:29] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[33:31] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[33:35] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:36] there. that is the the the different
[33:38] strategies is is really fun to talk
[33:40] about uh especially with those people
[33:43] who are close uh or at 100% of of
[33:46] Bitcoin allocation uh uh like myself
[33:49] actually uh of like how how do you
[33:51] balance that because maybe you live
[33:54] within your means but there's like one
[33:56] month where you have to spend a little
[33:58] bit over and then the next month is is
[34:00] is way more frugal. Uh so like okay do
[34:03] you then take a little bit out or do you
[34:06] go short-term in depth uh in in feiat
[34:09] like there's usually on on accounts uh
[34:11] at least in Austria I have like an
[34:13] $10,000 overdraft that I can always use
[34:17] uh and and pay back whenever I want. Uh
[34:19] so so there are like a lot of fiat small
[34:22] tools that you can use that are not uh
[34:24] that that uh complicated. Uh, so it's
[34:27] super interesting how people approach it
[34:30] and I just recently and I'm really
[34:31] curious how how you think about that and
[34:33] and you do it also with your podcast. I
[34:36] now pay people in Bitcoin since
[34:38] literally uh last month I started that.
[34:40] Uh, and it hurts me way more than the
[34:45] same amount when it goes from my fiat
[34:46] bank account. I I know it does not make
[34:48] logic sense because it's the same amount
[34:50] because if I spend in a bitcoin I could
[34:52] also just say if if I spend fear I could
[34:56] also have bought bitcoin with that same
[34:58] amount and then it does not make
[35:00] mathematical sense but there's some
[35:03] barrier that I don't want to spend my
[35:06] bitcoin and I actually overcame that
[35:08] with having two different setups of like
[35:12] one cold cold storage and one hot cold
[35:16] storage where it is um self-custody, it
[35:19] is cold, but I can spend from there.
[35:22] It's like okay, if it's there, it's it's
[35:24] okay if I spend all of it and once I
[35:26] have enough in there, I move it to my
[35:28] cold cold storage where it's not not
[35:30] going away. Yeah. I mean, I think the
[35:32] way I think I I agree the way I would
[35:35] the way I think about it, it's probably
[35:36] similar there. I have let's say you
[35:38] might have a hot wallet on your phone
[35:40] that's like your lightning wallet or
[35:41] whatever. And then you might have a
[35:43] warm, let's say a single signature as an
[35:46] example that's kind of like a little
[35:48] like you think of it as a somewhat warm
[35:51] uh where you've got mediumsiz amounts
[35:53] and then for large amounts multi-ig cold
[35:56] storage multiple devices multiple
[35:58] locations kind of the more deep security
[36:02] uh that you might not touch so often.
[36:04] whereas like your hot and your warm
[36:06] setup that you're touching those more
[36:08] often and you're spending and earning
[36:09] into into or out of those. Um, so you
[36:13] know, I think you just get used to it
[36:14] over time, but the point is just like if
[36:16] you're truly a believer in Bitcoin, then
[36:19] you are thinking about your net worth in
[36:22] Bitcoin terms and you're trying to
[36:23] increase that number over time. So I
[36:26] think that's kind of effectively where
[36:28] it's at. And then people have to decide
[36:31] what are they going to do in terms of
[36:33] living expenses, right? Are they going
[36:34] to um just live within their means or
[36:37] actually do one of those other options.
[36:39] Um so, you know, it's it's I think
[36:43] there'll be seasons and times in your
[36:44] life where you where you need to spend
[36:46] down. You know, if you're you're getting
[36:47] married or having a child or these kinds
[36:49] of things, I mean, there'll be expenses
[36:50] and um you might you might need to spend
[36:53] some down at that point, but then
[36:55] hopefully you're earning back at some
[36:57] other point. and you know so I think as
[37:00] long as you are you know being careful
[37:03] about that and sort of thinking about
[37:04] your budgeting and all those things I
[37:06] think it kind of all works out in the
[37:08] end um so long as yeah you you you have
[37:12] some broad budget ideas that you are
[37:14] loosely staying within those it's I
[37:17] think it's okay uh when I look at all in
[37:19] Bitcoin uh just as the last question on
[37:21] that topic um there's this reaction from
[37:24] people outside of Bitcoin like oh how
[37:26] can you
[37:27] all in in Bitcoin. Even like if you're
[37:29] 50%, it's it seems irresponsible. Uh
[37:32] within Bitcoin, uh that idea is like,
[37:35] oh, of course you're all in. Like, what
[37:36] else would you buy? Like there's no
[37:38] other asset uh to even uh um uh put out
[37:42] put your money in. Maybe owning your own
[37:44] home is an and popular idea also in in
[37:47] in Bitcoin, not like as an investment,
[37:48] but just like having building a family
[37:51] there and and stuff like that. Maybe
[37:53] having your own business also uh is
[37:55] something acceptable. How do you look if
[37:58] being all in Bitcoin actually makes
[38:01] sense and is financially responsible?
[38:04] So, it makes more sense especially if
[38:06] you are younger, right? I think the way
[38:08] people normally think about this is like
[38:10] if you are younger versus older, that's
[38:12] where, you know, if you're younger, you
[38:14] have more time to make it up. If you're
[38:16] younger, you and you're still working,
[38:18] you can afford to be to to be more
[38:21] aggressive about it. uh and so I think
[38:24] the other aspect of it also just is if
[38:26] you are new like if you if it's your
[38:29] first cycle then uh you have to be more
[38:33] cautious about it but I think over time
[38:36] you know as you uh have been through a
[38:38] few cycles and now you're sort of at a
[38:40] level that you're comfortable with then
[38:44] I think you can because I think for
[38:49] those of us who are in Bitcoin and
[38:50] really really into it we see Bitcoin is
[38:52] the safe thing to hold and other things
[38:54] are the nonsafe thing to hold. So that's
[38:57] kind of how most I guess most kind of
[38:59] hardcore longtime Bitcoiners are seeing
[39:01] it. But you know I think it's there'll
[39:04] be people who decide hey you need uh
[39:06] some other if you have some business
[39:09] some some of your net worth is in this
[39:11] business or in this um house you know so
[39:15] be it. I I think um you just have to
[39:17] make that call. But you have to be very
[39:19] judicious again like before you let's
[39:22] say if it comes to a decision where
[39:23] you're having to let go of some Bitcoin
[39:24] because you want to you know you need
[39:26] that house or whatever you just have to
[39:28] be really sure that this is what you
[39:29] want and that you will be comfortable
[39:32] with that because you know in 10 years
[39:34] time 20 years time you for you that
[39:37] could be your personal 10,000 bitcoins
[39:38] for two pizzas story. you could be like,
[39:40] "Oh, damn. That house cost, you know, 50
[39:43] Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin or whatever." So,
[39:45] you just need to make sure that is a
[39:47] small enough fraction of your stack that
[39:50] you're okay with that. Um, but we all
[39:53] have to live. And so, you know, and even
[39:57] more than just living, it's like you can
[39:59] live a life of just like, you know,
[40:02] living in a proverbial cardboard box or
[40:05] you can, you know, live a, you know, a
[40:07] reasonable uh living standard. Uh, and
[40:12] you know, I think there's also a time
[40:14] and a place to do certain things that,
[40:16] you know, maybe you can only do certain
[40:17] things when you're young and physically
[40:19] able and when you're older, you know,
[40:21] maybe it's a different activity or it's
[40:23] just not the same thing that you can do
[40:24] and you slow and people slow down over
[40:26] time as they age anyway. So, you also
[40:28] have to think about that aspect like the
[40:30] arc of your life that let's say a
[40:32] typical life expectancy is 80 years
[40:35] something like that.
[40:37] So remember that past let's say 70 years
[40:41] old it gets harder to do things. So you
[40:44] really have until like that time uh to
[40:48] actually go and
[40:50] uh undertake some of these different um
[40:53] activities or things you want to do
[40:54] whether it's traveling or maybe you want
[40:56] to do a business or some other thing. So
[40:58] you know you you really have to just
[41:00] balance all of these factors. So there's
[41:02] no oneizefits-all answer unfortunately.
[41:05] Absolutely. And Bitcoiners still have
[41:07] have chairs in their homes. I've seen
[41:09] it. Yeah.
[41:11] Um uh was the volatility for you
[41:15] actually hard in in the beginning? I I
[41:16] imagine now you're emotionally
[41:18] emotionally detached from from the
[41:20] price, but was it hard for you in the
[41:22] beginning? Yeah, for sure. I think it
[41:24] just kind of I think it just it was
[41:27] extremely volatile um in earlier years.
[41:30] I think volatility has come down a lot
[41:32] actually. Um, so it's not as crazy
[41:34] nowadays. Uh, but yeah, there were days
[41:37] when, you know, it it felt like it would
[41:38] just rocket up and down 50%, 30%. Like,
[41:42] and and of course, as you know, at the
[41:44] kind of the end of the cycle, you get
[41:45] this big 80% draw down. And, you know,
[41:48] you're dealing with that. And so, yeah,
[41:51] but I think at the end, you sort of have
[41:54] to just really focus back and think,
[41:56] well, what do I hold? Why am I holding
[41:58] it? Why do I believe this is going to
[41:59] win? And when you really think it out
[42:02] and think, okay, yeah, Bitcoin is a
[42:04] superior money, it's just going through
[42:07] this volatile early phase. And even now
[42:10] in 2025, it's still early, broadly
[42:13] speaking. Like we've probably still got
[42:15] another two decades or so before we get
[42:18] like to really um big mainstream uh
[42:21] acceptance and awareness and adoption.
[42:23] So I'd say we have awareness now, but
[42:25] how many of those people are actually
[42:26] holding Bitcoin? And even the ones who
[42:28] do hold Bitcoin, what percent of their
[42:30] net worth are they putting in? Um, and
[42:32] then even there when we talk about
[42:33] nation states, yeah, there's been talk
[42:35] about it, but how many are realistically
[42:37] really trying hard to stack, right?
[42:39] Other than Bhutan, um, and El Salvador,
[42:43] uh, who's like really actually trying to
[42:46] stack, it's not that that many. Okay.
[42:48] Yeah. I think um the UAE was sort of and
[42:53] uh it sort of came out that one of the
[42:54] sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi was
[42:56] buying I think one of the uh Bitcoin
[42:58] ETFs and I believe um in the UAE there
[43:03] are I think some of the one or some of
[43:06] the sovereign wealth funds have like
[43:08] investment in Bitcoin mining as well or
[43:10] partnership with like Marathon as an
[43:12] example. So, you know, uh I know I think
[43:15] similar in Ethiopia um for partnership
[43:18] with Marathon, things like that. But
[43:20] anyway, the point is there's not that
[43:21] many nation states who are truly truly
[43:23] going hard stacking Bitcoin, right? It's
[43:26] early days. Even though they're talking
[43:27] about it, Trump has mentioned that he
[43:29] wants USA to be the Bitcoin and crypto
[43:31] superpower of the world, but it's it it
[43:36] all just takes time. And I think it just
[43:37] comes back
[43:39] to it. It it'll take longer than what
[43:42] you think when you're new. It's super
[43:44] interesting what uh to to see uh Donald
[43:48] Trump coming into Bitcoin and his his
[43:51] his development in there. How do how did
[43:53] you look at that when you saw him first
[43:54] on the Bitcoin conference and now like
[43:56] uh with uh with that crypto dinner that
[43:59] they had with SA and all those things
[44:01] that came out? Yeah. So, it's
[44:03] interesting because if you went back
[44:04] just a few years ago, like 2019 or so, I
[44:07] think there was like a a video or a
[44:09] quote of him being like, "No, the dollar
[44:11] supremacy can't be challenged, you know,
[44:13] and now it's almost it's gone full 180.
[44:15] Now it's all pro crypto like." And of
[44:18] course, there are some downsides to this
[44:20] also because there are shitcoins and
[44:22] meme coins and things like this that you
[44:24] know, it just seems to be you know,
[44:26] crime is legal now apparently. So, uh,
[44:29] you know, people are just launching all
[44:30] kinds of [ __ ] coins and meme coins and
[44:33] whatever. Um, and it seems to just be
[44:36] quote unquote it's pro crypto. It's
[44:38] permissive. And so it's very much a
[44:40] buyer beware situation because you know
[44:43] maybe you and I aren't going to like get
[44:45] caught up in some memecoin shitcoin but
[44:47] maybe your friends or family or maybe
[44:49] one layer out like your friend of a
[44:51] friend they could get caught up in that
[44:53] stuff if they're not careful or they
[44:55] don't understand how this world works of
[44:58] you know this kind of insider dumping on
[45:00] outsiders dynamic. Um, but you know, I
[45:04] think the good side of it is though,
[45:06] yes, there are some of these meme coins
[45:08] and shitins or whatever, but to me it
[45:09] comes back to what is the story for this
[45:11] cycle. It's Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin
[45:14] treasury companies. I think, you know,
[45:16] whether we like it or not, that seems to
[45:17] be where the interest and the money
[45:19] flows are. Substantial money flows are
[45:22] coming in in via those means. So uh it's
[45:26] just a matter of understanding where
[45:29] things are and making sure that we are
[45:31] advocating for the things that we
[45:33] believe uh to ideally uh help Bitcoin
[45:37] grow and ideally make it so that less
[45:41] people get wrecked in the next FTX or
[45:43] the next whatever. Absolutely. Uh when I
[45:46] orange people and I tell them about
[45:48] Bitcoin, usually one of the first
[45:49] questions like oh like where can I buy
[45:50] it? I always only recommend bitcoin only
[45:53] services because I've seen it so many
[45:55] times where I recommend them something
[45:57] especially in the early days where I was
[45:58] still um a little bit more on the soft
[46:01] side for alcoins and some of course you
[46:04] can also buy it there and then they come
[46:06] back of like yeah I bought some bitcoin
[46:08] but also like those 20 other tokens and
[46:10] if they just don't have the
[46:11] possibilities with a bitcoin only
[46:12] exchange or bitcoin only services uh
[46:15] it's it's it makes all the differences.
[46:19] Yeah, but I think that to me comes back
[46:20] to there's a desire because let's break
[46:23] it down this way. There are people who
[46:24] just want to save and for that obviously
[46:26] just buying bitcoin storing in your
[46:28] hardware wallet your multi very easy
[46:29] fine but there are those people who want
[46:33] greater than bitcoin returns and for
[46:36] that historically people went to
[46:39] shitcoins right they went to altcoins
[46:40] because historically in their that was
[46:42] kind of that was the narrative and in
[46:44] truth that was that would happen like
[46:46] that like shitcoins would pump harder
[46:48] than bitcoin but they would also dump
[46:49] harder than bitcoin in cycles gone by
[46:51] but now it may it may be more like
[46:54] people go to these Bitcoin treasury
[46:55] companies if they want the hot source or
[46:58] they want the more than Bitcoin return
[47:00] with risk and paying for it. Uh but that
[47:04] may be that that may change even this
[47:07] cycle, right? That maybe people have
[47:09] Bitcoin um you know they may have some
[47:11] in their ETF, they may have some in
[47:13] their hardware wallet or multisig and
[47:14] then they might have a small percent
[47:16] with Bitcoin treasury companies because
[47:18] they're looking for yield. This kind of
[47:19] thing. Um I think even in the 21 cycle
[47:22] we saw the miners acted as a bit of that
[47:25] also that people wanted mining as a kind
[47:27] of leverage play on Bitcoin and now it
[47:30] seems like the financial system is sort
[47:33] of set up in a way the current fiat
[47:35] fractional reserve system is set up in
[47:37] this way where these treasury companies
[47:40] can get uh really cheap access to equity
[47:43] and debt and then for that reason they
[47:45] can lever up in a way that you and I as
[47:48] individuals can't do and So then I see
[47:51] that as you know there'll be people who
[47:53] are going for these kinds of uh products
[47:55] whether that's you know MSDR and these
[47:58] other products uh like the income sort
[48:00] of focused um products uh from uh these
[48:05] uh treasury companies. So I think that
[48:08] may be one area that's a little
[48:10] different this cycle right compared to
[48:11] past uh cycles.
[48:14] I I I started saying that I think like
[48:16] half a half half a year or so ago that I
[48:20] think uh that micro strategy and
[48:23] treasury companies and now strategy B um
[48:27] are the new altcoin season uh because I
[48:30] always hear in the comments of like oh I
[48:31] just buy altcoins to outperform Bitcoin
[48:33] and I'm like I'm not so sure this will
[48:35] be the case now also uh because I see
[48:39] now a lot of people that just want to go
[48:42] just want to have Namuk up technology.
[48:44] Uh they actually say like, "Oh, like
[48:46] let's let's buy some strategy B. I can
[48:48] do it in my broker. I don't even have to
[48:50] go on a crypto exchange." Um I think I
[48:53] think they they kind of stole the fun of
[48:54] the altcoins.
[48:56] Yeah. And I you know what,
[48:58] arguably, as Bitcoiners, we would rather
[49:01] they buy a Bitcoin treasury company than
[49:02] buy an altcoin. So, you know, yes, it's
[49:06] not the purest answer. Of course, the
[49:07] purest answer is yes. Not your keys, not
[49:09] your coins. Get your own coins into your
[49:11] own hardware wallet, etc. Um, but for a
[49:14] lot of people it's understanding where
[49:16] they are in the cycle, where they are in
[49:17] their own personal journey. And to be
[49:20] fair, even for some old, more
[49:22] experienced Bitcoiners, they may decide
[49:24] with a small percent, let's say 5% or
[49:26] 10%, something like this, they may
[49:28] decide that they want a bit of treasury
[49:30] company exposure anyway because they
[49:31] want a little bit of leverage, but
[49:33] without getting liquidated and this kind
[49:34] of thing and having to execute it
[49:36] themselves, they would rather just buy,
[49:38] you know, these companies or the, you
[49:41] know, the the various forms to get that
[49:43] leverage exposure because they're really
[49:45] they want more Bitcoin.
[49:47] Absolutely. Um you said something uh
[49:50] before I think it was something like two
[49:52] cycles uh that you've seen till we come
[49:55] really to mainstream adoption. Um what
[49:57] do you think is is holding people back?
[50:00] Is it like educ education time? Do we
[50:02] need more infrastructure? As the saying
[50:04] goes, science often progresses one
[50:06] funeral at a time. And so sometimes it
[50:10] it just you know there are people who
[50:12] are just holding on to older ideas and
[50:16] they end up as they age they pass on and
[50:20] they pass that wealth down to different
[50:21] generations. And so for example think
[50:23] about the boomer generation today. The
[50:26] boomer generation arguably holds a lot
[50:27] of the wealth, more so than our
[50:30] generation. Um, more so than the Gen Z
[50:33] below us, or I don't know, maybe I don't
[50:35] know how old you are, but I I'm right on
[50:38] the border, but I'm still a Gen Z. So,
[50:40] I'm I'm I think I'm 1998 and I think
[50:43] with 1997 is the the the cut off. Okay.
[50:45] So, you're like one of the older Gen
[50:47] Z's, right? So, yeah. So, I
[50:51] think I think that's just going to
[50:53] naturally drive a change, right? A lot
[50:54] of boomers, they might hold gold, they
[50:56] might hold property and stocks and
[50:57] things like this. Whereas once that
[50:59] wealth passes down to, let's say, their
[51:02] millennial children and maybe some Gen
[51:05] Z's
[51:07] um they're going to be more inclined to
[51:09] hold some Bitcoin. And even those people
[51:11] who hold some Bitcoin, they don't
[51:12] necessarily go all in. They it takes
[51:14] time. So yes, there are the people who
[51:16] just kind of learn about Bitcoin and
[51:18] they go all in and they go really soon
[51:20] in like in the space of six months to a
[51:23] year that like they've they've gone down
[51:25] that orange pill journey and they're all
[51:27] in. But not everyone's going to be like
[51:29] that, right? So there'll be people who
[51:30] maybe they took a you know 1% or 5%
[51:33] allocation or 10% maybe and then they
[51:36] stay there and okay that cycle plays out
[51:39] uh and then they slowly increase that
[51:42] way. So, you know, I just think it's
[51:43] it's it can only grow so quickly. And I
[51:46] think that's probably the big one big
[51:49] thing that I've changed my mind on,
[51:51] which was, you know, when I was new and
[51:54] thought, oh, wow, this thing is going to
[51:56] happen so quickly. It's going to be a
[51:57] few years and then the whole world is
[51:59] No, I think it just there's only so fast
[52:02] it can grow. there's only so quickly
[52:05] that we can, let's say, suck uh the
[52:08] monetary premium out of other assets and
[52:10] bring it over it to us into our world
[52:12] into Bitcoin. Uh and that that we just
[52:15] have to be humble and accept that
[52:18] there's only so fast that it can happen.
[52:19] Now, of course, I mean, if it happens
[52:22] faster, great. I I'm all for it. But I'm
[52:25] just trying to be realistic because I
[52:27] think people get their expectations set
[52:30] wrong and then they are disappointed,
[52:33] right? So even in the 21 cycle, every
[52:35] man and his dog thought we were going
[52:37] well over 100K. I thought we were going
[52:39] over 100K, but we didn't. We stopped,
[52:41] you know, we topped at like 69K or
[52:43] whatever and that was it. And so I think
[52:46] people are going to do the same thing.
[52:48] And to some extent, you know, we live in
[52:49] the social media attention economy, so
[52:52] the kind of engagement of like, oh, 1
[52:55] million this year or 1 million this
[52:56] cycle and this kind of thing. But no, I
[52:59] just think that's extremely unlikely. I
[53:01] I think the more likely is sort of
[53:04] diminishing returns, diminishing
[53:05] volatility. And that is what we've seen.
[53:07] That's objectively, statistically, that
[53:08] is what we have seen over the last,
[53:10] let's say, 15, 16 years that Bitcoin has
[53:12] had a price. It has been diminishing
[53:14] returns, diminishing volatility over
[53:16] that time. So, we should expect that
[53:18] going forward as opposed to the people
[53:20] who are sort of wishing that to me
[53:23] that's wishful thinking that all of a
[53:24] sudden we're just going to have this
[53:26] scurve moment. We're just going to have
[53:28] a suddenly moment. I just don't think
[53:30] it's that likely. Um while of course I
[53:33] would love it if it did, it's just not
[53:34] that likely. It's an interesting point
[53:37] of because like Bitcoin for me has two
[53:41] factors of growth when we look at the
[53:43] price. the the one factor is just
[53:45] adoption, more people coming in and the
[53:47] second factor is like the fiat is
[53:49] getting worse. It's devalued. Of course,
[53:52] if if the fiat is devalued, Bitcoin is
[53:54] also rising. And in many ways, I
[53:56] actually
[53:58] uh think it could be good for Bitcoin,
[54:01] but maybe bad for overall the world if
[54:04] Bitcoin is adopted too quickly. This
[54:06] means this this probably also means that
[54:09] the fiat system is is going down. uh in
[54:13] a very very quick fashion. And I always
[54:16] bring the example of the Titanic up. Um
[54:19] if the Titanic is sinking and most
[54:21] people are still on there and there's
[54:22] like a small uh lifeboat with with
[54:24] Bitcoin and we we have to get people on
[54:27] there. We don't want the Titanic to sink
[54:30] too quickly. We want to build like
[54:32] gradually uh out the infrastructure, the
[54:35] layer tools, the the services, the
[54:37] financial in institutions around that.
[54:40] Um to to be able to have like now we
[54:43] have what may maybe 200, 300, maybe 500
[54:47] million people on Bitcoin. I've seen so
[54:49] many different statistics. Um but there
[54:51] are like 8 billion people on the planet.
[54:54] And even of the 5 even if you go on the
[54:57] mass with like 500 million people, how
[54:59] many people actually use Bitcoin uh the
[55:02] main chain and and the layer twos and
[55:04] stuff like that? So um maybe there's
[55:07] like even an incentive to let that fear
[55:10] system ride out over a longer period of
[55:12] time versus going next week to 10
[55:15] million. Well, I think whether whether
[55:19] we want it or not, I think it's just it
[55:20] can only grow so quickly, right? because
[55:22] it's sort of like we've reached a
[55:23] certain level of scale and size that
[55:26] it's just difficult to quickly grow.
[55:29] Like you you need to find massive buyers
[55:32] to really
[55:33] commit and it's not that easy to find
[55:36] them. Um of course, you know, maybe a
[55:39] large nation state if they were if if a
[55:41] bunch of nation states were to start
[55:43] printing fiat to buy Bitcoin, then okay,
[55:45] yeah, maybe. But it's just unlikely at
[55:47] this point. I
[55:49] think you know governments have uh the
[55:53] well countries around the world there's
[55:55] a lot of these social or cultural
[55:56] problems that they're dealing with
[55:57] economic problems that they're dealing
[55:59] with. It's unlikely that they're going
[56:01] to sort of care as much about you know
[56:04] the pet issue that you and I have which
[56:06] is hey Bitcoin is the is the answer. Now
[56:09] of course I think it is the answer. I
[56:10] think it would be one of the the biggest
[56:13] levers to change things at a social and
[56:15] cultural level. I think we uh a lot of
[56:19] people don't understand that aspect of
[56:21] how Bitcoin can fix cultural things and
[56:23] social things in our world, but from
[56:26] their perspective, they see it like
[56:28] they've got all these other issues to
[56:29] deal with, whether that's, you know,
[56:31] wars going on around the world or these
[56:33] different things. So, you know, there's
[56:35] only so fast Bitcoin can grow. And I
[56:37] think that's that's just kind of the the
[56:40] realistic expectation that I'm uh trying
[56:44] to hold. Um, and also here's the other
[56:46] thing. Um, my friend Safetine Namoose
[56:50] talks about this idea that as more and
[56:53] more people go to Bitcoin, it sort of
[56:56] stops some of the inflation aspects, the
[56:59] the more inflationary aspects of it, as
[57:01] more and more people start to actually
[57:04] use Bitcoin. Um, but I mean, at the same
[57:06] time, you you could say, look, well,
[57:08] look at these treasury companies.
[57:10] They're using leverage. some of them or
[57:12] all of them or at least the ones that
[57:14] are doing financial quote unquote
[57:15] financial engineering. The ones who are
[57:16] merely holding Bitcoin, okay, maybe not,
[57:19] but we're we're gonna we are arguably
[57:21] going to see more and more companies
[57:23] start to do that. Just recently, as you
[57:25] as I'm sure you know, the GameStop um
[57:28] news h came out that they were looking
[57:31] to do this kind of strategy as well,
[57:34] this kind of financial engineering um to
[57:37] acquire Bitcoin. So um for now it's it's
[57:41] more in the camp of you know just a few
[57:43] years ago it used to be oh it's only
[57:44] small countries you know only El
[57:46] Salvador that was kind of the narrative
[57:47] and now of course the US government has
[57:49] come out saying we're going to be the
[57:50] the pro you know the premier crypto
[57:53] bitcoin nation and I think the similar
[57:55] thing now is with some of the
[57:56] corporations it's sort of only the
[57:58] corporations that are seen as oh that's
[58:00] zombie those are zombie corporations
[58:02] those aren't kind of really truly
[58:04] profitable corporations who are jumping
[58:06] on the Bitcoin bandwagon. It's just
[58:09] people who are I mean that's the
[58:10] narrative, right? I'm not saying I
[58:11] agree. I think it'll maybe right now
[58:13] that's sort of where it's at. But
[58:15] eventually in the eyes of the normie
[58:17] it'll be seen as no, you need to hold
[58:19] Bitcoin if you're a serious business, a
[58:21] serious entrepreneur, serious investor.
[58:24] You need to be holding Bitcoin. You need
[58:25] to be doing something with Bitcoin. Um
[58:28] or you are just, you know, it's like
[58:30] you're in the boxing ring with one arm
[58:32] tied behind your back. You're just
[58:33] you're leaving yourself at a massive
[58:34] disadvantage if you don't do this. So
[58:37] you know over time it will evolve that
[58:39] that narrative shift will occur. Um we
[58:42] are still some time away from that
[58:44] though from like it being let's say
[58:46] commonly understood that every business
[58:48] should do that.
[58:50] Yeah. And and the company stories is is
[58:52] is also quite fascinating because when
[58:55] like Micro Strategy was the first
[58:57] publicly traded company that did it um
[59:00] in 2020 and now we have 80 uh so of
[59:04] course it's it's it's it's like 80
[59:06] companies. It's It's not bad, but it's
[59:08] not like
[59:10] 2,000 and and we have in in the S&P 500
[59:14] still just one with Tesla and they hold
[59:17] only a small portion of of of their the
[59:20] B of their what they could hold in
[59:23] Bitcoin. I think they have around 9,000
[59:24] or 10,000 Bitcoin. But yeah, you're
[59:27] totally right. this th those things take
[59:30] longer and especially with companies
[59:32] because there's not only one individual,
[59:34] there are several individuals that that
[59:36] make a decision together and that
[59:38] network effect uh and oh that's maybe
[59:41] that's also an interesting one. uh the
[59:43] career risk uh do do you think uh that
[59:45] career risk will then also flip within
[59:47] the next like two cycles with with maybe
[59:50] now there's a career risk where a CFO
[59:53] says oh if I'm pushing Bitcoin now uh
[59:56] what if we have now a downward cycle and
[59:59] and even if I'm a Bitcoiner like I'm
[60:01] scared to lose my job um and when will
[60:04] this career risk flip to the other side
[60:06] where if you're a CFO and you don't have
[60:08] a Bitcoin strategy you might be replaced
[60:12] It's bad for you. Yeah. Um, good
[60:15] question. Hard to say. Um, I think over
[60:19] the next year or so, I think we'll stay
[60:21] we'll see at least a few more um big
[60:23] ones come over. Um, I think an
[60:26] interesting one is Facebook or Meta
[60:28] because Mark Zuckerberg has a goat named
[60:31] Bitcoin. And I'm, you know, like you
[60:33] hear rumors that basically all these
[60:34] tech CEOs, they all have Bitcoin
[60:37] personally. You kind of these are the
[60:39] rumors you hear. I don't know for sure,
[60:40] but it would make sense, right? These
[60:42] are tech guys, they would they would
[60:44] have looked at it at some point and
[60:45] thought, "All right, let me maybe they
[60:46] tell their guy, hey, just get me a
[60:48] little bit just to, you know, not have
[60:49] zero." Um, but maybe they've decided,
[60:52] "Hey, it's not right for the company."
[60:53] Right? Or I'll give you the example of
[60:54] Microsoft, right? Um, even after Sailor
[60:57] pitched them, what did they vote? It was
[60:58] like
[60:59] 0.55%. Right? So it just shows you how
[61:02] early we are in terms of like the boomer
[61:04] normie mind that it's not there yet in
[61:07] terms of because as you said the sea
[61:10] level of that company the seauite the
[61:12] CEO and the CFO and all these people
[61:14] even if you had them on board and even
[61:16] if you had the board on
[61:17] board the the shareholders may not be on
[61:20] board and that was the case with
[61:21] Microsoft right 0.55% is very very low
[61:24] it's not enough to really drive a change
[61:27] um it'll ch it'll it'll come eventually
[61:30] um But it might be another one or two
[61:32] cycles away, you know, like here we are
[61:33] in
[61:34] 2025. I don't know. Like I I could see
[61:37] it probably in the 2030s. In the early
[61:40] 2030s is probably when we start to see
[61:43] like serious like it would be crazy for
[61:47] you to not have at least some Bitcoin.
[61:50] You know, I think that's probably around
[61:53] when it starts to happen. Um just you
[61:56] know of course I wish it happened now
[61:58] but I think
[61:59] realistically end of this decade or
[62:01] early next decade is more realistic
[62:04] there. Interesting. Uh one last thing on
[62:07] the on the cycles. Um how do you look at
[62:11] um the crossover to fiat with like
[62:15] stable coins on Bitcoin, stable coins on
[62:17] on other cryptos, DeFi applications? Do
[62:20] you see that maybe as as as the bridge
[62:22] that slowly gets adopted from from fiat
[62:26] to to Bitcoin? Yeah, for some people and
[62:29] I guess for even in even on stable
[62:31] coins, there are people who have kind of
[62:33] there's a range of gamut there's a gamut
[62:35] of views even in the Bitcoin world,
[62:36] right? Because there are some who are
[62:37] like totally against them. Uh who are
[62:40] like see that as that's that is the new
[62:42] CBDC or look at the surveillance machine
[62:44] that's being created. I'm more in the I
[62:49] think let me put it this way if you have
[62:52] a fiat bank account with a fiat bank
[62:55] card or a fiat debit or credit card I
[62:57] think you are already under a similar
[62:59] level of surveillance whether we like it
[63:00] or not right I don't now I've been
[63:02] against fatf and AML for years I think
[63:05] it should be abolished uh but I think
[63:08] it's unlikely to happen anytime soon
[63:10] because we need to sort of get an
[63:11] Overton window shift to get it there so
[63:14] I see them as look I think people will
[63:17] use stable coins. I think it's probably
[63:20] I mean I I think Tether put out a number
[63:22] I think they said they have 400 million
[63:24] users worldwide whereas Bitcoin users
[63:27] worldwide maybe it's like a 100 million
[63:29] and if we're talking like onchain
[63:31] Bitcoin users that might be more like
[63:33] you know 15 or 20 million in terms of
[63:35] like onchain Bitcoin users. So yeah, I
[63:38] think there are a lot of people who will
[63:39] use stable coins who have not yet come
[63:41] to Bitcoin and stable coins might be a
[63:43] way that they do that. Um I see it like
[63:46] it to me it would feel inconsistent of
[63:49] me to say ah it's okay for me to have US
[63:51] dollar access. I'm an Australian citizen
[63:53] and I can access you know USD foreign
[63:56] exchange accounts and things like this
[63:58] but not for you. It seems a bit you know
[64:01] off to me. Um, so that's why for me it's
[64:03] sort of like I understand why people,
[64:05] you know, like the idea of having a
[64:07] stable coin. Yes, they are surveiled.
[64:09] Yes, they're not decentralized. Um, but
[64:12] will people want them? Yeah, I think
[64:15] there will be a lot of people who want
[64:16] them. And I hope that we can convert as
[64:20] many of those people into real
[64:22] Bitcoiners as we can. But, you know, I I
[64:24] think the people who see it as like, you
[64:28] know, you should uh criticize the stable
[64:30] coins and get people to only use
[64:33] Bitcoin. To me, it's just it's just not
[64:36] recognizing where a lot of these people
[64:38] are at in their lives that maybe they
[64:40] can't afford to or they are not willing
[64:41] to just jump straight to Bitcoin. Of
[64:44] again, I wish more people would just
[64:45] come straight straight to using Bitcoin,
[64:48] but this seems to be, you know, there's
[64:50] a product market fit there that it's
[64:52] hard for us to deny.
[64:54] Um, so yeah, for me it's more like I
[64:59] have used them before, but more in the
[65:01] case of like let's say I'm going to a
[65:03] conference or I'm getting someone wants
[65:05] to pay me and they they can't do it in
[65:07] Bitcoin. Um, you know, as an example, if
[65:10] I'm going to a conference and they're
[65:11] asking me to come and they're offering
[65:13] to pay like a flight in a hotel or just
[65:15] a hotel accommodation, something like
[65:17] that, and they're not willing to pay me
[65:20] in Bitcoin, but they would pay me in
[65:21] stable coin. Well, okay, I'll just take
[65:23] it in stable coin and instantly flip it
[65:25] into Bitcoin, something like that.
[65:27] That's where I've used it personally.
[65:29] But, uh, I I do see them as much better
[65:33] user experience than doing a fiat wire.
[65:35] So, you know, because if you compare,
[65:37] like to me, it's more just it's just a
[65:39] crypto form of dollars. And think about
[65:41] whenever you do a fiat international
[65:43] wire, all the details you have to type
[65:45] in. You got to type in the name, the
[65:47] address, swift code or iband code. Uh
[65:50] you might have to type in the purpose of
[65:52] the transaction. You might need to have
[65:53] a description in the box like that. And
[65:55] then if any one of those details is
[65:56] wrong, uh it gets sent back and then you
[65:59] have to do it all again. It's a pain.
[66:01] So, I can see stable coins being a
[66:04] simpler user experience than that. Um,
[66:07] now will that help the US dollar
[66:10] dominance? Yeah, probably. It's not
[66:12] that, you know, uh, yeah, I think it
[66:15] probably will. I think stable coins will
[66:16] help the US dollar in a sense uh, attack
[66:20] a lot of the weaker fiat currencies
[66:22] around the world. You know, we can like
[66:24] it, we can not like it, but I think
[66:25] that's the likely outcome. Um, of
[66:28] course, I believe Bitcoin wins longer
[66:30] term, but that to me seems like the
[66:32] short and medium-term
[66:34] uh pathway. So, you know, be wary. Yes,
[66:37] they are surveiled. Yes, they're not
[66:39] decentralized. Um, but, you know, I'm
[66:42] okay with them and I'm okay with using
[66:43] them uh in certain circumstances. Uh,
[66:47] though, of course, I prefer holding
[66:49] Bitcoin. A very real realistic take. I
[66:52] like it. Um, I asked each and every one
[66:55] of my guests um, one question and the
[66:57] question is, "What can we learn from you
[66:59] besides Bitcoin?" Well, I guess am I
[67:01] cheating by just saying uh, you can
[67:02] learn some Austrian economics because
[67:04] that was what my show was also. But, uh,
[67:07] yeah, I think I think the for me it's
[67:10] probably I mean when I started my show
[67:12] it was that it was Bitcoin and Austrian
[67:13] economics. It was this is how you can
[67:15] learn about uh the school of economic
[67:18] thought that is not taught in your
[67:20] school or your university or if it is
[67:22] they might give you a brief mention of
[67:23] Hayek but they won't sort of give you a
[67:26] deeper appreciation of the classics and
[67:29] the you know the people who are as in
[67:31] the um in the in the world of Austrian
[67:33] economics people like Mises and Rothbart
[67:35] and Hopper. It's super interesting
[67:37] because I am Austrian and it was super
[67:40] fun in the beginning because I heard
[67:42] everyone talking about like Ciphedine
[67:44] and you and all all the other ones like
[67:46] uh talking about Austrian economics in
[67:48] the beginning I was like why are they
[67:50] talking about Austria because I didn't
[67:53] know about Austrian economics and I was
[67:55] like nothing is that special about
[67:57] Austrian economics. I know it like it's
[67:58] it's it's not a special economics thing.
[68:01] I like the actual economics of Austria,
[68:03] not the the the theory around that. Uh
[68:06] so I actually learned about Austrian
[68:08] economics as an Austrian just because of
[68:10] Bitcoin. And I went actually for a year
[68:13] to um economics university and I
[68:16] actually talked with one guy that also
[68:19] uh studied economics completely like his
[68:22] full studies uh in uh Austria and he
[68:25] also did not really learn about it. Uh
[68:27] and then I was shocked that like you
[68:29] don't learn about Austrian economics and
[68:30] the theory in the University of Austria
[68:34] in Vienna. I mean there probably are
[68:36] some courses but uh probably not not
[68:39] everyone learns about it which is a
[68:40] shame. You know you know why it's called
[68:41] that right? It was it was like a put
[68:44] down right. So it was kind of the German
[68:46] school and they would look down. It was
[68:48] kind of like a put down. It was kind of
[68:49] oh those Austrian economists. It was
[68:51] actually a put down like decades ago.
[68:54] Um, and then of course nowadays most of
[68:56] the modern-day practitioners of Austrian
[68:58] economics are in the United States,
[69:00] funnily enough, ironically, but that's
[69:02] that's where it came from. That's where
[69:03] the term that's why it was called
[69:04] Austrian economics. And if you look at
[69:06] what Mises was saying, it's not when he
[69:09] was like writing human action and some
[69:11] of these things about methodology. He
[69:13] was trying to just codify or sort of
[69:16] clarify this is what we're doing, right?
[69:17] because from his perspective that was
[69:19] just what good economics is is using
[69:21] this deductive method this the method of
[69:24] the Austrian economists. So it's yeah so
[69:27] I mean that's why it kind of got that
[69:28] name because yeah some of the early you
[69:31] know uh practitioners were Austrians but
[69:33] it was like it was like a put down
[69:34] relative to at that time German school
[69:37] of thought.
[69:39] Interesting. Yeah. Uh yeah we we didn't
[69:42] even touch a economics so maybe we can
[69:44] do it in the second round. Uh but yeah
[69:46] uh thank you so much already we have end
[69:49] in the podcast uh where the previous
[69:51] guest is asking a question for the next
[69:53] guest without knowing who the next guest
[69:55] is and I I think I already know kind of
[69:57] an answer what you will give. Uh the
[70:00] question is what is one non Bitcoin book
[70:03] you can read to learn about Bitcoin?
[70:06] Oh for me there's it's the ethics of
[70:08] money production. I love this book. It's
[70:10] by Gita Hlesman. I did a interview with
[70:13] him and he has a newer book that I did
[70:15] another interview with him on. But
[70:16] honestly, if you read the ethics of
[70:18] money production as a Bitcoiner already,
[70:21] it will just almost it will make you
[70:23] feel even more sure about this thing
[70:27] that we're doing here because it will
[70:29] help you understand the many ways in
[70:31] which fiat currency has hurt society and
[70:34] that you there are better ways if we had
[70:38] real free market sound money. And so I
[70:41] think the ethics of money production
[70:43] doesn't talk about Bitcoin at all and I
[70:44] believe it was released around the time
[70:46] of the white paper funnily enough. So it
[70:48] was that book actually came out in 2008.
[70:51] Um and so yeah it's a fantastic book,
[70:55] one of my favorites. And for people uh
[70:57] that might have not read it, uh if you
[71:00] just put in the name in in Google, you
[71:02] can actually go to the Satoshi Nakamoto
[71:03] Institute and and and like it's it's
[71:05] just a PDF. It's free online. Yeah.
[71:06] Yeah. And the Nakamoto Institute have it
[71:09] there for free. So yeah, definitely go
[71:11] and check it out. It's one of my
[71:12] favorites. Um I I still remember the
[71:15] night I read that book. I think I was
[71:18] away on a work trip or something and I
[71:20] had my laptop and I was bored and I was
[71:22] just sitting in the hotel room cuz I was
[71:24] on a work travel trip and I just read
[71:27] the whole thing in one night. It was
[71:28] just it was just I just kind of went
[71:31] through it and it was just incredible.
[71:33] Really made a difference for me. So, uh,
[71:36] you know, I think a lot of people,
[71:38] especially Bitcoiners, would really
[71:39] enjoy that one. Really cool. Thank you
