[00:00] How do you KYC an AI, right? You can't
[00:03] do it. So, you have to have like you
[00:06] have to rely on p private keys coming
[00:08] from finance. You you think you know
[00:10] what's going on. You think you
[00:12] understand the financial system. You
[00:13] think you understand money and investing
[00:15] and then Bitcoin comes in and turns all
[00:18] of that upside down. We're looking at
[00:20] this thing now. We're waking up to all
[00:22] these lies. There has to be some sort of
[00:24] mechanism by which we can anchor on
[00:27] truth. So, it has to start with
[00:28] ownership. you know the other potential
[00:30] that Bitcoin has as a solution for
[00:32] society. So does that you know if we can
[00:34] get store value then we can start to
[00:36] think about decentralized identity on
[00:38] Bitcoin. We can start to think about
[00:40] cyber security with Bitcoin. We can
[00:42] start to think about all these other use
[00:43] cases that are just going to uh embed it
[00:46] even deeper into our system. You could
[00:48] see us getting to the point where like
[00:49] if you're not signing with private keys,
[00:52] we do not trust this payment. So much
[00:54] fraud and so much corruption could lead
[00:56] to it being like we will accept nothing
[00:59] but Bitcoin.
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] Before we get started, uh just briefly
[01:08] give the people an an overview of of who
[01:11] are you and and why you're excited about
[01:13] uh Bitcoin. Okay. Sure. Yeah. So um my
[01:16] background is in traditional finance. I
[01:18] was in that space for about 25 years um
[01:22] in wealth management and uh found
[01:25] Bitcoin uh like many people in
[01:29] 2017 and it's slowly you know just
[01:32] completely disrupted my view of the
[01:34] financial world. Um, I feel like I
[01:36] learned more about finance from Bitcoin
[01:39] um, since 2017 than I ever learned uh,
[01:43] working in the industry for that many
[01:45] years or at least I felt like I learned
[01:47] the truth, right? Um, so
[01:50] um, I became very vocal and uh, and
[01:53] trying to promote Bitcoin internally.
[01:56] Um, that I I wasn't having much luck. uh
[02:00] had was working at a very traditional
[02:02] firm um that been around for 140 years
[02:06] and
[02:07] um uh they it just didn't connect, you
[02:10] know, with with uh their long-term what
[02:12] they've been doing for so long um that
[02:15] this this thing could disrupt
[02:16] everything. So, um I was stepping
[02:19] outside my traditional role and speaking
[02:21] at meetups and speaking at local uh
[02:25] educational seminars, helping people
[02:27] learn about Bitcoin. Uh, and then in
[02:30] 2022, oh, excuse me, 2020 during COVID,
[02:33] clients, uh, you know, obviously were
[02:35] panicked. They're asking me what I did
[02:37] with my money and we started having
[02:39] conversations about Bitcoin. Uh, and
[02:42] that led to a number of clients sending
[02:44] emails uh, that they wanted to add
[02:46] Bitcoin into their portfolio. The only
[02:48] opportunity I had to do anything like
[02:50] that was GBTC at the time. Um, I sent
[02:53] those emails to the trading desk and of
[02:55] course everybody's at home and the
[02:58] trading desk let it go. I didn't think
[03:00] it was going to happen. So, we had uh,
[03:03] you know, 1 to 3% positions of GBTC in
[03:06] these portfolios. Um, that became 15 to
[03:10] 25% of their portfolio in short order
[03:13] and compliance
[03:15] uh, was in a tizzy. that led to even
[03:19] more in-depth conversations about
[03:20] Bitcoin internally within the firm uh
[03:23] and it just finally came to a point uh
[03:26] where I needed to stop my engagement
[03:28] with Bitcoin or move on and I moved on.
[03:31] So now I work uh with Bite Federal,
[03:34] which is a local Bitcoin ATM company. Um
[03:39] they do uh about for they have about400
[03:42] ATMs in the United States, about 60 in
[03:44] Australia and uh have a non-custodial
[03:48] wallet that a lot of our Bitcoin
[03:50] customers utilize to hold their own
[03:52] keys. Uh we're currently working on a
[03:55] custodial wallet which will be more
[03:58] transactionbased and um uh then they'll
[04:01] be able to move, you know, and it'll
[04:03] also be an on-ramp, right? So people
[04:04] will be able to buy actively and and uh
[04:08] if they want to then move those coins to
[04:10] the non-custodial wallet and hold their
[04:11] own keys, they can. So they'll have both
[04:13] options. Um we have a POS, it's in beta
[04:17] and our uh about 45 customers using the
[04:19] POS system to accept Bitcoin and
[04:22] Lightning payments. Um we did the first
[04:24] lightning payment for gas here in
[04:26] Florida. That was fun. Uh that got a lot
[04:29] of attention on X and a lot of people
[04:30] were driving from a couple hours away to
[04:32] buy gas with lightning. Um yeah, so that
[04:36] that's about it. Um other than that, uh
[04:39] just passionate about Bitcoin and and
[04:41] like to help people learn about it and
[04:44] get involved whenever possible. It's so
[04:47] exciting when there's all of the sudden
[04:49] Bitcoin accepted somewhere where it's
[04:52] usually like uncommon to be accepted. in
[04:54] Switzerland right now. I don't know if
[04:56] you heard the news last week or the the
[04:59] week before or something like that. Spa,
[05:02] a really big supermarket chain, it's in
[05:04] Austria, it's in Germany, it's in
[05:06] Switzerland, like it's a really huge
[05:08] one, is now accepting at one local
[05:11] location in in Citling and Bitcoin, but
[05:16] they are now expanding it the whole of
[05:18] Switzerland. So, all of Switzerland will
[05:20] be able to you will be able to buy with
[05:24] Bitcoin your supermarket thing at a
[05:26] really huge uh really huge chain. And my
[05:30] hope is that they try it out in
[05:32] Switzerland and maybe also do it in
[05:34] Austria, Germany, because they are all
[05:35] over the place. That's wonderful. That's
[05:38] great. It's really cool to see that. And
[05:41] I'm really interested in in in in your
[05:44] before we get with the with the Bitcoin
[05:46] stuff um in your journey because Bitcoin
[05:49] has kind of a way to to suck people in
[05:51] in the in the way. So like there's lot
[05:53] so many people that work something else
[05:56] like you and me and all of the sudden
[05:57] they're like, "Oh, like I not only I
[06:00] want to uh put my financial energy in
[06:02] Bitcoin, but I also want to put my time,
[06:05] my life's energy into Bitcoin."
[06:08] Why was it so apparent for you like all
[06:10] right let's let's completely switch
[06:11] career? Sure. Um I
[06:15] so
[06:17] Bitcoin seems to unlock a desire for
[06:21] truth, right? So it coming from finance,
[06:25] you you think you know what's going on.
[06:26] You think you understand the financial
[06:28] system. You think you understand money
[06:30] and
[06:31] investing. And then Bitcoin comes in and
[06:34] turns all of that upside down.
[06:37] and unlocks
[06:39] a understanding that is more true to
[06:43] reality than any of
[06:46] this matrix of financial products that
[06:49] that currently exist
[06:51] today. And so I I think what it is is
[06:53] that once you realize that whatever that
[06:56] core thing is that you've been doing is
[06:59] all of a sudden a
[07:01] lie and you get a glimpse of the truth.
[07:04] Now, I think you start to clamor for it
[07:08] in all other parts of your life. And I
[07:11] think that's why we see so many
[07:12] Bitcoiners go from uh financial truth to
[07:17] uh what's the truth about a diet? What's
[07:20] the truth about medication? What's the
[07:22] truth about education? What's what's the
[07:23] truth about energy? Right? It's like
[07:26] it's like Bitcoin is like the spoke of
[07:28] this wheel and then we we shoot off and
[07:31] there's so many smart people in our
[07:33] space that there's always somebody to
[07:35] pull you into another rabbit hole and
[07:37] educate you and you have this innate
[07:40] trust with them because they're they're
[07:43] anchored to Bitcoin which you know is
[07:45] this truth machine and so it just it's
[07:48] given me the ability to kind of like
[07:50] quickly now identify and communicate
[07:52] with people who I can value and trust.
[07:55] and and go with them on other journeys
[07:58] and learn. So I think I think this is
[08:00] sort of the thing and that it seems to
[08:02] be
[08:03] a you know seems to be a Bitcoin thing
[08:06] or core to the Bitcoin protocol. You're
[08:09] coming from the traditional financial
[08:11] space and I'm asking myself a lot um
[08:14] there's a lot of traditional financial
[08:16] services. There's a lot of things that
[08:18] are happening outside of Bitcoin and and
[08:22] I'm always wondering what if that will
[08:25] still be there and what if that will not
[08:28] be there for for example central banks
[08:31] uh or like local community banks uh or
[08:34] like those lending things like there's a
[08:37] lot of financial services um that that
[08:41] are important in the traditional
[08:42] financial space and I'm wondering as
[08:44] someone that comes from that space what
[08:46] will survive in a Bitcoin world and and
[08:48] what kind of will maybe die in a Bitcoin
[08:51] world, right? Well, f first I think it's
[08:54] important to understand that that it's
[08:55] going to take a long time for that stuff
[08:56] to die off, at least here in the United
[08:58] States.
[08:59] Um, you know, and I think that's going
[09:02] to like, for example, my my
[09:05] my kids' generation, right? They they
[09:08] were baffled by what a check was because
[09:11] I have them banking uh all with mobile
[09:14] apps and and Bitcoin and online. And uh
[09:18] the other day my son got paid with a
[09:20] check. He's like, "What? Like this is
[09:22] doesn't make any sense, right? This is
[09:24] paper. Like this is just number like
[09:26] what? How is this even possible?" he was
[09:28] just baffled by it. Um, so I think it
[09:32] just generationally will dissipate and
[09:35] and go away. Um, but there's so much
[09:40] money tied up in the old system
[09:43] um that uh it's going to take boomers
[09:47] and and then others passing their wealth
[09:49] to the next generation before we see
[09:51] that stuff fade away. But I think it's
[09:53] going to become less and less important.
[09:55] Um, and and you know, I always hold a
[09:59] space for complete
[10:02] collapse because there's there's all
[10:06] sorts of um timelines that could unfold,
[10:09] right? And and um if but you know that
[10:13] that question of collapse becomes
[10:16] doesn't necessarily mean that the old
[10:18] system dies. It might just mean that it
[10:20] morphs into a stable coin and uh
[10:24] digital banking infrastructure, right?
[10:27] Where we're we do have Bitcoin, but we
[10:30] also have
[10:33] centralized digital infrastructure that
[10:35] we're interacting with and that that
[10:38] that Wall Street Trafi system just
[10:41] morphs into that and the players sort of
[10:43] change and some some die off and some
[10:46] move forward. Um, I think we're kind of
[10:49] seeing that
[10:50] today. So, I think the only only way
[10:53] that goes away is in a a
[10:57] complete collapse scenario. And and I
[10:59] don't know that any of us really want to
[11:03] experience that or even want our friends
[11:05] and family to experience that. Um, as
[11:09] much as I as I would love to see a
[11:11] Bitcoin only future, uh, I think the the
[11:14] best thing that can happen is a a slower
[11:17] transition where people volunteer to be
[11:21] a part of that Bitcoin standard as
[11:22] opposed to having it, you know, thrust
[11:24] upon them.
[11:26] Yeah, it's it's a good point. You you
[11:29] need the grassroots movements. Um I mean
[11:32] we we see what problems come uh in El
[11:36] Salvador was was an interesting thing
[11:37] because there was a grassroots movement
[11:39] but then all of the sudden very early on
[11:42] uh someone uh tried Nuk tried to also
[11:45] push it down from from uh from the top
[11:48] and it went good but also there was some
[11:51] some bad things coming with that and it
[11:54] was just really quickly because I I also
[11:56] had in my whole life just one physical
[11:58] check in my my my my hands and I
[12:01] couldn't redeem it. I I actually put it
[12:04] in my waste paper basket. It was like I
[12:06] don't know $15 or something like that. I
[12:08] was running from bank to bank and I for
[12:11] some reason I couldn't get it out of
[12:13] there. So I can really relate to that.
[12:15] First I'm getting that I'm like is that
[12:17] a joke? Like right what what the hell
[12:21] did I just How can this be true? How can
[12:23] you just write your name on paper and it
[12:25] somebody can turn that in for money?
[12:27] Yeah. But but the same thing is that's
[12:30] actually might be an interesting thing
[12:31] because um the same thing can be true
[12:34] for for now the normal currency the
[12:36] normal money that you're using and
[12:39] someone in the future is like how how
[12:41] did you how did you trust that? Everyone
[12:43] can just print that like that that that
[12:45] doesn't seem secure. you need to verify
[12:47] that on the on the blockchain like how
[12:49] the hell did you and that might be that
[12:51] might be where we're going right when
[12:52] you start to think about um the chaos
[12:56] that an a that AI could create in the
[12:58] wrong hands. I mean I mean the amount of
[13:02] um cloning or fraudulent transactions
[13:04] that that that could be that might be
[13:07] coming could could you know I mean
[13:09] that's one discussion I had um recently
[13:13] with with a friend about how
[13:16] much fraud there is right now in the
[13:19] system because of
[13:20] AI and if that gets levered up to where
[13:23] you just cannot trust a transaction
[13:27] um that that you can't trust that it'll
[13:29] settle without it being pushed, right?
[13:33] Cuz like we pull so much right now, like
[13:35] we're doing a pull and we're we're
[13:36] pulling these the credit cards are uh
[13:39] extending credit and there's all this
[13:41] delayed settlement in the system that uh
[13:45] an individual right now and an an
[13:48] individual leveraging AI can massively
[13:50] take advantage of the system and get
[13:54] like you could get goods delivered from
[13:55] Amazon the next day. you could get your
[13:57] Bitcoin instantly and reverse those
[14:00] transactions, right? And then go set up
[14:02] another account, another identity, blah
[14:04] blah blah. So, so with that in mind, you
[14:08] could see us getting to the point where
[14:09] like if you're not signing with private
[14:12] keys, we do not trust this payment. And
[14:15] then what what does that mean for
[14:16] adoption, right? that that that's one of
[14:18] those things where like so much fraud
[14:21] and so much corruption could lead to it
[14:23] being like we will accept nothing but
[14:27] Bitcoin. That that's that's a good
[14:29] point. Do you think AI ultimately
[14:32] enhances the the Bitcoin adoption? I
[14:35] think it does. I think it does in a big
[14:36] way. Yeah, we we have these
[14:38] conversations all the time at work. Um,
[14:41] you know, we we we were recently talking
[14:42] about like what does an AI um
[14:46] potentially hire humans to do some sort
[14:49] of work uh on a task that needs to be
[14:52] done in the physical world and
[14:56] then, you know, pays them in Bitcoin and
[14:59] they go to the Bitcoin ATM to turn that
[15:01] into cash? or does a does a human go out
[15:05] and do services for cash and bring it to
[15:07] the ATM and convert it to Bitcoin to pay
[15:09] the AI like it's fee or whatever it's
[15:12] doing like who knows right I mean I
[15:14] think there's going to be a really wild
[15:17] interface between humans and AI going
[15:19] forward and
[15:22] um I think Bitcoin is the currency of
[15:23] that space for sure
[15:26] how do you like how do you KYC an AI
[15:30] right you can't do it So you have to
[15:33] have like you have to rely on p private
[15:36] keys and that that AI controls its own
[15:39] private keys and it can sign and push
[15:42] out a
[15:42] payment then that's how you
[15:47] verified by private keys because we we
[15:50] want to empower this robotic future
[15:54] um then it has to we have to rely on
[15:56] private public private key pairs. can't
[15:58] rely on identity anymore because you can
[16:01] fake identity with AI is so good. The
[16:04] voice, the sound, everything. Yeah.
[16:07] Right. So, I mean, you know, I know
[16:09] strategy is working on something of this
[16:12] type and lots of other projects have
[16:13] worked on decentralized identity. Uh but
[16:16] at the end of the day, right, it all the
[16:18] simple way to look at it, it comes down
[16:20] to like do you control the private key
[16:23] and therefore you can push a payment and
[16:26] then we're not going to worry about
[16:27] who's on the other end and then people
[16:29] will laugh at us from the future that we
[16:32] accept that paper that you can literally
[16:34] print out of a printer. Yeah, AI is
[16:37] going to laugh at us for sure like you
[16:39] crazy people.
[16:41] AI, I think, is already laughing at us
[16:43] that the questions that we pose to AI
[16:45] are like, "Oh, like that's so obvious.
[16:47] Come on, do better humans." Yeah,
[16:49] exactly. That's good stuff. I actually
[16:52] want to do that. Um, I I didn't get to
[16:55] that, but I want to have a podcast like
[16:58] that with with with an AI. Probably like
[17:01] chat GPD is probably a good one. uh just
[17:04] have a conversation because I've seen
[17:05] some people do it when it came out and I
[17:09] think now it's so much more advanced
[17:11] that it actually could be an interesting
[17:13] uh chat. And I know I've heard Jeff
[17:15] Booth talk about um an AI brain that an
[17:19] avatar that he's created of himself that
[17:22] he sends to meetings. Um he's mentioned
[17:25] this on a couple different podcasts. It
[17:26] might be interesting to try and have a
[17:28] podcast with his avatar.
[17:30] Oh gosh, that would be so fun. It would
[17:32] be because I had Jeff on I think two
[17:34] times already. So it would be so fun to
[17:37] Who knows maybe you are talking to his
[17:39] avatar
[17:41] then it would be very good one right if
[17:44] you ask him and he says well you've
[17:45] already done it
[17:46] [Laughter]
[17:48] Rob that would be pretty awesome. He's
[17:50] like yeah like uh the third time let's
[17:52] do it again.
[17:55] It's but it's it's it's I mean I don't
[17:58] know how much this has to do with
[18:00] Bitcoin but it's a really interesting
[18:02] question of how we move forward. It's
[18:04] already now on Twitter or on any social
[18:08] media app for that matter but I'm mostly
[18:10] on on Twitter. When you see a
[18:13] video, the first thing you're like is is
[18:16] that if you see something crazy, you
[18:19] first like is that
[18:20] AI? You this you always have that kind
[18:23] of suspicion that is that AI and usually
[18:26] if it's AI, there's like community notes
[18:28] coming up and like like this is AI
[18:30] because of that and that but we just in
[18:32] the beginning of that phase. Absolutely.
[18:35] I got a story about that. So, um, we had
[18:39] a, uh, like a week here where there was
[18:43] orbs all over where I live. And so, you
[18:48] would hear like Blackhawk helicopters
[18:50] and you'd go outside, right? And you'd
[18:51] see them following these orbs. So, we
[18:55] shot video of it and I put it on my ex
[18:59] account like cuz this was just crazy.
[19:02] And it's like these two orbs, Blackhawk
[19:05] helicopter, and they're just like
[19:06] following each other around, you know?
[19:09] So, I shot it. My friend shot it. Like,
[19:12] we know it. We saw it. Like, we know it
[19:14] wasn't AI. But I put it on X. And
[19:18] comments are like, "Yeah, that's BS.
[19:20] That's AI." I could see the orbs move
[19:22] through the tree like this way. Like,
[19:23] they're making all these points about
[19:25] how it was fake video. And I was just
[19:27] dying. I was like, "There's nothing you
[19:29] can do." like we live in a post-trust
[19:32] world. It doesn't matter um what what
[19:35] you know, everybody's going to have
[19:37] their own interpretation and think it's
[19:39] a lie or a scam. So, so like like what
[19:42] like what's the value of even trying to
[19:44] convince anybody of anything? You have
[19:46] to live like just in your own truth and
[19:49] and find your own way. like it it's
[19:51] really it's a it's a wild experience to
[19:53] see people just uh blatantly uh think
[19:57] that you're scamming them when you're
[19:59] trying to do your best thing. And that's
[20:01] happened, I'm sure, with you as well.
[20:03] Like when you're when you're talking
[20:04] about Bitcoin, there's some people that
[20:06] just like as much as you feel and know
[20:08] it's real and true, they they will never
[20:12] accept it or they won't they think
[20:14] you're trying to do something. They
[20:17] think you're trying to scam them or
[20:18] something, you know. Oh, yeah. It's it's
[20:20] uh I get that all all it all the time.
[20:24] Oh, you're just talking about Bitcoin
[20:25] because you know pump the price and I
[20:27] always take it as a compliment that
[20:29] someone thinks I can pump the Bitcoin
[20:31] price.
[20:34] Exactly. It's like Yeah, of course. I I
[20:38] say buy Bitcoin and like all of a sudden
[20:40] we have plus 10%. Yeah. And then they
[20:43] turn around and go, hey man, you know
[20:44] anything about hex?
[20:47] But it's an interesting thing. Um, you
[20:50] said post trust world. So like basically
[20:52] a trustless world. What do you think the
[20:54] role of Bitcoin will be? I feel like
[20:57] Bitcoin is the only thing you can trust
[20:59] at point then, right? No, absolutely.
[21:01] And I think once you understand that, I
[21:04] think this is why a lot of people start
[21:06] thinking in terms of blockchain. you
[21:08] know, they go they understand Bitcoin,
[21:11] they they look at the consensus
[21:13] mechanism and they go, let's apply this
[21:14] to every place where there's no trust or
[21:16] we need more
[21:18] trust. Um, which then of course leads to
[21:21] them doing a lot of things that they
[21:22] probably shouldn't do. But, um, yeah, I
[21:26] think like I like we said before, when
[21:28] you start thinking about AI, you start
[21:30] thinking about fraud, you start thinking
[21:31] about
[21:33] um, can I trust this video? Can I trust
[21:36] that this politician really said
[21:38] something?
[21:39] Right? We, you know, we're playing, we
[21:43] have actively right now at Bif Federal,
[21:45] we have a what we call a digital notary,
[21:48] but it's it's basically so that you can
[21:50] embed data into the blockchain, right?
[21:54] So, it's it's a timestamp, a open time
[21:57] stamp. It's all open source stuff.
[21:59] But, you know, it allows you to say take
[22:02] a video. Let's say you captured a video
[22:04] of a politician doing something corrupt
[22:06] and you wanted to embed that in the
[22:08] Bitcoin blockchain so it's available
[22:10] forever and it's timestamped and it
[22:12] couldn't be taken down, you know? Um,
[22:15] it's that kind of stuff, right? So if
[22:18] we're as a species going through this
[22:21] great awakening, right, where we're
[22:23] we're we're figuring out that maybe, you
[22:26] know, money was a lie, maybe our history
[22:29] is a lie, maybe the where humanity came
[22:32] from is a lie, this food system's a lie.
[22:35] Like if if we're looking at this thing
[22:37] now, we're waking up to all these lies.
[22:40] There has to be some sort of mechanism
[22:42] by which we can anchor on truth. And
[22:46] bitcoin is is the first one and money
[22:49] was the or you know bitcoin is the first
[22:52] but it's also the the best protocol we
[22:54] have right now for anchoring truth. So
[22:56] money was the first use
[22:57] case ID identity become could become a
[23:01] second use case. Um you know logging uh
[23:06] and
[23:07] recording
[23:08] timestamping stuff that we need to
[23:10] preserve for the future could be a
[23:13] second or a third use case. And I think
[23:15] more more will come. Um you know Jason
[23:19] Lowry is talking about using uh Bitcoin
[23:22] as basically a cyber security
[23:25] uh powerhouse or engine that is going to
[23:28] protect data right from from being
[23:30] altered in the future as well. So
[23:33] there's there's a lot of interesting
[23:35] things that are going to come from this
[23:37] massive protocol being adopted globally.
[23:40] Money is just the first. Um, it's kind
[23:43] of it's it's kind of cool that Satoshi
[23:46] applied it to money
[23:48] because that's a great way to hack
[23:50] people into the system. You know,
[23:52] nothing like greed to get people to
[23:55] adopt something. Nothing, you know,
[23:57] especially if you're trying to pull them
[23:58] out of fiat. I know when when I first
[24:00] got into Bitcoin and and many many of
[24:02] the other people that I've watched, we
[24:04] get into it because it's like, oh my
[24:05] god, we're we're going to make a ton of
[24:07] money. And then over time it evolves
[24:09] into like, oh my god, this is so much
[24:11] more important than money. And and this
[24:14] could really provide massive benefits to
[24:17] humanity in all these different ways.
[24:20] Not only from the the culture of having
[24:22] a hard money, but then all the other
[24:25] things like we're talking about here now
[24:27] that that could be built on top of this
[24:29] system. And so, um, that that I think is
[24:34] just a a a natural outgrowth of this,
[24:38] um, trust machine that I think is going
[24:41] to become incredibly important to a
[24:43] society that's waking up. Let's take a
[24:45] break for a moment and appreciate the
[24:47] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[24:50] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[24:53] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[24:56] of showing that you are a true
[24:59] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[25:01] dropped a completely new and amazing
[25:04] Genesis edition of their watch
[25:07] collections. You have the date of the
[25:09] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[25:12] and of course also the block height and
[25:15] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[25:18] the level of detail they put in in this
[25:21] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[25:23] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[25:26] down in the descriptions. I love those
[25:28] watches. so so much. And now if you have
[25:32] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[25:34] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[25:36] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[25:38] to deal with that. The first way is you
[25:41] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[25:43] entry for you to get into the
[25:46] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[25:49] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[25:52] super simple and secure way. And if you
[25:54] check out the link in the description,
[25:56] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[25:59] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[26:02] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[26:05] partner in terms of how to get the most
[26:08] out of your sovereignty. They will
[26:11] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[26:14] that is perfect for your individual
[26:17] situation. They will show you how you
[26:19] can secure your own devices. Securing
[26:22] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[26:24] have to keep all your devices secure.
[26:26] One topic that is overlooked often is
[26:29] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[26:31] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[26:34] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[26:37] place already? And last but not least,
[26:39] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[26:41] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[26:43] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[26:48] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[26:51] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[26:54] be for the first time ever speaking at
[26:57] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[26:59] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[27:02] really looking forward to seeing all of
[27:04] you there. You can get your ticket in
[27:06] the link down in the description of
[27:09] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[27:11] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[27:15] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[27:16] there. But isn't money the the the
[27:19] biggest problem of like it's the most
[27:22] fundamental problem because it touches
[27:24] like all the other aspects? Yeah, I
[27:26] agree. I would agree with that 100%.
[27:29] Yeah, it's it's like it makes a lot of
[27:30] sense to start with with with money. Um
[27:35] because money is the the thing where we
[27:38] store our financial but also our lives
[27:41] energy in and solving this trust solves
[27:45] already so many other things. So that
[27:48] that's a that's a it's a great way to to
[27:51] start it also. I'm I'm just thinking out
[27:54] loud here. when we are having now
[27:58] central
[27:59] institutions and and we're putting a lot
[28:02] of trust in them. This works is if you
[28:05] cannot fake an central institution but
[28:08] now you can fake anything. You might
[28:12] have talked to I don't know uh there's a
[28:15] bank institution and there's a guy that
[28:17] you always talk to. Now all of the
[28:19] sudden the same guy calls you at home
[28:23] has the same voice than he has when you
[28:26] in the bank and he asks you oh uh can
[28:28] you please just like give me that data
[28:30] and stuff like that and your money is
[28:32] gone because you thought this is this
[28:34] guy and if this comes more and more down
[28:37] in society and this those things already
[28:39] started and then will just get even even
[28:42] more and more and even worse. So this
[28:45] completely erodess
[28:47] the trust into those central uh
[28:50] authorities because you don't even know
[28:52] if those central authorities are the
[28:55] real ones or the fake ones. You have no
[28:57] way of knowing it. So in a way those
[29:00] things make us more decentralized and uh
[29:04] make us more make us all more a little
[29:07] bit more cipher punk if you know what I
[29:09] mean. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I I mean
[29:12] that's already happened to clients of
[29:15] mine that um an AI voice replica fooled
[29:19] them into thinking their grandson was in
[29:23] dire need and they lost
[29:26] $120,000. It was shocking to hear that
[29:30] story from them. So it's already being
[29:32] done. And um so that that if if you live
[29:38] I when I think about this and I start to
[29:40] think about living in a world where you
[29:42] cannot trust any source then
[29:45] community becomes more
[29:48] valuable. Interpersonal relationships
[29:50] become more valuable. Bitcoin becomes
[29:52] more valuable. Physical resources become
[29:55] more
[29:55] valuable. And I also believe that
[29:58] spirituality and connection to source
[30:03] or consciousness whatever however you
[30:05] would like to describe that becomes
[30:08] incredibly valuable.
[30:10] So uh because that leads to higher
[30:15] cognitive recognition of your intuition,
[30:18] right? Like like that that connection
[30:20] between intuition and your
[30:22] your mental kind of focus or real world
[30:28] uh logical interactions.
[30:31] So, I think this is part of the process
[30:34] that we're all going through is like how
[30:36] how do we live in a highly technological
[30:38] world where everything could be
[30:40] faked and still does that either push
[30:44] you over the
[30:45] edge and you become not
[30:49] human or does that elevate humanity in a
[30:52] way where you you you rise above and
[30:56] and evolve beyond and above and and and
[30:59] technology maintains itself as a tool
[31:02] that this higher level being can then
[31:04] use to to bring things into
[31:08] materium. So like I I and I I tend to be
[31:12] positive and I tend to think and that
[31:15] this future is going to be uh the
[31:18] upswing.
[31:19] Um, I like to I look at all the
[31:22] negativity and I I understand it and I
[31:25] fear it, but I feel like if we focus on
[31:27] how to get to these other levels, we can
[31:30] we can use technology as a tool to be
[31:33] elevate our species. So, uh, I I I think
[31:36] the post trust or posttruth world is
[31:39] going to drive that division and you're
[31:41] you're going to have to make your choice
[31:44] which path you're going to go and I
[31:46] think it's going to be a lot of work to
[31:47] get there for a lot of people. I mean in
[31:50] the past technology always advanced
[31:53] human humanity um on on I mean of course
[31:58] you can also look at it in a bad way but
[32:01] mostly in the big inventions and
[32:04] discoveries that we made starting from
[32:06] the printing press to electricity and
[32:08] all those
[32:09] things advanced humanity brought
[32:12] humanity closer to each other and gave
[32:16] humanity more tools so we can do even
[32:19] more things. One of like a a a
[32:25] mid-range from the a guy from the middle
[32:27] class right now is way richer than the
[32:31] richest guy alive 200 years ago. He he
[32:33] can do a lot more than the richest guy
[32:36] 200 years ago, which is crazy to think
[32:39] how much a guy in 2050 or 2140 or
[32:46] something like that can do because he
[32:50] has so much more resources uh in in his
[32:54] or so many so much better so many better
[32:58] tools and and and skills at his disposal
[33:02] than someone that is now like at past we
[33:05] always look at almost like they're like
[33:08] grave people. Um but they they aren't
[33:12] but we have so much better tools in our
[33:15] if you just look back five years if if
[33:18] you have Google versus if you have an AI
[33:22] at your fingertips that makes a huge
[33:24] difference in how fast you can find
[33:26] things and how fast you can do things
[33:28] and learn and learn. Wow. Yeah. So I I
[33:32] do hope and I'm always optimistic uh
[33:34] that all those
[33:37] technology all those discoveries and
[33:40] inventions that we are having now AI and
[33:42] Bitcoin primarily will advance humanity
[33:46] a lot and we like wow that this was
[33:49] really profound and important for us.
[33:50] All of the sudden we can advance uh
[33:53] technology a lot faster and
[33:56] better. And the only flip side to that
[34:00] is the people
[34:01] that get it very late. Yeah. Uh get left
[34:05] behind. But even the last person in
[34:09] Bitcoin will still have a better life
[34:11] because of Bitcoin even though he's the
[34:13] last person to actually adopt it. Yeah,
[34:16] I agree.
[34:18] I I guess I I I'm beginning to build
[34:22] like this hopeful vision of AI because
[34:25] Ive I've used it. My son has used it
[34:28] enough to
[34:29] see where it could have like major
[34:32] impacts on things outside the computer
[34:36] screen. And um we we've been using it
[34:40] recently to work on um designing a boat
[34:43] and and
[34:44] and working on plans for for that.
[34:49] And you start to think about uploading
[34:52] those plans to a robot
[34:55] that we could then upload instructions
[34:57] and teach it how to
[34:59] weld. And all of a sudden, right, you're
[35:01] you're you become this manufacturing um
[35:05] you have all this manufacturing
[35:06] capability uh with mechanical devices
[35:09] that are going to get cheaper and
[35:11] cheaper and cheaper relative to Bitcoin.
[35:12] Incredibly powerful. I mean, I I can I
[35:15] can imagine doing all sorts of things
[35:17] with a robot and an AI brain that um
[35:21] would scale my capability to feed my
[35:25] family, build the devices I want to
[35:28] automate things around my home on the
[35:32] farm. There's there's so many great
[35:35] things that could be invented
[35:38] um that are unique to your situation.
[35:40] So, it's like I just see this future
[35:42] where raw materials and basic
[35:45] resources and Bitcoin and
[35:49] AI become the tools for sort of
[35:53] unlimited abundance or at least giving
[35:55] people the ability to really be
[35:57] sovereign should they choose it, right?
[36:00] Because I mean, we've had to rely on so
[36:03] many third parties for so many things.
[36:06] If my AI is my doctor, is my engineer,
[36:11] is my accountant, is
[36:14] my business plan developer, you know,
[36:18] um, you name it, right? I mean, that's
[36:21] that's just scales the individual at a
[36:23] at a phenomenal rate. Like, I think what
[36:26] we're going to do is mind-blowing. And I
[36:30] think, you know, if if you combine that
[36:32] with an everinccreasing Bitcoin
[36:33] purchasing power, that's true individual
[36:37] sovereignty,
[36:38] right? That's what I'm so excited about
[36:41] in the future. You You want to build a
[36:43] boat? Yes. A big big boat for the next
[36:48] flood. Yeah. No, we we've already built
[36:51] a little a little aluminum skiff. That
[36:53] was his first project, and now we're
[36:55] looking at something more substantial.
[36:57] and um and AI is helping us with that.
[37:01] It's it's super interesting because it
[37:04] makes us think about the proof of work
[37:08] or or let's say in general work because
[37:12] if if there's robots and they have
[37:17] brains, do humans even need to work
[37:19] anymore? If if if a robot can just do
[37:25] cook for us, clean for us, build things
[37:29] for us, get us to space, and do all the
[37:32] things that we're now doing, like why
[37:37] would humans need to work? And then
[37:39] also, how do we keep track of things?
[37:42] How is entrepreneurship looking? and and
[37:44] and and what importance has Bitcoin in a
[37:48] world
[37:49] where mo like 99% of the things are done
[37:53] by robots that are set up once they they
[37:56] can build themselves, they can manage
[37:58] themselves. We like it's a crazy thing
[38:02] to think about. Yeah, it it's really
[38:05] exciting. I mean, you can obviously can
[38:07] go down this rabbit hole like, well,
[38:09] they're going to turn against us and
[38:10] murder us and all that, but
[38:13] um I'm not I'm not so sure that that's
[38:16] going to be the case. But if you know if
[38:18] if you want to take the positive route
[38:21] and you you start to think about
[38:24] alleviating all those burdens from your
[38:26] life of like I I've got to work in order
[38:29] to go to the store and get food and to
[38:32] pay my medical bills and to put gas in
[38:34] the car and
[38:35] d if those costs shrink
[38:38] dramatically because of AI while
[38:40] simultaneously Bitcoin is growing in
[38:42] purchasing power uh it's not going to
[38:45] take a lot of Bitcoin to become
[38:46] sovereign.
[38:48] in in that future. So, and when I say
[38:51] sovereign, I mean like exactly what you
[38:53] said, like I my robot's doing that for
[38:55] me. If your robots's doing that for you,
[38:58] then then what are you spending your
[39:00] time
[39:01] doing? And this is where I think it
[39:04] leads people to a more spiritual path,
[39:08] whatever that looks like for you, right?
[39:10] of, you know, the time and energy to sit
[39:14] and think about why am I here? As
[39:17] opposed to I got to get a cup of coffee
[39:19] and I got to go to work and I got to go
[39:21] go here and I got this meeting, I got
[39:23] that meeting and then I, you know, I got
[39:24] to get home and pay my bills and do my
[39:26] taxes and blah blah blah blah blah. If
[39:28] you can sit there and and that can be
[39:30] taken care of for you and you can spend
[39:31] your time on like why am I here? What's
[39:33] my purpose? and what how do I make this
[39:37] a better what am I going to learn from
[39:39] this experience how can I make this a
[39:41] better experience what you know these
[39:43] are bigger questions that I think we're
[39:46] all here to try and answer but we don't
[39:50] get the time and we don't have the
[39:51] energy to focus on it that we deserve
[39:56] it also makes you think
[39:57] about what if those
[40:00] robots all use Bitcoin to communicate
[40:03] value to each other. And what does it
[40:08] mean if you have a control of 0.1
[40:13] Bitcoin, one Bitcoin, 10 Bitcoin,
[40:15] whatever you
[40:17] have, because dividing 8 billion people
[40:21] to 21 million Bitcoin is one thing, but
[40:25] add to those 8 billion people 50 billion
[40:28] robots that also want to have those
[40:30] Bitcoin makes that Bitcoin a lot more
[40:33] valuable all of a sudden. and is that
[40:36] deflationary uh power is is even bigger.
[40:39] I never thought about that. Uh
[40:41] interesting. And what if they what if
[40:43] they need to like hey we need to stream
[40:45] sats and we need to do it in a more
[40:46] secure way so that I can hire other AI
[40:48] agents. So I and I don't think the code
[40:51] is working properly. So I'm going to
[40:54] adjust the lightning code myself with
[40:57] these other AI agents so that we can
[41:00] evolve the system to a point that we can
[41:01] use it better. Like is going to
[41:04] accelerate at a rapid rate. I mean
[41:06] that's just like any one of these AI
[41:08] rabbit holes whenever I get into this
[41:10] discussion we're just constantly blown
[41:11] away at how fast this stuff's going to
[41:13] change the world and it's just getting
[41:16] started. I mean what was it like when
[41:18] did chat GBT come out? like 2020 like
[41:20] during COVID and it was like oh yeah I
[41:22] can I can write a better email or I can
[41:24] and now we're using it for unbelievable
[41:30] things combined with all the other
[41:32] agents that are out there. It's it's
[41:33] it's mind-blowing. It came out I think
[41:36] later than that. I think 2022 only. Is
[41:39] that what it was? Yeah. It's gone really
[41:41] fast. Yeah. I just see uh initial
[41:45] release date is November 30, 2022. There
[41:48] you go. It's It's kind of a weird kind
[41:52] of like during peak peak inflation in
[41:54] the United States and then that gets
[41:56] released and we've been going downhill
[41:57] ever since. Yeah. It's um it also makes
[42:01] inflation look better than it actually
[42:03] is, right? Yes. Yeah. 100%. It's the
[42:06] whole theory. I mean, we we talked
[42:08] already about Jeff Poof and the AI agent
[42:11] of Jeff Poof, the AI Jeff would now say,
[42:14] "Yeah, we you you don't have to measure
[42:16] from the zero. you have to measure from
[42:18] the productivity level of humanity and
[42:21] then you have the true inflation rate
[42:23] which uh I think is a very true thing
[42:26] and uh is is not often enough talked
[42:29] about right and it's
[42:32] it's like do they right you can you can
[42:35] you can make the re the reasoning that
[42:38] deflation through AI is going to allow
[42:42] governments to print extraordinary
[42:43] amounts of money and devalue the debt
[42:46] and kick the can down the road.
[42:51] The other uh another scenario would be
[42:54] like if they if they don't print and we
[42:56] get a we get this much deflation that's
[42:59] a complete default of the debt and it
[43:01] breaks the system. Like if they
[43:03] miscalculate how much deflation is
[43:06] coming and they don't print fast enough
[43:08] or they don't print at all because some
[43:12] powers that be uh are more interested in
[43:15] trying to uh collapse humanity and for
[43:20] more of a control structure, right? Like
[43:22] in 1929
[43:24] uh we didn't print. There was a central
[43:27] bank. they didn't print and they got a
[43:29] lot more control out of not printing. So
[43:33] that that's another option, right? Is it
[43:35] I mean we we hear a lot in the space
[43:37] about they have to print, they have to
[43:38] print. True. If they want to keep the
[43:40] game
[43:41] going, if there's powers of be that
[43:44] don't necessarily want to keep the game
[43:45] going, that want to put extreme amount
[43:47] of pressure on humanity to try and seize
[43:50] control, then the the move would be not
[43:53] to print.
[43:54] So, I think it's, you know, either way,
[43:59] Bitcoin excels in purchasing power
[44:02] against all other forms of currency. So,
[44:07] um, but, you know, it's it's it's
[44:10] interesting to just kind of think about
[44:12] those different scenarios because
[44:13] they're they're radically different and
[44:15] I think the average Bitcoiner is only
[44:18] thinking in terms of the the print
[44:19] that's coming. It's the whole game
[44:21] theory of the the person that embraces
[44:25] new technology right now that would be
[44:27] EI and Bitcoin will not only have will
[44:32] not only be way more productive and have
[44:35] get done a lot more but also have the
[44:38] superior store of value to store that
[44:40] financial energy properly and those will
[44:43] be the new kings and queens of of the
[44:45] world and those who are kind of saying
[44:48] oh AI is is all bad. You should not do
[44:51] it because they will they they will kill
[44:54] us one day and no, we should not use
[44:56] Bitcoin because I don't know it's
[44:58] burning the for forest or whatever you
[45:00] want to say about
[45:01] Bitcoin. Those who will just get left
[45:03] behind. So it I I have a lot of empathy
[45:07] for for Bitcoin haters because they will
[45:09] live in a in a world that won't be as
[45:12] good for them. Uh it will be still be
[45:14] better than now. So they will still
[45:16] benefit from those technologies but they
[45:18] will not benefit to the same extent as
[45:21] those people who actually embrace it
[45:22] early. And in both Bitcoin and and and
[45:26] AI we extremely early. I think we are
[45:29] just just just briefly seeing what's
[45:31] actually possible with those
[45:32] technologies, right? We're in that like
[45:34] cat video to YouTube phase.
[45:38] That that that is that is crazy. Um, how
[45:41] would you actually describe of of where
[45:43] we are in into the let's say there's a
[45:46] point where we have hyper bitcoinization
[45:48] and then there's like 2009. How would
[45:50] you describe where we are currently? Um,
[45:53] I I think we have quite a ways to go
[45:55] before we get hyper bitcoinization.
[45:59] Um, I
[46:02] I guess we we have to define hyper
[46:04] bitcoinization, right? if hyper
[46:06] bitcoinization is is that it becomes the
[46:09] predominant
[46:11] uh medium of exchange and unit of
[46:14] account and store of value. Um if that's
[46:18] how we're going to define it then yeah I
[46:20] think we have a long ways to go. If it's
[46:22] just uh if we're just going to measure
[46:24] it by store of value and it becoming
[46:26] sort of a the treasury asset of
[46:30] sovereigns and big corporations I think
[46:32] we're we're pretty I think we're on the
[46:34] precipice of that happening. So I think
[46:36] as a as a dominating store value, I
[46:38] think that's within the next couple of
[46:41] cycles. As a medium of exchange, I I'm
[46:46] I'm I'm thinking it's going to be more
[46:50] in
[46:51] the 15 to 25 years and then unit of
[46:56] account where sovereigns are just
[46:58] completely given up. You know, it's a
[47:00] much longer term maybe 50 years out. we
[47:03] already seeing kind of the first step
[47:05] towards with nation states now into
[47:08] Bitcoin with big corporations with bit
[47:11] into Bitcoin with even like Black Rockck
[47:13] uh into Bitcoin which all of that wasn't
[47:17] the case just let's say three to four
[47:20] years ago I mean Micro Strategy if you
[47:23] count that as a big institution then you
[47:25] have to go back four and a half years
[47:27] ago how do you look at the rapid pace of
[47:30] adoption for Bitcoin as a store of
[47:32] video. Yeah, I I
[47:34] I I'm obviously excited about it. I
[47:38] think I think it the more
[47:40] um uh entities and individuals adopted a
[47:44] store value is incredibly exciting. I
[47:47] it's going to be um it's the first step,
[47:50] right, to all all of those people and
[47:52] entities starting to think like us that
[47:56] this could be a solution for other
[47:57] things. So, it has to start with
[47:59] ownership just like it did for us. It
[48:01] starts with ownership and then from
[48:03] there you'll start to think about
[48:06] Bitcoin as you know the other potential
[48:08] that Bitcoin has as a solution for
[48:10] society. So does that you know if we can
[48:12] get store value then we can start to
[48:15] think about decentralized identity on
[48:17] Bitcoin. We can start to think about
[48:19] cyber security with Bitcoin. We can
[48:21] start to think about all these other use
[48:22] cases that are just going to uh embed it
[48:25] even deeper into our system. And then of
[48:28] course you'll get you know unit of
[48:30] account and medium of exchange. So um
[48:33] it's the first step. It's shocking how
[48:36] fast it changed that that was you know
[48:40] in just like wild. It's it seems like
[48:44] but at the same time right I guess it's
[48:46] like like talk is faster especially in
[48:49] in at the institutional level talk about
[48:52] adoption is move moves so much faster
[48:54] than actual ownership. uh in a and and
[48:59] then and then do they have ownership in
[49:01] a sovereign way? Uh meaning do they hold
[49:03] their own keys? Right? So there's
[49:05] there's still a lot of education. It's
[49:07] great that they're there and they're
[49:09] going to start buying. Right? But we
[49:11] have to move them now from like, oh,
[49:13] I'll just buy the ETF because it's easy
[49:15] to I'll buy real Bitcoin and I'll hold
[49:17] my own keys and uh then how do we set up
[49:20] a multi-IG for a government or an
[49:22] institution? you know, all stuff that
[49:25] we've we think is probably fairly
[49:27] straightforward and and but for them is
[49:30] is you just, you know, it's a big
[49:32] learning curve, especially when you need
[49:33] to convince a board or you need to
[49:35] convince
[49:37] um you know, a bank uh to help you with
[49:40] these things. So, it the it's awesome
[49:43] that it's there. I think the the true
[49:46] like
[49:48] um outcome of all this we'll see in the
[49:51] next cycle. That will be like the
[49:53] undercurrent lifting the next cycle and
[49:56] we'll be talking about a whole new set
[49:58] of things that are exciting to us. But
[50:00] the undercurrent that's really going to
[50:01] drive the next cycle is is probably what
[50:04] we're seeing today.
[50:06] Yeah, it's the those cycles are just
[50:09] crazy when when you always look at the
[50:12] end of a cycle what happened the whole
[50:14] cycle like kind of unbelievable what
[50:17] what just happened. Um really really
[50:19] cool. We have one question that I ask
[50:22] each and every one of my guests and the
[50:23] question is what can we learn from you
[50:25] besides Bitcoin that I guess if if you
[50:29] make mistakes you get
[50:30] smarter like don't be afraid of screwing
[50:33] things up. It sucks, but pain is a is a
[50:37] motivation to get better. Um, so I think
[50:40] that's that's what I've learned through
[50:41] my life, right? You you bang your head
[50:43] against the wall enough times,
[50:44] eventually you like maybe I should just
[50:46] go around the wall. It's it's it's a
[50:48] good way. Yeah. Like trying out a lot of
[50:50] things and then learning from the
[50:51] feedback you get. That's the only way of
[50:56] how to learn properly. Even if you learn
[50:59] from other people, uh that that might be
[51:01] a good way also. But uh nothing beats
[51:03] your own experience, right? Yeah. No, my
[51:06] my son has got a great ability to learn
[51:08] from other people's mistakes. I was not
[51:11] born with that ability. I got to do it
[51:13] myself. Yeah, me
[51:14] neither. Uh really cool. Thank you so
[51:17] much. Um we have in the podcast we had a
[51:20] previous guest is asking a question for
[51:21] the next guest without knowing who the
[51:23] next guest actually is. And the previous
[51:25] guest ask you the question. We you you
[51:28] kind of already teased it a little bit.
[51:30] Uh but how do you define a Bitcoin
[51:33] standard? Okay. Uh for for me, a Bitcoin
[51:36] standard is a full store value, medium
[51:39] of account or unit of account, medium of
[51:41] exchange, like full adoption. It's the
[51:44] entire globe on the Bitcoin network. To
[51:47] me, that's the Bitcoin standard. And um
[51:51] so that's a journey. It's not a a flash
[51:54] point. And it's going to it's going to
[51:57] take a long time, but we have a protocol
[51:59] that can last thousands and thousands of
[52:01] years. So, I think we're going to get
[52:03] there. Do you think or are isn't a
[52:07] Bitcoin standard world
[52:09] other government or other tokens
[52:13] allowed? Like, is is it a world where
[52:15] there's financial singularity, whereas
[52:17] only Bitcoin or is Bitcoin just a
[52:20] dominant in each category? Um I I see it
[52:23] as the just in terms of money as the
[52:27] store value medium of exchange unit of
[52:29] account. So it's it's what it's the it's
[52:32] what everything is priced in. It's what
[52:34] everything uh is stored in. That doesn't
[52:37] mean that you don't have a token for
[52:39] identity or you don't have a a token
[52:42] that represents your ownership of real
[52:45] estate or the title to a car. Like there
[52:47] could be other tokens but the value of
[52:50] every token or the value of everything
[52:53] would be priced in Bitcoin. That's a
[52:54] world I want to live in Bitcoin as well.
[52:56] Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much Paul
[52:58] for for for being on. Before I let you
[53:00] go, where can people find you, ask you
[53:02] questions and and reach out to you?
[53:04] Sure. I'm I'm on X at
[53:07] humble_hodle
[53:09] 1111 and u otherwise you can go to
[53:13] bitefederal.com and see the company
[53:16] there and uh uh you can you could reach
[53:19] out to me either through the company or
[53:22] through X my you know I'll I'll take a
[53:24] message. So thank you so much Paul. Also
[53:26] thank you so much for everyone that is
[53:28] watching and listening for joining us
[53:29] today. As always I'll be back tomorrow
[53:31] with another episode. Bye-bye.
