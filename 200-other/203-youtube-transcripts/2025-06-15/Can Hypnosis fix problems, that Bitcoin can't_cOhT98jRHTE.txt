[00:00] we are so framed to something negative
[00:02] when it comes to hypnosis we um helped
[00:04] him with hypnosis to get rid of um the
[00:07] sneezers hypnosis can only do what you
[00:09] want hypnosis to do and what you open up
[00:11] for and the problem with stress is that
[00:14] stress is not helpful if you want to
[00:16] tackle problems or challenges and
[00:19] therefore we use hypnosis in order to
[00:21] support people to solve their problems
[00:23] by getting into the right state for
[00:25] problem solving and into the right state
[00:27] for learning changing and growing yeah I
[00:30] do uh self hypnosis every evening before
[00:33] I go to sleep hypnosis Works definitely
[00:36] for kids to fall asleep I would like to
[00:39] change your final routine of the podcast
[00:42] just in this very special episode a tiny
[00:44] bit by um having an invitation for you
[00:47] uh to Just Close Your Eyes for a
[00:50] [Music]
[00:53] minute I can assure you both that we
[00:56] never talked about that on the podcast I
[00:59] think that even the word hypnosis was
[01:01] one of the few words that never came to
[01:05] uh to the podcast uh it's really
[01:06] interesting for me um but because like
[01:10] you're my 163rd podcast and I covered a
[01:14] wide range of topics like with sports
[01:16] with mindset with with even Health with
[01:19] food uh with so many different topics
[01:22] outside of Bitcoin of course like all
[01:24] the Bitcoin topics we also covered uh
[01:26] but this is an area where I'm like
[01:28] excited because it's something new and I
[01:29] always like when there's something new
[01:32] on the table and there's something
[01:33] exciting uh going on so and uh I think
[01:37] most people still have this uh picture
[01:40] in the mind like oh hypnosis is like
[01:41] this stage hypnosis where someone is
[01:43] like flat and and like this kind of
[01:46] hypnosis I don't know if you also do
[01:47] that uh but which is more interesting
[01:50] for me is like you also actually do
[01:52] hypnosis uh for healing people for
[01:55] helping them uh and this is the thing
[01:57] that I'm actually interested in and I'm
[01:59] actually I'm way more uh passionate
[02:03] about because stage hypnosis is like a
[02:05] fun thing entertaining but nothing
[02:07] really that excites me except when it's
[02:10] funny to see um so uh maybe let's start
[02:13] with Andreas uh what is that and and and
[02:16] and why are you you doing that it's
[02:18] basically the principle of hypnosis it's
[02:22] we make use of the nervous system in the
[02:24] human body there's uh two main systems
[02:28] one is to be excited with energy and it
[02:33] makes you move and run very fast and
[02:36] there's the other system which can help
[02:38] you to relax and it's the cooperation of
[02:41] those two systems um which makes our
[02:45] everyday life basically but from the
[02:48] Fiat life and Fiat mindset usually we
[02:51] are way too stressed to have a good and
[02:54] relaxed life and the problem with stress
[02:58] is that stress is not helpful if you
[03:00] want to tackle problems or
[03:03] challenges um and therefore we use
[03:05] hypnosis in order to support people to
[03:08] solve their problems by getting into the
[03:10] right state for problem solving and into
[03:13] the right state for learning changing
[03:15] and
[03:20] growing maybe um uh in order to
[03:24] understand better what it is uh it's
[03:25] also interesting to know what hypnosis
[03:28] not is because I think a lot of people
[03:30] have superstitions about it have a a
[03:34] picture about it what hypnosis it and
[03:36] what not hypnosis not is because we we
[03:38] see a lot of things especially with
[03:40] social media especially with the stress
[03:42] and hectic world that that we see each
[03:44] day and there's like oh we see 10
[03:46] seconds video of something and all of
[03:48] the sudden we have our opinion on that
[03:50] um what is hypnosis not like what what
[03:52] is is not for yeah the the thing is that
[03:55] um it starts super early like uh even in
[04:00] stories for children like on Audi books
[04:03] or books for children always like uh
[04:05] often the bad guy is using hypnosis to
[04:09] make somebody do or feel whatever he or
[04:12] she would like to and um I think we're
[04:15] so frame to something negative when it
[04:17] comes to hypnosis and at the same time
[04:20] we're so openminded and listening to
[04:22] everything that is said and
[04:23] advertisements and uh all the jingles
[04:26] that we hear every day and so open and
[04:30] without any you know um protection
[04:34] against against that like uh singing
[04:36] some jingles and having that all day in
[04:39] mind which is also a kind of hypnosis
[04:42] that is used to make you buy the new
[04:45] iPhone or the newest whatsoever so um
[04:48] actually hypnosis is a tool a little bit
[04:51] like a a knife and you can use it for
[04:54] very good things and you can use it like
[04:56] for not so good things but uh the the
[05:01] thing is that it can only do whatever
[05:04] you like are open up to so for example
[05:08] you talked in the beginning like on
[05:09] stage hypnosis and all of that is only
[05:12] working if people really would like to
[05:15] place the chicken or play the whatever
[05:17] on stage if they don't want to do that
[05:20] it wouldn't work so hypnosis can only do
[05:23] what you want hypnosis to do and what
[05:25] you open up for so actually if if
[05:28] there's any negative impact is something
[05:30] that you are open for and you want for
[05:33] like so my uh small midr ad in the
[05:37] middle of the podcast with with bitbox
[05:39] is is even a form of hypnosis because
[05:42] I'm doing the same thing over and over
[05:44] and try to get people to to buy a new
[05:46] bit box or is it like
[05:50] uh would that be a
[05:54] stretch no no you're spot on you're spot
[05:57] on it no no no that that's that's
[06:00] exactly the point it is hypnosis and it
[06:02] works for the people who are interested
[06:05] in having a good Hardware device which
[06:08] is open source and supported by the
[06:12] community no um yeah it works for the
[06:14] people who are open on this channel who
[06:17] want to know about this and it won't
[06:20] work for somebody who just got himself a
[06:23] seat signer or Jade boox like whoever
[06:25] thinks no this is this need is already
[06:28] satisfied they will be not as suc
[06:31] successible or accessible to your to
[06:34] your
[06:38] advertisement is there um this was the
[06:41] question that actually came up to my
[06:42] mind when I prepared for the question
[06:44] for the uh session today um what's the
[06:47] difference between a guided meditation
[06:51] and hypnosis because guided meditation
[06:53] for me is also like you go uh um relaxed
[06:56] you go deeper and you try to like also
[06:59] find your inner peace and find maybe
[07:01] something that's that's wrong with you
[07:03] um what is there like what is the
[07:05] difference between those
[07:09] two so I would say that the guided
[07:12] meditation is um is more open and it
[07:16] leaves more room for you whereas the
[07:18] guided hypnosis with us is more to to is
[07:23] more usable for problem solving or to to
[07:26] reach a certain goal whereas a a guided
[07:29] meditation will always have Open results
[07:33] um we are planning the results with our
[07:36] clients together to come to certain
[07:38] conclusions or to come to new ideas in a
[07:41] in a certain way so um I would say our
[07:45] approach is more like um more like a
[07:49] system and not as
[07:52] open yeah I love that and and this was
[07:54] is ties back to to what you said in the
[07:56] earlier because when you have uh
[07:59] hypnosis only works with people that
[08:01] actually want to do it uh and when you
[08:03] before set goals and set what you
[08:06] actually want to accomplish with that uh
[08:08] it probably makes it easier and makes it
[08:10] a better results for for both of them um
[08:13] really cool uh is is that also um do you
[08:17] only um do stuff for overcoming problems
[08:20] and anxieties and addictions and and
[08:22] those kind of stuff and then I think
[08:23] everyone has some addictions I think
[08:25] everyone has has addictions some have
[08:28] really bad addictions and have like
[08:29] small addictions uh so there's like
[08:32] levels to it but uh even above that can
[08:36] can hypnosis enhance uh
[08:40] stuff definitely like it's for you to
[08:43] decide how to use a tool do you want
[08:46] more some from something like more
[08:48] self-confidence um maybe more happiness
[08:52] um do you want to be more calm do you
[08:54] want to have a better sleep there are so
[08:57] many things we we could do and we could
[09:00] reach with hypnosis so it can be it can
[09:03] go in two directions it could be less
[09:06] from something or more from
[09:09] something I saw that uh you did an
[09:12] experiment with uh Daniel Prince I think
[09:15] he he shared a little bit about that on
[09:17] on the podcast I unfortunately did not
[09:19] get to to listen to it I I still have to
[09:22] do it I just saw uh the the how can you
[09:26] say it transcript of it um can you share
[09:29] a little bit of of of uh as as as much
[09:32] as Daniel and and he wants to share from
[09:35] it but uh some of his experience and
[09:38] then how how he help how you helped
[09:50] him yeah definitely so um and usually we
[09:54] don't talk about like specific problems
[09:57] of our clients but uh as then already
[10:00] said it by himself in the podcast we're
[10:02] happy to just reiterate reiterate what
[10:05] he said so um basically Daniel had
[10:08] really strong hay fever and he was
[10:11] sneezing um like maybe one maybe 100
[10:16] times a day so to a point where it was
[10:18] really exhausting uh for him and uh then
[10:21] we met in pling uh you could say by
[10:25] chance but maybe there are not so many
[10:28] chances like uh maybe there's a reason
[10:30] for everything uh and we met him and he
[10:33] asked us uh out of curiosity if we could
[10:36] help him and then we um helped him with
[10:38] hypnosis to get rid of um the sneezes
[10:41] and in the following days he was
[10:43] sneezing like um once per day and only
[10:47] once so there was a reduction of sneezes
[10:50] by like 99% which was very beneficial
[10:53] for him um and also we didn't want to
[10:56] remove his ability to sneeze like
[10:59] entirely because sneezing is also very
[11:02] healthy for the body if it happens like
[11:04] on a not too frequent um term basically
[11:08] and then he returned home the sneezing
[11:10] came back but um then we had another
[11:14] session and the sneezing has been done
[11:16] ever since so um that's why he was so
[11:19] impressed to have the podcast with us
[11:22] because uh he didn't think that was
[11:25] possible before basically without taking
[11:28] drugs or medicine H I love it a lot that
[11:31] uh that you can you could have helped
[11:33] him and and you actually do that you
[11:35] also do everything on a value for Value
[11:37] basis as I understood it uh I think from
[11:39] our last conversation which is uh really
[11:42] interesting that we don't set a price we
[11:45] we do it and then we see how much uh it
[11:48] was worth do you have a good uh
[11:50] experience with that and and why did you
[11:52] decide to to do it with with that kind
[11:54] of a
[11:55] model the thing is that um who are we to
[11:59] say if the customer or the client who
[12:02] comes to us was satisfied or not so only
[12:05] the person who who felt the difference
[12:09] afterwards can say if it was like what
[12:13] he or she wanted to have or not and um
[12:16] so it's better that this person can take
[12:19] the decision what like how high the
[12:21] value is of the
[12:26] session I love it is it
[12:29] um what I'm always interested in because
[12:32] I'm fascinating by people actually
[12:35] listen to my podcast and actually do uh
[12:38] see the podcast for free and then they
[12:40] go ahead and see like oh I got really a
[12:42] lot of value out of the podcast and then
[12:44] they go ahead and actually just send
[12:46] something like they already got it they
[12:49] have no obligation to do it there's no
[12:51] personal connection like with you there
[12:53] is even a personal connection so there's
[12:54] like um a little bit more of the feeling
[12:57] of an obligation a little bit more
[13:00] um but even with people that have
[13:01] absolutely no obligation because I don't
[13:03] even know them I could even see know if
[13:06] I see them on the street I would not
[13:07] know if they would watch the episode or
[13:09] not they still give something and uh the
[13:13] the concept of value for value is is is
[13:15] for me a really fascinating one and I
[13:18] don't know how how much it is
[13:20] contributed to the Bitcoin uh but it
[13:23] seems like really popular in the Bitcoin
[13:25] Community uh is that something that uh
[13:28] you think will will be um more
[13:31] mainstream when we come more to a
[13:33] Bitcoin standard uh or is it something
[13:36] that just comes up as a small Niche
[13:39] thing or is it actually uh could could
[13:41] the world be actually so uh developed
[13:44] that we come to a world where like I
[13:46] don't know 40 or 30% of uh the prices
[13:49] are set by the
[13:54] customer so what I think is the best
[13:58] about value for value is the time
[14:00] preference uh which means that if we
[14:02] want to have a stable business or a
[14:05] stable exchange the value for Value will
[14:09] always tend to be beneficial for both
[14:12] sides so the party who gives the value
[14:15] is never giving more than they perceive
[14:18] it uh as valuable and the other party um
[14:21] yet I I like that the customer sets the
[14:24] price um because I
[14:27] um I could after a while refuse people
[14:30] to offer my service to them if they
[14:33] always think oh like the price is too
[14:35] low and I set a lower price to have to
[14:38] to make the transaction more beneficial
[14:41] um for myself so with a selfish um
[14:44] attitude I think the the model will not
[14:47] work but with a selfish attitude you
[14:49] also will not have long-term uh
[14:51] relationships and business relationships
[14:54] and with the value for Value model every
[14:56] party is incentivized to to um to
[15:00] cooperate again and this is what gives
[15:02] like long-term Bond bondings and
[15:05] long-term value to this
[15:08] model yeah and and I think um what's the
[15:13] basis on like why people don't believe
[15:18] like mostly people don't believe that
[15:19] this works is only negative belief we
[15:23] have in the current system like um many
[15:26] many negative beliefs that people are
[15:28] suffering from current ly and I think
[15:30] Bitcoin helps them to to overcome that
[15:33] slowly but um like when when I like I'm
[15:36] also giving meditation classes here like
[15:40] locally with like no coiners or no
[15:44] bitcoiners and people told me in the
[15:46] beginning you can't do that value for
[15:48] Value it wouldn't work like people will
[15:49] not pay you and actually they do and it
[15:53] works so it's it's something I think we
[15:57] we could we could do like everybody
[15:59] could benefit from that it's just our
[16:01] negative belief um that we were told
[16:04] that people are bad that people are
[16:06] selfish that people are egoist and egist
[16:09] in a in a bad way and so it can't it
[16:12] can't be you know people can be this way
[16:15] it can't be positive no way so um it's
[16:19] super interesting like when you when you
[16:21] think about negative beliefs that we got
[16:24] through school through films through
[16:26] family um it's it's incredible you talk
[16:30] to people and you you see it right away
[16:32] like they throw their NE their negative
[16:34] beliefs on you uh no um free market free
[16:37] market would that would only be for like
[16:39] rich people it would make rich people
[16:41] richer richer companies richer and uh it
[16:44] will create monopolies and you know all
[16:47] those negative beliefs that they learned
[16:50] every day and their whole life that they
[16:52] were breathing in that air they I say
[16:55] they but it's actually we because like
[16:56] we're all part of this of the system and
[16:59] even if it might change now you know
[17:01] there are so many things we have so
[17:04] deeply in us that sometimes uh it just
[17:06] pops up and you think okay whoa where
[17:09] does this come from and then you realize
[17:12] okay this is what I actually learned in
[17:13] school or what friends told me or what
[17:16] everybody every everybody like something
[17:19] you hear here often in France is you
[17:21] can't do
[17:22] that because if everybody would do that
[17:26] then the whole system would break up you
[17:28] know it it would destroy the whole
[17:30] system so it's crazy how how like how
[17:34] people are afraid that something could
[17:35] break the existing system very
[17:41] interesting yeah and it's interesting
[17:44] for me um I I have an I have an Indian
[17:46] girlfriend uh and and and she she made
[17:50] that experiment that in my small town
[17:53] where I lift up like there not a lot of
[17:55] people it's like a little bit far off a
[17:57] city you need from my house to the next
[18:00] bus station three kilometers so it's a
[18:03] long way drive to you have to have a car
[18:05] it's just with public transport not
[18:07] possible and it's a really trusting uh
[18:11] Society there uh and for example we have
[18:14] small farmers who put their products out
[18:17] in a shelf and just um uh um I forgot
[18:22] the English word for it just a CA
[18:25] something where you can put the the cash
[18:26] in price yourself like there there are
[18:29] price tags to to all the uh products but
[18:35] basically you can get there and put the
[18:37] whole fridge in yourself don't pay for
[18:39] anything and maybe even take the money
[18:41] with it like it's not secure there are
[18:43] no cameras there's nothing it's just a a
[18:46] really trusting society and she said to
[18:49] me that would be empty in India in like
[18:52] two minutes uh and it was really
[18:54] interesting for me because I also
[18:55] thought about um how a good monetary
[18:59] system might change uh people behaviors
[19:03] when we have sound money and we have uh
[19:06] a base layer that everyone can trust and
[19:09] people don't have the feeling that they
[19:11] have been stolen from from the central
[19:13] banks and everything like that um it
[19:16] actually is possible that we live in a
[19:18] more um loving and caring uh and not as
[19:22] stressful of a world uh and we can see
[19:25] that a little bit with Swiss I feel like
[19:27] the Swiss people are way more relaxed
[19:29] and way more uh um yeah way better in in
[19:34] that than other people uh when we have
[19:36] like in India for example I always see a
[19:39] story from my girlfriend I Was Myself
[19:41] never there but she's like it's a lot of
[19:43] stress you go there it's noisy a lot of
[19:46] people it's a come and go uh and so I
[19:48] think uh money actually has a big
[19:51] influence in our incentive system and
[19:52] has a big influence in how we behave
[19:56] with one each other
[20:01] yeah definitely and what I would like to
[20:03] add is that um like hyperbitcoinization
[20:07] is not done yet we know every Satoshi
[20:10] will gain even more and more value um
[20:13] over time but already with the um with
[20:18] the Bitcoin I I am able to enjoy the
[20:21] richness of life already like I I might
[20:25] not enjoy the final purchasing power but
[20:28] I have time to enjoy the life as it is
[20:32] currently and there's a feeling of
[20:34] wealth already because I'm not as
[20:37] worried about the future and I don't
[20:40] think things get worse but they get even
[20:42] better so I'm relaxed in the here and
[20:44] now I can focus in the here and now and
[20:47] what I would like to add for the value
[20:49] for Value model is that in the value for
[20:52] Value even the PLS surprised me um in
[20:57] what value they see in um our service
[21:00] because they paid more than I would have
[21:03] expected in my dreams basically so I
[21:06] felt almost overpaid I I felt like wow
[21:09] this is like incredible that in a short
[21:13] amount of time I can offer so much um to
[21:16] the people and this is why we will also
[21:19] do more marketing now because we get the
[21:22] feedback from the PLS that there is
[21:24] value in our work and uh so let's bring
[21:27] it to the market let's increase the
[21:29] value for
[21:30] everyone why did you decide uh I mean
[21:33] obviously there's something that you can
[21:35] do with all kinds of uh uh um markets
[21:40] and and I feel like even bitcoiners are
[21:44] way more healthier and have a way better
[21:47] um feeling to each other than uh the
[21:51] average guy has um why did you choose to
[21:54] be in Bitcoin and in the Bitcoin
[21:56] Community with with yeah something that
[21:58] you can basically do with with every
[22:00] person he doesn't have to have Bitcoin
[22:02] for
[22:07] that that's true but um at the same time
[22:10] we made the experience that in
[22:13] Fiat basically in Fiat we lack the
[22:16] studies from important and re well-known
[22:19] universities to prove that the concept
[22:22] is working because we are working on a
[22:25] subjective and individual level so we
[22:27] don't have high class studies peer
[22:31] reviewed double triple quadruple times
[22:35] to prove that our concept is working and
[22:37] we're not even willing to invest the
[22:39] money to have those studies done and in
[22:42] the Bitcoin space people tend to um to
[22:45] verify forsel what works and what
[22:48] doesn't work and with the value for
[22:49] Value they don't even have any risk um
[22:53] in in the model so um just the business
[22:55] works better in the Bitcoin space and at
[22:58] the same time to support our fellow PLS
[23:01] is I think the best we can do because
[23:03] this strengthens the ecosystem and it's
[23:06] helpful for and beneficial for everyone
[23:09] of us yeah but we also offer service in
[23:12] Fiat but in Fiat we don't offer it value
[23:15] for Value we have fixed terms and
[23:17] conditions because in Fiat everything
[23:19] needs to be
[23:22] fixed so even you make an uh
[23:25] differentiation if someone pays uh in in
[23:28] Bitcoin and someone pays in fat this is
[23:30] really interesting to
[23:34] hear yeah what I wanted to add is like
[23:37] um if there is a if someone uh wants to
[23:42] uh convince me of something and they
[23:44] then saying oh there's this study and
[23:47] this is that this always makes me really
[23:49] really really careful like if if someone
[23:51] goes ahead and explain something with a
[23:53] study has done I'm really careful
[23:56] because I know all of the studies
[23:58] someone has to pay for and that someone
[24:00] has had an incentive for some outcome of
[24:02] the study I'm not saying every study is
[24:05] uh is manipulated but I'm just saying
[24:08] that studies um have an Financial
[24:12] incentive usually like if I have a
[24:14] product and I want to prove something I
[24:16] can uh give a study in in uh in order
[24:20] and they can prove my point I might be
[24:23] right about the point and just want to
[24:24] have the study done uh in a in a good
[24:27] way but maybe I also say like oh this
[24:30] this is the outcome of the study and if
[24:32] this is not the outcome of the study I
[24:34] will not publish it uh please I want to
[24:36] have something published or there's like
[24:37] this abstract thing um when we saw like
[24:41] oh there's like 20,000 different
[24:44] abstracts but then only I don't know
[24:47] 5,000 of them made it do the final thing
[24:49] and then they're saying like ah 97 uh
[24:53] percent of all scientists said this is
[24:56] correct but they left out uh 75% of all
[25:00] scien is in all opinions it's it's uh I
[25:03] hope we come back to the world where we
[25:05] actually just uh go in deeper and go in
[25:10] uh trusting ourselves and verifying
[25:12] ourselves and being in self-control
[25:15] about uh researching and about marketing
[25:18] and yeah as as we tied it back also
[25:20] before when when marketing is hypnosis
[25:23] and we have to be more critical thinkers
[25:25] and and think like oh is that is that
[25:27] actually uh something I want to buy or
[25:30] do I just buy it because they put uh
[25:33] 20,000 ads on me the last
[25:37] year yeah yeah and what what I wanted to
[25:41] add to um why why Bitcoin is why PLS um
[25:46] I have the feeling that currently like a
[25:48] lot of things are changing in this world
[25:50] and that Bitcoin is like uh has a huge
[25:53] impact on that and is like a base layer
[25:56] for those changes and um
[25:58] if we consider ourself as the social
[26:00] layer of those changes it would be
[26:03] really nice if we could get rid of all
[26:06] those like this fear dust we have on us
[26:09] currently like all those beliefs we were
[26:12] talking about earlier like there even
[26:15] even for people who are in
[26:17] Bitcoin I I can imagine that they still
[26:20] have some you know deep inside
[26:22] themselves some Fiat beliefs that are
[26:25] still there something like um
[26:29] I have to be this and that way to be
[26:31] beautiful or um I have to do this and
[26:34] that to be loved or I cannot love myself
[26:37] because uh self-loving is egoistic are
[26:41] some of those uh things we we hear and
[26:43] um we learned so uh plus still like even
[26:48] if you are a Bitcoin it might be that
[26:50] you are in a in a family where you have
[26:52] to convince everybody to you know that
[26:55] you have always be
[26:57] to you know to be maybe feel a bit
[27:00] lonely in your closer surroundings and
[27:02] so it's it's really good to have some
[27:04] some tools to strengthen yourself and to
[27:07] protect yourself from yeah those
[27:11] negative beliefs that are somehow thrown
[27:12] on you or like uh you're confronted with
[27:15] all the time so yeah strength strength
[27:18] the community is a is a good a good task
[27:24] actually and I um I started that and I'm
[27:28] not consistent with that uh but for me I
[27:32] had a problem with like just sitting
[27:33] down and relaxing and have meditation I
[27:36] know the the benefits of that uh I got
[27:39] to now do it when I walk I can like walk
[27:43] an hour without headphones without
[27:45] podcast without music without that and
[27:48] this is the time where I'm like really
[27:50] I'm just for me because the the the time
[27:52] when I'm uh on my computer and phone
[27:55] it's it's this days like there's a lot
[27:57] coming in especially if you have um a
[28:00] little bit more viral videos like the
[28:02] Michael Sailor One there all of a sudden
[28:05] 50 people in your DMs that want to do
[28:07] something they want to be on a podcast
[28:09] they want to sponsor the podcast they
[28:10] want to do something like there a lot of
[28:12] things and Impressions coming in uh and
[28:15] what I found is like everyone has to
[28:18] find his his way of finding uh calmness
[28:22] because it's okay if if sometimes it's a
[28:24] little more stresser sometimes there's a
[28:26] little bit more of of inputs coming in
[28:29] then then you actually could handle uh
[28:32] this is also
[28:34] something I don't know I seen the bitco
[28:37] uh World sometimes also this maybe
[28:39] that's not the the the most popular
[28:41] opinion that I have right now but um
[28:44] when we are in the Bitcoin world uh and
[28:46] people say like oh but you have to have
[28:48] a low time Preference they take this
[28:50] thing of a low time preference sometimes
[28:53] as an excuse to not work and be lazy and
[28:57] it's okay to be lazy it's okay to be
[29:00] relaxed sometimes but I feel like I I
[29:03] sometimes I have the feeling oh yes I I
[29:06] take a low time preference and now I
[29:08] watch four hours of Netflix and and
[29:11] don't get me wrong like sometimes it's
[29:12] okay to relax sometimes it's okay to to
[29:14] watch four hours of Netflix but if you
[29:16] do it every day your time prefer is
[29:18] actually not low it's actually High
[29:21] because you value your time right now
[29:23] and if you instead would work out do
[29:25] something productive or something else
[29:27] you could actually lower your time with
[29:30] that and work for your future self more
[29:33] so I that's that's kind of my my
[29:35] thoughts that came to mind when when we
[29:37] when we talked about that um yeah but
[29:40] before we get in other things I I wanted
[29:42] to get to know how how you both actually
[29:45] found your way in Bitcoin uh yeah maybe
[29:48] start with
[29:50] Marie yeah actually my way to bitcoin is
[29:53] sitting to your right or to your left I
[29:55] don't know from which perspective you
[29:57] see it but um yeah so um I heard about
[30:02] it and um already during my studies like
[30:05] in uh 2009 already but um it was so far
[30:10] away and I didn't understand anything
[30:11] for me it was like okay something really
[30:14] obscure and like strange and I didn't
[30:17] get it and it seems to be like only for
[30:20] yeah people being totally interned from
[30:22] Medics and stuff and so I ignored it for
[30:24] a long time again and then um like 10
[30:27] years later um Andreas showed up again
[30:29] with this uh subject like okay you have
[30:32] to study that and you really have to
[30:34] study that and look at that and maybe uh
[30:36] maybe you can watch the human voku
[30:38] together and you can understand that
[30:40] it's not only for like really crazy
[30:43] people but for people like you and me
[30:45] and so we watched this and um I was like
[30:47] okay crazy and then um I really liked um
[30:51] like the Bitcoin which is um a German
[30:55] podcast um from appic media which really
[30:58] really nice where actually articles from
[31:01] like very different sources are
[31:02] translated and so I I like listen to it
[31:05] during like when I drove my car and when
[31:07] I had time to do that and it's so so
[31:10] interesting everything I learned M like
[31:13] it feels so so totally right like for
[31:15] the first time you listen to something
[31:17] and it's like wow it's so beautiful
[31:20] people thought it through they really
[31:22] thought it through okay maybe maybe this
[31:25] couldn't work or this like this could be
[31:27] an issue and then you you come to
[31:28] another source explaining everything in
[31:30] detail and you're like cool even this
[31:34] aspect was saw true and so it's it's so
[31:37] heartwarming actually for me to see
[31:39] something that was made with so much
[31:41] love and so many good intents and so
[31:45] much I don't know like the the first
[31:47] time we met afterwards uh and and me I
[31:49] felt like I was like walking on clouds
[31:52] you know it felt so whoa this is really
[31:54] something that would change society uh
[31:57] especially when um like you had the
[31:59] feeling long time ago that um everything
[32:02] goes wrong somehow in the society and
[32:04] suddenly there is something you can
[32:06] build on and you can you know trust on
[32:10] even if we don't trust and we verify but
[32:11] when you verify you realize you can
[32:13] trust so it's like really really nice
[32:16] really good good good feeling but
[32:18] brought me into a big uh orange bubble
[32:21] that I really
[32:22] like thank you you already made it
[32:25] halfway through the video and I'm really
[32:27] really grateful to have you here two
[32:29] things make this channel possible you as
[32:32] a watcher and listener who keep
[32:33] supporting this Channel and another one
[32:36] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[32:38] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[32:41] from the very start and where I
[32:43] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[32:45] Robin you even get a discount when you
[32:47] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[32:49] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[32:52] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[32:55] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[32:57] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[33:00] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[33:02] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[33:06] bracket and if you have self custody and
[33:08] you know your friend does not have maybe
[33:09] he needs a Christmas present maybe he
[33:11] needs a birthday present and a small
[33:13] life if you use code Robin you get 5%
[33:16] off your order plus you support my
[33:19] channel and now let's get back to the
[33:22] video I I sometimes feel like if it's if
[33:25] it's only us because we're early or if
[33:29] it actually could have a long-term
[33:31] impact on on society and I think later
[33:34] is the is the case so we we actually
[33:36] have a a long-term impact positive
[33:39] impact when we we change out the
[33:41] fundament of of of of our money Andreas
[33:44] how was it for
[33:48] you yeah so um I I was aware of Bitcoin
[33:55] since
[33:56] 2014 but uh
[33:58] I it took me almost seven years to
[34:01] really understand and to have this final
[34:03] moment where everything came together
[34:05] and um I remember in the human beu when
[34:09] um I watched it and giggy said well only
[34:12] the crazy people think that Bitcoin is a
[34:14] safe bet and I belong to those crazy
[34:17] people and I thought oh yeah and now I
[34:19] do
[34:21] too and I was reading the B the Bitcoin
[34:24] standard in two and a half days and I
[34:26] was listening to the the first 20
[34:28] episodes of the 21 um podcast um at the
[34:32] same time so this was really an intense
[34:35] uh experience to fall down the the
[34:38] rabbit hole but um yeah I didn't want to
[34:41] exit ever since it goes on and on and on
[34:43] and I love it because it uh yeah it
[34:46] brings back purpose in life and goals
[34:49] and actual means um of achieving
[34:52] something do you think we still are are
[34:54] crazy
[34:59] I think it's good but in a good way
[35:00] crazy
[35:04] yeah I also think that the crazy is good
[35:08] and also
[35:09] it's yeah the thing is that sometimes
[35:12] people pretend to be normal and what's
[35:15] normal ah sorry yeah it's you know and
[35:19] uh I I don't like this when when people
[35:23] start to say okay this has to be like
[35:25] that and this is normal and it's not
[35:27] normal that this is like that that's
[35:29] such a strange kind like of
[35:31] argumentation and um often I hear from
[35:34] people like even before Bitcoin that I
[35:36] was like crazy so I totally accept that
[35:38] it's okay it's fine fits
[35:43] good please also Andreas I think I I un
[35:47] I think we we have a little lag in there
[35:49] and after the podcast it will not be in
[35:50] there so let's see how how it will be
[35:53] for for the viewers uh so I think that I
[35:55] because of the lag I interrupted you
[36:02] no no worries no what I also wanted to
[36:04] say it depends on the definition um of
[36:07] crazy so if an architect goes into an
[36:10] empty building and he sees how it will
[36:13] be and how everything will look like or
[36:15] maybe he's just drawing it uh on the
[36:17] paper you could also claim that he's
[36:19] crazy because he's seeing and imagining
[36:23] things that are not right there this
[36:25] very moment but it doesn't mean that
[36:27] those things won't be there in the near
[36:30] or long-term future so I think um if we
[36:33] say we're not crazy but very creative
[36:36] then it's a perfectly good trade to
[36:42] have uh there's this amazing uh um quote
[36:47] from Einstein uh he said like insanity
[36:49] is doing the same thing over and over
[36:51] expecting different results uh this also
[36:54] reminds me of of of of crazy like we we
[36:56] want like everyone in the financial
[36:59] system knows that the money somehow is
[37:03] bad like depend no no matter in which
[37:06] political Camp no matter in what camp
[37:08] you are in everyone kind of agrees the
[37:11] system we having
[37:13] now is wrong they are putting the the
[37:17] the guilt of that on different people
[37:20] they're putting the the the uh the
[37:23] theault of that on different
[37:25] institutions but everyone kind of agrees
[37:27] like there is something wrong with it
[37:29] and but still everyone is like oh no
[37:31] it's working we should not change too
[37:33] much it's it's diff like it like it
[37:35] would be too difficult and it would be
[37:38] too risky to like have some new
[37:40] Financial system like Bitcoin then it's
[37:42] like okay you you recognize that there's
[37:44] something wrong but you don't want to do
[37:47] anything else so you want different
[37:48] results with doing the same thing over
[37:50] and over so I think actually we are not
[37:53] the crazy people we we are the people
[37:56] just that think critical and actually
[37:58] think for ourself and this is something
[38:01] that's just not uh what the average
[38:04] person does not do so it's not normal in
[38:06] a sense of like I think normal most
[38:09] people when they say normal they meant
[38:12] to say the average guy or girl is doing
[38:15] that and if we talking about the average
[38:18] guy girl that's that's fine but that's
[38:20] not normal like that just because
[38:21] everyone does it uh it's it's not
[38:24] something uh good my mom always used to
[38:26] say uh
[38:28] if everyone jumps from the bridge will
[38:29] you also jump from the bridge Robin and
[38:31] because I had this argument oh but
[38:32] everyone did it and so like that's
[38:36] that's how how I see it and insanity is
[38:38] is is something that uh most people have
[38:42] because they do the same thing over and
[38:44] over and try like ah I want to have this
[38:46] I want to have this but they're not
[38:47] doing anything for
[38:49] that yeah and you just mentioned uh at
[38:53] least two um aspects that are so so like
[38:58] like things we learned in our in this
[39:01] current system guilt finger pointing um
[39:06] you know all those all those things that
[39:09] maybe we can overcome that at one point
[39:11] because guilt is like leading leading to
[39:14] nothing like how what does it make me to
[39:17] to feel guilty um can I innovate can I
[39:20] change something if I feel guilty no no
[39:24] I'm I'm like U I'm forced to stay like
[39:29] uh in a state of um where where I can't
[39:32] move where I'm you know I'm bound to
[39:35] something and so so guilt is super
[39:38] useless actually and um and and this is
[39:42] but this is something we're always
[39:43] searching for like when you you ask
[39:46] somebody even even a question that is
[39:47] not not really about uh who's like who's
[39:51] fold it was or whatsoever just how can I
[39:53] do this and they're like oh yeah that
[39:55] this is not working is actually not my
[39:57] fault and they're like yeah well this
[39:59] was not at all the point I just wanted
[40:00] to know how it how it could work you
[40:03] know and we we we're so like there's so
[40:06] many reflexes that we have which is okay
[40:08] it's not me I step back I'm first I'm
[40:11] I'm checking around me who can point the
[40:13] finger on and um those those like
[40:16] reflexes is also something I I think as
[40:19] a society we can work on that and we can
[40:22] get rid of that because who cares you
[40:25] know who cares whose fault it was it I
[40:27] mean we we should go forward we should
[40:29] make things better so maybe we should
[40:32] point fingers on who can help and who
[40:34] can innovate and who can make it better
[40:38] uh instead of looking into the
[40:46] past do you think also that uh this is
[40:48] the same thing that you talked about
[40:50] when you talked about the social layer I
[40:52] hear that a lot I never covered it on
[40:54] the podcast actually uh the social layer
[40:56] of Bitcoin there are a lot of aspects to
[40:59] it I talked with Danny in Bitcoin Prague
[41:02] about it that uh bitcoiners are
[41:04] projecting their values onto Bitcoin and
[41:07] then expect that every bitcoiner has
[41:09] those values for example when we come to
[41:11] food there are a lot of carnivores in
[41:12] the Bitcoin community and they're like
[41:13] oh everyone has to eat meat there there
[41:15] cannot be any weans but there are a lot
[41:17] of weans in the Bitcoin Community uh and
[41:20] and it's like just because you only eat
[41:23] meat does not mean that everyone has to
[41:25] eat meat in the Bitcoin community
[41:27] um how do you how do you assess right
[41:29] now the the the social layer of of of
[41:32] Bitcoin and what what is that for
[41:36] you Andreas would you like to
[41:40] start so for me it's the people who
[41:44] having the consent that um there like
[41:48] there's value in the world and we can
[41:50] measure it with Bitcoin that is the
[41:52] content we are agreeing on uh right now
[41:56] and I think all the other aspects are
[41:58] secondary because um everyone has
[42:02] intentions and everybody everyone is
[42:04] acting um in order to achieve whatever
[42:07] they want to achieve and I'm not here to
[42:10] judge um I just think the core value is
[42:13] um we can exchange value and we can help
[42:16] each other and this is the very
[42:18] fundamental thing um for me the aspect
[42:21] of Corporation this is the social layer
[42:24] um of Bitcoin and I don't care how
[42:26] people
[42:27] design their life um despite that but I
[42:31] want to see how I can cooperate with
[42:33] them for more value in the market for a
[42:37] better life for everyone
[42:38] basically yeah beautiful I also I also
[42:42] think that um it's all around value like
[42:45] if if the money that you have has value
[42:48] then you tend to save it and if you
[42:50] realize that your body has value you may
[42:54] want to save it also if you realize that
[42:57] love is a value you can share then maybe
[43:00] this is something you want to save or
[43:02] you want to spread or you want to share
[43:05] you know so um maybe this is a common
[43:09] ground if we we realize what has value
[43:11] and what is like super flu then we can
[43:17] also just
[43:19] have just agree to that and and then it
[43:22] doesn't matter if you think that meat or
[43:26] vegetables or whatsoever ever is good
[43:27] for your body if you care for your body
[43:29] this is the best you can do for the
[43:30] community if you care for yourself it's
[43:32] the best you can do for everybody if you
[43:34] love yourself it's the best you can do
[43:37] because only when you do that you can
[43:39] spread it and only if you have good
[43:41] energy in you you can spread the good
[43:43] energy to everybody so who cares how you
[43:46] get this energy if it's good for you it
[43:49] might be like it's good for
[43:54] others yeah I like the points uh a lot
[43:58] um I have one more question uh that I
[44:01] forgot to ask when we we talked about
[44:03] hypnosis um what do you think of self
[44:07] hypnosis is that a a thing that is is
[44:10] possible because I feel like it's it's
[44:12] like a lot of thing is guided and you
[44:13] have to have a set of goals but this
[44:15] self hypnosis something that's
[44:21] achievable yeah definitely just this
[44:24] morning I um told Marie um I recorded a
[44:29] session with a client um and I was
[44:33] giving suggestions about alleviating arm
[44:36] so it's just like a subconscious signal
[44:39] that something is happening and I was
[44:41] walking outside in the park and I was
[44:43] hearing to my own hypnosis and all of a
[44:46] sudden my arms started levitating and of
[44:49] course I consciously knew why it was
[44:52] happening but still it was like a
[44:54] surprise for me and people look to me as
[44:56] if I'm crazy because my arm was um was
[44:59] lifted up while I was walking uh all all
[45:03] the time but I knew about the the
[45:06] process and it was great and actually I
[45:08] do a self hypnosis every evening before
[45:11] I go to sleep um for like half an hour
[45:14] and you could also call it meditation
[45:17] but it's half an hour of contemplation
[45:20] about my goals My Day My Life um before
[45:24] I then go to sleep basically
[45:27] yeah and I think it also uh helps you to
[45:30] overcome uh legs for example like um
[45:35] imagine you're in a situation you have
[45:37] to talk to people you have to talk to
[45:38] people and you're a little bit nervous
[45:41] and
[45:42] you yeah you you don't know like you you
[45:44] felt a little bit and then suddenly you
[45:46] feel that your voice is like maybe you
[45:50] talk like a raven because you don't have
[45:51] any voice anymore and you're really
[45:53] afraid that okay now I have to talk to
[45:55] many many people and I don't have my
[45:57] voice anymore and then you think about
[46:00] something
[46:02] like you drink honey and milk like warm
[46:07] honey and milk and this is such a cozy
[46:09] feeling and maybe you have some
[46:11] associations with that like sitting at
[46:13] your granny's table or somewhere from a
[46:16] childhood sitting somewhere where you
[46:18] feel good and uh Lov and now you're
[46:21] drinking that and it's such a nice
[46:24] feeling in your in your throat you know
[46:27] when the milk and the Honey goes down
[46:29] your throat and it's like ah giving you
[46:32] such a nice voice and G make you feel so
[46:35] comfy and so nice and then with this
[46:38] good feeling you can go out and talk to
[46:40] people so I think our brain is so
[46:43] complex and we can do so many things and
[46:46] everything that you already felt in the
[46:49] past you can maybe feel it again only
[46:51] when you think about it so maybe you
[46:53] already had a really good massage that
[46:56] was so nice and it was so good and now
[46:58] imagine you just have it right now why
[47:01] not why not thinking that uh at this
[47:04] very moment there's somebody behind me
[47:06] and giving me a really nice massage on
[47:08] my shoulders and
[47:11] suddenly well that feels very good you
[47:14] know I feel relaxed that's good and
[47:16] maybe now um I would like to have this
[47:18] feeling but more intense or less intense
[47:22] or maybe I would want to have this
[47:23] feeling on my shoulders but on my neck
[47:25] or is somebody somewhere else you know
[47:28] and it's just it just feels good and
[47:30] maybe we can do that to ourselves and we
[47:32] can learn how to to do that I mean this
[47:35] is what I meant earlier with with the LA
[47:37] we we apparently there is nobody behind
[47:40] me I mean you have to tell me but I
[47:41] don't think that there's somebody behind
[47:43] me giving me a massage but maybe I can
[47:46] just feel it when I think about it and I
[47:49] want to really feel
[47:50] that you know maybe I confused you not
[47:53] totally that's fine too that's part of
[47:55] the strategy but uh
[47:58] but I think there are many many things
[48:00] that are possible and we can just learn
[48:02] how to do
[48:03] that I just thought about uh the Michael
[48:07] S interview because he has this famous
[48:09] thing that he always does when he goes
[48:11] on a rent he's
[48:13] like this thing and I feel like it's
[48:16] almost
[48:19] like it's it's almost like an uh an
[48:22] trigger for him to like okay I got the
[48:25] question I like now I get going with
[48:27] with with my 30 minutes rant uh and it's
[48:31] uh I just thought about that because I
[48:33] think a lot of people like when they
[48:35] talk about public speakers that are used
[48:37] to speaking a lot they have like their
[48:38] routines like Tony Robinson has this
[48:41] thing where he like jumps up and then
[48:43] turns around like he has this physical
[48:45] thing that he always does in front of
[48:46] the right before he goes on stage and
[48:48] then he goes on with a lot of energy so
[48:51] that that's like uh I really like to
[48:53] have like those those triggers uh and uh
[48:57] I see also that there's a lot of
[48:58] negative triggers in in your life like
[49:01] uh when you're like because I had had
[49:03] that uh uh when I came home and it was a
[49:06] long day uh and and I was feeling too
[49:10] stressed and I could not sleep I always
[49:11] had this feeling like oh I now I eat a
[49:13] lot I had never problem with that
[49:15] because I trained so much so I I was
[49:18] never fat or something like that uh but
[49:21] I still eat a lot and then I could not
[49:22] sleep nice and then at some point I was
[49:25] like oh that's really bad behavior like
[49:27] the the stress coming home late and then
[49:29] eating this this was the trigger for
[49:31] like then eating something and then I
[49:33] actually worked on it okay I come home I
[49:35] don't have this trigger I find something
[49:37] else to do and then I go on and I just I
[49:41] just I did not do it with hypnosis but
[49:43] if hnos would be probably a FAS faster
[49:46] way out of that uh but right now it's
[49:49] like no matter when I come home no
[49:50] matter how stressed I am like I I can
[49:52] really nicely come down relax and then
[49:55] go uh about my and feel really good and
[49:59] I like that uh we have in the Bitcoin
[50:01] space people that want to help each
[50:03] other people that are actually uh there
[50:05] for each other and and I like that that
[50:07] you doing it uh professionally and
[50:10] you're actually helping people because
[50:12] this is also something I put it out now
[50:14] with a podcast uh and maybe someone is
[50:17] in the audience feel like oh I I could I
[50:19] could use some help with with that thing
[50:21] that I have and and this is a thing that
[50:23] I did not try uh and uh this is this is
[50:27] something um we all uh are we all could
[50:32] benefit from when we help each other out
[50:35] and this is the the Bitcoin community in
[50:37] it in itself like we helping each other
[50:39] out all the time um because we are two
[50:43] people now I want to start with the end
[50:45] routine a little bit earlier because we
[50:47] have like always two questions and if I
[50:50] have four answers I have to start a
[50:51] little bit early with the end routine so
[50:53] we get get it in the hour around that
[50:55] time um the endro team uh consists of
[50:58] two uh uh questions the first question
[51:01] is always the same question for every
[51:03] guest and then the last question is from
[51:05] the previous guest a question for for
[51:08] for you both uh and the first question
[51:11] is um what are you currently passionate
[51:13] about besides Bitcoin and helping other
[51:16] bitcoiners so like what are you
[51:18] passionate about besides what we are
[51:20] talked about right now in the podcast is
[51:22] there anything else that you're learning
[51:24] uh or you're passionate about um who
[51:26] wants to go
[51:31] first uh so for me right now it's about
[51:34] becoming more agile again uh which means
[51:37] I'm uh selling off my flat I'm uh making
[51:41] it empty piece by piece and I want to
[51:44] travel again and I want to meet
[51:46] bitcoiners in all over the world and
[51:48] this is something I did a lot in my
[51:51] youth and uh now I want to do it again
[51:53] and I'm very much looking forward to it
[51:57] where you do you have a a target for
[52:03] traveling uh yeah so probably I will
[52:05] start uh the travel of in Thailand where
[52:08] I also have been before and it's a nice
[52:11] place people are really happy there and
[52:14] smiling um yeah looking forward amazing
[52:18] uh tell me when you come by in Vienna
[52:23] someday yeah we do
[52:27] what about you
[52:29] Maria yeah uh for me it's currently um
[52:33] everything that's creative like I really
[52:35] like um painting music like I'm playing
[52:39] the guitar I'm singing and um currently
[52:43] it's like uh writing poems so um I'm I'm
[52:48] walking around having some pieces uh in
[52:50] my head and um yeah I just I just
[52:54] starting to started to put some stuff on
[52:56] on fter but I really like to to play
[52:58] with words and have some friends doing
[53:00] the same and um yeah it's it's a really
[53:03] really nice thing like words can say so
[53:06] much so
[53:08] it's it's the same with like music and
[53:10] colors
[53:12] yeah I use always music to to pump me up
[53:15] for workouts when I'm not when I'm not
[53:17] in the mood to
[53:19] it it's also kind of a trigger kind of
[53:22] hypnosis um perfect then let's come to
[53:24] our tine of the podcast where the
[53:27] previous guest is asking a question for
[53:28] the next guest uh and the question is an
[53:31] really interesting one uh uh what is the
[53:34] question that you have never been asked
[53:37] but you always wish to be
[53:39] asked so uh so like what is the question
[53:44] that you want to answer and what's the
[53:45] answer to
[53:48] that who who wants to start with that
[53:51] one
[54:01] yeah uh I want to start actually I think
[54:04] I really have to think about young kids
[54:08] and um I always like I wanted to show
[54:12] them how um how they can maybe help the
[54:16] kids to fall into sleep because uh this
[54:19] is something I'm I'm doing like with my
[54:21] own daughter she's two years now and of
[54:24] course sometimes it works sometimes it
[54:25] doesn't and to change your way quite
[54:29] often but uh kind of uh hypnosis Works
[54:33] definitely for kids to fall asleep and
[54:36] um currently like I'm on a stage where
[54:39] I'm just holding her hand and I try to
[54:42] like give her my energy and to slow down
[54:46] a little bit the rhythm of her heart and
[54:48] to you know slow down the pace and just
[54:52] make her more and more relaxed that at
[54:54] one point she can
[54:57] s and actually this is something I
[54:59] really would like to teach parents but I
[55:02] didn't find yet a way to like a setup a
[55:07] setup how I can do that because kids
[55:09] like kids behavior and kids uh feelings
[55:13] are so Random you know even like there's
[55:16] no time where all the kids are sleepy at
[55:17] the same time like maybe at night but
[55:20] then again they won't go to to a course
[55:23] you know nobody will come with a kid at
[55:25] at 8 with like taking the kid to a
[55:27] course at 8 and making them fall asleep
[55:30] and I cannot be next to the beds of
[55:32] people like trying to help them so I I
[55:34] have to I have to figure out how how I
[55:36] can do that but I really would love to
[55:38] help people
[55:41] parents I love it I love it a lot uh
[55:44] yeah
[55:49] Andreas yeah so um I think the the the
[55:54] best the best question to the no the
[55:57] best answer to the question I have never
[55:59] been asked but would like to be asked is
[56:02] it's you you is the answer for for
[56:06] everything because it's your life it's
[56:08] your Universe you decide so many things
[56:10] that you're not even aware of so
[56:13] whatever is the question in the end of
[56:15] the day you decide what the answer
[56:19] is I love that it's uh definitely out of
[56:23] the box thinking uh I love that some
[56:25] with Bitcoin especially with with the
[56:27] finance podcasting because even in
[56:30] Bitcoin there are a lot of um like
[56:32] there's like 80 90% of like Financial
[56:35] people in there uh that are really
[56:37] focused on how Bitcoin will evolve the
[56:40] financial system but then there's always
[56:42] this like once a week or every TW every
[56:46] second week I have this a little bit out
[56:48] of bound podcast and I love that and and
[56:51] people get always have amazing feedback
[56:54] around that usually a little less fuse
[56:56] let's let see how this goes uh maybe I
[56:58] can make a good thumbnail but usually
[57:01] it's a little bit less Fus but way more
[57:03] engagement way more comments way more
[57:05] like like oh this is was really good and
[57:08] I like those kind of sessions and thank
[57:10] you Andreas thank you Maria for for
[57:12] being on uh last questions when people
[57:15] actually want to take your service when
[57:17] people want to ask your questions when
[57:18] people want to reach out to you uh we I
[57:20] can Define
[57:24] you so I I think the easiest way is to
[57:27] contact us uh via Twitter it's
[57:30] _ coach um that's the account and also
[57:35] uh I would like that you might link us
[57:37] in the show notes so people can find us
[57:39] right here that would be very kind um
[57:42] which also brings me to the point I
[57:44] would like to change your final routine
[57:47] of the podcast just in this very special
[57:50] episode a tiny bit by um having an
[57:53] invitation for you uh to just Just Close
[57:56] Your Eyes for a minute maybe and relax a
[58:00] little bit because um if that's possible
[58:03] for you then I would like uh yeah to
[58:06] have some interactive thingy here could
[58:09] we do that I thought about that and I
[58:12] thought about if we maybe even do a
[58:14] special episode around that uh because
[58:17] now it's like end of the podcast uh and
[58:19] it would be interesting to maybe even
[58:22] set something up with a part two uh and
[58:26] make an actual uh small episode around
[58:30] that and then link it to that so uh
[58:33] that's like uh because I I would like to
[58:36] to uh have this in separate things if
[58:38] this is okay for
[58:40] you of course perfect no this is this is
[58:44] great I love it then then we then we
[58:47] have
[58:48] a another round uh because I would love
[58:52] always to like do a second round and I
[58:54] think now we talked about
[58:57] the the fees around that we talked a lot
[58:59] about the things that how can it be uh
[59:02] and then we can make a second round with
[59:03] an actual um objective of that and as
[59:08] you also said like uh it hypnosis is
[59:10] more like uh um better when you both
[59:13] know before you go in like what what we
[59:16] are doing and I think if we have like a
[59:18] small pre talk and then actually do it
[59:21] recorded that could be really
[59:23] interesting uh for people to watch and
[59:24] then we have like an act for example and
[59:26] I'm a really open guy so I'm sharing
[59:29] almost everything online uh and I think
[59:32] that that would be that would be perfect
[59:35] uh for for the three of
[59:38] us okay perfect yeah great then uh if if
[59:43] you see this episode later uh maybe it's
[59:45] already online then I will link it
[59:48] somewhere here I don't
[59:49] know uh and uh then uh thank you for for
[59:54] being on and thank you everyone for
[59:56] watching and listening I'll be back
[59:57] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
