[00:00] just print money out of literally
[00:01] nothing and that decides the value of
[00:04] everything teachers that'll go blast at
[00:06] me for trying to tell people about
[00:07] Bitcoin they'll say oh that's a scam
[00:09] that's a scam they don't even know about
[00:10] it they're not even encouraging learning
[00:12] the dollar will forever be going
[00:13] straight down it will delete the ability
[00:16] for government to act selfishly Bitcoin
[00:18] will be the backbone of money and it'll
[00:21] keep everything in check and it should
[00:23] improve quality of
[00:25] [Music]
[00:28] life you are my youngest guest I think
[00:31] by far uh my my till now youngest guest
[00:36] was 19 I think he was 19 how old are you
[00:41] I am
[00:42] 15 oh yeah like oh okay not by far like
[00:44] four years younger yeah let's let's see
[00:46] if we can get younger than that at some
[00:48] point but 15 is already very young yeah
[00:51] um what made you understand Bitcoin at
[00:55] such a young age I I can remember it in
[00:57] my age in your age uh uh I would I
[01:01] didn't even understand what money is
[01:02] like not even a
[01:04] clue yeah yeah that's a pretty common
[01:07] question I would say considering how
[01:08] young I am and my mom was probably the
[01:11] very first reason because she works very
[01:15] hard to take care of me and my brother
[01:18] and she kind of just would tell me about
[01:21] over the years of how stuff is getting
[01:23] more expensive at the grocery store and
[01:24] simple stuff like that and it kind of at
[01:27] first it didn't like matter to me of
[01:28] course cuz I was really young so like
[01:30] say I was 10 11 12 I be like oh yeah
[01:32] that's strange but I still want to go
[01:34] play video games that's about it and
[01:37] then I'll would say maybe around like
[01:39] 13 I started feeling the need to want to
[01:43] be ahead in life when I was older so
[01:45] this is before I even knew about Bitcoin
[01:47] or anything and I really was like yeah I
[01:50] don't want to work like 10 hours a day
[01:53] for the rest of my life once I turned 18
[01:55] and older and I was like dedicated on
[01:58] that I had zero clue how that was going
[02:00] to happen I was thinking of being an
[02:01] entrepreneur or anything and I was just
[02:03] hoping to find something I could start
[02:05] working on and then my mom found Bitcoin
[02:09] and I think it was like 2022 I think
[02:12] Christmas of
[02:13] 22 2020 I
[02:16] think yeah I think it was
[02:18] 2020 the Christmas and she would have
[02:21] tons of videos up on the TV out in the
[02:24] living room and I would be hearing them
[02:25] all the time she'd tell me about hey go
[02:27] listen to this go listen to this I
[02:29] wouldn't really care that was back by
[02:31] covid and everybody was at home we were
[02:33] all playing video games and one thing I
[02:35] realized was that some kids have it
[02:38] better than other people when it comes
[02:40] to going and buying shoes and expensive
[02:42] stuff like some kids could go to the
[02:44] mall like one of the big examples I uses
[02:46] I use is whenever I go to the mall with
[02:49] some friends like in the past they can
[02:51] go and find some nice pairs of Jordans
[02:53] or something some expensive shoes and
[02:56] they're hey Mom can I spend $350 on this
[02:59] pair of shoes and they said say yep he
[03:00] swiped the card and simple as that they
[03:03] don't understand how much work went into
[03:05] that and how they're not really that
[03:07] valuable at all considering you wear
[03:08] them around on the floor the whole day
[03:10] and we're all kids that'll grow out of
[03:12] them in a few
[03:13] years
[03:15] and with that I kind of started getting
[03:18] interested in how money works and how
[03:23] it's like kind of messed up my mom would
[03:26] tell me about it so I went down the
[03:28] rabbit hole I point out of my own
[03:31] curiosity and of course my mom was
[03:33] already into Bitcoin so started learning
[03:36] about some Bitcoin stuff and I read some
[03:39] Bitcoin books like I have a few back
[03:40] there I don't know if you can see
[03:42] them and I would say that was it that's
[03:45] what got me into
[03:47] it so that the the Injustice of the
[03:50] system that you saw um and it's also
[03:53] interesting how you got motivated of
[03:55] like oh I don't want to work 10 hours a
[03:56] day to to come like what what did
[03:59] triggered that like how how did that
[04:01] come up so what triggered me to not want
[04:04] to work that much is probably social
[04:06] media I'm being honest originally back
[04:09] whenever I was 10 11 12 I had Tik Tok
[04:13] scroll on it sometimes I wasn't ever on
[04:15] my devices as much as the average kid I
[04:18] would always enjoy going outside way
[04:19] more riding bikes me and my friends
[04:22] would make ramps outside and would crash
[04:24] and all the fun stuff but when I was
[04:27] online normally it would be like
[04:29] motivational stuff and one of the big
[04:31] things was all of the money stuff I
[04:35] would see I would see videos of people
[04:38] owning Lamborghinis and let's just say
[04:40] like Rich stuff I don't know if they
[04:41] were staged or not chances are they were
[04:43] just to get views because that's how
[04:44] most of the stuff is then kind of I just
[04:47] took interest to that like I had zero
[04:49] want to go and work hours and hours and
[04:52] hours to barely meet ends me like many
[04:55] many many adults do now cuz it's not
[04:58] their fault and that's what kind of was
[05:00] started leaning into was figuring out
[05:02] how to get ahead and at first I realized
[05:04] if you just put in at first I thought if
[05:07] you just work hard so let's just say you
[05:09] work hard at McDonald's for example
[05:12] you'll move up the chain and eventually
[05:13] become a boss and then you'll make a lot
[05:15] of money that's what I first thought
[05:16] when I was young and then as I started
[05:18] diving deeper I realized that's just
[05:20] simply not true nowadays whenever you
[05:22] work as hard as you can you will still
[05:25] not get anywhere in terms of succeeding
[05:29] I also heard I don't know I think I
[05:32] heard that you also read Rich dead ped I
[05:35] think that was also for me really uh
[05:37] influential in my my early days um did
[05:40] you read it and and did it change your
[05:43] views also on on on that which book it
[05:46] cut out really rich dad poad Rich Dad
[05:50] poad yes I did read like 90% of the book
[05:53] that was the first um book I probably
[05:55] read I think told my mom to get it and I
[05:58] saw that on social media actually for
[06:00] some of the people saying read this read
[06:02] that was my first book and I really
[06:05] enjoyed the book of course some of the
[06:07] stuff didn't apply to bitcoin that was
[06:09] the very first book I read it kind of
[06:11] taught me a little bit about debt and
[06:13] how that system works and how it's
[06:15] really not fair and how some people take
[06:17] advantage of it some people don't one of
[06:20] the biggest things I realize is that we
[06:21] don't get taught how to take advantage
[06:23] of it in school on purpose so that's one
[06:26] of the biggest ways they're getting at
[06:28] us starting a very young age why do you
[06:31] think it's uh important that people uh
[06:34] at your age or like like we actually
[06:37] from the same generation we both CH C's
[06:40] most people probably would not give me
[06:42] ches but chesa is still
[06:45] 9097 I think and I'm 1998 so I'm on the
[06:48] upper bound of of of Gene um why do you
[06:52] think it's it's so important uh for us
[06:54] Young Folks to understand uh
[06:56] Bitcoin well I think it's really
[06:59] important for for people to understand
[07:00] Bitcoin because it's more than just a
[07:03] way to get a return on investment so
[07:05] when I talk to like Financial dads or
[07:08] anybody in school I would say parents
[07:10] like when I'm out a little party or
[07:11] something they talk to me if I'm wearing
[07:12] a Bitcoin shirt a lot of the biggest
[07:14] things I hear is Bitcoin is a scam
[07:16] they'll be like hey Ben you know Bitcoin
[07:17] is a scam be careful because people
[07:20] aren't really educated
[07:23] and then I try to explain to them that
[07:27] it's much more than just trying to get
[07:29] money back back and I go into saying how
[07:30] it's debased and how it's its own way of
[07:34] money it's like something we've never
[07:35] seen before it's connected in a whole
[07:38] another like Dimension that's how I
[07:39] think about in my brain like a very
[07:41] complicated way so I start to try to
[07:43] explain to them that side of it I would
[07:47] say interesting
[07:50] uh how successful are you with with
[07:52] talking to your peers uh in in about
[07:55] Bitcoin and money so last year was
[07:58] whenever I first started picking it up
[07:59] in our brain a lot and started being
[08:01] able to explain it wasn't as well last
[08:04] year but this year I'm starting to get
[08:05] into some kids brains like I'm telling
[08:07] them to install a little wallet on their
[08:09] phone I can send them a few SATs and
[08:12] just trying to start to get them hooked
[08:13] like every now everybody knows I'm not
[08:17] wrong but people are still like worried
[08:20] about trying to jump in because they
[08:21] just probably are procrastinating or
[08:23] feeling oh if everybody else is going to
[08:25] college and working I'll do the same
[08:27] thing it'll work out fine but then they
[08:29] don't realize how fast money is going
[08:31] bad at an exponential rate they think
[08:33] it's just going to keep going steady
[08:34] like this or down I would say they think
[08:37] but in reality it's going to go like
[08:39] this and once you get stuck down here
[08:41] when it's going straight down it's
[08:43] impossible to get back up to be able to
[08:44] own a house or a car or anything worth
[08:47] value is is that a thing that uh that
[08:50] that you want to have a house someday do
[08:52] you want to have thing and and then you
[08:54] just see like the that the progressing
[08:56] like the the progress is like always
[08:58] harder and harder like the the house and
[09:00] the expensive stuff like keeps getting
[09:03] further away from you yeah that's one of
[09:05] the main things I realized with my mom
[09:08] helping me realize that is that to own
[09:11] like valuable assets let just say a
[09:13] house it's going to get harder and
[09:15] harder and harder for you to have all
[09:18] that money to spend and put down on a
[09:20] house and keep that money up it's just
[09:22] going to be impossible because they're
[09:24] going to get more and more expensive
[09:26] because the top like 10% are going to
[09:28] own all the houses they're going to keep
[09:30] making stuff more and more expensive
[09:31] while the bottom doesn't have any money
[09:34] coming in with assets flowing and the
[09:37] top does so then it's just going to keep
[09:39] making a bigger and bigger gap between
[09:41] the rich and the poor I think that it is
[09:45] going to be important for people to
[09:47] realize that it's going to be probably
[09:49] impossible for anybody to own a house in
[09:52] the future the houses are going to get
[09:53] very expensive because of the
[09:57] inflationary system and they teach in
[10:00] school that it is normal for stuff to go
[10:02] up in value and they say that in all the
[10:05] economics classes and stuff I'm in high
[10:08] school now so I'm starting to see some
[10:10] of it and realize how like rigged it is
[10:13] and even the teaching is wrong like
[10:15] there's some teachers that'll go blast
[10:18] at me for trying to tell people about
[10:19] Bitcoin they say oh that's a scam that's
[10:21] a scam they don't even know about it so
[10:23] they're not even encouraging learning or
[10:24] learning outside of the box so I feel
[10:27] like people are just going to be trapped
[10:29] in the state of being very behind being
[10:32] in debt by a lot without any assets
[10:34] coming in we're going to spend and spend
[10:36] and spend without money that we have and
[10:39] it'll just leave us in a trap for like
[10:41] our whole lives pretty much and that's
[10:42] going to keep happening more and more at
[10:45] exponential rate with how money is right
[10:47] now wait wait so so teachers um call
[10:52] attack you basically for for you being
[10:55] in Bitcoin and and uh they say that you
[10:58] have like a scam going yeah some some
[11:01] teachers have before not all of them but
[11:03] there are some like last year at had a
[11:05] teacher whenever I was talking about
[11:08] Bitcoin to some kids like during some
[11:10] off work time or when we were all doing
[11:12] work and able to talk and I was just
[11:15] talking about it and they were starting
[11:16] to ask questions kind of starting to get
[11:17] hooked me like how do you buy it how do
[11:21] you not get scammed how do you make sure
[11:23] they're sending it to you if you're
[11:24] sending them money I was answering all
[11:27] the questions and then the teacher uh
[11:29] just kind of jumped in and was like Ben
[11:31] you know Bitcoin is a scam and then she
[11:34] is a teacher so she was talking with
[11:35] authority she was talking pretty loud so
[11:38] the whole class would hear more than
[11:39] just the kids I was next to and then I
[11:42] said how is it a scam to her and she
[11:45] said because it's not backed by any
[11:47] government and it's just backed by
[11:49] people so it's a big Ponzi scam is what
[11:51] she said and I said that's just simply
[11:54] not
[11:55] true because if it's backed by everybody
[11:58] around the world then that means it's
[12:00] more secure than the government's money
[12:03] which is just backed by their words
[12:05] which is equal to nothing because
[12:06] they're just rich people that say stuff
[12:09] and then she got kind of upet because I
[12:11] wasn't arguing but she said something
[12:13] and I said something back and then she
[12:16] kind of that she didn't raise her voice
[12:17] that's when she got kind of upset so I
[12:20] kind of backed down and then she was
[12:22] like no that's not true Bitcoin is a
[12:25] scam and kind of just shut the whole
[12:27] thing up which the kids were like what
[12:29] oh that was kind of weird why' the
[12:31] teacher get so defensive on the money
[12:33] thing so that's one thing that happened
[12:36] last year and that was pretty crazy in
[12:37] my opinion considering she's a teacher
[12:40] teaching the 30 kids in the class try to
[12:43] trying to teach them to be better for
[12:45] their future and they she just pulled
[12:46] that out all of a
[12:48] sudden was that teacher and economics
[12:51] teacher or just like a general it was
[12:53] the General teacher I'm not going to say
[12:55] who it is in case
[12:57] somehow understand you should not say
[12:59] any names but it's interesting when when
[13:01] we talk about uh teachers that not don't
[13:03] even economics I
[13:05] mean for an economics teacher would even
[13:08] be
[13:09] worse in my understanding uh but just
[13:13] for for teachers to just get involved
[13:15] with that and and trying to like it it
[13:18] feels more more that school is less for
[13:20] to learn something and more to get an
[13:23] ideology in in in kids do do you feel
[13:26] like that yeah completely sure like they
[13:30] are teaching us how to stay inside the
[13:34] box and not ever try to jump out and
[13:37] become successful or in my opinion would
[13:39] be successful if you do what everybody
[13:41] else does you won't have what you want
[13:45] to have CU most people don't have what
[13:48] you want to have and there's a lot of
[13:50] reasons why but the very base of it is
[13:53] money and how it
[13:55] works because like some people would say
[13:58] oh well everybody can't be rich which is
[14:02] true depending on what your definition
[14:04] of rich is but everybody could have more
[14:07] than what we have like in the past like
[14:09] I don't I'm not good with numbers
[14:10] because I'm not old like I haven't lived
[14:13] in the 70s 80s 90s but I have heard from
[14:16] reading by my mom that like in general
[14:19] everything was a little bit easier back
[14:21] then like you could have a family of
[14:22] four and a husband work a job a normal
[14:25] job like a plumber or work for a company
[14:27] or a corporation
[14:29] and that husband would bring in enough
[14:31] money for the whole family to have a
[14:33] decent sized house a car and would be
[14:36] pretty fine go to college for that and
[14:38] would have a pretty good life because he
[14:39] worked hard and did what he wanted to do
[14:42] and it just works out like the original
[14:44] American Dream you go to school you go
[14:45] to college and you'll be set up for the
[14:48] rest of your life now that's just so not
[14:49] true because of how messed up everything
[14:52] is with money and how much that
[14:55] exponential line is moving all the money
[14:58] is flowing to I'm just going to say the
[15:01] top
[15:02] 10% faster and faster and faster and
[15:06] it'll just keep happening like that so
[15:08] they'll keep collecting money leaving
[15:10] less money for people down here so the
[15:12] more money they put in the more money
[15:15] that goes up like that everybody down
[15:18] here doesn't get any money coming down
[15:20] because they get paid the same amount
[15:24] whether people up here are getting more
[15:26] or less
[15:29] h i I love that a lot that you that you
[15:32] already see that like I I needed like at
[15:34] least like 23 or four get that um kudos
[15:39] to you um what do you think uh in
[15:42] general is
[15:44] is because school is an interesting
[15:46] thing for me like first of all I think
[15:48] it's good that young people learn uh the
[15:52] basics and learn a lot but uh it's not
[15:55] good to use that system to to bring some
[15:59] ideology in into society like that's
[16:01] that's not true uh that should not be
[16:04] the case and I also think like uh you
[16:06] should always have the possibility to
[16:08] possibility to have kids schooled at
[16:11] home if the parents can do that like
[16:13] that's a hard thing uh for for parents
[16:15] to do because you need the time and the
[16:17] money um which Mo most uh don't have
[16:21] both uh because of the the theat system
[16:25] um what do you think is is is wrong with
[16:27] the the school system on what what would
[16:29] you improve interesting for you to hear
[16:31] because you're right now still in there
[16:34] yeah I think there's a lot wrong with
[16:35] the school system like more than ever
[16:37] now that I'm done with Elementary School
[16:41] in middle school I can see kind of how
[16:43] much time I'm wasting at school school
[16:45] is like eight hours a day not counting
[16:47] Sports and I go to I have four periods I
[16:51] don't have eight I have a block schedule
[16:53] and each class is an hour and 30 minutes
[16:56] and I would say we do on average like I
[16:59] would get 15 minutes of learning done
[17:02] and maybe 40 minutes of work which is
[17:04] just like fake work like you just have
[17:06] to read stuff and write stuff you you're
[17:08] not actually
[17:09] engaged and 15 minutes of learning is
[17:11] not a lot in my opinion for having an
[17:13] hour and 30 minute class I think that
[17:15] school could be much shorter and we
[17:17] would learn the same amount if everybody
[17:20] was actually engaged but I think school
[17:22] is just in place we're teaching us how
[17:24] to work a normal schedule like an 8 hour
[17:26] a day schedule it's the same thing have
[17:29] breaks I think it's designed to just
[17:32] keep us locked in like that and
[17:35] homeschooling which I know a lot of
[17:36] people that do homeschooling I'm I'm
[17:38] located in Florida so we have Florida
[17:40] Virtual School which is a online school
[17:44] provided by the state and that any kid
[17:46] could do it and you don't need a parent
[17:48] to teach you because you do it on the
[17:49] computer which a lot could argue you
[17:52] need to go in in person which I agree
[17:55] that you should have friends be able to
[17:58] play Sports which you can do online
[18:02] nowadays you can still play sports at a
[18:03] school I'm not going to get deep into
[18:05] that but if you could have your own
[18:07] schedule you can get all your school
[18:09] work done online which they learn the
[18:11] same amount in two and a half hours
[18:13] every single day two and a half hours to
[18:15] three hours a day for four days a week
[18:18] instead of five days so I know a couple
[18:20] kids that do that and then they have
[18:22] their whole day to go and play their
[18:24] Sports they could work they could go
[18:26] engage in a business they could intern
[18:28] for somebody be like if we could have
[18:31] actual School scheduled like that it
[18:34] could be very beneficial but then the
[18:37] kids that aren't interested in their
[18:38] future will not do anything beneficial
[18:42] which that could create problems so
[18:43] there's two sides of it and a lot of it
[18:45] has to do with parenting a lot of it has
[18:47] to deal with whether a kid's brain is
[18:50] opened up or not opened up like how
[18:51] mature they are or unmature like I don't
[18:54] really I don't really know how to
[18:55] explain it but you get what I'm
[18:57] saying absolutely yeah it's um I I think
[19:02] we need um we need to get back to resp
[19:07] being responsible like giving
[19:09] individuals more freedom to um succeed
[19:13] but also to mess up like the school
[19:15] system is designed so you basically
[19:17] cannot really uh mess up anything like
[19:20] you you just go there you sit there if
[19:23] if you're like most people come through
[19:26] school and they they get some degree uh
[19:28] even if if if they don't uh do anything
[19:31] great in there but it's like it's it's a
[19:33] school system designed to to make you
[19:36] conform as you there with like the the
[19:37] work hours and to make you conform with
[19:40] like a normal work schedule so you can
[19:42] be good in a normal work job and that's
[19:45] fine if people want to do that like
[19:46] that's like that's not not something bad
[19:50] but I people should have another option
[19:52] like people should know there's another
[19:54] option and not be like hidden from that
[19:58] or keep their eyes closed that's what
[19:59] school does I would say like I used to
[20:01] talk about it as in goggles you can have
[20:04] different lenses of how you see the
[20:06] world like I used to just see like
[20:09] whenever I was younger only things I
[20:11] really thought about was Friends food SL
[20:14] candy and like video games and having
[20:18] fun with sports now it's much more than
[20:21] that my time preference has gotten a lot
[20:23] larger which that comes with maturing
[20:26] and I'm I'm seeing everything much
[20:28] differently now that they know about
[20:29] Bitcoin and proof of work and how
[20:32] nothing is free and how they just print
[20:36] money out of literally nothing and that
[20:38] decides the value of everything and I
[20:42] think people should take that a little
[20:44] bit more seriously like you can be a
[20:48] like a painter or a dancer that you
[20:50] don't actually provide anything that has
[20:54] like needed value to somebody I don't
[20:56] know I don't know how to say that in a
[20:57] rude way like you don't need a painting
[20:59] to survive but there are plenty of
[21:01] artists that get plenty of money which I
[21:04] think that's fine but even an artist
[21:06] would have to understand how money works
[21:07] so they can make the right decisions on
[21:09] how to survive and what to buy and what
[21:11] not to buy and how to use their debt
[21:14] that's very true it's it's it's
[21:16] interesting when when you talk about uh
[21:19] like like I think financial literacy is
[21:22] something that people of like 50 60
[21:25] years old sometimes don't know about uh
[21:27] so it's always interesting to to hear
[21:29] people really young uh getting it how
[21:33] would you say right now in your peer
[21:35] group and maybe also like against cool
[21:37] um how much fin financial literacy is is
[21:41] taught and uh how much financial
[21:43] literacy do you see in your PS Group uh
[21:47] very low amount I'm taking economics
[21:52] now wait no I took economics I'm taking
[21:55] economics last year I'm taking marketing
[21:58] right now now cuz that's the only class
[22:00] I could take and I'm also taking Finance
[22:03] school just started so I'm still getting
[22:05] my schedules down and even with those
[22:08] two classes which I like those classes
[22:10] because I'm just getting to engage in at
[22:12] least something that I like in school
[22:14] those classes people don't really care
[22:16] at all about money so they won't learn
[22:20] like one thing I've noticed with playing
[22:22] video games I used to play video games a
[22:23] whole lot which is normal because I also
[22:26] played Sports so I was still healthy is
[22:29] I learned how to learn playing video
[22:31] games because I would take them very
[22:32] seriously which they sound kind of nerdy
[22:35] or bad or whatever but whenever I would
[22:38] start to do something new I'd obsess
[22:39] into it I'd figure out how to learn so I
[22:42] feel like with that I've learned how to
[22:43] learn very well and school just doesn't
[22:46] teach that the same way and if nobody
[22:49] wants to learn and isn't obsessed then
[22:51] they won't retain any of the information
[22:53] which that's fine for like math and
[22:55] reading cuz all they want us to do is
[22:56] get a a on a test once a week and we'll
[22:59] never see that subject again until the
[23:01] end of the year for the final exam which
[23:03] then it's just one of each thing pretty
[23:05] much with them having us learn like that
[23:08] we won't care about anything we learn
[23:11] and it's teaching us that learning is
[23:13] boring learning is a onewe process of
[23:15] doing this memorizing it for just a week
[23:18] with a couple flashcards then putting
[23:20] down the answer and you never see it
[23:21] again when I think learning is very much
[23:24] different than that
[23:26] and it's I can see the effect of it
[23:29] having on kids is now kids are starting
[23:32] to want money they're starting to want
[23:34] to buy their own shoes and they're
[23:35] realizing oh crap $350 takes a long time
[23:40] to save up with when having to pay taxes
[23:44] and all the other expenses they're
[23:45] having to pay for
[23:48] and that's going to start teaching them
[23:50] but I feel like by the time people start
[23:53] graduating from high school getting into
[23:55] college they're making those lifelong
[23:58] decisions of getting into
[23:59] debt before
[24:02] learning about money or literature money
[24:05] literature money literature so I'm got
[24:08] I'm I can't speak that well right now
[24:10] but you get what I'm saying they'll get
[24:12] into problems before actually
[24:15] understanding what they're getting into
[24:16] due to money not being taught at all at
[24:19] school and I wouldn't even Define it as
[24:21] money I would just say proof of work and
[24:24] how everybody's time is valuable and
[24:27] depending on how they spend it
[24:29] 100% And and you're speaking really good
[24:31] I love it a lot um how would you say has
[24:34] has Bitcoin then already influenced uh
[24:37] your life and your view of things yes so
[24:42] I would say it has a lot this I could y
[24:44] about it for a very very long time
[24:46] Bitcoin has taught me like I've been
[24:49] saying proof of work and I'll just do a
[24:51] little Deep dive cuz I've been thinking
[24:53] about it on this
[24:55] crazy way of like in my brain Dimensions
[24:59] I know it's not scientific like
[25:00] Dimension dimensional planes and
[25:02] everything is completely different on a
[25:04] scientific level so I've heard Jack MERS
[25:06] talk about it this way but I've been
[25:09] thinking about it this way since last
[25:10] year I used to draw it up on the boards
[25:11] for
[25:12] fun
[25:14] Bitcoin is very interesting in terms of
[25:17] how it exists because it like kind of
[25:20] scratches your brain at first like it
[25:22] doesn't make any sense how it exists but
[25:25] you can't see it you can't hold it on
[25:28] unlike money which you can hold it
[25:30] except money is nothing more than a
[25:33] piece of paper which people don't really
[25:35] see that like oh I want I would rather
[25:36] have a $100 bill than one Bitcoin which
[25:40] you probably seen clips of people
[25:42] getting ass on the street which of
[25:43] course that's just reviews because
[25:44] nobody knew what Bitcoin was back then
[25:46] so here would you rather have this $100
[25:48] bill or I'll send you one real Bitcoin
[25:51] they'll be like well how do I know what
[25:52] Bitcoin is how do I know it's not fake
[25:54] how do I know it won't become fake in
[25:56] the future or get shut down but I know
[25:58] that $100 bill is worth something $100
[26:01] bill is worth something according to our
[26:03] government and proof of stake that they
[26:06] will hold it up and we're trusting them
[26:10] not verifying we're just trusting them
[26:12] to do what they say and they'll keep it
[26:14] afloat while Bitcoin is very much
[26:17] different you cannot hold Bitcoin you
[26:19] can't see it but it does exist so I'm
[26:23] going to say time goes like this on a
[26:27] plane all my I'm moving my hands right
[26:29] now so I hope the video goes through
[26:30] later and then space the other dimension
[26:34] is a circle that goes around the plane
[26:38] of time inside of the time plane which
[26:43] is two lines there is energy which I
[26:46] normally just draw little circles pretty
[26:48] simple that's what reality we live in is
[26:51] in between time space open space and
[26:56] energy all those together that's what we
[26:58] see in living for
[27:01] example even our own eyes deceive us
[27:04] with energy so we can't even fully trust
[27:07] our eyes but one thing we can trust is
[27:10] time or at least our perception of time
[27:13] because something we can always know
[27:15] there's a past there's a now and there's
[27:16] a future Bitcoin is very interesting
[27:20] because it doesn't lay inside of our um
[27:27] time space an energy Dimension lays
[27:30] outside of it like completely outside of
[27:33] it except it's in the
[27:36] time and it is in the space but it's not
[27:40] in the same one we're in because we
[27:43] can't see it and we can't hold it like
[27:45] it's not it doesn't have real energy
[27:48] linked all together but of course you I
[27:51] know you already know how Bitcoin works
[27:52] but many other people don't it is linked
[27:55] to our Dimension with proof of work
[28:00] and and how math keeps it all together
[28:04] that's like my absolute favorite part is
[28:06] how math is the only true way of
[28:09] thinking in my opinion I know Bas I'm
[28:11] not a technical person but code goes all
[28:13] the way down to ones and zeros the very
[28:16] basic and without that of course you
[28:19] wouldn't know anything the government
[28:21] does not use math like they don't
[28:23] nothing is backed any anybody could
[28:26] press a button and have more money be
[28:29] printed and doesn't have any value at
[28:33] all but Bitcoin has value decided by
[28:36] everybody around the world and it's
[28:38] backed by everybody around the world and
[28:41] I just like I I could y about it for a
[28:43] long time and try to get how I think
[28:45] about it over here but I'm not going to
[28:48] try to do that that would be like
[28:50] impossible but I hope you try I hope you
[28:52] kind of get what I'm saying and how it's
[28:55] not in our reality but it's linked to it
[28:58] and it exists just as much as a brick
[29:01] does if not more if not more because we
[29:06] know the math is true but you know our
[29:08] eyes can deceive us very much so with
[29:11] lots of things as well as our hands as
[29:13] well as our touch our senses were more
[29:15] unreliable than math is itself math is
[29:18] true if you watch or listen to my
[29:21] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[29:23] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[29:25] the most important step is to keep keep
[29:28] the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[29:31] hardware wallet my personal
[29:32] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[29:34] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[29:37] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[29:39] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an

[30:34] and last but not least I have something
[30:36] completely new for you guys I partnered
[30:39] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[30:43] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[30:46] saw created by anyone look at that
[30:49] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[30:51] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[30:55] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[30:58] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:00] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[31:04] make sure to check out the link in the
[31:05] description for this amazing coin
[31:08] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[31:10] amazing I love them so much it was
[31:12] really hard for me to pick the one that
[31:14] I want to have because there are a lot
[31:16] of great options I went with the new
[31:19] transparency Edition they're all limited
[31:22] so grab yours those will not be
[31:25] available for a long time but there will
[31:27] come new model model and new amazing
[31:29] designs along the way absolutely and
[31:31] it's also interesting how when you talk
[31:34] to a Nori he also thinks like that that
[31:36] fat money is uh a real thing like he
[31:40] actually thinks like this this piece of
[31:42] paper has value uh and I I'm stunned by
[31:46] how many people still believe that uh
[31:49] that the current the fear currenc is
[31:50] still backed by gold oh my gosh me too I
[31:53] hear it in school all the
[31:55] time actually you you still he it yeah
[31:59] not not by teachers as much I had one
[32:01] teacher think that it was backed by gold
[32:05] they said like it was backed not by
[32:07] actual gold but by like paper gold or
[32:10] something that was a bit ago I don't I
[32:12] don't remember completely about that but
[32:14] somebody kind of thought that but lots
[32:16] of the kids still think that money is
[32:19] equal to gold and that's why it has
[32:22] value which is crazy that they don't
[32:24] know that like I don't understand how
[32:27] that's not soon as we get into sixth
[32:29] seventh and eighth grade and we start
[32:30] having to make money decisions I think
[32:32] the first thing we should be taught is
[32:35] that money is not backed by gold and
[32:38] that you have to have a constant flow of
[32:40] it to keep your time and energy as in
[32:44] wealth the stuff you've worked for to
[32:47] keep it equal the same to everything
[32:50] else you buy and spend you have to be
[32:52] constantly having and making more and
[32:54] more of it which it shouldn't be that
[32:56] way at all I think that's one of the
[32:57] first things we should learn but nobody
[32:59] teaches us that at all I think that's
[33:01] very sad that we don't get taught that
[33:04] nobody knows do you think that the the
[33:06] feat system uh in in general could die
[33:10] off within your lifespan I think about
[33:12] that a lot like those are one of those
[33:14] thoughts I just have on going to bed or
[33:15] something like if Bitcoin is so good and
[33:19] like it's just it's just such an amazing
[33:21] creation it's like the first thing we've
[33:24] created that actually checks all the
[33:26] boxes off for perfect money mean if
[33:29] everybody knew about it and understood
[33:31] it without a doubt all the lower class
[33:34] that isn't already ahead using Fiat
[33:38] would switch to it immediately if
[33:40] everybody could understand it magically
[33:43] uh like by overnight like if what's that
[33:46] one quote if everybody realized how uh
[33:50] the government and money worked
[33:52] overnight there would be World War 3i in
[33:53] the morning I think it's something like
[33:56] that something crazy like that if
[33:58] everybody figured it out everybody would
[34:00] jump off of the dollar and all the other
[34:02] currencies and on the Bitcoin pretty
[34:04] much right away they realized how good
[34:06] it is even if the even if on a chart
[34:08] Bitcoin was going like this straight up
[34:10] if everybody truly understood it how I
[34:13] do and most other real bitcoiners know
[34:16] it's always going to be worth more than
[34:18] dollars because dollars how we think
[34:22] about it on when we view in like trading
[34:23] view or any type of chart dollars has
[34:28] let's just say $1 is straight
[34:30] across and then the whatever we're
[34:33] comparing it to goes up and down if we
[34:36] use Bitcoin as straight across one
[34:39] Bitcoin then the dollar will forever be
[34:42] going straight down it's just how it
[34:45] works that's what I that's what I try to
[34:48] tell people is that the dollar will
[34:51] forever be going straight down and
[34:53] Bitcoin will either be equal or we'll be
[34:57] growing into value as more people adopt
[34:58] it sure right now it goes up and down
[35:01] compared to the dollar but I would say
[35:04] going up and down compared to going
[35:06] straight
[35:07] down like for a onee chart is still more
[35:11] valuable like and if you go to four
[35:13] years and eight years it's just without
[35:15] a doubt like if I had the time to sit
[35:17] down and talk with anybody for 5 10
[35:20] minutes that was an adult or a teenager
[35:23] they would completely understand what
[35:24] I'm saying you get what I mean M yeah
[35:28] it's also interesting uh um how how
[35:31] early we are in in that game when we
[35:34] think about it and do you also
[35:36] like what is kind of your vision for for
[35:39] Bitcoin like what what does uh Bitcoin
[35:42] is successful like let's say Bitcoin is
[35:45] successful in 50 years uh or like even
[35:48] like 70 years what that does that mean
[35:51] uh for you Bitcoin being successful what
[35:54] does it look like yeah so I'm not a
[35:57] macroeconomic genius but I do know that
[36:01] governments are going to still need
[36:02] power like we won't have a government no
[36:06] government system for hundreds of years
[36:09] cuz we're humans we're still dummies and
[36:12] people for will forever be Thieves and
[36:14] steel stuff we'll always need at least
[36:17] in my lifetime in my opinion we'll need
[36:18] a government to keep us safe and the
[36:23] basics but as people start to know we
[36:26] have Bitcoin for our value and our
[36:28] monetary system I think that Bitcoin
[36:31] will be like a backbone to keeping
[36:34] everything in check like everything it
[36:37] will delete the ability for government
[36:41] to act selfishly because if they do
[36:44] everybody will just go to
[36:45] bitcoin if they I think that it won't be
[36:49] only Bitcoin I don't think that it'll
[36:50] work like that for a bit if it
[36:53] unless crazy crazy stuff I don't know I
[36:56] don't actually think Bitcoin it won't
[36:58] ever be just Bitcoin at least in my
[37:00] lifetime but I think Bitcoin will be the
[37:02] backbone of money and it'll keep
[37:06] everything in check and it should
[37:08] improve quality of life my opinion I
[37:10] don't know how the road's going to go to
[37:13] get there though I think that could be
[37:15] rough depending on how stuff goes
[37:16] because like either the government could
[37:18] accept it or they could completely flip
[37:21] upside down and view it as a humongous
[37:23] threat to all civilization and
[37:26] government I'm not really sure like
[37:27] that's just an open question it's like
[37:30] possible to really know
[37:34] but it's a lot you get what I mean it is
[37:37] a lot it's there's so many variables at
[37:41] play and tot understand that like if um
[37:45] it's also interesting to to to speculate
[37:48] exactly about that like how does Bitcoin
[37:50] look like in 203 50 years um will be
[37:54] very interesting to see what what what
[37:57] will be possible and what will not be
[37:59] possible so uh I'm I'm looking forward
[38:01] to I'm looking forward to a world with
[38:04] with Bitcoin and I'm like yeah as
[38:06] yourself you you we are both like kind
[38:08] of on the start of our lives and I think
[38:10] we will see a um a czy Bitcoin world uh
[38:15] Bitcoin adoption uh within our lives and
[38:18] I hope we can see like a a full Bitcoin
[38:21] standard at some point or if not us at
[38:24] least our kids yeah yeah like yeah
[38:28] that's what that's what I'm thinking by
[38:29] Bitcoin standard I don't like I can't
[38:31] jump exactly at I don't mean everybody
[38:34] only uses Bitcoin if there's no dollars
[38:36] at all then there's no government or if
[38:39] there's no money for the government then
[38:42] the government just can't exist but if
[38:45] there's
[38:46] Bitcoin and dollars or they somehow come
[38:49] up with an online dollars backed by
[38:52] Bitcoin or something like that then I
[38:55] think we could see a Bitcoin standard
[38:57] world plus whatever country you're
[38:59] living in currency usage like that so
[39:02] then if the government was um using
[39:07] Bitcoin and was I don't want to say
[39:09] backed by Bitcoin but
[39:11] like had Bitcoin as a standard way of
[39:16] having a currency and without
[39:18] overinflating anything without funding
[39:20] Wars with money they don't have it all
[39:23] cuz I hope there won't be any wars in
[39:25] the future cuz there's no reason have
[39:27] them with how advanced civilization is
[39:29] now I don't want to get into that that's
[39:31] very political I don't really have a say
[39:32] on that considering I'm so young but I
[39:34] just don't like the idea of people
[39:36] getting hurt if you get what I'm saying
[39:39] and I think that if the government was
[39:44] scared to lose their
[39:48] population's um side with their currency
[39:51] then they wouldn't make as many ER
[39:52] radical decisions and would be more
[39:55] balanced with their power and they Press
[39:58] buttons to print trillions of dollars
[40:00] within seconds just because they want to
[40:02] boost the economy for one year and don't
[40:05] really care about the effects it'll have
[40:08] in 10 years you get what I'm saying
[40:10] because then if they do make a decision
[40:11] like that and people are educated and
[40:13] know that Bitcoin exists and they'll be
[40:15] like oh well I'm not going to be a part
[40:17] of that I'm going to use Bitcoin for now
[40:18] because they're being dumb they're going
[40:21] completely off track of what they should
[40:22] be doing and I know that's not a good
[40:25] thing that would be if everybody knew
[40:27] that Bitcoin exists and everybody kind
[40:29] of understood how money worked better so
[40:31] a Bitcoin standard basically and how
[40:33] proof of work
[40:35] works yeah totally and it's like it's
[40:37] it's interesting because like government
[40:39] has two ways to fund themselves like
[40:40] taxes and inflation like money printing
[40:44] uh which is like if if inflation money
[40:46] printing Falls away they have to
[40:49] convince people to pay taxes um which
[40:52] then is also way harder when they have
[40:55] uh sound money which can be transferred
[40:58] so easily so there's like a game theory
[41:01] starting around nation states that like
[41:04] oh I have the lowest taxes for Bitcoin
[41:05] no I have the lowest ta we already see
[41:07] it a little bit like as Salvador in
[41:10] other nations maybe even like with the
[41:12] US when when Trump comes in and maybe he
[41:15] does delete Cal gain stacks on on
[41:17] bitcoin not impossible but yeah very a
[41:21] lot of variables still there yeah um
[41:24] really interesting what's what's
[41:25] happening with the world
[41:29] and also interesting uh what what you
[41:31] are doing what projects uh are you
[41:34] working currently on in in
[41:36] Bitcoin yeah
[41:38] so I am currently a student athlete and
[41:43] a full-time high schooler so a student
[41:45] athlete so I would say the majority of
[41:47] my day is not spent working on bitcoin
[41:50] which is true don't want to lie or ever
[41:52] say I am when I'm not but my values of
[41:56] life will will always
[41:58] be bu Bitcoin like I I live in Orange
[42:02] world not a red or a blue or just school
[42:06] or just football or just dopamine have
[42:10] fun I live in Orange World which I would
[42:12] say is pretty balanced my goal is to
[42:15] stay balanced with everything I'm doing
[42:17] between time preference if I'm too too
[42:20] far ahead then I just won't enjoy my
[42:22] time now I could burn out and that would
[42:24] be really sucky like I'm not going to
[42:25] torture Myself by not ever going out
[42:27] with my friends just
[42:30] to work on my future I will do it more
[42:35] than I say the average kid my age would
[42:38] which is fine as in my opinion that
[42:40] would be a balance but I would say I
[42:42] keep it balanced what I'm working on
[42:44] right
[42:44] now is I'm I'm part of this group that
[42:48] one of my friends dad started that is
[42:51] about teenagers trying to get ahead and
[42:54] it's not just Bitcoin it's economic
[42:58] and there's some trading in it but I'm
[43:00] working with that and I'm going to be
[43:02] leading the Bitcoin classes and I'm
[43:05] going try to work with that and see if
[43:06] we can get some of the kids out to
[43:08] bitcoin conferences in the future and
[43:10] see how that could work and I'm also
[43:14] working on a project online let me check
[43:19] so I can make sure I get the name right
[43:22] in the wrong thing so that would be very
[43:26] bad I am
[43:28] working on it really quick so I can see
[43:31] the link path to Satoshi dcom with the
[43:35] friend and that's just a little website
[43:37] that's meant to teach and give a basic
[43:40] understanding and information of Bitcoin
[43:42] to anybody who has questions it has some
[43:44] questions that are listed common
[43:46] questions you click on it it's supposed
[43:49] to give a explanation with a picture
[43:53] easy to understand within a few
[43:56] paragraphs because I don't like telling
[43:59] people go read this book because they
[44:01] won't read the book unless they have
[44:03] more questions can only like start
[44:05] reading like for kids my age at least
[44:08] they don't have a humongous Wonder then
[44:11] they won't put in hours of work to
[44:13] figure something out unless they have a
[44:16] reason to so with the stuff I'm working
[44:18] on is to give a reason to want to learn
[44:23] and I'm going to be working on more
[44:24] projects as much as I can in the future
[44:26] try to get out the conferences and stuff
[44:28] as soon as football season ends I'm
[44:29] going to have a lot of time and that's
[44:31] when I'm going to really try to pick
[44:33] everything up and I need a job I do not
[44:34] have a job right now so I need to find
[44:36] some ways to start stacking STS yeah
[44:39] that's about it I'm not doing too much
[44:41] actively but I'm just a bitcoiner trying
[44:43] to help trying to do my best I can right
[44:45] now with my age really cool I love what
[44:48] you're doing and I also saw you attended
[44:51] Nashville is that DED yes that was very
[44:53] nice I really like seeing the
[44:55] city wh what what was your key takeaway
[44:58] from from the the bit from from this bit
[45:01] big Bitcoin conference probably getting
[45:04] to meet everybody I met in Miami it was
[45:08] just such a good experience to like
[45:12] Escape my world back at home of being
[45:15] made fun of to being accepted and
[45:17] admired for doing what I do it's
[45:20] probably my favorite things so just the
[45:21] whole thing together and I love getting
[45:23] to meet other people who think the same
[45:25] because it's so rare to see the whole
[45:27] year that I was stuck at home like very
[45:32] rarely meeting somebody that thinks the
[45:34] same who's probably like 40 years older
[45:36] than me some kid's dad like that's the
[45:39] max I would meet who has somewhat the
[45:42] same vision not even being bitcoiners
[45:44] but at the conference just meeting all
[45:46] the bitcoiners all thinking the same it
[45:48] just feels like a very unique experience
[45:51] you know what I'm saying do you do you
[45:53] get that push back the that you
[45:56] described before for from the teachers
[45:58] that they calling Bitcoin a scam also
[46:00] from your peers actually sometimes
[46:03] sometimes now I'm kind of known as a
[46:05] nerd not not in a bad way not nerd is in
[46:09] a like weird nerd nerd is in I know what
[46:14] I'm doing people know that I know what
[46:16] I'm doing but they don't really care
[46:21] like no I've last year was most of the
[46:26] not arguments but conversations I had
[46:28] with people about it who were like
[46:30] trying to they would say I'm trying to
[46:33] help you by telling you what the scam it
[46:35] went up before but then everybody knows
[46:37] it crash it's going to zero there was
[46:39] kids that would tell me that which I I
[46:42] think it's cool that they at least have
[46:43] heard of it before but from social media
[46:47] side they just say and hear whatever
[46:50] social media wants them to say and hear
[46:54] and it spreads like a wildfire about
[46:56] with social media and Tik Tok and all
[46:59] the reals all the apps that you just
[47:00] scroll with your phone or your thumb one
[47:03] video One video One video you scroll for
[47:07] 30 minutes you could be you could have
[47:09] your mind completely changed about
[47:10] something and be completely false just
[47:13] off of how convincing and psychological
[47:16] those videos are and they're crafted to
[47:19] be meant for certain age groups like you
[47:21] should see the steps people go to to
[47:23] trick people's brains and get those
[47:26] likes subscribes whether they're
[47:27] spreading good information or bad
[47:29] information which is what I would say I
[47:32] battle up against the most would be the
[47:34] groups people go in groups like let's
[47:37] just say there's a group of people that
[47:39] all have a certain jacket normally the
[47:43] jacket they're wearing is expensive
[47:46] because that's what's cool nowadays is
[47:49] to have the popular expensive thing I
[47:52] have a jacket that is not expensive but
[47:54] it's comfortable and it gives me
[47:57] superpowers this just for fun you get
[47:59] what I'm saying gives me superpowers
[48:02] even though it gives me superpowers and
[48:03] it's more comfortable it's cool the
[48:06] group will stay with their group and
[48:10] will say that's not cool it's not it's
[48:14] not good and I don't care it gives you
[48:17] superpowers because ours is better they
[48:20] feel safe saying that because they have
[48:23] everybody standing around them saying
[48:25] the same thing they're afraid to be like
[48:28] outside of the bubble cuz you won't get
[48:31] hate I wouldn't say nowadays maybe a few
[48:33] years ago you would get hate on my
[48:35] school there isn't really bullying but
[48:37] there are definitely sides with
[48:38] everything you're not in a group then
[48:41] you have nothing to really protect you
[48:44] like protect your opinions you have your
[48:46] own opinions and if it's not with a
[48:47] group then you could get made fun of or
[48:50] feel left out or something like that
[48:51] which I'm fine with because I truly
[48:53] believe what I say and know
[48:57] don't really believe in anything they
[48:59] say or no as long as it goes with the
[49:02] group and flows with social media and
[49:04] everything like that you get what I'm
[49:06] saying do do you also see a kind of a
[49:09] critical thinking crisis when when you
[49:12] when I hear for talking like that it's
[49:14] like H we just follow the the crowd yeah
[49:17] yeah for sure critical thinking is
[49:20] probably one of my favorite things to do
[49:22] like I'm one of those weird kids that I
[49:24] kind of enjoy or have enjoyed sometimes
[49:27] taking the math testing the State
[49:29] Testing which is just the big test at
[49:31] the end of the year cuz I get to sit
[49:33] down for sometime I mean I guess I enjoy
[49:35] the first like 30 minutes then I get
[49:37] bored but I like doing math I love math
[49:40] right now I'm just in like geometry just
[49:42] basic math and I enjoy having to use my
[49:46] brain to figure something out like it's
[49:48] probably just one of my favorite things
[49:49] I love figuring stuff out and learning
[49:52] and like being able to think
[49:54] differently than just being stuck on the
[49:57] same track so critical thinking I do not
[50:01] like reading or writing that much I'm
[50:04] not that good with it because with
[50:06] reading and writing as I've saw in
[50:08] school at least at the high school level
[50:10] and Middle School level you are taught
[50:13] to do everything a certain way or else
[50:15] you get a bad grade you write your essay
[50:16] this way with this many words speaking
[50:19] from this point of view and only from
[50:21] this way and in certain formats or else
[50:23] you get a bad
[50:24] grade which I don't like that at all
[50:27] which I know it's important for like
[50:28] college or whatever even though now
[50:30] everybody has robots do their stuff for
[50:32] them I do like math and science as it
[50:35] requires critical thinking and I think
[50:38] that it should be put more important
[50:40] than it is right now because everybody
[50:42] now just cheats on it so there's no
[50:44] critical thinking at all people can't
[50:45] decide things for
[50:48] themselves at all and will only decide
[50:51] things as a group and even if people
[50:54] like let's just say a kid is like oh
[50:56] maybe my jacket isn't as good as his
[50:58] superpowers jacket they're just too
[51:00] scared to go actually learn and think
[51:03] for themselves to say anything about it
[51:06] that's an interesting point I never
[51:08] thought about it but like right when I
[51:11] think back at my school time the all the
[51:14] school assignments could be solved by
[51:17] jbt really quickly now which which kind
[51:21] of turns off like oh why why why do you
[51:23] need for to to to think for yourself if
[51:26] you just get an assignment you do it
[51:28] with jat gbt and then like one week
[51:31] before the test you like Hammer
[51:33] everything in your brain so one day
[51:35] after you you forget everything is is
[51:36] that a reality I think that is reality
[51:39] in school right now I think that
[51:42] information we learn a lot of the times
[51:44] is pointless which I think that is okay
[51:47] like you won't remember some of the
[51:49] things from math 10 years from now which
[51:51] is normal but you will remember how you
[51:55] learned if you are good at learning then
[51:59] I think your ability to do stuff in the
[52:02] future and be able to work certain jobs
[52:06] and be able to just figure certain
[52:08] things out like being able to use your
[52:09] brain is I think such an important thing
[52:13] and of course having the ability to look
[52:15] it up which is what you will do when
[52:17] you're an adult or use a robot is cool
[52:20] but if the kids in school only do that
[52:24] for their work they're not learning how
[52:25] to learn like I could really care less
[52:27] whatever you're learning like doesn't
[52:30] normally matter like of course history
[52:32] is pretty important so learning that's
[52:35] nice and math is pretty important like
[52:38] Algebra I would say is really important
[52:41] and learning how to graph stuff and plan
[52:43] out your money but then of course in the
[52:44] future you can take a picture of any
[52:46] number equation and it gets solved by a
[52:49] robot
[52:50] instantly if you don't learn how to
[52:53] learn to do the math and like rewire
[52:57] your brain whenever you want then you
[53:01] won't be able to make decisions for
[53:03] yourself that's uh that's so true uh one
[53:06] last question before we come to the end
[53:08] want to get into um does everyone know
[53:13] the word Bitcoin and and do all of them
[53:17] affiliate something maybe it's just scam
[53:20] but uh do do they all affiliate
[53:22] something with Bitcoin my grade or
[53:24] people around me I wouldn't say it's
[53:25] completely
[53:27] known some people are like I mean of
[53:29] course everybody's heard the word
[53:30] Bitcoin now from whether it's like a
[53:34] joke Bitcoin or blah blah blah Bitcoin
[53:38] everybody has heard the word Bitcoin I
[53:40] would say 50% of kids know that Bitcoin
[53:43] is worth a lot of money no I was say
[53:46] more than 50 like 70 80% of kids know
[53:49] Bitcoin is worth a whole lot of dollars
[53:51] like that's one thing they can say yeah
[53:52] Ben isn't Bitcoin worth like $40,000 or
[53:55] $60,000 ,000 or $100,000 and I'm like
[53:58] yeah it's worth a lot they're like why
[54:00] would I buy if it's worth so much
[54:02] already so so that's one of the first
[54:05] things they think and then PE and then
[54:08] another thing is people say to scam
[54:11] to get you to lose your money or get you
[54:14] to give somebody else your money is
[54:16] another common thing and yeah I say
[54:19] those are the two most common things
[54:20] people think of when they hear the word
[54:22] Bitcoin without being taught at all or
[54:25] talked to just because of social media
[54:27] cuz like the last thing when Bitcoin was
[54:30] on Tik Tok and I remember seeing it on
[54:31] Tik Tok like would be common to see
[54:34] videos with a couple hundred thousand
[54:35] likes those videos were promoting scams
[54:40] they were promoting
[54:42] cryptocurrencies like like Dogecoin a
[54:44] lot of kids knew Dogecoin a lot of kids
[54:45] tried to buy Dogecoin and of course by
[54:48] the time those people were buying it by
[54:50] the time social media was telling people
[54:53] who can't think for themselves to do it
[54:56] that was a scam and it was already way
[54:57] too late which is that's when all the
[55:00] crashes happened for all the
[55:02] cryptocurrencies so social media did
[55:05] kind of screw over people's opinions on
[55:09] the word
[55:11] crypto Bitcoin I hate when people
[55:15] classify Bitcoin as
[55:18] cryptocurrency
[55:19] because you already know why they're
[55:22] much much different but I can't just say
[55:26] they're different when somebody says
[55:28] crypto whenever I say Bitcoin somebody
[55:31] else could say yeah crypto's a scam if I
[55:33] just say Well they're different that
[55:36] that doesn't like mean anything and then
[55:38] it's not like I have 10 minutes to sit
[55:40] down tell them why it's just stuck in
[55:43] their brain already because they saw a
[55:44] video that had a million likes that said
[55:47] it they think that's more credible than
[55:49] the person that actually sits down and
[55:51] reads and learns uses my own brain so
[55:53] like kids have a problem with finding
[55:55] the credible
[55:57] thinker and I think that's one big thing
[55:59] too is all the credibility is messed up
[56:03] CU for some reason now kids think a
[56:06] credible person is a person that has a
[56:09] lot of likes or a lot of following and
[56:12] that's just simply not true that's uh
[56:14] that's a really interesting one because
[56:16] I I feel like uh um they they they
[56:20] project all the negative things that
[56:23] they should project on fear uh m Fiat uh
[56:27] they project on bitcoin like that
[56:30] someone else gets you out of their money
[56:32] like we know Fiat is like you don't
[56:34] really own it uh someone is stealing
[56:36] your purchasing power so it's it's
[56:38] interesting how how it goes and uh but
[56:41] it's a very I think a very bullish thing
[56:44] that everyone knows Bitcoin like with
[56:47] our with our generation there is no one
[56:50] in there that not at least heard about
[56:53] Bitcoin uh and then uh when they are now
[56:57] let's say
[56:59] 15 and they already saw that all the
[57:02] price shoots up and then they're 15 and
[57:03] then they're getting to like 21 22 23
[57:07] and then they seeing again like the the
[57:09] adoption rate of Bitcoin and the price
[57:11] going up then yeah if 21 they're like oh
[57:14] Bitcoin is there for forever and why
[57:16] should you not get some because um you
[57:20] you are 15 so you
[57:22] are are you younger or older than
[57:24] Bitcoin because uh is right around that
[57:27] that time right I was
[57:30] born I'm not going to say the same year
[57:33] because there's no re I was born right
[57:34] around it within the few years so I'm
[57:36] like the same age pretty
[57:38] much not any younger or older so so you
[57:43] so you grew up in a world where there
[57:46] was always Bitcoin which is an amazing
[57:48] thing that you like always were in a
[57:51] Bitcoin world even though we don't live
[57:53] on a Bitcoin standard but yeah there was
[57:55] always Bitcoin my mom actually had when
[57:58] she was in college had a friend that was
[58:01] a nerd a computer nerd how is she
[58:03] classified I'm not in a mean way I don't
[58:05] use nerd as a mean term at all so I hope
[58:08] all your listeners understand that not
[58:10] in a mean way but some person that was
[58:13] into computers and into code and she
[58:16] told me stories about him telling her
[58:19] hey you should look at this Bitcoin
[58:20] thing it's pretty cool the
[58:22] cryptocurrency and of course it was
[58:24] thought of as a cryptocurrency cuz
[58:25] that's what it was
[58:27] and the technology uses was crypto and
[58:30] she was actually convinced she was going
[58:32] to buy it and like I think like 2012 or
[58:36] something and then that the first time
[58:39] she was going to buy it she had to meet
[58:40] up with somebody and the McDonald's
[58:42] parking lot and give them $500 in return
[58:45] for a piece of paper that had the
[58:48] supposed information on it which that
[58:49] sounds pretty sketchy there was no way
[58:52] else she could have bought it back then
[58:55] that's what she told me at Le it
[58:56] probably was but like that was the first
[58:58] time she was going to buy it and
[59:00] then the next time there was ways you
[59:03] could buy exchanges but then she thought
[59:05] it was too late and then the next time
[59:08] and then the next time and then finally
[59:09] she got it in like 2020 yeah I think
[59:12] it's pretty crazy that my mom did hear
[59:13] of it back whenever it was first
[59:16] out and I'm very glad I am a part of
[59:20] Bitcoin and this community that's just
[59:23] so great for everybody's future in the
[59:25] High Time prefer
[59:27] amazing I love our interview already a
[59:29] lot um let's come now to the end routin
[59:31] of of our podcast um first question of
[59:34] the end routine what can we learn from
[59:36] you besides all the things that we
[59:38] already talked about okay one big thing
[59:42] eat
[59:43] healthy and
[59:45] don't think that somebody won't be lying
[59:49] just because they're a credible doctor
[59:51] or expert about food meat is very good I
[59:56] love beef very much and I think getting
[59:59] properly grass-fed beef is very
[60:01] important and food is a very big thing I
[60:04] think food is directly connected to
[60:06] Fiat like obesity rates are going very
[60:10] very very high in America and I think
[60:13] that's because the food is basically
[60:14] Fiat like big example I could say is you
[60:17] could grab a box of cereal for like
[60:20] $5 at the store it used to be like a
[60:23] dollar like I remember like five years
[60:24] ago it was a dollar but now it's $5
[60:26] magically or six for a big box of cereal
[60:28] that has like a total of 6,000 calories
[60:31] you could eat that for like 2 three days
[60:33] and be full and be perfectly fine and
[60:36] think oh yeah that's fine I $6 on food
[60:39] for a few days when then a piece of beef
[60:43] could be like $30 for feeding two or
[60:47] three people and it's very expensive but
[60:51] it's real food I think food is a very
[60:53] important thing that people just start
[60:54] looking at taking care of your health
[60:57] staying in decent shape you don't have
[60:59] to be a crazy athlete or wrestle or play
[61:02] football but I think everybody should be
[61:04] staying in shape being able to use their
[61:08] body it just keeps your brain healthy
[61:09] that's one thing that's a that's an
[61:12] amazing amazing uh learning that you got
[61:15] us here um uh our end routin now is
[61:19] where the previous guest is asking a
[61:20] question uh for the next guest without
[61:22] knowing who the next guest actually is
[61:24] and the question is a very long one
[61:26] so I might have to explain it after I
[61:28] read it a little bit um would you rather
[61:31] have all the shitcoins built on top of
[61:36] Bitcoin but
[61:38] Bitcoin has one the store of value
[61:41] narrative
[61:43] or uh there are no shitcoins built on
[61:46] top of Bitcoin but Bitcoin is only going
[61:50] to be used as a niche currency among a
[61:52] small group of people I may we may have
[61:55] to break down that question a little bit
[61:57] for my non wordy brain I'm not very good
[62:01] with understanding reading questions if
[62:03] I'm being honest but if I'm
[62:06] understanding the question correctly
[62:08] you're saying would I rather have
[62:10] Bitcoin be how it is with a small group
[62:14] or all the shitcoins be added onto it
[62:20] with it being adopted around the world
[62:23] is that correct yeah it's exactly
[62:25] correct because there's a lot of um uh
[62:28] discussions around like def things and
[62:31] shitcoins and mem coins and ordinal on
[62:33] top of Bitcoin and that that's what I
[62:35] mean with or what that's what the
[62:37] previous guest meant with uh uh
[62:40] shitcoins built on top of Bitcoin being
[62:42] honest the first thing that goes in my
[62:44] brain which I'm not very techy I don't
[62:46] really know what the new bad coins are
[62:50] or the new exchanges that match the two
[62:53] together or I don't even I'm trying to
[62:56] follow how people are building on
[62:57] bitcoin but of course I can't keep up
[62:59] with all the tech stuff that well it's
[63:01] just a
[63:02] lot but if you change the fundamentals
[63:05] of Bitcoin then it's no longer Bitcoin
[63:08] so I would say keep it in the small
[63:10] group then and hope that group grows if
[63:13] if it changes somehow to really bad and
[63:18] follows how shitcoins go and people just
[63:21] build upon it and everybody switches the
[63:25] how it works
[63:26] and sides towards the other coins I
[63:28] think that would be equal
[63:31] to uh nothing it wouldn't be Bitcoin
[63:34] anymore so I have to keep it upon the
[63:36] small group like you could say Bitcoin
[63:38] is a small group right now it's going
[63:40] pretty good like it's less than 1% of
[63:42] the world owns it I think and it's going
[63:46] pretty great so I think it could only go
[63:48] up from a small group but if you mess it
[63:51] up permanently it can only go down so I
[63:54] would say keep it a small group I love
[63:56] that answer a lot because uh it shows
[63:59] that it's it's pure thing like we it's
[64:02] it's more valuable to have Bitcoin as a
[64:05] pure thing uh and not have Bitcoin
[64:09] diluted in in something else because
[64:11] then Bitcoin might not be that but there
[64:13] are a lot of uh variables and a lot of
[64:15] things uh coming into that but it's an
[64:17] really interesting uh question to think
[64:20] about and I appreciate that answer so um
[64:23] before I let you go Ben where can people
[64:25] find where can people ask you questions
[64:27] you can find me on
[64:29] Twitter at um
[64:32] jz4
[64:34] BTC and where else could somebody find
[64:38] me you can hopefully see me at Bitcoin
[64:42] conferences in the future because I'm
[64:43] trying to get funding and find a way to
[64:45] get out there because I love meeting
[64:47] people in person much more than online
[64:49] but I'd say mainly Twitter is the big
[64:53] one jenzy for the number four BTC it's
[64:57] on my shirt but my shirt's pretty
[65:00] low down and my mom also helps run that
[65:04] account she has it on her phone as well
[65:07] so don't be afraid if you are an adult
[65:10] it's not weird cuz my mom runs it as
[65:11] well I'm still a minor so don't worry
[65:14] about that part of anything my mom helps
[65:17] me with all that don't worry I say
[65:18] that's where you can find me easily is
[65:21] there or maybe you run into me at a
[65:22] conference should be pretty
[65:24] cool I you in uh Amsterdam oh I am in
[65:29] Florida oh no no I'm I'm I'm talking
[65:32] about the Bitcoin conference in
[65:34] Amsterdam the because you you visited
[65:37] the magazine the Bitcoin magazine one in
[65:39] Nashville so I thought like maybe you're
[65:41] also in in Bitcoin
[65:42] Amsterdam I when is that I don't think
[65:45] I'm going I have limited ones I can go
[65:47] to as of right now because we don't have
[65:49] the most money to get out there my mom
[65:52] can't miss that much work but I don't
[65:55] think I'm going to Hamsterdam yeah I'm
[65:59] just asking because uh I will probably
[66:01] be there uh in in it's October in but
[66:05] it's Europe it's a It's a Long Way Drive
[66:07] for for you I guess um or drive a fly
[66:11] long long it be cool if I could go but I
[66:13] don't think I'd be able to make it out
[66:15] of country yet I have to be a little bit
[66:17] older or I don't have to be older but I
[66:19] mean like I we would have to find out
[66:23] ways to get there CU we have to save up
[66:25] for about a year to go to each
[66:27] conference so like last one we went to
[66:29] was Miami and then we went to Nashville
[66:32] so then I'm trying to go to
[66:34] Vegas for the next one the next big one
[66:37] in Vegas I think it's at in the big dome
[66:40] and I think that would be really cool
[66:41] and if I could go to anymore and get
[66:43] ways to get out there and fly I would
[66:46] 100% go and that would be very cool but
[66:49] we have to figure out how to do that
[66:50] which maybe maybe I can figure it out
[66:53] I'm not sure I'll be looking at Twitter
[66:55] seeing what I can do see what strings I
[66:57] can pull so I really really just love
[66:59] getting out getting to talk to people
[67:00] and spread the word and find projects to
[67:03] work on and the main thing is helping my
[67:06] generation and even young adults figure
[67:09] out Bitcoin and figure out there's a
[67:10] better option it's just like such a deep
[67:12] thing Bitcoin it's crazy word I think
[67:15] you you you will succeed with that I
[67:17] think you will be very successful with
[67:19] with that and you will get out to a lot
[67:20] of conferences uh I have a good feeling
[67:23] about that yeah thank you so much that
[67:24] is my my goal for my short-term goal as
[67:28] we talk about in my little Trading Group
[67:30] about making goals for your life is to
[67:34] be able to fly out to a few conferences
[67:37] a year and talk on stage about my
[67:40] generation and put importance into
[67:42] creating good content for people my age
[67:45] to learn and know is what I want to do
[67:48] is get out some conferences and start
[67:50] doing that but I think would be very
[67:51] nice perfect then thank you so much for
[67:54] for taking the time Ben also thank you
[67:56] so much everyone that is listening and
[67:58] watching uh for joining us today as
[68:00] always I'll be back tomorrow with
