[00:00] Money comes about by people choosing the
[00:02] best way to economize. And Satoshi was
[00:06] so brilliant in leaving him, her
[00:09] themselves out of the picture because
[00:11] one thing they understood was that in
[00:14] order for Bitcoin to be money that it
[00:16] cannot be created by anyone. We will
[00:19] always have a need to exchange value no
[00:22] matter what system we're operating in.
[00:24] We are the decision makers. We have
[00:27] employed a government because we think
[00:29] that is a better way to be productive as
[00:32] a society. But we generated that. The
[00:35] hardest part of understanding the system
[00:38] that we live in is where do you get the
[00:40] right information about understanding
[00:42] the system we live. It is no value
[00:45] without a medium of exchange. The medium
[00:47] of exchange has to come first.
[00:49] Everyone's hodddling Bitcoin. It's
[00:51] wonderful. Let's hodddle to the moon.
[00:53] But there will be no moon if we do not
[00:55] transact. If we all do that on our local
[00:58] level, then eventually we create mass
[01:01] adoption.
[01:04] [Music]
[01:06] Before we get started, uh, give us a
[01:09] brief overview of who you are and why
[01:11] you're excited about Bitcoin. Robin, I
[01:14] am just your everyday average working
[01:18] hardworking person who is trying to find
[01:21] a way to better myself and be the most
[01:24] productive person I can in society. And
[01:27] I think that a lot of people can
[01:29] probably relate to that story. I'm not
[01:32] an economist. I am not a finance guy. I
[01:35] am not your financial tech guru of any
[01:39] sort. I am just a guy that happened to
[01:42] stumble across Bitcoin in my everyday
[01:46] journeys of being on YouTube. You know,
[01:49] uh YouTube has become a university for
[01:52] me in my search for how to better myself
[01:58] in what I now know as the substitute
[02:01] money system. So, I found Bitcoin in
[02:05] 2017 and since then I've just been on a
[02:10] journey to understanding the system that
[02:14] we live in and why Bitcoin is a better
[02:19] money. Um, so that has literally been my
[02:23] focus and from this field you understand
[02:27] that there is a lot of misinformation
[02:32] So the hardest part of understanding the
[02:36] system that we live in is where do you
[02:38] get the right information about
[02:40] understanding the system we live in.
[02:43] I I get that. Yeah. There's so much
[02:45] noise out there in in in in the field
[02:48] especially in finance there is like I
[02:50] think Bitcoin only if you have a Bitcoin
[02:53] only content creator they're usually
[02:55] like there's a lot of high signal but if
[02:58] you go out on crypto maybe you go out
[03:01] even further with like finance in
[03:03] general you find a lot of noise and it's
[03:06] really hard to see what kind of
[03:08] information is out there but even on
[03:10] Bitcoin only there's like a lot of
[03:11] different informations out there there's
[03:13] a lot of noise and and uh uh different
[03:15] signals out there. It's it's hard like
[03:18] finding the right right information and
[03:21] and and who to trust and who not to
[03:23] trust. It's it's it's a it's a long
[03:25] process. You have to listen to so many
[03:26] people and then you're like at some
[03:28] point you figure out oh like those two
[03:30] like are [ __ ] Those two maybe are
[03:32] trustworthy. Uh I I can understand.
[03:35] Yeah. Exactly. and coming to understand
[03:39] Bitcoin and a system of don't trust and
[03:43] verify. My practice has now been
[03:47] whatever information that I think that
[03:49] I'm getting from this source is good, I
[03:51] want to verify with another source and
[03:54] then I want to verify with another
[03:56] source and then I want to proof check it
[03:58] with another source so that I can come
[04:00] to my own conclusion on what is the
[04:03] right information. So we take bits and
[04:05] pieces of information from here, from
[04:08] there, and we piece it all together
[04:10] until it starts to make sense. And the
[04:12] process is long because this fiduciary
[04:16] media system, as Ron Me likes to put it,
[04:20] cuz I am on my Austrian economics
[04:22] journey, um, is quite complicated and
[04:27] complex and intentionally designed.
[04:31] So to navigate your way through, thank
[04:34] God for Bitcoin for making it clear and
[04:37] precise how money should work, you know.
[04:41] Um, so that is where I am right now and
[04:45] I have come to the understanding
[04:48] that money is not
[04:51] invented. Money comes about by people
[04:55] choosing the best way to economize. And
[04:58] Satoshi was so
[05:00] brilliant in leaving him, her themselves
[05:05] out of the picture because one thing
[05:07] they understood was that in order for
[05:10] Bitcoin to be money that it cannot be
[05:13] created by anyone. It just has to be
[05:17] accepted by many different places at
[05:21] different times that we'll all come to
[05:23] an understanding that Bitcoin is a more
[05:28] marketable salailable commodity to use,
[05:33] especially as a medium of
[05:36] exchange. And because it is so great as
[05:39] a medium of
[05:41] exchange, it
[05:43] coincidentally has a magnificent store
[05:47] of value. And that is a narrative that
[05:50] it has taken me a long time to
[05:53] understand because a lot of the
[05:56] information and what we hear first about
[05:59] Bitcoin is that it is the best store of
[06:02] value. And indeed it is without a doubt.
[06:06] But we haven't really spent a lot of
[06:09] time talking about why Bitcoin is the
[06:12] best store of value. The real reason why
[06:14] Bitcoin is the best store of value. And
[06:17] that reason is simply because it is the
[06:20] best medium of
[06:21] exchange. But we have not crossed the
[06:24] line where we're actively using Bitcoin
[06:27] as the best medium of exchange.
[06:30] And me being here on the
[06:33] ground, I am taking the social layer of
[06:38] Bitcoin and dowing into my social
[06:40] economy to engage more people in my
[06:44] community, in my surroundings to ensure
[06:47] them that there is a better way than
[06:50] operating in the substitute money system
[06:53] that we have.
[06:55] Bitcoin allows you to see from outside
[06:59] the system what it looks
[07:02] like and it takes a minute to get
[07:05] there but from what I understand is that
[07:08] it starts somewhere and for those who
[07:12] have a better understanding of how the
[07:15] technology works and why it is such a
[07:18] better source of money and medium of
[07:20] exchange. Those are the people that we
[07:23] need to learn from. Those are the people
[07:25] who can lead by
[07:27] example because Cole Manger teaches us
[07:30] that the best way for money to
[07:35] rise is by
[07:38] observation. So we can only observe
[07:42] those who are in a economic position to
[07:47] use Bitcoin as a better form of money.
[07:50] The store value is absolutely fantastic.
[07:54] It's a wonderful
[07:55] idea, but I don't think many of us have
[07:59] really
[08:00] considered how many people can use
[08:02] Bitcoin as a store of
[08:04] value. You know, we we we talk all the
[08:07] time about the unbanked population and
[08:10] how there's a large percentage of the
[08:12] world that is completely unbanked. Well,
[08:15] we know that these people are unbanked,
[08:17] but for some reason we haven't pieced
[08:19] together that yeah, these people are
[08:22] unbanked and the next level after, you
[08:25] know, being banked would be saving. So,
[08:28] if these people are unbanked, the idea
[08:31] of using Bitcoin as a store of value is
[08:35] just no nowhere near the forefront.
[08:40] So we have to get to a point
[08:43] where we understand that Bitcoin is the
[08:46] medium of exchange, the better medium of
[08:50] exchange. Everyone can interact and
[08:53] transact with Bitcoin as a medium of
[08:56] exchange. But not everyone can transact
[09:00] and store Bitcoin as value. Not everyone
[09:04] has that privilege. Not everyone has
[09:07] obtained that level of wealth where they
[09:10] can store Bitcoin as
[09:13] value. But we all can use Bitcoin as a
[09:17] medium of
[09:18] exchange. So we have to get that
[09:21] narrative out there if we want Bitcoin
[09:25] to be the medium of exchange that allows
[09:28] us to have that unlimited infinite store
[09:32] of value. That's where we got to get to.
[09:35] That that's a super great point of of
[09:37] like um a lot of pe like everyone can
[09:40] use it as a mean exchange but not
[09:42] everyone can use it as a store of value
[09:44] because there are a lot of people that
[09:46] just live from yeah from from month to
[09:50] month they don't they don't have
[09:52] something check to check day to day I
[09:56] mean we really have to consider
[09:59] everyone you know not everyone has the
[10:03] privilege of delving into fiduciary
[10:06] media products such as MSTR and
[10:09] GameStop. You know, that is a privilege
[10:12] to be able to navigate your way through
[10:16] a substitute money system and increase
[10:19] your value in the substitute money. That
[10:22] is a privilege.
[10:25] Everyone needs to transact some form of
[10:29] commodity as a medium of exchange just
[10:31] to survive to consume their everyday
[10:34] needs to fulfill their economic
[10:37] purposes. Everyone needs that. Not
[10:41] everyone has the level to store that
[10:43] value. But if we really want to get
[10:45] there, we have to push this narrative
[10:47] that Bitcoin needs to be used as a
[10:51] medium of exchange. You know, we cannot
[10:54] say it enough. It is the best form of
[10:56] money. We have spent over a
[11:01] century over a
[11:03] century delving into and exploring all
[11:07] the ways and advantages to use
[11:11] substitute money.
[11:13] Okay.
[11:15] 1913 was the beginning of where we are
[11:20] right now in history. If the US dollar
[11:23] as the reserve currency being
[11:27] controlled by a small select group of
[11:32] people, you know, Cole Manger teaches us
[11:36] that money was invented by no one, not a
[11:40] legislative
[11:41] act, but simply as a
[11:45] need to exchange value.
[11:49] We will always have a need to exchange
[11:52] value no matter what system we're
[11:55] operating in. If humans are to survive,
[11:59] if humans are to thrive, we must
[12:02] economize. We must exchange
[12:05] value on all levels, everyone. And then
[12:09] once we figure out the best exchange of
[12:13] value on our own
[12:15] time by examples of others
[12:19] showing them
[12:23] exchanging and being more
[12:25] productive, having a better means to
[12:28] exchange it value. When others lead by
[12:31] that example, more and more
[12:34] people will come to understand what is
[12:37] the better way to
[12:40] economize. Because just like humans,
[12:43] animals, we all need three things to
[12:46] survive. Sleep, water, and food. And
[12:50] that's nothing no one has to teach us.
[12:52] We don't have to ask the government
[12:54] legislation when to sleep, when should
[12:57] we eat, when should we drink. So we
[13:00] certainly can't ask them when should we
[13:03] economize, how should we
[13:05] economize, what means should we use to
[13:09] economize. That is up to the people. But
[13:11] for some reason the people have
[13:13] forgotten. We have forgotten that life
[13:16] and existence and purpose is up to us.
[13:21] We are the decision makers. We have
[13:23] employed a
[13:25] government because we think that is a
[13:27] better way to be productive as a
[13:30] society. But we generated
[13:33] that. We chose representatives from our
[13:38] communities to represent our interests.
[13:42] So we must clearly display what our
[13:45] interests
[13:46] are and then allow our representatives
[13:49] to represent our
[13:51] interests. But they cannot represent our
[13:55] interests by just theory of talking
[13:58] about it of ideology without
[14:01] practice. We need to practice the
[14:04] interest that we want to be represented.
[14:08] And I understand that taxes is a huge
[14:11] concern, but I'm okay with that. If my
[14:14] government wants to tax me because I've
[14:16] decided to transact in
[14:18] Bitcoin to buy coffee, to buy a t-shirt,
[14:23] to buy something
[14:25] online, so be it. We're going to get to
[14:28] a point where I'm hoping that enough
[14:30] people will make these same
[14:31] transactions and the government will
[14:34] have to change their mind about the
[14:35] decisions they make because we the
[14:37] people are who they represent. And if we
[14:40] the people have decided on our own
[14:44] accord without the influence of
[14:47] any central body that Bitcoin is the
[14:51] better means to transact and exchange
[14:54] our
[14:55] values then we the people have that
[14:58] choice to make and no one can tell us we
[15:00] cannot. Telling me that I cannot
[15:02] economize in the best way I see fit is
[15:05] like telling me that I cannot eat, sleep
[15:07] or breathe. Love that. And I I never I
[15:10] never understood that argument of taxes
[15:12] because people always bring it up. Oh,
[15:14] but then you pay so many taxes. And for
[15:17] me, the flip side of that is if you say
[15:20] you have let's say 90% in Bitcoin and
[15:23] 10% in fiat and with that 10% you
[15:27] transact in the fiat world. So you don't
[15:31] pay taxes when you uh sell fiat
[15:34] basically when you spend uh money and
[15:38] when you then go ahead and go all in
[15:40] bitcoin. So you have 100% in bitcoin
[15:43] then you pay taxes on the bitcoin that
[15:45] you sell but you only pay taxes on the
[15:49] profits. So the you you made more money
[15:55] than you would have made when you just
[15:59] held on to the
[16:02] field. So in order to pay taxes, you
[16:05] have to make a profit from that. So
[16:08] you're
[16:09] actually not losing anything. you're
[16:12] actually gaining value from that because
[16:15] you don't pay taxes on a loss or like
[16:18] some some something like that, right?
[16:21] We're not paying taxes on a loss. So,
[16:24] yes. So, that's why the best way to, you
[16:27] know, get into Bitcoin is to dollar cost
[16:30] average your way, right? So that you
[16:33] know, one day you buy Bitcoin at the
[16:36] top, one day it's a little bit down. So
[16:38] you have a nice weighted average of the
[16:41] value of your Bitcoin so that you can
[16:44] transact and not really have to worry
[16:46] about what the taxes or fees were. you
[16:50] know, I'm I'm going to leave that to
[16:52] those who decide that it's worth the
[16:54] process of taxing me to figure out that
[16:58] debt. I am going to just choose a better
[17:01] money to transact in because I
[17:04] understand that this is a better way for
[17:06] me to value myself. This is a better way
[17:09] for me to be productive and economize in
[17:12] the best way that I see fit, which every
[17:15] man has the right to choose. This is
[17:17] where we have to understand it's a
[17:20] wonderful narrative. We always hear the
[17:22] story Bitcoin is the best store of
[17:24] value. You know, yes, it is truly the
[17:28] best store of value, but it is not the
[17:32] best store of value without a medium of
[17:35] exchange. It is not the best store of
[17:37] value without a medium of exchange. It
[17:40] is no value without a medium of
[17:43] exchange. The medium of exchange has to
[17:45] come first.
[17:48] Now, I understand the way Bitcoin
[17:50] technology works, we had to mint
[17:52] Bitcoin, but I don't think it was an
[17:55] accident that
[17:57] Satoshi released half of the supply of
[18:01] Bitcoin within the first four
[18:03] years because Satoshi
[18:06] understood that in order for Bitcoin to
[18:09] be
[18:10] successful, it had to be a medium of
[18:13] exchange. And it couldn't be a medium of
[18:15] exchange releasing 5%. You know, we had
[18:18] to release a significant
[18:21] amount. And he stated once a
[18:24] predetermined amount of
[18:26] Bitcoin has been
[18:29] minted, the validators can survive off
[18:33] of transaction fees. While I understand
[18:36] right now that there's not a lot of
[18:38] transaction fees, and that's because we
[18:40] aren't using Bitcoin as a medium of
[18:42] exchange.
[18:44] You know, everyone's hodddling Bitcoin.
[18:46] It's wonderful. Let's hodddle to the
[18:48] moon. But there will be no moon if we do
[18:51] not
[18:54] transact, you know. So, so right now,
[18:57] Bitcoin is a wonderful
[19:00] uh store of value against time. Bitcoin
[19:04] has risen as it has hedged against
[19:08] inflation over time. But we have not
[19:11] seen the true value of the Bitcoin
[19:15] network. As your as one of your guests
[19:18] we recently had on from Nigeria stated
[19:20] very clearly, the net worth is in the
[19:24] network. So if we don't use the net
[19:27] worth, the net worth will be a slow slow
[19:32] slow low time preference game. So I have
[19:37] a low time
[19:38] preference but at the same time I think
[19:41] that the time preference for Bitcoin
[19:44] would be a little more you know faster
[19:48] if we had the Bitcoin use as a medium of
[19:51] exchange on the rise. We have the
[19:54] company. I don't know if you've heard of
[19:55] Steak and Shake uh here in America,
[19:59] right? So, Steak and Shake did a
[20:01] wonderful uh remarkable thing. You know,
[20:04] them allowing payments in Bitcoin is a
[20:08] definite game changer. So now if we can
[20:12] get more big companies that service the
[20:15] public that have hundreds of millions of
[20:17] customers to allow Bitcoin as a medium
[20:20] of exchange then we can get to the next
[20:23] level which is the most important level
[20:26] that medium of
[20:27] exchange you know and then we can all
[20:30] delve into the other aspects of Bitcoin
[20:34] and really focusing in on things such as
[20:37] mining and getting everyone to educate
[20:40] themselves on the Bitcoin
[20:43] technology. So, what I'm doing is
[20:46] working with people such as the uh
[20:49] Matteo and the Orange Pill app, working
[20:52] on the social layer of Bitcoin because
[20:55] we have to build our social economy and
[20:58] understanding where Bitcoin is and how
[21:02] we get the Bitcoin to be the medium of
[21:03] exchange. So, within my social grouping,
[21:07] I am using Bitcoin. I am telling other
[21:10] people to use Bitcoin, find ways to
[21:13] transact in Bitcoin. If we all do that
[21:17] on our local level, then eventually we
[21:21] create mass
[21:23] adoption. But if we don't do that, the
[21:27] mass adoption may never come.
[21:30] And I understand on the technical side
[21:33] there may be issues with Bitcoin
[21:36] scalability, but I think we're at a
[21:38] point now where we can test out how much
[21:41] scalability we really have on
[21:43] Bitcoin. Let's test it out. If we're
[21:46] waiting for the Nimmer to go up and then
[21:49] transaction fees have become extremely
[21:51] expensive and then people then the
[21:54] onboarding cost becomes much more
[21:56] expensive for people to get into
[21:58] Bitcoin. No, we don't want to wait for
[22:00] the number to go up and for it be harder
[22:02] for people to get into Bitcoin. We need
[22:04] onboarding now. We need more people
[22:06] adopting Bitcoin and transacting in
[22:09] Bitcoin now. And let's allow the number
[22:12] to go up because we're processing more
[22:16] transactions. There are more people
[22:18] using Bitcoin. And let's see what
[22:20] Bitcoin scalability looks like. Let's
[22:23] see how many people decide to use
[22:25] Lightning. Let's see how many people
[22:27] decide to use things like Cashew and
[22:29] Fedam. Let's see how far we can go with
[22:33] the scalability options that we have
[22:36] now. But if we're telling everybody to
[22:39] just store Bitcoin as value, we're not
[22:42] going to get
[22:43] there. 95% of the supply is released.
[22:47] What are we waiting for? 96, 97,
[22:51] 98.3? What's the number? Let's use
[22:54] Bitcoin.
[22:58] That's a that's a really interesting
[23:00] really interesting perspective. It's
[23:03] Would you say it's ethically wrong to
[23:06] pay people in in fiat because we know
[23:08] how bad feat is. Robin, you've just
[23:11] opened up another can of
[23:13] worms. Bitcoin has led me to
[23:17] understand what money really is. Robin,
[23:20] for the last 100
[23:22] years, no one on planet Earth has been
[23:26] living and operating in real
[23:29] money. There's those who have stored
[23:32] gold as a value of
[23:34] money. But every human being that I know
[23:37] economizes,
[23:39] studies, creates debt, tries to find all
[23:43] different kinds of ways to
[23:45] thrive in a substitute money system. And
[23:49] the reason it is a substitute money
[23:52] system is because it has no ability to
[23:56] store value. There has been absolutely
[23:59] zero
[24:00] value created in the money substitute
[24:04] system.
[24:06] What has been created is better ways of
[24:10] obtaining substitute
[24:13] money through fiduciary media
[24:16] products such as
[24:19] MSTR. Wonderful idea. I don't have a
[24:22] problem with it. Let's build the
[24:23] substitute money so that we can transfer
[24:27] it to real money. The most usable real
[24:30] money. The most salailable real money.
[24:33] There's only one and it's not gold. Gold
[24:36] has been a wonderful ancient historic
[24:40] store of value, but it in no way does it
[24:44] compare to the Bitcoin technology.
[24:48] I understand that is a great way to
[24:51] translate how Bitcoin works to people by
[24:55] using gold as a reference, but Bitcoin
[24:58] is far more
[25:00] superior, far more use
[25:04] cases than gold ever had. So, and
[25:07] indeed, Bitcoin is the most salailable
[25:12] commodity to use as a medium of
[25:15] exchange. And those that know
[25:19] that and
[25:21] continue to push the
[25:24] narrative of
[25:26] operating in substitute
[25:29] money and continue to find
[25:33] ways to sell people products in
[25:36] substitute money. I'm not
[25:39] sure what kind of people they are.
[25:43] I'm not sure if I would classify them as
[25:47] honest
[25:50] humanitarians, good people because
[25:52] Bitcoin makes it very
[25:54] clear what a good person is.
[25:57] Trustworthy,
[26:00] verifiable. I trust because I can
[26:02] verify. open, not
[26:05] authoritative, allowing
[26:07] everyone to make their own choices and
[26:10] not looking for ways to cancel people
[26:15] for making
[26:16] choices that are not of the greater
[26:21] consensus.
[26:23] So all of the
[26:25] people that
[26:27] spend thousands and countless of hours,
[26:30] days, and lifetimes
[26:34] studying hundreds of thousands of
[26:36] dollars going to Ivy League institutions
[26:39] to learn how to operate in a broken
[26:43] money
[26:44] system. Now, I understand if you didn't
[26:47] understand the system and you're just
[26:50] following along. You're just observing
[26:52] the best way to
[26:54] economize because that's what we do as
[26:56] humans. We observe the best way to
[26:59] economize and then we make those
[27:01] decisions on how to practice those best
[27:05] ways to economize. So for those that did
[27:08] not know any better, they made an honest
[27:12] conscious decision decision to study all
[27:16] of these substitute money projects to
[27:19] learn all of this substitute money
[27:21] terminology to become extremely
[27:24] knowledgeable and educated in the
[27:26] substitute money system. I'm sorry for
[27:28] those people and I hope they take the
[27:31] time to learn Bitcoin and learn that
[27:34] there is a better
[27:35] way and it's going to be people like me
[27:38] and you and having conversations like
[27:41] this and having conversations of
[27:44] personal face to face on a local
[27:47] level to explain there is a better way
[27:51] to economize to show there is a better
[27:55] way to economize. But then for that
[27:57] particular group of people who are
[28:00] choosing to push this
[28:02] narrative of
[28:05] operating in this broken substitute
[28:08] money system, well, Bitcoin is letting
[28:10] me know who you are. I know who you are.
[28:14] I can see clearly the kind of person you
[28:17] are. And then on top of
[28:19] that, you have a select few that have
[28:23] not only chosen to push the narrative of
[28:25] the of the substitute money, but then
[28:29] tell
[28:30] you that they wouldn't touch Bitcoin,
[28:34] that Bitcoin is a bad idea, that it's
[28:37] going to
[28:38] zero. and having the
[28:41] knowledge of
[28:43] knowing exactly why Bitcoin is a better
[28:46] option. I can see those people. Bitcoin
[28:49] has allowed me to see straight through
[28:52] them. You know, from Jason Lowry's
[28:56] standpoint, you know, the software
[29:00] aspect of
[29:01] Bitcoin, it is about the survival of the
[29:04] fittest and the strongest. At some point
[29:07] you will choose to survive and thrive on
[29:11] Bitcoin because it is the better option
[29:13] to economize. You will have no choice.
[29:16] We're not We only need a certain amount
[29:19] of
[29:20] people to start using
[29:23] Bitcoin. And once the engagement begins
[29:26] on that small level where enough people
[29:30] can
[29:32] observe that Bitcoin is the better
[29:35] option to transact
[29:37] in at that point they don't even know.
[29:39] They don't even need to know that it's
[29:41] 21 million or 2.1 quadrillion as the new
[29:44] conversation is
[29:46] unveiling. They don't even need to know
[29:48] that. They need to know one thing that
[29:50] Bitcoin is the more salailable commodity
[29:52] for a medium of exchange. And if I want
[29:54] to economize and if I want to consume
[29:58] things for my life and myself, I better
[30:01] use the most salailable medium of
[30:03] exchange or I'm not going to have many
[30:05] options to economize. That's where we're
[30:08] going with this.
[30:09] That's that that's a really good good
[30:12] insight. I think it's like super
[30:14] interesting to see Bitcoin as a medium
[30:18] of exchange
[30:19] first and you're well aware of Jeff Bof
[30:23] uh and he was I think the first one on
[30:26] my channel that said if Bitcoin fails as
[30:28] a medium of exchange it will also fail
[30:30] as a store of value which was a big
[30:32] statement and previously I always
[30:35] thought that store of value is required
[30:39] so that we can move on to medium of
[30:41] exchange later on. But maybe medium of
[30:44] exchange is the actual more important
[30:48] aspect of
[30:49] Bitcoin. So we can take away that fiat
[30:52] monopoly of legal tender. It's also
[30:55] interesting with the IMF and the El
[30:57] Salvador story. They're not
[31:01] as mad about El Salvador that they are
[31:04] stacking Bitcoin, but they're very mad
[31:07] on the Salvador that they have Bitcoin
[31:09] as legal tender. And I think we have to
[31:11] ask ourselves why why is that? Like why
[31:13] why do does the fiat system want the
[31:17] legal tender thing? Uh you can buy
[31:20] Bitcoin, but don't use it as a medium of
[31:22] exchange. That that that's bad, right?
[31:25] They're telling you do not use Bitcoin
[31:28] as a medium of exchange. If you use
[31:30] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, you're
[31:31] going to lose your money. But in the
[31:34] very same breath, they're not stopping
[31:36] you from transferring your substitute
[31:40] money into real
[31:42] money. And the reason that is is
[31:47] because never in the origins in the
[31:50] history of real money has it ever been
[31:54] created by any legislative
[31:56] act, by any government.
[32:00] Money has been chosen by the people and
[32:05] we've had multiple forms of money due to
[32:08] different cultures and society around
[32:10] the world and those groups of people
[32:13] chose the money that was best for their
[32:16] group of
[32:18] people. until we came to a point where
[32:22] we can now cross waters and borders to
[32:27] transact with people that were not a
[32:29] part of our
[32:31] group. And then we needed a better
[32:33] salailable medium of
[32:35] exchange. And that's how we led to
[32:38] gold because gold was a global medium of
[32:42] exchange that we could use. And the
[32:46] reason everyone stored gold is because
[32:49] they needed it as a medium of
[32:51] exchange. Robin, I was on the same point
[32:54] as you. Bitcoin is a store of value.
[32:56] Like I said, Robin, it really takes a
[32:59] lot of time and investigating and going
[33:04] back
[33:05] and to understand how money should work.
[33:10] And this is the most important subject
[33:13] in the world because every human does
[33:17] two
[33:18] things. They use
[33:20] energy and they use energy to economize.
[33:24] That is the boundaries of life. So if
[33:27] you don't understand how to use your
[33:30] energy in the most productive way to
[33:35] economize, you are enduring a dissatis
[33:39] dissatisfaction to yourself. You are not
[33:42] surviving and thriving in the world in
[33:45] the best way you can because you not you
[33:48] have not taken the time to understand
[33:52] the most important subject to all human
[33:55] beings and that is how to
[33:59] economize and what is the best way to
[34:03] transact amongst other human beings.
[34:06] What do we all
[34:09] value and then
[34:12] exchange and store that value to
[34:16] exchange for goods and services in the
[34:18] future. The government cannot tell us
[34:22] how and what that should be.
[34:25] What they can do is once we as the
[34:28] people have chosen and made a
[34:31] decision on our own terms on how we
[34:36] choose to economize, they can protect
[34:40] and represent our interests in the way
[34:43] that we want them to. So, we all have to
[34:46] come to an
[34:47] understanding of really what money is
[34:52] and how money should work. And it takes
[34:55] a lot. It really takes a lot because all
[34:58] of our systems, like Jeff Boo said, you
[35:01] know, they're they're wrong. The systems
[35:04] are wrong. And to Jeff Booth greatest
[35:07] point, the world should be deflationary.
[35:12] We're not living in a deflationary
[35:14] world. And the reason we're not living
[35:17] in a deflationary world is because we're
[35:19] operating on substitute money. We go to
[35:22] work. We spend our energy. We
[35:26] consume. We save. We do
[35:30] everything based on a substitute system.
[35:34] We have fully engaged.
[35:37] We have fully transferred all of our
[35:41] value into a substitute system which is
[35:45] devaluing us every
[35:48] day. The energy that we're using is
[35:51] being transferred to
[35:55] devaluation. You're working
[35:57] hard and your energy is being
[36:03] devalued, not stored. We want our energy
[36:07] to be stored. We're not We want our
[36:09] energy to
[36:11] survive. You know, that's the beautiful
[36:13] thing about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is alive
[36:15] just like humans. Why? Because it uses
[36:19] energy. Our proof of work is in the
[36:22] energy that we use. Bitcoin's proof of
[36:25] work is in the energy that it
[36:28] uses. Bitcoin is aligned with you. It is
[36:33] aligned with your energy. As you use
[36:35] your energy to prove your
[36:38] value, Bitcoin will use energy to store
[36:42] your
[36:43] value and allow you to transact in your
[36:47] value. One energy supports another
[36:49] energy. But we have to find a way to
[36:51] harness that energy and use it together.
[36:55] Because right now we are pulling our
[36:58] energy over here and we're using our
[37:01] energy for a substitute system and they
[37:04] don't go
[37:05] together. Our energy is being pulled
[37:08] down because a substitute system is
[37:11] piling on top of our energy and they
[37:14] just keep adding more and more and more
[37:18] of substitute supplies of fiduciary
[37:21] media. And they're not using much energy
[37:24] at all to create this substitute.
[37:26] They're
[37:27] using 10 seconds of electronic digital
[37:31] energy to create
[37:33] numbers out of thin
[37:35] air to devalue all of your hard working
[37:41] energy. The energy that you store every
[37:44] night when you rest. the energy that you
[37:47] store when you eat so that you can go
[37:50] out in the world and use that energy to
[37:53] be the most productive person that you
[37:55] can be. And all of your energy is being
[37:58] brought back to you in a substitute
[38:01] system.
[38:03] You're using your energy to for
[38:06] substitute supplies for supplies that
[38:09] will not last you for supplies that
[38:13] you're holding on to that is going down
[38:16] in value as you're storing it. It's
[38:20] leaking out of the bottom. There is a
[38:22] hole in your piggy bank at the bottom
[38:25] that you didn't
[38:26] see that all your energy that you're
[38:29] putting in is coming out. Bitcoin erases
[38:33] that. It allows you to keep your energy,
[38:38] to value your energy, to prove that you
[38:42] use all of this energy to create all of
[38:46] your value. And then you are
[38:48] allowed to exchange that
[38:52] energy with others, to exchange your
[38:57] value with
[38:58] others. in a form of energy that they
[39:02] also value, in a form of energy that
[39:05] they can also prove exist. Thank you for
[39:09] Bitcoin. But if we don't use it, we will
[39:13] lose it. And that's I love it. That's a
[39:15] catchphrase.
[39:17] That's it. That's the way it goes with
[39:20] anything. That's the way it goes with
[39:22] your body. If you don't use it, you will
[39:24] lose it. If you don't use your
[39:27] brain, it it starts to
[39:30] deteriorate. Your ability to think, your
[39:33] ability to process, your ability to
[39:35] retain
[39:37] information goes down because it's not
[39:40] being used. Let's take a break for a
[39:42] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[39:45] Coin Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[39:48] watches. Those watches are the most
[39:50] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[39:53] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[39:57] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[39:59] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[40:03] watch collections. You have the date of
[40:05] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[40:08] there. And of course, also the block
[40:10] height and which epoch we are currently
[40:14] in. I love the level of detail they put
[40:17] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[40:19] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[40:22] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[40:25] love those watches so so much. And now,
[40:28] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[40:30] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[40:32] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[40:34] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[40:36] first way is you put it on a hardware
[40:39] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[40:42] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[40:45] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[40:48] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[40:51] if you check out the link in the
[40:52] description, you even get 5% off if you
[40:55] use the code Robin. And the second way
[40:58] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[41:01] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[41:04] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[41:07] They will personalize for you a
[41:09] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[41:12] your individual situation. They will
[41:15] show you how you can secure your own
[41:17] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[41:20] enough. You also have to keep all your
[41:22] devices secure. One topic that is
[41:24] overlooked often is the inheritance
[41:26] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[41:29] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[41:32] a plan for that in place already? And
[41:34] last but not least, if you're in a
[41:36] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[41:39] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[41:41] that, head over to the
[41:45] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[41:48] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[41:51] be for the first time ever speaking at
[41:53] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[41:56] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[41:59] really looking forward to seeing all of
[42:01] you there. You can get your ticket in
[42:03] the link down in the description of
[42:05] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[42:08] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[42:11] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[42:13] there. Yeah, you have to think to learn
[42:15] how to think. You have to move to learn
[42:17] how to move and uh all of that. Exactly.
[42:21] The the question is always also for me
[42:23] like we we can't use Bitcoin so much
[42:27] right now. I mean we can use it um a
[42:30] little bit with so like how I do it
[42:32] right now is I earn actually most of my
[42:34] money already directly in bitcoin
[42:36] whatever 70% 60 80% whatever the the
[42:39] number is and only a small percentage uh
[42:43] I pay in bitcoin so uh only a small
[42:47] percentage I'm able to pay directly in
[42:49] bitcoin let's say I don't know 10 20%
[42:51] something like that this naturally
[42:54] forces me to sell bitcoin
[42:57] to use uh fiat as a mean of exchange
[43:00] because I have fiat bills that is just
[43:02] not there like I I just cannot pay pay
[43:04] them in bitcoin directly. So for me I
[43:07] want to pay everything in bitcoin
[43:10] because then I can operate on a bitcoin
[43:13] standard. I already earn in bitcoin. I
[43:15] already fulfill like the half of the
[43:17] requirements. I don't even have to buy
[43:19] it. I I earn it in bitcoin. But there's
[43:22] not too many merchants out there that I
[43:24] personally use uh do do that accept
[43:28] Bitcoin. Now the question for me is what
[43:30] do you think has to happen that more
[43:33] more merchants accepting Bitcoin? What
[43:36] is the the things that will trigger more
[43:39] and more merchants to say hey we we
[43:42] should adopt Bitcoin like stake and uh
[43:44] what was it uh shake and stake and shake
[43:47] something like that? Steak and shake. I
[43:49] know it uh it it's confusing because we
[43:52] also have another company called Shake
[43:54] Shack that's also kind of femin but it's
[43:57] steak is shake right. Um when I'm in
[43:59] Vegas next week I I I try to go to one.
[44:03] I is there one in Vegas? I believe there
[44:06] is one in Vegas. Yes. Uh I'm I'm in New
[44:09] York. So unfortunately we don't have one
[44:12] because I would have definitely been
[44:13] there on day one. So what we need,
[44:16] Robin, is we need more people who maybe
[44:20] run smaller businesses to start
[44:24] accepting
[44:25] Bitcoin. We need social
[44:28] uh economic communities that we're
[44:31] building to really like for example, I'm
[44:34] a personal trainer by day and I'm
[44:37] running my own business. So I'm trying
[44:40] to encourage my clients to pay me in
[44:43] Bitcoin. Now, I'm running a small
[44:45] operation, but that's where it starts.
[44:48] It starts from maybe individuals who are
[44:52] entrepreneurs who run small services and
[44:55] businesses to allow their clients or
[44:59] customers to pay in Bitcoin to advocate
[45:02] for them to pay in Bitcoin. You know, it
[45:05] starts small. You know, there right now,
[45:07] like I said, there are few we have a few
[45:09] places here in New York. Uh we have Pub
[45:11] Key. You know, I'm sure you've heard of
[45:13] Pub Key, so you can go there and spend
[45:16] your Bitcoin. Now, I understand maybe
[45:18] you're not into, you know, you know,
[45:20] going to a bar and having a beer, you
[45:22] know, so maybe that's not like your
[45:24] first choice or option to go and use
[45:27] Bitcoin. um you know but there are a few
[45:29] things like right now uh Bit Refill
[45:32] where you can buy uh prepaid um you know
[45:36] cards with your Bitcoin and then use
[45:40] those prepaid cards to you you know to
[45:43] pay for other things um with the
[45:45] substitute system you know so just try
[45:49] and find you know smaller ways to use
[45:53] Bitcoin transact sends you know we have
[45:57] places like Nostra and the Orange Pill
[46:00] app which is creating a magnificent uh
[46:03] lightning community um where you can
[46:06] send zaps you know everyone has a
[46:08] lightning wallet on the app and you can
[46:11] zap people you know so once we you know
[46:14] start transacting with your friends send
[46:17] them Bitcoin
[46:19] um find little small use cases and we
[46:23] have to do more orange peeling you know
[46:26] keep talking about Bitcoin within your
[46:29] circle and you know eventually it will
[46:34] slowly but start to grow. But right now
[46:37] I think we have start we have the what
[46:40] we really have to do right now is push
[46:42] the narrative of find ways to transact
[46:47] in Bitcoin because the main narrative
[46:50] that's in the front right now is Bitcoin
[46:52] is the best store of value. Yes, it is.
[46:56] But let's transact in Bitcoin. Bitcoin
[46:58] is the best money. Bitcoin is the best
[47:01] medium of exchange. We have to push that
[47:03] narrative. And when we start pushing
[47:05] that narrative, maybe more merchants
[47:08] will decide, you know what, why don't we
[47:11] add Bitcoin as a form of payment, you
[47:14] know, but right now we're pushing the
[47:16] narrative of the big Bitcoin is the best
[47:18] store of value. So maybe most of these
[47:20] people that have small businesses, hey,
[47:22] they're storing Bitcoin for value as for
[47:26] themselves. They haven't come to the
[47:29] notion that you know what, maybe I ought
[47:31] to allow my customers to pay in Bitcoin
[47:34] because if I allow my customers to pay
[47:36] in Bitcoin, my store value will have
[47:39] greater
[47:40] value. If GameStop could come to that
[47:44] narrative with all of the support that
[47:47] GameStop has, you know, with that niche,
[47:50] that strong community that of of, you
[47:53] know, die hard game hard uh uh
[47:57] GameStopers, you know, who are huddling
[47:59] to the moon, well, it's wonderful that
[48:02] GameStop has added Bitcoin to their
[48:04] balance sheet. But if GameStop really
[48:07] wants to see Bitcoin do well, if they
[48:10] want their company to make a comeback
[48:12] and thrive, if they want their balance
[48:14] sheet to, you know, to to reflect their
[48:17] their Bitcoin reserve, then they ought
[48:20] to allow their customers to pay in
[48:21] Bitcoin. That's what the GameStop could
[48:24] really do. So we have to have places
[48:26] like that who have, you know, people at
[48:30] the top, you know, who are intertwined
[48:34] with other executives and highlevel
[48:37] CEOs. These people have the
[48:40] information. They understand Bitcoin.
[48:44] That's why they put it on their balance
[48:46] sheet. But yet, they're still choosing
[48:49] to push the substitute money narrative.
[48:54] But we need these people who run these
[48:57] companies to push the medium of exchange
[49:00] of Bitcoin. And if they do not, it's
[49:03] okay because we the people are the final
[49:06] say so. We the people, the
[49:11] nerunners, I'm so glad that Satoshi made
[49:13] the nodunners have the final say so. The
[49:16] nunners are representative of the
[49:19] people. The people have the say so. The
[49:22] people shall lead the way. If we the
[49:25] people decide that we want to use
[49:28] Bitcoin, then any business that wants to
[49:32] survive in a free market economy will
[49:36] transact in
[49:38] Bitcoin. But any business that wants
[49:42] intervention and
[49:45] protection will continue to push the
[49:48] substitute money narrative. But if they
[49:51] want to survive and thrive in a free
[49:54] market economy, you know what? Maybe
[49:55] that's why a lot of businesses aren't
[49:57] using Bitcoin because
[50:00] Bitcoin
[50:02] requires and requires you to
[50:07] compete. It requires you to be
[50:10] accountable. There's accountability in
[50:13] Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a free
[50:16] market. And when you put your business
[50:18] on a Bitcoin standard, you're by means
[50:23] entering a free market society. And
[50:25] there's more
[50:27] competition in a free market society
[50:30] because humans are always going to
[50:33] economize in the best
[50:36] way. They're going to always choose a
[50:38] way to make themselves more
[50:40] profitable. And they can only do that in
[50:42] a free market. But for some of these
[50:45] businesses, they've only
[50:47] survived because they're in a substitute
[50:49] money system that can be controlled,
[50:52] which allows them to stay on
[50:54] top and more importantly locks others
[50:58] out. So, the substitute money system,
[51:00] depending on what kind of person you
[51:02] are, maybe you're taking advantage of
[51:04] the substitute money system and you're
[51:06] taking advantage of people and their
[51:09] energy and their
[51:11] time by keeping them engaged in this
[51:14] substitute money system. Because you
[51:16] know once you decide to give on Bitcoin,
[51:21] once you put your interests in a free
[51:24] market, real money, sound money
[51:28] system, you have to be accountable for
[51:30] your actions. That's where we are. It's
[51:34] scary for people take taking
[51:36] responsibility. It's scary being
[51:39] responsible because I mean, we've all
[51:42] been pacified. We all decided that we
[51:45] wanted to create a
[51:47] government that would lead the
[51:50] way. We decided that it was in our best
[51:53] interest to allow other people to make
[51:55] decisions for us when it comes to our
[51:57] most important economical endeavors. We
[52:01] decided that we wanted others to
[52:03] represent our interests. Even though it
[52:05] is absolutely
[52:07] impossible as Hayek teaches us for these
[52:12] select small group of
[52:15] representatives to understand every
[52:18] human's personal and individual needs at
[52:21] any given moment in time and place in
[52:23] history. It is absolutely impossible. We
[52:27] have given them the task to represent
[52:30] our best economic interests. And it's up
[52:32] to us to decide that we want to be
[52:36] responsible for ourselves. And we want
[52:39] to live in a free market economy and we
[52:43] want to choose the best available
[52:45] salailable commodity to use as a medium
[52:48] of
[52:49] exchange. It is up to us. We the people.
[52:53] We the node runners.
[52:57] You mentioned uh KL Manganger and Hayek
[53:00] a lot. So like Austrian economics. Um so
[53:03] I I guess you studied it quite a bit. I
[53:06] am on that rabbit hole right now and and
[53:09] I'm I'm still studying it is an a lot of
[53:14] information. It's a lot of information
[53:16] to understand to dissect and to really
[53:19] process. Like I said it takes time.
[53:23] But this is the most important subject
[53:25] to humankind. Your your ability to
[53:27] economize. I love the the term
[53:29] economize. It's it's a it's a really
[53:31] nice one. I I don't hear it enough. We
[53:34] don't hear it enough. We don't use it
[53:35] enough, but that's where we are. What
[53:38] What is the so far in in your your
[53:41] rabbit hole of Austrian economics? What
[53:43] what is the most important lessons
[53:44] you've learned so far from that school
[53:46] of thought? that the best way to
[53:49] operate and the best way for humans to
[53:52] thrive is in an open free
[53:55] market and Bitcoin creates that
[53:59] decentralized environment for
[54:01] us and that is it's a basic
[54:05] concept but it's for some reason it's
[54:08] very hard to come to terms
[54:10] with to be free we all say we want to be
[54:13] free but I don't think we all really
[54:15] know what that means Because being free
[54:17] means being responsible for oneself. So
[54:20] maybe some of us don't want to be free.
[54:22] I know some people that don't want to be
[54:24] free. They don't they wouldn't classify
[54:27] it as not wanting to be free, but they
[54:29] don't want to be responsible for
[54:30] themselves. They want somebody else to
[54:31] be responsible for them. So essentially,
[54:33] they don't want to be free. And I
[54:35] understand that it's easier for someone
[54:37] else to make the decision for you. Steve
[54:40] Jobs understood that. This is why Apple
[54:42] thrives the way it does.
[54:45] He said, 'I understand that humans have
[54:46] a hard time making decisions and
[54:49] sometimes there's too many decisions, so
[54:51] let me just make them make them for you.
[54:53] But not when it comes to economizing and
[54:55] choosing the best way to exchange your
[54:58] value, that's a decision you should
[55:00] make. Because if you don't make that
[55:02] decision and somebody else makes it for
[55:04] you, I can almost guarantee you it's not
[55:06] going to be the most productive decision
[55:10] that it could have been if you'd have
[55:11] made it for yourself.
[55:14] Yeah, with the decision that's really
[55:15] true. It's like we all if you just look
[55:20] at sales um for example at cars, uh
[55:24] German cars are still and and they're
[55:26] going a little bit in a different
[55:27] direction now because of Tesla and other
[55:30] players. They offered so many different
[55:32] options. Now Tesla came along and said,
[55:35] "Hey, we offer free versions of every
[55:39] car and you cannot customize anything.
[55:42] You buy it as you get it." Uh, which is
[55:46] amazing because this means the
[55:47] production line is is super easy. But
[55:50] also turns out people only want free
[55:54] options. They they they want no
[55:56] complicated. It's like there's like a
[55:58] long range, right? There's a sports car
[56:01] and then there's the normal version.
[56:03] It's like very simple, easy to
[56:05] understand. Uh, and the traditional car
[56:08] makers, you can uh opt in like what what
[56:11] buttons you want and like what wood and
[56:14] like all those things and
[56:16] like people people are overwhelmed, too
[56:20] many decisions to do, too many decisions
[56:21] to make. And and I think you're right.
[56:24] And more importantly than the too many
[56:26] decisions to make, it's too it's too
[56:29] timeconsuming.
[56:30] We have somehow come to a point in the
[56:33] world where our patience have gone way
[56:39] down. In addition to the value of our
[56:44] time and energy being
[56:45] depleted, our level of patience and
[56:49] willing to take the time to understand
[56:52] and and dig deep and into details of
[56:55] things has gone down.
[56:59] really down. You know, our attention
[57:00] span is just out the window. So, great
[57:05] people like Elon and Steve, they they
[57:07] understand
[57:08] this and they've capitalized on it and
[57:13] it makes it easier. Like you said, they
[57:14] can streamline production. They can give
[57:17] out less choices and people are okay
[57:19] with
[57:20] that. apparently like there are only a
[57:23] select few that want to be fully in
[57:27] charge of making their own decisions and
[57:29] all aspects of what they
[57:31] do. But if you take the time to
[57:34] understand Bitcoin and you and you and
[57:37] you like easy decision
[57:39] making, then you would understand that
[57:41] Bitcoin makes it very easy to
[57:45] transact, especially on a global scale.
[57:49] You don't have to take the time to learn
[57:51] my currency, your currency, what the
[57:54] exchange value is, what it is on this
[57:58] given day, what are the interest rates
[58:02] now? Um, do I invest in bonds this week?
[58:06] Do I buy equities this week? You know,
[58:10] there's a whole lot of different ways
[58:12] and things you have to learn in this
[58:14] substitute system in our process of
[58:17] trying to have less decisions to make.
[58:21] Well, if you really want to make less
[58:23] decisions, if you really want it to be
[58:25] easier, choose Bitcoin. It stores your
[58:28] value as you've already been
[58:30] told, but it is the best way to
[58:33] transact. It makes it easier for you to
[58:37] send me something. It makes it easier
[58:38] for me to send you something. There's no
[58:41] middleman involved unless you choose to
[58:44] have a middleman involved. Unless you
[58:47] choose to have your Bitcoin centralized,
[58:50] that's your option. Free market
[58:54] economy, you know.
[58:56] But if we want easy decisions, come to
[59:00] Bitcoin. If you want to store your value
[59:03] and have a better life and be prosperous
[59:07] and not have to worry about how you're
[59:10] going to survive in the next 10 years,
[59:13] do you have enough for retirement? What
[59:16] if you get sick and you cannot go to
[59:18] work? Do you have enough to live off of
[59:20] for the next 6 months, a year or two, or
[59:22] whatever until you get back on your
[59:24] feet? Well, Bitcoin gives you better
[59:27] options. It takes away the stress of all
[59:30] of those things of having to worry about
[59:33] because you now know you're in a system
[59:35] where your energy is being
[59:38] preserved. You're now in a system where
[59:41] you can easily
[59:43] transact with others on a global scale
[59:47] if you choose to do
[59:49] so. Easy transaction. So if you want
[59:52] simplicity, if you want less decisions,
[59:55] come to Bitcoin. Because if you stay in
[59:58] the substitute money
[59:59] system, even though it's being
[60:01] controlled by
[60:03] others, you still have to make a lot of
[60:05] decisions on how to save yourself in
[60:08] that substitute world. Come to the real
[60:11] world where everything is deflationary,
[60:15] where things go down on time, where your
[60:18] value is preserved, right? Where we're
[60:22] not living in a fake economy, where
[60:25] we're propping up the value of a
[60:28] home. We created a system where the
[60:31] value of a
[60:33] home is where we preserve our wealth.
[60:36] something that should be
[60:38] deflationary. Something that gets easier
[60:41] to make as advancements in technology
[60:44] comes about. Something that we've
[60:45] created more and more and more of. I
[60:49] live in New York City and they're
[60:50] dropping condo buildings, condo
[60:52] buildings everywhere like it's nothing.
[60:56] We have the technology to build fast,
[61:00] quick, but
[61:02] somehow we still have created a system
[61:06] where we're valuing things that are
[61:09] getting easier to
[61:11] make. How did that happen? It happened
[61:13] because it's not real money. So, we had
[61:16] to figure out other ways to create value
[61:18] in a substitute system.
[61:21] We have all of these fake
[61:24] evaluations. You know, we're investing
[61:27] in the stock market that stocks are 40,
[61:31] 50, 60 times
[61:33] overvalued. You know, we're just
[61:36] creating opportunities in substitute
[61:38] money. We're just finding
[61:40] ways to strategize in the substitute
[61:44] world. It's crazy. I mean, if you really
[61:47] really sit and think about
[61:49] it, I mean, we what do we I mean, and
[61:53] and and now enough of us know
[61:56] better to not engage and do that, to not
[62:00] practice those
[62:02] ideas, to teach the younger generation
[62:05] that there is a better
[62:07] way. But for some reason, we still
[62:09] choose to do it. And I understand, you
[62:13] know, bad habits are hard to break.
[62:15] lifetime habits, things that you have
[62:17] been taught since your beginning of
[62:19] creation, they're hard to
[62:21] break. But you have to be
[62:24] willing to uneducate yourself and
[62:28] re-educate yourself in the correct
[62:31] manner. You have to be willing to
[62:34] accept that you have been
[62:36] misled,
[62:38] misinformed, and now it is time to
[62:41] re-evaluate and
[62:43] understand. It is okay. We've it it
[62:47] happened to every single one of us. You
[62:50] are not alone. It did not just happen to
[62:53] you. You didn't just you you weren't
[62:56] just scammed alone. We were all scammed
[62:59] together. And we have been teaching the
[63:01] scam generation after generation. But
[63:04] now we know better. And when you know
[63:07] better, you should do better. That's
[63:10] just the bottom line. We know better.
[63:12] Let's make better
[63:14] decisions. You
[63:15] know, let's go in our own social groups
[63:19] and let's talk about a better way. Let's
[63:23] show a better way forward. We have to do
[63:27] that.
[63:28] We have to get out of
[63:31] this
[63:33] imaginary unrealistic world that we have
[63:36] created for ourselves. And I don't blame
[63:39] anyone because all we're doing at the
[63:42] end of the day is being
[63:44] humans and trying to find the best way
[63:47] forward. So we got stuck in a system
[63:50] that some knew well in advance was a bad
[63:53] idea. This is our third go round in
[63:56] creating a central bank. Our founding
[63:59] fathers understood it was a bad idea.
[64:02] Somewhere in the next few generations
[64:04] that came
[64:06] along, they thought that maybe they
[64:09] could find a way to make it a good idea.
[64:11] But we now have another hundred
[64:14] years of a bad idea in practice and we
[64:18] can see that it's a bad system.
[64:23] What are we going to
[64:24] do as humans? What are we going to do?
[64:29] Are we going to continue in this broken
[64:32] system or are we the people going to
[64:36] take back our
[64:38] value? And I I said like we talked
[64:41] about, I understand Bitcoin is not fully
[64:44] scalable, but at this point, we don't we
[64:47] don't we haven't reached whatever
[64:48] scalability level it is able to achieve.
[64:52] We haven't even come close to that.
[64:53] Let's push it to that point and then we
[64:55] won't have time to focus on the spam
[65:00] narrative because all of our devs will
[65:02] be delving and working hard into scaling
[65:06] Bitcoin because their value has gone up
[65:09] tremendously since more and more people
[65:12] have decided to use Bitcoin as a medium
[65:14] of exchange. So now all the focus is on
[65:18] scalability. We got to get there.
[65:21] But we got to push the correct
[65:23] narrative. We got to push the right
[65:26] narrative. Bitcoin is the best
[65:30] peer-to-peer electronic cash medium of
[65:34] exchange. And because it is the best
[65:36] peer-to-peer electronic cash medium of
[65:40] exchange, you can now store your value
[65:43] there. Let's get to it the right way. We
[65:46] have to do that.
[65:49] I I think there's
[65:51] no there's no better way to to end the
[65:55] podcast. As you know, uh we we still
[65:57] have two questions, the ending
[65:58] questions. But I I love that message so
[66:02] much that I don't even want to um put
[66:06] put anything on on top of that. It it it
[66:08] was it was perfect. And then there's
[66:10] there's so many different aspects we
[66:13] could go down there. Like you you
[66:14] mentioned the house prices. I think uh
[66:17] Bitcoin will solve homelessness uh the
[66:19] crisis because it makes uh housing
[66:22] affordable again. I think Bitcoin is
[66:24] good for mental health. Uh so all of
[66:27] those things also the the idea of the
[66:29] social layer of Bitcoin that we all are
[66:32] Bitcoin. This this is there's so many
[66:34] interesting ideas but but I think we we
[66:37] can talk like another two hours on that.
[66:40] You're you're a fascinating person. Um
[66:42] I'm I'm I'm shocked that you're not on
[66:44] more podcasts. I feel like you you
[66:45] should be on on on every podcast uh that
[66:48] there is. Uh you're an amazing speaker.
[66:51] Uh I'm always careful with with bringing
[66:53] on like new people because there's just
[66:55] no like um it's it's hard to be on a
[66:58] podcast a guest and and and really
[67:00] convey ideas, but you are so freaking
[67:02] good in this. So I'm I'm like why are
[67:04] you not on more podcast? So I hope I see
[67:06] you on every Bitcoin podcast in the
[67:08] future. Well, I do have one lined up
[67:10] next uh that I'm doing next month, but
[67:12] you know, like you said, maybe I'll do
[67:14] some more. Absolutely. Please do. Uh I
[67:17] think um we need I'm all about
[67:21] empowering new voices and and getting uh
[67:23] new voices heard. Uh and I haven't heard
[67:26] you before. I think you have been on
[67:28] like one or two podcasts before. Um uh
[67:32] but uh I I think most people that that
[67:35] listen to this from now probably they
[67:37] have heard you now for the first time.
[67:39] Um and uh I hope there's many more times
[67:44] to come. Uh there's definitely another
[67:46] time coming on my channel but uh there
[67:49] there should be more times also coming
[67:51] on on on other channels. So thank you so
[67:53] much Dion for for being such an amazing
[67:56] guest already. as you know uh I have I
[67:59] ask one question to each and every one
[68:01] of my guests and the question is what
[68:02] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[68:06] Well besides Bitcoin like I said I'm a
[68:08] personal trainer so besides being using
[68:12] Bitcoin to as the best form of way to
[68:16] economize well your best wealth is your
[68:20] health. So, do some form of exercise
[68:25] every day. Dollar cost average and
[68:29] push-ups. Stack Bitcoin, stack push-ups,
[68:32] stack some pull-ups, do some dips, do
[68:35] some squats. Keep moving because your
[68:39] body works just like Bitcoin. If you
[68:42] don't use it, you will lose it, right?
[68:46] So, that's that's another narrative I
[68:48] can push. And if you need some help with
[68:50] that, you can find me online. It sounds
[68:53] like you are into calisthenics.
[68:55] Yes, calisthenics are the best way
[68:57] forward using your body, using what you
[69:01] have, using your natural ability to
[69:03] better yourself without any substitutes.
[69:06] For me, calisthenics is amazing. It's
[69:09] not only in in most city free uh like
[69:13] for example in Vienna there are
[69:14] everywhere calisthenics parks and I I go
[69:17] there and it's usually I'm completely
[69:19] alone and I'm like how how am I alone
[69:22] here? If I go to the gym at that time
[69:25] there's like 50 people and I don't have
[69:27] space. If I go to calisthenics park it's
[69:30] for free it's outdoor. There's sun. Yes.
[69:34] And there's nobody there. Like I I I I
[69:37] cannot know like I I'm I'm always uh
[69:40] blown away why not more people do
[69:42] calisthenics.
[69:44] Well, it's hard. It's
[69:47] accountability. That's what it is.
[69:51] Just it works like Bitcoin. Your health,
[69:53] your wealth, your finance, they all go
[69:56] together. That's it.
[69:59] Awesome. We have an entertaining podcast
[70:01] where the previous guest is asking a
[70:03] question for the next guest without
[70:04] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[70:06] And the previous guest asked you the
[70:08] question. I mean uh I I guess the answer
[70:12] is the the previous one hour that we
[70:14] just recorded, right? But I'll maybe you
[70:17] have a have a different uh different
[70:19] answer to that one. Outside of number go
[70:22] up technology, what are you most excited
[70:24] about the impact of Bitcoin in the
[70:26] world?
[70:27] I'm most excited about the
[70:30] decentralization of Bitcoin. The fact
[70:33] that you, I, and
[70:36] anybody can open up a
[70:40] computer and see all of the Bitcoin
[70:43] transactions, that it is open, that it
[70:45] is decentralized, that we can all run a
[70:47] node, that we can all take part in the
[70:50] process of Bitcoin. I'm excited that
[70:54] Bitcoin is about
[70:56] participation as much as it is, you
[70:59] know, it is about using it to better
[71:02] yourself. You know, you you are a part
[71:06] of the network. You are the
[71:09] network. You know, it requires your
[71:12] engagement. And as and maybe that can be
[71:14] our next conversation is we can talk
[71:16] about the importance of people mining
[71:20] Bitcoin because we have this
[71:22] centralization problem in
[71:25] Bitcoin and we the people as Bob Bernest
[71:29] says we you know the little
[71:33] guys have called the the rabbits in the
[71:35] field. We need more rabbits. We need a
[71:37] lot more rabbits. So everybody be a
[71:40] rabbit cuz the there's power in
[71:43] numbers. We have the power but we got to
[71:47] remember it. We got to remind ourselves.
[71:49] So that's that's my next aspect of
[71:52] Bitcoin. Then uh I I will summarize the
[71:55] three lessons from the day. Use
[71:58] Bitcoin, do calisthenics, and be a
[72:01] rabbit. Be a rabbit. That's correct.
[72:04] Yes.
