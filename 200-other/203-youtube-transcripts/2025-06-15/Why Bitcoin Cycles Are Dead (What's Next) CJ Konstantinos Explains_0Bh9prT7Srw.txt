[00:00] It's undeniable that the cycle is
[00:02] maturing. You know, by this time in
[00:04] previous cycles, price would really
[00:06] start be popping off to extreme premiums
[00:09] to cost of production. So, the where we
[00:11] are in the cycle to me based on price
[00:13] performance is signaling that something
[00:16] in the cycle is changing. The people's
[00:18] reserve Bitcoin bond is designed to
[00:20] unlock that equity. The maturation value
[00:22] plus the interest paid over that 5-year
[00:23] note time will equal your principal
[00:25] investment, which was the 500,000.
[00:27] raising Bitcoin up, officially evolving
[00:29] it from that digital gold to pristine
[00:32] collateral. Not that just you can borrow
[00:34] against your Bitcoin, but that you can
[00:36] borrow against your Bitcoin at the most
[00:38] competitive interest rate in the world.
[00:40] If you're in Bitcoin, you should run a
[00:41] node. The amount of nodes there are
[00:43] relative to Bitcoin users is not good
[00:45] enough. So my position would be if you
[00:47] want to take away OP return data limits,
[00:50] do it when Bitcoin's at the top of the
[00:51] S-curve. Because at the top of the
[00:53] S-curve, you have taken away all bad
[00:55] actor incentive. They hate that the
[00:57] wealth gap between the 1% and the normal
[00:59] person is growing. They hate that so
[01:02] much that it drives them to love Bitcoin
[01:04] because it solves that problem.
[01:08] [Music]
[01:10] Hi SK back on the show. Hello. Hello.
[01:14] Thanks for having me back. It's great to
[01:16] be back man. You've been killing it. I
[01:18] love what you're doing for the community
[01:19] and you deserve all the success that you
[01:21] have and that you continue to grow with.
[01:23] Oh, thank you so much. Yeah, it's it's
[01:25] the third time. I think you're the first
[01:27] guest that has been on a second time and
[01:29] you're also the first guest that has
[01:31] been now on a third time. Uh you only
[01:34] you beat Gary Gdon for like like two
[01:37] weeks. So I will have in two weeks Gary
[01:39] Gdon of the third time on. So yeah, it's
[01:41] it's it's really great to to have you
[01:43] and I always enjoy talking with you. Oh,
[01:45] perfect. You know, it's funny. I I
[01:47] actually met Gary at a Naples Bitcoin
[01:50] conference and we sat at the same table
[01:53] and they had this uh acronym competition
[01:55] and Gary, myself and Trey Sellers from
[01:58] Unchained. We ended up winning the
[02:00] competition and the acronym we came up
[02:01] with was uh for Bitcoin is buy it today
[02:05] cuz opportunity is now. And I think that
[02:08] conference was taking place with Bitcoin
[02:10] like under
[02:11] $30,000. So not only did we come up with
[02:13] a great acronym, but we were right. And
[02:15] Bitcoin is chugging along, baby.
[02:18] Amazing. Uh, on that topic, on that
[02:21] note, what are you currently uh most
[02:23] bullish on? I think it has been like
[02:24] half a year, like maybe eight months,
[02:26] something like that since you last been
[02:28] on. Yeah. Oh, so much has happened. I
[02:31] mean, it's it's funny like you look at
[02:34] human years and dog years, right? And
[02:35] dog years is like you get one year of
[02:37] dog years, seven human years, they say,
[02:39] right? Well, it's like the same thing
[02:41] with like traditional finance and
[02:43] Bitcoin. what we see going on in
[02:44] Bitcoin. It's like seven years of things
[02:47] happen in one year in Bitcoin and Trafi
[02:50] is just they they've had it good for so
[02:52] long that they're oblivious to what's
[02:53] happening. It's amazing that Bitcoin is
[02:55] well over
[02:56] $100,000 after dipping from 100 down to
[02:59] 70 with many many people calling for
[03:02] lower lows and elongated bare market. It
[03:05] just turns out that we just happen to be
[03:06] right back where we were. So all of that
[03:09] happening over that course of the time
[03:10] frame, you know, the thing that I find
[03:12] interesting is that to me it's
[03:15] undeniable that the cycle is maturing.
[03:18] You know, by this time in previous
[03:20] cycles, price would really start be
[03:22] popping off to extreme premiums to cost
[03:25] of production. I mean extreme premiums.
[03:27] And in some cases depending on your in
[03:30] your setup and even if you don't use
[03:32] cost of production but you use Bitcoin
[03:33] fair value price is still at a discount
[03:36] to Bitcoin fair value. So some miners
[03:38] are kind of barely profitable looking in
[03:41] that 80 to 95,000 range depending on
[03:43] your setup and and your opex and capex
[03:46] costs. Uh so so at small premiums and
[03:48] then based on Bitcoin fair value still
[03:51] at extreme discounts. So that where we
[03:53] are in the cycle to me based on price
[03:56] performance is is signaling that
[03:59] something in the cycle is changing. And
[04:02] to me it goes back to what I said before
[04:04] which is yeah we're moving out of the
[04:05] commodity phase and we're moving into
[04:07] the money phase. So we're no longer
[04:09] going to go in this real short commodity
[04:12] cycle but through the monetization and
[04:15] financialization of Bitcoin we're now
[04:17] moving into a credit cycle. And that's
[04:19] what you're seeing right now. A bunch of
[04:22] uh Bitcoin lending companies are now
[04:24] starting to get into the game. We've
[04:26] seen Jack Mullers hop out and talk about
[04:28] Strikes Lending product. We have other
[04:30] lending companies uh getting into the
[04:32] game. We have Bitcoin treasury companies
[04:34] doing reverse mergers uh and
[04:36] accelerating that. So on all fronts, the
[04:38] monetization and financialization of
[04:41] Bitcoin is accelerating. I believe those
[04:43] are the main drivers that are actually
[04:45] leading to the change or or I would say
[04:49] the maturation of the cycle itself where
[04:52] we get these boring periods. You know,
[04:54] Bitcoin went up to 108 109 came back
[04:57] down to the to the mid
[04:59] low70s. Uh and in previous cycles, this
[05:03] correction would not have lasted this
[05:05] long. We would have we would have
[05:06] corrected that big. Players would have
[05:08] been washed out and we would have ripped
[05:10] back up a lot faster. But the the
[05:12] distribution phase in these cycles is
[05:15] showing you that it's no longer OGs and
[05:18] whales and exchanges and and uh free
[05:21] market makers playing in this market.
[05:24] There are big institutional players,
[05:26] institutional accumulators and therefore
[05:29] the supply demand dynamics are changing
[05:31] and the cycle dynamics are changing with
[05:34] that supply demand dynamic. though it's
[05:36] exciting to be a Bitcoiner at this time
[05:37] because I don't think we're going to get
[05:39] those big pullbacks that everybody has
[05:42] anticipated in the past. Sure, we're
[05:44] going to get the pullbacks. That's the
[05:45] regular part of price discovery, but
[05:48] truly we are watching the maturation of
[05:51] the marketplace of the asset class
[05:54] through the monetization and
[05:55] financialization of Bitcoin. And I
[05:57] think, you know, with people's reserve
[05:58] advent later this summer, uh, raising
[06:01] Bitcoin up, officially evolving it from
[06:04] that digital gold to pristine
[06:06] collateral, not that just you can borrow
[06:08] against your Bitcoin, but that you can
[06:09] borrow against your Bitcoin at the most
[06:12] competitive interest rate in the world.
[06:15] Really interesting. I I love that you
[06:17] say like commodity to money cycle, which
[06:20] is super interesting and I don't hear a
[06:22] lot of people talk about that. what are
[06:24] the implications that we're now in in
[06:26] this this money cycle. You already
[06:28] talked about the lower pullbacks but
[06:30] it's this like bigger institutional
[06:32] players. I also saw the same thing where
[06:35] like okay we are seeing a bull run but
[06:38] the excitement is not there uh from a
[06:40] retail crowd. I feel like if you look at
[06:42] Google trends I it's like very low and
[06:45] it's also I don't know if you have
[06:47] experienced the same thing but when I
[06:49] looked outside of the Bitcoin bubble
[06:51] when we first reach I think like 5th of
[06:54] December the 100k mark nobody cared
[06:57] outside of Bitcoin like nobody was like
[06:59] yeah of course 100k like people were
[07:02] like that's the normal thing ever I
[07:03] thought 100k is like a a huge point for
[07:06] the mainstream media. Yeah, absolutely.
[07:09] That nobody I mean in Bitcoin in Bitcoin
[07:12] X, you know, we're all excited. We know
[07:14] what's happening. We're watching it
[07:16] happen with our own eyes and it feels
[07:18] like a fairy tale. You know, you go out
[07:19] to a family event or a church event or
[07:23] with your friends and nobody's talking
[07:25] about Bitcoin. Nobody is talking about
[07:28] what's happening in the financial
[07:29] system. Most people, if they're talking
[07:31] about anything, happens to be, at least
[07:33] here in the United States, happens to be
[07:35] with like Trump tariffs and some people
[07:38] are actually getting into interest
[07:39] rates, which is it's pretty funny to
[07:41] hear normal people talk about interest
[07:43] interest rates and and and bond
[07:46] vigilantes and and lack of treasury
[07:48] debt. So, it's amazing how the
[07:51] conversation in the mainstream has
[07:52] matured itself, but at the same time,
[07:55] it's like they really don't understand
[07:57] what they're talking about, right? It's
[07:58] like every once in a while you get that
[08:00] trending topic and then everybody
[08:02] becomes a professional doctor or a
[08:04] professional lawyer because the topic is
[08:06] trending and everybody's got to put in
[08:07] their opinion and we're not we're not
[08:09] anywhere near that right now. Like you
[08:11] get lucky if you hear a Bitcoin
[08:13] conversation. You get lucky if you hear
[08:15] a economic or interest rate conversation
[08:19] but you are starting to hear them and
[08:21] that rate of luck is starting to
[08:23] increase which I think is a signal that
[08:25] uh things are really going to start
[08:26] heating up here and Fortunately, you
[08:28] know,
[08:30] $100,000, a lot of people think that uh
[08:33] that's a lot of money for a Bitcoin. So,
[08:35] they're waiting, right? A Bitcoin's 103,
[08:37] it's 104. That's so expensive. I'll just
[08:40] wait for it to come back down. But I in
[08:42] my opinion, the way I see this playing
[08:44] out is the next stop for Bitcoin is the
[08:48] price of a single family home. And
[08:50] that's that's when I think regular
[08:51] people are going to wake up. At least
[08:52] here in the United States. I think the
[08:54] median price of a single family home
[08:55] here in the United States is like 400 to
[08:58] 450,000. So I I anticipate that when
[09:00] Bitcoin gets to 400 to
[09:02] 450,000, a lot more people are going to
[09:04] be paying attention because once we go
[09:06] beyond that
[09:07] level, it's going to be it's going to be
[09:09] almost impossible for the everyday
[09:11] person to accumulate a whole Bitcoin. I
[09:14] mean, Janet Yellen, who was not my
[09:16] favorite Secretary of the Treasury, she
[09:18] did have at least one good quote, and
[09:20] that quote was that Americans most
[09:22] important source of wealth is in their
[09:24] home equity. So, in order for a person
[09:27] to buy a home, most people are using a
[09:29] mortgage, and then that home becomes
[09:31] almost like their savings account. And
[09:34] it takes a lifetime. It takes 30 year
[09:37] mortgages, 30-year pledge of working and
[09:39] paying to accumulate your home. Well,
[09:42] Bitcoin is about to cost more than a
[09:44] home. And I think that realization of
[09:46] wow, I thought I thought the most
[09:48] expensive thing I would have to pay for
[09:50] in my life is my home. But instead, it's
[09:53] actually going to be access to savings
[09:55] technology because we live in a world
[09:57] where the ability to save has been
[09:59] stripped away by the system itself. And
[10:01] in order for the system to maintain a a
[10:04] semblance, I don't want to say
[10:06] stability. Let's let's say in order for
[10:07] the system to maintain status quo,
[10:09] they're going to need need to keep
[10:11] printing money. Therefore, there is no
[10:13] savings vehicle in the world that let
[10:16] you outpace inflation, the true rate of
[10:18] inflation, which is the expansion of
[10:20] currency units. So, Bitcoin being this
[10:22] savings technology, I think that's in
[10:24] our minds, like in in Bitcoiners minds,
[10:27] yeah, we're going from digital gold to
[10:28] pristine collateral. But if I go up to
[10:30] normal person and say the words pristine
[10:32] collateral, they'll look back at me like
[10:33] I'm speaking another language. They have
[10:35] no idea what that means. But when they
[10:37] realize that, hey, it's harder to
[10:39] accumulate one bitcoin than it is a
[10:41] single family home, that's going to set
[10:44] off some of the light bulbs uh and help
[10:46] people understand what's really
[10:48] happening here. So, it's really
[10:49] interesting that it took 16 years to go
[10:52] from 0 to
[10:54] $100,000. What about the next
[10:56] $100,000? I think we can get the next
[10:58] $100,000 in less than 16 months. So 16
[11:02] years to get the first 100,000. Most
[11:06] likely less than 16 months to get the
[11:08] second 100,000. And then from that point
[11:11] forward, uh the only the only way is up.
[11:15] Especially with the way the US
[11:16] administration is talking about Bitcoin,
[11:19] global adoption of Bitcoin is going up.
[11:21] The supply is just not there. And at
[11:24] some point in time, we will have a
[11:26] repricing of the entire asset class. And
[11:28] that's the move you don't want to miss
[11:30] because it's going to be much higher
[11:31] than a single family home. I think I
[11:33] think we go to the seven-digit level and
[11:35] that will be your next psychological
[11:36] level, that million-doll level where we
[11:39] have to have another thing since they we
[11:40] hit 100, right? We first hit 100 and we
[11:42] we mellow out. We go through
[11:44] distribution, we bounce up and down. I
[11:46] think single family home million
[11:48] distribution mellow out. Uh and that
[11:51] mellowing out could take a while. Uh or
[11:53] or it could accelerate through. I don't
[11:55] know. These Bitcoin treasury companies,
[11:56] I think, are the are the variable that
[11:58] we need to keep our eyes on because
[12:00] remember, it's not just retail anymore.
[12:02] It's not just the mom and pops who are
[12:03] going to wake up. It's going to be the
[12:05] rest of the world. It's going to be all
[12:07] the small and medium-sized businesses.
[12:09] Every single publicly traded company
[12:10] that you know or has a ticker is going
[12:14] to play a role in accumulating Bitcoin
[12:16] because if they don't, they're going to
[12:18] get left behind. I love the importance
[12:20] of this like one bitcoin and I know it's
[12:22] an arbitrary number like you could pick
[12:24] any number but like round numbers are
[12:27] really important for human psychology
[12:29] and I think a lot of people still have
[12:31] the goal of like getting to one bitcoin
[12:33] and let's be honest like 100k is for the
[12:37] average person almost unreachable
[12:40] already. I mean, maybe for the average
[12:42] person in the US it's possible, but like
[12:44] average person worldwide, it's it's very
[12:47] hard for them already to get like the
[12:48] one Bitcoin. And it it's super
[12:51] interesting that you cap that with like
[12:53] a a single family home because I think
[12:55] that's like a really good comparison. A
[12:58] lot of I don't know how it is in
[13:00] America, but probably the this the same
[13:02] thing as you already said in Austria, in
[13:04] Europe, it's like the home is kind of
[13:07] your savings account and your pension
[13:09] plan. And uh this this couldn't I I I I
[13:13] really think we should now shift to
[13:15] Bitcoin. That might have been a good
[13:16] strategy like 50 years ago. Uh but now
[13:19] Bitcoin is is is kind of the better
[13:21] strategy. And getting one Bitcoin above
[13:24] the value of a single family home will
[13:26] also put it close and closer to gold.
[13:30] Closer and closer to be the single most
[13:32] valuable asset. I think that's also
[13:34] another flipping point. When Bitcoin
[13:36] flips gold, that that will be massive
[13:38] also. Yeah, I mean you're I mean that's
[13:40] a 10x from here. So if we want to flip
[13:43] gold, we got to get over 20 trillion
[13:45] market cap. And I think gold's well
[13:48] above 20 trillion right now where it's
[13:49] trading, which is a clear signal to the
[13:51] marketplace. You know, um Fed chairs
[13:54] have always, if you go back and you read
[13:56] some of their work or listen to what
[13:57] they've said, the best ones always
[13:59] looked at gold to measure monetary
[14:01] policy and and if you can make the
[14:03] dollar stable against gold, you have you
[14:05] have proper monetary policy. But if the
[14:07] price of gold is going up against the
[14:09] dollar, then the policy is too loose.
[14:13] You need to tighten and you need to
[14:14] strengthen the dollar and and bring the
[14:16] gold price back down. But as you well
[14:18] know, we cannot do that here in the
[14:20] United States. We cannot raise interest
[14:22] rates. Number one, because the entire
[14:24] real estate market here in the United
[14:27] States is frozen. Most people during the
[14:30] zero interest rate policy years were
[14:32] able to attain a very low interest rate.
[14:35] I mean, some of them as low as 2%, but
[14:37] most in the 2 to 4% area. Today, if you
[14:40] want to get a mortgage in the United
[14:42] States and you have a pretty decent
[14:44] credit score, you're going to be in like
[14:45] the 6 to 7 or 8% range, depending on
[14:48] your credit score and relationship with
[14:50] the bank. So, that the the the most
[14:52] qualified buyers are getting in that 6%
[14:55] range. And that is 50% more than the 4%
[14:59] of the higherend range of before. So
[15:01] those those higher qualified borrowers,
[15:03] they're in the 2 to 3% range and maybe
[15:06] they've been doing well and they want to
[15:07] upgrade from, you know, they they they
[15:09] started out in a 2,000 square foot
[15:11] single family home, they upgraded to a
[15:13] 4,000 foot home and now their family's
[15:16] grown a little bit and they're looking
[15:17] to get into a bigger home with some more
[15:19] space, maybe um a space with an extra
[15:22] property for some people that work on
[15:24] the property to take care of it and and
[15:26] help the family out and they're looking
[15:28] to make that move, but they can't. And
[15:29] then so the people who are just trying
[15:31] to get in the game forget about it. They
[15:32] they can't even get access to to credit
[15:35] to buy the real estate. So that's why
[15:37] the that's the real reason the market is
[15:38] frozen. So it's kind of like this magic
[15:40] point in time where we have a frozen
[15:42] real estate market and Bitcoin has the
[15:44] potential to soar past the price of that
[15:47] home. Because for any saver, anybody who
[15:50] is saving to buy a home, regardless of
[15:52] what country you're in, there's one
[15:54] thing that you understand. It's going to
[15:56] take more than a couple years to save up
[15:57] to actually buy the home. And then over
[16:00] those course of years, the the the value
[16:02] of the home, the size of the home
[16:05] continues to go down, right? So the
[16:06] price of the home continues to go up.
[16:08] Therefore, the square footage that you
[16:10] can attain with your purchasing power
[16:12] goes down because the prices of the home
[16:14] are going faster going up faster than
[16:16] wages. And there's no way to to to
[16:19] outpace that. And that's the real magic
[16:21] I think that Bitcoin has here through
[16:24] people's reserve. There's there's coming
[16:26] a new narrative that we haven't seen
[16:28] before which bridges Bitcoin powered
[16:31] finance to the real world assets. And
[16:35] you know there's a big narrative in in
[16:36] crypto about real world assets but there
[16:39] hasn't really been that killer app yet
[16:41] because there's been no way to really
[16:43] connect the two. Tokenization of assets
[16:45] and all this other stuff doesn't really
[16:47] empower the individual. It might empower
[16:49] the corporation or a group of investors,
[16:51] but it doesn't. It's not financial
[16:53] engineering for retail, right? It's
[16:55] financial engineering for corporations
[16:56] and institutions. And at People's
[16:58] Reserve, we focus on financial
[17:00] engineering for retail. We want to make
[17:02] sure that you are empowered by Bitcoin.
[17:04] So now what we want to see come become
[17:07] synonymous is that when you want to buy
[17:08] a home the first thing that comes to
[17:11] your mind is well I better start saving
[17:12] in Bitcoin because Bitcoin is what's
[17:14] going to get me access to credit and
[17:17] Bitcoin is what's going to give me the
[17:18] ability to save in a timely manner to
[17:22] purchase my home and to afford my home
[17:24] because these homes are unaffordable.
[17:26] The market is frozen because of the
[17:28] interest rates. And even if the Fed
[17:30] lowers interest rates, prices are still
[17:32] so high right now that if they start
[17:34] lowering interest rates, demand will go
[17:36] up. That will push prices up. And and
[17:38] the new base, you're very quickly the
[17:41] the medium price of a family home will
[17:42] go from 400 to 450 up to 500 to 550. And
[17:47] that's, you know, that's 100 to 150k
[17:49] value increase. Most people are not
[17:50] making 100 to 150k a year in their
[17:53] salary. The average salary here in the
[17:55] United States, I think, is around $55
[17:57] $60,000. And then when you take into
[17:59] account expenses, you're lucky to save
[18:01] up $5,000 or $10,000 making that kind of
[18:05] money, especially if you have a family.
[18:06] If you have a family, you probably have
[18:07] credit debt. And credit debt is going to
[18:09] new all-time highs. So the purchasing
[18:11] power of the American consumer and
[18:13] consumers worldwide is as we know being
[18:16] drained from them through the design of
[18:18] the fiat system through the ability of
[18:20] the governments to steal their
[18:22] purchasing power and spend it through
[18:24] printing. And Bitcoin finally comes in
[18:26] and says, you know what, we're not going
[18:28] to let this happen anymore. We when you
[18:30] adopt Bitcoin as a savings technology
[18:33] and you use it, it's it's what Bitcoin
[18:36] does. Warren Buffett has a great quote.
[18:38] If you if you have to work to make money
[18:40] your whole life, you'll work until
[18:41] you'll die. You have to find a way to
[18:42] make your money work for you. Fantastic.
[18:45] I don't have to take my money and invest
[18:46] it to make it work for me. Bitcoin was
[18:49] engineered to work for me. It was
[18:51] strategically designed to leverage the
[18:53] those natural laws of economics to work
[18:56] for me in its design. It doesn't need to
[18:58] be deployed to work. It works through
[19:01] its design and it's working better than
[19:03] anything else we ever seen. I think the
[19:05] 10-year Kagger right now is
[19:07] 82%. I mean, even at People's Reserve, I
[19:10] have like model we run models and we and
[19:12] we we try to figure out how to teach
[19:14] people and how especially politicians
[19:17] with municipal Bitcoin bonds how this
[19:19] can work. And we've been using like the
[19:20] 50 60% KAGER and then we usually cut
[19:23] that in half to get to the 25 30% Kagger
[19:26] that Michael sees in the long term. But
[19:28] the 10-year Bitcoin Kagger right now is
[19:29] 82%. So when you run the numbers on
[19:32] that, that's insane. That's that kind of
[19:35] growth is impossible in any other asset
[19:38] class in the world. So for those of you
[19:41] who are watching this show and you have
[19:42] that dream of owning your own home,
[19:45] you're not going to do it by saving in
[19:47] in fiat currency units. It's fiat
[19:50] currency units lose value over time by
[19:52] design. Bitcoin gains value over time by
[19:57] design. That needs to be your savings
[19:59] vehicle. And when you make it your
[20:00] savings vehicle, you'll be able to
[20:02] accomplish your goals much faster. And
[20:04] when you have services like People's
[20:06] Reserve, when you finally get to that
[20:08] point, you actually won't need to sell
[20:09] the Bitcoin. You will just borrow
[20:11] against it. And now you're borrowing
[20:12] these inflating fiat currency units that
[20:15] lose purchasing power over time against
[20:17] your pristine collateral that gains
[20:20] value over time. And what happens is the
[20:22] burden of the debt shrinks. It shrinks
[20:25] over time to the extent at some point in
[20:27] time you can eliminate that debt with
[20:29] the value increase in your Bitcoin. Now
[20:31] you own your home and your Bitcoin. You
[20:34] didn't have to give up your Bitcoin to
[20:35] buy the home. And these types of
[20:37] financial products are what's driving
[20:40] the monetization and financialization of
[20:42] Bitcoin because the big players in the
[20:43] in the industry, they absolutely know
[20:46] what's coming, which is why we're in
[20:47] Spax season right now. and they're
[20:49] getting prepared because when these
[20:50] products go live, not only from us, but
[20:52] from all types of uh companies that are
[20:55] going to be offering these products and
[20:57] services, not exactly like ours, but
[20:59] similar. And and be careful. Choose your
[21:01] counterparty wisely, right? Make sure
[21:03] you understand liquidation risk. Make
[21:05] sure you understand what your options
[21:06] are in that contract. Make sure you
[21:08] understand your counterparty. Choose
[21:10] your counterparty wisely. And if you
[21:12] want to be with Bitcoin maxis who built
[21:14] for Bitcoin maxis, you'll want to be at
[21:16] People's Reserve. Now, if you don't care
[21:17] about that, then you then you can go
[21:18] with somebody else. If you want to make
[21:20] sure that your Bitcoin can't be
[21:21] liquidated based on Bitcoin's price
[21:24] volatility, well, then you'll want to be
[21:25] with People's Reserve. If you don't care
[21:27] about price volatility and you have a
[21:28] big stack and you're only borrowing a
[21:30] very small amount against it, well then
[21:31] go to wherever you can get the best
[21:32] interest rate. But most likely, if you
[21:34] want the best interest rate, you're also
[21:36] going to become the people's reserve.
[21:37] But if you pay attention to those three
[21:38] points, I think it's going to be really
[21:40] clear that the future of finance of all
[21:44] finance, not just Bitcoin powered
[21:46] finance, all finance will incorporate
[21:48] Bitcoin into it. And if it doesn't, it
[21:50] will just be eliminated because the
[21:51] incentive will break. I love that. And I
[21:55] completely missed a question, but like
[21:57] uh you already explained it a little
[21:59] bit. At Bit Reserve, you are doing
[22:01] basically borrowing against your Bitcoin
[22:04] for retail people. Yes. Yes. So the so
[22:07] the biggest difference for us at
[22:08] People's Reserve because I've been in
[22:10] the industry for a while and I've had
[22:11] sleepless nights. I mean I I've had
[22:13] loans out against Bitcoin and the price
[22:15] of Bitcoin is going down down down big
[22:18] down and you're like where's the bounce?
[22:20] Where's the where? You don't know.
[22:22] You're going to go to bed and you don't
[22:23] know if you're going to wake up and that
[22:25] Bitcoin is going to be there or not.
[22:26] Your Bitcoin could be liquidated and
[22:28] then if you add more Bitcoin to margin
[22:31] and something weird happens, you could
[22:33] lose that Bitcoin too. So now it becomes
[22:35] like, well, do I just lose what I
[22:36] originally posted or do I put more
[22:39] Bitcoin and take the risk of losing even
[22:40] more Bitcoin than I originally posted? I
[22:42] mean, and you literally will lose sleep
[22:44] at night. I know I did. So when we
[22:46] created our products, we we knew we have
[22:49] to eliminate this liquidation risk. And
[22:51] I I think the real innovation in our
[22:53] products, which nobody else in the
[22:55] industry is doing, is that we just
[22:57] adjust your interest rate. So when the
[22:59] price of Bitcoin goes down, uh, your
[23:02] interest rate could go up, but within
[23:04] limits, right? So some people have
[23:05] reached out to us and been like, "Hey,
[23:06] are you going to be charging 20%
[23:08] interest rates like a credit card?" And
[23:10] I'm like, first of all, that's that's
[23:11] there there's usury laws against that.
[23:13] So we can't do that anyway because of
[23:14] regulations. And second of all, that's
[23:16] value extraction. So you know, we we
[23:19] anchor our rate to what what today is
[23:22] the prime rate. So the prime rate today
[23:24] is 7 and a half. and and depending on
[23:26] how much Bitcoin collateral you post,
[23:28] you could actually get prime minus
[23:29] interest rates. So, if the value of
[23:31] Bitcoin goes down, you'll start moving
[23:33] above prime, but you're not going to be
[23:35] moving to double prime, which is which
[23:37] is where some of the Bitcoin lenders are
[23:39] today in the in the 12 to 16% range to
[23:43] borrow against your Bitcoin with
[23:44] liquidation risk uh for an
[23:46] overcolateralized loan. It just doesn't
[23:48] make sense. You as Bitcoiners hold the
[23:50] most pristine form of collateral in the
[23:52] world. And there are not many lenders
[23:54] out there that look at Bitcoin as
[23:57] pristine collateral. And most
[23:59] importantly, I think this is important
[24:01] too. We have a relationship maxi mindset
[24:04] at People's Reserve. We believe that if
[24:06] we build relationships with people in
[24:08] the long term will have a stronger, more
[24:11] sustainable business, than a business
[24:13] that is just coming in and taking
[24:15] advantage of temporary arbitrage
[24:17] opportunities and interest rates, right?
[24:19] Because a big player will come in,
[24:21] they'll have a credit line or a
[24:22] warehouse, they'll be borrowing at 6 or
[24:24] 7% and then they'll turn around, they'll
[24:26] flip that credit line to the borrower,
[24:28] and then that's where the 12 and 14 and
[24:30] 15% come because they want to make
[24:32] money, too. So they have to arbitrage
[24:33] the difference between their borrow rate
[24:35] and the borrow rate at which they're
[24:37] lending to the borrower. So in order to
[24:39] make money, they have to charge those
[24:41] higher rates. But at People's Reserve,
[24:42] we've done our best to source LPs who
[24:45] understand that lending to the
[24:47] government is not risk-free and that the
[24:51] risk-free borrower is actually the
[24:54] Bitcoiner. It's the overcolateralized
[24:56] Bitcoiner who presents the risk-free
[24:58] opportunity. And then additionally, and
[25:01] this is to me this is just another thing
[25:02] that institutions and liquidity
[25:05] providers are waking up to this. When
[25:07] you lend your money to the government,
[25:09] the principle of that stays in the cash
[25:11] equivalent, right? It stays in the debt
[25:12] note and then that debt note is deflated
[25:15] over time. So there's an ongoing soft
[25:19] default for those people who hold
[25:21] treasury debt because they have to print
[25:23] the money to make good on the debt which
[25:25] means there's going to be dilution which
[25:26] means the real rate of interest is
[25:28] negative which means the cash equivalent
[25:30] principle is being diluted over time.
[25:33] What we've been able to do at People's
[25:34] Reserve is source LPs who understand
[25:37] that just because the government has a
[25:39] printer, that doesn't make them the
[25:41] risk-free lender. Because if everything
[25:43] folds, like we've gone through soft
[25:44] default now. What if we go through a
[25:46] hard default? No one ever really talks
[25:48] about this. I've only ever heard Peter
[25:50] Schiff, funny enough, talk about this,
[25:51] but Donald Trump was a great
[25:54] businessman. He declared bankruptcy a
[25:55] few times and restructured the assets uh
[25:58] in his portfolio a few times in order to
[26:01] make it out of that bankruptcy. and end
[26:03] up where he is now. So, it's it's it's
[26:06] it's a higher percentage chance that he
[26:08] does some type of restructuring with
[26:10] Bent and Lutnik on existing debt uh than
[26:13] it is with any other president who
[26:15] really was never a businessman and just
[26:17] probably let other people deal with it.
[26:19] So, he you know he might play that card.
[26:21] Now, I don't think he will uh because
[26:23] the soft default strategy is working
[26:25] good. You don't there's no need to hard
[26:27] default. The United States has a lot of
[26:28] natural, you know, the asset side of our
[26:30] balance sheet, even though our debt side
[26:33] is 36 trillion plus another 220
[26:35] something trillion of liabilities. In
[26:37] the long term, I think most people still
[26:39] believe the United States can cover that
[26:41] debt. I think that the the asset to debt
[26:43] ratio, liquid assets are are not enough
[26:47] to cover, but the intangible assets, the
[26:50] the growth of the economy, the level of
[26:52] innovation, uh, and thus potential for
[26:55] increased tax revenues, like it's
[26:57] greater here than it is anywhere else in
[27:00] the world. It can grow more here than it
[27:02] could anywhere else in the world. And
[27:04] that gives them a little bit of trust.
[27:05] The that last little string of trust.
[27:07] You know, in my previous shows, we
[27:09] talked about the only difference between
[27:10] inflation and hyperinflation is trust.
[27:12] Well, there's this little string of
[27:13] trust left, and it's based in the hope
[27:16] of patriots who believe in America and
[27:18] believe in the will of America and and
[27:21] freedom and liberty to pursue free
[27:23] markets and to create value and deliver
[27:25] it to the economy. That is kind of like
[27:26] the last string that is saving the
[27:30] financial position of the United States.
[27:31] So if we can strengthen that position
[27:33] and string by including Bitcoin
[27:35] innovation like the strategic Bitcoin
[27:37] reserve in the future a bitcoin
[27:39] recapitalization fund where we can do
[27:41] more more things with the Bitcoin with
[27:43] less handcuffs. Um those are the types
[27:45] of things that are going to I think
[27:48] change everything because uh I think
[27:51] Nixon said at one time or somebody said
[27:53] at one time as the US goes so goes the
[27:55] world. So, if we can if we can embrace
[27:57] Bitcoin and we can adopt Bitcoin, we're
[28:00] going to see it across the spectrum and
[28:02] that is going to really accelerate
[28:04] things where we go up the S-curve. And I
[28:07] think that's what everybody's waiting
[28:08] for. We are waiting to move up the
[28:10] S-curve. We're very clearly at the
[28:12] bottom of the S-curve, but through
[28:13] monetization and financialization, we
[28:15] are about to explode up the S-curve. And
[28:18] that's the move you don't want to miss.
[28:20] Now, if you do miss that move, you don't
[28:23] lose anything from Bitcoin, right? If
[28:24] you get in, if you're the last person to
[28:26] get into Bitcoin, you're still going to
[28:28] benefit from Bitcoin because Bitcoin is
[28:30] a truth money. It's an honest money that
[28:32] can't be diluted. And at the top of the
[28:35] Scurve, we'll finally get that
[28:37] stability. At the top of the Scurve,
[28:40] Bitcoin will be a derivative of the
[28:42] global economy, not just of one
[28:45] country's stock market. So, when we get
[28:47] there, um things will be a lot easier to
[28:51] understand how the economy will function
[28:52] and work. But the opportunity to get
[28:55] extremely wealthy in Bitcoin in my
[28:57] opinion is is is coming up and it comes
[29:01] with that repricing in this S-curve
[29:03] adoption. Once we make this move,
[29:05] Bitcoin will be repriced and it will
[29:07] become more volatile than it ever has
[29:09] before, not less volatile. The the lower
[29:12] volatility comes up at the top of the
[29:14] S-curve. But while you're in the middle
[29:16] of making that move from the bottom to
[29:17] the top, volatility is going to
[29:19] increase. And so people need to be
[29:21] prepared in their mind to just say, you
[29:23] know, if if your wealth goes up and down
[29:26] by the the value of your salary per day,
[29:29] like just be prepared for that. Get your
[29:31] get in the mindset. Understand this is
[29:32] going to be volatile. Look at how look
[29:34] at that the price of gold through the
[29:36] Weimar inflation. When the when the mark
[29:39] inflated, the price of gold got more
[29:41] volatile, not less volatile. So I'm not
[29:43] saying that the dollar is going to
[29:44] hyperinflate, especially if we get a
[29:46] strategic Bitcoin reserve. I think it
[29:48] could actually strengthen the dollar.
[29:50] Because it's if we put the Bitcoin on
[29:51] the asset side of our balance sheet, the
[29:54] asset side of our balance sheet will be
[29:55] able to outgrow the pace of growth of
[29:58] the asset side of our balance sheet will
[30:00] be greater than the pace of growth in
[30:02] the liability side even with all the
[30:03] printing that we're doing. That's the
[30:05] type of value uh acrual that you can get
[30:08] by putting Bitcoin on your balance
[30:09] sheet. So, corporations are figuring
[30:11] out, institutions are figuring it out,
[30:13] small and medium-sized businesses are
[30:14] figuring out, governments are figuring
[30:16] it out, individuals are figuring it out.
[30:19] And if the majority of them figure it
[30:21] out before you, you're going to lose
[30:23] your opportunity to generate
[30:25] generational wealth through the S-curve
[30:27] adoption move. And I don't want to see
[30:28] anybody listening to this show or any of
[30:30] your family and friends miss out on that
[30:32] because it only comes one time. You
[30:35] don't get you don't get this uh this is
[30:37] kind of like a once in a civilization
[30:39] thing. week, we finally discovered
[30:40] money. Like up until Bitcoin, we used
[30:43] seashells, we used gold, we used paper
[30:47] notes, we used derivative promises, we
[30:49] used all these different types of things
[30:50] to try to facilitate transactions
[30:53] between each other. Uh, and we never
[30:55] found anything that worked. But now with
[30:57] Bitcoin, we actually have the solution.
[30:59] We found money. We've invented money.
[31:02] And this truth money is only going to
[31:04] come around one time. And now's the time
[31:06] to embrace it and be empowered through
[31:09] its adoption on a global scale. And if
[31:11] you do that, I think, and this is what
[31:13] makes me most excited, people like you
[31:15] and me and the other Bitcoiners that we
[31:17] know, some of the best people in the
[31:19] world are Bitcoiners. They're the
[31:20] opposite of the central bankers, right?
[31:22] The central bankers are the ones who who
[31:24] create the problem. The love of money is
[31:26] the root of all evil. A lot of
[31:28] Bitcoiners don't love money, but they
[31:30] just love being prudent. They love
[31:31] understanding that they have a savings
[31:33] technology and that it's empowering them
[31:35] and they're not being stolen from
[31:37] through the current system. They've
[31:38] detached from the matrix, but then that
[31:40] that that leads to them respecting life
[31:42] and respecting others. And I think we we
[31:44] move to a bright orange future where
[31:46] Bitcoiners have the most purchasing
[31:47] power because the things that go on in
[31:49] the world when Bitcoiners are funding
[31:50] them are going to be much better things
[31:53] than what's going on in the world right
[31:54] now. I love that so much. Uh that's
[31:57] that's really really a great explanation
[31:59] of that. And I I I want to I want to
[32:02] touch on one thing. Um you with the
[32:06] people reserves, but uh I think strategy
[32:09] probably started that whole thing with
[32:11] like playing the fiat game to get more
[32:14] Bitcoin and making the black hole up.
[32:18] I I think that this actually accelerates
[32:22] the move towards a Bitcoin standard and
[32:25] actually probably makes it move and the
[32:27] adoption of Bitcoin even faster because
[32:30] when all the Bitcoiners are opening up
[32:33] uh that feared games that can suck in
[32:36] more financial energy to get more
[32:39] Bitcoin and suck more and more in there
[32:41] and there's like bonds and there is all
[32:44] different kinds of uh fiat deriv
[32:46] derivatives from that that kind of opens
[32:49] up a black hole of Bitcoin that can make
[32:53] that scurve adoption moment that
[32:56] suddenly moment even
[32:59] more abrupt even more even faster than
[33:02] than we than we would have otherwise had
[33:05] because uh if number go up people come
[33:09] in in the in in Bitcoin and they realize
[33:12] oh I have I have to listen to to those
[33:14] Bitcoin guys all of the sudden and Then
[33:17] they also start doing that. I think we
[33:19] are kind of opening up a black hole for
[33:21] for for Bitcoin adoption. Oh yeah. I
[33:24] mean, I'm a big fan of Michael Sailor.
[33:27] My split adjusted price is $27. I've
[33:30] been with him on this ride for quite
[33:31] some time. There's no doubt in my mind
[33:34] he opened the Pandora's box of financial
[33:37] engineering. And even what we do here at
[33:39] People's Reserve is building on top of
[33:42] his shoulders. So he is the original
[33:45] innovator. He is the original person to
[33:47] to bring this forward. He's at the tip
[33:50] of the spear for financial institutions
[33:53] and corporations. And at People's
[33:55] Reserve, you know, we're building on top
[33:57] of his shoulders and learning from his
[34:00] innovation and continuing that
[34:02] innovation and bringing financial
[34:04] engineering to retail. And that's what's
[34:07] so exciting about People's Reserve. I
[34:08] mean, in the long run, and I think this
[34:10] is probably a great time to share this,
[34:12] but for those of you who don't know,
[34:14] it's spa season here in the United
[34:16] States of America. So, Spa is a special
[34:18] purpose acquisition company. This is a
[34:21] company that is publicly traded who sole
[34:24] purpose is to acquire or be acquired.
[34:27] And we recently saw David Bailey with
[34:29] Nakamoto do a reverse merger into a spa
[34:32] and now have a publicly traded Bitcoin
[34:34] treasury company. People's Reserve is
[34:36] pursuing this same goal. People's
[34:38] Reserve is looking to perform a reverse
[34:41] merger so that it can get access to US
[34:43] capital markets and we have some really
[34:46] cool ideas that build on top of uh
[34:49] Michael Sailor's flywheel to where we
[34:52] can access these capital markets not
[34:55] only to acquire Bitcoin and put Bitcoin
[34:57] on the balance sheet but just as
[34:59] important to empower Bitcoiners because
[35:03] I think that's that's probably where
[35:04] there's one one little gap of
[35:06] understanding is that when you're in
[35:07] micro strategy. And remember, I'm a
[35:09] long-term shareholder, split adjusted
[35:10] price of $27. It's it's a Bitcoin
[35:12] accumulation game right now. And the
[35:15] long-term theory in my mind is
[35:17] eventually Micro Strategy will be
[35:20] somewhat of a central bank of the
[35:22] internet economy, right? And the
[35:24] internet economy, for those of you who
[35:25] haven't listened to our previous
[35:26] episodes, the internet economy is an
[35:28] amazing domain. It is the only economy
[35:30] in the world with no debt. It is the
[35:32] only economy in the world that no one
[35:34] country can control or out compete. And
[35:37] I think most importantly, it's the only
[35:38] economy in the world with free market
[35:40] interest rates. So, um, you definitely
[35:43] want to be in a position where you are
[35:45] one of those, for lack of a better term,
[35:48] central banks of the internet economy.
[35:50] And these Bitcoin treasury companies,
[35:52] they are the future central banks of the
[35:55] internet economy. and people's reserve
[35:56] wants to play a role in that marketplace
[35:59] because we believe uh if people are
[36:01] familiar with the yield curve the very
[36:03] very front end of the yield curve is the
[36:05] federal funds rate and the federal funds
[36:08] rate is an overnight interbank lending
[36:10] rate. Well, in the in the internet
[36:14] economy, there is no technical bank. But
[36:16] in my opinion, these Bitcoin treasury
[36:18] companies. They will be the future
[36:20] banks. And those inter Bitcoin treasury
[36:23] company lending rates will actually be
[36:26] the overnight rate. So the rate between
[36:28] a people's reserve and strategy or a
[36:31] strategy and a Meta Planet and a Metanet
[36:33] and a 21. These inner bank lending rates
[36:37] are actually going to formulate and
[36:40] create what would be equivalent to the
[36:44] trades federal funds rate and we'll have
[36:47] an overnight rate between BTC's. It's
[36:49] it's funny that it's BT Bitcoin Treasury
[36:51] Company BTC's BTC to BTC's inner bank
[36:55] rate that will create the very front end
[36:58] of the yield curve. And what I'm so
[37:00] excited about is that I believe people's
[37:02] reserve products are going to form the
[37:05] other parts of the yield curve because
[37:06] right now there's nowhere to look
[37:08] besides these inner bank lending rates
[37:10] that don't ex don't exist yet. We have
[37:12] funding rates. So but funding rates are
[37:14] based on leverage and derivative
[37:16] products and also the balance of bulls
[37:19] and bears within the marketplace. So
[37:20] funding rates are kind of their own
[37:22] little thing and they're every eight
[37:24] hours. So, I I I I think it's hard to
[37:26] plug that into the yield curve, but when
[37:28] you start getting five-year bonds and
[37:31] seven-year mortgages and 15-year
[37:33] mortgages and 30-year mortgages, people
[37:35] are going to wake up in the morning,
[37:36] they're going to check the price of
[37:37] Bitcoin. They're going to check the
[37:38] price of gold. They're going to look at
[37:40] the US 10-year Treasury interest rate,
[37:42] and then they're going to move on to the
[37:44] free market internet economy, and
[37:46] they're going to check the inner bank,
[37:47] Bitcoin Treasury Company to Bitcoin
[37:49] Treasury Company rate. They're going to
[37:51] check the five, seven, 15, and 30-year
[37:54] Bitcoin powered mortgage rate because
[37:56] now we are what this the the financial
[37:58] revolution is not just about free market
[38:00] money. It's about free market interest
[38:02] rates, which means free market yield
[38:04] curve. And the internet economy will be
[38:07] the only domain in the world for an
[38:09] unanchored free market yield curve. So
[38:12] sure in the traditional market you have
[38:13] bond vigilantes. You can sell it off but
[38:15] there's anchor rates and those anchor
[38:17] rates help defend the yield curve and
[38:19] yield curve control operations help
[38:21] defend the yield curve. There's nobody
[38:23] to play defense. There's no anchor rate
[38:25] to slow the process down in the internet
[38:27] economy. It is a true free market yield
[38:29] curve. And this revolution, this
[38:32] financial revolution that empowers
[38:34] people is based off of finance. It's not
[38:36] just money. It's finance, too, because
[38:39] businesses need to be able to borrow
[38:40] against their cash flows. People need to
[38:43] be able to borrow against their Bitcoin.
[38:45] And and if they can't, then we're we're
[38:47] not going to get the velocity that we
[38:49] need within the economy. But we will get
[38:51] that velocity when we have these
[38:53] financial products. And these financial
[38:55] products will empower you rather than
[38:57] extract value from you. And when we flip
[38:59] that paradigm, I think we're going to
[39:01] see economic growth that we never
[39:03] thought conceivable. Because in the fiat
[39:05] system, the fiat system is literally
[39:07] designed to yield farm or or harvest
[39:11] that energy. Like the matrix, the system
[39:13] is literally taking all of the value
[39:15] that you give and through taxes and
[39:18] through deficit spending, sucking that
[39:20] value out of you. But in a Bitcoin
[39:23] standard, in a true free market economy
[39:25] with a hard money layer zero, all of the
[39:28] value that you deliver will be yours. So
[39:30] when you have that value, you'll be able
[39:32] to spend it back into the economy.
[39:34] You're not giving up your right to spend
[39:36] into the economy and assigning it to the
[39:38] government. You yourself will spend it
[39:41] into the economy. And I think everybody
[39:43] would agree that the best capital
[39:45] allocators are the ones who deliver
[39:47] value to the economy, not the ones who
[39:49] suck and extract value from the economy.
[39:51] Which is why we see so much waste in the
[39:53] government. They don't deliver value,
[39:54] they extract it. But Bitcoiners who
[39:56] deliver value, when they start spending
[39:58] their purchasing power into the economy,
[40:00] the whole world will change and it will
[40:02] change for the better. quality will go
[40:04] up, not just of life and standard of
[40:06] living, but quality of of goods and
[40:08] services. Customer service will go up. I
[40:10] know here in the United States, I went
[40:11] out to dinner with my family the other
[40:13] night and it was like seven of us and it
[40:16] was like $700 and something dollars for
[40:18] dinner before the tip. And I'm like, how
[40:21] do people do this? Like, how how is this
[40:24] affordable? And and in a Bitcoin
[40:26] standard, those prices just keep going
[40:27] down and down and down. Family dinners
[40:29] become more and more affordable. being
[40:31] being be able to be a blessing to
[40:33] somebody in need becomes more and more
[40:35] affordable. So all these things people
[40:37] don't really think money and finance fit
[40:39] into philanthropy, but they really do.
[40:42] Money and finance fit into philanthropy.
[40:44] And the future that Michael Sailor and
[40:46] Micro Strategy and People's Reserve and
[40:49] Metaplanet and these Bitcoin Treasury
[40:51] companies are seeking to build is a
[40:54] better, stronger, more secure future.
[40:56] Not just immediately for ourselves, but
[40:58] most importantly for our children. Let's
[41:00] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[41:03] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[41:06] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[41:09] are the most amazing, the most elegant
[41:12] way of showing that you are a true
[41:14] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[41:17] dropped a completely new and amazing
[41:20] Genesis edition of their watch
[41:22] collections. You have the date of the
[41:25] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[41:28] and of course also the block height and
[41:31] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[41:34] the level of detail they put in in this
[41:37] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[41:39] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[41:42] down in the descriptions. I love those
[41:44] watches so so much. And now if you have
[41:48] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[41:50] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[41:52] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[41:54] to deal with that. The first way is you
[41:57] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[41:59] entry for you to get into the
[42:01] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[42:05] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[42:07] super simple and secure way. And if you
[42:10] check out the link in the description,
[42:12] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[42:15] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[42:18] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[42:21] partner in terms of how to get the most
[42:24] out of your sovereignty. They will
[42:27] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[42:30] that is perfect for your individual
[42:33] situation. They will show you how you
[42:35] can secure your own devices. Securing
[42:38] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[42:40] have to keep all your devices secure.
[42:42] One topic that is overlooked often is
[42:45] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[42:47] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[42:50] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[42:53] place already? And last but not least,
[42:55] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[42:57] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[42:59] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[43:04] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[43:07] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[43:10] be for the first time ever speaking at
[43:12] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[43:15] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[43:18] really looking forward to seeing all of
[43:20] you there. You can get your ticket in
[43:22] the link down in the description of
[43:24] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[43:27] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[43:30] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[43:32] there. That's such a such a true
[43:34] message. Like Bitcoin really changes
[43:37] something. And I I always describe it as
[43:39] a uh Bitcoin as a fork in the road of
[43:42] human civilization because there are
[43:44] certain innovations like the printing
[43:47] press, like electricity, like the
[43:50] electronical telegraph that just change
[43:53] the outlook for human
[43:56] civilization so so so fundamentally that
[44:00] it's a fork in the road. So like it's
[44:02] like the other way is no longer going.
[44:05] It's a whole whole new uh era of of of
[44:08] how how we do things and it's there's
[44:12] like like 50 topics that I want to go go
[44:15] to. Uh I want I just want to note this
[44:18] for the people because uh you you have
[44:21] been on two times before and we I think
[44:22] we laid the
[44:24] groundwork do a lot of it uh in the
[44:26] previous episodes. So like this the the
[44:28] first one up here is the first one and
[44:30] then this is the second one. Uh I I've I
[44:34] see that we went from 1 hour
[44:36] conversation to one and a half hours.
[44:37] Maybe we go live today with two hours.
[44:40] Let's see how how long we do. Um but
[44:44] yeah, so like for people that are
[44:45] wondering uh how the those episodes are
[44:48] called because sometimes they are like
[44:49] harder to find uh with like almost 500
[44:52] episodes now. Um but it's super super
[44:55] super important that we not only uh talk
[44:59] about the money aspect in Bitcoin but
[45:02] there is a real shift in society
[45:03] happening because of bet because of
[45:06] Bitcoin and this actually brings good
[45:09] things to
[45:11] society other than yeah we have now a
[45:14] money that works that if that makes
[45:17] sense. Yeah. And it makes perfect sense.
[45:19] And it and what's exciting is that it
[45:21] starts with money and finance. So it's
[45:24] weird that you know the Bible says that
[45:26] the love of money is the root of all
[45:29] evil. Isn't that interesting? Like just
[45:31] the concept of somebody being addicted
[45:34] to money and the ability to manipulate
[45:38] reality with their money actually is the
[45:40] root of evil. So when you detach that
[45:43] and that doesn't mean people aren't
[45:45] going to love money. Like Bitcoin is not
[45:46] going to fix people, right? Like sin is
[45:49] a spiritual human problem, not a money
[45:52] problem. So you're still going to have
[45:53] people that love Bitcoin and try to use
[45:55] Bitcoin and its purchasing power to
[45:58] manipulate reality around them and and
[46:01] forcing their own will into their life
[46:04] rather than yielding that will to the
[46:06] Lord. So there's you're not going to get
[46:08] rid of that. But it is amazing that I
[46:12] think the vast majority of Bitcoiners, I
[46:13] mean, of all the Bitcoiners I've met,
[46:16] very few of them come off loving money.
[46:18] Very, they love Bitcoin so much because
[46:21] they actually hate money. It's they hate
[46:24] fiat currency. They hate central
[46:26] banking. They hate manipulation of
[46:28] interest rates. They hate extracting
[46:30] value from the poorest people of
[46:31] society. They hate that the wealth gap
[46:34] between the 1% and the normal person is
[46:36] growing. They hate that so much that it
[46:39] drives them to love Bitcoin because it
[46:40] solves that problem. So I think you know
[46:43] the the the vast majority of problems we
[46:45] see today are sourced in the actual fiat
[46:48] system itself and that translates to a
[46:51] better world. But what makes me so
[46:52] excited is that Bitcoin can be
[46:54] integrated. We don't need to start over
[46:57] and I think a lot of people
[46:58] misunderstand that. Like when I talk to
[46:59] people a lot of people think it's like a
[47:01] zero or a one, right? It's like it's
[47:04] fiat currency or it's Bitcoin. And if we
[47:06] switch to Bitcoin, well, it's going to
[47:08] be the apocalypse. All the systems are
[47:10] going to break down. The banks are going
[47:11] to break down. Everything's going to
[47:13] break. Businesses will break down. The
[47:14] stock market's going to crash. And we
[47:16] have to start over from zero with
[47:18] Bitcoin. I don't think that's what's
[47:20] happening. And I don't think there's a
[47:21] way to draw that logical conclusion. I
[47:24] think that that definitely could have
[47:26] happened if people's if um if the people
[47:29] stood up and said, you know, we don't
[47:30] trust this system and we're done with
[47:32] it. then that absolutely could happen
[47:34] and it could still happen if things
[47:35] change. But right now, in my opinion, it
[47:38] seems that we're on track to integrate
[47:40] Bitcoin into the fiat system and then
[47:43] slowly over time just get rid of those
[47:46] wicked practices that have led to the
[47:50] gap in wealth and the continued value
[47:51] extraction that we see, which means that
[47:53] we can have a peaceful transition. And
[47:55] that's really important. I mean, I don't
[47:57] I don't want anything but peace. Bitcoin
[48:00] is orange peace. it. That's why I do
[48:02] that my little emojis, my orange peace,
[48:04] love. I do that all the time because
[48:06] Bitcoin is the peaceful revolution. It
[48:08] is the passive peaceful way to protest
[48:12] against the system that has been
[48:14] designed and leveraged against you. And
[48:16] now people are waking up to that and
[48:19] businesses are waking up to that. We can
[48:21] actually transition into that. And you
[48:23] know, people's reserve, a lot of people
[48:24] get uh excited about our mortgage
[48:26] product because they want to buy a home
[48:28] and they've been responsible savers of
[48:30] Bitcoin and they want to buy their home
[48:31] without selling their Bitcoin. So, it's
[48:32] a no-brainer. Um, you know, that was my
[48:35] big problem. I bought I'd be a lot
[48:36] wealthier today if I didn't spend 100
[48:38] Bitcoin on my home. So, you know, you
[48:40] never want to sell your Bitcoin for real
[48:42] estate, but you want to access that
[48:45] trapped equity and be able to spend it
[48:47] into reality. And you do that by
[48:49] borrowing dollars against it. So, that's
[48:52] a really important concept, but what
[48:53] people are missing here is how fast
[48:56] adoption is going to go with products
[48:58] like Bitcoin's uh like People's
[49:00] Reserves, Bitcoin Bond. We've we've
[49:02] developed a principal protected note
[49:05] that allows a business small and
[49:08] medium-sized business. So, for business
[49:09] owners listening to this show,
[49:11] especially if you're a Bitcoiner, the
[49:13] number one thing in your mind is how do
[49:14] I accumulate more Bitcoin? I want
[49:16] Bitcoin on my balance sheet. But at the
[49:19] same time, your business is growing. You
[49:22] need to hire more employees. You need to
[49:24] buy more equipment. You need to increase
[49:26] supply so that you can feed demand. So,
[49:29] there's not much room on that balance
[49:31] sheet for taking that profit and turning
[49:34] it into Bitcoin and then holding that
[49:36] Bitcoin on your balance sheet as tracked
[49:38] equity because that's equity that you
[49:40] could have rolled into the expansion of
[49:42] your business. So for small and
[49:44] medium-sized business owners, I think
[49:46] the People's Reserve Bitcoin bond is
[49:48] going to accelerate adoption at a rate
[49:51] and pace that uh has has not been
[49:54] considered thus far. And the reason is
[49:55] is because if you're a business owner
[49:57] and you have and you and let's say for
[49:59] the quarter you have a million dollars
[50:01] of of of
[50:03] profit, most business owners are going
[50:05] to take a large chunk of that and
[50:07] reinvest it in the business. So let's
[50:09] say you take half of that, you take
[50:11] 500,000, you reinvest it in your
[50:12] business. Maybe you onboard a new
[50:14] employee or you buy rights to service a
[50:16] new zip code or whatever it is and you
[50:19] expand your business. The other 500,000
[50:21] you want to put into your savings. Well,
[50:23] companies are smart enough to know, you
[50:25] know, I can't really save in the
[50:27] treasuries. But the the kicker here is
[50:28] that if you take that 500,000, you buy a
[50:30] treasury, you can use that cash flow
[50:32] without giving up principle, right? You
[50:34] can use that cash flow to help finance
[50:35] your business costs. So, your savings is
[50:38] producing something for you. If you put
[50:40] it in Bitcoin, yeah, the value can go
[50:42] up, but you really don't want to spend
[50:43] it, right? You can't spend it. It's
[50:45] trapped equity on your balance sheet.
[50:47] The P the People's Reserve Bitcoin bond
[50:49] is designed to unlock that equity. So if
[50:51] you take that $500,000 and you buy the
[50:53] principal protected note, one thing is
[50:56] you know for sure after five years even
[50:58] if Bitcoin goes to zero after five years
[51:01] the the allocation of in that note
[51:03] that's in treasuries the the maturation
[51:06] value plus the interest paid over that
[51:08] 5year note time will equal your
[51:10] principal investment which was the
[51:11] 500,000. So, if you're a business and
[51:14] you're a little bit nervous because
[51:15] you're a business owner and you're not a
[51:17] Bitcoiner, but you but you want to get
[51:19] exposure to Bitcoin on your balance
[51:20] sheet, this is a solution for you. If
[51:22] you're a business that's growing and
[51:24] needs to reallocate uh in a way that you
[51:27] don't trap equity on your balance sheet,
[51:28] this is a solution for you. And I think
[51:30] this is going to accelerate adoption on
[51:33] the small and medium side. We already
[51:34] see adoption accelerating on the on the
[51:37] corporate side, right? I mean, we have
[51:38] publicly traded companies that are
[51:40] coming into existence simply to acquire
[51:42] Bitcoin. That's the only thing they do
[51:44] is buy Bitcoin. So, the institutional
[51:46] side of this is is already going full
[51:49] steam. But the small and medium-sized
[51:51] businesses are struggling because of
[51:53] those problems and those are the
[51:55] problems that we focus on. So when I say
[51:56] financial engineering for retail, when
[51:58] it comes to the business side of this,
[52:00] yes, we have institutional and corporate
[52:01] products, but we also have small and
[52:03] medium-sized business products to help
[52:05] them accelerate adoption, to help them
[52:08] create demand on Bitcoin, but more
[52:10] importantly to be empowered by their
[52:12] responsible saving in Bitcoin. Because
[52:14] when you have a principal protected
[52:16] note, you can post that note at people's
[52:18] reserve as collateral and we will treat
[52:21] it as pristine collateral. So now, if
[52:23] you need to tap into that $500,000 for
[52:25] whatever reason, you don't have to sell
[52:27] the Bitcoin so that you can hire this
[52:28] employee that you never you you gave
[52:30] this guy the offer. You never thought
[52:32] you were going to get him. He agreed.
[52:33] Now he's coming to work with you, but
[52:35] you need to pay him. So, you need to
[52:36] liquidate your Bitcoin. No, you take the
[52:38] principal protected note. You take the
[52:39] Bitcoin bond, you post it as collateral,
[52:41] you borrow against it to pay that guy,
[52:43] and then over time, you use the cash
[52:45] flows from the business to pay off that
[52:47] debt. At the end, you have all of your
[52:49] Bitcoin, the guy working for you, and
[52:52] you get the best of both worlds. So,
[52:54] these types of solutions at the small
[52:56] and medium-siz business level, I think,
[52:58] are just as important as the solutions
[53:01] that we see coming from the Bitcoin
[53:03] treasury companies for the institution
[53:04] and corporate level. And the and the
[53:06] small guy adds up. You know, I like it I
[53:08] like to compare it like this. the the
[53:10] tax brackets in the United States. If
[53:13] you took all of the wealth of the of the
[53:15] top 0.1% of the people of those tax
[53:18] brackets, it wouldn't even make a dent
[53:20] in the in the in the debt. Like it would
[53:23] just it would you know like the Elon
[53:24] Musk is worth like half a trillion,
[53:26] right? So you take Elon Musk and the top
[53:28] 50 below him, you're barely going to
[53:30] make a debt in $36 trillion. So the
[53:32] amount of taxes they're paying is is is
[53:34] small relative to the aggregate amount
[53:38] of the middle class people. So the the
[53:40] the the majority of people who are pay
[53:42] paying in the tax bracket in the middle
[53:44] class, they're the ones who are creating
[53:47] the majority here in the United States
[53:49] of the five to6 trillion dollars of tax
[53:52] revenue. The top 1% are not contributing
[53:54] that much because they have tax shelters
[53:57] because of many different reasons. But
[53:59] even if you just took all of their
[54:00] wealth and you taxed them at 100%, it
[54:03] still wouldn't make a dent. It's it's
[54:05] the vast majority of the middle class
[54:07] people that produce those tax
[54:09] revenues. Likely it is the vast majority
[54:13] of small and medium-sized businesses
[54:15] that represent much more purchasing
[54:17] power than a Bitcoin treasury company.
[54:20] So Sailor has done a great job raising
[54:23] billions of dollars from the marketplace
[54:25] to buy Bitcoin, but when you add
[54:27] together all the small and medium-sized
[54:30] businesses, they're going to produce
[54:32] trillions of dollars of purchasing power
[54:34] demand, not billions of dollars. So it's
[54:38] it it it should not be a class of
[54:41] business that is ignored or looked over.
[54:44] Yes, we want to do it at the corporate
[54:45] and institutional level, but also at the
[54:48] small and mediumsiz business level. When
[54:49] you add up the purchasing power of all
[54:51] those small and medium-sized businesses,
[54:54] it's significant. So, giving them the
[54:56] proper tools that they need to get
[54:57] Bitcoin on their balance sheet and get
[54:59] exposure to Bitcoin in a way that
[55:01] doesn't trap equity, but that empowers
[55:03] them, that is going to lead to massive
[55:06] acceleration of small and medium-sized
[55:08] businesses getting involved in Bitcoin
[55:10] accumulation.
[55:12] That's a it's a really good point. And
[55:15] and on top of that, I guess strategy
[55:17] gets I'm actually curious how what you
[55:20] think about that because they're getting
[55:21] more and more competition in a sense. I
[55:23] mean, Sailor himself wants competition.
[55:25] He wants to more companies buying
[55:27] Bitcoin and doing all the same things.
[55:30] Uh but how do you look at 21 Capital
[55:32] from Czech Mullers and and other
[55:33] companies are kind of doing it? And I
[55:35] think he even went ahead and said he
[55:38] wants to or he thinks that he can
[55:40] accumulate more Bitcoin than uh strategy
[55:43] hasn't surpassed that which is kind of
[55:45] crazy going above the half a million a
[55:48] bitcoin that strategy already has. Yeah,
[55:51] and that's a great question uh because I
[55:53] I I love Sailor and I like Mullers and I
[55:57] think they're they're two top people in
[55:59] the industry. Uh and I hope to be I hope
[56:01] to be swimming in that circle pretty
[56:03] soon with people's reserve because uh
[56:05] you know we have the same vision. We
[56:07] want to perform a reverse merger. We
[56:09] want to be we want to get access to US
[56:11] capital markets and we want to start
[56:13] accumulating Bitcoin. I think the
[56:15] difference of people's reserve and
[56:17] strategy and 21 besides them already
[56:20] completing that process and having
[56:22] access to US capital markets which is a
[56:24] big difference by the way. So, we're
[56:25] very excited to accelerate that and get
[56:28] where we need to be so we can start
[56:29] playing the game. It's one thing to to
[56:31] be playing the game and wanting to play
[56:32] the game. So, we got to get to the point
[56:34] where we're actually playing the game.
[56:35] But when we get there, what
[56:37] differentiates us is that we actually
[56:40] will have an ecosystem through our
[56:43] products and services that produces
[56:45] revenues and then those revenues are
[56:47] going to pass through and eventually be
[56:50] paid as dividends. So, not all Bitcoin
[56:54] treasury companies are in a position
[56:56] where they can actually pay investors
[56:58] dividends. And I think that's really
[56:59] important because although the Bitcoin
[57:03] per share is going up, like I'm very
[57:05] happy with the performance of my Micro
[57:08] Strategy stock and I'm a static that the
[57:10] Bitcoin per share and that Bitcoin yield
[57:13] metric is just performing at a rate that
[57:16] is unbelievable. However, I can't turn
[57:19] my Micro Strategy stock in for that
[57:21] Bitcoin. So, you know, until there comes
[57:24] a day where I can turn my shares into my
[57:26] broker and get Bitcoin sent into my cold
[57:29] wallet, I I think the the thesis is that
[57:32] this is a long-term investment into the
[57:35] into one of the future central banks of
[57:36] the internet economy, which is why I'll
[57:38] never sell my shares because I believe
[57:40] he's going to succeed at that. I mean,
[57:42] he's doing a heck of a job and I and
[57:44] it's going to be hard to c be very hard
[57:46] for anybody to catch him. However, I do
[57:48] think the next evolution of Bitcoin
[57:51] treasury companies is fast approaching
[57:53] and those Bitcoin treasury companies
[57:55] aren't going to be only accumulation
[57:58] engines. They will be accumulation
[58:00] engines as well as profit engines. And
[58:03] from the investor's side, uh, it's very
[58:06] exciting to think about the long-term
[58:08] potential of any Bitcoin treasury
[58:10] company, but also it's
[58:13] very effective to be able to receive a
[58:16] dividend from that company, to be able
[58:18] to receive some sort of cash flow from
[58:20] your investment. So, while you're
[58:22] waiting for that company to turn into
[58:24] the central bank of the internet
[58:25] economy, you're also getting some type
[58:28] of benefit that isn't just based on
[58:30] share price and long-term vision. It's
[58:33] actually based on dividend distribution
[58:36] and having a way to increase your
[58:38] quality of life and standard of living
[58:40] today. And I think there's a place for
[58:42] both of those. There's there's going to
[58:43] be obviously continued interest in the
[58:46] original innovator and the in the in the
[58:48] on top of the shoulders of of which
[58:50] everybody in this industry is building
[58:51] on top of which is Michael Sailor and
[58:53] I'm not going to ever sell my shares.
[58:55] And then there's going to be other
[58:56] companies that come and and mimic that
[58:57] strategy which is what we're seeing now.
[58:59] But I do believe the next evolution of
[59:01] Bitcoin treasury companies is going to
[59:04] have I mean people's reserve may be the
[59:06] first we may not be but if if we can
[59:09] accelerate this timeline we will be the
[59:10] first where we actually have cash flow
[59:15] through our financial engineering
[59:17] operations for retail. So we we can
[59:19] raise capital through our financial
[59:21] engineering for cooper for uh for uh
[59:24] corporations and for institutions. But
[59:28] then the way we deploy that capital
[59:31] doesn't just create Bitcoin yield. It
[59:33] also empowers the ecosystem which allows
[59:36] us to onboard more customers which
[59:38] creates more revenues which then pass
[59:40] through as dividends. And that is going
[59:43] to be like the the perfect sweet spot
[59:45] where you have the long-term Bitcoin
[59:48] treasury company, central bank of the
[59:50] internet economy vision, but then you
[59:52] also have the cash flow to produce a
[59:55] dividend to make your shareholders feel
[59:59] some type of benefit in the now instead
[60:02] of having to put all the benefit in the
[60:04] later because we already have that with
[60:05] our Bitcoin, right? that we buy Bitcoin
[60:08] not so that we can spend it today or
[60:10] tomorrow, but that so that we can have
[60:11] it in the long-term future. So, people
[60:13] who have been saving Bitcoin responsibly
[60:15] for a very long time. We don't we don't
[60:18] ever want to sell our we want to hand
[60:20] off our Bitcoin. We want to put our
[60:21] Bitcoin into a trust and then make sure
[60:23] that trust takes care of our family for
[60:24] generations and generations to come.
[60:26] That's that's a Bitcoiner's mindset. But
[60:29] at at the same time, do I need to have a
[60:32] dual strategy on this? Do I need to have
[60:33] a a leveraged strategy on the long term
[60:37] with shares and Bitcoin? Can't Bitcoin
[60:39] just do that and then with my shares, I
[60:41] can leverage those to create a little
[60:44] bit of cash flow with the long term
[60:47] because it's it's interesting like the
[60:49] dynamics. I'm sure we're going to see a
[60:51] bunch of financial engineering from all
[60:53] the Bitcoin treasury companies and
[60:55] they're going to do exactly what Michael
[60:56] did. They're just going to they're going
[60:57] to copy what he did because what he's
[60:58] done is genius. And you're going to see
[61:00] convertibles, you're going to see
[61:01] preferreds, you're going to see a whole
[61:02] bunch of different options to facilitate
[61:05] solutions that are that that are solving
[61:08] problems faced by different pools of
[61:10] liquidity in the marketplace. And that's
[61:12] what Michael is doing. And other
[61:14] treasury companies will do that. But at
[61:16] some point in time, there needs to be a
[61:18] way to get exposure to a Bitcoin
[61:20] treasury company that wants to be a
[61:22] central bank of the internet economy,
[61:24] but also has the means to pay a dividend
[61:27] so that you can increase your quality of
[61:28] life and standard of living today with
[61:30] the distribution of that dividend and
[61:33] then bank on the future of tomorrow with
[61:34] your Bitcoin savings. And that's what I
[61:37] that's what I'm so excited about
[61:38] People's Reserve because that's that's
[61:40] what differentiates us. our our mindset
[61:43] is not fullon Bitcoin accumulation.
[61:46] Absolutely. It's aggressive Bitcoin
[61:48] accumulation, but at the same time, it's
[61:50] also aggressive dividend distribution so
[61:53] that our shareholders can feel the
[61:55] benefit today and win in the long term
[61:58] with our vision and their Bitcoin
[62:00] savings. kind of marrying both visions
[62:04] of the traditional market and a
[62:05] traditional Bitcoin hodddler together in
[62:08] a way that delivers long-term value and
[62:11] value today.
[62:13] That's that's that's really really I I I
[62:17] love that future. I I love where where
[62:19] this is going and I'm really looking
[62:20] forward I'm I'm also really looking
[62:22] forward to um looking back at people
[62:26] reserves and what you're doing now and
[62:28] seeing in 10 years looking back at this
[62:31] podcast and see how how this develops.
[62:33] I'm already looking at forward at this
[62:35] episode and and and seeing how how it
[62:37] developed.
[62:38] Yeah, that'll probably be our uh our
[62:41] 10th episode, right?
[62:44] Well, 20th. Let's see. 20th episode.
[62:47] Yeah, I see. Um I I I want to touch on
[62:50] one more thing before we come to the end
[62:51] routine. um you mentioned a peaceful
[62:54] transition and I was always on the fence
[62:57] of like oh do we have a peaceful or non
[62:59] non- peaceful uh transition and since
[63:03] kind of 2094 and 205 I changed my my
[63:06] mind completely and I'm pretty pretty
[63:09] sure we have a peaceful transition out
[63:11] of two reasons because the biggest world
[63:14] power with the USA is now fullon
[63:18] acceptable with Bitcoin before 2094 I
[63:22] was never really sure like, oh, they
[63:24] haven't even an ETF. Maybe they declare
[63:26] war on Bitcoin like it it was not it was
[63:29] not impossible that had that happens.
[63:31] But now with the ETF and especially now
[63:34] with Trump saying strategic Bitcoin
[63:36] reserve with so many friendly Bitcoin
[63:39] friendly uh policies, it's for me
[63:42] completely out of the question that we
[63:45] do not have a peaceful transition. We
[63:47] will have a peaceful transition if
[63:50] nothing changes. If if the USA all of
[63:52] the sudden says, "Oh, like we hate
[63:53] Bitcoin and and we that if that happens,
[63:57] even though I don't put any thing on
[64:00] that, yeah, maybe maybe we have a non
[64:03] not as peaceful transition. Um, but I'm
[64:06] really curious what you think on the
[64:08] strategic Bitcoin reserve and what what
[64:11] the implications of that is and what
[64:15] what you're kind of seeing from uh
[64:18] nation states stacking Bitcoin on
[64:20] individuals. We talking individuals
[64:22] buying homes. We talk about uh big
[64:24] companies. Uh but the the real end boss
[64:27] that I have a lot of money endless money
[64:30] basically is basically printing money to
[64:32] to buy Bitcoin the the USA with the Fed.
[64:36] Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So when we talk
[64:38] about sovereign Bitcoin
[64:40] accumulation, this
[64:43] is this is the biggest warning bell that
[64:46] there is. And we see countries are they
[64:49] see there's multiple ways to accumulate
[64:51] Bitcoin. You can accumulate Bitcoin
[64:53] through taxes. You can accumulate
[64:54] Bitcoin through mining. You can
[64:56] accumulate Bitcoin through buying it in
[64:58] the spot market. So those are the three
[65:01] main ways that governments can acquire
[65:04] Bitcoin. So here in the United States, I
[65:06] think it's it's really important that we
[65:09] get Trump's executive order actually
[65:12] codified into legislation so that it
[65:14] becomes law and and by law we have a
[65:17] strategic Bitcoin reserve. And you know,
[65:20] some of the handcuffs that come with the
[65:21] strategic Bitcoin reserve include once
[65:23] you buy it, you can't touch it for I
[65:25] think 10 or 20 years and then when you
[65:28] do sell it, the proceeds from that sale
[65:30] have to pay down the national debt. So,
[65:32] you know, these are these are good
[65:33] handcuffs that we need because we're not
[65:35] China. And every four years, we're going
[65:38] to see uh an administration change and
[65:40] then every two years we're going to see
[65:42] the the the lower levels of of of
[65:45] Congress and and stuff change. So, we
[65:48] have a lot of change within our system.
[65:50] So, it makes perfect sense to put these
[65:51] handcuffs in there because you don't
[65:53] want there to be a change that disagrees
[65:55] with you and then ruins all of that hard
[65:57] work. Um, so the strategic Bitcoin
[66:00] reserve is of the utmost importance. But
[66:03] I've been saying this for a while and I
[66:05] I thought a while back I was I was
[66:08] nominated to to sit on
[66:10] um RFK's Council of Economic Advisors
[66:14] and I I finished eight out of like
[66:16] hundreds of people and I never heard
[66:17] from them which was really disappointing
[66:19] because I don't know they contacted me
[66:21] and said you've been nominated and then
[66:23] I I told some people to vote and we
[66:25] voted we did really well. I never even
[66:26] got I never heard back from them at all.
[66:29] But if I did, one thing that I would be
[66:31] pushing for today is the Bitcoin
[66:34] recapitalization fund because we don't
[66:36] just need a strategic Bitcoin reserve.
[66:39] The strategic Bitcoin reserve is really
[66:41] important because that is your long-term
[66:43] huddle. That is that is the coins that
[66:45] we are accumulating for future
[66:47] generations. Those are the coins that we
[66:49] are accumulating so that the asset side
[66:51] of our balance sheet, the growth of that
[66:54] side of our balance sheet can outpace
[66:56] the growth of liabilities. So you could
[66:58] imagine if you if you work a regular job
[67:01] and you go from making 60,000 to
[67:03] $600,000 a year, then you're going to
[67:06] have a much stronger credit score,
[67:07] right? Because now you have a lot more
[67:09] income. So your credit score is going to
[67:10] go up. Your debt to income ratios are
[67:12] going to go down. You're going to be in
[67:12] a stronger financial position. And we've
[67:15] seen this with El Salvador. El Salvador
[67:17] added Bitcoin to their balance sheet.
[67:18] They had some of the best trad
[67:20] performing bonds in the world and and
[67:22] and banks that don't like them had to
[67:25] increase their credit ratings because
[67:26] they were getting into a stronger credit
[67:28] position thanks to their accumulation of
[67:30] Bitcoin. So the strategic Bitcoin
[67:32] reserve is super important and I like
[67:34] the way the law is written. However,
[67:37] this is about innovation. This is about
[67:38] the United States maintaining its
[67:41] financial leadership throughout the
[67:43] world. There is the internet economy
[67:45] domain. No, no one country can control
[67:47] it or out compete it. Therefore, someone
[67:50] must step up in an attempt to lead it.
[67:53] And if you're going to lead the internet
[67:54] economy, you must lead in innovation.
[67:57] You cannot pull a China and ban mining.
[68:00] You cannot pull u uh another I don't
[68:04] even know a good example. You cannot
[68:05] pull a country that is going to turn off
[68:08] innovation and not be open to
[68:09] integrating Bitcoin. And I and that's
[68:12] why I love your point uh the United
[68:14] States opening up its doors and and
[68:17] choosing which path it was going to go
[68:19] at this fork in the road. Thank God they
[68:21] chose the fork where we chose
[68:23] innovation, we chose acceptance, we
[68:25] chose adoption, we chose a we're trying
[68:28] to figure this out, right? But as we're
[68:30] trying to figure this out and we're
[68:31] trying to get the strategic Bitcoin
[68:33] reserve codified into law, there needs
[68:36] to be a secondary push and that
[68:37] secondary push is for the Bitcoin
[68:39] recapitalization fund. And what we can
[68:41] do, like one of the ideas that I had
[68:43] before was the United States of America
[68:45] is is charging tariffs right now, right?
[68:47] Donald Trump is charging tariffs. Well,
[68:51] Trump should just say, "Okay, if you're
[68:52] going to pay your tariffs in dollars,
[68:54] here's the here's the tariff rate."
[68:56] However, if you're going to pay tariffs
[68:58] in Bitcoin, we'll give you a discount to
[69:00] that tariff rate, and you'll pay this
[69:02] lower tariff rate because you're making
[69:04] payment in Bitcoin. And then we can
[69:06] accumulate all the tariff payments that
[69:08] are made in Bitcoin into the Bitcoin
[69:10] recapitalization fund. And the goal of
[69:12] the Bitcoin recapitalization fund is to
[69:15] recapitalize the republic. A lot if you
[69:18] look in the United States and you look
[69:19] at our infrastructure and then you
[69:21] travel to other first world countries
[69:22] and you look at their infrastructure. I
[69:24] just saw in China they have a a magnetic
[69:27] train that goes 620 m hour. That's
[69:31] faster than a commercial airliner. So in
[69:34] China, they're using magnetic trains and
[69:36] traveling faster than we are we here are
[69:38] in the United States using jetliners.
[69:41] Where is our infrastructure? Where is
[69:43] our train infrastructure? Where is our
[69:46] city infrastructure? Why are we lagging
[69:49] behind as a global leader? Why are why
[69:51] is our infrastructure lagging behind
[69:54] other competitive countries, other
[69:56] countries that are competing to be at
[69:58] the top of the world? Why? How? How is
[70:01] that? We spent $36 trillion. We promised
[70:04] to pay another $220 trillion. Where the
[70:07] hell did the money go? And I think what
[70:09] Elon Musk is doing with Doge is starting
[70:11] to get the answer to some of those
[70:12] questions. And unfortunately, the
[70:15] lawyers came to the conclusion that,
[70:16] well, hey, if the government sends
[70:18] people money and they spend that money,
[70:19] that's not fraud. It's just waste. It's
[70:21] the government's money for sending it
[70:22] out in the first place. So, we're not
[70:24] going to see those arrests. We're not
[70:25] going to see people get in trouble like
[70:27] we wanted to. we're going to see the
[70:29] waste come to an end, which I think is
[70:31] of the utmost importance, but we have to
[70:34] figure out ways to innovate. So if we
[70:36] can cut waste and limit the growth of
[70:38] liabilities, accelerate growth of assets
[70:41] through the strategic Bitcoin reserve,
[70:43] but then innovate through the through
[70:45] the Bitcoin recapitalization fund,
[70:47] issuing Bitcoin bonds, issuing municipal
[70:50] Bitcoin bonds so that we can make sure
[70:52] that the liquidity that comes into these
[70:54] products is redistributed directly into
[70:57] the smaller towns that are that are more
[70:59] easily held accountable. You know, a lot
[71:01] of people who support Trump see him
[71:03] fighting against the system. And and I
[71:05] personally believe that's accurate, but
[71:07] some people don't believe that. Well,
[71:08] it's much easier to not fight the system
[71:11] if you're doing it at the municipal
[71:13] level because the municipal level
[71:15] politicians are going to be held
[71:16] accountable. It's easier to fight your
[71:18] local politicians. I shouldn't say the
[71:20] word fight. You don't need to. It's
[71:21] easier to negotiate and and work with
[71:24] your local politicians than it is to
[71:27] fight the system. than it is to work
[71:29] with the system, right? Because as soon
[71:31] as you start to work with the system,
[71:32] you need lobbying dollars and you need
[71:34] millions of dollars. But when you're
[71:36] working with your local municipality,
[71:38] it's it's a negotiation. You're talking
[71:40] to your neighbor. You're not talking to
[71:42] a a stateide rep or a federal rep.
[71:45] You're talking to your neighbor. And I
[71:47] think that is how we recapitalize the
[71:49] republic. We take some of the liquidity
[71:51] flowing into the federal system and
[71:53] redirect it into the states and kind of
[71:56] let Thomas Jefferson's original vision
[71:59] of states solving these local problems
[72:02] where they're more local to the problem
[72:04] and can come up with better solutions to
[72:06] come up a and go ahead and do those
[72:08] solutions. But how do we finance it?
[72:10] through municipal Bitcoin bonds, through
[72:12] the strategic Bitcoin recapitalization
[72:14] fund that is specifically used just like
[72:17] the SBR comes with the handcuffs, the
[72:20] strategic recapitalization fund. This it
[72:22] comes with a a a rule to innovate. Like
[72:26] you're not just going to accumulate
[72:27] Bitcoin. You're going to find ways to
[72:29] use Bitcoin to empower we the people.
[72:32] You're going to find ways to deploy this
[72:33] Bitcoin capital to attract liquidity to
[72:36] the United States, attract investment to
[72:38] the United States, to build out
[72:40] infrastructure, to create manufacturing
[72:42] jobs, to do all the things that we
[72:44] wouldn't be able to do with a fiat
[72:46] system, leverage the internet economy,
[72:49] leverage engineered money to empower
[72:52] your constituents, to empower we the
[72:54] people to increase quality of life and
[72:57] standard of living through municipal
[72:59] Bitcoin bonds and through other other
[73:01] options we would have through that
[73:03] recapitalization fund. So I think yeah,
[73:05] you're right. The the United States
[73:07] embracing Bitcoin is a huge first step,
[73:10] but we also must embrace the internet
[73:13] economy and then be motivated enough to
[73:16] step up and take a leadership role,
[73:19] which is going to require innovation.
[73:20] And I can tell you right now, if we
[73:22] don't do it, other countries will. And
[73:25] we definitely want to be the first
[73:27] country to step up and take the lead and
[73:29] set the precedent. And the clock is
[73:31] ticking because as we accelerate up this
[73:34] scurve of adoption we talked about
[73:35] earlier, other countries are going to
[73:37] step up because of the rate and pace of
[73:39] their own adoption. We see the kingdom
[73:41] of Bhutan is mining Bitcoin. They they
[73:44] took their mining profits and now they
[73:46] built a big international airport. So
[73:48] this is a big use case study of how you
[73:50] could acquire Bitcoin and then promote
[73:54] infrastructure building and then that
[73:56] infrastructure that airport people are
[73:57] going to come in and out of that
[73:58] airport. It's going to generate revenues
[74:00] and tax revenues. It's going to bring in
[74:01] visitors. It's going to bring more
[74:03] people into the country into the local
[74:04] economy. That's what this is all about.
[74:06] Because even Bitcoin at the top of the
[74:08] Scurve, at the top of the S-curve,
[74:11] Bitcoin's value is tethered to economic
[74:14] value. So if the economy is shrinking,
[74:16] the value of Bitcoin will shrink. If the
[74:18] economy is expanding, the the value of
[74:20] Bitcoin will expand. So the long-term
[74:23] function of Bitcoin is to be a
[74:25] measurement or metric on the true
[74:28] performance of the economy. And in order
[74:31] to get the best possible performance out
[74:32] of the economy, we must be willing to
[74:35] innovate and reinvest into the economy.
[74:38] So just like a small and medium-sized
[74:40] business must properly manage revenues
[74:42] and reinvest in the business to grow it,
[74:44] a country must reinvest its revenues to
[74:47] grow infrastructure to increase quality
[74:49] of life and standard of living living to
[74:52] incentivize Bitcoiners who create value
[74:54] to come live in your state or in your
[74:57] country. That's where this is all going.
[74:59] And it starts with the strategic Bitcoin
[75:01] reserve. It accelerates with the
[75:03] recapitalization fund and it ends up
[75:06] with us being a innovative leader in the
[75:09] internet economy guaranteeing that we
[75:12] play a role in the future of finance and
[75:14] leverage those financial products to
[75:16] empower our own people.
[75:19] I'm I'm calling it now. Uh we have now
[75:22] the the last Trump term and then we have
[75:25] probably two terms of JD Vance and then
[75:27] 2036 JDK for president, I would say.
[75:32] Yeah. I I mean, yeah, I I hope you're
[75:34] right. And I think I think we're going
[75:36] to get it here. I Trump really did a
[75:38] good job of allowing that short-term
[75:41] pain to take place in the very beginning
[75:43] of his uh term. So, now that we've seen
[75:46] this big uh bounce and I think we're
[75:49] going to see a big acceleration in the
[75:51] coming weeks, uh and that's and that's
[75:53] not to say there's going to be real
[75:54] value growth, right? We're going to see
[75:55] nominal value growth. So, if you're
[75:57] sitting in the S&P nominally, you're
[76:00] going to get richer, but in real terms,
[76:01] you're still going to get poor. So, you
[76:03] still need to find the solution to
[76:05] outpace the the the growth of the
[76:07] currency supply with Bitcoin. But yeah,
[76:10] the way that he set this up, we've been
[76:12] through I mean the traditional markets
[76:14] went down almost down to the 200 day uh
[76:16] 200 day moving average. So that you know
[76:19] the last time we were there was when
[76:21] they started raising interest rates and
[76:23] the last time we were there was COVID.
[76:25] So it takes big shifts in market
[76:28] dynamics and market narratives to get
[76:31] prices down to that 200 day moving
[76:33] average. We already have been down to
[76:36] that level and we are now back up almost
[76:38] making new all-time highs. So, I think
[76:40] we've had that big sell-off event in the
[76:42] early part of Trump's term. He's going
[76:44] to accelerate and push as hard as he can
[76:46] to create nominal growth through the
[76:48] remainder of his term. That's going to
[76:50] usher in, as you said, the JD Vance
[76:52] error. And and and who knows when we get
[76:54] there, but he could probably get a
[76:56] double term and do eight years. And if
[76:58] we have these remaining years plus those
[77:01] eight years and the war on crypto
[77:03] doesn't come back from the people who
[77:05] are in control of the other side
[77:07] unfortunately it's becoming more and
[77:09] more bipartisan thankfully. You know
[77:11] I've talked to people like Dennis Porter
[77:12] at Satoshi Action Fund. Bitcoin unites
[77:14] us more than it separates us. So
[77:16] thankfully we're we're becoming more
[77:18] united around Bitcoin and what it stands
[77:20] for and how it benefits all constituents
[77:23] regardless of their their stance being
[77:26] uh conservative or liberal. doesn't
[77:28] really matter. It unites everybody. So,
[77:30] we need to embrace that uniting function
[77:33] and take advantage of the next 11 years
[77:36] to make sure that we innovate and that
[77:38] we as aggressively as we possibly can
[77:42] step up and and to our the best of our
[77:44] ability take the lead in the internet
[77:47] economy and and I also think that that
[77:49] comes with Bitcoin education. So, you
[77:51] know, the government the government
[77:52] wants to tell you everything. Why why
[77:53] can't they teach you a little bit about
[77:55] Bitcoin, too?
[77:57] Absolutely. And after Jade events, as I
[77:59] said, CJ J
[78:01] Constantinos. I would love to see that.
[78:04] Um, really cool. Then, um, we, by the
[78:07] way, is it something you you you even
[78:09] would like to do? Oh, no. Absolutely
[78:12] not. Absolutely not. Building People's
[78:14] Reserve has been, um, one of the
[78:17] toughest toughest things I've ever done
[78:20] in my life.
[78:21] And I feel called to it. And if I wasn't
[78:25] called to it, I would have left a long
[78:27] time ago. The amount of time and energy
[78:29] that goes into everything that we've
[78:31] done over the last four years um is is
[78:35] is very taxing and very draining. But if
[78:39] you feel called to it, that taxing and
[78:41] draining is actually rewarding. So, I I
[78:43] feel very well rewarded for the time and
[78:46] energy I've put into people's reserve
[78:48] because I know the value that we're
[78:50] going to deliver to people and I know
[78:52] that our ethos that Bitcoin maxi mindset
[78:55] where it's about orange peace love where
[78:58] we deliver value to you instead of
[78:59] extract value from you. We are going to
[79:02] set the bar. We are going to set the
[79:04] standard of what a business relationship
[79:07] should look like in a Bitcoin standard
[79:09] world where you're not a profit
[79:11] maximalist. you're a relationship
[79:13] maximalist. And as we transition into
[79:17] the the Bitcoin standard, the the
[79:20] companies who have that mindset are
[79:22] going to be around for a really long
[79:24] time. And the companies who are still
[79:26] holding on to that value extraction
[79:28] model that came with the fiat system. I
[79:31] mean, they're still going to be there
[79:32] because some of them have acquired large
[79:34] sums of of money and even are going to
[79:36] be able to acquire large sums of
[79:37] Bitcoin, but they're not going to
[79:38] perform as well because consumers
[79:40] themselves are going to start waking up
[79:42] to how they should be treated by a
[79:45] company and to the fact that they're
[79:46] getting value extracted from them
[79:48] instead of delivered to them. So, the
[79:50] the fact that we get to flip the script
[79:52] and kind of lead the way uh in the
[79:55] orange piece love narrative, that has
[79:58] been super rewarding for me. but to move
[80:00] on and do what Trump does right now.
[80:02] There is no amount of money, there is no
[80:06] essay or or grouping of words that could
[80:09] convince me to give up more time and
[80:12] energy uh from my family. So, I look
[80:14] forward to launching People's Reserve
[80:16] and continuing to put in large amounts
[80:18] of time and energy into the growth of
[80:20] the company uh and into the global
[80:22] adoption of Bitcoin and into the pushing
[80:26] Bitcoin education to all corners of the
[80:28] earth. Uh and I feel called to do that.
[80:31] But anything besides that, I really feel
[80:33] like I wouldn't be my heart wouldn't be
[80:35] in it. Uh and therefore, I wouldn't be
[80:36] able to deliver as much value as I could
[80:39] deliver here uh at People's Reserve.
[80:42] Great answer. I love that. Um, we have
[80:46] uh two end routines. One end routine is
[80:48] always the same question. Uh, and the
[80:50] question is for you. What have you
[80:52] learned since your last appearance on
[80:54] this podcast outside of Bitcoin?
[80:59] Oh, that's a good one.
[81:04] Uh, that's a that's a really good one
[81:06] because Bitcoin is pretty much all I do.
[81:09] There is no outside of Bitcoin for me.
[81:11] Uh, I I learned that um teenage
[81:14] daughters like to talk back uh and that
[81:17] and they're always right. Uh I've
[81:19] learned that uh four and five and
[81:21] six-year-old brothers like to wrestle
[81:23] with each other. Um uh outside of
[81:27] Bitcoin, I don't know. But I I guess if
[81:28] I had to answer the question, I would
[81:30] say it this way. Um I think what's going
[81:33] on right now with the OP return argument
[81:36] is what I've learned is that Bitcoin
[81:39] isn't just code. It's community, right?
[81:42] And that's why it's so important to make
[81:43] sure that you're running a node and that
[81:45] you can signal to the miners and to the
[81:48] marketplace where you stand because
[81:50] people ask like, are they going to vote
[81:52] on it? That like it's an ongoing
[81:54] consensus mechanism. So, you have to
[81:56] signal into that consensus how you feel
[81:59] in order for the market to understand
[82:01] your place and your opinion. So this
[82:03] this argument right now we have with
[82:05] removing the data limits on op returns.
[82:08] I mean a lot of people have been DMing
[82:10] me and say why haven't you spoken about
[82:12] this? But I think this question kind of
[82:14] tease me up perfectly because what I've
[82:16] learned is it's not just about money and
[82:18] it's not just about finance. It's about
[82:20] community and it's about people and it
[82:22] is about consensus and working together.
[82:25] So Bitcoin is not just a savings
[82:27] technology. It's also a voting system.
[82:30] It's also a consensus mechanism that
[82:33] allows humans to come together and
[82:35] signal their beliefs without having as
[82:38] much argument and fighting, right? So,
[82:41] we have to run if you're in Bitcoin, you
[82:43] should run a node. The amount of nodes
[82:44] there are relative to Bitcoin users is
[82:47] not good enough. So, we need to push
[82:49] nodes and we need and people need to
[82:51] understand how to run a node and most
[82:53] importantly, the cost of spinning up a
[82:56] node and the and the technical
[82:58] requirements of that node. itself need
[83:00] to be remained limited. So any type of
[83:03] change to Bitcoin that could add to UTXO
[83:06] bloat by allowing additional data to be
[83:09] kept on chain must be scrutinized. We
[83:13] need to understand that Bitcoin is a
[83:15] monetary technology. Now Satoshi himself
[83:19] put a text message in the first block,
[83:21] right? The the chancellor on the brink
[83:23] of bailouts. So, we know it can be used
[83:27] for that reason, for data storage, but
[83:30] it's a monetary network. And they and
[83:32] and I want to say this because they try
[83:34] to pull economics into this. Yeah, but
[83:36] if they're going to pay to store their
[83:38] data, they should be allowed to do it.
[83:40] That's only true when Bitcoin is at the
[83:42] top of the S-curve. So, my position
[83:44] would be if you want to take away OP
[83:46] return data limits, do it when Bitcoin's
[83:48] at the top of the S-curve. Because at
[83:50] the top of the S-curve, you have taken
[83:52] away all bad actor incentive. You cannot
[83:54] just say that, oh, if it costs money to
[83:58] store data here, then bad people aren't
[84:00] going to store data here, and it's not
[84:02] our job to fill out to to to police
[84:04] those bad people. It's a tough argument
[84:07] because that's partly true. When when
[84:10] those bad actors put in that data and
[84:12] bloat
[84:13] UTXO, they have to pay for it. So,
[84:16] that's not economically sustainable,
[84:18] right? Because if it's not like a if
[84:19] it's not like a timestamp like you use
[84:21] like a timestamp business model where
[84:23] you're using Bitcoin to track and time
[84:25] stamp things and you have to pay to
[84:26] store that data and then someone's
[84:28] willing to pay you more than the cost to
[84:30] store the data, right? So it's like, oh,
[84:32] I want to time stamp this. Oh well, you
[84:33] know, it cost $100 to store that data.
[84:35] No problem. I'll pay you $200. I want
[84:37] this data on the blockchain. It becomes
[84:39] economical. It becomes sustainable. And
[84:41] the argument is is that that data
[84:43] storage is not going to be economical.
[84:45] It's not going to be sustainable. But I
[84:48] think that argument is only correct when
[84:50] you're at the top of the S-curve because
[84:53] right now we still have cantillionaires
[84:56] and the cantillionaires have the power
[84:57] of the printer. So they can bloat the
[85:01] UTXO and require nodes to have larger
[85:06] technical specifications to store this
[85:08] data, thus harming decentralization and
[85:13] and making it more centralized by
[85:15] blocking more people out of running a
[85:17] node in a cheap and easy way. And they
[85:20] have the incentive to do it. So when
[85:23] they spend that money to store the data,
[85:26] like if you have a bad actor who can
[85:28] print money and they spend money to
[85:30] store the data, they don't need a return
[85:32] on investment. The return on investment
[85:34] is that you're slowing down Bitcoin
[85:36] because the faster Bitcoin takes over,
[85:38] the faster you lose your ability to
[85:40] print money. So their incentive is to
[85:42] slow down Bitcoin, to make Bitcoin
[85:44] stumble, to make Bitcoin less
[85:46] decentralized, to bloat the UTXO set, to
[85:49] do anything they can to attack Bitcoin.
[85:51] So in my opinion, removing op return
[85:54] data limits is an attack vector on
[85:56] Bitcoin at this time. I think in the
[85:58] long term at the top of the S-curve, it
[86:00] is no longer an attack vector and the
[86:03] natural laws of economic incentives will
[86:06] protect that storage and protect that
[86:08] through the cost of the storage versus
[86:10] the economic return on that cost. But
[86:12] right now, as we're moving through the
[86:15] evolution of Bitcoin from digital gold
[86:17] to pristine collateral, the money
[86:19] changers, those who have a monopoly on
[86:22] the financial system are absolutely
[86:25] incentivized to attack Bitcoin at in any
[86:28] way they can at any cost because it cost
[86:31] them nothing to print money. And even if
[86:33] they print a lot of money and they lose,
[86:35] they just go crying to the government
[86:36] and say, "If you don't give us the
[86:38] money, everybody's going to lose their
[86:39] money." So they print the money and give
[86:40] it so that everybody doesn't lose. So
[86:41] they have they have access to unlimited
[86:43] funds to attack Bitcoin. There doesn't
[86:45] need to be economic incentive for the
[86:48] cost that they're paying to blow UTXO.
[86:50] So we should make no changes to Bitcoin.
[86:52] It should stay as it is. If they want to
[86:54] take advantage, take away take advantage
[86:56] through uh SegWit and Tap Routt, right?
[86:58] Don't don't make additional changes.
[87:01] Wait to make these changes until we're
[87:02] at the top of the Scurve where it starts
[87:05] to make sense. any change that be made
[87:07] right now, especially for for reasons
[87:09] based on economic incentive to me don't
[87:12] make sense because those economic
[87:13] incentives do not protect the the space
[87:16] because the the people who are trying to
[87:18] attack Bitcoin, they can print money and
[87:20] they don't need a return on investment.
[87:22] They don't need to get their cost
[87:24] subsidized by selling a service. They
[87:26] want to attack Bitcoin. They want to
[87:28] slow it down so that they can maintain
[87:30] power. And if and if you ignore that, if
[87:32] you don't believe that, then I think you
[87:33] need to study a little bit more. But
[87:35] once we get through this and we and we
[87:38] integrate and we move to the top of the
[87:40] S-curve, then go ahead and remove it and
[87:42] let the natural laws of economics and
[87:44] incentives guard that space. But until
[87:48] then, don't touch
[87:49] anything. I I agree with that uh to
[87:52] 100%. And I want to add uh any change to
[87:57] Bitcoin must be really has must have a
[88:01] really good reason
[88:04] uh for that change to be there. I know
[88:07] I'm coming actually from software
[88:08] development. A small change in the
[88:10] software can bring a problem that you
[88:13] haven't even thought about before and
[88:16] can break a system. So I don't think uh
[88:19] the system will break because we we
[88:21] removed that limit. But why take the
[88:24] chance when there is for me personally
[88:28] not a good enough reason to even remove
[88:30] that limit in the first place? Uh so I
[88:33] 100% agree with you and I just wanted to
[88:35] add like change on Bitcoin has to have a
[88:39] really freaking good reason uh to to do
[88:42] that. Yeah, absolutely. So that that
[88:45] would be the one. It's not really
[88:46] technically outside of Bitcoin, but it
[88:48] is because bit I look at Bitcoin as
[88:50] money and finance, but there is that
[88:52] third wheel which is community and and
[88:55] we need to work together as a community
[88:57] and run a node and signal to the network
[89:00] how we feel about these things and be
[89:02] active in the discussions and be sure
[89:04] that you're open to both sides, right?
[89:06] Nobody should be being blocked from
[89:07] being able to say something. That's
[89:09] ridiculous and there needs to be open
[89:11] discussion on these things. And then if
[89:13] you're going to site economic
[89:15] incentives, those economic incentives
[89:17] should be well thought out and
[89:19] understood where we are now in the
[89:21] emergence of this digital asset class
[89:23] that we know as Bitcoin versus where
[89:26] it's going to be in the long run where
[89:28] some of the economic arguments they're
[89:29] making. You know, if you're going to put
[89:31] a picture of a or if you're just going
[89:33] to store arbitrary data on Bitcoin, if
[89:35] you're not getting a price for that
[89:37] above your cost, then it's going to just
[89:39] disappear, right? I mean when when um
[89:42] when the BRC20 tokens went went crazy,
[89:45] miners were making bank. There was like
[89:47] a day or two where minor where the fees
[89:50] were more than the block reward. But if
[89:52] you look at the blockchain right now,
[89:53] it's all gone. Why? Because there was no
[89:55] economic incentive. But if you remove
[89:58] the data limit on OP return and you can
[90:01] do unlimited data, they're going to
[90:03] bloat UTXO and it's going to be an
[90:04] attack vector on Bitcoin. the economic
[90:06] incentives are invalid when you're
[90:09] fighting the money changers. Only after
[90:11] full adoption can we can we do can we
[90:14] even think about doing something like
[90:15] that. But that human element, it's funny
[90:17] because we always say Bitcoin removes
[90:19] the human element. It it doesn't fully
[90:22] remove the human element, right? Because
[90:24] one thing I've learned is that community
[90:26] and running a node and and participation
[90:29] in discussions are a key part of Bitcoin
[90:33] and we should all be participating. Even
[90:35] if you're just now learning, there's
[90:37] nothing wrong with asking a question and
[90:40] diving into these conversations to make
[90:42] sure that you understand the discussions
[90:44] that are happening around Bitcoin at the
[90:46] protocol level because it's not just the
[90:49] long-term thesis of Bitcoin that is
[90:51] important. it and the and the existing
[90:53] narratives around Bitcoin that it's
[90:55] important, but also the protocol
[90:57] discussions and the maintainers of
[90:59] Bitcoin who push these changes to core
[91:02] code and and that affects the rest of
[91:04] us. So, we should be paying attention to
[91:05] those things and understand that Bitcoin
[91:07] is not as much of a set it and forget it
[91:10] as we might want it to be. Humans love
[91:13] just buy it and forget about it. Yeah,
[91:14] but you should buy it, then you should
[91:16] spin up a node and then you should
[91:18] project your opinion into the internet
[91:19] economy with your node. uh and and
[91:22] that's going to lead to a stronger
[91:24] ecosystem.
[91:26] I 100% agree. I love that a lot. Um we
[91:29] have an end in the podcast as you know
[91:31] where the previous guest is asking a
[91:33] question for the next guest without
[91:34] knowing who the next guest actually is
[91:36] and the previous guest asks you an an
[91:38] interesting um uh question. What is the
[91:40] biggest goal uh you see yourself
[91:44] accomplishing in the next 10 years?
[91:46] Well, as somebody who's been
[91:48] accumulating Bitcoin for a long time, I
[91:52] think that my biggest goal will actually
[91:54] be life. Life itself. So, thankfully,
[91:58] right now, my wife is pregnant. We're
[92:01] expecting our fourth child. Uh, it's a
[92:03] boy. We're going to name Luke Paul. Uh,
[92:05] so we're very excited to to welcome him
[92:08] into the world later this summer. And I
[92:10] think the best thing that anybody can do
[92:12] right now um
[92:15] is if you're if you're a man, find a
[92:17] wife. If you're a woman, find a husband
[92:19] and then start start making your family.
[92:21] I mean, this is this is what life is all
[92:24] about. There's no amount of Bitcoin that
[92:26] can buy life. There is nothing you can
[92:29] do that can create life. You must find
[92:34] your soulmate. You must find your
[92:36] husband or your wife. And then when you
[92:38] come together and you create life with
[92:40] that person and then you watch that life
[92:42] grow in front of your
[92:44] eyes, it's an indescribable feeling. And
[92:47] no amount of anything can create life.
[92:50] We cannot, we don't have the power of
[92:52] the breath of life. So be appreciative
[92:54] of the breath of life. And the best
[92:57] thing I could do is bring as much life
[92:59] into the world as possible. We do. You
[93:01] know, Elon Musk is one of the very few
[93:04] people in the world who who talks about
[93:05] the fact that we have a depopulation
[93:07] problem. The the mainstream narrative
[93:10] that what the elite have brainwashed
[93:12] people to think about and understand is
[93:15] we have too many people on this planet.
[93:16] There's too many people and we're
[93:17] running out of room. No. Actually, if
[93:19] you go look at the Georgia Guidestones,
[93:21] the goals of the elite is to reduce
[93:23] population down to 500 million people.
[93:25] That's genocide. That's wickedness.
[93:28] These people hate life. They want to
[93:29] destroy it. We should we should create a
[93:32] an environment in our life and in our
[93:35] circles that respects life and values
[93:38] life above everything. And the best goal
[93:41] that not only myself but that anybody
[93:43] can do is to produce a life and to raise
[93:46] that life up to make the world a better
[93:48] place. Congrats man. Four is an amazing
[93:52] number. I love that. Do do you have like
[93:54] I are you aiming for for for a specific
[93:57] number? No, no specific number. Just
[94:00] kind of uh going with the flow.
[94:04] More, more, more. You know, people Yeah.
[94:07] I need more Bitcoin. I never have enough
[94:08] Bitcoin. I need more kids. I don't have
[94:10] enough kids. You I mean, this person,
[94:12] they they're own person. The way they
[94:14] smile, the way they laugh, the way they
[94:17] argue, the way they yell, the way they
[94:18] think.
[94:20] There's nothing more interesting to
[94:22] watch than than a life that you have
[94:24] played a role in producing grow up and
[94:27] change and mature and and and I think
[94:30] once people actually, you know, I think
[94:32] the biggest blocker I talk a lot a lot
[94:33] to a lot of my peers don't have any
[94:35] kids. They're not married and they don't
[94:36] have any kids. And you know, I'm in my
[94:38] I'm in my mid-30s. I'm 34 now. and and
[94:41] and a lot of my friends, they didn't get
[94:43] married and they don't have kids and
[94:44] they're still going out to Vegas to
[94:46] party and uh going over to Indonesia to
[94:49] to go surfing. And it's like it's all
[94:51] about you. You you you and you think
[94:54] you're going to be happy when you do
[94:55] what you want to do. But when you have
[94:57] another life, when you have a child, it
[95:01] produces a happiness in you that surfing
[95:04] the gnarliest wave and getting the
[95:06] longest barrel of your life is nothing
[95:09] compared to having your kid run up and
[95:11] give you your you give you a hug. U
[95:13] being able to go home and just talk with
[95:16] your wife who or your husband who's your
[95:19] significant other and know that that
[95:20] person cares about you and wants to hear
[95:22] what you have to say. There's nothing
[95:24] that can there's no experience that can
[95:26] deliver the euphoria that comes with
[95:30] having a family. So my my my thing would
[95:33] be create as much life as you can. We
[95:36] need it. We're going the wrong
[95:37] direction. We've been brainwashed to
[95:40] depopulate and we need to get rid of
[95:42] that mindset and rebrainwash to populate
[95:46] so that we can get as much Bitcoin
[95:48] babies as we can. It's it's a beautiful
[95:52] I cannot think of a better way and a
[95:54] more beautiful way to to end this
[95:56] podcast. We
[95:58] almost exact the same time that we also
