[00:00] how great would it be if the government
[00:02] went on a Bitcoin standard right then
[00:05] you could hold every politician and
[00:06] every bureaucrat accountable how would
[00:08] they hide the money with everybody
[00:10] looking at The Ledger why would I want
[00:12] one big centralized company to take on a
[00:15] huge position as far as the price goes
[00:18] that's taking on you know a lot of risk
[00:20] I would think as a bitcoiner you don't
[00:22] want that risk the reason you're in
[00:23] Bitcoin is because the only risk you
[00:25] want is math if if centralized entities
[00:28] custody everything then if just a
[00:30] transparent Ledger um you get the
[00:32] transparency of of knowing where your
[00:35] money is but you don't have the the
[00:37] ability to do anything with it if if
[00:39] push comes to shove right real estate
[00:41] tax income tax you know death tax just
[00:45] give me you know build it into one thing
[00:47] you know build it into the price of
[00:49] everything and let the retailers extract
[00:51] the tax then and pay it to the
[00:52] government make it easy this is what
[00:54] we're doing we're we're trying to seed a
[00:56] unit of account everybody can trust
[01:04] are you uh satisfied with with the the
[01:07] way Bitcoin has been in the last couple
[01:09] of years I think since the podcast is
[01:11] always almost been six years since you
[01:13] done your first
[01:15] podcast oh extremely satisfied with
[01:20] Bitcoin the protocol the
[01:22] technology and you know the the slow
[01:25] progress It's Made um I'm very satisfied
[01:30] extremely satisfied extremely satisfied
[01:32] with the price just the narrative you
[01:34] know the the narrative when things are
[01:37] going up is just stupid it it makes you
[01:40] think you know it it just makes you
[01:42] think like why are people here in the
[01:44] first place
[01:46] right I mean number go up is great but
[01:50] number can only go up if enough people
[01:52] have the the fortitude to take custody
[01:57] of their wealth and are willing to take
[01:59] that risk that it's super interesting
[02:01] also because like obviously the price
[02:04] had an amazing uh rout the past five
[02:07] years it's almost like a 10 a 10x from
[02:10] here uh depending on where exactly you
[02:13] you you pointed uh but uh the how did
[02:17] the pro like what are some of the
[02:20] changes that happened to the protocol I
[02:22] mean there have been some some some
[02:24] small upgrades uh it was after the Blas
[02:28] Wars that we just talked about
[02:30] uh so it it it's been uh less of less of
[02:35] controversy around that but there still
[02:38] have have been some some uh upgrades and
[02:41] some some developments in there what was
[02:44] something interesting for you there well
[02:46] I think Lightning's come a long way not
[02:48] that I necessarily use lightning for
[02:50] anything um that I needed in my
[02:54] day-to-day life but the times that I do
[02:57] use it it works all the time now um it
[03:00] seems like there's a lot of money
[03:01] invested in it and um so I think that's
[03:04] good um the the multisig companies out
[03:08] there are a lot more there's a lot more
[03:10] of them there's there's different types
[03:12] of custody you know there's
[03:14] collaborative custody there's there's
[03:17] different solutions for different people
[03:20] so I'm really pleased in that I mean as
[03:23] far as the technology goes I don't think
[03:25] Bitcoin has to do much more than it's
[03:27] doing right now just accounting for
[03:30] satoshis right that's really all it
[03:32] needs to
[03:34] do you could build everything around
[03:36] that yeah it's more about the building
[03:38] the ecosystem and building the the
[03:40] second layers and the whole ecosystem
[03:42] around it the base protocol is uh Pro
[03:46] probably almost perfect and needs only
[03:48] small like Buck fixes and maybe some
[03:50] smaller upgrades in the future to uh
[03:52] keep it future proof and stuff like that
[03:55] yeah but I think as far as being a
[03:56] transparent Ledger that you can trust
[04:00] and and build stuff on it's perfect um I
[04:03] don't think it needs to be any faster I
[04:05] don't think it needs to handle any more
[04:06] transactions the fact that you know the
[04:09] only time it's busy is when people are
[04:11] doing stupid [ __ ] on it as far as I'm
[04:13] concerned um so I think yeah I think
[04:17] it's going to be a slow long road
[04:19] there's going to be a lot of different
[04:22] narratives a lot of fud and it's going
[04:24] to go in different directions than any
[04:26] of us can
[04:28] preconceive um
[04:31] and uh I don't think we should encourage
[04:34] centralized authorities to take out
[04:37] leverage positions just to make the
[04:39] number go up that's the kind of thing
[04:40] that I just think um is downright stupid
[04:44] because that's anti Bitcoin you know
[04:48] bitcoin's about the individual you know
[04:50] an empowering individual what do you
[04:51] mean with centralized powers to take out
[04:53] Leverage is like micro strategy
[04:55] something like what your yeah yeah like
[04:58] perfect example strategy you know I I
[05:01] applaud them for whatever they're trying
[05:04] but
[05:05] um I don't encourage that I mean why
[05:10] would I want one big centralized company
[05:14] to take on a huge um position you know
[05:18] there's just that just as far as n you
[05:21] know as far as the price goes that's
[05:24] taking on you know a lot of risk I would
[05:26] think right it's taking on a risk that
[05:29] as a bitcoiner you don't want that risk
[05:31] that's the only the reason you're in
[05:32] Bitcoin is because the only risk you
[05:34] want is math and your ability to custody
[05:38] a certain amount of those
[05:40] units right you don't want to trust
[05:42] anything else right and I mean you got
[05:44] to trust the software and everything but
[05:47] um you know what I mean that's the
[05:50] basics and now you're introducing a big
[05:54] centralized um entity which like I said
[05:58] people can do whatever they want micro
[06:00] strategy could do whatever they want but
[06:02] for The Narrative of the bitcoiner to
[06:04] change to like some of the stupid [ __ ]
[06:07] you got to be dumb to follow some of
[06:09] these people who are on Twitter and you
[06:11] well I followed them because I like to
[06:12] hear what the hell they have to
[06:15] say but I mean to listen to them you you
[06:18] really have to think twice I mean some
[06:20] of the stuff that was said when when mic
[06:23] strategy was 500 you had to be a little
[06:27] bit skeptical of some of the people that
[06:30] were pumping up the pump trying to pump
[06:32] it up even higher you
[06:35] know so also see there a concern that
[06:38] they now almost have like half a million
[06:41] Bitcoin well yeah I mean any yeah I mean
[06:43] as far as the price I'm I would be
[06:45] concerned with the price of Bitcoin
[06:47] knowing that micro strategy has uh
[06:50] 500,000 Bitcoin yeah I think that's a
[06:52] concern for the price right cuz
[06:55] now now you you know you got one you got
[06:58] a bigger decision maker with where you
[07:01] know the I'd rather have uh 500,000
[07:04] people with one
[07:06] Bitcoin then one one entity with
[07:11] 500,000 right it's super interesting
[07:13] with Bitcoin because Bitcoin often gets
[07:16] uh attacked also from normous of like oh
[07:19] like the wealth distribution is so
[07:21] unfair like the early ogs have way more
[07:24] money or but I feel like it's probably
[07:28] just because
[07:30] Bitcoin is so transparent like it would
[07:32] be fun to see the same thing happening
[07:35] with like the US dollar and seeing the
[07:37] wallets of like things like that or like
[07:40] stock portfolios or like real estate or
[07:43] any other asset so it's interesting that
[07:45] we have that public Ledger how great
[07:48] would it be if the government went on a
[07:50] Bitcoin standard right then you could
[07:52] hold every politician and every
[07:54] bureaucrat accountable how would they
[07:55] hide the money with everybody looking at
[07:58] The Ledger
[08:00] right I I once tweeted instead of a a
[08:03] central bank digital currency what about
[08:06] a Citizens controlled digital currency
[08:09] why don't we flip the switch on them
[08:11] make them use some you know hey you want
[08:13] to work for the government that's fine
[08:15] you know you're you're a servant use
[08:17] this transparent money right that's why
[08:20] we should have a Bitcoin strategic
[08:23] Reserve to pay the employees right
[08:26] wouldn't that be great it would it would
[08:27] be fun if if all the government and can
[08:30] only have like a Bitcoin wallet and they
[08:33] have to give the address the public
[08:34] address public available so so we know
[08:37] it yes yes that would be fantastic you
[08:40] want to and and you know what it'd be
[08:42] opt in hey you want to work for the
[08:44] people these are the rules brother
[08:46] there's no more this paper money and you
[08:49] don't have control of the checkbook
[08:51] anymore and you definitely don't have
[08:53] control of the bank and you definitely
[08:55] don't have um control of the quantity of
[08:59] unit that are in circulation no more
[09:02] this is it 21 million you want to work
[09:03] for us you're getting paid in that this
[09:05] way we could see what you spend your
[09:06] money on if you don't want to go work in
[09:09] the Private Industry there's there's
[09:11] some I I cannot find it right now El and
[09:14] and Donald Trump actually uh discussed
[09:17] that uh publicly and like on Twitter it
[09:20] was a discussion already long before
[09:22] that but now it kind of reach the White
[09:24] House where there are a lot of
[09:25] politicians that have like a network of
[09:27] like a few tens of millions of Euros but
[09:31] only earn like I don't know like 200
[09:33] 300,000 per per uh per year where I'm
[09:36] like okay there they they seem to make
[09:40] somewhere else a lot of money to
[09:42] accumulate that kind of wealth if
[09:43] they're not building businesses um maybe
[09:46] they have some insider trading or like
[09:48] something else going on where especially
[09:51] as a policy maker as as someone that is
[09:53] a politician that can uh rule against or
[09:56] for policies that then influence
[09:58] companies then betting on those
[10:00] companies yeah I mean that's the that's
[10:02] the whole thing now we have
[10:05] transparency that holds people
[10:08] accountable uh you know these these
[10:11] politicians that are in right now they
[10:13] did what they did there's nothing you
[10:14] can really do about it let's get them
[10:16] the hell out of there and get and if
[10:19] people want to come you know work for
[10:21] the government in a
[10:23] transparent uh manner that's I think
[10:26] we'll get a lot better people you know I
[10:29] I think probably right now I'm you know
[10:31] just guessing I would say half the
[10:32] people in government are are in are in
[10:35] it for immoral reasons in it for
[10:38] themselves in it for the cash grab in it
[10:41] for the power not in it to serve that's
[10:44] a that's a load of [ __ ] you know
[10:45] what I mean yeah I think I think
[10:48] politicians have usually um a high high
[10:52] tendence to being they really want to be
[10:55] in power they really want to do
[10:56] something um I I don't know if the do it
[10:59] for for the money necessarily probably
[11:01] also there are a lot of them also
[11:03] especially if you see the netw and stuff
[11:05] like that they do things with that uh
[11:07] but but they they really tend towards
[11:10] like um having some sort of power and
[11:13] they don't see it as serving the people
[11:17] rather they see it as like oh I want to
[11:19] have power over people which is a flawed
[11:22] system to begin with which is a really
[11:24] bad
[11:24] incentive I mean it's a popularity
[11:27] contest once you get once you get
[11:29] elected you have to keep getting elected
[11:31] and that's and if you have the ability
[11:34] to make things easy on the People by
[11:37] printing money they're going to make
[11:39] that decision nine out of 10 times
[11:42] because it gets them
[11:44] reelected and um I think we're going to
[11:46] see more of that you know I I think they
[11:49] could talk all they want but if you do
[11:51] the if you do the math the math problem
[11:54] here in
[11:55] America is um it's pretty daunting and
[11:59] uh you know you got this I think what
[12:01] we're all going to learn is you know
[12:03] they got the smartest guys supposedly in
[12:05] the world in there with the smartest
[12:07] people underneath them auditing and
[12:09] everything and I think they're going to
[12:11] come out of this thing and they're going
[12:13] to tell us what they need to tell us
[12:15] whether it be we got to up the tax
[12:19] rates right or we gotta uh print more
[12:22] money one way or another you know they
[12:24] might say hey you know what all this
[12:26] money we saved actually they already
[12:29] floated the idea of giving like the
[12:31] citizens a dividend that's just another
[12:33] form of uh money printing right it's not
[12:35] like they really saved anything they
[12:39] just reduced the the amount of money
[12:41] they were going to spend in excess of
[12:43] tax collections in the first place you
[12:46] know that's what they're talking about
[12:48] like hey we were going to spend uh 700
[12:50] billion more than we had uh we're only
[12:53] going to spend 500 billion you know what
[12:56] let's give uh 100 billion of that
[12:58] savings
[13:00] to uh the people you know it's all
[13:03] smoking mirrors at the end of the day
[13:05] they have to print money either that or
[13:08] raise taxes
[13:11] significantly and if they raise taxes
[13:14] significantly people will just stop
[13:16] working and people won't do business
[13:19] here they'll go other places so they'll
[13:22] opt to if they want to stay in power
[13:25] they'll print
[13:26] money you know
[13:29] there have been a lot of interesting uh
[13:31] studies around uh raising taxes there's
[13:34] two things usually like there's usually
[13:36] a point uh where people don't accept the
[13:38] higher taxes um uh and it's different
[13:41] where the point is but there's something
[13:43] like laugher curve and stuff like that
[13:45] but uh the interesting thing is like
[13:47] once you read once you hire taxes above
[13:50] that one point people either move to
[13:53] other places or cheat they just like
[13:56] don't report income the the the black
[13:58] market that the black economy is is
[14:00] growing rapidly and both things you
[14:03] really don't want as a government so
[14:05] like ra anybody that's you know
[14:08] accumulated assets they'll stop
[14:10] accumulating assets and they'll live off
[14:13] of them right because I don't why earn
[14:17] for somebody else if they're going to
[14:18] take more I mean my threshold is is 50%
[14:21] if I got to give more than 50% to
[14:24] somebody else I'm not going to bother
[14:26] earning in a taxable manner I'll do you
[14:29] know I'll barter with you right that's
[14:31] what like you said they'll go black
[14:33] market they'll do other stuff but if I
[14:35] got to go earn $2 to get a dollar um I
[14:39] probably won't 50% is already high my
[14:43] point is
[14:44] lower no well I'm being realistic you
[14:46] know uh I pay
[14:49] federal and state is right there is
[14:53] 47 and that's without any of the taxes
[14:56] any real estate tax you know
[14:59] any any other tax that's just income
[15:03] it's nuts
[15:05] so yeah that's uh that's also um that
[15:09] this the system is kind of it's it's
[15:12] interesting because the income tax
[15:13] originally was introduced to um Target
[15:17] rich people but it actually targets the
[15:19] the middle class yeah as all all the
[15:22] riches hands
[15:24] down no
[15:27] doubt the I I anyways I'm I'm very much
[15:31] against taxes uh of income like why why
[15:35] not just uh tax consumption of of things
[15:40] would would make way more sense is you
[15:42] know let if they actually simplified the
[15:44] tax code you imagine how many paper
[15:46] shufflers that would
[15:49] eliminate you
[15:50] know
[15:52] crazy but yeah I agree with there th%
[15:56] tax consumption and let's be done with
[15:58] it I only have a very small company here
[16:01] with with the podcast uh uh where
[16:04] basically I provide for myself and like
[16:06] one more employee um so and it's already
[16:10] kind of getting complicated where um it
[16:14] matters how I invoice it matters where I
[16:18] I book stuff and it it matters that much
[16:21] of like are you paying uh that amount or
[16:25] that amount plus uh 30% in taxes
[16:29] so it's it's it's crazy how the
[16:33] complication of the tax law is uh making
[16:37] so many inefficiencies because you have
[16:40] a massive incentive to hire someone to
[16:43] look out for your tax code imagine how
[16:46] if it would be just very simple like oh
[16:49] you buy something and there's like a a
[16:51] sales tax and that's the only
[16:54] compensation and like it's just like 30%
[16:56] and everyone has to pay that one sales
[16:58] tax and that's the only tax there is um
[17:01] imagine how easy it would be and and
[17:05] what all the tax guys and stuff like
[17:08] that will be just eliminated well I mean
[17:11] you know what's crazy is that the
[17:12] government puts the responsibility on
[17:16] you to file your taxes and if you do it
[17:20] wrong they make it so complicated and if
[17:23] you do it wrong they they have the right
[17:25] to put you in jail I mean just tell me
[17:27] what I owe you you you know if you can't
[17:30] figure out you know what I'm doing and
[17:32] how much I extract from this this planet
[17:36] you know give me a number let's make it
[17:38] simple right it's inter because I'm in
[17:41] Austria so like there's a little bit of
[17:43] a different system it's actually Austria
[17:45] each month you work you automatically
[17:49] get your taxes uh like they are
[17:53] automatic you don't even see them the
[17:55] company actually pays if you're an
[17:57] employee at a company the company pays
[17:59] the income tax for you and you only get
[18:02] what's left over so in the end of the we
[18:05] do it on a weekly or bi-weekly basis not
[18:07] too many people get paid by the month oh
[18:09] you get a weekly and bi-weekly oh like
[18:10] we it's common like in Austria everyone
[18:13] gets paid by the month Yeah well yeah
[18:16] it's one week you most people get paid
[18:18] weekly here but some people get paid
[18:20] every other week we live hand in mouth
[18:23] [Laughter]
[18:26] here interesting I I heard about
[18:29] bi-weekly but like no like I think it's
[18:32] it's I never heard about anyone getting
[18:35] paid other than every month I think
[18:37] that's that's the the common in Austria
[18:39] but the the point I was making like you
[18:42] um as an employee you lost your
[18:46] purchasing power right here and there so
[18:49] you have to basically pay directly your
[18:53] taxes and then at the end of the year
[18:56] you can file your taxes and say like oh
[18:58] like I had this expens of this things uh
[19:00] or like there was some inefficiencies
[19:02] and then you get some money back right
[19:04] or have to pay more money or have to pay
[19:06] more money and more money usually not so
[19:10] like no like what if you what if you had
[19:14] a big capital gain on your Bitcoin you
[19:16] have to you have to pay taxes on capital
[19:19] gains uh yes uh that that's actually not
[19:23] AUST also that the exchanges directly
[19:26] extract
[19:27] that the what but what if how does the
[19:30] exchange know your cost your your um
[19:33] cost basis uh that's why uh there's a
[19:36] there lot of interesting things now
[19:38] happening in Austria with Bitcoin um
[19:41] there are some exchanges that are now
[19:44] only allowing you to sell Bitcoin
[19:47] Bitcoin held on their exchanges uh which
[19:50] is really bad um so if you have Bitcoin
[19:54] from outside and you put it on their
[19:56] exchanges you cannot put them on the
[19:58] changes like you cannot sell them
[20:00] because they don't know where how you
[20:02] bought them and so they cannot extract
[20:04] the capital gains tax from that and uh
[20:06] there's an old law in Austria also where
[20:09] if you bought your Bitcoin before like
[20:10] February 2021 it's all taxfree so like
[20:14] if you bought them before you you you
[20:15] don't have to pay any taxes on that
[20:18] which is really cool because it's
[20:19] actually the majority of my stack is is
[20:21] is from there um so uh that's good but
[20:26] uh the the the Austrian Austrian
[20:29] socialist ways um the the the consumer
[20:34] or the one that is buying Bitcoin cannot
[20:36] do anything wrong um uh and uh the
[20:40] exchanges have all the
[20:42] responsibility um but you can still sell
[20:44] Bitcoin like there there are services
[20:46] available in all of Europe and also in
[20:49] America where you can just um uh pay a
[20:53] Bitcoin invoice and then they transfer
[20:56] you money to an an an euro account so
[20:58] you can and pay your um rent in Bitcoin
[21:02] and then this you have to file yourself
[21:04] so then you can then you can actually uh
[21:07] have to pay later more but like outside
[21:11] of that uh situation you usually only
[21:14] get money back uh for because all the
[21:17] centralized entities are extracting the
[21:19] tax before you see the your pre you know
[21:23] your um principal and that's why I think
[21:26] we have a higher tax rate in Austria
[21:28] because people don't see the the amount
[21:32] of of money they they are paying to the
[21:34] government it's a overall negative thing
[21:37] if people like I like it more if you
[21:41] actually have to pay your taxes like as
[21:43] a as a company or like self-employed you
[21:46] actually have to pay your taxes yourself
[21:48] yourself you so you collect the money
[21:50] and then you get you have to deploy it
[21:53] which makes people way more conscious
[21:55] about uh taxes and also way more like
[21:58] hey hey like you're paying you're
[22:00] getting too much tax money from me so I
[22:03] I like the self- reliable way more than
[22:08] uh government is directly extracting
[22:10] your taxes and uh you don't even see the
[22:13] money
[22:14] ever yeah I I would just like one way to
[22:17] tax me you know why does there have to
[22:19] why do you have to get me from every
[22:21] single end you know gas tax uh real
[22:25] estate tax income tax you know death tax
[22:28] tax just give me you know build it into
[22:31] one thing you know build it into the
[22:33] price of everything and let the
[22:35] retailers extract the tax then and pay
[22:37] it to the government make it easy
[22:40] absolutely um how do you think Bitcoin
[22:43] will influence the tax system how what
[22:46] is the impact of Bitcoin on on taxes
[22:48] long term if we actually have come to
[22:49] the Bitcoin standard um well two two
[22:53] parts number one I think if they really
[22:56] wanted to encourage Bitcoin as you know
[22:59] in America they would make transactions
[23:02] under a certain limit taxfree and then I
[23:05] think you'd see um a lot of people using
[23:09] it um but as far as long-term taxes I I
[23:15] think it's I think it's a good vehicle I
[23:17] guess to collect taxes because the
[23:21] government can you know especially like
[23:23] uh in the US now they just changed the
[23:26] tax law and they're actually giving you
[23:29] the ability to change the way you
[23:32] account for your gains so if you were
[23:35] using you know first in first out uh for
[23:38] all these years and you said hey you
[23:40] know what I want to change in I want to
[23:42] change to last
[23:44] in uh now first out meaning you're going
[23:47] to pay so if if you paid you know if you
[23:49] paid $10,000 for a Bitcoin that was the
[23:52] ones you were selling you know you were
[23:54] paying the gain but now you can say hey
[23:56] the ones I were just just was buying it
[23:58] at 100,000 that's the one I'm I'm
[24:00] selling so that so they're doing that I
[24:03] guess to to get everybody uh you know
[24:07] out in in the open you know uh declaring
[24:11] how much they have in each wallet you
[24:13] know if they want to take advantage of
[24:15] that new accounting rule so I think
[24:17] you're going to see a lot of people um
[24:19] you know I think they call it safe
[24:21] harbor declare Safe Harbor and you know
[24:26] declare where all their current where
[24:27] all their coins are what their cost
[24:29] basis is on each of them so I think it's
[24:32] going you know it's an easy vehicle to
[24:35] tax for the
[24:36] government right if they choose to yeah
[24:39] it's it's interest what do you think is
[24:41] the impact overall on on the politicians
[24:45] and the government systems when when we
[24:47] have more more Bitcoin coming in in the
[24:49] system what is the impact on
[24:52] them well I I I would hope like I said I
[24:56] would hope that they go on a Bitcoin
[24:57] standard too and we pay them and then
[25:00] you know we can there would be less
[25:02] Fraud and Abuse in the system because
[25:04] everything would be on a public Ledger
[25:06] that the whole world would see but I
[25:08] mean I'm dreaming you know what I mean
[25:09] this is way out there and um but you
[25:13] know it's a radical thought yeah it's
[25:16] it's interesting also because did you
[25:19] did you see did you kind of suspect that
[25:23] we are coming so far and so fast also to
[25:27] government already talking about Bitcoin
[25:30] in like yeah
[25:32] 2025 after well just like 16 years of
[25:35] existence of that young technology
[25:38] Bitcoin no I'm not surprised
[25:41] um no I'm not surprised I think there's
[25:43] been a big effort to bring politicians
[25:46] into the into
[25:48] the conversation and politicians want to
[25:52] get elected so they need supporters so
[25:55] they're you know chameleons they'll go
[25:58] along with you know whoever's got the
[26:01] money right they'll they'll go along
[26:03] with whatever you want whatever you want
[26:05] to hear they'll tell you so of I'm not
[26:08] surprised at all so if you go out
[26:10] looking for
[26:12] politicians to join your cause they will
[26:16] if you have
[26:19] money it will be interesting a world
[26:21] where then the the the people that have
[26:24] money are bitcoiners and not like uh M
[26:30] go yeah but it's it's yeah I agree it's
[26:33] hopefully hopefully they'll have better
[26:36] incentives
[26:37] but you know you know would be
[26:41] interesting to see um if if the world is
[26:44] so different you said in the before we
[26:46] even started that that you have a
[26:47] concern uh or like you you said like you
[26:50] you want to get Bitcoin Back to Basics
[26:54] uh and and why it's the the the best
[26:56] asset of all other assets what did you
[26:59] mean by by that um like people taking
[27:04] part in the technology not the money go
[27:07] up part because it's the technology that
[27:10] you're able to self- custody your wealth
[27:13] you're actually I got two bit axes
[27:15] sitting on my desk right now they're
[27:17] mining with a
[27:19] node right between them that's that's
[27:23] amazing you know just think about that
[27:26] that's amazing I'm actually taking
[27:28] electricity out of my outlet and I'm
[27:31] making Bitcoin that nobody knows about
[27:33] and I have a device between
[27:35] them that keeps track of my
[27:39] Bitcoin and nobody knows about it that's
[27:41] the ultimate uh private money that that
[27:44] that we need like Bitcoin mining it's
[27:46] it's it's it's one aspect of Bitcoin
[27:48] mining which is really attractive for a
[27:49] lot of people you get truly non KC
[27:53] Bitcoin yeah I mean that that's but but
[27:55] I mean yeah that's awesome and I'm
[27:56] getting you know what I'm mining with
[27:59] these two machines probably about 10
[28:00] cents a day a Bitcoin but um it's the
[28:04] fact that guys got together and design
[28:07] these things it's
[28:09] amazing you know you could plug it into
[28:12] a regular outlet and actually be part of
[28:13] the network and um these things are I
[28:17] hopefully are still selling like
[28:19] hotcakes they were they were hard to get
[28:21] for a while now you can anybody can get
[28:23] them they're like 165 bucks 170 bucks
[28:27] you plug it in you connect it to your
[28:29] Wi-Fi you don't even know it's there and
[28:31] you know you're part of the network
[28:33] you're not a huge part of the network
[28:34] you're a nothing you know you're a grain
[28:36] of sand but I mean just think about it
[28:40] that's the kind of um part of Bitcoin
[28:43] like the narrative that I like
[28:46] interesting yeah how easy are I actually
[28:49] I have to get to to to set up a bit X I
[28:52] think it's it's it's long overdue it's
[28:54] click click if you have a cell phone you
[28:57] just turn on your Wi-Fi it sees it you
[29:00] get on its Wi-Fi you put in your Wi-Fi
[29:02] credentials you uh you open up a a
[29:05] mining account if you do it with uh
[29:08] Ocean or brains you can collect SATs or
[29:12] you can solo mine like a lottery in
[29:16] hopes that you know you'll hit you'll
[29:17] hit a block which you know it's not I
[29:20] have one doing that and I have one
[29:22] mining to a to to a pool just to get the
[29:25] SATs but um it's great I mean it's the
[29:29] fact that you can do it and you don't
[29:30] need you know when I first got in that
[29:33] was one of the things that really amazed
[29:34] me was the mining aspect of it that I
[29:37] could turn electricity into into money
[29:40] without anybody knowing about it um and
[29:43] I was at the time I was lo you know
[29:46] Bitcoin was like $4,000 $5,000 and it
[29:50] was costing me like $18,000 of Bitcoin
[29:54] but I did it you know what I mean cuz I
[29:56] was just like on a rush doing it and I
[29:59] knew I was but you know in retrospect
[30:00] you know it was 18 I was I was mining
[30:02] $18,000 I could have got more Bitcoin if
[30:04] I went and just took that money that I
[30:06] spent Mining and bought Bitcoin direct
[30:09] but I did both I wanted to I wanted to
[30:11] you know understand how the whole system
[30:13] worked before I actually invested any
[30:16] other money into Bitcoin I wanted to to
[30:19] earn it myself and see how you earn it
[30:21] and see how the whole system works at
[30:23] least from a broad view like I'm no
[30:25] genius
[30:28] no no you know com no computer Juniors
[30:32] for at all I just follow along you know
[30:36] um but I'm smart enough to F to be able
[30:38] to follow along instructions and get
[30:40] stuff done um and I was just amazed by
[30:42] the technology and you know self custody
[30:46] is daunting but even like I said even
[30:49] now they have Solutions with you know
[30:52] collaborative custody and multisig where
[30:55] it's you know you feel you can go to
[30:57] sleep at night no matter how much
[30:58] Bitcoin you have I partnered up with
[31:01] coin vigilante this is the most
[31:04] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:07] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:09] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:12] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[31:15] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:18] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:21] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[31:25] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[31:27] new new and amazing Genesis edition of
[31:30] their watch collections you have the
[31:33] date of the first ever mined Bitcoin
[31:36] Block in there and of course also the
[31:38] block height and which Epoch we are
[31:41] currently in I love the level of detail
[31:44] they put in in this masterpiece and make
[31:47] sure to check out those amazing coin
[31:50] vigilante time pieces down in the
[31:52] descriptions I love those watches so so
[31:56] much if you watch or listen to my
[31:58] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[32:00] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[32:03] most important step is to keep the
[32:06] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[32:08] wallet my personal recommendation for
[32:10] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[32:13] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[32:15] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[32:18] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[32:20] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[32:24] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss SL
[32:28] Robin to get your bitbox and the next
[32:31] step is to really level up your
[32:33] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[32:35] have the most secure self- custody setup
[32:38] you have to secure your own devices you
[32:41] have to protect your privacy you have to
[32:44] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[32:47] on where you live you even want to have
[32:49] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[32:52] move in case something goes really
[32:54] really wrong and through all those steps
[32:56] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[32:58] step by step and if you visit the
[33:01] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[33:05] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[33:08] out how you can level up your
[33:10] sovereignty the the Cy aspect is really
[33:13] interesting because you you feel like do
[33:15] do you really come to the do we really
[33:18] come to the conclusion where everyone
[33:19] has self- custody or like at least a a
[33:22] good amount of of people have self
[33:24] custody I sometimes wonder about that if
[33:26] we actually come to come to the
[33:29] conclusion of like oh like most people
[33:30] have self- custody or if it's more like
[33:34] uh it's it's a niche thing where maybe 5
[33:36] 10 15% of the population will be in
[33:39] self- custody and the rest just goes
[33:41] with exchanges and and and and all all
[33:44] the rest of the things yeah there we you
[33:46] got to hope that enough people I mean we
[33:48] need enough people to want to take
[33:51] custody whether it be you know single
[33:53] Sig self- custody or multi- custody or
[33:57] multisig collaborative custody or and
[33:59] when I say custody just your ability to
[34:02] move that Bitcoin whenever it is you
[34:04] might have somebody helping you or you
[34:06] know somebody has a backup and I think
[34:08] that's going to be the solution for most
[34:09] people is like a collaborative custody
[34:12] solution where they have two of three
[34:14] and they always have uh somebody in the
[34:17] in the background to help them if they
[34:18] need it um as far as custody Solutions
[34:23] right um that you have control of and I
[34:27] and we need enough people to do that you
[34:30] know is is Bitcoin failed if if uh if
[34:32] self custody is too Niche no it doesn't
[34:36] I don't think it failed but you you
[34:38] still need enough people that that can
[34:40] that want to take custody of
[34:43] it you need a critical mass of people
[34:45] who want to take custody of it in
[34:47] somebody else's hands in somebody else's
[34:49] if if if if centralized entities custody
[34:52] everything then it's just a transparent
[34:55] Ledger um you get the transparent y of
[34:58] of knowing where your money is but you
[35:00] don't have the the ability to uh to to
[35:05] do anything with it if if push comes to
[35:07] shove right yeah like you you only have
[35:10] um uh you you might get exposure to a
[35:14] good store of value uh I say might
[35:16] because you don't control it it's only
[35:19] good it's only a good store of value if
[35:20] a critical mass of people are willing to
[35:22] self- custody it right it's an
[35:24] interesting point yeah um I want to uh
[35:27] talk a little bit I mean we talked about
[35:29] the politicians and stuff like that but
[35:30] way more interesting for me is the the
[35:33] central bank system uh and and the root
[35:37] of all evil uh how do you think this
[35:41] will develop in in the coming years and
[35:43] decades uh with an exit wealth being
[35:47] there with Bitcoin people can actually
[35:49] opt out of of that Fiat system I
[35:52] personally opt it out almost entirely uh
[35:56] I only use it if I really have to um so
[36:00] it's like if more and more people find
[36:02] that and more and more people change to
[36:04] that system uh the trust lost in in the
[36:09] Fiat system in the dollar and the Euro
[36:11] and the Yen and all all the rest of
[36:12] things could go down really quickly um
[36:16] do you think that that that we that that
[36:19] we might be able to actually see the
[36:22] downfall of feat for for for real that's
[36:25] that's what we've been doing
[36:28] you're you know that's the whole point
[36:31] right we you you we're like in the I
[36:34] don't know second or third inning of
[36:36] this I
[36:37] mean this is what we're doing we're
[36:40] we're trying to seed a unit of account
[36:43] that everybody can everybody can trust
[36:46] and we're getting there slowly but
[36:48] surely you know it's going to be very
[36:50] volatile but that's what we're doing um
[36:53] we you know us bitcoiners know that the
[36:56] Fiat system is numbered you know their
[36:58] days are numbered it's it doesn't work
[37:00] forever it can work for a short amount
[37:03] of time but it's flawed by human
[37:07] intervention and humans always think
[37:09] they know better and history shows that
[37:13] they can never manage these complex
[37:16] systems like economies and monetary
[37:20] systems and uh it always you know it's
[37:23] it always inevitably failed so that I
[37:25] mean that's what we're doing right now
[37:26] is we're seeding the
[37:28] system um that hopefully mankind can
[37:32] trust in the future and will'll have a
[37:34] unit of
[37:35] account um that they can't screw
[37:39] with um right now you know everybody
[37:42] is everybody I know is keeping scoring
[37:46] dollars right and it it's the stup when
[37:49] you think when you mention to them that
[37:51] hey you're keeping scoring something
[37:53] that somebody else is has control of the
[37:57] Quant
[37:58] I was like I I read that like 80% of the
[38:01] money was produced in the last 5 years
[38:03] so I mean unless you're worth uh 4X what
[38:07] you were in five five years ago in in
[38:11] those dollars you're keeping scoring you
[38:13] lost you lost value you know 95% of the
[38:17] people that I I interact with think that
[38:20] statement is crazy now I I can't tell
[38:23] you if there was 80 if 80% of the money
[38:25] was created in The Last 5 Years I read
[38:27] that on Twitter I never fact checked it
[38:29] or anything but if it is true I mean I
[38:31] think my statement is correct if you're
[38:33] not really worth Forex what you were
[38:35] worth five years ago in dollars you
[38:38] didn't really make anything you just you
[38:41] think you did and that's the
[38:43] scam that they control the unit of
[38:46] account so they they they have to I
[38:50] completely forgot that uh your Twitter
[38:52] handle is like unit of account
[38:54] Maxi that's where I want to get I love
[38:56] that he
[38:57] um uh um I see the the Bitcoin US dollar
[39:02] price as kind of a scoreboard so that's
[39:04] why I like like the scoreboard of like
[39:07] how fast we're going to to do do that uh
[39:11] future of Bitcoin as the primary unitive
[39:14] account like obviously everyone can
[39:15] switch today and I'm already trying to
[39:19] um think in Bitcoin but it's so hard
[39:21] because everything else is is uh
[39:24] nominated in Euros or dollars like one
[39:27] of those two usually uh so it it's
[39:30] really hard to think of like oh like
[39:32] what would that um purchase now be in
[39:35] satosi or like uh oh my net worth is
[39:38] dead in Bitcoin but if you count your
[39:41] net worth in bit not not in Bitcoin but
[39:43] in US dollar it's it's way like you feel
[39:47] better because in Bitcoin like oh like
[39:49] there's a little bit coming little bit
[39:51] coming and it's more organic it's it's
[39:53] probably better for your soul uh but but
[39:56] in US dollar oh like nice like see 2x
[39:59] this year what do you call it uh Trace
[40:02] mayor a long time ago I heard he said he
[40:05] kept his balance sheet in dollars gold
[40:08] and Bitcoin so at the bottom at the end
[40:10] you know he had this the value in all
[40:12] three and I started doing that about
[40:15] five years ago and when you share that
[40:18] with your financial advisor or your
[40:21] Banker oh look at them it's so funny and
[40:25] you know be honest with you um I Last 5
[40:28] Years I accumulated more Bitcoin but my
[40:30] value in bitcoin's gone way down because
[40:33] of all my other assets went down in the
[40:36] value of Bitcoin right so if anybody if
[40:40] you do that for five years you'll see
[40:42] that even though your dollar
[40:45] value goes up your gold value and your
[40:50] Bitcoin value is going to go down even
[40:52] if you're buying both of those items
[40:54] because the Fiat is just depreciating so
[40:57] fast
[40:58] so why it's not a good unit of account
[41:01] you know it's why it's not a good unit
[41:03] of account because it's it's Unlimited
[41:05] in Supply and I think we should be
[41:08] uh I see that sometimes with Bitcoin as
[41:12] that feel really good when the Bitcoin
[41:15] price is going up and feel really bad if
[41:16] the Bitcoin price goes down well I'm
[41:18] like that that it should be the other
[41:20] way around like you want to accumulate
[41:21] as many Bitcoin as you as you can so you
[41:24] should feel good like I get I think a
[41:27] this today or like maybe yesterday I
[41:29] don't know but I there's this fear and
[41:31] greed index and now like it's it's it's
[41:33] total fear in Bitcoin and I actually
[41:36] have the other way around because I'm
[41:38] I'm young like I'm now like 26 so uh I I
[41:42] really want to accumulate a lot of
[41:43] Bitcoin uh for my future generation and
[41:46] for my future life um so whenever the
[41:49] Bitcoin price goes up and I was really
[41:51] fearful when it was like 105 106k I was
[41:54] like oh [ __ ] like are we going now to
[41:56] 200,000 can not accumulate a little bit
[41:58] more and now it goes down and I get the
[42:01] greed of like oh like where where can I
[42:03] get more Euros to buy buy more Bitcoin
[42:06] okay quickly I get a new sponsor to to
[42:08] sponsor my show because I want to have
[42:10] Bitcoin like you I really get that greed
[42:13] uh once it it goes down which is super
[42:15] interesting and I think people that
[42:17] understand Bitcoin truly and maybe
[42:19] excluding those who are right before
[42:22] retirement they should actually feel
[42:24] like that when you're in their
[42:26] accumulation phas right that's the way
[42:29] you got to think you have to embrace the
[42:33] dips right because you're going to get
[42:35] the most STS for your dollar or Euro um
[42:39] but but then as you know there's you
[42:41] could see on Twitter you can you can
[42:42] kind of get a sense for the people that
[42:44] have been around for a while who aren't
[42:46] stacking anymore and uh they you know
[42:50] they or or
[42:53] 90% everything in Bitcoin and keep it
[42:56] scoring Bitcoin
[42:57] that volatility in price still is very
[43:00] very painful so the only way this thing
[43:03] you
[43:04] know works as if that volatility dampens
[43:08] and it's not going to dampen until we
[43:09] get at much higher dollar prices and
[43:12] until then it's going to take you
[43:15] know us
[43:19] retards to uh hle I mean there's no it's
[43:23] crazy I you know it really is there's no
[43:26] way that most most people could stomach
[43:30] you know what we stomach I mean just
[43:32] this last C this last week was extremely
[43:35] painful and I've done the I think I've
[43:37] done one other podcast at this at a
[43:39] similar time where it was just after a
[43:41] nice big correction and uh I got to go
[43:43] back and listen to it but um it still
[43:46] hurts right it still hurts but I bought
[43:51] pretty good
[43:52] yesterday um you know so I know to think
[43:56] I've been in the situation long enough
[43:58] to know that there's going to come a day
[44:01] in the future where I'm going to say you
[44:03] should have [ __ ] stacked harder
[44:05] man right it's it's it's super
[44:08] interesting because
[44:10] um yesterday literally was a probably
[44:13] like
[44:14] the a world buying day of Bitcoin for
[44:17] retail folks because all the exchanges
[44:19] said like the volume was as high as we
[44:22] never saw like the buying volume and uh
[44:25] in I I I have like the two Bitcoin only
[44:28] exchanges that I track on on Twitter
[44:30] that is in Europe like that's relay and
[44:32] and and 21 Bitcoin and both of them said
[44:36] uh that's like record volume I think uh
[44:39] 21 Bitcoin said three million uh volume
[44:43] on their platforms and really 4.5
[44:46] million uh so just those two small
[44:48] Platforms in in in Europe um moved 7.5
[44:53] million into Bitcoin on one day and
[44:56] that's retail folks buying the
[44:58] tip that's good to hear that is good to
[45:01] hear
[45:03] um yeah I mean you got to you you have
[45:07] to stomach it and you have to embrace
[45:10] the dips man and don't the exact same
[45:12] goes don't fomo when everybody else is
[45:14] foming in there will always be a dip
[45:17] this thing's never going to get away
[45:19] from us it's going to trade like this
[45:22] until it doesn't trade like this and at
[45:24] that point it will be the unit of
[45:26] account um but we're you know a long way
[45:31] away and uh it's going to be fun if you
[45:34] can uh if you can program your brain to
[45:38] embrace the volatility boy it's going to
[45:41] be fun but you can't you know you can't
[45:44] have any
[45:45] preconceived uh ideas of where this
[45:47] thing's going I mean we all like I have
[45:50] my wants how I'd like to see this thing
[45:52] play out I'd like to see this thing play
[45:54] out from the from the ground up from the
[45:56] individ ual up but it seems like now
[45:59] that like you know that might not happen
[46:01] you know we might have might become more
[46:04] industrialized institutionalized and but
[46:07] that's okay too I mean it is what it is
[46:09] yeah it's it's it's it's it is what it
[46:12] is but it's also sometimes sad to see
[46:14] where big companies get it and then uh
[46:18] if you're trying to explain it to
[46:20] regular folk they're like oh no it's too
[46:22] volatile and it's like like
[46:25] a that that's why why you are where you
[46:28] are like you you it's sometimes
[46:31] frustrating for me to to to get there
[46:33] like it's super I'm really gr grateful
[46:36] and glad that my my family uh got it to
[46:40] the most part but um uh when I look in
[46:44] the fur family of like distance family H
[46:47] it's like ah still so so many stupid
[46:51] opinions on bitcoin I like open your
[46:53] eyes like look at the facts for more
[46:55] than five minutes then you might get
[46:57] but you got at this point this has been
[46:59] my experience at this point bitcoin's
[47:01] been
[47:02] mainstream if you everybody in America
[47:05] pretty much heard about
[47:07] Bitcoin in 2017 by that time you've
[47:10] everybody heard about it right so like
[47:14] you either dug in and investigated it
[47:17] then when it was you know below 10,000
[47:21] there was a lot of years in there where
[47:22] we were below 10,000 and you either did
[47:24] the homework then a dug in or or you've
[47:28] just been watching it you know in your
[47:29] peripheral and saying to yourself [ __ ] I
[47:32] should have bought it I should have
[47:33] bought it I should have bought it I
[47:34] should have bought it those people will
[47:36] probably stick their head in the sand
[47:37] the rest of their lives very few people
[47:40] will will say hey I changed my mind if
[47:43] they will only use Bitcoin when it
[47:45] becomes a necessity to use it they will
[47:48] not they they will go to their they will
[47:51] go to the uh to the Grave saying I don't
[47:54] believe in it you know it's it's a half
[47:57] a million dollars a coin I never
[47:58] believed in it well you know what
[48:00] [ __ ] you should have probably
[48:01] believed in it because it could have
[48:03] made your life a lot easier but you're
[48:05] going to have you know that's going to
[48:06] be a big portion of the population
[48:10] unfortunately but yeah it's the point is
[48:12] good like if you if you if you don't
[48:14] have Bitcoin now it's kind of your fault
[48:17] like if you're an adult right now who
[48:20] has extra cash flow to spend and you
[48:22] have some Investments and you still did
[48:24] not look at at Bitcoin
[48:27] it's like it's it's your but it that's
[48:30] that's so great about Bitcoin I I don't
[48:32] know like how you came into Bitcoin
[48:33] maybe you can talk about that later but
[48:35] um I and and so many others came into
[48:39] Bitcoin um where they saw it previously
[48:42] and then they had some time where they
[48:46] were aware about Bitcoin but they
[48:49] thought they're like oh it will not work
[48:51] government will ban it it's volatile
[48:53] environment like whatever your excus is
[48:55] to not buy Bitcoin and then at some
[48:57] point they like actually opened the eyes
[48:58] and like oh that was not true like I
[49:00] have to change my mind uh and from like
[49:03] any any ple that I talked to up to like
[49:06] Mich saor they all had a face where they
[49:09] said like oh Bitcoin is bad and then
[49:11] they're like oh Bitcoin is the best
[49:13] asset ever so they all have to change
[49:15] their mind that's what's so great about
[49:16] the community where there are a lot of
[49:18] people in here that actually are able to
[49:21] change their mind and are actually able
[49:23] to uh think critical and also are open
[49:26] to new ideas which is amazing to be
[49:28] in yeah so initially I probably heard I
[49:32] heard about Bitcoin probably in like 200
[49:35] 15 16 uh didn't think much of it I think
[49:38] I had a gambling account that was closed
[49:40] and I offered to pay me in Bitcoin but I
[49:42] I didn't take it I just took the USD but
[49:45] then like in 2017 it was all over the
[49:48] news it was going through I got in at
[49:51] the very top so you it was it was
[49:54] December 31st 200 17 I was off on like
[49:59] Christmas vacation I had some time to
[50:01] think and look over things and somebody
[50:04] was willing to sit down with me and show
[50:06] me how to buy it and I started buying it
[50:09] and then I started watching stuff on
[50:10] YouTube and then I wanted to mine it and
[50:12] then I went down that whole rabbit hole
[50:15] and kept buying it kept buying it and
[50:17] was losing from day one I wasn't I
[50:20] wasn't up ever you know what I mean I
[50:23] bought every [ __ ] coin known to man uh
[50:26] watched all those videos went through
[50:28] all that mined
[50:29] shitcoins
[50:31] um and uh you know eventually found my
[50:34] way to listening to the right people in
[50:36] the space uh meeting the right people I
[50:39] went I went to a conference early on in
[50:41] San Francisco got to meet like the
[50:44] people like Adam back and BTC sessions
[50:47] and other people and just saw that that
[50:50] you know it was for real people were
[50:51] actually real people were were actually
[50:54] trying to make a currency that nobody
[50:55] could [ __ ] with
[50:57] and uh you know that's how I got into it
[51:01] and uh I didn't see a viat profit for a
[51:05] while no interesting yeah like that this
[51:10] really buil probably your conviction a
[51:12] lot because uh you were down so you so
[51:15] you had
[51:16] a yeah the best thing ever happened if I
[51:20] would have been up knowing every knowing
[51:22] my knowing how I treated everything else
[51:24] in my life up to that point
[51:27] I would have just chalked up a a taxable
[51:30] gain and bragged about it if I was up
[51:34] right um so the best thing that ever
[51:36] happened was that I you know learned
[51:39] about it during a bare market and uh got
[51:42] involved that at that point rather than
[51:45] you know making money right from Jump
[51:47] Street on it because I would have
[51:48] definitely sold and and also I think the
[51:52] if if your investment is going down uh
[51:55] you research uh more than if your
[51:58] investment is just going up yes oh th%
[52:01] th% you dig in you dig in you're like
[52:04] hey I'm either going to take a big loss
[52:06] here or I'm going to figure out what the
[52:07] [ __ ] I bought so you know I knew nothing
[52:11] at that point I I still have some some
[52:13] notes from back then when I first
[52:16] started um when I first learned about it
[52:19] from that weekend you know from that New
[52:20] Year's Eve weekend and it's funny to
[52:23] read now I was so you know so [ __ ]
[52:27] coined you know I I was you know I I had
[52:29] like a portfolio percentage of this
[52:32] shitcoin I
[52:35] coin they all went to [ __ ] that's why
[52:38] they call them [ __ ] coins I
[52:39] unfortunately don't have it anymore
[52:41] maybe I'll find it somewhere uh but I
[52:44] had in 2020 I was in stocks a lot and I
[52:49] also came across Bitcoin it was like my
[52:51] Discovery phase of Bitcoin but the first
[52:53] half of a year I did not really
[52:54] understand it I was like oh it's
[52:55] interesting just like have it as a
[52:57] diversifier of my portfolio and I made
[53:00] actually Bitcoin video uh and I I cannot
[53:02] really remember what I said but it was
[53:04] like a 20 30 minute video where I just
[53:06] talked about Bitcoin and I really want
[53:09] to find that video just to see how my
[53:14] overall feces on bitcoin changed and to
[53:17] see how my overall feces on investments
[53:19] in General changed within the last like
[53:22] now almost five years when I got it back
[53:25] back in the days so that that that it's
[53:28] really interesting to to document
[53:30] publicly because you see how dumb you
[53:35] were and I there's a couple people on
[53:38] Twitter who keep track of your old
[53:39] tweets and they they bring them back up
[53:42] and you remember how how how you were
[53:44] thinking then and you know most of the
[53:46] times I'm pretty uh uh I'm okay with
[53:50] pretty much everything I've said you
[53:53] know I don't you know regret saying
[53:55] anything I've ever said I've always been
[53:57] pretty humble come from a humble
[54:00] standpoint where like listen I'm
[54:02] learning if you know there there's a lot
[54:05] to learn so you always got to be humble
[54:07] and stack
[54:08] SATs you know and um think try to think
[54:12] from your future perspective because up
[54:16] to this point I've always everything
[54:18] I've looked back I mean I remember like
[54:20] Bitcoin correcting from all different
[54:22] price levels and every time it does it
[54:25] feels like [ __ ] this is it we're going
[54:28] to zero you were wrong every time you
[54:31] know and uh afterwards you're always you
[54:34] always have that regret like why didn't
[54:35] I stack harder like why didn't I buy at
[54:38] 177,000 why didn't I buy when it went
[54:41] back down to 58 you know why didn't I so
[54:47] and you got to you got to just keep
[54:49] stacking that's a little at a time don't
[54:52] o you know i' like to keep a cash
[54:54] reserve on the side for days like
[54:56] yesterday where you know you can kind of
[54:59] make up you can average down all your
[55:01] daily Stacks from the month before
[55:05] right um so that's been that's worked
[55:09] for me and I've been able to ride this
[55:12] is it the DCA aspect the the most
[55:14] important one that that you have learned
[55:16] in the in the past years in
[55:18] Bitcoin I knew it before Bitcoin with
[55:20] other assets so when I came into Bitcoin
[55:23] I knew that was and when I say I knew it
[55:26] it's a personal thing it's your you know
[55:29] a lot of people are better are best
[55:31] buying all at once and other people are
[55:33] best buying a little at a time whatever
[55:35] works for you and for me buying a little
[55:39] at a
[55:40] time and having that having a road map
[55:43] of doing that for say 10
[55:45] years um that helps me that help that
[55:50] helps me mentally you know ride it
[55:52] interesting um before we come to the ENT
[55:55] and the last questions of the day um uh
[55:59] I I think you're really a straight
[56:00] shoter so I'm I'm really interesting on
[56:02] what you say to that what do you think
[56:04] is your most controversial opinion in
[56:06] within Bitcoin oh boy I don't
[56:10] know um I think I said a pretty
[56:13] controversial thing before that a lot of
[56:15] bitcoiners are like what are you a
[56:16] [ __ ] idiot but I would like I would
[56:18] like our politicians to have to use
[56:20] Bitcoin that's my goal or that's that
[56:23] would be my dream it's a still a long
[56:26] way but I I hope we get
[56:28] there yeah absolutely I'm asked each and
[56:32] every one of my guests the same question
[56:34] uh at the end of the podcast and the
[56:36] question is what can we learn from you
[56:38] besides Bitcoin have fun get a hobby and
[56:42] have fun because and don't look at the
[56:44] charts that much you know I keep myself
[56:47] occupied with other [ __ ] and that has
[56:50] worked for me um because the only thing
[56:53] you Bitcoin doesn't need you you don't
[56:56] need need to advertise for Bitcoin keep
[56:58] stay safe you know like I tell my family
[57:00] members you don't have to advertise stop
[57:02] wearing anything with Bitcoin it doesn't
[57:05] need you anymore just be able to hold on
[57:08] you know figure out how to secure your
[57:10] [ __ ] make sure your loved ones can
[57:11] access it and have hobbies and live
[57:15] life and that's it um we have a it's
[57:20] amazing and then and we have an
[57:21] entertain in the podcast and then today
[57:23] is a really interesting one we have an
[57:24] entertain in the podcast where where the
[57:27] previous guest is asking a question for
[57:28] the next guest without knowing who the
[57:30] next guest is and the previous guest
[57:31] asked you you have to hold uh one thing
[57:36] for 10 years and you cannot hold
[57:38] anything else would you either hold five
[57:41] million Bitcoin in an ETF or two and a
[57:43] half million Bitcoin in Cold Storage
[57:46] number one two and a half million
[57:47] Bitcoin is more than I'll ever be able
[57:49] to [ __ ] spend right so just give it
[57:51] to me that
[57:53] way just
[57:57] that's a good one I I think we we have
[57:58] to lower
[58:01] like if you brought that number down to
[58:04] like 10 and 20 Bitcoin then it's you
[58:07] know it's a little bit more of a
[58:09] a you have to think about it a little
[58:11] bit more but yeah like maybe like five
[58:13] million bitco $5 million in Bitcoin in
[58:16] ETF or like or like um
[58:21] 100,000 dollars in in Bitcoin Cold
[58:24] Storage yeah well well the ETF can't
[58:27] doesn't do you any good unless you can
[58:28] sell it
[58:30] so that's true yeah that's true I would
[58:33] go with cold
[58:35] storage any day because like at least I
[58:38] can control it and and do what I want I
[58:41] want I want with it ETF like yeah I
[58:44] don't want to be forced into that uh
[58:46] really cool it was amazing to to have
[58:48] you on um Before I Let You Go um where
[58:51] can people find you ask your questions
[58:52] reach out to you um Twitter and N so if
[58:56] you go to my Twitter um feed at Fartface

[60:03] that or you just was like oh like I'm a
[60:05] f face yeah yeah no that was just a
[60:07] stupid thing I did that was when like I
[60:09] first heard about Twitter and social
[60:11] media uh like back uh 2 I think 8 or
[60:15] 2009 and at that time you know I didn't
[60:19] even think it would take take root you
[60:22] know I didn't think social media was a
[60:23] thing so I just was goofing around and I
[60:26] created the created a user account
[60:27] really didn't didn't use it all at all
[60:30] until 2017 oh yeah yeah I I just see you

[60:43] amazing yeah but I like I said I didn't
[60:47] use it until like until 2017 I don't
