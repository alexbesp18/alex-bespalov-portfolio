[00:00] if you found out today just at a normal
[00:02] doctor checkup it turns out you only
[00:03] have 5 to 10 years left to live what
[00:05] would you change about your life I want
[00:06] the freedom to be with who I want to be
[00:08] with and to be doing things I find Value
[00:10] in the real value of Bitcoin has to go
[00:12] up to the detriment of other assets
[00:14] people are going to retire at 36 and be
[00:16] like all right I don't have to work
[00:17] anymore they're going to go start
[00:18] backpacking in Thailand and they're
[00:19] going to get there and after 2 months
[00:20] realize like well I guess that was cool
[00:21] but I'm sort of bored now and my
[00:23] goodness I don't have anyone to share
[00:24] this with if you went to the doctor for
[00:25] a routine checkup and you found out that
[00:27] you only have 24 hours left to live
[00:29] thinking about the finality of that
[00:30] moment what did you miss I had a client
[00:32] a few weeks ago call and let me know
[00:35] that their husband passed away um he's
[00:38] he's 41 and she's 34 and they have a
[00:41] three-year-old this is a family I've
[00:43] worked with for about five years
[00:44] now and
[00:47] uh not remotely
[00:50] expected um and that night she called me
[00:53] was about 9:00 and I was working that
[00:54] night and I had to work for a few more
[00:56] hours then I went home and I just read
[00:58] my notes from our conversation for The
[01:00] Last 5 Years and
[01:02] um that is
[01:04] very in my mind like that can happen
[01:07] that's real
[01:09] [Music]
[01:14] um it's it's funny when you have a
[01:17] Bitcoin podcast but you you rarely have
[01:21] an actually licensed financial planner
[01:23] on the show like that's rarely happens I
[01:25] think like like two or three that
[01:27] actually have this CPR and CFR I don't
[01:30] know the the whole titles but uh use use
[01:33] something like that right yes uh well
[01:36] the the reason it's rare is because uh
[01:38] there's not many of us um I think I'm
[01:41] friends with basically every financial
[01:43] planner out there who uh understands and
[01:45] advocates for Bitcoin um and yeah
[01:47] there's like there's like six of us at
[01:50] least in the US um so yeah we we are the
[01:53] anomaly amazing what does it make so so
[01:56] difficult to to be a financial planner
[01:58] and in Bitcoin is it like are you
[02:00] learning a lot of fear in there um I
[02:04] would say because up until recently I
[02:07] would say now it's becoming
[02:08] more better from the from the bitcoiner
[02:11] side of things um but for the last
[02:14] several years the hard part is has been
[02:16] I've had I have regularly have Stones
[02:19] thrown at me from both camps so the uh
[02:23] the traditional Finance people think I'm
[02:25] an idiot um you know they think that
[02:27] that the fact that I own Bitcoin and
[02:28] that I advocate for our clients Stone
[02:30] Bitcoin is absolutely insane and that
[02:32] I'm I'm a total [ __ ] and wrong um so I
[02:35] get that from from that side of things
[02:36] that's one Camp I leave I live deeply in
[02:38] finance and personal finance I love that
[02:40] side but then from the Bitcoin side of
[02:43] things I also uh get Stones thrown my
[02:46] way for talking about like you should
[02:49] have a US dollar emergency fund and like
[02:52] maybe you should diversify and Maybe not
[02:54] maybe maybe it doesn't make sense for
[02:56] everyone to have 100% of allocation in
[02:58] Bitcoin and it's like oh like that guy
[03:00] that guy's a bear it's like all right so
[03:02] I I can't satisfy anybody um that I
[03:05] guess that's what what when it's hard
[03:06] and I would say that over the last few
[03:08] years let's say probably like three or
[03:10] four years ago um I took a lot more flak
[03:13] from the Bitcoin Community for being a
[03:14] financial planner um I think like last
[03:17] having cycle I felt like there was this
[03:19] this hype race it was like who can have
[03:21] the most hype and have the biggest price
[03:23] prediction who can be the biggest bull
[03:25] for Bitcoin and the the larger your
[03:27] price prediction for the having cycle
[03:29] the more respect you were in the
[03:30] community and if you said that you only
[03:32] thought that Bitcoin was going to go to
[03:33] x and some guy said it was x times two
[03:35] like suddenly you didn't like Bitcoin um
[03:38] I I'm hoping to see that reduced not
[03:40] that I don't like Bitcoin but like yeah
[03:43] it's I'm not I'm not getting as much
[03:45] criticism from the Bitcoin side maybe uh
[03:48] maybe I've just become thicker skinned
[03:49] though I don't
[03:51] know yeah it's uh it's so funny because
[03:54] I put thumbnails together and stuff like
[03:56] that so I know uh people think like I
[03:59] put the price in the in every thumbnail
[04:01] but I look at the data I'm like oh like
[04:03] I put like the Thum the price rarely in
[04:06] there like maybe like every every 10th
[04:08] or every 20th episode but the thing is
[04:10] people click on that so they see it all
[04:12] the time in their feets uh so that's
[04:15] definitely people are really uh focused
[04:18] on the on the US dollar price on that um
[04:20] I'm really curious also um when you look
[04:23] at the average Bitcoin uh you spoke with
[04:26] a lot what what can they learn uh from
[04:29] financial planning perspective what is
[04:30] the the the most the biggest uh mistake
[04:34] you think bitcoiners are making I can
[04:36] take this lots of
[04:38] directions um of course I could I could
[04:40] speak to the technical side of
[04:42] integrating Bitcoin to a financial plan
[04:43] and talk about tax planning and Estate
[04:45] Planning and like the pro the high
[04:47] probability that my guess is the average
[04:50] bitcoiner right now is like a 37y old
[04:52] male um and you know in satoshi's words
[04:55] those lost Bitcoin will be you know uh
[04:58] um uh is the words anyways they will be
[05:01] donations to other Bitcoin holders so
[05:02] those lost Bitcoin and there will be
[05:05] some the average Bitcoin again called a
[05:08] 37y old male some of those will die
[05:11] prematurely and they didn't have a plan
[05:14] and uh they their wife or spouse will
[05:16] not know how to access that so like I
[05:18] could speak to that we could speak to
[05:19] the tax planning we could talk to I lots
[05:22] of things um but the two things that
[05:24] immediately come to mind as far as what
[05:25] those are important I'd say the two most
[05:27] important things that I think are
[05:28] neglected would be
[05:31] uh uh well okay you asked for one I
[05:35] would say it is the
[05:37] alignment of your money with your family
[05:41] and what you value now okay I'm GNA
[05:43] cheat I'm I'm lumping those two together
[05:46] so one what role does Bitcoin actually
[05:48] play in your life if it's Bitcoin if
[05:50] it's US dollars if it's stocks if it's
[05:53] whatever what role does that actually
[05:54] play Bitcoin itself is not the end
[05:58] Bitcoin is money and money is a tool to
[06:01] help you do what's important to you in
[06:02] life so have you actually identified
[06:04] what it is that you value and the role
[06:06] that that has or is your in-game to
[06:08] actually just stack as much Bitcoin as
[06:09] possible maybe that is your goal I I
[06:11] don't know it seems like a a strange
[06:13] goal even if you're doing that you're
[06:15] doing it maybe for a future generation
[06:17] so your end goal is to actually impact
[06:18] your future generation not as much as
[06:20] Bitcoin as possible so anyways that's
[06:22] problem one is the lack of articulation
[06:25] of what the money is there for and then
[06:28] step two uh the second biggest issue
[06:30] that that's uh I run into all the time
[06:34] is again going back to in my experience
[06:36] the average demographic of bitcoiners is
[06:39] usually
[06:40] men um so I very regularly run into
[06:43] people reaching out hey Jim um I have
[06:46] fallen down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole over
[06:48] the last x amount of years um my wife
[06:50] hears me talk about it all the time and
[06:53] either like at best she uh she willingly
[06:58] tags along and allocates to it or she
[07:03] begrudgingly tags along uh and lets me
[07:07] buy it or she is hostile to it and it
[07:10] really is a point of contention in our
[07:12] marriage um that that is a huge thing I
[07:17] run into all the time and it's a it's
[07:19] this alignment and that's what those
[07:21] those two conversations I just mentioned
[07:22] they marry together well if you can if
[07:24] you can uh navigate them
[07:26] properly it's interesting how much uh of
[07:29] uh finances uh just playing in the head
[07:32] like mentally just like an emotional
[07:34] thing and discipline stuff like it's
[07:36] it's just like aligning of values like
[07:38] just looking in the future and and doing
[07:40] that it's it's really interesting for me
[07:42] um what do you mean with aligning money
[07:44] to your values do you mean with like
[07:46] this goal setting and and going in there
[07:49] with like like what do you really want
[07:50] to do with your money like what's your
[07:52] goal with it yes so well so money money
[07:57] is a means of communication it it how
[08:00] you use or don't use your money is a
[08:03] means of you communicating what's
[08:04] important to you so at least in the US
[08:07] money is every year the number one cause
[08:09] of divorce and the reason we see that a
[08:12] lot is well again it communicates values
[08:15] but especially if you say like hey uh
[08:18] Robin it's really important that um um I
[08:22] know that you feel secure and that we're
[08:24] able to I tell my wife hey I was going
[08:27] to use you as example but I'm not going
[08:28] to take you take you on a date so I tell
[08:30] my wife her name is Kindra kindra's
[08:31] right here behind me um uh so hey Kindra
[08:34] I really want to make sure that you and
[08:35] I go on a date night once a week um and
[08:38] I want to do these things for you but if
[08:40] I'm not using my money and my time to
[08:43] demonstrate that she is a priority to me
[08:46] there will start to be inks there my
[08:47] words can say that I value something but
[08:49] the use of my money uh can be counter to
[08:53] that and that's where you start seeing a
[08:55] lot of pull um it's like hey you said
[08:58] you said that it's important that you're
[08:59] able to spend time with your family but
[09:02] uh you spend a lot of time at work and
[09:04] trying to accumulate things so your
[09:06] lifestyle is showing that having money
[09:08] and working a lot is actually more
[09:11] important than time with your family um
[09:13] so money how you use it or don't use it
[09:16] um again communicates what's important
[09:19] to you so that is you have to recognize
[09:22] that first and that's where that's where
[09:23] money can be so contentious is people
[09:26] not
[09:27] recognizing that their money habits are
[09:31] misaligned with what they tell their
[09:34] spouse or people in their lives what
[09:36] they value or heck even acknowledging to
[09:38] themselves oh I really want to make sure
[09:40] that I'm financially secure and um would
[09:42] love to not have to work forever yet the
[09:45] way they use their money does not
[09:46] actually uh pair well with what they're
[09:49] saying there's an interesting study I I
[09:52] read about a few years ago um I don't
[09:54] know sciency stuff behind it basically
[09:56] these uh uh these guys hooked things on
[09:59] people's heads that could re your brain
[10:01] waves okay and they had them they would
[10:03] tell them stories so they would tell a
[10:05] story like Robin um this happens to you
[10:08] you're in a car wreck and you're par
[10:10] paralyzed and then they would tell a
[10:11] euphoric story Robin this happens and
[10:13] it's a great thing then they would tell
[10:14] a story about a stranger hey this
[10:16] stranger got in a car wreck and this
[10:17] thing happened and then Robin in 50
[10:20] years this thing happens to you so they
[10:22] would tell those different stories and
[10:24] read how your brain monitored or
[10:26] registered those and what they found was
[10:28] if I told a story to you about your
[10:30] present hypothetical that happens it
[10:33] would register in one part of your brain
[10:34] If I Tell Robin a story about a stranger
[10:38] it would register in a different part of
[10:39] your brain you felt bad for the person
[10:40] that got in a car wreck but it wasn't
[10:42] you and then if I told Robin a story
[10:44] about Robin and 50 years it registered
[10:46] in the stranger part side of your brain
[10:48] not you side of brain so it's really
[10:52] hard a lot of times people have a very
[10:54] difficult time recognizing that future
[10:57] them is still them
[10:59] um so again that comes back with this
[11:02] aligning of like all right is what I'm
[11:04] doing now actually aligning what I say I
[11:06] value that could be today that could be
[11:09] in 50 years um and then uh as far as the
[11:13] goal sides of things um yes that's
[11:16] obviously that's that's really important
[11:19] I would say a a risk of starting with
[11:22] goals is goals can be very arbitrary and
[11:25] goals will change so Robin if I said to
[11:27] you like hey Robin like what uh what are
[11:29] your what are your big financial goals
[11:30] that you have right now what are things
[11:31] you want to do and have that we apt to
[11:35] probably in my experience most people to
[11:38] start shouting out things that they have
[11:40] heard they're regurgitating things that
[11:42] they think should be goals well I want
[11:43] to do this this and this and I guess I
[11:45] want to retire at X and whatever and
[11:47] they're just saying them from a surface
[11:48] level or again regurgitating things that
[11:50] they've other heard people say are goals
[11:52] you should have so what's more important
[11:54] than starting with goals is starting
[11:56] with what is the underlying themee of
[11:59] what you value both individually and
[12:01] personally and then as a family um what
[12:04] what is important what what informs
[12:06] those goals and once you've articulated
[12:08] that then we can move into the goals
[12:10] associated with that value um
[12:12] recognizing that the goals themselves
[12:14] are going to change you know it's like I
[12:16] want to make sure
[12:18] that um I retire at 51 that's a goal
[12:23] well you can get to 51 and realize like
[12:24] wow actually love what I do I want to
[12:26] retire when I'm 60 now but you realize
[12:29] then that the goal wasn't retiring at 51
[12:32] the goal was not going to a job that you
[12:34] dislike starting at 51 and once you get
[12:37] there the goal posters move because
[12:39] suddenly you're not going to a job that
[12:41] you dislike at 51 you're doing it you
[12:43] reached your goal but you didn't reach
[12:44] your state of goal you reach the
[12:45] underlying value so it's an articulation
[12:47] of what is really important to me and
[12:49] then finding Associated goals and once
[12:52] we've articulated what you value what
[12:53] those goals are then assessing okay
[12:56] here's the tradeoffs and decisions and
[12:57] implications if I choose to Su X I am
[13:00] deliberately or not deliberately giving
[13:02] up on Y and recognizing that those
[13:05] tradeoffs um that's super important like
[13:07] if you're GNA put all your money into
[13:08] Bitcoin you're sacrificing something
[13:10] else if it's your wife's peace of mind
[13:13] um or if it's delaying gratification for
[13:15] a vacation you want to go on or whatever
[13:18] it is you know you are sacrificing for
[13:20] that and where does that come in those
[13:22] trade-offs and opportunity cost and once
[13:24] you've navigated those things well then
[13:26] you can finally start taking action and
[13:27] at that point the taking action is
[13:29] pretty simple because you've identified
[13:30] these other things and again most people
[13:32] unfortunately just start you know it's
[13:34] like well I don't I I can't afford to
[13:36] save because they haven't even thought
[13:39] about why they want to save they they
[13:40] are they are still thinking about future
[13:42] future them as a stranger um or it's
[13:45] like hey I have an extra thousand dollar
[13:47] a month that I can start saving and they
[13:49] just arbitrarily put it somewhere it's
[13:51] because they have identified what's
[13:52] important to me both now and down the
[13:54] line um you know a a financial plan is
[13:57] is a is telling your money here's where
[13:59] you're going to go because I want you to
[14:01] do this both now and down the line um
[14:03] and it comes it has to be intentional
[14:05] and deliberate so sorry that was a
[14:07] really long answer to or to a short
[14:10] question I love that I love that it's
[14:13] always like when when the guest runs uh
[14:16] uh that's usually the the best part of
[14:18] it um retiring is a really interesting
[14:21] um subject I know it's super super
[14:24] popular in Bitcoin I think a lot of
[14:26] bitcoiners are also looking for Bitcoin
[14:29] as a retirement means uh one thing that
[14:32] just came up in my mind when you're
[14:34] talking and and and what I have a goals
[14:37] I always had the goal of maximizing my
[14:42] um time where I don't have to work and
[14:46] still be fine like I always like
[14:48] measured my net worth of like okay how
[14:50] many months how many years could I now
[14:53] basically live uh without me having any
[14:57] income that that was uh uh previous to
[15:00] my podcast my like definition of like
[15:03] what's my net worth actually I never
[15:05] calculated in Bitcoin or in in US
[15:07] Dollars I always made this uh
[15:10] calculation of like okay how much wealth
[15:11] do I have uh what it's my running cost
[15:14] how will it developed uh what's probably
[15:17] my my months of or years that I have uh
[15:20] since I started the podcast I kind of
[15:22] fought a little bit different because
[15:24] now I actually do something that I like
[15:27] I actually do something that I really
[15:28] enjoy and I'm like I don't even if I if
[15:32] someone is like oh I will give you a
[15:34] million each each month I I would not
[15:36] stop it uh maybe I would Outsource uh
[15:40] taxes a little bit more because I don't
[15:41] like bookkeeping and taxes too much
[15:43] maybe I would Outsource some other parts
[15:45] of it but most of it actually 90%
[15:48] already like so I think like retiring
[15:50] most people just don't want that shop
[15:54] like most people just don't uh dislike
[15:56] the shop when they really want to die is
[15:59] that a is that a wrong
[16:01] assumption yeah I found
[16:04] it's typically people are not looking to
[16:09] retire per se it is I wish I had more
[16:12] time to be with the people I care about
[16:14] and be doing something that I value and
[16:17] sometime that
[16:19] means being retired but a lot of times
[16:22] that's not hey like you know for the
[16:24] longest time at least in the US there's
[16:26] like generational thing for like
[16:29] Baby Boomers I guess you work your job
[16:32] for 40 years you retire at 66 you get
[16:37] your pension and uh you go down to
[16:39] Florida a couple times a year and you
[16:40] play shuffle board you do that till
[16:41] you're 73 and then you're too tired to
[16:43] go down there anymore and then you stay
[16:44] at home and you you go eat at Golden
[16:46] Corral or some sort of buffet and then
[16:49] you die um and I people I think start
[16:51] people are starting to realize like that
[16:53] sort of stinks um I don't want to wait
[16:55] to do these things until I'm 67 and uh
[16:58] so it's not that end goal of retiring it
[17:00] is I want the freedom to be with who I
[17:03] want to be with and to be doing things
[17:06] that I I find Value in if I could do
[17:08] that working is not the issue it's those
[17:11] it's the autonomy and freedom so yeah
[17:14] you can pursue you can pursue
[17:17] retirement um but still be empty I think
[17:20] there's a lot of people who pursue fire
[17:22] you know the fire movement Financial
[17:23] Independence retire early I think a huge
[17:27] risk in these people who are pursuing
[17:29] fire at all cost a lot of these people
[17:31] are going to work a whole lot in their
[17:33] 20s and early 30s and they're going to
[17:35] stiff arm everything in their life that
[17:38] they should be inviting in and not not
[17:39] everything but like uh close
[17:41] relationships and depth and just like
[17:43] investing in things and people that
[17:46] again it come there's opportunity cost
[17:48] if you're going to work a whole bunch
[17:49] and like do all these things so you can
[17:51] retire when you're 36 that has to come
[17:53] at some end to to some cost okay so I
[17:56] think a lot of these people are going to
[17:57] retire at 36 and be like all right don't
[17:59] have to work anymore they're going to go
[18:00] start backpacking in Thailand and
[18:02] they're going to get there and after two
[18:03] months realize like well I guess that
[18:05] was cool but I'm sort of bored now and
[18:06] my goodness I don't have anyone to share
[18:08] this with like that's pretty lame um
[18:11] would you rather have retirement at 36
[18:13] but you just missed out on all these
[18:15] things or would you rather have
[18:16] fulfillment in relationships but have to
[18:17] work till you're 61 like again we're not
[18:21] looking to not have to work we're
[18:23] looking for flexibility and freedom uh
[18:26] to do what's what you value and that can
[18:28] mean I mean if if I said retirement is
[18:31] my ultimate goal and having money was my
[18:33] ultimate goal I I have four young kids
[18:35] so if if if money and all that was my
[18:37] ultimate goal I would just work 90 hours
[18:40] a week because I I I I own I own my own
[18:42] business I could just work a whole lot
[18:43] and bring on more clients but money in
[18:46] retirement is not the goal it's of
[18:49] course I want money but that way I can
[18:51] spend time with and have impactful time
[18:53] with my family and be able to be
[18:55] generous with our money so I have to
[18:58] recognize that yes money helps with
[18:59] those things but it's not the it's the
[19:01] means to an end um so if having money so
[19:04] I can spend time with my family is
[19:06] really important that means it would be
[19:08] crazy foolish of me to say my oldest son
[19:11] his name's attakus attakus just turned
[19:13] seven last week it'd be really foolish
[19:15] for me to say hey attakus um I need to
[19:17] work more we'll hang out when you're 18
[19:19] and I finally made have a net worth of
[19:21] 20 million then we can really hang out
[19:23] by the time he's 18 he's going be like
[19:24] forget you Dad where were you all my all
[19:26] my childhood it's like oh I was doing
[19:27] this so we could have a great time now
[19:29] like I just I just wasted it
[19:32] all uh it seems like uh you're almost
[19:36] more of a life coach than a financial
[19:38] planner
[19:40] then I mean that's what money uh yes
[19:44] what what we what I do is I live
[19:46] anywhere and everywhere that your life
[19:48] and your money intersect and your life
[19:50] is a means of helping
[19:52] you uh do what's the most important in
[19:55] your life in the most efficient and
[19:57] effective way that's what money helps
[19:58] you do um but if you allow money to
[20:01] become that thing uh it can accidentally
[20:03] become the a massive detractor to those
[20:07] again it can it can subvert what you're
[20:08] trying to get at I I don't I don't know
[20:11] Jeff Bezos but let's say personally you
[20:14] said hey Jim I have a crystal ball and
[20:16] in 30 years you'll be the world's
[20:18] richest person or the second richest
[20:20] person in the world but hey with that
[20:24] you're G to be divorced from your wife
[20:25] and I don't know Jeff and his kids I
[20:27] don't know if Jeff has kids let's say
[20:29] hey Jim at that though you're going to
[20:31] be divorced
[20:32] you'll uh and you won't have a good
[20:35] relationship with your kids and say ah
[20:38] no thanks I don't want it but somewhere
[20:40] along that line maybe maybe Jeff would
[20:42] have that response in 1990 if you told
[20:44] him that maybe not let's say let's give
[20:47] him the benefit doubt and say that yeah
[20:48] he would say man I'd rather have my wife
[20:50] than have zillion
[20:52] dollars he probably didn't say like okay
[20:55] I'll take it it just came over time he
[20:57] incrementally madec decision to say well
[20:59] money is more important than my wife you
[21:01] make that decision over and over again
[21:04] that's what happens um yeah and I I want
[21:07] to make sure people aren't doing that
[21:09] like I care about our clients money
[21:11] obviously but I care about them way more
[21:12] and if I care about you I'll obviously
[21:14] be I'll obviously care about your money
[21:16] because your your money is a means to
[21:17] help you do what you value um it's
[21:21] a yeah it's it's not just money like
[21:24] money is a resource your time is a
[21:26] resource your relationships yourx
[21:28] balance um how do we make sure all of
[21:31] things all these things are working
[21:32] cohesively for what's important to you
[21:35] again like they they they come with
[21:36] opportunity costs like if you're going
[21:38] after this for money you might be
[21:41] pulling away from relationship or you
[21:43] might be you're spending your time on
[21:44] one thing when it could be going to X so
[21:46] yeah it all feeds in together um and you
[21:50] you have to start with articulating why
[21:52] why are you doing this in the first
[21:53] place and it cannot be a goal like when
[21:56] I was younger I had a goal of like
[21:57] wanting to own a
[21:59] jet um and then someone challenged me
[22:01] like why do you want a jet that's a pain
[22:03] I was like oh it' be awesome not have to
[22:04] wait in line at TSA and all that junk it
[22:05] was like dude you don't want a private
[22:06] jet you want easier travel it's like
[22:09] well I guess so but that's the way like
[22:10] no that's the only way for easier travel
[22:13] is not to own a jet there's a lot other
[22:14] ways of doing it so I had I had
[22:16] misappropriate assigned a goal because I
[22:19] did not understand what I actually
[22:20] wanted and I think people do that all
[22:22] the time for a lot simpler things than
[22:23] Jets they do it for everything and that
[22:25] leads to a lot of anks absolutely yeah I
[22:29] it's with more material things you also
[22:31] have to care for those things you also
[22:34] have to do more with them it's really
[22:36] interesting um the this these two
[22:38] opposites of like this this toxic
[22:41] hodling want to just like have more more
[22:43] more more Bitcoin and and don't want to
[22:45] spend on anything that gives you Joy and
[22:48] the other side of like uh always have a
[22:50] zero bank balance always like living in
[22:53] the moment and don't think about the
[22:55] future at all like this is the kind of
[22:56] the two extreme that I'm seea uh I guess
[22:59] bitcoiners are tending more towards the
[23:01] the the the hling side of it uh because
[23:04] of that um let let's say uh one guy is
[23:09] on the oh I want to Stack more I want to
[23:11] huddle more um how can you see once it's
[23:16] toxic and too much or like how do you
[23:18] decide of like oh it's fine he's still
[23:21] living like how can you self assess
[23:24] someone in the like okay is he just
[23:27] obsessive now with having a bigger stack
[23:30] and don't know where he's going and and
[23:33] where is he's like all it's he's just
[23:35] planning for the future and I guess also
[23:37] Bitcoin is influencing that a lot
[23:39] because then your time preference comes
[23:41] differently because you actually look in
[23:43] the future more you're like oh like I
[23:45] see this this goals of like Bitcoin will
[23:47] hit a million at 2030 so I guess I have
[23:49] to stack like a maniac till
[23:52] 2030 yeah man um I'll tell two stories
[23:56] to try to answer that um personally
[24:00] again so I have four young kids they're
[24:02] they're seven five three and one and
[24:06] like this past year we went on a family
[24:08] vacation and we spent a pretty good
[24:10] amount of money for our vacation
[24:13] um and I could have not done that and it
[24:16] wasn't because we went there and like
[24:17] stayed in the rits or something like
[24:19] that it was just expensive to fly with
[24:20] four kids and win a car and all just
[24:23] it's expensive um I could have not done
[24:25] that and save that whatever it was seven
[24:30] eight grand or whatever
[24:32] for to buy more Bitcoin you know and a
[24:35] year ago I don't know what Bitcoin was a
[24:37] year ago it's probably around 43,000 I
[24:39] like it was there forever let's say it
[24:40] was 43 you know and that could now be
[24:44] you know 14 Grand it's like oh if I
[24:47] don't go on vacation now in a decade I
[24:50] can take them on a great vacation or a
[24:52] in in 20 years instead of that
[24:54] vacation every year that we give up we
[24:57] can just buy a house in mountains it's
[24:59] like well yeah but you want to spend
[25:02] time with your family like what are you
[25:04] trying to achieve that's what I'm trying
[25:06] to get at like what are you trying to
[25:07] achieve here and is having as much
[25:09] Bitcoin the goal or is Bitcoin itself
[25:11] trying to serve something else and so
[25:14] for instance like one thing one thing we
[25:15] do is we ask really hard questions that
[25:18] force you to be introspective again both
[25:21] personally and then if you're married as
[25:22] a as a couple um and it pulls out from
[25:26] you those things that you really value
[25:29] um uh also we have our clients create
[25:33] what I call a statement of financial
[25:35] purpose and that's basically a mission
[25:37] state with for your money so a few years
[25:40] ago I had a a client it was I was
[25:41] cooking dinner was like nine o'clock at
[25:43] night and he called like hey Jim um the
[25:47] house for sale or the house down the
[25:49] street is for sale should we buy it can
[25:51] we afford it and so we talked for a
[25:53] quick sec I answered this question can
[25:55] we afford it I was like yes you can
[25:56] afford it you won't be able to afford
[25:59] this house in Wyoming as quickly because
[26:00] you're moving this other house but like
[26:02] yeah you can so way more importantly
[26:04] like why do you want to move three
[26:05] houses down like are you nuts like
[26:07] moving is the worst thing ever you know
[26:09] um why do you want to move three houses
[26:11] down he said oh well our they live in
[26:13] Texas as do I where it's really hot he
[26:15] said well the the house three houses
[26:17] down has a pool and our current home
[26:20] doesn't and um our kids they had two
[26:23] young two young girls um two daughters
[26:26] and he said our kids whenever they hang
[26:27] out with our friends they always go to
[26:28] their friends houses because their
[26:29] friends all have pools so we don't get
[26:31] to see them that often but if we had a
[26:33] pool it would be a really good one and
[26:36] they would be more motivated to spend
[26:38] time here and therefore we would have
[26:39] more time to be around them I was like
[26:42] okay give me 10 seconds so I went and
[26:44] grabbed his statement of financial
[26:46] purpose and I just read it off to him
[26:47] and just read that we desire Financial
[26:50] Independence so we can have time to make
[26:52] memories as a family I was like look
[26:55] your daughters they were at that point
[26:56] they were uh like 12 and 10 I want to
[26:59] say it's like look your oldest is going
[27:00] to be out of the house in six years and
[27:03] your house is going to be completely
[27:04] quiet in eight years you didn't tell me
[27:07] the most important thing is to have as
[27:08] much money as possible or to be able to
[27:10] retire at 53 you said the ultimate goal
[27:12] for your money is to be able to make
[27:14] memories as a family so yeah you can
[27:17] afford the you you can afford the new
[27:19] house and according to your standard not
[27:21] mine you should probably go buy
[27:23] it um so we do that I uh I had a client
[27:29] a few weeks ago
[27:32] call and let me know that their husband
[27:34] passed away um she's he's he's 41 and
[27:39] she's 34 they have a three-year-old this
[27:42] is a family I've worked with for about
[27:43] five years
[27:45] now and
[27:47] uh not remotely
[27:50] expected um and that night she called me
[27:53] was about nine o'clock and I was working
[27:54] that night and I had to work for a few
[27:56] more hours and I went home and I just
[27:59] read my notes from our conversations for
[28:01] the last five years and uh reading
[28:03] through responses he had told me about
[28:06] things that he so one of the questions I
[28:10] ask um one of them is if money was no
[28:12] longer a care or concern what would you
[28:14] do with your life and another question
[28:16] is if you find out that if you found out
[28:18] today just at a normal doctor checkup
[28:20] that it turns out you only have five to
[28:22] 10 years left to live what would you
[28:24] change about your life and then the last
[28:27] question I ask is is if you went to the
[28:29] doctor for a routine checkup and you
[28:31] found out that you only have 24 hours
[28:33] left to live looking thinking about the
[28:35] finality of that moment what did you
[28:37] miss what did you never get to
[28:39] experience or do or become or
[28:41] see and I was reading our notes of the
[28:44] responses to those questions and
[28:45] subsequent convers conversations we've
[28:47] had over the years and when we had that
[28:49] conversation initially and the following
[28:51] five years of talking with them
[28:53] regularly I never would have thought
[28:55] that that was real for them and
[28:59] um that is very in my mind like that can
[29:04] happen that's real
[29:06] um yeah so I would I would hate for you
[29:09] to sit here and say Jim this thing's
[29:10] really important to
[29:12] me and then you don't do it like man
[29:15] it's really important that my kids know
[29:16] that I love them by the way that I spend
[29:18] my time the way that I use my words the
[29:20] things that I do with them and for them
[29:22] it's like okay I want them to know that
[29:25] but then they don't know it because I'm
[29:26] so busy working so I can
[29:28] buy a few hundred, more SATs it's like
[29:32] man that's great I love like I I I want
[29:33] to have a I do want to have money so I
[29:35] can be generous and I can do those
[29:37] things for my family but like at what
[29:40] point do I begin
[29:41] sacrificing the things that I really
[29:43] value on the altar of a of success of
[29:46] something I don't really even care about
[29:48] there is a barrier and unfortunately a
[29:50] lot of people cross I cross that
[29:51] sometimes I do with my time with my
[29:54] money with my relationships I cross that
[29:56] line but I hope that I am aware enough
[29:59] to realize hold on I'm doing that thing
[30:01] I said would derail me so I I mentioned
[30:03] earlier we do uh we talk about values
[30:05] and then goals and then tradeoffs part
[30:07] of those trade-offs is one like yeah
[30:09] what are the things that you're gonna
[30:10] have to trade like what are the things
[30:12] you're G have to give up the decisions
[30:13] you're have to make but also like what's
[30:14] the most probable thing of derailing
[30:17] what you said is important to you it's
[30:20] like ah we want to retire and also I
[30:22] want to make sure I have time with my
[30:23] kids like okay what's the most probable
[30:24] thing to derail you doing that it's like
[30:27] it's usually something fincial and then
[30:28] something non-financial it's like for me
[30:29] it's like what Jim what's the most
[30:31] probable thing for you not being able to
[30:34] have Financial Freedom at 45 and not
[30:36] spending time with your kids and your
[30:37] wife it's like well I guess I did a
[30:40] really job bad job saving and investing
[30:42] and I probably neglected my
[30:44] relationships with them um so just
[30:47] checking in there and it's like okay if
[30:49] we know it's we're doing what's called a
[30:52] premortem so a lot of times people do a
[30:53] postmortem a postmortem is simply like
[30:55] okay what was the cause of death here
[30:56] you know a pre is if this happens what's
[30:59] the most likely event that led to that
[31:01] that that event that death or whatever
[31:04] so what's the most likely event that led
[31:06] to this bad outcome and if we can
[31:08] identify the most likely things we can
[31:09] see like hey you're that thing that's
[31:11] most likely going to derail me I know
[31:13] how to navigate you because I see I can
[31:15] I saw you coming and when we can
[31:16] identify if you can if you can identify
[31:18] that preemptively and say like oh you're
[31:20] that thing that's going to try to derail
[31:22] me you're that thing of like I'm
[31:23] spending too much money and I'm not
[31:25] going to be able to have the money to
[31:27] help my kids
[31:28] with my daughter's wedding or I'm not
[31:30] gonna be able to take my kids on this
[31:31] vacation or I'm not gonna have time with
[31:33] my kids or I'm not going to be able to
[31:36] uh retire like you know that thing
[31:38] because you've identified it and I think
[31:40] most of us know that like I probably
[31:41] spent I probably spent too much money I
[31:42] didn't save enough or I worked too much
[31:45] or I invested poorly or whatever and if
[31:47] we can just first come to terms with
[31:49] that that it is and you like all right
[31:50] you're the error okay let's navigate
[31:52] around that man that's that's a really
[31:54] good inside I partnered up with coin
[31:57] vilante this is the most beautiful
[32:00] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[32:03] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[32:06] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[32:09] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[32:11] subtle elegent way to go out there and

[32:56] bought some Bitcoin coin and now the
[32:58] most important step is to keep the
[33:01] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[33:04] wallet my personal recommendation for
[33:06] harder wallet is the bitbox it's super
[33:08] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[33:11] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[33:13] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can

[33:37] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:40] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:42] where you live you even want to have a
[33:45] plan B a citizenship where you can move

[34:04] can level up your sovereignty I I love I
[34:08] love the story also because uh sometimes
[34:11] uh it's not not not about the financial
[34:14] thing but um how can we avoid then the
[34:19] flip side of that if like okay you have
[34:23] a stack of money and and then you're
[34:25] like okay but I really want to do this I
[34:28] really want to do that and then after
[34:30] like a year you you did all all the
[34:32] things you wanted to do but you have no
[34:34] money left and you're like oh [ __ ] like
[34:36] I'm inept or something like that so like
[34:38] H how do we uh now go go the other side
[34:41] and avoid uh just impulse buying on what
[34:46] we think we like or we we maybe actually
[34:49] love but we we have way more years to
[34:52] live then we have money left yeah um I
[34:55] think that can be on twofold one I feel
[34:57] like I'm broken record and I apologize
[34:58] for that but part of that is truly
[35:00] articulating what's important to you but
[35:02] then making sure that you don't fall
[35:03] fall prey to the wrong side of brain
[35:07] side of things it's like okay I want to
[35:08] do all these things now and don't worry
[35:11] 76y old Jim is not really Jim that's a
[35:13] stranger it's like no that's really me
[35:15] hopefully hopefully I'm 76 one day um
[35:17] and that's really me and I have things
[35:19] that are really important to me then am
[35:21] I robbing future gym am I robbing future
[35:24] things for the sake of now and if I am
[35:27] just one admit it and once I've admitted
[35:30] it is that trade-off worth it is it
[35:32] worth that I buy this extra thing now
[35:35] but not have that thing later on okay
[35:36] let's say I want to be able to I want to
[35:38] be able to help my kids uh my daughter
[35:41] have a wedding and my kids buy their
[35:43] first house and then I want to be able
[35:46] to uh travel regularly to see my
[35:49] grandkids one day I have four kids so
[35:51] I'll probably have somewhere between
[35:53] eight and 16 grandkids would be my guest
[35:55] in like the next 30 Years if I'm still
[35:58] working in 30 years you know in 30 years
[36:00] I'll only I'll only be 64 so if in 30
[36:03] years I'm still working and there's
[36:05] nothing wrong with work in your 60s but
[36:07] if I am I won't be able to be there as
[36:10] much with my
[36:11] grandkids so right now is it more
[36:14] important that I have do whatever my
[36:17] money today or that I'm able to be there
[36:20] with my grandkids later on make that
[36:22] decision you are choosing those things
[36:25] yes of course there's sometimes not
[36:26] choices it's like dude I i' I was born
[36:28] in poverty and I live in a third world
[36:29] country I can't have the I don't have
[36:31] the ability to make a decision to save a
[36:33] lot of money for the future it's like
[36:34] okay I recognize that um um but most
[36:37] people AR in that decision in that place
[36:39] but if so you have that ability just
[36:40] know like you are making a decision you
[36:43] are casting a vote both now and down the
[36:45] line with what's important to you I I
[36:46] love that casting a vote also because I
[36:48] think every financial decision is a vote
[36:49] for for for something really cool by the
[36:52] way I looked it up while you're saying
[36:54] it Jeff Bas also funny enough has four
[36:56] kids uh just like
[36:58] you I I I want I'm curious not to dig
[37:01] into Jeff's life I'm curious the
[37:02] relationship with his kids like I mean I
[37:05] I don't I don't know how oldest kids
[37:07] were when they got divorced I know if if
[37:09] KRA and I got a divorce right now that
[37:10] would be really hard on my kids if we
[37:12] got a divorced when my kids were 30
[37:14] that'd be really hard on my kids um so
[37:16] if you said Jim you'll be a
[37:18] billionaire but uh you're G you're you
[37:20] and your wife you're separated and your
[37:22] relationship with your kids is not the
[37:23] same like I don't care about the money
[37:26] um and that's a decision that's a
[37:27] decision you have to face every day how
[37:29] are you gonna how are you going to spend
[37:30] it interesting um it's really
[37:32] interesting also that you have as a
[37:34] financial planner the inside in the in
[37:36] the fat world and you have a lot of
[37:37] colleagues uh that probably as you said
[37:40] don't like Fe don't like Bitcoin and
[37:42] they're like why are you doing it with
[37:44] Bitcoin um how do you think uh will
[37:48] Bitcoin impact personal finances and
[37:51] this decisions as you have uh you said
[37:54] all your clients have Bitcoin uh and and
[37:58] uh you see it with your other colleagues
[38:00] they have probably a lot of clients who
[38:02] don't have Bitcoin as they don't like as
[38:04] the financial Banner don't doesn't like
[38:06] it is there a difference uh in in the
[38:09] decision making in the personal
[38:10] financials or is Bitcoin just a tool of
[38:12] money and doesn't really change a lot in
[38:14] the
[38:16] behaviors H that's an interesting
[38:18] convers uh question um I would say once
[38:22] you grasp
[38:23] Bitcoin it does at least
[38:26] change Beyond it's a separate
[38:30] allocation once you truly understand
[38:32] Bitcoin at minimal it's going to change
[38:34] how you view our money system and our
[38:37] debt system overall so
[38:41] suddenly again you can allocate 3% of
[38:43] Bitcoin and not really know what it is
[38:45] you're just doing it because like you
[38:47] know historically I would have made more
[38:49] money you know but you don't understand
[38:51] what Bitcoin is uh but once you really
[38:53] grasp what Bitcoin is you start
[38:55] realizing like wow our our whole money
[38:57] system system is outrageously broken our
[38:58] debt system is crazy broken there's
[39:00] monetary premium in like every adet out
[39:03] there so then you start thinking through
[39:05] like okay this isn't just I can
[39:07] outperform the S&P by a few percent and
[39:10] add a little bit extra to my Kar or
[39:12] something like that it's all right this
[39:15] is a not a subversion um this is a means
[39:18] of opting out of our totally broken
[39:20] money system so I will think you you
[39:22] minimally will change in that
[39:24] capacity
[39:25] um which is interesting
[39:29] because yeah I again I take a lot of
[39:31] flack from the financial planning
[39:32] Community about this stuff and I would
[39:34] say that the problem is and this is sort
[39:37] of like Jesse uh do you know Jesse Myers
[39:40] crous uh Jesse his article on uh an
[39:43] oldie but a goodie uh Bitcoin uh and the
[39:47] yepy elite uh so I see that a lot with
[39:51] financial planners so a lot of financial
[39:53] planners dismiss Bitcoin and they're
[39:55] they're a big problem they have is
[39:58] they're really good or a good financial
[40:00] planner is really good at managing
[40:02] things around your money they're great
[40:04] with tax planning and managing uh Equity
[40:07] compensation and estate planning
[40:09] navigation with your money and
[40:10] retirements and all these things they
[40:12] good with managing your money but very
[40:14] few financial planners have stopped to
[40:16] ask but what is money and if you live
[40:19] around money all the time stopping and
[40:21] asking what is money sounds like a
[40:23] really foolish thing to say but until
[40:25] you ask what is money there's no way for
[40:28] you to recognize that our money systems
[40:29] broken and until you recognize that you
[40:31] think that Bitcoin is a proposed
[40:33] solution to a non-issue and that is
[40:35] where most financial planners have a
[40:37] hard time adopting it um but once you go
[40:40] there like with clients and everything
[40:41] like once you go with like oh bitcoin's
[40:42] money and it's better money and this
[40:44] money that we've been served and this
[40:46] thing that we're familiar with is a
[40:48] broken system then it's like all right
[40:50] this is again this is not just something
[40:52] you tack on this becomes like the
[40:54] underlying thesis of our our our our
[40:57] money in that
[40:59] sense I love it a lot now the obvious
[41:02] question uh what is money for you and
[41:04] why is as Bitcoin the the perfect
[41:07] one uh so my my my definition of money
[41:10] would be money money is a means of
[41:12] communicating storing and transferring
[41:14] value across space and time so again
[41:17] money communicates value if I use my
[41:18] money for one thing if it's to put a
[41:20] roof over our head I'm saying it's
[41:22] important that we have a roof over head
[41:24] if it's to uh buy my child a gift that
[41:26] he really wants I'm communic that hey
[41:27] you having that thing is important to me
[41:29] so it's a means of communication um but
[41:31] it's also a means of storing and
[41:32] transferring value across space and time
[41:34] and obviously I think you know Bitcoin
[41:36] is superior to storing value compared to
[41:38] US dollars or the Euro or or the S&P 500
[41:42] you know that's has a monetary premium
[41:44] um so in my opinion it's a better form
[41:46] of money for storing value uh and also
[41:48] transferring value across again time
[41:50] there's the storage part there but also
[41:52] uh space uh sending you know sending
[41:54] Bitcoin is much simpler uh than sending
[41:58] uh a wire transfer especially when we
[42:00] get to uh the uh the possibility of uh
[42:05] confiscation of assets based off of I
[42:07] ate too much beef or you know the
[42:09] conspiracy conspiracy theory types
[42:11] things uh that I think are inevitable um
[42:14] one day that that the Bitcoin is
[42:16] superior for so I would say in in every
[42:19] way Bitcoin is superior money um not
[42:22] just another asset you should tack on to
[42:23] a
[42:24] portfolio that's it's it it's super
[42:27] interesting for me yeah it's it's maybe
[42:29] maybe personal finance because I I've
[42:32] done all the stocks I have done like the
[42:35] the diversification game uh but since I
[42:38] in Bitcoin I'm just all in in Bitcoin is
[42:42] is that a stupid idea I mean I'm I'm 26
[42:44] but uh would you say that's a it's a
[42:47] stupid idea for me being just all in
[42:48] Bitcoin like I told that on the on the
[42:51] podcast I think two three times already
[42:52] but uh just for your as context I
[42:55] basically have everything in bit coin I
[42:58] have a personal feat account which has a
[43:01] $10,000 limit uh and I just try to keep
[43:04] it at zero so if I have an unexpected
[43:06] expense I just pay from from the debt
[43:09] then the next time something comes up I
[43:10] go it to zero again if I have a little
[43:12] bit too much then I buy Bitcoin with
[43:14] that so I just try to keep zero fear and
[43:17] I have everything in Bitcoin you you
[43:19] said emergency fund in uh in in in US
[43:23] dollar or fat when does it make sense
[43:26] for me actually to consider oh I should
[43:28] have an emergency fund uh and and why
[43:31] does it make
[43:32] sense or am I stupid for that no there
[43:36] there's a lot of things that feed into
[43:37] that so I I wrote a paper I don't know
[43:39] probably two months ago that that helps
[43:41] me sort of triage the question of how
[43:43] much Bitcoin should I own or what
[43:45] allocation should I have to bitcoin and
[43:47] it's this again it's like this this uh
[43:49] flowchart in my head of like when you'll
[43:53] need it what you'll use it for your risk
[43:55] tolerance your R risk capacity your age
[43:57] your other assets uh expected windfalls
[44:01] unusual assets your your cash flow your
[44:03] expected future cash flow and savings
[44:05] rates like all these things feed into it
[44:08] like if you're um a very simplistic way
[44:11] of looking at this is let's say you had
[44:14] ,000 today and you have to have a ,000
[44:17] doll tomorrow um because you need to
[44:20] go buy an let's say you you wanted to
[44:23] buy an engagement ring okay I don't know
[44:25] if you're married or not let's say you
[44:26] need to go buy engagement ring and
[44:27] you're going to propose on Saturday and
[44:29] you're buying the ring on Friday and the
[44:31] ring costs a th bucks okay um and if you
[44:34] don't have a ring you can't propose
[44:35] let's just stick with me here um so
[44:38] let's say that's the case it would be
[44:40] crazy for you to go buy Bitcoin with a
[44:42] thousand if you had ,000 cash a day it'd
[44:43] be crazy to go buy Bitcoin hoping that
[44:45] Bitcoin goes up 5 percent and now you
[44:47] have 1,50 bucks because if Bitcoin goes
[44:50] down by five% you can no longer buy that
[44:52] ring and you no longer can propose to
[44:54] your girlfriend then would be fiance
[44:58] so in that sense the thing that
[45:00] determines should you own Bitcoin versus
[45:02] versus Fiat is well I need this money
[45:05] very short term what is my risk not your
[45:08] tolerance maybe your risk tolerance the
[45:11] the amount of volatility you can stomach
[45:12] would say yeah I can have full Bitcoin
[45:14] but your risk capacity your actual
[45:16] ability to absorb the risk of that
[45:18] volatility um is not is not uh suitable
[45:21] for that allocation so it's time frame
[45:24] uh capacity not just tolerance a lot of
[45:27] coiners have a very high risk tolerance
[45:28] and I I'm all for that that's totally
[45:30] fine um but assessing risk capacity your
[45:33] expected liquidity needs your savings
[45:34] rate if you said well yeah but Jim
[45:36] tomorrow I'll get another thousand doll
[45:38] it's like okay well then your your
[45:40] expected future savings uh would be able
[45:42] to replace that so I guess you could put
[45:44] all on bitcoin because it doesn't matter
[45:45] because tomorrow you'll have that um so
[45:47] there there's lots of factors I mean
[45:48] personally I I mean I'm I'm 34 um and
[45:52] then yeah KRA and I like that's
[45:54] basically all we own I own I own my
[45:55] business um own Bitcoin and I own a
[45:58] couple of stocks and it just happens to
[45:59] be that those stocks right now are
[46:00] basically all like Bitcoin adjacent
[46:02] companies as well like that's what I own
[46:05] and whenever I have excess excess money
[46:07] my decision is basically do I put more
[46:09] money in the business to hire to scale
[46:11] to invest in there or do I buy more
[46:13] Bitcoin with it like that's that's
[46:14] basically where I'm putting our money um
[46:16] and I'm fine with that but the thing is
[46:18] like I mean personally I own a business
[46:20] and the business is if if you're a
[46:22] business owner and you're a good
[46:23] business owner you should be building
[46:26] not just a job but an asset that you can
[46:28] one day sell most businesses ideally so
[46:31] my business I am building as an asset
[46:33] that I think will do really well if I
[46:36] had a W2 job that was not this asset I
[46:39] could sell I'd literally have one less
[46:41] asset so like personally despite having
[46:43] basically all of my net worth liquid net
[46:45] worth in Bitcoin I still own this asset
[46:48] that is not Bitcoin so I am in reality
[46:51] I'm 50% allocated to bitcoin um so
[46:55] there's those situations or maybe uh
[46:58] maybe you're 64 and you have elderly
[47:01] parents and you know that your your dad
[47:03] has a life insurance policy for a
[47:04] million bucks and he's 86 and has cancer
[47:07] and he'll probably'll pass away in the
[47:09] next six months well if we knew that and
[47:13] maybe you have a million dollars of
[47:14] invested assets so you're 64 you have a
[47:17] million bucks of investment assets you
[47:19] know without a fact or without a doubt
[47:20] you're going to get another million
[47:21] dollars in the next couple of years um
[47:24] and it's in a life insurance policy okay
[47:26] okay well if you know that's going to
[47:29] happen and that million dollars is a
[47:31] life insurance policy right now that's
[47:33] basically like sitting on a million
[47:34] dollars that's in cash so I would to an
[47:37] extent maybe you should discount this
[47:39] based off of your likelihood and
[47:40] probability and like when you expect to
[47:42] get that but if you're were sitting on a
[47:43] million dollars in literal cash you
[47:45] would offset that allocation by going to
[47:48] a higher allocation something more
[47:49] aggressive so again that I would that's
[47:51] another triage opportunity is am I
[47:53] expecting a windfall from something in
[47:55] what point and what likelihood do I want
[47:57] assign that thing to happening and that
[47:59] will also determine um how much should
[48:01] you have so um I am most people would
[48:05] say I am sort of nuts I mean bitcoiners
[48:07] would say that maybe I'm
[48:09] conservative um maybe I don't know um
[48:12] but um yeah I think that's a big
[48:17] question that has to take in like a
[48:19] zillion
[48:21] considerations but no I don't I don't
[48:23] think you're crazy I don't know you're
[48:24] you said you're 26 are you married
[48:25] single like do you have big expenses on
[48:27] the horizon like there's there's those
[48:29] types of things you have to
[48:30] navigate yeah absolutely and uh that's
[48:33] the thing like
[48:35] I F first of all I'm a little bit calm
[48:39] because half of my Bitcoin or one third
[48:42] of my Bitcoin something like that uh is
[48:46] uh not taxable because of the tax in in
[48:48] in AUST because I bought them before
[48:51] they became taxable now all Bitcoin that
[48:53] uh thing that's that makes me a little
[48:55] bit calmer because can actually sell
[48:57] them without having a huge tax bill uh
[49:00] and I have no um really big um expenses
[49:05] that I expect anytime soon uh that that
[49:08] that's what comes down but yeah um I'm a
[49:11] little bit more conservative already
[49:13] because like a few years ago a few years
[49:15] like two years ago I was even on
[49:17] Leverage I I put like this 110
[49:20] 115% I got down from that uh because now
[49:24] I'm selfemployed now I'm completely on
[49:26] on my own so probably uh as the
[49:31] responsibility grows and me and my
[49:33] girlfriend maybe are married and maybe
[49:35] have kids one day or my business is not
[49:38] just me or maybe some there are some
[49:39] employees then obviously uh there are
[49:42] unexpected things if it's just yourself
[49:45] uh it's it's easy to to know what's
[49:47] going on but if there if they kids
[49:49] involved or employees involved then I
[49:51] then the the thing grows the the demand
[49:54] for for an emergency fund a rainy day
[49:56] fund it way way bigger in my opinion
[49:59] dude if I if I was a single guy in 26 I
[50:01] would probably be living in a like a van
[50:03] like in the mountain somewhere and my
[50:05] cost of living would be nothing um and
[50:07] it's like yeah I could put everything
[50:07] into Bitcoin and like what's the worst
[50:09] thing that's gonna happen like you're
[50:10] not going to repo my van um like that's
[50:12] it so you know there's these there's
[50:14] lots of factors to consider here and
[50:16] heck even if you do own other assets
[50:18] what are those assets in you know like
[50:20] let's say I don't know what you would
[50:21] assign as the most likely event to make
[50:24] Bitcoin go down by 80% at this moment
[50:26] but let's say that 80% drop of Bitcoin
[50:29] would be catastrophic to your situation
[50:32] so you own other assets but let's say
[50:35] the most let's say you would think the
[50:37] most likely event for a massive Bitcoin
[50:39] drop would be a macro a a an adverse
[50:42] macroeconomic event okay well
[50:44] theoretically in that situation if
[50:46] you're Diversified by owning the SNP the
[50:48] S&P in that probably in that situation
[50:50] would also drop drastically so what
[50:53] other thing do you own to diversify out
[50:55] of Bitcoin and at what what role is that
[50:58] trying to play are you trying to hedge
[51:00] against this big macro event you
[51:02] probably shouldn't own I don't know um
[51:05] an equivalent type of asset like I'm not
[51:09] saying you should go buy a bunch of like
[51:10] long duration bonds but like what is
[51:13] your what is the uh other side of that
[51:16] barbell said Jim I do need to own
[51:18] something that's not Bitcoin again like
[51:19] what do you what do you what are you
[51:20] throwing in there to offset risk and
[51:22] again you have to start you have to
[51:24] assess like what are risks uh what's the
[51:26] risk to my portfolio and how do I
[51:28] allocate around this thing and that
[51:29] could be I don't know like personally I
[51:31] think a way that you can do that is by
[51:32] like buying like value funds or deep
[51:34] value or or Commodities or again like
[51:37] there's a lot of ways you go about this
[51:39] uh it depends on what you what you
[51:41] define as risk and assess for a proper
[51:43] hedge I love that a lot yeah this this
[51:46] episode is really good already I love it
[51:48] one um topic one Avenue I really want to
[51:51] go into because I know it's extremely
[51:54] popular uh just from the data get from
[51:57] the from the from the podcast is
[52:00] retiring on bitcoin and I had I think
[52:04] like at least like 10 episodes around
[52:06] that but I've not 100% like there are
[52:09] lot all those calculators where you can
[52:11] put in like when do you start withdrawal
[52:13] like what's your living expenses all
[52:15] that stuff like there's a lot of axle
[52:17] magic happening with ret retrying on uh
[52:20] retiring on something but how do you go
[52:23] ahead if you're like okay you're in a
[52:24] job that you don't really hate but
[52:27] you're also not really satisfied with it
[52:29] and uh you don't let's say you don't
[52:31] have a way out uh probably have a way
[52:33] out but let's say for the argument sake
[52:35] you don't have a way out how do you go
[52:37] ahead and say like how do I actually
[52:40] calculate how many Bitcoin I need to
[52:41] retire what what do have to need to Tak
[52:44] in concept like how do you look at that
[52:47] topic that's probably currently the
[52:50] hardest question that I'm routinely
[52:52] asked um because usually when I'm asked
[52:55] that question it comes comes from
[52:56] someone with deep conviction who says
[53:00] that thinks that number is super low um
[53:04] what I mean by that is I'll see people
[53:06] write I see this on like Twitter all the
[53:08] time um if you're that person I'm not
[53:10] hating on you I'm just saying it's an
[53:11] observation I have is I'll see people
[53:14] tweeting that you only need half a
[53:19] Bitcoin to be in the top percent of the
[53:21] people in the world and you could retire
[53:23] off half of Bitcoin and they that's
[53:25] that's the Tweet but then two days later
[53:27] they'll tweet something of like I'll
[53:29] never have enough Bitcoin and like keep
[53:32] stacking it's like okay which one is it
[53:36] and the problem is that a lot of people
[53:37] come to me who are really convicted of
[53:39] Bitcoin and they want to know how much
[53:41] Bitcoin do I have to have and they come
[53:43] to me with some sort of narrative in
[53:45] their head that two Bitcoin is enough to
[53:48] retire but it's like dude when are we
[53:51] talking about like two Bitcoin was not
[53:53] enough to retire two years ago
[53:56] a 100 Bitcoin was not enough to retire a
[53:58] decade ago it's enough to retire today
[54:01] if Bitcoin keeps doing what you think
[54:02] you'll do if Bitcoin drops to a dollar
[54:04] again it's not enough to re you know
[54:05] like theoretically let's say it happens
[54:06] like I don't think it's gonna happen um
[54:08] but the point being when will it be used
[54:12] so a large issue is people throw out uh
[54:18] statements without qualifying them
[54:20] enough I am I try to be very measured
[54:23] with my words so I'm not going to say
[54:25] you need two Bitcoin to retire because
[54:28] if you retire today with two Bitcoin
[54:30] that's US dollar equivalent at this
[54:32] moment because what's really important
[54:33] we're not looking at a dollar equivalent
[54:35] we're looking at purchasing power but to
[54:38] simp simplify purchasing power the
[54:39] dollar equivalent is used so right now
[54:41] two Bitcoin is what $135,000 roughly
[54:44] like if
[54:46] Bitcoin let's say Bitcoin doubles in the
[54:48] next year okay just theoretically the
[54:50] Bitcoin doubles the next year but I
[54:52] spend 150 Grand per year all right well
[54:56] between now and when that's doubled I'm
[54:59] spending what uh 12 and change per month
[55:03] so I have not given my two Bitcoin
[55:06] enough time to grow in that time so I
[55:10] just ate most of my seed okay now let's
[55:14] say we get to end that phase and now I
[55:16] have 1.2 Bitcoin and that 1.2 Bitcoin is
[55:19] now worth again we're back to it of like
[55:22] I have 1.2 Bitcoin it doubled so let's
[55:24] call
[55:24] 130,000 so
[55:27] uh uh was it 1326
[55:30] $156,000 so I have roughly where I'm at
[55:32] right now well if Bitcoin does again the
[55:35] next year what we think it'll do like
[55:37] all right I'm slowly eating the seed
[55:39] that I need but if Bitcoin drops to by
[55:42] 20% let's say well suddenly that
[55:44] literally I ran out of I ran out of
[55:46] money after like what two maybe three
[55:48] years um so you
[55:51] are I don't know my brain works in bad
[55:53] analogies it's like if you were a farmer
[55:56] it's like Jim how many seeds do I have
[55:58] to buy in order to make an orchard one
[56:01] question is at what point will you when
[56:03] were you going to take those seeds that
[56:05] the trees produce and plant more trees
[56:07] versus at what point are you going to
[56:09] start eating this the uh the fruit that
[56:11] that that that that those trees provide
[56:13] and no longer planting anymore um
[56:16] because if I if I plant a seed and then
[56:19] I'm greedy and I need to eat that seed
[56:21] right now I don't have enough time for
[56:22] that seed to grow and produce more and
[56:24] more and that's that's a risk of saying
[56:25] you only need Bitcoin to retire again
[56:27] it's the same risk of saying it a decade
[56:29] ago you only need 100 Bitcoin to retire
[56:32] um I just said lots of words without
[56:34] answering your question um I will say
[56:37] this um I I wrote I did again when I was
[56:40] writing that paper a few months back
[56:41] around like thoughts through allocating
[56:43] to bitcoin um I did do some math in the
[56:47] background um I did not publish this
[56:49] because I don't want like compliance and
[56:51] SEC people breathing down my neck but I
[56:54] did do a lot of math to see like well
[56:55] roughly what allocation would you need
[56:57] in order to sustain your P your real
[57:00] purchasing power of a portfolio um if
[57:02] you replace it with Bitcoin this is not
[57:05] a guarantee this is not investment
[57:07] advice this is not tax legal advice all
[57:09] the disclosures okay uh but in my in my
[57:13] thought and research in that if you had
[57:16] roughly in today's today's date again
[57:18] this this numb is going to change but at
[57:20] today if you had roughly 4% of your
[57:23] portfolio of investable assets and
[57:26] Bitcoin if Bitcoin does what I and I
[57:28] think you would think it will do that
[57:31] over time would allow your your real
[57:32] purchasing power to stay flat therefore
[57:35] if you had greater than 4% it would go
[57:36] up in theory and if you had less than 4%
[57:38] it would go down how I came to that
[57:40] conclusion is assigning monetary
[57:44] premiums to those other assets and the
[57:46] probability of the monetary premium
[57:48] being sucked out and assign to bitcoin
[57:51] so like if Bitcoin does what we think it
[57:54] will do in that
[57:57] situation the value of Bitcoin has to go
[58:00] up the real value of Bitcoin has to go
[58:02] up to the detriment of other Assets Now
[58:06] you can see the nominal value of those
[58:07] assets go up so if the if the US prints
[58:09] a bazillion dollars and stocks and real
[58:12] estate and gold and bonds all go up a
[58:15] bunch um and your Bitcoin goes up along
[58:18] with it you look like you have more
[58:19] money but you've lost purchasing power
[58:21] okay especially against Bitcoin all
[58:23] right so in real terms Bitcoin has to go
[58:27] up to the detriment of the other's
[58:28] assets and again that's where like if it
[58:31] if if Bitcoin sucks out the monetary pre
[58:33] premium of the s&p500 and your bond fund
[58:35] and your real estate holdings um and you
[58:37] have less than again my my thought here
[58:39] is if you have less than 4% too much
[58:41] value is gonna be sucked out of your
[58:42] other assets assigned to bitcoin you
[58:43] don't own enough Bitcoin to to capture
[58:46] that real rise there therefore you in
[58:48] you are the net negative of value
[58:51] retention um 4% right now would be my
[58:54] guess of sustain
[58:56] greater than that would be the growth
[58:58] again not advice that's just my personal
[59:02] research I don't know how to disclose
[59:04] anything else don't take that as
[59:04] investment advice talk to an attorney
[59:07] and Tax Advisor and invest
[59:09] advisor we can just let like a black
[59:11] screen with a bunch of disclaimers run
[59:14] over the screen I didn't yeah I didn't
[59:16] publish those numbers in that research
[59:17] because I didn't want to just get raked
[59:18] over the calls by everyone out there
[59:20] who's like oh that guy said a number
[59:21] it's like dude can I not have a thought
[59:24] um so anyways yeah that that that's why
[59:27] that's where I came to my my my thought
[59:28] is and that's all obviously that's
[59:29] running assumptions that Bitcoin will do
[59:31] what I think it'll do and that that will
[59:32] come at the monetary premium removal all
[59:35] these things um but that that's the
[59:37] closest I could get to an answer now
[59:39] personally I have a lot more Bitcoin
[59:41] than obviously I told you earlier I have
[59:42] a lot more Bitcoin than 4% and and uh
[59:44] our clients basically have uh a lot more
[59:47] than that too um to the point that a lot
[59:50] of people think it's crazy I again like
[59:53] I said earlier most financial planners
[59:54] think I'm really stupid I think they're
[59:56] really wrong I don't think you I don't
[59:58] care if you think I'm stupid if I think
[59:59] you're wrong like I think you're you're
[60:00] thinking I'm stupid from an unfound
[60:02] basis and I really don't care um so
[60:04] that's where we
[60:07] are I I imagine like a financial planner
[60:10] conference where you the one like hey
[60:13] Bitcoin yeah I
[60:15] purposely uh I mean dayto day I I come
[60:18] to my office right down the street from
[60:19] my house and like today I'm actually
[60:21] dressed up pretty nice I'm wearing some
[60:22] jeans but usually I'm wearing like a
[60:23] swimsuit t-shirt and my sandals um
[60:26] pretty chill um you know I'm trying to
[60:28] get dressed in the morning with four
[60:29] kids hanging off me like I'm not going
[60:31] to get put a suit on um uh but yeah I
[60:34] purposely like when I go to like Bitcoin
[60:36] conferences or things like that I try to
[60:38] always wear like a Bitcoin shirt just to
[60:40] uh I like to be that sore thumb it's fun
[60:44] um I've always I've always wanted to be
[60:46] like a closet genius you know the movie
[60:48] good Goodwill Hunting I've always wanted
[60:49] to be like will like a closet genius the
[60:51] problem is I'm not a genius so the
[60:53] closest I can get is being a closet sort
[60:56] a smart guy um but uh but yeah I like I
[61:00] like going to like yeah financial
[61:01] planning like things and uh uh trying
[61:06] not that I'm trying to ruffle feathers
[61:08] but I would love like what frustrates me
[61:09] about financial planners who don't
[61:11] understand Bitcoin and don't talk to
[61:12] their clients about it is they trust you
[61:14] with their money like you're not
[61:15] impacting yourself you're impacting a
[61:17] hundred or a thousand families um and
[61:21] that's frustrating especially like
[61:23] there's people I talk to it's like oh
[61:24] yeah our clients are 80% long Bond BS
[61:26] and hey the the yield curves fallen so
[61:28] our bonds are going to do really well
[61:30] it's like dude like what are you doing
[61:32] um that makes me mad because again
[61:34] they're dealing with like you really you
[61:36] start thinking this who they're who
[61:37] they're working with you put a face to
[61:38] it uh I mean I that's why I get red up
[61:41] when it comes like inflation like
[61:43] inflation's frustrating but then you
[61:45] think of the cancelon effect and you
[61:46] think through like who benefits then you
[61:49] picture the old lady at the grocery
[61:51] store whose husband died 20 years ago
[61:53] and now she lives off her deceased
[61:55] husband's pinch and when he died it was
[61:57] 2,000 bucks and today it's still 2,000
[61:58] bucks there's no cost of living
[61:59] adjustment and she used to be able to be
[62:01] fine on that and now she's about to get
[62:03] evicted and she's only eating one meal a
[62:05] day because she's on the wrong end of
[62:07] the cancel on effect like that's when
[62:09] you put a face to this you tell you
[62:11] actually bring it you're not making up
[62:12] stories this stuff is real when you do
[62:14] that it's like okay this is why this is
[62:16] important um and I've talked to these
[62:19] people I've talk to a ton of people
[62:20] about their money um yeah it's it's it's
[62:24] real and that's that's I am very at
[62:27] because of these
[62:28] things why why do those financial
[62:30] planners uh don't don't get it do they
[62:33] have to unlearn more of of of the fear
[62:35] like why do they don't question what is
[62:38] what is money as you said
[62:39] before I think it's the yeah it's well
[62:42] it's the they don't question what is
[62:43] money and I think that comes
[62:45] from I don't know like why does do well
[62:48] not that fish maybe fish do ask like
[62:51] does a fish ask what is water you know I
[62:53] don't I don't know like can they think
[62:55] about that even but let's just say they
[62:56] could do fish ask what is water um and I
[62:59] think that's what the problem is a lot
[63:00] of financial advisers live in water and
[63:02] therefore that's not they're not gonna
[63:03] ask what is it I've always been uh um I
[63:07] was a I was a terrible student through
[63:10] college really bad like I had a 26 GPA I
[63:13] think my wife had a 40 in high school
[63:15] and college and a few years ago she had
[63:17] to go get my GPA for something and uh
[63:19] she had to go pick it up and I said hey
[63:21] babe when they give it to you please
[63:22] don't make fun of me um like and also
[63:24] just don't think I've a toal [ __ ]
[63:26] please and she was like what is it I was
[63:27] like it's just embarrassing she's like
[63:28] what is it like a 36 I was like man if
[63:30] you if that's embarrassing you're going
[63:31] to think you married a total [ __ ] um I
[63:34] was just a really bad student and what I
[63:36] realized after college and everything
[63:38] once I started like finding what I like
[63:39] in in finance is I'm actually really
[63:41] good student but I have to sit on the
[63:43] front row and I have to ask the dumb
[63:45] questions that's what I've realized I've
[63:47] I want to be smart I don't want to I
[63:48] don't care if I appear to be smart I
[63:50] want to be smart I don't care if I
[63:52] appear to be stupid as long as I'm not
[63:54] no longer stupid
[63:56] and I think a lot of people won't do
[63:57] that so I'm the guy when a question when
[63:59] something's going on in a lecture and
[64:01] it's like man I definitely should know
[64:03] what he's saying but I definitely don't
[64:05] and if he continues on I'm not gonna
[64:07] make it through this class at all I'd
[64:09] rather raise my hand and ask the dumb
[64:11] question like hey what's water and it's
[64:13] like that guy's an idiot I know there's
[64:15] like nine other people in the classroom
[64:16] who are wondering the same thing and
[64:18] that's where we are on finance but no
[64:19] one want no one wants to ask the dumb
[64:21] question of what's money you look like
[64:22] an idiot it's like well I'd rather look
[64:24] like an idiot than actually be one um
[64:27] and I think that's where like bitcoiners
[64:28] will come like well what is it I'm okay
[64:31] to like you know look like a fool and
[64:33] ask the simple questions I I wish I'd
[64:35] have known this back in college like I
[64:37] took macroeconomics and and and
[64:38] microeconomics know that stuff made
[64:40] sense to me it's it's because they
[64:41] taught keyy and economics I wish I'd
[64:43] have raised my hands and said hey this
[64:45] doesn't make sense but I was afraid to
[64:47] say that because I thought maybe it's
[64:49] the I'm the only one it didn't make
[64:50] sense for well it's because I didn't
[64:51] have a radar that like no it truly
[64:53] doesn't make sense and if I would have
[64:54] pressed them on that your view of
[64:56] Economics doesn't make sense maybe it's
[64:59] because I'm stupid or maybe it's because
[65:01] it's broken at least they would have had
[65:02] to articulate to me why it's not broken
[65:06] when you know Kings in economics is um
[65:08] but I was afraid of looking foolish um
[65:11] and now it's like I'll look like a fool
[65:13] all day I don't care as long as I'm not
[65:14] one um so I think it's that maybe maybe
[65:18] there's a lot smarter than I am and I'm
[65:19] missing
[65:23] everything it's it's funny I'm you uh I
[65:28] I have those moments like if you have a
[65:30] daily Bitcoin podcast it's really hard
[65:32] to not be super bullish on bitcoin like
[65:34] you you you talk with a bullish Bitcoin
[65:37] every day and you're like oh [ __ ] like I
[65:39] have a real formo here like I have to
[65:41] get to more Bitcoin it's it's it's it's
[65:43] contagious definitely so but but
[65:45] sometimes I'm like maybe maybe we are
[65:48] actually the foolish one like maybe our
[65:50] small group is wrong but but I don't
[65:52] think so definitely don't think so and
[65:54] we getting uh big big with every day and
[65:57] I do think so that financial planners
[66:00] who don't have a Bitcoin strategy at
[66:02] some point will look foolish like
[66:04] they're like why why didn't you tell me
[66:06] five years ago of Bitcoin so I think
[66:08] like financial planners should um save
[66:11] their face and then learn about Bitcoin
[66:13] and now like it's so obvious now I feel
[66:15] like dude yeah I think you are breaching
[66:17] your fiduciary duty I wouldn't I
[66:20] wouldn't go as far to say if all of your
[66:21] clients don't own Bitcoin I'm not going
[66:23] to say that you're breaching your
[66:24] financial fiduciary duty but if you
[66:26] can't at minimum give a good reason why
[66:28] they shouldn't own Bitcoin and I when I
[66:30] say good reason it's not because it's
[66:31] beanie babies or
[66:33] because whatever give a good reason if
[66:36] you can't do that you're speaking to
[66:37] something you don't understand you need
[66:39] to least admit that so if they ask hey
[66:40] why I own Bitcoin you say I don't
[66:42] understand it say that but there's lack
[66:46] of honesty there it's like obviously No
[66:48] One's Gonna most people don't admit that
[66:50] they think they understand it they think
[66:51] that it's they think they think it's
[66:53] beanie babies or tulips but that's
[66:56] because it's coming from a place of lack
[66:58] lack of Education you know someone asked
[67:00] me about something I don't understand
[67:02] there's a lot of them um I'll say I
[67:05] don't know but I'll do my best to get
[67:06] you an answer real quick let me go check
[67:08] around and I'll ask someone who's way
[67:09] smarter me than me in that area I'm not
[67:11] gonna say oh well you shouldn't do that
[67:14] thing and I'll just make something up
[67:16] like that'd be nuts of me to do but that
[67:18] happens all the time in Bitcoin um yeah
[67:21] and I think that's really wrong and will
[67:23] become apparent that it's really wrong
[67:26] in the future absolutely and I think we
[67:29] we have to get to a point where it's
[67:30] normal to say oh I have to research oh I
[67:33] did not build an opinion on that like I
[67:35] think like not even like Financial
[67:37] Banner but like in general we we when
[67:40] there's a topic discussed and and for
[67:42] example like a war it's I I brought it
[67:45] up before in a podcast but I think it's
[67:47] really soothing um on a family table or
[67:51] or some friends table and they they talk
[67:53] about the Ukraine and Russia War I'm the
[67:56] one saying like I have no clue about
[67:58] that and I didn't do any research on
[68:01] that war whatsoever and people called me
[68:03] crazy like how can you not have an
[68:05] opinion like I don't like I I didn't do
[68:07] any research I have no clue what's going
[68:10] on I didn't I don't know I know there's
[68:12] Putin I don't I know there's sski but
[68:14] that that's my knowledge of I have no
[68:16] clue about it and it's okay for me to
[68:19] admit that uh and because I have no
[68:22] knowledge like I'm not willing to have
[68:25] an opinion on that because that would be
[68:27] foolish of me even on that subject so I
[68:29] think we we have to get a to a point
[68:31] where it's okay to say I don't
[68:34] know yes exactly and it's then it's
[68:37] willing to say like well is that
[68:38] important enough for some to be
[68:39] something that I should learn about or
[68:42] is it not like I don't
[68:44] know how I don't know how most things at
[68:47] my house work like I have no clue I
[68:50] don't know how the heck I'm seeing you
[68:51] right now like I don't know how I'm
[68:52] seeing you and you're seeing me and
[68:54] we're talking together no clue do I need
[68:56] to know not really um so what is
[68:59] important enough for me to say like I
[69:00] need to know that um and if I don't know
[69:04] it would be really like you said it'd be
[69:05] foolish for me to chime in I think it's
[69:07] a big problem I mean it's I think it's
[69:08] always been a problem that's why like
[69:10] gossip and all that stuff is not
[69:11] something new it's it's you know
[69:12] Millennia old um but like obviously it's
[69:15] just Amplified on social media everyone
[69:17] has an opinion about everything even
[69:18] it's something you have no clue what
[69:19] you're talking about because it's better
[69:20] to have an opinion than it is to not uh
[69:23] supposedly it's like dude you're you're
[69:25] you're just saying things you have zero
[69:27] education on that's a frustrating thing
[69:28] like in the US here it's like yes I'm
[69:31] all this man it's gonna sound bad if
[69:32] should say it like
[69:35] um I think yes everyone should be able
[69:38] to vote you know whatever that's that's
[69:39] a that's a right that we have in the US
[69:40] but man it's pretty frustrating when
[69:42] some absolute goober who has no clue
[69:45] about anything has the same waiting of a
[69:48] vote that I have not that I have
[69:50] everything figured out but man there are
[69:51] some people that's like man you can vote
[69:54] uh and as a same weight as me and maybe
[69:57] that's something like I shouldn't be
[69:59] able to go into a a Tech Convention and
[70:04] decide how this piece of technology is
[70:06] built and have the same weight as
[70:08] Satoshi like he knows more than me I'd
[70:11] say I'm gonna
[70:13] Advocate bow out of my thing and say
[70:15] with his and maybe I should have a voice
[70:16] on how something is done or what it has
[70:18] in or whatever but like I probably
[70:20] shouldn't chime in um now I guess to
[70:24] come with a lot of FL like Jim saying
[70:25] that not everyone should be able to
[70:26] votee and you have to be like him and
[70:28] you have to have everyone needs to agree
[70:29] with me it's like no it's not much TR to
[70:31] say it's like I just recognize that I
[70:33] probably shouldn't talk about certain
[70:34] things um and yes like may there's a lot
[70:38] of stuff I I there's a lot of things I
[70:40] don't have an opinion on it's like I
[70:41] need to go learn more about that before
[70:42] I can have opinion um and that's where a
[70:44] lot of I guess it goes back to the whole
[70:45] Bitcoin things people have a lot people
[70:47] have really strong opinions about
[70:48] something they know know nothing about
[70:51] um and that's that's the dangerous part
[70:53] is uh deep conv
[70:56] without deep education uh when proper
[70:59] education builds proper conviction um
[71:02] people put the cart in front of the
[71:03] horse Unfortunately they get and that
[71:06] that's called hype or fear um and hype
[71:10] can come when you have deep conviction
[71:12] that you don't on something you don't
[71:13] understand and that's why you have these
[71:14] big boom and bus Cycles with crypto
[71:16] that's hype driven not conviction driven
[71:18] and conviction driven would be built on
[71:21] education um but that's also why you
[71:23] have a new high of below is because each
[71:27] having cycle you have a new educated
[71:29] base that's building up so education
[71:30] builds conviction which builds strong
[71:32] hands and unfortunately there's just too
[71:34] much hype which is the antithesis of
[71:36] Education um it again that that that
[71:39] lack of education and those those those
[71:41] actions strong actions without education
[71:45] uh can be very dangerous both from a
[71:47] hype perspective or from a fear
[71:50] perspective oh the sky is falling it's
[71:51] like dude no you just you don't
[71:53] understand what's happening here um so
[71:55] so it can go both
[71:56] ways a
[71:58] that's lot of hit and now I'm just
[72:02] talking I I love it really cool um
[72:05] unfortunately we are already kind of in
[72:07] the in the end scene of the of the
[72:09] podcast um really interesting question I
[72:11] have always for my guest that is always
[72:14] the same question for each guest I model
[72:16] it a little bit uh instead of Bitcoin I
[72:19] use the word finances for you what can
[72:21] we learn from you besides finances goes
[72:25] back to I don't know that many things um
[72:28] I would say one going back to what do
[72:32] you
[72:33] value and helping go back to that that's
[72:36] easy to lose track of and lose sight
[72:39] of um so try to try to glean that maybe
[72:43] you're doing a great job that's
[72:43] fantastic at least be reminded of it
[72:46] um yeah what do you value um and uh
[72:51] thinking through things deeper so like
[72:54] this whole Bitcoin Rabbit Hole I think
[72:56] unfortunately a lot of
[72:58] people are go down the rabbit hole of
[73:01] Bitcoin and think they arrive at Deep
[73:03] truth and the deepest truth possible um
[73:07] but I I think that's a shame to think
[73:08] that you found the ultimate truth
[73:09] because you found Bitcoin which is just
[73:11] a better form of money so um yeah I
[73:14] would I would I would say that that that
[73:16] is something you should should dig into
[73:17] some more absolutely really cool um we
[73:21] have ENT in the podcast where the
[73:22] previous guest is asking a question for
[73:24] the next guest without knowing who the
[73:25] next guest actually is and your question
[73:28] from the previous guest is what has been
[73:30] the biggest impact of Bitcoin in your
[73:32] life I was curious what my question
[73:34] would be um probably that I'm just
[73:37] flipping rich now I'm just kidding um
[73:40] like
[73:41] what um the biggest impact of Bitcoin in
[73:45] my life ah man I don't know I I I talk
[73:49] about Bitcoin a ton um both
[73:52] professionally and personally ah so many
[73:56] relationships
[73:57] and ah I don't want to start saying
[74:00] things so the biggest if I had to still
[74:02] it down to one thing the biggest I mean
[74:04] frankly it's probably both my personal
[74:06] financial life and then the the again I
[74:10] I have the in the the honored invitation
[74:13] to speak into deeply into a lot of
[74:17] people's lives financially and the
[74:19] ability to bring Bitcoin to them is
[74:24] amazing
[74:26] um so it's not just my personal
[74:27] financial side of things it's okay I
[74:30] understand this and I can now Usher that
[74:32] into other people and help them
[74:33] understand Bitcoin and how it can fit
[74:35] into their financial life as well um
[74:37] it's pretty big because I'd be doing I'd
[74:39] be working with people financially
[74:40] anyways uh and I think I do a lot better
[74:42] job because of that now I love that I
[74:45] really really love that really cool
