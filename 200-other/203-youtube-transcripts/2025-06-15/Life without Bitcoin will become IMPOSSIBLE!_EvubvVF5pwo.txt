[00:00] you have to use it because if you don't
[00:02] you're going to fall so far behind that
[00:04] life just becomes like untenable Bitcoin
[00:06] is very defensible it's easy to protect
[00:09] it's hard to steal the return on
[00:11] investment for violence goes down the
[00:13] existence of Bitcoin kind of forces
[00:15] fiscal responsibility on everyone but
[00:18] States in particular because they've
[00:19] previously had the privilege to you know
[00:22] print money as they choose and the
[00:24] citizenry has to pick up the bill you're
[00:26] just limiting the set of people who you
[00:28] can steal from cuz you can only really
[00:30] steal from people who don't have Bitcoin
[00:32] it basically makes Empires less
[00:34] profitable and so I think states are
[00:36] going to shrink Bitcoin gives you the
[00:38] incentive to provide value and not to
[00:41] cheat obviously inflation taxes are
[00:43] undemocratic and most people don't even
[00:46] know that that's what that is they just
[00:47] see the prices go up and they think
[00:49] that's like the way it's has to be they
[00:51] don't even know that they're being taxed
[00:52] countries that adopt the Bitcoin
[00:54] standard would do better and I think
[00:55] people are going to have a really hard
[00:57] time denying that inflation right now
[01:00] doesn't mean the increase of the money
[01:03] supply the way it used to like that that
[01:05] used to be what that word meant it's
[01:07] like it think about the word you inflate
[01:09] something what are you inflating you're
[01:10] inflating the amount of money now
[01:12] inflation means the CPI if we give
[01:15] government's the ability to print money
[01:17] when there's emergencies they're going
[01:19] to make up
[01:20] [Music]
[01:23] emergencies as soon as the search engine
[01:27] um as those came it was just like oh
[01:29] actually actually this is cool but it's
[01:31] it's the search engine moment was a
[01:33] little bit like with AI and jbt I feel
[01:36] like like jbd a lot of people all all of
[01:39] the sudden like kind of imagined oh like
[01:42] it's actually like really good and it's
[01:43] actually we can do something with that
[01:45] because it made it so interactable like
[01:48] it made it uh real and before it was
[01:50] like oh yeah that's eii but it's just
[01:52] like weird hype words that companies use
[01:55] to charge a premium and that was like
[01:58] kind of the perception before that uh
[02:00] and now it's like oh yeah
[02:02] like I I use jbd now every day at least
[02:07] like three times for the podcast and all
[02:10] the things like I use J so much it it's
[02:13] kind of frightens me to be honest I
[02:15] don't I I almost not Google anymore like
[02:18] Googling is like maybe once a day and
[02:21] jbd is like I only have I also have a
[02:23] lot of small gbds written for myself
[02:26] that do some tasks in the podcast
[02:29] process
[02:30] and just processing uh text and finding
[02:33] tags and finding summaries and finding
[02:36] time stamps and a lot of things even
[02:38] like in questions it it assists me
[02:40] because I just can give him the name
[02:43] it's like okay what are the 10 most
[02:45] controversial opinions what are the 10
[02:47] most interesting topics that he
[02:49] discussed what are like some podcasts we
[02:51] he r on and what and it's just like one
[02:54] prompt I just give the name and I have
[02:56] like three pages of information and I
[02:59] didn't have to search for that that's
[03:01] crazy that that's really cool I love
[03:03] that type of stuff this stuff is going
[03:05] to revolutionize and it's gonna it's
[03:09] going to allow the Fiat games to
[03:13] continue oh you're saying that the that
[03:16] eii is continuing the field games I mean
[03:19] I guess we can already jump into the
[03:21] podcast uh I usually have a quite casual
[03:24] jump in anyways um so so you're saying
[03:28] that eii
[03:30] is um enhancing the the feat game and
[03:34] never thought about that yeah well it's
[03:37] uh it's just another wave of positive
[03:39] productivity that is going to allow them
[03:42] to um to steal more without it actually
[03:46] biting you in terms of like too much
[03:49] like actual inflation right it's the
[03:52] Jeff Booth argument of um you're not you
[03:56] know you're you're just counting from
[03:57] zero you're not thinking about the
[04:00] productivity gains that would have
[04:01] occurred to you if the money was hard
[04:05] and so I I think this is another thing
[04:07] that's going to be able to save them a
[04:08] little bit and uh allow the the music to
[04:13] keep playing for longer you know
[04:16] personal computers already did this for
[04:18] them and um I think AI can do the same
[04:21] exact thing it's an interesting thought
[04:22] because um just when I think about my
[04:25] own podcast I simply could not do a da
[04:29] da Bitcoin podcast without the EI tools
[04:32] that like it's it's impossible for me if
[04:35] you strip away the EI tools that I use
[04:37] currently uh and thinking about doing
[04:39] the podcast in the same quality same
[04:43] quantity it's just not possible at that
[04:46] point exactly you're like a thre man
[04:48] operation right now or more and and so
[04:51] like your productivity is just like
[04:53] ridiculous compared to what you could be
[04:55] even three years ago which is something
[04:57] to think about and and it's going to hit
[05:00] unevenly it's going to hit some areas uh
[05:04] more than others but but yeah it's uh it
[05:08] I think it's going to it's going to
[05:09] raise productivity across Society quite
[05:11] a bit and but instead of getting lower
[05:14] prices we're just going to get more
[05:15] money printing I guess so too and this
[05:18] point of like we're not starting off
[05:20] zero that's from Jeff po it's it's such
[05:21] a easy thing to say but it's also a
[05:24] fundamental shift that you have to do in
[05:26] your own head and I think sometimes we
[05:28] are still in this this field mindset
[05:30] even though we are talking about Bitcoin
[05:32] all day long uh and it's like what would
[05:35] the deflation be when we would not had
[05:39] uh mining this this Fiat uh printing I
[05:43] didn't even know the name uh this this
[05:45] whole money printing game if we would
[05:47] not had that we would have crazy
[05:49] productivity gains and everything would
[05:52] always be falling so and the the one
[05:56] thing that I come back is like you can
[05:58] now already see that The bitcoiners Who
[06:00] adopt the Bitcoin standard for them it
[06:04] inflation is already your friend and not
[06:07] your enemy like it's it's it's it's
[06:09] crazy when we now adopting a Bitcoin
[06:11] standard because I want to talk later
[06:14] with you about that 25 division um but
[06:17] you can uh put the 25th division already
[06:21] on your live right now and go on a
[06:23] Bitcoin
[06:24] standard and if you move to certain
[06:26] parts of the world maybe you can
[06:28] actually live in in a in a coin standard
[06:31] paying for things like Switzerland or
[06:33] Lugano or something like that um but
[06:36] it's already possible and it's it's
[06:38] fascinating to see uh that uh the the
[06:42] rest of the world will be so Left Behind
[06:46] of all the possible um uh purchasing
[06:49] power gains they could make if they
[06:52] factor in the the the financial system
[06:55] their own Financial standard would be
[06:58] Bitcoin and then maybe use like tools
[07:00] like Ai and and something like to
[07:02] enhance the productivity that's like a
[07:04] seems like a cheat code I know and and
[07:07] uh
[07:08] it's I think it's GNA it's G to uh
[07:12] enable some productivity growth in uh
[07:16] places where westerners are going to
[07:19] consider it quite unexpected even though
[07:22] it really shouldn't be unexpected I
[07:24] think we're going to get some insane
[07:26] productivity growth coming out of Africa
[07:29] southeast Asia um South
[07:33] America uh because people there like you
[07:36] said you don't have to wait for your
[07:38] government you just do it uh you can get
[07:40] on a Bitcoin standard for most of your
[07:42] store
[07:43] value uh you don't have to do it for all
[07:45] your monetary needs I mean I you know
[07:49] there money does different things and
[07:51] you know some people are
[07:53] very they very dead set on a type of
[07:56] money doing all the money things right
[07:58] it has to do the medium of exchange bit
[08:00] the store value bit and the unit of
[08:02] account bit and I I just I I'm I don't
[08:05] think like that uh I I think there's
[08:08] money to many different types of goods
[08:11] and different types of goods can fulfill
[08:13] different roles that uh a money uh
[08:16] should do and and so I you know I've
[08:19] never been anywhere in the world where
[08:20] I've had any problem paying for anything
[08:22] like a small thing like at the corner
[08:24] shop or whatever everyone has some like
[08:26] crappy field money to do that that's not
[08:28] a problem for people it's saving money
[08:32] and building Capital over time without
[08:34] having it stolen from you by the
[08:35] government that's the problem that's
[08:37] what what's holding a lot of these
[08:38] people back um now that they have access
[08:41] to computers they have access to AI it's
[08:44] not that expensive and they can get on
[08:46] you know a hard money standard it's like
[08:49] Nik y said he was like okay imagine the
[08:51] whole world on like deuts Mark and I I
[08:55] mean I'm I'm stealing that that that's a
[08:57] brilliant way of thinking about it um I
[08:59] I think you know a lot of these areas
[09:02] are just going to Leap Frog they're just
[09:04] going to go you know they're they're not
[09:07] even going to care what the government
[09:08] says they're just going to go uh use the
[09:11] hardest money that they can for saving
[09:14] uh and it's going to impact them
[09:15] positively and other people can't help
[09:18] but be impacted by that as well so I I
[09:22] think that's a trend that we're going to
[09:24] see we're going to see tremendous growth
[09:27] uh especially in proportional terms come
[09:29] out of uh Emerging Markets from this
[09:32] Digital Services software production
[09:35] these types of things like you can do
[09:37] that anywhere uh you know now with with
[09:40] the help of these like AI agents you can
[09:44] get so much more work done as a single
[09:46] person and if you can get paid and you
[09:48] can save that's like a tremendous
[09:51] opportunity for raising living standards
[09:54] in a lot of places I think it's going to
[09:57] happen absolutely it's it's fascinating
[09:59] to even think about that and this also
[10:02] like my my first actual topic that I
[10:04] want to discuss with you today um when
[10:07] we already see now the the the trend
[10:09] towards Bitcoin and Trend towards those
[10:12] uh those things um how and we will speak
[10:16] in in a few days probably like really
[10:19] close to to when I publish that will be
[10:21] Bitcoin Amsterdam where we we are on on
[10:23] stage with prom and Evan uh talking
[10:26] about a hyper bitcon ised World in in
[10:29] 2050 and how life in 2050 uh in that
[10:33] Bitcoin world uh would be and what
[10:36] things would change and we already
[10:37] talked before how how difficult that
[10:40] topic and that question is because it
[10:42] looks out 26 years uh it's like looking
[10:46] back at the internet when it's 1998 and
[10:48] you want to predict what's happening in
[10:50] 2024 um but uh let's try to do our best
[10:54] job anyways um how do you imagine that
[10:58] Bitcoin world if Bitcoin under the
[11:01] presumption that Bitcoin is actually
[11:03] successful and it goes how we want it to
[11:05] go uh in 2050 first of all like how do
[11:08] you think look does that look like for
[11:10] you and then how does the world look
[11:12] like if if Bitcoin is successful I mean
[11:14] if Bitcoin is properly successful I
[11:16] think it can dramatically change the
[11:18] world in a lot of ways it can be as
[11:22] profound as like you know think about
[11:25] how profound remote working is and just
[11:27] the fact that you and me are sitting
[11:29] here here in a digital Studio over the
[11:30] Internet like doing TV stuff with you
[11:34] know I have like a 500 lb setup here and
[11:37] you know you probably have something
[11:39] similar and we're doing stuff that is
[11:43] not far from equivalent and quality to
[11:45] what a like you know million dooll TV
[11:49] studio would get you 30 years ago uh or
[11:53] even 20 years ago I mean actually our
[11:55] camera quality is probably higher than
[11:57] what they had um so I I just think
[12:01] the
[12:03] the the possibility of profound change
[12:07] uh to to a point that is hard to
[12:08] comprehend uh could happen uh I mean we
[12:12] could we could start if if we start like
[12:15] from the top um so I'm I'm very much of
[12:20] the um of the sovereign individual
[12:23] school where I think that uh changes in
[12:27] technology Drive Mega political EV and
[12:29] you know safe talks a lot about this
[12:31] when he says something to the tune of um
[12:35] you can choose not to use gunpowder but
[12:37] you can't choose to insulate yourself
[12:40] from the effects on you of other people
[12:44] using gunpowder and so I I think Bitcoin
[12:48] is very similar to that in in that it
[12:51] you you have to use it um at a certain
[12:55] point because if you don't you're going
[12:57] to fall so far behind that that life
[13:00] just becomes like untenable and so the
[13:02] there comes there comes kind of like a
[13:04] tipping point where everyone has to
[13:06] start thinking very seriously about this
[13:08] and doing it and so the the
[13:11] largest the the biggest effect that I
[13:14] think this is going to have is that if
[13:17] you if you look at it from the largest
[13:19] possible picture um the biggest thing
[13:21] that Bitcoin does is that it tilts uh
[13:25] return on investment from aggression
[13:27] back so today uh aggression is fairly
[13:32] well rewarded uh you can view this in
[13:35] another way it's like the balance
[13:37] between offensive and defensive
[13:39] Technologies right so if you go back to
[13:42] uh if you perfect example from the
[13:43] sovereign individual is how the
[13:46] political situation of Europe changed
[13:49] once City walls were
[13:51] invented so before this point uh rating
[13:55] was quite profitable you know you you
[13:57] created a rating party
[13:59] you took Somebody by surprise you like
[14:02] raided and looted their city and you
[14:04] made a bunch of money then City walls
[14:06] and and so in that type of environment
[14:09] there's there are only a few type of
[14:12] political structures that kind of make
[14:15] sense uh normally you know you have a
[14:17] very like top down um structure normally
[14:21] driven by Warlords or you know people
[14:25] who are like the warrior type uh they're
[14:27] they're going to like protect you or
[14:29] help you raid or do something like this
[14:33] then on on onto the scene comes the uh
[14:36] the technology of building City
[14:38] walls and what happens well the balance
[14:42] of power shifts back in favor of the
[14:44] defender again and
[14:46] so no longer is it that attractive to
[14:49] loot and so the whole political scene
[14:53] especially in the southern Mediterranean
[14:55] changes and so City you know city state
[14:59] pop up you get these like polies all of
[15:02] a sudden inside of the city wall it
[15:04] makes a lot more sense to trade and
[15:06] build and create things than it than it
[15:08] does to go and you know pillage and
[15:11] steal by force and you know humans are
[15:14] all about incentives if it's more
[15:16] profitable to go and take other people's
[15:18] stuff by force then some people are
[15:20] going to do that a lot of people are
[15:21] going to do that if it's more profitable
[15:25] to build things and create and trade
[15:28] peacefully
[15:29] uh because the return on investment and
[15:31] violence is low then you get
[15:34] civilization you get like complex
[15:36] societal structures you get
[15:37] specialization in the economy you know
[15:40] you get productivity growth you you
[15:42] basically you get what modern society is
[15:47] built on which is we're actually pretty
[15:50] efficient at doing different things
[15:51] because we can specialize you know not
[15:53] everyone has to be a warrior to protect
[15:55] their family uh we we can have some
[15:57] reasonable assurance that we're not
[15:59] going to be like just looted out of our
[16:01] possessions at any given point and so
[16:03] one of the main things that I think
[16:05] Bitcoin does is that it tilts um it
[16:07] tilts the opportunity or it tilts the
[16:10] advantage back towards defense again uh
[16:13] Bitcoin is very defensible it's easy to
[16:16] protect it's hard to
[16:18] steal and I think this in general um
[16:22] makes
[16:23] looting that type of uh of life just
[16:27] less interesting less profitable the
[16:30] return on investment for violence goes
[16:32] down and so I think we're going to have
[16:34] a less violent Society less violent
[16:36] Society normally tends to mean greater
[16:39] things um
[16:41] civilization uh you know it it it
[16:44] literally lowers people's time
[16:45] preference literally uh when when when
[16:48] you can be reasonably assured that no
[16:50] one's going to come take your stuff you
[16:52] think further ahead uh you have the
[16:53] ability to you know uncertainty is one
[16:57] of the key negative influences on
[17:00] civilization if you have a level of
[17:03] uncertainty that is prohibitive to do
[17:05] longterm stuff then long-term stuff just
[17:08] isn't done and then nothing's really
[17:11] that nice so I think that's like the
[17:13] biggest effect um the the second largest
[17:17] effect is that the existence of Bitcoin
[17:20] kind of forces fiscal responsibility on
[17:23] on everyone uh but States in particular
[17:26] uh because they've previously had the
[17:28] privilege to you know print money as
[17:30] they choose and the citizenry has to
[17:33] pick up the bill uh if the citizenry has
[17:36] access to bitcoin that is you're just
[17:39] limiting the set of people who you can
[17:41] steal from because you can only really
[17:43] steal from people who don't have Bitcoin
[17:45] because otherwise Bitcoin just reprices
[17:47] to reflect a new uh amount of money uh
[17:51] in in the trading pair that you just
[17:53] inflated so when you can't do that um
[17:57] that too I think really diminishes the
[18:00] return on on violence it just becomes
[18:03] very expensive to maintain these
[18:06] gigantic militaries that go around and
[18:09] you know loot resources on massive
[18:13] scales you know think like Iraq Libya
[18:16] you know these types of operations where
[18:18] they just go in and you know take over
[18:21] the whole like commodity production
[18:22] resource base of like a giant country I
[18:25] just think this will become harder and
[18:26] harder uh because you literally have to
[18:29] go to the citizenry and say Hey I want
[18:32] to build you know like a giant army to
[18:35] go steal the stuff like guys's going to
[18:38] be okay with some more taxes and
[18:40] everyone's say no definitely not we
[18:44] don't want to do that like can't we all
[18:47] be friends um and so you know that I I
[18:50] think it's going to make it basically
[18:53] makes Empires less profitable and so I
[18:56] think states are going to shrink think
[18:58] you might see the breakup of some of the
[19:00] like very very large uh super
[19:04] Multicultural countries with low social
[19:07] cohesion um and so I think you're
[19:09] actually going to have a lot more
[19:10] countries by 20150 that's that's one of
[19:13] my I I personally think and hope that we
[19:17] will uh return towards something that's
[19:21] mo more closely like Medieval Europe
[19:23] with uh lots of independent polities
[19:27] lots of smaller independent states that
[19:29] band together in
[19:30] federations uh and federations are some
[19:33] of the most uh resilient political
[19:35] structures over time as well some of the
[19:37] oldest countries in the world are
[19:38] federations and so those are like the
[19:41] large the very very like large scale
[19:44] things that I see I see less war smaller
[19:48] countries uh less military more fiscal
[19:51] responsibility and more long-term
[19:53] thinking and so I think we're going to
[19:55] build cooler stuff bigger stuff cooler
[19:57] stuff prettier stuff this whole Bitcoin
[20:00] or Obsession about architecture is is
[20:02] absolutely um I think it's
[20:06] true I I think once we are forced into
[20:10] or not forced into once we are uh given
[20:13] the ability again to think longer term
[20:16] um I think we're going to return to
[20:18] building nicer stuff and I actually
[20:21] can't wait for that um so drab
[20:25] lately absolutely i i l it a lot and
[20:28] kind of the summary of that for me what
[20:30] I took away is like it Bitcoin gives you
[20:33] the incentive to provide value and not
[20:37] to cheat yeah uh and in that is it
[20:42] disincentivizes uh not to cheat not to
[20:44] steal from someone else not to to burn
[20:47] other buildings St but to build a really
[20:49] nice building yourself uh and to to make
[20:53] uh things better and also like a little
[20:55] bit of a return to Quality a return to
[20:58] uh those uh low time preference things
[21:01] which uh I think if if that's that's the
[21:04] outcome of Bitcoin that alone has such
[21:07] an positive effect on everyone even if
[21:11] he doesn't own Bitcoin that that's the
[21:13] main thing it makes the world better
[21:15] even for the people to don't who don't
[21:17] earn bit own Bitcoin even though they
[21:20] should own Bitcoin uh but but that
[21:23] that's a that's a big thing I feel like
[21:26] yeah I I totally agree and
[21:29] I the I I just wish everybody would have
[21:34] some because I I do think I don't think
[21:38] um Fiat monies are going away anytime
[21:42] soon I think they're going to keep at it
[21:45] for as long as they possibly can if if
[21:47] if you're not protecting yourself will
[21:50] be they will squeeze you until the end
[21:54] they will sque squeeze you until there's
[21:55] nothing more to squeeze so I you know I
[21:58] obviously prefer if uh if more people
[22:02] would start I mean like like you said
[22:05] you don't have to wait you can just do
[22:07] it now um yes you're going to have to
[22:10] tolerate some volatility is volatility
[22:13] worse than just having a constant hand
[22:17] in your pocket taking out your money um
[22:20] in a compounding way that's another
[22:23] thing that I don't think people like
[22:24] fully appreciate that the theft that
[22:28] comes from inflation compounds and so
[22:31] the amount of money that has been stolen
[22:33] from you at the at the midpoint or the
[22:37] end of your career starts just becoming
[22:40] absolutely
[22:41] stupendous um and the the amount of
[22:44] wealth even the mo like the regular
[22:48] person could have the amount of
[22:50] additional wealth a regular person could
[22:52] have it's just crazy one thing that you
[22:55] quickly uh like briefly mentioned before
[22:59] is taxes uh once we don't have a money
[23:03] printer at the state and the nation
[23:05] states or whatever the jurisdictional
[23:07] form that uh people will uh gather
[23:11] themselves in in in 2050 um they
[23:15] actually have to ask the citizens for
[23:19] the money so they have to uh can only
[23:23] spend the money that they actually have
[23:25] because there is no money print that can
[23:27] just be turned on if there is a
[23:31] emergency uh uh which
[23:34] is seemingly every few years an
[23:37] emergency to print money and even in
[23:39] between we print a little bit of money
[23:41] so uh there's always an excuse for
[23:43] printing money what happens if that
[23:45] possibility is no longer there and they
[23:48] have to ask for taxes for everything are
[23:51] we switching to a service-based uh model
[23:54] is like the the vision of the sovereign
[23:57] individual uh then already in play in
[23:59] 2050 or is that too quick I think some
[24:02] places uh I I think there will just be
[24:04] more Choice which I think what what
[24:06] Freedom fundamentally is is choice just
[24:09] the ability to choose yourself uh
[24:11] without somebody else imposing choices
[24:13] on you uh so I think we will have more
[24:15] freedom and more choice I don't think
[24:18] governments are going to go away I think
[24:20] the model of the welfare state is
[24:22] actually quite popular uh and I think a
[24:24] lot of people want that um and uh I I
[24:28] think having that if you agree to it and
[24:32] you think it's fine I don't see a
[24:34] problem I mean it's uh it's probably not
[24:37] the most efficient way to to generate
[24:40] wealth um but so long as we
[24:44] have so long as people are actually free
[24:46] to move about and choose uh and vote
[24:50] with their feet if you will for which
[24:52] system they want to be a part of and so
[24:54] long as it's clear to everyone which
[24:59] systems which political systems deliver
[25:01] the most the highest standard of life to
[25:04] people um and and moving costs are low
[25:07] switching costs are low um I I think we
[25:10] will arrive naturally at um where where
[25:14] we're going to be I think some places
[25:15] are going to be just like we have now
[25:17] some places are going to be higher tax
[25:19] some places are going to be lower tax
[25:22] it's just it's going to depend on a ton
[25:23] of factors I don't I don't foresee a ton
[25:25] of
[25:26] difference there I think I mean what I
[25:29] what I first hope for is a change in the
[25:32] conversation and I think that probably
[25:34] will happen because obviously inflation
[25:37] uh inflation taxes are
[25:40] undemocratic uh because we don't get to
[25:42] choose when they're uh put on us and
[25:44] most people don't even know that that's
[25:46] what that is they just see the prices go
[25:48] up and they think that's like the way
[25:50] it's has to be they don't even know that
[25:53] they're being taxed um and it's not even
[25:55] like all that tax is going to the
[25:56] government uh a lot of the inflation tax
[26:00] if you will on regular people are just
[26:01] going to large private entities who can
[26:03] take out the most debt the first thing I
[26:05] would want and I do think we're going to
[26:06] get this increasingly on a Bitcoin
[26:08] standard is that there's going to be a
[26:10] change in conversation and hopefully a
[26:11] more higher awareness among regular
[26:14] people like what is actually happening
[26:17] uh and why their prices just always go
[26:21] up like why is that uh I mean if you
[26:23] asked a person that question 10 years
[26:26] ago probably 99 out of 100 would have no
[26:29] idea they just would have absolutely no
[26:32] no idea why why that's taking place if
[26:34] you ask now I think there's like a
[26:36] growing awareness maybe uh only 90 out
[26:40] of 100 will be unable to tell you and
[26:41] maybe 10 people will actually be able to
[26:43] tell you I mean that's that's quite a
[26:46] growth in um in awareness and and this
[26:50] type of aware of awareness I think is
[26:51] just driven on by the existence of
[26:55] Bitcoin and the fact that it works and
[26:58] and what I think will become very hard
[27:01] to ignore evidence over time which is
[27:03] that countries that adopt the Bitcoin
[27:05] standard should do better um and I think
[27:08] people are going to have a really hard
[27:09] time denying that it it's just going to
[27:12] be obvious and so that that I think is
[27:14] going to lead to more competition I
[27:17] think you'll have more and more
[27:18] countries especially small countries uh
[27:21] doing Bitcoin standard stuff doing like
[27:23] lower taxes uh you know trying to trying
[27:27] to uh get growth be the primary like
[27:31] motor of their economy and just like
[27:33] have their their prosperity come from
[27:36] the you know regular people's ability to
[27:38] actually build Capital
[27:41] so yeah I I don't
[27:44] like I I do think we we will end up at a
[27:47] point where you might have Sovereign
[27:50] individuals uh for sure because some
[27:53] some states are going to become
[27:55] service-based um I mean it's all almost
[27:58] already like that in some places so I
[28:01] don't see why that wouldn't become more
[28:03] prevalent um and then you have these
[28:05] like package deal it's it's like what do
[28:08] you want do you want an all-inclusive
[28:10] State like do you want all you're
[28:13] all-inclusive like or or or do you want
[28:15] to like pick and choose and like some
[28:17] people are holiday people and they like
[28:20] the all-inclusive stuff uh other people
[28:23] are the traveler type and they're like
[28:25] nah I'll I'll I'll pick and choose my
[28:27] own thing I you know to me the most
[28:29] important thing is that there's choice I
[28:31] don't think like I don't think one
[28:34] solution is good for everyone for some
[28:36] people the all-inclusive like welfare
[28:38] state model is probably really good uh
[28:41] and so long as they can attract enough
[28:44] people uh of the higher productivity
[28:47] type to kind of like help along the ones
[28:50] that are of the lower productivity type
[28:52] then should be okay know but but but but
[28:56] well is that sustainable I don't know
[28:58] I I really don't know uh because if if
[29:01] you get to a point where all the
[29:02] productive people pick up and and go
[29:05] where their service provision is the
[29:08] best then that's going to be a real
[29:09] problem for welfare
[29:12] states it would be a a game fever event
[29:15] where basically the countries are kind
[29:19] of forced to make themselves smaller and
[29:23] more service based in the long run
[29:25] anyways it's a really interesting f if
[29:28] if Bitcoin prevails how how nation
[29:31] states and and those borders and those
[29:34] all those laws that are now into place
[29:36] actually come into place also one thing
[29:39] that I really want to get into a little
[29:40] bit with you is the awareness for
[29:43] inflation as you said like uh there are
[29:45] more and more there's more and more
[29:47] awareness for inflation I have no clue
[29:49] how it was like 10 15 years ago uh
[29:53] because it was just not a topic back
[29:54] then and I was like 12 years old uh but
[29:59] uh uh now I see that the inflation topic
[30:03] is in everyone's mind like people
[30:05] actually talk about inflation when I sit
[30:08] on a train and I listen to a
[30:09] conversation like a few rows in front of
[30:12] me or I'm at the restaurant and as over
[30:14] here other tables like inflation that
[30:17] things are getting more expensive that's
[30:19] an topic it's also a political topic
[30:22] because uh we had yesterday uh national
[30:25] election in Austria it was a big big
[30:27] topic also there so it's 100% a topic
[30:31] and that probably was 10 years ago not
[30:33] true but interesting enough I never hear
[30:36] a real reason for inflation like when I
[30:39] when I when I hear people talking about
[30:41] it when you hear mainstream Medias
[30:43] politic political uh people but also on
[30:46] the streets on on buses or something
[30:48] like that you hear greedy immigra greedy
[30:50] corporations immigrants you hear War you
[30:54] you remember do you remember that one
[30:55] article where they blamed Beyonce for
[30:58] for inflation yeah yeah it was yeah I
[31:01] mean it's it's partly by Design right um
[31:05] there are there are definitely some
[31:07] people who who have very vested interest
[31:09] in aisc here
[31:11] but I think a lot of the rest of it is
[31:15] just
[31:17] incentives um I just don't think
[31:20] Academia really is incentivized to
[31:24] figure out why this is true people still
[31:26] have this like knee-jerk Trust ofu like
[31:28] experts or whatever so if like some
[31:30] Professor goes on the television and
[31:33] says oh we don't really know what's
[31:34] causing inflation and everyone's like
[31:36] well I guess it's a mystery then
[31:38] right no and I I think a lot of people
[31:42] don't have
[31:43] the they just don't have the the
[31:46] confidence in themselves to believe that
[31:49] they're actually capable of figuring
[31:51] this out and it's not even that
[31:54] complicated uh but because they just
[31:57] assume that well it's a very complex and
[31:59] intricate topic and like if this
[32:01] professor guy can't figure it out that I
[32:02] mean I stent no chance and I might not
[32:04] even try uh and it's not common uh like
[32:10] the
[32:11] the the writers that they need to read
[32:15] uh the the kind of Economics thinkers
[32:18] that have known this for hundreds of
[32:21] years are just not that commonly known
[32:25] uh they're they're very
[32:28] rarely uh made curriculum in uh
[32:31] economics education I mean I know a
[32:33] bunch of people who have gone to school
[32:35] for economics and I mean a lot of them
[32:38] are like you know we not not only did we
[32:41] not learn the correct stuff they taught
[32:44] us their wrong stuff and so it's just
[32:47] you know it's it's difficult I just
[32:49] think it's it's difficult for people to
[32:51] get you know I think a lot of people are
[32:53] trying I think the media are trying
[32:54] they're just not capable uh I mean and
[32:57] it's hard being the media like think
[32:58] about all the stuff you got to be an
[33:00] expert in to like deliver like good me
[33:03] like good journalism and and there are
[33:05] so few of them now you know back in the
[33:07] day like a newspaper would have you know
[33:10] a ton of journalists now they have like
[33:12] a small handful and they all have to be
[33:13] experts on like 12 different things and
[33:15] so nothing they do is particularly good
[33:17] and then you know people are just not
[33:20] well informed uh and you know I I think
[33:24] I I honestly like what you're doing is a
[33:26] is a reaction to this right it's like
[33:28] you how do we how do we get like the
[33:31] real information to people and and the
[33:33] democratization of of information
[33:35] creation and uh and media I think is is
[33:39] going to be hugely positive here it's
[33:41] like we literally need to go uh there
[33:44] are enough people who know how this
[33:46] works like it's not that hard uh but
[33:49] yeah we we just need to get the
[33:51] information out there um and and you
[33:55] know once you see it it's obvious it's
[33:57] like well okay you changed a denominator
[33:59] then yeah the price changes I mean
[34:03] obviously um but you know people even
[34:07] the word itself like if you think about
[34:10] how well OB fiscated this is you know
[34:12] and I don't know if it's on purpose
[34:14] entirely or not but if you think about
[34:15] how well obfuscated it is inflation
[34:18] right now uh doesn't mean the increase
[34:23] of the money supply uh the way the way
[34:25] it used to like that that used to be
[34:28] what that word meant it's like think
[34:30] about the word you inflate something
[34:31] what are you inflating you're inflating
[34:33] the amount of money like that is how the
[34:35] the word used to be uh that was the
[34:38] semantic content of the word now
[34:40] inflation means the
[34:43] CPI like the Consumer Price Index that
[34:46] is what inflation is now so it's hard to
[34:49] even have a good conversation about this
[34:51] because before you have a good
[34:52] conversation you have to sit down and
[34:54] like you have to agree on terms it's
[34:56] like okay when we say now what is it
[34:58] that we mean do we mean the the increase
[35:00] in the in the basket of goods the price
[35:03] increase is that what you mean by
[35:04] inflation like why is that going up well
[35:07] it's because of
[35:09] inflation and and then they're like yeah
[35:11] but sometimes they print money and
[35:12] prices don't go up and then you really
[35:14] have to go there you know you have to
[35:16] talk about productivity increases and
[35:18] natural deflation and like free markets
[35:20] and all this stuff and then a lot of
[35:22] them will dismiss you because they'll oh
[35:24] that's right Wingery right there you
[35:26] know n this is right-wing stuff and we
[35:29] don't want to hear that uh so a lot of
[35:32] conversations just die right there as
[35:34] well I mean and and if you don't want to
[35:35] know then you don't want to know and the
[35:38] other thing about modern politics is
[35:40] that if something can be really really
[35:43] vague you know everybody likes a
[35:46] boogeyman or an enemy in modern politics
[35:48] and if you can make inflation your enemy
[35:50] but you can make inflation so difficult
[35:53] to pin down that nobody knows what it is
[35:57] or how it exists then you can use that
[36:00] politically to do a lot of stuff right
[36:02] because you can be like uh I'm going to
[36:04] do this and it's going to it's going to
[36:06] lower inflation right and then people
[36:09] are going to be like okay y you know
[36:13] that's probably true like look at the
[36:15] the US inflation reduction act you know
[36:19] they're like we're going to print a ton
[36:20] of money and we're going to use it to
[36:22] lower
[36:24] inflation and people just went like yeah
[36:27] yes that is exactly what we need right
[36:29] now and it says in the bill the bill is
[36:31] named the inflation reduction act so
[36:33] that's obviously what they're going for
[36:35] and listen inflation is so hard anyway
[36:37] and so complicated no one even knows
[36:39] where it comes from but these guys like
[36:40] they probably know what they're doing
[36:42] and they really want our they have our
[36:44] best in mind so like here's where we're
[36:46] going to take that so it's really
[36:47] politically useful too for this to be
[36:50] poorly defined not really like dealt
[36:54] with in the the the depth that you kind
[36:57] of expect from public officials like
[37:00] they don't want that they that's that
[37:01] doesn't help them they need something to
[37:04] be like I am for this and I'm G to get
[37:06] your prices down and I'm going to do it
[37:08] by implementing my political ideology
[37:11] and that's going to work I'm gon to I'm
[37:14] going to do rent control or like price
[37:16] fixing or whatever it is because that is
[37:19] what you want to hear because you are
[37:21] left leaning person and so that's going
[37:23] to get me reelected and I'm going to
[37:25] 100% do that and it's going to work and
[37:28] when it doesn't you're going to be like
[37:30] okay but that wasn't my fault and if you
[37:33] just elect me again they'll work next
[37:36] time right and this is like how they go
[37:39] this is how it goes over and over and
[37:41] over so uh yeah the the public
[37:44] conversation so you know just back to
[37:47] the original point I think the public
[37:49] conversation is getting a little bit
[37:50] better uh because like you said 10 years
[37:52] ago yeah you maybe you're too young I
[37:54] still remember uh people sort of talked
[37:57] about it but not really because
[37:58] inflation wasn't that bad even after all
[38:00] that money was printed in the wake of
[38:02] the great financial crisis and the Euro
[38:04] crisis and all that then inflation never
[38:06] really hit and honestly that did a lot
[38:09] of damage to the uh money printing
[38:13] creates inflation narrative which is
[38:14] quite interesting too so I I think a lot
[38:17] of people looked at that and they were
[38:18] like yeah but they printed all this
[38:19] money back then and look that didn't
[38:21] create any
[38:22] inflation right but then it's the Jeff
[38:24] boo thing it's like yeah measured
[38:27] against what though measured against
[38:29] like the productivity growth uh you know
[38:32] yeah prices didn't go up but it's
[38:34] because we actually were in the middle
[38:35] of the it Revolution and we were in the
[38:38] middle of the Outsourcing everything to
[38:40] China wave so everything got cheaper
[38:43] right but instead of everything getting
[38:44] cheaper it just stayed around zero and
[38:48] all that money printing went to the
[38:51] governments and to the uh you know the
[38:55] the large corporations and the large in
[38:57] ution is able to take on uh you know
[39:00] increasing amount of debts
[39:02] so yeah it's it's getting better I would
[39:05] say it's getting better like at least
[39:07] now we're talking about it again
[39:08] obviously it's sad because everybody had
[39:10] to get like wrecked for that to happen
[39:13] but the conversation is now back on the
[39:14] table uh and I there are more people now
[39:18] be partly because of Bitcoin there are
[39:20] more people now who actually understand
[39:24] what's going on here and they're like oh
[39:26] yeah because we're printing a of money
[39:27] it's obvious right that was not the case
[39:30] even 10 years ago like at all it was
[39:33] only gold bugs who talked about that and
[39:34] they were seen as totally crazy if you
[39:38] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[39:40] regular basis I'll guess you already
[39:42] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[39:45] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[39:48] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[39:50] personal recommendation for harder
[39:52] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[39:55] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[39:57] a gift for a friend who has still the
[39:59] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[40:02] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[40:05] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[40:10] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[40:12] to really level up your sovereignty as
[40:15] an individual you have to have the most
[40:17] secure self custody setup you have to
[40:20] secure your own devices you have to
[40:23] protect your privacy you have to set up
[40:26] an inheritance plan and depending on
[40:28] where you live you even want to have a
[40:31] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[40:33] in case something goes really really
[40:35] wrong and through all those steps the

[40:52] and last but not least I have something
[40:54] completely new for you guys I partnered
[40:58] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[41:01] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[41:04] saw created by anyone look at that
[41:07] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[41:10] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[41:13] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[41:16] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[41:18] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[41:22] make sure to check out the link in the
[41:24] description for this amazing coin
[41:26] vigilante n Pieces those watches are
[41:29] amazing I love them so much it was
[41:30] really hard for me to pick the one that
[41:33] I want to have because there are a lot
[41:34] of great options I went with the new
[41:37] transparency Edition they're all limited
[41:40] so grab yours those will not be
[41:43] available for a long time but there will
[41:45] come new models and new amazing designs
[41:48] along the way that's so interesting uh
[41:51] like I love that point like there's U by
[41:53] the way a lot of things that that I want
[41:55] to unpack here um
[41:57] uh the one thing that came up in my mind
[42:00] is also like when when you hear the the
[42:02] mainstream media and some some news
[42:04] articles where like oh yeah Bitcoin
[42:07] failed as an inflation hatch because
[42:09] there was like 5% inflation and then one
[42:11] month and in that very month Bitcoin
[42:14] went down like 1% but that's obviously
[42:17] like that's proof that that Bitcoin
[42:19] failed as an inflation H and I'm like
[42:22] really is is that that the level we are
[42:26] at right now and and it's fascinating
[42:28] for me uh uh when when we think about
[42:32] Bitcoin as an inflation hatch because it
[42:34] absolutely is but people zoom in too
[42:36] much and I have one amazing graphic that
[42:41] discovered not that long ago and you
[42:44] probably know that I will just like
[42:45] share it quickly because I heard it it
[42:48] was so so such an amazing uh graphic uh
[42:53] let me quickly bring it up and let me
[42:57] get your thoughts on it that is uh do
[43:00] you see it yeah you see it that is the
[43:03] four four year simple moving average of
[43:05] the Bitcoin price yeah yeah and and
[43:07] that's on a and that's on on a linear
[43:10] scale yeah and and and that's the that's
[43:13] the thing where I'm like um the only
[43:16] thing you have to do with Bitcoin is
[43:19] moving out of your you too zoomed in you
[43:23] are too fixated on like a daily move or
[43:26] like even a monthly move or something
[43:28] like that and just like Focus long term
[43:31] uh know that that is an inflation hge
[43:34] but not for tomorrow like if tomorrow
[43:38] your uh I don't know banana is five
[43:41] cents higher that doesn't mean that
[43:43] Bitcoin could not go down like that that
[43:45] does that's not a thing like inflation
[43:47] is a very but it it is in in in general
[43:51] terms a quite complicated process where
[43:54] when they print a bunch of money it's
[43:56] not not like it all uh comes directly
[44:00] into the economy it mean it needs some
[44:03] time so there's some lag uh in there and
[44:06] also for the inflation hge of of Bitcoin
[44:09] H it's such a
[44:11] small um asset right now compared to
[44:14] like gold real estate and all the other
[44:16] markets where uh it's not only an
[44:19] inflation hch but it's also a fast
[44:21] growing uh Tech startup in in a way
[44:25] because it's still so small uh and I
[44:27] think that's a lot of the confusion uh
[44:30] is where a lot of the confusion is
[44:32] coming from and I just wanted to bring
[44:34] this up because I think it it suits very
[44:36] nicely to to the conversation totally
[44:38] and but but you know so just a start
[44:41] people are very bad at thinking long
[44:43] term just in general and this is this is
[44:45] a part of a result of the of the Fiat
[44:48] mindset but but you know the other thing
[44:50] too is that uh yeah money printing
[44:53] doesn't necessarily have to create
[44:55] inflation there and then it depends on
[44:56] like where the money is going so 2008 is
[44:59] like a perfect example like the money
[45:02] was already in that had already caused
[45:05] the inflation at that point right
[45:08] because all of these like balance sheets
[45:12] had been tapped already that money had
[45:14] gone out as bonuses and as you know
[45:18] salaries and as like that had been
[45:21] extracted already and so all of that you
[45:23] know everything was hollowed out and
[45:25] when when things collapsed and they
[45:27] printed all the money they just
[45:28] reinflated the balance sheet so they
[45:30] just gave back the stuff that had
[45:32] already been taken out and then when
[45:34] people didn't take that back out again
[45:37] immediately yeah of course there was not
[45:39] like that much pressure on the prices um
[45:42] you know that that money was already out
[45:44] uh it it had caused the the the upwards
[45:47] price on uh the upwards pressure on
[45:50] prices in the Years leading up to that
[45:53] point and you could see it the you know
[45:55] the the the stock markets were already
[45:59] you know at like what were considered
[46:01] nose bleeds high at that point and so
[46:04] that that had already happened so it
[46:06] shouldn't be that surprising to people
[46:08] but it but it is because people don't
[46:10] like doing the work but yeah the you
[46:12] know zooming out and and thinking about
[46:15] inflation as a and again it comes back
[46:19] to people don't have the right semantic
[46:24] content to you know bu build into the
[46:27] their understanding of the word
[46:29] inflation like when they think inflation
[46:31] yeah they just think price is going up
[46:33] day to day uh they're not thinking about
[46:36] the long-term effects of monetary
[46:39] debasement and what that does over time
[46:42] on prices because people just aren't
[46:44] very good at zooming out uh everyone's
[46:47] like and and you know everyone's on the
[46:49] Fiat treadmill right like everyone has
[46:51] to constantly just work to keep a flat
[46:55] where's everyone going to get the time
[46:56] to just like sit down and like think
[46:58] deeply about this this is why I I just
[47:01] think Bitcoin comes very naturally to
[47:03] people who are extremely curious and you
[47:07] can't help it you have to read about
[47:09] this stuff it's like you're scratching
[47:11] an itch or something you know uh those
[47:13] people are are the ones that always just
[47:16] get Bitcoin quicker because they're
[47:18] already out there trying
[47:21] to figure out how how the world works
[47:24] you know the you know even if they are
[47:26] in like the Fiat treadmill they just
[47:27] they just can't help it that's just who
[47:29] they are and they have to figure out
[47:30] things how how can we expect everyone to
[47:34] to kind of be at that level I just don't
[47:36] think it's it's it's realistic like even
[47:39] four years is very hard for people I
[47:42] mean I I know a bunch of people who
[47:44] don't even like say for their pension
[47:46] they're just like oh it's going to sort
[47:48] itself out like it's
[47:51] not it won't and then they're like yeah
[47:54] whatever that's like 40 years from now
[47:57] um and that you know I it's it but but
[48:01] it is known though that stress in your
[48:03] in your day-to-day life uh just
[48:05] generates an inability for you to plan
[48:07] for the future uh and and and this is a
[48:10] poverty creating mindset as well you
[48:12] know so and and and Trauma actually does
[48:16] that to people um and so whenever
[48:19] there's a world full of trauma you know
[48:21] there's Wars here and like terrorist
[48:24] attacks there and you know this that and
[48:27] the other is always something you know
[48:29] you spoke earlier about there's always
[48:30] this emergency money money print thing
[48:33] right well yeah if if we if we give
[48:36] governments the ability to print money
[48:38] when there's
[48:40] emergencies they're going to make up
[48:42] emergencies
[48:43] like people work on incentives that I
[48:46] mean it it sounds so like one like on
[48:51] one side it sounds like mundane it's
[48:53] just like well yeah obviously but then
[48:55] on the other side he like no people
[48:57] would never do that like you know
[48:59] they're good people and like this that
[49:01] and the other it's just like
[49:03] incentives you you give someone the
[49:05] incentive to do something someone's
[49:07] going to do it someone's going to do it
[49:09] not everyone's going to do it but like
[49:11] there are all sorts of people that come
[49:13] through government some are good some
[49:14] are bad the bad people are going to do
[49:16] it they're gonna they're absolutely
[49:17] going to do it like you you give them
[49:19] the opportunity to do something that
[49:21] enriches themselves at the expense of
[49:22] everybody else like yeah someone's going
[49:24] to do that 100%
[49:28] yeah it's so clear it's like that in
[49:30] that incentive problem uh is by the way
[49:33] also my main argument always against
[49:36] cbdcs um because a lot of people are
[49:38] like oh you're you're like right wing
[49:40] you you don't like government I'm like
[49:42] no like even if we assume that everyone
[49:45] involved right now with cbdcs is an
[49:49] angel and they really just want the best
[49:51] for everyone uh and uh they they just
[49:54] want to have the best currency and they
[49:56] just really try to build it even if
[49:58] that's true they still install a tool
[50:02] which uh can be programmable be can be
[50:05] abused and it's just a matter of time
[50:07] that the right person comes and will
[50:10] abuse that tool so that that's like if
[50:13] if if we install that tool it will be
[50:15] abused at some point absolutely and you
[50:18] know I I always tell people whenever I
[50:20] hear this argument like I I always say
[50:23] like don't give the government a tool if
[50:25] you wouldn't be happy
[50:27] uh for that tool to be in the hands of
[50:29] Hitler or Stalin like don't give anyone
[50:32] a tool if you wouldn't be happy with
[50:34] those people having that tool don't make
[50:36] the tool don't don't just we don't need
[50:38] that Tool uh and and in the US right now
[50:41] it's just like because a lot of people
[50:43] you know see Trump as as like that level
[50:46] dangerous and I'm just like you know uh
[50:48] so you know your candidate is is in uh
[50:52] is in um Power right now and they want
[50:55] all this like new tools and these Powers
[50:58] I'm like have you literally forgotten
[51:00] what things were like like three years
[51:03] ago like how would you feel with this
[51:05] candidate having that tool kit it's like
[51:09] just don't do it like they don't they
[51:11] don't need the tool if they don't
[51:12] already have the tool there's probably
[51:14] also a good reason for that like why why
[51:17] why why do they need this tool don't
[51:19] give it to them that someone's going to
[51:20] abuse it some bad person is always going
[51:22] to come along you know even just some of
[51:25] the worst people ever were eled you know
[51:28] they don't need the tool but they have
[51:30] to fix inflation and we need cbdcs for
[51:32] inflation
[51:34] fixing right I mean yeah it's
[51:38] unfortunately what they're actually
[51:39] saying like that's that's so um it's sad
[51:42] in in a way but it opens up my one
[51:46] question I had kind of from the
[51:48] beginning uh when we talk about how
[51:50] Bitcoin will look like we have on one
[51:53] side that feat monetary system that is
[51:56] debasing no matter what like I think
[51:58] there's no way around that they will not
[52:00] debase the the rate of debasement and
[52:03] the how fast it will print money it's
[52:06] different but in the end of the day they
[52:09] will find some emergency and they will
[52:11] print money and if even if we find some
[52:14] way where there's 20 years of no
[52:15] emergencies they still will print money
[52:17] and the money will still be debased the
[52:20] currency will still be debased then on
[52:22] the other side we have now Bitcoin and
[52:24] alternative and digital alternative
[52:26] which is really getting with every day
[52:28] better to use easier to use there more
[52:30] on Rams there there's just like so much
[52:33] development right now in Bitcoin where
[52:35] it's like if you're not there a year you
[52:38] feel like you you slept like five years
[52:42] uh which is kind of amazing to see even
[52:43] just like the last year that what this
[52:45] having there was the Bitcoin ETFs there
[52:46] was so much happening um do you see any
[52:50] chance of the the feat monetary system
[52:54] so basically government having their own
[52:55] currency laan long term um surviving if
[52:59] we have that exit W where people can
[53:03] really easily switch there and there's
[53:04] already such a big portion there not a
[53:06] such like it's pretty few people
[53:08] actually there but it's is already for
[53:11] the 15 years on existing quite
[53:13] impressive um do you see any chance no
[53:17] matter the the time frame of it but do
[53:19] you see any chance that fat actually
[53:21] always is there as governments want to
[53:23] have their own tokens they're always
[53:25] going to want to have it right
[53:27] uh so I I think it's it's going to
[53:29] probably be with us for a really long
[53:32] time but uh if if if those field
[53:37] currencies are you know quote unquote
[53:40] backed with like something real like
[53:45] gold or Bitcoin or you know something
[53:47] like that and you know they can still do
[53:50] their whole like legal legal tender
[53:52] enforcement and like this that and the
[53:54] other and like we said ear earlier not
[53:57] everyone cares and if they're fine uh
[54:01] and if they don't see much damage and
[54:03] and if if money
[54:04] printing really really starts slowing
[54:07] down because Bitcoin uh forces fiscal
[54:10] responsibility on governments then Fiat
[54:12] money has become a lot less problematic
[54:14] it just becomes more of like a
[54:15] censorship tool and like that type of
[54:17] stuff um and if it's like super easy to
[54:20] use and you know this that and you have
[54:22] to pay your tax okay maybe it'll be
[54:24] there I don't know long long long term
[54:27] though it just seems pointless like like
[54:31] long long
[54:32] term it's just like why what does it do
[54:36] uh you know is one thing when when when
[54:39] you had to build paper on top of gold
[54:41] because gold was really hard to move um
[54:44] and I mean you can make a you can make
[54:47] an argument that uh government fiat's
[54:50] just going to become a Bitcoin
[54:52] L2 and I mean maybe that's how it goes
[54:56] so so maybe onchain transactions uh are
[54:59] going to get like ridiculously expensive
[55:01] and and heavy uh and it requires like
[55:05] big big economic density to do an
[55:07] onchain settlement maybe uh if that is
[55:11] the case then yeah maybe there's a case
[55:13] for uh government Fiat monies being
[55:16] l2s uh but they have to have reserves
[55:19] and you know you can you can check that
[55:21] and it's got to be auditable and blah
[55:24] blah Maybe
[55:27] um I all I know is that they're going to
[55:30] try for as long as they can to keep that
[55:34] thing going like Bure like bureaucracies
[55:38] are they're like stubborn it's really
[55:42] hard to kill them they're like
[55:44] cockroaches you know they'll they'll
[55:47] find
[55:48] something uh they'll find something for
[55:50] themselves to do uh but yeah like long
[55:53] long term I just like what what like
[55:55] what is the point because like this
[55:57] thing is electronically movable uh and
[55:59] and even if you do uh L2 stuff in a
[56:02] centralized way like I just feel like
[56:05] it' be better for private companies to
[56:08] do the currency Insurance um I just
[56:10] think they're more likely to do it well
[56:12] over time I think Financial censorship
[56:15] is just going to become like untenable
[56:17] anyway um that's like my optimistic
[56:19] scenario is that cryptography just like
[56:22] over time and Technology just makes that
[56:25] can't be
[56:27] like you could try but if people want to
[56:30] it's kind of even like that today like
[56:31] if you really want to you can kind of do
[56:33] whatever you want on the internet uh
[56:35] it's just hard you got to put like it's
[56:37] like a barrier you have to so you know
[56:40] most people aren't even going to do I
[56:42] think most people are honest and you
[56:44] know they're going to pay their taxes
[56:46] they're going to do their thing they're
[56:47] not going to launder money or type of
[56:51] stuff like normal people don't do that
[56:53] unless you'd like tax the crap on
[56:56] and they're just like I don't like this
[56:58] then yeah maybe you force them into
[57:00] something but yeah I long term I just
[57:03] don't see the point in Fiat um like long
[57:07] long term like but I don't I don't know
[57:10] that I'll live to see the end of Fiat
[57:13] money I I think maybe that'll just be
[57:15] with with us for a while um but but not
[57:19] in its current shape form like I just I
[57:21] what I do think is that just Bitcoin
[57:23] takes away their ability to debate
[57:26] willy-nilly they just can't do it
[57:28] because no matter what they do the
[57:30] Bitcoin price just shifts it reflects
[57:33] the new debasement right you know you
[57:35] print 10% more money immediately bitcoin
[57:39] price should change 10% if it's known
[57:42] that you've printed uh and if it's not
[57:44] known then a lot of people are using a
[57:46] money that's not verifiable and I just
[57:48] don't see that happening either because
[57:49] verifiability is so easy in Bitcoin so I
[57:53] just over time people are going to be
[57:54] inherently suspicious of
[57:57] unverifiable uh types of
[57:59] money so yeah I I think they're going to
[58:02] go away long long term but I think
[58:05] they'll be with us for quite some time
[58:06] but yeah they'll probably just
[58:09] tokenize yeah either cbdc or or like
[58:13] functioning yeah could could be could be
[58:16] yeah L2 like a whole another uh
[58:19] discussion I I will not open it as as we
[58:21] already at one hour uh it will will be
[58:24] interesting how we can fit uh three PE
[58:27] like basically four people in the panel
[58:28] in like half an hour that will be
[58:30] probably really G be very hard
[58:33] hard uh I've moderated these things
[58:36] before it's actually really difficult
[58:38] because you know you got to ask like
[58:39] really sharp pointed questions and if
[58:41] you have people like me on who like
[58:42] ramble for like 20 minutes then you got
[58:44] to figure out how to like try to do my
[58:47] best maybe you can give us like a buzzer
[58:50] that we like put in our pocket and when
[58:52] we're rambling you're just go like like
[58:54] a like a cattle prod or like one of
[58:55] those things that you put on your dog so
[58:57] it doesn't go outside an electric
[59:00] shock yeah something like that like okay
[59:03] sorry next
[59:06] person I hope we at least see see our
[59:09] time that that would be that would be
[59:10] fine uh really cool um as we're coming
[59:13] to the end one thing that I really want
[59:15] to get into with you uh you are part as
[59:18] I saw it from coin share uh and coin
[59:21] share is offering a Bitcoin ETP not an
[59:24] ETF which I always was confused what's
[59:26] the difference between an ETP and an ETF
[59:28] first of all like what is the difference
[59:29] and then maybe we can get into because
[59:31] we had this the Bitcoin ETF in the USA
[59:34] some there uh the there's no difference
[59:39] really uh the only difference is that in
[59:41] Europe you can't call it an ETF because
[59:45] in Europe there are specific rules for
[59:47] what can be called an ETF and an ETF
[59:49] needs to be a basket of different assets
[59:53] uh minimum 20% each sorry maximum 20%
[59:57] each so um you you can't make a single
[60:03] asset EF in Europe so it's just called
[60:06] an ETP but it's functionally identical
[60:08] to the to the US ones actually it's a
[60:11] little bit it's a little bit better
[60:13] because uh we do creation and redemption
[60:16] in kind whereas in the US it's done in
[60:19] in cash and so here when we issue
[60:22] certificates uh we get Bitcoin sent to
[60:26] us directly we issue the certificate and
[60:29] then when certificates are redeemed we
[60:32] send the physical Bitcoin and you can
[60:34] it's possible to physically redeem the
[60:37] Bitcoin uh notes that you hold so uh so
[60:41] it's uh it's it's arguably a better
[60:44] structure and we've had it for quite
[60:45] some time we we had the first the first
[60:48] uh Bitcoin ETP uh in Europe uh started
[60:52] in 2015 and it's ours um and uh but that
[60:56] that wasn't structured that way that was
[60:57] structured uh by a swap so it's um it's
[61:01] an inferior structure for the note
[61:03] holder whereas right now when it's
[61:05] physically backed uh there is um like a
[61:10] swap-based ETF is basically a debt
[61:12] instrument it's a claim against the
[61:13] balance sheet of the of the issue now uh
[61:19] there is a a direct link of ownership
[61:22] from the certificate holder down to the
[61:24] Bitcoin at the custodian so even if we
[61:26] go
[61:27] bankrupt uh and cease to exist as a
[61:30] company the note holders uh they don't
[61:32] have any claims against us they actually
[61:35] like own the Bitcoin that is held with
[61:38] custodia so it's just a superior product
[61:41] um there's there's really for most
[61:44] people the the you know who aren't
[61:46] Securities lawyers and who don't care
[61:49] that much about like the very
[61:51] intricacies of the structure of these
[61:52] products they're functionally identical
[61:55] so
[61:56] um and and there are a bunch of them
[61:57] here in Europe and like I said we've had
[61:59] them for a while so um and and they're
[62:02] they're widely accessible uh across
[62:05] European markets they trade on exchanges
[62:07] in Germany and Switzerland and
[62:09] Netherlands and Sweden and I think
[62:11] France and all over the place so wh why
[62:15] do you think the the Bitcoin EDF like
[62:18] there was in Canada one the there was in
[62:20] in Europe there was Bunch all over the
[62:23] world uh Bitcoin ETFs or etps however
[62:26] you call them um and now that we have it
[62:29] in America it kind of like was like oh
[62:31] it's the first Bitcoin ETF but yeah it's
[62:33] just the first in the United States um
[62:36] why is that so meaningful the one in the
[62:39] US or is that just blown over by the
[62:41] Medias and if it was that
[62:44] meaningful uh do you think that the
[62:47] impact of it uh is real and uh will it
[62:50] be um even bigger in in the coming years
[62:55] so
[62:56] it's just because of the size of the US
[62:58] markets and also just so that I don't
[63:00] get perceived as like being an American
[63:02] I'm not uh but but uh because what I'm
[63:07] going to say next is that like in
[63:09] financial markets like really like no
[63:12] one cares that much about Europe it's
[63:14] all about America uh and what America
[63:17] does is what's happening and when when
[63:22] the US green green lit the
[63:26] thing it it signaled uh it signaled an
[63:31] acceptance um in you know among in in
[63:35] the financial Prof profession that I
[63:38] think was extremely much more profound
[63:40] than here because like I said our first
[63:42] product was created in
[63:44] 2015 at that point you know you had a
[63:47] ton of people who never even heard about
[63:49] it right so that so that that happened
[63:52] was not significant in that sense right
[63:55] it was not like a political battle there
[63:57] was no regulator that was like holding
[63:58] out against it or whatever it just
[64:00] happened in Sweden and the swedes were
[64:02] like oh yeah we do this and then that
[64:05] product existed right but in the US it
[64:08] was like a big thing because first of
[64:10] all it took 10 years right I remember
[64:13] back in 2013 when the the Winkle y uh
[64:17] were trying to start the first Bitcoin
[64:19] ETF and that circus went on you know for
[64:22] 10 years uh until it finally got a
[64:25] approved and it was the approval itself
[64:28] and then obviously the the significance
[64:32] proved itself in the flows that came you
[64:36] know the billions of dollars of flows
[64:38] right because America is the 800 pound
[64:40] gorilla in the room like the size of the
[64:43] the markets over there are just enormous
[64:45] and the amount of money that are in
[64:47] there ready for allocation is just
[64:50] gigantic you know we we've spent like a
[64:54] decade uh getting up to an a of 6 and A5
[64:58] billion um and you know what is Black
[65:01] Rock at now after like seven months or
[65:05] whatever there you know just it's just
[65:07] like the scale of things is just so
[65:10] different it's so different um so I
[65:13] think that's probably why the
[65:15] significance is like much more
[65:18] pronounced and and it's you know it was
[65:21] like a big media thing and like all that
[65:23] whereas in Europe it's kind of just like
[65:25] happened organically over time it's just
[65:27] been chug chugging along and the product
[65:29] structure here is great uh and the
[65:31] products are you know they're they're
[65:33] good and they have been good um and and
[65:36] The Regulators here have been you know
[65:39] not always
[65:41] super you know happy but uh they've
[65:44] they've you know it's been a sequential
[65:47] process of you know things happening
[65:50] over time it's uh I I I think we all
[65:54] wish it would happen faster and bigger
[65:56] and everything but it's happening here
[65:59] here as well and you know we're we're
[66:01] we're we're chugging we're chugging
[66:03] along uh you know trying to get those
[66:06] flows
[66:07] so that's um that's just the way things
[66:12] are it's really interesting for me I if
[66:14] feel like the the the biggest impact
[66:18] probably still in in front of us because
[66:20] a lot of a lot of those things are just
[66:22] like getting started uh in the Bitcoin
[66:25] field uh it's Al like big companies then
[66:27] they have the possibilities to do that
[66:29] uh they have like big processes uh of
[66:32] like decision making and those things
[66:34] it's interesting to to see that playing
[66:36] out but yeah there's definitely more
[66:39] more money now coming into Bitcoin than
[66:40] before totally and and uh the American
[66:43] Spirit is a lot more aggressive than in
[66:45] Europe as well um Europe very much has a
[66:48] mindset of uh uh caution wealth
[66:51] protection people here are not always
[66:54] all about like what's going to grow the
[66:58] most and the fastest and the most
[66:59] aggressively there's a lot more thought
[67:01] to what's already what's already there
[67:04] protecting that you know the the
[67:07] American approach is a lot more risk
[67:10] tolerant I think um and so I I just
[67:13] think Americans just have a tendency to
[67:15] be willing to take big risks and
[67:19] Lead um just I'm I'm gonna do this I'm
[67:23] I'm doing it you you all can not do it
[67:27] I'm going to do it I'm going to do it
[67:29] and if if it works out great if not then
[67:32] all right whatever I mean it's not the
[67:34] end of the world uh so I I I think I
[67:38] think there's something going on in
[67:39] Europe that's like repressing the
[67:41] previous uh spirit of uh adventuress and
[67:46] um uh expansion
[67:49] mindset uh because it's certainly not
[67:51] like a historical European thing for
[67:54] sure
[67:55] so there's something going on in the
[67:57] culture here in Europe that makes things
[68:01] um slower yeah I I I feel that too like
[68:05] uh it's different when you look in
[68:07] America to what's what's going on in in
[68:10] Austria and in Europe where where I'm
[68:12] based really cool as we already kind of
[68:15] in the end um of the podcast we have an
[68:18] end routine where we have two questions
[68:19] the one question is always the same for
[68:20] each guest and the question is what can
[68:23] we learn from you besides Bitcoin oh
[68:26] learn from me well I made a lot of
[68:27] mistakes you probably learn from those
[68:32] um uh I don't know I mean I uh I'm
[68:38] interested in a lot of things I don't
[68:40] know how much I have to teach about that
[68:42] though I feel like I'm still learning
[68:44] yeah um that's a really hard question I
[68:48] don't know I'm I'm not sure I'm I'm not
[68:50] sure what people can learn from me other
[68:52] than how to not do a bunch of stuff um
[68:55] but
[68:57] um but um
[69:01] yeah I'm sorry it's I don't know how to
[69:04] answer
[69:05] that that's fine yeah it's interesting I
[69:08] love that question though because um it
[69:11] uh sometimes brings in new things and a
[69:14] lot of people uh actually just say uh
[69:17] yeah a family something related to
[69:20] family or they play some instrument or
[69:23] something like that um uh and something
[69:27] re sometimes really um extra things are
[69:31] coming in I'm like oh interesting I
[69:33] thought with the one thing that comes to
[69:35] my mind is like um Katie from the the um
[69:41] planb BB uh I asked her and she's like
[69:44] oh how to be a mother like I'm a radical
[69:46] mother I feed my kids steak Yeah Yeah
[69:49] and and and she and the kid is still
[69:52] like really a tall like really a baby
[69:55] and
[69:56] so interesting new things uh in their
[70:00] body it's fun my daughter loves steak uh
[70:03] she and and she prefers the fat she just
[70:07] wants to eat the fat she calls it the
[70:09] squishy bit uh which I squishy bit
[70:13] squishy bit but uh I mean I am actually
[70:15] pretty good at making soup I love a good
[70:18] bone broth and uh I I love making broth
[70:23] uh I just love making soup out of Bones
[70:27] I don't know what it is about it but
[70:28] just like uh because I maybe because I
[70:31] have a background in chemistry and so
[70:33] just like making this I I feel like this
[70:35] is my this is my lab work like at home
[70:39] just extracting minerals and protein and
[70:42] stuff from Bones just gives me a weird
[70:48] pleasure so you can make soups out of
[70:51] Bones and Bone yeah interesting never
[70:55] heard bones are the they are the main
[70:58] ingredient of a soup I would say that's
[71:01] like that's the actual soup everything
[71:03] else is just flavoring and like garnish
[71:06] and stuff like it's the bone broth and
[71:09] the collagen and the minerals that you
[71:12] get from the bones that's the real soup
[71:15] everything else is just like to make it
[71:18] a little different oh I never knew that
[71:21] see that that's what I could learn from
[71:22] you today absolutely this is going to re
[71:25] nice you're cooking because once you
[71:27] start making your soup and your sauces
[71:29] and all that with bone broth you're
[71:33] you're you're gonna start really
[71:34] impressing yourself and other people so
[71:38] oh
[71:40] you're it's amazing it's so good for you
[71:43] it's like the best stuff it tastes so
[71:45] good drink it every
[71:47] day oh man that thank you for for
[71:50] telling me I I didn't knew that at all
[71:53] like I I didn't knew where uh yeah soup
[71:56] interesting I have to uh dive deep into
[71:58] that later I'm already excited really
[72:00] cool um before we come uh now we have
[72:03] the end routine where the previous guest
[72:04] is asking a question for the next guest
[72:06] and the question for you from the
[72:08] previous guest is where will most
[72:10] bitcoiner live in 2035 so like probably
[72:13] what's the highest density uh of of
[72:16] Bitcoin as in the world in India highest
[72:20] density not the most yeah yeah yeah yeah
[72:24] he asked of where will the most
[72:26] bitcoiners live but I feel like uh the
[72:29] highest density is a more interesting
[72:32] question sorry for changing the question
[72:34] yeah no so very interestingly right now
[72:37] according to CH analysis the answer is
[72:39] the same wait in India they are the most
[72:40] uh dens like the they are the highest
[72:43] percentage of bitcoiners in India yeah
[72:46] well so it's getting a little bit
[72:47] because of how popular stable coins are
[72:50] it's getting a little bit harder to
[72:51] parse the the data to see like who's
[72:53] doing what uh but yeah Nigeria India uh
[72:58] Brazil some some of these uh um some of
[73:01] these Emerging Market countries with ch
[73:03] and all terrible Fiat currencies are uh
[73:06] are some of the ones that have the the
[73:08] highest amount of uh Bitcoin ownership
[73:12] um in 2035 okay that's 10 years from now
[73:16] um uh I think uh the US actually um they
[73:20] see they seem to be in a good good path
[73:22] towards that yeah really cool thank you
[73:23] so much before let you go um sorry you
[73:26] wanted to say something no no that was
[73:28] it okay uh before I let you go where can
[73:32] people find you ask you questions and
[73:33] and read more about you uh sure you find
[73:37] me on Twitter uh but I'm I'm only there
