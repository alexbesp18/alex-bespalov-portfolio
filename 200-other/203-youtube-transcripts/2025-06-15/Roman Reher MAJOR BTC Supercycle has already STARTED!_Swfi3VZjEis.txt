[00:00] the year
[00:00] 2025 is so the more interesting year and
[00:03] I think a year where probably a hard
[00:05] adoption Curve will follow if you look
[00:08] at the Bitcoin curve and you ignore the
[00:10] volatility then we are in a super cycle
[00:12] since Bitcoin is created I don't think
[00:14] that planned economy will work in any
[00:17] case not even in computer games so it
[00:19] will work never right I think Bitcoin
[00:21] will win in the end socialism systems
[00:23] attack the eny systems and eny systems
[00:26] are so small that they can't defend so
[00:28] when eny has to work or or should work
[00:31] then it has to be a global phenomen and
[00:35] which thing should uh bring us a global
[00:37] eny system there's nothing besides
[00:39] Bitcoin Bitcoin is a peaceful solution
[00:42] for a free Better World in the end open
[00:44] source will win because it's more
[00:45] efficient mainstream media will switch
[00:47] to Noster in the end not today probably
[00:49] not in the next 10 years but maybe in
[00:50] the next 20
[00:52] [Music]
[00:54] years I'm really looking forward to them
[00:57] because you are in the German speaking
[00:59] area that top guy for me like if if
[01:02] anyone ask me oh do you have Bitcoin
[01:04] content in German I always like block
[01:06] trainer it's the your channel uh like
[01:09] that's that's the go-to guy for me um to
[01:12] to go to bitcoin content and I think a
[01:15] lot of people even I I think I mentioned
[01:17] you at least like 10 times already in
[01:18] the podcast when people ask me about
[01:20] German content creators that coming from
[01:23] America so I'm really excited to to be
[01:25] here with you and and talk Bitcoin about
[01:27] with you so the first question for me is
[01:30] just to like start off with current
[01:32] things uh what were your some of your
[01:35] biggest highlights this year uh we had a
[01:37] lot in there with with like the the
[01:39] Haring all them high before harving ETFs
[01:42] uh president Trump is speaking what were
[01:44] some of your biggest highlights in in
[01:46] 2024 and and how impactful were they
[01:50] yeah I think it's uh probably two things
[01:54] um for sure the first thing are the ETFs
[01:58] because this is the game way for the big
[02:00] money so this is the first time uh where
[02:04] companies can regulate it buy Bitcoin
[02:07] easily because before you had you have
[02:10] to do so much to buy Bitcoin as a
[02:12] company especially as a as a tra public
[02:15] traded company and uh since the ETFs are
[02:18] there it's just um yeah take your
[02:21] portfolio um or your your uh your app
[02:25] where you're buying stocks and so on and
[02:28] buy Bitcoin like over the for sure and
[02:31] it's not like uh that I'm uh afraid of
[02:34] black rock or so on because I think
[02:36] Bitcoin is for everyone so for the Wall
[02:39] Street as well and I think the solution
[02:41] Bitcoin brings for us is not on yeah the
[02:45] Wall Street is now out of the game it's
[02:48] more like uh Bitcoin is a very fair
[02:52] money a very fair asset and um so all
[02:56] lies and and all all uh so when they try
[03:01] to corrupt the system they can't do this
[03:04] with Bitcoin so Bitcoin is a long-term
[03:06] solution not a short-term solution in my
[03:08] opinion and I think um so the ETFs are
[03:12] at the end very good for Bitcoin um
[03:14] because yeah a very big part of the
[03:17] society can now invest in Bitcoin and
[03:20] before it was not possible and I also
[03:23] don't think that's very dangerous
[03:25] because uh yeah probably a lot of
[03:28] Bitcoin will uh accumul at by the by the
[03:31] ETFs but I don't think that will be the
[03:35] biggest part of all Bitcoin circulating
[03:38] so the ETFs will get the most expensive
[03:42] Bitcoin but not not on the on the number
[03:45] like like on the count so it's uh they
[03:47] get expensive Bitcoin but not uh the
[03:50] biggest um stash like this yeah so and
[03:54] the next thing is uh yeah the
[03:56] presidential
[03:58] election thing with Donald Trump with
[04:01] RFK and Camus and all the politicians
[04:06] because the same thing I don't think
[04:09] Bitcoin need these guys but they need
[04:12] Bitcoin and they prove it now and even
[04:15] if Trump Is Not Elected and even if he
[04:17] don't hold his word and and he was was
[04:21] just a lie to get more more voters and
[04:23] so on what I don't think so probably he
[04:27] will not bring Bitcoin that deep in the
[04:30] in the US government as he probably
[04:33] tells but there are some parts which I
[04:35] think are very hard proven uh for
[04:38] example in the Republican um election
[04:42] paper uh there are some words uh very
[04:46] misunderstanding words like um we are
[04:49] against cbdc and uh we are for Bitcoin
[04:51] and we don't want kyc for peer-to-peer
[04:54] transactions so and you you can say ah
[04:57] probably it's it's so squishy written
[05:00] that you in the end could Pro probably
[05:03] uh switch it in the opposite thing or so
[05:06] on so this is these are some words which
[05:10] are very hard coded like uh I don't
[05:13] think uh there will come something
[05:15] different ases
[05:17] so I think that Bitcoin is discussed at
[05:22] this level is good for Bitcoin because
[05:25] this is an idea like an roote in the in
[05:29] the mind of so much people now which are
[05:32] probably never saw Bitcoin before at
[05:35] this level to probably um
[05:39] yeah have a solution for the for the
[05:42] depth problem of the US state and so on
[05:45] and uh yesterday or the day before
[05:48] yesterday there was an article from the
[05:51] financial times the British media um
[05:55] which said oh this would be a very bad
[05:57] idea to have Bitcoin as a global Reserve
[06:00] especially in a time where the dollar is
[06:03] uh more and more losing on trust um from
[06:07] other countries and if uh Donald Trump
[06:10] is now building an Bitcoin Reserve this
[06:12] will be a bad sign for the dollar
[06:13] because why should one country on the
[06:16] world now uh decide for the dollar when
[06:19] they also can decide for Bitcoin but in
[06:21] the end he also this article also said
[06:24] yeah um we need something different we
[06:27] need uh a very good
[06:30] um uh very good uh yeah very good
[06:34] decisions what the state should do with
[06:36] money he needs to be more careful he
[06:38] should do less depth and in the end you
[06:41] think yeah that's the solution Bitcoin
[06:43] brings right so uh you see there's an
[06:47] article it's against Bitcoin but the
[06:50] idea of bringing Bitcoin to the US um
[06:53] through the US government is now
[06:55] discussed and this is a way how Bitcoin
[06:57] is getting improved proved by good and
[07:01] bad words by good and bad um things that
[07:05] happen and there's a meme which just ask
[07:09] but is it good for Bitcoin and it's
[07:10] always yes right so yeah I think these
[07:14] two things the ETFs and the presidential
[07:16] election and Bitcoin as a topic are the
[07:20] biggest things uh which happened for
[07:23] mainstream Mass
[07:25] adoption but in the end even if this
[07:28] don't happen Bitcoin don't need this
[07:30] it's more like you see now they need
[07:33] Bitcoin and they want
[07:34] Bitcoin interesting could that be the
[07:37] the the start of this whole nation state
[07:40] game theory that uh it's like El
[07:42] Salvador was kind of the start but I
[07:44] feel like El Salvador is a very small
[07:46] country that it's like yeah they they
[07:49] are doing it but they don't make a big
[07:52] impact but when you the the US is
[07:54] starting when the Brit talks about that
[07:57] when other countries talking about that
[07:59] just the I think just the possibility
[08:02] that some country is is doing that that
[08:04] could be really big is that the official
[08:06] start 2024 of of game theory for nation
[08:08] states yeah yeah
[08:12] probably one one thing I was I I think I
[08:15] was it was very interesting as well
[08:17] Donald Trump said he thinks or or he he
[08:21] know that China is still playing this
[08:25] game and uh uh I was wondering how he
[08:29] could know so maybe he got some sources
[08:33] we don't have I don't know uh on the
[08:36] other side when China bans Bitcoin
[08:38] mining uh in
[08:41] 2021 um the world realized after this
[08:45] that still 20% of the hash rate are in
[08:47] China and it's probably the state
[08:49] himself so I don't know what's what's
[08:51] the best way to accumulate Bitcoin
[08:54] without uh being seen to accumulate
[08:58] Bitcoin it's to mine Bitcoin right and
[09:00] probably it's the state himself we can't
[09:02] prove this but maybe he knows more and
[09:06] I'm pretty sure if you if you look at
[09:08] the reserve of current of of company uh
[09:11] no sorry my my I don't talk in English
[09:15] so often so sorry for that so um when
[09:18] you when you look at governments and uh
[09:20] at uh countries you see in the end they
[09:24] have all kinds of assets and and
[09:27] reserves um in in form of of uh Goods or
[09:32] or stuff in the end so yeah I think why
[09:35] they shouldn't have Bitcoin for sure
[09:37] they will have Bitcoin and the first big
[09:40] Nations which going this way will pump
[09:43] this price for sure and all following
[09:45] Nations will have it much more hard to
[09:49] accumulate um Bitcoin because it's now
[09:52] after after one nation will go like the
[09:55] US will say yeah we start now with the
[09:57] reserve the price will pump and can't
[09:59] accumulate Bitcoin in in for for the
[10:03] price they probably could get Bitcoin
[10:05] before so yeah I think um this is a
[10:08] start but on a soft way because even if
[10:12] Donald Trump is elected it's not sure
[10:15] right now that he really will do this um
[10:19] but the idea is now there and uh yeah it
[10:22] will be discussed and not go away I'm
[10:25] pretty sure it's also interesting um how
[10:27] big is it for you that RF K joined Trump
[10:31] because I think RFK has is is further
[10:34] down the learning curve uh in Bitcoin
[10:36] than than Trump he he speaks better
[10:38] about Bitcoin at least he knows what to
[10:40] speak about Bitcoin and not to use
[10:42] crypto in in every thir sentence as
[10:46] Trump did um is it could that be also
[10:49] like a really positive sign for for the
[10:51] Trump Administration uh it's also
[10:53] interesting um that that crypto for
[10:57] Harris there's even like a small group
[10:58] that has Bitcoin for Harris I had uh
[11:01] Terren Young on my podcast he's a big
[11:03] proponent of of CA Harris and he's
[11:05] trying to get uh votes and donations for
[11:08] Harris so like not even in the Bitcoin
[11:10] communi is every for for Trump just U
[11:13] pointing that out but it seems like the
[11:15] the big part is like oh if if if Trump
[11:18] comes in this is like a Bitcoin
[11:19] Administration and with Harris there's
[11:22] coming chaos in and it's not a Bitcoin
[11:24] Administration um do you also see that
[11:26] and is is and how big is it that RFK is
[11:29] is in the in the administration as a
[11:32] Democrat actually yeah so all things I
[11:35] said before could probably seem like I'm
[11:39] a trump simp but I I I'm don't so I
[11:43] don't trust politicians uh at any time
[11:45] it's just see what they say and what
[11:48] they probably do but in the end yeah we
[11:51] have to realize Trump is more on the
[11:52] Bitcoin side as Harris full stop so
[11:56] that's all and uh but I'm totally with
[11:58] you um if you if you listen to Donald
[12:01] Trump you see yeah he's on the beginning
[12:03] of his Bitcoin Journey right it's a a
[12:06] lot of crypto but he makes a difference
[12:08] between Bitcoin and crypto that's good
[12:10] right and uh in the end this is one step
[12:13] further than the absolute beginner okay
[12:16] but yeah I'm with you um RFK is much
[12:20] deeper in in this and he realized more
[12:23] what Bitcoin is and what Bitcoin
[12:24] probably uh which solution can Bitcoin
[12:27] bring and um think it's good that he
[12:30] joins this party because uh when Trump
[12:32] will um discuss this topic with him he
[12:36] probably learn more about this so yeah I
[12:38] think it's good um for Bitcoin and for
[12:42] uh for the um US citizens because uh
[12:46] yeah a positive way for Bitcoin is I
[12:50] think for your for your Society the best
[12:52] thing that can happen and RFK is
[12:55] probably um so when when you see the the
[12:58] betting ODS on the election you see RFK
[13:01] had one person or so one person is
[13:04] literally nothing so one person will say
[13:08] yeah he will never be elected as a
[13:10] president but these are the betting odds
[13:13] um and this is not his supporters but
[13:16] because even if you're a supporter of
[13:18] RFK you wouldn't bet he will be the
[13:21] president and if you see how much people
[13:23] really stand behind RFK I think it's a
[13:27] very positive sign uh that he is joining
[13:30] the the Bitcoin party when you want to
[13:32] call this like this because a lot of
[13:35] people will see this and will realize
[13:37] yeah when ALK is um giving that hard
[13:40] position for Bitcoin and he joins a
[13:42] party which also give a hard position
[13:45] for Bitcoin I think in the end it's
[13:47] probably a yeah very hard push uh for
[13:51] Bitcoin adoption for the mass adoption
[13:54] which would not be there if um yeah they
[13:57] would go different way
[14:00] probably it's interesting I wanted to
[14:02] get that in because I think you're
[14:04] really big in in in Germany and and it's
[14:06] interesting to see how how you see it uh
[14:09] from an outside of us perspective
[14:11] because I have a lot of Americans on on
[14:13] my podcast also and discussed it well um
[14:16] one other thing that happened this year
[14:18] uh is the Haring the the biggest event
[14:20] in in in Bitcoin kind of uh every four
[14:23] years um and another thing that happened
[14:25] before the Haring that I think never
[14:27] happened before please correct me if I'm
[14:30] wrong um that we hit the AL them high be
[14:33] right before the Haring uh I think in
[14:35] January or February or something like
[14:36] that uh we hit new a new alltime high
[14:39] before the Haring um which brings some
[14:42] some questions in my mind does this mean
[14:43] anything or is this just like the hi
[14:45] from the ETFs and uh which this
[14:49] discussion I think is is every cycle a
[14:50] little bit coming up this discussion of
[14:52] like when will this cycle break when
[14:55] will we not have this fre foure cycle uh
[14:59] coming again and again uh is there any
[15:02] chance that we have now just like a
[15:05] normal Market that goes still up and
[15:06] down but not in those fouryear
[15:08] predictable Cycles uh and do we have
[15:12] something like a super cycle or like
[15:14] just no cycle at all uh and could that
[15:18] happen even at that one because now like
[15:20] with ETFs and maybe even nation states
[15:23] coming in and way more uh companies also
[15:26] coming into the game what do you think
[15:27] about that
[15:29] yeah um for the first you asked me uh uh
[15:33] what were what were the biggest um
[15:35] events this year and I think the Haring
[15:37] is much bigger than the ETFs and um the
[15:40] politician party thing because um this
[15:43] is the reason why Bitcoin is is uh is
[15:46] scar right so um but I don't had this uh
[15:51] this event on my mind because it's it's
[15:53] just the rule of Bitcoin and uh it was
[15:56] nothing which uh uh so unexpect happened
[16:01] right so from from these events uh I
[16:03] think the other two are more interesting
[16:05] but for sure the hav event is much more
[16:08] important and um yeah I think uh it was
[16:11] interesting that we hit the all-time
[16:13] high uh before uh the Haring or or short
[16:17] after no no no before right before I
[16:20] think before yeah I will look it up yeah
[16:22] but it was nominal not uh inflation
[16:25] corrected so if we see this in inflation
[16:28] corrected um even after 2020 and the
[16:31] whole uh Co part where so much new
[16:35] dollars were printed in in form of depth
[16:38] um you see yeah it's inflation correct
[16:41] not hit the all-time high so I think uh
[16:45] yeah it's it's it's a good sign yeah
[16:48] because people people don't uh invest
[16:52] inflation corrected I think it's it's
[16:53] more like uh they they pushed it to the
[16:57] new all-time high they were hyp
[16:59] but it was in fact no real alltime high
[17:02] and so I think um yeah we still on the
[17:05] same run like the having events before
[17:07] for me the year
[17:09] 2025 is so the more interesting year and
[17:12] I think um the year where probably a
[17:15] hard adoption Curve will follow there
[17:17] are so much uh things that will happen
[17:20] so um the presidential election we will
[17:24] see as well um a change in the monetary
[17:27] policy of the federal Reserve so it's
[17:29] very clear um the inflation rate is
[17:32] going down so they uh will decrease the
[17:36] um uh the uh interest rate as well and
[17:40] um this results always in more money and
[17:43] more investing money so uh stocks and
[17:46] and assets will go up so yeah this uh is
[17:51] what I think will happen for 2025 but
[17:54] I'm not 100% sure because there are some
[17:58] unexpected or probably unexpecting
[18:00] events uh when you see the Ukraine um
[18:04] war and so on yeah maybe there's some
[18:09] maybe there are some events which you
[18:11] can't count with now and uh they happen
[18:15] so but if if this will uh still work on
[18:20] a level like now and there's nothing no
[18:24] surprise U then 2025 will probably very
[18:27] hard and I don't think it will be in um
[18:31] super cycle would like Bitcoin will
[18:34] never go down again this will not happen
[18:37] even the Wall Street when when they're
[18:39] joining Bitcoin and will um bring very
[18:42] high prices for Bitcoin they also
[18:45] realize gains in US dollar I'm pretty
[18:47] sure so because these companies are not
[18:51] hardcore Bitcoin maximalist they
[18:53] probably will be in the future but they
[18:55] are not now and uh they will realize
[18:58] gain and US dollar because this is what
[19:01] hedge funds and others do for their
[19:03] customers they they try to get more
[19:06] dollar out of this and not to get more
[19:08] Bitcoin out of this so this will
[19:10] probably the future but not in the short
[19:13] term maybe in a very long term and yeah
[19:16] if you look at the Bitcoin curve and you
[19:18] you you ignore the volatility then we
[19:21] are in a super cycle since Bitcoin is
[19:23] created right so
[19:26] yeah it's it's interesting because like
[19:28] there's this this like uh up up up down
[19:31] cycle in in Bitcoin I'm like I hope we
[19:34] can maybe get to a point where just like
[19:36] every year is a little bit up like it
[19:37] doesn't have to be the same one but uh
[19:39] maybe just wishful thinking of my side
[19:42] um really cool um by the way I just
[19:45] looked it up we hit uh before the Haring
[19:47] the 71,000 US dollar Mark and after it
[19:50] again uh so we kind of hit it um two
[19:54] times uh but yeah before and after like
[19:57] in in March and after a may we also hit
[19:59] it again um now to the really
[20:02] interesting part that I'm always looking
[20:03] forward in the in the podcast when we
[20:05] talk about uh Bitcoin nied world uh when
[20:09] we now look out maybe even beyond our
[20:13] lives uh when we look out in our kids
[20:16] and grandkids lives and we we just think
[20:18] like okay we are at a kind of a Bitcoin
[20:20] World Bitcoin standard world uh where
[20:22] Bitcoin is so normal as a store of value
[20:25] maybe even as a medium of exchange maybe
[20:27] even as a unit of account
[20:29] um how different is that world besides a
[20:32] different money is how how different can
[20:35] that be uh from your perspective for for
[20:38] the world on an Society level on an
[20:40] individual level wherever you want to go
[20:42] with that question it's hard to answer
[20:45] because um uh when you become a
[20:48] bitcoiner in the end you realize uh you
[20:51] can decide what's good for you but you
[20:53] can't decide what's good for the society
[20:54] or for other people and this makes a
[20:57] prediction very hard so if you try to do
[21:00] this on a economical way like um you say
[21:05] yeah probably the the the most efficient
[21:09] way would be some kind of Anarchy or so
[21:13] yeah probably this was a final result
[21:15] and uh we find ways um to to find
[21:18] solution for for things the state is
[21:21] doing today in on a market way but I
[21:25] think this is so far away that it's
[21:27] probably not all problem and um it's
[21:30] hard to say yeah this will the final
[21:32] result we don't we don't really know um
[21:34] from from a logical way I would say yeah
[21:36] that's the final result and that's
[21:38] probably the the best state and um I
[21:42] think but but I need to be clear at this
[21:45] point I don't think eny is chaos I think
[21:48] this is a kind of of all news speech or
[21:51] how how would you call this um where you
[21:53] have two different um explanations for
[21:57] one thing and Anarchy in the end is more
[22:00] like you have you have rules and
[22:02] everything in a society but these rules
[22:04] are not made by the by a state so this
[22:07] what people think what Anarchy is is
[22:10] more enomy so like uh it's a state where
[22:14] you have really no rules and so on and
[22:16] Warlords are are the masters of the
[22:19] world and uh the people are just killing
[22:22] themselves but I think um the best way
[22:24] is a Cooperative way because it's the
[22:26] most efficient way and um way of large
[22:31] um product processes and process chains
[22:34] which yeah in in in which you as a as
[22:39] one of the society as as one of the
[22:41] market participants if if someone will
[22:44] damage you he will damage the whole
[22:45] process chain right and in the end it's
[22:47] bad for everyone so bad actors are not
[22:50] acting against um one Parts in in this
[22:54] market they all way um fighting against
[22:58] the whole market so the whole Market the
[23:00] whole society is interested in in a
[23:03] peaceful way and uh in a coopertive way
[23:06] and try to find Solutions versus Bad
[23:08] actors and I think this is probably the
[23:11] best state but it's maybe an utopy is
[23:14] the right word in English as well yeah
[23:17] and I'm not really sure if if we will
[23:19] reach this but if we can reach this then
[23:22] Bitcoin is um is the tool for this for
[23:25] the society but when you realize we live
[23:28] in a world today in a Fiat World um
[23:31] where the US uh USA are the largest by
[23:36] by far largest military power I think
[23:38] three times larger than China and Russia
[23:42] together and uh you realize this is all
[23:45] Fiat funded and in the end um to to um
[23:50] make this process efficient you have to
[23:54] um yeah I I don't know the English word
[23:56] like it's it's a B in German
[24:00] uh so backwards I don't know yeah you
[24:05] you need to you you need to to uh yeah
[24:08] you need to be very efficient in the end
[24:10] and this is probably a process which
[24:12] will take a lot of time and um yeah it
[24:16] can so much happen in the process but I
[24:19] think Bitcoin is like a trian troan
[24:21] horse because uh
[24:23] all politicians all people which are
[24:27] today
[24:29] uh which have today a lot of power and a
[24:31] lot of Might will realize yeah I can
[24:35] stay on the loser side on the Fiat side
[24:37] or I can join the the Bitcoin economy
[24:39] side and um when I when I become a a
[24:43] very efficient and very Cooperative
[24:46] Market participant it's in the end the
[24:48] best case for me so I think probably we
[24:52] don't see that the world um when when
[24:55] it's become a Bitcoin IED world
[24:58] uh will have a large war of power it's
[25:01] more like it the fear world will
[25:04] decrease decrease decrease and in the
[25:06] end we have a free world and that's the
[25:08] best case I think and this is what I
[25:11] also think probably happen is it fair to
[25:14] say that we have kind of like a a fork
[25:17] that we are going through the the one
[25:19] way is where we have Bitcoin and
[25:21] capitalism and and the world that you
[25:23] describe right now and the other world
[25:24] is cbdcs and communism and and total
[25:27] total control monitoring of of the
[25:29] citizens is is that uh in the end of the
[25:32] day the the decision that citizens and
[25:34] the world uh has as to to take or can
[25:38] cbdcs and Fiat uh be uh Liv together in
[25:42] hybrid for a very long time yeah they
[25:45] can and I think there will be but in the
[25:48] end it's still The Winner Takes it all
[25:51] and since I don't think that uh planned
[25:54] economy will work in any case not even
[25:57] in in computer game so it will work
[25:59] never right so uh I think Bitcoin will
[26:03] win in the end yeah but um uh when you
[26:07] let's talk about um Anarchy again
[26:09] because there are so much uh yeah what's
[26:12] the word um experiments uh Anarchy
[26:16] experiments on the world and they all
[26:17] failed and you have to ask why so why
[26:20] should Bitcoin uh don't fail why should
[26:23] Anarchy and other things fail but not
[26:25] with Bitcoin and uh when you try to find
[26:28] out what happened then it's always that
[26:30] socialism systems attack the eny systems
[26:33] and enery systems are so small that they
[26:35] can't defend so when eny has to work or
[26:39] or should work then it has to be a
[26:41] global phenomen and which thing should
[26:46] uh bring us a global eny system so
[26:48] there's nothing besides Bitcoin and now
[26:51] Bitcoin is there so I think yeah it's
[26:54] it's not like there's a cbdc state and
[26:56] there's a Bitcoin State I think think
[26:58] there's socialism and cbdc states and
[27:02] Bitcoin is in this like this Stan horse
[27:04] and will decrease this from inside out
[27:07] right and so in the end I think Bitcoin
[27:11] is a peaceful solution for a free better
[27:13] world and this is what Bitcoin makes so
[27:16] great because you don't have to uh you
[27:19] don't have to stand behind the polit
[27:21] political participant or uh or
[27:24] politician or a company or so on it's
[27:27] more more like Bitcoin will bring this
[27:30] world um a sovereign tool um yeah
[27:34] which is good for for
[27:38] efficient people and bad for people
[27:41] which try to Rob others or do things
[27:44] like this I have one question now that I
[27:48] since like I think a week or something
[27:49] like that I keep asking my my guest
[27:51] because I don't have a good answer to
[27:53] that I even asked yesterday Max kais
[27:55] about that um his answer was first 100
[27:59] and then 65 as a spoiler for you uh and
[28:03] the question is right now is Bitcoin is
[28:06] it depends on which numbers you're
[28:08] looking at but Bitcoin is around 0.1% of
[28:10] the global wealth uh when you go with
[28:13] Jesse Maya system with the 900 trillion
[28:16] uh uh and I think saor also uses that as
[28:19] a as a base case uh for for as a base
[28:22] model for for his predictions um the the
[28:26] big question is is always when Bitcoin
[28:30] is successful and we are in a Bitcoin
[28:32] world uh depending like the timing is
[28:35] really difficult for me like the timing
[28:37] I think is is almost impossible to guess
[28:39] but whenever we hit that Bitcoin World
[28:42] um what do you think will be the the the
[28:46] global net worth in Bitcoin uh my
[28:49] logical conclusion is always like okay
[28:50] if if if Bitcoin is money money is half
[28:53] of every transaction 50% is is kind of a
[28:56] logical conclusion for me um but does
[28:59] Bitcoin stop at 50% how do you see like
[29:02] if Bitcoin is successful and we're
[29:03] living in a Bitcoin World um how much
[29:07] how much percent of the global wealth
[29:09] can Bitcoin subsume no matter what the
[29:12] timing is it could be 50 years it could
[29:14] be 500 or 5,000 years um but what's the
[29:17] what's the end goal of of of Bitcoin
[29:20] yeah I'm a I'm a big fan of the
[29:22] peridural principle so the perid
[29:24] principle says um you do 20% of
[29:28] the work and get 80% result and to get
[29:31] the last 20% result you have to do 80%
[29:34] of the work so why you why should do you
[29:37] so do 20% of the work get 80% of the
[29:40] result and this is very efficient and in
[29:43] the end I think this could probably
[29:45] happen to the world um starting in the
[29:47] Bitcoin economy like um my savings are
[29:50] 80% in Bitcoin 20% I use for my my home
[29:55] my my living costs and
[29:58] um probably things I try out to get more
[30:01] money in the end so this is my risk
[30:04] Capital 20% I think this is probably not
[30:08] that bad and I think this probably will
[30:12] also happen in the mining sector so when
[30:16] you decide to create a good you today
[30:20] measure your costs in money like the
[30:23] dollar or Euro but in the end you could
[30:28] also measure this in energy like you say
[30:31] hey how much energy do I need to create
[30:35] a car and I don't don't mean only the
[30:39] energy cost of your of your company it's
[30:42] also the cost of your of your workers
[30:45] like they need food and everything so
[30:47] you can't measure this energy right this
[30:49] is a big problem but Bitcoin mining is
[30:52] like a global Arbitrage of energy and
[30:56] energy price so in the final State I
[30:59] think when on one point on the world
[31:03] energy is getting very cheap the minor
[31:06] will will the minor companies or mining
[31:09] persons will bring their machines
[31:10] through this cheap area will get the
[31:13] energy and will make Bitcoin out of this
[31:15] so the energy price is rising at this
[31:17] moment and we'll find a level which is
[31:20] globally very similar to to all
[31:24] countries and um so yeah there probably
[31:27] sometimes some some volatility but I
[31:30] think it's in the end a very very same
[31:33] price for Energy globally and this
[31:36] results in um you can measure because of
[31:41] your costs the energy usage do you need
[31:45] for creating a car or uh bake a pizza I
[31:49] don't know right and so you also have to
[31:55] decide what's the best thing I can do
[31:58] with my energy can I create a car can I
[32:00] create a pizza can I mine Bitcoin and
[32:05] this will be will be an Arbitrage
[32:07] between Bitcoin and and all other
[32:10] creation so in the mining process and I
[32:13] think probably even this is in the end
[32:17] under the Paro principle so I think
[32:19] maybe 80% of all energy uses by Humanity
[32:24] in the future I don't know in probably
[32:26] thousand years will be used for Bitcoin
[32:28] mining and the rest 20% will be used
[32:32] for science creating new stuff bring
[32:36] more efficient in your business model
[32:38] create cars create food I don't know so
[32:42] I think yeah 80% of
[32:45] every Sav money will be probably in
[32:48] Bitcoin and of all asset prices and
[32:50] everything and even the the energy usage
[32:53] of the of the global Human Society or
[32:57] probably Interstellar Global Society
[32:59] then will be used for Bitcoin mining if
[33:01] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[33:03] regular basis I'll guess you already
[33:06] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[33:08] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[33:11] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:14] personal recommendation for Hardware
[33:15] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[33:18] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[33:21] gift for a friend who has still the
[33:23] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[33:26] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[33:29] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[33:33] to get your bitbox and if you really
[33:36] want to bulletproof your self custody
[33:38] setup your security setup and maybe even
[33:41] your citizenship setup you have to talk
[33:44] to the Bitcoin way if you go to the
[33:46] Bitcoin way.com
[33:49] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[33:52] free call where you can dive deep with
[33:56] them if you're self custody setup is
[33:58] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[34:01] maybe might be improvable or your
[34:04] digital footprint in general is secure
[34:07] they are the experts in cyber security
[34:10] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[34:13] secure sovereign individual in general
[34:16] and last but not least I have something
[34:18] completely new for you guys I partnered
[34:22] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[34:25] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:28] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:31] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:34] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[34:37] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[34:40] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:42] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[34:46] make sure to check out the link in the
[34:48] description for this amazing coin
[34:50] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[34:53] amazing I love them so much it was
[34:54] really hard for me to pick the one that
[34:57] I want to have because there are a lot
[34:59] of great options I went with the new
[35:01] transparency Edition they're all limited
[35:05] so grab yours those will not be
[35:07] available for a long time but there will
[35:09] come new models and new amazing designs
[35:12] along the way I love that answer a lot
[35:14] really really cool and uh now I think
[35:17] you also you learned it as I'm right
[35:20] right you learned it yeah I think it's a
[35:23] great question then um when we look at
[35:26] like okay we have Bitcoin now and there
[35:29] was the block size wol with Big Blocks
[35:30] and stuff like that uh and then there
[35:32] always the uh discussion okay how do we
[35:34] scale Bitcoin uh from now like maybe a
[35:37] few Millions uh that have it and
[35:39] actually use it as as like a day-to-day
[35:41] uh thing or like maybe even like give
[35:43] one transaction per month with from The
[35:46] Exchange to their cold wallet like most
[35:47] people don't touch their Bitcoin uh a
[35:50] lot they just like leave it in the in
[35:52] the cold wallet if if they have
[35:54] something like that um so how do we
[35:56] scale from this this current state of of
[35:59] Bitcoin to a state where billions uh
[36:04] every day can use it as a day-to-day
[36:06] Medi of
[36:08] exchange so you you you mean because of
[36:11] um of the block size limit or uh you you
[36:16] think about second layer Solutions or
[36:18] second layers definitely second layers
[36:20] like I think we we're kind of like it
[36:22] always pops up a little bit in that
[36:24] discussions but I think you and I and
[36:27] most bitcoiners agree we have to scale
[36:29] in in layer Solutions and and and not on
[36:31] on the main layer because yeah then it's
[36:33] not decentralized anymore with with
[36:35] higher high block space so like how how
[36:37] do we scale in in enlightening fent uh
[36:41] there so many other Solutions out there
[36:44] um H how do we succeed in having every
[36:48] everyone that that everyone is possible
[36:50] to transact on bitcoin also see
[36:53] different models where we have like an
[36:54] onion model where like a lot of layer
[36:56] two technologies around Bitcoin coin or
[36:58] are we stacking layer sevens layer
[37:00] Eights on on top of Bitcoin how do you
[37:02] see that yeah I think it's uh it begins
[37:06] with uh how do you um how do you
[37:09] categorize the layers so uh yeah
[37:12] probably a network which is not
[37:14] interacting with the Bitcoin network but
[37:16] with lightning is probably a layer three
[37:18] model but what if this layer is also
[37:21] interacting with Bitcoin what is it then
[37:23] so I don't know it's very hard so but
[37:25] I'm with you uh we can't scale that much
[37:29] in the uh in the Bitcoin main layer or
[37:32] probably we shouldn't do because uh if
[37:34] you change the rules for that you will
[37:37] uh cut out a lot of participant of the
[37:39] network and this is very bad for Bitcoin
[37:42] we saw this in the past and um I I'm
[37:45] pretty
[37:46] sure we don't need bigger blocks for for
[37:49] this world because Bitcoin is for me the
[37:51] clearing Network right and uh we can
[37:54] scale in other networks but there are
[37:56] probably limited um based on the
[37:59] technology they choose for example
[38:01] lightning has
[38:03] other um scalability problems or or
[38:07] other tradeoffs than fedy Min right and
[38:12] in the end I think it's um there are two
[38:15] things very important the first thing is
[38:17] the first thing is people want to use
[38:19] Bitcoin as a money but when because when
[38:22] they want to use Bitcoin as a money and
[38:24] the main layer is getting expensive
[38:26] they're interested in finding solutions
[38:28] to scale because when you just say ah
[38:31] I'm pretty sure in the future we will we
[38:33] will use Bitcoin as a money so we need
[38:35] now a solution for this this will never
[38:38] bring a a good second layer which which
[38:43] knows or or which is perfectly designed
[38:46] for the problems of the future because
[38:48] we don't know which problems will come
[38:50] up in this moment so we will find
[38:54] technology when we have a problem and
[38:57] the this technology we find will be a
[38:59] solution that's always the case well so
[39:01] without Fiat money we
[39:03] don't we we we hadn't become or we
[39:06] hadn't get Bitcoin because uh fat money
[39:10] was a problem Bitcoin was the solution
[39:12] and uh when fat money were not that bad
[39:15] it was probably a little bad okay we
[39:18] never uh get Bitcoin so there have to be
[39:21] a problem and then we will find a
[39:23] solution and there's not now a problem
[39:27] for using Bitcoin as money so I think
[39:29] the main layer is cheap yeah in some
[39:31] phases it's now expensive okay but in
[39:34] this moment you can use lightning or so
[39:35] on and um in other faces like where we
[39:39] are now even the main layer is very
[39:41] cheap so there's no real actual problem
[39:44] and when we get these problems we will
[39:47] get Solutions and I can tell you now how
[39:49] these Solutions will look like but I
[39:51] think probably it will not the one
[39:56] second layer which thought all this
[39:58] problems but it will be an in layer
[40:01] where we connect several second layers
[40:04] to one solution so there's probably a
[40:07] solution which is using
[40:09] for for a a payment um a very fast cheap
[40:13] payment it will use lightning for a
[40:15] trusted payment I don't know when you
[40:18] invest in the company or so on maybe F
[40:20] Min I don't know yeah that's that's
[40:22] several um layers and I think you will
[40:24] have a software in the end which decides
[40:26] for you you as a user don't know what
[40:29] the software does you just know I have
[40:31] my words and I know this is in self
[40:34] custody no one can steal from me and
[40:36] this technology is using I don't know
[40:39] layers to send uh money like you today
[40:43] use your television before it was just a
[40:47] a one-way ticket now your television is
[40:50] uh High technical computer device and
[40:55] you can watch Netflix and so on and 30
[40:58] years ago it was two sides of of script
[41:03] typing to or or development to send an
[41:06] email so and today you can watch live
[41:10] stream videos over your television so
[41:13] you never know as a user probably how
[41:16] this really works you just know it works
[41:18] and yeah since Bitcoin is a Technology
[41:21] based on open source protocols I'm
[41:23] pretty sure this open source protocols
[41:27] will will be also the Solutions in
[41:28] second layers so I don't think there's
[41:31] in the end a closed company protocol
[41:33] which is better than everything else
[41:35] there will be some I'm pretty sure but I
[41:37] don't think they will win the r the race
[41:40] at the end and this is probably a very
[41:45] longterm battle but in the end open
[41:48] source will win because it's more
[41:49] efficient more participant can develop
[41:51] this can look into problems and it's
[41:54] much cheaper to use open source
[41:56] technology except of close Source
[41:59] technology because there are licenses
[42:01] and everything else and you see this in
[42:03] technology always like you know the HDMI
[42:06] standard for your cables for your
[42:08] monitor and there's a display port
[42:10] standard and the display port standard
[42:12] was funded um open source because the
[42:15] HDMI standard is a is um there are a
[42:19] bunch of companies I think Toshiba
[42:21] Samsung and so on they created this and
[42:23] they have the license and every monitor
[42:26] every television which is sold with the
[42:28] HDMI standard has to pay yearly for this
[42:33] for this uh ports per monitor for that's
[42:37] crazy right so and so the the industry
[42:40] decides yeah we we build another
[42:42] standard and display port is faster it's
[42:44] uh just the better standard and it's
[42:47] free you just can use this because it's
[42:49] open source so in the end open source
[42:51] will win always but there's probably a
[42:53] very long time frame where uh closed uh
[42:57] software is for a time frame better so
[43:01] yeah I think we will scale over some
[43:04] companies like custodians and we will
[43:06] scale over open source Technologies and
[43:09] these Technologies are probably a stack
[43:11] of software like um the internet is a
[43:13] software stack uh or or a lot of
[43:17] Technologies we use today are software
[43:19] Stacks right really cool I I have two
[43:23] interesting um questions for that the
[43:26] the first as you said uh we will know
[43:28] our our keys basically our phrases our
[43:31] words uh and then use Bitcoin
[43:34] um I'm more and more pessimistic about
[43:37] self- custody being mainstream the more
[43:39] more I talk about outside of our Bitcoin
[43:43] Twitter and Bitcoin YouTube podcasting
[43:45] uh bubble uh where I I have friends that
[43:49] I talk to since years uh and even were
[43:52] in Celsius involved and stuff like that
[43:54] and they still have everything on
[43:55] Exchange and I'm like hey like go just
[43:59] buy a bit box or whatever and then put
[44:01] it on there I will show you I will guide
[44:03] you through the whole process uh there
[44:05] are like Services their advisor there
[44:07] like the whole ecosystem is already kind
[44:09] of built do you do you think that self-
[44:11] custody will will at some point be
[44:14] mainstream or will be will uh will
[44:18] people rely on bitcoin Banks and
[44:20] exchanges and and all those things
[44:23] longterm and uh self cust will self
[44:25] custody will only be for a niche group
[44:28] that really wants to take their freedom
[44:29] and their sovereignty in their own hands
[44:32] there's a German speak um which says
[44:36] children who are not allowed to do
[44:38] anything become adults uh adults who
[44:41] cannot do anything so if you are not
[44:44] allowed to do mistakes you will never
[44:47] learn how to deal with mistakes or or
[44:50] with hard situations and the Fiat system
[44:53] is based on trust me bro I will bring
[44:55] you a solution for your problem
[44:57] so you don't have to do so this is why
[45:00] we have States and everything so this is
[45:02] the reason why they say hey it's good
[45:03] that we print money so you don't have to
[45:07] buy a street or or pay for the police in
[45:10] the end you you pay for this you you
[45:12] just uh give another person or another
[45:15] um company or or another another group
[45:19] the power to do this but in the end uh
[45:21] this is problem so the view of our
[45:24] society today is I I saw of heard people
[45:28] uh saying yeah I I think Bitcoin is not
[45:31] good for Humanity because humanity is
[45:33] too stupid but I think they're stupid
[45:35] because they are in a system which holds
[45:37] them stupid because it's doing all the
[45:40] [ __ ] for you and that's a problem so
[45:43] when Bitcoin is the long-term solution
[45:45] for sovereignity and for
[45:49] doing be being empowered to do your
[45:52] stuff for yourself and doing mistakes
[45:54] and dealing with mistakes and finding
[45:56] solutions by yourself I think you will
[45:58] learn to be to be more Sovereign and
[46:01] learn to self custody so yeah in the
[46:04] first moment I think the today's system
[46:07] will bring a lot of custodian Solutions
[46:11] and this is okay because this is the
[46:13] development way and if I play Murphy's
[46:17] Law on all this custodians in the end
[46:19] there will no custodian hold my Bitcoin
[46:22] because that's a single point of failure
[46:23] and Murphy's Law in the end says which
[46:25] can fail will fail so they will all fail
[46:28] it's just a matter of time and then you
[46:31] are probably poor because you lost
[46:34] everything and you can do this again and
[46:36] again and again and then you will stay
[46:38] poor or you will realize okay I probably
[46:41] should self custody and so this is the
[46:44] process it will maybe take some time 50
[46:49] years or so but this will happen in the
[46:51] end yeah in the first moment as I said
[46:53] before as the technology part as well is
[46:56] a scaling part as well it's probably is
[46:58] a very um very Central solution and and
[47:02] U Solution by by um yeah company or
[47:07] so yeah and there's another interesting
[47:11] perspective of my view uh or which which
[47:13] I think about it's when you have today
[47:17] your your Fiat money and you try to buy
[47:19] Goods or stuff on Amazon or other
[47:23] services you need a trust party for the
[47:26] trans ction so there's no way around so
[47:29] if you want to buy something on Amazon
[47:31] you can't say hey Amazon I will send you
[47:33] a letter with some money in it and then
[47:35] sent me the good this is not happening
[47:38] so you need a trusted party like uh
[47:41] Mastercard or so on and because you need
[47:45] the trusted party you are yeah the
[47:48] victim of The Trusted party because if
[47:51] you can't trust them but you have to
[47:52] trust them you have a problem and this
[47:54] is the same problem the dollar res in a
[47:57] in a money made out of thin air because
[48:01] before it was backed by gold and a
[48:04] trusted party uh uses their their right
[48:07] they corrupted and um destroyed this
[48:09] construct and even if there is a point
[48:12] where construct can be corrupted by a
[48:14] trusted party it will be
[48:16] corrupted with Fiat money you have no
[48:18] choice they can be corrupted today and
[48:21] you have still to use them so what's
[48:23] your decision in the end yeah nothing
[48:25] you can't do anything if you want to buy
[48:27] a good on Amazon you have to use the
[48:28] trusted
[48:29] party when Bitcoin is hard money and a
[48:32] network layer
[48:34] which gives you the power if you want to
[48:37] do the transaction by yourself you don't
[48:40] have to trust a custodian in the end so
[48:43] maybe you have 10% of your money on the
[48:46] C custodian side and if he want to shut
[48:48] down you you still can do your payment
[48:51] so you don't have to trust them in the
[48:53] end and this is very good because now
[48:56] these pay providers are just Market
[48:59] participants and if they don't do their
[49:01] job good they will lose market share and
[49:04] they will go away this is not the case
[49:07] today because we have a money depends on
[49:09] these Market
[49:11] participants so I'm not a enemy of of a
[49:17] of a company which is very profession or
[49:21] or
[49:22] very what's what's the English word so
[49:25] when when they are focused on doing one
[49:28] product really really good why you
[49:30] should decide to build your own car or
[49:33] build your own house you can do it's
[49:35] it's good if you can do but it's better
[49:38] if you know you can do and you can
[49:40] decide uh to buy the product of a good
[49:43] good company and by payments I think
[49:45] it's in the end the same and if a
[49:47] company is is using their power and the
[49:50] money the people are having uh having
[49:53] start at the custodian and and you you
[49:56] go away with the money or so on not the
[49:58] whole money system is crashing it's a
[50:00] part of the society yeah it's bad for
[50:02] them so never let all your money on on a
[50:05] custodian but you don't have to let all
[50:07] your money on the custodian part because
[50:09] in the end can just if you want do a
[50:12] transaction with your own full node or
[50:15] your own lightning full node or your own
[50:17] lightning channels and this means not
[50:20] everyone needs a lightning channel for
[50:21] the sovereignty it's the part of the
[50:24] network which which will allows you this
[50:27] if you really have to yeah and that's
[50:30] the reason why I think um it's not that
[50:33] bad to use custodians uh in a in a free
[50:37] market and they are just companies I
[50:40] like that a lot uh it's a a great
[50:43] comparison also that that one in the
[50:44] beginning um the second one that I was
[50:47] wondering uh about the question about uh
[50:49] um social about um scaling uh where you
[50:53] talked about open source is always
[50:55] better than closed source SCE um there's
[50:58] now in Bitcoin the Nostra protocol
[51:01] getting more and more popularity but if
[51:04] you really look at it like most people
[51:06] still are watching the videos on YouTube
[51:08] most people are still um tweeting on
[51:10] Twitter and not on Nostra um it's a
[51:13] really hard Network effect that those
[51:15] platforms have that that can be cracked
[51:18] but do you think also like the same
[51:20] princip that you see in Bitcoin and the
[51:23] open source is winning against closed
[51:25] source that the will win across all uh
[51:29] Departments of of the world if we can
[51:31] say it like that so maybe next one is
[51:33] social media especially with Banning I
[51:35] think simply Bitcoin uh scared some some
[51:38] you Bitcoin
[51:39] YouTubers me me me for at least simply
[51:43] Bitcoin was like banned for like five
[51:45] days or something like that on on on
[51:46] YouTube do you think open sourcing
[51:49] social media is is the next uh way yeah
[51:53] and uh still the same process uh there
[51:55] have to be a problem that people realize
[51:57] they need a solution and if you are not
[51:59] banned by the media but you know yeah
[52:02] probably they can ban me uh you will not
[52:05] leave this network with the highest um
[52:09] uh usability so because if you do you
[52:12] cut yourself from from all other network
[52:15] participants and so this is the reason
[52:17] why nosta when it was created had so so
[52:21] low user base and the user base will
[52:24] increase when problems in the real world
[52:27] are getting bigger and bigger and even
[52:29] here you can you can do this Murphy's
[52:31] Law thing so there's nothing which can
[52:33] stop Noster so it will stay there are a
[52:36] lot of things that can happen to X so
[52:40] formally Twitter or Instagram or
[52:43] something else so yeah in the end um
[52:45] just play Murphy's Law and all this
[52:47] stuff and nosta will win uh yeah they
[52:50] have to be a problem for the solution
[52:52] and so I'm not that guy which tells the
[52:55] people oh you now have have to do Noster
[52:57] and you you let's create a new new
[53:00] network and and this will be great in
[53:02] the end so why should the people do this
[53:05] now yeah when you have a problem you
[53:07] should do but this is pro no one have to
[53:10] force the market will do this um for the
[53:13] for himself so I don't know what's good
[53:15] for people and if someone uh says oh I'm
[53:18] I'm I feel much better on Noster yeah
[53:21] use Noster please because uh this is
[53:23] your solution but if someone says I have
[53:25] no problem on Twitter yeah then use
[53:28] Twitter and if you have no problem on
[53:30] Instagram then use Instagram but I don't
[53:32] think you will be
[53:34] the the efficient market participant by
[53:38] using Instagram because there are
[53:40] information missing because Instagram is
[53:42] filtering and sensoring so yeah you will
[53:46] be probably getting poor or poor of
[53:50] information over time if you use these
[53:52] sensoring platforms and you probably do
[53:55] better on Noster but maybe you also do
[53:58] do more worse on Noster in a very early
[54:01] time frame like now because a lot of
[54:03] information is not shared on Noster
[54:05] right now because not all market so not
[54:08] all people of the society are there so
[54:11] yeah this will be not a hard switch this
[54:14] will
[54:15] be here as well uh there's one network
[54:18] which can't be destroyed and all others
[54:23] can be destroyed but the interesting
[54:24] thing on Noster is
[54:26] that X is a platform combining two
[54:30] things even as Instagram and so on so
[54:33] the one thing is the communication layer
[54:36] and the other thing is the app you use
[54:38] for this communication layer Noster is a
[54:41] different thing because Noster is the
[54:42] protocol for the communication and the
[54:44] apps building on Noster are Iris or
[54:47] damus or amethyst and so on and they are
[54:50] just using the same language or speaking
[54:53] protocol and so you can de side in your
[54:56] app which relay is the relay I want to
[55:00] get information from because information
[55:02] have to be filtered in in a free uh
[55:05] communication layer because you can spam
[55:07] right so you need some spam protection
[55:10] or
[55:11] spamming or or filtering things which
[55:14] letting through good information and uh
[55:17] blocking
[55:19] noise and in the end you have probably
[55:22] companies which do this for you and if a
[55:24] company is do this good you have have a
[55:27] very clear very nice Network and I think
[55:30] Nostra is able to transform our social
[55:33] media platforms to companies which do
[55:36] this for you like Twitter is probably in
[55:39] the future be able to use the Noster
[55:42] protocol instead of the own
[55:44] communication protocol on their own
[55:46] servers and this will make Twitter feeds
[55:50] readable in
[55:52] damus which results in Brazil couldn't
[55:56] then a the noer protocol right so um
[56:00] there are so many good ways for free
[56:02] speech um through the Noster protocol
[56:06] even if you don't use these Solutions
[56:08] today which are there like demos and so
[56:10] on because maybe mainstream media will
[56:12] switch to Noster in the end not today
[56:15] probably not in the next 10 years but
[56:17] maybe in the next 20 years I don't know
[56:18] uh I think so too and and I think just
[56:21] the just the thing that nostras there is
[56:25] forcing because 100% e mask is aware of
[56:28] Nostra and and things like that uh and
[56:31] only the existence of Nostra makes
[56:35] Twitter more competitive because El mask
[56:37] is like okay if if we Banning people and
[56:40] Shadow Banning people they will notice
[56:41] and they will flee the platform and hey
[56:43] a should be the freedom of speech
[56:45] platform and and not Nostra so even the
[56:48] existence of uh nost I feel like makes
[56:51] Twitter a better place uh which is a
[56:53] really cool phenomenon yeah and this is
[56:56] a this is a big part because you are
[56:59] totally right and um all all the time
[57:02] when when Noster is getting bigger and
[57:04] bigger and bigger this effect will be
[57:05] stronger and stronger and
[57:07] stronger this is the same thing with
[57:10] Bitcoin so people say yeah when Bitcoin
[57:13] is global money in 200 years why should
[57:15] I buy Bitcoin today yeah the reason is
[57:17] very simple on the way to to this
[57:20] Bitcoin standard Bitcoin is the
[57:22] alternative for Fiat money so they can't
[57:24] print without a because people will will
[57:27] run into Bitcoin when they do so Bitcoin
[57:30] will make the Fiat World more efficient
[57:32] even in the end the Fiat world can't win
[57:34] but it will make the world more
[57:36] efficient and Will Repair uh in small
[57:39] steps just because Bitcoin is an
[57:41] alternative and when Bitcoin is getting
[57:43] bigger it's the same result like with
[57:45] Noster I'm totally with you yes really
[57:48] really cool um before we come to the end
[57:49] routine of the podcast I have one more
[57:52] uh question or segment um it is uh I
[57:56] remember a few years ago or maybe even
[57:58] last year I don't know when exactly it
[58:00] was I saw some personal videos of you
[58:02] where you talked about how Bitcoin
[58:04] changed you uh and how you changed your
[58:07] diet and and and all those things um so
[58:10] the question for you is how did Bitcoin
[58:13] and being uh out in the open with
[58:15] YouTube and out in the open with with
[58:17] Twitter uh change
[58:19] you yeah completely I would say because
[58:22] um yeah not not not no not completely
[58:25] but in very um important parts of myself
[58:29] because when I was young um I saw things
[58:33] like 911 and everything else and I was
[58:36] so afraid of and I said W these parts of
[58:38] the world are so mighty and so evil I
[58:42] don't know who this was but I know I'm
[58:45] just such a small light uh what could I
[58:48] change yeah nothing I I can change
[58:50] nothing on this and I feel very
[58:52] depressed and very um yeah I don't feel
[58:56] free in the end and then I realized yeah
[58:58] this Fiat games so I don't call it Fiat
[59:02] game at this time I think it was 2008 or
[59:04] so but um I called it um yeah in this
[59:07] game you can you can you can learn the
[59:11] rules like you play uh chess or
[59:14] something else you learn learn the
[59:15] gaming rules and if you play this game
[59:18] you can do it you can create a good
[59:20] state for yourself so I made my career
[59:23] and I made a good career on a global
[59:25] player and was in in it management and
[59:28] so on and I get good good money and so
[59:30] on and then I became very ill so uh I
[59:35] developed several autoimmune diseases
[59:37] like um in 2019 like autoimmune
[59:40] pancreatitis hepatitis um Crohn's
[59:43] disease and uh enk losing spilus like a
[59:47] lot of a bunch of so and um when I when
[59:51] I get the information that
[59:53] I'm that I have the all these diseases I
[59:58] realized okay probably I'm dead in three
[60:00] months because my my my liver was
[60:02] totally
[60:04] um and I don't know the English word but
[60:07] it's yeah it was it was not not good
[60:10] yeah it was not good so and I realized
[60:12] that probably you're dead in three
[60:13] months and um this was the time I had my
[60:16] YouTube channel for one year I I talked
[60:18] about Bitcoin and other stuff and I
[60:20] realized so what do you want to do if
[60:22] you have three times to live um you want
[60:25] to still stay in your old job and so on
[60:29] I realized no I don't want to and even
[60:30] if I I get um bankrupt in the end
[60:35] because I have no more money or so I I I
[60:37] want to change something I want to live
[60:39] more what I really want to do so I
[60:42] decided to marry my girlfriend Debbie
[60:44] and today we are married for sure and I
[60:47] decided to create a company um based on
[60:50] my YouTube channel blog trainer um and
[60:53] the content uh the bit content and in
[60:57] this time I started to think a lot of my
[61:01] life so I think Co was a part social
[61:04] distancing and so on and I had a lot of
[61:06] time for myself even because of my heart
[61:09] diseases and I had to fight for this I a
[61:12] very high medicine taking pH of a year
[61:17] or so on and I was I I I looked very
[61:19] terrible it was a very hard time but it
[61:22] was a time where I realized who I want
[61:24] to be and um what Bitcoin as a hard
[61:26] money probably brings the society uh or
[61:31] which parts are are are getting worse
[61:35] through Fiat money even our food or what
[61:38] we do in our lifetime or how we spend
[61:40] money and so on and I just realized at
[61:45] this moment okay try to live as there's
[61:48] a Bitcoin standard today so today I I do
[61:52] my own um my my my own noodles for
[61:56] example or so on right I do a lot of
[61:58] sports and um I
[62:00] developed a state where I don't need
[62:03] medicine for all my diseases so I'm
[62:06] still a a ill man but not that much so I
[62:10] feel better than any time before in my
[62:13] life and I'm pretty sure my my uh my
[62:16] lifespan is more than three months now
[62:18] and I I realized that this was all given
[62:22] by myself there's no state which coming
[62:25] to you and says hey or no government
[62:28] which says hey I I will make you healthy
[62:32] or I will give you a marriage or I give
[62:35] you a home so you are the person who can
[62:39] make your life better and Bitcoin is
[62:41] your tool for this and I realized how
[62:44] many things in life are getting worse
[62:47] through Fiat money and I'm the living
[62:50] proof for myself that all these signs we
[62:54] have based on Fiat is just so corrupted
[62:58] or so misleading that they are not it's
[63:03] it's not a signs of Truth today and
[63:05] there's a signs of Truth and my doctor
[63:08] my my so several hospitals were involved
[63:11] in my diseases and uh one from the upper
[63:15] doctors told me because they had no no
[63:17] answer why I'm now so good they they
[63:20] can't explain this by by their methods
[63:22] and he said I don't know but the person
[63:25] with which is healing themselves is in
[63:27] right so yeah that's that's my proof
[63:30] right so uh I don't need more I I just
[63:33] um like to think I just love to have
[63:37] time for myself I I like sometimes to
[63:40] meet other people but not that often I I
[63:43] really enjoy time with myself and with
[63:45] my thoughts and everything uh and and
[63:48] and killing all the noise outside of my
[63:52] head from outside yeah so all the the
[63:56] fear the system is telling us like
[63:59] there's wall there our our our
[64:02] environment is getting destroyed and all
[64:04] this stuff so I can't do anything on
[64:07] this and no one knows the future so why
[64:09] should I fear the future I Don't Fear
[64:11] the Future but I realized as well
[64:14] there's no
[64:15] security probably tomorrow I I will have
[64:18] a car crash and I'm dead so how could I
[64:21] know if this that happen so when there's
[64:23] no security and no fear for the future
[64:25] don't live in in in a false security
[64:28] feeling and don't live in a fear feeling
[64:30] just live and and solve your problems
[64:33] you have now um try to plan for some
[64:36] months or probably a year but realize
[64:40] this is a very FR fragile construct our
[64:43] life is a very fragile construct and
[64:45] what Bitcoin is giving you is you don't
[64:48] give this fragile construct in the hand
[64:50] of a state or a government you give this
[64:53] fragile construct in your own hands and
[64:55] this is the best feeling you can reach
[64:57] and when you if you ask me before I get
[65:01] ill before I get my diseases hey Roman
[65:04] would you like to get very ill and get
[65:07] some diseases I would say oh wow please
[65:09] don't so I I want to be healthy who who
[65:13] said yes but today I think this was the
[65:16] best thing that happen to to me in my
[65:19] whole life because this was the the
[65:22] starting point for this journey where I
[65:25] realized all this stuff and this
[65:27] diseases um were the thing on on which I
[65:32] I realized to getting free for my own
[65:34] life and so I realized there's nothing
[65:39] really bad and nothing really good in
[65:41] life it's always boast and when things
[65:44] are getting worse like Fiat money we
[65:46] create Bitcoin out of this so is Fiat
[65:49] money now bad or good nothing yeah it's
[65:52] just the living process and the thing is
[65:54] that Bitcoin is just fit perfect in the
[65:57] society's living process and you can use
[65:59] this to bring solutions for your own
[66:02] problems and problems are very good
[66:04] because back to my sentence I I uh I
[66:08] spoke out before children who are not
[66:10] allowed to do anything become adults who
[66:12] cannot do anything so please give me
[66:15] problems give me hard times because I
[66:17] know I will rise in this I will be a
[66:21] stronger person after this and I learn
[66:24] how to solve these hard times Bitcoin is
[66:26] my tool for this and this could happen
[66:28] to every human uh living today or living
[66:31] in the future and Bitcoin is this tool
[66:33] for absolute freedom for all of us I
[66:37] love that so much that is so beautiful
[66:39] and by way for for all the people that
[66:41] didn't see uh Roman for the last four
[66:43] years five years on on on his YouTube
[66:45] channel um it's it's tremendous how you
[66:49] look and be more healthy every year like
[66:52] you can really see your transformation
[66:54] and I love that you're documenting that
[66:55] also on YouTube and I just encourage
[66:57] everyone that listens to that one just
[66:59] look quickly on his channels look at
[67:01] like videos four years ago and look at
[67:03] videos now it's it's a it's a massive uh
[67:06] massive massive uh difference and I love
[67:08] I love your your journey a lot really
[67:10] really cool thank you for sharing that
[67:12] with us um thank you so much uh for this
[67:15] words really perfect then uh let's come
[67:18] to the end routine two questions and the
[67:20] first uh question is always the same
[67:22] question what can we learn from you
[67:24] besides all the things that we already
[67:26] talked about yeah in the end it's this
[67:28] what I talked about in the end so um so
[67:32] in the last in the last part um the
[67:35] solution for your problems uh you will
[67:38] find the solution for your problems in
[67:40] yourself no one will tell you what the
[67:42] solution for a problem is and you can
[67:45] try Bitcoin as a tool to to be empowered
[67:50] to create this solution for you I love
[67:54] that a lot and now the end routine the
[67:56] last question of the podcast uh is
[67:58] always coming from the previous guest
[68:00] the previous guest is asking a question
[68:01] for the next guest without knowing who
[68:02] the next guest actually is uh your your
[68:05] last guest I reveal it because it was
[68:08] just yesterday was Max Kaiser and he
[68:10] asked you which will be the next country
[68:12] to doop to adopt Bitcoin no uh in which
[68:17] way like like a legal tender or like a
[68:20] reserve currency or let's say legal
[68:23] tender he did not specific specifi it
[68:26] but I think legal tender is interesting
[68:28] so um okay I need to spec specif specify
[68:33] this again because um like Mele did this
[68:36] in Argentina he said yeah um you can now
[68:39] do contracts and all money you want so
[68:42] this is similar to a legal tender for
[68:44] Bitcoin but it's not real legal Bitcoin
[68:47] legal tender so a real Bitcoin legal
[68:49] tender right so not okay um H that's
[68:55] very hard I could I couldn't tell you
[68:57] because it's it's hard to answer but I'm
[68:59] pretty sure this will be a country with
[69:01] a lot of problems with probably a
[69:06] good um oh what's the word
[69:10] um uh it's um yeah a relationship a good
[69:14] relationship to Salvador or Argentina I
[69:18] think I think so too we be really
[69:19] interesting to to see that whole game
[69:22] out this these are two experiments and
[69:24] people are looking at this and um people
[69:27] are realize more and more uh yeah when
[69:31] someone is elected it's not in two weeks
[69:33] everything is better in two weeks so
[69:35] it's a development over years so yeah
[69:38] Salvador started the Bitcoin strategy
[69:40] years ago three years uh to end of the
[69:45] week three years ago and and um uh
[69:51] Argentina's uh elected mle a few months
[69:56] ago so I think it probably will take one
[69:58] or two years more and then they start to
[70:02] to copy the concepts of this countries
[70:05] and and getting the best out of all the
[70:08] ideas from najib or M probably when when
[70:11] this will work good so we will see it's
[70:13] an
[70:14] experiment thank you so much Roman for
[70:16] for being on my channel for taking the
[70:18] time also thank you so much for everyone
