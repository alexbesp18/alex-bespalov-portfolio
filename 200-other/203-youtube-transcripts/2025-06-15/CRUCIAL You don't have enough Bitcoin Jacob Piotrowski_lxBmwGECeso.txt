[00:00] don't own zero Bitcoin there's one
[00:01] Bitcoin and then there are copycats how
[00:03] can you forbid someone from remembering
[00:05] 12 words our national debt is is too
[00:08] high to maintain you get punished for
[00:10] saving in the feat world how much do you
[00:12] have in Fort Knox I bet it's
[00:14] empty you compin two of my most favorite
[00:17] things like I never mentioned it on the
[00:19] podcast but I am a passionate Walker
[00:21] like I walk almost every day uh if I
[00:24] don't walk it's not a good day like I've
[00:26] started uh start my mornings usually at
[00:29] like 5 six 7 in the morning and start
[00:31] like a half an hour walk or an hour walk
[00:34] and then sometimes even in the afternoon
[00:36] again at twice because I have a little
[00:38] dog and he needs to to get out so I walk
[00:41] on an average I think an hour a day
[00:44] probably I guess this is the time where
[00:46] I like have my earphones in like
[00:48] listening and and educate myself um and
[00:51] Bitcoin I mean I talk every day on the
[00:53] podcast about Bitcoin so this is I think
[00:56] uh everybody knows why I'm passionate
[00:58] about Bitcoin now uh like what a what
[01:01] what my first question is like why did
[01:03] you start this like how was the what was
[01:05] the moment where you're like okay let's
[01:07] let's start talking about Bitcoin and
[01:09] walking like how did this whole idea
[01:13] begin yeah so um you know the the the
[01:17] reason I started that was because I
[01:19] wanted to get out get out of home and
[01:21] and um go for a walk and um um I have to
[01:25] give you a little bit of context to my
[01:26] kind of personal situation basically you
[01:29] know we um
[01:31] uh after covid we moved from London to
[01:33] to Scotland uh we had our first son back
[01:37] in back in London then in Edinburgh we
[01:39] had our second child uh and um obviously
[01:43] know we don't have much support from
[01:45] extended family no grandparents to help
[01:47] with the grandkids so quite overwhelming
[01:50] you know raising two small boys and um
[01:52] what uh like three months in you know my
[01:55] partner and I were kind of looking after
[01:57] the the the the baby and
[02:00] you know three months in I said like
[02:01] okay it's probably the right time to
[02:04] maybe start taking it like taking a
[02:07] little bit you know time off like make
[02:10] it gets easier a little bit um so I said
[02:12] honey you know I I need some some me
[02:14] time a little bit time for myself where
[02:16] I can you know just go and go for a walk
[02:18] just clear my brain uh you know clear my
[02:20] thoughts and uh uh do a little a little
[02:23] walk um nearby so I would just go for a
[02:25] walk you know put on the
[02:27] headphones uh and listen to podcast
[02:29] listen to audiobooks uh and go down the
[02:33] rabbit hole um so you know that's that's
[02:36] that's the beginnings uh and I got super
[02:40] like when I was walking and listening
[02:42] and absorbing all the you know all the
[02:44] content uh and all the knowledge um
[02:46] shared by you know the likes of Jeff boo
[02:48] Gigi and others uh I got super
[02:52] overwhelmed to the point where I said
[02:54] look you know I I know that there isn't
[02:56] much time I have uh I'm just have those
[02:59] two hours per week that I'm kind of you
[03:01] know between job and family that that is
[03:04] for myself so I want to squeeze the most
[03:06] of it and I just said I need to talk to
[03:08] someone about all those things because
[03:10] I'm gonna go crazy if I don't I think
[03:13] this is super important I think I'm like
[03:15] I I might be getting over excited am I
[03:18] the only person like that like are there
[03:20] other people who are also uh getting
[03:22] this and seeing they the what how
[03:24] massively this will change the world and
[03:27] um yeah you know we set up I I set up uh
[03:30] a Meetup page and U one guy came in you
[03:33] know then two guys came in and you know
[03:36] we started for first it was a bit kind
[03:39] of you know weird in a sense that we get
[03:41] together and yeah it's a Meetup but it's
[03:44] it's a walk we're going for a walk and
[03:45] we're going to be talking about Bitcoin
[03:47] yeah Bitcoin we know Bitcoin like you
[03:48] know we we understand Bitcoin it's cool
[03:50] it's really revolutionary why you
[03:52] walking why don't we go to to a pop like
[03:54] well I can't go to the pop first of all
[03:56] secondly I really like walking and I
[03:58] really like you know Ed and BR
[04:00] and the Archer Hill archers Archer seats
[04:03] the hill not very far from here which
[04:06] gives us you know a nice circular um
[04:09] route uh for about you know two hours
[04:12] walk um so perfect to get to know each
[04:16] other have a conversation ask some
[04:17] questions you know and and really really
[04:19] spend the time in in a meaningful way um
[04:22] and that's how it started you know we
[04:24] ever since every Saturday um for over
[04:27] two years now we're we're going on a
[04:28] walk in in a EDB and now also in other
[04:31] places people started doing that I love
[04:33] it I think you already have like over
[04:35] 100 walks or something like that you you
[04:37] said yeah that's right did you get
[04:40] orange build uh before that or like did
[04:43] you actually get Bitcoin while walking
[04:45] in hearing the
[04:46] podcast yeah I you know I I got orange
[04:50] build during Bitcoin walks because in
[04:52] the beginning I was kind of well you
[04:54] know blockchain and tokens and you know
[04:57] all that and so cool so many things
[05:00] shiny things and the new things and blah
[05:02] blah blah but uh pretty quickly so
[05:04] actually you know the I have to admit
[05:06] the first the first two walks were
[05:08] called crypto
[05:11] walk and then and then basically I made
[05:14] my U-turn say okay I get it now you know
[05:17] um and from now on it's it's Bitcoin
[05:19] only yeah it's it's fascinating how
[05:22] people are like Bitcoin only how did
[05:25] this actually how did you came to the
[05:26] conclusion okay it's Bitcoin because for
[05:29] me also it started with Bitcoin then I
[05:32] went into other like ethereum and some
[05:35] other really small shitcoins I don't
[05:36] even want to mention that I wasn't
[05:39] there and and uh then I came back to
[05:43] bitcoin only and then I came I think
[05:46] 2021 is the the the year where I was
[05:48] completely Bitcoin only like not even
[05:50] other assets stuff like that how did you
[05:52] came to the conclusion okay actually it
[05:55] is not a crypto walk it's a Bitcoin walk
[05:57] why focus on on bitcoin only
[06:00] well um I I have to probably give credit
[06:03] to my companions with whom you know we
[06:05] shared knowledge and we exchange ideas
[06:07] and uh um you know I I had my kind of um
[06:13] experiences in the space with with
[06:15] during the the the uh the defi summer
[06:19] you know when people kind of started
[06:21] making crazy money um using different
[06:24] protocols and stuff so um I was kind of
[06:27] still looking into this side and and uh
[06:29] was sidetracked to to things that
[06:31] weren't uh that were basically shitcoins
[06:35] um and um at some point you know I
[06:38] started like U losing money being
[06:41] wrecked on you know any any other other
[06:43] tokens uh that that I had um so you know
[06:47] my initial uh approach was that I
[06:49] thought okay I'm too late for Bitcoin uh
[06:52] I you know maybe there is you know that
[06:54] maybe there are better uh better
[06:56] projects you know better chains more
[06:58] innovative
[07:00] um that was what I was thinking
[07:02] initially uh only to realize that
[07:04] actually now this is you know there's
[07:07] there's one Bitcoin and then there are
[07:08] copycats um with you know staking and
[07:13] pre-mined coins with you know their
[07:16] foundations or departments or companies
[07:19] or where somebody benefits from them
[07:21] directly and that's what makes Bitcoin
[07:24] fundamentally different that it's
[07:25] effectively you know open source like
[07:27] Linux um open soft software uh run by
[07:31] anyone um so in in this sense I got uh
[07:36] very fascinated and uh and I stepped
[07:39] away from from from from all the
[07:41] shitcoin are going around I was very
[07:44] deeply you know involved in some some
[07:46] some um shitcoin projects in the
[07:48] beginning I was passionate and trying to
[07:50] push and be part of community now I'm
[07:52] kind of taking it easy and like like
[07:54] that's that's
[07:55] irrelevant um the only thing that
[07:57] matters is you know the future we're
[07:59] going to be living living in and in that
[08:00] future um Bitcoin is going to stay um
[08:04] and uh it just reminds me now I'm
[08:06] because I'm I'm U I'm a maxi but I still
[08:10] um you know recently one one friend um
[08:12] asked me to comment to to give a talk
[08:14] about Bitcoin haling on something called
[08:17] Scottish blockchain Meetup so there was
[08:19] like you know a block of presentations
[08:21] and people were presenting different
[08:24] projects different tokens and I was
[08:26] sitting there listening you know okay
[08:29] fine you know and and basically he said
[08:31] like you know if you're not going to
[08:32] come to talk about you know Haring and
[08:34] Bitcoin people are not going to like
[08:36] we're not going to do anything we're not
[08:37] going to cover Hing at all so you know
[08:40] take it or leave it and I said do you
[08:42] know what I I really want to like I
[08:43] think you know people should know we
[08:45] should get the awareness
[08:48] out and um and yeah you know there was a
[08:51] guy who was running his like Consulting
[08:54] agency doing uh you know
[08:57] tokenomics architecture whatever
[08:59] whatever he wants to call that uh and
[09:01] there were you know he did his
[09:03] presentation I was kind of sitting there
[09:05] quietly looking at that and you know at
[09:08] some point there is a question from from
[09:09] from the audience so what is the average
[09:14] um
[09:15] uh like shelf life of of a project like
[09:19] how of a token how how on average how
[09:22] long does a token last and they say well
[09:24] you know that depends and they they
[09:26] start making crazy crazy kind of
[09:28] discussion and this point I go like
[09:30] that's that's just ridiculous you know
[09:33] that's I know why I'm here I know why
[09:35] I'm in Bitcoin um and in the you know in
[09:38] my presentation I say well look this is
[09:40] you know the Bitcoin monetary Supply and
[09:42] the distribution that will be released
[09:45] until the year 2,140 so the life you
[09:48] know the the shelf life of Bitcoin token
[09:50] is
[09:51] probably you know higher and longer than
[09:54] than the other tokens and I get you know
[09:57] people people get that people got that
[09:59] uh the in the in the Meetup H it was
[10:01] actually interesting because I had you
[10:02] know very good feedback um and it turns
[10:06] out that you know a [ __ ] coiner event uh
[10:09] turned out to be quite a good place to
[10:12] uh to recruit bitcoiners to recruit
[10:14] people to come to bitcoin walk to you
[10:16] know ask questions uh I you know I it
[10:18] was it was funny because uh on the
[10:22] Saturday the 20th of April was that was
[10:24] like two days after the um that Meetup
[10:27] and I had two guys who came in from that
[10:29] from that from that Meetup um the [ __ ]
[10:31] coiner Meetup and and got orange buildt
[10:34] on you know the first day of the new
[10:35] Epoch so I got like yes winning you know
[10:37] that's that's that's an
[10:39] achievement yeah I think shitcoin is
[10:41] just a Bitcoin who doesn't know it yet
[10:44] so he's
[10:45] like to be orange buil um and the shelf
[10:49] life is also really interesting I never
[10:51] looked at the shelf life of of crypto
[10:53] tokens because I don't care like I know
[10:55] the shelf life of of Bitcoin will be
[10:57] forever so like I don't care shelf lives
[11:00] and also I think it's valuable for
[11:04] bitcoiners to be at those blockchain
[11:06] events like first of all you get the
[11:09] confirmation that everything we are
[11:12] talking is actually true they actually
[11:14] making up really weird excuses for their
[11:17] projects and they're having marketing uh
[11:21] they're doing a good marketing job
[11:22] honestly uh I was at the Recently I
[11:26] think uh I don't know middle of April or
[11:29] beginning of April there was a huge uh
[11:32] blockchain uh um event uh in Paris and
[11:37] short short story like uh like I went to
[11:40] Paris with my girlfriend this was
[11:42] basically a trip there uh and I was also
[11:45] there I was like yeah let's let's let's
[11:47] see check it out and because I have a
[11:48] YouTube channel uh I got free tickets uh
[11:51] and I just went in there and like
[11:53] checking around uh we we got lunch there
[11:56] so my girlfriend was happy also that we
[11:58] got free lunch at the blockchain
[12:00] conference she's also um Frugal than
[12:03] like me so it it it was fascinating to
[12:07] see all those uh like this it was
[12:10] basically a completely [ __ ] coiner event
[12:13] so but but it was really really cool
[12:15] yeah the the lunch you had it wasn't for
[12:17] free you know somebody paid for that
[12:19] somebody paid some tokens you know
[12:21] bought some tokens to some company that
[12:24] allocated that to a marketing department
[12:26] that basically sponsored your lunch you
[12:27] know that's how it happened and [ __ ]
[12:29] coer sponsored my lunch isn't that
[12:33] good um but the the the the bigger
[12:37] question what I wanted to lead up to
[12:38] that is um for me Al like let's take it
[12:43] step back like for me uh there's a lot
[12:46] of things that have a price tag or
[12:48] people are paying a price for something
[12:51] that I don't get for example art like I
[12:54] I don't get how people pay for something
[12:57] especially Modern Art where like this
[12:59] this pictures like like I don't know
[13:00] this could be my some some some
[13:04] five-year-old kid could make this and
[13:05] they're paying $5 million dollar for
[13:07] that like why are they doing that or
[13:10] even the Bitcoin sign we had this thing
[13:12] uh this was also a big controversy is it
[13:14] actually worth that or is it actually a
[13:16] meme like why should not get the Bitcoin
[13:19] instead of that um like like this is the
[13:23] first part of the question the second
[13:24] part would be like is there Place uh
[13:27] where altcoins or [ __ ] coins have a
[13:29] place like is is there value in those uh
[13:33] in in another sense not utility not is
[13:36] not money but could there be a place
[13:38] where like in 50 years that those tokens
[13:40] are still around and still have value I
[13:43] don't think so but I don't know maybe
[13:44] you're you're looking differently I
[13:46] think um you know we are at the point
[13:50] where um the Consciousness around the
[13:53] all all you know all
[13:55] the um all the m Maldo of the Fiat world
[14:01] and you know the need to transition from
[14:03] the Fiat standard to the Bitcoin
[14:05] standard um that's growing and that's
[14:08] going to be a process that will take
[14:10] time and in the process um you know
[14:13] that's what jao Zuko said in in Madera
[14:15] that you know people say that you know
[14:17] there is there is crypto and then
[14:19] Bitcoin is part of it and and he
[14:21] explained that actually it's other way
[14:22] around that there is Bitcoin and then
[14:24] there's Fiat and crypto is part of Fiat
[14:28] um so I think there will be some kind of
[14:31] transition between you know Both Worlds
[14:34] and um some projects some tokenization
[14:37] maybe some real world assets I don't
[14:39] know like some of that will probably you
[14:41] know stay there for couple of years
[14:44] maybe maybe a decade I don't know um but
[14:47] eventually you know it will be Bitcoin
[14:50] that will become a base layer so
[14:52] everything will drop you know will will
[14:53] come to bitcoin and you know maybe at
[14:56] some point there will be a way to to uh
[14:58] to recreate those real world assets if
[15:01] that's still a thing on bitcoin um that
[15:04] that's my take so I think you know for
[15:06] for the shortterm period they're going
[15:09] to stick around um and unfortunately
[15:12] like only you know few few percent of
[15:14] those whatever 15,000 tokens that are
[15:17] out there or 20,000 tokens that are out
[15:19] there uh only a few perent will make it
[15:22] um so you know majority of them will
[15:25] will go to zero uh and people who put
[15:28] their money in there we lose um so um
[15:32] yeah the only you know flight to safety
[15:35] is is
[15:36] Bitcoin that's that's amazing by the way
[15:38] did you see I mean it just came out like
[15:41] last night or today or something like
[15:43] that I did not check it out myself I was
[15:45] just curious if you saw it um the micro
[15:48] strategy orange thing yeah it I just saw
[15:52] it a lot of my my feet but I did not
[15:54] have the time to I saw it yesterday and
[15:56] I started listening to it yesterday
[15:58] evening but I I had to for my iido
[15:59] trading so I I um I ended up not not
[16:02] following up uh yeah but it's happening
[16:05] man I mean like you know sailor is he he
[16:07] walks the talk right so he was you know
[16:08] he he was talking about Bitcoin and
[16:10] doing that and putting uh putting a lot
[16:12] of uh money in there but uh now he's
[16:15] actually putting his you know his
[16:17] company to to to build software that and
[16:20] solutions that will serve other you know
[16:23] other Enterprises to uh to utilize the
[16:25] strengths of Bitcoin so that's that's
[16:27] fantastic I need to watch the whole
[16:28] thing thing because I you know I I just
[16:29] touched that but I love the fact that uh
[16:32] m saor is actually following through uh
[16:35] you know with like he he really does
[16:37] what what he thoughts right so he's
[16:40] going into this and he's changing micro
[16:42] strategy to be a Bitcoin development
[16:44] company yeah and I think we will have so
[16:46] many more um Innovations and we are so
[16:50] early and I think you said before that
[16:52] you thought you are too early uh too too
[16:54] late to bitcoin uh as almost everybody
[16:57] thinks I have Al F in in that way and I
[17:00] thought that for three years that I'm
[17:03] too late and Bitcoin has actually scam
[17:05] so I had this kind of thought in my head
[17:07] with which is contradictory but uh
[17:09] anyways like let's maybe talk to that
[17:12] like why aren't we too late like why is
[17:15] it still so early in Bitcoin where do
[17:17] you see Bitcoin going from an adoption
[17:19] standpoint like where do where do you
[17:22] think we are right now from a a phase of
[17:25] money
[17:27] creation well I think you know uh it's
[17:29] maths right so you know we've got the
[17:31] the Bitcoin formula the the the you know
[17:34] the the formula that dictates how
[17:36] Bitcoin Supply is being released we know
[17:38] it's fixed Supply we know it's this is
[17:40] the ultimate finite scarcity in the
[17:43] digital form in the purest form so there
[17:46] is no other such thing known to
[17:48] man uh that is so scarce um I think now
[17:53] Bitcoin became you know after the Hing
[17:56] became more more scars than even than
[17:58] gold so in terms of uh you know
[18:01] appealing to Austrian economics uh and
[18:03] gold bugs this is now uh more scars than
[18:06] gold um and I think this fact Alone um
[18:11] like Bitcoin doesn't have to do anything
[18:12] you know people are and and the world is
[18:16] complex enough and messed up enough for
[18:20] Bitcoin to succeed anyway like you know
[18:22] you you turn on the news and you hear
[18:24] okay um the Federal Reserve is going to
[18:26] print another 60 billion uh to you know
[18:30] to buy weapons and send them to you know
[18:33] one country they're going to you know
[18:35] print another 25 billion uh and send it
[18:38] to another country and uh you know other
[18:41] other other other governments say yeah
[18:43] we're gonna you know support them as
[18:44] well we're gonna buy some more rockets
[18:46] and whatever and uh and and print that
[18:49] money so you know this is not something
[18:52] like me or you would probably want to
[18:54] spend your money on right um and uh but
[18:58] by by doing so you know by by printing
[19:01] money and spending that on things that
[19:04] are not Humanity doesn't need those
[19:06] things you know we don't need to be at
[19:08] War we don't need we should be living in
[19:10] peace um so in that sense um the
[19:14] geopolitical system is kind of
[19:17] constructed in a way that will make the
[19:20] uh Bitcoin win uh and I you I make a lot
[19:23] of analogies uh to to to different
[19:25] things um I mentioned iido before you
[19:28] know in Aikido you actually use the
[19:30] strength and the the power of your you
[19:32] know the energy of your of your opponent
[19:36] um to to win so like the harder and the
[19:39] stronger and the faster your opponent is
[19:41] the harder they G to fall uh and Bitcoin
[19:44] is like that if you attack it you know
[19:46] even more it's going to grow even more
[19:48] it's been designed this way uh to be
[19:50] super robust and to be unstoppable so
[19:52] there will be attempts to bring it down
[19:54] you know we had National like country
[19:56] level attack from you know China Bunning
[19:58] Bitcoin mining uh and Bitcoin is doing
[20:01] just fine you know there's another
[20:02] attempt now coming from us to you know
[20:05] effectively you know they're aiming
[20:07] going probably to to ban um well try to
[20:09] ban self- custody but that's impossible
[20:12] you cannot how can you ban you know how
[20:15] can you forbid someone from remembering
[20:17] 12 words it's just not not doable so
[20:21] again you know um I always say like
[20:23] whenever you know I talk to someone
[20:25] who's not convinced I say look you don't
[20:27] have to know Bitcoin is option
[20:30] any part it doesn't discriminate so you
[20:31] know anybody any person in the world can
[20:34] you know can own Bitcoin any um company
[20:37] in the world can own Bitcoin any
[20:39] Corporation can own Bitcoin any
[20:41] government can own Bitcoin they don't
[20:43] have to but others might and like if you
[20:48] want to be part of the game of this game
[20:49] theory you just get in if you are
[20:52] listening to this podcast you might be
[20:54] wondering what is actually the setup
[20:56] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[20:58] proove my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[21:00] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[21:02] right source and you have to store
[21:04] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[21:06] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[21:08] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[21:11] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[21:13] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[21:15] own token or something like that be on a
[21:17] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[21:20] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[21:23] for that and now where do you store
[21:26] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[21:28] hardware wallet on a self custody
[21:31] solution where you yourself hold your
[21:33] keys and it should be a Cod wallet so
[21:37] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[21:39] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[21:42] there back up your seat fras and you are
[21:44] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[21:48] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[21:51] it's absolutely must have one last thing
[21:54] before we get back to the video I'm
[21:55] really passionate about meeting other
[21:57] bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[21:59] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[22:03] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[22:06] and biggest Bitcoin only conference in
[22:09] whole of Europe for all Americans please
[22:11] visit Europe and visit this place in
[22:14] June for all europees it's a must go
[22:16] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[22:19] PR conference you basically have to come
[22:21] I will do interviews there and I would
[22:23] love to meet you all there use code
[22:26] Robin for all my sponsors to get get
[22:28] discounts and use the links down in the
[22:31] description more and more people will
[22:33] realize that they actually need Bitcoin
[22:35] uh more than Bitcoin needs them so
[22:37] that's like something that you have to
[22:40] to figure out and I think when when once
[22:43] you get down this orange buing route
[22:45] this this route to getting and educated
[22:47] on bitcoin you figure more and more out
[22:50] that oh like it doesn't matter what what
[22:54] happens to bitcoin like it doesn't
[22:56] matter uh what what my ban or what what
[23:00] states are doing to bitcoin Bitcoin just
[23:02] grows like we from
[23:05] 2013 uh China tries to ban Bitcoin now
[23:08] we have a Hong Kong ETF uh exactly
[23:11] mining is still in the country probably
[23:13] with like 10% or something like that uh
[23:16] so everything uh is good for Bitcoin I
[23:20] think the the main uh example that I
[23:23] always bring up is the example of uh the
[23:27] mining Exodus of of China from 2021
[23:30] where they had like 70% of the
[23:46] [Music]
[23:54] miningspeed they just like put the the
[23:57] the miners and pluged it in somewhere
[23:59] else and it helped decentralizing the
[24:02] whole thing and it was good in the end
[24:03] and it's it's it's fascinating to see
[24:05] and then on the other side we have a
[24:07] highly centralized Fiat system that
[24:09] seems to get worse every year with
[24:12] higher taxes higher inflation and I saw
[24:16] a video today where she was like she was
[24:18] a single M and she was talking six
[24:20] minutes about why she's paying over 50%
[24:23] taxes and cannot even live like she's
[24:25] not like a high earner or something like
[24:27] that she is paying so much taxes when
[24:29] you calculate all the taxes not just
[24:31] your payroll tax in there and then I was
[24:34] like but she forgot to mention one tax
[24:38] inflation then it's like 60 70% tax on
[24:41] your earnings um how long can this go
[24:45] good like how long do you see this this
[24:47] thing going and and and can it go
[24:50] forever no of course not so you know I'm
[24:54] I'm I'm worried about Europe because
[24:57] Europe you know is this is the sort of
[25:00] um aging population living in a in a you
[25:03] know in a wealthy sit like very weal
[25:06] situated very wealthy compared to the
[25:08] rest of the world to the global South
[25:09] for example and because of this uh um of
[25:15] this comfort and the privilege of living
[25:17] in this Society with having you know
[25:20] access to everything uh to you know
[25:22] consumerism that is basically over the
[25:24] board with anything you know he order
[25:26] something with a type of of your phone
[25:29] you get it delivered to your your your
[25:30] house tomorrow um it's it's it's
[25:33] fantastic it's lovely but at the same
[25:35] time we got hooked on this and um we
[25:39] don't realize that there is something
[25:41] that is wrong with that and what is
[25:42] wrong with that is the fact that we're
[25:44] consuming and we're um we're we're
[25:48] living in a society that more and more
[25:51] gets um dependent and uh and hooked to
[25:56] to those those those those things that
[25:58] will not last forever that are not
[25:59] sustainable so you know uh for example
[26:03] UK I'm not sure about Austria but I
[26:04] think you know generally most of most of
[26:06] Europe we have like U social benefits uh
[26:09] you know for for anyone who's not
[26:11] working or not feeling well or whatever
[26:14] um and yeah that helps you know to cover
[26:17] your expenses whatever but at the same
[26:21] time this is the money people get for
[26:22] free and you know Scotland is the kind
[26:24] of country that um has a problem of
[26:29] those benefits in the sense that there
[26:31] are there are now families that through
[26:33] three generations have been living of
[26:35] benefits only so you know there are
[26:38] there are people who are 23 24 25 and
[26:41] who come to you know to special like
[26:44] agencies and say well you know I i' I've
[26:46] got anxiety I can't work you know I you
[26:49] know I've got a depression I I you know
[26:52] what can I get from the government how
[26:53] can government help me and you know they
[26:56] get uh sometimes 300 sometimes 800 it
[27:01] really depends but um this way of living
[27:07] is so deeply embedded in them that
[27:10] basically uh you got a good chunk of
[27:12] society already hooked up and completely
[27:14] dependent on the state so to introduce
[27:17] things like C cbdc Central Bank digital
[27:20] currencies onto them that's a no-brainer
[27:23] that's that's that's super easy like for
[27:25] the government to do you say okay you're
[27:27] going to be getting you're gonna get 10%
[27:29] you know more benefits you just need to
[27:30] switch to this system and we're going to
[27:33] control how you spend your money so you
[27:35] can't you know you can't uh spend it
[27:37] outside of your city you can't spend it
[27:39] on travel you just have to you know buy
[27:42] groceries and that's it you know that's
[27:44] easy doable right uh and I think the
[27:47] inflation and Taxation will kind of keep
[27:50] on growing um and unfortunately this is
[27:53] going to be you know case of following
[27:55] what the US does because right now it
[27:57] seems like uh at least in in UK uh the
[28:00] crypto regulations are or or Bitcoin
[28:02] regulations or you know anything to to
[28:05] to to make that officially legal and
[28:08] recognized is kind of stopped it's you
[28:10] know it's a taboo people don't talk
[28:12] about it it's uh it's this elephant in
[28:14] the room where everybody goes like yeah
[28:16] it goes up it's going to go up forever
[28:17] and you guys are printing money so it's
[28:19] going to go up even more so like it's
[28:21] you don't you don't need to be you know
[28:23] a rocket scientist to understand that
[28:25] and at the same time you know there is
[28:27] all eyes on the United States Federal
[28:29] Reserve what will the sex say um and
[28:33] obviously you know we're going to have
[28:34] the elections in the US so once the
[28:37] administration change is over there's
[28:39] going to be you know a a period I think
[28:42] basically I think right now we're kind
[28:43] of all in a in a in a frozen period
[28:47] where we're waiting for this change over
[28:49] to happen for them to be able to chill a
[28:51] little bit and to um to come up with
[28:55] some you know some some reasonable
[28:57] regulation
[28:58] and I don't know how like how will that
[29:00] go because uh if you know if there's
[29:02] appetite to uh to keep the dollar Alive
[29:05] by all means um well you know that's
[29:10] that's another s like reserve uh Global
[29:13] Reserve currency that that that's you
[29:15] know over the peak right now and it's
[29:17] declining and more and more countries
[29:19] will step away from the dollar and uh
[29:22] they'll need to find another um currency
[29:25] that is um recognized and is tra
[29:29] so you know I don't think that um UK or
[29:32] Austria or any other country would want
[29:34] to trade in um Chinese fanan know I I
[29:38] don't I don't believe this will ever
[29:39] happen uh even though China will will
[29:42] dominate um likely you know will
[29:45] dominate over the economy of the world
[29:47] like it already does technically know if
[29:50] you look around your room how many items
[29:53] in your room have the you know the sign
[29:55] made in China it's you know this is the
[29:57] mental exercise we have to go through
[29:59] like we are very dependent anything you
[30:01] touch and they're like Chinese are super
[30:03] persistent on that they put the ma in
[30:05] China sign everywhere they you know they
[30:07] can so literally you know every like if
[30:09] I if I check the pen I'm holding in it's
[30:11] probably made in China um and um yeah
[30:14] these things will keep on happening um
[30:17] uh until you know us comes to a
[30:19] conclusion when they when they say okay
[30:22] you know our national debth is is too
[30:24] high to maintain um and we need to we
[30:28] need to restore like back back the
[30:30] dollar with something more tangible so
[30:32] you know if they want to trade again on
[30:35] something that other countries want to
[30:37] trade again this will have to be a
[30:39] commodity that is desired recognized and
[30:42] uh and liquid and this will be Bitcoin
[30:45] so I think you know the reserves that um
[30:48] or or you know the Bitcoin that the
[30:49] stack that was confiscated in the United
[30:51] States I don't think they will sell it I
[30:53] think you know they will work closely
[30:55] with the likes of Black Rock Fidelity
[30:56] and you know all the ETF F maybe they
[30:59] will somehow try to you know put their
[31:02] hand on that that stack as well I don't
[31:04] know I don't know how they could do it
[31:06] but you know they got they got all the
[31:07] power to do so right uh and they will
[31:10] use it to you know to to to to stay
[31:12] afloat to stay alive
[31:15] so it's F fascinating for me to see also
[31:18] like when we look at
[31:20] cbdcs uh like kind of an getting those
[31:24] fear a little bit longer in because they
[31:26] have a little bit more control but at
[31:28] the same time if they have more control
[31:30] they will manipulate more they will mess
[31:32] up more I
[31:34] think and and it introduces a digital
[31:38] wallet which tells the whole world the
[31:42] government is saying something digital
[31:44] has value and why does then Bitcoin has
[31:47] no value and then everybody has a
[31:49] digital wallet and they're like ah okay
[31:51] this thing is losing purchasing power
[31:54] over time and this thing is gaining
[31:56] purchasing power like wow like I I see a
[31:58] lot of arguments made for the cbdcs is
[32:01] kind of a trojan horse for
[32:03] Bitcoin uh and and and having it
[32:07] introduced to bitcoin but in the end of
[32:09] the day it's doesn't really matter how
[32:11] is actually I follow a little bit of the
[32:14] cbdcs for the European Union what's the
[32:17] Euro doing uh is there anything
[32:19] different because of the brexit in the
[32:21] UK like is there are there similar plans
[32:24] for cbdcs in the UK well there is the
[32:27] britcoin or the you know the digital
[32:30] pound as they call it uh that they want
[32:33] to introduce at some point um and they I
[32:37] heard that I think 2026 they plan to
[32:40] roll this out maybe I'm wrong I'm not
[32:42] sure here um you know of course they
[32:44] will try they will keep on trying they
[32:46] they you know out of all the countries
[32:49] UK is the you know this is the financial
[32:50] Hub it's always has been a financial one
[32:52] of the financial hubs in the world um
[32:55] and uh they've always managed and and
[32:58] and you know played the money game uh to
[33:02] their advantage in terms of you know uh
[33:05] Canon effect I don't think there's any
[33:07] other country where this is more visible
[33:09] than in UK where you have the elites the
[33:12] elites of you know of the country and
[33:13] and people working for the banks taking
[33:17] crazy bonuses every year you know in
[33:19] hundreds of millions of pounds um you
[33:22] know as as a bonus to their salary like
[33:25] okay well what where's that coming from
[33:27] you know why why why would people need
[33:29] to pay uh those guys to to you know to
[33:32] get rich you know to some CEO of a bank
[33:35] I don't I don't recognize any particular
[33:36] you know value that these people are
[33:38] providing to my life you know uh and so
[33:42] they're close to the power they're close
[33:44] to the elites they're close to the money
[33:46] printer and they benefit from that um so
[33:50] uh in the same kind of mindset they will
[33:54] try to be close to and and impose the
[33:56] cbdcs because for them this is the
[33:59] Continuum they this way they will be
[34:01] able to keep getting richer while the
[34:03] poor getting you know staying at Bay
[34:06] keeping them low down um whereas Bitcoin
[34:08] kind of flips that over because you know
[34:10] if you're if you're a bitcoiner you
[34:13] understand that okay you have you have
[34:14] to stay humble and uh I really like the
[34:17] stuff that Jack said in Madera that you
[34:19] know Bitcoin is not the tool that uh
[34:22] will allow you to get rich quick but it
[34:25] will allow you not to get get poor
[34:29] slowly uh so basically you know if
[34:32] you're if you're like whatever your
[34:34] income might be this is the the biggest
[34:37] Mis misconception like you know if
[34:38] you're if you're working in McDonald's
[34:40] or if you're you know if you're working
[34:42] on the minimal salary um that allows you
[34:45] to survive you know from the F from the
[34:47] first till the end and you know end to
[34:49] end from month to month um and you're if
[34:51] you're able to uh to squeeze you know 20
[34:54] euros from that or 20 pounds from that
[34:56] put that in Bitcoin thank yourself that
[34:58] you did that and kind of keep on doing
[35:01] that with determination and keep on you
[35:03] know trying to to increase that as you
[35:06] go uh because this is something that
[35:08] will not be that will not Escape if you
[35:11] got 20 EUR that you want to put you know
[35:13] in on your shelf or in your piggy bank
[35:16] um that's ridiculous because that's that
[35:18] money is going to you know keep on
[35:19] dropping it in value from from month to
[35:22] month um so I would you know encourage
[35:25] everybody to kind of start exploring
[35:27] that
[35:28] and one one thing that I you know I I
[35:30] always uh find um fascinating when I
[35:33] meet someone new to bitcoin is that they
[35:35] think that oh you know there's so much
[35:36] to learn they're overwhelmed and yeah
[35:39] there is a lot to learn but I encourage
[35:41] everyone to start slowly but start get
[35:44] started and then start learning so don't
[35:46] procrastinate on starting your you know
[35:48] stacking SS just take it off you know
[35:52] you're like worst thing that's going to
[35:54] that's going to happen is you lose your
[35:55] seat phrase or you mess up something in
[35:57] you lose your 20 EUR it's very unlikely
[36:00] you will it will happen to you but this
[36:02] is literally the worst thing that could
[36:03] happen in the beginning and the more you
[36:05] like the more uh the earlier you start
[36:08] with stacking and investing well
[36:09] investing putting your money in Bitcoin
[36:11] your wealth in Bitcoin the more
[36:12] motivated you become to actually absorb
[36:14] knowledge and to learn best practices
[36:16] and to develop your mindset around
[36:18] Bitcoin so um in in terms of order uh
[36:23] start doing and learning doing and
[36:25] learning doing and learning there's a
[36:26] repetition to it you know there's
[36:28] there's a cycle to it that's how I think
[36:30] about it Ah that's uh really really cool
[36:33] because once you get into the Habit also
[36:35] of saving money and you get rewarded for
[36:38] the saving this is the big part because
[36:40] usually if you save money you don't get
[36:42] rewarded you get punished for saving in
[36:44] the feat world when you all of the
[36:46] sudden get rewarded for saving this
[36:49] completely changes the game and your
[36:50] mindset also in the head I have one last
[36:53] question on the on the on the brexit
[36:55] thing uh and bitcoiners are usually not
[36:58] as like not really focusing political uh
[37:03] politicians too much I got really out of
[37:06] like I was really into politics before
[37:08] Bitcoin and now I'm really out of
[37:11] politics and I try to very Sim very
[37:13] similar story with me that resonates
[37:15] keep me distance from from it but as
[37:19] just a Bitcoin as someone that observes
[37:22] uh Britain and and probably also a
[37:23] little bit the the the European Union
[37:25] still uh do are you you happy with the
[37:28] brexit uh do you think this this is a
[37:31] trend that will continue or do you want
[37:33] to be back in the European
[37:35] Union well you know I'm I'm polish
[37:37] myself originally so I grew up in Poland
[37:41] uh my aspiration was to go west right to
[37:43] like when I was when I was a kid uh we
[37:46] would listen to you know to to to uh all
[37:49] the music coming from Great Britain and
[37:51] you know everything coming from the West
[37:53] so so this was the inspiration so in
[37:55] terms of uh growing up in that part of
[37:58] of of Europe you always look to to the
[38:01] west to to be part of the EUR like
[38:03] Europe European Union this was a dream
[38:05] so like I can't imagine leaving European
[38:07] Union you know like I'm not happy with
[38:09] that I'm off you know that's ridiculous
[38:11] and I think a lot of Brits right now
[38:13] regret that uh UK has exited uh uh
[38:17] European Union some of them were hopeful
[38:21] that maybe this gives a little more
[38:22] freedom for UK to actually be more agile
[38:25] more you know versatile and adapt some
[38:29] um some laws or create some laws that
[38:31] would be preferential to for example
[38:34] Bitcoin um but it didn't instead it did
[38:37] the opposite so it kind of went
[38:40] completely wrong direction and uh I'm
[38:43] pretty sure that within next decade
[38:46] maybe two decades tops there will be
[38:48] conversations uh in UK about Britain
[38:51] rejoining European Union if if they
[38:53] won't be already committed to to to
[38:55] rejoin at much higher price of course in
[38:57] this this would cost the British economy
[38:59] much much much more than than uh what
[39:02] they what they were doing um by leaving
[39:04] UK you Le yeah it'll be really
[39:08] interesting I think the European
[39:09] elections are also really close I don't
[39:12] follow it too much but uh will be I will
[39:14] watch the results afterwards it will be
[39:17] interesting to see uh if they talk about
[39:19] Bitcoin at all and I know in America
[39:21] there was a debate where uh Trump was
[39:25] asked about Bitcoin and and the
[39:28] candidates were ask about Bitcoin uh but
[39:31] as I said I don't watch politic politics
[39:33] too much and I think it's healthy one
[39:36] it's interesting it's it's interesting
[39:38] you bring this up because you know it's
[39:40] like you've got we've got you know the
[39:41] biggest democracy we we know right
[39:43] United States and like pretty much all
[39:46] the
[39:47] candidates for the presidential seat
[39:50] already you know Bitcoin is part of the
[39:51] agenda for the debate already it's
[39:53] already on the agenda in
[39:55] 2024 so
[39:58] uh fine you know we may get one of the
[40:00] old guys Biden Trump whatever I couldn't
[40:03] care less um I mean it's a shame that
[40:05] you know we've got such a big country
[40:07] that also was so inspirational to you
[40:09] know to to many people like myself
[40:11] probably yourself as well you know the
[40:12] American dream and all that you know and
[40:14] and and uh all the good things that came
[40:16] from us um and today we're kind of still
[40:20] living in in you know ruled by two guys
[40:23] from the old era from you know from the
[40:27] long ago that should be they should be
[40:29] you know retiring and just enjoying
[40:31] themselves doing stuff they don't
[40:33] understand technology they don't
[40:35] understand what you know the guy in in N
[40:38] bu in Salvador is doing um and uh they
[40:42] you know there is no way to attract any
[40:45] sort of free Spirits or you
[40:48] know human capital uh to to to us right
[40:52] now uh they got super high like very
[40:55] high taxes uh their geopolitical stance
[40:59] is also very kind of shaky you know
[41:01] they're trying to to to to to remain the
[41:04] hegemon of the world um you know the
[41:07] recent news showed that how massively
[41:10] influential um the Israeli minority or
[41:14] majority I should say probably is in the
[41:16] United States actually I I checked it on
[41:18] Wikipedia the other day and it seems
[41:21] that um from all the Jewish people in
[41:23] the world 50% live in United States
[41:28] uh so there's more people more Jewish
[41:30] people in United States than in Israel
[41:32] just you know just just just a picture
[41:34] right and it's it's sad to see what's
[41:37] going on in the world man I mean like I
[41:39] wish you know that Bitcoin could come up
[41:41] with a solution how B Bitcoin fixes that
[41:43] it's probably too early for this uh but
[41:47] you know we'll see you mentioned El
[41:49] Salvador is that the new American Dream
[41:52] yeah instead of americ new American
[41:54] Dream you've got the the the Savior
[41:56] right that that's the trans
[41:58] ation uh of El Salvador the one who
[42:01] saves um and and I think you know it's
[42:05] phenomenal what you know what uh the
[42:07] country is doing in uh on many levels
[42:10] but you know one example is the fact
[42:12] that part of the country's National
[42:14] Reserve is held in Bitcoin and the
[42:17] address of the wallet has been published
[42:20] so in this sense I think this is you
[42:22] know uh like a historical event where
[42:25] you know a country says okay this is you
[42:28] know I've got more but this is this is
[42:29] how much I got here's my proof and uh
[42:33] the consequences of that are that you
[42:35] know you can like night Bella can go to
[42:37] to uh to Joe Biden and say how much do
[42:40] you have in Fort Knox I bet it's empty
[42:43] like I I don't think there's anything I
[42:44] I think I don't think you have as much
[42:45] as you say you have right because like
[42:49] what it's it's you know it's a secret
[42:51] what what the hell you know uh this is
[42:54] this is not being transparent and El
[42:56] Salvador said the pr for the world for
[42:58] the countries and leaders to say okay
[43:00] you know this is how we're going to to
[43:02] to be honest with our people and honest
[43:04] with uh people from around the world and
[43:06] attract them to come to welcome them in
[43:08] in in El Salvador to uh you know to come
[43:11] and start their families their lives
[43:13] over there um because we want to be a
[43:16] transparent
[43:18] country I love it uh and uh I think El
[43:22] salv I interviewed already like 10
[43:25] people or so from from from there that
[43:27] are either moved back to El Salvador or
[43:30] moved there to El Salvador and came from
[43:32] another country or are just living there
[43:35] for for a long time there grew up there
[43:38] and it's it's fascinating to see how
[43:40] everybody's kind of like yes this is
[43:42] happening we are still like elar is
[43:45] still not like extremely developed and
[43:47] this every is flourishing like we are
[43:49] still not there yet with elar but the
[43:52] the beginning is there like they went
[43:54] from one of the worst countries to be
[43:57] in just 2020 to be an aspirational
[44:01] really cool country to be in for
[44:04] talented and skilled people that can
[44:07] provide a lot of value so that's that's
[44:09] that's amazing and I will follow that
[44:11] story of Sala very closely I hope I can
[44:14] be there this year for for at least a
[44:16] month or something like that to to see
[44:18] it firsthand because till now I only
[44:20] have stories from that uh I would love
[44:23] to be there also uh but let's come uh
[44:26] for a moment back back to walking
[44:27] because this is really interesting for
[44:29] me and I'm a firm believer that walking
[44:32] does something with your brain uh how
[44:35] how do you think walking Alters or
[44:38] enhances uh your way of thinking and did
[44:41] you have some some personal experience
[44:43] with with that where like oh when I work
[44:45] actually the best ideas come from that
[44:47] or something like that yeah it's a great
[44:50] question it's you know it's it's uh it's
[44:53] a phenomenal um Revelation or EP if you
[44:57] like that you know you can meet together
[45:01] and you know when you're going to a
[45:04] Meetup let say Bitcoin Meetup you know
[45:05] in the pop and you're sitting opposite
[45:09] someone in a you know by the table
[45:12] stationary position and you're having a
[45:13] conversation you know back and forth
[45:16] it's always me telling you something you
[45:18] telling me something and you know it's
[45:21] it's it's it's a energy struggle this is
[45:24] you know me imposing things do you agree
[45:26] with that do you agree with that it's
[45:28] back and forth um and no matter how good
[45:31] friends we might be uh there's going to
[45:34] be always a little bit of judgment a
[45:35] little bit of ego and a little bit of
[45:37] this you know back and forth in terms of
[45:39] who's right or who's wrong or this kind
[45:42] of thing I mean that just happens
[45:44] whereas when you're walking ahead when
[45:48] you're just just walking you're focusing
[45:52] on your next step you're focusing in
[45:55] your on on the road ahead you're
[45:56] focusing on the horizon what you see
[45:59] your blood circulation is completely
[46:01] different so your mind your brain
[46:02] functions differently you're being more
[46:05] open-minded and this creates a
[46:09] perfect judge almost judgment free
[46:11] environment for a conversation with
[46:13] someone walking next to
[46:15] you so you like you absorb knowledge
[46:19] you're more open to new ideas you're you
[46:23] know there is no need for uh small talk
[46:26] for um there's no need for a pause it's
[46:30] perfectly fine to you know to walk
[46:31] together for a couple of minutes and not
[46:32] say anything and then you just pop in
[46:34] say Hey you heard about this one and and
[46:37] you know you you keep on developing
[46:39] those you know those those conversations
[46:41] and and you know another great aspect is
[46:43] that you know when you're when you're
[46:45] when you're walking and talking in a
[46:47] group it's very easy to mingle as well
[46:50] to change who you're working with and to
[46:53] like my per from my personal experience
[46:55] I learned most about Bitcoin by not
[46:58] talking at all I was just listening to
[47:00] other people talk and this is the real
[47:03] the real you know Game Changer where
[47:05] you're just you know somebody pops a
[47:08] question like oh that's an interesting
[47:09] one I haven't thought of that and you
[47:11] just follow the conversation you may
[47:13] want to you know chip in and ask some
[47:14] additional questions but um it's it's
[47:17] really great format to um to learn um to
[47:21] learn about Bitcoin and I think what's
[47:23] even more important is that you know it
[47:25] it requires and again there's there's a
[47:27] lot of analogies to um to martial arts
[47:31] where you need to uh get better with
[47:34] practice and practice needs to be
[47:35] regular you need to have the discipline
[47:37] to keep on doing keep on repeating these
[47:39] things there's
[47:41] um there's this Japanese framework
[47:44] called uh
[47:45] shuhari I'm not sure if you heard of
[47:48] this but it's basically a a freestep
[47:50] journey to um to become a master uh and
[47:54] uh what it means is in you know in the
[47:56] first stage in the stage called Sho you
[47:59] kind of follow the rule you follow what
[48:02] they the sense they send by your you
[48:04] know your teacher tells you you don't
[48:06] question why you do this the simple
[48:08] exercise over and over and over again
[48:10] just kind of keep on doing that uh you
[48:13] follow the
[48:14] rule um then when you're ready um you
[48:18] can go to the next stage which is ha and
[48:22] in in sh ha in ha you're able to you're
[48:26] you're owed to break the rule so you
[48:29] follow the rule and you just you break
[48:31] the rule you consciously do something
[48:34] different because you know the rule
[48:36] already you know the rule you know the
[48:38] basics the foundations so it's very easy
[48:40] for you to do something differently and
[48:42] then come back to how it should be done
[48:44] by the by you know the best practice um
[48:47] so um in in in the H in second stage
[48:50] you're able to you you you break the
[48:53] rule and in the third stage you
[48:55] transcend
[48:57] to you know you're the master of
[49:00] Foundations you've done a lot of rule
[49:03] breaking and you transcend and you
[49:04] become the rule so you're freestyling
[49:06] you go with the flow and you're
[49:08] confident because whenever you feel like
[49:11] oh I made a mistake you just go back to
[49:13] basics and you repeat and you repeat and
[49:16] you repeat and for this repetition
[49:18] process uh you build a muscle memory
[49:21] that helps you uh become a master in you
[49:23] know any martial arts be aido or
[49:25] Jiu-Jitsu whatever it is is uh you you
[49:28] become uh you know better you become
[49:31] master um and it's very similar in in
[49:34] Bitcoin where you still have to kind of
[49:36] you know learn those things and discover
[49:38] new layers and consequences of you know
[49:40] why this is important you know example I
[49:43] you know I my background academic
[49:45] background is you know I got my masters
[49:47] um from the warso school of economics
[49:51] and um when I got my masters I finished
[49:54] the uni I guarantee that you know three
[49:56] months after I graduated there was like
[49:59] I my level of knowledge about economics
[50:01] was non-existent I I know nothing about
[50:04] economics um I started learning
[50:07] economies because of Bitcoin and you
[50:10] know through this this process and this
[50:12] kind of rabbit hole that got me in I
[50:14] tend to connect the dots and understand
[50:16] you know the like the logic of Austrian
[50:18] economics the games that what's
[50:21] happening in geopolitics and the
[50:22] consequences of certain certain actions
[50:25] um and but again that comes with time
[50:27] and and with some time spent on on you
[50:31] know proof of work
[50:33] basically amazing and I think walking I
[50:37] love the how was it shua and what was
[50:39] the third part shuhari shuhari uh I love
[50:43] that so much uh and I already um saw
[50:48] that with podcasting uh because you are
[50:51] my 109th guest uh and I'm doing it every
[50:55] day so with practice I noticed I'm
[50:58] getting so much better in preparing for
[51:02] the interview I needed for my first
[51:04] interview I needed like two hours to
[51:06] research get the uh questions and stuff
[51:09] like that and now uh I don't do like I
[51:13] usually do like 30 to 40 minutes of
[51:15] preparation where I'm like watching
[51:17] videos diving into websites whatever is
[51:20] there from from the guest but sometimes
[51:23] I think it was like a week or two ago I
[51:26] did not have any time to prepare like
[51:28] any because I overlooked the appointment
[51:31] you become Transcendent and you become
[51:32] the master exactly and I was like five
[51:36] minutes before I got like a notification
[51:38] to like get in the in the meeting uh
[51:40] from Google Calendar and I was like what
[51:43] meeting and I was like oh [ __ ] and I was
[51:46] like okay let's try it like I I want to
[51:47] be respectful of his time and I don't
[51:50] want to postpone it like three minutes
[51:52] before and I was just getting in there
[51:54] and trying to to get this point across
[51:57] uh and it was one of the best podcasts
[51:59] for me because I already had so many
[52:01] preparations for so many other guests
[52:03] and there I recognize patterns and stuff
[52:05] like that so obviously it's better to
[52:07] prepare like obviously I'm trying to
[52:09] always like 30 to 30 minutes to one hour
[52:11] to prepare for the podcast but I now saw
[52:14] because I broke the rule uh and I saw
[52:17] that it's even good with freestyling as
[52:20] you said I can do it and this is a I
[52:23] mean it has U um indirectly only
[52:26] something to do with Bitcoin but I love
[52:28] having those those those discussions and
[52:30] those inducing FS also about that um do
[52:33] you do uh when when you walk is there
[52:35] anything more to walking do you have any
[52:37] program or do like is is when you do
[52:40] those walks are there sometimes like
[52:42] guest speakers or like have you any
[52:44] stations or like push-ups every 20
[52:48] minutes or like do you have any problems
[52:51] we don't do push-ups uh you know guests
[52:55] we sometimes we we get uh someone who
[52:57] would be kind of you know joining us and
[52:59] maybe uh bringing something new to to uh
[53:02] to the group but we generally stay you
[53:04] know very kind of peer oriented so there
[53:06] is no Koke there's no such thing as
[53:08] following the lead there's no leader uh
[53:10] and um we have a one little ritual that
[53:13] we do and that's again something I I I
[53:16] brought with me from um from from the
[53:19] yeara I spent in Japan uh it's you know
[53:22] Japanese people love taking Family
[53:24] Photos like you know I I used to study
[53:26] with my my my my team back in Nagoya
[53:28] University and wherever we went for an
[53:31] Excursion or a trip uh uh you know they
[53:34] would always have to be documentation of
[53:35] you know of the family pictures
[53:37] everybody standing together and we have
[53:38] a picture so I thought like okay it
[53:40] would be pretty kind of cool to to to do
[53:42] a proof of walk picture uh and uh every
[53:46] time we go for a walk we take a proof of
[53:48] walk picture um and you know we respect
[53:52] everybody's privacy so you know you can
[53:54] uh cover your face you can uh some
[53:56] sometimes people stand backwards in the
[53:57] picture which looks a bit funny uh but
[54:00] you know we have a head count and I have
[54:02] a little um we have a little chart on
[54:04] the website basically showing the
[54:06] numbers of PE attendees every Saturday
[54:09] uh and now we've got new chapters like
[54:11] new people New Towns new cities uh
[54:14] joining so we have walks in U around 15
[54:17] cities that are registered they don't
[54:19] happen very like you know every every
[54:20] Saturday as we as we do it in inbra but
[54:23] uh there's some numbers and we have some
[54:25] proof of walks uh uh on you know on
[54:28] popping up on on Noster and on on on
[54:31] Twitter as well so uh the hashtag proof
[54:34] of walk you know you can see a lot of if
[54:35] you see any people there these are the
[54:37] people who are doing Bitcoin walk
[54:40] um I love it Saturday somewhere in the
[54:42] world I I love that I'm I'm thinking of
[54:46] staring my own proof of work uh group in
[54:49] Austria let's see is there is there in
[54:50] Austria do you know of a group in
[54:52] Austria sorry is do do you know of a
[54:54] proof of walk group in Austria
[54:57] already uh I don't no so yeah I think
[55:00] you can you can you can start one I'm
[55:02] sure there will be you know a lot of
[55:03] people who are doing that actually I
[55:05] have to I have to give credit to to um I
[55:08] think he's Austrian actually is is Gigi
[55:10] Austrian or is he German he's from
[55:12] Germany German okay so but basically um
[55:15] I know that he's he's like he started a
[55:17] website called uh pleb walks.com
[55:21] uh and I you know he's he's doing a lot
[55:25] of things um so I kind of you know I I
[55:28] started Bitcoin not knowing about the
[55:30] thing so then I started kind of you know
[55:33] getting up to speed and understanding
[55:34] what he was trying to do and I think uh
[55:36] well at some point you I I spoke to him
[55:38] on on on Noster and he suggested that
[55:40] maybe I I'll be interested in taking
[55:41] over the maintenance of of this ple
[55:43] Works uh page um so I still don't know
[55:46] how exactly you know best way to to take
[55:48] it over I think from from marketing
[55:51] perspective maybe centralization here is
[55:55] is going to be beneficial um so may
[55:58] maybe we'll do something I I still
[55:59] haven't figured that out um but you know
[56:02] we'll see like right now you know we've
[56:03] got Bitcoin walk uh as a very kind of
[56:07] open you know telling the story um and
[56:09] and also you know the domain Bitcoin
[56:11] walk.org
[56:12] it's very similar to bitcointalk.org one
[56:16] of the first forums where Satoshi was
[56:18] know discussing Bitcoin so when you walk
[56:21] the talk you're kind of you know it's
[56:23] just one letter difference in the domain
[56:24] and it translates the cyber punks to to
[56:27] what we do today which is also a nice
[56:29] tribute um so uh yeah you know uh it's
[56:34] very easy to set up your your uh your
[56:36] chapter of Bitcoin walk wherever you are
[56:39] um if you come to bitcoin walk.org there
[56:41] is a you know a link over there uh we
[56:43] can help you set up you know your page
[56:45] uh for your walk where you define the
[56:47] location the time and whatever you want
[56:49] to say on the page really uh and and
[56:51] then just let it you know share it with
[56:53] your with your crowd uh if people want
[56:55] to come brilliant in that that's awesome
[56:57] we're doing another cool thing that um
[57:00] that I think uh people will like uh is
[57:03] basically whenever we uh we take a
[57:05] family photo like we want to make sure
[57:07] that we're we're all like we we got the
[57:09] highest head count we can get so we get
[57:10] everybody who comes to the Bitcoin walk
[57:12] so we always ask like if there's
[57:14] somebody passing by we ask them to take
[57:16] the picture uh and um like instead of
[57:20] say cheese or say smile we say everybody
[57:22] say Satoshi uh so we kind of you're
[57:25] shouting that out loud uh which is you
[57:28] know a nice nice Tradition now and uh we
[57:31] also like recently we made a flag uh the
[57:34] first version of a flag which is just
[57:36] basically Bitcoin walk you know every
[57:38] sat um walk they talk with Bitcoin walk
[57:42] uh and I'm making a new uh a new flag
[57:44] new addition you know of the flag the
[57:46] iteration of the flag I should say which
[57:48] will basically say don't own zero
[57:51] Bitcoin so anybody who will will ask to
[57:54] take a picture will see hey don't on
[57:56] zero Bitcoin like hm is
[57:59] that basically a little a little bit of
[58:02] prank on the pro I mean not a prank but
[58:04] a message to the person taking it maybe
[58:06] it will you know anchor something in
[58:07] their in their head as well to to to
[58:09] study Bitcoin and this is where like
[58:12] when you get out and you walk and you
[58:15] talk with bitcoiners uh then you might
[58:18] meet new people like there might be
[58:19] someone listening uh and this is
[58:22] something really really great because we
[58:24] have to get out and we have to be
[58:26] present um not only online I think
[58:28] online uh we're getting better and
[58:30] better still we need more people sharing
[58:32] the F but we also have to be offline in
[58:35] wherever the people are so I've got I've
[58:37] got a thesis or or you know a an opinion
[58:41] that's I think might prove right in in
[58:44] the next you know months and years um
[58:47] basically you know with the amount of
[58:50] fud and noise coming from you know
[58:53] social media mainstream propaganda
[58:56] um now we've got AI fakes so it's really
[59:00] hard for someone who's new into Bitcoin
[59:02] to kind of digest and filter out what is
[59:06] real what is not um and uh there is more
[59:09] and more people who basically want to
[59:11] talk to some real person in real life to
[59:14] make sure that they're not getting you
[59:16] know scammed because there might be a
[59:18] situation where somebody I don't know
[59:19] inherits you know a bunch of money from
[59:21] you know grandparents whatever and they
[59:24] want to put it in something and they
[59:26] they somebody tells them about Bitcoin
[59:27] and they don't know anything about that
[59:29] so they want to validate they want to
[59:31] learn and validate and maybe ask some
[59:33] questions um so you know Bitcoin work is
[59:36] a great format and place to to to come
[59:38] by and ask those questions you know we
[59:40] will never we will never like we have a
[59:42] little Manifesto on the website um that
[59:45] basically says you know uh all the kind
[59:47] of best practices and we will never help
[59:49] you set up your wallet for you you know
[59:51] that's not what we're going to do uh but
[59:54] you you know we'll point you in the
[59:55] right direction we'll tell you know
[59:56] maybe try this wallet or you know use a
[59:58] hardware wallet well we can talk about
[60:01] you know multis sick we can talk about
[60:03] whatever you like you like but still
[60:05] bearing in mind that you know privacy
[60:06] and and security is is is on top of the
[60:10] list all very cool it's uh Bitcoin
[60:13] groups are always great and they always
[60:15] keep like privacy and and protecting the
[60:18] individual um in mind and this is is
[60:21] great and before we get to our end
[60:23] routine um do you have some story of one
[60:28] Bitcoin walk or like a an and talk that
[60:30] you had on a Bitcoin walk that you can
[60:32] share was like really cool story some
[60:35] something that stand out from those uh
[60:38] hundreds of walks there is there there
[60:40] is a lot uh but
[60:43] um um I think one that's okay I'll tell
[60:46] you the reason I got I got two or three
[60:48] that that top of my my my my my head
[60:50] right now but uh the last one was
[60:53] actually something from from a friend uh
[60:55] uh who's like a regular Bitcoin Walker
[60:57] here here in Edinburgh and he said like
[61:00] okay guys you know we're over the Hing I
[61:01] have to say you know this Epoch this
[61:03] bare Market was much easier because of
[61:05] Bitcoin because there are other people I
[61:06] could kind of on a regular basis go
[61:08] through this and you know have those
[61:10] conversation then we kind of established
[61:12] that you know Bitcoin walk is not only
[61:15] the most secure computer network out
[61:18] there but it's also the strongest and
[61:21] the best support network in terms of
[61:24] people you can surround yourself with
[61:26] with and people who will push you and
[61:28] and pull you where were necessary so uh
[61:31] in this sense you know I'm I'm grateful
[61:32] to have developed all the friendships
[61:35] with all the people I met um and uh I
[61:38] encourage everybody to try it out you
[61:39] know I think it's it's great for meeting
[61:41] people it's great for you know being out
[61:43] there being away from the screen away
[61:45] from the blue light in the sunlight
[61:47] ideally you know sometimes in Scotland
[61:49] we we're we're not always that
[61:51] luy uh but it's it's a great thing that
[61:54] you can do wherever you are and I'm
[61:55] hoping that you know one day Bitcoin
[61:57] walk will uh will be a ritual that
[62:00] people will exercise you know like with
[62:02] religion I don't want to be making crazy
[62:03] comparisons here but you know uh church
[62:06] has is using has been using very kind of
[62:08] effective methodologies to keep their
[62:10] crowd in right to enforce the beliefs to
[62:14] uh to build on top of that and they have
[62:15] Sunday masses they bring to get people
[62:17] together so we don't have Sunday masses
[62:19] uh instead every sat every Saturday uh
[62:23] or every thousand blocks
[62:26] uh because you know if you look into it
[62:28] if difficulty adjustment is you know
[62:30] 2016 blocks and that's every two weeks
[62:33] then half of it is like 108 right and
[62:38] I'm your 109 guest as
[62:41] well so basically you know those those
[62:44] that that that's eight nine 10 blocks
[62:46] this is the time we spend on the walk so
[62:48] I say every thousand blocks we go for a
[62:52] walk every Saturday we go for a walk
[62:54] history makes this perfect circle
[62:56] 109 guess not thousand but almost yeah
[63:01] yeah um we having the end I think I will
[63:04] be when will I be at the Thousand I will
[63:07] do 300 yeah end of next year maybe
[63:10] beginning of uh uh next to next year
[63:12] let's let's see how how fast I am there
[63:14] I try to do it every day but you're
[63:17] totally right like it's really cool to
[63:18] have those things and Bitcoin as are
[63:20] also really good in in having a great
[63:23] Community there are so many great
[63:24] meetups as you say walks uh conferences
[63:28] I I love meeting just people like just
[63:32] Bitcoin is in real life it's it's really
[63:34] really cool uhor do you have something
[63:37] wrong I just wanted to chip in because
[63:40] you know um we came up that on on our
[63:42] 100th walk that you know we need to do
[63:44] something we need to celebrate it
[63:45] somehow so we we came up with uh a
[63:49] really really hard challenge like super
[63:51] hard challenge we call it 21 SS
[63:54] challenge uh and basically that's 21
[63:56] Saturdays so go for a walk 20 21 times
[63:58] in a year um keep on doing that you know
[64:01] and like it you know if you're doing
[64:03] that first time and you're in a location
[64:06] with people who haven't done Bitcoin
[64:07] work and you're just meeting for the
[64:08] first
[64:09] time um sometimes it might
[64:12] be somewhat awkward if you don't have
[64:15] someone who will you know lead the
[64:17] conversations and start a conversation
[64:19] and I always say like you know like keep
[64:21] it private you don't have to be you know
[64:22] revealing your information about
[64:24] yourself uh you can you can stay
[64:26] Anonymous you can you don't have to like
[64:28] if I ask you know when when did you get
[64:29] into Bitcoin or you know you can say
[64:32] well I wish I got earlier you know or or
[64:35] um like we don't we don't discuss those
[64:37] we don't ask the questions but um the 21
[64:40] SS it you know the 21 Saturdays it's
[64:42] it's a really really hard challenge to
[64:44] go for a walk every s every Saturday for
[64:47] 21 21 weeks um but it's super rewarding
[64:50] in the sense that uh like with DCA like
[64:53] you know dollars crust averaging when
[64:55] you keep on doing that no matter you
[64:58] know if if you buy on the top or the
[65:00] bottom you will you will average out and
[65:03] you'll be fine you you you actually uh
[65:05] make profits uh and you know your stock
[65:08] will be like you won't be buying too
[65:09] high for example you know um and it's
[65:11] similar to bitcoin walk and the ritual
[65:14] that you kind of keep on repeating you
[65:16] build up your um your ability to connect
[65:20] with
[65:21] bitcoiners um you know you start like
[65:24] you can always go back to the
[65:26] Magnificent questions like how does
[65:30] finite scarcity change Humanity how does
[65:33] self custody change Humanity like change
[65:35] the world that we know today um you know
[65:38] Bitcoin fixes the world Bitcoin you know
[65:40] fix the money fix the world and and
[65:41] Bitcoin does that so it's very easy to
[65:43] kind of again following the the shuhari
[65:46] rule to go back to the basics and if you
[65:49] think about the basics such as self-
[65:51] custody and uh and finite scarcity then
[65:55] from here you you can take it anywhere
[65:56] you can take it to into you know
[65:58] economics money talk you know politics
[66:00] geopolitics Game Theory philosophy
[66:03] energy environment the list goes on and
[66:05] on so it's it's a fantastic way to to
[66:09] meet people and to learn from each
[66:12] other I fully and wholeheartedly agree
[66:15] with that it's really cool uh and as I
[66:17] mentioned before we have an end routine
[66:18] in the podcast where the previous guest
[66:20] is asking a question for the next guest
[66:22] uh and uh your question from the
[66:24] previous guest is would you rather
[66:26] question would you rather nobody hold
[66:29] his own keys to bitcoin but Bitcoin will
[66:32] be the global Reserve currency or
[66:34] Bitcoin is never reaching the status of
[66:36] a global Reserve currency but everybody
[66:39] is able to hold their own
[66:42] Keys Freedom man Freedom like this is
[66:46] the question here is around do you
[66:48] prefer communism or do you prefer
[66:51] capitalism uh I prefer capital I prefer
[66:53] to be the master of my destiny so yeah
[66:56] definitely the L really really cool yeah
[66:58] perfect I think this is where my last
[67:00] guest also wanted to go right perfect
