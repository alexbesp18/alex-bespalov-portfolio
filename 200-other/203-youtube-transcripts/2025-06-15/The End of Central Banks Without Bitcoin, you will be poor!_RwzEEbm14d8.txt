[00:00] we're basically living in the biggest
[00:02] FIA bubble ever created by man Satoshi
[00:04] is a time traveler game theory is quite
[00:06] easy if if you sit on the wrong World
[00:08] Reserve currency you will get poor I
[00:10] don't think gold will be worthless if
[00:12] you have the gold price and the Bitcoin
[00:14] price the Bitcoin price will fly away
[00:16] and the central banks and the countries
[00:18] sitting on on only a gold standard will
[00:20] become poor Bitcoin exchanges like the
[00:22] black hole from the field system to the
[00:24] Bitcoin they actually forced drive to
[00:27] offboard us I thought like Drive is a
[00:29] big they should be able to fight it back
[00:32] they said okay if you don't offb btcx we
[00:36] will make sure that Amazon will not have
[00:39] the Swedish payment rails all the major
[00:41] American funds and Banks were negative
[00:43] to bitcoin but now it's really shifting
[00:46] almost every week you see Larry Fink say
[00:48] something spectacular about Bitcoin and
[00:50] Donald Trump beating burgers for Bitcoin
[00:52] one of the biggest and most influential
[00:54] fam in Sweden is valenberg they were
[00:57] co-founding the Federal Reserve in
[00:59] America and the Swedish Ricks Bank is
[01:01] still the oldest running Central Bank in
[01:03] in the western uh countries I saw a
[01:06] Bitcoin movie it was a Blockbuster movie
[01:08] it was broadcast in in all movie
[01:10] theaters all over the world and the name
[01:12] of the Bitcoin movie is Barbie Bitcoin
[01:13] is a a feminine Force it's not a
[01:16] masculine controlling or dominant Force
[01:19] it's an inclusive Force the best way to
[01:21] predict the future is to build it
[01:23] [Music]
[01:26] yourself Bitcoin exchanges are kind of
[01:28] the the the black hole from the field
[01:31] system to the Bitcoin world yeah yeah
[01:35] yes it's uh it's it's a it's very
[01:37] difficult black hole to facilitate as
[01:41] any black hole in this universe uh but
[01:44] it's it's really a narrow balance how do
[01:47] you uh manage to integrate to the Fiat
[01:50] system and the government and and and
[01:53] all that comes with with that and then
[01:55] on the which is a struggle and quite a
[01:58] hard struggle and and on the other part
[02:01] you have the Bitcoin Community which is
[02:04] super supportive and chear you on and
[02:07] helps you and and uh so so I wouldn't be
[02:12] able to to navigate this with without
[02:14] the help from all the the Bitcoin
[02:16] community so in a sense you have like a
[02:19] a two- parted job so the first the one
[02:22] thing is this amazing thing with the
[02:24] Bitcoin community and onboarding
[02:26] bitcoiners but then you also have to
[02:28] integrate with the Fe system you
[02:30] between the Matrix the operat in between
[02:34] oh yeah yeah yeah no it's yeah it's it's
[02:38] it's very schizophrenic I I could say
[02:41] some weeks you you come from a Bitcoin
[02:43] conference you're filled with energy
[02:45] vision and you're like oh yeah we we're
[02:47] going to change the world it's going to
[02:49] be so good we have a gold standard and
[02:53] and you're so enthusiastic and then you
[02:55] know get into your nitty-gritty with
[02:58] with the whatever it is in in in in the
[03:00] government or banking space and you I
[03:03] mean for example I can have a really
[03:05] good example we we were at the Bitcoin
[03:07] Atlantis in Madera the team and we had a
[03:09] great time it was a wonderful uh
[03:11] conference and mad is a beautiful island
[03:14] and we had a really good meeting we met
[03:16] with some stripe uh Crypt Bros I mean
[03:20] they're not really bitcoiners but but
[03:22] they're Crypt Bros so they kind of
[03:25] support us and we we got this lovely
[03:28] payment rails in Sweden that is very
[03:30] difficult to get and then uh two months
[03:33] later Association of banks in Sweden
[03:36] decided oh no no no a Bitcoin company
[03:39] cannot have this payment rails so then
[03:41] then they actually forced stripe to
[03:44] offboard us and uh I thought like okay
[03:48] stripe is a big company they they they
[03:51] should be able to to fight it back uh
[03:55] but the funny thing is in in U in
[03:57] response so uh the the the biggest
[04:01] payment rail in Sweden which is called
[04:03] Swiss they said okay if you don't
[04:05] offboard
[04:06] btcx uh we will make sure uh that uh
[04:11] Amazon will not have the Swedish payment
[04:13] rails so they were actually in the
[04:16] basket a Bitcoin company and Amazon and
[04:19] and you know that's how that's I mean in
[04:23] a way it's like oh they really
[04:26] don't like Bitcoin in one way or afraid
[04:28] I don't I don't know actually do the
[04:30] purpose why why why they did it but it's
[04:32] um Sweden the banks in Sweden they they
[04:36] they don't like Bitcoin do H how do they
[04:39] try to to control that because I feel
[04:41] like it Bitcoin gets more and more
[04:43] adopted we now have like Black Rock and
[04:45] on our team side we have big companies
[04:47] on our team we have even like the
[04:50] president of the of the probably most
[04:53] influential uh government in the world
[04:56] uh probably soon on our side so like how
[04:59] is this still a thing that banks are
[05:02] like no no no like that is a is a bad
[05:05] thing yeah it's a peculiar uh question
[05:10] uh because uh it is exactly what you say
[05:13] uh I mean if you go back four years that
[05:16] would make sense because Bitcoin was a
[05:18] lot smaller still it was big but it it
[05:20] was you didn't have black rock you
[05:22] didn't have I mean all the major
[05:24] American uh fund funds and Banks were
[05:28] negative to bitcoin but now it's really
[05:31] shifting it's it's uh I mean almost
[05:34] every week you see Larry say something
[05:37] spectacular about Bitcoin and uh and
[05:40] Donald Trump eating burgers for Bitcoin
[05:43] so I think it's it's going to be a
[05:46] difficult move for the Swedish Banks and
[05:49] the Swedish Central Bank because they're
[05:51] very verbal in anti Bitcoin so I I'm not
[05:55] sure how they are going to like well we
[05:58] we were wrong or oh no we always like
[06:01] Bitcoin I mean they really taken a
[06:03] negative position so it will be
[06:05] interesting to see how they manage to
[06:07] get out of that I don't know how but it
[06:09] will
[06:10] be difficult for them it's also for me
[06:13] the always the game theory aspect of it
[06:15] is super interesting when we think about
[06:17] that because we have Co countries that
[06:21] don't adopt Bitcoin or are really vocal
[06:23] about against Bitcoin which then
[06:25] probably leads to regulations that are
[06:28] against or not like Bitcoin and which
[06:31] leads then for good bitcoiners that the
[06:34] the higher tier bitcoiners to move like
[06:37] if you're high to bitcoin you have a lot
[06:38] of Bitcoin maybe you have Bitcoin
[06:40] companies you will not uh deal with a
[06:43] government that doesn't like you you
[06:44] just like oh okay I guess I can if I
[06:47] really want to also do the same thing in
[06:50] El Salvador in America in another
[06:52] different part of Europe like this game
[06:54] theory it will be really interesting uh
[06:57] to see I just see now um uh three uh
[07:02] different really popular German speaking
[07:07] uh influences in Bitcoin uh with big
[07:10] accounts who moved to El Salvador all
[07:12] three of them which is like wow like
[07:14] they they really moving they voting with
[07:16] their feet so that's that's a problem
[07:19] for those countries I feel like is do do
[07:20] you see something in in Sweden also
[07:22] where like people actually leave or is
[07:24] in general uh if you don't try try to
[07:27] open and exchange the the regulations
[07:29] around Bitcoin quite friendly or how how
[07:31] is this do people close bank accounts
[07:34] because you transfer something to
[07:35] Bitcoin exchange how how is this it's I
[07:39] would say it's a mixture uh in general
[07:43] Swedish bitcoiners are very quiet and
[07:46] and secretive if they have a social
[07:48] media account they don't use their real
[07:50] name I'm I'm really the exception I'm
[07:54] kind of the only one I'm you know I'm
[07:56] driving around with a car with a Bitcoin
[07:58] license plate and I have you know
[08:00] Bitcoin stickers everywhere where I go
[08:03] uh and my my real name on all my profile
[08:06] so so I'm kind of the the exception in
[08:08] Sweden but but it's uh I would say it
[08:12] goes back to 2014 when the the tax
[08:15] Authority in Sweden they declared war
[08:19] with Bitcoin they attacked my company uh
[08:22] a lot uh three years they they were
[08:25] trying to dig and dig and dig and find
[08:27] something they barely found anything but
[08:30] they they tried anyway and some other
[08:33] people they they they sent to jail not
[08:36] because they were doing like criminal
[08:39] activity but because the the the tax
[08:42] filing they they thought was incorrect
[08:45] uh or not good enough basically and it's
[08:48] really hard because back in
[08:50] 2014 there were no guidelines at all how
[08:53] you should tax Bitcoin and the community
[08:56] was like oh I don't want to go to
[08:57] jail or I don't want to have that
[09:00] exposure so everyone is very secretive
[09:01] and San what actually
[09:04] happened just a few weeks back is that
[09:07] the person who was sent to jail many
[09:09] years uh he was freed from all uh
[09:13] charges uh in in an appeal that came so
[09:16] that was a really good news for Sweden
[09:17] and and the tax Authority lost uh so so
[09:20] that was extremely good but but it
[09:23] anyway it did a lot of damage so uh and
[09:28] and the banks are very Eric when it come
[09:31] to offboarding of course a crypto
[09:32] company like us they they they they
[09:34] offboard but for personal uh private
[09:37] people it's a little bit on how good
[09:40] relationship you have with your bank uh
[09:43] manager uh sometimes they shut down
[09:46] without any barely any questions or or
[09:50] and sometimes they ask you know send us
[09:52] the documents and um we we actually have
[09:55] a service where where we help out with
[09:57] producing uh Bitcoin email documents for
[10:00] transaction purchase or or sell so so we
[10:03] we get usually uh High net worth
[10:06] individual or companies that that need
[10:08] help with that so so uh and then it
[10:11] usually there is no problem so it's a
[10:14] bit uh yeah but for companies at large
[10:19] like a crypto exchange it's almost
[10:22] impossible do you see uh we talked about
[10:24] that before recording do you see the MAA
[10:28] actually changing a lot of those things
[10:30] legitimizing Bitcoin to a certain extent
[10:32] and making it just normal that Bitcoin
[10:35] is another asset just like Tesla or
[10:38] another asset like gold or something
[10:40] like that it will eventually uh I mean
[10:42] ma part one is already in effect and we
[10:46] we have used that in our dialogue with
[10:49] with with the banks but it's like they
[10:52] still don't realize like oh yeah mik is
[10:55] in effect oh that's interesting uh yeah
[10:57] I don't know it's it's like they they
[11:00] don't realize or maybe they they still
[11:02] have a mindset I think the the ones who
[11:06] uh runs you know decides the the the
[11:10] narrative within the bank they they're
[11:11] quite aware of what is going on perhaps
[11:14] they don't understand Bitcoin as well um
[11:17] but then a bank like a normal Bank in
[11:19] Sweden is like 10,000 employees or maybe
[11:21] 15 and it takes time because they've
[11:24] been pushing this negative narrative for
[11:26] many years so even if it's actually
[11:29] going the other way now it takes time
[11:32] until the entire organization is is
[11:34] realizing okay now we have to now we
[11:37] should like Bitcoin instead so slowly so
[11:40] I would say maybe in a year uh even if
[11:44] after mik is implemented fully the banks
[11:46] will maybe if if someone challenge the
[11:51] the them with a lawsuit or something
[11:53] that that that could speed up the
[11:55] process that actually happened in Norway
[11:57] not with ma but with u normal banking
[12:00] guarantee uh but in Sweden it it hasn't
[12:03] happened did it ever cross your mind
[12:06] that you you might leave SW behind and
[12:09] and do the same thing somewhere else
[12:11] yeah yeah me me many times no I actually
[12:14] in
[12:16] 2019 uh in the end of
[12:18] 201 uh 19 i i me and my family we moved
[12:22] to uh Singapore it's like okay this is a
[12:25] good hub for for crypto and Bitcoin and
[12:28] like uh seems like an interesting Hub to
[12:31] to reach uh Asia at at large uh but then
[12:35] the the pandemic came a few months later
[12:37] and we decided to okay let's go back to
[12:39] Sweden it's a bit more safe or at least
[12:42] familiar and then we also went to Madera
[12:44] to check M out because that's like still
[12:46] Europe and it's a beautiful island um
[12:50] but also it didn't come a pandemic when
[12:53] we moved there but but we felt like okay
[12:55] this is this is really an island in the
[12:57] middle of the Atlantic Ocean
[12:59] so it's it's a bit small to
[13:04] say yeah but but Sweden was a good good
[13:06] place to be in the pandemic I I I
[13:09] remember I think they had kind of the
[13:11] the the most Freedom focused rules from
[13:15] most of the countries or I think it was
[13:17] Sweden right yes yes correct there was
[13:20] no lockdown uh everything was
[13:22] voluntarily and and and the government
[13:24] just gave uh
[13:26] guidelines and uh funny thing is when
[13:30] when the the pandemic broke out and we
[13:32] had the the biggest wave there it was a
[13:34] recommendation you know don't go to work
[13:37] if you have to avoid public transport
[13:39] and 80% were like yeah okay let's work
[13:42] from home without any you know lockdowns
[13:45] so it's um I would definitely say that
[13:48] lockdowns is is so unnecessary in in in
[13:51] those aspects because people in general
[13:54] don't want u a virus that might be
[13:57] lethal for them you you you don't need
[13:59] to force someone to be at home when
[14:03] there's a virus running around but yeah
[14:05] no so so no Sweden was actually quite
[14:07] nice it's super interesting on the one
[14:09] side they're they're fighting Bitcoin
[14:12] but then when it comes to the virus
[14:14] where the whole world was kind of on on
[14:18] like one trajectory oh we have lockdowns
[14:20] there were really not a lot of countries
[14:22] was Sweden the only one what other
[14:24] countries even like they had no
[14:25] lockdowns I don't remember but the whole
[14:28] world is kind of that trajectory and
[14:30] Sweden is like no no like now we let it
[14:33] the the free market decide but with
[14:35] Bitcoin it's like no no like okay
[14:37] Bitcoin in America the president is
[14:40] talking about it and implemented black
[14:42] Rog likes it but we will fight against
[14:44] it like it's an it's it's a weird thing
[14:46] like have that so Sweden has an
[14:50] interesting history when it comes to
[14:51] finance um one of the biggest and most
[14:55] influential fam in in Sweden is
[14:57] valenberg they they're part of the
[14:59] Bilderberg uh group or Association uh
[15:03] they were co-founding the Federal
[15:05] Reserve in America and the Swedish Ricks
[15:07] Bank is still the oldest running uh rck
[15:11] Central Bank in in the western uh
[15:13] countries or maybe in the world it's
[15:15] about 400 and that was also uh
[15:18] co-founded from this uh family uh so so
[15:22] so they have a tradition of U I don't
[15:25] know um what to call it but tradition of
[15:28] of fiia
[15:30] running back many 100 years so it could
[15:32] be linked to to to that that this family
[15:36] uh is so um invested in in the Fiat
[15:40] system that they really don't like
[15:43] Bitcoin uh and and and that they are
[15:45] like controlling the the financial area
[15:48] and when it comes to um yeah uh health
[15:52] concerns there there's of course we have
[15:55] a big medical company uh but the the the
[15:59] government structure in Sweden or the
[16:02] the smaller governments we have a lot of
[16:03] you know branches they're kind of
[16:06] decentralized in one way uh so so they
[16:10] it's it's not the top uh Parliament
[16:13] that's deciding what what to do a
[16:15] lockdown or not so it could be yeah and
[16:19] and and that's like the really
[16:20] interesting thing with Sweden because
[16:22] it's small country you don't have that
[16:23] many banks and and U and the major bank
[16:28] is owned by this family and if you look
[16:31] at the financial supervisor many people
[16:34] go there to to uh to get a merit for
[16:38] your CV uh so you go there you work a
[16:40] few years and then your goal is mostly
[16:43] to have a job at a bank so they they
[16:46] don't want to do something that is bad
[16:50] for for their career so since you have
[16:53] that interaction of of people or flow of
[16:56] people the financial conduct Authority
[16:58] is um very friendly to the to the bank
[17:02] big Banks I assume when when uh btcx
[17:06] become as big as the bigger Banks we
[17:08] will start to employ all these people
[17:10] from the government and they
[17:13] then become friendly to us as well but
[17:16] so far we we're too small for that um I
[17:19] think you started the the btcx quite
[17:21] early uh was it 2012 what I read that
[17:25] that is that is super early wow so like
[17:27] you you had uh
[17:29] you you fight for for Debs in in a long
[17:31] time indeed so 20 yeah we launched in
[17:34] January 2012 mostly like a hobby project
[17:38] is is there an interest for for Bitcoin
[17:40] in uh in Sweden and at that time we we
[17:44] bought Bitcoin at Mount GX in Japan so
[17:48] it was quite it took long time and it
[17:50] was quite a challenge to to to actually
[17:53] buy Bitcoin um but for me that was also
[17:56] my aha moment for Bitcoin I I was
[17:59] sending I think it was 50 or 500 Swedish
[18:02] crer to to Japan and it took almost s
[18:05] days and it costed I think it was like
[18:08] 15% of in transaction fee in the end and
[18:11] then I bought Bitcoin at
[18:13] mgx and at that time uh all wallets or
[18:17] there wasn't that many wallets but the
[18:19] the Bitcoin QT wallet you saw it re
[18:22] already in the wallet when you had zero
[18:24] confirmation so it was like super fast
[18:27] so I was sitting there having sent my
[18:29] money went waited for a week and then I
[18:31] took withdraw from the mount GX and the
[18:34] same millisecond I pressed withdraw it
[18:37] popped up in my wallet and and and that
[18:41] feeling for me was like holy crap this
[18:44] will you know cut the cut the
[18:49] competition in pieces uh and and so so
[18:53] from from that I I realized okay this
[18:55] this will change the entire Financial
[18:57] system that we have and um and had had
[19:00] that feeling ever since since that day
[19:03] so for you it was the the medium of
[19:07] exchange size of things what what made
[19:10] you really get Bitcoin in the beginning
[19:12] yeah so I have zero background in
[19:15] finance I'm a Quantum physicist computer
[19:17] nerd so I was studying uh quantum
[19:20] physics and computer science and some
[19:24] astrology nothing about money but the
[19:26] funny thing is my my mom who is also
[19:28] Bitcoin Maxi she's actually more Bitcoin
[19:30] Maxi than than I am I have dabbled in
[19:33] alternative coins like Litecoin and
[19:36] Dogecoin H she's only owned Bitcoin that
[19:39] which is quite impressive uh but she she
[19:43] built the first internet Bank in in
[19:45] Sweden back in the '90s but otherwise
[19:47] from that I have no experience with
[19:49] money money so all my uh experience with
[19:54] with the financial system I have learned
[19:55] during the way uh with running a Bitcoin
[19:58] company
[19:59] and I would say every day I learn
[20:01] something new about the Legacy Finance
[20:04] system which makes me like oh it's
[20:08] it's even worse I mean every day I find
[20:12] something new it's like so I'm I'm yeah
[20:15] I'm super grateful that that I found
[20:17] Bitcoin early or not in one way it
[20:20] really doesn't matter the only important
[20:22] thing is that we have a system that is
[20:25] free to use it's it's it's fairly and
[20:28] trans parently built and it's un
[20:32] uncorruptible the protocol itself and
[20:35] and for me that's that that really gives
[20:37] me you know hope for for the future uh
[20:40] and for my my family and kids so so
[20:43] that's yeah really good um I had uh o
[20:50] also on the podcast and uh he was also
[20:54] in Vienna a guest to me and and we we
[20:57] did the podcast in person uh and uh I
[21:00] don't know why but for some reason you
[21:02] came up in the discussion and he and I
[21:04] said to him oh I will also have him on
[21:06] the podcast and he said to me please ask
[21:08] him why his exchange is pink
[21:12] so I I will fulfill his I will fulfill
[21:15] his stream and and ask you know why why
[21:18] pink why why that
[21:19] color yeah yeah yeah so we used to be uh
[21:23] orange surprise surprise orange uh dark
[21:26] gray uh and then it's yeah it's kind of
[21:29] funny but it's um then I I saw a um a
[21:33] Bitcoin movie it was a Blockbuster movie
[21:36] it was uh broadcast in in all movie
[21:40] theaters all over the world uh and the
[21:42] name of the Bitcoin movie is Barbie uh I
[21:45] I I I don't think Norm normis uh or nor
[21:49] coiners or how to call them realize it's
[21:52] a Bitcoin movie but but if you put on
[21:54] your Bitcoin glasses it's clearly a
[21:57] Bitcoin movie and you see like the
[21:59] patriarch is the Fiat system it's
[22:01] controlled it's like top down uh and
[22:05] it's all about getting ahead of of
[22:07] everyone else right and the Barbie
[22:10] Community they just have money and it
[22:12] works and there's no drama about it it's
[22:15] no they don't need a a government or
[22:17] policy around it it's just fair and
[22:20] equal system that that works and that's
[22:23] obviously Bitcoin and and um if you
[22:27] haven't seen the movie they they
[22:28] actually have a war in in a war erupts
[22:33] uh between the the patriarch and The
[22:34] Matriarch and and you can see it it's
[22:38] like the the Fiat system and and the
[22:39] Bitcoin system is is undergoing a war so
[22:42] I saw that movie and like holy okay
[22:46] um both that okay Barbie is a Bitcoin
[22:48] movie but then like we uh women really
[22:52] need Bitcoin because they are uh in the
[22:56] current system very uh much um what you
[23:01] say they're not as far ahead in the game
[23:04] in the Fiat game and in some countries
[23:07] women are not even allowed to have a
[23:10] bank account or even own money and from
[23:13] from my perspective not being voke or
[23:16] anything like that but I truly believe
[23:18] that the feminine and the masculine
[23:20] force uh like life force uh should be
[23:24] equally balanced and when we have a
[23:26] balance between the masculine and The
[23:27] Feminine the world looks uh naturally
[23:31] more harmonized and one way to to find
[23:34] this harmony is to to to utilize Bitcoin
[23:38] and and from that I also realized okay
[23:40] but Bitcoin is um it's a feminine Force
[23:44] it's not a
[23:45] masculine uh controlling uh or dominant
[23:49] Force it's it's an inclusive force it
[23:51] was just like Okay I uh I I I want to
[23:56] emphasize this and we changed the col
[23:58] from Orange to to Pink so that's story
[24:02] did the
[24:04] color influence um positively impact the
[24:09] quote of how many women buy Bitcoin on
[24:12] newor Exchange do you even have that
[24:15] information we we do have the
[24:17] information I haven't checked I mean it
[24:18] was quite quite recently we changed the
[24:20] color was before the summer and we we
[24:23] haven't seen any significant uptick but
[24:26] we haven't done any marketing either but
[24:29] what we are doing we we have uh women
[24:32] only uh meetups in our office which is
[24:35] taking place so we think this is
[24:39] probably a more longer uh marketing
[24:42] trajectory and also for the entire
[24:46] Community to uh to think about because
[24:49] it's very masculine dominated but but
[24:50] women are are catching up more and more
[24:52] so so it's uh and also my my wife she is
[24:57] now working in the company company and
[24:59] she started
[25:00] this like a few weeks after we changed
[25:04] to to to to Pink uh or actually the
[25:08] color is not pink it's actually magenta
[25:10] but it's yeah more or less the same so I
[25:12] think it's a Gradle shift uh and then
[25:15] also from a marketing perspective I
[25:17] haven't seen any uh pink or magenta
[25:20] Bitcoin company out there so we we might
[25:23] be the the the only pink Bitcoin if you
[25:26] watch or listen to my pod on a regular
[25:29] basis I'll guess you already bought some
[25:31] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[25:34] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[25:37] in a hardware wallet my personal
[25:39] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[25:41] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[25:44] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[25:46] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[25:49] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[25:53] with the code Robin at the checkout
[25:55] visit bitbox do Swiss
[25:58] in to get your bitbox and the next step
[26:01] is to really level up your sovereignty
[26:03] as an individual you have to have the
[26:05] most secure self- custody setup you have
[26:08] to secure your own devices you have to
[26:11] protect your privacy you have to set up
[26:14] an inheritance plan and depending on
[26:17] where you live you even want to have a
[26:19] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[26:22] in case something goes really really
[26:24] wrong and through all those steps the
[26:26] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[26:29] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin

[26:41] and last but not least I have something
[26:43] completely new for you guys I partnered
[26:46] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[26:50] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[26:53] saw created by anyone look at that
[26:55] beauty I love it so much coin vigilant
[26:58] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[27:01] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[27:04] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[27:07] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[27:10] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[27:13] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[27:17] watch collections you have the date of
[27:19] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[27:23] there and of course also the block
[27:25] height and which EPO we are currently in
[27:28] I love the level of detail they put in
[27:31] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[27:33] check out those amazing coin vilant the
[27:36] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[27:39] love those watches so so
[27:42] much and I think it definitely works in
[27:45] terms of like it it uh you see it I saw
[27:49] the car uh that you were talking about
[27:51] at Bitcoin Prague and it was like so
[27:54] like you could see it from afar you're
[27:56] like oh yeah that's that's the
[27:58] car that was coming you saw it on
[28:00] Twitter before and now it's here I think
[28:02] it's it's great marketing also yeah yeah
[28:05] no the the car with the Bitcoin license
[28:07] plate and and the pink color is is uh
[28:11] yeah I mean uh another funny thing is uh
[28:15] so I I drive around with with with the
[28:16] Bitcoin car in in Stockholm and I can
[28:21] just see sometimes you know I know Park
[28:24] in the middle of the city uh take a
[28:26] coffee nearby and and and work and I can
[28:28] see people looking at the car or
[28:31] actually they're looking at the Bitcoin
[28:32] we have big Bitcoin stickers and design
[28:34] and whatever and um I I can I can just
[28:39] by watching how people interact with
[28:41] with with the Bitcoin branding I can see
[28:43] like where the momentum in the market is
[28:46] and I could say that
[28:48] currently uh since I would say maybe two
[28:52] since two weeks back more and more
[28:54] people are interacting W with it so I
[28:58] it's really a momentum building in in in
[29:00] at least in in Stockholm but we have a
[29:03] lot of tourists here so and more people
[29:06] are turning the head more people are
[29:07] picking up the phone and taking P
[29:09] picture of of of the Bitcoin signs so I
[29:12] I I think it's um if you want a measure
[29:16] of something that's the measure saying
[29:18] the the the market is is starting to to
[29:21] wake up now so it's time
[29:24] to time to hit that buy button again
[29:28] it's I think it's it's definitely uh
[29:31] nice I also um catch myself now checking
[29:34] the price again I I actually did not do
[29:37] that for the I think the whole summer uh
[29:40] and uh it started right now because now
[29:44] it's like this is excitement is is more
[29:46] here uh more and more people keep asking
[29:49] about Bitcoin like I feel like we are in
[29:51] this right now actually at the start of
[29:54] the the Bull Run obviously yes the last
[29:57] year bit coin went up significantly like
[30:00] it's not that we like completely
[30:02] sideways like the Bitcoin price a year
[30:04] ago uh was way lower than now but it
[30:07] didn't feel like a bull run it it felt
[30:10] like sideways for some reason but now I
[30:12] feel like we actually on the cusp of of
[30:15] of a of a major Bull Run most likely uh
[30:20] so that that that feels um it feels
[30:22] better now and and I catch myself
[30:25] checking the price more often uh and
[30:27] like just a few months ago I didn't
[30:28] check it for like months sometimes like
[30:31] because I truly didn't care but now
[30:34] sometimes like two or three times a day
[30:35] and that's really a lot for me to to
[30:38] check the Bitcoin price I I think we can
[30:41] decide that the bull market is just
[30:42] about to start we we we decide that yeah
[30:45] you and
[30:47] me so now it's the start yes it's
[30:51] decided let's revisit that let's do a
[30:54] podcast the second round in one year and
[30:56] then then see how much it went up do you
[30:59] have some some some way of of thinking
[31:01] about the price some some like framework
[31:04] about like where you where we will be if
[31:07] if we actually do a podcast in one year
[31:09] yeah I usually have that but but funny
[31:11] enough I I don't have that uh this cycle
[31:15] I think my let's say my
[31:18] internal models broke when we hit
[31:22] alltime high in in yeah during Bitcoin
[31:25] Atlantis that was actually really great
[31:27] and yeah so so so so my my my sense I I
[31:30] I don't have like a like an algorithm I
[31:32] use but it's like a you know hand waving
[31:36] and and that model is kind of okay there
[31:38] is so much new monetary energy that
[31:43] enters the Bitcoin ecosystem now so it's
[31:46] it's it's a it's I I would say the price
[31:48] is now a new kind of animal uh I I'm not
[31:53] that familiar with it but uh definitely
[31:56] it will go up uh so in let's say in one
[32:01] year if I'm just going to grab a number
[32:04] let's say 200% from today 200% that's a
[32:08] fre X right so that that's uh from here
[32:11] on out that would be 65k oh man I'm
[32:15] really bad in
[32:18] MAF you can put it in the show notes
[32:20] afterward that's that's 195k so let's
[32:23] say two 200% and then we are at uh 200k
[32:29] yeah that's easy yes yeah that that
[32:31] that's an easy thing thing to remember I
[32:33] think with the actual price we might
[32:35] even be a little bit before before se7
[32:38] or something like that but yeah um that
[32:40] that sounds about right um one question
[32:43] that I had before we move off the the
[32:46] Barbie topic I have one more Barbie
[32:49] question um if you had to recommend a
[32:52] Bitcoin
[32:54] movie would you still recommend Barbie
[32:56] or more Matrix like if you just if you
[32:59] can just recommend only one movie that
[33:02] is a Bitcoin movie and not directly
[33:04] about Bitcoin um is is Barbie or or
[33:08] Matrix the bigger one uh all right it's
[33:10] not supposed to be a Bitcoin movie is
[33:13] that what you're saying yeah exactly
[33:14] like I think both like for me Matrix and
[33:17] I just um watch for the first time ever
[33:20] actually the third part of it I only
[33:22] watched the first part and now I I I
[33:25] start to watch the third part I never
[33:27] came to it that's why Matrix right now
[33:28] is in my head and I'm like oh like
[33:30] that that's a great meme for Bitcoin
[33:31] that's a great meme for Bitcoin it's
[33:33] it's like you you watch it five 10
[33:35] minutes and you're like I can use that
[33:37] exact um comparison for Bitcoin so for
[33:41] me Matrix was always this big movie that
[33:45] is not about Bitcoin but as a bitcoiner
[33:48] you constantly think about Bitcoin and I
[33:51] did not watch Bobby uh so but I I I
[33:54] think I have to have to do that now
[33:57] because you made curious about it uh
[33:59] good good question there's actually a
[34:02] couple of movies that pops up in my mind
[34:04] right now Matrix is of course um a
[34:08] classic Bitcoin movie um Barbie is a
[34:12] good one but it's if if if you're not a
[34:15] bitcoiner you you will not I think it
[34:17] will be hard to notice it uh and then
[34:20] Fight Club I really enjoy uh it also
[34:24] ends with with really um ending the the
[34:28] Fiat system or at least parts of it but
[34:31] it's a bit violent but that's Matrix as
[34:34] well um what
[34:37] else yeah Interstellar is also extremely
[34:41] good uh but I haven't
[34:43] seen fight club or Interstellar for a
[34:46] long time so it's hard to to decide but
[34:48] um so then I then I'll go for uh then
[34:51] I'll go with with the barar movie I love
[34:54] that a lot really really cool it's uh I
[34:57] think uh I have to really watch it now
[35:00] um my my girlfriend will be very happy
[35:02] because we did not watch it till
[35:04] now exactly watch it with uh um a woman
[35:09] and see if you if you can um use the mve
[35:12] it to to orange pill or pink so so you
[35:15] think that uh with the Barbie movie you
[35:19] can orange peel uh woman you should
[35:24] try it's I find it very hard I mean I I
[35:28] I I got orange peeled extremely fast
[35:31] with Bitcoin um so I can just share a
[35:35] short story about when I found Bitcoin
[35:36] it was in
[35:38] 2011 uh I went to this free open source
[35:40] software Meetup uh in a basement a lot
[35:43] of uh Geeks uh computer geeks and and
[35:47] uh nice people and I was sitting there
[35:52] with my laptop everyone had their laptop
[35:54] or some other computer device and I was
[35:57] complaining about the financial system
[35:58] and the guy next to me who is still
[36:00] unknown I don't know who orange pilled
[36:02] me uh he said that oh yeah but have you
[36:05] looked about Bitcoin like oh what's that
[36:07] it's open source money and for me that
[36:10] was the orange pill open source plus
[36:13] money H and I love open source I mean
[36:16] that Community contribute Etc all all
[36:19] the values are are aligning and and open
[36:21] source money so that that was the thing
[36:24] that that made me uh start with Bitcoin
[36:26] but for my wife was different I mean
[36:29] I've been trying to Orange Peel her for
[36:31] for for 10 years and then she was uh
[36:34] driving my car and I had a podcast in
[36:36] the car playing Peter McCormack's one of
[36:40] his episodes and my wife she's half
[36:42] British and cormack is is Brit so so she
[36:46] instantly synchronized with his humor so
[36:49] in for her she was like oh but this is
[36:52] funny maybe I should listen to more
[36:54] about Bitcoin so so humor was the first
[36:57] step for her and then she she read a
[37:01] book written by Swedish person BJ T he
[37:07] wrote a book called Bitcoin hand booken
[37:09] which is like the Bitcoin manual very
[37:12] short and sweet book and she read it in
[37:14] maybe one hour and then after that she
[37:17] was like we have to have more
[37:20] Bitcoin I was like what yes now I mean
[37:23] the Fiat system it was like it clicked
[37:26] for her so it's it 10 years it took for
[37:30] for for uh for her to to you know living
[37:35] with me for for many years and and a
[37:37] book finally sealed it so so it's
[37:39] difficult to know what actually will
[37:41] Orange Peel someone so looking at a
[37:42] Barbie movie could be one puzzle piece
[37:45] of the puzzle I love it a lot I I will
[37:48] definitely try it and now I have a good
[37:49] answer why why why pink uh and I will
[37:53] send it to O
[37:55] definitely um coming back to Bitcoin and
[37:58] and where do you see it it's really
[37:59] interesting when you are in Bitcoin that
[38:01] long in 2011 um you probably had a way
[38:05] different few on bitcoin back then than
[38:07] you have now you probably have learned a
[38:09] lot and and developed your few on
[38:11] bitcoin um maybe shortly explain this uh
[38:16] how differently you view it and maybe
[38:18] then also how do you think bitcoin's
[38:21] role will be like in 10 20 30 years from
[38:24] now where do you see Bitcoin growing not
[38:26] from a price perspective but really like
[38:28] what's the role of Bitcoin in the future
[38:31] in our society could start with saying
[38:35] that understanding Bitcoin is um vast
[38:41] subject I I started reading the white
[38:44] paper trying to understand it from a
[38:47] technical
[38:49] perspective and it is it's it's a short
[38:52] and sweet white paper but still
[38:55] it's it's logic is not easily understood
[39:00] and you can see this that that many
[39:03] smart people Michael sailor for example
[39:06] uh Elon
[39:07] Musk Etc at first they don't get Bitcoin
[39:12] and then suddenly something happens and
[39:14] then then Michael sailor really went all
[39:17] in I wouldn't say Alon understand
[39:19] Bitcoin yet uh but he has at least tried
[39:22] to do it a few times it's a journey
[39:25] definitely and and for me that Journey
[39:27] is still ongoing I still learning new
[39:29] aspect of Bitcoin I I was like oh
[39:32] okay you can see it uh from this
[39:35] perspective as well so so for me Bitcoin
[39:37] has been I mean as I said U open source
[39:40] money was my first entrance Point like
[39:44] yes of course money should be open it
[39:45] should be a a standard that anyone could
[39:49] use and then realizing like okay fixed
[39:52] Supply uh and and not buying into the
[39:55] The Narrative that a 2% inflation is
[39:58] something good 2% inflation is ex
[40:00] extremely bad for the society which
[40:02] you're bearing the fruits of right now
[40:06] uh and and and that takes also a lot of
[40:09] perspective uh so I I would say and of
[40:13] yeah and then
[40:15] mining which is a really silly uh uh uh
[40:19] what do you say narrative Bitcoin mining
[40:23] I I when I talk about it nowadays I say
[40:26] no it's um block producers because
[40:30] that's they they're producing a block uh
[40:32] and and validating the transaction and
[40:35] putting a uh sign as signature seal of
[40:39] approval which is the
[40:41] sha256 uh number that they they've
[40:44] calculated but let's call it mining now
[40:47] um mining is also very hard to grasp how
[40:51] it's actually working and it is the
[40:56] innov
[40:58] or Discovery as some some would like to
[41:01] see it that is the discovery of of
[41:03] Bitcoin the the the mining and the other
[41:05] parts are yes a very beautiful way to to
[41:08] put the the the the pieces of the
[41:11] algorith together so and and that's also
[41:14] another aspect like the the beauty of
[41:16] the Simplicity and uh for many years
[41:20] many still people say okay but there
[41:23] will be a better Bitcoin I say no there
[41:26] won't
[41:27] because every other blockchain or
[41:30] copycat or or uh crypto adds
[41:35] something it h makes the system more
[41:38] complex but no one has managed of all
[41:41] the millions of of projects I mean it's
[41:44] open source so anyone can copy it have
[41:46] failed to make it more simple and and
[41:49] that's also like like oh this is
[41:52] the most simple way to create a currency
[41:55] that is you know functioning as it is uh
[41:59] and and that's also like a a huge aha
[42:03] feeling and then of course I'm a Quantum
[42:05] physicist so looking at the the way how
[42:09] can we secure a system using the most
[42:14] simple form of
[42:17] transaction there is in in the universe
[42:20] which is
[42:20] energy the most simple form of work is
[42:23] energy and having a monetary
[42:27] or a currency or a system using energy
[42:30] as as a as a basis level is also like
[42:33] mindblowing and this was something that
[42:36] both uh Harrison Ford and maybe it was
[42:40] Tesla as well I don't recall yeah I
[42:42] think it was Tesla uh a 100 years ago
[42:45] was trying to achieve like an energy
[42:47] buck and then they failed because they
[42:50] hadn't the technology as we have today
[42:53] we we have the the computer uh that
[42:55] helps us to to achieve this so we needed
[42:58] to discover both the computer and then
[43:01] the the the algorithm of of mining to to
[43:04] achieve Bitcoin and so so from a
[43:07] scientific perspective this is also like
[43:09] mind-blowing so so there's so many
[43:11] aspects of Bitcoin that are as so
[43:13] elegantly and And Timely to occur right
[43:17] now or
[43:19] 2008 which is uh so fascinating so I I I
[43:24] I still learn new things about Bitcoin
[43:27] that that fascinates me and looking
[43:31] ahead in in the future uh it's it's it's
[43:34] very difficult to to see where this will
[43:38] be heading uh we have this major Fiat
[43:42] system on
[43:43] steroids and uh the the best way to to
[43:47] to look at the future or to predict the
[43:50] future is is to build it yourself and
[43:52] the second best is to look at at at the
[43:55] history and you you can
[43:58] see like so many times we had a currency
[44:02] we also always had a currency and
[44:06] always someone have tried to manipulate
[44:09] it create more of that currency and if
[44:12] we have gold as a as as the currency the
[44:15] the the king is trying to dilute the
[44:17] gold with something else you know always
[44:19] always always but the monetary system
[44:22] has never had a digital way that is
[44:25] connected to everyone
[44:27] and so easily diluted I mean it's
[44:31] ridiculously easy to dilute the currency
[44:35] today and you can see it in the dollar
[44:37] you can see it in the Swedish crowner
[44:38] and the Euro so I think we'll have the a
[44:41] historical Fiat crash uh I mean we we're
[44:46] basically living in the in the biggest
[44:49] Fiat bubble ever created by man and we
[44:53] have this uh Bitcoin um invention at the
[44:58] at the same time so it's almost like
[45:00] this is so perfectly fitted so so I'm
[45:03] also buying into that time travel
[45:05] narrative that that Satoshi is a time
[45:08] traveler it's like okay mankind will
[45:10] eradicate itself when the Fiat B Bubble
[45:12] Burst so I will go to 2008 and place the
[45:16] white paper here um but yeah but it's
[45:20] it's still very hard to see where where
[45:22] where we will end up but but I really uh
[45:25] hope and wish for a peaceful resolution
[45:28] and that we manage to get Humanity over
[45:31] to a Bitcoin standard and and build like
[45:34] best possible world we can could achieve
[45:38] uh because we have a lot of energy uh we
[45:40] never had so much energy production in
[45:42] the world as we have and then we also
[45:45] have the tools for communication and now
[45:47] we have the monetary system and The
[45:50] Innovation uh so so hopefully we enter a
[45:54] new golden age um when we merge to the
[45:58] the Bitcoin
[45:59] standard I loved it so much I never
[46:01] heard that like it's so fascinating I uh
[46:05] now almost 300 podcast episodes with a
[46:07] Bitcoin podcast I do it daily but I
[46:09] never heard the theory that do Nakamoto
[46:12] is a time traveler that's then it never
[46:16] came up F so like the theory is that s
[46:19] Nakamoto is a time traveler from the
[46:20] future he saw how Humanity was going bad
[46:23] with fear and that's why he came uh back
[46:26] just in time to invent Bitcoin and get
[46:29] people uh to adopt a Sal money digital
[46:32] standard yes and you can see it in the
[46:34] first block I mean celor on the brink of
[46:38] the second bailout so it's it's really
[46:40] like it's a statement like the Fiat
[46:42] system is going wayo but
[46:45] yeah I I I I don't say I believe that
[46:48] theory but it's it's a it's a very it's
[46:51] a very nice Theory I love that uh
[46:55] Bitcoin proves that uh time traveling is
[46:57] a real
[46:58] [Music]
[47:00] thing yes yeah that that that would be
[47:03] like the perfect last piece of the
[47:05] Bitcoin puzzle yeah that that would be
[47:08] amazing I mean uh it's it's it's a a
[47:11] really cool topic uh one last question
[47:14] that I have for you uh maybe an
[47:15] interesting one um when we look at the
[47:20] feat world and when you look also the
[47:22] banking world and and uh no coiners what
[47:26] do you think is right now the biggest
[47:30] misconception among those who uh
[47:33] publicly are against Bitcoin I'm not
[47:36] talking about the no coiners who just
[47:38] like didn't do any research but the
[47:40] people that actually say like oh like
[47:42] Bitcoin is a scam like Jamie Diamond or
[47:44] like Bitcoin is not good for like like
[47:46] the central Bankers or is it with them
[47:50] just they they hate it so much uh or or
[47:54] are there really like things in the head
[47:56] like oh like Bitcoin cannot work because
[47:58] of that what what do you think uh that
[48:00] is yes it's both uh some people don't
[48:05] have the incentives I mean they all to
[48:07] to to to like Bitcoin uh because they're
[48:10] so invested in the the the Central Bank
[48:14] um Fiat system so so anything that
[48:18] disrupts that is um bad for them so that
[48:22] that's one and and and they maybe
[48:25] understand Bitcoin or not or maybe it
[48:27] really doesn't matter but then you have
[48:29] the other part that that is um just
[48:32] don't understand Bitcoin
[48:34] and it's kind of understandable because
[48:38] it is tricky to understand the aspects
[48:41] or it could be that they might
[48:44] misconcept um I mean there's there's so
[48:48] many misconceptions about Bitcoin so
[48:50] it's it's it's mad it's like yeah it's
[48:54] yeah never mind uh um so it's hard to
[48:58] pick one uh misconception about Bitcoin
[49:02] but it all yeah I guess if there's
[49:07] someone for example the the the the
[49:10] general of the Central Bank in Sweden he
[49:12] he said he wants to uh make sure Bitcoin
[49:15] does not get integrated to the banking
[49:17] system for
[49:19] him I I think his
[49:22] misconception is he is's missing the
[49:26] power of Bitcoin or rather the the
[49:28] network
[49:29] effect and what what or Game Theory what
[49:34] are the consequence of of playing
[49:37] Bitcoin in the wrong way and uh one of
[49:43] the consequences happened was it 100
[49:46] years ago or something like that you had
[49:49] a the the world was living in both a
[49:52] gold standard and a silver standard and
[49:54] the price difference was rough
[49:57] the same difference as as the abundance
[49:59] of of the the the natural resources
[50:02] scattered around the earth um but
[50:06] after now I don't remember exactly what
[50:09] what dates and and and series of events
[50:12] but what happened is that China and
[50:15] India were on the silver standard and
[50:16] the Western countries were on the gold
[50:19] standard and the the silver standard
[50:22] lost as as a world resource uh world
[50:26] serve currency so the gold price
[50:29] skyrocketed and the silver was plummeted
[50:32] and the game theory is quite easy if you
[50:34] if you sit on the wrong uh World Reserve
[50:38] currency you will get poor and yes uh I
[50:41] think India lost about between 75 and
[50:43] 80% of their wealth uh because they're
[50:46] sitting on Silver and and China lost
[50:49] even more I think they lost above 80
[50:52] maybe
[50:55] 85% so basically they they they they
[50:57] they play the the game theory wrong and
[51:00] and and that's from a central bank
[51:03] perspective is the biggest risk they're
[51:07] taking and the misconception they're
[51:09] they're doing is that they are
[51:12] miscalculating the the network effect of
[51:15] of of Bitcoin so sitting many central
[51:17] banks today they're sitting with
[51:19] American dollars and they're sitting
[51:21] with gold I don't think gold will be
[51:23] worthless if you have the gold price and
[51:26] the Bitcoin price the Bitcoin price will
[51:29] fly away uh and and the central banks
[51:32] and the countes sitting on on only a
[51:34] gold standard will become poor
[51:38] basically interesting I think yeah it's
[51:41] super interesting when you think about
[51:42] all those people who are um against
[51:45] Bitcoin or like uh C currently having
[51:49] some problems understanding it I think
[51:51] the the big the the best point you
[51:53] brought up is like the power the game
[51:55] theory they don't get what really like
[51:57] the they don't really have a choice so
[52:00] they either have to uh join it or uh
[52:03] they will lose out in in a big way
[52:05] that's why I'm also really impressed
[52:07] with some German banks that already try
[52:09] to adopt it and really try to um embrace
[52:13] it even have like Bitcoin conferences in
[52:16] Germany like it's a big big thing uh and
[52:19] those are probably the commercial banks
[52:22] that uh will win I don't know how a
[52:24] central bank can embrace R it outside of
[52:28] just buying it from a gamef perspective
[52:31] but it doesn't seem like Sweden will be
[52:33] the first one to do that uh and I think
[52:37] Swiss didn't Swiss buy micro strategy
[52:40] stock I I heard some like Swiss is
[52:43] probably like the closest one to to buy
[52:46] actual Bitcoin but I heard something
[52:47] that they they are with with micro
[52:49] strategy but that's
[52:51] unconfirmed I'm not sure if that's true
[52:54] uh but yeah it's game fa is playing out
[52:56] I love how how we actually can see that
[52:58] in the in the world already it also ties
[53:00] back to what we were talking in the in
[53:02] the
[53:03] beginning I really like what what you
[53:05] said there really
[53:07] cool uh also um we have endro in the
[53:11] podcast about two questions the first
[53:13] question is always the same question for
[53:15] for each guest uh and it is what can we
[53:18] learn from you uh besides
[53:21] Bitcoin I would like to give a
[53:27] um piece of advice or or practice and um
[53:31] that is to to
[53:33] practice well I would say two things and
[53:36] and one is um to practice the the the
[53:40] time Horizon which you you think and act
[53:42] from and in instead of having I mean the
[53:48] Fiat World encourage uh short short
[53:51] sight and and not planning uh long
[53:54] ahead um and uh
[53:57] ironically one one thing to practice um
[54:01] thinking ahead or or planning a long
[54:04] time in the future is to uh be in in the
[54:08] present so it's kind of Contra inuitive
[54:11] uh in one way but so I I would just you
[54:13] know like to give that thought that take
[54:17] an extra breath uh when you can think
[54:22] about it and come to the present moment
[54:25] and from there can expand your time
[54:28] Horizon actually how how far in the
[54:30] future you you you like so that is the
[54:35] gift I would like to give to the to the
[54:37] listener love that a lot um really
[54:39] really being in present is is probably
[54:42] more important uh than than looking in
[54:44] the
[54:45] future yes even though sometimes it's
[54:48] it's good to to to see if I had yeah
[54:51] really cool thank you so much I have an
[54:52] end routine of the podcast where the
[54:54] previous guest is asking a question for
[54:56] next guest without knowing who the next
[54:57] guest actually is and this is an
[54:59] interesting one um we already had the
[55:02] same question kind of for for movies but
[55:05] now we have the same questions again for
[55:08] songs if there was if there was a
[55:10] Bitcoin song uh which song Would it be
[55:16] uh uh so what pops up in my mind is um
[55:21] of course ABA being from Sweden and it's
[55:23] uh they have a song called money money
[55:25] money
[55:26] [Laughter]
[55:30] I'm not sure how that translate into
[55:32] Bitcoin but it's uh it's a lovely song
[55:35] and it uh gets you to think about money
[55:40] and uh and uh it's a good time to to
[55:43] think about what is money anyway I love
[55:46] it a lot I I thought maybe the the song
[55:51] uh Pump It Up you you know it yeah yeah
[55:54] yes you get to Pump It Up you know bump
[55:56] it up I love that song so much and I
[55:58] think even on YouTube one of the first
[56:01] most lik comments is like that's the
[56:03] official Bitcoin song or something like
[56:04] that so it's it seems to
[56:07] be for for me that would be a big big
[56:10] one also on
[56:12] there yeah that's a funny song
[56:14] definitely really really cool then yeah
